Abstract
In this project, a novel control architecture with terminal sliding mode (TSM), which
employs a ridge Gaussian neural network to approximate nonlinear functions, is proposed to
achieve finite-time and high-precision control. Different from most traditional control theorems
that provide asymptotically stable, the terminal sliding mode control can speed up the
convergence. The ridge Gaussian neural network is a multi-layer neural network with Gaussian
activation function. Moreover, the closed-loop stability and tracking performance can be proved
by Lyapunov theory with TSM finite-time control. Finally, not only theorems can be verified by
simulations, but also can be implemented by hardware. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed controller for induction motors, a torque command from a PC-based DSP card will send
to the driver to control an industrial induction motor.
Index Terms - terminal sliding mode control, neural networks, induction motor.

induction motor in section IV. Finally, section V concludes the paper.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Ridge Gaussian neural network
An n-input and single-output RGNN consists of three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and
output layer. The neurons in hidden layer called the ridge Gaussian activation functions (RGAFs)
are linear combined to produce the outputs as
1
p
j j
j
f w

 (1)
where jw is the weight between the j-th RGAF and output; p is the number of RGAFs, and the
RGAF is denoted as
2( )
j e   , j=1, ..., p. Thus, the output vector of the RGNN can be expressed
as
( , , ) ( )T T NNf x w V w V x , (2)
where 1 2
T p
pw w w   w ;  1 2 T nnx x x x , and. It has been proven that
the RGNN can approximate any continuous function over a compact set  to arbitrary any
accuracy [17, i.e., there exists an ideal RGNN, ( )T T NNw V x , with ideal parameters V and w
such that sup ( ) ( )T T NNf b  x x w V x  . Therefore, ( )d x can be represented as
( ) ( )T T NN ff  x w V x , (3)
where f b  . In this paper, all norms of vectors and matrices adopt Frobenius norm. The
norms of the ideal parameters should satisfy the following assumption.
Assumption 1: The norms of ideal weights are bounded by positive real values, i.e., wMw ,
and VMV . The input is also bounded by NN xbx .
The ideal vectors and matrix are used for analytical purposes, and therefore, it is necessary
to obtain an estimate RGNN ˆ ˆˆ ( )T T NNf w V x to estimate the ideal output of the RGNN. The
weight updating law will be stated in the following section.
2.2. Terminal sliding surface
The terminal sliding surface is defined as
q
ps e e  , (4)
where e is the error variable; is a positive design constant, and p>q>0 are positive odd
integers [9]. The terminal sliding mode control is to develop a control law to reach the surface
s=0 such that e=0 becomes terminal attractor according to 0
q
pe e  [11]. For preventing
from e , a new terminal sliding surface is expressed as
| | sgn( )s e e e   , (5)
where 1 0  and
1, 0
sgn( ) 0, 0
1, 0
e
e e
e

 
 
. Correspondingly, a new form of terminal attractor
can be written as | | sgn( ) 0e e e   .
If the control law can force the surface s to reach zero at t=tr, then e=0 becomes terminal
attractor. The effect of terminal attractor will take the state of e from ( ) 0re t  to ( ) 0r se t t 
within finite time ts given by
11 ( )
(1 )s r

. (6)
Furthermore, a faster terminal sliding surface is defined as | | sgn( )s e e e e     with
5in detail.
3.1. Controller structure
In order to apply the terminal sliding mode control, it is necessary to define the non-singular
terminal sliding surface s(t) for an induction motor as [13]
( )s e sig e    , (12)
where ( ) ( ) ( )r rde t t t   , rd is the desired rotor trajectory of induction motor, and 1 2  .
Next, we can obtain the time derivative of s(t) as
1| |s e e e     , (13)
which is non-singular due to 1 2  . Rewriting (11), the e is given by
* ( , , )e r r rd Le f     (14)
where the nonlinear function ( , , )r r rdf  is defined as
( , , ) (1 )r r rd rd r r Lf J B            . (15)
If ( , , )r r rdf  can be known exactly, then the TSM control law can be developed as [10].
However, since the variations of motor parameters as rotor time constant, unmodelled dynamics
and unstructured dynamics in transient state, the nonlinear function ( , , )r r rdf  becomes
unknown so that the proposed RGNN-based TSM control scheme employs an RGNN to
approximate the unknown function ( , , )r r rdf  and therefore a robust term is necessary to
suppress the approximation error and uncertainties. Thus, the control law is given by
* 21ˆ ˆ( )e f sig e d

    , (16)
where ˆ ˆˆ ( , ( ))Tf tw V x ( ( ) [ ]Tr r rdt     x ) and dˆ is the robust control given in (24). It
should be noted that the control law (16) is non-singular according to 1 2  . Thus,
substituting (14) and control law (16) into (13), the closed-loop dynamics can be expressed by
1 ˆ| | ( )Ls e f d
     (17)
where the approximation error fis given by
ˆ ˆˆ( ) ( )T T T TNN NN ff f f      w V x w V x  . (18)
Assumption 3: The approximation error vector between f and the ideal RGNN,
( )T Tf NNf w V x , is bounded by f b  .
For simplifying the notation, (18) can be expressed by
ˆˆT T ff    w w 
ˆT T
f  w w 
ˆ ˆT T T f     w w w   (19)
with ˆ w w w and ˆ   . Using the Taylor-series expansion to transform the nonlinear
RGAFs into linear parameterized form [17, 18], Lyapunov theorem can be applied to design the
updating law of all parameters of the RGNN. Expand the  in a Taylor series as
  2ˆ T TNN NN   V x O V x  (20)
where ˆ V V V ; 1 2ˆ ˆˆ ˆ{ , , , }pdiag      , and   2T NNO V x is a vector of higher order terms
According to (20), the boundedness of   2T NNO V x is given by
  2 ˆT NN NN  O V x V x  1 2 ˆ NNc c  V x , (21)
where 1c and 2c are constants. Now, substituting (20) into (19) yields
ˆ ˆˆ ˆT T TL L f Lf f           w w w  
7(iii) The terminal sliding surface s(t) will approach zero within finite time.

Differentiating both sides of (31) with (25) yields
   ˆ 0 ˆ ˆˆˆ1 T Tw w NNL k s I   w w V x  . (29)
If  ˆ wMw or   0ˆ ˆˆˆ ˆand 0T Tw NNM s  w w V x  , then we can get
 ˆ 0 ˆ ˆˆˆ 0T Tw NNL k s   w w V x  . (30)
If   0 ˆ ˆˆˆ ˆand 0T Tw NNM s   w w V x  , then the following inequality holds
ˆ 0L w . (31)
Thus, wM is a positive constant that bounds wˆ , i.e., ˆ wMw . Similarly, the boundedness
of jˆv and dˆk can be proved.

Hence, 0L for all t0, and if s(t), jˆv , wˆ and dk are bounded at initial time t=0, they will
remain bounded for all t0. According to bounded e(0) and s(0), e(t) and s(t) are bounded for all

k , jck (j=1,…, 20), and k were chosen as 0.1, 1.4, 50, 10, 10, and 20, respectively.
The first experiment is to track a periodic pulse signal. For generating a smooth reference
trajectory, a second-order transfer function 2 22530 225s s  is chosen as the reference model. The
amplitude and period of the periodic pulse of the reference input are 45
 rad and 2 seconds,
respectively. The desired trajectory of the second experiment is a sinusoidal signal of period 4
seconds with amplitude 2rad. From Figs. 2 and 4, it can be observed that the tracking error of
the proposed RBFNN-based CNTSM control is more accurate than that of the PI control and the
WGNN sliding control. Figs. 3 and 5 show that the WGNN sliding control has fast oscillatory
torque command and the proposed RGNN-based CNTSM control has large control effort to
reduce the tracking error at the beginning. Therefore, these experimental results confirm that the
proposed controller can obtain high precision control as expectation.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, a continuous non-singular terminal sliding mode control system has been proposed
to control an induction motor to achieve high-precision position tracking performance. The
controller employs a ridge Gaussian neural network (RGNN) to approximate nonlinear functions
of the induction motor. The signals in the closed loop are all guaranteed to be bounded and the
position of the rotor is both proved to follow the desired trajectory in finite time. Moreover, all
parameters of the RGNN can be tuned on-line within the specified bounds to preserve the
localized learning capability by projection update rules. Experimental results show that the
RGNN controller with continuous non-singular terminal sliding mode possesses the accurate and
fast tracking capability.
