Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been used widely to induce gene silencing in cells. To predict the efficacy of an siRNA with
respect to inhibition of its target mRNA, we developed a two layer system, siPRED, which is based on various characteristic
methods in the first layer and fusion mechanisms in the second layer. Characteristic methods were constructed by support
vector regression from three categories of characteristics, namely sequence, features, and rules. Fusion mechanisms
considered combinations of characteristic methods in different categories and were implemented by support vector
regression and neural networks to yield integrated methods. In siPRED, the prediction of siRNA efficacy through integrated
methods was better than through any method that utilized only a single method. Moreover, the weighting of each
characteristic method in the context of integrated methods was established by genetic algorithms so that the effect of each
characteristic method could be revealed. Using a validation dataset, siPRED performed better than other predictive systems
that used the scoring method, neural networks, or linear regression. Finally, siPRED can be improved to achieve a correlation
coefficient of 0.777 when the threshold of the whole stacking energy is $234.6 kcal/mol. siPRED is freely available on the
web at http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/siPRED.

Introduction
It is now well established that the translation of a target mRNA
can be inhibited by a small interfering RNA (siRNA). This
technique, called RNA interference (RNAi), was initially described
as post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by double-stranded
RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans [1]. RNAi can now be used to
specifically suppress the expression of essentially any gene of
interest. Because the siRNA is an important factor for triggering
RNAi, the effectiveness of RNAi can be increased by improving
the efficacy of the siRNA. In the RNAi pathway, double-stranded
RNA is cleaved to yield a short, double-stranded fragment, i.e., an
siRNA, by the ribonuclease III–like enzyme Dicer. Then the guide
strand of the siRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced
silencing complex, which recognizes the sequence of the target
mRNA by hybridization between the guide strand of siRNA and
its complementary region in the target mRNA. The silencing
complex then mediates the cleavage of the target mRNA to yield
short fragments [2–4]. siRNAs of 19 nucleotides in length with 2-
nucleotide 39 overhangs are generally used for gene silencing [5].
Methods to predict the efficacy of an siRNA can be derived by
analyzing various characteristics in siRNA datasets. Therefore,
selecting those characteristics is crucial. We divided such
predictive methods into three characteristic categories. (i) Se-
quence characteristics, which is based on the nucleotides as the
input of the predictive system. In this case, the individual
nucleotides in the sequence are transformed into numerical
representations that are then used as the inputs for constructing
an efficacy prediction model [6–8]. Moreover, the frequency of
each nucleotide at a specific position is analyzed by statistical
methods in a dataset, and then the conditional probability model is
used to find an optimal siRNA [9]. (ii) Feature characteristics,
which uses many features to predict the efficacy of an siRNA by
analyzing various properties. Nucleotide composition and the
stability of an siRNA or mRNA are analyzed, and then the
significant features are selected to build prediction models [10–14].
(iii) Rule characteristics, from which the significant rules are
generalized from datasets. The rules can be a basis for selecting
effective siRNAs [15–17].
Many systems that predict siRNA efficacy have adopted a
dataset comprised of mature siRNAs, i.e., the Novartis dataset, for
analysis and construction. Ichihara et al. [18] developed the scoring
method, i-Score, which generates a score for each nucleotide by
linear regression, and then siRNA efficacy is predicted by
summarizing the score. Further, the tools Biopredsi [19], Thermo-
Composition21 [12], and DSIR [13] have also adopted the Novartis
dataset to evolve predictive systems. Biopredsi applies an artificial
neural network (NN) model, which yielded a high correlation
coefficient of 0.66 between the observed and predicted siRNA
efficacy. Because the parameters of Biopredsi are not demonstrated,
however, Ichihara et al. [18] developed s-Biopredsi, which is similar
to Biopredsi, and got a high correlation coefficient in predicted

perhaps owing to the possibility that the feature elements of F162
were relatively more compatible with dataset A. The integrated
method Hybrid+F65 showed the best correlation coefficient by
using SVR or NN, yielding r values of 0.588 and 0.586,
respectively, with dataset B. Therefore, Hybrid+F65 with SVR is
the major contributor to the results generated in the second layer.
However, the performance was poor for the training of the single
method F65 and each of F65+Hybrid and F65+Binary with
dataset A, but F65+Hybrid and F65+Binary performed well in the
validation with dataset B. Thus, validation with dataset B is
important for selecting suitable feature elements.
Although Hybrid+F65 had a high ability to predict siRNA
efficacy, the impact of each characteristic method in fusion
mechanism with SVR or NN cannot be evaluated. Thus, the
contribution (i.e., weight) of each characteristic method in
Hybrid+F65 was evolved by genetic algorithms. The fitness
function as the mean square error is:
1=n
Xn
i~1
Robserved,i{Rpredicted,i
 2
;
where i is the i-th siRNA in dataset A, Robserved,i is the observed i-th
siRNA efficacy, and Rpredicted,i is the predicted i-th siRNA efficacy.
Further, Rpredicted is calculated as:
Rpredicted~WHybrid|RHybridzWF65|RF65;
where RHybrid and RF65 are predicted outputs of the characteristic
methods of Hybrid and F65, respectively, and WHybrd and WF65
are the evolved weights of Hybrid and F65, respectively. The
distribution of weights in Hybrid+F65 is evident from this fitness
function. Table 4 shows a steady trend of increasing r with the
progression of generations of the training of genetic algorithms
with dataset A. Furthermore, the best weights were obtained
through the validation of dataset B, and a correlation coefficient of
0.57 was achieved at generation 2000. Although this coefficient
was not better than that achieved with SVR or NN in training and
validation, the role of Hybrid or F65 played in the integrated
method could be realized. The results for WF65 thus demonstrated
that the feature characteristic method is significant for predicting
siRNA efficacy.
Comparison of algorithms
To validate siPRED and compare it with other systems, i.e., i-Score, s-
Biopredsi, ThermoComposition21, and DSIR, with respect to predicting
siRNA efficacy in dataset B, we obtained the results for these other
systems from Ichihara et al. [18] (Figure 1). siPRED yielded a high
correlation coefficient for siRNA efficacy in dataset B, which was better
than that obtained with the other systems. s-Biopredsi, i-Score, and DSIR
yielded similar correlation coefficients, namely 0.546, 0.557, and 0.554,
respectively. ThermoComposition21 and siPRED yielded higher (and
similar) correlation coefficients of 0.577 and 0.588, respectively.
siPRED and ThermoComposition21 based on linear regression showed
that they had better performance compared with DSIR as well as s-
Biopredsi using NN and i-Score using the scoring method.
In addition, Accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and
the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were used to evaluate
the predictive ability of each system. Four measures were defined:

siPRED
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e27602
DG$234.6 kcal/mol totaled 101 siRNAs. Using this set, siPRED
yielded the highest correlation coefficient (r=0.777), and the r for
i-Score actually improved from 0.557 to 0.723; this was also the
case for the other systems, especially s-Biopredsi and DSIR, for
which r increased from 0.546 to 0.724 and from 0.554 to 0.733,
respectively. The set comprising siRNAs with DG,234.6 kcal/
mol totaled 318 siRNAs; when this set was used, s-Biopredsi and
DSIR had an r of ,0.5, whereas siPRED, i-Score, and Thermo-
Composition21 had an r of .0.5. Furthermore, the r of siPRED
(0.538) was slightly less than that of ThermoComposition21 (0.551).
Thus, the accuracy of siPRED could be further enhanced by
improving the analysis of the whole DG.
Discussion
A high correlation coefficient for predicting siRNA efficacy can
be achieved by combining characteristic methods with fusion
mechanisms. In the first layer of siPRED, however, it is very
important to select appropriate feature elements. The feature
characteristic method F162, in which feature elements were
significant (p-value,0.001) but did not further select elements of
high correlation, had the worst performance (Table 2). Therefore,
we assumed that the feature elements of higher correlation could
increase the training ability of each feature characteristic method.
Although this was indeed the case, especially for F85 for which the
correlation coefficient increased by 5.3%, selecting feature
elements of higher correlation for F47 increased the correlation
coefficient by only 2.1%. Because F47 and F162 gave similar
results, our assumption is imperfect. If feature elements are not
correctly selected, it is possible that there is a fault in the system
that lowers the correlation coefficient of the predictive system.
Consequently, the best strategy is to eliminate feature elements of
low correlation by conducting an analysis based on a correlation
threshold in the first layer.
Based on the values of the various correlation coefficients of all
the characteristic methods in the second layer (Table S1), high
correlations were found among each method for predicting siRNA
efficacy, with the exception of F162. The highest correlation
coefficient for F162 was achieved between the predicted and
observed efficacy (r=0.782). This could cause the integrated
methods, including F162, to yield a high correlation coefficient
during training with dataset A, although the worst performance in
validation was with dataset B. This phenomenon is caused by
overfitting because F162 has too many feature elements.
Furthermore, F162 has a higher correlation coefficient with F85
compared with the other characteristic methods. This observation
reveals that the predicted efficacy of F85 is similar to that of F162
and that F85 is also likely to incur a certain degree of overfitting.
For this reason, integrated methods, including F85, did not
perform best with dataset B in fusion mechanisms. Thus, the best
method for use in siPRED is Hybrid+F65.
Additionally, thermodynamic parameters were notably impor-
tant in the study of Ichihara et al. [18] and Lu et al. [14]; in
particular, Lu et al. considered many kinds of thermodynamic
parameters to select effective siRNAs. Therefore, we also adopted
thermodynamic parameters even through n-grams had provided
above 50% feature elements in feature characteristic methods.
Even so, Sp in our study did not have the best performance
compared with other predictive systems, and siPRED might be
improved by considering more thermodynamic parameters.
We have created a freely available web tool for siPRED (http://
predictor.nchu.edu.tw/siPRED). The input of the siPRED server is
the sequence of the target mRNA. The nucleotides of A, U/T, C
and G are acceptable in the input sequence, and the threshold
setting of siRNA efficacy is also provided. Upon completion of the
predictive processing, the results are presented in three parts. One
part shows all candidate siRNAs above the threshold, and the
other parts are used with the whole DG to divide the candidate
siRNAs into two sets. The first set contains candidate siRNAs of
high predictive accuracy as determined by siPRED, and the second
set contains a little siRNAs of high efficacy, but the predictive
accuracy in the second set is lower than that in the first set. We
suggest selecting the first set, which contains candidate siRNAs
having a DG$234.6 kcal/mol.
Materials and Methods
Datasets
Two siRNA datasets were used to construct and validate
siPRED for predicting siRNA efficacy. Dataset A, consisting of
2431 siRNAs that Husken et al. [19] verified by experiment, was
the foundation for establishing siPRED. Dataset B, a testing
dataset, was mutually exclusive with dataset A, and it was used to
validate the predictive systems. Dataset B consisted of 419 siRNAs
that Ichihara et al. [18] gathered from five reports that each
reported a small num-ber of siRNAs [5,17,20–22]. Because
dataset B differed from dataset A, it was used to estimate the
accuracy of the prediction systems.
Three categories of characteristic methods
Sequence characteristics. The first category includes
numeric, binary, and hybrid encoding characteristic methods.
Numeric encoding is applied to the nucleotides A, U, C and G,
each of which is assigned a number 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
Binary encoding is A= 0 0 0 1, U= 0 0 1 0, C= 0 1 0 0 and G=1
