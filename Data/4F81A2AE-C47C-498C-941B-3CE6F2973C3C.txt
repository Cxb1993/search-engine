Additional contact-mode scanning probe
electrical-field-induced chemical bond decom-
position patterning was carried out to obtain de-
sired patterns under ambient conditions (tip
drawing speed = 0.5 m/s, set point = -1.032 nN,
temperature = 260.5 ºC, relative humidity = 60
1%) on the aminosilane-modified surface of
the SiNWs by applying 6 V between the
PtIr-coated conductive AFM tip and the modified
surface. After the SPL chemical bond decom-
position, the bond-breaking patterned SiNW de-
vice was immersed in the citrate-coated AuNP
solution for 90 min, then rinsed with deionized
water and dried with nitrogen gas (N2). This
process ensured that the negatively charged 15
nm AuNPs were selectively anchored on the un-
exposed SPL region, which provided a surface
bearing free amines (-NH2). The affinity of the
surface bearing free amines for gold can cause
the AuNPs to be immobilized on the si-
lane-coupler-treated SiNW device via Coulombic
electrostatic attractions.
We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS; spatial resolution = 100 nm) to demon-
strate the surface chemical composition of 15 nm
AuNPs selectively anchored on the SiO2 surface,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM;
JOEL-7000) to characterize the selective deposi-
tion of 15-nm-citrate-coated AuNPs on the SPL
unexposed region, and a semiconductor parame-
ter analyzer to measure the photoconductivity
characteristics of p-type SiNW devices with se-
lectively anchored AuNPs.
3. Results and Discussions
Our research team successfully controlled and
demonstrated a straightforward SPL
field-induced bond breaking for the patternwise
placement of AuNPs with nanometer resolution
on the thin SiO2 surface. Figure 2 shows the
high-resolution XPS survey analysis both inside
and outside SPL bond breaking patterns on the
SiO2 surface after the self-assembly of cit-
rate-passivated AuNPs. In this study, the bias
for SPL bond breaking is 6 V. The peak signal
of Au 4f corresponds to the 15 nm AuNPs in the
area outside the SPL bond breaking patterns on
the aminosilane modified SiO2 surface. There is
no gold peak signal in the SPL bond breaking
patterns on the modified SiO2 surface. This re-
sult shows that citrate-passivated AuNPs were
selectively deposited on the unexposed SPL sur-
rounding areas. Figure 2 shows that the 15 nm
negatively charged AuNPs were anchored only
on the AEAPTMS areas unexposed to SPL after
immersion in the AuNP solution for 90 min.
Therefore, the proposed technique provides an
easy method and very reliable selectivity for an-
choring AuNPs at nanometer-scale resolution.

Figure 3. Analysis of electrical properties
(IDS-VDS) of a silicon nanowire device with
chemical modifications at room temperature (300
K). The conductance of p-type SiNW devices
was modulated as a result of the chemical modi-
fications to the device channel surface due to
changes in the chemical potential after surface
modification.
On the nanometer scale, owing to the in-
creased surface-to-volume ratio, surface state ef-
fects become very sensitive and predominant and
can significantly modify properties. Devices
based on SiNWs are emerging as powerful tools
for biosensing that enable the direct sensing of
electron variations on the channel surfaces of
AuNPs. Figure 5 shows a wavelength depend-
ent photoresponse resistance. The photoconduc-
tivity behavior of the SiNW device was enhanced
by the effect of surface plasmon resonance at 520
nm. Another enhancement of SiNW conductance
occurred at 720 nm due to an SPR effect between
the illumination -on and -off conditions. Such
enhancement resulted from an SPR effect due to
aggregation of AuNP clusters on the SiNW
channel surface.
Furthermore, owing to the surface state
potential of p-channels of SiNW devices
was modulated by chemicals of different
electric charge polarities and can be de-
tected with very high sensitivity. The sili-
con nanowires (SiNWs) have been used as a
sensing layer in a field-effect transistor for the
measurement of solution pH as shown in the Fig-
ure 6. The high sensitivity is about 97.94
nS/ pH. We have demonstrated that the SPL
bond breaking technique provides a pathway for
surface modification to link different functional
groups and enable diverse applications in the
fields of biosensing and nanotechnology. These
assemblies represent a robust and versatile plat-
form for building a new generation of highly
specific biosensors and nano/bioelectronic de-
vices.

4. Conclusions
In this research, we have successfully dem-
onstrated the photoresponse of a Si-nanowire
with Au nanodots by the self-assembled
monolayer formation technique. We demonstrate
a new approach for the patternwise deposition of
AuNPs onto SiO2 surfaces with nanometer-scale
resolution by SPL field-induced decomposition of
AEAPTMS SAMs. XPS spectra shows the
cleanness of the selectivity of deposition of
AuNPs. The surface state potential of p-channels
of SiNW devices was modulated by chemicals of
different electric charge polarities and can be de-
tected with very high sensitivity. The high sen-
sitivity pH sensor is about 97.94 nS/ pH.
The photoconductivity responses were
measured as a function of wavelength of light
illumination for the p-channel surface of SiNWs
with a few selectively deposited AuNPs. The
photoconductivity behavior was enhanced at a
surface plasmon resonance wavelength of 520 nm
at room temperature. Another enhancement of
photoconductivity at a wavelength of 720 nm
may be due to the effect of SPR on AuNP clusters.
The proposed technique can be widely applied to
chemical nanobiosensors and nanoelectronics.

1. Introduction
LEDs, following laser and intense pulsed light (IPL), have
become the new favorite in the ﬁeld of medical treatment and
phototherapy. Today, LEDs not only thrive in the ﬁeld of low
intensity photo rejuvenation; but are also used for the treatments
of rhinitis, arthritis, jaundice, joint/tissue inﬂammation, skin
abnormality, and for the relief of stress, seasonal affective disorder,
as well as biological clock disorders.
LEDs are solid-state semiconductor devices which contain a
single p–n junction, that is, the junction of a p-type layer where the
carriers are positively charged holes and an n-type layer in which
current is carried by mobile electrons.
LEDs pass an electrical current in the direction where electrons
move from the n-region to the p-region. The electrons then
recombine with holes to generate photons of light. The light
emitted by a LED is usually in a narrow band of wavelength
corresponding to the energy associated with electron–hole pair
recombination. That energy is approximately the band gap energy
of the semiconductor in which the recombination occurs.
As the performance of LED continues to improve ever since
1980s, these lighting systems progress from red-only LED arrays to
high density, multi-color LED chip-on-board technologies. After
the development of blue–green LEDs based on aluminum gallium
indium nitride (AlGaInN) in the early 1990s, low-voltage light
sources in all three primary colors (red, green and blue) have
become available for the lighting and display industries. This
development has also helped to penetrate multi-billion dollar
markets in indoor agricultural production as well as medical
treatment and phototherapy.

The rapid development of high brightness light-emitting diodes (LEDs) makes feasible the use of LEDs,
among other light sources (such as laser, intense pulse light and other incoherent light systems), for
medical treatment and light therapy. This paper provides a general review on red, green, blue, ultraviolet
LED applications in photo rejuvenation and medical treatments of a variety of physical abnormalities, as
well as the relief of stress, circadian rhythm disorders, and seasonal affective disorder. The review,
concentrated in the papers published after 1990, intends to show that LEDs are well qualiﬁed to succeed
its more energy demanding counterparts in the named areas and beyond.

Trelles and Allone [10] have studied 10 subjects regarding the
effects of a LED phototherapy system on enhancing wound healing
following the combination of eyelid surgery and laser ablative
resurfacing. After the surgery, one-half of each subject’s face was
treated with the red LED therapy (20 min, 96 J/cm2, 633 nm), the
other half of each subject’s face being the un-irradiated control.
Erythema, edema, bruising, and days to healing were indepen-
dently evaluated from the clinical photography. The 633 nm LED
therapy-treated side is superior to the un-irradiated control by a
factor of two to three in all instances.
Agnol et al. [11] have compared the wound healing effect of
lights using LED and laser. They have established surgical dorsum
lesions on 36 rats. For those subjects that have been irradiated once
with LED (640 with 40 nm full bandwidth at half maximum) or
laser (660 nm) 30 min after the establishment of the lesion, the
researchers have found that the two light sources produced similar
effects during a period of 168 h after the establishment of the
lesion. For the group consisting of diabetic animals, 72 h after
creation of the lesion, the therapy with LEDs had been more
efﬁcient than that with the laser in wound reduction.
The results of all these researches indicate that LED, a more
economical low density light source, is a great alternative to laser
for LLLT.
2.3. Treatment of acne vulgaris
Sun exposure has a beneﬁcial effect on acne vulgaris
(commonly called acne) but how wavelengths of the sun
contribute to such effect is not clear. Lights in red, blue, green,
violet, and ultraviolet segments have all been reported to be
effective for the treatment of acne. The following researches have
been conducted to deﬁne the most effective wavelengths.
Sigurdsson et al. [12] have treated 30 patients with mild to
moderate facial, back, or chest acne vulgaris using three (full
spectrum, green, and violet) light sources. Each patient receives a
20-min session light treatment three times aweek for 7weeks. The
results show that the improvements by full spectrum, green, and
violet are 14%, 22%, and 30%, respectively. While it seems that
violet light is better than the other light qualities, the improve-
ments induced by the three light sources have shown no
statistically signiﬁcant difference.
Papageorgiou et al. [13] have evaluated the effectiveness of blue
light (peak at 415 nm) and amixed blue and red light (peaks at 415
and 660 nm) in acne treatments. Their study randomly assigned
107 patients with mild to moderate acne in four treatment groups
to be treated with blue light, mixed blue and red light, cool white
light, and 5% benzoyl peroxide cream, respectively. Subjects in the
phototherapy groups received irradiation 15 min daily from
portable light sources. After 12 weeks of active treatment, the
combined blue–red light group achieved a mean improvement of
76% in inﬂammatory lesions, signiﬁcantly superior to that in all
other groups. The ﬁnal mean improvement by using blue–red light
is 58%, still better than that in the other groups.
Although the acne treatment studies above have not indicated
the light source used for their researches, yet there should be no
signiﬁcant down effect if the laser or any other light source in the
treatment device is replaced with LEDs of the same frequencies
according to the study of Lee et al. [14] These researchers have
investigated the effectiveness of combined blue and red LEDs
phototherapy for acne. They treated 24 patients with mild to
moderate facial acne with alternating blue (415 nm) and red
(633 nm) LED devices twice a week for 4 weeks. The study results
indicate that the percentage improvements in non-inﬂammatory
and inﬂammatory lesions have been 34.28% and 77.93%, respec-
tively. Fourteen patients have reported brightened skin tone and
improved skin texture. These studies basically conclude that
phototherapy with mixed blue–red light, probably by combining
antibacterial and anti-inﬂammatory action, is a safe, effective, and
non-painful treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris, with no
signiﬁcant short-term adverse effects.
2.4. Photo rejuvenation
Over time, skin gradually displays the effects of aging. The
collagen in the skin begins to break down and results in ﬁne lines
and then deeper grooves on the skin surface. Factors like sun,
gravity, and hormones can speed up the aging process. The
treatment of aging skin has always been a very popular topic.
People who have skin conditions like ﬂushed faces, sun-damaged
skin, hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores may seek for the help of
cosmetic surgery procedures, including photo rejuvenation.
Increasing insight into the overlap between UV-induced skin
cancer and UV-induced skin aging has contributed to the
development of photoaging research. And market pressures have
made photoaging research a prevailing ﬁeld in investigative
dermatology.
Both ablative and non-ablative resurfacing have been reported
as solutions to intrinsic and photoaging and as being able to
generate a younger dermal matrix. Non-ablative lasers and the IPL
systems are aimed to avoid the undesirable development (such as
pain, bruising, and redness) following laser ablative resurfacing,
but these systems are still quite expensive and therapist-intensive.
As a result the patient responses have been unsatisfactory.
Trelles et al. [15] suggest that no single modality can
accomplish all the complex events required for effective skin
rejuvenation. The combination phototherapy that uses different
modalities in various combinations at sub-ablative thresholds
should have better results. Therefore, the entry of blue and infrared
tunable plasma light and LEDs into the skin rejuvenation arena has
attracted attention.Lubart et al. [16] propose a photo rejuvenation
mechanism based on light-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)
formation. They irradiate collagen in vitro with a broadband of
visible light (400–800 nm, 24–72 J/cm2) and have found that the
irradiated collagen results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals.
These researchers suggest that visible light at the energy doses
used for skin rejuvenation (20–30 J/cm2) produces high amounts of
ROS, which destroy old collagen ﬁbers, encouraging the formation
of new ones. While at inner depths of the skin, where the light
intensity is much weaker, low amounts of ROS are formed, which
are well known to stimulate ﬁbroblast production.
Trelles [17] have suggested that LED therapy represents a
potential approach in anti-aging prevention. He has proposed to
apply prevention to subjects in their very early 20 s before the
appearance of ﬁne lines. The prevention can be achieved via
irradiating low level photo energy with speciﬁc wavelengths that,
based on the photobiological ﬁndings, can stimulate both
epidermal and dermal cells. He has also reported that the LEDs
from the NASA Space Medicine Program can enhance action
potentials of the skin cells and increases in local blood and
lymphatic ﬂow in a non-invasive, athermalmanner. His conclusion
is that LED-based systems can be less-expensive but clinically
useful light source against photoaging.
3. Other biomedical applications
LED-based biomedical systems are also proved to be effective in
the areas, which are described as follows:
Actinic keratosis: Actinic keratosis (AK), or solar keratosis, is a
precancerous condition of thick, scaly, or crusty patches of skin
associated with those who are frequently exposed to the sun.
Babilas et al. [18] have conducted a controlled split-face study to
evaluate the LED-based photodynamic therapy (PDT). They have

quintupling DNA synthesis in ﬁbroblasts and muscle cells in one
application using the combination of 680, 730 and 880 nm LED.
4. Conclusion
Besides being used for the treatments of rhinitis, arthritis,
jaundice, etc. LEDs are used for the relief of stress, seasonal
affective disorder, and biological clock disorders; not to mention
that LEDs are thriving in the ﬁeld of low intensity photo
rejuvenation. The LED-based PDT has even been expanded to
cancer treatments [30].
LEDs allow the adjustment of light intensity. They have the
ability to produce high light levels with low radiant heat output
and maintain useful light output for years. LED-based systems can
provide a homogenous light dose in optimal intensity.While lasers
provide tissue stimulations which increase cellular activity during
wound healing, they have limitation in wavelengths. It is difﬁcult
for lasers to produce the efﬁcient wavelength combination optimal
for wound healing. The size of wounds that may be treated by the
small beam width of laser is also limited. In contrast, LEDs allow
the control of spectral composition and can be arranged in ﬂat
arrays of all sizes for the treatment of small or large areas. LEDs
offer an effective alternative to conventional light sources also for
the following reasons:
1. Using LED array light source for medical devices is much more
economical than using IPL or laser sources. LEDs are highly
durable and thus are less-expensive in the long term. Their
compact and light design and the resulting lower weight make
the use of LED systems simpler.
2. Solid-state high efﬁciency LED is safer to use than the traditional
gas laser. The energy level of LED is low. When used in medical
treatment, LED-based systems do not need a high voltage power
supply as required in laser-based ones. When required, LED-
based devices are more easily to be made self-contained. They
can be continuously operated with a battery pack for a longer
period. For any medical treatment equipment, especially those
used in the remote areas where no modern utilities are readily
available, this is an attractive feature.
3. While many of the wavelength segments are not yet available in
semiconductor laser, wavelengths generated from LEDs have
covered partial ultraviolet, near infrared, and almost all the
visible bands.
4. LEDs produce less heat than high-pressure lamps and thus the
hyperthermic effects that can be induced by high-intensity light
sources are avoided. As a result, LEDs can be placed in a closer
range from the treatment areas than other light sources so there
will be less distance to diminish the intensity required. This
accounts for more energy saving.
5. Their relatively narrow emission spectrum of LED systems can
be optimally tuned so as to correspond to the treatment
requirement and thus eliminates wavelengths not needed for
the therapy. As a result, the irradiation time required for
treatment is much shorter than with incoherent light sources.
The studies reviewed in this paper indicate that LEDs have
opened up new prospects as an effective light source of
phototherapy and medical treatment as they have in indoor
agriculture. One thing noteworthy is that the wavelengths proved
to be effective are centralized in red, blue, and infrared segments
(see Table 1) for both agricultural production and medical
treatment. It is safe to say that the researches about the biomedical
effect of other wavelengths (i.e. orange, yellow, and green) may
lead to additional discoveries.
As the LED-manufacturing related patents issued since 1990
will expire starting from 2010 [31], LED-manufacturers who hold
patents may expand their license deals with other companies to
make full use of those patents before the expiration date. These
manufacturers may also develop new patent technology to
produce new products that can boost the LED industry. All these
lead to lower LED costs and more LED varieties. Therefore, LED-
based applications, along with phototherapy, are setting out for a
superior outlook in the years to come as LED becomes more
qualiﬁed to replace its more energy demanding counterparts.
