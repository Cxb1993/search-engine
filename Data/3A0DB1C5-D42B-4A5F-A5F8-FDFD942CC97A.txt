Abstract 
 This report reviews the performance on 
the project NSC98-2221-E-002-015-MY3, 
Epitaxial Growth of High-Indium and 
High-Aluminum-Content GaN-Based 
Semiconductors for Energy Optoelectronic 
Device Applications – sub-plan-2: 
Comprehensive Analyses and Penetrating 
Investigation on high-indium and 
high-aluminum GaN-compound materials 
epitaxied from pulse laser deposition, for the 
3rd year of 8/1/2011 – 10/31/2012. In this 
period, P.I. (and collaborators as well as 
students) have published 2-volume 
Handbooks for ZnO and Related materials 
[1-2], 18 journal papers [3-20] including 
11-listed in SCI [3-7,13-18] and 7 in E.I. 
[8-12,19,20], 1 book chapter [21], and 10 
international conference papers [22-31] as 
well as 15 domestic conference/proceeding 
papers [32-46], plus 1 keynote lecture [47] 
and 1 plenary speech [48]. Main key 
significant results and achievements include: 
A) Authorized review handbooks of ZnO and 
related materials, devices and engineering 
[1,2], B) Infrared reflectance and 
transmission spectra in II-VI alloys and 
superlattices [3], C) Tetragonal distortion of 
InAsPSb film grown on InAs substrate 
studied by Rutherford backscattering/ 
channeling and synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
[5], D) Raman scattering and Rutherford 
backscattering studies on InN films grown by 
plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy [6], 
E) Shallow–Deep InGaN Multiple-Quantum- 
Well System for Dual-Wavelength Emission 
Grown on Semipolar (112¯2) Facet GaN [7], 
F) Vibrational signatures of isotopic 
impurities and complexes in II-VI compound 
semiconductors [13], G) Investigation of 
 4 
and communications to biotechnology, 
imaging, and medicine. With an emphasis on 
engineering and materials science, Handbook 
of Zinc Oxide and Related Materials 
provides a comprehensive, up-to-date review 
of various technological aspects of ZnO. 
 The two volumes in this handbook 
deliver an invaluable, cohesive source of 
information for material growers and 
evaluators, device design and processing 
engineers, and users and researchers of 
ZnO-based technologies. Each chapter is 
written by experts in the field who discuss the 
significant advances made in recent years, 
assess the progress made by different research 
groups, and offer suggestions for further 
work. The first volume presents fundamental 
knowledge on ZnO-based materials and 
technologies while the second focuses on 
devices and nanostructures created from ZnO 
and similar materials.  
 Covering key properties and important 
technologies of ZnO-based materials, devices 
and nanoengineering, the handbook highlights 
the potential of this wide gap semiconductor. 
The book covers various nanostructures, 
synthesis/creation strategies, device behavior, 
and state-of-the-art applications in electronics 
and optoelectronics. It also illustrates the 
remaining challenging issues in nanomaterial 
preparation and device fabrication, such as 
LEDs, LDs, photodetectors, and nanodevices, 
for R&D in the twenty-first century. 
 
B) Infrared reflectance and transmission 
spectra in II-VI alloys and superlattices [3] 
 Room temperature measurements of the 
far-infrared (FIR) reflectance spectra are 
reported for the polar optical phonons in a 
series of bulk CdxZn1-xTe (0<x<1) and 
CdSexTe1-x (0<x<0.35) crystals grown by 
Bridgman technique. The composition- 
dependent spectra exhibited many 
fundamental aspects of lattice vibrations, 
while the results of long-wavelength optical 
modes for the end member binary compounds 
displayed phonon values in good agreement 
with the existing inelastic neutron scattering 
and/or Raman spectroscopy data. Using a 
standard methodology of multilayer optics 
with effective-medium dielectric tensors, we 
simulated the FIR transmission and 
reflectivity spectra at oblique incidence 
(Berreman’s effect) in many II-VI 
free-standing thin films, epilayers and 
superlattices. Berreman’s approach provided 
us with a strong basis for analyzing the 
infrared experimental data and offered an 
effective means of estimating the zone-center 
transverse and longitudinal optical (ω TO, ω
LO) phonon frequencies in 
polar-semiconductor thin films and 
heterostructure materials of increasing 
technological importance. 
 
C) Tetragonal distortion of InAsPSb film 
grown on InAs substrate studied by 
Rutherford backscattering/ channeling and 
synchrotron X-ray diffraction [5]  
 Rutherford backscattering/channeling 
spectrometry and synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction are employed to characterize the 
structural properties of the InAsPSb epilayer 
grown on the InAs substrate. The results 
indicate that a 975-nm thick 
InAs0.668P0.219Sb0.113 layer has a quite good 
crystalline quality (min=6.1%). The 
channeling angular scan around an off-normal 
<111> axis in the (0-11) plane of the sample 
is used to determine the tetragonal distortion 
eT, which is caused by elastic strain in the 
layer. The results show that the InAsPSb 
layer is subjected to an elastic strain at the 
interfacial layer, and the strain decreases 
gradually moving towards the near-surface 
layer. It is expected that an epitaxial InAsPSb 
layer with the thickness of around 1700 nm 
will be fully relaxed (eT=0). The magnitude 
difference of eT deduced from angular scans 
and X-ray diffraction implies some structure 
(like dislocations) may play a role. 
 
D) Raman scattering and Rutherford 
backscattering studies on InN films grown by 
plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy [6] 
 A series of InN thin filmswas grown on 
sapphire substrates via plasma- assisted 
molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) with 
different nitrogen plasma power. Various 
 6 
pairs indicating the passivation of group-I 
acceptors via interaction with group-III 
elements as donors. The proposal of an 
antisite complex model AlZn-ZnSe-AlZn for 
the X center is consistent with the existing 
absorption results on impurity modes and is 
equally justified by theoretical 
considerations—making it the more likely 
identity for the native defect compensating 
neighboring AlZn donors in ZnSe. 
 
G) Investigation of defect-related optical 
properties in AlxInyGa1-x-yN quaternary alloys 
with different Al/In ratios [14]  
 AlxInyGa1-x-yN quaternary alloys with 
different ratios of Al/In were grown by 
metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on 
GaN/Al2O3 substrates. The structural and 
emission properties of the as-grown samples 
were investigated, respectively, by 
high-resolution X-ray diffraction and 
photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The 
PL emission character is related to the two 
prominent quenching bands, which have been 
determined to be located at around 1.1 eV 
and 1.7 eV above the valence band, 
respectively, by the method of optical 
quenching of photoconductivity. PL emission 
is most intense when the Al/In ratio is 7.5 for 
the AlxInyGa1-x-yN layer. In addition, a 
stronger quenching phenomenon with Al/In 
ratio of 5.0 in AlxInyGa1-x-yN is observed in 
accordance with a reduction of the intensity 
of AlxInyGa1-x-yN-related emission peak. 
 
H) Bond lengths and lattice structure of 
InP0.52Sb0.48 grown on GaAs [15]  
 We performed reciprocal space mapping 
(RSM) and extended x-ray absorption fine 
structure (EXAFS) measurements to 
investigate the lattice structure of 
InP0.52Sb0.48 grown on GaAs. The RSM 
data reveal the existence of residual strain in 
the 1-m-thick epilayer. The average vertical 
to horizontal lattice constant ratio, az/axy, is 
1.009. We used a valence force field model to 
calculate the distortion energy and bond 
lengths of InPSb supercells with different 
az/axy ratio. The calculated InP and InSb bond 
lengths are in good agreement with the results 
of EXAFS. Both bond lengths are close to 
those in corresponding end-point binaries. We 
attributed the residual strain to the 
non-vanishing distortion energy resulting 
from the bond length mismatch between InP 
and InSb bonds. 
 
I) Observation of In-related collective 
spontaneous emission (superfluorescence) in 
Cd0.8Zn0.2Te:In crystal [16]  
 In this research, the In-related 
super-fluorescence at 788 nm from 
Cd0.8Zn0.2Te:In single crystal has been 
observed and characterized by the 
time-resolved photoluminescence comparing 
with undoped Cd0.8Zn0.2Te. The peak 
intensity scales  and the emitted pulse 
width scales , where  is the pump 
pulse energy. The emission pulse shows delay 
of 43 ps with respect to the pump pulse and 
has a pulse width of 60 ps corresponding to a 
resolution of the streak camera. The 
observation of super-ﬂuorescence from 
Cd0.8Zn0.2Te:In single crystal extends 
characteristic studies of CdZnTe as one of 
materials for making super-fluorescence 
sources. 
 
J) Raman spectra investigation of InAlGaN 
quaternary alloys grown by metalorganic 
chemical vapor deposition [17]  
 Raman analysis of the A1(LO) mode of 
AlGaN-like phonons of the InAlGaN/GaN 
heterostructures in the composition range 
1.38%<In< 2.73% and 8.01%<Al<13.97% is 
presented. The line shape of A1(LO) mode of 
AlGaN-like phonons was observed to exhibit 
a significant asymmetry and Raman line-width 
toward the lower energy side. The spatial 
correlation model is discussed and is shown 
to account the line shape. The spatial 
correlation model calculations also indicate 
the lack of a long-range order in the higher Al 
to In ratio of InAlGaN/GaN alloys. These 
results were confirmed by x-ray diffraction 
and the correlation length L decreases as the 
increasing of Al to In ratio corresponding to 
the absence of the long-range order in the 
alloy. The Raman line-width of the 
AlGaN-like A1(LO) mode was found to 
 8 
research and training to be able to continue 
the works for next NSC comprehensive 
research project.

廣州-中山大學 and 深圳大學 have professors and students in co-producing these two papers. 
Therefore, they have co-sponsored the expenses for me to attend this important international 
conference in the field of SiC in Russia. 廣州-中山大學 has supported to cover the conference 
registration fee, Russia Visa fee and 廣州-北京 round air-ticket; 深圳大學 has supported the 
air-ticket of 台北-廣州 and 深圳-台北 (together as one round trip). These have made my travel 
realized and are also a part of reason why I had arranged the travel of passing 廣州 and 深圳 as 
well as 北京 (Russia airline had lowest price for air-ticket to Russia). The pass-by visits to 中科院
半导体所 and 北京大學 have made us to enhanced/established the research collaborations, which 
are also very useful to our current research at 國立台灣大學.  
 
These 2-papers have been accepted by Materials Science Forum – an EI journal, as below: 
(1) Hua Yang Sun, Siou-Cheng Lien, Zhi Ren Qiu, Zhe Chuan Feng, “Temperature dependence of 
Raman scattering in 4H-SiC”, Mat. Sci. Forum, in press. 
(2) Wei Zheng, Zhe Chuan Feng, Rui Sheng Zheng, Ling-Yun Jang
 
and Chee Wei Liu, “3C-, 4H- 
and 6H-SiC bulks studied by Si K-edge X-ray absorption”, Mat. Sci. Forum, in press. 
 
These two papers compiled by Materials Science Forum are listed in next pages. 
 
 
As seen above, through this conference, I’ve gain a lot of useful scientific knowledge and 
information, made good exchanges on research and contacted many professors and scientists, 
in particular from Russia, Germany, France, UK, Sweden, Spain, Switzland and more 
European countries, Japan, USA, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Tailand, India, etc. These are very 
helpful and important to our continual developments in our advanced research and work.

Three bulk 4H-SiC samples with different carrier concentration were prepared, as listed in Table 1. 
Sample 4H03 is undoped, 4HZ02 has a low carrier concentration of 1.45 x 10
18 
cm
-3
, while 4H01 
possesses a higher carrier concentration of 6.40 x 10
18 
cm
-3
, both from nitrogen (N) dopings.

A confocal Raman Microscopy Renishaw system was employed to study these bulk 4H-SiC 
samples. This advanced system has good resolution and detective ability, and is equipped with a 
80K-870K temperature variation attachment.  
 
Temperature dependent Raman spectra  
Fig. 1 (a) shows Raman spectra of three 4H-SiC samples at room temperature (RT). In the 
backscattering         geometric configuration, where z||c; x, y⊥c, A1, E1 and E2 modes can be 
observed. 4H-SiC, with    symmetry, presents the phonon bands with A1, E1 and E2 symmetries. 
The planar E2 mode is observed at 776 cm
-1
, the E1 transverse optic (TO) mode at 797 cm
-1
, the E2 
planar acoustic mode (TA) at 206 cm
-1
 and A1(LA) mode at 610 cm
-1
. The mode being located 
about 1000 cm
-1
 should be A1(LO) mode, which should be of symmetric peak. While, actually, it 
shows asymmetry lineshape due to overlap with an asymmetrically broaden mode – longitudinal 
optical-plasma coupling (LOPC) mode. These two modes, A1(LO) and LOPC mode, merge together 
and form a broaden asymmetric A1(LO)+LOPC mode peak, which will become more broaden when 
carrier concentration of 4H-SiC increases and can be obviously noticed in Fig. 1.

Figure 2. Theoretical fitting for temperature dependent Raman shifts of three 4H-SiC samples. 
 
Theoretical fitting values and curves of A1(LA), E1(TO) and E2(TO) modes fit very well with 
the experimental data. However, an abnormal behavior can be observed for the doped 4H-SiC in the 
longitudinal optical-plasma coupling (LOPC) mode, which does not decrease in frequency 
monotonously when temperature increases like other Raman modes or undoped sample. It increases 
at relatively low temperature and begins to drop after a critical temperature, as shown in Fig. 3.

This can be explained by effect from LOPC mode on A1(LO) peak. Peaks of these two modes 
are too close to be distinguished. Therefore, the existence of LOPC mode causes the deviation of 
A1(LO) peak position, which should vary with temperature normally as other modes like E1 and E2 
modes. Further work should be done on the penetrating analyses of these Raman spectra and their 
variations with temperature, to reveal the physics behind this abnormal T-behavior.   
 
Summary 
Confocal Raman Microscopy was used to analyze three 4H-SiC bulk samples, undoped, low and 
medium doped. All were measured at temperature varying from 80K to 873K. Five modes, of 
A1(LA), E2 (TO), E1 (TO), A1(LO) and LOPC, were observed. Theoretical model was used to fit the 
experimental data, matched well for A1(LA), E1(TO) and E2(TO) modes. But A1(LO)+LOPC mode 
peaks showed abnormal T-behavior, possibly due to the influence from the LOPC mode.

Abstract. High-resolution synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption of Si K-edge have been 
employed to investigate 6H-, 4H- and 3C-SiC. Detailed analyses of the extended x-ray absorption 
fine structure are taken by using the IFEFFIT program, and significant results on the atomic 
bonding are obtained from these comparative studies. The x-ray absorption near-edge structures of 
the Si K-edge are investigated, and the electronic structure of 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC are studied. In 
order to investigate the angular dependence, the x-ray absorption near-edge spectra were operated at 
55
o
 and 90
o
 of the angle between the surface and the X-ray direction.  
Introduction 
For many years, silicon carbide (SiC) has been praised for its remarkable material properties, 
such as high breakdown dielectric strength, high chemical and thermal stability, high thermal 
conductivity, and high electron mobility. During past two decades, SiC has reached an electronic 
material maturity. Both 4H- and 6H-SiC polytypes are industrial produced, and high voltage 
electronic devices have been commercialized based on these hexagonal SiC bulks [1,2]. The pure 
cubic 3C-SiC has many benefits for MOS devices over other polytypes for the smaller band gap. In 
addition, the electron hall mobility is higher and isotropic compared 4H- and 6H-SiC polytypes [3]. 
The x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides a powerful tool to investigate the structure of 
materials [4-8]. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) encompasses both the x-ray absorption 
near-edge structure (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). EXAFS can 
describe the species of neighboring atoms and the structural environment around a selected species

nearest neighbor Si-C (or Si-Si) peak position or amplitude. To extract the bond length information, 
structural models based on zincblende 3C-SiC and wurtzite 4H- and 6H-SiC were building, 
respectively, using the package IFEFFIT. Fitting results of the Fourier transforms are shown in Fig. 
3 with red lines, which are in good agreement with the measurements. The detail information of 
fitting results is listed in Table 1. RSi-C is denoted the distance of the Si atom to the nearest 
neighboring C atom in bilayer, i.e. bond length of Si-C; RSi-Si is denoted the distance of the Si atom 
to the nearest neighboring Si atom in bilayer, i.e. bond length of Si-Si. The fitting results of RSi-C 
and RSi-Si are reasonable.

XANES results and discussion 
XANES refers to the region of the XAS spectrum dominated by strong photoelectron scattering 
that extends about 40eV above an absorption edge [10]. XANES probes the bonding state of 
molecules, the conduction band of crystalline materials, and the bond orientation. The XANES 
spectrum results from electron dipole transitions from initial atomic orbital states with l character 
(where l is the electric dipole momentum of the electron) to final states in the conduction band (or 
to states of antibonding molecular orbitals in the case of molecules) with l ± 1 character. In the case 
of crystalline solids, the XANES spectrum depends on the material and the local symmetry around 
the central absorbing atom. Si K-edge XANES spectra of three samples are shown in Fig. 4, and the 
spectra were measured using the sample current mode at room temperature.
