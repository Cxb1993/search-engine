Abstract 
We derive the symbol error probability expressions for orthogonal space-time block codes  
with any form of generalized complex orthogonal design (GCOD) employing arbitrary 
rectangular QAM signaling over correlative fading channels. By first decorrelating the physical 
branches into uncorrelated virtual branches, a general expression for the moment generating 
function (MGF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio is obtained from which the SEP is derived. 
The result can be applied to correlative fading channels with any form of Gaussian fading gains. 
Moreover, channels having joint fading models as well as mixed channel powers are considered. 
We also discover that, for certain GCOD codes, different information symbols may exhibit 
different SEP’s. The above features are demonstrated by two GCOD examples used for 
simulations. Theoretical performance curves are compared with Monte Carlo simulated results in 
excellent agreement.

Rather than the pdf-based approach adopted in [15] and [16],
the moment generating function (MGF)-based approach should
prove to be a more convenient tool for calculating SEP for
digital systems over fading channels [23]–[25]. In this paper,
we present the derivations of SEP expressions using MGF-
based approach for OSTBC with any form of GCOD and
for the general case of correlative fading models, viz., branch
channels with various forms of complex Gaussian gains. As a
result, our general SEP expression can be readily deduced to
Rayleigh, Nakagami, and Ricean fading results. For Rayleigh
and Nakagami fading, exact closed-form SEP expressions can
be obtained with no unevaluated integrals or complex tran-
scendental functions. We shall consider arbitrary rectangular
QAM signal constellations. Most QAM cases studied in the
literature are square QAM constellations. However, arbitrary
rectangular QAM is a more general case which can be eas-
ily reduced to square QAM. Although in [31]–[33], we do
find treatments on arbitrary rectangular QAM signaling for
MRC diversity and AWGN channels, they give bit error rates
(BERs) for cases with constraints of Gray code mapping. The
process is cumbersome, limited to small-sized constellations,
and leads to results containing complex Gauss hypergeomet-
ric functions not accurately computable. Nonetheless, Gray
coding is not our subject of concern. Using the method by
Craig [34] or in [23]–[25], our SEP derivation can be read-
ily extended to other 2-D signaling schemes such as phase-
shift keying. Moreover, our result covers various scenarios
of channel power distribution, viz., channels with distinctive
power, identical power, or a combination of both. It can also
be reformed to include cases of joint fading models. Thus,
we have covered the most general cases which have not been
dealt with before. We also show that, for certain GCOD codes,
different information symbols may exhibit different SEPs. This
phenomenon or property of GCOD has never been disclosed
elsewhere.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses
the OSTBC diversity systems in correlative fading channels,
including conversion to corresponding uncorrelated virtual
channels. Both GCOD and COD will be addressed. Section III
derives the general MGF expression of received SNR for
OSTBC and for fading channels having any form of Gaussian
channel gains. Section IV derives the SEPs for OSTBC us-
ing arbitrary rectangular QAM over the uncorrelated virtual
channels with a combination of identical and distinct channel
powers. Then, Section V presents numerical results. Finally,
Section VI draws conclusions.
II. OSTBC DIVERSITY IN CORRELATED
FADING CHANNELS
Consider a wireless communication system with P transmit
antennas and Q receive antennas. Let the equivalent baseband
path gain from transmit antenna p to receive antenna q be
denoted by pq, p = 1, 2, . . . , P , q = 1, 2, . . . , Q. There are
L = PQ terms in the set {pq}. Stack these terms to form an
PQ× 1 vector h = [h1, h2, . . . hP , hP+1, hP+2, . . . , hL]T =
[11, 21, . . . , P1, 12, 22, . . . , PQ]T, where T denotes
transpose, and h1 = 11, h2 = 21, . . .. Define the Q× P
channel gain matrix as
H =


 . (1)
Note that h is the vector formed by stacking columns of HT.
We denote h = vec(HT) [21].
The lth channel gain is hl = hcl + jhsl, l = 1, 2, . . . , L,
with hcl and hsl being independent real random variable (RV)
with means h¯cl, h¯sl and variances σ2hcl and σ2hsl, respectively.
Therefore, E[hl] = h¯l = h¯cl + jh¯sl and V [hl] = σ2hl =
E[|hl|2]− |h¯l|2 = σ2hcl + σ2hsl, where E[·] and V [·], respec-
tively, denote expectation and variance. Assuming flat fading,
when an information symbol xk (k = 1, 2, . . . ,K, where
K is the number of information symbols in one OSTBC
transmission block) is transmitted, the received signal and
noise of the lth channel are hlxk and nl, respectively, where
nl = ncl + jnsl is a complex Gaussian RV with ncl and
nsl being independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) real
Gaussian RVs with zero mean and variance σ2n for all l. Let
Eav = E[|xk|2]; then, the short-term (hl held fixed) received
SNR at the lth channel is given by
γl =
E[|hlxk|2]
2σ2n
= |hl|2Eav2σ2n
= zlz∗l (2)
where zl = zcl + jzsl = hl
√
Eav/2σ2n is the scaled channel
gain to include the scaling factor
√
Eav/2σ2n, and ∗ de-
notes complex conjugation. Thus, E[zl] = z¯l = z¯cl + jz¯sl =
h¯l
√
Eav/2σ2n and V [zl] = σ2zl = σ2zcl + σ2zsl = Eavσ2hl/2σ2n.
Define the scaled gain vector z = [z1, z2, . . . , zL]T. Then, the
combined received SNR (as for MRC) is γ = zHz =∑Ll=1 γl,
where H denotes Hermitian transpose. When channels are
correlated, the covariance matrix for z is an L× L Hermitian
matrix given by
C = E
[
(z− z¯)(z− z¯)H] . (3)
Unless C is rank deficient (C has one or more zero eigen-
values hence the system diversity order is less than L), C
is positive definite and hence has L real positive eigenvalues
{λl} [21], [35]. Then, C can be unitary diagonalized as C =
UΛUH, where Λ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries
{λl} arranged in descending order and U is a unitary matrix
whose columns are corresponding eigenvectors. We thus have

If we define hl,k = bl,khl, hk = [h1,k, h2,k, . . . , hL,k]T, and
ηk =
∑L
l=1 ηl,k, we can rewrite (10) as
xˆk = ‖hk‖2xk + ηk (12)
where ηk is now a complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and
variance ‖hk‖2σ2n in each dimension. The {hl,k} are still corre-
lated and can be regarded as modified channel gains absorbing
the {bl,k} coefficients into the original physical channel gains
{hl}. Notice the slight difference of (12) from (8). Unlike (8)
where all information symbols have the identical channel gain
and Gaussian noise, the equivalent SISO model of (12) shows
that each information symbol is associated with its own channel
gain and Gaussian noise (due to the subscript k). For different k,
‖hk‖2 and, hence, ηk may be different. As a result, in GCOD,
each information symbol may experience a different SEP. This
important discovery has never been pointed out before. The
particular GCOD code examples used in [13], [19], and [20]
will not show this phenomenon since for those GCOD codes,
‖hk‖2 happens to be equal for all k. However, despite the
slight difference, both (8) and (12) exhibit the same SISO form
as for an MRC receive diversity system. Thus, treating these
modified channel gains {hl,k} as the way we treated {hl} in
(2) through (5), we can also decorrelate {hl,k} into {h′l,k},
i.e., h′k = [h′1,k, h′2,k, . . . , h′L,k]T = UHk hk. Then, we modify
zl into zl,k = zcl,k + jzsl,k = hl,k
√
Eav/2σ2n. Also, (2) must
also be modified as
γl,k =
E
[|hl,kxk|2]
2σ2n
= |hl,k|2Eav2σ2n
= zl,kz∗l,k. (13)
Equations (3)–(5) will all remain valid, except that subscript k
must be added to all quantities. After decorrelation, the GCOD
counterpart of (10) becomes
xˆ′k = ‖h′k‖2xk + η′k. (14)
It is apparent that, depending on the structure of Uk, which
is related to the type of correlation, as well as the values
of {bl,k}, the uncorrelated virtual channels {h′l,k} may have
different power distribution from the original physical channels.
{h′l,k} could have distinct or identical average powers or a
combination of distinct and identical powers.
Since the uncorrelated virtual channels are equivalent to the
correlated physical channels, computing the SEP for virtual
channels automatically gives the SEP for the physical channels.
In the derivations that follow, the added subscript k for the
GCOD case will not affect all the results. Thus for convenience,
we will simply drop this subscript so that the derivations will
be valid for both COD and GCOD. The reader should keep in
mind that, from here on, all {zl} or {hl} for GCOD stand for
modified correlated channel gains that have absorbed the {bl,k}
coefficients and should not confuse them with the original
correlated physical channel gains as given in (2). For COD,
there should be no confusion as all {bl,k} are unity, and hence,
the original physical channels have not been modified (before
decorrelation).
III. GENERAL MGF
Since we need to use the MGF of the received SNR to calcu-
late error probabilities for digital systems over fading channels
[23]–[25], the problem now is to first find the MGF of γ = zHz
(again, keep in mind that this is the modified z for GCOD),
but γ′ = z′Hz′ = zHUUHz = γ. Therefore, equivalently, we
are to find the MGF of γ′. This is much easier to handle since
the components in z′ are now independent when channels have
Gaussian gains. Thus, the pdf of z′ is given by
f ({z′l}) = f ({z′cl, z′sl})
=
1
L∏

(z′cl−z¯′cl)2

+
(z′sl − z¯′sl)2
2σ2z′sl
]}
(15)
where σ2z′cl = V [z′cl], σ2z′sl = V [z′sl]. The MGF of γ can now
be readily obtained by straightforward calculation as
Mγ(s) =E

L∏
l=1
(1− 2σ2z′cls)1/2 (1− 2σ2z′sls)1/2
. (16)
Since the Gaussian RVs {z′cl, z′sl} are all independent, the above
multiple integration becomes rather easy to carry out.
The MGF given by (16) is a general expression that can
be applied to OSTBC diversity systems in correlated fading
channels having any form of Gaussian channel gains, including
Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Ricean fading. Thus, there is no
need to individually calculate the MGF for a particular fading
model that falls into this category of Gaussian gain channels.
Although, in [25], extensive treatments have been given for
MGF, the above results are not covered there. Also, our deriva-
tion is unique and concise.
If we started with identical variances σ2zcl = σ2zsl = σ2zl/2
(for each l), we would have the case of circularly symmet-
ric Gaussian channel gains [21]. Then, σ2z′cl = σ2z′sl = σ2z′l/2.
Further, using (5) and then (16) reduces to
Mγ(s) =

we readily obtain

We will consider only circularly symmetric Gaussian channel
gains. Then, using the result of (17), we have

(23)
We now consider the case of Rayleigh fading channels.
However, we must emphasize that our derivation can be readily
extended to Nakagami and Ricean fading channels. In a numer-
ical example shown later, depending on the GCOD used and
the type of channel correlation, physical Ricean fading channels
may turn into equivalent virtual channels having joint Rayleigh
and Ricean fading channels. Further, as stated earlier, we will
treat the general case of the uncorrelated virtual channels with
a combination of identical and distinct power values (i.e.,
after decorrelation). Thus, far, the SEP analyses given in the
literature have all been restricted to special cases of either
identical or distinct channel powers over a single fading model.
In numerical example A in Section V, the reader will see that
mixed channel powers, as well as mixed fading models do exist
in applications. Also, our general result can be readily extended
to deduce the results for special cases of virtual channels with
identical or distinct channel powers.
If, before decorrelation, the normalized complex channel
gain zl is Gaussian with zero mean and identical variances
in each real dimension, then we have Rayleigh fading. The
decorrelated gain z′l will also be Gaussian with zero mean and
identical variances σ2z′cl = σ2z′sl = σ2z′l/2. Also, z¯′l = 0 in (23).
Then, (23) reduces to the Rayleigh MGF as

(24)
For channels having combination of identical and distinct
powers, let L1 channels have identical SNR γ¯′1, L2 channels
have identical SNR γ¯′2, . . . , LR channels have identical SNR
γ¯′R, where
∑R

antennas given in Example A for 2 × 8 QAM signaling over Rayleigh fading.
by λ1 = 2σ2(1 + 2ρ), λ2 = λ3 = 2σ2(1− ρ). By finding the
three orthonormal eigenvectors to get the unitary matrix U,
then using z¯′ = E[z′] = [z¯′1, z¯′2, z¯′3]T = UHz¯, we readily find
that the virtual channel gain has mean z¯′ = [z¯′1, z¯′2, z¯′3]T =
[
√
3z¯1, 0, 0]T (note that z¯1 = z¯2 = z¯3 = µc + jµs). Again, by
(5), this means that the virtual channels {z′l} have one inde-
pendent channel z′1 with a maximum distinct channel power
given by 3µ2 + 2σ2(1 + 2ρ) and 2 independent channels z′2, z′3
with identical channel powers as 2σ2(1− ρ), where µ2 = µ2c +
µ2s and ρ = 0. Therefore, beginning with correlated physical
channels with identical powers and then performing decorre-
lation, the resultant uncorrelated virtual channels now have a
combination of identical and distinct channel powers, just as
we have desired for demonstration. Of more interest is that, if
the original three physical channels are Ricean (µ = 0), then
after decorrelation, we obtain one independent Ricean virtual
channel plus two i.i.d. Rayleigh virtual channels (joint fading
models as mentioned earlier). In other words, we have a case of
joint fading models in addition to mixed channel powers, which
is a case that has not been touched in the literature before.
For the above system, we present performance curves of
SEP versus average received SNR per physical channel (γ¯/L)
for 2 × 8 QAM signaling over Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and
Ricean fading, respectively, in Figs. 1–3. In all cases, we
choose ρ = 0.8. Then, we have used m = 2 for the Nakagami-
m fading and the Ricean factor KR = µ2/2σ2 = 7 dB for the
Ricean fading. According to [40], a Ricean factor of 7 dB is
typical of practical microcellular channels. In each figure, we
have also included the uncorrelated case of ρ = 0. Monte Carlo
simulations are also incorporated for comparison. It is seen that
theoretical curves are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo
simulated results. Then, Fig. 4 presents performance curves of
SEP versus KR for various γ¯/L values for the Ricean fading
case. Here, due to the highly nonlinear nature of the Ricean
distribution, we observe a local maximum in the small KR
region, which is similarly observed in [41].
Example B: Here, we use a GCOD example that will give
different SEPs for different information symbols. We adopt the
rate 3/5 GCOD code using P = 6 transmit antennas as given

論文名稱：Performance of OSTBC diversity for QAM over correlated fading channels 
心得： 
     We consider arbitrary rectangular QAM signaling in orthogonal space-time block code 
(OSTBC) diversity systems over correlated fading channels with Gaussian channel gains. We first 
decorrelate the physical branches into uncorrelated virtual branches to obtain a general moment 
generating function (MGF), from which closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) is then 
obtained for OSTBC with generalized complex orthogonal design (GCOD) and it is discovered 
that different information symbols may yield different SEP’s.

Here, png  is the codeword transmitted from the pth transmit 
antenna at the nth symbol instant, Nn ,...,2,1= . The code 
words are sent in blocks of N symbols. Each codeword png  
is a linear combination of information symbols { kx } and 
their conjugates { ∗kx }. The code rate is NK / . For QAM, 
the K information symbols { kx } for each block are selected 
from an M-ary QAM constellation. For GCOD, DGG =H ,

yield different SEP. This important discovery has never been

 We want to find the MGF of zz H=γ . Note that  
γγ ==′′=′ zUUzzz HHH .  So, equivalently, we are to find 
the MGF of lγ ′ . This is much easier to handle since the 
components in z′  are independent for Gaussian channel 
gains. The PDF of z′  is

  Substituting (17) and (18) into (13), we have the desired 
expression of SEP. Note that, by setting 1=rL  for all r, we 
have the result for distinct power channels. Then, by setting 
1=R , we have the result for identical power channels . 
 
V.   NUMERICAL RESULTS 
 We adopt the rate 3/5 GCOD code using 6=P  transmit 
antennas as given in [7]. For simplicity, we use one receive 
antenna. Thus, we have equivalently an order-6 diversity 
system ( 6=L ). The transmission matrix is of size 630×  [7, 
(6)]. The code uses 18=K  and 30=N . There are three 
groups (group A, B, C) yielding three different SEP’s. 
Assuming exponential correlation model, i.e., correlation 
coefficient between the lth and l ′ th channel gain is 
|| ll
ll
′−
′ = ρρ [5]. Beginning with correlated physical channels 
having identical channel powers and using 8.0=ρ , we find 
all 6 eigenvalues of  kC are distinctive. Thus, after 
decorrelation, the virtual channels will have distinct channel 
powers. The SEP vs. L/γ  performance curves for groups A, 
B, C for 82×  QAM signaling over Rayleigh fading are 
presented in Fig. 1. Monte Carlo simulated results are found 
in excellent agreement with the theoretical result. 
 VI.   CONCLUSION 
By channel decorrelation, we derive a general MGF 
expression from which closed-form SEP is obtained for 
arbitrary rectangular QAM signaling in OSTBC-GCOD 
diversity systems over correlated Rayleigh fading channels. 
We  discover that different information symbols may yield 
different performance. A GCOD example is given for 
demonstration. Theoretical SEP results are found in excellent 
agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.
