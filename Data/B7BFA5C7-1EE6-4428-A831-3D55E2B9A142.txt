The exploration and monitoring data of undersea are usually through cables. The transport 
mode of the data is affected by ocean condition and its depth, which is very inconvenient for 
receiving data. It also leads to growing cost of labor and time. The purpose of this research is to 
establish an underwater telemetry system and to test the system by measuring underwater 
background noise. Then, the noise is transfered to sea surface. In this study, the housing of the 
underwater platform is designed and background noise is acquired by array sensors on the 
housing. In this paper, the application of underwater wireless acoustic modem system is carried 
out with LabVIEW computer software. This system communicates the data between the 
underwater platform and the mother boat above sea surface. The experiment result shows 
underwater telemetry system has been developed successfully. It receives background noise in 
Kaohsiung Harbor, and transfers the measured data through underwater wireless communication.

2. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, underwater observatories and underwater information station has the advantage to 
expand observing range and long-term monitoring undersea. For acoustic telemetry systems, the 
researches have been involved in acoustic channel, modulation and demodulation, encoding and 
decoding. And all these are aimed to obtain maximum transport rate and higher transport 
reliability [1,2].  
The trend of current research of underwater observatory and acoustic telemetry system are 
related to real time telemetry on oceanographics. For example, Appell et al.[3] constructed a port 
information system in Tampa Bay, and Frye et al.[4] built an acoustically-linked telemetry system 
to obtain data from deep ocean bottom seismometer, and Benson et al.[5] designed of a low-cost 
acoustic modem, and Martini et al.[6] builded a portable coastal observatory in Massachusetts 
Bay. Through the observatory, the acoustic and RF data are linked from sea to shore and final 
connection to the web.

ABSTRACT  
For application in an underwater communication system or positioning system, a 
piezoelectric underwater sound transducer for converting electrical energy to acoustical energy 
in water has been designed to enhance sound radiation power. Most of important practical 
problems in transducers are concerned with the piezoelectric materials used for energy 
conversion and physical mechanism design of transducer. A bolt-clamped Langevin type 
transducer driven by stacked piezoelectric ceramics has been designed through iterative analysis 
using FEM method and constructed in order that it could operate with a similar intensity as a 
commercial sound projector at 20 kHz. Results of impedance test show that this type transducer 
possesses an obvious nature frequency of longitudinal mode at 17.72 kHz that is smaller than 
design value. The performance testing experiments for radiating sound carried out in a tank and 
measured by a hydrophone B&K 8104.The results indicate that this type projector can be used in 
a practical device for underwater communication or positioning. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Piezoelectric Langevin transducers are widely used in ultrasonic metal and plastic welding 
and some practical cases concerning very large ultrasonic power [1-3]. In this paper, we apply 
this type transducer in underwater acoustics such as underwater communication or positioning. 
Langevin type transducer is prestressed by a bolt, the piezoelectric ceramic circular plate with 
central hole was used as the driving element. In traditional transducer design, Langevin 
transducer was supposed to operate in longitudinal vibration mode. Therefore, the lateral 
dimensions of the transducer had to be much less than its longitudinal dimension and lateral 
vibration was ignored relative to longitudinal vibration. However, in order to the development of 
high power underwater sound projector, we usually have to design a relative larger cross-section 
transducer, and thus how to suppress the other induced vibration mode is very critical. 
In the following studies, the resonance frequency equation is first introduced, and a finite element 
method (FEM) has been used to study the natural frequency characteristics and vibration modes

diameter mm6.29= .

3 Experiments  
 
A bolt-clamped Langevin type transducer driven by four-element stacked piezoelectric 
ceramics was fabricated in our laboratory. Picture of this Langevin type transducer is shown in 
Fig.2. In this study, we select the resonance frequency and transmitting voltage response (TVR) 
to characterize this fabricated underwater project. The quality of this projector after bolt-clamped 
was characterized by measuring the in-air impedance spectra of the transducer using a NF 
Corporation FRA5097 impedance/gain phase analyzer. Impedance characteristics were also used 
to determine resonance frequency and Qm. Fig.3 shows the measured impedance spectra of a 
bolt-clamped Langevin transducer in air, and signifies the resonance frequency of first 
longitudinal vibration mode at 17720 Hz.

4 CONCLUSIONS  
 
This study designed and fabricated a bolt-clamped Langevin transducer driven by four-element 
stacked piezoelectric ceramics. FEM software has been used to study the natural frequency 
characteristics of piezoelectric Langevin transducers. The analyzed resonance frequency of first 
longitudinal mode is a little different from that obtained by experimental impedance measurement, 
and we suppose it is due to bonding problem. In the experimental result of transmitting voltage 
response, the maximum response does not occur at previous obtained resonance frequency but at 
7456 Hz, and we presume that it arises from the bending mode resonance. The results indicate

LabVIEW that can be divided into monitor and analysis interface and data acquisition interface. 
The function of underwater telemetry system utilizes surface modem floating on the surface of 
water that set up the parameter of the underwater vehicles and acquisition time of underwater 
background noise. After the bottom modem deployed underwater receives the command, it will 
the execute data acquisition and store, and upload the data to surface modem in the same time. In

下端板厚度 20 mm，整體重量(未含儀器) 309 kg，材料為低碳鋼（S15C）所製，其中降
伏強度為 250MPa。經由理論公式 (以水深 100 公尺)計算：圓桶型壓力殼降伏破壞應力為
18.55MPa，小於材料之降伏強度不會產生破壞，其可承受挫曲破壞應力為 307.35 MPa，
表示壓力殼在此深度下不會產生挫曲破壞，上、下板蓋之最大撓曲變形量為 0.06mm，尚
在彈性變形範圍內，最大集中應力為 172.71MPa，沒有大於材料之降伏強度，因此不會產
生破壞。經加工製作完畢後，由深海高壓模擬艙實際測試，實驗流程圖，如圖 10 所示，一
開始先將水密箱置入高壓艙內並蓋上高壓艙蓋鎖緊，接著將高壓艙進水與抽真空。之後，
吾人操作控制面板，設定壓力為 10 大氣壓力，經加壓時間分別為 1.5 與 6.5 小時，實驗結

深海域進行實驗。由實驗證明遙測系統可透過水下無線通訊達到資訊傳遞正確性與即時
性，其可成為水下資訊交換中心，有助於未來將此系統應用於水下量測與聲源定位之相關

National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan
Abstract
Similar Source method has been developed to describe interior and exterior
sound field by Too et al [Applied Acoustics, 58,261-281,1999][ Applied Acoustics, 63,
295-310, 2002] The application can be used for arbitrary boundary conditions in
terms of acoustic impedance. In the present study, a modified version of similar
source method is developed to describe the sound pressure distribution in a planar
surface. In addition, a signal processing procedure is developed to identify noise
source locations. This procedure contains a power spectrum analysis and acoustic
holographic analysis to identify different source locations. Several test examples are
shown to verify this approach
Effects of Sampling Rate on Active Noise Control Systems
S. R. Chen and G.-P. J. Too

National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan
Abstract
According to many experiments for ANC(Active Noise Control) system, it
was found that the order of FIR(Finite Impulse Response) filter and step size of
adaptive least mean square (LMS) algorithm will influence the result of noise control.
