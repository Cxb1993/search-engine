1. Introduction 
Control charts are effective tools in many industries to monitor processes with 
the objective of improving process quality and productivity. In recent years, statistical 
process control for autocorrelated processes has received a great deal of attention. 
This is due in part to the improvements in measurement and data collection 
technology that allow processes to be sampled at higher rate which often leads to 
autocorrelation.  
 There are two types of autocorrelated processes: short-term dependent 
processes and long-term dependent processes. Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is 
one of the latter that was put forward by Mandelbrot after Hurst’s findings, fractal 
theory. It has been successfully used to model the variate of many natural phenomena 
because it considers the dependence between each variate of natural phenomena. In 
addition to natural phenomena, it has been proved that fBm is the suitable model to 
describe many artificial processes, such as stock trend line of finance[1], the pressure 
signal in time at a certain height of industrial airlift reactor[16], hedging options in 
market models [3], and so forth.  
Recently, statistical process control (SPC) for short-term autocorrelated 
processes has received a great deal of attention. Approaches for dealing with such 
processes exist. But so far, no approaches are available for dealing with long-term 
autocorrelated processes such as fBm, which has been proved a suitable model to 
describe certain processes. Therefore, it is necessary to bring up an idea to help 
manager to monitor that. Since fBm process has some characteristic properties like 
self-similarity, increment stationarity, variance law and so on, this paper designs a 
guideline for monitoring by transforming the observations according to its properties. 
2. Research Objective 
The objective was to develop a guideline for monitoring fBm process. Generally, 
the most widely researched approaches of SPC for autocorrelated processes are 
residual-based control charts, which involve fitting some form of time series model to 
the data and the forecast errors or residuals from the model are used in the control 
charts. However, because of the significant and long-time autocorrelation, estimating 
the parameters of time series model like autoregressive moving average (ARMA) 
model will be difficult and inaccurate. The autoregressive T2 chart requires only the 
process autocorrelation function up to a pre-specified lag to form a multivariate vector 
for using. And this paper finds the relationship between the Hurst exponent of fBm 
and the autocorrelation function of the transformed data. Hence use the autoregressive

required to balance the outflow over a number of years. 
The basic questions of designing a capacity reservoir are how its outflow can be 
regulated economically to meet the shortages of low years, and what the capacity 
required to guarantee a certain minimum discharge is in these years. 
The size of reservoir required to maintain the maximum possible steady 
discharge during the period can be determined if the past annual discharges from the 
lake are given. This is the mean discharge for the period n and capacity of the 
reservoir is obtained by adding, algebraically, the departures from the mean to form a 
series of accumulated totals. The difference between the highest and lowest of these 
accumulated totals—that is, the range R— is (a) the maximum accumulated deficit 
when there is never a deficit, (b) the maximum accumulated deficit when there is 
never any storage, or (c) their sum when there is both storage and deficit. This range 
R is the storage required to maintain the average discharge. According to this concept, 
Hurst supposed rescaled range analysis: 
There is a reservoir fed by the discharge of water from a lake. In any given year 
the reservoir receives an influx from the lake and a regulated volume of water is 
released. Hurst let ( )x t  denote the inflow in year t then the average inflow over a 
period of T years is simply (1 )[ (1) (2) ( )]T x x x T+ + ⋅⋅⋅ + . Call this average inflow Tx . 
Now define the departure of the inflow from this average over a t-year time horizon to 
be ( , ) [( (1) ) ( (2) ) ( ( ) )]T T TX t T x x x x x t x= − + − + ⋅⋅⋅+ − . The difference between the 
minimum and the maximum accumulated inflow over a period of T years is what we 
call the range, denote by TR : 
max ( , ) min ( , )TR X t T X t T= −  
and the sample standard deviation is[12] 
2 2 2
1
2{(1 )[( (1) ) ( (2) ) ( ( ) ) ]}T T T TS T x x x x x T x= − + − +⋅⋅⋅+ −    
What Hurst discovered is that a large number of natural phenomena seem to be 
governed by a simple relation involving what’s now called the rescaled range, defined 
by the dimensionless ratio RT/ST. This quantity, in effect, scales the range by its 
standard deviation. Form a qualitative point of view it gives a standardized measure of 
the path length covered over a given time interval by the stochastic process. It is a 
statistical method used to study a wide range of phenomena. 
Hurst’s results showed that a lot of natural phenomena, ranging from flood levels 
on the Nile to trends in global temperature, changes seem to obey the relation 
T T
HR S aT= , where H is a number called the Hurst exponent and this relation is 
called Hurst Law.

Brown observed that small particles immersed in a liquid exhibit ceaseless irregular 
behavior. In 1905, Albert Einstein explained this motion in terms of perpetual 
collisions with molecules of the surrounding medium. He set 5.0TR = Norbert Wiener, 
in 1923, gave the first satisfactory mathematical construction of Brownian motion 
sample path and proved their “almost sure” (in the language of probability theory) 
continuity. 
Definition: A one-variable Brownian motion or Wiener process on an interval [a,b] is 
a Gaussian process X(t) such that  
1. X(0) = 0 and X(t) is almost surely continuous. 
2. Gaussian increment property: The increments 
       )()( 12 tXtXX −=Δ  
for t2＞t1 have Gaussian distributions with mean zero and variance σ2(t2 - t1), where 
σ is a positive constant. Equivalently,

for any 1t  and 2t  in the interval [a,b]. 
Brownian motion is a “self-similar” process and satisfies “Hurst law.” Thus, we 
obtain Standard deviation of X(t+s) - X(t) = sσ  for every t and s[4] 
Independent Increments Property: Two random variables X and Y are independent 
provided that for any real numbers x and y, 
Pr[X < x and Y < y] = Pr[X < x] Pr[Y<y] 
Brownian motion has independent increments in the sense then the increments 
are independent random variables. 
Markov property: A Brownian motion, and indeed any independent increment 
process, is a Markov process. This implies that the conditional probability that X(t2), 
reaches a certain value, given the value of X(t1), where t1 < t2  depends only on t1 and 
t2. It does not depend on the history of X(t) for t < t1.  One can think of a random

3.4The Autoregressive T2 Control Chart 
The basic idea of the T2 approach is to form a multivariate vector of a moving 
window of observations from a univariate autocorrelated process, and then apply 
multivariate control charts. The T2 approach supposes the process is Gaussian with 
autocovariance function [( )( )]k t t kE x xγ ξ ξ+= − − . Let 0ξ  denotes the mean when 
the process is in-control, and assume 0ξ  is known. Consider the sequence of 
p-dimensional vectors 1 2[  ]

univariate process. The covariance matrix of tX  is

The in-control average run-lengths (ARL) of all charts approximate 500. Results 
for other in-control ARLs exhibited the same general trends and are not shown. A 
following section of this paper discusses guidelines for selecting p and specifying α 
that is needed to achieve a desired in-control ARL for the autoregressive T2 control 
chart. 
The residual-based CUSUM chart signaled when the upper or lower CUSUM 
statistics exceeded the decision threshold h. The upper and lower CUSUM statistics 
are calculated recursively via  
St+ = max{0, St-1+ + et – k}  and  St– = max{0, St-1– + et – k} 
Where et is the residual for the observation at time t. 
The Shewhart chart signaled when the observation exceeds the upper control 
limit = μ + cσ or is below lower control limit = μ + cσ, where c is a constant we 
selected to make the in-control ARL approximate 500.In Table 1 we show the 
out-of-control ARLs of the different control charts with mean shift=1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In 
general, the autoregressive T2 chart outperforms the residual-based CUSUM charts 
and Shewhart charts when H or mean shift is large. For example, when H=0.9, the 
autoregressive T2 chart with p=10 has lower out-of-control ARL than residual-based

Finally, we can know the threshold for T2 and apply it to monitor the fBm 
process. The procedure is summarized as following: 
Step 1. Use R/S analysis to get Hurst exponent of time series 
Step 2. Transform the observations of fBm process to the fGn model by the statistical 
self-similarity properties of fBm. 
Step 3. Calculate the autocorrelation function of the fGn data to specify the optimal 
order of ARMA model that is used to fit the time series and the dimension of 
the vector using in T2 chart.

observations are plotted on the Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. Observation from fBm processes  
Suppose we know the H value of the process when it is in-control, set H = 0.8. 
And then we begin to detect this process: 
First, transform the observations by equation (1). Figure 3 is the observations after 
transformed and the original ones.

has been measured by that. But the model adopted to fit is not certainly accuracy. It is 
intuitive that fBm can be a good model to fit those. The method for monitoring fBm 
process presented in this paper will be useful in these applications. 
Based on the method and procedure presented in this paper, a program for 
monitoring fBm process may be developed in the QC software. Besides, a comparison 
with the existing method for monitoring autocorrelated process may be made by 
Monte Carlo simulation. And then we will clearly know the advantages of every 
method. Moreover, the Hurst exponent may be used to estimate the standard deviation 
of the process while it is usually estimated by the range and variance of the samples. 
If we find the relationship between the two, maybe we can develop a control chart 
designed for fBm process based on original observations without transformed. And its 
advantage is easily understood. Since a lot of synthesis techniques of fractional 
Brownian motion exit, it is possible to find a way to synthesize an fBm process in 
terms of its parameters and properties to fit the one want to detect, and then computes 
the residuals. The residuals will be regarded as random variables if it is an unbiased 
estimation. Hence we can plot those residuals on the standard control chart and 
monitor them. Those subjects and directions may be able to be extended from this 
article in the future.

Plan achievement 
In the paper, we successfully develop a method for monitoring the fBm process. 
The concept we use is to combine the autoregressive T2 control chart with fractional 
Brownian motion. 
We make the statistical self-similarity of fractal as the foundation to construct the 
method similar to the SPC. And then find the time that the process is out-of-control 
and repair the process ahead of time. 
Among the literatures of the foreign and domestic, this plan makes fractal theory 
apply in the quality control field first of all. Our objective is to rely on the fBm 
process, to minimize the cost of engineering process, to increase the profit of industry, 
to raise the industry competition and there are innovative contributions to the field of 
Quality Control.

Abstract. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated approach to 
process design for air cargo transportation. This work integrated the methodologies 
of fuzzy set theory (FST), balanced scorecard (BSC), and theory of constraints 
(TOC) to ensure that the internal process design meets the needs of employees, 
shareholders, and customers, concurrently. This integrated approach is constructed 
by three stages. In the first stage, the strategies, strategic objectives, and key 
performance indicators (KPIs) of the company are developed through the 
conceptual framework of BSC. In the second stage, the initiator’s actions are 
developed through the five logic tools of TOC. Furthermore, in the third stage, 
through the integration of BSC and TOC with fuzzy quality function deployment 
(QFD), KPIs and initiator’s actions were transformed into the design requirements 
and the technical requirements. Finally, the house of quality (HOQ) is built for 
designing the service process of air cargo transportation based on fuzzy QFD.

Introduction 
Air cargo transportation industry has three characteristics: strict control, peak time 
influence, and internationalization. Because of these factors stated above, air cargo 
transportation industry is very distinctive from traditional transportation industry. 
Therefore, the process management is also a crucial to air cargo transportation industry 
according to the complexity of air cargo transportation logistics chain and the 
characteristics of air cargo transportation industry. 
As air cargo industry focuses on process management beyond organizational 
boundaries, there is a need to develop an integrated process design for air cargo 
transportation. The most logical and viable alternative under the present circumstances 
would be to become more efficient through better design of existing facilities, 
resources and process flow. In our study, we are concerned with process design of the 
air cargo transportation. Meanwhile, the purpose of this study is to propose an 
integrated process design based on BSC, TOC, QFD, and FST for air cargo 
transportation.

 whole industry). Resource constraints are the second constraint, and market constraints 
are the third constraint [10]. However, the policy constraints include behavior 
constraint, managerial constraint, and logistical constraint. 
Five logic trees have been developed by Goldratt’s TP. That helps to solve 
physical constraints and policy constraints. TP has probed the core problem deeply by 
the current reality tree (CRT). TP finds out conflict conquering win-win alternatives in 
order to enhance process quality and effectiveness by the evaporating cloud (EC) 
diagram and future reality tree (FRT). The final step, pre-requisite tree (PRT) and 
transition tree (TT) infer the effective alternatives and initiator’s actions in order to 
solve the core problem and achieve the desirable effects. 
QFD is a well-structured design tool; HOQ is the core of QFD. The conventional 
HOQ to quantify the relationships is accomplished using 3-point scale or 5-point scale 
to denote relationships between each WHATs and each HOWs [20]. However, in 
practice the relationships are usually vague and imprecise, and can be described in 
linguistic terms. In this work, the relationships are represented as linguistic terms, and 
conversion scales are applied to transform linguistic terms into fuzzy numbers. A scale 
of five for importance weight and relationship are used in this study. 
Table 1 presents relative importance of WHATs and relationship between each 
WHATs and each HOWs considered as linguistic variables. The trapezoidal fuzzy 
number is easy to use and interpret. For example, a very significant weight of a specific 
requirement can be measured by a trapezoidal fuzzy number and denoted by (7, 10, 10, 
10).

After obtaining the necessary data from the participants in the company, the 
following computational procedure is performed to determine the normalized design 
requirement scores. The arithmetic operations on trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are 
employed. 
Step 1: Determine the degree of importance (or reliability) of the participants. If the 
degrees of importance (or reliability) of participants are equal, then the group of 
participants is called a homogeneous group. Otherwise, the group is called a 
heterogeneous (non-homogeneous) group [21].

 The fuzzy QFD takes only customer requirements into consideration for the product 
design, whereas the design of service process for air cargo transportation have to 
include customers, employees as well as shareholders requirements into consideration, 
due to the fact that the process is more complicated and has many upstream and 
downstream interfaces. Through the application of BSC, consideration of customers, 
employees, and shareholders requirements, and TOC, analysis of bottleneck process, 
the authors apply fuzzy QFD to integrate BSC and TOC into HOQ. 
This article focuses the research on the internal process perspective and proposes 
an integrated design framework. First, we use the BSC methodology for a company to 
develop the framework for establishing its design requirements in the first stage of 
deployment of fuzzy QFD. In the second stage of deployment of fuzzy QFD, this study 
applies the TP of TOC to deploy the technical requirements for the internal process 
perspective. Finally, the HOQ is built for designing the internal process of air cargo 
transportation based on fuzzy QFD methodology (as shown in Fig. 1).

Stage one: BSC to meet customer requirements and design requirements 
The BSC framework is used to develop the customer requirements and design 
requirements in this stage to meet in air cargo transportation design (as shown in Fig. 
2). It ensures that all employees are in line and are striving toward a common mission.

Fig. 2 BSC to meet customer requirements and design requirements 
Kaplan and Norton [4] stated that BSC has four characteristics, which help to link the 
long-term objectives and short-term actions together. First, build consensus through the 
discussion of company’ s mission and vision. Second, through cause-and-effect analysis, 
 achieved, the injection can be achieved, thus solve the core problem. Finally, the 
initiator’ s actions construct the technical requirements for the service process design. 
Stage three: The integration of BSC and TP with fuzzy QFD 
The core of fuzzy QFD is the matrix, called the HOQ. In the first deployment, the 
four perspectives of BSC constitute the “WHATs” matrix, which are the needs of all 
the stakeholders, of fuzzy QFD. The procedure of balanced business scorecard for 
formulating the KPIs can be applied to derive the “HOWs” matrix to meet the 
customers’  requirements associated with fuzzy QFD. In the second deployment, the 
KPIs of BSC constitute the “WHATs” matrix, which are the design requirements, of 
fuzzy QFD. The procedure of TP for formulating the initiator’ s actions constructs the 
“HOWs” matrix, which can be applied to derive the technical requirements associated 
with fuzzy QFD. 
4. Conclusions 
As the air cargo transportation industry incorporates a complex industrial logistics 
chain, the air cargo transportation industry should focus on process management 
beyond organizational boundaries. Thus, this study proposes an integrated approach to 
process design for air cargo transportation based on the methodologies of BSC, TP, and 
fuzzy QFD. This approach is constructed by three stages. First, we use the BSC 
methodology for a company to develop the framework for establishing its design 
requirements. In the second stage of deployment of fuzzy QFD, this study applies the 
TP of TOC to deploy the technical requirements. Finally, the HOQ is built for 
designing the process of air cargo transportation based on fuzzy QFD. 
The design and redesign of service process for air cargo transportation need huge 
capital expenditure, thus, it also needs the voice of shareholders and employees, not 
only the voice of customers. The BSC methodology involves the voice of shareholders, 
customers, and employees through the four perspectives—financial perspective, 
customer perspective, internal process perspective, and learning & growth perspective. 
TP of TOC can also be used to deploy the design requirements of four perspectives, 
and the technical requirements are built from the five logic tools. Fuzzy QFD can be 
used to predict problems in advance of operation or post sales service during the design 
stage. Through fuzzy QFD, the KPIs that developed by BSC can be transformed into 
the design requirements, and the initiator’ s actions, which developed, by TP can also be 
transformed into the technical requirements. 
This study only considers the framework and procedures of process design for air 
cargo transportation is one of the limitations of this research. Therefore, how to apply 
the proposal method systematically to a case study need to be included in future 
research. Besides, how to consider the quantitative factors into the proposal method in 
the development of the optimal model for service process design of air cargo 
transportation also needs to be included in future work.
