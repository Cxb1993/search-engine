high order neural networks (HONNs) into a hybrid neural network (HNN). Each HNN layer 
connector is dominated by an alternating linear and high order layer connector. The participation of 
fuzzy logic facilitates HNN model evolution into a fuzzy hybrid neural network (FHNN) model, 
with some modifications that make it different from EFNIM. Within the proposed evolutionary 
fuzzy hybrid neural network (EFHNN) model, this study further employed GA to optimize FL 
membership functions and HNN connection types, topology and coefficients. Obviously, some 
additional variables of concern remained when comparing EFHNN to EFNIM. This study further 
applied the proposed EFHNN to handle problems in construction industry. 
The remaining sections of this study include Section II: an introduction to an EFHNN that 
involves GA, FL, NN and HONN; Section III: topics in construction management; Section IV: 
EFHNN results; Section V: conclusions. 
 
2. The Evolutionary Fuzzy Hybrid Neural Network (EFHNN) 
The proposed EFHNN incorporates four artificial intelligence approaches, namely the neural 
network (NN), high order neural network (HONN), fuzzy logic (FL) and genetic algorithm (GA) 
(see Fig. 1). NN and HONN comprise the inference engine, i.e., the proposed hybrid neural network 
(HNN); FL dominates fuzzifier and defuzzifier layers; and GA optimizes the HNN and FL. In 
accordance with the definition of “neuro with fuzzy input-output” given by Hayashi et al. (Hayashi 
et al. 1998), this study proposes a fuzzy hybrid neural network (FHNN) comprising an HNN with 
fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs (see Fig. 2). Each HNN connection may select a linear or high order 
NN connector. Sequentially, the FHNN is optimized through a GA adaptation process (see Fig. 3). 
The process uses GA to search simultaneously for optimum FL membership functions, 
defuzzification coefficients, HNN topologies and HNN parameters (including linear/high order 
connection types), with P(t) denoting a population at generation t, PO(t) an offspring population at 
generation t and PM(t) a mutation population at generation t. Details of FL, HNN and GA are 
described in the following sections.

adopting two as the maximum number of layer connections, possible HNN candidates are L, HO, 
L-L, L-HO, HO-L, and HO-HO. If N is adopted as the maximum number of HNN layer connections 
(i.e., the final HNN model is an HNN with a number of layers not greater than N), then HNN model 
candidates are 21, 22,…, 2N, respectively, related to HNN 1, 2,…, N layers. In summary, of the (2N-2) 
HNN model candidates, only (N) models select all L connections. All others are categorized in this 
study into high order neural networks. The proposed HNN includes all linear and high order neural 
networks according to connection type selections, which are dominated by GA evolution.

2.2 Fuzzy Logic Facilities 
    Zadeh (1965) first proposed Fuzzy Logic as a tool with which to describe uncertainty and 
imprecision. In Fig. 2, HNN is enclosed between fuzzification and defuzzification layers. The 
complete structure is a fuzzy hybrid neural network. In the fuzzification layer, the membership 
function (MF) initially assigns inputs into one of several membership grades. In this study, a 
complete MF set using trapezoidal MF was adopted. A general approach to describing MF shapes is 
to depict MF summit positions (smi) and widths (wdi) (Ko et al., 2007; Hayashi et al., 1998). An 
input can then be assigned to several membership grades with MF. Initially, MF inputs are bound 
between the range of layer inputs, and membership function inputs are usually set within (0,1). 
However, owing to adopted equation (2), if one membership function output has a value of zero, 
related HNN neurons will output zero values through the sigma-pi Π operator. To prevent such, this 
study modified the original MF to the output range (0.0001,1) (see Fig. 5). Following the 
aforementioned descriptions, all membership functions are characteristic of values of sm and wd. In 
the defuzzification layer (see Fig. 2), this study adopted a weighted average formula, as follows: 
∑∑== lk klkkl
x
xy α
αψ )(  (4) 
where ψ is a defuzzification function; α represents defuzzification weights; xk denotes the eventual 
outputs of HNN; and yl represents final FHNN outputs. Consequently, GA evolution will dominate 
sm, wd and α.

both w and p for each neuron; and 5) a slope for each activation functions.

4.1 EFHNN Results for Problems in Construction Management 
  Owing to the paragraph length is limited. Only results of performance prediction of 
subcontractor are briefly introduced in this report. Fig. 7 shows the final EFHNN model phenotype 
of sub-contractors performance prediction. The proposed high order NN connection was employed 
as the second NN connection. In the authors’ experience, a high order connection always appears in
