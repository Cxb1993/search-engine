移動率與量子幾何結構的相關性產生影響。 
最後吾人探討對於鍺通道雙閘極電晶體，量子效應對電洞遷
移率之影響。低電場之電洞遷移率是透過蒙地卡羅方法求
得。模擬結果得知，對於 (100) /[110] 「矽」通道，電洞
遷移率隨著通道厚度變薄而減少。此模擬結果與實驗相符
合。然而對於(100)/[100]「鍺」通道，電洞遷移率在某個通
道厚度下具有最大值。此現象乃因「次能帶內」散射與「次
能帶間」散射交互作用下所產生。在(110)/[-110]「鍺」通
道方向上，亦可發現相同情形。此外，吾人發現當單軸壓縮
應力施於(100)/[110]或(110)/[-110]鍺通道上時，電洞遷移
率將可進一步提昇。

ABSTRACT 
 
This report will focus on the reliability issue, negative bias temperature 
instability (NBTI) in advanced gate dielectric (high-k). The Monte Caro simulation 
and its applications to advanced CMOS devices are studied as well, especially in 
nanowire-like devices. 
Origins of a NBTI induced Vt distribution in small-area HfSiON gate dielectric 
pMOSFETs are explored and characterized. We measure individual trapped hole 
creation times and corresponding threshold voltage shifts during NBTI stress in a 
large number of devices. Wide dispersion of trap creation characteristic times in 
several decades is observed, which we attribute to an activation energy distribution in 
the reaction-diffusion (RD) model. We extract an activation energy distribution 
including a local electric field effect from measured characteristic times. A statistical 
model for an NBTI Vt distribution by employing the RD model and convolving 
extracted activation energy and a single trapped hole induced Vt shift is developed. 
Our model reproduces measurement results of an overall NBTI induced Vt 
distribution and its stress time evolutions well. 
NBTI trapped charge characteristics and recovery mechanisms are examined by 
a statistical study of individual trapped charge emissions in small-area HfSiON/metal 
gate pMOSFETs. We measure trapped charge emission times in NBTI recovery in a 
large number of devices. The characteristic time distributions of the first three emitted 
holes are obtained. The distributions can be well modeled by using a 
thermally-assisted tunnel (ThAT) detrapping model. NBTI trapped charge energy and 
spatial distributions and its activation energy distribution in the ThAT model are 
VII 
 
dependence of electron mobility on the quantum structure geometry. 
The quantum confinement effects on hole mobility in Ge-channel double gate 
MOSFETs are studied. The low-field hole mobility is calculated by a Monte Carlo 
simulation. Our simulation result shows that the hole mobility in a (100)/[110] silicon 
well decreases with a decreasing well thickness, which is in agreement with the 
experimental result. The hole mobility in a Ge-channel pMOSFET, however, exhibits 
a peak in a sub-20 nm well because of the interplay between intra-subband and 
inter-subband scatterings. The peak mobility in (110)/[-110] channel direction can be 
also achieved. Moreover, we find that the hole mobility can be further improved when 
the uni-axial compressive stress is applied to (100)/[110] or (110)/[-110] channel 
direction. 
In this project period, one patent and 12 papers have been published, including 3 
TED papers, 3 EDL papers, 1 APL paper, 1 IEDM paper, 2 IRPS papers, 1 VLSI 
paper and 1 VLSI-TSA paper. Besides, the chapter three “Statistical Characterization 
of BTI-Induced High-k Dielectric Traps in Nanoscale Transistors” of book “Bias 
Temperature Instability for Devices and Circuits” published by Springer is written.

the RD model [10]-[13], the RD model alone is insufficient to predict an entire Vt 
distribution in small area devices.  
A Vt shift in an NBTI stressed device can be expressed as the sum of each 
individual trapped charge induced vt, i.e., ,1 v
N
t t ii
V

   , where N is a total 
number of stress created traps in a device and vt denotes a single trapped charge 
caused Vt shift. Two factors affect a Vt distribution. One is the dispersion of vt and 
the other is fluctuations in number of traps N in stressed devices. The origin and the 
magnitude distribution of vt have been investigated thoroughly [14][15]. Previous 
characterization and 3D atomistic simulation show that a vt exhibits an exponential 
distribution approximately, i.e., f(|vt|)=exp(−|vt|/s)/s, due to a random substrate 
dopant induced current-path percolation effect [14][16]. To derive a Vt distribution, 
we still need a distribution model for a trap number N. In literature, a Poisson 
distributed N was usually assumed [14][15][17]. The Poisson model is, however, 
based on a notion that individual trapped charge creations during NBTI stress are 
independent. In other words, each new trap creation in a device has the same 
probability regardless of how many traps have been created. Nevertheless, the RD 
model and measurement result show that NBTI degradation obeys a power-law 
dependence on stress time, i.e., t
1/n
 with n~6 [13][18], implying that a new trap 
creation rate decreases with an increasing trapped charge number. Therefore, the use 
of a Poisson model is contradictory to the RD model and measurement result and may 
exaggerate N and a Vt distribution tail significantly. To resolve this discrepancy, 
Alam et al simulated a trap number distribution by using a Markov Chain Monte 
Carlo method [19] to consider stochastic process of trap generation within a RD 
framework. However, they did not consider the dispersion of activation energy in the 
RD model. As a result, their simulated trap characteristic time distribution is much 
4 
 
during the stress. The subthreshold Id−Vg characteristics before and after an NBTI 
stress are shown in the inset of Fig. 1.1. An almost parallel shift after stress is 
observed, thus indicating that Vt degradation is mainly caused by fixed trapped charge 
creation rather than interface trap creation. Both SS and gm degradations are less than 
5% in the stress period. For simplicity, a constant transconductance is used when 
converting Id into a Vt trace in Fig. 1.1. Each abrupt Vt change (vt,i) in Fig. 1.1 is 
due to a single trapped hole creation, where i denotes a trapped charge creation 
sequence number. We collect all vt,i in about 130 devices. The magnitude 
distribution of vt is plotted in Fig. 1.2. The solid line in Fig. 1.2 represents an 
exponential fit with a slope (s) of 3.3mV. 
 
1.2.3 Characteristic Times for Trapped Charge Creation 
In addition to vt, individual trapped charge creation times are clearly defined in 
Fig. 1.1. We collect the first three trapped hole creation times, i.e., i, i=1,2,3, in about 
130 devices. The probability density functions (PDFs) of log(i) are shown in Fig. 1.3. 
It should be remarked that about 3% devices have less than 3 traps created in a stress 
period of 100sec. Table 1.1 shows the mean (<log(i)>) and the standard deviation (i) 
of the three log(i) distributions. For comparison, the <log(i)> and i in NBTI 
recovery from [22] are also shown in the Table 1.1. Distinctly different features 
between stress mode and recovery mode are noticed. We find that 
<log(i)>−<log(1)>~nlog(i) and the standard deviations1>2>3 in NBTI stress 
while <log(i+1)>−<log(i)>~constant and the standard deviations1<2<3 in NBTI 
recovery. The detail explanations for the features in NBTI recovery has been given in 
Chapter 2. In this Chapter, we are focused on the characteristics of stress. 
The measured i spreads over several decades of time. There are two possible 
6 
 
(1.3) 
 
By re-arranging the terms in Eq. (1.1), the relationship between the i-th trapped 
charge creation time (i) and effective activation energy is shown below  
 
(1.4) 
 
From the above equation, the relationship of the mean of the log(i) is obtained,  
 
(1.5) 
 
n is about 5.6 in our measurement in an initial stress stage. Thus, we can therefore 
obtain <log(2)>−<log(1)>=5.6log(2)=1.69 and <log(3)>−<log(1)>=5.6log(3)=2.67 
without regard to activation energy. The calculated result from Eq. (1.5) is in 
reasonable agreement with the measurement result in Table 1.1. 
 
1.2.4 Activation Energy Distribution 
In the following, we will extract an activation energy distribution from measured 
trap characteristic times. By re-arranging the terms in Eq. (1.4), effective activation 
energy can be readily obtained as follows, 
 
(1.6) 
 
We can translate the measured log(i) distribution into a relative activation 
energy distribution by subtracting a term nlog(i) from it. Extracted Eeff distributions

degradation in our stress period possibly because of fewer pre-existing traps in the 
current samples. 
 
1.3.2 Monte Carlo Simulation Flow 
A statistical model based on a Monte Carlo (MC) approach is developed to 
calculate the number of traps (N) and entire Vt distributions. A Monte Carlo 
flowchart is shown in Fig. 1.8. In our MC simulation, a Poisson-distributed precursor 
number (M) in each device is assumed with a mean value of 24 in an 80nmx30nm 
device, which corresponds to a precursor density of 10
12 
cm
-2
 [25]. A sequence 
number (i) is assigned to each precursor in a device. The activation energy of each 
precursor is chosen according to the measured Eeff distribution in Fig. 1.4. A trapped 
charge creation time is then computed from Eq. (1.4). The simulated log(i) 
distributions are shown in Fig. 1.9. Each distribution has the same shape as the 
activation energy. Due to a significant overlap of the distributions, some precursors 
with a larger sequence number are converted to a trapped charge earlier than the ones 
with a smaller i. Thus, we re-order trapped charge creation sequence number in each 
device. The i distributions after the re-ordering are shown in Fig. 1.10. The measured 
result is also shown in the figure for comparison. Two points should be noted. First, 
after the re-ordering, the standard deviation of log(i) decreases with an increasing i. 
This feature is consistent with the measurement result in Table 1.1. Second, The shape 
of the log(i) distribution with i=1 is least affected by the re-ordering. Consequently, 
we used the measured result of 1 to extract an Eeff distribution in Fig. 1.4.

develop a statistical model to simulate an NBTI induced Vt distribution in small area 
devices. The correlation between an activation energy distribution and an NBTI Vt 
distribution has been established. Our model can reproduce the measurement results 
of an NBTI Vt distribution and its stress time evolutions well.

Statistical Characterization and Modeling of a Vt 
Distribution and Its Temporal Evolutions in NBTI Recovery 
                        
2.1 Preface 
Unlike most reliability issues, NBTI Vt degradation recovers partly after the 
removal of stress [26]. Several circuit techniques exploiting NBTI recovery have been 
proposed to alleviate NBTI severity in memory and logic circuits [27][28]. To 
improve a design window that is tightened by several variability sources, the 
integration of NBTI degradation and recovery characteristics into a circuit simulation 
is called for in modern CMOS technology [29]. Hence, underlying degradation and 
recovery mechanisms of NBTI must be understood in order to make a meaningful 
projection of a device/circuit lifetime. While the reaction-diffusion (RD) model 
[10]-[12] are commonly adopted for NBTI degradation, no consensus regarding NBTI 
recovery mechanisms has been reached. Hydrogen back-diffusion in the framework of 
the RD model was first proposed to explain a NBTI recovery phenomenon [12]. A 
threshold voltage shift relaxation of the form of 0 0( ) (0)(1 / 2 / 1 / )t tV t V t t t t     
is anticipated from the back diffusion theory. Wang et al used a fast transient 
technique to characterize NBTI recovery and found a log(t) dependence of Vt on 
relaxation time in a time span from 10
-3
s to 10
2
s [30]. Moreover, they characterized 
individual trapped hole emissions in small-area devices and proposed a thermally 
assisted charge tunnel detrapping (ThAT) model for a recoverable component in 
relaxation [30][31]. A log(t) dependence was also reported in [32] where the authors 
26 
 
The DUTs are the same as the devices described in Chapter 1. The devices are 
first stressed at Vg=−1.8V for 100sec at room temperature. The recovery 
characterization scheme is similar to our previous work [21], i.e., in a 
relaxation-measurement-relaxation sequence. Both NBT stress and post-NBT 
recovery characterizations are performed at room temperature. In measurement phase, 
the drain voltage is −0.05V and the gate voltage is chosen such that the pre-stress 
drain current is about 500nA. Drain current variations are recorded using Agilent 
B1500. A corresponding Vt trace is obtained from a measured Id divided by a 
transconductance [35]. Fig. 2.1 shows example Id and Vt traces in NBTI relaxation. 
Each abrupt Vt change (vt,i) in the trace is due to a single trapped hole emission, 
where i denotes a charge detrapping sequence number. We collect all vt,i in about 
170 devices. The magnitude distributions of vt,1, vt,2 and all collected vt are 
plotted in Fig. 2.2. Emitted trapped charges have almost the same vt distribution 
regardless of a sequence number, or in other words, emitted charges are independent 
with respect to vt. The solid line in Fig. 2.2 represents an exponential distribution fit, 
f(|vt|)=exp(−|vt|/r/r with a r of 3.3mV. The origins and the distribution of the vt 
have been studied thoroughly and the exponential distribution is realized due to a 
random substrate dopant induced current path percolation effect [14][16]. 
 
2.2.2 Trapped Charge Emission Times 
Individual trapped charge emission times, for example, 1, 2 and 3 in Fig. 2.1, 
are clearly defined. We measure the first three emitted charge characteristic times (i, 
i=1,2,3). The emission characteristic times scatter over several decades of time. The 
probability density functions (PDFs) of the log(i), i=1,2,3, are shown in Fig. 2.3. The 
mean (<log(i)>) and the standard deviation (i) of the distributions are indicated in 
28 
 
and Et is a trapped charge energy. Other variables have their usual definitions in [31]. 
The hole tunneling mass used in this work is mIL
*
=0.41m0 [36] and mHK
*
=0.18m0 [37]. 
According to Eq. (2.1), a tunneling front moves in a speed of d=2.3/k per decade of 
time. A removable trapped charge density (Nt) in relaxation therefore can be extracted 
from the emission occurrence number versus log() in Fig. 2.4 as follows, 
 
 
(2.2) 
 
Since the number of emitted charges exhibits a uniform distribution 
approximately in each decade of time in Fig. 2.4, we obtain a constant removable 
trapped charge density Nt in space. With respect to a trapped charge energy 
distribution, we calculated a voltage drop across an interfacial oxide in NBTI stress by 
a numerical device simulation [38]. The voltage drop is about 0.8V at a stress Vg of 
−1.8V. We therefore assume that removable trapped holes are uniformly distributed in 
an energy range of 0 to 0.8eV above the Si valence band-edge, corresponding to an Et 
value of 2.7eV to 3.5eV with respect to the valence band-edge of the HfSiON. This 
assumption is also adopted in [39] and is supported partly by a charge pumping 
measurement result [40]. Fig. 2.5 illustrates a removable trapped charge distribution 
and a band diagram in recovery. The calculated value of k is from 7.2 to 8.1nm
-1
. For 
simplicity, we used an average 
k  (=7.65nm
-1
) in Eq. (2.2) and obtain an Nt of 
1.3x10
18
cm
-3
. An average distance (x) between two adjacent trapped charges in the 
gate-to-substrate direction is about x=1/WLNt ~0.32nm. 
In addition, the ratio of the emission times of two consecutive emitted trapped 
charges is

i=1, and the second nearest one has i=2 and so on. The Et of a trapped charge is 
randomly selected in a range from 2.7eV to 3.5eV, as explained above. The extracted 
Ea distributions from 1, 2, and 3, respectively, are shown in Fig. 2.6. An excellent 
match between the two Ea distributions of i=2 and i=3 is obtained. This excellent 
match ascertains Eq. (2.4) and the ThAT model. It should be remarked that the 
distortion of the Ea distribution of i=1 is understood because our recovery 
measurement starts with a time delay of 5ms. Thus, some emitted charges with very 
short  (< 5ms) are not counted. In Fig. 2.6, an appropriate 0 is chosen such that the 
mean of an Ea distribution (~0.5eV) is consistent with published results in literature 
[17]. The solid line in Fig. 2.6 represents a Gaussian distribution fit with a mean of 
0.5eV and a standard deviation of 0.08eV. To explain the broadening of the log(i) 
with a sequence number i in Fig. 2.3, we re-arrange the terms in Eq. (2.4) and obtain 
the following equation: 
 
(2.5) 
 
As i increases, the tunneling distance xi is larger and the variance of the term 
(kxi) in the right hand side increases and so does the variance of log(i). The 
broadening of the log(i) distribution with a sequence number i in recovery is a salient 
feature of the ThAT model with the spread of trapped charge energy. This feature is 
predicted from Eq. (2.5) and verified by the measurement result in Fig. 2.3. 
The dependence of a hole emission time on recovery temperature is characterized. 
The temperature study is somewhat difficult because some of NBTI traps might be 
annealed at high temperatures. For this reason, we chose a single-NBTI trap device. 
We take an average of 1 from ten measurements on the same device by repeatedly

the same direct tunneling equation as our model, i.e., no electric field dependence). 
The modified equation of c is valid for a trap with energy within the Si band-gap (e.g., 
an RTN trap). In NBTI recovery, a hole trap with energy above the silicon valence 
band-edge might have been filled because of a large stress Vg applied before recovery. 
In our manuscript, we point out that NBTI trapped holes have energy in a range of 
0~0.8eV above the Si valence band edge. To deal with those traps in NBTI recovery, 
the capture time

  , where E is an energy 
difference between a trap level and the valence bandedge, as illustrated in Fig. 2.8. 
Since E has the same field dependence as Eq. (2.6), it cancels out the term 
exp(xF/VT) in Eq. (2.6) and leaves e independent of an electric field. The outcome is 
the same as our model based on direct tunneling. The measurement result (Fig. 6 in 
our paper [31], and Fig. 7 in IMEC’s paper [33]) also does not support an exponential 
field dependence in NBTI recovery. Moreover, electric field is a secondary effect in 
our model.  
 
2.3 Modeling of a Recovery Vt Distribution 
2.3.1 Measured NBTI Induced VT Distribution 
We measure threshold voltage shifts in a large number of devices at different 
recovery times. The number of emitted holes and a total threshold voltage shift (Vt) 
in each device are recorded. Fig. 2.9 shows the measurement results at a recovery time 
of 0.1sec, 10sec and 1000sec. The y-axis is a total Vt and the x-axis is the number of 
emitted holes. Each data point represents a device. The measurement results scatter 
34 
 
its temporal evolution in small-area devices. In short, the log(t) behavior is a result of 
a uniform spatial distribution of trapped charges while the Ea and Et distributions 
affect a Vt distribution and its temporal evolution in small-area devices. 
 
2.4 Summary 
 We use a statistical approach to exploring NBTI recovery mechanisms and 
trapped charge characteristics. Thermally-assisted trapped charge tunnel emission has 
been confirmed to be a major mechanism in NBTI recovery. We extract a trapped 
charge activation energy distribution in the ThAT model for the first time. We find that 
the emission time distribution of trapped charges broadens as a sequence number 
increases. This feature is successfully explained by the ThAT model and verified by 
measurement. A Monte Carlo based statistical model for a post-NBTI Vt distribution 
is developed for small area devices. Our model can predict a Vt distribution and its 
temporal evolution in relaxation very well.

Ultra-High-Speed Transport Studies of One-Dimensional 
Electrons 
                      
3.1 Preface 
To achieve very high speed performance and very high component density, it is 
expected to move toward lower dimensional devices. Various advanced quantum-wire 
structures have been invented to realize the speed advantage of one-dimensional 
electron gas (1DEG) [41]-[43]. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown 
the possibility that the mobility of the low-dimensional electrons can be greatly 
enhanced due to the quantum-mechanical confinement effects [41][44]. It is 
interesting to investigate the 1DEG transport properties in quantum-wire structures. 
The quantum confinement effect on 1DEG wave-functions, sub-band structures, and 
electron-phonon scattering models are particularly evaluated. 
In this chapter, we develop a computer simulation code based on the 
quantum-mechanical consideration of electronic behaviors in quantum wires. We are 
also to investigate the quantum structure geometrical effects on 1DEG mobility. The 
basic structure of quantum wires has two confined directions y and z. The 1DEG 
quantum wire structure in this work, as described in Fig. 3.1, is designed to have 
intrinsic GaAs, a smaller bandgap material, embedded in a rectangular area (Ly × Lz) 
confined by wider bandgap material Al0.3Ga0.7As. In order to evaluate the 1DEG 
eigen-functions and eigen-energies, the 2D Schrödinger equation are solved. The 
electron-phonon interaction includes polar optical-phonon and acoustic-phonon 
scattering. Here we consider only bulk (i.e., 3D) phonon modes and neglect 1D and 
50 
 
wave-functions in a rectangular wire. The 1DEG wave-functions thus can be 
expressed in the form 
 
                          (3.2) 
 
where φ represents the electron envelope wave-function in the quantization 
directions, Lx is the length of a quantum wire, and kx is the electron wave vector 
component along the quantum wire. 
    Using the wave-functions in Eq. (3.2), the square of the matrix element between 
the mth sub-band and the nth sub-band for the 1DEG is given by  
 
         (3.3) 
 
where M3D is the corresponding matrix element for a bulk electron and q is a phonon 
wave vector. The overlap integral Imn in the above equations is defined as 
 
 (3.4) 
 
The Fröhlich Hamiltonian of the POP scattering in a one-dimensional system is 
given by [19], [26] 
 
                                                                 (3.5) 
 
where  is the angular frequency of longitudinal polar optical-phonon, qx is the 
longitudinal- phonon wave vectors and qy,qz are the transverse-phonon wave vectors,

where K0 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order 0. Then, the 1D 
scattering rates from an electron state kx in initial sub-band n to a state kx
’
 in final 
sub-band m are calculated according to the Fermi-Golden rule as 
 
 
                                                               (3.11a)

                                             (3.11b) 
 
Here N is the phonon occupation number with the ± corresponding to phonon 
emission or absorption, and ℏ is polar optical-phonon energy. Other variables have 
their usual definitions. Because the density of states in 1DEG systems has the 
singularity at the energy around the bottom of each sub-band, a Lorentzain- 
broadening fact was used, as Leburton et al. did [48], to smooth out the divergence in 
the scattering rate. A similar broadening factor was also used for 
deformation-potential acoustic-phonon scattering. 
    Acoustic-phonon scattering in 1DEG systems is treated similarly to polar 
optical-phonon scattering. The Hamiltonian of the ACP scattering in a 
one-dimensional system takes the form [49][50]

3.3 1DEG Monte Carlo Simulation 
A one-dimensional single-particle Monte Carlo method is adopted for our 
transport investigation. In quantum wires, the total scattering rate in the nth sub-band 
is expressed as n(kn(t)), that is, 
 
                                                                (3.16) 
 
where i denotes scattering event (forward and backward scattering due to POP 
emission, POP absorption, or interaction with ACP) and m is a sub-band index. For a 
given sub-band n, the free-flight time tf is therefore given by 
 
                                            (3.17) 
 
with the uniformly distributed random number r from 0 to 1. The program 
approximates the integral as a sum and moves the electron in uniform energy steps of 
size E from an initial energy Ei until a final energy Ef is found such that 
 
                                     (3.18a)

systems, the distribution function approaches the Boltzmann distribution when Fx 
diminishes. The system will be in the equilibrium state without any external force. 
 
3.4 1DEG Mobility in AlGaAs/GaAs Quantum Wire Structures 
Because of the reduction of phase space, the number of available final states in 
the scattering process (only forward or backward scattering) is very limited. This 
results in an enhancement of 1D mobility with respect to the bulk and 2DEG mobility. 
The 1DEG quantum wire structure in this work is designed to have a rectangular 
geometry. Fig. 3.5 shows the calculated 1DEG mobility in various quantum wires. 
The highest mobility of 9200cm
2
/V-s is obtained in a 110Å  × 110Å  quantum wire. 
This value is greater than the maximum mobility of 8600 cm
2
/V-s in the rectangular 
quantum well and the bulk electron mobility of 8000 cm
2
/V-s in intrinsic GaAs. Fig. 
3.6 re-plots the 1DEG mobility against the energy separation between E0 and E1 with 
Ly = Lz. The 1DEG mobility varies from 7050 cm
2
/V-s in a 70Å  × 70Å  wire to 9200 
cm
2
/V-s in a 110Å  × 110Å  wire. It should be pointed out that the occurrence of the 
mobility peak at E1-E0=2ℏ in Fig. 3.6 is even clearer in a quantum wire. The reason 
is that the 1DEG distribution function has a steeper drop at E0+ℏ due to the 
enhanced POP emission as shown in Fig. 3.4. The scattering rates of 1DEG, 2DEG, 
and bulk electrons are shown in Fig. 3.7 for a comparison. Apparently, the 1DEG 
scattering rate has a largest POP emission rate at E=E0+ℏarising from the 
singularity of the 1DEG density of states. Below the POP emission threshold, the 
1DEG scattering rate is lower than the 2DEG and the bulk electrons for the limited 
density of states, while at high energies the 1DEG and 2DEG scattering rates 
approach to the bulk value.

Dynamics of One-dimensional Electron Gas 
                      
4.1 Preface 
In this chapter, we will introduce the electron-POP scattering mechanism in 
QWWs. Both bulk POP model and confined longitudinal optical phonon (LO) model 
are explained and compared. Electron-ACP scattering is also investigated for 
completeness. 
 
4.2 Bulk POP scattering  
Phonon modes in bulk POP model are supposed to be immune from the space 
confinement arising from finite wire dimensions. For a given phonon occupation 
number Nq, the 3-D phonon wave vector q, and the phonon frequency , the Fröhlich 
Hamiltonian that stands for the energy barrier of electron-POP interaction can be 
readily written as [52] 
 
(4.1)  
 
where aq is the phonon annihilation operator and aq
+
, the creation operator. The 
constant C in Eq. (4.1) is  
 
                                                                 (4.2)

around the bottom of each sub-band. A constant broadening factor was chosen, as 
Leburton et al. did [48], to avoid the divergence. 
The scattering rates described above can be arranged into the following simple 
expression for our evaluation, that is, 
 
 
                                                              (4.5) 
 
with 
 
 
                              (4.6) 
 
where K0 is the Bessel’s function of order zero. The intra-sub-band scattering rates of 
ground state for different quantum wire structures are calculated and shown in Fig. 4.1. 
The scattering rates decrease as the wire area increase. It is from the diminution of 
overlap integral in the scattering rate calculation when the wire dimensions are 
expended. In other words, there are more final states in the same sub-band after 
scattering if the quantum wire becomes smaller. The probability of forward scattering 
will be larger than that of backward scattering for higher electron energy, as shown in 
Fig. 4.2. It is obvious that particles with larger momentum will keep on their traveling 
directions mostly after collision as a result of momentum conservation.

mechanical discontinuity between the two adjacent materials. Then the guided phonon 
modes have vibration amplitudes as 
 
                                                              (4.8) 
 
This model satisfies the boundary conditions for atomic displacements. In the 
long-wavelength modes, q /L, this model will agree with the microscopic model 
[57]. However, this model gives unreasonable boundary conditions in the 
electromagnetic points of view. So the macroscopic models (both EM and HD models) 
cannot properly describe the real behaviors of confined LO phonons though they are 
simply formulated. 
 
4.3.2 Microscopic Models 
The microscopic model of electron-optical phonon interaction in quantum wells 
was initially proposed by Huang and Zhu [58][59], and was reviewed and compared 
with anther model developed by Rűcker et al. [60]. It has been applied to quantum 
wire systems recently [61]. A basic assumption is taken at first that the oppositely 
charged lattice particles oscillate in the simple-cubic lattice. Secondly, the intrinsic 
oscillator frequencies of the two materials A and B, that is, 0(A) and 0(B), have the 
relationship  It implies that materials A and B have the same 
bulk phonon dispersions apart from a rigid shift of . For a quantum wire with 
dimension Ly=Na and Lz=Ma (a is the lattice constant), the phonon modes can be 
derived by the eigen-value problem. The term  plays the role of the phonon 
potential barrier height. 
As we found in the calculation of electron states, eigen-functions in the y-z plane 
 
 

                      (4.12b) 
 
so we have 
 
                                        (4.12c) 
 
Some lower mode of the confined LO phonons are extracted and shown in Fig. 
4.3. The mode n=1 (m=1) does not include, since it is a half-wavelength mode that 
can’t agree with our requirement in boundary conditions. As a matter of fact, this 
mode becomes an interface mode. The interface phonons are important when the well 
dimensions decrease to the order of tens of angstroms. These modes are left for later 
discussion. 
Since the microscopic model satisfies both EM and HD boundary conditions, it 
is the most reasonable model developed hitherto. We will use it to execute the 
transport simulation later on. 
 
4.4 Interface LO-phonons 
Beside the confined LO phonons, there are phonon modes corresponding to the 
vibration of interface discontinuities. They are so-called interface phonons. It is 
obvious that the interface vibration will blow up in the heavily confined area. That is 
to say, when the confined region is reduced to some critical dimensions, the 
interaction of electrons and interface modes will become the dominant effect in 
electron-phonon scattering. 
The evaluation of microscopic model gives us phonon modes mixing together,

electron-POP scattering rates under quantum effects can be derived just like we did 
without phonon quantization. The scattering rate  is expressed as 
 
 
 (4.15) 
 
where 
 
                      (4.16) 
 
with the overlap integral Ffi (wave function from sub-band i to sub-band f) containing 
the lattice potential function mn. That is, 
 
                                (4.17) 
 
  The scattering rates calculated for some special dimensions are shown in Fig. 4.4. 
It is obvious that the scattering rates increase as the wire area extended. This 
phenomenon is totally different from bulk phonon model which has higher scattering 
rates for higher confinements. 
Electron-interface phonon scattering rates are also evaluated by the same 
procedure. We use s and A instead of mn in Eq. (4.17) to decide the overlap 
integral, and evaluate the scattering rates from Eq. (4.15) and Eq. (4.16). The 
scattering rates calculated reveal that the interface phonon effect is comparable with 
confined-LO phonon scattering rates around 70Å ×70Å  becomes dominant effect for 
area smaller than 50Å ×50Å .

Study of Quantum Confinement Effects on Hole Mobility in 
Silicon and Germanium Double Gate MOSFETs 
                        
5.1 Preface 
Double-gate (DG) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors 
(MOSFETs) and fin field-effect-transistor have been considered as promising 
alternatives to bulk MOSFETs in 22nm technology node and beyond
 
due to their 
immunity to short channel effects. Recently, advanced channel materials with higher 
carrier mobility than bulk Si, such as Ge, and III-V materials, have attracted much 
attention. Experimental works have shown the possibility that the inversion carrier 
mobility can be further improved in quantum structure MOSFETs by a sub-band 
modulation [67][68]. However, there has been little work on Ge-channel 
DG-pMOSFETs addressing valence sub-band and substrate/channel orientation 
effects on hole mobility.  
In this work, we analyze quantum confinement effects on hole mobility as a 
function of a body thickness in Si- and Ge-channel DG-pMOSFETs. The low-field 
hole mobility is calculated by a Monte Carlo method [69]. The role of quantum 
confinement effects in a Ge-channel is compared with a Si-channel with a valence 
sub-band calculation. The impact of substrate orientation on hole mobility is also 
evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of uni-axial compressive stress is discussed.

For instance, it is believed that the [110] channel direction is the primarily used 
channel direction in strained-Si technologies because of its largest hole 
piezoresistance coefficient for longitudinal compressive stress on both (100) and (110) 
substrates [79]. The [ ] and ( ) are the notations of channel direction and substrate 
orientation, respectively. As an uni-axial stress is applied to the (100)/[110] direction,

5.3.1 Schrodinger Equation with a Six-band Luttinger Hamiltonian 
 The valence sub-bands in an inversion layer can be solved by obtaining the 
self-consistent solution to the Poisson and Schrödinger equations under the 
framework of a six-band Luttinger Hamiltonian, instead of using the effective mass 
approximation. In the simulation, we take the coordinate z to be the direction 
perpendicular to the semiconductor and gate dielectric interface. The Schrödinger 
equation can be expressed as Eq. (5.13).

assumed in the simulation. The finite difference method is employed for the

the Poisson equation where the carrier concentrations are computed by a Fermi 
integral. Then, the potential energy takes into account the potential due to the free 
charges and ionized impurities, due to the image force from different dielectric 
constant between the gate dielectric and semiconductor, and due to the many-body 
corrections (exchange and correlation effects) [83]. We assume that the image force 
cancels many-body corrections in a bulk inversion layer, as reported in literature [84]. 
As a consequence, the potential energy includes the contribution only from the first 
term in our simulation. Then, with the sub-band energies and wave-functions obtained 
from the Schrödinger equation, the two-dimensional carrier concentrations can be 
updated. Note that we assume the wave-function penetration into the gate dielectric is 
zero. The subsequent iteration will yield the final self-consistent solution when the 
error criteria are met. 
  
5.4 Monte Carlo Model 
Material parameters of Si and Ge, including Luttinger parameters, deformation 
potentials, and elastic constants used in the simulation, are given in Table 5.1 
[85]-[87]. Relevant scattering mechanisms, including acoustic phonon scattering and 
optical phonon scattering, and surface roughness scattering, are considered in the 
simulation [88]-[91]. The scattering-matrix elements are approximated, such that 
phonon scattering can be considered as velocity randomizing. For an acoustic phonon, 
the scattering rate can be expressed as

effective mass, S(Q) is the power spectrum of the roughness at the interface, Q is the 
magnitude of wave-vector change.  is the correlation length and is the average 
step height. Table 5.1 shows the scattering parameters of Si and Ge, which are 
calibrated from a conventional Si MOSFET and from a SiGe-on-insulator device, 
respectively [90].  
In the numerical implementation of the valence sub-band structure in a Monte 
Carlo simulation, a tabular form of the E-k relationship is established. Only 
eigen-values for k|| <0.6π/a, which significantly contribute to the low-field channel 
mobility, are evaluated [92]. A flowchart of the Monte Carlo simulation can be 
referred to [69]. In the simulation, a single hole is simulated under an external electric 
field. It travels freely between two successive scatterings. The free-flight time is 
determined by using a fixed time technique. During the free flight, the hole is 
accelerated by the field and its momentum and energy are updated according to the 
tabular form of the E-k relationship. If a scattering happens, a random number, 0~1, is 
then generated to decide the responsible scattering mechanism and sub-band index. 
Then, the new hole state is chosen according to the sorted E-k relationship. This 
procedure is continued until the mobility fluctuation due to the statistical error is less 
than 0.5%. 
 
5.5 Hole Mobility in silicon and germanium double-gate MOSFETs 
5.5.1 Sub-band Structures in (100) Si- and Ge-channels 
 Fig. 5.3 shows the simulated device configuration. The inversion hole density, 
pinv, is set to be 4×10
12
cm
-2
. The 2D hole density of a 15nm Ge-channel is drawn. The 
wave-functions of a 10nm Si-channel and a 15nm Ge-channel are also depicted in Fig. 
5.4. In Fig. 5.4, the first sub-band of Si-channel is the heavy hole sub-band, which is 
 94 
of a mobility peak in a Ge-channel. Moreover, the calculated hole mobility at 
TGe=28nm is about 617 cm
2
/Vs, which deviates from the bulk value of Ge. This is due 
to larger phonon deformation potentials in a MOSFET than in a bulk material, 
resulting from stress at gate dielectric and semiconductor interface [94].  
The turn-around behavior of the hole mobility in a Ge-channel can be explained 
in the two following aspects: overlap integral and energy separation between 
sub-bands. As a body thickness decreases, the energy difference,E, between the first 
sub-band (heavy hole band) and the second sub-band (heavy hole band) increases 
owing to quantum confinement effects, as shown in Fig. 5.4 and Fig. 5.7. Because of 
less chance to be scattered to the second sub-band, inversion holes have a larger 
mobility owing to a smaller inter-subband scattering rate. On the other side, the 
intra-subband scattering rate increases due to an increase of an overlap integral. The 
confinement effect on the overlap integral can be understood from the illustration in 
Fig. 5.8. When a smaller body thickness is considered, the wave-function has a wider 
distribution in momentum space due to the uncertainty principle. For a fixed phonon 
momentum in the quantized direction qz, only the shaded region in Fig. 5.8 
contributes to the overlap integral. A broader distribution in momentum space results 
in a larger overlap factor (Fig. 5.7) and thus a larger intra-subband scattering rate. The 
interplay between inter-subband and intra-subband scatterings opens a window of a 
body thickness where the scattering rates can be minimized, giving rise to a peak in 
hole mobility, as shown in Fig. 5.6. Unlike a Ge-channel, the lowest two sub-bands in 
a (100)/[110] Si-channel are heavy-hole and light-hole bands (see Fig. 5.4), 
respectively, due to the high degree of degeneracy of heavy and light holes in Si [68]. 
For a decreasing well thickness, the larger energy separation reduces hole population 
in the light-hole sub-band and leads to a decrease of hole mobility. 
 96 
is comparable due to the same bulk piezoresistance coefficients [95]. For a smaller 
body thickness, the quantum confinement effect plays a role and the energy difference 
from the uni-axial compressive stress and surface field is additive, which is 
responsible for the slight shift of the peak mobility. 
 
5.6 Summary 
The effects of channel/substrate orientation and uni-axial compressive stress 
on hole mobility versus body thickness in Ge-channel DG-pMOSFETs are 
investigated. The peak mobility in both (100)/[110] and (110)/[-110] channel 
directions can be achieved at a certain body thickness due to the interplay between 
inter-subband and intra-subband scatterings. Furthermore, it is found that the hole 
mobility can be further improved when the uni-axial compressive stress is applied to 
(100)/[110] or (110)/[-110] channel direction. These findings would play a significant 
role for the design of the Ge-channel DG-pMOSFETs.
