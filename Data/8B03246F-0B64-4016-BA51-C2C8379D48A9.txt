2temperature [5-9, 13-14], or even at -2 ºC [5].  In a Cu-Sn diffusion couple experiment, the Cu was 
shown to be the dominant diffusing species at lower temperature as the inert marker was displaced 
toward the Cu side [6], and the rapid diffusion was due to an interstitial diffusion mechanism [15]. 
Experimentally, Cu was also observed to diffuse rapidly into Sn [8, 10, 14].  Kinetic studies showed 
that the growth of η′-Cu6Sn5 followed the parabolic law [6, 16], and the activation energy of growth 
was reported [6, 9, 11, 16].  However, a linear growth rate of η′-Cu6Sn5 was also reported at room 
temperature [6] and 80 ºC [10].
The ε-Cu3Sn phase was observed to form between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu in the annealing process at 
150 ºC for 5 min [17], 100 ºC for 2 hours [8], 85 ºC for 6 hours [10], or as low as 60 ºC [5] or 50 ºC [6] 
for unspecified time.  No ε-Cu3Sn was observed to form at room temperature for up to one year [5].  
The higher interdiffusivity in η′-Cu6Sn5 than that in ε-Cu3Sn results in the dominance of η′-Cu6Sn5 in 
the initial stage [16].
In spite of the large amount of research in this field, only recently the orientation relationships 
between η-Cu6Sn5 and Cu were determined by a synchrotron micro-x-ray diffraction experiment by 
Suh et al. [3, 18].  The η-Cu6Sn5 phase was formed by a reflow process above 200 ºC and the specimen 
was quenched to room temperature to retain the η-Cu6Sn5 phase.  Zou et al. [19] used Cu single crystal 
surface to react with molten Sn at 260 ºC and the specimens were air-cooled to room temperature to 
form the η′-Cu6Sn5 phase.  The orientation relationships between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu, analyzed by SEM 
electron backscattered diffraction, were determined to be (010)η′//(001)Cu, (102)η′//(001)Cu, (on the 
(001)Cu surface), and (010)η′//(111)Cu, (102)η′//(111)Cu, (on the (111)Cu surface).  No orientation 
relationship was found on the (011)Cu and (123)Cu surfaces.
The first purpose of this research is to study the crystallographic orientation relationships between 
η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Since the η′-Cu6Sn5 layer formed by 
the reflow and annealing process was generally too thick to be electron transparent, in this experiment 
it was formed by a solid-state thin-film reaction between Cu and Sn at low temperature.  Epitaxial Cu 
thin films were formed by evaporating Cu onto the (001), (011) and (111) surfaces of NaCl single 
crystal and then Sn was evaporated to form η′-Cu6Sn5 directly without breaking the vacuum.  The 
advantages of TEM are that the orientation relationships and the interfaces can be determined easily by  
electron diffraction.
Another purpose of this paper is to study the microstructure of η′-Cu6Sn5 in the early stage of 
growth.  For this purpose the above Cu film can not be used because both its grain size and thickness 
are less than ~100 nm, very different from the Cu pads used in soldering.  Thin Cu foils were used and 
Sn were electroplated onto them to form a η′-Cu6Sn5 layer.  Both surfaces of the η′-Cu6Sn5 layer were 
studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by removing the Cu and Sn from the η′-Cu6Sn5 
surfaces electrolytically.  The η′-Cu6Sn5 specimens were also thin enough for direct TEM observation 
and, with its superior resolution, more detailed analysis of microstructure was possible. 
2. Experimental Details
2.1 Electroplation specimens
To study the microstructure of η′-Cu6Sn5, Cu foil (99.9% pure) 0.1 mm thick was used.  The foil 
was annealed at 900 ºC for 5 hours in a vacuum furnace of about 1 × 10-2 Pa to increase the grain size 
to 20~30 µm.  The foil was then cut into 2 cm × 6 cm rectangles, degreased with acetone, and dipped 
into a 10 vol% H2SO4 + 90 vol% H2O solution for 15 s to remove the surface oxide.  After rinsing with 
de-ionized water, the Cu foil was immediately electroplated with Sn (99.97% pure).  
Methanesulphonic acid-based aqueous bath was used and the electroplation process was performed at 
room temperature for 180 s at an operating voltage of 4 V and a current of 3 A to obtain a Sn coating 
4grain (the grain size of the Cu foil is 20~30 µm).  The SAD patterns of Figs. 2a and 2c strongly suggest 
that an epitaxial orientation relationship exist between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu, as will to be shown later.
3.2. Evaporation specimens
Figs. 3a, 3b, and 3c are the XRD patterns of the specimens prepared on the NaCl (100), (111), and 
(110) surfaces, respectively.  These figures indicate that epitaxial Cu films were successfully prepared.  
Enlarged patterns shown as insets in Figs. 3a and 3b are to show more clearly the presence of the (204) 
η′-Cu6Sn5 peak, although no η′-Cu6Sn5 peak is observed in Fig. 3c.  No other Cu-Sn phase could be 
detected.
Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c are the SAD patterns of IMC and Cu formed on the NaCl (001), (111), and 
(011) surfaces, respectively.  In Fig. 4a, the SAD pattern is indexed to consist of the epitaxial Cu film 
in the [001] zone axis and two variants of η′-Cu6Sn5 in the [204] zone axis, consistent with the XRD 
pattern in Fig. 3a.  Fig. 3a also shows that an epitaxial orientation relationship exists between the η′-
Cu6Sn5 and Cu, i.e., Z = [204]η′ = [001]Cu, η′//(110)Cu, and (020)η′ // Cu (variant 1).  The 
variant 2 has an equivalent orientation relationship but with a 90° rotation.  This orientation 
relationship is designated as type 1.  In addition, the η′-Cu6Sn5 diffraction pattern in Fig. 4a is the same 
as that in Fig. 2b formed by electroplating Sn on Cu foil.  Therefore the Cu grain in Fig. 2b, which was 
completely etched away, can be inferred to have a (001) surface.
In Fig. 4b the pattern of the epitaxial Cu film is in the [111] zone axis but the η′-Cu6Sn5 pattern is 
still in the same [204] zone axis as that in Fig. 4a, although there are now three variants.  The result is 
consistent with the XRD pattern in Fig. 3b.  The epitaxial orientation relationship, designated as type 
2, is Z = [204]η′ = [111]Cu, η′ // Cu, and (020)η′ // Cu (variant 1).  The variants 2 and 3 have 
an equivalent orientation relationship but with successive 120º rotations.
In Fig. 4c the pattern of the epitaxial Cu film is in the [110] zone axis, but the η′-Cu6Sn5 pattern is 
not in any exact zone axis and can not be indexed.  The result is also consistent with the XRD pattern 
in Fig. 3c.  After tilting the specimen around the [001]Cu axis for 35° to reach the Cu [111] zone axis, 
the SAD pattern in Fig. 5, which is the same as Fig. 4b, was obtained.  Therefore the orientation 
relationship in Fig. 4c is actually the same as the type 2 on the (111)Cu surface but not anything on the 
(110)Cu surface.  The reason for this will be explained in Discussion.
Figs. 6a, 6b and 6c are the BFI, the DFI of Cu, and the DFI of η′-Cu6Sn5, respectively, formed 
with the corresponding diffraction spots in the SAD pattern in Fig. 4a (Z = [001]Cu).  The epitaxial Cu 
film in Fig. 6b is a continuous film with many cracks.  Fig. 6c shows that many η′-Cu6Sn5 grains are 
extremely small, similar to Fig. 2e and 2f, while some can grow to 100 nm.  Similar results are 
obtained from Figs. 6d, 6e, and 6f, which are the BFI, the DFI of Cu, and the DFI of η′-Cu6Sn5, 
respectively, formed with the corresponding diffraction spots in the SAD patterns in Fig. 4b (Z = [111]
Cu).
 
4. Discussion
4.1 The orientation relationships and interfaces
    The orientation relationships between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu on the (001)Cu (Fig. 4a) and (111)Cu 
(Fig. 4b) surfaces are plotted in Figs. 7a and 7b, respectively.  In both cases the zone axis of η′-Cu6Sn5 
is the [204] η′ direction.  Since η′-Cu6Sn5 has a monoclinic structure, the [hkl] direction may not be 
perpendicular to the (hkl) plane, and the interfacial planes in Figs. 4a and 4b need to be calculated.  
Fig. 7c shows the (010) η′ plane which contains the [100] (ao=1.102 nm) and [001] axes (co=0.9827 
nm), and the [204] and  directions.  The (204) η′ and η′ planes are perpendicular to the (010)η′ 
6µm), and all those very fine η′-Cu6Sn5 grains have the same orientation relationship to the Cu grain 
although they may belong to different variants.  The interfaces between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu therefore 
can be low-energy coherent ones as discussed in Figs. 8 and 9.  However, it was also shown that 
considerable misfit strain is still present, and the misfit strain energy may increase rapidly with 
increasing contact area.  The grains can grow large very rapidly away from the interfaces toward the 
Sn side.
The η′-Cu6Sn5 grains on the Sn side are 0.1~0.3 µm in size (Fig. 1b), and the grains along the 
ridges, formed apparently along the Sn grain boundaries, are even larger and can reach 0.2~0.5 µm.  
Since the η′-Cu6Sn5 layer in Fig. 1 is electron transparent, its thickness can only be about several tens 
of nanometers.  This indicates a very rapid growth of η′-Cu6Sn5 grains and that a considerable amount 
of coalescence and coarsening occurs right after nucleation.  The η′-Cu6Sn5 grains have been shown to 
grow at room temperature [5, 6, 9, 12, 14], and grow rapidly at higher temperature due to the relatively 
low activation energy [6, 9, 11, 16].  Actually, after further annealing of our specimens at 150 ºC for 5 
min, the η′-Cu6Sn5 grains were observed to grow into scallop-type grains up to 1 µm in size (result not 
shown).  The formation of ridges along the Sn grain boundaries further confirms the rapid diffusion of 
Cu into Sn [8, 10, 14] along the Sn grain boundaries.
5. Conclusions
Sn was electroplated onto Cu at room temperature and the specimen was annealed at 150 ºC for 30 
s to develop the IMC which was identified to be η′-Cu6Sn5.  SEM and TEM analysis showed that η′-
Cu6Sn5 grains on the Cu side were as small as ~5 nm and nucleation occurred on this interface.  The 
grains grew rapidly to 0.1 to 0.3 µm toward the Sn side, and formed ridges into the Sn grain 
boundaries.
The orientation relationships between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu were found to be (1) [204]η′ // [001]Cu 
(zone axis), η′ // (110)Cu and (020) η′// Cu, and (2) [204]η′ // [111]Cu (zone axis), η′ // Cu 
and (020) η′// Cu.  In both cases, the η′ plane was found to align with the {110}Cu planes and 
the misfit between them was only -0.31%.  Two interfaces of (204)η′ / (001)Cu and (204)η′ / (111)Cu 
were identified.  Analysis showed a reasonable match of the Cu atoms in the above interfaces.  
However, the orientation relationship between η′-Cu6Sn5 and Cu on the (011)Cu surface was not 
obtained as the (011)Cu surface did not form by evaporation.
