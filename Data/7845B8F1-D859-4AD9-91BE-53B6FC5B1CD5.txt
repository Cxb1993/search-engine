英文摘要 
      Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has 
tremendous potential in both commercial and 
military applications and it is a fast emerging 
technology that promises the ability to perform 
various tasks related to the physical world. In all 
applications, the most important objective of the 
sensor network is to detect the event or the 
target, which may be either static or mobile. 
Besides, location of the nodes in a network in 
detecting the target, such as location of an 
earthquake survivor buried underneath rubble or 
latest position of an enemy vehicle in the battle 
field is a challenging research issue. In this 
project, a novel target tracking protocol and 
modeling of one hop sensors for analyzing the 
performance of the nodes are developed. The 
theoretical achievements of the project include 
(1) the sequential boundary node selection 
(SBNS) and distributed boundary node selection 
(DBNS) algorithms to find out the boundary 
nodes of the WSN with or without presence of 
 enclosing the following three kinds of regions: the 
monitoring region, sensing holes, and 
user-defined regions, as shown in Fig 1. 
 
 
Fig 1: Example of boundaries over the 
monitoring region. 
 
      We have developed the distributed boundary 
node algorithms, in which each node in the 
monitoring region could be classified into Boundary 
Node (BN) or Non-Boundary-Node (Non-BN), as 
shown in Fig 2. 
 
 
Fig. 2: BN and Non-BN nodes after the Initial 
Phase. 
 
Then, a pruning phase is developed to reset the 
redundant BNs to Non-BNs, as shown in Fig. 3. 
After selecting limited BNs and Non-BNs, we 
propose the target detection protocol by using 
the selected boundary nodes to detect the entry 
or exit time of a target over the monitoring 
region. 
 
 
 
Fig. 3: Pruning the redundant BN B. 
      As shown in Fig. 4, let the bold curved line 
represents the outer boundary of all BN’s 
sensing range. As soon as the target passes 
through the outer boundary, the time of entry or 
exit as detected by the BN is transmitted to the 
sink. Accordingly, there are two kinds of time 
stamps. 
 
 
 
Fig. 4: The network boundary 
 
      One is the target entering to the network, 
called Te; and the other one is the target leaving 
the network, called Tl. As shown in Fig. 5, when 
the tiger enters into the monitoring region, the 
BN X, first detects the target at time Te, and it 
broadcasts the Detect X message to its neighbors. 
Besides, it checks and finds its recording table is 
empty, and then sends the Entering Time (Te, X) 
to the sink. After the target leaves the BN X's 
sensing range, it broadcasts the Leave X packet 
and checks its recording table again. The time 
during BN X broadcasts the Leave X packet to its 
neighbors; Non-BN Y has already sent the Detect 
Y packet to the BN X.  So, BN X finds a 
non-empty field in its recording table and 
 Thus, the analytical model of the transition 
matrix for the backlogged nodes and the 
transmitting nodes is developed. 
四、計畫實現成果  
       The implementation of the project is mainly 
focused on the localization of a target, 
particularly considering a MOBILE MOTE [8], 
as a target. The achievements of the 
implementations are summarized as follows. 
 
A. Experimental Setups  
       In order to estimate the possible position of a 
target, a MOBILE MOTE [8] is considered as a 
target and its position at different instant of time 
is estimated. The mobile mote is allowed to 
move on an obstacle free two-dimensional 
smooth surface of area 25mX6M, as shown in 
Fig. 9.  The three MICAz are fixed on the roof at 
a constant distance of 3.6 meters from the 
surface, where the Mobile Mote can move. The 
distance between each sensor (MICAz) is 
maintained at a fixed distance of 6 meters from 
each other. All the sensors are placed along one 
straight line on the roof, as shown in Fig. 9. 
Another MICAz fitted with the programming 
board is placed at a distance of 5 meters from the 
last sensors fixed on the roof. The serial port 
RS-232 of the programming board fitted with 
this MICAz  is connected to the serial port 
RS-232 of the Note Book. All the information 
collected by different static sensors fixed on the 
roof are transmitted through it to the notebook. 
The notebook acts as a DATABASE (DB) to 
store the location information of the Mobile 
Mote time to time. The detail experimental setup 
of our implementation is shown in Fig. 9.

the estimation of location of a mobile target.  
 
B. Implementation Strategies  
 
       The whole implementation strategies are 
divided into three different parts, as shown 
below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Flow Diagram of the Implementation Strategies. 
 
1. Implementation at the Mobile Mote 
 
The Mobile Robot contains a MICAz and a 
motor. The motor moves over the obstacle free 
surface and the contained MICAz broadcasts the 
HELLO message in each 50 msec. The HELLO 
message contains ID of the Mobile MICAz.

the Mobile Robot. 
 
       The implementation in the Mobile Mote is 
done using the NesC compiler and the code is 
given below.

4. Implementation at the Database 
(Notebook) 
 
In order to store the position of the mobile 
target, we execute “XListen.exe” in the 
notebook with a SQL server. Once the 
“XListen.exe” is executed, the raw data is 
saved to DBTest.txt. Then we use JAVA 
SDK to read those raw data and save it to the 
SQL database. This JAVA code estimates 
the position of the target if it is nearer or 
farther to any static MICAz.

發明人/創作人 沙庫瑪 教授 
這個計畫中，我們已經完成如何不使用GPS去估計目標位置。
因為GPS很昂貴, 我們用Mobile Mote來當作目標, 讓它在平滑無
障礙物的表面上運動。一些固定在高處的其他感測器會不定時
的偵測目標位置,不用GPS而知道目標的相關位置。而估計位置
的詳細步驟在報告中的實作部份裡描述。 技術說明 
In this project we have implemented how to estimate the location of a 
target without help of any GPS. Since GPS is very expensive, we 
have used a Mobile Mote as a target, which moves over an obstacle 
free smooth surface. Some other sensors fixed on the roof detect the 
position of the target from time to time and relative location of the 
target is known without GPS. The detail location estimation 
procedure is described in the implementation part of our report.  
可利用之產業 
          及 
可開發之產品 
This property can be used for military surveillances, home security, 
banking and financial security to detect the entrance or exit of any 
person into the monitoring area.  
技術特點 
1. Detection of entry or exit of any target to the monitoring region.  
2. Estimation of position of the target with any GPS. 
推廣及運用的價值 
Since GPS is very expensive, it is not cost effective to use in wireless
sensor network. So, our implementation strategy can be applied to 
find the location of a target in wireless sensor network without GPS 
and can be popularized.
