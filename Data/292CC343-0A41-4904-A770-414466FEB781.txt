where [LSL, USL] is the specification interval, µ  is the process mean and σ  is the 
process standard deviation, ( ) / 2d USL LSL= −  and ( ) / 2M USL LSL= +  are half- 
length and midpoint of the specification interval, respectively. In quality assurance 
programs, PCIs can reflect the performance of key quality characteristics for an 
in-control process. For thorough discussions of different capability indices and their 
statistical properties see, e.g., the two monographs by Kotz and Johnson (1993) and 
Kotz and Lovelace (1998), and the review paper with discussions by Kotz and 
Johnson (2002). 
A process is said to have a symmetric tolerance if the target value T is set to be 
the midpoint of the specification interval [LSL, USL], i.e. T = M. Most research in 
quality assurance literature has focused on cases in which the manufacturing tolerance 
is symmetric. Recent research and advances made in this subject are Chan et al. 
(1988), Boyles (1991), Rodriguez (1992), Vännman (1995), Vännman and Kotz 
(1995), Spiring (1997), Pearn et al. (2004a, 2004b), and Wu and Pearn (2005) among 
many others. Granted that cases with symmetric tolerances are common in practical 
situations, cases with asymmetric tolerances, i.e. T M≠ , also often occur in the 
manufacturing industries. See Choi and Owen (1990), Boyles (1994), Vännman 
(1997), Chen (1998), Chen et al. (1999), and the more recent Jessenberger and Weihs 
(2000), Pearn et al. (2006) and Chang et al. (2007), and references therein.  
From the customer’s point of view, asymmetric tolerances reflect that deviations 
from the target are less tolerable in one direction than in the other (see Boyles (1994), 
Vännman (1997), and Wu and Tang (1998)). Usually they are not directly related to 
the shape of the supplier’s process distribution. Nevertheless, asymmetric tolerances 
can also arise in those situations where the tolerances are symmetric to begin with, but 
the process distribution is skewed or follows a non-normal distribution. Dealing with 
this, the data are usually transformed to achieve approximate normality, as shown by 
Chou et al. (1998) who have used the Johnson (1949) curves to transform non-normal 
process data.  
Several authors, including Kane (1986), Chan et al. (1988), Franklin and 
Wasserman (1992), Kushler and Hurley (1992) and Pearn and Chen (1998), have been 
devoted to handle processes with asymmetric tolerances for pkC  index and several 
generalizations of pkC , including 
*
pkC , pkC′ , pkC′′  have been proposed. Among 
them, *pkC  and pkC′  may understate or overstate the process capability in many 
cases, depending on the position of µ  relative to T . The index pkC′′  by Pearn and 
Chen (1998) is developed to remedy for this weakness. Also, they have investigated a 
thorough comparison among the three indices, pkC , pkC′  and pkC′′ . The results 
showed that pkC′′  is superior to other existing generalizations of pkC  for processes 
with asymmetric tolerances.

Evidently, if u lD D= , the specification tolerance becomes symmetric and the 
generalization *pkC  as expressed in Equation (2) reduces to the original pkC . Boyles 
(1994) noted that this generalization could underestimate the process capability by 
restricting the process to a proper subset of the actual specification range. 
2.2. The ′pkC  Index 
An alternative generalization suggested for processes with asymmetric tolerances 
shifts both specification limits to arrive at one that is symmetric (see Franklin and 
Wasserman (1992), Kushler and Hurley (1992)). This modification replaces the 
original specification limits ( , )l uT D T D− +  with the new symmetric limits T d ′± , 
where ( ) / 2l ud D D′ = + , and next applies the standard definition of pkC . For this 
generalization, the index pkC  can be modified as:

Evidently, if u lD D= , the specification tolerance becomes symmetric and pkC′  
defined in Equation (3) reduces to pkC . Boyles (1994) also observed that this 
approach could either understate or overstate the process capability, depending on the 
position of µ  relative to T . 
2.3. The ′′pkC  Index 
To remedy the situation, Pearn and Chen (1998) proposed another generalization 
of pkC , called the pkC′′  index, for processes with asymmetric tolerances. The 
motivation for the new index pkC′′  is based on the general criteria stipulated by 
Boyles (1994) and Choi and Owen (1990) when analyzing and comparing the existing 
capability indices dealing with process yield, process centering, and other process 
characteristics. The generalization pkC′′  is defined formally as  
,

where * * *max{ ( ) / ,  ( ) / }u lA d T D d T Dµ µ= − − , uD USL T= − , lD T LSL= − , *d   
min{ , }u lD D= . Observe that *( ) / ud T Dµ − = [ ]min{ , }( ) /( )u lD D T USL Tµ − −  and 
* ( ) / ld T Dµ− = [ ]min{ , }( ) /( )u lD D T T LSLµ− − . Obviously, if T M=  (symmetric 
tolerance), then * u ld d D D= = = , * | |A Mµ= −  and pkC′′  reduces to the original 
index pkC . We note that the index pkC′′  attains the maximal value at Tµ = , 
regardless of whether the preset specification tolerances are symmetric or not. 
For processes with asymmetric tolerances, the corresponding loss function is also 
asymmetric with respect to T . The pkC′′  index is designed to account for the 
 6
K . The rth moment, and the first two moments as well as the mean and the variance 
of ˆ pkC′′  are derived by Pearn and Chen (1998).  
Note that ˆ pkC′′  is a biased estimator of pkC′′ . The resultant bias is negative for all 
the cases in the Pearn and Chen (1998) investigation as long as Tµ ≠ . For Tµ = , 
the bias is positive for 10n =  but becomes negative for larger values of n . For 
* / 2.0d σ =  it is negative for all 20n ≥ ; for * / 3.0d σ =  it is negative for 30n ≥ ; 
for * / 4.0d σ = , it is negative for 40n ≥  and for * / 5.0d σ = , it is negative starting 
with 60n ≥ . As n  becomes very large, the bias becomes 0. Note that when the 
tolerance is symmetric, the results are the same as those provided by Kotz et al. 
(1993).  
2.5. Sampling Distribution of the Estimated ′′pkC  Index 
We shall now denote 1/ 2 *( / )B n d σ=  and Y = * * 2[max{( / ) , ( / ) }]u ld D Z d D Z− . 
Using these notations ˆ pkC′′  can be expressed as  
ˆ [ 1( )] /(3 )pkC n B Y nK′′ = − − .                   (8) 
Let ( )Φ ⋅  and ( )φ ⋅  be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the 
probability density function (PDF) of the standard normal distribution (0,1)N , 
respectively. The CDF and the PDF of the variable Z  distributed as ( ,1)N δ  can be 
expressed as: ( ) ( )ZF z z δ= Φ −  and ( )zφ δ− , respectively. Hence, the CDF of Y  
is given by: 
* *( ) [( / ) ] [ ( / ) ]Y uF y D d y D d yδ δ= Φ − −Φ − −A ,            (9) 
and the PDF is 
( **1( ) [( / ) ]2Y u uf y D D d yd y φ δ= − + )*[( / ) ]D D d yφ δ+A A .     (10) 
Therefore, the CDF of the estimator ˆ pkC′′  can be expressed as follows (see Pearn

We consider the relationship between pkC′′  and pkS , and connect pkC′′  to a 
possible maximum non-conformities. Note that pkC′′  attains the maximal value at 
Tµ = , regardless of whether the preset specification tolerances are symmetric or not. 
Evidently, if Tµ = , then we have * 0A =  and pkC′′ = * /(3 )d σ . Therefore, if Tµ =  
and given pkC c′′ = , then we have * /(3 )d cσ = . Since both pkC′′  and pkS  are 
functions of ( , )µ σ , we may denote them by ( , )pkC µ σ′′  and ( , )pkS µ σ , 
respectively. Since *( , /(3 ))pk pkC S T d c′′ ≤  for all possible values of ( , )µ σ , we 
conclude that given a process with ( , )pkC µ σ′′ = c , the fraction non-conforming would 
be guaranteed to be less than that of a process with ( , )pkS µ σ = *( , /(3 ))pkS T d c . 
Therefore, we have PPM ≤  610 ×2{1–Φ [3 *( , /(3 ))}pkS T d c  and

4.1. Algorithm for Calculating the Lower Confidence Bound 
By using Equation (18), we may compute the lower confidence bound LC . An 
algorithm applying the technique called the binary search method is developed. And 
the accuracy of the calculation on the type I error 1 γ−  is set to 410− . An efficient 
Matlab computer program (available on request) executing the algorithm is also 
developed, which incorporates three auxiliary functions for evaluating LC , including 
(a) the cumulative distribution function of the chi-square 2 1nχ − , ( )KF ⋅ , (b) the 
probability density function of the standard normal distribution (0,1)N , ( )φ ⋅ , and (c) 
the function called “quad”, which numerically evaluate integral using the recursive 
adaptive Simpson quadrature. The Matlab program requires no more than 10 CPU 
seconds for all samples sizes investigated, to compute the lower confidence bound 
values.  
Algorithm for Calculating LC    
Step 1. Input the specification limits (LSL, T, USL), sample data 1 2( , ,..., )nx x x , 
sample size n  and the confidence level γ . 
Step 2. Calculate x , s , ξˆ  and ˆ pkC′′ .  
Step 3. Give an initial guess of the lower confidence bound LC . 
Step 4. Use a numerical integration technique with iterations to evaluate the 
lower confidence bound LC  until achieving the preset accuracy.  
Step 5. Output the conclusive message. 
 
The lower confidence bound not only provides practitioners information on the 
minimal level of the actual performance of the process, but is also useful in making 
decisions for capability testing. To test if the process meets the capability requirement 
set to C , i.e. 0 :H pkC C′′ ≤ , we simply determine the confidence level γ  and run 
the computer program to obtain LC . If the value of LC  is larger than the capability 
requirement C  (i.e., LC C> ), we conclude that the process indeed meets the 
capability requirement with the confidence level γ . 
4.2. Lower Confidence Bound LC  and Parameter ξ  
In practice, since the process mean µ  and standard deviation σ  are unknown, 
then the parameter ξ  is also unknown and may need further estimation. It has been 
naturally done by substituting µ and σ with the sample mean x  and the sample 
standard deviation s . To eliminate the need for further estimating the distribution 
characteristic parameter ξ , we examine the behavior of the lower confidence bound 
values LC  against the parameter ξ . We perform extensive calculations to obtain the 
lower confidence bound values LC  for ξ = − 2.00(0.05)2.00, n =10(5)200, 
ˆ
pkC′′ =0.7(0.1)3.0, which cover a widespread range of applications.

4.3. Computation of the Lower Confidence Bound LC   
We implement the algorithm, and execute the Matlab program to calculate the 
lower confidence bound values of LC  for various combinations of input parameter 
settings. Tables 3-4 tabulate the lower confidence bound values, LC , for n = 
10(5)200, ξ =−2.0(0.5)2.0 and 0.25± , γ =  0.95 and ˆ pkC′′  = 1.00, under /l uD D = 
3/1 and 3/2, respectively. In Tables 5-6, we consider the same settings as in Tables 3-4, 
except for ˆ pkC′′  = 2.00. For example, if the calculated value ˆ pkC′′  = 1.00 for γ =  
0.95, n  = 150, ξ  = 1.5−  and /l uD D = 3/2, the lower confidence bound LC  = 
0.899 (see Table 4). We may conclude that the true value of the process capability 
index pkC′′  is no less than 0.899 with 95% level of confidence. 
Also we may set ξ = 1 in Equation (18) to calculate LC  for the case l uD D> . 
We tabulate the lower confidence bound values, LC , in Tables 7-8, for n = 10(5)200, 
ˆ
pkC′′ =1.0(0.1)2.0, and γ =  0.95, under /l uD D  = 3/1 and 3/2 respectively. For 
example, given γ =  0.95, /l uD D = 3/1 and n  = 80, if the estimated value of ˆ pkC′′  is 
1.5, we may check Table 7 under column ˆ pkC′′  = 1.5 and row n  = 80 to find the 
lower confidence bound LC  = 1.292. We may then conclude that pkC′′  ≥ 1.292, and 
the confidence level is 0.95. 
5. Sample Size Determination 
The sample size determination is essential to most factory applications, 
particularly for those implementing a routine-basis data collection plan for monitoring 
and controlling process quality. It directly relates to the sampling cost of a data

5.2. Computation of the Required Sample Size n  
The sample size determination is important, as it directly relates to the cost of 
data collection plan. To compute the sample size required n , we develop a Matlab 
program (available on request) using a simple linear search method. The accuracy of 
the calculation on the type I error is set to 0.005. The program reads the desired 
estimation precision pkR , the estimated value ˆ pkC′′  and the confidence level γ, and 
outputs the sample size n  required. Tables 9-10 display the sample size n  required 
under /l uD D = 3/1 and 3/2, respectively, for pkR  = 0.70(0.01)0.90, ˆ pkC′′ = 1.00, 1.33, 
1.67, 2.00 and γ = 0.95, 0.975, 0.99.  
For example under /l uD D  = 3/1, if estimation precision pkR  is set to 0.85 and 
ˆ
pkC′′  = 1.33, then with γ = 0.95 the sample size needed is n  = 43 (see Table 9). We 
conclude that a minimum sample size of n  = 43 is required to be 95% certain that 
the true pkC′′  is no less than pkR  = 85% of the sample estimate ˆ pkC′′ . Thus, if the 
sample estimate ˆ pkC′′ = 1.33, then the true value of pkC′′  is no less than 1.33 × 0.85 =

the process is under statistical control. The validity of the normality has been verified 
by using the Shapiro and Wilk (1965) W test. Figure 15 displays the normal 
probability plot of the sample data, and from this figure the sample data appears to be 
normal. Figure 16 displays the histogram of the 100 observations with density line 
and specification limits (LSL, T, USL) = (16.25, 17.00, 17.50).

and ˆ pkC′′ = 1.69. Based on confidence level γ = 0.95, ˆ pkC′′  = 1.69, n = 100, the 95% 
lower confidence bound of pkC′′  can be found by solving Equation (18). We execute 
the Matlab program and obtain the lower confidence bound LC = 1.488 based on 
collected sample. We therefore conclude that the true value of the process capability 
index pkC′′  is no less than 1.488 with 95% level of confidence. And the 
corresponding possible maximum non-conformities are 4.022 PPM. 
If we set the unknown parameter ξ = 1 in finding the lower confidence bound, 
the corresponding execution output is LC = 1.483, and the corresponding possible 
maximum non-conformities is 4.314 PPM. We thus can claim that the “tie rod end” 
forging process is capable of reproducing products yield no less than 99.99957% and 
the fraction of nonconformities is no greater than 4.314 PPM. Furthermore, since 
LC = 1.483 > 1.33 = C, the null hypothesis “ 1.33pkC′′ ≤ ” will be rejected at the 
significant level 0.05α = . We may claim that the process meets the capability 
requirement “ pkC′′ >  1.33” with 95% confidence level, or equivalently, at the 
significant level 0.05α = . These product items conformed to the manufacturing 
specifications and are considered as reliable products.

7. Conclusions 
In recently years, process capability analysis has become an important integrated 
part in the applications of statistical process control to the continuous improvement of 
quality and productivity, and pkC  index is the most commonly used index in 
managerial decisions. Treat the calculated estimate ˆ pkC  as true value and ignore the 
effect on asymmetric tolerances may lead to misinterpretation of process capability. 
Granted that cases with symmetric tolerances are common in practical situations, 
cases with asymmetric tolerances also often occur in the manufacturing industry. To 
address the issue, Pearn and Chen (1998) proposed a generalization called pkC′′ , 
which was shown to be superior to other existing generalizations of pkC  for 
processes with asymmetric tolerances. For symmetric tolerances case, pkC′′  may 
reduce to pkC . Based on the complicated probability density function of the natural 
estimator of pkC′′ , we developed an efficient algorithm to compute the lower 
confidence bounds on pkC′′ , to enhance the applicability of the theoretical results. To 
make the proposed method practical for in-plant applications, we tabulated the values 
of the lower confidence bounds for various commonly used situations. Furthermore, 
the sample size required to achieve a desired confidence limit with specific 
confidence level have been studied and tabulated. For illustrative purpose, a 
real-world example on the forging process, taken from a forging supply company has 
been investigated. This study implements the theoretical results and bridges the gap 
between theoretical results and factory applications.
