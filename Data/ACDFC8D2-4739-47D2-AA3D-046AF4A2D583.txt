ABSTRACT 
Performance evaluation of a signal transmitted 
through a Land Mobile Satellite (LMS) channel 
involves a great degree of difficulty due to the 
system’s complexity. It is particularly impossible 
to evaluate error performance in a direct manner 
using a closed form solution because of the 
time-varying character of the satellite. Although 
modeling and verification of fading effects has 
long been a subject of research in any mobile 
communication environment, there exists little 
information on the time-varying fading model for 
the LMS communication system. To evaluate the 
system performance of the LMS system, 
techniques using computer simulation models 
based on the statistical analysis can provide a 
reasonable degree of accuracy. However, the 
process takes a great deal of time, especially when 
it is required that lower probability of bit error rate 
must be predicted. Instead of the computer 
simulation, this project tries a mathematical 
formulation to calculate the error probability using 
numerical method. In this project, the LMS 
channel is modeled by including most of the 
practical channel elements. Applying Lee’s 
satellite channel modeling, including log-normal 
statistics (with mean and variance) and Ricean 
statistics (with parameter K), focus is on the 
development and analysis of the time-varying 
fading model. Then, derive an analytic form of 
error probability of the LMS communication 
system by applying a high order of moment 
technique, where the discrete probability density 
functions of various degradation factors are 
constructed and used to evaluate probability of 
error. By using this method, the overall system 
performance of the LMS system can be calculated 
in an effective manner. The boundary limitation 
for using moment technique could be found to 
compensate the approximation solution.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In the personal communication networks (PCN) 
service, the performance limitations of mobile 
communication depend on the base-station using 
terrestrial towers. To reduce power of the cellular 
handset, the cell size might vary from a radius of 
1-km in the city to that of 6-km in the country. 
Because the cost of a base-station was too 
expensive but covered less area, the Land Mobile 
Satellite (LMS) communication system using the 
geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite located at 
a circular orbit in the equatorial plane at an 
altitude of 35,786 Km, has been proposed [1]. 
However, a GEO satellite requires high transmitter 
power and a large antenna aperture. 
Communication using GEO satellite is expensive 
and carries a high risk of satellite launch. 
Non-GEO communication systems offer several 
advantages over GEO systems such as: robustness 
to communication failure because there are at least 
two satellites which cover the same footprint, truly 
global coverage, low path loss requiring low 
effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), small 
propagation delay. Importantly, non-GEO also 
offers a low cost communication environment that 
has been proposed for commercial purposes 
recently [2]. 
However, in the LMS communication using 
non-GEO satellite, the system performance is 
affected by many factors. In addition to the 
conventional thermal noise, the fading effects 
degrade the system performance greatly. For 
effective performance analysis, fading effects are 
usually modeled based on statistical assumptions 
[3]-[8]. Some examples are Lognormal, Rayleigh 
and Ricean distribution. Alternatively, the 
Nakagami distribution can also be used to model 
the Rayleigh and Ricean distribution. Many results 
are available for different channels using various 
fading models. Apart from the fading effect, there 
are other factors that affect the system 
performance such as nonlinearity of Traveling 
Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA), Doppler effect, 
intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by the 
transmitter filter also can affect the system 
performance under severe channel bandwidth 
limitation, adjacent channel interference (ACI) 
characterized by unwanted signals from other 
frequency channels into the specific user also 
degrades the system performance and co-channel 
interference (CCI) for multiple user application. 
Additionally, contrary to the LMS communication 
system using GEO satellite, the non-GEO 
satellites continuously move around the earth in 
their orbits. Hence, the channel characteristics are 
time-varying [9]. Most of the prior research in the 
LMS communication system has been 
concentrated on the verification of channel models 
consideration of Ricean and Lognormal statistics 
for non-GEO LMS communications [14]. These 
models could be applicable to geostationary and 
non-GEO satellite communication. In this project, 
three parameter channel model is presented. 
Corresponding the probability distribution of the 
signal envelope from LEO satellite at L band in 
Fig 1, the numerical evaluation to the cumulative 
probability distribution is tabulated in Table I. It 
shows the parameter values of µL,1, bo, and d0 , for 
different ELs, where µL,1 is the mean of lognormal 
distribution , b0 is the average multipath 
component power and d0 is the standard deviation 
of lognormal distribution, respectively. 
 With the Ricean and Lognormal statistics for 
non-GEO LMS communications, it needs to know 
the moment about these two statistics. For Ricean 
statistics, the Nth moment, µR,N could be derived 
to 
 
         (5) 
where Γ(⋅) is Gamma function. [15] For 
Lognormal statistics, 
         (6) 
The moment of lognormal fading factor is 
         (7) 
According to the above moment calculation, 
applying MT, the discrete density function of 
degraded factor could be found. The performance 
evaluation in eq.(3) is shown in Fig. 2. After the 
degree of precision v=4, there is no big difference. 
Hence, the residential error in eq. (4) should be 
investigated to realize the bound of the 
approximation.  
IV. RESIDENTIAL ERROR WITH MT 
In the preceding section, it shows MT based 
approach in the form of a linear combination of 
error probability pe(r). (wn1, UIm, UQn1), (wn2, Vu,,In2, 
Vu,Qn2), (wn3, vn3) and (wn4, Vu,,In4, Vu,Qn4) are 
chosen from the first M moments. For a refined 
approach, one can find the upper and lower bound 
to E[pe(r)]. If (wn2, Vu,,In2, Vu,Qn2), (wn3, vn3) and 
(wn4, Vu,,In4, Vu,Qn4) are a Gaussian Quadrature Rule, 
the residential error function in eq.(4) could be  
   
         (8) 
where kN is the coefficient of rn in the polynomial 
PN(r) to find the Gaussian Quadrature Rule. 
For the summarized results, the optimum bounds 
to E[pe(r)] are in the form

If the function pe(r) has continuous (M+3)th 
derivative, and p(M+3)e(r) is nonnegative, the upper 
bound and lower bound is as shown in eq.(9). 
However, p(M+3)e(r) is nonpositive, it uses - pe(r) 
instead of pe(r). [16] If M is odd, N’=(M+1)/2 and 
N’’=(M+3)/2. If M is even, N’=N’’=(M+2)/2. 
CONCLUSION 
In this project, the moment technique applied to 
evaluate the error performance of the Land Mobile 
Satellite Communication Systems is presented. 
Since there are a lot of degradation factors in the 
system, the closed form solution is hardy found. 
To avoid the complicated calculation, the discrete 
probability density function of degraded factors is 
constructed by MT. Although MT based error 
performance does not provide an exact solution, 
the boundary limitation with applying MT is 
discussed. This work can be used as an important 
reference to design a LMS communication 
systems.
