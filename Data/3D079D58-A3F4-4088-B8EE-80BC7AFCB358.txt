The Intelligent Pricing Decision Support System of 
Integrating Oil Price Fluctuations and Logistics Service (I) 
 
 
Abstract 
Recently, the international crude oil price 
continuously rises and the domestic fuel oil 
price also rising. Especially the government 
implements the “floating fuel price mechanism” 
to cause the fuel oil dynamic fluctuations. For 
the distributors, it is not only increases the oil 
procurement costs, but also the increases the 
costs of vehicle maintenance and associated 
materials since the oil price continuously rising. 
Thus, it increases the operational costs and 
reduces the profits. For the third party distributor, 
it is the key to improve profit by establishing a 
mechanism to adjust freightage according to fuel 
oil fluctuation. Moreover, how to consider the 
whole transportation requirements to utilize the 
optimal distribution model will affect the 
operational costs and resources deployment. The 
first stage of this research is to establish a 
freightage adjustment model according to oil 
dynamic fluctuation to provide the reasonable 
and scientific management decision for 
distributors. Second stage is establish a 
relationship model between logistics system and 
freightage using the simulation analysis to 
provides a freightage decision-making to ensure 
the profit in consideration of routes planning, 
distribution model, and resources deployment.  
 
Keywords: Third-party logistics, floating fuel 
prices, freight fee adjustment model 
1. Introduction 
In recent years, international crude oil price 
fluctuations have affected oil suppliers in 
Taiwan, which has led to a continued rise in the 
oil price. Although the Taiwanese government 
has implemented a floating oil price since 2006, 
this price adjustment mechanism is primarily an 
instantaneous response to the magnitude of the 
international crude oil price rise or fall. This 
means that consumers can follow the market 
mechanism and purchase oil in a more equitable 
way. However, since the international crude oil 
price started to fluctuate, the magnitude of the 
domestic oil price decrease is far behind that of 
the price increase. In the example of freight 
transportation using super diesel, in March 2005 
the price was NT$ 19 per liter, which rose to 
NT$ 33.5 per liter in July 2007, an increase of 
76.3%. For the logistics and transportation 
sectors which rely mainly on diesel for fuel, as 
well as the sustained rise in oil price increasing 
the cost of oil purchases, this also causes a 
corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance 
as well as consumptive material, resulting in a 
substantial increase in operating expenses. For 
the logistics and transportation sectors, a higher 
oil price leads to an increase in operating costs, 
which can drastically reduce profit margins. 
Considering the above discussion of the impact 
of oil price fluctuations on operations in the 
logistics industry, this study proposes a 
mechanism by which the industry can respond to 
oil price fluctuations in an objective and 
 3
Considering the diesel used for freight activities, 
the price of NT$ 27.64 per liter in Taiwan is 
cheaper than that in Japan, Korea, and Singapore 
by 44.6%, 63.3% and 26.8% respectively. This 
indicates that government policy on oil pricing in 
Taiwan is more favorable than that in 
neighboring countries. Since the implementation 
of a floating oil price in September 2006, price 
adjustment has been based primarily on the Platts 
energy report using the average price of Dubai 
crude and Brent crude, respectively weighted at 
70% and 30%. Oil prices were adjusted once a 
week until November 2007, when the 
government considered the impact of rising oil 
prices on businesses and citizens. The “freezing 
oil price” mechanism was thus implemented until 
May 2008, even though the oil prices had still not 
been adjusted. In June 2008 a new government 
assumed office, and in August 2008 resumed the 
weekly price adjustment mechanism.

This study employs 3PL as the main model. 
Since the scope of the freight industry is limited 
to licensed truck drivers, the mode of operation 
business to business (B2B) refers to the general 
freight forwarding industry or operations by 3PL; 
business-to-customer (B2C) refers to online 
shopping or express home delivery services; and 
customer to customer (C2C) refers to online 
auctions or personal home product delivery.  
The operating revenue of the logistics firms 
discussed above comes from freight delivery 
revenue. In accordance with the long-term 
contract signed by the commissioner of the 
goods, a single item’s freight fee rate varies 
according to product attributes that may require 
special delivery conditions, such as delivery 
time (weekday or holiday), delivery area (cities 
or remote district), quantity of deliveries (one 
large piece or multiple small pieces), delivery 
types (shop, home, or project delivery), and 
product attributes (room temperature or frozen). 
Different freight fee rates apply for different 
items. The billing model is based on the number 
of successfully delivered items and the 
pre-determined freight fee rate to calculate the 
monthly freight costs.  Thus, when oil prices 
begin to fluctuate logistics firms cannot react in 
a timely manner and must absorb the increased 
operating costs themselves. Not only does this 
show the impact of implementing a floating oil 
price mechanism on the operations of logistics 
firms, it also highlights that in light of the 
floating oil price mechanism, it is crucial for 
logistics firms to establish a fair and reasonable 
freight fee adjustment mechanism. 
The operating revenue of the logistics firms 
discussed above comes from freight delivery 
revenue. In accordance with the long-term 
contract signed by the commissioner of the goods, 
a single item’s freight fee rate varies according to

M ijk: Number of dispatch for commodities in the 
region i, product attributes j, the quality of

In practice, 3PL firms employ a different 
way of calculating the freight fee rate to general 
freight firms. General freight firms follow one 
single rate stated in the pricing contract, except 
in the case of LTL (less than truckload) shipping. 
On the other hand, 3PL firms differ in terms of 
the following characteristics: (1) tailor-made 
logistics services; (2) nearly full compensation 
for the value of commodities in the case of loss, 
theft, and damage. Another consideration is that 
with freight costs and operating costs, it is 
impossible to use a single freight rate as the 
general rate for calculation, for there would be a 
significant impact on profit and revenue. 
According to the above discussion, the more 
product attributes or services required, then the 
more complicated it is for 3PL firms to calculate 
the freight fee rate. Moreover, the 
implementation of a floating oil price multiplies 
the operating costs and thus erodes profitability 
of 3PL firms. With further consideration of 
long-term commercial interests and a timely 
response to logistics costs, the authors of this 
study believe that freight fee adjustment as a 
response to the floating oil price is acceptable to 
customers. However, the key is how to set an 
“adjustment range” considered reasonable by 
both parties. This is a major decision and is the 
key parameter affecting the profitability of 
logistics firms. Therefore, when constructing the 
presence of dynamic fluctuations in oil prices, 
3PL firms will adjust the freight pricing model 
for the current period in response to oil price 
fluctuations. In practice, it is mutually beneficial 
and reasonably applied research for the agent 
and the principal. 
After gaining a preliminary understanding 
of 3PL firms' pricing models, the next step is to 
derive a freight fee adjustment model in 
response to oil price fluctuations. First of all, it 
is necessary to use relationships between the 
freight fee, quantity for dispatch, and fuel 
consumption as the basis for an aggregate 
analysis. Taking diesel fuel used by the freight 
industry as an example, the freight fee 
adjustment model is as follows:  
 
[ ]titiii PPOMC 1−−×⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛＝                 (2) 
 
Of which: 
Ci: month i of adjustments (increase or decrease) 
of freight fee 
Mi: month i of the total quantity for dispatch 
O: ratio of the dispatch quantity and fuel 
consumption 
= average monthly dispatch quantity ÷ fuel 
consumption in liters in the current year 
t
iP ：average oil price t for month i  
t
iP 1− ：average oil price t for month（i-1) 
 
According to equation (1), after using the 
actual dispatch quantity for the current month to 
consider the dispatch region, service quality, and 
product attributes, the freight charging fee for 
the current month can be obtained. In the case of 
dynamic fluctuations in oil prices, equation (2) 
 7
shows that in 2009 the accumulated parcel to 
fuel consumption for each month is greater than 
that in the previous two years, indicating that the 
fuel efficiency of the distribution operations is 
improving.  
In the freight fee adjustment model, the 
ratio of distribution quantity to fuel consumption 
is the key element affecting the freight fee. To 
understand the sensitivity of the freight fee to 
the parcel to fuel consumption ratio, “fuel 
consumption ratio of the previous year” and 
“fuel consumption ratio of the current year” are 
used to estimate the adjusted value of the freight 
fee.  
 
(1)In November 2007, due to the continuous rise 
in global crude oil prices, the government 
implemented the “freezing oil price” mechanism 
in order to mitigate the impact on citizens and 
enterprises, which left oil prices unadjusted from 
that point until April 2008. In May 2008 after a 
new government took office, the floating oil 
price mechanism was restored. Generally 
speaking, there was a rise in oil prices, 
especially in July 2008 when the oil price rose 
by 12.79% (NT$33.5 per liter) from the previous 
month. In November 2008 the oil price 
decreased by 21.27% (NT$ 18.62 per liter) from 
the previous month.  
 
(2) Considering the performance as measured by 
the efficiency of distribution, in July 2008 the 
quantity for distribution reached 31,355 parcels 
and the fuel consumption was 19.874 liters, 
which yielded a parcel to fuel consumption ratio 
of 1.58. This indicates that the ratio was the 
largest in the past; the worst ratio was 1.14 in 
January 2007. The parcel to fuel consumption 
ratio can reflect the overall distribution 
efficiency in the current month. Thus, a review 
of the fuel consumption ratio of each delivery 
vehicle carries management value in enhancing 
the efficiency of distribution operations and 
management of fuel consumption.  
 
(3) In studying freight fee adjustment in 
response to oil price fluctuations, take December 
2008 and January 2009 as examples. In 
December 2008 oil prices were adjusted four 
times, respectively 12/6 (NT$17.2 per liter), 
12/13 (NT$16.8), 12/20 (NT$17.5), and 12/27 
(NT$17.1), while from 11/31 to 12/5 the oil 
price remained at NT$17.3 since the last week 
of November. Meanwhile, the quantity for 
distribution was 32,459 for that month, 
corresponding to a total fuel consumption ratio 
of 1.43 for that year. Meanwhile the average 
monthly oil price had fallen by 7.89% from the 
previous month, which can be reflected in the 
reduction of freight fee in practice:

If the parcel to fuel consumption ratio in the 
previous year was 1.23, then NT$3,235 would 
be reduced. However, in January 2009 oil prices 
were respectively adjusted three times: 1/3 (NT$ 
17), 1/10 (NT$ 19.5), and 1/17 (NT$ 19.3), 
while the average monthly oil price rose by 
8.45% from the previous month, which in 
practice should be reflected in an increase in 
freight fee:

obvious decrease in the costs of oil purchases

5. Conclusion and recommendations 
In recent years, international crude oil 
prices have continued to rise. Since oil is the 
only energy source for transport vehicles 
belonging to logistics firms, the costs of oil 
purchases and vehicle maintenance have 
climbed higher, thus substantially increasing
