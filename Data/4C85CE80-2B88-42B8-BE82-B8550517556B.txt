Abstract 
The experiments of submerged cultivation of 
Monascus anka were carried out according to the 
sequential pseudo-uniform design (SPUD) method. 
Adopting the inputs including the cultivation temperature 
and the dissolved oxygen and the outputs including the 
measurements of glucoamylase activity and concentration 
of extracellar red pigment, a second-order response model 
was successfully identified using the eleven experiments 
located by the initial uniform design (UD) method 
followed by the SPUD method. The identified model 
achieved a 2.71% averaged modeling error for the 
glucoamylase activity but 12.44% averaged modeling error 
for the concentration of extracellar red pigment. 
Considering the resource for carrying out the experiments, 
the optimized operating conditions were determined based 
on the available experimental data to achieve the maximal 
overall desirability objective function of glucoamylase 
activity and concentration of extracellar red pigment of the 
product. The experimental results shown in this work 
successfully demonstrated the applicability of the SPUD 
method for locating minimal experiments that will 
effectively guide the experimenter toward optimized 
operating conditions of a new process.

Introduction 
Monascus species has been fermented on steamed rice to 
form red koji or “Hongqu” in many East Asia countries for 
more than 600 years (Ma et al., 2000). Red koji contained 
many valued-added constituents such as blood cholesterol 
lowering agent- monacolins, GABA (r-amino-butyric acid) 
and pigments (Cicero et al., 2005; Jung et al., 2003; Li et 
al., 2004; Ma et al., 2000). The pigments produced by 
Monascus sp., particularly the red one, are in importance 
used as natural food colorants for wine, soybean cheese 
and meats (Teng and Feldheim, 2001). Recent efforts to 
obtain high yield of pigment production has attracted 
considerable attention (Carels and Shepherd, 1977; Fenice 
et al., 2000; Hajjaj et al., 2000; Lim et al., 2000; Wu et al., 
2000). High yields of pigments produced by Monascus sp. 
was found associated with high glucoamylase activity 
(Lim et al., 2000;Rasheva et al., 2003). The highly valued 
products of Monascus anka - including hydrolysis 
enzymes (amylase), primary metabolites (unsaturated fatty 
acid, alcohol, and ester), secondary metabolites (pigments 
(red, orange, yellow, etc.)), Monascidin, Monacolins, 
GABA (γ-amino-butyric acid), natural antioxidant 
(flavonoids), substances for lowering blood-sugar, and 
other unidentified physiological activities - have 
traditionally been obtained by solid-state fermentation 
(Kono and Himeno, 2000; Wang and Lin, 2000). This 
cultivation process is generally carried out manually; 
therefore, the quality of the product anka is closely related 
to the performance of the operators. Even though the 
standard operating procedure can be followed, there are 
too many factors affecting the whole process producing the 
product with stable and desired quality. The liquid phase 
submerged cultivation of Monascus anka could be an 
alternative approach to obtaining the desired product under 
controlled conditions (Wang and Lin, 2000; Lin and Huang, 
1983; Yongsmith et al., 2000; Lee et al., 1995; Hajjaj  et 
al., 1999; Huang, 2000). 
In a real application, optimization of a new process 
such as the liquid phase submerged cultivation of 
Monascus anka typically hinges on obtaining a reliable 
process model with a minimal expenditure of time or 
resources. This objective may be achievable through a 
reliable process model formulated classically on the basis 
of mass and energy balance for chemical processes 
(Ponnuswamy and Shah, 1987; Chang and Liao, 1998). 
However, such a modeling approach may not be suitable 
for bioprocesses. Biological processes are not 
deterministic systems. In general, unstructed or structed 
deterministic models dealing with microbial pathways and 
microbial physiology are exceedingly complex. In addition, 
as it is almost impossible to measure intracellular 
concentrations on-line, these models generally have too 
many uncertain parameters difficult to estimate. It is 
significant to generate models based on the appropriately 
measured variables, as these can be used in process 
optimization of biological systems. The regression models 
or neural networks, which offer a data-driven modeling 
approach, are well suited for the above-mentioned 
purposes, having good generation and prediction 
capabilities (Karim et al., 1997; Karim et al., 2003). In 
general, much more experimental data are required for 
identifying a neural network model than a regression 
model. To successfully identify a reliable process model, 
the gathered experimental data have to be distributed 
across all of the regions of the input space that are of 
interest. Therefore, the uniform design (UD) method (Fang 
and Ma, 2000) and the developed sequential 
pseudo-uniform design (SPUD) method (Chang and Lin, 
2004) could meet such a requirement and will be 
implemented to locate limited but sufficient experiments

concentration of extracellar red pigment was again 
estimated from the absorbance of the extract at 500 nm, 
considering the dilution factor. Details of measuring the 
glucoamylase activity and the concentration of extracellar 
red pigment could be found in the thesis by Lee (2004).  
 During the cultivation of Monascus anka, the 
potential factors that could affect the outcomes of the 
cultivation are the temperature, the dissolved oxygen (DO), 
the pH value of the submerged culture, etc. In this research, 
only the temperature (27~42 C° ) and the DO (10~40%) 
of the submerged culture were chosen as the control 
factors. Six levels were first chosen for each control factor, 
and the designed experiments )6( 26U based on the UD 
method are shown in Figure 1. The designed isothermal 
temperature trajectory was achieved by circulating the 
isothermal water through the jacket of the reactor vessel 
while the desired dissolved oxygen in the culture was 
performed by adjusting the speed of the agitator and the 
aeration rate. Actually, the target for constant dissolved 
oxygen can be achieved with the existing hardware in the 
experimental system after the initial period of cultivation 
(0~ f7
3 t ) was experienced as shown in Figure 2. 
However, this control factor was assumed to accomplish 
the target level in identifying the regression model. The 
total time of cultivation was 120 hours ( ft ). The 
measurements of glucoamylase and the pigment were 
taken every 24 hours as shown in Tables 1 and 2. If the 
information provided by a small number of batches (six 
experiments) is sufficient for building a regression model, 
one may admit that the UD method is a suitable 
experimental design method because a set of 
representative experiments scattered uniformly and 
regularly in the region to be investigated is adequately 
provided. Let Θ  (U/ml) be the glucoamylase activity, 
Ψ  (OD500) the concentration of extracellar red pigment, 
T (0C) the cultured temperature, and Ω  (%) the 
dissolved oxygen (DO). The experimental data were used 
to obtain the second-order response model using the 
package of Design-Expert (State Ease, version 6.0.7): 
The mapping between the output Θ  and the inputs T 
and Ω  is: 
Θ  = – 290.03663 + 16.57181T  + 
14.12702Ω  – 0.21806 2T –0.24035 2Ω  (2） 
While the mapping between the output  Ψ  and the 
inputs T and Ω  is: 
Ψ  = – 280.80989 + 15.20660T  + 
4.19575Ω  – 0.22120 2T –0.089907 2Ω  （3） 
 The analysis of variance （ANOVA）analyses was 
done on the measurements taken from the )6( 26U  
experiments. Tables 3 and 4 indicate the analyses using 
the package Design-Expert. The F-value of the identified 
model for the glucoamylase activity 28.33 implies that the 
identified model characterizing the glucoamylase activity 
is not significant. Similar result could be found for the 
identified model describing the concentration of extracellar 
red pigment. The )6( 26U  experiments were used to 
construct the second-order response model with 15.68% 
averaged modeling error (the absolute value of the residual 
between the measurement and the model output divided by 
the measurement) for the glucoamylase activity and 
93.93% averaged modeling error for the concentration of 
extracellar red pigment as shown in Figure 3. The results 
shown in Figure 3 confirm again that the identified 
second-order response model is not satisfactory, because 
significant averaged modeling errors exist. 
 
2.2 Submerged Cultivation of Monascus anka based on 
the SPUD Method 
 Because the ANOVA of the identified second-order 
response models is not significant using the experimental 
data located by the initial UD method, additional 
experiments should be provided to generate new data for 
verifying the identified model or constructing a new model. 
Therefore, the following five interpolated experiments 
were located using the SPUD method and are shown in 
Figure 4 (a). The experiments (exp. no. 7~11) to be 
carried out are shown in Table 1 or Table 2. The 
experiment (exp. no. 7 given in Table 1) with the desired 
control factors T  (34.50C) and Ω  (25%) was firstly 
carried out and the outputs of the experiment were Θ  
(215.75 U/ml) and Ψ  (16.86). By constrast, the model 
outputs (Eqs. (3) and (4)) were Θ  (225.11U/ml) and 
Ψ  (29.23). The errors for Θ  and  Ψ  were 4.16% 
and 42.32%, respectively. Therefore, the identified 
second-order response model was not reliable, employing 
only six experimental data located by the UD method. In 
fact the new experiments located by the SPUD method 
should be carried out completely to give us additional 
information to construct the reliable models. Therefore, the 
rest of the experiments located by the SPUD method were 
conducted. The measurements of glucoamylase activity 
and extracellar red pigment for the experiments are shown 
in Tables 1 and 2. 
 Using the experimental data (exp. no. 1~11), the 
identified second-order response models were: 
Θ = – 819.61588 + 55.53825 T  – 0.81046 Ω  – 
0.75478 2T – 0.0028624 2Ω + 0.044620 ΩT            
         (4) 
Ψ = – 109.65717 + 8.67169 T  – 0.83776 Ω  – 
0.14429 2T –0.00146508 2Ω  + 0.026068 ΩT     
         (5) 
Tables 5 and 6 show the relevant analyses on the 
experimental data (exp. no. 1~11) using the package 
Design-Expert. The F-value of the identified model for the 
glucoamylase activity 32.8 implies that the identified 
model describing the glucoamylase activity is significant. 
A similar result could be found for the model describing
