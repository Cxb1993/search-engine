1.1 Membranes 
Membrane is generally defined that a selective barrier is as an 
interface between two phases. To obtain more useful understandings, 
membranes can be classified by different viewpoints. According to 
materials, membranes can be divided into natural and synthetic ones. 
Based on affinity, membranes can be divided into hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic ones. In terms of charged nature, membranes also can be 
separated into neutral, positive and negative charged ones. Additionally, 
 11 
(NF), reverse osmosis (RO), pervaporation (PV), gas separation (GS) and 
membrane distillation (MD) and so on [5-6]. Every separation process 
must correlate with suitable separated species. The characteristics of 
separated species, such as molecular size (as shown in Figure 1-2 [2]), 
affinity, vapor pressure, density, charge and chemical property etc., are as 
the bases for the selection of separation processes when separating the 
feed species. 
Membrane separation processes are based on that membranes act the 
selective barrier layers between feed and permeate sides to separate the 
species through those by different driving forces, as shown in Figure 1-3 
[5]. The driving forces mainly include pressure difference (ΔP), 
concentration difference (ΔC), temperature difference (ΔT) and electrical 
potential difference (ΔE). Different separation processes couple with 
different driving forces to separate suitable species. An overview of 
various membrane processes and driving forces is shown in Table 1-3 [5].

Membrane distillation Liquid Liquid ΔT/ΔP 
 
To membrane research, systematic studies can be traced to the 
eighteenth century philosopher-scientists. Although membranes have no 
industrial or commercial uses through the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, those are used laboratory tools to develop physical/chemical 
theories. Up to 1960, the fundamentals of modern membrane science 
have been developed and only used in some laboratory and small, 
specialized industrial applications. A breakthrough for industrial 
membrane applications is carried out by the asymmetric reverse osmosis 
cellulose acetate membranes developed by Loab and Sourirajan [7] in the 
early 1960. These asymmetric membranes composed of a very thin dense 
toplayer connected with a porous supporting layer have higher flux than 
symmetric membranes. Afterward membrane technology during the 
period from 1960 to 1980 generates a significant change. Based on the 
Loeb-Sourirajan technique, other membrane preparation processes, such 
as interfacial polymerization and multilayer composite casting and 
coating etc., are developed to obtain high-performance membranes. GFT 
(now Sulzer Chemtech) in Germany developed the polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA)/polyacrylnitrile (PAN) composite membranes for dehydration of 
alcohol in 1980. The commercial pervaporation systems are established. 
 
1.2 Pervaporation 
Pervaporation is an attractive separation process for the mixtures, 
such as the close boiling-point mixtures, heat-sensitive mixtures, 
azeotropic and isomeric mixtures etc., the removal of water from organic 
liquids and the removal of organic contaminants from waste water. 
Pervaporation is first developed by Kober in 1917 [8]. He prepares the

In addition, the schematic drawing of the pervaporation process with a 
downstream vacuum or an inert carrier-gas was shown in Figure 1-5.

Most of aqueous alcohol solutions are azeotropic mixtures, such as 
aqueous ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol (IPA) and tetrafluoropropanol (TFP) 
mixtures etc. Their azeotropic components and points are shown in Table 
1-4. Aqueous EtOH solutions can be produced by the fermentation of 
disposed biomass resources such as the lees of sugar corn and the stem of 
corn. Aqueous EtOH solutions are actively being investigated as new 
energy sources which would avoid problems associated with limited 
petroleum resources [11]. IPA, a clean energy source, is one of the 
important solvents used in a large scale in industries, particularly in

[18-19], grafting [20-21], addition [22-24] and plasma [17, 25], (3) 
synthesis of new membrane materials [26-29]. It is found that polyamides 
and polyimides prepared by suitable molecular design, membrane 
preparation and modification methods have superior pervaporation 
performance than conventional materials. The pervaporation performance 
of polyimide membrane for organic mixture solution and Ethanol-water 
solution are shown in Tables 1-5 and 1-6

with both high permeability and selectivity are desirable. Higher 
permeability decreases the amount of membrane area required to treat a 
given amount of gas, thereby decreasing the capital cost of membrane 
units. Higher selectivity results in a higher purity gas product. A rather 
general tradeoff relationship has been recognized between permeability 
and selectivity: polymers that are more permeable are generally less 
selective. Numerous studies on the relationship between the molecular 
structure of polymers and gas transport properties have been reported in 
an attempt to gain a better understanding of the transport mechanism. The 
inducement is to improve the transport properties by surmounting the 
tradeoff behavior between polymer permeability and selectivity, i.e., to 
simultaneously increase the gas permeability and selectivity.  
    An important element contributing to gas separation technology 
success is the development of new membrane materials with high 
permeability and selectivity. Another important factor is to make a highly 
permeable and selective membrane with good mechanical and thermal 
stability. There have been active studies on the development of 
high-performance polymers for gas separation. In particular, glassy 
polymers (polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, etc) have been widely 
applied to the separation of gas mixtures such as oxygen/nitrogen. 
According to solution-diffusion model, the pervaporation obeys solution 
and diffusion processes through a membrane, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Figure 1-7 The simplified polycondensation of polyimide 
 
solution and solid-state polycondensation. Low-temperature 
polycondensation suits for the reactions by using the monomers with poor 
stability, high melt point or thermal sensibility. Because of low reaction 
temperature, the monomers must have high purity or high reactive to 
carry out the reaction. The resulting polymers own superior thermal 
stability and resistance to organic solvents. Low-temperature 
polycondensation mainly includes interfacial and solution 
polycondensation [30]. 
In the past, polyamide, polyimides and polyamide-imide are 
processed difficultly because of their poor solubility and high soften 
temperature. Thus, such polymer membranes are only prepared using 
melting or dissolving by concentrated sulfuric acid. Polyamide, 
polyimides and polyamide-imide have a choke point to apply to 
membrane separation processes. For example, the polyamide membrane 
 25 
However, the composite membrane is characterized by a top separation 
layer formed onto a chemically different asymmetrical porous substrate. 
The benefits of these independent polymeric layers can be combined to 
obtain the desired membrane performance. The development of 
composite membranes is a key factor for successful polyamide, 
polyimides and polyamide-imide membrane application in many areas. A 
good example of composite membranes is the PVA/PAN composite 
membranes, PERVAP® 2201 and PERVAP® 2510, which are produced by 
Sulzer Chemtech. 
 
1.5 Objective 
Polyamide, polyimides and polyamide-imide have been studied as 
one suitable membrane material. However, one of the disadvantages of 
the pervaporation and ges separation process through dense polyamide 
membranes is the low permeation rate. In order to improve low gas 
permeability and permeation rate of polyimide and polyamide membranes, 
aromatic polyimide and polyamide membranes were synthesized by 
direct polycondensation of various diamines containing flexible ether 
groups and bulkier substituents with various aromatic dianhydrides and 
diacids, respectively. The effects of various chemical structures on gas 
separation and pervaporation performances were investigated. Then, the 
effect of surface modification on the solution-diffusion behavior of 
polyimide and polyamide membranes was also investigated.

polymer was then washed with hot acetone using a Soxhlet extractor for 3 
hours collected on a filter and dried at 100 oC under vacuum. The 
inherent viscosities of poly(amide-imide)s were in the range of 0.93 to 
1.43 dL/g. The poly(amide-imide)s reaction pairs are shown in Table 2-1. 
 
2.2 Membrane preparation 
The dense poly(amide-imide)s membranes were prepared by casting a 
N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solution containing about 8 wt% 
polymer on glass plates. Membranes were then dried in an oven at 70 oC 
for 1 hour. After drying, the membranes were removed from the glass 
 29 
The density of the membrane was measured by buoyancy technique. A 
well-dried membrane sample was first weight in air and then the volume 
of the membrane was measured with a pycnometer (Accupyc-1330). 
From the weight in air and the volume, the density of the polymer 
membrane was calculated. The density was used to calculate the fraction 
free volume (FFV) from the following equation: 
V
VVFFV 0-=         (1) 
where V is the specific volume and V0 is the occupied volume of the 
polymer. The occupied volume was calculated from the van der Walls 
volume, VW, by the Bondi’s group contribution method. 
V0=1.3 VW           (2) 
A related measure of chain packing, the polymer chain-packing density of 
each polymer (PD), was calculated using the following relation: 
OVV
VPD
-
=         (3) 
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were taken for each 
polymer membrane at a aCuK  wavelength l  of 1.54 Å  on a 
PANalytical X-ray Diffractometer, X’Pert PRO MPD. The corresponding 
d-spacing values which provide a measure of intersegmental distance 
between polymer backbones were calculated from the diffraction peak 
maximum through the Bragg equation, ql sin2/=d , where l  is the 
wavelength of the radiation and q2  is the angle of maximum intensity in 
the amorphous halo exhibited by these polymers. 
 
2.4 Gas permeation and sorption measurements 
Gas permeation analyzer (Yanaco GTR 10) was used to measure the 
mixed gas permeability coefficients, P, for the polymer membranes, as 
shown in Figure 2-2. The tests were carried out under isothermal

performance was measured in terms of two quantities: (1) separation 
factor aA/B and (2) permeation rate (g/m2h) , defined as 
Separation factor(aA/B) = (YA/YB)/(XA/XB) 
Permeation rate(g/m2h) = W/(A×t) 
where XA, XB and YA, YB are the weight fractions of A and B in the 
feed and in the permeate (A is the more permeative species), respectively, 
and W, A and t represent the weight of permeate(g), the effective 
membrane area(m2) and the operation time(h), respectively. 
 
2-6 Sorption measurement 
The membranes were immersed in ethanol-water mixtures for 24h at 
room temperature. They were subsequently blotted between tissue paper 
to remove excess solvent and placed in the left tube of a twin tube set-up, 
as shown in Figure 2-5. The system was evacuated while the left tube was 
heated with hot water and the right tube was cooled in liquid nitrogen. 
The composition of the condensed liquid in the right tube was determined 
by G.C..

2-7 Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS)  
PAS is a special nondestructive evaluation technique for material 
characterization which uses the positron. Positron, antiparticle of electron 
(anti-electron), can be obtained from the radioisotope decay. For example, 
Sodium-22 (22Na) is most widely used because of the benefits of long half 
life (2.6 years) coupled with reasonable price. When 22Na nucleus decays, 
a proton in that transforms into a neutron. 22Ne and β+ particle (positron) 
are formed, coupling with the emission of a 1.28 MeV gamma ray (γ-ray). 
In addition, when a positron meets an electron, two phenomena occur. 
One is the positron-electron annihilation. The other is the formation of 
positronium (Ps). Positronium and hydrogen atom are very similar. The 
difference between them is that positronium owns a positron but 
hydrogen has a proton. Positronium is unstable and decays to generate

the positron or positronium annihilations occur in the space of materials 
and simultaneously emit the 0.511 MeV γ-rays (stop signals). The 
lifetime of the positron from generation to annihilation is dependent on 
the size of the space in materials. The space in materials is larger, 
coupling with the electron density in that is lower. The opportunity to 
occur the positron annihilation is smaller, resulting in increasing the 
annihilation time of positrons. Therefore, PALS can be used to explore 
the sizes and distributions of free volume in the polymer membranes. The 
positron annihilation lifetime spectrum is shown in Figure 2-6. From the 
analyzed result of PAL spectrum, positron lifetimes (τ1, τ2 and τ3) and 
intensities (I1, I2 and I3) result from the positron and positronium 
annihilation in polymeric membrane materials. The shortest t1 of 0.125 ns 
is from p-Ps annihilation, t2 of ~ 0.45 ns is from the positron annihilation, 
and t3 results from the o-Ps annihilation. Ps is known to preferentially 
localize in defect sites, especially in the free volume, before the 
annihilation occurs. So, the parameters from the o-Ps annihilation can be 
used to obtain the electron properties and depth profiles of free volumes 
in thin film polymers. The lifetime t3 from pick-off annihilation of o-Ps 
and electrons is on the order of 1-5 ns in polymeric materials and is used 
to calculate the mean free-volume radius.

Results and Discussion 
3.1 Polymer characterization 
The presence of the bulky pendent groups in the polymers is 
expected to greatly affect the packing density and chain rigidity and 
subsequently affect the gas-transport properties of the polymers. An 
analysis of the polymer structure effect on the gas permeability requires 
knowledge of the polymer physical properties. The polymer physical 
properties results for the three polymers are listed in Table 3-1. The

That was revealed that all poly(amide-imide)s had excellent flexibility 
after preparing membranes. As shown in Table 3-1, the FFV value order

3.2 Pressure effect on the gas transport properties of 
poly(amide-imide) membranes 
Figures 3-2 and 3-3 present the pressure dependence of 
permeabilities of the poly(amide-imide)s to O2 and N2 at 35 oC, 
respectively. The permeability values are either approximately 
independent of the upstream pressure or decrease slightly with increasing 
the pressure between the interval of 2 to 10 atm. These results are 
consistent with the results from other studies. Based on the data presented 
in Figures 3-2 and 3-3, the O2 and N2 permeabilities are in the following 
order: 6F-TBAPS＞6F-DBAPB＞6F-BAPB. Referring to the Table 3-1 
again, the FFV of membrane is highest for 6F-TBAPS, trailed by 
6F-DBAPB and finally 6F-BAPB, which shows a similar membrane 
 43 
permselectivity of the 6F-TBAPS membranes is slightly higher than that 
of the 6F-DBAPB and 6F-BAPB membranes. These results exhibit that 
both permeability and permselectivity are enhanced by incorporation of 
the bulky pendent groups in the poly(amide-imide)s backbone.

that the low-temperature transition for the polyamides was around -50 oC, 
attributed to a motion mechanism (rotation) of the amide bonds, and that 
for the polyimides was near -110 oC. Therefore, the γ-transition peak near 
-50 oC, γ1-transition, was contributed from the amide moiety of the 
poly(amide-imide) and the one near -110 oC, γ2-transition, was 
contributed from the imide moiety of the poly(amide-imide). This result 
was similar to the γ-transition behavior of the polysulfone, which 
proposed that the γ1-peak (higher temperature) was related to the motion 
of the methyl-substituted phenylene and the γ2-peak (lower temperature) 
to the motion of the unsubstituted phenylene. 
As shown in Figure 3-5, the γ2 and γ1 transition temperatures of the 
poly(amide-imide) membranes are in the same order of 6F-TBAPS (-127 
/ -59 oC) < 6F-DBAPB (-125 / -56 oC) < 6F-BAPB (-118 / -54 oC). The 
6F-TBAPS containing the symmetrical tetramethyl substituents on the 
phenyl rings of the TBAPS moiety has the lowest γ-transition temperature 
among all poly(amide-imide)s. Figures 3-6, 3-7 and 3-8 show the 
correlation among the fractional free volume, the γ-transition temperature 
and the O2 permeability for the poly(amide-imide) membranes. With 
increasing FFV, the O2 permeability increases but the γ-transition 
temperature decreases. This involves the intermolecular chain packing 
and free volume. The poly(amide-imide) with high free volume, such as 
6F-TBAPS, has low γ-transition temperature. This indicates that as the 
bulky groups are introduced, such as the symmetrical tetramethyl 
substituents on the phenyl rings, polymer chain packing is inhibited and 
FFV increases, then, relaxation takes place at a lower temperature. Thus, 
gas molecules penetrate easier into the intermolecular chain spaces and 
consequently improve the gas permeability. Hence, 6F-TBAPS has the 
highest FFV, O2 permeability and the lowest γ-transition temperature.

three parameters fitted using a nonlinear least-squares regression of the

mode of the dense polymer. Oftentimes the Henry’s law constant can be 
correlated with the condensability of the penetrant. The Langmuir 
capacity constant, C’H, measures the sorption capacity of the unrelaxed 
free volume. The Langmuir affinity constant, b, is a measure of the 
penetrant’s ability to sorb into the free volume Langmuir sites. As shown 
in Figures 3-9 and 3-10, it is obvious that pure gas sorption in the

from the ratio of P to S. Poly(amide-imide) bearing the bulky linkage 
TBAPS is more permeable than their analogs to all penetrants tested. It is 
due to the introduction of bulky substituents, such as the 
hexafluoroisopropylidene linkage in the diimide-dicarboxylic acid moiety 
and the symmetrical tetramethyl substituents on the phenyl rings of the 
diamine moiety, causing the polymer chain packing is hindered and FFV 
increases. It can be seen that for 6F-TBAPS, the higher PO2 is attributed to 
the larger DO2 and a larger SO2 than those of their analogs. The PO2/PN2 is 
dominated by the DO2/DN2. The larger DO2 and SO2 might be closely 
related to the FFV and d-spacing in the membrane. As can be seen from 
Table 3-3, the gas solubility was observed to be a much weaker function 
of FFV than diffusivity. The gas solubility increased slightly with 
increasing free volume. Consequently, the above results clearly indicate 
that the diffusivity of the membrane is almost mainly responsible for the 
transport of gas molecules, the solubility only little affects gas permeation 
properties.

Results and Discussion 
4.1 Polyimide preparation  
Polyimides were prepared by the direct polycondensation 
polymerization of the 2,2-Bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]norbornane 
(BAPN) and 4,4’-Hexafluoroisopropylidenebisphathalic anhydride 
(6FDA). The route is illustrated in Figure 4-1.

4.2 Effect of feed ethanol concentration on the permeation

pervaporation for the BAPN-6FDA polyimide membranes are shown in

membranes 
 
4.3 Effect of the feed solution temperature on the 
pervaporation performances 
The effect of feed solution temperature on the permeation rates and 
PSI value for pervaporation of 90wt% aqueous ethanol solutions through 
the BAPN-6FDA polyimide membranes are shown in Fig. 4-3. It shows 
that the permeation rate increases and the PSI value increases as the feed 
solution temperature increases. From these phenomena it may be assumed 
that the increases of swelling of the membrane matrix at higher 
temperature results in increased polymer segmental motions. Additionally, 
the partial pressure of ethanol in the vapor phase increases with 
increasing the feed solution temperature, resulting in the membrane 
further swelling. This facilitates the transport of ethanol molecules along 
with water, thus the ethanol concentration in the membrane increases with 
increasing the feed ethanol concentration, as shown in Fig. 4-4.  
 59 
4.4 Solution-diffusion transport mechanism 
In order to investigate the effects of solubility and diffusivity on the 
membrane permselectivity, sorption experiments for the BAPN-6FDA 
polyimide membranes were made. According to the solution-diffusion 
model, the permeability(P) of a permeant through a membrane is a 
product of the solubility(S) and the diffusivity(D). The effects of the 
ethanol concentration in the feed on the sorption selectivity and the 
diffusion selectivity are discussed in the following section. The sorption 
experiments were performed to determine the separation factor of 
sorption, αS , for the BAPN-6FDA membranes. Thus, the diffusion 
selectivity, αD , can be calculated from the following equation: 
 
αD  = α/αS 
 
The effect of the ethanol concentration in the feed on the separation 
factor(α), sorption selectivity(αS ), and the diffusion selectivity(αD ) 
are shown in Fig. 4-5. It shows that the sorption selectivity increases with 
an increasing the ethanol concentration in the feed, which can be 
accounted for by the high affinity between the ethanol and the 
BAPN-6FDA polyimide membrane. The separation factor, shown in Fig. 
4-5, first decreases but then increases with an increasing the ethanol 
concentration in the feed. The diffusion selectivity decreases with 
decreasing the fed ethanol concentration.  
 61 
rate and the PSI value of BAPN-6FDA polyimide membranes increases 
with increasing the feed ethanol concentration In addition, the permeation 
rate increases and the PSI value increases as the feed solution temperature 
increases. The sorption selectivity increases with an increasing the 
ethanol concentration in the feed, which can be accounted for by the high 
affinity between the ethanol and the BAPN-6FDA polyimide membrane. 
The diffusion selectivity dominates the behavior of pervaporation 
 63 
larger than that of the BDAPD-6FDA polyimide membrane.

5.2 Polyamide membrane free volume analysis 
The effect of diamine structure on the free volume of the polyamide 
membranes were studied in this section. Polyamides were prepared by the 
direct polycondensation polymerization of the 
2,2-Bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]norbornane (BAPN) 、 BAPPC：
1,1-Bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]-4-phenylcyclohexane (BAPPC) 、
α,α’-bis[3,5-dimethyl-4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]-1,4-diisopropylbenzen
e (BDAPD) and 4,4’-hexafluoroisopropylidenedibenzoic acid (6FDA). 
The route is illustrated in Figure 5-3. To understand the relationship 
between the free volume size distribution and polyimide structure, the 
positron lifetime distributions and the τ3 results were analyzed with the 
use of positron annihilation spectroscopy; the analysis is shown in Figure 
5-4. We employed the results of o-Ps annihilation lifetime (τ3) to analyze 
the volume of free-volume hole. Table 5-2 shows the effect of the 
polyimide structure on the o-Ps annihilation lifetime. It shows that the the 
o-Ps annihilation lifetime and the relative intensity (I3) value order was, 
BAPN-6FDA-PA＞ BAPPC-6FDA-PA＞ BDAPD-6FDA-PA , agreed 
with the the size of diame pendent group. The BAPN-6FDA-PA 
polyimide with a big pendent group results the polymer chain packing 
density decreased. Thus, the o-Ps annihilation lifetime of the 
BAPN-6FDA-PA polyimide is larger than that of the BAPPC-6FDA-PA 
and BDAPD-6FDA-PA polyimide membranes.
