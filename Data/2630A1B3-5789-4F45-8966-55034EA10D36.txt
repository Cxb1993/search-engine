Figure 2. The typical two-dimensional C(k, n：F) system.
Recently, the two-dimensional C(k, n：F) system has received extensive research interest due to the
main fact that it can be applied into various areas, e.g., safety monitoring systems, design of electronic de-
vices, disease diagnosis, and pattern recognition etc (Salvia and Lasher [4], Hsieh and Chen [5]). Note that
little research has been done on the reliability of two-dimensional C(k, n：F) system. As Salvia and
Lasher [4] mentioned that it is very difficult to derive “simple” explicit formulas for the reliability of two-
dimensional C(k, n：F) system. Therefore, the most research efforts on the development of reliability up-
per/lower bounds for the two-dimensional C(k, n：F) system.
In this paper, we will propose a more general class of two-dimensional consecutive-component sys-
tems, in which the typical two-dimensional C(k, n：F) systems are special cases of the proposed systems.
Additionally, we will investigate the optimal maintenance policy for the two-dimensional consecutive-
component systems whose objective function denotes long run expected average cost per period. A new
immune algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Numerical results of various combinations of parame-
ters are reported.
2. The New Proposed Two-Dimensional Consecutive-Component Systems
For convenience, we consider the following general two-dimensional consecutive-component system in
Figure 3 as an example. This system contains 20 components, and there are 10 minimal cuts for the system,
namely, C1={1,2,5,6,9,10}, C2={5,6,9,10,13,14}, C3={9,10,13,14,17,18}, C4={2,3,6,7}, C5={6,7,10,11},
C6={10,11,14,15}, C7={14,15,18,19}, C8={3,4,7,8,11,12}, C9={7,8,11,12,15,16}, and C10={11,12,15,16,
19,20}. Note that for this example the central components are more important than those of aside in the
system.

Chung, there are more than two possible maintenance policies in this study, and (2) our proposed two-
dimensional consecutive-component systems generalizes the typical C(k, n：F) system studied by Flynn
and Chung.
Assumptions.
1. There are two possible states for the system, i.e., failed and working.
2. Component i has mi maintenance policies, {0,1,…,mi-1}, where 0 denotes no maintenance, ni1 .
3. The reliabilities of components are known.
4. All components in the system are independent.
5. Any failure of minimal cut of components will incur the system failure.
6. The total cost is the long run expected average cost per period.

Since the typical maintenance problem of C(k, n：F) system is a NP hard problem (Flynn and Chung
([9]、[10]), clearly this proposed maintenance problem of consecutive-component system is also a NP
hard problem.
Definition of Optimal Maintenance Policy. (Flynn et al. [11]、Flynn and Chung [9])
Denote byΩthe set of all subsets of {1,2, …, n} and x represents the set of all n-tuples of zeros and ones.
Results in Chung and Flynn ([9]、[10]) ensure the existence of an optimal critical component policy (CCP).
A CCP is a stationary policy where the decisions are determined by a critical component set SΩand re-
placing component j if and only if j is failed and jS. For SΩ, letδS denote the critical component policy
with S as its critical component set, and let dS = (dS1, dS2,…,dSn), where dSi{1, 2,…, mi-1} if iS and
dSi=0 if iS. Note that dS is feasible when the beginning-of-period set of functioning components is a
subset of S. In general,δS(x) =(max{dS1, x1}, max{dS2, x2},…, max{dSn, xn}), xX. Call SΩan optimal
critical component set if δS is optimal. For SΩ, let PF(S) denote the failure probability of system under
dS, and let：

Suppose that SΩdominates TΩ, then {G(S)<G(T) or G(S)=G(T)} and B(S) B(T). As known,
Branch-and-Bound Method can be used to solve the proposed maintenance problems. However, it is both
time and memory consuming especial when the problem size is larger. More specifically, the Branch-and-
Bound Method is very inefficient for C(k, n:F) system when n＞40 and 2＜k＜n-15 (Flynn and Chung
[10]). Heuristics can be also developed to solve the proposed maintenance problems. However, no optimal
solution is guaranteed and it is usually converged to local optimal solutions even when the problem size is
small (Flynn and Chung [9]). Additionally, Implicit Enumeration Method and Genetic Algorithm can be

(a) For implicit enumeration method, the CPU time is exponentially increasing with the increase of n.
However, it is not so drastic for the immune based algorithm. For n=5 and k=2, it requires much time
for the immune algorithm due to the increase of minimal cuts (see Table 1).
(b) The proposed immune algorithm can obtain the optimal solutions which are the same as those by im-
plicit enumeration method (see Table 1).
(c) The proposed immune algorithm can obtain multiple optimal solutions for test problems. For example,
Table 1 shows the top-3 optimal solutions by the immune algorithm and they are the same as those of
implicit enumeration method. Table 2 and Table 3 also show this characteristic.
(d) The proposed approach is very efficient for our test problems. For example, Table 2 shows that it re-
quires only 30.153 CPU seconds to obtain the top-5 solutions for the two-dimensional consecutive-
component systems in Figure 3.
(e) Table 3 shows that the optimal solutions trend to use lower levels of maintenance components with the
increase of k. For example, when k=5 the optimal solution contains more zeros than that of k=2.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, (1) we have proposed a more general class of two-dimensional consecutive-component sys-
tems which generalize both consecutive-k-out-of-n:F system and typical two-dimensional consecutive- k-
out-of-n:F system, (2) we have investigated the optimal maintenance policy for the consecutive-component
systems whose objective function includes long run expected average cost per period. A new immune
based algorithm is proposed to solve the problems. Numerical results have shown that the proposed im-
mune algorithm performs well for all test problems.

一、參加會議經過
2007年技術創新、風險管理暨供應鏈管理國際研研討會 (International Symposium of
2007 Technology Innovation, Risk Management and Supply Chain Management)由中國
北京理工大學主辦，於2007年11月1日至11月3日在中國北京之友誼賓館(Beijing
Friendship Hotel)舉行，共有各國超過一百五十多篇論文發表。11月1日報到並領取
會議議程等相關資料，11月1日由大會主席開幕後由美國Georgia Tech名譽教授 Prof.
Alan Porter以「Tech Mining to Drive Open Innovation」為題做開幕演講，Porter教授
亦為Technology Analysis & Strategic Management for Information and Decision
Technologies學會之主編與主席。研討會議共分成六個場次同時進行。筆者論文「A
Two-Phase Approach for the Optimal Location of surveillance cameras」安排在11月2
日發表。此次會議為國際創新、風險管理暨供應鏈管理研究領域之中型之國際會
議，各國之主要學者雲集，並有大師級之演講，獲益良多。
二、與會心得
研討會每天有多個分項議程(Sessions)同時研討，與會者可以參加任一個 Session。
Session間隔時間約 2小時，每個 Session約有 6~7篇文章發表，各 Session的主持人
由分項議程的發表人擇一論文發表者出任。Session主持人通常會分配每一篇文章的
研討時間，研討的方式是由文章的作者發表著作並進行問答，發表及問答通常會交
錯進行，參加的人員可以自由向作者提問，或逕行互相討論。文章的討論都非常踴
躍，這是因為與會的主席與參予者都有充分的準備，此處頗值得國內學術會議效法。
除了主要的分項研討外，大會會中的點心咖啡時間採開放式的形式，與會學者們可
以利用此段時間允分連絡感情與交換意見。本人也藉由餐會認識許多中國、香港、
馬來西亞等各國的學者，大多數學者都有極高的意願到台灣來參訪。除此之外，此
次會議，除可更進一步了解各學者從事之研究，亦可與各學者腦力激盪，創造更多
未來自己研究的議題。
