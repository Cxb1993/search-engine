三 報告內容 
1. 前言與研究目的 
In this project, we propose a new real time image transmission method with secure and error resilient 
capabilities, an extension of our previous works. In this approach, an image sharing via sharing of the JPEG 
2000-generated bit stream of multiwavelet transform coefficients through the modified Shamir’s (r, m) 
threshold scheme over Galois field. Instead of using the bit-plane scanning over individual sectors of an 
image, we firstly apply the multiwavelet transform (either integer or real) to an input image, process the 
transformed coefficients by using the JPEG2000 algorithm to generate an embedded binary bit stream, and 
then divide the stream for every ti bits into m ti-bits shares (channels) over Galois Field. With these 
embedded shares, it yields excellent rate-distortion and secure shadows for error-resilient and real-time 
progressive image transmission. The JPEG2000, a new image coding standard based on wavelet transform, 
has a set of desired features that enable robust image transmission over noisy channels. In JPEG2000, each 
subband is partition into relatively small block, called code-blocks. Each code-block is coded independently 
to produce embedded bit-stream. The coded data of each code-block is distributed across one or more layers 
in the stream. Each layer successively and monotonically improves the image quality so that the decoder can 
decode the information in each layer in sequence. In this project, an integer or real multiwavelet transform 
instead of wavelet transform will be utilized in the JPEG2000 context. Multiwavelets provide multiple basis 
functions for representation that have simultaneous properties of orthogonality, symmetry/antisymmetry, 
and short support. The multiple scaling functions and multiple wavelets provide higher energy compaction 
in smooth (scaling) subband and smaller values of detail (wavelet) coefficients than using single scaling 
function and single wavelet. 
 
2. 研究方法 
The proposed method is divided into two phases: encoding and decoding stages. In the encoding stage, the 
input image X is first processed by the multiwavelet decomposition down to a selected scale level to form a 
multi-resolution hierarchical representation. Then, the JPEG2000 algorithm is used to process the transform 
coefficients to obtain an embedded bit stream. Finally, the binary bitstream is shared by the sharing function 
of the modified (r, m) threshold scheme and processed to hide the error control codes by associate with 
vertical and horizontal parity bits for locating errors to generated m embedded shadows with error resilient 
capability which will be transmitted in m parallel channels. In the decoding side, the inverse procedures of 
the JPEG 2000 encoding phase are followed: first, revealing the embedded bit stream with error detection 
and correction processes, then, applying JPEG2000 decoding algorithm, and finally, taking the inverse 
multiwavelet transform to obtain a reconstructed image Xˆ. Refer to the published paper for details. 
 
3. 結果與討論 
Four images (Lena, Jet, Monkey and Peppers), each has 512×512 pixels with 8 bits per pixel, were used in 
the experiment. The JPEG2000 standard with integer multiwavelet transform, 2-level decomposition, 
64×64code-blocks and the modified (r, m) threshold scheme with r=4 and m=6 were used. An irreducible 
polynomial x7 + x3 +1 was chosen as the prime polynomial in GF(27). Let us consider an ordinary 
communication system for binary PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) baseband signals with a controllable 
additive white Gaussian noise or mis-alignment steps (bits). The transmission characteristic of this 
communication system with bit error rate (BER) versus signal noise ratio (SNR, Eb/N0, dB) is shown in Fig.

In the project, a new distributed image storage and transmission system has been developed. It 
bases on the image sharing via sharing of the JPEG2000-generated bit stream of multiwavelet 
transform coefficients through the modified Shamir’s (r, m) threshold scheme over Galois field. 
Taking advantage of no error propagation feature of JPEG2000, the obtained shadows are 
embedded synchronization marks and error control codes to achieve error-resilience for 
transmission over noisy channels. The method gives embedded shadow images for real-time 
transmission and reconstruction. An elaborate secure analysis has been  done based on 
information theory and the error-resilient capability of the proposed scheme has also been
evaluated. This system is very suitable for multipoint-to-point network communication to 
transmit real-time images over noisy channels. Comprehensive experiments have been
performed to verify the characteristics of the system. Out of the project, one journal paper (in 
Journal of Optical Engineering, Vol.48(12), 127001, 2009) and one conference paper (one in 
Proceedings of ICIP 2009) have been published. 
 
 
參加會議經過與會心得: 
 
The 2009 International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) has been 
held on November 7 - November 10, 2009 in Cairo, Egypt. The 
conference, sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society, is the 
premier forum for the presentation of technological advances and 
research results in the fields of theoretical, experimental, and applied 
image and video processing. ICIP 2009 brought together leading 
engineers and scientists in image and video processing from around the 
world. Research frontiers in fields ranging from traditional image 
processing applications to evolving multimedia and video technologies 
are regularly advanced by results first reported in ICIP technical sessions. 
I attend the conference and present my paper. 
 
There were many interesting presentations in theories, methodologies, 
and applications in science and technology related to image processing. 
These programs provided new research results and trends about those 
fields for possible future researches. 
 
 
 
consecutive stego blocks simultaneously instead of four-
check-bits into one stego block [5] and emphasizing more 
on the secret bits authentication. In addition, Hamming code 
ideas [7] are employed in the check bits so that our proposed 
authentication scheme has error correction capability (i.e., it 
is more robust in the ordinary communication environment 
with noise [8]). Details are described as follows. 
 
2.1. Sharing and embedding secret image 
 
In our method, the integer wavelet transform is applied to 
decompose a secret image into smooth (scaling) coefficients 
at the coarsest scale level and detailed (wavelet) coefficients 
in subbands at successive scale levels, arranged in the 
hierarchical multiresolution representation. An integer 
wavelet transform is used for an exact (lossless) 
reconstruction. The pre-process is applied to convert the 
wavelet transform coefficients into positive integer numbers 
of range from 0 to 255. Then the produced numbers are 
divided into several sections. After that, the Shamir’s (r, m) 
threshold scheme is applied to every section. This will 
generate m shared pixels ܵ௞
௜௝, ݇ ൌ 1,2, … , ݉ and then they are 
embedded into the m cover blocks ܤ௞
௜௝, ݇ ൌ 1,2, … , ݉ , 
respectively where each block ܤ௞
௜௝ ൌ ൛ܺ௞
௜௝, ௞ܹ
௜௝, ܷ௞
௜௝, ௞ܸ
௜௝ൟ 
denotes the block with position (i, j) in the k-th cover image 
as shown in Fig.1(a). The shared pixel ܵ௞
௜௝ , represented 
binarily by (ݏ଼ݏ଻ݏ଺ݏହݏସݏଷݏଶݏଵ), is embedded by replacing 
ݒଷݒଶݑଷݑଶݓଷݓଶݔଷݔଶ with ݏ଼ݏ଻ݏ଺ݏହݏସݏଷݏଶݏଵ to form stego 
block ܤ෠௞
௜௝ as shown in Fig.1 (b). The secret bits embedding 
procedure will be performed to every cover block till a 
whole cover image is processed. For security, a secret key D 
(an integer value) is utilized to generate a random bit-stream 
as watermark bits ሺݓ௡, ݓ௡ିଵ, ڮ , ݓଶ, ݓଵሻ. The secret key D 
can be embedded into a0 of a polynomial function and 
divided into m sub-keys to m participants. 
 
2.2. Embedding check bits 
 
We embed every two consecutive blocks ൫ܤ෠௞௜௝,  ܤ෠௞

check bits ሺ݌଼݌଻݌଺݌ହ݌ସ݌ଷ݌ଶ݌ଵሻ simultaneously as shown in 
Fig. 2 to prevent the dishonest participants from cheating 
and to preclude noisy environment from contaminating in 
stego image. To achieve these goals, three procedures are 
developed to generate check bits as follows.  
Firstly, the first check bit ( ݌ଵ ) generating processes 
which will be used to authenticate the cover block bits and 
secret bits. The procedure is as follows.

for l=1, and similarly for l=2, ڮ ,8 as in Fig 2. 
2. Evaluate ten moduli that are pairwise relatively prime ܯ௞௟

3. Compute the product of ܯ௞௟

4. Compute the multiplicative inverse ܫ௞௟

5. Compute the integer ௞ܻ

 ௞ܻ
௜௝ ൌ ሺ∑ ܴ௡  ൈ ܯ/ܯ௡ଵ଴௡ୀଵ ൈ ܫ௡ሻ mod ܯ         (1) 
6. Compute ݌ଵusing exclusive-or function with the binary 
representation of ௞ܻ
௜௝ ൌ ቀݕ݁ݕ݁െ1  ڮ ݕ2ݕ1ቁ and the watermark 
bits, using Eq. (2) 
    ݌ଵ ൌ ܱܴܺሺܶ, ܳሻ                 (2)  
where ܶ equals  ܱܴܺሺݕ௘, ݕ௘ିଵ, ڮ , ݕଶ, ݕଵሻ and Q equals 
ܱܴܺሺݓ௡, ݓ௡ିଵ, ڮ , ݓଶ, ݓଵሻ. 
Secondly, the secret check bits ( ݌ଷ, ݌ଶ ) generating 
processes which are used to authenticate the secret bits. The 
procedure is similar to the procedure described above. 
Compute (݌ଷ, ݌ଶ) similar to Eq. (2) by using Eq. (3) 
  ሺ݌ଷ݌ଶሻ ൌ ܱܴܺሺܶ, ܳሻ       (3) 
where T equals ܱܴܺሺሺݕ௘ݕ௘ିଵሻ, ڮ , ሺݕସݕଷሻ, ሺݕଶݕଵሻሻ  and Q 
equals ܱܴܺሺሺݓ௡ݓ௡ିଵሻ, ڮ , ሺݓଶݓଵሻሻ. 
Lastly, error correction check bits ሺ݌଼݌଻݌଺݌ହ݌ସሻ 
generating processes which are used to authenticate secret 
bits and to correct errors. The procedure is described below. 
1. Let the sixteen secret bits (i.e. (ݏ଼ݏ଻ݏ଺ݏହݏସݏଷݏଶݏଵ) and 
(ݏ′଼ݏ′଻ݏ′଺ݏ′ହݏ′ସݏ′ଷݏ′ଶݏ′ଵ) in Fig. 2) and five verification bits 
ቀ݌′଼݌′଻݌′଺݌′ହ݌′ସቁ are arranged in the verification pattern as 
shown in Table 1.  
2. Use the idea of Hamming code and exclusive-or function 
to define the verification bits ቀ݌′଼݌′଻݌′଺݌′ହ݌′ସቁ as follows.  
݌Ԣସ ൌ ܱܴܺሺݏଵ, ݏଶ, ݏସ, ݏହ, ݏ଻, ݏԢଵ, ݏԢଷ, ݏԢସ, ݏԢ଺, ݏԢ଼ሻ 
݌Ԣହ ൌ ܱܴܺሺݏଵ, ݏଷ, ݏସ, ݏ଺, ݏ଻, ݏԢଶ, ݏԢଷ, ݏԢହ, ݏԢ଺ሻ 
݌Ԣ଺ ൌ ܱܴܺሺݏଶ, ݏଷ, ݏସ, ݏ଼, ݏԢଵ, ݏԢଶ, ݏԢଷ, ݏԢ଻, ݏԢ଼ሻ 
݌Ԣ଻ ൌ ܱܴܺሺݏହ, ݏ଺, ݏ଻, ݏ଼, ݏԢଵ, ݏԢଶ, ݏԢଷሻ 
݌Ԣ଼ ൌ ܱܴܺሺݏԢସ, ݏԢହ, ݏԢ଺, ݏԢ଻, ݏԢ଼ሻ 
3. For security the verification bits are exclusive-or with 
watermark bits to get the five check bits using Eq. (4) 
  ሺ݌଼݌଻݌଺݌ହ݌ସሻ ൌ ܱܴܺሺܶ, ܳሻ       (4) 
where T equals ቀ݌ᇱ଼݌ᇱ଻݌ᇱ଺݌

    These three procedures are applied to every two stego 
blocks rastly from top left to bottom right till the whole 
stego image is processed.  
 
2.3. Authentication and recovery  
 
The secret image can be recovered by using any r out of m 
stego images. Before the revealing processes, the 
genuineness of each gathered stego image needs to be 
verified and check the possible noisy contamination caused 
by transmission channels to make sure a correct 
reconstruction. The secret key D is revealed from the sub-
keys in r stego images by the Lagrange’s interpolation. 
Watermark bits are produced by the secret key D. Those 
                                                                                                           
                 (a)                                            (b) 
Fig. 4 (a) Characteristics of an ordinary communication system, (b) 
The reconstructed secret image quality using the proposed method 
and Chang et al.’s method at different bit error rate. 
 
These results show that the proposed method has better 
visual quality.  
Fig. 3 (a) shows the obviously modified stego image for 
authentication capability test which consists of an image of 
pepper added into the upper-left corner of the Lena image. 
Note that the added pepper image satisfied parity check 
policy [3]. The authentication result of the stego image 
using the proposed method is shown in Fig. 3 (b). For 
comparison, the authentication results of the stego image 
using Chang et al.’s method is shown in Fig. 3 (c). It is clear 
that the proposed method has better authentication 
capability with better visual detection of the added pepper 
image than those of Chang et al.’s method. The detection 
ratio DR for the proposed method is 99.66%. For 
comparison purpose, the detection ratios DRs for Chang et 
al.’s method, Yang et al.’s method, and Lin and Tsai’s 
method are 96.84%, 51.86%, and 0, respectively. It is clear 
that the proposed method has the best authentication 
performance among all methods.  
      An ordinary communication system for binary PAM 
(Pulse Amplitude Modulation) baseband signals with a 
controllable additive white Gaussian noise [8] was used in 
the experiment. The characteristic of this communication 
system with bit error rate (BER) versus signal noise ratio 
(SNR, Eb/N0, dB) is shown in Fig. 4(a), where Eb is energy 
per bit and N0 is noise spectral density. Such a controlled 
noise was added in every channel and those stego images 
were transmitted over the channels bit by bit. The number of 
error bits was measured at every controlled noise level to 
obtain BERs for test images during the stego images 
transmission. The received stego bits are used to reconstruct 
the secret images and computed PSNR corresponding to 
each BER for the secret image. The test was performed ten 
times for both the proposed method and the Chang et al.’s 
method and the averages were taken as the final results. The 
error correction results of the proposed method are 
illustrated in Fig. 4(b). For comparison purpose, the results 
using Chang et al.’s method are also shown in Fig. 4(b). 
Note that the 70dB means an errorless reconstruction in the 
figure. The results verify the capability of error correction 
over noisy channels of our proposed method. It is clear that 
the proposed method has better error correction capability 
than that of Chang et al.’s scheme and the proposed method 
corrects all errors when the BER is smaller than 10-2. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this paper, a new method of sharing secrets in stego 
images with authentication has been presented. The 
algorithm uses two stego blocks with hiding wavelet-based 
secret image shares combining authentication concepts with 
Hamming codes ideas to effectively tackle the 
insufficiencies of the Chang et al.’s method. Experimental 
results have shown that the proposed approach has enhanced 
the authentication ability, improved visual quality of the 
stego images, and added an additional capability of error 
correction over noisy channels.
