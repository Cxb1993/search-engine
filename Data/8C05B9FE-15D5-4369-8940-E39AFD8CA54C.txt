II. PROPERTIES OF TAPPED λ/4 UIRS AND SIRS 
The SIR shown in Fig.1 will have two resonant 
frequencies due to the open stub. The length and the 
impedance ratios of the low impedance to the high 
impedance sections of the SIR are 2 and 0.3, respectively, 
so that the spurious resonance can be pushed more than 
three times the fundamental frequency [5]. The IE3D 
software [9] is used to do the simulation. In Fig.1, the 
structure is fed with microstrips through small gaps at 
both ends, and both conductor and dielectric are assumed 
loss free to have peak frequencies with a good accuracy. 
Note that when the impedance ratio is unity, the resonator 
becomes a UIR. Both the SIR and UIR without stub are 
designed to have a resonant frequency at fo = 2.45 GHz.  
Fig.2 plots the |S21| response of the circuit in Fig.1. A 
transmission zero fz and two transmission poles fo and fp 
can be observed. Before the circuit design, it is important 
to investigate the dependence of these three frequencies 
on the dimension of the stub. Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b) plot 
the variations of fz, fo and fp against the stub length for the 
UIR and SIR circuits, respectively. The stub length is 
normalized with respect to the corresponding quarter-
wave resonator at 2.45 GHz. Fig.3 indicates some 
important properties of fz, fo and fp as follows. The 
fundamental frequency fo is fixed at 2.45 GHz and it is 
independent of the stub length. The transmission zero fz 
can be located either on lower or upper side of the 
passband, and fp always locates between fo than fz. It is 
interesting to note that when ls/(λ/4) = 1.10 and 1.045 for 
the UIR and SIR cases, respectively; the three curves 
intersect at 2.45GHz, the design frequency. 
III. THE FILTER DESIGN 
The design method for the investigated filter is as 
follows. For a bandpass filter with sharp transitions at 
passband edges, two transmission zeros are required. The 
intuitive way is to cascade two two-pole filters in Fig.1. In 
the design, first locate fz on both sides of the passband, 
tune the resonator size if necessary, and then adjust the 
couplings in the structure. Since the transmission zeros 
have been determined by the stub length, their frequencies 
are unchanged during the cascading of the two stages. 
This can greatly save time in synthesizing the filter 
response. 
IV. UIR FILTER RESPONSES 
Consider a two-stage UIR filter with coupling structure 
A in Fig.4. According to our experience, the contribution 
from fp to the coupling coefficients in the filter is 
negligible. Thus, the synthesis of the passband response 
can be approximated by three coefficients K01, K12 and K23 
determined by fo of the main resonators. For a Butterworth 
response with a fractional bandwidth ∆ = 10%, K01 = K23 
= 0.30 and K12 = 0.11. If a coupling angle of 60o is used, 
the gap sizes can be found to be 0.25 mm and 1.2 mm, for
