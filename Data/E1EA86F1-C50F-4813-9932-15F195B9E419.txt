Experiment 
 
    The CuxSy powders used as 
conductive fillers were manufactured by 
electroless Cu plating and were blended 
by Brabender mixer with EVA pellets 
(UE-659) to form polymeric composites 
those owned the EMI shielding 
effectiveness. The table 1 showed the 
composition and operating conditions of 
electroless Cu bath. 
1. Conductive Fillers Production 
In this investigation, the conductive 
fillers were blended by Brabender mixer 
with polymer matrix to form polymeric 
composites those owned the EMI 
shielding effectiveness. In early study , the 
electroless plating was used to plate the 
Cu31S16 and Cu2-xS on the surface and 
inner of the PAN (polyacrylontrile) film. 
Besides the metal layer had plating on 
specimens, there were some powders 
depositing in the bath during electroless 
plating. Because the rate of reduction 
reaction was too fast, cupric ions directly 
were reduced to form the particles of 
copper sulfide. These particles could be 
affirmed that electric conductivity by way 
of measurement method. 
Then, these powders were used as 
conductive fillers in this investigation. 
Generally, pure copper powders were 
easily formed copper oxide, which was 
electric insulation, with oxygen in air 
during high temperature mixing process. 
In previous study, the transport of 
electrons was decreased as the metal oxide 
increased. Therefore, using copper sulfide 
as fillers had the advantage of 
anti-oxidization. The table 3-1 showed the 
composition and operating conditions of 
electroless Cu bath. In addition, it needed 
no sensitization and activation processes 
before electroless plating and less     
cupric concentration. 
First, we used electroless Cu plating 
to produce these conductivity powders by 
chemical reduction method. First, the 
beaker which contained 1000ml D.I. 
Water was put on the heating apparatus 
and digital DC stirrer. When the 
temperature and stirring speed reached 
setting value, 0.6M cupric sulfate, 0.3M 
sodium bisulfate and 0.3M Sodium 
Thiosulfate were added separately into the 
beaker and maintained the temperature 
and stirring speed for one hour. Then, the 
powders depositing in bath were filtrating 
and gathering to dry in Heat Oven at 50℃ 
for 24h. After drying, the powders were 
pulverized and drying again in vacuum 
oven in order to evaporate residual 
hydrosphere. 
2. Compounding  
The polymeric matrix used was 
EVA(Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate)-659. 
Because of lower melt temperature and 
the better mechanical properties(Table 1). 
The EVA pellets were dried in an oven at 
45℃ for 3h. After drying, 35g of EVA 
pellets, various qualities of conductive 
fillers and process additives were 
pre-mixed before compounding 
(Brabender Plasti-Corder PLE-330). The 
blending temperature was set at 90℃. In 
the feeding stage of filler, the rotation 
speed was 15rpm (Revolution per Minute, 
rpm). Then the rotation speed was 
increased up to 30rpm for 10 min. 
3. Compression Molding 
The composites obtained from the 
compounding processes were sent into the 
frame, delivered into a pair of plates and 
were molded to prepare a variety of 
specimens for testing. The 
hot-compression-molded processes were 
kept at 100℃ and were subjected to three 
step pressure ： 0, 1000, and 2000 
psi-applied for 6, 3, and 2 min. When 
ultimate step was finished, the specimens 
were cooled down with flowing water 
until the temperature fell below 40℃. 
distance between aggregative fillers 
decreased with the increasing of glycerol 
content. by SEM (Figure 4). It was 
assumed that the fillers are folded in 
glycerol and attract by each other due to 
glycerol has strong cohesion. Hence, the 
conductive paths could be formed in 
matrix due to electric tunneling effect as 
the distance between aggregative fillers 
decreased even if fillers volume contents 
does not reach percolation value. 
Nevertheless, it would cause the 
composites too wet to apply in practice if 
the glycerol contents reached certain high 
amount. 
 
4. The Phenomenon of Absorption 
Resonances 
    When the fillers contents ran up to 
100 phr and glycerol contents ran up to 15 
phf, the resonance phenomenon was 
observed in EMI SE curve (Figure 5). And 
the thickness of sample and fillers content 
affected directly this phenomenon in 
Figure 6. The reason is assumed that the 
probability of the electromagnetic wave, 
which is reflected by one filler 
agglomerate, impacts on another filler 
agglomerate will increase with the 
increasing of sample thickness.  
 
5. The Mechanical Properties of 
composites 
In Figure 7, CuxSy/EVA composites 
which had no additives possessed highest 
tensile strength and elongation of all 
blends. It shows that the mechanical 
properties of CuxSy/EVA composites 
decreased with increasing the content of 
glycerol. When glycerol was added into 
blends, it caused agglomerative 
phenomenon resulted from the conductive 
fillers were more difficult to disperse 
uniformly in matrix. Therefore, the tensile 
strength and elongation of those 
composites had deteriorated condition due 
to interface effect as glycerol was added 
into matrix. 
 
6. Influence of Glycerol Content as 
High Fillers Content 
In particular, it only needed 15 phf 
content of glycerol to cause that EMI 
shielding of composites achieved 
maximum at 100 phr content of fillers 
(Figure 5). There was no obvious variation 
in EMI shielding of composites at 15~125 
phf content of glycerol and it just required 
less content of glycerol to reach the 
purpose that a three-dimensional network 
of conductive filler particles is formed in 
matrix as conductive fillers content is 
larger. Figure 8 shows the SEM of various 
glycerol content of CuxSy/EVA 
composites(100 phr fillers content). In 
Figure 8 (i3) can be observed that the 
aggregative fillers was formed in the 
matrix obviously. The average diameter 
and distance of aggregative fillers in 
composites with various glycerol contents.  
Figure 9 shows the FESEM of the 
cross-section of fractured composites with 
various glycerol content as filler retaining 
in 100 phf. The conductive particles were 
not connected each other or arose 
agglomerative phenomenon in matrix as 0 
phf glycerol was added (Figure 9 (a, b)). 
After adding glycerol, it began to become 
the contrary situation. The conductive 
particles began arising agglomerative 
phenomenon or connect each other little 
by little. Consequently, the procedure for 
adding glycerol can cause that the 
situation for a network of conductive filler 
particles (CuxSy) is formed in matrix 
(EVA). Then the glycerol content which 
can reach maximum value of EMI 
shielding of composites had an inverse 
proportion to conductive fillers contents. 
Moreover, the wet problem for an excess 
of glycerol can be solved by adding fillers 
content of composites.
