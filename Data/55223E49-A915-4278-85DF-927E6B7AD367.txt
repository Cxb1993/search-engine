The rest of this project is structured as follow. Section II outlines the related works. 
The proposed medical image representation is presented in Section III. The proposed 
pattern similarity scheme for medical image retrieval is presented in Section IV. The 
experimental results of the proposed scheme are apposed in Section V. Finally, 
Section VI summarizes the conclusions.  
II. Related works 
For the early versions of image retrieval systems, images in the database are usually 
indexed by their semantic keywords. Although such an approach can be used in small 
image databases, both efficiency and effectiveness are decreased for large image 
databases because a limited number of keywords are insufficient to describe the 
content of different types of images. Besides, different users may use different 
keywords to interpret the same visual content of an image. Therefore, the performance 
of this approach to image retrieval is very sensitive to the keywords employed by the 
user and the system. 
In recent years, there is a growing need for retrieving images based on image’s 
visual contents. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) approach can discriminate 
images and retrieve desired images from the database based on their visual contents 
such as shapes [2, 21, 26], colors [11, 30], textures [10, 19], or spatial relationships 
among objects [5, 6, 15, 16, 17, 22, 24, 35, 42]. In such systems, more objective 
low-level image descriptions can be automatically extracted by machines and 
subsequently used as indexing tools or discriminating features for image retrieval. 
In medical images, the contour of abnormal object contains much important 
information for making diagnosis of disease [9]. The shape of tumor is the important 
feature for judging it as malignant or benign, and the size of tumor is the key indicator 
of tumor spread. Spatial relationship is another important feature for medical image 
retrieval. Because the location of lesion or tumor is uncertain, we can retrieve the

picture becomes possible. 
Chang [4] proposed a structure called 9DLT to encode the spatial relationship 
between objects in terms of nine directions. Let us consider a symbolic image 
containing four components (or symbols) A, B, C and D as shown in Fig. 1. We may 
use nine directional codes as shown in Fig. 2 to represent the pair-wise spatial 
relationships between y, a referenced component, and x, a contrasted component. So 
we have a 9DLT matrix T for the symbolic image of Fig. 1 as shown in the Fig. 3.

III. Image representation 
To represent a picture using our method, the picture has to be preprocessed first. 
Assume that the objects in a picture can be identified by some image segmentation 
and object recognition procedures. Various techniques of image segmentation and 
object recognition can be found in [43]. 
In general, there is a dominant object in a medical image, which is the important 
part for diagnosis. In this project, a new image representation is developed for 
diagnosis on liver tumor, so the tumor is the dominant object here. To reduce the time 
complexity and achieve a good effectiveness, the image representation is focused on 
the tumor, and based on the features of factors in diagnosis. The features include the 
gray level, size and shape of the tumor and the spatial relationship between canonical 
organs and the tumor. These features included in the image representation are defined 
 8
shape will be closer to 0; when the shape of tumor is more irregular shown as 
figure 6(b), the value of shape is more closer to 1. So we can diagnose the degree 
of malignance of tumor by the value of shape. 
 
Figure 6: the curve diagrams of two different shapes of tumors. (a) quasi-circular 
shape of a tumor, (b) the irregular shape of a tumor. 
z The location of tumor: 
We define the location of tumor β as the relative angle of the tumor among 
itself, liver and spine, and it is computed by following steps: 
Step1. Compute the centroid of tumor, liver and spine respectively. 
Step2. Draw a line called 0 ° -line from the centroid of liver to the spine’s. 
Step3. Draw a line from the centroid of liver to the tumor’s. Then compute the 
angle β between this line and the 0 ° -line in counterclockwise direction, 
where β∈[0, 359]. 
So the image representation for any image P is defined as: RP = {(Pgl, Psize, Pshape, 
Pβ)} 
For example, Figure 7 is a liver MRI and its segmented form. We can get the image 
representation of Figure 7 by above method. Pgl=90.82, Psize=0.0316, Pshape=0.123, Pβ
=296.187. So the image representation of Figure 7 can be calculated: RP = {(90.82, 
0.0316, 0.123, 296.187)}.

respectively.  
z Dgl, Dsize, Dshape and Dβ: the gray level-difference measure, size-difference 
measure, shape-difference measure and location-difference measure between 
query picture and database picture respectively. 
z wgl, wsize, wshape and wβ: the weights of gray level, size, shape and location 
respectively, where wgl+ wsize + wshape + wβ = 1. 
Now, we can describe the similarity measures defined in this paper as follows. 
z Dgl = (Qgl-Rgl)/255                                             (2) 
z Dsize = Qsize-Rsize                                               (3) 
z Dshape = Qshape-Rshape                                            (4) 
z Dβ = (Qβ-Rβ)/359                                             (5) 
To compare the similarity between query picture and database picture, the difference 
score difference is defined as: 
z difference = wgl×Dgl + wsize×Dsize + wshape ×Dshape + wβ×Dβ 
where wgl+ wsize + wshape + wβ = 1, and difference∈[0, 1].               (6) 
The weights are used to meet user’s requirement flexibly. For example, when the 
user’s query is only focused on the shape of tumor, wshape is set to 1, and other weights 
are all 0. 
Now we use the pictures shown in Fig. 8 to illustrate the effectiveness of our 
similarity measures. Based on the above similarity measuring equations and the 
rationale, we can calculate the values of difference for database pictures p2, p3, p4, p5 
and p6 with respect to the query picture p1. The results obtained are shown in Table 1. 
 12
Dsize for picture p2 with respect to p1 is minimal. Besides, the value of Dsize for picture 
p4 with respect to p1 is maximal, it implies that picture p4 is most different to picture 
p1 among these pictures. In addition, when the user’s query is only focused on the 
shape of tumor, the above result implies that picture p5 is most similar to picture p1 
among these pictures, since the value of Dshape for picture p5 with respect to p1 is 
minimal, the reason is the tumors in other pictures are all almost circle not as in 
picture p1. Finally, we can see when the user’s query is only focused on the location of 
tumor, the pictures p5 and p4 are more similar to picture p1 than others and picture p6 is 
most different from picture p1. The values of Dβ in Table 1 are consistent with above 
result. In conclusion, the results obtained from our similarity measures defined in this 
section are consistent with the human visual system, and we can present the physician 
with a selection of similar cases with known diagnoses by our system. 
V. Conclusion 
In this project, a new image information system is developed for diagnosis on liver 
tumor. In the system, the emphasis is on the development of an efficient and practical 
database for recognizing and retrieving patterns in medical images that represent 
pathological processes. Different from the general-purpose ones, medical image 
retrieval systems utilize the retrieval with pathology bearing regions (PBR) that is 
highly localized. To retrieve similar images efficiently, we develop a medical image 
representation which can capture the color, shape and size of tumor and the spatial 
relationship between canonical organs and abnormal objects. Besides, the image 
representation has the properties of image scaling-, translation- and 
rotation-invariance, and these properties are necessary for an image database system 
with good accuracy. To satisfy physician’s different requirements, the flexible 
similarity measures and the retrieval method based on our image representation are 
also proposed. Examples are used to show that the results obtained from the proposed
