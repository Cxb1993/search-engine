ABSTRACT
The purpose of this research is to apply six sigma management to reduce the impurity of 
substrate glass. The glass substrate is an important material of Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal 
Display (TFT-LCD) panels. Impurity is one of most crucial problems in the manufacturing 
processes of substrate glass. The statistical tools including Fishbone diagram and Failure Mode 
and Effects Analysis (FMEA) are used for quality improvement. The result reveals that the 
impurity loss was reduced from 15 % to 5 %. In conclusion, the DMAIC approach is found 
efficient approach in improving the performance of TFT-LCD Substrate glass process.

3. EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY 
3.1 PROJECT ORGANIZATION 
After the discussion in the top management, a six sigma committee team including general 
manager, vice president, financial manager, human resource manager, production manager, 
quality assurance (QA) manager was established. The QA manager was in charge of 
assisting the top management and serve as the executive chairman. The supervisory 
committee was responsible for the decision, supervising and rewarding of the project. The 
team members of six sigma project were selected from the departments of research and 
developing, manufacturing and quality assurance. In selecting members, the position and 
technological background of the candidates should be considered. Six black belts and 
twelve green belts were chosen as a team. They were responsible for planning and 
execution. The black belts were in charge of teaching and coaching and the green belts 
executed the improvement task. The major task of DMAIC for this project is stated as 
shown in Table 1.

3.2 DEFINE STAGE 
The Major tools in this stage are Team Chart, voice of customer (VOC) and critical to 
quality (CTQ). The first step iss Team Chart. It was used for determination of project 
objectives, project duration, project scope and limitations, project leader and members of 
the team, roles and responsibilities for the members in the project team. With the existing 
equipment and technology, the total defective rate of large-size glass substrates was 25% 
averagely. The defective rate of impurity shared 15% averagely. The initial goal was to 
reduce impurity from 15% to 5 %. The milestone was to carry out the mission within 4 
months.

is stated as follows: Acceptable ≥ 0.9; Marginal 0.8 to 0.9 and Unacceptable < 0.8. All the 
performance of the 3 inspectors are larger than 0.9, it is means that all of these inspectors 
are competent.

Calibration shall be conducted by the National Measurement Laboratory (NML) and should 
be conformant to the nation standard. 
3.4 ANALYZE STAGE 
The major tools in this stage are data collection and analysis, Pareto Chart and 
Cause-and-Effect Diagram (Fishbone). The defective items are collected by QA inspectors. 
The types of defects are identified and presented as shown in Figure 3, then 
Cause-and-Effect Diagram (Fishbone) is used to analysis the causes of the defect. After 
several defective items been collected, a fishbone diagram is presented as shown in Figure 
4. It is found that the impurity of SS and Si share most of the impurity, followed by Stone, 
Tin and Zircon.

The benefits of the implementation are listed as the following. 
(1) The impurity loss reduced from 15 % to 5 %.  
(2) Through-put increased 10 %.  
(3) The frequency and numbers of sampling and manpower overtime payment for extra 
examination reduced.  
(4) The extra cost of clearing and handling of waste glass reduced.  
(5) Customer satisfaction and On-Time delivery Rate increased.  
 
4. CONCLUSION   
This research is to reduce impurity loss of TFT-LCD Substrate Glass by using six sigma 
management. The team members investigated from the beginning of batch raw material to 
all the melting processes. Thus, most of the potential factors of impurity were found, the 
possible root causes were analyzed and then improved. The impurity loss is reduced from 
15 % to 5 % by DMAIC approach. The production cost is reduced and the productivity is 
raised up.

ABSTRACT 
 
Six sigma management have been popularized because their successful 
implementations by many world-class enterprises around the world. In Taiwan, many 
domestic industries such as Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) 
panel, Semi-conductor, automobile and electronics, etc introduced six sigma 
management. Six sigma management becomes major stream for the improvement tools 
in the industries. Many cases study demonstrated that waste were eliminated and profits 
were increased by the implementation of six sigma management. 
The purpose of this research is to reduce impurity loss of TFT-LCD substrate 
Ggass by using six sigma management. The impurity loss was reduced from 10 % to 5 
% by the 5 steps, DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control), of six 
sigma management. The production cost was reduced and the productivity was raised 
up.
