Abstract 
 
In this project, a bird species recognition system based on their sounds is proposed. In this 
system, the birdsong of a bird species is segmented into many syllables, from which several 
primary frequency sequences can be obtained. By using the statistics of the principle frequency 
sequences, all the syllables are clustered with the fuzzy C-mean clustering method so that each 
syllable group can be modeled by a hidden Markov model (HMM) characterizing the features of 
the song of the bird species. Using the Viterbi algorithm, the recognition process is achieved by 
finding the template bird species that has the most probable HMMs matching the frequency 
sequences of the test birdsong. Experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve a 
recognition rate of over 78% for 420 kinds of bird species.

2.3. Syllable clustering 
 A birdsong is usually composed of many syllables 
but has only a few syllable patterns because of syllable 
repetitions. It is more practical to build an HMM for a 
group of similar syllables than each one of them. In 
this study, the fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering method 
was applied to cluster the syllables. Assume J syllables 
are obtained from the song of a bird species, denote the 
corresponding J principle frequency sequences as 
, then the statistic vector of jJj

The FCM algorithm was applied to cluster the statistic 
vectors of a birdsong when the variance of the statistic 
vectors was greater than a predefined threshold value. 
In the clustering process the optimal cluster number 
 was determined by using the WB index proposed 
in [10]. The principle frequency sequences of a 
syllable cluster were used to establish an HMM.

2.4. Construct HMMs for the bird species 
 In this study, a 3-stage ergodic fully connected 
HMM as shown in Fig 2 was utilized. The state-
transition probability matrix is denoted by , in 
which , 
33×A
ija 3,2,1=i , 3,2,1=j  are nonnegative. Since 
the training data are the principle frequency sequences 
of a syllable group, the principle frequencies form the 
possible observations of each state in the training 
process. Meanwhile, the possible principle frequencies 
(the frequency Bins) range from 0 to 255, so that the 
possible observations of each state were 
}255,...,2,1,0{=V . So in this study, to train an HMM 
is to determine the initial state probabilities iπ , 
3 ,2 ,1=i , the state transition probability matrix , 
and the state observation probability 
33×A
)}({ ki vbB = , 
  2550,1,2,...,=kv , 3 ,2 ,1=i , by using the principle 
frequency sequences (the observation sequences) of a 
syllable group. 
 Assume there are k principle frequency sequences 
in a syllable group represented by , 
then  forms the observation sequence set for 
training an HMM. To train the HMM parameters by 
using , a well-applied expectation maximization 
(EM) algorithm, called a Baum-Welch algorithm, was 
used [11]. After the training phase, each template bird 
species was modeled by some HMMs. To recognize a 
test birdsong, after extracting its principle frequency 
sequences, the principle frequency sequences in the 
same syllable cluster were linked as a single 
observation sequence with which the Viterbi algorithm 
could be applied to find the most probable HMM λ 
(bird species) that generates the sequence [11]. A test 
birdsong signal usually contains several syllable 
clusters resulting in several matching degrees of the 
most probable HMMs. These matching degrees were 
used for species recognition as demonstrated in the 
next section.
