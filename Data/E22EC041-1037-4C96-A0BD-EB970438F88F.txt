Abstract 
 Conventional rigid ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) has been used in hemiplegic subjects to 
improve gait function for almost thirty years.  However, hinged plantarflexion-stop ankle-foot 
orthoses (PSAFO) are suggested to be effective for patients with hemiparesis and weak ankle 
dorsiflexion to stabilize the ankle in the sagittle and coronal plane during ambulation. However, 
the changes of ankle spasticity in stroke patients during ambulation with PSAFO is not very 
clear. 
 Totally 14  CVA patients participated in this study.  They would walk about 6 meters in 
three conditions: (1) wearing only sports shoes.  (2) wearing sports shoes with zero-degree 
PSAFO (with neutral ankle) on the paretic side.  (3) wearing sports shoes with five-degree 
dorsiflexion PSAFO on the paretic side.  We measured the spasticity index proposed by Crenna 
(1992) and Lamontagne (2001) with muscle length-EMG activity relationship to quantify the 
spasticity during walking.  The gait cycles were recorded by the motion analysis system (Vicon 
250, Oxford, UK).  The EMG activities were recorded by surface electrodes (Gould Instrument 
Systems Inc., USA). 
 Results of present studies were: (1) the spasticity index between sound sides and 
paretic sides were significantly different at all conditions with and without PSAFO 
(p<0.001). (2) The spasticity index of the paretic side with five-degree AFO was 
significantly greater than that without AFO (p<0.01), and the spasticity index of zero-
degree AFO was not significantly different from that without PSAFO (p>0.05).  (3) 
PSAFO in zero and five-degree dorsiflexion could improve the loading response, but the pre-
swing phase with five-degree PSAFO was significantly reduced.  The major conclusion is that 
zero-degree AFO is a good prescription for stroke patients to enhance the walking ability.

Chapter 1. Introduction 
 Project Motivation 
 Stroke, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is defined as sudden, focal neurological 
disorder resulting from ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions in the brain (Susan B. O'Sullivan 1994). 
Most CVA patients are turning into hemiplegia. Hemiplegic gait is characterized by slow speed 
and poorly coordinated movements.  Individuals with CVA are always prescribed by AFOs.  
Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) has been used in hemiplegic subjects to improve gait function for 
over thirty years.  AFOs are worn by person with hemiplegia to correct gait abnormalities such 
as foot drop during swing phase and insufficient push-off during stance phase (Lehmann, 
Esselman et al. 1983).  A large number of studies have shown that they can produce beneficial 
effects in patients with hemiplegia(Burdett, Borello-France et al. 1988; Susan B. O'Sullivan 
1994; Gok, Kucukdeveci et al. 2003).  Particularly, AFOs may result in an increase in walking 
speed(Hesse, Luecke et al. 1996) and a reduction in pain(Beckerman, Becher et al. 1996). 
Spasticity is the main problem effecting individual with CVA. Spasticity (stretch reflex 
excitibility) is also the major cause of motor control deficits resulting from central nervous 
system problem.  Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by (1) exaggerated tendon 
jerk(hyper-reflexia) and (2) increased muscle response to applied stretch, positively correlated 
with the lengthening rate (velocity-dependent hypertonia)(R.G. Feldmann 1990).  And, 
clinicians found significant differences among AFO in neutral and in 5 degree dorsiflexion and 
shoes only.  However, lack of evidence support that AFO can reduce muscle tone. Therefore, the 
purpose of this study is to quantify the spasticity to determine if the AFO with different ankle 
angle effect the spasticity.

well as the ability to transfer weight onto the forefoot in preparation for push-off. There may be 
continued excessive or diminished dorsiflexion at the ankle joint. Lack of heel rise can be 
observed combined with excessive dorsiflexion, and contralateral leg makes initial contact early. 
Preswing phase: The final stance stage and the second double support period, a lack of knee 
flexion(normally between 30 and 40 degrees) is often observed, as is lack of ankle joint 
plantarflexion at the end of preswing(Susan B. O'Sullivan 1994).  
Swing phase: The paretic limb can sometimes be seen as a mass flexion movement instead of a 
series of sequential flexion movements(Lehmann, Condon et al. 1987). More often it is 
characterized by stiff-legged swing, with a decrease in hip flexion and in the velocity and 
amount of reciprocal knee flexion and extension. Circumduction is seen when the patient 
swings the leg through in a semicircle. It is most noticeable when looking at the patient in the 
frontal plane. The “toe drag” is seen in this phase may continue because of the decreased knee 
swing but may also be a consequence of decreased hip flexion and decreased ankle dorsiflexion. 
Frontal plane:  
Either excessive lateral trunk lean over the ipsilateral leg during midstance or a positive 
Trendelenberge’s sign may be observed, both of which indicate weak hip abductors of the 
stance leg. A positive Trendelenberge’s sign is present when excessive lateral displacement of 
the pelvis occurs over the stance leg, with an excessive lowering of the pelvis on the 
contraleteral swing leg.

1.2.2  Studies of AFO and Other Othoses in CVA 
 In the past 30 years, many types of orthosis were invented to be presented to the public. 
Polypropylene AFO, leaf spring, metallic AFO, anterior type AFO, AFO with tone-reducing 
features…etc were used to correct the deformity and reducing spasticity of individual with CVA.  
Mario T.  Balmaseda, MD  studied normal subjects with and without AFO.  The result shows 
that a significant reduction in the mean duration of the stance phase with the AFO. And he 
suggested some changes( trajectory of COP, vertical force…etc ) which should be kept in mind 
when prescribing an AFO.(Balmaseda, Koozekanani et al. 1988)  Burdett, PhD reported that 
Air-stirrup brace (Fig. 1.1 a) in control inversion and eversion instability in patients with 
hemiplegia are effective. And conventional AFO or air-stirrup brace were not affecting gait 
speed, time, and distance characteristics, except that paretic-side step length increased 
statistically significant(Burdett, Borello-France et al. 1988).   
Alice M. K. and Wong, MD (1992) reported that low-temperature plastic AFO (Fig. 1.1 
b) that can be rapidly molded and remolded to fit the foot in most positions is suitable for 
walking barefoot and with shoes.  Furthermore, it can also be used for positioning of the 
paralyzed foot in bed; therefore, they reported that it is a new modification of AFO with 
additional application(Wong, Tang et al. 1992).   
Kenji Hachisuka (1998) reported that subjective evaluations by the patients(CVA) 
indicated  that dorsi-assisted AFO (Fig. 1.1 c) was as good as a shoehorn type AFO in walking 
on flat and sloped surfaces, though its weight, noise, and appearance caused by the cylinder of 
the dorsi-assisted AFO were regarded as poor(Hachisuka, Ogata et al. 1998).   
Chiung-Ling Chen, OT (1999) reported that anterior type AFO (Fig. 1.1 d) could 
improve the “dynamic stability” of lateral weight shifting. (Chen, Yeung et al. 1999). 
 By 2003, Haydar Gok reported that both Seattle type and metallic AFO (Fig. 1.1 e)

1.2.3 Biomechanics of AFO 
Ankle-foot orthoses (AFO) are used for patients with hemiparesis and weak ankle 
dorsiflexion, and may stabilize the ankle in the sagittle and coronal plane during balance and 
gait.  Individuals with hemiparesis would like to have more mobility; therefore, drop foot, 
inversion, and stretch reflex excitability (spasticity) should be solved.  Patients of spastic 
condition is the main type in CVA population.  AFO with plantarflexion stop (PSAFO) is often 
prescribed for spastic CVA gait.  The mechanisms of plantarflexion-stop AFO (PSAFO) are 
proposed as (1) to prevent foot drop in sagittle plane (Fig 1.2 a ), the four-force system provides    
(2) to correct medial-lateral stability in coronal plane(Fig 1.2 b ), (3) to stabilize the calf muscle 
and  position ankle in neutral avoiding muscle contracture.

spasticity relate to the static condition, evaluating the mechanical or the electromyographic 
response to stretch of the muscle at rest or under a static contraction (Herman R 1968; Powers 
RK 1988; Lehmann JF 1989).  The expression of spasticity in the resting muscle, however, 
differs from that observed under dynamic conditions(Neilson PD 1973).  Consequently, the 
reliability of  these static assessments are questionable. (Crenna P 1992; Crenna 1998).  The use 
of the method proposed by Crenna Paul (1998) for the measurement of spasticity in soleus and 
hamstring muscles during gait of children with CP revealed abnormalities either in the gain or 
the velocity threshold of the muscle electromyographic recruitment(Crenna 1998). 
Lamontagne(2001) measured spasticity of medial gastrocnemius(MG) during gait in subjects 
with CVA by using the method proposed originally by Crenna.  By using a linear regression 
approach, the slope of the relationship between electromyographic activity and muscle 
lengthening-velocity is calculated to provide a quantitative estimate of the expression of 
hyperactive stretch reflexes (spasticity) during gait. He found that the slope of the 
electromyography–lengthening velocity plots of the medial gastrocnemius obtained during the 
stance phase is positive in paretic side(CVA) and negative in nonparetic(CVA) or 
control(normal) side(Fig 1.3).

1.3 Hypotheses and Objectives  
Hypotheses 
1.  PSAFO with neutral ankle can reduce ankle spasticity during ambulation. 
2.  PSAFO with 5 degree dorsiflexion can reduce ankle spasticity more than that with neutral 
ankle. 
  
Objectives 
1. To determine the “locomotor-specific spasticity” of medial gastrocnemius in CVA with 
PSAFO in deferent angle (zero-degree, five- degree dorsiflexion) and without AFO. 
2. To assess the gait pattern with PSAFO in different angle (zero-degree, five- degree 
dorsiflexion) and without PSAFO.

Fig.  2.1  Landmarks on the stockinet 
 
And measure some anthropometry data as follows: 
  (1) Width of first and fifth metatarsal head 
  (2) Width of medial and lateral malleolus 
  (3) Height of distal end of medial malleolus 
 
Finally, we put the knee of CVA patient in flexion position to facilitate the ankle to remain 
neutral position. The neutral position is defined as the angle between the mid-line of the shank and 
the parallel line of the fifth metatarsal (Cynthia C. Norkin 1996) as shown in Fig. 2.2.  The five 
degree dorsiflexion will be made by a plastic block inserted between the plantarflexion stops as 
shown in Fig. 2.7.   This step will be done after the PSAFO is completed.  After the neutral position 
is defined, clinicians wrap casting tapes on the patient’s foot ankle and the shank to make a negative 
mold.  Clinician applied forces to make the knee in flexion position and ankle in neutral position 
before the casting tapes dry.  And hold the heel aligned with the shank in a line.  After the casting 
tapes dry, the negative mold is finished (Fig. 2.3).  
 
 19
2.4.2 Cast Modification  
There are several important principles to follow when orthotists modify positive mold in 
NRERC.  A positive mold with bony landmarks is shown in Fig. 2.4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.4 A positive mold with bony landmarks 
 
  Orthotists should judge the trim lines of the AFO first according to experiences.  The trim 
line of ankle is forward of the lateral and medial malleolus to include the two malleolus.  The upper 
trim line of AFO is 2 centimeter below the fibular neck.  The medial trim line should cover the 
whole arch and medial metatarsal head to support the arch and to prevent adduction, respectively.  
The lateral trim line covers the fifth metatarsal head as well to be the counterforce.  The trim line of 
anterior part of the foot plate is just before the toes.   
The sustentaculum tali will be modified to supply corrective force in the sense that to hold 
the heel aligned with the shank.  To let the patient easy to done and doff, flare anterior part of the 
mold is important as well.  The malleolus parts should be build up to prevent the abrasion.  The 
upper part is also flared to minimize the pressure of the edge. The final shape of positive mold is 
shown in Fig. 2.5.  The mold has been modified much more symmetry and smoothed.  After drying, 
the AFO could be fabricated.

2.4.4  Fitting 
 The last step of the procedures is fitting which is to make sure the AFO is comfortable on 
CVA patients.  First, put the AFO on the patient and to check if there is any excessive pressure on 
bony landmarks such as malleoli, fibular head, heel, navicular, and metatarsal heads.  Using a heat 
gun to heat the AFO if there is any uncomfortable on above location.  Then cut the strap to suitable 
length.  Third, trim the anterior part of the foot plate to meet the size of the patient’s shoes.  Finally, 
add the plastic block on the stops to let the AFO in 5 degrees dorsiflexion position to check it could 
be removable.

The length of any given muscle 
                               Resting fiber length of the muscle when body is in the anatomic position  
The joint angle for a single joint muscle (ankle angle in this research) 
The joint angle for the adjacent joint for biarticulate muscle (knee angle in this research) 
 
By inputting the angle 1 2( ) ( )t and tθ θ  , the length of any given muscle with respect to time 
could be calculated. If the given muscle is fiber-parallel, the velocity of this muscle is the same as 
the velocity of the length of the muscle.   
 
 
 
The velocity of parallel fiber muscle  
         If the chosen muscle is pennated, the following equations will be used. Fisrt, the length of the 
muscle will be modified by equation 3 and 4, and then differentiate it to obtain the modified 
lengthening velocity. Because that the orientation of pennated fibers are ( )tpα  between the 
orientation of muscle origin and insertion. Hence, equation 3 and 4 are used to calculate the 
effective muscle length with respect to time. In our research, 0α of  the medial gastrocnemius is 
8o and 0l  is 0.25 body height (David Winter ).

Chapter 3. Results 
3.1   Demographic data  
           Fourteen stroke patients (9 left hemiparesis and 5 right hemiparesis) with duration of illness 
being 2 to 37 months participated in this study. All the subjects were able to walk without any aids, 
including PSAFO. Passive ankle range of motion could exceed 80% of the contralateral side. 
Clinical evaluation was assessed by two indices as follows.  (1) Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS): 1 
subject was in grade 1 (mild spasticity), 8 subjects were in grade 2 (moderate spasticity), 4 subjects 
were in grade 3 (moderate spasticity) and 1 subject in grade 4 (strong spasticity).   (2) Brunnstron 
stage of lower extremities: 2 subjects were in grade 3 (synergistic stage), 8 subjects were in grade 4 
(deviation from synergistic pattern) and 4 subjects were in grade 5 (having isolated joint movement).   
3.2    Lengthening velocity and EMG responses during stance phase 
Figures 3.1 ~ 3 show the mean responses of all subjects (n=14) during stance phase in one gait

muscle lengthening of medial gastrocnemius (MG), the second curves indicate the lengthening 
velocity of muscle, and the third curves indicate the amplitude of EMG (%max).  The scatter plots

of EMG burst occurs around the foot flat (i.e., early stance).  Fourth, the electromyography-
lengthening velocity property (i.e., slope in the bottom plot) is significantly different (p <

  Lengthening velocity and EMG responses during stance phase with Zero- 
degree PSAFO 
The mean responses of muscle lengthening, lengthening velocity and EMG activities in 
14 stroke patients for sound side with zero-degree PSAFO on the paretic side (SZ) and for 
paretic side with zero-degree PSAFO (PZ) during stance phase are shown in Figure 3.2.  In 
Figure 3.2.A, the sound side shows that the activation of the medial gastrocnemius (third curve) 
increases with the lengthening of the muscle (first curve), while the paretic side (Fig 3.2.B) is 
opposite that it decreases with the increase of the muscle lengthening (first curve) in patients 
walking with zero-degree PSAFO. Furthermore, the activation of the medial gastrocnemius 
(third curve) increases with the decrease of lengthening velocity of the muscle (second curve) in 
the sound side (Fig 3.2.A), while the paretic side (Fig 3.2.B) is opposite that it decreases with 
the decrease of the muscle lengthening velocity (second curve).  Those responses are similar to 
those mentioned above without wearing PSAFO on the paretic side (Fig 3.1).  
The four characteristics between sound side and paretic side in subjects wearing the 
zero-degree PSAFO (Fig. 3.2) are quite similar to those mentioned above without PSAFO (Fig. 
3.1). The electromyography-lengthening velocity property (slope) is significantly different as 
well (p < 0.001).  As shown in Fig. 3. 4, The slope of sound side is negative 
( 1
0
%100 49.95( )L s−⋅− ± ), while the paretic side is positive ( 10%99.86 43.88( )L s−⋅± ).  However, as 
compared with those without zero-degree PSAFO on the paretic limb (first curves in Fig. 3.1.B), 
the beginning of lengthening curve of MG muscle (first curves in Fig. 3.2.B) decreases and 
increases slowly with longer interval for heel strike and foot flat in subjects with zero-degree 
PSAFO.  It indicates that zero-degree PSAFO causes the heel contact to mid-stance slowly.  
Second, the lengthening period during stance phase is short.  
 37
3.2.3 Lengthening velocity and EMG responses during stance phase with Five- 
degree PSAFO 
The mean responses of muscle lengthening, lengthening velocity and EMG activities in 
14 stroke patients for sound side with five-degree PSAFO on the paretic side (SF) and for 
paretic side with five-degree PSAFO (PF) during stance phase are shown in Fig. 3.3.  In Fig. 
3.3.A, the sound side shows that the activation of the medial gastrocnemius (third curve) 
increases with the lengthening of the muscle (first curve), while the paretic side (Fig. 3.3.B) is 
opposite that it decreases with the increase of the muscle lengthening (first curve) in patients 
walking with five-degree PSAFO. Furthermore, the activation of the medial gastrocnemius 
(third curve) increases with the decrease of lengthening velocity of the muscle (second curve) 
in the sound side (Fig. 3.2.A), while the paretic side (Fig. 3.3.B) is opposite that it decreases 
with the decrease of the muscle lengthening velocity (second curve).  Those responses are 
similar to those mentioned above without wearing PSAFO on the paretic side (Fig. 3.1).  
The four characteristics between sound side and paretic side in subjects wearing the 
five-degree PSAFO (Fig. 3.3) are quite similar to those mentioned above without PSAFO (Fig. 
3.1). The electromyography-lengthening velocity property (slope) is significantly different as 
well (p < 0.001).  As shown in Fig. 3. 4, The slope of sound side is negative 
( 1
0
%98.71 38.1( )L s−⋅− ± ), while the paretic side is positive ( 10%135.86 54.21( )L s−⋅± ).  However, as 
compared with those without PSAFO on the paretic limb (first curves in Fig. 3.1.B), the 
beginning of lengthening curve of MG muscle (first curves in Fig. 3.3. B) decreases and 
increases slowly with longer interval for heel strike and foot flat in subjects with five-degree 
PSAFO.  It indicates that five-degree PSAFO causes the heel contact to mid-stance slowly. 
Second, the amplitude of EMG during the final portion of stance phase in wearing five-degree 
PSAFO is higher than those without PSAFO.   
 39
3.3 Comparison of spasticity index during stance phase with and 
without PSAFO 
 
Fig. 3.4 shows the results of comparisons of  the slopes (i.e., Spasticity Index) among three 
conditions (none, zero-degree and five-degree PSAFO) of sound side (S) and paretic side (P). The 
slopes of the sound side in three conditions (SN, SZ, and SF) are negative which are 100 49.95− ± , 
98.7 38.1− ±  and 92.6 26.8− ± 1
0
%( )L s−⋅  , respectively (Fig. 3.4).  The negative slopes indicate that 
the medial gastrocnemius activation level decreases with the increase of lengthening velocity (i.e., 
nonvelocity-sensitive). The slopes of the paretic side in three conditions (PN, PZ and PF) are 
positive which are 99.86 43.9± , 135.86 54.21± , 68.4 48.54± 1
0
%( )L s−⋅ , respectively (Fig. 3.4). The 
positive slopes indicate that the paretic sides are velocity-sensitive.  
Two-way analysis indicated there are significant main effect of sides (sound vs. paretic sides 
with F=7.52, df=2, p<0.001) and conditions (none vs. zero-degree PSAFO vs. five-degree PSAFO 
with F=11.29, df=2, p<0.001). There are also significant effect of interaction (F=205.16, df=1, 
p<0.001). Therefore, the slopes between sound sides and paretic sides are significantly different at 
all three conditions (p<0.001). Post hoc analysis indicates that the slope of the paretic side with 
five-degree AFO is greater than that without AFO (p<0.01), and the slope of zero-degree AFO is 
not significantly different from that without PSAFO (p>0.05) (Fig. 3.4).

3.4 EMG firing pattern during stance phase with and without   
PSAFO 
Fig.3.5~7 shows the raw, filtered and integrated EMG of left and right MG muscle 
activities of one subject with PSAFO.  Those raw signals are integrated and plotted versus the 
stance phase of gait cycle and it shows higher EMG activities with PSAFO, especially five-degree 
PSAFO (Fig.3.8).  Fig.3.9 shows the mean EMG activities of paretic side in three conditions (n=14) 
It is possible that we separate these three curves by a dotted line at 12% into two sections, i.e., 
initial response and subsequent response. The initial response has an early burst in these three 
conditions.  However, in the third condition (PF), the burst is markedly smaller than the other two 
(PN, PZ).  Furthermore, the trend of EMG activity burst in subsequent response is downward in PN 
and PZ conditions, while the trend of EMG activity burst is upward in PF condition.

3.5 Comparison of kinematic data during stance phase    
Tables 3.1~3 show the gait cycle divisions of stance phase of paretic limb with and without 
PSAFO.  The percentage of loading response in three conditions (PN, PZ, PF) are,5.4±6.4, 
21.0±7.5and 28.0±11.4 (% stance phase), respectively (Table 3.1~Table 3.3).  The loading duration 
is significantly (p<0.001) less in PN than those in PZ and PF (Fig. 3.6). The midstance-terminal-
stance phase as well as pre-swing phase in PF are significantly (p<0.05) less than that in PN (Fig. 
3.6).

(2001) showed that the muscle lengthening velocity-sensitive electromyographic responses of 
medial gastrocnemius indicats the hyperactive stretch reflexes (i.e., spasticity) during stance phase 
in gait cycle.  They found that the activation of medial gastronemius increased with the lengthening 
of the muscle, but the high lengthening velocity coexisted with low plantarflexor activation levels 
(which resulted in negative slope of velocity-EMG relationship) during the stance phase in 
nonparetic limb.  They also found thatIn contrast, only an early activation of medial gastronemius 
increased with the lengthening of the muscle, and the high lengthening velocity coexisted with high 
plantarflexor activation levels (which resulted in positive slope of velocity-EMG relationship) 
during the stance phase in paretic limb.  In fact, the muscle activation on sound side is length-
dependent whereas the paretic side is velocity-sensitive..  Our results in stroke patients without 
wearing PSAFO also showed similar responses (Fig. 3.1 and Fig. 3.4 ).   The electromyography-
lengthening velocity scatter plots (spasticity index) are positive in paretic limb, while patients’ 
without (unbraced ) and with PSAFO on paretic limb (Fig. 3.1-Fig. 3.3).  Therefore, the paretic side 
was velocity dependent, which correlates with the characteristics of spasticity.  
When patient wore the zero-degree PSAFO, the spasticity index was higher non-
significantlyly, compared to that without-PSAFO condition ( 1
0
%68.36 99.86 L sto −⋅ ).  When patient 
wore the five-degree dorsiflexion PSAFO, the spasticity index was higher significantly compared to 
that withoutPSAFO condition ( 1
0
%
,
68 .36 135.86 0.01L sto p−⋅ < ).  Thus, the CVA patients with the 
five-degree PSAFO would increase the spasticity signjficantly, not the one with zero-degree 
PSAFO. 
4.3  Effect of PSAFO on EMG firing pattern 
As in the spastic activation pattern (Type1.) proposed by Knuttson and Richards (1980), the 
premature activation of plantarflexor occurring during the lengthening period of the calf muscles 
was observed on the paretic side(Knutsson E 1980).  In our research, we also found that 
 51
However, the pre-swing phase in five-degree PSAFO was significantly (p<0.05) less than that 
without PSAFO (Fig. 3.6) and normal control value from other studies  (Margareta Nordin 2001).  
Therefore, the zero-degree PSAFO may be more appropriate than five-degree PSAFO for 
improving gait pattern in stroke patients.  
 
 
4.5 Mechanism of PSAFO on Spasticity 
The hinged AFO (dynamic ankle-foot orthosis), not the conventional solid AFO, allows 
normal weight-bearing on the plantar surface throughout stance (Glen Gillen 1998).   Present study 
chose posterior stopped hinged AFO for stroke patients and hoped to inhibit hyperactive reflexes by 
prolonged stretch of the spastic plantarflexors.  However, present results indicated PSAFO 
increased the spasticity index in stroke patients, especially in subjects wearing five-degree PSAFO.  
The tone-inhibiting effect of AFOs is based on hypothesis formulated on the basis by serial casting 
on spasticity and abnormal tone  (Diamond and Ottenbacher 1990). However, the evidence of a 
central inhibiting effect of prolonged stretch by inhibitive casting is inconclusive (White, Yack et al. 
1989). Changes in sarcomere number, connective tissue, and muscle length due to immobilization, 
positioning, and stretch can influence muscle contraction force, and the manifestation of 
hyperreflexia (Carr and Shephard 1995). Perhaps it is these mechanical properties of muscle that are 
influenced by tone-inhibiting orthosis.  By Promoting biomechanical alignment and normal muscle 
length, these AFOs may exert an effect on peripheral rather than central factors, that over time could 
otherwise augment stretch reflexes.  Therefore, Until now, tone-inhibiting effect of PSAFOs is 
controversial (Glen Gillen 1998).  
As mentioned above, we propose that the mechanisms of PSAFO on spasticity can be

pattern in nonparetic limbs.  The five-degree PSAFO increases the spasticity index significantly 
(Fig.3.4), and the increase of the excitability of stretch reflex may be due to the decrease of stretch 
reflex threshold.

4.8 Future works 
Our research is a first step toward the investigation of the effects of PSAFO on stroke 
patients. It would be of interest to study the spasticity on stroke patients with dorsiflexion-assisted 
free-motion AFO or dorsiflexion-assisted plantarflexion-stop AFO when walking, crossing obstacle, 
even sit-to stand. Further research is needed, especially long-term, controlled studies, to investigate 
the many variables that influence motor control and muscle function.

A Mathematical Model 
of Spine Flexibility 
for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
Liang-Wey Chang, Ph.D. and Jiun-Ren Shie, M.S.
Institute of Biomedical Engineering 
Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center 
National Taiwan University
Taipei, Taiwan
For The 13th International Meeting on Advanced 
Spine Techniques (2006 IMAST)
Research Objective
• To apply the engineering definition of 
structural flexibility to spine
• To develop a mathematical model of the 
spine flexibility 
• To predict the outcome of in-brace curve 
corrections for adolescent idiopathic 
scoliosis (AIS) patients. 
Results
• The average age when bracing began was 
14.48 years (SD=2.16, range=11.08-17.42).  
The average height was 155.5 cm (SD=9.05, 
range=140-164).  The average weight is 44.3 
kg (SD=8.35, range=26-58).  The average 
prebrace Cobb angle was 36.8° (SD=13.04, 
range=25°-66°). 
• The calculated flexibility of each patient

Flex. 3.44 1.30 1.82 2.13 8.83 1.94 5.41 1.80 5.74 1.07
Results
• The predictive correction was calculated 
according to the flexibility definition
Discussion 
• The magnitude of scoliosis curves highly positively 
correlate with flexibility.
• The results showed that AIS patient with greater pre-
brace Cobb angles, younger age, shorter in heights and 
smaller scales of Risser signs had greater spine 
flexibility.
• Three steps to predict AIS patients’ correction:
– 1. Apply proper corrective force to AIS patients according to 
patients’ pressure tolerance.
– 2. Calculate AIS patients’ flexibility by the regression equation.
– 3. predict the treatment outcome by simple algebraic calculation: 
Correction = Flexibility × Corrective Force
Conclusions 
• The model was able to predict the outcome of in-
brace correction. 
• This research provided a new definition of spine 
flexibility which we believe is essential in order to 
develop a useful model. 
• The model in turn enables an accurate 
prediction of the in-brace curve correction 
outcome. 
• The predicted outcome would guide clinicians 
and patients to make right decisions and 
treatment plans.
