Abstract: In practice, vendors (or sellers) often offer their buyers a fixed credit period to
settle the account. The benefits of trade credit are not only to attract new buyers but also to
avoid lasting price competition. On the other hand, the policy of granting a permissible
delay adds not only an additional cost but also an additional dimension of default risk to
vendors. In this research, we will incorporate the fact that granting a permissible delay has
a positive impact on demand but negative impacts on both costs and default risks to
establish vendor-buyer supply chain models. We will use a couple of numerical examples
to show that (1) granting a permissible delay may significantly improve profits for both the
vendor and the buyer, and (2) the sensitivity analysis on the optimal solution with respect
to each parameter.

1. INTRODUCTION
In practice, vendors usually offer their buyers a delay period in payment. During the
period, there is no interest charge. Hence, buyers can earn the interest from sales income
meanwhile vendors lose the interest earned during the same time. However, if the payment
is not paid in full by the end of the permissible delay period, then vendors charge buyers an
interest on the outstanding amount. The permissible delay in payment produces two
benefits to the vendor: (1) it attracts new buyers who consider it to be a type of price
reduction, and (2) it may be applied as an alternative to price discount because it does not
provoke competitors to reduce their prices and thus introduce lasting price reductions. On
the other hand, the policy of granting credit terms adds not only an additional cost but also
an additional dimension of default risk to the vendor.
Goyal (1985) first developed an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for the buyer
when the seller offers a fixed permissible delay period. Shah (1993) considered a stochastic
inventory model when delays in payments are permissible. Jamal et al. (1997) extended
Goyal’s model to alow for shortages. Hwang and Shinn (1997) added the pricing strategy 
to the model, and derived the optimal price and lot sizing for a retailer under the condition
of permissible delay in payments. Teng (2002) provided an alternative conclusion from
Goyal (1985), and proved that it makes economic sense for a well-established buyer to
order less quantity and take the benefits of the permissible delay more frequently. Chang et
al. (2003) developed an EOQ model for deteriorating items under supplier credits linked to
ordering quantity. Huang (2003) extended Goyal’s model to develop an EOQ model in 
4n the vendor’s number of deliveries per production cycle to the buyer which is a positive integer (vendor’s decision variable)
D = D(m) the buyer’s annual demand rate which is a function of m, with D < R.
t the buyer’s replenishment cycle time in yearswhich is a real number(buyer’s decision variable).
Q the buyer’s order quantity.
iTP the i’s annual expected total profit, with i = v and b.
*m the vendor’s optimal credit period.
*n the vendor’s optimal number of deliveries per production cycle.
*t the buyer’s optimalreplenishment cycle time.
*Q the buyer’s optimal order quantity *Dt .
B. Assumptions:
Next, the following assumptions are made to establish the mathematical inventory
model.
1.In today’s global competition, many retailers have no pricing power. As a result, the
selling price is hardly changed for many retailers. In addition, to avoid lasting price
competition,we may assume WLOG that the seling price is constant in today’s global 
competition and low inflation environment.
2.As stated in Jaggi et al. (2008), “it is observed that credit period offered by the retailer
to its customers has a positive impact on demand of an item.” For simplicity, we may
assume that the buyer’s demand rate D(m) with the vendor’strade credit of m periods is
given by
maKemD )( , (1)
where K and a are positive constants. For convenience, D(m) and D will be used
interchangeably.
3. Since the longer the credit period to the buyer, the higher the default risk, we may
assume WLOG that the rate of default risk giving the credit period m is
mbemf 1)( , (2)
where b is a positive constant.
4. If t m, then the buyer pays the entire purchase amount to the vendor at time m.
Otherwise, the buyer deposits sales revenue into an interest bearing account until m. At
the end of the permissible delay, the retailer pays off all units sold, uses unsold items as
collateral to apply for a loan, and pays the bank a certain amount of money periodically
until the loan is paid off at time t.
5. Replenishment rate is instantaneous and the lead time is negligible.
6. Shortages are not allowed to occur.
Now, we are ready to build up the mathematical models.
3. MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR EACH PLAYER
We establish the annual profit function for the vendor first, and then for the buyer.
A. Vendor’s annual profit
Since the vendor receives the buyer’s purchase amount at time m with the rate of default
risk mbemf 1)( , the vendor’s annual revenue is 
(Pv mbe ) mre D = KPv mrbae )]([  . (3)
6(b) If 0 , then the optimal replenishment cycle time is .*2 mt 
(c) If 0 , then the optimal replenishment cycle time is * *1 2t t = m.
Corollary 1. We may assume WLOG that b e b cP I C I . If b e b cP I C I , then we have
(1) A higher value of Sb causes a higher value of , t* and Q*.
(2) A higher value of K, a, m, and Hb causes a lower value of , t* and Q*.
B. Nash solution for the vendor
We take the first and second derivatives of TPv (m, n) with respect to m and n, and
obtain

Step 1. Set i =1, t0= 0, m1 = 0 (or any given number), and n1 =1 (or any given integer).
Step 2. If 22 ( ) 0b i b b eS Dm H P I   , then use (13), (6), and (5) to obtain ti, TPb (ti), and
TPv (mi, ni), respectively. Otherwise, use (14), (7), and (5) to obtain ti, TPb (ti), and TPv

Step 3. If ti = ti-1, then stop. Otherwise, set j =1,j = mi,j = ni, and go to Step 4.
Step 4. Substitute ti (as t) andj (as m) into (21) to havej+1.(as n) Then Substitute ti (as t),
