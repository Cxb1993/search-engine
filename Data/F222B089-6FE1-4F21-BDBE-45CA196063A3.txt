Extensive related details of the discretization schemes consisting of inside fine/coarse 
grid-areas and the associated immersed boundary method may be found in Peng et al.14,1. It is 
also noted that an extensive validation of the underlying method has been well-documented in 
Peng et al.14,1. A sketch for the computational domain with implemented boundary conditions 
and a side-byside arrangement of two elliptic cylinders is provided in Fig. 1. Various 
domain-lengths used for simulations under the present study are defined as: L1 = 5Ly, L2 = 
50Ly, L3 = 12Ly, L4 = 4Ly, L5 = 8Ly, and L6 = 5.5Ly, facilitating generation of a physical 
domain of size 55Ly × 24Ly, consisting an inner fine-grid (Grid2) area 12Ly × 11Ly. Upon 
taking yx   =0.1Ly for the outer Grid1 (the coarse grid), and yx   =0.05Ly f for the 
inner Grid2, the total grid size became 168,000, with Grid1 = 120,000, and Grid2 = 48,000.

A. Hysteresis scenario with transition from in-phase to anti-phase patterns 
To investigated the transition of in-phase/anti-phase synchronized forms in flows past a 
pair of elliptic cylinders (A=2), two sets of computations including anti-phase and in-phase 
branches are first carried out. The anti-phase branch started from the anti-phase vortex 
shedding flow at G=3.0 and Re=100 and are calculated by progressively decreasing G in very 
small steps. In the meanwhile, the in-phase branch started from the in-phase vortex shedding 
flow at G=2.0 and Re=100 and are calculated by progressively increasing G in small steps. 
The observed distinctive physical properties of these flows are sequentially characterized in 
Table 1. It is noted that in anti-phase branch, the solution at a higher G is used as the initial 
condition for the next lower G. Similarly, in in-phase branch, the solution at a lower G is used 
as the initial condition for the next higher G.  
Table 1(a) Numerical results of flow past a pair of side-by-side ellipses by decreasing G slowly (A=2, 
Re=100). * denotes the computed case where transition is happen.

The flow past twin ellipses at constant Reynolds number (Re=100) retains anti-phase 
vortex shedding synchronized forms at high gap ratio ( 3.026.2 G ), as indicated by our 
extracted data on Table 1. Once G is decreased to G=2.24, the anti-phase vortex shedding 
flow transits to the in-phase synchronized vortex shedding form. For clarity, the existence of 
the anti-phase vortex shedding flow pattern (at Re=100, A=2, and G=2.32) is exhibited in Fig. 
2(a). It reveals clearly the anti-phase vortex shedding behavior of the simulated flow in the 
sub-domain x=[−5, 50], y=[−9, 9]. The continuation of zero central-line velocity [Fig. 2(d)], 
and perfectly anti-phase synchronized growth of the lift (CL,1, CL,2) coefficients [Figs. 2(b) and 
2(c)] ensure the inherent anti-phase characteristic of vortex shedding [Fig. 2(a)] in the wake. 
Note that, unlike for in-phase vortex shedding flow (Figs. 3 and 4), the equal but opposite 
natured variations of CL,1 and CL,2 in the present case contribute to the continued vanishing of 
CL,1+2 [Fig. 2(d)] during the entire time-evolution. The distinct physical symptoms associated 
with this anti-phase vortex shedding flow are further reflected in its phase-portraits [Figs. 2(e) 
and 2(f)]. Since the combined characteristics like near-wake Vc,x = 1.5 and CL,1+2 remained zero, 
the phase-space trajectories are conveniently presented in combinations of upper and lower 
cylinders lift and drag coefficients , CL,1 vs. CD,1 and CL,2 vs. CD,2. 
Upon maintaining anti-phase synchronized vortex shedding forms with the past findings 
related to side-by-side elliptical cylinders (A=2, Re=100, 3.026.2  G ), once the 
gap-ratio was subsequently increased (from 96.1G ), the in-phase synchronized vortex 
shedding were encountered behind the elliptic cylinders (A=2, Re=100, 58.296.1  G ). The 
6 
 
branch started from the in-phase vortex shedding flow at G=2.4 and Re=82 and are calculated 
by progressively increasing G in very small steps.

Fig. 6. The hysteresis region with Re of in-phase and anti-phase synchronized vortex 
shedding forms for flows past a pair of ellipses with A=2 at G=2.40. 
Again, as shown in Fig. 6, the CL,1+2 distribution along the anti-phase branch combines 
that along in-phase branch becomes a hysteresis loop. Particularly, the anti-phase branch 
starting from Re=160 trace along a straight segment, ending at Re=90, and then merges to the 
in-phase branch. While the in-phase branch starting from Re=82 trace along an oblique line, 
ending at Re=137, and again merges to the anti-phase branch.
