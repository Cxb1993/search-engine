Introduction
Owing to its wide band gap (3.37 eV) and large exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room
temperature, ZnO is believed to be a potential material for blue and uv optoelectronic
applications.1-3 ZnO exhibits a wurtzite structure and grows preferentially along the [0001]
direction. Therefore, c-plane ZnO films are conventionally obtained on most substrates.
However, devices based on (0001)-oriented wurtzite GaN are known to present spontaneous and
piezoelectric electrostatic fields. The existence of the internal electric field spatially separates
electrons and holes in the active layers, resulting in quantum-confined stark effect (QCSE) that
not only causes a reduction of the device quantum efficiency, but also leads to an undesirable red
shift in the emission spectra. It has been demonstrated that the electrostatic field of the GaN is
absent in the directions orthogonal to the [0001] polar axis.4 Research concerning the internal
electric field in the ZnO/Zn1-xMgxO quantum wells has attracted much attention as well due to the
promising photonic properties of ZnO crystal. Nevertheless, only few papers reported the
growth of the nonpolar ZnO layers, such as )0211(

(a-plane)5-7 or )0110(

(m-plane)8-10, which
is ascribed to the limitation of the available lattice-matched substrates.
Lattice match between the films and substrates is one of the crucial criterions for epitaxial
growth. Among all of the possible substrates, -LiAlO2 (100)10 and sapphire )0110(

11-12
(denoted as LAO and m-sapphire hereafter) have been employed to fabricate m-plane ZnO films.
In the case of m-sapphire substrate, the lattice constant along the c-axis sapphire is 12.991 Å
which is nearly four times of the lattice constant along the a-axis ZnO, 3.242 Å. The lattice
mismatch is only -0.18 %. Nevertheless, the other in-plane alignment between m-plane ZnO
films and m-sapphire, [0001]ZnO || ]0211[

sapphire, cZnO (5.194 Å) and asapphire (4.758 Å), possesses
a larger lattice mismatch of 8.39 %. Moriyama et al. reported on ZnO films grown on
m-sapphire using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy.11 They demonstrated that both ZnO
)0110(

and )3101(

orientations were observed on the m-sapphire at temperatures lower than
700 °C. The m-plane ZnO became dominant only when the growth temperature is increased to
800 °C.11 On the other hand, Chou et al. have demonstrated the growth of the nonpolar m-plane
ZnO epitaxial film on the LAO single crystal substrate via thermal chemical vapor deposition.10
LAO is considered to be a promising substrate for m-plane ZnO growth since the LAO (100)
plane exhibits a relatively small lattice mismatch to m-plane ZnO, namely [0001]ZnO || [010]LAO
with ~0.52 % and ]0211[

ZnO || [001]LAO with ~3.18 %. Apart from the small lattice mismatch,
other advantages, such as low melting point (1750 °C), easy processing due to its low hardness,
and able to be removed by chemical etching after ZnO growth,13 all make LAO an appropriate
substrate for the fabrication of the m-plane ZnO films.
electron microscopy (FESEM, JOEL JSM-6700F). The crystal structures of the Zn1-xMgxO
films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2000 and Rigaku Rint-2000)
and transmittance electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). The rocking curves of ZnO and
Zn1-xMgxO were also carried out by Rigaku Rint-2000. Optical properties of the Zn1-xMgxO
films were characterized by cathodoluminescence (CL, Gatan Mono-CL3, attached to the
FESEM, JOEL JSM-7000F).
Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the XPS results of the Zn1-xMgxO films grown on the LAO substrates at a Mg
source temperature of 215 °C. The high-resolution XPS scans of Zn 2p3/2 and Mg 2p taken on
the surface of the Zn1-xMgxO film are displayed in figures 1(a) and (b), respectively. Both peaks
show essentially symmetric peak shapes and are able to be fitted by one Gaussian peak. After
calibrated by the adventitious C 1s peak at 285.2 eV23, the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Mg
2p on the surface of the Zn1-xMgxO film are centered at 1021.9 eV and 49.5 eV, respectively.
The depth-profile analyses of the Zn 2p3/2 and Mg 2p scans of the Zn1-xMgxO films were also
performed to examine the uniformities of the composition throughout the film. As shown in
figures 1(c) and (d), the center positions of the calibrated Zn 2p3/2 and Mg 2p peaks at different
depths are identical to be at 1021.9 eV and 49.5 eV, respectively, indicating the superior
chemical-state uniformity throughout the Zn1-xMgxO films. In addition, Mg contents estimated
from the peak areas of Mg 2p to Zn 2p3/223 at layers from film surface to the interface with LAO
substrate, as shown in figure 1(e), are almost the same with an average of x = 0.113. This result
indicates the Mg content is quite uniform throughout the Zn1-xMgxO film. In the present work,
the x values of the Zn1-xMgxO films are determined by the average of the x values obtained from
depth-profile XPS measurements. It reveals that the Mg contents (x) of the Zn1-xMgxO films are
tunable from 0 to 0.113 by adjusting the partial pressures of the Mg sources in gas phase.
SEM images of the Zn1-xMgxO grown on the m-sapphire and LAO substrates are shown in
figures 2 and 3, respectively. As shown in figure 2(a), nanorods tilted an angle about 30 degree
to the normal of the m-sapphire substrate are obtained when the Mg source is absent. It has
been reported that single crystalline ZnO nanowires could be grown vertically on the a-plane
sapphire by taking advantage of the good epitaxial interface between the c-plane of ZnO and the
a-plane of sapphire.24 Since the angle between the m-plane and a-plane of sapphire is 30 degree,
as shown in figure 2(b), it is suggested that the growth direction of the ZnO nanorods shown in
figure 2(a) is still along c-axis. With an increase of the Mg content, figures 2(c)-(e) show that
the density of the nanorods decreases on the m-sapphire substrates. The rectangle-like blocks
dominate the Zn1-xMgxO film with x=0.113, however, the formation of a smooth Zn1-xMgxO film
m-plane Zn1-xMgxO become dominant as increasing x, indicating the encouragement of the
formation of the m-plane Zn1-xMgxO film on m-sapphire substrates as Mg concentration is large.
It has been reported that in the wurtzite Zn1-xMgxO crystal, the lattice constant a gradually
increases whereas the lattice constant c decreases with increasing Mg content as a result of the
substitution of Mg atoms for Zn atoms.16,25 For the growth of the m-plane ZnO epitaxial film on
the m-sapphire substrate, the lattice mismatch along ]0211[

ZnO and [0001]sapphire is only -0.18 %
(tension) while that of [0001]ZnO and ]0211[

sapphire is as large as 8.39 % (compression). When
Mg atoms are substituted for Zn atoms, the increase of the lattice constant a will make the strain
between the film and substrate from tension to compression which only change the mismatch
slightly. On the other hand, the decrease of the lattice constant c may reduce the mismatch
along [0001]ZnO || ]0211[

sapphire, which is relatively significant than the influence along
]0211[

ZnO || [0001]sapphire while growing the m-plane ZnO on m-sapphire substrates. Therefore,
we speculate that the substitution of Mg atoms for Zn atoms in wurtzite ZnO structures may
partially eliminate the lattice mismatch between the ZnO and m-sapphire substrates along
[0001]ZnO || ]0211[

sapphire, resulting in the )0110(

preferentially oriented Zn1-xMgxO film on the
m-sapphire substrates. However, the growth of large-area epitaxial m-plane ZnO films on the
m-sapphire substrates is not achievable in the present work, which is indicated by the presence of
the )3110(

diffraction peak in the XRD pattern.
Figure 4(b) presents the XRD patterns of the Zn1-xMgxO films grown on the LAO substrate
with various Mg contents. All patterns shown in this figure are calibrated by the position of the
LAO (100) peak. In contrast to those grown on m-sapphire substrates, only the diffraction
peaks of Zn1-xMgxO )0110(

and LAO (100) appear in the XRD patterns of the Zn1-xMgxO films
grown on the LAO substrates. It indicates that the Zn1-xMgxO films are grown preferentially
oriented in the m-axis direction on the LAO substrates in a Mg content range of 0 to 0.113. In
addition, there is no diffraction peak of MgO or metal Mg presenting in the XRD patterns,
suggesting that no MgO or Mg clusters exist throughout the as-grown Zn1-xMgxO films. The
Mg-content dependence of the a-axis lattice constants (d )0110(

value) is shown in the inset of
figure 4(b). It reveals that the a-axis lattice constant increases with the Mg concentrations,
which is consistent with the previous reports.16,25 The absence of the diffraction peaks of MgO
as well as Mg phases in the XRD patterns and the systematical dependence of the Mg content
with the lattice constant both suggest the Mg incorporated within the m-plane ZnO films by
means of substituting Zn. Furthermore, figure 4(c) shows the rocking curves of the ZnO and
Zn0.905Mg0.095O )0110(

films grown on the LAO substrates. The peaks are sharp and
symmetrical with FWHM of 0.361° and 0.365° for ZnO and Zn0.905Mg0.095O, respectively. This
addition to the strong UV emission, another UV emission (around 300-350 nm) and a visible
emission (475-525 nm) are also present in the spectra of the Zn1-xMgxO film. The former is
attributed to the CL emission of the LAO substrate and the latter might be caused by the oxygen
vacancies in the Zn1-xMgxO films. Strong UV emission peaks at 382, 377, 367, 362, 359, 357
and 352 nm are shown in the CL spectra of the Zn1-xMgxO films with x = 0, 0.012, 0.040, 0.068,
0.095, 0.104 and 0.113, respectively. An obvious blueshift of the near-band-edge emission
without significant change of FWHM are observed with increasing Mg content in the films.
This result indicates that the near-band-edge emission energies of the Zn1-xMgxO films measured
at room temperature increase monotonically with the Mg contents as shown in the inset of Figure
6.

Introduction
Because of its wide bandgap (3.37 eV) and large exciton binding energy (60 meV), zinc oxide is a
promising material that exhibits an efficiently exciton-governed luminescence in UV region at room
temperature. The development of ZnO-based optoelectronic devices has attracted a great deal of attention in
the recent decade.1-4 It has been reported that the existence of inherent strain originated from lattice mismatch
or variation of thermal expansion coefficients between substrate and epitaxial films would diminish the
illumination efficiency of optoelectronic devices.5-6 Therefore, it is essential to find a lattice-matched substrate
for the epitaxial growth of high quality ZnO films.
β-LiGaO2 (LGO) possesses an orthorhombic crystal structure (space group is Pna21 with lattice parameters:
a = 5.402 Å, b = 6.372 Å, and c = 5.007 Å)7 with the atomic arrangement of a wurtzite-like structure due to
the distortions introduced by the different sized metallic atoms. Since the lattice mismatch between [0001]GaN
and [001]LGO is known as only 1-2 %, LGO has been used as an alternative substrate for the epitaxial growth
of GaN.8-9 However, it has been demonstrated that the Ga2O3 and Ga rich phase of LiGa5O8 appear in the
LiGaO2 powders at above 1173 K, which is examined by X-ray powder diffraction, due to the volatilization of
the Li from the structure.10 MBE grown GaN has also shown significant lithium contamination due to
impurity diffusion from the substrate.11 These results indicate that LGO may not be stable for use as a
substrate for the growth of GaN. Nevertheless, it is believed that LGO may be a candidate for the epitaxial
growth of ZnO thin film since ZnO exhibits a wurtzite structure as GaN but lower growth temperature. Figure

surface termination.27-29 The definitions of surface termination and lattice polarity of bulk materials are
slightly different, however, these two denominations will be identical if inversion domain (ID) is absent.
Several reports have discussed the surface evolution as well as etching mechanism of ZnO (0002)Zn and
)2000(

O after acidic etching.27-28 The surface of the O-terminated ZnO is reactive with positively charged
ions such as protons (H+) or hydronium ions (H3O+) in the acidic solution because of the negative surface
charges. Nevertheless, the etching of O-terminated ZnO surface has been reported to form hexagonal
pyramids27 or hillocks.28 Due to these different etching features, it is speculated that the etching of
O-terminated ZnO does not originate from structural defects. In the contrary, the etching mechanism of
Zn-terminated ZnO is unfavorable due to the repulsion between the protons and the surface charge of Zn
atoms located on the top layer of Zn-terminated ZnO films. However, the protons could easily attack the
oxygen atoms with two dangling electrons under the Zn surface layer from the existence of holes or defects.
Consequently, etching could be promoted by the interaction of negatively charged oxygen ions with positively
charged protons.28-29 Hence, hexagonal pits appeared on the Zn-terminated ZnO surface after etching are also
used to estimate the density of dislocations in the films.27 In the present work, both CBED and chemical
etching are employed to determine the surface termination and polarity of as-deposited Zn1-xMgxO films.
Experimental
The LGO bulk crystal were grown using the Czochralski (Cz) technique with [001] c-axis pulling
direction30 and the LGO substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone for 20 min followed by
drying in N2 gas before growth. Zn1-xMgxO films were grown on the (001) LGO single-crystal substrates by
22
incorporations of Li element diffusing from LGO substrate at higher growth temperature,11 XPS scans of Li 1s
as well as Ga 2p 3/2 were also performed on the films. Consequently, no Li and Ga elements were detected,
indicating the formation of the high-purity Zn1-xMgxO films.
Figure 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the Zn1-xMgxO films with various Mg concentrations on the LGO
substrates. All of the XRD patterns are normalized and calibrated by the intensity and position of the LGO
(002) diffraction peak. In addition to LGO (002) and (004) peaks, only the diffraction peaks that pertain to
Zn1-xMgxO {0001} appear in the XRD patterns of the Zn1-xMgxO films. It indicates that the Zn1-xMgxO films
(x≤0.144) are grown preferentially oriented in the c-axis direction on the (001) LGO substrates. Furthermore,
there is no diffraction peak of MgO or metal Mg appears in the XRD patterns, implying that no MgO or Mg
cluster exists throughout the Zn1-xMgxO films. The dependence of the c-axis lattice constant (d{0002} value)
of the Zn1-xMgxO film on the Mg content is shown in the inset of Figure 2(a). It demonstrates that the c-axis
lattice constant decreases with increasing Mg concentrations, which is consistent with the previous
reports.32-33 The absence of the diffraction peaks of MgO as well as Mg phases in the XRD patterns and the
systematical dependence of the c-axis lattice constant on the Mg content both implicate Mg within the {0001}
ZnO films by means of substituting Zn. Figure 2(b) shows the rocking curves of the ZnO and Zn0.856Mg0.144O
(0001) films grown on the (001) LGO substrates. The peaks are sharp and symmetrical with FWHM of 0.424º
and 0.419º for ZnO and Zn0.856Mg0.144O, respectively. The FWHM values of Zn1-xMgxO films indicate the
high crystalline qualities of the ZnO films grown on the LGO substrates even after Mg incorporation.
Further structural characterizations of the {0001} Zn1-xMgxO films were performed by TEM. Figure 3(a)
shows a cross-section image of the {0001} Zn0.856Mg0.144O film grown on (001) LGO substrate taken along
the ]0211[

from surrounding matrix in dark-field TEM image taken along a noncentrosymmetric zone axis under
multiple beam condition. No apparent complementary contrasts were observed from dark-field TEM images
with g = 0002 and g =

inversion domain as well as the uniform polarity of the Zn1-xMgxO films.

electron beam operating at 200 kV, as shown in Figure 5(a) (denoted as exp.). It reveals that the fringes in
(0000) disk are symmetrical because the electron beam was exactly parallel to the (0002) plane.16, 18 In
addition, a noticeable difference of contrast between the central fringes of (0002) and )2000(

diffraction
disks was visualized. In general, element with higher atomic number is cable of scattering more electrons than
that with lower atomic number under the simultaneous incident electron beam condition. The central fringe at
(0002)Zn face (constructed by Zn atoms) should give rise to higher contrast than that at )2000(

O (constructed
by O atoms). Thus, (0002)Zn and )2000(

O can be easily distinguished by the central fringes from bright and
dark in the CBED disks, respectively. From aforementioned XRD and TEM consequences, Mg atoms are
successfully incorporated within the {0001} ZnO films without changing its wurtzite structure. Therefore, a
simulated CBED pattern of ZnO along ]0011[

zone axis (denoted as sim. in Figure 5(a)) is employed for
comparison.38 The thickness of TEM specimen used for CBED simulation is 42 nm. The CBED patterns in
Figure 5(a) reveal that experimental Zn0.856Mg0.144O one exhibits the same fringes as the simulated one. The
specific fringes in (0002)Zn and )2000(

O disks as well as the resemblance between experimental and
simulated CBED patterns both confirm that the growth direction of Zn1-xMgxO films was exactly along
26
In addition, the reducing pit size corresponding to the enhancement of Mg concentration in the Zn1-xMgxO
films is visualized. These hexagonal pits are aligned throughout the sample with their )0110(

plane parallel
to each other. It confirms that the Zn1-xMgxO films were grown epitaxially rather than preferentially along the
out-of-plane [0001]ZnMgO direction on (001) LGO substrates. Furthermore, etching process is claimed to start
from defect sites in the ZnO films.27-29 The density of hexagonal pits increases with the Mg content in the film,
as shown in Figures 6 (d), (f), (h). It suggests the successful doping of Mg atoms into the ZnO epitaxial films
and the formation of substitutional defects of Mg atoms in the ZnO films.
Figure 7 reveals the normalized room-temperature CL spectra of the (0001) Zn1-xMgxO films grown on (001)
LGO substrates. Strong and sharp UV emissions attributed to the near-band-edge emission of the wide
bandgap Zn1-xMgxO (337 to 377 nm) are observed. In addition to the UV emissions, much broader visible
green-band emissions also present in the CL spectra. The green-band emission is usually assigned to be
attributed to the existence of the deep-level recombination centers related to crystal defects.41 An obvious blue
shift of the near-band-edge emission without apparent change of FWHM is ascribed to the enhancement of
Mg doping concentrations in the films. Moreover, as shown in the inset of Figure 7, the near-band-edge
emission energies of these Zn1-xMgxO films measured at room temperature increase monotonically with the
Mg concentrations, demonstrating the potential bandgap engineering of wurtzite ZnO by tailoring the Mg
contents.
Conclusion
Epitaxial Zn-terminated Zn1-xMgxO films have been successfully grown on small lattice-mismatched (001)
LGO substrates by MOCVD method. XPS analyses confirm the Mg concentration in the films is tunable from

ABSTRACT: γ-LiAlO2 (100) and sapphire (101j0) substrates have been employed to grow nonpolar (101j0) Zn1-xMgxO films using
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Zn1-xMgxO films with various Mg contents (0 e x e 0.113) are obtained by adjusting the
partial pressure of the Mg metalorganic precursor in gas phase. Mg atoms incorporate within the films by means of substituting Zn.
No segregated phase such as MgO or metal Mg is observed throughout the Zn1-xMgxO films. Structural characterization of the films
indicates that γ-LiAlO2 (100) is a superior substrate to sapphire (101j0) for the growth of the nonpolar (101j0) Zn1-xMgxO films. The
epitaxial (101j0) Zn1-xMgxO films are successfully grown on the γ-LiAlO2 substrates with the epitaxial relationship of [101j0]ZMO |
[100]LAO and [12j10]ZMO | [001]LAO. On the other hand, the Zn1-xMgxO films with both (101j0) and (101j3) orientations are obtained
on sapphire substrates although Zn1-xMgxO (101j0) becomes dominant with increasing Mg content. In addition, room-temperature
cathodoluminescence spectra of the epitaxial (101j0) Zn1-xMgxO films show an obvious blue shift of the near-band-edge emission
with increasing Mg content, demonstrating bandgap engineering in the epitaxial nonpolar (101j0) Zn1-xMgxO films on the γ-LiAlO2
substrates.
Introduction
Owing to its wide band gap (3.37 eV) and large exciton
binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature, ZnO is believed
to be a potential material for blue and UV optoelectronic
applications.1-3 ZnO exhibits a wurtzite structure and grows
preferentially along the [0001] direction. Therefore, c-plane ZnO
films are conventionally obtained on most substrates. However,
devices based on (0001)-oriented wurtzite GaN are known to
present spontaneous and piezoelectric electrostatic fields. The
existence of the internal electric field spatially separates electrons
and holes in the active layers, resulting in a quantum-confined
stark effect (QCSE) that not only causes a reduction of the
device quantum efficiency but also leads to an undesirable red
shift in the emission spectra. It has been demonstrated that the
electrostatic field of the GaN is absent in the directions
orthogonal to the [0001] polar axis.4 Research concerning the
internal electric field in the ZnO/Zn1-xMgxO quantum wells has
attracted much attention as well due to the promising photonic
properties of ZnO crystal. Nevertheless, only few papers
reported the growth of the nonpolar ZnO layers, such as (112j0)
(a-plane)5-7 or (101j0) (m-plane),8-10 which is ascribed to the
limitation of the available lattice-matched substrates.
Lattice match between the films and substrates is one of the
crucial criterions for epitaxial growth. Among all of the possible
substrates, γ-LiAlO2 (100)10 and sapphire (101j0)11,12 (denoted
as LAO and m-sapphire hereafter) have been employed to
fabricate m-plane ZnO films. In the case of m-sapphire substrate,
the lattice constant along the c-axis sapphire is 12.991 Å, which
is nearly four times the lattice constant along the a-axis ZnO,
3.242 Å. The lattice mismatch is only -0.18%. Nevertheless,
the other in-plane alignment between m-plane ZnO films and
m-sapphire, [0001]ZnO | [112j0]sapphire, cZnO (5.194 Å) and asapphire
(4.758 Å), possesses a larger lattice mismatch of 8.39%.
Moriyama et al. reported on ZnO films grown on m-sapphire
using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy.11 They demonstrated
that both ZnO (101j0) and (011j3) orientations were observed
on the m-sapphire at temperatures lower than 700 °C. The
m-plane ZnO became dominant only when the growth temper-
ature was increased to 800 °C.11 On the other hand, Chou et al.
have demonstrated the growth of the nonpolar m-plane ZnO
epitaxial film on the LAO single crystal substrate via thermal
chemical vapor deposition.10 LAO is considered to be a
promising substrate for m-plane ZnO growth since the LAO
(100) plane exhibits a relatively small lattice mismatch to
m-plane ZnO, namely, [0001]ZnO | [010]LAO with ∼0.52% and
[112j0]ZnO | [001]LAO with ∼3.18%. Apart from the small lattice
mismatch, other advantages, such as low melting point (1750
°C), easy processing due to its low hardness, and ability to be
removed by chemical etching after ZnO growth,13 all make LAO
an appropriate substrate for the fabrication of the m-plane ZnO
films.
Recently, incorporation of Mg into ZnO has been extensively
investigated to widen the bandgap of the ZnO based materials
by forming a Zn1-xMgxO alloy without changing its wurtzite
structure.14-21 Among this research, very few papers demon-
strated the growth of the nonpolar a-plane19-21 and m-plane22
Zn1-xMgxO. To the best of our knowledge, there is no paper
reporting the formation of the nonpolar (101j0) epitaxial
Zn1-xMgxO films. Due to the aforementioned importance of the
nonpolar ZnO/Zn1-xMgxO quantum wells, in this present work,
the growth of the nonpolar m-plane Zn1-xMgxO films was
examined using both m-sapphire and LAO substrates by a simple
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method.
Structural characterization of the films indicates that LAO is a
superior substrate to m-sapphire for the growth of the m-plane
Zn1-xMgxO films. The epitaxial m-plane Zn1-xMgxO films are
successfully grown on the LAO substrates in the absence of
the buffer layer. A blue shift of the near-band-edge emission
with increasing Mg content is observed, demonstrating bandgap

After calibration by the adventitious C 1s peak at 285.2 eV,23
the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Mg 2p on the surface of
the Zn1-xMgxO film are centered at 1021.9 and 49.5 eV,
respectively. The depth-profile analyses of the Zn 2p3/2 and Mg
2p scans of the Zn1-xMgxO films were also performed to
examine the uniformities of the composition throughout the film.
As shown in Figures 1(c) and 1(d), the center positions of the
calibrated Zn 2p3/2 and Mg 2p peaks at different depths are
identical, at 1021.9 and 49.5 eV, respectively, indicating the
superior chemical-state uniformity throughout the Zn1-xMgxO
films. In addition, Mg contents estimated from the peak areas
of Mg 2p to Zn 2p3/223 at layers from film surface to the interface
with LAO substrate, as shown in Figure 1(e), are almost the
same with an average of x ) 0.113. This result indicates that
the Mg content is quite uniform throughout the Zn1-xMgxO film.
In the present work, the x values of the Zn1-xMgxO films are
determined by the average of the x values obtained from depth-
profile XPS measurements. It reveals that the Mg contents (x)
of the Zn1-xMgxO films are tunable from 0 to 0.113 by adjusting
the partial pressures of the Mg sources in gas phase.
SEM images of the Zn1-xMgxO grown on the m-sapphire and
LAO substrates are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. As
shown in Figure 2(a), nanorods tilted at an angle about 30° to
the normal of the m-sapphire substrate are obtained when the
Mg source is absent. It has been reported that single crystal-
line ZnO nanowires could be grown vertically on the a-plane
sapphire by taking advantage of the good epitaxial interface
between the c-plane of ZnO and the a-plane of sapphire.24 Since
the angle between the m-plane and a-plane of sapphire is 30°,
as shown in Figure 2(b), it is suggested that the growth direction
of the ZnO nanorods shown in Figure 2(a) is still along the
c-axis. With an increase of the Mg content, Figures 2(c)-(e)
show that the density of the nanorods decreases on the
m-sapphire substrates. The rectangle-like blocks dominate the
Zn1-xMgxO film with x ) 0.113, however, the formation of a
smooth Zn1-xMgxO film on the m-sapphire substrate is not
achieved in the present work. Moreover, although the m-sapphire
has been demonstrated to be a promising substrate for the
formation of the m-plane ZnO at 800 °C,11 in the present work,
Zn1-xMgxO film with obvious hexagons was obtained at this
temperature as shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Informa-
tion.
In contrast to the m-sapphire substrates, the epitaxial m-plane
ZnO films have been grown on the LAO substrates at a
temperature of 650 °C.10 In the case of Mg addition, the
morphology of the Zn1-xMgxO films deposited on the LAO
substrates is similar to that of the m-plane ZnO films. As shown
in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), typical SEM micrographs of the
Zn1-xMgxO films with low and high magnifications, Zn1-xMgxO
blocks were arranged continuously side by side to each other.
The periodical islands shown in Figure 3(a) are formed
following the topography of the LAO substrates (Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information). Figure 3 (c) shows a typical cross-
section image of the Zn1-xMgxO films grown on the LAO
substrates for 1 h. The film thickness is estimated to be about
180 nm. When prolonging the deposition time to 6 h, the
Zn1-xMgxO blocks tend to merge together and form a continuous
film as shown in Figures 3 (d) and 3(e). The thickness of the
Zn1-xMgxO films grown on the LAO substrates for 6 h increases
to∼850 nm as indicated in Figure 3(f). Although the Zn1-xMgxO
blocks grow along the topography of the LAO substrates at the
beginning, continuous Zn1-xMgxO films are potentially able to
be obtained when the film is thicker than 850 nm.
Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of the Zn1-xMgxO grown
on the m-sapphire and LAO substrates with various Mg
concentrations. The XRD patterns of those grown on the
m-sapphire substrates shown in Figure 4(a) are normalized by
the intensity of the m-sapphire (101j0) diffraction peak. In
addition to the sapphire (101j0) peak, the ZnO (101j0) and (101j3)

The Zn1-xMgxO films grown on the LAO substrates show
superior m-plane characteristics compared to those on m-
sapphire substrates. Consequently, it is worth addressing that
LAO is a promising substrate for the growth of the nonpolar
m-plane ZnO and Zn1-xMgxO films.
Further structure characterization of the nonpolar Zn1-xMgxO
(ZMO) films grown on the LAO substrate was performed using
TEM. Figure 5(a) shows a cross-sectional bright-field image of
the nonpolar Zn0.932Mg0.068O film on the LAO (100) substrate.
The image was taken near the [0001]ZMO zone axis with g )
12j10. A clear-cut interface between the nonpolar Zn0.932Mg0.068O
film and LAO substrate is observed due to the high contrast.
The thickness of the Zn0.932Mg0.068O film measured here is about
185 nm, which is close to that shown in Figure 3(c). The high-
resolution (HR) TEM micrograph of the interfacial region of
the Zn1-xMgxO film and LAO substrate is shown in Figure 5(b).
The incident beam is parallel to [0001]ZMO and [010]LAO. The
HRTEM image demonstrates an apparent interface between the
Zn1-xMgxO film and LAO substrate. The lattice spacing of
the planes perpendicular to the substrate is estimated to be 0.28
nm. It matches well with the literature value for (101j0) planes
in wurtzite ZnO structure, confirming that the Zn1-xMgxO film
grows along the [101j0] direction. Figure 5(c) shows the
corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
taken from the Zn1-xMgxO film portion. Only sharp and clear
diffraction spots that belong to ZnO {101j0} are observed. No
other ambiguous diffraction spot appearing provides that no Mg
or MgO clusters forms in the Zn1-xMgxO films. This conse-
quence is consistent with aforementioned XRD results. SAED
was also taken from the interface region between the Zn1-xMgxO
film and LAO substrates, as shown in Figure 5(d). Extra
diffraction spots in addition to those contributed from the γ-LAO
phase and the wurtzite ZMO phase are observed in Figure 5(d).
These spots very possibly result from R-LAO phase transformed
from the γ-phase on irradiation of high energy electron beam.26
The distorted lattice image of LAO shown in Figure 5(b) also
gives evidence of the irradiation-induced transformation. Ac-
cording to Figure 5(d), the epitaxial relationship between
Zn1-xMgxO and LAO is determined as [101j0]ZMO | [100]LAO
and [12j10]ZMO | [001]LAO. Both the HRTEM image and
corresponding SAED reveal the successful formation of the
epitaxial Zn1-xMgxO (101j0) films on LAO substrates.
Figure 6 exhibits the room-temperature CL spectra of the
m-plane Zn1-xMgxO films grown on LAO substrates. The CL
spectrum of the LAO substrate is also shown in this figure. The
CL spectra have been normalized for comparison. A strong UV
emission ascribed to the near-band-edge emission of the wide
bandgap Zn1-xMgxO is observed in the CL spectra. In addition
to the strong UV emission, another UV emission (around
300-350 nm) and a visible emission (475-525 nm) are also
present in the spectra of the Zn1-xMgxO film. The former is
attributed to the CL emission of the LAO substrate, and the
latter might be caused by the oxygen vacancies in the
Zn1-xMgxO films. Strong UV emission peaks at 382, 377, 367,
362, 359, 357, and 352 nm are shown in the CL spectra of the
Zn1-xMgxO films with x ) 0, 0.012, 0.040, 0.068, 0.095, 0.104
and 0.113, respectively. An obvious blue shift of the near-band-
edge emission without significant change of FWHM is observed
with increasing Mg content in the films. This result indicates
that the near-band-edge emission energies of the Zn1-xMgxO
films measured at room temperature increase monotonically with
the Mg contents as shown in the inset of Figure 6.
Conclusion
MOCVD growth of the nonpolar (101j0) Zn1-xMgxO films
has been examined on the LAO (100) and m-sapphire substrates
in the present work. XPS analyses reveal that the Zn1-xMgxO
films possess a good uniformity of composition. The Mg
contents of the Zn1-xMgxO films are tunable from 0 to 0.113
by adjusting the partial pressures of the Mg sources in the gas
phase. The Zn1-xMgxO (101j0) and (101j3) diffraction peaks are
observed in the XRD patterns of the films grown on m-sapphire
substrates although the intensity ratio of the (101j0) and (101j3)
peaks gradually increases with the increment of Mg contents.
On the other hand, only the diffraction peaks of Zn1-xMgxO
(101j0) and LAO (100) appear in the XRD patterns of the
Zn1-xMgxO films grown on the LAO substrates. No Mg metal
or MgO exists throughout the Zn1-xMgxO films. TEM analyses
demonstrate the successful formation of the epitaxial Zn1-xMgxO

an apparent interface between the Zn1-xMgxO film and LAO
