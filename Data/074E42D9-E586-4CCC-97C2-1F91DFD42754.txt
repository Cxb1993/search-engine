2numbers. Fuzzy regression is suitable for problems in which human experts rely on
subjective judgment or past experience. Followed by Tanaka et al. [5], a variety of
developments of fuzzy regression techniques and applications have been used. Chang
[6] developed a fuzzy linear regression model that is capable of analyzing a mixture
of crisp data and fuzzy data.
Bridge girder is one of the most important components that support loadings of
vehicles and decks. The duration after the previous maintenance is a key factor
affecting bridge girder conditions. Therefore, this paper employs Chang’s model to
develop the relationship between bridge girder condition and the duration after the
previous maintenance.
2. Methodology
In the DERU evaluation approach, the condition of bridge component i can be
estimated by using the condition index ( iIc ) scoring between 0 and 100, which is
given by
n
Ic
Ic
n
j
ij
i

 1 , (1)
where n is the number of the total components; Icij is a condition index for the j part
of component i.
Although the above equation can be used to estimate the deterioration condition of
each bridge element in terms of condition index; however, it is difficult for bridge
inspectors to express their opinion of the strength of associated bridge conditions by
assigning exact numbers between 1 and 4 to further derive the condition index. To
overcome the above problems, five linguistic terms as shown in Fig. 1 are defined and
used in this study.
In Chang’s model, each fuzzy observed data point can be expressed as iY
~ = (Yi,
ei,,L, ei,,R), where Yi is the fuzzy center, where i = 1, 2,…n, and n is the sample size;
ei,,L and ei,,R is the fuzzy width on the left and the fuzzy width on the right of observed
iY
~ at membership  level, respectively.
LY ,ˆ
 and
RY ,ˆ
 are the left bound and
right bound of the estimated value iˆY at membership level. Concerning one crisp
independent variable (X) and one fuzzy dependent variable iˆY , the linear regression
can be expressed as

In the above equations, matrix βˆ~ contains the least squares estimates of the
coefficients of k ,...,1,0 of the fuzzy linear model. Using the Y

By matrix operations, the estimated regression coefficients can be derived as

The fuzzy coefficient of determination (HR)2 is used to explain the proportion of

3. Case study and analysis
Ten concrete girders’inspection data obtained from the National Sun Yat-Sen
Freeway in Taiwan are used as shown in Table 1. It can be found in Table 1 that girder
condition is regarded as fuzzy dependent variable ( Y). The corresponding crisp
predictor variable is duration after the previous maintenance or rehabilitation (X).
Since the inspection data are mixed numerical and fuzzy values, an ordinary
regression model is incapable of dealing with this problem. The Chang’s fuzzy
regression model is applied here.

4. Conclusions
Data on existing bridge conditions derived from the bridge inspector’s
assessments are subjective and non-crisp in nature, therefore ordinary regression
analysis cannot analyze such imprecise data. This paper presents a matrix-driven
fuzzy linear regression model to estimate bridge girder conditions. A case study based
on historical inspection data from bridge girders in Taiwan was analyzed. The result
indicates that the proposed approach is capable of dealing with fuzzy data and a
mixture of crisp data and fuzzy data, which conventional regression analysis is
incapable of analyzing. The result also shows that the model has potential for use with
similar types of prediction problems.
