In the inviscid stability theory of 
compressible boundary layers the neutral mode 
of disturbances propagating with the phase 
speed of  was classified  based on the free 
stream Mach number  by Less & Lin [
c
∞M 8] 
as supersonic when , sonic when 
, and subsonic when 
∞−< Mc /11
∞±= Mc /11 <<− ∞ cM/11  
. Using the well known relative Mach 
number 
∞+ M/11
M  which is function of mean stream 
velocity , density U ρ  and  defined as ∞M
222 )( cUMM −= ∞ρ .        (1) 
Then, 12 <M , 12 =M and 12 >M correspond 
respectively to the relative subsonic, sonic and 
supersonic region. In the relative subsonic 
region the disturbance waves are regarded as 
the vorticity modes; those in the relative 
supersonic region are called the acoustic modes. 
If the relative Mach number is less than unity 
everywhere in the boundary layers, the stability 
theory is similar to that for incompressible flow, 
however, if there is a relative supersonic region 
12 >M  within the boundary layer, the inviscid 
stability theory admits multiplicity of solutions. 
 In a compressible boundary layer the sonic 
point is defined as the point  where the 
velocity of the mean flow  is equal to the 
phase speed of the sonic wave. i.e., 
ty
)(yU
∞−== MyUc t /11)(0 ,        (2) 
thus this thin region centered at  is called 
the transition layer.

 A second point of interest that is unique to 
compressible boundary layers is the generalized 
inflection point which is defined as the point

The generalized inflection point mode is the 
disturbance with the phase speed that has the 
value of the mean flow velocity at this point, i.e. 
, and the thin region centered at this 
point is regarded as the critical layer. It follows 
from the definition that at the generalized 
inflection point the relative Mach number is 
vanished.

compressible boundary layer: relative 
subsonic region (I), relative sonic region 
(II) and relative supersonic region (III). 
 
Fig.1 shows schematically the location of 
various layers within a compressible boundary 
layer. It was shown by Less & Lin [8] that the 
necessary and sufficient condition for the 
existence of generalized inflection point modes 
is that  within the boundary layer. As 
 increases the generalized inflection point 
occurs first at the wall, then the sonic point at 
ts yy >
∞M
2.2=∞M , and as  moves outward to 
the edge of the boundary layer (Mack [
∞→∞M
ey 9]). 
Therefore, for , the boundary layer 
can be divided into a relative subsonic, sonic 
and supersonic regions. 
2.2>∞M
 Because of the complexity of the problem 
much of our current understanding is based on 
the definitive numerical study of Mack [9]. In 
recent years much effort has been devoted to 
theoretical analyses (see Smith & Brown [12], 
Reshotko [11], Cowley & Hall [5], Blackaby, 
Cowley & Hall [2], Grubin & Trigub [6, 7], 
Bower & Liu [3]). The main difficulty is due to 
the lack of the analytical descriptions of the 
mean flow for various gases and different 
forms of viscosity laws. Thus, most of the 
results are based on asymptotic methods such 
as the triple deck theory or the WKB theory. 
Since the generalized inflection point depends 
on the relative Mach number distribution which 
in turn depends on the mean flow velocity 
distribution and the various thermodynamical 
properties of the gas together with the choice of 
the viscosity law, these results are therefore

In terms of ζ  the relative Mach number now 
becomes

The transition point is now located at 0=ξ  
which is also a turning point, the generalized 
inflection point is located at 
1−= σξs ,         (23) 
and the wall, denoted by wξ , is located at 
))Y(1()6/Y( 2/32/3 −− −−=wξ .         (24) 
For the problem considered here, )(ξQ  
has a simple zero at 0=ξ  and it follows from 
Eq.(14) 
0)( >ξQ  and 1)(2 <ξM  for 0>ξ , 
0)( <ξQ and 1)(2 >ξM  for 0<ξ . 
Therefore, we can divide ξ  axis into three 
regions:  
(I) subsonic region: 0>ξ , thus 1)(2 <ξM . 
(II) turning point region: 1<<ξ , thus 
1)(2 ≈ξM . 
(III) supersonic region: 0<ξ , thus 1)(2 >ξM . 
Since 0)( <ξQ  in the supersonic region, the 
solutions in this region are expected to be 
propagating waves. In subsonic region 0)( >ξQ , 
exponentially decaying solutions are to be 
expected. In the turning point region 1)(2 ≈ξM , 
the function of )(ξQ  can be approximated by 
3/2σξ , where σ  is a positive constant. Since 
, it is assumed to be small. Thus the 
approximate solutions for each of the three 
regions can be obtained by applying the 
well-known WKB method that they are found 
to be (Bender & Orszag [

Substitute Eq.(48) into Eq.(19) the vorticity

4.3 The ratio of the acoustic modes and 
vorticity mode 
The acoustic modes Eq.(43) and vorticity 
mode Eq.(49) can be expressed as a function of 
a single parameter Y explicitly. In addition, the 
ratio of these two modes can be obtained as

The intersection of these two modes,

V. Local Perturbation on Intersection 
of vorticity and acoustic modes 
 
As two loci of eigenvalues 
)Y(ˆˆ αα = approach each other, they often cross 
or abruptly diverge, thus leads to the well 
known phenomena of fluttering or curve 
veering respectively (see Cheng and Perkins [4], 
Pierre [10]). In this section, the phenomena of 
curve veering and fluttering can be analyzed by 
applying a small perturbation to the 
intersections  of the two modes as 
shown in Table 1. Multiplying Eq.(37) by 
)ˆ,Y( ∗∗ α

trajectories correspond to curve veering. 
Substitute Eq.(72) into Eq.(69) we obtain

Thus, the distance that separates these two

As a comparison, the acoustic modes Eq. (43) 
and the vorticity mode Eq. (49) are plotted in 
dashed curves and together with the solutions 
of Eq.(57) shown as solid curves in Fig. 2. Fig. 
4 shows the detail of the veering for the first 
four intersections given in Table 1. When a 
disturbance with acoustic mode is triggered, 
this disturbance will first propagate as an 
acoustic mode then as a vorticity mode after the 
interaction of the two modes as Y increases. 
Thus, the veering of the trajectories from the 
intersection provides a mechanism for the 
exchange of the two modes. In this sense, the 
vorticity mode provides a bridge for acoustic 
mode to evolve to a higher order mode. 
 
VI. Application to physical flows 
 
To start off, the mean flow velocity, density can 
be determined by numerically inverse 
integrating the compressible boundary layer 
equations with the aid of the shooting method. 
The medium is taken to be air which is 
assumed to be an ideal gas with 4.1=γ . The 
viscosity is assumed to obey the Sutherland’s 
law

5. Conclusions 
In the current study, because of the simple 
form of the quadratic relative Mach number 
model, the governing equation of inviscid 
disturbance within a compressible boundary 
layer can be reduced to depend on the profiles 
of the generalized inflection point and the 
curvature of the relative Mach number at this 
point for each free stream Mach number. Thus, 
the method developed in this paper can be 
applied to estimate the more complex problems 
as long as there is a single turning point and a 
relative supersonic region in the boundary 
layer. 
 We have shown that by using this simple 
quadratic relative Mach number model the 
vorticity and acoustic modes can be expressed 
in close forms with the aid of the WKB method. 
They are found to be functions of a new 
parameter Y, which is the product of the 
curvature of the relative Mach number profile 
at the generalized inflection point and the 
corresponding profile. The near-linking area of 
these two modes can then be analyzed by 
introducing a small parameter to the 
intersection of these two modes. It is shown 
that any small perturbation will cause the two 
modes to veer off thus provides a mechanism 
for the acoustic to evolve to higher modes.  
 
VII. 計畫成果自評 
 
The goal of this project has been realized 
successfully. It can be shown that the 
theoretical approach for estimating the acoustic 
modes and vorticity mode of inviscid stability 
theory in a hypersonic boundary layer is easily 
done by the closed form equations of these two 
modes. With the aid of this approach, the more 
precise study on the hypersonic boundary will 
cost down the computing time for numerical 
computation.  
The part of the analytical analysis has been 
submitted to 2006 AASRC/CCAS Joint 
Conference. The more complete version which 
includes the numerical study is under rewriting 
for submitting the journal paper in the near 
future.
