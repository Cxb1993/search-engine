nodes in RWP reach the destination, they will select a point in 
the area for the next destination. Although the probability of 
each point being picked up is equal, the probability of the 
moving direction where the point falls in depends on the nodal 
current position. In Figure1, there is a node located at the center 
(X1, Y1) within a square with corners, (0, 0), (Xmax, Ymax), (Xmax, 
0), and (0, Ymax). Assume that the next destination is (X2, Y2), 
and (X2, Y2) can be presented with a distance d and an angle θ as 
the following:

It is noted that if (X1, Y1) is (Xmax/2, Ymax/2), the probability 
of the destination falling in each quadrant is the same, which is 
1/4. If the nodal current position is close to the edge, for 
example: (X2, Y2) in Figure1, the probability of the next 
destination within the first quadrant will be higher than the other 
three ones. Thus the node will tend to move towards the center 
area with a higher probability, especially when the node is away 
of the center. 
 
Figure 1.   
Another severe problem in RWP is the speed decaying 
during the simulation. Since the next speed and destination are 
picked independently, the travel time (Time = Distance / Speed) 
is fixed once the speed and the destination, or distance, are 
selected. By observing the residential time of each speed, rather 
than occurring times, during the simulation, we plot the ratio of 
duration for each speed, (0, 20], in Figure2.

We can easily observe that the speed from 0 to 1 occupies 
over 50% of the simulation time (10hours * 100nodes). 
Theoretically, if the speed distribution is uniform within (0,20], 
the duration ratio of each speed interval should be identical. It 
sometimes happens in RWP that lower speed is paired with the 
longer distance and higher speed paired with the shorter distance. 
Even if the distance is constant, the nodes with lower speed will 
maintain its speed for longer time than the ones with higher 
speed. Therefore the lower speed will dominate the average 
speed in the long run. There exist some more detailed analyses 
in [4][6][7][8]. 
To solve the problems in RWP, we first propose the Ripple 
Mobility Model (RMM) as follows. To treat each direction 
fairly in determining the destination, we generate a mechanism 
similar to Random Direction Mobility Model. On determining 
the next destination position, a moving node first chooses a 
random speed S uniformly from [Smin, Smax]. The next 
destination position is then chosen randomly within the disc 
centered at the current nodal position with radius of D, where D 
is a configurable parameter in simulation. This will generate a 
nodal moving trajectory with random moving direction that 
does not favor passing the middle area. If the node is close to the 
boundary, the destination may fall off the boundary. If the node 
reaches the boundary, it will bounce off at the boundary 
according to the rule that incidence angle is equal to the 
reflection angle. The most significant difference between 
Random Direction Mobility Model and our proposed 
mechanism is that the nodes in Random Direction Mobility 
Model will move straight with the same direction and speed 
until they reach the boundary. In addition, to eliminate the 
decaying average speed and also to achieve different average 
speed in the same upper and lower speed limits, Ripple Mobility 
Model is extended with the concept of Lower Speed for Shorter 
Distance (LSSD). In LSSD extension, if nodes choose a speed 
lower than Slower, the destination has to be chosen within limited 
distance, Dshorter. In this way, by selecting different Slower and 
Dshorter within the same speed limits, flexible simulation 
scenarios can be generated. The procedure of Ripple Mobility 
Model is illustrated in Figure 3 and further described as the 
following: 
• Set the following  parameters: Slower, Dradius, Dshorter, Smin, 
Smax, with Smin≦Slower≦Smax,  Dshorter≦Dradius 
• Choose a random speed S within [Smin, Smax]. If S≦
Slower, set D = Dshorter. Otherwise, set D = Dradius. The 
next destination position (x, y) is then chosen randomly

The nodal distribution with smaller UI presents the more 
uniform nodal positions. However, the UI index itself is not 
able to reveal if the shape of nodal spatial distribution is like 
the bell-shaped one we may observe within RWP. Thus we 
will show UI in each figure to provide numerical information 
in addition to the graphic presentation. 
The nodal spatial distributions of different mobility 
scenarios are presented in Figures 6-8. In Figure 6, it does 
show the spatial characteristic of RWP. The nodes tend to 
move across the center of the moving area and its UI value is 
about 0.635. In RWP, the highest and lowest nodal appearance 
times are 96605 and 5214.

Figure 7 and Figure 8 are the node spatial distributions of

Figure 6 and Figure 7( or Figure 8), we can easily find that the 
border effect presented in RWP is diminished in RMM. The UI 
value of RMM is far lower than RWP and it indicates that RMM 
has achieved more uniform nodal spatial distribution in the 
simulation. We also provide some UI value of different RMM 
scenarios in Table 1.

C. RMM Evaluation 
In this section, we will evaluate the different parameters in 
RMM to highlight some considerations for RMM deployment. 
In RMM, the lower speed parameter, s, and shorter distance 
parameter, d, play important roles to generate different average 
speed. The appropriate selections of s and d should be employed 
to generate useful mobility patterns for simulation. Figure 4 and 
Figure 5 present two kinds of pairs of s and d selection. Figure 4 
is simulated with fixed s and variable d while Figure 5 is 
simulated with variable s and fixed d. We have mentioned that 
Figure 4 provides more diversity speed scenarios than Figure 5.

Figure 9.  Node Spatial Distribution of RMM(0,0) Initial Central Position 
Secondly, we evaluate the effects of initial nodal positions 
on RMM. We initially place 100 nodes at the center of the 
moving area while keeping other parameters unchanged. The 
simulation results for nodal spatial distributions are sketched in 
Figure 9 and Figure 10. Compared to Figure 7 and Figure 8, we 
observe that initial nodal position will not affect the properties 
of RMM. Furthermore, the different initial nodal position still 
generates the identical speed pattern while the initial nodal 
position will change that of the RWP.

Abstract 
 
Most wireless protocols and algorithms proposed in 
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) are evaluated and 
compared by using simulations. The impacts of various 
simulation parameters are noticeable. However, the 
effects of the mobility model do not attract many 
attentions until recently. The Random Waypoint (RWP) 
mobility model, due to its simplicity, is one of the most 
often deployed mobility models in simulations. But it 
implicitly introduces many defects such as average 
speed decaying and un-uniform node distribution. In 
this paper, we propose a novel mobility model, 
General Ripple Mobility Model (GRMM), to reduce 
the above mentioned problems in RWP. Furthermore, 
GRMM can provide another great feature, Diverse 
Average Speed (DAS), to generate different average 
speed mobility patterns easily within the same speed 
range. Simulation results have shown that GRMM can 
simultaneously achieve uniform node distribution and 
diverse average speed. 
 
1. Introduction 
Creating a sound simulation environment is an 
important procedure for researches in Mobile Ad Hoc 
Networks (MANET). It is difficult and time-
consuming to construct a real MANET environment 
for evaluating proposed protocols. Given different 
simulation parameters, we can evaluate and compare 
the performance of different proposed protocols. 
A mobility model plays an important role in 
MANET simulation [1]. It will generate different node 
mobility patterns and different topology. Random 
Waypoint (RWP) [2] is the most often deployed 
mobility model in many researches. RWP is well-
known for its simplicity and easy implementation. 
Over the past few years, the implicit properties of 
RWP are inspected in several reports. In summary, 
there are two major problems of RWP: decaying 
average speed and border effects. If RWP is employed 
as the main mobility model in simulations, unexpected 
conditions will be observed.  
Some mobility models are proposed for certain 
specified situations. Since the targeted scenario is clear, 
we can design the mobility models fitting to the 
requirement. However, if the proposed protocols are 
not designed for any special environment, a general 
mobility model for evaluation is thus necessary. 
Besides uniform node distribution, achieving different 
average speed under the same speed range is one of the 
properties which are neglected in most mobility 
models. The concept of Diverse Average Speed (DAS) 
for the same speed range is not available in most 
proposed mobility models. Instead, they assign 
different speed range to obtain different average speed.  
In this paper, we propose a mobility model, General 
Ripple Mobility Model (GRMM), which is the general 
version of our previous work [14]. It maintains the 
simple structure as RWP, provides solutions for the 
problems incurred in RWP, and generates the property 
of Diverse Average Speed. In the following section, 
we review the RWP mobility model. The GRMM is 
described in details in the third section. Finally, we 
present the simulation results and conclusions. 
 
2. The RWP mobility Model 
The workflow of RWP is briefly described here: A 
node randomly picks up a moving speed (within the 
speed range) and a destination coordinate within the 
moving area. It then moves with the selected speed 
constantly until it reaches the selected destination 
coordinate. The node then selects another speed and a 
new destination coordinate again and repeats the 
procedures. 
Over the past few years, some implicit properties of 
RWP are discovered. One of them is the spatial 
distribution [3-8]. Because the destinations are picked 
randomly in the moving area, we may expect that the 
node spatial distribution is also uniformly distributed at 
any time we observe. However, the node spatial

if the distance from Node A to Node B is smaller 
than or equal to D, there exists a link between 
Node A and Node B. At each sampling time, we 
average the number of links. If the node 
distribution is dense, the number of links will be 
larger. 
z Average Connection Time: Similar to Average 
Number of Links, we collect the duration time of 
links once they exist. If the average duration of 
links is smaller, we can assume that the network 
topology changes more frequently.  
z Spatial Distribution: We partition the rectangle 
area X*Y into the sections of 100m*100m. 
During sampling, we calculate and accumulate 
how many nodes are located within each section. 
The numbers of network nodes within each 
section are identical in a completely uniform 
spatial distribution. 
z Spatial Entropy: Entropy is a measure of the 
randomness. The number of network nodes 
within each section is obtained from Spatial 
Distribution. We divide the number of each 
section by the sum then we have a probability of 
a node located in each section. We compare the 
entropy of different scenarios to completely 
uniform spatial distribution, in which the 
probabilities of sections are the same.

average speeds obtained by selecting different λ spread 
from 6.38m/s to 12.21m/s. GRMM provides different 
average speed scenarios within the same speed 
limitation, [1,20].

Average connection time, shown in Figure 4, can

environment. GRMM generates scenarios with 
different average speeds and they also present different 
changing topology. Nodes with lower (higher) average 
speed can maintain longer (shorter) duration of links 
with neighboring nodes. Performance of routing 
protocols can be affected.
