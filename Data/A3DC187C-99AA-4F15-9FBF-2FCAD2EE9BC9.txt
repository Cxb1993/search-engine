Introduction  
Cement and concrete workers have the most frequent exposure to chromium because of the high 
hexavalent chromium concentration in cement products (1). The chromium exposure route was not 
only the respiratory pathway but also skin contact with the cement or concrete (2). Skin diseases, 
including irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, are the common complaints in cement workers due to 
the irritation and allergic reaction after chromium exposure (3,4). To decrease the high prevalence of 
skin disease among cement workers, many countries make an effort to decrease the chromium 
concentration in cement by adding, for example, ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) to convert the hexavalent 
chromium into trivalent chromium (5-7). In Denmark, the prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis 
significantly decreased after the initiation of FeSO4 addition to cement products, which might be 
associated with the reduction of chromium concentration in cement (8). In contrast, the prevalence of 
irritant contact dermatitis showed little change among cement workers after using FeSO4 (9), likely 
due to their daily contact with the wet cement and irritation by the strong alkaline and hygroscopic 
characteristic of the cement. To date, skin disease was still an obvious and considerable health concern 
among cement workers. 
 
On the other hand, hexavalent chromium exposure could cause an abnormal reaction of cells, such as 
chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, gene mutation, and cell death (10-12). Because it 
is highly permeant to the cell membrane, absorbed hexavalent chromium rapidly passes into a cell and 
is reduced to the trivalent chromium, which is a kinetically stable species in the cell (13). This process 
could produce several reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been demonstrated to correlate with 
genetic damage after chromium exposure (14). Hexavalent chromium has been demonstrated as a 
carcinogen associated with the risk of respiratory system cancer, particularly of the lung (13,15). 
Decreasing the level of chromium exposure and internal absorption of chromium are important health 
improvements for the population, especially for the occupational workers, exposed to chromium. 
 
Urinary chromium, generally utilized as a biomarker of exposure to hexavalent chromium, was 
recommended as the current biological exposure index (BEI) by the American Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) to evaluate the total body burden corresponding to 
time-weighted exposure levels (16). Using urinary chromium as a biomarker to estimate the internal 
dose of electroplating workers who were exposed to chromium has been proposed in several studies 
(17,18). However, to our knowledge, limited studies have been performed on the internal absorption 
estimation of chromium in cement workers, and no studies have been conducted to investigate the 
effect of skin disease on the total uptake of chromium with or without the use of FeSO4. In this study, 
we used a self-match study design to compare the urinary chromium levels before and after the use of 
FeSO4 and to investigate whether there is any interaction effect between skin disease and the 
application of FeSO4 on the internal absorption of chromium among cement workers. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Subject recruitment and personal factor measurements 
Thirty-five male cement workers were recruited in this study from the members of the Cement Labor 
Association in Taiwan for two consecutive years in 2003 without using FeSO4 and in 2004 after 
applying FeSO4. The duration of FeSO4 application was at least three months during the working 
periods among study subjects. Compared to regulatory addition of FeSO4 since 1981 in Denmark (8), 
three months of FeSO4 use can be considered a short-term application. Hand eczema, defined as the 
skin exhibiting a clear eczematous syndrome of erythema, papules, vesicles and fissures (19), was 
diagnosed by a dermatologist from the medical center in Taiwan. All study subjects were divided into 
four groups based on their hand eczema situation: hand eczema occurred in neither 2003 nor 2004 
(group 1, n=5); hand eczema occurred in 2003 but recovered in 2004 (group 2, n=8); no hand eczema 
in 2003 but hand eczema in 2004 (group 3, n=5); and hand eczema occurred in both 2003 and 2004 
 4
10.7 μg/L to 17.7 ± 2.6 μg/L, p < 0.001). Moreover, urinary chromium concentrations have decrease 
among workers with hand eczema (urinary chromium concentration decreased from 86.9 ± 11.8 μg/L 
to 17.8 ± 3.5 μg/L, p < 0.05) and without hand eczema (urinary chromium concentration decreased 
from 62.3 ± 23.1 μg/L to 17.5 ± 3.7 μg/L, p < 0.001). Furthermore, comparing the different hand 
eczema groups in 2003 and 2004, we found the urinary chromium concentrations decreased in all 
groups of cement workers, but a significant decrease was only found in workers with hand eczema in 
both 2003 and 2004 (urinary chromium concentration decreased from 89.9 ± 13.0 μg/L to 15.7 ± 3.8 
μg/L, p < 0.001) (Table 2). This indicated that the FeSO4 had a significant impact on urinary 
chromium concentration decrease in cement workers with severe and continuous skin disease.  
 
In addition, comparing the prevalence of urinary chromium concentration that exceeds BEI levels in 
2003 and 2004 (Table 3), a significant decrease in prevalence was found in 2004, indicating the FeSO4 
could reduce the risk of urinary chromium concentration that exceeds BEI levels in cement workers. 
Along with the consistent result of the urinary chromium concentration reduction, we found the 
prevalence of urinary chromium concentration that exceeds BEI levels significantly decreased from 
82.4% to 23.5% in cement workers with hand eczema during the observation periods in this study.  
 
Discussion 
The addition of FeSO4 to cement to reduce the hexavalent chromium concentrations has been a policy 
in several European countries in the past few decades (8,20). Previous studies have demonstrated that 
FeSO4 used for long periods could decrease the prevalence of allergic cement eczema in construction 
or cement workers (5,21). However, limited evidence has been postulated about the short-term period 
effects after use of FeSO4 in cement workers using a self-matched study design. Because hexavalent 
chromium is a confirmed carcinogen associated with the risk of respiratory tract cancer (11,13,22), the 
internal dose of chromium is an important health indicator for cement workers. In this study, we 
demonstrated that the FeSO4 used over a short-term period could significantly reduce the total body 
burden of chromium in cement workers, and consequently, their risk in chromium-derived diseases 
could be further reduced.  
 
A previous study has postulated that hand eczema is the major skin disease among cement workers in 
Taiwan (23), and skin disease is an important factor in the total body burden of chromium among 
cement workers (24). Skin diseases, including irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, are common 
complaints in cement and concrete workers because of strong alkalinity of and high hexavalent 
chromium concentration in cement products (1). According to the close observations in real working 
environments in this study, workers wear either cotton gloves or no skin protection equipment during 
working periods, and serious contamination was found in their hands. Hence, skin exposure could be a 
potential absorption source of chromium from direct skin contact to cement. The addition of FeSO4 to 
cement could convert the hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium. This would therefore reduce the 
possibility of further penetration of chromium into the body, since the trivalent chromium was found 
to be incapable of passing through transporters residing within the cell membrane (13), and reduce the 
amount of hexavalent chromium uptake from a skin route in workers with and without hand eczema. 
After the addition of FeSO4 in cement product, the total body burden of chromium could also be 
significantly lowered among cement workers by reducing the concentration of hexavalent chromium, 
thereby reducing the skin exposure. 
 
Comparing different hand eczema occurrences, we found higher urinary chromium concentrations in 
cement workers with hand eczema than in those without hand eczema (86.9 μg/L vs. 62.3 μg/L), 
indicating a skin disease such as hand eczema might be an important affecting factor for the total body 
burden of chromium in cement workers. After the use of FeSO4 in cement products, urinary chromium 
concentrations were significantly decreased to similar levels for cement workers both with and without

Abstract 
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is a typical endocrine disruptor. It can bind the 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor and induce expression of several genes including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, 
and CYP1B1. Estrogens themselves and their oxidative metabolites are also formed by the activities 
of various cytochrome P450 enzymes. In the present study, quantitative profiling of estrone (E1) 
and its metabolites in human Hep G2 cells treated with different amounts of 2,3,7,8-TCDD was 
reported. E1 levels decreased when the cell culture medium was treated with 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The 
levels of 2-OH E1, 4-OH E1, 2-OMe E1 and 4-OMe E1 in 2,3,7,8-TCDD-treated cell culture 
medium were higher than those in untreated cell culture medium and increased with the amount of 
2,3,7,8-TCDD added. The levels of 16α-OH E1 in 2,3,7,8-TCDD-treated cell culture medium were 
lower than that in untreated cell culture medium and decreased with the amount of 2,3,7,8-TCDD 
added. The quantitative profiling of E1 and its metabolites is considered to provide valuable 
information for the impacts of the estrogen metabolites on carcinogenesis.  
 
Introduction 
Estrogenic hormone is eliminated from the body by metabolic conversions to hormonally inactive 
or less active water-soluble metabolites that excreted in the urine or feces. In the first stage, 
transformation of estradiol (E2) into estrone (E1) by oxidation at the C17 position is a reversible 
process. The reaction normally favors the formation of E1, because E2 proceeds rapidly into E1 
while the reverse reduction of E1 to E2 occur considerably more slowly1. E1 is further metabolized 
primarily via oxidative hydroxylation followed by conjugations, including glucuronidation, 
sulfation, and O-methylation. Estrogens themselves and their oxidative metabolites are formed by 
the activities of various cytochrome P450 enzymes. These enzymes have dual functions, the 
biosynthesis and/or inactivation of physiologic regulators on the one hand and the metabolism of 
environmental chemicals on the other. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is a 
typical endocrine disruptor. It can bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce expression 
of several genes including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B12. Animal studies demonstrated that 
formation of catechol estradiol metabolites (2-OH E2 and 4-OH E2) increased in liver, kidney, and 
mammary tissues of TCDD-exposed rats3. Body burdens of 2,3,7,8-TCDD have been reported to 
associate with altered ratio of 2-OH E2 to 4-OH E24. The importance of the functional role of 
2,3,7,8-TCDD added. The levels of 2-OH E1 and 4-OH E1 in cell culture medium treated with 10 
nM 2,3,7,8-TCDD were 4.6 (22/4.7) and 1.9 (5.0/2.7) times higher than those in untreated medium, 
respectively. The levels of 16α-OH E1 in 2,3,7,8-TCDD-treated cell culture medium were lower 
than that in untreated cell culture medium and decreased with the amount of 2,3,7,8-TCDD added 
(Figure 2(a)). The toxicant 2,3,7,8-TCDD is the most potent known CYP1A1 inducer8. These 
observations, i.e. levels of 2-OH E1 and 4-OH E1 increased with the amount of 2,3,7,8-TCDD 
added and 16α-OH E1 decreased with that, are consistent with previous reports8,9. The CYP1A1 
exhibits relatively different catalytic activities for E1 hydroxylation at C2, C4, and C169. It has the 
highest activity for E1 hydroxylation at C2, and the second highest for E1 hydroxylation at C4. For 
E1 hydroxylation at C16, the CYP1A1 has a low activity and these activities correlate with the 
present observations. 
As shown in Figure 1, 2-OH E1 and 4-OH E1 were converted into metabolites, 2-OMe E1 and 
4-OMe E1, by COMT, respectively, and the levels of the metabolites in the cell culture medium 
vary with the amounts of 2,3,7,8-TCDD added. Figure 2(c) shows that the levels of 2-OMe E1 and 
4-OMe E1 in 2,3,7,8-TCDD-treated cell culture medium were higher than that in untreated cell 
culture medium and increased with the amount of 2,3,7,8-TCDD added. The levels of 2-OMe E1 
and 4-OMe E1 in cell culture medium treated with 10 nM 2,3,7,8-TCDD were 7.7 (130/17) and 36 
(16/0.45) times higher than those of untreated medium, respectively. There are at least two possible 
explanations for these observations. One possibility to be considered is that the increased levels of 
2-OH E1 and 4-OH E1 may lead to a rapid subsequent metabolism, 2-OH-E2 to 2-MeO-E2, and 
4-OH-E2 to 4-MeO-E2. Another possibility to be considered is that 2,3,7,8-TCDD treated largely 
increased the capability of COMT to metabolize 2-OH-E2 to 2-MeO-E2, and 4-OH-E2 to 
4-MeO-E2. The association between the activity of the COMT enzyme and the amount of 
2,3,7,8-TCDD added require further investigation. The level of 2-OH-3-OMe E1 was below the 
detection limit in all samples. All target analytes were below their detection limits in blank cell 
culture medium (untreated with E1 and/or 2,3,7,8-TCDD) or DMSO solution indicating no 
background interference of the target analytes.
