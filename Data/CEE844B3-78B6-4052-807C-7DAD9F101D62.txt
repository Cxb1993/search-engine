Abstract In this project, a systematic approach is proposed to deal with engineering problems 
containing circular boundaries. The mathematical tools, degenerate kernels and Fourier series, are 
utilized in the null-field integral formulation. The kernel function is expanded to the degenerate 
form and the boundary density is expressed into Fourier series. By collocating the null-field 
points on the real boundary, the singularity is novelly avoided. Five gains of well-posed model, 
singularity free, boundary-layer effect free , exponential convergence and mesh-free approach are 
achieved. By matching the boundary condition, a linear algebraic system is obtained. After 
obtaining the unknown Fourier coefficients, the solution can be obtained by using the integral 
representation. This systematic approach can be applied to solve the Helmholtz problems (second 
year). Finally, several examples are demonstrated to show the validity of present formulation. 
Keywords:  degenerate kernels, Fourier series, null-field, mesh-free, linear algebraic system

Introduction 
Engineering analysis can be formulated as mathematical models of the boundary value problems. 
In order to solve the boundary value problems, researchers and engineers have paid more 
attention on the development of boundary integral equation method (BIEM), boundary element 
method (BEM) and meshless method than domain type methods, finite element method (FEM) 
and finite difference method (FDM). Among various numerical methods, BEM is one of the most 
popular numerical approaches for solving boundary value problems. Although BEM has been 
involved as an alternative numerical method for solving engineering problems, five critical issues 
are of concern. 
(1) Treatment of singularity and hypersingularity 
It is well known that BEM are based on the use of fundamental solutions to solve partial 
differential equations. These solutions are two-point functions which are singular as the 
source and field points coincide. Most of the efforts have been focused on the singular 
boundary integral equation for problems with ordinary boundaries. In the past, several 
regularizations for hypersingularity were offered to handle it in direct and indirect ways. In 
the present approach, we employed the degenerate kernel to represent the two-point 
 3
In the second year project, we first review the recent development of the null-field integral 
equation approach [4-10] for boundary value problems (BVPs) with circular boundaries. The key 
idea is the expansion of kernel functions and boundary densities in the null-field integral 
equations. Vector decomposition technique using the adaptive observer system is required for 
nonfocal cases. Applications to the Helmholtz problems are addressed. Not only interior 
problems but also exterior cases are solved. Several examples were demonstrated to see the 
validity of the new formulation. 
Null-field integral equation approach for boundary value problems 
Suppose there are N  randomly distributed circular boundaries bounded to the domain D  and 
enclosed with the boundary, kB  ( 0, 1, 2, ,k N= " ) as shown in Fig. 1. We define

In mathematical physics, boundary value problems can be modelled by the governing equation, 
(x) 0uℑ = , x D∈ , (2) 
where ℑ  is be the Laplace operator, (x)u  is the potential function and D  is the domain of 
interest. For the 2-D Laplace problem, the integral equation for the domain point can be derived 
from the third Green’s identity, we have

where s  and x  are the source and field points, respectively, / nt u= ∂ ∂ , B  is the boundary, 
xn  denotes the outward normal vector at the field point x  and the kernel function (s, x)U , is 
the fundamental solution, and the other kernel functions, (s, x)T , (s, x)L  and (s, x)M , are 
defined in the dual boundary integral method (BIEM) [6]. 
By moving the field point to the boundary, the Eq. (3) and (4) reduce to 
(x) . . . (s, x) (s) (s) . . . (s, x) (s) (s), x ,

where . . .C PV , . . .R PV  and . . .H PV  denote the Cauchy principal value, Riemann principal value 
and Hadamard principal value, respectively. By collocating the field point x outside the domain 
(including boundary), the null-field integral equations yield

where cD  is the complementary domain. The x  point in Eq. (7) and (8) can be in the cD  or 
exactly on the real boundary if appropriate degenerate kernels are expressed. The set of x  is 
closed.

Illustrative examples 
Case1: Two circular cavities lie on the y-axis 
Figures 3 (a) and (b) shows the geometry of the two circles whose radii are 1 1a =  and 2 2a = . 
For the static case, the displacement field of the anti-plane deformation is defined as: 
yw τ
µ
∞
∞ = . (4-31) 
In the dynamic case with traction free condition on the circular boundaries, we assume an 
incident SH-wave with amplitude of linear function in the y  direction as: 
i ikxyw eτ
µ
∞
= . (4-32) 
When k  approaches zero, the problem is reduced to a static case where Honei et al.’s [23] 
solution can be compared with for 2,  0.1D =  and 0.01 . Figures 3 (e) and (f) show the graph of 
the stress zθσ  around the boundary of smaller circle for various distances, D , between the two 
circles. Our numerical results are well compared with the data of Honein et al.’s data [23] when 
k  approaches zero ( 0.001k = ) by using ten Fourier terms ( 10L = ). 
 
Case 2: Membrane vibration for a circular domain with an eccentric circular hole 
An eccentric case with radii 1r  and 2r  ( 1 0.5r = , 2 2.0r = ) is considered as shown in Fig.4-1. 
The boundary condition is subject to the Dirichlet type. Special treatment for vector 
decompositions in potential gradient should be taken care here. Table 1 shows the former five 
eigenvalues by using different methods. Good agreement is made. Fig. 4-2 (a) shows the 
minimum singular value versus k where the drop indicates the possible eigenvalues by using the 
singular formulation. Fig. 4-2 (b) shows the minimum singular value versus k where the drop 
indicates the possible eigenvalues by using the hypersingular formulation. The efficiency and 
accuracy of the present method is obviously shown in Fig. 4-2 (a) and Fig. 4-2 (b). Fig. 4-2 (c) 
shows the minimum singular value versus k where the drop indicates all the true eigenvalues by 
using the Burton & Miller approach. The present method by using the singular formulation agree 
with the analytical results better than BEM [20] does where a spurious eigenvalue appears at 
4.81k =   ( 0 1(4.81 ) 0J r = ) instead of 4.83 in BEM. The present method by using the 
hypersingular formulation agree with the analytical solution better than BEM [20] does where a 
spurious eigenvalue appears at 0.0 and 3.68k = ( 10 1(0 ) 0J r′ =  and 20 1(3.68 ) 0J r′ = ) instead of 
0.35 and 3.77 in BEM. The present method is superior to BEM especially in the low frequency 
range and it is more accurate than BEM under the same number of degree of freedoms. The 
spurious eigenvalue was filtered out by using the Burton and Miller approach. By adopting the 
truncated Fourier series (M=10), the former five mode shapes are compared well with those by 
FEM and BEM also shown in Table 2. For the convergence study of Fourier series, we plot the 
Parseval’s sum versus truncated M terms in Fig. 4-3. It is found that no matter real-part,
