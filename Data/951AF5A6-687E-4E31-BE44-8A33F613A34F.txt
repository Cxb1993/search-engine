摘要 
In this study, we look into an innovative 
technology which utilizes nano-particles as a 
medium for imprinting. This technology 
integrates the advantages of soft lithography, 
photo-cure resist, and gas assisted imprinting. 
We try to produce ridge waveguides and 
micro-lens arrays by gas-assisted 
nano-particles based soft mould imprinting on 
photo-cure resists. It helps the application and 
technology of nano-imprinting becoming 
more sophisticated. 
    We find that PDMS can be used to 
precisely replicate micro-to-nano-meter level 
micro-structures. Together with nano-particles 
and well-proportioned gas pressure, we can 
construct a perfect shape of micro-structures 
and achieve a conformal contact with the 
surface of base material. It increases the 
effective imprinting area significantly and 
improves the replication capability of the 
transfer. Meanwhile, the PDMS soft mould is 
easy for production and fast in replication, 
which reduces the cost remarkably. 
Furthermore, it has a low surface free energy 
and low viscosity to the resists. Integrating gas 
assisted nano-particles imprinting can be a 
great advantage in the process of 
micro-structure.

一、 前言 
UV-NIL technology[1] can be integrated 
into Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL). [2,3] 
Using traditional imprinting, we can apply 
some forces on a cavity with nano-structure, 
and make it in touch with a base plate made 
from some modeling material. A 
complementary pattern of cavity’s 
micro-structure can be transferred to the 
modeling material (some kind of resist that 
can be solidified by UV). The width limit of 
this technology is decided by the mold’s 
characteristic size. Comparing to the optical 
lithography in the semi-conductor process, it’s 
no longer limited by the optical exposure. 
Therefore, if we compare this technology with 
current nano-meter molding technologies such 
as E-beam or Focus Ion Beam[4], we’ll find 
that it’s preponderant in massive production 
and becomes a good choice in the 
manufacture of all kinds of nano-meter level 
optical devices. Although nano-imprinting is 
good in width, the application of this 
technology still has to face the problems like 
how to enlarge the effective imprinting area, 
the uniformity of imprinting, cavity adherence, 
thickness of residual layer, and longevity of 
cavity etc. Usually, we can solve these 
problems by increasing the imprinting force of 
cavity. As a result, most of today’s 
nano-imprinting is accomplished by a pressing 
system. However, when a force is applied on 
the cavity’s structure by the pressure plate, the 
pressure distribution will never be 
well-proportioned for the sake of the way 
solid imprinting works in. Cavity structure 
that is enduring excessive forces will be 
deformed, especially in a large scale 
imprinting. Furthermore, whether the cavity 
material can support increasing pressure is 
also a key factor for the yield rate. Besides the 
pressing system described above, high 
pressure gas is also adopted to provide 
sufficient pressure in recent years.[5] 
Although this technology can reduce the 
imprinting deviation generated by the cavity 
deformation[6], there can be positioning 
deviation or insufficient/asymmetric pressure 
on the cavity, which brings problems on the 
yield rate. 
二、研究目的 
To solve the above issues effectively and 
utilize the rapid and low cost advantage of soft 
mold imprinting and UV solidified replication, 
we design and develop a fluid imprinting 
system based on UV solidified nano-particles. 
Nano-particles are mixed into the gas for a 
well-proportioned and full pressure. The 
following equation explains the differences 
between nano-particles based fluid imprinting 
and normal gas-assisted imprinting. Figure 1 
demonstrates the different molding pressures 
achieved by filling same amount of gas into 
the cavities using different imprinting 
technologies, respectively.

The SU-8 thick film photo-resist adopted 
in this study is made by MicroChem, a U.S. 
based company. It’s an UV solidification 
photo-resist, model 2035. Under 25 , its ℃
dynamic viscosity is 7000 cSt. SU-8 is based 
on Epoxy structure. It’s quite stable and strong 
in structure. Meanwhile, it has a good 
resistance capability against environment 
variety, including temperature, humidity, and 
pH. It’s really a good choice of photo-resist 
material for transferring structural patterns of 
ridge waveguide and micro-lens array. 
Procedures for making micro-to-nano-meter 
devices.  
Here are the steps for making 
micro-to-nano-meter devices using 
nano-particles fluid imprinting on soft mold, 
as shown in Figure 7: (1) daub the SU-8 
photo-resists on the transparent quartz glass 
base plate equably. (2) Put some PDMS molds 
on top of quartz plates, with their structural 
surfaces towards the photo-resists. Then fill 
the mold cavities with photo-resists by 
self-developed gas-assisted nano-particles soft 
mold imprinting system. (3) Solidify the 
photo-resists by lights after the filling is 
completed. (4) Discharge the pressure and 
release the mold. Figure 8 shows the SEM 
photo of the ridge waveguide devices and 
micro-lens arrays replicated on the SU-8 
photo-resists by the above steps.

四、 結果與討論 
In this section, we are going to compare 
the direct cast PDMS soft mold (Figure 4) and 
micro-structure devices replicated by 
nano-particles fluid imprinting (Figure 6) to 
the original silicon wafer mold in their 
replication capacities. From the above SEM 
images, we can find that no matter it’s based 
on original PDMS mold or its copies, the 
replicated micro-structure devices using 
nano-particles fluid soft-mold imprinting 
technology are just fine on both ridge 
waveguides and micro-lens arrays. The 
replicas have flat and smooth side walls. Side 
wall flatness and smoothness are most 
important factors for waveguide devices. As 
long as the original mold has a flat and 
smooth side wall, the replicated structure will 
be able to share its flatness and smoothness, 
no matter it’s a PDMS mold or a waveguide 
structure based on SU-8 photo-resists. 
The imprinting is controlled by particle 
fluid. In this study, we are going to discuss the 
impacts of different pressure parameters 
(1,2,3,4,5 kgf/cm2) on the manufacture of 
micro-lens array. From the experiments we 
can find that the filling and forming of 
micro-lens arrays improve if we increase the 
pressure. If the pressure reaches 5 kgf/cm2, the 
mold cavities will be fully filled, as shown in 
Figure 9. Comparing to normal gas-assisted 
imprinting, the new technology described in 
this study requires much less pressure to 
accomplish the forming.

Abstract 
In this study, we look into an innovative technology which utilizes nano-particles as a medium for imprinting. 
This technology integrates the advantages of soft lithography, photo-cure resist, and gas assisted imprinting. 
We try to produce micro-lens arrays by gas-assisted nano-particles based soft mould imprinting on photo-cure 
resists. It helps the application and technology of nano-imprinting becoming more sophisticated. We find that 
PDMS can be used to precisely replicate micro-to-nano-meter level micro-structures. Together with nano-
particles and well-proportioned gas pressure, we can construct a perfect shape of micro-structures and achieve 
a conformal contact with the surface of base material. It increases the effective imprinting area significantly and 
improves the replication capability of the transfer. Meanwhile, the PDMS soft mould is easy for production and 
fast in replication, which reduces the cost remarkably. Furthermore, it has a low surface free energy and low 
viscosity to the resists. Integrating gas assisted nano-particles imprinting can be a great advantage in the 
process of micro-structure.

Abstract 
Limited by light source wavelength and light diffraction, nanostructure fabrication is tough, but it needs multiple 
special and expensive processes (e.g.: E-beam). The common problems are complex and slow processing, 
expensive manufacturing equipment and material, and it is very unsuitable for mass production; therefore, it’s 
of utmost importance to develop a nanoscale, high resolution and cost efficient next generation semiconductor 
process. This study integrated PDMS soft mold, photo resist(SU-8 2035) and vacuum pumping equipment, as 
well as researched and developed a vacuum-assisted photo resistant microstructure filling technique, and 
combined soft mold to fabricate waveguide microstructure. Conformal contact was obtained between PDMS 
soft mold and substrate surface, with low surface free energy, and resistance of sticking to resist in 
filling.Vacuum equipment was used to enable compact and complete resistant filling, and it can not only greatly 
increase the effective filling area, but, without residue after filling. There is no need for post treatment removing 
of the residual layer; it can well lower cost and reduce process time, so that the microstructure component 
manufacturing technique and application can be more mature.

Abstract 
In this paper, we try to measure the differences among the indentations of single crystal bulks under different 
rotation angles by nanoindentation test. Besides, we also give a design of positioning device for the 
nanoindentation measuring system. It is driven by stepping motors and relevant circuits for controlling the 
rotations of the wafer supporting platform. The drive circuit is connected with microprocessors. The rotation 
angle of the platform can be adjusted by instructions so that the system can be used to carry out 
nanoindentation tests in different angles for more precise mechanical properties data of the nanoindentation 
materials.
