of Z. Let Z be a real topological
vector space with a solid pointed
convex cone C ⊂ Z. Let Γ and Λ
be two (index sets) nonempty sub-
sets of two Hausdorff topological
spaces, respectively. Suppose that
f : Γ × X × X → Z is a parame-
terized vector-valued function, and
that A : Λ → 2X \ {∅} is a con-
straint mapping. We consider the
following parametric vector equi-
librium problem (PVEP, in short):
for given p ∈ Γ and λ ∈ Λ, find
x ∈ A(λ) such that
f(p, x, y) /∈ −intC
for all y ∈ A(λ).
Let Ω(p, λ) be the solution map-
ping Ω(p, λ) of PVEP.
If A is a constant mapping, say
A(λ) = K for all λ ∈ Λ, and
f(p, x, y) = g(x, y) for all p ∈
Γ, x, y ∈ K, then PVEP reduces
to the classical vector equilibrium
problem (VEP, in short). For VEP
and its generalizations, we refer
to [1, 2, 3, 14] and the references
therein.
For given ε ∈ intC, the ε-vector
equilibrium problem is to find x ∈
K such that
g(x, y) + ε /∈ −intC,
for all y ∈ K. Let S(ε) denote the
solution mapping. This problem
studied in [8] is also a special case
of PVEP.
The main purpose of this project
is to investigate some continuity
properties of Ω. We will establish
some existence results of PVEP
and some results on upper semi-
continuity, lower semicontinuity of
the solution mapping Ω of PVEP,
respectively.
3. Results and Discussion
We now establish some existence
results for PVEP as follows.
Ttheorem. Let X be a nonempty
subset of a real Hausdorff topo-
logical vector space X , and Z a
real topological vector space with a
solid pointed convex cone C ⊂ Z.
Let Γ and Λ be two nonempty sets,
respectively. Suppose that A is a
set-valued map from Λ to 2X \ {∅}
and that f is a vector-valued func-
tion from Γ × X × X to Z with
f(p, x, x) /∈ −intC for all p ∈ Γ
and x ∈ X. Also for each p ∈ Γ
and λ ∈ Λ, we assume the follow-
ing conditions:
1. A(λ) is closed and convex for
each λ ∈ Λ;
2. {x ∈ A(λ) : f(p, x, y) ∈
−intC} is open for each y ∈
A(λ);
3. {y ∈ A(λ) : f(p, x, y) ∈
2
Then Ω is u.s.c. on Γ× Λ.
Theorem. Let X be a nonempty
subset of a real Hausdorff topo-
logical vector space X , and Z a
real topological vector space with
a solid pointed convex cone C ⊂
Z. Let Γ be a nonempty subset
of Hausdorff space and Λ an ar-
bitrary set. Suppose that A is a
set-valued map from Λ to 2X \ {∅}
and that f is a vector-valued func-
tion from Γ × X × X to Z with
f(p, x, x) /∈ −intC for all p ∈ Γ
and x ∈ X. Also we assume the
following conditions:
1. A(λ) is compact for each λ ∈
Λ;
2. f(·, ·, y) is (−C)-continuous
on Γ×X for each y ∈ A(λ);
3. Ω(p, λ) 6= ∅ for each p ∈ Γ and
λ ∈ Λ.
Then Ω(·, λ) is u.s.c. on Γ for each
fixed λ ∈ Λ.
Next, we investigate conditions
under which the solutions mapping
of PVEP is lower semicontinuous.
Theorem. Let X be a nonempty
subset of a real Hausdorff topo-
logical vector space X , and Z a
real topological vector space with a
solid pointed convex cone C ⊂ Z.
Let Γ and Λ be two nonempty sub-
sets of two Hausdorff spaces, re-
spectively. Suppose that A is a
set-valued map from Λ to 2X \ {∅}
and that f is a vector-valud func-
tion from Γ × X × X to Z with
f(p, x, x) /∈ −intC for all p ∈ Γ
and x ∈ X. Also we assume that
the following conditions:
1. A is continuous at λ0 and
A(λ0) is compact convex;
2. f is C-continuous on P ×X×
X for a certain neighborhood
P of p0;
3. f(p0, ·, y) is strictly (−C)-
properly quasiconvex onX for
fixed p0 ∈ Γ and each y ∈ X;
4. for fixed p0 ∈ Γ and λ0 ∈ Λ,
Ω(p0, λ0) contains at least two
points.
Then Ω is l.s.c. at (p0, λ0).
