2low speed manufacturing. Therefore, the using of automatic inspection to improve the overall quality and
reliability is even more important.
Related research of nonwoven and fabric defect inspection in the past, Hu et al. [2] adopted best wavelet
packet bases and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to inspect missing ends, missing picks, and oily
and broken fabric. In their research, the important design issues in building an artificial neural network
classifier were to find an appropriate network topology (number of hidden layers, number of processing
elements in each layer) and the weights between the processing elements in different layers. Tilocca et al. [3]
used artificial neural network to detect fabric defects such as large knot, slub, broken thread, and knot.
Besides, they proved artificial neural network had powerful learning ability from experimental results.
However, disadvantages are as followed if BPNN was to be the classifier: the global minimum cannot be
obtained if the number of learning cycles is not enough; to increase the learning rate, the momentum factor
must be increased. However, back and forth oscillations are caused if the momentum factor is too large,
causing the difficulty of convergence drawback. Therefore this paper proposes the improvable methods
regarding to the issues of BPNN. By using the Taguchi method within the experiment process, effectiveness
equally to the full factorial experiment can be obtained with extremely few runs of experiments, and to
achieve the optimized learning parameters combination. This improves the overly time-consuming drawback
of BPNN which uses trial-and-error method to adjust the learning parameters. This enables the network to
converge even faster, having an even smaller convergence error and better recognition rate, and making the
network to have an even better reliability.
Furthermore, since the appearance of nonwoven and fabric defects is related with localized deformation
of the regular texture pattern, therefore the selection of having texture discrimination feature is to be
apparently important. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is representative for feature expression
methods in texture analysis [4]. The method is by constructing a spatial gray level co-occurrence matrix with
probability density functions of the gray level of particular adjacent positions from the pixels of the original
image. It is thus suitable to describe the nonwoven and fabric defects in the texture feature.
2. Research Methods
The research uses charge-coupled device (CCD) to gather the surface image of the nonwoven and fabric,
and to study the features on the surface of the nonwoven and fabric, which by using these features to classify
unknown nonwoven and fabric types. Specifications of the hardware are: Sony XC-711 CCD, Matroc II PCI
interface image grabbing card. The nonwoven and fabric defect images are as shown in Figure 1. The image is
in 256 grey levels, the size is of 512×512 pixels. The features collecting of the nonwoven and fabric image
was done by GLCM to calculate the features of the nonwoven and fabric images, and then using the
Taguchi-based BPNN as the classifier.
2.1 Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix
This paper uses gray level co-occurrence matrix to define the feature of the nonwoven and fabric. The
feature of the GLCM is by observing the gray level relation of a pixel pair at the same geological position, and
to quantitatively determine the occurrence chance of a certain gray level appearance feature of the pixel pair.
The method is described as below:

The definition of the selected texture feature index in this study was as follow:

Contrast:  

ijP|ji| (2)
Correlation:  
i j
ij |ji|P (3)
where ijP is the co-occurrence matrix after normalization. For the co-occurence matrix, d=1, θ=0
.and 45.
The defect image was then calculated by GLCM and the achieved normalized co-occurrence matrix was
substituted into the three defined feature indexes, in which to calculate the texture feature of the nonwoven
andfabric. Once we obtained the image’s feature, BPNN was used to carry on training.
2.2 Taguchi Method
The characteristic of the Taguchi method lies within by using an orthogonal array to plan the
signal-to-noise ratio (SN ratio) to analyze experimental data. The use of orthogonal array to design
experiments and with the SN ratio to analyze experimental data enables the designer to simultaneously study
the effect of multiple control factors to the average of quality characteristic and variance in a fast and
economical way. Thus within the process of the experiment just by using extremely few experimental runs, an
equal full factorial experiment is created to obtain the optimized learning parameters combination [5-16].
Parameter design in the Taguchi method converts the quality characteristics into an SN ratio in order to
evaluate the statistical values of the performance. The object of the research was to make the
root-mean-square-error of the BPNN as lower as possible. The selected quality characteristic was therefore
the smaller-the-better, and the SN ratio was as shown below:
)n/ylog(10 2 (4)
where y was the measured value and n was the total number of measurements.

As shown in Table 2, the use of extremely few experimental runs can achieve an equally full factorial
experiment, to obtain the optimized learning parameters combination among, and to improve the overly time
consuming trial-and-error drawback. Since the quality target of this experiment was in hope the lower RMSE
the better for the network convergence, therefore the design of parameters were selected by the
small-the-better. For the planned nine sets of experiment, each set collected five experimental measurements,
took the average and according to equation (4) calculated the SN ratios.

The BPNN in this research has six input neurons and seven output neurons; the six input neurons of the
input layer were respectively six defined features, the seven output neurons of the output layer were
respectively seven different fabrics. As the BPNN was proceeding with learning, 3500 feature images were
collected (500 each of the seven types of defect) and became the training data set after normalization. The
target output vector (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) was defined to represent nonwoven, (0,1,0,0,0,0,0) for laddering,
(0,0,1,0,0,0,0) for end-out, (0,0,0,1,0,0,0) for hole, (0,0,0,0,1,0,0) for oil spot, (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) for dye stain and
(0,0,0,0,0,0,1) for crease mark.
After the completion of executing the nine sets of orthogonal array experiments, the response graph as
shown in Figure 4 could be obtained by using main effect analysis. The optimized BPNN learning parameters
can be achieved from the figure. Based from the main effect analysis, the learning parameters combination
sequence from large to small was D1, C3, B3, and A1. Once the network has completed the learning, its
8optimized learning parameters combination. This can efficiently improve the BPNN drawback with overly
time consuming trial-and-error for finding the learning parameters. Finally by the 700 test images it was
proved that the Taguchi-based BPNN can efficiently classify fabric types, and the recognition rate can reach
97.86%.

Abstract—This study proposed to use wavelet transfer to
acquire image features, and use back-propagation neural
network to classify type of textile texture. Firstly, wavelet
transfer is applied to obtain vertical, horizontal and diagonal
images of original image, and compute its wavelet energy to
take them as texture features of this image. Finally, the back-
propagation neural network is adopted to recognize texture
feature of this image. As indicated by experimental result, this
system can recognize accurately texture in woven fabric.
Among 350 test samples in total, the general recognition rate
amounts to 96%. Therefore, this study succeeded in building
the automatic computer visual inspection system to recognize
textile texture type, which can greatly improve and avoid
current low efficiency, non-objective judgment and labor waste
due to human inspection.
Keywords- neural network; wavelet transform; textile texture
I. INTRODUCTION
Recognition of textile texture is a very crucial reference
index to fabric quality control. Most of conventional
inspections of textile texture were manual; operator’s rich 
experience was relied on to check textile texture directly by
visual inspection, followed by documentation. Such work
was tedious, eye sight and labor consuming, and susceptible
to inspection negligence, the quality was hard to control. But
training of professional cloth inspection operator was time-
consuming, and could not get effect in short time, therefore,
how to inherit past experience of textile inspectors, aid in
freshman learning, so as to reach recognition accuracy, save
cost and raise capacity, was the motive of this study, thus to
set up a set of accurate inspection system of textile texture
had its urgent need.
Computer vision is the science that develops the
theoretical and algorithmic basis by which useful
information can be automatically extracted and analyzed
from an observed image using computations made by
computers. Although research on human vision has
progressed well in recent years, the use of computers to
simulate human vision is still problematic and the use of
computer vision in the automation of processes in the textile
industry is still a major challenge. Due to the uneven surface
made by the yarn structure the reflection of light affects the
appearance of texture on the fabric surface. Therefore, by
analyzing the fabric texture it might theoretically be possible
to identify the weaving pattern and the texture type of the
fabric.
According to research made in previous literature,
Scharcanski [1] indicated that several continuous
manufacturing processes use stochastic texture images for
quality control and monitoring. Large amounts of pictorial
data are acquired, providing both important information
about the materials produced and about the manufacturing
processes involved. However, it is often difficult to measure
objectively the similarity among such images, or to
discriminate between texture images of materials with
distinct properties. The degree of discrimination required by
industrial processes sometimes goes beyond the limits of
human visual perception. His work presented a new method
for multi-resolution stochastic texture analysis, interpretation
and discrimination based on the wavelet transform. A multi-
resolution distance measure for stochastic textures is
proposed, and applications of his method in the non-woven
textiles industry are reported. Kuo and Tsai adopted the
learning vector quantization networks as a classifier to
categorize the fabric nature and the type of weaving texture
[2]. The experimental result showed that this approach could
automatically and accurately classify the fabric nature,
including woven fabric, knitted fabric and non-woven fabric,
and the type of its main weaving texture, such as plain, twill
or satin weave, single or double knitted and non-woven
fabric. Kuo et al. applied back-propagation neural network to
distinguish defects including holes, oil stains, warp-lacking,
and weft-lacking [3]. Hu and Tsai [4] employed best wavelet
packet bases and back-propagation neural network to inspect
missing ends, missing picks, and oily and broken fabric. Kuo
and Kao used self-organizing map network as the classifier
[5]. And then the experiment result shows that the study can
automatically and accurately classify the fabric types
(including shuttle-woven fabric, jersey fabric and non-woven
fabric) and main texture type of the fabric (such as plain
weave, twill weave, satin weave, single jersey, double jersey
and non-woven fabric).
In addition, back-propagation neural network (BPNN)
has evident advantage in classification [6], [7]. Therefore,
this present research will combine the advantages of the
BPNN to enhance the recognization rate for automatic
inspecting textile texture type.

In above equations, is learning rate, k and j are
thresholds from output layer to hidden layer and from input
layer to hidden layer respectively, while ijW and jkW are
weight correct functions of input layer with respect to hidden
layer, and hidden layer with respect to output layer. In
network learning process, there were sometimes problems of
local extremity and problem of excessive or insufficient
weight correction, the weight correction formula was as
follows:
n1n WXW   (16)
where 1nW  is the (n+1)th weight correction, nW is the
nth weight correction, is the momentum factor.
Its learning process is often done in the way of one
training datum once, till training data are learnt, which is a
learning epoch, a network can train data to repeat learning
epoch, till network learning reaches convergence. This study
used BPNN of a hidden layer, 4 input units and 1 output
units to carry out offline training and online classification of
textile texture image.
In order to test learning effect, data are usually divided
into two portions at random when inputting data before
learning, one portion is training data, the other is test data.
One may load test data to network every several learning
cycles, to test if network error degree converges to
reasonable range. Test method of mean square error (MSE)

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The signal decomposition diagram of the two-
dimensional wavelet transform is shown in Fig. 2, where cA
means the wavelet coefficient of low frequency, the number
means decomposition layer, and cH, cV, cD each represent
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal high frequency wavelet
signals. Fig. 3 shows that image decomposition of single
layer wavelet transform.

After extracting features by using (3), the training
process of BPNN could be conducted. Prior to running the
BPNN, the test data must be normalized. Both the hidden
layer and the output layer of this experiment are Logsig
transfer functions, which can only treat data from 0 to 1, thus,
this experiment sets its normalization range at 0 to 1. After
normalization, the data are input into the BPNN. The
normalization formula is shown as follows:
 
   minminmaxminmax

XX
X 

where, oldX is the value to normalize; maxX is the maximum
of the statistical variables; minX is the minimum of the
statistical variables; maxD is the maximum required for
normalization; and minD is the minimum required for
normalization.
Since the learning rate and inertia factor affect the
network converging speed, and the number of hidden layer
nodes affects the network complexity, the training examples
were used to set the network learning parameters. The
learning rate and inertia factor are generally set between 0
and 1, specifically, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9
were set in the experiment. To calculate the number of
hidden layer nodes: (number of input layer nodes＋number
of output layer nodes)/2, thus it was set as 3. After 10000
learning cycles, the best convergence occurred when the
learning rate was 0.8 and the inertia factor was 0.4, and MSE
was converged to 0.000323.
