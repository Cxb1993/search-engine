Abstract
We setup the photocatalytic spinning optical
disc reactor that based on the
light-guide-able optical disc coated with
photocatalytic thin film. We want to resolve
the increasingly serious problem on the
pollution of drinking water or the fast
increase of the green house gases, e.g. CO2,
or the toxic gases, e.g. SiOx, NOx. The new
photocatalytic reactor has high mass transfer
rate and high processing efficiency closed to
the typical slurry bed reactor but no need to
retrieve the nano- or micro- photocatalytic
particles. Also, the transparent optical
circular disc guides the incident light along
lateral direction. The guided light is totally
reflected at the disc/air interface except
absorbing by the photocatalytic thin film but
not extracted to the polluted liquid or gases.
The efficiency of light using in
photocatalytic optical disc will be much
increased with optimizing the manipulation
of light in the photocatalytic reactor in this
project.
This project is prospect green technology of
power saving, carbon reduction,
reduced-size reactor, waste reduction, and
resources saving on operation. The final
results will be helpful on the leading
development of advanced green technology.
KeyWOrds: water pollution, light diffuser,
photocatalytic optical disc, photocatalytic
optical disc reactor, spin optical disc reactor,

二、報告內容
In the report, we would like to put the
report in two parts as followed:
(1) Photocatalytic optical disc reactor for
water treatment:
Introduction
In 1972, A. Fujishima and K. Honda
44 sets of opposite arranged cobalt magnets.
Three types of samples were prepared
for investigation and comparison. Step 1,
60nm of thin film of oxygen reduced
titanium dioxide (TiOx) was sputtered with
radio frequency (RF) sputtering coater and
TiO2 target on polycarbonate substrate (120
mm in diameter, 0.6 nm in thickness, a
co-centered circular hole with 15 mm in
diameter). The TiOx layer can be the
adhesive layer for fixing the P25 TiO2
nanoparticles (P25, Evonic industry,
Degussa, Germany) and protect the
polycarbonate substrate from UV damage.
Step 2, the coating of P25 TiO2
nanoparticles is modified from the work of
H. C. Yatmaz et. al..10 The polycarbonate
substrates with TiOx thin film were
immersed in the P25 gel solution (0.5 g P25
in 50 cc DI water) for 1 mins, and then
hot-baked on a hot plate at 90 °C for 1 hr
after taking out. The sample discs were then
showered with large volume of clean water
to wash off the unfixed P25 TiO2
nanoparticles and ready for use after directly
dried in air. The photocatalytic optical disc
deposited with P25 TiO2 nanoparticles is
durable for long time use. Two months after
preparation of the sample, its photocatalytic
processing efficiency has only slightly
decline, not more than 3 %, under several
times of UV shining for tens of hours and
pouring of large volume water.
Step 3, the gold nanoparticles with
mean size of 20 nm is then fixed on TiO2
nanoparticles with the help of UV mercury
lamps. The 20 times diluted 20 nm gold
colloidal solution (G1652-25ML,
concentration ~0.01% as HAuCl4, Sigma) is
dispensed onto the sample disc that fixed in
the photocatalytic optical disc reactor,
maintained spinning at 30 rpm. The sample
C is adding 14 ml of diluted gold colloidal
solution. The photocatalytic optical disc was
illuminated with light source 1 until the disc
was fully dried and then hot baked on a hot
plate with 90 °C for 1 hour. According to the
measurement by energy dispersive
spectrometers X-ray fluorescence
(EDS-XRF) in scanning electron microscope,
the amount of the deposited gold
nanoparticles is smaller than 1 weight
percent of the deposited P25. Using visible
light, the particle size should be around 10
to 15 nm to induce surface plasmon
resonance on metallic nanoparticle. Our
method has great benefits for surface
plasmon resonance induction for enhancing
the photocatalytic reaction.
Typical photo-deposition generates
only small gold nanoparticles (about several
nm) on surface of TiO2 nanoparticles that
reduced from the Au3+ in HAuCl4 solution
under shinning of UV light. If the deposition
time is too long for purchasing larger
particle size, the active sites of the TiO2
photocatalyst are all covered to core-shell
structure. The photocatalytic reaction is not
process able without revealing the active
sites to the target material in solution.
As shown in Fig. 5, the P25 is high
refractive index and strong light scattering
material, so the adding of P25 TiO2
nanoparticles on TiOx layer increases the
extinction of visible light. Adding gold
nanoparticles further increases the
absorption of light at only 500-1000 nm.
This is attributed to the induction of surface
plasmon resonance at the joint of gold
nanoparticles and TiO2 nanoparticles.
Results and Discussions
As shown in Fig. 6, the averaged
absorption measured by spectrum meter
(G1103A, HP, USA) of the sample solution
within 465 nm to 475 nm is linearly
depended on the concentration of the methyl
orange. The absorption peak of methyl
orange is 469 nm. Therefore, we can use the
methyl orange to clearly identify the
processing efficiency of photocatalytic
reactor. We use a in-circulation-loop
homemade real time monitoring system with
a 468 nm light LED and a computer
controlled USB power meter (PM100USB,
Thorlabs, USA) to monitoring the light
absorption of light around 468 nm for
calculating the reserved methyl orange in
solution. We calculate the remained ratio as
C/C0 (the Y axis) to describe the process of
the photocatalytic reaction. The C0 and C is
the concentration of methyl orange before
and after the treatment.
As shown in Fig. 7, the effect of the
6photocatalytic optical disc reactor, there are
several extra benefits. First, the
photocatalytic optical disc was built up with
low cost deposition method to fix the TiO2
nanoparticles onto the polycarbonate
substrate with no further high temperature
calcination process. The photocatalytic
optical disc is able of mass fabrication with
little cost. Second, the efficiency of
photocatalytic reaction is very high and
large amount of the target pollutants in the
untreated solution can be deducted within a
very short processing time. Third, the plastic
circular disc substrate is light transparent
and has good mechanical strength. It can be
good light guide for surface plasmon
resonance induction and support
large-volume liquid pouring. And for the
most important, they can be recycled from
the wastes. Therefore, it is a very important
green technology with using modern optical
method to further improve the already exist
instrument or machine. We have not only
developed a brand new instrument of spin
disc type reactor but also supply an
environmental benefit technology that based
on green photonics.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a
homemade photocatalytic optical disc
reactor for speed up photocatalytic treatment
of waste water. Use of the photocatalytic
optical disc with gold nanoparticles loaded
TiO2 processes better efficiency of
photocatalytic reaction under illumination of
both red LED lamps and low pressure
mercury tube lamps than that with only
mercury lamps. Our results demonstrate the
10 % enhancement at most on the
processing efficiency of photocatalytic
reaction with incoherent red light of 637 nm.
The 637 nm can only have surface plasmon
resonance induction on gold nanoparticles.
With comparison of different sample
photocatalitic optical disc processing under
Hg lamps w/wo LED lamp, we successfully
get a direct evidence for surface plasmon
resonance enhancement of photocatalytic
reaction with our reactor.

from the light guiding, we introduce the
techniques from integrated optics to the
chemical facilities for green photonics that
uses light more efficiently. From the results
that shown in Fig. 2, only 60 % of 637 nm
light compare to that of 300 nm light is
reduced with “extinction” as perpendicularly
penetrates the POD. However the extinction
is combination of light absorption and
scattering process. The light for inducing
SPR is not sufficiently absorbed and used.
However, as the light for SPR is guiding
inside the substrate of polycarbonate disc,
the light energy is gradually dispense to the
gold NPs through times total internal
reflection. The light energy is effectively
used.12
Sample preparation
The POD samples were prepared for
investigation and comparison. Step 1, 60nm
of TiOx thin film was sputtered by radio
frequency (RF) sputtering coater and TiO2
target on PC substrate (120 mm in diameter,
0.6 nm in thickness, a co-centered circular
hole with 15 mm in diameter). The TiOx
layer can be the adhesive layer of the P25
TiO2 NPs and can protect the PC substrate
from UV damage. Step 2, the coating of P25
TiO2 NPs (P25, mean size 23 nm, Evonic
industry, Degussa, Germany) is modified
from the work of H. C. Yatmaz et. al..10 The
PC substrates with TiOx thin film were
cover with the P25 gel solution (0.5 g P25 in
50 cc DI water) for 1 mins, and then
hot-baked on a hot plate at 90 °C for 1 hr
after removing the P25 gel solution. The
sample discs were then showered with large
volume of clean water to wash off the
unfixed P25 NPs and ready for use after
directly dried in air. The deposited P25 NPs
is durable for long time use. Two months
after preparation of the sample, its
photocatalytic processing efficiency has
declined not more than 5 %, under times of
photocatalytic processing test. Step 3, the
gold NPs with mean size of 20 nm is then
fixed on TiO2 NPs with the help of UV Hg
lamps. The 20 nm gold colloidal solution
(G1652-25ML, concentration ~0.01% as
HAuCl4, Sigma), dilute 20 times, is
dispensed onto the sample disc that fixed in
the PODR, maintained spinning at 30 rpm.
The POD was illuminated with light source
1 until the disc was fully dried and then hot
baked on a hot plate with 90 °C for 1 hour.
Results and Discussions
Fig.2 shows the absorption spectrum of
the POD Sample in condition of different
steps of fabrication as the absorption of the
PC substrate was deducted. The black line
A show that the absorption band edge for
fixed P25 on blank PC substrate is about 293
nm. The red line B shows that adhesion of
P25 (TiO2 NPs) onto the TiOx layer
increases its absorption of light from about
300 nm to 1100 nm. This may attribute to
that the TiOx is oxygen reduction material
and have some effects on the light
absorption of P25. The green line C shows
that adhesion of gold NPs onto the P25 NPs
further increases its absorption of light.
Calculate the difference of samples before
and after coating gold NPs, as shown in blue
line D, the broad-band absorption (0.3 - 0.4)
from 500 nm to 900 nm is found. This is
attributed to the induced SPR at the joint of
gold NPs and TiO2 NPs. The dot square
denotes the output wavelength of the light
source 2, red LED, which is located within
the broad absorption band.
For providing a detailed
characterization on the photocatalytic
processing efficiency of different POD
samples, we present the photocatalytic
degradation of methyl orange (MO) in water
solution. The averaged absorption measured
by spectrum meter (G1103A, HP, USA) of
the sample solution within 465 nm to 475
nm is linearly depended on the concentration
of the MO. The Y axis is the untreated ratio
content of C/C0 that was used to describe the
processing efficiency of photocatalytic
reaction. The C0 and C is the concentration
of MO before and after the treatment,
respectively.
Fig. 3 (a) shows the dependence of
photocatalytic activity of POD with LED
illumination in according to the adding
amount of gold NPs. The x axis describes
times of adding gold NPs, 2 mL colloidal
solution in a time, onto the same POD for
times of the process step 3. The 10 μM 10 
12
From our results, we can suggest that
attaching the metal NPs with size at around
20 nm can carry SPR and enhance the
photocatalytic reaction. After optimization
of the ratio of metal NPs or TiO2 NPs, we
should have a ultra-high efficiency new
material for using the full spectrum of solar
light that mostly are the visible light. Our
work is not only limited to the
environmental benefit development of new
types of high efficiency photocatalyst.
Furthermore, the energy harvesting
efficiency of dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cell
can also be greatly improved. It also can be
introduced to the development of new types
of hybrid system that want to take the
advantage of SPR on metal NPs, such as
solar cell, LED emission, SERS, etc..
Conclusions
In conclusion, we suggest a smart modified
photo-deposition method to develop a
hybrid system of Au (20 nm)/TiO2 (22 nm)
nanoparticle. With this hybrid system, we
demonstrate that SPR can greatly enhance
the processing efficiency of photocatalytic
reaction. With the photocatalytic optical disc
(POD) carrying Au/TiO2 hybrids, it is
demonstrated the 30% enhancement at most
on the processing efficiency of
photocatalytic reaction with incoherent red
light of 637 nm. It is very important for the
development of the material for the
environmental benefit technologies that
relative to light harvest or delivering.
