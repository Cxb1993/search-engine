Abstract 
 
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can differentiate into cells of connective tissue 
lineages, including cartilage. To overcome the limiting autogenous chondrocyte populations 
available in cartilage repair, various methods have been developed to maximize chondrogenesis 
of hMSCs in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of cartilage fragments for 
chondrogenesis of MSCs in a nude mice model with MSCs in fibrin glue and developed a favor 
method for cartilage repair. 
The results of the cartilage fragments-fibrin glue-MSC constructs presented round and 
elongated chondrocyte-like appearance with positive stain of GAG which inducted into cartilage 
tissue. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis showed the gene expression of aggrecan, type II, X collagen, 
and sox-9 increased over time in the cartilage fragments-fibrin glue-MSC constructs. However, 
there was no gene expression of type II collagen in control group, and suggesting the MSCs in 
fibrin glue without cartilage fragments did not differentiate into chondrocytes. Therefore, we 
supposed the cartilage fragments have potential to help chondrogenic induction of MSCs in the 
environment of fibrin glue.

frozen in liquid nitrogen. After then, the cartilage tissues were cryopreserved at -80  refrigerator 
for three weeks. Before used, the articular cartilage parts of the tissues were minced with a 
surgical knife into small fragments. During the sample preparation process, the cartilage tissues 
were immersed in the DPBS solution. 
 
Preparation of Constructs 
The human immortalized bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were serially trypsinized. 
The minced articular cartilage fragments, fibrinogen (Sigma), and thrombin (Sigma) were ready 
to use. In brief, the cell suspension containing 6x106 MSCs and 30 mg minced cartilage 
fragments were mixed together in a 2 ml eppendroff. After centrifugation, discarded the 
supernatant and the cartilage-MSC mixture was obtained. Added 100 l of fibrinogen (20 mg/ml) 
into the eppendroff and well mixed. Then, added 100  of thrombin (50 U/ml) into the mixture. 
After stood for several minutes to gelatinize, the cartilage-fibrin glue-BMMSC construct was 
acquired. Moreover, the amount of cartilage fragments was raised from 30 mg to 60 mg in the 
constructs as another group. The fibrin glue-MSC constructs without minced cartilage fragments 
were as a control group. 
 
In-Vivo Study 
Eighteen nude mice provided by Animal Technology Institute Taiwan were used in this study. 
The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.5% pentobarbital. Shortly, as Fig. 1, 
the constructs were implanted subcutaneously into the back of nude mice. They were raised in 
specific-pathogen-free condition.

RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis 
Total RNA was isolated by using the Trizol purification system according to the manufacture 
(Invirogen). Reverse transcription (RT) of total RNA to single-stranded cDNA was completed by 
using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kits (Applied Biosystems) as described.  
The histological analysis showed that round and elongated chodrocyte-like appearance with 
positive Alcain blue staining was observed in cartilage fragments-MSCs-fibirn glue constructs 
(Fig. 3 and 4). However, the cells in fibrin glue were condensed like MSCs in pellet (Fig. 5). 
Interesting, we have noted that MSCs have migrated into adjacent cartilage fragments, such as the 
creeping substitute in bone.

not differentiate into cartilage tissue. In addition, the mRNA level of type II collagen in the 
cartilage (60 mg)-fibrin glue-MSC constructs significantly raised after 4 weeks of implantation. 
Type X collagen is one of the characteristics of hypertrophic cartilage tissue which will go into 
bone tissue. Unfortunately, the gene expression of type X collagen in study groups with cartilage 
fragments was significantly increased after 4 weeks, and thus further study would be necessary to 
clarify the hypertrophy of MSC chondrogenesis. Sox-9 expression is important for chondrogenic 
differentiation after mesenchymal condensation, and inhibits the transition from chondrocyte 
proliferation to hypertrophy [9], a process that is detrimental to tissue engineering because it can 
lead to apoptosis, vascular invasion, and calcification. Our analysis indicated that sox-9 
expression remained low in three constructs.
