  Report of Accomplishments for NSC Project: 99-2221-E-009-033 
This document provides the report of the research conducted for the NSC project 99-2221-E-009-033 
which had been done and completed over the period from August 2010 to July 2011. 
  In modern communication technology, the receiving terminal needs to be as small as possible, but the 
tradeoff is low radiation efficiency and bandwidth. In this NSC project, we use two different kinds of 
structures, single-band and multi-band antennas to demonstrate our idea about how to increase the efficiency 
of the miniaturized antenna.  
The idea is as follows, for an antenna which has low radiation efficiency, we try to build another 
resonant frequency band which has higher efficiency, shift the new band to the original one, and then we 
find the phenomenon of increasing the efficiency of the original band as the new band moves toward it. Here, 
we use the spiral as a based antenna which has lower efficiency, and we use a split ring resonator (SRR) as a 
shifted-band antenna. We choose SRR since it usually has higher efficiency band than the spiral and it is 
easier to fabricate.  
Meanwhile, we shift the SRR band in two ways, one is tuning the feeding line length, which is 
introduced in Section I. Another is using a modified SRR which is shown in Section II. There is one more 
thing should be mentioned here that is what we proposed in the project is a mechanism rather than an 
antenna, which means the antenna we design here is only a kind of medium to show our ideas, as you can 
see that even though the improved absolute value of efficiency is not so high, the improved ratio is 
appreciable. 
 
Section I: Single Band with Improved Radiation Efficiency and Bandwidth 
 
Compact antennas are very required in today's communication systems. Typical difficulties encountered 
when designing compact antennas include narrow bandwidth and low radiation efficiency [1] [2]. 
Transmission line metamaterials (TL-MTM) provide a way to expand the bandwidth and obtain good 
radiation efficiency performance [3]. The advantages of the split ring resonator (SRR) are its small electrical 
size at resonance, absence of magnetoelectric coupling, and easy fabrication. The investigations herein are 
thus based on the SRR to design compact antennas. Using lumped elements with SRRs also provides a way 
to achieve both compactness and improved radiation efficiency while still being simple in structure [4]. 
However, TL-MTM designs usually produce complex geometries, and the use of lumped elements 
encounters the risk of device breakdown. In this communication, we present a new compact microstrip patch 
antenna design without engaging lumped elements and which enjoys structural simplicity. It entails a novel 
type of spiral and an outer square-type SRR. And we divide to two sections, which are single band and 
mutli-band. Those two cases both are designed to have improved radiation efficiency and bandwidth. 
 
A. Tunable Dual Band  
 The geometry of the antenna is shown in Fig. 1 (top and side views). A polypropylene substrate (εr = 2.2, 
loss tangent = 0.0002 at 1MHz) is used for both layers. On the lower slab rests the feed line while a 
square-type SRR with a metallic circular-type spiral within is printed on the upper layer. This inner spiral is

C. Increase Radiation Efficiency 
Generally, the radiation efficiency is inversely related to the antenna electrical size, thus posing a 
problem at low frequencies. This shall be addressed in this section. In some papers, researchers increase the 
thickness of antenna to get higher efficiency. Here, we propose another concept to increase efficiency of 
antenna. As the two resonances get closer to each other, the radiation efficiency of the lower band increases, 
as shown in Fig. 5(a). Here, the lower band f01 is fixed while the upper frequency f02 is shifted towards. The 
increase in the efficiency at f01 is about 150% (10.2% to 30.1%). Therefore, by merging two resonances, we 
can achieve a better radiation efficiency of the low frequency band. Upon merging, the maximum radiation 
efficiency is 55% at 1.7GHz and 53% at the operation frequency of 1.69GHz. If the upper band is

Section II: Multiband with Improved Radiation Efficiency and Bandwidth 
 
Nowadays in antenna design, apart from the requirement for wideband and high total efficiency, 
miniaturization is also an important aspect for consideration. To make an antenna compact is not that 
difficult, and so is creating one with high total efficiency, but to devise an antenna that possesses all these 
advantages will be a great challenge. 
   So far, most of the studies presented in the literature on dual band compact antennas did not mention the 
values of the total efficiency [6] at low operation frequencies (f < 2GHz) as they were mostly small. In this 
research project, we propose a novel and simple configurable multi-band compact microstrip antenna based 
on a newly-invented modification of the SRR (Split Ring Resonator) and a metallic spiral to demonstrate our 
method for improving the total efficiency: by merging two operation frequencies to increase the total 
efficiency of the lower band without using any lumped elements. The design considered herein is inspired 
by the antenna studied in [7], for which we aim to increase the efficiency by changing the inner SRR there to 
a spiral here. We prefer using total efficiency to radiation efficiency here, because if the reflection efficiency 
(being 1 – |S11|2) is low due to high return loss (|S11|), then the power will still not get emitted well even if 
the radiation efficiency is high. So it will be better to observe the total efficiency, being the true performance 
indicator of an antenna. 
   The proposed antenna is shown in Fig. 1 and the dimensions will be provided in the next section.  
At first, we use a spiral to create a dual band antenna, and as an important fact, a pin is added to 
short-circuit the spiral to the ground plane so as to obtain compactness. In addition to miniaturization, 
another reason for choosing the spiral is because as compared to other complicated structures [8] which also 
have dual band performance, it is much simpler to manufacture and of higher elegance. There are many 
ways to create a dual band compact antenna in the literature, but many of them use materials of high 
permittivities as substrates which cause low radiation efficiencies ([6], [9]). In this project, we propose an 
antenna that is compact even with materials of low dielectric constants.  
After creating the dual band performance of the shorted spiral, we use the SRR to create another band 
which has a higher total efficiency than those of the spiral-attributed bands and use it to merge with the 
lower of the two bands established by the spiral towards the aim of increasing the total efficiency. The lower 
band of the metallic spiral is chosen for the merging in expectation of miniaturization. 
 
Definition of the Antenna 
In this section, the design basis and the structure of the antenna are presented. As mentioned, the concept 
of this configuration is extended from the design of [7]. The antenna is composed of three layers, as shown 
in Fig. 2. The bottom first layer constitutes the feeding layer, which consists of a microstrip feed line and the 
ground plane as depicted in Fig. 2a. The second layer is the radiation layer of the spiral (Fig. 2b) which is 
shorted to the ground plane via a metallic pin without touching the feeding line. The topmost third layer 
comprises the radiation layer of the SRR, modified to possess two rectangular-shaped metallic strip-type 
stubs that extend inwards from the two ends of the split ring as shown in Fig. 2c, serving as a configurable 
mechanism to adjust the operation frequency. The SRR is a good element applied here since it usually has a 
high total efficiency with the size we proposed, and it is also simple to manufacture.

Initially, we use the spiral to create a dual band antenna with its lower operation frequency having relatively 
low total efficiency as typical of small dual band antennas. Then we use our modified SRR to create a new 
band having a total efficiency that is higher than that of either band contributed by the spiral, and develop a 
configurable mechanism to merge the newly added band with the lower band of the spiral to raise its total 
efficiency. 
 
Simulation Results 
In this section, the simulation results of the electric field distribution, the value of |S11|, and the total 
efficiency are provided. Since the first step is to create a dual band performance, we do not need the SRR 
initially. The frequency responses of the |S11| with and without the SRR in free space are shown in Fig. 3. 
This SRR is for the case when it initially does not have strip-stubs, i.e. k = 0. We can see that an additional 
operation band appears near 1.97GHz after the SRR is inserted without influencing the operation band of the 
spiral.  
Fig. 4 presents 2D color plots of the electric field distribution from the top view at three selected 
frequencies (a) 1.78GHz, (b) 1.97GHz, and (c) 2.64GHz. It is clear that the spiral contributes to the 
excitation of the lower operation frequency at 1.78GHz whereas the middle operation frequency at 1.97GHz 
is attributed to the SRR, and the higher operation frequency at 2.64GHz is excited by both the spiral and 
SRR.

Self-Evaluation of the Project and Concluding Remarks 
 
This NSC project had been successfully carried out, producing a considerable amount of research output and 
decent number of publications [7], [10], [11]. The main objectives and goals originally laid out have been 
adequately satisfied. It is believed that the fruits borne by this project have opened the doors to more 
important investigations into the areas of metamaterials and as inspiration for novel microstrip antennas with 
improved performance in terms of multifunctionality, compactness and increased efficiency.

II. DEFINITION OF THE ANTENNA
In this Section, the proposed antenna is described. Fig. 1
shows the top and side views of the antenna. Since it has a
grounded dielectric and a printed metallization, it can be clas-
sified as a microstrip patch antenna. The radiating face is com-
posed of two concentric split rings with opposite gaps and short-
circuited to the ground plane at one end of each ring as for PIFA
antennas. The antenna is fed by a microstrip line placed beside
the rings as shown in Fig. 1, although another type of excitation
could be also possible as will be demonstrated later. The dielec-
tric material of the substrate has a low permittivity, as antennas
would have typically in order to provide good radiation charac-
teristics.
Fig. 2 shows the (simulated and measured) for such an an-
tenna whose arbitrary dimensions are as follow (with reference
to Fig. 1 for the notations): mm, mm, mm,
mm and mm; for a substrate of PVC
with 3 mm thickness. As the Figure shows for both simulation
and measurement, there are two bands of operation related to
the resonances established by the SSRs, although the bands are
not well matched in this example. The operation frequencies ob-
tained by simulations fit properly with the measurements. The
electric field distributions for both modes are shown in Fig. 3.
Assuming the antenna is in the plane, the main field com-
ponent is as it would typically be for patch antennas. The
inner ring mainly contributes to the excitation of the higher res-
onance frequency whereas the outer one to that of the lower fre-
quency. In addition the separation between the inner and outer

rings affects both frequencies. Later on, a parametric study will
be presented in Section IV.
III. CIRCUIT MODEL
An equivalent circuital model of the antenna is now pre-
sented. The proposed model is as shown in Fig. 4 (based on
the ones presented in [5], [21]) and it is intended to qualita-
tively show the operation of the antenna. Firstly, and
correspond to the typical equivalent circuit of a transmission
line. These two elements are shunt connected to the antenna

substrate thickness affects PIFA antennas due to the similar
grounded connection.
Figs. 9 and 10 show the influences of the gap of the splits in
the rings and the width of the strips . In studying the latter, the
outer radii of both rings remain fixed as the inner ones are varied.
Modifications of both parameters introduce changes in the se-
ries capacitances as well as the shunt inductance. Thus, varia-
tions in the operation frequency are obtained. However, these
variations are not as strong as the ones arising from the other
parameters studied before. Consequently, the gap size and strip
width are ineffective parameters for adjusting the operation fre-
quency through a wide range, but they can help in fine tuning
the band in a small range if it is required. Future works on this
fact open the possibilities of broadband and reconfigurable an-
tennas by connecting lumped elements in between the gaps.
Another aspect to be investigated are the positions of the
grounded vias attached to the rings. Thus far, it has been

assumed that the grounding via of the external ring is situated
above the gap, whereas that of the internal ring is located below
its gap (as depicted in Fig. 1). However, it is also possible to
place the pins of both inner and outer rings simultaneously
above or below their respective gaps. This modification of the
pin location produces a change in the operation frequency of
the bands as can be seen in Fig. 11, which shows a comparison
between two designs: one being the previous placement in op-
posite sense, and the other with both pins placed above the gaps
of the rings which they are grounding. When the placement of
both grounded vias are of the same sense, i.e., above the gap,
the operation frequency of the lower band decreases whereas
that of the upper band increases. As a result, the bands get
more separated. Therefore, the location of the pins provides an
alternative for more flexibility in the design of the bands.
Finally, the distance between the SSRs and the microstrip
line ( in Fig. 1), must be small in order to excite the struc-
ture. This separation changes the matching of the antenna but the

Considering that the relative 3 dB bandwidth of the antenna
is 6.3% for the higher operation band, and 0.9% for the lower
band; the Q factor of both bands is 15.82 and 112.94, respec-
tively. The practical limitation of antennas in terms of size,
bandwidth and efficiency comes from the Chu Limit [29], that
has been reviewed by some authors [30], [31]. The lower bound
of Q factor has the following expression:

where is the radiation efficiency of the antenna. For the eval-
uation of this limit, the size of the antenna is expressed in terms
of (where , and is the minimum radius of
a sphere in which the antenna including its ground plane can
be contained). Therefore, according to the Chu Limit, for two
antennas with same electrical size the one which provides the
lowest band of operation can achieve smaller values of radia-
tion efficiency (for the same bandwidth). In our case,

tenna but also by its thickness.2 For the lower band this term is
equal to and for the upper one . There-
fore, for the lower band, the lower bound is and
the Q factor of the antenna is almost 10 times this bound, whilst
for the upper band, this lower bound is and the Q
factor of the antenna is 3 times the lower bound. As reported in
[31], planar antennas cannot approach this lower bound.
Finally, Fig. 15 shows the measured radiation patterns for the
operation bands in an anechoic chamber. The component is
seen to be stronger for most observation directions, although the
component is generally non-negligible.

VI. DISCUSSION
After the complete analysis of the proposed antenna, we need
to point out what are the main advantages/differences of this
design when compared to the many antennas that can be found
in the literature with similar properties.
Although there had been reported prior studies on PIFA re-
lated types of antennas, there still remain major differences be-
tween those works and the present one. The following is a com-
parison with some of the most relevant works:
In the paper of [32], the antenna there was claimed to have ef-
ficiencies of about 40% and 62% in the lower and upper bands
respectively, as compared to 50% and 80% achieved by the
present design. Although higher gains were obtained in this [32]
(1.62 and 2.13 dB in the bands, compared to and dB in
this work), one has to consider the considerably larger ground
plane (0.76 0.24 at 900 MHz) there as compared to (0.09
0.07 at 1.24 GHz) here. The present concentric twin-SRR
configuration is far more compact, not taking up space of other
displaced locations. Each of the two rings serves one band, a
mechanism that is inherently different from that of [32]. An-
other limitation of the antenna there is its non-coplanar nature
as opposed to the herein clean structure which has a gap that
allows the use of capacitive lumped elements for tuning or re-
configurability purposes.
The work in [33] also dealt with miniaturized dual-band PIFA
antennas. Although a dielectric slab with higher permittivity
was used there ( versus 2.2 here), the antenna which we
propose is still electrically smaller. Besides, that paper made use
of a larger ground plane, which moreover, is not located below
the metallization, thus not qualifying the configuration there as
a patch-type antenna. Considering the fact that the gain in [33]
is in the same order as what we have achieved, it is implied that
the efficiency there is lower since the directivity is higher. As
a consequence, the radiation patterns which we obtain are more
omni-directional than those in that work. Nonetheless, while the
present design appears to outperform the one in [33], the an-
tennas are after all of different topologies and a completely fair
comparison may not be possible.
Amongst the most cited papers on PIFA is that of [34], being
one of the first reports on dual-band PIFAs. As interesting and
pioneering a work as it was during that time, that work how-
ever, though understandably, did not venture into the study of
stretching this antenna to its limits. Firstly, the PIFA size there
is large, being 0.156 along the largest dimension at the lower
band, as opposed by a corresponding value of 0.05 in the
present paper. The bandwidth there, as in this paper, is modest
due to the thin substrate; nonetheless bandwidths in both works
are on par with each other. No information about the gain or di-
rectivity was provided there though, whereas we have presented
such results here. In addition, the radiation patterns of our design
are comparable to those in that [34] (compare Fig. 5 there with
Fig. 15 here), thus strengthening the credibility of the present
work.
Another related work may be found in [35], in which a bigger
ground plane than the one considered here was used. Even dis-
counting this, the size of that PIFA itself is still larger. More-
over, the radiation patterns there are less omni-directional than

Abstract—In this paper, a new method for increasing the total 
efficiency of a dual band compact antenna which usually has low 
values is presented. A newly-devised modified version of the SRR 
(Split Ring Resonator) is used to create another band with a 
higher total efficiency compared to those of the two bands and 
establish a configurable shift mechanism so as to merge it with 
the lower band of the original dual band. Not only does the total 
efficiency of the lower band of the dual band improved, the 
bandwidth also gets wider by this method. The size of the 
antenna we proposed is just ӳ0/8ʳͪʳӳ0/8 for the lower operation 
frequency even with low permittivity material ʻİr = 2.2) as 
substrates. The simulation results of s-parameters and total 
efficiency are provided.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays in antenna design, apart from the requirement 
for wideband and high total efficiency, miniaturization is also 
an important aspect for consideration. To make an antenna 
compact is not that difficult, and so is creating one with high 
total efficiency, but to devise an antenna that possesses all 
these advantages will be a great challenge.  
So far, most of the studies presented in the literature on 
dual band compact antennas did not mention the values of the 
total efficiency [1] at low operation frequencies (fІ2GHz) as 
they were mostly small. In this paper, we propose a novel and 
simple configurable multi-band compact microstrip antenna 
based on a newly-invented modification of the SRR (Split 
Ring Resonator) and a metallic spiral to demonstrate our 
method for improving the total efficiency: by merging two 
operation frequencies to increase the total efficiency of the 
lower band without using any lumped elements. The design 
considered herein is inspired by the antenna studied in [2], for 
which we aim to increase the efficiency by changing the inner 
SRR there to a spiral here. We prefer using total efficiency to 
radiation efficiency here, because if the reflection efficiency  
(being 1 – |S11|2) is low due to high return loss (|S11|), then the 
power will still not get emitted well even if the radiation 
efficiency is high. So it will be better to observe the total 
efficiency, being the true performance indicator of an antenna. 
The proposed antenna is shown in Fig. 1 and the dimensions 
will be provided in the next section. 
At first, we use a spiral to create a dual band antenna, and 
as an important fact, a pin is added to short-circuit the spiral to 
the ground plane so as to obtain compactness. In addition to 
miniaturization, another reason for choosing the spiral is 
because as compared to other complicated structures [3] which 
also have dual band performance, it is much simpler to 
manufacture and of higher elegance. There are many ways to 
create a dual band compact antenna in the literature, but many 
of them use materials of high permittivities as substrates which 
cause low radiation efficiencies ([1], [4]). In this paper, we 
propose an antenna that is compact even with materials of low 
dielectric constants. 
After creating the dual band performance of the shorted 
spiral, we use the SRR to create another band which has a 
higher total efficiency than those of the spiral-attributed bands 
and use it to merge with the lower of the two bands established 
by the spiral towards the aim of increasing the total efficiency. 
The lower band of the metallic spiral is chosen for the merging 
in expectation of miniaturization.  
The manufacture of the antenna is still in progress, so the 
figures in this paper are all simulation results, and all the 
simulations were carried out using CST Microwave Studio.

    Fig. 4 presents 2D color plots of the electric field 
distribution from the top view at three selected frequencies (a) 
1.78GHz, (b) 1.97GHz, and (c) 2.64GHz. It is clear that the 
spiral contributes to the excitation of the lower operation 
frequency at 1.78GHz whereas the middle operation 
frequency at 1.97GHz is attributed to the SRR, and the higher 
operation frequency at 2.64GHz is excited by both the spiral 
and SRR. 
   Fig. 5(a) shows the shift of the middle operation frequency 
as we adjust the length k (see Fig. 2c) of the metallic strip-
stubs on the SRR radiation layer, with the two operation 
bands due to the spiral remaining unaffected. As the value of k 
gets larger, the middle operation frequency approaches the 
lower band, and they overlap when k is 3.2. This is the 
phenomenon we sought because we want to raise the total 
efficiency of the antenna without changing its application. It 
means the antenna will still work at the original frequency but 
with a higher total efficiency. Another advantage is clearer 
shown in Fig. 5(b) being a zoomed-in view of the lower band, 
in which the bandwidth after the merger is seen to be wider 
compared to the initial condition. In this case, the bandwidth 
is 0.67% when k is 0, and it improves to 2.55% when k is 3.05. 
As it is of specific interest, the –10dB operation range of the 
initial lower band (k = 0) is stated to be from 1.785GHz to 
1.795GHz.

For the most part, what we are concerned about is still the 
total efficiency. Table 1 shows the values of the total 
efficiency at 1.78 GHz (the lower band) for different values of 
k. From the table, we can see that the total efficiency increases 
with rising values of k. The distributions of the total efficiency 
are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that not only does the 
highest value of the total efficiency improves, the efficiency 
bandwidth (defined simply as the width of the band at a certain 
efficiency) also gets wider as the two operation frequencies get 
closer. The highest total efficiency in the operation band is 
improved from 19.4% (for k = 0) to 41.21% (for k = 3.05).

Abstract—A compact planar microstrip antenna capable of 
providing tunable dual bands, broader bandwidths, and higher 
efficiencies is proposed. It is composed of a split ring resonator 
(SRR) etched on a topmost dielectric slab, together with a 
metallic spiral printed on a middle slab beneath and shorted via a 
pin to the metal ground plane. This pin drills through a bottom 
dielectric layer on which a feed line comprising a rectangular 
microstrip and a meander line for matching is printed. We seek 
to merge two resonances so as to expand the bandwidth (–10dB), 
and increase the radiation efficiency. The designed antenna is of 
size 0.11Ȝo along each side or 0.18 dielectric wavelength (İr = 2.2). 
The achieved efficiency is 55% at 1.7GHz, and the bandwidth is 
more than double that of the single band counterpart.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Compact antennas are very required in today's 
communication systems. Typical difficulties encountered when 
designing compact antennas include narrow bandwidth and low 
radiation efficiency [1] [2]. Transmission line metamaterials 
(TL-MTM) provide a way to expand the bandwidth and obtain 
good radiation efficiency performance [3]. The advantages of 
the split ring resonator (SRR) are its small electrical size at 
resonance, absence of magnetoelectric coupling, and easy 
fabrication. The investigations herein are thus based on the 
SRR to design compact antennas. Using lumped elements with 
SRRs also provides a way to achieve both compactness and 
improved radiation efficiency while still being simple in 
structure [4]. However, TL-MTM designs usually produce 
complex geometries, and the use of lumped elements 
encounters the risk of device breakdown. In this 
communication, we present a new compact microstrip patch 
antenna design without engaging lumped elements and which 
enjoys structural simplicity. It entails a novel type of spiral and 
an outer square-type SRR. A specially-tailored meander-type 
microstrip feed-line is also devised. This design not only 
provides tunable dual bands, but also achieves a single band 
with broader bandwidth or higher radiation efficiency. 
II. ANTENNA  DESIGN PROCESS 
A. Tunable Dual Band  
 The geometry of the antenna is shown in Fig. 1 (top and 
side views). A polypropylene substrate (İr = 2.2, loss tangent = 
0.0002 at 1MHz) is used for both layers. On the lower slab 
rests the feed line while a square-type SRR with a metallic 
circular-type spiral within is printed on the upper layer. This 
inner spiral is shorted to the ground plane via a metallic pin but 
not the outer SRR. The feed-line comprises a usual rectangular 
microstrip line but with an unusual meandering line branching 
out from one of its side, as shown in Fig. 1. The parameters are 
given in Table 1. This structure produces two resonances, f01 = 
1.68GHz contributed by the spiral and another resonance 
frequency, f02 attributed to the outer ring. As Fig. 2 shows, two 
resonances radiate independently by setting a sufficiently large 
separation distance between the outer ring and the inner spiral 
to reduce mutual coupling, e.g. R = 6.4mm. Therefore, one 
resonance can shift while the other stays fixed. 
As shown in Fig. 3(a), by varying the size of the outer ring 
(via the side-length a = 2R) but with a fixed spiral size the 
higher frequency fo2 can shift without affecting fo1, i.e. it 
remains unchanged. Similarly, changing the scale of the spiral 
with respect to a fixed-size SRR also produces the same 
phenomenon. Another way is to move fo2 but keeping fo1 still is 
to vary the gap-size g of the outer SRR, as demonstrated by Fig. 
3(b). Hence, we have found tuning mechanisms for moving the 
upper band towards the lower one, which is kept unmoved. As 
the difference Ϧf =|fo1 – fo2| between them gets small enough 
such that the two resonances merge into a single band, the 
resultant –10dB bandwidth is more than double that of the 
single band before.

    Meander lines are popular in compact antenna design for 
achieving both inductive effects and reduced areas. This latter 
characteristic can suppress ohmic losses and thus improve the 
radiation efficiency. An equivalent circuit model for the 
antenna is given in Fig. 4(b). The inductance Lm is contributed 
by the meander line to match the capacitive input impedance.   
Cs and Rs are equivalent lumped elements for representing the 
source and feed-line. Cd1 is contributed by the dielectric slabs 
which separate the metallizations on the various layers. Cd3 is 
the capacitance between the spiral and split ring. The other 
elements: Lp1, Cp1, Rp1, Lp2, Cp2, and Rp2 are equivalent circuit 
elements for modeling the shorted spiral and split ring. The 
match result is given in Fig. 4(c).

C. Increase Radiation Efficiency 
Generally, the radiation efficiency is inversely related to the 
antenna electrical size, thus posing a problem at low 
frequencies. This shall be addressed in this section. As the two 
resonances get closer to each other, the radiation efficiency of 
the lower band increases, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Here, the lower 
band f01 is fixed while the upper frequency f02 is shifted towards. 
The increase in the efficiency at f01 is about 150% (10.2% to 
30.1%). Therefore, by merging two resonances, we can achieve 
a better radiation efficiency of the low frequency band. Upon 
merging, the maximum radiation efficiency is 55% at 1.7GHz 
and 53% at the operation frequency of 1.69GHz. If the upper 
band is adequately decreased, it can fully coincide with the 
operation frequency of the lower band. However, in this case, 
the total operation bandwidth will be narrower than any single 
band before merging, although the radiation efficiency of the 
antenna can be increased by the effect of the spiral and split 
ring.
