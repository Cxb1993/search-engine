Abstract 
The essence of this two-year project is to study the wall effect on the viscous drag and 
resistive torque of particles (including cells) via generalized dielectrophoresis and microfluidics, 
which can control the motion of particles next to the wall without mechanical suspension. Force 
and torque can be exerted to electric neutral particles via generalized dielectrophoresis without 
direct mechanical contact, and thus the experimental error associated with mechanical suspension

and characterization using generalized dielectrophoresis, and to general two-phase suspension 
flow. The devices developed in the present study can also be applied to measure the electric and 
mechanical properties of various particles of different shapes and rigidity. 
 
Key words: particles, generalized dielectrophoresis, viscous drag, viscous torque, boundary 
effect. 
 
   
(I) Introduction 
 
When a particle is translating and rotating next to a solid surface, it experiences a viscous drag 
and a resistive torque which are different from those in an infinite medium, and is a fluid 
mechanical problem with profound application. Classical results can be found from the texts by 
Clift et al. (1978), Feuiliebois (1989), and Happel and Brenner (1986). In classical fluid 
mechanics experiments, the particle is usually suspended in fluid with some mechanical 
support(s), and thus there always exist experimental errors associated with the support(s). Such 
errors become crucial if the measurements on fluid drag and resistive torque are performed next 
to wall(s). Thus it would be helpful if we can perform experiments without mechanical support. 
One way to make this plausible is to suspend the particle with dielectrophoretic force through the 
application of a designed electric field. Furthermore, the particle can also be actuated using the 
dielectrophoretic force and torque without direct physical contact. We will apply the 
dielectrophoretic force and torque in this project to drive particle motion in the vicinity of wall(s). 
When a particle with finite conductivity and permittivity is immersed in a liquid with different 
conductivity and permittivity, it may experience a force and a torque associated with the 
polarization effect when it is subject to an electric field. If the field (either dc or ac) is spatially 
non-uniform such as the radial field set up between the rod-like and tubular electrodes shown in 
Figure 1a, the particle moves up the gradient of the mean square of the field magnitude (i.e., 
along the negative r-direction) if  rK   is positive, or vice versa if  rK   is negative; and 
the motion was defined as “dielectrophoresis” by Pohl (1951). Here  rK   is the real part of 
the Clausius-Mossotti factor,  *K  , defined as  
 
6 
 
the viscous resistive torque, and the particle rotates at a constant angular speed. It was found that 
the electrorotation spectrum (the variation of the angular speed with the applied electric 
frequency) varies for different particles in different medium; even the sense of rotation may vary. 
The electrorotation spectrum could be served as a finger print for different cells, and thus can be 
employed as a tool for discriminating different cells, say, for example, healthy and cancer cells. 
By incorporating with certain models of the cell structures, the electrorotation test can also be 
employed for characterizing the particle and cell properties, such as the capacitance and 
conductance of certain cells. Related studies can be found from Gimsa et al. (1994, 1996), Archer 
et al. (1999), Wang et al. (1994b), Yang et al. (1999) and Pethig et al. 2005). In order to avoid 
electrolysis, we usually employ ac field at several voltages (less than 10 volts

manipulation by Voldman (2006), and the applications of dielectrophoresis for stem cell research 
by Pethig et al. (2010). Electrothermal forces arise as a result of high field intensity in 
microfluidic systems; they may affect the dielectrophoretic manipulation, particularly for cases 
with sub-micron particles at low frequency. Details of the electrothermal forces as well as other 
forces were discussed in Ramos et al. (1998) and Castellanos et al. (2003). 
Although gDEP has been applied successfully in many engineering and biomedical 
applications, most of its theory was derived for a single particle in an unbounded liquid medium. 
As many of the particle (and cell) manipulation are performed next to wall(s) in microfluidic 
devices, it is of importance to quantify the effect of wall(s) on gDEP. We may have more accurate 
simulation and better design on the particle/cell manipulation if analytical expressions for 
dielectrophoretic force and torque subject to wall effects are available. Although classical results 
on the theory of particle chains and force interactions between particles were discussed in detail 
in chapters 6 and 7 of Jones (1995), however, the study of particle-wall interaction has not 
received as much attention as that given to particle-particle interactions, as reviewed by Pethig 
(2010). 
In the present project, we need to apply the force and moment balances between gDEP 
force/torque and viscous force/torque in the vicinity of wall(s). Thus we first built up the theory 
of wall effect on gDEP. Then we applied the force and moment balance to study the wall effect on 
viscous drag and resistive torque.  
 
  
(II) Methods, results and discussion 
 
  The results in the subsections (i) and (ii) were published as two papers in Applied Physics 
Letters (Lo and Lei, 2009 and 2010), and the main results are summarized as below. Detailed 
results can be found from those two papers, which were enclosed in the present report as 
Appendix A and B, respectively. The results subsections (iii) and (iv) are still under preparation 
for publication.  
   
 
(i) The theory of wall effect on generalized dielectrophoresis  
 
  We will first discuss the wall effect associated with one infinite flat walls, and then the case 
associated with two parallel walls.

x
wF  and

wF  are forces parallel to the wall, and their 
magnitudes are also of order 1nw F  according to (8c), (8e) and (8f).  
Therefore, 1nwF  is the survival term among all the six wall effect terms in (6), which may 
have the possibility to make significant contribution to the gDEP force. Whether it is indeed 
important depends on its relative magnitude to ( )t F . According to (7a), (7b) and (8c), we

where sE  is the scale of the electric field, EL  is the length scale associated with the field 
variation, and L  is the length scale associated with the phase variation. The wall effect term, 
1n
wF , is significant when the right hand side of (15a) or (15b) is of order unity or higher, i.e., 
/ 1/EL h    or / 1/L h   . As   is always less than 1/8 and of order 210  in common 
applications (say,  =1/64 when the particle is situated at a distance one diameter from the wall), 
it is required that /EL h  and /L h  should be sufficiently large.  
For twDEP application as that in Figure 1c, we may choose / 2L   since / 2  is the 
distance between two electrodes where the positive and negative peak voltages apply. h may be 
chosen as  1.5 / 4 , which is the minimum distance that the particle is conveyed along the 
electrode array in Figure 1c by the twDEP force according to Morgan et al. (2001). It follows that

importance to extend the above theory of wall effect next to a single surface to the case that a 
particle is situated between two infinite parallel walls, with one at y = 0 and one at y = H, as 
sketched in Figure 3a. This can be done by placing infinite numbers of images at appropriate 
positions along a line parallel to the y-axis with px x  and pz z , so that the boundary 
conditions at both walls are satisfied. Here ( , , )p px h z  is the coordinates where the center of the 
particle locates. Some major images are sketched in Figure 3b. Image 1-L and Image 1-U are 
introduced for satisfying the boundary conditions at y  0 and y  H, respectively, in response to 
the effective dipole. However, because of the newly added Image 1-L, the boundary condition at 
y  H cannot be satisfied. Thus we need to add image 2-U. Similarly, the Image 2-L is introduced 
because of the existence of Image 1-U. Finally, we have an infinite number of images along a line 
parallel to the y-axis as shown in Figure 3b. The effect of the image decreases rapidly with its 
distance from the effective dipole to the power of minus three, and thus only the nearby several 
images could provide significant contribution to the gDEP force and torque. Following similar 
procedures as in section 3.1, Lo and Lei [20] found the gDEP force and torque for a spherical 
particle between two infinite parallel walls as

(ii) Validation of the theory of wall effect on generalized dielectrophoreis 
 
The theory of the wall effect on gDEP discussed above can be summarised as follows. All 
the force or torque terms associated with the wall effect are minor in comparing with ( )t F  
or ( )t T , except a force term normal to the wall, F , which is of order  / ( )EL h t  F . 
Here F  stands for 
1n
wF  or 
1
2 walls
n
wF . It follows that: (1) the wall effect could be 
significant only for the DEP force normal to wall when    / 1EL h O   is satisfied, and (2) 
the wall effect is minor for the DEP force parallel to the wall, including both the cDEP and 
twDEP force, and the DEP torque. These imply that when we are manipulating particles next 
to wall(s) using DEP: (i) we may possibly find a normal DEP force, F , whose magnitude 
could be comparable to or even greater than ( )t F , and (ii) The DEP force parallel to the 
wall, F , is approximate the component of ( )t F  parallel to the wall, and thus the DEP 
theory without wall effect can be applied approximately for evaluating F . Therefore, the 
essence of the theory is tested if the above two issues are validated. We had validated the 
theory via studying F  and F  in two simple electric fields, a uniform field and a radial 
field. Both numerical and experimental validations were performed, and discussed as follows. 
 
(a) Numerical validation  
Consider first the device in Figure. 1a. A radial field can be generated within the annular 
region from 1r r  to 2r r  by applying ac voltages 0 cosV t  and 0 cos( )V t   to the 
rod-like and tubular electrodes, respectively, if the upper and lower surfaces at y  0 and H 
are covered with insulated plates. The radial field remains unchanged if radial vertical 
insulated plates are inserted at constant values of  in Figure 1a. Thus a purely radial field can 
be generated within the divergent channel in Figure 4, with all its four side walls (at y 0, y  
H,    and  ) insulated. As the wall effect decays rapidly with distance from the wall 
according to the theory in (17), the channel height, H, in Figure 4 is chosen to be of the same

Equation (24) contains the essential features of the wall effect on DEP. rF r  is the DEP force

Given the instantaneous location of the particle center,  *, *,r h , in Figure 4, we may use 
(24) to calculate each term of the DEP force. The validity of the theory described by (24) was 
checked via numerical calculation using Maxwell stress tensor method as follows. A sphere with 
finite radius R (= 7.5μm) is inserted in the divergent channel (Figure 4) with depth H ( 30 μm) at 
given values of particle location h ( 10, 12.5 and 15 μm) and r (with 
1 2300 700r m r r m     ). Note that the channel height, H, is just twice the particle diameter, 
2R, here. The three-dimensional complex electric potentials were solved for both the sphere and 
its surrounding medium within the channel under appropriate boundary conditions with the aid of 
the software COMSOL. The Maxwell stress tensor (Wang et al., 1997) was then calculated and 
integrated over the sphere surface to obtain the DEP force. Both the case with 0.5rK    
(insulated sphere) and 1rK   (conducted sphere) were studied when 0.iK   Detailed results 
and be found from Appendix A, and some typical result at r  500 m is shown in Table 1 for 
illustration. The dimensionless force magnitudes parallel and normal to the walls,

Consider next the DEP force normal to the wall. The case with h  15 m corresponds to the 
situation that the sphere is on the mid plane of the channel. According to the theory in (24), both 
the upper and lower walls will exerted a repulsive force to the sphere, and thus  0.yF   The 
numerical calculation shows that (calculation) 0yF  . It is not exactly zero because of the 
numerical error, as seen by comparing it with the results at other values of h; it is less than 0.14% 
of all other values in Table 1. For particle not on the mid plane, the discrepancy between 

yF (theory) and yF (calculation) is less than 4% when 0.5rK   , but increases up to 20% when 
1rK  . This may probably due to the fact that distortion of the field in the vicinity of the wall is 
more serious for case with 1rK  . By comparing the numerical values of rF  (approximately 
the cDEP force magnitude in an unbounded medium) and yF  (DEP force solely due to the wall 
effect) in Table 1, yF  is comparable to or even greater than rF .       
It is also interesting to find that although the theory in (24) treats the particle as a point dipole, 
it predicts correctly the resultant force on a finite sphere in a quite restricted area, say, the channel 
contains a sphere with its diameter equals half the channel height. 
 
(b) Experimental validation 
We have also validated our theory via experiments using polystyrene particles in de-ionized 
water, and the detailed result can be found from Appendix B. For the experimental validation, 
first we need to create a field which is simple and possesses analytical expression, so that the 
theoretical DEP force can be evaluated neatly for comparison. Secondly, we need a force balance 
as simple as possible to measure DEP force or its equivalence. The simplicity of the force balance 
relies on the simplicity of the field, which can help to reduce the experimental uncertainty. 
  Consider first the simple field which possesses analytical solution. The radial field generated 
within the flat divergent channel in Figure 4 is a natural choice for experiment. However, it is not 
easy to build the vertical electrodes at 1r r  and 2r r  using conventional MEMS techniques. 
We thus proposed to replace the vertical electrodes by two large electrodes on the bottom surface 
of the channel as shown in Figure 5a. The section from 1r r  to 2r r  is the test section for 
experimental validation, and all its four side walls are insulated. If the electrode area is much 
greater than the cross sectional area of the channel at the inlet and outlet of the test section, or 
equivalently, the channel height, H, is much less than 1r , 2 1r r  and 3 2r r , the field generated 
26 
 
a conventional microscope along the negative y-direction in Figure 5a. However, the 
measurement of h requires a con-focal microscope. We found that the particle moves essentially 
on the mid plane of the channel if the particle diameter is of order of the channel depth, H, based 
on (27b), say, 4H R . They measured U for various cases and used (27a) to validate the theory. 
The agreement is within 8.1%, and thus it is confirmed that the cDEP force in an unbounded 
medium (the left hand side of (27a)) can be employed to predict the cDEP force parallel to the 
wall even when the particle is moving in a channel with its height equals just twice the particle 
diameter. 
Instead of using (27b), we proposed to validate the normal DEP force associated with the wall 
effect in a uniform field (see Appendix B). The uniform field was created approximately in the 
insulated test section (from 0x L  ) of the inclined rectangular channel shown in Figure 5b. 
The field can be set up by applying ac potentials with 180 phase shift to those two large 
electrodes outside the test section, provided the channel height, H, is much less than L and eL , 
the length of the electrodes. The analytical expression for the uniform field was obtained and 
discussed in the Appendix C. The DEP force, ( )t F , is identically zero, under a uniform field, 
and only the normal DEP forces, 1
2 walls
n
wF  in (21a) or 
1n
wF  in (16a), and some higher order 
terms survive. The experiment (see Appendix B) was based on the force balance between the 
normal DEP forces associated with three walls (at y  0, y  H and z  0 of Figure 5b) and the 
buoyancy. The channel width w is much greater than the channel height H so that the other wall at 
y  w is irrelevant. As the channel is tilted, the force balance takes place along both the y and 
z-directions in Figure 5b. For the present case with insulated walls, the particle is expelled away 
from the wall by the normal DEP force. Consider first the force balance along the y-direction. The 
channel height, H, was designed to be about twice the particle diameter, so that the normal DEP 
force associated with the walls at y  0 and H dominates the buoyancy. Such a normal DEP force 
associated with two parallel walls was employed to keep the particle remains to move on a 
parallel plane y  h, which is slightly below the mid-plane of the channel at y  H/2. The normal 
DEP force along the z-direction pushes the particle away from the wall at z  0 until it reaches a

(iii) The wall effect on the viscous drag 
 
 The viscous drag on a spherical particle with radius R in an infinite fluid with viscosity μ 
follows the Stokes drag law (See Happel and brenner, 1986, or any standard fluid mechanics text 
book) as follows: 
 
, 6 ,                        (28)f R  F U                                                          
 
where U is the velocity of the particle relative to the fluid at the center of the sphere. When the 
sphere is moving near a wall, the above equation in an infinite fluid domain should be modified. 
For a sphere moving parallel to a single stationary wall, Faxen (1921) derived the viscous drag 
using the method of image as (see Happel and Brenner, 1986)

where h is the distance from the particle center to the wall along the normal direction. Goldman et

 When a sphere is moving parallel to two stationary parallel walls with spacing H, through an

where dC  is the wall effect coefficient for the Stokes drag law. It is in general a function of h/H 
and R/h. Faxen (1925) obtained an approximate analytical expression for dC  (see page 325 of 
Happel and Brenner, 1986), but its detailed numerical result needs numerical calculation. 
However, when h/H 0.25 and 0.5, there are closed form expressions as follows (see Happel and

y-direction) the displacement history of a given particle in the divergent channel of Figure 4a, 
provided that the particle is moving essentially on a plane parallel to the wall(s). We invoked the 
normal DEP force to keep the particle move essentially on the mid plane of the channel by 
choosing the channel height close to the particle diameter. We have carried out experiments using 
polystyrene particles with 2R = 15m in DI (de-ionized water) and other medium (such as RPMI 
solution). Figure 6 shows four tests with different combinations for two channel heights (H) and 
two electric frequencies (f). Table 2 compares the experiment and the theory via the wall effect 
coefficient, dC , of the Stokes’ drag.

equation (27a). The discrepancies are within 8.1%, which implies that equation (30) is adequate 
for the particle manipulation in micro-devices.

and insulated wall condition, and are appropriate for the electrorotation chamber in Figure 1b. 
Note that the factor / 3a bS S  in (36a) is of order unity. The viscous resistive torque is that in 
equation (34), with z Ω  . 
  The electrodes in the electrorotation chamber shown in Figure 1b is of rectangular shape. It can 
be of different shapes, for example, a shape described by a polynominals, or others, in practical 
applications. In the present study, both rectangular and polynominal electrodes have been studied 
numerically. The latter was also applied for experiments.  
In the calculation, the complex electric potentials were first solved within the chamber subject 
to the appropriate boundary conditions. We then calculate the electric field, and then the DEP 
force and torque as discussed earlier in this report. For the experiment, the chamber in Figure 1b 
was fabricated using standard MEMS techniques, but with polynominal electrodes. Red blood 
cells and other cells were carried out for experiments. The applied frequency is from 1-10MHz, 
and the applied voltage is of order of 10 volts, with a 90 phase shift between neighboring 
electrodes.  
When a negative DEP particle is introduced into the electrorotation chamber, the cDEP force 
pushes the particle toward the central part of the chamber, while the twDEP force drives the 
particle in circular motion around the z-axis. As the particle moves, it also rotates about one of its 
34 
 
optimized value is different for a 3D chamber. For a 3D chamber as that shown in Figure 7, we 
first need to determine the elevation ( pH ) where the particle settles. pH  is the value of h on the 
centerline of the chamber where the particle reaches force balance. At ,pz h H   the upward 
cDEP force is balanced by the downward buoyancy. Figure 8 shows the numerical prediction of 
pH  for a typical case of erythrocyte in saline water using oblate spheroid model (calculated 
using the theory in Yang and Lei, 2007) at 5 peak-to-peak volt and 6 MHz. Here we set 
0.054,i iK K   0.447,rK    0.166iK    and / 0.5cw L  。Figure 9 shows the distribution 
of total DEP force and normalized DEP torque in an area equals c cL L at .pz h H  According 
to the force distribution on the left column, it is found that the particle can be trapped for cases 
with 40 μmH    and 50 μm . However, the case with 40 μmH   possesses a larger region of 
uniform DEP torque and higher value of DEP torque (see the figures on the right column), and is 
thus a better design.  
 
Figure 8: The z-component total DEP force (equals cDEP force here) along the central axis of the 
electrorotation chamber for different channel heights (30, 40, 50 and 100 m). The 
horizontal line represents the magnitude of the buoyancy. Each curve is intersected by 
the horizontal line twice; the intersection at higher z is a stable location, and is the value 
of pH .  
36 
 
  Given the electrode shapes and geometries of an electrorotation chamber, we first solve 
numerically for its detailed complex potentials, and then the field. For a given particle in the 
known field, we calculate its equilibrium position using force balance. Once we know the particle 
location, we can calculate the DEP torque using (36a), and then check the viscous resistive torque 
using (36), or evaluate the wall effect coefficient fK  in (35). Figure 10 shows a typical result 
using erythrocyte as the test particle. The theoretical prediction agrees nicely with the experiment. 
It is also found that the electrode shape is not a crucial parameter for electrorotation. 
  We have also studied the problem with different particles and cells in different electrorotation 
chambers at different operation conditions, and the results will be summarized in a paper under 
preparation.
