The proposed protocol can rapidly seek out the target vehicle without plenty of overheads and 
efficiently deliver packets with high reliability.               
As a source vehicle wants to transmit a message to the target vehicle, it usually floods the message 
into the network because of the lack of the position of the target vehicle. The message would be 
broadcasted hop by hop till the target vehicle receives it or its lifetime is due. This would cause many 
serious broadcast storms especially in the networks with plenty of users and large topologies, such as 
metropolitan environments. Furthermore, transmitting messages by flooding would result in very 
long delays. Many messages with time constraint, like safety information, cannot be received in time. 
Therefore, the position of the target vehicle is an essential information for a routing protocol. In 
VANET, the high mobility of vehicles makes it very difficult to acquire the actual position of the 
target vehicle. Many existed works claim that the position of a vehicle can be obtain with the aid of 
global positioning system (GPS). However, it would cause many security problems and invade 
personal privacies. Thus no system would provide the service of querying positions of other people. 
Even the position of the target vehicle can be obtained by querying the GPS, it is still impossible to 
query the position of the target vehicle which might be quickly moving hop by hop. Once the target 
vehicle leaves, another routing calculation should be issued and more resources would be wasted. 
Thus, how to update the position of the target vehicle and rectify the route during transmission is 
important for a novel routing protocol in VANETs. One of the main goals of this project is proposing 
a novel routing protocol suited for VANETs. This protocol can pursue the target vehicle 
automatically in compliance with its moving trajectory without route recalculation during 
transmission. This protocol can seek the target vehicle out without the aid of GPS by maintaining a 
table of passed vehicles in each road segment. The GPS is only used to obtain the position of the 
source vehicle itself. It is more conformable to the application of GPS nowadays. The proposed 
protocol can significantly improve the transmission delay and reduce the control overheads. 
Therefore, more services with time constraint can be supported in VANET and less broadcast storms 
would be caused.  
The other main goal of this project is designing a reliable transmission protocol for VANET. We 
draw support from the predictability of the mobility patterns of public transportation systems such as 
buses to realize this purpose. Packets can be transmitted by switching between common vehicles and 
buses so that routes would be more feasible and scalable. The transmission protocol can greatly 
improve the reliability of transmitting packets in VANET. 
Among the existed routing protocols, position based algorithms find out the target vehicle by 
querying the GPS. Greedy forwarding algorithm [1] is one of typical position based algorithms. As 
receiving a packet, the vehicle would consider whether it should relay this packet or not. If its 
position is nearer the target vehicle than the position of the previous forwarding vehicle, it would 
transmit this packet to its neighbor who is nearest to the target vehicle. On the contrary, if its position 
is farther the target vehicle than the position of the previous forwarding vehicle, it would discard the 
5 
 
 
[6] proposes a routing protocol named position-based bus relay protocol (PBR) which 
transmitting packets only by vehicles of public transportation systems such as buses. It benefits from 
the regularity of buses to improve the packet delivery ratio in metropolitan environments. However, 
transmitting packets only by buses would debase the scalability of the routing protocol. It is only 
suited for the metropolises which have very developed and tight transportation systems.  
The routing algorithm mentioned above need GPS to find out target vehicles. Once the target 
vehicle leaves, another routing calculation should be issued and more resources would be wasted. 
Transmission delays would be very long when target vehicle is moving with high speed. 
 
1.2 Proposed Scheme 
 
In this section, we will introduce the proposed footmark leaving scheme and the bus-assisted 
transmission algorithm. The proposed footmark leaving scheme can seek the target vehicle out 
without the aid of GPS by maintaining a table of passed vehicles in each road segment. It 
significantly improves the transmission delay and reduces the control overheads. Therefore, more 
services with time constraint can be supported in VANET and less broadcast storms would be caused. 
The bus-assisted transmission algorithm benefits from the predictability of the mobility patterns of 
public transportation systems to improve the probability of successful transmitting packets to the 
targets. Packets can be transmitted by switching between common vehicles and buses so that routes 
would be more feasible and scalable. 
At the beginning, we make three assumptions to construct the whole scenario of our work.  
 
(1) Each vehicle equips the GPS. The GPS is only used to obtain the position of the vehicle itself 
rather than the position of target vehicles. It is more secure and conformable to the application 
of GPS nowadays.  
(2) Each vehicle adopts the same network protocol stack such as IEEE 802.11p and has the same 
transmission rage. 
(3) Each vehicle have the whole road topology of the city with the aid of the digital map.  
 
We would emphasize that these three assumptions are very reasonable and conformable to the real 
world. 
1.2.1 The Footmark Leaving Scheme 
In general, before transmitting data to the target vehicle, a source vehicle should issue a RREQ 
message to find out the target vehicle. RREQ message would be broadcasted hop by hop till the 
target vehicle receives or its lifetime expires. It will cause serious broadcast storms and consume 
huge transmission resources. Even RREQ reaches the target vehicle and a route between source and 
target vehicle is calculated after source vehicle receives the RREP message, the route would break 
7 
 
packets by switching between common vehicles and buses to improve the reliability of transmission.  
The proposed bus-assisted transmission protocol instead of PBR, would transmit packets to 
target vehicles by common vehicles and buses. When a bus receives a packet, it compares its driving 
path with the trajectory of the target vehicle which can be obtain by issuing a RREQ to the target 
vehicle with the aid of the proposed footmark leaving scheme illustrated in section 3.1. The bus 
calculates the conformable road segment of its driving path and the trajectory of the target vehicle 
which is nearest to the target vehicle and estimates the delay time of carrying the packet to this 
conformable road segment according to its velocity. If the delay time is small than the remaining 
lifetime of the packet, it carries the packet to this conformable road segment and then broadcasts it 
into the road segment. If the delay time is large than the remaining lifetime of the packet, it must find 
out the nearest road segment to the target vehicle where it can carry the packet to before the lifetime 
of the packet is due. Then the bus carries the packets to the road segment and broadcasts it.  
 
Figure 3. The flow chart of the footmark leaving scheme 
 
 In the proposed protocol, packets will be transmitted by common vehicles and buses 
simultaneously. A packet carried by a bus can then be forwarded by common vehicles after the bus 
carries it to the appropriate road segment and rebroadcasts it. The predictability and regularity of 
buses can prevent packets from loss until reaching the appropriate conformable road segments. 
Therefore, the proposed protocol can significantly improve the probability of successful transmission. 
Compared to PBR, we allow common vehicles to forward packets instead of buses only so that the 
9 
 
First, we pay our attention to the packet delivery ratio, the important index of a routing protocol. 
Figure 5 shows the simulation results of the environment with low vehicle density (50 vehicles). The 
proposed bus-assisted transmission protocol with the footmark leaving scheme (blue line) gains the 
best packet delivery ratio compared with CLA-S and PBR. Even only adopting the footmark leaving 
scheme, the performance is also better than CLA-S and PBR when the average velocity of vehicles is 
high. CLA-S gets lower packet delivery ratio because of the irregular road arrangement which is 
harmful to establish forwarding zones.  
The performance of the packet delivery ratio as the density of vehicles is high (250 vehicles) is 
shown as Figure 6. We can see that regardless of whether the bus-assisted transmission protocol is 
adopted,   our proposed schemes can have better packet delivery ratio than CLA-S and PBR for all 
average velocity of vehicles.  
Second, we investigate the performance of the end-to-end delay and depict the results in Figure 7. 
It shows that both our proposed schemes can have shorter average end-to-end delay. PBR gets the 
longest average delay because that it is dominated by the average velocity of buses. Store and 
forward behavior in PBR causes longer delay than other schemes. CLA-S and our proposed schemes 
can benefit from transmitting packets via the paths constructed of common vehicles so that the 
average delay is shorter. The reason that both of our schemes can be better than CLA-S in terms of 
average delay is that the proposed footmark leaving scheme can quickly seek out the target vehicles 
regardless of the mobility of target vehicles.  
 At last we calculate the total control overheads of CLA-S, PBR and our schemes to see how 
many costs must pay in each scheme.

2 CHANNEL CAPACITY ESTIMATION AND QUEUE MANAGEMENT SCHEME FOR 
VANET  
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
Aimed at transportation safety and value-added services, telematics have received increasing 
attention in recent years. As its name implied, telematics is the integrations and the applications of 
information technologies and communication technologies to vehicles and transportation systems. 
Although, both fields are well-developed by themselves, there still exist great challenges in 
combining these technologies to the realm of vehicular communications. 
High mobility is an essential characteristic in vehicular communication systems, and also the 
primary cause of challenges. Existing solutions for wireless communication become ineffective or 
even infeasible in such highly dynamic network topologies. Although there has been a new standard: 
IEEE 802.11p designed for vehicular communications, it is still a challenge to capture the current 
network status and instantly regulate transmission behavior. 
To these problems, this project will contribute to vehicular communication to develop a novel 
queue management scheme for public transportation systems such as buses, shuttles. The moving 
patterns of vehicles of public transportation systems are quite different from the others. They would 
regularly and periodically move on fixed routes and pass through each segment of their whole routes 
several times a day. This characteristic is very important to make it more feasible to capture network 
conditions in advance when vehicles are moving with high speeds.  
Based on the characteristic mentioned above, the primary concern of this paper is the dynamic 
bandwidth estimation and dynamic queue management for public transportation systems. Available 
bandwidth is a scarce resource for wireless communications, particularly in highly dynamic, public 
transportation systems. There are multiple end-users with different QoS requirements on the same 
moving vehicle. It is critical to make best use of limited bandwidth to differentiate and to 
13 
 
time-varying, unstable, and unreliable. Therefore, the channel status of the only one wireless link 
would significantly affect the quality of the whole connection in terms of delay time, packet loss rate, 
etc. On the contrary, the delay times of wired links can be regarded as constant, and packet loss rates 
of wired links are quite small and can be ignored.  
As mentioned above, in order to judge whether a packet would be transmitted in time or not, we 
should first estimate the channel quality of the wireless link between a RSU and an OBU. By 
following the model of additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN) The channel capacity, C, of 
a wireless link could be expressed as equation (1), which is the well-known Shannon–Hartley 
theorem. 
 
?̀? = 𝐵 ∙ 𝑙𝑜𝑔2(1 + 𝑆𝑁)    (1) 
where B is the bandwidth of the channel, S is the power of the received signal and N is the 
power of interference. The ratio of S to N is named signal to interference and noise ratio(SINR). 
By considering the multipath fading, power spectral density, ηsr, and channel gain, Gsr, between a 
sender and a receiver should be introduced into the calculation of SINR. Thus, the formula for SINR 
can be as following: 
 
𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅 = 𝐺𝑠𝑟×𝑃𝑠𝑟
𝜂𝑠𝑟×𝐵    (2) 
For the public transportation systems such as buses and shuttles, vehicles regularly and 
periodically move on fixed routes. They would pass through each segment of their whole routes 
several times a day. In order to predict the available channel capacity of certain segment on the route 
more accurately in advance, we can draw support from the historical SINRs recorded at the same 
segment. To predict the SINR at road segment j, we can refer to the previous k records at segment j. 
The SINR of the road segment j when the bus passes through the segment at the (k+1)th time would 
be: 
𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝑗
𝑘+1 = 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝐴𝑗𝑘 + 𝑎𝑣𝑔�∑ 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝐴𝑗𝑦𝑘𝑦=1 �− 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝐴𝑗𝑘𝑎𝑣𝑔(∑ 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝐴𝑗𝑦𝑘𝑦=1 )    (3) 
Following the equation (2) and (3), we can estimate the channel capacity of segment j , ?̀?𝑗𝑘+1, before 
the (k+1)th pass by equation (4): 
 
?̀?𝑗
𝑘+1 =  𝐵𝑗 × 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 �1 + 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝑗𝑘+1𝛤 �   (4) 
Where is Γ is a parameter determined by the link layer design and channel coding scheme. The 
typical value of Γ is 3.  
Besides considering the historical SNR at the same road segment which is the geographic 
consideration, the time consideration should also be taken into account to reflect the factors 
15 
 
determine the connection duration with the RSU. For a VMR, the connection duration with the RSUj 
is noted as tj and the connection disruption time between communicating with RSUj and RSUj+1 is 
noted as δj. The main goals of our proposed scheme, CAPD, are discarding out-of-date packets in 
advance to give precedence over packets which are urgent and have opportunities to be received in 
time and reducing the number of out-of-date packets during the connection disruption time.  
 The policies of CAPD are minimal lifetime and maximal queue length. We would give more 
precedence over packets with relatively short remaining lifetime or belonging to a relatively long 
user queue. Support that VMR gives each user a unique queue. User would delivery packets into its 
queue in the VMR to wait to be transmit. CAPD sort all user packets in the order of their remaining 
lifetime. The packet with minimal remaining lifetime is in front of the others. If there are two packets 
with the same remaining lifetime, their orders are determined by the lengths of the queues they 
belong to. The packet belonging to the queue with longer queue length gets ahead of the other. 
Support that a superframe contains an uplink sub-frame and a downlink sub-frame, the uplink 
sub-frame with duration Tu goes ahead the downlink sub-frame with duration Td. If VMR has 
established a connection with RSUj and the size of each packet is equal to S, the predictive 
expensing time, ϵj, till this packet attends its destination via RSUj is as (7).  
ϵ𝑗
𝑖 = (𝑇𝑢 + 𝑇𝑑) ×

⎥ + �𝑖  𝑚𝑜𝑑  �𝑇𝑢∙𝐶𝑗

+ 𝑇𝑓   (7) 
However, it is possible that some packets cannot be transmitted during the connection 
duration of RSUj, so the predictive expensing time till a packet attends its destination via RSUj+g 
should be: 
 
ϵ𝑗+𝑔
𝑖 = ∑ (𝑡𝛼 + 𝛿𝛼) + ϵ𝑗+𝑔𝑖∗𝑗+𝑔−1𝛼=𝑗   ,      (8) 
𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒  𝑖∗ = 𝑖 − �� 𝑡𝛽 × 𝐶𝛽𝑗+𝑔−1
𝛽=𝑗
� × 1
𝑆
 
 
Thus, after sorting packets, according to equation (7), CAPD check each packet to see whether 
the packet can be received in time or not. If a packet has chance to be received in time, CAPD puts it 
into a FIFO queue for transmission. Oppositely, CAPD discards it to reserve its transmission 
opportunity to other packets.  
 The proposed scheme, CAPD, can estimate the transmission rate and delay of each RSU in 
advance according to current SNR and historical values. It can early discard out-of-date packets to 
give more opportunities over packets which would be received in time. CAPD also takes the packet 
lifetime into account to transmit urgent packets as soon as possible. Therefore, CAPD can improve 
the bandwidth utilization and reduce the number of out-of-date packets.

3 CONCLUSION 
 
In this project, we propose two schemes to improve the routing performance of VANET: (1) The 
footmark leaving scheme. It can pursue the target vehicle automatically in compliance with its 
moving trajectory without route recalculation and the aid of GPS during transmission. It only 
maintains a table of passed vehicles in each road segment to efficiently seek out target vehicles. (2) 
The bus-assisted transmission protocol. By benefiting from the predictability and regularity of buses, 
packets can be transmitted by switching between common vehicles and buses so that routes would be 
more feasible and scalable. It can greatly improve the reliability of transmitting packets in VANET. 
High mobility is an essential characteristic in vehicular communication systems, and also the 
primary cause of challenges. Existing solutions for wireless communication become ineffective or 
even infeasible in such highly dynamic network topologies. With considering the regular moving 
patterns of public transportation systems such as buses, trains and shuttles, this project focuses on 
vehicular communication and takes geographic and time considerations into account to develop a 
novel queue management scheme for public transportation systems. The primary concern of the 
proposed scheme is the dynamic bandwidth estimation and dynamic queue management for public 
transportation systems. The simulation results are promising and optimistic and can validate the 
contributions of the proposed scheme.
