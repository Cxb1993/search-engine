  
reproduction was firstly developed in this study. It was derived based on the approach suggested by Pattanaik et al. [3, 
4]. It carried out a multiscale representation of the human visual system; and then followed by using an equation similar 
to a photoreceptor adaptation equation, originally proposed by Michaelis-Menten [5, 6]. Moreover, with the 
incorporations of multiscale type adaptation-and-spatial vision model, HDR tone-mapping operator, device 
characterization and gamut mapping models, the module derived would mapped the vast ranges of radiances, found in 
real and synthetic scenes, into the small limited ranges available on conventional display devices of LCD’s and 
printers/presses.  
 
2. COMPUTAIONAL FRAMEWORK OF MODEL  
 
 
Figure 1. The specific computational procedures used to implement each step of the model. 
A HDR imaging module as mentioned earlier, based on a multiscale model of adaptation and spatial vision in human 
visual system, was developed and applied to the problems of realistic tone reproduction across imaging devices. 
Additionally, an adaptive gamut mapping algorithm, incorporated with device characterization models for both Adobe 
RGB and sRGB formats of LCD displays, was also plugged in the computation framework to carry out the optimization 
of HDR image rendering. The adaptive gamut mapping algorithm was implemented using both a bilateral filtering 
technique [7] and a multiple-conversing-points approach [8, 9]. The Adobe RGB format of LCD (EIZO Color Edge 
CG221) was characterized under D65 white point, and used as a soft-proofing platform to display/represent HDR RGB 
images, and also to evaluate rendition-quality of images produced. Moreover, an Un-Sharp Masking (USM), used for 
detail enhancement which was conventional and practically applied in color separation algorithm for graphic arts, was 
carried out in the optimization process of HDR image rendition quality when needed. The specific computational 
procedures that were used to implement each step of the model are described below. A pictorial representation of each 
stage of the model/algorithm applied is presented in Figure 1. 
2.1. Tone Mapping Algorithm  
The reproduction of the visual appearance of original scene is the ultimate goal in the tone mapping. Therefore the tone 
mapping algorithm developed here made use of adaptive and spatial visual model with multi-scale, to provide the 
solution to compress the dynamic range of the HDR image to fit into the display range while preserving details.

attributes differ from the cones. The adapted contrast signals are then passed through contrast transducer functions. 
Different transducer functions are applied to each spatial frequency mechanism to approximate psychophysically 
derived human spatial contrast sensitivity functions. Two-part functions, consisting of two power functions, are chosen 
to replicate the two regions of distinct slope in the transducer functions. Again, the rods use a separate function. After 
the contrast transducers, the rod and cone signals can be combined to produce signals that represent the three-
dimensional color appearances of the input image. 
 
As this point, the output of the visual model consists of appearance signals in an achromatic and two chromatic channels, 
and six spatial band-pass mechanisms plus a low-pass image. These appearance signals can, then, be backward through 
the model to recreate cone signals (that replicate the full color appearance of the image on a photopic/trichromatic 
display device such as a LCD display), and ultimately device signals such as RGB or CMYK. 
 
Of all nonlinear mappings, logarithmic and exponential mappings are among the most straightforward. For medium 
dynamic range images, accommodated by current LDR display devices, these very simple solutions may still be 
competitively with more complex operators. Therefore, in this study, both logarithmic and exponential mapping 
operators were implemented to process luminance mapping using Eqns. 1 and 2 respectively.

Here, ( , )dL x y is the display luminance that is the quantity we wish to display; avL , average luminance; maxL , the 
maximum luminance on image; and ( , )wL x y , image luminance. The logarithm is a compressive function for values 
larger than 1; whereas the exponential mapping operators transforms world luminances to display luminances using the 
exponential function, bound between 0 for black pixels and 1 for infinitely bright pixels. 
2.2. Device Characterization and Gamut Mapping  
Two LCD with standard color space of Adobe RGB and sRGB 9 (both under D65 white point calibration) were used as 
displays of images. The Adobe RGB format of display was used as a soft-proofing platform to display/represent HDR 
RGB images, and also to evaluate both rendition-quality and prediction-performance of modules derived. Moreover, the 
sRGB LCD (EIZO ColorEdge CE240W) was used as LDR display, representing the common available LCD with 
intermediate limit of dynamic range. Therefore, an adaptive gamut mapping algorithm, introduced by Nicolas Bonnier 
et al. [7] mentioned earlier were also implemented in this study. By plugging bilateral filtering with a multiple 
conversing-points approach (Fig. 3), it maps the Adobe RGB image to sRGB images. Additionally, the adaptive GMA 
could also be incorporated with or without an adaptive Un-sharp Masking (USM), to carry out the optimization of HDR 
image rendition.  
 
This adaptive gamut mapping algorithm decomposes the image tested into two bands (see Fig. 4), and can provide 
several available options: 1) re-render Ilow ; 2) rescale and remap its lightness range; and 3) adjust Ihigh using a scaling 
factor; 4) spatially filter or modify image considered using a more complex function [13]; 5) adjust the merging 
function of the two adjusted bands. Fig. 4 shows the adaptive algorithms derived in this study by the following process: 
• Conversion of the original Adobe RGB image to the CIELAB color space: Iin. 
• Decomposition of the CIELAB image into two bands using bilateral filtering (BF): Ilow and Ihigh. 
• Hue-Preserving MinimumΔE clipping [14](HPMinΔE clipping) (3) of the low-pass band Ilow: Ilow.  
[Iout = HPMinΔE (Iin), with Iin the original image and Iout the gamut mapped image.] 
• Adaptive merging of Ilow (4)and Ihigh(5): Iout . 
• Conversion to the sRGB encoding of the output LCD.

function form, as well as the choice of anchor value, has a significant impact on the resulted appearance of images 
produced. Although more experimentations would be needed to obtain definite conclusions, it seems that the value, 
avL  or wL , chosen to anchor the mapping, has the more profound effect on the overall image appearance results.

3.2. Device Characterization and Gamut Mapping 
Eight images in Adobe RGB type (Fig. 6) were used to test the adaptive gamut mapping algorithms (GMAs) derived. 
Three mapping methods, including linear compression, S-shape compression and clipping were considered. Additionally, 
the GMAs were also tested, a) with or without plug-in of the USM filter; b) using or not using adjusted approach (i.e. 
spatial-and-color adaptive clipping/compression), to evaluate the filter rendition performance. The USM considered was 
used in the adjusted type of gamut mapping to compensate the smoothing effect of bilateral filter. In total, 7 GMA 
models were investigated. They are listed in Table 1.  
 
Finally, A set of forced-choice paired comparison psychophysical experiment were carried out, to make comparisons of 
colour appearance matching between the original images (displayed on the Adobe RGB LCD) and the reproduction 
images (displayed on the sRGB LCD). It was used to cross verify the prediction performances of those GMAs derived 
DCMs in question. A panel of 10 observers viewed a paired of reproductions randomly presented, and judged which of 
the two gave a better match (i.e. color fidelity) to an original image in question. The paired comparison results in terms 
of the z-score with 95% confidence limit (CL), for the combined 8 images, were summarized and plotted in Fig. 7. The 
results apparently showed that adjusted linear compression, using with and also without the adapted USM, 
outperformed the others. It implies that the use of both bilateral and USM filters significantly enhances the GMA 
rendering performance in cross-media color reproduction.

impact on the field of digital imaging. Potential application areas include: image quality metrics; image coding and 
compression methods; perceptually-based image synthesis algorithms; image-based rendering.  
 
There is still much work to be done in this area. Future models should integrate multispectral type of device 
characterization models to reduce metamerism problems. A well-performed CIEXYZ type of multi-spectral Standard 
Observer mode was derived previously [2] to optimally reconstruct spectra of HDR scene. The Observer model, 
simulating responses of CIE 1931 color matching functions, was plugged-in a Winner algorithm with basis vectors. 
Those basic vectors used in the Winner algorithm were obtained using singular value decomposition method (SVD) 
which is based on a reflectance dataset of Glossy Munsell Book. A mean ΔE*00 value of 0.22 was found for reconstruct 
performances of the CIEXYZ multispectral Standard Observer model derived, under D65 white-point/illuminant. 
Therefore, via the multi-spectral Observer model, the broadband RGB type of Adobe RGB HDR images can be further 
satisfactorily transformed into the illuminant-independently multi-spectral images. The Adobe RGB type of both 
broadband (i.e. RGB format) and multi-spectral images can be, hence, preferably chosen as broadband and multi-
spectral originals (of HDR scene) respectively for high-rendition imaging applications across media of digital HDR 
cameras, displays and printers/presses considered. Therefore the goal of deriving an illuminant-independent type of 
HDR imaging module can be satisfactorily achieved; and it can be applied to optimally multi-spectrally reconstruct 
every color concerned in high-dynamic-range of original images for preferable cross-media color reproduction 
applications.

real and synthetic scenes, into the small limited ranges available on conventional display devices of LCD’s and 
printers/presses.  
 
2. COMPUTAIONAL FRAMEWORK OF MODEL  
 
 
Figure 1. The specific computational procedures used to implement each step of the model. 
A HDR imaging module as mentioned earlier, based on a multiscale model of adaptation and spatial vision in human 
visual system, was developed and applied to the problems of realistic tone reproduction across imaging devices. 
Additionally, an adaptive gamut mapping algorithm, incorporated with device characterization models for both Adobe 
RGB and sRGB formats of LCD displays, was also plugged in the computation framework to carry out the optimization 
of HDR image rendering. The adaptive gamut mapping algorithm was implemented using both a bilateral filtering 
technique [7] and a multiple-conversing-points approach [8, 9]. The Adobe RGB format of LCD (EIZO Color Edge 
CG221) was characterized under D65 white point, and used as a soft-proofing platform to display/represent HDR RGB 
images, and also to evaluate rendition-quality of images produced. Moreover, an Un-Sharp Masking (USM), used for 
detail enhancement which was conventional and practically applied in color separation algorithm for graphic arts, was 
carried out in the optimization process of HDR image rendition quality when needed. The specific computational 
procedures that were used to implement each step of the model are described below. A pictorial representation of each 
stage of the model/algorithm applied is presented in Figure 1. 
2.1. Tone Mapping Algorithm  
The reproduction of the visual appearance of original scene is the ultimate goal in the tone mapping. Therefore the tone 
mapping algorithm developed here made use of adaptive and spatial visual model with multi-scale, to provide the 
solution to compress the dynamic range of the HDR image to fit into the display range while preserving details.  
attributes differ from the cones. The adapted contrast signals are then passed through contrast transducer functions. 
Different transducer functions are applied to each spatial frequency mechanism to approximate psychophysically 
derived human spatial contrast sensitivity functions. Two-part functions, consisting of two power functions, are chosen 
to replicate the two regions of distinct slope in the transducer functions. Again, the rods use a separate function. After 
the contrast transducers, the rod and cone signals can be combined to produce signals that represent the three-
dimensional color appearances of the input image. 
 
As this point, the output of the visual model consists of appearance signals in an achromatic and two chromatic channels, 
and six spatial band-pass mechanisms plus a low-pass image. These appearance signals can, then, be backward through 
the model to recreate cone signals (that replicate the full color appearance of the image on a photopic/trichromatic 
display device such as a LCD display), and ultimately device signals such as RGB or CMYK. 
 
Of all nonlinear mappings, logarithmic and exponential mappings are among the most straightforward. For medium 
dynamic range images, accommodated by current LDR display devices, these very simple solutions may still be 
competitively with more complex operators. Therefore, in this study, both logarithmic and exponential mapping 
operators were implemented to process luminance mapping using Eqns. 1 and 2 respectively.

Here, ( , )dL x y is the display luminance that is the quantity we wish to display; avL , average luminance; maxL , the 
maximum luminance on image; and ( , )wL x y , image luminance. The logarithm is a compressive function for values 
larger than 1; whereas the exponential mapping operators transforms world luminances to display luminances using the 
exponential function, bound between 0 for black pixels and 1 for infinitely bright pixels. 
2.2. Device Characterization and Gamut Mapping  
Two LCD with standard color space of Adobe RGB and sRGB 9 (both under D65 white point calibration) were used as 
displays of images. The Adobe RGB format of display was used as a soft-proofing platform to display/represent HDR 
RGB images, and also to evaluate both rendition-quality and prediction-performance of modules derived. Moreover, the 
sRGB LCD (EIZO ColorEdge CE240W) was used as LDR display, representing the common available LCD with 
intermediate limit of dynamic range. Therefore, an adaptive gamut mapping algorithm, introduced by Nicolas Bonnier 
et al. [7] mentioned earlier were also implemented in this study. By plugging bilateral filtering with a multiple 
conversing-points approach (Fig. 3), it maps the Adobe RGB image to sRGB images. Additionally, the adaptive GMA 
could also be incorporated with or without an adaptive Un-sharp Masking (USM), to carry out the optimization of HDR 
image rendition.  
 
This adaptive gamut mapping algorithm decomposes the image tested into two bands (see Fig. 4), and can provide 
several available options: 1) re-render Ilow ; 2) rescale and remap its lightness range; and 3) adjust Ihigh using a scaling 
factor; 4) spatially filter or modify image considered using a more complex function [13]; 5) adjust the merging 
function of the two adjusted bands. Fig. 4 shows the adaptive algorithms derived in this study by the following process: 
• Conversion of the original Adobe RGB image to the CIELAB color space: Iin. 
• Decomposition of the CIELAB image into two bands using bilateral filtering (BF): Ilow and Ihigh. 
• Hue-Preserving MinimumΔE clipping [14](HPMinΔE clipping) (3) of the low-pass band Ilow: Ilow.  
[Iout = HPMinΔE (Iin), with Iin the original image and Iout the gamut mapped image.] 
• Adaptive merging of Ilow (4)and Ihigh(5): Iout . 
• Conversion to the sRGB encoding of the output LCD. 
function form, as well as the choice of anchor value, has a significant impact on the resulted appearance of images 
produced. Although more experimentations would be needed to obtain definite conclusions, it seems that the value, 
avL  or wL , chosen to anchor the mapping, has the more profound effect on the overall image appearance results.

3.2. Device Characterization and Gamut Mapping 
Eight images in Adobe RGB type (Fig. 6) were used to test the adaptive gamut mapping algorithms (GMAs) derived. 
Three mapping methods, including linear compression, S-shape compression and clipping were considered. Additionally, 
the GMAs were also tested, a) with or without plug-in of the USM filter; b) using or not using adjusted approach (i.e. 
spatial-and-color adaptive clipping/compression), to evaluate the filter rendition performance. The USM considered was 
used in the adjusted type of gamut mapping to compensate the smoothing effect of bilateral filter. In total, 7 GMA 
models were investigated. They are listed in Table 1.  
 
Finally, A set of forced-choice paired comparison psychophysical experiment were carried out, to make comparisons of 
colour appearance matching between the original images (displayed on the Adobe RGB LCD) and the reproduction 
images (displayed on the sRGB LCD). It was used to cross verify the prediction performances of those GMAs derived 
DCMs in question. A panel of 10 observers viewed a paired of reproductions randomly presented, and judged which of 
the two gave a better match (i.e. color fidelity) to an original image in question. The paired comparison results in terms 
of the z-score with 95% confidence limit (CL), for the combined 8 images, were summarized and plotted in Fig. 7. The 
results apparently showed that adjusted linear compression, using with and also without the adapted USM, 
outperformed the others. It implies that the use of both bilateral and USM filters significantly enhances the GMA 
rendering performance in cross-media color reproduction. 
 
impact on the field of digital imaging. Potential application areas include: image quality metrics; image coding and 
compression methods; perceptually-based image synthesis algorithms; image-based rendering.  
 
There is still much work to be done in this area. Future models should integrate multispectral type of device 
characterization models to reduce metamerism problems. A well-performed CIEXYZ type of multi-spectral Standard 
Observer mode was derived previously [2] to optimally reconstruct spectra of HDR scene. The Observer model, 
simulating responses of CIE 1931 color matching functions, was plugged-in a Winner algorithm with basis vectors. 
Those basic vectors used in the Winner algorithm were obtained using singular value decomposition method (SVD) 
which is based on a reflectance dataset of Glossy Munsell Book. A mean ΔE*00 value of 0.22 was found for reconstruct 
performances of the CIEXYZ multispectral Standard Observer model derived, under D65 white-point/illuminant. 
Therefore, via the multi-spectral Observer model, the broadband RGB type of Adobe RGB HDR images can be further 
satisfactorily transformed into the illuminant-independently multi-spectral images. The Adobe RGB type of both 
broadband (i.e. RGB format) and multi-spectral images can be, hence, preferably chosen as broadband and multi-
spectral originals (of HDR scene) respectively for high-rendition imaging applications across media of digital HDR 
cameras, displays and printers/presses considered. Therefore the goal of deriving an illuminant-independent type of 
HDR imaging module can be satisfactorily achieved; and it can be applied to optimally multi-spectrally reconstruct 
every color concerned in high-dynamic-range of original images for preferable cross-media color reproduction 
applications.

reproduction was firstly developed in this study. It was derived based on the approach suggested by Pattanaik et al. [3, 
4]. It carried out a multiscale representation of the human visual system; and then followed by using an equation similar 
to a photoreceptor adaptation equation, originally proposed by Michaelis-Menten [5, 6]. Moreover, with the 
incorporations of multiscale type adaptation-and-spatial vision model, HDR tone-mapping operator, device 
characterization and gamut mapping models, the module derived would mapped the vast ranges of radiances, found in 
real and synthetic scenes, into the small limited ranges available on conventional display devices of LCD’s and 
printers/presses.  
 
2. COMPUTAIONAL FRAMEWORK OF MODEL  
 
 
Figure 1. The specific computational procedures used to implement each step of the model. 
A HDR imaging module as mentioned earlier, based on a multiscale model of adaptation and spatial vision in human 
visual system, was developed and applied to the problems of realistic tone reproduction across imaging devices. 
Additionally, an adaptive gamut mapping algorithm, incorporated with device characterization models for both Adobe 
RGB and sRGB formats of LCD displays, was also plugged in the computation framework to carry out the optimization 
of HDR image rendering. The adaptive gamut mapping algorithm was implemented using both a bilateral filtering 
technique [7] and a multiple-conversing-points approach [8, 9]. The Adobe RGB format of LCD (EIZO Color Edge 
CG221) was characterized under D65 white point, and used as a soft-proofing platform to display/represent HDR RGB 
images, and also to evaluate rendition-quality of images produced. Moreover, an Un-Sharp Masking (USM), used for 
detail enhancement which was conventional and practically applied in color separation algorithm for graphic arts, was 
carried out in the optimization process of HDR image rendition quality when needed. The specific computational 
procedures that were used to implement each step of the model are described below. A pictorial representation of each 
stage of the model/algorithm applied is presented in Figure 1. 
2.1. Tone Mapping Algorithm  
The reproduction of the visual appearance of original scene is the ultimate goal in the tone mapping. Therefore the tone 
mapping algorithm developed here made use of adaptive and spatial visual model with multi-scale, to provide the 
solution to compress the dynamic range of the HDR image to fit into the display range while preserving details.  
attributes differ from the cones. The adapted contrast signals are then passed through contrast transducer functions. 
Different transducer functions are applied to each spatial frequency mechanism to approximate psychophysically 
derived human spatial contrast sensitivity functions. Two-part functions, consisting of two power functions, are chosen 
to replicate the two regions of distinct slope in the transducer functions. Again, the rods use a separate function. After 
the contrast transducers, the rod and cone signals can be combined to produce signals that represent the three-
dimensional color appearances of the input image. 
 
As this point, the output of the visual model consists of appearance signals in an achromatic and two chromatic channels, 
and six spatial band-pass mechanisms plus a low-pass image. These appearance signals can, then, be backward through 
the model to recreate cone signals (that replicate the full color appearance of the image on a photopic/trichromatic 
display device such as a LCD display), and ultimately device signals such as RGB or CMYK. 
 
Of all nonlinear mappings, logarithmic and exponential mappings are among the most straightforward. For medium 
dynamic range images, accommodated by current LDR display devices, these very simple solutions may still be 
competitively with more complex operators. Therefore, in this study, both logarithmic and exponential mapping 
operators were implemented to process luminance mapping using Eqns. 1 and 2 respectively.

Here, ( , )dL x y is the display luminance that is the quantity we wish to display; avL , average luminance; maxL , the 
maximum luminance on image; and ( , )wL x y , image luminance. The logarithm is a compressive function for values 
larger than 1; whereas the exponential mapping operators transforms world luminances to display luminances using the 
exponential function, bound between 0 for black pixels and 1 for infinitely bright pixels. 
2.2. Device Characterization and Gamut Mapping  
Two LCD with standard color space of Adobe RGB and sRGB 9 (both under D65 white point calibration) were used as 
displays of images. The Adobe RGB format of display was used as a soft-proofing platform to display/represent HDR 
RGB images, and also to evaluate both rendition-quality and prediction-performance of modules derived. Moreover, the 
sRGB LCD (EIZO ColorEdge CE240W) was used as LDR display, representing the common available LCD with 
intermediate limit of dynamic range. Therefore, an adaptive gamut mapping algorithm, introduced by Nicolas Bonnier 
et al. [7] mentioned earlier were also implemented in this study. By plugging bilateral filtering with a multiple 
conversing-points approach (Fig. 3), it maps the Adobe RGB image to sRGB images. Additionally, the adaptive GMA 
could also be incorporated with or without an adaptive Un-sharp Masking (USM), to carry out the optimization of HDR 
image rendition.  
 
This adaptive gamut mapping algorithm decomposes the image tested into two bands (see Fig. 4), and can provide 
several available options: 1) re-render Ilow ; 2) rescale and remap its lightness range; and 3) adjust Ihigh using a scaling 
factor; 4) spatially filter or modify image considered using a more complex function [13]; 5) adjust the merging 
function of the two adjusted bands. Fig. 4 shows the adaptive algorithms derived in this study by the following process: 
• Conversion of the original Adobe RGB image to the CIELAB color space: Iin. 
• Decomposition of the CIELAB image into two bands using bilateral filtering (BF): Ilow and Ihigh. 
• Hue-Preserving MinimumΔE clipping [14](HPMinΔE clipping) (3) of the low-pass band Ilow: Ilow.  
[Iout = HPMinΔE (Iin), with Iin the original image and Iout the gamut mapped image.] 
• Adaptive merging of Ilow (4)and Ihigh(5): Iout . 
• Conversion to the sRGB encoding of the output LCD. 
function form, as well as the choice of anchor value, has a significant impact on the resulted appearance of images 
produced. Although more experimentations would be needed to obtain definite conclusions, it seems that the value, 
avL  or wL , chosen to anchor the mapping, has the more profound effect on the overall image appearance results.

3.2. Device Characterization and Gamut Mapping 
Eight images in Adobe RGB type (Fig. 6) were used to test the adaptive gamut mapping algorithms (GMAs) derived. 
Three mapping methods, including linear compression, S-shape compression and clipping were considered. Additionally, 
the GMAs were also tested, a) with or without plug-in of the USM filter; b) using or not using adjusted approach (i.e. 
spatial-and-color adaptive clipping/compression), to evaluate the filter rendition performance. The USM considered was 
used in the adjusted type of gamut mapping to compensate the smoothing effect of bilateral filter. In total, 7 GMA 
models were investigated. They are listed in Table 1.  
 
Finally, A set of forced-choice paired comparison psychophysical experiment were carried out, to make comparisons of 
colour appearance matching between the original images (displayed on the Adobe RGB LCD) and the reproduction 
images (displayed on the sRGB LCD). It was used to cross verify the prediction performances of those GMAs derived 
DCMs in question. A panel of 10 observers viewed a paired of reproductions randomly presented, and judged which of 
the two gave a better match (i.e. color fidelity) to an original image in question. The paired comparison results in terms 
of the z-score with 95% confidence limit (CL), for the combined 8 images, were summarized and plotted in Fig. 7. The 
results apparently showed that adjusted linear compression, using with and also without the adapted USM, 
outperformed the others. It implies that the use of both bilateral and USM filters significantly enhances the GMA 
rendering performance in cross-media color reproduction.
