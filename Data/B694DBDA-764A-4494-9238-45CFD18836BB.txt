Because of the fundamental problems faced in hydrocarbon fuel reforming, alternative 
methods for gaining pure hydrogen are needed. Recently, hydrogen decomposed from NH3 has 
received much attention because there is no COx generation and the unconverted NH3 can be 
reduced using a suitable absorber [8-10]. Moreover, NH3 has higher energy density as compared 
with methanol and other fuels. NH3 decomposition is considered to be a more economical process 
for hydrogen generation [11, 12]. Since NH3 decomposition is endothermic and decomposition 
efficiency depends on the temperature, the reaction temperature should be as low as possible for 
on-site hydrogen supplier purposes. Recent researches on NH3 decomposition focused on 
experimentally finding a catalyst that can decompose NH3 at low temperature with a high 
decomposition rate [13-17]. It has been reported that NH3 decomposition efficiency of 99.1% can 
be achieved at 673K temperature using MgO-CNTs nano-composites as support and Ruthenium 
(Ru) as the catalyst [13, 14]. However, Ru is expansive and Nickel (Ni) could be an attractive 
cost alternative [13].  
 The theoretical studies on NH3 decomposition for fuel cell application are relatively few 
compared to experimental studies.  Using Ru as the catalyst, Deshmukh et al. [18] established 
theoretical and numerical models to predict hydrogen production from an aluminum-post 
micro-reactor [14]. Their results indicated that post arrangements inside the reactor play an 
important role in enhancing the decomposition rate. Abashar et al. [19] developed a mathematical 
model to predict the NH3 decomposition in a membrane reactor using Ni/Al2O3 as the catalyst. 
Their results showed that there appears an optimal effective reactor length for high 
decomposition rate, low temperature and low catalyst mass. Waghode et al. [20] developed a 
numerical model to describe the fluid dynamics and heat transfer in catalytic micro-reactor 
systems for NH3 decomposition over a monolayer Ni non-porous catalyst. Their primary focus 
was on the numerical technique for carrying the strongly coupled governing equations.  
This study explores NH3 decomposition from numerical simulations. A cylindrical reactor 
packed with Ni-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst particles is used as the physical domain. The equations 
governing the fluid flow, heat transfer and mass transfer with chemical reaction are solved 
simultaneously. Detailed analysis of the reaction temperature, catalyst particle size and catalyst 
bed porosity effects on the NH3 decomposition efficiency was performed. A one-dimensional 
analysis was also carried out based on the results obtained from the numerical simulations.  
 
2. Mathematical model 
2.1 Governing equations 
The reactor physical domain considered in this study is shown in Figure 1. The reactor is a 
circular tube with total length of and radius of . Ni-Pt/Al2O3 particles are packed inside 
the reactor.  Preheated gaseous NH3 with a volumetric flow rate  is fed into the reactor. The 
catalyst bed is heated to a prescribed reaction temperature using an external heat source. The 
following assumptions are made for simplifying the analysis:

respectively. Equation (2) is known as the Brinkman-Darcy-Forchheimer model for the fluid flow 
in porous media with homogeneous porosity. The porosity and permeability are two key factors 
that govern the fluid flow, heat transfer and mass transfer. Using the Carman-Kozeny model 
[21-23], the permeability for a packed bed with spherical particles can be written as,

3. Numerical model 
All of the governing equations were solved simultaneously using the commercial CFD code 
FLUENT v6.2 [31]. Because the numerical solution accuracy strongly depends on the mesh size, 
a refined mesh is necessary in the region where the dependent variable gradients are pronounced. 
Finer meshes were used to capture the subtle changes in velocity, temperature and species 
concentration in the near-wall region. The solution independence of the mesh size was carefully 
studied before reporting the final results. The numerical results show that the solutions become 
mesh-independent when the element number exceeds approximately 50000. Hence, the results 
presented in this study were for 100000 elements.  
 
4. Results and Discussion 
Because the chemical reaction model is established based on the experimental study by 
Chellappa et al. [25], the numerical parameters used in this study were chosen based on their 
study and listed in Table 1. The gas mixture inlet temperature is taken to be the same as that at the 
reactor wall in 813K to 893K range. The catalyst bed porosity range is determined based on the 
study by Graton and Fraser [32]. For the least compact sphere arrangement with simple cubical 
packing, the porosity is estimated as 0.26. The most compact packing is the rhombohedral, in 
which each sphere is tangential to 12 neighboring spheres and the porosity value is 0.48. The 
collision diameter and collision integral for calculating the gas mixture properties can be found in 
the textbook by Mills [24].  
In Figure 2, the numerical predictions of NH3 decomposition efficiency as function of catalyst 
loading to NH3 molar flow rate ratio (W/F) for various W and  under the reactor wall 
temperature =873K are compared with  the experimental results reported by Chellappa et al. 
[25]. The inlet pressure  is 1 bar and the inlet temperature is

By knowing the NH3 decomposition efficiency along the reactor length, the mole fraction 
variations of species in the reactor can then be computed. Under the typical conditions of 
ε =0.48, =40μm, =1 bar and W/F=10, mole fraction variations for H2, N2 and NH3 along 
the reactor length predicted by 1-D model are compared with the 2-D simulation as shown in 
Figure 5. It is seen that there is only a slight difference between the 1-D and 2-D predictions. For 
the T=893K case shown in Figure 5(b), as the decomposition efficiency approaches 1, the mole 
fraction of NH3 approaches zero, while the mole fractions of H2 and N2 approach the 
stochiometric values of 0.75 and 0.25, respectively.

Based on the results shown in Figure 5, the 1-D model can be used as an accurate and efficient 
tool for the reactor design. Using the 1-D model, the NH3 decomposition efficiency as functions 
of the reaction temperature and inlet pressure for various flow rates is shown in Figure 6 and  
compared with the experimental data reported by Ganley et al. using Ru as the catalyst [14] and a 
theoretical limit for NH3 decomposition efficiency based on thermodynamic equilibrium given as 
[33],

As shown in Figure 6, the decomposition efficiency increases linearly with the reaction 
temperature within a certain range of reaction temperatures under a given flow rate. A lower 
reaction temperature is required when the flow rate is small because of the increase in NH3 
residence time inside the reactor. Figure 6 also shows that the reaction temperature increases as 
the inlet pressure increases from 1 bar to 2 bars for a given flow rate under the fixed catalyst 
weight condition. This is because of the increase in molar flow rate due to the increase in inlet 
pressure as indicated in Eq. (19).
