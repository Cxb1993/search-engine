and silver nanoparticles were electrostatically adsorbed on the glass slides under 
particular conditions. A white light-emitting diode (LED) torch was employed to 
illuminate the glass slides, visual detection of the antibody can be observed by the 
naked eye. Also, colorimetric immunoassay using antibody-gold nanoparticle 
conjugate and silver enhancement has been demonstrated [19]. A flatbed scanner was 
utilized for the optical scanning and measuring the immuno-reaction signal on the 
glass slides. Moreover, gold nanoparticles have been applied to the electrochemical 
detection of protein binding activity [20-21]. The result of immunoassay was 
determined by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) through the oxidative gold metal 
dissolution in the acidic solution. Also, a chemiluminescent immunoassay which 
combined the chemiluminescent analysis with the signal amplification of silver 
precipitation on gold nanoparticles was developed [22]. Furthermore, the signal of 
SPR biosensor can be enhanced by labeling the secondary antibodies via gold 
nanoparticles [23].  
 
Objectives 
 In this work, electrical detection of sandwich immunoassay on a biochip was 
developed. The biochip was a glass substrate with indium tin oxide (ITO) 
interdigitated electrodes working as the detection sites. The electrical detection 
method has been demonstrated to detect the concentration of the target antigen during 
sandwich immunoassay on the detection sites. The immunoassay result can be 
determined by the resistance values across the electrodes and can be measured by an 
ohm-meter directly. This electrical detection method has the advantage of the 
detection without sophisticated laboratory equipment. It has the potential to develop a 
miniaturized immunoassay detector and can be integrated into a microfluidic system 
for developing a portable diagnostic device. 
 
Materials and methods 
Chemicals and reagents 
Human IgG, anti-human IgG, anti-human IgG-biotin conjugates, and bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma, USA. 
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and glutaraldehyde (GA) were purchased 
from Pierce, USA. Gold nanoparticles conjugated to streptavidin and gold 
enhancement solution were purchased from Nanoprobes, USA. Buffer used in this 
study was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM 
EDTA, pH 7.6). Distilled water was used throughout the experiments. All experiments 
were performed at room temperature (22-25°C).

Electrical detection of sandwich immunoassay 
 The electrical detection of sandwich immunoassay on the biochip is illustrated in 
Figure 2. Anti-human IgG, human IgG, and anti-human IgG-biotin conjugates were 
selected as the primary antibody, target antigen, and secondary antibody. After surface 
modification of the biochip, primary antibody was pipetted to the detection sites. The 
biochip was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. Then, the antibodies 
were covalently immobilized on the electrode surface as well as the glass surface in 
between the electrode gaps after incubation. After washing in PBS containing 0.05% 
Tween 20, blocking treatment (1% BSA in PBS) was performed to block the active 
site of unreacted GA. The biochip was immersed in the solution of the target antigen 
and then the secondary antibody, respectively. The target antigen and secondary 
antibody bound to the primary antibody and formed a sandwich-like complex on the 
detection sites.  
The electrical detection was carried out by tagging the secondary antibody to the 
gold nanoparticles. Nanogold-streptavidin conjugates in PBS solution containing 1% 
BSA (nanogold solution) were added to the biochip and incubated for 1 hour at room 
temperature. Gold nanoparticles were bound to the antibody via biotin-streptavidin 
linkage. Theoretically, the more antibody-biotin conjugates were immobilized on the 
reactive surface, the more gold nanoparticles could bind to the antibody. Because the 
gold nanoparticles were 1.4 nm in diameter, they were too tiny to connect the 
electrode fingers and generated detectable electrical signal. Then, gold enhancement 
process was performed to enlarge the gold nanoparticles physically. The enhanced 
gold particles can form a conductive layer on the detection site. Both ITO surface and 
glass surface were covered by the enhanced gold particles, as shown in Figure 3. In 
gold enhancement process, gold ions in solution were catalytically deposited onto the 
gold nanoparticles and aggregated to metallic gold precipitations. The density of the 
gold precipitations was based on the density of gold nanoparticles. After completion 
of the gold enhancement process, the biochip was rinsed in water and dried. The 
resistance values across the electrodes were measured by an ohm-meter directly. The 
concentrations of the target antigen can be represented by the resistance values.

IgG, in a certain concentration. 4 different concentrations, i.e., 20, 40, 80, and 160 
ng/ml, were selected for the experiment. The target antigens bound to the primary 
antibodies by incubating 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, the chip was 
immersed into the solution of the detection antibody, i.e., anti-human IgG-biotin, in 
1:5000 dilution. After 1 hour incubation, a sandwich-like complex was formed on the 
detection sites. 
 The electrical detection was based on the protocol shown in Figure 2. Briefly, the 
gold nanoparticles bound to the detection antibody by biotin-streptavidin linkage. 
Then, gold enhancement was performed for 15 minutes to enlarge the gold 
nanoparticles and bridge the electrode gaps. Therefore, the conductivity of the gold 
layer depended on the concentration of the target antigen. The resistance values across 
the electrodes were measured by an ohm-meter directly. The measurement results are 
shown in Figure 4. When the target antigen was presence and formed the 
sandwich-like complex, the resistance values were around 700-1200 ohm. When the 
target antigen was absent, the resistance value showed infinity, i.e., electrical open. 
The resistance values did not change significantly when the antigen concentration was 
above 80 ng/ml. The resistance value showed infinity when the antigen concentration 
was below 20 ng/ml. Therefore, the detection limit of the sandwich immunoassay was 
20 ng/ml.

increasing concentration of the antigen on the detection sites. The concentration of 
the antigen was 20, 40, 80, and 160 ng/ml.

for indicating the protein immobilizing on the ITO 
interdigitated electrodes. Then, gold enhancement process 
was performed to enlarge the gold nanoparticles. The 
enhanced metallic gold particles became a conductive layer 
across the interdigitated electrodes. The concentration of the 
immobilized protein can be determined by the resistance 
across the electrode gaps. This technique could be extended 
to the electrical detection of sandwich immunoassay. The 
proposed electrical detection method has the advantage of the 
detection without sophisticated laboratory equipment. It has 
the potential to develop a miniaturized immunoassay detector 
and integrate into a microfluidic system for developing a 
portable diagnostic device. 
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Chemicals and Reagents  
 Anti-mouse IgG-biotin conjugates and bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma, USA. 3-
aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and glutaraldehyde 
(GA) were purchased from Pierce, USA. Gold nanoparticles-
streptavidin conjugates and gold enhancement solution were 
purchased from Nanoprobes, USA. Buffer used in this study 
was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 mM phosphate, 150 
mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.6). Distilled water was used 
throughout the experiments. 
 
B. Fabrication of the Biochip and Surface Modification 
 The biochip was a 25 × 25 mm2 glass substrate with 
8 pairs of ITO interdigitated electrodes on the surface. The 
layout of the electrodes is illustrated in Figure 1. The ITO 
coated glass substrates were purchased from SPI Supplies, 
USA. The resistance of ITO surface was 8-12 ohms. The ITO 
interdigitated electrodes were fabricated by standard 
photolithography and wet etching. The hydrochloric acid 
(HCL) solution (1:1 HCL to DI water volumetric ratio, where 
HCL was the standard 37% HCL solution) was utilized as the 
ITO etchant. The ITO interdigitated electrode consisted of 11 
fingers with 50 µm gaps. Eight independent electrodes were 
fabricated on one single substrate. The detection site was the 
area of the interdigitated electrode, i.e., 1 × 1 mm2. Since ITO 
and glass are oxidative materials, both electrode and glass 
surface can be functionalized for protein immobilization. The 
target proteins were immobilized on the ITO electrode 
surface as well as on the glass surface, in the gaps between 
the electrode fingers. The surface of biochip was first 
functionalized before the protein immobilization, based on 
the reported method [22]. Briefly, the biochip was immersed 
in 5% (v/v) APTES in acetone for 30 minutes at room 
temperature. Then, it was rinsed thoroughly in acetone and 
distilled water, dried in nitrogen flow, and baked in oven at 
80°C for 2 hours. This could form a reactive amine on the 
surface. After the modification of APTES, the surface 
became hydrophobic. Then, 2.5% (v/v) GA in PBS was 
pipetted to the detection sites for 2 hour incubation at room 
temperature. The GA reacted with amino group on the 
surface and worked as a cross-linker between the surface and 
protein. After carefully rinsing with distilled water, the 
APTES-GA treated detection sites can be covalently 
immobilized by the protein for further experiments. 
 
C. Electrical Detection of the Immobilized Protein 
 The quantitative electrical detection of protein 
concentration on the ITO interdigitated electrode was based 
on gold nanoparticle indication followed by gold 
enhancement process. The anti-mouse IgG-biotin conjugate 
was chosen to immobilize directly on the detection sites for 
the demonstration of the electrical detection. This technique 
could be extended to the electrical detection of sandwich 
immunoassay. The schematic representation of the protocol is 
shown in Figure 2. After the surface modification of the 
biochip, different concentrations of protein were pipetted to 
the respective detection sites. The biochip was incubated for 
1 hour at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. Then, it was thoroughly 
washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The proteins 
were covalently immobilized on the detection sites, including 
both ITO electrode surface and glass surface of the electrode 
gaps. 1 hour blocking treatment (1% BSA in PBS) at room 
temperature was performed to block the active site of 
unreacted GA.  
 The detection was carried out by tagging the 
immobilized antibody-biotin conjugates to the gold 
nanoparticles. Nanogold-streptavidin conjugates in PBS 
solution containing 1% BSA (nanogold solution) were added 
to the biochip and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Gold nanoparticles were bound to the antibody via biotin-
streptavidin linkage. Theoretically, the more antibody-biotin 
conjugates immobilized on the reactive surface, the more 
gold nanoparticles could bind to the surface. Because the gold 
nanoparticles are 1.4 nm in diameter (http://www.nanoprobes. 
com), they are too tiny to connect the electrode fingers and 
generate detectable electrical signal. Therefore, gold 
enhancement process was performed and the gold 
nanoparticles could be enlarged. A conductive layer was 
formed across the electrode gaps, as shown in Figure 3. In 
gold enhancement process, gold ions in solution were

particles.  Two detection areas, i.e., 250 and 10 ng/ml, had 
been selected and the images are shown in Figure 4. The 
enhanced gold particles were indicated to be presence on both 
ITO electrode and glass surface. The distribution density of 
the particles was significantly decreased with the protein 
concentration from 250 to 10 ng/ml.  
 Theoretically, higher concentration of the protein 
immobilized on the detection site presents lower resistance of 
the electrode because of denser gold precipitations across the 
electrode gaps. The resistance values across the electrode 
gaps measured as a function of decreasing concentration of 
the immobilized protein is shown in Figure 5. The 
immobilized protein over the range between 5 and 1000 
ng/ml can be detected. The NC showed electrical 
disconnection across the electrode gap, i.e., open circuit. 
Therefore, quantification of the protein concentration on the 
biochip can be achieved by the electrical signal, i.e., 
resistance. This electrical detection method was not required 
sophisticated laboratory equipment. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Electrical detection method of protein concentration has 
been developed on the ITO interdigitated electrode on a glass 
substrate. The proposed protocol was to immobilize the 
protein in a certain concentration on the electrode. Gold 
nanoparticles were bound to the protein through biotin-
streptavidin linkage. Theoretically, the more protein 
immobilizes on the surface, the more gold nanoparticles 
could bind to the surface. Then, gold enhancement was 
performed for enlarging the gold nanoparticles. A conductive 
layer was formed across the electrode gaps. The electrical 
detection of the protein concentration can be achieved by 
measuring the resistance values across the electrode gaps. 
The protein concentrations between 5 and 1000 ng/ml were 
represented by the resistance values quantitatively. This 
electrical detection method can be extended and applied to 
sandwich immunoassay. Therefore, it is potentially to 
develop a portable diagnostic device integrated with a 
microfluidic system because there is no dedicated equipment 
involved, direct readable result, and easy implementation.
