壹、報告內容 
一、前言 
霧化噴嘴內外流場的模擬存在著物理模式和數值方法上的困難，因此，無論在國內或
國外，從事此方面研究的人均屈指可數，然而，此方面的研究確有其實用性與必要性；霧
化噴嘴內外流場的研究方法之一是使用較大尺寸的噴嘴模型以從事實驗研究，另一種方法
則是從事數值模擬分析，數值模擬分析的優點之一是可以從事實際尺寸的霧化噴嘴內部流
場模擬，這對於使用實驗方法而言是較難達成的；霧化噴嘴流場的模擬大致可分成巨觀分
析以及微觀分析兩類，兩者各有其優缺點，其中巨觀分析由於計算成本的經濟性，經常被
用來作為噴嘴設計時的輔助工具以進行參數分析（例如流量係數、噴霧錐角、液膜厚度、
噴嘴幾何外形等），然而，當液體離開噴嘴而霧化開始發生後，液體斷裂成小液滴，其尺寸
可達到分子的尺寸大小（約在奈米(nm)的階段），此時，基於連體觀念的 Navier-Stokes 方程
式已不適合模擬後續的霧化演進過程，在此情況下，微觀分析較適用於後續的模擬；筆者
於過去八年來曾以巨觀法針對霧化噴嘴內外流場進行一系列的數值模擬分析，研究中對於
霧化噴嘴內外流場的巨觀行為與特性，諸如流量係數、噴霧錐角、液膜厚度、噴嘴幾何外
形等均進行深入的探討，然而，如前所述，巨觀分析無法模擬液體離開噴嘴後霧化之微觀
演進過程，因此，前幾期計畫均只探討液體噴出後之初期發展（亦即尚未達到液體斷裂成
分子尺寸微小液滴的階段），為彌補此點，本研究擬使用微觀分析法來探討霧化噴嘴內外流
場之微觀演進過程，期盼藉由本計畫之執行能使吾人對於霧化噴嘴內外流場之細部演進過
程有更深入的瞭解，並提昇國內霧化噴嘴相關研究的水準。 
 
二、研究目的 
由於霧化噴嘴的模擬存在著物理模式和數值方法上的困難，因此，目前在國內外從事
此方面研究的人均屈指可數，然而，此方面的研究與發展確有其實用性與必要性。筆者在
過去八年來曾以巨觀分析法針對霧化噴嘴內外流場進行一系列的數值模擬研究，研究中對
於霧化噴嘴流場的巨觀行為與特性，諸如流量係數、噴霧錐角、液膜厚度、噴嘴幾何外形
等均進行深入的剖析，然而，如前所述，巨觀分析法無法模擬液體離開噴嘴後霧化之微觀
演進過程，為彌補此點，本研究擬自本期計畫起，使用微觀分析法探討霧化噴嘴流場之微
觀演進過程，冀使吾人對於霧化之詳細演進過程能更深入瞭解，並提昇國內有關霧化噴嘴
研究的水準。 
 
三、文獻探討 
茲將最近與霧化噴嘴研究相關的重要參考文獻分成下列三大類別加以評述： 
1. 霧化噴嘴流場實驗研究相關文獻， 
2. 霧化噴嘴內外流場數值模擬分析相關文獻， 
3.霧化現象之微觀演進過程分析相關文獻。 
III.1 最近有關於霧化噴嘴流場實驗研究的相關文獻整理如下：

5. 2000 年，Jang 和 Choi[34]使用商用軟體（CFD-ACE+4）來計算模擬壓力漩渦式霧化噴
嘴內部流場對噴霧特性的影響，其研究中僅從事定性的分析，而未涉及定量的探討。 
6. 2000 年，Steinthorsson 和 Lee[35]研究三維壓力漩渦式霧化噴嘴內部流場，其研究中使

7. 1997 年，Yule 和 Chinn[36,37]亦使用商用軟體（FLUENT）來研究單孔式噴嘴流場，
其研究侷限於層流的模擬。 
8. 在國內，筆者葉俊郎曾以數值方法模擬分析平坦孔口式及壓力漩渦式霧化噴嘴內外流
場，研究成果已大致能掌握霧化噴嘴之基本特性，如噴霧錐角、流量係數、液膜厚度、
霧化噴嘴內外兩相界面演進等。由研究結果發現，在層流場模擬方面，計算結果不論
在量或趨勢上均非常接近實驗數據，但在紊流場模擬方面，各紊流模式之計算結果差
異性頗大；在前期計畫中已完成五種 LEVM 紊流模式、兩種 NEVM/ARSM 紊流模式
及一種 DRSM 紊流模式對於平坦孔口式及壓力漩渦式霧化噴嘴內外流場模擬之評估，
透過本計畫之執行，希望能對紊流模式於霧化噴嘴內外流場模擬之效果進行完整的研
究與評估，以提高此類流場預測時的準確性，並深入地瞭解霧化噴嘴流場之特性及重
要參數對於霧化過程與效果之影響。 
9. 在國內，曾培元等人[38,39]曾使用 PHOENICS 3.1 軟體來模擬平坦孔口式及壓力漩渦
式霧化噴嘴流場，探討進口渦漩強度、進口紊流強度及進出口壓差等參數對於流場特
性之影響，但其研究中並未將霧化噴嘴內部液氣兩相間的相互影響及演進納入考慮，
因此，噴嘴出口處的流況與真實的情況尚有差距。 
III.3 最近有關於霧化現象之微觀演進過程分析相關文獻整理如下： 
1. 2001 年，Micci 等人[4]使用分子動力學模擬來探討霧化過程，文中描述了分子動力學
應用於液滴霧化過程之模擬方法，其研究結果顯示，分子動力學法可自然地模擬出液
滴形成、碰撞、合併、崩解等現象，而不需做任何人為的假設或兩相介面追蹤。 
2. 2000 年，Moseler 和 Landman[5]使用分子動力學模擬來探討奈米噴流之形成、穩定性、
及崩解過程，其研究結果發現，當噴流達到分子（奈米）尺度時，會有雙圓錐形頸部
（Double-Cone Neck）波形出現，其文中亦比較了連體液壓動力模式中的隨機潤滑方
程式（Stochastic Lubrication Equation）的模擬效果，其研究結果指出，基於連體觀念
所推導而得的隨機潤滑方程式法之模擬結果雖然接近分子動力學法的模擬結果，但仍
然有改善的空間。 
3. 2000 年，柏克萊大學前校長田長霖等人[6]使用分子動力學模擬來探討液膜厚度對液膜
穩定性之影響，其研究中使用 Lennard-Jones 勢能函數來求解粒子間的作用力，研究結
果顯示當液膜變薄時，平行於液膜表面的張力較大，而這將導致液膜的不穩定。 
4. 2000 年，Korlie[7]使用分子動力學模擬來探討液滴蒸發的過程，其研究中使用
Lennard-Jones 勢能函數來求解粒子間的作用力，文中探討熱量及蒸氣的分子速度對於
蒸發及凝結的影響，對於水的蒸發及凝結過程有很詳盡的描述。 
5. 1998 年，Kawano[8]使用分子動力學模擬來探討液體崩解現象，其研究中使用
 5
630m/s（6.3
o
A /ps），吾人可指定該速率為起始速度之大小，而起始速度之方向可利用乘法
亂數產生器（Multiplicative Random Generator）來產生。 
在研究系統現象時，吾人有興趣者不僅限於每一分子之瞬時速度，也須探討該分子歷
經一段時間後之平均速度，本計畫擬採用 Greenspan [11]所提出之分子平均速度計算方法。 
IV.3 數值方法 
在運動方程式的求解方面，較普遍使用的方法有修正型 Verlet 法（又稱為蛙跳法；
Modified Verlet Algorithm or Leap Frog Method）[12,40]及 Gear 所提出的預測校正法[41,42]，
蛙跳法可直接求取原子的下一時階的新位置，使運算過程較為簡單，Gear 的預測校正法主
要包含預測與校正兩大步驟，它可使用不同的階數來進行計算，取的階數越多，計算結果
越準確。本計畫擬採用上述二法來求解一連串的牛頓運動方程式，以計算出系統中之各種
現象及傳輸性質，並比較上述二法的效果。 
IV.4 截斷半徑法 
兩原子間的交互作用隨著其間的距離增加而減少，當大於某臨界距離時，其間的作用
力可以忽略，此臨界距離稱為截斷半徑，當距離超過截斷半徑時，兩原子間的交互作用幾
近於零，對於模擬結果沒有影響，因此，可不予計算，以節省計算次數。 
當選定適當的勢能函數及設定初始條件後，分子動力學模擬即可進行，以一個使用二
體勢能函數的 N 個原子系統的模擬為例，若不使用任何的截斷半徑法，則其原子間的勢能
或是力量的計算次數均為 N(N-1)/2 次，每一時階的計算次數隨著原子數的平方倍成長，將
耗費大量的計算時間，因此，截斷半徑法的使用有助於提昇計算效率。 
目前較普遍使用的截斷半徑法包含 Verlet 表列法[13,14]、Cell Link 表列法[14]、及 Verlet
表列結合 Cell Link 表列法[14]。Verlet 表列法與 Cell Link 表列法均是在特定的時階間隔建
立每一個原子與周圍原子間的關係，兩者的差別在於 Verlet 表列法是以 Verlet 表列半徑內
的原子去判斷哪些原子位於截斷半徑之內，以 N 個原子系統而言，Verlet 表列法因需建立
任兩個原子間的距離關係，其原子間的計算次數為 N(N-1)/2 次，而 Cell Link 表列法是以各
原子所屬 Cell 的位置來判斷哪些原子位於鄰近 Cell 之內，因此，只需要 N 次運算即可得到
每一個原子所在的 Cell 位置，再利用各 Cell 之間的相對關係進行運算。由於 Cell Link 表列
所包含的範圍大於 Verlet 表列半徑所包含的範圍，因此，Cell Link 表列所建立的原子數會
大於 Verlet 表列所建立的原子數，然而，由於 Cell Link 表列法在建立各原子所屬 Cell 位置
時只需 N 次的運算，故 Cell Link 表列法效率高於 Verlet 表列法。 
由以上所述可知，Verlet 表列法與 Cell Link 表列法各有優點，Cell Link 表列法可以較
少的運算得到系統中各原子的相對位置，而 Verlet 表列法可以較少的原子數去判斷哪些原
子位於截斷半徑內，因此，結合此二種方法之優點可以獲得最佳之計算效率，吾人以 Cell 
Link 表列法定出系統中各原子的相對位置關係，再對相鄰 Cell 中的原子建立各原子 Verlet
表列半徑內原子的分佈情形，最後，對原子作力或能量的運算時，只需以 Verlet 表列半徑
內的原子來判斷哪些原子位於截斷半徑之內即可，其所獲得的表列與只使用 Verlet 表列法
所得到的結果一模一樣，但省下的計算時間卻非常可觀，因此，本計畫擬採用 Verlet 表列
結合 Cell Link 表列法。 
IV.5 分子速度修正 
當一系統之溫度為固定且處於穩定狀態時，系統內的分子速度必須遵循馬克士威爾分
佈（Maxwell Distribution），以此法則吾人可以確認系統之分子處於穩定狀態，故起始之分

貳、計畫成果自評 
    本期計畫中探討了奈米尺度液狀線條之霧化過程，包括液氣兩相介面的不穩定運動、
表面張力效應、流體的崩解、液滴的形成、碰撞、結合等。液狀線條之形成為霧化過程中
重要的一環，在現有的研究中，大多僅分析至液體質點的形成，鮮少有關於後續崩解、碰
撞與合併過程之探討，然而，上述現象對於整體霧化過程扮演著重要角色，本計畫除分析
液體質點之形成外，並探討其後續崩解、碰撞與合併過程，期使吾人對於整體霧化過程能

also on its subsequent evolution. This will provide a 
more complete information for the entire rupture 
phenomena of a liquid thread and will be helpful in 
understanding the liquid atomization process. 
 
2. Molecular Dynamics Methodology 
In this study, the atomization process of the liquid 
thread is investigated by molecular dynamics（MD）
simulation. The inter-atomic potential is one of the 
most important parts of MD simulation. Many 
possible potential models exist, such as hard sphere, 
soft sphere, square well, etc [9]. In this research, the 
Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential model, which is widely 
used, is adopted for calculation. It is

where r denotes the distance between two molecules, 
ε and σ are the representative scales of energy and 
length, respectively. The Lennard-Jones fluid in this 
research is taken to be argon for its ease of physical 
understanding. The parameters for argon are as 
follows [8] : the length parameter σ=0.354 nm, the 
energy parameter ε/kB=93.3K, and the molecular 
weight m=6.64×10-26 kg, where kB=1.38×10-23 J/K 
denotes Boltzmann constant. The cut-off radius rc 
beyond which the intermolecular interaction is 
neglected is 5.0σ. 
   The simulation domain is schematically shown in 
Fig.2, with periodic boundary conditions applied in 
all three directions. Simulation domain dimensions, 
number densities and number of atoms are listed in 
Table 1, together with some simulation results. The 
time integration of motion is performed by Gear’s 
fifth predictor-corrector method [9] with a time step 
of △t*=0.001（i.e. 2.5 fs）. Note that all quantities 
with an asterisk in this paper, such as L*, R*, ρ*, △t*, 
etc., are non-dimensionalized in terms of σ, ε, and m. 
    Initially a cylindrical liquid thread of length L* 
and radius R* is placed at the center of the 
computational domain and the remaining space is 
either in vacuum or filled with vapor molecules. The 
system temperature is kept at T*=0.75. The initial 
densities of the liquid and vapor are ρL*=0.819 and 
ρV*=0.0031, respectively. These dimensionless values 
correspond to T=70K, ρL=1223 kg/m3, and ρV=4.63 
kg/m3 for argon. The computational conditions of T*, 
ρL*, and ρV* were chosen considering the phase 
diagram of the Lennard-Jones fluids [8]. That is, T* 
was set at a value higher than the triple point 
temperature. The values of ρL*, and ρV* were set to be 
the liquid and vapor densities, respectively, in the 
coexistence properties for the Lennard-Jones fluids. 
The vapor and liquid molecules have been 
equilibrated individually for 106 time steps at the 
system temperature T* before they are put together 
into the computational domain. Velocity rescaling is 
performed at each time step by the following 
correction to make sure that the system is at the 
desired temperature :

where vinew and viold are the velocities of molecule i 
after and before correction, respectively, and TD and 
TA are the desired and the actual system temperatures, 
respectively. A minimum image method and the 
Verlet neighbor list scheme [9] to keep track of 
which molecules are actually interacting at a given 
time interval 0.005t* are used. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
In the following discussion, a cylindrical liquid 
thread of length L* and radius R* is placed at the 
center of the computational domain and the 
remaining space is either in vacuum or filled with 
vapor molecules, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Simulation 
domain dimensions, number densities and number of 
atoms are listed in Table 1. 
3.1 Liquid Thread Together with Vapor Molecules 
   Figure 3 shows the vaporization process of a 
liquid thread of L*=120 and R*=3, which 
corresponds to L=42.5nm and R=1.06nm. The dot in 
Fig.3 indicates the center of the molecule. It is found 
that rupture of the liquid thread occurs at about t*=30. 
After t*=30, the molecules begin to form liquid 
particles by the contraction motion of molecules in 
the axial direction of the liquid thread. Two liquid 
particles are formed at about t*=60. At about t*=80, 
the two liquid particles break up and evaporate into 
the vapor. If the radius of the liquid thread becomes 
larger, say R*=4, no rupture of the liquid thread is 
found, as can be observed from Fig.4. The liquid 
thread gets shorter due to the contraction motion in 
its axial direction and break up phenomenon occurs at 
about t*=80. The liquid thread breaks up into small 
liquid particles first（t*=90） and then evaporates into 
the vapor. During the subsequent evaporation process
（t* 100≧ ）, it is observed that collision, coalescence, 
and breakup of some liquid particles occurs. Collision 
and coalescence of the liquid particles can be seen in 
the parts enclosed by the dashed circles for 
100≦t*≦140 in Fig.4. Breakup of the liquid 
particles begins at about t*=150. Collision, 
coalescence and breakup of the liquid particles play 
important roles in the atomization process. Collision 
of liquid particles can result in smaller liquid particles, 
which is helpful for atomization. On the other hand, 
some liquid particles can coalesce to form a larger 
liquid particle and then break up into smaller liquid 
particles, which is also helpful for atomization. The 
atomization process for a liquid thread of R*=5, as 
shown in Fig.5, is similar to that for R*=4, except

phenomenon can be observed. When the remaining 
space is filled with vapor molecules, as discussed 
previously, a thinner liquid thread evaporates faster. 
However, when the liquid thread is in vacuum, a 
thinner liquid thread does not necessarily evaporate 
faster, for example, comparing the cases of R*=2, 3 
and 4. As stated above, the surrounding medium 
provides more molecular collisions and this is helpful 
for evaporation. When the remaining space is in 
vacuum, no surrounding vapor molecules exist 
originally and the surrounding medium comes 
entirely from the evaporation of the liquid thread. A 
thicker liquid thread provides more evaporated 
molecules to act as the role of the surrounding 
medium and in turn can provide more molecular 
collisions, which is helpful for evaporation. However, 
when the liquid thread in vacuum gets thick, for 
example, comparing the case of R*=5 with that of 
R*=4, the result is similar to the liquid thread with 
the remaining space filled with vapor molecules, i.e., 
a thinner liquid thread（R*=4）evaporates faster. The 
above discussion will be further illustrated in a later 
section discussing the intermolecular force. 
   In order to further understand the effect of the 
fundamental cell size on the atomization process of a 
liquid thread in vacuum, four different fundamental 
cell sizes, 60×60×60, 120×120×120 and 
240×240×240, and 360×360×360 are investigated, in 
which the radii of the liquid thread are kept at R*=3. 
Note that the result of 120×120×120 has been shown 
in Fig.9 and will not be repeated again. Figure 13 
shows the evaporation process for a fundamental cell 
size of 60×60×60. It is observed that one liquid 
particle is formed at about t*=80 by the contraction 
motion of molecules in the axial direction of the 
liquid thread for this fundamental cell size. At about 
t*=220, the liquid particle begins to break up and 
evaporate into the vapor. For a larger fundamental 
cell size, say 240×240×240, in contrary to the case of 
a liquid thread with the remaining space filled with 
vapor molecules, no rupture of the liquid thread in 
vacuum occurs, as can be observed from Fig.14. One 
liquid particle is formed at about t*=210. At about 
t*=290, the liquid particle begins to break up and 
evaporate into the vapor. If the fundamental cell size 
is further enlarged to360×360×360, rupture of the 
liquid thread occurs at about t*=110, as can be 
observed from Fig.15. The molecules begin to form 
liquid particles by the contraction motion of 
molecules in the axial direction of the liquid thread 
after t*=110 and four liquid particles are formed at 
about t*=170. After t*=220, the four liquid particles 
break up and evaporate into the vapor. From the 
above discussion it is seen that the fundamental cell 
size does affect the atomization process by molecular 
dynamics simulation using periodic boundary 
condition. This result corroborates that in the 
previous section for the liquid thread with the 
remaining space filled with vapor molecules. In 
addition, it can be observed by comparison that a 
liquid thread with the remaining space filled with 
vapor molecules evaporates faster than a liquid thread 
in vacuum. 
 
4. Conclusion 
  In this study, the evaporation process of liquid 
threads is investigated by molecular dynamics 
simulation. The present analysis focuses not only on 
the liquid particle formation but also on its 
subsequent evolution, which involves breakup, 
collision, and coalescence of the liquid particles. 
These phenomena play important roles in the entire 
atomization process. The present study provides a 
more complete information for the entire rupture 
phenomena of a liquid thread and is helpful in 
understanding the liquid atomization process.

understanding. The cut-off radius rc beyond which the 
intermolecular interaction is neglected is 5.0σ. 
   The simulation domain is schematically shown in 
Fig.1, with periodic boundary conditions applied in all 
three directions. Simulation domain dimensions, 
number densities and number of molecules are listed in 
Table 1, together with some simulation results. The 
time integration of motion is performed by Gear’s fifth 
predictor-corrector method (Haile, J. M., 1992) with a 
time step of △t*=0.001（i.e. 2.5 fs）. 
    Initially a cylindrical liquid thread of length L* 
and radius R* is placed at the center of the 
computational domain and the remaining space is either 
in vacuum or filled with vapor molecules. The system 
temperature is kept at T*=0.75. The initial densities of 
the liquid and vapor are ρL*=0.819 and ρV*=0.0031 or 0, 
respectively. The vapor and liquid molecules have been 
equilibrated individually for 106 time steps at the 
system temperature T* before they are put together into 
the computational domain. Velocity rescaling is 
performed at each time step to make sure that the 
system is at the desired temperature A minimum image 
method and the Verlet neighbor list scheme (Haile, J. 
M., 1992) to keep track of which molecules are actually 
interacting at a given time interval of 0.005 are used. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
 
   Figure 2 shows the vaporization process of a liquid 
thread of L*=120 and R*=3, which corresponds to 
L=42.5nm and R=1.06nm. It is found that rupture of the 
liquid thread occurs at about t*=30. After t*=30, the 
molecules evolve into liquid particles by the 
contraction motion of molecules in the axial direction 
of the liquid thread. Two liquid particles are formed at 
about t*=60 and they break up and evaporate into the 
surroundings at about t*=80. If the radius of the liquid 
thread becomes larger, say R*=4, no rupture of the 
liquid thread is found. The vaporization process for a 
liquid thread of R*=5 is similar to that for R*=4. It can 
also be observed that thicker liquid threads（R*=4 and 
5）break up into small liquid particles directly without 
rupturing first. If the radius of the liquid thread 
becomes smaller, say R*=2, rupture of the liquid thread 
occurs earlier than for R*=3. About nine liquid particles 
are formed at t*=20. Collision, coalescence, and 
breakup of the liquid particles for R*=2 occur earlier 
than for R*=3. A thinner liquid thread evaporates 
quicker. 
   Figure 3 shows the vaporization process of a liquid 
thread of L*=120 and R*=3 in vacuum. It is observed 
that rupture of the liquid thread does not occur. This is 
because the contraction motion in the lateral direction 
of the liquid thread is slower than that in its axial 
direction. Only one liquid particle is formed at about 
t*=140. At about t*=290, the liquid particle breaks up 
into smaller liquid particles and evaporates into the 
surroundings. Compared with the case of a liquid 
thread in vapor, a liquid thread in vacuum requires 
longer time to evaporate. Comparing the case of a 
liquid thread in vacuum with that of a corresponding 
liquid thread in vapor, it is seen that the latter case 
evaporates faster. Molecular interactions play important 
roles in the vaporization process. When the remaining 
space is filled with vapor molecules, the surrounding 
vapor molecules provide more molecular interactions. 
This results in the formation of more liquid particles. 
On the other hand, when the remaining space is a 
vacuum, less molecular interactions are provided and 
vaporization of the liquid thread in earlier stage is 
mainly attributed to the molecular diffusion. In addition, 
when the remaining space is filled with vapor 
molecules, as discussed previously, a thinner liquid 
thread evaporates faster. However, when the liquid 
thread is in vacuum, a thinner liquid thread does not 
necessarily evaporate faster. For example, comparing 
the cases of R*=3 and 4, the case of R*=4 evaporates 
faster than that of R*=3. As stated above, the 
surrounding medium provides more molecular 
interactions and this is conducive to vaporization. 
When the remaining space is in vacuum, no 
surrounding vapor molecules exist initially and the 
surrounding medium comes entirely from the 
vaporization of the liquid thread. A thicker liquid 
thread may create more evaporated molecules to act as 
the role of the surrounding medium and this in turn 
provides more molecular interactions, which is 
conducive to vaporization.  
A liquid thread is considered to vaporize faster if the 
distribution of molecules reaches a uniform state 
quicker during the vaporization process. This criterion 
essentially concerns with the evolution of the density 
distribution. Figure 4 shows the evolution of density 
uniformity factor for liquid threads with different radii 
and the conditions of L*=120, ρL*=0.819 and 
ρV*=0.0031. The density uniformity factor is defined as ( )

where N is the total number of molecules in the 
fundamental cell, ρ* and △V are the density and 
volume of molecule i, respectively, and ρ*eq is the 
density value when the molecules are uniformly 
distributed, i.e. ρ*eq≡Nmol / Vol, where Vol is the 
volume of the fundamental cell. The density uniformity 
factor fρ as defined by Eq.(1) represents the deviation 
from uniform state. From Fig.4 it is observed that a 
thinner liquid thread evaporates faster than a thicker 
one. The time averaged value of the density uniformity 
factor, ρf , in a time interval of t*=0 to 350, as listed in 
Table 1, also reveals this observation. Figure 5 shows 
the situation for a liquid thread in vacuum. When the 
liquid thread is in vacuum a thinner liquid thread does 
not necessarily evaporate faster as explained earlier.  
The intermolecular force is an indication of the 
surface tension experienced by the liquid particles and 
has a great effect upon the vaporization process. Figure

Abstract 
  The vaporization process of a nano-scale liquid thread in vapor or vacuum is analyzed by molecular 
dynamics simulation. The formation of liquid threads is one of the most fundamental and important 
phenomena during the atomization process. In the existing researches for this topic, most of the analyses 
were performed only down to the stage of formation of liquid particles. The present analysis focuses not 
only on the liquid particle formation but also on its subsequent evolution, which plays an important role in 
the entire vaporization process. In this study, snapshots of the molecules, evolution of the density field, 
and evolution of the intermolecular force are analyzed. Finally, the Rayleigh’s stability criterion is 
assessed for its validity in molecular scale. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Investigation of the atomizer flow receives 
considerable attentions because of its wide range of 
applications in many fields, e.g. industrial processes, 
agriculture, meteorology, medicine, etc. A 
comprehensive literature review for the experimental 
and numerical investigations of the atomizer flow has 
been done in the author’s previous studies (Yeh, C. L., 
2008, 2007), in which a series of analyses for the 
atomizer internal and external flows have also been 
conducted. The macroscopic behavior and 
characteristics of the atomizer flow, such as discharge 
coefficient, spray angle, film thickness, atomizer 
geometry, etc. were analyzed therein. However, when 
liquid breaks up into ultra-fine nano-scale droplets, the 
Navier-Stokes equations, which are derived based on 
continuum concept, are no longer valid for simulation 
of the subsequent atomization process. In order to 
overcome this inherent deficiency, the macroscopic 
analysis has to be replaced by the microscopic analysis 
for later stage of the atomization process. 
Koplik and Banavar (1993) studied the Rayleigh 
instability of a cylindrical liquid thread in vacuum by 
three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulation. The 
maximum number of molecules they used consists of 
8192 liquid argon Lennard-Jones molecules for a 
cylindrical liquid thread of non-dimensionalized radius 
of 7.5 in a box of non-dimensionalized length of 54.7. 
For this simulation condition, only one liquid particle 
was formed. Kawano (1998) applied 10278 
Lennard-Jones molecules of liquid and vapor coexisting 
argon in three dimensions to analyze the interfacial 
motion of a cylindrical liquid thread of 
non-dimensionalized radii of 2.0 to 4.0 in a box of 
maximum non-dimensionalized length of 120. For this 
condition of larger computational domain, a maximum 
number of 8 to 9 liquid particles were observed. 
In the above molecular dynamics studies, the 
analyses were performed only down to the stage of the 
formation of liquid particles. Subsequent evolution, 
which involves breakup, collision, and coalescence of 
the liquid particles, were not analyzed in detail. 
However, these phenomena play important roles in the 
entire vaporization process. The present analysis 
therefore focuses not only on the liquid particle 
formation but also on its subsequent evolution, with the 
aim to provide a detailed illustration for the 
vaporization process of a liquid thread. 
 
2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation  
 
In this study, the vaporization process of a liquid 
thread is investigated by molecular dynamics（MD）
simulation. The Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential model 
(Haile, J. M., 1992), which is widely used, is adopted 
for calculation. The Lennard-Jones fluid in this research 
is taken to be argon for its ease of physical

6 shows the evolution of averaged non-dimensionalized 
intermolecular force for liquid threads with different 
radii and the conditions of L*=120, ρL*=0.819 and 
ρV*=0.0031. The averaged non-dimensionalized 
intermolecular force at time t* is defined as

              （2） 
where N is the total number of molecules in the 
fundamental cell and F*i,t* is the non-dimensionalized 
intermolecular force acting on molecule i at time t*. 
From Fig.6, it is observed that a thinner liquid thread 
evaporates faster than a thicker one. The time averaged 
value of the averaged non-dimensionalized 
intermolecular force, *F , in a time interval of t*=0 to 
350, as listed in Table 1, also reveals this observation. 
Figure 7 shows the situation for a liquid thread in 
vacuum. When the liquid thread is in vacuum, a thinner 
liquid thread does not necessarily evaporate faster as 
explained earlier. 
The linear stability of a liquid jet was first studied by 
Lord Rayleigh (1879). A liquid thread of Radius R is 
unstable and will break up into drops to minimize the 
surface energy if the axial wavelength of the surface 
perturbation L≧2πR. If L<2πR, the thread is stable and 
will remain intact. Owing to the periodic boundary 
conditions in this study, the fundamental cell size L* 
can be regarded as the longest wavelength of the 
perturbation. Because L*≧2πR* for all the cases 
studied in this research, the liquid threads in this 
research are all unstable and ultimately break up. This 
agrees with Rayleigh’s stability criterion of liquid 
threads. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
  In this study, the vaporization process of a liquid 
thread is investigated by molecular dynamics 
simulation. It is found that a thinner liquid thread 
ruptures first before it breaks up, while a thicker liquid 
thread breaks up directly without rupturing first. A 
liquid thread in vapor ruptures earlier and produces 
more liquid particles than a corresponding liquid thread 
in vacuum. In addition, a liquid thread in vapor 
evaporates faster than a corresponding liquid thread in 
vacuum. A thinner liquid thread in vapor evaporates 
faster than a thicker one, while a thinner liquid thread in 
vacuum does not necessarily evaporate faster than a 
thicker one. Finally, the result of this research reveals 
that Rayleigh’s stability criterion holds down to the 
molecular scale.
