計畫內容: 奈米鐵微粒之製備及其在鎳鐵電池之應用 
研究背景： 
電池是現今人類使用能源最重要的方式之一，由於電池技術的持續發展，許多可攜式
電子產品的發展才有可能持續蓬勃。目前在高容量二次電池的開發上以改進鋰離子特性為
主，近期的研究鋰離子電池能量密度已達到 180 wh/kg 以上，比現有市售產品之 120~150 
wh/kg 高出甚多而且還在進步當中。然而在另一個重要應用--電動車電池，鋰電池卻一直
面臨著安全疑慮與成本過高的問題，雖然許多研究針對此一目標開發出較安全且成本低的
LiMn2O4及 LiFePO4等新正極材料，但成本仍為鉛酸電池 4～5 倍以上，安全疑慮未完全消除，
能量密度亦降為 90~100 wh/kg。 
另一廣泛使用的二次電池--鎳氫電池，以較低成本、循環壽命達 1000 次，且安全性比
鋰離子電池好，也在二次電池市場佔有一席之地。不過儲氫合金成本高，加上電池自放電
大，在大型電池領域推展也不是很順利。 
鎳鐵電池於二十世紀初被商業化，結構上鎳鐵電池與鎳氫電池差異僅在負極使用鐵，
且放電電壓亦非常相近。其正極使用氫氧化鎳，放電量約為 260 m Ah/g，負極則使用鐵的
理論電容量高達 962 mAh/g，與儲氫合金電量約 350 mAh/g 相比具有很大潛力，過去各研
究機構對鎳氫電池投入大量的研究，在正極材料及電解液配方面取得相當好的成果，若加
上成本的考量及現今材料技術的進步，以奈米材料的角度進行鎳鐵電池研究，是一個很好
的方向。因此，若能開發出適合於電池特性的奈米鐵做為電極材料，並研究適當電極製作
方式，鐵電極活性材料的放電容量應當能獲得提升，且奈米鐵相對大的表面積將使得電池
大電流放電特性與低溫放電特性皆獲得明顯改善。屆時，鎳鐵電池性能將與鎳氫電池不相
上下，而成本卻大幅降低。更進一步的，我們如果能夠透過研究一些表面修飾技術穩定鐵
粉在放電過程的導電通路與降低自放電，鐵的放電量會更接近理論容量，如果鎳鐵電池的
能量密度可達 90 Wh/kg 以上，則與鋰錳化合物鋰電池相同，十分適合作為輕型電動交通工
具使用，且在成本與安全上比鋰離子電池更有優勢。

在有添加分散劑 PAA 與在高 pH 的環境中，合成奈米鐵微粒，若無添加成核促進劑時，
所合成之奈米鐵微粒之型態與粒徑分佈如圖 3 所示，其幾何平均粒徑為 110 nm，而幾何標

在添加成核促進劑合成奈米鐵微粒的實驗中，由於此時合成的奈米鐵微粒並無法以強
力磁鐵分離，因此利用丙酮法沉澱，在分散後其產物的形態與粒徑分佈如圖 4 所示，其幾
何平均粒徑為 6 nm，而標準差為 1.3。利用電子繞設法分析其組成，與文獻做比較，可以
發現其成分主要亦為 Fe。此奈米鐵微粒懸浮膠體十分穩定，可以長期保存而不會有任何沉
澱發生，然而，溶液中卻含有大量的 PAA 無法去除。

    藉由 SEM 觀察還原鐵粉，如圖 7，可發現，大部分還原的鐵微粒呈現圓球狀，粒徑分
佈從 200nm 至 2um，顯示原本團聚的氧化鐵微粒在被還原之後發生燒結，由於團聚的情形
不同致使最後鐵微粒大小呈現較寬廣分佈，與原始氧化鐵的窄分佈明顯不同。由於在高溫
固相還原法前驅物粉體原本就互相堆積在一起，所以燒結成大顆粒是很難避免的現象。

二、 奈米鐵電極製作與特性測試 
將奈米鐵微粒分離清洗過後，獲得奈米鐵微粒的黑色膏狀物。將此奈米鐵膏狀物以刮
刀塞填進泡綿鎳網（孔隙度 97%，孔洞大小 110 ppi）之中，如圖 8 所示，再包覆隔離膜即
為奈米鐵電極。此泡綿鎳網的功能在於支撐這些奈米鐵微粒，此外，也作為電流之傳遞通
 7 
如圖 10 所示。添加硫化鈉後奈米鐵電極的首次放電量有明顯提升的現象，由原本之 510 
mAh/g-Fe 增加至 650 mAh/g-Fe，這應是來自於硫化鈉使鐵的表面活化，使反應深度增加，
讓更多的鐵材參與反應所致。雖然首次電容量明顯增加，但其電容量也隨著充放電循環次
數而迅速降低，顯示添加硫化鈉並無法阻止奈米鐵微粒的聚集發生。但明顯不同的是，儘
管其電量因粒子聚集而下降，但最後卻能維持在 320 mAh/g-Fe 以上，這顯示儘管奈米鐵微
粒聚集成長，但由於整體反應深度增加，其電量亦較無任何活性添加物之奈米鐵電極提升
許多。

Synthesis of Iron Nanoparticles as the Active Materials for Iron Electrode 
 
Kuo-Cheng Huang and Kan-Sen Chou 
Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300 
 
Introduction 
Nickel-iron battery was first developed in 1900s and it has the advantages of being: low cost, 
long life cycle, and environment-friendly. The theoretical capacity of iron is 962 mAh/g. 
However, the iron electrode was traditionally manufactured from microsized iron particles, so the 
usage of iron was very low due to its small reacting surface area and the passivation on the 
particle surface. Therefore, only about 30% of iron was used, which equaled to about 300 
mAh/g-Fe in capacity[1, 2, 3]. In this article, we developed the synthesis process of iron 
nanoparticles and investigated the charge/discharge properties of iron nanoparticle electrodes. It 
is expected that the high discharge capacity of iron electrode could be obtained due to the large 
surface area and small diameter of iron nanoparticles. 
 
Experimental 
Synthesis of iron nanoparticles 
The synthesis was performed by mixing two solutions, named as Solution A and Solution B. To 
make Solution A, 4 g ferric chloride anhydride was dissolved in 50 ml de-ionized water, then 1 
ml of 0.01 M palladium chloride solution was added. To make Solution B, 6 g sodium 
borohydride was dissolved in 100 ml de-ionized water and placed in the ice-bath. Solution A was 
added to Solution B drop-wise under vigorous stirring. Black powder was produced in less than 
one second after addition of Solution A. To separate the iron nanoparticles, a strong magnet was 
used. The powder was washed by de-ionized water for three times. 
Preparation of iron electrode and test of iron electrode capacity 
The iron electrode was composed of 1.3 g iron nanoparticles and 0.26 g carbon black. In order 
to disperse the carbon black well, it was mixed with 0.26 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (M.W. 40,000) 
in 100 ml 10% sodium hydroxide solution. Iron nanoparticles were added in the solution and then 
agitated by ultrasonic and homogenizer. Centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min was performed to 
separate the materials from this solution. The precipitate was stuffed in the nickel foam to make 
iron electrode. In the experiment with sodium sulfide addition, extra 2 ml of 10% sodium sulfide 
nonahydrate solution was added to the precipitate. 
A complete battery composed of nickel hydroxide cathode and iron anode was used to 
determine the capacity of iron electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 7 M potassium hydroxide 
solution and 1 M lithium hydroxide solution. The capacity test was performed by the battery

Results and discussion 
The conditions of iron reducing were shown in Figure 1 and 2. When the temperature was 
lower than 1000 , the reduction reaction was not completed in two hours, but when the ℃
temperature raised to 1100  some iron particles were sintered therefore decrease the capacity. ℃
The reaction time is another important factor, from 1hour to 2 hours the capacity didn’t has much 
different when it over 3 hours more particles sintered and the capacity decreased. The XRD 
analysis of reduced iron is shown in figure 3.

Abstract 
Iron nanoparticles that were synthesized by chemical reduction were used as the active 
material at the electrode, followed by measurement of their capacity during discharge/charge 
cycles. The discharge capacity of the first cycle was extremely high, 510 mAh/g-Fe, at a current 
density of 200 mA/g-Fe, indicating a marked increase in the capacity and the output current of 
iron electrodes when nanoparticles of iron, instead of micron-sized particles were used as the 
active materials. However, this capacity deteriorated rapidly during the discharge/charge cycles, 
while the size of iron nanoparticles increased, suggesting that the dissolution and 
re-crystallization of iron could have occurred during these cycles. A good correlation was found 
between the capacities and the surface areas of iron nanoparticles following each cycle. Our 
result further demonstrated that the capacity depends only on the surface area of iron particles, 
varying by 30 mAh with every 1 m2 of iron. 
 
Key words: iron nanoparticle, iron electrode, nickel-iron battery 
 
1. Introduction 
Developed in the 1900s, nickel-iron battery has the merits of low cost, a long life cycle, safety 
of use, and environmental friendliness. For safety and environmental reasons, the nickel-iron 
battery is a promising alternative energy source for electric vehicles. A nickel-iron battery 
comprises nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) as the cathode and metallic iron as the anode. The 
theoretical capacity for the two electron oxidation of the iron electrode is as high as 962 
mAh/g-Fe. However, traditional iron electrodes only have a capacity of lower than 350 mAh/g-Fe, 
which fact is a critical problem in commercial applications of Ni-Fe batteries. 
Improving the utilization of iron particles is of priority concern when attempted to increase the 
capacity of iron electrodes. Iron electrodes made by sintering typically have a higher capacity 
than those make by pressing iron particles, because they have greater porosity, and consequently 
greater contacts between the iron particles to the electrolyte. Passivation of the iron particle 
surface is another problem in limiting the capacity of iron electrodes. Therefore, sulfide additives 
are usually added to activate the particle surfaces in iron electrodes [1-5]. Yet, even after these 
treatments, the utilization of iron particles remained under 30 %. Restated, only a thin layer of 
 17
Since performing an in-situ analysis of the microstructure of iron nanoparticles during capacity 
measurement is impossible, iron electrodes must be disassembled after various cycles to collect 
samples for analysis. After a certain discharge/charge cycle, the iron nanoparticle electrode was 
immersed in the de-ionized water and then ultrasonicated to separate the iron nanoparticles from 
the nickel foam. The iron nanoparticles were washed using de-ionized water for three times and 
then using acetone another three times. The iron nanoparticles were dried at room temperature for 
further analysis.  
 
2.4 Characterization 
The morphology of iron nanoparticles was observed by the scanning electron microscope 
(SEM; S-4700, Hitachi, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD; UD-3000, Scintag, USA) was performed 
to determine the crystal structure of iron nanoparticles. The specific surface area of iron 
nanoparticles was determined using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method (ASAP 2000, 
Micrometrics, USA). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Synthesis of iron nanoparticles 
Figure 1(a) presents the morphology of synthesized iron nanoparticles. Most of the primary 
particles have diameters of between 30 nm and 70 nm, but they are connected in chains because 
of the slight magnetic attraction among them. Similar results have been presented elsewhere [6-8]. 
The specific surface area (BET) of these iron nanoparticles was 25.3 m2/g, which approximately 
corresponds to the sizes from microscopy observation. The XRD analysis shown in Fig. 1(b) 
indicates that the nanoparticles are almost amorphous with a very weak characteristic peak of 
α-phase iron, suggesting the metallic nature of the nanoparticles. This result agrees closely with 
those elsewhere [8, 9]. 
 
3.2 Discharge properties of iron nanoparticles 
As shown in Fig. 2(a), the iron nanoparticles exhibited a remarkable discharge capacity of 510 
mAh/g-Fe during the first discharge at a high current density of 200 mA/g-Fe. When iron 
nanoparticles were the active materials, the capacity was significantly higher than that of the 
traditional iron electrodes that are referred in Table 1. This increase in capacity can be mainly 
attributed to the large surface area of iron nanoparticles, because no additive was used. A higher 
capacity is expected when additives are included. Relating work is underway. 
Another possible explanation for the high capacity of iron nanoparticle electrode is the large 
porosity of the iron nanoparticle electrode. Since the iron nanoparticles were connected in chains, 
the high aspect ratio of this structure enables more contacts to be made between iron 
nanoparticles and electrolyte, improving the capacity of iron nanoparticle electrodes. 
The output current density of the iron nanoparticle electrode markedly exceeded that of the 
traditional iron electrode. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the iron nanoparticle electrode retained a 
 19
area of 1 m2/g-Fe contributed to a discharge capacity of 30 mAh/g-Fe at a discharge current 
density of 200 mA/g-Fe when no activating additive was added. 
The intercept indicated a specific surface area of 8.4 m2/g-Fe, which was about 1/3 that of iron 
nanoparticles, not reacting during the process. This result may have followed from the poor 
conductive network of iron nanoparticles, since these particles were not subjected to any sintering 
before measurement.  
 
4. Conclusions 
Iron nanoparticles without any additive were demonstrated to have a high discharge capacity at 
high current density, because of their large specific surface area. However, this high capacity 
declines quickly with the number of cycles, because the nanoparticles grow by dissolution and 
re-crystallization. A linear correlation was established between capacity and specific surface area, 
showing 30 mAh/g-Fe for 1 m2/g-Fe of iron particles. More work is required to find ways to 
inhibit or to slow the growth of these iron nanoparticles to improve the recycling performance.
