Abstract 
One of the most important problems in this post-genomic era: to understand the biological basis of 
complex traits and diseases from genome–wide association studies; especially use single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms to intensively study gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.  This study is a three 
year research project which is divided into three phases: a comprehensive study of gene-gene interaction 
for binary traits; an extensive study of gene-environment interaction for binary; and a unified approach for 
detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interaction for complex traits.  
As entering the second phase of this study, the massive genomic data, single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP), can be acquired more effectively and efficiently. The number of SNPs can be 
genotyped from hundred of SNPs to hundreds of thousand SNPs.  As a result, the approach we proposed 
in phase I of this study is not performed effective owing to the massive data (noise).  Hence, in order to 
resolve this massive data issue, a series of experiment on the massive data we acquired from our 
collaborator were executed. Although the results we obtained were not significant and positively, 
they did pave a way to propose a new search approach for detecting Gene-Gene and 
Gene-Environment Interactions in Genome-wide Association by taking advantage of support 
vector machine and the computational experience we had been done in Phase I & II.  The 
proposed approach will be executed on the third phase of this study.

original proposal, the First Phase (one and half years) of these series study plans is to accomplish a 
comprehensive study of gene-gene interaction for binary traits and develop a Python tool.  
Meaning while, since the developed tool cannot be applied to such huge data directly, we are 
proposing some new approaches to this study and some preliminary experiments has been 
executed for the past few months which will be stated in the following sections of Material and 
Method, and Data and Results.  Though the some computing results are negative, it makes us to 
rethink the computational issues and algorithm designing from the other perspective.  We are 
hoping we can develop another validated approach based on the further coming computational 
experiments.    
 
Material, Method and Results  
The data, called GASP, under investigated contains 976 samples. There are 500568 SNPs 
located in 23 genes genotyped among 486 prostate cancer cases and 490 control subjects. The SNP calls 
at each site had been converted to numeric values based on the following assignments: 
homozygous for the major allele is coded as -1, heterozygous is coded as 0, homozygous for 
minor allele is coded as 1, and missing values are coded as 0.5; and individual control and case 
outputs are coded as -1 and 1, respectively.   
Owing to the massive data we acquired, the computational efficiency of LIBSVM becomes 
a problem to be reconsidered and the proposed genetic algorithm based search cannot perform 
effectively to find optimal combination of SNPs.  In order to resolve the encountered issues, a 
series of simulated experiments (combined with real data set) had been executed to check 
applicable classifiers and feature selection techniques.           
Firstly, 5-fold cross-validation (CV) of LIBSVM with parameters tuning was directly applied to the 
whole GASP data. The accuracy is low, 50.20%, and the results showed there was no any improvement in 
accuracy no matter how the parameters being tuned.  Since the poor computational efficiency of LIBSVM, 
(about 2 hours in Intel CPU i7-920), we also adopted another SVM, LIBLINEAR, to GASP. The accuracy 
outcomes, 52.76%, are similar to the one using LIBSVM, through it performed much higher computational 
efficiency, 20 minutes needed. Suppose there existed an interaction among a set of SNPs in GASP, this 
experiments showed us LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR both failed to tell the existence of such set.   
In order to exclude the aforementioned existence assumption and to understand the massive noised 
data effect, we designed a second experiment.  First, we generate two groups of data, one is linear 
separated (L) and the other is nonlinear separated (NL).  Each group contained three sets of pseudo-data 
with 3, 5 and 10 SNPs were generated consistently to fit the GASP data. In other words, these three sets all 
contain 486 cases and 490 controls, and their CV accuracy should be or near 100% tested by LIBLINEAR 
or LIBSVM themselves, respectively.  Those pseudo-data were appended to GASP to produce six data 
sets: GASP+L3, GASP+NL3, GASP+L5, GASP+NL5, GASP+L10 and GASP+NL10, and 5-fold 
cross-validation (CV) of LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR with parameters tuning was performed.  For the 
LBSVM, the outcomes of all six data are the same as the one of GASP, 50.20%, on the other hand, 
LIBLINEAR produced slightly different CV accuracy, but they were roughly the same, about 52%.  Since 
there did exist an interaction among a set of SNPs in appended GASP data set, this experiments showed us
