1 Abstract
To identify damping properties of materials, such as loss tangent, which are independent of geometry
and experimental methods, we have derived accurate equations of motion to model the behavior of a
cantilever beam under large displacements. And, multiple-scale analysis has been adopted to study
the weakly nonlinear system. Our model is a generalization of classical elastica theory. Moreover,
this model may provide accurate data-reduction method to obtain and scrutinize maximum stress
of the cantilever under the loading and clamping conditions with the consideration of the Saint
Venants principle. The current status of the resonant frequency device to measure the mechanical
properties of nano-structured, self-supported thin films through based-excitation vibrations is under
construction for an experimental chamber and stage. Key components of electronics for experiment
have been obtained. Hence, the resonant ultrasound spectroscopy device has been completed and
running. However, Labview programming is still under further development so that signals can be
filtered with a software-level lock-in amplifier to reduce noise. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy
showed the Young’s modulus of Sn was about 19 GPa.
Keywords: thin film, geometrical nonlinearity, cantilever beam, Duffing oscillator, resonance
2 Introduction
Mechanical properties of nano-structured thin film are summarized in [9] for its high strength
and high ductility. However, most current experimental results of thin film are obtained from
nanoindentation. There is a need to cross-check the mechanical properties of thin film with different
experimental techniques. A dynamical bending technique is a plausible one.

3.1 Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
The strain energy density of the beam, u = u(x, y, z), can be calculated as follows with Hooke’s
law, σ = Eε.
u =
∫
σdε =
∫
Eεdε =
1
2
Eε2 =
1
2
σε. (1)
The total strain energy is the integral of the strain energy density over the whole volume of the
beam, and with the curvature-strain relation, ε = −κy,one can obtain
U =
∫
Ω
udV =
E
2
∫
Ω
ε2dV =
E
2
∫
Ω
(−κy)2dV = EI
2
∫
κ2dx. (2)
Here we assume κ = κ(x). It is known that the stress-moment relation is
σ = −My
I
. (3)
And, the resultant shear and moment can be calculated from stress as follows.
V =
∫
σdA, (4)
M = −
∫
yσdA. (5)
The relationship between resultants shears and moments and applied distributed loads is as follows.
∂V
∂x
= −q, (6)
∂M
∂x
= −V, (7)
∂2M
∂x2
= q. (8)
To generalize quasi-static beam theory to viscoelastic one, we use the constitutive relation of the
standard linear solid, P (σ) = Q(ε) = −yQ(κ), and then Eqs. (4) and (5) become.
P (V ) =
∫
Q(ε)dA, (9)
P (M) = −
∫
yQ(ε)dA = IQ(κ). (10)
Here P and Q are viscoelastic differential operators.
3.2 Timoshenko beam theory
The Timoshenko beam theory is an attempt of generalizing the Euler-Bernoulli, which assumes
that the local slope of the beam is composed of two parts: an angle (φ) and a shear deformation
(γ).
∂v
∂x
= φ+ γ. (11)
3
M is the moment generated inside the beam to balance the couples from the internal force f . r is
the position vector measuring the beam. Note the beam is not subject to external couples.
Bending moment is related to the torsion angle of the cross section as follows. Assume area moments
of inertia, I, are the same along any principal directions.
M = Mξeξ +Mηeη +Mζeζ (25)
Ω = Ωξeξ + Ωηeη + Ωζeζ (26)
Mξ = EIΩξ (27)
Mη = EIΩη (28)
Mζ = GJΩζ (29)
The torsion angle can be related to t and dt/ds as follows, due to Kirchhoff’s kinematic analogue.
dt
ds
= Ω× t (30)
(Ω× t)× t = −t× dt
ds
(31)
Since (A×B)×C = (A ·C)B−A(B ·C),
Ω = t× dt
ds
+ (t ·Ω)t (32)
Observe that t ·Ω = Ωζ , twist moment along the longitudinal direction of the beam,
M = EIt× dt
ds
+ tGJΩζ (33)
Note that
d
ds
(M · t) = GJ dΩζ

(34)
GJ

ds
= (EIt× dt
ds
+ tGJΩζ) · dt
ds
(38)
GJ
dΩζ
ds
= 0 (39)
In other words, Ωζ is a constant throughout the beam. If there is no applied twist, the constant is
zero. Hence, for the beam under no twisting moment,
M = EIt× dt
ds

M = EI

The Euler buckling solution is therefore re-constructued.
3.4 Viscoelasticity
For a standard linear solid, the constitutive relation between stress and strain is as follows. It is
noted that τε and τσ are in units of the inverse of time. For the consistency of initial conditions,
one requires σ(0) = E0ε(0).
σ˙ + τεσ = E0(ε˙+ τσε). (66)
Assuming σ(0) = 0, The solution of Eq. (66) in time domain is
σ(t) = E0ε(t) + E0(τσ − τε)
∫ t
0
εe−τε(t−τ)dτ. (67)

The in-extensibility conditions ensure
(1 + u′2)2 + v′2 + w′2 = 1 (83)
For a point on the corss-section (η, ζ), by the definition of Green’s strain tensor, drp∗ · drp∗ − drp ·
drp = 2(ds dη dξ)[ij ](ds dη dξ)T , where rp = sxˆ+ ηyˆ + ζzˆ and rp∗ = (s+ u)xˆ+ vyˆ + wzˆ +
ηηˆ + ζζˆ.
11 = ζρη − ηρζ (84)
γ12 = 212 = −ζρξ (85)
γ13 = 213 = ηρξ (86)
All other strains are zero.
The Lagrangian of the elastica under certain assumptions is as follows.

The variation of work done by non-conservative forces can be calculated as follows.
δWnc =

[(Qu − cuu˙)δu+ (Qv − cvv˙)δv + (Qw − cww˙)δw + (Qφ − cφφ˙)δφ]ds. (89)

5 Viscoelastic elastica in two dimensions
It is known that the dynamical system of the elastica under the approximation up to the third
order resembles the Duffing system [11]. The convention of symbol usage is as follows. A super dot
denotes differentiation with respect to time, and a prime indicates differentiation with respect to
space.

With the use of Eq. (101), (104) and (105), δT can be expressed as follows.

(y′′y′2)′′ − (y′′2y′)′ = y′′′′y′2 + y′′3 + 4y′y′′y′′′. (113)
The equation of motion of a cantilever beam under horizontal base excitation is as follows.

Here ab indicates the base acceleration. If the material of the beam behaves as the standard linear
solid in the context of viscoelasticity, Eq. (114) needs to be modified as follows.

where
P =

∂t
+ τε, (116)
Q = ER(

+ τσ). (117)
The symbol, ER, denotes the relaxation Young’s modulus of the beam. It is noted that τε and τσ
are in units of inverse of time.
Let y(x, t) = a(t)φ(x) and take the weak form of the equation of motion by integrating it with
respect to its spatial coordinate. Then, the following Duffing-like equation of motion is obtained.

deformation into the results of elastica calculations, one finds it can bring the two predictions closer.
However, it is generally wrong by linearly superimposing a contribution into a nonlinear solution.
We have also tested the effects of number of elements that are used in the finite element technique.
It is found that when the number of elements is moderately enough, increasing the number of
elements does provide significant improvements on the solutions. However, there will be always
some differences between the finite element solution and theory of elastica due to the in-extensibility
assumption in the theory of elastica.
Figure 4 shows a typical result of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. In this case, the sample was
Sn in the shape of 7 mm cube. The peak corresponds to resonance in shear mode. It is estimated
that shear modulus of the specimen was about 19 GPa, in agreement with literature results.
7 Conclusions
The progress of the project is on schedule. In two and a half months of time since the project
started, basic governing equations have been reviewed and derived. Moreover, some solutions of the
equations are obtained for further numerical calculation to compare with experimental data. Our
finite element results have revealed the drawbacks of theory of elastica, due to lack of consideration
of shear and axial deformation. However, it has been shown a general consistency between classical
and numerical solutions. Since the funding of the project was cut for some reasons, it is difficult
to obtain necessary equipments to fully complete resonant frequency device. Hence, if my group
cannot produce experimental data, we are planning to compare our theoretical results to data in
the literature.
8 Self-accessment
According to what we have been done in (1) derivation of governing equation for the three-
dimensional viscoelastic elastica, (2) solutions of the weakly nonlinear Duffing equation to model
the behavior of the elastic, (3) development of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, and (4) complete
initial stage of developing resonant frequency device, we found ourselves on schedule in the project.
However, there are several points that we need to pursue and complete. (1) Numerical calculation
of the solution of the Duffing’s equation to fully characterize the nonlinear dynamical behavior of
the cantilever beam. (2) Correlation between theoretical prediction and experimental data. (3)
Inverse calculation from experimental data to identify the material’s properties of the vibrating
cantilever beam. (4) Possible control of nonlinear processes of the vibrating cantilever. Further
experimental work on thin film materials via resonant ultrasound spectroscopy is under way.
