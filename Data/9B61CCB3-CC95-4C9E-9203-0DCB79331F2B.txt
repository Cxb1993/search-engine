31. Introduction
The interferometer offers very high phase sensitivity in the measurement of very small
vibration. Interferometric method also permits non-contact capability of measurement,
thereby such method can be applied at the circumstances when contact method is unreliable
or at the place where contact method is inaccessible. Based on the small vibration signature,
the incipient fault of mechanical equipment can be identified and its future performance can
be predicted [1] or studying the stability of laser frequency under mechanical vibration [2].
In addition, the interferometric method is able to indicate the change of distance between
the cantilever tip of an atomic force microscope and the surface under test when the
vibration amplitude of cantilever tip changes [3], or determine the vibration amplitude of
middle ear for medical diagnosing the hearing capability by taking advantages of low
coherent light source [4]. Therefore, the design of an interferometer for very small vibration
measurement needs to take into account many factors, such as light source, modulation
strategy, interferometric configuration, signal processing scheme, so that all those factors
work cooperatively to minimize the noise from readout meanwhile maximize the signal.
Since non-contact interferometric method in the measurement of small vibration is an
important issue and challenging task for practical applications and scientific research, there
are many approaches were reported for this purpose. Sasaki [5] and Manojlovic [6]
proposed different heterodyne interferometer for measuring the vibration amplitude by
means of a lock-in amplifier. The common path configuration proposed in [5] reduced the
environmental disturbances and that proposed by [6] reduced the effect of reflections from
fiber-air interfaces. Park [7] designed a heterodyne interferometer with a balanced detector
(BD) and He [8] designed a homodyne interferometer with laser diode where the
wavelength was sinusoidally modulated. In former, the vibration amplitude was determined
by quadrature signals obtained from a 90 degree hybrid mixer where the driving signal of
acoustic optic modulator (AOM) served as a local oscillator (LO). In later, the first order
sidebands at modulation frequency was extracted by mixing the photocurrent with
5limited (QNL) phase detection [17]. Recently, a novel technique to achieve double sideband
suppressed carrier (DSB-SC) [18,19] based on OBD was briefly described in [20] where
the noise resulted from large carrier can be significantly reduced. Therefore, based on the
characteristics of OBD for high sensitive small differential phase detecting, and taking into
account the possible different reflections for different material under test, we propose a
heterodyne interferometer with single photoreceiver for detecting the amplitude of high
frequency vibration in nanometers range. The DSB-SC is achieved via OBD meanwhile the
interference signal is up-shifted to high frequency band through heterodyning. The DC
component of photocurrent is also reduced by allocating more optical power to the probe
beam, thus the carrier and DC induced noises are reduced simultaneously. In this study, the
DSB-SC signal is down-converted by self-mixing to baseband, therefore, phase control is
not required for recovering the vibration signal.
2. System description
The manipulation of polarization state of light wave is the key issue in the proposed
heterodyne interferometer, thereby detail descriptions of the interferometer configuration,
the photocurrent resulted via OBD, and the extraction of vibration signal by self-mixing are
given.
2a. Heterodyne interferometer
The optical interferometer for measuring small vibration is depicted conceptually in Fig. 1.
The horizontal polarization of probe beam from laser source is oriented to /4 relative to
the horizontal axis defined by polarized beam splitter (PBS) PBS1 by a half wave plate
(HWP) H2. Then the probe beam is split by PBS2 into horizontal polarized sensing beam
and vertical polarized reference beam. These two beams propagate to and reflect from the
mirrors Ms and Mr respectively to form a Michelson configuration (MC). The quarter wave
plates (QWP) Q1 and Q2, each transforms the polarization states of light wave between
7The minus sign in Eq. (1) arises from the fact that the resultant electric fields in
horizontal axis after H4 consists of two fields linearly polarized in opposite directions.
Once the amplitudes of first two fields in Eq. (1) are equal and interfere with the same
polarized components of MO beam, OBD is established. The differential phase between
these two fields is converted to the amplitude whereas the common phase, which includes
the common phase noise, remains as phase term. The frequency up-shift is also achieved by
heterodyning between fields with different optical frequencies.
2b. Interference signal
If the mirror Ms is pushed by a sinusoidal vibration force, then the induced phase (t)
picked up by laser beam is
(t)=s sin(t) (2)
where s =4πd/ is the modulation index, or the vibration amplitude induced phase shift,
d the vibration amplitude,  the wavelength of light source and  the vibration angular
frequency. Then the photocurrent isig(t) from PR is
isig(t)=η|EsigE*sig|
=ηPpb{a2[1-cos(b )J0(s )]/2+R/4
+a2[sin(b )J1(s )sin(Ωt)-cos(b )J2(s )cos(2Ωt)+ ...]
-a R [sin(

s )+2 22J ( 2
s )+...)sin(Δωt+ξ)+2cos(
2
b )( 21J ( 2
s )+...)cos(Δωt+ξ)]
+a R [J0(

s )J1(
2

-2a R sin(
2
b )[J0(

2
s )+...][sin(Δω+2Ω)t+ξ)+sin((Δω-2Ω)t+ξ)]
+a R cos(
2
b )[ 21J ( 2
s )+...][cos(Δω+2Ω)t+ξ)+cos((Δω-2Ω)t+ξ)]
+ higher order sidebands } (3)
9frequency up-shifted noise are suppressed, meanwhile, more sensitive measurement can be
achieved for smaller power allocation ratio R due to DC component of photocurrent is
reduced. Notice that the DC component of isig(t) is
isig,DC=ηPpb[a2(1-cos(b ))/2+R/4] (4)
even for zero vibration. This DC photocurrent becomes
i0=ηPpbR/4 (5)
as b =0. Therefore, i0 decreases if more optical power is allocated to probe beam. This
condition keeps the interferometer operating at near dark fringe condition, which is entirely
diffenent from that achieved by setting the interferometer at destructive interference [21].
Under small vibration (s <<1), the Bessel function are approximated by J0(s )1,
J1(s )s /2, and J21 (s )=Jn(s )=0 for n>1, then isig(t) becomes
isig(t)=i0{1+(as / R)[cos((Δω+Ω)t+γ)-cos((Δω-Ω)t+γ)]} (6)
at b =0, or the Fourier spectrum in complex representation

where A1= -A-1=as / R , An=0 for n≠1. δ(ω) is a delta function defined by the finite
time Fourier transform [22]. Equation (7) shows two peaks at ΔωΩ where the baseband,
carrier and its higher order sidebands disappeared.
2c. Signal demodulation and sensitivity consideration
The frequency up-shifted signal can be down-converted by means of mixing with a LO so
that the baseband signal is recovered. Since single photoreceiver is employed, we suggest a
self-mixing method to extract the vibration signal by mixing Vsig(t) with itself where Vsig(t)
contains only first order sidebands due to DSB-SC approach. The self-mixing automatically
maximizes the down-converted signal without any phase tunning, which is necessary if a
11
other parameters in Eq. (10) are determined.
Consider the performance of extracting signal from background noise, it is well known
that such performance is determined by SNR instead of the magnitude of extracted signal
where SNR is defined by the ratio of signal power Psig to the noise power Pn [23]. Moreover,
the sensitivity of vibration measurement is proportional to the minimum detectable phase
min , which can be obtained by setting SNR to unity. The variance of signal power at
output impedance Z of mixer is
Psig=[(GηPpb)2/SF]2(a Rs /4)4/(2Z) (11)
The noise power includes shot noise power Psh resulted from the DC photocurrent in Eq. (3)
following Poisson process, excess noise power Pex introduced by the random intensity
variation of laser [24], and electronic noise power. The characteristics of these noise powers
are statistically independent. Assume the DC in Vmix(t) is removed and the signal is equally
split before mixing and then un-correlatively added after mixing, thus the shot noise power
resulted from isig,DC but converted by transimpedance gain and amplified by DSB-SC signal
is
Psh=2qB<(a Rs /4)2[cos(Δω+Ω)t+γ)-cos((Δω-Ω)t+γ)]2>Gisig,DC /Z
= 2qGB(GηPpba Rs /4)2isig,DC /Z (12)
q the electron charge, B the bandwidth of mixer, < > the time average operation. The
intensity noise induced by laser intensity instability is considered common to all the laser
beams involved in the interference, thus the intensity noise is cancelled by OBD. Then the
ideal SNR of self-mixing is

(13)
The minimum detectable phase min is then obtained by setting SNRmix=1
13
and measured by a powermeter. An unamplified, high speed, DC coupled, battery powered
photoreceiver with low noise equivalent power is emplyed as PR.
To check the validity of DSB-SC achieved by OBD, the interference signals output
from PR as function of bias phase b at the same vibration amplitude and constant R are
obtained as shown in Fig. 4. The curves demonstrate the power of first order sidebands
remains constant irrespective of b as predicted by the interference signals in Eq. (3). The
carrier power is completely suppressed from-74 dBm down to -110 dBm is clearly
demonstrated. The curve denoted by noise floor is obtained by blocking the laser source
while all the electronics are still power on. The DSB-SC signals at different R under the
same vibration amplitude are experimentally demonstrated in Fig. 5. The DSB-SC signal at
R0.01 as shown in Fig. 5 is then sent to a mixer. The output spectrum of mixer is
demonstrated in Fig. 6 where the recovered vibration signal at 2Ωis clearly observed. The
first order sidebands at ΔωΩare also survived where baseband signal at Ωand carrier
disappeared as predicted by Eq. (9). The high frequency components around 2Δω, however,
are lost due to the bandwidth of mixer reduces to 80 KHz when the SF of mixer is set to 1
volt. For Pin=0.8 mW, a20.49, G=50 ohm and η=0.4, the vibration amplitude induced
phase shift s 0.14 rad is determined from the maximum power -86 dBm at frequency
2Ωso that the corresponding vibration amplitude is 7 nm.
4. Discussions and Conclusions
In this work, the OBD converts the sinusoidal phase amplitude into the amplitudes of time
varying signals and up-shifts the interference signals to high frequency band. The
amplitude of horizontal polarized electric field of reference beam and that of sensing beam
but oriented in opposite direction should be the same in OBD approach, this requirement
ensures the carrier and the basebands can be suppressed completely by setting the bias
phase to zero. If the amplitude difference between two electric fields can not be ignored, the

PBS2 and then retro-reflected from identical mirrors 
Ms and Mr respectively. Their polarization states 
are shown as (A) after double-pass the quarter wave 
plates Q1 and Q2. Such arrangement is able to 
collect as much optical power as possible from the 
probe beam. A phase modulation signal 
φ (t)= 0 φ + S φ sin(Ωt) is introduced to EPP by driving 
Ms by PZT at Ω/2π ≈10 KHz where 0 φ  is DC bias 
and S φ <<1 is the phase signal to be determined. 
The polarization states of EPP and EPS are 
re-oriented by H4 as depicted by (B) so that the 
horizontal components EPPP and EPSP from EPP and 
EPS at point (C) are in equal amplitudes but opposite 
polarizations. Finally, the total electric field 
ET=EPPP-EPSP+ELOP selected by PBS3 is focused on 
PR by lens L where

EPb and ELO are the real amplitudes of electric fields 
of probe beam and LO beam. Without loss of 
generality, the common phase shifts in probe and 
LO beams are lumped into α. Thus the photocurrent

----high order sidebands     (2) 
where A is the area of laser spot on the detector 
plane, η  the responsivity of PR, PPb=|EPb|2 is the 
optical power of probe beam, r2 =PLO/PPb is the 
power ratio of LO beam to the probe beam, β 
denotes a constant phase shift related to 0 φ  and Jn 
denotes Bessel function of first kind order n. 
Equation (2) shows complicate relationship of phase 
information S φ  with different spectral orders, this 
is due to the simple phase modulation along with 
the o-BD design. Moreover, the phase information 
is converted into the amplitude of each spectral 
order by optical subtraction. 
The first group of right hand side of (2) is a DC 
background of interference. If 0 φ  is biased to 2nπ  
while r2<<1 for small S φ  measurements, this DC 
background is reduced, which leads to the reduction 
of quantum noise and excess noise. The second 
group represents the baseband signal and its 
harmonics, they are sin( 0 φ ) and/or Jn( S φ ) dependent. 
Thereby this baseband signal and its harmonics are 
heavily reduced once the bias phase 0 φ  approaches 
2nπ and r2<<1 for small S φ  measurements.  The 
power of odd order of the harmonics, however, will 
be more attenuated than that of even order 
harmonics if S φ  remains constant. 
The third group of right hand side of (2) is the 
carrier signal component, which is dependent on 
0 φ and S φ . Since 0 φ and S φ are arguments of 
sinusoidal function and Bessel function respectively, 
the carrier signal is greatly suppressed as long as 
0 φ closes to 2nπ and small S φ simultaneously. 
The fourth group represents the sideband signals 
at ω ±Ω. The photocurrent of these sideband 
components can be regrouped as follow 
iSB ≈ ( S φ /4)Aη rPPb[cos((ω +Ω)t+ξ)-cos((ω -Ω)t+ξ)]     
(3) 
It is clearly observed from (3) that iSB is 0 φ  
independent under the condition of small S φ , its 
amplitude relies on the phase information and rPPb. 
Therefore, sideband signals at ω ±Ω 
resolution  
S φ = PbPq/8 η  (rad/ Hz )              
(5) 
at SNR=1 is found the same as the optimal phase 
resolution proposed by [8] under double phase 
modulation for dark fringe operation. Noted that the 
power of probe beam PPb plays the key parameter 
both in (4) and (5). In case of high power laser 
source or power recycling technique [9] is 
employed, the phase resolution can be further 
improved.
