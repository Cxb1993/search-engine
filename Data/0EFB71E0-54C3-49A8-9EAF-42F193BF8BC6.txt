Abstract 
Tumor vascularity is an important factor that correlated with tumor malignancy. The Doppler ultrasound 
blood flow signals have been demonstrated that associated with malignant tumor vascularization. 
High-definition flow (HDF) Doppler ultrasound was performed to investigate blood flow and solid directional 
flow information in breast tumors. The vascularization of tumor would be used as a factor to evaluate the 
effect of the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery. The aim of this project is evaluating vascular 
morphology from the HDF Doppler sonography to find out potential early predictors for good responses to 
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. In this project, three-dimensional (3D) B-mode ultrasound segmentation 
techniques are employed to automatically identify the 3D contour of breast tumors. A number of HDF 
Doppler ultrasound breast tumor images with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and pathologic proven cases are 
collected and then stored into image database. This study presents an efficient method for automatically 
detecting 3D contours of breast tumors in 3D sonography. Results of this project are expected to be helpful in 
developing a breast tumor vascular evaluation system for 3D HDF Doppler ultrasound.

due to the similar intensity of the shadow area and tumor tissue, contour post-processing phase analyzes the 
extracted contour to diminish the shadow area of the tumor. The proposed 3D segmentation method was 
performed in twenty patients. This study then compared the automatic breast contouring results with those 
sketched by an expert radiologist. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Image Acquisition 
The image database utilized in this study was collected during the period of July 2007 to August 2009, 
there were 10 benign and 10 malignant breast tumors in 20 patients whose ages ranged from 17 to 80 years 
(mean age, 44 years). Sonographic examinations were done by using 3D power Doppler ultrasound with the 
HDF function (Voluson 730, GE Medical Systems, Zipf, Austria). A linear-array broadband probe with a 
frequency of 6–12 MHz, a scan width of 37.5 mm, and a sweep angle of 5◦ to 29◦ to obtain 3D volume 
scanning was used. Expert kept a fixed sweep angle of 20◦ and power Doppler settings of mid frequency, 0.9 
kHz pulse repetition frequency, −0.6 gain, and ‘low 1’ wall motion filter in all cases. All obtained images 
were stored on the hard disk and transferred to a personal computer using a DICOM (Digital Imaging and 
Communications in Medicine) connection for image analysis. Each 3D imaging contained approximately 200 
2D slices, the spatial resolution of each slice was approximately 250 × 100 pixels. 
 
Manual contouring 
A sonographer with extensive experience in breast ultrasound interpretations manually determined 3D 
contours of the tumor by using two distinct methods. In the entire manual sketching (EMS) method, the 
physician manually sketches the 2D contour of each tumor slice. The partial manual sketching (PMS) method, 
which denotes the virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) [15-17] scheme within 4D View software 
(GE Medical Systems, Zipf, Austria) was performed to obtain an approximated 3D contour. The obtained 
contours were then saved in files for comparison with the automatically generated contours. The VOCAL 
scheme estimates 3D contours by a selectable degree of rotation. In this study, the selected degree of rotation 
was 30o, and the six preliminary tumor contours in 0◦, 30◦, 60◦, 90◦, 120◦ and 150◦ slice images were manually 
sketched. Figure 1 represents the tumor contour manually sketched with 30◦ rotation. The PMS method uses 
the six extracted tumor regions to build a 3D interested region volume. 
This study also developed partial automatic sketching (PAS) method, which is an automated version of 
the PMS method. The PAS method extracts six preliminary tumor contours by using 2D region growing 
method instead of manually sketched contours. When using this system, the physician is only required to 
select an initial seed point inside a breast tumor on the 0◦ slice of 3D sonography. The 2D region growing 
procedure began from the defined seed point and estimated contours for each 30o rotation. 
 
Image Preprocessing 
Figure 2 presents a flowchart of the proposed procedure, which includes image preprocessing, image 
segmentation and contour post-processing. Preprocessing is a important step before segmentation since breast 
ultrasound images always include noises, speckles and tissue textures that make contour segmentation 
difficult. Voxel nearest neighbor (VNN) algorithm, Wiener filtering and unsharp filtering were applied to 
reduce noise and enhance image contrast. The VNN algorithm, a statistical based approach, consists of two 
steps. The first step was to determine whether or not a voxel was located in a homogeneous region. Where N26 
(v) is a local 26-adjacency [18,19] around a 3D voxel v, Figure 3 shows the neighbors of v within 
  
Fig. 2. Flowchart of the proposed procedure 
 
Region growing technique is a simple and effective method of image segmentation. The underlying 
concepts of 2D and 3D region growing are identical. The procedure starts with a set of seed points and groups 
neighboring voxels or subregions that have properties similar to those of larger regions. Automatic 3D region 
growing method was used to separate the tumor region from background. Since the tumor diameter is always 
largest in the middle slice of 3D sonography, the proposed method uses the centroid of ROI area in middle 
slice as the initial seed point. The intensity property is used to include a voxel in either region if the absolute 
difference in intensity between a voxel and the seed point is less than a predefined property threshold Tp. In 
this study, the mean intensity of tumor region was re-calculated. Any adjacent voxel that satisfied the intensity 
property for the subregion was assigned into tumor region. The entire procedure was repeated until no further 
changes occurred. Figure 5 illustrates the results of the 3D region growing procedure.

Contour Post-processing 
The region growing procedure may include the undesired shadow area below the tumor region if the 
tissue portion and shadow portion in the tumor region have similar intensity. Contour post-processing step 
was needed to eliminate the shadow area and to retain the true tumor region. The specific properties of tumor 
shadows depended on the breast tumor contour. For example, tumor shadows are always slender and occur 
below the tumor. Therefore, the proposed post-processing procedure analyzed the height of the extracted 
contour of the tumor, which ranged from 70% to 100% and detected suspicious shadow area. Let two 
predefined thresholds Tr and Tc denote the maximum of row width and the minimum of column height, 
respectively. A shadow area is considered suspicious if the width for each row of extracted tumor contour is 
lower than Tr and the height for each column of suspicious shadow region is larger that Tc. Figure 6 shows the 
post-processing results. 
the contour determined by the proposed segmentation method resembles a manually sketched contour.

3. Experimental Result 
  Segmentation results were compared among the proposed segmentation method, PMS and PAS methods. 
Twenty pathology-proven tumor cases comprising ten benign tumors (numbered 1 to 10) and ten malignant 
tumors (numbered 11 to 20) were enrolled in the study. Image preprocessing was first performed to reduce 
noise and preserve detail information. In the VNN method, threshold Tv was experimentally set to 0.25, and 
the rate of enhancement contrast b was 0.9. The Image segmentation procedure employed 3D region growing 
method with the threshold Tp as 0.045 to extract contour of breast tumor. In contour post-processing, the 
thresholds Tr and Tc were set to 20 and 5, respectively, to diminish the shadow region of tumor. 
  Figure 8 shows the segmentation results obtained by the proposed segmentation method, EMS, PMS and 
PAS on benign tumors. Figure 9 illustrates the segmentation results for malignant cases. Figure 10 shows the 
segmentation measures, including SI, OF, OV, EF and volume ratio. The volume ratio is calculated as the 
ratio of the extracted tumor volume to tumor volume manually sketched by the physician (EMS method). The 
average indices of measure (SI, OF, OV, EF) on tumor contours from the proposed segmentation method, 
PMS, PAS methods are (0.94, 0.94, 0.89, 0.06), (0.80, 0.84, 0.67, 0.29) and (0.79, 0.75, 0.65, 0.15), 
respectively. Table 1 compares the assessment indices among the three methods.

4. Discussion and Conclusion 
Superficial measures and tumor contour information can be used for clinical diagnosis. The advantage of 
shape-based ultrasound imaging diagnosis of breast tumors is that it can be performed independently of 
specific machines. However, it relies on physicians for manual segmentation of tumors. A physician often has 
difficulty manually sketching the contours of tumors in a 3D sonography of many hundreds of two-dimension 
images. This study proposed an efficient method for detecting contours of breast tumor in 3D sonography. In 
the PMS and PAS methods, the six preliminary tumors contours were created manually by a physician and 2D 
region growing method, respectively. The Physician manually depicted the six preliminary tumor contours or 
offered an initial seed point for extract contour of tumor in breast ultrasound imaging. The procedure enabled 
faster tumor sketching compared to conventional methods. However, the PMS and PAS methods do not 
perform well for tumor detection. Because, when using the preliminary six tumor contours to build 3D breast 
tumor, the results of the tumor contour segmentation can substantially reduce the segmentation accuracy rate.
