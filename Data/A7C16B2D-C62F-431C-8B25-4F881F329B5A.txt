3Ng-Youn-Chen et al. 1994; Petersen and
Sauter 1999).
Lipases are widely employed as versatile
biocatalysts in the kinetic resolution
processes for obtaining optically pure
alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids
(Bornscheuer and Kazlauskas, 2006). Yet
very limited works have been reported for
their applications on hydrolysis,
transesterification, or aminolysis of racemic
proline, pipecolic acid, and nipecotic acid. In
the hydrolysis of (R,S)-proline methyl ester
using a purified Aspergillus niger lipase
(Ng-Youn-Chen et al. 1994) or
(R,S)-N-protected-proline methyl ester via
Candida antartica lipase B (CALB)
(Kurokawa et al. 2003), excellent
enantioselectivity was found, yet with low
enzyme activity for the later. Very low
enantioselectivity for CALB-catalyzed
transesterification of (R,S)-methyl
pipecolinate with or without the N-protection
was also reported (Liljeblad et al. 2002). This
drawback could be overcome by using
aminolysis to (R,S)-methyl pipecolinate via
Candida antartica lipase A in anhydrous
solvents (Liljeblad et al. 2002), in which the
very low activity was furthermore improved
with the addition of acetaldehyde for
performing the dynamic kinetic resolution
(Liljeblad et al. 2004). Moreover, very low
enantioselectivity and activity for
CALB-catalyzed transesterification of
(R,S)-methyl nipecotinate with or without the
N-protection was reported from the same
laboratory (Liljeblad et al. 2007). All the
results indicate that more studies on
developing an efficient lipase-catalyzed
resolution process for enantiomeric
production of these acids or their derivatives
are needed.
(R,S)-azolides as novel substrates for
effectively preparing enantiomeric carboxylic
acids containing anα-chiral center via lipases
were recently reported (Kao et al, 2012; Lin
et al, 2011; Wang et al. 2009, 2010; Wu et al.
2010). Inspired by this discovery, we extend
the resolution platform to (R,S)-azolides
derived from N-protected proline, pipecolic
acid, and nipecotic acid. As illustrated in
Scheme 1, the best reaction condition for
CALB-catalyzed hydrolysis of
(R,S)-N-protected-proline azolides is first
selected and then applied to (R,S)-azolides
derived from N-protected pipecolic acid and
nipecotic acid. Preliminary results for lipase
reusage and recovery of remained
slow-reacting (R)-1 are also addressed,
showing the potential of using the present
resolution platform for resolving other
N-protected-heterocyclic α- and β-amino
acids in the future.

2. Materials and methods
Novozym 435 as a Candida antartica
lipase B immobilized on acrylic resin was
provided by Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd,
Denmark). Other chemicals of analytical
grade were commercially available:
(R)-N-Boc-nipecotic acid,
(R,S)-N-Boc-nipecotic acid, and
4-bromopyrazole from Acros (Geel,
Belgium); 2-nitrotoluene from Fluka (Buchs,
Switzerland); methanol from Riedel-deHaen
(Seelze, Germany); acetophenone,
(S)-N-Boc-nipecotic acid,
(R)-(+)-N-Cbz-pipecolic acid,
(S)-(-)-N-Cbz-pipecolic acid, and
(R,S)-N-Boc-pipecolic acid from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); thionyl
chloride from Seedchem (Camberwell,
Australia), N,N’-carbonyldi-1,2,4-triazole
(CDT), (R)-(+)-N-Boc-proline,
5experiments of using higher substrate
concentrations of 22 and 103 mM for 1 at the
best reaction condition were performed.
Lipase reusability and (R)-1 recovery
In order to characterize the enzyme
reusability, the hydrolysis started in 10 ml
water-saturated MTBE containing 2 mg ml-1
Novozym 435 and 20 mM of 1 at 45oC. A
sample at 15 min was taken and analyzed for
estimating the specific initial rate VS(Et)-1. At
the end of 2 h, the mixture was centrifuged at
9000 rpm. The enzyme was removed and
washed via water-saturated MTBE for 15
min. The recovered lipase was then added to
a fresh solution to repeat the reaction for five
cycles. The collected solution including the
washed solvent in each cycle was analyzed
via HPLC, added to 300 mM pH 7 buffers at
4oC with stirring for 30 min. The organic
phase was then collected and analyzed for
calculating the recovery of remained (R)-1
for each extraction step.
Kinetic analysis
Unless specified, to 10 mL
water-saturated MTBE containing 3.1-103.2
mM of 1 was added 2 mg/mL Novozym 435
at 45 oC. The resultant solution was stirred
with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm. Samples
were removed at different time intervals and
injected onto the HPLC for analysis. From
the time-course conversions XR and XS, the
initial rate for both enantiomers VR and VS
can be estimated. The background and
acid-catalyzed hydrolysis was performed in
10 mL water-saturated MTBE containing 25
mM (R)-1 and 0-25 mM
(S)-(-)-N-Cbz-proline at 45 oC. Similar
reactions of adding 2 mg/mL Novozym 435
to 10 mL water-saturated MTBE containing
25 mM (R)-1 and 0-25 mM
(S)-(-)-N-Cbz-proline were performed. In
order to study effects of (R)-1 concentration
on the enzyme activity, the hydrolysis was
further carried out in the solution containing
8.7-52.0 mM of (R)-1 and 20 mg/mL
Novozym 435. The kinetic analysis was then
performed for 5.6-85.8 mM of 2 in 10 mL
water-saturated MTBE with or without
adding 10 mg/mL lipase.
Model development
The balance equations for both
enantiomers in a batch reactor can be derived
under the following assumptions:
1. An irreversible Michaelis-Menten
mechanism for both enantiomers leading to
enzymatic rates of VER and VES;
2. An irreversible water-catalyzed first-order
hydrolysis leading to background rates of
VWR and VWS,
3. An irreversible first-order hydrolysis due
to acid products leading to acid-catalyzed
rates of VAR and VAS,
4. A linear irreversible enzyme inhibition
from (S)-acid product when hydrolyzing the
slow-reacting (R)-1,2,4-triazolide.

Notations (PI) and (SI), I = R and S, represent
the acid and substrate concentrations, with kA
and kW as the kinetic constants for
acid-catalyzed and background hydrolysis,
and k2I and KmI as those for lipase-catalyzed
hydrolysis, respectively. Moreover, (SR)0,
(SS)0, and (PSM) represent initial (SR) and (SS),
and the maximum (PS) on deactivating the
lipase for hydrolyzing the (R)-1,2,4-triazolide.
It is stressed that the terms adhering to VAR,
VER, and VAS are not negative. Therefore, only
VWS and VAS in Eq. (1) are considered when
(PS) is higher than (PSM).
The parameters kA, kW, and (PSM) are first
determined from the experiments by using a
7Michaelis-Menten or ping-pong mechanism.
The opposite behavior for XR at a specific
time can be attributed to the higher
concentration of (S)-acid that acts as a
non-enantioselective catalyst for (R)-1. This
is not advantageous for obtaining (S)-acid of
high optical purity. Fortunately, the
hydrolysis should stop within few hours
when all (S)-1 has converted to the product.
Of course, the contribution from
non-enantioselective and background
hydrolysis can suppress when more enzyme
mass are employed at high substrate
concentrations (Wu et al., 2012).
Effects of water content, solvent, and
temperature for 5-10
Table 2 demonstrates the hydrolysis of
(R,S)-azolides derived from N-protected
pipecolic acid (5-8) and nipecotic acid (9, 10)
at various reaction conditions. In comparison
with 1, 2 and 4 in Table 1, very similar
kinetic behaviors of giving excellent apparent
enantioselectivity (VSVR-1 > 100) for 5-7 in
anhydrous MTBE are shown, where 5
containing Cbz and 1,2,4-triazole groups has
the highest VS(Et)-1. The pyrrolidine moiety
in the acyl part of 1, 2 and 4 is inferior to
yield lower specific initial rates when
comparing those of 5, 6 and 7 containing a
piperidine moiety.
A change of the reaction medium to
water-saturated MTBE has resulted in
decreasing of the specific initial rate mainly
for the fast-reacting enantiomer, and hence
the enantioselectivity. By further replacing
the water-saturated MTBE with IPE or CYC,
improvements of the specific initial rate but
not enantioselectivity for 7 are shown. On the
basis of the highest activity and
enantioselectivity, the best substrate of 5 was
selected. A similar kinetic behavior for 5
(Table 2) as that for 1 (Table 1) is also
perceived when varying the temperature. By
considering the highest activity and
enantioselectivity, the same best reaction
condition for 1 was selected for preparing
optically pure N-Cbz-pipecolic acid. In
comparison with the low enantioselectivity
for CALB-catalyzed transesterification of
(R,S)-methyl pipecolinate with or without
N-protection (Liljeblad et al. 2002) and low
activity for the hydrolysis of
(R,S)-pipecolinates from a crude Aspergillus
niger lipase (Ng-Youn-Chen et al. 1994), the
merit of using the present resolution platform
is apparent.
The results of resolving 9 and 10 in
water-saturated MTBE at 45oC are also
represented in Table 2, in which the merit of
giving higher activity and excellent
enantioselectivity (VRVS-1 > 100) for the
former is perceived. Changing of
water-saturated solvent form MTBE to IPE
or CYC does not ameliorate the enzyme
performance. In comparison with the low
activity and enantioselectivity for
CALB-catalyzed transesterification of
(R,S)-methyl nipecotinate with or without
N-protection (Liljeblad et al. 2007), the merit
of using the present resolution platform is
concluded.
Enzyme reusability and (R)-1 recovery
The enzyme reusability is very important
for the future application of present
resolution platform. The typical example for
the repeated lipase usage each for 2 h in the
best reaction condition for 1 was investigated.
As represented in Table 3, the specific initial
rate of VS(Et)-1 decreases from 16.6 to 14.0
mmol h-1 g-1 with ees from 100% to 98.2% at
the fifth cycle. The slight decrease of lipase
activity may be due to the loss of recovered
enzyme at each cycle. More than 89.1%
recovery of remained (R)-1 for each
extraction step via pH 7 phosphate buffers is
obtainable.
Kinetic analysis for 1
Figure 2 illustrates effects of varying the
substrate concentration on the time-course
conversions in water-saturated MTBE at 45
oC. In general, the fast-reacting (S)-1 will
rapidly deplete within two hours for all cases.
Moreover at a specific time, a high
conversion of XS is obtainable when
decreasing the initial substrate concentration.
The typical kinetic behavior is attributed to
the enzyme following the Michaelis-Menten
9the slight increase of XR can be attributed to
the enzyme on adsorbing more (S)-acid
product in the active site for decreasing the
acid-catalyzed and enzymatic hydrolysis for
(R)-1.
Kinetic analysis for 5
Figure 7 illustrates the time-course
conversions varied with the initial substrate
concentration in water-saturated MTBE at 45
oC. Very similar kinetic behaviors for (R)-5
and (S)-5 with those for (R)-1 and (S)-1 (Fig.
1) are perceived. This implies that the
acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is not negligible
when performing the hydrolysis of (R)-5. The
specific initial rate for each enantiomer is
estimated and represented in Fig. 8, where a
monotonous increase of VS/(Et), but not
VR/(Et), is also demonstrated.
An experiment without adding the lipase
and (S)-acid has been carried out (data not
shown) for estimating kW = 1.80x10-3 h-1. For
simplicity, the experimental data of VR/(Et)
varied with initial (SR) in Fig. 8 were
employed for estimating kA = 3.28x10-4 mM-1
h-1 and (PSM) = 1.83 mM via Eq. (1).
Similarly by neglecting the background and
acid-catalyzed hydrolysis for VS/(Et), the
kinetic constants k2S/KmS and [KmR-1 + KmS-1]
and hence k2S and KmS (or KmR) were obtained
by further assuming the same
Michaelis-Menten constants (Table 2). An
experiment as described in Fig. 7 for the
initial substrate concentration of (R)-5 equal
to 3 mM was carried out (data not shown),
with which the initial specific activity VR/(Et),
and hence VER/(Et) = 3.26x10-3 mmol/g h,
were estimated to determine the kinetic
constant k2S = 39.1 mmol/g h from Eq. (2).
Agreements of VR/(Et) and VS/(Et) between
the experimental data and best-fit results are
shown in Fig. 8. The theoretical time-course
variations were solved by applying a
fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical method
for Eqs. (1)-(4). In general, quantitative
agreements between the experimental data
and theoretical results are found, although
some deviations for XR at the longer reaction
time occur. Fortunately, the reaction within
few hours should be stopped when (S)-5 has
all converted to the product.
4. Conclusion
In the Candida antartica lipase
B-catalyzed hydrolysis of (R,S)-azolides
derived from (R,S)-N-protected proline in
water-saturated MTBE, high enzyme activity
with excellent enantioselectivity (VSVR-1 >
100) for (R,S)-N-Cbz-proline 1,2,4-triazolide
(1) and (R,S)-N-Cbz-proline
4-bromopyrazolide (2) was exploited in
comparison with their corresponding methyl
ester analogue (3). Changing of the substrate
structure, water content, solvent, and
temperature was found to have profound
influences on the lipase performance. On the
basis of enzyme activity and
enantioselectivity and solvent boiling point,
the best reaction condition of using 1 as the
substrate in water-saturated MTBE at 45oC
was selected and further employed for the
successful resolution of
(R,S)-N-Cbz-pipecolic 1,2,4-triazolide (5)
and (R,S)-N-Boc-nipecotic 1,2,4-triazolide
(9). Moreover more than 89.1% recovery of
remained (R)-1 is obtainable in five cycles of
enzyme reusage, when pH 7 phosphate
buffers were employed as the extract at 4oC.
A thorough kinetic analysis for
CALB-catalyzed hydrolytic resolution of
(R,S)-N-Cbz-proline 1,2,4-triazolide and
(R,S)-N-Cbz-pipecolic 1,2,4-triazolide in
water-saturated MTBE at 45 oC is carried out,
in which effects of non-enantioselective
hydrolysis from acid products and
background water as well as enzyme
inhibition from (S)-acid product for
hydrolyzing (R)-1,2,4-triazolide are
considered.
