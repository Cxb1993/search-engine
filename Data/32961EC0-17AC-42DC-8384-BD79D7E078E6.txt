3effect of the morphological change in the wall structure on the hollow fiber will be investigated.
Finally, the focus is on the treatment conditions, the effect of the AHCFs on the morphological
structure and properties will be studied. The resulting fibers will be packed into mini-modules
for studying the separation performance. These modules will also be used for filtering
middle-molecules from blood to benefit acute uremic patients.
Literature review
The PAN hollow fiber membranes has been developed with emphasis on separability, and
various morphology structures have been proposed according to the desired purposed.
Historically, activated carbons have been used as oral adsorbents or as the constituent of
haemoperfusion columns to treat cases of poisoning, as they possess the ability to adsorb a wide
range of both organic and inorganic drugs and poisons. The use of synthetic polymer-based
carbons with controlled porosity and chemical composition allows the production of adsorbents
that can be tailored to target speciﬁc poisons and drugs. The production of an extracorporeal 
device containing these uncoated biocompatible carbons may offer an alternative method for
reducing the level of poisons or drugs circulating in whole blood, plasma or ultrafiltrate [5]. The
manufacturing of active hollow carbon fiber has four stages: the spinning of hollow fiber
precursor, the oxidation, the carbonization, and the activation. However, the fabrication of
hollow fiber precursors with both strength and elongation is always a challenge due to the
complexity of spinning process. How to produce hollow fiber precursors with desire structure to
withstand high pressures, plasticization and strength technique in various spun conditions have
caused significant attention among the hollow fiber precursor scientists. Many works on the
adsorption properties ，relative structure，and preparation techniques to hollow carbon fibers
have been peported in the literature [6-10]. Various hollow fiber membranes have been
developed and used in various applications [11]. And recently researches also have reported the
development of hollow carbon fiber with PAN as the precursing material. A previous study
presented the relationship between the structure of this activated hollow carbon fiber, especially
the pore size distribution, surface area, and mechanical properties. Therefore, the ACHF
necessary carefully to control the structure, practically use in gas separation applications
[12-15]. Our previous work showed that DMF/water plasticized PAN hollow fiber may be made
by dry-wet spun draw technique which had been stretched with an appropriate draw ratio of
external coagulant compositions. For example, the stretched hollow fiber was different in
appearance compared with undrawn hollow fibers, being generally take-up speed. These hollow
fibers were also tough and flexible, and showed excellent ductility in the hydrated state. The
potential of a range of PAN-based activated hollow carbons to remove of low molecular weight
metabolites (urea, creatinine) or even middle molecular weight VB12 proteins which are likely
to contribute to the uremic syndrome was studied.
Methodology
5area of ACHFs was measured using a BET porosimeter (Autosorb-6, Quantachrome, USA) and
a mercury intrusion porosimeter (Autosorb-60, Quantachrome, USA) at pressure from
0-400Mpa.
Preparation of AHCFs
The PAN hollow fibers were first oxidized in air under a load of 0.1g/denier at 230°C for 7
h. The oxidized hollow fibers were then carbonized at 1000°C for 40 min in pure nitrogen
atmosphere [12], and were then heat-treated in carbon dioxide for 40 min at a temperature
varying from 550 to 850°C. Tension was not applied to the fibers during carbonization and
activation. Table 2. lists the conditions for the preparation of these samples. They are labeled
as A, B, C, and D according to the activation temperature.
Adsorption of AHCFs
The AHCFs samples were soaked at a weight ratio of 100:1 in physiological saline
containing uric acid (15mg/dl), creatinine (20mg/dl), and vitamin B12 (5mg/dl) at 37°C. The
concnetrations of the adsorbates were determined periodically using an ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer. The absorbency of the AHCFs was calculated from differences in the
solution concentrations.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1. shows DSC curves of PAN hollow fiber precursors with different comonomer
composition. The greater the content of AN in PAN copolymer, the higher the height of the
exothermic peak in the DSC curve. It is believed that the exothermic peak is influenced by the
ability of nitrile groups to react, and changes in the actual height of the exothermic peak are
related to the number of nitrile groups able to react or to the ability of nitrile groups to react
rapidity [20]. Pure PAN hollow fiber (A0 in the Table 2) has a higher onset of exotherm at
approximately 223℃ and a higher peak temperature at approximately 268℃. The introduction
of a few percent of IA comonomer into PAN hollow fiber precursor (comparing sample A0 and
A4) greatly lowers the onset of exotherm and peak temperature. This is because IA comonomer
can initiate the cyclization of CN group. Therefore, the initial cyclized temperature of PAN
hollow fiber precursor can be decreased. When the content of 2-EHA comonomer in PAN
hollow fiber precursors (comparing A0 and A7-A8 in Table 2) increases, the onset of exotherm
and peak temperature increased. As the IA comonomer content is increased(comparing A1 and
A5-A6 in Table 2), the onset of the exotherm is decreased. This table 2. indicates that as the
content of IA comonomer increases the reaction rate of copolymerization decreases. However,
as the content of the IA comonomer is slightly increased, the conversion of AN for the
copolymerization markedly decreases, as shown in Table 3.
Drawing of hollow fiber precursor
Dry-jet spinning offers the advantageous ability to draw the spinning line to very small
7loss curve is greater. From the photographs, the length of the arc should be as small as
possible for the optimum orientation of the molecular chain along the fiber axis and width of the
arc gives an indication of the crystal size [21]. Generally, the better the orientation of precursor
fiber, the more preferred the orientation of its resulting AHCFs (see table 8).
Adsorption isotherms for ACHFs
There are many correlations for adsorption isotherms. Its adsorptive of uremic toxin such as
uric acid, creatinine, and vitamin B12 was determined, to serve as the criterion of the
applicability of AHCFs in the blood-purification. The results show that by elevating the
activating temperature and increasing the activating time could enlarge the pores, and increase
the adsorption rate and the adsorptive of uric acid. The maximum adsorption capacity was
obtained for the activated prepared by high temperature treatment. The growing process of the
pores in this process during activation as considered based on the changes of mass, pore volume
and surface area. In order to increase the pore size in the AHCFs, it was essential to increase the
pore size in the carbon before activation. Adsorption of static AHCFs, the figure 4 shows the
adsorption isotherms for uric acid, creatinine, and vitamin B12. The results presented in Fig.4
show that the passage over sample C and D brings about a sharp drop in adsorption
concentration levels as early as 15 min and that this continues to fall at 240min. It would
therefore appear that the difference in structure and morphology. Figures 4 .show the variation
in the adsorption amount of uric acid, creatinine, and Vitamin B12 with respect to time. Figs.6.
show the adsorption rates of VB12 on AHCFs. Since mesoporous is much more effective than
micro-macroporous adsorbents in removing VB12, the comparison of the adsorption rate of uric
acid and creatinine between AHCFs are more reasonable than that between mocro-
macroporous adsorbents. The similar reason for the comparison of the adsorption rate of uric
acid between micro-mesoporous adsorbents is shown in Fig. 4. The adsorption rates of uric acid
and creatinine on AHCFs are rather high at the initial stage (see fig.4, 5). The adsorption
processes achieve equilibrium quickly at about 45 min and 60 min, while the time for the
adsorption equilibrium of AHCFs on VB12 is about 20 min slight equibilium and the time for
that of VB12 on meso-macroporous adsorbent is steady 90 min equibilium. The results indicate
that AHCFs would be more applicable as sorbents in haemoperfusion than activated carbon,
although much work leaves to be done before AHCFs applied in clinical.
Conclusions
The introduction of 0.5 mol% itaconic acid comonomer into PAN hollow fiber precursor can
greatly depress the initial cyclization temperature. As the amount of IA comonomer is increased,
the reaction rate of copolymerization decreases. The introduction of 1.5mol% 2-EHA into PAN
hollow fiber precursor can improve both the orientation and mechanical properties of PAN PAN
hollow fiber precursor and its resulting AHCFs. The tensile strength and elongation of the
drawn PAN hollow fibers depends on the drawn ratio. The tensile strength of the fiber increase

Abstract
In this work, polyacrylonitrile-based hollow fibers was prepared in this laboratory and was
oxidized in air , carbonized in nitrogen, and activated with carbon dioxide into activated hollow
carbon fibers (AHCFs). Its adsorptive of uremic toxin such as uric acid, creatinine, and
vitamin B12 was determined, to serve as the criterion of the applicability of AHCFs in the
blood-purification. The results show that by elevating the activating temperature and increasing
the activating time could enlarge the pores, and increase the adsorption rate and the adsorptive of
uric acid. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained for the activated prepared by high
temperature treatment. The growing process of the pores in this process during activation as
considered based on the changes of mass, pore volume and surface area. In order to increase the
pore size in the AHCFs, it was essential to increase the pore size in the carbon before activation.
The adsorption rate and the adsorptive of vitamin B12 are higher than those of uric acid. The
isotherms of uric acid and creatinine are favorable, and that of vitamin B12 is linear.
Keywords: polyacrylonitrile, activated carbon hollow fibers, uremic
toxin ,creatinine, vitamin B12
1. Introduction
The detoxification in vivo is mainly via the metabolism of the liver and the urination of the
kidney. Damage to the function of liver and kidney can cause the accumulation of toxic wastes
inside the body and lead to health problems. Blood purification is a process that employs
filtration or absorption techniques to remove pathological components from the blood of the
patient to achieve therapeutic purpose. The kidney is a complex organ that, among other
functions, maintains the constancy of the internal liquid environment of the organism [1].
Artificial kidney systems have been used clinically for more than 50 years [2]. In recently years,
advances in dialysis technique have reduced the death rate of patients with chronic renal failure,
resulting in an increase in the number of patients undergoing long-term dialysis treatment [3].
The removal of toxins from the blood stream is generally achieved by using extra-corporeal
detoxification techniques such as, haemodialysis, haemofiltration, plasma-pheresis and
9inorganic drugs and poisons. Yatzidis pioneered the use of direct blood contact with activated
charcoal for the treatment of endogenous and exogenous poisoning [2]. Since then various
researchers have reported further clinical use of activated charcoal hemoperfusion for various
poisoning. PAN (polyacrylonitrile) is used in a number of industrial applications as a fiber itself
and as a precursor for carbon fibers [8]. Various workers have reported the development of carbon
fibers with PAN as the precursory materials [9]. Koresh and Soffer have made carbon hollow fiber
through pyrolysis for gas separation and showed high fluxes and good selectivity [10]. However,
recently development in inorganic hollow fibers represents a significant advance in materials for
separation and chemical reaction applications [11]. The major advantages of inorganic hollow
fibers as compared to polymeric hollow membranes are their thermal, chemical and mechanical
stability [8]. The result of this work is expected to lead to the development of a hemodialyzer with
the ability of hemoperfuser. This will be beneficial to the dialysis technology. Over the past
decade, studies have shown that patients with hypertension and hyperuricemia have a 3- to 5-fold
increased risk of coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular disease as compared to patients
with normal uric acid levels [12,13]. In experimentally induced hyperuricemia, the development
of pre-glomerular arteriolar lesions has been shown to result in reduced renal blood flow,
glomerular hypertension and glomerulosclerosis [14]. It is also known that antihypertensive drugs
impact the serum uric acid (SUA) level and patient outcomes [15,16]. Many diseases are related to
vitamin B12 deficiency, thus there is an increasing interest in the development of a suitable method
for their separation and purification. Polymeric adsorbents and activated carbon have been used
for separation and purification of the vitamin B12 [17,18]. Commercial activated carbons are
widely used as industrial adsorbents for separation and purification. The effective size of vitamin
B12 molecule is 2.09 nm, which is too large to access common adsorbents. Mesoporous carbons
with larger pore size and higher surface area should be developed and used for enhancing vitamin
B12 adsorption from water. On the other hand, in this study of haemoperfusion, preparing
mini-modulus AHCFs, has shown higher efficiency of the removal of low and middle molecules.
Furthermore, adsorption can remove toxins without introducing any other substances into the
blood. Therefore, haemoperfusion might have more advantages over other therapies in the
removal of low and middle molecule uraemic toxins.
2. Experimental
PAN polymer (ηinh = 1.1 dl g−1)was supplied by the Tong-Hua synthesis fiber Co. Ltd.
(Taiwan). The solvent, N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) was of reagent grade and used without
further purification. Water was used as the external and bore liquid coagulant. Each adsorbate was
dissolved separately in doubly distilled water containing 0.9wt% of NaCl. The initial adsorbate
concentrations used in this study were close the concentrations measured in blood of healthy
humans.

time and temperature should be controlled during the preparation of AHCFs in order to achieve
the desired pore size distribution and surface area [8,19,22]. With the increase of activation
temperature, the diameter of the fiber decreased due to the etching of CO2 during activation.
Similarly, the fiber skin became gradually porous with the increase of activation temperature, also
attributing to the etching of CO2.
Figure 1, B. shows the morphology of the AHCFs after activation with carbon dioxide for 40
min at 550 ºC. The cross section of AHCFs was similar to that of the precursor hollow fiber
shown in Fig. 1(B1) except that the diameter was smaller. The etching effect was evidenced by
the micrometer-sized pores on the surface shown in Fig. 1(B2). In Fig. 1(C2), the 650 ºC
activated fibers exhibited more pores and rougher surface than in Fig. 1(B2). This suggests that
the pores in the thinner region of the skin of the hollow fiber has been activated and sintered. In
Fig. 1(D2), when activating at 750ºC, the skin layer was already peeled off and the ordered porous
structured was exposed. Figure 1(E2) shows that the 850 ºC activated external surface to expose
larger and deeper pores. These micrographs indicated that the etching effect was promoted by
the increase of activation temperature. This observation agrees with the burn-off percentage
listed in Table 1. Activation at 550 ºC for 40 min resulted in a burn-off of 46% whereas at 850
ºC, the burn-off increased to 61% for sample D. The pore size distribution of AHCFs shown in
Table 2. Sample A exhibited the BET and PSDs to determined a small number of the
meso-micropores peaking at 10-20nm, and more micropores peaking at 2-5 nm. The majority
pores of sample A were macropores peaking at 70 nm and 200 nm. At 750ºC, the major
macropores peaks shifted to 90 and 280 nm, while those mesopores disappeared (＜10nm), the
peak at 3-6 nm became narror, and two more peaks of micropores at 1.5 -2nm were observed.
The results demonstrate to show that above 750 ºC, Vme/Vtol volume increased due to the fact
that after the sintering of the skin layer, the part of the graphitoidal structure were gasified by CO2
and those close pores were opened to evolved into new pores (see Table 3). When activating at
850ºC, the peaks below 5 nm disappeared, while the volume of mesopores increased with a peak
at 5-50 nm. This suggests that the more pores were opened and merged. In addition, sample D
the major peaks shifted to 125 and 300 nm, respectively. Therefore, the pore size distribution of
AHCFs depended on the activation temperature. Higher temperature resulted in more macropores
and less micropores. There are some micro-, meso- and macropores in the structure of sample with
a high degree of activation.
Adsorption equilibrium studied were carried out to determine the conditions for maximum
metabolism removal on AHCFs. The resulting values of K and b were summarized in Table 4.
The values of b for uric acid and creatinine were less than 1, while that for vitamin B12 was
slightly higher than 1. Thus the adsorption of uric acid and creatinine was favorable, and vitamin
B12 was a linear adsorption.
Adsorption of static AHCFs, the figure 4 shows the adsorption isotherms for uric acid,
creatinine, and vitamin B12. The results presented in Fig.4 show that the passage over sample C
