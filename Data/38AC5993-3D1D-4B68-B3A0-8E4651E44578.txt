Abstract 
Zr-C:H:Nx% coatings with nitrogen additions ranging from 0 ~ 29 at.% are deposited on 
AISI M2 steel substrates using a closed field unbalanced magnetron (CFUBM) sputtering 
technique. The tribological properties of the coatings are tested against AISI 52100 steel 
balls under loads of 10 N and 100 N, respectively, using an oscillating friction and wear 
tester. The wear testing results reveal that the Zr-C:H:N8% coating has excellent tribological 
properties, including a low wear depth, a low friction coefficient and an extended lifetime.

1. Introduction 
Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings 
are characterized by excellent mechanical 
and tribological properties, including low 
friction coefficients and a high wear 
resistance [1-6]. As a result, the literature 
contains many investigations into their 
basic physical, mechanical and tribological 
properties and their suitability for use in a 
range of practical applications [7-14]. 
Broadly speaking, DLC coatings can be 
classified as either hydrogen-free (ta-C) or 
hydrogenated (a-C:H). In coatings of the 
former type, the carbon content is provided 
by a single graphite target during the 
deposition process, whilst in those of the 
latter type, the carbon content is obtained 
via the use of an appropriate reactive gas in 
the coating process. Researchers have 
demonstrated that the adhesive and 
tribological properties of a-C and a-C:H 
coatings can be enhanced via the addition 
of suitable amounts of metal dopants to 
produce so-called a-C:Me or Me-C:H 
coatings, respectively [15-21]. However, 
the past decade has witnessed a gradual 
trend away from the use of DLC coatings 
towards carbon nitride films on account of 
their favorable tribological [22,23], 
electronic [24,25], optical [26], and 
 
2.3. Hardness and adhesion tests 
The hardness of each coating was 
measured using a nanoindentation tester 
(TriboScope, Hysitron Inc., USA) with a 
force at final contact of 1 mN. The 
adhesive properties of the coatings were 
examined by performing scratch tests, in 
which a diamond stylus with a diameter of 
300 µm was driven across each coating 
under a continuously increasing loading 
rate of 1 N s-1. The nominal maximum load 
was specified as 100 N and the critical load 
for each coating was defined as the value 
of the applied load at which the M2 disk 
first became visible at the base of the 
scratch track. 
 
3. Results  
3.1. Composition, mechanical and 
adhesive properties  
Table 1 summarizes the nitrogen flow 
rates used to deposit each of the current 
coatings and indicates the corresponding 
coating thickness in every case. The table 
also shows the elemental composition of 
each coating together with the 
corresponding mechanical and adhesion 
strength properties. In general, the results 
indicate that the coating hardness reduces 
with an increasing nitrogen content. Thus, 
the Zr-C:H:N0% coating has the highest 
hardness of 1463 Kgf/mm2, while the 
Zr-C:H:N29% coating has the lowest 
hardness of 429 Kgf/mm2. Observing the 
results presented in Table 1 for the 
adhesion properties of the various coatings, 
it is clear that the critical load is highly 
sensitive to the level of nitrogen addition. 
The original coating has a relatively high 
critical load of 63 N. However the addition 
of small amounts of nitrogen, i.e. 8 at.% or 
12 at.%, increases the critical load to 87 N 
and 84 N, respectively. In other words, 
nitrogen additions in the range 8~12 at.% 
yield a significant improvement in the 
adhesion strength of the Zr-C:H:Nx% 
coating. However, it is observed that for 
higher levels of nitrogen addition, i.e. 
20~29 at.%, the critical load falls 
significantly to a value approximately one 
half that of the original coating.  
 
3.2. Tribological properties and lifetimes   
In the wear tests performed in this study, 
the friction coefficients of the various 
point-contact wear pairs were continuously 
recorded under normal loads of 10 N or 
100 N. It was found that the friction 
coefficient curves associated with the 
lower normal load generally exhibited a 
low and stable value of the friction 
coefficient throughout the entire duration 
of the wear test. However, the friction 
coefficient curves recorded during the wear 
tests under a higher load comprised two 
distinct regimes, namely an initial region 
characterized by a low and stable value of 
the friction coefficient with an average 
value of µa and a second region 
characterized by a high, fluctuating value 
of the friction coefficient with an average 
value of µb. The lifetime (L) of each 
coating was defined as the duration of the 
first region in the friction coefficient curve, 
i.e. the elapsed time between the start of 
the wear test and the moment at which the 
respectively; and the longest lifetime: i.e. 
3418 seconds and 1366 seconds under 
loadings of 10 N and 100 N, respectively. 
 
4. Discussion 
During continuous wear testing under a 
load of 100 N, it was observed that all of 
the steel ball / coated disk wear pairs 
exhibited two principal wear behaviors. 
Figure 6 presents a typical friction 
coefficient curve corresponding to the steel 
ball / Zr-C:H:N12%-coated disk wear pair. 
As shown, the friction coefficient has a low, 
relatively stable value for the first 1127 
seconds of the wear test, but then increases 
and becomes highly unstable as the wear 
test continues. The stable region of the 
friction coefficient curve indicates the 
presence of favorable tribological 
characteristics at the contact interface 
between the coated disk and the AISI 
52100 steel ball, giving rise to a low 
friction coefficient and an improved wear 
resistance. Previous studies have reported 
that the formation of a thin transfer layer 
on the surface of the sliding counterbody 
reduces wear and friction effects in 
DLC/counterbody wear pairs [28, 29]. To 
examine the effect of the transfer layer on 
the tribological properties of the current 
steel ball / Zr-C:H:N12%-coated disk wear 
pair, the wear scars formed on the AISI 
52100 steel ball counterbody were 
observed at various stages of the sliding 
test. The SEM micrographs presented in 
Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the surface 
morphologies of the steel ball wear scars 
after testing for 600 seconds and 1440 
seconds, respectively. The EDS analysis 
results obtained for the wear scar shown in 
Figure 6(a) indicated an elemental 
composition of 38% carbon (atomic), 31% 
oxygen, 0.9% zirconium and 30.1% Fe. 
The high carbon content of the wear scar 
indicates that a protective layer has been 
transferred from the Zr-C:H:N12%-coated 
disk to the AISI 52100 steel ball 
counterbody. The transfer layer improves 
the tribological properties of the wear pair 
by providing a solid lubricant effect, 
thereby protecting both the AISI 52100 
steel ball and the Zr-C:H:N12% coating 
from serious wear damage. For testing 
times greater than the coating lifetime (i.e. 
1127 seconds in the current wear pair), 
Figure 6 shows that the friction coefficient 
has a high fluctuating value, indicating a 
severe wear of both the AISI 52100 
counterbody and the coated disk. An EDS 
analysis of the wear scar shown in the 
SEM micrograph presented in Figure 6(b) 
reveals that the carbon content is reduced 
to 14.7 at.% while the oxygen content is 
increased to 50 at.%. In other words, the 
results demonstrate that the transfer layer 
formed on the AISI 52100 counterbody is 
completed eroded, resulting in a serious 
oxidative wear of the steel ball.  
As shown in Table 2, under a lower 
loading of 10 N, all of the steel ball / 
coated disk wear pairs other than that 
comprising the disk with the Zr-C:H:N29% 
coating exhibit a low friction coefficient 
throughout the entire duration of the wear 
test. Therefore, the coatings have a low 
wear depth and an extended life. The 
wear depth of the Zr-C:H:N29% coating is 
the highest of all the current coatings under 
a load of 10 N and has a value around 4.7 
times higher than that of the Zr-C:H:N8% 
coating. It can therefore be inferred that a 
high nitrogen content yields a poor 
tribological behavior in the current wear 
pairs, and results in a high friction 
coefficient, a high wear depth and a 
reduced coating lifetime.  
5. Conclusions 
The experimental results presented in 
this study support the following major 
conclusions:  
1. The hardness of the Zr-C:H:Nx% 
coatings decreases as the nitrogen 
content increases. Thus, the 
Zr-C:H:N0% coating has the highest 
hardness (1463 kgf/mm2), while the 
Zr-C:H:N29% coating has the lowest 
hardness (429 kgf/mm2). 
2. The adhesion strength of the 
Zr-C:H:Nx% coatings is highly sensitive 
to the level of nitrogen addition. The 
optimal coating adhesion strength is 
obtained with nitrogen additions of 8 at. 
% or 12 at.%, respectively.  
3. The Zr-C:H:N8% coating is found to be 
the optimal coating for sliding against 
an AISI 52100 steel ball due to the 
transfer of a solid lubricant layer from 
the coating to the surface of the steel 
ball. The transfer layer reduces the 
friction coefficient, improves the wear 
resistance properties of the wear pair 
and extends the coating lifetime.
