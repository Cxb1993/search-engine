1. Introduction 
Data hiding [1-4] is a process to hide secret messages in a cover media to make them 
undetectable. The main goal of data hiding is to enhance communication security by embedding 
secret messages into an inconspicuous carrier and thereby transmit them to the receiver. Hence, 
embedding capacity and imperceptibility are two important dimensions of data-hiding methods. 
However, at present, another important, broadly researched issue is the reversibility of data hiding. 
In general, the embedding process involved in data hiding overrides the original data of the selected 
carrier, which cannot be restored at the receiver side. Reversible data-hiding techniques aim to solve 
these problems. Reversible data-hiding techniques [5-20] not only can hide the secret messages in a 
cover carrier but also can provide a lossless reconstruction of the original cover carrier after the 
secret messages are extracted. Reversible data-hiding techniques satisfy some applications that 
demand no distortion, such as in the military, medicine, high-energy particle physical experimental 
investigation and art. 
In contrast to data hiding, the goal of steganalysis is to detect the presence of secret messages or 
determine a steganographic method. Current steganalysis techniques [21] fall broadly into one of 
two categories: specific [22-27] or universal blind steganalysis [28-34]. Specific steganalysis can 
examine the presence of a secret message embedded by a specific steganographic algorithm or 
perhaps estimate the embedding ratio. Universal blind steganalysis is a meta-detection method in 
the sense it can be adjusted to detect most well known steganographic methods after training on a 
substantial amount of original and stego-media. In general, steganalysis methods that target a 
specific embedding method can provide more accurate and reliable results than any other universal 
blind steganalysis. 
In 2006, Ni et al. proposed a reversible data-hiding algorithm based on histogram modification 
[11] with low computational complexity and short execution time. Thus far, no steganalytic method 
proposed has been effectual against it. In 2008, Kuo and Lin [35] introduced a steganalysis method 
to attack histogram modification-based reversible data hiding schemes using relationship analysis of 
five continuous pixel pairs in an image histogram. However, their method only works on cover 
images with smooth histogram distributions. Therefore, their steganalysis method can only detect 
the stego-images generated from cover images with a smooth histogram distribution. However, we 
found that there are many different histogram distributions among a sample of downloaded images 
on the Internet, some of which would make the stego-images resistant to the Kuo and Lin’s 
steganalysis method. In this paper, we investigate the overall differences in histogram features 
between cover images and stego-images and propose a novel specific steganalysis method to detect 
the presence of the stego-images implemented with Ni et al.’s reversible data-hiding algorithm in 
many types of images. In addition, we introduced a histogram coding method to reduce the 
computation complexity of steganalysis. Through the proposed sampling and quantifying processes, 
image histogram feature codes are encoded. Depending on these histogram feature codes, the 
stego-images can be detected efficiently. 
 
2. Review of the Ni et al.’s Reversible Data-Hiding Method 
In 2006, Ni et al.’s reversible data-hiding scheme used peak points in an image to hide messages 
based on histogram modification. The scheme can embed a large amount (5-80 Kb for a 512x512x8 
bits grayscale image) of data while maintaining a very high visual quality for all natural images. 
The Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the stego-image, compared to the original image, is 
guaranteed to be higher than 48dB [11]. The hiding capacity is associated with the pixel number of 
the peak points in a cover image. Therefore, as the pixel number of the peak points increases, the 
hiding capacity also increases. Ni et al.’s reversible data-hiding scheme is implemented as follows.

3. Steganalytic Features Analysis of Ni et al.’s Reversible Data-Hiding Method 
In terms of developing a discriminator for cover images and stego-images, steganalytic features 
are the core of steganalysis. In this section, we investigate the differences between cover images 
and stego-images using the principle of exhaustion, and we propose four significant image features 
for steganalysis aimed at detecting Ni et al.’s scheme using histograms. The details of the proposed 
steganalytic features are shown as follows.  
 
Feature (0): The valley phenomenon. 
In this feature, a peak point appears in the portions of the cover image histogram that resemble 
gentle hills, such as Fig. 2(a), where the peak point is located at 4 with 10 pixels in a cover image 
histogram. A valley phenomenon appears in the corresponding stego-image histogram distribution, 
as shown in Fig. 2(b), where the bottom of the valley is located at pixel values 4 and 5. 
 
Feature (1): The skyscraper phenomenon in image histogram. 
Sometimes the pixel number of a peak point appears in the cover image histogram such that it 
resembles a skyscraper, such as Fig. 3(a); in this case, the peak point is located at 4 with 60 pixels 
in a cover image histogram. Twin skyscrapers appear in the corresponding stego-image histogram 
distribution, as shown in Fig. 3(b) at pixel values 4 and 5.  
 
Feature (2): The adjoined skyscraper phenomenon in image histogram. 
In this feature, the pixel number of a peak point and its (right or left) neighbor resemble twin 
skyscrapers in the cover image histogram, as in Fig. 4(a), where the pixel value of the peak point is 
equal to 4 with 60 pixels in a cover image histogram. Adjoined twin skyscrapers appear in the 
corresponding stego-image histogram distribution, as shown in Fig. 4(b) at pixel values 4 and 5.  
 
Feature (3): The comb phenomenon in image histogram. 
This feature occurs when a peak point resembles a comb-like structure in the cover image 
histogram, such as in Fig 5(a) and (c), there the peak point is located at 6 with 70 and 44 pixels in a 
cover image histogram. A valley-like phenomenon appears in the corresponding stego-image 
histogram distribution, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d) at pixel values 6 and 7. 
From the above-mentioned image histogram analyses, four significant features used to detect Ni 
et al.’s reversible data-hiding scheme are proposed. According to the proposed steganalytic features, 
the details of the proposed detection algorithms and procedures are introduced in next section. 
 
4. The Proposed Feature Coding and Detecting Scheme 
According to the different steganalytic features in Section 3, the features codes are separately 
generated one-by-one. For a given suspicious image, four features coding the data, which comprise 
the codebook, can be produced for detecting purposes. The proposed detecting step is as follows. 
First, generate the Codebook(i) for Feature(i) detection. Second, search the Feature-code(i) of 
Feature(i). If the Feature-code(i) is found in Codebook(i), the suspicious image is detected as a 
stego-image. If not, continue on to next feature detection step until all features are diagnosed. If no 
Feature-code(i) is found in the corresponding Codebook(i), the suspicious image is undetected. 
That is, the suspicious image is detected to not be a stego-image. The flowchart of the proposed 
detection procedure is shown in Fig. 5. 
The proposed detection method can be simply divided to two parts, namely, histogram features 
coding and the detection of suspicious images. A method for image feature coding is introduced in 
Section 4.1, and the implementation of a method to detect suspicious images is discussed in Section 
4.2.

Fig. 5. Flowchart of the proposed detection procedure. 
 
4.1 Histogram feature coding 
To digitize the information of features introduced in Section 3 to detect the present of data hiding, 
four codebook-generating algorithms are proposed. Suppose a histogram of a suspicious image S is 
denoted as Hs, where Hs(x) is the pixel value x in the suspicious grayscale image, x∈[0, 255]. The 
discrete image histogram Hs(x) is treated as a discrete-time signal. 
Image feature coding is treated as a digital signal processing procedure. By way of the proposed 
digital signal processing procedures, namely, sampling and quantification, valuable information (i.e., 
feature-codes) available for steganalysis is produced. The feature-codes coding algorithms are as 
follows; there are four algorithms for each of the proposed steganalytic features. 
 
4.1.1 The Codebook(0) coding algorithm 
Let C0[x] denotes the Codebook(0) of a test image. According to the characteristics of the valley 
phenomenon, Feature(0), the image histogram data Hs(x) is sampled using signal pair x and x + 1, 
where x ranges from 0 to 254. 
The valley phenomenon can be encoded as follows. If a signal pair is increasing by a threshold 
τ and (Hs(x +1) - Hs(x)) / Hs(x +1) ≧τ, the quantified Codebook C0[x] is set to 0, but if a signal 
pair is decreasing by a threshold τ and (Hs(x) - Hs(x +1)) / Hs(x) ≦τ, the quantified Codebook 
C0[x] is set to 1. If the absolute value of a signal pair difference is within the threshold φ and |Hs(x) 
- Hs(x +1)| / max(Hs(x +1), Hs(x) <φ, the quantified Codebook C0[x] is set to -1. Otherwise, the 
quantified Codebook C0[x] is set to 2. 
The Feature-code(0) for the valley phenomenon is present as [1, -1, 0]. The Feature-code(0) is 
used to detect the valley phenomenon. In the detection step, the proposed coding algorithm is as 
follows, whereτ= 0.1 andφ= 0.065. 
 
For x = 0 to 254 
If Hs(x +1) - Hs(x) ≧Hs(x +1)×τ then C0[x] = 0 
Else if Hs(x) - Hs(x +1) ≦ Hs(x)×τ then C0[x] = 1 
 9
Else if x == xmaxא[254, 255]  
If abs(Hs(255) - Hs(254)) < Hs(xmax -1))×ζ/2 && abs(Hs(254) - Hs(253)) < 
(Hs(xmax -1))×ζ/2 then C1[x] = 0 
Else if abs(Hs(xmax) - HI(xmax-1)) < Hs(xmax-1)×δ && abs(xmax - xmax-1) = 1 then 
C1[x] = 1 
End 
Else C1[x] = 2 
End 
End 
 
4.1.3 The Codebook(2) coding algorithm 
Let C2[x] denotes Codebook(2) of a test image. When the twin skyscrapers phenomenon, that is, 
Feature(2), appears in a cover image, as in Fig. 4 (a), an adjoined skyscrapers phenomenon occurs 
in the corresponding stego-image, as Fig. 4 (b) shows. 
A lower twin skyscraper is next to the highest skyscraper Hs(xmax) in the histogram. In this case, 
we assume that the difference ratio of the twin skyscrapers is lower than the threshold η, that is, 
|[ Hs(xmax +1) - Hs(xmax +2)]| / Hs(xmax +1)] < η or |[ Hs(xmax -1) - Hs(xmax -2)]| / Hs(xmax -1)] < η; in 
addition, the altitude of the adjoined twin skyscrapers should lower than μ% of the highest 
skyscraper, that is, [Hs(xmax) - Hs(xmax +1)] / Hs(xmax)] > λ or |[ Hs(xmax) - Hs(xmax -1)]| / Hs(xmax)] > λ, 
where λ = 1 - μ%. 
If the adjoined skyscrapers phenomenon be identified, the feature-code of Codebook C2[x] is set 
as in [2], where x = xmax; otherwise, Codebook C2[x] is set as in [0]. Therefore, the Feature-code(2) 
of the adjoined skyscraper phenomenon can be depicted as in [2]. 
The proposed coding algorithm is as follows, where η = 0.05 and λ = 0.15. 
 
For x = 0~255 
If x == xmaxא[2, 253]  
If abs(Hs(xmax +1) - Hs(xmax +2)) < Hs(xmax +1)×η && abs(Hs(xmax) - Hs(xmax +1)) 
> Hs(xmax)×λ then C2[x] = 2 
Else if abs(Hs(xmax -1) - Hs(xmax -2)) < (Hs(xmax -1))×η && abs(Hs(xmax) - Hs(xmax 
-1)) > (Hs(xmax))×λ then C2[x] = 2 
End 
Else if x == xmaxא [0, 1]  
If abs(Hs(0) - Hs(1)) < Hs(xmax +1)×η && abs(Hs(2) - Hs(3)) < (Hs(xmax +1))×η 
then C2[x] = 0 
Else if abs(Hs(xmax +1) - Hs(xmax +2)) < (Hs(xmax +1))×η then C2[x] = 2 
End

In addition, while rules 1 and 2 must be obeyed, either rule 3 or 4 must be fulfilled. If the features 
of the suspicious image do not conform to the above-mentioned rules, generate Codebook(1) and 
continue the following steps. 
Step 2. Feature(1) detection: If feature-code(1) is found in Codebook(1), the suspicious image is 
determined to be a stego-image. Otherwise, continue to the next step. 
Step 3. Feature(2) detection: If feature-code(2) is found in Codebook(2), the suspicious image is 
determined to be a stego-image. Otherwise, continue to the next step. 
Step 4. Feature(3) detection: The comb phenomenon can be indicated by three different types of 
Feature-code(3, j), namely, [1, X, -1, X, 0], [-1, X, 0, 1, 0] and [1, 0, 1, X, -1], where j = 1, 
2, 3. If one of these three types is found, the suspicious image is determined to be a 
stego-image. The three different cases for the three different codes are shown as follows.

values for FP. Assume the number of tested images is Φ, and the number of correctly identified 
images is θ. The standard definition of detection accuracy is the percentage of correctly identified 
cover and stego-images, i.e., 
 
Detection accuracy = θ / Φ. 
 
In the experiments, a total of 8,028 grayscale images were tested. The experimental detection 
results are shown in Table 2. The average detection accuracy for cover images is 91.48%; for 
multi-pairs data-hiding schemes with 1 to 3 pairs, it is 88.33%, while for multilevel data-hiding 
schemes with 1 to 3 levels, it is 87.25%. From the experimental results, the proposed steganalytic 
method is efficient at detecting Ni et al.’s reversible data-hiding scheme. 
We examined the images that were misclassified and noted that the histogram distributions of 
those cover images that were detected as stego-images have features similar to the features of 
stego-images identified above. A similar situation occurs also for stego-images; because of the 
diversity of images, some histogram features of stego-images may be resistant to our steganalysis 
method. Most of the misclassified images do not have obvious types or characteristics, which poses 
a challenge for future work. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Thus far, no effective steganalytic method has been proposed to detect Ni et al.’s reversible 
data-hiding scheme. In this paper, we investigate several different histogram features between cover 
images and stego-images and propose a novel steganalysis method based on histogram feature 
coding. Based on an analysis of image histograms, four significant steganalytic features are 
identified to differentiate between cover images and stego-mages. These histogram features of 
stego-images are characterized using four kinds of feature codes. Using the proposed detection 
method, we are able to distinguish stego-images from cover images with an overall accuracy of 
87.79%. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient in detecting the use of 
Ni et al.’s dating-hiding method, including both multi-pair data-hiding schemes as well as 
multilevel data-hiding schemes.

 藏密分析技術依藏密演算法來區分，可區分為通用型(或稱盲目型)藏密偵
知技術與針對型藏密偵知技術兩類。通用型/盲目型藏密偵知技術利用自然
影像與經藏密後所得藏密影像之間之統計特徵的差異，達到偵測的目的，
通常違背自然影像特徵，便會被視為藏密影像。藏密的過程通常都會改變
自然影像的特徵，基於這種特性，通用型/盲目型藏密偵知技術對未知藏密
法亦有一定的偵測效果。而找出影像的特徵作為偵測法的核心，便是目前
研究上的重點。而針對型藏密偵知技術通常為針對特定、某一種類型的藏
密演算法所發展出來的偵知技術，依據影像經依特定的藏密法嵌入祕密訊
息後，所得藏密影像之統計特徵作為核心所發展出來的偵知方法。通用型/
盲目型藏密偵知技術通常搭配分類器使用，經特徵取樣、分類器訓練達成
鑑別自然影像與藏密影像的目的。而針對型藏密偵知技術則是經特徵取
樣，依特定統計分析方法或偵知演算法達成藏密偵知的目的。 
 資訊隱藏研究領域，無失真藏密技術逐漸受到重視，儼然成為主流，惟針
對無失真藏密分析技術部份，少見相關文獻進行深入探討，因嵌入演算法
與傳統方式已有不同，目前藏密偵測技術已逐漸不符合需求。本計畫即針
對此一方向進行研究，著重於可回復式藏密技術，進行影像特徵分析，並
建構出具良好偵測效能的系統。透過藏密演算法的特性分析，從影像直方
圖分析藏密影像的特徵，分別提出兩種基於演算法設計的偵測系統。從實
驗結果分析，所提之方法具有優異的偵測效能。不僅在藏密影像的偵測上，
具有極佳的偵測率，針對藏密影像所使用的藏密金鑰，亦有極佳的估測能
力。 
 2006 年，Ni 等學者提出了植基於直方圖位移（Histogram Shifting）的
可回復式藏密技術，將像素值屬於峰點與零點之間者，往零點位移 1 個像
素值，創造出藏密空間。在不考量額外訊息的紀錄需求，其藏密容量大小
等同於峰點的數量，藏密影像具有良好的影像品質。其藏密容量約 5~80
Kb，藏密影像 PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise ratio)值約維持在 48 dB 以上。
本研究計畫係針對 Ni 等學者的方法進行藏密分析，並且分析 Ni 等學者的
方法對影像直方圖改變所造成有意義的特徵，並以特徵編碼法與設計之偵
測演算法建構藏密偵測系統。實驗結果證明，本研究計畫提出之藏密分析
法，可有效偵測其藏密之事實。
