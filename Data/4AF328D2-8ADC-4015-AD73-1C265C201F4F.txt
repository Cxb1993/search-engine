characterized as a function of applied potentials, hydraulic retention time, and pH, respectively.  In 
addition, the degradation products will be characterized to postulate the reaction mechanism.  Both 
carbon and chloride balance calculations will be conducted and the results will be taken into 
account when determining the degradation efficiency for each target compound.   
This report includes preliminary experimental results using 4-chlorophenol and quality 
control of analytical procedures as well as the operation of potentiostat.  Results from this report 
will be used to help conduct experiments scheduled for next year and increase the precision and 
completeness of the experiments.

(Gattrell and Kirk, 1993a; Trabelsi et al., 1996; Rodgers et al., 1999). Thus, electrochemical 
degradation of chlorophenols has been shown feasible in the bench scale.  However, electrode 
fouling and therefore, electrode selection is one of the major obstacles preventing this technique 
being applied to a larger scale and longer experiment.  Thus, the objectives for electrochemical 
reduction of chlorophenols are (1) to test the hypothesis that the degradation products of 
chlorophenols in water-based solution are a function of applied potential using granular graphite as 
electrode material, (2) to identify the degradation products of chlorophenols using this approach, (3) 
to test the hypothesis that the surface reaction rates constant of chlorophenols degradation are a 
function of the applied potential, (4) to test the hypothesis that the surface reaction rate constants of 
chlorophenols are a function of solution pH, and (5) to characterize the electricity consumption as a 
function of percent chlorophenols degradation.   
 
Experimental Setup 
Cathodic reduction of 4-chlorophenol (4CP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (24DCP), and 
2,4,6-trichlorophenol (246TCP) will be conducted using a cathode reactor with granular graphite as 
the electrode material.  4CP is selected because a previous study showed no observable reduction 
of 4CP when graphite rods were used as the cathode (Cheng, et al., 1997).  24DCP is selected 
because it is one of the twenty environmental endocrine disruptors listed and administered by the 
Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, 24DCP is included in U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s priority list of most common hazardous substances found in the United States 
(40 CFR 131.36, 1993).  246TCP are chosen because results of biological degradation of these two 
compounds are available (Razavi-Shirazi and Veenstra, 2000; Steinle, et al., 2000) and can be used 
as the base line for evaluating the performance of the proposed approach.   
In the beginning, only one compound will be used as target compounds.  At a later 
stage of the project, all the compounds selected will be used as target compounds in the same 
solution to evaluate the effects or interferences between the compounds on the degradation 
performance.   
Degradation of target compounds will be evaluated using a reactor with granular 
graphite as the cathode material.  The reactor contains two compartments separated by a Nafion 
membrane.  The anode (counter electrode) will be filled with granular graphite.  Power is 
connected to the reactor by inserting a graphite rod into the connection port of each compartment.  
A potentiostat (Gamry PC4) will be used to maintaining a constant current between the cathode and 
the reference electrode.   
During the experiment, solutions containing target compounds will flow only through 
the cathode and samples will be taken at the inlet and outlet of the reactor.  The solution matrix 
will be prepared by spiking de-ionized water with target compounds.  To minimize the loss of 
compounds due to volatilization, the solution will be stored in a closed glass reservoir with a 
volume of 1000 mL.  A peristaltic pump will be used to pump the solution through the system.  
Teflon tubings and fittings will be used in the system to minimize the loss of compounds to 
adsorption.

until September.  The progress of the subsequent project will be expedited to make up for the 
delay.  It is expected that the project will be completed on time.
