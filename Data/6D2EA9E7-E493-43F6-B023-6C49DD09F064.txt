 process (Toho) as well as by atmospheric plasma 
spraying (Siemens-Westinghouse) with scalable 
processes, most studies focus on anode supported cell 
structure because thicker anode can be designed with 
good TCE match to the electrolyte, and it has excellent 
conductivity. In addition, an anode supporting structure 
presents advantages in terms of cost, conductivity and 
mechanical strength. The anode support allows 
moreover for film deposition of the electrolyte by easily 
scalable and automated (high temperature) ceramic 
processes, as opposed to expensive and production 
limiting vapour deposition techniques (PVD, EVD) of 
thin YSZ employed at necessarily lower temperature for 
cathode supports. Although anode supported cell 
possesses advantages comparing to that of cathode and 
electrolyte supported cell, some disadvantages including 
high NiO content, lack of redox stability, low 
mechanical stability needed to be overcome for 
ultimately commercialization. (Moreover, anode 
supported electrolyte film can be prepared by easily 
scalable and automated (high temperature) ceramic 
processes, while cathode supported electrolyte film is 
usually prepared by expensive and production limiting 
vapour deposition techniques (PVD, EVD). Although 
anode supported cell possesses advantages comparing 
to that of cathode and electrolyte supported cell, some 
disadvantages including high NiO content, lack of 
redox stability, low mechanical stability need to be 
overcome for ultimate commercialization.). 
 
Various processes have been investigated as the 
manufacturing process of anode supported SOFCs. 
Among them, a wet-process is especially attractive 
because of its low cost and mass productivity. 
Co-sintering of electrolyte and anode substrate is widely 
adopted for this purpose. Although robust structures and 
high performances are reported [11–14], optimal 
information regarding every single component 
including the material processing/fabrication parameters, 
microstructure and composition of electrodes are 
limited to the material compositions made by individual 
groups. Considering the successful research progress 
undergoing in PEMFC and DMFC using commercially 
available materials (e.g. Dupont Nafion as electrolyte 
and E-TEK Pt/C as electrode catalyst) as a basis and 
fabricate electrolyte supported cell for performance 
evaluation [15-17], the aim of this study was to obtain 
more information about the contribution of co-sintering 
temperature to the electrochemical performance of 
anode-supported SOFC currently manufactured as 
standard materials of ESL Co. Sintering temperatures 
between 1200 to 1600℃ are used for evaluating effect 
of sintering temperature on the anode-supported SOFC. 
 
2. Experimental 
 
2.1. Cell fabrication 
 
Green films of the electrolyte tape (42400, 8 
mol% YSZ, thickness = 0.07mm, ESL Electro-Science 
Co. Ltd), anode tape(42420, NiO/YSZ = 30 wt%/70 
wt%, thickness =  0.07mm, ESL Electro-Science Co. 
Ltd), and porous anode tape(42421, NiO/YSZ =30 
wt%/70 wt%, thickness = 0.18mm, ESL 
Electro-Science Co. Ltd) were cutted to the dimensions 
of 40 mm * 40 mm. The three tapes were then 
laminated via hot-pressized at 1000 psi, 70℃  and 
stayed for 20 minutes. The firing profiles are as 
following: (a) first firing step from 25℃ to 650℃ with 
the heating rate controlled at 0.9~1.1℃/min. (b) second 
firing step from 650 ℃  to target temperatures 
(1200-1600℃) with the heating rate controlled at 3~5℃
/min. (c) third, the cell was maintained at target 
temperatures for another 120 min. (d) The final step is 
cooling. After that, (La, Sr)MnO3 (LSM) paste(42400, 
ESL Electro-Science Co. Ltd), which was selected as 
cathode material, was printed onto the YSZ electrolyte 
pellets, and they were fired at 1200℃ and stayed for 
120 min. Fig. 1 and 2 show the fabrication process and 
photograph of the anode-supported SOFC in this study, 
respectively. 
 
 
 
2.2. Density and surface area measurement 
 
    Green electrolyte/anode/porous anode multi-layers 
of these separated samples were calcined at 1250, 1300, 
1350, 1400, 1450, 1500, 1550, 1600℃ in air for 120 
min with a heating rate of 5 ℃ /min. LSM cathode 
paste was printed on the electrolyte surface of 
post-sintered electrolyte/anode/porous anode 
multi-layers and were fired at 1200℃. The resultant 
sintered densities (Drs) of the cells for both 
post-sintered and post-pretreatment were measured by 
the Archimedes method. 
 
 
where W1 is the dry weight, W2 is the wet weight 
(water in body), W3 is the body’s submerged weight 
without fine wire, and ρ is the density of the 
solvent(water). Considering the high volume and weight 
percentage of anode among anode-supported cell, the 
density change is primary due to variation of anode 
structure. In addition, the  surface area of anode were 
confirmed by BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) 
absorption isotherm method using N2 gas before the 
application of cathode layers. 
 
2.3. Microstructural characterization  
 
    The morphology of the anode surfaces were 
studied by means of a scanning electron microscope 
(SEM, model JSM-5600, Jeol Co., Japan) equipped 
with EDS. The anode surface was coated with gold 
powder under vacuum. 
 
2.4. Conductivity measurements

 4.5 g/cm3. The density increases further with increasing 
temperature to 1500℃ for a value of 5.5 g/cm3, about 
22% increasing. Apparently, there is a big jump for 
sintering temperature from 1400 to 1500℃. The density 
increases with increasing co-sinteing temperature was 
due to agglomeration of anode materials and become 
more pronounced for temperature higher than 1400℃. 
For co-sinteing temperature higher than 1500℃, the 
anode density drop slightly to 5.2 and 5.0 g/cm3 for the 
co-sinteing temperature of 1550 and 1600 ℃ , 
respectively. The anode-supported cell densities after 
pretreatment at 500℃  with continuous dilute H2 
flowing for 12 hr are also shown in Fig. 6. The trend is 
similar to that of post- fired anode-supported cells. For 
the fired temperature of 1300℃, the density is lowered 
to 3.2 from 4.5 g/cm3 due to NiO reducing to Ni. The 
density difference between post-sintered and 
post-pretreatment anode is about 1.3 g/cm3. For 
increasing co-sinteing temperature, the density 
difference between post- sintered and post-pretreatment 
anode becomes smaller. The result is easy to explain 
that as anode materials agglomerated with increasing 
temperature, the resulting compact anode structure is 
unlikely to for NiO reduction to Ni easily. Therefore, 
incomplete anode reduction concluded and less-porous 
anode structure resulted. 
 
3.4 Surface area 
 
    Fig. 7 shows the surface area of the anode 
after co-sinteing at different temperatures. The highest 
surface area of 5.9 m3/g was reached for the sintered 
temperature of 1300℃ and decreased gradually to 1.6 
m3/g for the co-sinteing temperature of 1600℃. The 
surface area decreases with increasing fired temperature 
was due to agglomeration of anode materials and 
primarily attributed to Ni. 
 
3.5  Conductivity 
In this section, electrical conductivity of anode 
sintered at different temperature was measured. The 
microstructure of anode changed during sintering 
process has been found from previous section, and the 
change will influences the anode conductivity and cell 
performance hereafter. 
 
As shown in Fig. 8, conductivity for co-sinteing 
temperature of 1200℃ is 137.369 S/cm and increased 
to 219.853 S/cm at 1300 ℃ . As the calcined 
temperature increases further to 1400 and 1500℃, the 
conductivity increases further to 350 S/cm and 470 
S/cm, respectively. The conductivity increasing rates 
are 83, 130 and 120 S/cm℃  for the co-sinteing 
temperature ranges of 1200-1300℃, 1300-1400℃, and 
1400-1500℃, respectively. Obviously, as the sintered 
temperature higher than 1300℃, the anode structure 
agglomerated greatly and resulted in continuous 
conducting network comparing to that of sintered 
temperature lower than 1300℃. The effect of sintered 
temperature on anode structure and its conductivity can 
be co-related by comparing SEM and conductivity 
results. The anode structure for low temperature (e.g. 
1250℃) is loosened and agglomerated largely as fired 
temperature higher than 1350℃ as shown in Fig. 5. In 
addition to the anode agglomeration primarily from 
YSZ, Ni diffuse and sintering easily and results in good 
Ni networking for better electrical conductivity [18]. 
 
4. Conclusions                                            
 
At this point of the study, performances are not 
optimized and low power densities are available, due to 
dilute H2 used and lower operation temperature in this 
study. However, co-sinteing temperatures are proved to 
have pronounced effect on the the fabrication and 
characterization of an anode supported cell. For low 
co-sinteing temperature as 1250℃, the electrolyte is 
unable to sinter fully and forms a porous structure 
which leads to a reduced open-circuit potential and 
poor cell performance especially under low current 
output. For co-sintering temperature higher than 1500
℃, the cell performance decreases particularly under 
high current density operation due to 
over-agglomeration of anode structure.  
Accompanying with SEM, surface area and 
conductivity results, an optimal co-sintering 
temperature of 1350-1450℃  is recommended for 
commercially available anode/electrolyte multi-layer 
for anode-supported SOFC to achieve acceptable 
performance.
