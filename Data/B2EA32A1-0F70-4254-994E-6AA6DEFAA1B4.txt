二、計畫緣由與目的 
近年來，由於半導體元件的微小化趨
勢，已經使得電子科技快速的發展，而具有
較 佳 的 介 電 性 (dielectric) 、 電 光 性
(electric-optic)、壓電性(piezoelectric)、焦電
性(pyroelectric)和非線性光學性質(nonlinear 
optic properties)的鐵電薄膜技術及相關元件
的開發，已經成為重要的研究發展方向。 
頻率的控制在共振器元件是一項重要
的因子，串聯和並聯共振器的頻率直接影響
到濾波器的頻寬大小，而且頻率的調整亦會
使Q值(品質因素)或是Return loss(插入損失)
變差，如何使頻率的調整與 FBAR 的其他特
性之間取得一個最佳參數，是本研究計畫的
重點，因此發展頻率控制的 FBAR 製程是一
項重要的研究課題，此研究成果將對高頻通
訊的品質具有極大的貢獻；本研究採用質量
負載效應作為 FBAR 的頻率控制。 
在材料的選擇上，壓電層材料採用具有
優異壓電特性的AlN薄膜，布拉格反射層則
採用Mo/SiO2的組合，其中Mo為高聲阻抗材
料(ZMo=64.2*106kg/m2sec)，而且其與AlN之
晶格常數相當匹配，常用於體聲波元件之
中 ； 而 SiO2 為 低 聲 阻 抗 之 材 料 
(ZSiO2=13.5*10
6kg/m2sec)，其化學特性穩定
且薄膜緻密而平整，十分適合製作多層的布
拉格反射層；此外，布拉格反射層高聲阻抗
材 料 與 低 聲 阻 抗 材 料 之 聲 阻 抗 比 值
(Impedance ratio)愈大，所造成之反射率愈
大，聲波能量侷限於壓電薄膜內之能力愈
強，Mo/SiO2的組合其聲阻抗比值ZMo / 
ZSiO2=4.5，足以使聲波產生優異之共振。 
最後，本計畫擬採用不同質量負載效應
的方式，進而達到調變諧振共振頻率之目
的；元件製作目標為完成高品質之底電極及
薄膜，包含低電阻率及低表面粗糙度之物理
特性；另外，成長高 C 軸優選排向之氮化鋁
薄膜之製備，再配合不同調變頻率的方式，
達到頻率調變之目的，製作單一微波共振器
元件。

mal air interface while the bottom interface is solidly mounted
through a Bragg reflector structure to the substrate. Further-
more, the interface between the resonator and Bragg reflector
may behave as a clamped or free interface depending on the
detailed arrangement of the reflector layers.
As the SMR device comprises multiple layers with high
and low acoustic impedances, the flatness of each layer of thin
film is a critical issue in fabricating SMR. In order to obtain
SMR devices with high performance, the manufacturing pa-
rameters of thin films were adjusted in this study to obtain
the optimized surface flatness. Moreover, the Bragg reflec-
tors with various numbers of Ti/Mo pairs were fabricated to
clarify their effect on the resonance response of SMR and to
investigate the relation among the reflecting efficiency, the
quality factor and the coupling coefficient. The frequency re-
sponses of SMR devices were measured and compared.
2 Experimental
The SMR device is composed of a piezoelectric
layer which is sandwiched between two metal electrodes and
then attached to a Bragg reflector which has been formed on
a Si substrate, as shown in Fig. 1a. Figure 1b is the top-viewed
schematic structure of the SMR device. In order to expose
the bottom electrode for electrical contact, AlN is wet-etched
in phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in the second mask process. The
top electrodes patterned by the third masking process exhibit
G-S-G type in order to adapt the coplanar probes of the Cas-
cade Microtech (Cascade, Taiwan).
A 4-inch p-type silicon wafer cut into a 1.5 cm square was
used as the substrate. The Bragg reflector was formed by al-
ternately depositing molybdenum (Mo) with high acoustic
impedance and titanium (Ti) with low acoustic impedance
using a dual-gun dc magnetron sputtering system with a ro-
tatable substrate-heating holder instead of an expensive
load-lock system. The dc sputtering system was composed
of a simple chamber with two water-cooled molybdenum
(99.995%, 2-inch-diameter) and titanium (99.995%, 2-inch-
diameter) targets. After the chamber was evacuated to below
1×10−5 Torr, high-purity argon gas (Ar, 99.999%) con-
trolled by a mass flow controller (MFC) was introduced into
the chamber. The dc power and chamber pressure were kept
at about 200 W and 10 mTorr for presputtering. After pre-
sputtering for 30 min, the deposition parameters of substrate
temperature, dc power and deposition pressure were adjusted,
as shown in Table 1, for the sputtering processes. In order
to obtain a Bragg reflector with low surface roughness, the
manufacturing parameters of thin films were adjusted in ac-
cordance with the results of AFM and SEM analysis. With the
optimal deposition power of 200 W, temperature of 400 ◦C
and pressure of 5 mTorr, the surface roughness of four-pair
Ti/Mo multi-layers can be reduced to 13.9 nm. The effect of
various pairs of Ti/Mo Bragg reflectors on the reflection ef-
ficiency of SMR devices was investigated by measuring the
resonance responses of SMRs. The thickness of each layer of
Bragg reflector is one quarter-wavelength (λ/4) of the reson-
ance frequency and therefore the thicknesses of Mo and Ti are
about 0.63 µm and 0.60 µm, respectively.
After the Bragg reflector was fabricated, the AlN piezo-
electric thin film, sandwiched between two layers of metal

TABLE 1 Deposition parameters of AlN, Mo and Ti thin films
electrodes, was deposited onto the reflector. Molybdenum
(Mo) thin film was adopted as the bottom electrode, whereas
aluminum (Al) was used as the top electrode. Both were pat-
terned using photolithography and lift-off techniques. Alu-
minum nitride (AlN) piezoelectric layer with high c-axis pre-
ferred orientation, as shown in Fig. 2a, was deposited on the
bottom electrode using a reactive rf magnetron sputtering sys-
tem. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the AlN thin film,
as shown in Fig. 2b, was carried out on a Siemens D5000
diffractometer (Siemens, Madison, WI), which was adopted
to identify the crystalline structure of AlN thin films. The full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray rocking curve
attached to Fig. 2b is 1.339◦. The sputtering parameters of
AlN thin film were also listed in Table 1. The thickness of the
AlN film was set to 2 µm, i.e. a half-wavelength (λ/2) of the
resonance frequency.

FIGURE 3 The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the Bragg re-
flectors with various pairs of Ti/Mo thin films, (a) two pairs, (b) three pairs,
and (c) four pairs
whereas it shows an additional resonance around 1.2 GHz
owing to the shear mode resonance. The SMR with three pairs
of Ti/Mo layers present an increased return loss of 9.58 dB
at the center frequency of 2.03 GHz, and the resonance re-
sponse also shows excellent sidelobe suppression. The SMR
with four-pair Ti/Mo layers shows a further increased return
loss of 16.7 dB at the center frequency of 2.31 GHz. The de-
signed resonance frequency in our study is 2.5 GHz. However,
due to the situation that the thickness of the piezoelectric thin
film is determined by deposition time, the lack of in-situ moni-
toring results in the thickness deviation of the thin films which
leads to the shifting resonance frequency in Fig. 5.
Figure 6 exhibits the admittance curve with various pairs

Abstract—The high-tone bulk acoustic resonator (HBAR),  
consisted of a Mo/ZnO/Pt/Ti/Si structure, is fabricated. The 
thickness of Si substrate under HBAR is controlled by a two-
step process of wet- and dry-etching. The resonance frequency 
spacing (∆f) of HBAR is dependent on the etching duration. The 
frequency response of the HBAR is measured using an HP8720 
network analyzer and a CASCADE probe station. The 
estimation of Si residue based on the high-tone resonant 
phenomenon coincides with practical measurements. A 
frequency response with no harmonic resonance, which is an 
extreme case of HBAR without Si residue, is revealed. 
Furthermore, a sensor of high-frequency bulk acoustic wave 
resonator is obtained. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) filter 
has been widely adopted in modern communication systems. 
The performance of an FBAR device is better than other 
dielectric ceramic and surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters 
due to its inherent advantages such as low insertion loss, high 
power handling capability and small size. On the other hand, 
when the substrate residue is significantly thicker than that of 
the piezoelectric film, the phenomenon of high-tone 
resonances arises and the high-tone bulk acoustic resonator 
(HBAR) forms [1, 2].  
The HBAR has multiple resonant responses with equal 
resonance frequency spacing (∆f), which is determined by the 
ratio of film thickness to substrate residue. Besides, the 
loading effect on the surface of the resonant region will cause 
the resonant frequency shift. Based on the measurement of 
frequency responses, the substrate residue or mass adhesion 
can be estimated precisely [3-5]. 
For sensor applications, a high-Q resonator that provides a 
precise frequency is essential. Once the operating frequency of 
a mass sensor increases to GHz range, the frequency variation 
caused by the micro mass can be detected easily. When the 
resonant frequency of an HBAR exceeds GHz, which is 
hundreds of times higher than that of the quartz crystal 
microbalance (QCM), HBAR device will be a suitable 
candidate for nanotechnology applications [6]. Besides, the 
HBAR sensor has a sturdy structure and can be easily 
integrated into the integrated circuits (IC).  
In general, the schematic diagram of an HBAR, consisting 
of the composite structures of top electrode, piezoelectric layer, 
bottom electrode and membrane, can be presented as Fig. 1. 
Based on the Mason equivalent circuit, the equivalent 
impedance between the top and bottom electrodes is

where z1=Z1/Zo and z2=Z2/Zo are equivalent impedances on 
the top and bottom surfaces of the piezoelectric layer 
normalized to the acoustic impedance of piezoelectric layer Zo, 
respectively; C0 is static capacitance between the top and

of the piezoelectric layer; lp and vp are the thickness and 
acoustic wave velocity of piezoelectric layer, respectively; kt2 
is the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the 
piezoelectric layer [7-9]. Based on the data of materials, the 
resonant frequency of various modes can be evaluated and the 
frequency spectra of HBAR can be observed in a specific 
frequency range. In this study, the varied frequency responses 
of HBAR devices caused by substrate residue or additional 
deposited materials will be investigated.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The bottom electrode with low surface roughness, high 
conductivity, and good adhesion to substrate was obtained in 
this study. The ZnO film with (002) preferred orientation and 
smooth surface were also obtained using the two-step 
deposition process. Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern and 
cross-sectional image of ZnO/Pt/Ti/SiNx/Si structure, which 
reveals the strong ZnO(002) preferred orientation and texture.  
Generally, Si etched by wet etching using 30 wt% KOH 
solution at 100 ℃ is quick and cost effective; however, wet 
etching is very destructive. The dry etching using RIE is 
expected to be moderate and obviously time consuming. The 
etching rates for wet and dry etching are 253 μm/h and 90   
μm/h, respectively (Fig. 4). The distinguishable features of 
the two methods are contradictory, and hence, two-step 
etching process for cavity fabrication is optimal.

The Si residue can be calculated using Eq. (2). Figure 5 
shows cavities images with and without Si residue. The 
bottom electrode is obvious after dry etching. The Si residue 
can be controlled accurately by dry etching duration. 
Figure 6 presents the frequency responses with and 
without Si residue. The center frequency and coupling 
coefficients are 2208.4375 MHz and 6.7%, respectively, for 
the FBAR without Si residue.

γe2 and γsb are phase delays of the top electrode, bottom 
electrode and substrate, respectively. 
The variations of silicon substrate residue will change the 
phase delay of the substrate. As derived from Eq. 4, the 
γsb=2πflsb/vsb varies with the substrate residue, lsb. Reduction of 
the substrate residue will reduce the number of variations of 
phases in the resonate zone. Therefore, Δf will increase as the 
silicon substrate residue decreases. The single resonant mode 
of HBAR and FBAR is obtained as no silicon substrate 
residues exists (Fig. 6).

Abstract 
   The characteristics of epoxy/(Ba0.8Sr0.2)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BSTZ) composites for the further 
application in embedded capacitor device are investigated. The effects of the ratio of BSTZ ceramic 
powder filler on the chemical, physical and dielectric properties of epoxy/BSTZ composites are 
studied. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) thermal analysis is conducted to determine the 
optimum values of hardener agent, curing temperature, reaction heart, and glass transition 
temperature (Tg). It is found that the hardener reaction process starts at about 115 ℃ and completes 
at about 200 ℃ and this range of temperature is appropriate to process of epoxy/BSTZ composites. 
The highest glass transition temperature (Tg) of 155 ℃ are obtained at 1 equivalent weight ratio 
(hardener/epoxy). Moreover, only the BSTZ phase can be detected in the XRD patterns of the 
epoxy/BSTZ composites. The more BSTZ ceramic powder is mixed with epoxy, the higher 
crystalline intensity of tetragonal BSTZ phase are revealed in the XRD patterns. The dielectric 
constant measured at 1 MHz increases from 5.8 to 23.6 as the content of BSTZ ceramic powder in 
the epoxy/BSTZ composites increases from 10 wt% to 70 wt%. The loss tangents of the 
epoxy/BSTZ composites slightly increase with the increase of measurement frequency.

Introduction 
   The dramatic reduction in size and cost of consumer, automotive, telecommunication, and 
computer electronic devices have taken place in recent years. The passive components become of 
increasing interest, because the number of passives is steadily growing as the electronics products 
are progressing toward higher functionality. For instance, the ratio of the passive elements to active 
components in mobile 3C devices is over 20, and nearly 80% of circuit board area is occupied by 
discrete passive components [1]. To solve these problems, embedded passive technology, which is 
to incorporate passive components into one of inner layers of multi-layer substrate, has been 
actively investigated [2-3]. The main advantages of embedded passive components include: (1) no 
separate interconnects to the substrate, (2) improved electrical performance, (3) lower cost, and (4) 
ease of processing. The special interest is focused on capacitors within various passive components 
on high frequency devices, because the capacitors can be used for various functions, like decoupling 
capacitor (By-Pass capacitor). The coupling effect on the circuit is about 10 to 100 nF and depends 
on the various functional capacitors, and that can be eliminated by the decoupling capacitor for 
composites were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) employing CuKα radiation. The dielectric 
constant (εr) and loss tangent (tanδ) of epoxy/BSTZ composites were measured by HP4294 LCR 
meter from 40 Hz to 1 MHz.  
 
Result and discussion 
The SEM micrograph of self-synthesized (Ba0.8Sr0.2)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BSTZ) ceramic powder is 
shown in Fig. 1. The particle size distribution of BSTZ ceramic powder reveals a less uniformity 
distribution, and the particle size of BSTZ ceramic powder is in the range of 0.8~3 μm. Figure 2 
shows the cross-sectional morphologies of epoxy/BSTZ composites with 10, 30, 50, and 70 wt% of 
BSTZ ceramic powder, respectively. As Fig. 2 shows, the black region represents the epoxy and the 
white and gray particles represent the BSTZ ceramic powder. It is found that the BSTZ particles 
appear more apparent as the content of BSTZ ceramic powder in epoxy/BSTZ composites increases. 
Moreover, the BSTZ ceramic powder shows a uniform dispersing in epoxy and the epoxy/BSTZ 
composites in this investigation show less pores as compared to the other reports [12]. These results 
demonstrate that the fabricated epoxy/BSTZ composites are fitted to the requirements for the 
further application in the embedded devices. 
The curing and thermal behavior of epoxy/BSTZ composites with different equivalent weight 
ratios of hardener/epoxy (r=0.7-1.3) are investigated by using differential scanning calorimeter 
(DSC). The equivalent weight ratio of hardener/epoxy (r) is defined as follow:  
       ( ) /( epoxyhardender
hardener epoxy
WWr
HEW EEW
= )                       (1) 
where Whardener and Wepoxy are the weight of hardener and epoxy, respectively. In the study, the 
hydroxyl equivalent weight (HEW) of hardener is 103 g/equivalent, and the epoxide equivalent 
weight (EEW) of epoxy is 198 g/equivalent. Figure 3 shows the DSC thermograms for the dynamic 
curing of epoxy/BSTZ composites with 70 wt% BSTZ ceramic powder, using various equivalent 
weight ratios of hardener/epoxy at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min. Notably, composites with various 
equivalent weight ratios of hardener/epoxy yields the different reactivity and heat of reaction of the 
samples. It found that epoxy curing by Phenol-Novolac resin begins at the temperature higher than 
100 ℃. Moreover, the temperature of the maximum exothermic peak dropped as the equivalent 
weight ratios increase. This result suggests that the functional group of hardener is the suitable 
candidate for the using at the higher temperature.  
The areas of the exothermic peak, which are directly related to cross-linking density, change 
with the specimen, and are plotted as a function of equivalent weight ratio and the results are shown 
in the Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, it is observed that the heat of reaction first increases and reaches its 
maximum value at r=1, and then decreases as equivalent weight ratio increases. Additionally, the 
maximum glass transition temperature (Tg=155 ℃) of the composites is also obtained at r=1. It can 
be inferred that the high cross-linking density could lead to the large limits of motion of the 
amorphous area in the sample. In the curing sample, motion of the long molecular chain needs a 
high energy in the amorphous area, and it results the composite with a high Tg. Based upon the 
表 Y04

particle sizes. The finer BSTZ ceramic powder can fill the interstitial sites of coarser BSTZ ceramic 
particles, and BSTZ ceramic powder will be well dispersed in the epoxy. And this will result in a 
denser powder packing and reveal a lower loss tangent [12, 14]. The loss tangent slightly increases 
with the increase of frequency and BSTZ ceramic powder, as shown in Fig. 8(b), and that might 
attribute to the existence of porosities in the epoxy/BSTZ composites [14].  
 
Conclusion 
From the SEM observation, even 70 wt% (Ba0.8Sr0.2)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BSTZ) ceramic powder is 
added, the BSTZ ceramic powder is still uniformly dispersed in the epoxy. The differential scanning 
calorimeter (DSC) thermal analysis has determined that the optimum equivalent weight ratio of 
hardener/epoxy is set to 1, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of maximum value at 155 ℃ is 
obtained. It infer that the high cross-linking density could lead to the amorphous area of molecule 
chain decreases, remain amorphous area needs to acquire higher energy to turn around energy. 
From the XRD analysis, the crystal phases of epoxy/BSTZ composites show identical to those of 
BSTZ ceramic powder and the crystal intensities of BSTZ phase increase with the increase content 
of BSTZ ceramic powder in epoxy. As the content of BSTZ ceramic powder in the epoxy/BSTZ 
composites increases form 5 to 70 wt%, the dielectric constant (εr) of composites increases from 5.8 
to 23.6 at 1 MHz. The loss tangent (tanδ) increases slightly with the increase of measured frequency 
and temperature. This result might attribute to the existence of porosities in the epoxy/BSTZ 
composites, but the few pores are shown in composites from the SEM images as compared to the 
other reports. Base up the above expression, the epoxy/BSTZ composites will be the better 
candidate materials to fabricate the embedded capacitor devices.
