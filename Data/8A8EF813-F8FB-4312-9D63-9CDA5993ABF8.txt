3assessment of cellular response to answer
biological questions. 3-5
Diverse gradient generating methods
have been implemented utilizing unique
molecular transportation phenomenon in
microfluidic devices. Employing laminar
flow characteristics in microscale,
theoretically calculated, pre-defined
microchannel patterns facilitate gradient
generation in monotonic6-9, arbitrary6, 10-11,
or logarithmic8, 12-13 fashions in a
continuously perfusion system. In addition,
static microenvironment with concentration
gradient can be generated via free-diffusion
of molecular. Porous/semi-permeable
membrane14-15, hydrogels16-17, and high
resistance microchannels18-19 hinder
convective flow, which allow diffusive
transportation predominate the generation of
gradient between the source and sink regions.
Dynamic control of concentration profile is
feasible as well enabling on-demand change
of stimuli. 20-21
Physiological experiments mostly favor
linear or a small range of concentration,
while pharmalogical examinations, e.g.,
cytotoxicity and dose-response assays,
require logarithmic concentration ranging
across several orders of magnitude.
Logarithmic concentrations were generated
in microfluidic devices via repeated
split-combine approaches8 (T-shaped
microchannel), serial dilutions6, 12, 22-23, and
hybrid serial and volumetric dilutions13. The
Design principle can be theoretically
formulated considering the flow resistance
by analogy with electrical circuit. Resulted
concentrations reveal reasonable accuracy
for MTT/dose-response assays.12-13, 23
However, existing logarithmic concentration
generators aim to produce statically spatial
concentrations, but dynamically temporal
concentration, which is demanded for
single-cell study, is not feasible by the same
design concept. For instance, study on
single-cell pharmacology24 and multidrug
resistance under same-single-cell25 require
temporal concentrations to examine different
Fig. 1 Illustration of a 3-ladder model of a logarithmic concentration generator. At each
branching point, the flow pattern reveals that drug solution comes from upper channel splits
to lower and right channel at a ratio of 1:k-1, and left channel delivers buffer solution to
combine the drug solution at lower channel at a ratio of k-1:1. The entire microchannel
pattern is analogous to an electrical circuit. Channels R1~R3 are designed to obtain desired
flow pattern, and channels Rm are to ensure complete fluid mixing. Sectional equivalent
circuit provides useful scheme for calculating the relationship between Rm and R1~R3 via
Kirchhoff's circuit laws. Simple resistive ratio of each segment of microchannels are solved:

5pre-cured PDMS (10:1, Sylgard 184, Dow
Corning) was casted on the mold and cured
on a 80℃ hotplate for 1hr. The cured
PDMS was peeled, punched inlets/outlets,
and bonded on a plane glass via oxygen
plasma treatment (CUTE-MP, Femto
Science, Korea). All the fluid was delivered
into the device via syringe pumps (NE-1000,
New Era Pump Systems). For dose-response
experiments of ion channels, the integration
approach of logarithmic concentration
generator and planar patch-clamp was
described in detail in our previous work.28
Concentration visualization and
verification
The concentration was visualized and
verified by food and fluorescent dyes
respectively. Green and yellow food dyes
represent drug and buffer solutions,
rendering the dilution process clearly
observed. The device photos (Figs. 2c and
4c) were taken by a digital camera (Nikon
D80) with a macro lens (Tamron SP
AF90mm) during the continuous perfusion
of dye solutions. To quantify the actual
logarithmic concentration, 10 μM
FITC-Dextran (FD4, Sigma Aldrich)
denoted as drugs was diluted with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) in the microfluidic
device. Fluorescent image was taken under a
microscope (Olympus IX71 with DP70
CCD) and analyzed its gray scale using
ImageJ.
Fig. 2 Illustration of statically spatial concentration generator. (a) A generalized design
concept of spatial concentration generator by analogy with electrical circuit. Drug combines
with buffer at each branching point for serial dilution. R1 ,R2 … Rn-1 are designed for
designated flow pattern, and Rm for fluid mixing. Throughout n-1 ladder of serial dilution,
totally n concentrations are generated logarithmically. Symbols Q and C denote for flow rate
and concentration of each outlet. (b) The relation between flow rate, flow resistance, and
outlet concentration. Simple and linear ratio of flow resistance results in desirable
logarithmic concentration at outlets. (c) A device photo of a k = 2 spatial concentration
generator with green and yellow dye visualization. From the enlarged view at the first two
branching point, the green dye splits half to outlet, while the others mixed with the yellow
dye at a ratio of 1:1 to the following mixing region. The concentrations at outlets, from right
to left, should be half of the previous one theoretically.
.
7are denoted by Q1 ,Q2… Qn and C1 ,C2…Cn
respectively. The relationship between flow
rate, microchannel resistance, and outlet
concentration are listed in Fig. 2b. Only two
pressure sources (one for QDrug and the other
for QBuffer) are needed since QBuffer for all the
buffer inlets are identical so that more than
two required buffer inlets would not increase
design complexity substantially.
Figure 2c demonstrates a k = 2 spatial
concentration generator with green and
yellow dye visualization. At each branching
point, the green dye splits half to outlet,
while the others mixed with the yellow dye
at a ratio of 1:1 to the following mixing
region. The relationship of flow resistance
between each microchannel segment is Rm :
R4 : R3 : R2 : R1 = 1 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8. The
concentrations at outlets, from right to left,
should be half of the previous one
theoretically. An analytical solution for
diffusion equation in one dimension was
used to estimate required molecular
diffusion time when traveling in
microchannels.10, 29 To ensure complete
mixing in serpentine microchannels (Rm),
the length of the channel is designed
sufficiently long for more than 97% mixing.
In our case, the 50 μm-width microchannel
with molecular diffusion coefficient 5 ×
10-10 m2/s requires 1.7 second to reach 97%
mixing. The flow velocity was kept constant
at 66.67 mm/s (flow rate = 10 μl/min) so
that the channel length for Rm is chosen for
115 mm. All experiments in this paper
follow this design rule.
We further characterized the outlet
concentration by quantifying its fluorescent
intensity. FITC-Dextran fluorescent dye and
PBS buffer were utilized for concentration
analysis. Figure 3a presents a k = 2 spatial
generator with combined outlet
microchannels to observe all the outlet
Fig. 4 Illustration of dynamically temporal concentration generator. (a) Valves (V1, V2…Vn-1;
V2’, V3’…Vn-1’) are integrated in the microfluidic device to provide temporal control of outlet
concentration. R1 is removed for generation of temporal concentration (resistance
approaches infinite). The choice of valve actuation determines the serial dilution times in the
device. Pairs of valves (Vn-1, Vn-1’) … (V3, V3’), and (V2, V2’) can be sequentially closed to
disable dilution function at nodes Nn-1 … N3, N2 to dynamically alter temporal concentration
outlet Ctemporal. (b) The relation between flow rate, flow resistance, and outlet concentration,
which is different from that in spatial generator since R1 is removed. (c) Device photo of a k =
2 temporal concentration generator with green and yellow dye visualization. With all valves
open, the concentration at temporal concentration outlet is 6.25% of the initial green dye.
9concentration undergoes defined dilution
times and the concentration at outlet can be
dynamically controlled. The operation
principle is illustrated as follows. When all
valves are opened, a n-1 ladder generator
dilutes n times of initial concentration (C0),
which produces a concentration of C0/kn at
Ctemporal outlet. Next, a pair of valves Vn-1
and Vn-1’was closed and dilution no longer
exists at node Nn-1; Ctemporal becomes C0/kn-1.
Similarly, pairs of valves (Vn-2, Vn-2’)… (V3,
V3’), and (V2, V2’) were sequentially closed
to eliminate dilution function at nodes
Nn-2 … N3, N2 to dynamically alter Ctemporal.
To introduce initial stock concentration to
outlet, V1 is closed and drug is directly
delivered without any dilution; QDrug will be
increased to k x QDrug under the
circumstances to ensure constant flow rate
(Qn) at Ctemporal. Consequently the
user-defined logarithmic concentration can
be generated at a single outlet.
The design rule of temporal generator
on microchannel resistance and flow rate
between drug and buffer only differs slightly
from those of spatial generator since they
share the same design principle, as shown in
Fig. 4b. R1 is removed and flow rate ratio
becomes QDrug : QBuffer = 1: k-1 which
indicates a simple volumetric mixing ratio
according to the chosen value “k”; the
relationship of the microchannel resistance
are kept the same except R1. Figure 3c
presents a k = 2 device photo filled with dye
visualization with all valves open. The split
and combine mechanism at the branching
point are similar to that in spatial generator,
except for the first branching point which
simply combine green and yellow dye (1:1).
Since all valves are opened, the
concentration at the temporal concentration
outlet is 6.25% of the initial green dye. Due
to the manual operation of the value
actuation, the time required for fully
concentration exchange in this device is
about 45 seconds. Detail experimental data
are presented in supplementary materials.
The switch could be prompt if solenoid
values are integrated and all process
automated.
The consumption of precious drug
solution is a critical concern. The temporal
generator only uses a portion of initial drug
solution; hence, amount of drug solution
wasted per dose-response assay is an
important parameter to be estimated.
Assuming the duration for each
concentration test is equal, the percentage of
drug usage can be expressed as

. The detail of this
estimation is elucidated in the
supplementary materials. For instance,
percentage of drug usage for 5
concentrations (n=5) with 2-fold (k=2) and
10-fold (k=10) temporal concentration
generator are 64.6% and 79.4%. Therefore,
roughly 20-30 % of drug molecules will not
be used during the experiment. However, the
flow rate in microscale is typically less than
several microliter per minute and rapid
dose-response assays would afford such
consumption.
The merit of the design for generating
both spatial and temporal logarithmic
concentration relies on the unaffected
equivalent electrical circuit upon valve
actuation. Most spatial logarithmic
concentration generator cannot simply
integrate valves to alter the outlet
concentration predictably. The entire flow
pattern would be quite different leading to
disordered concentration. The fundamental
idea of present approach is to strictly control
flow patterns at each branching point to
define volumetric mixing ratio of drug and
buffer. The valving strategy keeps flow
pattern intact except those at unwanted
dilution nodes—valve actuation inactivates
unwanted dilution nodes but retain the
others.
The system is allowed to incorporate
multi-drug inlets to extend its functionality.
A n-1 ladder generator with m distinct drug
inlets can provide n x m drug concentrations
without additional valves. This design

was formed, high quality ion channel
recording was commenced via sequential
generation of logarithmic concentrations for
dose-response assays.
Dose-response assays of ion channels
Endogenous ion channel recording of
HEK cells was demonstrated on the
integrated device. Two kinds of
endogenously expressed voltage-gated
potassium channels, non-inactivating
outward rectifying Kv channels and transient
A-type KA channels, could be observed in
HEK cells.31 Figure 6a shows its typical
whole-cell current traces including both
types of channels. The rapid activated
current (peak current) was solely contributed
by KA channels; plateau steady current was
partly generated by Kv channels.
Current-voltage relation of peak (filled
circles) and plateau (open circles) currents
are also displayed in Fig. 3b. Similar
physiological signature was reported
elsewhere. 31-32
Dose-response assays were performed
on inhibitory activity of potassium channels
by TEA solutions. Figure 7a presents
selected current traces recorded in various
TEA concentrations. The channels were
activated by a 500 ms depolarizing
voltage-clamp to 60 mV from a holding
potential of -60 mV. At TEA 0.01 mM, the
channel response coincides with that from
general extracelluar solution (data not
shown), which indicates that such low TEA
concentration does not affect present
potassium channels significantly. Both peak
and plateau currents were suppressed when
the cell was immersed in TEA concentration
higher than 0.1 mM. When the TEA
concentration was exchanged to 100 mM, no
ion channel current can be measured and all
the channel behavior was inhibited.
Inhibition of plateau potassium current
by TEA solution was investigated. The
concentrations generated both by manual
dilution (as control) and by proposed
logarithmic concentration generator were
examined on ion channel responses. Number
of cells tested was n=5 for control and n=6
for integrated concentration generator.
Dose-response curves fitted by Hill equation
for both cases were shown in Fig. 7b. As
listed in Fig. 7c, the calculated IC50 and Hill
Fig. 7 Dose response assays on inhibitory activity of potassium channels of HEK cells by
TEA solutions. (a) Selected current traces recorded in various TEA concentrations. The
channels were stimulated by a 60 mV, 500 ms depolarizing voltage step from a holding
potential of -60 mV. No channel blockage was observed at 0.01 mM TEA, but all channel
behavior was suppressed at 100 mM. (b) The concentration ranging over 5 orders of
magnitude was generated both by manual dilution (as control) and by proposed logarithmic
concentration generator. Dose-response curves fitted by Hill equation for both cases reveal
the inhibitory activity of potassium channels by TEA solution. (c) Comparison table of IC50
and Hill slope of dose-response assays by two methods of concentration generation. Data
agree well with each other showing the practicability of the present approach.
