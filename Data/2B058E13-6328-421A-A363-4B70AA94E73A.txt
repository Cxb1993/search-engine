and Lin [11] with variable fractal dimension (D) and 
topothesy (G) for asperity heights and a circular contour for 
contact spots is improved in the present study by considering 
the contours of these contact spots with a fractal dimension Ds. 
In the study of Mandelbrot [12], the relationship between D 
and Ds was found to be D=Ds+1. However, this is valid only 
for rough surfaces without any contact deformation. In the 
present study, D, G, and Ds are considered to be varying with 
the mean surface separation between two contact surfaces. 
The D-Ds relationships for the contacts at the elastic, 
elastoplastic, and the fully plastic deformation regimes are 
derived and the inceptions of the elastoplastic deformation 
regime and the fully plastic deformation regime are redefined 
using the equality of two expressions established in two 
different ways for the number of contact spots (N). A 
comparisons of three models, constant G and D and variable 
D and G with a circular contour, and variable G, D, and Ds 
(fractal contour), is made for the total contact load and the real 
contact area. 
 2. Theoretical Analysis for Contact Surfaces 
The contact of two rough surfaces (see Fig.2) can be 
modeled by a flat and smooth surface in contact with a rough 
surface. If the mean radii of curvature of the asperities on 
surface 1 and surface 2 are R1 and R2 respectively, the 
equivalent rough surface can be expressed as having the radius 
of curvature, R, satisfying 1 21 R =1 R +1 R . If 1σ  and 2σ  
denote the standard deviations of the surface roughness of 
surface 1 and surface 2, respectively. The standard deviation, 
σ , for this equivalent rough surface satisfies 2 21 2σ= σ +σ . 
2.1 Contact Properties of Elastic, Elastoplastic, and 
Fully Plastic Deformations Derived from the 
Cross Section of a Circular Asperity 
According to Hertz theory, the elastic contact area, ae, 
the elastic contact load, eF , and the average contact pressure, 
Pe, produced by a sphere with a radius of R in contact with a 
flat, smooth plate with an elastic interference, δ , are 
respectively given as [13]:

where E denotes the effective Young’s modulus of two solid 
contact surfaces (surface 1 and surface 2) with Young’s moduli, 
E1 and E2, and Poisson ratios, 1ν  and 2ν , respectively. It is 
stated as: 2 21 1 2 21 E =1-ν E +1-ν E . 
In the fully plastic deformation regime, the asperity’s 
contact area, ap, the contact load, Fp, and the average contact 
pressure, Pp, can be respectively expressed as [13]: 
pa =2πRδ                             (4) 
p pF =H a⋅                              (5) 
pP =H                                (6) 
The critical interference, cδ , that marks the transition 
from the elastic deformation to the elastoplastic deformation 
(i.e., the yielding inception) is given as ( )2cδ = πKH 2E R [7,14]. Where H denotes the hardness of 
the softer material and K is written as 
K=0.454+0.41ν [7,14]. 
The dependencies of the asperity’s contact area, aep, the 
contact load, Fep, and the average contact pressure, Pep, in the 
elastoplastic deformation regime were presented by Kogut and 
Etsion [14] in a dimensionless forms as:

where the coefficients, 1 3c ~c , and the exponents, 1 3e ~e , for 
the first and second elastoplastic regimes were given in the 
study [14].  
2.2 Contact Properties in the Elastic, Elastoplastic, 
and Fully Plastic Deformations Based on the 
Island-Shaped Cross Section of an Asperity 
For a given contact spot with an area a, the 
dimensionless interference, ( )δ δ σ∗ ≡ , and the 
dimensionless effective radius of curvature, ( )R R σ∗ ≡ , can 
be expressed as [7]:  
* (4-D) *(D-2) 1 2 (D-3) 2 *(3-D) 2δ =2 G (ln α) π a      (10.a)

The dimensionless topothesy, *G , and the dimensionless 
contact area, *a , can be expressed as: *G G σ≡ ; * 2a a σ≡ . 
Asperities with ca<a  are elastically deformed since 
they satisfy the condition of cδ<δ ; whereas asperities with 
ca a≥  are thus considered to be operating in the elastoplastic 
deformation, even in the fully plastic deformation regime. 
Define the dimensionless critical contact area as ( )2c ca a σ∗ ≡ , and the dimensionless largest contact area as 
( )2L La a σ∗ ≡ . By substituting Eq.(10.a) and Eq.(10.b) into 
Eq.(2), Eq.(8) and Eq.(5) respectively, the dimensionless 
contact load of an asperity for the elastic, elastoplastic and 
fully plastic deformations can be expressed in fractal form as:

Eq. (23.a) and Eq. (26.a) show the same relationship that 
Ds=D-1 is valid for the elastic and fully plastic deformation 
regimes. As Eq.(24.a) and Eq.(25.a) show, the D-Ds 
relationships in the first and the second elastoplastic regimes 
no longer satisfy Ds=D-1. 
2.5 The Total Contact Load and Real Contact 
Area between Contact Surfaces 
If the size distribution parameter, n(a*), of the asperities 
at each of the elastic, elastoplastic and fully plastic 
deformation regimes is available, the total contact load and 
real contact area of a surface in the dimensionless form ( )* 2t tF F E σ≡ ⋅ and ( )* 2t tA A σ≡  can be expressed as:

respectively. 
3. Results and Discussion 
With two different initial plasticity indices for two 
rough surface before arising contact deformation, the 
variations of the fractal dimension D of the asperity heights 
and the fractal dimension Ds of the island-shaped contours 
with the dimensionless mean separation (d*) are shown in 
Fig.3 (a) for (ψ)0=0.75  and Fig.3(b) for (ψ)0=2.0. As the 
feature of microcontacts is shown in the study of Liou and Lin 
[11], the value of the probability density function (g) 
associated with the fully plastic deformation regime is 
extremely small, irrespective of the plasticity index value. The 
g function is needed in the evaluation of the contact number of 
asperities operating in one of three deformation regimes. 
Therefore, only the profile fractal dimensions (Ds) exhibited in 
the elastic deformation regime and the first and second 
elastoplastic deformation regimes are exhibited in the present 
study. Either Fig. 3(a) or Fig. 3(b) shows the behavior that all 
fractal dimensions including D and Ds at different deformation 
regimes are elevated by increasing the mean separation d*. 
Only a single curve is obtained for the D parameter; however, 
different curves are obtained for the Ds parameters defined for 
different deformation regimes. At a fixed mean separation, the 
profile fractal dimension defined for the elastic deformation, 
(Ds)e, is always larger than that defined for the first and second 
elastoplastic deformations (Ds)ep1 and (Ds)ep2. The difference 
between the (Ds)ep1 and (Ds)ep2 at a mean separation d* is, 
however, negligibly small because the coefficients shown in 
the (Ds)ep1 and (Ds)ep2 expressions are quite close each other. 
The closeness between (Ds)ep1 and (Ds)ep2 is reasonable 
because the (Ds)ep parameter in the entire elastoplastic 
deformation regime should be a single value. The slight 
difference between (Ds)ep1 and (Ds)ep2 is caused because the 
elastoplastic deformation regime was divided into two 
subregimes in the establishments of microcontacts parameters 
in the study of Kogut and Etsion [14]. 
Following four dimensionless contact area parameters, 
*
ca , 
*
1a , 
*
2a  and 
*
La , which are employed to define the 
elastic deformation regime and the first and second 
deformation regimes are no longer constant values, but are 
varied with the mean separation d* in the present study. In the 
conventional model, the fractal dimension for asperity heights 
(D) and the topothesy (G) are constant over the entire range of
