Several important types of meshless methods are 
also reported in the literature [3-8, 14-18, 21, 22, 
25, 26, 28, 32, 35, 44, 45].  
Among the above-mentioned meshfree 
literatures, the method of fundamental solutions 
(MFS) is extensively applied to solve some of 
engineering problems [4, 21, 35]. The MFS is one 
kind of meshless methods, since only boundary 
nodes are needed. Comprehensive reviews of the 
MFS were published by Fairweather and 
Karageorghis [21] and Chen and Golberg [4]. In 
order to avoid the problem of singularity, the 
solution is presented as a set of single layer 
potential (corresponding to the fundamental 
solution) on nonphysical boundary (namely 
fictitious boundary). A regular formulation and 
singularity-free method is then obtained, which is 
attractive and relatively easy to use. However the 
MFS has not become a popular numerical method 
because the controversial artificial boundary 
locates outside the physical domain. In general the 
fictitious boundary is difficult to choose for a 
complicated geometry. This produces a limitation 
on the implementation of the MFS, since the 
locations of the source points require good 
estimates. The diagonal coefficients of the 
influence matrices are divergent in common case 
when the fictitious boundary approaches the real 
boundary. Despite of the disappearance of 
singularities, the influence matrices become ill 
posed when the fictitious boundary is far away 
from the real boundary. The results become very 
sensitive, since the condition number gets very 
large.  
 
The goal of this study is to develop a novel 
singular meshless method with the source points 
on the physical boundary to solve the modified 
Helmholtz equation. We present an alternative 
approach for the numerical treatment, retaining the 
salient meshless features of the MFS and selecting 
the normal derivative of fundamental solution of 
the modified Helmholtz equation as the radial 
basis functions (RBF). The solution of the 
problem is expressed in terms of a double-layer 
potential instead of single-layer potential 
representation on the physical boundary without 
the integral process. The proposed meshless 
method avoids the ambiguity of off-set distance of 
the fictitious boundary in the conventional MFS 
by improving the singularity evaluation of 
diagonal terms when the source and boundary 
points are coincident.  
 
By using the regularized technique of 
subtracting and adding-back method, the 
singularity and hypersingularity of the kernel 
functions can be regularized. The main idea is to 
add an augmented series containing one singular 
term and then to subtract the same singular term 
from the series of the solution representation. The 
two singular terms are equal and the sum of the 
augmented series is zero. In general the diagonal 
terms of the influence matrices can then be 
derived by using the proposed technique for 
arbitrary domain. Furthermore, the innovative 
concept of this study is that this regularized 
technique has never been used in the context of 
meshless methods except the writers’ recent 
publications on the Laplace and Helmholtz 
equation [12, 13, 44, 45]. In this study, we extend 
it to modified Helmholtz equation. Finally, we 
present several test problems for the 2-D water 
wave scattering problem passing the submerged 
breakwater governed by modified Helmholtz 
equation to demonstrate the validity of our 
provided method.  
 
The primary function of submerged breakwaters is 
to reduce wave energy transmitted through it and 
to have the advantages of allowing water 
circulation, fish passage, providing economical 
protection. A suitable arrangement of a thin barrier 
may act as a good model for a breakwater.

The chosen RBFs are the double layer potentials 
from the potential theory given as:

= −∑ , kn  is the k-th 
component of the outward normal vector at source 
point sj; kn  is the k-th component of the outward 
normal vector at field point xi. It is noted that the 
double layer potentials in Eqs.(12) and (13) have 
both singularity and hypersingularity at the origin, 
which leads to troublesome singular kernels and 
controversial auxiliary boundary for the MFS. The 
off-set distance between the off-set (auxiliary) 
boundary (B') and the real boundary (B) needs to 
be chosen deliberately. To overcome this drawback, 
js  is distributed on the real boundary by using 
the following proposed regularized techniques. 
The rationale for choosing the double layer 
potential instead of single layer potential as used 
in the proposed method for the form of RBFs is to 
take advantage of the regularization of the 
subtracting and adding-back technique, so that no 
off-set distance is needed when evaluating the 
diagonal coefficients of influence matrices as 
explaining in the following section. The single 
layer potential cannot be chosen as the form of 
RBFs, because the Eqs.(20) and (21) in the 
following text of Section 3 are not satisfied. If the 
single layer potential is used, the regularized 
technique of subtracting and adding-back method 
will fail. 
 
2-3 Derivation of diagonal coefficients of influence 
matrices for arbitrary domain by using the 
regularized meshless method 
When the collocation point xi approaches to the 
source point sj, Eqs.(12) and (13) will be 
approximated by: 
 (14)
 
 
(15)
by using the limiting form for small arguments and 
the identities from the generalized function as shown 
below [1], 
    (16)
      (17)
The kernels in Eqs.(14) and (15) have the same 
singularity strength as the Laplace equation [42]. 
Therefore, Eqs.(6) and (7) for the interior problem 
need to be regularized by using special treatment 
such as

For the infinite strip problem, the domain can be

To demonstrate the validity of the MMFS, three 
examples for applying on the water wave problem 
with infinite strip domain of obliquely incident water 
wave past a submerged breakwater are given as: 
Case 1: A rigid barrier with =1b
h
: 
An example given by Abul-Azm [2] is considered. 
In this case, the width to length ratio (
b
h
) is 1, and 
the submergence ratio (
d
h
) is 0.75. The nodes and its 
normal vector distributions are shown in Fig.2. By 
using the proposed formulation, the reflection and 
transmission coefficients are plotted against kh for 
the normal incident wave ( =0oθ ) in Fig.3. The 
reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted 
versus the angle of incidence (θ ) for kh=0.5 in Fig.4 
and kh=1.5 in Fig.5. From Figs.(3)~(5), the results 
compare well with the results using the BEM and 
eigenfunction expansion method by Abul-Azm [2]. 
The conservation of energy 
2 2
LE %= + -1 100%R T ×  can be viewed as error 
index between the numerical solution and analytical 
solution. To see the sensitivity and convergence 
analysis of results, we plot the meaningful figures in 
Figs.(6)~(8). In Fig.(6) due to numerical parameters 
particularly for the case of higher wave number, the 
error index, LE % , is plotted versus number of 
nodes for the higher wave number (kh=5 ). After 
comparing with the results of BEM in Fig.(6), the 
result shows good convergence by employing the 
proposed meshless method. The relative error versus 
CPU time for equivalent degree of freedom in BEM 
and RMM are shown in Fig.(7). The convergent rate 
in BEM and RMM are the same and rapid. Fig.(8)
