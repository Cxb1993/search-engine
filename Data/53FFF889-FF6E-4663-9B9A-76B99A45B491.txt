information following a specific pattern. To illustrate our
result, we consider a target encircling problem that was
originally proposed in [15], where the agents are assumed
to have identical dynamics. The extension to systems with
heterogeneous agents requires a new cooperative control
scheme. Following stability criterion described above, a novel
cyclic pursuit scheme is designed to solve the target encircling
problem. By using our theoretical tool, we are able to verify
rigorously that the new control scheme works, which is also
shown by the numerical simulations.
The content of this report is summarized from our recent
articles [9], [10], [11], which are either published or to be
published (in press) in international journals or proceedings
of international conferences. The above mentioned articles are
co-authored with Prof. Ulf Jo¨nsson of the Division of Opti-
mization and Systems Theory, Royal Institute of Technology,
Stockholm, Sweden.
III. THE MAIN RESULTS
In this section we present the findings of this research
project. In this project, we consider heterogeneous stable
linear time-invariant (LTI) single-input single-output systems
(SISO) interconnected over a network. Figure 1 illustrates
such a network where the nodes represent LTI systems
(denoted by 퐻푘) which are interconnected over a circular
graph.
The system can be expressed in the following form
푢 = Γ푦
푦 = 퐻푢+ 푒,
(1)
where1 퐻 = ⊕푛푘=1퐻푘 with each2 퐻푘 ∈ 풜 representing
the node dynamics and Γ ∈ 풜푛×푛 models the network
interconnection. The disturbance 푒 ∈ L2[0,∞) represents the
effect of initial conditions and stability of this system means
that there exists a constant 푐 > 0 such that ∥푦∥+∥푢∥ ≤ 푐∥푒∥
for all 푒 ∈ L2[0,∞).
As we have mentioned,system (1) can be viewed as a
set of linear dynamics {퐻푘, 푘 = 1, . . . , 푛} interconnected
1The notation 퐻 = ⊕푛
푘=1
퐻푘 is used to denote the diagonal matrix
diag(퐻1, . . . ,퐻푛)
2Here we let 풜푛×푛 denote the algebra of transfer functions obtained as
the Laplace transforms of the impulse response functions
ℎ(푡) = ℎ0(푡)휃(푡) + ℎ0훿(푡),
where ℎ0(푡) ∈ L푛×푛1 [0,∞), ℎ0 ∈ R푛×푛.
over a graph described by Γ. The 푘, 푙 component of Γ
represents the gain from node 푙 to node 푘. We allow local
feedback; i.e., 훾푘,푘 is allowed to be non-zero. By allowing
Γ ∈ 풜푛×푛, the components of Γ may sometimes be used to
model communication channels with transmission delays and
bandwidth limitations.
In this section we assume that Γ is normal which means
that3 Γ(푗휔)∗Γ(푗휔) = Γ(푗휔)Γ(푗휔)∗, ∀휔 ∈ R ∪ {∞}.
Examples of normal matrices include the symmetric, skew-
symmetric and circulant matrices defined as
Γ(푠) = circ(훾1(푠), . . . , 훾푛(푠))
=
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
훾1(푠) 훾2(푠) 훾3(푠) . . . 훾푛(푠)

⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ .
As an example, the circular graph in Figure 1 above can be
modeled as
Γ = circ(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1).
The property that Γ is normal implies that it is unitarily
diagonalizable and this is exploited in the derivation of the
results discussed below. For more general matrices we do
not get explicit expressions for the instability regions Ω
introduced below and this adds to the computational burden
of the analysis.
A. Multiplier Characterization of Spectrum
The key property of the network interconnection Γ that
will be explored here is its spectrum. This is generally not a
sufficiently tight characterization for getting sharp stability
criteria but often results in useful and attractive stability
criteria that has close resemblance with the classical Nyquist
criterion.
Let Λ = {휆1, . . . , 휆푛} be a set of 푛 complex numbers and
let us define the following three sets of multipliers
휋1Λ =
{[
휋11 휋12
휋¯12 휋22
]
: 휋11 ≥ 0, 휋22 ≤ 0,
∣휆푘∣2휋11 + 2Re 휆¯푘휋12 + 휋22 ≤ 0; ∀휆푘 ∈ Λ
}
휋2Λ =
{[
휋11 휋12
휋¯12 휋22
]
: 휋22 ≤ 0,
∣휆푘∣2휋11 + 2Re 휆¯푘휋12 + 휋22 ≤ 0; ∀휆푘 ∈ Λ
}
휋3Λ =
{[
휋11 휋12
휋¯12 휋22
]
:
∣휆푘∣2휋11 + 2Re 휆¯푘휋12 + 휋22 ≤ 0; ∀휆푘 ∈ Λ
}
where 휋11 and 휋22 are real numbers and 휋12 is a complex
number. The descriptive power of the multipliers can be
understood by investigating the sets
Λ푘 =
{
휆 ∈ C : ∣휆푘∣2휋11 + 2Re 휆¯푘휋12 + 휋22 ≤ 0;
∀휋 ∈ Π푘Λ
}
,
where 푘 = 1, 2, 3. It can be shown that Λ1 = co {Λ ∪ {0}},
Λ2 = Λ∪{0} and Λ3 = Λ as is illustrated in Figure 2, see [10]
3For the sake of simplifying the notation, we often suppress the depen-
dence on 휔 and write Γ∗Γ = ΓΓ∗.

robust in the sense that if the second condition is violated then
it is possible to construct a normal interconnection matrix
with eigenvalues in the prescribed region Λ such that the
interconnection in (1) is unstable. Note that since the primal
and dual criterion are equivalent it follows that if the three-
dimensional Nyquist test in the dual is violated then at some
frequency there fails to exist a multiplier such that (2) holds.
The three-dimensional Nyquist test can be projected down
to the complex plane. The resulting Nyquist criterion is easier
to check but it is generally more conservative.
We finally note that the set Λ is allowed to be frequency
dependent in both the primal and the dual criterion.
2) Less Conservative Formulation: Next we will discuss
the case where the multipliers from the set 휋2Λ are used
in the analysis. This leads to a less conservative stability
criterion but the robustness interpretation discussed above
is no longer valid and the criterion involves an additional
assumption on a known stable homogeneous interconnection;
i.e. an interconnection where all the subsystems are identical.
In this case the primal condition becomes
Primal Stability Criterion 2: Suppose that for each 휔 ∈
[0,∞]
(푖) eig(Γ(푗휔)) ∈ Λ2 := {0, 휆1, . . . , 휆푛},
(푖푖) there exists 휋 ∈ 휋2Λ such that
휋11 + 2Re휋12퐻푘(푗휔) + 휋22∣퐻푘(푗휔)∣2 > 0
for 푘 = 0, 1, . . . , 푛 where 퐻0 ∈ 풜 is such that (퐼 −
퐻0Γ)
−1 ∈ 풜푛×푛.
Then the system in (1) is stable.
The corresponding dual formulation is
Dual Stability Criterion 2: Suppose that for each 휔 ∈ R∪
{∞}
(푖) eig(Γ(푗휔)) ∈ Λ2 := {0, 휆1, . . . , 휆푛},
(푖푖) 풩 [퐻0, 퐻1, . . . , 퐻푛](휔) ∩ Ω푒 = ∅,
(푖푖푖) 퐻0 ∈ 풜 is such that (퐼 −퐻0Γ)−1 ∈ 풜푛×푛,
where the three-dimensional Nyquist polytope is defined as
in (3) and the instability region is defined as
Ω푒 = co
{(
Re
1
휆푘
, Im
1
휆푘
,
1
∣휆푘∣2
)
: 휆푘 ∕= 0
}
+ (0, 0,R+) .
Then the system in (1) is stable.
The second condition is illustrated in Figure 4 for the same
example that was used to illustrate the robust criterion stated
in the previous subsection. For simplicity, we assume 퐻0 =
퐻1. The instability region is now much smaller and the
criterion is thus in general less conservative.
We remarked in the previous subsection that the com-
putational complexity of the primal criterion scales grace-
fully as the network size increases. The dual formulation
provides a similar justification of the benefits of the new
criterion. If the multivariable Nyquist criterion is used for
the stability analysis then the eigenvalue locus of an 푛 × 푛
dimensional transfer function must be computed at each
frequency which demands a computational complexity of
푂(푛3). The computational complexity required to compute
the Nyquist polytope (i.e. to compute the convex hull of 푛
points in the complex plane) is 푂(푛 log(푛)) and there exist
algorithms with linear expected time. Therefore the overall

computational complexity is very advantageous compared to
using the multivariable Nyquist criterion in cases where Γ is
a constant matrix or a transfer function of certain structure,
e.g. circulant such that the eigenvalues can be computed with
low complexity using the Fourier transform. Most important,
however, is that the new criterion clarifies the contribution of
the individual subsystems in a way that is easy to understand
intuitively for an engineer. The price paid for the engineering
insight and the scalability is that the criterion in general could
be conservative.
C. Heterogeneous Consensus Networks
The stability criteria stated in Section III-B is applied
to verify consensus of heterogeneous networks where the
interconnection topology is defined by a normal matrix and
the dynamics of individual agents may include arbitrary
(stable) dynamic uncertainties. Such networks are illustrated
in Figure 5. The governing equation of the network can be
simply expressed as
푦 = 퐻(Γ푦 + 푟). (4)
where the dynamics of heterogeneous agents are collected
in 퐻 and Γ models the interconnection topology. The dis-
turbance 푟 can be used to represent or generate the initial
conditions. We assume that 퐻 = ⊕푛푖=1퐻푖 with 퐻푖(푠) =
1
푠
푃푖(푠), 푃푖 ∈ 풜, for all 푖 = 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 푛, and that Γ ∈ R푛×푛 is
normal, satisfying
Γ1 = 0, where 1 = 1√
푛
[
1 . . . 1
]푇
,
and eig(Γ) = {0, 휆2, . . . , 휆푛}, where Re휆푛 ≤ . . . ≤ Re휆2 <
0. Such interconnection topology occurs, for example, when
the neighbors of an agent are indexed by 푁푖+1 = {(푗 +
1)mod푛 : 푗 ∈ 푁푖}, 푖 = 1, . . . , 푛 − 1. In this case
the corresponding Γ is circulant (and thus normal) and its
eigenvalues belong to the disc centered at −1 and with radius
equal to 1. Note that the assumption Γ ∈ R푛×푛 is made for
the sake of simplicity; our result is also applicable even when
Γ ∈ 풜푛×푛. Given the structure of 퐻 and Γ, the output of (4)
can at best converge to a steady state solution 푦0 satisfying
6
With our proposed pursuit scheme, the system can also be
represented as in Figure 5, where
퐻(푠) =
푠+ 1
푠2
⊕푛푖=1 푃푖(푠) (8)
Γ(푠) =

)

푠
(10)
Note that Γ is a frequency-dependent circulant matrix. We
thus have a frequency-dependent spectral decomposition
Γ(푠) = 푈(푠)diag(0, 휆2(푠), . . . , 휆푛(푠))푈(푠)∗ (11)
where 푈(푠) =
[
1 푉 (푠)
]
, 1 ⊥ 푉 (푠), and 푉 (푠)∗푉 (푠) =
퐼푛−1. With these observations in mind, we note that the
interconnected system described above is similar to what we
considered in Section III-C, with the distinction that each
퐻푖(푠) has a double pole at the origin, and that Γ is dynamic.
In [9], the criterion stated in Theorem 1 was extended to
cover this more general scenario. To this end, we utilize
the eigenvalues in the spectral decomposition of Γ(푠) shown
in (11) to define
Ωˆ푒(휔) =
{
푛∑
푖=2
휓푖
(
Re휆푖(푗휔), Im휆푖(푗휔), ∣휆푖(푗휔)∣2
)
:
휓푖 ≥ 0, 푖 = 2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 푛;
푛∑
푖=2
휓푖 ≤ 1
}
(12)
= co
{
(Re휆푘(푗휔), Im휆푘(푗휔), ∣휆푘(푗휔)∣2) : 푘 = 1, . . . 푛
}
The consensus theorem is stated as follows.
Theorem 2: Consider system (4), where 퐻 = ⊕푛푖=1퐻푖
with 퐻푖(푠) = 푠+1푠2 푃푖(푠), 푃푖 ∈ 풜 satisfy 푃푖(0) > 0, 푖 =
1, . . . , 푛 and where Γ and 푟 are defined in (9) and (10),
respectively. Furthermore, assume that Γ(푠) can be decom-
posed as in (11) and let its eigenvalues define the “instability”
region Ωˆ푒(휔) as in (12). Let 퐻0(푠) := 푠+1푠2 푃0(푠) be the
transfer function representation of a nominal system with
푃0 ∈ 풜, 푃0(0) > 0 such that 푠2퐼 − 푠2퐻0(푠)휆푖(푠), 푖 =
2, . . . 푛 has no zeros in the closed right half plane. Suppose
∀휔 ∈ R ∪ {∞}∖{0},
풩ˆ [퐻0, 퐻1, . . . , 퐻푛](휔)
∩
Ωˆ푒(휔) = ∅,
where 풩ˆ [퐻0, 퐻1, . . . , 퐻푛](휔) is defined as Theorem 1. Then
the outputs of the system satisfy 풫1⊥푦(푡)→ const as 푡→∞,
where 풫1⊥ is the projection onto span{1}⊥.
IV. EXAMPLES
In this section, we provide numerical examples to illustrate
the theorems we presented in Section III-C and III-D.
A. Heterogeneous Consensus Networks
To illustrate Theorem 1 presented in Section III-C, let
us consider a network of eight nodes (agents) where the
interconnection topology is shown in the left of Figure 8.
Under this connection topology, each agent communicates
with two of its neighbors. The corresponding interconnection
matrix is circulant; i.e., Γ = circ(−1, 0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0).
It can be easily verified that the eigenvalues of Γ are
eig(Γ) = {−1.85± 푖0.35,−1.15± 푖0.35,−1,−0.5± 0.5, 0}.

shown the projection of Ωˆ푒 and 풩ˆ [퐻1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ,퐻8](휔) down to the complex
plane.
The corresponding two-dimensional instability region Ωˆ푒 is
illustrated in the right of Figure 8.
Suppose the dynamics of the agents are as follows:

.
The left figure in Figure 9 illustrates the three-dimensional
graphical stability test for the range of frequencies 휔 ∈
[−2, 2]. The corresponding instability region Ωˆ푒 is marked by
red and 풩ˆ [퐻1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 퐻8](휔), 휔 ∈ [−2, 2], is marked by blue.
Note that Ωˆ푒 and 풩ˆ [퐻1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 퐻8](휔) intersected only at the
origin when 휔 = 0. Thus the stability criterion is satisfied and
by Theorem 1 we conclude that the outputs of the eight agents
reach consensus. The right figure in Figure 9 illustrates the
projection of Ωˆ푒 and 풩ˆ [퐻1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 퐻8](휔) down to the complex
plane.
B. Target Encircling Formation Control
To illustrate the cyclic pursuit scheme and the consensus
theorem we proposed in Section III-D, let us consider the

1) we have identified a class of interconnected systems;
namely, the system of form (1), which has a special
structure that we can exploit for developing scalable
stability analysis;
2) such stability criteria have been developed;
3) such criteria have been extended to treat another class
of problem;
4) such criteria have been applied to solve a practical
formation control problem.
The scientific findings of this research project are proven
to be novel; some of the main results documented in this
reported have been presented at
∙ SICE Annual Conference 2010, Taipei, Taiwan (cita-
tion [11]: “Verification of Consensus in Networks of
Heterogeneous LTI Agents” by Ulf Jo¨nsson and Chung-
Yao Kao),
and are accepted to be presented at
∙ IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Atlanta,
USA, 2010 (citation [9]: “Consensus of Heterogeneous
Linear Agents Applied to a Formation Control Problem”
by Ulf Jo¨nsson and Chung-Yao Kao).
Both are important international conferences in our research
field. In addition, an article which contains most of the
results documented in this reported, entitled “A Scalable
Robust Stability Criterion for Systems with Heterogeneous
LTI Components” (by Ulf Jo¨nsson and Chung-Yao Kao) has
been accepted to published in
∙ IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (in press, cita-
tion [10]).
Another article which contains other important results derived
from this research project, entitled “Robustness analysis for
feedback interconnections of unstable distributed systems
via integral quadratic constraints” (by Michael Cantoni, Ulf
Jo¨nsson, and Chung-Yao Kao) has been provisionally ac-
cepted to published in
∙ IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (citation [2]).
In summary, through this research project, two journal
articles have been accepted to be published in IEEE
Transactions on Automatic Control, the very prestigious
journal in our research field, and two conference articles
have been presented or will be presented in important
international conferences.
Finally, this project has trained and provided financial
support for four Master’s students. The research has also
provided opportunities for international collaboration with

三、建議 
 
如上所提，吾人深感台灣對系統理論領域的重視程度及參與規模之不足，與台灣對所謂
的高科技電機電子通訊產業的關注，成一諷刺的強烈對比，特別是系統理論乃是為數不少的
電機產業相關工程之基礎。發展真正的高科技產業需由基礎做起；台灣各界應該正視系統理
論的重要性，適度地鼓勵學者及學生加入這個領域，從事重要性不亞於其它科學的基礎研究。

respectively. The notation 푀 > 0 (“≥”,“<”, and “≤”,
respectively) is used to denote positive definiteness (positive
semi-definiteness, negative definiteness, and negative semi-
definiteness, respectively). Symbol l푚2 denotes the space
of R푚-valued, square summable functions defined on time
interval (−∞,∞), and l푚2푒 denotes the extension of the space
l
푚
2 , which consists of functions whose time truncation lies
in l푚2 . Notation Rl
푙×푚
∞ is used to denote the space of proper
rational transfer matrices (of dimension 푙×푚) with no poles
on the unit circle, while Rh푙×푚∞ denotes the subspace of
Rl
푙×푚
∞ consisting of functions which have no poles outside
the open unit disk. Every 퐻 ∈ Rl푙×푚∞ defines a convolution
operator on l2: let ℎ be the inverse Laplace transform of 퐻 .
Then for any 푢 ∈ l2,
(퐻푢)[푘] :=
∞∑
푙=−∞
ℎ[푘 − 푙]푢[푙].
Given a signal 푓 in the l2 space, we use ∥푓∥l2 to denote the
l2 norm of 푓 . Given a bounded operator 퐺 on the l2 space,
we use ∥퐺∥l2 to denote the l2 induced norm of 퐺.
Let Π be a bounded LTI self-adjoint operator on l2 space.
Then Π defines a quadratic form on l2
휎Π(푣, 푤) :=
〈[
푣
푤
]

[
푣
푤
]〉

푤ˆ(푗휔)
]
푑휔
where 푣ˆ and 푤ˆ are Fourier transforms of 푣 and 푤, re-
spectively. The operator Π is referred to as the multiplier
of the quadratic form 휎Π. The multiplier Π is often block
partitioned into the form[
Π11 Π12
Π∗12 Π22
]
where the dimensions of Π푖푗 are consistent with those of 푣
and 푤.
Given an operator ℋ and a quadratic form 휎Π(푣, 푤)
defined on l2 space, we said that ℋ satisfies the integral
quadratic constraint defined by 휎Π, or more often “ℋ satisfies
IQC defined by Π” to emphasize the multiplier involved, if
휎Π(푣,ℋ(푣)) ≥ 0 for all 푣 ∈ l2.
Let 풟휏 denote the time-delay operator 풟휏 (푣) := 푣[푘 −
휏 [푘]], and 풮휏 be the “delay-difference” operator (퐼 − 풟휏 );
i.e., 풮휏 (푣) := 푣[푘]− 푣[푘− 휏 [푘]]. To simplify the notation, in
the rest of the paper we will suppress the time dependency
on 휏 [푘] and simply write it as 휏 .
In order for the readers who are not familiar with IQC
analysis to appreciate the technical contents of the next
section, in the following we state a stability theorem ob-
tained by applying the IQC analysis to linear time-invariant
(LTI) discrete-time (DT) systems with time-varying delays.
Consider LTI DT systems with time-varying delays governed
by the following equation:
푥[푘 + 1] = 퐴푥[푘] +퐴푑(푥[푘 − 휏 ] + 푓) (2)
where the time-varying delay sequence 휏 is upper bounded
by 풯 but otherwise unknown. We assume that 퐴 + 퐴푑 is
stable (i.e., all eigenvalues of 퐴 + 퐴푑 are strictly inside
the unit circle), which is a necessary condition for stability.
The system can be equivalently expressed as the feedback
interconnection
푥 = 퐺푤 + 푒, 푤 = 풮휏푥 (3)
where 퐺 is a LTI DT stable system with transfer function
representation 퐺(푧) = −(푧퐼 − (퐴 + 퐴푑))−1퐴푑 and 푒 =
−퐺푓 ∈ l2. We have the following stability theorem for
(2), which follows straightforwardly the general IQC theory
stated in [8].
Theorem 1. Consider system (2) and the equivalent trans-
formation (3). Suppose
(i) 풮휏 satisfies IQC defined by Π :=
[
Π11 Π12
Π∗12 Π22
]
;
(ii) Π11 ≥ 0 and Π22 ≤ 0;
(iii) there exists 휖 > 0 such that[
퐺(e푗휔)
퐼
]∗
Π(e푗휔)
[
퐺(e푗휔)
퐼
]
≤ −휖퐼, ∀ ∣휔∣ ≤ 휋. (4)
Then the feedback interconnection (3) is stable, and so is
(2).
Condition (4) is a frequency dependent, infinite dimen-
sional Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). Suppose that Π ∈
Rl∞. Then this matrix inequality can be converted into
a frequency independent finite dimensional LMI using the
Kalman-Yakubovich- Popov (KYP) Lemma.
Note that any IQC for 풟휏 immediately leads to an IQC for
풮휏 . For example, let 푤 = 풮휏푣 := 푣−풟휏푣. That 풟휏 satisfies
IQC defined by Π :=
[
Π11 Π12
Π∗12 Π22
]
implies 풮휏 satisfies IQC
defined by the following multiplier[
Π11 +Π12 +Π
∗
12 +Π22 −(Π12 +Π22)
−(Π∗12 +Π22) Π22
]
III. INTEGRAL QUADRATIC CONSTRAINTS FOR 풟휏 AND
풮휏
In this section, conically parameterized integral quadratic
constraint characterizations for operators 풟휏 and 풮휏 are
derived, which are crucial for applying IQC analysis to
systems with time-varying delays. To this end, we will first
present some l2-gain properties of operators 풟휏 and 풮휏 . To
facilitate the development, let us consider the following sets
of discrete-time sequences
Υ1 := {푠 : 푠[푘] ∈ {풯푚, 풯푚 + 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 풯푀}, ∀푘}
Υ2 := {푠 : 푠[푘] ∈ {풯푚, 풯푚 + 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 풯푀},
푀−1∑
푚=0
∣푠[푘 + 1 +푚]− 푠[푘 +푚]∣ ≤ 푑, ∀푘
}
.
where 푀 is a positive integer, and 풯푚, 푇푀 , and 푑 are
non-negative integers satisfying 푑 ≤ 풯푀 − 풯푚 + 1. In the
followings, let ℎ be 풯푀 − 풯푚 + 1.

IV. STABILITY CRITERIA FOR DISCRETE-TIME LTI
SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS
To further illustrate the IQC analysis of varying-time-
delay robustness presented in Section II, let us consider IQCs
defined by Π2 and Π3 (equations (12) and (13)) for 풟휏 and
풮휏 . Then 풮휏 satisfies IQC defined by
Πcomb :=
[
(푑+ 1)푋2 + ∣휙(e푗휔)∣2푋3 푋2
푋2 −푋2 −푋3
]
With this IQC, Theorem 1 leads to the following stability cri-
teria: the system is stable if there exists symmetric matrices
푋2 ≥ 0, 푋3 ≥ 0, and 휖 > 0 such that
퐺(e푗휔)∗((푑 + 1)푋2 + ∣휙(e푗휔)∣2푋3)퐺(e푗휔) +퐺(e푗휔)∗푋2
+푋2퐺(e
푗휔)−푋2 −푋3 ≤ −휖퐼, ∀휔 ∈ [−휋, 휋].
(16)
where 퐺(푧) := −(푧퐼 − (퐴 + 퐴푑))−1퐴푑. Let
(퐴휙, 퐵휙, 퐶휙, 퐷휙) be the minimum state space realization
of 휙(푧) ⋅ 퐼푛. Define
퐴푡 =
[
퐴+퐴푑 0
퐵휙 퐴휙
]
, 퐵푡 =
[
퐴푑
0
]
, 퐶푡 =
[
퐼푛 0

and 푀22 = −푋2 −푋3,
푀11 =
[
(푑+ 1)푋2 0
0 푋3
]
, 푀12 =
[−푋2
0
]
.
A finite dimensional formulation of stability criterion (16)
can be obtained by the KYP lemma: the system is stable if
there exist a symmetric matrices 푃 , 푋2 ≥ 0, and 푋3 ≥ 0
such that[
퐴′푡푃퐴푡 − 푃 퐴′푡푃퐵푡

V. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
Consider the following discrete-time system with a time-
varying delay
푥[푘 + 1] =
[
0.8 0
0.05 0.9
]
푥[푘] +
[−0.1 0
−0.2 −0.1
]
푥[푘 − 휏 ]
The example is taken from [4], and is also considered
in [3]. Assuming the rate of variation is arbitrarily, the
results presented in Table I are obtained by applying the
proposed IQC analysis, where IQCs utilized are defined by
Π1, Π3, and Π4. The results are compared against those
given in [4] and [3]. The IQC analysis gives better stability
boundaries than the criterion in [4] does, but is apparently
more conservative than the criterion in [3]. This clearly
indicates that there are more integral quadratic constraints
for operators 풟휏 and 풮휏 to be explored.
If we further assume that there exists an 푀 such that the
푀 -step average variation of 휏 is strictly less than 1, then
the IQC defined by Π2 becomes applicable. Utilizing this
and the IQCs defined by Π3 and Π4, we apply the proposed
IQC analysis and obtain the stability boundaries as listed
in Table II. First of all, we observe that when the average
variation of 휏 is restricted to be strictly less than 1, the
Assume the variation of 휏 is arbitrarily.

stability boundaries predicted by IQC analysis apparently be-
come bigger. Furthermore, the smaller the average variation
is, the bigger the upper bounds 풯푀 . Secondly, we observe
that for the case 푑/푀 ≤ 1/2, the predicted stability boundary
풯푀 = 20 is better than those predicted by [3] and [4]. Since
the notation “푀 -step average variation” was not introduced
in [3] and [4], this is not a fair comparison; nevertheless, it
shows that the notation is a useful concept which may reduce
conservatism of time-delay robustness analysis. Finally, we
observe that for a given upper bound of 푑/푀 , the predicted
stability boundary is independent of the lower bound of 휏 ,
풯푚. The information on 풯푚 somehow becomes useless in
this case. Whether it just happens for this particular example
or there is more to it requires further investigation.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this manuscript we present several l2-gain properties of
the discrete-time time-varying delay operator 풟휏 and “delay-
difference” operator 풮휏 := 퐼 − 풟휏 , as well as the resulting
IQC characterizations of these two operators. One of the new
contributions is to show what role the variation of the delay
sequence plays in regard to the energy amplification of 풟휏 ,
which allows us to better understand the behavior of 풟휏
and to derive less conservative stability criteria for verifying
varying-time-delay robustness. Numerical experiments are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed stability
criteria. The results indicate that one can reduce conservatism
of stability analysis by exploiting the information on the
variation of the delay sequence. They also show that there
are potentially more IQCs to be discovered for the operators
풟휏 and 풮휏 .
