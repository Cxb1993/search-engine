Abstract 
In this project, we study simultaneous system of 
vector n-functions equilibrium problem (SSVEP) 
since equilibrium problems includes many kinds 
of special cases, for example, optimization, 
variational inequality, complementary problem, 
saddle-point problem, etc.. We present existence 
results of the problem and continuities of the 
solutions mapping. We apply the Fan-Browder 
fixed-point theorem to study the existence of 
and the continuity of the solution mapping of 
SSVEP .Specially, some results concerning the 
lower semicontinuity of the solution mapping of 
SSVEP is established. The related interesting 
examples are given. 
Keywords ：  System of quasi-(vector)

algorithm. 
二、緣由與目的 
Decision in group often involves simultaneous 
(coordinated) choices and sequential 
(centralized) choices. Simultaneous decisions 
are in which all players try to make decisions 
based on what each thinks the others will do and 
in which no player has any information about 
the actions of the other players. Each player has 
to base his or her actions on what he or she 
thinks (or anticipates) the other player will do, 
eg., static games. Sequential decisions are those 
in which players make moves at different times 
or in turn. This means that players who move 
later have additional information about the 
actions of other players or states of the world, 
i.e., players who move first can often influence

We can see SSVEP as variant of the 
constraint set depends on the parameters then 
the SSVEP can be viewed as some kind of 
quasi-VEP. Our problem SSVEP can be viewed 
as some kind of simultaneous decision, that is, 
the decision maker i makes a decision according 
to the other decision makers’ opinion decision 
set  and his own preference  with 
dependences of .  is a framework of 
group decision and means that each decision 
maker choose his or her choices conditional on 
the additional information received during the 
other decision makers.  
W e distinguish from our problem     
(SSVEP) and the ordinalsystem     ofVEP as   
follows: The ordinalsystem ofVEP isto find        
x  K  s.t.  
 
forall  yi  K i, i  I↪ where .For  
the ordinalsystem   of VEP,we can see the     
references;e.g.[4,7].The m ain difference is        
that the ordinal system of VEP is not a        
fram ework of sequential decision    since it is   
only to find a decision     x based on individual   
decision m aker s ＇  opinion buttheinteraction    
of other  decision m akers. Thus the ordinal     
system ofVEP is not a fram ework ofgroup         
decision.We distinguish from our problem 
SSVEP and the ordinal system of VEP as 
follows: 
四、研究內容 
In this section, we first give some preliminaries 
that will be used in the rest of this paper then we 
will illustrate our main results based on them. 
Definition 1 (C-continuity, [8]) . Let X be a 
topological space, and Z a topological vector 
space with a partial ordering defined by a solid 
pointed convex cone C. Suppose that f is a 
vector-valued function from X to Z. Then, f is 
said to be C-continuous at x  if it satisfies 
one of the following three equivalent conditions: 
(i)  is open. 
(ii) For any neighborhood  of f(x), 
there exists a neighborhood  of x such 
that  for all . 
(iii) For any , there exists a 
neighborhood  of x such that 
 for all . 
Moreover a vector-valued function f is said to be 
C-continuous on X if f is C-continuous at every x 
on X. 
Remark 1. C-continuity and (-C)-continuity are 
the same as ordinary lower and upper 
semicontinuity, respectively, whenever  
and . With corresponding to ordinary 
functions, C-continuous function is called 
C-lower semicontinuous function, and 
(-C)-continuous function is called C-upper 
semicontinuous function. 
Definition 2. (Continuity for Set-valued 
mapping, see also [5]). Let X and Y be two 
6 
 co ¶y1 ,↪ym ♦  there exists 
 such that  
 
Definition 7 (Intersectional mapping [11]). Let 
X be a topological space and Z a nonempty set. 
Let , respectively. We say G is 
an intersectional mapping of T, if for each  
there exist a neighborhood  of x such that 
 
Definition 8. Let X be a topological space and Y 
a nonemptyset. A set-valued map  is 
said to have open lower sections, if the set  
, 
is open in X for every . 
Remark 3. If  has open lower 
sections then F is also lower semicontinuous on 
X and if F has an open graph then F has open 
lower sections are well-known facts. 
Definition 9. Let X be a topological space and Y 
a nonempty set. Suppose . We say that 
F can have open lower sections, if there a 
set-valued mapping  such that F’ 
has open lower sections and  for 
all . 
Now we state and prove our main results 
for SSVEP as follows: 
Theorem 1. Let I =  ı1↪…↪n℘ and  
For each  i  I,let  X i be a nonem pty subset    
ofa realHausdorfftopologicalvector space,       
Let  Zi be a real   
Hausdorff topological  vector space  
 with proper solid conve   x cone  
values, and 
defined by  
 
where x  X. Also we assum e that the      
following conditions:  
(i) for each ;  is are system diagonally   
quasiconcave; 
(ii) for each ;  is compact and convex; 
(iii) K has convex values and open lower 
sections; 
(iv) the set 
 
is open for each . 
Then SSVEP has at least one solution. 
To investigate sensitivity of    S,we m ay   
need to requireclosednessof     K .Thefollowing   
theorem is useful.   
Theorem 2. Let I =  ı1↪…↪n℘ and  
For each  i  I,let  X i be a nonem pty subset    
ofa realHa   usdorfftopologicalvector space,    
and  Let Zi be a  
real Hausdorff topological   vector space  
 with proper solid convex cone     
values, and 
defined by  
 
where x  X. Also we assum e that the      
following conditions:  
(i) SSVEP has at least one solution;      
(ii) the set   
is open for each    i  I and x  X. 
Then the set 
 
is nonem pty.  
Com bining Theorem s 3.1 and 3.2   , we  
have the following   consequence. 
Theorem 3. Let I =  ı1↪…↪n℘ and  
For each  i  I,let  X i be a nonem pty subset    
ofa realHausdorfftopologicalvector spac      e, 
Let  Zi be a real   
Hausdorff topological  vector space  
 with proper solid convex cone     
values,  and 
8 
defined by  
 
where x  X. Also we assum e that the     
following conditions:  
(i)  is nonempty for each  
(ii)  is compact; 
(iii)  is compact for each  and 
; 
(iv) K is u.s.c. on ; 
(v) the set 
 
is open for each i  I. 
Then  is usc on . 
This lsc result of SSVEP can let us 
consider the existence of MPEC or EPEC 
problems with  being as the lower-level 
solution mapping. In order to investigate the 
stability of SSVEP, we need the lsc of solution 
mapping of SSVEP. 
Theorem 7. Let  bea topologicalspace,    I =  
ı1↪…↪n℘ and Foreach   i  I,let  
X i be a nonem pty subsetofa realHausdorff        
topological vecto r space,  
Let  Zi be a real   
Hausdorff topological  vector space , 
 with proper solid convex    
cone values,  
  and 
defined by  
 
where x  X. Also we assum e that the     
following conditions:  
(i) The solution map of another version of 
SSVEP is nonempty, i.e., 
 
 is nonempty for each  
(ii)  is convex and compact for each  
and ; 
(iii) K is concave and usc on ; 
(iv)  defined by 
 is lsc with convex 
values on ; 
(v) fi is Ci-weakly quasiconcaveon    
for each  i  I; 
(vi) for each  i  I , the set 
 
is open. 
Then  is lsc on . 
Finally, combining Theorems 6 and 7, we 
have the following continuity result for the 
solution mapping , that is useful for 
numerical computing issues, for example, 
well-posedness and error bound, etc.. 
Theorem 8. Let  bea topologicalspace   , I =  
ı1↪…↪n℘ and Foreach   i  I,let  
X i be a nonem pty subsetofa realHausdorff        
topological vector space,   
Let  Zi be a real   
Hausdorff topological  vector space , 
 with proper solid convex    
cone values,  
  and 
defined by  
 
where x  X. Also we assum e th   at the  
following conditions:  
(i) The solution map of another version of 
SSVEP is nonempty, i.e., 
  is nonempty for each 
 
(ii)  is compact; 
(iii)  is convex and compact for each  
and ; 
(iv) K is concave and usc on ; 
(v)  defined by 
 is lsc with convex 
values on ;
