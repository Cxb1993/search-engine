三、 雙工器等效電路分析 (The Analysis of Diplexer Equivalent Circuit) 
Fig. 1 shows the schematic of a three-port diplexer consists of a common junction and two channel 
filters. The two channels have distinct center frequencies. The bandwidth of these two channels may be 
the same or different. Filters of separate specifications usually comprise this diplexer. As shown in the 
figure, the diplexer is excited  at Port 1 is by a source with internal resistance of 1 Ω, and Ports 2 and 3 
are terminated with two separate 1 Ω resistors. It is expected that the input signal at Port 1 can be well 
transmitted to Ports 2 and 3, respectively, according to the signal’s frequency. Therefore, the reflection 
coefficient should have two passbands with good return losses at Port 1. However, only one 
transmission band exists in the frequency responses of S21 and S31, respectively. Similar results can be 
deducted when the diplexer is excited at Ports 2 and 3, respectively.

Introducing the equivalent circuit of filters [1], [4] into Fig. 1, the lump-element equivalent circuit of a 
diplexer can be built as shown in Fig. 2. Two multi-coupled filters of orders NH and NL, center 
frequencies H0ω and L0ω , fractional bandwidths FBWH and FBWL, respectively, make up the required two 
channels. The resonant frequency of the ith resonator of these two filters is denoted as   ,0 H or LSSi =ω and the 
resistor   , H or LSSiR = models the loss of this resonator. The common junction is modeled by a three-port

5.20 =Lω GHz. The fractional bandwidths of these two channels are FBWH=FBWL=5%, the minimum 
return loss of these two channels is 20dB. The coupling coefficients of the two Chebyshev filters 
subjecting to these specifications can be easily calculated. Substituting these into (1)-(4), the return loss 
at Port 1 of this diplexer can be easily calculated by (5). Fig. 3 compares the calculated return loss with 
those of the individual filters. It is clear that due to the zero channel spacing, strong interaction occurs 
between the two composite filters. The return loss of this diplexer deviated greatly from those of the 
composite filters. The target of this design is to recover the response of the diplexer to those of the 
composite filters.

, where N=NH+NL, rzΩ  and rmΩ  represents the frequencies of reflection zeros and reflection maxima, 
respectively, over the two channels. These frequencies can be calculated from the transfer functions of 
the two channel filters [1]. The symbol RL is the specified minimum return loss over the two channels. 
The symbols 1tzimΩ  and 2tzimΩ  are the specified frequencies of finite transmission zeros for the two channel 
filters, respectively. The symbols 1tzimN  and 2tzimN  are the corresponding total numbers of finite 
transmission zeros ( 1tzimN = 2tzimN =0 in this case). The symbols fw , vw , 1pw  and 2pw  are the corresponding 
weightings of the cost function. The symbolΦ  represents the set of optimization variables. For this 
example, there are in total 18 variable coupling coefficients. These are HSm 1, , HHm 1,1 , HHm 2,1 , HHm 2,2 , HHm 3,2 , 
HHm 3,3 , HHm 4,3 , HHm 4,4 , LHHm ,4 , LSm 1, , LLm 1,1 , LLm 2,1 , LLm 2,2 , LLm 3,2 , LLm 3,3 , LLm 4,3 , LLm 4,4  and LLLm ,4 . However, in 
order to increase the efficiency, it is unnecessary to put all these coefficients into the set Φ . According 
to [7], the six coefficients ( HSm 1, , HHm 1,1 , HHm 2,1 , LSm 1, , LLm 1,1 , LLm 2,1 ) closed to the common junction can 
serve as the variables first. If the result is unsatisfied, a few variables can be added sequentially. For this 
example, four additional variables are included in order to obtain a satisfied result. These additional 
variables are HHm 2,2 , HHm 3,2 , LLm 2,2 , LLm 3,2 . The initial coupling coefficients are those of the composite 
filters. The cost function is evaluated by 1145 times during the optimization process. The variables

weaker and thus be easier to design as the channel spacing increase. In fact, it takes 762 and 481 times, 
respectively, cost function evaluations to complete the design of the one-channel spacing and two-
channel spacing diplexers. The total number of optimization variables reduces from ten (contiguous 
band and one-channel spacing diplexers) to eight for designing the two-channel spacing diplexer.

It is also interested to examine the variations of the coupling coefficients as the channel spacing 
varied. From this table, it is clear that the resonant frequencies of the designed resonators approach to 
those of channel filters (the approaching of iHiHm ,  and iLiLm , to zero) as the channel spacing increase. 
Except for HSm 1, , all the other couplings approach to those of the composite filters, as shown in Table I, 
as the channel spacing increase.

(six-pole). 
 
The proposed design method has also been used to successfully design the other diplexers composed 
by high order filters. Fig. 5 shows one of the design results. It is the response of a contiguous band 
diplexer composed by two six-pole Chebyshev filters. From the agreement between the diplexer’s 
response and those of the composite filters, the robustness of the proposed method is clearly 
demonstrated.

六、 結論  (Conclusions) 
An equivalent circuit network of a diplexer is presented in this report. The analysis method of this 
network is derived. An optimization technique is developed to design the diplexer to have the same 
return loss response as those of the composite filters. The effects of varying the channel spacing on the 
design variables are studied. The robustness of the proposed method is clear from the presented 
examples. A planar contiguous band diplexer was designed and fabricated, based on the equivalent 
circuit, to validate the design method.
