Abstract
To improve the efficiency of rare event simulation, the technique of im-
portance sampling is usually the best candidate. A number of successful
examples of applying importance sampling to rare event simulation exist
in queueing and reliability models. However, it is usually difficult and
time consuming to select an effective importance sampling distribution
for a particular model. Toalleviate such difficulty, we developed an adap-
tive algorithm for selecting effective importance sampling distributions for
queueing models. The numerical examples we conducted showed that the
porposed algorithm is effectiveness in reducing estimator’s variance.
Keywords: Adaptive algorithm, importance sampling, rare event,
queueing networks, simulation, variance reduction

Let ψ(θ) = logE exp(θXi) be the cumulant moment generating func-
tion of Xi. We make the following assumptions:
A1 X is a non-lattice random variable.
A2 There exist θ∗ > 0 such that θ∗ is the root of the equation ψ(θ) = 0.
A3 ψ(θ) <∞ for |θ| < θ0, 0 < θ∗ < θ0.
Assume X has a common density function f(·). Then, under A1-A3,
fθ(x) = exp(θx−ψ(θ))f(x) is also a density function. This specific change
of measure is called “exponential twisting” or “exponential tilting.” Let
us denote E(·) and P (·) as the expectation and probability under f(·),
and Eθ(·) and Pθ(·) as the expectation and probability under fθ(·).
Consider the indicator function
I(A) = 1 if A occurs, and I(A) = 0 otherwise. (2)
We estimate γx via “importance sampling” with twist θ by using an
estimator based on replications of
Zθ(x) = exp(−θST (x) + T (x)ψ(θ))I(T (x) < τ) = LT (x)(θ)I(T (x) < τ)
under Pθ, where LT (x)(θ) = exp(−θST (x)+T (x)ψ(θ)) is the likelihood ratio.
By the convexity property of ψ(·) and the fact that ψ′(0) = EX < 0, we
know ψ′(θ∗) > 0. Hence Eθ∗X > 0. Also, Pθ(T (x) < ∞) = 1 for θ in a
neighborhood of θ∗. Note that LT (x)(θ∗) reduces to exp(−θ∗ST (x)).
Results in Siegmund (1976) show that
arg minθVar(Zθ(x))→ θ∗, as x→∞,
and, under suitable regularity conditions,
Var(Zθ∗(x)) ∼ c · exp(−2θ∗x)− γ2x, as x→∞, (3)
for some constant c. (We write a(x) ∼ b(x) if limx→∞ a(x)/b(x) = 1.)
Thus, θ∗ is called the optimal twist and is a good value with which to do
importance sampling. In fact, Lehtonen and Nyrhinen (1992) show that
the exponential twist change of measure with parameter θ∗ is the unique
asymptotically optimal change of measure.
Now, we try to approximate θ∗ via simulation. For this purpose, we
need the following theorem due to Asmussen (1982).
Conditioned Limit Theorem for Random Walks
Let ⇒ denote weak convergence. Then under A1-A3, there exists a ran-
dom element (· · · , Y−1, Y0) of <{···,−1,0} such that
P ((· · · , XT (x)−1, XT (x)) ∈ ·|T (x) < τ)⇒ P ((· · · , Y−1, Y0) ∈ ·),
as x→∞, where (Y−n : n ≥ 0) has the property that
(· · · , Y−n−1, Y−n)⇒ (· · · , Z−1, Z0)

3. The probability that a customer who has completed service at node
i will go to node j is Pij (independent of the state of the system),
where i = 1, 2, . . . , d, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , d, and Pi0 indicates the proba-
bility that a customer will depart from the system from node i.
A generalized Jackson network is a Jackson network with the following
relaxation:
1. Inter-arrival times from the “outside” to node i are independent and
identically distributed, but can be non-exponentially distributed.
2. Services times at node i are independent and identically distributed,
but can be non-exponentially distributed.
We are interested in estimating the following performance measure
associated with such networks:
piK = the steady-state probability that the network population exceeds K.
Let us consider a d-node generalized Jackson network. Let Qi(·), Ai(·),
and Si(·) be the processes associated with the queue-length, interarrival
times, and service times of station i of the network. Specifically, we let
Qi(t) be the number of customers in service and in queue i at time t, Ai(·)
be the age process associated with the renewal exogenous arrival process
(since inter-arrival times are independent and identically distributed, the
arrival process is a renewal process; for general background on renewal and
the associated age processes, see, e.g. § 5 of Karlin and Taylor (1975))
at node i, and Si(·) be the age of the current customer that has been in
service at node i if Qi(t) > 0, and 0 otherwise. Then X = {X(t) : t ≥ 0}
is a Markov process, where
X(t) = (Q1(t), . . . , Qd(t), A1(t), . . . , Ad(t), S1(t), . . . , Sd(t)).
Let
Q(t) =
d∑
i=1
Qi(t),
i.e., Q(t) be the total network population of J at time t.
Let V be the set of states of X when Q(t) = 0 and define
t0 = 0 and, ti = inf{t > ti−1 : X(t) ∈ V,X(t−) 6∈ V } for i ≥ 1. (6)
We define a V -cycle to be the process between two successive epochs ti,
ti+1 at which X enters the set V . We let ν be the steady-state distribution
of X conditioned on X entering the set V , i.e.,
6
where φ1(·) = E[Y 2|·] and φ2(·) = E[Y |·]. Typically,
φi(X(TK)) = θ(1), i = 1, 2 as K →∞.
(We say a(n) = θ(b(n)) if there exist constants c1, c2 and n0 such that
c1 · b(n) ≤ a(n) ≤ c2 · b(n)
for all n ≥ n0.) Then, we expect that
Var(Y L) = θ(Var(LI(TK < T0)).
In other words, Var(Y L) behaves in roughly the same way as the vari-
ance of the estimator of γK for K large. Hence, an efficient change of
measure for estimating γK is the key to estimating piK .
It is straightforward to estimate γK . Notice that a generalized Jackson
network can be easily fit into a GSMP (Generalized Semi-Markov Pro-
cess) framework. Therefore, so long as we can compute an appropriate
importance sampling distribution, we can apply the importance sampling
technique for GSMP described in Section 4 of Glynn and Iglehart (1989)
to estimate γK .
The basic idea of obtaining an importance sampling distribution is as
follows.
Simulatem sample paths from the original network starting with initial
distribution ν and stop at min(TK′ , T0), where K
′ < K.
Similar to (4), we let
U¯ (j)m (K
′) =
∑m
i=1
∑N(i)
l=1 U
(j)
l I(Ti(K
′) < Ti(0))∑m
i=1N(i)I(Ti(K
′) < Ti(0))
,
where Ti(K
′) and Ti(0) are independent replications of TK′ and T0, U
(j)
l is
independent replications of the interarrival time at node j, and N(i) de-
notes the number of U
(j)
l generated for sample path i. We then compute
the importance sampling distribution for U (j) (interarrival time distribu-
tion at station j). We compute importance sampling distributions for V (j)
(service time distribution at station j) and M (j) (routing distribution at
station j) similarly.
四、 結果與討論
We consider a sequence of rare events {AK : K = 1, 2, . . .} ({Ax : x ≥ 0}),
and γK (γx)→ 0 denotes the probability of the rare event AK (Ax). From
the conditioned limit theorems of random walks (Asmussen, 1982; Igle-
hart, 1975), we usually can get an effective importance sampling distribu-
tion if we have samples conditioned on AK (Ax), when K (x) large, does
