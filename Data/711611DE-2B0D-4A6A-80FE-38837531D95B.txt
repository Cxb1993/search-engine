interference of a shallow dual-anchor is greater 
than that of a deep dual-anchor. For dual 
anchors with a deep overburden, the efficiency 
of anchor groups is about 95% as the pitch is 
75cm; the efficiency is up to 98% while the 
spacing is 150cm. The losing load mainly 
resulted from the grip sliding; the creep by the 
stratum and the steel strands is rarely small. 
Commonly, the maximum diameter of an 
anchor is found to be 15cm in Taiwan, the 
maximum number of installed strands is 12. 
Theoretically, twelve strands can provide 2200 
kN of break load; actually, they can provide 
merely 1900 kN of break load, because the grips 
made some scars on the strands. Consequently, 
most of deep anchors’ strands are broken during 
the pulled test, because the anchor capacity 
provided by the anchor body or stratum is much 
higher than that of strands. 
 
一、 前言 
台灣西部麓山地帶與台地卵礫石層分佈
廣闊，此處除了是人口密集且具發展潛力之
區域外，也是各項工程建設之重要位置。在
眾多的地工技術中，地錨是一種可以提供拉
力阻抗之地工構造物，其行為與拉力樁類似，
發展至今已被廣泛地使用在解決各種地工問
題上。截至目前為止，較完善之地錨文獻仍
著重於砂質地層之錨碇行為研究，對於卵礫
石層之研究甚少。當採用「砂質」土壤之數
據來進行卵礫石層中地錨之設計，其適用性
將令人質疑，因此就工程應用上而言，實有
必要對地錨在卵礫石層之錨碇行為做一深入
研究與探討。因此本年度計畫是在卵礫石層
中近行一系列的單錨與雙錨試驗，以瞭解於
卵礫石土中設計抗浮地錨的可行性與抗浮地
錨的受力與鎖碇後之行為。 
 
二、文獻回顧 
台灣西部地區卵礫石層主要分布於西北
部與中部之台地及麓山丘陵地，為第四紀晚
期之更新世沉積之地層，主要由成層之末固
結至半固結之沉積物所組成。其中卵礫石顆
粒從小於一公分至數十公分，變化甚大；其
間之細料可為塑性或非塑性材料，其含量可
超過 50%或低於 20%，並有輕微至完全未膠
結現象，其力學行為複雜而特殊。而台中盆
地的主要地層即為卵礫石層，其地層除淺層
有 0 至數公尺之粉質砂土層外，其下即為卵
礫石層。根據褚炳麟教授等人[1]的研究顯示，
卵礫石層的尖峰摩擦角∮p 可達 54.3°，殘餘摩
擦角∮r亦可達 44.9°。 
根據 Su 和 Fragaszy[2]的研究顯示，地錨
於預力鎖定後，提供了較好之韌性，因此有
取代拉力樁的趨勢。根據 Burland[3]的研究指
出，於非凝聚性的土壤中，壓力樁在位移達
1.5％的樁徑時，摩擦力即發揮其尖峰值，而
拉力樁將可能會更小。以直徑 60cm 的基樁而
言，僅容許有小於 0.9cm 之變形量。而以一
支極限荷重可達 1200kN 的地錨而言，若安全
係數 F.S.取 2，則鎖碇荷重為 600kN 左右，在
安置 8 根 12.7mm∮的鋼絞線，且自由段長度
為 4m 的情況下，可提供的彈性變形達 1.45cm，
再加上錨身與土壤間可提供的位移(約 2～
3cm)，因此，地錨的韌性約為基樁的 4 倍。
根據許世宗與吳俊茂[4]的研究指出，自由段
僅 1m，錨碇段為 3m 直徑 12cm 的地錨其尖
峰拉拔力可達 1600kN 以上。 
然至目前為止，所有的文獻並沒有一套
完整的卵礫石層中地錨設計圖表。因此本研
究針對台中的一個卵礫石層深開挖工地，進
行現場永久性抗浮地錨試驗，以瞭解地錨特
性，包括： 
1. 卵礫石層之基本參數性質。 
2. 地錨之荷重與彈-塑性變形量之關係。 
3. 地錨的極限拉拔與自由段長度及錨碇段長
度的關係。 
4. 潛變係數 Ks 與潛變極限荷重 Tlim 的推估。 
5. 群錨效應的探討：不同自由段、錨碇段和
間距之群錨效應係數。 
6. 摩擦損失與滑動損失的探討(含夾片咬合
之情形)。 
7. 地錨潛變與鋼絞線預力鬆弛之探討。 
 
三、卵礫石層基本性質之現場試驗 
3.1 卵礫石基本性質的試驗方法 
本研究的試驗地點位於台中市中港路二
段、河南路三段、市政北七路與朝富路等四
4 
 
3. 灌漿：分別為初灌、浪管內灌漿和加壓灌
漿。 
六、地錨試驗設備 
6.1 拉拔試驗設備 
拉拔設備如圖 8 和圖 9 所示，裝設過程
說明如下： 
1. 架設反力鋼樑(428*407*20*35mm)。 
2. 架設承壓鋼樑(250*250*14*14mm)及鋼鈑
(30cm*30cm*4cm)。 
3. 架設荷重計 (2000kN 以上 ) 與千斤頂
(2000kN 以上，衝程為 20cm)：首先將荷重
計穿過鋼絞線對準錨孔中心，架設在承壓
鈑上，然後在荷重計上方安裝一承壓鈑再
架設千斤頂，此時千斤頂、承壓鈑和荷重
計之中心均須調整與鋼絞線中心一致。最
後，將各索鋼絞線導入千斤頂和後拉錨頭
之錨孔內，並套入夾片夾住鋼絞線，以利
預力施拉。 
4. 架設位移計：本研究所使用之位移計
(LVDT)計衝程容量為 100mm，但所使用之
油壓千斤頂衝程為 200mm，在此情況下為
了能準確量得拉拔試驗過程中地錨之變位
量，當記讀器上顯示之位移量接近於
100mm 時，即調整位移計之支架並記錄調
整前之時間與變位量，以利電腦記讀後變
位量之計算，使所得變位量為一絕對值。 
5. 標示地表高程參考點：為了觀測淺層地錨
(T1～T3 和 G1，G2 地錨)於拉拔過程中地表
隆起情況，在儀器架設後，於地錨周邊地
表處以石灰作標記，並以水準儀測量各標
記之初始高程，於拉拔試驗後再測其高程，
計算地表隆起之高度。 
 
七、現場地錨試驗方法 
本研究共有 11 支單錨(T1~T11)與 6 組(12
支)群錨(T11~T23)證明試驗和 2 支單錨(T24 和
T25)適用性試驗。兩種試驗方法進行，說明如
下： 
1. 證明試驗[5]：本工址包括 T1～T11 的單錨
和 G1~G6(T12～T23)兩支一組的群錨拉拔試
驗。主要在於從荷重與塑性變形之關係，
以求取地錨極限拉拔荷重與群錨效應係數，
其中群錨試驗必需同時進行加載，而非個
別加載。 
2. 適用性試驗[5]：本研究中 T24 和 T25 地錨先
採用類似適用性試驗的方法進行試驗，於
荷重鎖定後再進行長期觀測。因適用性試
驗須考慮工作地錨之荷重係由千斤頂移轉
至鎖定器，因此可能產生抗張材滑動損失，
故於循環施拉完成後，應作一回不須維持
荷重之循環施拉，以求得抗張材之滑動損
失和摩擦損失。 
 
八、地錨試驗結果與分析 
為避免破壞產生在錨碇段的灌漿體，當
水泥漿體養護超過 2 個星期，單壓強度fୡᇱ大於
35MPa 時，才進行現場試驗。 
8.1 單錨的受力行為 
本研究之地錨屬摩擦型地錨，理論上其
拉拔力來自地盤與錨碇段水泥漿體間的摩擦
握裹力。但由現場試驗的觀測，淺層地錨之
破壞面延伸至地表時，會產生一個半徑約
90cm 的主要隆起範圍(表 2)，因此真正破壞面
並不在錨土介面上。也造成試驗結果要比原
先預測值還高（表 3）。圖 10 為 T4 地錨試驗
證明試驗結果，其試驗為劃分 5 階段進行加
載與解載之循環施拉後，再將地錨拉至破壞。
圖中顯示了極短的地錨長度，即有相當高的
錨碇力。圖 11 所示為不同自由段長度下，地
錨極限荷重與錨碇力之關係。由圖中可知，
地錨之極限荷重隨著錨碇段長度增加而增加，
可是當覆土深度的增加至 4m 時，地錨極限
荷重因受鋼絞線極限荷重(約 1900kN)控制，
其極限荷重皆維持在 1900kN 上下而與錨碇
段長度無關。而由圖 12 可看出短錨碇長度
(L=1.5m)地錨錨碇力明顯地隨覆土深度的增
加而增加；隨著錨碇段長度之增長其增加之
趨勢也趨於緩和；至地錨長度大於 4.5m 時已
受鋼絞線極限荷重控制，皆維持在 1900kN 的
拉拔力。若由潛變極限荷重來觀察其變化情
形，也和上述之結果差異不大，只是潛變極
限荷重受自由段覆土和錨碇段長度之影響較
明顯，如圖 13 和圖 14 所示。因此，在卵礫
石層中的地錨，若要使地錨之極限錨碇力突
破 1900kN，得有效提高鋼絞線的極限抗拉強
度，或地錨孔能容納更多支(12 支以上)的鋼絞
線。

量測），然後於荷重鎖碇之後再量測鋼絞線之
縮短量δ與時間的關係，再套用公式(2)計算出
各鋼絞線之鎖碇後的滑動損失。因各鋼絞線
於鎖碇後的滑動損失量並不一致，因此將所
有鋼絞線的損失值平均後再乘以總鋼絞線支
數，可得鎖碇後夾片造成之滑動損失量ΔP，
如下所示： 
∆P= δAE
L
                                             (2) 
δ：鋼絞線於鎖碇後之縮短量 
A：鋼絞線的截面積 
E：鋼絞線的楊氏模數 
L：鋼絞線可自由變形的長度 
T24和 T25地設計荷重皆假設為 600kN（設
計之安全因素取 FS=3）。因此本報告將 T24 與
T25 地錨初始荷重設定為 150kN 且皆拉至
900kN，然後鎖碇於 600kN，如圖 21 和圖 22
所示。經由計算可得兩支地錨之潛變極限荷
重分別為 1122kN 和 1085kN，符合規範之要
求（設計荷重應小於潛變極限荷重的1.5倍）。
儘管兩支地錨自由段鋼絞線的長度不一致，
但由圖中可發現其摩擦損失皆為 45kN，這意
味著摩擦損失僅來自千斤頂和錨頭，這應是
地錨為垂直致使自由段摩擦損失甚小。於鎖
碇時，千斤頂尚未解壓量得 T24 地錨鎖定荷重
600kN，T25 地錨鎖定荷重為 600kN。其後，
千斤頂解壓，可直接量得既存荷重（含有摩
擦損失），因此可算出夾片鎖碇滑動荷重損失
分別為 T24為 60kN；T25滑動損失則為 80kN，
平均約為 70kN。因此摩擦損失加上滑動損失
約為 120kN，約為設計荷重的 20%。此值將
為驗收試驗的重要依據。亦即地錨之鎖碇荷
重為設計荷重再加上 120kN。 
本試驗於鎖碇後，進行既存荷重與鋼絞
線縮短量隨時間變化的量測。圖 23 為初始既
存荷重隨時間變化的情形，圖中顯示既存荷
重隨時間之經過而減少，於經過 12.7 天時，
T24 地錨損失 14kN，T25 地錨損失 30kN，若以
百分比來比較其與規範之規定（圖 24），可看
出其值遠小於規範之規定。表 5 所示為鋼絞
線於鎖碇後之持續縮短量，經由公式(2)的計
算可得鎖碇後夾片之滑動損失分別為 T24 地
錨的 14kN 和 T25 地錨的 12kN。由此可知，既
存荷重之減少量其實大部分皆來自夾片的滑
動，地層與鋼絞線的潛變是非常有限的。 
結論 
本研究於卵礫石層中地下 21m 處進行抗
浮地錨單錨與雙錨之現地試驗，於研究過程
中可得下列結論： 
1. 地錨於卵礫石層中可提供相當大之錨碇
力。 
2. 地錨在0.5MPa~ 1MPa的灌漿壓力下，發現
如此的水泥漿配比(W/C)≦0.5 與灌漿壓力
會產生滲透灌漿的現象，大致會使 15cm 直
徑的鑽孔擴大至 20cm~30cm 的直徑，經由
量測多處得平均直徑約為 23cm。 
3. 本研究過程，並無破壞面發生於鋼絞線與
水泥漿體間，因此在如此鋼絞線系統的排
列下，鋼絞線與水泥漿體間的極限握裹力
τb可達2.3MPa，此值約為日本規範的 2倍。 
4. 於地錨施拉過程，鋼絞線皆有夾片之咬痕，
主要為錨頭夾片孔尺寸太小與夾片剛度較
高所致，此情形造成長地錨極限荷重受鋼
絞線控制。 
5. 淺層地錨受群錨互制效應的影響大於深層
地錨，深層雙錨間距於 75cm 拉拔，其群錨
效應係數高達 95%；間距於 150cm 拉拔，
群錨效應係數高達 98%。 
6. 地錨鎖定後的荷重損失主要是來自夾片的
滑動，地層與鋼絞線的潛變是非常小的。

form the fixed length. The applied load is passed through the sheathed strands to the bladed device 
which is used as an anchorage body; therefore, the grouting body of the fixed length undergoes 
compressive stress. The anchor can be classified as a type of a compression anchor according to the 
mechanism of the load transfer within the fixed end.

Anchorage capacity of an anchor comes from the friction load and the end bearing. Hsu and 
Liao [2] illustrated that when a model anchor with length/diameter ratio L/D of 5 was pulled, the 
total load, shaft friction and end bearing do not reach their peaks simultaneously. When the shaft 
friction reaches its maximum value, the end bearing is still small; when the end bearing is at its 
maximum value, the shaft friction is at its residual value. Additionally, if punch shear failure occurs 
under the anchor top, the end bearing has no peak value. 
The researches of anchor behavior are numerous and integrated. With regard to the numerical 
analysis, seldom using a complete stress-strain curve of soil to analyze the anchor behavior [3-6], 
therefore a fair load-displacement relationship could not be calculated precisely.  
Hsu [7] suggested a model that could simulate the both strain hardening/softening and volume 
dilatancy of cohesionless soil during shearing, which is named SHASOVOD model. This study 
employed the soil model, along with the commercial software FLAC2D, to evaluate the uplift 
behavior of under-reamed anchors in silty sand. To demonstrate the applicability of the numerical 
program for examining the behavior of under-reamed anchors, the numerical results were verified 
by the tested results. A fair load-displacement curve for the under-reamed anchor was then 
established. 
 
Constitutive Model and Numerical Meshes 
The soil specimen used in triaxial tests that was sampled from Taipei Basin. It was classified as an 
SP-SM soil (Poorly graded sand to silty sand); its specific gravity Gs was 2.69; its maximum dry 
density was 15.8 kN/m3, and its minimum dry density was 13.7 kN/m3. 
The constitutive model that was proposed by Hsu [7] was adopted herein to model the 
stress-strain behavior of sandy soil. The model was based on theory of plasticity and the 
non-associated flow rule. Table 1 presents the constitutive equations and the related parameters for 
the silty sand. As shown in Table 1b, all parameters can be correlated to the triaxial results in terms 
of the relative density and the confining pressure. As displayed in Fig. 1, the calculated results are 
perfectly consistent with the triaxial test results. Similarly, the stress-strain behavior of silty sands 
with relative densities of 30% and 70% could also be closely simulated by this model.

Verification of Numerical Results 
Figure 4 presents the dimensions of the test anchors and the subsoil conditions of two tested sites in 
Taipei Basin. Tested anchors were pulled out following the proving test procedure, as recommended 
by Deutsche Industrie Norm, DIN [8]. First, an initial load was applied to the anchor, which was 
then stressed in five loading-unloading cycles. After five loading cycles had been completed, the 
tested anchor was pulled out to failure.

Fig. 4. Subsoil conditions and dimensions of tested anchors  
 
The fixed end is made of cement grout. Its Young's modulus Ec was estimated to be 
approximately 27 GPa. As displayed in Fig. 4, two test anchors were virtually anchored in silty 
soils; each soil has its own SPT blow count. According to Meyerhof [9], the relationship between 
the relative density Dr and SPT-N value of cohesionless soil, the relative density of in situ sandy 
soil can be determined. The aveN  values of the two test sites are 15 and 21, and approximate Dr 
values of 30% and 40% are obtained for the soils at these two test sites. 
The anchor head displacement, Sh, measured during the pull test is divided into two parts- the 
displacement of the fixed anchor end, St and the elastic elongation, Se. To compare the St that was 
calculated numerically with the anchor head displacement, Sh, that was measured in the anchor test, 
the elastic elongation of steel strand, Se, must be added to the numerically determined value St. As 
plotted in Fig.5, the load-displacement curves of two under-reamed anchors calculated numerically 
are consistent with those measured from field tests. Therefore, the numerical program was very 
suitable to investigate the uplift behavior of the under-reamed anchor in silty sand.

Conclusions 
According to the results of triaxial tests on silty sand, field tests and numerical analyses on 
under-reamed anchors, following conclusions can be drawn.  
1. All the parameters needed for the constitutive model SHASOVOD can be expressed as functions 
of the confining pressure and the relative density of soil. After being compared with the triaxial 
test results, the deviatoric stress-axial strain and volumetric strain-axial strain behaviors could 
be accurately represented by this model. 
2. The load-displacement behaviors calculated numerically much consisted with those measured 
by two field tests for different dimensions of under-reamed anchors. 
3. The total load, friction load and end bearing do not reach their peaks simultaneously. When the 
friction load reaches its peak value, the end bearing is still small; when the end bearing develops, 
the friction load is in a residual state.  
4. Since shallow- and deep-embedded anchors show distinctive behaviors in the end resistance 
development, a critical overburden depth H of 6D was found to classify as a shallow or a deep 
anchor which install in silty sand with relative density Dr of 50%.

CONSTITUTIVE MODEL AND NUMERICAL PROCEDURE 
 
The sand specimen was sampled from I-Lan had a D10 of 0.16 mm, D30 of 0.25 mm, D60 of 0.39 
mm, a coefficient of uniformity of 2.44, a coefficient of gradation of 1.0 and a fines content (< #200) 
of 1%. It was an SP soil; its specific gravity Gs was 2.69; its maximum dry density was 17.34 
kN/m3, and its minimum dry density was 13.70 kN/m3. 
The constitutive model that was proposed by Hsu and Liao (1998) was adopted herein to model 
the stress-strain behavior of sand. The yield function f is

where 1  represents the major principal stress; 3  is the minor principal stress, and *  is the 
mobilized friction angle, which is a function of the accumulative plastic strain p . A plastic 
potential function g was required for a nonassociated flow rule, and can be expressed as

where *  is the mobilized dilatancy angle, which is also a function of the accumulative plastic 
strain p . Hsu and Liao (1998) presented further information of the model details and related 
parameters. Fig. 2 shown that the modeled results are consistent with the triaxial test results for the 
sand with Dr=70%.  
To cut down the time consumption, one-half symmetric meshes were utilized for the dual 
anchors; and as shown in Fig. 1b, one-quarter symmetric meshes were employed for the triple 
anchors. Figure 1b also illustrated the notations of an anchor group. To minimize the boundary 
effects, a distance of 40D between the anchor and the side boundary, and a net distance 5D between 
the anchor base and the bottom boundary. The boundary constraint condition was set by use of 
rollers.

anchor is categorized as a deep anchor. As shown in Fig. 4 was the experimental and numerical 
load-displacement relationships of dual anchors which have a vertical distance of 5.5D and a 
horizontal distance of 3D between two anchors. The load-displacement behaviors calculated 
numerically consisted with those measured by experimental tests. Fig.4 (a) which is the upper 
anchor with Z/D of 4.5 shows that total load increases with as the anchor displacement increases 
until the peak occurs; then declines markedly from peak to residual, this phenomenon was found on 
shaft friction as well. The end bearing also behaves the pre-peak and post-peak, therefore this 
anchor is a typically shallow anchor. Contrastively, a deep anchor the end bearing of bottom anchor 
with Z/D of 10 develops a different behavior, increasing continuously without a peak; accordingly, 
the total load initially declines and then increases with as the anchor displacement increases in the 
post-peak stage. Since there is no peak can be found on the end bearing curve of a deep anchor, this 
study adopted the suggestion by Trautmann and Kulhawy (1988) to determine the end-bearing 
capacity, which was entitled yielding end bearing qyQ . Fig. 4 shows that total load, shaft friction and 
end bearing do not reach summit simultaneous, when the friction load reaches its peak value, the 
end bearing develops yet; when the end bearing develops, the friction load is in a residual state. 
Therefore, strain softening behavior and displacement-increments control were two important keys 
for numerical anchors.

Interferences of dual anchors with a variety of vertical spacings 
 
The efficiency of an anchor group Eg was defined as Q
Q
E gg  ( gQ is anchor group capacity, Q is 
sum of individual anchor capacities of group). Both Fig. 5(a) and (b) were efficiencies of the upper 
anchor and the bottom anchor under a constant horizontal spacing Sh of 3D and a variety of vertical 
spacings. Analysis results illustrated that end bearings of these two anchors are affected by the 
vertical spacing more seriously than those shaft frictions. For the upper anchor, total load, peak (or 
yielding) end bearing and peak friction increase at a decreasing rate with as vertical spacing 
increases; when the vertical spacing to diameter ratio Sv/D is greater than 7.5, there is virtually no 
interference on dual anchors. The bottom anchor is interfered by the vertical spacing more than the 
upper anchor; moreover, total load and end bearing increase at increasing rate with as the Sv/D 
increases. However, when the Sv/D is larger than 7.5, interference can be neglected. The shaft 
friction of the bottom anchor seems to be influenced less than the total load and the end bearing.  
 
Disturbance of triple anchors under a variety of horizontal spacings 
    
Triple anchors which ranked in a line were embedded in same depth herein to study the 
interactive behavior, the paired anchors which analyzed by Wang (2003) was then employed to 
compare mutually. According to numerical consequences, the middle anchor of the triple anchors is 
affected gravely than the other anchors; this study utilized the average of three anchors (the 
load-displacement curves of three anchors was superposed, the load was then divided 3) to

Yielding of soil around triple anchors 
 
Fig.8a illustrated the yielding of soil around shallowly triple anchors(Z/D=4) with very close 
horizontal spacing of Sh=2D, owing to anchors are very near each other, the yield zones of each 
anchor highly superposes, the entirely yielding zone develops toward ground. When horizontal 
pitches Sh=10D, each anchor almost forms independently yielding zone (Fig. 8b). A little bit similar 
to the shallow anchors’ behavior occurs in the deep (Z/D=10) triple anchors, as displayed in Fig. 9; 
theoretically, for a deeply single anchor, the yield zone should not develop to ground, and is similar 
to Fig.9b; however, yield zone still expands to ground for the deeply triple anchors when Sh=2D.

Anchorage capacity of an anchor comes from the friction load and the end bearing. Hsu and 
Liao [2] illustrated that when a model anchor with length/diameter ratio L/D of 5 was pulled, the 
total load, shaft friction and end bearing do not reach their peaks simultaneously. When the shaft 
friction reaches its maximum value, the end bearing is still small; when the end bearing is at its 
maximum value, the shaft friction is at its residual value. Additionally, if punch shear failure occurs 
under the anchor top, the end bearing has no peak value. 
The researches of anchor behavior are numerous and integrated. With regard to the numerical 
analysis, seldom using a complete stress-strain curve of soil to analyze the anchor behavior [3-6], 
therefore a fair load-displacement relationship could not be calculated precisely.  
Hsu [7] suggested a model that could simulate the both strain hardening/softening and volume 
dilatancy of cohesionless soil during shearing, which is named SHASOVOD model. This study 
employed the soil model, along with the commercial software FLAC2D, to evaluate the uplift 
behavior of under-reamed anchors in silty sand. To demonstrate the applicability of the numerical 
program for examining the behavior of under-reamed anchors, the numerical results were verified 
by the tested results. A fair load-displacement curve for the under-reamed anchor was then 
established. 
 
Constitutive Model and Numerical Meshes 
The soil specimen used in triaxial tests that was sampled from Taipei Basin. It was classified as an 
SP-SM soil (Poorly graded sand to silty sand); its specific gravity Gs was 2.69; its maximum dry 
density was 15.8 kN/m3, and its minimum dry density was 13.7 kN/m3. 
The constitutive model that was proposed by Hsu [7] was adopted herein to model the

with relative densities of 30% and 70% could also be closely simulated by this model.

Fig. 4. Subsoil conditions and dimensions of tested anchors  
 
The fixed end is made of cement grout. Its Young's modulus Ec was estimated to be 
approximately 27 GPa. As displayed in Fig. 4, two test anchors were virtually anchored in silty 
soils; each soil has its own SPT blow count. According to Meyerhof [9], the relationship between 
the relative density Dr and SPT-N value of cohesionless soil, the relative density of in situ sandy 
soil can be determined. The aveN  values of the two test sites are 15 and 21, and approximate Dr 
values of 30% and 40% are obtained for the soils at these two test sites. 
The anchor head displacement, Sh, measured during the pull test is divided into two parts- the 
displacement of the fixed anchor end, St and the elastic elongation, Se. To compare the St that was 
calculated numerically with the anchor head displacement, Sh, that was measured in the anchor test, 
the elastic elongation of steel strand, Se, must be added to the numerically determined value St. As 
plotted in Fig.5, the load-displacement curves of two under-reamed anchors calculated numerically 
are consistent with those measured from field tests. Therefore, the numerical program was very 
suitable to investigate the uplift behavior of the under-reamed anchor in silty sand.

Conclusions 
According to the results of triaxial tests on silty sand, field tests and numerical analyses on 
under-reamed anchors, following conclusions can be drawn.  
1. All the parameters needed for the constitutive model SHASOVOD can be expressed as functions 
of the confining pressure and the relative density of soil. After being compared with the triaxial 
test results, the deviatoric stress-axial strain and volumetric strain-axial strain behaviors could 
be accurately represented by this model. 
2. The load-displacement behaviors calculated numerically much consisted with those measured 
by two field tests for different dimensions of under-reamed anchors. 
3. The total load, friction load and end bearing do not reach their peaks simultaneously. When the 
friction load reaches its peak value, the end bearing is still small; when the end bearing develops, 
the friction load is in a residual state.  
4. Since shallow- and deep-embedded anchors show distinctive behaviors in the end resistance 
development, a critical overburden depth H of 6D was found to classify as a shallow or a deep 
anchor which install in silty sand with relative density Dr of 50%.
