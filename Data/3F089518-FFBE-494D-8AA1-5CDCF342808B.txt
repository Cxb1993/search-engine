The microwave dielectric properties and 
the microstructures of ZnO-doped 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics prepared by 
conventional solid-state route have been 
studied. Doped with ZnO (up to 0.75 wt%) can 
effectively promote the densification of 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics with low sintering 
temperature.  At 1320oC, La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 
ceramics with 0.75 wt% ZnO addition 
possesses a dielectric constant (εr) of 30.2, a 
Q×f value of 73000 GHz (at 8GHz) and a 
temperature coefficient of resonant frequency 
(τf) of -35 ppm/oC.  The ZnO-doped 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics can find applications

2. Introduction 
 
In order to achieve miniaturization of the 
dimensions of the devices and for the system 
work with high efficiency and stability, many 
researches have been focusing on developing 
dielectric materials with high quality factor 
(Q×f), high dielectric constant (εr) and zero 
temperature coefficient of resonant frequency 
(τf) for the use of dielectric resonator and 
microwave device substrate.  High dielectric 
constant material can effectively reduce the 
size of resonators.  The inverse of the 
dielectric loss is required to be high for 
achieving prominent frequency selectivity and 
stability in microwave transmitter components 
and small temperature coefficient of the 
resonant frequency is to ensure the stability of 
the microwave components at different 
working temperature. Several complex 
perovskites ceramics A(B′1/2B″1/2)O3 (A = Me2+, 
Me3+?B′ = Me2+, Me3+?B″ = Me4+, Me5+, Me6+) 
have been reported due to their excellent 
microwave dielectric properties [1-6].  Among 
these materials, Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 (Ln = La, Sm, 
Nd, Dy, Y) ceramics, has been widely used as 
substrate for superconducting microwave 
devices since it provides a high quality factor, 
excellent lattice matching and a good matching 
for thermal expansion [5-7].   
Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions which were 
measured quality factor (Q×f) of the ceramic 
specimens was larger than 30000 (GHz) and 
dielectric constant revealed between 22 and 27 
have noncubic symmetry and the GdFeO3-type 
structure [5].  Since La(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 has a 
dielectric constant ( rε ) of 29, a quality factor 
(Q×f) of 75500 (GHz) and a temperature 
coefficients of resonant frequency (τf) of –65, it 
is one of Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions was 
determined to be suitable substrates for 
YBa2Cu3OX thin film and resonator used in 
microwave applications.  In addition, because 
of the ion radius of Co+2 (0.082nm) is similar to 
that of Mg+2 (0.078nm), the ion of Mg+2 can be 
substituted by the ion of Co+2 to form 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions.  It also 
possesses suitable microwave dielectric 
properties ( rε ~ 30, Q×f ~ 67000 GHz, τf 
~ –63.7 ppm/°C at sintering temperature of 
1440oC) for applications in dielectric resonators 
[8].  However, the sintering temperatures of 
conventional microwave dielectric ceramics 
used for dielectric resonators, filters and other 
communication devices normally at 
1200-1400oC.  For practical applications, it is 
necessary to reduce the sintering temperature of 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics.  Low melting glass 
addition, chemical processing and small particle 
sizes of the starting materials are generally 
advantageous to reduce the sintering 
temperature of dielectric materials [9-12].  In 
the past, liquid phase flux such as ZnO were 
added to lower the sintering temperature of 
ceramics [13].  In this report, ZnO was added 
to further lower the sintering temperature. The 
crystalline phases, the microstructures and the 
microwave dielectric properties of ZnO-doped 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics were investigated.  
 
3. Experimental Procedure 
 
Sample of La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 was prepared 
using conventional solid-state method from 
individual high-purity oxide powders(>99.9%):

The surface microstructural photographs of 
ZnO-doped La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 sintered at 
temperatures 1260-1410°C are presented in Fig. 
3. The porosity decreased with increasing 
sintering temperature and no pore was observed 
at 1320oC with 0.75wt% ZnO addition owing to 
grain growth.  In addition, the grain size also 
increased with the increase of sintering 
temperature as well as amount of ZnO addition 
due to sintering aid. At the level of 0.75 wt% 
ZnO addition, porous specimens were observed 
at the sintering temperature of 1260oC and 
1290°C.  However, rapid grain growth 
appeared for La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 specimen with 
ZnO additions at higher sintering temperatures.  
These may directly affect the microwave 
dielectric properties of the La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 
samples.

temperatures 
 
Table I shows the EDS data of grain 
boundaries of La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics with 
0.75wt% ZnO additions and various sintering 
temperatures. It revealed that the grain 
boundaries of the La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics with 
0.75wt% ZnO addition have the same ion with 
La, Co and Ti. However, it also exhibited 
Zn-rich liquid phases at grain boundaries for 
specimens with 0.75wt% ZnO addition. The 
formation of liquid phases are attributed to the 
addition of ZnO. On the other hand, it also 
detected that ZnO was minor sublimated at 
higher sintering temperature, which is believed 
to significantly affect the microwave dielectric 
properties of the ceramic samples.

0.75wt% ZnO addition at various sintering temperatures 
 
 
The plots of density and dielectric constant 
of the ZnO-doped La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics at 
different sintering temperature are demonstrated 
in Fig. 4  It indicated that densities of 5.58- 
5µm 
but also a revealed reduction in lattice 
imperfection and dielectric loss, the increase in 
the Q×f values for highly ZnO-doped 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics could be a result of 
the grain morphology. That would explain the 
increase in Q×f values for La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 
ceramics with increasing amount of ZnO 
addition. The temperature coefficient of 
resonant frequency is well known related to the 
composition, the additives and the second phase 
of the material. It varied from average –56 
to –32 ppm/°C as the amount of ZnO addition 
increased from 0.25 to 0.75 wt%. Significant 
change was not observed in the τf value with 
fixed ZnO addition at different sintering 
temperatures. However, it revealed the τf values 
were varied toward the positive direction with 
increasing ZnO content due to the formation of 
the grain boundary phase. It implies that the τf 
value was not sensitive to the sintering 
temperature. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The dielectric properties of ZnO-doped 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics have been 
investigated. A large sintering temperature 
reduction (about 100°C) can be achieved by 
adding ZnO to the La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics. 
The dielectric properties of ZnO-doped 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics were relatively higher 
than the dielectric properties of purity 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics ( rε ~ 30, Q×f ~ 67000 
GHz, τf ~ –63.7 ppm/°C at sintering 
temperature of 1440oC) due to sintering aid. 
With 0.75 wt% ZnO addition, a dielectric 
constant of 30.2, a Q×f value of 73000 (GHz) 
and a τf value of –35 ppm/°C were obtained for 
La(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics at 1320°C for 6 h.

(Ba,Sr)TiO3 will be needed for storage capacitors.  The use of such thin films that are fabricated 
with high dielectric constant materials makes it possible to reduce the size of storage capacitors, and 
to simplify the memory cell structure for higher integration density.  On the other hand, these 
prepared thin films are also capable in reducing the dimension of device in communication 
integrated circuit system. Many techniques have employed to produce (Zr,Sn)TiO4 thin films, 
sputtering , pulsed laser, sol-gel deposition [12-14]. These films can be used in dynamic random 
access memories (DRAMs) and wireless communication devices. In addition, sol-gel deposition has 
also proved to be a simple and inexpensive method particularly useful for large area application. 
This attracted our attention, and we investigated ZnO-doped (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 (ZST) thin films 
because its excellent dielectric properties [15]. In this article, by using sol-gel deposition method, 
ZnO-doped ZST thin films were fabricated and their structural, optical and electrical properties 
were investigated for different heat-treated temperatures.  The results provide evidence that the 
heat-treated temperature greatly affect and dependence of the structure, optical and electrical 
characteristics as a function of heat treatment. 
 
EXPERIMENTIAL PROCEDURES 
 
Films deposition were prepared by using sol-gel process, as shown in Fig. 1. High purity 
zirconium propoxid (Zr⋅C12H28O4), titanium isopropoxide (Ti⋅C12H28O4), tin chloride pentahydrate 
(SnCl4⋅5H2O), and 1 wt% 30nm particle size ZnO powder were selected as start precursors. 
2-propanol [(CH3)2CHOH] was used as a solvent.   The mixture precursor solution was 
spin-coated directly on ITO/Glass substrate to form a uniform film at room temperature. After each 
spin coating process, sample was heat-treated with different temperatures (250 ~ 450oC) for 15min  
in air atmosphere. This step is repeated five times, and the films were annealed in air atmosphere at 
800oC for 30 min.  The film structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku ATX-E).  
The morphology of the film surface was determined using an atomic force microscope (AFM, 
Digital Instrument DI3000).  
On the other hand, the electrical properties of the ZST thin films were evaluated by 
capacitance-voltage (C–V) and current-voltage (I–V) measurements.  The test samples with 
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor structures were prepared on glass substrates.  The sample 
devices (Pt/ZnO-doped ZST/ITO/Glass) were fabricated by symmetrically depositing Pt electrodes 
(diameter 1mm) on top side of the ZST/ITO/Glass structure. The optical transmittance spectra of the 
ZnO-doped ZST/ITO/Glass were measured by using UV-visible recording spectrophotometer.  All 
electrodes were prepared by using ion sputtering.  The C-V and the I-V curves of the MIM 
capacitors were measured by using a HP4284 LCR meter and a HP4155 Parameter Analyzer, 
respectively.

and the root-mean-square (Rms) roughness of the films increased as the heat-treated temperature 
increased.  The corresponding Rms roughness of ZnO-doped ZST thin films obtained from AFM 
images reveals that the surface roughness increased from 2.355 nm to 5.324 nm as the heat-treated 
temperature increased from 250oC to 450oC.  This result may be because higher kinetic energies 
would be damaged the microstructure. Therefore, suitable heat-treated temperature causes a more 
surface energy, which improves the surface morphology of the growing film.

Figure 4 shows the transmittance spectra of ZnO-doped ZST thin films deopisted on

average tansmission in the visible is ranged over 80% and does not depend on the wavelength and 
heat-treated temperature.

CONCLUSION 
 
Crystalline of nano-particle 1wt% ZnO-doped ZST thin films deposited on ITO/Glass by 
sol-gel method was investigated.  The intensity of the peaks ZST (111) deposited at heat-treated 
temperature of 250oC for 15 min was higher than others.  Surface roughness was improved with 
decreased heat-treated temperature. When the heat-treated temperature decreased, the quality of the 
ZST thin films improved at the same time.  Suitable heat-treated temperature causes a more 
surface energy, which effects the surface morphology of the growing film.  In the optical 
transmission spectra, the ZnO-doped ZST thin films present highly transparency (over 80%) in the 
wave range 400nm~600nm of visible region. The MIM structure was introduced in the 
measurement of C–V and I–V curves for the ZnO-doped ZST thin films. A high dielectric constant 
of 18 (f = 1 MHz) and a low leakage current density of 8.7×10-9 A/cm2 were obtained for the 
prepared films.  It may find applications in dynamic random access memories and wireless 
communication devices.
