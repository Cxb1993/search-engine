same time. Spatial diversity provides diversity gain to mitigate fading effects by using 
the multiple (ideally independent) copies of the transmitted signal in space, time and 
frequency. They are usually trade-offs to each other and provide an effective and 
promising solution while achieving high-data rate and reliable transmission. 
The major MIMO signal detection schemes include linear detection, successive 
interference cancellation (SIC) [7], [8] and the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. 
The advantages of the first two detection schemes are low decoding complexity and 
easy implementation but their detection performances are non-optimal. ML detection 
provides optimal detection performance but its complexity increases exponentially 
with the size of constellation and the number of transmit antennas. Therefore, the 
design of high-performance and low decoding complexity is the one of key issues of 
MIMO designs. To reduce the complexity of the ML detector, the sphere decoding 
algorithm (SDA) [9], [10] has received considerable attention as an efficient detection 
scheme for MIMO systems. However, typical SDA fail to work in underdetermined 
MIMO systems where the number of transmit antennas is larger than the number of 
receive antennas. 
To overcome the above drawbacks of typical SDA, the conventional generalized 
sphere decoder (GSD), double-layer sphere decoder (DLSD) and slab sphere decoder 
(SSD) are introduced in [11-15]. These decoders transform underdetermined systems 
into overdetermined systems that can be solved by the SDA. Since the GSD performs 
an exhaustive search on ( t rN N− ) dimensions for the ML solution, the decoding 
complexity is increasing with the size of constellation and the antenna number 
difference. The DLSD uses the outer sphere decoder to find the valid candidate points 
and then the inner sphere decoder uses those points to find the solution. The SSD uses 
the geometry concept to find the valid candidate points to reduce the searching 
complexity of DLSD. However, the SDA still needs to be performed too many times

Chapter 2  
 
Underdetermined MIMO System 
Model 
Many MIMO technologies are implemented in order to achieve the multiplexing 
gain and more diversity gain for wireless communication system. But in some 
scenarios (e.g. a strong LoS signal at receiver), an overdetermined MIMO system can 
be degraded into an underdetermined MIMO system. In underdetermined MIMO 
systems, the well-known SDA fail, therefore we need some special decoding schemes 
for these cases. In this chapter, those technologies of MIMO systems are introduced. 
We first introduce the MIMO system model in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 introduces the 
channel capacity. Second, the spatial diversity (SD) and the spatial multiplexing (SM) 
techniques are introduced in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, respectively. Finally, the 
commonly used detection schemes for underdetermined MIMO systems including 
generalize sphere decoder (GSD), and Slab-sphere decoder (SSD) will be given in 
Section 2.5.

2.2 Channel Capacity 
Channel capacity is the upper bound of data rates in bits per channel that can be 
reliably transmitted over a communication channel. In other words, by channel coding 
theorem, if the data rate of transmission is below the channel capacity, the transmitted 
signals can be recovered with an arbitrarily small error probability. First, we introduce 
the single-input-single-output (SISO) channel capacity. Second, the MIMO channel 
capacity is introduced. The channel capacity is defined as [16]

C X Y=  (2.6) 
where 
 I( ; ) H( ) H( | ),X Y Y Y X= −  (2.7)

When the channel knowledge is unknown to the transmitter, the optimal transmit 
signals are chosen to be independent and equal power. With independent and uniform 
power distribution, the covariance matrix of the transmit signal vector is then given by 
rxx N=R I . As a result, the ergodic capacity of a MIMO system can be written as [1]

2.3 MIMO Diversity 
Diversity techniques are widely used in MIMO systems to improve the reliability 
of transmission without increasing the transmit power or bandwidth. There are many 
diversity techniques such as space, frequency and time diversity. In this section the 
space diversity is introduced, it is so called antenna diversity. 
2.3.1 Receive Diversity 
Receive diversity involves the receiver with multiple antennas. At the receiver, 
multiple copies of the transmitted signal are received, which can be efficiently 
combined with an appropriate signal processing algorithm. There are four main types 
of combining techniques, include selection combing, switch combining, equal-gain 
combining (EGC) and the maximum ratio combining (MRC). 
1. Selection combining – The received signal with the best quality is chosen 
and the choosing criterion is based on SNR.  
2. Switch combining – Switch the received signal path to an alternative 
antenna when the current received signal level falls below a given threshold.  
3. EGC – It is a simple method since it does not require estimation of the 
channel. The receiver simply combines the received signals from different 
receive antennas with weights set to be equal.  
4. MRC – It forms the output signal by a linear combination of all the 
received signals and is the optimal combination technique which achieves 
the maximum value of the output SNR.

Diagonal Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (D-BLAST) 
The concept of layered space-time processing was proposed by Foschini at Bell 
Laboratories [2]. D-BLAST uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the 
receiver. The encoder uses a space time arrangement that corresponds to a diagonal 
layering. Fig. 2-3 show the encoding procedure for D-BLAST. 
 
Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) 
The D-BLAST algorithm suffers from complicated implementation which is not 
suitable for practical situation. Therefore, a simplified version of the BLAST algorithm 
is known as V-BLAST [17]. In V-BLAST system, independently encoded data streams 
are transmitted from each transmit antenna simultaneously. The encoding procedure is 
shown in Fig. 2-4.

(1) Zero-Forcing (ZF) 
The ZF scheme is a kind of linear detection that means the received signal y is 
multiplied by a filter ZFG  
 ( ) 1 †,H H−= =ZFG H H H H  (2.21) 
where †H  is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of H. The output vector after the 
filter is as follows 
 † .=y H y  (2.22) 
The ZF can remove the spatial interferences from the received signal; however, the 
main drawback of ZF scheme is the resulting noise enhancement.

The received signal is given by

The main idea of SIC is to cancel the detected symbol from the received signal to 
improve primary ZF detection performance. The ZF filter is given in (2.21). The 
decision statistics of the ith symbol is obtained as 
 † ,i ix = H y  (2.25) 
where †iH  is the ith row of 
†H . Taking hard decision to ix , the estimation symbol 
is  can be obtained. After is  is detected, it is subtracted from the received signal to 
remove its influence, then updating the received signal as

at the Mth layer. Eq. (2.32) involves N-M+1 dimensions for detection. Eq. (2.32) is 
similar to a detection problem of a real-valued MISO system. First, we want to find 
the constellation points falling inside this slab. There are two algorithms that can help 
us find those constellation points, i.e., Plane Decoding Algorithm (PDA) [12] and 
Slab Decoding Algorithm (SLA) [14], [15]. 
Plane Decoding 
For a MISO system with k transmitted antennas where the inputs are independent 
symbols, the received signal can be written as 
 1 1 ,k ky h x h x η= + + +"  (2.33) 
where kx ∈ ] , nh  is the channel response and 2(0, )CNη σ∼  stands for AWGN.

the estimator means to find the point k∈x ]  which is the closest to the hyperplane 
P given as 
 1 1: .k kP h x h x y+ + ="  (2.35) 
First, define X, VX , PDX  as the sets of the points to be visited, the points that 
have been visited, and the points that are close to P in all dimensions, respectively. 
Then, initialize them with X= VX = 
( ){ }1x  where the (1) stands for the order of the 
vector in a set and j = 1. 
The main idea of the PDA is to find those candidates ( PDX ) which are close to 
P in all dimensions. The procedures of the PDA are summarized as follows: 
 20
z If j < k, update j = j + 1. Go to Step 1. 
z If j = k, the point ( )1x  is close to P in all dimensions and is stored in 
PDX . Next, discard 
( )1x  from the set X and reset j = 1. Go back to 
Step 1 to check a new point in X. 
Else, if ( )1j jx a≠ , then discard ( )1x  from the set X and reset j = 1. 
Go back to Step 1. 
Step 4:  If { } { }k ka a≠ Φ ∧ ≠ Φ   is not true, go to Step 5. Otherwise, we have 
two points ( )1=x x  except that j jx a=   and ( )1=x x  except that 
j jx a=   where x  and x  are close to P in dimension-j. Then, if 
( )1
j jx x= and then the point ( )1x  is close to P in dimension-1,2,…,j 
and do: 
z If j < k, update j = j + 1 and if VX∉x  then update { },X X= x  
and { },V VX X= x . Go to Step 1. 
z If j = k, the point ( )1x  is close to P in all dimensions and is stored in 
PDX . Next, discard 
( )1x  from the set X and reset j = 1. Go back to 
Step 1 to check a new point in X. 
If ( )1j jx x=  and then do: 
z If j < k, update j = j + 1 and if VX∉x  then update { },X X= x  
and { },V VX X= x . Go to Step 2. 
z If j = k, the point ( )1x  is close to P in all dimensions and is stored in 
PDX . Next, discard

The two algorithms can find all the lattice points satisfying (2.36) for a given C.

Chapter 3  
 
Proposed Geometry Based Decoding 
Algorithm with Intersection of 
Candidate Sets 
In Chapter2, we introduce the SSD which is a low complexity solution for 
underdetermined systems; however, the SSD has some disadvantages. First, because 
the two algorithms of SSD are independently and sequentially implemented, many 
constellation points are multiply checked. Second, in the PDA of SSD, in order to find 
the “ PDX ”, we perform many searches in the same dimension. As a result there are 
too many candidate points that fall inside the slab such that the SDA is executed too 
many times. For those reasons, its computational complexity is high. 
In this chapter, we introduce the proposed a low complexity search method for 
finding those points falling inside the slab and a low complexity decoding algorithm 
without the use of SDA. The details of the proposed algorithm will be introduced in 
Sections 3.1-3.2. The simulation results will be provided in Section 3.3 to show that 
the proposed algorithm performs better than the SSD.

outVX  and the points that have been visited, respectively. Then, initialize them 
with 
outVX = VDX =

vector in a set, j = 1, and 
out
[0, 0, , 0]VD = "  indicates that no dimension is visited in 
the beginning. 
The main idea of the algorithm is to find those point ( inX ) which fall into the 
slab (3.3). We design an algorithm to find the set inX  efficiently and the procedures 
of the search algorithm are summarized as follows. 
Step 1: If 
inVX  and outVX are empty, go to Step 5. 
Step 2:  If 
outVX  is empty, go to Step 4. Otherwise, we calculate

inVX∉x  then { }in in ,V VX X= x . 
And the value { }{ }1: max( ) , : min( )j ka a x d a x d∈ + − ∩  ]  where

the slab. 
z Update { }out out ,V VX X= x  and the jth element of outVD  
corresponding to each x . If j is the last visited dimension then 
discard ( )1x  from the set 
outVX . Go to Step 4. 
Step 6: Each point x  in inX  falls in the slab, which is shown in Fig. 3-1. 
 
The proposed search algorithm can efficiently find the valid candidate points 
satisfying (3.3) for a given C. Typical underdetermined decoders use all those points 
to find the near-ML solution by the SDA when the radius of constraints is not large. In 
the above description, we know the decoding complexity is closely related to the 
number of candidate points. However, the number of candidate points is still large 
with large antenna number difference. Therefore, an efficient decoder by conducting 
the intersectional operations with dynamic radius adaptation will be proposed in next 
section.

is to utilize all the available slab equations to find the candidate set, instead of only 
using Slab M. 
Assume that C is large enough to include the ML solution and the index satisfies 
i > j. Using Slabs i and j, we can find two candidate sets (i.e. ,i jx x  ) which include 
the ML solution. Therefore, the ML solution must fall inside the intersection of the 
two candidate sets (i.e. Gx ). This is illustrated in Fig. 3-3. After the slab intersection 
is performed, we will check the radius constraint of Slab i and j according to

In above Scenarios, we know that Scenario 1 has lower complexity than Scenario 2 
because the average number of candidate points of ix  is smaller than that of jx . By 
this reason, we expect that the number of candidate points can be as small as possible 
in the first candidate set just like Scenario 1. Therefore, we choose Slab M in (3.6) to 
find the first candidate set. Similarly, in order to have a lower complexity in the next 
procedure, we also expect that the number of points in the new candidate set can be as 
small as possible. By this reason, we choose Slab 1M −  to be next one to intersect 
with Slab M, and so on. The proposed decoding algorithm guarantees to find the ML 
solution after performing 1M −  times of the above efficient approach.

of the decoder, the radius starts [10], [15] with

3.3 Computer Simulation 
In this section, computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the 
symbol-error-rate (SER) and the decoding complexity. In order to compare the 
complexity of the proposed decoding algorithm with other decoding algorithms, we 
define the complexity weights of different operations according to [15]. The weight of 
additions and subtractions is one if real and two if complex. Each of The 
multiplications and divisions is counted one if the result is real and six if it is not real. 
The total complexity of each simulated algorithm is the sum of the number of times of 
each operation multiplied by its corresponding weight. The numerical results are 
measured and averaged over 1000 independent channels for various average 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, the calculation of complexity also includes 
all preprocessing procedures (e.g. QR decomposition). We set 0.99Φ =  and 
corresponding candidate point

3.4 Summary 
In this chapter, we give the detailed description of the proposed efficient search 
method which combines the PDA and SLA of SSD. The proposed search algorithm 
works more efficiently than the search algorithm of SSD (PDA+SLA), especially 
under a large constellation (i.e. 64-QAM) and a large number of antenna difference 
( t rN N− ), which is shown in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2, we propose a novel 
underdetermined decoding technique. The proposed decoder incorporating the 
proposed search method works more efficiently than SSD and obtains a near-ML 
performance. 
 40
4.1 Preprocessing 
In underdetermined MIMO systems, the channel matrix is preprocessed with 
some techniques, which can reduce the decoding complexity or improve the 
performance of the SDA. There are many preprocessing techniques such as lattice 
reduction [20-22], column permutation [22], and scaling [23]. However, we cannot 
apply these preprocessing techniques to reduce the decoding complexity in the 
proposed decoder in Chapter 3 over the underdetermined MIMO systems. In Section 
3.2, we know that the primary decoding complexity results from the intersection of 
candidate sets (3.7). Therefore, we want the procedure of intersection is executed as 
few times as possible. 
First, we define the number of candidate points ( pN ) inside the initial slab as an 
index of decoding complexity. Therefore, the pN  is expected to be as small as 
possible. We rewrite the initial slab form as 
 ' , , .M M M M M N NC r x r x C⎡ ⎤− ≤ − + + ≤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦y "  (4.1) 
The initial slab candidates can be found by channel columns reordering, and the 
number of the candidates is ( ), 1C N N M− + . Choosing the initial slab from the 
candidates is important for the proposed decoder. Geometrically speaking, 'My  
represents the distance from the origin to the slab, as shown in Fig. 4-1. In Fig. 4-1, 
we assume that the slab equation form is 1 1 2 2h x h x y+ = , where ih  is a constant 
and y is a variable, and we define 'My  as the location index of slab (ξ ). Fig. 4-1 
shows that pN  is small when ξ  is large. Therefore, we want to choose the slab 
from the candidates with the maximum ξ  to be the initial slab.

4.2 Alternative Approach of Preprocessing 
The preprocessing scheme in Section 4.1 is to perform an exhaustive search for 
all ξ . Therefore, the computational complexity is large when the number of  
candidates ( ( ), 1C N N M− + ) is large. In this section, we propose another approach 
of preprocessing to avoid the exhaustive search. We know that the size of channel 
matrix H is M N×  where M N< , so the rank of H is M. Span the columns of H 
as 
 
( ) ( )
( )

JK JK JK"
K K K" \
 (4.8) 
where S is a space spaned from the columns of H. The set of ivK  is a basis set of H. 
In this approach, the goal is to find the slab with a large ξ , but not the 
maximum one. In other words, we want the basis Mq
K  to have a high correlation to y 
from (4.2) and rewrite it as follows 
 ' ' ' ' '1 2 1 2 ,
T T MT T T
M My y y⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤= = = + ∈⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦y q y q y q y Rx n
K K K" " \  (4.9) 
where 1 2
M M
M
×⎡ ⎤= ∈⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q q q q
K K K" \  is a unitary matrix. Those column vectors 
in Q can be a basis set of H. In Section 4.1, the QR decomposition of H is performed 
by Householder process (Householder-QRD). In this section, we consider that the QR 
decomposition of H is performed by Gram-Schmidt process (GS-QRD). The detail of 
GS-QRD is summarized as follows. 
 
 
 
 46
 
Step 1:  Initialize the vector set { }, 1,2,...,iV i N= =hJK  and k = 1.  
Step 2:  Choose the lowest correlation between y and ih
JK
 from V and set it to 
be kq
K . 
Step 3:   Discard ih
JK
 from V and update V 
( )1     ,j j jj j i= − ⋅ ≠h h h q

  and k = k + 1. Go to Step 2. 
Step 4:   Compute 
,   1,2,..., 1.kjk jr j k= = −q h
JKK  
The QR decomposition of the reordering H is obtained. 
 
 
In Fig. 4-2 simulation, the 16-QAM is used, 3tN =  and 2rN =  under SNR 
= 15 dB. Denote the preprocessing by Householder in Section 3.1 as Method I and the 
preprocessing by GS-QRD as Method II. We investigate the probability density 
function of my  and make comparisons between the cases without preprocessing, 
Method I and Method II, as shown in Fig. 4-2. Fig. 4-2 shows that the value of my  
without preprocessing is the lowest. This means that the slab locates on the central of 
the constellation area, it implies that the mean of pN  without preprocessing is large 
than the pN  of Method I and Method II. Fig. 4-2 also shows that the probability 
density function of my  with Method II is almost same as Method I.

4.3 Computer Simulations 
In this section, computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance 
of SER and decoding complexity. The complexity weights of different operations are 
the same as in Section 3.3. The total complexity of each simulated algorithm is the 
sum of the number of times of each operation multiplied by its corresponding weight. 
The numerical results are measured and averaged over 1000 independent channels for 
various average SNRs. In addition, the calculation of complexity also includes all 
preprocessing procedures. We set 0.99Φ =  and 0.001Δ =  for radius C and use 
SE-SDA in SSD. The Method II preprocessing is used in the proposed decoder.

Conclusions and Future Works 
In the beginning, this report reviews some important MIMO techniques and 
typical decoding algorithms for MIMO systems. The GSD achieves the ML 
performance; however, its decoding complexity is exponentially increasing with the 
antenna number difference ( t rN N− ). Recently, the SSD is considered as an efficient 
decoding algorithm. However, there are two drawbacks of the SSD: search method of 
the SSD is not efficient and the number of valid candidate points is usually large. 
These lead to high decoding complexity. Hence, the goal of this report is aiming at the 
reduction of decoding complexity of the SSD without degrading its decoding 
performance. 
In Chapter 3, we propose another approach of search algorithms to find the valid 
candidate points in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2, an efficient decoding algorithm is 
proposed by conducting the intersectional operations with dynamic radius adaptation. 
With a large constellation size, the decoding complexity of the proposed decoding 
algorithm is significantly lower than that of the SSD. Simulations demonstrate that the 
proposed decoding algorithm has a lower decoding complexity than the SSD, and 
achieves a near-ML performance.

A scheme based on QR decomposition (QRD) is proposed 
to perform MIMO precoding in limited feedback MIMO 
systems. The proposed scheme is illustrated in A) QR 
detection, B) QR-based MIMO precoding and C) low 
complexity QR-based selection criterion as follows.

Eq. (10) shows that the minimum absolute value of the 
diagonal entries of R in the QRD of HFM dominates the error 
probability of QR detection for a high SNR. By taking the 
minima of both sides of (10), we have 
|)|min()(|)|min( ,1,1 iiMiMeiiMi rQMPrQ ≤≤≤≤ ⋅≤≤ ρρ F .    (11) 
In (11), the block symbol error rate can achieve its minimum 
by selecting an optimal precoder operating on the effective 
channel when the diagonal entries of R are nearly equal. Thus, 
to minimize the probability of error in the QR detection, we 
propose a low-complexity QR selection criterion using the 
maximum of the minimum diagonal entries of upper 
triangular matrix of QR-decomposition on MIMO channel to 
select the optimal precoder from the codebook in the MIMO 
precoding system:

Note that (12) is used to select the precoder that maximizes 
the minimum absolute value of diagonal entries of R in Mth 
mode codebook. By conducting an exhaustive search in the 
optimization of (12), the proposed QR-based selection 
criterion minimizes the probability of block error in (8). 
Finally, the receiver sends the index of the selected precoder 
in the codebook to the transmitter via the limited feedback 
channel.  
C. low complexity QR-based selection criterion 
When the codebook size is large in (2), it becomes 
computationally intensive to perform an exhaustive search in 
finding the optimum precoder. To remedy this, a simple low-
complexity QR-based selection criterion is proposed.  
For M < Mt, the projection 2-norm distance between two 
matrices is defined as follows [3]:

B. Effect of number of feedback bits 
To address the effect of number of feedback bits in the 
proposed QR detection scheme, we consider the case with M 
= 1, 2, and W = 4 bits/symbol, with κ = 0 and κ = 10 in Fig. 
3(a) and Fig. 3(b), respectively. For each case, the number of 
feedback bits can be B = 2, 4, 6, 7 and ∞. When B is finite, 
the reduced search set size PM in (14) is given as 1, 4, 16 and 
32. As expected, the detection performance of the proposed 
QR selection criterion by using (12)-(14) improves with the 
number of feedback bits. The improvement is due to that a 
larger codebook is available for more selection diversity to 
ease the ill-condition effect.

C. Computational complexity  
Finally, we compare the complexity of the proposed QR-
based selection and SVD-based selection criteria working 
with the QR detector and MMSE detector, respectively. The 
same simulation setting as in Fig. 3 are adopted. The resulting 
flop counts obtained with Mt = Mr = 4, M = 2, B = {2, 4, 6}, 
NM = 4PM =  2B and W = 4 are shown in Table II. As observed, 
the proposed QR-based selection criterion can reduce the 
computational complexity by about 95% over the SV-based 
selection criterion when B = 6. This reduction in complexity 
confirms the results depicted previously in Table I.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, a QR-based selection criterion is proposed for 
MIMO precoding with a limited feedback channel. The 
proposed precoder exhibits similar performance to the 
conventional SVD-based precoder, but requires a much lower 
complexity. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed 
precoder can work with a small number of feedback bits, 
while achieving the performance of the ideal precoder. The 
proposed precoder can be employed in next generation mobile 
communications systems, such as 3GPP LTE and IEEE 
802.16m, for efficient MIMO precoder selection at the mobile 
station.
