Abstract 
    This project investigates residual stresses of sputtered aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films. 
Various interlayers to improve the electro-optical and mechanical properties of AZO thin films are also 
studied. Three metal interlayers with various thicknesses are sputtered on the glass substrate, and then AZO 
thin films are sputtered on the top of the interlayers. The effects of the interlayers on the resistance and 
transmittance of the AZO thin films are discussed. The result shows that the metal interlayers effectively 
improve the electric resistance but reduce the optical transmittance of the AZO thin films. Moreover, 
mechanical tests indicate all the interlayers will slightly decrease the hardness and modulus, but only the 
aluminum interlayer decreases the residual stress. All the results are compared to those of the AZO thin film 
without any interlayer, showing that the best interlayer is the 6 nm thick aluminum film. 
 
Keywords: AZO thin film; Residual stresses; Interlayer; Mechanical property; Electro-optical property. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
    Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) thin films have been widely used as electrodes for various 
optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and displays.1 The most commonly used TCO film is indium tin 
oxide (ITO) because of its high optical transmittance and low electrical resistivity.2 However, due to the high 
cost and toxicity of the ITO film, the aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film becomes a potential 
alternative.3-8 
    Although the AZO thin film possesses the low cost advantage, its electrical and optical properties are 
normally worse than the ITO film.1,2 Therefore, how to deposit a high quality AZO film becomes an important

was utilized in the microstructure analysis. The phase structure and crystallite grain size can be determined 
from the XRD in the usual 2θ geometry. According to the Scherrer formula,11,12 the grain size D is defined as

with the correction factor k (=1.05), the x-ray wavelength λ (=0.154 nm), the diffraction angle θ, the full 
width at the half maximum (FWHM) B, and the broadening peak width B0. 
A surface profiler (Kosaka ET4000) is used to measure the residual stress of thin films based on the 
substrate curvature method. In this method, the residual stresses are determined by measuring the change of 
substrate curvature induced by the deposited thin film. Thus, the specimen’s surface becomes concave when 
the thin film is under a tensile stress, whereas the surface becomes convex under a compressive stress. By 
using Stoney’s formula, the internal stress in deposited thin films can be determined by13-15

where fσ  is the internal stress in the thin film, sE  and sν  are the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of 
the substrate. ft  and st  indicate the film and substrate thicknesses. R  is the radius of curvature of the 
specimen after deposition, and 0R  stands for the radius of curvature before deposition. 
    Typical nanoindentation experiments were performed by using a Hysitron Triboindenter fitted with a 
standard Berkovich indenter. The loading time, holding time, and unloading time of the indentation tests were 
all 5 sec. The peak load was carefully controlled so that the indentation depth was always less than 20% of the 
film thickness for each specimen. A standard analysis to determine the hardness and elastic modulus from the 
unloading load-depth curve was conducted according to the Oliver and Pharr method.16 The hardness H  can 
be defined as 
    maxPH

where maxP  represents the peak load and A  is the projected contact area. The hardness is the mean pressure 
that a material can support under load. The relation between the load ( P ) and the depth ( h ) can be 
represented as16 
    ( )mfP h hα= −       (4) 
where α  is an indent constant, m  depends on the geometry of the indenter, and fh  indicates the final 
depth. The elastic modulus of the indented sample can be inferred from the initial unloading contact stiffness, 
S dp / dh= , i.e., the slope of the initial portion of the unloading curve. Based on the indentation analysis 
developed by Snedden,17 the relation between the contact stiffness, contact area, and elastic modulus can be 
derived as

    Fig. 5 shows the residual stress of AZO thin films with various interlayer thicknesses. Based on the 
Stoney’s formula shown in Eq. (2), the residual stress of the thin film can be determined from the substrate 
curvature change between before and after the thin film deposition. Fig. 5 shows all the residual stresses for 
all cases are compressive, and vary from -200 MPa to -140 MPa. It shows the average residual stresses of 
AZO/Ag/Glass are -177, -167, and -176 MPa for 6, 8, and 10 nm silver interlayers. The average residual 
stresses of AZO/Al/Glass decreases from -143 to -162 MPa as the aluminum interlayer thickness increases 
from 6 to 10 nm. The average values of AZO/Cu/Glass are -181, -140, and -171 MPa for 6, 8, and 10 nm 
copper interlayers. Note that the residual stress of the AZO thin film without any interlayer (AZO/Glass), is 
-173 MPa, meaning that only the aluminum interlayer can reduce the amplitude of the residual stress of the 
AZO films. 
    The substrate curvature method is the most commonly used technique in thin film stress measurement. 
The other non-destructive technique have been frequently used for residual stress measurement is X-ray 
diffraction (XRD). The basic concept of the XRD analysis is that the lattice spacing varies with the orientation 
of the lattice planes with respect to the loading direction. The film stress can be determined from the linear 
regression of the XRD peak shift. However, the accuracy of the XRD method strongly depends on the 
crystallinity of the thin film. In this work, therefore, we use substrate curvature method instead of the XRD 
method because it is difficult to identify enough XRD peaks of the AZO films (see Fig. 1~3).

    The elastic modulus and hardness of various AZO thin films measured by nanoindentation are shown in 
Figs. 6 and 7. They show that, as the interlayer thickness increases, the moduli and hardnesses of AZO with 
silver and copper interlayers (AZO/Ag/Glass and AZO/Cu/Glass) increase but those of AZO with aluminum 
 10
increases from 6 to 10 nm. For AZO/Al/Glass, the resistance almost remains constant. The sheet resistance 
decreases from 170 to 140 Ω/  as the copper interlayer thickness increases from 6 to 10 nm. Referring to the 
result without the interlayer listed in Table 3, it indicates the sheet resistance of AZO/Glass is 4500 Ω/ , 
which is much higher than those with the interlayer. The result emphasizes that the interlayer effectively 
improves the electric resistance of the AZO thin films.

    Fig. 9 exhibits the optical transmittance spectra of AZO thin films with various silver interlayer 
thicknesses. It shows the transmittance decreases as the interlayer thickness increases. With 6 nm silver 
interlayer, the average transmittance is 54.79%. And then, the average transmittance decreases to 40.46% as 
the silver interlayer increases to 10 nm. Fig. 10 exhibits the transmittance spectra of AZO thin films with 
various aluminum interlayer thicknesses. Similarly, the transmittance decreases as the interlayer thickness 
increases. The average transmittance is 83.54% with 6 nm aluminum interlayer, and it decreases to 66.21% as 
the aluminum interlayer increases to 10 nm. Note that the average transmittance of the AZO thin film without 
any interlayer is 87.18%. Fig. 11 exhibits the AZO transmittance with various copper interlayer thicknesses, 
showing the average transmittance decreases from 72.40% to 68.20% as the copper interlayer thickness 
increases from 6 nm to 10 nm. Comparing Figs. 9~11, the transmittance of the AZO films decreases as adding 
an interlayer, silver interlayer especially. However, the average value of the AZO film with 6 nm aluminum 
interlayer decreases slightly and still maintains an acceptable 83.54% transmittance.
