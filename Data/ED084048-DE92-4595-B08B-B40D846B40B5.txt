一、研究背景與目的 
台灣的 New RC 設計，如果要全
盤改用日本 AIJ 方法設計，有其困難。
主要差異來自耐震設計地震力基準差
異甚大，且基本上我國的規範是源自
美國 ACI 318 規範[1]，若我國想使用
New RC 設計興建超高層建築，必須重
新評估我國現行規範中之設計公式。 
這兩年來台灣混凝土學會(Taiwan 
Concrete Institute, TCI) 參考日本與歐
美各國現有已發展之規格，並顧及方
便爾後之材料制訂、實際推展與國內
常用鋼筋強度規格之差距等因素，推
薦 SD685 與 SD785 作為下一個世代的
鋼筋規格。其中 SD 685 鋼筋適用於耐
震構材和結構牆之軸向主鋼筋，而 SD 
785 鋼筋則適用於剪力筋或圍束鋼筋
用途[2]。 
經過兩年的研發，國內鋼鐵廠已
經具有生產 SD685 與 SD785 新型高強
度鋼筋之實力，刻正研發鋼筋機械式
續接及錨定新技術，配合既有之預鑄
工法及隔減震新工法，我國已經具備
升級鋼筋混凝土構造的條件。但由於
我國與日本耐震設計地震力基準不
同，梁柱構架韌性需求大於日本規範
(設計地震力較日本小)，加上 ACI 318
規範所使用的設計公式，在梁柱接頭
部分與日本 AIJ 設計指針存有歧異，
故本研究執行梁柱接頭測試資料庫調
查與差異分析，並補充 4 組測試數據
展現新高強度 RC 梁柱接頭之耐震性
能，研修新高強度鋼筋混凝土梁柱接
頭設計建議。 
 
二、研究方法 
本研究第一階段測試 4 組梁柱接
頭試體，十字形內部接頭和 T 字形外

及圖 3 所示，梁反曲點距離為 6 m，柱
反曲點距離為 3.2 m；材料性質如表 2
及表 3 所示。試體梁柱構件之配筋細
部相近，惟材料等級不同，旨在驗證
以 ACI 方法設計之新高強度鋼筋梁柱
接頭是否具有適當之耐震性能。試體
大致上依照現行 ACI 318 規範方法設
計(但解除材料強度 cf  上限)，試體
X100 及 T100 之測試結果如圖 4 至圖
11 所示。 
試驗在 NCREE 執行，加載系統使
用三具致動器取目標位移控制，梁端
致動器施加反復載重模擬梁柱結構的
層間變位（Story Drift），水平致動器抓
住柱頂不動，模擬半層反曲點，測試
加載程序由層間變位 0.25%依次增加
到 6%為止，每一層間變位執行 3 個迴
圈，測試方法大致參照 ACI 374.1-05[3]
報告之抗彎構架性能測試要求。 
 
三、測試結果與資料庫比對 
(1) 測試結果顯示，使用高強度鋼筋SD 
685 按 ACI 318 規範設計，仍可達到
ACI 374 耐震性能要求(最大考量地震
3.5%層間變位以上，強度損失不超過
1/4，相對消能比不小於 1/8，殘餘割線

minimum clear spacing between bars of 4 db. In typical heavily reinforced concrete structures, however, the 4db 
clear spacing is not very practical. Lee and Yu (2009) tested exterior beam-column joints with closely-spaced 
headed bars and showed that the anchorage capacity of headed bars were underestimated using the available 
model proposed by Thompson et al. (2006b). Their beam-column joint test results showed that the minimum 
clear spacing of 4db between headed bars could be further reduced for longitudinal beam bars terminates within 
a continuous column.

Figure 1.  Typical CCT node specimen test for headed bars (Thompson et al. 2005) 
 
There is limited published guidance information on the anchorage of headed bars, especially with the use of 
high-strength materials. Japanese studies show great advantages are accomplished by the used of high-strength 
concrete and high-strength reinforcement in design. The use of high-strength materials in large reinforced 
concrete structure, such as high-rise building in Japan, accounts for significant reduction in the amount of 
reinforcement, structural member size, labor, cost, and construction period. 
 
An experimental program is supported by TCI to study the anchorage capacity of multiple high-strength headed 
bars within high-strength concrete. This experimental program investigated the anchorage capacity of headed 
bars with a clear spacing of 2db between bars, which is a more practical spacing in heavily reinforced concrete 
structures. In general this study is aim to liberate the limitation of materials strengths and clear spacing between 
bars given in current building code. 
 
 
EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM 
 
CCT node tests 
 
Seventeen units were constructed, with separate test performed on each ends, making a total of 34 tested CCT 
node specimens. Typical test setup is shown in Figure 2, which is quite similar to Figure 1 from Thompson et al. 
(2005). Each specimen was marked with 4-in. grid lines within there tested ends. These lines were used as 
coordinates to check crack patterns developed within the node. The bearing plates at the bottom and top were 4db 
and 6db, respectively, similar to those of Thompson et al. (2005), make testing results more comparative.

Material properties 
 
This experimental program used USD685 screw-deformed bars and associated mechanical anchorage devices  
supplied by Tokyo Tekko in Japan. The head had a diameter of 65-mm or 80-mm for No.8 (D25) or No.10 (D32) 
bars, respectively. Typical stress-strain relationships of used reinforcing bars are shown in Figure 4. The 
specified yield strength for USD685 reinforcement is 685 MPa or 100 ksi. The ratio of ultimate-to-yield strength 
ratio is about 1.29 for used USD685 reinforcing bars.

Non-shrinkage mortar was used to bond and fastened the mechanical head onto the screw-deformed bars, as 
shown in Figure 5. The grouting mortar compressive strengths was 70 MPa (10 ksi) at one-day age and 84 MPa 
at 7-day age. High-strength concrete with a compressive strength between 6000 psi (41 MPa) and 8000 psi (55 
MPa) were used. A special steel mold was designed to cast four units of different size within one batch. Figure 5 
shows the casting operation for a given batch. 
 
   
Figure 5. Grouting mortar into heads, casting concrete into the steel mold, and finishing 
 
Standard concrete cylinders were prepared during casting and cured with the same moisture condition as CCT 
node specimens. Average compressive strengths of three cylinders were measured at 7, 14, 28 and 56 days, 
which covered all CCT node testing ages. Finally, the concrete compressive strength for CCT node testing age 
was determined using linear interpolation. 
 
Specimen Identification 
 
Each specimen was identified with sets of numbers and symbols that were directly related to variables within 
that unit. For example, Specimen 2-#8C-6k had two No. 8 tension bars and confined concrete with a cylinder 
strength of 6 ksi. Similarly, Specimen 3-#10U-8k had three No. 10 tension bars and un-confined concrete with a 
cylinder strength of 8 ksi. Also, Specimen 1-#8C-8k had one No. 8 tension bars and confined concrete with a 
cylinder strength of 6 ksi.  
 
All CCT node specimens were tested using a strut angle of 45º, with circular heads, except for one unit which 
was of straight length, non-headed (N.H). Notably, the clear spacing between bars is 2db for the end with three 
tension bars, while it is 5db for the other end with two tension bars (Figure 3).  
 
 
- 244 -
The same comparison can be observed with Specimens 3-#8C-7k and 2-#10C-7k, as shown in Figure 7. 
Comparing specimens with different clear spacing showed that the specimen with 2db spacing failed at a higher 
load as compared to the specimen with 5db spacing as set out in the code. This was despite the fact that the 
specimen with 5db spacing did had a larger bar area of 2.46 in.2. It seems clearly that a clear spacing of 2db is 
acceptable. 
 
 
   
(a) Specimen 3-#8C-7k, tension bar area = 2.37 in.2, peak load = 326 kips 
 
  
(a) Specimen 2-#10C-7k, tension bar area = 2.46 in.2, peak load = 123 kips 
Figure 7. Comparison of Specimens with equivalent bar area but different clear spacing 
 
These observations can be found from 8 of 12 confined specimens with a clear spacing of 2db or 5db(Table 1). 
However, for the other 4 of 12 confined specimens, one (Specimen 2-#10C-8k) experienced an unexpected high 
load at failure, while another Specimen 2-#8C-8k failed at a low load as a result of a mechanical head which was 
mistakenly not grouted during the grouting process. During testing, Specimen 2-#8C-8k failed a load of 156 kips, 
which was below the yield loads. The failure was more of a pullout type, similar to that of non-headed bars, 
failing from the vertical crack beneath top plate. This observation was important in realizing the amount of 
anchorage capacity that can be lost as a result mechanicals heads not properly bonded or anchored to it 
reinforcing bars. 
 
From those observations it seems that three No. 8 headed bars, with minimum clear spacing between bars of 2db, 
can effectively replaced two No.10 headed bars of 5db clear spacing without affecting its anchorage capacity. As 
a result, smaller clear spacing between bars of 2db did not have a detrimental effect on anchorage behavior with 
this experimental investigation. 
 
Effect of bar size  
 
Comparing the effect of bar shows that specimens with larger No.10 diameter bar would generally fail at higher 
loads when parameters are same within the specimen. This is expected as it was a larger bar areas. Specimens 
fabricated with three No.10 tension bars would generally fail after high loads by crushing the strut region. It was 
the opposite for related specimen consisting of two No. 10 tension bars, which would experience yielding of the 
tension bars. 
- 246 -
 
CONCLUDSIONS 
 
Bars size of No.8 and N0. 10 were used within this study with mechanical heads of 65 mm or 80 mm, 
respectively. Both bars had net bearing area greater than 4 times bar area, as set out by the ACI code. Head 
bearing was sufficient for bar anchorage at the CCT node for most confined specimens. The overall anchorage 
behavior within the CCT node proved to be as effective with high-strength reinforced bars and high-strength 
concrete. Confinement in the form of stirrups was more effective in specimens with multiple tension bars as 
compared to specimens of single tension bars, improving the overall capacity of the specimen. A practical 
minimum clear spacing of 2db between bars was able to sustain anchorage capacity effectively within the tested 
CCT node, this however, was more limited to confined specimens. The overall picture of this study shows that 
mechanical anchorage using headed bars closely-spaced high-strength headed bars within high-strength concrete 
was effective achieving the necessary anchorage capacity. Future studies on the anchorage behavior of headed 
bars are recommended with higher strength of concrete, different types of mechanical heads and multiple layers 
of tension bars.
