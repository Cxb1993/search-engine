研究方法
The compression technology supported by MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group)
is widely used in various current multimedia applications, for example, network
multimedia streamings, online music stores, digital televisions, and portable devices.
In the MPEG-1 standard, the compression of an audio signal can be categorized
to three layers, MPG Layer 1, MPEG Layer 2, and MPEG Layer 3. These layers are
The Balsa back-end can be used to generate gate level netlists for supported
CAD systems [1] [2]. In this research, we described some basic cells for the Xilinx
FPGA generated by Balsa and some handshake components in the Balsa synthesis
system.
The frame structure of a MP3 file contains 5 parts, Header, CRC, Side
information, Main data, Ancillary. This process flow of the MP3 operates in the
sequence as the normal structure. It can be divided into three main parts: the bitstream
decoding, the inverse quantization and the frequency-to-time mapping. We introduced
the concepts of asynchronous pipeline. Finally we illustrated the Balsa back-end.
Balsa synthesis system is composed of about 40 components, which can be translated
into gate-level netlists.
結果與討論
In the Balsa simulation, all kinds of the channel modes and the block types have
been simulated using the verification method. Because the simulation in the Balsa
system costs much time, the specified characteristic test files are simulated first such
as short block, long block, mixed block, single channel and dual channel. Then, we
used some MP3 music with fewer frames to confirm the entire PAMP3 correctness.
Finally, a MP3 music with more than 1000 frames is used to simulate the performance
of the PAMP3.
In this research, we designed a pipelined architecture in the asynchronous
MP3 decoder in Balsa, which is an asynchronous design language and synthesis tool.
We used an OfMP3 decoder to verify the output of each stage of the PAMP3. And the
final outputs of the PAMP3 can be played by the audio software. All functions can be
executed correctly except the Joint-Stereo channel mode. We used the Synopsys
Design Compiler with TSMC 0.13μm process and the Xilinx ISE to synthesis our
design. There are timing issues in the Xilinx back-end with certain combinations of
handshake components. The Advanced Processor Technologies Group will address
these problems and fix them in the future release.
We implemented a MP3 decoder model with Balsa in ways of an asynchronous
circuit design. Although the area cost is a little large, the design flow of using CAD
tools to design an asynchronous circuit is confirmed.
