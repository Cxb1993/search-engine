21. Introduction
Human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occurs through inhalation,
ingestion and dermal absorption. Inhalation is the predominant exposure route (Lippmann,
1992). Laborers who use organic solvents typically use personal breathing protective
equipment to mitigate VOC inhalation. However, human skin exposure to gaseous VOC
emission has been neglected. Previous research results on the mass transfer and absorption of
VOCs for secreting liquors and human have focused on blood, urine and muscle (Lippmann,
1992; Sinclair, et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2003). VOC equilibrium partition between air and
sweat phases has rarely been studied.
Human dermal exposure to VOCs is initiated by absorption through sweat on the skin’s
surface. Table 1 presents the compositions of human sweat. Sweat is 99% water and under 1%
salts. Most inorganic salts are ionic salts of sodium, potassium, chloride, ammonia (NH4+),
and most organic salts are lactate (10-133 mM) and urea (6.2-12.1 mM). The pH values of
human sweat range from 4-7, depending on health and amount of activity (Mountcastle, 1974;
Fellmann et al., 1983; Lamont, 1987; Pilardeau et al., 1988; Colbert, 1993).
The VOC concentration at the interface between air and water is typically specified by
an equilibrium partitioning coefficient (pc).

where Cg* denotes the gaseous VOC concentration (mg m-3) in equilibrium with the aqueous
phase at a constant water temperature (Tw), and CL is an aqueous VOC concentration (mg m-3
or 103 mg L-1). Many researchers have demonstrated that salt concentration affect the pc
values of VOC. The pc value of methanol increases as much as ten times in aqueous sodium
salt solutions (Zhu et al., 2000). 0.2 M potassium chloride yields a 10% increase in the pc of
chlorinated hydrocarbons, including tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene,
1,1,1-trichloroethane, chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane and dichloromethane (Gossett, 1987).
The effect of salts and the exact concentrations of salts to increase pc values require further
studies, despite the general finding of Alaee et al. (1996) that the reduced aqueous solubility,
especially of aromatic hydrocarbons, is related to the appearance of salts. The practical pc
value data of VOC is important in evaluating the VOC-dose absorbed through sweat-skin
exposure.
Cheng et al. (2004) thoroughly evaluated how various aqueous VOC concentrations (CL)
influences pc. The pc values of alcohols (ethanol, iso-propanol (IPA) and iso-butanol of CL =
12-125 mg L-1) and of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK of CL = 10-85 mg L-1) at Tw = 300-315 K,
were studied and compared to the results for pc of toluene. Those authors concluded that the
effect of CL on the pc value of alcohols and MEK is stronger than that on toluene. For instance,
at 300 K, pc of ethanol varies from 0.0007215 to 0.0002971 as CL varies from 12 to 125 mg

Dawson (1985) showed that ΔHtr (kJ mol-1) = (enthalpy of solution at infinite dilution) –
(enthalpy of vaporization of pure organic liquid). Integrating Eq. 4 with pc and Tw enables
trH over a range of temperatures to be determined from pc measured at Tw1 and Tw2:

2.3 Testing effects of salt on the pc values of VOCs
Two high-concentration salts in human sweat, sodium chloride and sodium lactate, were
injected into aqueous VOC solutions in proportions 0, 0.05, 0.25 and 1% to undergo the SET
procedures. Also, two low-concentration salts, urea and ammonia, were injected at
percentages of 0, 0.025, 0.1 and 0.5%.
A one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) test for the variance of pc with salt content was
conducted following the procedures in“Fundamental Concepts in the Design of Experiments” 
by Hicks (1993), to quantify the effects of salt content (sodium chloride, sodium lactate, urea
and ammonia) on pc. A mixed-composition of salts (Table 1) was used as artificial sweat
injected into the aqueous VOC to perform SET procedures to elucidate the overall effect of
multiple salts on pc. Notably, the pH of the artificial sweat was around 6, which falls within
Colbert’srange of 4-7 (1993).
2.4 Analysis and chemicals
A GC-FID (Agilent 6890N, USA) with a capillary column of HP19091Z-413 HP-1
Methyl Siloxane (30 m x 320 µm x 0.25 µm) was used to measure gaseous VOC
concentrations. The oven and detection conditions were set as follows. The oven had an initial
temperature of 323 K and a final temperature of 373 K. The time required to reach 373 K was
5 min. The detector was heated to 523 K. The gas flow rates were 40 mL min-1 for H2, 450
mL min-1 for air and 45 mL min-1 for N2. The water bath equipment used to determine the Cg*
of VOC was locally manufactured with a controllable temperature range of 278-353 K (± 0.05
K). All Cg* measurements were made at Tw = 300, 305 and 310 K. Gaseous VOC samples
were collected and liquid VOCs were prepared with 1.0 mL and 1.0 µL syringes (Hamilton,
USA), respectively. All chemicals were of analytic reagent grade. Both VOCs, IPA and MEK,
were manufactured by J. T. Baker. The four salts, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, urea and
6sodium lactate concentration from 0.05 to 1% simultaneously increases the pc values of IPA
and MEK. However, urea and ammonia (0.025-0.5%) are not associated with a variation in
the pc values of IPA and MEK.
Table 3 presents the pc values of IPA with CL = 12.01±0.09 mg L-1 dissolved with four
salts at 300 K. Table 4(a) shows the results obtained in the one-way ANOVA test of the eight
pc data with 1% freedom (F0.95): the pc matrix comprises pc data concerning the additions of
two sodium salts. The cumulative F distribution with three and four degrees of freedom (F3, 4)
was 4.21 ≈ 6.59 (F0.95), which was close to the 5% significance level. The effect of salt on
both sodium chloride and sodium lactate is significant for IPA equilibrium partitioning at the
air-water interface. Another ANOVA test of pc reveals that when urea and ammonia are added
(Table 4(b)), the F3, 4 value is 0.10, much lower than 6.59 (F0.95). The analytical results
indicate that pc depends on the presence of sodium salts, but not urea or ammonia. Water in
equilibrium with a higher gaseous VOC concentration desorbed more hydrophilic VOC.
However, experimental data show that water dissolved with more sodium salt desorbed less
hydrophilic VOC. In fact, both the effects of concentration and salt associated with high
concentrations of gaseous VOC dissolved in human sweat oppose each other. The comparison
of pc of IPA and MEK for effects of VOC liquid concentration and salt is summarized in Table
5.
3.3 Values of pc of VOC at the air-sweat interface
Four salts (sodium chloride, sodium lactate, urea and ammonia) with dissolved in water
in specific proportions were prepared as artificial human sweat to identify the pc values
associated with various CL and Tw using the SET procedure to evaluate thoroughly the
multiple effects of concentration and salt on the pc of VOCs. Table 1 presents the simulated
composition of sweat.
Table 6 summarizes the pc values of IPA (12 and 120 mg L-1) and MEK (10 and 80 mg
L-1) for the air-sweat phases at 300-310 K. The trH values of IPA and MEK in a
temperature range of 305-310 K, based on 300 K, are also determined using Eq. (5). For both
water and artificial sweat, the concentration effect on pc and trH values of IPA and MEK is
dominant. The pc values of VOC at high CL concentrations are also less than those at low CL,
even though the pc values at the air-sweat interface increase slightly more than those at the
air-water interface. Typically, the pc values of IPA in artificial sweat drop by as much as
32.5% (0.000288/0.000886 exactly) as the CL varies from 12 to 120 mg L-1 at 300 K, and
those of MEK drop by as much as 70.9% (0.00151/0.00213 exactly) as the CL varies from 10
to 80 mg L-1 at 300 K. The trH values of IPA and MEK follow the same trends as pc. For
