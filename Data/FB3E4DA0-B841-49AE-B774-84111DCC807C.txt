二、緣由與目的 
多孔介質內之自然對流熱傳遞與質量
傳遞現象相當重要，可用於地球物理學、
地熱系統、回收油技術、絕熱工程、填充
床觸媒反應器、蓄熱床與穀物儲存設備
等。然而有關多孔介質內非牛頓流體自然
對流之研究較少[1-4]。Chen 與 Chen [1] 
研究有均勻壁溫之多孔介質內非牛頓流體
水平圓柱與球表面附近之自然對流熱傳
遞。Nakayama 與 Koyama [2] 研究有非均
勻壁溫之多孔介質內非牛頓流體任意形狀
附近之自然對流熱傳遞。 Rastogi 與 
Poulikakos [3] 研究有均勻壁溫與壁濃度

質內非牛頓流體長方形空間內之自然對流
熱傳遞與質量傳遞。 
改變表面形狀或增加不規則曲面裝置
乃是相當受人重視的一主題，此種應用在
熱傳設備上，如散熱片組為增加熱傳面積
將表面設計成凹凸狀、熱交換器之圓管、
以及動力廠及冷凍空調設備中之蒸發器及
凝結器等設備，較大型之應用，如儲存穀
物之容器與空心牆絕熱系統。有關波形板
自然對流之研究，主要集中研究在垂直波
形板表面之邊界層自然對流熱傳遞現象 
[5-9]. 其中，Yao [5] 研究有均勻壁溫牛
頓流體內垂直波形板表面附近之邊界層自
然對流熱傳遞。Rees 和 Pop [6] 研究有均

牛頓型冪次律流體之自然對流熱傳遞與質

Abstract: - This work uses a thermal non-equilibrium model to study the natural convection heat transfer near a 
horizontal cylinder of elliptic cross section with constant wall temperature in a fluid-saturated porous medium. 
A coordinate transformation is used to obtain the nonsimilar governing boundary layer equations. The 
transformed governing equations are then solved by the cubic spline collocation method. Results for the local 
Nusselt numbers are presented as functions of the porosity scaled thermal conductivity ratio, the heat transfer 
coefficient between the solid and fluid phases, and the aspect ratio when the major axis of the elliptical cylinder 
is vertical (slender orientation) and horizontal (blunt orientation). An increase in the porosity scaled thermal 
conductivity ratio or the heat transfer coefficient between the solid and fluid phases tends to increase the heat 
transfer rates. Moreover, the heat transfer rates of the elliptical cylinder with slender orientation are higher than 
those with blunt orientation.

1   Introduction 
Heat and mass transfer driven by thermal and solutal 
buoyancy forces in a fluid-saturated porous medium 
is of great importance in geophysical, geothermal and 
industrial applications, such as the extraction of 
geothermal energy and the migration of moisture 
through air contained in fibrous insulations.  
Merkin [1] presented the similarity solutions for 
natural convection heat transfer on a horizontal 
cylinder in a saturated porous medium. Pop et al. [2] 
examined the problem of natural convection heat 
transfer about cylinders of elliptic cross section in a 
porous medium. Yih [3] studied the heat and mass 
transfer from a permeable horizontal cylinder in a 
fluid-saturated porous medium. Kumari and Jayanthi 
[4] studied the non-Darcy non-Newtonian natural 
convection flow over a horizontal cylinder in a 
porous medium. Cheng [5] studied the heat and mass 
transfer from a permeable horizontal cylinder of 
elliptic cross section in a fluid-saturated porous 
medium.  
The thermal non-equilibrium model is used to 
account for the temperature difference between solid 
and fluid phases within the representative control 
volume in porous media. Rees and Pop [6] studied 
the vertical natural convection boundary-layer flow 
in a porous medium using a thermal non-equilibrium 
model. Mohamad [7] studied the natural convection 
in a differentially heated cavity filled with a saturated 
porous matrix. Baytas and Pop [8] used a thermal 
non-equilibrium model to study the natural 
convection flow in a square porous cavity. Saeid [9] 
used a thermal non-equilibrium model to study the 
natural convection near a horizontal cylinder in a 
porous medium.   
This work applies the coordinate transformation 
and the cubic spline collocation method to analyze 
the heat transfer by natural convection along a 
horizontal elliptical cylinder in fluid saturated porous 
media with constant wall temperature using a thermal 
non-equilibrium model. The influence of the thermal 
conductivity ratio parameter, the heat transfer 
coefficient parameter, and the aspect ratio on the heat 
transfer characteristics near a horizontal elliptical 
cylinder in a fluid-saturated porous medium is 
examined in both cases when the major axis is 
horizontal (blunt orientation) and vertical (slender 
orientation).

3   Problem Solution 
The governing differential equations, Eqs. (14) and 
(15), and the boundary conditions, Eqs. (16) and (17), 
can be solved by the cubic spline collocation method 
[11, 12]. The Simpson’s rule for variable grids is used 
to calculate the value of f at every position from Eq. 
(13) and the boundary conditions, Eqs. (16) and (17). 
Variable grids with 200 grid points are used in the η  
direction. The minimum step size is 0.01. The value 
of the edge of the boundary ayer ∞η  is about 12. 
Moreover, a grid with 150 grid points is used in the 
ξ  direction. At every grid point, the iteration process 
continues until the convergence criterion for all the

Note that ϑ  refers to fθ  and sθ , and the quantity

The quantities F, G, and S are known coefficients 
evaluated at previous time steps (Table 1).   By using 
the cubic spline relations [11, 12], Eq. (28) may be 
written in the following tridiagonal form as

Here Eq. (29) can be easily solved by using the

In order to check the accuracy of the present 
method, the local Nusselt number 5.0/ RaNu  for 
1=ab  obtained in the current study under Darcian 
assumptions for a horizontal circular cylinder are 
compared with the solutions reported by Merkin [1] 
and Yih [3] by using the thermal-equilibrium model. 
As shown in Table 2, the present results are found to 
be in excellent agreement with the results of Merkin 
[1] and Yih [3].  
Fig. 2 plots the variation of the local Nusselt 
number for the fluid and solid phases,  50.f Ra/Nu  
and 50.s Ra/Nu , with the eccentric angle B of the 
elliptical cylinder for various heat transfer coefficient 
parameters ( =H 0.1, 0.5, and 1), K=1, and b/a=0.6 
and the elliptical cylinder with blunt orientation. 
Comparing the curves in Fig. 2, we can deduce that 
increasing the heat transfer coefficient parameter 
tends to decrease the difference between the local 
Nusselt number of the fluid and solid phases in 
porous media. As the heat transfer coefficient 
parameter increases, the local Nusselt number for the 
fluid phase is decreased while the local Nusselt 
number for the solid phase is increased   
Fig. 3 plots the variation of the local Nusselt 
number for the fluid and solid phases,  5.0/ RaNu f  
and 5.0/ RaNus , with the eccentric angle B of the 
elliptical cylinder for various thermal conductivity 
ratio parameters ( =K 1 and 10), H=0.5, and b/a=0.6 
and the elliptic cylinder with blunt orientation. The 
Nusselt number for the fluid phase is always higher 
than that for solid phase for given values of heat 
transfer coefficients and thermal conductivities; thus 
major part of heat transfer is taken place in the fluid 
phase. Moreover, increasing the thermal conductivity 
ratio parameter tends to decrease the difference 
between the local Nusselt number of the fluid and 
solid phases in porous media. The local Nusselt 
numbers for the fluid and solid phases in porous 
media increase with an increase in the thermal 
conductivity ratio parameter. 
Fig. 4 plots the variation of the local Nusselt 
number for the porous medium 5.0/ RaNu  with the 
eccentric angle B of the elliptical cylinder for various 
heat transfer coefficient parameters ( =H 0.1, 0.5, 
and 1), K=1, and b/a=0.6. For the elliptical cylinder 
with blunt orientation, the local Nusselt number first 
increases with distance from the stagnation point, 
reaches a maximum, and then decreases to zero at the 
top of the elliptical cylinder. For an elliptical cylinder 
with slender orientation, the local Nusselt number 
decreases monotonically from the lower end of the 
cylinder to the upper end of the cylinder; that is due 
to the increase in boundary layer thickness. Moreover, 
comparing the curves in Fig. 4, we can deduce that 
increasing the heat transfer coefficient parameter 
tends to increase the heat transfer rates between the 
porous medium and the wall.  
Fig. 5 shows the local Nusselt number for the 
porous medium 5.0/ RaNu  as functions of the 
eccentric angle B of the elliptical cylinder for various 
thermal conductivity ratio parameters ( =K  1 and 
10), H=0.5, and b/a=0.6. Comparing the curves in 
Fig. 5, we can deduce that increasing the thermal 
conductivity ratio parameter tends to increase the 
heat transfer rates between the porous medium and 
the wall.

Abstract: - This work uses the integral method to study the heat and mass transfer by mixed convection from 
vertical plates with constant wall temperature and concentration in porous media saturated with an electrically 
conducting fluid in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The approximate integral solutions are found to 
be in reasonable agreement with the similarity solutions. Results are plotted for the local Nusselt number, the 
local Sherwood number, and the ratio of the thermal boundary layer thickness to the concentration boundary 
layer thickness. Increasing the buoyancy parameter tends to increase the local Nusselt number and the local 
Sherwood number, while increasing the magnetic parameter decreases the local Nusselt number and the local 
Sherwood number.

1   Introduction 
Many researchers have studied the flows of heat and 
mass transfer by natural convection or by mixed 
convection of Newtonian fluids in porous media 
because of their importance in geophysical and 
geothermal applications, such as the surface mass 
transfer on bed rock generated by chemical reaction, 
the underground disposal of nuclear wastes where the 
failure of canisters may cause the spread of 
radioactive materials, and the spreading of chemicals 
in saturated soil.  
For natural convection heat and mass transfer, 
Khan and Zebib [1] studied the double-diffusive 
instability of the double boundary-layer structure 
near a vertical surface in temperature and 
concentration stratified porous media. Bejan and 
Khair [2] studied the natural convective flows near a 
vertical surface driven by temperature and 
concentration gradients in fluid saturated porous 
media. Lai and Kulacki [3] have examined the natural 
convection boundary layer flow along a vertical 
surface with constant heat and mass flux including 
the effect of wall injection. Nakayama and Hossain 
[4], and Singh and Queeny [5] employed the integral 
method to obtain the analytic solution of couple heat 
and mass transfer due to buoyancy along a vertical 
surface in fluid saturated porous media with constant 
wall temperature and concentration. Cheng [6] 
studied the influence of a magnetic field on the 
coupled heat and mass transfer by natural convection 
from vertical surfaces with constant wall temperature 
and concentration by the integral method.  
For mixed convection heat and mass transfer, Lai 
[7] studied the coupled heat and mass transfer by 
mixed convection from a vertical plate in a saturated 
porous medium. Yih [8] examined the influence of 
transpiration on coupled heat and mass transfer in 
mixed convection over a vertical plate embedded in a 
saturated porous medium.  
 The flows of electrically conducting fluids over 
surfaces in the presence of a transverse magnetic 
field are of much importance because of various 
geophysical and industrial applications [6, 9-10]. 
Aldoss et al. [9] studied the mixed convection from 
vertical surfaces in a porous medium under the effect 
of a magnetic field. Chamkha [10] studied the 
hydromagnetic flow and heat transfer of a 
heat-generating fluid over a surface embedded in a 
porous medium.  
Motivated by the works mentioned above, the 
present work uses the integral method to study the 
problem of laminar boundary layer heat and mass 
transfer by mixed convection from a vertical surface 
with constant wall temperature and concentration in 
porous media saturated with an electrically 
conducting fluid under the influence of a transverse 
magnetic field. The results obtained in the present 
work are compared with the similarity solutions 
obtained by previous studies to check the accuracy of 
the integral method. With the closed form analytical

3   Problem Solution 
In order to verify the accuracy of our present integral 
mrethod, we compare the present results for the 
Nusselt number with those obtained by Hsieh et al. 
[11] for mixed convection heat transfer along a 
vertical surface with constant wall temperature 
embedded in a fluid-saturated porous medium 
( 0=N , 1=Le , and 0=M ), as shown in Table 1. It 
is clearly seen from the table that the present integral 
results are in acceptable agreement with the 
similarity solutions reported by Hsieh et al. [11].  The 
absolute value of maximum percentage error found in 
Table 1 is about 3.88 %.  
Fig. 1 depicts the variation of the local Nusselt 
number PeNu  with the buoyancy parameter 
PeRa  for various values of the magnetic parameter 
M . The results show the local Nusselt number 
dereases with a increase in the magnetic parameter 
and increases with higher values of the buoyancy 
parameter. The reason for such a behavior is that 
incresing the buoyancy parameter implies increasing 
the buoyancy force, accelerating the flow and thus 
increasing the heat transfer between the fluid and the 
wall. Enhancing the magnetic field tends to decrease 
the fluid flow velocity and thus decreases the local 
Nusselt number.

Fig. 4 shows the influence of the buoyancy ratio 
N  on the local Sherwood number PeSh . The 
local Sherwood number PeSh  tends to increase 
as the buoyancy ratio N  is increased. That is 
because an increase in the buoyancy ratio tends to 
accelerate the flow, thinning the concentration 
boundary layer and thus enhancing the mass transfer 
near the wall.  
The effect of the buoyancy ratio N  on the ratio 
of the thermal boundary layer thickness to the 
concentration boundary layer thickness ∆  is

that an increase in the buoyancy ratio tends to 
increase the ratio of the thermal boundary layer 
thickness to the concentration boundary layer 
thickness.  
Fig. 6 shows the effect of the Lewis number Le  
on the local Nusselt number PeNu . Comparing 
the three cases in Fig. 6, we can conclude that as the 
Lewis number Le  is increased, the local Nusselt 
number PeNu  tends to decrease for aiding flow 
( 0>N ). The influence of the Lewis number Le  on
