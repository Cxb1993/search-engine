The major issue in shot change detection is to 
design a mechanism that can partition video sequence 
into shots which represent a meaningful event or a 
continuous sequence of action [10]. With regard to 
sports video, Fig. 1 shows a typically hierarchical 
structure of baseball. We may notice that a robust shot 
change detection is able to provide the ground for 
baseball video abstraction and high-level video event 
(pitch, in-field, out-field, close-up) or highlight (hit, 
home run) extraction. The video production will 
carefully design specific transition types in order to 
support the content and context of a video, only if a 
reliable shot detection is available. Shot change can be 
classified into two types: abrupt and gradual transitions. 
Abrupt change is very easy to detect because it appears 
a peak difference in the time axis by short-term analysis. 
But, gradual transitions are more difficult to detect as 
the difference between frames corresponding to two 
successive shots is indistinguishable. We have observed 
some properties for short-term and long-term variation 
as follows:  
1. The short-term variation is sensitive to the noise, 
such as fast object(s) motion or the camera flash. 
2. The short-term variation is improper to be used to 
detect gradual transitions because the changes 
between frames are small. 
3. The cumulative differences between the frames to 
detect shot change will highly depend on 
threshold selection and video type. 
4. The long-term variation considers the difference 
of two frames which stride across L  successive 
frames, but it has drawback that the frame 
difference is very sensitive due to the longer 
frames distance.   
In this report, the combination of short-term and 
long-term motion compensation of successive frames is 
used to observe the local variation and inter-shot 
variation for detecting various shot changes in baseball 
videos. 
  
3. The Proposed Methods 
 
In this section, we introduce various shot change 
models based on short-term and long-term block-based 
motion compensation in uncompressed domain. For 
motion estimation, the Improved Three-Steps Search 
(ITSS) [11] block-matching algorithm is adopted. 
Besides, a statistical adaptive threshold for video 
dependency, and the uncompensated rate will be utilized 
to avoid false alarm which is caused by captions or 
scoreboard in sports video. 
 
3.1. Abrupt shot change model 
 
The abrupt transition is a huge change between two 
frames. We define the abrupt shot model as 
 
where 1S  and 2S  are two continuous shots, and bN  is 
the cut time. 
In short-term, when the position n  is less or larger 
than bN (e. g. timestamps c, e, f in Fig. 2), the 
motion compensation can be done between each two 
successive frames in shot S1 and S2 individually. 
Therefore, the short-term difference of residual frames 
will be almost a constant. While bn N=  (timestamp d) , 
the motion compensation between the frame 
1( , , 1)bS x y N −  and 2 ( , , )bS x y N  will not be achieved, 
and the short-term difference of residual frame will be 
very large. In other words, an obvious peak will appear 
at the beginning of shot change in the time axis. 
Considering long-term situation, we define L  as a 
long-term distance. We will discuss long-term variation 
during b bN n N L≤ ≤ + (time slot between d and f). 
If bn N= , the transition of current frame 2 ( , , )bS x y N  
and reference frame 1( , , )bS x y N L− are two different 
shots, so they are not compensated. Therefore, the peaks 
will last L frames, until the current and reference frames 
are in the same shot. 
In Fig. 2, the short and long term difference curve 
can interpret abrupt shot change model.

3.2. Gradual transition models 
 
 We have observed several characteristics of the 
gradual transition boundary. From the observations, we 
found that the cuts in the fade-in and fade-out transition 
are distinguishable, and then conclude that the timing of 
transition is on the beginning a shot for fade-in type, 
and on the end for fade-out type. In addition, the 
transitions of dissolve and wipe have no obvious 
boundary. Furthermore, we introduce fade-out/fade-in 
transition model. 
 
3.2.1. Fade-in 
Fade-in transition is the next shot that gradually 
appears from a full frame with a certain color (fully 
white or black), and the fade-in transition model can be 
formulated as:

In long term situation, the variation of long-term in 
the dissolving transition ( b eN n N≤ ≤ ) is an increasing 
function of l ; while e eN n N L< ≤ +  , the variation of  
each residual frame in dissolving transition is decreasing, 
both can be proved in Eq. (11) and (12) respectively. 
Therefore, in the duration of b eN n N L≤ ≤ + , there is a 
parabolic curve as shown in Fig. 5, which is an obvious 
feature for detecting dissolving transition.

curve of dissolving shot change model. 
 
3.2.4. Wiping 
The wiping transition is defined as the next shot 
that gradually show up and wipes out the current shot. 
The uncompensated region size and allocation can be 
used to analyze the speed and types of wiping. The 
proposed dissolving and wiping transition models have 
no obvious variation in the short-term, and both of the 
models have parabolic curve in the long-term. In this 
report, we aim to propose a reliable shot boundary 
detection model for high-level events extraction in 
sports video. From efficiency viewpoint, we use the 
same model to detect dissolving and wiping transition. 
The reason is that if shot changes have been detected, it 
is not always necessary to classify whether they are 
dissolving or wiping for high-level semantic (e. g. left-
right, top-down, diagonal and circular etc.). 
 
3.2.5. Fade-out/fade-in model 
The fade-out/fade-in transition model describes 
that the current shot gradually disappears and follows a 
blank frame, after that, the next shot gradually appears 
from the blank frame. The unobtrusive special effect can 
be formulated as follows. 
where CN  is the location of constant frame C , 
10 ( )C bl N N≤ ≤ − and 20 ( )e Cl N N≤ ≤ − . 
While b CN n N≤ ≤ and C eN n N< ≤ , the short-
term features are same as fade-out and fade-in 
transitions, both of them have almost a constant given in 
Eq. (7) and (4) respectively. When Cn N= (timestamp 
d in Fig. 6), the short-term variation defined in Eq. (14), 
and is a constant either. There is no obvious variation of 
the short-term, so the curve in Fig. 6 is relatively flat. 
In long term situation, b CN n N≤ ≤ , the variation is 
same as fade-out long term feature, which is an 
increasing function as shown in Eq. (8). 
When e eN n N L< ≤ +  (timestamp f), the variation can 
be determined from Eq. (15), which is a decreasing 
function in the duration. 
The variation has decreasing tendency in the duration of

shown in Fig. 6.
