Abstract: 
The advancement of CMOS technology to 
nanoscale regime has driven MOSFET fT to 
super-100GHz and makes RF CMOS an attractive 
technology in realizing high frequency communication 
ICs due to the advantages of high speed, high 
integration and low cost. The nanoscale CMOS devices 
become a key element in RF ICs, attributed to the 
features of high speed and easy integration with 
standard logic circuits. However, the abnormally large 
RF noises measured from sub-100nm MOSFETs with 
miniaturized dimensions emerges as a critical concern 
in RF circuit design and fabrication using nanoscale 
CMOS technology. In our previous work, a lossy 
substrate model was developed, which can accurately 
simulate measured RF noise in sub-100 nm MOSFETs 
with various N and  WF. Furthermore, the intrinsic RF 
noise can be extracted easily and precisely by the lossy 
substrate de-embedding using circuit simulation. The 
extracted intrinsic NFmin at 10 GHz can be pushed to as 
low as 0.5 dB for 65nm nMOS that is around 0.2 dB 
lower than 80nm counterpart. The results suggest the 
advantages of aggressive gate length scaling to 
sub-100nm regime. 
The successful prediction from lossy substrate 
model for measured noise suggests that most of the 
excess noises were contributed from the lossy substrate 
coupled through GSG pads and TML. What’s worse, 
the excess noises increase dramatically with device 
miniaturization and dominate the intrinsic noise, as a 
major factor responsible for the degradation of RF 
circuit performance. As a result, an effective noise 
shielding method for suppressing RF noise in 
nanoscale devices becomes a major subject worthy of 
extensive research effort. In this third year project, RF 
noise shielding methods with various structures were 
implemented and the corresponding equivalent circuit 
models were developed for simulating noise shielding 
effect on nanoscale devices. Note that, the equivalent

Fig. 1 3D RF test structures with different shielding schemes 
(a) standard without shielding (b) TML shielding (c)pad 
shielding, and the corresponding equivalent circuit model. 
 
Two different shielding schemes were 
implemented as RF noise shielding methods in 
miniaturized devices for low noise RF CMOS design. 
0.13μm BEOL process with 8 layers of Cu and FSG as 
IMD was used to fabricate the noise shielding 
structures. G-pads for grounding were constructed with 
stacked metals from M1 to M8. S-pads for signal 
supply were built from M2 to M8, i.e. stacked metals 
excluding M1. The preserved M1 is employed as the 
noise shielding plate deployed under the TML and pad, 
defined as TML shielding and pad shielding 
respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates the 3D structures for 
DUT, GSG pads, TML, and the proposed shielding 
schemes. Fig.1(a) is a standard structure without 
shielding. On the other hand, Fig.1(b) and (c) illustrate 
those with TML and pad shielding respectively. 
Following the test structures, equivalent circuit models 
adapted to two shielding schemes can be easily 
developed based on our original lossy substrate model 
in Fig.1(a). For an ideal shielding, the substrate loss 
can be eliminated and then the substrate RLC networks 
(RSi, CSi, LSi, and CP) under the TML or pad can be 
removed to leave a simple capacitor, as shown in 
Fig.1(b) and (c). 
   The definition of lossy substrate model parameters 
and extraction method can be referred to our original 
work [6-7]. A perfect shielding can eliminate substrate 
loss and remove substrate networks under the pad and 
TML. Then, the original lossy substrate model is 
reduced to a simple capacitor, such as Cpad and Cox 
corresponding to pad and TML shielding. Note that 
Cpad and Cox can be calculated from layout and process 
parameters to serve as the initial values. This simplified 
equivalent circuit can reduce the parameter extraction 
flow. The model parameters extracted in this reduced 
flow assuming an ideal shielding, act as an initial 
model for further optimization to ensure accuracy over 
extremely high frequency. 
  Table 1 summarizes a full set of model parameters 
extracted through an optimal fitting to the measured 
S-parameters up to 50 GHz. The results indicate that 
pad shielding can fully eliminate substrate network 
under the pad but TML shielding cannot. It suggests 
that pad shielding enables a more effective isolation 
against substrate loss compared with TML shielding. 
Note that pad shielding leads to a dramatic increase of 
Cpad by around 2.5 times and may degrade high 
frequency performance due to the added parasitic 
capacitance. Fig. 2 presents open pad S-parameters 
over a broadband of 50 GHz, and a good agreement 
between measurement and simulation using the 
optimized lossy substrate models adapted to various 
shielding schemes.

Regarding NF50, the noise figure normally used in 
the practice of RF circuit design reveals an interesting 
result in shielding effect. Fig. 6 demonstrates a 
significant increase of NF50 corresponding to pad 
shielding that is going a direction opposite to what 
NFmin behaves. The adverse effect on NF50 from 
shielding is considered due to lack of admittance 
matching for compensating excess capacitances 
introduced by shielding plate. The proposed mechanism 
is supported by a consistent correlation with the 
degradation of fT shown in Fig. 6(a). The dramatic drop 
of fT incurred by shielding can explain the increase of 
NF50 accelerated at higher frequency. The result 
provides an important guideline in RF circuit design 
that an appropriately selected inductor is indispensable 
to realize a compensation for parasitic capacitances, 
which is particularly critical for low noise design 
incorporating shielding schemes.

Note that noise simulation based on an improved 
thermal noise model (a replacement of default noise model 
in BSIM3) and the proven lossy substrate model can 
accurately predict the measured noise parameters. The 
major features incorporated in the improved noise model 
are short channel effects (velocity saturation, CLM, and 
carrier heating), substrate resistance induced potential 
fluctuation effect in drain current noise, and gate resistance 
induced excess noises in both drain and gate current 
noises. 
 
V. Conclusion 
    
   RF noise shielding methods have been implemented 
and demonstrated an effective suppression of NFmin in 100 
nm MOSFETs. A lossy substrate model incorporating 
inductive impedances in the substrate network can 
accurately predict substrate loss effect over extremely high 
frequency up to 50 GHz and the impact on noise 
parameters. The extended lossy substrate model adapted to 
noise shielding schemes proves the noise reduction due to 
elimination of substrate loss through the removal of 
substrate RLC network from the original one without 
shielding. The adverse effect on NF50 from shielding 
reveals an impact from the introduced excess capacitances 
and suggests an appropriate compensation required for RF 
circuit design. The proposed noise shielding methods and 
lossy substrate models with proven broadband accuracy 
for various shielding schemes can facilitate low noise RF 
CMOS design.
