Key words: Groundwater, unconfined aquifer, anisotropic, analytical solution  
 
Because the pump-and-treat method can be used to remove significant quantities of 
dissolved contaminants, it has been used widely to be a favorable alternative technology for the 
remediation of contaminated groundwater.  This paper will derive a new analytical solution in 
terms of the hydraulic head distribution in a homogeneous, anisotropic, and sloping unconfined 
aquifer with transient recharge and multiple injection and/or extraction wells.  
The newly derived solution can be used: (1) to describe the hydraulic head distribution and 
flow system in an anisotropic unconfined aquifer with a sloping bed and arbitrarily located 
multiwells under transient recharge, (2) to delineate the capture zone and design the 
pump-and-treat system for groundwater remediation, (3) to perform the sensitivity analysis for 
the hydrogeological parameters in the mathematical model, and (4) to identify the hydraulic 
parameters when coupling with an optimization approach to analyze the aquifer data. 
INTRODUCTION 
The pump-and-treat method has been widely used as an alternative technology for the 
remediation of contaminated groundwater since it can be used to remove significant quantities of 
dissolved contaminants.  Optimal design of a contaminated groundwater capture system is 
crucial to the success of the pump-and-treat effort.  Therefore, analytical solutions for 
determining capture zones and stagnation points have been suggested by many researchers 
 aquifer system are shown in Fig. 1.  The wells can be injected and pumped at any arbitrary point.  
The aquifer is receiving localized time varying recharge from a rectangular basin, and the 
impervious base of the aquifer is inclined along the x-axis.  Assume that the aquifer is 
homogeneous but anisotropic and the rate of recharge compared to the hydraulic conductivity 
being so small that the vertically added water to the water table flows almost horizontally.  
Furthermore, the Dupuit’s assumptions are applicable in this aquifer that the vertical hydraulic 
gradient is small and negligible (Schwartz and Zhang, 2003).  The equation governing the 
groundwater flows with multiple injection-pumping wells is formulated as:

where H=h2, h is the variable groundwater head, W and L are the width and length of the aquifer, 
Kx and Ky are respectively the hydraulic conductivity in the x and y direction, xi and yi are the 
coordinates of the injection or pumping wells, p is the number of wells, δ is the Dirac delta

q is the slope of the base, D is the mean depth of saturation, κ =D/ Sy, t is the time of observation, 
and R(t) is the time varying rate of recharge.  The rate of recharge is defined as (Ramana et al.

where α  is the decay constant.  Eq. (2) implies that the recharge rate exponentially decreases 
from an initial value R1+R0 to a lower value R1 and thereafter remains constant.  The initial and 
boundary conditions are respective described as: 
0)0,,( =yxH                                                                 (3)

Since the governing equation, the initial condition and boundary conditions are specified, the 
solution of hydraulic head in a homogeneous, anisotropic, and sloping unconfined aquifer with 
transient recharge and arbitrarily located multiwells can be obtained via the finite sine transform 
and eigenvalue-eigenfunciton method for Eqs. (1)-(4).  The result can be expressed as

 As shown in Fig. 2, the aquifer is 500 m × 500 m, and two real extraction wells with the 
rate of 8.64 m3/day are located at (400 m, 200 m) and (400 m, 300 m), and one real injection well 
with the rate of 4.32 m3/day is placed at (150 m, 250 m).  The hydraulic conductivities Kx and Ky 
are 0.5 and 0.25 m/day, respectively.  The boundary heads at x=0 and x=L are respectively kept 
at h1=10 m and h2=8 m, and no-flow boundaries are imposed on the sides of y=0 and y=W in the 
first example.  The field is extended for image wells, and the shaded area shown in Fig. 6(a) 
represents the concerned field with real wells and other dotted squares are for image wells.  The 
image wells should extend to infinity in theory, but it is known that pairs of image wells closet to 
real well yield an acceptable head change because others have a negligible influence on the head 
change (Yeo and Lee, 2003).  The exponentially recharge rate is 0.0371e0.571t for 100 days, the 
slope of aquifer is 8% and the specific yield is 0.05.  The hydraulic gradient at (x, y) can be 
determined by talking partial derivatives of Eq. (5) with respect to x and y, respectively. 
Head distribution and gradient shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that contaminated groundwater, 
if happened, can be restrained in the central area by the combination of two extraction and 
injection wells.   
Example 2 
Figure 3 shows the geometry of real and images wells for the aquifer of 500 m × 500 m 
with two no-flow boundaries are intercepted at a right angle.  The conductivities Kx and Ky are 
0.5 m/day, and one real extraction well with the rate of 8.64 m3/day are located at (400 m, 400 m), 
and three real injection wells with the same rate are placed at (200 m, 250 m), (100 m, 400 m), 
and (300 m, 150 m).  Similarly, the exponentially recharge rate is 0.0371e0.571t m/day for 100 
days, the slope of aquifer is 8% and the specific yield is 0.05.  Figure 3 shows head distributions 
and gradients for the hypothetical aquifer with time varying recharge, which illustrates a good 
containment of contaminated groundwater by the multiwells. 
These two examples demonstrate that this new analytical solution is useful for the easy 
calculation of the hydraulic distribution and gradient in a complex flow field by multiwells and 
time varying recharge in a sloping unconfined aquifer.  Consequently, this solution can be used 
to delineate the capture zone and design the pump-and-treat system for groundwater remediation. 
 
4. Conclusions 
A mathematical model for representing the groundwater flow system in a homogeneous, 
anisotropic, and sloping unconfined aquifer with transient recharge and multiple injection and/or 
extraction wells is presented.  The results demonstrate that the water table profiles are 
significantly influenced by the transient recharge, the isotropy, and the slope of the aquifer.  
Furthermore, the results also illustrate the hydraulic head distributions and gradients for the 
sloping unconfined aquifer with transient recharge and multiple wells. 
The newly derived solution can be used: (1) to describe the hydraulic head distribution and 
flow system in an anisotropic unconfined aquifer with a sloping bed and arbitrarily located 
multiwells under transient recharge, (2) to delineate the capture zone and design the 
pump-and-treat system for groundwater remediation, (3) to perform the sensitivity analysis for 
the hydrogeological parameters in the mathematical model, and (4) to identify the hydraulic

sine transform and Hankel transform to treat the cases of an infinite or a finite wedge for a wedge-shaped 
aquifer.  Yeh and Chang (2006) solved an analytical solution by applying the finite sine transform and Hankel 
transform for the hydraulic head distribution in a wedge-shaped aquifer with various topographic boundary 
conditions.  In the above mathematical models, the pumping behavior of the test well is characterized in the 
governing equation via the Dirac Delta function which restricts the test well to have infinitesimal diameter.  
All studies which have been devoted to the development of an analytical solution of a CFT in the vicinity of 
topographic boundaries are based on the assumption of a well of infinitesimal diameter.  Yet, ignoring the 
influence of a finite test-well diameter may lead to errors in the predicted drawdown near the test well. 
On the other hand, several researches had focused on problems of CHT performed in the vicinity of an 
aquifer boundary.  Unlike the treatment in a CFT, one cannot directly apply the image-well method to a CHT.  
Superposing the drawdown produced by each image well will violate the condition of constant drawdown at the 
test well.  Murdoch and Franco (1994) used an instantaneous source function and the convolution method to 
deal with various geometries of flow problem and presented approximate expressions which could conform to 
the condition of constant drawdown at a test well.  Renard (2005) summarized the concept of Murdoch and 
Franco (1994) in formulating the semi-analytical discharge rate and drawdown response, and proposed a 
weighted-mean approximation in the evaluation of the discharge for a CHT near a recharging boundary.  
However, the analytical solution of a CHT performed in a wedge-shaped aquifer, to the best of our knowledge, 
has never been presented. 
The objective of this paper is to derive analytical solutions for drawdown distribution of CFT as well as 
discharge rates and drawdown distribution of CHT in a wedge-shaped aquifer by taking the influence of a well 
of finite diameter into account.  Our drawdown solution of CFT is compared with the corresponding solutions 
based on the assumption of a well of infinitesimal diameter.  Finally, we investigate the behavior of specific 
well discharge of the CFT and CHT for various types of topographic boundaries.   
 
2. Mathematical Formulation 
2.1. Mathematical models of CFT and CHT in an infinite extent aquifer 
When the image wells are placed into a finite aquifer system, the evaluation of the drawdown in the test 
well or at an arbitrary-located observation well is simplified to one of adding the effects of real and image wells 
in an infinite aquifer.  This section formulates the models and solutions of the CFT and CHT in an infinite 
confined aquifer.  The assumptions of the aquifer and well configurations are: (1) the confined aquifer is 
homogeneous, isotropic, and of a constant thickness, and (2) the test well of a finite diameter penetrates the 
entire thickness of a confined aquifer. 
We cast the problem in dimensionless terms by defining the following groupings:  
Sr
tTt
r
rr
s

w
D

,, ===                    (1)   
where Ds ( ( )DDD trs , ) is the dimensionless drawdown, Dr  is the dimensionless radial distance, Dt  is the 
dimensionless time, s is the drawdown, s0 is the initial drawdown, r is the radial distance from the centerline of 
For the sake of simplicity, in this study, the wedge angle of the wedge-shaped aquifer is assumed to be an 
aliquot part of 360°.  The number of the image wells required in analyzing the flow toward the test well is 
given by the relation (Ferris et al., 1962):  
1360 −°= φn                              (9) 
where φ refers to the wedge angle.   
Fig. 1 shows the image-well system in a wedge-shaped aquifer where the denotations of image wells are 
named in a clockwise sequence.  The type of image well, namely extracts or injects water from/into a well, is 
dependent upon the nature of aquifer boundaries.  Once the dimensionless distances 1Dl  and Dnl  are known, 
the dimensionless distances Dml  from the center of test well to the center of image wells can be obtained by 
using the Cosine law as:

2.3. Analytical solutions for a CFT in a wedge-shaped aquifer  
Since the governing equation and boundary conditions are linear, the principle of superposition can be 
directly applied to the solution (5) of the CFT.  For a CFT performed near aquifer boundaries, the use of 
image-well method in solving the drawdown at an observation well requires first to determine the location and 
operation types of the image wells, and then superpose the individual dimensionless drawdown Dfs~  due to the 
real and each image well.  Based on Eq. (5), the resultant dimensionless drawdown responses can be expressed 
as:

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Comparison with other solutions 
In this section, we compare our CFT solution to the corresponding result obtained by two other solutions 
that deal with similar problems.  The first solution is based on superposition as the sum of the individual Theis 
solution (1935), assuming a well of infinitesimal diameter, where the Theis solution (1935) is expressed as

function (or the exponential integral) of tTSru 42* = .  Accordingly, this solution based on an assumption of 
infinitesimal diameter is referred to as the Theis-based solution. 
The second solution was given by Chan et al. (1978) who employed the finite sine transform and the 
Hankel transform to derive the drawdown solution for pumping at an infinitesimal well in a wedge-shaped 
aquifer.  For a case where a wedge-shaped aquifer restricting by two recharging boundaries, Chan et al.’s 
solution (1978) can be written as:

and 
CFT and CHT in a wedge-shaped aquifer with various types of topographic boundaries are equivalent at large 
Dt .  This behavior is consistent with that observed by Jacob and Lohman (1952). In addition, the equivalence 
of the specific well discharges between CFT and CHT at sufficiently large value of time, indicated by Mishra 
and Guyonnet (1992), is also valid at every point in an infinite-extent aquifer. 
 
4. Conclusions 
New solutions that describe the drawdown response of an observation well to the CFT and CHT, 
respectively, and the discharge at a test well for the CHT in a homogeneous, isotropic, confined and 
wedge-shaped aquifer are derived by accounting for the influence of a well of finite diameter.  The CFT 
solution is based on the Laplace transform and the image-well methods.  For a CHT, the convolution method 
conjunction with an instantaneous source function is employed to satisfy the test-well condition, and the 
image-well method is used to account for the topographic boundary property.  The time-domain solutions are 
then derived by the Bromwich integral method.   
The comparison of our CFT solution to the solutions based on the assumption of a well of infinitesimal 
diameter is performed.  It appears that ignoring the influence of a well of finite diameter leads to a significant 
error in the predicted early-time drawdown distribution.  In addition, the calculated result of dimensionless 
specific well discharge in a wedge-shaped aquifer depend on the type of aquifer test at early dimensionless time 
and is influenced by the nature of the aquifer boundary at later dimensionless time, no matter at a test well or an 
observation well.  The dimensionless specific well discharges of CFT and CHT both decrease with the 
dimensionless time and are equivalent at large time for various types of topographical boundaries.
