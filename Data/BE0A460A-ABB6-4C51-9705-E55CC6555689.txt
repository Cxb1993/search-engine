Abstract 
Bias-corrected fuzzy c-means (BCFCM) 
algorithm with spatial information has been 
proven effective for image segmentation. 
Although BCFCM can raise its insensitivity to 
noise to some extent, it still lacks enough 
robustness to noise and outliers. Recently, a 
Gaussian kernel-based fuzzy c-means algorithm 
(GKFCM) with a spatial bias correction was 
proposed to solve the shortcoming. It is very 
robust to outlier and image artifacts and can 
automatically learn the parameter by the 
prototype-driven learning scheme. However, 
GKFCM algorithm still has the following 
drawbacks: (1) the computational time is 
consuming, especially for segmenting a large 
image, the larger the size of the image, the more 
computational time; and (2) it is sensitive to the 
weighting exponent m. In this project, we will 
study and adopt the suppressed and magnified 
membership idea to speed up the convergence 
speed, and incorporate kernel-based fuzzy 
c-means algorithm to propose robust 
kernel-based fuzzy c-means algorithm (RKFCM) 
to improve the drawbacks of GKFCM. The 
proposed RKFCM algorithm has fast 
convergence speed and robust properties: (1) 
robust to m;(2) robust to outlier and imaging 
artifacts. Finally, this algorithm is applied in 
MRI image segmentation.

overcome the parameter problem. The

3.2 Modify membership degree by 
magnifying and suppressing 
  To accelerate the convergence speed of FCM, 
there are many researches in the literature. 
(Cannon et al.,1986; Kamel and Selim,1994; 
Pal and Bezdek,2002). Among them, the 
suppressed and magnified membership idea is 
simple and effective.  
  The magnifying and suppressing membership 
degree are briefly below: 
  If the data point jx  has the largest 
membership in the p th cluster of all c clusters, 
the value is noted as pju ; jx  has the second 
largest membership in the s th cluster of all 
clusters, the value is noted as sju . After being 
modified and suppressed, the memberships of 
jx  are modified as:

  The idea of Wei and Xie (2000) is by 
magnifying the largest membership degree and 
suppressing the second largest membership 
degree to improve convergence speed. But it 
only pays attention to the largest and the second 
largest membership degree. If the selection of 
parameter α  is not suitable, it might disturb 
the original order and lead the convergence is 
not assured. Fan et al. (2003) proposed the 
suppressed FCM(S-FCM) clustering algorithm 
to overcome it. S-FCM algorithm magnifies the 
largest membership degree and suppresses the 
others, and has fast convergence speed for a 
5 
RKFCM is  much faster than KFCM and 
GKFCM. The RKFCM actually reduces the 
computational complexity , produces 
satisfactory results under noise and has robust 
property to weighting exponent m . See 
table1-4. It also well used in MRI segmentation.

Abstract-This paper presents a kernel-based fuzzy 
c-means algorithm with partition index maximization, 
called KPIM algorithm. The proposed KPIM 
algorithm is more robust than the partition index 
maximization algorithm proposed by Özdemir and 
Akarum[1]. Experiments show that the advantage of 
KPIM are robust properties: (1) robust to fuzziness 
parameter m, (2) robust to outlier, (3) robust to image 
artifacts; and fast computational performance. 
Especially, KPIM can overcome drawbacks of PIM, 
and are well used in image segmentation.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Clustering algorithm is a good method for 
exploring data analysis. FCM is the well-known and 
widely used method, but it still has several drawbacks. 
Therefore, many extension of the FCM algorithm 
have been proposed in the literature to overcome and 
improve the drawbacks. These extended types of FCM 
algorithm, such as  PCM [2], PFCM [3], PIM and 
ICS [1],[4] et.  
  Özdemir and Akarum [1] proposed a partition 
index maximization (PIM) algorithm by adding the 
partition coefficient (PC) [5] into the FCM objective 
function and successfully applied PIM for a color 
quantization of images. This modification can form 
a cluster kernel for each cluster and data points 
inside the cluster kernel will have membership 
values zero or one is similar to the algorithms of 
FCS [6]. The cluster kernel concept and robust 
properties are not discussed in Özdemir and Akarum 
[1]. Although PIM is robust to outlier to some 
extents, it still lacks enough robustness to noise and 
outliers, and sensitive to fuzziness parameter m. 
 In this paper, we will use the kernel-induced trick 
based on the idea of Chen and Zhang [7] to modify 
the PIM object function. We then propose the Kernel 
version Fuzzy clustering algorithm based on 
partition index maximization, called KPIM. The 
proposed KPIM algorithm can overcome the 
drawbacks of PIM. Numerical and image 
experiments are performed and show that our 
proposed KPIM has better performance than PIM 
and FCM. Especially, KPIM are well used in image 
segmentation. The outline of the paper is as follows. 
In section 2, The Kernel-based FCM algorithm with 
partition index maximization (KPIM) is proposed. 
The cluster kernel and robust property of KPIM are 
also introduced and discussed. In section 3, we 
 3
in which each cluster contains a cluster center and 
a cluster kernel. The volume of each cluster kernel 
is decided by the term α . In our KPIM, crisp and 
fuzzy membership values co-exist. These are 
similar to Wu et al. [6] and not discussed in 
Özdemir and Akarum [1]. To guarantee that no two 
of these c cluster kernels will overlap, α  should 
be chosen as follows: 
)},(min{ '2 ii aad⋅=δα , i 25.00,' ≤≤≠ δi .   (7) 
≤ ( )41 )},(min{ '2 ii aad ≤ ( )41 { }),(1( 'ii aaK−  
Note that the kernel-induced metric is 
),(1),( yxkyxd −= and the value 
( )41 { }),(1( 'ii aaK− = 2)2/)),(1(( ji aaK−  
is square of half of  the distance between cluster 
centers 'ia and ia . Thus, equation (7) should 
guarantee that no two of these c cluster kernels will 
overlap. If δ =0.25, then the KPIM algorithm will 
cluster the data set using the largest kernel for each 
cluster. If δ =0, then the KPIM algorithm will 
cluster the data set with no kernel and will be 
equivalent to the AFCM algorithm proposed by Wu 
and Yang [9]. Thus, the proposed KPIM clustering 
algorithm is summarized as follows:

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
    In this section, we perform two experiments 
to compare the performances of these algorithms 
with a numerical dataset and synthetic image. All 
algorithms are implemented under the same initial 
values and stopping conditions. In the first 
experiment, we consider the data set shown in Fig. 
3 with an outlier. To demonstrate the effect of 
outliers to FCM, PIM, AFCM and KPIM, an outlier 
with the coordinate (80, 0) is added to the data set 
in Fig. 3. The clustering results of FCM, PIM and 
KPIM are shown in Figs. 3(a)~(e), respectively. It 
shows that FCM, PIM with m = 2, δ = 0.1 andδ = 
0.2, are affected by the outlier. However, PIM does 
give good clustering results with m = 4, δ = 0.2 
(see Figs. 3(d)). Figs. 3(e) shows that KPIM gives 
good clustering results with m = 2, δ = 0.2. 
Obviously, our proposed KPIM presents less 
sensitivity to the fuzziness parameter m than PIM 
and more robust to the outlier. The synthetic images

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed KPIM algorithm by 
using a Gaussian kernel-induced metric. Each 
cluster obtained by the KPIM will have a cluster 
kernel. Data points that fall inside any one of the c 
cluster kernels will have crisp memberships and that 
fall outside all of the c cluster kernels have fuzzy 
memberships. The crisp and fuzzy memberships 
co-exist in the KPIM. Experiments show that, 
although PIM could  be robust to outlier to some 
extents, but it needs to adjust the fuzziness 
parameter m to a larger number; it is also heavily 
affected by Gaussian noise in image example. 
However, the proposed KPIM clustering algorithm 
can overcome the above drawbacks and has better 
computation performance. We also showed that the 
robust properties of KPIM: robust to outlier and 
noise; robust to fuzziness parameter m. Overall, 
KPIM actually works better than FCM and PIM. 
Especially, KPIM are well used in image 
segmentation. The KPIM is actually a good 
algorithm for real applications.
