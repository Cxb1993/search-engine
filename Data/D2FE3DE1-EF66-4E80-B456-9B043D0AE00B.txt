2flutter and buffeting aeroelastic stability analysis of cable-supported bridges. Based on experimental
and theoretical techniques, the determination of the flutter derivatives has stimulated[1]. Advanced
system identification techniques have also been used to establish the flutter derivatives from the
results of typical wind tunnel tests [2-3]. Over the previous two decades, artificial neural networks
(ANN) have gradually become known as powerful tools in pattern recognition, signal processing,
control, and complex mapping, because of their excellent capacity for learning and high tolerance to
partially inaccurate data [4]. This paper aims to show how flutter derivatives can be estimated using
ANN to process the dynamic responses of the section model from wind tunnel tests. The database
of flutter derivatives of rectangular section models with various width/depth (B/D) ratios can be
estimated. Moreover, a prediction frame based on ANN can be developed to determine the unknown
flutter derivatives of the other section model without wind tunnel tests by using the previous
database of the flutter derivatives.

TESTS
An artificial neural network frame is a system with inputs and outputs that is based on biological
nerves. The system can consist of many computational elements that operate in parallel and are
arranged in patterns that resemble biological neural nets. The identification frame of a neural
network can be constructed, as depicted in Fig. 1, to predict )(th and )(t from previous
responses, )( ith  and )( it , where i=1, 2,…,n. Various n represents the lag in the output and
input. The neural network in Fig. 1 can be mathematically described as

The expression of equation (1) is similar to the time series AR model. The AR model equates the
equations of motion. Therefore, the dynamic characteristics of the system can be obtained from the
coefficient matrices of AR. The modal characteristic parameters of the section model for different
wind velocities are estimated using weight matrices in the identification frame of neural network.

4. CONCLUSIONS
By adopting artificial neural networks, this work has investigated a procedure for determining the
flutter derivatives of a section model from its dynamic responses in wind tunnel test. In addition, to
predict the flutter derivatives of the rectangular section models without wind tunnel tests, the
prediction frames of neural network are then established based on the given flutter derivatives of the
rectangular section models tested in wind tunnel. The results show that this prediction scheme is
reasonably well. The database of the aerodynamic coefficients expanded by using this ANN
approach will be used to analyze the aeroelastic stability of cable-supported bridge without wind
tunnel test in the preliminary design stage.
