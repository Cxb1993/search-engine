ABSTRACT 
The generation and evolution of shedding vortices induced by a solitary wave 
propagating over a two-dimensional submerged obstacle, a rectangular dike or a vertical 
plate, was investigated experimentally. The vortex shedding process was observed 
qualitatively using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique and particle tracing 
technique. The velocity fields were measured quantitatively using particle image 
velocimetry (PIV). Base on the results of the flow visualization, the comparison of the 
vortex shedding processes between rectangular dike and vertical plate was qualitatively 
made under the same wave condition. It is noted that the process of either rectangular 
model or vertical plate can be divided into four common phases, but the characteristics 
of shedding vortices are different in the same phase. In addition, the velocity similarity 
profiles for the formation of separated shear layer and the formation of vertical jet were 
also quantitatively compared between rectangular dike and vertical plate.

1.INTRODUCTION 
The propagation of water waves 
over a submerged structure is closely 
related to coastal engineering and 
environmental problems such as the 
construction of submerged dike for 
preventing coastal erosion, artificial reef 
for farming of fishery, and natural 
continental shelf along coast. As waves 
propagating over the submerged 
structure, vortices generate in the 
vicinity of the structure due to flow 
separation. The shedding vortices may 
cause scour hole near the foundation of 
submerged structure (Zhuang and Lee 
1996). However, the generation and 
evolution of vortices have not been 
understood. 
A submerged rectangular dike is 
frequently considered as one of the 
simplified model (Mei and Black 1969; 
Ting and Kim 1994; Tang and Chang 
1998; Huang and Dong 1999, 2001). In 
 3
 
Figure 1.  Schematic diagram of 
wave flume. 
Both rectangular dike and vertical 
plate were made of acrylic. The 
submerged model was mounted on the 
bottom of the wave flume. The dike and 
vertical plate have the same spanwise 
width (in the cross tank direction) as the 
wave flume, i.e., B = 50.0 cm. The 
vertical height of model, d, is 3.0 cm. 
The streamwise length of L of the dike is 
6.0 cm, and it is 0.43 cm of the vertical 
plate. To eliminate the influence of the 
after-body dimension of vertical plate, 
the edges of the vertical plates were 
carefully fabricated with a 45 o beveled 
angle. The still water depth, h, used in 
the experiments was 7 cm while the 
wave height of the solitary wave was 1.2 
cm. The origin is defined at the 
downstream edge of the dike, and it is at 
the tip of the vertical plate. The time of t 
= 0 is defined as the instant when the 
wave crest of solitary wave is at x = 0. 
Two flow visualization techniques 
were employed to observe the vortex 
structure in the vicinity of the dike: the 
laser induced fluorescence (LIF) 
technique with a thin-layered fluorescent 
dye and the tracing particles technique. 
In the LIF technique, dye solutions 
containing Rhodamine B and fluorescent 
sodium were used (both adjusted to a 
specific gravity of 1.015 but a different 
emission wavelength).  
For both techniques, a laser beam 
emitted from a 7 W continuous 
argon-ion laser (Coherent 90 series) was 
diverges to form a thin light sheet of 
about 1.5 mm in thickness after passing 
a cylindrical lens. The light sheet entered 
the wave tank vertically through the 
bottom along the center line of the tank 
to illuminate fluorescent dyes or the 
tracing particles. Nikon D100 digital 
camera, were employed to take images 
containing streaklines and pathlines. 
In addition, a particle image 
velocimetry (PIV) system was used to 
measure the quantitative velocity field of 
the vortex structure on the light sheet 
plane. The light source for the PIV 
system includes the 200 mJ Continnum 
Surelite Nd: YAG dual lasers. The image 
recording equipment used in this study is 
a digital cross-correlation camera (TSI 
Pivcam 10-30) with 1016 × 1006 pixel 
resolution and a maximum framing rate 
of 30 fps.. Cross-correlation analysis 
using TSI Insight NT Analysis Software 
is then performed on successive 
frame-pairs to obtain two-dimensional 
velocity fields at a rate up to 10 
frames/sec. 
Simultaneous measurements of 
surface wave profiles and internal 
velocity fields were carried out using a 
wave gauge and PIV system, 
respectively. The experiments for the 
case were repeated up to 15 times. The 
phase average method was used to 
analysis phase variations of the velocity 
fields. Then the flow pattern can be 
compared accurately in the same phase 
between these two models. 
3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 5
in which ξ = 1max /)( byy . Comparing 
the shape of similarity profile between 
rectangular dike and vertical plate in 
Figs. 5 and 6, the velocity overshooting 
is more obvious between –1 < ξ < 1 with 
a rough estimate while the model is the 
vertical plate. It may be caused by the 
rapid velocity variation of incoming 
unsteady flow under solitary wave while 
it is passing through the vertical plate.  
Base on the results, the similarity 
profile in eq.(2) is suitable to describe 
the shape of velocity distribution of this 
formation for both rectangular dike  
and vertical plate, but the 
characteristics of velocity overshooting 
of separated shear layer are different due 
to velocity gradient effected by 
after-body dimension. 
3.4 Similar profile of vertical jet 
The formation of vertical jet appears 
during about 10.0 ≤≤ hgt 24.0 at 
0.0 ≤ y/h ≤ 0.509. The vmax denotes the 
maximum vertical velocity, and xmax is 
the value of x where vmax, occurs. To 
analysis the skew jet that differs from 
traditional jet, b2 and b3 are defined in 
the positions where the vertical velocity 
v is vmax/2 at both sides of the jet. 
As reported in Lin et al. (2005b), 
similarity profile of vertical jet was 
shown in eq.(3): 
[ ] 11)5.0exp( 221
max
+−ε⋅−⋅= cc
v
v  (3) 
in which ε = (x – xmax)/b, and b = b2 
for (x – xmax) > 0 and b = b3 for (x – xmax) 
< 0. The coefficients C1, C2 and 
R-square value in the eq.(3) for these 
two models were also obtained. 
From Figs. 7 and 8, it shows that the 
similarity profile is fitting with 
dimensionless experimental data and in 
good agreement. It indicates that eq.(3) 
can be applied to describe the velocity 
profiles corresponding to the formation 
of vertical jet for both rectangular dike 
and vertical plate, even other rectangular 
models with different aspect ratios. 
4.CONCLUSION 
The flow pattern was investigated 
while a solitary wave propagating over a 
bottom mounted rectangular dike or 
vertical plate using particle image 
velocimetry (PIV) and two flow 
visualization techniques. The results 
demonstrate the differences of vortex 
shedding processes between rectangular 
dike and vertical plate. From quantitative 
results, the xv1 of the vertical plate is 
larger than that of the rectangular dike, 
in the phase of generation and shedding 
of vortices. The values of yv1 of the 
vertical plate are all larger than that of 
the rectangular dike during 
-2.0 ≤≤ hgt 10.0.
