showed that co-combustion of corncob and coal could signiﬁcantly
reduce the NOx emission. The alkali metal elements such as K, Na,
and Ca of corncob have good desulfurization effect and this reduces
the SO2 emission signiﬁcantly. Moreover, because corncob has
higher volatile ratio than coal, the volatile of corncob releases rap-
idly and combusts in the freeboard, leading to higher freeboard
temperatures. However, due to the insufﬁcient combustion time
of volatile, the CO emission concentration increases with the ratio
of corncob in the mixture.
Corner tangential ﬁring technology is originally applied in the
pulverized coal-ﬁred boiler. From the previous studies on the corn-
cob combustion in ﬂuidized-bed combustors, the volatile released
from corncob is carried up from the bed zone and combusts in the
freeboard. In addition, due to the lower solid voidage in the free-

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Combustion fraction
In the course of the corncob burning, the combustion fractions
vary with different combustion modes, resulting in different CO
and NO emission characteristics. In direct and staged combustion
modes, the bed temperature is 750 C and excess air ratio is 83%.
When the secondary/total air ratio is 0, 0.25, 0.375, and 0.5, the
combustion fraction in the bed is 89.47%, 52.24%, 49.23%, and
41.21%, respectively. The combustion fraction in the freeboard
can be obtained by 100% subtracting the value of the bed combus-
tion fraction.
The combustion fraction in the bed zone is near 90% for the
direct combustion mode. In the staged combustion mode, the
oxygen ﬂow rate in the primary air decreases as the secondary/
total air ratio increases, the combustion fraction in the bed zone
goes down to 41.21% and the combustion fraction in the free-
board zone goes up to 58.79%. However, due to the limitation
of mass transfer resistance between bubbles and silicon sand,
the combustion fraction does not decrease in proportion to the
air ﬂow rate in the bed zone (He et al., 1998; Scala and Salatino,
2002).
Moreover, the characteristic of bubbles in the VFBC chamber is
another important factor. The primary air passes through the bed
as bubbles, and the corncob is in a state of emulsiﬁcation. In staged
combustion mode, the ﬂow rate of primary air is lower than that of
direct combustion. Oxygen does not seep into the emulsiﬁcation
well, which limits the combustion of ﬁxed carbon. On the other
hand, the CO and volatile released from corncob in the emulsiﬁca-
tion does not mix with bubbles quickly, resulting in incomplete
combustion; the corncob combustion is still in the anoxic condi-
tion despite abundant oxygen in the bed zone. More CO and vola-
tiles are carried up to the freeboard zone to combust.
In FGR combustion mode, the bed temperature is 700 C. When
the Sb is 100%, 90% and 80%, the combustion fraction in the bed is
41.75%, 25.78%, and 10.45%, respectively. The bed zone combustion
fraction is lower than that of direct combustion and staged com-
bustion, and it decreases with the falling stoichiometric oxygen ra-
tio because the oxygen in the primary air is much lower and the
combustion is incomplete due to the fuel-rich condition in the
bed zone. The volatile released from corncob does not combust
quickly enough in the bed zone and its combustion is completed
in the freeboard zone.
3.2. Effect of the combustion modes on the temperature distribution in
the VFBC
Fig. 2 shows the effects of the combustion modes on the tem-
perature distribution in the VFBC. The temperature of the bed zone,
for example, can be estimated by Eq. (6).
Tb ¼ Qr þ Qm þ Qv  Qi  QlVncf ð6Þ
Fig. 2a is the axial temperature distribution in the VFBC using
staged combustion and direct combustion with different air ratios.
The bed temperature is 750 C. As shown in the ﬁgure, the temper-
ature proﬁles of different air ratios in the VFBC show a similar
trend. The peak temperature appears at the bed surface. The axial
temperatures decrease with the distance from the distributor,
which can be attributed to the heat loss through the wall.
However, there is a distinct difference between the peak tem-
perature of direct and staged combustions. The peak temperature
of direct combustion is lower than that of staged combustion. This
trend is in disagreement with that of coal combustion by Spliethoff
et al. (1996). The probable explanation for this difference is as fol-
lows. First, although direct combustion has a larger value of Qr and
Qm, the lacking of Qv reduced the heat input from the freeboard.
Second, as the total air ﬂow rate stays constant, the ﬁrst air ﬂow
rate in direct mode is the highest, resulting in the greatest ﬂue
gas ﬂow rate in the combustor and the biggest heat loss from
bed zone to freeboard. Third, as a well-known fact, the peak tem-
perature appears when the stoichiometric ratio is near 1.0. How-
ever, the stoichiometric ratio of direct combustion in this
experiment is 1.83, much higher than the theoretical stoichiome-
tric ratio of 1.0.
Some unburned particles and volatile released from corncob are
settled back to the bed surface from the vortexing effect driven by
secondary air. Moreover, the number of particles captured by the
vortex as the secondary air ﬂow rate increases, which increases
their residence time in the bed zone. The stoichiometric ratio in
the bed zone decreases to 1.0 gradually, resulting in higher peak
temperatures.
From Fig. 2a, in the direct combustion mode, the axial temper-
ature has the lowest descending gradient (the difference between
peak temperature and outlet temperature) because the heat taken
out from the bed zone by the ﬂue gas is at its maximum. In the
staged mode, the temperature gradient decreases with the increas-

Author's personal copy
The combustion fraction is only 10.45% when the stoichiometric
oxygen ratio is 80%, and a lower stoichiometric oxygen ratio in the
bed zone means more oxygen is injected from the secondary air to
maintain the total oxygen intake (Qian et al., 2009). More volatile
released by corncob is carried up to the freeboard and reacts with
the secondary air to create NO. As a result, the NO emission con-
centration is the highest when the stoichiometric oxygen ratio in
the bed zone is 80%.
3.4. Comparisons
As seen from Figs. 3 and 4, FGR and staged combustions can re-
duce the NO emission concentration. Under similar working condi-
tions, the NO concentration decreases by 30% in FGR mode, while
15% in staged mode compared with direct combustion.
The reasons for the major NO emission reduction in FGR com-
bustion are as follows: First, CO2 emission is recirculated back to
the bed zone which increases the chance of CO2 reduction reaction
with the char from the corncob to generate CO, which contributes
to NO reduction reaction. Second, a percentage of NO emission is
taken back to the bed zone with the ﬂue gas, and further reduction
in the VFBC is obtained.
4. Conclusion
(1) Combustion fractions vary with different combustion modes
resulting in different CO and NO emission characteristics. (2) The
CO emissions of stage, direct and FGR combustion decrease with
a higher bed temperature. (3) The CO emission goes up then down
and the NO emission decreases with the increasing secondary/total
air ratio in staged combustion mode. (4) The CO and NO emissions
increase with the decreasing stoichiometric oxygen ratio in FGR
mode. (5) Under similar working conditions, the NO emission con-
centration decreases by 30% in FGR mode, and by 15% in staged
mode compared with direct combustion.
