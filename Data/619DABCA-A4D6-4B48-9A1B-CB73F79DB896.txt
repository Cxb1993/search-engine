Abstract
Currently manufacturing system of nonwoven has not presented to make overall planning yet; therefore,
nonwoven products have many shortcomings in manufacturing technology. This project proposes the
intelligent expert system combined with neural network for providing total solution of nonwoven
manufacturing process. The interaction effects of processing parameters will be analyzed by using Taguchi
experimental design method. After selecting suitable orthogonal array, the optimum multi-responses of
processing parameters will be obtained. The significant factors, the depth of needle penetration and needling
penetration, have great impact on the quality characteristics of needlepunched nonwoven fabrics, can be
obtained from analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the response surface methodology. In other words, the
quality characteristics of needlepunched nonwoven fabrics can be effectively controlled by controlling these
factors. The reliability and reproducibility of the experiment were validated with a 95% confidence interval.
In addition, the results of this study proved that both experimental costs and time can be reduced, which meets
the global trends of energy saving and carbon reduction.

1. Introduction
Nonwoven fabrics [1-9] are a type of cloth, which are different from traditional woven fabrics. Under
modern technology, functional nonwoven fabrics for varied and innovative demands are invented and applied.
It is a type of functional fabric, as well as a substitution fabric; it is classified as a high-tech product by textile
industries. The nonwoven fabric is widely applied to clothing, household goods, livelihood, even computers,
filtration, heat preservation, and heat insulation of the space industry. The full range of applications remains
unspecified.
In the past, the processing parameters of needlepunched nonwoven fabrics were adjusted by experience
and the trial and error method; however, such methods are expensive and labor-consuming. The Taguchi
method [10-12] can be applied to improve process quality and reduce experiments, and then to reduce the
3be high as possible, in other words, the tear strength of MD, the tear strength of TD, the tensile strength of
MD, and the tensile strength of TD must be as large as possible. As a result, the Large-is-Best characteristic
was adopted.
Thus, the selected control factors and their level values were used in the 9L orthogonal array as the
criteria of the experiments. Nine experiments were carried out according to the design of the orthogonal array,
and the tear and tensile strengths were tested for each experiment, according to international standard
ISO9073-3 and ISO9073-4- of 10 times each for MD and TD test. The S/N ratio of all experimental data was
calculated according to Equation 1. The results are shown in Table II.
As seen, the main effect analysis was employed to acquire the main effects of each of the control factors,
according to Eqs. 2 and 3, and obtain the optimum factor combination for each single quality characteristic of
the needlepunched nonwoven fabrics. For the tear strength of MD, the optimum factor level combination is
A2, B2, C3, and D3, indicating that the swing rate of the cross-lapper machine is 1500 rpm, the delivery rate
of the cross-lapper machine is 800 rpm, the depth of needle penetration is 14 mm, and the needling
penetration is 60 punches/cm2; for the tear strength of TD, the optimum factor level combination is A2, B2,
C3, and D3, namely, the swing rate of the cross-lapper machine is 1500 rpm, the delivery rate of the
cross-lapper machine is 800 rpm, the depth of the needle penetration is 14 mm, and the needling penetration is
60 punches/cm2; for the tensile strength of MD, the optimum factor level combination is A2, B3, C3, and D2,
meaning the swing rate of the cross-lapper machine is 1500 rpm, the delivery rate of the cross-lapper machine
is 900 rpm, the depth of the needle penetration is 14 mm, and the needling penetration is 50 punches/cm2; and
for the tensile strength of TD, the optimum factor level combination is A2 B3, C3, and D3, namely, the swing
rate of the cross-lapper machine is 1500 rpm, the delivery rate of the cross-lapper machine is 900 rpm, the
depth of the needle penetration is 14 mm, and the needling penetration is 60 punches/cm2. According to the
optimization results of the four quality characteristics, the optimum combinations of single quality are not the
same.
To determine the effect of the various processing parameters on fabrics’quality, ANOVA [17-19] was
used to analyze the quality characteristics of needlepunched nonwoven fabrics. ANOVA can check the
experimental errors and identify variances in error terms in order to determine the effect of each processing
parameter on product quality, used as reference for estimating experiment errors. In ANOVA, F ratio
represents the relation between the factor effect and the error variance. The larger the F ratio, the greater the
impact of the factor on the system. Generally, when the F ratio is greater than 2, the factor effect is considered
significant. When the F ratio is larger than 4, the corresponding factor effect is considered great. According to
Tables III and IV, the most significant factors influencing the tear and tensile strengths of MD/TD are C and D,
i.e. the depth of needle penetration and needling penetration; the square sum of factors A and B is very small,
i.e. the swing rate and delivery rate of the cross-lapper machine, thus, their improvement effects are excluded.
This study included only two significant factors, the depth of needle penetration, and needling
penetration to estimate the S/N ratio of the optimum processing parameter combination, and avoid overrating
the S/N ratio of the optimum condition. According to Eqs. 19 and 20, the CI of tear strength of MD is 0.5785
dB, in other words, the 95% confidence interval of the S/N ratio is 774.3617.2  dB. Therefore, the CI
of the tear strength of TD, the tensile strength of MD, and the tensile strength of TD are 1.4598, 1.0747, and
1.2022 dB, respectively. Their 95% confidence intervals are 4916.40221.2  , 7.72585.5764  ,
and 11.55529.1509  dB, respectively.

74. Conclusion
This study adopted TOPSIS and the Taguchi method to determine the optimum combination of
processing parameters of needlepunched nonwoven fabrics, obtained with the least number of experiments.
From the response table of TOPSIS, the optimum processing parameter combination of needlepunched
nonwoven fabrics process is: swing rate for the cross-lapper machine of 1500 rpm, delivery rate for the
cross-lapper machine of 800 rpm, depth of needle penetration at 14 mm, and needling penetration of 60
punches/cm2. According to ANOVA and response surface methodology, the depth of the needle penetration
and needling penetration are the most significant factors affecting the qualities of needlepunched nonwoven
fabrics. In addition, the percentage of the contribution rate of pooled errors is less than 50%, indicating that
the important factors are effectively handled in the experiment, and produce good accuracy in the
experimental results. Based on ten confirmation experiments, the optimum combination obtained in this study
display four quality characteristics; in other words, the S/N ratios obtained from the experiments are within a
95% confidence interval. This indicates that the selected significant factors are appropriate, and the
experimental results have reproducibility and reliability. The fact that the values of the confirmation
experiments are greater than the experiment value of the L9 orthogonal array proves that this experiment is
able to obtain reliable results from the least number of experiments.
