Abstract 
Chemical gating silicon nanowire 
Schottky-barrier field-effect Transistors (SiNW 
SB-FETs), were demonstrated using surface 
modifications of Si channel by N-(2-Aminoethyl) 
-3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (AEAPTMS) 
and gold nanoparticles (gold NPs). AEAPTMS 
forms siloxane bonds with hydroxyl groups on 
channel surface of SiNW after dehydration and 
serves as a positive gate bias to SiNW SB-FETs. 
On the other hand, negatively charged gold NPs 
coated with citrate ions are anchored on 
AEAPTMS modified Si surface statically and 
serves as a negative gate bias to SB-FETs. By 
connecting these two complementally SiNW 
SB-FETs, an inverter with voltage gain 18 was 
achieved.

二、Background and objective 
CMOS devices have emerged over the 
last 25 years as the predominant technology 
in the microelectronics industry. In the past 
three decades, scientist and engineers make 
tremendous efforts on the reduction of 
MOSFET dimensions. Depletion depths and 
junction depths is one of key challenges for 
CMOS technology and have traditionally 
been controlled by ion-implantation of 
appropriate dopants into selected regions and 
limiting their movement during subsequent 
heat cycles [1]. In pursuit of miniaturation, 
one-dimensional structures, such as 
nanowires and nanotubes were demonstrated 
as building blocks for nanoelectronics. Using 
silicon nanowires (SiNWs) as building 
blocks for CMOS inverter avoids complex 
implantation procedure [3,4]. The SiNWs 
CMOS inverter demonstrated not only very 
low gain but also operated in very high 
voltage [2]. On the other hand, both n- and 
p-type carbon nanotube transistors were 
demonstrated to build the first carbon 
nanotube-based CMOS inverter. The 
electrical properties of carbon nanotube were 
easily affected by doping of O2 or potassium 
in the low temperature [3]. The selective area 
chemical gating of carbon nanotube 
field-effect transistors have also been 
demonstrated [4]. Both center-exposed and 
contact-exposed devices of carbon nanotubes 
with NO2 and NH3 have shown shifts of 
threshold voltage positively and negatively. 
However, placement of nanowires or 
nanotubes for nanoelectronics is a tedious 
task so that wafer-scale fabrication with high 
  
resolved into the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 spin-orbit 
components and is shown in the Figure 4c. 
The binding energy (BE) of the 4f7/2 
component was measured to be 84 eV which 
is almost the same as the bulk gold 
(83.8-84.0 eV) [17]. Figure 5a presents the 
results of experiments performed to build 
gold nanoparticles on patterns by 
amino-functionalized regions of silicon. The 
most significant aspect of the self-assembly 
modification as seen in Fig. 1d, is the almost 
complete absence of physical or chemical 
adsorption on the SiO2 surface, with all 
AuNPs assembly occurring only on the 
aminosilane patterns.  
The fabrication process of the 
SB-MOSFET devices started with silicon on 
insulator (SOI) wafers and thickness of top 
silicon was thinned down to 150-200 Å 
using dry oxidation. Active area was defined 
by e-beam and optical lithography, and then 
etched in 25 wt% tetramethyl ammonium 
hydroxide (TMAH) solution. Metal pads 
were defined by deposition of a 100 Å 
titanium layer and a 500 Å gold layer using a 
thermal evaporation system at a base 
pressure of 1×10-6 torr. After PR lift-off, all 
samples were sintered in the furnace at 350 
 for 5 min N℃ 2 enviroment. Two-step 
annealing treatment, 600℃ for 1st and 850℃ 
for 2nd annealing, was adopted to reduce the 
contact resistance by forming C54-TiSi2 at 
the contact. An opening around desired area 
is defined by photo lithography for exposing 
the channel surface of SB-MOSFET with 
AEAPTMS or AuNPs solution. The 
electrical characteristics (Fig. 2a) recorded 
on the same SB-MOSFET before and after 
the surface modification demonstrate the 
chemical gating effect. Before any chemical 
modification, the threshold voltage of is 
about -1.35 V in the accumulation mode. 
After the AEAPTMS treatment, the 
threshold voltage shifted to -3.75 V. The 
amino group of AEAPTMS molecular was 
protonated into NH3+, it acts like applying a 
positive gate voltage results in shift of 
threshold voltage. After the AuNPs binding 
on the sample surface, the threshold voltage 
shifted to 4.2 V. The carboxyl acid 
absorption surrounding on the AuNPs 
surface was deprotonated into COO-. It’s 
take on more than 15 individual 
SB-MOSFET devices show that this large 
threshold voltage shift is reproducible. 
Specifically, a histogram (Fig. 2b) 
summarizing threshold voltages before and 
after modification yielded average ±  
standard deviation: SiO2 = -2.45 ± 0.90 V, 
AEAPTMS = -4.64 ± 0.72, AuNPs = 4.64 ± 
0.44V. While the study and design 
optimization of SB-MOSFET by chemical 
modification is still ongoing, attempts have 
been made to fabricate simple SB-MOSFET 
circuits. 
A CMOS inverter (a logic NOT gate) 
was constructed by connecting a p-channel 
MOSFET (AuNPs modification) and a 
n-channel MOSFET (AEAPTMS 
modification) in series (Fig. 3a). The AFM 
images show that only one the SB-MOSFET 
had the AuNPs one the channel surface 
between the two devices. The output–input 
(Vout–Vin) voltage response (Fig. 4) of the 
inverter shows constant high voltage output 
with low input. When the input is increased 
to -2 V, the output quickly turns to -6V and 
maintains a low state at higher input voltages. 
Most significantly, the complementary 
inverter exhibits a high voltage gain.  
Differentiation of the measured Vout–Vin 
relation reveals a voltage gain as large as 18 
(Fig 4).  
 
四、Summary 
Based on characterization using AFM, 
SEM and Micro-XPS, the AuNPs and 
AEAPTMS were selective modified on 
patterned area with self-assembly method. In 
addition, the results demonstrated that the 
impact of surface chemical modification on 
the electrical characteristics of SB-MOSFET 
devices. Based on chemical modification 
technology, we demonstrated that a simple 
process to fabricate Schottky-Barrier 
MOSFET (SB-MOSFET) inverter on 
silicon-on-insulator wafer. This work 
represents a significant step toward
