一、研究計畫中文摘要：  
   
隨著網路電話(VoIP)技術的演進，人們期許它有著如公眾電話網路(PSTN)電話般穩定的
服務品質，而 SIP 協定的導入對網路電話世界有著重大的影響。直覺而言、藉由使用更多
的 SIP 伺服器可以用來提升服務的穩定性，然而，如何確保可因此提升服務的有效性及可
得性是一個具有挑戰的議題。 
 在這個計畫中，我們提出一個具有探測能力的網域名稱解譯之簡易機制，用以提高 SIP
網路電話服務的容錯及負載平衡。基本上這個想法是於一個典型 IP 網路上，利用 SIP 用
戶端及 SIP 伺服器端建立連結前，SIP 用戶端必須向網域名稱伺服器(Domain Name Server 
- DNS)尋求 SIP 伺服器端的網域名稱 IP 解譯之特性，將探測的機制加在一個開放原始碼
計畫-網域名稱轉達程式（Domain Name Relay Daemon-DNRD）上，使它變成一個具有探
測能力的網域名稱解譯之負載平衡器（Domain Name Resolution Based Load Balancer - 
DN-LB）。透過此機制，來自 SIP 用戶端的需求可以被平均地分派到經過偵測檢驗為正常
服務的 SIP 伺服器，而此機制並不需要額外架設其他昂貴的網路設備，且不需修改目前標
準的 SIP 協定流程，DN-LB 可以以較低的成本增加 SIP 網路電話服務的可靠及容錯性，且
可將所有 SIP 用戶端的訊息需求負載均勻地分配到後端的 SIP 伺服器群。

二、研究計畫英文摘要：  
 
With the evolvement of the Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, people desire to have a competent 
service quality compared with the voice over PSTN. The introduction of the SIP protocol has a 
profound impact on the VoIP world. Exploiting more SIP servers to raise the service qualities is 
quite intuitive. However, how to assure the efficiency and availability of the service becomes a 
challenging issue.  
 In this project, we propose a lightweight probing-based name resolution scheme to achieve 
high fault-tolerance and load balancing for the SIP VoIP service. Basically, the idea is based on 
intercepting the prerequisite name resolution process in a typical client-server application on the 
IP network. We slightly tag the probing mechanism on to the open project Domain Name Relay 
Daemon (DNRD) to become a domain name resolution based load balancer (DN-LB). Under 
our scheme, all SIP request messages from the SIP clients can be fairly distributed to the 
failure-proof SIP servers in the server farm without building any additional costly intermediate 
node and changing the existing SIP architecture. DN-LB can increase the service reliability and 
fault tolerance for the SIP VoIP service and dispatch the SIP request load from clients to the 
backend servers with a lower cost.

當SIP呼叫用戶端(擁有IP為IP-A)呼叫SIP被叫用戶端(擁有IP為IP-B)時， 
[A] DN-LB定期透過發送檢測封包到後端SIP伺服器群中的SIP伺服器(此例中為SIP 
Server1，其擁有IP為IP-1)檢測是否正常運作，若SIP Server1正常運作，SIP Server1會
在timeout之前回應此探測封包給DN-LB，以使DN-LB得知SIP Server1正常運作；若
DN-LB未在timeout之前收到來自SIP Server1的回應，視為SIP Server1目前非正常運
作，而DN-LB會挑選第一個最近未被使用的SIP伺服器繼續探測，依此類推地依序探
測出可以正常運作的SIP伺服器。在此例中，SIP Server1正常回應，所以會將DN-LB
上的SIP伺服器(Serving SIP Server)網域解譯IP設為IP-1，即目前提供SIP服務的伺服器
為SIP Server1。 
[B] 所有的SIP用戶端之預設DNS設為DN-LB的IP，SIP呼叫用戶端在嘗試送出SIP訊息
給SIP被叫用戶端前，會透過向DN-LB查詢，以取得預設於呼叫用戶端的SIP伺服器的
IP(此例中為IP-1)，爾後再依取得的SIP伺服器之IP送出SIP訊息。

們設法找出最壞的平均的探測等待時間，並設置它作為探測的週期。讓我們假設每個 SIP
探測封包的 TTL 是 u，即每個 SIP 探測封包確立每個被探測 SIP 伺服器是否正常運作應該
在 u 之內，因為取得探測封包回應的往返時間不應該超出 u。換言之、每個 SIP 探測封包的
最壞等待時間應以 u 為上界。 所以，如果有 n 個 SIP 伺服器在服務群中，最壞的平均探針
等待時間是(1+n)u/2。隨著服務群中的 SIP 伺服器數量增加，平均探針等待時間將會增加，
例如，當 u=150ms 時，最壞的平均探測封包等待時間隨伺服器數量增加而增加之結果，可

can be developed on Linux Virtual Server (LVS) [7]. However,
both approaches may consume more process time for the
traversing SIP messages through the intermediate node.
On the other hand, to save the implementation cost, the
VoIP service improved by having more backup nodes in a
collaborative Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network has been proposed
[8],[9]. In the P2P overlay network, each user plays as a server
as well as a client and has no centralized manager. However,
how to find a SIP server efficiently and quickly under such an
unstructured environment is a critical issue since the voice
communication is time-sensitive. Furthermore, the SIP
messages may be maliciously altered by any peer in the P2P
network and some independent peers may be reluctant to offer
services in such an unorganized circumstance. Hence, it needs
an additional faultless mechanism to improve.
In this article, we propose a probing-based name resolution
scheme to achieve high availability and load balance for the
SIP-based VoIP service. We tag the probing mechanism onto
the open source project Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD)
[10] to become a domain name resolution based load balancer
(DN-LB). By our scheme, SIP messages can be fairly
distributed to all failure-proof SIP proxy servers without the
necessity of building any additional costly intermediate node
and changing the existing SIP architecture. Therefore, DN-LB
can increase the reliability and fault tolerance for the SIP-
based VoIP service with a low cost.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the proposed scheme of how to fairly dispatch the
SIP loads to a set of SIP proxy servers with the assistance of
DN-LB. Such a scheme derived from the open project DNRD
with a probing-based name resolution avoids load bias.
Section 3 depicts the design and implementation of the
proposed scheme. We analyze the worst average probe waiting
time in our scheme to set the probing period in Section 4 and
make comparisons between our scheme and other possible
solutions in Section 5. Concluding remarks and future works
are finally drawn in Section 6.
2. Proposed scheme
A typical IP based application conducts a name resolution
for the server IP toward the domain name server (DNS) prior
to establishing an IP connection between the client and server.
The SIP-based VoIP service, which is an IP-based application,
has no exception. A SIP caller issues a SIP request message
toward the domain name of a pre-configured SIP proxy server.
Prior to sending out the message to the SIP proxy server, the
SIP client must implicitly conduct the domain name resolution
for the SIP proxy server by looking up the corresponding IP
toward the DNS. The concept we proposed is adding the
probing mechanism into the DNS to make the name resolution
featured by the proof of service. Such an improvement makes
DNS become not only an IP translator but a service checker.
A DNS variation, a domain name resolution based load
balancer (DN-LB), has been developed based on the open
source project Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD). With a
heart-beat probe feature, DN-LB periodically issues a dummy
SIP message packet to check the SIP service availability in the
backend SIP proxy server farm. DN-LB detects the health of
SIP proxy servers in a round-robin mode and always selects
the IP of the failure-proof and least-recently-set SIP proxy
server as the on-duty IP in the DNRD configuration file. By
intercepting the prerequisite name resolution process, such a
scheme can dispatch the service load to the SIP proxy servers
and find one suitable SIP proxy server to address the clients’ 
requests. The derived SIP-serving architecture shown in Fig. 2
mainly comprises one domain name resolution based load
balancer (DN-LB), a SIP proxy server farm containing a set of
SIP proxy servers and a common SIP service database which
maintains all service states.
A common interaction flow between the SIP client (SIP
caller) and main components in the architecture is illustrated
in [A]-[H].
[A] DN-LB utilizes the heart-beat probe mechanism to
check the SIP service availability in the SIP proxy
server farm by periodically issuing a dummy SIP
message packet to challenge the SIP proxy servers
and then determines the health status by the
corresponding response. Accordingly, the probed
server may either echo a response before timeout or
no response until timeout to reflect its status. The
probing mechanism checks the health of SIP proxy
servers in a round-robin mode and always selects the
IP of the failure-proof and least-recently-set SIP
proxy server as the on-duty IP in the DNRD
configuration file. In Fig. 2, after probing, the DN-LB
sets the 1st host’s IP (with an IP: IP-1) as the on-duty
SIP proxy server’s IP if the 1st host has a positive
acknowledge back to the DN-LB.
[B][C]
Figure 2: The Proposed SIP-serving Architecture
[B] All SIP clients are set the IP of DN-LB as their DNS.
Prior to sending out the message to the SIP proxy
server from the caller, the SIP client must conduct a
domain name resolution for the SIP proxy server by
looking up in DN-LB. We also set the TTL (Time-to-
Live) for the entry as the probing duration to force
the record validity expired in the local cache.
[C] Upon the DNS lookup request from the caller, DN-
LB responses the IP of the validated SIP proxy server
to the SIP caller. Similarly, before the next probe is
311
Figure 4: The Worst Average Probe Waiting Time (u=150ms)
On the other hand, as the server amount in the server farm
increases, the service’s failure rate exponentially decreases as
Fig. 5 shows when the failure rate for each server is 0.05.
Figure 5: The Service’s Failure Rate (p=0.05 per server)
5. Comparisons
5.1 Comparison between different solutions
The comparison between different solutions to raise the
VoIP service reliability is illustrated in Table 1. The proposed
architecture - DN-LB is equipped with a SIP proxy server
farm for backing up SIP service. Under a reasonable
determination time, DN-LB is capable of checking the service
availability to find a failure-proof server from the SIP proxy
server farm for duty. Furthermore, DN-LB selects the SIP
proxy server fairly by a controllable scheme to achieve load
balance among all backend SIP proxy servers. Besides, the
total cost of the implementation is comparatively economical
since it is not necessary to exploit any expensive equipment
for DN-LB.
Table 1 Comparison of Different Solutions
5.2 Comparison of client- side based probing and
DN-LB based probing
Another comparative viewpoint is who can be the better
probe issuer. The intuitive way to probe the service
availability is at the client side. However, it would lead to
flood lots of probe messages from all distributed clients in the
network. In addition, such an alternative needs to modify a
standard SIP client. It is difficult to deploy once the probing
rule is changed. On the other hand, the result of selecting the
on-duty SIP server in the server farm may be bias and cannot
achieve load balance among all backend SIP servers. The
comparison of issuing probe messages from the client side and
the DN-LB site is listed in Table 2.
Table 2 Comparison of issuing probe message from different
sides
6. Conclusion
As the Internet environment goes mature, the voice over IP
has a qualitative change from a research oriented topic to a
household service over Internet. VoIP may replace the
traditional voice over PSTN service in the future. Therefore,
the service availability for the VoIP on a best-effort network is
highly demanded. In the past, there are lots of approaches
proposed to raise the reliability of the VoIP service, such as
equipping redundant VoIP hosts to take over jobs when the
working server fails, using peers in a P2P network to offer a
complementary VoIP service, or exploiting an independent
layer-4 switch to become a load dispatcher. However, these
methods may increase the implementation cost or incur a more
complicated problem for the VoIP service. To relieve the side
effect in the mentioned problems, a probing-based scheme for
the reliable VoIP service has been proposed in this article. By
intercepting the prerequisite name resolution process in a
typical client-server application on the IP network, we tag the
probing mechanism onto the open source project Domain
Name Relay Daemon (DNRD) to become a domain name
resolution based load balancer (DN-LB). DN-LB can help find
a failure-proof server to address the requests from the VoIP
clients and dispatch the load to all normal servers in the server
farm. Without building any additional costly intermediate
node and changing the existing SIP architecture, DN-LB can
increase the reliability and fault tolerance for the VoIP service
with a low cost. Our future work is to take the round-trip-time
(RTT) for the probe message and the server load (LOAD) for
each server into consideration while selecting an on-duty host.
