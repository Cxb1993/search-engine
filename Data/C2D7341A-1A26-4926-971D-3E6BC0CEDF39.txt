With technology scaling down to deep sub-100 nm regime, leakage, variation and long-term degradation 
have surfaced to constrain the stability, scalability and attainable performance of CMOS SRAM.  
State-of-the-art processor cache memory and SoC embedded memory require large capacity SRAM with over  
+/-5σ design, and the ability to measure/characterize the Static Noise Margin (SNM) based on specific cell 
test structures and/or product level SRAM array has become ever-increasingly important.  Meanwhile, the 
lifetime reliability of nanoscale CMOS SRAM suffers from long term degradation such as Hot Carrier 
Injection (HCI), Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI, for pMOS), Poasitive Bias Temperature 
Instability (PBTI, for high- κ metal-gate nMOS), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), 
radiation-induced damage, etc.. In particular, NBTI/PBTI cause the threshold voltage, VT, to drift over the life 
span of usage, thus severely degrading the stability, margin, performance, and lifetime reliability. As such, 
SRAM NBTI/PBTI measurement structures, which allow designers to apply relevant stresses and characterize 
resulting stability degradation, have become a key research subject.  
 
 In this 2 year project, jointly with Faraday Technology Corporation (智原科技), we will develop 
measurement and characterization structures for Static Noise Margin and NBTI/PBTI for nanoscale CMOS 
SRAM. Both individual cell based structures (e.g. ring oscillator) and product array level techniques will be 
investigated. We will then apply the structures and measuring techniques to the characterization of SRAM 
stability and NBTI degradation (for poly-gate technology). Further, we will develop array-level measurement 
techniques to observe the characteristics of cells in SRAM cell array, and develop the architecture for 
measuring the Static Noise Margin (SNM) to provide designer with more direct and significant information 
about the SRAM stability and design margin.  Finally, we will build up a bridge between the measurement of 
NBTI and PBTI degradation and the resulting impact on SRAM

difference between the two ring oscillators is introduced by tapping logic [12] or a phase shifter [13]. As the 
“Beat Frequency” depends on the signal edge alignment of the two ring oscillators, a small drift of the 
frequency (hence the signal phase) of the “stressed” ring oscillator results in a large change in the “Beat 
Frequency”, thus significantly enhancing the sensitivity. To separate the NBTI and PBTI effects, improved 
“Cut-and-Bias” ring oscillator circuit with the flexibility of isolated or combined NBTI and PBTI 
measurement has been developed [14]. 
 
While individual cell/device based characterization structures can offer detail characteristics of the 
individual subjects, it is preferable and essential to characterize the Static Noise Margin and NBTI/PBTI 
degradation in product array like environment so as to capture all the lithography and process related effects.  
To accurately characterize the unstressed and stressed SRAM devices, it is necessary to place the devices as 
densely packed as they are in the normal SRAM array.  It is also important that the layout around the 
measured device is as close as possible to the layout of the original SRAM array to incorporate all the effects 
of the dense layout and the applied ground rule waivers not present in isolated single transistors [15]. This 
kind of scheme allows gathering of data of important cell device characteristics in a “real” “product-like” 
environment. 
 
 With modified SRAM column architecture which allows external access to individual bit-line and/or 
word-line, one can gather information on Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM) and Write Margin (WM) by 
measuring bit-line current under various voltage sweep [16, 17, 18]. This kind of scheme maintains the 
SRAM cell layout in “real” product, with changes only in the peripheral logic to allow external access to 
Word-Line (WL) and Bit-Line for voltage sweep and current measurement.

3.  An All-Digital Bit Transistor Characterization Scheme for CMOS 6T SRAM Array 
 
We have developed an all-digital bit transistor characterization scheme for CMOS 6T SRAM array. The 
scheme employs an on-chip operational amplifier feedback loop to measure the individual threshold 
voltage (VTH) of 6T SRAM bit cell transistors (holding PMOS, pull-down NMOS, and access NMOS) in 
SRAM cell array environment. The measured voltage is converted to frequency with dual VCO and 
counter based digital read-out to facilitate data extraction, processing, and statistical analysis. A 512Kb 
test chip is implemented in 55nm 1P10M Standard Performance (SP) CMOS technology. Monte Carlo 
simulations indicate that the accuracy of the VTH measurement scheme is about 2-7mV at TT corner 
across temperature range from 85oC to -45oC, and post-layout simulations show the resolution of the 
digital read-out scheme is < 0.2mV per bit. Measured VTH distributions agree well with Monte Carlo 
simulation results. The results have been presented in a conference paper at 2012 IEEE International 
Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS).

Together with our former colleagues in the High-κ Metal-Gate Group and SRAM and 
Technology-Circuit Co-Design members in VLSI Design Department at IBM T. J. Watson Research 
Center, and Georgia Tech., we have developed Ring Oscillator Monitoring Structures for 
isolated/combined NBTI and PBTI Measurement.  The monitoring structures have been implemented in 
high-k metal-gate technology.  The measurement results clearly show significant RO frequency 
degradation from PBTI as well as NBTI.  For comparison, RO structures with the same principle are 
also implemented in a SiO2/poly-gate technology, where PBTI is negligible. Experimental results show 
noticeable frequency degradation under NBTI-only stress mode but negligible degradation under 
PBTI-only mode, which illustrates the validity of the proposed principle and structures. The results have

Lake City, UT, U.S.A., we have developed a Slew-Rate Monitoring circuit for on-chip process variation 
detection. The difference of rise and fall slew is presented as another process-variation metric along with 
the delay in determining the relative mismatch between the drive strengths of nMOS and pMOS devices. 
The importance of considering both of these metrics is illustrated, and a new slew rate monitoring circuit 
is presented for measuring the difference of rise and fall slew of a signal on the critical path of a circuit. 
Sensitivity analysis with multiple pulses as input has also been investigated. Bias generator circuits that 
track nMOS and pMOS threshold voltages have been incorporated, which makes the design less 
susceptible to process variation. Design considerations, simulation results, and characteristics of the 
slew-rate monitor circuitry in a 65-nm IBM CMOS process are presented, and a  sensitivity of 50

Abstract—One of the major reliability concerns in nano-scale 
CMOS VLSI design is the time-dependent Bias Temperature 
Instability (BTI) degradation. Negative Bias Temperature 
Instability and Positive Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI and 
PBTI) weaken MOSFETs over usage/stress time. We present an 
embedded 6T SRAM ring oscillator structure which provides in-
situ measurement/characterization capability of cell transistor 
degradation induced by bias temperature instability. The 
viability of the embedded ring oscillator odometer and the 
impact of bias temperature instability are demonstrated in 55nm 
standard performance CMOS technology. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Lifetime reliability is one of the key design factors for 
robust VLSI systems. Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot 
Carrier Injection (HCI), and Time Dependent Dielectric 
Breakdown (TDDB) have become major concerns for 
performance and yield of nano-scale CMOS VLSI systems. 
These reliability degradations not only constrain the 
technology scaling, but also threaten the stability and 
functionality of digital circuits [1-4]. The degradation of 
device threshold voltage under the presence of electrical and 
thermal stress has long been a significant reliability issue in 
scaled CMOS technologies. Due to the importance of long-
term degradation in nano-scale CMOS SRAM, there have 
been significant amount of efforts investigating the impacts of 
NBTI and PBTI on SRAM static/dynamic noise margins and 
cell failure probability [1, 2]. Kang et al. [2] explored the 
impact of NBTI degradation of several critical performance 
parameters of SRAM arrays. They showed that, under NBTI 
stress, the Static Noise Margin (SNM), READ stability, and 
parametric yield of SRAM array were severely degraded over 
time. On the other hand, Write-ability and leakage current 
might improve with time. Bansal et al. [3] carried out failure 
analysis using Monte-Carlo simulations and showed that, 
under worst-case static stress, NBTI and PBTI degraded the 
stability during READ (significantly) and WRITE (marginally) 
operations. 
Ring Oscillator (RO) based structure for measuring NBTI 
degradation is the simplest method [5]. It has been shown that 
the relative degradation of NBTI stressed ring oscillator 
increases as the operating voltage decreases. Some on-chip 
reliability monitors for measuring degradation of digital 
circuits have been proposed [5-7].The circuits in [5] overcome 
the drawbacks of conventional ring oscillators which fail to 
isolate the NBTI and PBTI contribution when PBTI isn’t 
negligible anymore in deeply-scaled CMOS technology with 
high-K/metal-gate [8, 9]. Kim et al. [6] developed a silicon 
odometer with high sensing resolution by measuring the beat 
frequency of two ring oscillators. Furthermore, a monitoring 
structure [7], which can measure the frequency degradation 
induced by HCI, BTI, and TDDB separately, has been 
introduced for accurate real-time reliability monitoring.  
However, all of these monitoring structures were implemented 
in logic circuits with individual isolated logic devices to 
characterize the BTI effects on general digital logic 
devices/circuits, not for specific SRAM cell transistors in a 
real SRAM cell array environment. 
In this work, we propose an embedded SRAM ring 
oscillator structure and measurement technique to characterize 
the BTI degradation of 6T SRAM cell transistors in a real 
SRAM cell array environment. The embedded ring oscillators 
are built using the 6T SRAM cell transistors directly in a real 
SRAM cell array environment, thus providing direct 
correlation between measured BTI degradation of cell 
transistors and the resulting impacts on SRAM stability. The 
details of the Embedded SRAM Ring Oscillator (ESRO) are 
presented in Section II. The analysis and measurement results 
are shown in Section III, and the conclusions of the paper are 
given in Section IV. 
II. EMBEDDED SRAM RING OSCILLATOR 
A.  Embedded SRAM Ring Oscillator and BTI Stress 
Fig. 1 shows a PMOS (NMOS) under NBTI (PBTI) stress, As 
mentioned above, the SRAM stability degradation induced by 
BTI significantly impacts the long-term reliability. As such, it 
is crucial to have a characterization structure that can provide 
direct measurement of cell transistor degradation due to aging 
effects. We modify the SRAM cell array to form an ESRO for 
BTI measurement. We combine the BTI stress capability and 
ring oscillator into ESRO structure. In 6T SRAM cell (Fig. 2), 
we are mainly concerned about the degradation of pull-up 
PMOS (NBTI) and pull-down NMOS (PBTI). The 
degradation of these two devices can affect the cell stability 
and performance significantly. For the access pass-gate 
transistor, the active period for a particular WL is typically 
relatively short during the whole SRAM operation.

near the ring oscillator array. The dummy cells (CNn (n=0, 25, 
50, 75)) used in 100-stage ring array are for passing signals 
and to preserve the SRAM cell array layout characteristics in 
each stage of ESRO. The delay time of entire ESRO is 34.5ns. 
Fig. 7 shows the simulated results of frequency degradation 
versus threshold voltage drift using modified cell device 
models. Based on 55nm 1P9M 1.0V SiO2/poly-gate standard 
performance CMOS process, the oscillation frequency of 
ESRO is 14.5 MHz and the area of the two parallel 100 stages 
ESROs is 546.7 m2 (66.67m*8.2m), including the dummy 
cells for preserving the layout characteristics of SRAM cell 
array. 
C. Counter-Based Measurement Circuit 
Since the threshold voltage of MOSFET is an analog signal, 
it is difficult to extract large amount of data for SRAMs in 
SOCs. Hence, in this work, we use a full digital scheme to 
convert the threshold voltage drift to frequency difference to 
facilitate data extraction, processing, and statistical analysis. A 
basic set of measurement unit (Fig. 8) consists of two ring 
oscillators and a frequency comparator [10]. The output of the 
comparator, FFCOUT, is the “Beat Frequency” (frequency 
difference between the stressed ring oscillator and the 
unstressed ring oscillator). The final stage of ESROs, the 101-
stage enabling NAND gate, is placed in the frequency 
comparator block. A counter-based digital read-out scheme is 
used to convert the beat frequency to digital output. The 
detailed structure is shown in Fig. 9. With this scheme, we can 
extract the beat frequency quickly with high resolution. 
As shown in Fig. 9, for NBTI in PMOS, the beat 
frequency FFCOUT ranges roughly from 50 KHz to 760 KHz. 
Due to wide frequency range of FFCOUT, the counter B (16-bit) 
should have the ability to cover the lowest and the highest 
frequency of FFCOUT so that it won’t overflow in the counting 
period,   which is decide by counter A (10-bit).  The extracted 
digital data can be easily converted back to threshold voltage 
drift with a conversion table for statistical analysis. 
One SRAM Ring Oscillator bank includes 8 sets of 
measurement unit. The core part of the measurement circuit  
(Fig. 9) comprises of 64 SRAM Ring Oscillator banks and 
some peripheral circuits, such as decoder, global MUX, and 
buffer. The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 10. The

Abstract—We present an all-digital Read Stability and Write 
Margin (WM) characterization scheme for CMOS 6T SRAM 
array. The scheme measures the cell Read Disturb voltage (Vread) 
and cell Inverter Trip voltage (Vtrip) in SRAM cell array 
environment.  Measured voltages are converted to frequency with 
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and counter based digital 
read-out to facilitate data extraction, processing, and statistical 
analysis.  Resistor based voltage divider with 64 voltage levels and 
10mV per step is employed to allow sweeping of BL voltage from 
640mV to GND for WM characterization.  A 512Kb test macro is 
implemented in UMC 55nm 1P10M Standard Performance (SP) 
CMOS technology. Monte Carlo simulations validate the 
accuracy of Vread and Vtrip measurement scheme, and post-layout 
simulations show the resolution of the digital read-out scheme is  
0.167mV/bit.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The cell stability, Static Noise Margin (SNM) [1], and VMIN
 
of CMOS 6T SRAM are limited by leakage, variation, and 
supply voltage in the physical domain [2-7], and conflicting 
Read/Write requirements and cell disturb in the design domain. 
With technology scaling, the variations in cell Read-Disturb 
voltage (Vread) (Fig. 1) and cell Inverter Trip voltage (Vtrip) 
increase, causing overlap and Read failure [8]. Various 
measurement techniques have been developed to characterize 
SRAM bit cell transistors, Read Stability and Write Margin 
(WM) [9]. While individual cell/device based characterization 
structures [10] can offer detail characteristics of the individual 
subjects, it is preferable and essential to characterize the Read 
Stability and WM in product array like environment so as to 
capture all the lithography and process related effects [11-14]. 
It is also important that the layout surrounding measured 
devices is as close as possible to the layout of the original 
SRAM array to incorporate the effects of dense layout and the 
applied ground rule waivers not present in isolated single 
transistor or cell. 
In this work, we present an all-digital Read Stability and 
Write Margin (WM) characterization scheme for CMOS 6T 
SRAM array. The scheme measures the cell Read Disturb 
voltage (Vread) and cell Inverter Trip voltage (Vtrip) in SRAM 
cell array environment.  Measured voltages are converted to 
frequency with Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and 
counter based digital read-out to facilitate data extraction, 
processing, and statistical analysis. Resistor based voltage 
divider with 64 voltage levels is employed to allow sweeping of 
BL voltage for WM characterization. Section II describes the 
modified cell structure, measurement scheme and Monte Carlo 
simulation results to validate the measurement scheme. Section 
III presents the test macro architecture and digital read-out 
scheme. Section IV discusses the 512Kb test macro 
implementation in UMC 55nm CMOS technology. The 
conclusions of the paper are given in Section V.

II. MEASUREMENT SCHEMES FOR VREAD, VTRIP AND WM 
 
A. Modified  Cells  for Vread  and  Vtrip 
 
Fig.  2 and Fig. 3 depict the schematic, modification of the 
cell layout and the equivalent circuit for Vread and Vtrip 
measurement, respectively.  For 6T SRAM, thin cell layout 
with horizontal uni-directional poly, and pattern 
density/symmetry are crucial for manufacturability and yield, 
especially for poly, diffusion and contact layers. To blank out 
unused cell devices and alter connections while preserving the 
layout and surroundings of critical layers, we keep the diffusion, 
poly and contact layers intact, and only modify Via and metal 
layers as shown in Fig. 2(b) and 3(b).  
To measure Vread, the left cell inverter is blanked out with its 
supply and GND nodes left floating.  The input of the right cell 
inverter (gate of M1/M2) is connected to VDD to force the right 
cell storage node Q to “Low”, corresponding to the condition 
for Read operation. The column structure for Vread 
measurement is shown in Fig. 4(a). In Vread measurement mode, 
“Vread_enb” goes “Low”, and the Read conditioning PMOS 
precharges and holds BL at VDD. The voltage at node Q, 
resulting from the voltage divider effect from right access 
transistor M3 and right pull-down NMOS M2, will be Vread, and 
is passed through the left access transistor M6 to BLB for 
measurement.  
For Vtrip measurement , the left cell inverter is blanked out 
with its supply and GND nodes left floating. In Vtrip 
measurement mode, “Vtrip_enb” (Fig. 4(b)) goes “Low”, The Trip 
conditioning PMOS equalizes (i.e. shorts) the voltages of BL 
and BLB, which in term forces the input and output of the right 
cell inverter (M1/M2 in Fig. 3) to equal potential at Vtrip.

III. TEST CHIP ARCHITECTURE AND DIGITAL READ-OUT SCHEME 
 
Fig. 6 shows the measurement array architecture. To reduce 
pin count for the control signals and input address, shift 
registers are employed for both row and column decoders. The 
columns for Vread, Vtrip, and WM measurement are interleaved 
with independent set of column shift registers. For WM 
measurement, it is necessary to stay at the same selected WL 
through Write (WM Measurement)-Read (Verify whether 
Write is successful)-Write (Write original data back into 
selected cells) sequence while sweeping through the BL 
voltage step. Two types of shift registers are employed: the 
column shift register (Fig. 7(a)) for normal sequential shift and 
the row shift register (Fig. 7(b)) with the added capability of 
holding the previous data (for staying at the same WL for WM 
measurement). To prevent the voltage level degradation 
through the column mux, full transmission gate with high gate 
control voltage of 1.2V is use. The rest of the design including 
supply for cell array operates at 1.0V.

The bit-line length is 128 cells. Each bank comprises 128 
WL and 85 sets of interleaved Vread, Vtrip and WM columns (a 
total of 3ͪ85 columns). So there are about 128ͪ85ͪ3~32K cells 
in a bank. With 16 banks, the total cell number is 16ͪ32K ~ 
512Kb. For each Vread, Vtrip or WM measurement, we can 
obtain 128ͪ85ͪ16=174.08K samples.

To facilitate extraction, processing, and statistical analysis of 
large amount of data, a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) 
and counter based digital read-out scheme (Fig. 8 and  9) 
similar to that in [15] is employed. The measured analog 
voltage is fed into an unity-gain buffer, converted into 
frequency by VCO, divided through a 10-bit Frequency Divider 
(FD) and read-out by the counter. Reference and calibration 
paths are provided.  Since the voltage levels of measured Vread 
and Vtrip are low ( < 1/2 VDD),  P-type VCO with PMOS delay 
control device  (Fig. 8(b)) is employed so the measured analog 
voltage (the control voltage at the gate of PMOS delay control 
device) is at where the VCO sensitivity is maximum. This 
provides a sensitivity of about  480MHz/V (Fig. 10) for the 
VCO. The resolution of the counter depends on number of bits 
and the period of counting. The 13-bit counter in the Reference 
path is used to set the counting period of the 14-bit counter in 
the measurement path which does the actual counting. This 
provides a resolution of about 0.167mV/bit.

Abstract—We present an all-digital bit transistor 
characterization scheme for CMOS 6T SRAM array. The 
scheme employs an on-chip operational amplifier feedback loop 
to measure the individual threshold voltage (VTH) of 6T SRAM 
bit cell transistors (holding PMOS, pull-down NMOS, and 
access NMOS) in SRAM cell array environment. The measured 
voltage is converted to frequency with dual VCO and counter 
based digital read-out to facilitate data extraction, processing, 
and statistical analysis. A 512Kb test chip is implemented in 
55nm 1P10M Standard Performance (SP) CMOS technology. 
Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the accuracy of the VTH 
measurement scheme is about 2-7mV at TT corner across 
temperature range from 85oC to -45oC, and post-layout 
simulations show the resolution of the digital read-out scheme is 
< 0.2mV per bit.  Measured VTH distributions agree well with 
Monte Carlo simulation results. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
With technology scaling down to deep sub-100 nm regime, 
leakage, variation and long-term degradation have surfaced to 
constrain the stability, scalability and attainable performance 
of CMOS SRAM [1]. The rapid increase in local random VTH 
variation, against the backdrop of lower supply voltage and 
increasing memory capacity in state-of-the-art processors and 
SoC, has become the major challenge in the design of 6T 
SRAMs. Various measurement techniques have been 
developed to characterize the VTH fluctuation of logic devices 
[2-5] and SRAM bit cell transistors [6-8]. While isolated 
device/cell based characterization structures can offer detail 
characteristics of the individual subject, it is preferable and 
essential to characterize the VTH variation in product array like 
environment to capture the lithography and process related 
effects. It is important to maintain the dense layout and 
surroundings of the measured devices as close as possible to 
the original SRAM array to incorporate the layout dependent 
effects and applied ground rule waivers not present in 
insolated single transistor. Various array based techniques for 
characterizing bit cell transistors and/or cell 
stability/degradation have been developed [7-12]. These array 
based techniques typically modify the SRAM cell layout to 
gain access to (or “expose”) the individual cell transistors for 
ID and VTH measurement in standard array topology without 
changing the cell layout considerably [8], or modify the 
SRAM column architecture to allow external access to each 
and every bit-line for gathering information on ID and VTH [7], 
Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM) and Write Margin (WM) 
by measuring bit-line current under various voltage sweeps [9, 
10].  It is also highly desirable to have digital read-out scheme
 to facilitate fast collection, extraction, processing, and 
statistical analysis of large amount of data [5, 12].

In this work, we present an all-digital bit transistor 
characterization scheme for CMOS 6T SRAM array. The 
scheme employs an on-chip operational amplifier feedback 
loop to measure the individual threshold voltage of 6T SRAM 
bit cell transistors (holding PMOS, pull-down NMOS, and 
access NMOS) (Fig. 1) in SRAM cell array environment. The 
measured voltage is converted to frequency with dual-VCO 
and counter-based digital read-out to facilitate data extraction,

The conclusions of the paper are given in Section VII. 
II. MEASUREMENT SCHEME AND MODIFIED CELL STRUCTURE 
Fig. 2 depicts the basic Operational Amplifier (OP-Amp) 
based VTH measurement scheme in [2, 3], where the Device 
Under Test (DUT) is an NMOS (Fig. 2(a)) and a PMOS (Fig. 
2(b)). In this scheme, the source voltage of DUT (Vsource) 
follows Vset, and together with Rload, determines the current 
through DUT. The Vset and Rload are chosen such that the 
current density through DUT is where the VTH is defined (and 
to be measured). As such, the gate voltage of DUT, Vgate, is 
one ｜VTH｜ above (below) Vsource for NMOS (PMOS), and 
measurement of Vgate provides direct information of VTH 
(Vgate = Vset ± ︱VTH︱ ). This scheme has been used to 
characterize VTH variations of an addressable array of 65nm 
PD/SOI logic transistors [2, 3].

The 512Kb test chip comprises eight 64Kb banks. The 
organization of a 64Kb bank is shown in Fig. 6, together with 
the Word-Line (Row) selection circuit and Rload switching 
circuit.  The Rload switching circuit consists of 3 resistors, with 
resistance values optimized for PUL/PDL/PGL mode, 
respectively.  The mode switch employs stacked switching 
transistors to ensure that the leakage through the unselected 
paths (modes) is suppressed well below the  selected one 
(whose current is set at where VTH is defined).

V. DIGITAL READ-OUT SCHEME 
To facilitate extraction, processing, and statistical analysis 
of large amount of data, a VCO (Voltage Controlled 
Oscillator) and counter based digital read-out scheme (Fig. 7) 
similar to that in [5] is employed. The measured analog 
voltage is fed into an unity-gain buffer, converted into 
frequency by VCO, and read-out by the counter. Reference 
and calibration paths are provided. Since both NMOS 
(PDL/PGL) and PMOS (PUL) are measured, the output from 
the measurement scheme in Fig. 3 has distinctly different 
voltage level for each mode and varies significantly across 
process and temperature corners.  As such, two types of VCO 
are designed to provide maximum sensitivity for each mode 
and corner.  The VCO has 30 stages. For the N-type VCO 
(Fig. 8(a)), when the control voltage (Vctrl) rises, the VCO 
frequency increases (Fig. 9(a)). The P-type VCO (Fig. 8(b) 
and 9(b)) operates in complementary manner.  The dual VCO 
design allows us to place the measured analog voltages 
(which are buffered then fed to Vctrl ) at where the VCO 
sensitivity (slopes of curves in Fig. 9) is maximum.  Post-
simulations based on 55nm Standard Performance CMOS 
technology show that we can achieve about 265MHz/mV for 
N-type VCO and 350MHz/mV for P-type VCO.

(PDL/PGL) and PMOS (PUL) are measured, the output from 
the measurement scheme in Fig. 3 has distinctly different 
voltage level for each mode and varies significantly across 
process and temperature corners.  As such, two types of VCO 
are designed to provide maximum sensitivity for each mode 
and corner.  The VCO has 30 stages. For the N-type VCO 
(Fig. 8(a)), when the control voltage (Vctrl) rises, the VCO 
frequency increases (Fig. 9(a)). The P-type VCO (Fig. 8(b) 
and 9(b)) operates in complementary manner.  The dual VCO 
design allows us to place the measured analog voltages 
(which are buffered then fed to Vctrl ) at where the VCO 
sensitivity (slopes of curves in Fig. 9) is maximum.  Post-
simulations based on 55nm Standard Performance CMOS 
technology show that we can achieve about 265MHz/mV for 
N-type VCO and 350MHz/mV for P-type VCO.

The resolution of the counter depends on number of bits and 
the period of counting. The 13-bit counter in the Reference 
path is used to set the counting period of the 14-bit counter 
which does the actual counting. This provides a resolution of 
about 0.125mV (0.12mV) per bit when N-type (P-type) VCO
