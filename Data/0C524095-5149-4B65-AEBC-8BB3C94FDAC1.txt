DPE-controlled radical polymerizations in homogeneous and miniemulsion systems 
at 80oC20, and concluded that polymerization carried out in miniemulsion system 
exhibited higher reaction rate and better controlled living character than those in 
homogeneous system. Nevertheless, according to the published papers, constant 
molecular weight of polymer throughout the reaction was still unanswered1, 21. 
Therefore, some kinetic studies have been carried on in our group and the rate 
constants involved in the DPE-PMMA mechanisms were estimated22. The rate 
constant k2, corresponding to the reactivation of the DPE capped dormant chains was 
found to be very small at 80oC (1×10-5 s-1), which successfully accounted for the 
constant molecular weight of polymers throughout the DPE controlled radical 
polymerizations. 
The controlled ability of DPE system could be improved at elevated 
temperatures with more activation-deactivation cycles, but it was not good enough in 
narrowing the PDI compared to the well known CRP methods mentioned before. In 
those CRP processes, for example, NMP and ATRP, activation/deactivation cycles 
are fast enough to narrow down the molecular weight distribution. Therefore, two step 
polymerizations with preheating treatment in such cases are less important. However 
in DPE mediated radical polymerizations, the rate constant of k2 is much smaller than 
k1, thus the activation/deactivation cycles are very slow and it is difficult to obtain a 
narrow molecular weight distribution without preheating treatment. Although some 
well defined multi block copolymers and graft copolymers were synthesized 
successfully by DPE method 23-27, there have been a very limited number of 
publications on DPE as a mediator for controlled radical polymerizations and the 
deficiencies of DPE-controlled system such as large polydispersity index, undesired 
chain terminations, and no expected molecular weight growing were still unsolved up 
 6 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials 
Methyl methacrylate (MMA; Acros), styrene (ST; Acros), and 1,1-diphenylethene 
(DPE; Acros) were distilled under a reduced pressure and stored at 5°C before use. 
2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN; Showa) was recrystallized from methanol. 
Tetrahydrofuran (ECHO), methanol (ECHO), and hydroquinone (HQ, Acros) were 
used without further purification.  
Bulk Polymerization 
Monomers, initiator AIBN and control agent DPE following the molar ratios in Table 
1&2 were mixed in a 100ml sealed three-necked glass reactor in one step or two steps. 
Nitrogen was purged for half an hour to drive out the oxygen and moisture before the 
reaction. Then the glass bottle was immersed in an oil bath to start the polymerization. 
Temperature of the reaction mixture was monitored by thermal couple. In the two-
step process, the initiator was dissolved in a small amount of monomer in the 
presence of DPE, and was preheated for a specific period of time in the first step. 
Various time periods were chosen, basically depending on the dissociation rate of the 
initiator and polymerization rate. In the second step, the remaining monomers were 
then purged into the reaction bottle to continue the living polymerization. Certain 
amount of the sample was taken out into hydroquinone-containing methanol solution 
to precipitate polymers for the measurements of molecular weights and conversions. 
Characterization 
The conversion of monomer during polymerization was determined by gravimetric 
method. Molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of synthesized polymers 
at different conversions were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 
 8 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Reaction temperatures and polymerization without preheating treatment 
In sample A0, the reaction temperature was kept at 80oC and its GPC diagram 
was shown in Figure 1. Results showed that the number average molecular weight 
stayed constant throughout the reaction with consumption of the monomer and narrow 
PDI (1.2~1.3) was obtained in a small Mn range. It revealed that DPE capped on the 
polymer chains which were generated from continuously dissociated initiator and 
were unable to reactivate owing to the extremely small k222, so that diversity of the 
molecular weights was not obvious. Livingness of this trial was also verified by a 
chain extension experiment22. Typically this case does not belong to the categories of 
CRP and shows no real features of controllable molecular weight growing. Scheme 1 
shows the DPE mechanism. Pn-D* and P2t were suggested to be the dormant 
structures of DPE ended radicals. For the sake of more activation-deactivation cycles 
between Pn* and Pn-D*, we conducted the polymerizations at higher temperatures and 
the corresponding samples were A1, B1, and B1-1. When the temperature was raised 
above 90 oC, consecutive molecular weight growing due to an elevated k2 was 
observed from GPC diagram. However, both of the continuous generation of 
relatively small molecular weight polymer chains caused by the dissociation of 
initiator and chain terminations enlarged the PDI values throughout the reaction. In 
styrene systems, sample B1 has similar displays to sample A1 and sample B1-1 has 
bimodal molecular weight distributions over the course of polymerization on GPC 
traces. It was apparent that great differences between chain lengths were obtained 
under the conditions in the above mentioned samples. 
 
 10 
weight which was determined by the amount of monomer added, the propagation 
stopped. These phenomena were verified by the behavior of stagnant movement of 
peaks laid in the larger Mn zone on GPC diagram after certain extent of monomer 
consumption, and a smaller PDI value (1.45) was obtained at a “non viscous” 18% 
low monomer conversion when the propagations ended. Data indicated that at 80oC, 
the small reactivation constant k2 not only lessened the cycles between Pn* and Pn-D* 
but increased the PDI values throughout the course of polymerization.  
    To conduct the polymerizations at a higher temperature 95 oC with preheating 
treatment, such as sample A7, a continuous molecular weight growing with narrow 
distributions was observed throughout the course of polymerization. The GPC traces 
of A7 were shown in Figure 3. Details are discussed in the following section. 
 
Preparation of large molecular weight polymers with a narrow distribution 
(1) Influence of monomer concentration in the step of preheating treatment 
In samples A3 to A5, the first step of preheating treatment was conducted in 
various small amount of monomer at 95 oC with fixed molar ratio of DPE/AIBN and 
preheating time of 2 hours. The PDI values under given molecular weight were in an 
order of A3>A4, and A5>A4. The reason for A3>A4 was due to the increases of 
polymerization rate and chain length of DPE capped precursors in the step of 
preheating treatment in A3. The concentration of monomer was higher in A3, thus the 
polymerization rate increased and the chain length increased in the preheating 
treatment step. As the activation-deactivation cycles were not proceeded fast enough 
in the following second step living polymerization, the chain length of precursors 
would influence the PDI of the final product polymers. The increase of chain length 
 12 
monomer concentrations, to extend the preheating time led to a better living character. 
The PDI values of sample A7 stayed relatively small with the consumption of 
monomer even in the range of Mn~105g/mol. The molecular weight and PDI values 
verses conversion of samples A5~A7 were shown in Figure 5. Similar results between 
sample B3 and B4 in styrene system with different preheating times were shown in 
Figure 6. The order of molecular weights and PDI values at given conversion were 
B4(30mins)>B3(10mins) and B3>B4, respectively. 
     
(3) Influence of DPE  
The polymerization of sample A8 was carried out with less DPE than in sample 
A4. The molar ratio of MMA: AIBN was fixed, but the molar ratio of DPE: AIBN 
were 4:1 and 12:1 in A8 and A4, respectively. The Molecular weight and PDI verses 
conversion were shown in Figure 7. The results revealed that, as more DPE were 
employed into the system, the polymerization rates were retarded not only in the first 
step of reaction but also in the second step of living polymerizations. In other words, 
larger molecular weight of A8 in comparison with A4 under given monomer 
conversion was expected. As less DPE are present, the more probabilities for the 
decapping of Pn-D* and lower probabilities for Pn* to be capped again over the course 
of living polymerization, the propagation of polymer chains and thus the molecular 
weight of A8 increased significantly. 
    The trend of molecular weights and PDI values verses conversion in B2 and B3 
were shown in Figure 8, in which molar ratios of DPE: AIBN were 2:1 and 12:1, 
respectively. Results showed that, under low DPE concentration such as B2, the PDI 
values increased with the growing of molecular weight. However, controlled PDI 
 14 
CONCLUSIONS 
    In this study, the performance of DPE controlled radical polymerizations has shown 
to be improved substantially through a two-step polymerization process. More 
activation-deactivation cycles occurred at higher temperatures, which caused 
consecutive molecular weight growing during polymerization. It was found that a 
preheating treatment of initiators was necessary for a better living character of DPE 
controlled systems. In our experimental results, the PDI of final polymers decreased 
with lowering the amount of monomer concentrations in the preheating step. 
Furthermore, increasing the preheating time in monomer deficient conditions has led 
to an enhanced controlled living character. Also, the influences of amount of DPE on 
the reaction rate, molecular weights, and the trend of PDI values were investigated. 
Controllable chain extensions were achievable and smaller PDI values were obtained 
through this new approach.

Preparation of Novel Suspensions ZnO/Living Block Copolymer Latex 
Nanoparticles via Pickering Emulsion Polymerization and their Long Term 
Stability 
INTRODUCTION 
The emulsions solely stabilized by solid particles instead of surfactant molecules, 
so-called Pickering emulsions or solid-stabilized emulsions, have been proposed over 
a century.1,2 Relevant colloidal inorganic/organic composite substances are widely 
used in food, cosmetics, and the pharmaceutical industry. Self-assembled solid 
particles at the oil/water interface are partially wetted by both water and oil phase 
with high energies of attachment ?E = –piR2(1±cosθ)2γ compared with the thermal 
energies kT, so that the adsorptions can be regarded as irreversible.3,4 The negative 
sign in the bracket represents removal of the particle into the continuous phase 
whereas positive sign represents removal of the particle into the oil phase. Three-
phase contact angle with respect to the continuous phase,θ, is the main parameter in 
the design of Pickering emulsion, which determines the position of the solid particles 
in the oil/water interface and is equivalent to HLB for surfactants. Hydrophilic 
particles have a θ< 90 whereas hydrophobic particles have a θ> 90 . Firstly, it was 
believed that the coalescence of the droplets was suppressed due to the steric barrier 
composed by the coherent particle layer around,5-7 and various documents indicated 
that a good emulsion stabilization could be achieved with weak aggregation of the 
particles.8-10 Recent research has shown that well-separated particles are able to form 
stable emulsions even if the droplets are sparsely covered.11 Binks proposed two 
mechanisms of particle-stabilized emulsion and explained why strongly repulsive 
colloidal particles could act as a very effective emulsion stabilizer with dilute planer 
 32 
exciton binding energy (60meV), has been regarded as an advanced material due to its 
novel electronic and optical properties as well as applications in solar cell, gas sensor, 
acoustic, piezoelectric, and luminescent devices. The amphoteric property has also 
made ZnO as an excellent material for pH buffering. Various synthesis routes of ZnO 
such as sol-gel method, chemical vapor deposition, homogeneous precipitation, 
thermal decomposition, and hydrothermal method have been developed. Recently, we 
reported ZnO/Polystyrene composite particles via Pickering emulsion 
polymerization,46 and the unmodified ZnO nanoparticles showed a strong tendency of 
aggregation thus the obtained composite latexes were easily precipitated. Voorn et al 
prepared polymer-clay nanocomposite latex particles by inverse Pickering emulsion 
polymerization, and the obtained latex would sedimentate within a day.15 However, in 
most of the applications in colloidal organic/inorganic hybrid, long term stability is 
one of the crucial concerns so that a highly stable dispersion is required. In this work, 
a novel ZnO/PSS- nanocomposite suspension was synthesized by a facile 
hydrothermal method and served the stabilizer in Pickering emulsion. Living 
polymerizations was conducted in Pickering emulsion polymerization system, and 
ZnO/living block copolymer composite latex particles were firstly successfully 
prepared. Characterizations of ZnO/PSS- nanocomposite particles and their oil/water 
interfacial properties were discussed. The influences of hydrophilicity of the 
ZnO/PSS- nanocomposite as well as the ratio between ZnO/PSS- and oil phase on the 
polymerization, controlled living character, molecular weight (Mn), and molecular 
weight distribution (PDI) of living block copolymers throughout the Pickering 
emulsion polymerization has also been elaborated. To the best of our knowledge, this 
was the first solid stabilized emulsion with a controlled/living radical polymerization 
inside. 
 34 
particles of PMMA-b-PBA from miniemulsion polymerization were reported in our 
previous work.47 In Pickering emulsion polymerization, two parts of the solution were 
prepared before the emulsification. The aqueous phase composed of deionized water 
and ZnO/PSS- suspension, and the oil phase composed of DPE-capped PMMA 
macroinitiator, toluene, BA, and HD. Schematic diagram of the formation mechanism 
and detailed formulations were shown in Scheme 2 and Table 2, respectively. The two 
solutions were mixed and stirred for 30 min as pre-emulsification and followed with 
the ultrasonication in an ice bath using Hielscher UP-50H ultrasonicator (amplitude 
100%, 1hr). The ice bath was used in order to prevent polymerization during 
ultrasonication. Finally, the homogenized emulsion was poured into a 250ml four-
necked round bottle reactor equipped with a reflux condenser, a thermo couple, a 
stirrer, nitrogen inlet and outlet in an oil bath. The emulsion was purged by nitrogen 
for 30min followed by heating to a reaction temperature at 80oC. During 
polymerization, certain amount of the sample was taken out into hydroquinone-
containing methanol solution in the presence of several drops of hydrochloric acid to 
precipitate polymers for the measurements of molecular weights and conversions. The 
acid was used to demulsify the system via decomposing the ZnO/ PSS- 
nanocomposite particles. 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Experiments. FTIR analysis 
was recorded by Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer of the samples on thin 
transparent tablets ground with KBr. Spectra were collected through averaging 32 
scans and recorded in the interval between 400nm-1 to 4000nm-1. 
Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). TGA of the ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites was 
carried out using Perkin-Elmer 7. The temperature was kept at 100  for 10mins and 
heated to 800 oC with a heating of 10 oC /min under an air atmosphere. All 
 36 
  Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The morphologies and sizes of the 
latexes were also measured by using Hitachi H-7100 transmission electron 
microscope. The samples were prepared by evaporating dilute suspensions on a 
carbon-coated cooper grid. 
Interfacial tension measurements. Interfacial tension measurements were 
performed by a pendant drop of the aqueous ZnO/PSS- dispersion formed at the tip of 
a stainless steel capillary tube with an internal radius of 1.5mm in a glass cell 
containing toluene. Profiles of interfacial tension versus time were recorded by PAT-
2P Sinterface with an automatic feedback. Interfacial tension measurements on the 
pure water/toluene interface were checked before each experiment.  
Polymer Characterizations. The conversion of monomer during polymerization 
was determined by gravimetric method. Molecular weight and molecular weight 
distribution of synthesized polymers at different conversions were measured by gel 
permeation chromatography (GPC), which was equipped with a solvent delivery 
system, two columns (300×7.8 mm, 5 micron, phenomenex), and a differential 
refractometer (RI). Two columns were maintained at 40oC. THF was used as the 
eluent and kept at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The sample concentration for GPC 
measurements was 2mg/ml THF. Seven polystyrene standards with molecular weights 
ranging from 104g/mol to 382100 g/mol were used for calibration. 
 38 
The formation of complex between PSS- and Zn2+ through chelation could also be 
examined by FTIR analysis, as shown in Figure 2. The absorption peak around 
1610cm-1 was assigned to C=C ring stretch from the aromatic group. The absorption 
at 1390cm-1and 1190cm-1 indicated the asymmetric and symmetric stretch of S=O, 
marked as two dotted lines. The significant red-shift of asymmetric stretch of S=O 
from 1390cm-1 to 1350 cm-1 in ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites was observed, and slight  
red shifts of symmetric stretch of S=O from 1190 cm-1 to 1175 cm-1 in PSS-Zn 
complexes as well as ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites were also observed in the spectra. 
Moreover, the broad band in the vicinity of 400-600cm-1 was attributed to the Zn-O 
vibration.  
Figure 3 showed the X-ray diffraction pattern of ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites in 
sample A1. The ZnO exhibited three main peaks around 2θ=32o, 34.4 o, and 36.6 o, 
corresponding to (100), (002), and (001), respectively. The position of the diffraction 
peaks was in good agreement with JCPD card 36-1451. It revealed that the crystal 
structure of ZnO particles was not changed by the presence of PSS-Na in the 
composites, and it could be indexed as the hexagonal wurtzite structure.  
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites and pristine PSS-
Na(Mw=1000000) under air atmosphere were compared and demonstrated in Fig 4. 
Upon heating from 110oC to 800oC, it was observed that the majority of the weight 
loss, due to the degradation of PSS chains, occurred between 400oC to 600oC. The 
char yields at 800oC in samples A1 to A3 were about 90% to 96%, revealing that the 
content of PSS- in ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites increased as the amount of PSS-Na in 
feed increased. It could be found that not all the feeding PSS-Na was immobilized 
into the ZnO/PSS- nanocomposites. 
 40 
weakened electrostatic repulsions. On the contrary, with a higher PSS- content in 
ZnO/PSS- nanocomposite particles such as in sample A1, a smaller effective particle 
size as well as a more sparse coverage of ZnO/PSS- nanoparticles on the interface 
resulted in a higher equilibrium interfacial tension value. In system A3, when the 
particle concentration increased from 0.6wt% to 1.2wt%, a lower equilibrium 
interfacial tension was also observed in Figure 5. Relative works on the kinetics of 
nanoparticle self-assembly at liquid/liquid interface were well-documented in recent 
literatures.52-53. 
Preparation of DPE-Capped Macroinitiator. The preparation of DPE-capped 
macroinitiator was performed by a bulk polymerization at 70  oC, and the molar ratio 
of MMA: AIBN: DPE was fixed as 330: 2: 1. The formation mechanism of DPE-
controlled polymerization was demonstrated in Scheme 3.37,38 Once the growing chain 
Pn* was capped by DPE molecule, they combined and a DPE-ended radical Pn-D* 
formed. Furthermore, two DPE-ended radicals were also possible to from a semi-
quinoid structure, P2t. These reversible reactions were responsible for the livingness of 
DPE-controlled polymerization. After polymerization for 4 hours, the molecular 
weight and PDI of the obtained PMMA macroinitiator were measured as 21000g/mol 
and 1.35, respectively.  
Living Block Copolymer Latexes from Pickering Emulsion Polymerization. 
BA was polymerized in the presence of DPE-capped PMMA macroinitiator at 80oC to 
synthesize DPE-controlled PMMA-b-PBA living block copolymers. We have 
previously reported the synthesis in either homogeneous and miniemulsion systems,47 
with the miniemulsion system showing higher reaction rate and better controlled 
living character. The solvent in the system was also a crucial role to the living block 
copolymer formations. As more solvent was present in the polymerization system, a 
 42 
polymerization, which may cause by the elevated temperature during the course of 
polymerization as well as the slightly aggregated nature of the ZnO/PSS- 
nanoparticles. On the other hand, if the amount of stabilizer ZnO/PSS- was not 
enough to stabilize the emulsion droplets, polydispersed particles and ZnO/PSS- 
sparsely covered latexes were obtained in the experiment. The TEM photograph of 
the latex in system C4 was shown in Figure 7(c). 
The Controlled Living Characters in Pickering Emulsion Polymerization. The 
profiles of BA conversion and –ln(1-x) versus polymerization time, molecular weight 
as well as PDI versus BA conversion, and GPC diagrams of samples C3 to C4 were 
shown in Figure 8(a)-(c) and Figure 9(a)-(c). Sample B1, conducted via miniemulsion 
polymerization using anionic surfactant SDS as a stabilizer, was taken as a reference 
to evaluate the livingness of PMMA-b-PBA block copolymers in Pickering emulsion 
polymerization for samples C1 to C4. The results showed that, the polymerization rate 
was in a negligible order of B1>C3>C2=C1, implying that the controlled living 
characteristics of Pickering emulsion polymerizations stabilized by ZnO/PSS- 
nanoparticles, particularly in system C3 was as well as the emulsion stabilized by the 
conventional SDS surfactant. The ZnO/PSS- nanoparticles covering on the emulsion 
droplets effectively impeded the contact of macroinitiators and growing chains with 
the aqueous phase. Linear profiles of –ln(1-x) versus time and Mn versus conversion 
in Figure 8(a) and Figure 8(b) verified the livingness of systems C1 to C3. The slight 
variation of the reaction rates from C1 to C3 was related to the amount of PSS- 
immobilized into the ZnO/PSS- nanoparticles. As mentioned above in the oil/water 
interfacial property measurements, the less degree of coverage on the oil/water 
interface in system C1 resulted in a little higher degree of chain terminations. 
Therefore the polymerization rate was slightly decreased. It was concluded that the 
 44 
coexistence of terminated polymer chains and growing chains in system C4. For 
sample C3, the PDI values increased from 1.4 to 1.9 during the polymerization 
whereas for sample C4 increased from 1.4 to 2.5 as shown in Figure 9(b). The 
bimodal molecular weight distributions explained the higher values of PDI. 
Long Term Colloidal Stability. The colloidal stability of ZnO/PSS- suspensions 
and the block copolymer latexes was evaluated by Sapp(%) in Table 1. Figure 10(a)-(d) 
showed the photographs of ZnO/PSS- aqueous dispersions A1 to A3 and the latex C3 
in sedimentation experiments after certain times. The values of Sapp(%)of A1, A2, and 
A3 were approximately 85%, 70%, and 60% respectively after 7 days, and about 50%, 
40%, and 0% after 14 days. Eventually the Sapp(%) of A1 to A3 all dropped to 0% 
after 21days. Surprisingly, the latexes possessed excellent long term stability over 
three month in systems C1 to C3. No apparent sedimentation or phase separation was 
observed. The long term stability of the Pickering emulsion latexes was superior to 
the ZnO/PSS- nanoparticle suspensions, which was attributed to the anchoring of 
ZnO/PSS- nanoparticles onto the oil/water interface. Thus the flocculation of 
ZnO/PSS- nanoparticles was effectively restrained by sterical obstruction. Meanwhile, 
the presence of negative charge at the oil-water interface due to the spontaneous 
adsorption of hydroxyl ions58 was also responsible for the long term stability of the 
“patchy colloidal particles covered“ latex after polymerization.  
 In latex C4, certain extent of phase separation was observed after several days. The 
polymers together with the oil phase were at the top and the ZnO/PSS- nanoparticles 
were at the bottom of the vial. The instability of latex C4 was due to the lack of 
stabilizers in the emulsion system. The amount of ZnO/PSS- was not enough to 
prevent from the coalescence of latex particles after a period of time. It is worth

I. Stable Dispersion of PEDOT Latex Nanoparticles Synthesized by Emulsion 
Polymerization: Conversion Determination and Application to pH buffering. 
 
In this research, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) latex nanoparticles were 
prepared by emulsion polymerization and the conversion of EDOT was determined by 
different methods.  Two kinds of oxidants, Fe(OTs)3 and H2O2, were introduced to 
increase the stability of latexes.  Hydrogen peroxide could oxidize reduced form of 
Fe3+ ions and transform them back to active Fe3+ ions.  This cyclic 
oxidation-reduction process results in the regeneration of Fe3+ ions and leads to higher 
conversion.  The nanoparticle sizes obtained from dynamic light scattering and TEM 
measurements showed that the sizes of nonoparticles were around 100 nm.  Dark

The ZnO nanoparticles solution were prepared from Zinc acetate and Sodium 
hydroxide by Hydrothermal Method. “Physical Adsorption” was the way to 
prepare the F1/ZnO and F10/ ZnO composite films from R1/ZnO and R10/ZnO 
respectively. The pH buffering ability was evaluated by soaking the film 
in the pH4 or pH10 solution, and the variation of pH value was recorded 
with time. The result shows that F10/ZnO composite film obtained from 
R10/ZnO could be a good buffering material to justify either pH4 or pH10 
solution to pH7.4 in 5min.
