2The Optimization of Medicine Formulation Using Mixture
Experiments
Peng-Sen Wang Jeng-Jung Fang
Abstract — Medicine is composed by several
components. The quality characteristic of medicine
usually depends on the proportions of its
components. The research studied the component
proportions of medicine SIBELIUM capsule
without considering its mixture amount and other
process factors. Design points of
symmetric-simplex design and design generated by
the XVERT algorithm are both discussed in the
research. There are two quality characteristics of
the medicine being considered. After collecting
the data of the two designs and searched for their
corresponding prediction equations, the two
quality characteristics are optimized using
desirability function. The research found the
optimal component proportions of the two designs
are pretty close and the optimal values of the two
quality characteristics are almost the same.

I. INTRODUCTION
Pharmaceutical Industry is highly relied on
the research and development of its products.
The reduction of R&D cost and its R&D time
can be very competitive for the company.
Medicines are mixtures which can cure the
disease and relief pain of the patients. The
research of medicine has to consider both its
process physics and its chemistry of human
acceptability. The multiple quality characteristics
of medicines and cost efficiency are major issues
of medicine research and
Medicines are mixtures of multiple
components. The components proportions are
critical to the effectiveness of the medicine. Thus

the quality characteristic of medicine
depends on the proportions of components. The
mixture experiments are especially useful for
solving the problem of searching the optimal
proportions of the components [1]. The research
studied the component proportions of medicine
SIBELIUM capsule using deigns of mixtures.
Two quality characteristics were considered and
collected data were analyzed by response
methodology to find the prediction equations for
each quality characteristic. Finally the optimal
component proportions were found through
desirability function. The research only
considered the component proportions for two
quality characteristics. Both the mixture amount
and process factors are fixed in all experiments.
SIBELIUM ® 5mg capsules was developed
by Janssen-Cilag company in 1980. Each
capsule contains 5.9mg of Flunarizine. It is used
to cure headache and dizziness. It is widely
spread in several countries around the world.
II. MIXTURE EXPERIMENTS
Any experiments relate to the proportions
of its components are called mixture
experiments. Scheffe[3] defined the mixture
problem. Suppose a mixture is composed of q
components and the ith component contain
ix of it. Each component proportion can’t be
negative and the sum of all component
proportions must be equal to 1. That is
,0ix i=1, 2, …, q
and 1...21  q
q
i
i xxxx (1)
The factor space of any mixture experiment is
reduced by one dimension due to the restriction
of equation (1) which is different from that of
factorial experiment. For a q-factor factorial
experiment, its feasible factor space is a
q-dimensional space called q-cuboid. However
for a q-component mixture experiment, its
feasible region is a (q-1) dimensional space
either upper or lower bound restrictions on its
components, one will convert the component
proportions ix into Pseudo-components through
linear transformation.
For a q-component mixture experiment with
both upper and lower bound restrictions on its
components, one might one might use one of the
designs of Extreme Vertices Design, XVERT
algorithm [6], XVERT1 algorithm [7],
Distance-Based Design [9], Symmetric-Simplex
Design [8, 9], and Computer-Aided Design
[2,4].
IV. OPTIMIZATION OF MULTIPLE QUALITY
CHARACTERISTICS (DESIRABILITY
FUNCTION)
Derringer and Suich [1] developed the
optimization method using desirability function
for multiple quality characteristics. The
transformation of yi into individual desirability
function di could be three possible way where di
is between 0 and 1. If response values equal to
target, the value of is di 1. If the value of yi is not
acceptable, the di is value of 0. One will select
the di values with maximal D value where

response variables. For quality characteristics
with various specifications, the transformation of
yi into di could be three possible ways.

V. MIXTURE EXPERIMENT ON SIBELIUM
CAPSULE
SIBELIUM capsule contains one major
component and three components to shape the
capsule. The major component is not changeable
and only three shaping components are studied.
Angle of repose and bulk density are the two
quality characteristics being measured. Bad
angle of repose will cause bad fluidity of powder
and large bulk density results difficulty in filling
powder into capsules. The mixture amount and
the values of process variables are set fixed
through all experiments. The four components of
SIBELIUM capsule are shown in Table 1 and its
original restrictions are shown as Table 2. The
specifications of the two quality characteristics
are shown in Table 3.

After collecting all data, the analysis of
variance is done by Design-Expert software. Any
component with p-value less than 0.05 will be
selected in the model. For each selected model,
we also checked the assumptions of normality,
independence, and consistency of the residuals.
And we checked any outliers in the data.
For the quality characteristics of angle of
repose in Symmetric-Simplex design, we select
special cubic model for it. The 2AR equals
0.5287 which is not sufficient to explain the
angle of repose. The value of 2AR is not large
enough since the gage to measure the angle of
repose is not accurate to distinguish the
difference among the collected sample. The
prediction equation for angle of repose (Y1) is
Y1＝

The confirmation runs were executed and
their average values are all within its 95%
confidence interval and all individual values are
within 95% prediction interval which verified
the selected model is appropriate.
For the quality characteristics of bulk density
in Symmetric-Simplex design, we select special
cubic model for it. The 2AR equals 0.9982
which indicates the model can sufficiently
explain the variance among the data. The
prediction equation for bulk density (Y2) is

(4) Optimize the quality characteristics by the
method of desirability function.
Design-Expert is used to get the optimal
quality characteristics based on the
specifications of the two quality characteristics
and the method of desirability function. The
angle of repose is with smallest the better
property while bulk density is with nominal the
best property. The optimal proportions for each
design are shown in Table 7 and the optimal
predicted values for each quality characteristic
are shown in Table 8.

III. DESIGNS OF MIXTURE EXPERIMENTS  
For a q-component mixture experiment without upper and 
lower bounds on its components, either {q, m} 
simplex-lattice design or a simplex-centroid design will be a 
good choice. 
For a three component mixture experiment, the factor 
spaces of the {3, m} simplex-lattice design and the 
simplex-centroid design are shown as Figure 2 and Figure 3 
respectively.

For a q-component mixture experiment with lower bound 
restrictions on its components, one will convert the 
component proportions xj into pseudo-components through 
linear transformation. Assume Li is the lower bound of xi, 
that is  
ii xL ≤≤0 ，i = 1, 2, …, q             (6)

V. MIXTURE EXPERIMENT ON SIBELIUM CAPSULE  
SIBELIUM capsule contains one major component and 
three components called excipients to shape the capsule. The 
major component is not changeable and only three excipients 
are studied. Angle of repose and bulk density are the two 
quality characteristics being measured. Bad angle of repose 
will cause bad fluidity of medicine powder and large bulk 
density results difficulty in filling medicine powder into 
capsules. The mixture amount and the values of process 
variables are set fixed through all experiments. The four 
components of SIBELIUM capsule are shown in Table 1 and 
its original restrictions are shown as Table 2. The 
specifications of the two quality characteristics are shown in 
Table 3.

The steps of the mixture experiment are as the followings: 
(1) Check any hidden restrictions among component 
variables and the consistency of the restrictions [9]. They are 
shown in Table 4. The research used the software of 
Design-Expert to accomplish it.

(2) Choose appropriate design of the mixture experiment.  
The experiment is a case with both upper and lower 
restrictions on components. The factor space will be a 
convex. We adopted symmetric-simplex design and the 
design generated by XVERT algorithm to complete the 
experiment. Each design contains three points for 
confirmation run. The design points of symmetric-simplex 
design are shown in Table 5 and Figure 6. The design points 
generated by XVERT algorithm are shown in Table 6.  
(3) Collect experiment data and analyze the data. Data are 
collected based on the two designs. For each run we collected 
six data. That is the number of replications is six.

After collecting all data, the analysis of variance is done by 
Design-Expert software. Any component with p-value less 
than 0.05 will be selected in the model. For each selected 
model, we also checked the assumptions of normality, 
independence, and consistency of the residuals. And we 
checked any outliers in the data. 
 
 
 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The research showed how to apply mixture experiments on 
the development of medicines. The research studied the 
component proportions of medicine SIBELIUM capsule 
without considering its mixture amount and other process 
factors. Design points of symmetric-simplex design and 
design points generated by the XVERT algorithm are both 
studied in the research. There are two quality characteristics 
of the medicine being considered.  After collecting the data of 
the two designs and analyzed for their corresponding 
prediction equations, it showed the optimal values of the two 
quality characteristics by symmetric-simplex design and 
XVERT algorithm both met their specification with high 
values of desirability function. 
The research demonstrates mixture experiments are very 
suitable for the optimization of medicine formulation.
