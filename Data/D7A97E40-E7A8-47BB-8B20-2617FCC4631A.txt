ABSTRACT 
 
This project is aimed to investigate the transport phenomena, and search for the 
effective ways to improve the transfer performance for convection in a channel cabinet 
containing multi-boards mounted with heat generating blocks. 
For the investigation on the convective characteristics, the related articles assumed 
that the sub-streams passing through each board had the same flow and thermal behaviors.  
The thermally-periodic boundary condition was imposed on the two successive boards.  
Thus these articles examined only one of the boards in the channel.  This study 
rigorously investigates the transfer behaviors for the all board in the system.  The results 
show that, owing to the effects of channel wall and thermal interaction among the 
sub-streams through the conducting boards, the deviation in transfer characteristic among 
different boards are rather significant. The difference are more evident for the cases with 
large heat conductivity ratio of board to fluid Kpf, heat conductivity ratio of block to fluid 
Kbf, and block spacing Sb. The trend is inverse for the various block height Hb and 
Reynolds number Re. Comparing the maximum temperatures in blocks mounted on 
different boards, the difference can be up to 61?when 0 ? Kpf ? 200, 100 ? Kbf ? 200, 
0.05 ? Hb ? 0.15, 0.5 ? Sb ? 2.5 and 200 ? Re ? 1000.  For the investigation on 
the enhancement of heat transfer performance, the methods of constructing shots in the 
board and installing a baffle on the channel wall can effectively increase the heat transfer 
coefficient and reduce the hot spot temperature.  The maximum enhancements of the 
average musselt numbers are about 192% and 66% for the front and rear surfaces of 
blocks, respectively.  Meanwhile the maximum reduction in the hot spot temperature is 
about 42%.  
The obtained results of this study would improve our understanding on the 
complicated phenomena of relative thermo-fluid system, and enhance the design and 
operation technologies of the domestic industry.  Some of the results had been published, 
which includes three international conference papers, two international journal articles, 
and one journal article is in revision.  In addition, 22 under graduated students joined 
during the execution of this project.  These student had been trained to have the ability 
to investigate the thermo-fluid engineering problem.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and literature Review 
Convective heat transfer from block heat sources to forced stream is widely 
encountered in engineering applications, such as in the cooling of electronic system, solar 
collectors, furnace and chemical processing equipments. An example for the electronic 
equipment cooling is shown in Figure 1.1 that a cabinet contains multiple boards mounted 
with block heat sources [1]. Air is driven to flow through the boards and remove the heat 
dissipated from the blocks. Over the years, a lot of researchers have contributed their 
efforts to investigate the characteristics of forced convective flows over block heat sources.  
However, these reports mainly investigated the systems with blocks mounted on a single 
board.  The articles on the system containing multi-boards mounted with block heat 
sources are still rather limit.  Besides, most published work assumed that the sub-streams 
passing through each board had the same flow and thermal behaviors.  Meanwhile the 
thermally-periodic boundary condition was imposed on the two successive boards.  
Therefore the results did not illustrate the difference in the heat transfer characteristics for 
blocks mounted on different boards, which would be not applicable for the system with a 
small number of boards.  The main objective of this study is to rigorously examine the 
flow and thermal characteristics of each sub-stream in a channel containing multi-boards 
mounted with heat generating blocks, and the influences of thermal interactions among the 
sub-streams of fluid through the conducting boards.  Great attention is focused on the 
differences in the heat transfer behaviors of the blocks mounted on different boards. 
Because of its frequent occurrence in the industrial applications, the convective heat 
transfer from heated blocks have been studied by numerous researchers in the past two 
decades.  Due to the space limitation, only a brief review of the previous literature is 
presented below. Kang et al. [2] , and Nakayama and Park [3] experimentally examined 
the effects of block height and wall conduction on the heat convection for air flow over a 
two-dimensional, isolated block heat source mounted on plate. An experiment has been 
carried out by Nakamura and Igarashi [4] to investigate the forced convection heat transfer 
from a low-profile block placed in a rectangular duct. Kim et al [5] examined the 
characteristics of heat transfer from two heated blocks in a channel with pulsating the flow 
at the channel inlet. Lehmann and Wirtz [6], and Agonafer and Moffatt [7] experimentally 
and numerically investigated the characteristics of flows over an array of two-dimensional, 
rectangular components mounted on channel wall.  Heat was applied to the top surface of 
one component.  It was found that the variation of heat transfer coefficient along the 
heated surface is rather different to that for smooth channel wall. Davalath and 
Bayazitoglu [8] numerically predicted the behaviors of forced convection between parallel

Equations (2.7) - (2.12) refer to the usual no-slip conditions on all the solid walls, and the 
assumption of thermal insulation for channel walls. The stream is with uniform velocity 
and uniform temperature at the channel inlet, and with hydrodynamic and thermal 
fully-developed conditions at the location far downstream from the trailing edges of board. 
The continuities of temperature and heat flux are satisfactory at the fluid-solid interface, 
and at the block-board interface. 
The local Nusselt number along the front, top and rear surfaces of each block heat source 
is of interest to the thermal system designer.  It is defined as

limiting situation with long, parallel boards and without the effects of thermal interactions 
among the boards are compared to the relevant literatures.  Good agreement is found 
between the present predictions and the results presented by Davalath and Bayazitoglu [8]. 
Through these program tests the proposed numerical scheme is considered to be 
appropriate for the present problem under investigation. 
 
 
2.2 Results and Discussion 
Inspection of the forgoing analysis indicates that the flow and heat transfer 
characteristics in the present system depend on 14 parameters. Since a vast number of 
governing dimensionless parameters are required to characterize the system, a 
comprehensive analysis of all combinations of problems is not practical. The main 
objective here is to present a sample of results that illustrates the effects of the flow and 
thermal interactions among the sub-streams through the conducting boards on the heat 
transfer characteristics of heat generating blocks mounted on short boards in a plate 
channel. While computation can be performed with any combination, the effects of Kpf , 
Kbf , Ly, Sb and Re are investigated in this work. In particular, air ( Pr = 0.7 ) flowing 
through the channel with Lx = 1.5, De = 1, Da = Df = 0.5, Sl = 0.1, Su = Sp = 0.25 and Hp = 
0.05 is considered. The results are presented for the cases with Kpf  varying from 0 to 200, 
Kbf from 100 to 200, Ly from 0.05 to 0.15, Sb from 0.5 to 2.5 and Re from 200 to 1000. 
Initially, the flow structure in the channel is examined. The effects of the block height 
on the distribution of streamlines for the system with Sb = 1.5 and Re = 500 are portrayed 
in Figure 2.2. It is seen in Figure 2.2(a) that a primary recirculation cell occupies almost 
the whole gap between the blocks. The result is similar to those reported by Dacalath and 
Bayazitoglu [8], and Kim et al. [10] The results in Figure 2.2(b) for the case with small 
block height Ly = 0.05 show that weak  recirculation cells appears in each gap between 
the blocks and behind the last block. In addition the cells are very close to the rear surface 
of block. Because the spacing between the blocks is much larger than the block. It is 
interesting to observe that the streamline apparently distort in the region near the leading 
edges of board when the flow approaches the blocks. The distortion is more evident at the 
location vicinity to the low board. The streamlines near the bottom channel wall are 
distorted upward. For the case with large block height Hb = 0.15, the results in Figure 2.2(c) 
indicate that the primary recirculation cells in the gaps between the blocks and behind the 
last blocks are rather strong. The streamlines near the bottom channel wall distort 
downward in front of the leading edge of low board, which is different to that plotted in 
 9
heat transfer coefficient occurs at the front top corner of block. The Nusselt numbers for 
rear surfaces are substantially smaller than those for front surfaces of blocks. This is due to 
the fact that the recirculation cells in the gaps between the blocks and behined the last 
blocks are very close to the rear surfaces of blocks. It is also mentioned that the Nu’s for 
the top surfaces slightly increase at the positions near the rear top corners of blocks. This 
can be reasonably explained as that the sub-streams turn to flow downward into the gaps 
when they pass the rear top corners of blocks. For the case with conducting boards Kpf 
=100, it can be clearly seen in Figure 2.5 that the Nu’s for the up board are significantly 
higher than those for the middle and low boards, except the first blocks. However the Nu’s 
for the middle and low boards are very close. A comparison on the results in Figure 2.5 
and 2.6 indicates that the differences in Nu’s among the boards become more evident for 
the case with larger Hb. Again these behaviors reveal that the thermal interactions among 
the conducting boards would play an important role on the heat transfer behaviors of a 
system containing multi-boards mounted with heat generating blocks. It is interesting to 
note in Figure 2.6 that the Nu’s for the top surfaces drastically drop with X in the region 
near the front top corners. But they turn to rise until the location about at 0.2 of block 
length. This is due to the fact that, for the case with large Ly, the sub-streams turn to flow 
toward the top surfaces of blocks when they pass over the front top corners of blocks. 
The maximum temperature in the system is important to the performance of thermal 
system. Finally the maximum temperatures in the last blocks mounted on different boards 
are presented, and the effects of thermal interactions among the boards on variations of the 
maximum temperatures are discussed. Table 2.1 presents the maximum temperatures in 
last blocks mounted on the up, middle and low boards. For the limiting case with insulated 
boards Kpf = 0, the differences in θmax among the different boards are negligible small. In 
addition, the θmax for Kpf = 0 is substantially higher than that for Kpf = 100. For the cases 
with conducting boards, the differences in θmax among the boards are rather significant. 
The ∆θmax is about 48? for Kpf = Kbf = 100, and 50? for Kpf = Kbf = 200. Table 2.2 and 
2.3 list the effects of Ly and Sb on the variations of θmax. It is seen that the ∆θmax is higher 
for the cases with smaller Hb or Sb. The ∆θmax can be up to 61? when Hb = 0.05, as 
written in Table 2.2. The data listed in table 2.4 show that ∆θmax is higher for the situation 
with smaller Re, and it is 51.1? for Re = 200. The above results illustrate that the thermal 
interactions among the boards can cause significantly difference in the thermal 
characteristics among the blocks mounted on different boards.

3.2 Results and discussion  
Inspection of the forgoing analysis indicates that the flow and heat transfer 
characteristics in the present system depend on 16 parameters. Since a vast number of 
governing dimensionless parameters are required to characterize the system, a 
comprehensive analysis of all combinations of problems is not practical. The main 
objective here is to present a sample of results that illustrates the effects of the flow and 
thermal interactions among the sub-streams through conduction boards on the heat transfer 
characteristics of heat generating blocks mounted on short boards in a channel. While 
computation can be performed with any combination, the effects of Kpf , Kbf , Ly, Sb and Re 
are investigated in this work. In particular, air ( Pr = 0.7 ) flowing through the channel with 
Cz = 1, Lx = 1.5, Lz = 0.25, De = 1, Da = Df = 0.5, Sl = 0.1, Su = Sp = 0.25 and Hp = 0.05 is 
considered. The results are presented for the cases with Kpf  varying from 0 to 200, Kbf 
from 100 to 200, Ly from 0.05 to 0.15, Sb from 0.5 to 2.5 and Re from 200 to 1000. 
Intially , the temperature distributions in the rectangular channel are examined. Figure 
3.2 plots the isotherms on different X-Y sections for the limiting case with insulated board 
K pf =0. The results in Figure 3.2(a) for the section across the middle of blocks indicate that 
the isotherms in the boards and the respective blocks mounted on different boards are 
rather similar. The isotherms in the regions occupied by the fluid between the boards, or 
between the up channel plate and board are also similar to each other.  The hot spots in 
the blocks are at block-board interfaces, and near the rear surfaces of blocks. In addition 
the isotherms in the region near the rear surfaces of blocks are more loose than that in the 
region near the front surface of blocks.  These are due to the fact that the recirculation 
cells in the gaps between the blocks and behined the last blocks are very close to the rear 
surfaces of blocks. Figure 3.2(b) and 3.2(c) represent the temperature distributions on the 
section across the left and right side surfaces of blocks, respectively. It is seen that the 
isotherms in Figures 3.2(b) and 3.2(c) are similar to those in Figure 3.2(a). A comparision 
on the corresponding curves with same values in Figure 3.2(b) and 3.2(c) reveals that the 
isotherms for the section across the right side surfaces of blocks terminate on the up 
channel wall at farther downstream locations. This implies that the heat transfer 
performance for the section across the side surfaces of blocks is better than that for the 
 25
the thermal interactions among the boards would play an important role on the heat 
transfer behaviors of a system containing multi-boards mounted with heat generating 
blocks. An inspection on the results in Figure 3.5 and 3.7 reveals that the Nu’s are higher 
for a system with smaller Sb 
The contours of Nusselt numbers for the top surfaces of third blocks mounted on 
different boards are represented in Figure 3.8 and 3.9. For the limiting case with insulated 
boards K pf =0, the distributions of Nusselt numbers in Figure 3.8(a)-3.8(b) are rather 
similar to each other. In addition, the convex Nu curves are asymmetric with their apexes 
locating to the left sides of the blocks. This means that the heat transfer performance of the 
top surface of blocks is asymmetric with respect to the centerline, and it is better for the 
right side. For the case with conducting boards K pf =100, the results in Figure 3.9 indicates 
that the Nusselt numbers for the third block mounted on up board are higher than those for 
the middle and low boards.  
The maximum temperature in the system is important to the performance of thermal 
system. Finally the maximum temperatures in the last blocks mounted on different boards 
are presented, and the effects of thermal interactions among the boards on variations of the 
maximum temperatures are discussed. Table 3.1 presents the maximum temperatures in 
last blocks mounted on the up, middle and low boards. For the limiting case with insulated 
boards Kpf =0, the differences in θmax among the different boards are negligible small. In 
addition, the θmax for Kpf =0 is substantially higher than that for Kpf =100. For the cases 
with conducting boards, the differences in θmax among the boards are rather significant. 
The ∆θmax is about 36? for Kpf = Kbf =100, and 39? for Kpf = Kbf =200. Table 3.2 and 
3.3 list the effects of Ly and Sb on the variations of θmax. It is seen that the ∆θmax is higher 
for the cases with smaller Ly or larger Sb. The ∆θmax can be up to 47.7? when Ly =0.05, 
as written in Table 3.2. The data listed in Table 3.4 show that ∆θmax is higher for the 
situation with smaller Re, and it is 47.2 for Re=200. The above results illustrate that the 
thermal interactions among the boards can cause significantly difference in the thermal 
characteristics among the blocks mounted on different boards.

Equations (4.5) - (4.9) refer to the usual no-slip conditions on all the solid walls, and the 
assumption of thermal insulation for channel plates, board and baffle. The stream has 
uniform velocity and uniform temperature at the channel inlet, and hydrodynamic and 
thermal fully developed conditions at locations far downstream of the trailing edge of the 
board. With n representing the outward normal direction, equation (4.8) imposes a uniform 
 41
nature of the present problem, it is necessary to make sure that the boundary 
conditions at X → ∞ given by equation (4.6) do not artificially constrain the solution. To 
ensure that the results are not affected by the longitudinal size of the computation domain, 
tests are performed by varying the longitudinal size of the computation length downstream 
of the trailing edge of board Lc. The difference in the average Nusselt numbers between Lc 
= 30 and Lc = 50 are within 0.4%. Thus, in all the subsequent numerical simulation the 
computation domain with Lc = 30 is used to simulate the very long channel. Secondly, the 
results for the limiting situation with long, parallel boards in which there is not the 
appearance of slot and baffle are compared to the relevant literatures.  Good agreement is 
found between the present predictions and the results presented by Davalath and 
Bayazitoglu [6]. Through these program tests the proposed numerical scheme is 
considered to be appropriate for the present problem under investigation. 
 
4.2 Results and Discussions 
Inspection of the forgoing analysis indicates that the flow and heat transfer 
characteristics in the present system depend on 17 parameters. Since a vast number of 
dimensionless governing parameters are required to characterize the system, a 
comprehensive analysis of all combinations of problems is not practical. The main 
objective here is to present a sample of results that illustrates the enhancement of heat 
transfer from block heat sources on a short board to air stream in a channel by constructing 
slots in the board and installing a baffle onto the channel wall. While computation can be 
performed with any combination, the effects of dimensionless spacing between board and 
bottom channel plate C2, dimensionless length of slot Ls, dimensionless baffle height Hp, 
dimensionless distance between channel inlet and baffle Dp, allocation of baffle on the up 
or bottom channel wall, and Reynolds number Re are investigated in this work. In 
particular, air ( Pr = 0.7 ) flowing through the channel with W = 0.1, Le = 0.5, La = Lf  = 1, 
Hb = Lb = 0.3, Db = 0.7, Ds = 0.4, Df = 0.1 and Lp = 0.1 is considered. The results are 
presented for the cases with C2 varying from 0.2 to 0.4, Ls from 0 to 0.2, Hp from 0 to 0.15, 
Dp from 4 to 7 and Re from 100 to 500. The configurations of cases to be investigated are 
classified into four types, as listed in Table 4.1. 
Initially, the effects of slot and baffle on the flow structure in the channel is portrayed 
by the streamlines for the system with fixed C2 = 0.2 and Re = 500. For the limiting case 
without the appearance of slot and baffle, the results in Figure 4.2(a) show that a primary 
recirculation cell appears in each gap between the blocks. The structures of the cells are 
similar to those in many previous articles, such as reported by Davalath and Bayazitoglu 
[6]. A scrupulous investigation on this figure reveals that, in the region near the trailing 
 43
the up substream is deflected drastically into the fourth gap, and a large portion of it passes 
across the fourth slot. A comparison on Figures 4.3(c) and 4.3(d) reveals that the 
movement of baffle from the up channel wall to the bottom channel wall results in evident 
change in the flow structure. 
Figures 4.4(a) – 4.4(d) illustrate the effect of slots and baffle on the temperature 
distributions for the system with the board placed at C2 = 0.2. For the limiting case without 
the appearance of slot and baffle, the isotherms plotted in Figure 4.4(a) indicate that the 
thermal layers along the top and front surfaces of blocks are thicker for latter blocks. 
However, the smallest of the thermal layers along the rear surfaces of blocks is for the last 
block. This is due to the fact that there are fluids flowing from the area of Y < C2 upward 
to the area of Y > C2  in the region near the trailing edge of board, and a portion of the 
fluids adversely circulate toward the rear surface of last block before turning to flow 
downstream. Consequently, the heat is more easily dissipated from the rear surface of the 
last block. In addition, the isotherms in the regions near the rear surfaces of blocks look 
parallel. A comparison on the isotherms plotted in Figures 4.4(a) and 4.4(b) reveals that the 
thermal layers along the rear surfaces of the forward four blocks are thinner for the case 
with slots in the board. This can be attributed to the fact that, for the case with the 
appearance of slots, the fluids can pass across the slots from the area of Y < C2 upward 
into the gaps. The fluids circulate toward the rear surfaces of blocks before leaving the 
gaps, which can effectively enhance the heat transfer from the rear surfaces of blocks to 
the air flow. In addition, it is seen in Figure 4.4(b) that the isotherms in the vicinity of the 
rear surface of the last block become rather skew owing to the appearance of a 
counterclockwise recirculation cell in this region. It is observed in Figure 4.4(c) that, with 
the installation of a baffle onto the up channel wall at the position behind the fifth block, 
the temperatures are significantly reduced in the region around the fifth block. A 
scrupulous investigation on the results in Figures 4.4(c) and 4.4(d) indicates that a 
movement of baffle from the up channel wall to the bottom channel wall could apparently 
drop the temperatures around the blocks. Shown in Figures 4.5(a) – 4.5(d) are the 
temperature distributions for the cases with the board placed at C2 = 0.4. An examination 
on the results in Figures 4.4(a) and 4.5(a) indicates that the differences in temperature 
distributions between C2 = 0.2 and C2 = 0.4 are not substantial in the vicinity of the blocks. 
This implies that, for the system without the appearance of slot and baffle, the heat transfer 
characteristics for the blocks are not sensitive to the variation of board location as Re = 
500. The values of isotherms in the region near the fourth and fifth blocks in Figures 
 45
rear surfaces of blocks, respectively. The hot spot in the system is important to the 
performance of thermal system. Table 4.4 presents the effects of slot and baffle on the 
maximum temperatures for the cases at various C2 and Re. It is seen that the hot spot 
temperatures for the cases of Type II are evidently smaller than those for Type I. Thus 
the constructing of slots in the board can effectively reduce the temperatures of 
blocks. In addition, the results in Table 4.4 indicates that the method of combined slot 
and baffle can further improve the thermal behaviors of the system. The reduction in 
θmax of type IV can be up to 39% for C2 = 0.2, and 42% for C2 = 0.4. It is interested 
to discuss the effect of baffle position on the variations of hot spot temperatures. 
Because the hot spot temperature locate at rear side of the fourth block, attention is 
focused on situations with the baffle installed near the fourth block or fifth block. The 
results in Table 4.5 illustrate that the hot spot temperatures are sensitive to the 
changes of the baffle position. Meanwhile, the optimum position of the baffle 
installation for obtaining lowest θmax varies with different conditions. 
Finally it is interested to investigate the change in pressure drop due to the 
appearance of slots and baffle. Figure 4.8 displays the ratios of ∆P  to I∆P  at 
different Re and C2. Here the I∆P  represents the pressure drop in the region from the 
channel inlet to the trailing edge of board for cases of Type I. While the ∆P  is that 
for cases of Type II, III and IV. The results in Figure 8 show that ∆P / I∆P  is higher 
for the cases with larger Re. In addition, the penalty of increase in pressure drop due 
to the construction of slots in the board (Type II) is rather small.

Concluding Remarks 
 
The main objective of this study includes two folds.  The first is to detailedly 
investigate multiple boards mounted with block heat sources.  The relative articles in the 
literature assumed that the heat transfer characteristics of the boards are same to one 
another.  The present study investigates the thermal behaviors for the ael boards in the 
system.  The second is to search for effective ways to enhance the thermal performance 
of the system.  What follows are the major results. 
1. For the investigation on convective characteristics 
The flow and thermal daracteristics has been examined for the cases with various Kpf, 
Kbf, Ly, Sb and Re. Owing to the effects of channel wall and thermal interactions among 
the boards through heat conduction, the difference in heat transfer characteristics among 
the blocks mounded on different board might be rather substantial. The difference is more 
significant for the cases with larger Kpf, Kbf, Sb or smaller Ly, Re. Comparing the 
maximum temperatures in blocks mounted on different boards, the maximum difference is 
about 61% when 0 ≤ Kpf ≤ 200, 100 ≤ Kbf ≤ 200, 0.05 ≤ Ly ≤ 0.15, 0.5 ≤ Sb ≤ 2.5 and 200 ≤ 
Re ≤ 1000. Meanwhile the maximum difference in the average Nusselt numbers Nu  for 
the top surfaces of blocks among the different boards is about 50.8%. These findings 
reveals that the thermally-periodic boundary condition imposed on two successive boards 
might result in substantial defect in relative engineering applications. 
2. For the enhancement of thermal performance 
The effects of slot and baffle on laminar forced convection in a channel containing a 
short board mounted with five block heat sources. Owing to the appearance of the slots in 
the board, a portion of the air stream can pass across the slots, either upward or downward. 
Thus the structures of recirculation cells in the gaps among the blocks and behind the last 
block are altered, and the heat transfer characteristics of the block heat sources are 
significantly improved. The method of combined construting slots in the board and 
installing a baffle onto the channel wall can further promote the thermal performance of 
the system. The maximum enhancements of the average Nusselt numbers are about 192% 
and 66% for the front and rear surfaces of blocks, respectively, when Pr = 0.7, Le = 0.5, La 
= Lf = 1, Hb = Lb = 0.3, Db = 0.7, Ds = 0.4, Df = 0.1, Lp = 0.1, 0.2 ? C2 ? 0.4, 0 ? Ls 
? 0.2, 0 ? Hp ? 0.15, 4 ? Dp ? 7 and 100 ? Re ? 500. The maximum 
reduction in the temperature of hot spot is about 42%. In addition, for the situation without 
the appearance of slot and baffle, the streamlines strongly defect in the region near the 
trailing edge of board. The Nu for the rear surface of last block is higher than that of 
forward blocks, and the position of hot spot of the system is not at last block. These 
phenomena are different to the results of previous studies with long boards.

???The physical system under consideration is with complicated

assumed that the heat transfer characteristics of the boards are same

boards in the system. The results show that, owing to the effects of 
channel wall and thermal interaction among sub-streams through the 
conducting boards, the differences in transfer characteristics and hot 
spot temperatures among the blocks mounted on different boards are 
rather significant. The methods of constructing slots and installing a 
baffle onto the channel wall can effectively enhance the thermal 
performance of block heat sources. These finding would avoid the

ABSTRACT 
This study numerically investigates the two-dimensional 
forced convection in a channel containing multi-boards 
mounted with heat generating blocks. The computation 
domain covers the all boards, and the region from the 
channel inlet to the location far downstream from the 
trailing edges of the boards. The flow and thermal 
characteristics are rigorously examined for the cases 
with various block height Hb, block spacing Sb, heat 
conductivity ratio of block to fluid Kbf, heat conductivity 
ratio of board to fluid Kpf, and Reynolds number Re. 
Results show that, owing to the effects of channel wall 
and thermal interaction among the sub-streams of fluid 
through the conducting boards, the differences in 
transfer characteristics among the blocks mounted on 
different boards are rather significant. The difference are 
more evident for the cases with larger Kbf, Kpf and Sb. 
The trend is inverse for the change of Hb and Re. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Convective heat transfer from block heat sources to 
forced stream is widely encountered in engineering 
applications, such as in the cooling of electronic system, 
solar collectors, furnace and chemical processing 
equipments.  Over the years, a lot of researchers have 
contributed their efforts to investigate the characteristics 
of forced convective flows over block heat sources.  
However, these reports mainly investigated the systems 
with blocks mounted on a single board.  The articles on 
the system containing multi-boards mounted with block 
heat sources are still rather limit.  Besides, most 
published work assumed that the sub-streams passing 
through each board had the same flow and thermal 
behaviors.  Meanwhile the thermally-periodic boundary 
condition was imposed on the two successive boards.  
Therefore the results did not illustrate the difference in 
the heat transfer characteristics for blocks mounted on 
different boards, which would be not applicable for the 
system with a small number of boards.  The main 
objective of this study is to rigorously examine the flow 
and thermal characteristics of each sub-stream in a 
channel containing multi-boards mounted with heat 
generating blocks, and the influences of thermal 
interactions among the sub-streams of fluid through the 
conducting boards.  Great attention is focused on the 
differences in the heat transfer behaviors of the blocks 
mounted on different boards. 
Because of its frequent occurrence in the industrial 
applications, the convective heat transfer from heated 
blocks have been studied by numerous researchers in 
the past two decades.  Due to the space limitation, only 
a brief review of the previous literature is presented 
below. Kang et al. [1] , and Nakayama and Park [2] 
experimentally examined the effects of block height and 
wall conduction on the heat convection for air flow over a 
two-dimensional, isolated block heat source mounted on 
plate. An experiment has been carried out by Nakamura 
and Igarashi [3] to investigate the forced convection 
heat transfer from a low-profile block placed in a 
rectangular duct. Kim and Kang [4] examined the 
characteristics of heat transfer from two heated blocks in 
a channel with pulsating the flow at the channel inlet. 
Lehmann and Wirtz [5], and Agonafer and Moffatt [6] 
experimentally and numerically investigated the 
characteristics of flows over an array of two-dimensional, 
rectangular components mounted on channel wall.  
Heat was applied to the top surface of one component.  
It was found that the variation of heat transfer coefficient 
along the heated surface is rather different to that for 
smooth channel wall. Davalath and Bayazitoglu [7] 
numerically predicted the behaviors of forced convection 
between parallel plates mounted with two-dimensional 
multiple blocks.  Results indicated that the heat flux 
distributions at the rear surfaces of blocks are much 
smaller than those at the front and top surfaces.  Kim 
and Anand [8] conducted the heat transfer between a 
series of parallel plates with surface-mounted discrete 
heat sources.  The repeated boundary conditions were 
imposed both in the cross-stream and stream wise 
directions in the study.  An analysis of heat transfer 
from rectangular heated block mounted on vertical and 
horizontal channel walls was carried out by Kim et al. [9].  
They mentioned that the impact of buoyancy effect on 
the flow and thermal fields is more pronounced for the 
vertically oriented channel.  Sparrow et al. [10] 
presented an experiment on heat transfer and pressure 
drop for air flow in arrays of heat generating modules 
deployed along one wall of a flat rectangular duct by 
using the naphthalene sublimation technique.  The 
effects of missing elements, height difference between 
modules and implanted barriers were investigated.  
Asako and Faghri [11, 12] performed a 
three-dimensional analysis for laminar flow through an 
array of heated square blocks.  Their results illustrated 
that the local heat flux on the top surface of block is 
higher than those on the front, side and rear surfaces.  
In addition, the Nusselt number decreases with the 
increasing block height and gradually approaches an 
asymptotic value.  An experimental study on the 
convective heat transfer for water cooling of inline and 
staggered arrays of protruding elements has been 
reported by Garimella and Eibeck [13].  It was 
concluded that staggering the elements of the arrays 
could significantly enhance the heat transfer coefficient. 
Wong and Peck [14] performed an experiment to 
investigate the effect of altitude on the characteristic of 
heat transfer from blocks to air stream. Furukawa and 
Yang [15] numerically investigated the thermal-fluid flow 
behaviors in a bundle of parallel boards with heat 
producing blocks.

SOLUTION METHOD  
The governing equations (1) - (6) and boundary 
conditions (7) – (12) are solved by a numerical scheme 
derived from the SIMPLER algorithm. The finite 
difference equations for P, U, V and θ are obtained by  
integrating the respective continuity, X-momentum, 
Y-momentum and energy equations over the control 
volumes via a power-law scheme. To obtain enhanced 
accuracy, nonuniform grids are arranged in the 
computational domain. The grid density is higher in the 
vicinity of the boards and heat generating blocks to 
capture the drastic variations of the flow and thermal 
fields. The line-by-line method with iteration is employed 
to solve the systems of algebraic equations obtained 
from discretizing the pressure, momentum and energy 
equations. The solution is considered to be converged 
when the relative differences of U, V, and θ at each node 
between two consecutive iterations, as well as the 
overall energy imbalance of the system are less than a 
prescribed value of 10-4. 
The proposed numerical algorithm is validated in two 
ways.  First, different numbers of grid lines in both the 
X– and Y– direction are employed to ensure that the 
solution is grid independent.  The differences in U, V 
and θ at all grid points obtained from the 100 × 300 and 
150 × 450 grid systems are less than 1% for a typical 
case with Pr = 0.7, Re = 500, Hb = 0.15, Wb = 1.5, De = 
1, Da = Df = 0.5, Sb = 1, Sl = 0.1, Su = Sp = 0.25, Hp = 
0.05, Kbf  =  Kpf  = 100.  Therefore the 100 × 300 
grid system is chosen in the computation of the various 
cases to be presented.  In addition, because of the 
elliptic nature of the present problem, it is necessary to 
make sure that the boundary conditions at X → ∞ given 
by equation (8) do not artificially constrain the solution. 
To ensure that the results are not affected by the 
longitudinal size of the computation domain, tests are 
performed by varying the longitudinal size of the from 
computation length downstream the trailing edge of 
board Lc. The difference in the average Nusselt 
numbers between Lc = 30 and Lc = 50 are within 0.4%. 
Thus, in all the subsequent numerical simulation the 
computation domain with Lc = 30 is used to simulate the 
very long channel. Secondly, the results for the limiting 
situation with long, parallel boards and without the 
effects of thermal interactions among the boards are 
compared to the relevant literatures.  Good agreement 
is found between the present predictions and the results 
presented by Davalath and Bayazitoglu [7]. Through 
these program tests the proposed numerical scheme is 
considered to be appropriate for the present problem 
under investigation. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Inspection of the forgoing analysis indicates that the flow 
and heat transfer characteristics in the present system 
depend on 14 parameters. Since a vast number of 
governing dimensionless parameters are required to 
characterize the system, a comprehensive analysis of all 
combinations of problems is not practical. The main 
objective here is to present a sample of results that 
illustrates the effects of the flow and thermal interactions 
among the sub-streams through the conducting boards 
on the heat transfer characteristics of heat generating 
blocks mounted on short boards in a channel. While 
computation can be performed with any combination, 
the effects of Kpf , Kbf , Hb, Sb and Re are investigated 
in this work. In particular, air ( Pr = 0.7 ) flowing through 
the channel with Wb = 1.5, De = 1, Da = Df = 0.5, Sl = 
0.1, Su = Sp = 0.25 and Hp = 0.05 is considered. The 
results are presented for the cases with Kpf  varying 
from 0 to 200, Kbf from 100 to 200, Hb from 0.05 to 0.15, 
Sb from 0.5 to 2.5 and Re from 200 to 1000. 
Initially, the flow structure in the channel is examined. 
The effects of the block height on the distribution of 
streamlines for the system with Sb = 1.5 and Re = 500 
are portrayed in Figure 2. The results in Figure 2(a) for 
the case with small block height Hb = 0.05 show that 
weak  recirculation cells appears in each gap between 
the blocks and behind the last block. However the cells 
are very close to the rear surface of block. The results 
are different to those reported by Davalath and 
Bayazitoglu [7], and Kim et al. [9] . Because the spacing 
between the blocks is much larger than the block height 
in this study. It is interesting to observe that the 
streamline apparently distort in the region near the 
leading edges of board when the flow approaches the 
blocks. The distortion is more evident at the location 
vicinity to the low board. The streamlines near the 
bottom channel wall are distorted upward. For the case 
with large block height Hb = 0.15, the results in Figure 
2(b) indicate that the primary recirculation cells in the 
gaps between the blocks and behind the last blocks are 
rather strong. The streamlines near the bottom channel 
wall distort downward in front of the leading edge of low 
board, which is different to that plotted in Figure 2(a). In 
addition a large recirculation zone is appeared in the 
region behind the up board. The phenomena are 
different to those presented in references [7] and [9] for 
the situation with boards having very long length from 
the last block to the trailing edges of boards. An overall 
inspection on Figures 2(a) – 2 (b) reveals that the 
channel wall, and the leading and trailing edges of the 
boards can significantly affect the flow structures. 
Figure 3 illustrate the effects of Kpf  and Hb on the 
temperature distributions for the system with  fixed  
Kbf = 100, Sb=1.5 and Re = 500.  For the limiting case 
with insulated board Kpf = 0, the results shown in Figure

Attention is now turned to investigate the variations of 
local Nusselt numbers along the front, top and rear 
surfaces of the first to fifth blocks mounted on different 
boards. For the limiting case with insulated boards, the 
results in Figure 4 show that the differences in the Nu’s 
among different boards are negligible small. For a given 
block, the maximum heat transfer coefficient occurs at 
the front top corner of block. The Nusselt numbers for 
rear surfaces are substantially smaller than those for  
front surfaces of blocks. This is due to the fact that the 
recirculation cells in the gaps between the blocks and 
behined the last blocks are very close to the rear 
surfaces of blocks. It is also mentioned that the Nu’s for

the top surfaces slightly increase at the positions near 
the rear top corners of blocks. This can be reasonably 
explained as that the sub-streams turn to flow downward 
into the gaps when they pass the rear top corners of 
blocks. For the case with conducting boards Kpf =100, it 
can be clearly seen in Figure 5 that the Nu’s for the up 
board are significantly higher than those for the middle 
and low boards, except the first blocks. However the 
Nu’s for the middle and low boards are very close. A 
comparison on the results in Figure 5 and 6 indicates 
that the differences in Nu’s among the boards become 
more evident for the case with larger Hb. Again these 
behaviors reveal that the thermal interactions among the 
conducting boards would play an important role on the 
heat transfer behaviors of a system containing 
multi-boards mounted with heat generating blocks. It is 
interesting to note in Figure 6 that the Nu’s for the top 
surfaces drastically drop with X in the region near the 
front top corners. But they turn to rise until the location 
about at 0.2 of block length. This is due to the fact that, 
for the case with large Hb, the sub-streams turn to flow 
toward the top surfaces of blocks when they pass over 
the front top corners of blocks. 
The maximum temperature in the system is important to 
the performance of thermal system. Finally the 
maximum temperatures in the last blocks mounted on 
different boards are presented, and the effects of 
thermal interactions among the boards on variations of 
the maximum temperatures are discussed. Table 1

characteristics are rigorously examined for the cases 
with various block height Hb, block spacing Sb, heat 
conductivity ratio of block to fluid Kbf, heat conductivity 
ratio of board to fluid Kpf, and Reynolds number Re. 
Results show that, owing to the effects of channel wall 
and thermal interaction among the sub-streams of fluid 
through the conducting boards, the differences in 
transfer characteristics among the blocks mounted on 
different boards are rather significant. The difference are 
more evident for the cases with larger Kbf, Kpf and Sb. 
The trend is inverse for the change of Hb and Re. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Convective heat transfer from block heat sources to 
forced stream is widely encountered in engineering 
applications, such as in the cooling of electronic system, 
solar collectors, furnace and chemical processing 
equipments.  Over the years, a lot of researchers have 
contributed their efforts to investigate the characteristics 
of forced convective flows over block heat sources.  
However, these reports mainly investigated the systems 
with blocks mounted on a single board.  The articles on 
the system containing multi-boards mounted with block 
heat sources are still rather limit.  Besides, most 
published work assumed that the sub-streams passing 
through each board had the same flow and thermal 
behaviors.  Meanwhile the thermally-periodic boundary 
condition was imposed on the two successive boards.  
Therefore the results did not illustrate the difference in 
the heat transfer characteristics for blocks mounted on 
different boards, which would be not applicable for the 
system with a small number of boards.  The main 
objective of this study is to rigorously examine the flow 
and thermal characteristics of each sub-stream in a 
channel containing multi-boards mounted with heat 
generating blocks, and the influences of thermal 
interactions among the sub-streams of fluid through the 
conducting boards.  Great attention is focused on the 
differences in the heat transfer behaviors of the blocks 
mounted on different boards. 
Because of its frequent occurrence in the industrial 
applications, the convective heat transfer from heated 
blocks have been studied by numerous researchers in 
the past two decades.  Due to the space limitation, only 
a brief review of the previous literature is presented 
below. Kang et al. [1] , and Nakayama and Park [2] 
experimentally examined the effects of block height and 
wall conduction on the heat convection for air flow over a 
two-dimensional, isolated block heat source mounted on 
plate. An experiment has been carried out by Nakamura 
and Igarashi [3] to investigate the forced convection 
heat transfer from a low-profile block placed in a 
rectangular duct. Kim and Kang [4] examined the 
characteristics of heat transfer from two heated blocks in 
a channel with pulsating the flow at the channel inlet. 
Lehmann and Wirtz [5], and Agonafer and Moffatt [6] 
experimentally and numerically investigated the 
characteristics of flows over an array of two-dimensional, 
rectangular components mounted on channel wall.  
Heat was applied to the top surface of one component.  
It was found that the variation of heat transfer coefficient 
along the heated surface is rather different to that for 
smooth channel wall. Davalath and Bayazitoglu [7] 
numerically predicted the behaviors of forced convection 
between parallel plates mounted with two-dimensional 
multiple blocks.  Results indicated that the heat flux 
distributions at the rear surfaces of blocks are much 
smaller than those at the front and top surfaces.  Kim 
and Anand [8] conducted the heat transfer between a 
series of parallel plates with surface-mounted discrete 
heat sources.  The repeated boundary conditions were 
imposed both in the cross-stream and stream wise 
directions in the study.  An analysis of heat transfer 
from rectangular heated block mounted on vertical and 
horizontal channel walls was carried out by Kim et al. [9].  
They mentioned that the impact of buoyancy effect on 
the flow and thermal fields is more pronounced for the 
vertically oriented channel.  Sparrow et al. [10] 
presented an experiment on heat transfer and pressure 
drop for air flow in arrays of heat generating modules 
deployed along one wall of a flat rectangular duct by 
using the naphthalene sublimation technique.  The 
effects of missing elements, height difference between 
modules and implanted barriers were investigated.  
Asako and Faghri [11, 12] performed a 
three-dimensional analysis for laminar flow through an 
array of heated square blocks.  Their results illustrated 
that the local heat flux on the top surface of block is 
higher than those on the front, side and rear surfaces.  
In addition, the Nusselt number decreases with the 
increasing block height and gradually approaches an 
asymptotic value.  An experimental study on the 
convective heat transfer for water cooling of inline and 
staggered arrays of protruding elements has been 
reported by Garimella and Eibeck [13].  It was 
concluded that staggering the elements of the arrays 
could significantly enhance the heat transfer coefficient. 
Wong and Peck [14] performed an experiment to 
investigate the effect of altitude on the characteristic of 
heat transfer from blocks to air stream. Furukawa and 
Yang [15] numerically investigated the thermal-fluid flow 
behaviors in a bundle of parallel boards with heat 
producing blocks.

SOLUTION METHOD  
The governing equations (1) - (6) and boundary 
conditions (7) – (12) are solved by a numerical scheme 
derived from the SIMPLER algorithm. The finite 
difference equations for P, U, V and θ are obtained by  
integrating the respective continuity, X-momentum, 
Y-momentum and energy equations over the control 
volumes via a power-law scheme. To obtain enhanced 
accuracy, nonuniform grids are arranged in the 
computational domain. The grid density is higher in the 
vicinity of the boards and heat generating blocks to 
capture the drastic variations of the flow and thermal 
fields. The line-by-line method with iteration is employed 
to solve the systems of algebraic equations obtained 
from discretizing the pressure, momentum and energy 
equations. The solution is considered to be converged 
when the relative differences of U, V, and θ at each node 
between two consecutive iterations, as well as the 
overall energy imbalance of the system are less than a 
prescribed value of 10-4. 
The proposed numerical algorithm is validated in two 
ways.  First, different numbers of grid lines in both the 
X– and Y– direction are employed to ensure that the 
solution is grid independent.  The differences in U, V 
and θ at all grid points obtained from the 100 × 300 and 
150 × 450 grid systems are less than 1% for a typical 
case with Pr = 0.7, Re = 500, Hb = 0.15, Wb = 1.5, De = 
1, Da = Df = 0.5, Sb = 1, Sl = 0.1, Su = Sp = 0.25, Hp = 
0.05, Kbf  =  Kpf  = 100.  Therefore the 100 × 300 
grid system is chosen in the computation of the various 
cases to be presented.  In addition, because of the 
elliptic nature of the present problem, it is necessary to 
make sure that the boundary conditions at X → ∞ given 
by equation (8) do not artificially constrain the solution. 
To ensure that the results are not affected by the 
longitudinal size of the computation domain, tests are 
performed by varying the longitudinal size of the from 
computation length downstream the trailing edge of 
board Lc. The difference in the average Nusselt 
numbers between Lc = 30 and Lc = 50 are within 0.4%. 
Thus, in all the subsequent numerical simulation the 
computation domain with Lc = 30 is used to simulate the 
very long channel. Secondly, the results for the limiting 
situation with long, parallel boards and without the 
effects of thermal interactions among the boards are 
compared to the relevant literatures.  Good agreement 
is found between the present predictions and the results 
presented by Davalath and Bayazitoglu [7]. Through 
these program tests the proposed numerical scheme is 
considered to be appropriate for the present problem 
under investigation. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Inspection of the forgoing analysis indicates that the flow 
and heat transfer characteristics in the present system 
depend on 14 parameters. Since a vast number of 
governing dimensionless parameters are required to 
characterize the system, a comprehensive analysis of all 
combinations of problems is not practical. The main 
objective here is to present a sample of results that 
illustrates the effects of the flow and thermal interactions 
among the sub-streams through the conducting boards 
on the heat transfer characteristics of heat generating 
blocks mounted on short boards in a channel. While 
computation can be performed with any combination, 
the effects of Kpf , Kbf , Hb, Sb and Re are investigated 
in this work. In particular, air ( Pr = 0.7 ) flowing through 
the channel with Wb = 1.5, De = 1, Da = Df = 0.5, Sl = 
0.1, Su = Sp = 0.25 and Hp = 0.05 is considered. The 
results are presented for the cases with Kpf  varying 
from 0 to 200, Kbf from 100 to 200, Hb from 0.05 to 0.15, 
Sb from 0.5 to 2.5 and Re from 200 to 1000. 
Initially, the flow structure in the channel is examined. 
The effects of the block height on the distribution of 
streamlines for the system with Sb = 1.5 and Re = 500 
are portrayed in Figure 2. The results in Figure 2(a) for 
the case with small block height Hb = 0.05 show that 
weak  recirculation cells appears in each gap between 
the blocks and behind the last block. However the cells 
are very close to the rear surface of block. The results 
are different to those reported by Davalath and 
Bayazitoglu [7], and Kim et al. [9] . Because the spacing 
between the blocks is much larger than the block height 
in this study. It is interesting to observe that the 
streamline apparently distort in the region near the 
leading edges of board when the flow approaches the 
blocks. The distortion is more evident at the location 
vicinity to the low board. The streamlines near the 
bottom channel wall are distorted upward. For the case 
with large block height Hb = 0.15, the results in Figure 
2(b) indicate that the primary recirculation cells in the 
gaps between the blocks and behind the last blocks are 
rather strong. The streamlines near the bottom channel 
wall distort downward in front of the leading edge of low 
board, which is different to that plotted in Figure 2(a). In 
addition a large recirculation zone is appeared in the 
region behind the up board. The phenomena are 
different to those presented in references [7] and [9] for 
the situation with boards having very long length from 
the last block to the trailing edges of boards. An overall 
inspection on Figures 2(a) – 2 (b) reveals that the

the thermal boundary layers along the adjacent boards 
can merge in the upstream regions of the sub-channels.  
Thus the treatment of thermally-periodic conditions 
adopted in the previous literature might be not practical 
in some engineering applications. 
 
Attention is now turned to investigate the variations of 
local Nusselt numbers along the front, top and rear 
surfaces of the first to fifth blocks mounted on different 
boards. For the limiting case with insulated boards, the 
results in Figure 4 show that the differences in the Nu’s 
among different boards are negligible small. For a given 
block, the maximum heat transfer coefficient occurs at 
the front top corner of block. The Nusselt numbers for 
rear surfaces are substantially smaller than those for  
front surfaces of blocks. This is due to the fact that the 
recirculation cells in the gaps between the blocks and 
behined the last blocks are very close to the rear 
surfaces of blocks. It is also mentioned that the Nu’s for

the top surfaces slightly increase at the positions near 
the rear top corners of blocks. This can be reasonably 
explained as that the sub-streams turn to flow downward 
into the gaps when they pass the rear top corners of 
blocks. For the case with conducting boards Kpf =100, it 
can be clearly seen in Figure 5 that the Nu’s for the up 
board are significantly higher than those for the middle 
and low boards, except the first blocks. However the 
Nu’s for the middle and low boards are very close. A 
comparison on the results in Figure 5 and 6 indicates 
that the differences in Nu’s among the boards become 
more evident for the case with larger Hb. Again these 
behaviors reveal that the thermal interactions among the 
conducting boards would play an important role on the 
heat transfer behaviors of a system containing 
multi-boards mounted with heat generating blocks. It is 
interesting to note in Figure 6 that the Nu’s for the top 
surfaces drastically drop with X in the region near the 
front top corners. But they turn to rise until the location 
about at 0.2 of block length. This is due to the fact that, 
for the case with large Hb, the sub-streams turn to flow 
toward the top surfaces of blocks when they pass over 
the front top corners of blocks. 
The maximum temperature in the system is important to 
the performance of thermal system. Finally the 
maximum temperatures in the last blocks mounted on 
different boards are presented, and the effects of 
thermal interactions among the boards on variations of 
the maximum temperatures are discussed. Table 1
