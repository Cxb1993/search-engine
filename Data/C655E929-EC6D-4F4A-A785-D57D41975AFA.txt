本研究利用熱機處理來製備具不同預應變之三種鋅鋁合金，包括微雙相鋅-22 wt.% 
鋁及擬單相之鋅-95 wt.% 鋁(α相)與鋅-1 wt.% 鋁(β相)，探討其是否及如何發生加工軟
化行為與退火硬化行為。藉由 DSC、微硬度、及壓縮測試，並且配合 SEM微觀組織之
觀察，探討三種合金內之 α相與 β相之微觀結構與加工軟化及退火硬化的關係。研究結
果顯示，在-10℃至 250℃之溫度區間含大量 β相之鋅鋁合金會出現加工軟化之現象，而
軟化後之鋅鋁合金在後續高溫退火時會出現退火硬化之現象。由實驗結果分析得知，加
工軟化之機構乃是熱加工時之動態再結晶(DRX)所導致之軟化行為，而具備高角度晶界
之極細 β相晶粒可促進動態再結晶，而加強加工軟化之效果。另一方面，退火硬化之機
構則是藉由退火來粗化這些極細 β相晶粒，阻礙動態再結晶所導致之軟化，回復材料正
常強度。 
為進一步驗證加工軟化與退火硬化對鋅鋁合金之應力-應變行為，本研究針對壓縮
實驗所得結果提出一「複合應力-應變圖形」模型來解析鋅-22 wt.% 鋁合金內所發生之
結構變化，對應於此「複合應力-應變圖形」，鋅鋁合金內 β相所發生之塑性變形行為、
動態再結晶(應變軟化)行為與粗化(退火硬化)均得以清楚辨別。

Experimental procedures 
 
 The Zn-1wt.% Al, Zn-22 wt.% Al, and Zn-95 wt.% Al alloy used in this study were 
prepared by melting proper amounts of 99.7% purity Al and 99.99% purity Zn in a graphite 
crucible in air and casting into 450 × 300 × 35 mm blocks. These castings were homogenized 
at 380℃ for 48 hours and hot rolled to various designated thicknesses, followed by a 
thermomechanical treatment as described in the following section for work softening and 
anneal hardening studies. 
For work softening study, the thermomechanical treatment applied to the Zn-22 wt.% Al 
alloy plates of various thickness consists of (i) solid solution treatment at 380℃ for 1 hour, 
quench into a -10℃ aqueous bath (a mixture of water and anti-freezer coolant); (ii) aging at 
-10℃ for 24 hours, then these plates was further grain coarsened at 200  for 24 hours℃ ; and 
(iii) pre-straining of the Zn-Al alloy plates by mechanical rolling at -10  at ℃ selected reduction 
thickness of 0%, 30%, and 60%. For anneal hardening study, selected pre-strained Zn-Al alloy 
specimens were isothermal annealed at 25  and 250  for various time spans up to 24 hours.℃ ℃

“strain softening” and the grain coarsening-induced “anneal hardening” can be disclosed. 
Accordingly, various types of elevated temperature flow curve in the dual-phase Zn-22 wt.％ 
Al alloy can be constructed by the overlap of (i) a typical S-S curve of fine grained β phase 
and (ii) a deferred grain coarsening-induced hardening of β phase to form a composite S-S 
curve. Schematic diagrams showing the construction of various types of composite S-S curve 
in pre-strained dual-phase Zn-22 wt.％ Al alloy compression tested at 250  under initial ℃
strain rates of 1×10-2 and 1×10-3 s-1 are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. The 
experimental S-S curves shown in Fig. 6 can serve as examples to resolve detailed 
information of microstructure changes occurring in the process of compression. 
According to the composite S-S curve concept an oscillatory flow curve of β phase and a 
grain coarsening induced hardening of ultra-fine grains can be deduced from the experimental 
S-S curves shown in Fig. 6. From the deduced oscillatory flow curves of β phase the critical 
strain to initiate recrystallization εC and the strain required to complete a localized 
recrystallization εx can be calculated. It is considered that a combination of small εC and εx 
values
 
and a large εon-set value can effectively assist the formation of a fine recrystallized grain 
structure of β phase in the dual-phase Zn-22 wt.% Al alloy during elevated temperature 
deformation, which is beneficial to the superplasticity in the dual-phase Zn-Al alloy. Since 
these εC and εx and εon-set are affected by factors such as test temperature, strain rate, initial 
grain size and the pre-strain history, proper manipulations on these factors may defer the grain 
coarsening-induced hardening and consequently enhance the superplasticity in the Zn-22 wt.
％ Al alloy.
