Abstract 
This work illustrates the compact heat sink simulations in forced convection flow with 
side-bypass effect. Conventionally, the numerical study of the fluid flow and heat transfer in 
finned heat sinks employs the detailed model. It will spend a lot of computational time. Therefore, 
some investigators begin to numerically study such problem by using the compact model (i.e. the 
porous approach) since the regularly arranged fin array can be set as a porous medium. The 
computations of the porous approach model will be faster than those of the detailed mode due to 
the assumption of the volume-averaging technique. This work uses the Brinkman-Forchheimer 
model for fluid flow and two-equation model for heat transfer. A configuration of in-line square 
pin-fin heat sink situated in a rectangular channel with fixed height (H=23.7 mm), various width 
and two equal-spacing bypass passengers beside the heat sink is successfully studied. The pin-fin 
arrays with various porosities (ε=0.358-0.750) and numbers of pin-fins (n=25-81), confined 
within a square spreader whose side length (L) is 67 mm, are employed. The numerical results 
suggest that, within the range of present studied parameters (0.358≤ε≤0.750, 25≤n≤81 and 
1≤W/L≤5), the pin-fin heat sink with ε=0.750 and n=25 is the optimal cooling configuration 
based on the maximum ratio of Nusselt number to dimensionless pumping power (Nu/(∆P×Re3)). 
Besides, based on medium Nu/(∆P×Re3) value and suitable channel size, W/L=2-3 is suggested as 
the better size ratio of channel to heat sink.

1. Introduction 
Given their inexpensive and simple structure, pin-fins have extensive applications. 
Applications of pin-fins in the cooling configuration of a channel with cross flow include the 
internal cooling of turbine blades, the cooling of electronic components and various other heat 
exchange devices. The affecting factors on the thermal performance of such systems include the 
velocity of fluid flow, the thermal properties of the fluid and the pin-fins, the relative fin height, 
the cross-sectional shape of the pin-fins, the relative inter-fin pitch, the arrangement of the 
pin-fins and the bypass effect. Many researchers have considered the effects of the 
aforementioned parameters on heat transfer of pin-fins. However, most of the studies focused on 
the bypass effect have the configuration with the top shroud clearance above the pin-fin array

thermal characteristics for a square pin-fin channel flow, by applying the non-Darcian model and 
two-equation model. Kim et al [15] modifies the method of You and Chang [13, 14] to model the 
pin-fin heat sink as a porous medium. Recently, Jeng and Tzeng [16] presented a novel 
semi-empirical model for estimating the permeability and inertial coefficient of pin-fin heat sinks. 
The forms of correlations for the permeability and inertial coefficient of pin-fin heat sinks were 
firstly derived theoretically, then a series of pressure drop tests were performed for modifying 
those correlations. The above studies contribute to compact model simulation of the pin-fin heat 
sink in the convection flow. 
This work illustrates the compact heat sink simulations in forced convection flow with 
side-bypass effect. The Brinkman-Forchheimer model is used for fluid flow and two-equation 
model for heat transfer. A configuration of in-line square pin-fin heat sink situated in a 
rectangular channel with fixed height (H=23.7 mm), various width (W) and two equal-spacing 
bypass passengers beside the heat sink is successfully studied. The pin-fin arrays with various 
porosities (ε=0.358-0.750) and numbers of pin-fins (n=25-81), confined within a square spreader 
whose side length (L) is 67 mm, are employed. In the present investigation the basic interaction 
phenomena between the pin-fin heat sink and the fluid region within the channel have been 
analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of various parameters, such as the porosity (ε), the number of 
pin-fins (n) and the wide size proportion of the channel to the heat sink (W/L), on the fluid flow 
and heat transfer are analyzed. 
 
2. Numerical Model 
2.1 Governing equations 
Figure 2 is a physical configuration, which sets the regularly arranged pin-fins as porous 
media. The heat flux is firstly transmitted upwards from the paper surface through the pin-fins by 
heat conduction, and then transmitted to the air passing through the heat sink from the extended 
surface of the pin-fins by heat convection. If the end-wall effect at bottom of the pin-fin is 
neglected, the heat dissipation from pin-fins will be the heat generated in the porous media of 
pin-fins. Therefore, the present study can be simplified to be two-dimensional problem. Other 
assumptions are as follows: 1. the porous medium is homogenous and isotropic; 2. the fluid flow 
is steady state, laminar and incompressible; 3. the thermophysical properties of the fluid and 
porous media do not depend on temperature. Besides, using the following dimensionless

( )82934.0Re04433.0 dffs dkh ε=      for Red≥1000 (8) 
where Red is defined as ρfumaxd/µ; umax is the average maximum velocity between pin-fins, and d 
is the pin-fin thickness.  
2.2 Boundary conditions 
Figure 3 schematically depicts the numerical domain and the boundary conditions.  Roache 
[18] elucidated the boundary conditions of the vorticity-transport equation. The temperature 
gradients of the solid phase and the fluid phase along the Y-direction are zero on the insulated and 
symmetric faces. The fluid is assumed to enter the inlet with a uniform temperature (Ti) and a 
uniform velocity (ui). The fluid phase at the exit is assumed to meet the zero diffusion condition 
since the downstream length Lout (=20L) is chosen to be sufficiently long.  
Besides, the interfacial boundary condition plays very important roles in the porous/fluid 
composite system. This is due to the abrupt change of thermophysical properties, such as the 
permeability, inertial coefficient and porosity, across the interface. The harmonic mean formulation 
recommended by Patankar [19] is used to treat these discontinuous characteristics at the 
porous/fluid surface. Moreover, Huang and Vafai [20] suggested a modified governing equation 
used across the interface, instead of the Eq. (4), since where the permeability, inertial coefficient 
and porosity were not constants any more. This modified governing equation for the interfacial 
region is employed in the present study and its details can be found in Huang and Vafai [20]. 
Therefore, the single-domain approach can be performed in the present simulations and the 
continuity of the convection and diffusive fluxes across the interface will be automatically satisfied. 
2.3 Numerical procedure and data reduction 
This work applies the power-law developed by Patankar [19] to disperse the equations and 
employs the SIS (Strong Implicit Solver) algorithm proposed by Lee [21] to solve the related 
dispersal equations. The numerical procedure initially resolves the vorticity and the stream 
function, and then applies the vorticity and the stream function to resolve the velocity field, which 
is subsequently substituted into the fluid energy equation. Additionally, the solid and fluid energy 
equations are solved and then the solid and fluid temperature fields are obtained. All of the 
resolutions undergo the grid test and convergent test. The large variations in the W/L value 
(W/L=1-5) are such that grid systems are separated into various classes to fit the physical model. 
The grid points, in an X-Y coordinate, are 481×21, 481×31, 481×41, 481×51 and 481×61, 
respectively. The grid size falls as W/L value decreases. The iteration ends when the variables meet 
the criterion,

where F represents Ψ, ω or θ. The subscripts i and j refer to the ith and the jth grid-cells in the X 
and Y directions, respectively. The superscript n indicates the nth iteration. 
The major parameters of heat transfer performance observed herein are the Reynolds number 
(Re), the dimensionless pressure drop (∆P) and the average Nusselt number (Nu), which are 
 
 
7
Hence, a better evaluation shall be based on maximum ratio of average Nusselt number to 
dimensionless pumping power. Here, a new parameter Nu/(∆P×Re3) representing the ratio of heat 
transfer performance to pumping power is introduced. When this value is larger, it shows that, in 
the said cooling model (ε, n, W/L), each pumping power will have higher cooling effect. Figure 6 
shows the Nu/(∆P×Re3) as a function of W/L for various n values and porosities (ε). The results 
show that increase of W/L will lead to increase of Nu/(∆P×Re3), in particular, when W/L=1-2, 
Nu/(∆P×Re3) has a very obvious increase rate along with W/L, while when W/L=3-5, Nu/(∆P×Re3) 
has a less obvious increase rate along with W/L. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6(a), when ε=0.750, 
the n value has a medium impact on Nu/(∆P×Re3). In cases with n=25, the Nu/(∆P×Re3) is 
14.5%-18.8% higher than those with n=81. However, Fig. 6(b) shows when n=81, porosity (ε) 
has a considerable impact on Nu/(∆P×Re3). Nu/(∆P×Re3) greatly increases along with the 
increase of porosity (ε). To sum up, within the range of present studied parameters 
(0.358≤ε≤0.750, 25≤n≤81 and 1≤W/L≤5), the pin-fin heat sink with ε=0.750 and n=25 is the 
optimal cooling configuration, which has a larger Nu/(∆P×Re3) value. Moreover, based on 
medium Nu/(∆P×Re3) value and suitable channel size, it is suggested that W/L=2-3 is the better 
size ratio of channel to heat sink.
