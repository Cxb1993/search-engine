I. INTRODUCTION
Networked control systems (NCSs) have re-
ceived much attention in the past years because
of their applicability to complex systems, such
as advanced aircraft, spacecraft, and manufac-
turing processes, as well as having many ad-
vantages in practical applications, e.g., increased
system flexibility, benefits from sharing of the
resources, low cost, and simpler installation and
maintenance [1], [2]. However, many emerged
problems of an NCS, such as network-induced
delay (sensor-to-controller delay and controller-
to-actuator delay) and missing measurements
(packet dropout), are needed to be solved; see,
e.g., [3]-[6] and references therein.
One of the main issues in NCSs is network-
induced delays, which can deteriorate control
system performance, and may even cause system
instability. Therefore, various approaches for the
delay issue in NCSs have been presented in
the literature; see [1] and [7]-[8]. In this report,
the considered network-induced delay model is
an extended version of the one given in [9] as
suggested by [1]. Hence, we consider the NCS
whose network-induced delay is longer than a
sampling period, the sensor is time driven, and
the controller is event driven. Another important
issue in NCSs is the missing measurements
problem, which is also known as one of the
major causes of deterioration in system per-
formance. There are many approaches to han-
dle this kind of problem, e.g., the stochastic
system approach [10] and the switched system
approach [2]. In this report, we adopt the missing
measurements model of [2] to use a switch
to denote the state of the sensor-to-controller
channel. When the switch is closed, the measure-
ment output is successfully transmitted to the
controller; whereas when the switch is open, the
measurement output is held at the previous value
and the missing measurement phenomenon is
happened.
System component failures may also be a
critical problem in sophisticated control system
design, especially for those high safety critical
systems, e.g., aircraft and space craft. Hence,
reliable controller designs guaranteeing stabil-
ity while permitting control component failures
(e.g., actuator failures and/or sensor failures)
have received great attentions in the literature
[11]-[15]. Moreover, for most practical systems,
the system model is always subject to uncertain-
ties. In this project, we shall study the reliable
control design problem for discrete-time NCSs
which are subject to parametric uncertainties
and actuator failures in the framework of linear
quadratic regulator (LQR) design method [16]-
[18].
It is often impossible and/or impractical to
get full state information. A common approach
to solve this problem is to derive the opti-
mal filter, e.g. the Kalman filter, to estimate
the unavailable state. This has motivated the
develop of output feedback control law. State
estimation with unknown inputs or bias has
received considerable attention during the last
decades. It is known that the optimal filtering for
systems with unknown inputs that have arbitrary
statistics and affect both the system model and
the measurements has played a significant role
in many applications, e.g., geophysical and en-
vironmental applications and fault detection and
isolation problems. There are many approaches
in the literature to solve this kind of problem,
e.g., the unbiased minimum-variance estimation
[19], [21], [22], [23], the equivalent system
description method [20], the state estimation
techniques for descriptor systems [24], and the
parameterized minimum-variance filtering [25].
In this paper, we shall show how to apply the
above parameterized minimum-variance filtering
to solve the NCS that has incurred parametric
uncertainty problems.
Putting all the aforementioned issues into
consideration has motivated this research to de-
sign the filter-based output feedback LQ reliable
control for networked control systems that with
long time delays, missing measurements, actua-
tor failures, and parametric uncertainties.
This report is organized as follows. In Section
II, the statement of the problem is addressed.
Section III presents the design of the robust LQ
reliable control of the networked control system
with full state information. The parameterized
minimum-variance filter design used for the
networked control system when the system has
partial state information is addressed in Section
IV. Then, the design of the output feedback
controller when the system has partial state

in which M , D1, D2, G¯, and D3 are known ma-
trices, while ∆k and ∆¯k are unknown matrices
satisfying
∆′k∆k ≤ I, ∆¯′k∆¯k ≤ I. (16)
The problem of interest in this report is to
design a controller that subject to system (8)
and (13)-(14) and minimizes the following cost
function supposing that wk = 0 and vk = 0:

where Qi = Q′i ≥ 0 and R = R′ > 0. Note that
(17) can be reformulated, using the augmented
state, as follows:

III. ROBUST LINEAR QUADRATIC
RELIABLE CONTROL DESIGN VIA STATE
FEEDBACK
When the system has full state information,
i.e., xak is perfectly known, using wk = 0 and
(4) in (13) yields
xak+1 = (Φk +∆Φk)x
a
k + (Γk +∆Γk)Nku¯k.(20)
In this section, we consider the robust linear
quadratic reliable control (RLQRC), or the re-
silient guaranteed cost control (RGCC), design
problem (see [18] for details).
Motivated by the work of [17], the RLQRC
that minimizes cost function (18) subject to
system (20) can be obtained as follows:
u¯k = −
(
I + (RkaTk)
−1T¯k
)−1
S−1k
× (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/ε)D′2D1)xak(21)
where
Tk = (S
−1
k −Rka)−1 (22)
T¯k = diag{δ21, δ22, · · · , δ2m} (23)
Sk = Γ

− (Φ′kPk+1Γk + (1/ε)D′1D2)

(
Sk + (I − T¯k)−1(Rka)−1T¯k
)−1
× (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/ε)D′2D1) (25)
Q˜k = Q¯1 + (1/ε)D
′
1D1 + Pk+1M
×((I/ε) +M ′Pk+1M)−1M ′Pk+1(26)
in which PN = Q¯0, Rka is a diagonal matrix such
that 0 < Rka < S
−1
k , and ε satisfies the following
relationship
εM ′
(
P−1k+1 + εMM
′)−1M < I. (27)
Note that if system (20) does not suffer ac-
tuator failure problem, i.e., Nk = I , then one
has T¯k = 0, and hence the RLQRC become the
following guaranteed cost control (GCC) [16]:
u¯k = −S−1k (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/ε)D′2D1) xak (28)
where
Pk = Φ
′
kPk+1Φk + Q˜k
− (Φ′kPk+1Γk + (1/ε)D′1D2)
×S−1k (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/ε)D′2D1) .(29)
Furthermore, if one considers the normal system
of (20), then the above GCC will reduce to
the stochastic optimal state feedback control [1],
which can be rewritten as follows:
u¯k = −S−1k Γ′kPk+1Φkxak (30)
where
Sk = Γ

kPk+1Γk + R¯ (31)
Pk = Φ

Remark 1: The proposed PMVF is character-
ized by two design parameters: Fk and Gk. If
one chooses Fk = Fk and Gk = Gk, then the
obtained PMVF will be equivalent to the optimal
estimator filter [22]. Howerver, if one chooses
Fk = 0 and Gk = 0, then the obtained PMVF,
on the other hand, will be equivalent to the well-
known Kalman filter.
In the following, we intend to show that the
above PMVF may be seen as an extension of the
optimal state estimator (OSE) presented in [1].
To achieve this aim, we choose
F = F = 0,G = G = 0, Nk = I, sk = 1. (67)
Using (67) in the PMVF yields
zˆk = (I −KkC¯)(Φ¯k−1zˆk−1 + Γ¯k−1uk−1)

where
Kk = P¯k−1C¯ ′(C¯P¯k−1C¯ ′ +W2)−1 (69)
