英文摘要 
The design of a frequency divider (FD) 
employing 3-dimensional (3-D) inductors 
fabricated in the 0.18-um 1P6M CMOS 
technology is reported. The FD consists of two 
single-ended complementary Colpitts oscillators 
coupled with capacitors to generate differential 
output signals. The aim of using 3D inductor is 
to reduce chip size. The divide-by-2 LC-tank 
injection-locked frequency divider is performed 
by adding an injection nMOS between the 
differential outputs of the divider. The 
measurement results show that at the supply 
voltage of 1.6V, the divider free-running 
frequency is tunable from 3.05 GHz to 3.52 GHz, 
and at the incident power of 0 dBm the locking 
range is about 2.9 GHz (43%), from the incident 
frequency 5.3 GHz to 8.2 GHz. The core power 
consumption is 7.14mW. The die area is 0.625 x 
0.672 mm2.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Frequency divider (FD) is widely used in 
h igh-speed sys tems such as  f requency 
synthesizers and used for quadrature signal 
generation.  The main concern for the frequency 
divider design is lower power consumption, wide 
locking range, high frequency capability, and low 
cost. High frequency dividers can be realized 
using common-mode logic (CML), dynamic 
logic, and Miller divider, or through the injection 
locked oscillators (ILO). Injection locked 
oscillators consume generally less power than 
CML or Miller dividers due to the tuned nature 
of the circuit, they are widely used to divide 
down high oscillation frequency [1,2,3,4]. The  
 4 
are coupled by two capacitors Cc, which force 
the two oscillators operate in a differential form. 
Fig. 1(b) shows the small-signal equivalent 
circuit without injection nMOS. In Fig. 1(b), gm 
(=gmp+ gmn) is the net transconductance due to 
the transistors Mn1 and Mp1. Cgs(=Cgsn+Cgsp) is 
the net gate-source capacitance due to the 
transistors Mn1 and Mp1. Cdb  (=Cdsp +Cdsn) is 
the net capacitance seen at the drain node of the 
transistors Mn1 and Mp1. Cv is the varactor  
capacitance. Mi is omitted in Fig. 1(b). 
Neglecting the current sources, applying 
Kirchhoff’s current law at nodes A and B in Fig.

The above equation indicates that we can 
change the capacitance value of the varactor by 
applying a tuning voltage to set the free-running 
oscillation frequency. The circuit shown in Fig. 
1(b) can be decomposed into two series tuned 
LC tanks connected in parallel with back to front  
by bi-setting the whole circuit into two half 
circuits along the nodes A and D. The 
differential VCO is composed of two 
single-ended Colpitts oscillators with two 
independent dc current paths. However, the 
operation principle is different from differential 
Colpitts oscillator, the LC resonator is a 
series-tuned rather than parallel-tuned. In the 
small-signal circuit model shown in Fig. 1(b), we

intentionally neglect the presence of dissipation 
parasitic resistor for simplicity, the loss due to 
the parasitic resistors is compensated by the 
voltage controlled current sources. When the 
coupling capacitance Cc is too small, the two 
Colpitts oscillators operate independently. As the 
Cc increases and is small, its role is to force the 
two single-ended Colpitts oscillators to operate 
in differential mode. When the effective coupling  
capacitance Cc is very large, the ac function of 
the circuit approximates that of a complementary 
cross-coupled LC tank oscillator, however the dc 
current paths of the proposed VCO and 
cross-coupled VCO are different.  
In Fig. 1(a), the drain and source of the 
injector MOS Mi are connected to the output 
nodes of the divider. The dc bias of injection 
MOS and its parasitic components can affect the 
frequency tuning curve. The injection 
mechanism is basically a direct injection 
technique proposed in [1]. The relationship 
between the ac injection signal and the ac 
outputs of ILFD is shown in Fig. 2. Under 
injection locked condition, the voltages at the 
two outputs are equalized at the maximum 
injection signal strength. Between the two peak 
injection signal voltages, there is one peak output  
voltage at the drain outputs, which thus oscillate 
by half of the injection cycles. Since the drain 
outputs of the transistor are forced to operate 
differentially by the coupling capacitor Cc, the

locking range from 5.3 to 8.2 GHz. The dc bias 
Vinj of injector’s gate is 1.1V. The current and 
power consumption of the core are 4.49 mA and 
7.14 mW respectively. Fig. 7 shows the 
measured phase noises of the injection signal and 
the injection-locked oscillator output in the 2÷  
mode. The phase noise of the injection-reference 
is -125 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. After applying 
an external power injection at -3 dBm, the output 
ILFD phase noise is about -134 dBc/Hz in the 
2÷  mode. The phase noise of free-running ILFD 
at 1MHz offset from the output oscillation 
frequency of 3.2 GHz is about -100 dBc/Hz. The 
phase noise of 2÷  ILFD is lower than that of the 
free-running oscillator by 34 dB. Fig. 8 shows 
the measured output spectra of the divider 
before and after the locked conditions in the 2÷  
mode. The locked output spectrum is sharper 
and shows a lower phase noise. Table I shows 
the comparison between the proposed injection- 
locked divider and previously published reports.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Fully integrated voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 
is one of the most challenging parts of radio 
transceiver to integrate in standard CMOS 
technologies, because many demanding design 
parameters of VCO are required, these  parameters 
are  large frequency tuning range, low power 
consumption, low cost and low phase noise. A wide 
tuning range is often important because it can 
accommodate more process and temperature 
variations. In this paper, we propose a low voltage 
and small chip area CMOS VCO circuit topology 
intended for increasing the performance of VCO. A 
helical inductor [2] is used because the area 
occupation of helical inductor is much smaller. In 
addition, smaller area occupation gives smaller 
substrate loss, so little performance degradation of 
the helical inductor over the planar spiral is expected. 
As the supply voltage decreases, the tuning range 
decreases because of smaller applied tuning voltage. 
To reduce VCO power consumption and phase noise, 
the tank inductance should be maximized [1], and a 
large varactor with high Cmax/Cmin ratio for a wider 
frequency tuning range is required, because the 
frequency of oscillation ω 0 of an LC tank VCO is 
determined by

where CV is the varactor capacitance and CFIX is the 
fixed parasitic capacitance due to the inductor layout 
and transistors necessary for the compensation of the 
loss in the resonator. As ω 0 is specified, this forces a 
minimization of the total tank capacitance.    
In the proposed VCO circuit, we use a concept of 
tapped LC tank [3] for reducing the effect of the 
parasitic capacitances of active transistors to increase 
the tuning range of VCO. The following text 
addresses the design concept and the details of the 
implemented VCO. 
II. DESIGN OF LOW-VOLTAGE WIDE-BAND VCO 
Firstly, the operation principle of a conventional 
singly cross-coupled LC VCO shown in Fig. 1 is 
reviewed.  An ideal LC oscillator is composed of an 
inductor and a capacitor. Ideally if the tank is lossless, 
the oscillator has no phase noise since the tank 
quality is infinite. Since practical LC tanks are lossy, 
a means providing negative resistance is required to

Fig. 3. The schematic of the proposed VCO. 
 
In the VCO circuit shown in Fig. 3, the transistors 
MN1 and MN2 are the cross-coupled pair and 
provide negative resistances for the VCO core to 
cancel the resistive loss in the LC tank circuit. The 
LC tanks include varactors, and tapped inductors (L1, 
L2, L3, and L4), and a tail transistor (MN3). The tail 
MOS transistor MN3 is used to optimize the power 
dissipation and phase noise. The capacitor C3 is used 
to reduce second-harmonics and reduce tail source 
noise up-conversion. In order to operate the oscillator 
at low supply voltage and to reduce the phase noise, a 
large output swing of the resonant tank is needed.  
The large output swing is applied to the gates of the 
cross-coupled transistors, so that the circuit can 
operate at low voltage.  The large voltage swing 
must be limited so that no degradation in gate oxide 
is induced.  One common drain stage is used as 
buffer. This buffer can directly drive the off-chip 
50ohm load. The only requirement for the buffer is 
that it should not load the oscillator excessively. 
Referring to Fig. 1, at low frequencies, the flicker 
noise in the switching drain currents sees a low 
impedance at its drain terminal [2], this impedance 
can be seen as a short, this will reduce the AM-PM 
phase noise. In the circuit shown in Fig. 3, a similar 
conclusion is applicable. Besides, the high frequency 
noise that comes from drain currents will see an 
inductor, which blocks the pass of the noise to 
modulate the varactor, therefore the conversion of 
low-frequency and high-frequency drain current 
noise to the phase noise can be minimized. 
To increase the VCO tuning range we must 
minimize the drain-source capacitance Cdb of 
switching pair by layout optimization. In addition, we 
can shift Cdb away from the paralleling with the 
varactors in LC resonator, this can be achieved using 
the tapped LC resonator as shown in Fig. 3, where 
the gates of nMOS cross-coupled transistors are 
connected to the terminals of the varactors, while the 
drain terminals of the switching MOS pairs are 
connected to the taps of the inductors. Simulation 
results indicate the tuning range increases using the 
tapped LC tanks. 
 
III. HELICAL INDUCTOR DESIGN 
Figure 4 shows a 3D view of a helical inductor 
using 4 top metal layers. The turn of the helical 
inductor is expanded vertically. Therefore, the 3D 
helical inductors have smaller occupation area 
compared with planar inductors. Port 1 is placed at 
the top metal (M6) while Port 3 is located in the 
bottom metal (M3) and Port 2 is designed with a tap 
points in the middle metal (M5) using the Agilent 
ADS Momentum EM simulator. The size of the 
inductor is 155x155 um2 and the inductance is 
designed to be 2nH. The tapped point is designed to

V. CONCLUSION 
A low voltage and wide tuning range 2.4GHz VCO 
employing  the  3D helical  inductors fabricated 
in the 0.18-um CMOS technology has been 
demonstrated, the VCO circuit uses the concept of 
inductor tapping to shift the parasitic drain-to-bulk 
junction capacitances of active switching MOSFET’s 
away from paralleling with the varactors. The fixed 
capacitance that affects the tuning range is reduced, 
therefore the tuning range is increased.  A 3D 
inductor reduces the chip occupied area and lowers 
chip cost. The implemented VCO core consumes 
power of 2.6mW at 1.0V supply voltage, and the 
measured phase noise is -116.8dBc/Hz at 1MHz 
offset from the oscillation frequency of 2.46GHz. 
And core consumes power of 5.85mW at 1.5V supply 
voltage, and the measured phase noise is 
-116.9dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset from the oscillation 
frequency of 2.53GHz. The present technique applies 
to a corresponding p-type cross-coupled VCO to 
achieve a lower phase noise VCO.
