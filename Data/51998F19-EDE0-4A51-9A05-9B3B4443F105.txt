intermetallics detached themselves in a massive scale 
during reflow or aging even though the wetting layer 
had not been depleted. Although the fact that massive 
spalling has been observed across several 
solder/substrate systems, a unified explanation to 
rationalize this behavior is still lacking. The major 
objective of this proposal is to investigate this 
rather peculiar but practically very important 
phenomenon. This Principle Investigator had proposed 
an explanation for the driving force for the massive 
spalling. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that 
the arguments presented there were purely 
thermodynamic in nature. Nothing is said about 
dynamically how massive spalling occurs. Such 
unknowns include, for example, (a) how can the entire 
intermetallic layer detach itself from the interface 
in step-by-step process, (b) what is the definition 
of the driving force for massive spalling phenomenon, 
etc. The subjects in the list above are important and 
extremely interesting areas worthy of more studies. 
In this proposed study, we plan to answer these 
questions by two designed experiments: One is the 
high-Pb/Cu soldering reaction in a function of Sn 
concentration and reaction time. Another is the 
replacement of solders. In both experiment, the 
amount of solder used in each reaction was relatively 
large so that the composition of solder can be 
regarded as remaining constant during the reaction.

中文摘要 
隨著封裝與銲點的尺寸日益縮減，在許多微電子銲接反應系統中都可觀察到
銲點的反應界面處隨著銲接反應的時間增長，其上之介金屬化合物產生大規模剝
離(massive spalling)的現象，此現象並因而成為困擾產業界的一項重大可靠度議題。 
大規模剝離現象指的是在銲接反應過程中，界面處的介金屬化合物以連續性且大
規模的方式離開反應界面的現象，此現象已被確認好發於數種銲接反應系統中，
包含錫銀銅 (SnAgCu)銲料與鎳(Ni)基板進行銲接反應[1-3]，錫鋅(SnZn)與銅(Cu)
基板[4]，高鉛銲料(PbSn)與銅(Cu)基板[5,6]，以及高鉛銲料(PbSn)與鎳(Ni)基板[7]
的銲接反應。大規模剝離現象之所以成為學術界與產業界近年來極為關注的議題，
主因是其會造成銲點之強度劣化，最終導致沿界面之脆性破斷發生[3]，脆性破斷
的問題對於銲點的可靠度影響甚鉅。此現象過去雖然被探討良多，然仍無任何研
究團隊得以完備解釋大規模剝離之現象甚或提出配套防治措施。有鑑於此，本計
畫申請人近年來曾以熱力學之觀點對於促成大規模剝離現象的驅動力進行解釋[8]，
並獲得產學界一致認同。而今，本研究團隊特設計系統性實驗，深入驗證大規模
剝離現象之確切發生機制並進一步開發有效防治應對之策略。本研究計畫利用置
換反應銲料以改變銲接系統的方式，進一步闡釋大規模剝離現象與熱力學的直接
關係。此外本計畫也首次以動態現象觀察來呈現大規模剝離現象的剝離動作是如
何逐步完成的。本研究計畫獲得斐然的研究成果，並成功達成計畫中各年度之目

述的兩項特點，此一大規模剝離現象被計畫申請人命名為 massive spalling [8]，並
被眾多學者所沿用。大規模剝離現象會造成銲點之強度隨著高溫儲藏而劣化，最
後導致沿界面脆性斷裂[3](圖四)。這問題對銲點的可靠度影響甚鉅，因此，必須深
入了解其基本機制並進行防治。而本專題計畫將對此一兼具高度學術與應用重要
性之主題進行深入之探討。

文獻探討 
根據文獻紀載[1-7]，大規模剝離現象在以下四個系統中曾被觀察到，包括
SnAgCu 與 Ni 之反應、SnZn 與 Cu 之反應、高鉛 PbSn 與 Cu 之反應、及高鉛 PbSn
與 Ni 之反應。 
(a) SnAgCu 與 Ni 的反應系統中之大規模剝離: 
圖二(a)-(c)為直徑 760 m 之 Sn3Ag0.5Cu 銲錫球與開孔 600 m 之 Au/Ni 基板
經過頂溫 235oC，時間 5 分鐘的迴銲後，界面介金屬化合物產生大規模剝離之反應
結果[8]。界面可觀察到兩種不同之介金屬，離開界面之外層介金屬為(Cu,Ni)6Sn5，
與 Ni 相鄰之介金屬為(Ni,Cu)3Sn4。兩層介金屬的中間區域原本為銲料所填滿，但
在試片製備過程中使用酸蝕液將銲料移除。由圖二可明顯看出，在 SnAgCu 與 Ni
系統中所發生的大規模剝離現象是橫跨整個銲點 [1,2]。 
為了瞭解大規模剝離現象的發生，首先需要先了解 SnAgCu 與 Ni 之間的反應
行為。其中，由於銲料中的 Ag 原子並不直接參與界面反應[9,10]，故在單純討論
界面反應時，吾人可將此界面反應視為是 SnCu 與 Ni 之間的化學反應。當 SnCu
銲料中之 Cu 濃度有些微改變時，本研究團隊發現反應界面的介金屬化合物種類也
會隨之改變，起因即為本研究團隊於先前所提出的著名”Cu 濃度效應”[1]。由於界
面會傾向達到局部相平衡，因此本團隊藉由 Cu-Ni-Sn 相圖[圖五] ，描述可能的擴
散路徑(diffusion path)，並進一步予以"Cu 濃度效應"一個合理的解釋[9-11]︰ 
當銲料中的 Cu 濃度高時(介於 a 與 b 之間)，熔融之銲料會與(Cu,Ni)6Sn5達成
平衡；當銲料中的 Cu 濃度低時(介於 b 與 c 之間)，界面會轉變為與(Ni,Cu)3Sn4的
平衡；當銲料中的 Cu 濃度正好落於 b 點時，則平衡落在 L + (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 + 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 三相區。此結果顯示，隨著 Cu 濃度的增加，界面之反應生成物會由單
一之(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 轉變為(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 與(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 並存，之後變成單一之(Cu,Ni)6Sn5。
然而在上述”Cu 濃度效應”的結果是建立於一個前提之下: 反應的過程中銲料中的
Cu 濃度必需是固定不變、或幾乎不變。若銲料中的 Cu 原子總數有限，當界面處
介金屬化合物的厚度隨著反應時間增加而增厚時，越來越多的 Cu 原子將從銲料內
部回到界面以構成介金屬化合物的一部份，銲料中 Cu 濃度會因此下降。於此情形
中，銲料中的 Cu 濃度會隨時間而變化，此時我們必須將銲料體積效應 (solder 
volume effect)列入考慮。 
 6 
 
 
圖六、式 2 中 Cu 濃度下降與銲點直徑之關係式。 
一般情形下經過一次迴銲，生成之(Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5 的厚度約 1-2 m [2]，而此
時銲料內部之 Cu 濃度下降量可由式(2)計算求得。以銲球直徑 100 m，銲墊開孔
80 m 的銲點為例，只要生成 2 m 之(Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5，就會造成 Cu 濃度的下降
量高達 0.58wt.%。由於工業上運用之 SnAgCu 銲料之 Cu 濃度多半低於 0.7 wt.%，
表示在此情形下，銲料內部的 Cu 大多都已經被消耗。此時界面的相平衡也將由
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 + L 的兩相區轉變為(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 + L 的兩相區，因此將會有一驅動力促
使原本生成於界面之(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 離開，使界面以較穩定之(Ni,Cu)3Sn4存在。 
為證明此論點，本研究團隊曾使用三種不同大小(760, 500, 及 300 m)的
Sn3Ag0.6Cu銲錫球與開孔固定為375 m的Ni墊層進行銲接反應，Ni上沒有鍍金，
在 235oC 下，迴銲 90 秒，反應結果如圖五所示。經過迴銲後，760、500 及 300 m
的銲點界面所生成之(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 厚度分別為 2.3、1.7 及 1.6 m。根據公式(1)可計
算出此時銲點內部的 Cu 濃度分別下降 0.03、0.08 及 0.33wt.%。也就是說，此時銲
點內的 Cu 濃度分別為 0.57、0.52 及 0.27wt.%。因此，在較大的銲錫球(760 m 及
500 m)，界面平衡仍然維持在(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 + L的兩相區，界面並沒有觀察到 spalling
的發生，參閱圖五(a)-(b)。值得注意的是，當銲球的直徑縮小至 300 m 時，界面
平衡會由高 Cu 含量之(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 + L 的兩相區轉變為低 Cu 含量之(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 + L
的兩相區，此時(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 必須離開界面，而界面上可觀察到一層(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 的
生成，如圖五(c)所示。 
 8 
 
此時銲料內殘留之 Cu 濃度為 027 wt.%，且在界面觀察到(Cu,Ni)6Sn5發生 spalling。
[本實驗室研究成果] 
(b) SnZn 與 Cu 的反應系統中之大規模剝離: 
在(a)部份所提出之熱力學觀點也可延伸至 SnZn 銲料與 Cu 反應時，所發生之
大規模剝離現象[4]。SnZn 銲料與 Cu 的反應系統與 SnAgCu/Ni 之反應有非常相似
之處。在 SnAgCu/Ni 的反應中，界面生成之介金屬種類隨著銲料 Cu 濃度的些微改
變而有極大的差異。而 SnZn 銲料與 Cu 的反應所生成之介金屬種類亦會隨著銲料
內 Zn 濃度的不同而有所改變。根據本實驗室之前的研究成果[4]，當 Zn 濃度高於
2 wt.%時，界面生成之介金屬化合物種類為 Cu5Zn8。當 Zn 濃度低於 0.5 wt.%，界
面介金屬化合物則為 Cu6Sn5。此研究指出，Zn 在系統中所佔的比例雖然非常少，
但 Zn 是極具反應性的元素。因此，SnZn 銲料與 Cu 的反應系統亦符合於(a)部份所
提出之兩個大規模剝離現象發生必要條件，而在 Sn0.7Zn 與 Cu 的反應系統中也的
確觀察到 CuZn 介金屬化合物發生大規模剝離現象且在銲料與 Cu 的界面有第二相
介金屬化合物生成，參閱圖八(a)。 
 10 
 
此研究結果可延伸至添加微量 Zn 元素的 SnAg、SnCu 及 SnAgCu 銲料。因為
Zn 是極具反應性的元素，因此只要 Zn 的濃度高於 0.7 wt.%，Cu-Zn 介金屬就會生
成於界面，反之，若 Zn 濃度很低(0.5 wt.%)，則界面生成之介金屬種類為 Cu6Sn5
及 Cu3Sn。本實驗室之研究成果顯示，選擇 Zn 當作微量元素添加於銲料中時，Zn
含量的選擇是需要仔細評估。由本實驗室初步之研究成果顯示，為了避免大規模
剝離現象的發生，Zn 的添加量應該要小於 0.7 wt.%。 
(c) Pb5Sn 與 Cu 的反應系統中之大規模剝離: 
歐盟訂定的 RoHS 在 2006 年開始全面禁用含鉛銲料，而覆晶封裝中的高鉛銲
料不在此規定內。原因為目前研究中的高溫無鉛銲料還沒有辦法取代覆晶封裝中
的高鉛銲料，因此覆晶封裝中的高鉛銲料仍可以使用到 2010 年。也就是說，未來
幾年在覆晶封裝中還是必須使用高鉛銲料。而在高鉛銲料 Pb5Sn 與 Cu 的反應系統
中也觀察到介金屬化合物大規模剝離的現象[5,6]。與之前 SnAgCu/Ni 及 SnZn/Cu
系統不同的是，上述系統大規模剝離都是發生在迴銲的時候，然而在 Pb5Sn 及 Cu
的反應系統中，大規模剝離的發生則發生於固態熱處理時。 
當高鉛銲料 Pb5Sn 與 Cu 反應時，界面只有 Cu3Sn 一種介金屬生成[14, 31]。
在 Jang 等人的研究中[5]，經過迴銲後，Cu3Sn 生成於界面上使銲點與基板有良好
的接著。經過 170 oC 熱處理 200 小時，並沒有觀察到大規模剝離現象的發生，但
是熱處理時間拉長至 500 小時，就可觀察到 Cu3Sn 發生大規模剝離現象的現象。
圖九(a)是經過 170oC 熱處理 1000 小時的反應結果[7]。Jang 等人指出，大規模剝離
現象的發生是由於 Cu3Sn 介金屬的生長，使靠近界面部份的 Sn 被局部消耗；而 Sn
原子在銲料中的擴散很慢，使得遠離界面的 Sn 來不及擴散到界面使 Sn 濃度保持
不變。根據 Pb-Sn-Cu 三元等溫相圖[圖九(b)]，在界面的局部平衡隨著 Sn 濃度的減
少會由Cu6Sn5 + (Pb)兩相區轉變為(Cu3Sn) + Pb的兩相區，最後再轉換到(Cu) + (Pb)
兩相區。因此 spalling 會發生是由於銲料中靠近界面處 Sn 的濃度發生變化所造成
的。事實上，他們更近一步發現，在同樣的實驗條件下，大規模剝離不會發生在
Pb10Sn 與 Cu 的反應系統，因為此時 Sn 的供應是充足的。 
 12 
 
(d) Pb5Sn 與 Ni 的反應系統中之大規模剝離: 
Pb5Sn 除了上述與 Cu 反應會觀察到大規模剝離的發生外，在與 Ni 的反應系
統中也可以觀察到大規模剝離現象的發生[7]。圖十(a)為 Pb5Sn 與 Ni 在 350oC 下反
應90分鐘的結果，可明顯觀察到Ni3Sn4生成於界面上並且發生大規模剝離的現象，
而我們一樣可使用熱力學的觀點來解釋此大規模剝離現象的發生。 
圖十(b)為 Ghosh 利用計算方式所得之 250oC 的 Pb-Sn-Ni 三元等溫相圖[15]。
雖然目前還沒有 350oC 的 Pb-Sn-Ni 三元等溫相圖的資料，但仍可使用 250oC 的相
圖作為 Sn 濃度改變所造成相平衡變化之參考。圖十(b)顯示隨著 Sn 濃度的降低，
與(Pb)達成平衡的相會由 Ni3Sn4 轉換為 Ni3Sn2 之後轉換成 Ni3Sn。因此，當越來越
多的 Sn 原子擴散至界面生成 Ni3Sn4，將造成 Sn 濃度的降低。當 Sn 濃度持續降低，
直到與 Ni3Sn4 不再達成平衡，Ni3Sn4 就會發生大規模剝離的現象。  
 
圖十、 (a)Wang 等人觀察到 Pb5Sn/Ni 在 350 oC 下反應 90 分鐘，界面介金屬
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 發生 massive spalling [7]。(b)Pb-Sn-Ni 之 250

研究方法 
一、驗證大規模剝離現象之發生原因與機構: 
本研究首先以錫銅(SnCu)銲料與鎳(Ni)之銲接系統進行探討。目前廣泛為工業
界所使用之錫銀銅(SnAgCu)銲料與鎳(Ni)基板之銲接系統，因銀(Ag)之添加本義為
改善銲料性質，並不會參與銲料系統中的介面反應。大規模剝離現象乃指特定發
生於系統界面處之現象，故討論此現象時僅需考慮錫銅(SnCu)銲料與鎳(Ni)基板之
銲接系統以期避免多餘不相干元素模糊討論焦點。 
本研究中所有合金銲料皆由 99.9%純元素原料配置而成，再以真空密封置入
1000K 環境下熔煉合金，而後置入回復溫度以上之環境，進行長時間均質化退火。
99.995%純 Ni 基板經過細緻冶金拋光並均勻散佈錫銅(SnCu)助銲劑，置入大量 250
℃新鮮熔融 Sn0.6Cu 銲料中進行液固反應 20 分鐘，接著以水浴焠火冷卻。此處使
用大量銲料參與反應，乃為確保銲料成分不隨反應進行而產生大幅變動。使用研
磨、酸蝕等處理技術除去基板及界金屬化合物上方的所有銲料後，可得單純長有
界金屬化合物之鎳(Ni)基板。將單純長有界金屬化合物之鎳(Ni)基板再度置入大量
250℃新鮮熔融之銲料中進行二次液固反應 1~10min 再以水浴焠火冷卻處理之。本
研究一共系統性地設定了六組子實驗，詳細操作變因，如圖十一所示。 
 
圖十一、實驗步驟示意總流程圖 
 16 
 
箔表面先以 1μm 鑽石進行研磨拋光，再以 5 vol.% HNO3-CH3OH 進行 1 分鐘的腐
蝕處理，再以去離子水清洗乾淨。 
電鍍結束後，製備好的三元擴散偶箔片等分切成 10mm × 10mm 大小一致的
試片。不經過迴銲，直接將試片分別進行 150, 175, 200 及 250℃下不同時間的熱處
理。熱處理完畢，將試片以環氧樹酯鑲埋，進行冶金研磨拋光，使介面組織形貌
曝露出來。介金屬的厚度是以影像分析軟體量測。介金屬的厚度定義為量測到的
介金屬面積除以界面長度。最後以場發射式電子微分析儀 (FE-EPMA, JEOL 
JXA-8500F, Tokyo, Japan)在 15kev 的操作電壓下進行介面微結構形貌觀察、介金屬
組成分析以及介金屬結構分析。 
三、大規模剝離過程之階段性動態現象 
第三階段研究乃藉由高鉛/銅(PbSn/Cu)與高鉛/鎳(PbSn/Ni)之液固反應，進行大
規模剝離現象的研究，實驗中選定四種銲料(PbSn)濃度，依 Sn 濃度的多寡分別為
99.5Pb0.5Sn；99Pb1Sn；97Pb3Sn；95Pb5Sn，並在 1 至 240 分鐘的反應時間下，
分別進行不同反應時間的液固反應。在實驗設計上，採用大量體積的銲料(12 g)與
金屬基板(400 μm)進行反應，因此可獲得 Sn 濃度對於大規模剝離現象的定量分析
結果。 
反應合金原料與基板之製備與前述研究相同，四種 Sn 濃度的銲料 99.5Pb0.5Sn；
99Pb1Sn；97Pb3Sn；95Pb5Sn 在 350oC 的反應條件下反應 1 至 240 分鐘的時間，
經水冷後可得反應偶。所有試片再以機械拋光以及離子拋光進行橫截面觀察。離
子拋光相較於機械拋光，其操作步驟繁複且製備時間較長，然其目的在於可獲得
較本徵之材料橫截形貌。 
而本研究之試片置備包含金相機械研磨拋光、橫截面型離子拋光以及聚焦離
子束拋光(Focused Ion Beam, FIB)，顯微觀察工具為掃瞄式電子顯微鏡(Scanning 
Electron Microscopy, SEM) ，成分分析系統為場發電子探測光顯微分析儀
(Field-Emission Electron Probe X-ray Micro-Analysis, FE-EPMA)，晶體結構鑑定系統為
X-ray 繞射光譜儀(X-ray Diffractometer, XRD)。

圖十三、置換步驟 C1 後的反應界面觀察，反應條件為 250oC 反應時間為(a)1 分鐘、
(b)2 分鐘、(c)3 分鐘以及(d) 10 分鐘。 
 20 
 
 
圖十四、(a)介金屬化合物的大規模剝離現象之二次電子影像圖。(b)以 EBSD 針對
(a)中的 Sn 晶粒進行結晶方向性定位。 
在了解大規模剝離現象的確是介面平衡相相轉變的過程之後，研究團隊於 C2
步驟中，相對於置換低銅濃度的銲料，將純 Sn 銲料置換於原本穩定的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
介金屬化合物上，以期觀察當相轉變的驅動力被提升至極致時所造成的影響。出
乎意料之外的，當置換銲料之反應時間僅僅只達到了 30秒後，原本在界面上穩定
且緻密的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 介金屬化合物即被完全轉變成為(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 介金屬化合物，
如圖十五(a)所示。當反應時間繼續增加，圖十五(b) 及(c)顯示新生成的
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 介金屬化合物僅會繼續增厚；此現象亦證明了(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 是新的系統
穩定平衡相。如此戲劇性的變化，是起因於極大的相轉變驅動力。由於銲料中的
銅原子被完全排除，故原本在界面上穩定的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 介金屬化合物在置換純 Sn
銲料過後，會以極快的速度溶解回銲料，並快速轉換為(Ni,Cu)3Sn4。於此情形中，
系統不再需要大規模剝離現象才得以快速完成平衡相轉變，僅依靠擴散機制即
可。 
 22 
 
 
圖十六、於 C3 置換反應步驟後之界面反應圖。原本於界面穩定的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 經過
置換上高銅濃度的銲料(Sn-0.6Cu)之後，並不產生任何不穩定的現象，僅以繼續
增厚、粗化的方式繼續生長。 
 第二部分：步驟 A2，B2，C4，C5 和 C6 
本研究之第二部分，乃將初始銲接反應實驗提升至 80 分鐘(A2 步驟)。目的主
要是提升原本穩定於界面的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 介金屬化合物之生成量以提供進一步的討
論。如圖十七(a)所示，經過 A2 步驟之後，(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 介金屬化合物會生成高達
6-7 微米，約為反應 20 分鐘所產生厚度的 3 倍。此一厚度將可以提供更細節的，
相轉變時的顯微組織觀察。圖十七(b)則顯示，經過 B2 步驟之後，銲料被完全移除
的界面。

之界面反應形貌。

圖十八、經過 C4 步驟後，界面反應產生變化之形貌。 
研究團隊亦於此實驗中導入對比實驗 C5。相對於置換上低 Cu 濃度的銲料，
研究團隊置換上純 Sn 銲料，以觀察相轉變驅動力被提升至極致所造成的影響。於
此實驗中，厚的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 一旦與純 Sn 銲料進行反應，在僅反應 10 秒鐘後，
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 的厚度即下降將近 25%；同時，一些小顆粒的(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 會析出於近
界面端，如圖十九(a)所示。圖十九(b)則顯示，當反應經過 30 秒鐘後，(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
層會快速溶解，而先前析出的(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 則會繼續成長。當僅僅反應 1 分鐘之後，
原本在界面穩定生成的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 厚層會完全轉變成為(Ni,Cu)3Sn4，如圖十九(c)
所示。直到銲接反應到了 10 分鐘後，圖十九(d)顯示相轉變已經完成，而(Ni,Cu)3Sn4
則會繼續穩定增厚。 
 26 
 
 
圖二十、(a)經過步驟 C4，置換上 Sn-0.3Cu 之界面反應。(b) 經過步驟 C6，置換上
Sn-0.6Cu 之界面反應，無任何剝離現象發生。 
本研究驗證，大規模剝離現象之發生確實為熱力學驅動力所驅使。故大規模
剝離現象事實上即為銲接系統之界面為維持熱力學穩定而進行的一種動力學相轉
變機制。研究亦指出，大規模剝離現象之步驟有三：一、液態 Sn 銲料穿透原本生
長於界面的介金屬化合物層並進一步累積於其內部而形成微小銲料囊。二、眾多
微小銲料囊開始聚集而形成較大之銲料匣，並於其下開始生成第二種介金屬化合
物連續層。三、於銲料匣上方之初始介金屬化合物層開始以大規模且連續性的方
式離開界面並溶解回銲料中，而新生之介金屬化合物層則持續增厚，直至反應完
全。經過 EBSD 的鑑定，大規模剝離上下方的銲料結晶方向並不相同，此結果暗
示上下方的銲料並不屬於同濃度或相關聯之銲料。熱力學相轉變驅動力的大小被
發現與大規模剝離現象的發生息息相關；當驅動力夠大時，則相轉變僅須利用快
速擴散即可達成。另外，本研究中所使用之銲料置換手段本身也被確認與本研究
所觀察到的現象無關。

圖二十二、100μm 的 Ni/95Pb5Sn/Cu 之三元擴散偶在 175 °C 至 250 °C 下進行 500
到 2000 小時熱處理的微結構發展結果。 
為了更進一步研究形貌發展的細節及逐步過程，我們將 Ni 及銲料完全酸蝕，
以觀察 Cu 基材端的形貌。於 250°C 下 500 小時熱處理的結果，Ni/(100 微米 
95Pb5Sn)/Cu 試片中，大規模剝離處是隨機分布在 Cu 的表面上，大規模剝離處的
俯視圖如圖二十三(a)所示。若將此處進行放大，中間灰暗的區域為暴露出來的 Cu
基板，其餘為 Cu3Sn 如圖二十三(b)所示。移除銲料後的大規模剝離處斷面圖則於
圖二十三(c)中呈現。根據這些觀察，我們提出針對固態反應中大規模剝離的一系
列逐步的發展過程，繪製於圖二十四中。 
 30 
 
在反應的過程中，Cu3Sn 首先形成在 Cu 的表面上，如圖二十四(a)所示。在
Cu3Sn 的內部出現微孔洞。這些微孔洞的形成與文獻一致[34-37]。當越多的 Cu3Sn
形成，銲料中的 Sn 原子逐漸會被消耗，因此銲料中的 Sn 濃度會逐漸下降。接著，
這些微孔洞會開始聚合，如圖二十四(b)所示，導致 Cu3Sn 層局部弱化。當微孔洞
聚合到一定的數量，匯道可能大量形成，以使銲料內流至 Cu3Sn/Cu 之間，如圖二
十四(c)所示。這些匯道亦會使 Cu 溶解而向外擴散，如圖二十四(d)所示。 
 
圖二十四、Ni/(100 微米 95Pb5Sn)/Cu 擴散偶之 spalling 行為逐步的發展過程 
本實驗亦使用 400μm 厚的試片與上列實驗進行擴散距離對於界面反應之影響
的比較。結果顯示，這兩種厚度的試片所導致的差異為：一、即便於高溫、長時
間之熱處理後，大規模剝離現象在 400μm 厚的 95Pb5Sn 的試片中依舊不會被驅動
發生，如圖二十三所示。二、在 Ni 端僅會觀察到(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 相存在，而不會有
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 的存在。此結果說明了，當兩側擴散距離被增加時，基板的原子(Ni 與
Cu)並無足夠的能力快速跨越該距離，並對另一側界面反應產生影響。亦即即便另
一側為 Cu 基板，於 Ni 基板側所感應到的銲料內部銅濃度仍為低落，故 Ni 基板與
低銅濃度之銲料僅會生成(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 介金屬化合物。

100μm 擴散偶的 wSn 的數值計算與作圖在圖二十四中。根據圖二十四顯示，經
過熱處理後，殘留 Sn 的濃度隨著熱處理時間增加而減少。 
 
圖二十四、Ni/(100 微米 95Pb5Sn)/Cu 擴散偶的殘留 Sn 濃度的計算數值作圖 
若觀察 Pb-Sn-Cu 三元平衡相圖，如圖二十五所示[40]，隨著 Sn 濃度的減少，
介面的局部平衡會從 Cu3Sn+(Pb)兩相區轉換至(Cu)+(Pb)兩相區。因此，當 Sn 濃度
減少至臨界濃度值，富 Cu 相會傾向直接與富 Pb 相接觸。而 Cu3Sn 從介面處發生
spalling 是達成局部平衡的一種方式。換句話說，大規模剝離的驅動力純粹是熱力
學的本質特性。因此 100μm 擴散偶的 Cu3Sn 會發生大規模剝離，是因為 Sn 濃度
的快速減少所造成的。而 400μm 的擴散偶，因為銲料有較多的 Sn 原子，所以 Sn
濃度減少的速率較 100μm 的擴散偶慢。因此，對 400μm 的擴散偶而言，銲料中的
Sn 濃度永遠不會達到臨界 Sn 濃度值。因此 400μm 的擴散偶不會觀察到 Cu3Sn 的
spalling

三、大規模剝離現象於 95Pb5Sn 與 Ni 之銲接反應 
 95Pb5Sn 與 Ni 基板之反應 
如圖二十六(a)所示，一層薄的介金屬化合物於反應界面處形成，然而由於它
的厚度太薄，仍無法準確地以 FE-EPMA 進行成分分析。在較長的反應時間後，此
介金屬化合物被分析定為Ni3Sn4。當反應時間達到 20分鐘時，如圖二十六(b)所示，
反應界面上仍然只有生成一種介金屬化合物，經由 FE-EPMA 分析，這種化合物仍
為 Ni3Sn4。於此同時，少量空孔洞出現於 Ni3Sn4 以及 Ni 基板之間。圖二十六(c)
顯示，當反應時間達到 240 分鐘後，FE-EPMA 分析結果確定了 Ni3Sn4 與 Ni3Sn2
的存在。Ni3Sn4 與 Ni3Sn2 之間的對比是非常微弱的，研究團隊於圖二十六(c)與(d)
中加入細虛線以協助辨識。圖二十六(c)與(d)顯示， Ni3Sn2 和 Ni 當中同時存在有
空孔洞與高鉛相（Pb）。由於本研究中的銲接反應皆依離子研磨拋光技術進行製備，
故所獲得之橫截面皆可視為真實本質結構，以排除孔洞和 Pb 相可能因為機械拋光
過程中引起的偽影。後面將要討論的空孔洞和高鉛相（Pb）形成的合理解釋。 
 36 
 
 97Pb3Sn 與 Ni 基板之反應 
當 Sn 於銲料中濃度成為 3wt.%時，反應 2 分鐘後的界面會形成一層薄的介金
屬化合物，如圖二十七(a)所示。依據先前研究經驗指出，於此銲料濃度下所生成
之介金屬化合物被認定為 Ni3Sn2。圖二十七(b)顯示，當時間達到 20 分鐘，較厚的
Ni3Sn2 會於界面上形成。並且於 Ni3Sn2 與 Ni 之間會開始形成一些清晰可見的空孔
洞。當反應時間達到 240 分鐘後，一種新的介金屬化合物 Ni3Sn 會於 Ni3Sn2 底部
開始的界面處形成，如圖二十七(c)顯示。同樣的，Ni3Sn2 和 Ni3Sn 之間的對比度是
非常微弱的，故研究團隊於圖二十七(c)中加入虛線以增加對比以協助描繪這兩種
介金屬化合物。 
 
圖二十七、97Pb3Sn 與 Ni 之銲接反應，於 400oC 下反應(a)2、(b)20 與(c)240 分鐘。 
  
 38 
 
在銲接反應的過程中，銲料中的 Sn 原子傾向與 Ni 進行反應，以形成 Ni-Sn
介金屬化合物於反應界面處。如果銲料的量小，例如在覆晶封裝中，隨著 Ni-Sn
介金屬化合物的成長，銲料中 Sn 濃度會趨於大幅降低。然而，於我們的研究中，
銲料量被特意設置地非常大(12 克)，如此的設計使得 Ni-Sn 介金屬化合物的形成過
程中並不會造成銲料濃度有所影響。因此，銲料中的 Sn 濃度保持幾乎恆定。這樣
做的目的是使得 Sn 濃度效應可以在這項研究中先行被確立。值得注意的是，在本
研究中所獲得的結果，應該被視為用來解釋考慮體積效應下的真實覆晶封裝之情
形。 
根據的Ni-Sn二元相圖所示(參照圖二十九)[40]，有三種穩定的介金屬化合物，
Ni3Sn Ni3Sn2 及 Ni3Sn4金屬，可能在溫度低於 400
o
C 時於 Ni-Sn 反應界面處形成。
對於 PbSn/ Ni 三元反應系統中，圖三十則為在 400℃的 Pb-Sn-Ni 三元相圖[41]。在
這項研究中，當 Sn 濃度為 5 wt.％時，第一種形成的介金屬化合物為 Ni3Sn4，接著
是 Ni3Sn4 旁邊的 Ni3Sn2 形成，在 240 分鐘（參見圖二十六）。當 Sn 的濃度為 3 wt.
％，則會先形成 Ni3Sn2，然後在 240 分鐘（參照圖二十七），Ni3Sn2旁邊 Ni3Sn 介
金屬化合物開始形成。當 Sn 的濃度為 1 wt.％，則會形成 Ni3Sn2，Ni3Sn2 於此反應
中是唯一會形成的相（參照圖二十八）。本研究中所有銲料系統中優先形成的介金
屬化合物皆與 Pb-Sn-Ni 三元相圖等溫線（參照圖三十）的預測是一致的。 Ni3Sn4
介金屬化合物會優先生成在 95Pb5Sn/Ni 的反應中，其反應可以圖三十中
Ni3Sn4+(Pb)兩相區中的截線(tie-line)所代表。當銲料中 Sn 的濃度為 3 wt.％或 1 wt.
％時，反應則可以圖三十中 Ni3Sn2+(Pb)兩相區中的截線(tie-line)所代表。因此，
Ni3Sn2 會優先形成。本研究中，在 95Pb5Sn 的銲料中優先生成的介金屬化合物種
類，也與文獻所記載的工作相一致[42]。 
 
 40 
 
如圖二十六(c)所示，在長時間反應下，孔洞與(Pb)相會形成於 Ni3Sn2和 Ni 之
間。這樣的顯微組織與許多文獻[1, 2, 5, 7-11]報與前兩階段研究非常相似。根據本
研究團隊先前對於大規模剝離所提出之理論，大規模剝離現象乃為系統平衡相轉
變的一個過程。主因為原本在界面處的反應產物不再與銲料產生局部熱力學平衡，
故該化合物會傾向剝離自反應界面，並使得新的平衡相得以成核、生長於界面上。
然而，正如剛才指出，由於在這項研究中，Sn 的濃度在反應過程中並不會改變，
故所形成的微孔洞與(Pb)的區域，勢必為另一個機制所主導。 
最有可能的解釋是本研究中所觀察到的孔洞與(Pb)區域乃為界面能所主導之
結果。事實上，純熔融鉛可穿透 Ni 的晶粒邊界已被報導過在高溫反應中會發生（> 
600℃）[43,44]。文獻大多將此現象歸因於熔融 Pb 滲透至 Ni 晶界可降低系統總界
面能(因為熔融 Pb 與 Ni 的界面能較低)。為了確認孔洞與(Pb)區域的形成的確與晶
界滲透有關，本研究透過實驗，以相同於本研究其他實驗的反應步驟，將 Ni 基板
在 400℃下與純 Pb 銲料反應 240 分鐘。圖三十一明確地指出純 Pb 和 Ni 基片之間
的反應的確會造成Ni晶界被溶融Pb穿透的效果(圖中Ni基板內部的白色對比相)。
換句話說，溶融 Pb 已沿晶粒邊界滲透到 Ni 基板中。若非藉由離子研磨拋光技術，
幾乎無法觀察此顯微現象。這是學界首次在 400℃的溫度下，觀察到溶融 Pb 滲透
至 Ni 晶界中。圖三十一亦指出，暴露於熔融 Pb 下的 Ni 表面相當粗糙。換句話說，
熔融的 Pb 會破壞最初光滑的 Ni 表面。此微觀結構亦在 400℃下、240 分鐘，在
95Pb5Sn/Ni 的反應中被觀察到如圖二十六(d)。因此，於介金屬化合物和 Ni 之間的
孔洞應該是先被(Pb）相所佔滿。根據此一觀察，在 95Pb5Sn/Ni 銲接反應中(圖二
十六(a))，相對應的銲料/Ni3Sn4/(Ni)擴散路徑繪製於圖三十二(a)中。另外，圖二十
六(b)中的相對應擴散路徑銲料/Ni3Sn4/Ni3Sn2/(Pb)/(Ni) 繪製於圖三十二(b)中。 於
此研究中的大規模剝離現象，可依擴散路徑的分析以進行解釋。由於 Ni 中的 Sn
擴散是一個非常緩慢的過程中，優先形成 (Pb)相可成為系統達到局部熱力學平衡
的更快路徑。當銲料接觸到了 Ni 基板時， Ni-Sn 介金屬化合物層將會生成於反應
界面處。隨著反應時間的增加，(Pb)相會於 Ni-Sn 介金屬化合物與 Ni 基板之間生
成。並隨著反應時間的進一步增加，(Pb)相會形成一層連續層，接著開始發生大規
模剝離現象。

95Pb-5Sn solder in the solder bump relative to the
37Pb-63Sn content in the screen-printed solder
paste was 16:5. With this mass ratio, these two
solders, when completely mixed, will from an alloy
with an overall composition of 81Pb-19Sn. Detailed
description of the flip-chip solder joints and the
assembly process has been provided in a previous
publication,27 and is omitted here.
After assembly, the samples were subjected to
high-temperature storage at 100C, 130C, 150C or
175C for different periods of time. After aging, the
solder joints were mounted in epoxy and metallo-
graphically polished to reveal the interface and the
internal microstructure. Image analysis software
was used to measure the thickness of the layer of
intermetallic compounds. The thickness of each
layer was defined as the total area occupied by the
intermetallic compound divided by the linear length
of the interface. A state-of-the-art field-emission
electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JXA-
8500F; JEOL Tokyo, Japan) operated at 15 keV was
used to identify the composition of the reaction
products. During the microprobe measurement, Ka,
Ka, and La x-rays were detected for Cu, Ni, and Sn,
respectively. In the microprobe analysis, the con-
centrations of each of these elements were mea-
sured independently, and the total weight
percentage was within 100 ± 1 wt.% in each case.
For every data point, at least four measurements
were made, and the average value is reported.
RESULTS
In this study, the cross-sectional microstructures
from the center bump of the first outer row of
each package were examined. As reported in our
previous study,27 after assembly, intermixing of
95Pb-5Sn and 37Pb-63Sn was relatively limited.
There was only a very thin layer of NiSn inter-
metallic compound near the chip side. The thick-
ness of this layer was too thin to be positively
identified by FE-EPMA, but this layer was likely
Ni3Sn4.
27 On the substrate side, an outer layer of
Cu6Sn5 and an inner layer of Cu3Sn existed in the
as-assembled condition.27
Figure 2 shows the microstructure evolution for
solder joints aged at 130C to 175C for 100 h to
2000 h. The initial small Sn-rich grains (the dark
regions) coarsened into larger grains with aging, as
shown in Fig. 2a–d. However, coarsening was not
the only process at work. There was a second and
parallel process that controlled the microstructure
of the solder, i.e., consumption of Sn atoms due to
the intermetallic formations at both interfaces. As
shown in Fig. 2e–h and i–l, the amount of the
Sn-rich phase decreased with aging. Accompanying
this decrease of the Sn-rich phase, the intermetallic
layer thickness at both interfaces increased with
aging. At 175C, the Sn-rich phase had almost been
completely exhausted after 3000 h of aging, as
shown in Fig. 3.
The growth of intermetallic compounds at 175C
during aging at both interfaces is shown in Fig. 4.
Regarding the types of compound formed at the
interface, the results shown in Fig. 4 are typical. The
formation and microstructure at other temperatures
were similar, only at slower rates. On the chip side,
there was initially only (Ni,Cu)3Sn4, as shown in
Fig. 4a. Nevertheless, when the aging time reached
2000 h, the Ni UBM layer had been completely
consumed, and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 started to formed
between (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and solder, as shown in Fig. 4c.
The exact composition of the intermetallics, as
determined by using FE-EPMA, is marked in Fig. 4.
It should be emphasized that our results repeatedly
showed that (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 would not form between
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and solder until the Ni UBM had been
completely consumed. This result suggested that,
when the Ni atoms from the Ni UBM were no longer
available, the original (Ni0.82,Cu0.18)3Sn4 layer
would be gradually converted into (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5
due to the continuous incoming Cu flux from the
other side of the solder joint.
On the substrate side, there were two interme-
tallic compounds, Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn, formed on Cu,
as shown in Fig. 4b and d. FE-EPMA analysis did
not detect any Ni signal within the Cu6Sn5 and
Cu3Sn layers. The thickness ratio of Cu6Sn5 to
Cu3Sn also changed with aging time, from about 1:1
at 1000 h to 1:3 at 2000 h. In the reaction of Cu with
Sn-rich solder, this ratio tends to stay at 1:1 after an
extended period of aging at high temperature. This
was due to the fact that, in this study, the supply of
Sn was limited. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the
Sn-rich phase was consumed relatively fast at
175C. The Sn content in solder decreased with
aging. When the Sn content of the solder decreased,
the net reaction at the interface became the con-
sumption of the Cu6Sn5 layer to form the Cu3Sn
Fig. 1. Schematic showing the high-lead solder bump placed onto a
eutectic Sn-Pb presolder after assembly. The Ni UBM thickness was
about 3 lm.
Chang, Wang, Lai, and Kao1290
consumption rate in the 95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn
presolder combination was slower than with pure
eutectic Sn-Pb solder. This was probably due to
the fact that there was less Sn available in the
95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn presolder combination.
The formation of microvoids between Cu3Sn and
Cu was also observed in this study, as shown in
Fig. 9. The formation of such microvoids had been
reported in the reaction between lead-free solders
and Cu as well as between 37Pb-63Sn and Cu7–9 but
never in systems involving high-lead solders. The
mechanism for the formation of the microvoids was
probably the same as that in lead-free solders as
well as in 37Pb-63Sn; it was probably due to faster
diffusion of Cu in Cu3Sn compared with that of Sn.
It should be emphasized that these microvoids only
appeared after an extended period of aging, such as
Fig. 4. Microstructures of interfaces after aging at 175C for 1000 h and 2000 h.
Fig. 5. Average thickness of the interfacial Cu6Sn5 layer for different
temperatures plotted against the high-temperature storage time.

temperatures plotted against the high-temperature storage time.

tures plotted against the high-temperature storage time.
Chang, Wang, Lai, and Kao1292
solder can be consumed by formation of interme-
tallic compounds. Compared with pure 37Pb-63Sn
bumps, the Ni consumption rate of the UBM was
higher when the 95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn pre-
solder combination was used. On the other hand,
the Cu consumption rate on the substrate side for
the 95Pb-5Sn bump/37Pb-63Sn presolder combina-
tion was slower than for pure 37Pb-63Sn. The for-
mation of microvoids was observed, for the first time
for high-lead solder, but these voids formed only
after extended periods of solid-state aging at high
temperature, such as after 100 h at 175C, after
500 h at 130C, or after 1500 h at 100C.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The Ni/95Pb-5Sn/Cu diffusion couples were pre-
pared by electroplating a 95Pb-5Sn layer (100 lm or
400 lm) and then a Ni layer (20 lm) over Cu foil
substrates. A schematic drawing of the sample
structure is shown in Fig. 1. The Cu foil was 400 lm
thick and 99.6 wt.% pure. Before electroplating,
each Cu foil surface was polished, with 1 lm dia-
mond abrasive used in the last polishing step. The
Cu foil was then lightly etched in 5 vol.% HNO3-
CH3OH solution for 1 min and cleaned with deion-
ized water.
After electroplating, the foils were cut into
10 mm 9 10 mm diffusion couples. The samples

previous studies, microvoids were also reported to
form at the reaction of the lead-free, 37Pb-63Sn, and
composites solder.10,20–22 When aging was carried
out at 250C, as shown in Fig. 3c, on the Ni side
there were two intermetallic compounds: a Ni–Sn
compound and (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5 formed at the
original 95Pb-5Sn/Ni interface. It is interesting
to note that the Cu atoms from the Cu side were
able to diffuse across the 95Pb-5Sn layer to form
(Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5 on the Ni side. On the Cu side, a
lot of the intermetallics compounds (Cu3Sn) had
spalled from the interface, as shown in Fig. 3d. More
discussion about this spalling will be presented
later. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the
spalling phenomenon could occur even though the
diffusion couples experienced no reflow.
Subsequent aging did not change the types of the
reaction products or their morphologies on the Ni
side. As shown in Fig. 4a, after aging at 175C for
2000 h, a layer of Ni3Sn4 formed. For the case of
250C, as shown in Fig. 4b, (Cu0.4Ni0.6)6Sn5 and
Ni3Sn4 formed. The growth kinetics for Ni3Sn4 and
(Cu0.4Ni0.6)6Sn5 at other time and temperatures are
shown in Fig. 5.
Subsequent aging did not change the types of the
reaction products on the Cu side, but the Cu3Sn
morphology underwent very interesting develop-
ment. Figure 6 shows the microstructure evolution
for the 100 lm diffusion couple during aging at
175C to 250C for 500 h to 2000 h. Figure 6a1–d1
shows the gradual development of the massive
spalling of the Cu3Sn layer. The spalling started
from the congregation of microvoids in Cu3Sn, as
shown in Fig. 6a1–b1. The Pb-rich phase migrated

As pointed out previously, the Sn concentration in
the solder did not stay constant during aging. The
Sn atoms could be incorporated into Cu3Sn, Ni3Sn4
or Cu6Sn5. Accordingly, the Sn concentration devi-
ated from its initial value. The Sn concentration can
be estimated from the mass balance consideration
for Sn. We define the residual Sn concentration wSn
(in wt.%) as the total amount of Sn atoms in the
solder divided by the solder volume. With this defi-
nition, one obtains the following equation:
dsolder  qsolder  wSn
¼ dsolder  qsolder  w0Sn 
X
IMC
dIMC  qIMC  wSn=IMC;
(1)
where wSn
0 and wSn/IMC represent the initial Sn con-
centration in the solder and the Sn concentration
in Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5 or Ni3Sn4 (all in wt.%), respec-
tively; dsolder and dIMC represent the thickness of
the solder and the thickness of Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5 or
Ni3Sn4, respectively (Fig. 1); qsolder and qIMC repre-
sent the density of high-lead solder, and interme-
tallic compounds, respectively. The densities of
Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5, Ni3Sn4, and Pb-5Sn can be taken as
9 g/cm3, 8.28 g/cm3, 8.64 g/cm3, and 10.8 g/cm3,
respectively.26 The values of wSn/Cu3Sn, wSn/Cu6Sn5,
and wSn/Ni3Sn4 are 38.3 wt.%, 60.9 wt.%, and
72.9 wt.% according to the Cu3Sn, Cu6Sn5, and
Ni3Sn4 formulae, respectively. With these material
properties applied to Eq. 1, one obtains the residual
Sn concentration in solder as

The interfacial reaction between SnAgCu and Ni is inﬂuenced by three important factors, namely, the Cu
concentration in solder, solder volume, and temperature. In our previous studies, the ﬁrst two factors
had been investigated individually. In this study, the effects of these three factors are studied concur-
rently. Three different sizes of solder spheres (300, 500, and 760m in diameter) with three different Cu
concentrations (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7wt.%) are used. The aging temperatures are 160 and 180 ◦C. It is found
that as the residual apparent Cu concentration in the solder decreases and the solder volume reduces,
the type of intermetallic compound changes from (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 to (Ni,Cu)3Sn4. This study conﬁrms that
the critical Cu concentration decreases as the temperature decreases. In addition, the massive spalling
phenomenon, which tends to occur in a liquid–solid reaction, is not observed in the solid-solid reaction.

1. Introduction
In our previous studies, a strong Cu-concentration effect
between SnAgCu and Ni was reported [1–4]. With a slight increase
inCuconcentration, the reactionproduct changed from(Ni,Cu)3Sn4
to (Cu,Ni)6Sn5. At 235 ◦C, the critical Cu concentration for such
a change was 0.4wt.% [1–4]. In addition to our reports, several
papers had also been published on this subject [5–7]. To under-
stand the interfacial reactions and the reaction mechanisms, the
equilibrium phase relationship is a powerful tool. The important
ternary Sn–Cu–Ni system has been investigated by various groups
[8–11]. Recently, Yu et al. [12], using thermodynamic calculation
(the CALPHAD approach), predicted that the critical Cu concentra-
tion was in fact a strong function of temperature. It decreases with
decreasing temperature [12]. In other words, temperature is also
an important factor in the reaction between SnAgCu and Ni.
In addition to the Cu concentration and temperature, solder vol-
ume is also known to be an important factor in many soldering
reactions [13–17], and several studies have reported the effect of
solder volumeon the reactionbetweenSnAgCuandNi [18–21]. This
solder-volumeeffect on the reactionbetweenSnAgCuandNi canbe
attributed to the limited supply of Cu atoms.With the growthof Cu-
bearing intermetallics, the available Cu in the solder decreases and
the Cu concentration decreases accordingly. Excessive decrease in
Cu concentration might change the equilibrium of the intermetal-
lic at the interface. In short, the solder-volume effect is a particular
type of expression of the Cu-concentration effect.

The objective of this study is two-fold. The ﬁrst is to experi-
mentally verify the temperature effect predicted by Yu et al. [12].
The second is to gain an understanding of the combined effect of
Cu concentration, solder volume, and temperature on the reaction
between SnAgCu and Ni.
2. Experimental procedure
Fig. 1 shows the schematic drawing of the solder joints used in this study. Solder
ballswith three different Cu concentrations (Sn3AgxCu, x=0.3, 0.5, and 0.7wt.%) and
three different diameters (300, 500, and 760m) were used. The contact pads had
only a Ni layer over Cu (i.e. without a gold layer over Ni). The pad opening diameter
was 375m. The Ni layer was electrolytically plated and free of phosphorous.
Before reﬂow, all substrateswere dipped into a dilute hydrochloric acid solution
and then ﬂuxed. Then, the solder balls were placed on the pads manually. There-
after, sampleswere reﬂowedwitha typical proﬁle (235 ◦Cpeak temperatureand90 s
molten solder duration). It was possible that solder balls of different sizes experi-
enced slightly different thermal histories. But we believe that this effect is relatively
weak. The smaller balls tended to melt earlier than larger balls, but they also solid-
iﬁed earlier than the larger ones. After reﬂow, the samples were subjected to aging
at 160 or 180 ◦C for 1000h.
The compositions of the reaction products were determined using a ﬁeld-
emission electronmicroanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-850F). Inmicroprobe analysis,
the concentration of each element was measured independently, and the total
weight percentage of all the elements was within 100 (±2)wt.% in each case. The
mean thickness of the interfacial intermetallic layers for various times was mea-
sured with the aid of image-processing software. The thickness was deﬁned as the
total area occupied by the intermetallic divided by the linear length of the interface.
3. Results
According to the results obtained in this study, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 are the only two compounds that are formed at the
interface. In the following, the results are presented according to
the initial Cu concentration in the solders. For the microstructures

The results of this study conﬁrm that the critical Cu concentration
is between 0.39 and 0.3 at 240 ◦C (see third and fourth columns of
Table 1). The results of this study at lower temperatures (160 and
180 ◦C) are also consistent with the extrapolation of the dashed
curve in Fig. 5.
5. Conclusion
The prediction by Yu et al. [12]—that the critical Cu concentra-
tion is temperature dependent—has been experimentally veriﬁed
in this study. The prediction that the critical Cu concentration
decreases with decreasing temperature is correct not only in its
qualitative trend but also in its quantitative accuracy.
This study also points out that the interfacial reaction between
SnAgCu andNi is inﬂuencedby three important factors, namely, the
Cu concentration in solder, temperature, and the solder volume.
The ﬁrst factor expresses itself through the critical Cu concen-
tration. The second factor is important in that the critical Cu
concentration decreases with temperature. The third factor is
important because it limits the availability of Cu atoms in the sol-
der. As the solder volume reduces, it becomesmore difﬁcult for the
Cu concentration to remain constant.

were also reported to form at interface in the lead-free, 37Pb63Sn 
and composites solder system [10, 20-22]. When aging was carried 
out at 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 3c, on the Ni side there were two 
intermetallic compounds, a Ni-Sn compound and (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5 
formed at the original 95Pb5Sn/Ni interface. It is interesting to note 
that the Cu atoms from the Cu side were able to diffuse across the 
95Pb5Sn layer to form (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5 on the Ni side. On the Cu 
side, a lot of the intermetallics compounds (Cu3Sn) had spalled from 
the interface, as shown in Fig. 3d. More discussion about this 
spalling will be presented later. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note 
that the spalling phenomenon could occur even though the diffusion 
couples experienced no reflow.

and (c)-(d) 250 °C.  
Subsequent aging did not change the types of the reaction 
products and their morphologies on the Ni side. As shown in Fig. 4 a, 
after aging at 175 °C for 2000 h, a layer of the Ni3Sn4 formed. For 
the case of 250 oC, as shown in Fig. 4b, (Cu0.4Ni0.6)6Sn5 and Ni3Sn4 
formed. The growth kinetics for Ni3Sn4 and (Cu0.4Ni0.6)6Sn5 at other 
time and temperatures are shown in Fig. 5.

the Ni/(100 m 95bP5Sn)/Cu diffusion couple after 2000 h of aging

Subsequent aging did not change the types of the reaction 
products on the Cu side, but the Cu3Sn morphology underwent very 
interesting development. Figure 6 shows the microstructure evolution 
for 100 m the diffusion couple during aging at 175 °C to 250 °C for 
500-2000 h. Figure 6a1-d1 shows the gradual development of the 
massive spalling of the Cu3Sn layer. The spalling started from the 
congregation of micro-voids in Cu3Sn, as shown in Fig. 6a1-b1. The 
Pb-rich phase migrated into the region originally occupied by the 
congregated micro-voids when the time reached 1500 h, as shown in 
Fig. 6c1. The spalling completed when the time reached 2000 h, as 
shown in Fig. 6d1. At higher temperatures such as 200 and 250 °C, 
the kinetics of the morphological evolution was much faster. The 
spalling completed before 500 h, as shown in Fig. 6a2 and a3. It 
should also be noted that in each diffusion couple, the number of 
regions exhibiting such spalling increased with aging time. The 
initiation time for this spalling was about 1500 h at 175 °C, 50 h at 
200 °C, and 5 h at 250 °C.

The results presented in previous paragraphs are for the 
cases where the 95Pb5Sn were 100 m thick. Experiments 
using 400 m 95Pb5Sn were also carried out in this study. 
There were two major differences between these two sets of 
experiments. The first is that no spalling was ever observed 
when 400 m 95Pb5Sn was used, as shown in Fig. 7. The 
second was that on the Ni side, only Ni3Sn4 was ever observed, 
and Cu6Sn5 never appeared on the Ni side in all diffusion 
couples with 400 m 95Pb5Sn. 
DISCUSSION 
The most interesting feature observed in this study is the spalling 
of Cu3Sn shown in Fig. 3 and 6. In order to understand if this 
massive spalling was caused by the specific configuration of the 
ternary diffusion couple or this spalling can also occurred in binary 
diffusion couples, 95Pb5Sn(100 m)/Cu binary diffusion couple was 
aged at 250 oC for 100 h. As shows in Fig. 8, spalling could also 
occur in binary diffusion couple. In other words, the spalling 
phenomenon was not induced by Ni in Ni/95Pb5Sn/Cu ternary 
diffusion couple.  
 In literature, this spalling had been reported in several systems, 
including SnAgCu soldered on Ni [19-21], SnZn on Cu [22], 
high-lead on Cu [9-10], and high-lead on Ni [8]. Nevertheless, the 
step-by-step sequence of events had never been described in detail. 
In order to investigate the detailed morphological evolution and 
sequence of events, the Ni layer and the solder layer were etched 
away by acid. The resulting top-view micrograph, showing the 
spalling sites for a Ni/(100 m 95Pb5Sn)/Cu diffusion couple aged at 
250 °C for 500 h, is shown in Fig. 9a. The zoom-in micrograph of a 
single spalling site is shown in Fig. 9b. The cross-sectional view for 
  
slower rate compared to the 100 m diffusion couples because there 
were more Sn atoms in a thicker solder layer. Consequently, for 400 
m diffusion couples, the Sn concentration in solder never reached 
the critical Sn concentration necessary for spalling. Therefore, Cu3Sn 
spalling was not observed for 400 m diffusion couples.

SUMMARY 
During solid-state aging, only a layer of the Cu3Sn formed on the 
Cu side, and the both Ni3Sn4 and Cu6Sn5 formed on the Ni side of the 
Ni/95Pb5Sn/Cu ternary diffusion couples. The amounts intermetallic 
compounds increased with time at these two interfaces, which 
consumed the Sn atoms within the solder. When the aging 
temperature was high, e.g., 250 oC, a large portion of Sn within the 
solder was consumed by the formation of intermetallic compounds 
very quickly. Due to the decrease of the Sn concentration, Cu3Sn was 
no longer in local thermodynamic equilibrium with Cu, and the 
Cu3Sn was driving away to let the high-lead solder to be in direct 
contact with Cu. This spalling phenomenon depended on the aging 
temperature. A detailed sequence of event for the spalling was 
successfully constructed.

A layer of mildly activated rosin ﬂux was printed onto the as-plated Ni–Au sub-
strates using a metal stencil. The Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder balls (diameter: 0.75 mm) were
then placed on the substrates. The assemblies were reﬂowed for either one or three
cycles in an oven with ten heating zones, at ambient oxygen levels of 20 ppm. The
reﬂow conditions were 245 C for 35 s beyond the liquidus temperature (217 C),
and the cooling rate was set at 2.0 C s1. The IMC layer thickness was measured
by performing ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-
4800, operating voltage: 15 kV) observations on the cross-sectioned solder joints,
and the correlation between the P concentration (ppm) and the IMC layer thickness
was determined.
The interfaces of the solder joints were analyzed by bright-ﬁeld transmission
electron microscopy (BF-TEM, JEOL JEM-1011; operating voltage: 100 kV). The
interfacial compositions of the solder joint were analyzed using energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) with a beam size of about 10 nm. For TEM observations,
a layer of silica was coated on the specimens by direct-write chemical vapor depo-
sition (CVD), so that the oxide layer was well protected. Oxygen and siloxane
(tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Si4O4C4H16) were used as chemical precursors and
guided to a small-area region on the sample surface for TEM analysis. A focused
ion beam (FIB) of Ga+ ions with energy of 50 kV was introduced to provide the nec-
essary energy for CVD. The thickness of the small area over which silicon oxide
deposited was inspected in situ by FIB imaging. The area of interest was then
ion-milled down to a thickness of less than 100 nm, after which ‘‘lift-out’’ was
carried out.
The mechanical properties of the P-doped and undoped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joints
were evaluated by means of a pull test performed using a Dage-4000 instrument.
The weight of the cartridge head was 5 kg, and the pulling speed of the head was
set at 4 mm s1. The grip jaw was set at a height of 50 lm above the substrate so
that the interface of the solder joint could also be evaluated in the test. The maxi-
mum tensile strain and strength were then determined, and the P content of the
solder joint was plotted against the IMC thickness and the pull strain. In addition,
the pull strengths of the solder joint for one and three reﬂow cycles were compared.
3. Results
Fig. 1 shows a series of backscattering electron SEM micro-
graphs, which indicated that the total IMC thickness decreased as
the P content of the P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder was increased.
The IMC morphology changed from chunky to planar. The micro-
graph in Fig. 1c shows the 100-ppm-P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder
after reaction with the Ni–Au substrate. A thin and ﬂat IMC layer
existed at the interface between the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder and the sub-
strate. In the case of the solder with higher P doping (500 ppm), the
IMC layer was too thin, and hence, measurements had to be carried
out at higher magniﬁcation, as shown in Fig. 1d.
Fig. 2a shows a plot of the IMC thickness against the P concen-
tration. g is denoted as P concentration at ppm level. The graph
shows that the thickness of the IMC layer is inversely proportional
to the P concentration. Fig. 2b shows the curve ﬁtting of the IMC
thickness against the P concentration (ppm). Since the thin and ﬂat
IMC layer was ﬁrst observed for the 100-ppm-P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu
solder, the interface of this solder joint was analyzed by TEM
observations. Fig. 3 shows the BF-TEM image of the IMC with
100 ppm P. EDX analysis was performed on this region, and three
spots were identiﬁed. Spot (a), which was in the upper region of
the nanocrystallite, was attributed to (Ni,Cu)6Sn5. This IMC
comprised multiple nodular grains stacked on one another. Spot
(c), in the lower region, was due to (Ni,Cu)3Sn4. Between the
(Ni,Cu)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 layers, there was a nanocrystallite
layer. EDX analysis of spot (b) indicated that these crystallites com-
prised Sn, Cu, Ni, and P. EDX analysis was also performed on three
additional spots in this nanocrystallite layer, and the P content was
found to be 5–7 at.%, with an average of 6.5 at.%. The measurement
error was ±0.5%. The thickness of this interfacial layer ranged from
50 to 100 nm. It is worth noting that in our previous study, P co-
deposition was not observed in an electroplated Ni substrate [7].
Thus, it was apparent that P was supplied from the Sn4Ag0.5Cu sol-
der ball and trapped at this interface. The concentration of P was

analysis of student’s t-test. The amount of P in the Sn4Ag0.5Cu sol-
der had no effect on the solder joint strength after three cycles of
reﬂow.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effect of P on the interfacial reaction
The IMC resulting from the reaction of undoped Sn4Ag0.5Cu with
electrolytic Ni had a chunky morphology. This morphology became
planar when the P concentration in the Sn4Ag0.5Cu exceeded
100 ppm. The change in the IMC morphology with the P content
suggested reduction of the undercooling temperature during solid-
iﬁcation. Different groups [5,12–14] have reported on the effect of
adding minor alloying elements on the undercooling phenomenon;
some [4,10,12,13] reported an increase in the IMC layer thickness,
but others [5,14] reported the opposite result. The increase in the
IMC layer thickness strongly depended on the type of alloying ele-
ment and its content being added. Our data showed that the IMC
growth was suppressed by the introduction of P into the Sn4Ag0.5-
Cu solder. It is interesting to note that other Group 15 elements af-
fect IMC growth in a similar manner: Sb [3,8–11,14] suppresses
IMC growth, and Bi inhibits Cu3Sn growth [8,9]. However, there
is no information the effect of As alloying, as this element is too
toxic to be used. Thus far, we ﬁnd that among Group 15 elements,
P, Sb, and Bi inhibit IMC growth.
Chen and Li [14] studied the effect of Sb in solders and found that
the IMC layer thickness decreasedwith increasing Sb concentration.
They suggested that IMC formation involved heterogeneous nucle-
ation owing to the high afﬁnity of Sb for Sn, which suppressed the
reaction with Cu. Comparison of the IMC morphologies of the P-
doped and undoped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joints in the BF-TEM images
in Figs. 3 and 4 showed that the undoped IMC had a chunky
morphology, while the IMC in the P-doped (100 ppm) solder joint
contained multiple (Ni,Cu)6Sn5 nodules stacked on one another.
We postulated that this stacking might have resulted from the indi-
vidual (Ni,Cu)6Sn5 grains formed in the molten Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder in
the vicinity of the substrate. Upon cooling, supersaturation of Ni and
Cu in the Snmatrix occurred, and this caused deposition of the (Ni,-
Cu)6Sn5 nodules on the existing grains [17]. However, we need to
conﬁrmwhether the abovementioned phenomenon is due to heter-
ogeneous nucleation or homogeneous nucleation. Therefore, more
detailed experiments must be performed in this regard.
To understand the suppressing effect of P on IMC growth in de-
tail, the 100-ppm-P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint was subjected to
Fig. 5. (a) Effects of P (ppm) content in the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint on the tensile

time and peak temperature, Do (105 cm2 s1 [27,28]), T (508 K), t
(35 s), and kB (8.314  103 kJ mol1 K1 [25]) are constants. Com-
parison of Eqs. (1) and (4) clearly shows that P is a function of acti-
vation energy. In this case,

where, ko and n are constants. The relationship between DH and P
follows the power law. The analysis shows that an increase in P in-
creases the activation energy accordingly. Hence, in the P-doped
Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder, the effective D decreases at high DH, supporting
our hypothesis that some amount of energy is consumed for releas-
ing P during IMC formation and a relatively thin layer of the IMC is
formed.
Fig. 6a shows the relationship between x and e. At higher IMC
layer thicknesses, the tensile strain stabilize and showing the origin
mechanical properties of Sn4Ag0.5Cu at a given reﬂow conditions.
However, once the IMC layer thickness falls below a certain level,
the tensile strain decreases signiﬁcantly, and the fracture mode
changes from ductile to brittle. This behavior is related to the pres-
ence of nanocrystallites at the interface. Fig. 6b shows the plot
(straight line) of tensile strain and the logarithmical value of IMC
layer thickness. The correlation of both experimental data, the sta-
tistical regression R2 = 0.992, which is a good ﬁt to the power law.
The fracture strength has been reported to be high at a low IMC
layer thickness [29]. The results of the present study, too, indicated
that a thin IMC layer does enhance the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint
strength, as shown in Table 1. The P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint
had a thin IMC layer, and hence, the joint strength increased. The
tensile strength of the P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint increased
as compared to that of the undoped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint, owing
to the hardening of the nanocrystallites. The change of tensile
strength of P-doped and undoped Sn4Ag0.5Cu between the ﬁrst
and third reﬂow cycles is shown in last column of the table. The
percentages of change were 27.27% (undoped), 34.63% (50-ppm
P-doped), 34.63% (100-ppm P-doped) and 33.48% (500-ppm P-
doped). By comparing the level of change using statistical analysis
of student’s t-test method, the solder joint strength of P-doped
Sn4Ag0.5Cu dropped at a higher level. The fact that decreasing the
IMC layer thickness would increase the joint strength has been
widely reported [29–31]. However, after a large number of reﬂow
cycles, the strength of the P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint de-
creased at a level higher than that of the undoped Sn4Ag0.5Cu sol-
der joint. A higher percentage (40%) of brittle fracture was found
in the 500-ppm-P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint. The reduction in
the tensile strength after three reﬂow cycles is hypothesized to
be caused by two factors. One is the brittle nature of the nanocrys-
tallites, which are made up of (Ni,Cu)3P. After three reﬂow cycles,
the layer has less interfacial integrity because of thermal expansion
and contraction. The other is the inhibition of IMC growth by the
pinning of Cu, Ni, Sn, and P at the grain boundaries. This would re-
sult in high interfacial stress, which in turn triggers fracture upon
pulling.
On the basis of the abovementioned ﬁndings, we state that
introduction of P into the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder system would inhibit
oxidation of the solder [6,15] and result in the formation of a bar-
rier layer that suppress IMC growth. However, when the P content
exceeds 100 ppm, a lower tensile strain is observed and the
Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint becomes more brittle. In addition, the
strengthening effect disappears after three reﬂow cycles. Thus, it
is suggested that the P concentration in Sn4Ag0.5Cu be maintained
below 100 ppm and that suppression of IMC growth is important
for regulating the rate of diffusion. Suppression of IMC growth
via maintaining the low P content is particularly useful for sup-
pressing the growth of Kirkendall voids during the reaction of
the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder with electroless Ni–P [2,3,6,7].
5. Conclusions
In summary, introduction of P into the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder pro-
duced an interfacial layer of nanocrystallites between (Ni,Cu)6Sn5
and (Cu,Ni)3Sn4. This layer, which was deduced to be (Ni,Cu)3P,
was brittle and effectively suppressed the growth of the IMC. Un-
der a given set of reﬂow conditions, IMC growth and the maximum
tensile strain were inversely proportional to the P concentration.
The higher the P content, the greater would be the activation en-
ergy. This phenomenon was attributed to the pinning of P, Sn, Ni,
and Cu at the grain boundaries of (Ni,Cu)6Sn5 and (Cu,Ni)3Sn4.
Initially, the tensile strength of the P-doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder
joint increased. However, this strengthening effect was lost after
multiple reﬂow cycles, and the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder joint was more
likely to undergo brittle fracture in the tensile test. On the basis
of the mechanical properties and the diffusion barrier in the P-
doped Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder, we state that it is possible to control
the rate of the solder–substrate reaction by optimizing the P con-
centration in Sn4Ag0.5Cu. Hence, the growth of Kirkendall voids
in the solder joint can be controlled effectively.

Ni12P5, Ni2P, Ni2SnP, and Ni3Sn4 [14,16,18,22]. Initially,
however, it was unclear whether the IMC was Ni2SnP
[15,16,19–22], Ni3SnP [23] or Ni55Sn35P10 [24,25]. Kang
et al. [20] subsequently identiﬁed the compound as Ni2SnP
by using hot-stage transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). During interfacial reactions, two types of voids
formed: one type is formed in the Ni2SnP region and the
other in the Ni3P region. Depending on their density, the
voids potentially aﬀect the strength of the solder joints
and produced brittle fracture at the interface between
Ni2SnP and Ni3Sn4. Most researchers believe that brittle
fracture occurs in theNi3P voids. Extensive studies havebeen
conducted on the Ni3P column voids [7,11–14,16,17,26–28].
However, in most cases, the interface cracking was not at
Ni3P voids, but in the thin Ni2SnP layer [11,12,22,29,30].
Very few studies have investigated these Ni2SnP voids in
detail because of the need for advanced TEM techniques
to analyze nanoscale voids [22,26]. In most previous studies,
the formation of these voids has been attributed to the Kir-
kendall eﬀect [20–22,25,27]. Laurila and Vourinen [11],
Vourinen et al. [24], and Kang et al. [19] observed voids in
Ni2SnP during reﬂow carried out for less than 60 s. Kang
et al. [19] suggested that these voids were Kirkendall voids,
but Laurila, Vourinen and co-workers proposed two other
hypotheses [11,13,24]. One was that the voids were caused
by organic residue resulting from non-optimization of the
plating bath, and the other was that the voids were caused
by supersaturation of P in Sn, which is present between
Ni–P and the molten solder. However, these hypotheses
have not been validated experimentally.
In this study, the formation of voids in Ni2SnP during
reﬂow is investigated. The objective of this study is to elu-
cidate the mechanism of void formation and investigate the
associated phenomena. An ENIG substrate with medium P
content is reﬂowed with Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu at diﬀerent reﬂow
peak temperatures and cycles. Void evolution and void
density are then recorded and presented. The results show
that the voids in Ni2SnP are caused by the plating process
and that they coalesce with an increase in the number of
reﬂow cycles and the peak temperature. However, the void
density increases as the number of reﬂow cycles increases.
These coalesced voids are responsible for interfacial frac-
ture. The mechanism of formation of these Ni2SnP voids
is then discussed.
2. Experimental procedure
The ENIG substrate was ﬁrst analyzed by TEM (JEOL
JEM-2100F, operated at 200 keV) to understand the initial
plating structure. The P content of the Ni layer was
between 5 and 9 wt.%. A focused ion beam (FIB) was used
to fabricate a 70–90 nm thin section of the sample. Energy-
dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to study the
sample composition. The beam size in EDX was 2 nm.
As-plated ENIG substrates were printed with a layer of
water-soluble ﬂux. A Sn3Ag0.5Cu solder ball (diameter:
0.75 mm) was then placed on the substrates. The assemblies
were reﬂowed in an oven with ten heating zones at ambient
oxygen levels (20 ppm). The temperature diﬀerence within
the assemblies in the reﬂow chamber was less than
1 C cm1, as determined by thermocouple measurement.
During reﬂow, the specimen heated at 230 C for 30 s
was removed from the oven and rapidly quenched by
immersion in an ice bath (time:5 s) to freeze the interfacial
reaction [31].
The assemblies were subsequently reﬂowed at 230 C,
240 C, and 250 C peak reﬂow temperature for 60 s above
the liquidus temperature (217 C). Samples reﬂowed at
250 C for 60 s were subjected to multiple reﬂow cycles,
i.e. up to ten cycles. The samples subject to diﬀerent sets
of reﬂow conditions were analyzed for measurement of
the interfacial void density. The ﬁeld emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) images
(micrographs) of the samples were obtained under the same
magniﬁcation.
3. Results
3.1. As-plated substrate
Fig. 1 shows the nanovoids and Ni crystals at the inter-
face between Au and Ni–P. The size of the nanovoids was
2–4 nm, as observed by bright-ﬁeld TEM (BF-TEM).
At a medium P content, Ni nanocrystals were identiﬁed at
the interface. Since several research groups have reported
the formation of such Ni nanocrystals [7,8,10,18,32,33],
we have excluded this topic from the present study. The
voids’ size could be changed by tilting the sample inside
the TEM chamber. EDX analysis was performed on the
Ni–P region, and the calculated compositions were as
follows: Ni, 81–85 wt.% (83–90 at.%) and P, 5–9 wt.%
(10–16 at.%). No organic compounds were detected.

9 wt.% on a Ni layer.

4.2. Evolution of voids during reﬂow
During reﬂow soldering, the nanovoids eﬀervesced
because of vapor pressure diﬀerence [36] and the dissolution
of Au and Ni [11–14,34]. Lin et al. [34] showed that during
reﬂow, the dissolution zones contained many vacancies that
possibly originated at this interface between immersion Au
and electroless Ni as found in Fig. 1. Upon cooling, solidi-
ﬁcation of the IMC [31,34] occurred, and these vacancies
were trapped to result in the formation of voids, as shown
in Fig. 2. The size of the voids increased to 7 nm, which
was almost twice the original size, indicating coalescence
of the vacancies to form larger voids. Kang et al. [19,21] also
reported that the voids in the Ni2SnP were attributed to the
vacancies accumulated after reﬂow at 255 C for 60 s. How-
ever, they did not ﬁnd such voids during reﬂow at 255 C for
3 s and suggested that these voids were Kirkendall voids. In
contrast, these voids were found during reﬂow at 230 C at
30 s in the present study. The diﬀerence between our results
and Kang et al.’s results could be because of the diﬀerence in
the experimental methods adopted.
During the IMC formation [31,34], interdiﬀusion
betweenNi and Sn atoms occurred; as a result, the vacancies
were aligned to form a series of voids instead of randomly
distributed voids. Some researchers presumed that these
were Kirkendall voids [19–22,27,29], while some others
stated that these were liquid miscibility gaps [13,15,21], as
Kirkendall voids cannot be formed in a short reﬂow time
because of the diﬀusion process. On the basis of these results
and the results published previously, the nanovoids were
conﬁrmed to be formed in an as-plated substrate (Fig. 1).
Large vacancies were observed by Lin [34] during the early
stages of reﬂow. These voids were trapped and aligned in
Ni2SnP (Fig. 2). The void density did not change with the
reﬂow time (Fig. 3d). Therefore, we suggested that these
voids in Ni2SnP originated from the miscibility gaps formed
during plating.
4.3. Eﬀect of number of reﬂow cycles on voids and fracture
As shown in Fig. 4, the voids coalesced to form a void
line with an increase in the number of reﬂow cycles. Ini-
tially, void density increased slowly, became constant,
and ﬁnally saturated at 24 voids lm1. At saturation,
the voids were linked to each other over the entire interface
(Fig. 4e). Chin et al. [37] showed that the percentage of
brittle fracture after four reﬂow cycles was high. Because
of the linkage of these voids, the interface weakened and
brittle fracture occurred. With repeated reﬂow cycles, the
size of the voids increased to 18 nm. Zeng and Tu [12] sta-
ted that the voids can grow to 1 lm after 256 min of reﬂow.
This is the Kirkendall eﬀect.
The voids in the Ni3P region elongated toward the bulk
solder. The voids were attributed to Ni diﬀused from
Ni–P. Fabber et al. [8] showed that Ni–P is an amorphous
compound and that P in the Ni region basically connected

4.5. Kinetics of nanovoid evolution
To describe the evolution of these voids, we applied the
John–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) theory and
modeled the void growth from nucleation to coalescence.
In the JMAK theory, the nucleation and coalescence of
voids are due to diﬀusion with no chemical reaction
[41–43]. The fractional connecting voids, X(t), to the entire
interfacial line is given as

Sn–0.6Cu solder bath at 250 ± 2 C for 20 min to grow a
layer of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5. As shown in Figure 1a, (Cu,-
Ni)6Sn5 is the stable compound in equilibrium with
Sn–0.6Cu. The solder baths used in this study were pre-
pared from 99.999% pure Cu and 99.99% pure Sn. Each
solder bath was formed by placing 6.0 g of solder into a
10 mm ID vial. Nickel substrates, 9 mm  9 mm 
0.4 mm in dimension and 99.99% pure, were used to re-
act with the solder. Before the reaction, each Ni sub-
strate was ﬂuxed with a mildly activated rosin ﬂux.
Each substrate was then vertically inserted into a fresh
molten solder bath and reacted for 20 min. In step B,
the bulk of the Sn–0.6Cu was ﬁrst mechanically polished
away, and then the remaining Sn–0.6Cu was completely
etched away using an acid solution. The substrate along
with the newly formed intermetallic was then dipped
into a fresh Sn–0.3Cu solder bath with a 6.0 g mass (step
C1). When the solder composition is Sn–0.3Sn, (Cu,
Ni)6Sn5 is not in equilibrium with the solder, as pre-
dicted by Figure 1a, and massive spalling may occur.
To make sure the potential spalling was not caused by
damage generated during the solder removal, a step
C2 was added, in which the new solder bath had the
same composition as the original one (Sn–0.6Cu and
6.0 g).
As shown in Figure 2a 2–3 lm layer of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
formed at the interface, The Ni/(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 interface
was quite planar, but the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5/solder interface
was not planar: there were (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 needles protrud-
ing into the solder. The formation of only (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
after step A was as expected according to the literature
results [2,10] as well as according to Figure 1a. In step
B, a selective Sn etching solution was used to remove
the original solder. The resulting microstructure is
shown in Figure 2b, where it can be seen that there
was no clear evidence of damage to (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 during
the etching. The X-ray diﬀraction pattern shown in the
inset of Figure 2b was obtained from a specimen
immediately after step B. The identity of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
was conﬁrmed by this result as well as by microprobe
compositional measurements.
After step C1, the specimens were reacted at
250 ± 2 C for diﬀerent periods of time. As shown in
Figure 3a, after only 1 min of exposure to Sn–0.3Cu, a

Grain boundary penetration
a b s t r a c t
The reaction between high-Pb solders and Ni substrate was investigated to understand the Sn concentra-
tion effect on the formation of intermetallic compounds. Three PbxSn solders (x=1, 3, and 5wt.%) were
reacted with Ni substrates at 400 ◦C for 2–240min. The reaction products formed at the interface were
related to the Sn concentration in the solders.When the Sn concentrationwas 5wt.%, Ni3Sn4 formed ﬁrst
and followed by the formation of Ni3Sn2. When the Sn concentration decreased to 3wt.%, Ni3Sn2 formed
ﬁrst and followed by the formation of Ni3Sn.When the Sn concentration became 1wt.%, only Ni3Sn2 was.
This fascinating concentration dependency was rationalized by using the Pb–Sn–Ni isotherm. In addi-
tion, the deep penetration of Pb into the Ni substrate along the grain boundaries was observed. It was
likely that the low interfacial energy between high-Pb and Ni caused such an unusual grain boundary
penetration.

1. Introduction
Nickel-basedunder bumpmetallizations (UBM) arewidely used
in microelectronics packaging to prevent excessive intermetallic
formation during processing and during operation of electronic
devices [1–4]. High-Pb solders, such as 95Pb5Sn (wt.%, samebelow)
are among the most widely used solders in ﬂip–chip solder joints,
and are currently exempt from the lead-free requirements for uses
in ﬂip–chip applications. The formation of a thin intermetallic layer
between the solder and theUBM is desirable to achieve a goodmet-
allurgical bond; however, excessive growth of intermetallic layer
may have deleterious effects. Often, the intermetallic layer is brittle
andmaydegrade themechanical properties of solder joints, leading
to poor reliability of electronic devices [5,6]. In particular, Ni3Sn4
was found to be very brittle, and factures through this compound
developed easily regardless its thickness [6]. Therefore, an under-
standing of interfacial reaction between solders and Ni-based UBM
is necessary for improving the reliability of electronic products. The
objective of this study is to investigate the reactions between Ni
substrate and high-Pb solders with different Sn concentrations.
2. Experimental
Pure Ni substrates (99.99wt.%) of 25mm×10mm×4mm dimensions were
mechanically mirror-polished on both faces to reduce the surface roughness, fully
immersed into dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) to remove Ni oxide on the Ni surface,

then quickly spread with a commercial mildly activated rosin ﬂux. Solder alloys of
three different compositions, 99Pb1Sn, 97Pb3Sn, and 95Pb5Sn, were prepared by
ﬁrst melting high purity (99.99%) elements and then placing in a furnace at 300 ◦C
for 1 week for alloy homogenization. Each ﬂuxed Ni substrate was immersed in a
freshmolten solder bath kept at 400 ◦C for 2–240min. The amount of solder used in
each soldering reaction was 12g.
The soldered samples were further sliced for solder/substrate interfacial
examination. After conventional metallographic grinding, the ion-milling polisher
(E-3500;HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan)was used for ﬁnal polishing. The ion-milling polish-
ing has the beneﬁt of less preparation damage and does not require surface etching
by any chemical reagents. The compositions of the phases were determined by
an electron probe micro-analyzer (FE-EPMA; JXA-8500F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with
average value ofmeasurements fromﬁve different regions in the intermetallic layer.
3. Results
Fig. 1(a)–(c) shows a series of cross-sectional microstructure in
backscattered electron mode for the 95Pb5Sn solder reacted with
Ni at 400 ◦C for 2, 20 and 240min, respectively. As can be seen in
Fig. 1(a), a thin intermetallic layer formed at the interface, but its
thickness was too thin to be accurately analyzed with FE-EPMA.
From the results at longer reaction time, it was presumed to be
Ni3Sn4. When the time reached 20min, there was still only one
intermetallic, and this compound was positively identiﬁed by FE-
EPMAtobeNi3Sn4.Meanwhile, a fewvoidswereobservedbetween
Ni3Sn4 and Ni, as shown in Fig. 1(b). When the soldering time
reached to 240min, both Ni3Sn4 and Ni3Sn2 were identiﬁed by FE-
EPMA. The contrast betweenNi3Sn4 andNi3Sn2 was veryweak, and
thin dashed lines are added in Fig. 1(c) and (d) to help delineate
these two compounds. As shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), there were
both voids and high-Pb phase (Pb) between Ni3Sn2 and Ni. Since

Fig. 4. Pb-rich corner of the Pb–Sn–Ni ternary isotherm at 400 ◦C. This isothermwas
redrawn based on the information determined by Tu and Zeng [8].
According to the Ni–Sn binary phase diagram [7], there were
three stable intermetallic compounds, Ni3Sn, Ni3Sn2 and Ni3Sn4,
thatmight format the interface of binaryNi–Sn reaction at temper-
atures below 400 ◦C. For reactions in the PbSn/Ni ternary system,
one needs to use the Pb–Sn–Ni isotherm at 400 ◦C, reproduced in
Fig. 4 [8], as a reference map for discussion. In this study, when
the Sn concentration was 5wt.%, the Ni3Sn4 formed as the ﬁrst
intermetallic compound, and then Ni3Sn2 formed next to Ni3Sn4
at 240min (see Fig. 1). When the Sn concentration was 3wt.%, the
ﬁrst phase formed became Ni3Sn2, and then Ni3Sn formed next
to Ni3Sn4 at 240min (see Fig. 2). When the Sn concentration was
1wt.%, the ﬁrst phase formed becameNi3Sn2, andNi3Sn2 remained
the only phase formed for reaction time as long as (see Fig. 3). For all
the solder compositions used in this study, the ﬁrst phase formed
was consistent with the prediction of the Pb–Sn–Ni isotherm (see
Fig. 4). In the 95Pb5Sn/Ni reaction, the Ni3Sn4 phase formed ﬁrst,
and now the interface represented a tie-line in the Ni3Sn4 + (Pb)
two-phase ﬁeld in the Pb–Sn–Ni isotherm shown in Fig. 4. When
the Sn concentration in solder was 3wt.% or 1wt.%, the interface
represented a tie-line in the Ni3Sn2 + (Pb) two-phase ﬁeld, and
therefore, Ni3Sn2 formed ﬁrst next to the high-Pb solder. The ﬁrst
phase formed in the case of 95Pb5Sn is also consistent with the
work of Lin and Jang [9].
As shown in Fig. 1(c), a voids + (Pb) region formed between
Ni3Sn2 and Ni when the reaction timewas long. Such amicrostruc-
ture was quite similar to the massive spalling reported in the
literature [10–17]. According to the theory of massive spalling
[14–17], the massive spalling phenomenon is a process through
which the interface responds to the shifting of the equilibrium
phase. The massive spalling occurs because the original reaction
product at the interface is no longer in local thermodynamic equi-
librium with the solder, and this compound spalls away to make
room for the nucleation and growth of the equilibriumphase. How-
ever, aspointedout earlier, theSnconcentration in this studywould
not change during the reaction because the supply of Sn was very
large. Consequently, the formation of the voids + (Pb) region must
be explained by another reason other than the massive spalling
phenomenon.
Themost likely explanation for the formation of the voids + (Pb)
region is the interfacial energy effect. In fact, the penetration Ni
grain boundaries by puremolten Pb had been reported at high tem-
peratures (> 600 ◦C) [18,19]. They attributed this grain boundary

penetration to the effect of low interfacial energy between molten
Pb and Ni. The penetration started with the liquid grooving at the
grain boundaries of exposed Ni surface [18,19]. In order to conﬁrm
whether the voids + (Pb) region was related to the grain boundary
penetration reported at high temperatures (>600 ◦C) [18,19]. An
experiment was carried out by reacting pure Pb with Ni at 400 ◦C
for 240min. The same experimental procedure as the other exper-
iments of this study was used. Fig. 5 shows the interface of the
reaction between pure Pb and Ni substrate at 400 ◦C for 240min.
It can clearly be seen that the Ni grain boundaries were decorated
with awhitephase. Thiswhitephasewas in fact themoltenpurePb.
In other words, Pb had penetrated into Ni along grain boundaries.
Suchobservationwas verydifﬁcultwithout resorting to ion-milling
polishing technique. This is the ﬁrst time that grain boundary pene-
trationofPb intoNi isobservedat sucha lowtemperature. Fig. 5also
shows that theNi surface exposed to bulk of themolten Pbwas very
rough. In other words, molten Pb was able to break up the initially
smooth Ni surface. This feature was similar to the microstructure
of Ni substrate in 95Pb5Sn/Ni reaction at 400 ◦C for 240min, shown
in Fig. 1(d). Therefore, it is proposed that the voids between inter-
metallic layer and Ni were in fact originally occupied by the (Pb).
These (Pb) penetrated intoNi along grain boundaries during solder-
ing reaction, leaving behind those voids. These voids might also be
the reason why NiSn compounds were reported to be quite weak
in the literature [6]. The observation of this deep grain boundary
penetration suggests that high-Pb solders are not compatible with
Ni substrates. The combination of these two materials should be
used in great caution.
5. Conclusions
The types of Ni–Sn intermetallic compounds formed in high-
Pb/Ni soldering reaction at 400 ◦C were related to the Sn
concentration. When the Sn concentration was 5wt.%, Ni3Sn4
formed ﬁrst, and then Ni3Sn2 formed between Ni3Sn4 and Ni.
When the Sn concentration decreased to 3wt.%, the ﬁrst compound
formedwas Ni3Sn2, and then Ni3Sn formed between Ni3Sn2 and Ni
when the time increased. When the Sn concentration was 1wt.%,
only Ni3Sn2 formed. This fascinating concentration dependency
was rationalized by using the Pb–Sn–Ni isotherm.
Since the interfacial energy between molten Pb-rich phase and
Ni was very low. The molten Pb-rich phase was able to penetrate
into the interface between the intermetallic compound and the Ni
substrate, creating the massive spalling phenomenon. When the
reaction time was long enough, the Pb-rich phase was even able
to wet the Ni grain boundaries, and penetrated deep into the grain
boundaries. This suggests that high-Pb solders are not compatible
with Ni substrates. The combination of these two materials should
be used in great caution.

This letter reports a RuNx-bearing Cu layer that has the potential to replace both thewetting layer and the
diffusion barrier layer in the conventional under bumpmetallurgy of ﬂip-chip solder joints. This Cu–RuNx
composite layer was deposited by reactive co-sputtering of Cu and Ru in N2 atmosphere. Experimental
characterizations show that Cu–RuNx exhibits comparable solderability to pure Cu. Most importantly,
Cu–RuNx has a dissolution rate at least one order of magnitude slower than that of pure Cu. A single layer
exhibiting these two attributes might offer substantial advantage in cost reduction.

The under bump metallurgy (UBM) of a ﬂip-chip solder joint
serves the key role of establishing a highly reliable linkage between
the Si chip and the solder bump. The UBM has to exhibit both
proper solderability and sufﬁcient barrier capability against sol-
dering reaction. To meet these two requirements, UBM typically
consists of several metal layers, including one metal layer, such as
Cu, for solderability (wetting layer), and another layer, such as Ni,
for resistance against excessive soldering reaction (barrier layer)
[1,2]. An inner adhesion layer, such as Ti, is also commonly used.
Such a multi-layer stack inevitably raises cost, and there is a need
to reduce the number of layers to a minimum. In other words, it is
desirable to ﬁnd a metal layer that can serve more than one func-
tions. In this letter, an advanced RuNx-bearing Cu layer that has the
potential to replace both the wetting layer and the barrier layer is
reported.
The detailed procedure for preparing the composite layer of Cu
and RuNx had been reported elsewhere [3], and is omitted here.
The Cu–RuNx composite layer was prepared by co-sputtering Cu
(99.999% pure) and Ru (99.99%) targets on (100) Si wafer in the
atmosphere of Ar–10% N2 mixture gas. The overall composition of
theﬁlmwasdetermined to be0.4 at.% Ru and1.7 at.%N (balanceCu)
byusing secondary ionmass spectroscopy [3]. Brightﬁeld transmis-
sion electronmicroscopy analysis [3] showed that the Cumatrix in
the Cu–RuNx composite layer exhibited a columnar structure with

an average10nmcrystallite size (see Fig. 4 of Ref. [3]). X-raydiffrac-
tion analysis showed that Ru had reacted with N2 to form a RuNx
compound [3,4].
In addition to this Cu–RuNx composite layer, experiments were
also carried out by using electroplated Cu layer for comparison.
For the solderability evaluation, three types of solders, Sn–37Pb,
Sn–9Zn and Sn–3Ag–0.5Cu (wt.%) were selected. The solderabil-
ity was evaluated by measuring the spreading areas of each solder
over the Cu–RuNx composite layer and the electroplated Cu layer.
The solder spheres were allowed to spread over the substrates for
20 s at 240 ◦C,which is a typical peak reﬂow temperature employed
by industry. In this study, the spreading of solder was uniform in
all directions, producing spherical capmorphology. Such a uniform
spreading is critical to generate reproducible reading of the spread-
ing area. Our experience is that if the substrates are clean, ﬂat, and,
most importantly, relatively oxide-free, then the spreading will be
quite uniform. Excessive oxide on the substrate is the number one
reason for non-uniform spreading. For evaluation on the soldering
reaction, the sessile drop method was used. Solder balls of 760m
in diameter and Sn–3Ag–0.5Cu in composition were placed onto
the Cu–RuNx or Cu substrates, and kept at a constant temperature
of 240 ◦C for different periods of time. The thickness of thedissolved
Cu–RuNx substrate or Cu substrate was determined by measuring
the vertical distance between the substrate surface that was cov-
ered by solder and the surface thatwas not covered by solder of the
same specimen.
The spreading ratios of the solders on pure Cu and Cu–RuNx
substrates are shown in Fig. 1. The spreading ratio is deﬁned as the

tion product was observed. In addition, no gap between the solder
and Cu–RuNx was observed. It was always possible that a certain
reaction product existed but was simply too thin to be resolved by
the ﬁeld emission scanning electronmicroscope used in this study.
Under this situation, the thin reaction product provided the adhe-
sionbetween the solder andCu–RuNx. A secondpossibilitywas that
the reaction product indeed did not form. Under this situation, the
adhesion between the solder and Cu–RuNx was provided by the
direct metallic bonds between the solder and Cu–RuNx.
The consumption rate of Cu–RuNx was also very low during
high temperature aging process. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the thick-
ness Cu–RuNx remained almost unchanged even after 1000h at
200 ◦C. A resulting interfacial image after 1000h aging is shown in
Fig. 5(b). The Cu–RuNx layer remained stable, and no intermetal-
lic compound was observed at the interface. It is quite surprising
that no reaction product was observed even after such a long
period of thermal aging. Moreover, the adhesion between solder
and the Cu–RuNx layer remained excellent. As had been pointed
out in a previous study [3], the Cu–RuNx ﬁlm had an excel-
lent thermal stability and adhesion to Si, having the capability
of withstanding 680 ◦C annealing for at least 1h. This seems to
suggest that the Cu–RuNx ﬁlm is an inherently very stable mate-
rial. There is no previous report in literature that ally addition
to Cu of a few atomic percent is able to completely inhibit the
formation of any intermetallic compound at the interface. The
exact mechanism for this behaviour is unclear at this moment,
and more detailed study is required to resolve this rather novel
phenomenon.
In summary, it was demonstrated that the sputter-deposited
Cu–RuNx layer exhibited a very low reactivity with either molten
solder or solid solder. The dissolution rate of this layer is as low as
that of Ni. No intermetallic compound was observed at the inter-
face with the solder even after long period of solid state aging at
200 ◦C. In addition, Cu–RuNx exhibits adequate wetting to solder
and has solderability comparable to pure Cu. A single metallisa-
tion layer simultaneously exhibiting these two properties has the
potential to replace both the wetting layer and the barrier layer,
and offers substantial advantage in cost reduction. Uncovering the
mechanism for its low reactivity to solders and evaluating the joint
strength are two areas that need further investigation.

lution will be studied using solders joints of several different sizes.
To achieve the objective, three parameters: (1) the initial Cu con-
centration in solder, (2) the number of reﬂow, and (3) the solder
ball size are studied.
2. Experimental
The schematic drawing of the solders joint used in this study is shown in Fig. 1.
Solderballs of fourdifferent compositions Sn3AgxCu (x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7wt.%) and four
different diameters (djoint), 400, 500, 760, and 960m, were employed to study the
inﬂuenceof theCuconcentrationand the solder volume. The solder volumeratios for
the 400, 500, 760, and 960mballs are approximately 1:2:7:14. The soldering pads
of the substrates used in this study had an OSP surface ﬁnish over the electroplated
Cu layer. The pad-opening diameter (dpad) was ﬁxed at 600m. Using solder balls
of four different sizes over the substrates of a single size allowed one to investigate
the effect of solder volume in a well-controlled manner.
Before soldering, every substrate was ﬂuxed with a mildly activated rosin ﬂux,
and the solder ballswere then planted on the soldering pads. The reﬂowproﬁle used
had a peak reﬂow temperature of 235±2 ◦C and a 90 s duration during which the
solder was molten. The nominal ramp rate and cooling rate were both 1.5 ◦C/s. The
number of reﬂow cycles was from one to ﬁve times.
After soldering, the samples were mounted in epoxy, and polished to reveal
the interfaces and internal microstructures. The samples were then etched with a
5vol.% HCl (in methanol) solution for a few seconds to reveal the cross-sectional
microstructures. The etchant for the top-view micrographs was a 30vol.% HNO3
aqueous solution. The etching time depended on the thickness of the remaining
solder to be removed. The thickness of the intermetallic compounds (TIMC) formed
and the consumedCu layer thickness (TCu)wasmeasured by using an image analysis
software. The consumed Cu layer thickness was measured by comparing the un-
reacted Cu (which was protected by the solder mask, see Fig. 1) and the reacted Cu
from the same solder joint.
The reaction zone for each solder joint was examined by using a scanning elec-
tron microscope (SEM). The composition of the reaction product was identiﬁed by
a state-of-the-art ﬁeld-emission electron probemicroanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-
8500F) operated at 15keV. During microprobe measurements, the detected X-rays
were K, L, and L for Cu, Ag, and Sn, respectively. In microprobe analysis, the
concentrations of each elementweremeasured independently, and the total weight
percentage was within 100±1wt.% in each case. For every data point, at least four
measurements were made and the average value was reported.
3. Results
For all the experimental conditions (different solder composi-
tions, different ball sizes, and different numbers of reﬂow) used in
this study, there was only one reaction product, Cu6Sn5, formed at
the interface. The other common Cu–Sn compound, Cu3Sn, was not
detected between Cu and Cu6Sn5. This observation was consistent
with previous studies [7–22]. Higher temperatures or a longer time
than thoseused in this studywerenecessary inorder forCu3Sn tobe
detectable. In addition, noAg signalwas detected in Cu6Sn5 accord-
ing to the FE-EPMA analysis. Accordingly, it can be concluded that
Ag was not directly involved in the interfacial reaction.
The Cu6Sn5 microstructures after a single reﬂow for different
solder compositions are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). The compound
exhibited the classical scallop-type microstructure. This scallop-
type microstructure is typical from the reaction between Cu and
molten Sn-based solder. These scallops would transform into a
continuous, layered morphology after solid-state aging [14–16].
Fig. 2(a)–(d) shows that the total volume of Cu6Sn5 did not vary
strongly upon theCu content of the solder but the size of theCu6Sn5
scallops did increase with the Cu content. For the other solder ball
sizes (400, 500, and 960m), the trend was the same, and those
results are omitted for the sake of brevity. The reason for this size-
dependence on the initial Cu concentrationwill be discussed in the
Discussion section.

shown in Fig. 6(a),when the solder ballwas 760m, theﬁrst reﬂow
cycle consumed most Cu, but subsequent reﬂow cycles only con-
sumed relatively less Cu. As will be discussed later, only part of the
consumed Cu was converted into the Cu6Sn5 scallops, and the rest
of the consumed Cu was dissolved into the molten solder, raising
the Cu concentration to the point of saturation. In this study, the
saturationwas deﬁned as themaximum amount of copper that can
be dissolved in the liquid solder without precipitation of Cu6Sn5. In
other words, the saturation limit was related to the liquidus con-
centration of Cu–Sn binary if the role of Ag is ignored. It should be
noted that the saturation limit is a strong function of temperature,
as is apparent from the Cu–Sn binary phase diagram. This explains
why thesecondandhigher reﬂowsonlyconsumedmarginallymore
Cu (between 0.3 and 0.5m for each additional reﬂow). As shown
in Fig. 6(a), the amount of Cu consumed depended strongly on the
initial Cu concentration in solder, e.g. 10m for Sn3Ag after ﬁve
reﬂow cycles and about half the value for Sn3Ag0.7Cu. The effect
of ball size on the consumed Cu thickness is shown in Fig. 6(b). In
general, a large solder ball consumedmore Cu than its counterpart
with a smaller diameter. In fact, the largest ball (960m)consumed
more than twice the amount of Cu than the smallest ball (400m)
after ﬁve reﬂows. This trend can be understood by the fact that, for
a larger solder volume,more Cu atomswere needed to saturate the
molten solder.
4. Discussions
In this study, the effects of three parameters, initial Cu
concentration in the solder, number of reﬂow cycles, and the sol-
der volume, on the Cu dissolution behaviors were investigated.
Fig. 6. (a) Accumulated thickness of the consumed Cu for 760mballs plotted ver-
sus the number of reﬂow. (b) Accumulated thickness of the consumed Cu after ﬁve
reﬂows plotted versus the solder ball diameter.
Although the type of reaction product (Cu6Sn5) did not change
with these three parameters, those three parameters did have their
impacts on the Cu dissolution rate. Among these three parameters,
the Cu content is the most complicated one and deserves some
discussion before presenting other arguments.
The reason the initial Cu concentration being a complicated fac-
tor was because the Cu concentration in the solder did not stay
constant during the reﬂow process. As the Cu soldering pad was
consumed, the Cu atoms from the pad could either become Cu6Sn5
scallops or dissolve into the molten solder. Accordingly, the Cu
concentration deviated away from its initial value. The Cu concen-
tration can be estimated from the mass balance consideration for
the Cu atoms. We deﬁne the apparent Cu concentration wCu (in
wt.%) as the total amount of the Cu atoms in the solder divided by
the solder volume. These Cu atoms do not include those Cu atoms
incorporated into the Cu6Sn5 scallops attached to the interface, but
do include those from the Cu6Sn5 islands located inside the solder.
With this deﬁnition, from the mass balance of Cu, one obtains the
following equation:

1.2wt.% and TIMC = 2.5m (band lower limit) and wCu = 1.2 wt.% and TIMC = 5m
(band upper limit) for various djoint/dpad combinations.
With some simpliﬁcations, the results obtained in this study can
be used to predict the Cu consumed for real solder joints of various
sizes. Noting that wCu in Eq. (2) did not changemuch among differ-
ent solders anddifferentnumbersof reﬂow(Fig. 7),we take its value
as 1.2wt.% in the following discussion. Also noting that TIMC in Eq.
(2)was in the rangebetween2.5 and5m(Fig. 5), one can calculate
the bands of TCu for various combinations of w0Cu–djoint–dpad. The
lower limits and upper limits of the bandswere calculated by using
TIMC =2.5 and TIMC =5m, respectively. The results are plotted in
Fig. 8 for several commonly encountered djoint/dpad combinations
in electronic assemblies. Fig. 8 empirically predicts the consumed
Cu thickness during a typical reﬂow for real solder joints. Such
consumption rate information is crucial for designing Cu conduc-
tion traces with the minimum but reliable dimensions. It should
be noted that Fig. 8 is applicable to reﬂows with peak temperature
near 235 ◦C, because wCu in Eq. (2) depends on temperature.
5. Summary
For all the experimental conditions (Sn3Ag–Sn3Ag0.7Cu,
400–960msolder balls, and 1–5 reﬂow cycles) used in this study,
only Cu6Sn5, with the classical scallop-type morphology, formed
at the interface. The scallop sizes increased with increasing the ini-
tial Cu concentration, increasing the number of reﬂow cycles, and
decreasing the solder volume.
The consumed thickness of the Cu soldering pads increasedwith
decreasing the initial Cu concentration and increasing the soldering
volume. The ﬁrst reﬂow consumed the most Cu (3–9m, depend-
ing on the initial Cu concentration and the solder volume), and the
solder became saturated with Cu. Because of this saturation after
the ﬁrst reﬂow, subsequent reﬂows only consumed Cu marginally.
An empirical equation, which correlates the ball diameter, pad
diameter, and the initial Cu concentration, with the consumed Cu
thickness, is proposed. This equation can help in designing the Cu
conduction traces with the minimum but reliable dimensions.

50–80 nm for the bright ﬁeld image. For diﬀraction
mode studies the sample thickness was further ion
etched to about 30 nm.
Figure 1 is a TEM micrograph showing the interface
region between Cu and the solder quenched from a peak
temperature of 217.4 C. Both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn were
observed. The Cu3Sn layer was 80–90 nm thick, while
the Cu6Sn5 layer had a scalloped morphology. Even
though the solder was only partially molten at
217.4 C, both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn had formed. Figure
2 is a diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) cooling
curve showing two exothermic peaks at 173.2 and
186.2 C, which probably represent the transformation
from g0-Cu6Sn5 to g-Cu6Sn5. Similar thermal analysis
results were reported by Schaefer [10] and Umantsev
[18]. The results suggest that the nucleation of g0-Cu6Sn5
occurred before complete melting of the solder. Thus,
the ﬁndings indicate that g0-Cu6Sn5 nucleates heteroge-
neously and randomly irrespective of site [5,6,8,15,16]
prior to melting. The rapid formation of an e-Cu3Sn
layer (80–90 nm) in partially molten solder suggests that
the rates of nucleation and growth are very high [4,7,8]
in the liquid state. Tin atoms in the molten solder could
penetrate the Cu lattice at the atomic scale [19,20] due to
rapid diﬀusion [9–12]. In addition, Sn atoms preferen-
tially adsorbed to Cu nodules and interacted with solid
Cu atoms [21,22]. This interaction weakened the binding
energy between the attacked Cu atom and the neighbor-
ing Cu lattice. It helped in releasing Cu atoms from the
top surface of the Cu pad. Both Lord et al. [7] and Zur-
uzi et al. [12] reported such phenomenon of IMC
advancement into the Cu substrate. In the early stages
of soldering prior to IMC layer formation Sn assisted
this heterogeneous nucleation.
Figure 3 shows the interfaces between two Cu3Sn
grains and a g-Cu6Sn5 grain. This micrograph corre-
sponds to the region within the white square in Figure
1. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed a
Cu-enriched region (spots 3 and 4) at the phase bound-
ary of Cu3Sn and g-Cu6Sn5 (spots 2 and 1, respectively).
Within the Cu-enriched region, the Cu concentration
was 80.3–84.5 at.%, higher than that of Cu3Sn. The
thickness of this region was about 4–6 nm. Such a thick
interphase interface was rather unusual. Part of the rea-
son for this thick interface is likely the very large lattice
mismatch between Cu3Sn and a g-Cu6Sn5 [23]. The Cu
atoms within the Cu-enriched region came from the Cu
substrate by interphase boundary diﬀusion. These
Cu-enriched regions provided a fast diﬀusion channel
for Cu diﬀusion during the reaction between Cu and Sn.
Figure 4 is a HR-TEM micrograph of the interface
between the Sn4Ag0.5Cu solder and g-Cu6Sn5. Table
1 presents the respective EDX spots taken from this
micrograph. The Sn4.0Ag0.5Cu solder consisted of crys-
talline (spots 2 and 3) and amorphous (spot 1) regions.
The amorphous region was similar to the ﬁndings of
Pan et al. [15] and Yu et al. [6]. The diﬀerent lattice
orientations of g-Cu6Sn5 and Sn4Ag0.5Cu are indicated
by the arrows. At the interface between the solder and
g-Cu6Sn5 there is a 3–5 nm thick Cu-enriched region
(spots 4 and 6–8). This Cu-enriched region was presum-
ably connected from the Cu substrate to the Cu3Sn and
then to g-Cu6Sn5 before dissolving in the solder matrix.
The EDX spot 5 in Figure 4 shows a Cu/Sn atomic ratio
of 1.19, which corresponds to Cu6Sn5.

This  article  reports  on the  highly  interesting  microstructural  evolution  from  a ﬁne  eutectic  to  a coarse
laminar  pattern  caused  by  the  cycling  thermomechanical  stress  in  eutectic  PbSn  ﬂip-chip  solder  joints.
The  temperature  was  cycled  between  −55  and  125 ◦C  for  up to  2000  cycles.  The  shear  strain  on  the  corners
joints,  which  experienced  the  maximum  thermomechanical  stress  among  all the  solder  joints  in  a  ﬂip-
chip  package,  was  estimated  to be 0.13  for  each  cycle.  A  coarse  laminar  pattern,  made  up  of  the  Pb-rich
phase  and  the  Sn-rich  phase,  gradually  developed  during  the  temperature  cycling  with  phase  boundaries
that  were  approximately  parallel  to the direction  of  the  shear  stress.  It  is argued  that  the  laminar  pattern
had  developed  in such  a  manner  that  the  material  with  the  lowest  yield  stress  (the  Pb-rich  phase)  could
align  itself  with  the  direction  of  the  shear  stress.  Because  continuous  soft  layers  were  arranged  in a
direction  that was  approximately  parallel  to  the  direction  of the  shear  stress,  the  stored  deformation
energy  could  be  dissipated  more  efﬁciently.

1. Introduction
In low-cost ﬂip-chip technology, organic chip-carrier substrates
have almost completely replaced ceramic substrates because of
their substantial cost advantages over their ceramic counterparts.
It is estimated that 99% of the ﬂip-chip packages produced today
employ some type of organic substrate. Ceramic substrates are
still used only in highly critical applications such as for aerospace
and military uses. However, organic substrates present one major
drawback, which is the large mismatch in the coefﬁcients of ther-
mal  expansion between silicon and organic substrates [1].  Such a
mismatch makes ﬂip-chip packages particularly prone to thermo-
mechanical fatigue [2–5]. A temperature cycling test (TCT) is the
main tool used to identify package schemes that are susceptible to
failure due to thermomechanical fatigue.
In the literature, the mechanism of failure due to thermome-
chanical fatigue has been described in detail [6].  The objective of
this study is to investigate the microstructural evolution that takes
place during the time leading up to actual failure. In other words,
we investigate the microstructural changes that arise in response to
thermomechanical stress. More speciﬁcally, the highly interesting
microstructural evolution from a ﬁne eutectic to a coarse laminar
pattern is reported and discussed.

2. Experimental
A schematic drawing of the die and the organic substrate used in this study is
shown in Fig. 1(a). The detailed layout of each solder joint is shown schematically
in  Fig. 1(b). On the chip side, an outer under-bump-metallization (UBM) layer com-
posed of 3 m of Ni was in direct contact with the eutectic 37Pb63Sn (wt.%, same
below) solder bump which had a nominal diameter of 94 m.  The top metal layer
on  the soldering pads was electroplated Cu.
The dies and substrates were assembled by reﬂow. The reﬂow time, during
which the solder was molten, was 115 s. The peak reﬂow temperature was 240
(±2) ◦C. The nominal ramp and cooling rates were both 1.5 ◦C s−1.  After assembly,
the  specimens underwent high temperature annealing at 100 ◦C for 200 h in order to
pre-condition them. The purpose of this pre-conditioning treatment was to homog-
enize the microstructure of the solder joints so that all joints would possess a similar
initial microstructure.
The ﬂip-chip packages were then subjected to a temperature cycling test. The
temperature proﬁle for each cycle consisted of a 15 min  ramp-up from −55 to
125 ◦C, a 15 min  constant temperature of 125 ◦C, a 15 min  ramp-down from 125
to  −55 ◦C, and a 15 min  constant temperature of −55 ◦C. Taking into account the
coefﬁcients of thermal expansion for Si (2.6 × 10−6 K−1) and for the organic sub-
strate (15 × 10−6 K−1) [1],  we  calculated that the temperature difference between
the  high dwell temperature (125 ◦C) and the low dwell temperature (−55 ◦C) gen-
erated a maximum displacement of 12.6 m between the two  corner joints along
the  diagonal direction of the die, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). This displacement value
translated into a maximum apparent shear strain of 12.6/94 = 0.13 for the corner
joints. The corresponding thermal stress must have surpassed the yield stress of the
eutectic PbSn because extensive plastic deformation was observed in the joints.
In  order to observe their microstructural evolution, some of the ﬂip-chip pack-
ages were cross-sectioned along the centers of the ﬁrst-row solder joints. These
packages then underwent a TCT for a speciﬁc number of cycles, after which they were
examined under an electron microscope. After observation, these same packages
were subjected to further TCTs and subsequent observation. This kind of treatment
is  referred to as in situ TCT in this article.
After these TCT cycles, the specimens were mounted in epoxy and metal-
lographically polished to reveal the interface and the internal microstructure.

coarse laminar pattern. This coarse laminar pattern, made up of the
Pb-rich phase (white regions) and the Sn-rich phase (gray regions),
developed gradually during the temperature cycling and became
quite apparent after 1500 cycles. The laminar pattern was horizon-
tal with a thickness that ranged from 5 to 20 m.  During the early
stage (<100 cycles) of TCT, the development of the laminar pattern
was not apparent. A comparison between Figs. 2(b) and 3(a)–(c)
reveals that during this early stage of TCT, grain coarsening was  the
only apparent microstructural development. This coarsening pro-
cess continued throughout the TCT cycles, and the combined action
of the grain coarsening and the shear stress resulting from the mis-
match in the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion created this unique
coarse laminar pattern.
In order to understand the three-dimensional morphology of
the laminar pattern, the joint shown in Fig. 3(m)  was subjected
to a second cross-sectioning along a plane perpendicular to the
ﬁrst cross-section, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The
microstructure from this second cross-section is shown in Fig. 4(b).
A laminar pattern was also clearly visible along this direction. The
fact that the laminar pattern was  present in both directions sug-
gests that the morphology of the Pb-rich regions was in the form
of thin plate, instead of in the form of horizontal cylinder.
It should be noted that this laminar pattern formed in the cor-
ner bumps (bumps 1 and 36) and in the central bump (bump 18),
despite the difference in maximum shear strain developed during
each cycle (0.13 versus 0.095). Apparently, the shear strain that the
center bump experienced was sufﬁciently strong to produce the
laminar pattern. There was  difference, however, in the angle of tilt
of the laminar pattern. The laminar pattern for the central bump
after 2000 cycles, shown in Fig. 3(n), was more or less horizon-
tal, but the laminar patters for the left and the right corner bumps,
shown in Fig. 3(m)  and (o), exhibited tilt approximately in the −45◦

microstructure. Fig. 5(d)–(i) shows the microstructural evolution
during in situ TCT after 100 and 500 cycles for bump 1, 18, and 36,
respectively. The micrographs in each column represent the same
solder joint after different numbers of cycles. During TCT, clear dif-
ferences developed between bumps 1, 18, and 36. The center bump
(bump 18) developed a horizontal crack, as shown in Fig. 5(e) and
(h). In contrast, bump 1 developed a diagonal crack from the upper-
right to the lower-left corner, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and (g). In bump
36, a diagonal crack from the upper-left to the lower-right corner
can be seen, as shown in Fig. 5(f) and (i). The different directions
of the cracks were merely a reﬂection/expression of the direction
of the thermomechanical stress. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the central
bumps experienced stress only in the y direction, but the corner
bumps experienced stress in both the x and y directions.
These cracks were clearly due to thermomechanical stress dur-
ing TCT and were primarily propagated along the boundaries
between the Sn-rich and Pb-rich phase. One could also observe that
a small amount of solder was extruded from the surface. In actual
solder joints, in which the joints are covered by underﬁll, such pro-
trusion would not occur, as these protrusions were artifacts caused
by the free surface created for in situ observation. As 37Pb63Sn is
a relatively soft material and cracks was rarely reported in litera-
ture during TCT test, the observation of cracks here suggests that
the thermomechanical stress was indeed very large in electronic
packages used in this study.
It should be pointed out that during regular TCT observation, no
cracks at all were observed, even after 2000 cycles. Cracks devel-
oped during in situ TCT observation at a much earlier stage because
the joints were not protected by underﬁll on the top surface. In
addition, these in situ joints had been cross-sectioned by one half;
therefore, there was only half as much material in each joint to
absorb the stress energy.
4. Summary
The effect of thermomechanical stress on ﬂip-chip 37Pb63Sn
solder joints was studied. The thermomechanical stress trans-
formed the microstructure from a ﬁne eutectic to a coarse laminar
pattern. The shear strain on the corners joints, which experienced
the maximum thermomechanical stress among all the solder joints
in a ﬂip-chip package, was estimated to be 0.13 for each cycle. The
direction of the laminar pattern was  parallel to the direction of the
shear stress. It is argued that the laminar pattern had developed
in such a manner that the material with the lowest yield stress
(the Pb-rich phase) could align itself with the direction of the shear
stress. Because a continuous soft layer was  arranged in a direction
parallel to that of the shear stress, the stored deformation energy
could be dissipated more efﬁciently. It should be pointed out that
this proposition concerns only with why  the alloy arrived at such a
microstructure Nevertheless, no mechanism was  clear at this stage
concerning how did this occur. The detailed mechanism for this
microstructural evolution remains unknown. Additional purposely
designed experiments are needed to uncover the responsible mech-
anism for this highly interesting microstructure.

bonding, the Al–Cu IMC at the bond interface is too thin and too
small to be observed using optical microscopy or conventional
SEM. This leads to a claim that there is no Al–Cu IMC formation
right after wire bonding [19,21,25,26]. More detailed analysis
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), focused ion beam
(FIB), micro-X-ray diffraction (mXRD), and ﬁeld-emission scan-
ning electron microscopy (FESEM), however, did reveal the pres-
ence of Al–Cu IMC as bonded [22,30,31,33]. Nevertheless, the
presence of IMC at the bond interface can be clearly observed
after HTST (e.g., [32,34]). The hindering of Al movement in Cu
is generally attributed to the 10.5% atomic misﬁt between Cu
and Al. Moreover, the electronegativity of Au, Cu, and Al are
2.54, 1.9, and 1.61 eV, respectively, which also explains the lower
chemical activity of Al–Cu IMCs compared to Al–Au.
The main objective of this work is to investigate the growth
behavior of Al–Cu IMCs and void-induced damage at the Al–Cu
bond interface after HTST by experiments together with a theoret-
ical approach. To avoid possible damaging from the grinding
process, all specimens were polished with the Ar ion beam cross-
section polisher (CP) in vacuum. Inspections were carried out using
FESEM. A possible cause of damage of Cu wire bonding under HTST
due to imbalanced Al exhaustion is then proposed from the
inspections.
2. Experimental inspections
Fig. 1 shows FESEM images of the Al–Cu(Pd) interface after
HTST at 350 C for 24 h. The temperature was chosen such that
according to the Al–Cu binary phase diagram, the types of stable
IMCs do not change at temperature from 350 C downward to
room temperature. As a result, 350 C is about the highest temper-
ature that the interfacial reactions can be accelerated without
changing the behaviors of IMC formation. The entire Al layer had
been consumed except near the edge of the wire bonding. Only
the most Cu-rich IMC of the Al–Cu system, Al4Cu9, was observed
in Fig. 1. The results shown in Fig. 1 represent the limiting case
in which the reaction has gone to its completion in that the entire
Al layer has been consumed and only the most Cu-rich compound
remains.
There were a series of voids between Al4Cu9 and Cu. Along the
outer edge of the bond wire, some large voids can be seen within
the highly deformed Cu wire. These voids formed during the bond-
ing process due to the excessive plastic deformation of the origi-
nally round FAB. Following Drozdov et al. [31,32], there are two
types of voids at the interface in heat-treated specimens, namely,
voids formed during the wire bonding process and voids that
evolve during heat treatments. The former was relatively large,
continuous, and located at the bond periphery while the latter
was found to be the source of bond damage, featured by the dis-
continuous distribution at both periphery and center of the bond.
The voids that evolve during heat treatments can also be seen in
Fig. 2. As indicated by Fig. 2, in which voids near the Cu side at
the bond interface are clearly visible, formation of cavities between
Cu and IMC layer during thermal aging appears to be a major con-
cern. Hang et al. [30] reported that the as-bonded joint was free
from voids but cracks linked up to become a complete fracture
after HTST at 250 C for 81 h, for which voids evolved by volume
reduction accompanying IMC phase transformation. Nevertheless,
the underlying mechanism is yet to be identiﬁed. It should be
noted that, however, in this study no evidence is found relating
failure to those voids that evolve during heat treatments.
Fig. 3 shows FESEM images of the Cu–Al bond interfaces of our
test device after HTST at 150 C for 1500 h. The Al2Cu and Al–Cu
IMCs are present in the damaged unit while Al2Cu and Al4Cu9 IMCs
appear to be there in the good unit. It is also interesting to see that
the Al layer was exhausted in the damaged unit. It should be noted
that no void is observed in the failed unit, suggesting that there is
no direct connection between failure and the voids described
earlier.

potentials [47,49] and the exchange–correlation energy presented
by Perdew et al. [50] were adopted in this work. The cut-off energy
was 400 eV for the expansion of the electronic wavefunctions in
plane waves. Using the conjugate gradient relaxation algorithm,
the equilibrium lattice parameters were obtained from full relaxa-
tion of lattice vectors as well as the internal coordinate until the
Hellman–Feynman forces were less than 1 meV/Å. Static electronic
relaxations were carried out to ensure the energy tolerance re-
mained within 105 eV.
Calculated equilibrium lattice parameters and formation ener-
gies of Al2Cu, Al4Cu9, and AlCu are summarized in Table 1. Results
suggest that AlCu and Al4Cu9 are energetically more favorable than
Al2Cu, which is consistent with the observed IMC forming se-
quence from Al2Cu to AlCu or Al4Cu9 [38,39]. The formation energy
of AlCu is compatible with but slightly lower than that of Al4Cu9,
indicating that AlCu tends to be the most stable phase among the
three IMC species. In short, the formation energy calculation sug-
gests that Al2Cu will be the ﬁrst phase to form, and subsequently
either Al4Cu9 or AlCu will have about the same tendency to form
as the formation energies for these two phases are very similar.
As shown in Fig. 3, Al2Cu and AlCu are present in the damaged unit
that features Al exhaustion, and Al2Cu and Al4Cu9 are present in
the good unit with some Al remained. The reason why the Al layer
is completely consumed in one case and some Al layer remains in
the other case can be understood by the fact that the formation of
AlCu requires more than twice the amount of Al than the formation
of Al4Cu9 for the same amount of Cu consumed. The complete con-
sumption of Al is proposed as the reason responsible for the failure
of the damaged unit.
4. Summary
In this study, we examine the Al–Cu bonded interface. After
thermal aging at 350 C for 24 h, only Al4Cu9 was observed. The
formation of cavity or voids between the copper and the IMC layer
during thermal aging is observed. However, no direct link can be
established between these voids and failure. Results from storage
at 150 C for 1500 h indicated that there are Al2Cu and AlCu in
the damaged unit. On the other hand, Al2Cu and Al4Cu9 appear in
the good unit; the Al layer exhausted in the damaged unit, while
those with Al4Cu9 on the Cu side pass HTST. The reason why the
Al layer is completely consumed in one case and some Al layer re-
mains in the other case is because, for the same amount of Cu con-
sumed, the formation of AlCu requires more than twice the amount
of Al than Al4Cu9. Based on the study, the exhaustion of Al layer is
closely related to the function and reliability of the units.

The massive spalling of Cu3Sn in the soldering reaction between high-Pb solders and
Cu substrates was studied to identify the mechanism behind this rather interesting
and frequently observed phenomenon. Four different alloys (99.5 Pb 0.5 Sn, 99 Pb 1S n,
97 Pb 3 Sn, and 95 Pb 5 Sn, in wt%) were soldered at 350 C for durations ranging
from 10 s to 600 min. At low Sn concentration (0.5 or 1 Sn), massive spalling occurred
as early as 20 min. However, at high Sn concentration (3 or 5 Sn), massive spalling
was not completed even after 600 min. To the best of our knowledge, these results
are the most detailed observations ever reported on the sequence of events that occur
during massive spalling. The Pb–Sn–Cu phase diagram is used to rationalize the
phenomenon.
I. INTRODUCTION
Solder alloys play an important role in electronic
packaging; in particular, PbSn alloys are very frequently
used for flip-chip applications.1 During the soldering
reaction, one or more intermetallic compounds are
formed at the substrate–solder interface, and the integ-
rity of these intermetallics has a profound effect on the
reliability of the produced electronic devices. Recently,
considerable attention has been paid to the massive spall-
ing of intermetallics, that is, large-scale detachment of
intermetallics from the interface during soldering or
aging. Spalling has been observed in several substrate–
solder systems, for example, PbSn soldered on Ni,2
SnCu on Ni,3 SnAgCu on Ni,4,5 SnZn on Cu,6 and PbSn
aged on Cu.7 A unified thermodynamic rationalization
was subsequently proposed to explain the driving force
behind the massive spalling in these systems.8 Accord-
ing to this argument, if the most reactive constituent in
the solder is present in a limited amount and if its con-
centration decreases below a certain level during the
reaction, the original reaction product formed at the in-
terface is no longer in local thermodynamic equilibrium
with the solder. The original reaction product as a result
detaches itself from the interface and spalling occurs.
Because the amount of the most reactive constituent
has a marked influence on massive spalling, it is desir-
able to quantitatively analyze the effect of reactive ele-
ment concentration on massive spalling. In high-Pb
solders, Sn is the reactive constituent, and the objective
of this study is to understand the effect of Sn concen-
tration on the massive spalling during the high-Pb/Cu
soldering reaction.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Rectangular Cu substrate plates of dimension 25 
10  4 mm were mirror-polished on both faces, etched
with 50% nitric acid to remove the surface oxide layer,
and fluxed with a commercial mildly activated rosin flux
in preparation for the soldering reaction. PbxSn solder
alloys with four different Sn concentrations (x = 0.5,
1, 3, and 5 wt%) were prepared by first melting the pure
elements in an evacuated quartz tube and then placing it
in a furnace at 300 C for 1 wk for alloy homogeniza-
tion. Elemental Sn and Pb with purity >99.99 wt% were
used for alloy preparation.
Each solder bath was formed by placing 12 g of solder
into a quartz tube of 10-mm inside diameter. Each fluxed
Cu substrate was immersed in the fresh solder bath at
350 C. The reaction time ranged from 10 s to 600 min.
After the reaction, the tube along with the solder was
immediately quenched in water. Samples for cross-sec-
tional examination were prepared by two techniques:
(i) conventional metallographic grinding and polishing
and (ii) ion-milling cross-sectional polishing (E-3500;
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The ion-milling polishing has
the benefit of less sample damage but is more time
consuming. The ion-milling polishing also does not re-
quire surface etching by any chemical reagents. The
compositions of the phases were determined by a state-
of-the-art field-emission electron probe micro-analyzer
(FE-EPMA; JXA-8500F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).

to speculate that, for the lower Sn content cases (0.5 and
1 wt% Sn), (Pb) might also be unobservable if the reaction
time was <10 s. Another interesting observation was that
high Sn concentration was able to retard or delay the oc-
currence of the massive spalling. For 5 wt% Sn, massive
spalling did not occur even after 600 min of reaction, as
shown in Fig. 3(e). It should be emphasized that reaction
time >5 min is rarely used in industry. The purpose of
using these exceeding long reaction durations in this study
is to provide more observations for uncovering the under-
lying mechanism. These observations are also helpful in
establishing the safe outer limits before inducing any voids
near the interface.
IV. DISCUSSION
During the soldering reaction, the Sn atoms in solder
reacted with Cu to form Cu3Sn at the interface. If the
amount of solder had been small, as in flip-chip solder
joints, the Sn concentration in solder would have
decreased as Cu3Sn grew thicker. Nevertheless, in this
study, the amount of solder was purposely set to be
large (12 g) compared to the amount of Cu3Sn formed at
the interface. Consequently, the Sn concentration in solder
stayed nearly constant. It was estimated that, at the most,
<0.1 wt% of the Sn atoms in solder was consumed.
There is no experimental Pb–Sn–Cu isotherm at temper-
atures close to that of this study. However, Zeng and
Kivilahti9 calculated the Pb–Sn–Cu isotherm at 350 C
using the CALPHAD approach. This isotherm is redrawn
in Fig. 4 and will be used in the following discussion.
Although the kinetics of spalling is different for dif-
ferent Sn concentrations, with a slower kinetics for
higher Sn concentrations, the sequence of events during
spalling did seem to be the same in the entire Sn concen-
tration range used in this study. Accordingly, in the
discussion here, it is assumed that the spalling follows
the sequence of events summarized below. When the
solder came into contact with Cu, a layer of Cu3Sn
quickly formed at the interface, producing the solder/
Cu3Sn/(Cu) materials sequence [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)].
Here the notation (Cu) is used to represent the fcc
Cu phase (pure Cu or Cu–Sn solid solution phase). The
corresponding diffusion path is shown in Fig. 4(a). As the
reaction time increased, a (Cu) + (Pb) two-phase region
appeared between Cu3Sn and Cu, producing the solder/
Cu3Sn/(Pb) + (Cu)/(Cu) materials sequence [see Figs. 1(c)
and 1(d) or 3(e)]. The corresponding diffusion path is
shown in Fig. 4(b). As the reaction time increased further,
a continuous (Pb) layer appeared, producing the solder/
Cu3Sn/(Pb)/(Pb) + (Cu)/(Cu) materials sequence [see
Figs. 1(e) or 2(b)]. The corresponding diffusion path is
shown in Fig. 4(c).
Starting from the materials sequence solder/Cu3Sn/
(Cu), let us analyze the driving force for the formation
of (Pb) regions between Cu3Sn and (Cu). At the early
stage, because Cu3Sn was in direct contact with the Cu
substrate, which was pure Cu initially, Sn in Cu3Sn
would diffuse into the Cu substrate, turning pure Cu into
the Cu–Sn solid solution (Cu). Nevertheless, for the en-
tire concentration range of (Cu), only point A in Fig. 4(a)
can be in equilibrium with Cu3Sn. The rest of (Cu) pre-
fers to be in equilibrium with (Pb), as reflected by the
(Cu) + (Pb) two-phase field in Fig. 4. Accordingly, if the
Sn concentration in (Cu) had not reached point A yet,
(Cu) was not in local thermodynamic equilibrium with
Cu3Sn. Two things could happen to bring the interface
back to local thermodynamic equilibrium: (i) dissolving
more Sn into (Cu) so that its concentration became point
A or (ii) forming (Pb) phase next to (Cu). Because the
diffusion of Sn in Cu was a slow process, the formation
of (Pb) might actually be a faster route to bring the inter-
face into local thermodynamic equilibrium. This was in
fact what had happened, as was observed in this study.
