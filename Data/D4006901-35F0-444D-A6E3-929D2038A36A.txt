1. Introduction 
Hydrophobic membranes have been widely used in several membrane separation 
processes, such as membrane filtration, membrane extraction, and membrane distillation [1]. 
A recent research trend is to further enhance the membrane surface hydrophobicity to the 
so-called superhydrophobic level (water contact angle higher than 150o) [2, 3]. It was reported 
that the efficiency of membrane distillation could be improved by using a membrane with 
superhydrophobic surface [2]. It is also expected that the non-sticky characteristic of a 
superhydrophobic surface can help to alleviate biofouling [4], which would make the 
membrane wastewater-treatment processes more technologically and economically viable. 
The hydrophobicity of a surface is controlled by its chemical nature and morphology [5]. 
With suitable chemical nature and morphology, a surface can trap air on it, when being in 
contact with water, to enhance its hydrophobicity [6]. Such effect is usually characterized by 
the Cassie-Baxter model [7]: 
air
a ff θθθ cos)1(coscos −+=                      (1), 
where aθ  is the apparent surface contact angle, f denotes the solid fraction of the solid on 
the surface, and θ  and airθ  represent the water contact angles of the solid and the trapped 
air, respectively. Since airθ  is close to 180o, eqn. (1) can be rewritten as:  
1)cos1(cos −+= θθ fa                      (2). 
According to the above equation, the apparent surface contact angle increases with increasing 
surface porosity f−1 , because more air is trapped on the surface. 
Nature has developed an efficient way to trap air on the surface of some plants’ leaves, to 
enhance the surface hydrophobicity and make water rolling on the leaves: forming a surface 
hierarchical structure as shown in Fig. 1b [8]. Inspired by such natural phenomena, 
researchers have developed various techniques to construct the hierarchical structure on 
material surface. One can refer to several recent review papers [5, 9, 10] for the overview of 
the techniques generating hierarchical structure on material surface. Basically the techniques 
are categorized into the top-down and bottom-up approaches [5]. The top-down approaches 
encompass lithographic and template-based techniques, and plasma treatment of the surface. 
The bottom-up approaches involve phase separation, self-assembly and self-organization 
techniques. A combination of the bottom-up and top-down approaches has also been 
employed [11]. Among the techniques, phase separation is now still the most economically 
competitive method. Thermally induced phase separation [12] and vapor induced phase 
separation [13, 14] have both been used to prepare superhyrophobic surface.   
The present joint project was mainly proposed to develop a method to prepare 
membranes with superhydrophobic surface by using the phase separation method, which is 
probably the simplest and cheapest method to generate porous surface structure. The 
mechanism underlying the method was also investigated. In addition, applications of the 
 4
Shown in Fig. 1 are the SEM’s of the surface morphology of the PVDF membranes 
prepared by immersing a PVDF/NMP solution in water and in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 
that prepared by exposing the solution to humid air. The results demonstrate that the two 
approaches discussed above made the surface of the PVDF membrane more porous. The 
water contact angles for the surfaces of the three membranes shown in Fig.1 were 70o, 122o, 
and 125o, respectively. The results indicate that we were able to enhance the hydrophobicity 
of membrane surface by making it more porous; but with the approaches discussed above, the 
membrane surface was not yet superhydrophobic.

Introducing heirarchical structure by polymer crystallization 
As indicated in the work of Zhao et al. [3], one can prepare a superhydrophobic surface 
by allowing polymer to crystallize during VIPS. Following the work, we prepared 
polycarbonate (PC) membranes with superhydrophobic surface by using VIPS. The surface 
structure of the membranes is presented in Fig. 2 and the water contact angle of the surface 
was measured to be 151o when the relative humidity of the environment was controlled at 
90%. The hierarchical structure of the membranes can be seen clearly from Fig. 2(b). And 
evidence was obtained showing that the forming the structure was strongly related to the 
crystallization of polymer.  
Figure 2 shows that the structure of the polycarbonate membranes was nodular, which is 
believed to be formed by the crystallization of polymer during VIPS. However, with similar 
procedures and conditions, the prepared PVDF membranes were bicontinuous, as shown in 
Fig. 1c. We found the reason for the formation of the bicontinuous structure was because 
PVDF gelled before crystallization occurred. And the competition between gelation and 
crystallization could be adjusted by changing the dissolution temperature as the PVDF/NMP 
solution was prepared. Such results have been published in Journal of Membrane Science [15]. 
When the dissolution temperature was 32oC, the membrane structure obtained was 
bicontinuous (Fig. 1c). When the dissolution temperature was raised to 60oC, PVDF

separation before polymer crystallization. Preparation of membranes with the wet inversion 
process would make the exchange of solvent and coagulant faster, which would liquid-liquid 
phase separation to the casting solution before it crystallized. However, with the 
wet-inversion method, the surface of the prepared membranes was dense (Fig. 1a) when water 
was the coagulant and was bicontinous (Fig. 1b) when ethanol was the coagulant. Both of the 
membranes were not superhydrophbic.  
A major contribution of our work is to find that membranes containing connected 
nodules can be prepared by using the wet inversion process, if the coagulant is IPA and a 
suitable dissolution temperature is adopted to prepare the PVDF/NMP solution. When the 
dissolution temperature was 32oC, the membrane structure obtained was bicontinuous (Fig. 
1b). When the dissolution temperature was raised to 60oC, PVDF membranes with connected 
nodules were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4. The water contact angle of the membrane surface 
was about 148o. And the mechanical strength of the membranes is high enough for 
applications as microfiltration and membrane distillation. 
When the PVDF/NMP solution was immersed in a coagulation bath of IPA, liquid-liquid 
phase separation occurred before polymer crystallization. After the phase separation, the 
polymer-rich phase could crystallize and the crystallization continued until the polymer-rich 
phase gelled. In other words, it depended on the competition between crystallization and 
gelation of the polymer-rich phase if the hierarchical structure formed. With a dissolution 
temperature of 32oC, the polymer-rich phase gelled before crystallization occurred, inhibiting 
the formation of hierarchical structure. When the dissolution temperature raised to 60oC, the 
polymer-rich phase could crystallize before it gelled, resulting in the structure shown in Fig. 4 
and the superhydrophobicity of the membrane surface. However, polycarbonate membranes 
with hierarchical structure cannot be prepared by using the wet inversion process. For 
polycarbonate, it seemed that the polymer-rich phase formed after phase separation always 
gelled before it could crystallize.

dead-end microfiltration experiments were conducted to separate bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
from yeast suspensions. With the same filtration and cleaning procedures, the PVDF 
membranes prepared in the present work showed higher flux and lower degree of flux decline, 
comparing to commercial track-etched polycarbonate membranes, polyethersulfone 
membranes, and Teflon membranes. In addition, we observed that the hierarchical structure of 
the prepared PVDF membranes mitigated the adsorption of fibrinogen.  
 
Membrane distillation (MD) 
Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was performed to remove salt from a 
30000 ppm NaCl aqueous solution. One side of the membrane was in contact with the saline 
solution and the other side with pure water. Temperature difference across the membrane was 
carefully maintained to provide a driving force for water to vaporize from the saline solution, 
transport through the pores, and condense on the liquid at the other side. The membranes used 
required a high hydrophobicity to retain air inside the pores. The results showed that the salt 
rejection was higher than 99.8% for all the PVDF membranes we prepared, and their 
permeation fluxes were all higher than the commercial Millipore PVDF membranes. For one 
case, the permeation flux was two times of that of the commercial Millipore PVDF 
membranes. The results are presented in Fig. 6.

present work and the commercial membranes (Millipore 0.2μm, thickness=200μm,

Microfiltration 
The performance of the superhydrophobic PVDF (s-PVDF) membranes prepared in the 
present work was examined for the application to the separation of cells and proteins. Four 
kinds of membranes, the PVDF membranes we prepared and three commercial microfiltration 
membranes, polyethersulfone (PES), polycarbonate (PC) and Teflon (PTFE) membranes, 
were employed for separation of BSA from yeast suspension mixture. The top and 
cross-sectional SEM images of the selected membranes are shown in Figure 7. In addition, the 
characteristic properties of the membranes used in this study are presented in Table 1. Note

Anti-Biofouling 
Experiments of fibrinogen adsorption were performed to study how the structure of 
PVDF membranes affected their protein adsorption. We measured the amount of fibrinogen 
adsorption on six PVDF membranes, with different morphologies and water contact angles. 
Shown in Fig. 10 are the morphologies of the membranes and the corresponding water contact 
angles.  
 
 
Fig. 10 Morphologies and water contact angles of the PVDF membranes used for the 
experiments of fibrinogen adsorption 
 
ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunoassay) was used to measure the amount of fibrinogen 
adsorption on the PVDF membranes. The results are shown in Fig. 11, where the amount of 
protein adsorption is expressed in terms of relative adsorption. We used the adsorption 
amount of fibrinogen on a polystyrene membrane as a reference. The relative adsorption for a 
PVDF membrane is defined as the ratio of the amount of adsorbed protein on that membrane 
to that on the polystyrene membrane. The results show that the hierarchical structure of the 
prepared PVDF membranes mitigated the adsorption of fibrinogen. However, the mitigation 
cannot be observed if the membranes were pre-treated with ultrasound or 
ultrasound+immersion in alcohol. The observations indicate that the trapped air in the 
hierarchical structure played a role in protein adsorption; when the air was removed by the 
pretreatment, the effect of the hierarchical structure cannot be observed.

deposition time was long enough. The surface morphologies of the deposited surface were 
examined by using SEM and the results are shown in Fig. 14. We also deposited HMDSO on 
a PET substrate under the same experimental conditions. The results show that with a 
deposition time of six minutes a deposited PET surface having a water contact angle of 157o 
was obtained.

A tool to examine how the substrate structure affects the PECVD deposited layer 
With PECVD of HMDSO monomers, a SiOCH deposited layer formed on the surface of 
the substrate. To investigate how the substrate structure affects the fine structure of the 
SiOCH deposited layer, we developed a technique that combines Doppler broadening energy 
spectroscopy (DBES) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The PALS was 
conducted with the slow positron beam at the R&D Center for Membrane Technology, Chung 
Yuan University, Taiwan. The schematic presentation of the set-up is shown in Figure 15.

Figure 16 shows the SEM surface morphology and cross-section of the substrates used 
in this study. MCE-0025 and PAN substrates displayed surfaces with a lot of nanopores, 
whereas MCE-022 and PTFE-02 showed surfaces with porous structures.  
Doppler broadening of energy spectra (DBES), one of the positron annihilation 
techniques, was used in this study. This technique is a powerful method for determining the 
chemical composition and physical microstructural change in materials. Fig. 17 shows the S 
parameter as a function of the positron incident energy (S-E plot) data for four 
SiOCH/substrate composite membranes. Three major regions for the SiOCH/PAN composite 
membrane can be identified ⎯(1) near the surface and the bulk of the SiOCH layer (region I), 
(2) the transition layer (mixed layers of SiOCH and substrate, region II), and (3) the polymer 
substrate (region III). 
To clearly understand the variation in the S parameter in each layer, a computer 
program VEPFIT was used to deconvolute the S parameter in each SiOCH/substrate 
composite membrane layer. The best fitted results as judged from good χ2 values are plotted in 
Fig. 18. Based on Fig. 18, the SiOCH deposited on MCE-0025 with a surface porosity of 
13.4% had the lowest S values among the SiOCH films, indicating that such SiOCH had the 
smallest microporosity or pore size.

The present investigation revealed how the morphology and crystalline forms of a poly(vinylidene ﬂu-
oride) (PVDF) membrane, prepared by using the vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) method, were
affected by the temperature atwhich PVDFwas dissolved to form the casting solution. The results showed
that there existed an important transition dissolution temperature, being referred to as the “critical dis-
solution temperature”, across which the morphology and crystalline forms of membranes drastically
changed. With a dissolution temperature above the critical dissolution temperature, the prepared mem-
branes were composed of nodules and the size of nodules decreased as the dissolution temperature
decreased. And, with a dissolution temperature below the critical, membranes with lacy (bi-continuous)
structure were obtained. In addition, the -crystalline form of PVDF grew faster than the -form when
the dissolution temperature was below the critical, and the -form became faster and dominant as
the dissolution temperature increased to be above the critical. The existence of the critical dissolution
temperature was observed for all the three solvents used in the present study, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), andN,M-dimethylformamide (DMF), indicating that the phenomena
are general and not limited to a speciﬁc solvent. Also, it was observed that the two PVDF/NMP solutions,
preparedwith dissolution temperatures above and below the critical temperature, responded in different
ways when water was added into the solutions. Though both solutions gelled, the solution with higher
dissolution temperature started the gelation with a crystallization-initiation gelling process, while the
other with a non-crystallization-initiation gelling. We propose that the competition between the two
gelling processes play an important role in determining the PVDF membrane morphology and crystalline
polymorphs, and the dissolution temperature can change the competition. And the critical dissolution
temperature can be interpreted as a dissolution temperature across which the dominant gelling process
switched.

1. Introduction
Because of their good chemical and thermal stabilities [1],
poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF) membranes have been widely
used in a broad range of applications [2–7]. To prepare PVDF mem-
branes for the application of ultra-ﬁltration, the wet-inversion
(immersion precipitation) method, direct immersion of a PVDF
cast ﬁlm in a nonsolvent bath, is usually employed [2,5]. However,
for applications that require membranes with larger surface pores

than ultra-ﬁltration does, such as microﬁltration and membrane
distillation, other membrane preparation techniques are needed.
Vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) is an efﬁcient method to
bring about highly porous PVDF membranes with pore size on the
range of micron and sub-micron [8,9].
VIPS uses vapor (usually water vapor) as the nonsolvent phase
to bring the composition of a cast ﬁlm into the phase separation
region and to generate porous structures in the ﬁlm [2]. When
a low-volatility solvent is employed to prepare the cast ﬁlm, the
evaporation of solvent is slower than the intake of nonsolvent,
resulting in a region with low polymer concentration near the ﬁlm
surface [10]. The lower polymer concentration near the ﬁlm surface
explains why VIPS is efﬁcient to prepare membranes with highly
porous surface. Another feature of VIPS, compared with the wet-
inversion method, is that the nonsolvent is taken into the cast ﬁlm

2.5. Characterization of the crystalline forms of membranes
The  and  crystalline forms contained in the PVDF mem-
branes were characterized by their infrared absorption peaks. The
-form,with alternating trans and gauche (TGTG′) chain conforma-
tion, can be characterised by the absorption peak at 763 cm−1; the
-form, with all trans (TTTT) conformation, can be characterized
by the absorption peak at 840 cm−1 [22]. FTIR-ATR (PerkinElmer,
LE 186-0078) was used to obtain the IR spectra of the prepared
PVDF membranes. According to the procedures reported in the lit-
erature [23–25], we can estimate the fraction of a crystalline form
in a crystal with the knowledge of the absorbance of the character-
istic peaks of all crystalline forms and their absorption coefﬁcients.
With the absorbance at 763 cm−1 (A) and 840 cm−1 (A) and the
absorption coefﬁcients of the -form (K =6.1×104 cm2/mol) and
the -form (K =7.7×104 cm2/mol), the mass fraction of the -
form in the crystal can be calculated (assuming that the densities
of the  and  crystallites are the same):
F˛ = A(K/K)A + A
Since andwere the major crystalline forms contained in the
PVDF membranes, F can be interpreted as the mass fraction of the
 crystalline form in the PVDF crystals contained in the membrane.
2.6. Characterization of membrane crystallinity by DSC
The crystallinity of PVDF membranes was measured by using a
DSC (Perkin-Elmer DSC-7C). All measurements were performed at
a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min under a constant ﬂow of nitrogen gas.
The crystallinity was evaluated based on the crystallization heat of
ideal PVDF crystals (H
◦
f
= 105 J/g) [26].
2.7. Falling-ball experiments
Falling-ball experiments were conducted to study the gelation
behavior of the PVDF solution after water was added into it. A steel
ball, with a weight of 2 (±0.05) g and 0.8 cm in diameter, was put
into a glass tube thatwas ﬁlledwith the PVDF/NMP/water solution.
The solution was maintained at 25 ◦C for days to allow of gela-
tion. The time needed for the ball to fall 15 cm in the solution was
recorded each day. The measured ball-falling time was normalized
by the initial ball-falling time, taken immediately after the solu-
tion was prepared. The normalized ball-falling time, denoted by tf,
increased as the solution gelled. A larger tf indicates a higher degree
of gelation.
2.8. Measurement of ﬂuid viscoelasticity
Dynamic rheological experiments were performed with a DV-
III cone-and-plate rheometer (Brookﬁeld). All experiments were

measured at a ﬁxed angular frequency of 100 rad/s.
2.9. Characterization of ordered chain formations formed in PVDF
solution
PVDF solution was placed in a liquid holder composed of two
CaF2 plates and a Teﬂon spacer. The holder was mounted to a
FTIR (Perkin-Elmer, Spectrum 1). The IR spectrum of the solution
was then obtained. It was examined if the solution contained TT
(trans–trans) or TGTG′ (alternating trans and gauche) chain confor-
mation. In Section 2.5, the absorptions at 763 cm−1 and 840 cm−1
were used to characterize the TT and TGTG′ conformations inmem-
branes. However, the signal at these two wavelengths was blocked
by the CaF2 plates and thus cannot be used to detect the chain con-
formations contained in the solution. Under this circumstance, the
absorption peaks at 1174 cm−1 and 1232 cm−1 were used to char-
acterize TT conformation, and those at 1182 cm−1 and 1206 cm−1
for TGTG′ conformation.
3. Results
3.1. Typical morphology of the PVDF membranes prepared by
VIPS
Fig. 1a and b shows the structure of the PVDF membranes pre-
pared by directly immersing a PVDF/NMP solution (20wt%) in a
water bath (25 ◦C). A typical asymmetric membrane was obtained,
containing dense skin at the surface (Fig. 1a) and macrovoids at
the cross-section (Fig. 1b). If the same solution was exposed to
humid air (25 ◦C and 70% relative humidity) for 20min before being
immersed in thewater bath, the obtainedmembrane structure dra-
matically changed, as indicated in Fig. 1c and d. Themembranewas
composed of uniform polymer nodules.
Note that the exposure time of the polymer solution to humid
air was an important factor in determining the membrane struc-
ture. If the period was not long enough, the membrane structure
could have still being affected by the phase separation in the water
bath. The obtained structurewould then bemore like that obtained
by the wet-inversion method. In order to prevent the membrane
structure from being complicated by the phase separation in the
water coagulation bath, in the present work the exposure time was
always set long enough that the membrane structure was mainly
driven by the phase separation induced by water vapor.
3.2. Effect of PVDF dissolution temperature on membrane
morphology
Shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are the morphologies of the PVDF mem-
branes fabricated with the casting solutions that were prepared at
different Td, ranging from 32 ◦C to 150 ◦C. Though Td was different
in each case, before ﬁlm casting all the solutions were cooled to
25 ◦C and maintained at it for 3h. The results show a strong depen-
dence of the PVDFmembranemorphology on Td. PVDFmembranes
composed of polymer nodules were obtained with Td >40 ◦C. Fig. 2
shows that, by lowering Td, the nodule size decreased and the con-
nectivity among the nodules was higher. When Td was 32 ◦C, the
membrane structure became lacy (bi-continuous): bothmembrane
pores were inter-connected and so were the polymer domains, as
illustrated in Fig. 3.
The dependence of the connectivity of polymer domains on Td
indicates an inﬂuence of Td on the membrane mechanical strength.
The PVDF membranes without much connectivity among the nod-
ules possessed poor mechanical property. With Td higher than

DMAc and PVDF. The deduction is supported by the solubility of
PVDF in the three solvents at 25 ◦C, also listed in Table 2. The results
in Fig. 6 show that a poorer solvent had higher Tmin and Tcri, which
was expected since higher temperature was needed for the poorer
solvent to dissolve the same amount of PVDF. For the three sol-
vents, the gaps between Tmin and Tcri were larger as the polymer
concentration was higher. Namely, with higher polymer concen-
tration it was easier to ﬁnd conditions to prepare membranes with
inter-connected polymer domains.
Fig. 6 provides a good reference for selecting appropriate
solution-preparationconditions to fabricatePVDFmembraneswith
VIPS. By selecting Td in between Tmin and Tcri, one can obtain highly
porous membranes with enough mechanical strength for practical
applications.
3.6. Characterization of the properties and stabilities of
PVDF/NMP solutions
It should be noted that it took time to completely dissolve
PVDF in solvent to make homogeneously clear solution. If the
dissolution time was not long enough, we obtained suspension,
instead of transparent solution. The required dissolution time
depended on Td. Longer dissolution time was needed with lower
Td. The time needed was 8h to prepare a homogeneously clear
20wt% PVDF/NMP solution with Td =60 ◦C. But, it took 7 days to
get a transparent solution with Td =32 ◦C. We carefully conﬁrmed
that they were transparent all the PVDF solutions used to prepare
membranes.
The stability of the 20wt% PVDF/NMP solutions was investi-
gated. The solution crystallization temperature is believed to be
higher than 25 ◦C, as the solutions, prepared with Td =32 ◦C and

detected in the solution.
the water amount increased to 2wt%, we began to observe an
increase in tf after about 6 days. With Td =32 ◦C, the addition of
1 or 2wt% of water caused an increase in tf in one day. More water
added caused faster increase in tf. The results reveal that addition of
water in the PVDF/NMP solution induced the solution to gel. With
more water, gelation was initiated earlier. And the gelation behav-
ior was strongly affected by Td: faster gelation was observed in the
solution prepared with lower Td.
We also investigated by using FTIR if ordered conformations of
polymer chains formed during the gelation. The results are shown
in Fig. 10. For the PVDF/NMP solution prepared with Td =60 ◦C, we
detected the occurrence of an ordered conformation about 13 days
after the addition of 1wt% of water and about 6 days with 2wt% of
water. For the solution with Td =32 ◦C, the time needed to identify
an ordered conformation was shorter, 7 days with the addition of
1wt%ofwater and2dayswith2wt%ofwater. The results showthat
the addition of water also induced ordered chain conformations in
the solution. And the ordered conformations formed more quickly
in the solution prepared with lower Td.
We marked in Fig. 9 the times that the ordered conformations
were detected in the solutions. For the solution prepared with
Td =60 ◦C, the solution started to gel after the occurrence of an
ordered conformation. However, for the solution with Td =32 ◦C,
the ordered conformation was detected after tf had increased to
a certain degree, indicating that the solution had already gelled
to a certain degree when the ordered conformation was detected.
The results suggest that the PVDF/NMP solution prepared with
Td =60 ◦C responded to the addition of water in a different way
from the solution with Td =32 ◦C. On one hand, for the solution
with higher Td, polymer chains formed an ordered conforma-
tion, which then lead to the formation of a gel. On the other
hand, for the solution with lower Td, though an ordered chain
conformation was still observed, it occurred after gelation had
developed to an extent. In other words, though both solutions
gelled after the addition ofwater, they started the gelationwith dif-
ferent mechanisms. The different mechanisms actually resulted in
gels with different mechanical properties. Highly elastic gels were
obtainedwithTd =32 ◦C;but, thegels obtainedwerepaste-likewith
Td =60 ◦C.
Also, the ordered conformations were different in the two
solutions. With Td =60 ◦C, the ordered conformation detected was
TT (trans-trans). With Td =32 ◦C and 2wt% of water, the confor-
mation was TGTG′. With Td =32 ◦C and 1wt% of water, though
both TT and TGTG′ were detected, TT only formed in the initial
period, after which the formation of TGTG′ became dominated;
TT started to occur at the 7th day, but it stopped forming imme-
diately after TGTG′ started to form at the 10th day. The results
demonstrate that, in response to the addition ofwater, the polymer
chain inclined to form a TT conformation in the solution prepared
with Td =60 ◦C, while TGTG′ was the preferred conformation with
Td =32 ◦C.
The results presented in this section show that Td inﬂuenced
dramatically how the solution responded to the addition of water
into it. Though the solutions preparedwith Td =32 ◦Cand60 ◦Cboth
gelled after the addition of water, the two solutions started gela-
tion with different mechanisms, favored different ordered chain
conformations, and resulted in gels with different mechanical
properties.
3.8. Gelation and crystallization of PVDF/NMP cast ﬁlms in
response to the intake of water vapor from humid air
Experiments were carried out to show how Td inﬂuenced the
crystallization of the PVDF/NMP cast ﬁlm when it was exposed to
humid air. We measured the degrees of crystallinity of the mem-
branes prepared with various exposure times to humid air. The
results are shown in Fig. 11. With longer exposure time to humid
air, the cast ﬁlm stayed longer in the crystallization region before
it underwent liquid–liquid demixing; therefore, the membrane
crystallinity increased with increasing exposure time. The results
shown in Fig. 11 manifest that the cast ﬁlm prepared with lower Td
crystallized faster when it was exposed to humid air.
It was also investigated how Td inﬂuenced the gelation of the
cast ﬁlm when it was exposed to humid air. To test if a cast ﬁlm
gelled after imbibing water vapor, we examined whether or not
macrovoids formed in it after theﬁlmwas immersed inwater. Itwas
reported [28] that the growth of macrovoids in a water bath would
be inhibited after the cast ﬁlm gelled. For the PVDF/NMP solution
prepared with Td =32 ◦C, the macrovoids disappeared after the cast
ﬁlm was exposed to humid air for 10min (Fig. 12a). With the same
exposure time,macrovoids still existed if the solutionwasprepared
with Td =60 ◦C (Fig. 12b). The results support that the PVDF solution
preparedwith lower Td gelled faster afterwaterwas imbibed to the
solution.
Besides, we studied if there was a preferred polymorph during
the formation of a PVDF membrane by VIPS. PVDF crystals grew as
the cast ﬁlm was exposed to humid air (Fig. 11). During the growth

why crystalline nodules were the dominant structure in the mem-
branes prepared with Td =60 ◦C. The preference of  crystalline
form in this case could be well explained by taking into account
the effect of solvent polarity. For solvent crystallization of PVDF, it
has been reported that -form would be favorable over  when a
polar solvent was used [29], because  is a polar form while  is

were used to understand the inﬂuence of the chemical conforma-
tion on the pore structure. In addition, the relation between the
pore structure and the gas separation performance was discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) (AlfaAesar®, purity >98
vol.%) was used without further puriﬁcation as the organosilicon
precursor. The substrates used were an MCE membrane with a
diameter of 0.025m, which was supplied by Millipore, and a sili-
con wafer (for FTIR analysis). The resulting composite membranes
were characterized by conducting a gas permeability test and an
FTIR analysis.
2.2. Preparation of composite membrane
The plasma deposition was conducted in a custom-built vac-
uum chamber, which was described in our previous study [12].
OMCTS was volatilized in a heating jacket at 40 ◦C and delivered
to the plasma reactor by a powered showerhead assembly through
a vapormass ﬂow controller (MKS type 1150). OMCTSwas then fed
into the reactor at a constant ﬂow rate of 5 standard cubic centime-
ters per min (sccm) without any carrier gas. The system pressure
was controlledat0.2 Torrbyanauto-pressure control (APC) system.
As the system pressure reached stability, the plasmawas turned on
and the plasma power was varied from 20 to 150W.
2.3. Characterization
Various analyticalmethodswere used to characterize the chem-
ical and physical properties of the plasma-polymerized SiOCH
ﬁlms. The morphologies of the SiOCH/MCE membranes were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi Model
S4700). The thickness of the SiOCH ﬁlms was determined from
the SEM images. A common method for calculating the deposi-
tion rate is to divide the SiOCH thickness by the deposition time.
The chemical structure of the plasma-polymerized SiOCH ﬁlms
was evaluated based on FT-IR (Perkin–Elmer, Model SPECTRU-
MONE) analyses.Measurementswere done from450 to 4000 cm−1.
Absorption bands were deconvoluted by means of full Gaussian
proﬁles with the use of the Peak Fitting Module of OriginPro v7.0
(OriginLab) software.
2.4. Slow-positron beam technique
Doppler broadening energy spectroscopy (DBES) and positron
annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) coupled to the slow
positron beamat the R&DCenter forMembrane Technology, Chung
Yuan University, Taiwan were used for characterizing the pore
structure of the SiOCH ﬁlms as a function of the depth. The mean
penetration proﬁle was calculated by using an established equa-
tion [13], which is given below, for a positron incident energy of
0–30keV; the measured mean depth in the polymeric membranes
was usually between 0 and about 10m.
Z¯ = 40
(
E1.6

)
(1)
where Z¯ represents the mean penetration depth,  is the mass
density of the sample (g/cm3), and E is the positron beam energy
(keV).
22Nawith 50mCiwas used as the positron source. The PALS sys-
tem used the secondary electrons emitted from the sample surface
as the start signal and the gamma ray induced by the positronium
annihilation in the free-volume as the stop signal. The PALS data
were measured using a BaF2 lifetime detector at a counting rate
of approximately 200–300 cps. Each PALS spectrum contained 2.0
million counts. The DBES spectra were measured using an HP Ge
detector at a counting rate of approximately 2000 cps. The total
number of counts for each DBES spectrum was 1.0 million. The
S parameter from the DBES represents the relative value of the
free-volume in the depth proﬁle for polymeric systems.
All collected data on PALS were ﬁtted by the PATFIT program
[14]. The analyzed results of the o-Ps lifetime (3 or 4) from
the PATFIT program are on the order of 1–5ns for typical poly-
meric materials. The so-called pick-off annihilation with electrons
of molecules was used to calculate the mean free-volume radius R
(Å to nm) based on an established semi-empirical equation, which
is based on a spherical-cavity model [15,16], as follows:
3 =
1
2
[
1 − R
R0
+ 1
2
sin
(
2R
R0
)]
(2)
where 3 is the o-Ps lifetime (ns), R is the free-volume radius (Å),
and R0 =R+R, where R is the electron layer thickness, semi-
empirically determined to be 1.66 A˚. Detailed descriptions of the
slow positron beam and data analysis can be found elsewhere
[17,18].
2.5. Gas separation performance
The details of the apparatus (Yanaco Gas Permeability Ana-
lyzer,modelGTR-10)used for the gaspermeabilitymeasurement at
isothermal conditions at 35 ◦C (±0.5 ◦C) were given in our previous
study [19]. The gas permeability was calculated with the following
equation:
P = 1
p1 − p2
[
q/t
A
]
× 106 (3)
where Pdenotes the gas permeability (cm3(STP)/cm2 s cmHg),with
units in GPU (GPU=1×10−6 cm3(STP)/cm2 s cm), q/t is the gas vol-
umetric ﬂow rate (cm3(STP)/s), pl and p2 are the pressures (cmHg)
on the high and low pressure sides of the membrane, respectively,
and A is the effective membrane area (cm2)).

Actually, it is difﬁcult to prepare a high SiO2-like structure without
the addition of oxygen in the system [20]. Thus, we cannot see an
increase in the T-group clearly with the RF power increasing. With
the RF power increasing, the OMCTS precursor would dissociate
into smaller fragments and produce more reactive sites. One can
expect that Si–O reactive species have more opportunity to react
with hydrocarbon and then increase the M-group intensity.
3.3. Gas separation performance
The O2/N2 and CO2/N2 gas separation performance of
SiOCH/MCE compositemembranes is shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen
that the O2 and CO2 permeability decreasedwith an increase in the
applied power, but their selectivity relative toN2 showed the oppo-
site trend. This behavior indicates that the plasma-polymerized
SiOCH ﬁlms fabricated at a higher RF power had a higher crosslink-
ing structure than at a lowerpower. TheCO2 permeability showeda
higherpermeability in comparisonwithO2 becauseCO2 has a lower
kinetic diameter and has a strong interaction with SiOCH ﬁlms [4].
Comparedwith other plasma-polymerized SiOCHﬁlms, all plasma-
polymerized membranes of Si-containing series showed high O2
and CO2 permeabilities but a low O2/N2 selectivity. For example,
in Roualdes et al. study [1], plasma-polymerized octamethyl-
trisiloxane ﬁlms show an O2 permeability between 1.5×10−8 and
11×10−8 (cmcm3(STP) cm−2 s−1 cmHg−1) and an O2/N2 selectiv-
ity from0.91 to 1.7. For plasma-polymerizedhexamethyldisiloxane
ﬁlms on a substrate of cellulose acetate in Li et al. study [5],
they also show a higher O2 permeability of about 2.2×10−7

3.4. Analysis of ﬁne structure of plasma-polymerized SiOCH ﬁlms
DBES coupled to the slow positron beam was used in this study
to investigate the ﬁne structure of plasma-polymerized SiOCH
ﬁlms. Fig. 10 shows the S parameter as a function of the positron
energydata (S–Eplot) for SiOCH/MCEcompositemembranes; three
layers were identiﬁed in Fig. 10. For comparison, neglecting the
thickness effect, SiOCH ﬁlms with the same thicknesses could be
obtained at different RF power by adjusting the deposition time.
All SiOCHﬁlms thicknesseswere controlled at about 240nm,which
was determined based from the SEM images. As described in our
previous study [11], the SiOCH/MCE composite membranes con-
sist of three layers, deduced as a result of the DBES analysis: (1)
bulk of the plasma-polymerized SiOCH layer (region I), (2) transi-
tion region (a mixed layer of SiOCH ﬁlms and MCE, region II), and
(3) MCE substrate (region III).
In region I, the S parameter initially shows a lower value due to
the back diffusion of positron and positronium because a polymer-
like SiOCH ﬁlm contains a lot of sub-nanometer defects near the
surface [21,22]. Therefore, as the positron penetrates deeper in the

plasma-polymerized SiOCH layer, a large fraction of the positron-
ium (Ps) can be trapped in the holes and then annihilated, resulting
in a sharp increase in the S parameter with the mean depth in the
near surface region. When the positron penetrates further into the
bulk of the plasma-polymerized SiOCH, the S parameter displays
an approximately constant value in region I. It is evident that the S
parameter value in the bulk layer of the SiOCHﬁlms decreasedwith
an increase in the RF power (0.5541 at 50W, 0.5469 at 100W, and
0.5283 at 150W), which means that the SiOCH structure at 150W
has a smaller free-volume (high packing density).
As the positron keeps penetrating into the transition region
(region II), which corresponds to the initial stage during the plasma
polymerization, the values of the S parameter slightly increased to
0.5571 at 50W, to 0.5503 at 100W, and to 0.5343 at 150W. The
major reason may be due to the fragmentation of MCE, produced
at the initial stage of the plasma deposition process (serious etch-
ing effect). The fragments then mixed with SiOCH from OMCTS,
resulting in a loose packing (increase in the S value) [11]. When the
positron energy is higher than 5keV, it reaches the MCE polymeric
substrate and the value of the S parameter displays a decreasing
tendency because the chemical composition of the MCE polymer
contains positron acceptors such as carbonyl groups, which can
trap positrons and inhibit the formation of positronium, result-
ing in a decrease in the S parameter [17,23,24]. Fig. 11 shows an
R–E plot (3/2 ratio). Since the R parameter represents the rel-
ative amount of 3 annihilation in large pores or vacuum, it can
reﬂect the amount of pore size over 1nm. We observed a larger R
value near the surface because of the back diffusion of positron-
ium, and the R value decreased with an increase in the RF power
in the bulk layer of the SiOCH ﬁlm, which means that the SiOCH
structure shows a loose packing at a lower RF power. This result is
in agreement with that of the S–E plot in Fig. 10.
To discuss the pore size change quantitatively, we conducted
PALS experiments at a positron incident energy of 2 keV, which is
within the SiOCHbulk layer. The analyzed 3, I3 and 4, I4 are shown
in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively, where 3 and 4 represent free-
volume sizes, whereas I3 and I4 indicate relative concentrations
of a speciﬁc free-volume size. As shown in Fig. 12, 3 decreased
with increasing RF power, whereas I3 only had a little change
with power. This result is consistent with the S parameter anal-
ysis, indicating the SiOCH ﬁlms densiﬁcation with increasing RF
power and a decrease in the S parameter mainly due to variation
in 3 (free-volume size) rather than in I3 (concentration of free-
volume). The densiﬁcation of SiOCH ﬁlms would lead to a decrease

hole properties on an atomic scale. The variable energy positron
beamwith an adjustable energy and a narrow energy distribution
allows depth-resolved measurements that are useful in plasma-
polymerized film fine structure studies. Such method has the
characteristic of accurately probing the free-volume variation
from the topmost layer (∼0.1 nm) of the surface down to the bulk
layers (several micrometers).11-14 In our previous study,15 the
SiOCH films deposited on an MCE substrate consisted of two
layers (bulk and interfacial layers), which were probed using the
slow positron beam technique; the interfacial layer showed larger
pore sizes than the bulk layer because of the etching and rede-
position on the MCE substrate in the early deposition stage.
In this study, the slow positron beam was used to discuss the
effect of the substrate type on the fine structure of a plasma-
polymerized SiOCH layer as a function of depth. Also, the rela-
tionship between the gas separation performance and the pore
structure was discussed.
Experimental Methods
Materials. Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), supplied by
Aldrich, was used without further purification as the precursor.
To discuss the effect of different substrates on the structure of
plasma-polymerized SiOCH films, four substrates with different
morphologies were chosen: mixed cellulose esters (MCE-0025,
MCE-022), polyacrylnitrile (PAN), and polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE-02). Their chemical structures and other details are given
inTable 1. To facilitate the description of each type of substrate, a
simple nameplate consisting of alphabets and numbers was used
in this study. The alphabets represent the type of the polymer and
the numbers refer to the pore size. For example, MCE-0025
denotes that the substrate is a mixed cellulose esters polymer with
a mean pore size of 0.025 μm.
PECVD Process. SiOCH films were polymerized on different
polymeric substrates by plasma deposition at 13.56 MHz using a
homemade capacitively coupled parallel-plate reactor, the descrip-
tion of which was given in our previous study.16 The experimental
procedure for preparing the composite membranes was as follows:
first, the reactorwas evacuated to 0.023Torr; second, theHMDSO
vapor was fed into a reactor without any carrier gas through a
vapor mass flow controller (MKS type 1150) at a constant flow
rate of 20 sccm; and third, as the system pressure was adjusted to
0.2 Torr, the RF power was turned on and set at 200 W. In this
process, the deposition time was the major operating parameter
that caused an adjustment in the thickness of the SiOCH film.
Doppler Broadening Energy Spectrum (DBES). A newly
built slowpositron beamwith a variablemono energy at theR&D
Center for Membrane Technology,17,18 Chung Yuan University,
Taiwanwas used for this study to determine themeandepth of the
membrane between 0 and ∼10 μm. (The mean depth was calcu-
lated by using an established equation19 based on the positron
incident energy from 0 to 30 keV.) This new radioisotope beam
uses 50 mCi of 22Na as the positron source. The DBES spectra
were measured using an HP Ge detector at a counting rate of
∼2000 cps. The total number of counts for each DBES spectrum
was 2.0million. The obtainedDBES spectrawere characterized in
terms of the S,W, andR parameters. The S parameter, represent-
ing the low momentum part of the positron-electron annihilation
radiation, is sensitive to the change of the positron and positro-
nium (Ps) states due to microstructural changes.10,14 Because
the positron and Ps are trapped in a hole with a finite size, the
observed S parameter is a measure of the momentum broadening
according to the uncertainty principle: a larger hole results in a
largerS parameter value. Two other parameters fromDBESwere
also reported here: (1) W parameter, which represents the high
momentum part in the DBES spectra. It is an indication of the
types of the chemical elements or defect types in the DBES data.
(2) R parameter, which is defined as the 3γ to 2γ annihilation
ratio, can provide information about the existence of large pores
(nanometers to micrometers). It is from o-Ps undergoing 3γ
annihilation, whereasS andW are from p-Ps and o-Ps undergoing
2γ radiation (pick-off annihilation) in free volumes (angstroms to
nanometers). Therefore, the pore is larger, and the opportunity
for the 3γ annihilation to take place increases, resulting in a higher
R parameter. Amore detailed description of these parameters can
be found in the literature.9,14
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the SEM surfacemorphology and cross-section
of the substrates used in this study. MCE-0025 and PAN sub-
strates displayed surfaces with a lot of nanopores, whereasMCE-
022 and PTFE-02 showed surfaces with porous structures. The
latter substrates had different surface pore structures: MCE-022
surface was of the nodular-type structure and PTFE-02 surface
had many nodes connected to each other by fiber-like filaments.
Although themanufacturer provided some information about the
substrates, it only referred to bulk properties such as mean pore
size. It was necessary, therefore, to analyze the surface properties

fragments directly contacted the solid part of the substrate, the
fragments would deposit and form SiOCH films. Therefore, the
morphology of the plasma-polymerized SiOCH films could be
seen to follow the substrate morphology (or surface porosity-
related characteristics). For example, as the SiOCH deposited on
PTFE-02 with a fiber-like structure, it would preferentially de-
posit on the solid part such as nodes and fibers, and the result-
ing surface would then show a morphology similar to that of
PTFE-02. The deposition rate of the SiOCH films decreased with
an increase in the mean pore size in the substrate (Table 2). It
appears that the morphology of the plasma-polymerized SiOCH
films is associated with the substrate surface porosity-related
characteristics, such as the size/shape of pores. On the basis of
the SiOCH structure difference, which is mainly due to the sub-
strate morphology, we can expect that these composite mem-
branes will have different gas-separation properties.
Gas-Separation Performance. SiOCH films were deposited
on all substrates under the same plasma conditions of 200 W for
60 min, and the resulting composite membrane was used for the
measurement of O2 and N2 gas permeabilities. The data on the

the S parameter in each SiOCH/substrate composite membrane
layer. The best fitted results as judged from good χ2 values are
tabulated in Table 4 and plotted in Figure 4. On the basis of
Figure 4, the SiOCH deposited on MCE-0025 with a surface
porosity of 13.4% had the lowest S values among the SiOCH
films, indicating that such SiOCH had the smallest microporosity
or pore size. Therefore, this composite membrane showed a lower
O2 permeability and the highest O2/N2 selectivity, consistent with
the observation of the S values for the SiOCH films. Compared
with the SiOCH films deposited on MCE-0025, those on porous
substrates (MCE-022 and PTFE-02) had thicker transition layer
and thinner bulk layer at a higher S parameter, which means that
themicrostructure of the SiOCH films was affected layer by layer.
A higher surface porosity of the substrates induced thicker
transition layer with a highermicroporosity, resulting in a thinner
bulk layer with a higher microporosity in the process of plasma
polymerization. The SiOCH films deposited on MCE-022 with a
nodular surface showed the highest S value in the transition layer,
indicating that these SiOCH films had the highest microporosity.
On the basis of Figure 2b, it appears that the SiOCH films with a
pillar structure (Figure 2) had toohighof a porosity or pore size to
improve theO2/N2 selectivity.Comparedwith SiOCH/MCE-022,
the SiOCH films deposited on the PTFE-02 substrate with a
fibrous surface showed lower S values in the transition layer and
the SiOCH bulk layer. We infer that a slow deposition rate
induced a high packing density and that a fiber-like morphology
suppressed the formation of a pillar structure, and these results
were reflected on a lower S parameter in the transition layer.
Therefore, the SiOCH/PTFE-02 composite membrane showed a
high PO2 and an O2/N2 selectivity of 1.9. For the SiOCH/PAN
membrane, a fast SiOCHdeposition rate of 53.7 (nm/min) led to a
loose packing and a SiOCH film having a thicker transition layer
with a higherS value in comparisonwith the SiOCHonPTFE-02,
even when PAN had a lower surface porosity of 15%. Thicker
SiOCH films with a thickness of 3.22 μm caused a lower PO2,
whereas those with higher microporosity (higher S parameter)
reduced the O2/N2 selectivity. From a comparison of Tables 3
and 4, it can be deduced that the O2/N2 selectivity was inversely
proportional to the S parameter for the SiOCH film bulk layer.
Figure 5 shows plots of the R parameter as a function of the
positron incident energy for four SiOCH/substrates composite
membranes.A highR value can be observed at the surface because
of back diffusion because R represents the relative amount of
3γ annihilation from large pores (>1 nm) or vacuum.14,23 In

An SiOxCyHz/mixed cellulose ester (MCE) composite membrane was fabricated by plasma deposition of
hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) monomer on the surface of an MCE substrate. The purpose is to apply
the membrane for the oxygen enrichment of an O2/N2 mixture. The variation in the ﬁne structure of
the plasma-polymerized layers (SiOxCyHz) prepared at different plasma conditions was identiﬁed using
slow-positron beams. Although the SiOxCyHz layers displayed similar FTIR spectra, they evidently showed
differences based on the data from Doppler broadening energy spectroscopy (DBES) and positron anni-
hilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). These data indicated distinct differences in the physical structure
despite the similarities in the chemical structure of the ﬁlms. The deposited layer (mixture of HMDSO
species and MCE species) had more hydrocarbon group, resulting in a looser structure of the deposited
layer at the initial period of plasma deposition. However, the MCE species content of the deposited layer
decreased with the deposition time, and the deposited layer became denser. From PALS, the o-Ps life-
time (3, corresponding to the free-volume size) decreased along the plasma deposition layer growth
direction. These results corresponded with those obtained from XPS very well. The plasma-deposited
membrane was applied for O2/N2 separation. The O2 permeability decreased and the concentration of O2
in the permeate increased with the deposition time and as the plasma power increased.

1. Introduction
In gas separation, the membrane thickness is considered as a
major factor that affects gas permeation. Generally, the gas per-
meability decreases with an increase in the membrane thickness,
whereas the selectivity shows the reverse tendency. In view of this,
the fabrication of thin ﬁlms with high cross-linking structures has
been regarded as a solution for enhancing gas permeability and
simultaneously retaining high selectivity [1,2]. Plasma polymeriza-
tion has been known as one of the apparent methods for preparing
this membrane, as plasma-polymerized membranes usually pos-
sess the properties of ultra-thin, highly cross-linked, pinhole-free,
and good adhesion substrates [3,4]. Furthermore, compared to
other processes for synthesizing thin layers at high tempera-
tures, plasma polymerization usually operates at low temperatures
(70–150 ◦C) on the substrate side, which can avoid any damage on
the polymeric substrate [5].

In plasma polymerization, various plasma parameters can
affect the deposition mechanism and result in several types of
plasma-polymerized ﬁlm structures [6]. Supported ﬁlms for gas
separation are generally thin (few microns or less), which make
them hard to characterize by conventional techniques. To date,
there are only few researches that discuss the effect of the depth
proﬁle for the structure of plasma-polymerized ﬁlms used for
gas separation [7,8]. In recent years, positron annihilation spec-
troscopy (PAS), including Doppler broadening energy spectroscopy
(DBES) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS),
has been developed as a useful tool in probing the microscopic
structure of polymeric materials [9–13]. One of the great advan-
tages in PAS characterization is the direct determination of the
polymer free volume and hole properties at an atomic scale.
With this method, a variable energy positron beam with an
adjustable energy and a narrow energy distribution allows depth-
resolved measurements useful in plasma-polymerized ﬁlm ﬁne
structure studies. The method possesses the characteristic of accu-
rately probing the free-volume variation from the topmost layer
(∼0.1 nm) of the surface down to the bulk layers (several m)
[10–13].

200 W-20 min.
In this paper, three SiOxCyHz/MCE composite membranes were
fabricated at different plasma conditions, the SEM pictures of which
are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) shows that there are many micro-scale
pores on the surface of the MCE substrate. After plasma deposi-
tion, the pinhole-free dense SiOxCyHz layer uniformly covered the
MCE substrate. As shown in Fig. 2(b)–(d), the plasma-polymerized
SiOxCyHz layers have the same thicknesses (each has a thickness of
about 1180 nm).
In addition to using SEM pictures, FTIR-ATR spectra (Fig. 3)
were used to further characterize the three plasma-polymerized
SiOxCyHz layers obtained at different plasma conditions. Based from
these spectra, the bonded groups present in the SiOxCyHz layers
were identiﬁed. The band assignments include O–H stretching band
(3000–3800 cm−1), –CH stretching band (2900–3000 cm−1), Si–H
stretching band (∼2125 cm−1), C O stretching band (1740 cm−1),
–CHx=2, 3 bending band (1300–1480 cm−1), the stronger Si–O–Si
stretching band (1020–1070 cm−1), and –CH rocking band
(750–890 cm−1); the–OH, C O and Si–H bonds are absent in the
structure of the HMDSO monomer [17,18]. All of the SiOxCyHz layers
displayed similar FTIR spectra.
During plasma polymerization, the deposition rate observed
in the beginning could reﬂect the macroscopic mechanism of the
deposition and the degree of monomer molecular fragmentation.
As shown in Fig. 4, the deposition rate increased with the applied
plasma power, a ﬁnding similar to previous works [3,19,20]. At
higher applied power, the decomposition of the monomer occurred
at a faster rate than at lower applied power; the polymerization
rate was enhanced due to the increase in the concentration of the
reactive fragments and radicals. The impact of the plasma condi-
tions on the change in the ﬁne structure of the plasma-polymerized
SiOxCyHz layers as a function of depth from the surface and on the
gas separation performance, neglecting the effect of the thickness,
was discussed in the following section.

for each plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz/MCE composite membrane
can be identiﬁed–(1) near the surface and the bulk of plasma-
polymerized SiOxCyHz layer (region I), (2) the interfacial region
(SiOxCyHz + fragmentation of HMDSO, region II), and (3) the MCE
substrate (region III). The S–E plot at the plasma condition of
100 W-60 min displays a larger value of the S parameter compared
with that at 200 W-20 min, meaning that the SiOxCyHz structure
at 100 W-60 min has a larger free volume (low density). In region
I, the S parameter initially shows a lower value due to the back
diffusion of the positron. Therefore, as the positron penetrates
deeper in the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz layer, a large fraction
of the positronium (Ps) can be trapped in the holes. This positro-
nium was then annihilated, resulting in a sharp increase in the S
parameter with the mean depth. When the positron penetrates
further into the bulk of the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz (from
1.2 to 3.5 keV), the S parameter displays an approximately con-
stant value of 0.538 ± 0.001 at 100 W-60 min and 0.533 ± 0.001
at 200 W-20 min. These values are similar to those published in
other literatures [21]. The S parameter value at 200 W-20 min indi-
cates that the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz layer has a smaller
free volume (high density). As the positron keeps penetrating into
the interfacial region (SiOxCyHz + fragmentation of MCE, region II),
which corresponds to the initial stage during plasma polymeriza-
tion (3.5–7 keV), the values of the S parameter slightly increased
to 0.540 ± 0.001 at 100 W-60 min and to 0.534 ± 0.001 at 200 W-
20 min. The major reason may be due to the fragmentation of MCE,
produced at the initial stage of the plasma deposition process (seri-
ous etching effect). The fragments then mixed with SiOxCyHz from
HMDSO, resulting in a decrease in the deposition layer density
(increase in the S value). When the positron energy is higher than
8 keV, it reached the MCE polymer and the value of the S parameter
displays a decreasing tendency because the chemical composi-
tion of the MCE polymer contains some positron acceptors such as
carbonyl groups, which can trap the positrons and inhibit the for-
mation of positronium, resulting in a decrease in the S parameter
[9,22,23].
To identify the composition of the bonds in the plasma-
polymerized SiOxCyHz layers, electron spectroscopy for chemical
analysis (ESCA) was used. Table 1 shows the relative bond
assignments of C1s and Si2p X-ray photoelectron spectra of the
plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz layers. For each SiOxCyHz layer, the
C1s spectra can be generally deconvoluted into C–C, C–O, C O, and
C–Si contributions with binding energies of 284.6, 286.5, 288, and
283.5 eV, respectively. The deconvolution of Si2p peak yields bind-
ing groups of Si–C4 (at 99.5 eV), SiOC3 (at 100.8 eV), SiO2C2 (at
101.9 eV), SiO3C (at 102.8 eV), and SiO4 (at 103.6 eV) [3].
The ratio of C/Si in the SiOxCyHz layer (Fig. 7) can be calculated
from the measurement of the C1s and Si2p core-level peak areas.
Here, the variation in the ratio of C/Si in the SiOxCyHz layer indi-
rectly represents the structural differences because the existence of
carbon groups, as many literatures have found [24–26], can intro-
duce nano-pores in the SiOxCyHz layer. As a result, the C/Si ratio
decreased with an increase in the applied power, indicating smaller
free volume (fewer hydrocarbons) in the SiOxCyHz layer fabricated
at a higher plasma power. Thus, all of the S values of the plasma-
polymerized SiOxCyHz layers prepared at high plasma power
(200 W-20 min) are lower than those of the plasma-polymerized
SiOxCyHz layers prepared at low plasma power (100 W-60 min).
Apart from the S parameter, there is the W value, which is a param-
eter calculated from the high-momentum regions of annihilation
radiations of 511 keV. The W parameter is sensitive to the chem-
ical surrounding of the annihilation site in materials. Therefore,
the S–W plot can exhibit the variation in the free volume and the
annihilation characteristics in plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz/MCE
composite membranes at different plasma conditions.
In Fig. 8(a) and (b), the S–W plots show two straight lines with
different slopes, indicating two distinct characteristics of positron
annihilation in the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz layer and the
MCE substrate. It means that the chemical or physical structure
of the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz layer is different from the
MCE polymer. Two lines intersecting at a speciﬁc S and W val-
ues indicate a signiﬁcant transition from the plasma-polymerized
SiOxCyHz layer to MCE. The value of (S, W) in the interfacial layer is
(0.540 ± 0.001, 0.136 ± 0.002) at 100 W-60 min and (0.534 ± 0.001,
0.140 ± 0.002) at 200 W-20 min. Based on the marks indicated in
Fig. 8, we can clearly observe the characteristics and position of each
layer in the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz/MCE composite mem-
brane (there are three layers—the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz

4. Conclusion
In this study, the variation in the ﬁne structure of the plasma-
polymerized layers (SiOxCyHz) with similar thicknesses prepared
at different plasma conditions was identiﬁed using slow-positron
beams. From PALS, the o-Ps lifetime (3, corresponding to the free-
volume size) decreased along the direction of the growth of the
plasma-deposited layer in the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz/MCE
composite membranes. The free-volume radius and the free-
volume amount in the plasma-polymerized SiOxCyHz layers were
found to decrease with an increase in the applied power, resulting
in low O2 permeability and high O2/N2 selectivity. The plasma-
polymerized SiOxCyHz layers at the initial stage of the plasma
polymerization possessed higher porosity due to the existence of a
higher content of hydrocarbon and a maximum free-volume radius
of about 3.916 ± 0.002 Å at 100 W-60 min and 3.866 ± 0.003 Å at
200 W-20 min.

子自組裝來控制膜面的 anti‐biofouling 物理結構，增強台灣在這方面的研究基
礎。
