1.45. For existing processes on safety, strength, or critical parameters, the capability 
must be no less than 1.45, and for new processes on safety, strength, or critical 
parameters, the capability must be no less than 1.60. Using the index IC , the 
practitioners can evaluate their process capability and make decisions.

In practice, no measurement is free from errors even if  the measurement is 
conducted using highly sophisticated advanced measuring instruments. Any 
variation in the measurement process has a direct impact on capability estimation 
and judgment about the true process capability. Clearly, conclusions about process 
capability based on the empirical index values are not reliable. To analyze the 
effects of  measurement errors on true process capability, Mittag [7] and Levinson [6] 
discussed the behavior of  theoretical process capability indices in the presence of  
measurement errors. Bordignon & Scagliarini [1] performed some statistical 
analysis in estimating PC  and PKC . 
In this paper, we consider the one-sided process capability indices PUC  and 
PLC . We first develop the relationship between the true process capability and the 
empirical process capability. We then show that the empirical confidence bound of  
capability estimation severely underestimates the true capability. When performing 
capability testing, both the α -risk and the power of  the test decrease substantially 
with presence of  measurement errors. To estimate the capability accurately and 
improve the power with given α -risk, adjusted confidence bounds and critical 
values are provided. An application example on TFT-LCD is also presented. 
2. Empirical Process Capability 
Suppose that X  ~ N( μ , 2σ ) is the relevant quality characteristic of  a 
manufacturing process, and M  ~ N(0, 2Mσ ) is a random variable describing the 
measurement errors. Assuming that X  and M  are mutually independent, 
instead of  measuring the true variable X , the empirical data Y ~ N( Yμ μ= , 
2 2 2
Y Mσ σ σ= + ) is observed and measured. The empirical process capability indices 
Y
PUC  and 
Y
PLC  are obtained after substituting Yσ  for σ . We first define the degree 
of  error contamination τ  (see Mittag [7]), 
Mστ σ= ,                             
to obtain the following relationship between the empirical process capability index

It represents that MSE ( )YIC  > MSE ( )IC  if  τ  > 0τ , MSE ( )YIC  < MSE ( )IC  if  τ  < 0τ  exclusive of  0, and MSE ( )YIC  = MSE ( )IC  if  τ  = 0τ  or 0.  
Table 3 lists the 0τ  values for n  = 5(5)100. Figures 1(a)-1(b) display the 
surface plots of  the ratios γ  = ( , , )If C n τ  with n  = 5(1)100 and τ  in [0, 1]

Similarly, a 100 θ % lower confidence bound IC  for PLC  satisfies 
( )PL LP C C θ≥ = . It can be shown as 1 2( ( 3 ) )n L LP t nC tδ θ− = ≤ = , where Z is 
distributed as N(0, 1) , 1t  = - 1k n , and 2t  = 2k n . To find the exact 100θ % 
lower confidence bounds, Pearn & Shu [15] provided an algorithm and a Matlab 
program to solve the above equations. With measurement errors, we use YIC  to 
estimate IC  but not IC . Thus, 1Yt = - 1(3 / )YPU nC b n−  and 2Yt = 1(3 / )YPL nC b n−  
instead of  1t  and 2t , are substituted into the equations to obtain the confidence 
bounds. Denote the bounds originated from 1

Yt  as YUC  and

presence of  measurement errors, and YUC  (or 
Y
LC ) is smaller than UC  (or LC ), 
it is necessary that Yθ  is always greater than θ . Severely underestimating the 
true process capability may result in high production cost, losing the power of

Earlier discussions indicate that we underestimate the true process capability 
using YIC  instead of  IC . The probability that YIC  is greater than 0c  would be 
less than that of  using IC . Thus, the α -risk using YIC  to estimate IC  is less 
than the α -risk if  using IC  to estimate IC . The power, if  using YIC  to 
estimate IC , is also less than the power using IC . That is, we have Yα  ≤  α  
and Yπ  ≤  π . Figures 3(a)-3(b) are the surface plots of  Yα  with n  = 5(1)100 
and τ  in [0, 1] for IC  = 1.00, 1.33 and α  = 0.05. Figures 4(a)-4(b) are the 
plots of  Yπ  versus τ  with n  = 50 and α  = 0.05 for c  = 1.00, 1.33 and IC  
= c (0.20) c +1. Note that for τ  = 0, Yα  = α  and Yπ  = π  in those figures.

developed to solve the equations. Figures 5(a)-5(b) are comparisons among UC , 
Y
UC , and UC
∗  for PUC  = 1.00, 1.33 with n  = 50, where UC  is the 95% lower 
confidence bound of  PUC , YUC  is the 95% lower confidence bound of  YPUC , and 
UC
∗  is the adjusted 95% lower confidence bound for YPUC . Note that in this case, 
the probability that the interval with the bound YUC  contains the actual PUC  
value is greater than that of  the interval with the bound UC  or UC
∗  does, while 
the probability that the interval with the bound UC  or UC
∗  contains the actual 
PUC  value is just 0.95. From Figures 5(a)-5(b), we see that the lower confidence 
bounds remained underestimated, even if  we adjust the formula to calculate the 
bounds. But, the magnitude of  underestimation using adjusted confidence 
bounds is significantly reduced.

In order to improve the power of  the test, we consider the revised critical 
values 0c

∗  < 0c . Thus, the probability that 
Y
IC  is greater than 0c∗  
is greater than the probability that YIC  is greater than 0c . Both the α -risk and 
the power increase when we use 0c
∗  as a new critical value in the testing. 
Suppose that the α -risk using the revised critical value 0c∗  is α∗ , the revised 
critical 0c

energy compared to a CRT (cathode-ray tube), is slimmer and weighs less. The 
TFT-LCD emerges as the most widely used display solution, because of  its high 
reliability, viewing quality and performance, compact size and environment- 
friendly features. Because of  the heat resistance, non-conductance, and simple 
processing steps. Non-alkali thin film glass is the major material of  manufacturing 
TFT-LCD. While manufacturing non-alkali thin film glass, flatness is one of  the 
critical quality characteristics. If  the flatness of  glass is not in control, the 
TFT-LCD products may result in a certain degree of  chromatic aberration.

    Consider a supplier in manufacturing TFT-LCD products in Taiwan, the 
production specifications of  flatness for a particular model of  non-alkali thin film 
glass are: USL  = 25 um (0.0025 mm), T  = 0 um. A total of  60 observations 
were collected which are displayed in Table 5. To determine whether the process 
is “Satisfactory” ( PUC  > 1.33) with unavoidable measurement errors τ  = 0.4, 
we propose the following procedure, STEP 1: Determine the capability 
requirement c  (normally chosen to 1.00, 1.33, 1.50) and the α -risk (normally 
set to 0.01, 0.025, or 0.05), STEP 2: Calculate the value of  the point estimator IC  
from the sample, STEP 3: Check the appropriate table listed in Tables 4(a)-4(d) 
and finding the corresponding critical value 0c
∗  based on α , τ , and n , STEP 4: 
Conclude that the process meets the capability requirement if  IC  is greater than 
0c
∗ . Otherwise, we do not have enough information to conclude that the process is 
capable.
