二、 英文摘要 
A gain factor adapted by both the 
intra-frame masking properties of the human 
auditory system and the inter-frame SNR 
variation is proposed to enhance a speech 
signal corrupted by additive noise. In this 
project we employ an averaging factor, 
varying with time-frequency, to improve the 
estimate of the a priori SNR. In turn, this SNR 
estimate is utilized to adapt a gain factor for 
speech enhancement. This gain factor reduces 
the spectral variation over successive frames, 
so the effect of musical residual noise is 
mitigated. In addition, the simultaneous 
masking property of the human ears is also 
employed to adapt the gain factor. 
Imperceptive residual noise with energy 
below the noise masking threshold is retained, 
resulting in a reduction of speech distortion. 
Experimental results show that the proposed 
scheme can efficiently reduce the effect of 
musical residual noise.  
Keywords: Speech enhancement; Perceptual; 
SNR variation; Spectral subtraction; Colored

一、 前言 
Voice quality in wired or wireless 
communication systems is important for 
human-to-human and human-to-machine 
interactions. Improving speech quality can 
reduce listener fatigue and can improve the 
recognition rate when a speaker is in a noisy 
environment. Many speech enhancement 
algorithms have been proposed to improve 
speech quality (Bahoura and Rouat, 2006; 
Boll, 1979; Cappé, 1994; Chen and Loizou, 
2007; Ephraim and Malah, 1984; Ghanbari 
and Karami-Mollaei, 2006; Gustafsson et al., 
1998; Hasan et al., 2004; Hu and Loizou,

a priori SNR (Cappé, 1994; Ephraim and 
Malah, 1984; Hasan et al., 2004; Hu and 
Loizou, 2004a; Suhadi and Fingscheidt; 2007), 
the proposed gain factor is not only adapted 
by the a priori SNR, but also adapted by the 
noise masking threshold (NMT). 
Experimental results show that the proposed 
approach outperforms the alternative Ephraim 
and Malah suppression rule (Wolfe and 
Godsill, 2001), a method adapted by the a 
priori SNR and the SNR variation of 
consecutive two frames (Hasan et al., 2004), 
and an adaptive thresholding method 
(Ghanbari, Karami-Mollaei, 2006) on wavelet 
coefficients for most of the tested conditions. 
 
1. Perceptual gain factor 
A noisy speech signal ) ,( nmy
 
can be 
modeled as the sum of clean speech ) ,( nms
 
and additive noise ) ,( nmd
 
in the frame m of 
the time domain, i.e.,  
) ,() ,() ,( nmdnmsnmy +=  (1) 
where m and n denote the frame and the time 
indices, respectively. 
The spectral estimate of speech signal 
)ω,(ˆ mS  is obtained by multiplying a gain 
factor )ω,(mg  with the noisy spectrum 
)ω,(mY  of a subband, i.e.,  
)ω,()ω,()ω,(ˆ mYmgmS ⋅=  (2) 
where ω  represents the frequency bin index. 
A spectral distortion measure ) ,( ωmE  is 
defined as the difference between the 
short-term spectra of clean speech ) ,( ωmS
 
and of enhanced speech ) ,( ˆ ωmS . This 
spectral distortion specifies the performance 
of a speech enhancement system, and is given 
by

respectively. 
  Assuming the noise signal is additive and 
is uncorrelated with a speech signal; the gain 
factor )ω,(mg  given in (2) can be optimized 
by minimizing the short-term spectral energy 
associated with the speech distortion, subject 
to a constraint on the short-term spectral 
energy related to residual noise below the 
noise masking threshold (NMT) (Hu and 
Loizou, 2004b; Lu and Wang, 2004a; 2004b): { }

where ω) ,(mT  is the NMT corresponding to 
the frequency bin ω . The NMTs are all 
identical in a critical band. 
  The NMT is estimated as follows: Initially, 
a frequency analysis of a critical band is 
performed, and a spreading function is 
convolved to consider the masking properties 
between different critical bands. Then the 
spectrum is subtracted by a relative threshold 
offset. Finally, the resulting spectrum is 
renormalized and compared with the absolute 
threshold of hearing to decide the NMT for 
each critical band. Detailed procedures were 
summarized by Schroeder (Schroeder et al., 
1979). 
  In order to derive the gain factor ω) ,(mg , 
a cost function )ω ,(mJ P  can be formulated in 
terms of the speech distortion and the residual 
noise (Hu and Loizou, 2004b; Lu and Wang,

Substituting (4) and (5) into (7), then to

decided by the a posteriori SNR and an 
instantaneous noise-overestimation constant. 
Experimental results show that speech 
distortion can be reduced during transitional 
speech segments and that residual noise can 
be reduced in speech absence by using this 
smoothing factor to estimate the a posteriori 
SNR. 
Observing the optimal smoothing factor 
) ,(* ωα m
 
given in (14), it is adapted by the 
priori SNRs of current frame ),( ωγ mprio
 
and 
the estimated a priori SNR of the previous 
frame ),1(ˆ ωγ −mprio . The relationship of which 
the optimal smoothing factor ) ,(* ωα m
 
varies with the priori SNRs of the current 
frame ( ),( ωγ mprio  denoted SNRcurr) and of the 
previous frame ( ),1(ˆ ωγ −mprio  denoted SNRprev) 
is demonstrated in Fig. 1.  
 
 
Fig. 1. Variation of the optimal smoothing 
factor (alpha) versus the priori SNRs of 
previous frame (SNRprev) and current frame 
(SNRcurr). 
 
In Fig. 1, the optimal smoothing factor 
approaches unity when the SNR variation is 
small over successive two frames, i.e., 
),1(ˆ),( ωγωγ −≈ mm prioprio . The increased value 
of the smoothing factor would not affect the 
accuracy of the SNR estimate. Owing to the 
slight variation of the SNR, the gain variation 
is also small. Thus, a random spectral peak of 
residual noise can be prevented in the 
enhanced signal. Conversely, the smoothing 
factor tends to a small value when the SNR of 
the previous frame is large and that of the 
current frame is small. This case may occur in 
the transition region of an offset signal which 
is at the end of a voiced sound. The small 
value of the smoothing factor renders the SNR 
estimate responsible for that of the offset 
signal. The SNR variation can change rapidly 
from high to low SNRs, so the echo effect is 
absent while this SNR estimate is applied to 
adapt a gain factor. If the SNR of previous 
frame is small, and that of current frame is 
large, this may be the onset of a speech signal. 
The smoothing factor corresponds to a 
medium value, increasing the smoothing 
effect for the SNR estimation between 
successive two frames. It results in a slowly 
change from low to high SNRs. Speech 
distortion increases slightly.  
 
B. Gain factor and SNR estimate  
  As the priori SNR ),( ωγ mprio  is unknown, 
an approximate value of ) ,(* ωα m  given in

In order to understand that the smoothed 
version of SNR is varied by the SNRs of the 
previous frame ),1(ˆ ωγ −mprio
 
and of the 
 7 
modified Bark spectral distortion (MBSD) 
(Yang et al., 1998) are conducted to evaluate 
the performance of the proposed speech 
enhancement system. Only the performance in 
the speech-activity regions is evaluated. An 
informal subjective measure based on 
mean-opinion score (MOS), and spectrogram 
comparisons are also conducted.  
 
A. Speech enhancement methods for 
comparison 
The Ephraim and Malah suppression rule 
(EMSR) is both optimal in the minimum 
mean-square error sense and well known for 
its associated colorless residual noise 
(Ephraim and Malah, 1984); however, it 
requires the computation of exponential and 
Bessel functions. Wolfe and Godsil (2001; 
2003) proposed using the same modeling 
assumptions as the EMSR, and derived an 
alternative Bayesian approach, which leads to 
suppression rules exhibiting almost identical 
behavior as the EMSR. In addition to 
permitting a more intuitive interpretation of 
the EMSR algorithm, an alternative EMSR 
provides a clear insight into the behavior of 
the EMSR algorithm. This alternative version 
of the EMSR is named as altEMSR hereafter. 
The altEMSR can be efficiently implemented,

Hasan et al. (2004) directed toward finding 
a self-adaptive averaging factor given in (14) 
to estimate the a priori SNR. As the 
time-frequency averaging factor is adapted by 
SNR variation, improved results are obtained 
in terms of speech quality measures for 
various types of noise corruption with 
different SNR levels. The gain factor is based 
on spectral subtraction (SS), given as (Sim et

speech enhancement methods. (a) 
Periodogram of noisy speech corrupted by 
F16-cockpit noise with SegSNR = 5 dB for a 
subband. Gain variations for the methods, (b) 
alternative EMSR, (c) Hasan, (d) proposed 
methods.  
 
An example of the gain variation contours 
for subband 8, which is arbitrarily selected, is 
shown in Fig. 3. In a speech-dominated region, 
the value of the gain factor tends towards 
unity for all methods as illustrated in Figs. 3(c) 
- 3(d). It is beneficial to obtain a lower speech 
distortion. In the case of a noise-dominated 
region, the Hasan (Fig. 3(c)) method achieves 
a lower gain factor than the altEMSR (Fig. 
3(b)) and the proposed (Fig. 3(d)) methods. 
The drawback of the altEMSR and the 
proposed methods is that these two methods 
retain more residual noise. Observing the gain 
contour of the proposed method shown in Fig. 
3(d), the higher values of gain factor occur at 
the weak-energy portions for noise-dominated 
regions, enabling the weak energy to be 
preserved. On the contrary, the lower values 
of gain factor are produced at the strong 
energy portions, enabling the background 
noise to be suppressed. Preserving the weak 
 9 
factor in the enhanced speech signals, 
enabling speech distortion to be reduced. The 
quality of enhanced speech is therefore 
maintained.

The minimal Avg_IS distance corresponds 
to the best speech quality. Table 2 presents the 
performance comparisons of Avg_IS distance. 
It can be found that the altEMSR method 
slightly outperforms the other methods in the 
cases of factory and of helicopter noise 
corruptions when the input SNR is equal to 10 
dB. In the other cases, the proposed method 
exhibits the lowest values of Avg_IS distance 
among the four methods. These results reveal 
that the proposed method offers better spectral 
envelopes than the other three methods. This 
is due to the proposed method employing an 
auditory masking property to adapt the gain 
factor, thus enabling a residual noise spectrum 
with magnitude under the NMT to be 
preserved. It brings the benefit of reducing the 
 11 
for each subband; enabling these methods not 
to over-attenuate the noisy speech signals. 
Since the minimum statistics algorithm 
(Martin, 2001) is not suitable for estimating 
the noise level for wavelet coefficients, an 
improved estimate of noise level is proposed 
by speech-pause detection for each subband 
(Ghanbari, Karami-Mollaei, 2006).

Mandarin by a female speaker. (from top to 
bottom) (a) clean speech, (b) noisy speech 
corrupted by babble noise with average 
SegSNR = 0 dB , (c) enhanced speech using 
alternative EMSR method, (d) enhanced 
speech using Hasan method, (e) enhanced 
speech using adaptive thresholding method, 
and (f) enhanced speech using proposed 
method. 
 
Comparing the waveforms of enhanced 
speech shown in Figs. 4(c)-(f), background 
noise can be efficiently removed in some 
noise-dominated regions by the adaptive 
thresholding method shown in Fig. 4(e). The 
waveform envelope of enhanced speech seems 
to vary more than the other methods. It results 
in more annoying residual noise. Speech 
quality can be maintained by preserving the 
speech signals in a speech-dominated region 
for the four speech enhancement methods. 
Although the residual noise seems to be 
comparable among the four methods shown in 
Figs. 4(c) - 4(f), the envelope of residual noise 
in Fig. 4(f) (proposed method) tends to vary 
more smoothly than the other three methods. 
This smoother envelope is beneficial in 
suppressing the burst change of residual noise 
signals, making this noise sound less annoying 
to the human ears.  
 
G. Spectrograms 
In order to yield more information about 
residual noise and speech distortion, we 
analyze the time-frequency distribution of 
enhanced speech and evaluate the structure of 
residual noise by observing speech 
spectrograms. Figures 5 and 6 present 
spectrogram comparisons for various speech 
enhancement methods. Speech signals are 
corrupted by F16-cockpit (stationary) and 
babble (non-stationary) noise signals with 
Avg_SegSNR = 0 dB. Figure 5 indicates that a 
speech signal is seriously corrupted by 
F16-cockpit noise (Fig. 5(b)). Comparing Figs. 
5(c) - 5(f), the proposed (Fig. 5(f)) and the 
adaptive thresholding (Fig. 5(e)) algorithms 
can almost remove the narrow-band spectra of 
F16-cockpit noise, which is distributed over 
2.6 and 2.9 kHz (Fig. 5(b)), while the speech 
spectra are not severely deteriorated. In 
addition, the proposed method also has least 
residual noise containment among the four 
speech enhancement methods. This fact 
enables the residual noise to sound less 
annoying. Observing the speech-pause regions 
in Figs. 5(c) - 5(f), the random spectral peaks 
with large energy are also fewer in the 
proposed algorithm (Fig. 5(f)). In addition, the 
amount of spectra for residual noise below 
 13 
the proposed method is also slightly better 
able to reduce the amounts of residual noise.

H. Listening tests 
 A subjective measure reflects the way the 
signal is perceived by listeners. Such a 
measure expresses how pleasant the signal 
sounds. Herein, the mean opinion score 
(MOS) was used to evaluate the global 
appreciation of the residual noise 
contamination and the speech distortion. The 
subjective listening tests were conducted with 
eleven listeners. Each listener gave each test 
signal a score between one and five. Table 4 
presents the results of performance 
comparison in terms of the MOS measure. 
Initially, the clean and the noisy speech 
signals corrupted by F16-cockpit noise were 
 15 
added noise, but also cause the envelope of 
residual noise to vary smoother (Fig. 4(f)) 
than the other methods (Figs. 4 (c) - 4(e)). It 
enables the residual noise to sound less 
annoying. Therefore, the proposed method 
obtains the highest values of MOS given in 
Table 4.  On the contrary, the waveform 
envelope of the adaptive thresholding method 
shown in Fig. 4(e) varies more than the other 
three methods, especially during 
speech-pause regions. It yields musical 
residual noise which sounds annoying to the 
human ears. Accordingly, the adaptive 
thresholding algorithm achieves the lowest 
values of MOS given in Table 4.  
 
3.結論 
Integrating both the intra-frame masking 
properties of the human ears and the 
inter-frame SNR variation to adapt the gain 
factor of a subband was proposed. 
Experimental results show that this gain 
factor can efficiently remove residual noise, 
while the spectral deterioration of an 
enhanced speech signal is maintained at an 
acceptable level. This is attributed to the 
following two reasons: the first one is that 
employing a masking property to adapt a gain 
factor would preserve the residual noise 
which is imperceptible to the human ears. 
This preservation of noise brings the benefit 
of a reduction in speech distortion. The 
second reason is that using the inter-frame 
SNR variation to adapt a gain factor can 
reduce the spectral variation in successive 
frames for each subband. Thus, the random 
spectral peaks of residual noise are reduced, 
enabling the musical effect of residual noise 
to be reduced. Accordingly, the proposed 
approach offers less annoying residual noise 
than a method adapted by the SNR only or by 
the inter-frame SNR variation.

一、參加會議經過 
  本次會議為IASTED (International Association of Science and Technology for Development)舉
辦的國際研討會議，會議的地點是在泰國普吉島舉行，會議場所選在當地非常大的 Novotel 
飯店舉辦。為了增加會議主題的廣泛程度，IASTED在同一時間，同一地點舉辦三項主題的研
討會議，分別為： 
IASTED Advances in Computer Science and Engineering (ACSE), 2009 
IASTED Web-Based Education (WBE) 2009. 
IASTED Solar Energy (SOE) 2009. 
 
    凡是參與其中一項研討會的與會學者，可以前往任意一個會場聆聽自己感到有興趣的場
次與作者及期研究團隊作討論。在ACSE研討會議中，除了發表論文的作者之外，也有許多業
界人士前往參加會議，討論最新之研究成果。會議的主辦單位將已接受的論文分成6個場次 
(sessions)，並且以口頭報告的方式呈現研究成果，論文分類與研討會場次所包含的 sessions 
如下: 
1. Parallel Computing and BioInformation 
2. Computational Intelligence 
3. Software Engineering 
4. Computer Networks and Communication 
5. Computer Graphics and Web Technology 
6. Data Mining and Database Theory 
 
 本次大會將每天的會議分成2~3個時段，每個時段有4個oral presentation sessions 同時舉
行，每個 session 的時段為120~180分鐘，所以每篇論文有20分鐘的報告時間，與會人士可以
根據自己的研究興趣前往各個論文報告會場聽取作者作論文報告，並與作者做充分的討論與
意見交流。 
  為了讓與會學者有機會了解更多的資訊與工程研究領域，ACSE 大會也安排了幾個前瞻性
