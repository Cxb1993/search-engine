Abstract
We have investigated opportunistic multicast scheduling schemes for sending a multicast stream in a
wireless cell lately. Our scheme is able to preserve the feature of synchronization of served information by
conventional multicasting and allow for receivers only accepting sequential streaming data, besides
exploiting multiuser diversity gain and radio broadcast gain for multicast efficiency. The essential approach
is to take advantage of full knowledge of the expected sequence number of the stream and the feasible peak
data rate for each user, utilize the pair of state variables as two degrees of freedom for selection, and
determine a stream fragment starting from a selected sequence number to be sent at a selected peak rate in
current time slot. Particularly, the selected pair of variables is chosen to jointly maximize a utility function.
Past study has been focused on a group of multicast users with homogeneous channel conditions (i.e., iid
SNR). This report first presents results when our scheme is used for a multicast group consisting of two
homogeneous subgroups, serving as a simple scenario of heterogeneous channel conditions. We found that
for a given group size of twenty-four users, the characteristic of multicast throughput as a function of
reducing the subgroup size of far users is increasing and convex. We then report results when the
requirement of strict reliability for multicast delivery is released but subject to controllable streaming
information losses. Our approach is to use for each user a token bucket controller to regulate the amount and
rate of permissible information losses. Our results show that multicast throughput increases significantly,
which is however implicitly at the cost of coding requirement and delay.
4stream for a group of m users with time-varying channels. Each time slot hasseconds. Let the feasible peak
transmission rate for user or channel i at time n be denoted as Xi[n] nats/sec/Hz, a random variable depending
on the current SNR state of user i. Assume that Xi[n] nats/sec/Hz is stable during each time slot. The amount
of data carried at this rate in time n is then Xi[n] (nats/Hz). We will thus use variable Xi[n] to represent a
feasible peak rate or the volume of stream data carried in a slot, depending on the context. Assume that the BS
has full knowledge of current feasible peak rate states {Xi[n], i=1,2,, m}.
We usenats/Hz as a unit of measurement for the multicast stream. Assume that the BS maintains a list
of sequence numbers {bi[n]; i=1,2, ,m} where each number, say bi[n], points to the data unit of the multicast
stream from which user i expects to receive at time n. The number also implies that at the beginning of time n,
user i has already received all stream data with sequence numbers up to bi[n]. Let the data of a multicast
stream begin at sequence number zero. Initially, bi[0]= bi[1]=0nats/Hz for all i. Besides, let the information
lag between user i and a leading user at the beginning of time n be denoted by li[n]= max {1jm}bj[n]-bi[n]
(nats/Hz). The throughput of a multicast scheduling policy A for a group of m users is defined as

A. Opportunistic multicast scheduling MaxLWeBV and LaxLGeBV[11]
The fundamental approach is to choose from current state information{(Xi[n] , bi[n]); i[1,m]} a pair of
feasible peak rate and sequence number (Xk[n] , bj[n]) which determines a fragment of stream data with
sequence numbers in [ bj[n], bj[n]+ Xk[n]) and then sends it starting from bj[n] at rate Xk[n] in slot n. As the
fragment arrives at a user, say i, it is decodable if Xi[n]Xk[n] for better channel quality and undecodable
otherwise.
For user i, a decodable fragment [ bj[n], bj[n]+ Xk[n]) of stream data is received as a complete duplicated
copy if bj[n]+ Xk[n] bi[n], as a proper copy comprising a duplicated part [ bj[n], bi[n]] and an expected one
[ bi[n], bj[n]+ Xk[n]) fit in sequential order if bj[n]bi[n]< bj[n]+ Xk[n], or as a future copy if bi[n]< bj[n].
Main components of a utility function:
1.) A sequential receiving constraint and eBV: Under the constraint of receiving stream data sequentially,
a receiver will only accept the expected copy of an arrival fragment and discard all duplicated or future ones
that are out of sequence. Let I{} denote an indicator function. From the stream fragment [ bj[n], bj[n]+ Xk[n])
sent at rate Xk[n] at time n, user i will receive and accept the amount (bj[n]+ Xk[n]bi[n])+ I_{ Xi[n] Xk[n],
bj[n]bi[n]} of multicast data. The eBV at time n, denoted by vl,k[n] , for a group of m users thus amounts to

2.) A force to limit information lags: Note that if all expected sequence numbers in (2) are of the same
6been optimized for current group composition. The label Opti-normalized-parameter indicates that the pair
values have been optimized after the component mlj in the exponent of (4) is replaced bymlj/E[Xj] for
current group composition. Note that the normalizing factor E[Xj ] is the mean peak feasible rate E[ln(1 +
SNRj)] for user j. As we can see from Fig. 1, the performance of MaxLGeBV is little affected by the
parameter (m,m) chosen in different ways as long as the number of far users dominates the composition of a
multicast group. As far users are in the minority, it improves if the pair are optimized for current group
composition and improves more if the normalized lag lj/E[Xj] is used instead in the weight function for
scheduling. This suggests that the exponent in (4) should be changed tomlj/E[Xj] +mu[n], on account of
nonuniform group composition. On the other hand, for the scenario of nonuniform group considered so far we
can view each subgroup as an individual multicast group and split air-time resource to serve each of them
independently but for the same information stream. For example, suppose that there are 12 of 0 dB users and
12 of 12 dB users in a multicast group of size 24. It has been shown in [11] that the throughput of MaxLGeBV
is 2.03 (10.06) for a group of 12 users all with 0dB (12 dB) SNR. Simply by hard splitting time resource for
serving each subgroup in alternate slots, the combined throughput is (2.03 + 10.06)/2 ≈ 6.05, which is much
better than the maximum throughput of 3.63 shown in Fig. 1 when those 24 users are dealt with as a single
group. However, this will give rise to an infinite information lag between users in the two subgroups.
IV. OMS with controllable information losses
Our previous OMSs have been designed to ensure reliable multicast stream delivery. If the multicast data
is not loss-sensitive due to traffic characteristics or encoding, we can exploit this feature and develop
opportunistic multicasting schemes that allow data losses but subject to the regulation of token-bucket
algorithm [18,19]. The fundamental approach is to use for each user a token bucket controller that limits the
largest amount of streaming data losses in one slot and the long-term rate of information losses. Specifically,
the burst of information losses for user i in one slot is constrained by the amount of tokens remaining in the
bucket associated with the user. Token generation rate is used to control the long-term rate of information
losses. Thus, it is obviously important to utilize those credits in the bucket efficiently.
We consider four approaches to utilize token credits:
A. Conservative
After determining the fragment of multicast data with sequence numbers in [bj*[n], bj*[n]+Xk*[n] and
the transmission rate Xk*[n] at time n, by (4), the scheduler further searches for users that can receive
data at rate Xk*[n] and have enough token credits to cover possibly a segment of information loss.
Token credits are then destroyed accordingly, which is equivalently to discard the segment of
information expected by associated users. We use the notation Consv to denote this approach.
B. Greedy
For each transmission, the approach jointly utilizes both current state information {(Xi[n] , bi[n]); i
[1,m]} and token credit information for each user i to exhaustively select a pair of transmission rate
and data sequence number according to (4), slot by slot. Because the procedure of maximization, this
