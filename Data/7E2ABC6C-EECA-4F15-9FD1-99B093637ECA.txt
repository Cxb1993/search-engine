Abstract
Accurate assessment of image fidelity is fundamental to the development of digital
imaging systems that require quality image reproduction. In this project, a color
visual model for estimating the just noticeable color difference (JNCD) for color
pixels and an image quality metric based on the model for predicting the quality of the
reproduced color image is presented. Based on the latest color difference equation
of CIEDE2000, the image quality metrics are designed to take only the part of the
distortion that is perceivable by the HVS, or the part of the distortion that exceeds just
JNCD. The JNCD of each pixel is to be measured by the proposed color visual
model as the visibility threshold of distortion and is considered as a function of local
image properties including background uniformity, luminance gradient, and average
background luminance. The validity of the proposed quality metric will be verified
by using the image distortion maps that are to be obtained empirically from the pairs
of the original and reproduced images in the spatio-temporal domain by a number of
subjects under a specified viewing condition. Several color image fidelity metrics,
such as RGB RMSE, S-CIELAB E, CIEDE2000 E00, will also be evaluated with
the same image distortion maps for comparison. To be precise, the tristimulus
values of the color pixels involved in the metric computation are all represented in the
device-independent CIE XYZ space, which are computed from the calibrated
recommended by International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1976 to
overcome the non-uniform color metric that had been discussed by MacAdam and
many others [11]. Even though CIELAB is not a perfect uniform color space, the
metric is satisfactory for measuring perceptual difference between large uniform
patches of colors. A modification of the E formula was released by CIE in 1994
based on new experimental data [12]. Nevertheless, the CIELAB metrics are not
suitable for measuring the fidelity of natural images, since many related studies found
that color discrimination of human vision depends on spatial content of the image [13].
The S-CIELAB metric, a spatial extension to CIELAB, incorporates the different
sensitivities to spatial frequencies of the three opponent color channels by adding a
spatial pre-processing step before the standard CIELABE calculation [14]. Due to
the lack of contrast masking mechanism in the metric, the S-CIELAB metric still fails
to accurately measure the perceptible distortion in the reproduction of
JPEG-compressed images. To obtain a more uniform color metric, a number of
advanced color difference equations based on the CIE Colorimetry have been
developed [16]. Among these color difference equations, CIEDE2000 is the latest one
developed by following the procedures agreed by CIE Technical Committee [15].
Since the human observer is the gold standard in validating the image quality metric,
the accuracy and reliability of a fidelity metric is closely related to the psychophysical
experiment used for validating the metric. The simplest approach for validating a
quality metric is to use the rating scale suggested by CCIR Recommendation 500-3
[17], where the adjective descriptions including bad, poor, fair, good and excellent are
given for evaluation. The limitation of the rating scale assessment is that it can only
characterize relatively large differences in image quality and may give inconsistent
scores when evaluating images with different types of distortions. The method of
paired comparison is also a commonly used technique to validate the image quality
metric [18], where images are compared to one another and the judgment is made for
each pair of images. The JND approach conducted by [19] is realized by pointing
the compressed image out of a pair of images containing the original image and being
repetitively presented to the subjects a period of time. The advantage of JND
experiments is that they are less biased by the differences in the types of distortions,
while the disadvantage is that they may be affected by the time span of image display,
the way of distortion search and learning effect. By considering that image quality
varies across the image, paired comparison is applied to sub images as well as a
visible difference map [20].
In [14], the image distortion maps are empirically obtained by subjects who identified
regions in the reproduced images that appeared to be different from the original image,
and used as the response of the HVS to validate the metrics including RMS, CIELAB
and S-CIELAB. The image distortion map in this case is actually the map of the
probabilistic measure for each pixel that the distortion imposed on the pixel is
perceivable. The agreement between metrics and the empirical HVS response is
inspected by taking the metric as the signal detector that tries to predict the response
of the HVS. After sampling some critical image pixels for analysis, the hit rate (HR)
and false alarm rate (FAR) of the metric are calculated where a constant threshold
level of the metric is used for the calculation. A good metric should have high hit
rates and low false alarm rates.  The accuracy of each metric in predicting the HVS’s 
response can be revealed by representing the hit rate as a function of false alarm rate,
or the ROC curve [21]. The experimental results obtained in [14] show that all RMS,

ROC curve closest to the upper left corner.
Simulation Results
The distortion marks pointed out by the subjects will be recorded for each pair of
images. From the pooled data, the probability of each pixel being marked as having
perceptible distortion in a reproduced image will be calculated. The profile of the
probabilities measured for all pixels of the image is termed as image distortion maps.
The distortion map of one of the test images which is partially low-pass filtered is
shown in Fig. 3, and the distortion map of a partially JPEG-compressed image is
shown in Fig. 4. With these distortion maps, scores of different metrics are used to
compute HR and FAR for forming the corresponding ROC curves shown in Figs. 5
and 6. The closer the ROC curve moves toward the upper left corner, the more
accurate the corresponding metric can locate the perceptible distortion with the
corresponding metric score, and more corresponds to the perception of the HVS.

where kg,i, andi for i=R, G, B are respectively gains and gammas
of three color primaries, and N the number of bits for representing
each digital count. Constant gains and gammas are calculated to
minimize the error between measured XYZ values and predicted
XYZ values. As applying the GOG model to characterize LCDs,
the prediction error is not always found acceptable. This is due
to the channel interaction among R, G, B channels that leads to the
lack of additivity along the three colorimetric axes, and results in
the inaccuracy in predicting the XYZ tristimulus values [6]. The
sources that induce channel interaction include the optical cross
talk due to insufficient response of the color filter, the cross talk
due to capacitive coupling between electrodes, and the internal
structure of the LCD [6-7]. As shown in Figure 1, the channel
interaction presented in LCDs can be demonstrated by the
difference between the TRC of the R(B) channel measured from
the ramp of red (blue) colors with digital counts dG=dB=0
(dG=dR=0) and the TRC of the R(B) channel measured from the
ramp of gray colors with dR=dG=dB.
3. The weighted masking Model
To effectively model the channel interaction in characterizing the
colorimetry of LCDs, the concept of UCR is adopted in
representing colors. The RGB digital counts of a color are
replaced by those corresponding to the primary color (P) of R, G,
or B, the secondary color (S) of cyan (C), magenta (M), or yellow
(Y), and the tertiary color of grey (K). As shown in Figure 2, the
color in RGB is replaced by red, yellow, and grey. The digital
count of grey is equal to the smallest of the RGB digital counts.
The digital count of secondary color corresponds to the difference
between the middle and the smallest RGB digital counts. The
digital count of primary color corresponds to the difference
between the largest and the middle RGB digital counts. The
channel interaction in this case is modeled through the
dissimilarity among the TRCs of the R, G, B channels that
constitute the secondary and tertiary colors. In addition to the
nonlinear approximation of channel interaction, the correlation
among spectral radiances of primary, sencondary and tertiary
colors is also considered in the linear transformation from
radiometric scalars to the XYZ tristimulus values. Therefore, the
XYZ values of the color with the digital counts of (dR, dG, dB) is
estimated by the proposed model as the weighted sum of the XYZ
values of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors as

where dL = min(dR, dG, dB), dM = medium (dR, dG, dB), and dH =

ÎP(x) is the estimated XYZ values of the primary color with the
digital counts of (x, 0, 0) for P=R, (0, x, 0) for P=G, and (0, 0, x)
for P=B.
ÎS(x) is the estimated XYZ values of the secondary color with the
digital counts of (0, x, x) for S=C, (x, 0, x) for S=M, and (x, x, 0)
for S=Y.
ÎK(x) is the estimated XYZ values of the gray color with the digital
count of (x, x, x).
The estimation process of the model is also illustrated by the
block diagram shown in Figure 3 where the input digital counts
are first sorted to determine the primary and secondary colors and
the gray level of the tertiary color.

5. Conclusion
A mathematical model is presented in this paper for characterizing
the colorimetry of the LCDs that have the inherent problems of
channel interaction and channel-chromaticity nonconstancy. The
effect of channel interaction is considered in the model by
representing colors as the linear combination of primary,
secondary and tertiary colors of UCR. The TRCs of the R, G, B
channels that constitute the sencondary colors and grey colors are
measured, and the weights that correlate the spectral radiances of
the three constituent colors are also measured for predicting the
XYZ values of the color to be displayed on the LCD being
characterized. The comparison of estimation accuracy indicates
that the proposed model is in average superior to the conventional
models in colorimetric characterization of LCDs, and particularly
successful in characterizing the LCDs where channel interaction is
apparent, such as the display using color sequential techniques.

Abstract
Accurate colorimetric characterization is an important step in
establishing the color management system (CMS) for liquid
crystal displays (LCDs). The difficulty in achieving accurate
characterization of LCDs is mainly due to cross talks among color
channels. In this paper, a model based on the concept of under
color removal (UCR) and utilizing the correlations among color
components is proposed to accurately estimate the XYZ values of
the colors displayed on LCDs. Experimental results indicate
that the proposed model outperforms many existing models in
terms of the CIEDE2000 color difference between the XYZ values
of the measured color samples and the estimated XYZ values.
1. Introduction
Flat-panel LCDs have become increasingly popular as TV and
computer displays and been expected to eventually replace CRT
displays due to their superior features including less power
consumption, higher luminance and contrast ratio and versatility
in placement. In order to achieve a correct color reproduction on
LCDs, it is important to establish an accurate CMS for LCDs to
handle colors based on device-independent XYZ tristimulus
values. For this purpose, the relationship between input digital
counts that drive the LCD and the radiance output in XYZ
tristimulus values must be accurately modeled, in which the
nonlinear relationship between each color channel’s digital count 
and the associated radiometric scalar is always described by a
optoelectronic transfer function (OETF), or known as tone
reproduction curve (TRC),. Many researches have been
conducted to present mathematical models for characterizing the
TRCs of LCDs [1-5]. The GOG model [1] is a famous model for
its accuracy in characterizing the colorimetry of CRT displays.
However, it has been found inadequate to characterize LCDs due
to the presence of channel interaction and non-constancy of
channel chromaticity. The S-curve model [2] and polynomial
models [3] have the same two-stage structure as GOG model in
characterizing LCDs but have different ways in describing the
nonlinear relationship between digital counts and radiometric
scalars. The S-shaped function defined for each color channel in
the S-curve model involves the affection from other two color
channels. The matrix model [4] takes the channel interaction
into account by including cross terms as regression variables.
These models, however, are not accurate enough for the
characterization of LCDs because of the effect of channel
interaction is not well handled in these models. In [5], the
technique of UCR often used in color printing is employed to
characterize the LCDs with channel interaction by the method of
principal component analysis (PCA). With the PCA on color
channels of more than red (R), green (G) and blue (B), the XYZ
values are estimated by the linear combination of higher-order
principal components with the coefficients approximated by
spline interpolation for all possible digital counts. In [8],
channel interaction among color channels is considered by
modeling the gain and gamma parameters of each color channel’s 
GOG model as functions of input digital counts. In this paper,
the XYZ values are estimated by considering not only the channel
interaction that shapes the TRCs of the R, G, B channels
differently in different color components as obtained according to
the concept of UCR but also the correlation among them.
2. Channel interaction
Many conventional models including GOG [1-3] have a two-stage
structure in characterizing display devices. The first stage is a
nonlinear process that relates input digital counts of R, G, B
channels with radiometric scalars. The second stage consists of
a matrix that linearly transforms the radiometric scalars to the
XYZ tristimulus values as the resulting spectral radiance. By
taking backlight leakage into account, the linear transformation is
obtained as

For instance, the R and B channels’ TRCs of magenta are 
measured from the test colors of (d, 0, d) with d having a ramp of
16 evenly spaced levels. The third step is to linearly transform
the normalized radiometric scalars (R’/Rmax, G’/Gmax, B’/Bmax) to
the XYZ values as the resulting spectral radiance through Eq. (1),
where the maximum driving signals of three color channels and
the backlight leakage can be measured by the spectral colorimeter
like PR650. In the final step, the modeling of channel
interaction is further refined by taking the correlations among the
spectral radiances of the primary, secondary and tertiary colors
into consideration. With an adequate number of sample colors,
the weights of wK(P,S), wS(P,S), wP(P,S) for a particular set of
primary and secondary colors can be obtained by minimizing the
mean square estimation error,= I(dR, dG, dB)-Î(dR, dG, dB), where
I(dR, dG, dB) denotes the XYZ values of the LCD measured by a
spectral colorimeter. By letting
the weights can be derived as

To verify the proposed model, the estimation accuracy in terms of
the CIEDE2000 color difference between the predicted XYZ
values and the measured XYZ values is evaluated. Three LCDs,
Philips 150S4, Compaq 5017m and the color sequential display
developed by ChungHwa Picture Tubes, LTD (CPT CSD) are
used in the evaluation, on which more than 400 test colors are
displayed and measured with PR650. The weights measured for
the three LCDs under different orders of digital counts are shown
in Tables I and III. The comparison in accuracy with the
conventional GOG model [1], S-curve model, polynomial model
[3], and channel-dependent GOG model [8] is shown in Table I.
