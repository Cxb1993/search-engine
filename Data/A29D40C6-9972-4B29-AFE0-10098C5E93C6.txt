Abstract   
Micro welding is a new research field, the highly development of photoelectric, MEMS and 
soft electronics industries make it inherently attractive for joining applications. In addition, Fe-Ni 
metal film has great physical properties such as high magnetism, high corrosion resistance and 
low coefficient of thermal expansion, and can be electroformed with proper thickness; therefore, 
it is suitable for applications where the accuracy demand or temperature is high. In this study, a 
3D final element model is introduced to investigate the temperature distribution and 
characteristics of nugget formation for micro resistance spot welding of Fe-Ni metal film. The 
results showed that the electrode design is a critical factor for nugget formation during the micro 
welding process. The stepped electrode with large upper diameter can reduce the ratio of the 
contact resistance of electrode/metal film interface to that of the faying surface. Thus, the better 
temperature distribution in workpieces can be obtained. It is not only possible to prompt the 
nugget formation but also to reduce the electrode sticking effect and increase electrode life.

溫度分佈與銲核生成特性。獲得之結論如下
所述： 
(1)高長細比柱狀電極所產生之高電阻與高
溫效應，將使熱量無法集中於鐵鎳金屬

(2)採用階梯狀電極時，銲核中心溫度將高於
電極/金屬薄膜界面中心溫度，並且當銲

Additionally, because of melting is not involved, the energy input used for FSW is 
considerably low. The HAZs associated with the welds consequently, can be relatively small. 
Moreover, shielding gases are not used during FSW process [2]. 
In the automotive industry, resistance spot welding (RSW) is the most common technique for 
assembling steel sheets. A number of advantages make RSW as an ideal joining technique for 
mass production [3]. The application of lightweight materials recently is reflected in the 
increasing use of aluminum alloys. However, many problems will arise in resistance spot 
welding of aluminum alloy sheets due to their high thermal and electrical conductivity. These 
problems include weld porosity, fast electrode wear, and inconsistent failure modes [4]. 
Friction stir spot welding (FSSW) is a variant of the linear friction stir welding. It has recently 
received considerable attention from the automotive and other industries. FSSW was 
developed and patented by GKSS, a German company, in 1999 [5]. In addition, Mazda and 
Toyota have introduced FSSW technology to join aluminum sheet metal body panels. In 
comparison with the conventional resistance spot welding of Al alloys, Mazda reported that 
there is over 90 percent operation energy savings [6].  
Several variations in FSSW processing have been developed and patented after a decade of 
development [7]. Two approaches are used in this type of welding. One employs a fixed pin 
tool geometry and the other utilizes a retractable pin with a clamping ring. The former will 
leave a characteristic exit hole in the middle of the joint after the pin retracted. However, the 
latter is capable of refilling the void typically created by the pin [8]. 
The refilling approach could result in better weld strength. But it would require relatively long 
processing time to accommodate the complex motions of the tool to fill the hole. 
Comparatively, the fixed pin approach is faster. A weld can be made in less than one second 
for Al alloys. Also, the welding machine and control system for the retractable pin approach is 
complicated and difficult to integrate on a high-volume mass production assembly line [9]. 
The critical issues related to the FSSW weld quality are tool geometry and welding process 
parameters. Several fundamental aspects for FSSW process are remaining to be studied in 
detail. The most commonly numerical method used to solve complex problems is finite 
element method (FEM). Up to now, many studies effort in modeling FSW have been 
published [10-14]. And some works for modeling FSSW are also presented in public [15-16]. 
However, there are still lack of studies dedicate to FSSW process, especially with mesh free 
methods. There are two main objectives of this study, the first is to evaluate the SPH based 
model for the simulation of FSSW process, and the second is to investigate the effect of pin 
shape on material mixing of friction stir spot welds.

Where δ  is the dirac function. 
The computational SPH model consists of a finite number of mass particles spread over 
certain space, which is achieved by introduction of the particle approximation. The 
continuous approximate integral form Eq. (3) has to be transformed into a discretised form of 
particle summations in the influence domain. The particle approximation  of the function 
u and the approximation of gradients can be expressed as follows： 
uΠ h
                                                                       (6) ∑

Using the sum over particles for integral approximation is of crucial importance and ensures 
that the SPH method does not depend on any background mesh during the numerical 
integration. The governing equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation can be 
written in the following form：

3. TOOL DESIGN AND FSSW PROCESS 
 
Welding process times for RSW consist of squeeze time, weld time and hold time. They vary 
according to sheet thickness and are influenced by the squeeze time required for weld cooling. 
Typical welding process times are well under 1 second for welding two 1mm-thickness sheets. 
As FSSW is considered to be an alternative welding technique for assembling car bodies, 
cycle time of FSSW becomes an important factor when weighing cost of producing a weld. 
Several studies indicated that refilling approach is difficult to meet the requirement due to the 
 4
4. NUMERICAL SIMULATION 
 
The model of FSSW process has been done using ANSYS/LS-DYNA software. Thermal 
analysis on the pin hole was performed first. It is a transient thermal analysis which 
determines temperature and other thermal quantities that vary over time. The workpieces have 
been modeled in circular geometry with diameter of 40mm and the thickness of 1mm. All 
parts included in the model were meshed with tetrahedron element for implicit calculations. 
As shown in Fig.3, a total of 43,131 elements and 10,820 nodes have been generated in the 
model. In addition, heat generation Qi at each interface of the tool/workpieces was based on 
the same equation as below: 
              AωrτFωrMωQ dddd contact===                                                        (11) 
where ω is tool angular rotation speed, M is torque, r is position along tool radius, τcontact is 
contact shear stress and A is area.

Because FSSW is a highly deformable process, it is difficult to simulate this process in 3D 
using lagrangian finite elements. Also, the implementation of remeshing concept does not 
work well with 3D solid elements. Therefore, the proposed FSSW mechanical model in this 
study was based on the explicit SPH method.  In order to save the computation time, the 
workpieces were modeled using SPH nodes in combination with lagrangian elements. The 
model with three-fork tool is shown as Fig. 4, it was meshed with a total of 5460 elements, 
7880 nodes and 17374 SPH particles.  
Workpieces are subjected to severe deformation at very high strain rates and temperatures; as 
a result, there are many variables that control the deformation of work-piece. In this study, 
workpieces were modeled using Johnson Cook material model, and tool is modeled with rigid

Figure 7 shows the plastic strain distribution of the weld, the SPH particles move away from 
upper surface of workpiece during the welding process. It suggests that the explicit SPH 
method was effectively used for modeling the extremely large deformation of the FSSW 
process. In addition, the SPH particles move more violently for using the three-fork tool than 
cylindrical tool due to the better stirring. In these cases, the related tool rotating speed is 
1000rpm, feed rate is 2mm/sec and the penetrating depth is 1.2mm.

The effect of tool geometry on material mixing mechanism can also be simulated by SPH 
approach. The arrow plots of SPH particles displacements around both of the tools are shown 
in Fig. 8. It shows that the three-fork tool resulted in larger displacements than those of 
cylindrical tool. Besides, a number of particles moving around the three-fork tool surface are 
found.  It will produce a better mixing and thus joining. Fig. 9 depicts the relationship of 
velocity field and tool geometry further.

6. CONCLUSIONS  
 
A SPH based modeling approach has been proposed for the simulation and analysis of the 
FSSW process. One of the most unique and attractive characteristics of the SPH method is the 
harmonious combination of the Lagrangian formulation and particle approximation. In 
addition, the momentum dominated flow can be easily modeled with a proper number of SPH 
particles.   
It is well known that tool geometry plays an important role for the quality of FSSW welds. A 
new tool design has been investigated in this study. At present, the tool and its variant shapes 
are in the process of test. Both of the simulation and experimental results revealed that a 
proper material mixing flow could improve the efficiency of the FSSW process significantly.

ABSTRACT 
 
Friction stir spot welding (FSSW) has become an attractive technique for the applications in 
automotive and other industries due to the features of solid-state bonding and many 
accompanied advantages of the process. Recently, this new joining technique has been 
considered as an alternative welding process to replace resistance spot welding (RSW) in 
auto-body assembly. The aim of this study lies both in designing a new tool and 
characterizing the thermo-mechanical phenomena for the FSSW process. This new tool is a 
simple fixed pin device. In addition, a three-dimensional simulation model of the FSSW 
process has been conducted to optimize the tool design and process parameters. Because it is 
difficult to reduce element distortions in high deformation simulations, a combination of 
lagrangian and mesh free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) elements is implemented. 
The results of the simulations revealed that the proper tool design could effectively improve 
the efficiency of the FSSW process.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining technology. It was invented and 
experimentally proven by The Welding Institute UK in 1991 [1]. FSW produces structural 
joints superior to conventional arc welds in several lightweight alloys. The benefits of FSW 
welds include higher strength, increased fatigue life, lower distortion, less residual stress, less 
sensitivity to corrosion, and essentially defect-free joints compared to fusion welding.

2. SPH METHOD PRINCILELES 
 
SPH is a meshless lagrangian method developed initially to simulate astrophysical problems. 
However, it has known important developments these last years for resolving conservation 
laws. Meshless methods offer considerable promise in areas where the traditional finite 
element approximations have encountered difficulties due to the need to continually remesh 
the domain. These methods can avoid the difficult task of generating 3D mesh, and are ideal 
for problems which need remeshing, such as adaptivity, fracture problems, large irregular 
geometry and large deformation problems [17].  
SPH particles not only used as interpolation points, they also carry material properties, 
functioning as both approximation points and material components. These particles are 
capable of moving in space, carry all computed information, and thus form the computational 
frame for solving the partial differential equations describing the conservation laws. Basically, 
the SPH method consists of two key tasks. The first represents the integral representation and 
the second is the particle approximation. 
Particle methods are based on quadrature formulas on moving particles , P is 
the set of the particles, xi(t) is the location of particle i and wi(t) is the weight of the particle. 
As the particles are moved along the characteristic curves of the field c and also the weigths 
are modified with the divergence of the flow, the volume is conserved [18]:

Then, the following quadrature formula can be written: 
                                                                                  (3) ∑∫

To define the smoothing function W, an auxiliary function (y)θ  is needed. The most common 
function used by the SPH community is the cubic B-spline which has some good properties of 
regularity. W is defined by:

amount of material which must be formed and reformed. Moreover, the thermal expansion of 
the tool is another challenge in complicated refilling tool design.  Badarinarayan et al. [19] 
imposed an experimentally determined the effect of thermal expansion of the tool during 
FSSW of aluminum sheets. A typical FSSW tool made from H13 stretched out about 1% in 
length was recorded. In author’s previous study, we also noticed that the sticking problems in 
a common refilling tool were inevitable after a certain welding cycles. Thus, a fixed pin 
approach for FSSW was investigated in this study. 
There were two different pin profiles used in FSSW process simulations to characterize their 
temperature fields and associated mechanical effects. The tool shoulder diameter is 12 mm, 
the pin outer diameter is 6mm and pin length is 2.1mm. Figure 1 shows the schematic of 
FSSW tool geometries, a conventional cylindrical pin and the proposed three-fork pins with 
rounded ends.

In this study, aluminum alloy 6061-T6 with thickness of 2mm was chosen as a material for 
simulations, and the workpieces were spot welded in lap-joint configuration. The FSSW 
process consists of three phases including tool plunging, stirring and withdraw. Figure 2 
shows the details of the welding process. In addition, the critical welding parameters 
including tool rotating speed, feed rate, and dwell time at the bottom of the feed were 
investigated. (plunge depth is 2.3mm).

material model. The contact conditions control the friction and master-slave relationships 
between the tool and the workpieces. In this case of mechanical analysis, the contact between 
tool and workpieces was defined using contact constraint nodes to surface, and the coupling 
between lagrangian elements and SPH particles was defined using contact tied nodes to 
surface. These contact definitions are based on constraint equations.

cylindrical and three-fork tools, respectively. The process parameters were fixed as follows: 
Tool rotation speed 500rpm, feed rate 1mm/sec and the elapsed time 0.99second.

The maximum temperature is around the pin, and it is higher with the three-fork tool than 
with cylindrical tool. When the stirring phase starts, the maximum temperature with the three-
fork tool reaches 540  after a dwell time of 2 seconds. The temperature distribution along 
the interface of workpieces is shown in Fig. 6.
