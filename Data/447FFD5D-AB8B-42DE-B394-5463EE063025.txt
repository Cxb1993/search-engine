We developed a knowledge-based intelligent systematic approach using existing databases 
and data mining techniques to identify and verify the various distinctive genotypes of 
diseases/cancers in Taiwan. The first year we proposed system supports dictionary base browse 
and full-text search. The input of proposed system is a disease or a keyword, and output will be 
the relevant information, a risk analysis or an experimental design that can be tested to further 
confirm a diagnosis either extrinsic in cause (infectious pathogens) or intrinsic in genome 
(hereditary disease, multiple genes). The proposed system analyzes current diseases/cancers and 
related genomic information from existing databases and our value added databases, and provides 
probes, PCR primer kits and related decision models to identify the genotypes of diseases/cancers. 
At last year, we investigate the correlation between different popular diseases known by share 
genes on OMIM(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) and other risk factors such like sex and 
age. The chronic diseases such high blood pressure, osteoarthritis and cancers have a lot of other 
risk factors that affect people’s health, not just involved by genes. We not only check the diseases 
induced by genes from OMIM but also want to find whether the risk factors which have impacts 
on those diseases play a more important role in epidemiology. Maybe there are some diseases we 
have not found the correlation between each other. We attempt to construct a disease-disease 
network in a new relation and detect what doesn’t find between the diseases and human in 
epidemiology in Taiwan.

The aim here is to create a knowledge-based intelligent system using existing databases and 
data mining techniques to identify the causes of human diseases and determine the various 
distinctive genotypes of cancers in Taiwan. 
Three sub-systems will be created to accomplish the aim of the proposed system: 
Disease knowledge-based intelligent system: includes 
 the disease knowledge base which is updateable with the newest related information 
 a user friendly and integrated query interface 
Probe/primer design system for determining disease genotype: could generate probes or 
primers for infectious or heritable disease and avoids cross-hybridization as far as possible. This 
sub-system includes 
 an infectious disease analysis system 
 a heritable disease/cancer analysis system 
Critical genetic factor analysis system: takes advantage of data mining and statistical 
measurement, such as a decision tree, a Bayesian network and SVM, to analyze the data on the 
patient profiles and experimental results, and provides critical genetic factors for disease and 
disease genotype data model to the user.

we investigate the correlation between different popular diseases and their risk factors which have 
impacts on those diseases from the Bureau of National Health Insurance.

Figure 2 Two disease’s intersection 
 
Both the two disease share the same gene or interaction proteins. One patient who gets 
disease A may also get disease B since the disease A and disease B have share the same gene or 
protein-protein interactions. There are four situations as following: 
1. One set includes patients who get disease A but don’t get disease B.  
2. The second set includes patients who get disease B but don’t get disease A. 
3. The another set includes patients who get both disease A and disease B. 
4. The final set includes people who don’t get either disease A or disease B. 
5. The data are displayed in a 2 x 2 table, as in Table 1. It is one of the contingency tables. 
McNemar’s test are two-sample test for binomial proportions for matched-pair data. 
 
 
Disease B 
Disease A  
Total present absent 
present a b a+b 
absent c d c+d 
Total a+c b+d N 
Table 1 McNemar’s test 
 
The proportion of the patients who got the disease A is p1, an the proportion of the patients 
who got the disease B is p2, which  p1 = a + c / N and p2 = a + b / N. 
McNemar’s test is one type of Chi-Square test which was introduced in 1947. It is used to 
test for the statistical significance of the difference between p1 and p2. The hypothesis is defined as 
following: 
H0: patients having disease A is independent with having disease B. 
H1: patients having disease A is dependent with having disease B. 
If p <0.05 we could reject H0, that means patients having disease “A” is associate with 
disease “B”. 
Disease A 
Disease B

have the diseases, so we use the given rule of odds ratio to check whether the pair of shared genes 
diseases impact on each other strongly or not. 
 
2.3 Network 
We construct the disease-disease network by the statistic test and network definition. 
A node implies a disease and an edge line implies the correlation between the two diseases. 
The edge line width is according to the pair of diseases correlation. If the pair of two diseases A 
and B is strongly contacted with each other, the edge width will be thick than the pair which has a 
weakly contact.

Table 3 The model of logistic regression that has 3 risk factors. 
 
From the table 3, we can get the β1, β2 and β3 to show the information from our data. where 
α is risk (in log scale) of developing disease for individual whose x’s are all zero. 
Thus, the β1 is the effect of renal failure adjusted for sex and age, the β2 is the effect of sex 
adjusted for renal failure and age, and the β3 is the effect of age adjusted for renal failure and sex.

we get a approximately value of β1. 
Finally, we can compare the value of  β1,  β2,  β3 , we can deduce that the effect of the

From the Figure 6 network which we construct by our methods, we find that the network is 
not similar to the original network produced by the both two diseases have the share genes. There 
are many disease pairs of share genes and protein-protein interactions which don’t have any 
common patients who got both disease A and disease B. This result shows that there are other risk 
factors of those diseases have impacts on the comorbidity of the diseases much strongly than the 
genes and proteins effect. According to the data, we also notice that the set of patients who get 
both disease A and disease B is small and has a few patients in it. In some case, the number of 
patients in the set of both share genes diseases group is zero. So we will consider the age and sex 
as factors in the following study.  
The following tables and figures are the statistic graph classified by age and sex, divided in 
10 years as a group.

From Figure 11 and 12, we can notice that the sex have influence on the different class of

Discussion 
From the case study and the network constructed by our statistic test. We can notice that the 
risk factors about age, sex and so on may have more influences than genes and protein-protein 
interactions of the comorbidity of diseases in Taiwan. 
Gender is well-known useful parameter for research and action in health more than in other 
20 
傳?整T傳?整T 
However, the Disease Network can be used for not only gene comorbidity patterns but also 
statistical comorbidity patterns. And there are a lot of disease pairs that are needed for 
investigation in our study. Our results show that age and sex are also important factors in 
disease-disease correlation. 
Clinical data should be considered in the study of system biology with human diseases. So 
we construct a disease network in statistical methods of clinical data from Bureau of National 
Health Insurance in Taiwan. 
In the future, we will plan to establish a web service using Cloud Computing and 
Applications in database, which offers information and what doctors and patients want to know 
and take care of. In this work, it is considered not only the share genes, protein-protein interaction 
and metabolism but also age, sex, region, drugs and other factors in comorbidity. Hope to establish 
a good service about medical research and bioinformatics.

The first year we design and create a disease knowledge-based intelligent system which 
working items are in Table 1. The results of our job are good for this plan and the proposed 
database will provide the access to the internet and contribute to international journals. 
The second year we designing and implementing the probe/primer design system which 
working items are in Table 2. The results of our job are good for this plan and  the proposed 
database will provide the access to the internet and contribute to international journals. 
At last year, we investigate the correlation between different popular diseases known by

human in epidemiology in Taiwan. 
Three major aims “Disease knowledge-based intelligent system” , ”Probe/primer design 
system for determining disease genotype” and “Critical genetic factor analysis system” are all 
completed in this project. And six papers of this project are published in international journals as
