Introduction 
Metallic glass is amorphous in structure, so that it contains no crystal anisotropy, 
dislocation, grain boundary nor crystalline defects [1]. Bulk metallic glasses (BMG) 
usually own peculiar properties such as ultra-high strength, high elasticity, high 
hardness, good toughness and excellent resistance to corrosion comparing to their 
crystalline counterparts [4-7]. Since 1988, a large number of BMG systems were 
developed in Mg- [8], La- [9], Zr- [10], Fe- [11-13], Pd- [14], Pt- [15], Ti- [16], Ni- 
[17, 18], and Ca- [19] alloy systems. These BMGs exhibit large critical glass forming 
size and high thermal stability to reveal a new possibility for industrial applications.  
In 1960, the binary Au82Si18 eutectic composition, being the first amorphous 
alloy with a size of below 50 μm in thickness, was synthesized by Duwez et al [2, 3]. 
However, the poor ‘glass forming ability’ (GFA) results in limited development in the 
past several decades.  
Recently, Johnson et al. and Inoue et al. exploited gold-base multi-component 
BMGs such as Au-Ag-Pd-Cu-Si and Au-Ag-Cu-Si alloy systems, respectively. These 
Au-based bulk metallic glasses possess lower ‘glass transition temperature’ (Tg) at 
most 128 oC (401 K), good thermal stability at ambient temperature, high hardness 
and better processing ability [20]. For Au-Ag-Pd-Cu-Si BMGs, the addition of Pd and 
Ag enhances GFA but increases Tg [3]. On the other hand, the increase of gold 
contents in Au-Ag-Cu-Si BMGs results in sharp decrease in Tg. The lowest reported 
Tg for the Au-based BMG is 66 
oC of Au70Cu5.5Ag7.5Si17 [20]. The above properties 
make possible applications for jewelry, IC-electronics, dentistry, micro-electro 
mechanical system (MEMS), nano-imprinting technology and so on [21, 22].  
The ‘newest’ BMG alloy system with low glass transition temperature is the 
calcium-based BMGs. In 2002, Inoue et al. first developed the ternary Ca-based 
BMGs in diameter of 2 mm such as Ca-Mg-Cu alloy systems [23]. Moreover, Guo et 
al. found the binary Ca-Al BMG (in diameter of 1 mm) in 2004 [24]. The largest size 
Ca-based BMG, in diameter 15 mm, is Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG obtained by Park et. Al., 
in 2003 [25]. Although the Ca-based BMGs possess low Tg, high glass forming ability 
and good Young’s modulus, there are no further applications. Hence exploration of 
new applications are very important than the cast size of Ca-based BMGs. 
Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) are among the most promising 
candidates to develop spintronic devices which benefit from the combination of 
electrical properties of semiconductors and spin characteristic of magnetic materials 
[26]. In recent years, group IV-based (Ge or Si) DMSs attract much attention due to 
the compatibility with existing industry of modern electronics. An early investigation 
of ferromagnetism in Ge96.5Mn3.5 grown by Molecule Beam Epitaxy showed Curie 
temperature (Tc) up to 116 K [27]. Magnetic semiconductors based on Ge100-xMnx 
low (~ 70 K), which is much lower than those observed in II-VI (such as doped ZnO) 
and III-V (such as GaMnAs) based DMSs. Due to this reason we want to develop a 
novel Si-based DMS material with both Tc and AHE above room temperature to be 
certain the origin of ferromagnetism. In our previous experiments last year, we 
observed AHE in a-Si1-xCrx:H and a-Si1-xMnx:H at 5 K and 150 K, respectively. Here 
we want to apply appropriate post-annealing treatment to further increase AHE 
temperature from 150 K to 300 K and even higher. 
 
Experiments 
    In this work, alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Au50Sn6Cu26Si18, 
Au50Sn6Cu24Si20, and Au50Sn9Cu23Si18, (Ca66.4Al33.6)100-xZnx (x = 5~20), Ca65Mg15Zn20 
were prepared by arc melting (Au alloys) or induction melting (Ca alloys) the 
mixtures of pure elements Au, Sn, Cu, Si, Ca, Al, Mg and Zn with purity at least 
99.8% under a vacuum 0.01 MPa. For homogeneity of the alloys, we melt the ingots 
six times each composition. BMG rods in diameter of 1 ~ 2 mm were fabricated by 
conventional injection-casting into a copper mold under an argon atmosphere. The 
structure of as-cast rods was examined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Shimadzu 
XRD-6000) using Cu Kα1 radiation. Thermal properties were studied by a differential 
scanning calorimeter (DSC, PerkinElmer Diamond DSC) at a fixed heating rate 20 
oC/min under an argon flow. Microstructure was observed on cross-section of as-cast 
rods using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JOEL 2010F) operating at an 
accelerating potential of 200 kV. Structural identification of the phases was carried 
out by the conventional selected area electron diffraction (SAED). 
The a-Si1-xMnx:H thin films were deposited on Si(100) substrates at room 
temperature by magnetron co-sputtering in a mixed gas Ar/H2 = 80/20. The Mn 
concentration was fixed at an optimal content (x = 0.105) [36]. After deposition, the 
samples were annealed for 30 mins at 373, 473, 573, 673, and 773 K, respectively, 
under vacuum 10-6 Torr. The thickness of films was fixed at 500 nm. The structural 
properties were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (MAC Science, MXP18), 
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (JOEL 2010F) and extended x-ray 
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) by synchrotron radiation. The Mn K-edge EXAFS 
measurements were performed in fluorescence mode of detection at Beamline 17C of 
Taiwan Light Source (TLS) at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center 
(NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. An energy dispersive 13-element Ge detector was used 
to collect x-ray fluorescence photons from the samples. The Mn concentration of the 
films was detected by a field-emission electron-probe micro-analyzer (JEOL 
JXA-8500F). Furthermore, magnetic measurements were performed by a SQUID 
(superconducting quantum interference device, MPMS-XL7). Finally, we measured 
temperature (Trg) and γ-factor to be 31 K, 0.59, 0.403, respectively. Although the 
supercooled liquid region of Au50Sn6Cu26Si18 BMG is not higher than those in 
literature [20], Trg and γ-factor are promising. Besides, it is potential for good 
processing below 100 oC in hot water because of the low Tg and moderate ΔTx. 
Therefore, it is potential for use in many applications such as jewelry, dentistry, 
micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) and nano-imprint.

In addition, we successfully developed new BMG (Ca66.4Al33.6)100-xZnx alloys 
with x= 5 ~ 15. Figure 3(a) demonstrates a typical DTA curve of x= 5 BMG. It shows 
that Tg, Tx and Tl of (Ca66.4Al33.6)99.5Zn5 as-cast BMG rod 1 mm in diameter are 248 
oC, 269 oC and 556 oC, respectively. We also cast Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG, 2 mm in 
diameter, and plates 1 mm in thickness.

Magnetic properties 
Shown in Fig. 5a are typical M-H loops, at T = 10 K, of as-deposited and 
post-annealed (473 K/30 mins, 573 K/30 mins) a-Si0.895Mn0.105:H films. In M-H 
measurements, the annealed samples have a higher Ms than that of as-deposited one. 
After post-annealing treatment, Ms increases about 100% and 350%, hence we focus 
on post-annealed samples (573 K/30 mins) with optimal magnetic properties. Fig. 5b 
shows both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization versus 
temperature (M-T) curves of post-annealed sample (573 K/30 mins), from 350 K 
down to 10 K with or without an applied field of 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 T. The FC and ZFC 
curves are apart and FC does not go to zero up to 350 K, indicating that Tc is well 
above room temperature. In DMSs, the FC and ZFC curves begin to split at a 
temperature below Tc, and change monotonously with a further decrease. In magnetic 
nanoparticles, the FC and ZFC curves overlap only at high-temperature region and for 
the ZFC curve, a peak at a “blocking” temperature could be observed, which was 
caused by the competition between the thermal energy and the magnetic anisotropy 
energy from the nanoparticles. In Fig. 5b, there is no peak observed in the ZFC curve, 
which is reasonably smooth. The magnetization increases as increasing temperature 
due to the disorder, such as spin glass. Therefore, it is believed that no magnetic 
nanoparticles exited in the samples and the room-temperature ferromagnetism is 
caused by the incorporation of Mn into silicon. On the other hand, the behavior in the 
FC curves is quite different. The 0.1 T field-cooled curve drops rapidly from 10 K 
until 50 K, and leveling all the way to 350 K. But the 0.3 and 0.6 T field-cooled 
curves look like convex.

Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure analysis 
The conventional magnetic measurements are unable to distinguish an intrinsic 
signal from extrinsic ones and just add up all contributions from all ferromagnetic 
sources. Moreover, the doped magnetic atoms generally do not possess any 
long-range structural order. Thus, X-ray or neutron diffraction is not helpful to reveal 
spatial distribution of magnetic ions in the host semiconductor. The short-range-order 
method of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is uniquely suitable 
for this purpose [40,41]. We used the EXAFS technique to investigate the local 
structures surrounding magnetic Mn atoms in a-Si1-xMnx:H samples. 
To probe the local environment surrounding the dopant atoms, Mn K-edge 
EXAFS was used. An established data reduction program was used to extract the 
EXAFS χ functions from the raw experimental data [42]. Local structural parameters 
were quantitatively extracted from the χ functions using an improved curve-fitting 
procedure [41]. A detailed description of the EXAFS experiments and analysis on 
Conclusions 
The new quaternary based on cost-effective Au50Sn6Cu26Si18 BMG alloy with 
gold content 18 karats was developed in this research. It retains good glass-forming 
baility to form the BMG rod at least 1 mm in diameter. This Au-based BMG shows 
low glass transition temperature (82 oC), crystallization temperature (113 oC), liquidus 
temperature (330 oC) and moderate ΔTx (31 oC). Hence the Au-Sn-Cu-Si BMG 
possesses the expected processing ability and is potential for many applications such 
as jewelry, dentistry and micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) in the future. 
Furthermore, the (Ca66.4Al33.6)100-xZnx (x = 5 ~ 15) and Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMGs were 
obtained successfully. Ca-based BMGs are highly passivated in alkaline solution, 
such as 11 M KOH (pH 14). This makes them very potential in future application. We 
are continuing the exploration of Ca-based BMG for green energy generation.  
Structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of a-Si1-xMnx:H with and without 
post-annealing have been investigated. After annealing, saturation magnetization, 
conductivity and carrier concentration increase by 400%, one order and 350%, 
respectively. Moreover, the EXAFS experimental results have indicated that annealed 
a-Si1-xMnx:H thin films nearly free of Mn clusters and oxides. As results, we 
successfully made use of post-annealing to enhance electrical and magnetic properties 
of a-Si1-xMnx:H films. The reason is arising from the fact that thermal energy of 
annealing activates hydrogen diffusion, which results in a more homogeneous 
hydrogen distribution and reduces defect density. Moreover, anomalous Hall effect 
reproducibly observed at T = 25 ~ 300 K suggests that the origin of the 
ferromagnetism arises from hole-mediated mechanism and may directly lead to the 
possible realization of Si-based spintronics devices operative at room temperature, 
such as field-effect transistors devices.
