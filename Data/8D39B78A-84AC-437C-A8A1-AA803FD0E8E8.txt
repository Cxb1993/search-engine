4Abstract
This project entitled “On the study of nonlinear mechanism for wave
propagation over muddy bottom” is a three-year study from August 2008 to July
2011. The main objective is to theoretically and experimentally examine the damping
effects as waves propagate over a muddy bottom. Based on the linear analysis in the
first year and the results of soliton-mud interaction in the second year, the analysis of
dissipated and transferred energy in this system was examined in the final year.
Moreover, a window-based interface was also established for the sake of calculating
all wave properties more efficiently and accurately. In brief, results and conclusions
of present project are expected to provide useful information for future studies.

6other hand, the Voigt model is good for simulating creep but rather poor at predicting stress
relaxation. Therefore, a more general model is expected to improve this weakness. In a viewpoint
of theoretical analysis, a too complicated model should be avoided because of only a few of
advantages (for example, accuracy) compared with lengthy calculation. To this end, the Oldroyd-B
model constituted by a single spring connected with a Voigt element in series is chosen to simulate
the mud motions. It covers all characteristics of the Voigt and Maxwell models and will predict
both stress relaxation and creep very well.

2. Experimental results (實驗結果)
Experiment set-up
The experiments were conducted in a 25 m glass-wall flume with a width 0.3m, as shown in
Fig.3. The flume is equipped a piston-type wave maker to generate monochromatic waves. A false
bottom covered by acrylic panels is set up in the flume to create a submarine trench. The trench has
the same spanwise width (in the cross flume section), i.e., B=0.3m, a streamwise length of w=1.08
m, and a vertical height as d=0.15m. A 1/20 slope was located at the leading edge of false bottom to
reduce wave transformation of incident wave. On the other hand, another 1/20 slope at the end with
artificial porous structures to absorb wave energy and minimize the reflecting effects is equipped.
For all experimental conditions, the coefficients of reflection are less than 5%. Water surface
elevations were measured by eight capacitance-type wave gages with the sampling rates of 50Hz.
First gage is used to examine desired wave condition and be the initial condition. Four gauges were
set above the submarine trench to check wave transformation. Finally, the wave transmission was
investigated by three gauges. The still water depth, h, was kept constant as 0.15m throughout the
experiments while the incident wave heights were ranged from 2.85 cm to 4.99 cm. For each
different density and thickness of dense fluid, regular waves were generated from the periods of

visualize the density-stratified interface, an array of three spotlights was set behind the trench. In
order to obtain more detailed and higher spatial resolution on the 3 Copyright © 2009 by ASME
dynamic response of the internal wave, the FOV (field of view) focus on the right half side of the
trench with a width of 0.5 m. A mesh grid was used to calculate the amplification factor, which
translates the image pixels to real length scale, 19. 65 pixel/cm.

Wave gages are typical instrument for measuring the water surface elevation at one single fixed
point. However, interfacial wave exists within two different density layers, which cannot give a
linear response to capacitance-type wave gage. Furthermore, contacting instruments induce mixing
effect and generate small ripples, then enhance the process of diffusion and erosion locally. In order
to avoid the undesired effects, we use a digital camera as a non-intrusive instrument to record the
interfacial wave and surface wave at the same time. The techniques for detecting water surface and
interface are described in this paragraph. Recordings of interfacial waves are characterized by two
regions: a dark region representing the sugar-water layer, and a bright foreground representing the
fresh water. However, there are some regions which we are not interested, like background and
lightings. Fig.5(a). shows an example of recording obtainable with a light source and digital camera.
The frequency of finding a pixel with a given intensity (or luminosity) is usually used to
characterize photos such as the one in Fig.5(a). Although the intensity histogram of the whole
image is not uniform, we still can distinguish the desired interfacial wave from their properties. We

Results
The dynamic pressure from surface waves propagating past the trench induces a flow in the
trench that displaces the dense fluid and, through the action of buoyancy forces, generates internal
waves that propagate back-and forth between the walls of the trench. When the frequency of the
propagating surface waves corresponds to the natural frequency of the internal motions in the trench,
the interfacial waves can attain large amplitudes relative to the surfaces, due to the comparatively
small potential energy involved in a given deformation of the density interface. Thus, for particular
trench geometry relative to the characteristic length scale of surface waves, the density-stratified
fluid within the channel may be excited into a mode of resonant oscillation.
However, it is difficult to catch the resonant oscillation because of no amplitude ratio bigger than
one for all wave conditions. Two distinct classes of internal waves were observed, namely, traveling
internal waves usually happened when the density of lower fluid was high, and standing internal
waves usually occurred when the density of lower fluid was low, as shown in Fig.8(a) and 8(b).
Traveling internal wave is a small and random wave. The propagating wave seems to have no
appreciable interaction with the heavier fluid. The non-resonant interfacial oscillations in the trench
are due to the pressure force exerted by the surface waves on the density interface that displaces the
heavier fluid and brings buoyancy effects into action. The small-amplitude motion was produced by
the restoring force as a result of the displacement of the interface.

Fig.10 Response curves for internal waves for different conditions
An important aspect of the interaction of surface waves with a density-stratified fluid in a
submerged trench is the resonant oscillations of internal waves in the trench. However, not all wave
conditions can induce a standing wave. In Figure 10, the internal wave height at the maximum
nodes of the trench, b, normalized by the wave height of the surface wave above the node, Hi, is
plotted as a function of kw., where k is the wave number of the surface wave in the constant-depth
above false bottom obtained using the linear inviscid theory; w is the width of the trench. For all
wave conditions, the excited responses are observed when the incoming wave is limited within in a
particular frequency. However, we cannot find the trend for most dense and thick fluid due to the
ability of wave generator. This can be improved by changing the width of trench in the future.
It is also important to note that the response curve of Fig.10 results in an efficient filter for
frequencies away from resonance, so that the high-frequency components in the surface waves
contribute very little to the motion of the internal waves. Thus, the non-symmetrical waveforms
observed in the internal wave record are due to truly nonlinear behavior in the internal wave
motions. In our investigation, two conditions easily induced large oscillations. One is the dense
layer with a thickness of 8 cm and density of 1.05 g/cm3. The other is the dense layer with a
thickness of 4 cm and density of 1.20 g/cm3.
3. Conclusions (結論)
Conclusions from theoretical analysis
The most important property we have to understand is the mud rheology. Past studies often used
the Voigt model or the Maxwell model to simulate the mud motion. Though it is simple to calculate
for theoretical analysis, however, some important properties cannot be exactly revealed. Herein we
try to introduce a more general model, the Oldroyd-B model, which includes most models as special
cases, to study the mud rheology. Linear analysis is carried out and the motion of interface and

The Second-Year Study
98年度計畫成果 (2/3)
In the second year of this three-year project, a nonlinear study was performed by observing a
solitary wave over the mud at the laboratory. The numerical analysis was also carried out by
establishing a window-base interface for easily calculating the wave properties.
1. Interaction of solitary waves and a muddy bottom (孤立波與泥質底床互制研究)
A short review
In general, it is quite difficult to perform a theoretical study on nonlinear wave-mud interaction
due to the complexity of mud rheology. In comparison with numerous studies on linear waves,
nonlinear studies were revealed in very few reports. Jiang and Zhao (1989) performed both
theoretical and experimental studies on solitary waves propagating over a muddy bottom. Later,
Jiang et al. (1990) examined the case of Cnoidal waves. Recently, Ng (2004) and Ng and Zhang
(2007) theoretically examined the mass transport due to wave-mud interactions.
Theoretical background for soliton-mud interaction
Several papers have focused on nonlinear analyses of wave-mud interaction, but it is still unclear
in the viewpoint of theoretical study. There are two reasons which can account for the difficulty
toward an accurately theoretical study. The first difficulty is how to simulate the rheology under
wave-mud interaction. A rheology model usually combines a spring and damper elements to
simulate the mud motion for its elasticity and viscosity. Such a model works well for a linear
analysis, but results in a very difficult task for nonlinear analysis. Secondly, a solitary wave, which
may be the most classical nonlinear wave, is a highly unstable wave. Namely, the wave form of
soliton can be easily destroyed by a small disturbance. The muddy bottom which greatly reduces
the wave energy is obviously a “huge” disturbance. Furthermore, experimental results (see details
in next sub-section) also show the highly instable characteristic that a solitary wave cannot remain
its original form due to the mud effects. Hence, some existing theories cannot capture the real
properties of soliton-mud interactions.
Though the difficulties of deriving an accurate solution for soliton-mud interaction have been
elucidated in previous sub-section, ideas demonstrated in past studies may be helpful to us for the
nonlinear analysis and will be briefly introduced herein. Jiang and Zhao (1989) calculated the
viscous damping of soliton-mud interaction by using the boundary-layer analysis on all interfaces.
They assumed that three boundaries are thin enough to validate the Prandtl’s boundary layer
equations. The first approximations were derived for the velocities in the irrotational cores and
three boundary layers, as well as the attenuation coefficients of wave heights. An obvious error of

Next, the mud is “poured” into the trench to form a layer of 6-cm thickness.
Fig.13 Mud in the trench
For understanding the effects from the mud density and the height of solitons, we carried out a
series of test for different conditions. Results from wave gauges show that the initial single solitary
wave will gradually split into several solitons depending on the initial wave height. A larger wave
height will cause more split solitons after the wave meets a muddy bottom. Detailed data measured
by wave gauges are shown in the following figures respectively for the initial wave height H = 3, 5,
and 8 cm.
20
Fig.16 Measured data for mud density = 1.45 g/cm3 and H = 8cm
From above results, it is found that there are three split solitons for the case of H = 8 cm and two
split solitons for the case of H = 5 cm. It implies that a higher initial wave height can generate more
split solitons. The reason accounting for this phenomenon may be the highly unstable property of
solitons. Namely, a larger initial wave height which possess more nonlinear tendency will be more
unstable than a small one.
2. Numerical analysis and a window-base interface (數值分析及視窗介面建構)
Establishing a window-base interface is great helpful to calculate the wave damping as well as
velocity profiles in a short time. In general, the complexity and nonlinearity are common features
for all fluid-mud model equations. Herein the viscous model proposed by Dalrymple and Liu in
1978 was adopted for coding a Matlab program. For their model, ten equations are required to
connect the relations between ten unknowns. Equations for solving numerically are firstly
introduced and listed below:

several solitons due to the resistance of the mud. A larger initial wave height will result in a more
number of split solitons. Due to a highly unstable characteristic of solitary waves, the genuine
reason responsible for this phenomenon could be clearer after more careful and further
investigations are carried out next year.
Another achievement of this year is the construction of a window-base interface for rapidly
calculating the damping rate of a viscous fluid-mud model. In general, the complexity and
nonlinearity are common features for all fluid-mud model equations. For a two-layer viscous
fluid-mud model, ten equations are required to connect the relations between ten unknowns. We
successfully solve this 10x10 matrix numerically and then show all solutions in a window-base
interface. By using this interface, it can not only greatly shorten the calculation time, but also can be
much easier performed by those unfamiliar with fluid-mud interaction.

Eq.(42) shows the potential energy under wave-mud interaction. We can recognize that the first
term on the right hand side of Eq.(42) is the original definition of potential energy in water. The
second term is an additional term due to the present of mud, and it depends on the differential
density and square of interfacial amplitude. When wm  = , Eq. (6) reduces to the potential energy
in one-layer system.
2. Experimental setup (實驗布置與條件)
This series of experiments has the same set-up as that for nonlinear waves, as shown in Fig.11.
Herein only the mud and wave conditions are demonstrated. To examine the geometry effects on
damping, all test conditions were recorded under a no-mud setup as a reference. All conditions
were shown in Table 1. Monotonic waves were generated to test different wave heights, frequencies
and densities. The wavelength slightly changes with mud densities because effective water depth
varies with mud density. The ratio of wavelength (based on ρm=1420 kg/m3) to the length of trench
(877 cm) ranges from 2.67 to 15.68. As a result, the propagation length of surface wave is at least
2.67 wavelengths. Mud layer thickness was kept at 6 cm and water depth was fixed at 24 cm,
respectively. The measured period was 10 minutes. Mineral components and rheological properties
of our selected sediment (kaolinite) were tested before the experiment.
Table 1. Test Conditions: T= wave period, H= initial wave height, L=wave length, d=mud layer
thickness. The water depth was kept at 30 cm for all cases. Each case will be tested for different
mud densities of 1200, 1310 and 1420 kg/m3 under the condition d=6 cm.

4. Profiles of surface and interfacial waves
Based on above result and no wave breaking is observed, surface energy dissipation can be
contributed by two components: mud motion and shear stress done by viscous fluid mud. It is
possible to quantify how mud energy was taken from surface wave to induce mud motion.
Therefore, we utilize Eq.(42) to examine the potential energy in two layers and compare their
differences. One area of particular interest in this study is that there are three modes of mud motion,
i.e. the external, internal and combination modes. The first behaves as the same frequency and
28
that displaces the heavier fluid and brings buoyancy effects into action. The second is the shear
stress working on the interface. The dynamic pressure is proportional to surface wave height while
the shear stress is proportional to surface wave period in the fixed water depth. To investigate the
effect of pressure and shear stress on the fluid mud motion, the amplitude ratio of interfacial wave
to surface wave, captured by CCD cameras, was plotted in Fig. 10 together with wave steepness.
Figure 24a-c shows the amplitude ratio in different densities all decline with wave steepness. There
are several reasons for illustrating this phenomenon. Large wave steepness is relatively short wave
when wave height is fixed. Therefore, the velocity around water-mud interface is smaller than long
wave. Consequently, the applied force on mud layer is relatively small and lead to small motion.
On the other side, small wave steepness tends to have large shear force and pushes the fluid mud
more violent. Moreover, the results show that there is a clear separation among different initial
wave heights. The dynamic pressure induced by the potential elevation is proportional to the wave
height, and hence big wave height results in big interfacial amplitude. Finally, mud densities also
play an important role on this ratio, which is noted that the motion of heavier mud is smaller than
dilute cases. Figure 24d indicates another parameter, relative water depth, which is significant to
fluid mud motion. The ratios range from 0.017 at deep water waves to 0.182 at shallow water
waves. A power-law least-square is found to fit the data well. The water depth may be a suitable
parameter to predict amplitude ratio of wave-mud interaction only when the external mode is
excited. According to the terms on the right hand side of Eq.(42), we can calculate the ratio of the
second term to the first term, which represents potential energy taken from mud motion against
potential energy without fluid mud, as shown in Fig.25. This ratio depends on the square of
amplitude ratio and differential density. The potential energy transferring from surface to the mud
motion ranges from 0.003 % to 0.94 % during each wave cycle. For deep water wave, the fluid mud
motion can be treated as solid bottom because of little energy was transferred. However, fluid mud
motion can take nearly 1 % of energy form free surface once the mud motion is excited in the
shallow water. It is noted that this value may accumulate with propagation distance, and becomes
notable only after several wavelengths.

Important conclusions and findings which have been well demonstrated in previous sections are
neglected. In this section we provide some topics and suggestions for future studies.
1. The velocity profiles in mud layer: The lowest layer which we can measure the velocity is the
point 2 cm away from the rigid bottom. This may be good for most tests. However, this
limitation should be overcome if one hopes to understand the exact velocity near the bottom.
This is an important point to check the no-slip condition assumed at the rigid bottom. Though it
is clear that there exists a jump near the bottom from the experimental data, we still need to
develop the new technique or method to measure the exact velocity profile through the mud
layer, specially that close to the bottom.
2. Mild-slope effects: As well-known, the continental shelf is usually assumed to be horizontal in
theoretical studies and experimental setup. However, mild-slope effects may not be ignored
when investigating the real applications. This topic may become the most important one in the
future.
3. Choices of rheological models: The most popular models for wave-mud interaction are the
Voigt and Maxwell models. Though applying these two models are comparatively easier than
using other models for calculation, some fluid properties may be not well described by these
simple models. Besides, various muddy materials with rheological properties result in the
difficulty of choosing a suitable model. Therefore studies of other complex models and
comparison between models and properties of in-situ muds are required in the future.
4. More nonlinear cases: The nonlinear analysis for rheological models is generally hard due to
the complexity of rheological parameters. This may result in that the corresponding experiments
are comparatively few. Though the interaction between solitary waves and a muddy bottom is
experimentally examined, more other nonlinear waves and random waves passing over a mud
layer are the next possible and valuable topic for all researchers.

Propagation of water waves over a muddy bottom is experimentally examined in this study. In general, the muddy material plays a
significant role in attenuating the wave energy. Though this attenuation has been calculated and observed by theoretical analysis,
numerical studies and field observations, the related experiments, however, are still few and only limited physical properties are measured.
To this end, more characteristics of wave and mud which include wave attenuation, amplitude of fluid-mud interface, particle velocities in
the water column, concentration distribution and rheological properties are measured in our experiments.   According to the experimental
results, it is found that the damping coefficient depends mainly on the wave amplitude, wavelength and mud density. Since most of
analytical models based on the linear wave theory cannot describe the real characteristics of wave and mud, a new approach is adopted to
improve the accuracy in comparison with experimental measurement. Herein we introduce a non-dimensional wave energy parameter,
which is obtained from the Buckingham  theory, into the theoretical analysis. This improvement can obviously increase the accuracy of
the derived damping coefficient over that using only the linear theory.
Keywords: cohesive sediment, wave height attenuation, rheology, muddy bottom
1.   Introduction
Muddy bottom commonly exists in coastal regions. There are very complex interactions between wave and mud.
One of the most interesting topics is wave damping. Gade (1958) indicates that there is a shelter from storms in the Gulf
of Mexico, where the attenuation of wave caused by muddy bottom is great. Silvester (1974) describes that
cconsiderable attenuation of wave height occurs during only several wavelengths propagations.
From previous literatures, the damping mechanism depends on a lot of parameters, including wave period, wave
height, water depth, concentration distribution, the consolidated level, mud layer thickness and material components.
Especially, the rheology properties are most important one due to energy can only be damped by viscous fluid. In the
decades, there are numerous researches devote to study wave damping caused by bottom effect. Verreet and Berlamont
(1987) reviewed the rheology and non-Newtonian behavior of sea and estuarine mud. Due to the complex theological properties of
mud, among those reviewed studies, it has been treated as  elastic solid,  Bingham-plastic, viscous fluid, viscous-elastic solid or the
Voigt model, pore-elastic bed, visco-elastic-plastic bed and non-Newtonian power-law model. Each apprach can predic damping
effect through its characteristics on mud motion. For example, Darlymple and Liu (1979) adopted the linearized
NavierStokes equations to model the small amplitude wave train propagating in two layers of fluids with different
density and viscosity. The effects of the mud layer are studied in terms of the wave height attenuation rate and the phase
shift in the wave form. The damping coefficient (ki) was defined as:
xkieHH 0   [1]
where,
H is local wave height, H0 is initial wave height and x is the distance between two positions.
From their results, damping coefficient mainly changes with frequency and viscosity. A peak damping occurred when
viscous boundary layer thickness has same order of mud layer thickness. For short wave, small boundary layer thickness
and relatively deep water wave leads to low energy dissipation. As wave frequency decreases, growing boundary layer
thickness damps more energy than high frequency wave. Furthermore, the phase difference between pressure and
vertical velocity dominates the efficiency of work done by mud.
Liu and Chan (2007) investigates effects of thin visco-elastic mud layer on wave propagation, and compare with
available experimental data. All these models can predict damping effect well. However, few experiments were
conducted to isolate numerous parameters and test their relationships. Maa (1986) used visco-elastic model to predict
the erosion rate under wave. They conducted a series of tests with different periods of consolidation. The damping
mechanisms of soft mud were not completely discussed and the effects of different wave heights on damping were not
mentioned. Sakakiyama (1989) conducted an experiment with homogeneous density distribution to discuss damping

decrease in wave height is observed in our experiment. Fig. 4 shows the non-dimensional wave height decay with
propagation wave length. The orriginal x was shifteed to starting point of muddy bottom and divied by wavelength.
Local wave heights were normalized by initial wave height. For low density=1200 kg/m3, there is a 15 % damping in
wave height after four and half wavelengths propagation, as shown in Fig. 4a. For high density=1420 kg/m3, attenuation
can reach 40 %  after only three wavelengths propogation. It is noted that the wave heights decay linearly along the
trench, instead of exponentially. However, if we apply exponential decay to experimental data, there is no big difference
with linear fitting. This is because exponentailly decay can describe zero attenuation when wave height is very small.
Small wave height can not overcome yield stress, and therefore there is no damping. Nevertheless, attenuation always
occured even though test condition is short period, small wave and low density (H=2 cm, T=0.6 sec, density=1200
kg/m3). Based on above observation, we select the slope of linear fitting curve as damping coefficient. Therefore, Eq. [1]
changes to
2121 /)/ln( xxHHki   [2]
where,
H1 and H2 is any two points on fitting curve and x1 and x2 are their positions.In order to examine energy dissipation caused by different parameters, we modify the original damping coefficient
by introducing initial energy ratio and one wavelength propogation, as shown in Eq. (3)
L
h
Hkk ii 20 )(mod                 [3]
where,
H0 is initial wave heighth, h is water depth and L is wavelength. kimod is nondimensional damping coefficient.
Equation (3) contains three parts, damping coefficient, initial energy ration and wavelength. The equation presents the
damping rate of initial energy, which propogate over per unit wavelength. Fig. 5 shows the relations between energy
damping rate and wave steepness at different mud densities. These figures demonstrate the experimental data accurately
predicts the variation with wave steepness, and the effects of wave height, wavelength and densities.
Fig. 5a-c shows that damping rate declines with wave steepness. There are several reasons for illustrating this
phenomenon. High wave steepness is relatively short wave when wave height is fixed. Therefore, Sotkess boundary
layer thickness is small and which leads to littele energy dissipation. When wave steepness become small at fixed wave
height, thick boundary thickness dominete whole miud laye and results in big energy dissipation. When wavesteepness
is high at fixed wave length, the wave is relatively at deep water depth. As a result, wave propogagation is not
significantly effected by bottom. On the other side, at shallow watetr wave the bottom effect becomes important.
 For the wave height effects, the results clearely indicate that bigh wave height lost more energy than small wave
height. If traditional viscous model is applied, different wave heights have the same damping  coefficient because of
linear governing equation is used. The results here provide sufficient evidence to point out the importance of wave
height effect. Comparing with different densities, high density also damps more energy than low density. The main
corresponding reason is viscosity increase quickly with densities.
4.    Conclusions
This experiment  investigate the effects of different wave heights, periods and mud densities on energy dissipation.
The standard kaolin was used to create an ideal two layer system. The homogeneous density may be different with field.
However, the uniform density is easy to fix several parameters and matches most theoretical assumptions. The rheology
analysis shows that fluid mud behaves like Bingham fluid when density smaller than 1300 kg/m3 and performs like
non-linear behavior when densities are higher. The viscosity increases with mud density and decreases with shear rate.
Peak value can reach 2000 times bigger than viscosity of water, which corresponds to significant energy dissipation.
The constant wave heights during measurement prove that damping rate does not vary with time. Therefore, using slope
of regression line is sufficient to describe damping rate.  Energy dissipation mainly depends on wave length, wave
height, and density. Furthermore, the wave steepness is also important to damping. To examine energy dissipation
caused by different parameters, we modify the original damping coefficient by introducing initial energy ratio and one
wavelength propogation. New formula can examine the effects of wave heights, periods and mud densities on energy
dissipation. Especially, the importance of wave height is proved in the experiment. For detailed analysis on velocity
profile in the water column will be further stuided.
