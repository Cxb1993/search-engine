1.2 Abstract 
This study proposes mixed traffic cell transmission models (MCTM) to replicate the behaviors of mixed 
traffic consisted of cars and motorcycles. Both types of vehicles exhibit rather different traffic behaviors in 
competing roadway capacity and remaining storage space. Thus, MCTM should be dynamically adjusted and 
allocated between cars and motorcycles according to mixture ratio of vehicles types and the traffic phases – 
free flow, synchronized, and congested. Based on our field observations, two MCTM models are developed. 
The first MCTM model uses the ratio of car to motorcycle in the last upstream cell to determine the amount of 
roadway resources allocated to cars, and vice versa for motorcycles. The second MCTM model further 
incorporates an entropy index to adjust the traffic speed. To validate the proposed MCTM models, videotaping 
traffic data in Taipei city covering a full traffic spectrum from free-flow to congested are collected. The results 
show that the both proposed MCTM models can accurately simulate the traffic flows under various traffic 
phases and mixture ratios with an average MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) below 30%. 
Based on the proposed MCTM model, this study proposes a stepwise genetic fuzzy logic controller 
(SGFLC) to learn both logic rules and membership functions. At each learning process, the proposed 
algorithm selects one logic rule which can best contribute to the overall performance controlled by previously 
selected logic rules combined with this selected rule. Such a selection procedure will be repeated until no 
other rule can ever improve the control performance. Therefore, the incumbent combination of logic rules is 
the near optimal learning results. This study considers traffic flows and queue lengths of cars and motorcycles 
as the state variables and extension of green time as the control variable, towards the minimization of total 
vehicle delays. To investigate the control performance of the proposed SGFLC model, comparisons of two 
pre-timed timing plans and three adaptive signal timing models are conducted at an isolated intersection. 
Results show our proposed SGFLC model performs the best. Moreover, as traffic flows vary more noticeably, 
the SGFLC model performs even better than any other models.

(CTM), proposed by Daganzo (1994, 1995), to evaluate the performance of learned logic rules and tuned 
membership function. Besides, the conventional CTM was designed for pure traffic. Incorporation of more 
realistic CTM rules into the simulation of mixed traffic (various types of vehicles such as cars and 
motorcycles) on urban streets is comparatively less addressed. Based on this, this study conducted mixed 
traffic cell transmission models (MCTM), proposed by Chiou and Hsieh (2011), to replicate the behaviors of 
mixed traffic consisted of cars and motorcycles. The MCTM model uses the ratio of car to motorcycle in the 
last upstream cell to determine the amount of roadway resources (i.e. max flow capacity and storage capacity) 
allocated to cars, and vice versa for motorcycles. In order to describe the relationship between cars and 
motorcycles more realistic. The MCTM model further incorporates an entropy index to adjust the traffic speed, 
since the interferences between two types of vehicles will be rapidly increased as the mixture ratio of cars and 
motorcycles becomes higher. 
 
Based on this, this paper aims to develop an adaptive signal control model for both isolated and sequential 
intersections based on the proposed stepwise genetic fuzzy logic controller (SGFLC) with a mixed traffic cell 
transmission modeling (MCTM) approach. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefs the rationales 
for signal control with a SGFLC model and MCTM model. Section 3 presents the validation of the MCTM 
model in replicating real traffic hydrodynamic behaviors. Section 4 utilizes experimental cases to validate the 
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SGFLC model in controlling the signal at an isolated intersection. 
Section 5 further validates the effectiveness of the SGFLC model in controlling the signal of arterial 
coordinated sequential intersections. Finally, the concluding remarks and suggestions for future research 
follow. 
 
2. THE RATIONALES 
 
2.1. The stepwise GFLC model 
 
The encoding methods, genetic operators and stepwise evolution algorithm for the stepwise GFLC model are 
briefly described as follows. 
 
(1) Encoding logic rules and membership functions 
Consider a triangle fuzzy number and let parameters c
r
, c
c
 and c
l
 respectively represent the coordinates of 
right anchor, cortex and left anchor of a linguistic degree as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, a variable with a 
linguistic degree has 3 parameters need to be calibrated with an order of: 
 
rcl ccc                 (1) 
 
To avoid the violation of the abovementioned order of these three parameters, three 3 position variables r1~r3 
are designed as follows: 
 
1rc
l                  (2) 
21 rrc
c                 (3) 
321 rrrc
r                (4) 
 
To achieve two significant digits, each position variable is represented by four real-coding genes also depicted 
in Figure 1. The maximum value of the position variables is 99.99 and the minimum value is 0. Thus, in the 
example of two state variables and one control variable, the chromosome is composed of 36 genes. 
 
6 
 
selected. The selection process continues until the control performance cannot be improved by introducing 
any other rule. The stepwise learning algorithm is structured as follows: 
Step 0: Initialization: s=1. The rule combination set, SRs, is an empty set. 
Step 1: Update rule combination set. SRs= SRs-1+ Rs. 
Step 2: Tuning membership functions. 
Step 2-1: Generating an initial population with p chromosomes. Each chromosome representing a logic rule 
has 12(n+1) genes and each gene randomly takes one integer from [0, 9]. n is the number of state 
variables. 
Step 2-2: Calculating the fitness values of all chromosomes based on the logic rule representing by the 
chromosome and previously selected logic rules. 
Step 2-3: Selection. 
Step 2-4: Crossover. 
Step 2-5: Mutation. 
Step 2-6: Testing the stop condition. Let Rs be the chromosome with largest fitness of fs among the 
population for the s
th
 evolution epoch. The stop condition is set based on whether the mature rate 
has reached a given constant η. If so, proceed to Step 3 and let s=s+1; otherwise go to Step 2-3. 
Step 3: Testing the stop condition. If (fs - fs-1)≦ε, where ε is an arbitrary small number, then stops. Incumbent 
rule combination set, SRs, is the optimal learning results. Otherwise, go to Step 1. 
 
2.2. The signal control 
 
(1) Fitness value 
The performances of signal control for an isolated intersection or sequential intersections are commonly 
measured in terms of total number of stopped vehicles, proportion of stopped vehicles, average vehicle delays, 
total vehicle delays, maximal green band, etc. This paper sets the total vehicle delays (TVD) as the control 
performance index and thus defines the fitness function of GAs as: 
TVD
f
1
                (11) 
 
(2) State variables 
Following most of the previous literature, for the case of an isolated intersection, we choose traffic flow in 
green phase (TF) and queue length in red phase (QL) as two state variables and extension of green time (EGT) 
as the control variable. For the case of sequential intersections, TF is the summation of traffic flows at all 
approaches in green phase; while QL is the summation of queen length at all approaches in red phase. 
To reflect the different details of mixed traffic flow, three models with different considerations of state 
variables are developed. Model 1 considers four state variables: traffic flow of cars (TFC), traffic flow of 
motorcycles (TFM), queue length of cars (QLC) and queue length of motorcycles (QLM). Model 2 considers 
two state variables by weighted summing up cars and motorcycle traffic: traffic flow TFP (TFP = TFC + 
αTFM) and queue length QLP (QLP = QLC + αQLM), where α is the PCE of motorcycles (0.3 in this study). 
Model 3 also considers two state variables by simply summing up car and motorcycle traffic: traffic flow TFV 
(TFV = TFC + TFM) and queue length QLV (QLV = QLC + QLM). 
 
(3) Activation points 
In consideration of pedestrian safe crossing, a minimum green time (Gmin) in each green phase is preset both 
for an isolated intersection or sequential intersections. At the end of Gmin, the proposed stepwise GFLC model 
is activated automatically to conclude an EGT. If EGT ≥ EGTmin (a preset value), current green phase is 
extended by EGT seconds. If EGT < EGTmin, current green phase is then terminated. The SGFLC model will 
not be activated again until the end of this extension time. If total green time exceeds the preset maximum 
green time (Gmax), current green phase is forced to terminate. A short all-red (AR) period is designed in each 
signal change interval. The activation points for an isolated intersection are also depicted in Figure 2(a). 
 
This paper also uses of the SGFLC model to adaptively control the signals of sequential intersections along an 
arterial. To reflect the various traffic conditions of different coordinated intersections, the green times along

3.1. The mixed traffic cell-transmission model (MCTM) 
 
To facilitate the learning process of the proposed SGFLC model, an efficient traffic simulator is imperial to 
evaluate the performance of selected logic rules and tuned membership functions in a short period. Based on 
this, a cell-based traffic simulator, CTM, is considered. CTM, proposed by Daganzo (1994; 1995) for 
simulating traffic hydrodynamic behavior, uses several simple equations to govern traffic movements along 
the roadway which is represented by a series of equal-length cells. These equations are expressed as follows:

Based on the pure traffic CTM, Chiou and Hsieh (2011) developed and validated a mixed traffic CTM 
(MCTM) for the traffic flow of cars and motorcycles. In Chiou and Hsieh’s model, the variable )(tni  is 
decomposed into )(tnci  and )(tn
m
i  for representing the numbers of cars and motorcycles in cell i at time t, 
respectively. Thus, Eq. (12) can be revised as:

Both types of vehicles exhibit rather different traffic behaviors in competing roadway capacity and remaining 
storage space. Thus, the parameters of the MCTM, including maximal flow rate, maximal storage capacity, 
and remaining storage capacity, should be dynamically adjusted and allocated between cars and motorcycles 
according to mixture ratio of vehicles types. Depending upon various traffic conditions, three situations are 
detailed below: 
 
(1) Free flow condition: No competition between cars and motorcycles 
The flow and density of cars and motorcycles, in upstream cell, are less than maximal flow and remaining 
capacity of downstream cell. This condition refers to the first condition of Eq.(13) which the vehicles can 
transmit from upstream to downstream without any deter. 
 
(2) Maximal flow ( )(tqmi ) competition between cars and motorcycles 
This situation occurs when numbers of cars and motorcycles in upstream cell exceed maximal flow (i.e. the 
second condition of Eq.(13)). Thus, cars and motorcycles compete to transmit from upstream cell to 
downstream cell. This competition behavior can be elaborated as follows:

According to our field observations, the interferences between cars and motorcycles are rapidly increased as

3.2. Validation 
 
To validate the MCTM in replicating the traffic behaviors at signalized intersections in Taiwan, field traffic 
data were collected at one of approaches of a signalized intersection in Taipei on February 27, 2009. The 
study approach was divided into six cells depending on free flow speed and length of time step, as shown in 
Figure 3. The traffic moves from cell 1 to cell 6 and yI and yO denotes the traffic flows in and out the study 
approach. The stop line of the intersection locates at the right bound of cell 6. The performance of the MCTM 
model is shown in Table 1. As noted from Table 1, the MAPE values are less than 30% in most of cells in both 
green and red time. In addition, the simulation results are more accurate at the cells closer to the stop line and 
for motorcycle traffic.

According to the number of vehicles and flow at cell 6 in red time and green time, this study also validates the 
queuing behavior in red phase and platoon dispersion in green phase. The results are shown in Figure 4(a) and

behaviors at the signalized intersection.

To validate the effectiveness, the control performance of the SGFLC model is compared with two pre-timed 
models: optimal single (OS) and optimal multiple (OM) and three adaptive models: iterative genetic fuzzy 
logic control (IGFLC) model, vanishing queue (VQ) and maximum queue (MQ). Where the OS timing plan is 
determined by total enumeration method to search for an optimal cycle length and green time during the study 
period. The OM timing plan comprises seven optimal single timing plans depends on traffic flow pattern as 
shown in Fig.4. Since the OM model designs the optimal signal timings for each of traffic flow rates, its 
control performance is optimal for the given traffic pattern. The IGFLC model proposed by Chiou and Lan

To further examine the robustness of the SGFLC model, we randomly vary the traffic flows by 10% to 50% as 
shown in Figure 9. Assume that timing plans of pre-timed models (i.e. the OS and OM) remain unchanged and 
the adaptive models follow the same rules learned from the original traffic patterns given in Figure 4. The 
results are summarized in Table 5. Note that the SGFLC model performs best among the pre-timed and 
adaptive models. Moreover, the SGFLC model can do much better than any other models as the traffic flows 
vary more conspicuously, indicating the robustness of the SGFLC model.

5.2. Model performance 
 
To validate the effectiveness, the control performance of the SGFLC model is compared with the IGFLC, VQ 
and MQ models. To avoid lengthy discussions, the learning results of SGFLC are not reported. The control 
performances of these control models are reported and compared in Table 6. Obviously, the performances 
under progressive coordinated system are significantly superior to other systems. The progressive SGFLC 
model performs best among these four models, follows by the progressive VQ model. The signal control 
models under alternate coordinated system perform relatively poor. Also notice that all the SGFLC models 
under various coordinated systems perform better than the IGFLC, VQ and the MQ models. The results show 
the effectiveness of the proposed SGFLC model in controlling the signal timings of sequential intersections.

5.3. Model application 
 
To further investigate the field applicability of our proposed SGFLC model, a case study on three consecutive 
intersections along Jin-Ma arterial intersecting with Chang-Mei Road, Chang-Xing Road and Dong-Gu Road 
in Changhua City, Taiwan has been conducted. Configuration and traffic flow of the three intersections are 
shown in Figures 12 and 13, respectively. The green times of current timing plans during the observed period 
are 40 seconds north-south and 75 seconds west-east at Jin-Ma/Chang-Mei intersection, 50 seconds 
north-south and 120 seconds west-east at Jin-Ma/Chang-Xing intersection, 50 seconds north-south and 125 
seconds west-east at Jin-Ma/Dong-Gu intersection. All-reds and change interval are 6 seconds for all 
18 
 
forward. 
 
As to the control performance, under different levels of details of state variable measurement, the proposed 
SGFLC model can perform better if more detailed levels of state variables are considered. In the other words, 
under mixed traffic conditions, vehicle detectors should be able to accurately detect both traffic flows and 
queue length of cars and motorcycles. The comparisons among various pre-timed and adaptive signal control 
models show that the control performance of the SGFLC model is almost the same as the OM model, which is 
considered as the optimal control under given traffic patterns and is superior to the adaptive models for both 
cases of an isolated intersection and coordinated intersections. Moreover, the SGFLC model can perform 
much better than any other models as the traffic flows vary more conspicuously, indicating the robustness of 
the SGFLC model. It should be mentioned that in comparing to the IGFLC model, our model has better 
performance but with much fewer selected rules and shorter evolution time, suggesting the proposed model is 
more efficient and robust. 
 
The proposed SGFLC model mainly relies on the traffic information including traffic flow and queue length 
of cars and motorcycles to adaptively control the signal. Through a proper installation of two sets of sensors 
near the intersections, both traffic flow and queue length can be obtained (e.g. Sun et al., 2011). However, for 
the intersections with only one set of sensors, queue length can still be estimated based on traffic flow theories, 
e.g. shockwave method proposed by Liu et al. (2009). Additionally, the inaccuracy of traffic information 
detected on urban streets is pretty common. How to conduct an optimal control based on such inaccurate and 
unreliable vehicle detectors is also an interesting topic deserves further attempt. Other directions for future 
study can be identified. Firstly, the proposed stepwise algorithm is to select rules sequentially. However, an 
early selected rule may not be necessary to be the one of rules in the optimal rule combination. More effective 
and efficient encoding methods in selecting the logic rules or tuning the membership functions or both 
deserve to be explored. Secondly, for sequential coordinated intersections, the control performance is 
measured by TVD in this paper. Other performance indices, such as maximum green band, minimum stopping 
rate, and maximum throughput, deserve to be adopted and examined. Moreover, in this study, only simple two 
phase signal control plan is considered. Multi-phase signal control plans with consideration of turning flows at 
intersections deserves to be developed. Additionally, prior to field installation, the control performances of the 
trained SGFLC model can be further examined by commonly-adopted traffic simulation software packages, 
such as AIMSUN, VISSIM, PARAMICS, and CORSIM through build-in API interfaces, to judge 
effectiveness of the proposed model. Last but not least, for simplicity, this study lumps cars and heavy 
vehicles all together and limits our application to signal coordination along a corridor. To further enhance the 
comprehensiveness of the proposed model, the mixed traffic with motorcycles, cars, and heavy vehicles 
(trucks and buses) and the signal control scaled up to the network level should be considered.

to identify associated factors. 
 
For crash severity modeling from an individual accident perspective, various methodological 
approaches have been applied, such as logistic regression (e.g., Sze and Wong, 2007; 
Al-Ghamdi, 2002), bivariate models (e.g., Yamamoto and Shankar, 2004; De Lapparent, 2008; 
Lee and Abdel-Aty, 2008), multinomial and nested logit structures to evaluate accident-injury 
severities (e.g., Shankar and Mannering, 1996; Chang and Mannering, 1999; Carson and 
Mannering, 2001; Lee and Mannering, 2002; Abdel-Aty, 2003; Ulfarsson and Mannering, 
2004; Holdridge et al., 2005; Savolainen and Mannering, 2007) and mixed logit models 
(Milton et al., 2008; Gkritza and Mannering, 2008; Pai et al., 2009). 
 
Notably, the discrete ordered probability model is one of the most common approaches used 
in recent accident severity studies (Shibata and Fukuda, 1994; O’Donnell and Connor, 1996; 
Duncan et al., 1998; Renski et al., 1999; Khattak, 2001; Kockelman and Kweon, 2002; 
Abdel-Aty, 2003; Zajac and Ivan, 2003; Abdel-Aty and Keller, 2005; Lee and Abdel-Aty, 
2005; Williams, 2006 ; Eluru and Bhat, 2007; Pai and Saleh, 2007; Eluru et al., 2008; Gray et 
al., 2008; Pai and Saleh, 2008; Wang and Abdel-Aty, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2008). This 
approach has considerable appeal because severity outcomes are discrete and ordered from 
low severity to high severity (e.g., property damage only, possible injury, evident injury, and 
disabling injury and fatality). The injury-severity categories are ordered in categories that are 
in some cases closely related (e.g., levels of no injury and possible injury); additionally, 
injury levels may be closely related (Savolainen et al., 2010). These crash severity studies 
have applied ordered response modeling to accommodate the natural order of crash severity 
levels. In the same vein, most of these studies applied the univariate ordered probit model to 
analyze two-vehicle accidents (e.g., Shibata and Fukuda, 1994; Shankar et al., 1996; Chang 
and Mannering, 1999; Carson and Mannering, 2001; Khattak, 2001; Kockelman and Kweon, 
2002; Lee and Mannering, 2002; Abdel-Aty, 2003; Abdel-Aty and Keller, 2005; Pai and 
Saleh, 2008). However, due to a restriction on the number of dependent variables—only one 
variable is allowed—those studies simply determined the severity level of two-vehicle 
accidents by adopting the crash severity level of party injured most. 
 
As mentioned, the injury severity levels of the two parties involved in the same accident may 
differ markedly. Undoubtedly, considering the severity levels of two parties along with the 
corresponding factors is necessary to obtain insights from crash data and to propose effective 
safety strategies. Only considering the most-injured party may result in loss of valuable 
information. Moreover, the severity levels of the two parties along with contributing factors 
cannot be modeling separately, as these factors are typically closely related, resulting from 
the interrelationships among potential risk factors such as driver behavior, vehicle type, and 
collision type. The interaction between risk aversion behaviors of both drivers may also affect 
resulting severity levels. Thus, the severity levels of the two parties along with the 
corresponding contributing factors cannot be modeling separately, as observed or unobserved 
factors are usually correlated to some degree. Neglecting these potential correlations may 
lead to over- or under-estimation of parameters in crash severity modeling, thereby 
generating endogeneity problems (Winston et al., 2006; De Lapparent, 2008; Savolainen et 
al., 2010). Providing a relatively more efficient estimation by considering common 
unobserved factors for all involved parties, such as passengers (Hutchinson, 1986; Yamamoto 
and Shankar, 2004) and other involved drivers (Rana, 2009), in the same accident. This study 
applies the bivariate generalized ordered probit (BGOP) model to model simultaneously 
crash severity of both parties without losing the important crash information of both parties. 
The BGOP model, a flexible and comprehensive analytical approach, can regress two ordered 
7 
 
normal distribution of random components, the joint probability of the two drivers involved 
in the same accident can be expressed as follows:

2.2 Bivariate Generalized Ordered Probit 
 
As mentioned, the BGOP model is based on the BOP (Yamamoto and Shankar, 2004) and the 
GORL models (Eluru et al., 2008). In Eqs. (1) and (2), thresholds uq1 and uq2 are now 
subscripted by index q to show that these cutoffs can vary across accidents involving 
different individuals to account for individual observed risk features.

In what follows, this study adopts a specific parametric function for each threshold to satisfy 
the following two ordering conditions: (   1,1,2,1,1,1,

(   2,2,1,2,

where Zq,k and Zq,l are two exogenous variable vectors. Each is linked to its associated 
thresholds

and 
,n,q

. Additionally, 
kq,   and ,q   are coefficients associated with crash 
vectors. 
 
Parameters αq,k and θq,l are included in each party’s specific injury severity level k (k=1, 2,…, 
K-1) and l (l=1, 2,…, L-1). In consideration of model identification, this study employs 
normalization, such that 1,1,
~
 lnqu  and 1,2,
~
 lnqu  equal zero for all q. Since the BGOP model 
is an extension of the BOP model, which restricts all non-constant parameters in the threshold 
function to zero. One can evaluate the validity of restrictions imposed by the restrictive BOP 
model using the likelihood ratio index (ρ2), model information criteria: Akaike information 
criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and chi-squared test. 
 
2.3 Model Estimation and Validation 
 
The log-likelihood of the BGOP model while considering both parties is given by: 
 
9 
 
first party is less than that of the second party (evident injury, 1006 vs. 553; disabling injury 
and fatality, 121 vs. 49), suggesting that the second party is more vulnerable to serious injury 
than the first party, and explaining the importance of simultaneously examining factors 
contributing to severity levels for different parties.

a female second party; this finding runs counter to our expectation. This may be because the 
driver overacts and this increases injury severity. 
 
The age variable (continuous form in the logarithmic term and discretized form for drivers 
aged >65) only affects the latent propensity of the first party, suggesting that when the first 
party is aged > 65, his/her injury severity in an accident increases. This finding is also 
consistent with that in other studies (Kockelman and Kweon, 2002; Zajac and Ivan, 2003; 
Abdel-Aty, 2003; Ulfarsson and Mannering, 2004; Yamamoto and Shankar, 2004; Eluru and 
Bhat, 2007; De Lapparent, 2008; Eluru et al., 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2008). Conversely, the 
ln(Age) parameter of the second party has a negative sign, implying that old drivers may have 
more experience than young drivers and respond to potential crashes better, thereby reducing 
the possible injury to the other party. 
 
The estimated parameters for violation type indicate that when the first driver is drunk, injury 
severity of the first and the second parties increases by 0.932 and 0.699, respectively. This 
analytical result is also in agreement with that in many previous studies (O’Donnell and 
Connor, 1996; Kockelman and Kweon, 2002; Zajac and Ivan, 2003; Abdel-Aty, 2003; 
Ulfarsson and Mannering, 2004; Yamamoto and Shankar, 2004; Holdridge et al., 2005; Eluru 
and Bhat, 2007; Eluru et al. ,2008; Wang and Abdel-Aty, 2008 ; Yamamoto et al., 2008), 
because alcohol adversely affects driver responses to risk by prolonging reaction time. 
However, if a drunk driver is the second party, only his/her injury severity increases, and has 
no significant effect on that of the first party. Surprisingly, negative effects of other behaviors 
that break traffic laws on injury severity of the second party are significant, implying that  
the second party breaking traffic laws may reduce his/her injury severity. This unexpected 
finding resembles that obtained by Abdel-Aty (2003). 
 
The effects of vehicle type on injury severity of the first or second party are also significant. 
Unlike previous studies of univariate model (Kockelman and Kweon, 2002; Zajac and Ivan, 
2003; Yamamoto and Shankar, 2004; Holdridge et al., 2005; Eluru and Bhat, 2007; Eluru et 
al., 2008; Gkritza and Mannering, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2008) which cannot further 
identify the effects of vehicle type to both parties, the BGOP model can identify the 
interrelation between the vehicle types used by two parties. According to the estimation 
results, several findings are identified. First, when the vehicle of the first party is a bus, the 
injury severity of the second party increases, since damage typically increases as vehicle size 
of the another party increases and vice versa. Additionally, if the vehicle of the first party is a 
car, then the injury severity of the second party also increases, but not vice versa. Notably, 
motorcycles have the largest effect on injury severity of the riders themselves, since the 
estimated parameters have the largest value among all explanatory variables. Those riding a 
motorcycle typically suffer serious injury regardless of whether they are the first or second 
party in an accident. This finding underscores the dangers associated with this transportation 
mode, as motorcycles lack external protection, and coincides with the fact that motorcyclist 
fatalities in Taiwan account for 56.69% of all traffic deaths (Wen et al., 2011). However, 
when the vehicle type of the second party is a motorcycle, then injury severity of the first 
party declines slightly, due to reduced impact from a motorcycle. 
 
In this analysis, intersection types affect injury severity of the second party, not that of the 
first party. When an intersection is a three-leg or multiple-leg intersection, injury severity of

Without considering “flexible” thresholds, all elasticity effects of the BOP model increase 
monotonically or decrease across severity levels (Tables 5 and 6). However, for the BGOP 
model, elasticity effects may exhibit a bi-modal pattern (i.e., have a larger effect on the two 
extreme severity levels), which can better describe the effect of a factor. Most variables 
considered in this study are categorical. The heterogeneity of variables may be rather large. 
The estimation results of the BOP and BGOP models differ, not only for signs of elasticity, 
but also for magnitude. 
 
To avoid redundant implications and discussions based on estimation results for latent 
propensity, the following only focuses on factors that have relatively large elasticity effects. 
Vehicle type of motorcycle has the largest positive elasticity effect on disabling injury and 
fatality (5231.09), underlining the danger to the first party driver and passenger when they are 
riding a motorcycle. Notably, the elasticity effect of this variable does not increase 
monotonically with injury severity, but has a large effect on severity levels of possible injury, 
and disabling injury and fatality. Additionally, this variable only reduces the probability of 
property damage, again emphasizing the risk of riding a motorcycle. This estimations result is 
in agreement with that obtained by Wen et al. (2011). The second-largest positive elasticity 
effect is colliding with a bus (43.42), and this variable (vehicle type=bus driven by the second 
party) exhibits a monotonic pattern from the least-serious severity level to the most-serious 
severity level. The third-largest positive elasticity effect is drunk driving. Drunk drivers tend 
to get injured with monotonically increasing probability. Conversely, the largest negative 
elasticity effect is to collide with a motorcycle (-4.04). 
 
For the second party (Table 6), similar to the first party, the largest elasticity effect is riding a 
motorcycle (1514.77), underscoring the danger in using this transportation mode regardless 
of whether the motorcycle is driven by the first or second party. In Taipei City, which has a 
convenient public transportation system, motorcycle ridership accounts for approximately 
30% of total trips; however, in other cities in Taiwan, ridership is as high as 70%, similar to 
that in many Asian cities. Thus, motorcycles should be equipped with enhanced passenger 
and driver protection and collision warning systems. Of course, the most effective 
countermeasure is to reduce motorcycle usage. 
 
The second- and third-largest positive elasticity effects are drunk drivers as the first or second 
party. According to the magnitudes of these elasticity effects of the two parties, being hit by a 
drunk driver is more dangerous than a drunk driver hitting another vehicle. Notably, for major 
arterials, the injury severity level of the second party is markedly reduced (-361.55), due to 
high design standards and improved sight distance. 
 
4.3 Safety Implications 
 
Several key risk factors of two-vehicle accident severity at signalized intersections are 
identified. One of the most dangerous factors is motorcycle use. Potentially effective 
strategies to improve the safety of motorcycles or reduce motorcycle usage are allocating 
lanes to motorcycles only on urban streets to reduce interactions among different vehicle 
types, to strictly enforce mandatory use of helmets for motorcycle riders, discouraging 
motorcycle usage by proving a convenient and affordable public transportation system, and 
increasing motorcycle parking fees. For further discussion of motorcycle safety measures, see 
the studies by Pai and Saleh (2007), Pai and Saleh (2008) and Pai et al. (2009). 
 
The second key factor is alcohol use. Obviously, cracking down on drunk driving is an
