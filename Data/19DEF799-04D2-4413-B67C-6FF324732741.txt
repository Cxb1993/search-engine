 一、 前言 
生物感測技術是用來將生化反應的訊號轉換成電訊號或光訊號，使人類能清楚觀測其作用的情形。由於
生化反應的動態行為是相當複雜且細微的，為了可以正確取得其反應時的動態行為和反應後的特性，設
計出一套高解析度和高靈敏度的生物感測系統是有必要的。傳統的生物感測技術，必頇事先將螢光物質
標定(Labeling)在待測物上，之後再使用特定波長的光束去激發待測物上的螢光物質，經由此螢光物質的
發光強度來得知待測物的訊息。此方法雖然有成本低及可大量平行篩檢等優點，但由於其標定螢光物質
的過程相當困難且費時，再加上其無法即時得知生化反應的動態資訊[1]，因此發展出一套免標定且可即
時偵測的生物感測技術是目前研究的重心。 
表面電漿共振(Surface Plasmon Resonance，SPR)生物感測技術是一種利用金屬薄膜和待測生物分子
之間的表面電漿共振現象，來探測生化反應的生物感測技術。其具有即時量測、免標定待測物、高靈敏
度及可大量平行篩檢等優點[2-6]，近幾年已廣泛的應用在生醫檢測、氣體偵測、待測液濃度檢測和溫度
監控等相關研究上[7-10]。 
差動技術早在很久以前就被使用於電子領域。差動意即將電壓訊號的正負兩端相減而得的訊號。使
用差動的方法來量測訊號時，經由將電壓訊號正負兩端相減，可輕易將兩個訊號的共同雜訊消除，使訊
號更為穩定。 
本研究中的光強式系統部份，基於計畫第一年之成果加以改良，以差動偵測技術配合表面電漿共振
偵測技術，不僅可保留光強式系統成本低且架構簡單的優點，也改善了光強式系統容易受到光源強度浮
動和背景光雜訊影響的缺點。並且經由差動處理後，也成功提升了光強式系統的靈敏度。而相位式系統
部份，基於計畫第二年之成果[11]加以改良，以差動偵測技術配合外差干涉術(Heterodyne Interferometry)
量測，優點在於較高的外差頻率可以避開低頻雜訊干擾，可提升相位式系統的靈敏度與解析度。 
 
 
二、 文獻探討 
本計畫中第三年部份包含光強式及相位式兩項研究，對於系統設計之考量各不相同。此節將對兩套
系統的需求分別以不同方向進行仔細的探討。 
 
2-1 光強式 
2005 年 E. S. Forzani[12]研究團隊在期刊 Environmental Science & Technology 中發表以差動偵測的方式來
擷取待測物反應後的訊號。其系統架構以一擴束光收束到感測器上的待測區域和參考區域，再以四象限
光偵測器接收其反射光，將所偵測到的四個訊號做運算來取得差動訊號，藉由此方法來減少外界雜訊。
2007 年 M. Naya[13]研究團隊於期刊 Journal of Nanaphotonics 中同樣使用差動的方式對訊號做處理。其系
統架構以一擴束光收束在感測器上，之後再由陣列式光偵測器來接收其反射光強。由於收束光會有一入
射角的角度區間，藉由將光偵測器上 24 個光偵測晶片所偵測到不同入射角的光強訊號做差動處理後，可
成功增加訊號的訊雜比。 
由以上兩個例子我們可知道，將差動技術應用在表面電漿共振技術不僅可減少共同的誤差及擾動，
還可提升訊號的訊雜比(Signal-to-noise ratio)和系統靈敏度，對於表面電漿生物感測器效能的改善有相當
大的幫助。 
 
2-2 相位式 
2004 年 C. M. Wu 與 M. C. Pao 共同提出改良式外差干涉術應用於表面電漿共振感測器[14]。此系統
以兩個聲光調制器(Acousto-optic modulator)調制產生高頻差之外差光源，並於感測器前後放置兩片四分
之一波片。第一片波片之快軸置於與光軸夾 45 度角處，即方位角呈 45 度時，可將線性偏振光轉變為圓
偏振光，使干涉訊號的對比度提升；第二片波片之方位角與光軸的夾角則可用於調整系統靈敏度。該系
統對應折射率最佳的解析度為 1×10-6 RIU。 
2005 年 R. Naraoka 與 K. Kajikawa 共同提出以旋轉檢偏板(Analyzer)穿透軸的方式結合相位式表面電
漿共振技術[15]。入射光經過以兩塊偏振片共同組合而成的裝置後，會形成高消光比(Extinction ratio)的
線性偏振光，並當此偏振光與光軸之夾角為 15 度時，在共振區域附近對量測的解析度為最佳。由作者模
擬靈敏度的結果顯示，此方法與外差干涉術配合相位式的檢測為同一等級。

圖 1 光強差動式表面電漿共振感測器之架構。 
 
圖 2 不同待測物在共振角兩側角度之反射率變化。 
 
由於共振角兩側角度的光強反射率變化方向是相反的，如圖 2 所示，圖中可觀察出 aa RR ' 為正值，而
bb RR ' 為負值，利用兩道光反射率變化方向相反的特性，可得到一個關係式： 
bbaa IIIIDSVDSV  '''  (4) 
由式(4)可觀察出，在相同的折射率變化之下，比貣兩個固定角度各別的反射光強度變化，差動訊號值擁
有較大的變化量。因此藉由差動技術可有效提升系統的靈敏度，不僅如此，經由相減的處理還可消除共
同的背景光雜訊。雖然差動技術擁有以上優點，但如果僅用相減的方式仍然無法消除光源強度浮動對於
系統的干擾。因此，為了能有效消除光源強度浮動所帶給系統影響，除此之外，又能保留原本相減所具
有的優點，本研究將定義一個新的差動訊號值 NDSV(Novel differential signal value)作為量測用的訊號。 
本研究所定義出新的差動訊號值 NDSV 是除了將兩反射光強度進行相減的處理之外，還另外進行了相加
的處理，之後再將相減的結果除以相加的結果，可得到：

從式(5)和式(6)我們可發現到，兩道入射光入射至表面電漿共振感測器以前的光強度I0均可被除去，此 I0
可表示為： 
 t)sin(ACDC(t)0 I  (7) 
其中 DC 為 I0 的直流項，AC 為 I0 的浮動振福， 為 I0 的光強浮動頻率，t 為時間。從式(7)可觀察出 0I 是
以 DC 項為中心點，隨著時間變化以 AC 項為振幅震盪，如果沒有將 I0 消去，此 I0的 AC 項將會嚴重影
響量測結果，所以藉由本系統的演算方式將 0I 去除之後可解決光源強度浮動的問題。不僅如此，假設兩
道反射光的背景光雜訊是相同的，因此可將式(8)和式(9)寫成：

 位置。 
確認共振角的位置在 43.6 度後，將兩道水平偏振光分別由表面電漿共振感測器的兩側入射，入射角
均固定於 43.6 度。固定好之後，將表面電漿共振感測器旋轉一個角度，使表面電漿共振感測器兩側入射
光的入射角分別增加和減少。若選擇適當的旋轉角度，即可將兩道入射光分別固定於共振角兩側靈敏度
較高的角度區間。 
在此參考圖 4 中氦氣的角度掃描結果，選擇旋轉角為 0.7 度，兩道入射光在感測器旋轉後，入射角
分別旋轉至 42.9 度和 44.3 度。為了配合本系統的數值運算方法，如式(5)所示，必頇確認兩道入射光在
入射至感測器之前的光強值為相同，如此才能將光源強度浮動的干擾給消除，確認之後即可開始擷取待
測物的光強差動訊號。 
 
 
圖 4 氦氣的角度掃描曲線。 
 
5-1-1 單點量測 
此部分實驗是藉由量測氦氣(1.000036 RIU)和氮氣(1.000297 RIU)之間的光強差動訊號變化，以驗證
本系統的效能。空間上取樣 30×30 像素做平均，時間上取樣每秒 30 張影像做平均，量測時間設定為 200
秒，設定完成之後即可啟動光強差動訊號擷取程式，開始進行光強差動訊號的擷取。首先，先將氦氣通
入流道，之後約每隔 20 秒即切換氣體一次，使用程式擷取兩台 CCD 所偵測到的光強訊號並做數值運算
後，所得到的光強訊號以及光強差動訊號如圖 5 所示，可觀察出當分別通入氦氣和氮氣時，本系統能檢
測出兩種不同折射率氣體的光強差動訊號變化，當通入折射率相差 0.000261 RIU 的氦氣和氮氣時，NDSV
約有 0.033 的變化。

圖 11 二氧化碳切換完畢實驗圖。 
由圖 7 至 11 可觀察出在通入氮氣和二氧化碳後，在無漆覆蓋的感測區中，光強差動訊號有明顯的變
化，而有漆覆蓋的非感測區則光強差動訊號變化較不明顯。圖 12 表示位置圖 6 中雙箭頭直線處的光強差
動訊號剖面圖，圖中可清楚觀察出分別將三種氣體通入流道後的差異，並可發現空間上的雜訊相當大，
推論是由於光源分布不平均的關係，導致光源中光強值較強的部分對於折射率變化所造成的光強訊號變
化較大，而光強值較弱的部分則光強訊號變化相對較小。由於攝影機對於光強度偵測有其最小的解析度，
因此在相同折射率變化之下，會造成攝影機無法偵測到光強值過於微弱的光強訊號變化，因而導致訊號
失真，再加上攝影機本身的電子雜訊相當大，因此造成此空間上的雜訊，預計增加光源強度和使用光強
解析度與穩定度較高的攝影機可改善此問題。另外在有漆覆蓋的非感測區理論上不應有光強差動訊號的
變化，推論可能原因是漆層太薄，導致有漆覆蓋的非感測區仍然會產生些微的表面電漿共振現象。透過
以上實驗可證明本系統具有偵測一整面待測物折測率變化的能力。

5-1-3 消除光源強度浮動實驗 
此部分實驗是藉由改變光源強度來證明本系統可消除光源強度浮動干擾的實驗，觀察NDSV是否隨著
光源強度的不同而改變，以驗證本系統對於抵抗光源強度浮動干擾的能力。空間上取樣 30×30 像素做平
均，時間上取樣每秒 30 張影像做平均，量測時間設定為 160 秒，設定完成之後即可啟動光強差動訊號擷
取程式，開始進行光強差動訊號的擷取。 
在固定待測物折射率的情形下，除了光源強度浮動會造成光強訊號變化之外，環境變化所造成的待
測物折射率改變(如溫度改變)或入射角改變(如機械振動)同樣也會造成光強訊號的變化，因此若 NDSV 隨
著光源強度變化，則不易判斷此變化為何。因此，為了能清楚觀察出本系統消除光源強度浮動干擾的能
力，在此利用大幅度改變兩道水平偏振光的光強值來進行實驗。由於此大幅度光強訊號變化遠大於待測
物折射率變化所導致的光強訊號變化，因此可將後者的光強訊號變化忽略，藉由此方式可清楚觀察出本
系統是否有消除光源強度浮動干擾的能力。

5-2相位式差動偵測 
考慮表面電漿共振發生時入射角與光強度及相位的變化關係，與多項參數有關，例如：光源波長、
稜鏡折射率、金屬材質及其膜厚、入射角以及待測物折射率等等。因此，在實際進行實驗之前，先一步

2. PRINCIPLE 
In this section, we start by explaining the optical phase variation which results from the moving rough surface. Then the 
wavelength-modulated heterodyne interferometry for the measurement of the optical phase variation is introduced. Based 
on the measured optical phase variation and the mathematical formula which will be derived below, the rough surface in-
plane displacement was obtained. 
 
2.1 Optical phase variation resulting from the moving rough surface 
A collimated light beam with wavelength λ incidents on a rough surface at an angle θ1 as shown in Fig. 1a. If the surface 
displacement along the vector zwxuL ˆˆ +=v , then the phase variation of the scattered light in observation plane can be 
written as [9] 
  ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]212112 coscossinsin2 θθθθλ
πδ +⋅+−⋅=⋅−= wuLkk v , (1) 
where k1 and k2 are the propagation vectors along the illumination and observation direction. It is obvious that the optical 
phase variation is relative to the in-plane displacement u and out-of-plane displacement w of direction x and z 
respectively. If the observation direction is parallel to the normal of the rough surface (θ2=0), then the δ reduces to 
(2π/λ)[u·sinθ1+w·(cosθ1+1)]. The aim of this study is to measure the in-plane displacement. We can use two collimated 
beams simultaneously illuminate the rough surface symmetrically to distinguish the in-plane displacement. As shown in 
Fig. 1b, the θ1 and -θ1 are the angles of illumination. Scattered lights are then observed at the normal of the rough surface. 
The phase variation of each beam when the surface moving can be written as

If considering the optical path from the light source to the observation plane, the electric fields of the two scattered lights 
on the observation plane can be written as

Here Δl is the optical path difference of two scattered lights. The in-plane displacement u is encoded in the interference 
signal, and it can be solved by the wavelength-modulated heterodyne interferometry as the following sub-sections.

period T is determined by the time clock. When the interference signal shifts to curve b, we'll have the square wave 
curve d. Similarly, the time difference ΔT=T2-T1 between curve c and d can be determined by the time clock. Therefore, 
the phase variation of the signal is obtained by Φ=2π(ΔT/T). The phase resolution of this program is about 1°. 
3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
The configuration of this method is shown in Fig. 2. A laser diode (Hitachi, HL6320G) with central wavelength 633 nm 
is used as light source. A sawtooth modulated current from the function generator (LTC100-B) is used to drive the laser 
diode. Light from the light source is divided by NPBS. The two lights go through different path and combine on the 
rough surface which is attached on the piezo stage (P-611.3S). The scattering light is received by the photodetector D 
and then the interference signal is processed by DAQ card (NI6143) and PC. To demonstrate the feasibility of our

scientific investigation and in an industrial application. They
simultaneously offer a wide measurement range with high
resolution [5–11]. If only high-frequency noise is considered,
sub-nanometer resolution can be achieved by using heterodyne
optical interferometers [7, 8]. Commercial interferometers,
such as theHewlett-Packard interferometer (HPI 5529A), have
the ability to measure a several meters range within a few
seconds and 2D measurement can be performed using two
interferometers. However, the difficulty with the heterodyne
optical interferometer actually lies in maintaining the stability
of the interferometer when increasing the measurement range
or decreasing the displacement velocity. Based on a so-called
non-common optical path (NCOP) configuration, these optical
interferometers are extremely sensitive to different kinds
of disturbances such as atmospheric influences, background
vibration and thermal drift, resulting in system inaccuracy and
instability. Therefore, researchers are paying great attention
to finding methods for large displacement measurement that
not only ensure high accuracy but also great stability.
We propose an innovative quasi-common-optical-path
(QCOP) configuration designed to effectively improve the
stability of the interferometer while still simultaneously
maintaining nanometric resolution for large displacement
(millimeter-scale) measurement. In the QCOP configuration,
the measurement and reference beams have almost equivalent
optical paths. Surrounding disturbances are compensated
in the interference signal making this technique much less
sensitive to environmental disturbances. Here, QCOP
is applied to heterodyne grating interferometry we have
recently proposed for large-scale highly resolved displacement
measurement [7]. After introducing the principle of this
technique, the system performances are presented and
discussed.
2. Principle
In general, when a light beam passes through a grating, a phase
difference occurs between the first- and zeroth-order diffracted
beams. This phase difference can be measured by the optical
heterodyne technique. The displacement of the grating is thus
determined by the relationship of the optical phase variation
and the grating pitch. Let us now precisely describe the
principle of our QCOP heterodyne grating interferometric
technique.
In previous work, we presented a heterodyne grating
interferometric technique for nanometric displacement
measurement [7]. In this study, we modify this technique
into the QCOP configuration as shown in figure 1. For
convenience, the z axis is chosen to be along the direction
of light propagation, and the x axis is along the horizontal
plane. The complex amplitude of the expanded heterodyne
light beam can be written as follows [7]:
A = A0
(
eiωt/2
e−iωt/2
)
, (1)
where ω is the heterodyne frequency. We insert a half-wave
plate (HWP) so that half of the beam is rotated by 90◦ in
polarization. The electromagnetic amplitude of this part of
the beam, called B, is given as
B = B0
(
e−iωt/2
eiωt/2
)
. (2)
The original expanded heterodyne light beam is thus
divided into two perpendicular polarizations (parts A and B).
The light beam is slightly focused on the grating before being
diffracted [9]. The shape of the spread beam is shown in
figure 1. Note that the diffracted light region comprises parts
A and B. With this configuration, the overlapped region could
be easily adjusted at the detector position by choosing the
distance between the grating and the lens. When the grating
undergoes a displacement s, the optical phase of the mth order
of diffraction φm will vary as follows [12, 13]:
φm = 2mpis/p, (3)
where p is the grating pitch. By means of choosing a suitable
focus lens and a grating pitch, the zeroth-order (m = 0) beam
will overlap with the first-order (m = 1) diffracted beam. That

sensor. As shown in figure 2, the curves are similarwith a peak-
to-peak amplitude of 1.209 µm and 1.212 µm, respectively.
The same applies to figure 3, in which the curves have a peak-
to-peak amplitude of 0.991 µm and 0.986 µm, respectively.
Besides the fact that the two methods give almost the same
displacement, it is worth noting that the measurement curves
obtained using ourmethod are as linear as those obtained using
the capacitive sensor. Furthermore, the QCOP method is also
able to sense the sinusoidal displacement as the capacitive
sensor demonstrating that theQCOPmethod has the ability and
potential to measure a small displacement with the resolution
of a commercial instrument.
In order to demonstrate that our QCOP method has
the ability to measure a millimeter-scale range displacement
with nanometer resolution, a stepper motion stage with an
integrated linear encoder was used. Figure 4 shows the
results for a 1 mm displacement. The displacement difference
between the QCOP method and the linear encoder is 154 nm
which remains within the linear encoder resolution.
Figure 4. Measurement result for a large displacement (1 mm).
Figure 5. Measurement result for a step displacement (25 nm per
step).
Experimental curves have been shifted slightly to conveniently
distinguish the measurement results obtained by our method
and the linear encoder. Clearly, the shapes of the two
measurement curves are the same, which is in agreement
with the fact that our method is able to measure a large range
(1mm)displacement as a commercial sensor. It isworth noting
here that the maximum measurement range only depends on
the total length of the diffraction grating. The one we used in
the experiment is about 50 mm. A wider diffraction grating
can be used to increase the measurement range.
In addition to the triangular and sinusoidal wave profiles,
we drove the PZT stage for 125 nm and 15 nm displacements
using steps of 25 nm and 3 nm, respectively. Experimental
data are shown in figures 5 and 6, respectively. In figure 5,
it can be seen that the trend and behavior of the displacement
measured by the QCOP method conforms to that measured
by the capacitive sensor. In figure 6, one can see that the
situation has changed. Only the QCOP system can resolve the
displacement. The position step is actually smaller than the
resolution of the capacitive sensor [15]. From the experimental

heterodyne grating interferometer).
3.4. Stability
The stage was held stationary and the long-term (1 h) phase
variation was measured such that the system stability could
be accurately estimated. Figure 8 shows the obtained results.
As shown by the two curves, the long-term stability test was
spoiled by an intermediate frequency signal that was caused
by the air conditioning. Using a linear fit, one can however
estimate the long-term stability of the two systems, which was
found to be 14 nm and 89 nm, respectively, over 60 min.
Besides the long-term stability, the results shown in figure 8
clearly illustrate how much less sensitive to the surrounding
disturbance is the QCOP configuration as compared to the
capacitive sensor. The QCOP configuration provides better
system stability and can also efficiently suppress the influence
caused by environmental noise.
4. Discussion
4.1. QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer versus angular
shearing interferometer
In the QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer configuration,
the AC term of the interference signal carries the optical phase
difference φ between the first- and zeroth-order diffracted
beams. From section 2, we know that in the case of the
QCOP configuration, φ is equal to the optical phase φ1 of the
first order of a diffraction beam which varies when the grating
moves.
If the EOM is removed, the system will become a normal
angular shearing interferometer [9]. The interference signals
I1 and I2 as defined in section 2 are equal and can be written
as
I1 = I2 = (e
iωa t + eiωa t+φ)(e−iωa t + eiωa t+φ)∗
= 2 + 2 cos(φ), (8)
where ωα is the angular optical frequency of the laser. From
equation (8), it can be seen that the interference signal of an
angular shearing interferometer varies as a cosine function as
the grating moves. In this case and in contrast to the QCOP
configuration, the moving direction cannot be assessed due to
the fact that the interference signals (I1 and I2) are equal.
Another aspect lies in the spatial distribution of the
interference intensity. In principle, in both configurations,
interference fringes between first and zeroth orders will be
observed and can indeed be used to align the grating with the
incident beam. However, because of the EOM modulation
frequency, the interference fringes in the case of the QCOP
configuration are not visible using the naked eyes. In fact, in
the case of the QCOP, fringe modulation due to the grating
displacement is also observed because the two interfering
beams are not perfectly spherical waves. As a consequence,
the QCOP interferometer is no more difficult to align than the
angular shearing interferometer.
In summary, the QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer
is sensitive to the displacement direction and compared
to the conventional shearing grating interferometer, the
performances are better as it is able to filter the noise caused
by the non-modulating frequency. Moreover, it can overcome
the disadvantages of a NCOP configuration as well.
4.2. QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer versus
conventional common and non-common path heterodyne
interferometers
In a conventional common path heterodyne interferometer
configuration [17, 18], the two orthogonally polarized (s-
and p-polarization) beams with different temporal frequencies
propagate along the same path. Therefore only the tested
sample or the system with the specific polarized properties
required, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), total
internal reflection (TIR) or phase retarder, is able to result in a
phase shift between the reference and measurement signals.
Because the reference and measurement signals propagate
along the same optical path, this kind of interferometer is
very stable.
However, when one uses a conventional heterodyne
interferometer (e.g. the Hewlett-Packard interferometer) to
measure a displacement, the two orthogonal linearly polarized
waves (s- and p-polarizations) with different temporal
frequencies will be separated [29]. Then, they will propagate
along different optical paths even if the path length remains
the same. That is, this interferometer belongs to the NCOP
configuration. Thus, the phase difference variation resulting
from the optical path difference between s- and p-polarizations
can be measured to determine the displacement.
In the QCOP configuration, the two half beams with
different temporal frequencies propagate along almost the
same path. The optical phase difference coming fromamoving
grating could be directly carried by the two half beams with
different frequencies. Therefore, the QCOP method has both
the advantages of the conventional non-common and common
optical path heterodyne interferometers.
4.3. Error analysis
As mentioned above, while the QCOP heterodyne grating
interferometer can measure a displacement, it can also

difference error due to the 0.01% polarization mixing when the total
phase difference measured by the detector is 720◦.
4.3.3. Polarization mixing error. As mentioned above,
another source of error that must be considered is that
arising from polarization mixing. Leakage of the undesired
polarization state may have different origins, such as optical
imperfections of optical components or their coatings. This
will introduce a distortion in the interference signal, whichwill
produce a nonlinearity between themeasurement displacement
and the actual displacement, which will affect the accuracy
of the measurement. Considering an ideal interference light
beam passing through an imperfect polarizer, the interference
electric field can be written as
EP =
[
1 0
0 α
] (
eiωt/2+φ + e−iωt/2
e−iωt/2+φ + eiωt/2
)
=
[
(eiωt/2+φ + e−iωt/2)
α(e−iωt/2+φ + eiωt/2)
]
(16)
ES =
[
α 0
0 1
](
eiωt/2+φ + e−iωt/2
e−iωt/2+φ + eiωt/2
)
=
[
α(eiωt/2+φ + e−iωt/2)
(e−iωt/2+φ + eiωt/2)
]
, (17)
where α is the polarization mixing ratio. The nonlinearity
phase error 18 = 8′−8 suffering from the polarization
mixing can be written as
8′ − 8 = tan−1
(
sinφ · (1− α)
cosφ · (1 + α)
)
− tan−1
(
sinφ
cosφ
)
. (18)
The extinction ratio of the polarizer is regarded as the
polarization mixing ratio, which is expected to be 0.01%
in our case. Figure 10 shows the simulation result of the
periodic nonlinear phase difference error caused by a 0.01%
polarization mixing for a total phase shift of 360◦. The
nonlinearity phase error18 here is about 0.006◦, which gives
a corresponding displacement error of about 0.014 nm. This
error can be neglected compared with the frequency mixing
error [24, 30].
4.3.4. Polarization–frequency mixing error. Let us now
consider the phase retardation error introduced by an imperfect
HWP. The phase retardation error results in an elliptical
polarization of the heterodyne light beam and thus a
polarization–frequency mixing error. According to the Jones
calculation, the phase error is equal to δ/2, where δ is the phase
retardation error of the imperfect HWP. In our case we assume
the retardation error to be of the order of 1◦, which gives a
corresponding phase error of 0.5◦ and thus a displacement error
of about 1 nm. Finally, one would have to consider the amount
of ellipticity (the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis),
which for a commercial heterodyne interferometer has been
estimated to be 0.08 [30]. This amount of ellipticity will also
result in a polarization–frequency mixing error. Fortunately,
this kind of error can be avoided by a symmetric design [30].
From the above discussion, one can conclude that in
a typical heterodyne interferometer, the polarization mixing
error is smaller than the frequency mixing error. One can
also conclude that the dominant error sources in the QCOP
method are coming from the non-uniformity of the grating
pitch and the azimuth angle of the HWP. Considering different
dominant errors, one obtained 1.2 nm resolution which has to
be comparedwith the experimental resolution of 1 nm deduced
from the step function measurement (cf figure 6).
5. Conclusion
A novel heterodyne grating interferometer for displacement
measurement has been proposed. It relies on a QCOP
design with the first- and zero-order diffracted beams partially
overlapping and interfering with each other. By measuring the
phase shift of the interference signal the displacement of the
grating can be calculated.
Feasibility and performances of the QCOP heterodyne
grating interferometer have been addressed and demonstrated
using sinusoidal and triangular wave displacement
experiments and a systematic comparison with a commercial
capacitive sensor, strain gauge and linear encoder. Based on
our experimental results, this QCOP method has the potential
to measure large displacements with a resolution of 1 nm.
The repeatability of the system was found to be less than 4 nm
together with a long-term stability of about 14 nm. Detailed
error analysis reveals the dominant error sources.
While the performances of the QCOP heterodyne grating
interferometer-based system could be further improved,
especially the time response using a dedicated phase
unwrapping module, they are already compatible with specific
applications. Further work includes the development of
a two-dimensional metrological stage based on the QCOP
heterodyne grating interferometer for enlarger near-field
microscopy [2, 16].

We present a heterodyne grating interferometer based on a quasi-common-optical-path (QCOP) design
for a two-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) straightness measurement. Two half-wave plates are utilized to ro-
tate the polarizations of two orthogonally polarized beams. The grating movement can be calculated by
measuring the phase difference variation in each axis. The experimental results demonstrate that our
method has the ability to measure two-DOF straightness and still maintain high system stability. The
proposed and demonstrated method, which relies on heterodyne interferometric phase measurement
combined with the QCOP configuration, has the advantages of high measurement resolution, relatively
straightforward operation, and high system stability. © 2011 Optical Society of America

1. Introduction
Two-axis motion systems [1] are widely applied in
many fields, such as precision engineering, metrol-
ogy, nanotechnology, lithography applications, as
well as advanced scientific applications [1–5].
Normally, these two-axis motion systems are ex-
pected to move in a straight and precise manner in
each direction. However, in practice, fabrication er-
rors in the motion system will result in motion error
that appears as movement in an orthogonal direction
from the proposed moving path. This kind of error is
called straightness error [6] and will influence the
real performance of the application system. Another
orthogonal axis is needed to compensate for the error.
For precise positioning, the movement behavior and
error motion of the motion system must be measured
or compensated for in each degree of freedom (DOF).
To achieve the high-resolution positioning needed for
nanoscale applications, methods for straightness or
linear displacement measurement are becoming
more important and have attracted a great deal of
attention.
In the past few years, numerous methods for
straightness or displacement measurement have
been proposed [7–11]. One of the most useful tools
is laser interferometry, which has been widely used

: ð3Þ
In addition, after passing through the two HWPs,
the expanded heterodyne light beams (A, B, C, and
D) are converged by a focusing lens (L1), as shown
in Fig. 3. A two-dimensional (2D) grating is posi-
tioned near the focal plane of L1. Of course, the diver-
gent light is diffracted [20]. The shapes of the
diffracted beams are shown in Fig. 3. By choosing
a suitable focus length of L1, the plus first order
and zero order of the diffraction wavefronts interfere
to generate the heterodyne signals. For example, as
shown in Fig. 3, Ax1, Ay1 represent part A of the plus-
first-order diffraction beam on the x and y axes, re-
spectively, and so on. When the grating undergoes
a displacement sq in the q direction (q ¼ x or y),
the optical phases ϕqm of themth order of the diffrac-
tion beamwill vary. The relationship between the op-
tical phases and the displacement can be written as
follows [15]:
ϕqm ¼ 2mπsq=p; ð4Þ
where p is the grating pitch. Therefore, the ampli-
tudes of the four parts of the mth order are given by

As shown in Fig. 3, by choosing a suitable focusing
lens (L1) and grating pitch, the zeroth order (m ¼ 0)
beam will overlap the first-order (m ¼ 1) diffracted
beam. For example, part B of the first order (Bx1)
overlaps with the part A of the zeroth order (A0). Cor-
respondingly, part C of the first order (Cy1) overlaps
with the part A of the zeroth order (A0).
B. Phase Difference Measurements with QCOP
Heterodyne Grating Interferometry
As mentioned above, after obtaining these two over-
lapping beams (Bx1 þ A0 and Cy1 þ A0), they are
passed through two polarizers (P1 and P2) for which
the transmittance axes are at 0°. Subsequently, the
interference lights are detected by detectors D1 and
D2, respectively. According to the optical arrange-
ment and Jones calculation [15], the interference sig-
nal I1 measured by the detector D1 can be written as

Here, the phase variation can only be induced by ϕx1;
therefore, we ensure that ϕx0 ¼ 0.
Likewise, the interference signal I2 measured by
detector D2 can be written as
I2 ¼ jP2ð0∘Þ · ðA0 þ Cy1Þj2 ¼ 2þ 2 cosðωt − ϕy1Þ: ð7Þ
A polarizer P3 with the transmittance axis at 45° and
a detectorD3 are used to measure the intensity of the
nonoverlapping area of the diffraction beam of the
zeroth order. The heterodyne signal I3, measured
by detector D3 can be written as
I3 ∝ cosðωtÞ: ð8Þ
All of these three signals I1, I2 (measurement sig-
nals), and I3 (reference signal) are sent into two
lock-in circuits for phase-difference measurement.
Meanwhile, the phase differences ϕx1 (between I1
and I3, for the x direction) and ϕy1 (between I2 and
I3, for the y direction) are then given by

quarters of the HWP (PR, retardation and FA, fast axis).

confirms that the straightness error in the y direction
obtainedbyQCOPheterodyne grating interferometer
is correct. This means that the QCOPmethod has the
ability to do straightness measurement.
Furthermore, in order to demonstrate that the
QCOP method can also be used to measure straight-
ness in the x direction without reorganizing the
optical setup, the stepper was next ordered to move
along the y axis, and the lateral displacement on the
x axis was recorded by our QCOP heterodyne grating
interferometer. The corresponding experimental
data are shown in Fig. 6. After the curve fitting pro-
cess mentioned above, the straightness on the x axis
is shown in Fig. 6. The experimental data also show a
pair of similar back-and-forth paths. The maximum
straightness error is about 550nm within the stroke
along the y direction. According to the above experi-
mental results, we could measure the straightness in
both directions (x and y) successfully. These tests de-
monstrate that our QCOP heterodyne grating inter-
ferometer has the ability to measure two-DOF
straightness.
C. Measurement Resolution
A lock-in circuit with a resolution of 0:088° is utilized
to measure the phase difference. By substituting the
resolution of the lock-in circuit intoEq. (10), we obtain
a theoretical resolution with the QCOP method of
about 0:2nm. The resolution of the interferometer
is the minimum detectable displacement [22]. Actu-
ally, the resolutionwithour setupnowcanbeobserved
by checking the amount of standard deviation of sys-
tem noise. The experimental result is shown in Fig. 7.
It also can be seen that the amplitude of the standard
deviation of system noise is about 1:37nm. Here we
define the measurement resolution of our QCOP het-
erodyne grating interferometer.
D. System Stability
In order to test system stability, the stage was held
stationary and the long-term (30 min) phase varia-
tion was performed. Figure 8 shows the results of the
two axes measurements. The stability of the QCOP
method is actually better than 40nm within 30 min.
Moreover, we found that there exists a low-frequency
disturbance with the 150 s period. We believe that
this low-frequency disturbance mainly comes from
the air conditioner. As can be seen, the period and
amplitude of the disturbance sensed along the x
and y axes are almost on par. Obviously, the system
stability performance when utilizing our QCOP con-
figuration is excellent. That is, the surrounding dis-
turbances are compensated for in the interference
signal. The results demonstrate that our QCOP con-
figuration can efficiently suppress the influence
caused by environmental noise.
4. Error Analysis
Because the QCOP method combines heterodyne in-
terferometry and shearing grating interferometry,
we need to take into account the error effects coming
from both of those interferometries. In our case, the
error mainly arises from frequency mixing error,
polarization mixing error, polarization-frequency
mixing error, and nonuniform grating pitch. Detailed
descriptions are discussed below.

direction (with and without the curve fitting method).

of the straightness measurement in the QCOP
interferometer.
In case 3 (roll occurs), as can be observed in Fig. 9
case (3), the yaw results in the diffracted angle (β)
change of the first diffracted beam. For convenience,
as a collimated beam is incident on a grating with an
angle of roll factor (θroll), the amplitude of the first-
order diffracted beam can be given by

· e−i2πsx=p;
ð16Þ
where b stands for the beam size. The phase term in
the sinc function indicates the grating equation [26].
One can see from Eq. (16) that the diffracted angle (β)
of the first-order diffracted beam will change with
the angle of the roll factor (θroll). However, when the
position of the first-order diffracted beam moves
within the measuring range of the detector, the mea-
suring phase (2πsx=p) will not be influenced by the
roll factor. This means that the roll factor will not af-
fect our measurement results.
Tosummarize, inourdesign, thepitchandroll of the
XY stepper cannot influence the straightness mea-
surement. Yaw, however, proves to be an exception.
D. Influence of the Modulation Signal Stability
A sawtooth signal with HWV is applied to the EOM
to generate a heterodyne light source. The stability of
the sawtooth signal will influence that of the inter-
ference signal and the measurement system. It is
worth mentioning here that there are two different
situations where an external sawtooth signal might
cause a measurement error. The first is when the
waveform of the sawtooth signal is incorrect. The sec-
ond is when the sawtooth voltage signal applied to
the EOM is not equal to the HWV. When these two
situations occur, the interference signal will suffer
the other frequency terms. If the lock-in amplifier
operates with a small time constant, a phase error
occurs. This error can be efficiently eliminated by
taking two separate steps. First we use the fast Four-
ier transform channel of the oscilloscope to observe
the interference signal spectrum. Next we adjust
the HWVuntil the amplitudes of the other frequency
terms drop to the minimum, except the modulation
frequency.
5. Conclusion
A novel QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer for
two-DOF straightness measurements is presented.
An expanded heterodyne beam with four orthogon-
ally polarized beams was focused on a 2D holo-
graphic grating. The plus-first- and zeroth-order
diffracted beams of the x and y axes partially overlap
and interfere with each other. By measuring the
phase shift of the interference signals from the mov-
ing grating, the grating movement can be obtained.
The experiments for measuring the straightness in
the x and y directions are described. The experimen-
tal results show that the maximum straightness er-
ror is about 500nm along the x direction and 550nm
along the y direction within a 20mm traveling range.
Experiments are performed to check the measure-
ment performance. Based on the experimental re-
sults, we achieve a system resolution and stability
with the QCOP method of up to 1.3 and 40nm within
30 min of measurement, respectively. Moreover, de-
tailed error analysis reveals that the dominant error
with the QCOP method is mainly the result of the
incorrect azimuth angle of the HWP and polarizer,
as well as the imperfect polarizer and HWP.
The proposed method of heterodyne interfero-
metric phase measurement combined with the
quasi-common optical configuration has the advan-
tages of high measurement resolution, relatively
straightforward operation, and high system stability.
While the performance of the QCOP heterodyne
grating interferometer based system could be further
improved, it is already compatible with specific ap-
plications, such as for probe-based near-field micro-
scopy and optical imaging [12,27].

In this study an alternative method based on surface plasmon resonance is proposed for in-situ monitoring of
variation in the refractive index of a test sample. A wavelength-modulated light source and an unequal-path-
length optical conﬁguration heterodyne interferometer are used to detect the phase difference change, which
can then be used to estimate the change in the refractive index of a test sample. The experimental results
demonstrate a phase stability of 0.02°. The resolution power of the refractive index is 1.5×10−6 RIU. This
method has several advantages over previously usedmethods such as simple optical setup, easier operation in
real time, and low cost.

1. Introduction
The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method is a highly sensitive
technique for evaluating the thickness of the test medium on a metal
surface [1]. Numerous real-time biomolecular interaction detection
schemes have been developed based on the SPR method. Such
schemes have been applied in a variety of ﬁelds such as pharmaceu-
tical development and life sciences [2,3]. In addition, since SPR also
provides ultra-high sensitivity for detecting tiny changes in the
refractive index (RI) or other quantities which can be converted into
an equivalent RI, it is also widely applied for the measurement of
temperature [4], pressure [5], displacement [6], angle [7], and so on.
SPR is primarily measured by the detection of the resonance angle
θr, resonance wavelength λr or optical phase ϕ. The variation in the
optical phase ϕ is much more abrupt than either the resonance angle
or wavelength as the SPR is excited [8–10], which is the phase-based
techniques have been so widely used for characterizing tiny
variations in the samples. Several novel approaches to measuring
the phase during SPR excitation have been shown to be effective. For
example, the Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) combines phase
shift techniques to determine the phase variation of SPR [11,12]. The
piezoelectric actuator, the main device providing step phase shifting
in the MZI, should be calibrated for precision step phase displace-
ment. Additionally, the non-common path conﬁguration means that
the interferometer may suffer from environmental disturbances, so
sophisticated control is required tomaintain the system stability. The
heterodyne interferometer (HI) [9,13,14] detects the SPR phase by
using a Zeeman laser or optical modulator, such as an acousto-optic
modulator or electro-optic modulator [3,4,6,7,13–16]. It has been
reported that these HI phase detection techniques offer high
measurement performance, high sensitivity and high resolution in
real time. Moreover, the common path conﬁguration of the HI makes
it very stable. However, these systems require complex and
expensive electronic equipment, such as modulation and de-
modulation instruments. Also, because steep phase variation occurs
only in a small region within the plasmon resonance dip, theMZI and
HI SPR schemes offer a limited dynamic range [17]. In this study, a
SPR-based method for the measurement of the RI change of liquids
with wavelength-modulated heterodyne interferometry [18] is
proposed. We demonstrate that we can achieve heterodyning with
wavelength modulation of a laser diode source by means of injection
current modulation, combined with an unbalanced optical path
difference conﬁguration. The variation in the signal's phase differ-
ence corresponding to the SPR's phase change can be measured by
our heterodyne phase detectionmethod. The RI change of liquids can
then be estimated from the measured phase difference variation.
There is no acousto-optical, electro-optical modulator or Zeeman
laser in our system, making it easy to operate in real time, and also
lowering the cost. In addition, the dynamic range of our method is
larger than that of older methods. The experimental results show the
feasibility of this proposed technique. With it we can achieve a
resolution of 1.5×10−6 RIU.

Here, the initial phase ϕo is eliminated. The phase difference Φ of
the detected signals contains contributions from the phase difference
ϕ between the s and p polarizations, and the reﬂective coefﬁcients |rp|
and |rs|. Because of ϕ, |rp| and |rs| are functions of the refractive index
n3 of the test sample, and the signal phase difference Φ must be a
function of n3 as obtained from Eq (8). That is, we can obtain the
variation of the refractive index Δn3 for the test sample by measuring
the variation of the signal phase difference ΔΦ at the speciﬁed
incident angle without measuring ϕ, |rp| and |rs|. Actually, although
the beam splitter BS introduces an additional phase difference ϕBS
between I1 and I2, as seen in Fig. 1, ϕBS is constant and independent of
the modulated wavelength. Therefore, the additional constant phase
difference ϕBS can be ignored in our measurement process.
3. Experimental results and discussion
The Kretschmann conﬁguration is comprised of a BK7 prism
coated with a 50 nm gold ﬁlm. As shown in Fig. 1, the gold-coated
prism was inserted into a ﬂow cell, which permitted continuous ﬂow
of the test sample in and out of the cell. A laser diode (Sharp
LT021MDO) with a wavelength of 780 nm and a power of 10 mWwas
used as a light source. It modulated a sawtooth current in the range
between 70 and 80 mA with a frequency of 200 Hz. A temperature
controller was used to keep the temperature of the laser diode at
25 °C. At the 780 nm wavelength, the refractive index of the BK7
prism is n1=1.51118. After passing through the unequal-path-length
optical conﬁguration (Michelson interferometer), a heterodyne light
with a beat frequency of 800 Hz was obtained. The center wavelength
λo of the laser diode depends on the operating temperature. The drift
of the center wavelength causes variation in the initial phase ϕo and
the beat frequency ω. Fortunately, the initial phase ϕo is eliminated
(Eq. (8)) in our differential measurement. The variation of the beat
frequency is very tiny and can be ignored.
To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposedmethod, we tested a
series of alcohol solutions with different concentrations at room
temperature. Their refractive indices were ﬁrst measured by a
commercial refractometer, which is shown in Fig. 2. Generally, the
maximum optical phase variation versus change in the refractive
index (dϕ/dn3) occurs at the resonant angle whether obtained byMZI,
HI or some other type of convective interferometry. As noted in the
principles section, Eq. (8) indicates that Φ is a function of rp, rs and ϕ,
and varies with the refractive index of sample n3 and the incident
angle θi. That is, the maximum phase difference variation of our
heterodyne signals (dΦ/dn3) does not occur at the resonant angle.
Therefore, in order to ensure high measurement sensitivity, we ﬁrst
scanned the incident angle of a sample of pure water (n3=1.3321), to
ﬁnd the suitable incident angle where the phase difference variation
was at its maximum. Alcohol solutions were then delivered to the
ﬂow cell through a ﬂow pump. Each solution was kept stationary for
about 200 s. The measurements of phase difference over time are
shown in Fig. 2. It is obvious that the differing refractive indices of the
alcohol solutions produced changes in the phase difference.
The phase difference within each stationary time was averaged;
see Fig. 2. The relationship between the averaged phase difference
variation ΔΦ and the refractive index n3 of the alcohol solutions can
be seen in Fig. 3. The solid line indicates the associated ﬁtting curve
which had a slope of about 1.3×104 (°/RIU). It is clear that with this
method and the associated ratio of ΔΦ to Δn3, we can obtain the
change in the refractive index for the alcohol solutions from the
measured ΔΦ data.
To test the system's phase stability, we usedwater as a sample. The
sample was kept at a temperature of 25 °C. The phase difference
variation within 1000 s is shown in Fig. 4. This curve shows the
presence of a lot of high and low-frequency noise. The low-frequency
phase noise may be the result of an unstable SPR system. For example,
background vibration could cause variation in the incident angle,
thermal drift could cause changes in the refractive index, and so on.
The standard deviation (Φsd) of the low-frequency phase noise is
about 0.02° in 1000 s. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the
high-frequency phase noise over a few seconds is on the milli-degree
scale. This may come from the photodetectors or from operational
ampliﬁer electronic noise. To estimate the resolution power of the
refractive index change (Δn3) with this method, we can divide the
standard deviation (Φsd) of the phase noise into the unit change of the
phase difference per refractive index (i.e., the slope of the curve in
Fig. 3) as follows:
Δn3 =
Φsd
slope
: ð9Þ
Substituting the low-frequency phase noise Φsd=0.02° and the
slope 1.3×104 (°/RIU) into Eq. (9), the resolving power of the
refractive index change (Δn3) of this method is 1.5×10−6 RIU. This
resolving power is better than the one obtained in our previous work
Fig. 2. Results of real-time measurement of pure water and four alcohol solutions.

refractive index variation of liquids. The circular heterodyne light
source used is composed of a wavelength-modulated laser diode, an
unequal-path-length optical conﬁguration and a quarter-wave plate.
In Kretschmann conﬁguration, a change of RI for the test sample
results in a differential phase variation in the signals. The change of RI
can be obtained by measuring the differential phase variation. The
experimental results demonstrate that our system has a sensitivity of
1.5×10−6 RIU. This method has the advantages of simpler optical
setup, easier operation in real time and lower cost than traditional
methods.

Owing to the quasi-common optical path conﬁguration and hetero-
dyne phase detection, this system provides high measurement
resolution and good stability. The experimental results demonstrate
that this system has reached a measurement resolution of 2.3 nm. The
device combines a coarse stage (piezoceramic motor) and a ﬁne stage
(piezoelectric actuator) to form a composite stage. The shearing
heterodyne grating interferometer was used as a displacement sensor
to servo control the composite stage for long-range positioning
applications. The experimental results show that a positioning
resolution of 2.3 nm over a traveling range of 20 mm is achieved.
2. Principles
In this section, we start by introducing the heterodyne light source.
The optical phase variation which results from the grating displace-
ment is described by the shearing interference theory. The relation-
ship between the measured optical phase variation and the grating
displacement are derived. Finally, a servo control loop used to control
the position of the composite stage is brieﬂy introduced.
2.1. Heterodyne light source
As shown in Fig. 1, the light beam⇀Ein coming from a laser source is
linearly polarized at 45° with respect to the x-axis. The fast axis of the
electro-optic modulator (EOM) is along the x-axis. An external
sawtooth voltage signal with an angular frequency ω and amplitude
Vλ/2, the half-wave voltage of the EOM, is applied. The retardation
produced by the EOM can be expressed as ωt. Thus we have a
heterodyne light source ⇀Eh and its Jones vector [15] is
⇀Eh = EOM ωtð Þ⋅⇀Ein∝ e

The beam size of the heterodyne light is extended by a beam
expander (BE). A half-wave plate (HWP) is traditionally used like a
Faraday rotator as an optical rotator. We inserted a half-wave plate
with a 45° azimuth angle to the half beam size of the expanded
heterodyne light, as shown in Fig. 1. The expanded heterodyne light in
the entrance plane (EP) can be rewritten as

where A(xo,yo)=exp[−iφ(xo,yo)] is the amplitude, with the spatial
distribution of the phases of the wavefrontφ, and a is the beam size. In
the entrance plane, the expanded heterodyne light is divided into two
parts. The polarization states of these two parts are orthogonal.
2.2. Shearing interference
For convenience, a transmission grating is used to explain the
shearing interference as shown in Fig. 2. The optical conﬁguration
shown in Fig. 2 is similar to the setup of a Ronchi test for measurement
of wave aberrations [16,17]. Since the theory behind the Ronchi test
has already been described by several authors [16–18], here we only
brieﬂy summarize the theory to introduce the heterodyne shearing
interference. A grating with pitch p is positioned near the common
focal plane of lens L1 and lens L2. Lens L1 is illuminated by the
heterodyne light (⇀EH), and the diffracted beams from the grating are
collimated by lens L2 to form a sheared interferogram. According to
the Ronchi test theory, in non-magniﬁed imaging, the coordinates of
the entrance plane and that of the observation plane (OP) coincide
with each other but their sign is inverted, that is, (xo,yo) corresponds
to (−x,−y). The complex amplitude distribution G at the observation
plane (x, y) is
⇀G x; yð Þ = ∑

where m is the diffraction order; and Bm is the amplitude of the mth
order diffraction beam; f is the focal length of L1 and L2. For convenience
of observation, Fig. 2 only shows the zero, ﬁrst and minus ﬁrst order
diffractionbeams. δ=2πd/p is theoptical phase shiftwhen thegrating is
shifted in the x direction by d. The term λf/p corresponds to the shear
distance. The focal length f and grating pitch p can be selected and we
then let the shear distance be the half of the beam size, λf/p=a/2. Let us
now consider the overlap area (0bxba/2) of the zero and the ﬁrst order
diffraction beams (m=0 and 1). The amplitude distribution in the
overlap area is

wave forms with amplitudes from several micrometers to sub-
micrometers. A strain gauge sensor equipped with a piezoelectric
actuator was used to simultaneously verify the movement. Figs. 5–7
show the measurement results obtained with our method (blue
curves). It can be seen that the results coincide well with the ones
obtained using the strain gauge sensor (green curves). The curve
measured by the strain gauge sensor is biased by a few seconds for
convenience of observation. These results conﬁrm that our system is
able to measure small displacement with good precision.
Next, in order to test the performance of the interferometer for
long-range displacement, we mounted the grating on a linear
piezoceramic motor which can provide a displacement of several
millimeters. Fig. 8 shows the measurement results for linear
displacement of 1 mm with different velocities V. A linear encoder
(Jena LIA-20) was used to simultaneously verify the displacement
(green curves). In Fig. 8, we plot the green curves with 10-second bias
for convenience of observation. The measurement results obtained
with our method (blue curves) coincide with the ones obtained with
the linear encoder, even with the different velocities. These results
demonstrate that our system is able to operate for long-range
displacement.
The total displacements (TD) measured by our system and the
linear encoder are shown in Table 1. Notwithstanding that a little
difference exists in the measured results between the linear encoder
and our system, the overall discrepancy is about 0.15 μm in ﬁve
measurements and the relative deviation is about 0.01%. We suspect
that the discrepancy may result from the following two reasons; one
is the fact that the linear encoder might not exactly coincide with the
moving direction of the grating, and the other is the lowmeasurement
resolution (100 nm) of the linear encoder. These results demonstrate
that our system is able to measure long displacements.
3.2. Displacement positioning by servo control
A linear piezoceramic motor and a piezoelectric actuator are
combined to construct a stage which can provide a displacement of
several millimeters with nanometer resolution. The servo control ﬂow
chart is shown in Fig. 4. The servo control unit operates the combined
stage which moves with several different steps for the different range
displacements. The linear encoder and strain gauge sensor are used
simultaneously to verify the displacement. Fig. 9 shows the servo
control results for the forward and backward motion with large
20 mm steps. It took about 80 s to position the stage from 0 to 20 mm.
The inserted plot shows the step response of the servo control. Even
though there is a little difference in the measured ﬁnal position
between the commercial sensors (linear encoder and strain gauge
sensor) and our system, the relative deviation is 0.001%. This means
that the measurement results obtained with our method coincide
with the ones obtained with the commercial sensors.
We conducted further experiments in which the piezoelectric
actuator stage was commanded for nanostepping 10 nm and micro-
stepping 10 μm movement; the results are shown in Fig. 10. From
these results, it can be seen that our system is able to operate small
displacement positioning with good precision. In Fig. 10(a), it can be
seen that the total displacement for 10 nm nanostepping is 60 nm, as
measured by our method and the strain gauge sensor. Although the
measurement resolution of the strain gauge sensor is about 1 nm, it
suffers from a lot of noise. Therefore the strain gauge sensor cannot
read the detailed step motion.
4. Discussion
From Eq. (11) we ﬁnd that the sensitivity ϕpdv/d is equal to 4π/p,
and thus the smaller the grating pitch, the higher the sensitivity we
can achieve. If only the phase resolution (0.09°) of our homemade
lock-in ampliﬁer is considered, the corresponding displacement
resolution is estimated to be 0.2 nm for a grating pitch of 1.67 μm.
The relationship between the displacement d and themeasured phase
variation ϕpdv is shown in Eq. (10). In the experiment, we observed
that the measured phase suffers from the problem of random noise,
which may come from the laser source, EOM, photodetectors and
operational ampliﬁer electronics. After taking the noise into consid-
eration, the measured phase difference variation in Eq. (10) can be
written as
ϕpdv = 4πd= p ϕnj j; ð12Þ
where d is the error-free displacement, and ϕn is the random phase
noises. The calculated displacement dc is given as
dc = p × ϕpdv = 4π= d∓p × ϕnj j= 4π: ð13Þ

resolution. If only high frequency noises are considered, the
measurement resolution of our system is about 2.3 nm. Owing to
the quasi-common path conﬁguration, this system is provided with
high measurement resolution and high stability. In addition to the
displacement measurement, the shearing heterodyne grating inter-
ferometer was used as a displacement sensor to servo control the
composite stage for long-range positioning applications. The exper-
imental results show that a positioning resolution of 2.3 nm over a
traveling range of 20 mm is achieved.

1. Introduction 
Displacement related measuring techniques play an important role in modem technology 
being widely applied in many fields, such as in the semiconductor industry, precision 
manufacturing, photolithography, metrology instrument, high density mass storage systems, to 
only named a few [1–5]. These types of measurement systems have been developed to such a 
stage that they are less and less restricted to just the micro-scale resolution but can now 
achieve nano-scale resolution, as well as meso-scale measurements. Therefore, much attention 
is being paid to develop more precise measuring devices or methods with the ability to 
provide exact displacement information with high precision. Various tools to achieve precise 
measurement have been developed, such as the capacitance sensor, linear encoder, strain 
gauge or interferometer [6–11]. The resolution of such measuring sensors can reach the 
nanometer, even the sub-nanometer level. Among them, one of the most common instruments 
is the capacitance sensor, which is often used because of its high measuring resolution, 
compact size and low cost. In general, the resolution of the capacitive sensor can achieve sub-
nanometer precision [7]. Unfortunately, the measuring range of this sensor type is limited to 
100 micrometers, which is not enough for meso-scale displacement measurement. 
In contrast, linear encoders are inexpensive displacement measuring sensors that have 
been adapted for displacement measuring with high resolution. Among the various types of 
linear encoders [8,9], moire encoders are most commonly used because they are relatively 
easy to manufacture and offer a high resolution-per-cost ratio. However, a measurement error 
can be caused by an unwanted assembly tilt angle between the two scales. It is difficult to 
eliminate this unwanted tilt [9]. Since the linear encoder can only be used to obtain position 
information on the assembled axis, it is much more suitable for one-dimensional displacement 
measurement. For example, for two-dimensional (2D) applications, when two linear encoders 
are implanted into an XY motion system, any fabrication error in the motion system will 
result in a motion error which appears to be orthogonal to the proposed moving path. This is 
the shortcoming of the linear encoder for 2D applications. 
Laser interferometers are very useful for displacement measurement. They not only have 
high resolution and wide dynamic measurement range, but allow for a flexible arrangement of 
optical paths and direct linkage to the length definition. There are many kinds of 
interferometer designs which have demonstrated nanometer, even sub-nanometer precision for 
long measurement ranges [11,12]. Normally, a pair of laser interferometers mounted 
perpendicular to each other can be used for 2D displacement measurement. However, it is 
essential for the two interferometers to be arranged orthogonal to each other to ensure 
measurement accuracy. The additional expense of another interferometer is another 
disadvantage for t2D measurement. Moreover, due to the fact that most interferometers are 
based on a non-common optical path (NCOP) design [10,13,14], it is difficult to avoid the 
problem of environmental disturbance arising from temperature fluctuations, air drift, etc. 
Thus if one considers that most high precision applications must be carried out in an ambient 
atmosphere (air), one of the most difficult design tasks is to make a system that is insensitive 
to disturbing variations. Much attention is being paid to finding methods for 2D displacement 
measurement that not only ensures high accuracy but also great stability. 
In a previous study, we proposed a heterodyne grating interferometer based on a quasi-
common-optical-path (QCOP) configuration for displacement measurement [11]. The QCOP 
configuration means that the measurement and reference beams of the interferometer have 
almost equivalent optical paths. Surrounding disturbances can be compensated for by this 
configuration, making the system less sensitive to environmental disturbances. However, the 
previous QCOP configuration was only for one-dimensional displacement measurement. In 
this study, we propose an innovative 2D QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer for 2D 
displacement measurement. By inserting two specific semicircular HWPs into a heterodyne 
grating interferometer, the movement of a XY motion stage can be easily and precisely 
measured. The QCOP configuration of the interferometer leads to an effective improvement in 
the system stability. The device still has the ability to measure 2D displacements 
57
2.2 Phase difference measurement with QCOP heterodyne grating interferometry 
As shown in Fig. 2, after being reflected from the mirror, the expanded heterodyne light beam 
is focused on the 2D holographic grating by a lens and then diffracted. By means of choosing 
a suitable focusing lens and grating pitch, the zero order (m = 0) beam will overlap with the 
plus and minus first order (m = 1) diffracted beams. When the grating moves with a 
displacement (lq) along the q (q = x or y) direction, the relationship between the displacement 
(lq) and the optical phase qm of the m
st
 order diffracted beam can be written as 
 2 / ,qm qm l p    (3) 
where p is the grating pitch and m is the diffraction order. The beam distribution is shown in 
detail in the inset. For example, Ax1 and Ay-1 represent the parts A of the plus and minus first 
order diffracted beam on the x and y axis, respectively, and so on. As shown in the inset, there 
are eight overlapping areas numbered from O1 to O8. Thus O5 represents the overlap of the 
part C of the 1st order (Cy1) with the part A of the 0 order (A0). Correspondingly, O1 represents 
the overlap of the part B of the 1st order (Bx1) with the part A of the 0th order (A0). It is worth 
noting here that when the grating moves along the x direction, the interference phase changes 
can be observed from the overlapping area O1 to O4. In the same way, when the grating moves 
along the y direction, the interference phase changes can be observed from the overlapping 
area O5 to O8. This means that this configuration provides four overlapping areas in each 
direction for measuring the changes in the interference phase.

The overlapping areas of O1~O8 depend on the solid angle of the focusing beam and the 
grating pitch, and can be calculated by grating equation as p(sinθin + sinθdiff) = mλ. One can 
use an iris before the focus lens to turn the solid angle. In our case, the overlapping areas of 
O1~O8 are about 0.015(radian). Moreover, two of the overlapping areas (O1 and O5) are

3. Experimental setup and system performance 
3.1 Experimental setup 
To demonstrate the feasibility of our 2D QCOP heterodyne grating interferometer, the 
displacement provided by a motion stage was measured. The experimental configuration is 
depicted in Fig. 4. The red line in Fig. 4 represents the optical path for the single type 2D 
QCOP method. This method relies on a heterodyne light source composed of a linearly 
polarized He-Ne laser light modulated by an electro-optic modulator EOM (model: 4001, 
New Focus, Inc.). The frequency difference between the p- and s- polarizations of the 
heterodyne light source is 20 kHz. A 2D diffraction grating with a pitch of 3.2 μm is mounted 
on a precision double layer XY stepper (model: XYS-50; Measure control, Inc.). A lens with a 
focal length of f = 25.4 mm, was chosen to focus the beam on the grating. The overlapping 
areas of the diffracted beams are reflected by a mirror. The interference signals are measured 
after passing through three polarizers and three detectors (model: PDA-36 EC, Thorlabs, Inc.). 
The contrast of the detection signals, the ratio of DC to AC, in our experiment is about 25%. 
However, because of the heterodyne detection, the signals with this low contrast are enough 
for phase measurement. Then, two lock-in amplifiers (model: SR850, Stanford Research

 Fig. 5. (a). Experimental results for 1D W motion; (b). The deviation between the QCOP 
method and HP 5529A. 
In order to test the potential of the QCOP method for 2D displacement measurement, 
quadrangle motion was performed for a 1 mm displacement in the X and Y directions. Since 
this commercial linear interferometer only can be used to measure 1D displacement in this 
study, we adopt the LEs to sense the displacement in their working axis to conform to the 
measured displacement obtained by our 2D QCOP method. The LE of the X axis of the 
stepper was independent of the Y axis. The moving path is classified into four parts (Path 
1~4). Experimental data are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Figure 6 shows the results in three 
dimensions. It can be seen that the trend and behavior of the displacement measured by the 2D 
QCOP method (QCOP, red, dashed line) is conformed to the displacement measured by the 
LE (LE, green, short dots). However, the experimental data show that a slight angle exists 
between the moving direction and the grating, which will cause measurement deviation 
between the QCOP and LE. Figure 7 shows a top view of the experimental results in the XY 
section. It can be seen from the local enlargement area, that when the XY stepper moves with 
a displacement of 1mm in the X direction, the 2D QCOP method measured 12 μm in the Y 
direction. The angle of misalignment was about 0.688°. There are two ways to eliminate this 
misalignment angle. One is to use a precisely rotating stage to adjust the angle between the 
grating and the XY stepper. The other is to use coordinate transformation to remove the 
effects caused by this misaligned angle. The curve of the QCOP (adjusted) (blue, solid line) 
shows the experimental results without misalignment angle effects. The difference in 
displacement in the X direction of the path 1 measured by our QCOP method and LE is 28.7 
nm for a displacement of 1 mm. This confirms that the QCOP method is able to measure 2D 
(1 mm × 1 mm) displacement as a commercial linear encoder. 
Moreover, it is worth mentioning here, by subtracting our measuring data from an ideal 
path, as one can find from Fig. 8(a), that the moving trajectory of the path 1 measured by our 
2D QCOP method is not a straight line. Clearly, there exists a lateral deviation of 0.45 μm in 
the Y direction when the XY stepper moves along the X direction for the path 1. This 
deviation is so-called straightness error, and can only be measured by our 2D QCOP method. 
This is because the two LEs cannot provide straightness information in their working 
directions but our 2D QCOP can. As shown in Fig. 8(b), we also found that there is a lateral 
deviation of 2.2 μm in the X direction when the XY stepper moves along the Y direction for 
the path 2. 
Furthermore, the XY stepper was asked to move along an octagonal path (Path 1~8). The 
experimental results are shown in Fig. 9(a). Clearly, the shapes of the two measurement 
curves, adjusted QCOP and LE are the same, which is in agreement with the fact that our 
method is able to measure 2D displacement over millimeter range. Besides, by subtracting our 
measuring data from an ideal path, the results are shown in Fig. 9(b). Figure 9(b) shows there 
is a lateral deviation of 0.55 μm in the Y direction when the XY stepper moves along the X 
direction (Path 1). Obviously, the real moving trajectory of the Path 1 can only be obtained by

where θp is the azimuth angle of the polarizer, ε is the alignment error of azimuth angle of the 
HWP, α is the extinction ratio of the imperfect polarizer, and δ is the phase retardation error 
introduced by an imperfect HWP. The interference signal can be written as follows: 
  

I E cos ' ,  AC t Φ   (13) 
where Φ ' is the deformed phase. Thus, the phase error of the single type QCOP configuration 
can be obtained by 
 
p 1' ( , , , ) ,   qΦ Φ        (14) 
and the phase error of the differential type QCOP configuration can be obtained by 
 0 90 1.' ( , , , ) '( , , , ) 2    qΦ Φ Φ           (15) 
In our current experiment setup (case 1), the minimum adjusting angles of polarizers and 
HWPs could be controlled to within 5 and 25 by precision rotation mounts. The extinction 
ratio of the polarizers and phase retardation error of HWPs are 0.0001 and 1.2°. By 
substituting the above parameters (α = 0.0001, θ0 = 0°5, θ90 = 90°5, ε = 25 and δ = 1.2°) into 
Eq. (14) and Eq. (15), the non-linear periodic error of the differential and single types are 
estimated to be about 2.4° and 1.2°. The corresponding displacements of 10.7 nm can be 
further obtained by Eq. (7) and Eq. (11). The simulation results of the non-linear periodic 
error of the differential and single types are shown in Fig. 10. However, when the azimuth 
angles of the polarizer or the HWP increases, such as θh = 47° (in case 2), the corresponding 
non-linear periodic errors for the differential and single type interferometers are 2.6° and 8.1°, 
and the corresponding displacements are 11.6 nm and 72 nm, respectively. Thus it can be seen 
that when the azimuth angle errors of the HWP or the polarizer increase, the influence of non-
linear error on differential type is much less than that on single type. Clearly, the differential 
type QCOP interferometer is suggested to avoid the influence coming from the non-linear 
periodic error. In our experiment, we found real non-linear errors of about 10 nm for every 
grating pitch in displacement. Actually, there are several ways to eliminate the non-linear 
periodic error [12]. One of the methods is to reduce the period of the grating pitch. For 
example, by replacing the period of the grating pitch of 3.2 μm with 1.67 μm, the 
corresponding non-linear periodic error of the differential type can be down to 6 nm, while 
that of the single type can be decreased to 37.6 nm. Another way of eliminating non-linear 
periodic error is to use a symmetric design [12].

An auto-focus system based on the moiré effect and a feedback control method is pre-
sented. First, a collimated laser beam passes through a focusing lens then falls incident
on the surface of the sample. The deviation of the angle of the light reﬂected back is pro-
portional to the defocus distance from the sample. The reﬂected light then passes through
two spiral gratings, producing three types of moiré pattern which can be observed and
recorded by a linear CCD. The defocus distance can be derived from the spiral angle in
the moiré pattern. The results show that auto-focusing can be achieved by the moiré
method for glass and mirror samples in a cycle time of less than 0.1 s.

1. Introduction
Auto-focus technology is widely used in many inspec-
tion instruments and in industrial applications, such as
for automatic optical inspection (AOI), in the laser machin-
ing industry, and in microscopes [1,2]. For example, in the
Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD)
industry, the most important process for control of the
quality of the display is to inspect for visual defects. There
are three main steps to the manufacturing process: array,
cell, and module assembly [3]. In the array assembly
process, transistors are fabricated on a glass substrate.
Heating causes the middle of the LCD to become lower
than the others parts because of the huge expanse of the
panel. Deformation due to unequal heating will affect the
clarity of the image during the inspection process, making
it hard to reduce the reliable cycle time in the TFT-LCD
module manufacturing process.

The simulated moiré patterns for the collimated, diver-
gent and convergent light beams are shown in Fig. 3. Eq.
(4) demonstrates the light intensity distribution of the
moiré pattern. By setting the phase term of the cosine
function to m  2p (m is an integer) as in Eq. (4), the loca-
tion of the moiré’s bright fringes in polar coordinates can
be obtained as in Eq. (5). The polar coordinates (r, h) of
the bright spiral moiré fringes are satisﬁed as in the follow-
ing equation:
2p  rm zT  tan apðzT  tan aþ pÞ þ 2Nhm ¼ 2mp: ð5Þ
Here, m = 1, 2, . . . indicates the fringe order. If the
reﬂected light is collimated (p = p01 = p2, and a = 0), the
bright moiré fringe has a radial pattern. On the other hand,
if the reﬂected light is divergent or convergent (p01 – p2),
the bright moiré fringe has a spiral pattern.
From Eq. (5) we can obtain the relationship between the

Then, with the 30 mm focal length system, the linear range
is within ±10 lm, the sensitivity is about 1.5 FV/lm, and
the resolution is about 0.67 lm.
Fig. 9 shows the S-curve test results given different
locations d of the linear CCD. It can be seen from the exper-
imental results that the experimental data coincides with
the theoretical curves (Fig. 5), and that the larger d is, the
shorter the working range and the higher the sensitivity
we have.
As a result, within the linear working range, we can
calculate the FV to ﬁnd the sample’s defocus distance. If
the sample is outside the working range, more than three
bright moiré fringes are detected from the linear CCD.
These extra fringes result in the FV counting error, and can-
not be used in the auto focusing system.
Different lens focal lengths or locations of the linear
CCD are chosen to get a long working distance or high res-
olution focusing system.
3.3. Auto-focus testing
Before carrying out the auto-focusing operation, the
S-curve of the system is characterized by moving the target
mirror and detecting the FV. The slope (Ss = FV/Dz) in the
working range is used for the auto-focusing operation. First,
the initial FV of the test sample is found by auto-focus pro-
cessing. Then, the defocus distance Dz can be calculated
using the following equation:Dz = (initial FV)/Ss. According
to the calculated defocus distance Dz, the motor moves the
test sample to achieve focus. If the sample overshoots the
focus, the same process is repeated until the FV is equal
to 0. The feedback control system is also programmed with
the LabVIEW software to carry out auto-focusing. Initially,
the sample can be located at any position within the work-
ing range. Since the FV is not equal to zero at the initial po-
sition, the system starts the auto-focusing process to ﬁnd
the position where the FV is zero. A ﬂow chart of the
auto-focus system is shown in Fig. 10. First, the sample’s
defocus distance is calculated from the moiré patterns

disturbances within the system. Environmental noise due
to things such as thermal drift or mechanical vibration
can cause the test sample to move away from the focal
plane. Our focusing system has the ability to compensate
for defocusing in a short period of time. The unsteadiness
shown during auto focus testing (see Figs. 11 and 12) arises
from environmental noise. When thermal drift and vibra-
tion are taken into consideration, the resolution of our sys-
tem is about 2 lm.
When the test sample is at the focal plane, the back re-
ﬂected light passing through the focusing lens will be col-
limated. The collimated light will produce a radial moiré
pattern. The zero FV can be obtained for any location d of
the linear CCD. However, if the pixel direction of the linear
CCD has an inclination angle hd with x axis, the linear equa-
tion of the linear CCD can be written as y = xtanhd + d (see
Fig. 13). Themth bright moiré fringe intersects the inclined
linear CCD at (xm, xmtanhd + d). By means of the same cal-
culation processes (Eqs. (7) and (8), the FV is no longer 0, in
spite of the radial moiré pattern. The nonzero FV can be
written as
FV ¼ l1  l2 ¼ jx1  x2j  jx2  x3j
¼ dð1 tan hdÞ 
d
ð1þ tan hdÞ ¼
2d  tan hd
ð1 tan2 hdÞ
: ð9Þ
The error FV can be limited to ±1 pixel, if the inclination
angle is controlled within ±0.2. On the other hand, accord-
ing to Talbot effect, the Talbot distance zT determines the
contrast of moiré pattern, and does not inﬂuence the spiral
fringe angle.
3.4. Other applications: testing straightness error with the
linear stage
This moiré method is not only able to accomplish auto-
focusing, but also measure the out-of-plane displacement.
It is well known that the performance of a linear motor
stage is unavoidably limited by geometric errors, such as
the straightness error [17], and the distance between the
individual side and the horizontal line. With our method,
the straightness error of the linear stage can be calculated.
Fig. 14 shows a schematic representation of the testing
system. An FL with a focal length of 50 mm was used to
test the straightness of the linear stage. A planar mirror
was attached to the linear stage. If the stage travels along
the y-axis and suffers from straightness error, the mirror
will move up and down in the z direction. The motion of
the mirror and the straightness error can be determined
by the detected FV variation. The measurement sensitivity
of the setup in Fig. 14 was ﬁrst tested and found to be
about 71 (FV/lm). The FV variation was then recorded
as the stage moved. The experimental results are shown
in Fig. 15. The testing stage moved back and forth with
1 mm strokes. The maximum straightness error of the test-
ing stage within the stroke was 8 FV (56 lm). Pairs of
similar back-and-forth path data show that we get the
same FV variations at the same location. As a consequence,
we believe that the vibration signals arise from the geo-
metric error of the testing stage.
4. Conclusion
In this study, a method for auto-focusing based on the
moiré effect is proposed. The device consists of two spiral
gratings and a linear CCD. Back reﬂected light from the test
sample passes through the two spiral gratings produces
moiré patterns, which are then received by the linear
CCD. The defocus distance can be determined by measur-
ing the variation in the moiré pattern. As predicted by
the theory, the simulated system can achieve a nano-scale
resolution at a working distance of hundreds of microme-
ters given different experimental parameters. The results
prove that our system can be used for transparent types

 R1 and R2 are the reflectance of beam1 and beam2, respectively. I0 is the light intensity of two beams before 
entering the SPR sensor. 
2.3. Principle of differential signal 
We define the differential signal value (DSV) by Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) and it can be expressed 
as

From Eq. (5), we can observe that I0 can be eliminated by dividing signals. We believe that the light source 
intensity fluctuation can be eliminated. The variation of the refractive index of the testing sample will result in 
the reflectance (R1 and R2) and DSV changing. That is we can determine the variation of the refractive index of 
the testing sample by monitoring DSV. The measurement sensitivity could be high when the initial light 
intensities (I1 and I2) are similar. We can choose two suitable incident angles to obtain a smaller denominator of 
Eq. (5). According to the above equations, we can obtain the relationship between refractive index of testing 
sample and DSV (see Fig. 3). The curve A and B represent the two beams are set at (θ1, θ2) and (θ1+Δθ, θ2+Δθ), 
respectively. It is obvious that the different incident angle of two beams have the different slope. The larger slop 
of the curve is, the higher measurement sensitivity is. That is we can choose the suitable incident angles of two 
beams to obtain the high measurement sensitivity.

The system diagram is shown as Fig. 4. The SPR sensor is comprised of a BK7 prism coated with a 50 nm gold 
film. A He-Ne laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a power of 10 mW is used as a light source. The 
polarizer P1 can adjust the polarization state of the incident light. The PBS separates the light beam into 
P-polarized light and S-polarized light. The quarter wave plate Q is used to convert the S-polarized light into 
P-polarized. The rotation platform R can adjust the incident angle. The angle (θ2-θ1) between beam1 and beam2 
is about 1°. The two reflected lights are received by the charge-coupled devices or photodetectors. 
4. Result 
The refractive index of nitrogen and carbon dioxide are 1.000297 and 1.000449 RIU, and are used as testing 
samples to demonstrate the feasibility. First, we injected the nitrogen, and then set the initial DSV at 40. After 
about fifty seconds, we inject the carbon dioxide, and repeat above processes several times. The measurement 
results are shown in Fig 5. It is obvious that the DSV responses clearly the injection of the different gases.

Abstract: A method of monitoring the refractive index of the sample by sensitivity-tunable 
surface plasmon resonance sensor is proposed. The tunable mechanism is to add a quarter 
wave plate and adjust the azimuth angle of it. By this method, it gets the maximum benefit 
performance of measurement. The simulated results demonstrate that when the refractive 
index of sample’s nearby 1.33, the system has a best sensitivity that is 1×105 (degree/RIU). 
This system is also easier operation in real time so it can be further used to biomedical 
detections. 
 
1.  Introduction 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is an optical phenomenon which can be applied to the precision metrology. 
Because of its benefit of highly sensitivity, it is in widespread application including measurement of refractive 
index [1], concentration of sample [2], temperature [3], and surface profile [4]. 
For the sake of detecting the bio-molecule interaction, the resolving power is becoming more important and 
needed to as mighty as possible. Heterodyne interferometry has advantages such as high sensitivity and less the 
low frequency noise. Therefore, with many phase-based SPR sensors, the heterodyne interferometry is usually 
adopted in order to enhance the performance. Nowadays, the phase-based SPR sensors which combined with 
heterodyne or phase-shift interferometry can already provide high resolution. Meanwhile, C. M. Wu [5] 
presented a scheme to adjust the sensitivity by controlling the azimuth angle of quarter wave plate. That has 
triple resolution when it compares to traditional phase-based SPR. However, as often as not the phase-based 
SPR lack of the dynamic range. That causes a small ambit of measurement. Here, we present a system which is 
tunable for sensitivity or sensing range depends on the difference of refractive index. 
This system is improved by the passed research of our laboratory [1]. In that study, wavelength-modulated 
laser diode (LD) and unequal-path-length optical configuration are used as a heterodyne light. Nowadays, both 
the sensitivity and dynamic range are adjustable. The sensitivity is decuple higher when the sample altered in 
small scale. Even if the resolving abilities are distinct at different regions, it can still adjust to the best 
performance. 
2.  Principles 
Kretschmann’s configuration is usually used to excite SPR [6], and the Jones matrix of the reflection of SPR can 
be express as:

where rp,s and p,s are the reflective coefficients and the optical phase, respectively. 
The subscript p or s represents the polarization state. Both rp,s and p,s are function of the incident angle, 
wavelength of light, dielectric constant and thickness of the gold film, refractive index of prism and refractive 
index of sample. 
In this study, a LD combines with Michelson interferometer as a heterodyne light source [1], as shown in 
Fig.1. The cost is lower than other kinds of heterodyne light sources such as Zeeman laser, acousto-optic 
modulator or electro-optic modulator. A heterodyne light source Eh passes the quarter wave plate. The 
polarization state (circularly, ellipse or linear) depends on the azimuth angle. 
After passing through the SPR sensor, the heterodyne light beam is divided into two paths and passing 
rotating analyzers AN1 and AN2 which transmittance axes at 45° and -45°, respectively. The electric field of each 
light is:

The dielectric constant of chrome -2.13+21.49i is also taking into consider. 
When the incident angle fixed at 64.4°, the differential phase  is changing as the azimuth angle of 
quarter wave plate changed. As shown in Fig. 3, the solid and dash curve are the relationship between and 
for water and alcohol solution. When the azimuth angle of quarter wave plate is nearby 10°, the difference 
of differential phase  is the highest. We can estimate the sensitivity by 1.3325 and 1.3330, and the Fig. 4 
shows the highest simulation sensitivity is about 1×10
5
 (degree/RIU). As well as the simulated results are 
demonstrated that the sensor is capable of tunable sensitivity.

4.  Future work 
In order to further prove, we planning to measure two kinds of sample with larger refractive index difference. It 
is important to select the azimuth angle of quarter wave plate so the dynamic range is enough for two samples. 
We anticipate the two differential phases can obvious being distinguish, but the sensitivity is lower than best 
performance place. Even through the sensitivity is a little lower than best performance place, it offers a higher 
chose of refractive index difference. Moreover, we intend to increasing the sensing area into two-dimensional.

 moudulator (EOM) which is driven by an external sawtooth signal with an angular frequency (and amplitude 
of half-wavelength-voltage. According to the optical heterodyne theory proposed by Su [6], the frequency 
difference (between the p- and s- polarizations of the heterodyne light source can be obtained. The beam size 
of the heterodyne light source is expanded by the beam expander. Two semicircular half wave plates whose fast 
axes are set at 45
०
 are used to rotate polarization. After passing through the two semicircular half wave plates, 
the polarizations of the heterodyne beam is divided into 4 parts ( part A, B, C, and D). The Jones vectors of 
these 4 parts are shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed description is in our previous works [4,5]. 
2.2 Grating interferometer 
As shown in Fig.1, the expanded heterodyne beam is focused on the reflective 2D grating by the focus lens. The 
focal lens and grating pitch are appropriate so that the zero order diffracted beam has a small part of overlap 
area with first order diffracted beam, as shown in Fig.1(b). Where Ax1 and Ax-1 represent the parts A of the 
plus and minus first order diffracted beam on the x direction, respectively, and so on. The partial overlapping 
beams (A0+Bx1) and (A0+Cy1) pass through two polarizers (P1 and P2) whose transmittance axes are at 0°. 
According to the principle of our previous works [4,5], the interference signals I1 and I2 can be obtained by the 
detector D1 and D2. I1 and I2 can be written as  
 )cos(11 xtI    (1) 
 
)cos(12 ytI   , (2) 
where the x and y are the phase variation when the grating moves along x and y axis, respectively. The 
reference signal I3 is detected by the detector D3 and can be written as 
 
)cos(13 tI  . (3) 
Meanwhile, the signals (I1, I3) and (I2, I3) are sent into two lock-in amplifier respectively, and then the phase 
variations can be obtained. The relationship between the phase variations and the displacement of the grating can 
be written as 
 
pl yxyx /2 ,,   , (4) 
where P stands for the grating pitch and lx,y represents the displacement of moving grating in each axis. 
Therefore, the grating displacement of each direction can be obtained by 
 
 2/,, yxyx pl   (5) 
This 2D measurement system is also quasi-common-optical-path design, and we believe that it can maintain the 
stability of this system. 
3. Experiment setup:  
A He–Ne laser with wavelength 632.8 nm modulated by an electro-optic modulator (model: 4001, New Focus, 
Inc.) was used as the heterodyne light source. The frequency between p- and s- polarized components was 20 
kHz. Here we first used a 2D transmission grating to demonstrate the feasibility. The 2D transmission grating 
with 3.2 μm pitch was mounted on a precision double layer XY stepper to diffract the heterodyne light source. A 
commercial linear encoders was integrated with the XY stepper to measure the displacement of the 2D grating 
for comparing. The phase variations in x and y directions were measured by two lock-in amplifier (model: 
SR850, Stanford Research Systems, Inc.) with an angular resolution of 0.001°. 
4. Experiment result: 
The experimental result of octagonal displacement measurement is shown in Fig.3. The green dots represent the 
path that measured by the commercial linear encodes (LEs) when we asked the positioning stage to move. The 
blue line is the trace that measured by our QCOP method. The difference between LEs and QCOP is because of 
our QCOP method can measure displacement and straightness at the same time, while LEs can only measure the 
displacement. It’s obvious our method can achieve 2D displacement measurement with millimeter range. Fig.4 
shows the straightness measurement for real-time. While we control the positioning stage to move forward and 
backward along the x direction, our QCOP system has the ability to measure lateral displacement in y direction 
without change the measuring configuration. It shows that there is a lateral displacement of about 3.5 μm in y 
direction when we asked stage to move a displacement of 20 mm along the x direction. A curve fitting method 
was used to eliminate the effect of slope. The result is shown in Fig.5. We can see there is about ± 0.25 μm 
straightness error during the traveling. From the similar paths back-and-forth shown in Fig.5, we know that the 
straightness error in y direction can be obtained by our QCOP system. This means that the QCOP system has the 
ability to measure displacement and straightness at the same time.

Abstract:  
An auto-focus system based on the moiré effect and the 
P control method is presented. First, a collimated laser beam 
passes through a focusing lens and falls incident on the 
surface of the sample. The deviation of the angle of the light 
reflected back is proportional to the defocus distance from 
the sample. The reflected light then passes through two 
spiral gratings, where three types of moiré patterns are 
observed and received by a linear CCD. A new formula is 
derived for finding the focus value (FV) in order to calculate 
the spiral angle of the moiré pattern and to determine the 
defocus distance from the sample. The results show that 
auto-focus should be achieved in a very short time by means 
of the defocus distance calculation and P control method. 
Keywords: Auto-focus, Moiré, Spiral grating 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Auto-focus technology is widely used in many inspection 
instruments and industrial applications, such as for 
automatic optical inspection (AOI), laser machining 
industries, microscopes, etc. [1-2] To save costs, increase 
reliability, and speed up the inspection or manufacturing 
process of these inspection or machining systems, a fast and 
accurate auto-focus system plays an essential role [3-5]. 
There are two types of auto-focus technology. One is the 
active type and the other is the passive type. The 
conventional active auto-focus system measures the distance 
to the subject independently of the optical system, and then 
adjusts the optical system to attain a correct focus. On the 
other hand, the passive auto-focus system corrects the focus 
through analysis of the image that enters the optical system. 
The active auto-focus system has difficulty dealing with 
transparent specimens, such as glass plates, accurately, 
because of the low reflectivity [6]. Though the passive auto-
focus system can be adapted to transparent samples, a 
complicated image process can be to time-consuming (e.g., 
with an execution time of more than 5 seconds) [7-8]. In 
order to improve the conventional auto-focus techniques, a 
novel active auto-focus method based on the moiré effect is 
presented in this paper. 
In our system, two spiral gratings that produce three 
types of moiré patterns are used to check the quality of the 
collimation of the beam reflected from the specimen. This is 
because, when the sample moves along the optical axis, the 
divergent (or convergent) reflected light will produce a 
clockwise (or counterclockwise) spiral moiré pattern, but the 
collimated ones produce a radial moiré pattern. From the 
radial or spiral nature of the moiré pattern we can determine 
whether the sample is located on the focal point. 
2.  PRINCIPLE 
 2.1 Variation in Moiré patterns resulting from the 
defocus distance between the lens and the sample 
In this section, we start by explaining the variation in the 
moiré pattern which results from the defocus distance 
between the lens and the sample. The focus position is 
obtained based on the measured moiré pattern variation 
using the mathematical formula as derived below. 
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show a collimated laser beam from the 
laser diode (LD) and a collimated lens (CL) incident on the 
sample after passing through a beam-splitter (BS) and a 
focusing lens (FL). The light reflected from the sample then 
passes through the focusing lens, BS, two spiral gratings t1, 
t2 separated by the Talbot distance zT, to be received by a 
linear CCD. The light passing through the focusing lens will 
be collimated if the sample is located at the focus of the lens. 
On the other hand, the light will be divergent or convergent 
when the sample is out of focus. According to the Moiré 
theories, divergent (or convergent) reflected light will 
produce a clockwise (or counter clockwise) spiral moiré 
pattern, and collimated light produces a radial moiré pattern. 
We used a linear CCD to capture a part of the moiré pattern, 
and calculate the spiral magnitude using a newly defined 
focus value (FV) to determine the defocusing distance from 
the sample. By using the measured FV, the auto-focus 
system tunes the sample position using a step motor until the 
sample is in focus. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the ray tracing principle, where the 
collimated light incident on the focusing lens is reflected 
back from the sample.

an instance when the linear range is about 100 m in our 
experiment; the system can focus quite easily within this 
linear range.  
 Fig. 4 Theoretical curve of FV versus defocus distance. 
3.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This section discusses the measured FV variation versus 
the displacement of the sample, and auto-focus testing. The 
experimental configuration is shown in Fig. 1. A laser diode 
(HL6320G) with a central wavelength 635 nm was used as a 
light source. The collimated laser beam was focused on the 
sample using a 50 mm bi-convex lens. The back reflected 
light passes through two spiral gratings, to create three types 
of moiré patterns like the ones shown in Fig. 3. 
A cross-section of the moiré patterns was observed 
during the experiments by a linear CCD. A step motor 
(Tanlian ST-5055) was used to move the sample along the 
optical axis, and the FV was calculated by a Labview 
program. We use the P control system which is also 
programmed using  Labview software to achieve the goal of 
auto-focus. The experiments show the feasibility of the 
system for mirror and glass samples. 
The step motor drives the mirror and the glass. The 
displacement is about 100 m. The measured FV is shown 
in Fig. 5. Obviously, the measurement results produced by 
our method coincide with the theoretical curve. The FV is 
measured by the linear CCD in order to figure out the 
feasible displacement or defocus distance. For the sample 
we find the focal plane of the optical system when the FV is 
zero. From Fig. 5 we observe that the system sensitivity is 
about 0.85 FV/m. In principle, the minimum 
distinguishable variation of FV is 1 pixel. This means that 
the theoretical resolution is about 1.2 m. According to Fig. 
4, the system sensitivity (FV/m) or slope of the curve 
depends on the focal length. This means that the shorter the 
focal length used, the better the resolution the system has. 
For any auto-focus methods speed is always the most 
important issue. The performance of our system was 
measured by estimating the execution time and timing the 
auto-focus system. The sample could be located at any 
position within working range. Because the FV is not equal 
to zero at the initial position, the system starts auto-focus 
processing in order to find the position where the FV is zero. 
The results are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The vertical axis 
is the distance the test sample shifts from the initial position, 
and the horizontal axis is the time. The execution time of the 
auto-focus system can be divided into two types [7]: the data 
calculation time, and the motor movement time. In our 
system, the FV calculation time is about 0.025 s. The 
maximum speed of the step motor is 312.5 m per second. 
From Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, we can see that the execution time 
for focusing is about 0.1 s. Compared with image processing 
in a passive autofocus system, our method can greatly 
reduce the execution time. After about  0.1s, the curve 
vibrates with an amplitude of about 2 m meaning that there 
are some disturbances within  the system. We think that 
vibration of the motor causes the sample to deviate from the 
focal plane. If the vibration is taken into consideration the 
resolution of our system is about 2 m.
