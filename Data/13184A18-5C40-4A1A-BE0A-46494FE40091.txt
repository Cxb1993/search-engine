Abstract Wavelet-based higher-order
spectra (WHOS) analysis is addressed for
condition monitoring of induction machines.
This advanced signal processing technique
combining wavelet analysis and higher-order
spectra (HOS) allows the detection and
characterization of non-Gaussian and non-
stationary signals with time resolution and the
discrimination linear processes from nonlinear
ones. In the present investigation, application
of this new technique to detect and identify
an induction machine’s asymmetry faults by
measuring vibration data and analyzing the
nonlinearity of the machine, due to the fact
that damaged or faulty machines often gener-
ate highly nonlinear signals. The usefulness
and statistical robustness of this approach are
confirmed in the experiment. The results and
analysis indicate that this novel signal pro-
cessing technique can be successfully applied
to induction machine condition monitoring.

Wavelet analysis is an approach which decom-
poses a time-domain signal into components in
different time windows and different frequency
bands and presents the resulting information
in the form of a surface in the time-frequency
plane, sometimes referred to as a scalogram
[3]. The scalogram is similar in concept to
the spectrogram but differs from in that the
frequency resolution of the scalogram is loga-
rithmic rather than linear, as is the case for
the spectrogram. Because of the nature of
the frequency resolution, the wavelet approach
is more effective in analyzing both the long-
time, low-frequency and the short-time, high-
frequency content of a time signal. This char-
acteristic is very useful for analyzing pulse-like
and non-stationary signals.
The continuous wavelet transform of a
square-integrable, continuous time signal s(t)
is the inner product between and the analyzing
wavelet ψa,b(t), which gives the wavelet coeffi-
cients
Wx(a, b) =
1√
a
∫ ∞
−∞
s(t)ψ∗(
t− b
a
) (1)
where a is the dilation parameter governing the
wavelet frequency, b is the parameter localizing
the wavelet function in the time domain and
ψ∗(t)is the complex conjugate of the analyzing
wavelet ψ(t).
The Fourier transform of s(t) is defines as
S(f) =
∫ ∞
−∞
x(t)e−j2piftdt (2)
Whereas Fourier decomposition is based on
the harmonic wave e−j2pift, the wavelet anal-
ysis is based on an analyzing wavelet. There
are a number of different complex or real val-
ued functions used as analyzing wavelets. The
analyzing wavelet used in this paper is the
complex-valued Morlet wavelet given by
ψM(t) = ej2pif0te−t
2/2 (3)
where f0 is the central frequency of the Mor-
let wavelet and the value of f0 is taken 1 in this
paper.
An alternative formulation of the continuous
wavelet transform can be obtained by trans-
forming both the signal s(t) and the analyzing
wavelet ψa,b(t) in the frequency domain:
Wx(a, b) =
√
a
∫ ∞
−∞
S(f)Ψ∗(af)ej2pifbdf (4)
where Ψ∗(af)ej2pifb is the Fourier transform
of ψ∗( t−b
a
) respectively. For an easier imple-
mentation of wavelet transform, equation (4)
can be expressed in a discrete form as:
Wx(ap, bq) =
√
ap
∑
k
S(fk)Ψ
∗(apfk)ej2pifkbq
(5)
HOS is a relatively new tool in the arena
of signal processing. One of the major advan-
tages of using HOS is the ability to detect non-
linearity. Since damaged machines are often
related to nonlinear phenomenon, HOS anal-
ysis can provide more information than the
3
The Fourier-based higher-order spectral
methods are not capable of capturing the
transient intermittent nonlinear interactions.
Therefore, the use of wavelet-based HOS is the
thrust of this study.
After a short description of wavelet analysis
and Fourier-based HOS analysis, the develop-
ment of WHOS is the trust of this paper. The
definitions of WHOS are completely analogous
to the usual definitions used in the section .
Note that the wavlet-based spectral charac-
teristics are expressed in terms of scale instead
of using frequency index. The frequency index
f used here is directly related to an instanta-
neous frequency f = 1/a.
The wavelet-based power spectrum, accord-
ing to Eqs. (1) and (7) is given by
PW (a) = E[Wx(a)W
∗
x (a) ] (14)
By analogy to the definition of the bispec-
trum in Fourier terms using Eqs. (1) and (8),
the wavelet-based bispectrum is given by
BW (ak, al) = E[Wx(ak)Wx(al)W
∗
x (ak+l) ]
(15)
where ak+l is according to frequency sum rule,
analogy to Eq. (9), given by
1
ak+l
=
1
ak
+
1
al
(16)
A normalized version of the wavelet-based
bicoherence spectrum [6] according to Eqs. (1)
and (10) is then given by
bW (ak, al) =
|BW (ak, al)|√
E[|Wx(ak)Wx(al)|2]
√
E[|Wx(ak+l)|2]
(17)
Similarly, the wavelet-based trispectrum ac-
cording to Eqs. (1) and (10) is given by
TW (ak, al, am) =
E[Wx(ak)Wx(al)Wx(am)W
∗
x (ak+l+m)] (18)
where
1
ak+l+m
=
1
ak
+
1
al
+
1
am
(19)
四、 結論與成果
In practice, when the finite observed data,
x(0), x(1), . . . , x(N − 1) is available, the esti-
mation procedure of the wavelet-based bispec-
trum is as follows [6, 7]:
1. The discrete continuous wavelet coeffi-
cients Wx(ap, bq) are first computed using
Eqs. (3) and (5).
2. The estimated wavelet-based bispectrum
is then obtained by using an time integra-
tion of the wavelet coefficients product.
