Results and Discussion 
From the point contact reaction, Ni atoms dissolve and diffuse interstitially in 
Si
19
 and stop at the ends of the Si nanowire, thereby nucleating growth of Ni silicide 
to form a Ni silicide nanowire.

 Figure 1 shows a TEM image of the formation of 
nickel silicide from both ends of a Si nanowire at 700 °C annealing. If annealing is 
stopped before the entire nanowire transforms into NiSi, a Ni silicide/Si/Ni silicide 
nano-heterostructure is formed. From high-resolution TEM images, selected area 
diffraction patterns, and EDS analysis, we identified the structure of the silicide to be 
single-crystal NiSi.

 The darker regions at the two ends are NiSi and the lighter 
region in the middle is Si.  
Figures 2(A) to 2(C) show a set of high-resolution TEM images of the atomically 
flat NiSi/Si interface taken as the interface advances into the Si. The interface is 
parallel to the (111) plane of Si. From the high resolution TEM images, we can 
measure the dimension of the Si region, count the number of the Si atomic layers 
inside, and then calculate the average interplanar spacing. As a consequence, it was 
found that the average interplanar spacing decreased as the two NiSi/Si interfaces 
moved closer. The remaining Si with average lattice spacing of 0.301, 0.296 and 
0.292 nm is shown, respectively. There is already compressive strain of 7% in 
comparison with the original lattice spacing.  
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the compressive strain compared with 
the average interplanar spacing of Si (111) without annealing and the spacing of the Si 
region in the NiSi/Si/NiSi nano-heterostructure. It is surprising that the remaining Si 
exhibited unusually large and compressive strain which increased as the dimension of 
the remaining Si decreased. On the basis of the results from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it can be 
inferred that as the dimension continues to shrink, the compressive strain of the Si 
region would be up to 10%. Our previous studies show that we can control the 
dimension down to 2 nm,
13
 which may contribute to even larger strain.  
In the process of NiSi formation, the diffusion of Ni atoms into Si lattice could 
have led to volume expansion. However, due to the confinement of the oxide outside 
the Si nanowires, NiSi coming from both sides compressed the middle Si region, 
resulting in compressive stress on Si and dimension decrease of Si (111) lattice. As 
the NiSi/Si interfaces from both sides moved closer to each other, there was bigger 
stress on the Si region, contributing to larger compressive strain. From another point 
of view, due to the difference in the interplanar spacing of Si and NiSi across the 
epitaxial interface, Si would be stretched radially at the interface. Thus, on the basis 
of Poisson‟s ratio20, Si will be compressed axially. On the other hand, for fixed strain 
4 
 
remaining Si can also be tuned with appropriate spacing. The properties of the 
nanostructure electronics is expected to be significantly impacted by the existent 
strain for potential applications of one-dimensional nano-heterostructures in 
nano-electronic devices.  
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the NiSi/Si/NiSi nano-heterostructures 
contain highly strained Si by in situ TEM observation. Counting the number of (111) 
lattice planes in the Si region, we can determine the strain and we find that the Si is 
highly compressed. From the growth rate, we are able to control the formation of 
nano-heterostructures of silicide/Si/silicide down to a few nanometers or even atomic 
scale. Additionally, knowing the relationship between strain and spacing of the Si 
region, we can control the strain of the remaining Si. Furthermore, correlation among 
the current output, the Si channel length and the compressive strain has been found in 
our electrical measurements of the nanodevices from such nanoheterostructures. We 
may tune the current output by controlling the Si channel length and the compressive 
strain based on this study.
