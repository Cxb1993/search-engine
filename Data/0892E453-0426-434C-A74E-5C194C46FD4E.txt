regarding product.  Although design chain as well as 
customer chain has been suggested in recent years by 
practitioners and scholars to be integrated into 
traditional supply chain so that problem of product 
innovation could be improved, very few successful 
cases are reported yet.  Industries concern also the 
negative impact of new integrated supply chain model 
upon the performances of cost, quality, delivery and 
flexibility in spite of the improvement of product 
innovation.  
This proposal will use empirical study to find 
thoroughly regarding 1) key factors that may 
influence the effectiveness of design chain and 
customer chain to be integrated into traditional 
supply chain and 2) impact of the new integrated 
model upon the performances of product innovation, 
cost, quality, delivery and flexibility. ’The 
Customer Chain Effectiveness’ is the primary focus 
of this report.

Nevertheless, Twigg [13] pointed out that, in addition to DC management model between 
manufacturer and supplier, consideration should also be given to build contact channels with 
customers. Chuang and O’Grady [17] further indicated that a complete DC framework should take 
into account building up a customer management model for effectively obtaining customer’s needs. 
In fact, whether new products can completely pleasure customers pivots on mastering of customer’s 
needs.  As a result, as far as DC is concerned, it is important to construct contact channels with 
customers also. Ishii [18] proposed that, if DC can combine with CC, it will be able to effectively 
gather customer’s needs information and benefit product development. CC is designed to closely 
integrate with customers through effective management model for obtaining customer’s feedback. 
There are a couple of studies addressing how to effectively construct a CC framework, for example, 
the Supply Chain Council (SCC) formulated CCOR (Customer Chain Operations Reference Model) 
[19] and Donaldson et al. [20] proposed a Customer Value Chain Analysis model.  
Though some studies have proposed CC construction models, other research such as Robert & 
Veryzer [21] in discussing factors that affect product development pointed out that, customers’ 
understanding of a product was limited and that therefore they could hardly describe their needs for 
a new product clearly. Ishii [18] also indicated that, even if CC could form an effective tool for 
effectively management customers, when customers’ feedback became less, it was more 
unfavorable for product innovation. In order to address this problem, when CC is introduced and 
constructed, what extraordinary work should it go through to increase customer information 
feedback results? Past research rarely touched on this subject. 
Based on the above discussion, the objective of this empirical study is to identify the key factors 
that will affect the successful execution of CC. This study is based on the samples from the 
International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) database, a global research network initiated 
by London Business School. 
 
2. LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESIS  
An observation showed that, before introducing CC, customers’ information feedback will be 
increased through two key operations to facilitate effective execution of CC:   establishment of a 
data warehousing system (DWS) and establishment of a flexible service workflow (FSWf).  
Kärkkäinen and Elfvengren [22] argued that mastering customer’s needs was crucial for elevating 
firm’s PIC. In order to efficiently master information of customer’s needs, customer’s feedback is 
essential. Previous research believed that, through e-Commerce interactive platform, it was possible 
to really grasp information on customer’s needs and urged customer to feedback. However, 
experiences of the industry practitioners showed that customers usually will not interact on an 
e-Commerce platform. For this reason, how to dig out information from customer’s underlying 
behaviors had become the key to grasp customer’s needs. To that end, an observation showed that 
construction of a DWS would be more effective for gathering information of customer’s needs than 
e-Commerce. A DWS is similar to a multi-dimensional data cube concept. A useful data could be 
formed through analyzing and summarizing in different dimensions, which could exactly reflect

SCM are also collected. The survey employed questionnaire of five-point Likert scale as the means 
of measurement. 
The survey of fifth iteration (IMSS-Ⅴ) was performed in  2009 and the data were published in 
2010. It was involved by researchers worldwide including Europe (13 countries), the Americas 
(USA, Canada, Brazil and Mexico), and some of Asia countries (Taiwan, China, Japan and Korea). 
IMSS-V focuses upon the manufacturing firms related to fabricated metal products; machinery and 
equipment; office, accounting and computing machinery; electrical machinery and apparatus; radio, 
television and communication equipment and apparatus; medical, precision and optical instruments, 
watches and clocks; motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers ; other transport equipment. Total 725 
respondents from 21 countries were recorded in the final releasing. These data were used for this 
study. 
Firstly, the samples were classified by citing the method of Frohlich and Westbrook [27]. As a result, 
only 245 samples were able to fit the research purpose. And then, 16 samples were eliminated for 
whose responses were not complete or with missing values for variables of DWS, FSWf, CC 
effectiveness, and PIC. Therefore, only 229 of the 725 respondents are remained, i.e. the sample 
size of this study is 229. 
3.2 Operationalization Variables and Independent Construct Measurement 
In terms of research purpose, this study involved the testing of four variables: DWS, FSWf, CC 
effectiveness, and PIC. 
Definition of DWS in this study focused on the activities of applying electronic tools to record and 
analyze customers’ needs for improving product design and innovation. IMSS-V provided five 
kinds of DWS-related activities including: (1) scouting/pre-quality, (2) RFx(request for quotation, 
proposal, information), (3) data analysis, (4) order management and tracking, and (5) contract and 
document management. For these five kinds of DWS activities, this study firstly used mean value, 
standard deviation, and Skewness and Kurtosis to check whether the data are normally distributed. 
Test result indicated that data distribution has shown normally (please refer to Appendix A for 
details). To ensure that these test variables meet the research’s requirements, then a construct 
validity test for DWS by factor analysis was performed. The test results indicated that the 
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of performance adequacy was 0.79, Bartlett’s test of 
sphericity was significant, Factor loading for all five items exceeded 0.62, and the results of 
Cronbach’s α in factor exceeded 0.78. 
Definition of FSMf in this study focused on the activities of shifting manufacturing towards 
services. IMSS-V included five measurement items regarding to establishment of FSWf: (1) 
power-by-the-hour (total responsibility for the product), (2) product upgrade (software, product 
modification), (3) help desk/customer support centre, (4) engaging in expanding the service offering, 
and (5) developing the skills to improve the service offering. Following the same processes, mean 
value, standard deviation, and Skewness and Kurtosis were used to verify data normality; 
significant results were achieved for these five items. And then, a factor analysis was done to check 
construct validity of FSWf. The test results showed that the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of

PIC. Meanwhile, it also could be deduced why the DWS and FSWf play important roles on CC. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
The objective of this empirical study is to identify the key factors that will affect the successful 
execution of CC. The test results showed that two factors, DWS as well as FSWf, are able to 
significantly influence the effectiveness of CC. In addition, the test results also proved that an 
effective CC framework can significantly improve the PIC of manufacturing firms. In the 
implication, manufacturer can consider the result to construct an effective CC framework and to 
secure high innovative performance through successful execution of CC. On the other hands, 
researchers can refer to the result to explore deeply the issues of CC.  
Since empirical studies with regard to CC are still rare, future research may consider exploring 
more thoroughly which could are factors affecting the successful introduction and execution of CC.
