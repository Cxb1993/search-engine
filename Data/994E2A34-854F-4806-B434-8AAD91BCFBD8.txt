2which has not been reported to the best
of our knowledge. The core-shell
structures were grown through a novel
process involving a catalyst-assisted
chemical vapor reaction and the use of
surface-treated Si substrate.
Experimental
As-received p-type Si (100)
wafers were mechanically scratched,
cut into 1 cm × 1 cm, and used as the
substrates to grow the SiC nanowires.
The substrate was put into a quartz
boat placed in the center of a quartz
tube reactor having a diameter of 2.54
cm. Ferrocene was used as the source
of iron catalyst and placed upstream
5.0 cm away from the center of the
substrate. The growth took place at
1100 ℃ in a mixture of CH4 and H2.
The growth time was 10 mins or less.
The morphology and structure of the
resulting deposits were examined
using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), electron
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy
(Jobin Yvon/Labram HR), and
cathodoluminescence (CL).
Results and discussions
Abundant SiC nanowires (NWs)
were found on mechanically scratched
Si substrates but little or none on
as-received Si substrates. Fig. 1A
shows an SEM image of typical SiC
nanowires obtained. The SiC-NWs
have an average length in the order of
101 m and were grown almost
exclusively inside the scratches. The
diameters are in the range of 20 to 40
nm with an average value of 30 nm. A
TEM image showing the general
morphology of the nanowires is given
in Fig.1B. The SiC-NW consists of a
SiC core and an amorphous SiO2 shell
structure. The insert in Fig. 1B is an
electron diffraction pattern revealing
the cubic structure of the SiC nanowire.
Fig.1C shows a high-resolution TEM
image of a nanowire, indicating the
highly crystalline structure. The
atomic resolved image shows that the
(111) fringes makes an angle of 710 to
the wire axis and have an average
spacing of 2.5A, which is close to that
4correspond to 280 nm (4.42 eV), 460
nm (2.7 eV), 550 nm (2.25 eV) and
630 nm (1.97 eV). The peaks at 280
nm [11] and 460 nm [12] are
associated with the SiO2 layer. The
later one is attributed to the oxygen
vacancy in the SiO2 [12]. The peak at
550 nm is thought to be associated
with the band edge of beta-SiC. The
peak at 630 nm may come from
impurities or defect structures. Again
the peak intensities observed to be
following the thickness of shell, when
the SiO2 thickness around 5 nm the
luminescence intensity of 280nm peak
is lower when it is 12-15nm indicating
the influence of SiO2.
The growth mechanism of
SiC-SiO2 nanowires formation is
depicted in Fig. 3 and described as
follows. The silicon substrate has its
own native oxide (Fig 3A), but on
scratching the grooves were with new
oxide layer. The formation of new
oxide layer along with native oxide
makes it more porous because of poor
structural integrity. On decomposition
of Ferrocene iron releases and then
deposited on the scratched substrate
containing native SiO2 as well as
newly formed oxide as shown in Fig 3
B. The iron particles preferentially
deposits at grooves of scratched
surface because of high surface energy
as reported by Li et al. [13]. The TEM
(Fig. 4) image revealed the nano
structure of iron particles (3-5nm),
similar to Zhang et al. [14] but
different with Liu et al. [5]. The iron
particles then diffuse into mixed SiO2
layer [15] (native and newly formed)
as shown in Fig. 3C. On increasing the
temperature iron mixed with SiO2
starts to form islands (Fig. 3D)
because of different co-efficient of
thermal expansions of SiO2, Fe and Si.
When the flux of carbon, as a result of
methane pyrolysis, reaches the
substrate, adsorption occurs especially
on groove faces to reduce the surface
energy. Subsequently diffusion of
carbon occurs through the iron
containing SiO2 layer and nucleation
of SiC occurred at the groove faces by
taking up the silicon from the substrate
6quite close to our observed value of
610. The shift of 2.50 could be
associated with the higher surface
energy of (311) than (111) [20]. The
other higher index planes also make
similar angles (720 to 730) to the {111},
but the probability of forming such a
plane is unlikely. When the flux of
carbon vapors approaches the substrate
with a specific groove face orientation,
such as (111) or (311), thus formed
SiC {111} makes angle of 710 or 610
to the wire axis respectively.
The formation of straight SiC
nanowires is catalyzed by the Fe
nanoparticles follow the VLS growth
mechanism as described by Zhang et
al. and Shim et al. [16, 21]. But here
we propose a mechanism which is not
following vapour-liquid-solid, since
the Si and C sources are supplied
separately from the solid and the gas
phases. There are still some issues
unresolved regarding the SiC nanowire
growth and its mechanism. The
formation of FeSi phase could be
possible at the interface, but we
observed some amount of CNTs
indicating a less likely situation as
FeSi reduces the activity of iron for
CNT growth [22] or could be localized
only. The role of carbon from
ferrocene is not clear whether that is
involved with the nucleation of SiC or
only left as an amorphous layer on the
substrate. Again the role of iron in the
luminescence property is also not
definite and the work is underway to
understand fully.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have
synthesized beta-SiC-NWs as
core-shell structure on a Si-substrate
using a simple catalytic reaction at
1100C. The Si substrate and CH4 were
used as the Si and C sources
respectively. The catalyst was iron
nanoparticles formed using the
ferrocene source on the Si substrate.
The HRTEM and SAD patterns reveal
the single crystalline cubic structure
and the [111] growth direction. At
900C and no scratch substrate
SiC-NWs are not observed. The

We report here a simple method for the synthesis of SiC nanowires having
core-shell structures and their cathodoluminescence study, which has not
been reported to the best of our knowledge. The core-shell structures were
grown through a novel process involving a catalyst-assisted chemical
vapor reaction and the use of surface-treated Si substrate. The Si
substrate and CH4 were used as the Si and C sources respectively. The
presence of specific groove orientation of scratched surface is one of the
prime criteria for the growth of SiC-SiO2 nanowires. We believe the
present method would be a promising way for the production of high
purity SiC-NWs due to its simplicity and one step process. A growth
mechanism is also presented.

In this paper, we report the effect of Al underlayer on the growth characteristics of carbon
nanotubes grown on Si substrate using as-deposited and plasma etched Fe-Si catalyst films as the
catalysts. Al thin films having various thicknesses ranging from 2 nm to 42 nm were deposited on
the Si substrates prior to the deposition of the Fe-Si catalysts. The Al underlayer diffuses into the
Fe-Si catalyst, leading to the swelling and amorphortization of the catalyst. This allows enhanced
carbon diffusion in the catalyst and therefore a faster growth rate of carbon nanotubes. We show
that use of an Al interlayer having a thickness ~31 nm is most effective. Due to such an
effectiveness, the normally required catalyst etched is no longer needed for the growth of CNTs.

3. Results and discussions
The surface morphology and the crystallinity of both Fe-Si catalyst and Al/Fe-Si catalyst
before and after the hydrogen etching are first discussed. Both the as-deposited Fe-Si and Al/Fe-Si
thin films generally exhibit a smooth surface. After the hydrogen etching, SEM plane view
images indicate the formation of particles on the surface. Both etched films have similar particle
sizes except that the size distribution for the former seems to be wider than the latter. As-grown
Fe-Si and Al/Fe-Si films are in general amorphous except that a very weak and broaden-Fe (110)
peak is occasionally observed in their GIXD spectra. Sputter deposited silicon is known to exhibit
an amorphous structure [14]. Its presence in a Fe-Si thin film breaks up the otherwise long-chain
order of the Fe [15], leading to the disappearance of or reduced crystalline peaks. After the
hydrogen etching, although SEM images shows particle-like surface morphologies for etched films,
TEM analysis indicates that the formation of particles is only a surface phenomenon for both the
etched Fe-Si and Al/Fe-Si catalysts. Fig. 1A shows a TEM cross sectional image of an etched
Fe-Si catalyst, bounded by the two dotted lines. It is seen that only the region near the surface
become particles, adjacent to which there is a flat region. It is noted that the thickness of the
catalyst increases from 24 nm for its as-deposited state to 42 nm for its etched state. The flat
region alone has a thickness of 12 nm. The hydrogen bombardment on the catalyst during the
etching obviously swells. Also, unlike the as-deposited Fe-Si, there is an Fe3O4 phase in the
etched Fe-Si catalyst as shown by the lower-right SAD pattern in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B is a high
resolution TEM image showing Fe3O4 nanocrystals. The surface of Al/Fe-Si catalyst also becomes
particle-like after the hydrogen etching as mentioned above. However, the swelling is more severe.
For example, the thickness increases from 2 nm (Al) + 24 nm (Fe-Si) = 26 nm for its as-deposited
state to 46 nm for its etched state. Notably is that the flat region alone has a thickness of 18 nm,
which is almost 50% thicker than that of etched Fe-Si catalyst. Furthermore, Fe3O4 phase was not
found as shown in Fig. 1C. Also, the Al interlayer is no longer seen. The Al is not seen in these
images as it has diffused into the Fe-Si. (The dark line right above the Si in Fig. 1C appears due to
de-focusing.) EXAD analysis showing the diffusion of Al into Fe-Si is given in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A
shows the cross-section of 2-nm-Al/Fe-Si catalysts with the presence of Fe, Si, O, and Al.
Compositional line scans performed across the film thickness is given in Fig. 2B. This clearly
shows that the entire 2-nm thick Al layer has diffused into the Fe-Si during either the etching or the
growth. Al was found to diffuse up to a depth of 35nm into the Fe-Si film. Al concentration
increases after 18 nm from the Si substrate and reached a maxima at 28 nm. Most of the Al atoms
were diffused over a region of ~20 nm, limited between ~18-38 nm. This depth of diffusion is
dependent on the diffusion time i.e. etching plus deposition time. For Al/Fe-Si having thicker Al
interlayers, i.e., 4 nm, 8 nm, and 12 nm, the cross sectional morphologies and microstructure are
similar to that of 2-nm-Al/Fe-Si except that the Al interlayers are visible in the 8-nm-Al and
12-nm-Al/Fe-Si catalysts.
Figs. 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D show SEM cross-sectional images of CNTs grown on various etched
6resulting CNTs exhibit similar microstructure as shown by Raman analysis. Fig. 6 shows the
Raman spectra of CNTs grown on etched Fe-Si, as-deposited Al/Fe-Si, and etched Al/Fe-Si at a
methane concentration of 4/9. Commonly observed D-band and G-band are seen. Significant
downshift of the D-band is seen. This may be due to the increased C–C distance within the
grapheme sheets by high incident laser power heating [19]. It also appears that the CNTs grown
on as-deposited Al/Fe-Si contains more defects as its ID/IG ratio is higher and the full width at the
half maximum (FWHF) is smaller. Finally, the fact that all the ID/IG ratios are greater than 1 is
due to the presence of 2-D disordered structures in the basal plane which is quite common in
pyrolytic carbon materials synthesized using MPCVD [21].
4. Conclusions
Vertically aligned CNTs have been synthesized using Fe-Si catalysts deposited on Si substrates
with and without an Al underlayer at a low temperature of 370 °C. Effect of the Al thickness
has been investigated. In particular, the average lengths of the CNTs grown on Al/Fe-Si catalysts
having ~31 nm of Al are more than 3 times higher than that grown on Al/Fe-Si catalysts having no
Al or thicker Al. Within this thickness range, the use of Al interlayer is in fact so effective such
that normally required catalyst etched is waived. Such beneficial effects were observed regardless
of the methane concentration used. The effects are attributed to the diffusion of appropriate
amount of Al into Fe-Si catalyst which causes swelling of the catalyst, i.e., making the catalyst
porous. Excessive amounts of aluminum in the catalyst retard the carbon diffusivity. Therefore,
the positive effect of porous structure is no longer effective and the CNT growth rate reduces to that
similar to the case when only Fe-Si is used.

Introduction
Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) thin films and coatings are an important integral part of a
number of electro-optical devices. They are used as, for example, electrodes for the operation of
the devices. Typical TCOs include Sn-doped indium oxides (ITO)1,2, Al-doped zinc oxides
(AZO)2,3, Ga-doped zinc oxides (GZO)2,4,5, and F-doped tin oxides (FTO)6. To obtain desired
electrical and optical properties, these TCOs are normally deposited at elevated temperatures or
subjected to post-deposition heat treatment. This prevents the use of low melting point substrates,
such as flexible plastics. Efforts have therefore been made to improve the electrical conductivity
via the development of multilayer structures consisting of oxide/metal/oxide.
Earlier works involving the introduction of a metal between TCOs layers were to develop heat
mirrors made of TiO2/Ag/TiO2, TiO2/Ag/TiO2/Ag/TiO27, and ZnS/Ag/ZnS8. Other studies on
multilayer structures were to develop electrode for use, mostly, in flat panel displays. They
include ZnS/Ag/ZnS films 9 , 10 , 11 , ITO/Ag/ITO films 12 , 13 , IZO/AgPd films 14 , oxide/Ag
alloy/oxide/Ag alloy/oxide where the oxide is either ITO or Sn-doped CdO (ICO) films15, and
ZnO/Al/ZnO films16. Conductive transparent thin films of TiO2/Ag/TiO2 also were investigated
for use as electrodes in DSSCs17. It appears that Ag is a popular metal used in various multilayer
structures. However, a disadvantage is that corrosion was observed due to defects originating
from the Ag layer 18,19. In this study, we have investigated the characteristics of a tri-layer film,
GZO/Pt/GZO thin film. For comparison, the characteristics of both GZO films and bi-layer
Pt/GZO films were also examined. GZO was used for its popularity. Based on the consideration
of thermal stability, Pt was selected as the mid-lay metal. Among the characteristics studied, the
optical properties were addressed. They were examined as a function of the total or layer
thickness. Effects of the total or layer thickness on the optical transmittance were discussed
through theoretical calculations. The theoretical calculations also allow the prediction of layer
thickness such that improved optical transmittance can be achieved.
Experimental
GZO films were first deposited on glass substrates using rf magnetron sputter deposition.
The target material used was a 3-inch 5% Ga doped ZnO. The rf power, working pressure, and
target-substrate distance were respectively 150W, 10 mTorr, and 5cm. Different deposition times
(1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min, and 15 min) were used. A Pt thin film was deposited on the
GZO films using dc magnetron sputter deposition to form Pt/GZO. The working pressure and dc
power for the Pt thin film deposition were 10 mTorr and 20W, respectively. The target used was a
3-inch Pt target with a purity of 99.99%. Different deposition times were used for the deposition.
The bi-layer thin films were further deposited with a top layer of GZO thin film to form
GZO/Pt/GZO. In one group of the tri-layer films, the thicknesses of the two identical outer GZO
layers are kept at 22 nm, while that of the Pt mid-layer varies. The Pt film thicknesses are 4 nm, 6
nm, 8 nm, and 10 nm. In the other group of the tri-layer films, the thickness of the Pt mid-layer is
kept at 4 nm, while that of the two identical outer GZO layers varies.
The surface morphology and roughness were analyzed using high resolution scanning electron
microscopy (HRSEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The film thickness was determined
20
film of the same thickness. Also shown in Fig. 2A is that the transmittance of the Pt/GZO film
decreases with the Pt film thickness. This is further illustrated in Fig. 2B where the optical
transmittances of Pt/GZO thin films at 500 nm are shown (filled circles). This is explained
theoretically through the following calculations. For a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous
transmitting medium, the optical transmittance, T, across a boundary can be described as22
where It is the transmitted flux density, Iin the incident
flux density, t the refracted angle, in the incident angle, nt the refractive index of transmitting
medium, nin the refractive index of incident medium, Et the electric field in the transmitting medium,
and Ein the electric field in the incident medium. For multilayered thin films, the light crosses
more than one boundaries and the relationship between the incident wave and the transmitted wave
is
Ej and Hj are respectively the electric and magnetic fields
across boundary j (i = 1, 2, to n+1).

Therefore, assuming that all the boundaries are perfect in Pt/GZO films, the optical transmittance
can be calculated using Eq. (2) where Ein and Et are determined using Eq. (3). The n/k values used
in each material characteristic matrix Mj were obtained from the ellipsometry measurements on Pt
films. Also to calculate the transmittance using Eq. (2), nt = nin = 1 for the air. Furthermore, in
this study the incident anglein was maintained at 0 degree and therefore cosin equals to 1. In the
mean time, the detection of transmitted light was also normal to the specimen and therefore cost
equals to 1. The calculated results are represented by the dotted line shown in Fig. 2B. The
calculated transmittances are higher than the experimental data. The difference becomes larger
when the Pt film becomes thicker. This is attributed to the fact that the boundaries in Pt/GZO thin
films are not perfect as voids were observed between the Pt layer and the GZO layer. The

calculations also allow the prediction of layer thickness such that improved optical transmittance
can be achieved. The optical transmittances at 500 nm for GZO/Pt/GZO thin films having two
identical GZO outer layers with different thicknesses and a Pt mid-layer also with different
thicknesses were calculated. The results are given in Fig. 4. As shown in this figure, the
transmittance peaks when the outer layer GZO has a thickness near 60 nm. Also, the thinner the
Pt layer is, the better the optical transmittance is. Among them, the highest transmittance is about
82% which occurs in the 62-nm GZO/4-nm Pt/62-nm GZO thin film. Therefore, a 60-nm
GZO/4-nm Pt/60-nm GZO thin film and a 22-nm GZO/4-nm Pt/22-nm GZO thin film were
fabricated and measured for the optical transmittances. Fig. 5 shows the optical transmittances of
these two films. In accordance to the theoretical calculations shown in Fig. 4, the 60-nm
GZO/4-nm Pt/60-nm GZO thin film indeed exhibits a much better optical transmittance in the
visible range than the 22-nm GZO/4-nm Pt/22-nm GZO thin film. The transmittance is
significantly enhanced by 10% to 18%. In the UV region (<400 nm), the 60-nm GZO/4-nm
Pt/60-nm GZO thin film, however, has a lower transmittance. As aforementioned, the occurrence
of UV transmittance in the GZO/Pt/GZO is due to the skin depth effect. Therefore, the thinner the
GZO layer is, the higher the optical transmittance is in the UV range.
Finally, the electrical resistivity of GZO, Pt/GZO, and GZO/Pt/GZO thin films was determined
and compared. The electrical resistivity of as-deposited GZO thin film decreases slightly with the
thickness and is in the order of 10-2-cm. On the other hand, both the Pt/GZO and GZO/Pt/GZO
films exhibit resistivity that is at least one order of magnitude lower than the GZO as shown in Fig.
6. This is obviously due to the introduction of the Pt layer. The reduction of the electrical
resistivity due to the addition of a Pt interlayer can be explained by considering the following
parallel model24. The measured resistance, Rs, of a tri-layer thin film having identical outer layers
can be expressed as a function of the resistance of the outer layers, Ro and the middle layer, Rm, by
A GZO thin film can be considered as a tri-layer GZO and therefore Rm equals Ro. For a
GZO/Pt/GZO thin film, the value of Rm is that of the Pt mid-layer. This has a much lower value
than that of GZO film. As a result, according to Eq. (6), a GZO/Pt/GZO film has a lower
resistivity than a GZO film of the same dimensions. Also, the lower the Rm is, i.e., for thicker Pt,
the lower the Rs is as shown in Fig. 6. The electrical resistivity of GZO/Pt/GZO thin film ranges
from 1.98 × 10-3 to as low as 5.58 × 10-4 -cm. It is noted that these are room-temperature
deposited films without being subjected to any post-deposition heat treatment. Although the
optical transmittance in the visible range is not high, the GZO/Pt/GZO thin films having the
electrical resistivity described above are desirable for use as electrodes in DSSCs.
Conclusion
We have investigated GZO, Pt/GZO, and GZO/Pt/GZO thin films for their characteristics.
While GZO thin films exhibit optical transmittances greater than 80% in the visible range, the
electrical resistivity is high, in the order of 10-2 -cm. To reduce the electrical resistivity, a Pt

Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grown in soda-lime glass microchannels using microwave plasma
enhanced chemical vapor deposition and an Fe-Si thin film catalyst. It was found that CNT
growth in the microchannels is different from that on flat substrates. The growth length is
proportional to t0.5 for the CNTs grown in microchannels; whereas the length is proportional to t1.5
for the CNTs grown on flat substrates. The former is attributed a diffusion-controlled growth
mechanism where the depth of the microchannel serves a diffusion boundary layer; while the later
is attributed to a reaction-control growth mechanism where the growth rate increases linearly with
the methane concentration used. From Raman analysis, the CNTs grown in microchannels at low
methane concentrations seem to have better crystalline structure than that grown on flat substrates.
The opposite is true at high methane concentrations. The cross point is at a methane concentration
of 18%.

demonstrate the growth of CNTs on the bottom surfaces of microchannels in glass substrates using
a Fe-Si thin film as the catalyst and MPCVD as the growth method. Both the growth and the
characteristics of the resulting CNTs were examined. For comparison, flat glass substrates were
also used.
2. Experimental
As-received flat soda-lime glass substrates and glass substrates having straight microchannels were
used for the growth of CNTs. The microchannels were fabricated on as-received glass substrates
using a standard micro-fabrication technique. Microchannels that are 15 mm long and 140m
wide, and have various depths of 20m, 25m, 30m, and 35m were fabricated. A
magnetron sputter deposition system was used to deposit Fe-Si catalyst thin films on flat glass
substrates and the bottom surfaces of microchannels at room temperature and an Ar pressure of 1 ×
10-2 Torr. Prior to the growth of CNTs, the catalyst thin film was etched using hydrogen plasma in
the microwave reactor at a power of 700 W and a pressure of 20 Torr for 5 minutes. After the
etching, methane was admitted for the growth of CNTs. For CNT growth, the microwave power
used was 500 W, the pressure was 20 Torr, the methane concentrations were 10%, 18%, 25%, and
31%, and the growth time varied. During the growth, specimens were heated by the plasma alone
to a temperature near 370℃. It is noted that no external bias voltage was applied to the substrate.
Specimens of catalyst thin films and CNTs were subjected to a number of analysis including x-ray
diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy (laser
wavelength = 633 nm) .
3. Results and discussion
It was found that all the Fe-Si films deposited on flat glass substrates and the bottom surfaces of
microchannels have fragmented into particles after the etching. The average particles sizes on the
flat substrate and in the microchannel are respectively 20±10 nm and 52±8 nm. The latter has a
larger average particle size as the hydrogen plasma density is believed to be lower in the
microchannel, leading to a reduced etching efficiency. Although Fe-Si thin films were deposited
on the bottom surfaces of microchannels having various depths, only the microchannels having of
20m and 25m allow the growth of CNTs. Very minor growth of CNTs was occasionally
observed in microchannels having a depth of 30m. This is attributed, in part, to the much lower
plasma pressure or larger mean free path in the sputter system than that in the MPCVD system.
Fig. 1 shows SEM cross sectional images of typical CNTs grown on a flat substrate and in a
microchannel. The methane concentration used was 25%. The growth times were 5 min (Fig.
1A) and 7 min (Fig. 1B). For CNTs grown on flat substrate, the growth rate, Rf, was found to
increase linearly with the methane concentration, [C], as shown by the solid line in Fig. 2. The
slope of the solid line is 0.36. This indicates that the CNT growth on flat substrate is a first-order
reaction, i.e., Rf[C]. For CNTs grown in microchannel, the dependence of the growth rate on
the methane concentration is much less or little as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 2. The slope
of the dashed line is only 0.008, which is two order of magnitude lower than that of the solid line.
This is to say that, for CNTs grown in microchannel, the growth rate is nearly independent of the
methane concentration. Such different dependences on the methane concentration will be
36
grown on flat substrates.
4. Conclusion
For their versatile applications, CNTs are often required to grown on different substrates having
various geometries. In this study, CNTs were grown on the bottoms of microchannels in soda-lime
glass substrates. The growth took place at 370 ℃ in a microwave plasma enhanced chemical
vapor deposition system where an Fe-Si thin film was used as the catalyst. For comparison, CNTs
were also grown on flat soda-line glass substrates under the same plasma conditions. It was found
that the growth kinetics of CNTs growth in the microchannels is quite different from that on flat
substrates. For the CNTs grown in microchannels, the length is proportional to t0.5; while for the
CNTs grown on flat substrates, the length is proportional to t1.5. The former is attributed to a
diffusion-controlled growth mechanism where the depth of the microchannel serves a diffusion
boundary layer. The later is attributed to a reaction-control growth mechanism where the growth
rate increases linearly with the methane concentration used. Raman analysis shows that all the
CNTs obtained exhibit characteristics peaks of D-band and G-band. However, from the FWHM
and Id/Ig ratio, it was found that the CNTs grown in microchannels at low methane concentrations
seem to have better crystalline structure than that grown on flat substrates. Vice versa is true at
high methane concentrations.

Abstract
Carbon nanofibers having smooth, spherical beads are synthesized using a catalyst assisted vapor
phase process under various ratios of methane/hydrogen mixtures. Fe1-xSx powers were used as
the catalyst. The synthesis temperatures were 1100 ℃ and 1200 ℃, which are lower than the
ones used previously for the formation of beaded carbon nanofibers or nanotubes. Unlike the high
temperature (1300 ℃) grown beads that may exhibit a rough surface, all the beads obtained at
both 1100 ℃ and 1200 ℃ have a smooth surface. The diameter and the linear density (no. of
beads per unit fiber length) of the beads do not seem to correlate to the growth temperature and the
methane concentration. The linear density is also independent of the growth time. However, the
beads grow with time. Although the grown mechanism is not clear at the present time, it seems
that a three-dimensional model play a role.

1100℃ and 1200. In each experiment, the methane/hydrogen gas mixture was introduced into the
tube when it reached the growth temperature. Prior to the admission of the gas mixture, the
chamber was kept at an Ar pressure that is slightly higher than 1 atm. The growth time was 15
minutes; whereas a few experiments were performed at shorter growth times. Growth products
were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM).
Results and discussion
Under all the growth conditions, the majority of the carbon products are CNFs as shown in Fig. 1.
The surface roughness of CNFs varies with the growth condition. There are also CNFs resembling
long-grain chains and beaded CNFs in which the beads exhibit a smooth surface. For the
discussion below, we first summarize the morphologies obtained under different growth conditions
in Table I. CNFs obtained at low methane concentrations in general exhibit a smooth surface.
Slightly roughened surfaces were observed for CNFs obtained at methane concentrations of 30%
and 50 % when the temperatures are 1100 ℃ and 1200 ℃, respectively. As the methane
concentration increase, apparent roughened surfaces are observed, as shown in Fig. 2A for CNFs
obtained at 70% methane concentration and 1100 ℃. An apparent surface is referred to a surface
having grain-like deposits as shown in Fig. 2A. The grains are amorphous as shown by the
lower-right insert in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2A also shows the tubular nature of the fiber. At a higher
temperature (1200 ℃), CNFs resembling a long grain chain (LGCNFs) were observed at a methane
concentration of 50%. This is shown in Fig. 2B where chain-like CNFs are seen at the right.
From SEM images, the diameters and therefore the thickening rates of CNFs, including SRSCNFs
and RSCNFs, were determined. Fig. 3 shows the thickening rate at different methane
concentrations and temperatures. The arrows are for visual guide only. At both growth
temperatures, the thickening rate appears to increases and then decreases with the methane
concentration. The turning point occurs at a lower methane concentration for the 1200 ℃ growth.
The reduced thicken rates are associated with two observations. Although not quantitatively
determined, it is found that the fibrous carbon becomes less and pyrolytic carbon deposits on the
substrate and the inner wall of the reaction tube are significant. This is attributed to catalyst
poisoning due to the excess carbon at high methane concentrations. These excess carbon also
leads to the formation of BCNFs, as indicated Table I.
Fig. 4 shows BCNFs obtained at different growth conditions. The beads are amorphous and can
be spheres, slightly elongated spheres, or ellipsoids. Regardless of the shape, the beads all have a
smooth surface. This is different from the rough-surfaced beads observed at higher temperatures
as mentioned above. Throughout a single CNF, the fiber exhibits a homogeneous diameter except
when near beads. In almost all the cases, there are more than one bead in a single CNF. The
bead diameter varies in a CNF and from one CNF to another. The variation in bead diameter can
be significant, as shown in Fig. 4. The distance between two beads in individual CNFs was also
found to vary. The shape, diameter, and the linear density (no. of beads per unit fiber length) of
the beads do not seem to correlate to the growth temperature and the methane concentration. The
linear density is also independent of the growth time. However, the beads grow with time, as
48
density of beads do not depend on the growth conditions except that the diameter increases with
time. Also, unlike the high temperature (1300 ℃) grown beads that may exhibit a rough surface,
all the beads obtained in this study at both 1100 ℃ and 1200 ℃ have a smooth surface.
Although the grown mechanism is not clear at the present time, it seems that a three-dimensional
model plays a role. Investigations are currently being performed.
