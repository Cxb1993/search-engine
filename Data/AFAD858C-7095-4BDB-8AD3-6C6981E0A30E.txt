Abstract
In order to understand the distribution and corrosion
influence of air-borne salt near Taiwan marine area, by
setting up onsite-exposure air-borne salt collectors
suggested by Public Work Research Institute (PWRI, 1993)
in Japan and Japan Industrial Standard(JIS) Z2382 (1998),
the effect and availability of the different types of air-borne
salt collectors were compared. Besides, the environmental
factors such as temperature, rainfall, wind direction, etc.
were also correlated with the stochastic distribution of
air-borne salt. By means of up-to-18month collected data,
the comparisons of the air-borne salt corrosion collectors
are illustrated through the analysis given in this paper.
Keywords: air-borne salt, corrosion, onsite-exposure tests
1. Introduction
At present, RC structures are still the representative
construction works at practice. Because the weather in
Taiwan is sea-island weather, the RC structures in Taiwan
are prone to be attacked by chloride ion. The corrosion of
RC structure is hard to be found at its incubation period
while it reaches its deterioration period when found. As a
result, how to prevent in the design stage or early stage of
corrosion is the key to effectively solve the corrosion
problem of RC structures.
As known, the potential corrosion of the marine RC
structures is closely related to the amount of air-borne salt,
which strongly depends on the meteorological and
geographical features of the location. However, the site
data on air-borne salt near Taiwan marine area has been not
fully established, this research aims at conducting up-to-18
month experimental program; i.e. site collection and
analysis of air-borne salt and meteorological information
for the southern Taiwan marine area at more-than-ten
locations. Through the collected data up to 18 months (Lin
2008), the comparisons of the air-borne salt corrosion
collectors are illustrated through the analysis given in this
paper, which can be used as the design reference for the
required service life under various air-borne salt attack
environments..
2. Selection of Air-Borne Salt (ABS) Collectors
and Exposure Locations
In order to trap air-borne salt near Taiwan marine area,
the ABS collectors suggested by JIS Z2382 and PWRI
were adopted due to the similar marine environment both
in Taiwan and in Japan. The details for both types of ABS
collectors are subsequently explained. In addition, the
geographical data for the selected exposure-sites as well as
the procedure for analyzing the amount of chloride within
the collected air-borne salt are individually elucidated.
2.1 ABS Collector Suggested by JIS Z2382
As shown in Fig.1, the type of JIS Z2382 ABS collector
is composed of 10cm x 10cm gauze, which is clipped in
hollow acrylic frame. This apparatus is so simple that the
was installed at Port 1 of Kaohsiung Harbor for collecting
on-site wind velocity, wind direction, temperature,
humidity and rainfall data. Moreover, the weather
information at Nanje, Shougan, Jouin, Chenjin, Linyuan,
Chaotou, Poje, Shinin, Annan, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Younkan,
Shanhua and Jyugin were purchased from Central Weather
Bureau of Taiwan. By interpolating all purchased weather
information, all weather information at the on-site ABS
collectors can be estimated. However, during the sorting of
the weather information, it was found that there was high
peak of rainfall and wind velocity due to typhoon invasion
between 2007.07 and 2007.08. In order to distinguish the
influence of the typhoon on air-borne salt, the weather
information during 2007.07 and 2007.08 were separated
with the weather information during other observation
period.
3.3.1 Rainfall
If excluding the influence of typhoon invasion, the
dependency of ABS on the recorded rainfall can be given in
Fig.7. For PWRI collector on ABS, with the increase of
rainfall, there is moderate raise of ABS. If the rainfall due
to typhoon is included, as shown in Fig.8, it is obvious that
there is clear dependency of ABS on the rush of rainfall.
On the other hand, for JIScollector on ABS, with the
increase of rainfall, the collected ABS showed the decrease
tendency. Especially, when the rainfall is over 300mm, the
ABS collected by JIS type is almost close to zero. In order
to clarify the effect of rainfall on ABS for different type of
collector, the correlation of ABS on type of collectors at
port 10 of Kaohsiung harbor was further investigated with
the reference to the rainfall amount collected on port 10 of
Kaohsiung harbor, which are illustrated in Fig.9. As shown
in Fig.9, the distribution of ABS collected by PWRI
collector within 18 months at port 10 of Kaohsiung harbor
since 2007 spring has good agreement with the amount of
rainfall while the distribution of ABS collected by JIS
collector seems no clear relation with the amount of rainfall.
In addition, by excluding the collected ABS on site 1 and 2
due to the existence of weather information, the
comparisons of ABS collected by PWRI and JIS collectors
at the other 10 sites without local weather information were
also given in Fig.10. From Fig.10(a), the ABS collected by
JIS collector at site 9 seems at the highest value within
winter season while this observation is overwhelmingly
counteracted by the huge amount of rainfall caused by
typhoon within summer for the shown ABS value collected
by PWRI collector in Fig.10(b) is found at site 4. As a
result, based on the observations from Fig.7 to Fig.10, it
can be found that the ABS amount of PWRI collector
seems to have direct proportion to the amount of the
environmental rainfall whilst the dependence of ABS
collected by JIS collector cannot be established. Similar
findings have been reported in the research of Tomiita et al.
(1988) and Sakai et al.(1993). For the past researches on
explaining the above ABS variation due to different type of
ABS collectors, washout effectseems to be a good
reason for explaining the huge difference of ABS collection
between PWRI and JIS collector. However, such kind of
simplified inference may brought into possible
mis-interpretations for the past site ABS collection. It may
hold that, since the washout effect is obvious for the large
rainfall, the collected data for PWRI is certainly larger than
it should be for the real RC structure. Therefore, the
anticorrosion design for airborne salt according to the data
of PWRI should be conservative due to washout effect.
However, it may be wrong for the low value of ABS
collected by PWRI because there may be high ABS value
for JIS collector, as shown in the case (site 9) of Fig.10.
3.3.2 Temperature
As shown in Fig.11, it seems quite obscure for the
dependency of ABS on temperature, either for PWRI type
or for JIS type.
3.3.3 Humidity
As shown in Fig.12, it can be found that there is
bell-type distribution of ABS along the increase of
humidity, either for PWRI type or for JIS type, which
means the accumulation of ABS due to humidity on the
surface of the collector will grow up to certain limit; then,
owing to the weight of ABS and the formation of water
drop on the surface of the collector, the fall of water drop
will bring down the accumulated ABS.

prove the idea by treating the surface of cementitious material as the first resistance line for
invasive material, which may be related to concrete quality in some sense. The authors define one
surface material parameter as surface characteristic pore (rc) , the dimension of which can be
utilized as the judgement of safety and durability index, although rc should be treated as nominal
pore parameter. Through combining the theories on diffusivity of gaseous component and fluid
within porous media, the authors proposed one surface-characteristic-pore model using composite
surface-contact NDT techniques ,i.e. ultrasonic wave, dynamic resonance and TORRENT air
permeability. Based on the comparison of the experimental and literature data, the availability of
the proposed model shows its feasibility on correlating concrete quality with durability. Based
on the findings of this research, the long-term safety of concrete structure may be more reliably
judged with the propsed model.
2. SURFACE-CHARACTERISTIC-PORE MODEL (SCP MODEL)
As known, the cementitous material is characterized as its interconnected pores. Thus, not only
the safety issue related to strength but also the issue if the concrete is durable are increasingly key
concerns for applying NDT on evaluating concrete structures. Especially, the consensus
that ,even there exist various degradation mechanizm of concrete under different exposure
environment, the durability of concrete can be directly related to the permeability of concrete is
being shaped. In other word, to investigate permeability of concrete is to realize the durability of
concrete, as illustrated in Fig.1.
Fig.1- Relationship between durability and
porosity of concrete
Based on this recognizition, this research
adopts composite NDT (surface-contact)
techniques to collect related parameters for
calculating the representative pore parameters ,
which are regarded as the correlative factors
to durability of concrete, as quality index of
concrete. In the following, the relationship
for all the collected NDT parameters with SCP
model is explained.Based on the relationship
of pulse wave velocity and the fluid behaviour,
the elastic modulus of mortar (or paste) can be
expressed in Eq.(1).

Where E： the elastic modulus of mortar (or
paste) (Gpa)；E0： the elastic modulus of
zero-pores hardened mortar (or paste)(Gpa) ；
Pp：the porosity of mortar (or paste)；c：empirical constant. Becasue the properties ,types and
amount of paste or aggregate may influence the elastic modulus, it can be regarded as the
influence of pore structures on Poisson ratio. Eq.(1) can be re-expressed as

replacement ratio (adding slag); the curing condition is considered by standard curing,
Rh60% curing and indoor air curing, where is tabulated in Table 1 (L9(34) orthogonal

ratio 0.3, 0% slag replacement ratio and standard curing while 410C means
water/cement ratio 0.4, 10% slag replacement ratio and indoor air curing. Besides the
aforementioned 3 kinds of NDT techniques are used in measuring the required
parameters, compressive strength, porosity and chloride diffusivity are individually
obtained for the comparison. Here, the chloride diffusivity is obtained by carrying out
rapid chloride migration method proposed in JTG/T B07-01-2006 [10]. By
substituing the experimental parameters into Eq.(14), the surface characteristic pore
can be calculated.

11
1. From the experimental comparisons in this research, 4 μm of surface
characteristic pore size shows its availability on the good link either with
strength index or with diffusivity index.
2. With introducing surface characteristic pore as quailty index, the quality of
concrete structure can be judged more comprehensively because the strength
index in this research shows its inefficiency with different curing conditions.
3. Although the availability of SCP model is validated at laboratory experiment,
further tests like Mercury-intrusion porosity at the zone of near-surface
concrete and direct comparisons on site concrete should be carried out for
ascertaining the practical application of SCP model.
