transfer function using the approach similar to digital communications. Our 
approach is to vary the time period between the on/off intervals of an fMRI 
experiment and create an irregular stimulating input. Therefore, a PN signal is 
passing into brain. From the resulting output, we will use minimum mean square 
error (MMSE) approach to estimate the transfer function of acupuncture and 
determine whether the DeQi effect has a longer tail in its impulse response. 
3. 文獻探討 
The earliest works in studying acupuncture using fMRI were done by Alavi 
[4] and followed by Cho [5]. Cho et. al.’s work was the first to identify that 
specific areas of the visual cortex appeared to be activated in response to acupoint 
UB67 in the same way as it responds to a simulation from a light source shone 
into the eyes. Then, Lee et. al. [6] and Li et. al. [7] produced similar findings that 
supported Cho’s hypothesis. Li et. al. [8] also studied SJ8 and Du15 which are 
specific to language and observed similar phenomenon. Yoo et. al. [9] noted that 
PC6 response in nausea. Yan et. al. [10] studied LI4 and Liv3. There were also 
several studies on analgesia and acupuncture [11-17]. However, with the 
abundance of literatures relating acupoints to specific brain regions, there has not 
yet been any study on the transfer function of acupuncture using fMRI. 
4. 研究方法 
In this project, we did two sets of experiments. The first was a 
psychophysical experiment that tested the subjective sensation of the long-term 
effect of acupuncture. The second was the fMRI experiment. Every subject was 
punctured at Chong-Yang acupoint on the left foot. Three block-design fMRI 
scans were performed. Each scan included two on/off tests. Therefore, there were 
6 tests overall. We then compared these 6 tests. 
5. 結果與討論 
Since we were interested in the long-term effect of acupuncture, the 6 tests 
we obtained from the subject can be divided into 3 groups. Each group had two 
sets of fMRI data. The first data set corresponded to the situation where there is no 
prior stimulation. The second data set corresponded to the situation where there is 
prior stimulation. Figures 1 and 2 showed the data analysis from the first and the 
second data set.
