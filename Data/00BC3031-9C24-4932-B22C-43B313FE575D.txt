Abstract 
In this research we study the instability of 
biped robots that is a combination of both 
sliding and tipping over. Specifically, when 
robot falling occurs, the ground reaction forces 
and moments on a foot may determine if sliding 
also happens. We deal with the situation that 
tipping over is impending, and treat the 
following three possible types of contact stress 
distribution on the foot: point contact, line 
contact, and area contact. In line and area 
contact regions we assume that normal stresses 
are Hertzian, then tangential stresses may be 
determined by utilizing theory of instantaneous 
center of zero velocity in planar kinematics. 
From these normal and tangential stresses we 
may determine force combinations that cause 
sliding.

pure translation. The corresponding sliding of the foot does not 
include rotation, hence is not a general plane motion. To 
include rotation of a foot about an axis normal to the surface 
during sliding, Coulomb’s law of friction should be used on 
tractions (surface stresses) at every point in the contact region 
[15], so that friction moment about the axis of rotation will 
appear, and except for a short section on point contact, in this 
study Coulomb’s law of friction is utilized this way. 
Besides pure sliding and pure tipping, another instability 
mode is a combined motion of both sliding and tipping. 
Analysis on pure sliding can only be performed when the 
normal pressure distribution between the foot and the ground is 
known, or at least can be found in the analysis. The foot-to-
ground contact is conformal, meaning the contact area is as 
large as the bodies in contact, and in such a case the pressure 
distribution can only be found by a numerical technique. In this 
study we focus on the simpler case, that is, the instability is a 
combination of both sliding and tipping [16]. As the foot is just 
about to turn, the contact area reduces to a much smaller 
region. We assume that at this instant the Hertz contact theory 
is valid, thus the normal pressures are given by analytical 
expressions. As sliding is also about to occur, the magnitude 
and the direction of tangential stress may be determined by 
using Coulomb’s law of friction and theory of instantaneous 
center of zero velocity, respectively [16], as we will show 
below. Hence tangential stress distributions are also given by 
analytical expressions. The purpose of this paper is to obtain 
the resultant forces which cause a combination of both sliding 
and tipping. Numerical calculations only appear in the 
integration and in determining the contact ellipse. 
The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly it 
suggests a procedure to obtain force combinations that cause a 
biped robot to reach critical conditions. Secondly, since this is 
the first instability analysis that includes general sliding, we 
treat the simplified cases which can be used later by analysis 
involving more sophisticated numerical techniques, such as 
finite element methods, as test cases to check results. 
HERTZ CONTACT THEORY 
Subsequent analysis is performed using Hertz contact 
pressure and a brief review of Hertz contact theory is given as 
follows. Two convex bodies initially touch at a point, called the 
initial contact point. Under the action of a normal force F, a 
contact region develops at this point. The Hertz theory is based 
on the following four assumptions: (1) Two bodies in contact 
are made of isotropic materials, they have linearly elastic 
stress-strain relations, and their strains are small. (2) Closed to 
the initial contact point, the local geometry of the two bodies 
can be approximated by quadratic surfaces. Hence the 
maximum and the minimum principal radii exist on two planes 
passing through the initial contact point. (3) The contact region 
is small compared to any characteristic length of the two bodies 
such that it can be bounded by a plane. (4) The surfaces are 
smooth and frictionless. Under these assumptions the contact 
region is found to be an ellipse whose half lengths a and b 
along the major and the minor axes may be determined by the 
following procedure [17-20]. 
(1) Two constants A and B are determined as follows

In the last equation υi and Ei are Poisson’s ratio and modulus of 
elasticity for body i (i=1 or 2), respectively. The pressure 
distribution will be given later in Eq. (24). 
A special case is a circular cylinder lying statically on a 
flat surface, compressed by a pressure that is uniformly 
distributed along the longitudinal axis of the cylinder. The 
pressure is normal to both the flat surface and the longitudinal 
axis. In this case the contact region is a rectangle [17-20], and 
the pressure distribution is also given later in Eq. (11). 
Hertz pressure is obtained under the assumption of 
frictionless contact, but when the two bodies in contact are 
elastically identical, that is, they have identical elastic 
constants, then the presence of tangential friction stresses does 
not affect the conformity of contact. In such a case the normal 
Hertz pressure and the size of the contact region are unaffected 
by tangential stresses ([17], p.203). As for contacts of two 
bodies with different elastic constants, Johnson, based on the 
research by Bufler [21], noted that the effect of tangential 
stresses on the Hertz pressure is small even in extreme cases, 
and generally the effect is negligible ([17], pp. 209). The 
interference on normal Hertz pressure from the tangential 
stresses is neglected in subsequent analysis.

In this equation d is length of the strip shown in Fig. 2. 
If sliding is also impending, this sliding will be a planar 
motion on the surface of the ground. According to planar 
kinematics, there exists an instantaneous center of zero velocity 
I(ξ,η) so that the impending motion is a rotation about this 
center. Figure 3(a) shows the contact strip of Fig. 2. The 
velocity vP at a point P(x,y) in contact strip is the tangential 
velocity of the impending rotation about I(ξ,η), hence it is 
normal to the line segment IP. Since the tangential stress vector 
Tt, also called tangential traction, opposes this impending 
planar motion, at the point P the direction of this stress on the 
foot is along the direction of −vP. In figure 3(a) we show the 
equal but opposite stress on the ground, it acts in the same 
direction with vP. Expression for velocity vP is not unique, in 
addition to a single rotation about I, vP for the impending planar 
motion can be expressed as a sum of translation and a rotation, 
as follows 
BPωvv ×+= BP                   (13) 
where ω is the angular velocity of the impending rigid body 
motion, and vB is velocity of the zero moment point B shown in 
figures 2 and 3. Since ZMP is also the pressure center [2,4], for

the contact region shown in Fig. 2, this point is the centroid of 
the contact strip, that is, xB = a−w and yB =(L1− L2 −R1)/2. The 
first and second terms to the right hand side of Eq. (13) 
correspond to a rigid body translation with the velocity vB, and 
the rigid body rotation about B with the angular velocity ω, 
respectively, as figures 3(b) and 3(c) show. The tangential 
traction produced by the rigid body translation shown in Fig. 
3(b) has a resultant force Ft, whose x and y components are Fx 
and Fy, and according to the definition of ZMP, the traction 
resultant pass through the zero moment point B. For the rigid 
body rotation shown in Fig. 3(c), the resultant of the tangential 
traction distribution on the ground is a pure couple MBz, called 
friction moment. The moment MBz is related to the moment Mz 
about O by the relation 
yBxBzBz FxFyMM −+=               (14) 
Tangential forces Fx, Fy and friction moment MBz determine if 
sliding occur. In the previous case of rigid body point contact 
(section 3), there is no contact region on which tangential 
traction acts, hence MBz = 0 and the impending rigid body 
motion is caused by Fx and Fy only. Therefore for a case of 
point contact the corresponding sliding is always a pure 
translation. 
The purpose now is to determine all combinations of (Fx, 
Fy, MBz) that make sliding impending when the foot is about to 
turn about a line. When sliding is impending, according to 
Coulomb’s law of friction the tangential traction vector Tt at an 
arbitrary point P(x,y) in the contact strip, shown in Fig. 3, has 
the magnitude μ⎥Tz⎜. Also, Tt and its components Tx, Ty form a 
triangle that is similar to triangle IPQ. Thus we may write

it needs the largest Ty (hence fy) to reach a mBz; this results very 
slender contours. By the same argument we may understand 
contours in Fig. 5 are less slender, because this is the case with 
the largest a/d ratio. 
 
Figure 8 The region of moments (Mx , My) for sliding to be 
possible when the foot is about to turn about its left 
edge. 
 
If the foot has a negligible height h ≈ 0, then according to 
Eqs. (6) and (7) moments Mx and My are given by 
zBByx FxyMM ),(),( −=            (22) 
Note that although equations (6) and (7) were obtained for the 
case of point contact, they are still valid in line contact if xB and 
yB are considered as coordinates of the ZMP, and this 
corresponds to the situation that traction distribution being 
replaced by the resultant force F at the ZMP. Moments Mx and 
My are responsible for turning of the foot about a line such as 
the left edge. Equation (22) suggests that the moments Mx and 
My that make turning about to happen are independent of 
tangential forces Fx, Fy and frictional moments MBz. In other 
words impending tipping over and impending sliding are 
separable. However, if the foot has a considerable height h, 
then Eqs. (6) and (7) show that Fx and Fy may influence Mx and 
My; meaning that tipping and sliding are inseparable. Figure 8 
shows results for the contact region with the dimensions d = 
1.5w, a = 0.2w, and the height h=0.4w. The curves were 
obtained by fixing a value of ξ (or η) while η (or ξ) was 
changing from −∞ to ∞. Tangential forces Fx and Fy were 
obtained by numerically integrating the integrals in Eqs. (17) 
and (18), and Eq. (12) gives the normal force to be Fz = 
πadT0/2. Figure 8 shows that Mx and My are limited to a region. 
If sliding also occurs during tipping over, turning moments Mx 
and My must lie within this region. 
 
AREA CONTACT 
 In the case of point contact as shown in Fig. 1, 
generally a contact region develops around the initial contact 
point B. According to Hertz contact theory, the contact region is 
an ellipse as shown in Fig. 9. We call the foot body 1 and the

represented by a case of point contact of a rigid foot. 
Substituting Eq. (25) into Eq. (9), we again obtain Eq. (21), but 
the radius r = 2πab/(3w2). The radius of each boundary contour 
mBz = 0 in figures 11-13 agrees with the value calculated using 
this expression. Figure 11 is for the case point B is the upper 
most point of the foot shown in Fig. 1, that is, θ1 = π/2. The 
major and minor axes of the contact ellipse are parallel to the x 
and the y axes, respectively. In figure 12, B is the point on the 
upper right boundary with θ1 = π/4 in Fig. 1. The two ellipses 
for cases shown in figures 11 and 12 have the same half lengths 
a and b, but the ellipse for Fig. 12 is similar to the one shown 
in Fig. 10, which makes an angle of π/4 to the ellipse for Fig. 
11. Hence each contour in Fig. 12 may be obtained from its 
corresponding contour in Fig. 11 by a clockwise rotation of an 
angle of π/4. Figure 13 shows the case when B is located at the 
lower left corner, with θ2 = 5π/4 in Fig. 1. As in the case of line 
contact, if the height h of the foot is negligible, then the turning 
moment Mx and My are independent of tangential forces Fx and 
Fy, and the two types of impending motion: tipping over and 
sliding, are separable. Figure 14 shows the results for a foot 
with a significant height, i.e. h=0.4w, and they are obtained by 
the same procedure as the one in drawing Fig. 8. If sliding also 
occurs during tipping over, then Mx and My must lie within the 
closed region shown in Fig. 14. 
In any of the contour plots given in figures 4-7 and 
figures 11-13, the surface is steepest, i.e. mBz increases most

rapidly, on the boundary mBz = 0, and the surface becomes more 
and more flat toward the center where mBz = (mBz)max. This also 
occurs in all contour plots given previously by Liu and Paul 
[15]. Before this phenomenon is discussed in detail in the next 
paragraph, we should first notice the difference between two 
arbitrary points in a contour plot, as explained below. Although 
every point in a contour plot corresponds to a situation of fully 
developed sliding, that is, the magnitude of tangential traction
