Abstract 
This study applies a modified cascaded fuzzy reasoning 
Petri net (CFRPN) model to analyze dangerous driving 
events on a freeway. The dangerous driving events can be 
divided into two groups: (1) the interaction between a 
driver’s vehicle and the road environment, and (2) the 
interaction between a driver’s vehicle and nearby vehicles. 
These two classes of driving events may occur 
simultaneously and lead to certain serious traffic situations. 
The proposed system analyzes these two kinds of events 
determines dangerous situations from data collected by 
various sensors. Since collecting real driving event data on 
freeway is dangerous and time consuming, a data generation 
system is developed to generate the experimental data. Such 
data can help evaluate the performance of the proposed 
analysis system. Finally, experimental results show that the 
proposed system is accurate and robust. 
Keywords：Active driver assistance system, driving event 
analysis, fuzzy reasoning Petri net 
1. Introduction 
Diverse methods for enhancing driving safety have 
been proposed. Such methods can be roughly classified as 
passive or active. Passive methods (e.g., seat-belts, airbags, 
and anti-lock braking systems), which have significantly 
reduced traffic fatalities, were originally introduced to 
diminish the degree of injury from an accident. By contrast, 
active methods are designed to prevent accidents from 
occurring. Driver assistance systems (DAS) [Sch00] are 
designed to bring to alert the driver as quickly as possible to 
a potentially dangerous situation.  
Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of a DAS, which 
can be split into two major components, for detection and 
analysis. The systems included in the detection component 
are used to collect the relevant data. These data can be 
obtained by various equipments, such as visual sensors, 
infrared ray sensors, laser sensors, ultrasonic wave sensors, 
ladar sensors and global positioning systems (GPS). Other 
sensors are adopted to detect the driver’s stress and 
drowsiness. Many researchers have developed detection 
systems to collect data accurately and quickly from these 
sensors. However, these detection systems generally work 
independently of each other. Few researchers [Mit03] are 
interested in integrating the high-level, abstract information 
from the collected data, for example to determine whether 
dangerous driving events occur. Furthermore, since every 
sensor has its limitations, we believe that integrating the 
detection results from different systems can improve the 
accuracy and efficiency of understanding driving situations. 
This study proposes a dangerous driving event analysis 
system to integrate the outputs from detection systems, and 
thus obtain some reasonable conclusions about the degree of 
danger in the driving environment.

Step 4: If kk θθ ≠+1  or kk γγ ≠+1 , then let 1+= kk , 
and return to Step 3; otherwise, the reasoning is 
over. 
3.2 Using FRPNs for Reasoning 
This study presents a three-stage CFRPN to analyze the 
dangerous driving events. The first stage of CFRPN uses 
FRPNs to reason straightforward driving events, such as the 
relative lane change (or speed) between a nearby vehicle 
and ours. Examples of such events include “the left forward 
vehicle and our vehicle are moving to the same lane” and 
“the right vehicle and our vehicle are moving on the 
different lanes.”  
In the second stage, FRPNs are utilized to reason more 
complex driving events. FRPNs can evaluate the degree of 
danger between a single nearby vehicle and ours. For 
example, “Will any dangerous driving event occur between 
the right vehicle and our vehicle.” In the third stage, FRPNs 
integrate the outputs from the FRPNs in the second stage to 
make a final conclusion on whether a dangerous driving 
event occurs in the entire driving environment. 
The proposed dangerous driving event analysis system 
only deals with motion of vehicles close to the driver’s 
vehicle. Therefore, eight neighboring vehicles positions are 
defined as forward, backward, left, right, left forward, left 
backward, right forward and right backward. The 
relationship between each neighborhood vehicle and our 
vehicle is reasoned by two FRPNs, one for relative lane 
change and the other for relative speed. Therefore, the first 
stage of CFRPN requires 16 FRPNs. 
First, the relative lane change relationship is determined 
by one of the eight FRPNs. The terms )( 11 θp , )( 22 θp , 
)( 33 θp , )( 44 θp , )( 55 θp , )( 66 θp , )( 77 θp , and )( 88 θp  
are defined as follows: 
(1) )( 11 θp : The driver’s vehicle moves without lane change. 
(2) )( 22 θp : The driver’s vehicle changes to the left lane. 
(3) )( 33 θp : The driver’s vehicle changes to the right lane. 
(4) )( 44 θp : The left-forward vehicle moves without 
changing lane. 
(5) )( 55 θp : The left-forward vehicle changes to the left 
lane. 
(6) )( 66 θp : The left-forward vehicle changes to the right 
lane. 
(7) )( 77 θp : The left-forward vehicle and ours are moving in 
the same lane. 
(8) )( 88 θp : The left-forward vehicle and ours are moving in 
different lanes. 
The previous six places, 621 ,...,, ppp , express the 
premises, and the following two ones, 7p  and 8p , 
express the consequences of rules. The FRPN in Fig. 6 can 
be adopted to reason the following two production rules 
comprising these premises and consequences.  
(1) )())()(())()(( 7744226611 θθθθθ ppppp →∧∨∧

→∧∨

The first production rule derives the possibility that the 
left-forward vehicle and the driver’s vehicle are moving on 
the same lane, while the second rule derives the possibility 
that the left-forward vehicle and the driver’s vehicle are 
moving on different lanes. A result of 87 θθ >  reveals the 
first event has a larger probability of occurring than the 
second event. Furthermore, the confidence values of the 
transitions in the FRPN may be associated with the 
significance of the corresponding terms in the production 
rules.  
Second, one of the eight FRPNs is depicted to derive 
the relative vertical distance relationship. Let Vo denote our 
vehicle, and Vlf  be our left-forward vehicle. The terms 
)'(' 11 θp , )'(' 22 θp , )'(' 33 θp , )'(' 44 θp , )'(' 55 θp , 
)'(' 66 θp , and )'(' 77 θp  can then be defined as follows: 
(1) )'(' 11 θp : The vertical distance between Vo and Vlf is 
close. 
(2) )'(' 22 θp : The speed of Vo is slower than that of Vlf. 
(3) )'(' 33 θp : The speeds of Vo and Vlf are equal. 
(4) )'(' 44 θp : The speed of Vo is faster than that of Vlf. 
(5) )'(' 55 θp : The vertical distance between Vo and Vlf  
increases. 
(6) )'(' 66 θp : The vertical distance between Vo and Vlf 
remains the same. 
(7) )'(' 77 θp : The vertical distance between Vo and Vlf  
decreases. 
The previous four places, 421 ',...,',' ppp , represent the 
premises, and the following three places, 65  , pp  and 7'p , 
represent the consequences of the rules. The FRPN shown 
in Fig. 7 can lead to the following production rules.  
process is )',','( 765 θθθ  = (0.002, 0.0, 0.953). Finally, 
these two output vectors can be combined as one input 
vector of the FRPN shown in Fig. 8 in the second stage of 
the CFRPN, and the output vector is )(θ  = (0.724). This 
value is sufficiently large to demonstrate that the motions 
between the left forward vehicle and our vehicle are 
dangerous.  
Table 1 summarizes the experimental results of the 
degree of danger of the motions between the vehicle ahead 
Va and the driver’s Vo. Column 2 lists the relative speeds, 
obtained by subtracting the speed of Va from that of Vo, 
column 3 lists the vertical distances between Vo and Va, and 
columns 4 and 5 shows the horizontal shifts of Vo and Va. 
The value of the horizontal shift is positive if a vehicle 
changes its lane to the left, and negative if a vehicle changes 
its lane to the right. Finally, column 6 presents the degrees 
of danger. 
According to this table, the degree of danger is largest 
if the relative speed is negative (see Table 1, rows 6, 7, 8, 
and 9), implying that the vehicle ahead is moving slower 
than the driver’s vehicle. In these cases, a closer vertical 
distance between Vo and Va implies a greater danger. For 
instance, the degree of danger is 0.261 when the distance is 
50m, and rises to 0.902 when the distance falls to 10m. 
Comparing the data on rows 7 and 8 reveals that the 
horizontal shifts of vehicles affect the degree of danger 
slightly. 
5. Conclusions and Future Work 
This study presents a CFRPN model to analyze the 
dangerous driving events on a freeway. Our system can 
analyze the driving events and output a degree of danger, 
which indicates whether the driver is in danger in the 
currently driving environment. 
Since obtaining the real data of the dangerous driving 
events is dangerous and time-consuming, a data generation 
system is also presented to generate the experimental data. 
These data are useful for measuring the performance of the 
dangerous driving event analysis system. However, the data 
generation system only generates partial driving events on  
freeway driving environment. This data generation system 
will be further improved continuously. 
We believe that if the system can refer not only to the 
spatial information but also to the temporal information in 
the data sequences, then it could predict dangerous driving 
events and alarm the driver as early as possible in the future.
