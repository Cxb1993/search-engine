1. Introduction 
Logistics companies around the world have increased their competitiveness and 
experienced fast growth through the adaptation of mathematical modeling techniques 
for optimizing vehicle routes. The existing scenarios that logistics companies may face 
vary, and new scenarios keep generating. As a result, both researchers and practitioners 
are striving to find the best way to tackle different scenarios. 
Motivated by high land prices and narrow roads, new kinds of delivery services 
operated by Black Cat-Takkyubin and DHL, logistics companies in Taiwan, have been 
observed. The Black Cat-Takkyubin dispatches a large vehicle to deliver commodities 
to the chosen customers who provide sufficient parking spaces and wide access roads. 
For customers who cannot be easily accessed by large vehicles due to inaccessible roads 
or lack of parking spaces, delivery service is provided by smaller vehicles, i.e., bicycles 
or motorcycles. The small vehicle driver can be the same driver of the large vehicle or a 
different person. In the former case, the driver changes the transportation mode only at 
certain linehaul-feeder locations and then switches back. At linehaul-feeder locations, 
the large vehicle parks in a legal space, and then the parked small vehicle is used to 
continue delivery. Using this method, every customer can receive door-to-door service. 
Using a similar delivery method, DHL simultaneously dispatches both large and small 
vehicles from the PD for commodity delivery. When their commodity load is empty, 
small vehicles visit the larger vehicle to reload. 
In the US, a related delivery operation can also be observed through mail delivery. 
A postman is usually assigned to an area where he or she drives along a pre-specified 
route, making several stops. At each stop, the driver exits the truck and delivers the 
mails by walking. When delivery is complete, the driver goes back to the main postal 
office. 
The common attributes with the aforementioned practices are that two types of 
transportation modes (i.e., large and small) are used for servicing two types of 
customers (i.e., type-I and type-II). The classification of customers is mainly based on 
the parking conditions and the accessibility for large vehicles. Type-I customers can be 
serviced by both large and small vehicles whereas type-II customers can only be 
serviced by small vehicles. Small vehicles, which have load capacity limitations, can 
reload from large vehicles, which are staying at “virtual depots” (VDs). The VD is 
different from the physical depot (PD) in that it is not privately owned but can be used 
by both large and small vehicles at no or affordable costs. This reduces the number of 
side trips to and from the PD for reloading and could result in sufficient cost savings. 
From the entrepreneur’s point of view, PD is certainly more controllable than VD. 
However, due to high land prices, it is difficult for logistics companies to increase the 
 4
VDs; the products are directly transshipped from a large vehicle to one or more empty 
or near-empty smaller vehicles. A near-empty small vehicle is hereafter defined as a 
small vehicle at which the remaining load is not enough to fulfill the demand of the next 
customer along the scheduled route. Hence the vehicle needs reloading before 
performing further services. Although the concept of cross docking is related to VD, the 
latter is more difficult, because the number of VDs and their locations in a system may 
not be specified and must be determined each time that a delivery operation is 
performed. 
When a VD is used for vehicles to clear their load, it can be thought of as the 
landfill in the garbage truck routing problem with time windows (GTRPTW). The 
GTRPTW problem is defined as finding a route that minimizes total travel cost when 
performing garbage collections at pre-specified stops, subject to the time constraints. 
When a truck is full en route, it should find a landfill to clear the load, i.e., make a 
garbage disposal trip, before continuing its work. Each truck may need to make multiple 
disposal trips in a day. When a truck has serviced all of its customers, it must dump the 
garbage, even if the load is not full, before returning to the depot. Several papers have 
proposed workable solution algorithms that embed meta-heuristics for solving the 
GTRPTW problem (Sahoo et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2004, 2006; Del Pia and Fillippi, 
2006; Chen and Wang, 2008). 
The concept of the linehaul-feeder vehicle routing problem with pre-specified 
virtual depot (LFVRP-PVD) was first identified by Tu et al. (2001) and Chang et al. 
(2001). The LFVRP-PVD delivers lunch boxes to all customers using two sizes of 
vehicles. The empty or near-empty small vehicles can detour to the large vehicle 
situated at the pre-specified single VD for reloading. However, no numerical data were 
provided. Chang (2006) subsequently extended this work, renaming it the 
linehaul-feeder vehicle routing problem (LFVRP), and proposed a two-stage solution 
heuristics. In the first stage, the nearest neighbor method is employed to construct initial 
routes while in the second stage the initial solution is improved using the node exchange 
method. Computational experiments are extensively conducted using simplified 
numerical data obtained from an international express delivery company in Taiwan.. 
Seven strategies for determining the single VD are compared in terms of total travel 
costs. 
The common drawback associated with the LFVRP-PVD and LFVRP is the lack of 
flexibility due to pre-specified VDs. This strict assumption has been relaxed by Chen et 
al. (2008), resulting in a research named linehaul-feeder vehicle routing problem with 
virtual depots (LFVRP-VD). To solve the LFVRP-VD, two heuristics were proposed. 
Seventeen test problems, modified from a set of classical VRP benchmark situations, 
were extensively examined. The results show that the heuristic that embeds the

Figure 2 depicts the time windows associated with each customer and illustrates 
how the large and small vehicles move on the time-space diagram. The PD, two 
non-VD type-I customers (nodes a and c), two VDs (nodes b and d) and eleven type-II 
customers (nodes 1 through 11) are on the x axis. The y axis indicates the time of day. 
The time window for customer 9 is [12,17], which is denoted by a pair of triangles. 
Each customer is serviced by a vehicle within it’s time window. The trajectories for the 
large and two small vehicles are represented by bold arrows, thin arrows and dash 
arrows, respectively. Small vehicle 1 departs from the PD at 8:00am via intermediate 
nodes 2, 3, d, 7, 9, and 10 and returns around 16:00 pm. Small vehicle 2 departs from 
the PD at 11:00 am via intermediate nodes, c, 1, d, 4, 5, a, b, 6, 8, and 11 and returns 
around 20:00 pm. The travel time between nodes 2 and 3 by small vehicle 1 are 
represented by 23t  and the service time needed at node 3 is denoted by 3s . The time 
that the large vehicle remains at VD b is denoted by bp . Note that the waiting time for 
the large vehicle can be found by the length of stay minus the total time for reloading 
the small vehicles and servicing at the VD itself.

5. A chosen VD is used for reloading and each VD can be visited more than once by 
large and/or small vehicles. 
6. The large vehicle, in addition to serving VD customers, provides reloading service 
for empty or near-empty small vehicles. 
7. Empty or near-empty small vehicles can reload the commodity from the warehouse 
at the PD or from the large vehicle at VDs when they present at the same time. 
8. The large vehicle will incur waiting cost at a VD for reloading service when it 
arrives earlier than the approaching small vehicles and vice versa. 
9. The cost for reloading each small vehicle and for servicing each customer is known 
and fixed. 
Because of the above complex characteristics, the LFVRPTW is difficult to be 
tackled using the traditional VRP solution algorithm. A new solution algorithm is hence 
proposed. 
 
4 Solution Algorithm 
To solve the LFVRPTW problem a two-stage solution algorithm is proposed. In 
the first stage, initial routes are constructed in Section 4.1; in the second stage, the 
initial solution is improved using the inter-route node exchange method in combination 
with the Tabu search. 
 
4.1 Initial Route Construction 
Initial feasible routes must be constructed for both the large and small vehicles. 
Small vehicles are first routed to service all type-II customers subject to the three 
constraints previously described: customer time window, vehicle capacity, and driver 
awork time limitation. If its loading is empty or near-empty, a small vehicle may choose 
either the PD or a VD for reloading if the corresponding saving is warranted. Consider 
that the VDs that currently perform worse may have chance to outperform in the 
subsequent routes, the second best VD is also taken into account. When small vehicle 
routes are temporary constructed then the large vehicle departs from the PD, services all 
VDs, and returns to the PD. Since reloading operation can be exerted only when both 
the matched small and large vehicles are present, late arrival of the large vehicle may 
affect the subsequent route plan of the matched small vehicle after reloading. If the 
subsequent route plan becomes infeasible, the remaining unsatisfied customers for the 
matched small vehicles after reloading need to be rescheduled. 
The general steps for generating initial routes are described as follows: 
Step 0: Initialization. 
Rank all unserviced customers (including both Type I and Type II) in chronological 
 10
7. Compare the computed insertion cost of the customer among all possible routes, 
and insert the customer into the route with minimum insertion cost. The route 
with the second minimum insertion cost is also recorded for further exploration. 
Remove the inserted customer from the sequence list. 
8. Go back to the PD 
End For 
The insertion cost accrued is computed as follows: 
Insertion cost = (the travel time from the last type-II customer scheduled on the small 
vehicle to the newly scheduled type-II customer) + (the travel time from the newly 
scheduled type-II customer to the PD) - (the travel time between the last type-II 
customer on the small vehicle route and the PD) (2) 
 12
combinations of small vehicle routes generated in Step 1, therefore, each of which 
should be considered for the construction of the large vehicle route. The procedure for 
constructing large vehicle route is described below. 
  
Step 2:Construction of large vehicle route and reschedule the small vehicle routes after 
reloading if necessary. 
For each combination of small vehicle routes, do the following: 
1. Constructing the large tour by connecting all the selected VDs in chronological 
order and go back to the PD. Multiple visits of each VD by the large vehicle is 
allowed if doing so is warranted in terms of total insertion cost. 
2. If late arrival occurs, update the arrival and departure time for all customers in 
the subsequent routes for both large and small vehicle routes. 
3. For the large vehicle route, check each customer in the subsequent route for the 
time window constraint. If the time window constraint is violated, relabel the 
customer as unserviced while keep the large vehicle route unchanged. 
4. For each individual small vehicle route, check each customer in the subsequent 
route for the time window and driver’s work time constraints. If constraint(s) is 
not satisfied, remove the customer from the remaining route and relabel it as 
unserviced. Update the arrival time and departure time of all customers in the 
subsequent route. 
5. For each of unserviced customers, do the following: 
For the large vehicle route as well as each small vehicle route, do the 
following: 
Insert the unserviced customer into the remaining route. If all the 
constraints are satisfied, compute the insertion cost at the insertion 
place. 
End for. 
6. Compute the incurred cost for dispatching a new small vehicle from the PD to 
service the customer. 
7. Compare the computed insertion cost of the customer among all possible routes, 
and insert the customer into the route with minimum insertion cost. Label the 
customer as serviced. 
 
4.2 Improvement of Initial Solution 
The initial solution is usually not optimized. To improve the quality of the initial 
solution, a local search method such as the k-opt exchange method is often used. 
However, due to the complexity of the LFVRPTW problem, this type of methods is not 
ideal, because it is easily trapped within a local region. To move out of the local region

The general information associated with these problems is shown in the following. 
(1) triangular inequality relations of customers distance are held in the network; 
(2) all pairs of customers are connected; 
(3) link travel distances of small vehicles are represented by the Euclidian distance 
between the two customers. 
(4) link travel costs of small vehicles are represented by the corresponding link 
travel distances divided by 40 km/hr; and 
(5) The costs for a large vehicle (1200cc van) include rent and issuance (NTD 
1450/day), fuel cost (NTD 3.3/km), and driver’s wage (NTD 270/hr). Note 
that the exchange rate between the US and New Taiwan Dollars is about 1:32. 
(6) The costs for a small vehicle (125cc motorcycle) consist of rent and issuance 
(NTD 600/day), fuel cost (NTD 0.77/km), and driver’s wage (NTD 120/hr).

Figure 4: Objective Values of Seventeen Examples for LFVRPTW and VRPTW 
  
It is observed that except A64, A80 and C51, the other fourteen examples have 
higher objective value for the LFVRPTW, i.e., worse than the VRPTW. This 
unfavorable outcome for the LFVRPTW is due to inadequate reloading for small 
vehicles and hence the advantage of accommodating VDs is not prominent. 
2. In terms of number of small vehicles: The number of used small vehicles and 
associated reloading for each of seventeen examples are drawn in Figure 5.

5.3 Varying Customer Demands 
Given the other factors unchanged, we vary the demands of customers by a 
multiplier, ranging from 1.1 to 1.9 for seventeen test examples. Most of the test example 
show a similar tendency in terms of objective value: LFVRPTW performs inferior when 
the demand is low but transcend after a break-even point and superior since then. We 
take example A80 for illustration. As shown in Figure 6, the objective value associated 
with LFVRPTW is higher than VRPTW at multipliers of 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. 
However, the LFVRPTW becomes advantageous over VRPTW when the multiplier is 
1.5 or larger.

Figure 6: Objective Value Associated with different Demands for Problem A80 
 
It is also noted that the increments of small vehicles for the LFVRPTW is fewer 
than for the VRPTW as customer’s demands increase (Figure 7). This result also 
indicates the number of small vehicles required for the LFVRPTW is relatively stable 
when customers’ demands increase.

and practical applications worth further exploration. In view of the complexity of 
LFVRPTW, multiple agent meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithm, ant algorithm, 
harmony search method, and water flow-like algorithm may be able to further enhance 
the overall computational efficiency and solution quality. 
For practical applications, additional factors need to be considered, such as soft 
time window constraints, pickup and delivery operations, fixed number of small 
vehicles, and capacity constraint for the large vehicle. In addition, link travel times may 
differ due to traffic, road work, accidents, etc. Therefore, time-dependent, rather than 
fixed, link travel times should be used in real world problem solving. Furthermore, 
customers must be added or canceled in a real-time manner during delivery operation 
because this situation is commonly seen in the real world. 
Finally, as for many other VRP problems, real applications for the LFVRPTW 
problem are essential. In this paper the LFVRPTW did not demonstrate with real-world 
companies such as FedEx, DHL, and Takkyubin-cat because real data are not available 
to us. Nevertheless, this is inevitably an immediate research in the future.
