Abstract 
 
In this study, the densities and the solubilities of CO2 in aqueous Reline solution with different varying mole 
fractions of water at different temperatures are reported. The densities are linear with respect to reline mass 
fraction at each temperature. The logarithms of Henry’s law constants were correlated using the two-suffix 
Margules model. The solubility in reline decreases with increased water content. Hence water can serve as an 
antisolvent to strip CO2 dissolved in reline. The absorption of CO2 in Reline at low pressures is found to be 
endothermic at low water content. However, the absorption becomes exothermic if the water content increases 
to a mole fraction greater than 0.769.

   The experimental procedure, and the method of analysis were same as that reported by Li and Lai46, which 
was similar in principle to the one developed by Haimour and Sandall47.  The apparatus is made up of a 
saturation flask, an 100 ml absorption flask with a magnetic stirrer, and a set of burettes with branches filled 
with mercury and shown on Figure 1.  The system was immersed in a water bath kept at constant 
temperature monitored by a thermometer (CROPICO model 3002 PT100) with an accuracy ± 0.01 oC.  The 
whole apparatus was purged by CO2 for 1 hour before the experiment.  Then the inlet and outlet valves were 
closed.  A known volume of Reline with the specific water content, analyzed by Mettler Toledo Karl Fisher 
titrator model DL31, was injected into the absorption flask.  CO2 and Reline with the specific water content 
was mixed by the magnetic stirrer.  The volume change of the system can be determined by the levels of the 
mercury in the burette.   The system was determined to be in equilibrium after the mercury level remained 
unchanged for 2 hours.  All the experiments at the same conditions were repeated 3-5 times, and the 
reproducibility was estimated within 2 %.

   The solubilities of CO2 in Reline with different water content at 30 oC, 35 oC, and 40 oC were measured

Reline solutions were derived by equation (5) and also listed on the Table 2.  A two-suffix Margules model

4. Summary 
 
   In this study, the densities of Reline/water mixtures and the solubilities of CO2 in Reline with different 
water contents at 30 oC, 35 oC, and 40 oC were measured.  The results showed that CO2 solubility in Reline 
will decrease with increase water content.  Hence, water can serve as an anti-solvent to drive out CO2 
dissolved in Reline.  According to equation (10), the enthalpy of absorption of CO2 in Reline at low pressure 
is endothermic.  This usually implies lack of solvation between solute and solvent and large difference 
between cohesive energy density of the solute and that of the solvent56.  However, using data at high pressure 
( >1 MPa), Li et al. 44 found that the absorption of CO2 is exothermic.  So there must be a crossover point of 
temperature dependence from low to high pressure.  According to equation (10), the absorption of CO2 is
