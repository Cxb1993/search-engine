errors (for example, the item may not be completely failed during the test), and the duartion of
lifetime test cannot be measured precisely under some unexpected situations. In this case, we may
just say that there are “around” s failures during the lifetime test of “around” t time units when
n items are placed on test. Therefore, the failure rate will be termed as “around” s/t. The phrase
“around s/t” can be described by using fuzzy set theory. That is to say, the failure rate λ will
be regarded as a fuzzy real number λ˜ in this case. If the failure time of component is assumed to
have an Exponential distribution E(λ), the component reliability at time t can just say “around”
r = e−λt, i.e., the component reliability is also regarded as a fuzzy real number under this situation.
Similarly, the lifetimes of items sometimes cannot be measured precisely under some unexpected
situations. Therefore, the lifetimes of items will be regarded as fuzzy random variables. We are
going to estimate the fuzzy Bayesian system reliability from the fuzzy component reliabilities.
The reliability analysis is an important research topic in engineering. However, the data some-
times cannot be measured and recorded precisely as described above. Several researchers then pay
attention to applying the fuzzy set theory to reliability analysis. The collection of papers edited by
Onisawa and Kacprzyk [18] gave many different approaches to fuzzy reliability.
In conventional system reliability, we often consider event as {T ≥ t}. Therefore the characteristic
function for set A(t) ≡ {x = T (ω) : T (ω) ≥ t} can be written as
χA(t)(x) =
{
0, x < t
1, x ≥ t .
Huang [8] proposed the fuzzy event “T is fuzzily bigger than t”, denoted as {T  t}, where T is
a random variable for the failure time and “” is in a fuzzy sense. In this case, the characteristic
function χA(t)(x) can be extended to a membership function ξA(t)(x). For example, we can have
ξA(t)(x) =
{
0, x < t
1− e−k(s−t), x ≥ t (for some k > 0).
Let F (x) be the failure distribution function of T . Huang [8] defined the fuzzy reliability as
R˜(t) = P{T  t} =
∫ ∞
0
ξA(t)(x)dF (x)
by using the notion of probability measure of fuzzy event that was proposed by Zadeh [33]. As a
matter of fact, we can see that R˜(t) is a real number for any fixed t (i.e., not a fuzzy real number).
However, we expect that R˜(t) is also a fuzzy real number, which is one of the purpose in this project.
Ramachandran et al. [21] considered the reliability network modeling. They proposed the fuzzy
Markov modeling. Suppose that we have fuzzy components in a reliability network, i.e., the reliability
values of those components are not known precisely. Then we can assign the linguistic variables, e.g.
Low, Medium and High etc., as the reliability values and, finally, we can evaluate the total network
2
for all (x1, x2, · · · , xn) ∈Mn. This combination is suitable for computer calculations connected with
statistical estimation procedures. Another possibility is
ξx˜(x1, x2, · · · , xn) =
n∏
i=1
ξx˜i(xi)
for all (x1, x2, · · · , xn) ∈ Mn. The different combination rules are also motivated by properties of
α-level sets of the fuzzy combined sample element x˜. For more details, we refer to the comments in
Schnatter [23]. The drawback of this method is that it lacks the supporting theory of fuzzy random
variables, since the lifetimes data are assumed as fuzzy observations. On the other hand, the
parameters in their approach are not assumed to be fuzzy parameters, since it will be more natural
to consider the fuzzy estimators when the parameters are in a fuzzy sense. In this project, we are
going to introduce the notion of fuzzy random variables, and also consider the fuzzy parameters.
Cai and Wen [2] introduced the fuzzy success state and fuzzy failure state in which a transition
between two fuzzy states was regarded as a fuzzy event. With the concept of fuzzy reliability, they
made a comparison between two replacement policies, i.e., the block replacement policy under a
nonfuzzy environment and the periodic replacement policy without repair at failures under a fuzzy
environment. In Cai et al. [3], the fuzzy system reliability was established based on the binary state
assumption and possibility assumption. However in Cai et al. [4], the fuzzy system reliability was
established based on the three-state assumption and possibility assumption. In Cai et al. [5], the
fuzzy system reliability was developed based on the basis of fuzzy state assumption and probability
assumption. Cai et al. [6] also discussed the system reliability for coherent system based on the
fuzzy state assumption and probability assumption. Utkin [26, 27] discussed the fuzzy system
reliability based on the binary state assumption and possibility assumption, and considered the
fuzzy availability and unavailability and the fuzzy operative availability and unavailability. Wu [30]
proposed the fuzzy probability to discuss the system reliability in which the functioning probability
of each component in the system was assumed as a nonnegative fuzzy number.
The other interesting articles on human reliability under fuzzy environments can refer to (Liang
& Wang [13]; Onisawa [16, 17]; Rotshtein [22]; Washio & Kitamura [29]), and on using fuzzy logic
approach to reliability models can also refer to (Keller & Kara-Zaitri [9]; Murata [15]; Preyssl &
Nishiwaki [19]; Schneider & Kandel [24]; Xu et al. [31]).
3 Research Methodology
Let a˜ be a fuzzy number. The α-level set of a˜ is denoted it by a˜α =
[
a˜Lα, a˜
U
α
]
. Let X˜ : Ω→ FR be a
fuzzy-valued function. Then X˜ is a fuzzy random variable if and only if X˜Lα and X˜
U
α are (traditional)
random variables for all α ∈ [0, 1].

since the Bayes point estimator of system reliability is the mean of the posterior distribution under
a squared error loss function.
The prior distribution is assigned to each component of a system. Based on test data obtained
from the components, the posterior distributions of each component reliability can be found by
Bayes theorem. In this case, we can derive the posterior distribution of system reliability from the
posterior distributions of component reliabilities. However, the key methodology in such a derivation
is that system reliability can be expressed as a product of independent random variables each of
which corresponds to either component reliability (for series system) or component unreliability (for
parallel system). Therefore we need to invoke the method of Mellin integral transform. We describe
it as follows.
Let X be a nonnegative random variable with p.d.f. f(x). The Mellin transform of f with respect
to the complex parameter u is defined by
M(f ;u) =
∫ ∞
0
xu−1f(x)dx.
It is also convenient to reagrd the Mellin transform as the moments of X, i.e.,
M(f ;u) = E[Xu−1]. (3)
Let X1, X2, · · · , Xk be independent nonnegative random variables with p.d.f.’s f1, f2, · · · , fk, respec-
tively. Let gk(y) be the p.d.f. of the product Y =
∏k
i=1Xi. Springer and Thompson [25] proved
that
M(gk;u) =
k∏
i=1
M(fi;u). (4)
With the help of equation (3), we can obtain the posterior distribution of system reliability from
the posterior distributions of component reliabilities. Then the Bayes point estimator of system
reliability is the mean of the posterior distribution under a squared error loss function, and it can
be obtained from equation (4).
Roughly speaking, the failure rate can be regarded as a quotient s/t, where s is the number of
failures and t is the duration of a lifetime test. Suppose that the number of failures and duration
cannot be recorded or measured precisely due to the human errors, machine errors or some other
unexpected situations. For example, the item may not be completely failed during the test, or some
failed items are not exactly recorded owing to human errors or machine errors. Therefore, in this
case, we may say “around” s failures when n items are placed on test within “around” duration
t time units. That is to say, the failure rate is “around” λ = s/t. In this case, the component
reliability at time t can just say “around” r = e−λt if the failure time of component is assumed
to have an Exponential distribution E(λ). This phrase “around e−λt” can be modeled as a fuzzy
6
When ti is fixed, r(ti) = e−λiti is a monotonically decreasing function of λi. This shows a
one-to-one relationship between ri and λi. Therefore, the unique inverse is given by λi = − ln riti for
0 < ri < 1, ti > 0, and the p.d.f. of Ri = Ri(ti), for fixed ti, is given by
piRi(ri) = piΛi
(− ln ri
ti
) ∣∣∣∣dλidri
∣∣∣∣ = piΛi (− ln riti
)(
1
riti
)
, (8)
Thus the above formula can be used to determine either the prior or posterior distribution of Ri
from the corresponding distribution of Λi. That is to say, if piΛi denotes the corresponding prior
p.d.f. of Λi then piRi denotes the prior p.d.f. of Ri, and if piΛi denotes the corresponding posterior
p.d.f. of Λi then piRi denotes the posterior p.d.f. of Ri (also see Martz and Waller [14]).
Now, according to equations (6) and (8), the prior distribution of Ri is given by
piRi(ri) = piΛi
(
− ln ri
ti
)(
1
riti
)
=
(θi2/ti)θi1 · r(θi2/ti)−1i (− ln ri)θi1−1
Γ(θi1)
,
which is termed as a Negative-Log-Gamma distribution NLG(θi1, θi2/ti). Since we have observedmi
failures at time vi, according to equation (7), the posterior distribution of Λi is G(mi+ θi1, vi+ θi2).
Then, using equation (8) again, the implied posterior distribution of Ri is also a Negative-Log-
Gamma distribution NLG(mi + θi1, (vi + θi2)/ti) and it is given by
piRi(ri|mi, vi) =
[(vi + θi2)/ti]mi+θi1 · r(vi+θi2)/ti−1i (− ln ri)mi+θi1−1
Γ(mi + θi1)
. (9)
From equation (9), the Mellin transform of the posterior p.d.f. of Ri is, by straightforward
integration,
M(piRi(ri|mi, vi);u) =
(
vi + θi2
vi + θi2 + (u− 1)ti
)mi+θi1
, (10)
where Re(u) > 1 − (vi + θi2)/ti. For a series system consisting of k independent components, the
system reliability R is the product of component reliabilities Ri, i.e., R =
∏k
i=1Ri. From equations
(4) and (10), the posterior p.d.f. of the system reliability R at time t (i.e., ti = t for all i = 1, · · · , k),
piR(r|m,v), has Mellin transform given by
M(piR(r|m,v);u) =
k∏
i=1
(
vi + θi2
vi + θi2 + (u− 1)t
)mi+θi1
,
where Re(u) > {1 − (vi + θi2)/t} for all i = 1, · · · , k. The Bayes point estimate of the system
reliability r is the mean of the posterior distribution under a squared error loss function, and it is
given by
rˆ = E[R|m,v] =M{piR(r|m,v);u = 2} =
k∏
i=1
(
vi + θi2
vi + θi2 + t
)mi+θi1
(11)
from equation (3).

3.2 Parallel Systems
Let us consider a parallel system consisting of k independent components, each of which has an
E(λi) lifetime (failure time) distribution for i = 1, · · · , k. For the ith component, suppose that ni
itemss are placed on a lifetime test, and the test is terminated at the time of the mith failure. Under
the same assumptions made above, we can obtain the posterior p.d.f. of unreliability Qi = 1 − Ri
using equation (9) by a change of variable, and it is given by
piQi(qi|mi, vi) =
[(vi + θi2)/ti]mi+θi1 · (1− qi)(vi+θi2)/ti−1(− ln(1− qi))mi+θi1−1
Γ(mi + θi1)
.
From equation (10) by using u = 2 and a change of variable 1− qi = ri, we obtain
E[Qi|mi, vi] = 1−
(
vi + θi2
ti + vi + θi2
)mi+θi1
for all i = 1, · · · , k.
For a parallel system consisting of k independent components, the system reliability is R =
1−∏ki=1(1−Ri), whereRi is the component reliability of the ith component. Equivalently, the system
unreliability Q = 1− R is the product of component unreliabilities Qi = 1− Ri, i.e. Q =
∏k
i=1Qi.
Since the components are independent, for the system unreliability Q, we have
E[Q|m,v] =
k∏
i=1
E[Qi|mi, vi] =
k∏
i=1
[
1−
(
vi + θi2
ti + vi + θi2
)mi+θi1]
.
The Bayes point estimate of system reliability r at time t is the mean E[R|m,v] under a squared
error loss function, and it is given by
rˆ = E[R|m,v] = E[(1−Q)|m,v] = 1− E[Q|m,v] = 1−
k∏
i=1
[
1−
(
vi + θi2
t+ vi + θi2
)mi+θi1]
. (15)
Under the fuzzy assumptions as described above, the Bayes point estimates of r˜Lα and r˜
U
α are,
from equation (15), given by
̂˜rLα = 1− k∏
i=1
1−( ∑mij=1(t˜(ij))Lα + (ni −mi)(t˜(imi))Lα + (θ˜i2)Lα∑mi

and
̂˜rUα = 1− k∏

)mi+(θ˜i1)Uα ,
respectively, for all α ∈ [0, 1]. The membership function of the fuzzy Bayes point estimate of system
reliability r at time t is defined by the same way as discussed above.

notations
Aα = [g(α), h(α)] = [min{g1(α), g2(α)},max{h1(α), h2(α)}] , (16)
where
g1(α) = inf

ξ̂
θ˜
(r) = sup
0≤α≤1
α · 1Aα(r) = sup{α : g(α) ≤ r ≤ h(α), 0 ≤ α ≤ 1}.
Therefore, we need to solve the following type of nonlinear programming problem
max α
subject to min{g1(α), g2(α)} ≤ r
max{h1(α), h2(α)} ≥ r
0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
Now we consider the following four subproblems.
I : max α
subject to g1(α) ≤ r
h1(α) ≥ r
0 ≤ α ≤ 1
II : max α
subject to g1(α) ≤ r
h2(α) ≥ r
0 ≤ α ≤ 1
III : max α
subject to g2(α) ≤ r
h1(α) ≥ r
0 ≤ α ≤ 1
IV : max α
subject to g2(α) ≤ r
h2(α) ≥ r
0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
Let Z∗I , Z
∗
II , Z
∗
III and Z
∗
IV be the objective values of subproblems I, II, III and IV, respectively. Let
Z∗ = max{Z∗I , Z∗II , Z∗III , Z∗IV } and Z∗o be the objective value of the original problem with optimal
solution α∗o (in fact, α
∗
o = Z
∗
o ). Then the following Proposition 4.1 shows that Z
∗ = Z∗o . In other
words, in order to obtain the objective value Z∗o of the original nonlinear programming problem, it
will be enough to just solve the four subproblems I, II, III and IV.
Proposition 4.1 Under the above assumptions and notations, we have Z∗ = Z∗o .
Before providing the numerical example, we introduce a special kind of fuzzy real number. We
say that a˜ is a triangular fuzzy real number if its membership function is given by (the graph of its
membership function will look like a triangle)
ξa˜(r) =
 (r − a1)/(a2 − a1) if a1 ≤ r ≤ a2(a3 − r)/(a3 − a2) if a2 < r ≤ a30 otherwise.
We denote by a˜ = (a1, a2, a3). Then a˜ is a fuzzy real number and its α-level set is given by
a˜α = [(a2 − a1)α+ a1, (a2 − a3)α+ a3] for all α ∈ [0, 1].
12
and
̂˜rUα = ( (25− 5α) + (35− 5α) + (45− 5α) + 7(45− 5α) + 200(25− 5α) + (35− 5α) + (45− 5α) + 7(45− 5α) + 200 + 20
)3+7−α
(
(70− 10α) + (90− 10α) + 6(90− 10α) + 280

)2+5−α

62− 5α

)10−α(49− 4α
50− 4α
)7−α(68− 5α
72− 5α
)4−α
,
respectively, for all α ∈ [0, 1]. We can verify that ̂˜rLα ≥ ̂˜rUα , ̂˜rLα ≥ ̂˜rLβ and ̂˜rUα ≤ ̂˜rUβ for α < β, i.e.̂˜rLα ≤ ̂˜rL1 ≤ ̂˜rU1 ≤ ̂˜rUα . Then Aα in equation (14) can be rewritten as
Aα =
[̂˜rUα , ̂˜rLα] . (17)
Comparing equations (14), (17) and (16), we see that g(α) = g1(α) = ̂˜rUα and h(α) = h2(α) = ̂˜rLα .
Therefore, we just need to solve subproblem II, i.e., Z∗o = Z
∗
II . We see that
̂˜rL1 = ( 5759)9 ( 4546)6 ( 6367)3 =
0.534233 = ̂˜rU1 . Therefore ξ̂r˜(0.534233) = 1. Suppose that we reconsider those fuzzy real numbers
2˜0, 3˜0, 4˜0, 6˜0, 8˜0, 4˜5, 6˜, 4˜ and 2˜ as the real numbers 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 45, 6, 4 and 2, respectively.
Then the Bayes point estimate of system reliability r will be 0.534233. This shows our anticipation
that the Bayes point estimate will have membership degree 1. Since

we are just interested in considering the reliability r ∈ A0. Now we have, for r ∈ A0,
(i) if r < 0.534233 then we solve the problem
ξ̂
r˜

using any commercial optimizers, e.g., GAMS or LINDO. Equivalently, we also can use the Newton
method to solve the following problem
ξ̂
r˜
(r) =
{
α ∈ [0, 1] : α is the root of equation
