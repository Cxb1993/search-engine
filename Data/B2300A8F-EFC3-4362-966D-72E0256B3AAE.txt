Abstract 
Blindly performing carrier phase acquisition and tracking 
without training is a crucial problem, especially when large 
cross quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal 
constellations are used in throughput-efficient high-speed 
communication applications, such as digital TV. This work 
presents an analysis of the performance of oblong QAM 
constellations with an odd number of bits per symbol, to be 
used with the multimodulus algorithm (MMA) for both blind 
equalization and carrier phase recovery. The mathematical 
analysis indicates that it permits much faster phase 
acquisition than its cross counterpart used in MMA without 
requiring additional average transmitted power. This is 
because the average gradient of the cost surface of oblong 
constellation toward global minima is much steeper than that 
of cross constellation. The analysis also demonstrates that the 
MMA using oblong constellations is less likely to be attracted 
to saddle points than MMA using both square and cross 
constellations because the number of saddle points is only half 
of those of the square and cross constellations when adopting 
oblong constellations. This research also investigated and 
analyzed the MMA employing 16-Hexagonal constellations. 
While it appears to be a novel idea to propose the use of 
16-Hexagonal constellation in the MMA, computer 
simulations demonstrated that its performance was not as 
good as that of MMA using the 16-QAM. 
 
Index Terms – Blind equalization, constant modulus

I. INTRODUCTION 
Adaptive channel equalization without a training 
sequence is known as blind equalization [1]–[9]. Consider a 
complex baseband model with a channel impulse response 
of nc . The channel input, additive white Gaussian noise, 
and equalizer input are denoted by ns , nw , and nu , 
respectively. The transmitted data symbols, ns , are 
assumed to consist of stationary independently and 
identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex non-Gaussian 
random variables. The channel is possibly a non-minimum 
phase linear time-invariant filter. The equalizer input, 
 3 
significantly outperform its cross counterpart in the 
recovery of the carrier phase introduced by channels, 
without requiring additional average transmitted power. We 
use the term asymmetric because the oblong QAM is not 
quadrantally symmetric, i.e., 
2 2
, ,[ ] [ ]R n I nE s E s≠ , and as a 
consequence 2[ ] 0nE s ≠ . Although the use of the oblong 
constellation may increase the steady-state symbol-error 
rate (SER) or mean-squared error (MSE) of the adaptive 
equalizer, this work is concerned with the unique feature of 
fast carrier phase recovery associated with the MMA using 
oblong constellations during blind equalization process 
owing to its non-identical nature of the real and imaginary 
parts of the source statistics. 
This research continues the studies of the NSC 
research proposal in the previous year [27] and performs 
computer simulations for DTV channel, followed by an 
investigation of the MMA cost function of 16-Hexagonal 
constellations. 
 
II. CARRIER PHASE TRACKING CAPABILITY 
After some algebraic manipulation, the expansion of 
the MMA cost function in (1) for a complex i.i.d. 
zero-mean QAM source with each member of the symbol 
alphabet being equiprobable, and a complex baseband 
channel excluding additive channel noise, can be written in 
the combined channel-equalizer space nh  as [27]

This section presents that an oblong constellation 
permits much faster phase acquisition and tracking rates 
than a cross constellation, because the shape of the cost 
surface of the oblong constellation inherently has a much 
steeper average slope toward the two global minima than 
the cross constellation. The average slope of the MMA cost 
surface using oblong constellation, in terms of ( )h k  with 
maximum modulus alone, from saddle point [0, ( )]r M−  
toward [ ( ), 0]r M+ , was compared with that of the cross 
constellation from saddle point

r M r M× ×  toward 
[ ( ), 0]r M±  in order to compare their phase tracking speeds. 
This is because the rate of phase tracking hinges on the 
diminishing rate of the imaginary part of ( )h k  with 
maximum modulus, which eventually diminishes to zero 
when the phase rotation is fully recovered. 
 The average slope between two points at [ , ]a b  and 
[ , ]c d  in the MMA cost surface in terms of h(k) with 
maximum modulus alone is defined as

to zero. The ensemble-averaged SER over 10 independent 
runs was used as a performance index shown in Fig. 1 in 
which the symbol duration is 0.093 sµ  as in the ATSC 
DTV standard. 
The MMA using (8 16) oblong× −  displayed a faster 
convergence rate than that of CMA DMD+ , CMA PT+ , 
SCXA, MMA, using the conventional 128-cross and 
CMA PT+ using both 128A-COB and 128C-COB, 
according to Fig. 1. However, the MMA using 
(8 16) oblong× −  yielded a higher steady-state SER than 
that of CMA PT+  and CMA DMD+  using the 
conventional 128-cross because the use of oblong 
constellations generates a higher steady-state MSE than its 
conventional cross counterpart. Notably, the use of MMA 
without requiring a phase rotator such as DMD and PT 
reduces the complexity of the implementation of the 
receiver. Moreover, both DMD and PT yield results with a 
possible ambiguity of 90°  when 128-cross, 128A-COB, 
and 128C-COB are used. Therefore, the use of MMA with 
oblong constellations reduces the number of possible phase 
ambiguities by half. The CMA PT+ using the conventional 
128-cross outperformed the CMA PT+  using 128A-COB 
and 128C-COB because the latter two constellations whose 
kurtosis 1.462sk =  and 1.399sk = , respectively, are 
larger than that of the 128-cross (with 1.34sk = ), sacrifice 
some equalizer convergence rate (i.e., residual ISI removal 
speed) in order to gain some phase tracking speed, 
especially when the ISI of the channel is severe. Simulation 
results similar to those of Fig. 1 were also obtained when 
the same channel with different phase rotations were 
adopted because the carrier phase offset was overshadowed 
by the severity of the ISI of the channel. However, the 
simulation results also show that the SCXA proposed in [23] 
outperformed all the other schemes when the phase 
rotations were less than 30  because the SCXA 
sometimes became trapped in some undesirable local 
minima when the phase rotations were greater than 30 . 
 
IV. MMA USING 16-HEXAGONAL 
CONSTELLATIONS 
This section investigates the performance of 
MMA using 16-hexagonal (16-HEX) constellations. As 
mentioned previously, when the transmitted symbol 
statistics are of QAM non-square constellations, the 
N-points constellations can be arranged into oblong-like 
constellations for fast carrier phase recovery so long as its 
asymmetric nature, 2 2{ ( )} { ( )}
R I
E s n E s n≠  is satisfied. 
Therefore, it may be practically beneficial to the users of 
blind equalization if an optimum constellation having a fast 
carrier phase recovery and low symbol-error rate (SER) 
subject to minimum average transmitted power and 
minimum symbol separation can be developed so long as 
the asymmetric nature, 2 2{ ( )} { ( )}
R I
E s n E s n≠ , is satisfied. 
In order to achieve the objective of fast carrier phase 
recovery and low SER at steady-state subject to minimum 
average transmitted power and minimum symbol separation, 
we investigated the statistical properties of hexagonal 
constellations. For example, the 16-point hexagonal 
constellation investigated in this work is depicted in Fig. 2. 
It turns out that some of these hexagonal constellations are 
naturally asymmetric. This asymmetry nature may allow us 
to develop an optimal bandwidth-efficient two-dimensional 
oblong-like transmission scheme to achieve a fast carrier 
phase recovery and low SER at steady-state while still 
require a minimum average transmitted power. We 
investigated the hexagonal constellations applied to the 
MMA and attempted to find out whether a fast carrier phase 
recovery and low SER at steady-state subject to a minimum 
average transmitted power could be achieved. 
It turned out that the cost function of MMA 
employing the 16-HEX is exactly the same as (3) obtained 
from the oblong constellations. The set of stationary points 
of the MMA for oblong constellations considering 1M =  
can be obtained by setting the gradient of MMAJ  in (3) to 
zero, such that 0

This research also investigated and analyzed the 
MMA employing 16-Hexagonal constellations. While it 
appears to be a novel idea to propose the use of 
16-Hexagonal constellation in the MMA, however, 
computer simulations demonstrated that its performance 
was not as good as that of MMA using the 16-QAM. 
 
VII 計畫成果自評 
This research intends to investigate the 
carrier phase acquisition and tracking of the 
MMA employing both the rectangular 
constellation and 16-Hexagonal constellation. 
The MMA using the former has been analyzed to 
be able to yield fast carrier phase recovery and 
tracking, while the MMA using the latter did not 
yield a performance as good as was expected. A 
paper studying the MMA employing the 
rectangular (or oblong) constellation has been 
submitted to the IEEE Transactions on 
Communications.
