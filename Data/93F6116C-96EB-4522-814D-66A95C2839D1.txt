英文摘要 
 This study is to present the concept and design of recommendation system for the 
green products. The proposed system mainly provides two functions in green product 
information sharing. One of them is to support designers and specialists to clarify the concept 
of a product by building up the green life cycle model. The other role is to serve as a green 
recommender for the consumers. It collects and displays the green levels of the product on the 
internet and recommends consumers the appropriate green products by the product ingredient 
and the consumers’ green preference. Through the recommendation mechanism, the proposed 
green recommender may provide proper information of the green products for both the 
companies and the customers. The proposed concept is described by an illustrative example. 
 
Keywords: Green Products, Green Recommendation, Green Consumption, Green Preference 
Liao (2006) proposed a green information model and a retrieval platform. After the user 
selects the green index, the retrieval system can provide the corresponding green products. 
However, they didn’t consider the weight of the preferred indices. That is the importance for the 
selected indices are viewed as the same.  
In this study, we proposed a model to implement an information management and 
recommendation system for the green products on internet, which bridges the gap between 
designers and customers. The system searches the green products by each selected green indices, 
then retrieve the products by considering the importance of different preferred indices. From the 
manufacturers, they can collect the user’s preference on the related green products. For the 
customers, they can look at the information about greenness of the product and may obtain the 
recommended list to their preference. Section 2 will describes the procedure to establish the 
system. A following illustrative example is described in Section 3 and the results analysis will be 
discussed and concluded in Section 4. 
 
II. System Establishment 
Even though there are many firms who have claimed that their products possess green 
characteristics, the products may only meet part of the environmental protection regulations. For 
different catalog of products, the green indices may have slight difference. For example, 3C 
products will emphasize the qualification in WEEE, RoHS, etc. The farm products will focus on 
the satisfaction of CAS, including high quality agriculture and safe agriculture.  
Before establishing our green recommendation system, we must first collect the information 
of each product’s greenness. For a specific catalog of products, we define N green indices with a 
set of {g , …, g , …, g }, where each is specified by a number of criteria, R . For each product, p1 j N j i, 
i=1,…, M, R  criteria will be judged to be satisfied or not for each green index, gj j, j=1,…,N. Thus, 
we have the satisfactory vector , where  if the green criterion r is 
satisfied with product p

corresponding to each green index is computed as formula (1).

The recommendation mechanism for green information is built according to the vector space 
model (Grossman and Frieder, 1998) of which the weight matrix based on the green indices are 
constructed for all green products as Table 1. Each row vector denotes the degree of the 
greenness for individual product with respect to different index. Therefore, the weight value, wij, 
in the weight matrix will be assigned as the greenness formula (1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III. Illustrated example 
In this study, 70 desktop, 98 monitors and 200 notebooks were collected from EPEAT 
(Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) system. EPEAT was built up by Green 
Electronics Council (2006) to help purchasers in the public and private sectors evaluate, compare 
and select desktop computers, notebooks and monitors based on their environmental attributes. 
They also provide a clear and consistent set of performance criteria for the design of products, 
and provide an opportunity for manufacturers to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce 
the environmental impact of its products. EPEAT summaries the green characteristics 
corresponding to the environmental protection regulations into eight indices, including 23 
required criteria and 28 optional criteria. 
By EPEAT, 8 green indices are used to evaluate the greenness of the products and the 
corresponding numbers of criteria based on different product categories are displayed as Table 2.

g End of life management 3 2 3 6
g   Corporate performance 5 5 5 7

For each product, the weight (greenness) matrix can be obtained by the number of satisfied 
criteria for each index. For example, a product, Apple Mac Pro (Desktop, produced by Apple 
Inc.), is assessed and the numbers of satisfied criteria are 7, 3, 11, 4, 1, 3, 4 and 6 respectively. 
Therefore, the weight (greenness) values are 1, 0.5, 1, 1, 0.25, 1, 0.8, and 0.86 corresponding to 8 
green indices. After all weight values of products are obtained, the weight threshold for each 
green index is computed as . ]38.0,66.0,47.0,09.0,89.0,82.0,09.0,63.0[=w
If a user emphasizes the importance of indices, g , g , and g1 3 4, and the corresponding 
preference rating are 7, 9, 7 respectively. Therefore, the preference rating vector is [7, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 
0, 0]. The retrieved result is obtained based on the weight threshold. Any product will be 
retrieved with the weight value of index 1 greater than 0.63, the weight value of index 3 greater 
than 0.82 and the weight value of index 4 greater than 0.89. Finally, the recommended list will be 
provided by the rank of weighted score with the preference rating vector. Table 3 shows the 
recommended top 10 green products.

their products in terms of environmental characteristics. To 
meet consumers’ expectation and the environmental 
protection regulations, more and more firms’ designers 
urged to obtain various kinds of information from specialists 
of different disciplines. Kurakawa et al. (1997) implemented 
a green browser to support designers and specialists 
collaborative in considering the trade-off relationships 
among requirements for a product over the life cycle. 
However, it is also important to let users know the design 
concept so that the manufacturer can convince the user.  
One of the technical issues in the manufacturing sectors 
is that there has not been an effective way for designers to 
communicate with users. Arora and Gangopadhyay (1995) 
and Motta and Thisse (1999) were the first to produce 
models of firms responding to customer demand and 
competitive pressure when introducing green products. 
Arora and Gangopadhyay empirically observed that there is 
considerable variation within industries in the degree of 
over-compliance with existing standards and concluded that 
in order to avoid competition, individual firms may have an 
interest in differentiating their product with respect to its 
environmental performance. Motta and Thisse focused on 
the impact of a minimum environmental standard on market 
structure and concluded that “greener means richer”. 
Liao (2006) proposed a green information model and a 
retrieval platform. After the user selects the green index, the 
retrieval system can provide the corresponding green 
products. However, they didn’t consider the weight of the 
preferred indices. That is the importance for the selected 
indices are viewed as the same.  
In this study, we proposed a model to implement an 
information management and recommendation system for

green products by each selected green indices, then retrieve 
the products by considering the importance of different 
preferred indices. From the manufacturers, they can collect 
the user’s preference on the related green products. For the 
customers, they can look at the information about greenness 
of the product and may obtain the recommended list to their 
preference. Section 2 will describes the procedure to 
establish the system. A following illustrative example is

IV. Conclusions 
 Our proposed model can provide the users a green 
recommendation platform to search the products with the 
higher level of greenness. In Liao’s study (2006), he only 
considered the selected indices and provided the retrieved 
result by a maximized greenness. We propose a different 
search mechanism and consider the different importance for 
each selected indices. For the users, apart from 
understanding more green information, they also can obtain 
the recommended list for their green preference. For the 
manufacturer, by collecting the preference rating on each 
index, they can further understand the users’ green 
preferences to the products. The product designers can 
collect the users’ preference and understand what the users 
focus on. Furthermore, they not only consider the 
international green regulations, but can design the products 
referred to the users’ preference to reduce the gap between
