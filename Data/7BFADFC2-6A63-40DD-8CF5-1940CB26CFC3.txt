previous researches focusing on UMLS as the domain expansion, we use the concepts in 
UMLS to extract Concept-Verb-Concept patterns (“CVC patterns” for short) from training 
corpus so as to improve the rank of answer texts. We use Naïve bayes model for question 
analysis so as to classify questions into diagnosis, therapy, and etiology and use query 
expansion to increase the recall for document retrieval. A combined ranking is presented for 
ranking answer texts and it is proved to yield promising results on 203 questions in terms of 
0.63 MRR. 
 
 
2 Related Works 
 
2.1 Related works on biomedical NER 
 
Recent textual mining approaches useful to biomedical NER can be divided into rule-based, 
statistical and hybrid methods. Generally, rule-based approaches employ the information of 
terms and hand-craft rules to produce candidates which are then verified by using lexical 
analysis [1] [2] [5]. Yet rule-based methods are essentially lack of portability and scalability. 
On the other hand, statistical models have been widely employed for their portability and 
scalability, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Model (SVM), Maximum 
Entropy (ME), and etc. The recognition accuracy achieved by these models generally depends 
on a well-tagged training corpus and a well set of features [3] [6] [7] [8] [9]. Recently, hybrid 
approaches are proposed by combining coded rules, statistical model and dictionaries [4] [8]. 
As pointed in [9], it can be expected that systems on a specified evaluation corpus with help 
of dictionaries tend to perform better than the general ones without help of any dictionaries. 
For example, the recognition performance is significantly improved when both dictionary and 
rules are applied together with a ME-based recognition mechanism in [4]. 
 
2.2 Related works on anaphora resolution in biomedical literature 
 
In past literature, different strategies for resolving anaphora have been presented by using 
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic clues. For example, grammatical roles of noun phrases 
were used in [14] [15]. In addition to the syntactic information, statistical information like 
co-occurring patterns obtained from a corpus is employed during antecedent finding in [11]. 
However, a large corpus is needed for acquiring sufficient co-occurring patterns and for 
dealing with data sparseness. On the other hand, outer resources, like WordNet, are applied in 
[12] [17] [18] and proved to be helpful to improve the performance of an anaphora resolution 
system like the one presented in [17] where animacy information is exploited by analyzing the 
hierarchical relation of nouns and verbs in the surrounding context learned from WordNet. 
Nevertheless, using WordNet alone for acquiring semantic information is not sufficient for 
solving unknown words. To tackle this problem, a richer resource, the Web, was exploited in 
[19] where anaphoric information is mined from Google search results at the expense of less 
precision. 
The domain-specific ontologies like UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) has 
been employed in [10] in such a way that frequent semantic types associated to agent (subject) 
and patient (object) role of subject-action or action-object patterns can be extracted. The result 
showed such kind of patterns could gain increase in both precision (76% to 80%) and recall 
(67% to 71%). On the other hand, Kim and Park [16] built their BioAR to relate protein 
names to SWISS-Prot entries by using the centering theory presented by [13] and salience 
measures by [10].

definition database from UMLS to answer the definitional question. If the definition is not 
found in it, the online dictionary is queried to answer the question and expand the definition 
database at the same time. 
 
3 The Proposed Methods and Results 
 
3.1 The proposed named entities recognition 
 
In this project, the recognition for protein entities from PubMed corpus is addressed so as to 
facilitate the automation of protein interaction databases construction. In order to mine more 
features relevant to protein entities, we assembled a domain-specific protein corpus SRC 
(SwissProt_Ref Corpus) extracted from SwissProt reference articles and tagged it by using 
SRC entry collection. The kernel NER is approached with two empirical strategies. One is 
rule-based strategy which exploits the patterns information mined from SRC. Experimental 
results show that the derived patterns are useful for NER task even though the number of the 
patterns is relatively less than the rules used in two popular systems Kex or Yapex. On the 
other hand, a concise HMM-based strategy is presented with a back-off strategy to overcome 
data sparseness. Experimental results on both GENIA corpus and the domain-specific SRC 
showed that the presented approach could achieve promising results in terms of 77% F-score 
in the case of strict annotation, proving that our approach is portable and competitive. 
Besides, the recognition of the entities in coordination variants is concerned in this 
project. To resolve such term variants, a method based on heuristic rules together with 
clustering strategies is presented. Experimental results on GENIA corpus 3.0 proved the 
feasibility of the proposed approach by achieving 88.51% recall and 57.04% precision. 
For detail description about the proposed method, please refer the attached conference 
paper presented in NLDB 2005, Alicante, Spain.  
 
3.2 The proposed anaphora resolution for biomedical literature 
 
In this project, a resolution procedure as shown in Figure 3.1 is presented for tackling both 
nominal anaphora and pronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using morphological, 
syntactic and semantic clues. For nominal anaphora resolution, semantic association between 
anaphora and its antecedents is predicted with the semantic lexicons mined from UMLS and 
WordNet. For unknown entities, the semantic association is discovered by mining the search 
results with the help of PubMed, the search engine for MEDLINE databases. On the other 
hand, semantic coercion type of pronominal anaphor is done by semantic-tagged SA/AO 
patterns, which were pre-collected from GENIA 3.02p corpus. Unlike manual decision of 
feature sets at salience grading on antecedent selection, the presented resolution is boosted 
with a genetic algorithm. Experimental results on the evaluation corpus MedStract, the 
presented resolution is promising for its 92% F-Score in pronominal anaphora and 78% 
F-Score in nominal anaphora. 
For detail description about the proposed method, please refer the attached conference 
paper presented in IJCNLP 2005, Jesu Island, South Korea. 
 
3.3 The proposed relation recognition from biomedical literature 
 
In this project, the interactions between protein pairs are addressed. The SWISS-PROT 
database is used as our lexicon to identify protein entities in corpus by maximum matching 
procedure. Through corpus preprocessing, protein pairs are formed and processed by the 
proposed extraction method. As shown in Figure 3.2, the proposed relation extraction is 
 6
(i). The length of POS sequence is less and equal than four. 
(ii). [“What or Who” + “be” + NP], the question structure is identified as structure 1 or 
structure 2. 
(iii). The question contains only one NP. 
(iv). There are no prepositions in NP. 
In the experiment, we take 40 definitional questions from TREC-9 to evaluate the 
definitional rules. The experimental results show that 36 questions are detected by these rules. 
The accuracy rate is 90% in the test data. Some errors are resulted from wrong parsing tree or 
tags.  
 
3.4.2   Naïve-Bayes classifier for classifying other type questions 
 
A Naïve-Bayes classifier is used to classify the non-definitional questions into the pre-defined 
types, namely: diagnosis, therapy and etiology. We collect 8,729 medical documents classified 
by PubMed as the training data. Then we filter out stop words or medical proper nouns in 
UMLS. The remaining monograms (single word) and bigrams (adjacent two words) are 
clustered into 18 groups by a typical K-means algorithm. Meanwhile, we extract POS 
sequence from the classified questions and use POS sequence as one feature for our classifier. 
We follow the Bayesian Theorem (defined by Equation (1)) to train the question classifier by 
the features of grams and POS sequence. Each question is assigned with one unique question 
type. In the testing phase, we take 453 questions randomly from the rest FAQs. There are 85% 
precision and 86% recall for diagnosis, 84% precision and 94% recall for therapy and 82% 
precision and 88% recall for etiology.  
3.4.3   Concept identification 
Concept identification is presented with the help of UMLS for each medical phrase in the 
question so as to transform the NP-Verb-NP pattern into CVC pattern. Since UMLS is the 
multi-node structure, it is necessary for us to do concept disambiguation. We use the 
co-occurrence information in UMLS and the concept probabilistic function is designed as 
equation (3). Then we use the association function defined as (2) to measure which concepts 
are the most possible one to be associated in the sentence. Details of concept identification 
steps are summarized as following.

freq(Verb,CB) = the co-occurrence for (Verb,CB) 
freq(CA,Verb) = the co-occurrence for (CA,Verb) 
freq(CA,Verb,CB) = the co-occurrence for (CA,Verb,CB) 
The extracted CVC patterns are used to score the answer texts in information retrieval. In the 
training phase, we use 400 medical terms as the keywords in UMLS to query the PubMed and 
collect 8,729 medical abstracts for training materials. The strategy is that all noun phrase 
preceding and succeeding the key verbs are extracted in the medical abstracts. If the noun 
phrase is a pronoun, the noun phrase which is preceded or succeeded the pronoun is extracted 
instead of the pronoun. Then noun phrases are combined with their preceding and succeeding 
verb as NP-Verb-NP patterns which are then transformed into CVC patterns. 
For the verb in CVC patterns, we use the synsets of verb in WordNet to cluster CVC 
patterns into 4,496 groups and then we weigh each CVC pattern by equation (4). 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At run time, we use CVC pattern extracted from the given question to retrieve the stored 
CVC patterns from the training result and use the relevant CVC patterns to score the answer 
texts returned by search engine. 
 
3.4.4   Ontology-based Query Expansion 
 
The query expansion is done with the the synonyms and hierarchical relations in UMLS 
Metathesaurus. The expanded strategy is described as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.4.5   Retrieval procedure and ranking 
In the proposed QA, we use PubMed as the major information retrieval platform and Google 
as the minor platform. PubMed is triggered to retrieve the relevant medical texts if there exists. 
If not, Google will be triggered to retrieve the snippets according to the keywords from the 
given question. 
The answer texts are measured by equation (5) based on TF-IDF. 
 
 
 
 
 
For each medical term in query 
(i). Add the synonym variants in UMLS to the query 
(ii). Add its parent terms in UMLS to the query 
(iii). Add its child terms in UMLS to the query 
(iv). Add other relations defined in UMLS to the query

prove that the semantic features provided with the help of the outer resources indeed can 
enhance anaphora resolution. Compared to other approaches, the presented best-first strategy 
with the genetic-algorithm based feature selection can achieve the best resolution on the same 
evaluation corpus. Partial results of this research have been presented in IJCNLP 2005, Jesu 
Island, Korea. (Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple 
Resources, IJCNLP 2005, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 3651, pp. 742-753, 2005. 
(SCI extended)). 
The third issue is automation of relation recognition among entities. In this project, we 
focus the protein interaction recognition from biomedical literature by employing both 
database and textual mining techniques. Unlike previous researches which are generally based 
on linguistic methods, a two-stage recognition approach is proposed in this project with the 
aim to improve the recognition recall. The first stage involves utilizing linguistic patterns 
which imply interaction relation from sentence structures. The second stage is based on a 
Naïve Bayes classifier which employs a rich set of features, including surface features, 
co-occurrence, co-citations, and protein features. We use two corpora as our testing data. One 
is a corpus of 155 MEDLINE abstracts, and the other contains 100 abstracts which are 
collected from the references for proving interactions in DIP (Database of Interaction 
Proteins). The result shows that our approach can yield 62% and 61% F-score on both corpora 
and it indeed enhance the low recall yielded by a general linguistic recognition approach.  
The fourth issue we addressed in this two-year project is the implementation of a 
specific-domain QA prototype which is able to efficiently resolve the questions frequently 
raised by end-users. We apply UMLS, a domain–specific ontology to query expansion. Beside, 
we present a new answer passage ranking by weighing the transformed concept patterns 
mined at the training phase. The patterns provide a more general outlook for medical QA with 
respect to different kinds of question types. The presented QA is verified with different kinds 
of questions by various measurements. The results show that the proposed QA is able to 
retrieve the answer passage in the top 2 (or top 3) returned texts. Partial results of this 
research have been presented in IJCNLP 2005, Jesu Island, Korea. (“Web-based Unsupervised 
Learning for Query Formulation in Question Answering”, IJCNLP 2005, Lecture Notes in 
Artificial Intelligence 3651, pp. 519-529, 2005. (SCI extended)).
