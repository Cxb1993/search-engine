ring-opening reaction of epoxy resin (DGEBA) could be initiated by acidic 
electrophilic protonation22 (2–5) or attacked with the nucleophilic part23 of the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Measurement of the pH value of catalysts 2–7 in water and the curing 
mechanism study: 
Since the polymerization of DGEBA were reported to be initiated by the protonation 
of the oxirane followed by ring opening by the nucleophiles from the catalysts (see 
Scheme 2),24–28 the pH value of the catalyst would contribute to the efficiency of the 
polymerization. In aqueous solution, the amphiphatic pyrazine and pyridine 
compounds 2–5 were presented as moderate to strong acid and the pH values ranged 
from 1.11 to 3.37 (see Table 1). As a result, we proposed an initiate mechanism of 
polymerization would be initiated by the protonation of the acid species in these cases 
2–5.22,29 Then, the propagation and polymerization of epoxy were performed by the 
 - 4 - 
= 7.01). Many of mechanisms were proposed for the nucleophilic catalysts (e.g. 
imidazole derivatives).24–28 The initiation step of amhiphatic piperazine catalysts 6 
and 7 was considered to directly attack the oxirane of DGEBA by the nucleophilic 
moiety of the catalysts at elevated temperatures.

Measurement of Pot-life: 31  
Sample Preparation: The catalyst level was set to 2% w/w to DGEBA. The viscosity 
and epoxide equivalent weight of DGEBA was 2100–2500 cp and 188–199 g/equiv, 
respectively. The samples were mixed by use of a high shear blender and degassed in 
vacuum oven. All samples were stored in glass vials at room temperature between 
viscosity measurements. The glass vials were rotated by a rotator at ~10 rpm all the 
time to keep the filler from settling.  
Measurement of Viscosity: The viscosities of the samples were measured periodically

The cure activation energy (Ea): 
The cure behaviors of DGEBA resin with catalysts 2–7 (2% w/w) were studied with 
TG/DTA in the dynamic scanning mode at different heating rates. The cure activation 
energy (Ea) of the overall process was determined by the Kissinger method:33,34

Where, ϕ is the heating rate; Tm is the temperature of the maximum exothermic peak; 
A is the pre-exponential factor; and R is the gas constant (8.314 J/g.mole.K).  
Ea can be obtained from the slope from the graph of ln (ϕ/Tm2) versus (1/Tm) on 
the basis of the Equation (1). The parameter and experiment for curing DGEBA by 
catalyst 2–7 from TG/DTA were obtained and plotted in accordance with equation (1) 
as shown in Figure 2. The activation energy Ea for each process were calculated and 
listed in Table 2.

ln (ϕ/Tm2) –9.10 –9.41 –9.87 –10.60 –8.92 74.16 
From Table 2, we found the Ea values for DGEBA with catalyst 1–7 were in the 
range of 66.76–84.89 kJ/mol. The Ea values, which reflected the relative controlled 
polymerization, were in the order of 6 (84.89 kJ/mol) > 4 (76.90 kJ/mol) > 7 (74.16 
kJ/mol) > 1 (69.26 kJ/mol) > 2 (68.84 kJ/mol) > 5 (67.17 kJ/mol) > 3 (66.76 kJ/mol). 
Their tendency is consistent with the viscosity measurements.  
Differential Thermometry Analysis (TG/DTA):35  
Results from TG/DTA analysis for the curing of DGEBA by use of catalysts 2–7 at 
four concentrations were summarized in Table 3, in which showed the exotherm onset, 
exotherm peak, and total heat for the polymerization. We found that the curing of 
DGEBA by the catalyst 2–7 showed one main exotherm peak varying with different 
catalyst concentration in TG/DTA and the peaks shifted towards lower temperatures 
when catalysts 2–7 increased. That might due the enhancement of the reaction rate by 
more catalysts (see Figure 3–8).28 Total heat output revealed that all the 
polymerizations were exothermic, and that for the curing by amphiphatic piperazine, 
pyrazine, and pyridine compounds (2–7, 5–20 wt %) were 42–470 J/g. According to 
3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylic acid 4 was an amino-acid zwitterion compound, the 
nucleophilicity was de-active to provide the lower reactivity and total heats (43–94 J/g, 
5–20 wt %, see Table 3). For strong acidic amphiphatic pyrazine catalysts 2–3 or 
basic amphiphatic piperazine catalyst 6–7, they possessed the strong protonation 
reactivity or the alternate strong nucleophiles containing the nitrogen or oxygen anion 
moieties, the higher exothermic heats were generated (42–470 J/g, 5–20 wt %). The 
total heat output is important to evaluate the feasibility for the curing system, for too

The conversions of the DGEBA by catalyst 2–7 (calculated from TGA, see Table 4) 
were plotted against the curing temperature as shown in Figure 10. Except for the

epoxy resins to provide the good latent properties. Based on the studies of the 
viscosity and Ea measurement, the activity order of the thermally latent catalytic 
systems was estimated to be piperazine-2-carboxylic acid (6) >  
3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (4) > 3-piperazin-1-yl-propionic acid (7) > 
2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid (2) > picolinic acid (5) > 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (3).  
From the conversions results, catalysts 2–5 rapidly rose at specific and narrow 
temperature ranges to initiate the polymerization in the molding temperature 
(100–175 oC). Concerning the glass transition temperature (Tg), the use of 
amphiphatic pyrazine, pyridine, and piperazine catalysts 2–5 indicate that complete or 
near complete curing systems were obtained in the range of about 52–82 °C, In the 
model system, the Tg values of the polymers formed by use of amphiphatic catalysts 
2–7 were about 52–82 °C, 3-aminopyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (4) was similar to 
N-benzylpyrazinium hexafluoroantimonate (85 °C, 1, BHP). Due to most of the 
cationic latent catalysts (e.g. BHP, 1) would be released the acidic by-product 
including HBF4, HPF6, HAsF6 and HSbF6 to damage the electronic products, the 
new-developed amphiphatic catalysts might provide an alternative pathway in the 
manufacturing of DGEBA. Moreover, compound 2–7 are quite or mild stable at room 
temperature. The prolongation the pot-life of DGEBA resin could thus be achieved by 
use of these amphiphatic catalysts to enhance the storage stability and good handling 
of biphenyl type epoxy polymers.
