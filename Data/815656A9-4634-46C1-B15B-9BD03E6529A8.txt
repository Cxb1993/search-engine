which is constructed (see Pearn et al. (1992)) by combining the yield-based index Cpk and the loss-based index Cpm, taking 
into account the process yield (meeting the manufacturing specifications) as well as the process loss (variation from the 
target). The index Cpmk responds to the departure of the process mean µ from the target value T faster than the other three basic 
indices Cp, Cpk, and Cpm, while it remains sensitive to the changes of process variation. It is noted that a process meeting the 
capability requirement ‘Cpk ≥ C’ may not be meeting the capability requirement ‘Cpm ≥ C’. On the other hand, a process 
meeting the capability requirement ‘Cpm ≥ C’ may not be meeting the capability requirement ‘Cpk ≥ C’ either. The discrepancy 
between the two indices may be contributed to the fact that the Cpk index primarily measures the process yield, but the index 
Cpm focuses mainly on the process loss. But, if the process meets the capability requirement ‘Cpmk ≥ C’, then the process must 
meet both capability requirements ‘Cpk ≥ C’ and ‘Cpm ≥ C’ since Cpmk ≤ Cpk and Cpmk ≤ Cpm. According to today’s modern 
quality improvement theory, reduction of the process loss is as important as increasing the process yield. While the Cpk 
remains the more popular and widely used index, the index Cpmk is considered to be the most useful index to date for processes 
with two-sided specification limits. 
The index Cp, a function of the process standard deviation σ and the specification limits, has been referred to as the 
precision index which is defined to measure the consistency of the process quality characteristic relative to the manufacturing 
tolerance. The index Ca, a function of the process mean and the specification limits, has been referred to as the accuracy index, 
which is defined to measure the degree of process centering relative to the manufacturing tolerance. Noting that 0 ≤ Ca ≤ 1 for 
LSL ≤ µ ≤ USL, and Ca < 0 for µ < LSL or µ > USL. Especially, Ca = 1 for µ = m. The three indices Cpk, Cpm and Cpmk may be 
ewritten respectively as following:  r
 
Cpk = CpCa, Cpm = p
2
p a1+[3 (1 )]
C
C C−
, and Cpmk = p a
2
p a1+[3 (1 )]
C C
C C−
,             (3) 
 
which all are functions of the two basic indices Cp and Ca.  
In recent quality research and capability analysis, it has been often noted that the Cpmk index provides both a lower bound 
on the process yield, that is, Yield = Φ[(USL – µ)/σ] – Φ[(LSL – µ)/σ] ≥ 2Φ(3Cpmk) – 1, and an upper bound on the fraction 
of the nonconformities, P(NC) = 1 – Φ[(USL – µ)/σ] + Φ[(LSL – µ)/σ] ≤ 2Φ(-3Cpmk). In this paper, the behavior of the 
actual process yield is investigated in terms of the number of nonconformities (in ppm) for processes with fixed index value of 
Cpk = Cpm = Cpmk, but with different degrees of process centering, which can be expressed as a function of the capability index 
Ca. The results illustrate the advantage of using the index Cpmk over both the indices Cpk and Cpm when measuring process 
capability, since Cpmk provides better customer protection.  
 
 
2. PROCESS YIELD MEASURING BASED ON Cpmk
 
If the process characteristic, X, follows the normal distribution, N(µ, σ2), then the fraction of the nonconformities (NC) may 
be expressed as:  
 
P(NC) =  Pr(X < LSL) + Pr(X > USL) = LSL − µ⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟σ⎝ ⎠Φ  + 
USL − µ⎛ −⎜ σ⎝ ⎠Φ
⎞⎟ ,              (4) 
 
where Φ( . ) is the cumulated distribution function of N(0, 1). Since USL = m + d and LSL = m – d, then 
 
P(NC) = m d− − µ⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟σ⎝ ⎠Φ  + 
m d+ − µ⎛ ⎞−⎜ ⎟σ⎝ ⎠Φ   = 
1 | |⎡ ⎤+ δ−⎢ ⎥γ⎣ ⎦
Φ  + 1 | |⎡ ⎤− δ−⎢ ⎥γ⎣ ⎦Φ ,            (5) 
 
where δ = (µ – m)/d and  γ = σ/d. On the other hand, since |δ| = 1 – Ca and γ = 1/(3Cp), then P(NC) may be rewritten as:  
 
P(NC) = [ ] [ ]p a3 (2 ) 3C C C C− − + −Φ Φ p a ,                                  (6) 
 
which is a function of the two basic indices Cp and Ca. 
The yield as a function of Cpmk is determined as follows. Since 
 
Cpmk = p a

then, 3Cpmk/(1 + 3Cpmk) ≤ Ca ≤ 1 and Cp = Cpmk/{Ca 2 – [3Cpmk (1 – Ca)]2}1/2. Consequently, we have the following 
relationship between the process yield and the index Cpmk for 3Cpmk/(1 + 3Cpmk) ≤ Ca ≤ 1:

Table 1 displays the number of nonconformities (in ppm) for Cpmk = 0.9(0.1)1.5 with various values of Ca satisfying the 
bound 3Cpmk/(1 + 3Cpmk) ≤ Ca ≤ 1. Lin and Pearn (2006) obtained a lower bound for the yield as: Yield ≥ 2Φ(3Cpmk) – 1, or 
P(NC) ≤ 2Φ(-3Cpmk) for Cpmk > 2 /3  Table 2 displays the nonconformity bounds in ppm for C0.4715.≈ pmk = 
0.91(0.01)2.00. For example, for Cpmk = 1.24, the number of nonconformities is no greater than 200 ppm.  
 
 
3. COMPARISONS WITHIN Cpmk, Cpm AND Cpk
 
Boyles (1991) noted a bound for the yield as: pk2 [3 ] 1C −Φ  ≤ Yield ≤ pk[3 ]CΦ , or pk[ 3 ]C−Φ  ≤ P(NC) ≤ pk2 [ 3 ]C−Φ  for

Ruczinski (1996) obtained a lower bound for the yield as: Yield ≥ 2Φ(3Cpm) – 1, or P(NC) ≤ 2Φ(-3Cpm) for Cpm > 3 /3 
 Pearn and Lin (2004) also obtained a yield measure formula based on C0.5776.≈ pm for Ca ≥ (3Cpm – 1)/( 3Cpm) as: 
 
P(NC) = pm a

Hence, P(NC) ≤ 2Φ(-3C) and 0 ≤ Ca ≤ 1, i.e., LSL ≤ µ ≤ USL, for Cpk = C.  P(NC) ≤ 2Φ(-3C) and (3 C – 1)/(3 C) ≤ Ca ≤ 
1, i.e., m – d/(3C) ≤ µ ≤ m + d/(3C), for Cpm = C. And, P(NC) ≤ 2Φ(-3C) and 3C/(1 + 3C) ≤ Ca ≤ 1, i.e., m – d/(1 + 3C) ≤ µ 
≤ m + d/(1 + 3C), for Cpmk = C. For example, if Cpk = 1.0 we only have the information of process yield through the upper 
bound P(NC) ≤ 2699.80 ppm. But, if Cpm = 1.0 we have the information of process yield through the upper bound P(NC) ≤ 
2699.80 ppm and process centering measure 0.667 ≤ Ca ≤ 1. And, if Cpmk = 1.0 we also have the information of process yield 
through the upper bound P(NC) ≤ 2699.80 ppm and process centering measure 0.75 ≤ Ca ≤ 1.

For processes with target value setting on the middle of the specification limits (T = m), the index Cpmk may be rewritten as: 
Cpmk = (b – |ξ|)/[3(1 + ξ2)1/2]. Given that Cpmk = C, b = d/σ can be expressed as b = |ξ| + 3C(1 + ξ2)1/2. Given a value of C 
(the capability requirement), Pr( pmkCˆ ≥ w|Cpmk = C), the p-value corresponding to w, a specific value of pmkCˆ  calculated from 
the sample data, is:

Noting that the smaller is the p-value, the stronger is the evidence that suggests rejection of the null hypothesis H0. Pearn and 
Lin (2002) then implemented the theory of testing hypothesis and provided efficient Maple program to calculate Equation 
(13), to obtain the p-value for given w value.  
Generally ξ = (µ – m)/σ is unknown. It is noted that in calculating Equation (13) ξ was replaced by = (ξˆ X  – m)/ . 
This approach is similar to the one proposed by Cheng (1994) for testing the process capability index C
nS
pm. Such an approach 
certainly would make our approach less reliable. Pearn and Lin (2002) examined the behaviors of the critical values c0 as a 
function of ξ, then concluded that the p-value for ξ = 0.50 is greater than the p-values for other choice of ξ in all case. Based 
on the conservative p-value, the decision making is more reliable. Hence, setting ξ = 0.50 in Equation (13) without estimating 
another unknown parameter, the p-value corresponding to w, a specific value of pmkCˆ  calculated from the sample data, is: 
 
p-value =

An efficient Maple program as that in Figure 2 is developed to calculate Equation (14), to obtain the p-value for given w, 
a specific value of pmkCˆ  calculated from the sample data.  The program is listed below, with input parameters set to: C = 1.33, 
n = 100, and w = 1.53. The program gives the p-value corresponding to C = 1.33, n = 100, and w = 1.53 as 0.0566. Based on 
the p-value, the decision is made to reject the null hypothesis Ho: Cpmk ≤ C, or to not reject the null hypothesis. Then, the 
practitioners can determine whether their process meets the preset capability requirement, and make reliable decisions.

6. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Process capability indices, Cp, Ca, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk have been proposed to the manufacturing industry as capability 
measures based on various criteria including variation, departure, yield, and loss. All of the Cpk, Cpm and Cpmk indices provide 
the same lower bounds on process yield, that is, Yield ≥ 2Φ(3Cpk) – 1 = 2Φ(3Cpm) – 1 = 2Φ(3Cpmk) – 1. In this paper, the 
behavior of the actual process yield was investigated in terms of the number of nonconformities for processes with fixed 
indices values of Cpk = C, Cpm = C, and Cpmk = C, but with different degrees of process centering, which can be expressed as a 
function of the capability index Ca. The three indices Cpk, Cpm, and  Cpmk  were compared in terms of the process yield and the 
process loss. The results illustrate the advantage of using the index Cpmk over the index Cpk and Cpm in measuring process 
capability, as Cpmk provides better protection to the customers. An efficient Maple program is also given to calculate the 
p-value for pmkCˆ  value calculated from the sample data. Based on the p-value, the practitioners can determine whether their 
process meets the preset capability requirement, and make reliable decisions.

二、與會心得 
 
The conference was a forum for researchers and practitioners from 21 countries that include 
China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Mongolia, Oman, 
Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, USA, Venezuela, and Yemen to share their 
research findings and practical experiences on variety of the areas in industrial engineering.  The 
conference papers were presented in 59 sessions including 5 organized sessions in a three-day 
period.  The selected articles cover theory, applications and practice of a variety of the areas in 
industrial engineering.  Today, as the economics environment surrounding industrial systems 
becomes to be global and complex, traditional approach to industrial engineering no longer suffices.  
The new theory and its applications in practice need to be explored, developed, and implemented.  
The conference offered the memorable opportunity to all the participants to achieve those goals. 
 
 
process must meet both capability requirements “Cpk C” and “Cpm C” since Cpmk Cpk and Cpmk Cpm. According to
today’s modern quality improvement theory, reduction of the process loss is as important as increasing the process yield. 
While the Cpk remains the more popular and widely used index, the index Cpmk is considered to be the most useful index to

The index Cp, a function of the process standard deviation and the specification limits, has been referred to as the

which is defined to measure the degree of process centering relative to the manufacturing tolerance. Noting that 0Ca1 for
LSLUSL, and Ca < 0 for< LSL or> USL. Especially, Ca = 1 for= m. The three indices Cpk, Cpm and Cpmk may be
rewritten respectively as following:

which all are functions of the two basic indices Cp and Ca.
In recent quality research and capability analysis, it has been often noted that the Cpmk index provides both a lower bound
on the process yield, that is, Yield =[(USL–)/]–[(LSL–)/]2(3Cpmk)–1, and an upper bound on the fraction
of the nonconformities, P(NC) = 1 –[(USL –)/] + [(LSL –)/] 2(-3Cpmk). In this paper, the behavior of the
actual process yield is investigated in terms of the number of nonconformities (in ppm) for processes with fixed index value of
Cpk = Cpm = Cpmk, but with different degrees of process centering, which can be expressed as a function of the capability index
Ca. The results illustrate the advantage of using the index Cpmk over both the indices Cpk and Cpm when measuring process
capability, since Cpmk provides better customer protection.
2. PROCESS YIELD MEASURING BASED ON Cpmk

where( . ) is the cumulated distribution function of N(0, 1). Since USL = m + d and LSL = m–d, then

where= (–m)/d and = /d. On the other hand, since || = 1–Ca and= 1/(3Cp), then P(NC) may be rewritten as:
P(NC) =    p a p a3 (2 ) 3C C C C     , (6)
which is a function of the two basic indices Cp and Ca.
The yield as a function of Cpmk is determined as follows. Since

then, 3Cpmk/(1 + 3Cpmk) Ca 1 and Cp = Cpmk/{Ca2 –[3Cpmk (1 –Ca)]2}1/2. Consequently, we have the following

Hence, P(NC)2(-3C) and 0Ca1, i.e., LSLUSL, for Cpk = C. P(NC)2(-3C) and (3C - 1)/(3C)Ca

m + d/(1 + 3C), for Cpmk = C. For example, if Cpk = 1.0 we only have the information of process yield through the upper
bound P(NC)2699.80 ppm. But, if Cpm = 1.0 we have the information of process yield through the upper bound P(NC)
2699.80 ppm and process centering measure 0.667Ca1. And, if Cpmk = 1.0 we also have the information of process yield
through the upper bound P(NC)2699.80 ppm and process centering measure 0.75Ca1.
According totoday’s modern quality improvement theories based on Taguchi’s quality philosophy, reduction of variation 
from the target value is the guiding principle. Therefore, attention should focus on meeting the target instead of meeting the
tolerances. Following the principle, ifis far away from the target T such that the corresponding Ca is small, then the process
should not be considered capable even if is so small that the P(NC) is also small. Table 3 displays the bounds of P(NC) and Ca
for Cpk = Cpm = Cpmk = C, respectively. Figures 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c) display the plots of the actual number of the nonconformities
(in ppm) for Cpm = Cpk = Cpmk = 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5, with the restrictions 0 Ca1 for Cpk, (3Cpm–1)/(3Cpm)Ca1 for Cpm,
and (3Cpmk)/(1 + 3Cpmk)Ca1 for Cpmk. The results illustrate the advantage of using the index Cpmk over the indices Cpk and
Cpm when measuring process capability, as Cpmk provides better customer protection in terms of product quality loss.
4. ESTIMATING AND TE STING Cpmk
In generally, both the process mean and the process variance 2 are unknown. The estimated index pmkCˆ is obtained by
replacing and 2 by their estimators. Since 1 /n iiX X n and 2 21( ) /nn iiS X X n  are the MLEs of and 2,
respectively, then the estimated index pmkCˆ defined as:
pmkCˆ =
