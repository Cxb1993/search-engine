Abstract 
 
We used the chemical bath deposition method to 
grow well-aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire arrays 
onto conductive wire mesh substrates. To obtain a 
better understanding of how their structure govern 
their behavior, the influences of the fabrication 
factors on the properties of the prepared materials, 
such as geometries, crystallinity, and shapes, will be 
systematically investigated. The functionalization of 
the semiconductor layers on the above prepared 
materials was carried out by the successive ionic 
layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The 
prepared functionalized nanostructures served as 
photoanode in the applications of 
photoelectrocatalytic water splitting to transform 
H2O into H2 and O2 with improved stability and 
efficiency. In this study, a total light to hydrogen 
conversion efficiency of >3% was achieved under 
one simulated AM 1.5 solar light illumination (100 
mW/cm2).

二、緣由與目的 
 
One-dimensional (1-D) metal oxide 
nanostructured arrays have represented a new 
generation of photoelectrode materials for 
photovoltaic (PV) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) 
applications to supply clean and recyclable energy 
[1–4]. However, the materials being developed for 
photoanode have been limited by their poor 
utilization of solar energy. Efforts to shift their band 
gap via substitutional element doping [5–7] and 
coupling of narrow band-gap semiconductor 
photosensitizers [3,4,8–10] have successfully 
extended their photoresponse to visible light. For 
example, the combination of CdS and TiO2 nanotube 
arrays on opaque Ti substrate, featuring highly 
decreased intercrystalline contacts and vectorial 
charge transport along the axis, has exhibited 
impressive photoconversion efficiencies in PEC 
studies [11–13]. However, the uniform deposition of 
narrow band-gap semiconductors to prevent 
entrance clogging and the high accessibility of outer 
sunlight to minimize incident-light-angle 
dependence have been technically challenging. 
The wire-shaped electrodes offer new 
opportunities for design and fabrication PV and PEC 
devices. Several wire-shaped PVs based on TiO2 
nanoparticles [14] and nanotubes [15] have recently 
been reported. Zou’s group proposed wire-shaped 
flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by 
depositing TiO2 nanoparticles concentrically around 
stainless steel mesh [14]. Their non-planar structure 
DSSCs were almost capable of harvesting the light 
from any illumination direction and exhibited a 
conversion efficiency of 1.49%.  Misra and 
co-workers [15] fabricated the TiO2 nanotube arrays 
over the Ti mesh using electrochemical method. 
Using the wire-shaped TiO2 nanotube-array 
electrode in the DSSCs, the efficiency is up to 
2.78%. However, the substrate is limited to Ti 
metallic wire thus far reported. In this work, we 
demonstrate that a wire-shaped electrode for 
photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation with a 
solar-conversion-hydrogen efficiency of 2.8% and 
 4
long-wavelength side of the peak maximum are 
attributed to the enhanced light harvesting within the 
electrode. That may be due to that non-planar 
structure provides the scattering center for incident 
light and thus elongates the path-length of the 
long-wavelength incident light to promote the 
capture of photons by CdSe nanoparticles.  
The photocurrent densities generated from the 
wire-shaped and flat-shaped CdSe/ZnO 
nanowire-array electrodes under light on/off 
illumination are presented in Fig. 4(a). Obviously, 
the photocurrent generated with the wire-shaped 
electrode is much higher than that of the flat-shaped 
electrode. The photoconversion efficiency (η) of 
light energy to chemical energy in the presence of an 
external applied potential is calculated according to 
η (%) = jp[(Eorev-Eapp)/Io] × 100. Eorev = 1.23 V is the 
potential corresponding to the Gibbs free energy 
change per photon in the water splitting reaction. 
Eapp =Emeas-Eocp, the term Emeas is the electrode 
potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode. jp 
is the photocurrent density and Io is the intensity of 
the incident light. The results are depicted in Fig. 
4(b). A maximum conversion efficiency of 2.7 % is 
obtained with the wire-shaped electrode, much 
higher than 2.2 % for the flat-shaped electrode. As a 
result of strong absorption within solar spectrum and 
improved mass transport of electrolyte in the 
wire-shaped electrode, a >20% improvement in 
solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency was 
obtained.  
Thanks to CdSe/ZnO nanowire arrays formed in 
all directions over Cu wires, thus leading to low 
incident-light-angle dependence. To confirm this 
character by experiments, we measured the current 
density at a potential of -0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl between 
normal incidence and ±60o for both the wire-shaped 
and flat-shaped electrodes. As shown in Fig. 5, the 
wire-shaped electrode-based cell’s performance had 
lower dependence on the light’s incident angle as 
compared to the planar electrode-base cell. For 
example, under 60o illumination, 80% of the 
photogenerated current with normal illumination 
was obtained in the wire-shaped electrode-based cell, 
but only 50% for the planar electrode-based cell. 
The results confirm that the wire-shaped electrodes 
can almost harvest all the light from any direction in 
the surroundings, which is helpful for increasing the 
daily average photoelectrochemical conversion 
efficiency. A maximum conversion efficiency of 
3.3% is obtained with CdS-CdSe-cosensitized ZnO 
nanowire electrode, much higher than 2.6% and 
2.7% for the CdS-sensitized and CdSe-sensitized 
electrodes. 
We report the fabrication of wire-shaped 
electrode with radially outward orientated 
CdSe/ZnO nanowires. The structures overcome 
insufficient electrolyte mass transport, poor light 
harvesting, and strong dependence to incident light 
angle observed among planar electrodes, leading to a 
N30% increase in photocurrent density. Although 
many factors related to photoelectrochemical 
performance
