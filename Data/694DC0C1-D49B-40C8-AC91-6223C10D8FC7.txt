In DS-CDMA with PSK modulation, the received signals can be 
despreaded to reject MAI (multiple access interference) before 
data demodulation. Unfortunately, similar despreading and 
demodulation process cannot be directly applied to DS-SSMA 
using CPM, except for minimum shift keying (MSK) [5], which 
is a linear modulation. Recently, a new class of DS-SSMA with 
CPM, called dual-phase DS-SSMA (DP-DS-SSMA) [3], is 
devised to not only overcome this problem but also achieve 
better performance. In [2] Laurent showed that CPM signals can 
be decomposed into a sum of 2L-1 PAM signals, L is the memory 
size. By considering the major part of the PAM signals, the 
GMSK can be approximated as a linear modulation [6]. More 
important we can apply despreading in front of demodulating 
just as receiver for DS-CDMA/PSK. In the sequel shows this 
scheme is very attractive as compared to dual phase DS-SSMA, 
as GMSK is considered.  
In section 2 the linear decomposition of precoded-GMSK signal 
is introduced. In section 3 the GMSK signal combined with DS-
SSMA is considered. And we construct a linear receiver to 
despread/demodulate the received signals. In section 4 numerical 
results are given to show the BER performance is no worse than 
DP-DS-SSMA and in some cases even better. Finally, 
conclusions are given in section 5.

where ln 2 / 2 bBTσ π= , and parameter L is the duration of

size, L =3. In [2], it showed that for any binary CPM signal with 
a modulation memory size L could be expressed as a linear 
combination of 12 −L  PAM signals, i.e. 4 PAM in our case. 
Furthermore, only two pulses are significant while the others are 
closed to zero [6]. Besides, the main pulse, 0 ( )C t , contains 
99.63% of the total GMSK pulse energy, defined as

The low frequency components convolute with the filter C0(t), 
multiply by (-1)n, and despread with spreading code after the 
parallel-to-serial device. Then, integrator and dump are applied 
to demodulate and decision is made for each sample, which 
results in a estimated sequence ˆ
nb . 
 
C. Multiple Access System (K users) 
In this section, we expand the scheme in part A and B to include 
multiple access interference, shown in figure 5. The time delays, 
iτ , are modeled as random variables uniformly distributed on (0, 
Tb], and phase shifts, iα , are modeled as random variables 
uniformly distributed on (0, 2π]. Assume that the mth users 
transmit signals of the form of equation (9), with P , kβ and nc  
replaced by ( )mP ,  ( )mkβ and ( )mnc  respectively, 1 m K≤ ≤ . The

defined as

The above equation defined a phase function in the form of 
MSK. Therefore, we use DP-DS-SSMA/MSK to represent the 
system. Note that a differential encoder precodes the data 
sequence bn of the phase ( )tΘ . While ( )tΦ  is the phase function 
associated with the spreading sequence, and the format of the

The q(t) is the phase shaping function defined as in equation (2) 
with ( )g t  a Gaussian pulse function. McDowell and Lehnert 
actually separated the spreading phase from the information 
phase and derived that the spectral occupancy is dominated by 
the spreading phase. By using the same Gaussian shaping pulse, 
the spreading code, and the modulation index, the dual phase 
DS-SSMA scheme has similar bandwidth efficiency as DS-
SSMA/GMSK. Receiver for DP-DS-SSMA basically consists of 
two parts, a despreading component and a CPM detector. Since
