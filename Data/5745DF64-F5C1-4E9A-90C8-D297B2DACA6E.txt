Abstract 
This paper presents a disk-type magnetic 
levitation motor (MLM) to provide rotary mo-
tion. The proposed MLM offers numerous ad-
vantages. First, it can accomplish the levitation 
force and propulsive force by using only a sin-
gle power source. Second, with the circular 
structure, it can provide unlimited traveling 
distance without affecting the end effect for 
analyzing the general characteristics associated 
to the MLM. Third, the stabilization is im-
proved by taking additional mechanical design 
consideration without using another set of elec-
tromagnet and complicated control. A special 
test facility is designed and implemented for 
torque test, and the experimental measurements 
are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of 
constructing a MLM with the linear induction 
motors (LIMs). The experimental results show 
that the electrical characteristics of the pro-
posed MLM are almost agree with the theo-
retical results of a LIM and can be used in the 
further control-strategy development for the 
MLM.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The concept of linear electric motor is more 
than 150 years old. Linear electric motors be-
long to the group of special electrical machines 
that convert electrical energy directly into me-
chanical energy of translatory motion. Linear 
electric motors can be classified as follows [1]: 
1) d.c. motors, 
2) induction motors, 
3) synchronous motors, including reluc-
tance and stepping motors, 
4) oscillating motors, 
5) hybrid motors. 
The most popular one is linear induction mo-
tor (LIM), which is manufactured commer-
cially in several countries. Also, LIMs have 
found the widest prospects for applications in 
transportation systems, that is, magnetic levita-
tion systems [2,3]. Currently, the term “mag-
netic levitation” has been abbreviated as 
“maglev” in short. Here, the applications of 
maglev begin with electrical traction on small 
passenger or material supply cars used at air-
ports, exhibitions, electro highways, elevators 
and ends with pallet transportation, wafer 
transportation, belt conveyors, and transporta-
tion systems of bulk materials [4].  
In general, according to whether the utilized 
magnetic forces are attractive or repulsive, the 
magnetic levitation technologies can be classi-
fied into two categories, i.e., attractive and re-
pulsive magnetic levitation systems. Then, 
based on the combinations of the permanent 
magnets, DC electromagnet, and AC electro-
magnet, each type of the said magnetic levita-
tion systems has various kinds of possible ar-
 4
constructed by mounting 18 field poles in a cir-
cumference in the back iron (6). Each field pole 
consists of the H23 E-type laminated thin steel 
core (4) supported by the E-type laminated thin 
steel core holder (3) and field winding (5) ex-
cited by three-phase current. The trapezoid iron 
blocks (2) added on the top of each laminated 
thin steel core are used for providing better 
magnetic paths and improving the stabilization 
of lateral force, which have been verified in 
[10]. The insulator (7) is used to avoid the 
abrasion of the field winding. The diameter of 
the MLM is 40cm.  
The operational principle of the proposed 
disk-type MLM can be interpreted by the flow-
chart shown in Figure 3. By applying the 
three-phase ac current to the field windings, a 
magnetic field with flux density of 
1B
r  linked 
between the stator and the rotor will be pro-
duced. This magnetic flux density,
1B
r , is com-
posed of the traveling magnetic flux density 
(
11B
r ) and the time-varying magnetic flux den-
sity (
12B
r ).

posed disk-type MLM

conductor in 
1B
r , and the transformer emf et 
caused by the time variation of the excited 
magnetic flux density 
1B
r  will be produced in 
the rotor. Figure 4 shows the space distribution 
of the excited magnetic field 
1B
r  in the rotor 
along the φaˆ -axis at t = 0. As shown in Figure 
4(a), the motional emf ev will produce induced 
currents in the rotor, where directions of the 
induced currents are determined by the direc-
tion of 
1B
r . These induced currents will generate 
a magnetic field, then interact with 
1B
r  and re-
sult in attractive force to rotate the rotor. On the 
other hand, Figure 4(b) shows that the trans-
former emf et will also induce currents in the 
rotor, where directions of the induced currents 
are determined by the change rate of 
1B
r . These 
induced currents will create another magnetic 
field to interact with 
1B
r  and produce a repul-
sive force to levitate the rotor.  
Based on the operational principles shown in 
Figure 3 and the principles of the electromag-
netic theory, equations for the magnetic flux 
density, the thrust and levitation force of the 
PMLM can be derived [8]. The equation for the 
magnetic flux density is

larger torque T1. Further, the typical thrust ver-
sus speed characteristics of MLM with constant 
voltage to frequency ratio shown in Figure 5(c) 
cites that if the variable input voltages and vari-
able input frequencies have the same volt-
age-to-frequency ratio, they will have the same 
maximum thrust, T1 = T2, but the higher input 
frequency f1 will results in larger synchronous 
speed. 
In order to conduct the experimental test for 
the proposed MLM, test facility shown in Fig-
ure 6 is proposed. The test facility is combina-
tion of three parts, the inverter, the torque test 
facility, and the speed test facility. Here, the 
inverter (1) is used to excite the three phase 
windings with variable voltage and frequency.

(4)clamp, (5)knob, (6)torque indicator, 
(7)computer, and (8)tachometer. 
The torque test facility is designed such that 
the wheel (2) installed on the top of the torque 
test facility can adjust the relative position of 
the torque sensor (3) vertically. On the other 
hand, center of the rotor is positioned right un-
der the clamp (4) such that the knob (5) beside 
the clamp (4) can adjust the torque applied to 
the rotor. Here, torques sensed by the torque 
sensor can be displayed on the indicator (6), 
and then recorded in the computer (7) through 
the printer port connected between the indicator 
(6) and the computer (7).  
The speed test facility consists of a tachometer 
(8) for sensing the rotational speed and an in-
terface with the computer for recording the 
speed measurement. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
To demonstrate the characteristics of MLM 
constructed with the LIM, different experi-
ments with different operations are conducted. 
An inverter is used for providing variable volt-
age and variable frequency power to the MLM.  
The frequency-speed characteristics of the 
proposed MLM under different voltage to fre-
quency ratios are shown in Figure 7. For a con-
stant operation frequency, higher voltage to fre-
quency ratio implies higher applied voltage that 
will result in a higher rotational speed. Figure 7 
also reveals that for a constant voltage to fre-
quency ratio, the rotational speed is linearly 
proportional to the operation frequency. This 
linear characteristic implies that the proposed 
IMLM can achieve a good controllability. 
 
Figure 7. Frequency-speed characteristic of the 
proposed disk-type MLM under different volt-
age to frequency ratios. 
In inverter-fed MIM, the speed can be con-
trolled by varying the input voltage, input fre-
quency, and input frequency and voltage but 
keeping the voltage to frequency ratio constant. 
The characteristics of MLM operated in the 
said three conditions are presented in the fol-
lows.  
Referring to the experimental results shown 
in Figure 8(a), (b), and (c), the rotational 
speed-torque characteristics of the proposed 
disk-type MLM under constant voltage and 
variable frequencies, 60Hz, 70Hz, 80Hz and 
90Hz. The results reveal that the maximum ro-
tational speed is increased as the input fre-
quency increased for each constant voltage, 
160V, 180V and 200V. These figures also re-
veal that higher frequency will result in small

under constant voltage to frequency ratio, 
shown in Figure 13, here the MLM is operated 
in the same voltage to frequency ratio = 2 but 
with different input voltage and input fre-
quency (V=180V, F= 90Hz and V=160V, F= 
80Hz). The experimental results reveal that 
higher frequency has resulted in larger torque 
but both of these two cases finally reached the 
same maximum torque, which are agreed with 
the prediction in Figure 5(c). 
From the experimental results shown in Fig-
ure 8, 9 and 10, the electrical characteristics of 
the proposed MLM almost agree with the theo-
retical results shown in Figure 5. Hence, the 
information can be very useful in the further 
control-strategy development for the MLM.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a disk-type magnetic levitation 
motor (MLM) to provide rotary motion is pre-
sented. The thrust and levitation force of the 
MLM are obtained through the interaction be-
tween the traveling magnetic field generated by 
the ac currents in the primary windings and the 
induced currents on the secondary. The pro-
posed MLM offers numerous advantages. First, 
it can accomplish the levitation force and pro-
pulsive force by using only a single power 
source. Second, with the circular structure, it 
can provide unlimited traveling distance with-
out affecting the end effect for analyzing the 
general characteristics associated to the MLM. 
Third, the stabilization is improved by taking 
additional mechanical design consideration 
without using another set of electromagnet and 
complicated control. The electrical characteris-
tics of the proposed MLM are obtained by us-
ing a particular test setup designed in our Lab. 
The experimental measurements are provided 
to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a 
MLM with the LIM. The experimental results 
show that the electrical characteristics of the 
proposed MLM almost agree with the theoreti-
cal results of a MIM and can be used in the 
further control-strategy development for the 
MLM.
