Abstract 
Firewall is one of the most principal elements of the current Internet, which can protect the entire 
network against all external or internal attacks or threats. For the consistency between network security 
policies and firewall configuration, rule editing, ordering and distribution must be done very carefully on 
each of the firewalls, especially in a large-scale and multi-firewall-equipped network. However, a network 
administrator is prone to incorrectly configuring the firewalls because there are usually thousands or 
hundreds of filtering/admission rules (i.e., rules in Access Control List: ACL) which should be setup in a 
firewall, not mention these rules among firewalls which affect mutually can make the matter worse. In this 
case, the network administrator would hardly know his/her mis-configuration until the network functions 
beyond the expectation. 
For this reason, our work is to build a verification system for checking the consistency of firewalls’ 
configuration. The system collects the filtering/admission rules (or ACL rules) from all of the firewalls in 
the managed network and analyzes these rules to check 1) if they obey the goal of the global network 
security policies and 2) if inter-rule anomalies exist. For the first point, we depict the topological 
relationships between firewalls by utilizing the flow dependence graph. And then with these relationships, 
we compare the goal of the global security policies and the interpretation of those ACL rules which are 
involved to figure out the improper firewall rule configuration. For the second point, analysis of inter-rule 
anomalies is done and visualized to complete our system’s functionality. Currently, some of the firewall 
configuration from our campus network has being used to demonstrate our system’s implementation and 
performance.

(3) Generalization anomaly: Rule 2 generally contains Rule 1, in Fig. 1, except they have different actions 
to take. 
(4) Redundancy anomaly: in Fig. 1, Rule 7 is fully redundant due to the existence of Rule 6, and Rule 9 is 
also redundant because Rule 10 exists. 
(5) Irrelevance anomaly: In Fig 1, Rule 11 doesn＇t work at all due to its irrelevant setting on 
source/destination addresses for the example network. 
 
 About anomalies among different ACLs, there are four different categories. Fig. 2 is used to explain 
them. 
(1) Shadowing anomaly: It ＇ s defined as some specific traffic permitted to pass through the 
down-streamed filtering rule is prohibited by the up-streamed rule. One example for the anomaly is the 
combination of Rule 3 at router R1 and Rule 2 at router R2 in Fig. 2. They have mutual effects on the 
passing traffic. 
(2) Spuriousness anomaly: It＇s defined as some specific traffic prohibited to flow through the 
down-streamed filtering rule is permitted by the up-streamed rule. One example for the anomaly is the 
combination of Rule 2 at router R1 and Rule 4 at router R0 in Fig. 2. 
(3) Redundancy anomaly: In Fig. 2, Rule 6 at router R1 is completely redundant since Rule 6 at router R2 
exists. 
(4) Correlation anomaly: Ex., the following two rules are highly correlated but it could result in totally 
opposite effects for the whole network if these two rules exchange their corresponding position in the 
network.

3. System Operation Modeling 
 To complete our system prototype, the system operating flow should be modeled at the very 
beginning. As shown in Fig. 3, for a network manager, he/she can first input the specification of the 
demand of the global network security policies. Meanwhile, the validation system collects all the needed 
management information (including SNMP MIB and ACLs) from the managed network automatically to 
depict the logical topology of the network. After that, the system compares the interpreted equivalent of 
the global policies with that of the ACLs involved. If there are anomalies among ACL rules or 
mismatching between the behavior constrained by the global policies and that of the ACLs, the system 
systematically reports them via its visualization GUI (Graphic User Interface). After getting the analytical 
report, the network manager can continue making proper corrections on the relative ACLs until there is no 
error warned. 
3.1 System Architecture 
        
 Fig. 3 shows the component subsystems to make our validation system function. In this section, the 
major tasks of each subsystem will be recapped one by one. For the Network Monitor subsystem, its major 
tasks include: 
(1)Collect the SNMP MIB including the proprietary MIB for ACLs, from all the firewalls (and all the 
routers) within the managed network. 
(2)Use the collected MIB to picture the logical network topology along with the location of each ACL for 
the further analyses of rule anomalies and behavior mismatching. 
(3)Redraw the network topology when the subsystem learns that there is a topological change of the 
network occurring. 
 For the Anomaly Analysis subsystem, its major tasks are: 
(1)Referring to the network topology built by the Network Management model, do the pair-wise 
  The network manager can click on the red link to open the corresponding Inter-ACL view for a close 
examination. The manager can also click on a problematic node (colored yellow) to open either the 
Inter-ACL view or the Intra-ACL view of that node, or both, for further checking. In addition, throughout 
the Visualization GUI subsystem, colors are used to represent the categories of anomalies, i.e., one color is 
dedicated to one specific category of anomalies. This can provide users another point of view in checking 
anomalies. Lastly, if the network manager wants to see the contents of the anomalous rules, he/she can 
move the mouse cursor onto the problematic rule icons to obtain the detailed information. Via our 
visualization model, the network manager can easily find where and what anomalies are and make timely 
corrections on them. 
3.3 Behavior Mismatching Analysis 
 In this section, we’ll describe how the Behavior Matching subsystem works. As mentioned in 
Section 2.2, mismatched behavior is classified into two types: incorrectly blocking error and incorrectly 
admitting error. To detect and recognize these two different types of errors, a two-dimensional flow map 
model has been proposed for the “semantic” comparisons between the demand of the global network 
security policies and the involved ACLs. In the two-dimensional flow map, its x-axis represents the source 
IP address space and y-axis is meant for the destination IP address space. These two axes compose a plane 
where each point on the plane stands for some traffic flow which is specified by the corresponding IP 
address coordinates (i.e., <source IP address, destination IP address>). Thus, the smaller white rectangles 
shown in Fig. 5 mean the open areas through which the HTTP traffic is permitted to go and the bigger 
gray rectangles mean the closed areas where the HTTP traffic is prohibited. Please notice that, for each 
network port, service, or protocol, there would be a corresponding two-dimensional flow map.
