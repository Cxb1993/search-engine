LED Package.  A novel package and 
thermal analysis based on ANSYS software 
for high-power white LED were presented.   
II. METHOD 
The designs of LED packages resulted in 
significantly different thermal behaviors.   
A good packaging technology is the way to 
solve the heat dissipation problem, but it is a 
challenge to develop this technology in the 
limited space of LED package.  The heat 
performance of LED package utilizing 
technology on novel composite materials with 
high thermal conductivity was studied. The 
design of the LED itself is important for the 
heat path through the assembly.  The 
thermal resistance (θ ) of that adhesive is the 
bottleneck of the thermal heat flow from the 
LED junction to the cooler.  In order to 
demonstrate the thermal performance of the 
LED package technologies, the method of 
numerical analysis is used for estimation and 
design of LED component.  Based on LED 
package products of “Everlight Electronics 
Co.Ltd” , a novel package and thermal 
analysis used on FEM (finite element method) 
software for enhanced high power LED were 
presented.  Heat performance of different 
size of die chip, enhancement management, 
and heat sink materials were compared.   
For specifying of LEDs package, Fig.1 and 
FIG. 2   shows the LED array and FEM 
model using “COMSOL” software.  The 
packages under investigation employ 
different configuration of GaN-based chip as 
Fig.3 and Table 1 which are based on 
AlGaInP series LED chip of “Epistar 
Corporation” .

components are sensitive to heat, it’s 
important to remove any excess heat that can 
adversely impact performance.   The 
majority of the energy becomes heat that 
must be removed from the light source.  
Heat is transferred in one of three methods: 
By conduction, convection or radiation.  
Electrical optical characteristics of LEDs 
depend on the ambient operating temperature.  
The model was verified using a LED package 
under natural, mixed, and forced convection 
conditions.  LED diode performance is a 
function of the device thermal conditions.  
The forward voltage and light emission of the 
LED vary with temperature and current.  
The temperature distribution is shown in 
Fig.6.  It was then used to predict the 
thermal performance of LED packages of 
widely varying size and package thermal 
enhancement.  The simulation values are 
compared and corrected with the product 
values of industry and the data.  Figure 
7indicates the results of temperature 
distribution as a good agreement between the 
model and the industry package performance 
in natural, mixed, and forced convection 
regimes.  The model outlines the natural and 
mixed convection region between 0 to 
saturation 15 m/s air velocity, over which 
chip junction temperature is a function of 
applied power.  The junction temperature 
must not rise above the allowable maximum 
of 125°C.  Basically, the maximum 
allowable junction temperature should not be 
exceeded, as this can lead to irreversible 
damage to the LED and spontaneous failures.  
To minimize the junction temperature of high 
power device, an interesting concept using a 
forced convection was proposed.

To ensure the best efficiency of thermal 
management of LED component, the model 
was used to predict the thermal performance 
of LED packages on standard FR4 PCB 
( mmmmmm 5.17676 ×× )of widely varying 
power generation and cooling thermal 
enhancement condition.  The trace 
metallization was measured at an 
approximate thickness of 42 mµ  (1.2 oz. 
Copper).  The packages are specified 
different power generation chip in package on 
PCB.  The heat that is generated on the die 
surface reaches the immediate environment 
along two paths: (1) convection and radiation 
off the exposed surface of the package and (2) 
conduction into and through the test board 
followed by convection and radiation off the 
exposed board surfaces. The used PCB 
technology plays a significant role for 
conduction heat transfer.  In addition to the 
standard substrate, such as FR4 PCB material,

embedded heat slug is intended to lower the 
thermal resistance (θ) of package without a 
change of package.  Heat slug used in LED 
package is an excellent solution for 
cost-effective high power generated LED 
package.   Heat sinks provide a path for 
heat from the LED to flow through 
conduction.  Moreover, the comparison 
discussion, a thermal modeling technique for 
LED packaging with the use of a heat slug 
will be highlighted.  Heat sinks or slug can 
dissipate power in three ways: conduction, 
convection, or radiation.  Different high 
thermal conductive heat sink included in LED 
package and mounted on test PCB was 
studied.   As shown in Fig.10, heat flux 
from the heat slug was found to be significant, 
and then the LED chip temperature obvious 
runs much cooler.  Comparisons were also 
made for the highest temperature distribution 
with different materials of heat slug.  
Because the effects of heat slug and mixed 
convection, the enhanced thermal resistance 
of LED package was reduced up to 30% than 
the conventional package for each PCB, 
respectively.  Airflow is another factor 
effecting thermal resistance.  The more 
airflow a heat sink is exposed to, the lower 
the thermal resistance.  Table 3 illustrates 
the effects with coupled mixed convection 
and heat slug.  Enhancing thermal 
conductivity between the embedded heat slug 
and the LED is very preferable for thermal 
management.

In order to achieve package reliability 
and optimal performance for LED, 
appropriate thermal management is necessary.   
Figure 11 and Table 4 illustrate the 
relationship between the maximum power 
and the chip size.  As the chip volume 
increases, the junction temperature is reduced.  
This is due to the fact that with increasing 
volume of the chip as the primary heat 
transfer path for heat flow to the ambient.  
These results have implications beyond the 
concern of increasing the power-handling 
capability of the package.  The use of 
increasing chip size on a package will change 
this partitioning of heat flow and reduce the 
fraction of the total power dissipated within a 
package flowing through the board.  Figure 
12 was plotted correlation between chip size 
and thermal resistance.  As chip size was 
increased, the heat transfer area and path 
were also increase.  The technique would be 
modified so that the die power density or 
power dissipation per unit die area, (qi/Ai), 
where Ai is the surface area of the chip.  For 
the chip sizes increasing, the package itself 
contributes thermal resistance due to the 
contribution of chip.  This will lead to a 
design rule of device development for the 
different LED chip.

for the thermal management of microelectronic 
packages and high brightness light emitting diode 
(HB-LED) packages.  Liu et al.(6) demonstrated a new 
thermal management application of silicon-based 
thermoelectric (TE) cooler integrated with high power 
light emitting diode,  Biber(7) discussed how to choose 
the desired operating temperature, by examining the 
effect of varying the thermal boundary conditions on 
the light emission.  The relationships are important to 
making design decisions about the LED thermal 
packaging. 
 The efficiency and reliability of solid-state 
lighting devices strongly depend on successful thermal 
management.  High-brightness light emitting diodes, 
as a strong candidate for the next generation general 
illumination applications, were developed by 
improving luminous efficiency and integrating 
multi-chips within limited areas.  Yuan(8) explored the 
thermal analysis of high power LED array packaging 
with a microchannel cooler, which is a relatively new 
cooling technology.  Kim and Shin(9) discussed 
thermal transient measurements of high power 
GaN-based LEDs with multi-chip designs. High 
sophisticated FEM (Finite Element Method) 
simulations are indispensable for modern development 
of high power LED applications.  Dieker et al.(10) 
compared simulations of various substrate materials 
and packaging technologies simulated using 
FLOTHERM software. Thereby different substrates 
such as standard FR4 (Flame Retardant 4), ceramic and 
metal core printed circuit boards are considered.  
Chen(11) also focused on thermal management of 
high-power white LED Package.  A novel package 
and thermal analysis based on ANSYS software for 
high-power white LED were presented.   
II. METHOD 
The designs of LED packages resulted in 
significantly different thermal behaviors.   A good 
packaging technology is the way to solve the heat 
dissipation problem, but it is a challenge to develop 
this technology in the limited space of LED package.  
The heat performance of LED package utilizing 
technology on novel composite materials with high 
thermal conductivity was studied. The design of the 
LED itself is important for the heat path through the 
assembly.  The thermal resistance ( θ ) of that 
adhesive is the bottleneck of the thermal heat flow 
from the LED junction to the cooler.  In order to 
demonstrate the thermal performance of the LED 
package technologies, the method of numerical 
analysis is used for estimation and design of LED 
component.  Based on LED package products of 
“Everlight Electronics Co.Ltd” , a novel package and 
thermal analysis used on FEM (finite element method) 
software for enhanced high power LED were presented.  
Heat performance of different size of die chip, 
enhancement management, and heat sink materials 
were compared.   For specifying of LEDs package, 
Fig.1 shows the FEM model using “COMSOL” 
software.  The packages under investigation employ 
different configuration of GaN-based chip as Fig.2 and 
Table 1 which are based on AlGaInP series LED chip

To ensure the best efficiency of thermal 
management of LED component, the model was used 
to predict the thermal performance of LED packages 
on standard FR4 PCB ( mmmmmm 5.17676 ×× )of 
widely varying power generation and cooling thermal 
enhancement condition.  The trace metallization was 
measured at an approximate thickness of 42 mµ  (1.2 
oz. Copper).  The packages are specified different 
power generation chip in package on PCB.  The heat 
that is generated on the die surface reaches the 
immediate environment along two paths: (1) 
convection and radiation off the exposed surface of the 
package and (2) conduction into and through the test 
board followed by convection and radiation off the 
exposed board surfaces. The used PCB technology 
plays a significant role for conduction heat transfer.  
In addition to the standard substrate, such as FR4 PCB 
material, thermal enhanced substrate technologies can 
be used for heat management in its luminaires to 
ensure that the LED modules remain below the critical 
temperature range and operate at full capacity 
throughout their lives.  Mounting the LED module 
directly on metal-core PCBs effectively dissipates the 
heat to the luminaire housing.  Thermal performance 
of the package in a print circuit board, and considering 
conductivity effects of thick copper core, the different 
dimensions of PCB were shown in Table 2.  The print 
circuit foil with thickness of 1oz to 10 oz in thermal 
clad (1oz copper is defined as 1 ounce of copper 
deposited over 1 square foot of surface area).  Thick 
copper core of power and ground layer of surface 
mounted PCB will lead devices optimize heat control 
by providing low thermal resistance, alleviating a 
primary concern in LED applications.  Thick copper 
(high-build copper) printed circuit boards are used in 
high power circuits to allow high currents to path 
through the conductors without significant heating 
effects.  The ground plane is the most convenient 
thermal conductor and should be placed as close as 
possible to the surface attached to the LED package.  
Figure 7 also indicates the effects of thermal 
performance of coupled PCB structure and mix 
convection (cooling air velocity, s/m15V = ).  
Thicker copper plating will lower the thermal 
resistance, and reduce the junction temperature and 
thermal resistance up to 55%, and offer good 
performance for LED light sources.  The effects of 
coupled cooling air velocity and surface mounted PCB 
on thermal resistance were also shown in Fig.8.  
Thick copper metal core PCB offers better thermal 
management performance than standard board about 
10% even at forced cooling convection condition.  
The design should use thick copper power and ground 
planes and it should have a large surface area available 
to better dissipate heat.  By using thick copper based 
thermal core PCB, extend performance, easily, 
durability and reliability solutions were found for LED 
lighting application.

CONCLUSIONS 
The enhanced thermal performance of the LED 
component has been rationalized by reference to the 
significantly different design of the LED package. 
Designers working on high power LED systems need 
to understand the thermal problems with LEDs.  
Because of the high power operation, suitable thermal 
management is mandatory in order to achieve and 
guarantee optimal performance and reliability of the 
module.  A thermal model was shown to accurately 
predict the thermal performance of LED package 
attached PCB.  The present results show the enhanced 
thermal design and correlations of new product 
development for industry.
