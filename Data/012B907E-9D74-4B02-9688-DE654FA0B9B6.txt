Abstract
Generally, the state-space averaged model,
which is an approximate model, is employed to
synthesize the PWM (pulse-width-modulated)
DC-DC converters. Instead, an algorithm based
on orthogonal-functions approach (OFA) only
involving algebraic computation is proposed in
this project to precisely solve the discontinuous
dynamic equations of the PWM DC-DC
converters. On the other hand, to accommodate
the load variation of a PWM DC-DC converter,
a fuzzy-immune-PID controller by fusing the
conventional PID controller, the fuzzy logic
theory and the immune feedback law is
considered as a self-adaptive controller in this
project. Based on the OFA, the optimal
fuzzy-immune-PID controller design problem
for a class of PWM DC-DC converters is
transformed into a static-parameters
optimization problem represented by algebraic
equations. Then for the static optimization
problem, the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm
(HTGA) is employed to find the optimal
parameters of the fuzzy-immune-PID
controllers for the PWM DC-DC converters
under the criterion of minimizing an integral
quadratic performance index. The proposed
integrative method, which fuses the OFA and
the HTGA, is non-differential, non-integral,
straightforward, and well-adapted to computer
implementation. The results show that the
proposed method gives an effective way for
synthesizing the optimal parameters of the
fuzzy-immune-PID controllers of the PWM
DC-DC converters.

二、計畫緣由與目的
Power semiconductor devices and
switching power converters have been widely
and popularly used in modern industrial
systems [1]. The highly nonlinear characteristic
of the DC-DC converter makes them become a
challenging research subject from the control
point of view. Especially, when the operating
range of DC-DC converters is large, reaching
fine regulation control is a difficult task.
Therefore, traditional PI [2] or PID [3], sliding
mode [2-4], dead-beat [5] and fuzzy logic [2],
[6-8] control approaches have been employed
to the regulation control of DC-DC converters.
Conventionally, the model being widely used to
analyze and/or control DC-DC converters is the
state space averaged model [6]-[9], which is an
4system matrix corresponding to the subsystems
1S and 2S . MR denotes the static drain to
source resistance of the power MOSFET and
LR is the parasitic resistances of the inductor.
Assume that the time interval of interest,
],0[ fT , is divided into p intervals, i.e.,
sf TpT  , where sT is the sampling period.
In Fig. 1, the operation of the PWM block
between its input e(t) and output )(ˆtu is

If the gains ,K ,ik ,dk  and L of

given, then, given the input )(tvref and the
initial state )0(x , the coefficient matrices qx

.1BBi  Calculate xˆ from Eq. (16).
(ii) Set ,fqf tt  and compute .ˆ)(ˆ)( TfTnf xttx 

having 0)( sqT for q<0.
Step 6:
Set q=q+1. If q>p then stop; otherwise go to
Step 3.
This means that if, given the input )(tvref
and the initial state ),0(x one set of
},,,,{ LkkK di  is specified, then q , qx , qx~ ,
qu and qu~ ( pq ,2,,1  ) can be determined
and then the value of the performance index in
(17) corresponding to this set of },,,,{ LkkK di 
can be calculated. Given another set of
},,,,{ LkkK di  with the given input )(tvref
and the given initial state ),0(x there obtains
another value of the performance index in (17).
That is, the value of the performance index in
(17) is actually dependent on },,,,{ LkkK di 
which means
),,,,( LkkKFJ di  (19)
under the given input )(tvref and the given
initial state )0(x . Hence, the optimal
fuzzy-immune-PID control problem of the
PWM DC-DC converter is to search for the
optimal },,,,{ LkkK di  under the given input
)(tvref and the given initial state )0(x such
that the performance index in (17) is minimized.
This is equivalent to the problem

changes from 50V to 40 V at 0.02s and back to
50V at 0.04s; meanwhile, Fig. 7 shows the load
regulation results when the load resistance
changes from 6 to 15 at 0.02 sec and
back to 6 at 0.04 sec. From Figs. 5-7, it is
found that the proposed approach, which fuses
the OFA and the HTGA, gives an effective way
to design the optimal parameters of the
fuzzy-immune-PID controller for the PWM
DC-DC converters.

五、結論與討論
Based on the OFA, an algorithm involving
only algebraic computation is presented in this
paper to precisely solve the discontinuous
dynamic equations of the PWM DC-DC
converters. Furthermore, the presented
algorithm is incorporated with the HTGA to
synthesizing the optimal parameters of the
fuzzy-immune-PID controllers under the
minimization of an integral quadratic cost
functional. Since the proposed method only
involves algebraic computation, the design
procedures of the optimal fuzzy-immune-PID
controllers for the PWM DC-DC converters can
be either greatly reduced or much simplified
accordingly. The results have shown that the
proposed approach is effective for synthesizing
the optimal fuzzy-immune-PID controllers of
the PWM DC-DC converters.
