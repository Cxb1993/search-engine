使用 subexpression space 之定點式 FIR 濾波器設計 
 
英文摘要 
Digital filters are essential in a DSP or a communication system. Therefore, to implement a 
digital filter in a DSP or a communication system effectively becomes an emerging issue in the 
research area of digital filter design. In the past two decades, many results of FIR filter 
fixed-point coefficient design and realization were published. First, the coefficients are 
represented in binary formats or in canonic sign digit (CSD) formats. Since each nonzero digit of 
the fixed-point coefficients costs an adder, in the coefficient design phase, people try to minimize 
the number of nonzero digits. Next, fixed-point coefficients are realized by a common 
subexpression elimination (CSE) method or by a graph method to reduce the hardware 
complexity. However, since the fixed-point coefficients are designed and realized separately, the 
resultant hardware may not be the most cost effective one. 
In this report, we suggest a fixed-point coefficient design process that considers the 
implementation complexity at the first stage of the design phase. We combine two existing 
methods. One is using the subexpression space to construct the fixed-point FIR coefficients; the 
other is finding the upper bound and lower bound of each coefficient to accelerate the design 
process.

數位濾波器廣泛地應用於數位訊號處理（DSP）系統與通訊系統中，因此，在 DSP 或
通訊系統中如何有效地實現數位濾波器便成為濾波器設計領域中重要的課題，過去二十多
年來，在 FIR 定點式係數設計和實現上有許多研究成果發表，首先，FIR 濾波器的係數先
以二元或典型帶符號數元（CSD）的格式表示，由於每一個非零數元即需要一個加法器來
實現，故在係數設計時大家無不力求降低係數的非零項數目。一但 FIR 濾波器的定點係數
已設計好，接下來就是想辦法以最結省加法器的方式實現濾波器以降低硬體複雜度，這方
面有兩類的方法：一是共通表示消除（common subexpression elimination, CSE）法，另一是
圖形法。但對於同時跨足係數設計與實現的學者包括主持人在內，對「把濾波器定點係數
的設計與實現分開不一定最終會導致最結省的硬體」的事實都心知肚明。 
本報告提出整合定點係數的設計與實現於一體的結果，我們結合兩種已知的方法，一
為利用 subexpression space 來構建 FIR 濾波器的定點係數，另一為尋找每一係數的上下界以
加速整個係數設計的過程。

I. Introduction 
FIR 數位濾波器架構圖中無可避免的會畫上代表係數乘法的部分，鑑於乘法器的面積
較大，且在 FIR 濾波器中一般使用許多的乘法，故定點式 FIR 濾波器實踐上的一大問題是
如何避免使用乘法器，而以加法器及 hard wire 取代之。過去這方面有許多研究，大致可分
為兩大類，一為定點式係數的設計 [1]-[11]，另一為以加法器及 hard wire 完成定點式係數

有了這些上下界，當我們在尋找定點係數 hi時，我們可檢查 hi是否已越界，若越界，
則可停止這個方向的搜尋，向另一方向或搜尋下一個定點係數，如此能加快搜尋速度。 
C. 整個演算法的運做模式如下： 
首先，以 subexpression space 中的元素量化係數 h(i) 會有兩個候選人，分別在 h(i)左右
兩側，一個比較接近 h(i)，另一稍遠，令 hi,lower表示最接近 h(i) 的一個，hi,upper 表示稍遠的
一個，定義函式 b&b (branch and bound)如下： 
b&b(i) {

  Infeasible;

if (hmin(i) ≤ hi, lower ≤ hmax(i)) { 
  hi = hi;lower;

 } 
 if (hmin(i) ≤ hi, upper ≤ hmax(i)) { 
  hi = hi;upper; 
  body; 
 } 
} 
其中程序 body 定義如下： 
procedure body: 
Ai = # of adders for realizing { h0, h1, …, hi }; 
 if ( i < b(N ¡ 1)=2c) {

演算法如下： 
1. 給定濾波器的 passband edge frequency、stopband edge frequency、δ p和δ s後，首先根據(2)

舉 [11] 中的簡例為例，該例為一對稱的 10-tap 低通濾波器，係數位元數為 6 個 bit，

−2.4538, 2.6269, 12.6764, 21.1598}，依前述演算法進行設計；首先設定 S = {1, 3, 5}，一開
始，h0,lower = −2, h0,upper = −3，接下來求 h(1)、hmin(1)、hmax(1)，h1,lower = −3, h1,upper = −2，依
此類推，過程的示意圖如圖 2。最後所求得之定點係數前半為 {−2, −3, 2, 13, 22}。而其表
示法分別為： 
 
2 = 1£ 21
3 = 1£ 22 ¡ 1£ 20
13 = 1£ 24 ¡ 3£ 20
22 = 1£ 24 + 3£ 21 
總共需要 3 個加法，比 [11] 中所找到的解更簡單。 
 
subexpression space 的觀念為根據，輔以 [11] 中先找出係數上下界的方式，可成功設計出
比 [11] 更簡單，而與 [23] 複雜度相同的硬體。 
本研究中的演算法完全以 Matlab 寫成，我們預定把演算法改用 C 實現，以得到更快
的執行速度。

Abstract— A method for designing square-root (SR) FIR filters that
are less sensitive to receiver clock jitter is proposed. Unlike previously
published methods that use only frequency domain constraints, the
proposed method considers time-domain constraints as well, including
the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the opening of the eye pattern at
the receiver output. Design examples show that using the time-domain
constraints can result in a more robust eye opening and thus a robust
ISI performance in the presence of receiver clock jitter.
I. INTRODUCTION
A matched pair of square-root (SR) ﬁlters of a Nyquist ﬁlter,
used in the transmitter and the receiver of a band-limited digital
communication system (see Fig. 1), can provide zero inter-symbol
interference (ISI) [1]. In practice, the SR ﬁlters are realized in
FIR form. Conventionally, the SR ﬁlters are designed by directly
designing the Nyquist ﬁlter with a nonnegative frequency response
(ignoring the linear-phase factor) [2]–[6], then getting the matched SR
transmitter and receiver ﬁlters by performing a spectral factorization
on the Nyquist ﬁlter polynomial.
Although zero ISI is theoretically desired, in practice, it is not
always necessary. In [7], [8], a recognition of the “required ISI” was
proposed. The required ISI should depend on the operating point
(BER vs SNR) of a band-limited digital communication system. As
long as the ISI is sufﬁciently small (not necessarily zero), the BER
performance of a communication system can be acceptable at the
operating point. A small but non-zero ISI can give us an increased
degree of freedom in designing the SR ﬁlters.
In practical implementations of band-limited communication sys-
tems, since there is some interference and noise in the channel, the
recovered receiver clock signal must suffer from some timing jitter.
Thus, the synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver
cannot be perfect. This receiver timing jitter will deteriorate the BER
performance if the opening of the eye pattern is not sufﬁciently large.
On the other hand, the quality of the eye pattern is governed by the
SR ﬁlter design method. Therefore, in addition to the conventional
frequency domain speciﬁcations and the ISI constraint, the eye
opening should also be considered in designing SR ﬁlters.
In this paper, a new method for designing an SR ﬁlter is proposed.
The method takes the ﬁlter’s stopband attenuation, the required
ISI, and the eye opening into account simultaneously. The paper is
organized as follows: In Section II, the formulation of the proposed
method is presented. Numerical design examples are given in Section
III. Finally, a summary of conclusions is given in Section IV.

II. THE DESIGN OF SR FILTERS WITH ROBUST EYE OPENINGS
Let denote the length of the SR ﬁlter. The formula for calcu-
lating the ISI [9] is:
ISI (1)
where represents the number of samples per symbol (i.e.,
samples are sent for each symbol), denotes
the coefﬁcients of the Nyquist ﬁlter and , ,
deﬁnes the SR ﬁlter at the transmitter and , ,
the SR ﬁlter at the receiver. It is known that to
meet the matched-ﬁlter criterion. Thus, .
Therefore, is of length and is symmetrical about
.
It is known [5] that the value of is equal to . Since
we adopt the required ISI as a design parameter, if the required ISI
is denoted as , then (1) can be written as
(2)
Next, let us develop a measurement for the eye-opening robustness
of an eye pattern. Consider the two normalized eye patterns shown
in Fig. 2, where the over-sampling ratio is six. Hence, the time
indices 0, 6, and 12 correspond to perfectly synchronous sampling
instants. These two eye patterns result from two different Nyquist
ﬁlters that possess the same ISI at a multiple of . One can see that
the eye shown in Fig. 2(b) opens wider than that shown in Fig. 2(a).
Since system performance in the presence of receiver timing jitter
is of great interest, the time indices one step away from those
perfectly synchronous sampling instants are used to measure the eye-
opening robustness (as is indicated in Fig. 2). The measure of eye-
opening robustness is similarly deﬁned as ISI in [9] and has the form

(17)
After changing the second and third constraints of (9) into (10)
through (17), one can use any standard linear programming problem
solver to obtain the Nyquist ﬁlter coefﬁcients. Next, the matched SR
transmitter and receiver ﬁlters, and , are determined by
performing a spectral factorization on the Nyquist ﬁlter polynomial.
Regarding the numerical accuracy issues mentioned in [5], we refer
the reader to the more recent treatment of spectral factorization given
in [11].
III. DESIGN EXAMPLES
Example 1: In [7], [8], we showed that the BER performance of
a BPSK communication system was not deteriorated under dB
ISI when SNR = 10 dB. In this example, three SR ﬁlters are designed
for the BPSK application. The system speciﬁcations are: SNR = 10
dB, the minimum stopband attenuation (SBATT) of the SR ﬁlter is
23.5 dB, the roll-off factor , and the over-sampling ratio
.
The ﬁrst SR ﬁlter is designed by the conventional method with
zero ISI. Its length is 24. The second SR ﬁlter is designed by the
proposed method with dB ISI. However, the constraint over the
eye opening is not speciﬁed. Hence, the optimization still follows
(9) but the third constraint of (9) is ignored. The outcome ﬁlter has
21 taps. This design process is designated a ‘method without EYE
control’. The last one is also designed by the proposed method with
dB ISI. Now, the third constraint of (9) is taken into account
and is set as 1.27 dB. The resultant ﬁlter has 23 taps. This
design process is designated a ‘method with EYE control’. All three
SR ﬁlter coefﬁcients are shown in Table I.
Next, receiver clock jitter is applied. The receiver clock may not
be synchronous with the symbol timing at the transmitter. This will
degrade the ISI performance. Fig. 3 shows the simulation results
for the three communication systems employing the three SR ﬁlters
mentioned above, in the presence of receiver clock jitter. The x-axis
is the standard deviation of the receiver clock jitter divided by .
For the conventional SR ﬁlter, although the ISI is extremely low
at low clock jitter, it degrades very fast as the jitter increases. For
the SR ﬁlter designed by the method without EYE control, when the
receiver timing jitter reaches , the ISI degrades from dB
to dB. Recall that, in [7], [8], dB ISI won’t deteriorate the
BER performance at the operating point of 10 dB SNR. On the other
hand, for the SR ﬁlter designed by the method with EYE control,
the ISI degrades to dB at timing jitter, extending the
jitter-suffering limit of the previous case by two thirds. It is noted
that from to timing jitter, the ISI degradation curve
resulting from the SR ﬁlter with EYE control virtually coincides with
the ISI degradation curve resulting from the conventional SR ﬁlter.
After timing jitter, it performs even better!
Notably, the ﬁlter length of the conventional SR ﬁlter is the longest
one among the three SR ﬁlters. When we relax the zero ISI constraint,
we obtain the second SR ﬁlter whose length is the shortest. However,
when the receiver clock jitter is applied, the ISI performance (and thus
the BER performance) degrades quickly. When we use the proposed
method to design the third SR ﬁlter, we can have a tradeoff between
the eye opening and the ﬁlter length. In this example, the ﬁlter length
is increased from 21 (the length of the second SR ﬁlter) to 23 with
dB. The improvement of the ISI performance in the
presence of receiver clock jitter can be observed in Fig. 3. It is also

COEFFICIENTS OF THREE SR FILTERS IN EXAMPLE 1
SR ﬁlter coefﬁcients by the conventional method
SR ﬁlter coefﬁcients by the method without EYE control
SR ﬁlter coefﬁcients by the method with EYE control
noted that, in this example, the ﬁlter length of the third SR ﬁlter is
still shorter than that of the conventional ﬁlter.
Example 2: Two SR ﬁlters for high level QAM are presented. The
speciﬁcations are: , , dB, and
dB. One SR ﬁlter is a conventional SR ﬁlter with 16 taps.
The other SR ﬁlter, possessing 35 taps, is designed by the proposed
method with dB. A 1024-QAM system is assumed in
this example.
The eye patterns of a channel in a 1024-QAM system employing
the conventional SR ﬁlter and the SR ﬁlter designed by the proposed
method are shown in Fig. 4. One can see that using the SR ﬁlter
designed by the proposed method results in a wider eye opening
than that of the conventional SR ﬁlter.
The reader may notice that the two ﬁlter lengths are different in
this example. The length of the ﬁlter with eye control is much longer
than that of the conventional ﬁlter. If we increase the length of the
conventional ﬁlter, then its SBATT is lowered. However, the number
of terms in the denominator of (3) increases when we increase the
ﬁlter length . Therefore, the EYE value will decrease if we do not
control EYE. Hence, the proposed eye-control method is useful for
a tradeoff design among the ﬁlter length, the SBATT, and the EYE
value.
