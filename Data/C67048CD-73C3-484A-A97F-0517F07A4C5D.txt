1. Preface 
Protein-protein interactions play an important role in predicting protein function. 
Identification of protein-protein interaction sites and detection of specific amino acid 
residues that participate in protein interactions is an important problem ranging from 
rational drug design to analysis of metabolic and signal transduction networks. 
Experimental proteomics projects have already resulted in complete ‘interactomes’. 
While such efforts yield a catalog of interacting proteins, experimental detection of 
residues in protein-protein interaction surfaces must come from determination of the 
structure of protein-protein complexes. However, determination of protein-complex 
structures using X-ray and NMR methods lags far behind the number of known 
protein sequences. Hence, there is a need for the development of reliable 
computational methods for identifying protein-protein interaction residues. 
Many cellular events involve the formation of protein–protein complexes. 
Elucidation of the structural details of these complexes will undoubtedly contribute to 
our understanding of their functional properties, and thus is a major goal of structural 
biology. However, only a small fraction of experimentally determined structures are of 
protein–protein complexes. Therefore, it is of substantial interest to develop 
computational docking methods that, given the structures of the individual component 
proteins, are able to assemble them into the complex in an accurate and reliable way. 
Today, new genomes are constantly increasing. It is only possible to assign 
function to 40% of all protein sequences based on sequence similarity. There is a great 
need for protein function prediction methods. If a protein sequence is not similar to 
any other known protein, it is reasonable to expect that proteins with related function 
will have similar properties. 
 
2. Research purpose 
The main purpose of this research is to predict the interactions and functions of 
proteins. A HMM model which is related to 1D sequence and secondary states is built 
to predict protein interaction and protein function. The result of this research can be 
used to extend gene network databases. These databases can be further applied for 
medical diagnosis, drug discovery and biological researches. 
  
3. Previous Efforts 
Based on different characteristics of known protein-protein interaction sites, 
several methods have been proposed for predicting interface residues using a

the files are about protein primary structures and second structures. And we download 
protein interaction dataset from Yan’s website (http:// www.cs.iastate.edu /~yan330 
/p-p /p- p.htm ). We create a database to store these data records. 
 
Figure 1. HMM Model of Our Approach. 
  We train our statistic model in Figure1 using the database. After training, we also 
test the statistic model. The statistic model achieved 71% accuracy (complicated 
model) and 80% accuracy (easy model). The statistic model can predict which 
residues participate in protein-protein interaction when you input a protein sequence. 
  The second step is about docking. After predicting protein interaction site, 
interactions between proteins become critical in biology. With the advent of genome 
and proteome projects, there is much interest in predicting the structures of 
protein-protein complexes. We use genetic algorithm to modify FTDock. Then we 
displace MultiDock by our statistic model and cooperate RPDock to be fitness 
function [26].  
The Gene Ontology (GO) Annotation project at European Bioinformatics 
Institute has mapped identifiers of Protein Data Bank (PDB) into GO terms. Three 
organizing principles of GO are cellular component, biological process and molecular 
function. Table 1 collects 6362 proteins from Protein Data Bank. These proteins are

same way. Every division of test sets is input our interaction model and 
non-interaction model. All kind of logistic probability (all route and amino acid in a 
block) that test sets match are summed. So we have input interaction test sets in our 
interaction model and non-interaction model. The statistic model achieved 71% 
accuracy (complicated model) and 80% accuracy (easy model). 
We have developed a method to predict protein function. Our algorithm, a 
Hidden Markov Model, has been built to solve our problem with statistical concept. At 
present, many researchers are devoted to the study of this field. But several methods 
are too complex because many factors of the protein are considered. We utilize 
advantage of the computer to deal with a large amount of biological data quickly. The 
mathematical model is trained to get the probability. We can use our method to predict 
protein function after training. The relation between the protein function and its 
molecular structure is close, so the secondary structure is considered in our method. 
Finally, the average accuracy of our method is 62.97%. In the future, this method can 
be applied to the prediction of other functions of biochemistry such as Enzyme and 
Non-enzyme.

1 Introduction 
 
New genomes are increasing rapidly. When 
analyzing the protein coding genes, it is typically 
only possible to assign function to 40% of all protein 
sequences based on sequence similarity [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
There is a great need for protein function prediction 
methods. There are a number of methods to predict 
protein function, such as: 1. Pairwise sequence 
similarity methods [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. 2. Iterative search 
methods among multiple sequences [10, 11]. 3. 
Super family database methods [12, 13]. 4. 
Alignment based methods using functional links [14, 
15]. 5. Predicting protein function via structure 
[16,17,18]. 6. Neural network using protein 
features.[19] 
The Gene Ontology project [20] provides a 
controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene 
product in any organism. The GO consortium has 
grown to include many databases, including several 
of the world’s major repositories for plant, animal 
and microbial genomes. The three organizing 
principles of Gene Ontology are cellular component, 
biological process and molecular function. A gene 
product might be associated with or located in one or 
more cellular components; it is active in one or more 
biological processes, during which it performs one or 
more molecular functions. 
If a protein sequence is not similar to any other 
known protein, it is reasonable to expect that proteins 
with related function will have similar properties, 
even if they are not evolutionarily related. In this 
paper, a HMM predictor have been trained for a 
subset (cellular component) of Gene Ontology 
classes. Similar technique can be applied for 
biological process and molecular function of GO 
classes. Since protein function is closely related to 
both protein sequence and structure. To record a 
large amount of protein properties, the input data for 
this HMM model are amino acid sequences aligning 
with the corresponding secondary structure 
sequences. This mathematical approach is practical 
and easy to compute. The accuracy of this method 
can reach to 62.97%. 
In [19], Jenson had developed 17 protein 
features from sequence or secondary structure. Many 
physical, chemical or biological characteristics are 
involved to compute these features. Then neural 
network is trained to recognize specific property of 
these features. Our HMM statistic model is relatively 
simple to predict function. This model has 
considered the alignment corresponding relationships 
between sequence and secondary structure. For 
orphan protein which has similar property and 
dissimilar sequence, the propagation possibilities of 
HMM can recognize such property and provide 
better prediction.

Step2: calculate the probability of every parameter 
We have to know the probability of each 
parameter. Utilizing the data counted, we can get 
the expected value of each parameter. In helix, 
sheet or coil, the total sum of probabilities of 20 
amino acids equals 1. The probability of amino 
acid G is the frequency of amino acid G divided 
by total frequency of 20 amino acids, as: 
 
It is noted that the starting and ending protein 
sequences are usually corresponding to coil at 
most of time.  
 
Step3: The calculated probability translates into 
log value, and the base of logarithm is e (= 
2.71828). There is every parameter’s log value 
about this example. Because we can not take log 
of 0, represent it by ∮. 
 
4 Predicting Method 
 
 We got the protein data from protein data bank 
and had said we focus on the cellular component. 
It has eight categories at present, but we only fetch 
six categories. After running our training model, 
we can get envelope model by training set of 
envelope category. Extracellular matrix, 
extracellular region, organelle, protein complex 
and virion are the same. After training, we can 
begin to test. See the figure 3-7. 
The predicting method is to input an unknown 
protein into the model, and we multiply every 
parameter of passing through. Then we can finally 
get the expected value. But the last value may be 
very difficult to calculate because the value is too 
small, like 3.95E-70. It is all the multiplication of 
decimals, so the result is too small to show and the 
performance is not very good on procedure 
execution. Because of this shortcoming, we utilize 
logarithmic function. Not only the result shows 
easily, the procedure is relatively high efficiency 
on addition operation. We assume there are two 
sequences, protein sequence and its 2D structure 
sequence, and the length of them is m. The 
sequence imports to our training model and 
calculate the expected value. The array “aa” 
denotes this protein sequence. P(aa) denotes its 
expected value, but it’s probably in helix, sheet or 
coil. The array “A” denotes a series of the 
transition of state. It represents probability when 
the state is changed.

There is a formula about logarithmic function. 
 
Assume the base of logarithm is e and rewrite the

Then we get a simple prediction utilizing above 
training data. Given an unknown protein sequence
