1摘要
由於網際網路技術的快速進步，以及廣佈在每一地方公用資訊站數量的增
加，使得人們可以很容易地存取個人敏感資料或是透過這些公用終端機進行交
易。在 2000 年 11 月間台灣曾經發生過犯罪集團利用收購報廢提款機供不知情的
民眾使用，盜取其金融卡密碼，再複製成偽卡盜領。我們認為若有辦法能讓使用
者辨識 ATM 之真偽，將可遏止此類犯罪行為，而廣佈各種公共場所的公用終端
機(Kiosk)同樣有這類的安全問題！認證這些公用終端機因此成為最破迫切的主
題。
本計畫中，我們著眼於提出一種在交易前進行認證公用終端機的模式，使得
網路使用者能夠有效率且安全地做線上交易，這樣的設計方式將使得網路上的交
易活動安全性能夠確保，使用者進行存取個人敏感性資料時不會發生資料外洩的
情形。
就這個議題而言， Asokan 等人曾在 1999 年針對使用者配備個人化的信賴
設備提出不同的解決方法，緊接著 Cheng 等人以公開金鑰演算法的觀念提出另
一種解決方法，無論如何目前這些方法中都存在著許多的互動步驟，以及所提的
架構未必符合現實環境，導致無法提供一個完美的解決方式。
在本計畫中，我們將先對個人敏感資料外洩原因及入侵系統的環境作相關資
料的收集與研究，再結合過去我們許多發展 Web base 應用系統的經驗，定義更
明確的 Kiosk 應用環境，進而提出一個既有效率又安全的驗證模式，使得系統的
計算量以及互動步驟能夠達到最經濟之境。其次，我們利用這樣一個已被驗證過
的終端機把它當成投票亭，提出一種在 Kiosk 上植基於離散對數問題的電子投票
系統。

31. Introduction
The first electronic election scheme was proposed by David Chaum [1].
Anonymous voting involves making sure that voters can vote of their own free will.
The voting system must guarantee that voters remain anonymous during the entire
voting process. A good electronic voting system should be at minimum as secure as
traditional voting systems. The most important privacy issue is making sure that the
voting process is untraceable; a ballot cannot be traced to an individual. In 1981,
David Chaum [1] proposed a solution that employed a series of honest “mixers” on 
the network. Any mixer could be chosen by the voter as a transmitter to send the
ballot and cut off the network address on the way. As to cut the link between the
voters and the balots, the theorem of “blind signature” is used in many proposals [2-9]
to solve such a problem.
Implementing a secure anonymous channel is not a problem on the current
Internet. Suppose we want to construct a voting system on the Internet, this means
that all of the voting centers should be set up as web sites. We know that any web site
can make a secure communication channel under the “Secure Socket Layer (SSL)” 
infrastructure. We propose applying the SSL for secure communications between the
voters and the voting centers. Moreover, for cutting off the network address as a voter
casts his balot, we introduce the existing “public proxy server” to play the role of 
“mixer”. The network address for the balot can then be replaced by a proxy server
address.
2. Research Propose
Based on the secure authenticated public terminals, we afterwards shall propose
an E-voting protocol for real application. In this project, we propose a practical and
secure anonymous Internet voding protocol. This method integrates Internet realiti
and cryptology. Issues such as the kinds of “certificate authority” and “public proxy 
server” are integrated in oup scheme to solve the Internet identification and 
anonymity problems. To combine and make up a series of ElGamal blind signature
and secret sharing cryptosystem, this protocol can be applied to a secure, practical,
and fair voting system.
3. Related work
As to cut the link between the voters and the ballots, we also introduce how the
signature for valid ballots can be signed blindly using the ElGamal blind signature
[10,11,12] scheme where a malicious voter cannot cheat the system and a malicious
center cannot determine how any individual voted.
According to the other important verifiability issue, many proposals [1,13-18]
emphasized that their schemes allow the voters to verify the voting result. When a
5Supervision Center (SC): A web site that is responsible for supervising the
tallying task.
Figure 1. The structure of our scheme
1. Voter→CA: Before the election, all of voters should be enrolled in a register of
electors.
2. CA→Voter: After the voter completes the enrollment, the CA signs and issues
a“personal certificate”to the voter.
3. Voter→AC: Only voters that have a verified legal“personal certificate”
embedded into their web browser can login to the AC web site.
4. AC→Voter: The AC issues the corresponding“voter-pseudonym signature”to
the voter for the next voting phase.
5. Voter→TC, SC: The voter casts his “voter-pseudonym signature” and 
“encrypted secret-sharing balot” through a trusted public 
proxy server to the TC and SC, respectively, without
forwarding any information about the location from where
the voter voted.
6. TC  SC: Under TC and SC cooperation, each “encrypted secret-sharing
balot” can be decrypted and counted for the voting result.
The detail scenario is described as related publication. This method integrates
Internet reality and cryptology. The issues, such as the kinds of “certificate authority” 
and “public proxy server”, are integrated into our scheme to solve the Internet
identification and anonymous problems. Based on the Elgamal blind signature scheme
and the secret sharing cryptosystem, this protocol can be implemented to a fair and
practical election.
7(3) Anonymity in the Announcement phase
As we mentioned before, other systems allow the voters to verify the voting result.
This will encourage bribery because bribers will also be able to verify bribed votes.
We advocate that a supervision center comprised of members from all of the political
parties must control and verify the voting process. Only with the cooperation of TC
and SC, each vote can be decrypted. A secure supervision facility wil win the voter’s 
trust. It is not necessary to allow voters verify (or show to bribers) their votes in the
announcement phase. There is no anonymity problem in the announcement phase in
our scheme.
5.3 Accuracy Issues
All valid votes must be counted correctly. A vote cannot be altered, duplicated, or
removed in our scheme because the secret sharing mechanism is applied to each vote.
The secret marked ballot is then hidden and transmitted to the TC and SC. Only with the
cooperation of the TC and SC using their secret keys can a ballot be revealed.
Every ballot will be revealed in this way and announced. This design guarantees
that ballot counting is under the supervision of the SC and TC. A ballot miscount
cannot occur in our scheme. There is another point is worth noting. Some schemes
[13,16,17,19] do not ensure that the election is fair, i.e., the voting center knows the
intermediate result from the voting. The voting center can therefore affect the election
by leaking the intermediate result to the public. Those schemes that allow voters to
recast their votes before the election deadline create a very serious problem. In our
scheme, no one can get any information about the tally result before the voting
deadline.
5.4 Verifiability Issues
According to the verifiability issue, let voters can make sure that their votes are
counted correctly; we advocate that voters should not be allowed to verify their votes
by themselves. Since some candidates may enforce voters to change their intentions
by money or threat. And the bribers will be easy to verify the bribed vote as voters can
verify their votes. Therefore, we involve the secret sharing mechanism in our scheme
to be sure all of the votes can be counted correctly. The tally center cannot falsify a
false tally since all votes are counted under the supervision of the supervision center.
Such a kind of concept should be the general definition of verifiability.
5.5 Mobility Issues
Our scheme involves setting up those web sites, applying the existing certificate
authority and public proxy servers and secure and anonymous voting. The voting

計畫成果自評
On the basis of the first year researches, we continued to design the E-voting
protocol under the authenticated kiosk. We have proposed a secure anonymous
e-voting scheme that uses a modified ElGamal digital signature algorithm. The project
has surveyed some papers about the topics on E-voting and the authentication kiosk.
Our scheme not only solves the fairness, privacy, accuracy and verifiability problems,
but also uses current network technology to implement a practical e-voting system.
The time complexity for the required processing is acceptable. This design is suitable
for implementation on the Internet.
Our e-voting system is not difficult to be implemented. The students can learn

Abstract
This paper presents two concise novel
steganographic schemes of strings comparing and
formats converting based on the Row-Major Mapping
Relation (RMMR). In general, the number of concealed
secret bits( m) is far smaller than that of available host
bits(n). Based on the property, we proved that if
n 2≧ m-1, the alteration rates of our proposed schemes
are independent of n, and the alteration rates are close
to m-1 when m is large. Even in the worst case that the
amount of the secret bits is equal to that of the host bits
and over half of the host bits are altered, our proposed
scheme based on the Row-Major Mapping Relation
with complement (RMMRwC) can decrease the
alteration rate. From practical analyses and
theoretical inductions, all results show that our novel
schemes have advantages over steganography.
1. Introduction
The word steganography means “covered writing” 
and extendedly indicates all methods of secret
communications to conceal the message [1, 2]. The
relative study of this field could be traced back to
Simmons, who modeled it as “the Prisoners’ Problem” 
in 1983 [3]. Assume that Alice and Bob are in jail.
When they conspire to make an escape plan, a key
point is their communications must pass through the
warden. For avoid revealing the secret, in addition to
cryptography, steganography can provide some
common methods to imperceptibly conceal data into
some medium and conveniently extract data [4, 5].
Besides the properties of imperceptibility, robustness,
and security, the capacity of steganography is also an
important factor [6, 7].
To achieve no distortion against steganalytic
techniques, we should focus on decreasing alteration
rate. Furthermore, the number of concealed secret bits
is far smaller than that of available host bits. Therefore,
bits of LSB plane are slightly replaced with the secret
bits which would lead less distortion [8].
In this paper, we present two novel steganographic
schemes based on the Row-Major Mapping Relation
(RMMR). One without using the complement operation
on the secret string is denoted as RMMRw/oC. The
other applies the complement operation on the secret
string is called RMMRwC.
In general, the number of concealed secret bits is far
smaller than that of available host bits. Based on the
property, we proved that if n 2≧ m-1, where n is the
amount of the host bits and m is the amount of the
secret bits, the alteration rates of our proposed schemes
are independent of n, and the alteration rates are close
to m-1 when m is large.
2. Notations and definitions
In this section, we present the notations for
variables and the definitions of functions which will be
used in our proposed steganographic schemes.
Definition 1: Let 11 bbbS nn  be an n-bit string
with }1,0{ib for all i = 1, 2, … , n. The function
)(_ SIconvert is the decimal representation of string S .
That is, 

For example, let 01100S , )(_ SIconvert
122*02*02*12*12*0 01234  .
5(3) The secret string is 01001)5,9(_cov Serre .
The amount of bit ‘1’ in 'S is only 1. Therefore,
no complement will need to be used in the RMMRwC
scheme.
Example 2: Assume the sender holds a secret string
S=11011 and a host string H=10010. The encoding
phase of RMMRw/oC Scheme is as follows:
(1) 27)11011(_  Iconvertd .
(2) 10111)5,27(_'  SRMS .
(3) .0010110111),10010(),( ' DSHD
(4) Finally, transmit 00101 and 5 to the receiver.
For the decoding phase, the receiver computes
(1) 10111)00101,10010(' DS .
(2) 27)10111(_  IRMd .
(3) The secret string is 11011)5,27(_cov Serre .
With RMMRwC Scheme, the sender implements the
following encoding phase.
(1) 27)11011(_  Iconvertd .
(2) 10111)5,27(_'  SRMS .
(3) .10101)'1'10111,,10010(),,( ' DpSHD
(4) transmit 11010, 5, and ‘1’to the receiver.
For the decoding phase, the receiver computes
(1) 10111)'1',11010,10010(' DS .
(2) 27)10111(_  IRMd .
(3) The secret string is 11011)5,27(_cov Serre .
Clearly, the number of alteration bits of RMMRwC
Scheme is only one which is less than that of
RMMRw/oC scheme.
4. Analyses and Discussione
The alteration bits of a steganographic scheme can
be regarded as a discrete random variable X with
possible values 0, 1,…, n. Clearly, the probability
)( iXp  is the ratio of the number of secret strings
with alteration bits i over the number of all secret
strings. The expected number of the alteration bits

Especially, let 1A denote the alteration rate of
Scheme RMMRw/oC and 2A denote the alteration rate

respect to RMMRwC is defined as

For example, consider the case when the number of
host string n= 3 and the number of secret string m=2. In
Table 1, the A1 of RMMRw/oC
A1=(0*1/4+1*3/4)/2=3/8=0.375.

A2= (0*1/8+1*3/8+1*3/8+0*1/8)/3=6/24= 0.25.
Therefore, R=(0.5-0.25)/0.5*100%=50%.
