Abstract 
This research is the first subproject of the project named “Research on the Integrated 
Algorithm of Target Tracking, Identification and Management for Command and Control 
System with Distributed Network Structure”. Radar tracking suffers from clutters in the form 
of unwanted, unavoidable and unpredictable signal echos from sea, land, and weather. 
Maneuvering target tracking is an important issue for radar designers in this situation. The 
Hough transform is a well known technique for identifying a srtraight line in noisy 
environments. This techuique can be utilized to design a clutter elimination algorithm for 
clutters censoring if an accurate target trajectory estimation method is adopted. This study 
presents a novel tracking algorithm by integrating the Kalman filter, input estimation, and 
clutter elimination algorithm to track maneuvering targets in cluttered environments. To 
ensure the target to be tracked continuously, the estimation errors between the predicted and 
real trajectories should be within a range cell. Simulation results reveal that the proposed 
algorithm can provide an acceptable accuracy to maintain track. Although clutters can not be 
totally censored, the effects of resting clutters can be reduced to an acceptable range. The 
proposed algorithm thus may help radars in achieving continuous tracking. In conclusion, 
this algorithm deserves further study and application.   
Keywords: Input estimation, Hough transform, Tracking algorithm, clutter.

1. Introduction 
Clutter describes unwanted signal echo from sea, land,  cloud, or weather. Clutter is 
unavoidable and unpredictable in radar tracking, and cause radar to randomly receive 
numerous echos in one scan. Radar should act to eliminate false alarms or discriminate the 
real target from clutters to continue tracking target. Numerous researchers have endeavored 
to study clutter suppression by applying Doppler shift, moving target indicator, etc., which 
have been addressed in hardware design [1]. However, though effective these methods are 
highly costly. Phased array radar has been interesting focus of design efforts during past two 
decades. Certain signal processing functions implemented by hardware are accomplished via 
algorithm in digital computers. Algorithm development then became the main task in 
achieving desired tracking performance in cluttered environments. Tracking problems 
generally involve initialization, maintenance, and deletion. The Hough transform (HT) was 
designed to identify straight lines in noisy environments [2] and was introduced to improve 
target detection and acquisition [3, 4]. The HT was modified and associated with directional 
probability data association (DPDA) for initialization and maintenance in air traffic control 
[5]. Track maintenance is the key issue for target tracking like air traffic control and is the 
main concern of this study. Thus, this transform is utilzed to discriminate target from clutters 
because the target flies along a straight line nearly at a short time. An effective algorithm, 
associating the HT with a target trajectory estimation method which focuses on the 
maneuvering target, is required. 
Reentry vehicle (RV) is hard to be tracked using a single radar only because of its high 
speed and high elevation angle. It is necessary to estimate and predict RV trajectory on-line 
when utlizing a precision phased array radar for multiple targets tracking. The main 
problems with the on-line estimation of RV trajectory relate to model validation, owing to 
model error between the mathematical model and the physical system. Model error generally 
results from simplifying assumptions, maneuvering and unpredictable external forces during 
flight or from parameter uncertainty. Input estimation (IE) with the extended Kalman filter 
(EKF) effectively solves model validation problem. IE has been successfully employed to 
estimate inputs for solving tracking [6, 7, 8, 9],  inverse heat conduction [10, 11, 12], and 
initial leveling problems [13, 14]. Lee and Liu developed a filter associating the EKF with IE 
to handle model validation problems, and presented an accurate trajectory estimation method

A phased array radar with high resolution and precision is used in tracking, and is the 
only instrument in the system for detecting the target. Assume the bias of the radar to be 
corrected before detection. The detected elevation, azimuth, and range are transferred into 
position. The velocity obtained by a specific filter in radar is taken as the measurements to 
improve estimation accuracy. For simplicity and being easily implemented, the effects of 
nonlinearity induced by filtering are ignored. The linear measurement equation for the target 
at the n-th the sampling period, is given by [15]

with mean zero and variance R. Equations (2) and (3) are the dynamic equations for the 
target. One should estimate X based on the measurement Z.

and )1( lklk +++P  expresses the covariance matrix of the predicted states for the KF with 
no input. 
In Eq. (8), k and s respectively denote the starting and stopping indices of the system 
input. As mentioned earlier, the system input onset is unpredictable and can not be assumed 
in advance. An on-line testing method is introduced to determine k and s during estimation. 
Two hypotheses, exitence and absence of inputs, are set. Each normalized estimated input at 
time k+l-1 locates outside the confidence interval [-tst, tst] if the first hypotheis is satisfied. 
Otherwise, the input is absent. The confidence interval can be obtained from the cumulative 
normal distribution table for a certain preset confidence level 1-α [15].  
Once the input is estimated, the KF is corrected with the estimated input at the same 
time. By incorporating the on-line input estimator into the KF, the predicted and updated 
states at time interval k t t k s t∆ ∆≤ ≤ +( )  are given by

N+1 sets of measureemnts, Eqs. (3) and (19), are gathered via a radar beam. Clearly, if 
)(nciZ  is chosen and substituted into Eq. (5), the radar loosens the target and tracks clutter. 
This phenomenon is a serious problem should be solved to ensure track maintenance.  
The Hough transform (HT) was developed to identify straight lines in a noisy 
environment. Consider a point ),( yx  in a Cartesian frame and it can be transformed into the 
ρ-θ plane by following [2] 
θθρ sincos yx +=                   πθ ≤≤0                  (20) 
Various points in a Cartesian frame generate a family of curves in the ρ-θ plane. If n points, 
),( 11 yx , ),( 22 yx , …, ),( nn yx , lie on a straight line, their transform have a common point. 
Consider the measured target quantities, ( )1( +nqx , )1( +nqy , )1( +nqz ), and the i-th 
clutter, ( )1( +nqcxi , )1( +nqcyi , )1( +nqczwi ), at tnt ∆+= )1(  to be taken into account. The 
relationship between two quantities of the target and i-th clutter in X R  can be described as

where )1( +∆ nqcxi  denotes the deviation from the target trajectory governed by clutter which 
is assumed to be uniformly dsitributed [3]. The definitions of )1( +∆ nqcyi  and )1( +∆ nqczi  in 
YR  and ZR  are the same. The angle of slope of the straight line connecting the estimated and

by choosing one jθ  that causes corresponding jρ ’s of Eqs. (23)∼(26) to be the nearest. The

The real target trajectory is generated from Eq. (2) along with four pieces of clutter, which 
are uniformly distributed within the same radar beam. Four pieces of clutter are generated 
within a range cell centered on the simulated RV and with radius 
  )sin()( bwtb tRr θ=                                                             (33) 
where )(tRt denotes the range of the target at time t and bwθ  means beamwidth of the radar 
beam. That is the radar receives five sets of measurements, echos from target and four pieces 
of clutter, in one scan. 
Consider the tracked target flies over the radar detection region with initial positions 
of kmx 05)0( = , kmy 53)0( = , mz 300)0( = , and with constant velocities of 
sec/006 mvx −= , sec/005 mvy −= , sec/0mvz = . For an existent phased array radar using 
in detecting target, its sampling period and beamwidth are ∆t=0.25seconds and θbw=1.2°.

confidence level 1-α to be 95% that is the confidence interval [-tst, tst]=[-1.96, 1.96]. The 
values of R and Q were taken I6×6 both and the initial conditions of V(0) and )00(vP  were 
500I6×6 both. The first measurement, Z(0) is taken as the initial state vector, )00(ˆ vX . Clutter 
elimination algorithm is activated after receiving the third measurement. Two scenarios are 
taken into account to see how the proposed algorithm performs if target trajectory is not a 
straight line. Cases considered in this section are with NMC =50 Monte Carlo runs.

-rb). This result ensures that the target remains continuously located in the radar beam. It also 
provides a good velocity estimation results whose errors are restricted within (20m/sec, -
30m/sec) and approach to 0 gradually. Method II offers a larger position error in the area 
800m ∼ -1000m that is located outside (rb, -rb) that implies the target not being tracked any 
more. Its velocity estimation errors locate within (300m/sec, -200m/sec) that are larger than 
of the proposed method. Position estimation errors induced by Method III also fluctuate 
between 200m and -400m that are still larger than Method I. Velocity estimation error 
generated by Method III is the largest one among three methods. Clutter significantly 
influences the estimation result when utlizing Methods II and III.  
6.  Conclusions 
This study presents an accurate filter for target tracking in a cluttered environment. 
The proposed method comprises a Kalman filter, an input estimator and a clutter elimination 
algorithm based on the Hough transform. The Kalman filter associated with input estimation 
handles the model error problem and can accurately estimate trajectory. The clutter 
elimination algorithm combines with the precise estimated trajectory to establish an 
algorithm for selecting one among numerous sets of measurements including target and 
clutter. The loop involving estimation and elimination can effectively track maintenance for 
the target. The simulation results monitor the method performance by inspecting the 
estimation error which has to keep in certain bounds to ensure good target tracking. 
Although clutter is not completely censored, the proposed filter almost completely vanishes 
its effects. This investigation thus concludes that the proposed algorithm deserves further 
study and applications.
