研究目的  
在本研究中，我們計畫研究的是MM*模式的準確(t, k)偵錯度。我們考慮求出格子圖(grid)
在MM*模式下準確偵錯策略之(t, k)偵錯的偵錯度。並期望可以推廣至格子圖的變形系統
(如：圓環面tori)的偵錯度問題。 
MM*模式是目前最常見的系統偵錯模式之一[1][2]。MM* 模式假設任一個處理機(測
試者)可同時送測試資料給二個與它相連的處理機(受測者)。這二個受測者分別將測試資料
執行約定的計算並將結果傳回測試者。最後測試者比較二個受測者回傳的結果宣布測試結
果為：受測者皆無誤或是至少一個有誤。若二個受測者回傳的結果相同，則二個受測者皆
為無誤，否則至少有一個受測者是有誤的。同時，MM*模式假設: 無誤的測試者才能保證
測試結果的正確性。若測試者有誤，即使二個受測者皆無誤，測試者仍可能宣布測試結果
為至少一個受測者有誤。 
為了因應各種不同應用的需求，亦有不同的偵錯策略。目前被廣泛地研究與討論的是
循序偵錯(sequential diagnosis)[3]和(t, k)偵錯((t, k)-diagnosis)[4]。循序偵錯要求根據症狀，診
斷出一個以上有誤的處理機。被診斷為有誤的處理機會進行修復或替換，接著再進行下一
次的全面測試得到新的症狀、然後診斷出有誤處理機，重覆此過程直到所有有誤的處理機
都被診斷出來。(t, k)偵錯推廣了循序偵錯。它要求根據症狀，診斷出至少k 個有誤的處理
機或全部有誤的處理機(當系統中有誤的處理機數量小於k 時)。近來循序偵錯和(t, k)偵錯越
來越受重視，因為它適用於大型的處理機系統。而循序偵錯是(t, k)偵錯的特例，所以我們
考慮更複雜的(t, k)偵錯的偵錯度問題。 
文獻探討 
系統偵錯方面的研究有三個主要的議題 : 偵錯度 (diagnosability)、偵錯演算法
diagnosis)、和特性描述(characterization)。其中偵錯度目前主要的研究方向之一。偵錯度是
指系統容許有誤處理機的最大數量。一旦系統中有誤處理機的數量超過偵錯度，則系統便
無法進行偵錯。決定偵錯度方面的研究結果彙整如下: 
許多常見系統之一步偵錯度問題已得到解決。而我們在IEEE Transactions on Parallel 
and Distributed Systems 2005[5]的論文中，根據大多數常見系統具有拓樸性質，推導出在不
同的偵錯模式與偵錯策略下一步偵錯度的結果，不僅包含了大多數已知的系統，同時也包
含了許多未知的系統。至於循序與(t, k )偵錯度問題由於困難度相當高，因此這方面的研究
的研究成果仍然很少。而且大部分的結果是關於另一個常用的偵錯模式PMC模式[3]。例如： 
d維的對稱格子圖的循序偵錯度是Ω(Nd/(d+1))[6], 其中N為多處理機個數；超立方體的循序偵
錯度是Ω(N*log2log2 N/log2 N)；cube-connected cycles 的循序偵錯度是Ω(N1/2)；k-ary trees的
循序偵錯度是Ω((N/k)1/2)相稱構成網路 (matching composition networks)[10]之PMC-準確循

同狀態集之間的關係可能與無誤聚集及無誤狀態集之間的關係相似。由於有誤頂點測試其
他頂點的測試結果無法保證其正確性，因此，在有誤聚集中的多頂點聚集與單頂點聚集之
間的關係也有可能滿足觀察一、觀察二和觀察三。根據以上的觀察與討論，我們擬定了以
下三個主要的研究步驟： 
步驟一、分析無誤同狀態集與大的無誤聚集的關係，和有誤同狀態集與大的有誤聚集
的關係，以求出可識別的無誤狀態集的特性。根據以往的研究經驗，若系統中存在一個很
大的無誤聚集，可能比較容易識別。事實上，在MM*模式下，即使系統中存在一個比系統
有誤頂點總數還要大的無誤聚集，我們仍無法識別它。因為一個很大的無誤聚集可能由許
多無誤的單頂點同狀態集和一個無誤的多頂點同狀態集組成。因此，我們必須更進一步分
析同狀態集、聚集的關係。 
定理五. 當一個多頂點同狀態集Y與其他相鄰的單頂點同狀態集X有如下的關係，任二
個頂點y屬於Y, x屬於X，若y測試x的結果為無誤，而x測試y為有誤，則Y和所有這樣的X的聯
集可能為一個無誤的聚集。 
步驟二、研究有誤頂點總數與可識別無誤聚集的關係此步驟中，我們想要研究系統中
有誤頂點總數達多少時，才會存在一個很大而且可以識別的無誤聚集。直覺上，當有誤頂
點數目比較少時，系統中比較容易有大的無誤聚集。我們首先想要探討系統中有誤頂點數
目與最大無誤聚集所包含頂點數之間的關係。然後，再進一步研究系統中有誤頂點數目與
可識別的無誤聚集的大小之間的關係。若我們可以求出此結果，則我們得到一個t 的下限
值。然而這是一個相當難的問題，我們目前研究的是格子圖，所得到的結果是t 至少等於
系統頂點數目的0.5 次方。 
定理六. 所有符合定理五的集合，若其處理機個數大於 t*
2−
∆
δ ，則此集合必為一無誤
聚集。 
步驟三、研究每步可偵測之有誤頂點數與可識別無誤聚集大小的關係我們想要證明當
系統存在這樣一個大的無誤聚集時，每個偵錯的步驟(iteration)中至少可找出幾個有誤的頂
點。也就是在每一次完整測試之後，根據症狀，可以找出多少有誤的頂點。由於，每一次
找出的有誤頂點都會被修復或替代成無誤的頂點，所以，除了第一個步驟之外，每一個步
驟都可以根據這些無誤的頂點找出一個無誤的聚集。然後再根據這個無誤的聚集找出有誤
頂點。直覺上，最小的無誤聚集的鄰居頂點數應該與k 有關。然而要知道最小的聚集鄰居
頂點數等同於要計算該系統的連結度(connectivity)。所謂連結度是指系統中存在一個頂點子
集使得移除該頂點子集之後，系統剩下的頂點中便有不相連(disconnected)的頂點。我們試
著去證明 k 至少等於系統的連結度。我們也試著證明k 是否可能大於系統的連結度。 
結果六. k不可能大於系統連結度 
根據以上的定理與結果我們得到以下的結果。 
定理七. d維的格子圖的MM*模式準確(t,k)偵錯度為(Ω(Nd/(d+1)), Ω(d))。 
此外，我們還推導出圓環面的結果如下：  
定理八. d維的圓環面的MM*模式準確(t,k)偵錯度為(Ω(Nd/(d+1)), Ω(d))。

(t, k)-DIAGNOSABILITY OF MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEMS WITH
APPLICATIONS TO GRIDS AND TORI∗
GUEY-YUN CHANG† AND GEN-HUEY CHEN‡
Abstract. (t, k)-diagnosis, which is a generalization of sequential diagnosis, requires at least
k faulty processors identiﬁed and replaced (or repaired) in each iteration provided there are at
most t faulty processors, where t ≥ k. This paper suggests lower bounds on the degrees of (t, k)-
diagnosability of multiprocessor systems under both the PMC and the MM* models. As a conse-
quence, grids and tori of d dimensions are shown to be (Ω(N
d
d+1 ), Ω(d))-diagnosable and (Ω(N
d
d+1 ),
Ω(2d))-diagnosable, respectively, where N is the number of processors.

1. Introduction. System-level diagnosis, which was introduced by Preparta,
Metze, and Chien [27], aims to identify faulty processors in a multiprocessor system
by analyzing the outcomes of available interprocessor tests. The problem has been
extensively studied in the literature [3], [10], [14], [17], [27]. The PMC (Preparta–
Metze–Chien) model, which was originally introduced in [27], is possibly the most
well-studied model for system-level diagnosis. It assumes that each processor can test
its neighboring processors and declare them fault-free or faulty. The test results are
considered reliable if the processor is fault-free. Previous work on the PMC model
can be found in [15], [18], [19], [20], [21], [28], [30].
In [29], Sengupta and Dahbura proposed another diagnosis model, called the MM*
model, under which each processor has to test any two of its neighboring processors.
The testing processor feeds the two tested processors with the same task and input
and then compares their outputs. It is assumed that the outputs are identical if they
are fault-free, and distinct otherwise. Only a fault-free testing processor can guarantee
a reliable test result. The MM* model was also studied in [2], [16], [24], [31].
There are three fundamental diagnosis strategies, i.e., one-step diagnosis, sequen-
tial diagnosis, and (t, k)-diagnosis, for system-level diagnosis. In one-step diagnosis,
all faulty processors are identiﬁed before replacement (or repair) is made. In sequential
diagnosis and (t, k)-diagnosis, faulty processors are identiﬁed and replaced iteratively.
Diﬀerently, in each iteration, at least one faulty processor is identiﬁed and replacd in
sequential diagnosis, whereas at least k faulty processors (or all faulty processors if
fewer than k faulty processors remain) are identiﬁed and replaced in (t, k)-diagnosis
provided there are at most t faulty processors, where t ≥ k. Notice that one-step
diagnosis (when t = k) and sequential diagnosis (when k = 1) are two instances of
(t, k)-diagnosis.

and 2, the invalidation rules of the PMC and MM* models are summarized in Tables 1
and 2, respectively.
Definition 3. A system S with a fault set F is (t, k)-diagnosable if, given any
syndrome σ for S, at least k faulty processors can be identiﬁed when k < |F | ≤ t and
all faulty processors can be identiﬁed when |F | ≤ k.
The vertex set, denoted by Λ, of a strongly connected subgraph of G is called an
aggregate if either all the vertices of Λ are fault-free and all the vertices of N(Λ) are
faulty or all the vertices of Λ are faulty and all the vertices of N(Λ) are fault-free [10].
The indegree (outdegree) of a vertex u in G is the number of arcs entering (leaving)
u. Since each vertex of G has indegree equal to outdegree, we simply use degree to
denote either of them when there is no ambiguity. In the rest of this paper, we use Δ
and δ to denote the maximal degree and minimal degree of G, respectively.
2.1. The PMC model. Let ΥP (x) be the set of neighboring vertices of x
that are tested by x as fault-free under the PMC model, i.e., ΥP (x) = {y : y ∈
N(x) and σ(x, y) = 0}. Suppose that (u1, u2, . . . , um) is a directed path from vertex
u1 to vertex um in G. If ui+1 ∈ ΥP (ui) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m− 1, then either u1 is faulty
or u1, u2, . . . , um are all fault-free. By G
†
P we denote the spanning subgraph of G
whose arcs are all (u, v)’s with v ∈ ΥP (u), i.e., G†P = (V †P , A†P ), where V †P = V and
A†P = {(u, v) : (u, v) ∈ A and v ∈ ΥP (u)}. In the rest of this paper, each strongly
connected subgraph of G†P is referred to as a P-component. That is, if u and v are
two distinct vertices belonging to the same P-component, there are two directed paths
from u to v and from v to u in G†P , respectively. Furthermore, for ease of subsequent
discussion, we let each P-component denote only the vertex set of the representing
subgraph.
Clearly, each P-component has all vertices fault-free or all vertices faulty. More-
over, each fault-free P-component is also a fault-free aggregate in G. For example, let
G be a 4× 4 grid, as depicted in Figure 1(a), where white (black) vertices are fault-
free (faulty). There are four aggregates in G, two fault-free and two faulty, as shown
in Figure 1(b). Assume that σ(u, v) = 0 if u and v are fault-free, and σ(u, v) = 1
otherwise. Then, G†P with respect to σ is shown in Figure 1(c), where an arc, say,
from u to v, means σ(u, v) = 0. There are seven P-components contained in G†P , as

either all vertices of G are fault-free or all vertices of G are faulty. So, we assume
|CM | ≥ 2. Let C(1)M = {{x} : {x} ∈ CM} be the set of all 1-vertex M-components in
G†M . Clearly, C
(1)
M ⊆ CM .
Lemma 1. Suppose that Λ is a fault-free aggregate in G with |Λ| ≥ Δ + 2. If
{x} ∈ C(1)M and x ∈ Λ, then |N(x) ∩ Λ| ≤ 1 under the MM* model.
Proof. We have Λ − (N(x) ∪ {x}) not empty, as a consequence of |Λ| ≥ Δ + 2.
Suppose that z ∈ Λ − (N(x) ∪ {x}) is adjacent to (N(x) ∪ {x}) ∩ Λ, i.e., z ∈ N(y1)
for some y1 ∈ N(x) ∩ Λ. If |N(x) ∩ Λ| ≥ 2, then there exists y2 ∈ N(x) ∩ Λ − {y1}.
Consequently, σ(y1, y2;x) = 0 and σ(x, z; y1) = 0, i.e., y1 ∈ ΥM (x) and x ∈ ΥM (y1),
which means that x and y1 belong to the same M-component, which is a contradiction.
In Appendix A, we list some important variables and notation that are used in
this paper.
3. Identiﬁcation of fault-free aggregates. Since all neighbors of a fault-free
aggregate are faulty, faulty vertices can be found provided some fault-free aggregates
are identiﬁed. Recall that when (t, k)-diagnosis is concerned, the number of faulty
vertices is bounded above by t. For the PMC model, since each fault-free P-component
is a fault-free aggregate, a vertex subset in G can be guaranteed to be a fault-free
aggregate provided it is a P-component and has size greater than or equal to t + 1.
In other words, t+ 1 is a threshold for guaranteeing a fault-free aggregate under the
PMC model. Let ζP denote such a threshold. Clearly, t+ 1 is a feasible value of ζP .
In the rest of this section, we consider the MM* model and use ζM to denote
a threshold for guaranteeing a fault-free aggregate. Since a fault-free aggregate may
contain multiple M-components under the MM* model, it is not an easy problem to
determine a feasible value of ζM . In the following, we intend to ﬁnd a feasible value of
ζM , together with some conditions, so that a vertex subset in G can be guaranteed to
be a fault-free aggregate under the MM* model provided it satisﬁes these conditions
and has size greater than or equal to ζM .
First, a suﬃcient and necessary condition for a subset V ′ of V with |V ′| ≥ Δδ−2 ×
t(≥ Δ + 2) to be a fault-free aggregate is proposed below.
Lemma 2. Suppose that V ′ = (
⋃
1≤i≤mXi) ∪ (
⋃
1≤j≤n Yj) is a subset of V and
|V ′| ≥ Δδ−2 × t (≥ Δ + 2), where m ≥ 0, n ≥ 0, Xi ∈ C(1)M , Yj ∈ CM − C(1)M , and
δ > 2. Then, under the MM* model, V ′ is a fault-free aggregate in G if and only if
the following ﬁve conditions hold:
(C1) |N(Xi) ∩ V ′| = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m;
(C2) N(Xi) ∩ V ′ ⊆
⋃
1≤j≤n Yj for 1 ≤ i ≤ m;
(C3) n = 1;
(C4) for each Xi = {xi}, xi ∈ ΥM (yi) for some yi ∈ Y1;
(C5)
⋃
1≤i≤mXi =
⋃
Xj∈C(1)
′
M
Xj, where C
(1)′
M = {Xj : Xj = {xj} ∈ C(1)M and xj ∈
ΥM (yj) for some yj ∈ Y1}.
Proof. (⇒) (C1) Clearly, |N(Xi) ∩ V ′| ≥ 1. On the other hand, since Xi ∈
C
(1)
M is fault-free, Lemma 1 ensures that Xi has at most one fault-free neighbor, i.e.,
|N(Xi) ∩ V ′| ≤ 1. So, |N(Xi) ∩ V ′| = 1.
(C2) Suppose conversely that (N(Xr)∩V ′)∩ (
⋃
1≤i≤mXi) is not empty for some
1 ≤ r ≤ m. By (C1), N(Xr) ∩ V ′ = Xl, where 1 ≤ l ≤ m and l 
= r. It follows
that there is no arc between Xl ∪ Xr and V ′ − (Xl ∪ Xr), i.e., |V ′| = 2, which is a
contradiction.

1286 GUEY-YUN CHANG AND GEN-HUEY CHEN
Lemma 1 ensures that each fault-free vertex in
⋃
1≤i≤mXi has at least δ−1 faulty
neighbors. As a consequence of (C1), (C2), and (C3), |N(Xi)∩V ′| = |N(Xi)∩Y1| = 1
for each Xi. Since Y1 is faulty, each fault-free vertex in
⋃
1≤i≤mXi has at least δ − 2
faulty neighbors outside V ′. Also notice that each vertex of G has indegree (and
outdegree) smaller than or equal to Δ. So, we have
α× (δ − 2) ≤ β ×Δ.(3)
Combining (1) and (3), we have
α× (δ − 2) < t×Δ.(4)
On the other hand, since β ≥ α×(δ−2)Δ (from (3)), (2) can be written as follows:
t× (Δ− δ + 2) ≤ (α− β)× (δ − 2)
≤
(
α− α× (δ − 2)
Δ
)
× (δ − 2)
=
α× (Δ− δ + 2)× (δ − 2)
Δ
,
from which t×Δ ≤ α× (δ − 2) is derived, which is a contradiction to (4).
Next, we show that V ′ is an aggregate in G. Suppose conversely that V ′ is not
an aggregate. Then, V ′ is a proper subset of a fault-free aggregate Λ, and there exists
an M-component Z in G†M with Z ⊂ Λ − V ′. By (C3), we have Z ∈ C(1)M ; by (C4),
we have Z ⊆ ⋃
Xj∈C(1)
′
M
Xj . Further, (C5) ensures that Z ⊆
⋃
1≤i≤mXi ⊂ V ′, which
is a contradiction.
According to Lemma 2, when the ﬁve conditions hold, Δδ−2 × t can be a threshold
for guaranteeing a fault-free aggregate under the MM* model (i.e., set ζM to be
Δ
δ−2 × t). In the next section, it is shown that the value of t under the MM* model
depends on ζM , and in section 5,
Δ
δ−2 × t is evaluated in order to compute the degrees
of (t, k)-diagnosability for grids and tori.
4. (t, k)-diagnosability. In [23], Khanna and Fuchs deﬁned a function φ in
order to determine a lower bound on the degree of sequential diagnosability of a
general graph G. In this section, we intend to determine a lower bound on the
degree of (t, k)-diagnosability of G. We assume that the diagnosis model is the MM*
model. The discussion for the PMC model is all the same. We need only to replace
M-component, G†M , and ζM with P-component, G
†
P , and ζP , respectively. First we
adapt the deﬁnition of φ to (t, k)-diagnosis, as elaborated below.
Suppose that V ′ ⊂ V and {V1, V2, . . . , Vr} is a partition of V ′ so that the induced
subgraph of each Vi in G is strongly connected and no arc exists between Vi and
Vj if i 
= j. Let π(Vi) denote the set of all possible partitions of Vi, and deﬁne
Π(V ′) = {π1 ∪ π2 ∪ · · · ∪ πr : πi ∈ π(Vi) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r} to be the set of all possible
partitions of V ′ that are induced by further partitioning V1, V2, . . . , Vr. An illustrative
example is shown in Figure 3, where V ′ = V1 ∪ V2 is the set of all black vertices in
G. For our purpose, V ′ = F is the fault set of G, each Vi is a faulty aggregate in G,
and each element (i.e., a subset of Vi) of πi ∈ π(Vi) is a faulty M-component in G†M
under the MM* model.
Suppose that W ⊆ V −V ′ and the induced subgraph of W in G−V ′ is maximally
strongly connected. For each Γ ∈ Π(V ′), let ϑΓ,W = ΣZ∈Γand Z∩N(W ) =∅|Z|, which

components that are neighboring to the fault-free aggregateW under the MM* model.
Definition 4. Suppose that G = (V,A) is a directed graph. Deﬁne Φ(χ1, χ2) to
be the greatest integer p so that for each subset V ′ of V with |V ′| ≤ p, there exists
W ⊆ V − V ′ satisfying the following three conditions:
(C1) the induced subgraph of W in G− V ′ is maximally strongly connected;
(C2) |W | ≥ χ1;
(C3) ξV ′,W ≥ χ2 provided W ⊂ V − V ′.
Recall that the process of (t, k)-diagnosis is iterative. In each iteration (exclusive
of the last iteration), at least k faulty vertices can be identiﬁed provided there are at
most t faulty vertices in G. For the purpose of (t, k)-diagnosis under the MM* model,
we let V ′ = F , χ1 = ζM , and χ2 = q¨, where Φ(ζM , q¨) ≥ Φ(ζM , q) for all nonnegative
integers q. Then, G is (tˆ, kˆ)-diagnosable under the MM* model, where tˆ = Φ(ζM , q¨)
and kˆ = q¨. We have |F | ≤ tˆ(= Φ(ζM , q¨)). There are at least kˆ faulty vertices identiﬁed
in each iteration (exclusive of the last iteration), as explained below.
There is a fault-free aggregate W with |W | ≥ ζM , which is guaranteed by (C1)
and (C2). Moreover, W can be identiﬁed, according to the discussion of section 3.
Suppose that n total iterations are required to complete the (tˆ, kˆ)-diagnosis of G. Let
F (i) be the resulting fault set of G at the beginning of the ith iteration, and let W (i)
be the fault-free aggregate identiﬁed in the ith iteration, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Without
loss of generality, suppose that W (i) ⊂ V − F (i) for i < m and W (i) = V − F (i) for
i ≥ m, where 1 < m ≤ n. For 1 ≤ i < m, at least q¨(= kˆ) faulty vertices of G can
be identiﬁed in the ith iteration, which is ensured by (C3). For m ≤ i < n, at least
q¨(= kˆ) faulty vertices of G can be identiﬁed in the ith iteration as well, which is shown
in Appendix B. In the nth iteration, all remaining faulty vertices of G are identiﬁed.
In the rest of this section, we aim to evaluate tˆ(= Φ(ζM , q¨)) and kˆ(= q¨) under
the MM* model. By Lemma 3, we have ξV ′,W ≥ κ(G) if W ⊂ V − V ′. Refer to
Deﬁnition 4 again. We have Φ(ζM , κ(G)) ≥ Φ(ζM , q) for all nonnegative integers q.
So, q¨ = κ(G) is a feasible value of kˆ. On the other hand, if (C3) holds for χ2 = q¨,
then (C3) holds for χ2 < q¨ as well. That is, Φ(ζM , q¨) ≤ Φ(ζM , q¨ − 1) ≤ · · · ≤
Φ(ζM , 0). Also, since Φ(ζM , q¨) ≥ Φ(ζM , q) for all nonnegative integers q, we have
Φ(ζM , q¨) = Φ(ζM , 0). In order to evaluate Φ(ζM , 0), we deﬁne Φˆ(χ1) = min{|V ′′| :
V ′′ ⊂ V and there is no W ′ ⊆ V − V ′′ with |W ′| ≥ χ1 so that the induced subgraph
of W ′ in G− V ′′ is maximally strongly connected}. Clearly, Φ(ζM , 0) = Φˆ(ζM )− 1.
Further, in order to evaluate Φˆ(ζM ), we let AV˜ = {(z1, z2) : z1, z2 ∈ V˜ and (z1, z2)
is an arc in G}, where V˜ ⊆ V , and deﬁne I(α) = max{|AV˜ | : V˜ ⊆ V and |V˜ | = α} to
be the maximal number of arcs in G whose two end vertices are contained in a ﬁxed
α-vertex subset of V . It is rather diﬃcult to evaluate I(α); instead, an approximation
of I(α) is evaluated below. Let Iˆ : [0, |V |] → R+ ∪ {0} be a convex function with
Iˆ(0) = 0 and Iˆ(α) ≥ I(α) for all positive integers α, where [0, |V |] denotes the set of
real numbers ranging from 0 to |V | and R+ denotes the set of all positive real numbers.
Notice that Iˆ is a continuous function deﬁned on [0, |V |], while I is a discrete function
deﬁned on {0, 1, 2, . . . , |V |}. We have the following lemma.
Lemma 4. Suppose that V ′ ⊂ V and {W1,W2, . . . ,Wr} is a partition of V −V ′ so
that the induced subgraph of each Wi in G−V ′ is maximally strongly connected, where
1 ≤ i ≤ r. If |Wi| < ζM for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r, then Σri=1Iˆ(|Wi|) ≤ Σ
r
i=1|Wi|
ζM
× Iˆ(ζM ).
Proof. Since Iˆ is convex, we have Iˆ(x)−Iˆ(0)x ≤ Iˆ ′(x), where Iˆ ′(x) is the ﬁrst-
order derivative of Iˆ(x). Hence, x × Iˆ ′(x) − Iˆ(x) ≥ 0. Let h(x) = Iˆ(x)x . Then,
h′(x) = x×Iˆ
′(x)−Iˆ(x)
x2 ≥ 0. That is, Iˆ(x)x is nondecreasing. So, Iˆ(ζM )ζM ≥
Iˆ(|Wi|)
|Wi| for all

Gd(n1, n2, . . . , nd), is the graph obtained by Pn1 ⊗ Pn2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Pnd , where each ni
(1 ≤ i ≤ d) is the length of dimension i. There are n1 × n2 × · · · × nd vertices
contained in Gd(n1, n2, . . . , nd). In subsequent discussion, we use Gd(n) to represent
Gd(n1, n2, . . . , nd) with n1 = n2 = · · · = nd = n. Figure 5 shows the topology of
G2(5).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 

Fig. 5. The topology of G2(5).
For Gd(n), we have |A| = 2×d×(|V |−|V | d−1d ) (see [23]), Iˆ(α) = 2×d×(α−α d−1d )
(see [23]), Δ = 2 × d, and δ = d (considering each edge of Gd(n) bi-directional).
Moreover, we have κ(Gd(n)) = d. Then, as a consequence of Theorems 6 and 7, we
have the following two theorems.
Theorem 8. Gd(n) is (Ω(|V | dd+1 ),Ω(d))-diagnosable under the MM* model.
Proof. According to Theorem 6, we have
tˆ′ =
|A| × ζM − |V | × Iˆ(ζM )

and kˆ = κ(Gd(n)) = d.
Since ζM =

tˆ′ > 1−|V |

(tˆ′, kˆ)-diagnosable, G is also (tˆ′′, kˆ)-diagnosable for all tˆ′′ < tˆ′. Hence, the theorem
follows.
Theorem 9. Gd(n) is (Ω(|V | dd+1 ),Ω(d))-diagnosable under the PMC model.
Proof. Similarly, according to Theorem 7, we have

which can be derived from (8). Hence, the theorem follows.
5.2. Tori. If we replace each path Pni of Gd(n1, n2, . . . , nd) with a cycle Cni , then

Proof. According to Theorem 6, we have
tˆ′ =
|A| × ζM − |V | × Iˆ(ζM )

Since ζM =

Theorem 14. T2(n) is (Ω(|V | 23 ), 4)-diagnosable under the PMC model.
Proof. Similarly, according to Theorem 7, we have
(12) tˆ′ =
|V | ×min{2×√ζP ,
√|V |}
2× ζP + min{2×

Since ζP = tˆ

Hence, the theorem follows.
The values of Iˆ(α) for Gd(n1, n2, . . . , nd) with n1 ≤ n2 ≤ · · · ≤ nd and Td(n) with
even d were computed in [4] and [9], respectively. Their (t, k)-diagnosability can also
be obtained by the aid of Theorems 6 and 7.
6. Discussion and conclusion. Research on fault diagnosis has spanned about
40 years, and now emphasis has shifted toward the identiﬁcation of a large fraction
of faulty processors, i.e., sequential diagnosis and (t, k)-diagnosis. Now that (t, k)-
diagnosis is a generalization of sequential diagnosis, we focused our attention on (t, k)-
diagnosis under two popular diagnosis models: PMC and MM*. Theorems 6 and 7,
which are the main results of this paper, suggested lower bounds on the degrees of
(t, k)-diagnosability of general multiprocessor systems under the two models.
Previously, lower bounds on the degrees of (t, k)-diagnosability of general multi-
processor systems under the PMC model were proposed in [1]. An immediate conse-
quence of [1] is that under the PMC model, Gd(n) is (2×
√
N − 2× d+ 2+ d− 3, d)-
diagnosable if N ≥ 2 × d + 7 and (N+d+23 , d)-diagnosable otherwise, and Td(n) is
(2×√N − 4× d+ 2+2×d−3, 2×d)-diagnosable if N ≥ 4×d+7 and (N+4×d+23 , 2×d)-
diagnosable otherwise, where N = nd is the number of processors. By the aid of The-
orems 6 and 7, we have shown in this paper that Gd(n) and Td(n) are (Ω(N dd+1 ),Ω(d)-
diagnosable and (Ω(N
d
d+1 ),Ω(2× d))-diagnosable, respectively, under both the PMC
and the MM* models.
Matching composition networks (MCNs), which were ﬁrst proposed in [24], in-
clude hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed cubes, and Mo¨bius cubes. Their (t, k)-
diagnosability under the PMC and the MM* models was investigated in [12] and [13],
respectively. The values of Iˆ(α) for MCNs are available in [12]. When applying them
to Theorems 6 and 7, we can obtain the same results as in [12] and [13]. In Table 3, we
summarize the degrees of the (t, k)-diagnosability in asymptotical notations of Gd(n)
and Td(n) that are derivable from [1], [12], [13], and this paper.

We also evaluate the degrees of the (t, k)-diagnosability for some particular Td(n)’s
in Tables 4, 5, and 6. They show that our result (i.e., Theorem 12) is superior to
the result of [1] for all experimental values of n. Moreover, the value of t obtained
from Theorem 12 increases more quickly than that obtained from [1] as the value of n
increases. Table 4 also shows that the result of Theorem 14 is better than the result
of Theorem 12 for n = 40, 80, . . . , 10240, which is a consequence of using a tighter
upper bound of I(α) (i.e., a smaller value of Iˆ(α)). A better (t, k)-diagnosability will
result from Theorems 6 and 7 if a tighter upper bound of I(α) is used.
In order to apply Theorems 6 and 7, the values of Iˆ(ζP ) and Iˆ(ζM ) must be
available. Previously, the values of Iˆ(α) were computed for some particular graphs,
e.g., Cartesian power of regular graphs [6], products of trees [7], powers of the Petersen
graphs [5], and products of complete p-partite graphs [6]. Their (t, k)-diagnosability
can be obtained as well by the aid of Theorems 6 and 7.

also induce a diagnosis process that will identify at least q¨ faulty vertices in the m′th
iteration, which is a contradiction.
Appendix C. Proof of Lemma 10. We denote each vertex v of Td(n) by a
d-tuple (v1, v2, . . . , vd), where each vi, ranging from 0 to n − 1, is the ith coordinate
of v. Suppose that H is a set of α vertices in Td(n). We ﬁrst recoordinate the vertices
of Td(n) so that
(1) the minimum of the ith coordinates of all vertices in H is 0,
(2) the maximum of the ith coordinates of all vertices in H is xi,
(3) xi obtained in (2) is minimum, i.e., there is no coordinate system of Td(n) in
which there exists x′i < xi and for each v = (v1, v2, . . . , vd) ∈ H, 0 ≤ vi ≤ x′i,
and
(4) 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xd ≤ n− 1,
where 1 ≤ i ≤ d.
Along a ﬁxed dimension, say, γ, we ﬁrst partition Td(n) into n Td−1(n)’s, denoted
by T1, T2, . . ., Tn, where 1 ≤ γ ≤ d and each Ti contains all the vertices of Td(n) whose
γth coordinates are i. Without loss of generality, assume x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xμ < n− 1
and xμ+1 = xμ+2 = · · · = xd = n − 1, where 0 < μ ≤ d. If 1 ≤ γ ≤ μ, then Txγ+1
contains no vertex in H. In order to estimate Iˆ(α), we intend to minimize the number
of arcs that each have one end vertex in H and the other end vertex not in H, as
elaborated below.
Let EH,γ(v′1, . . . , v′γ−1, v′γ+1, . . . , v′d) = {(v′1, . . . , v′γ−1, uγ,q1 , v′γ+1, . . . , v′d), (v′1, . . . ,

in H that have the same jth coordinate v′j for j ∈ {1, . . . , γ − 1, γ + 1, . . . , d}
and have diﬀerent γth coordinates uγ,q1 ≤ uγ,q2 ≤ · · · ≤ uγ,qp . When (uγ,q1 −
1)mod n 
∈ {uγ,q1 , uγ,q2 , . . . , uγ,qp} (or (uγ,qp + 1)mod n 
∈ {uγ,q1 , uγ,q2 , . . . , uγ,qp}),
the arc ((v′1, . . . , v

v′d))) is referred to as an out-arc (thus named because (uγ,q1 − 1)mod n (or (uγ,qp +
1)mod n) is out of the range from uγ,q1 to uγ,qp).
On the other hand, when (uγ,qi − 1)mod n 
∈ {uγ,q1 , uγ,q2 , . . . , uγ,qp} and uγ,q1 ≤
(uγ,qi − 1)mod n ≤ uγ,qp (or (uγ,qi + 1)mod n 
∈ {uγ,q1 , uγ,q2 , . . . , uγ,qp} and uγ,q1 ≤
(uγ,qi + 1)mod n ≤ uγ,qp), the arc ((v′1, . . . , v′γ−1, uγ,qi , v′γ+1, . . . , v′d), (v′1, . . . , v′γ−1,
(uγ,qi − 1)mod n, v′γ+1, . . . , v′d)) (or ((v′1, . . . , v′γ−1, uγ,qi , v′γ+1, . . . , v′d), (v′1, . . . , v′γ−1,
(uγ,qi +1)mod n, v

γ+1, . . . , v

d))) is referred to as an in-arc. Both out-arcs and in-arcs
are directed from vertices in H to vertices not in H. A lower bound on the number
of out-arcs is estimated below.
When 1 ≤ γ ≤ μ, there are at least 2∗ |{(v1, . . . , vγ−1, vγ+1, . . . , vd) : EH,γ(v1, . . . ,
vγ−1, vγ+1, . . . , vd) 
= ∅}| arcs that each have one end vertex in H and the other end
vertex not in H, because (uγ,q1 − 1)mod n 
∈ {uγ,q1 , uγ,q2 , . . ., uγ,qp} and (uγ,qp +
1)mod n 
∈ {uγ,q1 , uγ,q2 , . . ., uγ,qp}. Clearly, 2 ∗ |{(v1, . . . , vγ−1, vγ+1, . . . , vd): EH,γ(v1,
. . . , vγ−1, vγ+1, . . . , vd) 
= ∅}| ≥ min{|Hi| : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}, where Hi is the set of vertices
in H that are located in Ti. The equality holds when |H1| = |H2| = · · · = |Hn| and
for i 
= j, if v ∈ Hi, then there exists u ∈ Hj so that the coordinates of u and v diﬀer
only in dimension γ.
When μ < γ ≤ d, there are at least |{(v1, . . . , vγ−1, vγ+1, . . . , vd) : EH,γ(v1, . . . ,
vγ−1,vγ+1, . . . , vd)
