Abstract—This paper considers the design of active queue management (AQM) H   
state estimator and state feedback controller for the congestion control in transmission 
control protocol (TCP) with time-varying interval delay and uncertain parameters. 
The time-varying interval delay is with both the upper and lower bounds of the delay 
and the uncertain parameters are norm-bounded. In TCP networks, the 
packet-dropping probability function is taken into account as a control input in the 
TCP/AQM networks in order to be modeled as a saturated input. By using a 
Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach and linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, a 
delay-dependent condition for the existence of the desired queue size of  H   
estimator and state feedback control law is proposed. To avoid complex mathematical 
derivations and conservative results, a new hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) 
method is integrated with linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques to get the 
estimator and feedback controller gain to satisfy the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional 
stability inequalities. The proposed new approach is straightforward and well adapted 
to the computer implementation. Therefore, the computational complexity can be 
reduced remarkably and facilitate the design task of the estimator and controller for 
uncertain TCP/AQM network with time-varying interval delays. Two illustrative 
examples are exploited in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed state 
estimator. 
Keywords: Transmission control protocol (TCP), active queue management (AQM), 
linear matrix inequality (LMI), hybrid Taguchi genetic algorithm, time-varying 
interval delays.

problem for uncertain time-delay TCP/AQM network system were presented in [5], no 
delay-dependent H   control results on uncertain time-delay TCP/AQM network system are 
available in the literature, which motivates the present study. 
In this paper, the robust AQM H   control problem is addressed for congestion control in 
TCP with time-varying interval delay and uncertain parameters containing input saturation, 
where the parameter uncertainties are assumed to be a norm-bounded. The objective is to 
design controllers such that in the presence of time delay as well as parameter uncertainties, 
the closed-loop control system is robust stability and also satisfies a prescribed H   
disturbance attenuation index. To avoid complex mathematical derivations and conservative 
results, first, a new integrative technique is proposed. By employing the newly proposed 
integrative approach, the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is integrated with the 
linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) method to seek the controllers that satisfy the 
Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional stability inequalities, where the LMI method is used to 
derive the stability conditions of the estimation error dynamics and time-varying interval 
delays are directly considered in the stability problem formulation, which show that the 
proposed control strategy has reliable asymptotic stability and robust against variations in the 
round-trip time (RTT), the number of TCP sessions, the bursting and the unresponsive flows, 
etc. The reason why the HTGA is applied in this paper is that [16]-[17] have shown that the 
HTGA may obtain better and more robust results than those existing improved genetic 
algorithms. An important feature of the result reported is that all the sufficient conditions are 
dependent on the upper and lower bounds of the delays. Another feature of the results lies in 
that it involves fewer matrix variables and upper bound techniques are not introduced to 
reduce the conservatism of the criteria. Simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness 
and applicability of the proposed new integrative approach.

  The AQM scheme will be proposed in the aforementioned model. The designed robust 
H   controller can not only reduce the sensitivity to network parameters but also eliminate 
inaccuracies due to the use of the linear model with a saturated input. Before formulating the 
problem to be investigated, we first introduce the following stability concept for the system 
(21) and (22).

attenuation level  . If it is stable and under zero initial conditions

3. Mathematical formulation of the proposed approach 
  This section is dedicated to the design of a state estimator for the asymptotically 
delay-dependent stability in (21) and (22) with disturbance attenuation level  . The analysis 
commences by using the LMI approach to develop some results which are essential to 
introduce the following Lemmas for the development of our main theorem.

Step 8: Calculate the fitness values of n  experiments in the orthogonal array )2( 1nnL  by 
using the estimator gain L  and feedback controller K  in (18) and (19), where we 
give a penalty on the fitness value for the chromosome. 
Step 9: Calculate the effects of the various factors. 
Step 10: One optimal chromosome is generated based on the results from Step 9. 
Step 11: Repeat Step 7 through 10 until the expected number cPG  has been met. 
Step 12: The population via the Taguchi method is generated. 
Step 13: Mutation operation. The probability of mutation is determined by mutation rate mP . 
Step 14: Offspring population is generated. 
Step 15: Sort the fitness values in increasing order among parents and offspring populations. 
Step 16: Select the better G  populations feasible for the constraint as parents of the next 
generation. 
Step 17: Has the stopping criterion been met? If yes, go to Step 18. Otherwise, return to Step 
4 and continue through Step 17. 
Step 18: Set 1 rr . If mr  , go to Step 19. Otherwise, go to Step 3. 
Step 19: Display the optimal chromosomes and the optimal fitness values. 
Remark 2. The contributions of this method HTGA are that: (1) no extra constraints are 
attached, (2) the synthetic procedures only use simple mathematical derivations and 
fundamental control concepts, and (3) it is much more flexible than related works, because 
estimator gain matrix and feedback gain matrix and LMI condition can be solved, 
respectively. In other words, all LMI-based AQM congestion control schemes syntheses with 
estimator gain matrix and feedback gain matrix free of redefining the stability constraints.  
Remark 3. No model transformation has been presented in deriving the delay-dependent 
estimator gain matrix L  and feedback gain matrix K  in Theorem 1. It should be noted that 
in deriving delay-dependent stability conditions, a common approach is transform the original 
system to another one by means of the Newton-Leibniz formula. In this framework, usually 
we have to utilize some bounding techniques to find upper bounds for the inner product 
between two vectors. These bounding techniques involve some matrix inequalities. Applying 
these inequalities will inevitably increase conservatism into the derived conditions. However, 
it is worth emphasizing that in our derivation, no system transformation and thus no 
inequality is needed for seeking upper bounds of the inner product between two vectors. This 
feature has the potential to enable us to get less-conservative results. 
Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the advantages of this estimator gain 
matrix L  and feedback gain matrix K  design method developed in this paper.

control in transmission control protocol (TCP) with time-varying interval delay and uncertain 
parameters are tracked very well by the proposed state estimator. The effectiveness and

The objective of PSO-TVAC is to enhance the global 
search in the early part of the optimization and to encourage 
the particles to converge toward the global optimum at the 
end of the search. With a large cognitive parameter and small 
social parameter at the beginning, particles are allowed to 
move around the search space, instead of moving toward the 
population best. However, a small cognitive parameter and a 
large social parameter allow the particles to converge to the 
global optimum in the latter part of the optimization. Under 
this development, the cognitive parameter c1 starts with a 
high value c1max and linearly decreases to c1min. Whereas the 
social parameter c2 starts with a low value c2min and linearly 
increases to c2max. This modification can be mathematically 
represented as follows:

where Tmax is the maximal number of iterations and t  is the 
current number of iterations. 
III. CELLULAR NEURAL NETWORK 
A two-dimensional CNN array is considered in which the 
cell dynamics are described by the following nonlinear 
ordinary differential equation with linear and nonlinear terms

xij, uij, yij,, Iij are the state, input, output and threshold voltage 
of the specified CNN cell, respectively. A(i,j;k,1) is called 
the feedback cloning template, B(i,j;k,1) is called the 
feedforward or input control template, Dij;kl are nonlinear 
terms applied for v ( v is a generalized difference). The 
state and output vary in time, the input is static (time 
independent), and the CNN is single-layer with nearest 
neighbor linear. 
In this paper, Dij;kl is the generalized nonlinear term 
applied to )()( txtuv ijkl   , the voltage difference of 
either the input or state values. The nonlinear template D is 
as follows: 
 
 
                                                                                              
                                                                                           (7) 
 
 
 
 
 
where d0, d1, d2 ,are the parameters in the nonlinear template 
D. K should be set very close to this value in an attempt to 
separate the noise effects and the image structure. 
 
IV. CNN BASED ON PSO-TVAC TEMPLATE LEARNING 
A digital image is composed of pixels which can be 
thought of as small dots on the screen and may be 
represented as m-by-n matrices. MATLAB is a matrix 
processing language for a wide range of applications. The 
color image in MATLAB is described as a two dimensional 
matrix in uint8 format. In order to apply the gray image noise 
cancellation from the precious study [8], we separate the 
color image into RGB elements. These three Gray-Scale 
images will be blend into a colorful image after finishing 
noise cancellation processes proposed. The process followed 
to perform noise cancellation is shown in Fig. 1

In this case, PSO-TVAC is employed to design templates 
of CNN for canceling the noise interference in Gray-Scale 
images. The templates are designed as following pattern 
structures, respectively: 
 
 
 
                                                                                         (8) 
 
 
 
where a0, a1, a2 ,b0, b1, b2 ,d0, d1, d2, I, K are elements of 
the swarm, in order to satisfy output saturation effectively, 
we set a2 =0 , b0 =0, b1 =0, b2 =0, I=0, xij(0)= uij(t). The 
training image is corrupted by the salt and pepper noise 
shown in Fig. 2.

By comparing Fig. 12(a) - 12(c) with Fig. 13(a) - 13(c), 
and Table 4, our proposed method (PSO-TVAC-CNN) 
could restrain from noise of the polluted image more 
effectively than PSO-CNN. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a Cellular Neural 
Network templates learning method that combined Particle 
Swarm Optimization with Time-Varying Acceleration 
Coefficients, applied to color image noise cancellation. 
Template learning is a crucial step in cellular neural network 
technology. The implementation of PSO-TVAC-CNN is a 
contribution to the modern heuristics research in the image 
processing area. From the demonstrated examples, the 
proposed algorithm shows the better performance of the 
noise cancellation for color image than PSO-CNN.  
In the future research, we hope to improve the adaptive 
templates training to repair the color images that are 
polluted by the higher density of miscellaneous noises. For 
real applications, the proposed method may be implemented 
and fabricated on FPGA or VLSI technology.
