Abstract 
The utilization of guard traces with two ground vias at both ends to improve the 
eye opening and jitter for serpentine delay lines has been investigated. However, it is 
not easy to accomplish using normal manufacturing technology nowadays because the 
position of the pad of grounded via is surrounded by serpentine trace. This is 
especially true in normal manufacturing technology, in which size of the via pad is 
larger. Therefore, this study proposes crosstalk noise reduction of the time-domain 
transmission (TDT) waveform and eye diagram of the serpentine delay line by guard 
trace stubs, i.e. the guard trace of one end is grounded via and the other is open-end, 
with stripline structure. The crosstalk reduced efficiency for using guard trace stubs is 
the same as when using guard traces on the time domain of the serpentine delay line. 
This is because, the open-end leads to the noise cancellation mechanism of the guard 
trace stub. Based on HSPICE simulation, it demonstrates that the utilization of the 
guard trace stubs can reduce the original TDT crosstalk level by more than 50%, 
thereby greatly improving the eye opening and jitter. Finally, this study also performs 
time-domain  
measurement to validate the proposed analyses.

domain transmission (TDT) waveform and eye diagram. In 
addition, for the sake of simple description in following 
section, the only two guard traces denote the number of 
grounded vias and the via position is at both ends. Moreover, 
for the guard trace stub denoting the guard trace, one end is a 
grounded via and the other end is open-ended. 
Based on HSPICE simulation, it is demonstrated that the 
utilization of the guard trace stubs can reduce the original TDT 
crosstalk level by more than 50%, thereby greatly improving 
eye opening and jitter. Finally, time-domain measurement is  
also performed to validate the proposed analyses. 
II. SERPENTINE DELAY LINE WITH GUARD TRACE STUBS 
First, assume that the serpentine delay line shown in Fig. 
1(a) is matched at both ends. A ramp pulse of rise time tr is 
launched at the sending end of the delay line. It is known that 
the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) among the sections of a 
serpentine delay line accumulates in phase and appears as a 
laddering wave on the TDT waveform [1]. Moreover, the 
maximum voltage level of the laddering wave approximates 
,max ( 1)laddering nV N V= − × ,                         (1) 
where N is the section number of the serpentine delay line and 
Vn is the magnitude of near-end crosstalk among the 
neighboring sections. It is well known that the saturated 
NEXT levels in the victim line can be formulated as [9], with 
respect to the input voltage, Vi,

in which knear is the backward coupling coefficient, Lm is the 
mutual inductance, LS is the self-inductance, Cm is the mutual 
capacitance, and CS is the self-capacitance.  
In addition, in a serpentine delay line inserted with guard 
traces, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the maximum voltage level of 
the laddering wave is also approximated by formula (1) and 
(2). However, the knear should be modified to knear,g, knear,g 
which denotes that the backward coupling coefficient of 
parallel lines inserted a guard trace. Further, the grounded via 
number of the guard trace of the serpentine delay line is only 
two and the via position is at both ends for the microstrip and  
stripline structure [11].  
Consider a serpentine delay line with guard trace stubs in 
stripline structure as shown in Fig. 1(c). In the cross-sectional 
view in Fig. 2, W = 1.4mm, S = 2.1mm, H = 3.2mm, T = 
0.035mm, Wg = 0.7mm and L = 30mm. The driver and load 
resistances are chosen as RS=RL=50Ωwhile the rise time of the 
source VS(t) is 50ps. Figure 3 shows the circuit model used in 
HSPICE simulation for the guard trace inserted serpentine 
delay line. For the sake of simplicity, as shown in Fig. 3, the 
grounded vias at the ends of the guard trace stubs are 
connected to the ground by an “ideal short” line because the 
influence of the equivalent model, an inductor, on the 
simulated waveform is not significant. 
Figure 4 shows the comparison of simulated the TDT and 
TDR (time-domain reflection) waveforms of the serpentine 
delay line with guard traces and guard trace stubs for the same  
structural dimensions. It is obvious that for the two cases, the 
TDT and TDR waveforms of the serpentine delay line have 
almost the same results. Therefore, under the current 
conditions normal manufacturing technology, the guard trace 
stubs can be easily inserted into the serpentine delay line to 
reduce the crosstalk noise. In addition, the approximate 
formulas of the maximum voltage level of the laddering wave 
for serpentine delay line inserted guard trace stubs are the 
same as those inserted for guard traces.

Owing to the serpentine configuration, the forward 
propagating noises resulting from to the insertion of guard 
traces can be cancelled at the receiving and driving ends if the 
guard trace is shorted with two grounded vias at both ends 
[12]. However, the inserted guard trace stub at one end is 
grounded via and the other end is open. Although the parallel 
striplines inserted in the guard trace stub can result in large 
amount of extra crosstalk noise [10], the noise cancellation 
mechanism still appears at the open end on the guard trace 
stub. Hence, the TDT and TDR waveforms of the serpentine 
delay line have almost the same results when inserting guard 
traces or guard trace stubs. 
The physical mechanism of noise cancellation can be 
briefly described as follows. When a ramped pulse propagates 
along trace section #1 of the serpentine delay line shown in Fig. 
3, it will cause NEXT1 to propagate toward the left-hand side

From the comparisons between Fig.9 and Fig.10, the eye 
width of the serpentine delay line inserted with guard trace 
stubs increased by 26ps and eye high increased by 533mV, 
respectively, in the bathtub curve at BER 10-12. 
V. CONCLUSION  
 In order to reduce the near-end crosstalk noise at the 
receiving end of the serpentine delay line of the time-domain 
and to ease the implementation process, this study inserts 
guard trace stubs between the parallel lines of the serpentine 
delay line. Moreover, the TDT and TDR waveforms of the 
serpentine delay line have almost the same simulated results 
for the insertion of guard traces and guard trace stubs. 
Consequently, as demonstrated by the HSPICE simulations 
and reflectometry measurement, the TDT waveform and eye 
diagram can be improved significantly. The reduction in the 
maximum voltage level of the laddering wave by adding guard 
trace stubs can be easily calculated. Furthermore, with larger 
deterioration of the main signal in the serpentine delay line, 
greater improvement of TDT waveform and eye diagram 
can be achieved by using guard trace stubs
