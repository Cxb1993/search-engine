Ⅱ. Experiment 
P-type, (100) orientation, 4-inch diameter 
silicon wafers with 1-10 Ω-cm resistivity were 
used as the starting substrates. A 500 nm SiO2 
films was first grown on silicon wafers by wet 
oxidation. The oxide on the backside was then 
removed. Boron was implanted on the backside 
(2x1015 /cm2, 30 keV) to make substrate contact. 
A rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was performed 
at 800 ? in N2 for 5 minutes to activate the 
boron implant. After standard RCA clean, the 
tunnel oxide (SiO2) with a thickness of 3 nm was 
thermally grown by dry oxidation at 900 ?. The 
high-k dielectric layers were then deposited by 
RF magnetron sputtering under a pressure of 
9.8x10-3 torr at room temperature in argon gas. 
The purity of Dy2O3 and HfO2 target is 99.9 %. 
The thickness of the high-k dielectric layers 
ranges from 6 to 10 nm. The high-k dielectric 
films were either as-deposited, or annealed at 
400 ?, 600 ? or 700 ?. The annealing was 
performed in nitrogen at a flow rate of 3 
standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm). 
After annealing, the blocking oxide (SiO2) was 
deposited by high density plasma chemical 
vapor deposition (HDP-CVD) Duratek system at 
350 ? in an ambience of argon and O2 gas. The 
thickness of the blocking oxide is 10 nm. The 
400 nm-thick top and bottom aluminum 
electrodes were evaporated by e-beam 
evaporation. Post-metallization annealing (PMA) 
was performed at 400 ? in N2 for 30 seconds. 
The crystalline phase of the high-k dielectric 
films was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
using Cu Kα radiation. 
The I-V characteristics were measured using 
Keithley 236 electrometer and the C-V 
characteristics using high frequency C-V meter 
MegaBytek Mi-494. 
 
. Result and DiscussionⅢ  
A. Leakage current of MOHOS capacitors 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the current density 
versus applied voltage (J-V) curves of the 
MOHOS capacitors with Dy2O3 and HfO2 high-k 
dielectrics layers annealed at temperatures 
ranging from 400 ? to 700 ?. The lowest 
leakage current of MOHOS capacitors with 
Dy2O3 was obtained at an annealing temperature 
of 400 ?. The lowest leakage current of 
MOHOS capacitors with HfO2 was obtained at 
600 ?. The Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si capacitor 
has lower leakage current than Al/SiO2/HfO2/ 
SiO2/Si capacitor. 
In comparison with literature results, the 
leakage current density of 10-8 A/cm2 for 
Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si capacitors is lower than 
that of Pt/HfAlO/SiN/SiO2/Si capacitors at 10-4 
A/cm2 [11] and Pt/Al2O3/SiN/HfO2/Si capacitors 
at 10-2 A/cm2 [12], all measured at the same 
voltage of 8 V. This is most likely due to the 
larger conduction band offset at the Dy2O3/SiO2 
interface.  
 
B. The dependence of MOHOS C-V memory 
window on high-k dielectric film thickness  
Fig. 5 and 6 show the C-V memory windows 
of MOHOS capacitors with different Dy2O3 
thicknesses. The thicknesses of the Dy2O3 films 
are 10 and 6 nm and the memory windows are 
1.88 V and 0.99 V, respectively. The MOHOS 
memory window increases with increasing 
Dy2O3 film thickness because more charges can 
be kept in thicker charge storage layer [13]. The 
trap charge density in the charge storage layer 
calculated from the flat band voltage shift of Fig. 
5 is 4.16x1012 /cm2 [5, 14]. 
 
C. Retention properties of MOHOS 
capacitors 
Fig. 7 shows the retention time measurement 
of MOHOS capacitors with as-deposited Dy2O3 
films and Fig. 8 shows the same with Dy2O3 
films annealed at 500 ?. The C-V characteristic 
is first measured with a sweep voltage from -2 to 
2 V to determine the original flat band voltage. 
Stress voltage pulses of +10 V and -10 V at 1 
second duration were then applied for program 
and erase, respectively. The flat band voltage 
shift is then measured at different time periods. 
A minimum detection window of 0.5 V can be 
maintained after 2x108 seconds for MOHOS 
capacitors with as-deposited Dy2O3 films 
whereas only 1.5x107 seconds for MOHOS 
capacitors with Dy2O3 films 
rapid-thermal-annealed (RTA) at 500 ?. This 
suggests that the recrystallization of Dy2O3 film 
will generate grain boundaries which can act as 
current leakage paths and degrade retention 
properties [8].  
 
D. MISFETs with SOHOS structure 
MIS field effect transistors with the MOHOS 
structure were successfully fabricated. The 
IDS-VDS characteristics of the MISFETs are 
shown in Fig. 9. 
 
IV. Conclusion 
In summary, MOHOS capacitors with Dy2O3 
and HfO2 high-k dielectric films as charge 
storage layers are fabricated. The electrical 
properties including C-V memory window, 
leakage current, and retention time were 
measured. The memory windows are 1.88 V and 
0.99 V for Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si capacitors 
with Dy2O3 film thicknesses of 10 and 6 nm, 
respectively. The leakage current density of
