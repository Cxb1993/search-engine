Abstract 
Wideband communication applications such 
as OFDM and future systems are expected to 
provide advanced multimedia services 
requiring increasing data traffic demands. The 
performance of such systems can be severely 
degraded by nonlinear effects of power 
amplifiers. The need for achieving high 
power-conversion efficiency, reducing sidelobe 
regrowth and meeting bit error rate 
requirements implies amplifier linearization is a 
necessary issue. A great many techniques have 
been proposed to minimize the performance  
 
 
                                     
                                           -1- 
 
degradation caused by nonlinear distortion. 
Baseband predistortion is a cost effective 
technique to achieve this goal. In this project, 
we intend to understand and compare 
amplifier modeling, predistorter design and 
adaptation implementation in wideband 
systems. Design and implementation of 
digital predistorters are demonstrated. 
Adaptive algorithms are developed and 
analyzed. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations 
are performed to evaluate the predistorter 
design. Performance in terms of total 
degradation and power spectral density are 
evaluated.

一、 前言 
寬頻系統如正交分頻多工系統具有高的
頻寬效率，且能夠對抗多重路徑衰減干擾的
優點；其主要的缺點為具有高的峰值對平均
功率比。由於高的峰對平均功率比，使得經
過高功率放大器的信號，受到放大器的影響
而被截掉，引起失真。最簡單消除的方法，
降低傳送到放大器信號強度，使得操作點落
在線性區；但此作法會造成功率效益過低。
基頻的數位預扭器能夠有效線性化放大器以
提升功率效益。當數信號經過非線性放大器
時，其輸出會有頻譜再生的現象，而造成鄰
近通道的干擾。因此，線性化功率放大器降
低位元錯誤率的同時，也必須能夠抑制頻譜
再生。

systems, a single look-up table designed to be optimal for a
speciﬁc OBO is used as the basis of generating predistorted
symbols for other operating points in this technique. This
optimum look-up table is called the “generator look-up table”
which is a DP with memory illustrated in Section III.
The symbol sequence {an} is an independent and iden-
tically distributed T -spaced sequence of complex symbols
chosen from a square 16-QAM constellation with equal prob-
abilities. Root raised cosine ﬁlters with roll-off factors of 0.25
are used in the transmitter and receiver (both truncated to a
length of 16 symbols). The cascade of the transmit and receive
ﬁlters produces a raised cosine ﬁlter with a unit voltage gain
at the center. According to the required output power level
or OBO, the gain control device provides the corresponding
ﬁxed voltage gain to linearly scale the transmitted signal
pulse (modulated by the corresponding symbols {bn} from
the generator look-up table) to meet the OBO requirement.
Such a combination of the generator look-up table with the
gain control device forms the basis of the proposed technique
named as a look-up table with amplitude scaling technique. As
a result, the transmitted predistorted symbols are not optimum
any more for such an OBO (except when the OBO is the
same as the one that the generator look-up table is based upon).
Since performance degradation can be expected by using
suboptimal predistorted symbols, it is important to ﬁnd out
how signiﬁcant such a degradation is over multiple operating
points in order to decide which optimum look-up table is a
better choice for the generator look-up table in this technique.
Two types of nonlinear ampliﬁer models are considered:
the traveling wave tube ampliﬁer (TWTA) and the solid state
power ampliﬁer (SSPA). In either case, the output y(t) of the
nonlinear ampliﬁer is given by
y(t) = F (|x(t)|) exp (jΦ(|x(t)|) + j arg (x(t))) (1)
where |x(t)| is the amplitude (nonnegative voltage envelope)
of x(t), arg (x(t)) is the phase of x(t), F(·) is the AM/AM
conversion and Φ(·) is the AM/PM conversion. The AM/AM
of the TWTA is a Saleh’s model whereas that of the SSPA is
a model proposed in [4].

and for the SSPA

where Psat is the saturation (maximum) output power of the
ampliﬁer and the overbar indicates the mean resulting from a
time-average.
The output y(t) is then disturbed by an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and ﬁltered by the root raised cosine
ﬁlter and sampled per symbol time interval assuming perfect
carrier and symbol synchronization. In simulations where the
transmitted power varies, a method of gain control at the
receiver in order that decision thresholds are set optimally is
needed. In principle, phase compensation could be done at
the transmitter part which would involve a table for phase
as a function of OBO in the gain control block. But it
is a reasonable expectation that the receiver can do the
phase compensation anyway (and results ought to be similar).
Therefore, phase compensation is done at the receiver if nec-
essary. For the SSPA model which introduces zero AM/PM,
the receiver compensation block does amplitude scaling to
optimally gain control the received signal for the ﬁxed decision
device thresholds (or adjusting the decision device thresholds
according to the resulting OBO in a simulation). For the
TWTA model, it has been observed that amplitude scaling
alone is insufﬁcient. Therefore, the receiver compensation
block does both amplitude scaling and phase compensation
(e.g., a single-tap linear equalizer is used here) to adjust the
received signal to meet the ﬁxed decision device thresholds in
terms of minimizing the mean squared error. Assuming that
Gray code is employed, the BER is obtained by dividing the
symbol error rate by log2 M (strictly speaking this relationship
between SER and BER holds only for relatively low SER).
III. DATA PREDISTORTER WITH MEMORY
The DP with memory in [1] is based on global compen-
sation of the nonlinearity. Each predistorted symbol bn is a
function of past, present, and future input symbols (an−L,
· · ·,an−1,an,an+1 · · ·, an+L) where 2L + 1 is the memory
length. Consider an M−point desired signal constellation. The
DP with memory has a look-up table with M 2L+1 entries
(M2L predistorted values for each symbol in the M−point
signal constellation).
The DP with memory can be implemented via a look-
up table structure. In order to reduce the required number
of memory entries, the set-partitioning concept in which the
signal constellation is partitioned into a number of square

SSPA Model
For the SSPA model in (3), only amplitude scaling is
employed at the receiver. The simulation results are shown
in Fig. 6 - Fig. 8 for the look-up table with amplitude scaling
technique. OBOs ranging from around 2.5 dB up to 6 dB are
considered in most cases.
The performance of the corresponding unpredistorted sys-
tem has been found to be very close to the curve (5) in Fig. 6
from the simulations. This result is not surprising since very
little predistortion is required at OBO = 6 dB. Among these
four generator look-up tables (LUT3, LUT4, LUT5 and LUT6),
it has been observed that LUT4, on the average, is the best
generator look-up table for any type of the DP with memory
and target BER. The optimum generator look-up table can
be expected to be the one based on OBO around 4 dB. A

V. CONCLUSIONS
A look-up table with amplitude scaling technique based on
the DP with memory has been developed and investigated
to address the problem of predistorter design for multiple
operating points. The optimum look-up tables corresponding
to multiple OBOs are used to serve as the candidates for the
generator look-up table. The TD performance of this technique
has been shown for both the TWTA and SSPA model. Though
optimum performance can not be met at every OBO using the
best generator look-up table, relatively good performance can
be achieved with low memory size and simple implementation.

systems, a single look-up table designed to be optimal for a
speciﬁc OBO is used as the basis of generating predistorted
symbols for other operating points in this technique. This
optimum look-up table is called the “generator look-up table”
which is a DP with memory illustrated in Section III.
The symbol sequence {an} is an independent and iden-
tically distributed T -spaced sequence of complex symbols
chosen from a square 16-QAM constellation with equal prob-
abilities. Root raised cosine ﬁlters with roll-off factors of 0.25
are used in the transmitter and receiver (both truncated to a
length of 16 symbols). The cascade of the transmit and receive
ﬁlters produces a raised cosine ﬁlter with a unit voltage gain
at the center. According to the required output power level
or OBO, the gain control device provides the corresponding
ﬁxed voltage gain to linearly scale the transmitted signal
pulse (modulated by the corresponding symbols {bn} from
the generator look-up table) to meet the OBO requirement.
Such a combination of the generator look-up table with the
gain control device forms the basis of the proposed technique
named as a look-up table with amplitude scaling technique. As
a result, the transmitted predistorted symbols are not optimum
any more for such an OBO (except when the OBO is the
same as the one that the generator look-up table is based upon).
Since performance degradation can be expected by using
suboptimal predistorted symbols, it is important to ﬁnd out
how signiﬁcant such a degradation is over multiple operating
points in order to decide which optimum look-up table is a
better choice for the generator look-up table in this technique.
Two types of nonlinear ampliﬁer models are considered:
the traveling wave tube ampliﬁer (TWTA) and the solid state
power ampliﬁer (SSPA). In either case, the output y(t) of the
nonlinear ampliﬁer is given by
y(t) = F (|x(t)|) exp (jΦ(|x(t)|) + j arg (x(t))) (1)
where |x(t)| is the amplitude (nonnegative voltage envelope)
of x(t), arg (x(t)) is the phase of x(t), F(·) is the AM/AM
conversion and Φ(·) is the AM/PM conversion. The AM/AM
of the TWTA is a Saleh’s model whereas that of the SSPA is
a model proposed in [4].

and for the SSPA

where Psat is the saturation (maximum) output power of the
ampliﬁer and the overbar indicates the mean resulting from a
time-average.
The output y(t) is then disturbed by an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and ﬁltered by the root raised cosine
ﬁlter and sampled per symbol time interval assuming perfect
carrier and symbol synchronization. In simulations where the
transmitted power varies, a method of gain control at the
receiver in order that decision thresholds are set optimally is
needed. In principle, phase compensation could be done at
the transmitter part which would involve a table for phase
as a function of OBO in the gain control block. But it
is a reasonable expectation that the receiver can do the
phase compensation anyway (and results ought to be similar).
Therefore, phase compensation is done at the receiver if nec-
essary. For the SSPA model which introduces zero AM/PM,
the receiver compensation block does amplitude scaling to
optimally gain control the received signal for the ﬁxed decision
device thresholds (or adjusting the decision device thresholds
according to the resulting OBO in a simulation). For the
TWTA model, it has been observed that amplitude scaling
alone is insufﬁcient. Therefore, the receiver compensation
block does both amplitude scaling and phase compensation
(e.g., a single-tap linear equalizer is used here) to adjust the
received signal to meet the ﬁxed decision device thresholds in
terms of minimizing the mean squared error. Assuming that
Gray code is employed, the BER is obtained by dividing the
symbol error rate by log2 M (strictly speaking this relationship
between SER and BER holds only for relatively low SER).
III. DATA PREDISTORTER WITH MEMORY
The DP with memory in [1] is based on global compen-
sation of the nonlinearity. Each predistorted symbol bn is a
function of past, present, and future input symbols (an−L,
· · ·,an−1,an,an+1 · · ·, an+L) where 2L + 1 is the memory
length. Consider an M−point desired signal constellation. The
DP with memory has a look-up table with M 2L+1 entries
(M2L predistorted values for each symbol in the M−point
signal constellation).
The DP with memory can be implemented via a look-
up table structure. In order to reduce the required number
of memory entries, the set-partitioning concept in which the
signal constellation is partitioned into a number of square

SSPA Model
For the SSPA model in (3), only amplitude scaling is
employed at the receiver. The simulation results are shown
in Fig. 6 - Fig. 8 for the look-up table with amplitude scaling
technique. OBOs ranging from around 2.5 dB up to 6 dB are
considered in most cases.
The performance of the corresponding unpredistorted sys-
tem has been found to be very close to the curve (5) in Fig. 6
from the simulations. This result is not surprising since very
little predistortion is required at OBO = 6 dB. Among these
four generator look-up tables (LUT3, LUT4, LUT5 and LUT6),
it has been observed that LUT4, on the average, is the best
generator look-up table for any type of the DP with memory
and target BER. The optimum generator look-up table can
be expected to be the one based on OBO around 4 dB. A

V. CONCLUSIONS
A look-up table with amplitude scaling technique based on
the DP with memory has been developed and investigated
to address the problem of predistorter design for multiple
operating points. The optimum look-up tables corresponding
to multiple OBOs are used to serve as the candidates for the
generator look-up table. The TD performance of this technique
has been shown for both the TWTA and SSPA model. Though
optimum performance can not be met at every OBO using the
best generator look-up table, relatively good performance can
be achieved with low memory size and simple implementation.
