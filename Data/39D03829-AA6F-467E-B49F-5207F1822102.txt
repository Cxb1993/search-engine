Abstract 
In the satellite transmission environment, the 
received signal contains the components via 
multipath transmission. If the transmission 
bandwidth is larger than the mobile channel, the 
intersymbol interference (ISI) will degrade the 
performance of the system. Customarily, the 
adaptive equalizer is adopted to combat the 
interference. However, conventional equalizers 
employ a training sequence that is known at both 
side of transmitter and receiver. The training 
sequence is used to adjust the coefficients (tap 
weights) of the equalizer. Many algorithms have 
been proposed and have been in practical. However, 
the equalizer must track the time-varying channel in 
the wireless communication environment 
periodically. 
In the time-varying satellite channel, the equalizer 
needs to track the channel variants. The code-aided 
equalizer is proposed with two stage equalizers. 
First stage equalizer works as the conventional 
equalizer to obtain the optimum received signal. 
Secondary stage equalizer is used to track the 
time-varying channel. It could be applied in the 
mobile fading environment. The system 
performance analysis has been presented. Recently, 
Low Density Parity-Check code with iterative turbo 
algorithm has been proposed to demonstrate the 
properties of good codes capable of asymptotically 
approaching Shannon limit. In this performance 
evaluation project, the code-aided equalizer using 
LDPC coding with iterative turbo algorithm scheme 
under a satellite fading channel is proposed. Under 
the fading channel, the performance of the equalizer 
will be investigated. Because of the remarkable 
error performance of LDPC code, it could be 
adapted to many applications and related electronic 
industry in the satellite communication.

I.  Introduction 
In the satellite transmission environment, the 
intersymbol interference (ISI) will degrade the 
performance of the system if the transmission 
bandwidth is larger than the mobile channel. 
Customarily, the adaptive equalizer is adopted to 
combat the interference. Conventional equalizers 
employ a training sequence that is known at both 
side of transmitter and receiver to adjust tap 
weights of the equalizer. Many algorithms have 
been proposed and have been in practical. However, 
the equalizer must track the time-varying channel in 
the wireless communication environment 
periodically. The bandwidth efficiency could be 
degraded because of the training sequence. 
Besides, in the time-varying channel, the equalizer 
needs to track the channel variants. The adaptive 
algorithm would be updated the incorrect 
coefficients of the equalizer when the decision 
errors are made. The existing adaptive equalizers 
attempt to minimize the mean square error of some 
aspect of a received signal with the respect to the 
desired aspect of that signal. Using a training 
sequence is the conventional and easy method [1]. 
Several algorithms have been developed, such as 
squared sum error algorithm, absolute sum error 
algorithm. Using the time-domain deconvolutional 
algorithm, estimating the channel response, the 
adaptive equalizer has been discussed. Without the 
aid of training sequences, the blind equalizer is 
derived based on the known statistics of the 
transmitted signal [2]. Based on the estimate of 
probability density function of the received signal 
to minimize the estimated bit error rate, the 
adaptive equalizer has been proposed [3]. Specially, 
the equalizer would not work well via the adaptive 
adjustment when the burst errors occur. The 
information between the transmitter and receiver 
would not lose until the equalizer is re-initialized. 
To combat the effects of the burst error in the 
wireless channel, employing the interleaving and 
correct coding could be helpful in the adaptive 
procedure. It provides a solution to improve the 
tracking performance of the adaptive equalizer.

III. LDPC Code-aided Linear Iterative 
Turbo Equalizer (LITE) 
The function of equalizer helps the distorted signal 
to be recovered. It improves the performance of a 
communication system. Also, coding schemes 
provide a benefit on a better communication system. 
Combing with equalizer and coding scheme, a 
code-aided LITE uses a LDPC coding scheme with 
a iterative turbo decoding algorithm for decoding 
is proposed [16].  
The decoding algorithm is to find the most probable 
vector x such that Hx=0 (mod 2). As in Fig. 3, the 
log likelihook (LLR) from a bit node vi to its 
neighbor check node vj is denoted as vi→j while 
the log likelihood message from a check node 
to its neighbor bit node is denoted as ui→j with

where y is the received vector. Denote div as the 
number of the neighbor check nodes for a bit node 
vi and djc as the number of neighbor bit nodes for a 
check node uj. The two iterative equations are given 
as

the decoding algorithm. 
Else, if the maximum iterative reached, the 
decoding algorithm fails. 
           Else return to step 2 and continue. 
 
The major concern in the proposed equalizer is the 
scenario to update the tape weights of the equalizer. 
At the receiver, the algorithm for LITE is as 
1. Repeat the following steps until a termination 
criterion (MMSE) is reached.

(d) If the termination criterion is not 
satisfied back to step 2(a). 
2. OUTPUT data: the hard decisions for symbols 
b%  based on 1Eoutε  and 2Eoutε . 
where E1 and E2 represent the first stage equalizer 
and second stage equalizer, respectively. εin and εout  
represent the input of equalizer and output of 
equalizer, respectively. 
 
IV. Simulation and Results 
For numerical analysis, the simulation uses a LDPC 
encoder with a coding rate 1/2. In the equalizer, the 
hardware structure of the finite impulse response 
filter (FIR) with 10 tapes is shown in Fig. 4. 
To adjust the tap weight of the equalizer, the 
equalization algorithm adopts Least Mean Square 
(LMS). This LMS algorithm is given as 
C(n+1)=C(n)+µe(m)r(m)                (12) 
where C(n) is the tap weight vector of the equalizer 
at time n, r is the input vector to the equalizer at 
time n and µ is a constant (0<µ<1).  
e(m)=ε-εout                            (13)
