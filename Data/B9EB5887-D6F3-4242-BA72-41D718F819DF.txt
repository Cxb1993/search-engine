ABSTRACT 
 
The objective of this research is to study the key combustion characteristics of reforming 
fuels that could be used as a short term solution to the immediate need for CO2 and NOx 
reductions, and provides a transitional strategy to a carbon free energy system in the future. 
The goal is to replace fossil fuel usage as much as possible with environmentally friendly, 
clean and renewable energy sources (pure hydrogen or biomass fuels) for greenhouse gas 
reduction. Unfortunately, the use of pure hydrogen or gasified biomass fuels in industrial 
combustors remains difficulties due to production, storage, cost, and safety concerns. 
Therefore, the use of hydrogen addition with traditional fossil fuels is an alternative toward 
pollutant emission reductions. Nonetheless, the applications of reforming fuels to practical 
combustion systems rely on fundamental understanding of the characteristics of 
multi-component fuels. 
The main focus of the present study is to thoroughly investigate the detailed laminar 
burning velocity, flame stability limits, flame structures, and chemical kinetics mechanisms of 
blended fuels (H2/CH4/CO) through experimental measurements and numerical simulations. 
Direct photograph of the flame, chemiluminescence emission of OH*, and laser-induced 
predissociative fluorescence (LIPF) of OH techniques are employed to determined the flame 
front position. Flame temperatures are measured by thermocouple. Particle imaging velocity 
(PIV) technique is used to measure the flowfield velocity. While the PREMIX and OPPDIF 
codes from CHEMKIN Collection 3.5 in conjunction with GRI-Mech 3.0 chemical kinetic 
mechanisms as well as detailed transport properties are used for laminar burning velocity, 
flame structure and chemical kinetic structure calculations. 
Experimental measurements and numerical simulations of the flame front position, 
temperature, and velocity are performed in the stoichiometric CH4/CO/air opposed-jet flames 
with various CO contents in the fuel. The measured flame front position, temperature, and 
velocity of the stoichiometric CH4/CO/air flames are closely predicted by the numerical 
calculations.  Detailed analysis of the calculated chemical kinetic structures reveals that as 
the CO content in the fuel is increased from 0% to 80%, CO oxidation (R99) increases 
significantly and contributes to a significant level of heat-release rate. It is also shown that the 
laminar burning velocity reaches a maximum value (57.5 cm/s) at the condition of 80% of CO 
in the fuel. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, the chemistry of CO consumption 
shifts to the dry oxidation kinetics when CO content is further increased over 80%.  
Comparison between the results of computed laminar burning velocity, flame temperature, 
CO consumption rate, and sensitivity analysis reveals that the effect of CO addition on the 
laminar burning velocity of the stoichiometric CH4/CO/air flames is due mostly to the 
transition of the dominant chemical kinetic steps. 
Experimental and numerical studies of the the stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air

development, and demonstration of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.  Their goal is to 
make practical and cost-effective fuel-cell vehicles widely available in auto showroom by 
2020.  Since hydrogen can be produced from many domestic sources of energy, including 
fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal; renewable energy sources, such as solar radiation, 
wind, and biomass; and nuclear energy, the diversity of hydrogen sources would make the 
widespread use of hydrogen for transportation and stationary power that is an important step 
in protecting the future energy security.  Although hydrogen is a vision of future energy, the 
cost-effective of hydrogen production, delivery, storage, manufacturing, safety, and fuel cell 
conversion, etc is a significant challenge.  Hydrogen is not a fuel that exists in nature in a 
readily usable form, such as oil or coal.  It more closely resembles electricity-an energy 
carrier that must be generated from another fuel source.  Therefore, researches on hydrogen 
related technologies are underway all over the world and Taiwan, as a Nation of energy 
shortage, should keep upon the research trend of the world. 
In addition to hydrogen, biomass is another attractive renewable fuel.  The use of 
biomass fuels provides substantial benefits as far as the environment is concerned.  Biomass 
absorbs CO2 during growth, and emits it during combustion.  Therefore, biomass helps the 
atmospheric CO2 recycling and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.  Biomass 
consumes about the same amount of CO2 from atmosphere during growth as is released 
during combustion.  The average majority of biomass energy is produced from wood and 
wood waste (64%), followed by solid waste (24%), agricultural waste (5%) and landfill gases 
(5%) [8]. There are three ways to use biomass.  It can be burned to produce heat and 
electricity directly, gasified to gas-like fuels with composition of hydrogen (H2), methane 
(CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) or changed to a liquid fuel.  Liquid fuels, also called 
bio-fuels, include ethanol (C2H5OH) and methanol (CH3OH).  The most commonly used 
bio-fuel is ethanol, which is produced from sugarcane, corn and other grains.  The use of 
gasoline and ethanol blended fuel for cars has been very popular in Brazil.  Although the use 
of biomass energy possesses many unique advantages, the combustion of biomass remains 
some technological problems.  For instance, the compositions of biomass among fuel types 
are considerable variable.  Direct combustion of biomass fuel in furnaces and power boilers 
may result in the critical problems of fouling and slagging.  Therefore, the use of gasified 
biomass that contains a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane, together with 
carbon dioxide and nitrogen, is more versatile than the original solid biomass.  However, it 
should be noticed that in comparison with solid fossil fuels, biomass contains much less 
carbon and more oxygen and has a low heating value.  Thereby, it becomes essential to 
develop combustion techniques that can burn the gasified biomass or low-grade syngas 
effectively. 
In Taiwan, a lot of efforts have been devoted to seeking the way for CO2 reduction.  
Among these efforts, the research and development of fuel cell related technology is one of 
the examples.  Indeed, the use of fuel cell that utilizes hydrogen as a fuel not only produces 
  4
on the effects of hydrogen addition on the global performance of gas turbine combustors or jet 
flames and the resultant pollutant emissions.  None of the studies has focused on the effect 
of chemical kinetic of blended fuels on flame stability and pollutant emissions. 
1-2 Motivation 
In order to understand the effect of chemical kinetics of hydrogen blended fuels on flame 
stability and pollutant emissions, laminar jet flames or counterflow (opposed) flames were 
frequently employed for such a study [24], due to its experimental simplicity and exclusion of 
complex turbulence-chemistry interactions.  The effect of hydrogen and methane addition on 
the propagation and extinction of atmospheric CO/air flames was investigated experimentally 
and numerically [25].  Effects of pressure and dilution on the extinction of nonpremixed 
hydrogen-air were also experimentally and computationally studied [26].  Both studies have 
used counterflow, twin-flame and laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDV) techniques for the 
determination of laminar flame speeds and extinction strain rates.  The simulations were 
conducted by using the one-dimensional flame code with detailed transport model and C2 
chemistry.  Further experimental and numerical study of the strain-rate effects on 
hydrogen-enhanced lean premixed methane/air flames was reported [27].  Again, LDV and 
1-D flame code were respectively employed for strain rate measurements and for numerical 
predictions, while sampling quartz microprobe was used for major species concentration 
measurements.  Computational studies using a modified version of OPPDIF code [28] and 
using direct numerical simulation [29] were performed to investigate the effects of hydrogen 
addition on flame stability and pollutant formation of stretched methane/air premixed flames.  
The influence of hydrogen addition on the response of lean premixed methane flames to high 
strained flows was also experimentally and numerically investigated using LDV and 1-D 
flame code, respectively [30].  Experimental and numerical studies on the extinction limits 
of counterflow premixed and nonpremixed methanol and ethanol flames were reported 
recently [31]. 
Literature survey indicates that previous studies mainly concentrated on the 
characteristics of H2/CH4/air combustion.  Little attention has been paid to the combustion 
characteristics of reforming fuels such as H2/CH4/CO/air, which are the major constituents of 
biomass fuels.  In addition, experimental studies were focused on the velocity derived 
laminar flame speed and strain rate measurements.  A few of temperature and species 
concentration measurements [22, 30] has been made.  Thereby, comparisons of experimental 
results with numerical predictions were limited to the effect of hydrogen addition on the flame 
stability.  No detailed comparison of measured thermochemical flame structures with model 
predictions has been reported to elucidate the effect of hydrogen addition on chemical kinetics, 
laminar burning velocity, and flame structures of reforming fuels and to valid the combustion 
models for future applications.  This motivates the needs to thoroughly investigate these 
issues.

CHAPTER II 
METHODOLOGY 
 
2-1 Experimental Methods 
 
The experimental setup is schematically shown in Fig. 1. The opposed-jet burner consists of 
two water cold, well-contoured circular nozzles (i.d. = 2 cm) with slow coaxial shielding 
flows (Fig. 1a). Two premixed CH4/CO/air jets are directed towards each other to form two 
symmetrical, planar flames. Both premixed flames are operated at the fixed stoichiometric 
condition while the volumetric concentration of CO is varied from 0 to 100% in the blended 
fuel. The separation distance between two nozzles is 2 cm and the bulk velocity at each jet 
exit is maintained at 1 m/s for the present study. Research-grade fuels and compressed air are 
metered by electronic mass flowmeters and mixed in a mixing chamber prior to the 
opposed-jet burner. The compressed air is filtered and dried by using a refrigeration dryer, 
and the dew point can be reduced to −20◦C. The flame is shielded from ambient air by a 
nitrogen coaxial flow with low velocity, which is controlled using a rotameter. The 
uncertainties of the rotameter for coaxial nitrogen stream and mass flowmeters for methane 
and carbon monoxide are ±2.5% and ±1.0% of full scale, respectively. The experimental 
conditions and corresponding net heating values of mixtures and adiabatic flame temperatures 
of the premixed stoichiometric CH4/CO/air opposed-jet flames are listed in Table 1. Note that 
the adiabatic flame temperature is calculated under the unstrained condition and it increases 
with the CO content in the fuel mixture. Moreover, in order to clarify the effect of molecular 
diffusion of in the stretched flame with different molecular weights, the Lewis numbers, 
which are defined as the ratio of thermal diffusivity and mass diffusivity for the mixture of 
methane, carbon monoxide and oxygen, are also shown in Table 1. In experiments, the 
non-intrusive particle image velocimetry (PIV) and qualitative laser-induced predissociative 
fluorescence (LIPF) of OH imaging are applied to measure the flow velocity and flame front 
position, respectively. The visible flame features are obtained using a high sensitivity 3-chip 
color CCD camera (Sony DXC-9000) and digitized by the frame grabber for further digital 
image processing to identify the flame front position. An R-type (Pt/Pt–13Rh) thermocouple 
with 25 μm wire diameter is used to measure the flame temperature. BeO and 10–15% Y2O3 
coating is applied to eliminate catalytic reactions induced by platinum in the flame [32]. The 
measured temperature in the flame is corrected for radiation heat loss by assuming a spherical 
thermocouple bead [33, 34]. 
The PIV system including two Nd:YAG lasers and optics is shown in Fig. 1b. The laser 
beams from the two lasers are aligned with the optics through two polarizers and a wave plate. 
The resulting beam is then expanded by three cylindrical lenses into a thin sheet of 
approximately 0.7 mm thickness, which is actually measured on the projection screen. The 
time interval of the PIV system is controlled by a pulse signal/delay generator. The fuel and 
air streams are seeded with sieved fine Al2O3 particles of sizes less than 10 μm. A 
  8
properties are functions of the axial distance only. The adaptive regridding method is applied 
to solve the flame structure, and the grid independence of the solutions is achieved by tuning 
the GRAD and CURV parameters in the package. The number of grid lines is set to more than 
400 for each case. The minimum grid dimension is approximately 0.1 μm, which is sufficient 
to resolve the flame thickness and the steep temperature gradient. 
 
 
  10
mixtures could increase the flame propagation and influence the chemistry and structure of 
premixed CH4/CO/air flames. The results of mixing-rule methods, which are calculated based 
on Spalding’s method [41], of Payman and Wheeler’s method [42], and 
flame-temperature-based methods [40] show different trends from those of the numerical 
simulations. Mixing rules predict a monotonic decrease of the burning velocities with 
increasing CO content in the blended fuel, which contradicts the present numerical simulation 
and previous experimental studies [44] as it reaches a maximum when CO is increased to 
80% in the fuel mixture. Recall that the adiabatic flame temperature increases with an 
increase in CO vol% in the fuel, from 2264 K at 10% CO to 2385 K at 96% CO (see Table 1). 
The increase in flame temperature should, in principle, increase the burning velocity. 
Therefore, it is clear that the mixing rule is not valid for laminar burning velocity predictions 
in CH4/CO/air flames. The effect of CO variations on the laminar burning velocity will be 
further discussed in Section 3.4. 
3-2 Flame Appearance and Flame Front Position 
Photographs of the premixed stoichiometric CH4/CO/air opposed-jet flames with 
different CO volumetric contents in the CH4–air mixtures are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a shows 
that for 100% of CH4 in fuel, two symmetrical, planar flames exist and the flames are blue in 
color. When 10% of CO is added to the fuel, the postflame zone (region between two planar 
flames) immediately becomes orange in color (Fig. 6b). The flame emission becomes bright 
as the CO concentration is increased to 70% in volume (Fig. 6h). For the pure CO premixed 
flame, the flame becomes silver-white in color around the center and blue near the edge of the 
flame as shown in Fig. 6m. It is also noted that the separation distance between the two 
symmetrical flames increases with increasing CO concentration. The separation distance 
reaches a maximum value for flame 9 (Fig. 6i) and then decreases as the CO concentration is 
further increased. For the pure CO flame (Fig. 6m), the two symmetrical, planar flames 
almost merge into a single flame. Fig. 6 indicates that the addition of CO to the CH4–air 
mixtures changes the flame front position. The radiation from the post flame especially for the 
cases with higher CO composition is induced from decomposition of metal carbonyls [46]. 
CO stored in high pressure cylinder results in contamination from iron pentacarbonyl as the 
CO reacts with the iron content in the cylinder wall. According to prior papers, addition of 
CO pentacarbonyl may affect studies on flame ignition and extinction phenomena. 50 ppm 
iron pentacarbonyl addition may reduce laminar burning velocity of stoichiometric 
methane–air flames by 20% [47]. In general, averaged concentration of iron pentacarbonyl in 
CO from steel cylinder is about 869 ppb [48]. For experiments, semiconductor-grade CO 
which has been filtered and stored in alumina cylinder is suggested to apply in further study in 
the future. Fortunately, the contamination of iron pentacarbonyl does not seem to severely 
affect flame stabilization locations of stretched flame. 
In order to determine the flame front position, direct photograph and single-shot 
  12
model can accurately predict the general flame characteristics. This, in turn, validates the 
correct settings of the boundary conditions in the model and also shows the capability of the 
combustion model and mechanism used for the current CH4/CO/air flame calculations. This 
fact suggests that the model can be used for further analysis of the flame chemical structures 
as the composition of the blended fuel is varied. 
 
3-4 Chemical Kinetic Structures 
In order to further understand the effect of the variation of blended fuel composition on 
flame characteristics, detailed flame structures of four characteristic flames selected, as 
indicated in Fig. 8, are examined. The profiles of the temperature, species mole fraction, 
production rate, net reaction rate, and heat-release rate of the major elementary steps along the 
jet axis are plotted in Figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14 for flames 1, 5, 9, and 12, respectively. In the 
figures the dashed line indicates the axial location of the peak temperature gradient which 
separates the preheat zone and the oxidation zone. Figs. 11a and 11b show that the 
distributions of temperature, species mole fraction, and production rate are typical of 
premixed stoichiometric methane flame. The production of CO is primarily from the 
oxidation of CH4 and the CO oxidation starts after the CH4 has been consumed to a large 
extent. Figs. 11c and 11d show the net reaction rate and the heat-release rate of major 
elementary steps. The most significant reaction is the chain-branching reaction 
H + O2 ↔ OH + O                                                       (R38) 
followed by the OH attack on H2 through reaction 
OH+H2 ↔ H + H2O                                                      (R84) 
to form the product H2O and to further build up the H radical pool. Both the reactions 
OH+CH4 ↔ CH3 + H2O                                                   (R98) 
and 
H +CH4 ↔ CH3 + H2                                                     (R53) 
play an equivalent role in the dehydrogenation of methane in this premixed CH4/air flame, 
but the reaction (R98) occurs slightly prior to the reaction (R53). The production of the 
intermediate CO is mainly from the reactions 
O +CH3 → H + H2 + CO                                                 (R284) 
and 
O2 + HCO ↔ HO2 + CO                                                 (R168) 
The oxidation of CO is mainly through reaction 
OH + CO ↔ H + CO2                                                    (R99) 
  14
the CO kinetics. It can be seen from Fig. 13c that in the preheat zone, the rate of reaction 
HO2 + H ↔ OH + OH                                                    (R46) 
for OH production and the rate of reaction (R99) for CO oxidation exceed that of reactions 
(R98) and (R53) for the dehydrogenation of methane. Therefore, in the preheat zone, the OH 
radicals react with CO through a faster reaction rate compared to that of methane oxidation 
and hence, results in a faster CO consumption rate (Fig. 13b). In the oxidation zone, the large 
amount of OH produced from reaction (R38) is mainly for CO oxidation reaction, though the 
dehydrogenation of methane through reaction (R98) is still very active. Thus the reaction 
(R99) almost dominates the overall reaction rate (Fig. 13c) and contributes most of the 
positive heat-release in the preheated and oxidation zones (Fig. 13d). 
As the concentration of CO is further increased to 96%, the calculated axial distribution 
of variables is shown in Fig. 14 for flame 12 (4% CH4–96% CO). For such a large amount of 
additive CO in the fuel mixture, the CH4 chemistry plays only a minor role in the overall 
reaction as evident by the consumption rates of CH4 and CO (Fig. 14b). Fig. 14c also shows 
that the rate of methane dehydrogenation reactions (R98) and (R53) is much less than the rate 
of OH production reactions (R38) and (R46). The produced OH radicals accelerate the CO 
oxidation through reaction (R99) which contributes to the overall heat release of this flame. 
Comparison of the computed chemical kinetic structures reveals that for a fixed 
stoichiometry of the CH4/CO/air flame, the flame temperature and the reaction rate of reaction 
(R99) increase with increasing CO content in the fuel mixture; and they reach a maximum 
value at 80% of CO in the fuel and then decrease beyond this fuel mixture. Moreover, the 
overlap of heat release rate distributions of reaction (R10), reaction (R284), and reaction (R99) 
in Fig. 13d imply that higher heat release density is found at reaction zone when 80% of CO 
is added in the fuel. These facts suggest that the reactions which have high heat release rate 
and CO consumption rate (R99) play an important role in affecting the heat release behavior 
and the laminar burning velocity as the CO content in the fuel is varied. Sung et al. [24] 
reported that the increase in the laminar flame speed with CO addition to n-C4H10/air flames 
results from changes in the adiabatic flame temperature (thermal effect) and from an increase 
in active radicals during combustion (chemical effect). They found that the laminar flame 
speed increases linearly with the amount of CO addition and the thermal effect on the laminar 
flame speed is more significant than the chemical effect with CO addition for rich and lean 
mixtures. They also explained that the effect of CO addition is thermal in nature which is 
based on the findings of Vagelopoulos and Egolfopoulos [25] that the added CO will not react 
until most of the hydrocarbon species have been consumed. 
 
3-5 Sensitivity Analysis 
To interpret the influence of chemical reaction effect on the flame phenomena of 
CH4/CO/air premixed flame, the first-order sensitivity coefficients of selected reactions with

Premixed Stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air Flames 
 
3-6 Adiabatic Flame Temperature 
 
For premixed stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air flames, the experimental conditions are 
shown in Table 3. The effect of H2 addition on the adiabatic flame temperatures of premixed 
stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air flames is shown in Fig. 16. The adiabatic flame temperatures 
are calculated using the STANJAN code [51]. It can be seen that the adiabatic flame 
temperature increases with increasing H2 concentration in the H2/CH4/CO fuel mixture. For a 
fixed H2 concentration the adiabatic flame temperature increases with increasing CO content 
in the CH4/CO fuel ratio and it reaches to a maximum value when CO is increased to 100%. 
However, the maximum adiabatic flame temperature does not increase significantly with 
increasing H2 concentration when the fuel is a purely stoichiometric H2/CO mixture. This fact 
suggests that at stoichiometric condition the effect of H2 addition on the adiabatic flame 
temperature is lager for the H2/CH4 flames than for the H2/CO flames. 
 
3-7 Laminar Burning Velocity 
 
The computed laminar burning velocities of the premixed stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air 
flames under various H2/CH4/CO fuel compositions are shown in Fig. 17. Note that the 
laminar burning velocity is also calculated based on the “dry” oxidation condition, i.e., no 
water vapor is present in the air. Fig. 17 shows that with 0% of H2 in the fuel mixture, the 
laminar burning velicity increases with increasing CO content in the CH4-air mixture, and it 
reaches to a maximum value (55 cm/s) at the condition of 80% of CO in fuel and decreases 
rapidly as CO is further increased. 
 When 10% of H2 is added to the fuel mixture, the laminar burning velocity is increased, 
especially for the condition of 100% of CO in the CH4/CO mixture. Note that the burning 
velocity has increased from near zero for the pure CO flame to a value of 46 cm/s for the 10% 
H2–(100% CO+0% CH4) flame. In addition, the increase of H2 content in the blended fuel not 
only increases the burning velocity, but also shifts the maximum burning velocity form that 
occurred at the condition of 10% H2–(85% CO+15% CH4) to 50% H2–(100% CO+0% CH4). 
Comparison of Figs. 16 and 17 indicates that the adiabatic flame temperature and laminar 
burning velocity are not only infuenced by the content of H2, but also by the CO 
concentration in the fuel mixture.  This fact suggests that further investigations of the flame 
and chemical kinetic structures of the premixed stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air flames are 
needed. 
 
3-8 Flame Appearance and Flame Front Position 
 
  18
measurements, due to the limitation of the R-type thermocouple (~2040 K) only the preheated 
and partial oxidation zones are measured. Fig. 20 shows that for 0% of H2 addition, four 
flames result in a similar temperature gradient, but the preheat zone for the 80% CO–20% 
CH4 flame shifts closest to the nozzle exit and leads to a slightly higher calculated flame 
temperature. When 10% and 20% of H2 are added to the fuel mixture, the preheated zone 
closest to the nozzle exit occurs at the condition of 90% CO–10% CH4 and 94% CO–6% CH4, 
respectively. The predicted flame temperatures are in good agreement with the measured data 
for all the flames measured. 
 
3-10 Chemical Kinetic Structures 
 
In order to understand the effect of H2 addition and the variation of CH4 and CO fuel 
compositions on flame characteristics, detailed flame structures for the premixed 
stoichiometric H2/CH4/CO/air flames are examined. The chemical kinetic structures of 
CH4/CO/air flames with various CO contents in fuel have been presented in previous section 
and shown in Ref. [51]. Here we only present the calculated results for 10% H2 with 10% 
CO–90% CH4, 50% CO–50% CH4, 80% CO–20% CH4, 90% CO–10% CH4, and 98% 
CO–2% CH4 in CH4/CO fuel and 20% H2 with 10% CO–90% CH4, 50% CO–50% CH4, 80% 
CO–20% CH4, 94% CO–6% CH4, and 98% CO–2% CH4 in CH4/CO fuel. The profiles of the 
temperature, species mole fraction, production rate, net reaction rate, and heat-release rate of 
the major elementary steps along the jet axis are plotted in Figs. 21−25 and 26−30 for 10% 
and 20% H2, respectively. In the figures the dashed line indicates the axial location of the 
peak temperature gradient which separates the preheat zone and the oxidation zone. It can be 
seen form Figs. 21a, 22a, 26a and 27a that when the CO concentration in fuel is low (10% and 
50%) the production of H2 and CO is primarily from the oxidation of CH4 and the H2 and CO 
oxidations start after the CH4 has been consumed to a large extent. The production of H2O is 
prior to that of CO2. As the volume fraction of CO increases to 80% in the fuel mixture (Figs. 
23a and 28a), the oxidation of H2 starts slightly earilier than that of CH4 and CO. The CH4 
mole fraction drops sharply across the maximum temperature gradient, but the CO is 
decreasing gradually due to the accompanied production of the intermediate CO from 
methane oxidation. However, the dominant chemistry of these flames, unlike the 10% and 
50% CO flames, shifts toward the CO kinetics. When the concentration of CO is increased to 
90% (Fig. 24a) and 94% (Fig. 29a), the oxidation of CH4 and CO occurs almost at the same 
time. Similar behavior is observed for the production of H2O and CO2. The CH4 chemistry 
plays only a minor role in the overall reaction as evident by the consumption rates of CH4 and 
CO (Figs. 24c and 29c). As the concentration of CO is further increased to 98%, the dry 
oxidation of CO becomes the dominant reaction in the flame. 
Computed net reaction rates indicate that with H2 addition, the reaction (R38) dominates 
the overall reaction for the CO volume fraction less than 90%. The maximum reaction rate of 
  20
for the CO content in fuel mixture up to 80%. The flame with H2 addition results in lower 
NOx emissions than that without H2 addition when the CO volume fraction is larger than 80%. 
This could be due to the effect of the change of dominant reaction steps. In general, the 
increase of H2 in fuel would increase the adiabatic flame temperature, and hence, increase the 
NOx emission. For the CO2 emission, it increases with increasing CO content in fuel mixture 
as shown in Fig. 36. The addition of H2 (up to 30%) to the fuel mixture does not reduce the 
CO2 emission. 
 
 
 
  22
production of the intermediate CO is mainly from the reactions (R284) and (R168). The 
oxidation of CO is mainly through reaction (R99) and its rate is slow until the CH4 has been 
consumed through (R98) and (R53) to a large extent. As 40% of CO is added to the fuel 
mixture, the oxidation of the additive CO does not occur during the methane oxidation stage 
in which intermediate CO is also produced. However, the rate of CO oxidation (R99) 
increases significantly and contributes to a significant amount of heat-release as compared to 
the premixed pure methane flame. As the volume fraction of CO is increased to 80% in the 
fuel mixture, the chemistry of this flame shifts toward the kinetics of the additive CO. 
Thereby, the reaction (R99) almost dominates the overall reaction rate and contributes to most 
of the positive heat-release in the preheated and oxidation zones. As the concentration of CO 
is further increased to 96%, the rate of methane dehydrogenation reactions (R98) and (R53) is 
much less than the rate of OH production reactions (R38) and (R46). The produced OH 
radicals accelerate the CO oxidation through reaction (R99) which still contributes to the 
overall heat release to this flame even though reaction (R99) is not dominant. Comparison of 
the computed laminar burning velocity, flame temperature, and CO consumption rate (R99) 
reveals that the effect of CO addition on the laminar burning velocity of the stoichiometric 
CH4/CO/air flames is due mostly to the transition of the dominant chemical kinetic steps. 
 For H2/CH4/CO/air flames, the addition of H2 to the fuel mixture not only increases the 
overall burning velocity, but also changes the characteristics of flame velocity. When 10% 
and 20% of H2 are added to the CH4/CO fuel mixture, the maximum laminar burning velocity 
occurs at 90% CO−10% CH4 and 94% CO−6% CH4, respectively. This is also confirmed by 
experimental measurements of temperature and flame front position. 
Computed chemical kinetic structures indicate that with H2 addition, the reaction (R38) 
dominates the overall reaction for the CO volume fraction less than 90%. The maximum 
reaction rate of R38 occurs at 20% H2 and 80% CO. When the CO is increased to 90% and 
higher, the reaction rate of R99 exceeds that of R38. The maximum reaction rate of R99 
appears at the condition where the maximum laminar burning velocity occurs, i.e. at 10% 
H2−90% CO−10% CH4 and 20% H2−94% CO−6% CH4. The reaction rate of R84 is always 
higher than that of R53 and R98, but its reaction location occurs later than R53 and R98 for 
CH4/CO/air flames. When H2 is added to the fuel, the reaction location of R84 shifts closer to 
that of R98. The reactions (R84) and (R98) occur at the same location when the maximum 
burning velocity also occurs. As the CO is increased to 98%, the reaction (R84) occurs before 
the reaction (R98). When 20% of H2 is added to the fuel, the reaction location of R84 is 
different from that with 10% H2 addition. The reactions (R84) and (R98) occur at the same 
location at 80% CO. As the CO is increased to 94%, the reaction (R84) occurs before the 
reaction (R98) and its rate is also higher in the preheated zone. It is noted that the addition of 
H2 increases the overall reaction rate, especially for the reactions (R38) and (R84). The major 
contributions to the positive heat release are the reactions including R10, R284, R84, R98, 
R99, R168, R101, R58, and R46. The major negative contributors are R38, R166, and R167.

一、參加會議經過 
本次第二十二屆國際爆炸與反應系統動力研討會 (International 
Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems, ICDERS)係
由白俄羅斯國家科學院 A. V. Luikov 熱與質傳研究所(A. V. Luikov Heat and 
Mass Transfer Institute of National Academy of Science of Belarus)承辦，於
2009 年 7 月 26 日至 7 月 31 日在白俄羅斯首都明斯克市的國家聯合貿易館
舉行。此會議是由設於西雅圖的爆炸與反應系統動力學會 (Institute of 
Dynamics of Explosion and Reactive Systems, IDERS)每兩年於世界各地定期
主辦，是國際上有關爆炸與燃燒反應動力系統歷史最悠久的主要國際會
議，剛好與國際燃燒會議(International Symposium on Combustion)隔年錯
開，此會議由國際燃燒學會(The International Combustion Institute)認可為偏
重於燃燒之流體動態影響方面之專家會議(A Specialist Meeting on the 
Fluid-Dynamic Aspects of Combustion)，比較著重於爆炸、爆震與燃燒動態
反應方面，與國際燃燒會議在主題強調上有明顯的區隔，所以這個會議是
爆炸、爆震、反應動力與動態燃燒反應界兩年一次重要的聚會。此次研討
會共有 231 篇相關論文發表，其中 171 篇論文以口述發表，60 篇以海報發
表，可見其規模之完整以及普受重視。 
明斯克市是白俄羅斯的首都，由於台灣沒有到明斯克的直飛班機，因此

焰結構(Flame structure)、微型燃燒器燃燒(Microscale Combustion)及數值模

以這方面場次也比較少參加。著重的方面在於應用診測技術於火焰的量
測；在微尺寸與小尺寸的燃燒現象與研究與觸媒燃燒方面也是興趣所在。
此次共發表 2 篇與成功大學航太所趙怡欽教授合作的論文，第一篇 
“Development of Chemiluminescence Sensor for Equivalence Ratio and 
Temperature Measurements in Turbulent Hydrocarbon Flames”是於 7 月 27 日
下午發表，第二篇海報論文“The Chemical Structures of Laminar Opposed-Jet 
Diffusion Flames of CH4/CO Versus Air” 於 7 月 27 日早上發表，第一篇論文
由成大航太系博士後研究員李約亨博士做口頭報告。李約亨博士從博士班
學生就參與本人與趙怡欽教授之整合型研究計畫，並曾多次出國參加國際
性學術研討會，所以表現相當平穩。除了聆聽專題演講分組發表之外，亦
參觀許許多多其他學者張貼之海報，尤其是有關應用 CARS 雷射光學技術
量測超過 10000K 高溫電漿之成果，不僅僅與張貼之作者當面討論之外，亦
留下聯絡之方式以便將來能夠做技術上面的交流。整個會議行程相當緊
湊，然而所獲得之資料與資訊卻相當的豐富。 
 
二、與會心得及建議 
有關燃燒與爆震方面的研究在各界努力經多年灌溉耕耘已漸漸開花結
果，此次我國計有 7 篇論文發表，也有 10 位學者與研究人員參加，與會之
陣容及發表論文數在大會開幕時被主辦單位提及，表示肯定，論文發表也
表現平順。成大航太系趙怡欽教授在第 20 屆會議時就被選為 Board 
member，中央大學機械系施聖洋教授於本屆亦被選為 Board member，同時
趙怡欽教授又被推舉為下一屆 2011 年在 UC Irvine 舉行時的 Program 
Chair，可見我國學者在此國際會議組織也漸嶄露頭角，大會方面也一直希
望我國可以接辦 2013 年或以後的會議，代表團不敢貿然答應，答應帶回討
論再議。近年來國科會與教育部正大力推廣的鼓勵博士班研究生出國參加
國際會議並親自發表論文以及出國參加知名教授研究的千里馬計畫，是相
當值得肯定的，對學生一生的影響不是補助的旅費所可以衡量的，但是去
年以來國科會或其他基金會去大幅減低出國補助經費，而教育部補助也納
入各學校經費由學校統籌，如此讓這些博士後研究員與博士班學生出國參
加會議申請補助處處碰壁，幾乎無法成行，還得靠自己家裡與平時積蓄始
得勉強成行，政府對這些年輕有潛力的新力軍的關注與實質補助與其在會
場上的表現幾乎不成比例，而這個現象幾乎沒有轉變的跡象，只有越來越
遭，希望在上位者對花小錢培育人才能有突破現行制度盲點的看法。此次
博士後研究員李約亨博士在學期間已有數次參加國際會議經驗，所以表現
相當平穩，而且會場內外與其他國學者也建立相當友誼。參加這次會議的

一、參加會議經過 
 
本次第三十三屆國際燃燒會議(The 33rd International Symposium on 
Combustion)係由北京清華大學承辦，於 2010 年 8 月 1 日至 8 月 6 日在清華
大學的主樓及第六教學大樓舉行。本人於 7 月 31 日早上與成功大學航太系
趙怡欽教授、副研究員陳冠邦博士及趙老師之博士後研究員李約亨、博士
生連永生、利鴻源、許耀中、張子威、碩士生伍芳嫻及高苑科技大學吳志
勇助理教授一起搭乘長榮航空公司班機啟程直飛北京首都國際機場，由於
直飛的關係，從桃園到北京只需 2 小時 40 分左右，抵達北京首都機場之後
再分批搭計程車到清華大學的「甲所」旅館辦理住宿手續，當天下午稍事
休息之後，一群人開始認識清華大學的周遭環境。北京清華大學的校園比
台灣的清大要大上好幾倍，光是從住宿旅館走到會議場館就要花 20 分鐘左
右。雖然是暑假期間，校園內人山人海，絕大部分是外來觀光客，最主要
的觀光照相景點就是立有「清華園」牌樓的第二校門，從早到晚都有人在
那取景照相，外來觀光客中有不少是帶著小孩來的，我們想應該是父母要
讓小孩瞭解，清華是大陸理工科的第一學府，也是他們未來努力的目標。
清華大學可說是大陸的重點大學中的重點，近幾年獲得的資源相當多，走
過一些大樓都可看到標示著「國家重點實驗室」的牌示，高科技園區的「中
關村」就設在清華旁邊，同時除了香港邵逸夫捐款蓋大樓之外，富士康及
寶成也都各捐了一棟非常現代化的教學或研究大樓，這一次會議的主要場
所第六教學大樓就是由寶成企業所捐獻的。

一、參加會議經過 
 
本次第三十三屆國際燃燒會議 (The 33rd International Symposium on 
Combustion)係由北京清華大學承辦，於 2010年 8月 1日至 8月 6日在清華大學
的主樓及第六教學大樓舉行。本人於 7月 31日早上與成功大學航太系趙怡欽教
授、副研究員陳冠邦博士及趙老師之博士後研究員李約亨、博士生連永生、利
鴻源、許耀中、張子威、碩士生伍芳嫻及高苑科技大學吳志勇助理教授一起搭
乘長榮航空公司班機啟程直飛北京首都國際機場，由於直飛的關係，從桃園到
北京只需 2小時 40分左右，抵達北京首都機場之後再分批搭計程車到清華大學
的「甲所」旅館辦理住宿手續，當天下午稍事休息之後，一群人開始認識清華
大學的周遭環境。北京清華大學的校園比台灣的清大要大上好幾倍，光是從住
宿旅館走到會議場館就要花 20分鐘左右。雖然是暑假期間，校園內人山人海，
絕大部分是外來觀光客，最主要的觀光照相景點就是立有「清華園」牌樓的第
二校門，從早到晚都有人在那取景照相，外來觀光客中有不少是帶著小孩來的，
我們想應該是父母要讓小孩瞭解，清華是大陸理工科的第一學府，也是他們未
來努力的目標。清華大學可說是大陸的重點大學中的重點，近幾年獲得的資源
相當多，走過一些大樓都可看到標示著「國家重點實驗室」的牌示，高科技園
區的「中關村」就設在清華旁邊，同時除了香港邵逸夫捐款蓋大樓之外，富士
康及寶成也都各捐了一棟非常現代化的教學或研究大樓，這一次會議的主要場
所第六教學大樓就是由寶成企業所捐獻的。 
此次前往北京參與會議的人員尚有中央大學機械系施聖洋教授及其一位博
士生與三位碩士生，台灣大學機械系王興華教授與潘國隆副教授及其一位碩士
生，成功大學機械系吳明勳助理教授，高雄第一科大蔡匡忠助理教授，以及虎
尾科技大學楊碩印助理教授等共 21人，陣容是歷年來最龐大的一次，值得一提
的是成功大學機械系吳明勳助理教授是此次獲得 Bernard Lewis Fellowship 
Award五位青年得獎人之一，真是與有榮焉。8月 1日上午與趙怡欽老師及其研
究生一行人一起去遊覽頤和園，下午五點到清華大學美術學院辦理報到手續之
後，並參加主辦單位所舉辦之歡迎酒會，在酒會中遇到燃燒總會前任主席普林
斯頓大學的 Prof. C. K. Law，加州大學柏克萊機械系的陳志源(J.-Y. Chen)教授，
Stanford大學的 Professor Ron Hanson，雪梨大學的 Prof. Masri，首爾國立大學的
鄭仁碩教授，從首爾國立大學轉任至沙烏地阿拉伯阿布杜拉國王科技大學擔任
潔淨燃燒研究中心主任的鄭石浩教授，加州大學爾灣分校的 Professor Derek 
Dunn-Rankin及美國 Sandia國家實驗室的 Dr. Rob Barlow與 Dr. Bill Pitz等人。 
8 月 2 日起至 8 月 6 日連續五天論文發表及海報張貼，這次會議共有 1123
多位來自 30多個不同國家的學者專家參與，大部份來自美國、日本、法國、德
國及其他歐洲國家，由於大陸是主辦國，因此參加會議的人數也不少。依據大
會 Technical Program主席南加大機械系 Prof. Paul Ronney的報告，本次會議投
稿共 1051篇，接受發表 439篇，可刊載在 Proceeding的約 370幾篇，可見論文
審查之嚴謹度。

由本人與成大航太所趙怡欽老師及其博士後研究員、研究生共同發表之論文
被安排在最後一天(8月 6日)下午以口頭報告方式進行，題目是 Development of a 
tubular-flame combustor for thermophotovoltaic power systems，由博士生利鴻源進
行報告，因利同學曾在去年的國際爆炸與反應系統動力會議做過口頭報告，口
語表達與臨場反應皆比去年進步許多。由於國際燃燒會議兩年出版一次的論文
集(Proceedings of the Combustion Institute) Impact Factor非常高，2007年的 Impact 
Factor為 2.647，2008年為 1.906，2009年 Impact Factor為 3.256，此 Impact Factor
高於燃燒著名期刊 Combustion and Flame之 Impact Factor，由此可見國際燃燒會
議所出版之論文集的重要性。 
 
二、 與會心得 
 
有關燃燒方面的研究在各界努力經多年灌溉耕耘已漸漸開花結果，此次我國
計有 7篇論文被接受發表，也有 21位學者與研究生參加，與會之陣容及發表論
文數可說是本人自 1994年參加國際燃燒會議以來之最，論文發表也表現平順。
近年來國科會與教育部正大力推廣的鼓勵博士班研究生出國參加國際會議並親
自發表論文，是相當值得肯定的，對學生一生的影響不是補助的旅費所可以衡
量的，但是去年以來國科會或其他基金會去大幅減低出國補助經費，而教育部
補助也納入各學校經費由學校統籌，如此讓這些博士後研究員與博士班學生出
國參加會議申請補助處處碰壁，幾乎無法成行，還得靠自己家裡與平時積蓄始
得勉強成行，政府對這些年輕有潛力的新力軍的關注與實質補助與其在會場上
的表現幾乎不成比例，而這個現象幾乎沒有轉變的跡象，只有越來越遭，希望
在上位者對花小錢培育人才能有突破現行制度盲點的看法。此次博士後研究員
李約亨博士在學期間已有數次參加國際會議經驗，所以表現相當平穩，而且會
場內外與其他國學者也建立相當友誼。參加這次會議的博士生中，成大航太系
有利鴻源及張子威兩位上台報告，張子威是第一次以英文作口頭報告，國內博
士生第一次用英文演講難免緊張，現場問答會有些支拙，但讓學生於國際會議
場合加以磨練，熟悉論文發表程序以及方法，增進其經驗，培養其獨立思考的
能力，這是在課堂上無法傳授的經驗，這是培養一位從事研究的專家不可或缺
的經驗，所以個人認為應該在經費補助與管道上多多鼓勵學生參加國際性研討
