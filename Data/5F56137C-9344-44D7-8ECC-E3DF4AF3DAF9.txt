two envelopes. Two purposes of the sifting process are: (1)
to eliminate riding waves; and (2) to make the wave-profiles
more symmetrical [6].
As shown in Fig. 2, the wave h1 is still asymmetric and
it needs to be treated as the data and then take the the sifting
process until h1k is IMF. This IMF h1k is then designated as
the first IMF component of the data. The stopping criteria are
provided in [7], [9]. The shortest period content of the data
should be contained in c1. Separating c1 from the rest of the
data, we have the residue r1. By repeating the sifting process
on r1 and all the following rjs, the EMD of the HHT get
X(t) =
n∑

ci + rn. (1)
Then a decomposition of the input data into n IMFs and one
residue is achieved. The detail of the decomposition process is
presented in [6]. Let us examine the linear sum of three cosine

for the asymmetric wave form. The three IMF components
after applying the EMD are shown in Fig. 4.

By applying the Hilbert transform to the IMFs which sifted
from the EMD of HHT, the instantaneous frequency of each
component can be computed. That the amplitude and the in-
stantaneous frequency are functions of time enable us to rep-
resent the data in a three-dimensional plot designated as the
Hilbert spectrum [6]. Considering an isolated sine wave and
treat it by the Hilbert spectral analysis. From the Hilbert spec-
trum as in Fig. 5, the energy of the calibration signal is highly
localized in both time and frequency domains.
III EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION AND
SIGNAL DETECTION
Hilbert-Huang transform is a new method for analyzing non-
stationary signal [6]. Any input data can be decomposed into a
small number of intrinsic mode functions by using the empir-
ical mode decomposition (EMD). From the Hilbert transform
of the IMF, the instantaneous frequencies of the signal can be
given. Finally, the input data is presented by the Hilbert spec-
trum in an energy-frequency-time distribution. Because the
Hilbert transform can make the data analytical, it can provide

IV EMPIRICAL MODEL AND COMPUTER
ANALYSIS
The authors of [2] suggested the usage of density estimates
[12] to establish the initial density estimate of noise and then
to detect the signal. The performance of the proposed EMD-
based detector is compared to the DWT-based method by using
the ROC curves in the following experiment. The empirical
mode decomposition (EMD) is first applied to an initial sam-
ple (32, 768 data points) taken from a sound recording con-
sisting of pure background noise without signals of interest.
The intrinsic mode functions (IMF’s) c1, c2, c3 decomposed
by the EMD are summarized in terms of three mean sums of
squares. Each one has 256 time windows. Density estimation
of the joint distribution of these summaries is used to obtain
an adaptive noise model of the background continuum and to
choose a threshold value η.
For every threshold value η, with the experiment repeated
256 times, the PD and the PF for that particular threshold value
can be evaluated. This experiment is run for several values of
the threshold value η, and the ROC of the EMD-based detector
by representing the PD as a function of the PF can be obtained
and is plotted in Fig. 6. A comparison of the ROC between the
EMD-based detector and the DWT-based method illustrated in
Fig. 6 shows that the proposed method is better than the DWT-
based detector if the PF is lower than 0.83.
V CONCLUSION
The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is introduced to
the problem of signal detection in underwater sound. Based on
the EMD, any input data can be decomposed into a small num-
ber of intrinsic mode functions (IMF’s) which can serve as the
basis of non-stationary data for they are complete, almost or-
thogonal, local and adaptive. Based on the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC), it shows that this proposed EMD-based
detector is better than the DWT-based method.
