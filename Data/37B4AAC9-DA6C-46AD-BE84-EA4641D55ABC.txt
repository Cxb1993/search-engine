assembly line using an automatic conveyor 
system. During the first step of SMA, solder 
paste is deposited onto the PCB pads via 
stencil printing. Air pressure then is applied 
to a squeegee, forcing the solder paste roll to 
the front of the squeegee blade. The high 
pressure squeezes the solder paste into the 
stencil aperture, and the squeegee travels 
across the surface of the stencil, after which 
leaving paste on the PCB pads, after the 
release of the stencil. Next, the surface mount 
components (SMCs) are picked and placed 
on the pasted pads using chip shooters. 
Finally, the solder paste is reflowed and 
solder joints are established through reflow 
furnace. 
Stencil printing exhibits nonlinear 
characteristics owing to the nature of the 
process and unavoidable random variations. 
Industry reports indicate that approximately 
50~70% of soldering defects are attributed to 
the paste stencil printing process [4][16], 
following which the defect rate suddenly 
reduces for succeeding process segments. 
The stencil printing process possesses 
multiple responses and performance 
characteristics. The desired paste deposit 
volume (quantitative response) and the 
occurrence of printing defects (such as bridge, 
slump, and scoop) determine stencil printing 
performance [7], which is influenced by 
numerous variables, including stencil design, 
stencil printer, solder paste selection, product 
configuration, and parameter settings [6]. 
The deposit volume can be measured with an 
AOI (Automatic optics inspection) system, 
and printing quality is identified based on the 
subjective judgment of human-inspectors 
using the AVI (Automatic visual inspection) 
system. 
The stencil printer is a crucial tool for 
transferring solder paste onto PCB accurately, 
consistently and repetitively. Solder paste is 
the major medium used for connecting SMCs 
with the PCB pads. The rheological property 
of solder paste influences printing pattern 
consistency, tack and slump performance 
[1][13]. The rheology of solder paste can be 
attributed to particle size, particle distribution, 
and changing viscosity during the printing 
stage. The correct choice of solder paste type 
and its ingredients can improve printability, 
solderability, and solder joint reliability [2]. 
Owczarek and Howland [14][15] observed a 
strong relationship between snap-off height 
and paste deposit volume. Lotfi and Howarth 
[9] stated that squeegee pressure, and 
squeegee speed are essential for enhancing 
printing performance. Nevertheless, conflicts 
exist among several researches. For example, 
Mannan et al. [10] and Pan [17] reported that 
aperture design significantly influences the 
ability to achieve appropriate paste volume. 
However, Whitmore et al. [20] revealed that 
paste deposit volume is not related to stencil 
thickness. Mannan et al. [10] found that the 
paste deposit height is proportional to 
printing speed; but Pan et al. [16] reported 
that the squeegee speed does not significantly 
affect solder paste deposit volume. Indeed, 
the nonlinear nature of the printing process 
and the relevant cause and effect relationship 
remain only partially understood. 
Building on the literature reviews 
[2][11][13][14][15] and the domain 
knowledge obtained by experienced 
engineers, this work extensively considered 
the possible significant input factors 
 4
complications and the use of special 
instruments that make it difficult for 
process practitioners to apply these 
methods reliably. 
● SMA is automated in high-speed 
production. Investigating or monitoring 
quantitative response alone makes it 
difficult to obtain the optimum process 
parameters, and moreover it may be 
impossible to evaluate the relationships 
between the key process factors and 
multi-characteristic (qualitative and 
quantitative) quality performance. 
● Recently, the AOI and AVI systems 
have become popular for on-line stencil 
printing control. Generally, these 
inspection systems possess a high-speed 
brick measurement mechanism and the 
pattern recognition can partially detect 
printing defects. However, these 
systems are inadequate for detecting 
qualitative printing defects. Generally, 
human inspectors are subjectively 
involved in identifying printing defects 
using AVI system, rather than using 
AOI system.

optimization 
A data set was obtained from a 3k-p 
fractional factorial experimental design 
containing multiple responses. Because the 
printing quality (qualitative response) is 
identified subjectively by human-inspectors, 
and thus involves some degree of fuzziness, 
the FQLF concept is used to evaluate the 
qualitative response of stencil printing. This 
work performed data cleaning to remove the 
outliers and thus provide a more accurate 
data source prior to conducting the 
optimization tasks. The optimization process 
is three-fold. First, the QP algorithm was 
applied to formulate the nonlinear 
cause-and-effect relationships of the stencil 
printing process by learning from the 
cleaned data, followed by GA searching for 
the optimal sets of process parameters 
(solution #1). Second, this study combined 
multiple performance characteristics to 
create a single desirability value before 
conducting another cycle of neural network 
training and GA search process (solution #2) 
and for RSM optimization (solution #3).

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) 
was designed by Saaty [18], and is an 
intuitive multi-criteria decision-making 
method that can solve complex and 
subjective decision-making problems in 
uncertain environments. The stencil printing 
involves three types of printing modes with 
respect to component pitches (0.40 mm, 
 6
snap-off height (1 mm), squeegee speed (36 
mm/sec), squeegee pressure (2.5 bars), 
solder paste viscosity (1,280 kcps), and 
solder paste particle size (type III). The 
responses include average paste thickness 
(8.7 mils), average paste volume (9,650 mil3) 
measured using an AOI system, and the last 
three fields indicate printing defect 
significance, for example, “5” (category I of 
qualitative response) indicates that a serious 
printing defect occurs for the lead-pitch 0.4 
mm package, “1” represents that no defect 
occurs for the 0.5 mm instance, and so on, 
as subjectively identified by human 
inspectors using an AVI system. 
The combinational parameter settings 
listed in Table. 5, were used to evaluate the 
optimization performance of the two subject 
approaches via DPMO analysis using a 
historical SPC database. The DPMO value 
is defined in Eqn. (9).

In the DPMO measuring process, the 
number of opportunities (denominator) can 
be calculated based on the bill of material 
(BOM) and the CAD system used at 
company V. This study took 30 samples for 
various individual modes from the SPC 
database and used them to empirically 
evaluate the proposed models. The average 
DPMO value of the stencil printing process 
segment for mass production was 17,143 
(around 3.6 sigma) when there were 7,010 
defect opportunities. Table. 6 lists the 
evaluation result for the three models and 
the regular mass production. The first 
optimization method is superior to the 
others, DPMO of 5,952 (4.0 sigma). Indeed, 
the performance of the first intelligent 
approach shows promising result to have 
empirical implementation further for 
improving the stencil printing quality.

四、計畫成果與自評 
SMT has become the most important 
method in the electronic assembly industry. 
Complex and nonlinear behavior in the 
stencil printing process segment can cause 
significant soldering defect problems, and 
thus induce significant quality and 
production time losses. Particularly, 
approximately 60% of soldering defects 
originate from stencil printing process 
segment. The stencil printing process must 
be optimized to improve quality level and 
reduce manufacturing costs of surface 
mount assembly systems. This work made
