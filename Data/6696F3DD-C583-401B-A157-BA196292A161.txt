Introduction	
In this project, we propose to build a Frequency Domain Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy 
(FD-DRS) system that can deduce the optical properties of superficial tissues. In order to recover 
the optical properties of turbid samples using the FD-DRS system, a photon transport model is 
required that accurately relates s’ and a to the measured reflectance.  In this report, we will show 
a new measurement geometry that enables the use of a very efficient photon transport model for 
recovering the optical properties of samples. Part of the results has been published on the Optics 
Letters in November 2010. In addition, we have completed a one-wavelength FD-DRS system that 
is capable of performing continuous laser intensity modulation scan from 10 to 500MHz. We will 
report the stability of the current system and describe our plan for expanding the system to a 
multi-wavelength system. 
Literature	Review	
Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) has been successfully applied to study the absorption (a) 
and the reduced scattering coefficients ('s) of various biological tissues, which can be translated 
into parameters that are relevant to the function of tissues.[1] DRS has to work with a proper photon 
transport model, such as the Standard Diffusion Equation (SDE), to recover the optical properties of 
samples. In the regime where the so called “diffusion approximation” is satisfied, i.e. high 's to a 
ratio and photon travelling length longer than [10/(a+'s)], the SDE is very accurate.[2] Therefore, 
the DRS techniques that work with the SDE are usually applied to study thick tissues, such as breast, 
at large source-detector separations.[1] To investigate superficial tissue volumes using DRS, many 
researchers have developed alternative photon transport models that can precisely determine the 
light radiance near the light source. For example, Liu and Ramanujam employed a scaling Monte 
Carlo (MC) method to recover the properties of superficial tissues with layered-structure within 
minutes.[3] 
Unfortunately more than 80% of all cancers originate from epithelial tissues [4].  Therefore, 
there is considerable motivation for developing a method which enables DRS systems to recover 
optical properties of epithelial tissues accurately, efficiently, and noninvasively.  Previously, we 
proposed a new DRS probe design (called diffusing probe), which enables the diffusion equation 
working at source-detector separations shorter than [5/(a+'s)].[5] The proposed geometry uses a 
high scattering slab to diffuse the source light and ensures that all detected photons have travelled 
through the sample. We have shown that the diffusing probe has average interrogation depths 
shallower than 800m and have utilized it to determine the optical properties of human skin 
in-vivo.[5]

Following Kienle’s derivation, the source term of the DPPS geometry can be effectively 
modeled with a planar source located in first layer at a distance z0=1/(a1+'s1) beneath the 
air-sample boundary, and the three-layer frequency-domain diffusion equations are given by:

reflectance is obtained from the integral of the radiance L2=(1/4)[23(d2/dz)cos /D2] in the 
second layer at the boundary over the backward hemisphere as R=(1/4)∫2L2cosd. 
 
1B. Monte Carlo Simulation 
The MC code employed here was extended from the one developed by Wang et al.[8] In this study, 
unless otherwise noted, the following parameters were used in the simulations: the optical 
properties of the 0.5 mm thick high scattering layer and the 108 mm semi-infinite sample were

the APD and the RF signal is sent to the network analyzer to determine the phase delay and 
amplitude demodulation introduced by the sample under investigation. This system can be 
controlled through a graphical user interface (GUI) program developed using LabVIEW 8.5 
(National Instruments). The GUI program also allows users to save the measurement data in the 
laptop for further data processing. 
Results	and	Discussion	
1. diffusing probe with planar source (DPPS) geometry 
 
In this study, the frequency domain reflectance was generated from 0 to 1500 MHz using the 
diffusion model and its accuracy was benchmarked using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. As 
illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the agreement between the reflectance generated using the DPPSDM (dot 
lines) and the MC model (triangles) is excellent, and the deviations for the amplitude demodulation 
and phase delay are less than 0.07% and 0.36%, respectively.

In the simulation, the radii of the high scattering layer and the source were both 10 cm. Since a real 
DPPS probe would have finite lateral size as illustrated in Fig. 1(b), it is essential to study the effect 
of the probe lateral dimension on the reflectance. We recorded the incident positions of all 20,000 
detected photon packets in the MC simulation and calculated the detected photon packet number 
versus the incident radial position. The detected photon packet number originating form a certain 
radial position was normalized with respect to the total amount of captured photon packets as 
shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(b) also includes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the 
normalized detected photon packet number. It can be seen in Fig. 3(b), the normalized detected 
photon packet number decreases as the incident radial position increases. The radii for the CDF to

Determining and monitoring the depth of the skin melanoma invasion is crucial for 
prognosis. We employed the DPPSDM to fit the tumor MC data discussed above and calculated the 
thickness of the homogeneous, infinitely wide top sample layer in the DPPSDM. In the DPPSDM, 
the optical properties of the top and the bottom of the sample layer were kept constant at a1=0.5 or 
0.15/mm, 's1=3/mm and a2=0.03/mm, 's2=3/mm, respectively. The thickness of the top sample 
layer was the parameter to be determined. As shown in Fig. 4(b), when the tumor radius is larger 
than 0.25mm, the fit top sample layer thickness increases with the radius of tumor for either top 
layer absorption settings. We have tested many top layer setting combinations that have a higher 
than 0.03/mm and arbitrary 's, and found the same trend as mentioned above. Although the current 
forward model does not allow us to determine the exact diameter of tumor, our preliminary 
simulation results suggest that the DPPS could be an effective and efficient tool to monitor the 
vertical progression of melanotic lesions in-vivo and could facilitate the prognosis of skin 
melanoma. Further MC simulations are necessary to investigate the correlation between the 
invasion of the tumor with realistic shapes and the recovered top sample layer thickness. 
 
2. Performance of the FD-DRS System 
 
The one-wavelength FD-DRS system stability was evaluated by measuring a homemade silicone 
phantom. The optical probe was pressed gently against the phantom surface to measure the diffuse 
reflectance of the phantom. The detected reflectance was converted to a RF signal, typically 
between -80 and -83 dbm, by the APD. It was observed that the instrument phase and amplitude 
response was stable. The differences between two consecutive scans in amplitude and phase are
