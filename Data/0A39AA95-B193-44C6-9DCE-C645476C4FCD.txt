the (conventional flow) theory of plasticity gather together such diverse forms of expres-
sions as the yield condition, plastic-flow rule, loading-unloading criteria, elastic-plastic
decomposition, hardening-softening law. Then internal variables are created for descrip-
tion of elastoplastic behavior.
In this report, we consider a general form of elastoplastic model as follows:
q =
∂W c(Q,qp,λ,β,θ)
∂Q
+ qp, (1)

qp = a(Q,qp,λ,β, θ)λ˙, (2)

β = b(Q,qp,λ,β,θ)λ˙, (3)
f(Q,qp,λ,β,θ) ≤ 0, (4)
λ˙ ≥ 0, (5)
fT λ˙ = 0. (6)
Here Q = (Q1, Q2, · · · , Qn)T , q = (q1, q2, · · · , qn)T , and qp = (qp1, qp2, · · · , qpn)T de-
note the n-vectors of generalized stress, generalized strain, and generalized plastic strain,
respectively. The superscript T denotes transpose. The vector β consists of nβ internal
variables. In general nβ 6= n. The scalarW c is the complementary stored energy. An over-
dot marks rate, namely derivative with respect to ordering, not necessarily physical, time
t. The vector θ denotes the model parameters with nθ components. All Q,q,q
p,β, f ,λ
are functions of time. The matrix-valued functions a and b specify the plastic flow and the
internal variable flow, respectively. The vectors f and λ each have N components. The
complementary trios (4) furnish the model with 2N alternative phases. In this model, all
variables except for Q, q and θ are internal variables introduced to describe the internal
states of elastoplasticity.
It is an usual way to formulate identification problems of model parameters in this
complicated model as an optimization problem in which the cost functional serves to mea-
sure the deviation between experimental data and estimated data. Due to the complexity
of elastoplasticity, these optimization problems can not be linear problems. Yoshida et
al. [56][57] used an optimization method proposed by Toropov et al. [50] to deal with
the identification of material parameters in a constitutive model for sheet metals. Zhao
and Lee [61] applied a gradient method to estimate material parameters of a constitutive
model for sheet metals. Johansson et al. [22] combined a gradient-free method and a gra-
dient based method to identify the parameters of a model for large multi-axial ratcheting
strains. Mahnken and Stein [34][35][36][41] addressed the identification of material param-
eters based on experimental data, which represent nonuniform distributions of stresses and

Dynamic programming
In this section, we review the theory of dynamic programming and manage to derive
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation rigorously. Consider the optimization problem
inf
u(·)∈U [ti,tf )
J [u] (9)
subject to x˙ = f(t,x(t),u(t)),
x(ti) = xi,
(10)
in which the cost functional,
J [u] :=
∫ tf
ti
L(τ,x(τ),u(τ))dτ + S(tf ,xf ),
is defined over the function space U [t,tf ), the set of all maps from [t, tf ) to the control
space U . Since the state x and the control u are varying over the time interval [ti, tf ], the
problem (9, 10) is a dynamic optimization problem.
In order to transform the dynamic optimization problem (9, 10) into a set of static
optimization problems, we define a new optimal problem as follows:
inf
u(·)∈U [t,tf )
J [u](t,x) (11)
subject to x˙ = f(t,x(t),u(t)),
(12)
in which the cost-to-go
J [u](t,x) :=
∫ tf
t
L(τ,x(τ),u(τ))dτ + S(tf ,xf )
is a functional of the control function u and is also a function of time t and state x. If
t = ti and x = xi, the problem (11, 12) turns out to be identical with the problem (9, 10).
4
According to Lemma 1, there exists an optimal u such that the optimal cost-to-go
possesses the following property.
Lemma 2. For an optimal u for an initial point (t,x),
J(t,x) =
∫ ta
t
L(τ,x(τ),u(τ))dτ + J(ta, φ(t, ta,x,u)). (17)
Proof. Let u be the concatentation of w and v; i.e.,
u(τ) =
{
w(τ) τ ∈ [t, ta),
v(τ) τ ∈ [ta, tf ).
The cost-to-go is
J [u](t,x) =
∫ ta
t
L(τ,x(τ),w(τ))dτ + J [v](ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)).
Since u is optimal, the optimal cost-to-go is thus
J(t,x) =
∫ ta
t
L(τ,x(τ),w(τ))dτ + J [v](ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)).
If v is not optimal for (ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)), there exists a v′ such that
J [v](ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)) > J [v
′](ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)),
and another u′ such that
J [u′](t,x) =
∫ ta
t
L(τ,x(τ),w(τ))dτ + J [v′](ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)),
where
u′(τ) =
{
w(τ) τ ∈ [t, ta),
v′(τ) τ ∈ [ta, tf ).
Then we obtain
J [u′](t,x) ≤ J [u](t,x).
This contradicts the statement of the optimal u. Hence, the control v must be optimal for an
initial point (ta, φ(t, ta,x,w)).
Combining Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we obtain a significant property as follows.
6
Theorem 1. LetW (t,x) satisfy Eq.(20) and the terminal conditionW (tf ,xf ) = S(tf ,xf ). Then
W (t,x) ≤ V (t,x),∀(t ∈ [ti, tf ],x ∈ X ). (21)
Moreover, if there exists an admissible control w such that
L(t, ξ(t),w(t)) +
∂W
∂x
(t, ξ(t)) · f(t, ξ(t),w(t))
= inf
u(t)
{
L(t, ξ(t),u(t)) +
∂W
∂x
(t, ξ(t)) · f(t, ξ(t),u(t))
}
(22)
for almost all t ∈ [ti, tf ], in which ξ(t) denotes the solution of Eq.(10) with u(t) = w(t), then
w(t) is the optimal control andW (t,x) = V (t,x).
Proof. To prove Eq.(21), we begin with
W (tf ,xf ) = W (t,x) +
∫ tf
t
d
dτ
W (τ, τ)dτ
= W (t,x) +
∫ tf
t
∂W
∂x
(t,x(t)) · f(t, ξ(t),u(t)) + ∂W
∂t
(t,x(t))dτ.
Since W (t,x) satisfies Eq.(20) and the terminal condition, the above equation can be rewritten
as follows:
S(tf ,xf ) ≥ W (t,x)−
∫ tf
t
L(τ,x(τ),u(τ))dτ.
By the definition of J [u](t,x), we obtain
J [u](t,x) ≥ W (t,x).
By taking the infimum over u, we get Eq.(21).
Then we prove the second assertion of the theorem. Let an admissible control w satisfy
Eq.(21) and repeat the above derivation with w, yielding
J [w](t,x) = W (t,x). (23)
On the basis of Eqs.(21) and (23), we have proved thatw is optimal andW (t,x) = V (t,x).
Dynamic programming in identification of elastoplastic model

On the basis of the theory of mathematical programming, the KKT conditions (Krash-
Kuhn-Tucker) or so-called Kuhn-Tucker conditions [33] can be derived as follows:

Heretofore, we have derived the necessary conditions of the optimization problem
(26). Now, we will prove Lemma 4 through Lemma 8 and show that the condition (27) is
the necessary and sufficient condition.
Lemma 4. The set S1 := {a ∈ RN |a ≥ 0} is convex.
Proof.
∵ a1, a2 ∈ S1, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, b = γa1 + (1− γ)a2 ⇒ b ∈ S1
∴ S1 is a convex set.
Lemma 5. The set S2 := {a ∈ RN |fTa = 0} is convex.
Proof.
∃a1, a2 ∈ S2, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, b = γa1 + (1− γ)a2
∵ fTb = fT [γa1 + (1− γ)a2] = γfTa1 + (1− γ)fTa2 = 0⇒ b ∈ S2
∴ S2 is a convex set.
Lemma 6. The set S := {a ∈ RN |a ≥ 0, fTa = 0} is convex
Proof.
∵ S1 and S2 are convex sets, S = S1 ∩ S2
∴ S is a convex set.

The symbol ∂10H denotes the partial differential with respect to the tenth argument of
the function H.
We have determined the optimal control function of the problem (24). When we pull
time t back to the initial time ti, the optimal cost-to-go of problem (24) is identical to the
cost of problem (7) with optimal control function; i.e.
J(ti,q

Hence, the optimal solution qpi ,βi,λi,θi of problem (7) must satisty the following condi-
tions

On the basis of the thoery of partial differential equations [23], the firsr-order partial
differential equation can be reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations that is
called characteristic system. Therefore, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (29) can be reduced
12
Eq.(33) and Eq.(30), and they can be shown as follows:
Pq(ti) = 0,
Pβ(ti) = 0,
Pλ(ti) = 0,
Pθ(ti) = 0, (35)
Pq(tf ) = 0,
Pβ(tf ) = 0,
Pλ(tf ) = 0,
Pθ(tf ) = 0,
J(tf ) = 0.
Variational method in identification of elastoplastic model
Alternatively, let us consider the optimization problem (7), introducing an augmented
cost as shown below,
Jˆ [qp,β,λ,θ,Pq,Pβ,Pλ,Pθ,u]
:=
∫ tf

where Pq, Pβ, Pλ and Pθ are Lagrange multipliers. Then, the solution of optimization
problem (7) must satisfy following conditions
δJˆ [q,β,λ,θ,Pq,Pβ,Pλ,Pθ,u] = 0,

and the boundary conditions,
Pq(ti) = 0,
Pβ(ti) = 0,
Pλ(ti) = 0,
Pθ(ti) = 0,
Pq(tf ) = 0,
Pβ(tf ) = 0,
Pλ(tf ) = 0,
Pθ(tf ) = 0,
J(tf ) = 0.
Obivously, the ordinary differential equations and boundary conditions mentioned above
are identical to the characteristic system (Eq.(34)) and its boundary conditions (Eq.(35)),
respectively in the last section.
Treatment of complementary trios
In the preceding sections, we have converted an optimization problem (7) into a
problem of finding the solution to a system of ordinary differential equations with algebraic
equations and algebraic inequalities. In this section, we try to derive a algebraic equation
which is equivalent to the complementary trios. Then, we derived a system of ordinary
differential equations only with algebraic equations.
The complementary trios,
f ≤ 0, λ˙ ≥ 0, fT λ˙ = 0,
can be written as component form,
fj ≤ 0, λ˙j ≥ 0,∀j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N},
∑
k fkλ˙k = 0.
In fact, it is equivalent to the N -fold complementary trious
fj ≤ 0, λ˙j ≥ 0, fjλ˙j = 0, ∀j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N}. (39)
We introduce the positive constants cjλ and c
j
f with reciprocal dimensions such that c
j
λλ˙j
and cjffj are nondimensionalized and rewritten Eq.(39) as follows:
cjffj ≤ 0, cjλλ˙j ≥ 0, cjλλ˙jcjffj = 0, ∀j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N}. (40)
16
and discretize it as follews:
M−1∑
i=1
[
H(ti,x(ti),p(ti),α(ti),u(ti))− pT∇dx)
]
∆t,
where ∇d denotes discrete time operator. Then, we derive discrete time optimization
problem
min
x(t1),x(t2),··· ,p(t1),p(t2),··· ,
α(t1),α(t2),··· ,u(t1),u(t2),···
M−1∑
i=1
[
H(ti,x(ti),p(ti),α(ti),u(ti))− pT∇dx)
]
∆t. (44)
For example, if we choose the forward difference operator as discrete time operator
∇dx(ti) = x(t
i+1)− x(ti)
∆t
, (45)
and
x(t) = x(ti),p(t) = p(ti+1),α(t) = α(ti),u(t) = u(ti), t ∈ (ti, ti+1), (46)
the discrete time optimization problem can be written as follows:
min
x(t1),x(t2),··· ,p(t1),p(t2),··· ,
α(t1),α(t2),··· ,u(t1),u(t2),··· ,
M−1∑
i=1
[
H(ti,x(ti),p(ti+1),α(ti),u(ti))∆t− pT (ti+1)∇dx(ti)∆t
]
(47)
where
H(ti,x(ti),p(ti+1),α(ti),u(ti)) = L(t,x(ti),u(ti))+pT (ti+1)h(t, x(t),u(ti))+αT (ti)g(t,x(ti),u(ti)).
According to mathematical programming, the solution of optimization problem (47) must
satisfy
D3H(t
i,x(ti),p(ti+1), λ˙(ti),α(ti))−∇dx(ti) = 0,
D2H(t
i,x(ti),p(ti+1), λ˙(ti),α(ti)) +∇dp(ti) = 0,
D4H(t
i,x(ti),p(ti+1), λ˙(ti),α(ti)) = 0, i = 2, , · · · ,M − 2, (48)
D5H(t
i,x(ti),p(ti+1), λ˙(ti),α(ti)) = 0,
pT (tM) = 0,
pT (t1) = 0.
This discrete system can be recognized as a discrete-time version of Eq.(38).
18
Alternatively we used the variational method to derive the conditions of solution for
the identification problem (7). They are identical with those derived by using dynamic
programming. We also discretized the unconstrained cost and formulated a discrete-time
optimization problem. Using a suitable scheme, we obtained the discrete conditions of
solution which were proved to preserve the symplectic structure.

Chompoorat, T, 來自泰國朱拉隆功大學。此篇論文致力於討論瀝青混泥土的力學模
型，文中提到了兩種模型：viscoplastic 模式與 hyperplastic 模式。很明顯地，兩者
同在廣義塑性模式範疇。 
  另外，在論文 Nonlinear Analysis of Ultra High Strength Concrete RC Structures, 論
文 Effect of Material Inelastic Characteristics on Ultimate Behavior of Hybrid 
Composite Girder 與論文 Characterization of Skyhook Control in terms of Equivalent 
Negative Stiffness Control 也都與塑性理論密切有關。 
    實際上，與會的文章中，只要與力學行為實驗、理論與應用有關，都可以看到
塑性理論的蹤跡，不論其用何種偽裝（guise）出現，本質上都隸屬於塑性理論的研
究領域。 
    由以上可知，為了因應不同層面的需求，塑性模式一定會發展的越來越複雜，
而其中模式的參數與模式的演化內變數也會變的越來越多。對於如何去決定模式參
數與如何去估測演化內變數歷時，在本計劃之研究中已有不錯方法，經由此次會議， 
發表研究成果並與國際學者相互交流。 
    在本次會議中，本計畫 (NSC 95-2221-E-002-412 動態規劃分析識別彈塑性研究)
之主持人洪宏基教授擔任會議第二天結構部份第 12 節的會議主持人，此節共有 6
篇文章發表。而參與本計劃之博士生劉立偉也在此節發表此計劃研究成果之論文
(Optimization methods for parameter identification of elastoplastici models [見附件])，並和
與會學者相互討論。藉由國科會的支持，博士生得以在國際會議發表論文，並在與
會期間和各國學者相會交流討論。此舉對於開拓博士生的視野與增進其國際化有很
大的幫助。 
   最後感謝國科會提供參與此次國際學術研討會的經費。

 basis of Eqs.(2) and (3), we know that the internal variables Pq  and β  are governed by differential equations, and evolve 
with time. Notice that in addition there is an implicit differential equation of λ , namely λλ 
dt
d
. It is known that for any 
solvable differential equation, there must be initial conditions specified correspondingly. Hence, the importance of initial 
conditions of internal variables is not at all less than the importance of model parameters in an identification problem in 
elastoplasticity, so that we address in this paper identification not only of material parameters but also of the initial values of 
internal variables. 
According to the elastoplastic model (1)-(4), we cast the identification problems of this model as follows:
