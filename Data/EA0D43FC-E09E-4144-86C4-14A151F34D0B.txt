Abstract 
 
We have developed a general approach for the determination of equation of state parameters 
from first principle solvation calculations. The consequence of this is a completely predictive 
approach for almost any thermodynamic properties of all types of fluids (pure and mixture) at all 
conditions (above and below the critical point) without the need of any experimental data. We 
have shown that this model can be used to predict the pure fluid properties such as the vapor 
pressure, liquid density, the critical temperature and pressure, as well as the vapor-liquid and 
liquid-liquid phase equilibria of mixture fluids. This method also allows for accurate predictions 
of the distribution of a trace amount of pollutant between two partially miscible liquids, such as 
the octanol-water partition coefficient. The method developed here does not suffer from the 
problem of missing parameters that is commonly seen in the group contribution method and 
applicable to many more problems than the quantitative structure-activity relationship for 
property estimation. The accuracy of property predictions from our method is comparable or 
superior to most existing methods. We have demonstrated the powerfulness of this approach in 
the 5th Industrial Fluid Simulation Challenge (http://fluidproperties.org/) in 2008 where our 
research team won the championship from the 4 international participants for the most 
accurate prediction of the octanol-water partition coefficients and infinite-dilution activity 
coefficients of selected chemicals.

chemical species and their mixtures and, thus, is useful when only some or even no experimental 
data are available.

2.1 EOS parameters from the solvation free energy. The solvation free energy G*sol is 
the work needed for transferring a solute molecule i from ideal gas to a solution (S) under 
constant temperature T and pressure P. Considering the solution to be a pseudo-pure fluid, the 
free energy change can be obtained from the compressibility z(=PV/RT) of the solution as36

In the athermal condition (i.e., T approaches infinity), the solvation free energy is mainly a result 
of hard-core repulsions among the molecules in solution and can be considered as the work for 
creating a cavity volume with the size and shape of the solute in the solvent. Thus, it is referred 
to as the hard-core cavity formation free energy (hccav)

vapor pressure data using selected compounds. 
 Once the charging free energy at some give temperature and solution composition is 
determined from eqs 8 to 19, the energetic parameter a(T,x) in the PR EOS can be calculated 
from eq 6. This approach is referred to as PR+COSMOSAC hereafter. 
 2.3 Improvements when some experimental data of pure substances are available. 
While the PR+COSMOSAC approach allows for the description of PVTx relations of mixture 
fluids without input of experimental data, it is possible to increase its level of accuracy in the 
calculation of mixture properties by incorporating experimental data of pure substances, such as 
the vapor pressure or the critical properties. The method of inclusion of experimental data 
depends on the type of data available. Two methods will be introduced: the 
PR+COSMOSAC+Pvap method when the vapor pressures are available, and the 
PR+COSMOSAC+TcPc method when the critical properties and acentric factor are available. 
If the vapor pressures of pure components are available, they are used to correct for any 
error in the charging free energy calculation of pure species

correct pressures in the VLE phase diagram in the pure fluid limits. However, it is not applicable 
for problems such as solubility of a gas in liquid because the system temperature is higher than 
the critical temperature of the gas (and no vapor pressure data is available).  
 When the critical properties (Tc and Pc) and acentric factor () are available, they can be 
used to correct the charging free energy as follows

In the PR+COSMOSAC method, the first step is to perform quantum mechanical (QM) 
COSMO solvation calculations37, 47 and obtain necessary information for calculations of chgSiG
*
/ . 
(Note that a very large database of the COSMO calculation results maintained by Liu’s group48 at 
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (denoted as VT database49) is freely 
available to the public and can be used here to replace the time consuming COSMO calculations). 
Once the QM data are available, the components of the charging free energy are determined for a 
given temperature T and solution composition x. The detailed procedure of these calculations has 
been published elsewhere32, 33. 
To determine the vapor pressure of a pure fluid the charging free energy of a species in its 
pure liquid is determined from eq 9 (i.e, )9  eq(*/
chg
iiG  with the solvent S being pure liquid i or, 
equivalently, x=xi=1). This value is then used in eq 6 for the calculation of the energetic 
parameter ai. The vapor pressure can then be determined following the standard procedure (see 
for example Ref50). The critical volume is related to the volume parameter b (which is 
approximated to be the cavity volume of molecular solvation and can be obtained from the 
COSMO calculation) as32

The critical temperature can be obtained from solving the following equation32

normal boiling temperature are 0.37 (or 48% in Pvap) and 21.4%, respectively. Except for carbon 
monoxide, whose error in lnPvap is 6.77, predicted results for all the other compounds are 
acceptable. 
 
Figure 1. Predicted vapor pressure at normal boiling point for 1295 compounds. The solid 
line presents 1 atm. The marked species are nitrogen tetroxide (A) and ammonia (B). 
 
Figure 2 shows the comparison of experimental and predicted critical properties for 
compounds whose experimental critical properties are available in the DIPPR database (348, 433, 
and 272 compounds in critical pressure (Pc), critical temperature (Tc), and critical volume (Vc), 
respectively). The overall average absolute relative errors (AARD) are 9.96% (0.4 MPa), 4.13% 
(22.13 K), and 5.34% (0.02 m3/kmol) in Pc, Tc, and Vc, respectively. The critical volume is 
estimated from the volume of solvation cavity in COSMO calculation. The predicted Vc are in 
excellent agreement with experiment for small compounds (e.g., Vc < 0.6 m3/kmol). The larger 
deviations (underestimation) found for larger compounds could be attributed to the ignorance of 
conformation flexibility in current calculations (e.g., long chain alkanes are modeled as linear but 
they could be folded in reality) and/or the ignorance of molecular shape effects in the PR EOS 
(the cavity term in PR EOS is valid for spherical molecules51). The deviations in Tc are less than 
120 K, except for carbon monoxide and methacrylic acid, marked by C and D, respectively, in 
Figure 2a. The critical pressure can be obtained from eq 26 once Vc and Tc are known. While the 
PR EOS has a fixed value of zc(= 0.307) for all compounds, experimental values of zc ranges 
from 0.2 to 0.3 for most chemicals.1, 46 Therefore, we have rescaled the calculated Pc by 
0.26/0.307 in Figure 2b for better accuracy. The poorly predicted Pc found in Figure 2b (marked 
A,B,E,F,G,H) are caused either by the constant critical compressibility factor (zc=PcVc/RTc) in PR 
EOS or the error in the predicted Tc. For example, hydrogen fluoride (marked G) has zc=0.117 
and ammonia (marked B) has zc=0.242 but has a deviation of 114 K in predicted Tc.

4.2 The vapor-liquid phase equilibrium of binary mixtures. The overall absolute average 
errors from the proposed PR+COSMOSAC method are 27.56% (AARD) in pressure and 5.18% 
(AAD) in vapor phase composition (Table 2). The errors reduce significantly to 6.24% and 
2.25% if the vapor pressures of pure components are used (PR+COSMOSAC+Pvap), and to 
6.75% and 2.34% if critical properties and acentric factor of pure components are used 
(PR+COSMOSAC+TcPc). Figure 3 shows the P-x-y diagram for 
2-methylpentane/3-methyl-2-butanol binary mixtures. In this system the pure component vapor 
pressures are well predicted by PR+COSMOSAC and the predicted results from all three 
methods are almost identical. (Note that results from PR+COSMOSAC, 
PR+COSMOSAC+TcPc, and PR+COSMOSAC+Pvap are shown in dotted, dashed, and solid 
lines, respectively.) Figure 4 shows the P-x-y diagram for 1-hexene/ethyl acetate at three 
temperatures. At 313.15 K, the vapor pressures are well predicted from PR+COSMOSAC and 
the three methods behaves similarly. As the temperature increases, in which case the deviations 
in vapor pressure increases, larger deviations are observed in the mixture VLE as well. When the 
needed experimental data for PR+COSMOSAC+TcPc and PR+COSMOSAC+Pvap are available, 
these two methods reliably improves the accuracy in VLE regardless the mixture is ideal (e.g., 
Figure 5) or highly non-ideal (e.g., Figures 3, 4, and 6). Therefore, while the completely 
predictive PR+COSMOSAC approach provides the general shape of VLE phase diagram, its 
accuracy in describing mixture VLE is limited by its capability of predicting pure component 
vapor pressures.

The applicability of the proposed method to high pressure systems is illustrated with 
2-propanol/water binary mixtures in Figure 7. While the PR+COSMSAC method provide 
qualitative agreement with experiment, the inclusion pure component properties 
(PR+COSMOSAC+TcPc and PR+COSMOSAC+Pvap) significantly improves the accuracy in 
predicted phase boundaries. Also note that the PR+COSMOSAC+Pvap is applicable only at 
temperatures below Tc of 2-propanol (~508 K), and both PR+COSMOSAC and 
PR+COSMOSAC+TcPc are applicable at all temperatures.

in places where existing methods become inadequate. For example, the accuracy of methods 
based on proper use of results from quantum mechanical calculations remains roughly the same 
if used for new chemical species. However, because of the proximity effects, methods based on 
concept of group contributions (e.g., PSRK) may fail badly if used for compounds that do not 
belong to the family of compounds used in the parameterization. Therefore while existing 
methods may be more accurate when they are applicable, the proposed method can serve as a 
valuable complementary approach to existing methods when they are not applicable.

Paper II: Thermodynamics and Transport Properties (01A06) 
Determination of Cubic Equation of State Parameters for Pure and Mixture Fluids from 
First Principle Solvation Calculations

A new method for estimating the cubic of equation of state parameters for both pure and mixture 
fluids without using critical properties is proposed. In this method, the solvation charging free 
energy and the solvation cavity are used to determine the temperature-dependent energy 
parameter a(T) and volume parameter b. This method requires only element specific parameters 
(3 parameters for each element, including one atomic radius and two parameters for describing 
dispersion interactions), and 10 universal parameters for electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding 
interactions. The equation of state (EOS) parameters so determined allow for the description of 
the complete phase diagram, including the critical point, for pure and mixture fluids. We have 
examined this method using the Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS1 for 1295 compounds and 141 binary 
mixture systems. For pure compounds, this model achieved an accuracy of 48% in vapor 
pressure at normal boiling point, 21.4% in liquid density, 4.1% in critical temperature, 10% in 
critical pressure, and 5.3% in critical volume. For binary mixture systems, the overall average 
deviation in total pressure and vapor phase composition are 28.5% and 5.5%, respectively. The 
errors can be reduced significantly (to 6.8% and 2.5%) if the critical properties and acentric 
factor of the pure components are used. This method is, in principle, applicable to any chemical 
species and is especially useful for those whose experimental data are not available.

Abstract 
 
We have used atomistic molecular dynamic simulations to study isothermal crystallization of 
poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) at various temperatures and various degree of external stresses. While 
extensive experimental and theoretical efforts are made to verify and explain the molecular mechanism in the 
growth of nuclei in polymeric materials, the primary stage of polymer crystallization is less well understood. 
Our atomistic reveal the formation and growth of highly oriented but loosely packed clusters (nucleus 
precursors) upon quenching a melted semi-rigid polymer. This work we force on the stress-induced 
crystallization phenomena which happened on the industrial process of the fiber spinning. While such a 
process has been used to increase crystallinity of polymer fibers since 1950s, the molecular motion of the 
polymer and the mechanism of the crystallization are still unclear.  
Our simulations show that the structural order of polymer is affected both by the drawing speed and the 
crystallization temperature. At all temperature, oriented structure can be created, and the size of oriented 
domain increases upon drawing. Beyond about a strain of 300% large voids and highly oriented structures 
are observed. Furthermore, the size of the oriented domains decreases with the drawing speeds. The amount 
of the oriented structure is a function of temperature at lower drawing speed (3.2 m/s). However, temperature 
effects are less prominent at high drawing speeds (> 32 m/s). Detailed analysis also performed on the two 
feature torsions (Φ1 COCC and Φ2 OCCC) in the PTT backbone (O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O). It is found that the 
trans-to-gauche ratio in Φ1 increases rapidly (from 3 to 6) at lower drawing speed and higher temperatures; 
however, the increase is less significant at high drawing speed and low temperatures. In contrast, the trans-
to-gauche ratio for Φ2 seems to be insensitive to processing conditions (varies from 0.6 to 1.3 regardless of 
drawing speeds). Before drawing, the most populated conformations in the backbone torsions are t-t-t-t (Φ1-
Φ2-Φ2-Φ1) and/or t-g-g-t. During draw process, the t-t-t-t conformation increases. Our results are in 
agreement with some experimental observations, and disagree with others.
