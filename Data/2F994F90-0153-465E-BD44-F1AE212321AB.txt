approach where weighting is made according to the stochastic behavior of the observational 
errors, the theories of MINQUE (MInimum Norm Quadratic Estimation) (Rao 1971)) and 
BIQUE (Best Invariant Quadratic Unbiased Estimation) (Koch 1988, Schaffrin 1983, 
LaMotte 1973) are considered as the two best estimators for the weight determinations. The 
minimum variance condition in BIQUE, which is based upon the normality assumption of the 
observations, is indeed the minimum norm condition in MINQUE. Thus, BIQUE is equivalent 
to MINQUE. The only difference is that the normality is not assumed in MINQUE. In 
addition to the MINQUE and BIQUE, the IAUE (Iterated Almost Unbiased Estimation) 
(Lucas 1985a) is an even simpler approach when it comes to estimating merely variance 
components. The working formula of the IAUE technique is also seen in Förstner (1979a) and 
Schaffrin (1983).  
Because of its computational advantage, the IAUE was particularly proposed as a means 
for the final adjustment of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988(Lucas 1985b). When 
the IAUE is used, group redundancy plays an important role in the convergence of an 
individual variance. Förstner (1979b) inferred that the smaller the redundancy number a group 
has, the slower the corresponding variance converges. The work in (Hsu, 1999) shows that 
sometimes IAUE is unable to produce variance estimates satisfactorily due to inappropriate 
grouping schemes, that variances tend to get estimates for groups with large redundancy, and 
that for those variances which fail to converge the group redundancy numbers decrease 
monotonically to nearly zero as the iteration proceeds.  
The determinations of weights by the techniques mentioned above are easy and simple when there

In the equation above, ),,2,1( kimi L=  denote the variance and covariance components, and 
,k)1,2,(i L=iC  are known symmetric matrices. 
   In the theory of BIQUE, a linear function pTm is to be estimated by a quadratic  LTML. In the 
function, p is a known k-vector and m a k-vector with components mi as shown in Eq(2). In the 
quadratic, M is a symmetric matrix that is to be found by imposing LTML to fulfill some conditions. 
The properties that LTML has are invariance, unbiasedness, and minimum variance. In order to apply 
the existing BIQUE to the model as expressed by Eq(1), we rewrite it in the following form

makes the entries ijS  and iq in equations (26) and (27) different from their counterparts in 
the BIQUE without systematic parameters. The use of (28) relies mainly on matrix K, which 
is obtainable from the least-squares adjustment, provided that LS  is approximately known 
beforehand. Like the BIQUE without systematic parameters, the estimates obtained from 
Eq(28) are likely biased because the estimates of individual components depend upon their 
initial approximations and the solution has to go through an iteration procedure. In particular, 
some of the estimates may fail to converge to certain values if there are too many components 
to be determined. Such failures stem from too small group redundancy associated with these 
observation groups (Hsu 1999). In addition, nonsingular matrix S is not guarantied in the 
derivation of Eq(28). In some cases, one has to look to finding the pseudo inverse of S matrix. 
3. IAUE model 
   BIQUE is an adequate tool for estimating variance and covariance components. However, there is 
an even simpler approach when it comes to estimating merely variance components. IAUE (Lucas 
1985a) is intended for such a purpose. IAUE, a variation of BIQUE in essence, focuses on obtaining 
estimations for variance factors. After the variance factors have been satisfactorily estimated, the 
corresponding variance components are computed. 
   Let im
~  be the initial estimate of im . The true variance im  can be related to the initial estimate 
by an unknown variance factor if  such that

redundancy number of an observation in the absence of systematic parameters. In response to the 
grouping structure of matrix LS  as given by Eq(30), the R matrix has following form

where n  is the number of sections within a line, il  is the section length in kilometers, and id  the 
section discrepancy in millimeters.  
In addition to the conventional weighting model and the constant correlation model, the new IAUE 
estimator, namely Eq.(43), will be applied to the Taiwan’s leveling network in this section.  
4-1 Weight estimation by IAUE 
   Instead of modeling the leveling errors for the Taiwan network by IAUE as was done by Chen et. 
al (1990), three variances, each associated with the terrain the leveling lines covered, were estimated. 
For the Taiwan network, the instruments used and field procedures employed were the same for all 
lines. The precisions of individual lines were found highly correlated with the terrains the leveling 
covered. As a result, a simple grouping was made according to the terrain. The 26 leveling lines were 
classified into three groups as shown in Table 2. Group 1 consisted of lines leveled over flat terrains 
while group 3 pertained to lines though mountainous areas and group 2 was somewhat undulating with 
regard to terrain features.  
   By ordering the section discrepancies of the individual lines according to their ordinal numbers 
within each line during the leveling procedure, the lag-one autocorrelation coefficients were then 
 14 
the inference “if systematic effects are eliminated as nearly as possible, then the remaining errors can 
be expected to be very small and slightly dependent in such a way that all correlations will be small 
and positive.” (Hsu, 1996)  
4-2 Weighting by the constant correlation model  
   According to the error model of constant correlation (Hsu 1996), the weight of an observed height 
difference is given by

where S is the leveled line length in kilometers, a = m2 )1( g- , b 2m lg= » g2m  with g  being the 
correlation among section discrepancies within a line, m2 and l  being the variance of 1 km and the 
section length (assuming l  is 1 km for simplicity) within that line, respectively. For the Taiwan 
network application, g  was estimated by lag-one autocorrelation and m2 was computed according to 
the formula  given in Eq.(44). For those leveling lines having lag-one autocorrelations smaller than 0.2, 
the systematic effects remained were considered negligible and the correlations, g , were set equal to 
zeros in Eq.(45).  
   The systematic parameter vector Y must be excluded in the formation of the observation equation 
when the constant correlation model is to be used. Obviously, weighting according to Eq.(45) has the 
advantage that the degree of freedom of the network is larger comparing to weighting schemes by the 
IAUE and the conventional model (Both take systematic parameters into consideration). The fourth 
column, labeled (C), of Table 4 shows the estimated elevations, their standard deviations, and the 
mean network precision due to the constant correlation model. 
 16 
parameters were included in their formation of the observation equations, in particular have rather 
large differences in elevations, ranging from approximately 3mm to 7mm.  
5. Conclusions  
   By the same minor modification to the BIQUE and IAUE without systematic parameters, the 
BIQUE and IAUE with systematic parameters have been derived. For both cases -- with and without 
systematic parameters, the working formulas, BIQUE or IAUE, posses the same form mathematically. 
Nevertheless, the inclusion of systematic paramete rs leads the adjustment system a smaller degree of 
freedom, and thereby lowering the precisions of all estimated unknowns, comparing to the system 
without systematic parameters. It is therefore strongly recommended that the statistical testing on the 
systematic parameters be always performed so as to insure a correct inclusion of systematic 
parameters into the adjustment computation and hence produce the proper estimates for all the 
parameters of the adjustment system and their precisions.  
   The experiment made in the Taiwan leveling network seems to indicate that negative correlations 
are not to be considered when it comes to forming systematic parameters for the functional model of 
an adjustment system. On account of the system’s redundancy and hence the precisions, the constant 
correlation model provided the best weighting scheme for the Taiwan leveling network. However, it 
was selected not merely based on the precisions it generates but also on the computational advantages 
it has. The t-statistic testing is not necessary when using the constant correlation model. In principle, a 
correct weighting model should be molded based upon the stochastic behavior of the observational 
errors and it does not necessarily generate a higher precisions. Furthermore, it should be independent 
of the network configuration, i.e. the design matrix. These are indeed the weighting philosophy that
