基礎流體內布朗運動提昇熱傳，因此熱傳導係數會變大，
從圖5可看出熱對流發生的時間更提早，線性段的範圍較短
且斜率也較大，此時線性段範圍為7.4到20.1秒之間，以時

Abstract 
The thermal conductivity of nano ferrofluid is obviously 
higher than the base fluid. The possible enhancement could be 
from the Brownian motion or the deposition of nano particles 
on the hot wire surface which increased the heat transfer area. 
This means the transient hot wire method is used. The effects 
of nano particle concentration and external magnetic field were 
investigated. Also the surface of hot wire was examined 
closely by the SEM. The results show that the thermal 
conductivity of nano ferrofluid is increasing at the higher 
volume concentration. When the concentration is 7% the 
thermal conductivity is almost twice of the base fluid. The 
induced magnetic field when current flew through the hot wire 
has no effect of the deposition of nano particles on wire surface. 
Because the SEM images tell that there were no particle 
deposited on the hot wire surface. When the external magnetic 
field, which was perpendicular to the axis of hot wire, was 
applied, the thermal conductivity of ferrofluid was decreased. 
Under the action of 351 Gauss magnetic field, the thermal 
conductivity of 7% concentration fluid decreased 27%. But

enhancements in industrial equipments found that the thermal conductivities of copper oxide and titanium 
dioxide nanofluids were unusual bigger. Because of the high thermal conductivity of nanofluids, the power 
needed to pump the fluids decreased dramatically. This was the first time "nanofluid" terminology appeared to 
describe the fluid with suspension of nano particles. Eastman et al. [4] found that when a small amount of 
copper nanoparticles were added to ethylene glycol, the thermal conductivity could increase about 40%. 
Keblinski et al. [5] tried to analyze why the thermal conductivity of nanofluid could increase so much. They 
proposed the main reasons were due to Brownian motion, liquid layering at liquid/particle interface, nature of 
heat transport in nanoparticles, and effects of nanoparticles clustering. Liuet al. [6] synthesized the circular 
copper nanoparticles which was dispersed in ethanol, and used the transient hot wire method to measure the 
thermal conductivity of the fluid. They found that increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles could 
improve the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid dramatically. In 2005 Xuan et al. [7] measured the transport 
properties of magnetic fluids by transient hot wire method and capillary viscosity meter. They found that 5 
vol% water based ferro nanofluid increased the thermal conductivity about 15%. Also they applied the 
external magnetic field to the measurement system and concluded that if the external magnetic field was 
perpendicular to temperature gradient of hot wire, the thermal conductivity had no obvious change. But if the 
external magnetic field was parallel to temperature gradient the thermal conductivity increased about 25%. 
They tried to explain the increase was due to the nano particles clustering by external magnetic field. But this 
explanation could not explain the thermal conductivity difference between parallel and perpendicular 
magnetic fields. Further if the Brownian motion was the main factor of high thermal conductivity of ferro 
nanofluid, the external magnetic field will reduce the thermal conductivity , not increasing. So the conclusions 
need further verify. In 2009 Kostic and Simham [8] designed an apparatus which was very suitable to the 
measurement of liquid thermal conductivity. They explained the theory of transient hot wire method and 
surveyed some parameters which could affect the accuracy of measurements like diameter of  pt wire, 
resistance of Wheatstone Bridge, the balance of circuit and tension of wire by supports. Also they described 
some important processes during measurement.

THEORY 
In 2010 Das et al. [9] reviewed the thermal conductivity measurement methods used in study of nanofluids. 
Based on their survey, there were near 70% of researches chose transient hot wire method. The theory was 
completely proposed by Kestin et al. [10] in 1976. As previous discussion Kostic et al. described the detail 
processes and applied them to measure the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. For an infinite long wire 
immersed in homogeneous medium, the radial coordinate governing equation for transient heat conduction is

Where R1, R2, and R3 are resistances which the values had been known. Rw is the resistance of hot wire. Once

            Figure 2: A typical Wheatstone Bridge circuit arrangement. 
 
The experimental set-up was shown as figure 3. Since RW represents the resistance of the platinum hot wire 
and the value is very sensitive to temperature, so R2 in figure 2 had been replaced by an adjustable resistance. 
Such that the balance of the circuit will be easily finished when the initial temperature of ferro nanofluid was 
changed. In order to control the initial temperature of ferro nanofluid, the box contained fluid and hot wire 
was immersed in water bath with temperature control system. Because the temperature effect on thermal 
conductivity is one of important parameters, such that the balance process needs to repeatedly operate. After 
the initial temperature of ferro nanofluid reached stable state, then applied a small supply voltage VS and 
adjusted the adjustable resistance until the VG was zero again. In order not to disturb the initial temperature 
during balance process, the supply voltage should be as lower as possible. Otherwise the hot wire could 
release too much heat and affected the initial temperature. In this study, during the balanced process, only 
0.1V was applied.

Temperature effects on water thermal conductivity 
  In order to understand the stability and accuracy of measurement system when the initial temperature 
changed, the water thermal conductivities were measured at temperatures from 15℃ to 45℃. Also the 
calculated values were compared with reference values. In figure 6 one can easily find the set-up has good 
accuracy. One important reason is that the distilled water is not electrical conductor. Otherwise to coat an 
insulator layer on the platinum hot wire surface is necessary. But the heat conducted from wire to fluid would 
affect by the coated material which the accuracy will reduce. During the calculation of linear slope the time 
interval needed to be specified. The first point started from 1.3)ln( =t  which the real time was 22.2 seconds 
for all the measurements. But the second point ended at different points. When the temperature was at 15℃ 
the second point ended at 75.3)ln( =t  which the real time was 42.6 seconds. But when the temperature 
changed to 25, 35, and 45℃, the second points were 42, 40.3, and 36.9 seconds respectively. It is reasonable 
because the thermal conductivity of water is increased when the temperature is increased also. A higher 
thermal conductivity could conduct more heat from wire surface to fluid at same temperature gradient and 
cause the natural convection happened earlier. Such that the second point of linear slope time interval went a 
little bite forward. The maximum error was still within 1%.

Nano particle volume fraction effects on ferro nanofluid thermal conductivity  
  Oil based ferro nanofluid has wide applications in industrial engineering such as damping variable shock 
absorber and bearing lubrication fluid in vacuum system. So we synthesized the oil based ferro nanofluid with 
diesel oil as the base fluid. The thermal conductivity of diesel oil needed to be measured first. Figure 7 shown 
the unbalance voltage evolution curve. The temperature still kept at 25℃. Since the thermal conductivity of 
diesel is smaller than the one of water, the heat flux from hot wire to fluid is reduced. Such that the 
temperature rise of hot wire had to be quick and the unbalance voltages were bigger. This phenomenon can be 
found between figure 5 and 7. The linear slope real time interval was from 12.2 to 33.2 seconds. The 
calculated thermal conductivity was 0.23 W/m℃. Ferro nano particle volume fractions of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7%

         Figure 8: The volume fraction effects on the thermal conductivity 
 
External magnetic field effects on thermal conductivity 
   If the Brownian motion was mainly responsible for the heat transfer enhancement of ferro nanofluid, there 
was one question needed further verification. Was there any independent parameter to control the Brownian 
motion? One solution was to control the viscosity of ferro nanofluids to be the same for different nano particle 
volume fractions. The related discussions can be referred to Chen et al. [13]. The other solution was to apply 
external magnetic field during the measurements. The applied external magnetic field should constrain the 
motion of ferro nano particles. The Brownian motion was slow down and the heat transfer enhancement 
reduced.  Since the saturation magnetization [7] of ferro nanofluid is about 421 Gauss(G), the applied 
external magnetic field (at central position of box) in this study were set to 48, 147, and 341 G. All the 
strength of magnetic field was measured by Gauss meter model 915 manufactured by Magnetic 
Instrumentation Inc. The direction of magnetic field was perpendicular to the hot wire axis, which was the 
same direction as temperature gradient of the fluid. The results were shown as figure 9. For any nano particle 
volume fraction when the external magnetic fields were applied all the thermal conductivities were smaller 
than those without any magnetic field. For example, the thermal conductivity of 1 vol% without magnetic 
field was 0.305 W/m℃, when the strength of magnetic field increased from 48 to 341G, the thermal 
conductivity decreased from 0.3 to 0.29 W/m℃. Obviously, the Brownian motion of nano particles were 
depressed. The conditions were even worse at the 7 vol% state. The thermal conductivity dropped from 0.488 
to 0.352 W/m℃ which meant more nano particles were constrained by the external magnetic field the help to 
transfer energy by colliding was depressed. However, compared to based fluid the thermal conductivity under 
external magnetic field still increased about 53%. Just as described in previous section, the more nano 
particles added the higher thermal conductivity of ferro nanofluid. If took a close look for the 48G condition, 
the thermal conductivity changes were not so smooth. It was supposed that the applied external magnetic field 
was not very uniform. Especially when the applied magnetic field was not so strong, more nano particles 
would stay at weaker magnetic field for the high volume fraction case. And then we had tried to applied the 
external magnetic field along the axis of hot wire. For the central position magnetic field strength to be 22.8G 
case, the strength at some regions of box would exceed the saturation magnetization strength. Because the 
geometry limitation caused the magnetic field strength gradient along the hot wire axis would be very large. 
Even it was hard to form higher magnetic field strength at the middle position. For parallel case the 
measurements revealed no significant effects on the thermal conductivity.  But the issues of increasing 
magnetic field strength at central position for the parallel case and keeping magnetic field uniform are main 
tasks in future researches.
