21. INTRODICTION
The concept of ordered weighted averaging (OWA) was introduced by Yager1 in 1988 as
a method for aggregating information in the problem of multicriteria decision making
(MCDM). It is defined based on product and addition, two operations that do not apply to
(finite) ordinal scales. Later on, in Ref. 2, the concept of ordinal OWA operators was
introduced based on max and min operations. To overcome the operation limitation for ordinal
OWA, on the one hand, researchers had developed various tools to define different versions of
ordinal OWA. For examples, based on so called smooth t-conorm, Godo and Torra3 defined
ordered weighted means on (finite) ordinal scales related to integer weights—their results
were generalized by Calvo and Mesiar4, and, based on (translational) 2-tuple representation,
Herrera and Martínez5 defined OWA aggregation of linguistic (ordinal) information such that
the aggregated result is not represented by a single ordinal but by an ordinal 2-tuple—their
results were generalized by Wang and Hao6, among others. On the other hand, considering the
median operator as the ordinal counterpart of the arithmetic mean, researchers had developed
weighted median7, median-based8 and median-like9 aggregation to replace the role of OWA as
a mean operator with compensation in the ordinal contexts.
In this article we address to the topic on the aggregation of weighted ordinal information.
The departure of our development is the quantile operation. It is well-known that the usual
4and the p-quantile, let us note here that the usual quantile operation Q possesses the strong
idempotency property12 but, as will be seen in Section 2, p-quantile operation does not. The
lack of the strong idempotency makes the weighted p-quantile aggregation become
complicative, while it puts the search of the identity elements (IDs) of various p-quantiles (e.g.
the ones with rational floating position indices) at ease and hence stimulates the study of
finding suitable importance transformations to handle the p-quantile aggregation of weighted
ordinal information. Our study extends the results of Yager7 on weighted median aggregation.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we study p-quantile
aggregation of real scores with quantative importance. Section 3 introduces weighted
p-quantile aggregation on finite ordinal scales in which ordinal information may be weighted
with quantative or qualitative importance. Then, in Section 4, we define a new version of
ordinal OWA operator for aggregating ordinal information with qualitative importance and
apply it to MCDM problems. In Section 5 we present our conclusions.

3. WEIGHTED P-QUANTILE AGGREGATION ON FINITE ORDINAL SCALES
We will extend the notion of p-quantile aggregation to work under finite ordinal scales
contexts in this section. For weighted p-quantile aggregation on finite ordinal scales, both the
cases with importance degree measured in quantitive and qualitative scales are considered. In
case that the importance degree measured in quantitive scales, we will mimic the
corresponding techniques for real scales in Section 2 to serve for finite ordinal scales, while
when the importance degree is measured in qualitative scales, new techniques based on the
transformation of qualitative weighted ordinal information will be introduced.
3.1 P-Quantile Aggregation on Finite Ordinal Scales
Let },,,{ 10 gsssS  with gsss  10 be an (ordered) ordinal set of granuality
1g . Denote nS the set of all bags with n elements drawn from S . In the following,
12
aggregation of ordinal inputs (see Definition 6 below).
A motivation of the notion of (general) proportional 2-tuple may be found in Ref. 6. Here,
a brief explanation is as follows. A general proportional 2-tuple )8.0,2.0( ji ss , ji , may be
viewed as an “ordinal”that is between is and js such that if we use the index i (resp.
index j ) as an “anchoring value”of is (resp. js ), then the general ordinal 2-tuple
)8.0,2.0( ji ss may be interpreted as the “ordinal”whose anchoring value is ji 8.02.0  .
Note that jijjjiijii  )(2.08.02.0)(8.0 .
Step further, for convenience, in the following, an order relation  is built on gS
based on the position indices of general ordinal proportional 2-tuples.
Definition 4. Let S and gS be as in Definition 3. Define ],0[: gS g  by
jiss ji )1())1(,(   for each gji Sss  ))1(,(  .
)( y is called the position index of y , gSy , and )( is called the position index
function on gS . (To emphasize its domain, the position index function on gS will also be
denoted as S if necessary.)
Thus, the comparison of ordinal information represented by general proportional 2-tuples
can be carried out according to their relative locations. More precisely, for any gSyy 21 , ,
define 21 yy  if )()( 21 yy   . Now, we are ready to discuss p-quantile operators on


 n
n
S
N
. To start with, we rephrase the definition of an aggregation operator14 under ordinal
14
scales with normalized position index p .
Note that Definition 6 is a straight mimic of Definition 1 by replacing real inputs (resp.
real output) with ordinal inputs (resp. ordinal proportional 2-tuple output). It is easy to see
that each pQuanO , 10 p , is an aggregation operator in the sense of Definition 5.
Furthermore, other properties like the ones in Proposition 1 may be rephrased under (finite)
ordinal contexts as follows.
Proposition 3. pQuanO , 10 p , satisfies the following properties:
a. Symmetry: The aggregation pQuanO is indifferent to the ordering of the
arguments;
b. Monotonicity: For any two bags  nyyy ,,, 21  and  nn Syyy ',,',' 21  ,

3.2. P-Quantile Aggregation of Ordinal Information with Quantative Importance
In this subsection, using a formula similar to the one in Proposition 2, we define the
operators *pQuanO , 10 p , which are aggregation operators with (quantative)
importances associated with pQuanO in the sense of Ref. 9.

--this means that for elements with equal quantative importances, *pQuanO
reduces to the p-quantile aggregation operator pQuanO .
The proof of Proposition 4 is similar to Proposition 2 which we omit it.
Definition 7. The aggregation operator *pQuanO with 10 p in Proposition 4 will
be called an associated weighted (aggregation) operator of pQuanO with importance
degree measured in quantative scales.
3.3. P-Quantile Aggregation of Ordinal Information with Qualitative Importance
3.3.1. Importance Transformation and Weighted Aggregation
Yager7 introduced an alternative approach to aggregate ordinal information with
qualitative importance based on the notion of importance transformation. In the following, we
try to extend the techniques used in Ref. 7 to work under p-quantile aggregation contexts. To
this aim, we first modify the notion of identity element7 to suit for more general contexts.

Medg , the weighted median MedgMed is defined by

where  is the addition operation of bags.
Recall that for Medg , the four conditions of Definition 9 were checked
7 as follows.
Condition (1) is true because of the monotonicity of the triangular normed operators.
Condition (3) is true by Proposition 5 and condition (4) holds by using the strong
idempotency property12 of Med . Especially, condition (2) was claimed being essentially
satisfied by the fact that yu is monotonically nonincreasing as u increases and yu is
monotonically nondecreasing as u increases; in other words, the lower the importance, the
more spread apart the yu and yu making them less likely to effect the median selection.
22

Next, if we define 2MedG with the same formula as

MedG but replace

2
2P , then
2
MedG is also a Med-based importance transformation on SW and therefore, the
corresponding 2MedG -based weighted median 2
MedG
Med can be constructed in a similar ways
as 1

criteria required is specified in terms of a linguistic quantifier such as most.
In this section, based on the notion of floating position index, we first define a new
version of ordinal OWA operator, called a floating position index-based OWA (P-OWA)
operator. Then we provide an example to illustrate its application.
4.1. Floating Position Index-Based OWA Operators

In Ref. 6, the OWA operator was extended to deal with linguistic proportional 2-tuples,
which is based on a CCV function on L , is defined as follows. Let },,,{ 10 mlllL  (with

Note that, using the operator in Definition 12 as the aggregation operator in an MCDM
problem, )( iN c denotes the degree of satisfaction we attain if we satisfy any i of the
criteria in the MCDM problem. It is a nondecreasing function of i . Furthermore,
)()( 1 iNiN cc  is the increase in satisfaction we get in going from satisfying 1i to i
criteria.
There are many ways16 to determine the weighting vector for an OWA operation. In the
following, we focus on the case that the OWA weighting vectors are determined via linguistic
quantifiers, especially the regular increasing monotone (RIM) quantifier15, which can provide
information aggregation procedures guided by verbally expressed concepts and a dimension

Note that, based on the above approximation formula, if there are many bags (with large
and various amount of elements) needed to be aggregated by QOWAP operation, we may
use the same p-quantile operation QuanO with )(Qorness to do the job easily and
less costly. See the example in the next subsection for more information.
4.2 Example
To enlarge the scope of business, an entertainment enterprise plans to build a new picture
theater somewhere. There are several options for its location city. Suppose that there are four
cities—Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung, under consideration. The final decision
depends on many criteria. One of the most important criteria is the business potential for
different cities. To get useful (and objective) evaluation on the criterion of the business
potential, the managing director asks one of the company’s analysts to conduct a marketing
survey for the issue. The analyst designs a questionnaire to collect the consumers’opinions.
Although the analyst wants to use the majority opinion as the overall opinion of the
corresponding cities’consumers, but experience tells him/her that the consuming intendancy

operator of the data in kY , by Definition 10, we need to select an  pQuanO based
importance transformation (based on a suitable pair of t-norm  and t-conorm ) to
transform a bag of data drawn from  nSW )( into a bag belonging to nS . For the
example, we choose 5

characteristics as discussed below.
First, the proposed approach handles the p-quantile aggregation of weighted ordinal
information with real (quantative) and finite ordinal (qualitative) weights in the same
spirit—by using the same notion of floating position index.
Second, the proposed approach handles the p-quantile aggregation of ordinal information
with qualitative importance in the same pattern as in the well-known7 weighted Min, Max and
Med—through the notion of importance transformation.
Third, the role of the notion of floating position index in the P-OWA operators is
intrinsically the same as the role of the notion of attitudinal character1, 19 (orness) in OWA
operators. Using P-OWA operators as the decision function of weighted ordinal information in
an MEDM problem is convenient than using OWA operators—not only since it is
computationally simple but also since it is practically available when the amount of weighted
ordinal information is large and varied for different alternatives.
Besides, we think that P-OWA operators may play prominent role in other decision
making environments. Here we mention two directions: decision making under uncertainty19
and the optimizer’s curse20. For the former, Yager19 had proposed a fuzzy modeling approach
for the construction of decision functions for intelligent decision making under uncertainty
which allow for the inclusion of information about the decision maker’s attitude and
