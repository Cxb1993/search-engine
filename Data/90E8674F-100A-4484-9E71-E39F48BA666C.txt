Biologists have known that the gene regulatory network of yeast is robust against mutations and the

effects of mutations. However, robustness is only a qualitative concept for most biologists, it is informative to 
have a quantitative robustness measure for gene regulatory networks.

Robustness is the invariance of phenotypes in the face of perturbation [1,2]. It is a ubiquitous property of 
biological systems and has been found to be present in living organisms at all levels of organizational 
complexity ranging from the signal molecular level such as RNA secondary structure [3] and protein structure 
[4] to the level of genome-scale networks such as gene regulatory networks [5,6,7], biochemical networks [8,9] 
and metabolic networks [10,11]. To better understand robustness is of paramount importance for 
understanding organismal evolution [12,13]. 
Several gene regulatory networks have been represented by mathematical models and shown to be robust to 
parameter variations. von Dassow et al. [5] modeled the Drosophila segment polarity network using 
differential equations and showed that this network is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that 
govern its behavior. Eldar et al. [6] modeled the Drosophila dorsal patterning network using reaction-diffusion 
equations and showed that the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) activation gradient is robust to changes in 
gene dosage. Li et al. [7] modeled the yeast cell-cycle network using Boolean network and showed that the 
cell-cycle network is robustly designed to against small perturbations. 
 
研究目的 
Although the above studies all successfully demonstrated in computer simulations that the specific gene 
regulatory networks are robust to parameter variations, they did not propose a quantitative robustness measure 
for gene regulatory networks. Therefore, they can not quantitatively know “how robust” a gene regulatory 
network is and can not quantitatively compare the robustness of different gene regulatory networks. Having a 
quantitative robustness measure for gene regulatory networks is very important especially for the studying the 
evolution the robustness [14,15] and for designing robust gene circuits in synthetic biology [16,17]. The aim 
of this study is to propose a quantitative robustness measure for gene regulatory networks. 
 
研究方法 
In this study, we will represent a gene regulatory network as a dynamical system. The dynamics of a gene 
regulatory network is described by a set of nonlinear coupled differential equations in power-law formalism 
[18]. This model is very general and is capable of capturing virtually any complicated phenomenon of a 
dynamical system, including complex oscillations and even chaos [18]. Moreover, the regular structure of this

IDENTIFICATION OF YEAST CELL CYCLE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS USING 
DYNAMIC SYSTEM MODEL

ABSTRACT 
 
To understand the cell cycle process, it is important to 
identify the cell cycle transcription factors (TFs) that 
regulate the expression of cell cycle-regulated genes. We 
developed a method to identify cell cycle TFs in yeast by 
integrating current ChIP-chip, mutant, transcription factor 
binding site (TFBS), and cell cycle gene expression data. 
We identified 17 cell cycle TFs, 12 of which are known cell 
cycle TFs, while the remaining five (Ash1, Rlm1, Ste12, 
Stp1, Tec1) are putative novel cell cycle TFs. Several lines 
of evidence are provided to verify our predictions. Besides, 
a high confidence TF-gene regulatory matrix is derived as a 
byproduct of our method. Moreover, we show that our 
method performs better than four existing methods for 
identifying yeast cell cycle TFs. Finally, an application of 
our method to different cell cycle gene expression datasets 
suggests that our method is robust. 
 
Index Terms— Cell cycle, yeast, transcription factor 
 
1. BACKGROUND 
 
Eukaryotic cell cycle is a complex process and is precisely 
regulated at many levels. One important aspect of this 
regulation is at the transcriptional level. That is, many genes 
specific to the cell cycle are transcribed just before they are 
needed [1]. To have a good understanding of the cell cycle, 
it is essential to identify the cell cycle-regulated genes and 
their transcriptional regulators. DNA microarray analysis 
has revealed that the expression levels of ~800 genes vary 
in a periodic fashion during the yeast cell cycle, but little is 
known about the transcriptional regulation of most of these 
genes [2,3]. To fill this gap, we aim to identify the cell cycle 
transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the cell cycle-
regulated genes inferred by DNA microarray analysis [2]. 
    Two major approaches have been proposed to identify 
cell cycle TFs. First, clustering and motif-discovering 
algorithms have been applied to cell cycle gene expression 
data to find sets of co-expressed genes and plausible 
binding motifs of their TFs [2,4]. However, this approach 
provides only indirect evidence of genetic regulatory 
interactions and does not directly identify the relevant cell 
cycle TFs. Second, the ChIP-chip technique was developed 
to identify physical interactions between TFs and promoters. 
Using ChIP-chip data, Simon et al. [3] investigated how the 
yeast cell cycle gene expression program is regulated by the 
gene i  and the promoter of gene i  contains one or more 
binding sites of TF j . Otherwise, , 0.i jb =  
However, binding of a TF to the promoter of a gene 
does not necessarily imply regulation. Hence, additional 
information is required to solve this ambiguity inherent in 
the TF-promoter binding matrix. Using a time-lagged 
dynamic model of gene regulation, we can refine the TF-
promoter binding matrix into a high-confidence TF-gene 
regulatory matrix. We consider the transcriptional 
regulatory mechanism of a target gene as a system with the 
regulatory profiles of several TFs as the inputs and the gene 
expression profile of the target gene as the output. The 
transcriptional regulation of a target gene is described by the 
following time-lagged dynamic system model [11]

where ][ty  represents the target gene’s expression profile 
at time point t , k  represents the target gene’s basal 
expression level induced by RNA polymerase II, N  
denotes the number of TFs that bind to the promoter of the 
target gene (inferred from the TF-promoter binding matrix 
B ), id  indicates the regulatory ability of TF i , [ ]ix t  
represents the regulatory profile of TF i  at time point t , iτ  
indicates the time lag for TF i  to exert a regulatory effect on 
the target gene’s expression, λ  indicates the degrading 
effect of the target gene’s expression value [ 1]y t −  at time 
point 1t −  on the target gene’s expression value [ ]y t  at 
time point t  and ][tε  denotes the stochastic noise due to 
the modeling error and the measuring error of the target 
gene’s expression profile. ][tε  is assumed to be a Gaussian 
noise with mean zero and unknown standard deviation .σ  
The biological meaning of Equation (1) is that [ ]y t  (the 
target gene’s expression value at time point t ) is 
determined by

1, ,i N= " ) and [ 1]y tλ− ⋅ −  (the degradation effect of 
the target gene at time point 1t − ). 
It has been shown that TF binding usually affects gene 
expression in a nonlinear fashion: below some level it has 
no effect, while above a certain level the effect may become 
saturated. This type of binding behavior can be modeled 
using a sigmoid function. Therefore, [ ]ix t  (the regulatory 
profile of TF i  at time point t ) is defined as a sigmoid 
function of [ ]iz t  (the gene expression profile of TF i  at 
time point t ) [12-14]:

where g  denotes the transition rate of the sigmoid function 
and iA  denotes the mean of the gene expression profile of 
TF i . It is also known that the regulatory effect of a TF on 
its target genes may not be simultaneous but has a time lag 
[12-14]. Therefore, we incorporate a time lag term into our 
dynamic system model. The time lag iτ  between TF i  and 
the target gene y  is determined by arg max ( )i

, M  is 
the number of time points of the target gene’s expression 
profile and Q  is the maximal time lag of the TF’s 
regulatory profile considered. The time lag may be 
interpreted as the time for a TF to exert a regulatory effect 
on its target gene’s expression. The value of Q  is chosen to 
make the maximal time lag approximately equal to two 
consecutive cell cycle phases because Simon et al. [3] found 
cases where a cell cycle TF that expresses in one phase of 
the cell cycle can regulate genes that function in the next 
phase. 
After writing down the time-lagged dynamic system 
model of gene regulation, the next step is to estimate the 
unknown parameters in the model. We rewrite Equation (1)

statistical method (Fisher’s G test). Cokus et al. [20] 
identified 12 cell cycle TFs by applying linear regression 
analysis. Andersson et al. [21] identified 15 cell cycle TFs 
by applying rule-based modeling. Since these four 
approaches are different from ours, a performance 
comparison should be done. As suggested by de 
Lichtenberg et al. [9], we tested the ability of each of these 
five methods to retrieve the known cell cycle TFs annotated 
in the MIPS database [17]. Performance comparison was 
based on the Jaccard similarity score [22], which scores the 
overlaps between a method’s output and the list of known 
cell cycle TFs (i.e., the true answers). Therefore, the higher 
the Jaccard similarity score, the better the ability of a 
method to retrieve the known cell cycle TFs. As shown in 
Table 1, our method has the highest Jaccard similarity score 
among the five methods. Therefore, our method 
outperforms the four existing methods. 
 
3.3. Robustness against different cell cycle gene 
expression datasets 
 
We applied our method to two newer cell cycle gene 
expression datasets (alpha26 and alpha38) published by 
Pramila et al. in 2006 [23]. Both datasets are alpha-factor 
synchronized microarray time series spanning two cell 
cycles. The alpha26 dataset has a sampling interval of 10 
minutes and a total of 13 data points, and the alpha38 
dataset has a sampling interval of 5 minutes and a total of 25 
data points. We found that among the 17 cell cycle TFs 
identified using Spellman et al.’s dataset, 14 TFs are also 
identified using the alpha38 dataset, and 12 TFs are also 
identified using the alpha26 dataset (see Figure 3). This 
suggests that our method is robust against different cell 
cycle gene expression datasets. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
We developed a method to identify cell cycle TFs in yeast 
by integrating current ChIP-chip, mutant, TFBS, and cell 
cycle gene expression data. We identified 17 cell cycle TFs, 
12 of which are known cell cycle TFs. The remaining five 
TFs (Ash1, Rlm1, Ste12, Stp1, Tec1) are putative novel cell 
cycle TFs. Our predictions are supported by interactions 
(physical or genetic) data and previous studies. Besides, a 
high-confidence TF-gene regulatory matrix is derived as a 
byproduct of our method. Each TF-gene regulatory 
relationship in this matrix is supported by at least three data 
sources: gene expression, TFBS, and ChIP-chip or/and 
mutant data. Moreover, we compared the performance of 
our method with four existing methods and showed that our 
method has a better ability to retrieve the known cell cycle 
TFs. Finally, applying our method to different cell cycle 
gene expression datasets, we identify similar sets of TFs, 
suggesting that our method is robust.
