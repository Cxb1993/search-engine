本研究利用DOWEX M4195樹脂萃取法評估四種不同有機資材降低六價鉻污染土壤
中有效性六價鉻之效果。蔗渣堆肥、牛糞堆肥、大豆粕及米糠分別添加至供試土
壤中(500 mg Cr(VI) (kg soil)-1)使土壤增加 0、1%及 2% 之有機質。研究結果
指出使土壤增加 1% 之有機質並孵育 12 天即能有效降低土壤中樹脂可抽出六價
鉻含量，而根據 X 光近邊緣結構光譜 (XANES) 分析結果，土壤中樹脂可抽出六
價鉻含量降低主要是因為六價鉻還原成三價鉻。在四種供試有機資材中，大豆粕
及米糠能夠較有效的降低土壤中樹脂可抽出六價鉻，主要是因為它們有較高之可
溶性有機碳及蛋白質含量。因此有機資材中之可溶性有機碳及蛋白質含量為評估
有機資材降低六價鉻污染土壤中有效性六價鉻之效果之重要因子。 
由於有機資材之還原速率慢，且於鹼性土壤中其還原效果不顯著，因此本研究另
添加亞鐵離子、連二亞硫酸鈉及亞鐵與連二亞硫酸鈉混合液 (4:1 mol/mol) 於六
價鉻汙染鹼性土壤中，各別評估其降低土壤中樹脂可抽出六價鉻含量之效果。結
果顯示，當亞鐵離子等還原劑添加當量與鹼性汙染土中六價鉻當量相同時，土壤
中樹脂可抽出六價鉻含量顯著降低。X 光近邊緣結構光譜 (XANES) 分析顯
示，土壤中六價鉻經由還原劑處理而還原成三價鉻，推測化學還原劑的添加可將
六價鉻還原成三價鉻使得樹脂可抽出六價鉻含量降低。當 Fe(II) 溶液 pH 小於 
1 時，能夠降低最多土壤中樹脂可抽出六價鉻含量，但土壤 pH 隨該 Fe(II)溶液
的加入而降低。在本研究所選用的還原劑中，兩種以 4:1 (mol/mol) 混合之 Fe(II) 
與 Na2S2O4 溶液於 pH 1~ 6 時皆能夠有效降低土壤中樹脂可抽出六價鉻含量，
混合溶液處理之土壤 pH 值改變量也較添加 Fe(II) 溶液小，故可避免在酸性環
境下 Cr(III) 可能帶來的危害。

soil and to investigate their effectiveness to reduce Cr(VI) com-
pared with that of SCDC and CDC, both of which are less readily
decomposed.
Since the amount of soil available Cr(VI) is a better index than
the total amount of Cr(VI) for evaluating the mobility and toxic-
ity of Cr(VI), the effectiveness of organic materials in remediating
Cr(VI)-contaminated soils in this study is assessedbyexamining the
decrease in soil available Cr(VI) after adding organic materials. In
ourprevious study,wedemonstrated that theDOWEXM4195resin-
extraction method is feasible for extracting soil available Cr(VI)
[2,15]. However, it is difﬁcult to interpret whether the decrease
of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in soils after being amended by organic
matter is due to the reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) or the sorption of
Cr(VI) by the soil components. X-ray adsorptionnear edge structure
(XANES) spectroscopy is a useful tool to distinguish between the
species of Cr, Cr(VI) or Cr(III), in soils [15,17]. Therefore, in addition
to the resin-extraction method, XANES spectroscopy was used to
examine the extent of Cr(VI) reduction after amendment by organic
materials.
The purpose of this studywas to apply theDOWEXM4195 resin-
extraction method to evaluate the effectiveness of various organic
materials (i.e. SCDC, CDC, SBM, and RB) for decreasing the amounts
of available Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-contaminated soils. In addition, the
XANES method was used to examine the extent of the reduction
of Cr(VI) by adding organic materials.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of resins
The purchased resins (DOWEX M4195, particle size >40 mesh)
were ﬁrst immersed in distilled water for 2 days and washed with
1N HCl for 1 day. The resins were then rinsed thoroughly with
distilledwater and transferred to a column to be converted into Cu-
saturated form by elutingwith 500mgL−1 CuCl2. The Cu-saturated
resinswere then rinsed thoroughlywithdistilledwater, oven-dried,
and stored for further use [2,15].
A 60-mesh polypropylene net was used to make the resin bag.
The Cu-saturated resins were retained in the bag for separating the
resins from the soil particles. The resin bags were washed with 1N
HCland thenrinsedwithdistilledwaterandovendriedbeforeusing
it.
2.2. Preparation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soil
Three soils of Taiwan [Pinchung (Pc), Chingchung (Cf), and
Taikang (TK)] were used in this study. Soil pH was determined by
a pH meter (soil:H2O=1:1). Soil texture was measured using the
hydrometer method [18]. Soil total nitrogen was analyzed by the
Kjeldahl method [19]. Soil organic carbon content was determined
using the Walkley-Black method [20], and the content of free iron
oxides was analyzed by the DCB method [21].
One and 1/2kg of air-dried soils were ﬁrst added with 300mL
distilled water and then with or without 75mL K2Cr2O7 solution
which had 10,000mgCr(VI) L−1. After that, soils were again sup-
pliedwith distilledwater to reach their water holding capacity. The
levels of Cr(VI) addition to the soils were 0 and 500mg (kg soil)−1,
respectively. Then the Cr(VI)-spiked soils were mixed thoroughly
andair-dried at roomtemperature. The air-driedCr(VI)-spiked soils
were then ground and passed through a 10-mesh sieve. Distilled
water was then added again to the soils to reach the water hold-
ing capacity. The wetting and air-drying procedures were repeated
three times to mimic ﬁeld conditions, and each cycle lasted for
around 4 weeks.
After three wetting- and air-drying cycles, the Cr(VI)-spiked
soils were digested by aqua regia to determine the total concentra-
tion of Cr in Cr(VI)-spiked soils, using the following procedures. Soil
samples (0.5 g) were added into 100mL digestion tubes and rinsed
with 0.5mL H2O. The aqua regia (10mL, HNO3:HCl =1:3 v/v) was
then added slowly into the digestion tubes. After standing for 16h,
soil samples were heated on a hot plate at 140 ◦C for 2h and then
the cooled digests were ﬁltered through Whatman No. 42 ﬁlters
anddiluted to 100mLwith 0.5Mnitric acid. TheCr concentration in
the digestswas determined by using ICP-OES (PerkinElmer, Optima
2000). TheCr concentrationof a certiﬁed reference soil sample (BCR
143R) was also determined by the same procedure to conﬁrm the
reliability of the digestion method. The recovery of Cr for the certi-
ﬁed reference soil sample by using the aqua regia digestionmethod
was 98%.
2.3. Properties of amending organic materials
Four organic materials, SCDC, CC, SBM and RB were used in this
study. ThepHof theorganicmaterialswasmeasuredusing the same
methods as used for the soil samples. The organic matter content
of the tested materials was determined using the loss-on-ignition
method [22]. The DOC was extracted using distilled water (1:50,
organic material:water ratio) for 24h, ﬁltered through a 0.45m
membrane and then determined by TOC analyzer, O.I. analytical,
Model 1010. The organic carbon and total nitrogen content were
analyzed by CNS analyzer, LECO, CNS 2000, and the 6.25-folds of
total nitrogen were regarded as the crude protein content of the
organic materials. The amount of crude lipid was determined by
using the Soxhlet extractionwith n-hexane for 24h. After the Soxh-
let extraction, the sampleswere extractedwithH2O in a75 ◦Cwater
bath for 24h to determine the soluble sugar content. After the sol-
uble sugar extraction, the contents of hemicellulose and cellulose
were determined by the Nelson–Somogyi method [23]. The lignin
content was estimated by subtracting the crude protein, crude
lipid, soluble sugar, hemicellulose, cellulose, and ash from the total
weight of the organic materials [16].
2.4. Cr(VI)-spiked soils amended with organic material and
Cr(VI) extraction using resins
Organicmatterwas added intoCr(VI)-spiked soilswith0, 1% and
2%bydryweight in the formofSCDC,CDC, SBMandRB, respectively.
The treatment without adding organic materials was used as the
control. The soils amended by organic materials as well as the con-
trol were then incubated at ﬁeld capacity at 20 ◦C. Soils were taken
out after 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 30 and 40 days of incubation, then air-dried
and ground to pass through a 80-mesh sieve for resin extraction.
Five grams of Cr(VI)-spiked soils amended by organic materials
were placed in a 250mL ﬂask. One polypropylene bag contain-
ing 0.5 g of Cu-saturated resins and 100mL of distilled water were
added into the ﬂask and were then shaken for 24h to extract soil
Cr(VI). At the end of the shaking period, the resin bag was taken
out and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. The resin bag was
transferred into another ﬂask, which contained 100mL of 10% NaCl
solution (pH 4.5) and shaken for 24h to desorb the Cr(VI) from the
resin. The desorption processwas repeated twice, and the amounts
of Cr(VI) in the desorption solution was determined by ICP-OES,
PerkinElmer, Optima 2000.
2.5. XANES Analysis
Due to the XANES beam time arrangement and preventing the
Cr species change during the sample storage period, another set of
Cr(VI)-spiked soils with and without added organic matters in the

tion [mg (kg soil)−1] before adding organic matters, k is the rate
coefﬁcient (day−1). The rate coefﬁcients are shown in Table 5, and
indicate that they follow the order of RB≈ SBM>CDC>SCDC. The
results suggest that the rate of decreasing soil resin-extractable
Cr(VI) by adding RB and SBM is faster than by adding CDC and SCDC.
The difference in rate coefﬁcients among tested organic materials
can be explained by the different contents of DOC, composition,
and C/N ratio of the added organic materials. Previous research has
indicated that the amount ofDOC inorganicmaterials has apositive
correlation to the Cr(VI) reduction rate [1]. As shown in Table 2, the

4. Conclusion
The amounts of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-contaminated
soils was effectively decreased by adding 1% organic matter of
tested organic materials. The results of the XANES spectra indi-
cated that the decrease of resin-extractable Cr(VI) was mainly due
to the reduction of Cr(VI) by the added organic matter. Among the
tested organic materials, SBM and RB contained a higher amount
of DOC and easily decomposed substances. As a result they were
more effective in decreasing resin-extractable Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-
contaminated soils than SCDC and CDC for the same amounts of
organic matter applied and the same incubation time. Therefore,
it is suggested that organic materials containing large amounts
of DOC and consisting of easily decomposed matter are good
candidates for amending Cr(VI)-contaminated soils by effectively
decreasing the amount of soil resin-extractable Cr(VI).

There is a concern that after injecting ferrous irons into an alkaline
subsurface, clogging occurs resulting in the oxidation of Fe(II) by
oxygen. This is more likely in an alkaline system and thus the
effectiveness of reducing Cr(VI) into Cr(III) is decreased. Geelhoed
et al. [20] found that the precipitation of iron took place when
FeSO4 was added into chromium ore processing waste, resulting
from residueswith high pH. In addition, the SO42− from FeSO4 may
also contribute to the increased leaching of CrO42−. The third group
of reductants are reduced-sulfur compounds such as hydrogen
sulﬁde [21], sodium metabisulﬁte (Na2S2O5), and sodium dithion-
ite [22,23]. Previous studies indicated that dithionite was useful
for the in situ remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated groundwater
when accompanied with K2CO3/KHCO3 buffer at pH 11 [22–24].
Istok et al. [22] indicated that Na2S2O4 was able to reduce Fe(III)
to Fe(II) in the environment, and that the reaction occurred via the
following equations:
S2O42− +2Fe3+ +2H2O → 2SO32− +2Fe2+ +4H+. (2)
The produced Fe2+ can then be used to reduce Cr(VI) into Cr(III)
based on Eq. (1). In addition, the decomposed products of dithion-
ite, such as sulﬁte (SO32−), bisulﬁte (HSO3−), and thiosulfate
(S2O32−), can reduce the Cr(VI) into Cr(III) directly in long-term
groundwater treatment by the following reaction [25]:
6H+ +2HCrO4− +3HSO3− → 2Cr3+ +2SO4− + S2O62− +6H2O.
(3)
However, the effectiveness of adding Na2S2O4 to decrease the
concentration of Cr(VI) is limited due to the low contents of
dithionite-reducible iron in Cr(VI)-contaminated sites [14]. In
addition, the reaction rate of Cr(VI) reduction into Cr(III) by adding
dithionite decomposed products decreases with the increasing
pH [25]. These three groups of reductants were used effectively
in some cases for reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III). However, their
effectiveness and application are conﬁned by the need of a long
incubation time when organic matters amendments are used.
Clogging occurs when ferrous iron is added. When dithion-
ite is used, the effectiveness is conﬁned by a low content of
dithionite-reducible iron in Cr(VI)-contaminated sites.
Su and Ludwig [14] demonstrated that the effectiveness of
decreasing the amount of Cr(VI) in the residue of alkaline ore pro-
cessing was higher when adding a solution of 0.05M FeSO4 and
0.05MNa2S2O4 (1:1mol/mol, pH 3.5) thanwhen adding a solution
of 0.05M FeSO4 or 0.05M Na2S2O4 alone at similar pH, respec-
tively. They hypothesized that ferrous iron could be stabilized by
H+ generated from the reaction of Na2S2O4 and Fe(III) oxides. And,
that by addingmixed reductants the Cr(VI) reduction is dominated
by Fe(II) rather than by the contribution from Na2S2O4. To the
best of our knowledge, there are few studies in the literature that
have investigated the effectiveness of adding a mixture of ferrous
iron and dithionite to decrease the Cr(VI) concentration in alka-
line Cr(VI)-contaminated soils. In addition, the extent of aqueous
Fe(II) oxidation by dissolved O2 and dithionite is affected by pH
[26,27]. Thus, the effectiveness of ferrous iron, dithionite, and the
mixture of ferrous iron and dithionite for decreasing Cr(VI) concen-
tration in an alkaline conditionmay be affected by the solution pH.
Therefore, it is worthwhile to test the effectiveness of the reduction
of Cr(VI) in alkaline soils by stoichiometrically adding reductants,
FeSO4, Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, Na2S2O4, and amixture of ferrous iron and
Na2S2O4, at various pH.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that the mobility and
phytotoxicity of Cr(VI)were better evaluated by using the soil avail-
able Cr(VI) content than by using the total amount of Cr(VI). In
addition,wedemonstrated that theDOWEXM4195 resin extraction
method is feasible for extracting soil available Cr(VI) [7,16]. There-
fore, the effectiveness of reductants at various pH levels to decrease
the amount of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-contaminated soils
is assessed in this study.Moreover, in our previous experiments, the
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was
demonstrated to be able to examine the extent of Cr(VI) reduc-
tion after amendment by organic materials. The pre-edge peak at
5992eV in Cr K-edge XANES spectra was a unique characteristic of
Cr(VI), but not of Cr(III), and therefore the pre-edge peak was used
to identify the speciation of Cr in our studies [28].
In this study, the DOWEX M4195 resin extraction method
was used to evaluate the effectiveness of various reductants,
FeSO4, Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, Na2S2O4, and a mixture of ferrous iron
and Na2S2O4 (4:1mol/mol), to decrease the soil resin-extractable
Cr(VI). The effect of the pH of the added reductants on the amounts
of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-contaminated soils was also
investigated. The XANES method was employed to examine the
extent of the reductionof Cr(VI) intoCr(III) by the added reductants.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Soil properties and the preparation of Cr(VI)-contaminated
soils
Two representative alkaline soils from Taiwan, Chengchung (Cf)
and Taikang (Tk), were selected in this study. The pH of these soils
was measured in 1:1 soil/H2O suspension by using a pH meter
(Table 1). The soil organic carbon and free iron oxide contents were
determined by the Walkley-Black method [29] and the sodium
dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (DCB) method [30], respectively.
One kg of soil was spiked with 0, 50, 100, and 200mL K2Cr2O7
solution (5000mgCr(VI) L−1) to reach the level of 0, 250, 500, and
1000mgkg−1 Cr in soil, respectively. Then, distilled water was
added to the soils to reach the soil water-holding capacity. They
underwent three wetting–drying cycles at room temperature to
mimic ﬁeld conditions. Each cycle lasted for around 30 days. After-
wards, the soils were ground to pass through a 10-mesh sieve, and
stored for further use.
2.2. Amending Cr(VI)-spiked soils with reductants
The 100g Cr(VI)-spiked soils were mixed with the reductants,
0.2M FeSO4, 0.2M Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 0.1M Na2S2O4 with 0.05M
K2CO3, and a mixture of 0.2M Fe(II) and 0.1M Na2S2O4, respec-
tively. Based on Eqs. (1) and (2), the application rate of the
reductants (number of equivalents) was equal to the number of
equivalents of dichromate added to 0, 250, 500, and 1000mgkg−1
in Cr(VI)-spiked soils. Since one mole of Fe(II) and S2O42− were

investigate the effectiveness of those reductants on decreasing
resin-extractable Cr(VI).
3.2. Effectiveness of adding various reductants to decrease soil
resin-extractable Cr(VI)
Since the amounts of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in 250mgkg−1
Cr(VI)-spiked Cf and Tk soils were too small for comparing the
effectivenessof adding reductants todecrease the contents of resin-
extractable Cr(VI), the results of adding reductants in 250mgkg−1
Cr(VI) in soil are not presented and are not discussed in this paper.
Theamountof soil resin-extractableCr(VI) in500and1000mgkg−1
in Cr(VI)-spiked soils without or with adding reductants, when the
application rates of the reductants equal the number of equivalents
of dichromate added into soils, are given in Table 3. After adding
the reductants, Na2S2O4 with 0.05M K2CO3, FeSO4, Fe(NH4)2SO4,
a mixture of FeSO4 and Na2S2O4 (4:1mol/mol), and a mixture of
Fe(NH4)2SO4 andNa2S2O4 (4:1mol/mol), respectively, into 500mg
Cr(VI)-spiked soils, the amounts of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in Cf
soils were below the detection limit. They were less than 5% of
the spiked-Cr(VI) that could be extracted from the Tk soils. In the
reductants-added 1000mgkg−1 Cr(VI) in soils, less than 1% and 2%
of the spiked-Cr(VI) could be extracted from the Cf and Tk soils,
respectively. The effectiveness of adding reductants to decrease
resin-extractable Cr(VI) is shownmainly by the result of the reduc-
tion of Cr(VI) into Cr(III). This is supported by the XANES spectra
of reductant-added Cr(VI)-spiked soils (Fig. 1). Based on the cal-
ibration curve of the Cr(VI) peak height vs. the Cr(VI) percentage
(Fig. 1(a)), there were about 5% and 56% Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-spiked Cf
andTk soilswithout adding reductants, respectively. For thepeak at
5992eV, the unique characteristics of Cr(VI) (but not from Cr(III)),
reductant-treated soil samples were below the detection limit in
the XANES spectra. This indicates that the decrease of soil resin-
extractable Cr(VI) by adding reductants was mainly due to Cr(VI)
reduction into Cr(III) rather than the Cr(VI) sorption by soils.
Therewereno signiﬁcant differences (p<0.05) in the amounts of
resin-extractable Cr(VI) among all the reductant treatments, except
in the 500mgkg−1 Cr(VI) in Tk soils when the application rate of
reductants was equal to the number of equivalent of added dichro-
mate in soils. Therefore it is difﬁcult to compare the effectiveness of
the tested reductants to decrease the amounts of resin-extractable
Cr(VI). In order to compare the effectiveness of added reductants
in decreasing the contents of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in soils, the
application rate of reductants was decreased to 1/2 the number of
equivalents of added dichromate in 1000mgkg−1 in Cr(VI)-spiked
Tk soils in this study. The amounts of resin-extractable Cr(VI) of Tk
soils are shown in Table 4. Among the ﬁve reductants, the effec-
tiveness of Na2S2O4 with 0.05M K2CO3 was the lowest, and that of
themixture of ferrous iron and Na2S2O4 (4:1mol/mol) for decreas-
ing resin-extractable Cr(VI) were the highest. The low effectiveness
of Na2S2O4 to decrease resin-extractable Cr(VI) might be due to
the fact that even though the Tk soil has signiﬁcant amounts of
free iron oxides, only a small portion of Fe(III) in the studied soils
could be reduced into Fe(II) by the added Na2S2O4. Consequently
the Fe(II) could react with Cr(VI) to form the precipitates [15,22].
On the other hand, if most of the Fe(III) in Cr(VI)-spiked soil could
be reduced into Fe(II), the precipitation of FeS might occur in alka-
line soil [30,32], and thus the extent of the Cr(VI) reduction into
Cr(III) could be inhibited. Su and Ludwig [14] considered that fer-
rous iron could be stabilized by H+ from the reaction of Na2S2O4
with Fe(III) oxides. They hypothesized that the Cr(VI) reduction by
adding the mixed reductant of Fe(II) and Na2S2O4, is dominated by
Fe(II) rather than by the contribution from Na2S2O4. In this study,
we found that the extent of decreasing soil resin-extractable Cr(VI)

iron and dithionite (4:1mol/mol) at pH 1.4–6.3. This suggests that
the mixture of ferrous iron and dithionite in a wide range of pH
were all efﬁcient for decreasing the amounts of resin-extractable
Cr(VI) in alkaline Cr(VI)-spiked soils, without decreasing the soil
pH. Thus the possible risk from soluble Cr(III) and total dissolved Cr
in soils might be minor when adding a mixture of ferrous iron and
dithionite rather than by adding FeSO4 at pH<1 alone for reme-
diating alkaline Cr(VI)-contaminated soils. The long-term fate of
the stabilized soil Cr after amending the reductants needs to be
further studied. The possibility of Cr(III) re-oxidizing into Cr(VI)
was not expected except in soils with high amount of Mn oxides
[33].
4. Conclusion
The amount of resin-extractable Cr(VI) in the tested Cr(VI)-
spiked alkaline soils was decreased to less than 5% of spiked-Cr(VI)
by adding Na2S2O4 with K2CO3, FeSO4, Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, and a
mixture of ferrous iron and dithionite (4:1mol/mol), respectively,
when the application rate of the reductants (number of equiva-
lent) was equal to the number of equivalent of dichromate added
into the soils. The decrease of intensities of the XANES Cr(VI) peak
in the spectra of the Cr(VI)-spiked soil samples with reductants
treatments proved that the decrease of resin-extractable Cr(VI) by
added reductants was due to Cr(VI) reduction into Cr(III). When
the application rate of the reductants was decreased to 1/2 the
number of equivalent of dichromate added into the soils, the
mixture of ferrous iron and dithionite was the most effective to
decrease the soil resin-extractable Cr(VI) among the tested reduc-
tants. The reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) was mainly due to the
Fe(II) fromtheadded ferrous iron insteadof fromthe soil dithionite-
reducible Fe(III). Adding reductants with various pH, FeSO4 at pH
below 1 was the most effective for decreasing resin-extractable
Cr(VI) in alkaline soils. However, this decreased the soil pH the
most (from 7.9 to 3.5) among the tested reductants. On the other
hand, the mixture of ferrous iron and dithionite with a wide pH
range was very efﬁcient in decreasing the resin-extractable Cr(VI)
into Cr(III) in the studied Cr(VI)-spiked soil. This also decreased
the soil pH to a much lesser degree compared to the added
FeSO4 (pH<1) alone, thereby avoiding the possibility of the Cr(III)
hazard.
