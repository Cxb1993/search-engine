2INTRODUCTION
The dialysis of blood is a widely used method for the treatment of renal failure.
Haemodialysis, which appeared in the 1970s as the treatment of choice chronic renal
failure consists in circulating blood across cellulose or synthetric membranes in order to
decrease, by filtration, the level of low molecular weight metabolites (urea, creatinine) or
even low molecular weight proteins which are likely to contribute to the uremic
syndrome [1]. The most widely used devices for the treatment of renal failure utilize
membranes in a hollow fiber format. Asymmetric membranes are widely used in many
industrial membrane separation processes. The spinning process of hollow fiber may
look simple, yet it is tedious to find the appropriate conditions to obtain the desirable
morphology and permeation performance. The spinning conditions such as the
compositions of the spinning solution (the dope), the bore liquid, and the coagulant, the
spinning temperature, the flow rates of the dope and bore liquid, the take-up speed, and
the air gap, are all affecting the resulting hollow fibers. The spinning process of hollow
fiber may look simple, yet it is tedious to find the appropriate conditions to obtain the
desirable morphology and permeation performance. The spinning conditions such as
the compositions of the spinning solution, the bore liquid, and the coagulant, the spinning
temperature, the flow rates of the dope and bore liquid, the take-up speed, and the air gap,
are all affecting the resulting hollow fibers. Many researchers reported that the spun
conditions and the coagulant control the formation of the skin layers during spinning
[2–9]. In general, fibers are drawn to improve their mechanical properties. Drawing is
simply the mechanical elongation of a fiber in the direction of its axis. During this
process the molecular chains become oriented in the direction of drawing, thus the
physical properties are improved [10,11]. However, the fibers with smaller diameter are
formed at high draw ratios, which may be associated with high tensile stress on spin line
[12]. Hemoperfusion employs sorbents such as active carbon, ion-exchange and
non-ion exchange resins to effectively remove liposoluble toxins such as uric acid,
creatinine, phenols, indicant, and medium molecular weight proteins [13]. Attention
was focused on the removal of a model solute, along with urea and creatinine, is one of
the most abundant uremic solutes to be removed from the blood of nephropathic
individuals. In this article, we spun PAN hollow fiber and followed by oxidation,
carbonization, and activation to produce activated carbon hollow fibers (ACHFs). The
effect of activation conditions on the adsorption of uric acid, creatinine, and vitamin B12
was investigated in this work. The result of this work is expected to lead to the
development of a hemodialyzer with the ability of hemoperfuser. This will be beneficial
to the dialysis technology.
EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Adsorbates
Uric acid and creatinine were purchased from Merck, USA. Vitamin B12 was
purchased from Sigma, USA. Each adsorbate was dissolved separately in doubly
distilled water containing 0.9wt% of NaCl. The initial adsorbate concentrations used in
this study were close the concentrations measured in blood of healthy humans. Some of
their properties were given in Table 1.
42.5.Adsorption of AHCFs
The AHCF samples were soaked at a weight ratio of 100:1 in physiological saline
containing uric acid (15mg/dl), creatinine (20mg/dl), and vitamin B12 (5mg/dl) at 37C.
The concnetrations of the adsorbates were determined periodically using an
ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The adsorbency of the AHCF was calculated
from differences in the solution concentrations.
2.6. Porosity determination
The porosity of the hollow fiber membrane was determined by measuring the true
density and the bulk density. To measure the true density, a freeze-dried sample was
placed in a vacuum oven at 50°C for 24 hours and then the dry weight of the sample was
measured (M). Afterwards, the sample was put into a multivolume pycnometer (1305,
Micromeritics, USA) to measure the true volume (Vt). The true density (t) was then
calculated according to eq. (5). To measure the bulk density, a sample was vacuum
dried and then the inner and outer diameters of the sample were measured under a
microscope to obtain the bulk volume (Vb). The bulk density (b) was then calculated
according to eq. (6). The porosity (ρ) of the sample was calculated according to eq. (7).

3.Results and Discussion
3.1. The influence of the dope concentration and bore liquids of mechanical properties of
hollow fiber membranes
Table. 2 shows that the tensile strength measured in the dry state was higher than that
measured in the wet state. This is due to the plasticization effect of water makes the
disentanglement easier to occur. Generally water molecules in the fiber will reduce the
forces holding the molecular chains together [19]. Thus the stress applied was
concentrated at fewer entanglements and led to lower tensile strength. Higher dope
concentration and lower bore liquid temperature reduced the exchange rate of solvent and
water, thus resulted in a denser structure and hence higher strength. Table 2 also shows
that the breaking elongation decreases with the dope concentration. The decrease in the
breaking elongation occurred more drastically for the fibers spun from 30 wt.%. This can
be attributed to the denser structure resulted from higher dope concentration. In addition,
higher bore liquid temperature results in higher breaking elongation. This is because at
higher coagulant temperature, the demixing rate was faster, and the molecular chains
were frozen in a less ordered form. Under tensile stress, these molecules can be stretched
more to rearrange into a more ordered form. Therefore, the breaking elongation for the
fibers spun from higher bore liquid temperature would be higher. The elongation is
mainly the deformation of the amorphous regions where primary and secondary bonds
are stretched and sheared. This molecular rearrangement allows hollow fibers spun from
lower bore liquid temperature to withstand further stress [19].
3-2.Effects drawn ratio of hollow fiber precursor on the physical properties
Figure.1. show the relationship between the concentration of coagulant and the
6of surface area of AHCFs may be due to new pores created upon increasing extent of
activation, pore drilling and pore deepening effects [22,23]. After the pyrolysis and
carbonization, the unactivated carbon pores are filled with tar decomposition products
and are blocked with amorphous carbon substance. During activation, amorphous
carbon was burnt away, micropoes were widened, and neighboring pores were merged.
All these events led to more porous structure, and hence higher specific surface area.
The effect of activation on the tensile properties of the resulting AHCFs is shown in
Table.4 Sample A exhibited the highest tensile strength (0.56GPa) and highest Young’s
modulus. The tensile strength and the modulus decreased with the increase of activation
temperature. This may be attributed to the decrease of the crystal size. As shown in
Table.4 the stacking size decreased with the increase of activation temperature. This is
because that during activation, the molecules were attacked by CO2, and hence the crystal
size (Lc), (stacking size) was reduced. Smaller crystal size resulted in weaker tensile
properties. In addition, the increase of larger pores also increased the number of defects.
3.5. Effect of activation temperature on the pore size distribution
The pore size distribution of AHCFs shown in Figure.3 exhibits micropores (> 50
nm), mesopores (2 ~ 50 nm), and micropores (< 2 nm). Sample A exhibited a small
number of the meso-micropores peaking at 3 nm, and more mesopores peaking at 10 nm.
The majority of pores of sample A were macropores peaking at 70 nm and 200 nm. As
the activation temperature increased to 650C, the meso-micropores were enlarged to 5
nm, and the mesopores enlarged to 15nm, whereas those macropores enlarged to 80 and
220 nm, repectively. At 750C, the major peaks shifted to 100 and 280nm, while those
mesopores disappeared, the peak at 5 nm became higher, and two more peaks of
micropores at 1.5 and 2.5nm were observed. The results demonstrate that above 750C,
meso-micropore volume increased due to the fact that after the sintering of the skin layer,
the part of the graphitoidal structure were gasified by CO2 and those close pores were
opened to evolved into new pores. When activating at 850C, the peaks below 5 nm
disappeared, while the volume of mesopores increased with a peak at 25 nm. This
suggests that the more pores were opened and merged. In addition, those two major
peaks shifted to 125 and 300 nm, respectively. Therefore, the pore size distribution of
AHCFs depended on the activation temperature. In conclusion, the porosity of AHCFs
is dependent on the graphitic microcrystallite morphology and the stacking; at the same
time, the basic elemental composition can reflect the surface chemistry. It is shown that
the samples prepared by different temperatures are quite different either in graphitic
microcrystallite, surface chemistry or pore size distribution.
3.6. Adsorption isotherms for AHCFs
Equilibrium studied were carried out to determine the conditions for maximum
metabolism removal on AHCFs. The distribution of uric acid, creatinine and vitamin
B12 between the liquid phase is a measure of position of equilibrium in the adsorption
process and can be expressed by the Freundlich equations. This moduels are widely
used, the former being purely empirical which is an indicative of surface heterogeneity of
the sorbent, is given by the following linearized equation (8).
