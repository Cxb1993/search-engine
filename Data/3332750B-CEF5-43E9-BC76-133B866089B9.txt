Abstract 
 
In this 3-year NSC funded proposal, we 
have accomplished quite a few objectives 
regarding to the torsional rigidity of 
cylindrical shafts containing fibers or coated 
fibers with perfect bonding or imperfect 
bonding interfaces. First, we have established 
a general framework for torsion of 
anisotropic shafts in terms of warping 
function, conjugate function as well as stress 
potential, parallel to the existing frameworks 
for torsion of isotropic shafts. We prove an 
extremal property for the torsional rigidity of 
anisotropic composite shafts. For 
homogeneous shafts, an affine coordinate 
transformation is introduced, which 
demonstrates how the cross-sectional shape 
of the shaft is deformed (stretching and 
rotation) under the mapping, and how the 
warping field and the torsional rigidity of an 
anisotropic shaft are correlated to those of an 
isotropic one. Next, we derive bounds for the 
torsional rigidity of a cylindrical shaft with 
arbitrary transverse cross-section containing 
a number of cylindrically orthotropic fibers 
or coated fibers. The exact upper and lower 
bounds depend on the constituent shear 
rigidities, the area fractions, the locations of 
the reinforcements as well as the geometric 
 4
dependence of the torsional rigidity on the 
degree of imperfect bonding together with 
shape and position of the fibers within the 
shaft. Lipton and Chen (2004) further 
extended to the configuration of circular 
cross-sections containing many coated fibers 
in which the interfaces are perfectly bonded. 
They constructed explicit bounds for the 
torsional rigidity and, under an additional 
constraint, showed that the bounds will 
coincide and agree with the exact solution 
(Chen et al. 2002). The idea of the 
introduction of a coating phase (Lipton and 
Chen 2004) and that of the imperfect 
bonding considered in Lipton (1998) both 
provide an additional degree of freedom to 
fulfill the exactly solvable configuration 
constructed by an assemblage of neutral 
inclusions (see for example, Milton 2002, 
Benvensite and Chen 2001, Chen 2004, Ting 
et al. 2004). Recently, Chen and Lipton 
(2007) explored the influence of the 
cross-sectional shape of the host shaft. The 
shape effect of the host shaft explicitly enters 
into the expressions of the derived bounds. 
In addition, there has been a growing 
interest in the study of imperfect interfaces 
lately. Imperfect bonding between matrix and 
fibers is often caused by interfacial damage 
due to service loads or can be represented as 
a mathematical link due to a thin interphase 
between two neighboring media (Bovik 1994, 
Benveniste 2006). Some recent advances 
were reported from various perspectives in 
the contexts of elasticity and conduction (see 
Torquato and Rintoul 1995, Niklasson et al. 
2000, Ting 2007 and the references 
contained therein). In this report, we also 
focus on imperfect interfaces and are 
concerned with deriving rigorous bounds for 
the torsional rigidity of shaft with arbitrary 
cross-section. Two new features in contrast 
to earlier works are emphasized here. Firstly, 
two different kinds of imperfect interfaces 
(Benveniste and Chen 2001) are examined 
here: one which models a thin interphase of 
low shear modulus (LS), and one which 
models a thin interphase of high shear 
modulus (HS). In the former case, the shear 
traction on the interface is continuous but the 
axial warping displacement undergoes a 
discontinuitiy proportional to the axial shear 
traction. In the latter case, the warping 
displacement at the interface is continuous 
but the axial shear traction has a jump 
proportional to a differential operator of the 
warping function. Secondly, the transverse 
cross section of the host shaft can be 
arbitrary in geometry. We mention that the 
LS-type of interface was examined in Lipton 
(1998). But the geometric effects of the host 
shaft were not explicitly considered in their 
formulation. For the torsional rigidity bounds 
of composite shafts with HS-type interfaces, 
to the authors' knowledge, no relevent results 
have been reported in the literature before. 
The main derivation procedure is 
primarily based on classical energy 
principles in elasticity. By constructing either 
statically admissible fields or kinematically 
admissible fields interior to the cross-section, 
taking into account of different types of jump 
or continuity condition along the interface, 
we derive exact expressions for the bounds 
of the torsional rigidity of composite shafts. 
In addition to the constituent shear moduli 
and the absolute sizes and the positions of the 
fibers, the results also depend on the 
interface parameters and the cross-sectional 
shape of the host shaft. Lastly it is mentioned 
that the mathematical framework of the 
HS-type of interface is exactly the same with 
that of interface conditions (Young-Laplace 
equations) with surface/interface stress 
(Povstenko 1993, Shenoy 2002).

2.4 Variational principles 
 
It is known that the torsional rigidity 
can be related to the minimum principles of 
energies. The first variational principle is 
based on constructing complementary energy 
in terms of virtual stress potentials Φ  that 
vanish on the lateral boundary of the shaft 
and are square integrable having square 
integrable gradients. Without including 
detailed formulations, the minimum principle 
of complementary energy can be expressed 
in the form 
 
 
(2.17) 
The second variational principle is given in 
terms of virtual warping functions ϕ  that 
are square integrable and have square 
integrable gradients. Specifically, it has the 
form 
 
 
min ( )( ) ( ) .
r
xdyϕ ϕ ϕ⊥ ⊥Ω 
              (2.18) 
These two variational forms of the torsional 
rigidity will serve useful basis in 
constructing bounds on torsional rigidity of 
composite anisotropic shafts. 
 
2.5 An extremal property of the 
torsional rigidity 
 
Since ( )rD ϕ  and ( )rD ψ  are 
non-negative, we conclude that the torsional 
rigidity of a composite anisotropic shaft is 
bounded above by

The equality sign holds only when 
( ) ( ) 0r rD Dϕ ψ= = . This will occur if and 
only if the warping displacement is a 
constant. Chen (2004a) recently proved that a 
certain class of homogeneous elliptical shafts 
will not warp under torsion. Thus the upper 
bound on the right-side of (2.19) can be 
actually attained by certain anisotropic 
elliptical shafts.

4. Bounds on the torsional rigidity of 
shafts containing fibers with 
imperfect interfaces  
 
4.1 Description of the problem 
We derive rigorous bounds for the 
torsional rigidity of a cylindrical shaft 
containing  circular fibers with imperfect 
bonding interfaces. The shaft cross-section 
 is simply connected but could be 
arbitrary in shape. The outer boundary of 
N
Ω
Ω  
is characterized by . At the interfaces  
between the fibers and matrix we consider 
that they are imperfectly bonded. Specifically 
two kinds of imperfect interfaces are 
considered (Benvensite and Chen 2001): one 
which models a thin interphase of low shear 
modulus (LS) and one which models a thin 
interphase of high shear modulus (HS). The 
mathematical framework of these imperfect 
interfaces can be derived by considering a 
thin interphase, (designated as subscript ), 
of constant thickness  with relatively low 
or high shear modulus μ  via a proper 
limiting process. The interface parameter 
which measures the stiffness of the interface 
is represented by  for the LS-type 
interface and by  for the HS-type interface

Both parameters have the dimension of 
stiffness/length and are nonnegative along 
the interfaces. We note that perfect bonding 
interfaces, where there are no jump on the 
warping displacement and normal component 
of shear traction, correspond to either 
 or . The mathematical 
frameworks for these two kinds of imperfect 
interfaces were given in Benvensite and 
Chen (2001). We briefly outline the basic 
equations here for convenience of exposition. 
For the LS interface, the shear traction is 
continuous, but the warping function 
undergoes a discontinuity which is 
proportional to the shear traction

across the interface, but the axial shear 
traction on the interface undergoes a
