I Introduction 
 
For future wireless communication systems, 
the need to gigabit transmission is growing. It 
can be applied in broadband vehicle or indoor 
multimedia connection, high-speed wireless 
communication, and high-speed connection 
among medical facilities. Nowadays, IEEE 
802.11/a/b/g standards provide transmission 
rate up to 54 Mbps. With MIMO technique, the 
speed can only boost to 108 Mbps, which 
cannot support high-quality media data. On the 
other hand, UWB technique can support a data 
rate up to 500 Mbps [1]-[3]. However, its 
bandwidth covers from 3 GHz to 10 GHz. 
Therefore, it will interfere with some existing 
wireless systems. Furthermore, its fractional 
bandwidth is so large that it faces many design 
difficulties [4]. The combo project was 
intended to develop a wireless transceiver in 
Ka-band. Each channel bandwidth is 2 GHz. 
Transmission rate is faster than 1 Gbps based 
on time division multiplexing. It can support 
BPSK, QPSK, and 16QAM. This sub-project 
was intended to develop a Ka-band phased 
array antenna in three years. 
This report will present a detailed design of 
a one by four antenna array. This array 
includes a one by four Wilkinson power 
divider, four microstrip line to parallel line 
transitions, and four antipodal tapered slot 
antennas. Each component is discussed 
separately. The overall performance of the 
array will also be presented. 
 
II 1x4 Wilkinson Power Divider 
 
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the 
1x4 Wilkinson power divider [5]. The 
simulation is carried out by the full-wave 
simulator IE3D. Port 1 is the input port, and 
port 2 to 5 are output ports. Port (6-7), port 
(8-9), and port(10-11) are lump ports for the 
100-ohm resistors. Each power divider consists 
of three 50-ohm feedlines, two 70.7-ohm 
quarter-wave line, and one 100-ohm resistor. 
And the 1x4 divider consists of three identical 
1x2 power divider. The spacing between two 
adjacent output ports is set to be 10 mm. The 
upper limit of the output spacing is set by 
grating lobes, and its lower limit is determined 
by the width of SMA connectors. The circuit is 
built on a 0.508-mm RO4003C substrate 
(dielectric constant = 3.55, loss tangent = 
0.0027 at 10 GHz/23oC). All the circuits 
discussed in this project use this substrate. To 
cover the bandwidth from 12 to 18 GHz, the 
center of the quarter-wave line is set at 14.7 
GHz. 
Figure 2 shows the photograph and the 
results of the power divider. It measures 32

(x1, y1) is the coordinate of the start point at the 
parallel stripline side, and (x2, y2) is the 
coordinate of the end point. R is determined 
as –0.15. 
Figure 7 shows the photograph and results 
of the antipodal tapered slot antenna. The 
measured return loss is better than 10 dB from 
10 GHz to 20 GHz. In order to reduce the 
cross-polarization level, each pair of the 
antennas includes a normal antenna and a 
mirrored one. It found that the response of a 
mirrored antenna has a similar response to that 
of the normal one. 
 
V Antenna Array 
 
With the above components, an one-by-four 
antenna array is implemented. It should be 
noted that the array is arranged in a mirrored 
type to reduce the cross-polarization level. 
Figure 8 shows the schematic diagram. It is 
clear that in each pair of mirrored antennas the 
electric fields in the cross-polarization 
direction cancel out to each other, and the 
electric fields in the co-polarization direction 
are in phase. Figure 9 shows the photograph 
and measured results of the array antenna. The 
measured return loss is better than 7 dB from 
12 GHz to 19 GHz. Figure 10 shows the 
antenna pattern results. The antenna gain is 
about 10 dBi with a variation of less than 1.3 
dB. The cross-polarization level is 25 dB 
below to the co-polarization level.  
 
IV Phased Shifter 
 
Figure 11 shows the schematic diagram of a 
phased shifter [11]. It consists of a 
piezoelectric transducer (PET), a triangular 
dielectric perturber, and four 50-ohm 
microstrip lines. The differential phase shift is 
dependent on the dielectric constants of 
substrate and perturber and the perturber length 
on microstrip line. The differential phase shift 
φ∆n  on the nth microstrip line caused by the 
perturbation is calculated as  ( ) 3,2,1,)()(2 '
0
=−⋅=∆ nffnLn effeff εελ
πφ  
where L is the length of perturber over 
microstrip line number 1, and ( )feffε  and 
( )feff'ε  are the effective relative permittivities 
of the unperturbed and perturbed microstrip 
line, respectively. The progressive phase shift 
between any two neighboring microstrip lines 
is φ∆ . The element spacing should be smaller 
than the half wavelength at the highest 
frequency to avoid the grating lobes. As the 
free space wavelength 0λ  at 18 GHz is 16.7 
mm, the array spacing is designed as 10 mm 
considering the SMA size. The PET is driven 
using an external 90-volt DC source. Figure 12 
shows the calculated array factor. The steered 
angle is about 25 degrees. To realize the 
25-degree scanning, the required phase shift is 
60 degrees at 12 GHz and 90 degrees at 18 
GHz. Figure 13 shows the simulated phase 
shift. The simulation is carried out in Ansoft 
HFSS. The micorstrip lines are on 20-mil 
RO4003 substrate. The line width is 1.1 mm 
for 50-ohm line. The perturber is a 25-mil 
RT/Duroid 6010 substrate. When the covered 
line length is 10 mm, the phase shift is 58 
degrees at 12 GHz and 91 degrees at 18 GHz. 
Therefore, L should be determined as 10 mm.
