5. 論文摘要 
This study presents a double-spread code-division multiple-access 
(CDMA) scheme for radio-over-fiber (RoF) transmissions. The network 
coder/decoders (codecs) are implemented using arrayed-waveguide 
grating (AWG) routers coded with maximal-length sequence 
(M-sequence) codes. The effects of phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) 
and multiple-access interference (MAI) on the system performance are 
evaluated numerically for different values of the optical modulation index 
(OMI) during the nonlinear electro-optical modulator (EOM) response. 
At low OMI optical device noise is dominant, but at high OMI nonlinear 
effect becomes significant. Numerical result shows that the system

signals to the CS in an optical format and to transmit RF signals
in an electrical format. More complex tasks such as modulating
the RF signal to an appropriate format are performed at the CS.
Optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) [4–12]
provides a powerful solution for RoF network access schemes
designed to allow multiple users to access the same fiber chan-
nel in local area networks (LANs) asynchronously without
delay or the need for scheduling. Spectral-amplitude coding
(SAC) scheme [4,7–12] has emerged as a powerful technique
for OCDMA networks in recent years due to its ability to
eliminate MAI by preserving orthogonality among the sys-
tem users. SAC-OCDMA schemes are typically implemented
using broadband light sources (BLSs) such as light emitting
diodes (LEDs), super luminescence diodes (SLDs), or am-
plified spontaneous emission (ASE) light sources and optical
grating devices such as fiber-Bragg gratings (FBGs) or arrayed-
waveguide gratings (AWGs).
SAC-OCDMA is particularly suitable for RoF access sche-
me due to its asynchronous access capabilities, flexibility, secu-
rity, and transparency for various radio air interfaces. However,
RoF over SAC-OCDMA systems have three major drawbacks.
First, they are based on intensity modulation (IM) schemes,
and hence the network performance is limited by nonlineari-
ties (NLs) when analog time-varying radio signals modulated
by EOM with nonlinear BLSs. The nonlinear BLS can be non-
linearities in the curve for optical power output versus diode
current, and resulting in the intermodulation distortion and in-
terference. Second, beat noise such as phase-induced intensity
noise (PIIN) [8–12] will lead to a significant reduction in the
system performance. Third, previous AWG-based schemes suf-
fered a high crosstalk beat noise [10,13] as the number of active
users was increased. The crosstalk effect of AWG router can be
improved by employing one BLS in the coding system.
In applying the RoF technique, it is desirable to achieve a
seamless integration between the wired transport system and
the wireless radio-access system. A “double-spread CDMA”
can be accomplished by using an RF-CDMA layer for the ra-
dio signal and an OCDMA layer for the optical network. In this
double-spread CDMA scheme, RF-CDMA multiplexes the sig-
nals of the individual mobile units, while OCDMA multiplexes
the signals of the individual BSs, and the concept as shown in
Fig. 1.
In the double-spread CDMA system proposed in this study,
the RF-CDMA scheme is used to expand the spectrum of the
transmitted signals in the electrical domain. However, a nonlin-
ear effect occurs in the IM process when the RF-CDMA signals
are modulated into the optical network during the nonlinear
E-O process. To reflect the weak nonlinearity effect of BLSs in
the proposed system, the current analysis considers a Volterra
series comprising only a few Volterra Kernels (VKs) [14,15].
Since BLSs exhibit a weak nonlinearity when the current is
well above the threshold level, the analysis considers VKs of
lower orders. The nonlinearity of a BLS can be represented us-
ing a third-order polynomial without memory. Various papers
[3,16–19] have used RF-CDMA schemes within the electrical
domain to overcome the nonlinearity effect caused by nonlinear
optical sources in the optical domain.
Fig. 1. Concept of RoF over double-spread CDMA scheme.
Beat noise seriously impairs the network performance in the
optical domain. Since PIIN is proportional to the square of the
light intensity, simply increasing the transmitting power does
not improve the system performance. Conventional approaches
reduce the beating noise power by expanding the bandwidth
in the transmitter prior to optical modulation. Kajiya et al. [3]
employed the RF-CDMA scheme to suppress the interference
caused by optical beat noise in wavelength-division multiplex-
ing (WDM) systems. However, the effects of nonlinearity in a
double spread RF-CDMA/OCDMA scheme such as that con-
sidered in the present study have yet to be clarified.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents the proposed double-spread CDMA scheme for
RoF transmissions. We also illustrate an example of the encod-
ing/decoding process in Section 2. Section 3 develops analytical
formulations to evaluate the effect on the network performance
of nonlinearities of the optical sources and noise in the optical
domain, respectively. Section 4 presents the numerical evalu-
ation results for the proposed double spread system. Finally,
Section 5 gives some brief concluding remarks.
2. Proposed RoF over double-spread CDMA configuration
Fig. 2 presents a schematic representation of the AWG-based
encoder in the double-spread system. In the proposed system,
BS receives the RF-CDMA signals of M mobile units, and
OCDMA signals are transmitted from the BSs to the CS with
single-mode fiber. In the E-O IM process performed in the en-
coder, the RF-CDMA signals of each BS are used to modulate
a BLS whose spectrum is filtered for the one free spectral range
(FSR) of the AWG router. A common ASE source can be em-
ployed as BLS in the system.
The proposed OCDMA encoder and decoders employ a
SAC-OCDMA scheme with quasi-orthogonal M-sequence
codes over AWG routers rather than a conventional time-
division multiplexing (TDM) structure to separate the signals
from different BSs in order to suppress multiple-access inter-

each BS is assumed to be unity in the current analysis. In
this example, BS #2 and #5 do not transmit any radio signals.
BS #0 signal modulates the output of output port #0 of the
AWG encoder (i.e., C0 = (1,1,1,0,0,1,0) with central wave-
lengths λ1, λ2, λ3, and λ6). Due to the cyclic property of the
M-sequence code and the AWG router, C1 = (0,1,1,1,0,0,1)
with central wavelengths λ2, λ3, λ4, and λ7 appears at output
port #1 and is modulated by BS #1. Therefore, a total of seven
BSs can share a single AWG router in the encoder. Following
AWG encoding, the spectral signals are combined in the com-
biner and broadcast to the links connected to the decoders of
the CS in the network. The spectrum of the received signal, S,
is therefore the sum of the spectra of the individual BSs’ trans-
mitted signals spectrum, i.e.,
S = (s0, s1, . . . , sN−1) =
N−1∑
k=0
SkCk, (7)
where Sk is the signal spectrum of BS #k. In the example shown
in Table 1, the received signal spectrum S is equal to (2, 4, 3, 2,
3, 3, 3).
Fig. 4 presents a schematic illustration of the proposed AWG
router-based decoder in the CS. The splitter is connected to the
decoder’s AWG router pair, which distributes received signals
to the balanced photo-detectors of each BS to realize differen-
tial decoding. The CS use balanced photo-detectors to decode
the OCDMA signals received from the BSs and then decoded
RF-CDMA signals in mobile units. Finally, the RF-CDMA sig-
nals for the desired mobile unit are further extracted from the
decoded OCDMA BS signals. Similar to the connection from
the encoder router to the star coupler, connections from the star
coupler to the upper and lower AWGs are determined by the
C0 code word and its complementary code word C0, respec-
tively. The balanced photo-detector of BS #l will receive SCl
from the upper AWG and SCl from the lower AWG. After cor-
relation subtraction SCl −SCl is performed in the lth balanced
photo-detector, the RF-CDMA wave of BS #l is subsequently
recovered and other BSs’ interferences are rejected.
Tables 2 and 3 shows the wavelength distributions in the up-
per and lower AWG routers. As shown in Table 2, wavelength
chips #1, #2, #3, and #6 of the received signal S are obtained
at output port #0 of the upper AWG router from input ports #0,
#1, #2, and #5. The upper photodiode of CS decoder #0 there-
fore obtains SC0 = 12 units of energy. The remaining chips of
the received signal are obtained from input ports #3, #4, and
#6 of the lower AWG router, as shown in Table 3. In this case,
the lower photodiode of CS decoder #0 obtains SC0 = 8 units
of energy. Therefore, the differential detection process yields
a total of SC0 − SC0 = 4 units of energy. Applying the same
processes to CS decoder #5, the decoded energy is found to
be 0. Hence, the use of balanced photo-detectors enables the
MAI arising from other BSs to be canceled.
As shown in Fig. 5, after the optical decoding process, the
RF-CDMA signals are further decoded in the electrical do-
main by multiplying the signals by the RF-CDMA signature
codes for each mobile unit. Following digital demodulation,
the j th mobile unit signal in the CS decoder #l is finally ex-
tracted.
3. Performance analysis of double-spread CDMA RoF
transmissions
Consider the case shown in Fig. 3 where the j th RF signal
corresponding to mobile unit #j in BS #l modulates the coded
wavelengths from the lth AWG output port. The form of the
modulated BPSK signal of the j th mobile unit in BS #l is given
in Eq. (4). The nonlinearity optical field function can be mod-
eled by a third-order polynomial without memory [16,18], i.e.,

Based on these assumptions, the performance of the pro-

the average value of the parameter over wavelength, time, or

the light source, but also the distance traveled by the optical
signal in long haul network transmissions.
In Eq. (19), G(t, v) is assumed to be the single sideband in-
stantaneous PSD of the source. Since the noises at the upper
and lower photodiodes are independent, the power of the noise
sources in the output photocurrent can be written as (see Ap-

An assumption is made that the filter is perfectly matched
to the j th mobile unit in BS #l. Without loss of generality, τlj

PIIN increases. Fig. 7 shows that the system performance is
also degraded as the number of active mobile units’ increases.
In this case, the total number of the active BSs is 16 and the
RF-CDMA chip length at each BS is 511. The poorer system
performance is a result of an increased mobile unit interference
noise power; it will induce high MAI. The results indicate that
a BS can support at least 26 mobile units when the OMI, m0, is
equal to 0.35 at BER = 10−9.
Fig. 8 shows that the system performance can be improved
by increasing the chip length (i.e., increasing the PG) of the
RF-CDMA code. The total number of active mobile units and
BSs in this case is 16. This performance improvement arises
because a higher PG limits the MAI induced by the other mo-
bile units in the BS. In Fig. 8, we can find the optimal OMI
which yields the lowest BER, and this optimal OMI level is
less than m = 0.35. This is because higher OMI will induce

as Fig. 7. Significantly, by placing a scrambler (FIBERPRO
PS-155-A) in front of the balanced photo-detector to achieve
a DOP of P = 0.008, it is observed that the curve of P = 0.008
virtually overlaps that of the proposed RoF scheme with M-
sequence code in the ideal case (i.e., P = 0). Compared to the
average DOP of 0.5, the maximum permissible number of ac-
tive mobile units is improved by approximately 3% for a 10−9
error probability.
5. Conclusions
Radio-over-fiber system has prompted the development of
passive optical networks. The double-spread CDMA scheme
for RoF transmissions presented in this study performs SAC
method of a BLS in the wavelength domain and only requires
a single optical source connected to (N + 1)/2 input ports of
an AWG router to accomplish encoder of N BSs. By exploiting
the cyclic properties of M-sequence codes and AWG devices,
respectively, the proposed scheme requires just three AWG de-
vices to implement the coders/decoders. Furthermore, the use
of balanced photo-detectors in the decoders of the proposed
system cancels MAI between BSs in the optical domain, al-
though MAI may increase between mobile units following the
E-O nonlinear process.
The analytical results have shown that the PIIN increases
with an increasing number of active BSs since more wave-
lengths are required in the optical domain and depend on the
value of DOP. By introducing a scrambler in front of the bal-
anced photo-detector, the PIIN effect can be decreased. Further-
more, due to the nonlinearity of the optical source, the system
performance is reduced as a result of MAI when the number
of active mobile units in an BS increases. However, the system
performance can be improved by increasing the chip length of
the RF-CDMA code. Finally, the results have shown that the
performance of the proposed double-spread CDMA system is
highly sensitive to the value of the OMI. Therefore, for a given
number of users, an appropriate choice of the OMI value is
essential to ensure that the optimal system performance is ob-
tained.

the utilization of radio frequency spectrum in 
wireless networks. Built upon software-deﬁned 
radio, it combines wireless communications 
and mobile networking with signal processing, 
machine learning, optimization, and 
microeconomic models. In this tutorial, an 
intensive introduction to the dynamic spectrum 
access-based cognitive radio networks will 
be provided. Speciﬁcally, the basic concepts 
behind “cognitive radio” technology, basic 
functionalities in a cognitive radio transceiver 
for dynamic spectrum access, and different 
spectrum sharing models will be described. A 
survey on the spectrum sensing techniques and 
the medium access control (MAC)/rate-power 
control protocols will be presented. The key 
challenges, practical approaches, and open 
problems in these areas will be discussed. Also a 
brief summary on the ongoing standardization 
activities on cognitive radio will be provided.

T17: Channel Coding for IEEE 802.16e Mobile 
WiMAX 
Matthew C. Valenti, West Virginia University, 
Morgantown, WV
Room: Konferenz 2
As speciﬁed by the IEEE 802.16e-2005 
standard, Mobile WIMAX must use one of

convolutional code, a block turbo code 
(BTC), a convolutional turbo code (CTC), 
or a low-density parity-check code (LDPC). 
This tutorial will provide an overview of each 
of these categories of codes, highlighting 
their similarities and differences. The main 
focus will be on algorithms and architectures 
for encoding and decoding, as well as the 
speciﬁcs of the standard. Throughout the 
tutorial, encoding and decoding will be 
demonstrated within Matlab using a simulator 
developed by the instructor. The Matlab 
code is available for download by tutorial 
participants, so that they may leave the 
tutorial with a tangible set of tools.
T18: Self-organized Network Economics 
Sonja Buchegger, Deutsche Telekom 
Laboratories, Berlin
Room: Konferenz 3
Tools from economics and lessons from 
their applications in networking can help 
the networking community in both design 
and performance analysis. This tutorial 
gives an introduction to some of these tools 
and methods from economics and their 
applications to self-organized networks. 
Economics and network design have always 
been intimately intertwined. The infrastructural 
nature of networks, the decentralization of 
ownership and control, and the derivation 
of utility by heterogeneous users and 
applications, all point to the need for 
incorporating economic considerations into 
the design of networks

design. Networking in the near future is no 
more limited to “just” the provision of a 
communication infrastructure. This change 
in design will drastically augment with the 
foreseen emergence of the Internet of Things. 
It will connect a large amount of highly 
resource constrained, highly heterogeneous 
set of nodes ubiquitously communicating in 
a wireless fashion. The aim of this tutorial is to 
expose an industrial and academic audience 
to the cutting-edge R&D challenges 
associated with the protocol-related analysis 
and design of this disruptive technology.
