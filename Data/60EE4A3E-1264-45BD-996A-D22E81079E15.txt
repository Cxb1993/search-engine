英文摘要 
This is the final report for the two-year project. This project is aimed at using 
numerical methods to study the mixing flow in a vessel agitated by two different 
laminar impellers. The main concern of the first year is the screw impellers with a 
draught tube. The results were given in the mid-term report last year. A paper of this 
part of research has been published in ASME Journal of Fluids Engineering (vol. 130, 
pp. 041103.1-10), which is attached as an appendix in this report. The concern of the 
second year is the helical ribbon blade impellers. The main body of this final report, 
thus, only includes this part of research. 
 
Keywords: mixing flows, screw impellers, helical ribbon blade impellers

impeller, n the rotational speed and P the power consumption. A more common 
definition of the power number is 3 5/PN P n dρ= . These two dimensionless numbers 
are related by 
* Rep pN N=              (1) 
where 2Re /ndρ μ= is the Reynolds number. For low-Reynolds number flows the 
power consumption of the agitator is proportional to the square of the rotational speed. 
As a consequence, *pN is independent of rotational speed and becomes a constant. 
*
pN c=               (2) 
This relation is valid for Reynolds numbers less than about 40. The power 
number *pN is a function of the geometric configuration of the mixing system. Various 
correlations in terms of geometric variables have been proposed in a number of 
experimental studies [2-6]. 
 The mixing time is the time required for the flow to reach a certain level of 
homogeneity. It was revealed by experiments that the product of the mixing time tm 
and the rotational speed n, defining a dimensionless mixing time Km, is a constant. 
 m mK nt c= =              (3) 
Various methods, including conductivity techniques [7, 8], thermal techniques [9], 
coloration/decoloration techniques [10-12], and chemical reaction techniques [13, 14], 
etc, have been adopted to measure the mixing time. However, the determination of the 
degree of the mixing homogeneity depends on the techniques used. This results in 
considerable scatter in the constant, which makes the comparison of mixing 
performance difficult. 
  In addition to the mixing time, circulation time is also often employed as a 
criterion for evaluation of the mixing performance. It is the time for a fluid element to 
complete a vertical circulating loop in the vessel during the mixing process. It is 
generally recognized that the circulation time is proportional to the mixing time. 
Therefore, the dimensionless circulation Kc, defined as the product of the circulation 
time tc by the rotational speed, is also a constant for a specific mixing system. 
c cK nt c= =              (4) 
A direct way to find the circulation time is to follow the trajectory of a suspended 
particle [15-17]. Another means is taken from the periodicity of the response curve of 
a detector placed in the vessel [8, 9, 12, 14]. The dimensionless mixing time Km 
represents the number of revolutions of the impeller required to complete mixing and 
 5
computer time of the latter. In steady-state calculations, the impeller is frozen at a 
specific position without moving. To make the fluid flow, the volume swept by the 
impeller is mounted on a rotational frame. The body forces generated by the rotational 
frame trigger off fluid movement. As shown in Fig. 1, the vessel is divided into two 
parts. The inner part is stationary while a rotational frame is imposed on the outer part. 
The governing equations can be cast into the following dimensionless form.

where the coordinates jx , velocities jV and pressure p are non-dimensionalized by d,

to the rotational grid:

where jpqε is the alternating unit vector and pΩ the angular velocity of the impeller. It 
is noted that although a grid velocity is assigned to each node, the node itself is fixed 
at a specific position. 
The source term in the momentum equation represents the body forces induced 
by the rotation of the impeller and is ignored in the stationary frame. In the rotational 
frame, it can be expressed as

finite element method which adopts unstructured grids. However, with this method

where, see Fig. 2, the superscripts P and C denote the principal and the neighboring 
nodes sharing a common face f, and PCδ
G
 is a distance vector connecting these two 
nodes. The face gradient fφ∇  is obtained via interpolation from the gradients at the 
nodes P and C. 
 It needs to be noted that the difference equations for the nodes just next to the 
interface between the two reference frames include nodal velocities in the other frame. 
To correctly account for the momentum flux transported through the interface, the 
velocities at the other frame must be transformed onto the frame where the considered 
node is located. 
After discretization, the momentum equation can be solved to find velocities 
using prevailing pressure. However, the resulting velocity field does not satisfy the 
continuity and the pressure field needs to be updated. A pressure equation can be 
obtained by adjusting the velocities such that the continuity equation is satisfied in 
each cell. The solution procedure is to solve the momentum equation and the pressure 
equation in an iterative manner until convergence is reached. Details about the method 
can be found in references [24, 25]. 
With the velocity field obtained by the above method, the mixing of two fluids 
can be calculated by solving the following mass transport equation.

Schmidt number defined as Sc=ν/D, whereνis the kinematic viscosity and D the

Results and Discussion 
The arrangement of the mixing system has been given in Fig. 1. A basic 
configuration consists of a helical ribbon impeller of diameter d=330mm and a vessel 
of diameter D=337mm (D/d=1.0212). The ribbon blade is assumed to have a 
thickness of 5mm and a width w=0.1d. The height of the impeller is h=1d and that of 
the vessel is H=1.1d. Therefore, the clearance between the impeller and the wall of 
the vessel is C=0.0106d and the off-bottom clearance is h1= 0.05d. The impeller has a 
pitch S= 0.5d and a shaft of diameter ds=0.048d. The impeller rotates at a speed n=30

sides is approximately related to the pressure rise in the channel by the following 
equation. 
( ) ( ) cosout in z p s s zp p A p p A Fα− = − −         (16) 
where zA is the cross-sectional area, sA the side-wall area, and zF the axial component 
of the frictional force exerted on the channel walls. The relationship is obtained from 
the force balance for the channel in which the momentum fluxes are ignored. As a 
result of the pressure difference between the two sides of the blade, secondary 
vortices directing from the pressure side (the lower side of the blade) to the suction 
side (the upper side of the blade) are formed at the inner edge of the blade as observed 
in Fig. 3a. Fluid leak may be detected at the outer edge if the clearance between the 
blade and the wall of the vessel is large enough. The opening of the channel at the two 
edges results in decrease of the pressure difference on the two blade sides as well as 
the axial pressure gradient.  
Effects of impeller pitch 
 The influence of the impeller pitch on the power consumption is shown in Fig. 
5a. The power number *pN is large at small pitches. It falls quickly when the pitch is 
increased. It is followed by a gradual decrease at sufficiently large pitches. The power 
number approaches 160 as the pitch becomes infinite. Limited experimental data was 
provided by Käppel [6]. Similar trend between the present calculations and the 
measurements can be seen in the figure as S/d is enlarged from 0.5 to 1. The power 
consumed by the impeller can be divided into two parts, corresponding to the actions 
of the frictional force ( *,p fN ) and the pressure force (
*
,p pN ). At low values of pitch, i.e. 
at small values of pitch angleα in Fig. 4, the channel is elongated and the transverse 
width is reduced. The pressure difference between the two sides of the impeller blade 
becomes negligible because the transversal velocity component Vt is extremely small. 
The moving wall mainly drives the fluid to flow along the channel. As a consequence, 
large amounts of power are required to overcome the high frictional resistance. On the 
contrary, the flow driven by the wall is mainly in the transverse direction at large 
pitches, where the blade is in the vertical position at the limit of 900. Therefore, the 
flow in the vessel rotates with the impeller and the power exerted is simply used to 
overcome the pressure difference between the two sides of the impeller blade. There 
is a crossover of the two curves for *,p fN and
*
,p pN , which is located at about S/d=2.1. 
 The discharge flux induced by the impeller is defined as 
 11
measurements of Käppel [6], close agreement can be identified. The variation 
of *pN follows that of
*
,p fN closely. Also shown in the figure are the power numbers due 
to the contributions of the two working blade surfaces and the one facing the 
clearance gap. Although the area of the latter is much smaller than the two main ones, 
its contribution to the power number can not be ignored. Especially at small 
clearances, it is higher than those of the two working surfaces. The fast decline in the 
power number at low clearances is mainly ascribable to the quick decrease of this part 
because the strain rates generated by the rotating blade are greatly decreased. The part 
of power number due to the pressure force *,p pN also decreases, but at a slow rate, 
when the clearance is enlarged. This is resulted from the reduction of the pressure 
difference between the two blade sides. 
 As seen from Fig. 9b, the circulating flow rate is not much affected by the 
appearance of clearance. The circulation number slightly falls off for large clearances. 
It can be understood that the appearance of the clearance gap causes reduction of the 
pressure difference between the two blade sides. This, in turn, leads to decrease of the 
axial pressure gradient according to equation (16). As a consequence, the force to 
drive the fluid to flow upward in the central region of the vessel is reduced. 
Mixing performance 
 It can be drawn from the above results that the pitch and the width of the blade 
must be optimized for a large circulating flow rate and a lower power consumption. 
To support this point, the performances of two blade configurations are compared in 
the following. The first is the bnchmark one with pitch S=0.5d and width W=0.1d and 
the second is an optimized one with S=0.7d and W=0.25d. Initially, the volume of 
10% of the vessel height at the top is covered by a fluid with concentration C=1 and 
the rest is occupied by the other fluid with concentration C=0. The Schmidt number is 
assumed to be 1.6*107, which corresponds to that of glucose syrup. Calculations are 
conducted up to 200 revolutions. To measure the degree of mixing, a mixing index is 
defined by

where Ci is the concentration at a computational cell which has a volume vΔ , oiC  the 
initial value, totv  the total volume of the vessel. The summation is taken over all the 
cells of the vessel. This index becomes zero when the mixing is complete. It is evident 
from Fig. 10 that the performance of the optimum configuration is much superior to 
 13
the blade. 
2. The pitch of the blade has a significant influence on the performance of the mixer. 
When the pitch decreases, the velocity component of the moving wall to drive the 
flow along the channel is increased. However, the channel is lengthened and the 
cross-sectional area is decreased, resulting in increase of flow resistance. 
Therefore, to have a better design the pitch needs to be optimized. For the 
configurations considered in this study this value falls in the range S=0.7d to 0.9d. 
3. At small values of blade width, the discharge flow rate increases with the width. 
However, as the width becomes sufficiently large, the reverse flow in the central 
region of the vessel will extend into the blade channel because this open space is 
limited. Thus, the flow rate is reduced. The optimum blade width in the present 
study is in the range W=0.21d to 0.26d.  
4. The enlargement of the clearance gap results in large reduction of power 
consumption, but has little effect on the circulating flow rate. However, the fluid 
in the clearance region is difficult to be mixed with the other fluid if the clearance 
is large. 
5. It was demonstrated that after the width and the pitch of the impeller blade are 
optimized, the circulating flow rate is largely increased, resulting in significant 
decrease of mixing time. Besides, the power consumption is also reduced. It was 
also seen that by enlarging the clearance gap, it is difficult for the fluid in the 
clearance region to be well mixed.

Mixing Flow Characteristics in a
Vessel Agitated by the Screw
Impeller With a Draught Tube
The circulating flow in a vessel induced by rotating impellers has drawn a lot of interests
in industries for mixing different fluids. It used to rely on experiments to correlate the
performance with system parameters because of the theoretical difficulty to analyze such
a complex flow. The recent development of computational methods makes it possible to
obtain the entire flow field via solving the Navier–Stokes equations. In this study, a
computational procedure, based on multiple frames of reference and unstructured grid
methodology, was used to investigate the flow in a vessel stirred by a screw impeller
rotating in a draught tube. The performance of the mixer was characterized by circula-
tion number, power number, and nondimensionalized mixing energy. The effects on these
dimensionless parameters were examined by varying the settings of tank diameter, shaft
diameter, screw pitch, and the clearance between the impeller and the draught tube. Also
investigated was the flow system without the draught tube. The flow mechanisms to cause
these effects were delineated in detail. DOI: 10.1115/1.2903815
1 Introduction
The process of fluid mixing is commonly used in industries. To
blend different fluids, a vessel is equipped with a rotational im-
peller. A swirling flow, i.e., a flow rotating about the vessel axis, is
generated by the impeller. The function of the impeller is to en-
sure transport of a fluid element to anywhere in the tank. In order
to fulfill this objective, axial vortices, i.e., loop flows circulating
from the top region of the tank to the bottom region, must be
induced. Thus, the flow in the tank is inevitably three dimensional.
The contact surfaces between different fluids are then deformed
by the three-dimensional flow. Since different fluid materials are
mixed in the interface layer via molecular diffusion, the deformed
and, thus, elongated contact surface leads to the enhancement of
fluid mixing.
For low-viscosity fluids, the most commonly used impellers are
the disk-type flat blade turbines and the pitched-blade turbines 1.
The low viscosity of the fluids and the smaller size, compared
with the tank, render the turbine impellers suitable for high-speed
rotation, which makes the flow field turbulent. Turbulent flows are
helpful in fluid mixing because the contact surfaces between dif-
ferent fluids are greatly wrinkled by the turbulence fluctuations. At
higher viscosities, these impellers lose their effectiveness due to
the difficulty to achieve high shear conditions because large power
consumption is demanded. Instead, helical ribbon impellers or
screw impellers, rotating at low speeds, are preferred.
The screw impeller, despite its small diameter, produces signifi-
cant secondary circulation when incorporating a draught tube and
is the main concern of the present study. This mixer works in a
similar manner to the screw extruder. However, the former func-
tions to maximize pumping flow with a low pressure increase,
whereas the latter works to maximize pressure rise with a low
pumping capacity. In the past, most analyses of the pumping flow
in the screw mixer are based on an analogy to the extruder. As
seen in Refs. 2,3, the flow in a tube pumped by a screw can be
mainly divided into a drag flow qd and a pressure flow qp,
q = qd − qp 1
The drag flow qd resulting from the relative motion between the
screw and the casing is a forward flow in the positive direction of
the axis. It was treated as a fully developed flow between two
parallel plates with one plate moving at the rotational speed to
drive the fluid flow, which is similar to the well-known Couette
flow. When the screw pump operates, pressures builds up in the
pump, resulting in a high pressure at the outlet. The adverse pres-
sure gradient brings about a back flow in the negative direction of
the axis. This pressure flow qp can be analyzed by assuming a
Poiseuille flow between the plates.
The above simple models were also used to estimate power
requirements. The power consumed by the drag flow is obtained
via calculating the internal heat generation due to viscous dissipa-
tion. Both the flows in the channel direction and in the transverse
direction need to be taken into consideration in estimating the
energy dissipation. For the pressure flow, the power required is the
power expended as flow energy in raising the pressure of the fluid,
which is equal to the product of the pressure rise in the screw
pump and the maximum pumping flow rate corresponding to zero
pressure gradients.
For the pressure flow, the pressure rise between the inlet and the
outlet of the screw pump needs to be known. In general, the pres-
sure rise is determined from experiments. However, Sykora 4
used the frictional loss in the flow through the annular span be-
tween the draught tube and the tank to estimate this pressure rise.
To account for the effects of the side walls and the curvature of
the flow channel in the pump at low helical angles, shape factors
were introduced 2,3.
In the past, most studies were done to correlate three key char-
acteristic parameters power number, mixing time, and circulation
number to geometric parameters, such as the tank diameter, the
length of the screw, the pitch of the impeller, and the width of the
impeller blade 4–10. These correlations were expressed in di-
mensionless form to generalize their applicability. When geomet-
ric configurations are fixed, the dependence of the three charac-
teristic parameters on the rotational speed of the screw impeller
n or the Reynolds number Re can be summarized for Newton-
ian fluids as

The convective value  f through each face is approximated by
a high-order scheme,
 f = UD + 
UD ·  10
where the superscript UD denotes the value evaluated at a node
upstream of the face under consideration and  is the distance
vector directed from the upwind node to the centroid of the face.
In the equation,

0 and 1. For a value of 0, it simply degenerates into the upwind
difference scheme. For 
=1, the scheme is second order accurate.

where see Fig. 2 the subscripts P and C denote the principal and
the neighboring nodes sharing a common face f , and PC is a
distance vector connecting these two nodes. The face gradient
 f is obtained via interpolation from the gradients at the two
nodes.
In solving the discretized transport equations, the first terms on
the right-hand side in Eqs. 10 and 11 are implicitly treated,
while the second terms in the equations are tackled in an explicit
manner using the deferred-correction procedure. It also needs to
be noted that the computational molecules for the nodes in one
frame immediately adjacent to the interface between the two ref-
erence frames include nodal points in the other frame. To correctly
evaluate the momentum flux transported through the interface, the
velocities at these neighboring nodes must be transformed onto
the frame where the considered node is located.
After solving momentum equations, the resulting velocities
must be adjusted, and the prevailing pressure must be upgraded in
a way that the continuity equation is satisfied. The enforcement of
conservation of mass results in a pressure-correction equation.
The discretized momentum equations and the pressure-correction
equation are sequentially solved in an iterative manner. Iterations
are performed to account for the nonlinearities, the coupling be-
tween velocities and pressure, and the deferred-correction terms
mentioned above. More details about the method can be found in
Refs. 14,16.
3 Results and Discussion
A drawing of the mixing system with a screw-in-a-tube agitator
is given in Fig. 1. A benchmark configuration of the mixing sys-
tem has a screw impeller with diameter d=126 mm and length
h=1.5d. The diameter D and the height H of the agitated tank are
D=H=2.3d. The screw impeller has a shaft of diameter dS
=0.254d and a clearance C=0.05d. The pitch of the screw impel-
ler is S=0.6d. The width of the screw blade W is equal to d
−dS /2, and the distances between the impeller and both the top
and the bottom of the tank are h1= H−h /2. The impeller rotates
at a speed of 59 rpm, which is equivalent to a Reynolds number of
1.52.
To generate unstructured grids, the computational domain is
first divided into 80 blocks. In each block, an algebraic method is
used to create a suitable grid. After the grids for all the blocks are
constructed, the grid nodes are readdressed. An example of the
resulting mesh is presented in Fig. 3. To examine grid effects on
the mixing flow performance, grids with about 120,000, 200,000,
300,000, and 380,000 cells have been tested. It was found that the
power number defined by Eq. 14 gradually increases with the
cell number from 287 to 301.6. However, the difference between
the two finest grids is only 0.4%. The circulation number defined
by Eq. 12 is less sensitive to the choice of grid. It varies from
0.196 for the coarsest grid to 0.193 for the other grids. In the
following, the grid with about 380,000 cells is adopted for calcu-
lations. The no-slip conditions are imposed on all the surfaces of
the system. The flow in the vessel is assumed to be motionless as
the initial condition.
The flow field, illustrated in Fig. 4, shows that fluid is drawn by
the rotating impeller into the draught tube from the upper opening
and emerges from the bottom end, followed by an upward flow
outside the tube to complete a circulation loop. To validate the
methodology, calculations have been conducted to compare with
the measurements of Seichter et al. 8 and Seichter 9. In the
experiments, the liquids to be mixed were solutions of starch
syrup in water, which exhibit a Newtonian behavior. The flow
velocities were measured using a thermal resistor. To measure the
torque, the mixing vessel was placed on a turntable. The torque
produced by the rotating impeller was transmitted to a silon thread
and compensated on a desk balance. There are two major differ-
ences between the experiments and the simulations. One is that
the thickness of the impeller is not given in the experiments.
Therefore, a guessed value for the thickness was used in simula-
tions. The other is the upper surface of the flow in the vessel,
which is open to air. However, it is assumed to be a solid wall in
calculations. A comparison of the axial velocity in the annular

It is noted that in the equation, NP
* /NQ represents the power re-
quired per unit of circulating flow. It can be used as an indicator
for pumping effectiveness 15 but is not suitable for mixing ef-
fectiveness because the geometric size of the tank needs to be
taken into account in the mixing process.
3.1 Effects of Tank Diameter. To examine the influence of
the relative size of the stirred tank to the impeller, the diameter of
the tank is gradually enlarged, while those of both the screw im-
peller and the draught tube remain unchanged. Its effects on the
pumping capacity, power consumption, and mixing effectiveness
are illustrated in Figs. 6a–6c. In the figures, two sets of calcu-
lations corresponding to cases with a constant impeller shaft
ds /d=0.254, where d is fixed and a variable shaft ds /D=0.11
are presented. In the constant shaft case, the pump configuration is
fixed, while the pump shaft diameter ds will be increased with the
enlarged tank in the variable shaft case. The inclusion of the latter
is simply used to compare with the experiments of Seichter et al.
8 and the predictions of Kuncewicz et al. 12 because there are
no data available for the former case for comparison. Considering
the case with a fixed shaft, for small values of D close to d, the
circulating flow rate NQ is small because of the great frictional
resistance of the narrow passage between the draught tube and the
tank wall. The flow rate quickly builds up when the annular space
is enlarged to D /d=2.3, followed by leveling off to a value of
NQ=0.35. Theoretically, the power number NP
* is maximized as
the tank diameter is reduced to the tube diameter because a very
high pressure gradient is generated, but without any fluid flow.
When the tank diameter is increased, the power requirement de-
creases sharply and then NP
* reaches nearly a constant value of
225 after D becomes larger than 2.3d. Also shown in Fig. 6b are
the two parts of power number due to the pressure force NP,p
* 
and the frictional force NP,f
* . For small tank diameters, NP,p
*
quickly decreases and NP,f
* gradually increases. Both are attributed
to the release of the flow in the annular region as D /d increases.
At large diameters, power consumption is mainly attributed to the
frictional loss, which is about three times the pressure loss. Figure
6c illustrates that the energy required for mixing is reduced first
and then quickly increases when the tank is enlarged. There exists
a minimum point at D /d=2. This value is smaller than the value
of 2.3 at which the circulating flow rate becomes nearly a maxi-
mum and the power consumption a minimum. The results can be
understood in view of Eq. 18 in which the mixing energy is
proportional to D3.
For the variable shaft case with ds /D=0.11, the flow channel in
the draught tube is narrowed as the shaft diameter increases with
the enlarged tank, resulting in a reduction in NQ and an increase in
NP
* when D is greater than 2.3d. A similar trend for NQ can be
found in the results of Kuncewicz et al. 12. However, the power
number NP
* increases with increasing D in the present calculations
for D greater than 2.3d but continues to decrease in the calcula-
tions of Kuncewicz et al. It will be shown in Sec. 3.2 that an
increase in shaft diameter will cause an increase in frictional force
on the shaft surface, which leads to a large frictional loss. There-
fore, the predictions of Kuncewicz et al. are not reliable. The
cause of the decreasing behavior is thought to be due to their
calculation procedure. As mentioned in the Introduction, in their
two-dimensional calculations, two drag coefficients need to be
specified to account for the action forces by the impeller. These
coefficients were determined by some pilot tests to fit the experi-
mental data and then used throughout the rest of the calculations.
It is conjectured that these coefficients may require adjustment for
the cases with large D /d. This may explain why their results have
a good agreement with the measurements at low values of D /d.
The experimental data of Seichter et al. 8 are also included in
the figures. There exist some differences between the present
predications and the measurements. It needs to be emphasized that

tion Vw sin . A pressure rise between the inlet and the outlet is
built up by the channel-direction flow and a pressure difference
between the side walls by the transverse flow. These two pressure
differences are related by considering the axial component of the
force balance over the entire channel,
pout − pinAz = pp − psAs cos  − Fz 19
where pin and pout are the pressures at the inlet and the outlet, pp
and ps are the pressures at the pressure side and the suction side,
Az is the cross-sectional area, As is the sidewall area, and Fz is the
axial component of the frictional force exerted on the channel
walls. In the equation, the momentum difference between the inlet
and the outlet is neglected. It is obvious that the pressure differ-
ence between the sidewalls is linearly related to the pressure rise
through the draught tube. As an illustration, the pressure contours
distributed on the impeller shaft are presented in Fig. 10. The
dimensionless average pressures at the inlet and exit of the tube
are pin=91.6 and pout=100.8, while those on the two sides of the
blade are pp=104 and ps=87.9. As a result, the pressure rise
through the tube is pin− pout=9.2 and the pressure difference be-
tween the two blade sides is pp− ps=16.1. It is noted that there
exists a high pressure zone at the leading edge of the blade at the
entrance and a low pressure zone at the trailing edge at the exit.
Near these two regions, reversed flows may result. However, its
effect on the primary flow structure is insignificant.
The pitch, or the helical angle , has two opposite effects on the
flow. As seen in Fig. 9, by decreasing the helical angle, the veloc-
ity component of the moving wall in the channel direction is in-
creased, being helpful to the fluid flow. However, the channel is
narrowed and lengthened, resulting in greater frictional resistance.
Hence, there exists an optimum pitch value for maximum flow. It
is observed in Fig. 11a that this optimum value holds at S /d
=1.5 in the present computations. For the two limiting cases with
=0 deg and 90 deg, i.e., S /d=0 and , there is no flow through
the draught tube because in the former the impeller degenerates
into a rotating cylinder, whereas in the latter the impeller blade
becomes vertical. For the rotating cylinder case, a large amount of
power is required to overcome the great frictional resistance that
is prevailing. As shown in Fig. 11b, the power requirement
quickly decreases first, followed by leveling off to a constant
value. When S is greater than 1.5d, the constant value of NP
* is 226
for S /d=. It is also shown in the figure that the pressure part of
the power number NP,p
* gradually approaches 226 while the fric-
tional part NP,f
* gradually approaches zero. For the limiting case of
the vertical blade, transverse flow prevails in the draught tube,
which generates large pressure difference between the two side-
walls. The variation of mixing energy in Fig. 11c shows that the
most efficient mixing occurs when S /d=1.5.

consumption. Either the circulation number or the power
number nearly reaches a constant for D2.3d. However, in
terms of the total energy required for mixing, the optimum
size of the tank occurs at D=2d.
2 The increase in the shaft diameter leads to a decrease in
channel height and, thus, reduction in fluid flow. The power
requirement remains nearly a constant until ds=0.6d. It is
followed by an increase in power consumption due to the
enhanced frictional force near the shaft surface.
