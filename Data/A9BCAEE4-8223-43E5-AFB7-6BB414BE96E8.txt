Ceramics with the composition of (Bi0.5Na0.5)0.94Ba0.06ZryTi1−yO3
[abbreviated as BNBZ100yT], in which y =0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 were prepared by solid
state reaction method. X-ray diffraction studies revealed the perovskite structure in
BNBZ100yT ceramics sintered at 1170 °C for 2 h in air. The temperature dependent
dielectric properties of BNB6T and BNB6Z4T ceramics showed relaxor-like behavior.
Decreases in remanent polarization, coercive field, and disappearance of piezoelectric
properties were found by the substitution of 2 and 4 mol % Zr4+ for Ti4+ in these
ceramics. Electron diffraction patterns taken in a transmission electron microscope
demonstrated the existence of cubic crystalline phase in the BNB6Z4T ceramics
leading to the disappearance of piezoelectric property. Decrease in grain size was also
observed with the substitution of Zr4+ for Ti4+ in BNB6T ceramics. The results
indicates that the substation of Zr4+ for Ti4+ at B-site has played a significant role in
reducing the piezoelectric properties in the present system.
Material system-2
The ceramics with the composition of Bi0.5(Na0.82-xK0.18Lix)0.5]TiO3
(BNKLT) ceramics with x =0, 0.05 0.075 and 0.1 were prepared by the solid state
reaction method. X-ray diffraction studies showed the existence of rhombohedral and
tetragonal phases related to MPB region. Li doped BNKT ceramics exhibited higher
planar mode electromechanical coupling factor and ferroelectric properties than that
of pure BNKT ceramics. XPS core level spectra analysis showed the existence of
metallic Bi in pure BNKT. DC conductivity measurement confirmed the existence of
bismuth metal by showing highest conductivity, implying that metallic Bi may cause
larger leakage current. But the addition of Li+ for Na+ at A-site in BNKT suppressed
the formation of metallic bismuth. AC impedance spectroscopic study for BNKT
specimens with Li content of x=0.075 exhibited lowest grain conductivity, whereas
grain conductivity is high in BNKT ceramic. TEM-EDS analysis also showed less
atomic percentage of Na and K which might be attributed to evaporation of Na and K
elements that results in defects of metallic elements and/or ionic vacancies.
Introduction
Recently, various lead-free piezoelectric solid solutions with a perovskite
structure, such as KNbO3, B1/2K1/2TiO3, BaTiO3 and Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-based ceramics
have been widely studied [1-11]. There are also many patents applied simultaneously.
BNT based ceramics are found highly promising lead-free piezoelectric materials due
1 4
specimens, measured properties, and employed AC impedance spectroscopy,
transmission electron microscopic techniques and micro-composition analysis to
analyze material characteristics.
Intriguing topics such as defect formation and characteristics in lead-free
ferroelectric materials, domain dynamics and microstructural features corresponding
to structural distribution, which may all correlated with material properties are under
investigations.
Research Methods and analysis of procured data
(i) Synthesis and characterization of BNBZ100yT with y =0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04
ceramics
The conventional mixed oxide technique was used to prepare the different
amount of ZrO2 containing (Bi0.5Na0.5)0.94Ba0.06ZryTi1−yO3 ceramics [BNB6Z100yT]
with y=0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04. The oxides and carbonate starting powders were mixed
according to the desired chemical formula and milled in ethanol using ZrO2 balls for
10 h and then calcined at 850 °C for 2 h. After calcination, the mixture was milled in
the same condition as above and dried at 80 °C for 24 h, followed by adding polyvinyl
alcohol as a binder for granulation. The compacted disks were sintered at 1170 °C for
2 h in air. The structure and morphology were investigated using x-ray diffraction
[XRD Rigaku RINT-2000], scanning electron microscope [SEM-Hitachi s-4700], and
high resolution transmission electron microscope [JEOL-2010]. The capacitance of
the ceramics used for calculating dielectric constant was measured as a function of
frequency and temperature using HP4194A impedance analyzer. Precision work
station 2000 [Radiant] was used to measure polarization hysteresis loops. The sintered
ceramics for piezoelectric measurements were poled in silicon oil at 80 °C under 4.5
kV/mm for 10 min. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 was measured using a Channel
CADT-3300 meter.
XRD patterns of BNB6Z100yT with y=0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 ceramics exhibited
pure perovskite structure (Figure A-1). The structure of BNT is found rhombohedral.
With the incorporation of 6 mol % of BaTiO3 i.e., BNB6T, the crystal structure
transformed from rhombohedral into a tetragonal symmetry with the splitting of (200)
and (002) peaks at around 2of 46.5°. Hence, the x-ray diffraction patterns of
BNB6T ceramic indicate the coexistence of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. The
crystal of BNB6Z4T ceramic structure shows tetragonal symmetry feature with (111)
peaks at around 2of 40°.
The temperature dependence of dielectric constant of BNB6T and BNB6Z4T
samples at various frequencies had shown relaxor-like behavior (Figure A-2). At low
frequencies, a phase transition from ferroelectric to anti-ferroelectric is observed at
1 6
Transmission electron microscopy was used to observed the type of phase
transition occurs during Zr4+ substitution for Ti4+ at B-site in BNB6Z4T (Figure A-1b).
The diffraction pattern has shown the existence of cubic phase. This might be due to
decrease in B-site deviated distance by moving atoms to body centered location, thus
making piezoelectric properties to disappear by the substation of Zr4+ for Ti4+.
Scanning electron micrographs of BNB6T ceramics reveal the decrease in grain size
by the substitution of Zr4+ for Ti4+ at lower content, and again increase in grain size at
higher content. This observation is thought to be due to the phase transition from
tetragonal to cubic state.
(ii) Synthesis and characterization of BNKLyT with y =0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1
ceramics
Conventional sintering process was adopted to synthesize
[Bi0.5(Na0.82-xK0.18Lix)0.5]TiO3 ceramics with x =0, 0.05 0.075 and 0.1. Raw
materials of Bi2O3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, TiO2, and Li2CO3 with high purities (99.9%)
were used to prepare the ceramics. Similar procedure was followed as mentioned for
the BNBZT system with calcinations temperature of 850oC for 2 hrs and sintering
temperature of 1150oC for 2hrs. In addition to the above experimental techniques,
XPS and AC impedance spectroscopy methods were also used to identify the
chemical composition and the role of defect concentration on the properties.
X-ray diffraction patterns reveal two phases with rhombohedral and tetragonal
which are clearly observed between 2 theta of 46o-48o with curve fitting analysis to
understand the content of rhombohedral and tetragonal phase (Figure B-1). This result
points out that Li diffuse into the BNKT lattice to form a solid solution and due to
valence number of Li+, it tends to enter into location of A-site. The ratios of the
measured densities to the theoretical densities of the sintered ceramics were all higher
than 97%. With increasing atomic faction of Li, the relative density of BNKLT
ceramics significantly increases up to x=0.075 and then decreased slightly with
further increase of Li content. This might be explained by the fact that the melting
point of Li2CO3 is lower than that of Na2CO3 and K2CO3. With the addition of Li2CO3
to BNKT as a sinter-aid, it will promote formation of liquid phase during sintering
and increase densification of ceramics. Generally, Li free BNT based ceramics can be
sintered to obtain near theoretical densities at 1175oC-1250oC for 2h. The addition of
Li significantly improves the sintering performance, decreases the sintering
temperature of BNKT ceramics. This might be explained by the fact that due to
binding energy of Li-O is lower than that of Na-O and K-O and when Li content is
beyond 0.05, tolerance factor is found to decrease indicating the decrease in stability.
The ferroelectric property of BNKLT ceramics shows that the remanent
1 8
element in BNKLT ceramics significantly displays more uniform distribution than in
pure BNKT ceramics. But sodium and potassium content are all lower than theoretical
value. This proves sodium and potassium easily to evaporate. Comparing with
BNKLT and pure BNKT ceramics, lack of sodium and potassium content in pure
BNKT ceramics are more significant than in BNKLT ceramics. It implies that the
addition of Li to BNKT can restrain evaporation of sodium and potassium from
specimen and reduces the defect concentration.
AC impedance plots (Cole-Cole) of BNKLT system of ceramics show
semicircular arcs (Figure B-4a). These arcs can be formulated from the complex
impedance plane, where the equation=2fmax*RC=1 should be satisfied at the peak
maximum of each semicircles. As expected, the area enclosed by the semicircle keeps
decreasing with increasing temperature. However, the decrement is found pronounced,
despite the fact that the increment in temperature is 50oC for each semicircle plotted.
This indicates that the impedance of the sample is changing drastically with
temperature despite the temperature being fairly high. As the temperature increases,
these semicircles are resolved into two semicircles intercepting each other on the
X-axis. The appearance of two semicircles in Cole-Cole plots indicates that there are
two relaxation mechanisms. These two relaxation mechanisms are due to grain and
grain boundary. A series array of two parallel RC circuits is found the best fit to the
experimental data in the temperature range 600-700oC. The angle of deviation is very
small and confirming that the distribution of grains in the sample is uniform. The
resistance of pure BNKT is 10,000 at 700oC. With the addition of Li to BNKT, the
resistance increased significantly, indicating the homogeneity and uniform
microstructure with higher density and better performance compared to pure BNKT.
The structural changes and compositional variations in the samples will be important
for the observed behavior. Two semicircles were observed in all compositions, in
which the resistance of high frequency semicircle is larger than low frequency
semicircle. The resistance of grains and grain boundaries were estimated using
Cole-Cole plots and conductivities of grains and grain boundaries were calculated.
Higher grain and grain boundary conductivity is observed in pure BNKT, which
implies that Bi metal played an important role in leakage current. Lowest grain
conductivity is observed in BNKT specimen with Li content of x=0.075. Activation
energies for grain and grain boundary conduction were calculated from the fitted
graphs of conductivity versus 1000/T (Figure B-4b). The activation energy for the
pure BNKT specimen [g-1.26eV, gb-1.229eV] is larger than that of Li doped BNKT
specimens[g-0.764eV, gb-0.751eV]. The higher activation energy in pure BNKT can
be explained by compositional or random local electric fields due to Na+1, K+1, Bi+3
and ions distributed randomly at A-site. It is known that Bi2O3 is volatilizable at
1 10
observed in BNKT specimen with Li content of x=0.075, whereas it is high in
BNKT ceramic. TEM-EDS analysis also shows that less atomic percentage of
Na and K elements. This might be attributed to evaporation of Na and K
elements and this might result in defects of metallic elements and/or ionic
vacancies..
