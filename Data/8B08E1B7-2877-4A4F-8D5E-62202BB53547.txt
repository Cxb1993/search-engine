I. Introduction 
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major air pollutants in industrial 
processes and environmental activities which must be controlled under stringent 
environmental regulations in many countries. There are commercialized VOCs 
control technologies such as combustion, adsorption, absorption, biofiltration, and 
catalytic oxidation.  And adsorption is one of the most widely employed methods in 
practical industrial operation because of the easy operation and low cost with efficient 
recovery of most VOCs (Ruhl, 1993). Porous adsorbents such as activated carbon 
(AC) and zeolite are commercially available for VOCs treatment. And new 
silica –based mesoporous silica materials such as MCM-41 have been widely studied 
on adsorption of VOCs (Zhao et al., 2001). 
The silica-based mesoporous materials have been received much attention on 
developing and altering their synthesis and morphology since its discovery by Mobil 
Corporation in 1992 (Beck et al., 1992). They have potential applications in several 
fields such as adsorption, ion exchange, catalysis, chromatography, and sensing 
(Tanchoux et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2001). In the field of adsorption application, 
mesoporous materials are very interesting candidates as regenerative adsorbents for 
abating air and water pollutant. 
Several pathways are known for synthesis of mesoporous materials. These 
materials are typically synthesized by conventional hydrothermal treatment methods 
which are time-consumed. The MCM-41 material is one of the popular products made 
by the conventional hydrothermal method. A new method of evaporation induced 
self-assembly (EISA) for synthesizing ordered mesoporous silica particles (MSPs) 
was developed by Lu et al. (1999). It is a continuous and rapid process and the 
atomized into aerosol droplets and the surfactant molecules start to be self-assembled 
as the solvent of droplets evaporate. Meanwhile, the inorganic condensation is 
achieved via sol-gel process. Finally, the mesoporous silica structured particles is 
obtained after the removal of surfactant molecules.

2.2  MSPs fabrication procedure and devices 
Fig. 2 shows the experimental set-up for the preparation of MSPs adsorbents via 
EISA method. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as the 
structure-directing template and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as the silica 
precursor. The molar gel composition of the synthesized mixture was TEOS: x CTAB: 
10 Ethanol: 40 H2O: 0.008 HCl (x varies from 0.06 to 0.26). The reagents were 
mixed and nebulized by an ultrasonic atomizer and carried by a high pressure, clean 
and dry air flow. Then the reagent flow was passed through a high temperature tubular 
reactor with two heating zones. The total flow rate was set at 2.0 LSTPmin-1.  
metasilicate nanohydrate was dissolved in 80 ml DI water and the resulting solution 
was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. Then approximately 40 ml of 4N H2SO4 was 
added to the above mixture to bring down the pH to 10.5 with constant stirring to 
form a gel. After stirring, 7.28 g of CTAB (dissolved in 25 ml of DI water) was added 
slowly into the above mixture and the combined mixture was stirred for three 
additional hours. The resulting gel mixture was transferred into a Teflon coated 
autoclave and kept in an oven at 145oC for 36 hours. After cooling to the room 
temperature, the resultant solid was recovered by filtration, washed with DI water and 
dried in an oven at 110oC for 8 hours. Finally, the organic template was removed by 
calcination using a muffle furnace in air at 550oC for 10 hours. The total synthesis 
time for the Si-MCM-41 by hydrothermal method was about 60 hours. 
2.4 Characterization of adsorbents 
Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of the synthesized materials were 
measured at -196oC using a surface area and pore diameter distribution analyzer 
(Micromertitics, ASAP 2020, USA). Prior to the adsorption-desorption measurements, 
the samples were degassed at 350oC for 6 hours under vacuum pressure of 10-6 mbar. 
The powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of MSPs and Si-MCM-41 materials 
were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX-B diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα 
radiation at λ = 1.54 Å. The diffractograms of the MSPs and Si-MCM-41 were 
recorded in the 2θ range of 2-10o with steps of 0.6 degree and a count time of 60s at 
each point. The surface morphology of MSPs and Si-MCM-41 was characterized 
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H7100 and JEOL JEM 1210, 
Japan). The TEM samples (5-10 mg) were ultrasonicated in ethanol solution and the 
resulting suspensions were dispersed on carbon film supported 200 mesh copper grids. 
 III. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Synthesis of MSPs adsorbents and VOCs adsorption performance  
3.1.1 Characterization of MSPs adsorbents 
The synthesized samples are denoted as S-X, where X corresponds to the 
precursor molar ratio of CTAB surfactant to TEOS silica source (Surf/Si). For 
example, S06 and S26 indicated that the adsorbent samples were prepared under 
Surf/Si molar ratios of 0.06 and 0.26, respectively. 
The TEM images of MSPs adsorbents produced at various Surf/Si molar ratios 
are shown in Fig. 3. The surface texture of S06 illustrated in Fig. 3(a) shows rough 
surface structure with irregular pores. The formation of less ordered mesopores at low 
surfactant concentration may be due to that CTAB surfactant concentration could not 
thoroughly overtake the critical micelle concentration (CMC) during the evaporation 
process (Baccile et al., 2003). 
The TEM images of S12 and S18 samples shown in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), 
respectively, indicated that these two adsorbent samples have better ordered pore 
structures. In the Surf/Si molar ratio region of 0.12~0.18, the CMC of forming rod 
shape micelles can be achieved during alcohol and water evaporation so that ordered 
2D-hexagonal structure can be formed. And the hexagonal structure of the samples 
can be clearly observed in the enlarge TEM images of Fig. 3(b-2) and 3(c-2). The 
mesoporous order is constructed of either arranged hexagonal spots (i.e. tubular pores 
perpendicular to the particle surface) or tubular pores parallel to the particle surface. 
This observation is similar to that in the literature (Bore et al., 2003). The MSP 
during the surfactant removal. Another reason to explain less-ordered pore structure is 
the formation of new shape micelles such as vesicles and reverse micelles which 
decrease the uniformity during self-assembly of micelles (Baccile et al., 2003; Bore et 
al., 2003).  
The mesoporous structures of the samples were confirmed by X-ray diffraction 
patterns as shown in Fig. 4. The (100) diffraction peaks located at about 2θ = 2.3° ~ 
2.7° are more clearly observed for samples prepared under Surf/Si molar ratio of 
around 0.12 ~ 0.18. This reveals the evidence of more ordered mesoporous structure. 
One can also seen from Fig. 4 that the XRD peaks tend to be shifted to larger angles 
as the Surf/Si molar ratio is increased, which leads to the decreases of d-spacing 
values, i.e. center-to-center pore distance.  
The intensities of diffraction peak for S12~S18 samples are higher than that of 
S22 sample which means the uniformity of meso-pores and the order of structure for 
Surf/Si=0.12~0.18 are better. The presence of broadening and reduction in the 
intensity of diffraction peak for S22 sample further confirms the collapse of some 
pores and thus leads to the less ordered mesoporous structure. Both a further increase 
of the Surf/Si molar ratio beyond 0.22 and a decrease of Surf/Si molar ratio below 
0.10 result in the flattening of XRD peaks at 2θ = 2.3° ~ 2.7°. This is consistent with 
the TEM images shown in Figure 3.  
 
isotherm curve appears to be type I isotherm based on the IUPAC classification, 
which is typical of microporous structure. 
Fig. 6 shows the BJH pore size distributions of S06~S26 samples. The BJH pore 
size distributions of all samples except S26 display narrow pore size distributions with 
mode diameter of around 2.4~2.5 nm. And the peak of pore size distribution for S18 
sample is higher than the other samples. This indicates that S18 sample has the most 
uniform mesoporous structure. On the other hand, the BJH pore size distribution of 
S26 is shifted to the micropore region of less than 2 nm and thus it could not be 
detected in this study. The result is consistent with the nitrogen adsorption/desorption 
isotherms as shown previously in Fig. 5 that S26 has a type I isotherm curve of 
microporous structure. 
ratios between 0.12~0.18. Similar results were obtained by Baccile et al. (2003), who 
reported the optimal molar ratios ranging from 0.15 to 0.25. The difference in the 
optimal molar ratio is mainly caused by operating conditions and the amount of 
precursor solvent.  
The evaporation time of mixture from atomized droplets depends markedly on 
the system flow rate and the initial surfactant concentration. Appropriate evaporation 
time can enhance the formation of micelles with a well self-assembled hexagonal 
structure. The system flow rate in the report of Baccile et al. (2003) was 1.5 times 
higher as compared to this study. It led to the decrease of evaporation\drying time.  
In addition, the amount of ethanol concentration in the report of Baccile et al. 
(2003) is triple as compared to that used in this study. The concentration of alcohols in 
the sol-gel mixture is critically important to the formation of self-organization of 
micelles into periodic meso-structures. It was reported (Li et al., 2006) that the CMC 
of the surfactant increased with the increase of ethanol concentration in the 
ethanol/water/CTAB mixtures, thus resulting in the gradual decrease of the micelle 
size. This is because a small amount of co-solvent (ethanol) in the water/CTAB 
mixtures can promote the surfactant solubility and enhance the micelle formation.  
3.1.4. Acetone adsorption and mass transfer zone 
Fig. 7 displays the equilibrium acetone adsorption capacity of the MSPs 
adsorbents measured by TGA as a function of specific surface area. It is interesting to 
note that the adsorption capacity of MSPs adsorbents can be divided into two distinct 
groups by linear regression. The upper group includes S12, S14, S16, and S18 
samples, which are the well-ordered mesoporous structural MSPs adsorbents. The 
other group includes S06, S10, S22, and S26 samples, which are the less-ordered 
The maximum adsorption capacity is 183 mg/g for S18 sample (Surf/Si molar 
ratio of 0.18). This is in accord to its higher specific surface area. However, a further 
increase of the specific surface area for S22 and S26 samples does not lead to a 
further increase of the acetone adsorption capacity as compared to the S18 sample. 
This might be due to the limitation of less uniformity in the pore structure that 
restrained the internal diffusion of acetone adsorbate in the pores. Thus the pore 
structure of adsorbent is also a key factor for its adsorption capacity. From the above 
results, one can know that the highest adsorption capacity did not occur on S22 
sample with the highest specific surface area. The highest adsorption capacity appears 
for S18 sample which has a lower surface area but more uniform pore structure.  
To further clarify the effect of porous structure, packed column adsorption tests 
for S18 and S22 adsorbents were performed. Fig 8(a) shows the breakthrough curves 
of S18 and S22 adsorbents. As can be seen from the breakthrough curves, the S18 
adsorbent provides a sharper breakthrough curve (thus a thin mass transfer zone) as 
well as higher adsorption capacity than those of S22 adsorbent. This may be due to 
differences in the effective internal diffusion arising from differences in pore 
tortuosity or connectivity. The S22 adsorbent which has a less-organized pore 
structure should have longer diffusion time in the pores thus resulting in a broader 
breakthrough curve (thus a thick mass transfer zone).  
% acetone removal for S18 sample is around 110 mg/g, which is more than twice that 
of S22 sample, 50 mg/g.

3.1.5. Comparison with ZSM-5 zeolite adsorbent 
The ZSM-5 zeolite adsorbent is one of the most popular commercial adsorbents 
for semiconductor and optoelectronic industries on the VOCs adsorption (Chang et al, 
2003). Thus if the MSP can have a better adsorption capacity then it will have high 
potential to replace the zeolite for commercial application. Fig. 9 shows the 
comparison of equilibrium acetone adsorption capacity as well as cumulative 
But their acetone adsorption capacity was about the same as or even less than that of 
the ZSM-5 zeolite.   
In this study, an optimization of the process leading to much higher surface area 
of S18 sample (1153 m2/g) as well as better ordered pore structure which provides 
more adsorption sites and fast adsorption rate. Thus the resulting acetone adsorption 
capacity of S18 adsorbent becomes more than that of ZSM-5 zeolite as observed in 
Figure 9. The equilibrium acetone adsorption capacity of S18 adsorbent is 183 mg/g, 
which is more than twice that of the ZSM-5 zeolite adsorbent, 86 mg/g. While for 90 
% removal of acetone, the cumulative acetone adsorption capacity of MSP is around 
110 mg/g, which is much better than that of ZSM-5 zeolite, 24 mg/g. This provides a 
high advantage for practical adsorption application using S18 adsorbent since it can 
be operated at high acetone removal efficiency with much less quantity of adsorbent. 
3.2 Comparason of MSPs adsorbents and Si-MCM-41 
3.2.1 Characterization of MSPs adsorbents 
Powder low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of calcined MSPs and 
Si-MCM-41 are depicted in Fig. 10. They clearly indicated characteristic low angle 
peaks of mesoporous materials. The XRD pattern of Si-MCM-41 exhibited a well 
ordered structure and the peaks are indexed on a hexagonal lattice corresponding to 
(100), (110), and (200) reflections (Beck et al., 1992). On the other hand, the XRD 
pattern of MSPs revealed only one reflection peak (100) which was the characteristic 
evidence of hexagonal mesoporous structure of spherical particles (Fan et al., 2001; 
Bore et al., 2003). The absence of (110) and (200) reflection peaks for MSPs indicated 
that it has a different pore structure from that of Si-MCM-41 due to the smaller size of 
periodic mesoporous areas. It was also observed that the intensity of (100) reflection 
these two materials were almost the same at p/po = 0 to 0.2 before capillary 
condensation occurs. This region corresponded to monomolecular layer adsorption of 
nitrogen molecules (Langmuir adsorption). The capillary condensation of nitrogen 
molecules within the mesopores was shifted to a lower value of p/po for MSPs than 
the Si-MCM-41.  
The physical properties such as BET specific surface area, specific pore volume 
and the average pore diameter (BJH) of the mesoporous materials are summarized in 
Table 1. The MSPs had a slightly higher specific surface area of 1153 m2/g than that 
of Si-MCM-41, 1115 m2/g. On the other hand, the average pore diameter and specific 
pore volume of Si-MCM-41 was slightly higher than that of mesoporous silica 
particles.

3.2.3 Adsorption capacity and regeneration ability 
To understand the potential application of these two mesoporous adsorbents, 
adsorption tests were also performed on a commercial silica-based adsorbent, the 
H-ZSM-5 zeolite.  The ZSM-5 based zeolite materials are widely used as the 
adsorbents in temperature swing adsorbers (zeolite concentrators) for continuous 
VOCs adsorption and desorption (Chang et al., 2003). The NH4-form of ZSM-5 
zeolite (Si/Al=50) was purchased from Zeolyst Pvt. Ltd. Prior to the adsorption 
experiments, the NH4-form of ZSM-5 zeolite was converted into H-form of ZSM-5 
by calcination at 550oC for 6 hours.   
Fig. 14-a shows results on the comparison of equilibrium acetone adsorption 
capacities of MSPs, Si-MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 zeolite on a mass basis (mg/g). The 
acetone adsorption capacities of MSPs and Si-MCM-41 (both at < 100 mesh size) for 
an acetone inlet concentration of 8700 ppmv at 45 oC were 138 mg/g and 148 mg/g, 
respectively, as tested on the freshly made adsorbents. The MSPs and Si-MCM-41 
had similar adsorption capacities. And they showed much higher adsorption capacities

Figure 14-b. Volume basis comparison on the equilibrium acetone adsorption 
capacities of MSPs, Si-MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5. The adsorbent powders were < 100 
mesh in size. 
 
Fig. 15 shows the adsorption-desorption performance of MSPs, Si-MCM-41 and 
H-ZSM-5 zeolite in terms of adsorption index (%). The adsorption index (%) was 
calculated based on the ratio of adsorption capacity of the regenerated adsorbent to 
the fresh one, thus 100% of adsorption index indicates that the adsorbent is not 
deteriorated at all.  
It can be seen from Fig. 15 that both MSPs and Si-MCM-41 adsorbents showed 
almost no deterioration after regeneration. The adsorption indexes of MSPs after 5 
3.2.4 Pressure drop measurement 
The pressure drop of an adsorbent is another important issue that needs to be 
considered for field application. In this study, the pressure drops were measured by 
columns packed with either powder (50-100 mesh) or pellet (10-20 mesh) types of 
adsorbents. The pellet type adsorbents can be used for air pollution control purpose of 
VOCs presented in indoor or waste gas stream (i.e. end-of-pipe application), while the 
powder type adsorbent can be packed in the column for atmospheric VOCs sampling 
or analysis. Clean compressed air was used as the test stream that passed through the 
column at different values of superficial velocity (i.e. the empty bed velocity). It is 
noted that although the pressure drops for commercial adsorbents are usually 
expressed as ΔP/packed height, but because MSPs and Si-MCM-41 have similar 
adsorption capacity on a mass basis, so in this study the pressure drop is expressed in 
ΔP/g in order to explore the total pressure drop encountered to adsorb similar quantity 
of VOCs adsorbent. 
Values of pressure drop for powder types of MSPs and Si-MCM-41 adsorbents 
as a function of superficial velocity are depicted in Fig. 16-a. It showed significant 
different values of pressure drop between Si-MCM-41 and MSPs adsorbents. The 
pressure drop of Si-MCM-41 was increased drastically with increasing the superficial 
velocity so that the pressure drop measurement could not be continued at superficial 
velocity of over 0.1 m/s. On the other hand, the pressure drop of MSPs powder 
adsorbent not only was lower than that of the Si-MCM-41, but also increased at a 
slower rate as the superficial velocity was increased.

Where Ug is the fluid velocity; ΔP is the pressure drop; L is the length of the 
porous medium; μ and ρ are the fluid viscosity and fluid density, respectively; E1 and 
E2 are Ergun constants; ε is the inter-particle void fraction and dp is the mean particle 
diameter of the granular medium.  The first term on the right side of the Ergun 
equation corresponds to the Blake-Kozeny laminar flow conditions and under such 
not only to the commercialized H-ZSM-5 zeolite but also to the Si-MCM-41. The 
MSPs can be produced by a time-saving synthesized process and it has a better 
adsorption performance. It has been demonstrated that MSP adsorbents synthesized 
via EISA method with optimal Surf/Si molar ratios of 0.12~0.18 have the 
characteristics of high surface area, narrow pore size distribution and well-ordered 
hexagonal mesoporous structure. The surface area is proportional to the Surf/Si molar 
ratio up to 0.22. The highest acetone adsorption capacity appears at S18 sample which 
has less specific surface area but a better pore structure as compared to the S22 
sample. The better uniformity in the pore structure of S18 sample increases the rate of 
pore diffusion of acetone vapors and results in higher adsorption capacity as well as 
thinner mass transfer zone. 
As comparison to the Si-MCM-41 and commercial zeolite, both of its 
mass-based acetone adsorption capacity and regeneration ability are similar to those 
of Si-MCM-41 adsorbent, and they are much higher than those of H-ZSM-5 zeolite. 
The higher bulk density of MSPs adsorbents leads to a higher volume-based 
adsorption capacity than that of the Si-MCM-41. To adsorb the same quantity of 
acetone, the pressure drop of MSPs is also lower than that of Si-MCM-41.  As a 
result, less space and less energy are required when MSPs are utilized as an adsorbent. 
 
V. Project Achievement  
In the project we have successfully synthesized mesoporous (nanoporous) silica 
particles (MSPs) and provided the information of optimal parameter of Surf/Si molar 
ratio to obtain the high surface area and well-ordered mesoporous structural materials. 
And we proved that it has high adsorption potential both in terms of its adsorption

adsorption capacity during cyclic CO2 greenhouse gas 
capture

INTRODUCTION 
The CaO cyclic adsorption is one of the promising CO2 capture technologies owing to its 
advantages of low sorbent purchased cost and high fresh adsorbent capacity.  But CaO is 
also suffered from severe decay in capacity during cyclic adsorption1.  In recent years, 
the modification on CaO to enhance the uptake capacity and reversibility has been a 
subject of study 2.  Feng et al.3 used wet impregnation method to fabricate CaO on high 
surface area support and eliminated the problem of loss-in-capacity. However, the overall 
capacity is not high due to the relatively low content of CaO.  Other researchers also 
tried to improve the reversibility by adding inert complex oxides into CaO reagent4, 5.   
Among these modifications, a Ca-based CO2 sorbent, CaO/Ca12Al14O33, showed an 
outstanding reversibility during thermal swing adsorption.  This compound was 
synthesized from calcium oxide and aluminum nitrate enneahydrate by Li et al.6, 7.  In 
spite of of its high reversibility, the use of inorganic precursor may lead to the formation 
of  NO2 air pollutant during sorbent preparation.  Besides, the optimal CaO content in 
the studies of Li et al.6,7 was only 75%, this indicated that 25% of the adsorbent can not 
be utilized and thus its CO2 adsorption capacity, although less deteriorated, was reduced.  
In this study, it is demonstrated that by using an organic aluminum precursor the optimal 
CaO content can be increased to 95% in the modified sorbent, hence not only the harmful 
air pollution problem could be minimized during preparation but also the CaO adsorption 
capacity could be enhanced during cyclic adsorption of CO2. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Sorbent Preparation 
To synthesize the modified CaO for enhancing its adsorption capacity, aluminum 
isopropoxide [Al(OCH[CH3]2)3](1.13 g) and calcium oxide (10.65 g) were mixed with 
distilled water (250 ml) and methanol (100 ml).  Aluminum isopropoxide was dissolved 
by adding methanol for better mixing.  The mixture was stirred at 75 oC for 1 hour and 
then dried at 110 oC overnight.  After drying, the sample was calcined for 6 hours at 500 
oC and followed by 900 oC for 2 hours in air.  At 500 oC, aluminum isopropoxide would 
first convert to Al2O3 and then react with CaO at 900 oC to form Ca12Al14O33.  Assumed 
that Al2O3 was totally reacted, the weight ratio of CaO to Al12Al14O33 was calculated to 
be 95 to 5 wt % and the adsorbent was denoted as CaAl(95) hereafter.   
 6
Figure 2 shows the CO2 capture efficiency in a packed column test. It is observed that the 
CO2 capture efficiency of CaAl(95) is also higher than that of the unmodified CaO 
adsorbent.  With an empty bed residence time of 0.0074 s, the CO2 capture efficiency is 
~74% for fresh CaAl(95) and 63% after 20 adsorption cycles.  But the CO2 capture 
efficiency for fresh CaO is only 56% and it is 45% after 20 adsorption cycles. The CO2 
capture efficiency of CaAl(95) adsorbent is about 20% more than that of the un-modified 
CaO.  And it is not decreased significantly over 20 cyclic adsorption tests.

SUMMARY 
In this study it has been demonstrated that the Al-modified CaO adsorbent with 5 wt% 
Ca12Al14O33 (CaAl(95)) adsorbent has a better adsorption capacity than the un-modified 
CaO during cyclic adsorption test.  From 5 to 60 cycles the CO2 adsorption capacity of 
CaAl(95) was about 20% higher than that of CaO adsorbent. And at 66th cycle that the 
adsorption time was extended to 1 hr, the CO2 adsorption capacity of CaAl(95) was 25%

Using Waste Organic Solvent Vapors as the Reducing 
Agent of deNOx Process 
 
Extended Abstract # 413

INTRODUCTION   
A large quantity of waste organic solvent generated from chemical manufacturing 
industries has always created environmental problems. For example, significant amounts 
of waste organic solvents from semiconductor and optoelectronic industries which 
contain isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and acetone as major components are facing problems of 
waste disposal due to limited treatment and disposal sites. In this concern, several 
catalytic incineration systems have been developed and widely applied for waste solvent 
treatment1-2.  
 
On the other hand, the nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also major air pollutants in the flue gas 
that need to be controlled. Thus the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx using 
ammonia or hydrocarbons (HCs) such as CH4, C2H4, C3H6 and C3H8 etc. as the reducing 
agents has been extensively studied for the removal of NOx from the exhaust flue gas3-5.              
Because the property of many waste organic solvents is similar to that of the HCs used in 
the HC-SCR process, thus it may be possible to replace the HCs as the reducing agents 
without further purchasing of reagents. This not only saves a significant reagent cost 
during SCR operation, but also minimizes the waste organic solvent treatment and 
disposal problems. There is, however, very little effort devoted to investigate the 
application of organic solvent as the reducing agent in the deNOx process. Recently, Lu 
and Wey6 investigated the simultaneous removals of toluene and NO using transition 
metals impregnated activated carbon (AC)-based catalysts. However, the AC-based 
catalysts are difficult to regenerate because of its poor thermal and chemical sensibility.  
 
This study intends to prepare the copper ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite and study their 
catalytic reduction of NOx using acetone solvent as the reducing agent by a fixed bed 
continuous flow reactor system. The catalytic reactivity of Cu-ZSM-5 is also compared 
with non-porous copper supported metal oxide catalysts such as CuO/SiO2 and 
CuO/Al2O3.  
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Preparation of the Catalysts 
 
Na-form of the ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al=50) was purchased from Zeotyst Pvt. Ltd. They 
were converted into the H-form by repeated ion-exchange with 0.05 M of ammonium 
nitrate solution at 80oC for 12 hours and the obtained material was subsequently calcined 
 10
 
catalytic reactivity of Cu-ZSM-5 could be due to the presence of isolated well dispersed 
Cu2+ ions in the material, which could play a vital role for NOx reduction8. On the other 
hand, CuO/SiO2 catalyst showed a higher NO reduction than CuO/Al2O3 catalyst. This 
could be ascribed by that the CuO species are well dispersed and caused better 
metal-support interaction in the CuO/SiO2 as compared to that of CuO/Al2O3 catalyst. In 
addition, the formation of aggregated CuO species could favor on CuO/Al2O3 catalyst 
because of its very low surface area (SSA: 1 m2/g) and hence it was less active in the 
deNOx reaction.  
 
The conversion of acetone solvent vapors as a function of reaction temperatures are 
illustrated in Figure 2. It is very interesting to note that Cu-ZSM-5 and CuO/Al2O3 
catalysts showed almost similar acetone oxidation activity with respect to reaction 
temperature. But CuO/SiO2 catalyst was less active as compared to those of CuO/Al2O3 
and Cu-ZSM-5. It has been reported that aggregated copper oxide species on the support 
are more active for the oxidation than for the reduction of NO9. From the above 
observation, it is clear that the synergistic interaction between copper and aluminum ions 
in the Cu-ZSM-5 catalyst is a critical factor which may determine the deNOx 
performance of the catalyst.

Ammonia odor adsorption and sensing via a simple 
color change adsorbents made by mesoporous silica

INTRODUCTION 
Ammonia is a colorless, toxic, reactive and corrosive gas of a strong odor. At a 
concentration higher than 50 ppm, it can irritate the eye, throat and nose of human 
beings1. Thus, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets an 
ammonia exposure limit of 50 ppm for workplace air quality2. The US National Institute 
of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also proposes a limit level of 25 ppm for 
ammonia in the workplace3. 
Several technologies have been reported to abate ammonia gases such as thermal 
oxidation, catalytic combustion, selective catalytic oxidation, catalytic ammonia 
decomposition, condensation, membrane separation, scrubbing, adsorption and 
biofiltration4. Among which the adsorption process possesses advantages of high removal 
efficiency, reproducibility and simple operation. 
Amon et al. 5 and Kelleher et al. 6 used the commercial clinoptilolite zeolite coating on the 
building material to remove the ammonia and odor in the livestock industry. Critoph7 
tested the ammonia gas adsorption and desorption of porous activated carbon and proved 
that porous material has good ammonia removal efficiency and can be reused by 
desorption. More recently, ordered mesoporous silica materials are of interest for several 
applications due to uniform porosity, mechanical stiffness, thermal and hydrothermal 
stability, high surface areas and pore volumes, tunable pore size and the possibility of 
incorporation of hetero-atoms into the silica framework8-10. In the literature, MCM-41 is 
successfully applied to the liquid-phase adsorption system. Fiorilli et al. 11 and Onida et 
al.12 coat the Reichardt’s dye on the mesoporous SBA-15 surfaces to develop an ammonia 
gas sensor. Cao and Duan13 designed an optical-ammonia sensor which was composed of 
tungsten halogen light source and miniature fiber optic spectrometer for characterizing 
the absorption properties of the ammonia gas. 
In this study, the ammonia adsorption/sensing material is developed by impregnating 
mesoporous MCM-41 with bromocresol green dye. The ammonia gas 
adsorption/desorption is tested via a continuous flow system to evaluate the change of 
color as well as the adsorption capacities of the sensing/adsorption materials.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
UV-VIS Spectra 
The UV-VIS spectra of the dye impregnated samples are shown in Figure 2. The pure 
solid of BG dye showed two absorption peaks at 400 nm and below 300 nm. Before 
impregnating the BG dye, the host materials of Si-MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 did not 
show any significant peaks in the absorption spectra. But after dye impregnation, the 
color of Si-MCM-41/BG and Al-MCM-41/BG changed from white to orange, and the 
main absorption peaks of dye impregnated materials appeared at 230 and 460 nm. When 
using dye impregnated materials to adsorb the ammonia gas, the color of dye 
impregnated materials changed from orange to blue and resulted in a new absorption 
peak at 630 nm. In addition, there was a red-shift (400 nm → 460 nm) of adsorption peak 
at high wavelength and a blue-shift (300 nm → 230 nm) at low wavelength after 
impregnating BG dye into the structure of host materials.

Adsorption and Sensing Tests 
Figure 3 shows the ammonia adsorption of dye impregnated pellets. One can see that the 
removal efficiencies of both Si-MCM-41/BG and Al-MCM-41/BG could exceed 90%. 
The highest removal efficiency of Si-MCM-41/BG seems to be higher than that of the 
Al-MCM-41/BG. But Al-MCM-41/BG maintained longer adsorption time than 
Si-MCM-41 did, thus it has a higher ammonia adsorption capacity. The color change time 
of samples happened within 5 minutes for both materials with color changed from orange 
to blue.
