In the work, a z-domain model for the CPPLL derived
from impulse invariant transform method is shown. The
z-domain transfer function derived from the linearized
difference equations is identical to the transfer function
calculated using impulse invariant transform. The loop
filter design problem is transformed to a static output
feedback synthesis problem by change of variables and a
recently developed problem conversion technique. Next,
some of the desired performances expressed as
quantitative conditions are derived in terms of LMIs.
Finally, a design procedure is provided for the filter
design via LMI optimization.
PLL frequency synthesizers are widely used to
generate the local oscillator signals in modern wireless
communication systems. The qualities of the PLL, which
include lock time, phase noise and reference spur,
determine the overall performance of the wireless system.
In order to obtain the better spur performance, the
third-order loop filter (LF) is adopted rather than the
second-order loop filter because it provides the added
attenuation from the additional pole.
In contrast to most of the existing methods where the
s-domain model is considered, we treat the loop filter
design in z-domain. Moreover, this work provides an
easy way to search for the filters via efficient convex
optimization tool, which is applicable to third-order and
fourth-order CPPLLs in a unified framework.

二. 研究目的與成果
The goal of this paper is to design a loop filter that
assures closed-loop stability, controls the ripples, sup-
presses the reference spur, and provides sufficient phase
margin for stability and performance requirements. The
results of this work are divided into two parts. The
materials of the following content are from two papers:

Part 1 Fourth-Order CPPLL Design
1. Basics of CPPLL
The CPPLL model used here is shown in Fig. 1,
which consists of a Phase frequency detector (PFD),
charge-pump (CP), loop filter (LF), voltage-controlled
oscillator (VCO), and divider [1].

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of a fourth-order CPPLL
The PFD compares the phase difference between the
positive edges of REF and DIV in order to generate
UP/DN pulses. The CP is then controlled by these pulses
to produce a current cpI that charges or discharges LF
to adjust the control voltage cV . Then the frequency of
the VCO is tuned by cV , being N times to the
frequency of REF when the PLL is in the locked state.
The periodic ripple on the control line of the VCO
(i.e., cV ) generates the unwanted reference spur [3]. The
approximate relation between carrier amplitude carrierA
and spur amplitude spurA is given by [3]

When the values of the parameters a , b , T , 3 and
4 are specified, it is readily checked from that
the resistance 2R and the capacitances 1C , 2C can be
computed via the following formulas:

The selection of capacitance 3C must follow 1 3C C
so that the synthesis framework is valid. The resistance
3R is then determined by
1
3 3 3R C  . With the new
synthesis framework the problem is focused on designing
the parameters a , b and oF .
2.2 Pole Selection for Spur Suppression
The reference spur is caused by the periodic ripple
which has the frequency 1REF T  . The gain attenuation
of the bode plot of LF at frequency REF is concerned in
an effort to reduce spur. It turns out that 1 and 3 are
selected by following formulas:

Considering the extreme case, the charging/discharging
time pt is assumed to be one period of reference clock
when the PLL is in locked state. It is required that the
voltage swing ( )cV T should be less than a bound, say
rV , in order to get a conservative upper bound for the
amplitude of the periodic ripple, that is

Note that S is positive semi-definite. Moreover, for
any loop filter coefficient vector oF , the ripple
swing constraint  is satisfied. Applying Schur
complement and setting 1oF NM

searching for a coefficient vector oF  is equivalent
to finding the matrices 1 2N  , 2 2TM M  

3. Simulation Results
The parameters chosen for the CPPLL are showed in
TABLE I. TABLE II shows the resulting component
values of the loop filters, and the designing parameters for
the different ATTEN1 is displayed by TABLE III. In
TABLE III, the symbol (0)oF denotes the value initially
chosen for oF .
MATLAB’s SIMULINK Version 7.3 is adopted as
the behavioral simulation tool. The charge-pump current
mismatch and UP/DN timing error are considered as
showed in Fig. 5. The extra delay in Fig. 5 is added to
reduce the dead-zone phenomenon [8], but it indirectly
causes the issue that is the spur when the CP current
sources are mismatch. Fig. 6 shows the responses of
VCO’s frequency when ATTEN1=20 and ATTEN1=25.
For ATTEN1=20, the periodic ripple is showed in Fig. 7
when the CPPLL is in the steady state. The period of the
ripple is identical to the reference clock period. Note that
such ripple also exists when ATTEN1=25.
Several performance indices are evaluated for the
resulting CPPLLs as shown in TABLE IV. By , the
filter of the case ATTEN1=25 performs better than that of
the case ATTEN1 =20 on spur suppression by the amount
3.6 dBc. The loop bandwidth of the case ATTEN1=25 is
larger than the other case when the lock time and phase
margin keep unchanged. The large loop bandwidth
benefits the VCO noise suppression because the VCO
noise transfer function is a high-pass. It turns out that the
case ATTEN1=25 is good for the VCO noise and spur
suppressions but is no good for reducing reference clock
noise. In [7], the component values of the loop filter is
determined when a gain crossover frequency (directly
proportioning to loop bandwidth) and desired phase
margin are given. As a result, suppressing the spur is only
by means of reducing the loop bandwidth when the phase
margin keeps unchanged. However, in our approach, the
spur can be suppressed by the pole selection and the
ripple swing control so the decision of the loop bandwidth
is more flexible than [7].
