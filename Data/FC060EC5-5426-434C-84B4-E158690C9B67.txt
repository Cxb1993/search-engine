中文摘要 
酚醛樹脂(Phenolic, PF)由於其具有較優異的機械性質與耐熱性質，其質地堅硬且亦適合生產製造，故
在工業上亦是良好的高分子材料，因此廣泛用於絕緣塗料、接著劑、積層材料、模製材料，它雖具有
良好的性質與應用，但卻因其缺乏韌性與耐衝擊性不佳，故亦使得其用途受到限制。blocked 聚胺基甲
酸酯(blocked PU)為堅韌性極佳之高分子材料，其兼具良好之耐衝擊性質。其質地柔軟，雖具有良好之
耐衝擊性，其卻因而使其機械性質和耐熱性不佳，限制了 blocked 聚胺基甲酸酯(blocked PU)之應用範
圍。因此本計畫旨在利用酚醛樹脂(Phenolic)和 blocked 聚胺基甲酸酯(blocked PU)兩種樹脂之優異特
性，利用同時互穿法(SIN)相互改質製成完全互穿型高分子網狀材料(Full interpenetrating polymer 
network, full-IPN)，改善酚醛樹脂之耐衝擊強度，及增進 blocked 聚胺基甲酸酯之機械性質與耐熱性，
以表現出特異於兩單獨成份的特性。

英文摘要 
Phenolic resin shows the excellent mechanical and thermal properties, which have been widely used in 
insulated paints, adhesives, laminates materials and mold materials. However, phenolic resin could not be 
utilized in some applications for lack of impact strength. Blocked polyurethane shows some unique properties, 
including high impact strength and elasticity. However, blocked PU could not be utilized in some applications 
for lack of mechanical and thermal properties. Hence, the project is going to synthesize phenolic/blocked PU 
full interpenetrating polymer network (full-IPN) using simultaneous interpenetrating network method (SIN). 
The phenolic and blocked PU can modify each other that phenolic can be improved the impact strength, and 
the blocked PU can be improved the mechanical properties and thermal properties. 
Keywords: Phenolic, blocked polyurethane, simultaneous interpenetrating network method (SIN), 
interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). 
 
前言 
Interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) are a special class of polymer blends in which the polymers are 
crosslinked.
[1,2] 
These materials are characterized by the presence of two networks strongly entangled ideally 
only by topological constraints.
[3,4]
 Interpenetrating polymerization is a mode of blending two polymers to 
produce a mixture in which phase separation is not as extensive as it would be otherwise.
[5,6]
 IPN synthesized 
so far exhibit various degrees of phase separation depending mainly on the miscibility of polymers.
[7-9]
 It is 
often important to know the morphology of multicomponent polymer systems, and the factors influencing it, 
since phase domain size and shape, interfacial bonding and phase connectivity determine the physical, 
mechanical and thermal properties of such materials.
[10]
 With highly incompatible polymers, the 
thermodynamic driving force phase separation is so powerful that gross phase separation occurs before 
gelation.  
  The resulting properties are strictly related to both the chemical structure of the networks and the 
synthesis path of the IPN. Two main synthesis routes are used which refer to sequential IPN (SIPN)
[5,11-15] 
and 
simultaneous IPN (SINs).
[16-21] 
SIPN are formed by swelling a polymer network I with a monomer mixture II, 
which is polymerized in-situ. In SIN, both of monomers or prepolymers with curing agents are 
simultaneously polymerized and crosslinked by non-interfering reactions. In this case, if one of the two 
polymers reaches the gelation point before the other, it will tend to be more continuous in space and to 
dominate the material properties. Among the two modes of synthesis, the SIN is generally the best one to 
have a high degree of intermixing compared with the SIPN processes due to the compatibility of the 
monomeric mixture which is much higher than that of a polymeric mixture.
[22]
  
    The phenolic (PF)/blocked polyurethane (BPU) system in this study serves as an excellent model SIN 
system while giving good properties. The morphology of IPN is particularly complicated and has been subject 
to many studies.
[10,23] 
During polymerization, two competing processes take place simultaneously. Phase 
separation of the forming polymer chains proceeds by diffusion through an increasingly viscous medium to 
form phase domains. The formation of crosslinks restricts diffusion, and at gelation, then the present situation 
is frozen in.
[10]
 With highly incompatible polymers, the phase separation is so serious that the gross phase 
separation occurs before gelation. The SIN process can demonstrate very fine micro-heterogeneous 
morphology. The other especially important and fundamental properties of polymer networks are their 
mechanical behavior. The mechanical properties reveal the strength and modulus of various different IPN 
components.  In order to obtain the best mechanical properties of IPN materials, the adding filler in IPN

Preparation of IPN specimens             
Preparation of PF/PTSA prepolymer: 
The phenolic (PF) prepolymer was heated to 50
o
C and then mixed with 3 phr (parts per hundred parts of 
resin) of PTSA and was continuously stirred for 10 min to ensure that the mixing was complete. Finally, the 
PF/PTSA prepolymer was quenched by ice bath for 1 h to prevent further polymerization. The viscosity of 
PF/PTSA prepolymer measured was 200~300 mPa.s at 25
o
C. 
Preparation of BPU/MXDA prepolymer: 
Since the blocked polyurethane (BPU) prepolymer might contain moisture, which can react with NCO 
functional group at high temperature to generate CO2 gas bubbles, the BPU prepolymer was stored under 
vacuum at 50
o
C for 3 h.  The blends of the BPU prepolymer with the chain extender (MXDA) were kept at 
50
o
C and mixed at an equivalent ratio of 1:1 and stirred for 15 min using a high-torque stirrer to ensure that 
the mixing was complete.  The BPU/MXDA prepolymer was stored under vacuum condition due to its 
susceptibility to moisture. 
Preparation of BPU/PF IPN samples: 
The BPU/MXDA prepolymer was blended with PF/PTSA prepolymer at various weight proportions using 
a high torque stirrer at 50
o
C. The mixtures were molded in an ASTM standard stainless steel mold. The shape 
and size of the mold were square-shaped and 300 × 300 × 3.0 mm (length × width × thickness), respectively, 
the surfaces of the stainless steel mold have been treated by chrome plating. The mixture of mold was cured 
in an oven for 4 hour and the temperature was set at 140
o
C. Finally, the samples were removed from the mold 
and kept in a desiccator where the relative humidity was maintained at 50% for at least 2 days before they 
were tested.  
結果與討論 
Synthesis of PF/BPU IPN 
    The reaction mechanism can be described by FTIR analysis. The FTIR spectroscopy analysis is based on 
the peak change of functional groups during the reaction period. Fig.1 shows FTIR spectra of the reaction 
system of the blocked PU (BPU) with chain extender (MXDA) at various reaction times and at a temperature 
of 140
o
C. The spectrum of Fig.1(a) shows no peak at 2270 cm
-1
 corresponding to the isocyanate (NCO) when 
the reaction started, owing to the NCO-terminated PU prepolymer blocked by blocking agent (-caprolactam). 
After heating for 3 min at 140
o
C as shown in Fig.1(b), the absorption peak intensity of NCO at 2270 cm
-1
 
appeared obviously. From the spectrum in Fig.1(c), one can observe that the absorption peak intensity at 2270 
cm
-1
 (NCO) disappeared obviously after reaction for 4 h at 140
o
C. The resulting absorption spectra indicated 
that the majority of the free isocyanate (NCO) groups were generated at elevated temperature, and then, the 
free NCO groups could easily be reacted with chain extender (MXDA). Therefore, the reaction process is 
almost completed in the fourth hour. The deblocking process of BPU was described by eq.(4).
[25]
 Where the 
blocking agent (EH) is -caprolactam. The free NCO groups can easily be reacted with chain extender 
(MXDA). The reaction process was described by eq.(5).

modulus and hardness versus BPU content for unfilled and 10 phr filled (kaolin) of PF/BPU IPN. From these 
figures, all of the properties investigated, decreased with increasing of BPU content. As expected, this can be 
explained that the hard segments of PF appeared to have higher strength and modulus properties, and the soft 
segments of BPU appeared to have lower strength and modulus properties. The existence of BPU soft 
segments may partially be dissolved in the PF matrix (as can be seen from SEM photographs). Therefore, the 
tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, flexural modulus and hardness all decreased with 
increasing of BPU content.  
The elongation and notched Izod impact strength versus BPU content for unfilled and 10 phr filled 
(kaolin) of PF/BPU IPN are shown in Figs.10 and 11. Since BPU may partially be dissolved in the PF matrix 
(as can be seen from SEM photographs) and the interpenetration effect will toughen the matrix of the 
PF/BPU IPN, hence, the elongation and notched Izod impact strength of the PF/BPU IPN increased with 
increasing of BPU content. From the present result it was found that although there is no rubber particle in 
the matrix, the notched Izod impact strength (i.e. high shear rate in fracturing) still could be improved. The 
reason is that the soft segment content of the BPU matrix was toughened by the interpenetration effect and 
showed an increase in notched Izod impact strength. The ductility of the BPU matrix played a very important 
role in toughening at high shear rate fracturing (that is, notched Izod impact strength). The result agrees with 
the toughness mechanism of PU/epoxy graft-IPN which was proposed by K.H. Hsieh and J.L. Han.
[26,27]
 
Effect of filler (kaolin) content: Fig.12 showed the tensile strength and flexural strength versus filler (kaolin) 
content for PF(75wt%)/BPU(25wt%) IPN. It is observed that the tensile strength and flexural strength of IPN 
increased with filler content to a maximum values at 20 phr, and then decreased. The tensile modulus and 
flexural modulus versus filler (kaolin) content for PF(75wt%)/BPU(25wt%) IPN is shown in Fig.13. It is 
found that the tensile modulus and flexural modulus of IPNs increased with filler content to a maximum and 
then decreased. The maximum tensile modulus and flexural modulus occurred at 25 and 20 phr filler content, 
respectively. The resulting maxima of the mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile 
modulus and flexural modulus) for filled IPN systems was due to the addition of the inorganic filler to the 
IPN systems, which made the IPN became more rigid, hence improving the mechanical properties of IPN 
with filler content. However, if an excess of filler existed in IPN resin, the IPN systems became more brittle 
and worse dispersion of filler in the IPN resin, so the mechanical properties of IPN decreased with filler 
content. Fig.14 showed the notched Izod impact strength and shore A hardness versus filler (kaolin) content 
for PF(75wt%)/BPU(25wt%) IPN. It can be seen that the notched Izod impact strength of IPN decreased 
when the filler content increased. The hardness of IPN increased with increasing filler content.   
 
Thermal Properties 
    The thermal resistance of PF/BPU IPN was measured by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 
which included the properties of weight loss and thermal degraded temperatures. The behavior of weight loss 
by TGA over a range of temperature for various PF/BPU IPN compositions was shown in Fig.15. From this 
figure, it can be seen that the weight loss increased with increasing of BPU content. Table I summarized the 
thermal degraded temperatures of Td10, Td20, Td30 and Td40 for various BPU/PF IPN compositions. The thermal 
degraded temperatures of Td10, Td20, Td30 and Td40 were defined as that the weight loss of IPN for 10, 20, 30 
and 40%, respectively. From this table, it can be found that the thermal degraded temperatures of IPN 
decreased with increasing of BPU content. This means that the thermal resistance of PF resin was better than 
that of BPU resin because the structures of BPU and PF are the soft segments and hard segments, respectively. 
Fig.16 showed the weight loss by TGA over a range of temperature for unfilled, 10, 20, and 30 phr filled 
(kaolin) of PF(75wt%)/BPU(25wt%) IPN. Table II summarized the thermal degraded temperatures of Td10, 
Td20, Td30 and Td40 for unfilled, 10, 20 and 30 phr filled (kaolin) of PF(75wt%)/BPU(25wt%) IPN. Also from 
this table, one can observed that the thermal degraded temperatures of IPN increased with increasing of filler 
(kaolin) content. This means that the thermal resistance of PF/BPU IPN with filler is better than that of 
without filler.
