Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional scheme of this work. The high blocking 
capability of this device is achieved by combining: (1) a relatively thin epitaxial 
n/p bi-layer (1.5 μm) based on the charge compensation principle, (2) an 
etched two-zone structure in the drift region, and (3) a semi-insulating 
substrate. The n- and p-type layers with roughly equal doses will deplete each 
other at relatively low biases in the off-state, resulting in high breakdown 
voltage independent of the doping in the drift region. A two-zone design is 
employed to mitigate the surface electric field at drain and gate edges. 
Reactive ion etching (RIE) is used instead of ion implantation to create a 
two-zone structure so as to circumvent the concerns related to high 
temperature anneal and the activation rate, allowing a better control of the 
charge compensation between n- and p-type layers. By using a 
non-conducting substrate to sustain the voltage drop, the electric field in the 
vertical direction is reduced owing to the light doping, yielding a fairly uniform 
equipotential contour that results in high breakdown voltage. The experimental 
results prove the aforementioned approach to achieve high breakdown voltage 
is promising. 
 
Design and fabrication: The base material consists of a Si-face of a 2-inch 8o 
off-axis vanadium-doped semi-insulating 4H-SiC substrate overlaid with a 0.5 
μm-thick n-type upper layer and a 1μm-thick p-type lower layer. The nominal 
doping/thickness of the n- and p-layers were 1.4x1017cm-3/0.5μm and 
6x1016cm-3/1μm, respectively. According to simulation, the breakdown 
voltages are intricately determined by the interplay of the following factors: (1) 
the length of the drift region Ld, (2) the ratio of the zone 1 length Ld1 to zone 2 
4 
 
as a passivation layer and field oxide. Contact windows were then opened, 
and an Al/Ti layer was thermally evaporated and lifted off to create the pads. 
Finally, another 330 nm Al/Ti layer was thermally evaporated and patterned to 
serve as the gate and drain field plates. 
 
Results and discussion: The TLM structures show decent n-type contact 
resistance (Rc) of 6.25x10-5 Ω-cm2 in these devices. Figure 2 shows the 
forward and reverse characteristics of the device with Lg = 5 μm, Ld1 = 37 μm, 
Ld2 = 63 μm, Lgfp = 10 μm and Ldfp = 25 μm, and the width of this device is 200 
μm. Breakdown voltages were measured with the sample immersed in 
FluorinertTM. Before the drain voltage (Vds) reaches 1000 V, the drain current 
(Id) is well below the detection limit of 10-9 amperes (A). Subsequently, Id 
gradually increases toward 10-7 A. When Vds reaches 4400 V, Id rises 
drastically, causing an irreversible breakdown of the device. The threshold 
voltage of the device is about 25 V. The on-resistance (Ron) is 19.2 Ω-cm2, 
dominated by the channel resistance Rch, which is estimated to make up about 
95% of Ron. In the temperature characterization, Ron decreases by as much as 
75% as the temperature is elevated from 300 K to 400 K. Measured separately, 
the channel resistance Rch and the drift region resistance Rdrift respond 
differently as the temperature is increased. The rise of mobility to 3.1 cm2/Vs at 
400 K from 0.5 cm2/Vs at room temperature in a test MOSFET with Lg = 30 μm 
indicates that Rch decreases by 83.3%. Rdrift, measured by using a 
four-point-probe test structure, increases by 85% as the temperature is 
elevated from 300 K to 400 K. When the temperature is 400 K, Rch makes up 
about 63% of the overall Ron. The significant improvement in the channel

Because of the superior material properties, silicon carbide (SiC) devices have
drawn considerable attention in high power and high temperature applications. Promising
performance has been demonstrated on both vertical and lateral devices [1] - [3]. In this
paper, we report the performance of high voltage lateral 4H-SiC JFETs built on a semi-
insulating substrate. The drift region design is based on charge compensation of the n-
and p-type materials. The best achieved breakdown voltage is 3510 V, which is the
highest value ever published for SiC lateral switching devices. Ron,sp is 390 mΩ-cm2,
resulting in a BV2/Ron,sp of 32 MW/cm2.
n- and p-type layers with doping/thickness of 1.4x1017 cm-3/0.5 μm and 6x1016 cm-
3/1 μm respectively were grown on a vanadium doped 4H-SiC semi-insulating wafer.
Aluminum was implanted at 650 oC to form the p+ sinker and the p+ gate. Nitrogen was
implanted at room temperature to form source/drain regions. Both implant species were
activated at 1650 oC for 30 minutes in argon. RIE was performed to create 1.9 μm deep 
isolation trenches. A layer of thermal oxide was grown to passivate the surface. A Ni/Ti
metal stack was thermally evaporated and lifted off as the contacts for n-type
source/drain, the p+ sinker, and the p+ gate. Contact metals were annealed at 1100 oC for
3 minutes in vacuum. A layer of 500 nm-thick PECVD oxide was deposited as the field
oxide. An Al/Ti metal layer was patterned to form the pads and the field plates. Fig. 1
shows the cross-sectional schematic of the devices.
Fig. 2 shows a typical on-state characteristic of a device with Lg = 9 μm, Ld = 100
μm, Lfpg = 10μmand Lfpd = 25μm. The width is 200μm. The device is normally on with
a pinch-off voltage about -11 V. The Ron,sp is extracted to be 390 mΩ-cm2. The
breakdown voltage is 3150V with -16.7V applied on the gate, as shown in Fig. 3. The
leakage current is below 4μAuntil the device experienced a catastrophic breakdown. Fig.
4 shows a typical Id-Vds plot for an Lg = 15 μm and Ld = 100 μm deviceat Vgs = 2 V at
different temperatures. The Ron,sp of these JFETs increases monotonically with
temperature, as shown in the inset. Fig. 5 plots the total resistance of the devices with
different Ld. The drift region resistance accounts for about 60% of the total resistance in
Lg = 9 μmand Ld = 100 μmdevices. Fig. 6 summarizes Ron,sp and BV of the lateral 4H-
SiC devices reported in literatures and demonstrated in this work with Ld = 25, 50, 80,
and 100μm. The BV2/Ron,sp is comparable with other devices while the BV is three times
of the highest value reported previously in lateral SiC JFETs.
