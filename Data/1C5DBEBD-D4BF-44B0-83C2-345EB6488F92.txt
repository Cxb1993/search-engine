N-ITO/TiO2 catalyst could extend the light absorption thredhold to longer wavelengths of 
about 470 nm. The photocatalytic activity on methylene blue (MB) degradation showed a 
degraded rate of 29% under visible-light (420<λ<530 nm) illumination. The 
well-crystillized anatase TiO2 enhanced by the conducting intercalated N-ITO layer 
significantly improved the photocatalytic activity on both MB degradation with rate 
constant of 0.257 h-1 and photocurrent response of 457.7 μA under ultraviolet (UV, λ~365 
nm) illumination. Under UV-365 and visible-light (λ ~466 nm) illumination, the 
N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalyst showed photocatalytic activity for water splitting on hydrogen 
production in 0.6~1.8 N Na2S+K2SO3 aqueous solution. This was made possible because 
the well-crystallized N-ITO/TiO2 heterogeneous electrode was able to prevent 
electron-hole recombination and because the InN phase induced by N-doping of ITO 
intercalated layer improved light harvest in the hybrid N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalyst.

1. Introduction 
 For many years, much research attention has been paid to the use of a titanium 
dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor electrode in the photoelectrolysis of water.1, 2 One of the 
most important aspects of heterogeneous photocatalysis is its improvement in the 
photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The photoactivity of TiO2 depends generally on the 
 2
structure than silicon, glass, quartz and Al2O3. It prevents recombination and produces 
better catalytic activity.8, 9 This improvement comes about because there is a more efficient 
charge transfer between the TiO2 film and the ITO substrate.8, 10 Recently, dip-coating 
TiO2 onto ITO substrate has been shown to make possible more efficient UV-light induced 
and some visible-light-induced degradation of oxalate ions.11 In addition, DC sputtered 
indium nitride (InN) thin film is reported to be an n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 
<1.8 eV, which might make it a potential candidate for the lower part of the hybrid 
photoelectrode.12 
 This paper reports the deposition and photocatalytic activity of this interesting 
nitrogen-doped ITO (N-ITO) semiconductor stacking with the well-known TiO2 thin films. 
2. Experimental details 
2.1 Sample preparation 
 Nitrogen-doped indium tin oxide (N-ITO) was deposited on unheated ITO glass 
substrate, and an overlaid titanium oxide (TiO2) was successively prepared to form an 
N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalyst using a closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering system 
(Teer-450C, Teer Coatings Ltd. UK). The ITO glass substrate, 25×75×0.6 mm, had a sheet 
resistance of 19 Ω/□ and ITO thickness of 100 nm. The N-doped ITO films were deposited 
onto unheated ITO glass substrates using a pair of ITO targets, 90 wt.% In2O3 and 10 wt.% 
SnO2, on one side of the chamber. The base pressure was set to 1.2×10-3 Pa. The sputtering

2.2 Characterization of the samples 
 Phase composition and microstructure of the as-deposited films were analyzed using a 
BEDE D1 X-ray diffractometer. The films were scanned with step size of 2θ=0.09o, an 
incidence of 4o, and a counting time of 2 s using CuKα-radiation at 40 kV, 50 mA. The 
Raman spectra were measured using a JOBIN-YVON T64000 Micro-PL/Raman 
spectroscope and a He-Cd 325 nm laser excitation source. The microstructure of the films 
was observed by scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6700F) at an operating voltage 
of 5 kV. A UV spectrophotometer (Hitachi UV-2900) was used to measure light 
transmittance/absorption of the samples. The microstructure was observed by transmission 
electron microscope (TEM, Philips Tecnai 20, 200 KeV) with point-to-point resolution of 
2.48 Ǻ and a fully digitalized imaging system. The sheet resistance of the oxide films was 
determined using four-point probe measurements (5601Y Sheet Resistivity Meter).

3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Raman and XRD analysis 
 Raman scattering easily revealed all the vibration peaks of anatase TiO2 if anatase 
phase existed in the films. As shown in Fig. 1, all N-ITO/TiO2 catalysts and pure ITO/TiO2 
(I-TiO2) samples exhibited roughly the same five Raman bands at Eg (143, 196 and 639 
cm-1) and B1g (395 and 516 cm-1), corresponding well to the typical Raman fingerprint of 
anatase.14-16 For the sample dN-TiO2, there was a significant increase in the intensity of the 
lowest vibration peak, ~143 cm-1, indicating that crystallinity had been improved, possibly 
a result of the conducting intercalated N-ITO layer in this sandwiched structure. 
 The crystalline structures of the N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalysts were also investigated 
by taking XRD measurements. As presented in Fig. 2, the characteristic XRD patterns of 
N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalysts appeared mostly in the well-crystallized anatase TiO2, 
whereas an additional trace of rutile phase was detected in the sample dN-TiO2. This 
agrees well with the Raman spectra in Fig. 1. The preferential peak anatase (101) was 
recorded at a bulk value of about 2θ=25.30o indicating smaller residual stresses in the films 
due to the increased size of anatase crystallites. The broaden XRD peak at 2θ=30-35o in 
both the sN-TiO2 and dN-TiO2 catalysts might have been due to the N-ITO intercalated 
layer. In general, XRD is usually known rendering average structural information. Thus, an 
N-doped ITO (N-Ito) thin film was prepared in order to reveal the structural information 
 8
addition of an intercalated N-ITO layer, as the effect of the substrate increased as the 
thickness of the overlaid TiO2 thin film decreased. Thus, the sample sN-TiO2 had a better 
configured surface morphology than dN-TiO2, suggesting that the intercalated N-ITO layer 
should be deposited with a buffer layer before deposition of TiO2 thin film when making 
pyramidal grains. 
 Figure 4a shows a representative cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron 
micrograph (HRTEM) lattice image of the N-doped ITO layer on ITO substrate for the 
sample tN-TiO2. As seen in the lower part of the figure, we observed uniform lattice 
fringes of ITO on the ITO substrate. On the other hand, as can be seen in the upper part of 
the figure, an HRTEM lattice image of mixed structure was observed on the N-ITO layer. 
We further analyzed the boxed in areas in Fig. 4a, and found it corresponded to the (101) 
and (112) InN planes with measured d-spacing 2.59 and 1.49 Ǻ, respectively. The 
corresponding diffraction pattern (Fig. 4b) of the sampled area revealed the formation of 
(101) and (112) InN planes, in addition to (222), (400) and (440) ITO planes with 
d-spacing 2.88, 2.52 and 1.77 Ǻ, respectively. 
 As shown in Fig. 5, a representative cross-sectional TEM image, the intercalated 
N-ITO (third) layer consisted of 120×120 nm cubic grains (darkened square), which were 
much smaller than those found in the pure sputtered ITO thin film. The surface 
morphology of thin film is known to be influenced by the nature of the substrate. For 
 10
UV-region (~350 nm) was dramatically increased towards the value of the N-ITO/TiO2 
catalysts. In contrast, the ITO substrate exhibited very low absorption within this 
wavelength. This difference indicated that the doping of nitrogen into the ITO lattice 
forming other phases truly differed from either the ITO or In2O3 component. Meanwhile, 
electrical measurement showed no significant increase in the resistivity when compared 
with the host ITO component. The resistivities of N-Ito, DC sputtered ITO, and ITO 
substrate were 3.6×10-4, 4.3×10-4 and 1.9×10-4 Ωcm, respectively, suggesting that the 
nano-sized InN phase was probably formed in the ITO matrix by N-doping of ITO using 
this technique. This finding was also confirmed by the HRTEM lattice image shown in Fig. 
4. 
3.4 Photocatalytic activity 
 Figure 8 shows the result of MB degradation under UV-365 and BLED illumination. 
We found a linear relationship between ln(C/C0) and UV-365 irradiation time (t), 
suggesting a pseudo-first-order reaction. The duplex, dN-TiO2, catalyst had the lowest 
photocatalytic activity with a rate constant of 0.175 h-1. This reduced activity might have 
been a result of, at least in part, the more flattened surface of the sample. The 
photocatalytic activity on MB degradation has been reported to be significantly increased 
by the surface roughness along with its enlarged surface area.13, 22 The standard, sN-TiO2, 
catalyst showed roughly the same rate constant of 0.257 h-1 as the pure I-TiO2 catalyst 
 12
result of the difference in redox mechanisms underlying photo-splitting and photocatalytic 
degradation in the I-TiO2 catalysts. The detailed mechanisms underlying the formation of 
the visible-light enabling stacked catalysts are under further investigation. 
4. Conclusions 
 In this study, three types of N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalysts were prepared: the standard, 
sN-TiO2, the duplex, dN-TiO2; and the thin, tN-TiO2. Each consisted of about the same 
thickness of overlaid TiO2 films and different thicknesses of the intercalated N-doped ITO 
films under the same well-developed deposition conditions using a closed-field unbalanced 
magnetron sputtering system. The stacked catalysts characterized by XRD patterns and 
Raman spectra showed that nano-sized InN phase was formed by N-doping of ITO 
intercalated layer. The crystallinity and surface morphology of the overlaid anatase TiO2 
films were enhanced by the conducting ITO substrate as a seed for nucleation. The broad 
peak was the (101) InN phase in the intercalated N-ITO layer. In our cross-sectional 
HRTEM image, we could observe the (101) and (112) InN planes with measured d-spacing 
2.59 and 1.49 Ǻ, respectively. The formation of nano-sized InN phase was further 
confirmed by absorption and resistivity measurements. The nano-sized InN phase was 
most likely formed in the ITO matrix by N-doping of ITO. The catalyst with thicker (0.4 
μm) N-ITO intercalated layer exhibited the absorption threshold at wavelengths about 470 
nm, as estimated by the UV-vis transmittance. The N-ITO/TiO2 stacked catalysts showed
