Abstract: Polarization-insensitive wavelength conversion, as well as the 
conversion of return-to-zero (RZ) ON-OFF keying (RZ-OOK) to RZ binary 
phase-shift keying (RZ-BPSK), has been simultaneously achieved at         
40 Gb/s for the first time by cross-phase modulation (XPM) in a highly 
birefringent, nonlinear photonic crystal fiber (PCF). A 10-9-BER receiver 
sensitivity conversion penalty of < 3 dB was achieved for a polarization 
scrambled, 40 Gb/s 25%-RZ-OOK pump, when the 40 Gb/s RZ probe was 
launched at 45o with respect to the birefringence axes of the PCF and when 
the pump-probe detuning was greater than about 6 nm.

(SOP) varies unpredictably in installed fiber plants, was neither analyzed nor experimentally 
investigated. Recent advances in the design and fabrication of nonlinear fiber have resulted in 
short PCF for which the birefringent axes remain fixed over the entire length. The 
commercially available PCF (NL·1550·NEG·1 by Crystal Fibre A/S) used here falls into this 
category, and was confirmed experimentally using the fixed-analyzer technique of Poole [5].  
The transmitted power output by the analyzer varied periodically as seen in Fig. 1, which

confirms that the length of the PCF is shorter than its birefringence coupling length, or that the 
birefringence axes remain fixed over its entire physical length. The PCF can therefore be 
effectively treated as a single waveplate. PCFs can also exhibit a relatively large group-index 
birefringence, in the range of 10-5-10-4 [6]. For this type of PCF, it has been verified [7] to 
exceed 10-5 for wavelengths > 1535 nm using the Jones Matrix Eigenanalysis Method [8]. The

so the first exponential term in Eqs. (1, 2) may be ignored [17, 18], as it rapidly oscillates 
within the length of the PCF, thus averaging out to a negligible value relative to the non-

This equation can be further simplified if the minimum PPD required for polarization-
insensitive XPM is assumed to be a small percentage of typical wavelengths involved: Using

and taking the PCF length to be 30 m, and the pump wavelength at 1553 nm, the PPD resolves 
to 7 nm, which is close to that observed in practice. The difference between the approximate 
Eq. (9) and the exact Eq. (10) is negligible. 
The first terms on the RHS of Eqs. (1)-(2) responsible for the required phase shift show 
that large deviations from π would be expected if the pump (A1) is polarization-scrambled. 
The worst-case scenario occurs when the pump is aligned to one birefringent axis, while the 
probe happens to be aligned with the other. Such cases can be avoided by launching the probe 
at 45o relative to the birefringent axes, or equivalently, anywhere on the great circle of S1=0 on 
the Poincaré sphere. When combined with Eq. (7), Eqs. (1)-(2) finally yield the desired

accumulated noise. The rest of the standard DPSK receiver consisted of OC-768 clock 
recovery, 25-ps-delay AMZI, 40 Gb/s BPD, and a 40 Gb/s TIA. The average power input to 
each detector was about 6 dBm. Baseline receiver sensitivity measurements for RZ-OOK 
were carried out using a single detector in the BPD, with the AMZI bypassed.  
To characterize the sensitivity of XPM induced in the probe as a function of PPD, a 1553 
nm CW laser was used as the probe, and a 0.5-nm OBPF was detuned to the blue side of the 
XPM-induced pedestal in the probe, at the output of the 20-m PCF spool. The resultant signal 
was wavelength-converted 40 Gb/s RZ-OOK. For this experiment, the probe was launched at 
45o with respect to the PCF birefringence axes of the 30-m PCF spool, while the SOP of the 
RZ-OOK pump was swept over the Poincaré sphere through the pump PC. Use of the CW 
probe and blue-shifting the filter relative to the probe carrier at the output minimized cross-
talk complications that would arise with the use of the broadband 2-ps-pulsed probe for PPD 
as small as 1 nm. An optical spectrum analyzer set in minimum-maximum (min-max) power 
mode was used to characterize the power fluctuations in the output probe while the pump SOP 
was varied. Power fluctuation as a function of PPD is seen in Fig. 4, which demonstrates that 
a minimum PPD of ~ 6 nm is required to minimize the power fluctuation in the probe below 1 
dB. Beyond the first minimum, the power fluctuation is seen to be no more than 1 dB larger, 
and gets progressively smaller at larger PPD.

Fig. 4. Power fluctuation observed in the probe spectrum as a function of PPD. 
To carry out receiver sensitivity experiments on the RZ-BPSK signal generated in the 
PCF, the PPD was set to 6 nm (corresponding to pump at 1547 nm). The 40 Gb/s RZ-OOK 
pump was polarization-scrambled, and a 45o-launch was used for the pulsed probe. The results 
are shown in Fig. 5. For the case of ◊, the RZ-BPSK probe demonstrated a < 3 dB penalty 
relative to baseline RZ-OOK (×) which is partly attributed to deviations from π in the XPM-
induced phase shift as the RZ-OOK pump is polarization scrambled (Eq. (11)). For baseline 
RZ-OOK, the mode-locked laser diode was used as the pulsed source. When the pump 
scrambler was turned off while the probe was still in 45o-launch, the receiver sensitivity of 
RZ-BPSK varied by an order of 1 dB as the pump SOP was mechanically swept over the 
Poincaré sphere using the pump PC. While the pump was scrambled, the probe PC was 
adjusted for highest BER (corresponding to launch along a birefringent axis) and maximum 
RZ-BPSK eye-diagram degradation. For this case (∆), receiver sensitivity exhibited an error

independent of PPD, and all the results are also qualitatively reflected in the receiver eye-
diagrams (Fig. 6). This experiment was repeated at other pump wavelengths lower than 1547 
nm, and the resultant receiver sensitivity curves (not shown) were all within a dB better than 
those seen in Fig. 5 due to output OSNR variations in the probe, as neither of the HPAs in Fig. 
3 was gain-flattened. No measurements were carried out for PPD < 3 nm due to a large cross-
talk produced by the SPM-broadened pump, exacerbated by the broad 1-nm OBPF used at the 
output of the PCF, and which was required for the broadband 2-ps pulse used for the probe. 
Typical spectra at various locations in the set-up (Fig. 3) are also seen in Fig. 7. 
It should be stated that although a second, 20-m PCF spool was utilized in the experiment 
to enhance the nonlinearity, the minimum PPD was found to be governed by the 30-m PCF. 
This is due to the fact that the length of the 20-m PCF spool is a factor 2/3- smaller than that 
of the 30-m PCF. Further, the power at the input of the 20-m PCF was significantly smaller 
than that at the input of the 30-m PCF due to the use of a diagnostic tap, and two SMF/PCF 
mode adapters at ~ 1 dB loss/adapter. Consequently, the nonlinear phase-shift due to the 20-m 
PCF spool was substantially smaller than that produced in the 30-m PCF spool.

The modulation format conversion may be applicable to OOK/DPSK mixed-modulation 
format transmission [2], which was found to be deleterious to DPSK due to the XPM-
mediated power-phase conversion of the pattern-dependent OOK channels. By converting the 
OOK channels to pattern-independent BPSK ones, the XPM impairment would be 
significantly mitigated. The technique described herein should be superior to that using bulk 
SOAs, which although relatively polarization-insensitive, suffers from pattern-dependence 
due to a large carrier lifetime, and XGM-induced distortion [4]. Format conversion in PCF on 
the other hand utilizes the ultra-fast χ(3) effect, which eliminates pattern-dependent 
complications.

approach a maximum value, when the ﬁrst binomial
distribution contributes the most to the product in
Eq. (1), but the second and the third terms contribute
little. Moreover, if two pulses are far from each other
in the time domain, the correlation between their
PFs should be zero. Consequently, as N is large, the
main contribution to the DPF is 20,k+1,k+−1,k in
Eq. (2). That is, 2 converges to 21+C12. How-

treated as a perturbation to determine theoretically
the distribution of the IFWM-indcued PF. However,
in previous work,7,8 nonlinearity in DCF was ne-

acteristics of IFWM-induced PF, and especially the
correlation between the PFs of neighboring bits. Ac-

effects in both SSMF and DCF. From the previous

Theoretical bit error rates of the differential phase-shift keying format with various regeneration schemes is

The differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) format
has recently attracted considerable attention in long-
haul high-speed optical communication systems. A
comparison with the traditional on–off keying (OOK)
indicates that the DPSK format offers a sensitivity
improvement of 3 dB and higher nonlinear toler-
ance [1]. Nevertheless, most all-optical regeneration
schemes for the OOK format are not suitable for the
DPSK format, since the phase information of the
DPSK signals will be distorted. Accordingly, several
phase-preserving (PP) amplitude regenerators have
been proposed to suppress the amplitude noise (AN)
of the DPSK signals with negligible extra phase dis-
tortion [2,3]. Additionally, both coherent and incoher-
ent methods can be used to suppress the phase noise
(PN) of the DPSK signals, such as a phase-sensitive
ampliﬁer (PSA) [4] and a phase noise-averaging
(PNA) regenerator [5–8]. While the PSA is proposed
to simultaneously remove PN and AN the require-
ment of a phase-locking pump beam is difﬁcult to
implement. In the approach of PNA regeneration the
PN, t, is converted into the average of neighboring
PNs, t+t−T	 /2, where T is the bit period. How-
ever, the improvement by averaging PN has only
been shown by reducing the variance of PN. Actually,
less than 30% of PN is removed by PNA regeneration
when the PNs of adjacent pulses are uncorrelated [6].
In this Letter, various regeneration schemes are
considered, and the probability density function (pdf)
of the phase distribution and the bit error rate (BER)
of a DPSK system with complex Gaussian noise are
analytically given for the ﬁrst time, to the best of our
knowledge. Comparing the results with an ideal PN
elimination demonstrates that PNA regeneration can
eliminate most of the PN-induced penalty. Since only
Gaussian noise is considered, these results show the
upper limits of various regeneration schemes.
Figure 1 presents the conﬁguration of a linear
DPSK system with a regenerator in front of the re-
ceiver, and n1t and n2t represent complex Gauss-
ian noises that are accumulated in transmission and
loaded before the receiver to enable BER evaluation.
When a polarizer is applied to ﬁlter out the noise,
which is orthogonal to DPSK signals, the signals at
point 1 can be represented as st=At+n1t, where
At= ±A0 indicates phase-modulated signals and the
variance of n1 is 21

suppression capability of a regenerator, all regenera-
tors are assumed to be noiseless and lossless (or
gain=1). With PP regeneration the signals become

BERpna. The error ﬂoors for coherent regeneration
and PNA regeneration are determined by n1, and it
indicates that any regenerator can only improve sig-
nal performance but cannot correct existing errors.
In addition, the BERs indicated by markers in Fig.
3(b) are assessed by the brute-force Monte Carlo
method, performed with 109 bits, and the results
closely agree with each other. The SNR required to
achieve the BER of 10−9, shown in Fig. 4, indicates
that PNA regeneration can remove most penalty in-
duced by PN, because the difference between its SNR
and that of perfect coherent regeneration is less than
0.3 dB. However, if steplike independent amplitude
regenerators are adopted in PNA regeneration
(dashed curve in Fig. 4) then regeneration fails when
1 is less than 16.2 dB. Accordingly, the amplitude re-
generators shown in Fig. 2 dominate the performance
of PNA regeneration if the input SNR is low. Further-
more, Fig. 4 demonstrates that the improvement over
PP regeneration vanishes when SNR is lower than
15 dB, because the PN induced by n1 dominates the
whole PN. Similarly, since averaging PN suppresses
most PN-induced penalties, the signals with PNA re-
sidual AN regeneration can outperform those with
PP regeneration, as 1 is low.
This Letter analytically derives the BERs of
amplitude-regenerated DPSK signals with no addi-
tional phase processing, PN averaging, and ideal
phase regeneration. The SNR difference at the BER
of 10−9 between PNA regeneration and ideal phase
regeneration is less than 0.3 dB, indicating that inco-
herent PNA regeneration eliminates most of the PN-
induced penalty, even though PN is statistically re-
duced by less than 30%.

1. Introduction 
 
Compared with traditional RZ-OOK, RZ differential phase-shift keying (RZ-DPSK) requires 
about 3-dB lower optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) to achieve the same bit-error rate 
(BER), but a more complex transmitter and receiver [1]. The RZ-DPSK and RZ-OOK formats 
can fit different networks [2], and mixed RZ-OOK/RZ-DPSK transmission in wavelength 
division multiplexed (WDM) systems could happen through optical cross-connects (OXC) 
interconnecting different networks. However, RZ-OOK can seriously distort RZ-DPSK by 
cross-phase modulation (XPM) [3], but this impairment may be mitigated by implementing 
RZ-OOK-to-RZ-BPSK format conversion at the OXC level. All-optical RZ-OOK-to-RZ-
BPSK format conversion has been carried out by the XPM effect in nonlinear media, such as 
semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) [2, 4-6] and highly nonlinear fibers (HNLFs) [7]. 
Although the ultra-fast (3)  effect in an HNLF can achieve high speed conversion unlike a 
SOA limited by a slow response time, the (3)  effect is polarization-sensitive and the strength 
of the XPM effect induced by arbitrarily polarized RZ-OOK signals would fluctuate 
unpredictably. Recently, the XPM effect in a linearly birefringent photonic crystal fiber (PCF) 
has been proposed to achieve polarization-insensitive RZ-OOK-to-BPSK conversion [8]. In 
this scheme, the local probe beam is launched equally to both birefringent axes of the fiber to 
reduce polarization sensitivity, obviating the necessity of sophisticated and costly polarization 
tracking of the RZ-OOK signal. To further study the polarization sensitivity, a theoretical 
analysis on the format conversion in a linearly birefringent HNLF is presented here for the 
first time. The penalty induced by insufficient XPM-induced phase shift is also analytically 
investigated. 
2. The XPM effect in a birefringent fiber 
As shown in Fig. 1, while a space in an RZ-OOK signal induces negligible phase shift (close 
to zero), a mark with specific power is supposed to generate a   phase shift to realize all-
optical RZ-OOK-to-BPSK conversion. In the conversion process, the pulse width of the RZ-
OOK signal is normally required to be broader than that of the probe beam to reduce 
unnecessary chirping. Moreover, to avoid erroneous reception of the RZ-BPSK signal in a 
direct-detection DPSK receiver, an electronic decoder would be required in the receiver as 
noted by Mishina et al. [2].

may favorably influence the performance of the received signal, but for the ensuing analysis, 
it is set to zero as it would be for a standard RZ-DPSK signal expected by the receiver (thus, 
the converted probe would be analyzed under the same conditions as the baseline signal.) 
When the phase shift induced by the space of the RZ-OOK pump is zero, the effective XPM-
induced phase shift of Eqs. (6) and (7) can be evaluated as,

Abstract:  This investigation proposes a novel all-optical phase noise 
averager to reduce residual phase noise in the differential phase-shift keying 
(DPSK) transmission system with phase-preserving amplitude regenerators. 
The proposed phase noise averager is based on a phase-sensitive amplifier 
but does not require an extra phase-locking optical pump beam. It can 
increase the correlation between the phase noises of neighboring bits and 
greatly reduce the differential phase noise in the transmission system. 
Independently of the cascaded spans, analytical analysis demonstrates that, 
in the DPSK system with repeated averagers, the total differential phase 
noise will be less than that before the first averager. Theoretical analysis and 
numerical simulation are carried out and confirm the significant 
improvement of DPSK signals using the proposed novel phase noise 
averagers.

constraining PN by the stabilization of amplitude [10, 11], in-line regenerators for DPSK 
signals are needed to manage either AN or PN and to further expand the transmission distance. 
Unfortunately, most of the all-optical regeneration schemes for OOK format [12-14] do not fit 
the DPSK format because the phase information is distorted by these regenerators. 
Theoretically, a phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) can simultaneously reduce both AN and PN, 
and the regeneration was experimentally demonstrated by pumping a PSA with an original 
undistorted DPSK signal [15, 16]. Even so, the coherent pump beam in a PSA is difficult to 
realize in the real world, owing to optical-carrier phase-locking between the pump beam and 
the signal beam. Recently, a nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) with a semiconductor 
optical amplifier (SOA) [17] has been found to yield slight SNR improvements in DPSK 
signals, but not to be effective in extending the reach of DPSK systems. Additionally, several 
phase-preserving amplitude regeneration approaches for DPSK format have been proposed 
[18-21]. The reduction of AN is such that the nonlinear PN caused by the Gordon-Mollenauer 
effect will be reduced [20, 21] and the transmission distance will be extended. Nevertheless, 
these regenerators can constrain only some of the nonlinear PN and preserve the original 
linear PN. They will also cause an additional PN that is transformed from AN. Therefore, the 
accumulated PN distorts DPSK signals and limits the transmission distance. 
This work proposes a novel all-optical phase noise averager (PNA) that is based on a PSA. 
The proposed PNA can average the PN of one bit with that of its neighboring bit coherently 
and does not need an extra phase-locking pump beam. These PNAs can effectively diminish 
differential PN and greatly extend the reach of DPSK signals. The most important and 
appealing feature of the proposed PNA is that, when cascaded, the chain of PNAs results in 
the convergence of PN. In amplitude-managed DPSK systems with repeated PNAs, the total 
differential PN is always less than that before the first averager and is irrelevant to the number 
of DPSK spans.

Fig. 1. Concept of a PNA 
The function of a PNA is to average the PN of one bit with that of its adjacent bit. Figure 1 
presents a simple concept in the realization of a PNA. Based on an assumption that signals all 
have a constant amplitude, E0, each bit of the DPSK signals can be represented as, 
( )0 exp ϕ= ⋅n n nE s E j , where 1= ±ns  corresponds to a zero or π phase shift and φn is 
random PN. After one bit delay, if the logic of the delay data sequence can be modified to be 
equivalent to that of the original DPSK data, as shown in Fig. 1, then the sum of this modified 
signals and the original signals can be written as,

that generated in every K spans. It guarantees that the accumulated PN will not limit the reach 
of a DPSK transmission system with amplitude regenerators and PNAs.

Figure 4 shows the setup of a PNA, which is made up by a PSA. With a pump beam, Ep, and a 
signal beam, Es, the output field of a PSA is [15, 16],

phase slope of this PSA-based PNA, respectively. Therefore, when the splitting ratio of the 
first coupler in Fig. 4 is selected and a fixed phase difference QϕΔ  between the signal arm 
and the pump arm is given, a PSA can function as a PNA.  
4. Simulation of RZ-DPSK transmission 
The convergence of Eq. (5) is derived with an assumption of independent Gaussian PN. 
However, the assumption is not exactly true, especially for high data rate signals, such as 40 
Gbps. This is because, at such data rate, intrachannel nonlinear effects, including intrachannel 
XPM (IXPM) and intrachannel four-wave mixing (IFWM) [26], have a greater impact on 
system performance, and IFWM introduces partially correlated PN on neighboring bits. In 
order to examine the effect of PNAs illustrated in Fig. 4 with actual PN, a single-channel 40 
Gbps RZ-DPSK transmission system is then investigated.  
The transmission system in our simulation is identical to the setup displayed in Fig. 2. The 
laser linewidth of the transmitter is 10 MHz and the duty cycle of RZ-DPSK is 33%. The 
length, dispersion, dispersion slope, nonlinear coefficient and loss of the SSMF are 80 km, 17 
ps/nm/km, 0.07 ps/nm2/km, 1.3/W/km and 0.2 dB/km, respectively. For DCF, the 
corresponding parameters are 13.6 km, -100 ps/nm/km, -0.41 ps/nm2/km, 5.4/W/km and 0.65 
dB/km. The noise figure (NF) of the EDFAs is 5 dB; the launch power into SSMFs and DCFs 
are 3 dBm and -3 dBm, respectively. The approach of the phase-preserving amplitude 
regenerator adopted in the simulation is based on the FWM effect in fibers because it has a 
simple structure. The characteristics of the FWM-based regenerator are described elsewhere 
[20], and in this regenerator, HNLF length, dispersion, dispersion slope, nonlinear coefficient, 
loss, λΔ  (wavelength difference between a pump beam and a DPSK signal beam), pump 
power, output peak power, and filter bandwidth are 1.5 km, 0.09 ps/nm/km, 0.03 ps/nm2/km, 
16.2/W/km, 0.5 dB/km, 3 nm, 30 mW, 8.4 mW, and 160 GHz, respectively. The 
characteristics of the PNA in the simulation are described in Fig. 5. The transmitted signal is a 
De Bruijn sequence of 4096 bits, which provides sufficient pattern length to capture the 
interchannel nonlinear effects [27]. A FWM-based amplitude regenerator and a PSA-based 
PNA are inserted every 400 km of transmission, i.e. K = 5. Figure 6(a) displays the standard 
deviation (STD) of intensity noise (IN) normalized to the average peak power every 80 km of 
transmission. Figure 6(b) shows the STD of differential PN of DPSK signals at the 
corresponding distances. In the DPSK transmission system without regenerators and PNAs, 
normalized IN and differential PN increase absolutely with the transmission distance. With 
amplitude regenerators, IN can be effectively managed, but PN is still continuously 
accumulated. The PN initially declines at first and second regenerators due to the optical filter 
in the regenerators [10, 21]. However, the differential PN with regenerators exceeds that 
without regenerators after 1600 km, because the regenerators add extra PN [20]. If PNAs are 
inserted after regenerators, then the differential PN behind the averagers is constrained below 
that just in front of the first averager. Moreover, accumulation of differential PN in Fig. 6(b) is 
slightly faster than the analytical results depicted in Fig. 3, since the partially correlated PN of 
neighboring bits are considered in the simulation. Figures 7(a)-7(d) illustrate the differential 
phase constellations and differential phase eye-diagrams [24] of DPSK signals after 2800 km 
of transmission with and without PNAs. In Figs. 7(a) and 7(c), the DPSK signals without 
PNAs suffer from serious PN and the differential phase eye is almost closed. Consequently, 
although the amplitude of DPSK signals is managed well, as shown in Fig. 7(a), the groups 
with zero and π phase shifts almost overlap each other. When PNAs are used, PN is managed 
efficiently even after 2800 km of transmission and the performance of signals is effectively 
maintained.  
Furthermore, in WDM systems, nonlinear PN induced by interchannel XPM effect has 
been shown to be strongly correlated between neighboring bits [5], as well as that induced by 
IFWM. When this kind of nonlinear PN dominate the whole PN, Eq. (4) should be modified 
(C) 2006 OSA 16 October 2006 / Vol. 14,  No. 21 / OPTICS EXPRESS  9590
and rewriting PN in Eq. (1) as ( )1 10 1 1 2n n nC Cϕ ϕ ϕ −′ = ⋅ + ⋅ , the PN passing through PNA 
twice becomes,
