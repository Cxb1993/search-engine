inputs and outputs in the new allocations could be increased or decreased without the 
consideration of the conditions of each local branch bank. For each branch bank, the 
decision makers of the bank may set a limitation for each index in the change 
between new and current allocation. To have the limitation the decision makers 
needs to examine the applicable capability of the branch bank on the index. We add 
all the possible limitations to the model in Phase-One to have the second model. The 
district manager would have a new applicable plan for allocating the level of each 
input and output for each branch bank. In addition, the most favorable set of weights 
for the inputs and outputs indices for having the district manager’s performance is 
obtained. 
 We study the real case of a commercial bank in Taiwan. We take a 
commercial bank in Taiwan as a case study in this study, which owns 25 local 
branches in a specific district. We collected the data of five inputs and four outputs

Appendix 
Reallocating multiple inputs and outputs of units to improve the overall 
performance 
1. Introduction 
The aim of this research is to develop a procedure to improve an 
organization’s overall performance. There are several units (units of assessment, 
UOAs) under the governance of the decision maker of the organization. The units 
are assessed by multiple input and output indices. The decision makers of the 
organization attempt to adjust the input and output of UOAs to improve the overall 
performance and to achieve maximum profits. Such a study is named as resource 
allocation problem or production assessment/production management. For instance, 
a commercial bank reallocates each branch bank’s input and output to improve the 
 4
conditions of each local branch bank, we add all the possible limitations to the model 
in Phase-One to have the second model. The district manager would have a new 
applicable plan for allocating the level of each input and output for each branch. In 
addition, the most favorable set of weights for the inputs and outputs indices for 
having the district manager’s performance is obtained. 
This research is arranged as follow: we review the literatures in the 
penultimate section. We propose a new slack-based centralized resources 
reallocation model in Chapter three, discussing the way of reallocating the input 
resources to achieve best performance. In Chapter four, we discuss the restriction of 
resources reallocation, and the decision makers may set restrictions to each index in 
UOAs to meet practical needs. In Chapter five, a commercial bank will be analyzed 
based on the models above as a case study. Lastly, other resources allocation models 
and follow-up studies will be introduced in Chapter six. 
2. Literature review 
The conventional DEA study focuses on the evaluation of the performance of 
each decision making unit (DMU), which owns absolute autonomy to adjust the 
amount of the input and output. Thus, the evaluation of DEA will obtain the most 
favorable set of weights for the inputs and outputs indices of each individual DMU. 
Since the set of weights of each DMU may be different, this research focuses 
on the overall performance of the whole organization instead of analyzing each 
DMU’s performance. In this study, each unit is named as UOA (units of assessment) 
instead of DMU. The managers, the decision makers of the organization, own the 
power to allocate the volume of the input indices to have the expected volume of the 
output indices for all units under his/her commands. The two-phase mathamatic 
programming model in this research aims to obtain a set of weights to maximize the 
overall performance and get the new allocation in each UOA. 
The first phase in this research is the radial-based centralized resource 
allocation model, which discusses the overall performance of the organization. This 
phase includes two stages: the former one pursues the optimal overall performance, 
then the slack of each index will be further obtained in the latter stage. The efficient 
score is over-estimated since the slack is not accounted in the efficient score. The 
model proposed by Lozano and Villa (2004) can be taken as a special case with the 
common weights restrictions under the radial-based. In addition, with this model, we 
may consider the allocation of UOA with minimum consumption from an 
input-oriented model, or, with maximum total output production from an 
output-oriented approach. Thus, we repropose a radial-based centralized resource 
allocation model based on slacks-based measure (SBM; Tone, 2001). In this way, 
the defect of slack missing can be solved; meanwhile, the input and output indices 
 6
reallocation with parallel output standard. If multi-answers are produced, another 
approach will be brought up to solve this situation. 
Practically, resources (input/output indices) may not be reallocated easily 
because of the influences of congenital or acquired factors. For instance, during the 
process of branches evaluation, the square measure of floors of each branch is one of 
inputs that affect the preference. In fact, this resource is not altered easily. It is hard 
to find another suitable place for fitting the square measure of floors, and the change 
of position will influence the other outcomes directly. Such an index is a 
non-controllable factor, and this can be reflected in our models. 
In addition, it may be practically difficult to carry out the new reallocation 
produced from the calculation in Phase-One. For instance, new allocation expects an 
UOA to increase its achievement (output index) 200% and decrease its labor power 
(input index) 30%. It may be not applicable. Thus, we establish Phase Tow to get a 
new allocation. Phase-Two utilizes a linear programming model to set a restriction 
for each index in the change between new and current allocation to get a new 
allocation, which is helpful for practical application. 
3. Phase-One 
In our research, we propose the new model, slacks-based centralized resource 
allocation model, [C-SBM]. It is based on the ideas of radial-based centralized 
resource allocation model (Lozano & Villa, 2004) and slacks-based measure (SBM, 
Tone, 2001). We will describe the dual model of [C-SBM], and interpret it properties 
by the estimation of efficiency score. 
3.1 [ C-SBM] model 
Lozano & Villa (2004) propose the radial-base centralized resource allocation 
model based on conventional BCC model (Cooper et al., 2000). Considering 
minimizing the total input consumption (or maximizing the total output production), 
the inputs/outputs targets of each UOA will be found. In order to deal with the slacks; 
the radial-based input-oriented centralized resource allocation model is framed by 
two phases. Here, we denote their radial centralized resource allocation models as 
[C-BCC]. However, the efficiency of radial-based model is not able to take account 
of slacks of inputs and outputs. For instance, the efficiency score which is estimated 
by radial-based model might be with positive slacks. The radial-based model does 
not hold the property of units-invariant. 
Tone (2001) proposes slacks-based measure (SBM) model. In contrast to 
radial-based model, the SBM deals directly with input excess and output shortfall. 
The model is satisfying properties: unit invariance and monotone with respect to

In (1.1), ∑ =nk ikx1  and ∑ =nk rky1  are the sum of ith input and rth output 
respectively.  and  are the sum of ith input reductions and rth 
output increases respectively. For entire organization, the proportions of ith input 
reductions and rth output increases are

( ) ( )∑ ∑∑∈ ==xci nk iknk ik xqm 11'1  and ( ) ( )∑ ∑∑∈ =ycr nk rknk rk yps 11'1 =  are the average 
proportions of each controllable input reductions and each controllable output 
increases separately. Hence, the numerator and denominator in (1.1) are the 
reductions percentage of total inputs and the increases percentage of total outputs 
respectively. The proportion of numerator and denominator is the aggregate efficient 
score. In other words, the score of most efficiency is 1 (100%). If the average 
improvement proportion of inputs and outputs in organization is 0, the usage of its 
inputs and outputs is perfect. Therefore, (1.1) is interpreted to the aggregate 
preference of the organization, and the efficient score is not excess 1. 
In conventional SBM model, it is used to find the projection of each DMU to 
improve the efficiency individually, and the average improvement proportion of 
inputs and outputs is seem as the efficient score of the evaluated DMU. In our 
proposed [C-SBM] model, we can consider n UOAs at the same time in an aggregated

The dual variables vik and urk can be interpreted as the virtual cost and virtual 
price of the ith input and the rth output, respectively. In other words, vik and urk can 
also be seems as the weights of ith input and rth output for evaluating the efficiency 
of UOAk. ξk is the scalar associated with (3.7), VRS (variable returns-to-scale) 
auxiliary variable for UOAk (Lozano, Villa, 2004). ai and br are the dual variable of 
(3.9) and (3.10) respectively. In (M4), because ai and br are positive variables in the 
constraints (4.6) and (4.7), we can eliminate ai and br in (M4) as (M5).

Comparing (M1) and (M8), (M8) is a special case of (M1), as the associated 
dual variables in (M1) with the common weights. (M8) enables the manager of the 
organization to  (re)allocating the resource of organization with the restriction of 
common weights and maximizing the aggregate efficiency, the manager would 
obtain the improvement on each input/output index for all the UOAs, qi, pr, 
respectively. Note, qi and pr must be positive. Comparing with the radial-based 
centralized resource allocation model (Lozano and Villa, 2004; denoted L&V), we 
can claim that L&V model is the special case with the common weights restrictions 
under the radial-based. Note, it’s only need computing one in our slacks-based 
model (the radial-based model should be computing by two phases). 
3.2 Multiple solutions 
To linearization (M8) for solving (M8), the process is similar as (M1). We 
multiply a scalar variable t (>0) to the numerator and denominator separately and let 
the term of denominator equal 1. Then, the products of variables transfer in single

Here, ς* is the optimal solution in (M9). Now, we compare the radial-based 
resource allocation model, L&V model, and our slacks-based model (M9) and (M10) 
by using several numerical examples. Table 1 is showed the data of example, 
Lozano and Villa (2004) and Golany et al. (1993) used. It is a two-input, two-output 
problem. The results are showed as follow. In this example, x1, x2∈cx and y1, y2∈cy.

The linear formulation of (M11) is similar to (M1). We can obtain the optimal 
solution ( )**** ,~,~,~ jkrjij pq λρ  from (M11). The αik and βrk are the results from 
Phase-One, by which decision makers are able to make adjustments. For instance, a 
central decision maker evaluates one subordinate UOA and gets its output index 
rjrk yp
*  as 200% in Phase-One. For this UOA, it is defecult that the highest 
percentage they may achieve may be 150%. Thus decision makers may set the 
parameter rkβ  = 150% in (M11). Similarly, we may set restrictions to each index in 
the UOA to achieve the most practical goal. This model considers the restrictions to 
the practical situations.

Table 4 refers to the improved percentage of the inputs/outputs of the UOAs. In 
regard to the input indices, the positive percentage means that the input decreases in 
the UOA; on the contrary, the negative percentage denotes the increased input. In 
regard to the output indices, the positive percentage refers to increased output, and 
the negative one means decreased output. Practically, managers may adjust the input 
resources arbitrarily, thus there is no limitation to resource adjustment in UOA. 
Viewed from Table 4, the percentages of UOA8, UOA9, UOA13, UOA15, and UOA17 
on y1 are so high, particularly UOA9, UOA13, and UOA15.  For these three branches, 
it may be difficult to increase the operating target with two-fold. Therefore, decision 
makers may set an applicable parameter to (11.13) in model (M11) with the method 
used in Phase-Two.

6. Conclusion and discussion 
In this paper, we propose the [C-SBM] model to solve the resource 
(re)allocation problems. In the dual model of [Computing C-SBM], there are k sets 
of weights, vik and urk, for individual UOAk in (M5). In practical, we need the 
standard measure to (re)allocate the performance indexes. However, the centralized 
decision makers have power to determine the standard measure, the weights of 
inputs/outputs. Hence, we revise (M5) under the restrictions of common weights, vi 
= vik for ∀k and ur = urk for ∀k. So (M7) is the special case of (M5) that there is a 
common set of weights of all UOAs. 
Comparatively, the [C-SBM] model reflects and takes the influences of 
input/output indices on operating performance into account at the same time. If 
decision makers consider resources reallocation by single input or output-oriented, 
the models, [C-SBM (I)] and [C-SBM (O)], help to consider the resources allocation 
with minimum input/ maximum output as follow:

the common weights restrictions under the radial-based. We eager to not only 
achieve optimal performance theoretically, but also look for applicable solutions to 
practical problems. This model can be applied widely to the organizations with 
subordinate branches, such as banks, governments, education institutions, chain 
markets/convenent stores etc. 
Comparing the general model (M1) and the common set of weights model 
(M8), their essences are totally different. (M1) is used preferred weights of each 
UOA, but (M8) is evaluated the common set of weights. In practical applications, 
sometimes the UOAs are classified by their properties. For example, bank branches 
can be categorized by different regions. In the different region, the levels of 
economy are not equal. It could be affect the evaluation of resource (re)allocations. 
So we can use the different sets of weights by the different categories of UOAs, and 
using the common set of weights in the same categories. In the future research, we 
can consider the classified UOAs in (re)allocation problems by merging the idea of 
(M1) and (M8).

Abstract
The managers of private and public sectors often assess operation units under their
governance (UUG) with their consumed resources and produced outputs. In this research, we
develop a procedure to re-allocate the resources among the UUGs of the management sector
to improve its aggregated productivity. In our model, apply the linear programming model we
developed to obtain a common set of weights for the productivity indices so that the
aggregated productivity of the sector is maximized. The new resources allocation and the
expected level of outputs for the UUGs are designated as well. The allocation of
resources/outputs and the productivity of every UGG are also obtained.
Key words: resource allocations, performance, common set of weights
1 Introduction
The managers of private and public sectors often assess operation units under their
governance (UUG) with their consumed resources and produced outputs. The aim of this
research is to develop a procedure to improve an organization’s overal performance. There 
are several UUGs under the governance of the decision maker of the organization. The units
are assessed by multiple input and output indices. The decision makers (DM) of the
organization attempt to adjust the input and output of UUGs to improve the overall
performance and to achieve maximum profits. Such a study is named as resource allocation
problem or production assessment/production management. For instance, a commercial bank
realocates each branch bank’s input and output to improve the overal performance. It is 
commonly required for government or private organizations to have such a procedure.
The conventional DEA studies focus on the evaluation of the performance of each
decision-making unit (DMU), which owns absolute autonomy to adjust the amount of the
input and output. Thus, the evaluation of DEA will obtain the most favorable set of weights
for the inputs and outputs indices of each individual DMU.
Since the set of weights of each DMU may be different, this research focuses on the
overal performance of the whole organization instead of analyzing each DMU’s performance. 
In this study, the term DMU is replaced by UUG to reflect the unit is under governance of the
DM. But in the mathematical expressions, DMU and UUG are interchangable. The manager,
the DM of the organization, own the power to allocate the volume of the input indices to have
the expected volume of the output indices for all units under his/her commands.
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA; Charnes et al., 1978; Banker et al., 1984; Cooper et al.,
2007) is commonly employed for performance evaluation. The model in Lozano and Villa

It provides applicable targets for resources reallocation with parallel output standard. If
multi-answers are produced, another approach will be brought up to solve this situation.
2 Slacks-Based Centralized Resource Allocation Model
In our research, we propose the new model, slacks-based centralized resource allocation
model, [C-SBM]. It is based on the idea of radial-based centralized resource allocation model
(Lozano & Villa, 2004) and slacks-based measure (SBM, Tone, 2001). We will describe the
dual model of [C-SBM], and interpret it properties by the estimation of efficiency score.
[C-SBM] model
Lozano & Villa (2004) propose the radial-base centralized resource allocation model based
on conventional BCC model (Cooper et al., 2007). Considering minimizing the total input
consumption (or maximizing the total output production), the inputs/outputs targets of each
UUG will be found. In order to deal with the slacks; the radial-based input-oriented
centralized resource allocation model is framed by two phases. Here, we denote their radial
centralized resource allocation models as [C-BCC]. However, the efficiency of radial-based
model is not able to take account of slacks of inputs and outputs. For instance, the efficiency
score which is estimated by radial-based model might be with positive slacks. The
radial-based model does not hold the property of units-invariant.
Tone (2001) proposes slacks-based measure (SBM) model. In contrast to radial-based
model, the SBM deals directly with input excess and output shortfall. The model is satisfying
properties: unit invariance and monotone with respect to slacks. In radial-based model, the
efficiency score are evaluated within the slacks. Conversely, calculating the efficiency score
by SBM is exclusive the effect of slacks. The notations used in our proposed [C-SBM] model
are listed below.
Indexes
j, k: indexes for UUGs; i: index for inputs; r: index for outputs
Parameters
n: number of UUGs; m: number of inputs; s: number of outputs
xij amount of input i consumed by UUGj
yrj quantity of output r produced by UUGj
Decision variables
ρ the aggregate efficient score of the organization
qik the slack of input i for projecting UUGk, i =1~m
prk the slack of output r for projecting UUGk, r = 1~s
qi total slack of the input i, qi =nk=1 qik, i = 1~m
pr total slack of the output r, pr =nk=1 prk, r = 1~s
λjk the linear combination weights of UUGj (j = 1~n) when UUGk (k = 1~n) change its
inputs and outputs
(M1) [C-SBM]
ρ* = Minimize [1 –(1/m) mi=1 (nk=1 qik / nk=1 xik)] / [1 + (1/s) sr=1 (nk=1 prk / nk=1 yrk)]
(1.1)
s.t.nj=1 xijλjk = xik–qik, i =1~m, k = 1~n, (1.2)
nj=1 yrjλjk = yrk + prk, r =1~s, k = 1~n, (1.3)
nj=1λjk = 1, k = 1~n,nk=1 qik0, i =1~m,nk=1 prk0, r = 1~s, (1.4~1.6)
λjk0, j = 1~n, k = 1~n, qik, prk free in sign, i =1~m, r =1~s, k = 1~n. (1.7~1.8)
表 Y04 6
s.t. t + (1/s)sr=1 (nk=1 Prk /nk=1 yrk) = 1, (3.2)
nj=1 xijΛjk = txik–Qik, i =1~m, k = 1~n, (3.3)
nj=1 yrjΛjk = tyrk + Prk, r =1~s, k = 1~n, (3.4)
nj=1Λjk = t, k = 1~n,nk=1 Qik0, i =1~m,nk=1 Prk0, r = 1~s, (3.5~3.7)
Λjk0, j = 1~n, k = 1~n, t > 0, Qik, Prk free in sign, i =1~m, r =1~s, k = 1~n.(3.8~3.10)
The optimal solutions of (M3), (τ*, t*, Λ*jk, Q*ik, P*rk), could be converted to the optimal
solution of (M2) by following equations.
ρ* =τ*,λ*jk =Λ*jk / t*, q*ik = Q*ik / t*, p*rk = P*rk / t*.
According to equations (1.2) and (1.3), respect to UUGk, the modified targets of UUGj in
all indices are expressed by the following equations.
ikx
~ =nj=1λ*jk xij = xik–q*ik, i = 1~m, k = 1~n,
rky
~ =nj=1λ*jk yrj = yrk + p*rk, r = 1~s, k = 1~n.
xij and yrj are modified by the amounts q*ik and p*rk, respectively. Note, q*ik and p*rk could
be positive or negative. The total modifications of UUGj respect to all UUGs are computed
by the equations: q*i =nk=1 q*ik, i = 1~m; p*r =nk=1 p*rk, r = 1~s.
The dual model (Hillers & Lieberman, 2005) of (M3) is showed as (M4):
(M4)
Maximizeς (4.1)
s.t.ς+mi=1nk=1 vik xik–sr=1nk=1 urk yrk–nk=1k = 1, (4.2)
–mi=1 vik xik +sr=1 urk yrk +k0, j = 1~n, k = 1~n, (4.3)
vik(1/m)(1 /nk=1 xik) + ai, i = 1~m, k = 1~n, (4.4)
urk(ς/s)(1 /nk=1 yrk) + br, r = 1~s, k = 1~n, (4.5)
ai0, i = 1~m, br0, r = 1~s. (4.6~4.7)
The dual variables vik and urk can be interpreted as the multiplier (i.e., cost/price) assigned
to the ith input and the rth output, respectively. In other words, vik and urk can also be seems
as the weights of ith input and rth output for evaluating the efficiency of UUGk. ξk is the
scalar associated with (3.5), the VRS auxiliary variable for UUGk. ai and br are the dual
variable of (3.6) and (3.7) respectively.
Here, (4.3) can rewritten as (sr=1 urk yrj +k) /mi=1 vik xij1, j, k = 1~n. The numerator
is the sum of virtual price and scalar of VRS. The denominator is the sum of virtual cost. The
ratio is the efficiency score of UUGj respect to UUGk. The efficiency score for all UUGs does
not excess one. The sets of constraints for vik and urk, (4.4) and (4.5), restrict the feasible vik
and urk to semi-positive. The conventional radial-based DEA models, CCR (Charnes et al.,
1978) and BCC (Banker et al., 1984), restrict the indices’weights by vik> 0 and urk>
0 as evaluating the object DMUk (decision making unit), where εis a non-Archimedean
infinitesimal positive constant.
With (4.1) and (4.2), the value of the aggregate profit, sr=1 nk=1 urk yrk –mi=1 nk=1 vik
xik, plus the sum of the scalars,nk=1k, are maximized. The value ofnk=1k could be greater,
equal, or smaller than zero that respectively indicate the total return-to-scale are increasing,
constant, or decreasing.
We compare [C-SBM] with the conventional slacks-based DEA models [SBM-V] (Tone,
2001; Cooper et al., 2007). [SBM-V] model is used to analysis the relative performance of
each DMU, and to set improved targets of each DMU separately. However, there are
situations in which all the UUGs are under the same organization, and the DM has an interest
in maximizing the efficiency of individual DMU at same time. [C-SBM] model is concerned
表 Y04 8
Considering the radial-based centralized resource allocation model (Lozano and Villa,
2004; denoted L&V), we can claim that L&V model is the special case with the common
weights restrictions under the radial-based. Note, it’s only need computing one in our 
slacks-based model (the radial-based model should be computing by two phases).
Multiple solutions of [C-SBM-CW]
To linearization [C-SBM-CW] for solving, the process is similar as [C-SBM]. We multiply a
scalar variable t (> 0) to the numerator and denominator separately and let the term of
denominator equal 1. Then, the products of variables transfer in single variable. The results of
transformation are showed as (M7). Note, (M5) and (M7) are duality models.
(M7)
τcw* = Minimize t–(1/m)mi=1 (Qi /nk=1 xik) (7.1)
s.t. t + (1/s)sr=1 (Pr /nk=1 yrk) = 1, (7.2)
nk=1nj=1 xijΛjk = tnk=1 xik–Qi, i =1~m, (7.3)
nk=1nj=1 yrjΛjk = tnk=1 yrk + Pr, r =1~s, (7.4)
nj=1Λjk = t, k = 1~n, (7.5)
Qi0, i =1~m, Pr0, r = 1~s,Λjk0, j = 1~n, k = 1~n, t > 0. (7.6~7.9)
In this case, it obtains the multiple optimal solutions by (M7). To deal with this situation,
we propose one approach to choose the most appropriate solution from the multiple optimal
solutions. To apply this approach, we consider the dual form of (M7), e.g., (M5). Consider
one set of output indices with two sets of different indices values which the same weighted
sums, it is preferable for output indices to adopt the smaller range of weights (Obata et al.,
2003). They explain that the benefit of the weighted sum is from the indices value itself,
rather than from the individual weights. In following model (M8), the most appropriate set of
the multiple optimal solutions in (M7) will be calculated by using L1-norm.
(M8)
τcw* = Minimizesr=1 Ur–mi=1 vi (8.1)
s.t.ςcw* +mi=1 Vink=1 xik–sr=1 Urnk=1 yrk–nk=1cwk = 1, (8.2)
–mi=1 Vi xik +sr=1 Ur yrk +cwk0, j = 1~n, k = 1~n, (8.3)
Vi(1/m)(1 /nk=1 xik) + ai, i = 1~m, (8.4)
Ur(ςcw*/s)(1 /nk=1 yrk) + br, r = 1~s. (8.5)
Here,ςcw* is the optimal solution in (M7). Now, we compare the radial-based
resource allocation model, L&V model, and our slacks-based model (M7) and (M8) by
using several numerical examples.
Table 1 is showed the data of example, Lozano and Villa (2004) and Golany et al. (1993)
used. It is a two-input, two-output problem. The results are showed in Table 1. In the last row
shows our proposed procedure would have less variance for the indices. In other words, our
new allocation is more centralized.
As shown in Table 2, we compare the results of L&V and our proposed models. The
aggregate performance score of L&V 0.824 is under estimated since the radial model does
not include the slack on each input and output. The slacks in the four performance indices of
L&V model are 0(0% ofnk=1 x1k), 0(0% ofnk=1 x2k), 7.824 (21.145% ofnk=1 y1k), and
2.176 (6.595% ofnk=1 y2k), respectively. Our model obtained lower but more accurate
aggregate performance score. The two models obtained different common set of weights.
表 Y04 10
[C-SBM-O], help to consider the resources allocation with minimum input/maximum output
as follow:
(M9) [C-SBM -I]
ρ*I = Minimize 1–(1/m)mi=1 (nk=1 qik /nk=1 xik) (9.1)
s.t. (1.2) ~ (1.8).
(M10) [C-SBM-O]
ρ*O = Maximize 1 + (1/s)sr=1 (nk=1 prk /nk=1 yrk) (10.1)
s.t. (1.2) ~ (1.8).
In addition, practically, it is allowable for DM to have preferences on inputs/outputs. We
propose [C-SBM-Preference] model to reallocate resources and get a new reallocation targets
of input and output indices. It assumes that wi andπr are the preference parameter of the total
input i and total output r. We addπr andπr into (1.1).
(M11) [C-SBM-Preference]
ρ* = Minimize [1–(1/m)mi=1 wi (nk=1 qik / nk=1 xik)] / [1 + (1/s)sr=1r (nk=1 prk /nk=1
yrk)] (11.1)
s.t. (1.2)~(1.8).
The calculation models of (M9), (M10) and (M11) are left out since they are similar to the
[C-SBM]. In addition, in (M5), we may consider to addLjvi xij /i vi xijUi,i, j and
Lrur yrj /r ur yrjUr,i, j into the model. Managers may set limitations to different
virtual input and output indices (Wong and Basely, 1990).
This research suggests a series of resources reallocation models for the central DM to
adjust the resources and achieve optimal overall performance. The model proposed by
Lozano and Villa (2004) can be taken as a special case with the common weights restrictions
under the radial-based. We eager to not only achieve optimal performance theoretically, but
also look for applicable solutions to practical problems. This model can be applied widely to
the organizations with subordinate branches, such as banks, governments, education
institutions, chain markets/convenent stores etc.
Comparing the general model [C-SBM] and the common set of weights model
[C-SBM-CW], their essences are totally different. [C-SBM] is used preferred weights of each
UUG, but [C-SBM-CW] is evaluated the common set of weights. In practical applications,
sometimes the UUGs are classified by their properties. For example, bank branches can be
categorized by different regions. In the different region, the levels of economy are not equal.
It could be affect the evaluation of resource (re)allocations. So we can use the different sets
of weights by the different categories of UUGs, and using the common set of weights in the
same categories. In the future research, we would consider the classified UUGs in
(re)allocation problems by merging the idea of [C-SBM] and [C-SBM-CW].
