1、 ABSTRACT 
 
The weld of a butt weld should have a 
certain desired profile for maximum strength. 
The weld must be made to the specifications 
for which it is fabricated. Unacceptable 
profile is a weld defect which produces 
stress concentration that reduces the weld 
strength. Insufficient weld that reduces the 
cross-sectional area of the weld may cause 
premature failure. Excessive convexity acts 
as a stress riser that reduces the fatigue 
strength. Visual inspection is most widely 
used tool to evaluate the weld profile of a 
butt weld. In this study, the reverse 
engineering technique, which a laser 
scanning system integrated with CAD 
software, was used to provide a more 
accurate measurement of a butt weld. The 
sectional profiles of the external weld 
geometry along the weld length were 
generated from the measured points by CAD 
software. The weld specimens were made of 
low-carbon steel plates with groove joint 
using CO2 welding. The weld geometry and 
weld volume were accurately determined 
from the generated CAD model. Also, the 
acceptability of the weld profile based on 
the welding code was evaluated from the 
CAD model. The reverse engineering 
technique provides a more accurate and 
efficient method to measure the external 
geometry of a butt weld.

2、 INTRODUCTION 
 
The butt weld should have a certain 
desired profile for maximum strength. The 
weld profile of butt weld affects not only the 
quality, but also the safety of the structure. 
The weld must be made to the drawings and 
specifications for which it is designed and 
constructed. The external weld geometry 
plays an important role in the acceptability 
of a butt weld, since the weld geometry is 
directly related to the load resistance. The 
weld profile varies along the weld length 
due to minor and unavoidable variations in 
the weld operations. The weld profile has to 
be inspected to confirm the specifications of 
the welding code. For the butt weld, the 
static strength of the weld is based on the

CAD Surface Construction 
The measured cloud points for a weld 
by the laser scanning system were filtered 
and ordered to make structured grid data. A 
B-Spline surface fitting (Lee, 1999) and 
sub-surface connecting technique (Danial, 
1995) were used to re-construct the weld 
surface. The B-Spline surface has the 
characteristic of a local modification and 
also complies with the first- and second- 
order continuity conditions. Hence, the 
B-Spline surface was adopted to construct 
the weld surface. For 44×  control points 
Pij and third degree polynomial basis 
functions, the surface can be represented in 
matrix form as Eq. (1).

For a surface passed 44×  measured

In order to save the computation time 
of large data, the B-Spline fitting integrated 
with sub-surface connecting technique was 
used to construct the weld surface. The CAD 
surface was generated with 44×  control 
points, and a sub-surface or patch that was 
the middle portion of the generated surface 
was chosen as a basis element to form the 
CAD surface. The surface was generated 
sequentially passing through the measured 
points, and the whole CAD surface was 
constructed by connecting sub-surface by 
sub-surface. 
The base line, which represents the 
reference line of weld profile on the base 
plate surface, needs to be identified from the 
cross section of the CAD model. The base 
line L and coordinates (x,y,z) of the model 
are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 also shows the 
generated weld surface W. Theoretically, the 
base line is a linear equation and passed 
every measured points of the base plate. But 
the measured points fluctuate around the 
base line due to the roughness of the base 
plate, it introduces an error between the 
measured points and the line equation. By 
using the least-squares-error technique 
(Mathews, 1987), the line equation to 
represent the base line can be written as

CAD software. Not only the whole weld 
contour can be represented, but also the 
averaged and statistical distribution of weld 
geometry along the weld length can be 
obtained. The weld profile at any location of 
the weld length can also be acquired from 
the CAD model to evaluate the weld quality. 
 
4、EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND 
DISCUSSIONS 
The size of the specimen used in the 
experiment was 65mm (width) × 120mm 
(length) ×  6mm (thickness), and butt 
welding was performed with two parts of 
low carbon steel. An annealing treatment 
was carried out before welding to reduce the 
residual stresses of the plates. The weld 
specimen was fabricated with groove angle 
60∘,  root face 2mm, and groove gap 2mm. 
The CO2 arc welding machine was used 
with 100 percent CO2 as the shielding gas 
and gas flowrate 15 L/min. An electrode 
with a diameter of 1.2mm was used for the 
welding machine, and the electrode 
extension was 15mm. For the welding 
parameters, the welding voltage was fixed at 
24V, the welding speed was chosen at four 
different levels (120, 200, 280,360 mm/min), 
and the welding current was also at four 
different levels (170,200,230,250A). By 
combining the welding parameters, 48 
experiments were performed 3 times each 
under each condition. The laser scanner, 
which was used to measure weld specimens, 
was equipped with a laser diode of 10mW 
power and a band-pass filter of 670nm wave 
length. The point-to-point length on the 
scanning line was 0.5mm, the scanning rate 
was 3000points per second. The calibration 
of the laser scanning system was carried out 
by comparing the dimensions of a 
rectangular gage block (40mm ×  80mm ×  
20mm) obtained by the laser scanner with 
the dimensions of the gage block, and the 
accuracy of the measurement system was 
about 0.05mm. The weld length only 
measured 80mm by the laser scanner, 
excluding the first and last 20mm in which 
the weld part was not stable. The weld 
geometry and weld volume were calculated 
from the generated CAD model of the 
specimen. 
The effect of welding current with the 
welding voltage 24V and welding speeding 
280mm/min on the weld geometry and weld 
volume is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows that 
the weld width, back-weld width, weld 
convexity, and back-weld depth are 
increased as the welding current increased, 
and the standard deviations of weld width 
and convexity are also increased as the 
welding current increased. Fig. 6 also shows 
both the weld bead volume and back-weld 
volume are increased as the welding current 
increased. The effect of welding speed with 
the welding voltage 24V and welding 
current 200A on the welding geometry and 
weld volume is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 
shows that the measured weld geometrical 
dimensions and weld volume are decreased 
as the welding speed increased, while the 
standard deviations of measured weld 
geometry are increased as the welding speed 
increased. 
An example of the measured weld 
profiles for the welding current 200A, 
welding voltage 24V, and welding speed 
280mm/min is shown in Fig. 8. The sections 
of the profiles were located at a 30mm 
spacing, with the first and last section 
positioned 30mm from the ends of the 
120mm weld length. Fig. 8 shows that both 
front and back weld profiles are slightly 
different due to unavoidable variations in the 
welding operations. In Fig. 8, section a-a 
represents 30mm spacing from the weld end, 
section b-b represents 60mm spacing from 
the weld end, and section c-c represents 
90mm spacing from the weld end. The weld 
profiles can be accurately measured at any 
locations along the weld length from the 
generated CAD model. The comparison of 
both front and back weld profiles at the 
mid-length of the weld by three different 
welding current (170,200,230A) with the 
welding voltage 24V and welding speed 
280mm/min is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows 
that the cross sectional area of weld profile 
is increased as the welding current is 
increased. 
The acceptability of weld profiles along 
a weld length based on the welding code 
(American Welding Society, 1994) can be 
evaluated by the generated CAD model of a

Purpose: In order to achieve better performance and quality, the wheel design and manufacturing use a number 
of wheel tests (rotating bending test, radial fatigue test, and impact test) to insure that the wheel meets the 
safety requirements. The test is very time consuming and expensive. Computer simulation of these tests can 
significantly reduce the time and cost required to perform a wheel design. In this study, nonlinear dynamic finite 
element is used to simulate the SAE wheel impact test.
Design/methodology/approach: The test fixture used for the impact test consists of a striker with specified 
weight. The test is intended to simulate actual vehicle impact conditions. The tire-wheel assembly is mounted 
at 13° angle to the vertical plane with the edge of the weight in line with outer radius of the rim. The striker is 
dropped from a specified height above the highest point of the tire-wheel assembly and contacts the outboard 
flange of the wheel.Because of the irregular geometry of the wheel, the finite element model of an aluminium 
wheel is constructed by tetrahedral element. A mesh convergence study is carried out to ensure the convergence 
of the mesh model. The striker is assumed to be rigid elements. Initially, the striker contacts the highest area of 
the wheel, and the initial velocity of the striker is calculated from the impact height. The simulated strains at 
two locations on the disc are verified by experimental measurements by strain gages. The damage parameter of 
a wheel during the impact test is a strain energy density from the calculated result.
Findings: The prediction of a wheel failure at impact is based on the condition that fracture will occur if the 
maximum strain energy density of the wheel during the impact test exceeds the total plastic work of the wheel 
material from tensile test. The simulated results in this work show that the total plastic work can be effectively 
employed as a fracture criterion to predict a wheel fracture of forged aluminum wheel during impact test.
Research limitations/implications: A standard impact load is used to carry out the test. For future study, 
a heavier striker or higher impact can be used to perform the test in order to produce the rupture at impact.
Originality/value: In this study, the nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis is performed to simulate a forged 
aluminium wheel during SAE impact test. The structural damage parameter of the wheel is estimated by the 
strain energy density, and the fracture criterion is based on the total plastic work of the wheel material. Computer 
simulation of wheel impact test can significantly reduce the time and cost required to finalize a wheel design.

1. Introduction 
The wheel being critical component in the vehicle has to meet 
strict requirements of driving safety. The wheel design must meet 
both the styling appearance and engineering functions. The wheel 
also must be durable enough to withstand rough loads and harsh 
environments. Wheel weight and manufacturing cost should be 
minimized without contradicting the safety requirements. The 
wheel design and development use three main wheel tests (rotating 
bending test, radial fatigue test, and impact test) to test a prototype 
wheel for various fatigue and durability considerations[1,2].

Analysis and modelling
Finite element simulation of wheel impact test
The rotating bending test simulates cornering induced loads by 
applying a constant rotating bending moment to the wheel. In the 
radial fatigue test, the wheel and tire assembly is loaded radially 
against a constantly rotating drum. The impact test is established to 
evaluate the impact characteristics of passenger car wheels. 
The time to test and inspect wheel during production is very 
consuming. For economic reasons, it is important to reduce the time 
spending in trial and error during the development and testing phase 
of wheel. Computer simulation of wheel tests can significantly 
reduce the time and cost required to finalize a wheel design. The 
simulation of rotating bending test and radial fatigue test have 
shown good agreement with experimental results[3-5]. Riesner et. 
al.[6] employed three step analysis to simulate the impact test: static, 
dynamic, and fracture mechanics. A static finite element simulation 
is carried out to obtain an effective spring constant of wheel. Then a 
simple model consisting of lumped masses, springs, and dampers is 
performed to simulation the dynamic response. In the third step, the 
peak force acquired the dynamic response is applied to the finite 
element model to calculate the stress and strain energy density. The 
total plastic work is utilized as a damage criterion to predict a wheel 
failure. In this study, the nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis 
is performed to simulate a forged aluminium wheel during SAE 
impact test. The strain, stress, and strain energy density distribution 
are obtained from finite element results. The structural damage 
parameter of the wheel is estimated by the strain energy density, 
and the fracture criterion is based on the total plastic work of the 
wheel material. 
 
2. Modeling for impact test 
 
2.1. Test fixture 
 
The test fixture used for the test, is show in Fig. 1. It consists, 
of a striker of 476 kg with 375 mm length, 125 width, and 
126.94  mm height. The tire-wheel assembly is mounted at 13° 
angle to the horizontal plane with the lower edge of the striker in 
line with the outer bead radius of the rim. The striker is dropped 
from a height of 230±2 mm above the highest point of the tire-
wheel assembly. 
In order to pass the impact test, a wheel must meet the 
following minimum performance standards [2]: 
x No visible fracture of the central member of the wheel assembly. 
x No separation of the central member from the rim. 
x No sudden loss of tire air pressure. 
x Deformation of the wheel assembly, or fracture in the area of 
the rim section contracted by the faceplate weight system do not 
constitute a failure. 
 
2.2. Finite element model 
 
The diameter of the tested wheel is 17 inch. Due to the 
symmetry of the geometry, loading, and boundary conditions, 
only one half of the wheel is modeled. The mesh model is 
constructed by free mesh, because of the irregular geometry of the 
wheel. The wheel is built with tetrahedral elements. The striker 
and support are created with hexahedral elements. Symmetric 
constraints are imposed on the symmetric plane of the structure. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Fixture for wheel impact test 
 
The nodes at the contacted surface between the wheel and support 
are constrained to move together. The striker is modeled as a rigid 
body. The displacement of striker is constrained to move in vertical 
direction. In addition, the bottom surface of support is fixed to 
prevent the rigid body motion. The finite element model for wheel 
impact test is shown in Fig. 2, where the mesh size of the wheel is 
6 mm. The mesh model data in Fig. 2 are shown in Table 1.

2.3. Material modelling 
 
The wheel is modelled as an elasto-plastic and isotropic 
material. The material properties of wheel are obtained from the 
tensile test. The support and cushion are modelled as elastic and 
isotropic materials. The material properties of support and cushion 
are obtained from material handbook. The material properties used 
in finite element model are shown in Table 2, where E is the elastic 
modulus, Ȟ is Poisson’s ratio, ȡ is density, ıt is the true stress, and İp 
is the plastic strain. The friction coefficient between the contact 
surface of the weight and wheel is 0.3. 
 
 
2.4. Mesh convergence study 
 
Commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit is 
utilized to carry out the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the wheel 
impact test. At the beginning of the simulation, the striker is 
located at the highest location of the wheel. The initial velocity of 
the striker is V0, which can be calculate by Eq. (1). 
ghV 20   (1) 
Where g is acceleration due to gravity and h is the impact height. 
A mesh convergence study has been done to ensure that the 
displacement at the contact point between the striker and wheel is 
convergent. The automatic incremental time step is used to 
calculate the dynamic response. Several mesh sizes of the wheel 
are performed. The displacement responses for various mesh sizes 
are shown in Fig. 3. It shows that the displacement response is 
almost convergent for mesh size 7 mm. In this study, the wheel 
model is constructed by mesh size 6 mm, which is about the size 
of the strain gage used in the strain measurement.

3. Results and discussions 
 
3.1. Fracture criterion 
 
Visual inspection of a failed wheel usually shows some plastic 
deformation and a distinct surface of rapid fracture. The failure of 
a wheel can be classified as a ductile fracture. The fracture 
criterion of a tested wheel is base on the total plastic work Wp, 
which can be calculated as Eq. (2).

Where İf is the fracture strain in tensile test,ıt is the true stress, 
andİp is the plastic strain. 
The stress-strain relationship of the studied wheel is described as 
Eq. (3).  npt k HV   (3)

Then, Wp can be calculated by Eq. (4).

 (4) 
Where ıf is the true stress at fracture from the tensile test. The 
critical strain energy density necessary for the wheel fracture can 
be determined from Eq. (4). For the studied wheel, the values of İf, 
ıf, and n are obtained from the tensile test, that İf = 0.131,  
ıf  = 330.6 MPa, and n = 0.051. The critical strain energy density 
for the wheel equals Wp = 41.21 Nmm/mm3. 
 
3.2. Strain response 
 
The strain gages were attached on the wheel disc to measure 
the strain of the wheel during impact test. Two rosette strain gages 
(EA-06-060R2, Micro-Measurements) were used. The locations 
of two gages are labeled as L1 and L2 in Fig. 4. For the validation 
of the simulation results, the estimated strains for the wheel were 
compared with the measured strains. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the 
first principal strain during the impact test for both methods. The 
FE results show the similar tendencies with the measured strains. 
The difference of measured and estimated maximum first prince-
pal strain for L1 is about 9.9%, and the difference for L2 is about 
10.6%. The deviation of the finite element result may be that the 
time step used to calculate the dynamic response is not small 
enough to take into consideration of the higher frequency modes. 
 
3.3 Strain energy density distribution 
 
The strain energy density distribution of the wheel at the end 
of the first impact is shown in Fig. 7. The higher strain energy 
density distribution is located at the contact area and disc surface 
as indicated in the figure, and the maximum value is at the contact 
area. The estimated maximum value, 28.46 Nmm/mm3, is below 
the critical level, 42.21 Nmm/mm3. The wheel should pass the 
impact test based on the ductile fracture criterion. The tested 
wheel passed the real test. The visual examination of the tested 
wheel showed no crack and obvious plastic deformation at the 
contact area and around higher strain energy density area.
