1. Introduction
Warranty is an important factor of marketing products because a better warranty
policy usually signals the higher product quality and provides greater assurance to
buyers. However, warranty always involves additional costs to the seller and these
costs depend on product reliability (Noll, 2004; Chukova et al. 2004). If the seller
promises to renew or repair products when failures occur, the commitment length of
warranty and the reliability of the product, which is related to its failure time
distribution, play a key role on deciding the total cost of the product. Two types of
warranty policies have been widely applied in practice: replacement warranty policy
and pro-rata warranty policy. For a replacement warranty policy, the seller is required
to either repair the product or provide a new product at no cost to the buyer from the
time of initial purchase. Such a policy is usually offered with repairable products.
Pro-rata warranty policy requires the seller to provide replacement at some cost,
which is called pro-rata cost, to the buyer. Pro-rata cost can be either a linear or
non-linear function of the remaining time in the warranty length. Combination of the
replacement and pro-rate warranty policies is also common because it has a
significant promotional value to the seller while at the same time providing adequate
control over costs for both buyer and seller in most applications (Blischke and Murhy
1996; Mitra and Patankar 1997; Wu, Chou and Huang 2007). However, there are the
types of warranties typically offered on a wide range of products, and they usually
involve purchases of one or, at most, a few items (Guin 1984, Blischke and Murthy
1992; Blischke and Murthy 1996;Yun, Lee and Ferreira 2002). Cumulative warranties
which the warranty covers the total service time of an entire batch of items have been
proposed as an alternative. The general structure of cumulative warranty is that the
product is sold in batches of n items and, rather than providing a warranty of length w
on each individual item, the batch as a whole is warranted to provide a total service
time of nw units. Under a cumulative combination under cumulative combination free
replacement and pro-rate warranty policy, replacements would be provided free until a
total service time of 1nw (where 1w is the length of the free replacement on a single
item), and at pro rate cost if the total service time exceeded nw1 but was less than
nw .
Burn-in can be considered as a part of the production process in which the
manufactured products are operated under accelerated stresses for a short time period,
which is called burn-in time, before their release. The principal motivation of burn-in
is to detect the situation that latent defects exist in the early stage of introducing
products. Burn-in has been applied as a way for enhancing product reliability
(Nguyen and Murthy 1982; Wu and Croome 2007). According to Nguyen and Murthy

non-repairable products, the burn-in cost per unit is:

where C1 is the fixed set up cost of burn-in per unit of product and C2 is the burn-in
cost per unit of product per unit time. Based on Equation (1), Nguyen and Murthy
(1982) has shown that the expected manufacturing cost per unit of product with
burn-in time b, denoted by M(b), is

2.2. Warranty cost
In this section, the warranty cost for product with warranty length w, lot size n and
burn-in time b under cumulative combined free replacement and pro-rate warranty
policy is developed. According to Wald’s renewal equation (1970), the expected 
warranty cost, denoted by E[W(w, n, b)], is equal to the expected warranty cost per
replacement, denoted by ))(( tE  , multiplied by the expected number of replacements,
denoted by E[N(w,n)], in the time interval [0, nw]. That is,
)]([)],([)],,([ tEnwNEbnwWE  . (3)
For non-repairable products, it can be shown that the expected free replacement
frequency followed by a renewal process constitutes a renewal equation. We assume
that the seller is required to provide a new product at no cost to the buyer from the
time of initial purchase. Then, free replacements are provided until a product having a
life of at least nw is found. Let N(w, n) be the number of free replacements for a sold
product during the time interval [0, nw]. By assuming that the failure time of the
products is independently and identically distributed with the cumulative distribution
function F(w). Thus, the number of replacements required to satisfy the warranty
conditions is a random variable having a geometric distribution. The probability
distribution of N(w, n) is

2.3. Total mean cost
Let ),,( bnwC denote the total mean cost per unit of product sold with the
burn-in time b, lot size n and warranty length w. Based on Equations (2) and (9), the
total mean cost of the product is
- 7 -
set as follows: 50 C , 2.01 C , timeofunit/52 C , and 103 C . The solution
procedures for Policies I and II are shown in Table 2 and Figures 3.
****** Table 2 and Figures 3 are about here. ******
5. Conclusions
In this project, a cost function is developed to determine the optimal burn-in
time and warranty length for the non-repairable products under cumulative
combination warranty. Grid-search approach is applied to obtain the solution of the
problem. Numerical examples are provided given that the failure time of the product
follows the mixed exponential distribution and the mixed Weibull distribution. Based
on the results of analysis, the following observations may be summarized:
1. There should be burn-in due to high cost.
2. The policy II leads to a higher cost than the policy I.
3. For both the typical free replacement and pro-rata warranty policy and the
fully free renewing policy, there should be long burn-in time due to high cost.
4. For both the typical free replacement and pro-rata warranty policy and the
fully free renewing policy, an increasing lot size leads to an increasing cost.
5. For n=2 and 5, an increasing warranty length leads to an increasing cost. For
n=9, an increasing warranty length leads to a declining cost.
6. The fully free renewing warranty policy leads to a higher cost than the fully
free renewing policy.
7. Total mean cost for the mixed exponential distributed failure time leads to a
higher cost than total mean cost for the mixed Weibull distributed failure
time.

Warranty always involves additional costs to the seller and these costs usually
depend on product reliability. Burn-in is considered as a part of the production
process in which the manufactured products are operated under accelerated stresses
for a short time period before their release and has been applied as a way for
enhancing product reliability. In this paper, a cost model is developed to determine
the optimal burn-in time and warranty length under cumulative warranty policy.
Cumulative warranties which the warranty covers the total service time of an entire
batch of items have been proposed as an alternative. Denoting w as the warranty
length of the product, under cumulative combination free replacement and pro-rate
warranty, the seller agrees to replace the product that fails prior to the time point nw1
from the time of purchase with a new product at no cost to the buyer. From time nw1
to nw2 after purchase, any product that fails is replaced at pro-rate cost to the buyer,
and the warranty begins a new. Some conclusions will be drawn based on the
analysis.

5the standard free replacement, pro-rata, and combination structures previously
analyzed. The failure time distribution of the product is assumed to follow the mixed
exponential distribution. The mixed exponential distribution is commonly used in
burn-in analysis (e.g., Chou and Tang 1992, Yun et al. 2002; Sheu and Chien 2005).
In this paper, the cost model under burn-in and cumulative combination free
replacement and pro-rate warranty policy is developed. Some conclusions will be
drawn based on the analysis.
2. The cost model
The cost model under burn-in and FRW/PRW policy is presented. The total mean
cost of the product includes its manufacturing cost and warranty cost.
2.1. Manufacturing cost
Let b be the burn-in time of the product, T be the random variable describing
the failure time of the product, and F(t) be the cumulative distribution function of the
failure time of product for 0t . Then the probability that a unit of product survives
at the burn-in time is )(1 bF . According to Nguyen and Murthy (1982), for general
non-repairable products, the burn-in cost per unit is:
bttCC  ,21 , if the item fails at age t during burn-in
btbCC  ,21 , if the survives the burn-in
And the expected burn-in cost per unit is

where C1 is the fixed set up cost of burn-in per unit of product and C2 is the burn-in
cost per unit of product per unit time. Based on Equation (1), Nguyen and Murthy
(1982) has shown that the expected manufacturing cost per unit of product with
burn-in time b, denoted by M(b), is

2.2. Warranty cost
In this section, the warranty cost for product with warranty length w, lot size n and
burn-in time b under cumulative combined free replacement and pro-rate warranty
policy is developed. According to Wald’s renewal equation (1970), the expected
warranty cost, denoted by E[W(w, n, b)], is equal to the expected warranty cost per
replacement, denoted by ))(( tE  , multiplied by the expected number of replacements,
7(1997). Smaller values of k and indicate that the seller will shoulder a lower
warranty cost; meanwhile, larger values of k and  lead to a higher warranty cost for
the seller. Figure 1 depicts the general relationship between warranty cost and time
under cumulative combination free replacement and pro rate warranty (FRW/PRW)
policy. During the time interval [ 1nw , nw], the lump-sum amount of 3kC is offered to
the buyer.
