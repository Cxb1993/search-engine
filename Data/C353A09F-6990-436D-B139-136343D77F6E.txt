2.Experimental
We adopt the thermal evaporation of the
physics vapor method to prepare the different size
of Ag nanoparticles. The synthesis process was
carried out under the pressure of 5×10-6 torr and
the nitrogen gas was used as the reaction gas. We
injected liquid nitrogen into the collection plate
until the temperature down to 77K. A cup of
500ml liquid nitrogen was added every ten
minutes in order to maintain the low temperature
until the heating process finished. Then we turned
on the electric current switch and increased the
electric current slowly. While the tungsten boat
turned a little bit red, we stopped to increase the
electric current. At this time, the metal Ag pellets
got fuse and turned into spherical shape slowly.
Finally, we use the glass slice to shave down the
powder in order to collect the Ag nanoparticles.
The morphology, structure, and optical properties
of Ag nanoparticles are studied by X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-Visible
spectrophotometer (UV/Vis spectrophotometer),
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
measurements.
3.Results and disscussions
The X-ray diffraction patterns of silver
nanoparticles prepared under different inert gas
pressure are showed in Fig.1. They show the pure
silver phase with main diffractive peak（111）、
（200）、（220）and（310）. We can confirm the
prepared nanoparticles are Ag. After evaporating
was finished, the silver nanoparticle powders had
different colors on the collection plate. There are
three different colors for Ag nanoparticles. One is
grey, the others are black and red coppery. It is
due to the different size of nanoparticles resulted
in the color changed. We controled the particle
size of Ag by adjusting of the inert gas pressure
from 0.1 torr to 4 torr. TEM was used to

investigate the nanostructure of the silver
particles and the images are showed in Fig.2 to
Fig.4. Figure 2 shows the TEM images of silver
nanoparticles obtained under the inert gas
pressure equal to 0.1torr (Fig.2(a)) and 0.5torr
(Fig.2(b)). They show that the particles have
bigger size and have no spherical shape. That
appeared the long chain shape and cluster
seriously. The particles size was from 30 nm to
70nm on average, approximately. The color under
this pressure range was black. Figure 3 shows the
TEM images of silver nanoparticles obtained
under the inert gas pressure equal to 1.0 torr
(Fig.3(a)) and 2.0 torr (Fig.3(b)). They show that
the particles have smaller size and spherical
shape. It appeared the cluster shape, but we can
see the single particle clearly. The particles size
was from 6 nm to 11 nm on average,
approximately. The colors under this pressure
range were black and red coppery. Figure 4 shows
the TEM images of silver nanoparticles obtained
under the inert gas pressure equal to
3.0torr(Fig.4(a)) and 4.0 torr (Fig.4(a)). It
4particles size is no longer diminished. It is due to
the particles size is on critical dimension, and the
smallest size is obtained when the environment is
stable. The particles size is got bigger while the
environment is unstable. In optical characteristic,
we measured the peak appeared the red shift
(from 381nm to 458nm) when the particles size
were changed from big to small. This
phenomenon is caused by the surface effect in the
physical characteristic of nanoparticles. From the
results of X-ray diffraction patterns and TEM
images, we can prove that the Ag nanoparticles
have been made by thermal evaporation method.
