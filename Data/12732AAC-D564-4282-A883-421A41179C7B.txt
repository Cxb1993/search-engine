these works are concentrated on the simulation [17-18] or on the electrical single track 
cart-seesaw system [16]; that is, it does not address two tracks pneumatic cart-seesaw 
platform. 
The fuzzy logic controller (FLC) based on learning accomplishes its learning for a given 
control task through repetition or sequence of operations. The rule modification mechanism 
monitors the control performance at every trial and makes the rule base change if the 
performance at every trial and makes the rule base change if the performance is not 
satisfactory [17]. However, the design of fuzzy controllers is often a time-consuming activity 
that depends on knowledge acquisition, the definition of the controller structure, and the 
definition of rules and other parameters [19]. Hence, how to construct the fuzzy rule base and 
define the fuzzy controller parameters is a challenge problem for controller design. Moreover, 
due to the complexity task foe a MIMO control problem, it needs to decompose the system 
into several tasks. Then constructing a supervisory coordinator handles subsystem interactions. 
Thus, decomposition and coordination are the conventional method and important data in the 
study on the SAMS [20]. The coordination fuzzy rule set is used to adjust the correction 
factors of FLC to achieve better performance. 
Hence, this work, an extension of our previous work [14], generates a new fuzzy 
balancing controller (FBC) for such cart-seesaw system. In addition, this study incorporates a 
fuzzy coordinator into the system to take control action in extreme situations. The passive 
counterweight mass also provides passive damping, and enhances the active action authority. 
The experimental apparatus is used to assess the efficiency of the proposed scheme. 
 
2. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION 
The description of the system configuration is the similar to the reference [15]. Figure 1 
schematically depicts a cart-seesaw system. Figure 2 indicates some important devices for 
such system. Two carts which are able to move along the rails are installed on top of the 
seesaw modules, one on each module. The experimental pneumatic system comprised two 
pneumatic rodless cylinders, each 510 mm long, four controlled proportional valves, and a 
compressed air source. The air supplied to the cylinder was controlled by an 
electro-pneumatic transducer that provided air pressure proportional to supplied voltage. 
Each motion direction was selected by appropriate actuation of the 3/2-way electro-valves

3. DYNAMIC MODELING 
This section introduces a mathematical model of the cart-seesaw system, as acquired 
from known dynamics. Figure 3 shows the proposed cart-seesaw system. Carts 1 and 2 
sliding along the seesaw have one and two degrees of freedom, respectively, which are 
actuated by a pneumatic proportional control valve. The angles of the seesaw and 
counterweight mass are the third and fourth degrees of freedom, respectively, which are not 
actuated.

The mass of sliding carts 1 and 2 be 1m  and 2m , respectively. Moreover, the moment 
of inertia of the seesaw be J, and the gravitational acceleration be g. The counterweight 
mass, 3m , with length 3l  is attached underneath the seesaw and serves as the vibration 
damper absorbing impact and shock energy [15]. Consequently, the entire system can be 
divided into the following four subsystems: cart 1; cart 2; the counterweight mass; and 
seesaw. Thus, the kinetic energy and potential energy for each subsystem can be computed 
and the global dynamic equations can then be derived. The detailed derivation for the 
dynamic formulation is indicated as Appendix.
After selecting slide carts positions 1x  and 2x , seesaw angle θ   as generalized 
system coordinates, and by using the Lagrangian formulation, the dynamic equations can be 
rewritten as

seesaw, and the output is the slope of the seesaw. In real system, it is very difficult to find 
the exact mathematical models. For such the case of an unstable nonlinear model, it is 
possible to linearize a nonlinear model and to make the linear model stable by using linear 
control techniques. Therefore, to make the seesaw system prior to fuzzy rule base 
construction, it is necessary to use linear control technique to investigate the system 
performance. 
Firstly, an approximated linearize model will be investigated for linear controller design. 
Next, the state feedback controller by near-optimized designing LQR plus integrator with 
the approximated linearized model. Finally, we tune the fuzzy controller by the linearized 
controller performance with the real nonlinear plant.  
Suppose that the realization of an equilibrium-to-equilibrium transfer maneuver of the 
sliding cart is required in a finite time interval ],[ fi tt  . This is achieved by introducing a 
controlled displacement from a given initial equilibrium positions, )(* itq , towards a 
second equilibrium position, )(* ftq  [14].  
Consider the nonlinear system from Eq. (1) and by defining the state vector

),( uxfx =& ,  0)0( xx =                                        ( 3) 
where x(0) is the initial condition of the state vector. 
To ensure notational and analytical simplicity in linear system analysis and design, the 
linear system equations are often transferred such that the nominal (equilibrium) point is the 
origin of the state-space, then.

Significantly, for 0=ε , the nonlinear system (4) becomes linear, while for 1=ε , the

obtained by assuming that 0=ε . 
Without loss of generality, the cost function is assumed to be quadratic:

of the past operations so that the past operations so that the outputs can follow the given 
target trajectories as closely as possible. As an assistant controller, the PID controller easily 
made the linear system stable. Next, the fuzzy controller rule base was constructed based on 
the PID performance knowledge. Then a fuzzy Mamdani-type model is built to approximate 
the cart-seesaw system in a small range of angle near its equilibrium state. According to the 
Mamdani model, a fuzzy controller is designed to balance the seesaw and to position the 
cart at the desired location. 
Let the input fuzzy variables seesaw angle e ( de θθ −= ) and its rate e&  ( de θθ &&& −= ) be 
fuzzily partitioned into five fuzzy sets, Large Negative (NL), Small Negative (SN), Zero 
(ZE), Small Positive (SP), Large Positive (LP). For the output variable u is partitioned into 
five fuzzy sets, Large Negative (NL), Small Negative (SN), Zero (ZE), Small Positive (SP), 
Large Positive (LP). Membership function parameters are tuned offline according to heuristic 
rules. The parameters for the membership functions of the main fuzzy logic controller are 
shown in Fig. 4. The heuristic rules are derived from the operator’s knowledge and 
experience of the linearized physical system. The following heuristic rules are suggested in 
this research [21]: 
1. System starting up, change the control input in response to the set-point change; 
2. Tracking error not changing ( e&  is ZE), change control input accordingly; 
3. Moving along, maintain control input; 
4. Performance getting worse, reverse control input somewhat; 
5. Tracking error changing ( e& ) too fast, adjust input somewhat; 
6. Tracking error (e) is nil and changing ( e& ) insignificantly, no action; 
7. Tracking error (e) is nil and changing ( e& ) insignificantly, no action — wait and see. 
In this study, the design of membership functions is using the middle of a narrow type. 
By the middle of a narrow type of membership function, the probability of the input 
variables into the ZE zone is less than into the SN and SP zone. This can improve the 
processing efficiency for the input variables in ZE zone and get a good response rate.  
There are two dynamic objects in the cart-seesaw system, which are the carts and the 
seesaw. It would be easier to consider the controls of the cart and seesaw separately for the 
designs of the controllers with the rule base mechanism. However, there are only two 
control actions allowed for the cart-seesaw system. Therefore, the local control action 1u

The idea to control the balancing of the seesaw is to manipulate the carts that make the 
seesaw remain on the horizontal. For example, if the state of the seesaw angle is SN and the 
state of the seesaw angle rate is LP, a SP control action is provided to the cart. Since the 
system consist two carts, therefore, the main control action should be decomposed into two 
local control actions to drive the two carts and maintain the seesaw on the horizontal. Hence, 
a fuzzy coordinator is constructed to deal with the carts interactions and makes a supervisory 
decision to the control action (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5 Fuzzy balancing control structure of the cart-seesaw system 
 
At the compensation level, the information from each subsystem is taken as input to the 
coordinator. The coordinator, which is based linguistic syntax variables of system 
performance, adjusts the weighting factors of the fuzzy controller to achieve a better 
balancing performance in case of changes in system parameters. To coordinate the 
compensation system, the fuzzy coordinator takes  21 xx −  ( e∆ ) and 21 xx && −  ( e&∆ ) as inputs 
to generate the weighting factors m and n. Hence, the compensation level controller monitors 
these differences and causes the supervisory decision to be fed to the main controller. The 
wighting factors m and n and m+n=1 are generated by the fuzzy coordinator is multiplied with 
the main controls u, respectively.

performance even in the case of unexpected changes in system parameters. 
  
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
An experimental apparatus was constructed and presented (Fig. 6). The cart-seesaw 
system consists of two mobile carts, which are coupled via rack and pinion mechanics to 
two parallel tracks mounted on pneumatic rodless cylinders. One cart carries an unknown 
payload, while the other one serves as a counterbalance to keep the seesaw on the 
equilibrium state. Four solenoid proportional direction control valves were used to drive the 
two double-acting pneumatic rodless cylinders. The controller of the cart-seesaw system is 
composed of two National Instruments (NIs) Data Acquisition (DAQ) boards (the 
PCI-MIO-16E-4 and PCI-6174) and a host personal computer. The real-time software 
interface of the controller board permits rapid control prototyping using LabVIEW, thereby 
enabling a quick implementation of the proposed control approach using the real-time block 
model applied in LabVIEW.

Case 2 Initial Position of Cart at end of the seesaw 
Figure 9 plots the time response for seesaw angle of case 2 under various 3l . In this 
case, one cart carries an unknown from the end of the seesaw. Thus, the other cart functions 
as a counterbalance. As a result, the seesaw angle should be close to zero to keep the seesaw 
in the equilibrium state while the carts slide. The proposed FLC reduces seesaw angle due 
to tilt resulting from PID by approximately 12.4–36.7% for various 3l  (Table 3). Once 
again, the performance of the active fuzzy control is relatively unaffected by any change in 
counterweight mass length 3l . Hence, experimental results support the same conclusion as 
that for vibration suppression in Case 1.

the carts slide. The normalized RMS seesaw angle was around 4.52–16.07 when 
implementing counterweight mass passive damping and active PID control (Table 4). In

coordinator into the system to take control action in extreme situations. Experimental results 
indicate that utilizing the fuzzy controller incorporates coordinator compensation 
significantly enhances the performance. The performance of the proposed fuzzy control 
scheme is relatively unaffected by any change in counterweight mass length 3l . The 
performance of fuzzy controller is not significantly affected by changes the environmental 
parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller in minimizing the 
seesaw tilt angle in the time domain even when the system is caused by unexpected loading 
change. Experimental responses show that the proposed FLC is robust to the parameter 
variation. Although this work is motivated by an exploration cart-seesaw balancing problem, 
then the results of this study can be applied to underactuated mechanical system in which 
the dimensions of the configuration space exceed the dimensions of the control input space. 
Furthermore, development the proposed software/hardware platform can be profitable for 
standardizing laboratory equipment, and the development of entertainment tools.

SUMMARY
This investigation describes the mechanical configuration
and control environment for a novel cart-seesaw system. This
mechanism is called a super articulated mechanical system
(SAMS). The system comprises a cart that slides on the
pneumatic rodless cylinder. The rodless cylinder is double-
acting with the carrier bracket, on which a cart is a pinion
mechanism for the tracks. The cart-seesaw system brings
the cart from any initial position to a desired position on
the seesaw by applying an appropriate force to the cart and
thus adjusting the angle of the seesaw. The position of a cart
denotes the first degree of freedom, which is activated by a
pneumatic proportional valve, and the angle of the seesaw
indicates the second degree of freedom that is not actuated.
Consequently, the proposed new pneumatic cart-seesaw
system is straightforward to construct and direct to operate
in different scenarios of performance. A state feedback
controller is applied for stabilization of the equilibrium
point of the system. Moreover, this study adds a supervisory
controller that takes control action in extreme situations. Test
results reveal excellent properties in control performance.
The proposed product can be extensively applied in SAMS
and pneumatic control for robotics control laboratory.
KEYWORDS: Robots; Ball-and-beam; Cart-seesaw system.
1. Introduction
Underactuated mechanisms have recently attracted signific-
ant attention, owing to their ability not only to represent a rich
class of control system from a control stand point but also to
reduce the cost of robots by decreasing the link mass and the
number of robot actuators.1 In contrast to the system with full
controls, a super articulated mechanical system (SAMS) is
a controlled underactuated mechanical system in which the
dimension of the configuration space exceeds the dimension
of the control input space. For example, inverted pendulum
on a cart, ball and beam problem, mass sliding on a cart
and robots with joint elasticity, underactuated bipedal robot,
nonholonomic mobile robot, etc., all is SAMS.2
A super-articulated mechanical system presents challenges
that are not found in a system with full controls, in which the
dimensions of the configuration space equals the dimension
of the control input space. For instance, controllability is not
easy to determine locally in an SAMS, since it is generally

implied in a system with full control. Control synthesis is
also more complex in an SAMS than in a system with
full control.3 Literature4–6 on motion planning and control
of nonholonomic systems has indicated the difficult yet
interesting features of control synthesis for SAMS.
Control design for underactuated bipedal robot is a
fascinating topic in robotics.7,8 A planar underactuated
bipedal robot with an impulsive foot model is considered
in ref. [7]. A feedback design method is proposed that
integrates actuation in the single and double support phases.
Nevertheless, this paper presents a simple feedback control
design with no supervisory control to take control action
in extreme situations. Similarly, the robust control of
underactuated bipeds using sliding modes is demonstrated
in ref. [8]. A sliding mode control law has been developed
for the biped to follow a human-like gait trajectory while
keeping the torso nearly upright. The control law is too
complicated to understand for the undergraduate students.
Moreover, it lacks experimental implementation to verify the
control algorithms.
The ball-and-beam system is a common undergraduate
control laboratory experiment.9 Control of the ball-and-beam
system has been widely discussed in teaching and research
literature—many classical control solutions can be found on
the Internet and in introductory control textbooks. However,
discovering a control law to stabilize the system remains an
active topic of research discussion.
The ball-and-beam mechanism generally comprises a
beam with a ball on it. The ball rolls on the beam according
to the changing angle of the beam. A ball moving on a beam
is a typical nonlinear dynamic system, which is often adapted
to proof-test diverse control methods.10 Such a system may
be adopted as a control-training tool by engineering students
to test industrial processes and their applications.
Moreover, the “ball and the beam” system is well
documented as an example of a system that requires an
active control system to maintain the ball at a desired
beam position. Several approaches have been presented to
control the ball-and-beam system during the past decades,
for example, input–output feedback linearization,10 robust
nonlinear control,11,12 and fuzzy logic control.13–15 However,
all of the above papers are based on the same conventional
ball-on-beam plant, in which the ball is rolling on the beam
according to the changing angle of the beam. The system
lacks a new mechanism for other control purposes.
Pneumatic cylinders are sometimes considered to offer
a better alternative to electrical or hydraulic actuators for

cart moves to the center of the seesaw. This point is called
the equilibrium point. However, due to the bias or loading
unbalance disturbances existing in the original mechanism,
the sensor for equilibrium point cannot accurately show the
zero value. To solve this problem, an adjustable weight rod
was installed as a counterbalance. This mechanism is called
static balance apparatus. The counterweight modification
method can guarantee that the seesaw angle equals zero
when the cart position is located at the center of the seesaw.
However, sensor system must adapt their sensing value
during the experiment.
Furthermore, the seesaw falls to the definite direction
instantaneously if the cart runs to a particular place,
thus creating instantaneous dynamic instability. Hence, in
dynamical improvement aspect, several torsion springs are
installed underneath the seesaw to serve as a damping
mechanism to absorb the impact and shock energy. Two
torsion springs are installed underneath the seesaw in such
a system. Figure 3 depicts the visualization of this cart-
seesaw system, and indicates some important devices in such
a system.

2.2. Rotation center and center of gravity
The designation of the rotation center determines the
dynamic stability of the whole system. An inappropriately
positioned rotation leads to an inherently unstable system.
Hence, the overall cart-seesaw system can tilt while the cart
is sliding. As revealed in Fig. 4, the distance of the rotation
center to the center of gravity of the cart-seesaw system is
l. The cart should move to the right as the seesaw rotates
counterclockwise with angle θ to prevent the seesaw from
tilting to the left. The distance between the cart and the
rotation center is assumed to be r in this case. To prevent the
cart-seesaw system from tilting, the moment of the clockwise
side should be greater than that of the counterclockwise side.
The resulting equation has the following form:
mg(r cos θ − l sin θ) > Wl sin θ (1)
where W denotes the total weight of the seesaw, and m
represents the sliding cart.
Therefore, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as
mgr cos θ > (mg sin θ + W sin θ)l. (2)
Equation (2) demonstrates that a longer distance between
the center of gravity and the rotation center l requires a
larger value for r , i.e, the distance between the cart and
the center of gravity. However, the mass of the sliding cart
m is much smaller than the total weight of the seesaw W
(mg W ). Therefore, the rotation center and the center
of gravity are collocated on the same line in the proposed
system, so that the distance between the center of gravity
and the rotation center l is very small (l  0). This coincides
with the requirement of Eq. (2), and can enhance the dynamic
stability and prevent the cart-seesaw system from tilting.
Hence, the mechanical configuration follows this concept to
set up the system (Fig. 5).

Pneumatic cart-seesaw system 223
4. Controller Design
The grey theory used in ref. [24] to optimize the parameters of
a PID controller for a robotic manipulator attached to a com-
pliant base (one of SAMS types). Such a system is known as
the macro–micro system, characterized by the number of con-
trol actuators being less than the number of state variables.
However, the methodology requires a limited known data and
needs to investigate the sensitivity of the control parameters,
and then to predict the PID controller parameters. Therefore,
a different approach will be proposed for stabilization of
the equilibrium point of the system in this section: a state
feedback controller [linear quadratic regulator (LQR)] plus a
supervisory controller that will take control action in extreme
situations for such a new pneumatic cart-seesaw system.
4.1. State feedback controller
Suppose that the realization of an equilibrium-to-equilibrium
transfer maneuver of the sliding block is required in a
finite time interval [ti , tf ]. This is achieved by introducing
a controlled displacement from given initial equilibrium
positions, (r(ti), θ(ti)), toward a second equilibrium position,
(r(tf ), θ(tf )).
To ensure notational and analytical simplicity in linear
system analysis and design, the linear system equations
are often transferred such that the nominal (equilibrium)
point is the origin of the state-space. The same action
can be performed for nonlinear systems about a specific
equilibrium point. Assume that the nominal (equilibrium)
point of interest is x∗. The second equation in Eq. (4) yields
the following implicit differential equation for the required
nominal angular displacement, θ∗(t), in terms of the nominal
longitudinal displacement, r∗(t).
(Mr∗(t)2 + J ) ¨θ∗(t) + 2Mr∗(t)r˙∗(t) ˙θ∗(t)
+ Mgr∗(t) cos θ∗(t) + kθ∗(t) = 0. (6)
Then, by introducing a new variable
x1,δ = r − r∗, x2,δ = r˙ − r˙∗, x3,δ = θ − θ∗,
x4,δ = ˙θ − ˙θ∗, uδ = τ − τ ∗.
The linearization of the system around the nominal
trajectory (r∗, r˙∗, θ∗, ˙θ∗, τ ∗) is of the form
x˙δ = Axδ + Buδ + εh(xδ, uδ) (7)
where xδ = [x1,δ x2,δ x3,δ x4,δ]T , A= ( ∂f (x,τ )∂x )(x = 0,τ = 0),
B = ( ∂f (x,τ )
∂τ
)(x = 0,τ = 0), and h ∼= f (x, τ ) − Axδ − Buδ . ε ∈
[0, 1] is a scalar parameter.
Significantly, for ε = 0, the nonlinear system in Eq. (5)
becomes linear, while for ε = 1, the linearized system in
Eq. (7) corresponds to the original system. The control gain
is easily obtained by assuming that ε = 0.
The following well-known approach is employed for a
continuous linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Let the constant
matrices Q and R be nonnegative and positive-definite,
respectively. Define the performance index as
J (xδ, uδ) =
∞∫
0
(
xTδ Qxδ + uTδ Ruδ
)
dt (8)
and the minimization problem as the task of finding an
optimal control u∗δ (•), which minimizes J . To ensure the
solvability of the problem, the pair (A, B) is required to
be stabilizable. Therefore, the optimal control at time t is
uniquely given by the control law
u∗δ (t) =−R−1BT Kxδ(t) (9)
where matrix K denotes the solution to the algebraic matrix
Riccati equation (AMRE)
AT K + KA − KBR−1BT K + Q= 0. (10)
Hence, this investigation develops a linear state feedback
controller for the stabilization of the linearized system, with
the form
uδ =−kT xδ =−k1x1,δ − k2x2,δ − k3x3,δ − k4x4,δ (11)
with feedback gains {k1, k2, k3, k4} selected so that the
characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system matrix,
computed as d(λ) = det[λI − A + BkT ], exhibits constant
coefficients that coincide with those of a Hurwitz polynomial
of the form d(λ) = λ4 + γ4λ3 + γ3λ2 + γ2λ + γ1, whose
roots are strictly in the left-half complex plane. Therefore,
the main control action based on LQR is the PD controller.
However, for nonzero values of ε, Eq. (7) represents
a nonlinear problem whose solution is typically difficult
to obtain. Some near-optimum control designs have been
developed to resolve this difficulty.25 Nevertheless, the
derivation procedure shown in those studies are laborious and
time-consuming, particularly for a process with a nonlinear
system. Hence, to avoid tedious and time-consuming tasks,
the proposed system incorporates a supervisory controller.
4.2. Design of the supervisory controller
This section lists the details of how to construct a
supervisory controller for a nonlinear control system where
the state feedback controller already exists, and proposes
modifications to the supervisory control such that it gradually
switches to the supervisory mode. More specifically, this
investigation designs a controller whose main control action
is uδ , and with a closed-loop system that is globally stable
in the sense that the state x is uniformly bounded, i.e.,
|x(t)| ≤Mxδ , ∀t > 0, where Mxδ denotes a constant given by
the designer.
For this task, a supervisory controller us , which is nonzero
only when the state x hits the boundary of the constraint set
{x : |x| ≤ Mxδ }, we append the PD controller uδ. Thus, the
control law is
u=uδ + I ∗us (12)
where the indicator function I ∗ = 1 if |x| ≥ Mxδ , and I ∗ = 0
if |x|<Mxδ . Therefore, the main control action remains the

system returns to normal.
As demonstrated above, LQR is often appropriate for
stabilization. However, LQR produces a residual error at
the steady state due to gravity. This error can be eliminated
using the PID control law (LQR with supervisory controller).
For instance, the integral action has to be increased at the
beginning of the transient response to shorten the rise time,
and decreased when the system error is negative to reduce
the overshoot.
Figure 10 plots the time response for cart position and
seesaw angle with unexpected load disturbance, respectively.
Figure 10(a) demonstrates that a pure LQR had a high
transient tracking performance for cart position in the
experiment. If the tracking controller can perform successful
control, then the supervisory controller just observes and does
not take any action. Furthermore, the tracking performance
deteriorated when loading disturbance was applied to the
seesaw angle under pure LQR control [Fig. 10(b)]. It
also demonstrates that the seesaw angle θ performance

improved significantly when the supervisory controller was
applied. The steady-state error was reduced considerably.
As before, the performance of the proposed controller
was not significantly affected by the modification of
system parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
controller in minimizing steady-state error in the time
domain even when unexpected load disturbance occurs.
The proposed LQR with supervisory control seems to
have the required performance and robustness for such a
case. Moreover, the proposed control methodology is a
powerful and efficient way to cope with such a cart-seesaw
system.
Figure 11 presents the performance for the LQR and LQR
with supervisory under set point-to-point trajectory. The
tracking performance for setting the point-to-point trajectory
while applying the supervisory controller was found to be
good. The proposed control modification scheme produced
a substantial improvement in performance of the tracking
tasks.

The ball and beam system has both nonlinear and unstable characteristics. Hence, several approaches, such as input–
output feedback linearization [8], robust nonlinear control [9,10] and fuzzy logic control [11–13], have been developed to
control the ball and beam system. However, these schemes are based on the same conventional ball-on-beam plant, in
which the ball rolls along the beam in response to beam angle changes. Notably, this system lacks a mechanism for other
control purposes. Furthermore, a literature review indicates that no researcher has attempted to control a ball and beam
mechanism using a pneumatic cylinder for actuation. Thus, this work proposes a novel ball-and-beam-like mechanism
called the cart–seesaw system [14]. The seesaw can only rotate on a vertical plane with one degree of freedom (dof), and
the cart slides along the seesaw in response to a force applied by a pneumatic device. Notably, this system has only one
sliding cart.
Moreover, many studies [15–20] have elucidated the dynamic responses of a ﬂexible beam with a moving cart. Such
systems occur when high-speed trains travel on railroad tracks and bridges, with overhead cranes, during high-speed
precision machining and when computer disk drives are used for data storage [21]. When used in a system with ﬂexible
structures, piezoelectric materials are bonded to the body structure using a strong adhesive. A structure with an integrated
distributed piezoelectric sensor and actuator was described in [22–26]. These studies demonstrated that the distributed
piezoelectric sensing layer monitors structural oscillation via the converse piezoelectric effect. However, all these studies
limited their focus to vibration control of a laminated beam, and no study has developed a control methodology for an
elastic beam ﬁxed onto a moving cart. This work applies a novel approach for a high-performance piezoelectric absorber in
the beam–cart system in [21]. In reality, vibration of an elastic beam is markedly affected by the moving cart, particularly
during reciprocal cart motion. However, this work only deals with the beam–cart system; that is, it does not address an
elastic beam subjected to a seesaw mechanism.
Hence, this work extends the results of the author’s previous work [14]. The motion and control of a Bernoulli–Euler
beam subjected to the modiﬁed cart/seesaw system are analyzed ﬁrst. Moreover, this work presents a novel active–passive
vibration absorber with gray relational analysis for tuning PID control parameters of an active controller. The experimental
apparatus is used to assess the efﬁciency of the proposed scheme. This work will serve as a reference for achievable control
behavior for an underactuated mechanism, and extends existing curriculum to the control of underactuated robots.
Moreover, the proposed software/hardware platform can also be proﬁtable for the standardization of laboratory
equipment, as well as for the development of entertainment tools.

Fig. 1 schematically depicts a beam–cart–seesaw system. Fig. 2 shows this beam–cart–seesaw system and some
important devices in such a system. The system consists of two mobile carts coupled via rack-and-pinion mechanics to two
parallel tracks mounted on pneumatic rodless cylinders. The cylinder was double-acting. One cart carries an elastic beam,

where l0 is the location of the piezo-actuator. The details of symbolic terms in Eq. (6) are provided in Appendix 1.
The inertial matrix of the overall system,M(c)AR(4+n) (4+n), in Eq. (7) is symmetrical and positive-deﬁnite. Therefore,
inertial matrix M(c), which is uniformly bounded from above and below, satisﬁes
mI4þnrMðcÞrmI4þn, 8c 2 R4þn (8)
where m and m are positive constants, and In+pAR
(4+n) (4+n) is the identity matrix. The resulting equations above
demonstrate that the element of the dynamic equation matrix is very complex and highly nonlinear. Because manual
symbolic expansion for such system is tedious, time consuming, and prone to errors, an automated derivation process is
highly desirable. Therefore, a symbolic program written in MATLAB to generate the dynamic equations for such system is
used in this research.
4. Controller design
The control objective attempts to determine input control force u1, such that the deﬂection of the beam w damps out as
efﬁciently as possible while the positions of the sliding carts follow the desired tracking. This section introduces a two-
level control scheme. The pneumatic proportional valves drive the carts to the desired position dominated by the position
tracking controller. Moreover, a vibration absorber design for a structure ultimately attempts to limit structural vibrations to
the desired level by appropriately driving the piezo-actuator. However, due to space limitations, this work only focuses on
the vibration suppression controller.
The controller for suppressing vibratory motion can be constructed using a piezo-material. The sensors are utilized to
obtain information of modal state variables, which are further processed as modal control forces. The actual control inputs
are synthesized and applied to the proposed system through the piezoelectric actuators.
Although controlling ﬂexible structures is a complex task, one can design and employ high-performance controllers that
suppress structural vibrations, thereby ensuring the closed-loop stability of the controlled system. Particularly, when
actuators and sensors are collocated and compatible (e.g., collocated piezoelectric transducers), a very efﬁcient control
design approach can be generated. Therefore, the control design techniques introduced in this study assume a collocated
structure.
The voltage across the faces of a distributed piezoelectric sensor subjected to strain due to beam is derived by

where Q0 is the charge coefﬁcient, which depends on the piezoelectric constant and geometric parameters, C is the sensor
capacitance, (r,t) is the beam curvature, Z(r) is the spatial distribution of the sensor segment, and l1 and l2 are the sensor
boundary coordinates. Moreover, i(r) is the slope of the mode shape function evaluated at x, and qi(t) is the modal
coordinate corresponding to the ith mode [21,25,26].
Since the vibration suppression controller is independent of cart/seesaw positioning control, the individual PID
controller is easy to design for each collocated actuator–sensor pair. However, the principal challenge in designing an
acceptable PID controller is tuning PID controller parameters to achieve the desired performance. The approach for
selecting parameters based on experimental results is typically time-consuming. However, manual tuning is not frequently
applied in practice, because it is both laborious and time-consuming, particularly for processes with large time constants.
Manual tuning also requires an instrument/control engineer and operator to pay close attention to the process, because the
process must be operated near instability to measure ultimate gain and period [27]. Thus, an efﬁcient method for selecting
the PID control gains of a vibration absorber is required.
This remaining subsection introduces the gray relational approach for analyzing system output (vibrational
displacement) sensitivity to small perturbations in PID controller parameters. Gray relational analysis is employed to

(NIs) Data Acquisition (DAQ) boards (the PCI-MIO-16E-4 and PCI-6174) and a host personal computer. The real-time
software interface of the controller board permits rapid control prototyping using LabVIEW, thereby enabling a quick
implementation of the proposed control approach using the real-time block model applied in LabVIEW. Furthermore,
a ﬂexible cantilever aluminum-beam-type structure with piezoelectric patches was symmetrically bonded on both sides to
permit structural bending. The cantilever beam was clamped at one end and free at the other end. Strip-bender-type
401010 (made by American Piezo Ceramics, Inc.) piezoelectric patches were attached to the beam surfaces and acted as
actuators (where input signals are applied) and a sensor (where output signals are recorded). The voltage from the
piezoelectric sensor was utilized to evaluate the beam vibration level. Hence, the control work attempts to suppress
vibrations of this beam–cart–seesaw system using a PID vibration suppression control structure. The feedback voltage
applied across the piezoelectric actuator can be determined using the control algorithm in Section 4.
Gray relational analysis is performed to determine the sensitivity of PID vibration controller parameters and achieve
the desired damping performance. Calculation of the GRG follows the steps outlined in Section 4. Table 1 presents the
computational results yielded by Eqs. (10)–(15) for vibration suppression of an elastic beam. Table 1 presents the
normalized rms tracking error, eb, for various kbp, kbi, and kbd control gains. Table 1 also shows the GRC g and its relational
grade, P. The GRG P is 0.94082 for kbp, 0.91509 for kbd, and 0.90899 for kbi. Hence, the sensitivities of parameter
perturbations are obtained easily. Furthermore, the PID vibration controller is more sensitive for tuning kbp than for tuning
kbd and kbi (Table 1). The ranked importance of control gains is kbp4kbd4kbi. The most important parameter typically
dominates during base control; the next most important parameters are used to modify ﬁne motion. Hence, control
parameters with the highest priorities should be modiﬁed ﬁrst. Based on the GRG between tracking error and PID control
gains, all control gains can be ranked according to their GRGs—this procedure is called gray relational ranking.
Consequently, an operator can make an appropriate decision based on the gray ranking and the control goal can be
achieved. Fig. 6 shows the modiﬁcation process.
