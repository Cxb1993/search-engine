Abstract: 
We propose a method for preparing novel nanostructured materials using self-assembled 
templates formed by organogels. Dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) is a sugar derivative that is 
capable of self-assembling into a 3-D nanofibrillar network at relatively low concentrations in 
some organic solvents and polymer melts. In this work, we induced the formation of such 
nanofibrils in organic monomers such as styrene. Subsequently, we synthesized the styrene using 
general thermal-initiated polymerization. The resulting materials would be a transparent solid or 
film containing nanofibrils from DBS organogels. The final self-assembled microstructure was 
examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM). This study revealed that self-assembled entities 
could indeed be preserved during polymerization, and the resulting nanofibrils ranged from 10 
nm to 100 nm in diameter.

commercial applications. The other significant advantage of thermal-initiated polymerization is 
that it is not limited by the thickness of the materials. However, the penetration through the 
thickness of materials is low for the photopolymerization, restricting use to surface-type 
applications.  
Experimental: 
Materials. DBS (1,3:2,4-dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol) was purchased from Milliken Chemicals. 
Styrene and BPO (Benzoyl Peroxide) were of reagent grade and were obtained from Aldrich and 
Fluka, respectively. 
Polymerization. The organogel samples were prepared by dissolving different amounts of DBS 
in styrene at 160°C on a hot plate under constant agitation (200 rpm). After the DBS all dissolved 
in styrene, BPO (1.0 wt%), as an initiator, was added to the samples. At this high temperature, the 
BPO easily dissolved in styrene in a few seconds; then the samples were removed from the hot 
plate and cooled to room temperature very quickly to suppress the polymerization so that gelled 
samples could be obtained. The final polystyrene samples were synthesized using 
thermal-initiated polymerization at 80°C for 1 day.  
Rheological measurements.  The rheological properties of DBS/styrene organogel samples 
were measured using an oscillatory viscometer (Rheolab MC 100, Paar-Physica, Stuttgart, 
Germany)。The frequency (ω) spectra of the elastic and viscous moduli (G' and G") were 
collected over 0.01 to 100 rad/s at 25°C.   
Monomer conversion.  The polymerized samples were immersed in methanol for at least 2 
days until there was no change in sample weights. Methanol was used to remove the monomers, 
small molecules, and oligomers. Subsequently, the samples were taken out of the beaker and 
extensively washed with de-ionized water. Finally, the samples were dried in vacuo. The weight 
of the dried samples (Mf) was measured. Mo signifies the weight of samples before immersion. 
The conversion (P) was determined gravimetrically. The monomer conversion was calculated 
using the following equation:

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The samples analyzed by AFM were prepared by dissolving 
different amount of DBS in styrene at 160°C on a hot plate. After the DBS completely dissolved 
in styrene, 1.0 wt% BPO was added to the samples as an initiator. The samples were then quickly 
removed from the hot plate, and deposited on silicon wafers by spin coating at 1700 rpm for 20 
seconds at room temperature. The final polymer samples on silicon wafers were polymerized at 
80°C for 1 day. 
The polymer samples were imaged in ambient conditions with a Digital Instruments D3100 
SPM system operating in tapping mode using OTESP tips (Olympus Tapping Mode Etched 
Silicon Probe) from Veeco Instruments. The tips were used at resonance frequencies of 300 kHz. 
Silicon cantilevers had a spring constant of 42 N/m. The scan rate was 1.0 Hz.

diameter. A higher DBS concentration causes an increased average diameter of nanofibrils. This 
may represent increased aggregates of the nanofibrils or bundles of primary nanofibrils. It also 
demonstrates that we could change the size of nanofibrils by tuning the template composition. 
Conclusion: 
We have demonstrated an interesting method of using organogels to generate transparent 
polymer solids simply by polymerizing the liquid monomer. Thermal-initiated polymerization 
was employed in this study because it required no special UV-exposure apparatus. Samples could 
easily be prepared in standard glass vials, heated, and removed. Moreover, this thermal-initiated 
polymerization resulted in highly transparent polymer solids retaining the organgogels 
nano-structures. AFM results show that the DBS network consists of nanofibrils measuring 10 
nm to 100 nm in diameter. This is the first observation of DBS organogels as templates in a 
polymer system.
