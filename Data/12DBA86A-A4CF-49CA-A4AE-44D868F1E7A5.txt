measurement, making use of a high-precision servo motor, namely the 
Direct-Drive motor (D.D. motor), in the axial loading system is presented in this 
study, which not only provides the needed axial displacement but also can be used 
to measure the axial strain. A modified triaxial testing system with the mentioned 
D.D. motor and local strain measurements is thus developed to perform the test. 
Then, the stress-strain behaviors of natural Taipei silty clay obtained by two 
different strain measurements were compared to investigate the feasibility of 
measuring the strain by means of the D.D. motor. 
In addition to the strain measurement used in triaxial tests, testing procedures 
for sampled soil have been recognized as important factors in determining soil 
properties. As a result, work on developing and comparing techniques for 
reproducing the in-situ state of soil have been undertaken (e.g., Bjerrum 1973; 
Ladd and Foott 1974; Ladd and De Groot 2003; Santagata and Germaine 2005). 
Most studies have focused on improving the reconsolidation stage. However, as 
observed by Cho et al. (2007), the effect of swelling during saturation of clay 
specimens causes changes in soil structure and affectes stress-strain responses at a 
strain of less than 0.01%. Saturation is thus considered as important as the 
reconsolidation stage in a triaxial test. 
To maintain the good quality of the soil sample during the saturation stage, 
an apparatus capable of controlling the suction in soil specimens and connecting 
to the triaxial testing system should be developed. Studies related to setting up a 
suction control system have been done by many researchers (e.g., Cunningham et 
al. 2003, Jotisankasa et al. 2007). However, these suction control systems focused 
on studies related to unsaturated soil. The application of existing suction control 
systems to saturated soil tests has been limited because suction force directly 
applied to saturated soil will result in the decrease of degree of saturation, which 
is undesirable in testing on a saturated soil sample. 
Thus, this study also describes the improvement of saturation in triaxial tests

where i is the direction of wave propagation and j is the direction of wave 
polarization.   is the bulk density and sV  is the measured shear wave velocity. 
Finally, this study focused on the development of anisotropic shear modulus 
during K0 consolidation and undrained shearing. A series of CK0UAC triaxial tests 
were conducted on reconstituted Taipei silty clay. The variation of anisotropy of 
shear moduli under different consolidation stress, void ratio, and shear strain was 
investigated by performing bender element tests. The empirical equations for 
estimating the shear moduli and anisotropic ratio for shear moduli in the function 
of stress state, void ratio, and OCR were established.

1. Testing Apparatus  
1.1. Axial Loading System 
A triaxial testing system, capable of performing tests at small strain and 
equipped for local measurements, is developed in this study. The testing system, 
consisting of an axial loading system, a pressure controller, and a data acquisition 
system, is an automated, programmable, and feedback-controlled system. A 
high-accuracy, direct-drive servo motor (D.D. motor) was used to provide the 
axial displacement in triaxial tests. As shown in Fig. 1, the D.D. motor (SN: NSK 
M-YSB 2020KN001) was fixed on the loading frame, and the transmission was an 
extremely precise ball screw (SN: NSK DFT 2805-5) tightened on the motor 
directly, i.e. no indirect transmissions such as gears or belts were used in the axial 
loading system.  
The major advantages of a driving system with a D.D. motor are the high 
rigidity and the absence of transmission gears. Hence, the backlash in the axial 
loading system should be zero. The resolution of the motor is 819200 steps per 
revolution, and every round of rotation creates 5 mm of linear motion. Thus, the 
minimum single axial displacement is  mm (=  mm), which 
makes it ideal for displacement-controlled tests. The maximum error due to the 
D.D. motor is 150 seconds in every round of rotation, i.e. the 150 seconds error 
will be generated in each motor rotation, i.e. 360 degrees 
(360 degree 60min degree 60sec min 129200    seconds). Thus, the possible 
largest error in the axial displacement is 0.0116% ( 150 1292000 ), or 0.58 m  
10 
 
tilting errors induced by the set-up of a specimen were greatly reduced and should 
not affect the accuracy of the stress-strain measurement in the test. 
2. Test Plan and Materials 
2.1. Test Materials 
Small-strain triaxial tests were conducted on 50 mm diameter specimens of 
low plasticity Taipei silty clay taken from fixed-piston thin-tube samples and from 
reconstituted samples. The in-situ soil samples were retrieved from a site near a 
well-documented excavation case in Taipei, named TNEC. Considerable 
investigations of soil characteristics at the TNEC site have been done by 
laboratory tests on tube samples and field tests, e.g., small-strain tests and in-situ 
cross-hole tests (Ou et al. 1998; Kung 2007). The reconstituted sample was made 
of low plasticity Taipei silty clay as well. The clay was dried in the oven for 24 
hours and then crushed to a powder, passing through a 425-micron sieve. The 
reconstituted samples were created by mixing the soil powder with a water content 
of 93%, twice the liquid limit, to form slurry. The slurry was then subjected to a 
vertical consolidation stress of 150 kPa, by several steps in a chamber. 
2.2. Test Plan 
The testing plan presented here is separated into two series, i.e. test series A 
and test series B. The purpose of test series A was to ensure that strains measured 
by the D.D. motor and the Hall sensor were close to each other. For test series B, 
two strain measurements were used to investigate the stress-strain behavior of 
natural clay. These two test series are introduced in detail in the following. 
Test series A, i.e. CIU_AC test, was to investigate the difference in axial 
strains measured by the D.D motor and the Hall sensor at different testing 
conditions, i.e. the effective confining pressure and shearing rate. In order to 
exclude the other influencing factors, such as spatial variation of in-situ soil, the 
12 
 
second tests were not always on the same side of the solid line. The results show 
that the loading frame deformation, the bedding error or the tilting error has little 
influence on the strain measurement with the arrangement of tests presented 
herein.  
Discrepancies between the measured data and the solid line shown in Fig. 6 
can be explained as resulting from the measuring error of the Hall Effect local 
sensor. The reason for treating the discrepancy in Fig. 6 as noise affecting the Hall 
sensor was that bedding and tilting errors were proved to have little influence on 
the strain measuring.  Moreover, the Hall sensor accurate to about 0.8% of full 
range output (6mm here), i.e. 48 m  (0.8% 6mm), which was significantly 
larger than the maximum error in the D.D. motor measurements, which was 
0.58 m , as mentioned previously. 
3.2. Strain ratio of two strain measurements 
Fig. 7 shows the ratio of strain measured by the Hall sensor to that measured 
by the D. D. motor in the strain range of 10
-3
% to 1%. The mean value of strain 
ratio obtained in test series A was 0.979, and the coefficient of variation was equal 
to 0.042. As observed in Fig. 7, most strain ratios ( ) were located 
within 0.9 to 1.1, i.e. the maximum difference between two different strain 
measurements was only 10%. For the small strain range (strain less than 0.01%), 
the strain ratios were in the range of 0.98 to 1.04, which was more reliable. The 
variation of strain ratio may result from measuring noise affecting the Hall sensor, 
as discussed above. However, the strain ratio seems to be more scattered in 
larger-strain ranges than in the small-strain range. The result can be explained by 
the fact that the loading frame was subjected to higher loading when the axial 
strain increased, and this resulted in such discrepancy. For the test at the effective 
confining stress of 196 kPa and shearing rate of 5%, which was the heaviest 
loading condition for the loading frame, the strain ratio shown in Fig.7 was not 
affected significantly by the deformation of loading frame and was still close to 
14 
 
largest loading when the soil sample reaches the failure state, which may 
overestimate the strain measured externally. Results shown in Fig. 8 to Fig. 10 
illustrate that the stiffness measured by two strain measurements were still close to 
each other, even though the strain was approaching the failure condition. Table 3 
lists the failure strain measured by the D.D. motor and the Hall sensor, and the 
ratio of strain measured by the D.D. motor to that by the hall sensor at the failure 
state. Most of the failure strains measured by two strain measurements were 
within the range of 3% to 5%. Also, the strain ratios measured on samples from 
different depths are plotted in Fig. 11 where the mean value of strain ratios is 
0.975 and the coefficient of variation is equal to 0.066. All the results mentioned 
above proved that the strain measurements made by use of a D.D. motor were still 
reliable even near the failure condition of the soil samples. 
4. Summary 
Two series of small-strain triaxial tests, i.e. CIU_AC and CK0U_AC, were 
carried out on reconstituted and tube samples of Taipei silty clay, respectively. 
Strains and stiffness measured by the D.D. motor and by the Hall Effect local 
strain sensor were compared to examine the feasibility of measuring the strain by 
the D.D. motor in triaxial tests. Results from CIU_AC tests on reconstituted 
samples show that the ratios of strain measured by two different methods were in 
the range of 0.9 to 1.1, and were located between 0.98 and 1.04 at the small-strain 
range, which implies that strain measurements made by the D.D. motor are 
suitable for the triaxial test. In addition, results of CIU_AC tests also show that 
either different effective confining pressures or different shearing rates have little 
influence on the strains measured by the two methods.  
Results from CK0U_AC tests on tube samples indicate that the ratios of 
stiffness from the D.D. motor to those by the Hall sensor ranged between 0.97 and 
1.09. The stiffness measured by the D.D. motor was much steadier than that 
measured by the Hall sensor at strain less than 10
-3
%, which brought out the linear

pressure without causing any change in the effective stress, i.e., the effective stress 
is still equal to the residual effective stress. The residual effective stress, namely 
the s   in Fig. 2, is the effective stress remaining in the soil specimen after 
sampling, storage, and handling (Ladd and DeGroot 2003 ; Cho et al. 2007). After 
that, the specimen is recompressed to in-situ stress, as indicated by point E in Fig. 
1, inducing the void ratio change 2e . Since the void ratio change ( 2e ) in the 
path BE is significantly smaller than that due to the path CD ( 1e ), this shows that 
the quality of the soil sample is not degraded in the process of saturation. 
To maintain the good quality of the soil sample during the saturation stage, 
an apparatus capable of controlling the suction in soil specimens and connecting 
to the triaxial testing system should be developed. Studies related to setting up a 
suction control system have been done by many researchers (e.g., Cunningham et 
al. 2003, Jotisankasa et al. 2007). However, these suction control systems focused 
on studies related to unsaturated soil. The application of existing suction control 
systems to saturated soil tests has been limited because suction force directly 
applied to saturated soil will result in the decrease of degree of saturation, which 
is undesirable in testing on a saturated soil sample.  
This paper describes the improvement of saturation in triaxial tests 
considering soil suction due to sampling. An apparatus capable of suction control 
in triaxial tests has been developed to improve the saturation condition. Triaxial 
tests with and without suction control were conducted on reconstituted Taipei silty 
clays. The effects of saturation with suction control are verified in terms of (1) the 
void ratio change ( 0e e ) after recompression (2) the shear modulus obtained 
from bender element tests during K0 consolidation, and (3) the stress-strain 
characteristics at small strains during undrained shearing. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Soils

The negative water pressure was measured by the pressure sensors, i.e., suc1 
and suc2 in Fig. 3, which ranged from -1 to 0 bars. The calibration of negative 
pressure sensors is shown in Fig. 4 as well and denoted by circles. Fig. 5 shows 
the example of suction control on a soil sample in a triaxial test, where the initial 
suction is 40 kPa and decreases to 0 kPa in 20 steps. Additional pressure 
measurements made by mid-plane pore pressure probe (M4P in Fig. 5) and 
external Druck pressure transducer (Druck in Fig. 5) were used in addition to suc1 
and suc2. The rate of suction adjustment was 2 kPa/step in this test, and each step 
ended with the pressure reading near the step goal. 
2.3 Determination of residual effective stress 
The evaluation of residual effective stress can be done by measuring the 
suction in the soil sample. Measuring suction by undrained isotropic loading in a 
triaxial cell is relatively simple and convenient for the conventional triaxial testing 
system as discussed by Navaneethan et al. (2005). However, this technique is only 
reliable when the B value is very close to 1.0 (B is the Skempton’s pore water 
pressure parameter). For a soil sample before full saturation, the B value may be 
much lower than 1.0 because of the existence of air bubbles in the specimen or 
drainage lines. The value of suction in the soil specimen is thus expected to be 
overestimated significantly. The overestimated suction gives incorrect information 
about the residual effective stress and will result in extra isotropic consolidation 
on the specimen if the soil specimen is saturated at this residual effective stress. 
Therefore, a direct method for measuring suction by using pressure sensors of 
range from -1 to 0 bar and porous ceramic filters, was adopted in this study. The 
limit on the suction in this study is 100 kPa due to the methods and instruments 
used. For measuring soil suction higher than 100 kPa, other methods are available, 
such as the filter paper method and high capacity tensiometers.  
Performance of this measuring method will be seriously affected if the filter 
is not fully saturated. The initial saturation procedure for ceramic filter is similar 
36 
 
or 0.58 m  ( 0.0116% 5mm ) in every round of rotation of the D.D. motor. 
Fig. 6(b) shows the pressure controller used in controlling the cell pressure 
and back pressure. The pressure controller is digital and connected to the testing 
system, and the resolutions for controlling and reading are 1 kPa and 0.015 kPa, 
respectively. This testing system uses internal measurements, including two axial 
and one radial local Hall effect transducers (Clayton et al. 1989), a submersible 
load cell (±2 kN, Sensotec), two mid-plane pore pressure probes (7 bar, GDS 
Instrument), and bender elements (GDS Instrument). This small strain 
measurement system is capable of resolving 0.003 kPa of pore pressure, 0.001% 
of axial strain, and 0.005 kPa of axial stress. The Hall effect local strain sensors, 
which have a linear range of ±3 mm around the electrical zero, were calibrated by 
a calibration rig equipped with a digital micrometer head (resolution=1 m ).  
A set of bender elements was embedded in the top cap and bottom pedestal. 
The shape of the received signal and uncertainties in determining the travel time 
of the shear wave in bender element tests were affected by near-field effects 
(Viggiani and Atkinson 1995; Jovicic et al. 1996; Brignoli et al. 1996). In order to 
understand the influence of different driven frequencies on the determination of 
the travel time of shear waves, bender element tests with frequencies varying from 
3 kHz to 15 kHz were performed on the reconstituted Taipei silty clay at constant 
effective vertical stress after K0 consolidation. The methods for determining the 
travel time were (1) The resonance method (2) The visual inspection method, and 
(3) The cross-correlation method (Viggiani and Atkinson 1995; Jovicic et al. 1996; 
Arulnathan et al. 1998; Lee and Santamarina 2005). The test results show that a 
consistent travel time or velocity can be obtained once the input frequency is 
higher than the resonance frequency. The disturbance of near field effect when 
determining the travel time is eliminated by choosing a frequency higher than the 
resonance frequency. Therefore a driven frequency of 10 kHz is chosen for bender 
element tests in this study.

control. The confining pressure was kept unchanged during the suction 
measurement stage, and the effective stress in the specimen should be equal to the 
measured suction. After the measured suction reached equilibrium, i.e., a suction 
of 18.5 kPa in Fig. 7, then the suction control stage started. The suction control 
process was separated into 5 steps here, as shown in Fig. 7, and the adjusting 
suction was about 4 kPa in every single step. The cell pressure was increased 
simultaneously for the purpose of keeping the effective stress unchanged in each 
step. The effective stress in the specimen shown in Fig. 7 was always equal to the 
initial suction (18.5 kPa) through the whole suction control process. 
For those specimens without suction control, the mean effective stresses 
during saturation ( sat  ) were set equal to 10, 5 and 2 kPa, respectively, all 
commonly used in the conventional saturation procedure. Each specimen was 
recompressed under the K0 condition to an effective vertical stress of 200 kPa or 
300kPa, with full saturation (B value > 98%). Thereafter, the specimens were 
subjected to the axial compression under the undrained condition with a rate of 0.2 
%/hr. 
Bender element tests were conducted in the consolidation stage using a 
single-pulse sinusoidal input wave with the driven frequency determined by 
previous tests. The trigger points of bender element tests were at the end of every 
two consolidation steps. The elastic shear wave velocity, sV , was calculated using 
the wave travel time determined by the visual inspection method, very close to 
that determined by the cross-correlation method with the chosen frequency of 10 
kHz, and the tip-to-tip distance between transmitting and receiving bender 
elements. The shear modulus, BEG  can be calculated as 
2

where  = bulk mass density of the specimen when sV  was measured.

1e (=0.063) for the test with suction control, i.e., 18.5sat kPa   , was smaller 
than 2e (=0.081) for the test without suction control, i.e., 5sat kPa   . The 
recompression processes for both specimens saturated with and without suction 
control were identical. However, they resulted in different void ratio changes 
during recompression. It may be concluded that the quality of a specimen can be 
improved by the proposed suction control system. 
The variation of vhG  values measured by bender elements during 
recompression is shown in Fig. 11. The specimen saturated with suction control 
exhibited higher values of vhG  than other specimens. At the effective vertical 
stress equal to 147 kPa, the vhG  of the specimen saturated with suction control 
( 18.5sat kPa   ) is 14% higher than that saturated without suction control 
( 5sat kPa   ). 
3.2 Stress-strain behaviors during undrained shearing 
After K0 consolidation, all the specimens were subjected to undrained axial 
compression. Fig. 12 illustrates the differences in the initial part of the 
stress-strain responses by plotting the curves of Young’s modulus normalized to 
the undrained shear strength. Although all degradation curves of stiffness are 
similar, the stiffness of the specimen saturated at 2sat kPa    at small strain, i.e., 
strain equals 310 % , is about 20% lower than that saturated with suction control. 
Results from the comparison of the stiffness at small strain indicate that the 
conventional saturation method reduces the initial stiffness of soils, and the 
saturation method with suction control is helpful for keeping sample quality.  
The undrained failure characteristics for reconstituted clay for different sat   
are summarized as listed in Table 2. Unlike the stress-strain behavior at small 
strain level, all the tests exhibite the same value of normalized undrained shear 
strength, i.e., 0.3u vcS    . This may imply that the undrained failure 
characteristics were little affected by saturation procedure. 
42 
 
For further comparison, the shear moduli measured by the in-situ cross-hole 
method, which represents the undisturbed quality and no void ratio change, and 
those of the reconstituted samples with/without suction control measured by 
bender elements are plotted against the void ratio change as shown in Fig. 13. It is 
clearly shown that the shear modulus of the specimen saturated with suction 
control is much closer to that of the in-situ state than those of specimens saturated 
conventionally. This figure also shows that the void ratio change during 
recompression can be used to evaluate the reduction ratio of shear moduli for 
specimens with different degrees of disturbance. The reduction ratio of shear 
moduli, R, is obtained by the regression of the data points in Fig. 13 and listed as 
below:

(4) 
where GLab is the shear moduli measured on sampled soils by bender element tests, 
GIn-situ is the shear moduli measured by field tests, and 0e e  is the void ratio 
change during recompression. 
For example, as calculated by Eq. (4), the shear modulus measured in the 
laboratory test is only 66% of that measured in the in-situ state if the void ratio 
change by recompression is equal to 0.08. In other words, once the shear moduli 
measured in laboratory tests and the void ratio changes were known, the in-situ 
shear moduli could be determined by Eq. (4). 
The relationship, considering the effect of the anisotropic stress state on the 
shear moduli Gvh, was proposed by Hardin and Blandford (1989) and can be 
expressed as:

reasonable to assume that such discrepancies are due to sample disturbance during 
the sampling process, which caused the swelling of soil and resulted in higher 
void ratio changes by recompression. Eq. (4), for the evaluation of the reduction 
of stiffness due to void ratio change, was therefore adopted to modify the shear 
modulus estimated through sampled soils. The shear moduli measured on 
specimens sampled from the TNEC site using bender elements are modified by Eq. 
(4) and are shown in Fig. 14. The result shows that the shear moduli measured on 
sampled soils with the modification of Eq. (4) match those measured by 
cross-hole tests quite well. 
On the other hand, by substituting GLab into Eq. (4) with the Gvh in Eq. (6), 
Eq. (4) can be rewritten to estimate the in-situ shear modulus, GIn-situ, as follows:

 (7) 
The normalized shear moduli calculated by Eq. (7) and denoted by triangles in Fig. 
14 are based on the soil properties obtained from sampled soils at the TNEC site. 
The result shows that the shear moduli estimated by Eq. (7) are very close to the 
measurements from cross-hole tests. 
The proposed method of specimen saturation with the suction control system 
is efficient in reducing the effect of swelling during saturation and void ratio 
change during recompression. The concept of the proposed method is similar to an 
alternative saturation method used in oedometer tests, i.e., maintaining zero 
volume change during the initial phase of saturation. This deformation-controlled 
system may be applicable on specimens with suction over 100 kPa. However, the 
application of zero-volume change saturation in triaxial tests is difficult to achieve 
because the deformation of specimens in triaxial tests is two-dimensional while it 
is only one-dimensional in oedometer tests. Furthermore, the current measurement 
46 
 
equations are derived to estimate the in-situ shear modulus. The in-situ shear 
modulus can be estimated using the proposed equations, with the measured shear 
modulus of sampled soils.  
As seen in this study, with the measured suction pressure of 18.5 kPa, the 
Young’s modulus at small strain or shear modulus obtained from tests using 
suction control is significantly larger than in those without suction control. 
Theoretically the suction pressure of the soil after sampling should increase with 
the increasing depth of the soil. It is thus expected that the stiffness of the soil at 
deeper levels measured with suction control should be even much greater than that 
without suction control.  
However, the limitation of the suction control system proposed here is 100 
kPa. The proposed system is not applicable for use on specimens with suction 
higher than 100 kPa.

Part 4: Anisotropic stiffness for Taipei silty clay

Taipei silty clay at constant axial effective stress through the K0 reconsolidation. The 
methods for determining the travel time are 1) The resonance method, 2) The visual 
inspection method, and 3) cross-correlation method (Viggiani and Atkinson 1995; 
Jovicic et al. 1996; Arulnathan et al. 1998; Lee and Santamarina 2005).  The test 
results showed that the consistent travel time or velocity can be obtained once the 
input frequency higher than the resonance frequency, i.e. the high ttL   value. The 
disturbance of near field effect on determining travel time is eliminated by choosing 
the frequency correspond to high ttL  . Therefore, a driven frequency of 12 kHz is 
chosen for bender element tests in this study. 
2. Testing material and program 
The clay with low plasticity sampled in Taipei was used to reconstitute the soil 
specimen. The clay was dried in oven for 24 hours and then crushed to soil powder 
passed through a 425-micron sieve. The reconstituted samples were created by mixing 
the soil powder with the water content of 93%, twice of the liquid limit, to form a 
slurry. The resultant slurry was then subjected to a vertical stress of 120 kPa within 
several steps in a chamber. The major properties of the reconstituted clay are listed in 
Table 1. Triaxial specimens were hand trimmed from the reconstituted samples with a 
size of 50mm × 100height mm .  
The testing plan presented here is trying to investigate the development of shear 
moduli during the K0 reconsolidation. Thus bender element tests were conducted 
during the reconsolidation stage using a single-pulse sinusoidal input wave with the 
driven frequency determined by previous test. The trigger point of bender element test 
is at the end of every two reconsolidation steps. The elastic shear wave velocity, sV , 
was calculated by using the wave travel time determined by the visual inspection 
method, which is very closed to what determined by cross-correlation method with 
the chosen frequency of 12 kHz, and the tip-to-tip distance between transmitting and 
receiving bender elements. The reconsolidation was ended when the axial effective

It is found that the ARG value is always higher than 1.0 irrespective of consolidation 
stress. The results shown in Fig. 5 can be explained in the following aspects: (1) for 
the specimen in the medium over-consolidation state (OCR>2), the ARG values are 
quite steady and in the range of 1.7 0.1  (2) for the specimen in the low 
over-consolidation state to normal-consolidation state (2>OCR≧1), the ARG values is 
growing significantly with an increase of K0 consolidation stress, and ended with a 
value of 2.1 when reconsolidation is completed. It seems that the anisotropy formed 
by 1-D pre-consolidation was increased in K0 reconsolidation.  
3.3. Empirical expression for Gij 
According to the relationship proposed by Hardin and Blandford (1989) to 
consider the effect of the anisotropic stress state on shear moduli, the following 
equations can be expressed for Gvh and Ghh:

where Gvh and Ghh: the shear moduli obtained by bender element test; Pa: reference 
pressure (101.3 kPa); ( )f e : void ratio function; v   and h  : effective stress in the 
vertical and horizontal directions, respectively; Avh and Ahh are dimensionless material 
constants; and m, m*, nv, nh and nh* are all empirical exponents. 
Based on the data of GBE measured in the reconsolidation stage and without 
considering the change of void ratio, i.e. ( ) 1f e  , the determination of coefficients 
and exponents, i.e. Avh, Ahh, m, m*, nv, nh and nh*, can be done. Thus, equation (3)

slightly increasing in the ARG value is observed during the undrained shearing. 
4. Cross anisotropic model 
For a soil to be truly cross-anisotropic, it should satisfy the following conditions: 
(Gasparre et al. 2007) 
1. It should have horizontal bedding plane. 
2. It should have experienced orthogonal K0 stress conditions. 
3. It should not have been disturbed by prior tectonic or other diectionally oriented 
actions. 
Reconstituted samples meet these requirements and behave as a cross-anisotropic 
elastic material at very small strains, and its effective stress-strain increment equation 
can be written as,

directions respectively; hh  and vh  are the undrained Poisson’s ratios for 
horizontal strains due to horizontal and vertical strain respectively, and hv  is the 
undrained Poisson’s ratio for vertical strains due to horizontal strain; vhG  and hvG  
are the shear moduli in the vertical plane; and hhG  is the shear modulus in the 
horizontal plane. The y-axis is taken as the vertical here. 
In addition to vhG = hvG , the following two constrains lead to only five

However, for the NC clay, the variation of void ratio should be taken into 
account by assuming different form of void ratio functions. 
3. The strain level affects the development of ARG value in the undrained shearing. 
The anisotropy of shear moduli increases slightly within the undrained 
compression.

This study improved the triaxial testing system with a precise servo motor, 
namely the D.D. motor. Two series of small-strain triaxial tests, i.e. CIU_AC and 
CK0U_AC, were carried out on reconstituted and tube samples of Taipei silty clay, 
respectively. Strains and stiffness measured by the D.D. motor and by the Hall Effect 
local strain sensor were compared to examine the feasibility of measuring the strain 
by the D.D. motor in triaxial tests. Results of triaxial tests show that the stiffness 
measured by the D.D. motor was much steadier than that measured by the Hall sensor 
at strain less than 10
-3
%, which brought out the linear stress-strain behavior of soils at 
such levels of strain. It is thus expected that an alternative strain measurement by the 
D.D. motor with the accessories developed for set-up of specimens could be used for 
strain measurement in triaxial tests, both for the small-strain range and the large-strain 
range. 
In addition to the improvement of test apparatus, the saturation method in triaxial 
tests were also improved. A new method for saturation with suction control in the 
triaxial testing system has been presented hereinr. Test results show that the 
conventional saturation method yields poor specimen quality. It may be concluded 
that the proposed method of saturation is useful in preventing (1) change in soil 
structure due to swelling during conventional saturation, (2) degradation of the 
specimen quality evaluated either by void ratio change or shear modulus. 
After improving the testing system and procedure, a series of undrained triaxial 
tests (CK0U) were conducted on samples of Taipei silty clay to investigate the 
development of anisotropic shear moduli under various stress conditions. The 
following conclusions can be drawn based on the tests results presented herein: 
1. The anisotropy of shear moduli is observed even at very low consolidation stress 
state. Values of anisotropic ratio in shear moduli (ARG in Eq. (2)) remain in a 
range of 1.7 0.1  for OCR higher than 2, and increase with an increase of K0 
consolidation stress for OCR lower than 2. The final ARG value is about 2.1 in 
the end of reconsolidation.
