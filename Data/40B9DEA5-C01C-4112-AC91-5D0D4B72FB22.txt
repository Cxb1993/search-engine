2.1 Preparation of carbons with KOH activation  
The UC in bottom ash was ground in this work, and that with a particle size 
ranging from 0.83 to 1.65 mm was screened and activated. The activation was done 
by dissolving KOH in water in a stainless steel beaker, to which the UC was added. 
The weight ratio of water, KOH, and UC was 2:2:1, 3:3:1, and 4:4:1, where the 
KOH/UC ratio was denoted as 2, 3, and 4, respectively. They were uniformly mixed, 
dried at 130
o
C, and then placed in a high temperature oven. Nitrogen gas was 
introduced into the oven, where was heated to 780
o
C and kept there for 1 h. The 
product was neutralized by HCl (600 cm
3
) having an equal equivalent to KOH 
solution until most of CO2 bubbles were disappeared, to which a large amount of 10% 
HCl solution was then added. It was placed in water bathed at 80
o
C for 1 h, after 
which washing was continued with distilled water until the water became neutral. The 
samples were named as UCK2, UCK3, and UCK4, respectively, in which the third 
character K denotes KOH activation and the last number represents the weight ratio of 
KOH/UC involved during activation. 
2.2 Measurements of adsorbent properties  
 The total BET surface area of carbons (St) was measured from N2 adsorption 
isotherms at 77 K with a sorptiometer (Porous Materials, BET-202A). Prior to the 
measurement, samples were dried overnight in an oven at 130
o
C and then quickly 
placed in the sample tube. After that, the sample tube was heated to 230
o
C and 
evacuated for 4 h until the pressure was less than 1.33 x 10
-4
 mbar. The total pore 
volume (Vpore) was determined from the adsorption data based on manufacturer’s 
software (based on the Kelvin equation) and the pore size distribution was derived 
from the BJH theory [17]. The micropore volume (Vmicro) and external surface area 
(Sext) were calculated using the t-plot method [18,19]. The surface area due to 
micropores (Smicro) was obtained from the difference between St and Sext [20]. 
The elements of a sample (3 mg) were analyzed three times with an Elemental 
Analyzer (Model 611B, CH Instruments) after the sample was uniformly ground and 
oven-dried in an aluminum box at 130
o
C overnight. Adjustment analysis with a 
standard of sulfanilic acid was carried out in parallel with an ordinary sample. 
Moreover, the carbon sample was weighted and placed in a U-shape reactor, into 
which He gas was introduced at a flow rate of 30 cm
3
/min. Thermal conductive 
detector (TCD) was set at 150
o
C. Temperature rising program was started (from room 
temperature to 800
o
C within 50 min) after the instrument was stable. An information 
collecting machine was employed to read and take the necessary data. 
2.3 Procedures for adsorption experiments  
Analytical-reagent grade solutes including methylene blue (MB, MW = 284.3 
g/mol), acid blue 74 (AB74, 466.4 g/mol), and 4-chloropenol (4-CP, 128.6 g/mol) 
were obtained from Merck Co. The aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 
solute to required concentration without pH adjustment. The molecular structures of 
UCK2, UCK3, and UCK4, respectively. In a word, UCK3 has the highest yield and 
BET surface area, making it more feasible for practical applications. 
3.2. Chemical properties of activated carbons  
Fig. 4 shows TGA analysis of UC with and without KOH activation. It is found 
that the mass of ash (residue) is 9.5%. Bartonova et al. [24] have indicated that ash 
content of unburnt coal from bituminous coal and lignite combustion is 37.4 and 
52.7%, respectively. However, the ash contents from 2.9 to 11.9% have been also 
reported in various coals [27]. The structure of UC is strong and hard as shown in Fig. 
4. The slopes of TG curves are smaller. Until 650
o
C, the volatile and fixed carbons are 
completely gasified. However, UC2, UC3, and UC4, which were etched and 
expanded under KOH activation, have increased surface area and pore volume due to 
loose structure. Thus, their slopes of TG curves are larger. The temperature for 
complete gasification is lower at 550
o
C-600
o
C. The temperature of complete 
gasification of UC3 is the lowest, and hence UC3 has the largest surface area and pore 
volume. This result is in agreement with the data of BET measurements shown in 
Table 1. Also, owing to larger surface area and pore volume in UCK3, more ash is 
eliminated after being activated and washed with HCl, thereby providing positive 
effect on adsorption process. 
Table 2 lists the data of ash content (wt.%) that are obtained from TGA analysis 
shown in Fig. 4. The UC samples were dry and clean for elemental analysis. The 
element carbon in UC is 77.1%, comparable to the results in various coals, 
70.3-72.4% [27]. The content of element carbon in UCK3 increases to 83.6% because 
of the reduction in ash and element oxygen. 
3.3. Adsorption equilibrium: Langmuir equation  
Fig. 5 shows typical adsorption isotherms of MB, AB74, and 4-CP at 30
o
C on the 
carbons prepared at different weight ratios of KOH/UC. All curves rise steeply at low 
solute concentrations, and gradually reach to plateau at high concentrations. The 
correlation of isotherm data by a theoretical or empirical equation is essential for 
practical operation. The widely used two-parameter Langmuir equation is given as:

where Ce (mmol/L) and qe (mmol/g) are the liquid- and solid-phase solute 
concentrations at equilibrium, respectively, qmon is the amount of adsorption 
corresponding to monolayer coverage, and KL is the Langmuir constant. Based on Eq. 
(1), the linearized plot of (Ce/qe) against Ce will yield KL and qmon. 
Table 3 lists the parameters obtained, revealing that the Langmuir fit is good 
under the ranges studied (correlation coefficient, r
2
 > 0.9968). The essential 
characteristics of the Langmuir equation can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless 
separation factor, RL, defined as [28,29] 
nature, this equation predicts the behavior over the whole ranges of variables studied. 
This fact strongly supports its validity and suggests that the adsorption is 
rate-determined by chemical adsorption step [32,33]. The trends are the same in Figs. 
5 and 6: UCK3 > UCK4 > UCK2, indicating that UCK3 has higher adsorption 
capacity and adsorption rate. 
 
4  Conclusions 
Unburnt coal (UC) obtained from water-screened bottom ash in coal-fired power 
plants has been used to prepare activated carbons. The adsorption/desorption 
isotherms of N2, TGA, elemental analysis, and SEM photos revealed that physical and 
chemical properties of UC were similar to those of coal. These carbons exhibited a 
BET surface area ranging from 670 to 1520 m
2
/g, with a micropore volume ratio 
significantly changing from 0.37 to 0.80. According to the Langmuir parameters, the 
dimensionless separation factor RL for the adsorptions of methylene blue (MB), acid 
blue 74 (AB74), and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) on UCK3 was obtained to be 0.0027, 
0.0156, and 0.0157, respectively. Also, the adsorption rates were well followed by the 
Elovich equation. The 1/b values for the adsorption of MB, AB74, and 4-CP on UCK3 
were 0.225, 0.116, and 0.642 mmol/g, respectively. The present results proved that the 
carbons prepared from UC with KOH activation had the features of high surface area, 
high yield, and good adsorption performance.
