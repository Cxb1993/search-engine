One of the biological systems is the 
activated sludge aeration (ASA). Waste gas 
stream to be treated is introduced to an 
activated sludge aeration tank for wastewater 
treatment and water-soluble contaminants in 
the gas stream are dissolved in the activated 
sludge mixed liquor and biodegraded therein. 
Bielefedt and Stensel reported that based on a 
proposed mass-transfer model, the system with 
an aeration submerged liquid depth of > 2.0 m 
provides > 80% removal for biodegradable 
VOCs with dimensionless Henry’s law 
coefficients (H) of less than 0.35 [4, 5]  
VOCs with this Henry’s law coefficients 
include common solvents such as methanol, 
ethanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl 
ketone, acetone, methylene chloride, and 
BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and 
xylenes). [6-10] 
Another similar process is the “tower 
scrubbing-activated sludge oxidation (SAO)” 
one. This SAO process is generally consisted 
of a wet scrubber and a biological oxidation 
unit. The scrubber absorbs gas-borne 
pollutants into a biomass slurry such as an 
activated sludge liquor from a biological 
wastewater treatment, and the microorganisms 
in the oxidation unit oxidize the absorbed 
pollutants for regeneration of the slurry to 
retain its absorption ability. The biomass 
slurry is continuously circulated between the 
two units. Croonenberghs et al. (1994) studied 
the removal of ethanol in a 12.6 Nm3/min vent 
gas from a brewery wastewater treatment plant 
by a single-stage packing tower scrubbed with 
an activated sludge mixed liquor containing a 
suspended biomass solid concentration of 500 
mg/L. [9] 
This research attempted to propose a model 
for absorbing gas-borne VOCs into a 
down-flow activated sludge liquor in a 
sieve-plate column. Experiments were also 
conducted to verify the model based on the 
results of tests on the removal efficiencies of 
water-soluble isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 
relatively water-insoluble toluene and 
p-xylene in a pilot-scale system operated at a 
range of influent VOC concentrations, air 
application rates, and liquid/gas flow ratios 
(L/G). The three VOCs are frequently used in 
manufacturing paint, printing ink and synthetic 
chemicals. Results of this study allow a 
confirmation of the model and provide a 
design basis for treating gases contaminated 
with a range of volatile organic compounds. 
MODEL DEVELOPMENT 
A model is developed here to simulate the 
steady-state performance of a 
suspended-growth bioscrubber composed of 
an absorber and a separate oxidation reactor as 
shown in Figure 1. The biomass slurry is 
circulated between the absorber and the 
activated-sludge column for oxidation of the 
absorbed VOCs. The pollutant is both 
absorbed and partially oxidized in the 
absorption unit. 
 
Figure 1. Nomenclature for material balances 
and gas absorption in a N-stage sieve-plate 
column. 
The mechanistic model developed by 
Bielefeldt and Stensel describes the removal of 
VOCs from a contaminated gas stream 
sparged into a completely mixed activated 
sludge reactor as a function of the gas-liquid 
mass transfer and liquid VOC concentrations. 
[4, 5] By referring Fig. 1, considering the 
holdup aerated liquid in the stage n as a 
reactor, application of the model gives:

smaller than that of the influent gas to be 
treated, an increase of L/G could give a higher 
value of calculated y0, as a higher scrubbing 
liquid for an unit gas flow increases the VOC 
absorption capacity of the plate column.  For 
the same case, if the calculated y0 is higher, a 
smaller L/G should be used. 
By eqs. (7) and (8), parameters affecting 
column performance are KLaVOC(Z/U), H, 
xN+1, L/G, Z/U, and k.  For activated sludge 
mixed liquor with a higher MLSS, H in Eq. 
(10) should be replaced by H’ to take the 
effect of MLSS on the VOC solubility into 
consideration.  Also, k is also affected by the 
MLSS concentration of the absorbing liquor.  
According to the model, an increase of any 
one of KLaVOC (Z/U), L/G, Z/U, and k, or a 
decrease of H (or H’) or xN+1 increases the 
column absorption capacity for the gaseous 
VOC.  The influences of all the six 
parameters on the absorption capacity are 
simply understandable, however, a sensitivity 
analysis should worthily be made for finding 
the more importing factors which affect the 
VOC removal. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Experimental Apparatus 
The experimental setup consisted of a 
pilot-scale activated-sludge tank and a 
sieve-plate tower, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.  
The activated-sludge tank was constructed 
from a 40×40×300 cm (W×L×H) acrylic 
column and equipped with an air sparger with 
20 orifices of 2 mm diameter. The sieve-plate 
tower was constructed from a 25×25×162 cm 
(W×L×H) acrylic column with six 
custom-made sieve plates. Each plate has 382 
holes which are 3 mm in diameter arranged on 
a square pitch.  The holes give an open area 
of 3.82% of the whole plate area for gas flow.  
Two 25 mm-i.d. down-comer pipes were also 
equipped to allow for the downflow of the 
activated sludge liquor.  Ports were provided 
for gas and liquid sampling. 
Air drawn by a blower was bubbled through 
a liquid VOC (one of toluene, p-xylene and 
IPA) in a water-bathed Erlenmeyer flask to 
generate a VOC-rich air stream. VOC 
concentrations in the stream were varied by 
adjusting the temperature of the water bath or 
the air flow rate. The VOC-rich air was then 
mixed with a main air stream, which 
subsequently flowed into the bottom space of 
the sieve-plate tower. Air flow rates were 
measured by the rotameter.  Constant flow 
rates of activated sludge liquor for gas 
scrubbing was pumped into the top plate of the 
column.  An average aerated liquid depth (Z) 
of 5.0 or 8.5 cm could be kept in each sieve 
plate by adjusting the weir height of the 
down-comer pipe.  VOC-rich effluent liquor 
from the column bottom was circulated back 
to the tank for VOC oxidation.

Materials 
Reagent-grade toluene, p-xylene and IPA 
were used as target VOCs.  Activated sludge 
for seeding and acclimation was taken from 
the wastewater plant of Ta-Lin Refinery, 
Chinese Petroleum Co. (Kaohsiung County, 
Taiwan).  The sludge was adopted because it 
exhibited the potential to oxidize the target 
VOCs.  Table 1 lists the VOC influent rates 
and the solution composition for the activated 
sludge nutrition. The nutrient solution was 
daily prepared and fed continuously into the 
 6
and p-xylene those are 0.053-0.620 m3/m3. 
Each condition was kept at least three hours to 
let the system getting a quasi-steady state. 
After that time, a gas sample from each of the 
influent gas line and the overhead spaces of all 
the six plates was taken by an 1-mL gas-tight 
syringe for VOC analysis. In addition, liquid 
samples were taken from the inlet and outlet of 
the sieve-plate column and the 
activated-sludge tank to determine the VOC 
concentration. After liquid sampling, the 
mixed liquid was immediately filtered through 
a 4.7-cm dia. glass fiber paper to separate the 
sludge and the filtrate was put in screw-thread 
glass vials with Teflon-lined caps and stored at 
4
 o
C until analysis. 
Analytical 
VOC concentrations in the gas samples 
were measured by a gas chromatograph 
(Shimadzu, GC-14B, Serial No.9663) with a 
flame ionization detector (FID). Gas samples 
with known VOC contents were used for 
preparation of the calibration curve.  The 
dissolved VOC concentration in the liquid was 
determined by sealing a 3 mL liquid sample in 
a 43-mL sample vial, and the vial was then 
immersed in a water bath at 80
 o
C. As was 
verified experimentally in another study [11], a 
heating time of 10-20 minutes was required to 
get a thermal equilibrium between the liquid 
sample and the water in the bath. A gas sample 
taken from the tube was then analyzed to 
determine the VOC concentration. The 
concentration of the absorbed VOC in the 
liquid sample could thus be determined.  
Liquid samples with known VOC contents 
were used for calibration. Instrument integrity 
was verified by injecting VOC standards at the 
beginning and end of each analytical session 
and comparing the results to the standard 
calibration curve. The detection limit was 1 
mg/m3 for an injected gas sample of 1 mL.  
pH of the mixed liquor was measured by a pH 
meter (Model 761, Knick Co., Italy) 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Volumetric Oxygen- and VOC-transfer 
Coefficients 
Table 3 lists H, D and KLaVOC calculated 
from Eq. (6) at different superficial gas 
velocities U. KLaVOC increases slightly with 
increasing U in the range of 50-500 m/hr. This 
phenomenon might arise from the observed 
fact that many bubbles were formed so quickly 
and located so closely in the shallow liquid 
flowing over the plate that they tended to 
coalesce and the coalescing bubbles did not 
help in an significant increase of the specific 
gas-liquid interfacial area for VOC transfer. 
For design practice, it can reasonably be 
assumed that the KLaVOC for a specific VOC to 
be a constant in the operating U of 50-500 
m/hr. In the present study, however, KLaVOC 
for each operating U was substitute into Eq. 
(7) when verifying the model. 
VOC Treatment 
Data on the variations in the effectiveness of 
VOC removal at a liquid depth of Z for a fixed 
U of 48-720 m/hr and y0 of 150-450 mg/m3 
were obtained for the tested VOCs.

Figure 3 plots variations of toluene removal 
efficiency with plate number at fixed L/G 
ratios of 0.053 and 0.107 m3 mixed liquor/(m3 
gas) for U = 576 and 288 m/hr (influent gas 
flow rate = 600 and 300 L/min), respectively.  
Calculated values of the removal efficiency by 
the model equations (7) and (8) are also shown 
in the figure for verification of the model.  
Table 4 lists the input parameters to the model 
equations. During the experiments, it was 
observed that there was only a trace of toluene 
in the influent to the column and accordingly 
 8
efficiencies by the model equations using 
parameters shown in Table 4 are shown in the 
figure for comparison.  The kinetic constant k 
value for biodegradation of the absorbed VOC 
to the mixed liquor was estimated to be 490 
hr-1 by the method of least squares.  By Eq. 
(15) and the parameters shown in Table 4 ηmax 
were calculated to be 67 and 100% for L/G of 
0.155 and 0.620, respectively.  Compared 
ηmax with the experimental ηN=6 of 34 (L/G = 
0.155) and 58% (L/G = 0.620), it is apparent 
that additional plates can be used to absorb 
more p-xylene from the influent gas to 
improve the removal efficiency. 
Figure 5 shows variations of experimental 
and calculated IPA removal efficiencies with 
plate number at fixed L/G ratios of 0.001 and 
0.005 for U = 720 and 480 m/hr (influent gas 
flow rate = 750 and 500 L/min), respectively.

efficiency with plate number at fixed L/G and h 
(Symbols: experimental data; lines: calculated

Parameters for the calculations are shown in 
Table 4. The kinetic constant k value for 
biodegradation of IPA in the column was 
estimated to be 1000 hr-1 by the method of 
least squares. By Eq. (11) and the parameters 
shown in Table 4 ηmax were calculated to be 
15.4 and 77.8 % for L/G of 0.001 and 0.005, 
respectively. Experimental data show that a 
single plate of aerated liquid depth Z = 0.05 m 
was required to achieve an IPA removal of 
over 96% for both L/G at the high superficial 
velocities of 480 and 750 m/hr.  
Biodegradation of IPA in the column and the 
relatively higher water solubility of the VOC 
could be among the major reasons for the high 
removal efficiency.

Sensitivity Analysis of the Model 
Equations (7) and (8) indicate that the 
influent VOC removal efficiency (y0-yN)/y0 
depends on H, KLaVOC, Z, U, L/G, k, and xN+1.  
An effectiveness factor for the VOC removal 
by a plate column can also be defined as f = 
(y0-HxN+1)/(yN-HxN+1) for assessing effects of 
H, KLaVOC, Z, U, L/G, and k on this factor.  
The factor accounts for the ratio of the 
maximum driving force of the gaseous VOC in 
the gas influent plate (y0-HxN+1) for mass
