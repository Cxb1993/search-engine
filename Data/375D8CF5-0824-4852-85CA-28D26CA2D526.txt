Abstract 
Investigation on the origin of blue 
luminescence from Mg-doped AlGaN/GaN 
superlattices (SLs) is presented. The edge 
emission of the blue band shows an optical 
anisotropy with a line symmetry along c-axis 
as probed by the polarized luminescence. The 
blue band inherently exhibits a metastable 
behavior as demonstrated by the DC and AC 
photoluminescence (PL) measurements and 
the metastable behavior can be enhanced by 
thermal treatment. Our results establish that 
the underlying microstructure responsible for 
the blue luminescence in Mg-doped 
AlGaN/GaN SLs arises from the transitions 
involved in the threading structures decorated 
with Mg impurities/or other defects. 
 
 
P-type AlGaN/GaN superlattices (SLs) 
have been successfully used to fabricate 
AlGaN/GaN/InGaN multi-quantum-well 
lasers operating in continuous wave regime at 
room temperature for more than 10000 hours.1 
However, many aspects of Mg-doping are not 
yet fully understood. Recently, many reports 
noticed that the incorporation of Mg is often 
accompanied by the formation of extended 
defects. The pyramidal defects are observed 
with relatively high concentration of 1018 cm-3 
in Mg-doped GaN. 2,3 Planar defects such as 
stacking fault, inversion domain boundary, 
and stacking mismatch are found in GaN 
layers on sapphire, in addition to threading 
dislocation.4,5 Some of these extended defects 
are suspiciously related to the undetermined 
optical properties of such Mg-doped materials. 
Early reports focused on the effects of the 
 2
 4
emission of 3.3 eV at 15 K and the emission 
of 2.8 eV at 300 K in the Mg-doped 
AlGaN/GaN SLs investigated here may come 
from different transitions. As shown in Fig. 
1(b), the line shape of the 3.3 eV emission at 
15 K depends on the laser power density (0.12 
W/cm2 - 4.8 W/cm2). With decreasing the 
excitation intensity, the emission peak shifts to 
the lower energies, which agrees with the 
distant characteristic feature of donor-acceptor 
pair (DAP) transition in semiconductors.14 
Another characteristic of the DAP line is that 
the emission band narrows significantly with 
increasing excitation intensity. The band width 
of the emission band decreases markedly as 
shown in Fig. 1(b) with the increase of 
excitation power, which supports the DAP 
origin of the emission. 
To further elucidate the unique behaviors 
for the UV band and the blue band, we 
performed DC measurements on the PL 
spectra. To compare with the AC PL spectra, 
the EPD for DC measurements is as high as 
4.8 W/cm2 also. Figure 2 shows the 
temperature dependent DC PL spectra. At 15 
K, the spectrum has two main emission peaks 
centered at 3.0 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively. 
However, the 3.3 eV peak was soon quenched 
(above 75 K) as temperature increased. At 300 
K, the emission peak appears centered at 2.8 
eV. It is believed that the 2.8 eV peak at 300 K 
may be related to the 3.0 eV peak at 15 K. A 
lot of interesting features were found by 
comparing the DC PL spectra with the AC PL 
spectra. At room temperature (RT), only the 
2.8 eV blue band was found both in the DC 
and AC PL spectra. At low temperature, the 
3.3 eV UV band appears in both the DC and 
AC spectra, while the 3.0 eV blue band only 
appears in the DC PL spectra. As compared 
with the previous report8 and the temperature 
dependent DC PL spectra shown in Fig. 2, 
instead of the 3.3 eV band, the 3.0 eV band at 
15 K DC PL spectra is ascribed to the result of 
the temperature evolution of the 2.8 eV band 
observed at 300 K. Thus, the 2.8 eV band at 
300 K has the different origin with respect to 
that of the 3.3 eV band at 15 K. This is 
consistent with other reports that the blue 
band is due to the deep DAP 
recombination,6,10,11 while the UV band is due 
to the transition involving the shallow 
DAP.8,13  The emergence of the 3.0 eV blue 
band only in the DC PL spectra at low 
temperature indicates its slow response to 
optical interactions in contrast to the prompt 
response of the UV band. These peculiar 
features of the blue emission implies that the 
carrier transitions involves a long-term 
relaxation process, which is a signature that 
metastable defects15 are responsible for the 
blue emission in AlGaN/GaN SLs. A similar 
metastable effect has been reported in GaN 
films by the observation of a long-term decay 
in photoconductivity after the removal of 
optical excitation.16-19 Besides, the appearance 
of the blue band in the AC PL spectrum at RT 
implies the blue emission states at low 
temperature are metastable which can relax to 
deeper states as the temperature increases and, 
hence, result in a 2.8 eV blue band observed 
both in DC and AC PL at RT. Here, we 
emphasize that the measurement of DC PL 
spectra is very useful to clearly demonstrate 
the metastability induced by optical excitation. 
Along the clue of the possible 
metastability revealed by the DC and AC PL 
measurements, it is of interest to investigate 
the effect of the atomic microstructures on the 
optical properties of the AlGaN/GaN SLs. 
Previously, the measurement of the polarized 
PL spectra has been demonstrated to be able 
to probe chemical microstructures in 
semiconductor heterostructures.20 We 
therefore investigated for the first time the 
polarization dependence of the edge PL 
spectra of AlGaN/GaN SLs. The laser light 
was incident along the c-axis and the PL 
spectra were collected along the cleaved edge 
direction of the sample. Figure 3 shows the PL 
intensity with respect to the angle of analyzer 
taken at 15K and under EPD of 4.8 W/cm2. At 
the angle of 0 degrees, the polarization is 
parallel to the c-axis of the sample. It was 
 6
different charge state, they will relax and 
distort the lattice, and therefore exhibit a 
different optical property, such as the UV 
band is suppressed and the blue band is 
enhanced. It is a well-know fact that under 
different charge states, a defect or an impurity 
will suffer from lattice distortion and reach to 
a metastable state. This picture can be used to 
unify many reported behaviors of the blue and 
UV bands in AlGaN/GaN SLs. 
   In conclusion, we report the investigation 
on the blue and the ultraviolet luminescence in 
Mg-doped AlGaN/GaN superlattices (SLs). 
Through a careful examination on the PL 
spectra taken under different temperature and 
light illumination, or by the DC and the AC 
measurements, a clear signature of the 
metastability of the blue band at low 
temperature is established. Quite interestingly, 
the edge emission of the blue band shows an 
optical anisotropy with a line symmetry along 
the c-axis as probed by the polarized 
luminescence. Our results therefore firmly 
establish that the underlying microstructure of 
the blue luminescence in Mg-doped 
AlGaN/GaN SLs arises from the transitions 
involving in the line defects decorated with 
impurities/ or other defects. In addition, 
through the effects of increasing temperature, 
light illumination, and thermal annealing, we 
provide a possible picture to explain the 
interplay between the blue and the UV 
emission in AlGaN/GaN SLs.

Abstract 
 
Temperature, excitation power and 
polarization dependence of ultraviolet (UV) 
photoluminescence (PL) of InGaN/AlGaN 
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) grown on (0001) 
and (11-20) sapphire substrates were 
investigated. It appears that the LEDs grown 
on (11-20) sapphire substrates show higher 
integrated luminescent efficiency than that of 
the LEDs grown on (0001) sapphire substrates. 
From the experimental data, it is believed that, 
for the InGaN LEDs having reduced InN 
molar fraction in the InGaN well layer, the PL 
characteristics are determined by the 
competing status among the QW (or QD) 
radiative recombination, spatially localized 
radiative recombination and defect-induced 
nonradiative recombination. According to the 
results of polarization dependent 
edge-emitting PL measurements, the LEDs 
grown on (11-20) sapphire substrates were 
found to exhibit a QW-like behavior while the 
LEDs grown on (0001) sapphire substrates 
were observed to show a mixed QW/QD-like 
behavior. The polarization dependent edge 
emitting PL measurement is considered as a 
highly sensitive technique for the 
characterization of the nanostructures of 
InGaN MQW LEDs. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Group III-nitrides have become the most 
promising compound semiconductors for their 
vital roles in the applications of full-color 
displays and solid-state lightings in the past 
decade.1,2 For example, it is expected that 
using the ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs) to excite downconversion 
phosphors allows to enhance color rendering 
and power conversion efficiency of the 
LEDs.2-4 However, the emission efficiency of 
GaN-based UV LEDs reduces as the emission 
wavelength decreases. It is well known that 
indium phase separation (or 
fluctuation)-induced localized states in the 
InGaN well layers play major roles for 
achieving highly efficient blue and green 
InGaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) 
LEDs.5-8 Due to the small In molar fraction in 
the InGaN well layers of the MQW LEDs, it is 
considered that fewer localized states may 
 10
(11-20) sapphire is about 1.2 and 1.8 times 
higher than that of the one on (0001) sapphire 
at 10 K and RT, respectively. It has been 
reported that if the internal quantum efficiency 
(η) is 100% at 10 K,14,15 the RT quantum 
efficiency (ηRT) is ~16% for the LEDs grown 
on (0001) sapphire substrates. Although the 
LEDs grown on (11-20) sapphire substrates 
exhibit almost the same thermal quenching 
behavior as that of the ones grown on (0001) 
sapphire substrates, ηRT of the LED grown on 
(11-20) sapphire substrate is 1.6 times higher 
than that of the LED deposited on (0001) 
sapphire substrate. 
The in-plane localization of carriers is a 
well known phenomenon that is considered to 
enhance PL intensity of InGaN layers and 
QWs.16-20 The “s-shaped” dependence of PL 
peak energies, as shown in Fig. 2, was 
reported to originate from exciton localization 
effect, which is well known21 to result from 
the temperature-induced redistribution of 
electrons and holes among a quasicontinuum 
of energy states in disordered alloys. Eliseev 
et al.22 reported that the blue shift in 
luminescence peak energies compared to the 
values predicted by the Varshni’s formula can 
be interpreted by the effect of localized tail 
states assuming Gaussian-like distribution of 
the density of states for both the conduction 
band and the valence band. The temperature 
dependence of the luminescence peak E(T) 
could be described by the band-tail model: 
E(T) = E(0)-[αT2/(T+β)]-[σ2/kT]. Here, E(0) is 
the energy gap at 0 K while α and β are known 
as Varshni’s fitting parameters. σ indicates the 
degree of localization effect and k is the 
Boltzmann constant. In this case, a large value 
of σ implies a strong localization effect. As 
shown in Fig. 2, both LEDs exhibit the 
exciton localization behaviors. The σ value for 
the LED on (0001) sapphire was calculated to 
be ~ 19.0 meV in contrast to ~ 20.5 meV for 
the LED on (11-20) sapphire. Apparently, the 
influence of localization due to indium content 
fluctuation on energy gap is within fitting 
error for LEDs grown either on (0001) or on 
(11-20) sapphire substrates. 
Figure 3 shows typical Arrhenius plots of 
integrated PL intensity for InGaN MQW 
LEDs grown on (0001) and (11-20) sapphire 
substrates, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, 
the PL intensity of QW emission decreases as 
temperature increases. This is attributed to 
thermal overflowing of electrons (and/or holes) 
out of confined localized states followed by 
non-radiative recombination processes. The 
temperature dependence of the integrated PL 
intensity (IPL) was previously expressed as 
IPL(T)= I0/[1+α⋅exp(-Ea/kT)],23  where, T, k, 
I0 , α ,and Ea represent absolute temperature, 
Boltzmann constant, the scaling factor, the 
process rate parameter, and the activation 
energy, respectively. The results of curve 
fitting are also plotted in Fig. 3. Based on the 
fitting, the values of α and Ea for the LEDs 
grown on (0001) sapphire substrates are 
estimated being ~2.1 and ~13 meV, 
respectively, while those for the LEDs 
deposited on (11-20) sapphire substrates are 
~2.8 and ~16 meV, respectively. It shows that 
the α values and thermal activation energies of 
thermal quenching for the InGaN MQW LEDs 
are almost the same no matter whether they 
are grown on the same type of substrates or 
not. These results imply that the mechanism of 
non-radiative recombination process is the 
same for the InGaN MQW LEDs prepared on 
(0001) or (11-20) sapphire substrates. 
  To investigate the influence of QCSE20 on 
the emission efficiencies of the LEDs grown 
on (0001) and (11-20) sapphire substrates, PL 
measurements were conducted under various 
excitation powers. Figure 4 depicts typical RT 
excitation power-dependent PL spectra of the 
LEDs grown on (0001) and (11-20) sapphire 
substrates, respectively. It was found that high 
excitation power tended to result in blue shift 
in the emission energies of the LEDs 
deposited on both types of substrates because 
of the screening effect of photo-excited 
carriers. In this case, the average blue shift of 
the emission energies under power excitations 
ranging from 0.02 W/cm2 to 1W/cm2 for both 
 12
nonradiative recombination centers formed by 
threading dislocations(TDs).10,28 For the case 
of blue InGaN LEDs, it was found that 
relaxation of the compressive strain tends to 
enhance the PL intensity and result in red shift 
of the emission wavelength of LEDs because 
of the strong localized states in InGaN wells. 
In this case, the compressive strain relaxation 
was also reported to generate many stacking 
faults in the active region of the LED.29 
Recently, InGaN MQWs LEDs grown on 
(11-20) sapphire substrates were found to 
exhibit improved characteristics due to 
reduced lattice mismatch between LED 
structure and substrate. 30 It is worth to 
mention that the average full-width at 
maximum (FWHM) of the (0002) GaN 
DCXRD signals of the In0.1Ga0.9N MQWs in 
the LED structures grown on the (11-20) 
sapphire substrates is ~ 173 arcsec which is 
narrower than ~ 193 arcsec of the ones having 
the same LED structure deposited on (0001) 
sapphire substrates in this investigation. Thus, 
for the In0.1Ga0.9N/Al0.03Ga0.97N UV LEDs 
grown on (0001) sapphire substrates in this 
study, the large lattice mismatch between 
LED structure and (0001) sapphire substrate is 
believed to result in a lot of TDs in which In 
atoms might segregate so that InGaN QDs 
could have nucleated. The tendency of 
forming QDs in the In0.1Ga0.9N well layers of 
the MQWs is consistent with the mixed 
QW/QD-like behavior revealed by the 
measurements of polarization dependence of 
PL for the LEDs grown on (0001) sapphire 
substrates. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
   In conclusion, temperature-, excitation 
power- and polarization-dependent PL 
measurements were performed to explore the 
difference in the emission mechanism for the 
In0.1Ga0.9N/Al0.03Ga0.97N UV LEDs grown on 
(0001) and (11-20) sapphire substrates. It was 
found that there were almost no difference in 
the PL characteristics of the LEDs grown on 
both (0001) and (11-20) sapphire substrates. 
Nevertheless, the polarization dependent 
edge-emitting PL spectra of the LEDs grown 
on the (11-20) sapphire substrates were found 
to exhibit QW-like behaviors while those from 
the LEDs grown on the (0001) sapphire 
substrates tended to show mixed QW/QD-like 
properties. It is believed that, for the short 
wavelength InGaN LEDs having reduced In 
molar fraction in InGaN well layers, the PL 
characteristics are determined by the 
competing status among the QW (or QD) 
radiative recombination, spatially localized 
radiative recombination and defect-induced 
nonradiative recombination. The polarization 
dependent edge-emitting PL characterization 
was found to be sensitive enough so that the 
characteristics of In0.1Ga0.9N/Al0.03Ga0.97N 
MQW nanostructures are realized.

Abstract 
Temperature and time evolution of the 
photoluminescence (PL) intensity of bimodal 
ZnTe/ZnSe type-II quantum dots (QDs) were 
 14

the emitted light. 
    Figure 1 (a) shows three emission peaks 
at 2.80 eV, 2.38 eV, and 1.98 eV in the 10 K 
PL spectrum from the sample. PL emission at 
2.80 eV is attributed to the near band edge 
emission from the ZnSe buffer layer. To 
understand PL results further, PLE 
measurements were performed. The PLE 
spectra with detection energies set at 2.38 eV 
and 1.98 eV are shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1 
(c), respectively. In both spectra, beside the 
steep increase of PLE intensity at around 2.8 
eV due to the onset of the ZnSe fundamental 
absorption, additional peak structures were 
also detected. There is no absorption 
corresponding to ZnTe epilayer (2.4 eV at 10 
K) in PLE results. Thus, this implies the 
absence of wetting layers in the sample. The 
corresponding peak at 2.59 eV in Fig. 1(b) 
shows a large Stokes shift of 210 meV with 
respect to PL peak energy at 2.38 eV. 
Similarly, the Stokes shift between the PLE 
peak at 2.18 eV and the PL peak at 1.98 eV is 
as large as 200 meV. Previously, the 
morphology measurements by atomic force 
microscopy has shown the formation of the 
bimodal ZnTe QDs array.9 Here, by carefully 
comparing the PL spectrum with the PLE 
spectra, the broad structure near 2.38 eV is a 
signature of PL from small ZnTe QDs while 
the additional peak near 1.97 eV on the lower 
energy side of the PL spectrum is believed 
from the large ZnTe QDs. The observed large 
Stokes shifts between the PL and PLE peaks 
for this bimodal QDs are due to the dot size 
inhomogeneity. In Fig. 1, it should be 
emphasized that the PLE peak energy 
decreases across the energy gap of ZnTe of 2.4 
eV with the increasing dot size, which is 
unusual for type-I heterostructures. This 
behavior is explained by the type-II band 
alignment in which the transition between the 
ground level of the bulk ZnSe (conduction 
band) and the top of the valence band of the 
ZnTe QD is taken into account.10 This result is 
a direct confirmation of the type-II band 
alignment of the present ZnTe/ZnSe 
heterostructure grown under VW mode based 
on the PLE and PL measurements.11 
From the temperature dependent PL 
measurements, luminescent properties of the 
ZnTe QDs with different size populations 
were further investigated. Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) 
show the temperature dependence of the 
integrated PL intensity of small QDs and large 
QDs, respectively. The PL from the small 
ZnTe QDs becomes dominant (not shown) at 
room temperature, while the PL from the large 
ZnTe QDs becomes invisible or convolutes 
with that from the small ZnTe QDs. This 
shows a more pronounced PL intensity 
quenching for the large ZnTe QDs when the 
temperature increases. A Gaussian fit was 
used to analyze the PL spectra at higher 
temperatures and the PL intensities are 
normalized to their value at T = 10 K for both 
QDs. Fig. 2(a) shows a typical behavior for 
thermally activated nonradiative 
recombinations of the small QDs. The 
integrated PL intensity decreases very slowly 
between 10 and 50 K, and then decreases very 
rapidly at higher temperatures. The activation 
energy for thermally activated nonradiative 
recombinations can be obtained by the relation, 
IPL=I0exp(Ea/kT). Here T is temperature, k is 
Boltzman constant, I0 is constants, and Ea is 
the activation energy.12 By plotting log (IPL) vs 
1/T, as shown in the in Fig. 2(a), the activation 
energy responsible for the quenching of PL 
could be obtained. The activation energy 
obtained by this method is usually considered 
as the total binding energy,13 which includes 
 18
successive nonradiative recombinations with 
the centers located in the interfaces, the 
immediate vicinity between QDs and barrier. 
Thus, the particular temperature dependence 
of the integrated PL intensity of the large QDs 
is understood. 
    To further investigate the nature of the 
PL in the large and the small ZnTe QDs, 
time-resolved experiments were carried out. 
The experimental PL decay profiles (open 
circle) measured at main peaks for the small 
and the large dots are shown in Fig. 3(a) and 
3(b), respectively. The radiative decay of the 
small QDs is composed of a faster initial 
component and a slower tail component, 
whereas that of the large QDs comprises 
simply a fast component. From Fig. 3(a), the 
overall signals of the small QDs were seen to 
be better fitted by the thermalized stretching 
exponential line shape16 I(t) = I1exp(-t/τ1)+ 
I2exp(-t/τ2)β, where I(t) is the PL intensity at 
time t, I1 and I2 are I1(0) and I2(0), 
respectively, β is the scaling parameter that is 
related to the dimensionality of the localizing 
centers, τ1 and τ2 are the initial lifetimes. The 
fitting results are shown in Fig. 3(a) with time 
constants τ1 and τ2 of 0.9 and 21 ns 
respectively. The stretching parameter β = 0.6 
means that the localized states have spatial 
extension broader than Lorentzian form in the 
energy space.17 These results support the 
staggered lineup model of the ZnTe/ZnSe 
QDs inferred by the PLE measurements. After 
the excitation, electrons and holes are 
generated in the ZnSe region followed by a 
process of hole capturing into the ZnTe dot. A 
dipole layer is formed between the holes in the 
ZnTe dots and the electrons attracted from the 
surrounding ZnSe regions. This field-induced 
band-bending will confine the electron wave 
function closer to the ZnTe dots. Thus, the 
faster time constant is attributed to the 
increased spatial overlap due to the 
band-bending-induced electron confinement. 
When the majority of the carriers have 
recombined, the band-bending effect18 is 
negligible and the electron wave function is 
more spread out into the ZnSe regions. This 
will lead to a slow radiative recombination 
process between the holes in ZnTe dots and 
the electrons in ZnSe regions. The following 
stretched exponential decay probably shows a 
manifestation of the type II excitonic 
recombination process. While the large QDs 
(Fig. 3 (b)) only show a fast exponential decay 
with a decay time constant of 0.4 ns. The 
absence of the slow radiative component in 
the PL decay of the large dots could be 
understood if the nonradiative centers located 
in the immediate vicinity of the large QDs at a 
distance of the order of the charge-carriers 
wave function extent are considered. Some 
studies report on the presence of this kind of 
defect,19 which could be associated with the 
QDs formation.20 If only the quantum 
confinement effect is considered, the reduced 
spatial overlap is expected in the large QDs 
due to the reduced penetration of hole wave 
function into adjacent layers. And this can 
result in that the large QDs will show a slower 
decay than that of the small QDs in the 
recombination processes. In the present case 
of the large QDs, the strain-induced 
nonradiative recombination centers are likely 
to make the physics different. The 
nonradiative recombination centers first come 
into playing the carrier trapping, leading to a 
shorter decay time for the initial radiative 
recombination. After the faster initial radiative 
recombination, the process of slow radiative 
recombination will compete with the 
nonradiative recombination via the defect
