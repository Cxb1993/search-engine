Abstract 
This study analyzed the wear patterns of, and wear 
volume formulae for, cylindrically elongated 
acetabular cup liners. The geometric patterns of the 
wear surface were first classified, then wear volume 
formulae were derived by integral calculus. 
SolidWorks® software or published formulae were 
used to verify the accuracy of the proposed formulae. 
The analytical results showed that the wear shape of 
the liner can be categorized into seven wear patterns, 
including the special case of wear at 90°, and the 
seven corresponding wear formulae were derived. In 
addition, wear of the cylindrical elongation might 
add considerably to the volume loss of the liner, 
depending on the height and shape of the elongation 
and the depth and direction of the linear penetration, 
being maximally 21% in the investigated model. The 
proposed wear formulae and patterns will be useful 
for more accurate performance evaluation of existing 
hip components implanted in patients and for the 
designing of new hip components.

二、緣由與目的(Introduction) 
Tiny ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene 
(UHMWPE) debris generated by long-term friction 
between the artificial femoral head and the 
acetabular cup is known to reduce the longevity of 
total hip replacements [1-3].  
In the past, femoral head displacement has 
usually been regarded in terms of liner wear depth 
[4]. Many studies have analyzed 2D and 3D linear 
wear [5-8] and focused on the calculation of the 
acetabular cup volume loss [9-16]. Charnley [9] first 
stated that the wear volume could be calculated as 
the maximal cross-sectional area of the femoral head 
multiplied by the wear depth. However, Kabo [10] 
reported that the wear volume should not be based 
solely on wear depth, but also on the direction of 
femoral head movement. Nevertheless, some studies 
[13, 15] pointed out that the Kabo formula produced 
errors as high as 45%. Recently, Ilchmann et al. [16] 
compared several published formulae and proposed 
a new formula, which, however, has been found not 
to be sufficiently accurate [17]. The aim of this study 
was therefore to obtain a more accurate formula. 
Although acetabular cup liner loss is due to wear, 
creep, and/or the effects of the ageing of 
polyethylene [18-21], the present study did not 
attempt to distinguish between these different causes, 
but instead analyzed the shape of the bearing surface 
and the volume loss of worn regions at a given wear 
depth and direction. Once wear patterns are clearly 
clarified, related studies, such as gait simulation and 
stress analysis, can be more accurately performed. 
To be consistent with commonly used terminology, 
the volume calculated was the total volume loss, 
which is due to the effects of both wear and creep. 
 
三、材料與方法(Materials and Methods) 
Figure 1 is a basic diagram showing the 
geometric structure of an acetabular cup liner and 
the trajectory of femoral head movement. The liner 
is formed from a hemispherical shell and a 
cylindrical elongation (Fig. 1a). The length of the 
elongation is denoted as D. The hemispherical shell 
and artificial femoral head (Fig. 1b) have the same 
radius, r. The trajectory of the femoral head that 
penetrates the PE liner is assumed to be translational 
motion [9], and the displacement of the center of the 
femoral head, oo′ , is given by the wear depth, w [4]. 
The dashed and solid lines in Fig. 1b denote the 
starting and final position of the femoral head, 
respectively, and the arrow shows the direction of 
femoral head penetration. The maximal circular 
section of the femoral head, which is perpendicular 
to the penetration direction, translates from dc to ab. 
Both da  and cb  are line segments. 
A. Observation and classification of wear 
patterns 
Figure 5 shows that the volumes of 60 worn out 
region models generated by SolidWorks® were 
close to the wear volumes calculated using the 
proposed formulae. The maximal difference was 
about 0.04% (wear angle 20° and wear depth 1mm). 
All the wear volumes calculated using the proposed 
formulae satisfied the criteria proposed in our 
previous paper [17]. 
Except where stated otherwise, the diameter of 
the liner was 32 mm and the length of the cylindrical 
elongation 4 mm. Figure 6 compares the results 
obtained using the proposed formulae with those 
obtained using published formulae for a wear depth 
of 5 mm. The curve developed by Ilchmann is 
closest to that obtained using the proposed formulae; 
however, when the wear angle was 40–90°, the wear 
volume exceeded the maximal value, 
maxV . For 
detailed comparisons and discussions, please refer to 
Wu [17]. 
Figure 7 shows the percentage difference 
between the results obtained using the Ilchmann 
formula and the proposed formulae. The values 
obtained using the Ilchmann formula exceeded those 
yielded by the proposed formulae; when the wear 
depth was 5.0 or 1.0 mm, the maximal difference 
was about 6% or 12%, respectively. 
Figure 8 plots the wear volume curves for liners 
with and without a cylindrical elongation (D = 4 mm 
vs. D = 0 mm) at a wear depth of 5 mm. The solid 
curve represents the wear volume of a hemispherical 
liner (without elongation) and the space between the 
solid curve and dashed curve represents the wear of 
the elongation. Figure 9 shows the wear of the 
cylindrical elongation expressed as a percentage of 
the total wear volume. When the wear angle was 
varied from 0° to 70°, this percentage declined in a 
near-linear fashion from about 21% to 0%. When the 
wear angle exceeded 70°, the cylindrical elongation 
remained almost intact and all of the wear was 
associated with the hemispherical shell.

Wear of the hemispherical shell

on the height and shape of the elongation and the 
amount and direction of linear penetration. It may be 
further inferred that, when the edges in the entrance 
plane are oblique, as in currently used cups, the 
percentage of wear represented by wear of the 
elongation should be decreased. 
Derbyshire [13] published the theoretical 
determination of wear volume using numerical 
integration techniques, but no wear patterns or wear 
formulae were presented and the results were 
therefore hard to assess. Furthermore, the results 
were not validated. 
This study used the methods proposed in our 
previous paper [17] and verified that the proposed 
formulae and wear shapes are very accurate and 
reliable. The proposed formulae can be easily 
written as a computer program using Gaussian 
integration for clinical applications or implant 
designs. This work is the first to present all of the 
wear patterns and the wear volume formulae for 
acetabular cup liners with or without an elongation 
and provides a deeper understanding of the complex 
theory of wear volume calculation after total hip 
replacement. Bennett et al. [37] pointed out that 
pre-clinical laboratory wear testing of joint 
replacements is a vital evaluation tool for new 
implant materials and designs. Clarke et al. [25] also 
deemed that the role of laboratory studies is to 
isolate relevant aspects of performance by cup 
design. One alternative approach to experimental 
wear studies is computational modeling involving 
finite element analysis [38-40]. Recently, Matsoukas 
et al. [41] performed a mathematical optimization of 
implant components using a validated computational 
volumetric wear model as an objective function and 
concluded that the use of validated performance 
metrics as objective functions is possible in the 
optimization of total hip replacement prostheses.  
Any method for calculating the wear volume, 
including that used in our previous study [22] and 
here, is based on the assumption that the wear vector 
can be accurately measured. Although there might be 
some limitations in the accurate determination of the 
wear volume, the mathematic calculations using our 
method are correct and the proposed formulae have 
been shown to be the most accurate available. In this 
study, the wear surface of a cylindrically elongated 
liner was classified as one of seven wear patterns 
and the seven corresponding wear formulae were 
derived. 
We conclude that the use of a single formula to 
calculate the wear volume of an acetabular cup liner 
with a cylindrical elongation is not satisfactory. The 
proposed wear formulae and patterns will be useful 
in designing new hip components. Furthermore, an 
accurate calculation of the wear volume is also 
important in order to obtain a better understanding of 
loosening and osteolysis of cups made from 
conventional PE and probably those made from the 
modern highly crosslinked PE [42, 43, 3].
