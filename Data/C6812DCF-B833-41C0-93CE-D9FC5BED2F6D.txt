K over the entire composition range. The experimental tie line data were correlated to test
consistency with the Othmer-Tobias [1] and Bachman [2] equations. These new LLE data are also
correlated with the solution models of the NRTL [3] and the UNIQUAC [4]. Good quantitative
agreement was obtained with these models.
Experimental Section
Liquid-liquid equilibrium data for the ternary systems were measured by an apparatus similar
to that of Peschke and Sandler [5]. The composition of sample was analyzed by a GC with TCD and
using high purity helium (99.99%) as a carrier gas. A stainless steel column packed with 10 %
Porapak Qs 60/80 (2 m1/8") can clearly separate the constituent compounds of the samples.
Five samples were replicated for each phase at a fixed experimental condition and the area fraction
was converted into mole fraction by the calibration equations. Two calibration lines were
previously constructed according to the organic-rich or the water-rich phases for each binary system.
The experimental mole fractions for each phase were obtained by averaging the results from these
five replications.
Experimental Results
The LLE measurements were made at temperatures 288.15 K and 318.15 K under atmospheric
pressure. Figures 1 to 3 are the phase diagrams for the ternary systems of water + 1-propanol +
methyl methacrylate, water + 1-propanol + butyl methacrylate, and water + 1-propanol + isobutyl
methacrylate at 288.15 K, respectively. Because water / methacrylic is the only pair that is
partially miscible, all investigated ternary systems behave as a Type 1 of LLE. Very small
amounts of the organic compounds were found in the aqueous phase, while water dissolved
appreciably in the organic-rich phase, especially near the plait point. As seen from the figures 1 to
3, the area of the two-phase region primarily depends on the mutual solubilities of water and the
methacrylics (the edge of water / methacrylic binary). The magnitude of solubility of water in the
methyl methacrylate is greater than in the butyl methacrylate or in the isobutyl methacrylate at the
