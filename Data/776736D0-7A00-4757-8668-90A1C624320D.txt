switched capacitor method which is bothered by 
parasitic capacitance and difficult frequency tuning 
control, the switched inductance technique can achieve 
a more accurate oscillation frequency and easy  
frequency tuning control. 
 
2     Circuit Design 
 
The quality value is infinity in an ideal LC tank 
oscillator circuit. However the quality value is poor in 
an integrated circuit due to the poor quality of the 
integrated inductor. Here we used a negative 
differential conductance circuit to compensate for the 
circuit quality and guarantee a stable resonance signal 
from the oscillator. The circuit shown in Fig. 1 consists 
of two stages. The first stage circuit, the MOS M1-M4, 
which is a cross-coupled pair forming a positive 
feedback loop that generates negative resistance. The 
second stage circuit is an output buffer circuit that 
includes Mb1, Mb2, and two inductors. This buffer 
stage can avoid the influence of other circuits in the 
system.  
Changing the tuning voltage Vc to control the 
resonance frequency and obtain the fine tuning range.     
The  actual frequency of oscillation fo is determined by

where delta C is the change in capacitance due to 
the varactor. L is  the inductance.  Hence,  high 
Cv,max/ Cv,min  and Cv/ Cparasitic ratio can reach a 
wider frequency tuning range [10]. Since

where Cv is the capacitance of varactor and 
Cparasitic is the parasitic capacitance. This parasitic 
capacitance mainly comes from the gate capacitors of 
Mb1and Mb2 and drain parasitic capacitors of M1-M8. 
To increase the frequency tuning range we need to 
increase the Cv / Cparasitic ratio.  The parasitic 
capacitance can be reduced by properly choosing Mb1 
and Mb2 sizes. A short channel length will lead to a 
lower equivalent series resistance and good quality 
factor. However, the value Cv,max / Cv,min will 
decrease with the channel length. For shorter channel 
length the weighting of overlap capacitance will 
increase. The device parasitical characteristics 
degenerate the effective varactor tuning ability. 
In general, we desire to have a large on-chip 
inductor for the resonator. Large on-chip inductor has 
better Q value and phase-noise performance. Due to 
CMOS process the on-chip inductor is not tunable. 
Large inductor will need a small Cv to reach the high 
oscillation frequency. However, this small Cv will 
reduce the frequency tuning range. This effect imposes 
a design tradeoff between frequency tuning and phase 
noise.  Several considerations are employed to design 
the VCO: 1) for low-power low-phase noise VCO 
optimization, the inductance value needs to be 
increased and, therefore, the varactors must be scaled 
down  [10]11].  2) large Cv / Cparasitic and Cv,max / 
Cv,min ratios must be considered for getting better 
frequency tuning.  3) process variations in the 
capacitor and in the inductors must be compensated to 
obtain the desired oscillation frequency. 
 
 
3    Simulation Results  
 
The VCO circuit is designed and fabricated in 
TSMC’s 0.18-μm  CMOS process. The process offers 
six metal layers for interconnect, and various kinds of 
RF inductors and varactors. The physical dimensions of 
the VCO  chip is 1.17 × 0.65 mm 2  including pads.  
The  VCO die photo is shown in  Fig. 2. The VCO 
performance is measured on wafer by using the  
Agilent  E5052A spectrum analyzer.  
 
A. Tuning range 
 
The simulated and measured frequency spectrum 
for 10-GHz and 7-GHz bands are shown in Fig. 3 and 
4, respectively.  The measured resonance frequency 
output can be adjusted from 7.36 GHz to 8.07 GHz. 
The tuning ranges as shown in Fig. 5 and 6 for 
measured and simulated results are 710 MHz and 1240 
MHz, respectively. While there is discrepancy between 
simulation and measurement results in 10-GHz 
frequency band. This discrepancy mainly comes from 
the over estimated inductance. The practical 
inductance is lower than the theoretical inductance 
value. 
 
B. Phase noise 
 
The phase noise is one of the most important 
performance characteristics in the oscillator. It will 
influence the jitter from the output waveform in the 
time domain. From the simulation results, the phase 
noise is -114 dBc/Hz @1 MHz at 10 GHz.  While the

4 Conclusion 
 
This paper presented a 1.5 V, negative-resistance 10 
GHz CMOS RF VCO design. It utilizes the negative-
resistance enhanced technique to increase the 
oscillation frequency response.  This method provides 
quickly frequency change with 10GHz band. The 
power consumption is 13.5 mW for VCO operated in 
7-GHz band. The negative-resistance enhanced VCO 
shows phase noises performances of -114 dBc/Hz at 1-
MHz offset frequency for 7 GHz.  The VCO can have 
a wide 9 % frequency tuning range in both frequency 
bands. Table II summarizes the performance of the 
VCO and compares it with recently published VCOs.
