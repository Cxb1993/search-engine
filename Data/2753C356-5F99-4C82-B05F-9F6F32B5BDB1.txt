前言: 
Regenerative gene therapy is a promising strategy to guide new tissue formation. To spatially control 
gene delivery, we have ever locally delivered viral vectors from biomaterial scaffolds. Using physical 
adhesion or chemical bioconjugation, adenoviral vectors have been localized or immobilized on material 
surfaces. These strategies demonstrated that gene delivery was controlled to in situ transduce cells adhered 
and grew on scaffolds. Although these studies suggest that controlled of viral vectors may improve 
transduction efficiency, there are still some risks of using viral vector for gene delivery, such as immunogenic 
response, host reaction, and mutation due virus insertion. Therefore, to develop a nonviral vector delivery 
should be facilitate the application of gene therapy to regeneration medicine. 
 
研究目的： 
To improve the transfection efficiency of nonviral vectors, a substrate-mediated gene delivery would be 
developed using biotin-avidin interaction.

Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Gene Therapy 
Transplantation is a generally accepted medical treatment to reconstitute damaged organ or tissue caused 
by trauma, accident, or tumor [1-3]. Although organs or tissues from patients or donors are frequently able to 
repair defect sites and recover function, the limited tissue sources, repeated surgeries, as well as the risks of 
infection and immunogenic response suggest that this medical technique is incapable of being widely applied 
[4]. To overcome these difficulties, engineering approaches have been applied in defects to facilitate tissue 
regeneration, which is called tissue engineering [5, 6]. The main idea of tissue engineering is to culture 
appropriate cells in biocompatible scaffolds combined with appropriate bioactive factors to direct target tissue 
grow [7]. In the coordination of bioactive factor, cells, and scaffolds, damaged tissues may be repaired to 
restore normal function [8]. 
 
Since the goal of tissue engineering is to repair and regenerate new tissues by mimicking natural 
processes, one tissue engineering strategy to regenerate tissue is to deliver cell-signaling factors directly from 
biomaterials. In this paradigm, fine control over the release of bioactive factors plays a critical role for tissue 
regeneration. In most studies to date, protein-based bioactive factor delivery has typically used an 
encapsulated carrier with scaffolds for controlled release [9-11]. These devices are designed to control the 
release rate of growth factors. However, physiologic release patterns are difficult to attain [12]. In addition, 
implanted growth factors may be enzymatically inactivated and unable to maintain activity during the desired 
therapeutic period. The high cost of milligram dosage needed is also impractical. Therefore, regenerative gene 
therapy may provide an alternative approach by which transduced cells function as mini reactors to produce 
bioactive signals in vivo [13]. This gene therapy approach may improve control over the timing, distribution, 
and the concentration of multiple regenerative factors. 
 
Gene Delivery 
Conventional regenerative gene therapy is to directly deliver gene vehicles by injection or inhalation [14, 
15]. However, these bolus deliveries may cause gene vehicles diffuse immediately after implantation and lead 
to systemic infection as well as a serious immune response [16, 17]. In our pervious studies, we have 
established different strategies to deliver genes by either localizing or immobilizing adenovirus with 
biomaterials [18-21]. Only cells adhered on biomaterial scaffolds would be in situ transduced by these 
DNA product was used in the following in vitro experiments. 
 
Biotinylation of chitosan 
To immobilize chitosan vehicles on avidin treated surfaces, more SulfoNHS-LC-Biotin conjugating to 
chitosan molecules should increase the binding force to biomaterials. However, the reduction of amine groups 
may decrease positive charge density. Therefore, the level of biotinylation should be high enough to make 
chitosan maintain on avidin substrate but still can stably complex plasmid DNA. We tried to use different 
concentration of SulfoNHS-LC-Biotin to modify chitosan. Different concentrations of avidin were coated on 
96-well microplates to bind biotinylated chitosan. 
 
The Physical Properties of Chitosan-DNA Complexes 
Because the molecular weight (MW) of chitosan plays an important role in transfection [42], different 
MW of chitosan were compared in this study (5kDa, 10 kDa, and 15kDa). Since the surface charge densities 
may affect the efficiencies of gene delivery [43], chitosan-DNA nanoparticles were analyzed by their 
zeta-potential to determine the surface charge of the complex. The complex particle sizes were also detected 
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) to examine the size distribution. In order to determine DNA loading 
capacities, the supernatant of complex particles was detected by EtBr fluorescent dye that the unloaded DNA 
were stained to determine the encapsulation efficiency. Finally, the released DNA was illustrated by the 
electrophoresis. 
 
In vitro studies for transfection 
DNA/chitosan nanoparticles with different MW and N/P ratio were used for gene delivery. Human 
embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293T) was used to evaluate gene transfer efficiency. Nanoparticles were 
mixed with serum free DMEM and incubated with cells overnight. And the transfected medium were replaced 
by normal culture medium (D-MEM with 10% FBS). Plasmids encoding LacZ was used in this study. After 48 
hr, the transfected cells were analyzed. Ortho-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) substrate was used 
to analyze the expression of transfected beta-galactosidase. To evaluate if these nonviral vector induced 
cytotoxicity during transfection, we also performed MTS and LDH analyses to determine the activities and 
survival rate of the transfected cells. 
 
結果與建議： 
Determine appropriate MW of chitosan for DNA delivery 
Chitosan with different appropriate MW were used to complex with plasmids encoding beta-gal genes by 
different N/P ratio. After 48 hr transfection, the β-galactosidase expressions were examined by ONPG 
substrate and the expression level were normalized by protein amount. The result (Fig 1) suggests that 
chitosan with MW=10kDa had the best transfection ability than chitosan with other MW. Its β-galactosidase 
expression was close to the commercial transfection kit (Lipofectamine). Therefore, we used this chitosan for 
our following biotinylation experiments. 
 
The biotinylation of chitosan 
 To immobilize chitosan/DNA nanoparticle, biotin was conjugated to amine groups of chitosan by 
different ratio of biotinylation reagent (wt % of chitosan: Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin from 1:3 to 1:0.03. The 
non-modified group was 1:0). The conjugation efficiencies were evaluated by HABA assays [20] (Fig 2). 
Although the conjugation efficiencies decrease with the increasing concentration of Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin 
more chitosan per nanoparticles (Fig 4c). However, there were no obvious relationship between the level of 
biotinylation and the particles, suggesting that biotinylation did not affect the formation of chitosan/DNA 
nanoparticles (Fig 4d). Most sizes of the nanoparticle were range between 70-110nm. This result was 
consistent to the SEM image (Fig 3). Only the group of N/P=1 and biotinylation ratio=1:3 had an extremely 
large size (578nm). It was consistent with their cloudy appearance.

The encapsulation of biotinylated chitosan to DNA 
The encapsulation rate of nanoparticle varied with the N/P ratio and the level of biotinylation. Higher 
N/P ratio groups had more chitosan to absorb DNA, and thus caused a better encapsulation (Fig 5a). The 
biotinylation used up amine groups and thus reduced the attracting force to DNA, causing lower encapsulation 
rates (Fig 5b). Most of the encapsulation can be higher than 65% except the group of N/P=1 and biotinylation 
ratio=1:3 which only had the encapsulation rate of 43%. The same results also can be found by 
electrophoresis analysis. From Fig 6 we found that the encapsulation efficiencies of biotinlyated chitosan were 
reduced. When chitosan: biotin=1:3, DNA could not be loaded completely until N/P≧20. The electrophoresis

the binding force to gene delivery, different concentrations of avidin were coated on 96-well ELISA plates to 
immobilize DNA/chitosan nanoparticles on biomaterial surfaces. Different N/P ratio were test in this study, 
however, we only listed the result of N/P ratio with the best transfection efficiency per biotinylation group. 
The LacZ gene was delivered in this study and the expression ofβ-galactosidase was analyzed by ONPG 
substrate (Fig 8). For the non-avidin coating plate (tissue culture plate, TCPs), biotinylated chitosan enhanced 
β-galactosidase expression (from 1.76 to 3.70 ug/mg protein). It may due to that the amines of chitosan was 
reduced for biotinylation. However, too high levels of biotinylation (1:3) may result in a lower transfection 
efficiency, which may due to lower encapsulation efficiency (Fig 5b). When the biotinylated chitosan/DNA 
nanoparticles immobilized on low concentrations of avidin coated plates (0.0001 and 0.001mg/ml), the 
transfection efficiency can be improved to more than 3 times compared to the non-modified group on TCPs 
(5.73 and 6.01 ug/mg protein, respectively). When the coated concentrations were higher (0.01 and 0.1mg 
avidin/ml), the transfection results was close to TCPs group. Furthermore, the highest concentration of avidin 
coating (1mg avidin/ml) even caused a negative effect to gene delivery. These results suggested that an 
appropriate binding force may maintain nanoparticles on material surfaces (0.0001 and 0.001mg/ml), however, 
too high of avidin (1mg avidin/ml) may own a strong interaction to biotinylated chitosan that the 
nanoparticles were thus unable to be uptake by the adhered cells.

Conclusion 
In this study, we successfully developed chitosan/DNA nanoparticles for gene delivery. The size and 
surface charge of nanoparticles made by chitosan with various N/P ratio and the biotinylation rates were 
examined. We also demonstrate the encapsulation efficiencies of these nanoparticles. Biotinylation treatment 
of chitosan did not cause cytotoxicity and even improved cell activity. The transfection efficiencies were 
determined by LacZ gene with beta-gal assay. Finally, biotinylated chitosan was used to form nanoparticles 
and was immobilized on avidin coated surfaces. The result suggested that biotinylation can improve 
transfection efficiency when the conjugation ratio was modest (wt. % of 1:1 to 1:0.1 of chitosan to 
sulfoNHS-LC-biotin) at low avidin coated plates (0.0001 and 0.001mg/ml). These results demonstrate that 
biotinylated chitosan can be an enhanced carrier polymer for gene delivery.
