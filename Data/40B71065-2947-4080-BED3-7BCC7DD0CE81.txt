1. 中文摘要
本研究探討有分派數目限制的轉運點位
址問題，相較於其它兩極的轉運網絡之研究
(單一分派 (single allocation)與多重分派
(multiple allocation))，由於本研究有考量到合
理的分派數目限制，所以較符合實務的情
境。另外，由於轉運點須建置額外的設施，
才能提供集中、轉運的功能，因此將建置轉
運點所需的個別建置成本納入考量，亦較符
合實務的情境。
轉運網絡由所有 n 個互動的節點(node)
所構成，其中有 p 個會被設為轉運點(hub)(p
為決策的一部份)。轉運點間完全相互連結，
在網絡中擔任集中、轉運的角色，非轉運點
(non-hub)必須經由連結轉運點來相互連結。
影響轉運網絡效益的關鍵因素在於決定轉運
點的數目、轉運點的位址、各起迄對
(origin-destination)的路徑，以使網絡間的總
成本最小化，此總成本包括：(1)起點至轉運
點(origin-hub)的收集成本；(2)轉運點間(inter
hubs)的運輸成本； (3)轉運點至終點
(hub-destination)的配送成本；以及(4)轉運點
的個別建置成本。由於此研究問題是 NP-hard
的問題，其通常無法在合理時間內求得最佳
解。本研究發展了決定轉運點數目、轉運點
位址和各起迄對(origin-destination)路徑的程
序，並結合模擬退火法(simulated annealing)
與禁忌名單(tabu list)，提出了能在合理時間
內求得最佳解/近似最佳解的啟發式解法。而
為測試本研究之混合啟發式解法的穩健性，
本研究修改文獻的例題來作測試。測試結果
顯示，本研究的啟發式解法可很有效率地求
出小問題的最佳解；而當求解大問題時，本
研究的啟發式解法遠優於測試的隨機降坡演

Abstract
This research deals with the hub location
problems with allocation constraints.
Compared to the other studies of the hub
location problems, this research is more
appropriate for practical situations, since the
allocation of each non-hub to the hubs is
properly constrained. Furthermore, hubs
usually require additional facilities in order to
service other nodes, it is more appropriate to
treat the number of hubs as a decision variable
and to include the associated installation costs
in the objective function.
In hub-and-spoke networks, all hubs
which act as switching points for internodal
flows are interconnected and none of the
non-hubs are directly connected (i.e., all flow
must be routed through the hubs). The key
factors for designing a successful hub-and-
spoke network are to determine the optimal
number of hubs, to locate the hubs, and to
determine the path for each origin-destination
pair, such that the total cost is minimized.
The total cost includes (1) the collection cost
occurred during the transportation from
non-hubs to their allocated hubs; (2) the
transfer cost occurred during the transportation
between hubs; (3) the distribution cost occurred
during the transportation from the allocated
3fraction of flow from origin i to destination j
routed via hubs k and m in that order; Fk be the
fixed cost of establishing hub k; Zkk = 1 if node
k is a hub, and 0 otherwise; Zik = 1 if node i can
be allocated to hub k, and 0 otherwise; h be the
number of hubs that each non-hub can be
allocated. This hub location problem may be
formulated as
Min 

The objective function is to minimize the total
costs of collection, transfer, distribution, and
establishing hubs. Constraint (1) enforces the
flow between every origin-destination pair to
be routed via some hub pair. Constraint (2)
requires that each non-hub can only be
allocated to h hubs. Constraint (3) assures
that each flow can only be routed via hubs
Constraint (4) enforces Zik to be one if there is
any flow between node i and hub k.
Constraint (5) enforces Zjm to be one if there is
any flow between node j and hub m.
3. Hybrid heuristic
The hybrid heuristic for solving this type
of hub location problems, HEU_SA, may be
divided into three tiers: the first tier is to
determine the number of hubs; the second tier
is to locate the hubs; and the third tier is to
determine the path for each origin-destination
pair. The procedures for these three tiers are
described as follows.
3.1 Determining the number of hubs
In order to obtain the optimal/near optimal
solution efficiently, we can employ lower and
upper bounds for the number of hubs.
According to previous research on hub-and-
spoke networks, the transportation cost
decreases as the number of hubs increases.
Hence, the optimal number of hubs (p) is equal
to p’-1 if the marginal reduction of the
transportation cost is greater than the increase
in fixed cost when p =p’-1 and no greater than
the increase in fixed cost when p = p’. A
pseudo-lower bound can be set to be h, in
which h is the number of hubs that each
non-hub can be allocated.
3.2 Selecting hub locations
For locating good hub facilities, the
elements included in the objective function
must be taken into account, i.e., the flows and
distance between each pair of nodes. In this
research index Ii = (Wi /jWj) - (Ci /jCj) of
each node (i) is considered when generating
initial hub locations and neighborhood
solutions, where Wi =j(Wji+Wij) is the
weighted total flow to and from node i (δ is the 
unit distribution cost and χ is the unit 
collection cost), Ci is the total distance
between node i and the other nodes.
3.2.1 Generating initial hub locations
Let k be the center of mass of the network
and (xk, yk) be the coordinate of node k. That
is, the coordinate of k is
(( ) / , ( ) / )i i i i i i
i i i i
x m m y m m    , where mi is the
mass of node i and is set to be  
j
jiij WW 2/))(( .
When generating initial hub locations, regard k
as the origin. All the nodes are then divided
into p groups. For example, if there are two
hubs (i.e., p=2), group 1 contains all the nodes
within the half-plane above the 0and 180
rays (i.e., group 1 contains all the nodes lying
between the 0and 180rays), and group 2
contains all the nodes within the half-plane
below the 180and 360rays. If there are
three hubs, group 1 contains all the nodes
within the region formed by the 0and 120
rays, group 2 contains all the nodes within the
region formed by the 120 and 240 rays,
and so forth. From each group, the node
which has Ii value within the top 70% of the
5the number of hubs for another pilot
run).
Step 6. Update the temperature. If the
stopping criterion is reached, stop the
whole procedure. Otherwise, return
to Step 3.
4. Computational results
In this section, the CAB and AP data sets
from the literature are modified to evaluate the
computational characteristics of HEU_SA.
The performance of HEU_SA is compared with
the optimal solutions obtained by Cplex and a
RDH heuristic. Both heuristics were coded in
C++ and all of the experiments were performed
on a Pentium IV 3.2 GHz PC.
4.1 Data sets
In our experiment, the number of hubs that
each non-hub can be allocated (i.e., h) was set
to be 2 and 3, respectively. The CAB data set
was introduced by O’Kely [13].  It was based 
on airline passenger flows between 25 US cities.
The flow is symmetric and the fixed cost is the
same for all nodes. Four problem sizes were
considered: the first ten cities; the first fifteen
cities; the first twenty cities; and all twenty-five
cities. For each problem size (n) the unit
collection cost (i.e., χ) and the unit distribution
cost (i.e.,δ) were both equal to 1, while the unit
transportation cost on the inter-hub links (α)
was set to be 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively.
In order to use this data set to test this type of
hub location problems, the fixed cost for
establishing a hub (F) was set to be 40, 50, and
60, respectively. (Note that by reducing the
fixed cost, the optimal solutions would contain
more hubs and each non-hub may connect with
more hubs if the allocation constraint were
relaxed.)
The AP data set was introduced by Ernst
and Krishnamoorthy [14]. It was derived
from the mail flows in an Australia city and
contains 200 nodes each representing a postal
district. The flow was not symmetric (i.e., Wij
≠ Wji) and Wii≠ 0. For small-scale problems,
five problem sizes were considered: 10, 20, 25,
40, and 50 nodes. For large-scale problems,
two problem sizes were considered: 100 and
200 nodes. For each type of problem (t), two
versions of fixed costs were considered: loose
and tight. For the tight version, the fixed
costs were higher for the nodes with larger total
flows. In order to use this data set to test this
type of hub location problems, the unit
collection cost was set to be 5.5, the unit
transportation cost on the inter-hub links was
set to be 3.0, the unit distribution cost was set
to be 4.5, and the fixed cost was set to be the
half of the original fixed cost.
4.2 Computational Results
Computational results are reported in this
subsection. The reported solutions of
HEU_SA and RDH were based on running
both heuristics ten times each with a different
random seed. First, parameter settings are
described.
4.2.1 Parameter settings
The initial solution of RDH was generated
by randomly selecting 10% to 90% of the
nodes to be hubs. Each non-hub was then
allocated randomly to h hubs and the shortest
path algorithm was applied to determine the
path for each origin-destination pair. Then,
RDH applied four types of transitions,
commonly found in the literature, to generate
neighborhood solutions:
AddHub: Set a randomly selected non-hub to
be a hub.
DeleteHub: Set a randomly selected hub to be a
non-hub. The non-hubs originally allocated to
this hub were randomly reallocated.
ReallocateNode: Reallocate a randomly
selected non-hub from one hub to another hub.
RelocateHub: Exchange a randomly selected
hub with a randomly selected non-hub.
After a transition was performed, the shortest
path algorithm was again applied to determine
the path for each origin-destination pair. The
probabilities of selecting the above transitions
were set at 0.05, 0.05, 0.40 and 0.50,
respectively. The algorithm for the RDH is
stated as follows:
for i = 1,…,2n
generate an initial feasible solution
7The effectiveness of the proposed
heuristic, we believe, is ascribed to the
restricted exchange procedure and the
allocation procedure developed in this research.
As for future research, it may be desirable to
extend this research to the capacitated case.
Considering that the cost for establishing a hub
is a discrete function of capacity is another
important issue for future research to pursue.

本研究對有分派數目限制及有個別建置成本的轉運點位
址問題進行探討。本研究發展了決定轉運點數目、轉運點位
址和各起迄對(origin-destination)路徑的程序，並結合模擬退
火法(simulated annealing)與禁忌名單(tabu list)，提出了能在
合理時間內求得最佳解/近似最佳解的啟發式解法。而為測試
本研究之混合啟發式解法的穩健性，本研究修改文獻的例題
來作測試。測試結果顯示，本研究的啟發式解法可很有效率
地求出小問題的最佳解；而當求解大問題時，本研究的啟發
式解法遠優於測試的隨機降坡演算法。
