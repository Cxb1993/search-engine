In this study, ambient air samples from different atmospheric environments were examined for both
PBDE and PCDD/F characteristics to verify that combustion is a signiﬁcant PBDE emission source. The
mean ± SD atmospheric PBDE concentrations were 165 ± 65.0 pg Nm3 in the heavy steel complex area
and 93.9 ± 24.5 pg Nm3 in the metals complex areas, 4.7 and 2.7 times higher than that (35.3 ±
15.5 pg Nm3) in the urban areas, respectively. The statistically high correlation (r = 0.871, p < 0.001)
found between the atmospheric PBDE and PCDD/F concentrations reveals that the combustion sources
are the most likely PBDE emission sources. Correspondence analysis shows the atmospheric PBDEs of
the heavy steel and metals complex areas are associated with BDE-209, -203, -207, -208, indicative of
combustion source contributions. Furthermore, the PBDEs in urban ambient air experience the inﬂuence
of the evaporative releases of the commercial penta- and octa-BDE mixtures, as well as combustion
source emissions. By comparing the PBDE homologues of indoor air, urban ambient air, and stack ﬂue
gases of combustion sources, we found that the lighter brominated PBDEs in urban ambient air were con-
tributed by the indoor air, while their highly brominated ones were from the combustion sources, such as
vehicles. The developed source identiﬁcation measure can be used to clarify possible PBDE sources not
only for Taiwanese atmosphere but also for other environmental media in other countries associated
with various emission sources in the future.

1. Introduction
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), structurally similar to
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs)
and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), have been extensively used
as brominated ﬂame retardants (BFRs) in a large variety of con-
sumer products. However, concern has risen because animal and
epidemiological studies show PBDEs exposure can cause liver tox-
icity, developmental neurotoxicity, and may relate to metabolic
obesity (Chao et al., 2007; Herbstman et al., 2007; Main et al.,
2007; EPA, 2009). Total PBDEs in breast milk were found associated
positively with the serum of luteinizing hormone (Main et al.,
2007). Prenatal PBDE exposures were signiﬁcantly related to de-
creased total and free thyroxine levels (Herbstman et al., 2007).
Our previous study also showed that increased PBDEs in breast
milk was related with decreased birth weight and length (Chao
et al., 2007). The commercial penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE
mixtures have been banned within the European Union (European
Court of Justice, 2008). No new manufacturing or importing of
commercial penta-BDE and octa-BDE mixtures has been allowed
in the US (2009). Nevertheless, the use of PBDEs is still not re-
stricted in Taiwan.
Many studies have reported that environmentally ubiquitous
PBDEs are mainly the result of using PBDE-containing products in-
doors (Prevedouros et al., 2004; Harrad and Hunter, 2006; Sakai
et al., 2006). Schenker et al. (2008) calculated global PBDE dis-
charges from production, use and waste-management, and found
that they underestimated global PBDE emissions. Their model’s
prediction was close to ﬁeld data from environmental measure-
ments only on simulating a ‘‘worst case’’ by using emission factors
based on vapor pressure, high values for PBDE production, and
PBDE containing waste partially burnt in open ﬁre. It needs to be
noted that PBDE emission estimation from the vapor pressures of
PBDE congeners could be two orders higher than that evaluated
from their KOA (Prevedouros et al., 2004).
PBDE emissions from stationary and mobile combustion
sources to the atmosphere were not included in the mentioned

ion monitoring (SIM) was used with a resolving power of 10 000.
The electron energy and source temperature were speciﬁed at
35 eV and 250 C, respectively. The detailed instrumental analysis
parameters of PBDEs and PCDD/Fs are given in our previous works
(Wang et al., 2003a, 2010a). The quality assurance and quality con-
trol (QA/QC) are described in Supplementary material, which in-
cluded the pre-cleaning procedures of quartz ﬁber ﬁlters and PUF
plugs, ﬁeld and laboratory blanks, as well as the recoveries of the
surrogate and internal standards (Table S2).
2.5. Statistical analysis
Correspondence analysis (CA) is a descriptive and exploratory
technique designed to investigate cross-classiﬁed data containing
some measure of correspondence. CA is conceptually similar to
principal component analysis (Wang et al., 2003b), but applies to
categorical data. In this study, we use CA to compare PBDE congen-
ers of the ambient air samples (n = 34) from the heavy steel com-
plex (HI1–HI11), the metals complex (I1–I9), and urban areas
(U1–U14) to those of the commercial PBDE mixtures (Hoh and
Hites, 2005; La Guardia et al., 2006) and combustion sources
(Wang et al., 2010b, 2010c) in an attempt to identify PBDE sources.
For a comprehensive description of this method, mathematics, and
its applications, refer to the book by Greenacre (1984). CA was car-
ried out using the STATISTICA version 8 software in this study.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. PBDE and PCDD/F concentrations in ambient air
The total (summation of gaseous and particulate phases) of
PBDE and PCDD/F ambient air concentrations in the heavy steel
complex, metals complex, and urban areas in Taiwan are listed in
Table 1. The PCDD/F concentration (mean: 0.135 pg I-TEQ Nm3)
in the heavy steel complex area was 4.8 times higher than that
in the urban areas. Its elevated PCDD/F I-TEQ concentration has
been attributed to the PCDD/F emissions from the metallurgical
facilities, including EAFs, secondary ALSs, and sinter plants after
conducting the principal component analyses and indicatory
PCDD/F comparison (Lee et al., 2004).
Population densities (1800–3800 population km2) are lower
around the industrial than the urban sampling sites (8300 popula-
tion km2). The mean ± SD atmospheric PBDE concentrations were
165 ± 65.0 pg Nm3 in the heavy steel complex and 93.9 ± 24.5
pg Nm3 in the metals complex, 4.7 and 2.7 times higher than
those (35.3 ± 15.5 pg Nm3) in the urban areas, respectively. These
results suggest that PBDE concentrations in the atmosphere are not
closely related to the population density, which may represent the
usage levels of products containing PBDEs.
Lower atmospheric PBDE concentrations have been detected in
rural areas around theGreat Lakes in theUS (5 pg Nm3) Strandberg
et al., 2001. The levels in the urban areas (52 pg Nm3) of Chicago
(Strandberg et al., 2001) and in the suburban area (24 pg Nm3) of
Izmir, Turkey (Cetin and Odabasi, 2008) were comparable with our
ﬁndings.However, the high end of the atmospheric PBDE concentra-
tions has also been observed (medians of 514 and 382 pg Nm3 in
gaseous and particulate phases, respectively) in suburban areas of
southeastern Michigan, probably reﬂecting the urban nature of the
sites examined (Batterman et al., 2009).
After the Quantile–Quantile plots were conducted, it was found
that the both PBDE and PCDD/F concentrations in the atmosphere
have log-normal distributions. Therefore, after using the natural
logarithm transformation processes and further Pearson correla-
tion analyses, the natural logarithm of the PBDE concentrations is
signiﬁcantly correlated with the natural logarithm of PCDD/F
(r = 0.871, p < 0.001) and PCDD/F I-TEQ concentrations (r = 0.942,
p < 0.001) (see Fig. 1). This strong correlation implies that not only
these two compounds have similar environmental behavior, but
also PBDEs are from the same sources as the PCDD/Fs, that is, com-
bustion sources.
Our recent study also found that the natural logarithms of the
PBDE concentrations in the stack ﬂue gases (or exhausts) of sinter
plants, power plants and vehicles are statistically highly correlated
(r ranged from 0.481 to 0.779 and p < 0.05) with those of PCDD/F
concentrations (Wang et al., 2010b). However, non-signiﬁcant cor-
relations were found in waste incinerators, because their PBDE
emissions derive not only from formation, but also from unde-
stroyed PBDEs in the feeding materials (Wang et al., 2010b).
Similar phenomena had been found on the emission factors of
PBDEs and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans
(PBDD/Fs) of carbon steel EAFs much higher than those of stainless
steel EAFs (Wang et al., 2010c), and MSWIs with a larger percent-
age of the industrial waste exhibited higher PBDD/F and PBDE
emission factors (Wang et al., 2010a).
3.2. PBDE and PCDD/F congener proﬁles
The PCDD/F and PBDE congener proﬁles in the atmosphere of
the heavy steel complex and urban areas are illustrated in Fig. 2,
while those of metals complex areas are shown in Fig. S2 of Supple-
mentary material. The PCDD/F and PBDE congener proﬁles in the
heavy steel complex and metals complex areas are similar to each
other, but they differ from the urban proﬁles. All the PCDD/F con-
gener proﬁles show 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD, OCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-
HpCDF, and OCDF as the dominant components, consistent with
the ﬁndings of other studies (Lee et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008).
But the levels of lighter chlorinated-substituted PCDFs, such as
2,3,7,8-TeCDF, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF, and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, are more
prominent in the heavy steel complex area (12.5%) than at the ur-
ban sites (7.7%). These congeners are the indicatory PCDD/Fs of
EAFs, secondary ALSs, and sinter plants (Lee et al., 2004), revealing
metallurgical facilities are PCDD/F sources to the atmosphere of the
heavy steel complex area.
The most abundant PBDE congeners of the heavy steel complex
area are highly brominated congeners, like BDE-209, -206, -207, -
208, and -183 along with some lighter brominated congeners, like
BDE-47 and BDE-99. For the urban atmosphere, BDE-209 was still
the most abundant congener, but the fractions of BDE-47 and
BDE-99 were 2.3–4.1 times higher than those at the industrial
areas. Nevertheless, BDE-47 and BDE-99 concentrations (3.86,
3.82 pg Nm3) at these two industrial areas were higher than those

atmosphere (Wang et al., 2010b). But not like PCDD/Fs, 
comprehensive research have been conducted into their 
important sources, such as waste incinerators (Wang et al., 
2003b; Wang et al., 2007; Wang and Chang-Chien, 2007; 
Lin et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2010d), iron ore sintering 
(Wang et al., 2003c; Wang et al., 2008b), power plants 
(Lin et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2010b; Wang et al., 2010e; Wu 
et al., 2010), boilers (Chen et al., 2011), electric arc 
furnaces (EAFs) (Lee et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Li et al., 
2008; Wang et al., 2010c; Chiu et al., 2011), secondary 
aluminum smelters (ALS) (Lee et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007), 
crematories (Wang et al., 2003a), vehicles (Chuang et al., 
2010a; Chuang et al., 2010b), and the open burning of rice 
straw(Lin et al., 2007) and wood (McNamara et al., 2011). 
Furthermore, intensive studies have conducted to identify 
the formation mechanisms of PCDD/Fs that occur within 
the combustion system. Although we found the occurrence 
of PBDEs in the stack flue gases of sinter plants, revealing 
that PBDEs can form during the combustion processes 
through similar formation conditions of PCDD/Fs (Wang 
et al., 2010c), the detailed formation mechanisms of 
PBDEs still need to be clarified to be able to control PBDE 
emissions from combustion sources. 
Fly ash is typically composed of an alumina-silicate 
construct, with 20% of the weight of fly ash being carbon, 
and 5 to 10% being silicon, inorganic chlorides, sulfur and 
potassium (NATO, 1988). The particles of fly ash have 
specific surface areas in the range of 200 to 400 m2/kg 
(NATO, 1988). Furthermore, fly ash contains transition 
metal compounds and incompletely combusted products 
which are necessary for the formation of PCDD/Fs, 
PBDD/Fs, PCBs and polychlorinated diphenyl ethers 
(PCDEs) (Wang et al., 2003b; Wang et al., 2010a; Liu et 
al., 2011). The formation of PCDD/Fs which is relevant to 
the precursor mechanisms and de novo synthesis, that is, 
the interaction of chlorine, precursors, fly ashes, metal 
catalysts, and a favorable range of temperatures, have been 
well studied. The temperature is perhaps the most 
important factor in PCDD/F formation (Addink et al., 
1991). 
To the best of our knowledge, however, the formation 
mechanisms of PBDEs in the combustion system, fly ash, 
as well as their relation with temperature have never been 
investigated. Although air pollution control devices 
(APCDs), such as bag filters (Lin et al., 2008; Li et al., 
2010; Yamada et al., 2011), electrostatic precipitators (EP) 
(Ruttanachot et al., 2011), activated carbon injection (Li et 
al., 2010) and other measures (Lai et al., 2007; Wang et al., 
2008a), could be used to remove pollutants, clarifying the 
mechanisms of PBDEs may lead to methods that prevent 
their formation and their release into the environment. In 
this study, the formation mechanisms of PBDE soccurring 
in the processes of heating fly ash have been investigated 
using a laboratory furnace with graphite crucibles in order 
to clarify the effects of temperature. Two kinds of fly ash, 
raw and water-washed, are selected to conduct the 
experiments of PBDE thermal formation to clarify the 
influence of the bromide and calcium contents in the fly 
ash on PBDE formation. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Fly Ash Samples and Thermal Process 
Fly ash collected from the bag filter of a medical waste 
incinerator equipped with a dry scrubber and bag filter as air 
pollution control devices was used to investigate the 
formation mechanisms of PBDEs occurring in the processes 
of heating fly ash. The fly ash samples were put in a graphite 
crucible and placed in the furnace. The experiments were 
performed by increasing the furnace temperature by 5 
°C/min from room temperature. For water-washed fly ash, 
the heating temperature was maintained at 50, 100, 150, 200, 
250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 650, 750, 850, 900, 1000, 1100, 
1200, 1300, 1350 and 1450C, respectively, for 1 h, and then 
cooled down to room temperature naturally, while for raw 
fly ash, the heating temperature was kept at 50, 100, 150, 
200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 650, 750 and 850°C, 
respectively.  
 
Analytical Procedures of PBDEs 
The analyses of thirty PBDE congeners were performed 
following U.S. EPA Method 1614. PBDE internal 
standards were spiked to the samples before Soxhlet 
extraction with toluene, and were used to monitor the 
extraction and cleanup procedures. The detailed analytical 
procedures for PBDEs are given in our previous works 
(Wang et al., 2003a; Wang et al., 2010c). In brief, the 
concentrated extract was treated with concentrated sulfuric 
acid, and this was followed by a series of sample cleanup 
and fractionation procedures, including a multi-layered 
silica column and alumina column. The eluate was 
concentrated to approximately 1 mL and transferred to a 
vial. The concentrate was further concentrated to near 
dryness, using a stream of nitrogen. Immediately prior to 
analysis, the standard solution for recovery checking was 
added to the sample. 
 
Instrumental Analysis of PBDEs 
A high-resolution gas chromatograph/high-resolution 
mass spectrometer (HRGC/HRMS) was used for PBDE 
analyses. The HRGC (Hewlett-Packard 6970 Series gas 
chromatograph, CA) was equipped with a DB-5HT 
capillary column (L = 15 m, i.d. = 0.25 mm, film thickness 
= 0.1 μm) (J&W Scientific, CA), and with a splitless 
injection (injector at 250°C, transfer glass line at 280°C). 
The injection volume was 2 μL. The column oven 
temperature program was set according to the following 
parameters: initial oven temperature began at 100°C (held 
for 4 min), then increased at 40 °C/min to 200°C (held for 
3.5 min), and finally increased at 10°C/min to 325°C (held 
for 2.5 min). Helium ata flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was the 
carrier gas. The HRMS (Micromass Autospec Ultima, 
Manchester, UK) mass spectrometer was equipped with a 
positive electron impact (EI+) source. The selected ion 
monitoring mode was used with a resolving power of 
10,000. Detailed instrumental analysis parameters of the 
PBDEs are given in our previous work (Wang and 
Chang-Chien, 2007; Wang et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 
2010c).

in liquid to solid (L/S) ratio or washing frequency. 
However, those of insoluble chlorides decrease slower 
(Zhu et al., 2010). 
 
Thermal Formation of PBDEs Occurring in the 
Water-Washed Fly Ash 
The trends of the PBDE homologue contents in the 
water-washed fly ash under various heating temperatures 
are illustrated in Fig. 2(a), while those of Σ2-8 BDE (the 
summation of di-BDE to octa-BDE contents), nona-BDE 
and deca-BDE (BDE-209) at five different temperature 
ranges of < 300°C, 400°C, 500°C–600°C, 650°C–850°C 
and > 900°C are shown in Fig. 2(b). Furthermore, Fig. 2(c) 
compares the trends of the ratios of the PBDE contents in 
the heated water-washed fly ash to those of the unheated 
one. The total PBDE contents in the heated water-washed 
fly ash were between 0.184–0.296 ng/g within alow 
temperature range (50°C–300°C), close to that of unheated 
water-washed fly ash (0.188 ng/g).  
A dramatic increase in total PBDE content in the heated 
water-washed fly ash (3.33 ng/g) occurred, 17.7 times 
higher than that of the unheated one, when the heating 
temperature reached 400°C (Fig. 2). Only a few studies 
have also observed PBDE formation during combustion 
system (Wang et al., 2010a). Our previous study found that 
when the flue gases of municipal solid waste incinerators 
(MSWIs) flowed from the superheaters to the economizers, 
the PCDD/F contents in the ashes of the economizers 
whose the operational temperatures (339°C–396°C) were 
within the region of optimal PCDD/F formation were much 
higher than those in the ashes of the superheater whose 
temperatures (480°C–537°C) were not favorable for 
PCDD/F formation. The PBDD/F and PBDE contents in 
the ashes of the economizers were also six times higher 
than those in the ashes of the superheater, suggesting that 
de novo syntheses could also occur among PBDD/Fs and 
PBDEs (Wang et al., 2010a). 
We speculate that at this temperature range the PBDE 
formation pathway is similar to the de novo synthesis of 
PCDD/Fs, that is, PBDEs form the oxidative breakdown of 
macromolecular carbon structures of fly ash catalyzed by a 
transition metal in the presence of bromine. PBDEs are

CONCLUSIONS 
 
The trends of PBDE thermal formation in the heated 
water-washed and raw fly ash are basically similar. Both 
see PBDE formations at heating temperatures of 400°C and 
650–850°C, and the most significant difference is that the 
water-washed fly ash possessed much greater PBDE 
formation potential, due to its most removal of alkaline 
compounds which are inhibitors for the formation of 
precursors and PBDEs. 
At a heating temperature of 400°C, deca-BDE has the 
greatest formation compared to other PBDE congeners, and 
this has also been observed in the formation of PCDEs 
when fly ash contains FeCl3 and CuCl2. At temperatures of 
650–850°C, we speculate that enormous amounts of 
brominated aromatic precursors are formed in fly ash 
catalyzed heterogeneous reactions, resulting in another 
dramatic increase in PBDE contents through de novo 
synthesis and precursor mechanisms when the temperature 
slowly falls to 400°C.

are serious issues in many countries. In the past, many 
studies focused on the PCDD/F emissions from various 
sources, such as waste incinerators (Wang et al., 2003b; 
Wang et al., 2007; Wang and Chang-Chien, 2007; Lin et 
al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2010d), iron ore sintering (Wang et 
al., 2003c; Kuo et al., 2011), power plants (Lin et al., 2007; 
Lin et al., 2010b; Wang et al., 2010e; Wu et al., 2010), 
boilers (Chen et al., 2011), electric arc furnaces (EAFs) 
(Lee et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Wang et 
al., 2010c; Chiu et al., 2011), secondary aluminum smelters 
(ALS) (Lee et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007), crematories 
(Wang et al., 2003a), and the open burning of rice straw 
(Lin et al., 2007) and wood (McNamara et al., 2011). 
However, mobile sources are almost as important as 
stationary sources in the contribution to PCDD/F emissions 
(Chuang et al., 2010a; Chuang et al., 2010b), and the 
relative contribution fraction of PCDD/Fs from mobile 
sources has gradually risen in many countries since the 
execution of more stringent PCDD/F emission standards 
for stationary sources.  
We recently found that PBDEs can form during the 
combustion processes through similar formation conditions 
as PCDD/Fs (Wang et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2010b; 
Wang et al., 2010c; Artha et al., 2011). The GM PBDE 
concentrations measured from the exhaust of UGFVs and 
DFVs were 46.7 ng/Nm3, and 29.1 ng/Nm3, respectively 
(Wang et al., 2010b), and the highly brominated PBDEs in 
urban ambient air were contributed by combustion sources, 
such as vehicles (Wang et al., 2010b, 2011). 
Air pollution control devices (APCDs), such as bag 
filters (Lin et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 
2011), electrostatic precipitators (EP) (Ruttanachot et al., 
2011), activated carbon injection (Li et al., 2010) and other 
measures (Lai et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008a), are used to 
remove pollutants from stack flue gases of stationary 
emission sources. Diesel particulate matter has been 
identified as a toxic air contaminant (Wenger et al., 2008), 
and diesel particulate filters (DPFs) are widely-used 
devices which can decrease the PM from diesel engine 
exhausts by up to 90%. Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), 
which are commonly used in combination with a DPF, 
have been used to oxidize total hydrocarbon and carbon 
monoxide to water and carbon dioxide.  
Heavy-duty diesel vehicles emit potentially harmful and 
unregulated toxic pollutants to the atmosphere, such as 
PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PBDEs (Wenger et al., 2008; 
Wang et al., 2010b, 2011;). In this study, an analytical 
method was developed to simultaneously measure several 
pollutants, including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PBDEs, 
from one exhaust sample. The emission characteristics of 
the above toxic pollutants from heavy-duty diesel vehicles 
were investigated in this study, except for PAHs, which 
will be discussed in another work. Furthermore, the 
reduction of toxic pollutants by deploying three kinds of 
DPF as pollution control devices was evaluated to clarify 
their removal. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Vehicles and DPF 
The engine volume, mileage, manufacturing year, and 
the types of DPF of the tested vehicles are listed in Table 1. 
The manufacturing years of the vehicles ranged from 1997 
to 2003, and the mileage were from 73000 to 145000 km. 
Three types of DPF were deployed in these vehicles, 
including a mobile metal filter plus catalyzed diesel 
particulate filter (MMF+CDPF) for vehicles A and B, DOC 
+ CDPF for vehicles C – F, and a partial diesel particulate 
filter (PDPF) for vehicle G.  
 
Sampling Procedures 
The tested vehicles were maintained at 60 km/h for 10 
minutes on a standard chassis dynamometer. Exhausts of 
the heavy-duty diesel vehicles (vehicular tailpipes) were 
directly sampled with constant flow rate at 30 L/min using 
U.S. EPA Modified Method 5 sampling trains before and 
after deploying the DPF as a pollution control device. 
Gaseous and particulate phase toxic pollutants were 
collected by XAD-2 resins and quartz fiber filters, 
respectively. The sampled flue gas volumes were 
normalized to the dry condition of 760 mmHg and 273 K, 
and denoted as Nm3. 
 
Analytical Procedures 
The quartz fiber filter and XAD-2 resin of each exhaust 
sample were combined for analysis to represent a whole 
exhaust sample. Samples were analyzed for sixteen PAHs, 
seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F, twelve dioxin-like 
PCBs and thirty PBDE congeners. PBDE, PCB and 
PCDD/F analyses were performed following the U.S. EPA 
Method 1614, Modified Method 1668A, and Modified 
Method 23, respectively. PAHs, PCBs, PCDD/Fs and

The PCB concentrations in the exhausts of the tested 
heavy-duty diesel vehicles before installing DPF ranged 
from 0.0727 to 2.86 pg WHO-TEQ/Nm3, while for PBDEs 
they were from 12.0 to 385 ng/Nm3. Similar to PCDD/Fs, 
vehicles with greater mileage had higher PCB and PBDE 
concentrations in their exhausts. The PCB concentrations 
emitted from vehicles B, C and G were 1.29, 1.66 and 2.86 
pg WHO-TEQ/Nm3, while for PBDEs, their concentrations 
were 192, 31.0 and 385 ng/Nm3. 
 
PCDD/F, PCB and PBDE Congener Profiles in the 
Vehicular Exhaust before Installing DPF 
The PCDD/F, PCB and PBDE congener profiles in the 
vehicular exhaust before installing DPFs are illustrated in 
Fig. 1. The exhaust of these tested vehicles contained an 
abundance of highly chlorinated-substituted congeners, like 
OCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF and 
OCDF, as seen in the results of our previous work (Wang 
et al., 2010b), and for unleaded gas-fueled vehicles and 
diesel-fueled vehicles (DFLs) in the USEPA’s database for 
mobile sources (U.S. EPA, 2006). The identical distribution 
of PCDD/F congeners for gasoline and diesel passenger 
cars suggests that the difference in fuels and engine types 
did not result in significant variations in the PCDD/F 
congener profile.  
For the PCB congener profiles in the exhaust, PCB-118, 
-156, -105 and -167 are the major congeners. For PBDEs, 
the dominant PBDE congeners are highly brominated- 
substituted ones, including BDE-209, -208, -207, and -206. 
Among the low to medium brominated congeners, BDE-47 
and BDE-99 are more dominant. Unlike the EAFs and 
secondary ALSs, there are no raw materials containing 
PBDEs fed into the combustion systems of HDDVs. 
Consequently, the relatively higher fractions of highly 
brominated substituents compared to EAFs and secondary 
ALSs reveal that the PBDE formation during the 
combustion process prefers highly brominated congeners.  
 
Reduction of the Toxic Pollutants by DPFs 
Reductions of PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PBDEs emitted from 
HDDVs by deploying three kinds of DPFs as pollution 
control devices are listed in Table 5. The estimated 
reductions of PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PBDEs by DPFs are 
calculated as follows.  
 
Reduction efficiency (%) = (A – B)/A ×100%, (1) 
 
where A is the concentration of the toxic pollution emitted 
from HDDVs before deploying a DPF, and B is the 
concentration of the toxic pollution after deploying one.  
For MMF + CDPF, the reduction in PBDEs (67.9%– 
80.5%) is higher than that of PCDD/Fs and PCBs, which 
actually showed a negative reduction, that is, there was 
more formation of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. This could be due 
to the de novo and precursor formations of PCDD/Fs and 
PCBs resulting from the combined effects of the 
accumulated particulate in the DPFs, favorable temperature 
and longer retention time for the exhaust.  
Among these three types of DPFs, PDPF exhibited the 
largest reduction in these toxic pollutants emitted from 
HDDVs, which reached 83.9%–95.3% on mass basis, and 
54.2%–71.9% on toxicity basis. Generally speaking, the 
reduction of these toxic pollutants by DOC + CDPF is 
higher than by MMF + CDPF. In the trial of vehicles D + E, 
the reduction of these toxic pollutants ranged from 56.1% 
(mass of PCDD/Fs) to 80.1% (mass of PBDEs). Wenger et 
al. (2008) investigated the AhR mediated activity of the 
exhaust generated by a heavy-duty diesel engine. AhR 
agonists were quantified using the DR-CALUX reporter 
gene assay. They found 54–60 ng 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin CALUX equivalents 
(TCDD-CEQs) per m3 of exhaust in unfiltered samples, 
and 6–16 ng TCDD-CEQ/m3 in DPF treated samples. DPF 
thus decreased the TCDD-CEQ concentrations by almost 
90%.  
Significant differences existed between the trials, 
revealing that the influential factors on the reduction of 
these toxic pollutants could be more complex than those 
for the reduction of particulate matter. We speculate that 
the most influential factors that need to be considered 
concerning the reduction of these toxic pollutants by DPF 
are the existence of these in both particulate and gaseous 
phases, as well as the formation of these pollutants inside 
the DPF.  
The reductions in PBDEs by these three types of DPFs 
are generally higher than those of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. 
This could be attributed to the weaker binding energy of 
C-Br compared to C-Cl (Weber and Kuch, 2003), and the 
different formation mechanisms of these pollutants.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Before DPF were installed in these vehicles, the PCDD/F 
and PCB concentrations in the exhaust of these tested 
heavy-duty diesel vehicles ranged from 0.983 to 22.3 pg 
I-TEQ/Nm3, and from 0.0727 to 2.86 pg WHO-TEQ/Nm3, 
respectively. Vehicles with greater mileage had higher 
PCDD/Fs, PCB and PBDE concentrations in the exhaust. 
After the tested vehicles were equipped with DPFs, some 
trials showed the formation of PCDD/Fs and PCBs

occurring inside the DPF, resulting from the de novo and

in these toxic pollutants emitted from HDDVs among the 
three DPFs, and the reduction reached 83.9%–95.3% on 
mass basis, and 54.2%–71.9% on toxicity basis. However, 
significant differences existed between the trials of the 
three DPFs. We speculate that the most influential factors 
that need to be considered concerning the reduction of 
these toxic pollutants by DPF are their existence in both 
particulate and gaseous phases, as well as their formation 
inside the DPF. The reductions of PBDEs by these three 
types of DPFs are generally higher than those of PCDD/Fs 
and PCBs. This phenomena could be attributed to the 
weaker binding energy of C-Br compared to C-Cl, and the 
different formation mechanisms among these pollutants.
