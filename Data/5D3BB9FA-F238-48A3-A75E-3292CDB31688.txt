literature to investigate the problem of 
spillover suppression to avoid instability. 
    In flexible mechanical systems, the 
system parameters are often subject to 
parameter uncertainties due to inaccuracies in 
the calculations of the frequencies and 
damping due to approximations in the 
structural model, material properties, mass, 
damping, and so forth. These parameter 
uncertainties can degrade the system 
performance, and it is sometimes possible to 
destabilize the system (Lin et al., 1990; Khot 
and Heise, 1994). Recently, many articles (Lin 
et al., 1990; Khot and Heise, 1994; Khot and 
Oz, 1997; Chou et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2000; 
Chen, 2003; and refernce therein) have 
addressed the active vibration control problem 
of flexible mechanical systems under both 
residual modes and linear structured parameter 
uncertainties. Note that the results proposed 
by Lin et al. (1990), Chou et al. (1998), Chen 
et al. (2000) and Chen (2003) are valid for 
linear time-varying structured parameter 
uncertainties, whereas the results given by 
Khot and Heise (1994) and Khot and Oz (1997) 
are applicable only to linear time-invariant 
structured parameter uncertainties. It is well 
known that any analysis used for the 
time-varying case can be specified to the 
time-invariant case (but not vice versa). That 
is, the results of Lin et al. (1990), Chou et al. 
(1998), Chen et al. (2000) and Chen (2003) 
are valid for both the time-invariant case and 
the time-varying case. Besides, because it is 
impossible in practice to precisely implement 
the active control law, it is reasonable to 
consider the perturbations exist in the 
feedback gain and estimator gain. In addition, 
a multivariable feedback control system may 
become unstable when the feedback signals 
are switched off by a failure in the actuators or 
the sensors. The system possessing integrity 
means that the system still remains 
asymptotically stable in the presence of such 
failures (Huang and Chang, 1998). Till now, 
to the authors’ best knowledge, the problem of 
stability robustness of the flexible mechanical 
systems under mode truncation, linear 
time-varying parameter uncertainties in both 
controlled and residual parts, feedback gain 
perturbations, estimator gain perturbations and 
partial actuator failures has not been discussed 
in the literature yet. 
 On the other hand, only robust stability 
is often not enough in control system design. 
The quadratic optimal performance is also 
considered in many practical control 
engineering applications. Hence, the 
robust-optimal active vibration control designs 
are needed for robust stability and 
performance design for flexible mechanical 
systems under mode truncation, linear 
time-varying structured parameter 
uncertainties, feedback gain perturbations, 
estimator gain perturbations and partial 
actuator failures. The robust-optimal active 
vibration control design is to find a stabilizing 
controller and observer that minimize an  
performance index (i.e., the integral of the 
squared error (ISE) or the integral of the 
time-weighted squared error (ITSE)) subjects 
to the stability robustness inequality constraint. 
Therefore, the purpose of this report is to use 
the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) 
for finding the active vibration controllers of 
the flexible mechanical systems with linear 
time-varying structured parameter 
uncertainties in both controlled and residual 
parts, feedback gain matrix perturbations, 
estimator gain matrix perturbations and partial 
actuator failures such that the control objective 
of minimizing an  performance index 
subject to the stability robustness constraint is 
achieved.

having the equations (5a)-(5c), the actual

are not known, but their values are constrained 
to lie within known compact bounding sets. 
We assume that these perturbation matrices 
are bounded by the following inequalities:

and

in which , , , ,  and  are 
given non-negative constant matrices and 
represent the structured information.

To model the possible actuator failures, a 
“switching matrix” is defined as:  
),,,( 21 Mrs llldiagL L=       (11) 
where  ( ) can be any value in [0, 
1]. The matrix  is placed between 
controller and actuator. Thus, we have a model 
of failures at the actuator chennels:

is “open” as a result of the corresponding 
actuator failure, while  represents the 
normal situation of the i-th channel. In this 
report, we consider the case of partial actuator 
failures, i.e., all ’s are not zero. Now 
consider an observer-based controller, which 
is designed on the basis of the controlled part, 
of the form

cKΔ  and cFΔ  are, respectively, the 
estimator gain matrix perturbation and 
feedback gain matrix perturbation. Because it 
is impossible in practice to precisely 
implement this control law, it is reasonable to 
assume that the estimator gain matrix and 
feedback gain matrix actually read cc KK Δ+  
and cc FF Δ+ , respectively, where cKΔ  and 
cFΔ  are additive uncertain terms.  
    Combining equations (7)-(9), (12) and 
(13), the actual closed-loop vibration control 
system of the flexible mechanical system is 
given by the following composite matrix form:

    From equation (14), we can see that the

Design Example: 
     Consider the same flexible rotor 
example as that adopted by Nonami et al. 
(1992), where two pairs of collocated 
actuators and displacement sensors are used. 
In this example, we assume 4=L . That is, we 
use a finite-dimensional model having 4 
modes to approximate the original 
infinite-dimensional flexible rotor system. The 
first and second modes are treated as 
controlled modes, and the third mode is 
treated as residual mode.  These frequencies 
of the rotor are , , , and  
rad/sec, respectively. Using the formulas and 
modal analysis, we can obtain the state space 
model for this flexible rotor as following

The responses of displacements and control 
forces for the uncertain flexible rotor control 
system with the designed active vibration 
controller subject to desired output 0)( =tyd  
under time-varying structured parameter 
uncertainties and different actuator failures are, 
respectively, shown in Figures 1-7. From 
Figures 1-7, it can be seen that the vibration is 
remarkably suppressed by employing control 
signals, and the robust stabilizing property is 
also achieved. Hence, we could conclude that 
the HTGA approach can obtain satisfactory 
results. 
 
四、結論與討論 
     This report has investigated the 
robust-optimal active vibration controller 
design problem of flexible mechanical systems 
under mode truncation, linear time-varying 
parameter uncertainties, controller parameter 
perturbations and parital actuator failures. A 
sufficient condition is proposed to ensure that 
the flexible mechanical systems with 
time-varying structured parameter 
uncertainties are asymptotically stable against 
partial actuator failures. Based on the robust 
stability constraint and the minimization of a 
defined  performance index, a hybrid 
Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is applied 
to solve the optimal state feedback controller 
and observer design problem of uncertain 
flexible mechanical systems. A design 
example of a flexible rotor system is given to 
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 
approach. The designed robust-optimal active 
vibration controller by using the HTGA 
approach not only can significantly suppress 
the vibration of the flexible rotor system, but 
also can avoid the possibilities of instability 
induced by spillover, time-varying structured 
parameter uncertainties, controller parameter 
perturbations and partial actuator failures.
