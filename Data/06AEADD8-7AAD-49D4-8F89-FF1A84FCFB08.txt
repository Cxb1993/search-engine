certain conditions, no experimental proof was 
provided to support this prediction.   
In this paper we demonstrate, both 
theoretically and experimentally, the 
coexistence of more than one stable non-
axisymmetric configuration when a clamped-
free disk deforms under its own weight. Von 
Karman’s plate model is adopted to derive the 
equations of motion of a rotating heavy disk. A 
nonlinear Galerkin’s method based on two sets 
of assumed functions is used to solve the 
equilibrium equations. A vibration method is 
used to determine the stability of the calculated 
deformations. For a stationary disk, we are 
interested in the variation of the disk 
deformation and its natural frequencies as the 
external force (gravity) varies. For a rotating 
disk, we will focus on how the stable non-
axisymmetric deformations evolve as the 
rotation speed changes. Experiments on a 415 -
inch floppy disk are conducted to verify the 
theoretical predictions on the behaviours of the 
stationary and rotating disks. 
       
2. Equations of motion 
 According to von Karman’s plate model 
(Nowinski, 1964; Chen 2011), the equations of 
motion of a rotating disk under its own weight, 
in terms of transverse displacement w and stress 
function φ  can be written as, ( )++=∇+ −− θθφφρ ,2,1,4, rrwwDhw rrrtt  ( ) ( ) ( )

The parameters h, ρ , E, ν , D, and Ω  are the 
thickness, mass density, Young’s modulus, 
Poisson ratio, flexural rigidity, and the rotation 
speed of the disk, respectively. g is the 
gravitational acceleration. ( , )r θ  are polar 
coordinates relative to a disk-fixed frame. w is 
the transverse displacement measured from the 
clamping plane, and is positive when it is 
opposite to the direction of the gravitational 
force. The disk is flat and stress free when the 
gravity is absent. The disk is assumed to be 
fully clamped at the inner radius r =a and free 
at the outer radius b. 
The above equations can be non-
dimensionalized by introducing the following

Galerkin’s method based on two sets of

solutions. 
 
3. Numerical results and experimental 
observations 
3.1 Stationary disk 
3.1.1 Theory 
We first consider the case when the disk 
is not rotating. Fig. 1 shows the theoretical 
relation between the maximum deflection on the 
outer radius ( )1 maxrw =  and the external load 
(gravity) q for a disk with radius ratio η =0.3. 
The number of modes used in the calculation 
are chosen to be M=3 and N=8, which shows 
satisfactory convergence. The solid and dashed 
lines represent stable and unstable solutions, 
respectively. For clamping radius η =0.3, Fig. 1 
shows that the circular plate deforms 
axisymmetrically when the load q is small. As q

Sometimes a shock on the workbench switched 
the deformation from one to the other. For this 
particular specimen, the probabilities to observe 
either of these two deformations are about the 
same.  
 
3.2 Rotating disk 
3.2.1 Theory 
 We next consider the effect of the 
rotation speed Ω . The gravity q is set at 1155. 
Fig. 4 shows the theoretical relations between 
the maximum deflections on the outer radius ( )1 maxrw =  and Ω . Solid and dashed lines 
represent stable and unstable deformations, 
respectively. Attention is placed on the two 
stable equilibrium configurations of shapes 
cos2θ  and cos3θ  as they evolve when Ω  
increases from 0.  
 We first observe that the stable cos2θ -
solution merges with a mixed mode and 
becomes unstable when  Ω  reaches 2.23, 
denoted (1)crΩ .  The  originally unstable cos4θ -
solution bifurcates at Ω =2.41, denoted (2)crΩ , 
and becomes stable. Two additional unstable 
mixed solutions emerge from this bifurcation.  
These two unstable mixed solutions merge with 
the original stable cos3θ -solution (see the inset 
for detail) at Ω =11.63, denoted (3)crΩ . 
Following this merging, the emerging  cos3θ -
solution becomes unstable. The stable cos4θ -
solution merges with the originally unstable 
axisymmetric solution at Ω =12.72, denoted 
(4)
crΩ . Following this bifurcation, the 
axisymmetric solution emerges and remains 
stable thereafter. Starting from Ω =12.72 the 
axisymmetric defomation appears to be the only 
stable configuration left in the diagram. 
 The above analysis predicts an 
interesting and somewhat unexpected scenario 
as the heavy disk rotates. The initially stable 
non-axisymmetric solutions not only are 
flattened out due to centrifugal stretching, they 
may also jump to other non-axisymmetric 
solutions. For instance, if the disk starts out 
with cos2θ -deformation, it may jump to 
cos3θ - or cos4θ -deformation when Ω  is 
increased slowly to 2.23. On the other hand, if 
the disk starts out with cos3θ -deformation, it 
will jump to cos4θ -deformation when Ω  
reaches 11.63. Although eventually the 
axisymmetric deformation is the only stable 
configuration remaining when the rotation 
speed is high enough, the evolution of the 
deformation due to increasing rotation speed is 
not as straightforward as we might have 
expected.  For the specimen we have at hand, 
Ω =12.72 is equivalent to1284 rpm. 
 
3.2.2 Experiment 
 The above theoretical predictions on the 
evolution of steady state deformation as rotation 
speed varies were examined experimentally. 
The clamped-free disk was mounted on a dc 
motor, whose speed can be controlled 
accurately. The rotation speed was varied 
slowly to ensure that steady state was reached. 
A space-fixed laser displacement sensor was 
aimed normal to the disk surface near the outer 
rim to measure the disk shape. It is noted that 
the specimen used in the rotating disk 
experiment is not the same one as in the 
stationary disk experiment, which tends to be 
damaged following intensive impacts for the 
power spectrums. However, they are from the 
same batch.  
 We first started with the disk shape 
cos2θ . Fig. 5(a) shows the waveform and its 
Fourier transform when the disk rotated slowly 
at 60 rpm (Ω =0.6). It is confirmed that the disk 
waveform contains mainly the 2Ω  component. 
Fig. 5(b) shows that when Ω =3, the 3Ω  
component became the dominant component in 
the waveform. This switch of cos2θ  to cos3θ -
shape agrees with the theoretical prediction. The 
dominance of the 3Ω  component can be 
observed all the way until Ω =10. When Ω  
increased to 10, as shown in Fig. 5(c), the 
magnitude of the higher modes, including 2Ω , 
3Ω , and 4Ω , are very small compared to the 
original 2Ω  component in Fig. 5(a) (about only 
1%). This deformation persisted until Ω =13 
and may be considered as axisymmetric. Fig. 
5(d) shows a long-period waveform when 
Ω =13. It is noted that at this speed, steady state 
deformation of the rotating disk was no longer 
achievable. In the Fourier transform, there
