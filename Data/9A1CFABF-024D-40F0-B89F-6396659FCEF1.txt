substrates, simple processing steps that potentially low cost, 
low elastic modulus which is flexible and deposition by 
printing process that could be produced in large area.  
The consumer product such as flexible display, radio 
frequency identification tag (RFID), smart card, polymer 
solar cell and polymer sensors are therefore 
demonstrated.[1−5] Among all products, the organic thin 
film transistor (OTFT) has no doubt the most important 
device. They are used not only as the logic circuit in sensor, 
RFID and smart card but also the addressing and current 
source components in flexible display.[31] 
Although many efforts has been done to improve the 
properties of OTFTs, there are still some issues to be 
explored.[6−8] Main challenge is the controlling properties 
of the organic dielectric [9,10] which is printed in large 
area for low voltage OTFTs. The low voltage is essential 
for OTFTs since the above-mentioned applications are 
portable products that have very limit energy capacity. 
Low driving voltage could save the usage of the electrical 
power. Another is printing in large area with controlled 
properties. Either logic circuit or the active addressing 
circuit all need very uniform performance for OTFTs. 
Very less thickness or interface properties variation could 
make those circuits unstable or even fail. For these 
requirements, the dielectric layer of OTFT must be well 
controlled and has high uniformity over the large area by 
printing process such as inkjet printing, slot coating, doctor 
blade and many other printing methods.  
One of the key factor that determine the driving 
voltage of a thin film transistor was the capacitance of the 
gate dielectric layer by the following simple equation. 
VCQ ich ×=           (1)                                                                            
Where the Qch is the carrier density for channel, Ci is 
the density of the gate capacitance and V is the driving 
voltage. The density of capacitance can be further 
expressed as follow.

εε=             (2)                          
Where εo is permittivity of free space, εr is dielectric 
constant of the organic insulator, and t is the thickness of 
dielectric. Therefore, by Equation (1), low driving voltage 
requires high gate capacitance. To get high capacitance for 
gate dielectric, by Equation (2), there are two directions. 
One is adopting high dielectric constant material another is 
utilizing ultra-thin dielectric. High dielectric constant 
metal oxides such as HfO2, Y2O3, Ta2O5, TiO2 and Al2O3 
[19−23] are not only popular for Si technology but also for 
the OTFTs. The metal oxides generally exhibit hydrophilic 
surface, higher roughness and fixed oxide charge in the 
dielectric layer. In addition, the metal oxides could not 
deposited well by printing process in large area. However, 
the surface energy of gate dielectric affects the 
morphology of organic semiconductor much, both small 
molecular and polymer organic semiconductor such as 
pentacene and polythiophene tends to form better film 
structure on hydrophobic surface which exhibit higher 
mobility and better interface. [11,12] Besides the dielectric 
morphology, the roughness of the dielectric surface also 
significantly influences the carrier transport mobility of 
OTFT [13,14] since the carriers scatter with the interface 
roughness will slow down the carrier transport velocity 
yield low mobility. These imply the high dielectric 
constant metal oxides are not adequate material for high 
quality and low voltage OTFTs in current situation even 
hybrid organic/inorganic material are used for higher 
mobility and better interfaces. [24,25]  
To have ultra-thin, robust and hydrophobic gate 
dielectric, techniques of self assemble monolayer (SAM),

3.  Results and discussion 
3.1  Physical properties of the PS-r-PMMA copolymer 
Figure 1a shows the schematic concept of the 
PS-r-PMMA thin film for large area application. While the 
PS-r-PMMA solution was casted on the native oxide layer, 
the copolymer chains stack with each other and distribute 
randomly in about 3µm thick.  After anneal the 
PS-r-PMMA at the temperature above glass transition 
temperature (Tg) of both PS and PMMA in oxygen-free 
and humidity-free environment, the small amount of 
hydroxyl groups (OH-) produced during copolymer 
synthesis process will diffuse and react with the native 
oxide surface to from an chemical bonding.[26] The 
un-bounded PS-r-PMMA random copolymer chains are 
removable by toluene to form an ultra-thin and uniform 
dielectric film. Figure 1b shows the evolution of 
PS-r-PMMA thin film observed by an optical microscopic. 
The drop-casted PS-r-PMMA solution was spread well 
over the entire Si substrate. After thermal annealing, the 
toluene evaporates and leaves a very rough PS-r-PMMA 
surface with irregular cavities that is a typical case in a 
large area printing process for dielectric films. After rinsed 
by toluene, the irregular cavities and mounts were removed, 
obtaining a remarkable smooth surface of PS-r-PMMA 
film.  
For further microscopic confirmation, Fig. 2a shows 
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of 
PS-r-PMMA film without toluene rinse in which many 
mounds and cavities were found. In contrast, after rinsed 
by toluene for 30s, large numbers of unattached 
PS-r-PMMA chains were taken away that mounds and 
cavities were removed as shown in Fig. 2b..  The 
uniformity was significantly improved over the entire 
sample. After rinsed in toluene, the thickness of the 
PS-r-PMMA film determined by the ellipsometer was 
reduced to nanometer regime. Figure 2c and 2d shows the 
topography image by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for 
the original and rinsed PS-r-PMMA film, respectively in 
small scale. After rinse in toluene, much smooth 
PS-r-PMMA surface was found. Follow by the optical 
microscopy, SEM image and AFM topography 
measurement, the toluene rinsed PS-r-PMMA film shows 
flat surface from macroscopic to microscopic. For the flat 
surface, it implies the possibility to grow better organic 
semiconductor. Figure 2e and 2f show the morphology of 
40nm thick pentacene evaporated on the original and 
rinsed PS-r-PMMA. Larger grains were found on flat 
PS-r-PMMA surface. 
In addition to the smooth surface, the brush thickness 
of PS-r-PMMA can also be controlled. Figure 3a shows the 
relationship between the thickness and annealing 
conditions. Below 150°C, the PS-PMMA film thickness 
were kept around 2-3 nm. At higher temperature, the 
thickness increases rapidly in the first 10 hours and then 
kept around. The thickness of 10~14 nm and 6~8 nm were 
obtained for 190°C and 170°C annealed sample, 
respectively. This saturation in thickness can be explained 
by the following mechanism. The attached polymer chains 
will stretch to provide a high entropic barrier restricting the 
further adhesion of supplementary chains upon thermal 
annealing.[26] However, as the temperature increased 
further, sufficient thermal energy probably enhance the 
diffusion ability that overcome the entropic barrier to 
attach on the hydrophilic oxide surface. Figure 3b and 3c 
shows the schematic diagram for the PS-r-PMMA chain 
attachment on the oxide surface at low and high 
temperature, respectively. At low temperature, the thermal 
energy is not high enough to exceed entropic barrier for the 
 8
current at 5V was obtained. And not surprise, the OTFT 
with original PS-r-PMMA require a voltage as high as 40V 
to operate.  
The performance comparison with various annealed 
PS-r-PMMA are listed in Table 1. It is noteworthy that 
improvement of the subthreshold swing of OTFT with 
ultra-thin PS-r-PMMA as the gate dielectric. The surface is 
more regular for the ultra-thin PS-r-PMMA dielectric after 
toluene rinse than the original random coated PS-r-PMMA 
dielectric layer. Such a regular arrangement of chain 
performs a smooth surface for pentacene growth with less 
interface traps and increases the mobility.  
 
4. Conclusions 
    In summary, we have demonstrated that the 
random copolymer such as PS-r-PMMA could be a 
printable gate dielectric for printed organic thin film 
transistor. The print capability is evaluated by the casting, 
annealing and removing procedure which is compatible to 
ink-jet printing, slot-coating, screen printing, doctor blade 
and many other printing methods. The developed dielectric 
also exhibit a self-limited behavior in thickness which is 
controlled by thermal annealing. For the electrical 
properties, this reandom copolymer achieved well 
properties in low leakage current (~10-9 A/cm2), smooth 
mophology and high capacitance density (~150 nF/cm2). 
By applying this random copolymer to an OTFT as the 
gate dielectric, a small operation voltage as low as 5V was 
obtained whih is comparable to the real electronics in the 
VLSI technology of 1μm technology node. In addition to 
5V operation, the PS-r-PMMA based OTFT exhibit 
subthreshold swing of 0.29 V/dec, threshold voltage of 
-1.9V, Ion/Ioff ratio of 104 and mobility of 0.14 cm2V−1s−1 at 
process temperature of 150°C. Such a random copolymer 
dielectric is therefore very suitable for OTFT in large area 
printed flexible electronic applications.
