中文摘要 
   本份報告分成四個部分，每個部份介紹本實驗室團隊研
究的不同的主題與成果。第一部分，我們將介紹 MAC 層的垂
直換手機制。第二部分的內容將闡述我們所提出的媒體控制
連階層(MAC)嶄新驗證方法與其實現。而第三部分將著重在
3GPP LTE 規格下的媒體接取控制層(MAC)的無線資源管理研
究。第四部分，我們將介紹一種計算媒體接取控制層封包長
度的計算法，來避免過度的重傳。以下就各細項做說明。 
 在系統設計上，垂直換手機制(VHO)對於異質網路的影響
很大。傳統上是利用 SINR 以及頻道的可利用性來做為決策
的條件。但是傳統的決策機制仍有可能造成錯誤的決策。因
為好的 SINR 並不代表好的產量效能(Throughput)，為了避
免此種問題的發生，本篇報告提出以有效 SINR (effective 
SINR)來計算可完成的資料率。另外， MAC 層的系統驗證通
常是通過預設儲存的資料做分解重組，並未考慮到真實交通
流量的情形。而軟體層模擬的缺點是只能看到數據，而無法
看見多媒體的實際運作效果。因此，為了驗證與模擬通訊 MAC
系統並增加分析的精準度，本報告透過引入新的系統驗證方
法(MAC 擬真系統的設計)來達到降低設計複雜度與開發周期
的目的。 而在本報告第三部分所要探討的主題裡，主要是
針對解決超微細胞(或者是說家用基地台)中訊號干擾的問
題做探討。並建構一個以軟體實現的實驗性模擬系統，藉此
可以協助標準活動的參與、相關的智慧財產權佈局與使用該
實驗性模擬系統做系統設計之先期驗證，以利產品研發。而
我們的研究工作主要是針對 3GPP LTE 的標準，設計干擾管
理的技術。由於超微細胞基地台為新興技術，如何與大型基 
 
地台及其他極微細胞基地台做有效的資源分配及管理並降
低干擾為重要的議題。 
  最後，我們將探討與封包傳輸有關的重要問題。在傳輸系
統中，封包切割大小的適當與否，將會決定傳輸的品質。如
果封包切割的不恰當，便會經常造成封包錯誤的產生。因此
如何將封包切割成適當大小來維持好的服務品質是相當重
要的。

Abstract — This report contains four parts with different 
topics. In the first part, we introduce the vertical handover 
mechanism in the MAC layer. The second part is mainly 
about a new verification method of the MAC layer and its 
realization. The third part is about the resource 
management in 3GPP LTE system. And finally, in the 
fourth part, we will discuss a method to calculate the 
payload length of the MAC layer packet, which will improve 
the system performance. Details of each part are discussed 
as follows. 
The vertical handover mechanism (VHO) affects the 
heterogeneous networking environments a lot. Previous 
research often takes SINR and the availability as its decision 
condition. But it may still pick inappropriate decision, 
because good SINR will not necessarily brings good 
throughput. To avoid this, effective SINR is raised. It is used 
to calculate the data rate that could be completed. Besides, 
transmits in the in-door environment. The challenge is that the 
femtocell shares the frequency originally used by the base 
station. This may save the frequency, but it may also cause 
interference between the cells and the base station. Besides, the 
femtocell is a plug-and-play device that should have the ability 
to do self-organization. Figure 3 shows how cells interference 
with each other, and table 1 shows the types of interference.

D. The packet payload length calculation 
H.264/AVC is a high-coding-efficiency video coding 
technique and can compress the size of high-definition (HD) 
video frame into a smaller frame size for band-limited wireless 
environments. This application requires high transmission rates 
and low frame error rates. In the WiMedia system, the 
Distributed Reservation Protocol (DRP) mechanism could meet 
the requirement. The minimum number of reserved medium 
access slots to meet the strict error constraint and delay budget 
as well as the associated optimal payload length to maximize 
the throughput will be investigated in this paragraph. 
II. THE MAC EMULATION SYSTEM 
An MAC Emulation system is an verification architecture 
that can test the performance of the MAC layer of an 
communication system. It is designed under the Object-based 
concept shows in figure 2. Instead of the numerical data, it 
shows the performance that how a system works under a 
specific algorithm by real data flow.  
 
Figure 4. The object-based MAC Emulation System 
 
 The whole emulation system contains a BS system and could 
also contains many MS systems (or end user). They can both be 
set in real equipments, and communicates via computer network 
by TCP/IP protocols. The benefit of this architecture is that we 
can see the performance of the system under real applications. 
The block diagram of the separate BS and MS architecture is 
shows in the figure 5 and figure 6.

We continuously group the cells that are nearest to each other 
until all femtocells are in the same group. We can group them 
by different thresholds. The result is shows in figure 10. And the 
simulation results are shows in figure 11 and figure 12.

V. OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF H.264 HD VIDEO 
A. Minimal Reservation Slots 
Here we would like to calculate the minimum reservation 
slots. For HD video transmission in WiMedia system the 
locations of the transmitter and receiver are mostly fixed, so the 
transmission channel can be approximated as AWGN channel. 
In this case, the number of correct received packets X could be 
considered as a random variable with the binomial distribution. 
The probability mass function of X, ܤሺܺ, ோܰ, ܲሻ is: 
ܤሺܺ, ோܰ, ܲሻ ൌ ൬ ோܰܺ ൰ כ ܲ
௑ כ ሺ1 െ ܲሻேೃି௑  ሺ3ሻ
where ோܰ is the reserved packet number, and P is the packet 
success rate (PSR). 
If the frame error rate is Pe and suppose that a video frame is 
fragmented into ிܰ packets, then the packet error rate must be 
less than 1 െ ඥ1 െ ௘ܲಿಷ  to satisfy the error constraint. And the 
probability of the frame error rate is:

௜ כ ሺ1 െ ܲሻேೃି௜
ேಷିଵ
௜ୀ଴
  ሺ4ሻ 
where P is the packet success rate. 
In general, there will be multiple video frames, NMB, 
buffered and fragmented into NF  packets in the MAC before 
the transmssion. To meet the frame error rate, the resulting 
frame error rate from transmitting NMB video frames has to be 
less than  1 െ ሺ1 െ ௘ܲሻேಾಳ. 
The reserved packets NR will depend on total fragmented

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
A. Conclusions of the VHO algorithm 
In our research, we have shown that the proposed 
algorithm is important for the VHO control mechanism. It 
does improve the performance not only for VoIP service but 
the FTP service. Especially when the loading imbalance 
between WLAN and WiMAX networks increases, the 
performance in terms of VoIP packet drop rate or FTP 
throughput is improved significantly by such prediction 
method. As showed in figure 16 and figure 17.

Figure 17. Throughput for FTP traffic 
B. Conclusions of the Emulator 
The previous system verification is usually done by 
simulate on a single computer. We can see nothing more than 
numeric results. Maybe we have no idea what these numbers 
tell. But in our work, we propose a new approach. It is able to 
visualize the whole picture about the procedure. We can see 
clearly if the system works well under a specific algorithm by 
the quality of the video stream. We thought that this approach 
is more suitable for the coming application of multi-media 
service. 
C. Conclusions of the femtocell system 
The Hybrid mode is an effective way to decrease the 
effect of interference, even the users are few. The available 
resource is decided by the company of telecommunication. 
But the point here is that we can improve the performance by 
our method even under limited resource. We can improve the 
situation of interference and further the performance of the 
overall system. Maybe this could be a new approach that 
worth the cost of time and resource. 
D. Conclusions of the femtocell system 
In this part of research, we propose a new approach to solve 
the optimization problem of the system. An analytical model 
is established to calculate the minimal transmission time to 
satisfy the error constraint of real-time HD video. Instead of 
using the integer program method, we separate the calculation 
of optimal payload length and the look-up table for the 
number of required reservation slots. From our approach, only 
1% error is created, much improvement is made.
