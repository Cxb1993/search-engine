2. BACKGROUND: IN-LINE PHASE-CONTRAST IMAGING
2.1. Measurement model
An in-line imaging geometry is depicted in Fig. 1. In an ideal implementation, a monochromatic plane-wave Ui(r)
propagates along the positive z-axis and irradiates the object. The object is characterized by its complex-valued
refractive index distribution
n(r) ≡ 1− δ(r) + jβ(r), (1)
where r = (x, y, z), and δ(r) and β(r) describe the X-ray refractive and absorption properties of the object. The
transmitted waveﬁeld on a plane of constant z immediately behind the object is described as
Ut(x, y, z) = T (x, y)Ui, (2)
where T (x, y) is the transmission function that can be expressed generally as
T (x, y) = exp[−A(x, y) + jφ(x, y)]. (3)
Equation (2) assumes the validity of the projection approximation,12 which is valid for medical imaging appli-
cations at X-ray wavelengths. The attenuation A(x, y) and phase shift φ(x, y) functions are deﬁned as
A(x, y) = k
∫
dz β(r), (4)
and
φ(x, y) = −k
∫
dz δ(r), (5)
where k is the wavenumber. These quantities deﬁne the object’s projected X-ray attenuation and phase proper-
ties. On a detection plane z = zd behind the object, the measured intensity is related to the object properties
as
I(x, y) = |exp[−A(x, y) + jφ(x, y)] ∗2 hzd(x, y)|2, (6)
where hzd(x, y) and ∗2 denote the Fresnel propagator and the two-dimensional (2D) convolution operation. The
reconstruction problem of in-line imaging is to determine the images A(x, y) and φ(x, y) from the measured
intensity data I(x, y). To accomplish this, two independent measurements of I(x, y) are generally required.
2.2. Image reconstruction
Under certain assumptions regarding the transmitted waveﬁeld that are generally valid for medical imaging,13, 14
simple algebraic reconstruction formulas that determine A(x, y) and φ(x, y) have been derived.11, 15 Let Im(x, y)
denote the intensity data recorded on the detector plane z = zm, and let I˜m(u, v) denote its 2D Fourier transform

4. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Computer-simulation studies were conducted to investigate the statistical properties of in-line imaging.
4.1. Numerical phantom and image reconstruction
A complex-valued mathematical phantom that was comprised of a collection of uniform ellipsoids was taken
to represent the object’s refractive index distribution n(r). The energy of the incident monochromatic X-ray
beam was 60 KeV. The intensity of the transmitted waveﬁeld was assumed to be measured on two distinct
detector planes behind the object. Five imaging geometries were considered that possessed detector spacings
∆z = zm − zn = 26, 60, 80, 138 and 450 mm. The detector contained 128× 128 elements of dimension of 10
µm. From knowledge of the object and imaging geometries, sampled values of the simulated intensity data were
computed on the detector planes. Noisy versions of the intensity data were produced according to Eqn. (9),
where the standard deviation of the noise was σ = 1× 10−2 %. Estimates of the Fourier components of A(x, y)
and φ(x, y) were reconstructed by use of Eqns. (7) and (8). From these Fourier data, estimates of A(x, y) and
φ(x, y) were obtained by use of the 2D inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm.
4.2. Signal detection study
A simple signal detection study was performed to investigate how the diﬀerent noise textures in the estimates of
φ(x, y), corresponding to diﬀerent imaging geometries, aﬀect signal detectability. To investigate this, a signal-
known-exactly/background-known-exactly (SKE/BKE)18 detection task was considered. The signal of interest
was taken to be a low-contrast uniform sphere of radius 79.36 µm. This signal was embedded in a sphere of
radius 409.6 µm, which represented the background structure. For each of the imaging geometries described in
Section 4.1, an ensemble of 10,000 realizations of the noisy intensity data were computed, from which 10,000
noisy estimates of φ(x, y) were reconstructed.
A numerical Hotelling observer18 was employed in our studies to quantify signal detectability. The Hotelling
discriminant was computed readily due to the fact that the covariance matrix of φ(x, y) was known. The Hotelling
discriminant was applied to each noisy image, and the true positive fraction (TPF) and false positive fraction
(FPF) were computed at 200 threshold levels. From these data, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
were plotted.

to measure object detectability. We observed that, within the near-ﬁeld region, geometries with larger detector
spacings can yield improved detection performance over geometries with smaller ones.

發表論文題目 Influence of imaging geometry on noise texture in X-ray in-line phase-contrast imaging 
 
一、參加會議經過 
I arrived in San Diego on February 18, 2008 to attend the annual SPIE Medical Imaging 
conference. The conference was held at Town & Country Resort at San Diego, CA. The conference 
covered a wide range of topics including physics of medical imaging, imaging processing, 
computer-aided diagnosis, physiology, function, structure from medical images, image perception, 
observer performance, technology assessment, visualization, image-guided procedures, modeling 
PACS and imaging Informatics, ultrasonic imaging and signal processing.  
I was particularly interested in topics like physics of medical imaging, observer performance and 
computer-aided diagnosis, and spent most of my time in these sessions. I gave a presentation on the 
last day of the conference, February 21. The title of my talk was “Influence of imaging geometry on 
noise texture in X-ray in-line phase-contrast imaging”, which addressed noise properties of inline 
X-ray imaging reconstruction. An understanding of the second-order statistical properties of the 
reconstructed images is vital for characterizing how the imaging geometry affects object 
detectability, which will facilitate task-based system design. In this work, the covariance structure 
of the absorption and refractive index images was derived analytically, to characterize the noise 
texture in quantitative in-line phase-contrast imaging and tomography. It was well received and 
audiences expressed great interest in the topic and exchanged their opinions and thoughts with me.  
 
二、與會心得
