combining with seed layer concept at low temperature 
using ICPCVD. We have fabricated the CIASS (Copper 
Indium Aluminum Sulphur Selenide) solar cell with all 
sputtering plus two-step low-temperature selenization 
process. We achieved better quality ZnS layers having 
better transmittance of above 90%.  Also, an 
innovative surface texturing method based on nozzle-
sprayed microspheres and spin-coated dielectric film 
for the purpose of omnidirectional light-trapping was 
developed to boost up the efficiency of thin film 
solar cells illuminated in all directions. We believe 
a combination of SPA with a cap layer structure of 
CIAS/CIASS will help us to enable higher efficiency 
(about 21% ) solar energy even cheaper and can make 
more significant contributions to electricity 
production in the future.

structure is shown in Table.1. Fig.2. shows the J-V characteristics of this final 
optimized heterojunction cell (η = 17.04 %) with that of the optimized 
homojunction a-Si cell (η = 12.85 %) [1] and homojunction poly-Si cell obtained 
for well passivated grain boundary condition (recombination velocity is 
considered as 102 cms-1) and with a grain size of 10 µm [2]. It is obvious that 
efficiency expected from this novel p+- n1- n2- n
+ Si thin film solar cell is the 
highest reported to date for thinfilm Si solar cells. High quality a-Si:H, poly-Si 
and µc-Si thin films with optimum mobility is the key to achieve SPA structure

Fig. 3. XRD spectra of Si films grown with different H dilution ratios at 150 oC 
From the XRD data (Fig.3), it is very clear that by varying hydrogen dilution 
ratio we can deposit a-Si:H, µc-Si and poly-Si thin films using the same 
ICPCVD equipment for fabricating SPA structure. Also we observed that the 
growth rate of the Si film decreased from 16 Å /s to 3 Å /s as the H dilution 
increased from 20 % to 98 %. Therefore, a high deposition rate of 16 Å /s can 
be obtained for polycrystalline Si film, which is a great advantage for using

For further improving the Si thin film quality, we in cooperated seed layer 
method along with atomic hydrogen passivation treatment. Fig.9 and Fig. 10.

Good quality ZnS thin film with transmittance over 80% for wavelengths 
between 400nm~1000 nm is fabricated by RF sputtering method  (Fig.13 -

Another important work to be done for improving CIAS solar cell is the air- 
annealing  process [3].  In this method samples should be annealed in the 
air for several minutes and this will help the oxygen to diffuse in to the interface 
of CIAS absorber layer and ZnS buffer layer to passivate the dangling bonds 
and consequently will reduce the recombination at the grain boundaries. Also 
this will lead the Zn to diffuse in to absorber layer which will improve electronic 
properties of the absorber layer and efficiency of the solar cell.
