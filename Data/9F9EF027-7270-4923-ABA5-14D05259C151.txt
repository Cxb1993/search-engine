sinusoidal nor perfectly trapezoidal due to the manufacturing limitation and cost considerations. Moreover, 
precise encoders/resolvers for high speed applications are much more expensive than the low-cost Hall effect 
sensors. It is not surprising that rectangular commutation is widely adopted in electric bikes, electric scooters, 
automotive components, etc., in which these applications are very sensitive to cost but insensitive to torque 
ripple or magnetic noise.  
In order to achieve multiple functions such as starting in the stationary state, providing auxiliary power, 
regenerative braking and charging over a wide speed range which are required in advanced LEVs under 
various driving conditions, a bidirectional DC/AC power converter is indispensable. Because the issues 
concerning cost, volume, and reliability are even more rigorous when developing a LEV, the drive topology 
and the control strategy used in the hybrid electric vehicles cannot be applied to the LEVs directly. This study 
designs and realizes a single-stage bidirectional DC/AC converter based on a general full-bridge inverter, 
three possible switching strategies without any additional power switches or bulky passive components are 
studied and compared. The analysis, benefits, limitations experimental results and related applications of each 
switching strategy are provided in the following sections. 
 
II. Topology of bidirectional DC/AC converter 
When a BLDC machine is used as an assisted braking or charging device, it acts like an alternator or 
generator. In other words, the phase relationship of the back EMF and the armature current is out of phase in 
180 electric degrees. In general cases, the amplitude of the induced voltage over the general riding conditions 
is smaller than that of the battery voltage, namely one has to pump up the induced voltage high enough in 
order to charge the battery. Fig. 1 illustrates two possible topologies of the two-stage DC/AC converters used 
in most hybrid electric vehicles and electric cars [1-2]. 
Theoretically, the induced voltage can be pumped up to an arbitrary level based on the general full bridge 
inverter without any additional component, as shown in Fig. 2, if proper switching strategies are adopted [1-4]. 
In the following section, three proper switching strategies employed in this studied will be introduced and 
analyzed.

C. Regenerative braking by three-switches switching 
Power resistors have been widely used for conventional passive dynamic braking, namely the kinetic 
energy of electric machines is dissipated through the armature coils and the proper additional braking resistors. 
The principle of the three-switches regenerative braking is similar to that of the conventional dynamic braking, 
however the additional power resistors are eliminated. Moreover, the dynamic energy of the LEV can be 
recovered. Fig. 9 shows the phase relation among the back EMF, armature current, and the switching signals. 
The current paths of the machine in different operating states are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. The equivalent 
circuits are illustrated in Fig. 12. According to the principle of the volt-second balance and the principle of the 
capacitor charge balance, the charging voltage, averaged armature current and the maximum conversion ratio 
can be described in (11)~(13). Fig. 13 shows the maximum conversion ratio as K is increased from 0.01 to 1.

Table 1 summarizes the major characteristics of the three regenerative braking switching strategies for the 
general inverter. It should be noted that the voltage ratio equation can be used to determine whether the kinetic 
energy can be recovered when the speed and the parameters of the machine are known. Moreover, since the 
induced torque is proportional to the armature current, the braking torque can be estimated by the armature 
current equation.

IV. Experimental setup and results 
According to the driving conditions, the braking process can be classified as constant speed braking and 
variable speed braking. The constant speed braking is usually required during the downhill road driving, while 
the variable speed braking often occurs in the general deceleration process. Fig. 14 and 15 shows the block 
diagram and photographs of the experimental setup for two types of the different braking processes. The 
BLDC machine adopted in this study is a 8 pole machine, the rated power is 500W at 3000RPM, the armature 
resistance and inductance are 15.68mΩ and 37.4μH respectively. The flywheel shown in Fig. 15 is designed 
according to the specification of a mobility scooter, where the radius, thickness and density of the flywheel 
are 110mm, 15mm, and 7.87×103Kg/m3 respectively.

V. Conclusions 
This project studies three cost effective regenerative braking methods based on a general full-bridge 
inverter. The important performance indexes such as maximum voltage conversion ratio, braking torque, 
current stress, etc., are provided. Theoretical analysis and experimental results have verified that the recovery 
energy, braking torque, and reliability can be improved effectively within a variable braking control strategy 
according to the driving conditions. Since the additional power switches, passive components and costly 
precise position sensors are not required, the proposed method is particular suitable for various light electric 
vehicles.
