DO content. Using a confocal laser scanning 
microscope (CLSM), Tay et al. (2002d) determined 
that oxygen could be exhausted from a granule that 
was larger than 1.6 mm. Liu et al. (2005) noted a 
declined in specific substrate removal rate with large 
granules, indicating an inhabitation effect by mass 
transfer resistance. Restated, oxygen may become 
the rate-limiting substance that constrains 
performance of a granule system.  
Microsensors were used to evaluate the 
micro-environment of microbial communities 
(Revschech and Jorgensen, 1986), particularly 
microbial communities in a biofilm (Revsbech et al., 
1989; Kuhl and Jorgensen, 1992; Schramm et al., 
1996; Zhang an dBishop, 1994; Zhou and Bishop, 
1997, Yu and Bishop, 1999; 2001; Bishop and Yu, 
1999; Li and Bishop, 2002; de Beer et al., 1998). 
Recently the microelectrode method has been 
extensively applied to evaluate the micro-transport 
processes in an activated sludge floc (de Beer D et 
al., 1998; Schramm Aet al., 1999a, 1999b Ploug and 
Jorgensen, 1999, Li and Bishop, 2004) and in 
aerobic granules (Jang et al., 2003). The 
microelectrode method has also been employed in 
much of the literature to probe the steady-state (or, at 
least, pseudo-steady state) diffusion process. 
Restated, biochemical reaction occurred 
simultaneously with DO diffusion, whereas the mean, 
steady-state profiles of pH, DO, NH4+, NO3- and 
other ions, were obtained using a microelectrode. 
The biochemical reaction of substances 
counterbalances the diffusional flux to achieve 
steady-state conditions, suggesting that the oxygen 
diffusivity and the associated rate constant for 
chemical kinetics inside the granule cannot be 
evaluated independently of each other using 
steady-state measurements despite that the reaction 
rates over the entire biomass were constant (Beuling 
et al., 2000). 
Cronenberg and van den Heuvel (1991) 
proposed the use of a micro-electrode to probe the 
change in concentration of glucose at center of 
biofilm which was subjected to a stepwise change in 
bulk concentration. By doing so, the diffusion 
coefficient of glucose in biofilm could be extracted 
from the time sequence data if the biofilm is inactive. 
Beuling et al. (2000) propose that at another extreme 
when the entire biofilm was active and exhibited the 
same reaction rates, the diffusion coefficient data 
could also be acquired by tracking local response of 
species under sudden change. 
No estimation of oxygen diffusivity in aerobic 
granules has been reported to the authors’ best 
knowledge. Although granules were normally taken 
as a special form of biofilm, no evidences were 
available that all characteristics measured for biofilm 
could be used for granules. There also existed few 
studies conducted dynamic tests on the response of 
biofilm subjected to environmental changes. This 
work estimated oxygen diffusivity of two types of 
aerobic granules, acetate-fed and phenol-fed, by 
probing the DO level at the granule center with a 
sudden change in the DO of the bulk liquid. The 
flow velocity across the granule was set such that the 
external mass transfer resistance was negligible. The 
testing time was short while no external nutrients 
were provided, to allow a much lower chemical 
reaction rate (if any) than the diffusional rate of 
oxygen. Then, the oxygen diffusivity of aerobic 
granule was estimated with reference to a 
one-dimensional diffusion model that considers only 
internal mass transfer resistance. 
 
II. 實驗 
Granules cultivated using acetate or phenol as 
the carbon source were examined. All granules were 
cultivated at 20oC, by adding 1.25 l of municipal 
activated sludge (3000 mg l-1) as a seed sludge. 
For the acetate-fed granule, a column-type 
sequential aerobic sludge blanket reactor (150 cm 
high; 5 cm diameter) with a working volume of 2.5 l 
was used. The reactor was fed with the seed sludge 
and an acetate-based synthetic wastewater with 
mineral compositions half concentrations to Tay et al. 
(2001). This synthetic wastewater had acetate as the 
sole carbon source and a substrate concentration 
equivalent to 1000 mg chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) l-1. Fine air bubbles for aeration and mixing 
were supplied through a dispenser at the reactor 
bottom at an airflow rate of superficial velocity of 2 
cm s-1. The reactor was operated sequentially in 4 hr 
cycles (4 min of influent filling, 202 to 227 min of 
aeration, 5 to 30 min of settling and 4 min of effluent 
withdrawal). Effluent was discharged 60 mm above 
the reactor bottom at a volumetric exchange ratio of 
50%, giving a hydraulic retention time of 8 hr and a 
COD loading rate of 3 kg COD m-3 d-1. Mature 
aerobic granules were obtained from the third week 
of reactor operation. 
For phenol-fed granules, the cultivation was 
carried out in a column-type (120 cm height; 5 cm 
diameter) reactor with a working volume of 2 l. The 
reactor was aerated with an airflow rate of 
superficial velocity of 2.5 mm s-1. Synthetic 
wastewater containing phenolic compound similar to 
that used in Jiang et al. (2002) was applied to 
by Li and Bishop (2004) was devised to maintain the 
bio-aggregate physically in a stream of flowing 
water (Fig. 1). The granule (or floc) was extracted 
carefully using a wide mouth pipette and placed on a 
membrane in the testing chamber (Fig. 1a). Two DO 
microelectrodes were then placed at the center and 
the outer surface of the bio-aggregate. Thereafter, the 
granule-microelectrode assembly was moved 
upward and fixed in the free stream. The appearance 
of the granule (or floc) under a microscope did not 
change noticeably following electrode piercing. The 
diameter of the microelectrode was much smaller 
than that of the granule (or the floc) under 
investigation, so its effects on the internal structure 
and the associated mass transfer resistance were 
negligible. As shown later, all tests were conducted 
at a sufficient high crossflow velocity to insure that 
the external mass transfer resistance of oxygen from 
bulk stream to surface being safely ignored and the 
surface concentration equaled that in bulk flow. 
Hence, the location of the electrode on the granule 
(or floc) surface did not affect the experimental 
findings. 
The incoming water stream was switched 
between water streams #1 - distilled water saturated 
with oxygen by aeration - and stream #2- water 
deoxygenized by nitrogen stripping (Fig. 1b). Before 
the test, stream #1 was flowing steadily over the 
granules (or the floc) at the specified speed for over 
half an hour. The flowing stream contained no 
nutrient and the test period was short in relation to 
the endogenous respiration rate, the DO levels at the 
granule center reached that in the incoming water. 
The incoming stream was then suddenly switched to 
stream #2 to allow the internal oxygen to diffuse out 
of the granule (floc). After testing stream #2 for 5 
min, a switch was made back to stream #1 again for 
five more minutes. This procedure repeated and the 
DO signals from the microelectrodes were recorded 
for two increasing phases and two declining phases 
in each test. Three tests were conducted for each 
sample to ensure the reproducibility of the data. 
Before and after the test the steady-state readings of 
DO electrodes were recorded to assure that the 
electrodes were not broken and the data were 
reliably assessed. 
 
IV. 結果與討論 
Increasing the external flow velocity suppressed 
the resistance to external mass transfer from the bulk 
phase to the surface of granule (or floc). An 
excessive crossflow velocity would have degraded 
and blown away the granule. Preliminary tests were 
conducted to determine how high the upflow 
velocity had to be to minimize the external mass 
transfer resistance, while maintaining the integrity of 
the granule (or the floc) in the flowing stream. 
Figure 2 plots the DO responses at the center of 
an acetate-fed granule (2.5 mm) at three upflow 
velocities. The DO responses slowly merged at 
V>0.002 m s-1, indicating that, at or above this 
specific upflow velocity, the effects of resistance to 
external mass transfer could be safely neglected. 
The mass transfer relationship from a sphere in 
a uniform flow of V is given by the following 
Frossling equation (42): 
0.5 1/3
2.0 0.6ck d dV
D D
ρ µ
µ ρ
⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞= + ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠   (1) 
where kc, d, D, ρ and µ are the external mass transfer 
coefficient (m s-1), the granule (floc) diameter (m), 
the binary diffusivity of the oxygen in bulk water 
(m2 s-1), the density of water (kg m-3) and the 
viscosity of water (Pa s), respectively. At upflow 
velocities of 0.0013, 0.0020 and 0.0040 m s-1, the 
corresponding Reynolds numbers were 0.78, 1.2 and 
2.4, respectively. The Schmidt number of water at 
21oC is 434.8. Accordingly, the corresponding 
Sherwood numbers are 6.01, 6.98 and 9.04, yielding 
mass transfer coefficients of 2.29x10-5, 2.65x10-5 
and 3.44x10-5 m2 s-1, respectively. Since the 
diffusivity coefficient of the wastewater sludge floc 
would be shown to be 4.0x10-10 m2 s-1 in latter 
sections, the corresponding Biot numbers were 34.3, 
39.8 and 51.5, respectively. Accordingly, at V>0.002 
m s-1, at which the Biot number was greater than 
unity, the effects of external mass transfer resistance 
were negligible (Mills, 1995). The upflow velocity 
in this work was set to 0.004 m s-1 in all tests to 
minimize external mass transfer resistances. Since 
the wastewater floc was rather fragile, tests with 
even higher crossflow velocities would blow away 
the floc from the electrodes and testing chamber. 
Figure 3 presents the DO responses of an 
acetate-fed granule (2.5 mm in diameter) to sudden 
switches between stream #1 and #2. A very small 
electrode and a very large signal amplification ratio 
are used, so the tracked DO signals fluctuated with 
time, which fact is a natural shortcoming of dynamic 
testing because no time-averaging procedures can be 
used to minimize noise. However, the DO 
concentration clearly fell (or rose) more slowly than 
in bulk water. This observation revealed a finite 
internal mass transfer resistance of oxygen in 
acetate-fed granules. Other sampled acetate-fed 
granules with diameters of 1.28-2.25 mm behaved 
 3
size than the phenol-fed granule compensated for the 
effects of the higher diffusivity of the former and 
was responsible for the greater overall resistance to 
oxygen transfer. 
The carbon source considerably influenced the 
oxygen diffusivity of granule: the phenol-fed granule 
referred to in Fig. 4 exhibited only 18% of the 
diffusivity of the acetate-fed granule referred to in 
Fig. 3, which might be attributable to the fact that 
the phenol-fed granule contained much more 
excellular polymer (ECP) (98.7 mg g-1 VSS) than the 
acetate-fed granule (5.88 mg g-1 VSS). The sludge 
floc also exhibited a high ECP content (136.1 mg g-1 
VSS), and displayed an apparent diffusivity that was 
similar to that of the phenol-fed granule. The excess 
ECP, although invisible under a contrast microscope, 
provides diffusional resistance against toxic 
chemicals, and reduced the SOUR value (Table 1). 
As Beuling et al. (2000) stated, the Dapp reported 
herein could be related to the effective diffusivity by 
correcting the effects of impermeable volume 
fraction, herein including the roles of microbes and 
the ECP. With excessive ECP, the apparent 
diffusivity declined accordingly. 
Variously sized granules were collected and 
tested. Figure 7 plots the resulting diffusivity data 
versus the granule size. The figure also presents the 
datum for the wastewater sludge floc for comparison. 
For a homogeneous, isotropic porous medium, the 
diffusivity of oxygen should be independent of the 
granule size. However, as Fig. 7 indicates, the 
diffusivity of oxygen increased with granule size, 
1.24-2.28x10-9 m2 s-1 for 1.28-2.50 mm acetate-fed 
granules, and 2.50-7.65x10-10 m2 s-1 for 0.42-0.78 
mm phenol-fed granules. In particular, the 
acetate-fed granules exhibited the linear relationship 
 (rdDapp ∝ 2=0.82) whereas the phenol-fed 
granules exhibited the power-law relationship, 
 (r2dDapp ∝ 2=0.92). 
Wastewater sludge flocs have a fractal-like 
structure (Li and Ganczarczyk, 1989). Wu et al. 
(2002) further established that some activated sludge 
flocs have a fractal-in-fractal structure. Bellouti et al. 
(1997) established that the granules formed by the 
anaerobic UASB process had a fractal-like 
appearance. The data presented in Fig. 7 indicate 
that the aerobic granules also had a 
non-homogeneous structure (if not fractal-like), 
which enabled the diffusivity of oxygen to be 
varying. Pores and channels presented in aerated 
granules were well documented (Tay et al., 2003, 
Ivanov et al., 2004). Zhang et al. (1995) noted that, 
owing to compaction effect, the porosity and oxygen 
diffusivity would decrease when moved into the 
biofilm. Aerobic granule was supposed to be a form 
of compact biofilm, hence should be having low 
porosity and low oxygen permeability. 
Figures 8a-c show the confocal images of the 
cross-section of an acetate-fed granule by detecting 
the distributions of nucleic acids, proteins, and 
polysaccharides. A large pore and numerous small 
pores were detected in the granule. The diameter of 
the largest pores increased with the floc size (Wu et 
al., 2003), whereas the diffusion coefficient of the 
substances fell when the pores were tortuous and 
zigzag along its length (such as in the fine pores of 
granules) (Chu and Lee, 2004a, b). Although the 
detailed investigation on the pore size distribution 
within aerobic granules is still lacking, there is a 
better chance for large granules to exhibit large pores, 
while small granules to have small pores. The 
diffusivity of oxygen can thus naturally be inferred 
to be higher in larger granules (which have larger 
pores). However, why the different carbon sources 
lead to different power indices in the relationship 
between Dapp and d remains unclear. However, we 
clearly showed in this study that the permeability of 
oxygen is a size-dependent property. Hence to report 
a mean value of diffusivity without information on 
the distribution of granule size or the correlation 
between permeability and size would not be 
sufficient to fully characterize the diffusional 
processes in aerobic granule systems. 
 
V. 結論 
 We recorded the changes in dissolved oxygen 
concentrations around and inside aerobic granules 
when the oxygen levels of the surrounding liquid 
were suddenly changed. Two aerobic granules, 
incubated in acetate or phenol-containing water, and 
an activated sludge floc were the testing samples. 
The electrode locating at granule center revealed a 
time lag to that at granule surface (and in bulk flow), 
indicating a finite internal mass transfer resistance of 
oxygen existed in granules. We modeled the granule 
as a porous sphere of diameter d and the apparent 
diffusivity of oxygen is Deff. Then using a simple, 
one-dimensional transient diffusion model we 
estimated the oxygen diffusivities of aerobic 
granules and sludge floc. 
The carbon source considerably influenced the 
oxygen diffusivity of granule: the phenol-fed granule 
exhibited only 18% of the diffusivity of the 
acetate-fed granule, being attributable to the much 
more excellular polymer (ECP) for the former than
