Abstract 
 
In this project, we mainly study some scheduling problems with total transmission of learning 
from batch to batch in a production system. The learning phenomena are existed in many 
realistic intermittent production systems. For example, in a painting production system, the 
same products are produced, but colors of products among batches are different. We consider 
the single-machine makespan minimization problem with such a learning effect model. Two 
polynomial time solutions are provided to solve two special cases of this problem. However, the 
time-complexity of the problem is still worth a further study. 
 
Keywords: intermittent production system, learning effect, scheduling

flow-time minimization problem with the learning effect on parallel identical machines has a 
polynomial time solution. Mosheiov and Sidney (2003) extended learning effect to be 
job-dependent, that is, learning rates are different from job to job. They showed that the 
problems of makespan and total flow-time minimization on a single machine, a due-date 
assignment problem and total flow-time minimization on unrelated parallel machines remain 
polynomially solvable. For more research results on scheduling problems with other learning 
effect models under different machine environments, the readers are referred to the review paper 
of Biskup (2008). 
The above learning effect models tell us that, as cumulative jobs increase, the processing 
time of the subsequent job decreases in a continuous production system. It gives the implication 
of continuous production rather than intermittent batch production. However, many realistic 
production systems are intermittent, for example, production systems with the applications of 
“group technology”. That is, different products with similar designs and/or production processes 
are grouped together to produce in a production run. In such intermittent production, it is 
reasonable to assume that if plenty of time has elapsed between production runs, the learning 
effect would not continue to follow what it was left when production resumes, but that the 
processing time of the subsequent job would revert to a higher level. This suggests a 
phenomenon of forgetting between production runs. Keachie and Fontana (1966) also indicated 
that transmission of learning from period to period can depend on many variables, such as the 
type of work performed, the time between manufacturing periods, the length of time required to 
manufacture the lot and the labor turnover. Therefore, there may be total, partial or even no 
transmission of learning from one production run to another one. In this project, we focus on the 
single-machine scheduling problem with the total transmission model of learning and forgetting 
effects in intermittent batch production.  
                                                                                     
2. Notations and assumptions 
The problem is developed using the following notations. Additional notations will be 
introduced when needed throughout the paper. 
m  : the number of batches. ( 2≥m ) 
  iB  : the ith batch, i=1, 2, …, m. 
  in   : the number of jobs in batch iB , i=1, 2, …, m. 
n   : the total number of jobs. (i.e. nnnn m =+++ ...21 ) 
  ijJ  : the jth job in batch iB ,  j=1, 2, …, in . 
ia   : the learning factor of jobs within batch iB . ( 0≤ia ) 
  ijp  : the normal processing time of ijJ  in the original sequence. 
r
ijp  : the actual processing time of ijJ  which is scheduled in the r
 th position 
6 
normal processing times. 
Proof. The theorem can be easily proved by using simple job interchanging technique.         
□ 
 
Corollary 1. For the problem of max/,,/1 CTLEB total , there exists an optimal schedule by 
sequencing jobs within each batch in non-decreasing order of their normal processing times. 
Proof. The result follows directly from Theorem 2.        □ 
 
In the following, two special cases of the problem of max/,,/1 CTLEB total  are discussed in 
Theorem 2 and Algorithm 1, respectively. 
 
Definition 1. iB  is dominated by jB , or jB  dominates iB  iff 
},...,2,1|max{ iik nkp = },...,2,1|min{ jjk nkp =≤ . The symbol ji BB ≺  denotes that iB  is 
dominated by jB . 
 
Definition 2. The batches form an increasing sequence of dominating batches iff 
mBBB ≺≺≺ ...21 . 
 
Theorem 2. If mBBB ≺≺≺ ...21  and maaa === ...21 , then for the problem of 
max/,,/1 CTLEB total , there exists an optimal schedule satisfies the following conditions.  
(a) the jobs within a batch are sequenced in non-decreasing order of their normal processing 
times. 
(b) the batches are arranged as an increasing sequence of dominating batches. 
Proof. The theorem can be easily proved by using simple job interchanging technique.       
□ 
 
Next, if the job numbers of all batches are equal (i.e. nm
nnnn m ===== ...21 ), then the 
proposed problem can be formulated as an assignment problem. Again, let irx  be a 0/1 variable 
such that irx = 1 if batch iB  is the rth batch to be processed and irx = 0 otherwise. Then, the 
problem to minimize the makespan of all jobs is formulated as follows.

Abstract 
 
In this paper we introduce a general learning effect model into a single-machine scheduling 
problem. The general learning effect model combines two learning factors. One is the job-independent 
learning model. The other is the total weighted time-dependent learning model. That is, the complexity 
(or similarity) of these jobs, which will have different influences on the learning of the following job in 
a sequence. Some useful properties are provided to find the optimal job-sequence in the single-
machine scheduling problems. In addition, some learning models are proved to be special cases of the 
general learning effect model. 
 
Keywords: scheduling, single machine, learning effect, makespan, total completion time, maximum 
lateness. 
1. Introduction 
 
Recently, there is a growing interest in the literature to study scheduling problems with a learning 
effect. Biskup [1] was the first to investigate the learning effect in scheduling problems. He 
assumed a learning process that reflects a decrease in the processing time as a function of the 
number of repetitions of the production of a single item, i.e. as a function of the job position in the 
sequence. Biskup showed that the single-machine scheduling problem with the consideration of

where ja  is a negative job-dependent parameter. It proposes a concept that different jobs have 
different learning effects. This approach is more reasonable. However, it still can not clearly 
describe time-dependent learning situations mentioned above. That is, the more time you practice, 
the better learning performance you will obtain. Thus, Kuo and Yang [4] introduced a time-
dependent learning effect model and incorporated it into some single-machine scheduling problems.  
In the time-dependent learning effect model, the actual processing time of job j if scheduled in 
position r is given as follows.

where 0≤a  is a constant leaning index and ][kp   is the normal processing time of a job if 
scheduled in position k in a sequence. In such a learning effect assumption, the actual processing 
time of a job is affected by the total normal processing time of the previous (r-1) jobs scheduled in 
front of it. 
It is more reasonable for that the more time you practice, the better learning performance you will 
obtain. However, different jobs may have different influences on the learning. Therefore, we will 
introduce a more general learning effect model in this paper. Then we incorporate it into single-
machine scheduling problems. The objective of the scheduling problem is to minimize the makespan 
of all jobs. We propose some useful properties to find the optimal solution. In addition, some learning 
models are proved to be special cases of the proposed model. 
 
 
2. The general learning effect model 
 
As mentioned above, the learning of a job is affected by two factors. One is the job-independent 
learning model. The other is the total weighted time-dependent learning model. That is, the 
Property 1. For the max//1 CLEg  problem, there exists an optimal schedule that satisfies the 
following condition: if ji ww ≥  and jjii pwpw ≤ , then job i is scheduled ahead of job j. 
Proof. Property 1 can be proved by a pairwise interchange of jobs. Let ),,,,( 211 ππ ijh JJJS =  
denote a sequence with job j ( jJ ) in position r and job i ( iJ ) in position (r+1). 1π  and 2π  are the 
partial sequences of 1S .  In addition, 1π  or 2π  may be empty. We will show that it does not 
increase the makespan to interchange jJ  and iJ  in 1S . Thus, we deduce that Property 1 holds. 
 Let 2S  be the same sequence with jJ  and iJ  in opposite positions. In addition, let )( 1SCl  denote 
the completion time of lJ  in sequence 1S  and )( 2SCl  denote the completion time of lJ  in 
sequence 2S .  Then we have

the proof.   □ 
 
If the processing times of all jobs are equal, i.e. ppi = , then the following corollary can be easily 
obtained. 
 
Corollary 2. For the problem max/,/1 CppLE ig = , there exists an optimal schedule in which jobs are 
sequenced in non-increasing order of iw . 
 
4. Some solvable cases 
 
Case 1. Job-independent learning effect model 
If ii pw 1=   for all i (i = 1, 2,…, n) and 0=b , then the sufficient conditions of the optimal 
schedule in Property 1 to Property 4 reduce to ji pp ≤ . That is, the optimal job sequence is the 
shortest processing time first. In addition, Eq.(4) simplifies to 
 aj
r
j rpp = ,   .,...,1, nrj =   
That is, the expression for the general learning effect model simplifies to the job-independent 
learning effect model. Therefore, the max//1 CLEg  and ∑ ig CLE //1  problems reduce to 
max//1 CLE and ∑ iCLE //1  problems presented by Mosheiov [7] and Biskup [1], respectively. 
 
Case 2. Time-dependent learning effect model  
the general learning effect model. However, we note that the computational complexity of the 
problem remains an open question, and solving it seems an interesting topic for future research.
