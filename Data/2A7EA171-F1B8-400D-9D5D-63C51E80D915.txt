Abstract 
Titanium dioxide nanofibers were fabricated via a polymer-assisted electrospinning technique.  
A mixture of titanium-tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) in an alcohol 
medium utilized as the sol-gel solution was ejected through a needle under a strong electrical field.  
In company with the solvent evaporation and the sol-gel solidification, highly charged polymer jet 
induces the formation of polymer/metal oxide nanofibers before reaching to the ground electrode. 
Calcination process was carried out afterward to encourage the crystallization and phase 
transformation of titania, as well as the removal of polymer domains.  Electrospinning process and 
calcined titania nanofibers exhibited strong relationship with the presence of polymer media.  
Process parameters and the characterizations of nanoconstructed titania nanofibers were 
investigated and discussed.

Incorporation of metal oxide materials with electrospun polymer nanofibers has also been 
developed recently.  For instance, metal oxide tube made by sol-gel coating onto electrospun 
polymer fibers.24  Additions of metal oxide precursors in the polymer-based electrospinning 
solutions led to the formation of metal oxide nanofibers.25, 26 
Nanofiber mats prepared by electrospinning processes provide large amount of surface area.  
Different from zero-dimensionalna noscale materials, one-dimensional nanofibers also have the 
continuous connection which can be further utilized in tailing their anisotropic physical properties 
with the great potential as charge collectors and conduction networks for photovoltaic devices. 
The purpose of this study is to fabricate crystallized titania nanofibers through a 
polymer-assisted electrospinning technique.  Fabrications and characterizations of these 
electrospun titania nanofibers in terms of fiber diameters, surface area, crystallite sizes, and 
mesoporous structures, were investigated and discussed.   
The loadings of TiO2 precursor, TTIP, were adjusted so that titania will crystallize within 
one-dimensional nanofibers with different diameters and different polymer/TTIP ratios.  
Electrospun nanofibers provide one-dimensional environment for TTIP to grow into crystallized 
TiO2.  Effects of polymer media on electrospun TiO2 nanofibers were discussed. 
 
2、Experimental Section 
Preparations of electrospinning solution  
A TTIP (titanium-tetraisopropoxide) sol-gel solution was prepared by the mixture of 3 mL of 
acetic acid and 3 mL of ethanol, followed by the dropwise addition of TTIP precursors.  The 
adding of acetic acid is necessary to stable TTIP. 
The sol-gel solution was enclosed and stirred in a beaker for 10 minutes. It is necessary to 
introduce polymer media into electrospinning solution, in order to take the advantage of good 
ductility nature of polymers.  Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) was used as the polymer base due to its 
solubility in alcohols and compatibility with titania precursors.26, 27  
The polymer-based sol-gel solution was completed by adding a solution containing 0.42 g of 
PVP and 8 mL of ethanol.  The resulting slightly yellow solution was transparent and showed no 
precipitation even after hours stirring.  Various amounts of TTIP loading in the polymer-based 
sol-gel solutions were summarized in Table 1.   
Fabrications of Titania Nanofibers by Electrospinning

formation of undesired beads (Figure 1d and 1e), which had been linked to the conflict between the 
surface tension and the charge density.28  The surface tension of electrospinning solutions tended 
to minimize itself and to form sphere droplets in order to reduce the surface area.  On the other 
hand, the high voltage induced electrostatic tension tends to achieve least charge density (charge per 
unit area) by increasing surface area.   
The electrospinning solution with higher TTIP loading such as ef13 will get “gel” much 
quickly.  In another words, the viscosity of electrospinning solution increased quickly to maintain 
the smooth nanofibers of ef13 without undesired beads (see Figure 1a).  The drastically increased 
viscosity also prevents electrostatic tension which separates electrospun jet into smaller fibers.  
Since the steric-resistance of PVP will restrict the formation of the Ti–O–Ti network,29 the viscosity 
of the ef31 electrospinning solution increases slowly during electrospinning process.  The 
electrospinning solution with low viscosity will be easily split into smaller nanofibers.  And the 
surface tension will induce the nanofiber morphologies with beads.  As shown in Figure 1e, ef31 
possessed smaller diameter and more beads.

(c) ef11, (d) ef21, (e) ef31, and (f) PVP fibers. (scale bars are 5µm) 
 
To confirm the gel effect of TTIP on the diameter and morphology of electrospun nanofibers, 
electrospining solution without any TTIP loading was also electrospun as shown in Figure 1f.  The 
fiber diameters were even smaller and many large beads formed due to the surface tension.

wt% for ef21-550, as the increase of PVP in the original sol-gel media.  More PVP loading 
resulted in more rutile phase appeared.  Another sol-gel system based on Ti(OBun)4 and PVP  
media have been reported to have similar results.31   
 
 
Figure 3. X-ray diffraction patterns of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers calcined at (a) 450oC and (b) 
550oC. 
The nucleation of rutile nuclei may be easier in the heterogeneous nucleation between titania 
and PVP, which resulted in lower anatase to rutile phase transformation temperature.  Scherrer 
formula32 was also utilized to determine the crystallite sizes (or the grain sizes) from XRD patterns: 
θβ
λ
cos
89.0=D  
where D is the average crystallite size (or the grain diameter), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray 
radiation (Cu Kα = 0.154 nm), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) to the (1 0 1) reflection 
for anatase and FWHM to the (110) reflection for rutile, and θ is the corresponding diffraction 
angle. 
Figure 4 illustrated the diameters of as-spun and calcined samples as a function of PVP/TTIP 
ratio.  Sizes of corresponding anatase TiO2 nanograins were also labeled as spheres with the 
crystallite diameters.  Rutile mass fractions of ef11-550 and ef21-550 were also shown in Figure 4.  
As the calcination temperature was fixed at 450oC, the decrease of TTIP concentrations in 
PVP-containing sol-gel solutions resulted in both reductions of fiber diameters (Dcalcined, 450oC) from 
380 nm to 80 nm and crystallite sizes ( anatased ) from 16 nm to 8.4 nm.  PVP media may cover on 
the surface of titania to prevent the diffusion between particles, which resulted in smaller anatase 
crystallite size in ef21-450. (see Table 1, more PVP content was in the electrospinning solution of 
ef21)

Anatase to rutile phase transformation begins with the nucleation of rutile on anatase and the 
rutile nuclei grow throuout the anatase particle till completion by interparticle sintering.33, 34 
There may be a critical size for anatase nanocrystallite to transform into rutile phase at 550oC, 
and only anatase nanocrystallites smaller than this critical size can transform into rutile phase at this 
relatively low temperature.  It may be the reason why the crystallite sizes of 550oC calcined 
nanofibers were all about 20 nm.  Anatase nanocrystallites larger than the critical size were 
enlarged to be about 20 nm without transformation into rutile phase.  In the other hand, anatase 
nanocrystallites smaller than the critical size were transformed into rutile phase at 550oC.  It may 
be the reason why rutile mass fraction of ef21-550 was as high as 58% and almost no rutile phase 
can be observed in XRD patterns of ef12-550. (see Figure 3b) 
4、 Conclusion 
TiO2 nanofibers were fabricated through a polymer-assisted electrospinning process.  As-spun 
PVP/TTIP nanofibers with diameters ranged from 930 nm to 90 nm were electrospun from the 
sol-gel recipes of various PVP/TTIP ratios. 
As the calcination temperature was fixed at 450oC, the decrease of TTIP loadings in 
PVP-containing sol-gel solutions resulted in both reductions of fiber diameters (Dcalcined, 450oC) from 
380 nm to 80 nm and crystallite sizes ( anatased ) from 16 nm to 8.4 nm.  At 550
oC calcination 
temperature, on the other hand, the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation showed great dependence 
on the fiber diameters and polymer media.
