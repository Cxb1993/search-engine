Perceptually Optimized Rate Control for JPEG2000 Coding of Color Images 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
JPEG2000 is a new international standard for still im-
age compression.  However, the conventional rate 
control scheme, known as post-compression rate-
distortion (PCRD) optimization, is not efficient and 
thus hindering the JPEG2000 from cost-effective im-
plementation.  The coder is designed to encode the 
whole image completely and then generate the entire bit 
stream even though a large portion of the encoded data 
may not be included in the final code stream.  Most of 
the computation and memory usage become redundant 
especially when images are encoded at lower bit rates. 
In this paper, a perceptually optimized three-stage rate 
control algorithm is proposed to reduce both the com-
putational complexity and the memory usage over the 
conventional PCRD method for maintaining the visual 
quality.  The first stage is to allocate coding bits to 
each code block according to the associated signal en-
ergy.  The second stage approaches the final trunca-
tion point through calculating rate-distortion slopes.  
The third stage incorporates the evaluation of percepti-
ble distortion into the rate-distortion control scheme of 
PCRD method to achieve the optimal truncation point 
without encoding all the image data.  Simulation re-
sults show that, in both computational complexity and 
memory usage, the performance of the proposed rate 
control algorithm is superior to that of the JPEG2000 
rate control algorithm while achieving the same visual 
quality at the target bit rate. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
JPEG2000 is the next generation image compression 
standard [1].  Like many other image and video coding 
standards, JPEG2000 specifies the bit-stream syntax for 
the compressed image data and leaves enough room for 
innovations in implementing efficient coders. 
JPEG2000 is a wavelet-based coder where coefficients 
in each wavelet subband are quantized by a scalar quan-
tizer and partitioned into non-overlapping code blocks 
of same dimension.  These code blocks are then en-
coded by the algorithm of embedded block coding with 
optimized truncation (EBCOT) [2] in two stages as 
Tier-1 and Tier-2 coding.  In Tier-1 coding, each code 
block is bit-plane encoded from the most significant bit 
(MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) to result in an 
independent embedded bit stream.  Except for one-
pass coding of the MSB plane, each bit-plane is en-
coded in three coding passes.  The distortion reduced 
and the bit-rate increased after each coding pass is col-
lected for a rate control procedure known as post-
compression rate distortion (PCRD) algorithm [2]. In 
Tier-2 coding, independent bit streams from Tier-1 cod-
ing are truncated according to a set of truncation points 
found by the PCRD optimization, and assembled to 
form the final code stream.  In PCRD algorithm, the 
technique of Lagrange multiplier is used to find an op-
timal rate-distortion slope, λ, and an associated set of 
truncation points {nZ,i(λ)}, such that the cost function

)(

nZ,i(λ). To collect the distortion reduced and the bit rate 
increased after each coding pass for computing the rate-
distortion slopes at all possible truncation points, all the 
quantized coefficients are required to be encoded in the 
Tier-1 stage and stored in the memory buffer even 
though a large portion of the encoded data will not be 
included in the final code stream of the Tier-2 coding 
stage.  A significant percentage of computation and 
memory usage is therefore wasted on coding and stor-
ing the unwanted data. The non-causal process of 
PCRD also takes a longer latency in transmitting the 
tolerance volume in the CIELAB.  The values of para-
metric constants 
Lk , Ck , and Hk  can be adjusted to 
optimize the color difference equations for the assess-
ment under the conditions other than basis ones. 
In this paper, it is assumed that a 00E∆  value of 
around 1.5 corresponds to a JNCD.  Hence, colors that 
are perceptually indistinguishable from a particular 
color in the CIELAB color space theoretically form a 
sphere with a radius equal to JNCD.  The JNCD 
spheres with equal radius in the CIELAB are shown in 
Fig. 1(a).  It is noted that the JNCD threshold of each 
color pixel is larger than 1.5 in our experiments.  
JNCD is originally obtained from the matching of color 
samples that are homogeneous without apparent pattern 
and luminance is a dominant component that affects the 
human visual perception.  For the color pixel in a 
complex image, the threshold of perceptible color dif-
ference can be increased due to local luminance proper-
ties.  Here, the scale factor is given as a function of 
luminance gradient and average background luminance.  
Hence, a luminance dominated factor is exploited to 
adapt the JNCD threshold of each color pixel with its 
related characteristics.  In the color visual model, the 
adaptive JNCD (AJNCD) shown in Fig. 1(b) is ex-
pressed by 
)),(( YYESJNCDAJNCD L ∆⋅=  (2) 
where )),(( YYESL ∆  denotes the luminance dominated 
factor, )(YE  represents the average background lumi-
nance and Y∆  represents the luminance gradient. 
As described in [7], the color visual model is then to 
build for each color pixel in a color space the AJNCD 
sphere in the CIELAB space.  By considering that 
luminance is the dominant factor affecting the visual 
perception, color samples that are on the surface of the 
AJNCD sphere and differ from the target color in the 
luminance component by luminance JND are selected 
for color mapping.  Two conditions can be utilized to 
locate color samples.   
1.) The hue of color samples is the same with that of 
the target color, 0' =∆ abH , the perceptual color dif-
ferences between the target color and color samples

From Eq. (3), (4), color samples are found.  By map-
ping the AJNCD sphere back to the original color space, 
the perceptually indistinguishable region in this color 
space can be defined.  The perceptual redundancy in 
terms of JND threshold for three color channels can 
then be conservatively estimated by the color samples 
that are most close to the target color. 
 
3. THE PERCEPTUALLY OPTIMIZED THREE-
STAGE RATE CINTROL ALGORITHM 
 
The block diagram of the proposed JPEG2000 coder 
with perceptually optimized three-stage rate control 
algorithm is shown in Fig. 2.  The color visual model 
is used for estimating the JND profiles of color images 
and a mechanism is used for decomposing the full-band 
JND profiles into component JND profiles.  Through 
the component JND profiles, the perceptually insignifi-
cant wavelet coefficients in three color channels are 
removed first and the perceptible distortion is defined to

The major advantage of our method over PCRD and 
PSOT [1] is that our method has the least complexity 
and the image quality obtained by our method is close 
to that obtained by PCRD method. 
 
4. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
Our proposed method is tested on six 512 × 512 test 
images including “Sail,” “Lena,” “Pepper,” “Baboon,” 
“Goldhill,” “F16”.  In all images, we use the integer 
(5,3) filter with three-level DWT decomposition and the 
code block size is 64 × 64.  In all methods, the MSE is 
replaced by the perceptual distortion to achieve a per-
ceptually optimized image codec.  
 
4.1 Fidelity Measure Criterion 
In the experiments, we regard the PSNR, PSPNR, 
memory usage and complexity as the fidelity measure 
criterion. 
To access the perceptual quality of the reconstructed 
image, an effective criterion is needed.  The Mean 
Squared Error (MSE) and perk signal-to-noise ratio 
(PSNR) defined in Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) are widely 
used to measure the image quality.

where p(i,j) and pr(i,j) denote original and reconstructed 
pixel at (i,j).  H and W are the height and width of 
original image. 
Unfortunately, PSNR can not accurately reflect the 
real perceptual quality of the reconstructed image.  
Consequently, a quantitative fidelity measure that is 
conformable to the subjectively measure has been de-
fined to evaluate the quality of the reconstructed image 
in terms of the perceptible distortion energy.  In this 
measure, perceptible distortion is referred to the part by 
which the distortion is noticeable or the part of distor-
tion that exceeds the visibility threshold given by the 
JND profile.  Two new fidelity criterions, as termed 
by mean squared perceptible error (MSPE) and peak 
signal-to-perceptible noise ratio (PSPNR) , are defined 
as：

where JND(i,j) represents the JND level at (i,j).  p(i,j) 
and pr(i,j) denote original and reconstructed pixel at (i,j), 
respectively. 
Therefore, for an original and reconstructed image of 
fixed PSNR, the average level of the JND profile in-
creases with the increasing viewing distance, and so 
does the associated PSPNR.  That is, larger distortion 
can be tolerated for human perception as the viewing 
distance increases. 
 
4.2 Experimental Results 
Simulation results show that the proposed method 
provides different tradeoff among visual quality, com-
putational complexity and memory usage.  In the ex-
periments, all methods use perceptible distortion for 
comparing in the same condition.  In following section, 
we show some comparisons between the proposed 
method, the PCRD method and the Oscar’s method [15] 
in visual quality, computational complexity and mem-
ory usage.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
This paper presents a perceptually optimized rate 
control method for JPEG2000 coding of color images.  
By using the proposed method, the complexity and 
memory usage are reduced indeed.  The basic idea of 
our method is to allocate coding bits to each code block 
according to the associated perceptual significance.
