Abstract 
 JKR, DMT and Maugis-Dugdale model have 
been used in micro/nano adhesive contact.  
However, the accuracies of these three models have 
not been investigated in detail. This research use 
numerical analyses investigate the accuracies of these 
three models.

1. Introduction 
 Bradley [1] found that the pull-off force 
between two rigid spheres of radii, 1R  and 2R  is 
γpiR2 , where 21 /1/1/1 RRR +=  and γ  is the 
surface energy.  In 1971, Johnson, Kendall and 
Robert considered the energy balance and proposed 
the JKR model [2].  In JKR model, the deformation 
near the rim of the contact area was considered.  
JKR model predicts a pull-off force of γpiR)2/3( .  
On the other hand, in 1975, Derjaguin, Muller and 
Toporov [3] proposed the DMT model, where Hertz 
contact is assumed inside the contact area.  They 
took into account the adhesive force, but ignored the 
deformation outside the contact area.  DMT model 
predicts a pull-off force of γpiR2 .  In 1977, Tabor 
[4] proposed a parameter (the Tabor parameter, µ ) 
and clarified the discrepancy between JKR and DMT 
models.  The Tabor parameter can be interpreted as 
the ratio of the elastic deformation to the range of 
action of the adhesive forces.  Thus, the JKR model 
applies to large, compliant spheres ( ∞→µ ), while 
the DMT model applies to small, stiff spheres 
( 0→µ ).  In 1992, Maugis [5] using Dugdale 
model, gave an analytical analysis for the transition 
between JKR and DMT models. 
Numerical analysis for the adhesive contact 
between elastic spheres was firstly proposed by 
Muller et. al. [6] in 1980.  They presented a 
numerical computation with Lennard-Jones potential, 
and showed that the transition from DMT to JKR 
pull-off forces occurred with increasing Tabor 
parameter.  The complete numerical solution was 
done by Greenwood [7] and Feng [8, 9].  
Greenwood pointed that [7, 10], as Tabor parameter 
decreases from ∞  to 0, the adhesive contact is 
transited from JKR model to Bradley model 
(rigid-sphere model), not DMT model. 
Using numerical simulation, this research will 
investigate the accuracies of JKR model, DMT and 
Maugis-Dugdale model.  Since JKR model is 
accurate, this report consists of two parts for DMT 
and Maugis-Dugdale model.  Each part has its own 
governing equations and results.

2.2. Adhesive Contact 
2.2.1 The Adhesive Contact 
The contact between two elastic spheres will be 
regarded as a contact between an elastic, deformable 
sphere and a rigid half-space. 
  
Figure 1. A  vs. W . 
First of all, adhesive contacts for =µ 0.01, 0.1, 
1, 5 are simulated, which are compared with JKR, 
DMT and Hertz contact.  Figure 1 shows the A  vs. 
W .  Figure 2 shows the W  vs. C .  These figures 
appeared in Greenwood and Feng’s paper before 
[7-9].  In figure 2, for the JKR type of contact 
( =µ 1, 5), the edge of the contact area is taken as the 
point where the tensile force is maximum.  For the 
DMT type of contact ( =µ 0.01), the contact area is 
taken as where there is positive pressure. 
From figures 1 and 2, it is found that, as µ  is 
large, the adhesive contact approaches JKR model.  
But, for small µ , the adhesive contact is quite 
different from DMT model. 
 
Figure 2. W  vs. C . 
  
Figure 3. A  vs. W . 
Figure 3 shows the A  vs. W .  This figure 
was shown in Feng’s paper [8] before.  It is found 
that as µ  is small, the adhesive contact is similar to 
rigid-sphere contact.  This is the same as 
Greenwood’s conclusion [10].  In contact between 
rigid spheres, the load W  is a function of A . 
From the above results, it is shown that DMT 
model is wrong.  However, the rigid contact can 
work only for ε<A , otherwise, there is interference.  
 5 
 
for macro-mechanics, where the distance between the 
sphere and the half-space is ε .  The profile of the 
adhesive Hertz contact is similar to that of Hertz 
contact.  But the distance between the sphere and 
the half-space is less than ε . 
 
Figure 7. Adhesive contact for =µ 0.01, =A 2 
This can be explained easily.  When ≥µ 1, the 
repulsive force is large enough, and can sustain the 
contact area near =A 0.  But when Tabor parameter 
is small, the repulsive force is small.  The repulsive 
force cannot sustain the contact area around =A 0.  
The gap between the sphere and the half-space 
becomes smaller than ε . 
 
2.3.1 New Hertz model 
Now, we define the flat part of the deformed 
sphere as the contact area.  In fact, the flat part is 
only approximately flat.  In the center of the contact 
area, the distance between the sphere and the rigid 
half-space is smaller.  In the edge of the contact area, 
the distance is larger.  It is reasonable to define the 
contact depth CH  at half the maximum pressure. 
The profile for adhesive Hertz contact is similar 
to that of Hertz contact.  The repulsive force can 
sustain the sphere at CH .  Thus, we can assume a 
“new Hertz contact”, which has the same contact 
force and contact area as the Hertz contact, but the 
contact occurs at CH . 
Figure 8 shows the pressure distribution for the 
“adhesive Hertz contact” and the “new Hertz 
contact”. 
Suppose the load of the “new Hertz contact” is 
CW .  The contact plane is at CH .  The contact 
area at this plane is CC .  For this contact plane, the 
approach is CA .  Thus,

The approach A  between two spheres is

transition from rigid-sphere model to JKR model. 
 
Figure 13. W  vs. C  for adhesive contact, 
=µ 0.01 
In the current research, it is found that when 
Tabor parameter is small, rigid-sphere model is 
correct for small approach and small load, which is 
predicted by Greenwood.  As the load increases, the 
rigid contact is transited to “new DMT model”. 
In DMT model, Hertz contact is assumed inside 
the contact area.  In the current research, it is found 
that adhesive Hertz contact is different from Hertz 
contact.  If Hertz contact is replaced by adhesive 
Hertz contact, DMT model (which becomes “new 
DMT model”) is not far from the real adhesive 
contact. 
 
2.4.2 Contact radius 
 From figure 7, it is not easy to define the contact 
area.  The contact area can be taken where there is 
positive pressure.  The contact area can also be 
defined as the flat part.  But what is the edge of flat 
part?  And which is the correct definition?  
Greenwood [10] argued that the definition of contact 
radius is a problem of philosophy. 
In Enacheuscu et. al.’s experiments [12], the 
voltage and sliding force are used to verify the 
contact area of JKR and DMT model.  The 
definition of contact radius should depend on its 
application.  If contact thermal conductivity is 
concerned, the contact area should be defined by heat 
conduction.  If sliding force is concerned, the 
contact area should be defined by friction.

where )(cos µ ′W  and )(µ ′wuW  can be obtained by

equations (20) and (12), the approach-load relation 
can be obtained. 
 The approach ∆  vs. load W  for  =′µ 0.5

equation (20) is a better approximation of the load for 
Feng’s numerical simulation than equation (14).

3.3.3 Contact Radius for Zero Load 
 For Maugis-Dugdale model, by setting =W 0 
of equation (14), the contact radius 0A  can be found.  
Carpick et. al. [15] found that the contact radius 0A

Solving equation (22) and (12) simultaneously, a 
contact radius A  for zero load can be obtained. 
But, from figure 15, it is found that the 
maximum tensile pressure occurs around one third 
between A  and C . The contact radius is

Figure 18. µ ′  vs. 0A  
 In numerical simulation, it is not easy to define 
the contact radius since two surfaces never contact.  
There are two definitions for contact radius [9].  The 
first is where there is positive pressure.  The second 
is where the tensile stress takes the maximum value.  
Using these two definitions, the Tabor parameter vs. 
contact radius at 0=W  are shown in figure 6 and 7.  
It is found that wuA  can predict the contact radius 
for >′µ 0.8 for the second definition of contact 
radius.  Equation (21) does not predict any of them. 
 From figure 18, equation (21) approximates the 
contact radius transmitted from JKR to DMT model.  
Equation (23) approximates the contact radius from 
JKR to Bradley.  As Greenwood pointed out [10, 
13], as µ ′  decreases from ∞  to 0, the adhesive 
contact is transited from JKR model to Bradley 
model.  Thus, equation (23) is more accurate than 
equation (21). 
 
4. Conclusion 
 The accuracies of JKR, DMT and 
Maugis-Dugdale model are analyzed.  JKR is 
accurate.  But there are errors in DMT and 
Maugis-Dugdale models.  Modifications are 
proposed to correct the error.
