methods [7-10]. The hardness of the 
synthesized c-BC2N is higher than that of 
c-BN single crystals and only slightly less 
hard than diamond [10]. In addition, several 
studies focus on spectra and structural 
models [11, 12]. Recently, most of the BCN 
coatings were deposited by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) processes from different 
organic precursors [13-15]. In most cases, 
however, only soft phases have been 
obtained. Other deposition techniques have 
been attempted by physical vapor deposition 
(PVD) methods, such as sputtering [16-18], 
ion beam deposition and laser ablation 
[19-20]. However, the synthesis of pure 
cubic BCN films with a structure similar to 
that of diamond or c-BN is still under 
development. 
The result of Krannich’s 
investigation [21] showed that 100% c-BN 
films could be deposited by using reactive 
cathodic arc evaporation. The films were 
deposited while operating a heated boron arc 
evaporation source in a nitrogen 
environment. In this study, the cathodic arc 
plasma method with a complex target 
composed of graphite and B4C was used to 
deposit the BCN films. The composition, 
binding states and characteristics of the films 
prepared at different conditions were 
investigated with various instruments. 
2. Experimental Procedure 
 Boron carbon nitride (BCN) thin 
films were deposited on Si(100) substrates 
by reactive cathodic arc evaporation from 
graphite and B4C composite targets. The 
Ar+N2 (phase 1) or Ar/N2/H2 (phase 2) gases 
were added to the deposition atmosphere                                                   
under pressure of 0.1-0.3 Pa. The deposition 
parameters included the substrate bias, the 
flow rate and ratio of the reactive gases 
having been varied. 
Microstructure of the BCN films has 
been characterized by field emission 
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), 
atomic force microscopy (AFM), 
transmission electron microscope (TEM) and 
low angle X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger 
electron spectroscopy (AES) were employed 
to analyses the composition of the films. 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used 
to investigate the spectrum and bonding 
states of films. Atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) was used to determine the 
morphology and to measure the surface 
roughness of the films. Nanoindentation 
tester equipped to AFM was employed to 
determine the nanohardness and the elastic 
module of the films. 
3. Results and Discussio 
3.1 Phase 1 
3.1.1 Microstructure and nanohardness 
     The typical FESEM morphologies of 
the as-deposited BCN films are shown in Fig. 
1. Figure 1 (b) shows the higher 
magnification of Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 1 (c) 
shows the cross-sectional images of the BCN 
coatings. The films revealed a 
cauliflower-like microstructure. No 
macroparticles were found in Fig. 1 (a) and 
(b).  Figure 2 shows the typical AFM 
surface morphologies of BCN Film. The 
deposition time was 8 min, while the bias 
employed in the films of Fig. 2(a) and (b) 
were -200V and -400V respectively. The 
surface roughness (RMS) of the Fig. 2(a) 
and (b) was 40nm and 20nm respectively, 
this implies that the surface roughness was 
decreased with the increase of deposition 
bias. The nanoindentation test shows the 
nanohardness of the films ranging 1-3 GPa, 
Er value ranging 30-108 GPa. The AFM 
surface morphology of a sample after 
nanoindentation test was shown in Fig. 2 (c), 
which shows a clear nanoindentation mark 
implying the results are reliable. 
Solozhenko’s study showed that the 
nanohardness of the synthesized c-BC2N is 
75 GPa [10]. The hardness values of the 
films are still low in this study. Further 
studies about the effects of parameters 
(especially added gases and bias) on the 
hardness are needed.  
      Figure 3 shows the typical TEM 
micrograph of BCN films, the films revealed 
an amorphous microstructure. The film 
adhered well to the silicon substrate even 
after being broken mechanically.  
 6
188.4 eV, respectively [6, 24, 25], the signal 
at the lower energy side indicates a 
contribution of B-C bonding. It has been 
shown that the binding energy due to B-O 
bond is 192 eV [24, 25]. As shows in Fig. 8 
(a), for the as-deposited sample (sputtering 
time: 0 sec), the B1s consisted almost B-O 
bonding with a small amount of B-N 
bonding. After 60 sec and 180 sec sputtering, 
the intensity of B-N bonding and B-C 
bonding was increased. The high B-O 
intensity of the as-deposited sample may 
result from the contamination by oxygen and 
moisture before XPS analysis. 
 . The spectra for C1s of the BCN 
films are shown in Fig. 8 (b). The binding 
energy of 284.4 eV can be assigned to C-C 
bonding. The broadening of the spectra 
indicates also the existence of other chemical 
bonds. According to the previous studies [6, 
13, 24, 25], the intensity at the lower energy 
side is due to B-C bonding (283 eV). Besides, 
the shoulder of the spectra at higher energy 
side is assigned to C-N bonding (286.4 eV). 
However, the C-O bond located at 288.5 eV 
is not obvious. Fig. 8 (b) also revealed that 
the intensity of B-C bonding was increased 
after sputtering, while the intensity of C-C 
bonding decreased. 
The XPS spectrum for N1s electrons 
is shown in Fig. 8 (c). The FWHM was 
approximately more than 2 eV. The peak 
with energy of 398.5 eV is in accordance 
with B-N bonding. The binding energy of 
C-N bonds in BCN films has been reported 
to be approximately 399.3 eV [13]. Previous 
studies [13, 26] also show that a peak at 
400.8 eV and a peak at 401.8 eV [26] are 
attributed to absorbed nitrogen and N-O 
bonds, respectively. Tabbal et al. [27] 
suggested the peak energy at 402.0 eV of CN 
film is probably due to some contamination 
by air exposure. Therefore, the shoulder at 
higher energy side implies the formation of 
C-N bonds, N-O bonds and/or the existence 
of absorbed nitrogen. Fig. 8 (c) also revealed 
that for the as-deposited sample (etching 
time: 0 sec), the N1s spectrum consisted 
almost of N-O and C-N bonding with a small 
amount of B-N bonding. After 60 sec and 
180 sec sputtering etching, the intensity of 
B-N bonding and C-N bonding was 
increased. The high intensity between 400 
eV and 402 eV of the as-deposited sample 
may have resulted from the nitrogen trapped 
during deposition processes and the 
contamination by oxygen and moisture 
before XPS analysis. 
The XPS spectrum for O1s electrons 
is shown in Fig. 8 (d). Even after 60sec and 
180 sec, the O1s intensity still can be 
detected. The oxygen concentration of the 
as-deposited sample and sputtered samples 
(60sec and 180 sec sputtering) were 23 at. % 
and 9 at. % respectively. From Fig. 8 (a), (b) 
and (c), the B-O, C-O and N-O chemical 
bonds can be identified from the spectra. 
This implies that the oxygen concentration in 
the films beneath the surface was still high.  
In summary, the results of all specimens are 
about the same. The B-N, B-C and C-N 
chemical bonds can be detected from the 
XPS spectra. Thus it can be concluded that 
the film is a compound with B-C-N atomic 
hybridization, rather than a simple mixture 
of graphite and BN.  
3.1 Phase 2 
3.2.1 Microstructure 
The typical FESEM morphologies of the 
as-deposited BCN films are shown in Fig. 9. 
The films revealed a cracked microstructure. 
Severe macroparticles with size raging from 
submicron to ten micron were found in Fig. 
9 (a) and (b). Figure 10 shows the low angle 
XRD patterns of three selected samples 
deposited with different parameters. In all 
cases, the patterns of (BN)0.33C0.67, B4C and 
B2O3 were found.  
3.2.2 Spectra analyses 
Figure 11 shows the Raman spectra 
of the BCN films deposited with various 
parameters. All the spectra in this phase 
were similar except the spectrum of BCN32 
present a luminescence background and the 
D-band and G-band were not found. In other 
spectra in Fig. 11 , two distinguishable D (D 
means disorder, approximately centered at 
1355 cm-1) and G (G means graphitic, 
approximately centered at 1580 cm-1) bands 
and a very broad asymmetric bands centered 
at 2910 cm-1 are found.  The band centered 
at 2910 cm-1 is attributed to the second order 
Raman scattering of D and G bands. It is
