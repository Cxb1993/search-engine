paths on hierarchical hypercube networks,” Inform. Sciences 177, 4200-4207.
The hierarchical hypercube network is suitable for massively parallel systems.
An appealing property of this network is the low number of connections per proces-
sor, which can enhance the VLSI design and fabrication of the system. Other alluring
features include symmetry and logarithmic diameter, which imply easy and fast algo-
rithms for communication. In this paper, a maximal number of node-disjoint paths are
constructed between every two distinct nodes of the hierarchical hypercube network.
Their maximal length is not greater than max{2m+1 + 2m+ 1, 2m+1 +m+ 4}, where
2m+1 is diameter. Furthermore, we also show that the lower bound of node-disjoint
paths in hierarchical hypercube network is at least 2m+1 + 1.

hierarchical hypercube networks,” Inform. Process. Letters 109, 112-115.
The hierarchical hypercube network, which was proposed as an alternative to
the hypercube, is suitable for building a large-scale multiprocessor system. A bipartite
graph G = (V,E) is bipancyclic if it contains cycles of all even lengths ranging from 4
to |V |. In this paper, we show that the hierarchical hypercube network is bipancyclic.
[189] G. J. Chang, J. Wu and X. Zhu (2010), “Rainbow domination on trees,” Disc.
Appl. Math. 158, 8-12.
This paper studies a variation of domination in graphs called rainbow domina-
tion. For a positive integer k, a k-rainbow dominating function of a graph G is a
function f from V (G) to the set of all subsets of {1, 2, . . . , k} such that for any vertex
v with f(v) = ∅ we have ∪u∈NG(v)f(u) = {1, 2, . . . , k}. The 1-rainbow domination is
the same as the ordinary domination. The k-rainbow domination problem is to de-
termine the k-rainbow domination number γrk(G) of a graph G, that is the minimum
value of
∑
v∈V (G) |f(v)| where f runs over all k-rainbow dominating functions of G.
In this paper, we prove that the k-rainbow domination problem is NP-complete even

NP-completeness results are also investigated.
[190] C.-H. Liu and G. J. Chang, “Roman domination on 2-connected graphs,”
submitted to SIAD.
A Roman dominating function of a graph G is a function f : V (G) → {0, 1, 2}
such that whenever f(v) = 0, there exists a vertex u adjacent to v such that f(u) = 2.
The weight of f is w(f) =
∑
v∈V (G) f(v). The Roman domination number γR(G) of G
is the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function of G. Chambers, Kinnersley,
Prince and West [?] conjectured that γR(G) ≤ d2n/3e for any 2-connected graph G
of n vertices. This paper gives counter-examples to the conjecture, and proves that
γR(G) ≤ max{d2n/3e, 23n/34} for any 2-connected graph G of n vertices. We also
characterize 2-connected graphs G for which γR(G) = 23n/34 when 23n/34 > d2n/3e.
[142] C.-C. Lin, G.-H. Chen and G. J. Chang, “An optimal algorithm for finding
locally connected spanning trees on circular-arc graphs,” revising.
Suppose that T is a spanning tree of a graph G. T is called a locally connected
spanning tree of G if for every vertex of T , the set of all its neighbors in T induces a
connected subgraph of G. In this paper, given an intersection model of a circular-arc
graph, an O(n)-time algorithm is proposed that can determine whether the circular-
arc graph contains a locally connected spanning tree or not, and produce one if it
exists.
[145] Y.-Y. Chien and G. J. Chang, “The upper domination of Cartesian products
of graphs,” preparing.
A dominating set of a graph G is a subset D of V (G) such that every vertex
not in D is adjacent to some vertex in D. A dominating set is minimal if none of its
proper subset is a dominating set. The upper domination number Γ(G) of a graph G
is the maximum size of a minimal dominating set of G. This paper confirms a question
proposed by Bresar that Γ(G2H) ≥ Γ(G)Γ(H)+min{|V (G)|−Γ(G), |V (H)|−Γ(H)},
where G2H is the Cartesian product of graphs G and H.
