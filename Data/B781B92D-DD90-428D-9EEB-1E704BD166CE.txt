Abstract 
This study presents a controlled experiment investigating the effects of Interface (iPad/iPhone), 
Keyword (Landmark/District), Chinese Input (Hand-written/Phonetic notation), and Type 
(Electronic Map/Mixed Map) on the user interface satisfaction (UIS) of Google Maps for mobile. 
The individual differences in UIS between gender, the ability of sense of direction (GSD/PSD in 
SODG) and route knowledge (GRK/PRK in RKG) would be examined. The experiment consisted of 
forty-eight participants, each participant was assigned three types of environmental spatial 
tasks—finding the targets, identifying cardinal direction, and identifying qualitative distance. The 
results of the study have verify both the reliability (Cranbach’s α =0.925) and confirmative factor 
analysis (CFA) model of questionnaire of user interface satisfaction (QUIS) are good enough. In 
addition, the interaction effects of Interface*SODG and Interface*RKG as well as the four main 
effects of Type, Keyword, Input, and RKG significantly affect the rating of user satisfaction
（p<0.05）. Sufficient evidences reveal the following: (1) poor SOD (PSD) group using iPad tended 
toward higher UIS than GSD group, but the PSD group using iPhone tended toward lower UIS than 
the GSD group; (2) good RK (GRK) group using either iPad or iPhone tended toward higher UIS 
than PRK group, but the PRK group using iPad tended toward higher UIS than the ones of using 
iPhone.

environment of using a touch screen panel. Two mobile touch devices, a tablet PC （iPad）and a smart 
phone （iPhone 4）, are used to compare the user interface satisfaction via a four-way factorial 
experiment. In this study, a questionnaire of self-rating SOD and paper-and-pencil tests of spatial 
knowledge would be implemented before the experiment. In addition, the effects of four factors 
including Interface (iPad/iPhone), Type (Electronic Map/Mixed Map), Keyword (Landmark/District), 
and Input (Hand-written/Phonetic notation) on user interface satisfaction (UIS) would be examined to 
provide an optimal user-centered interface for GMM. 
Method 
2.1 Participants 
Forty-eight undergraduate, graduate students, teaching assistants and staffs (24 females and 24 males) 
voluntarily participated in the experiment. Their ages ranged from 20.7 to 39.7 years old, with a mean of 
23.7 years and standard deviation of 3.5 years. Nine out of Forty-eight participants had experience using 
other mobile E-map rather than GMM before the experiment. They all had normal vision or corrected 
vision reaching at least 0.8 and no color-blindness. The requirement to be a participant is to leave alone 
PC more than one hour before the formal experiment. 
2.2 Materials and Apparatus 
There is an iPad with 9.7-inches multi-touch LCD display (1024×768 pixels) as the representative of the 
tablet PC and an iPhone with 3.5 inches multi-touch retina display (960×640 pixels). Optical Vision 
Tester is used to measure vision acuity and examine the color blindness. A digital video camera recorder 
(SONY DCR-PC330) is used to record the overall process of experiments and after-experiment 
questionnaire. In addition, the luminance of experimental lab is 487~611 lux measured by Lutron 
LX-101 Lux meter.  
2.3 Sense of Direction 
Based on Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD) [5], 10 questions of spatial and navigation 
using Likert’s seven-point scale were self-rated before the formal experiment. Participants rated each 
question by circling a number ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Four out of ten 
questions are stated positively, e.g., “My sense of direction is very good,” “I am very good at reading 
maps.” The other six questions are stated negatively, e.g., “I have a poor memory for where I left 
things,” “I very easily get lost in a new city.” The answers will be reversed to positive statement so that a 
higher score means a better SOD. The self-rating of sense of direction (SOD) is calculated by summing 
up ten SOD questions as SOD score and then categorized into two groups as SODG using the median of 
SOD: good SOD (GSD) and poor SOD (PSD). In addition, participants would take paper-and-pencil 
tests of route knowledge (RK) before the experiment. Their RK scores were recorded and categorized 
into two groups as RKG: good RK (GRK) and poor RK (PRK) based on the test result of route 
knowledge. 
2.4 Design of Experiment 
This study would like to provide an analytical model of usability of GMM interface using touch screen 
panels. The usability of GMM interface was evaluated using questionnaire of user interface satisfaction 
(QUIS) after the experiment of completing three wayfinding tasks. Four-way factorial design is 
implemented to assign each participant all three kinds of wayfinding tasks and then an after-experiment 
interview via the questionnaire of user interface satisfaction is anticipated to collect the UIS ratings. 
Controllable factors consist of four design factors, including: (1) Interface: tablet PC (iPad) vs. smart

Conclusions 
The summaries made by the results of user interface satisfaction as following: (1) Most GMM users 
prefer using iPad to iPhone; (2) User satisfaction of SODG depends on the interface of GMM. Poor 
SOD (PSD) group prefers using iPad to iPhone; (3) User satisfaction of RKG also depends on the 
interface of GMM. Poor RK (PRK) group prefers using iPad to iPhone. Good RK (GRK) group would 
have higher UIS than the ones of PRK. The results of quantitative measurements and subjective 
assessments would be used as the guidelines to meet the demands of usability for mobile map 
applications.

including Size, Type, Direction Key, and Zoom function has 
been examined in [11]. The results indicate that participants 
with a better SOD would have the faster response time and 
would lower overall workload for target task. However, 
mobile maps differ from paper maps in that it provides a 
facilitation of spatial search. Keyword search using landmark 
or district and Chinese input methods using traditional 
Chinese hand-written input or traditional Chinese phonetic 
notation keyboard input for GMM spatial queries are 
concentrated on this research.  
In this paper we discuss user interface satisfaction (UIS) 
that arose in using GMM on mobile devices with a touch 
screen interface such as the iPhone and iPad. This study 
differs from previous studies [7,10,11,12,15] in that it 
concentrates on the effects of keyword search and Chinese 
input methods that affect UIS. We first present our 
experimental design, including a description of the interfaces 
evaluated. Four design factors (Interface, Type, Keyword, 
Input) and two background factors (SOD and route 
knowledge) on UIS were examined. It helps Apps designers 
to provide an optimal user-centered interface for GMM. We 
follow with a description of our research methodology, 
define a classification scheme of SOD used in our analysis, 
and then present the results. The paper concludes with a 
discussion of design implications followed by future work. 
II. METHOD  
A. Participants  
Forty-eight undergraduate, graduate students, teaching 
assistants and staff (24 females and 24 males) voluntarily 
participated in the experiment. Their ages ranged from 20.7 
to 39.7 years old, with a mean of 23.7 years and standard 
deviation of 3.5 years. Nine out of Forty-eight participants 
had experience in using mobile E-maps other than GMM, 
before the experiment. They all had normal vision or 
corrected vision of at least 0.8 and no color-blindness. 
Participants were required to abstain from PC use for one 
hour before the formal experiment. 
B. Materials and Apparatus 
The experiment used an iPad with a 9.7-inches multi-
touch LCD display (1024× 768 pixels) as a representative 
tablet PC and an iPhone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch retina 
display (960×640 pixels). An Optical Vision Tester was used 
to measure vision acuity and to test for color blindness. A 
digital video camera recorder (SONY DCR-PC330) was 
used to record the experiments and the post-experiment 
questionnaire. The luminance of experimental lab was 
487~611 lux, as measured by a Lutron LX-101 Lux meter. 
C. Sense of Direction 
Using the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale 
(SBSOD) [5], 10 questions concerning spatial awareness and 
navigation allowed self-rating, using Likert’s seven-point 
scale, before the formal experiment. Participants responded 
to each question by circling a number ranging from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Four out of ten 
statements were positive, e.g., “My sense of direction is very 
good,” “I am very good at reading maps.” The other six 
statements were negative, e.g., “I have a poor memory for 
where I left things,” “I very easily get lost in a new city.” 
These responses were reversed so that a higher score 
indicated a better SOD. The rating for SOD is calculated by 
summation of the scores for the ten SOD questions, as a 
SOD score and then these scores were categorized into two 
groups as SODG, using the median SOD as the divider for 
good SOD (GSD) and poor SOD (PSD). In addition, 
participants sat paper-and-pencil tests for route knowledge 
(RK), before the experiment. Their RK scores were recorded 
and categorized into two groups as RKG: good RK (GRK) 
and poor RK (PRK), based on the test result for route 
knowledge. 
D. Design of Experiment 
This study seeks to provide an analytical model of 
usability of a GMM interface was evaluated using touch 
screen panels. The usability of the GMM interface was 
evaluated using a questionnaire for user interface satisfaction 
(QUIS), upon completion of three route-finding tasks. A 
four-way factorial design was used to assign each participant 
all three types of route-finding tasks to each participant and 
then a post-experiment questionnaire was used to determine 
user interface satisfaction. The four design factors consisted 
of: (1) Interface: tablet PC (iPad) vs. smart phone (iPhone), 
(2) Type: Electronic map (E-Map) vs. mixed map (M-Map, 
that is, E-map plus satellite), (3) Keyword: use landmark as 
keyword (Landmark) vs. use district (District), and (4) Input: 
traditional Chinese hand-written input (hand-written) vs. 
traditional Chinese phonetic notation keyboard input 
(phonetic notation). The illustration of the factors Type and 
Input is shown in Fig. 1. Demographical variables consisted 
of: (1) gender, (2) route knowledge (GRK/PRK), and (3) 
sense of direction (GSD/PSD). Forty-eight participants (24 
female and 24 male) participated in this experiment. Three 
route-finding tasks were assigned to each participant; (1) find 
targets, (2) identify cardinal directions and (3) identify the 
approximate distances. Cardinal directions were based on 8-
sectors model (North, East, South, West, North-East, South-
East, South-West and North-West), while approximate 
distances corresponded to a set of ordered intervals, where 
the order of symbolic distance values describes distances 
from the nearest to the furthest [6]. The time to correctly 
complete the target task, the time to correctly complete the 
direction task and the time to correctly complete the distance 
task using a GMM interface were measured (omitted due to 
limitation of paper length). 
The study areas were northern, central and southern 
metropolitan district of Taiwan, in Taipei, Taichung, and 
Kaohsiung Cities, respectively. The participants all started 
from the same point. The mapped area was dynamically 
updated as the user moved in space. 
E. Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) 
The questionnaire for user interface satisfaction (QUIS) 
is a structured assessment of usability. It is useful in the early 
stages of the development of a user-centered design. The 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines 
23Copyright (c) IARIA, 2012.     ISBN: 978-1-61208-177-9
ACHI 2012 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions
maps must provide information that is necessary and 
sufficient to make the right choice at each decision point [16]. 
Agrawala and Stolte [17] argue that for maps on mobile 
devices it is particularly important that the routes are 
simplified and extra information is removed. It is consistent 
with our study that E-map has superior UIS than M-map. 
Reliability of the questionnaire was tested on 532 
undergraduates as participants using internal consistency and 
split-half methods in Kato and Takeuchi’s study [9]. A 
moderately high reliability was obtained. Similarly, both the 
reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) and confirmative factor 
analysis model of the questionnaire for user interface 
satisfaction are good enough in this study. However, only 
forty-eight participates used in the experiment.  
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The results of this study have implications for mobile 
spatial interaction in general. Most GMM users prefer using 
E-map to M-Map. They also prefer using landmark as 
keyword to district and prefer using traditional Chinese 
hand-written input method to traditional phonetic notation 
input. The poor SOD (PSD) group prefers using iPad to 
iPhone. The poor RK (PRK) group prefers using iPad to 
iPhone and the good RK (GRK) group has a higher UIS than 
the PRK group. It is also important to integrate the impact of 
the design factors and individual differences on the user 
performance of mobile spatial interaction. The results of 
quantitative measurements and subjective assessments will 
be used as the guidelines to provide a better solution and to 
meet the demands of usability for mobile spatial interaction 
applications.
