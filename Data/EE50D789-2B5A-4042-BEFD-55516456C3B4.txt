二、英文摘要 
This project investigates the feasibility of remote 
frequency control using the IEEE 1588 standard, a 
precision time synchronization protocol (PTP). 
Within a subnet, for an averaging time of one day, the 
presented PTP system can achieve the time stability 
of a few nanoseconds as well as the frequency 
stability of a few parts in 1013. By integrating the PTP 
system, fuzzy controller, D/A converter and other 
components, the proposed system can steer a remote 
oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) to 
syntonize with a primary cesium atomic clock used as 
the master clock of the PTP system. Experimental 
results show that, over a measurement period of one 
day, the frequency stability of the OCXO can be 
improved from a few parts in 1010 to about 51013.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Measurement and control systems are widely 
used in traditional test and measurement, industrial 
automation, communication systems, electrical power 
systems and many other areas of modern technology. 
Precise time and frequency sources play important 
roles in these measurement and control systems 
[1]-[5]. The timing requirements for primary 
reference sources (PRS) in the telecommunication 
networks are given in [6]. For PRS, the maximum 
allowable fractional frequency offset for observation 
times greater than one week is 110-11 over all 
applicable operational conditions. The expensive 
high-performance rubidium or cesium clock may be 
adopted in order to meet the requirements for PRS. 
Other frequency sources (FSs) such as quartz or 
rubidium, which are placed on traditional 
measurement and control systems, must be both 
routinely and off-line calibrated in calibration 
laboratories so that they remain within the tolerance 
required by the user’s applications. In addition, FSs 
used for calibration laboratories must be traced to 
national or international standards. IEEE 1588 
addresses the clock synchronization requirements of 
measurement and control systems. It is a protocol 
designed to synchronize real-time clocks in the nodes 
of a distributed system that communicate using a 
network [7]. This study implements a PTP system 
using two IEEE 1588 interfaces. Within a subnet, for 
a measurement period of one day, the PTP system can 
achieve the time stability of a few nanoseconds as 
well as the frequency stability of a few parts in 1013. 
By integrating the PTP system, fuzzy controller, D/A 
converter and other components, this work can steer a 
remote oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) to 
syntonize with a primary cesium atomic clock used as 
the master clock of the PTP system. The performance 
of the remote OCXO can be improved more than two 
orders of magnitude. 
The following section gives an overview of the 
IEEE 1588 standard and describes the fuzzy controller. 
Section 3 presents the system architecture. The 
experimental results are illustrated in Section 4. Finally, 
the concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

This work adopt max and algebraic product 
composition, then the inferred output of each rule is a 
fuzzy set scaled down by its firing strength via 
algebraic product. With centroid of area (COA) 
defuzzification, the overall output u can be derived 
below [9]. The overall output is then scaled by means 
of the factor Kout to produce a crisp control signal.

III. SYHSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
Fig. 4 depicts the functional block diagram of the 
proposed system [1]. It consists of the master station 
and the remote station. The master station contains a 
PC with PTP interface and a cesium atomic clock, 
which is used as the master clock of the PTP system. 
The 10 MHz of the cesium clock is connected to the 
PTP interface. The remote station includes an 
inexpensive OCXO, a D/A converter and a PC with 
PTP interface.

In order to estimate the offset of the remote clock 
with respect to the primary clock, this work connects 
the master clock to the PTP interface. The slave clock 
of the PTP system is then synchronized with the 
master clock over packet network such that it can 
generate synchronized clock and trigger 1PPS signal. 
In the remote station, the frequency offsets between 
the slave clock and the OCXO are measured by a 
time interval counter (TIC). The frequency offset 
y (ti) and its change y (ti) ( y (ti)  y (ti1)) are 
chosen as the input variables of the fuzzy controller. 
The output of the controller is used to generate an 
incremental voltage V (ti) to update the voltage 
Vi+1 (=Vi +V )  for steering the oscillator. Through a 
D/A converter, the remote clock is then steered to 
synchronize with the primary clock. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Fig. 4 displays the basic experimental structure 
for testing. A subnet of network was established by 
integrating a switch, two PCs and two PTP interface 
cards. In the master station, the 10 MHz of the 
cesium clock (HP5071A) used as master clock was 
connected to the PTP interface (NI PCI-1588). The 
OCXO (FTS 1130) was used as the remote clock. The 
study used the LabVIEW for programming the PTP 
interfaces. The software including the fuzzy 
controller, communication interfaces and data 
collection were programmed in MATLAB. The data 
used for frequency accuracy and stability analysis 
were measured every one second by TIC (SR620). In 
addition, for the stability analysis of the frequency 
source under tests, this study utilized the ITU-T 
recommended modified Allan deviation (MDEV) 
[10][11]. In our experiment, the confidence intervals 
applied to the frequency stability analysis were set to 
the  1 (68%) error bars at  1 y () N , where N 
is the number of frequency data points used to 
calculate the Allan deviation. 
To assess the limitations of the proposed PTP 
system regarding frequency syntonization, this study 
conducted a common clock test. The original internal 
quartz oscillators in the two PTP interfaces in both 
stations were replaced. By the help of coupling 
capacitors, a common high-performance cesium 
clock (HP5071A) could be connected to the PTP 
interfaces. The frequency stability analyses are shown 
in Fig. 5. These results show that the PTP system has 
a high frequency stability of a few parts in 1013 for an 
averaging time of one day. Fig. 6 indicates the time 
stability analysis of the proposed system. It depicts 
that the PTP system can achieve high time stability of 
a few nanoseconds over a measurement period of one 
day. 
From the Fig. 5, the PTP system reveals high 
frequency stability over averaging times greater than 
2000 s, while the short-term performance is limited 
due to variations in network delay, caused by jitter 
mainly introduced by intermediate networking 
devices such as hubs and switches. For this reason, a 
measurement period of at least 2000 s is 
recommended when controlling an inexpensive 
OCXO using the PTP system.

OCXO under control is more unstable than the 
free-running one over a measurement interval of [4s, 
400s]. The results may be attributed to the network 
delay. To overcome this problem, an optimum 
controller still remains to be developed. 
From the present results obtained, the long-term 
performance of the OCXO can be significantly 
improved under normal circumstances. In reality, the 
reference signal may be lost for various reasons. A 
short network outage or invalid of reference source 
may have little impact on the performance of the 
OCXO. However, the longer the outage, the more 
serious the degradation of the stability will gradually 
increase. A further study will be done on improving 
the performance of the OCXO when the reference 
signal is not available by using the adaptive 
neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) [13]. The 
ANFIS will be used to learn the behavior of the 
OCXO over the phase data under normal operation. 
The information predicted by an ANFIS is then 
applied to steer the OCXO intelligently during 
holdover mode when a reference source is lost to 
maintain its performance with the tolerance required 
by the user’s applications. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This project demonstrates the feasibility of using 
the PTP system for the remote frequency control. The 
preliminary results show that the frequency offsets of 
the OCXO with respect to the slave clock of the PTP 
system can be estimated by performing the linear 
least square fit on the phase differences between both 
clocks over a medium term (e.g. 2000 s) even 
although the PTP system presents large variations 
over short term due to the transit network delay. The 
proposed system may be applicable to networked 
distributed system such as measurement systems, 
electrical power systems, communication networks 
and control systems. 
There is room for further investigation of 
developing an optimum controller to reduce the 
effects on the network delays to improve the 
short-term stability of the OCXO. In addition, this 
study will adopt the ANFIS to keep the performance 
of the OCXO when entering the holdover mode to 
meet the requirements for the user’s applications.
