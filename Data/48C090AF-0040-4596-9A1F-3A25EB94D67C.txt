 Artificial immune algorithm based machine learning model for 
autocorrelated pattern recognition of control charts  
 
 
 
 
Abstract - Control chart pattern recognition is an important aspect of statistical process 
control (SPC). There are many unnatural patterns that may exist in process measurements 
influences the detective capability of control chart, such as sudden shifts, cyclic patterns, 
trends, mixtures, and systematic patterns. The presence of unnatural patterns indicates that a 
process is affected by assignable causes, and corrective actions should be taken. In this paper, 
a support vector machine with the artificial immune algorithm is used for modeling and 
classification. We apply the proposed approach to develop control chart pattern recognizer in 
autocorrelated processes (in AR(1) processes). The performance of the proposed pattern 
recognizer will be evaluated through simulations on the appropriate for measurements. 
Furthermore, four patterns (includes natural patterns) are identified and the rates of 
recognition accuracy are compared. Identification of unnatural patterns can greatly narrow 
the set of possible causes that must be investigated, and thus the diagnostic search could be 
reduced in length.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Statistical process control charts have been widely used for monitoring the quality 
characteristics of manufacturing processes. A process is considered out-of-control if a plotted point 
falls outside the control limits or a series of points exhibit an unnatural pattern (also known as 
nonrandom variation). In practice, there are many unnatural patterns that may occur in 
manufacturing processes indicating out-of-control conditions. The examples of the types of 
unnatural patterns on univariate control charts given in Fig. 1. The typical of unnatural patterns on 
control charts include trends, sudden shifts, mixtures, cyclic patterns, and systematic variation. A 
complete description of these unnatural patterns on control charts can be found in the Statistical 
Quality Control Handbook [1]. 
The growing interest in control chart patterns is due to the fact that unnatural patterns can 
provide valuable information regarding potentialities for process improvement. It is well known that 
a particular unnatural pattern on a control chart is often associated with a specific set of assignable 
causes [1]. Therefore, once any unnatural patterns are recognized, the scope of process diagnosis 
can be greatly narrowed to a small set of possible causes that must be investigated, and thus the 
diagnostic search could be reduced in length.

( dRM  ). In general, antigens and antibodies are considered to be the same length d . The length and 
cell representation depend upon the given problem [16], [17]. Timmis et al. [18] studied the 
advantages of AISs algorithm, that is, clone selection, immune network, and negative selection 
algorithms, respectively. For that reason, the AISs are successful techniques to solve problem fields 
such as classification, regression, clustering, pattern recognition, etc. 
The purpose of this paper is to present an efficient method to improve recognition of control 
chart patterns in autocorrelated processes. An AIS-based machine learning model for control chart 
pattern recognition in AR(1) processes is developed which combines AIS and SVM for 
classification task. 
 
III. METHODOLOGY 
 
A.  Generation of Training Dataset in Autocorrelated Processes 
 
It is well known that the performance of the pattern recognizer is highly dependent on training 
examples. In practice, sufficient training examples of unnatural patterns may not be readily 
available. A common approach adopted by previous researches was to generate training examples 
based on predefined mathematical model [19]. The procedure consisted of the generation of 
autocorrelated process data and unnatural patterns. In the present investigation, the autoregressive 
process of lag 1 (AR(1)) was adopted because it is often found in manufacturing processes. An 
AR(1) process model can be defined by the following equation: 
 ttt XX    )( 1  (1) 
where tX  is the time series observation at time t ,   represents a known process mean of the 
data series, 1tX  is the time series observation at time 1t , t is an independent random noise and   
is autoregressive coefficient restricted to lie between –1 and 1. The Monte Carlo simulation 
approach is used to generate various unnatural patterns. The generator comprise (1) in a 
mathematical formula is expressed below. 
 tttt dtXX    )( 1  (2) 
where tdt  is a special disturbance at time t  that due to assignable cause. An important point to 
note is that the pattern parameters are expressed in terms of X , where X  is defined as

 

X  (3) 
The generations of three types of tdt  are defined as follows. 
(i) Trends. The trends can be expressed as tdt t  , where   is the trend slope. 
(ii) Cycles. The cyclic patterns can be modeled as )/2sin(  tdtt  , where   is the amplitude of the 
cyclic patterns, and the symbol   is defined as the period of the cyclic pattern. 
(iii) Sudden shifts. The sudden shifts can be written as udtt  , where u  represent a parameter to 
determine the occurrence of shifting, the 0u  for non-shifting and 1u  for shifting cases, 
respectively. The quantity   can be defined as the magnitude of the mean shift. 
The parameters used for simulating unnatural patterns are given in Table I. Moreover, we also 
considered AR(1) processes with various positive and negative autocorrelation coefficients to cover 
whole range of parameters for each pattern type. The simulation was implemented using MATLAB 
software [20] in this investigation. For simplicity, all variables were scaled such that each process 
variable has mean zero and variance one.

where iST  is the stimulation threshold for i th class. iARB  is the number of sARB  belonging to 
i th class. The jsl  is the stimulation level of j th ARB  pool of i th class.  
 
(iv) Candidate memory cell merged with initial memory cell. 
After all of the stimulation value in all classes reaches stimulation threshold, the best ARB  in the 
same class with training antigen is taken as a candidate memory cell. Here, the AIS population 
consists of two sub-populations, that is, the initial population and the clone population. 
 
(v) Building the immune network. 
Once the AIS have gone through one training cycle, the weakest 5% of the B cells are removed 
from the AIS. Therefore, the network of B cells expressed more robust than before. 
And further, the proposed approach combines AIS and SVM for pattern recognition. The AIS is 
responsible for clustering, cloning, and mutation the unnatural patterns. The SVM focuses on 
identifying the different patterns promptly and accurately. 
 
(b) Support Vector Machine 
 
The support vector machine method is a new and promising classification and regression 
technique. Recently, support vector machine has been successful applied to solve various real 
problems due to its good generalization performance. The basic idea of applying SVM for solving 
classification problems can be stated briefly in two steps. First, SVM transforms the input space to a 
higher dimensional feature space through a non-linear mapping function. Secondly, it constructs the 
separating hyperplane with maximum distance from the closest points of the training set. It has been 
shown that maximizing the margin of separation improves the generalization ability of the resulting 
classifier. A simple description of the SVM is provided here, please refer to Burges [9] for a 
detailed introduction to the subject. 
For a brief review of SVM, consider the problem of separating the training set Niii y 1)},{( x  with N  
training vectors, where Mi Rx  is the thi  M -dimensional input vector (independent variables), 
}1,1{ iy  is the binary target. The objective is to determine the hyperplane 0)( xf  that separates 
the given data. SVM approximates the separating hyperplane by: 
 0)()( T  bf xwx    (8) 
where vector w  and scalar b  (a bias term) are used to define the position of separating hyperplane. 
Nonlinear function   maps the input vectors into a high-dimensional feature space. The decision 
function is made using sign )(xf  to create separating hyperplane that classify input data in either 
positive class or negative class.  
The training of SVM involves the solution of the following soft margin problem:

The first term 2||||2/1 w  in the objective function attempts to maximize the margin, whereas the 
second term  Ni iC 1 is the sum of training errors. The slack variables i  are introduced to allow for 
some classification errors in the case of non-separable data. The user-specified parameter C  
(penalty factor) determines the degree of penalty assigned to an error. It can be viewed as a tuning 
parameter which can be used to control the trade-off between margin and training error. It should be 
noted that the larger the C , the more the error is penalized. Therefore, C  should be chosen with care 
to avoid over-fitting. Constructing a separating hyperplane in the feature space leads to a non-linear

V. CONCLUSION 
 
The purpose of this paper is to develop an AIS-based machine learning approach to improve 
recognition of control chart patterns in AR(1) processes. The AIS is responsible for clustering, 
cloning, and mutation the unnatural patterns. The SVM focuses on identifying the different patterns 
promptly and accurately. In this work, Simulation results have shown that the AIS-based SVM 
model can give considerable classification improvements. It also states that the proposed approach 
can be used for diagnosis of processes variation and it would be give high classification accuracies.
