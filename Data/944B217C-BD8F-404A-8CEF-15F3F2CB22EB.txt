一、 中文摘要 
傳統上矽半導體為非直接能隙(indirect band 
gap)，故很難製作出高量子效率之發光元件。
而化合物半導體不但擁有直接能隙(indirect 
band gap)可用來作成高效率發光元件如LED、
LD 等，還擁有極高的電子移動率，可用來製
造高速電晶體元件如HEMT，HBT 等。目前的發
光元件皆以化合物半導體為主，即三五族化合
物材料，為了要解決晶片內部傳輸問題，必須
將三五族半導體製程，與矽製程相結合，但其
相容性不高，且增加製程的困難度、與製作的
成本。目前多半運用異質接合的方法。由於矽
鍺具有載子移動速度較快的特點，因此，適合
進行高速處理，除此之外，低耗電率與低生產
成本，將比化合物半導體具優勢。矽鍺異質層
最主要的優點之一就是矽和鍺有不同的隙、傳
導帶、價電帶，因此可依據不同的成分比適度
控制能隙、導帶及價帶，並改善電子或電洞的
移動速率，而矽鍺由於製程和矽相近，又可應
用在高頻、高速、光電元件，能適當控制能隙，
且價格低廉，因此逐漸成為受矚目的半導體材
料，故本計劃第一年重點在於利用不同矽鍺合
金，使沉積Si 於SiGe 合金上，利用SiGe 合
金本身之晶格常數的不同，如改變SiGe 合金
之厚度、比例和沉積不同的Si 厚度會產生不
同應力大小，調變已存在於Si 和SiGe 之應力
大小的分別進行反應沈積法(RDE，reactive 
deposition epitaxy) 和離子束合成法(IBS，
ion implantation synthesis)和夾層法
(interposing effect)，成長高品質矽基β
-FeSi2 量子點，第二年則是利用第一年所 
得之參數最佳化製做成元件，而研發成果的優
勢是可以和現有成熟的矽半導體製程整合，直 
接在矽基板上製造出發光元件，如此則降低了
開發成本及生產成本，更進一步開發以SiGe 
為主的發光元件，結合SiGe 高速元件之特性
加上發光元件之整合。 
英文摘要 
TaSi2 nanowires have been synthesized on Si 
substrate by annealing NiSi2 films at 950  in ℃
an ambient containing Ta vapor. The nanowires 
could be grown up to 13 µm in length. 
Field-emission measurements show that the 
turn-on field is low at 4-4.5 V/µm and the 
threshold field is down to 6 V/µm with the field 
enhancement factor as high as 1800. The 
metallic TaSi2 nanowires exhibit excellent 
electrical properties with remarkable high failure 
current density of 3×108 Acm-2. In addition, 
effects of annealing temperatures and capability 
of metal silicide mediation layer on the growth 
of nanowires are addressed. This simple 
approach promises future applications in 
nano-electronics and nano-optoelectronics 
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
One-dimensional (1D) systems such as 
nanowires (NWs), nanorods, nanobelts and 
nanotubes have attracted much attention owing 
to their unique optical, electronic, and 
mechanical properties.1,2 On the other hand, the 
requirements for interconnect and contact in the 
next generation nanoelectronics are low 
resistivity, good ohmic contact to both p- and 
n-type semiconductor, high temperature stability, 
low cost and compatibility with the processing 
electron microscope (JEM-3000F, operated at 
300 kV with point-to-point resolution of 0.17 nm) 
equipped with an energy dispersion spectrometer 
(EDS) and a high angle annular dark-field 
(HAADF) detector was used to obtain the 
information of the microstructures and the 
chemical compositions. The surface morphology 
was examined with a field-emission scanning 
electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6500F) 
operating at 15 kV. The electron field-emission 
properties were measured in a vacuum at a 
pressure of 1×10-7 Torr using a spherical 
stainless-steel probe (1 mm in diameter) as the 
anode. The lowest emission current was 
recorded on the level of nA. The measurement 
distance between the anode and emitting surface 
was fixed at 100 µm. Electrical measurements 
were performed by sequential procedures 
including electrodes defined by electron-beam 
lithography, metal evaporation, and device 
evaluation. The 30 kV cold field-emission SEM 
(FEI-SIRION) with nano pattern generation 
system (NPGS) was utilized for these purposes. 
A LabView program was used to control the I-V 
testing process. 
Figure 1(a) shows the SEM image of 
nanowires synthesized by annealing the NiSi2 
film sample on Si substrate at 950 ℃ for 16 h in 
a Ta ambient. The diameters and lengths of the 
nanowires are about 20-30 nm and 3-6 µm, 
respectively, with the aspect-ratios of about 100 
to 300. The pie-chart of the distribution of 
diameters is shown in Figure 1(b). When the 
annealing time was extended to 32 h, the length 
of nanowires could grow to over 13 µm with an 
aspect-ratio of about 650 [Figures 1(c)]. The 
density of TaSi2 nanowires with the length of 3-6 
µm synthesized by NiSi2 nanodots samples was 
significantly increased compared to that of films, 
as shown in Fig.1(d). Pinholes with the 
closest-packed ｛111｝ facets seen elsewhere 
indicate that the Si atoms had been vaporized or 
migrated out of the Si substrate to react with Ta 
to form TaSi2 during the growth of the 
nanowires [Insets in Figs. 1(c) and (f)]. All the 
nanowires were grown uniformly on the Si 
substrate and the tip regions were semi-spherical 
in shape without the presence of metal catalysts. 
The GIXRD spectrum taken from NiSi2 
nanodots as the mediation layer, as shown in Fig. 
1(e), reveals that the nanowires are of TaSi2 
phase. The TaSi2 is hexagonal in structure [P222 
(180) point group] with a lattice constant of a = 
0.48 nm and c = 0.66 nm (JCPSD card, 
No-38-0483). In contrast, TaSi2 nanowires 
synthesized by annealing FeSi2 film in the same 
conditions, as shown in Fig. 1(f), had lengths of 
about 100-200 nm, considerably shorter than 
those with NiSi2 mediation layers.

synthesized by annealing the NiSi2 film samples

ambient. Upper insets show the corresponding 
side-view SEM images (90o tilting). (b) The 
pie-chart showing the distribution of diameters 
of TaSi2 nanowires grown by NiSi2 as a 
mediation layer. (c) Top-view SEM image of 
nanowires synthesized by annealing the NiSi2 
film on Si substrate at 950 ℃ for 32 h in a Ta 
ambient. The length of TaSi2 nanowires is as 
long as 13 µm. The long nanowires are marked 
between standard NiO sample and Ni atoms in 
TaSi2 nanowires was observed in the EELS 
spectrums. It suggests that the Ni atom in TaSi2 
nanowries is of natural type (Ni0) as the intensity 
ratio of L3/L2 edges is smaller than that of NiO 
standard sample.12 The Ni content in TaSi2 
nanowires was found to increase with annealing 
time and eventually reach a saturation value. The 
presence of the point defects in TaSi2 nanowires 
may result from the Ni atoms that reside in 
interstitial sites (octahedral and tetrahedral 
coordination) of the TaSi2 lattice.

as a function of applied electric field at a 
distance of 100 µm between emitting surface and 
anode for NiSi2 and FeSi2 film and nanodot on Si 
samples annealed at 950 ℃ for 16 h in a Ta 
ambient, respectively. The data were recorded 
for a series of experiments, denoted as 1st, 3rd, 
and 5th. Insets in (a) and (b) show the 
corresponding ln(J/E2)-1/E plots, (c) The 
relationships between aspect-ratio and field 
enhancement factor for TaSi2 nanowires

samples at 950 ℃ for 16 h. (d) The stability test 
with fixed voltage at 700 V over time for TaSi2 
nanowires synthesized with NiSi2 nanodot 
sample after annealing at 950 ℃ for 16 h. Inset 
shows a similar plot with a fixed voltage at 900 
V. 
Figures 3(a) and (b) show the current density 
as a function of the applied voltage for TaSi2 
nanowire synthesized by FeSi2 and NiSi2 film 
and nanodot samples at 950 ℃ for 16 h in a Ta 
ambient, respectively. The measured distance 
between anode and emitting surface was fixed at 
100 µm. The turn-on field and threshold field for 
field-emission measurements are defined as the 
applied voltage to produce a current density of 
0.01 mA/cm2 and 10 mA/cm2, respectively. The 
shorter TaSi2 nanowires synthesized with the 
FeSi2 mediation film exhibit a turn-on field of 
6.3-7.3 V/µm. On the other hand, the turn-on 
field is decreased to about 5.3 V/µm for longer 
TaSi2 nanowires synthesized with FeSi2 
mediation dots [Fig. 3(a)]. The reduction in 
turn-on field is associated with the increase in 
aspect-ratio. The TaSi2 nanowires synthesized by 
annealing NiSi2 film and nanodot samples 
exhibit excellent field-emission properties. The 
turn-on fields are down to 4.6-5.2 V/µm and 
4-4.5 V/µm for film and nanodot samples, 
respectively. In addition, the threshold field can 
be found to be about 6.5 V/µm for the TaSi2 
nanowires mediated by NiSi2 film while the 
threshold field can be down to about 6 V/µm for 
nanodot samples [Fig. 3(b)]. Although these 
values of turn-on fields are higher than the best 
reported values of carbon nanotube,13, 14 they are 
still much lower than many other types of 
emitters such as Si nanowires,15 In2O3,16 
MoO3,17, 18 TiSi2,7 W18O49 nanowires,19 CuO20 
nanowires and ZnO,21 and SnO2 nanowires22. 
The insets in Figs. 3(a) and (b) show the plots of 
the ln(J/E2) - (1/E) relationship. The linear

TaSi2 nanowires synthesized by annealing NiSi2 
film sample at 950 ℃ for 32 h, respectively. The 
resistance of nanowire was estimated to be about 
2.47 and 2.29 kΩ, respectively. (c) The 
resistivity as a function of temperature. Inset 
shows the SEM image of the I-V measurement 
configuration. (d) I-V curve recorded at high 
applied voltages  
For I-V measurement, Cr was selected as the 
contact metal with a work function of 4.4 eV, 
which is smaller than that of TaSi2 (4.7 eV). It 
provides a better Ohmic contact compared to the 
other metals, such as Au (~5.1 eV) or Pt (~5.7 
eV).  In this letter, the four-probe 
measurements were performed but failed owing 
to the high contact resistance between electrode 
1 and the nanowire, as shown in the inset of Fig. 
3(c). Instead, the resistance of TaSi2 nanowire 
with 25 nm in diameter synthesized by annealing 
NiSi2 film at 950 ℃ for 32 h was calculated to 
be 2.47 kΩ at 300 K via three-probe 
measurements (2-2-3-4) minus the contact 
resistance of electrode 2, as shown in Fig. 4(a) 
[Figure 2S].30 The linear I-V behavior at 300 K 
shows that electrical characteristic of TaSi2 
nanowire is metallic with a low resistivity of 
about 114 µΩ-cm, which is higher than that of its 
bulk counterpart.31 The higher measured 
resistivity is attributed to several reasons: the 
presence of doping Ni atoms in the nanowires; 
oxide coating layer; contaminations around the 
surface and contact regions, which are 
unavoidably generated during the device 
processing. In addition, defects and anisotropy in 
electron transport (along ]0112[ growth direction) 
in TaSi2 nanowires may influence the measured 
resistivity. The elastic scattering mean free path 
of electrons in the TaSi2 nanowire can be 
estimated to be about 8 nm at 300 K,32 indicating 
that the TaSi2 nanowire retains the attractive 
metallic transport property. As the measured 
temperature was reduced to 70 K, the I-V 
characteristic still kept the linear behavior [Fig. 
4(b)]. Figure 4(c) shows the resistivity as a 
function of temperature. The resistivity was 
decreased with the temperature and saturated at a 
temperature below 30 K. The residual resistivity 
was found to be about 107 µΩ-cm, which is also 
higher than that of bulk.32 Again, the oxide 
coating layer may be the detrimental factor. The 
finding suggests that TaSi2 nanowires have great 
potential to be used as contact and interconnect 
for future nano-electronics. In addition, the 
negative curvature (d2ρ/dT2 < 0) found in Fig. 
4(c) is similar to bulk behavior. It suggests that 
the electron-phonon scattering is dominant for 
the transport mechanism [part C in 
supplementary file].33 The results of durability 
and reliability test of the TaSi2 nanowire were 
obtained by performing I-V measurements under 
very high applied current and voltage, as shown 
in Fig. 4(d). The nanowire can endure a current 
of up to 2.2 mA under high voltage stress before 
failure. Note that a high current density of 3×108 
Acm-2 is estimated in this case, which is 
comparable with the other metallic nanowires, 
such as NiSi nanowires (3×108 Acm-2),9 CNT 
of TaSi2 nanowires synthesized by annealing 
CoSi2 film sample at 950 ℃ for 16 h. Inset 
shows the corresponding 90° tilted SEM image. 
Top-view SEM images for (j) TiSi2, (k) TaSi2 
and (l) PtSi film samples after annealing at 950 
℃ for 16 h. All annealing samples  were 
conducted in a Ta ambient. 
By decreasing the thickness of NiSi2 from 30 
nm to 1.5 nm, the average density and length of 
TaSi2 are increased compared to that of film 
samples. For further probing the effects of 
mediation layer, 30-nm-thick Co, Ti, Ta, and Pt 
metals were also prepared by e-beam deposition. 
After pre-annealing at 850 ℃ for 2 h, CoSi2, 
TiSi2, TaSi2 and PtSi layers were formed. Fig. 
5(i) shows SEM image of the TaSi2 nanowires 
mediated by CoSi2 (m.p. = 1326 ℃) film sample 
after annealing at 950 ℃ for 16 h. The lengths 
and diameters of TaSi2 nanowires were 
measured to be about 100-200 nm and 20-40 nm, 
respectively, which is almost identical to that of 
FeSi2 film sample. By using the metal silicide 
layer with higher melting point, such as TiSi2 
(m.p. = 1540 ℃), the length and density of TaSi2 
nanowires are significantly decreased at the 
identical annealing condition (950 ℃ for 16 h). 
It is attributed to the degree of supersaturation 
with Si atoms from substrate and metal silicide 
mediation layer is decreased, resulting in the 
decrease in segregation for Si atoms from metal 
silicide mediation layer. Accordingly, it was 
expected and confirmed that no nanowires would 
grow if very high melting point metal silicide, 
such as the TaSi2 (m.p. = 2200 ℃) mediation 
layer, was used after annealing at 950 ℃ for 16 
h. An example is shown in Fig. 5(k). On the 
other hand, no nanowires were grown in samples 
with PtSi mediation layer after annealing at 950 
℃ for 16 h, although the melting point of PtSi 
(1229℃) is close to that of FeSi2, as shown in 
Fig. 4(l). The dominant diffusing species for the 
metal disilicides such as FeSi2, NiSi2, CoSi2, 
TiSi2, and TaSi2, used in the present study are Si 
atoms while for the PtSi, the diffusing specie is 
dominated by Pt atoms. Thus, Si atoms diffused 
rapidly from the substrate, saturated and 
eventually segregated from the metal disilicide 
mediation layers during the high temperature 
annealing.25 In contrast, the segregation of Si 
atoms would not occur if the dominant diffusing 
species are metal atoms. In addition, the metal 
species were found to decompose from metal 
silicide mediation layers such as FeSi2, NiSi2, 
CoSi2, and TiSi2 films to distribute in the TaSi2 
nanowires during the growth. Consequently, the 
TaSi2 nanowires grow in length with the increase 
in metal concentration during the annealing 
process. 
 
四、 結論與討論 
In summary, TaSi2 nanowires have been 
synthesized successfully by annealing different 
silicide mediation layers at 950 ℃ in a Ta 
ambient. The length of TaSi2 can be enhanced by 
annealing the NiSi2 layer. Field-emission 
measurements show the excellent performance 
with the lowest turn-on field of 4-4.5 V/µm and 
the threshold field is down to 6 V/µm. In 
addition, the field enhancement factor is as high 
as 1800 for NiSi2 nanodot samples. 
Measurements of electrical transport properties 
indicate that the metallic TaSi2 nanowires can 
endure a current of up to 2.2 mA with the 
calculated current density of 3×108 Acm-2. The 
metal content in TaSi2 nanowires was found to 
increase with annealing time and eventually
