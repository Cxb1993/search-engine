Abstract  
The main topic of the research is concerned with 
adaptive predictive controller design for the problem of 
input delay based on the Lyapunov approach. The main 
problem of designing predictive controller is how to 
determine the values of control gains and compensate the 
effect of input delay for the predictable state. In this 
study, we will first propose a novel predictive controller 
called adaptive predictive controller and use it to take 
place of the roles of the traditional adaptive controller 
used in nonlinear control system without input delay. 
This can greatly reduce the computational time and 
controller complexities due to the simple configuration 
of the adaptive predictive controller. It is also easy for 
hardware implementation. Next, simplex algorithm can 
search the optimal timing for a prediction to compensate 
the effect of input delay by minimizing the performance 
index of integrated absolute error. In this research, we 
use the techniques of neural network predictive model 
and direct adaptive scheme to design the adaptive 
predictive controller for some class of nonlinear systems 
with input delay. To enhance input-delay systems 
stability between the size of input delay, system 
parameters and adaptation law, a supervised control 
scheme and adaptive predictive controller of unknown 
nonlinear systems with input delay are proposed. The 
supervised adaptive control law aims to pull the states 
back to the pre-specified state region and reduce 
overshoot towards an extra stabilizing input. Finally, 
some computer simulation results will also be provided 
to illustrate our proposed methods.

I. INTRODUCTION 
During the recent years, a number of research 
activities have been concerned with the topic of tracker 
design of nonlinear systems with input delay [1]-[4] due 
to the slow energy transmission in plants of systems, 
input delay naturally existing in practical systems. 
Time-delay existence is frequently a cause of instability 
due to encountering in various closed-loop engineering 
systems [5]-[9]. 
Recently, the model-based adaptive controllers have 
been widely used in many practical control problems 
owing to their powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities 
and adaptabilities. However, typical indirect adaptive 
control [10][11] with structural complexities. Inspire by 
direct adaptive control [12]-[14], we extend a predictive 
controller and supervisory to the practical system with 
input delay and modeling error. All of them, however, 
neglects the generalized modeling error between 
nonlinear system with input delay and model. Existence 
of the generalized modeling error and input delay may be 
a potential source of instability for control designs that 
have been based on the assumption which the model 
exactly matches the plant [15]. Hence, a robustness 
design of adaptive predictive controller for nonlinear 
systems with input delay needs further study.  
In this paper, a neural network model [16] is used to 
design a predictive controller. Over the past few years, 
neural network based modeling had become an active 
research field because of its unique merits in solving 
complex nonlinear system identification and control 
problems [17]. Hence, we use the technique of predictive 
model based on the neural network modeling method and 
direct adaptive scheme based on the Lyapunov approach 
to design the adaptive predictive controller for some 
class of nonlinear systems with input delay. Unlike 
conventional modeling, neural network modeling is 
essentially a multi-model approach in which individual 
neurons are combined to describe the global behavior of 
the system.  
Recently, the model-based predictive control (MPC) 
design [18]-[19] has been widely used in nonlinear 
systems without input delay. However, in practical 
control systems the plants are always nonlinear and

The derivation of the adaptive control law begins 
with assuming the existence of an optimal parameter 
vector, *θ , for the ideal control law:

such that the absolute of the approximation error,

Let us begin with considering a Lyapunov function

C. Predictive Model Design 
(See Fig.2) The series-parallel identification model (SPM) 
is used here for the prediction )(ˆ tx  of the system output 
)(tx  [16]. In this SPM, the output of the plant is 
feedback into the identification model as shown in Fig.2a. 
Based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and steepest 
descent method (SDM), [16] proposes a hybrid algorithm 
for the learning of neural networks to identify complex 
nonlinear systems by adjusting weights and bias between 
neurons. In this paper, neural networks trained by 
combining GA and SDM are used in the prediction of 
nonlinear systems with input delays that achieve a 
superior performance in the identification of this kind of 
systems. 
An SDM is used to train the weight and bias of a 
neural network over an extended period of time. 
Although this traditional method obtains a rapid 
convergence in learning, its weakness lies in the fact that 
a local optimum is always found. Recently, GAs have 
been used to replace SDMs in the training of NNs. That 
is, because a GA always reaches the global optimum 
instead of a local optimum. However, a problem then 
arises in that the process of reproduction takes much 
longer, and the convergent rate consequently becomes 
much slower than that of a SDM. It would appear 
self-evident, then, that the learning performances of 
SDM and GA may in fact be complementary. Therein 
lies the motivation for integrating SDM and GA to be a 
hybrid algorithm for the training of a neural network. 
In the neural network (Fig.2b), a hyperbolic tangent 
function is chosen as the activation function of a hidden 
layer, and a linear function is chosen as the activation 
function of an output layer. For the convenience, a series 
of training results for the neural network predictive 
models with input delay, 5.0 ..., ,02.0 ,01.0=dτ , are 
obtained by the hybrid algorithm [16] in advance, 
respectively. 
 
D. Estimation of Input-Delay 
Taking tracking performance together with 
estimation of input delay dτ  into consideration, the 
overall performance index, J , is defined as follows. 
∫ ⋅= ft dtteJ 0 )( ,                 (26) 
where ft  is termination time of simulation.
