Abstract: This project proposes n efficient 
approach that consists of an experimental 
design and fuzzy logic model (FLM) to 
generate macromodels for the simulation of 
MEMS. In the present approach, a force 
macromodel is firstly adapted to perform the 
coupled simulations. Then, an experimental 
design is utilized to reduce the number of data 
needed for macromodel identification, and an 
FLM is chosen to fit the data. The FLM 
identification scheme efficiently obtains the 
FLM structure parameters that lead to an 
accurate macromodel. The approach has 
applied to MEMS. The efficiency and 
effectiveness of the current approach has been 
demonstrated with the simulation results. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Computational coupled analysis has 
attracted much attention in the design of 
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), 
which require self-consistent solutions to 
coupled energy domains via nonlinear partial 
differential equations [1]. Numerical 
approaches, such as the finite-element method 
(FEM), can yield coupled quasi-static 
solutions [2]. However, the coupled 
simulations of fully meshed FEM models are 
usually time-consuming due to the fact that 
the models are usually with significant 
degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the coupled 
dynamic analysis of the system-level design 
requires many simulations, which are quite 
inefficient. Approaches using macromodels 
with relatively fewer degrees of freedom (also 
called as reduced-order models) have been 
proposed to improve the efficiency of coupled 
dynamic analysis [3-7]. These macromodel 
approaches can accurately model the system 
by capturing the dominant dynamic behaviors 
and are effective for fast coupled system-level 
design. 
The macromodel can be obtained via the 
fitting of a set of sampling data. This approach 
may demand many basis functions, leading to 
high input dimensions and also raising the 
complexity of data generation in running a 
large number of simulations [3]. And these 
previously proposed methods, such as 
multivariate polynomials [3] and neural 
network [4], have some drawbacks. The 
multivariate-polynomial model is with low 
efficiency, and the neural network approach 
cannot provide a meaningful interpretation of 
the network structure, which poses difficulty 
in determining the structure. The 
macromodels in [3,4] are even with the 
differentiation of the identified energy model. 
Based on the discussions, it is imperative to 
achieve the efficient macromodel. 
Eq. (5), we have

where )()( qfqp m
T
ii ϕ=  is the generalized 
force, referred to as the force macromodel. 
On the other hand, the reduced-order 
dynamic equations can also be directly 
derived from Eq. (1) using the magnetic 
co-energy [3]:

where )(* qum  is the magnetic co-energy 
resulting from unit input current, referred to as 
the energy macromodel, and its differentiation 
im qqu ∂∂ )(*  represents the generalized force.  
Eqs. (7) and (8) are both reduced-order 
equations for different forms of magnetic 
macromodels, leading to different 
computation procedures. Here, the force 
macromodel )(qpi  first requires the 
evaluation of the magnetic force in 
displacement (u) space, and is then obtained 
by projecting the magnetic force onto the 
generalized q space with the inner product of 
the magnetic force and the normal modes. The 
energy macromodel )(* qum , on the other hand, 
requires the co-energy function to be 
established in q’s space, and the generalized 
force is then obtained with the differentiation 
of the co-energy function.  
To increase the efficiency in performing 
the coupled dynamic system simulations in 
Equations (7) and (8), macromodels in 
analytical form are required. In order to 
generate macromodels, it is necessary to select 
the basis functions that are significantly 
contributed to the system dynamic behavior. 
The selection process begins with the typical 
displacement, su , that contains information 
on the amplitude for each basis function [3,4]. 
The displacement is calculated from the 
coupled quasi-static analysis with FEM 
software, such as ANSYS. Using the ns (about 
30) modes of the lower natural frequency as 
the basis functions, the displacement can be 
expanded with the coefficients yi as 
 
∑
=
≈ s
n
i
iis yu

ϕ                         (9) 
 
Note that Eq. (9) is an overdetermined 
system requiring a least-square solution. The 
QR factorization algorithm is adopted to yield 
the coefficients yi [15]. The displacements of 
the modes can then be calculated by indicating 
important modes. Furthermore, the 
magnitudes of the coefficients yi are used to 
predict the relative ranges of qi for the input 
domain of the macromodel. Once the basis 
functions and the estimation range are 
determined, the fuzzy model identification 
method can be used to generate the nonlinear 
macromodel. 
The fuzzy macromodel generation with 
the identification technique includes data 
sampling, FLM selection, and FLM 
identification, described below. 
 
A.  Data Sampling 
The data for macromodel generation are 
the generalized coordinates q  as the input 
variables and the generalized force or 
co-energy as the output. The experimental 
design takes certain values, called levels, for 
every input variable. The levels are used to 
adequately span the input range. The number 
of input data depends on the input variables 
and levels. Data with more input variables (i.e., 
more basis functions) and levels lead to more 
accurate macromodels, but also increase the 
goal of FLM identification is to maximize R2 
to 1, and thus the resulting FLM makes 
accurate prediction of the input domain. There 
are two major tasks in identifying an FLM for 
a system: structure and parameter 
identification [17-19], each of which consists 
of a premise and consequence part. 
The cluster estimation method [9,10] is 
used here for the coarse tuning process of the 
FLM identification algorithm. Data point 
potential measure is used to locate the cluster 
centers, defined as

4exp          (15) 
where .  denotes the Euclidean distance and 
ar  a positive constant used to define the 
effective radius of a neighborhood. The data 
points with higher potentials are chosen as 
cluster centers. Each cluster center is in 
essence a prototypical data point that 
exemplifies a characteristic behavior of the 
system [9]. Hence, each cluster center can be 
used as the basis of a rule describing system 
behavior, and the number of fuzzy rules will 
be equal to that of the cluster centers.  
When the fuzzy structure is determined, 
parametric identification of a fuzzy model 
based on the gradient-descent and 
backpropagation method is then conducted. 
The output of the FLM is calculated and 
internal parameters are updated by the 
instantaneous error between the fuzzy logic 
model output kyˆ  and the current training 
data output ky . Here, we minimize the square 
of the instantaneous error with respect to the 
unknown parameters 0ip , ijp , ijc , and ijσ  
of the internal functions and membership 
functions, i.e.,

By applying the chain rule on Eq. (16), we can 
obtain the equations for updating the estimates 
of the unknown parameters 0ip , ijp , ijc , and 
ijσ  as

The gradient-descent method is used to 
minimize the instantaneous error. Since this 
method is basically a kind of hill-climbing 
technique, it runs the risk of being trapped in a 
local minimum, where every small change in 
synaptic parameters 0ip , ijp , ijc , and ijσ  
would increase the square-error function kE . 
Therefore, initial parameter estimation is 
crucial when this method is used. Here, the 
initial parameter estimations, ijc  and 0ip , are 
the coordinates of the ith cluster center

defined as the distance with the constant, ar , 
i.e., aij rl ×=σ . By using the results obtained in 
[10], parameter l is set to )24/(3 , and ijp  
to zero. The method is used repeatedly to 
update the model parameters until 2min2 RR ≥ . 
Note that the criterion 2min
2 RR ≥  is to ensure 
the accuracy of the FLM. 
Finally, intermediate FLMs with various 
electrostatic microactuator [2,3,23] as shown 
in Fig. 6. With the proposed procedure, the 
first 3 modes, shown in Fig. 7, were firstly 
taken as the shape functions and the Taguchi’s 
method is used. Then, the fuzzy macromodel 
is identified and the final simulation result is 
obtained as shown in Fig. 8.
