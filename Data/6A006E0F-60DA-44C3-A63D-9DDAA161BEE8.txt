Abstract 
Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) 
controllers, such as Static Var Compensator (SVC) and 
Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), may 
interact adversely with one another. When the controller 
parameters of a dynamic device are tuned try to obtain 
the best performance, control conflicts arise between 
various FACTS controllers may lead to the onset of 
oscillations. 
This paper proposes a flexible AC transmission 
system (FACTS) devices design using fuzzy lead-lag 
controller with Advanced Continuous Ant Colony 
Optimization (ACACO). The multi-machines power 
system in this paper are designed and both the thyristor 
controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and static var 
compensator (SVC) equip with a fuzzy lead-lag 
controller is employed to improve the power system 
stability. The fuzzy controller (FC) adjusts the parameter 
of lead-leg controller at each control step and the all of 
the parameters in FC are not designed in advance. The 
proposed learning approach avoids the time-consuming 
task of the design parameter of power oscillation 
damping (POD). All of the free parameters in a FC are 
optimized using ACACO, in which the pheromone 
evaporate rate and new generated solution operations 
increase as the generations evolve to advance the 
convergence ability. The proposed ACACO is compared 
with other various optimization algorithms to 
demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness in the power 
system stability problem.

I. Introduction 
Power system stability control is an 
important problem for ensuring system stable 
operation [1]. The stability is easy affected from 
the external distribution or the internal 
mechanical torque. Stability problems of power 
system associate with undamped oscillations and 
voltage collapse so that cause the city blackouts. 
Power electronics development has involved the 
real application of structural control of electric 
power networks recently. In this context, the 
FACTS devices are becoming more significance. 
Due to their fast response, these devices are used 
for dynamically adjusting the network 
configuration to enhance steady-state 
performance as well as dynamic stability. [2-4]. 
The availability of FACTS devices like 
static var compensator (SVC), thyristor controlled 
series compensator (TCSC), static synchronous 
series compensator (SSSC), unified power flow 
controller (UPFC), and static synchronous 
compensator (STATCOM) can provide variable 
turn and/or series compensation [4]. But they also 
can interact adversely with one another. When the 
controller parameters of a dynamic device are 
tuned try to obtain the best performance, control 
conflicts arise between various FACTS 
controllers may lead to the onset of oscillations. 
The TCSC and SVC have been widely studied 
and reported in the technical literature and have 
been shown to significantly enhance system 
 3 
linearized to get a set of linear state equations, in 
which we can examine the small-signal stability 
of the system with eigenvalue analysis. The 
electromechanical modes are close to the 
imaginary axis of the complex plane. The 
damping for the three dominant modes needs to 
be increased and the requirement for appropriate 
stabilization equipment to damp out the 
multimachine power system oscillations is 
evident. The TCSC is inserted into the 
transmission line to control the power flow. The 
SVC is placed at the generator bus to provide 
instantaneous reactive power modulation for 
voltage maintenance.

In order to create better continuous operating 
characteristics and application, a complete TCSC 
compensation system is made up of several single 
module TCSCs in series to fill in the gaps 
between operation modes, as shown in Fig. 3. 
The block diagram for the TCSC model for 
typical transient and oscillatory stability studies is 
shown in Fig. 4 [13]. There are three inputs for 
various purposes: an auxiliary signal Xauxilary 
which could be the input from an external power 
flow controller, the reference Xreference, which 
is the initial operating point of the TCSC; and the 
small-signal modulation input Xmodulation to 
provide stability.  
The SVC is comprised of thristor controlled 
reactor (TCR) and fixed capacitors (FC). The 
Configuration of FC-TCR SVC is shown in Fig. 
5. The nonlinear equivalent block diagram of the 
TCR part of SVC is shown in Fig. 6. The 
equivalent admittance of the TCR can be 
obtained from 
       ( 1 ) 
Where BL MAX is the total admittance of the 
reactors and relative to its MVA rating. The 
currents of the TCR and FC can be represented in 
two-axis components. The auxiliary controllers 
can give an additional control signal to the 
voltage regulator terminal.

III. CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION 
A. Lead-Leg Controller 
A traditional lead-lag controller is employed 
to provide control signal for FACTS devices, 
such Xmodulation of thyristor controlled series 
capacitor (TCSC) in Fig. 4 and VAUX of static var 
compensator (SVC) in Fig. 6 based on 
supplementary control signals, such as bus 
voltage, linear active power, and generator rotor 
speed, are often employed to enhance the 
damping contributed by TCSC and SVC to 
power oscillations, thereby obtaining much 
higher levels of stable power transfer.

ACO in [20,21] is proposed to apply in real space, 
is called ACOR. In ACOR, the domain of variable 
js  is continuous and its sampling is based on a 
continuous probability density function (PDF) 
( )j jP s . New generated solutions are sampling by 
the PDF. The PDF uses the Gaussian kernel PDF 
[20-22] ( )j jP s  is computed as a weighted iw  
sum of N  one-dimensional Gaussian density

where the ijv  and ijd  denote the mean and 
standard variation, respectively, and iw  is a 
weighting coefficient recomputed at each learning 
iteration according to the performance of the 
sampled value. If the variables 1, , Ds s  are 
optimized, then D  different density function 
1, , DP P  are defined. The weighting coefficient 
iw  is assigned according the performance of 
solution is , where a better solution is associated 
with a high weight. The weight iw  is computed

where the q  is a weighting factor. When q  is

where the parameter   is a constant value, has 
an effect similar to that of the pheromone 
evaporation rate in ACO [17-19]. The higher the 
value of  , the lower the convergence speed of 
the algorithm. The standard variation ijd  tends 
to improve learning converges because the 
variation between the different solutions 
1 , ,j Njs s  with the generation number. Based in 
equa. (7), the better performance of solutions is 
assigned a high jP  so that it is selected 
according high probability. New solutions are 
generated by selection and sampling in equa. (7) 
and the original solutions are replaced because 
the performance is worst than new ones.  
On the basic of this concept, this paper 
proposes the ACACO for fuzzy lead-lag 
controller optimum. The following subsection 
introduces the ACACO algorithms in detail. 
B. Advanced Continuous Ant Colony 
Optimization (ACACO) 
Initially, the ACACO works N  ants 
(solutions) 1, , Ns s  in each generation and are 
randomly generated as in PSO and GA. An ant 
corresponds to a fuzzy system so that an ant only 
optimizes its according fuzzy system. Fig. 8 
shows the ACACO geometric construction, 
where the D  variables in solution vector is  
represents according solution 1, ,i iDs s . Each 
solution vector represents all of the parameters in 
a FS, i.e. a solution vector represents a signal FS. 
The N  solutions 1, , Ns s  are sorted by their 
according performance and solution ls  has rank 
l  that is from best to worst.

Fig. 8. CACO geometric construction 
In Fig. 8, the path connects to nodes in the 
i th row, and the paths are deposited the 
pheromone level i . The performance of better 
solution is assigned high pheromone level so that 
their paths are selected by high probability, i.e., 
the pheromone level 1 2 N     . Besides, 
the pheromone level i  is similarly to the 
weighting coefficient ijw  in ACOR. This paper 
proposes ACACO algorithm is unnecessary 
assigned pheromone level in advance. The ant 
moves from initial state through variables 
1, , 1D  and stops at variable D . The paths 
are selected by the pheromone level. For example, 
Fig. 8 marks an ant path by bold line and each 
node variable are visited by ant selected. The 
completion of the i th ant path constructs to the

evaluated by the cost function C. This paper 
employs the cost value C to evaluate the 
performance of each fuzzy lead-lag controller and 
it is computed using the root-maen-sqrare error 
(RMSE) of generator-speed deviation   and 
generator-angle deviation  .

For improve stable respond of each generator

the cost value at the last 3000 time step, and is set 
to be 100 , otherwise is set to be 1. The solution 
vector in equa. (13) functions as an ant (FC). The 
ACACO optimizes all of the free parameters in a 
fuzzy lead-lag controller with the number rules 
being fixed. 
V. EXAMPLES 
From system data and eigenanalysis, the 
TCSC is inserted into the transmission line 
connected between bus 2 and 4, SVC is equipped 
for bus 3 to obtain better damping effect. It has 
been examined, but is not reveal here, that place 
the TCSC and SVC at other different 
transmission line and bus will obtain similar 
comparative result under the same design 
procedure. In the designed fuzzy lead-lag 
controller, all of the parameters are optimized 
through ACACO. In applying ACACO, initially, 
20 ants are randomly generated, i.e., 20N  . 
The parameters fix =0.3, wKu =1000. wTu =1, 
1T
u =10, and 
2T
u =1. To collect the training data, 
the following condition is simulated. For the 
statics, this paper sets the number of evaluation to 
be 
41000 10 10   and is repeated for 30 runs.  
Example 1(Controller design in training 
phase). In training phase, this paper assumes that 
at 0.2s, a sudden increment of 0.1 p.u. mechanical 
torque at the 2th, 3th, and 4th generator, this 
increment disappears after 0.3s. The data are 
collected for the time interval 0-9s, with a 
sampling interval of 0.001s. In this oscillatory 
control problem, this paper designs two lead-lag 
controllers for according FACTS devices and 
there are eight parameters in total are optimized 
through ACACO algorithm. The average of cost 
value and standard deviation (STD) are 0.046504 
and 0.000244, respectively. This paper proposes a 
new design approach where two lead-lag 
controllers through fuzzy control, and is called 
fuzzy lead-lag controller. The FACTS devices are 
designed using fuzzy lead-lag controller where 
the all of the free parameters are optimized 
through ACACO, and is called F-ACACO. 
The cost value of F-ACACO is shown in 
Table I. To show the efficiency of F-ACACO that

improved continuous ACO, such as ACO , 
with the two selection coefficients 0.01q   and 
10q   in [20] (F-ACOR), elite-guide of CACO 
in [22] (F-RCACO), set 0.85   and 5L   of 
ACACO (F-CACO), and the performance is 
shown in Table I. For these improved continuous 
ACO approach, the average best-so-far cost value 
of each generation are shown in Fig. 9.

In a previous study [23-25], improved PSO 
were applied as well as the fuzzy control problem. 
These algorithms include an improved PSO 
(IPSO)[23], a hierarchical PSO with time-varying 
acceleration coefficient (HPSO-TVAC) [24], and 
hybrid of GA and PSO (HGAPSO) [25]. Table II 
shows the performance of F-ACACO with 
comparison with fuzzy lead-lag controller 
designed through modified EAs and the average 
cost value is shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that 
the F-ACACO achieves a smaller cost value than 
the algorithms used for comparison. 
For statistical analysis, this paper uses the 
t-test to evaluate whether the difference between 
ACACO and the other algorithms is significant.

perturbation appears at unpredictable time and 
magnitude. Unlike the given specific incremental 
mechanical torque, this example simulates 
unpredictable perturbation. First, this paper 
supposes that mechanical torque incurs 
unpredictable perturbation with unknown time 
and magnitude at corresponding 2th, 3th, and 4th 
generator. The perturbations are randomly and 
uniform occurred at time within [0, 5] second and 
magnitude within [0, 0.1] p.u., and all of 
increments only effect 0.1s. The first increment of 
0.085 p.u. mechanical torque occurs at 2th 
generator at 2.23s, and other generators are also 
affected. At 3.33s and 3.72s, there are sudden 
increments of 0.045p.u. and 0.01p.u. at 
corresponding 4th and 3th generator. In Fig. 13 
and Table V, the fuzzy lead-lag controller 
successfully applied unknown perturbation, and 
the robustness is better than other power 
oscillation damping controllers.

VI. Conclusions 
This paper proposes a new controller of 
FACTS device design approach using fuzzy 
lead-lag controller. In this approach, the fuzzy 
control with ACACO not only adjusts the 
parameters of lead-lag controller at each control 
step to improve power oscillation stability but 
also avoid time-consuming task. The proposed 
ACACO algorithm improves the convergence 
ability and is compared with other various 
optimization algorithms to show the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the ACACO in power system 
stability problem. Examples in suddenly increase 
perturbation environments and comparisons with 
FACTS devices equip with lead-lag controller 
through ACACO illustrate the advantage of using 
the fuzzy lead-lag controller in the power stability 
control problems.
