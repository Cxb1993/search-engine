This proposal has been aimed at exploring 
the effects of the MBE growth conditions, 
including growth temperature, growth rate and 
V/III ratio, on the pinch-off leakage 
characteristics of mHEMTs. Various 
measurement technologies, including PL, AFM, 
x-ray RSM, Hall measurement, and I-V 
characteristics of the metamorphic buffer layer, 
have been used to characterize the epitaxial 
materials. Finally the mHEMT epi wafer has 
been grown and fabricated into devices. Results 
show gm of 340 mS/mm and excellent pinch-off 
characteristics which gives a ION/IOFF ratio as 
high as 106.

二、前言： 
InAlAs/InGaAs metamorphic high electron 
mobility transistors (mHEMTs) on GaAs sub-
strates have attracted much attention recently 
[1-3] because this technology combines the ex-
cellent high-frequency and low-noise perform-
ances inherent in InP-based HEMTs with the 
lower cost, larger wafer size, less fragility, and 
more mature processing of GaAs substrates. 
Besides, the indium composition of the InGaAs 
channel material can be freely chosen to meet 
the specific requirements of high-speed opera-
tion or high breakdown characteristics [4-6].  
The pinch-off leakage denotes the minimum 
current conducted in a HEMT device which is 
operated at the subthreshold regime. It is one of 
the most important HEMT device parameters, 
since it represents how perfectly the HEMT de-
vice stays at the OFF state. High pinch-off 
leakage can cause harmonic distortion and noise 
in a high-speed low-power RF circuit. The 
pinch-off leakage can be affected by several 
factors, including the transistor structure, device 
processing, and epitaxial quality. On the 
epi-growth side, the metamorphic buffer layer 
(MBL), which is needed to accommodate the 
dislocations caused by the lattice mismatch 
between GaAs and InAlAs, plays a crucial role 
in obtaining high quality mHEMT epitaxy.  
 
三、研究目的： 
In this project, we plan to examine the in-
fluence of the MBL growth conditions (tem-
perature, growth rate, and V/III ratio) on the 
epilayer quality using optical microscopy (OM), 
photoluminescence (PL), atomic force micros-
copy (AFM), Hall mobility, x-ray reciprocal 
space mapping (RSM), and I-V leakage test of a 
buffer structure. Adopting the optimal growth 
conditions, we fabricate InAlAs/InGaAs 
mHEMT devices with excellent pinch-off char-
acteristics. 
 
四、研究方法： 
For the implementation of this project, some 
epi structures have been designed and grown by 
solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on 
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrates. 
the triangular well has higher intensity than that 
from the bulk In0.52Al0.48As buffer layer, pre-
sumably due to the quantum confinement effect. 
The PL  has the maximum intensity at the 
growth temperature of 400 oC. For higher tem-
peratures, the PL intensity weakens although 
the OM surface morphology shows no observ-
able difference.   
AFM data indicate the smallest 
root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 
about 3.3 nm for the MBL growth temperature 
at 400 oC, as shown in Fig. 3 (solid square). The 
amorphous-like surface for MBL growth tem-
perature at 380 oC has the highest RMS rough-
ness of 5.3 nm. Fig. 3 (solid triangle) also 
shows the buffer leakage current estimated on 
the MBL test structure. The leakage current is 
defined at the applied voltage of 10 volt (across 
the contact electrodes separated by 150 μm). 
It’s found that the buffer leakage varies greatly. 
The MBL growth temperature of 400 oC gives 
the lowest buffer leakage current, while 380 oC 
causes the leakage dramatically high.

and buffer leakage on the MBL growth tem-
perature. 
 
For the mHEMT structure, the dependence 
of mobility on the MBL growth temperature is 
shown in Fig. 4. We can see that the mHEMT 
structures grown with the MBL growth tem-
perature above (including) 400 oC exhibit simi-
lar mobility of around 8700 ~ 9000 cm2/V-s. 
The Hall carrier concentrations for these sam-
ples are about 3×1012 cm-2. The amorphous-like 
sample shows a very poor mobility. The results 
of buffer leakage and Hall mobility indicate the 
best MBL growth temperature of 400 oC in this 
work for the growth of high-speed and 
low-leakage mHEMTs.

MBL grown at different temperatures. 
 
The mobility as a function of the 2DEG 
concentration reveals different results for two 
different growth rates (0.7 μm/hr and 1 μm/hr). 
It’s clearly seen that a lower growth rate leads 
to a higher mobility, as shown in Fig. 5.
