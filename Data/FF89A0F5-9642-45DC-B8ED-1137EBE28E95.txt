shorted-stub inductance in planar configuration. However, 
each lumped-element value in Caloz’ implementation may not 
be independently adjusted and the capacitance and inductance 
components used are strongly dispersive due to parasitic 
elements. To fabricate a wideband bandpass filter with 
arbitrarily controllable response, the independently adjustable 
element values and low-dispersive characteristic are essential. 
To tackle these issues, in this research, a new CRLH unit cell 
is proposed in dual-plane configuration.  
Before introducing the proposed structure, it is essential to 
build up the notion in constructing the passband of a filter 
based on a CRLH-TL unit cell. The filter performance is 
specified by its arithmetic center frequency (f0), fractional 
bandwidth (Δ), and input/output port impedances (Z0). For the 
CRLH-TL unit cell, the lower and higher cutoff frequencies 
are given by fcL and fcR while the series and shunt resonant 
frequencies are by fse and fsh (the definitions of previous four 
frequencies are provided in Table I). It is worth mentioning 
that the seamless transition between RH and LH bands is 
necessary to produce the passband. Therefore, fse is forced to 
be equal to fsh, equivalently, the balanced condition 
LR·CL=LL·CR should be met. Hereafter, the balanced condition 
will be initially assumed in all calculations and designs.

With the filter specification given and the balanced 
condition assumed, one may obtain the required element values 
(i.e., CL, LL, CR, and LR) for the symmetric CRLH-TL unit cell 
by solving the following four simultaneous equations [7],

, where ZR and ZL represent the characteristic impedances of 
purely RH and purely LH TLs, respectively. The first two 
equations in (1) are utilized to ensure the matched condition, 
while the third equation in (1) is used to control the center 
frequency. The fractional bandwidth Δ is dominated by the 
fourth equation in (1) and thus can be arbitrarily assigned in 
contrast to the filters proposed in [1]. Note that only one set of 
reasonable solution can be derived. To demonstrate the 
calculation, the lumped-element values corresponding to the 
filter with f0=3GHz, Δ=50%, ZL=ZR=50Ω are derived and 
detailed in Table I. The associated dispersion diagram is 
obtained according to the Bloch-Floquet theorem based on the 
equivalent T-network in Fig. 2(b) for infinitely periodic 
structure and the calculated result is illustrated in Fig. 3.

Shown in Fig. 1 is the newly proposed realization of the 
symmetric CRLH-TL unit cell revealed in Fig. 2(a). The 
portion of the top microstrip patch overlapping the bottom 
CPW (WCL·DCL) brings about the series capacitance 2CL in the 
series branch while the CPW shorted stubs (WLL·DLL) 
contributes the shunt inductance LL in the parallel branch. 
More precisely, the series inductance LR/2 and shunt 
capacitance CR are taken into consideration to represent the RH 
phenomenon. The thin CPW transmission line with width WLR 
and length DLR gives the required inductance LR/2 and the 
microstrip patch (DCR·WCR) covering the ground gives the 
capacitance CR. Each of the abovementioned lumped-element 
values can be adjusted independently by changing the physical 
dimensions. The overall physical length is denoted by d. Most 
important of all, the proposed dual-metal-plane configuration 
provides less dispersive components comparing with the 
conventional microstrip realization. Using the extraction 
method based on tee- and pi-networks [8], each element value 
corresponding to the unit cell of CRLH-TL can be obtained. 
III. FILTER IMPLEMENTATION 
A. Filter Centered at 3GHz with Δ=50% 
For demonstration, a bandpass filter at geometric center 
frequency f0=3GHz with factional bandwidth 50% is fabricated 
on the low-cost FR4 board (εr=4.4, h=1mm, tanδ=0.02). The 
sample circuit is designed by cascading three CRLH-TL unit 
cells for which the 3D geometry and dimensions are shown in 
Fig. 1. The final circuit needs some fine tuning for optimal 
performance and is fed by two input/output 50Ω microstrip 
lines. The photographs of top-/bottom-plane layouts are 
displayed in Fig. 4(a). It is worth mentioning that bond-wires 
shown in Fig. 1 are replaced by air-bridges composed of 
rectangular patches printed on the top-plane and vias through 
to ground for maintaining precision and avoid variation. The 
overall physical length d of single basic cell is about 12.19mm, 
which is smaller than the guided wavelength of CRLH TL at 
center frequency. The measured and simulated results of this 
filter are illustrated in Fig 4(b). The measured geometric center 
frequency is at 3.13GHz (the arithmetic f0 is 3.04GHz) with Δ 
= 47.6% and the minimum insertion loss is 2.18dB.  
Note that for the three-cell CRLH filter, the return loss is not 
satisfactory enough near the passband edge and should be 
further investigated. By plotting the input impedance Zin given 
below [7],

IV. CONCLUSION 
New CRLH bandpass filters with wide fractional bandwidth 
are proposed in the dual-metal-plane configuration. The 
proposed filters provide wider realizable bandwidth even up to 
100% which is hardly achievable in the conventional approach 
of filter design. Each lumped-element to form the basic CRLH 
cell is almost independently adjustable, thus increasing the 
flexibility in filter design. The proposed dual-plane structure 
significantly facilitates the design of independently adjustable 
low-dispersive quasi-lumped components, especially the 
parallel-plate capacitors.

balanced output become key factor. Figure 1 shows the 
configuration of the adopted dual-plane slotline-based balun. 
For verification, this balun was fabricated on low-cost FR4 
substrate (εr = 4.4, tanδ = 0.02) of thickness 1.6mm. The 
corresponding dimensions are tabulated in Table I. This balun 
has microstrip line as input then transited to slotline by 
shorted-end, finally converted to balanced output using the 
slotline to microstrip transition. The shorted-end slotline on the 
bottom plane are radial shaped to give wideband matching 
characteristics. The connecting via used has radius of 1mm. 
The working principle is quite similar to those transitions 
investigated in [21]. However, the balun has been further 
optimized for our wideband purpose. The balanced output 
ports are P#2 and P#3 on Figure 1(a).

The equivalent circuit of this balun is shown in Figure 1(b) 
for reference, where Z0m, Z0m2 and Z0m3 indicate the 
characteristic impedances of the microstrip lines near P#1, P#2, 
and P#3, respectively, while Z0s represents the impedance of 
the slotline on the bottom plane. The TF1 and TF2 are the 
voltage transformers resulted from the two microstrip-to-
slotline overlapping 3-way T-junctions. The three reactive 
components jXm, jXs1, and jXs2 shown in the equivalent circuit 
are defined in the table on right-handed side of Figure 1(c). By 
appropriately designing those components among the 
equivalent circuit, the input port may be matched and thus 
providing very good balanced output. The uniform slot of the 
balun on the back side with slot width S1 = 0.32mm plays an 
important role to transmit power from P#1 to the balanced 
ports P#2 and P#3. The simulation results of transmission 
coefficients and reflection coefficient are shown in Figure 1(b) 
with satisfactory balanced performance. In balanced 
application, the differential-mode transmission coefficient by 
regarding P#1 as single-ended input and (P#2 & P#3) as 
balanced output should be considered and roughly equal to the 
standard S21 (or S31) in dB plus 3dB under balanced condition 
(since the outputs of port 2 and port 3 are out of phase). 
Since the dipole antenna functions in differential-mode 
condition, the differential-mode output impedance of the balun 
is extremely important to achieve maximum power transfer 
from P#1 (single-ended port 1) to differential-mode port 2 
(single-ended output pair P#2 and P#3). To clarify the 
differential- and common-mode characteristics of the balun, 
the three-port single-ended standard S-parameters are extended 
to mixed-mode S-parameters to gain additional insight into the 
balun [26]. The differential- and common-mode reflection 
coefficients S22dd and S22cc can be calculated, respectively, by

As can be seen from Figure 2(a), considering the differential-

terminated with 50Ohm, it is found the balun not only 
providing low output reactance below 25Ohm from 2.39 GHz 
to 6GHz but also accomplishing pretty good differential-mode 
resistance matching with respect to the attached dipole 
antennas with antenna impedance around 75Ohm especially 
around 4 GHz. On the other hand, the common-mode ports 
possess a great reflection coefficient as illustrated in Fig. 2(b) 
with none of the incident power wave absorbed into the ports.

2.2. Antenna Design 
Figure 3 shows the configuration of the top- and bottom-
plane layouts for the proposed dipole antenna. The antenna is 
principally composed of two series-fed dipole antennas (so 
called lower dipole and upper dipole hereafter). Actually, the 
central portion of the entire antenna will also contribute to the 
radiation on some frequencies and will be discussed later. 
Theoretically speaking, the conventional dipole antenna with 
uniform-shaped antenna functions with currents of two arms 
flowing on opposite directions. It is worth mentioning that the 
adopted dipoles are not of uniform shape but are deformed for 
  10
Figure 7. Therefore, the radiation pattern is expected to be 
omni-directional in yz-plane. In addition, for the 3.5GHz band, 
the upper dipole antenna dominates the radiation and thus 
possesses apparent horizontal current flow. Since the upper 
antenna experiences the ground plane just close to the radiator, 
the radiation pattern will be directional on yz-plane. On the 
higher frequency, i.e. 5.2GHz, the central portion comprises 
stronger x-axis oriented current comparing with upper and 
lower dipoles. The current distribution of 5.2GHz shows multi-
path phenomenon thus making the pattern irregular. The 
observation of current density on specific portion of desired 
frequencies facilitates us to adjust the detailed dimension of the 
proposed antenna.

3. RADIATION PATTERNS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Shown in Figure 8 to Figure 10 are the radiation patterns of 
this wideband dipole antenna for three interested bands 
covering almost the entire frequency range. These frequency 
bands are extraordinarily optimized in the connection both 
with insertion losses depicting in Figure 6 and radiation 
patterns. The selected bands are measured for demonstrating 
the wideband radiating ability of the proposed antenna. The 
radiation pattern of 2.45 GHz is nearly omni-directional. The 
radiation pattern of 3.5 GHz is sort of directional since its 
currents are mostly on the top of dipole antenna. From the 
antenna configuration in Figure 2, the upper portion overlaps 
the ground plane in some region as discussed previously thus 
making the pattern directional in yz-plane. The radiation 
pattern of 5.8 GHz has irregular shape because of some 
currents are upside-down flowing and the overall current 
distribution is multi-directional. The simulated results are 
really similar to the measured results by comparing the 2D 
radiation pattern particular in lower band.

I. INTRODUCTION 
WITH the rapid development in wireless communication, 
multi-band technology has attracted more and more attention 
recently. Therefore, the pursuit of high-performance, multi-
mode components and/or devices has become a key trend in 
the field of research. Basically, the multi-band filters can be 
classified into three categories with regard to their design 
concepts. The first category takes advantage of stepped 
impedance resonators (SIRs) as basic components. SIRs are 
known that they can shift the higher order resonant mode, 
while some approaches also use the higher order frequencies to 
create the another passband [1]-[3]. Dual band filter can be 
achieved by simultaneously satisfying the coupling coefficients 
and external quality factors in both bands. Those multiband 
filters [4]-[5]  classified to second category employ filter 
coupling schemes that share the first and the last resonators 
resonating at their fundamental (f0) and harmonics (fspi, i=1, 
2, …). Among those filters, the signals at different frequencies 
are transmitted through different mainline coupling paths 
composed of different sets of resonators independently 
resonating at f0 and fspi. The third category is to combine 
several BPFs designed at different center frequencies with 
common input and output ports. [6]-[9]. 
In this study, a dual-band filter with wide controllable band 
spacing is designed based on the lumped-distributed design 
procedure and SIRs. The design concept is clearly revealed and 
applicable for higher-order filter. On the foundation of the 
proposed approach, the coupled SIRs can be designed with 
precise center frequency by considering the two attached 
transmission lines on the two sides of extracted impedance 
inverters.

layout. (b) Approximate open-wire equivalent circuit (Z0=1/Y0, Z2=1/Y2, 
Z1=1/Y1, θ1=θ1a+ρL). 
 
II. TYPE-I FILTER DESIGN THEORY 
The proposed type-I dual-band filter principally consists of 
the input/output symmetric anti-parallel coupled line (APCL) 
sections and the impedance (K) inverters using quasi-lumped 
inductors provided by simple short-ended stubs. The lumped-
distributed BPF shown in Fig. 1(a) with its affiliated coupling 
scheme as inset has been investigated in some studies [10][11] 
but without considering the possible dual-band application. 
The approximate but useful open-wire equivalent circuit 
ignoring the parasitic coupling effects for narrowband filter 
design is shown in Fig. 1(b) to facilitate our design flow. The 
2nd-order filter can be designed for dual-band response by 
properly specifying the elements of the equivalent circuit. 
Under resonance condition, the λ/4 SIRs in Fig. 2(a), which are 
resonant components of the filter, can be designed with 
fundamental and 1st higher-order resonances at f0 and fsp1 [1] 
with frequency ratio defined as fsp1/f0. Given the desired filter 
responses for both bands, the corresponding lowpass prototype 
parameters can be acquired as g0k, g1k, g2k, g3k. Obtaining the 
susceptance and reactance slope of λ/4 SIR, the required 
inverter values (i.e. J01, K12, and J23) can be obtained by 
appropriately designing the physical dimension. Before

where Xin is the input reactance seen from shorted end and fn is 
the normalized frequency with respect to fundamental resonant 
frequency. Noteworthily, equations (4) and (5) are actually 
only valid at resonant frequencies f0, fsp1 and other resonances. 
With the inverter values extracted from EM-simulation based 
on (3), the coupling coefficients (C12)k can be simultaneously 
calculated by (4) without any difficulty. 
Moreover, to improve the frequency selectivity, source-load 
coupling except for the main coupling is further introduced 
between input and output transmission lines by simply bending 
the filter into V-shape with bending angle α. Thus, (CSL)k is 
realized for both passbands (k = 1, 2). 
Note that it is of great importance to meet the design 
parameters at each band simultaneously with thorough 
approach. For design convenience, the development procedure 
of the filter is progressively summarized and described below. 
First of all, decide the prescribed filter response for each band 
(filter response, center frequency, and fractional bandwidth) 
and then calculate the related lowpass prototype parameters. 
Secondly, determine the dimensions of ACPL section from Fig. 
4 on the basis of desired fractional bandwidth at each band for 
fulfilling the external quality factor of each band. Thirdly, pick 
the required K12 inverter value from Fig. 5 in accordance with 
the desired fractional bandwidth at each band. The design 
method can easily be adopted using those well-developed 
design charts. 
III. TYPE-I FILTER IMPLEMENTATION 
For demonstration, the type-I dual-band filter is 
implemented on Rogers RO4003C substrate (εr = 3.55, h = 
0.813 mm, tanδ = 0.0027). The SIR has been chosen with 
Rz=1.96 (≈2Ω/Ω), Z1 = 64.16 Ω, Z2 = 123.8 Ω, u≈0.5 as design 
parameters. The impedances ZL and ZR for extracting K12 are 
set equal to Z1. Hence, the calculated electrical lengths θ1 and 
θ2 will both be 54.42o and the frequency ratio of the first higher 
order resonant frequency to the fundamental frequency (fsp1 / f0) 
is 2.31 times. The theoretical reactance slope parameters for 
the two bands are 60.98 and 126.45Ω determined from ideal 
transmission line circuits. However, due to the inevitable 
parasitics and discontinuities caused by large impedance 
difference of the utilized SIRs which are especially significant 
for higher-order resonances, the EM extracted realistic xr1 and 
xr2 then become 59.19 and 140.5 Ω at realistic f0 and fsp1 (2.45 
and 5.34GHz), respectively, will be utilized for our finalized 
calculation and design. 
On the foundation of these extracted and calculated 
parameters, a second-order filter is designed with dual 
passbands (f  I B1 = f0 = 2.45 GHz, Δ1 = 8.8%) and (f  I B2 = fsp1 = 5.34 
GHz, Δ2 = 5.4%) with a Butterworth response. The normalized 
extended coupling matrix [Mnorm] is given by [14]

where MSL denotes the S/L coupling between I/O feed lines and 
the value can be acquired by filter synthesis depending on the 
desired transmission-zero frequencies. The de-normalized 
theoretical external quality factor (QE)k and classical coupling 
coefficient (C12)k for the given specification are tabulated in 
Table I. According to the specified fractional bandwidth for 
both bands, feeding structure with Lc2=10.5mm and g2=0.2 mm 
can be first determined from the point “P” in Fig. 3. In addition, 
we may decide the required quasi-lumped inter-stage coupling 
from the extracted results revealed in Fig. 4. The related EM-
extracted normalized K12/Z1 values are 0.048 and 0.099 with 
selected Dstub1 = 0.95 mm. As can be seen from Table II, the 
simulated K12/Z1 for band 2 has been enlarged to compensate 
the realistic xr2. Those design parameters extracted by full-
wave simulator have been all tabulated in Table II. 
The physical dimensions of the fabricated filter shown in Fig. 
1(a) are W1 = 1.2, L1a = 11.3, W2 = 0.25, L2 = 11.2, L1a = 11.30, 
p1 = 0.7, Wc2 = 0.25, Lc2 = 10.5, Wv = 1.0, Dstub1 = 0.95, Dvs = 
0.9, d = 0.4, g2 = 0.2 mm, and α=31o, respectively. Since all the 
realistic effects including impedance steps and all parasitics are 
taken into consideration in full-wave simulation, the final filter 
has been fine-tuned approximated to the frequency spectrum of 
WLAN (2.45/5.25 GHz) systems. The circuit photograph and 
simulated/measured results are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The 
measurement was carried out by R&S ZVB20 network 
analyzer while the commercial package software, Ansoft 
Designer, was adopted to simulate and further optimize the 
filter structure.

As a result, the measured center frequencies for the two 
bands fB1I and fB2I are slightly shifted to 2.43 and 5.33 GHz 
with 3dB-fractional bandwidths of 8.45% and 5.33%,

個亞洲國家對於該國醫學影像的進展做介紹。除了特別安排的場次之外，各個 Oral Session

很大一部分的疾病診療必須倚靠影像的分析及演算法，然而為了獲得高解析度的影像，往
往需要具游離輻射的成像技術，這也更讓歐美國家的產學界重視到利用微波技術來從事醫

多或少存在著其不可避免的缺點，例如以放射線進行乳房 X 光攝影來偵測乳癌存在著相當

離輻射，對人體造成負擔，醫界開始尋求更低風險的非侵入式醫學成像系統。 
  相對而言，超音波則無暴露在放射線下的危險，然而超音波雖然可以檢測出腫瘤卻無

的前 10呎(成人消化道總長度約為 30呎)，而無法到達小腸。為了克服內視鏡的缺點，因此
筆者發現近年來所謂的吞服式內視成像膠囊開始受到注目，由於其可靠的遠端特性可幫助
臨床醫生獲得可靠的診療資訊用以監測病人的狀態。膠囊影像器主要由小型攝像機、天線、
感測器組成，在這膠囊中天線則成為達成射頻鏈路的重要元件。 
 由以上的敘述可知，射頻微波技術已經開始在醫學工程領域受到重視。基本而言，微
波影像是身體組織的電氣特性分布，而電氣特性的改變某種程度而言也意指組織內部的熱
累積，我們之所以能利用微波來偵測癌症也在於健康組織與惡性組織之間的電氣特性有所
不同。近來其應用尤其特別廣泛應用於乳癌的偵測，因為影像演算法的改善、微波的硬體
改良等等好處。若從外部進行微波成像的技術而言，相關於使用半硬管單偶極天線、Vivaldi
天線、金字塔型號角天線及領結天線業已開始出現在各類研究中。 
 本次投稿此會議主要在於能夠初步了解目前國際間對於醫學成像研究的主要方向，並
能由其中獲得啟發。參與本次會議的過程中我發現目前的醫學影像技術主流仍然在於
MRI、CT、Ultrasound等等較常見之技術，說到將射頻微波技術應用在體內影像的造影或者
是吞服式膠囊內資料的射頻傳輸，則相對而言較為少見，這也代表著這塊領域仍亟需微波
領域界的專家學者們加入共同參與研究。因此筆者往後對於將天線設計整合進微型化膠
囊，考慮人體組織對於射頻訊號傳輸的影響，研究能用最小的功率消耗在膠囊系統內達成
最佳的射頻訊號傳輸。

  參加此次會議的結果讓筆者發覺，雖然國際間已有相關於微波醫學影像的技術在陸續
發表，然而似乎在亞洲國家仍是較為忽略這塊領域，歐美國家目前在射頻微波領域仍是十
分注重前瞻且實用之技術，微波技術可以減少病人暴露在接受檢查之後接觸暴露在游離輻
