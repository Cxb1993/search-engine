Abstract 
 
IEEE 802.11 is currently the most popular %has become the de facto MAC (medium access control) standard for 
mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). On the other hand, clustering in MANETs is a promising technique to ensure the 
scalability of various communication protocols. Thus we propose an optimal asymmetric and maximized adaptive 
power management protocol, called OAMA, for 802.11-based clustered MANETs, which has the following attractive 
features. (i) Given the length of schedule repetition interval (SRI), the duty cycles of both clusterheads and members 
reach the theoretical minimum. (ii) Under the minimum duty cycle constraints, the numbers of tunable SRIs for both 
clusterheads and members reach the theoretical maximum. (iii) By means of factor-correlative coterie-plane product, 
OAMA guarantees bounded-time neighbor discovery between the clusterhead and its member, and between all 
clusterheads, regardless of stations' individual SRIs and the schedule offset between neighboring stations. (iv) The 
time complexity of OAMA neighbor maintenance is O(1). (v) OAMA adopts a cross-layer SRI adjustment scheme 
such that stations can adaptively tune the values of SRI to maximize energy conservation according to flow timeliness 
requirements. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that OAMA substantially outperforms existing 
power management protocols for clustered MANETs, including AQEC and ACQ, in terms of duty cycle, adaptiveness, 
data delay dropped ratio, network lifetime, and end-to-end energy throughput.

Fig. 2. An example of the neighbor maintenance in CQPM. In this
example, both H0 and H2 obey the CQPM protocols [13], [28], [31] to set
their respective ABI-sets. Specifically, (SH0 ,A(SH0 )) = (7, {0, 1, 3}) and
(SH2 ,A(SH2 )) = (21, {0, 3, 4, 9, 11}). However, when the schedule ofH0
leads that of H1 by 2 BIs, H0 and H2 forever lose each other’s beacon/ATIM
frames. Some arrows representing the beacon frames are ignored for clarity.
power management (CQPM for short) protocols to improve
the results of [23]. In CQPM, there are typically two types
of BIs: one is the awake BI (ABI) and the other is the
sleep BI (SBI). Referring to Fig. 2, the ABI starts with the
ATIM window, during which a PS station remains awake and
broadcasts its beacon frame. On the other hand, a PS station
may doze off during the entire SBI. When a station switches
to the PS mode, it chooses a quorum qi ⊆ {0, 1, · · · , S − 1}
from the cyclic quorum system Q = {q0, q1, · · · , qS−1} as
its ABIs in a schedule repetition interval (SRI), while the
remaining BIs are all SBIs, where SRI = S means that
the S consecutive BIs that constitute the specific ABI/SBI
pattern repeat regularly. Take Fig. 2 for example, S = 7 and
Q = {q0 = {0, 1, 3}, q1 = {1, 2, 4}, q2 = {2, 3, 5}, q3 =
{3, 4, 6}, q4 = {4, 5, 0}, q5 = {5, 6, 1}, q6 = {6, 0, 2}}. Both
stations H0 and H1 select the q0 = {0, 1, 3}-th BIs as their
ABIs in every consecutive 7 BIs. By rotation closure property
[13], CQPM ensures that two PS neighbors, H0 and H1,
are able to hear each other’s beacons (and thus discover
each other) in finite time, regardless of the schedule offset1,
∆(H0,H1), between them.
Let us define the ABI-set A(S) and ABI-ratio α(S) as
the set of the positions of ABIs in an SRI S, and the ratio
of the cardinality of A(S) to S, respectively. Intuitively, the
larger the ABI-ratio (also called duty cycle, the fraction of
time a station stays awake), the more frequently the station
wakes up, the shorter data reception delay and neighbor
discovery time the station may perceive. On the other hand,
the smaller the ABI-ratio, the less frequently the station wakes
up, the more battery power the station can save. Hence we
hope that a PS station can adaptively adjust its ABI-ratio
and SRI according to its battery power status or other QoS
(quality-of-service) considerations. Fig. 2 depicts that, if PS
stations can have different values of ABI-ratio and SRI, then
these CQPM protocols [13], [28], [31] may completely fail.
Therefore, the authors of [3] proposed an adaptive power
1With the wide spread of GPS [9] and the availability of industrial-strength
clock synchronization mechanisms [32], [33], we assume that the TBTTs of
all stations are aligned. After reading subsection II-C, readers can understand
that our proposed protocol, called OAMA, can operate in an asynchronous
MANET as well. Please notice that the alignment of TBTT does not imply
that neighboring stations have no schedule offset.

management protocol, called AQEC (Adaptive Quorum-based
Energy Conserving), to overcome this flaw. Referring to Fig.
3, in AQEC2, the consecutive BIs in an SRI S are arranged
as a
√
S × √S grid in a row-major fashion, where √S is
an integer. Each PS station selects one row and one column
from a gird of arbitrary size
√
S×√S as its ABIs, while the
residual BIs are SBIs. By grid-quorum property [3], AQEC
ensures that two neighbors, H0 and H1, can discover each
other in finite time regardless of their offset ∆(H0,H1) and
individual SRIs.
Recently, [27] pointed out that, in clustered MANETs [4],
[25], there is no need for a quorum-based power management
to insist the overlap property between every pairs of PS
stations. Referring to Fig. 4, by only guaranteeing the overlap
of ABIs between each cluster member and its clusterhead,
and between neighboring clusterheads, the whole MANET
can still function well since each member may count on its
clusterhead to forward data to the intended destination. On
the basis of this principle, [27] proposed the first asymmetric
power management (APM for short) protocol, called ACQ
(Asymmetric Cyclic Quorum), in which the ABI-ratio of the
cluster member αM(S) is smaller than that of its clusterhead
αH(S). Since cluster members are the major population in
an clustered MANET, this implies that APM may be more
energy-efficient than symmetric power management, where
both clusterheads and members adopt the same ABI-sets
construction rules. Specifically, in ACQ, given SRI S and an
integer 1 ≤ φ ≤ S, the clusterhead employs the following rule
to build its ABI-set AH(S).
AH(S) = {0, 1, · · · , φ− 1, s1, s2, · · · , sq−1}, (1)
where q = ⌈(S+1)/2φ⌉, φ−1 < s1 ≤ 2φ−1, 0 < si−si−1 ≤
φ, and sq−1 ≥ (S − 1)/2. By contrast, the cluster member in
ACQ employs the following rule to build its ABI-set AM(S).
AM(S) = {a0, a1, · · · , ap−1}, (2)
where p = ⌈S/φ⌉, a0 = 0, 0 < ai − ai−1 ≤ φ, and 0 <
S − ap−1 ≤ φ. Remark that although APM poses heavier
duty cycle on the clusterhead, this problem can be solved by
the periodical clusterhead re-election [4] or virtual backbone
rotation [19].
Thus compared with AQEC and ACQ, we can make the
following observations: (i) From the viewpoint of adaptive-
2Here we assume that AQEC performs neighbor maintenance since [7]
indicated that, without neighbor maintenance, AQEC may waste significant
energy on blindly sending the ATIM frames.

called divisors) of Si. We require
⋃r
k=1A(dk) ⊆ A(Si) for
all Si ∈ S . P3) Let ω = max{ gcd(Si, Rj) | for all Si ∈ S
and Rj ∈ R}. Then for all Si ∈ S , we require {0 mod Si, 1
mod Si, · · · , ω − 1 mod Si} ⊆ A(Si).
The neighbor maintenance procedure of OAMA operates as
follows. As shown in Fig.5, every station stores two tables: one
is the clusterhead ABI-set table {(Si,A(Si))} and the other
is the member SRI-set table R, both of which together form
the factor-correlative coterie-plane product. Referring to Fig.
6, a PS station in OAMA can adjust the length of SRI only at
the start of each SRI. Once the value of SRI is determined,
the PS station playing the role of clusterhead (or gateway)
shall consult the clusterhead ABI-set table to set the positions
of ABIs and SBIs in the SRI, while the station playing the
role of cluster member sets only the zeroth BI as its ABI in
the SRI. Fig. 6 depicts an example where the cluster member,
M0, and clusterheads, H0 and H1, arrange their individual
ABI/SBI schedules according to the OAMA protocol. Note
that although deriving the optimal tables for {(Si,A(Si))}
and R may need exhaustive search, the time complexity of
OAMA neighbor maintenance is O(1) since it involves only
table lookup operations and the table size is constant. Above
all, we have the following important results.
Theorem 2. Given bounded Smax, OAMA guarantees that two
neighboring clusterheads, H0 and H1, can discover each other
in bounded time regardless of their schedule offset ∆(H0,H1)
as well as their respective SRIs, SH0 and SH1 .
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that the schedule
of H0 leads that of H1 by ∆(H0,H1) = t (in units of BI). Be-
sides, H0 and H1 choose (SH0 ,A(SH0)) and (SH1 ,A(SH1))
as their respective (SRI, ABI-set). We know that the chance
for neighboring clusterheads to discover each other relies on
the overlap of their ABIs. Hence we claim that, in bounded
time, one of H0’s ABIs will meet one of H1’s ABIs. Before
proceeding with the proof, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let {(Si,A(Si))} be the clusterhead ABI-set table.
Given integers t and Si, there must exist two integers β1 and
β2 in A(Si) such that β1 ≡ t+ β2 (mod Si).

Fig. 6. An example of the neighbor maintenance in OAMA. Here we assume
the schedule offset ∆(H0,M0) between H0 and M0 is 2 (in units of BI).
According to Fig. 5, PS station H1 selects the {0, 1, 3, 6}-th BIs as its ABIs
within every consecutive 10 BIs. Since the factors of 10 include 1, 2, and 5,
OAMA requires A(1) ⊆ A(10), A(2) ⊆ A(10), and A(5) ⊆ A(10).
Proof. By P1, A(Si) ∩ (−t ⊕ A(Si)) ̸= ∅. So we assume
β ∈ {A(Si) ∩ (−t⊕A(Si))}. This implies that there must
exist an element β∗ in A(Si) so that β = −t+ β∗ (mod Si).
Let β1 = β∗ and β2 = β. This lemma thus follows. 
From Fig. 6, we can find that if one of H0’s ABIs and one
of H1’s ABIs can mutually meet each other, there must exist
some bH0 ∈ A(SH0) and bH1 ∈ A(SH1) so that the following
system of congruences has positive integer solutions x.{
x ≡ bH0 (mod SH0)
x ≡ t+ bH1 (mod SH1) (5)
Take Fig. 6 for example, H0’s 0th BI (also ABI) and H1’s
3rd BI (also ABI) can meet each other at the 7th reference BI
since 7 ≡ 0 (mod 7) and 7 ≡ 4 + 3 (mod 10).
Let g = gcd(SH0 , SH1). According to generalized Chinese
remainder theorem, equation (5) has infinitely many positive
integer solutions if and only if bH0 ≡ t + bH1 (mod g). By
Lemma 1, we know that, for any integer t, there must exist two
integers β1 and β2 in A(g) such that β1 ≡ t+β2 (mod g). By
P2, we have A(g) ⊆ A(SH0) and A(g) ⊆ A(SH1). Theorem
2 hence follows by letting bH0 = β1 ∈ A(SH0) and bH1 =
β2 ∈ A(SH1). 
Theorem 3. Given bounded Smax, OAMA guarantees that
each cluster member M0 and its clusterhead H0 can discover
each other in bounded time regardless of their schedule offset
∆(H0,M0) as well as their respective SRIs, RM0 and SH0 .
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that the schedule
of H0 leads that of M0 by ∆(H0,M0) = t (in units of BI).
Since cluster member M0 selects only the 0th BI as its ABI in
the SRI RM0 , if stations M0 and H0 can discover each other,
there must exist some bH0 ∈ A(SH0) such that the following
system of congruences has positive integer solutions y.{
y ≡ bH0 (mod SH0)
y ≡ t (mod RM0) (6)
Take Fig.6 for example, M0’s 0th BI (also ABI) and H0’s 3rd
BI (also ABI) can meet each other at the 10th reference BI
since 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7) and 10 ≡ 2 (mod 4).

Lemma 2 and Fig. 9, we know that two adjacent ABIs are

S is the SRI of a clusterhead. Hence L ≤ ⌈Smax/2⌉.
III. PROTOCOL ANALYSIS
From the viewpoint of MAC layer, the ABI-ratio, adaptive-
ness, beacon overhead, and average neighbor discovery time
are used to judge the goodness of a power management pro-
tocol [3], [13], [28]. In this section, we provide performance
comparisons among AQEC, ACQ, and OAMA in regard to
these metrics.
Theorem 4. Let {(Si,A(Si))} be the clusterhead ABI-set
table in OAMA. We have |A(Si)| ≤ ⌈
√
Si⌉+1. This implies
that the ABI-ratio of the clusterhead is αH(Si) ≈ 1/
√
Si.
Proof Sketch. Referring to Fig. 5, it is easy to verify that, in
OAMA, the number of ABIs in an SRI, |A(Si)|, is no more
than ⌈√Si⌉+ 1 for all Si ∈ S = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, 23}.
Especially, when Si is a prime and of the form κ2 + κ + 1,
where κ is a prime power, the ABI-set A(Si) in fact forms
a line in the cyclic finite projective plane [28]. In this case,
|A(Si)| = κ+ 1 = ⌈
√
κ2 + κ+ 1 ⌉ = ⌈√Si⌉. 
Theorem 5. Let {(Si,A(Si))} be the clusterhead ABI-set
table and R be the member SRI-set table in OAMA. More-
over, we denote by θH(Smax) and θM(Smax) the numbers
of tunable SRIs for clusterheads and members, respectively.
For Smax ≥ 7, the adaptiveness of OAMA is θ(Smax) =
θH(Smax)× θM(Smax) > 9S

max
16 ln2 Smax
.
Proof. By P3, given {(Si,A(Si))} and R, we require that, for
all Si ∈ S , A(Si) include {0 mod Si, 1 mod Si, · · · , ω− 1
mod Si}, where ω = max{ gcd(Si, Rj) | for all Si ∈ S and
Rj ∈ R}. From [17], we can observe that, for all primes
Si, the minimal-set A(Si) satisfying only P1 contains {0, 1}.
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic [21], every integer
greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes. Hence the
set A(Si) satisfying both P1 and P2, for all integers Si ≥ 2,
must include {0, 1}. Thus we can let ω = 2.
The remaining issue is how to construct two sets S and R
such that the product of |S| and |R| is maximized, subject
to the constraints that (i) both S and R are the subsets of
{1, 2, · · · , Smax}, (ii) gcd(Si, Rj) ≤ 2 for Si ∈ S and Rj ∈
R. The following provides a simple systematic way to find
out the feasible solutions of S and R.
S1. Let P1 = { p and 2p | p is a prime and p ≤ ⌊Smax/2⌋}
and P2 = { p | p is a prime and ⌊Smax/2⌋ < p ≤ Smax}.
S2. For each i ∈ {1, 2}, evenly partition Pi into two disjoint
subsets Q˜i and Q̂i. Note that, given p ≤ ⌊Smax/2⌋, both
p and 2p must be either in Q˜1 or in Q̂1.
S3. S = {1, 2} ∪ Q˜1 ∪ Q˜2 and R = {1, 2} ∪ Q̂1 ∪ Q̂2.
For example, let Smax = 25. We have P1 = {2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 10,
7, 14, 11, 22} and P2 = {13, 17, 19, 23}. The partition of
P1 could be Q˜1 = {2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14} and Q̂1 = {3, 6, 11, 22}.
In addition, the partition of P2 could be Q˜2 = {19, 23} and
Q̂2 = {13, 17}. Note that the solutions of S and R are not
unique. Now, we claim that |S| × |R| > 9S2max/16 ln2 Smax.
Let pi(S) be the number of primes that do not exceed the
integer S. According to prime number theorem [2], pi(S) >
S/ lnS for all S ≥ 7. Obviously, |P1| = 2 · pi(⌊Smax/2⌋) and
|P2| = pi(Smax)− pi(⌊Smax/2⌋). Thus when Smax ≥ 7,
θ(Smax) = θH(Smax)× θM(Smax) = |S| × |R|

Combining Theorems 4 and 5 leads to the following result.
Theorem 6. The OAMA is optimal and maximized adaptive.
Now we explore the beacon overhead issue. Although Fig.
7 shows that the beacon frame in OAMA is larger than that
in 802.11 by 15 bytes, we have the following positive result.
Theorem 7. Let B and B′ denote the size of a beacon frame in
802.11 and OAMA, respectively. A station in OAMA with an
ABI-ratio smaller than B/B′ consumes less beacon overhead
than that in 802.11. In our simulations, we set B = 50 bytes
and B′ = 65 bytes. This implies that when the SRI is greater
than 2, OAMA consumes less beacon overhead than 802.11.
Proof. Let C be the channel bit rate and BI be the length
of a BI. In OAMA, a station with SRI S and ABI-ratio α(S)
consumes bandwidth WOAMA = α(S) × B′C×BI on sending
beacon frames in an SRI S. Clearly, W802.11 = BC×BI . Thus
when α(S) < B/B′, we have WOAMA < W802.11. From Fig.
5, we can see that when S > 2, α(S) < B/B′ = 50/65. 
Then we investigate the average neighbor discovery time.
We define the common awake BIs (CABIs) between stations
H0 and H1 as the reference BIs when both H0 and H1 are
in ABIs. Take Fig. 6 for example, the 7th reference BI is the
CABI between H0 and H1. Assume that H0 and H1 select
SH0 and SH1 as their SRIs, respectively. The average neighbor
discovery time τ(SH0 , SH1) between H0 and H1 is formally
defined as follows.
τ(SH0 , SH1) = lim
∆t→∞

Theorem 8. Let {(Si,A(Si))} be the clusterhead ABI-set
table in OAMA. Then the average neighbor discovery time
8than (⌈SH1/2⌉ + 1)BI − AW , where BI and AW are the
lengths of BI and ATIM window, respectively.
Proof. Once H0 discovered H1, H0 can henceforth predict
when H1 will wake up. Referring to Fig.6, the maximum data
frame transfer delay from H0 to H1 occurs when H0 has data
for H1 at the close of H1’s ATIM window (time t1), H0 waits
for the maximum number of consecutive SBIs (from time t2
to t3), and finally finishes the data transfer in H1’s next ABI
(at time t4). Under such circumstances, we have
ξ(SH1) = (t2 − t1) + (t3 − t2) + (t4 − t3)
= (BI −AW ) + (γ(SH1)− 1)BI +BI
≤ (⌈SH1/2⌉+ 1)BI −AW,
where γ(SH1) ≤ ⌈SH1/2⌉ follows by Lemma 2. 
Theorem 11. In a non-congested cluster, the maximum data
frame transfer delay ξ(RM0) from the clusterhead H0 to its
discovered member M0 that selects RM0 ∈ R as its SRI is
(RM0 + 1)BI − AW , where BI and AW are the lengths of
BI and ATIM window, respectively.
Proof. The proof is identical to that of Theorem 10 except
that we replace (SH1 ,A(SH1)) with (RM0 , {0}). 
Theorems 10 and 11 provide the data transfer delay bound
only for a non-congested cluster. In a congested cluster, the
OAMA data frame transfer procedure will force both sending
and receiving stations to remain awake across multiple BIs
(some of which may be originally SBIs) until communication
is not needed. By this way, we ensure that when the data
arrival rate is less than receiver’s maximum service rate (i.e.,
the effective SRI becomes one), the data transfer delay from
H0 to discovered neighbors H1 and M0 can be bounded by
ξ(SH1) and ξ(RM0), respectively.
Now, we show how to integrate OAMA with a geographic
routing protocol, called GPSR3 (Greedy Perimeter Stateless
Routing) [14], so that PS stations along the routing path can
adjust the values of SRI in response to the flow timeliness
requirement. Please notice that OAMA is orthogonal to any
cluster management and routing protocols. The choice of
GPSR is primarily because of its simplicity and the freedom
of dead-end problem4 [14]. We assume that each station
piggybacks the remaining energy and location information on
the beacon frame. In OAMA, the clusterheads and members
by default set the values of SRI to maxS∈S{S | S ≤ Smax}
and maxS∈R{S | S ≤ Smax}, respectively. When the source
station X intends to transmit a data flow to the destination Y
whose location is known in advanced, it forwards the RREQ
(route request) packet specifying its tolerable delay Tdelay to
the neighboring clusterhead whose residual energy is highest
and whose location is closer to the destination. If no such
clusterhead can be found, X enters the perimeter-mode [14]
and forwards that RREQ to the appropriate clusterhead by
using the localized planar-graph traversal techniques [14].
3For a detailed description on GPSR, please refer to [14].
4The dead-end problem here arises when greedy forwarding fails at a clus-
terhead that is closer to the destination than all its neighboring clusterheads.
Upon reception of the RREQ packet, if the receiving station
is not the destination, it appends its address to the RREQ and
then propagates that RREQ towards the destination. Assume
that RREQ travels from the source X , through clusterheads
Hk1 ,Hk2 , · · · ,Hkn , and finally to the destination Y . Y first
checks whether the following inequality can be satisfied.
Υ = (n+ 1)(2BI −AW ) ≤ Tdelay. (14)
If not, this means that even all stations along the routing
path set SRI S = 1, the tolerable delay Tdelay still cannot
be fulfilled. In this case, Y replies the RREJ (route rejection)
packet attaching Υ back to the source. The source station can
either abort the flow setup or revise the value of Tdelay based
on Υ and then attempt the above procedure again.
If so, Y should determine the values of SHk1 , · · · , SHkn ,
and SY such that the following inequality can be satisfied.
ξ(SHk1 ) + · · ·+ ξ(SHkn ) + ξ(SY ) ≤ Tdelay. (15)
[18], [24] have proven that the problem of finding minimum
energy routes in a MANET without violating delay constraints
is NP-complete. Thus we design a simple heuristic method to
quickly determine the feasible solutions of SHk1 , · · · , SHkn ,
and SY . To balance the power consumption, we hope that all
stations along the path use roughly the same SRI. If SHki =
SY = S
∗ for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, inequality (15) can be reworded
as follows.
(n+ 1)
[(⌈S∗2 ⌉+ 1)BI −AW] ≤ Tdelay,
if Y is a clusterhead,
n
[(⌈S∗2 ⌉+ 1)BI −AW]+ (S∗ + 1)BI −AW ≤ Tdelay,
if Y is a clusterhead member.
To maximize S∗ (and thus minimize the ABI-ratio), we let
S∗=

2
⌊
Tdelay−(n+1)(BI−AW )
(n+1)BI
⌋
, if Y is a clusterhead,
2
⌊
Tdelay−(n+1)(BI−AW )
(n+2)BI
⌋
, if Y is a member.
(16)
However, the value of S∗ may not satisfy Definition 1. Let
SH = maxS∈S{S |S ≤ S∗} and SM = maxS∈R{S |S ≤ S∗}.
If Y is a clusterhead, it sets SY = SH if its current SRI is
greater than SH. If Y is a cluster member, it sets SY = SM
if its current SRI is greater than SM. Besides, Y replies the
RREP (route reply) packet attaching SH back to the source
station in the reverse direction. Every clusterhead along this
path changes the SRI value to SH only when its current SRI
is larger than SH. Once the source station received the RREP,
it can commence the data flow transmission. After finishing
the data flow transmission, the source station sends the RREL
(route release) packet to the destination. Upon receipt of the
RREL, if a clusterhead needs not to forward any flows, it can
switch the value of SRI to maxS∈S{S | S ≤ Smax}.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

We have developed customized event-driven simulators us-
ing Visual C to compare the performances of OAMA to those
of AQEC and ACQ. An area of size 700 m × 700 m is

flow, its upstream clusterhead, say H0, cannot know the up-
to-date ABI/SBI schedule of H1 until H0 receives a new
beacon from H1. This will increase the data buffering time at
H0. Fortunately, from Theorem 8, we know that the average
neighbor discovery time between neighboring clusterheads is
only sublinearly proportional to the SRI. Thus the DDDR of
OAMA is expectably small. Fig. 12 depicts that the DDDRs
of AQEC and ACQ steeply increase as the flow timeliness
requirement decreases. This implies that AQEC and ACQ are
not suitable for delay-sensitive applications. The main reason
the DDDR of AQEC is much larger than that of ACQ is as
follows. In AQEC, the clusterheads adjust the values of SRI
according to the observed traffic load. Since PS stations do not
wake up very often, they can hardly derive the actual arrival
rates of the flows. Fig. 13 shows that during the ON periods
of a flow, the SRI value of a clusterhead oscillates rapidly and
sharply. This easily leads to the situation that the upstream
clusterhead frequently predicts the wrong ABI/SBI schedule
of the downstream clusterhead, causing the huge DDDR.
C. Survival Ratio
We use the survival ratio to measure the energy saving
ability of a power management protocol, where the survival
ratio is defined as the number of surviving stations (with
nonzero energy) over the total number of stations. We assume
that the initial energy of every station is 100 Joule. From
Fig. 14, we can see that since, in OAMA, the ABI-ratios of
both clusterheads and cluster members reach the theoretical
minimum, the network lifetime of OAMA can be 243%,
169%, and 225% times that of ACQ1, ACQ2, and AQEC,
respectively. This implies that OAMA is more suitable than
ACQ and AQEC for energy-limited applications, in which

stations are subject to hard constraints on available battery
energy. Fig. 14 also shows that ACQ2 has a longer network
lifetime than AQEC. This is because ACQ2 has an apparent
asymmetric advantage over AQEC (i.e., in ACQ2, a cluster
member has a much smaller ABI-ratio than a clusterhead).
On the other hand, when the traffic load is light (especially
during the OFF periods), stations in AQEC tend to use the
large values of SRI. Besides, a station with maximum SRI
in AQEC has a smaller ABI-ratio than a cluster member in
ACQ1. Hence the network lifetime of AQEC can be longer
than that of ACQ1.
D. End-to-End Energy Throughput
Next, we investigate the end-to-end energy throughput of
AQEC, ACQ, and OAMA under various flow delay require-
ments. The end-to-end energy throughput is defined by divid-
ing the amount of data sent from sources to destinations in
flow delay constraints by the total energy consumption of all
stations. The authors of [12] pointed out that using energy
throughput to judge the goodness of a power management
protocol is fairer than using total power consumption since
some power management protocols may consume very little
energy, but also attain very little throughput. Fig. 15 depicts
that the end-to-end energy throughputs of ACQ and AQEC

the routing path, thus increasing the DDDR. Fortunately, Fig.
20 shows that even in the presence of station mobility, the
DDDR of OAMA can be close to that of ACQ1 and smaller
than that of ACQ2.
G. Beacon Overhead
Theorem 7 compares the beacon overhead between 802.11
and OAMA from the viewpoint of bandwidth consumption.
This subsection compares the beacon overhead among ACQ,
AQEC, OAMA, and 802.11 from the viewpoint of power
consumption. As expected, Fig. 21 displays that the beacon
overheads of all these protocols increase as the number of
stations increases. Both OAMA and ACQ have roughly the
same beacon overhead. Moreover, AQEC has the lowest bea-
con overhead since when the traffic load is light (especially
during the OFF periods), stations in AQEC tend to use the
large SRI values. By contrast, 802.11 has the highest beacon
overhead since each PS station needs to broadcast its beacon
frame in every BI.
H. Effect of Station Density
In this experiment, we vary the total number of stations
from 100 to 300. Since the simulated network area is fixed,

this parameter reflects the station density of the network. We
first explore the relationship between the DDDR and station
density. Since only clusterheads can forward packets and the
traffic load does not change, this experiment is equivalent to
examine the impact of beacon contention. Fig. 22 shows that
a higher station density has a negative effect on DDDR of
AQEC and ACQ, but insignificantly influence OAMA. The
reasons are as follows. When the network becomes denser,
the beacon collision probability will increase. Under such
situations, stations in AQEC are harder to obtain the newly
modified ABI/SBI schedule information from neighbors, thus
rising the DDDR of AQEC. In ACQ, stations need to change
the ABI/SBI schedules when they change the roles. Hence
beacon collisions still adversely affect the DDDR of ACQ.
OAMA effectively alleviates this problem by employing our
scalable beacon broadcast procedure [28], which guarantees a
nearly 90% success probability of a beacon broadcast even in
a very dense/large MANET.
Next, we explore the relationship between the station den-
sity and network lifetime, which is defined as the time until a
χ percentage of the stations fail due to battery depletion [15].
Here we let χ = 50. From Fig. 23, we can see that a higher
station density has a positive effect on the network lifetime
of OAMA and ACQ2, while it does not influence AQEC and
ACQ1. We know that cluster members are the major popula-

目前 multi-hop MANET 裡頭最受歡迎的國際標準為 IEEE 802.11。然而 802.11 要求

（英文）IEEE 802.11 is currently the most popular medium access 
control (MAC) standard for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). On 
the other hand, clustering in MANETs is a promising technique to 
ensure the scalability of various communication protocols. Thus,we 
propose an optimal asymmetric and maximized adaptive power 
management protocol, called OAMA, for 802.11-based clustered 
MANETs, which has the following attractive features.  
1) Given the length of schedule repetition interval (SRI), the duty 
cycles of both clusterheads and members reach the theoretical 
minimum.  
2) Under the minimum duty cycle constraints, the numbers of tunable 
SRIs for clusterheads and members reach the theoretical maximum.  
3) By means of factor-correlative coterie-plane product, OAMA 
guarantees bounded-time neighbor discovery between the clusterhead 
and its member, and between all clusterheads, regardless of stations’ 
individual SRIs and the schedule offset between neighboring stations. 
4) The time complexity of OAMA neighbor maintenance is O(1).  
5) OAMA adopts a cross-layer SRI adjustment scheme such that 
stations can adaptively tune the values of SRI to maximize energy 
conservation according to flow timeliness requirements.
