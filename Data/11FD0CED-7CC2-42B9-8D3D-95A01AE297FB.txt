 ABSTRACT: A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of novel, amphiphilic block–graft 
MPEG-b-(PaN3CL-g-alkyne) degradable copolymers. First, the ring-opening polymerization of 
a-chloro-e-caprolactone (α ClCL) was initiated by hydroxy-terminated macroinitiator monomethoxy 
poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) with SnOct2 as the catalyst. In a second step, pendent chlorides were 
converted into azides by the reaction with sodium azide. Finally, various kinds of terminal alkynes were 
reacted with pendent azides by copper-catalyzed Huisgen’s 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, and thus a ‘‘click’’ 
reaction. These copolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 
1
H NMR, IR, 
and gel permeation chromatography. By fixing the length of the MPEG block and increasing the length 
of PaClCL (or PaN3CL) block, an increase tendency in Tgs was observed. However, the copolymers of 
MPEGb-PaClCL and MPEG-b-PaN3CL were semicrystalline when the Mn of MPEG was above 2000 g 
mol1. The block–graft copolymers formed micelles in the aqueous phase with critical micelle 
concentrations (CMCs) in the range of 1.4–12.0 mg L
1 
depending on the composition of polymers. The 
lengths of hydrophilic segment influence the shape of the micelle. The mean hydrodynamic diameters of 
the micelles from dynamic light scattering were in the range of 90–160 nm. In vitro hydrolytic 
degradation of block–graft copolymers is faster than the corresponding block copolymers. The drug 
entrapment efficiency and the drug loading content of micelles depending on the composition of 
block–graft polymers were described.

INTRODUCTION  
Amphiphilic copolymers are well-known for self-assembly 
into micelles or larger aggregates in selective solvents for 
one block. In aqueous solutions, a core-shell structure is 
commonly formed  
The poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block is known for 
biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and water solubility at 
moderate temperatures.6 Poly(ethylene

Determination of the Drug Loading Content and
Drug Entrapment Efﬁ ciency  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Synthesis of the MPEG-b-Pα ClCL Diblock 
Copolymers  
Using oil-in-water solvent evaporation, 
MPEG-b-(PaN3CL-g-alkyne) (10 mg) was dissolved in 6 
mL methylene chloride followed by adding AM with 
various weight ratios to polymer (0.25/11/ 1) served as 
model drug. The solution was added dropwise to 150 mL 
distilled water containing 1 wt % poly(vinyl alcohol) under 
vigorous stirring. Poly (vinyl alcohol) was used as a 
surfactant to reduce the aggregation of micelle. Droplet size 
was reduced by sonication at ambient temperature for 60 
min. The emulsion was stirred at ambient temperature for 
overnight to evaporate methylene chloride. The aggregated 
AM-loaded micelles were removed by centrifugation (3000 
rpm 3 30 min). Then, the aqueous micellar solution was 
dried at room temperature by vacuum rotary evaporator. 
The unloaded AM was eliminated by washing three times 
with distilled water, because the solubility of AM in water 
is very large than the block copolymer and micelle. The 
micelles were obtained by vacuum drying. A weighed 
amount of micelle was disrupted by the addition of 
acetonitrile (10 mL). Drug content was assayed 
spectrophotometrically at 240 nm using a Diode Array 
UV–vis spectrophotometer. The drug-loading content and 
drug entrapment efficiency were calculated by eqs 1 and 2, 
respectively:  
Various amphiphilic MPEG-b-PaClCL diblock copolymers 
were synthesized by ROP of αClCL with 
hydroxyl-terminated macroinitiators MPEGs containing the 
number-average molecular weight 550, 2000, and 5000 g 
mol1. The synthesis of amphiphilic MPEG-b-PaClCL block 
copolymers is illustrated in Scheme 1. The hydroxyl group 
of MPEG was used as the initiation site for the ROP of 
aClCL in the presence of SnOct2  
(1.5 wt %) as the catalyst at reflux with toluene for 48 h. 
The results of the polymerization are compiled in Table 1. 
The yields between 70 and 90% were high. Mns of the 
block copolymers obtained from the copolymerization of 
aClCL and MPEG increased with the increase of the molar 
ratios of aClCL to MPEG in feed. When the MPEG12 was 
used as the macroinitiator, the molar ratios ofα ClCL to 
MPEG12 in feed increase from 10 to 50, the Mns of the 
copolymer increase from 2130 to 6850 g mol1 with Mw/Mn 
between 1.35 and 1.59. Similarly, if the MPEG45 was used 
as the macroinitiator, the Mns of the block copolymers 
increased with the increase of the molar ratios ofα ClCL to 
MPEG45 in feed. The molar ratio of the compositions in 
the block copolymers was analyzed by 1H NMR. The 
amounts of comonomer incorporated into the copolymer 
could be calculated from a comparison of integral area of 
the resonance peaks δ =1.91–2.09 ppm of the C3 meth-
ylene protons of Pα ClCL with the resonance peaksδ =
3.35 ppm of the terminal methoxy protons of MPEG. From 
the 1H NMR analysis, the conversion of copolymerization 
of the monomers was in agreement with the corresponding

weight of micelles)×100(1)

In Vitro Degradation  
feeds. Typical NMR spectrum of the block copolymer 
MPEG45-b-Pα ClCL39 is shown in Figure 1(A). The 
resonance peaks are assigned to the corresponding hydrogen 
atoms of the copolymers. The typical signals of the MPEG 
blocks are seen at d =3.35 (Ha, methoxy protons) and 3.65 
ppm (Hbþc, methylene protons). The resonance peaks of 
PaClCL blocks are shown at δ = 1.46–1.65 (Hf,C4 
methylene protons), 1.71 (Hg,C5 methylene protons), 
1.91–2.09 (He,C3  
In vitro degradation of about 50 mg of copolymer thin 
pellets was performed in 5 mL of PBS  
(0.067 M, pH 7.4) at 37 。C, and the buffer solution was 
changed every 2 days. At time intervals, the specimen was 
removed, washed with

methylene protons), and 4.13–4.31 ppm (Hdþh, C2 methine 
and C6 methylene protons).  
Substitution of the Pendent Cl Atoms of 
MPEG-b-Pα ClCL by Sodium Azide  
According to Scheme 1, the pendent chlorides of 
MPEG-b-P α ClCL must be converted into azides by 
reaction with sodium azide. MPEG-b-PaClCL was thus 
reacted with 1 equiv of sodium azide in DMF at room 
temperature overnight. The results of the substitution are 
compiled in Table 1. The IR spectrum expectedly shows a 
new absorption at 2106 cm1 characteristic of the azide [Fig. 
2(B)]. 1H NMR confirms that the conversion of the pendent 
chlorides into azides is almost quantitative. Indeed, the 
resonance peak at 4.25 ppm for the CHCl protons 
disappears completely in favor of a new peak at 3.85 ppm, 
typical of the CHN3 protons [Fig. 1(B), peak d]. The molar 
ratio [α N3CL]/[MPEG] in the block copolymers was 
analyzed by 1H NMR and was calculated by integrating the 
resonance peaks at δ = 3.85 ppm of the CHN3 protons of 
PaN3CL with the resonance peaks δ = 3.35 ppm of the 
terminal methoxy protons of MPEG. Table 1 shows that the 
molecular weight of the copolymers is slightly increased as 
a result of the chloride substitution by azide. This 
observation is consistent with a small change in the hydro-
dynamic volume of the copolymer. Importantly, the elution 
peak remains symmetrical and a slight increase in the 
polydispersity is reported, which strongly suggests lack of 
chain degradation [Fig. 3]. Typical 1H NMR spectrum of 
the block copolymer MPEG45-b-Pα N3CL37 is shown in 
Figure 1(B). The resonance peaks are assigned to the 
corresponding hydrogen atoms of the copolymers.  
Thermal Properties of MPEG-b-PaClCL 
and MPEG-b-PaN3CL Block Copolymers 
The thermal behaviors of the block copolymers are shown 
in Table 1. According to DSC, copolymerization of MPEG 
with increasing amounts ofα ClCL (orα N3CL) has a 
strong effect on the thermal transitions. MPEG shows 
indeed a melting temperature (Tm) at 20, 52, and 64。C as 
the Mn of MPEG between 550, 2000, and 5000 g mol1, 
respectively. Whereas the chlorinated polyester (PaClCL) 
and PaN3CL are amorphous with a Tg at 44 and 43。C, 
respectively. Noticeably, PEG blocks can crystallize in 
MPEG-b-Pα ClCL and  
MPEG-b-Pα N3CL as the Mn of MPEG above 2000 g mol1. 
Fixing the length of the MPEG block and increasing the 
length of Pα ClCL (or Pα N3CL) block, an increase 
tendency in Tgs was observed. Tgs of MPEG-b-Pα ClCL 
and MPEG-bPα N3CL are higher than MPEG-b-PCL (Tg S

6。C).21 This is due to the steric hindrance and static effect of 
aClCL containing the chloro-substituents (or α N3CL 
containing the azo-substituents) that reduces the flexibility 
of backbone. When larger amounts of α ClCL (or α
N3CL) were incorporated into the macromolecular 
backbone there was an increase in Tg. The copolymers of 
MPEG12-b-PaClCL and MPEG12-b-PaN3CL exhibited 
only Tg as the Mn of MPEG = 550 mol1. Therefore, these 
copolymers were amorphous. However, when the Mn of
MPEG above 2000 g mol1, the copolymers of MPEG-b-Pα
ClCL and MPEG-b-Pα N3CL were semicrystalline, and 
exhibited a Tm which is lower than the corresponding 
MPEG, given a decreased Tm when the length of Pα ClCL 
or Pα N3CL increased.  
Click Reaction of MPEG-b-PaN3CL with Alkyne  
To functionalize the aliphatic polyesters, chemical 
transformation by click reaction between alkynes and 
azides is very appealing because of a mild condition and 
quantitativeness. Various kinds of alkynes, for example, 
1-hexyne, propargyl benzoate (PBA), and 4-propargloxy 
proline (POPr), can be attached onto azide containing 
aliphatic polyesters by click reaction. Modified the reported 
by Je´ro me,17 the click reaction was

mers in an aqueous phase were determined by a 
fluorescence technique using pyrene as a probe.  
Excitation spectra of pyrene in the MPEG113b-(P α
N3CL20-g-Hexyne17) solution with various concentrations 
are shown in Figure 4. As it can be seen, the fluorescence 
intensity increases with the increase in the concentration of 
MPEG113-b-(Pα N3CL20-g-Hexyne17). The characteristic 
feature of pyrene excitation spectra, a red shift of the (0,0) 
band from 334 to 338 nm upon pyrene partition into 
micellar hydrophobic core, was utilized to determine the 
CMC values of MPEG-b-(Pα N3CL-g-alkyne) block–graft 
copolymers. Figure 5 shows the intensity ratios (I338/I334) of 
pyrene excitation spectra versus the logarithm of 
MPEG-b-(Pα N3CL-g-alkyne) block– graft copolymers’
concentration. The CMC was determined from the 
intersection of straight line segments, draw through the 
points at the lowest

line, with that going through the points on the rapidly rising 
part of the plot. The CMC values of the block–graft 
copolymers depending on the block composition are shown 
in Table 3. The block–graft copolymers have lower CMC 
values than the corresponding block copolymers. At the 
fixed length of hydrophilic block, the length or steric 
hindrance of hydrophobic segment increased and the CMC 
values decreased. The lower CMC values for MPEG-b-
(PaN3CL-g-alkyne) clearly show that grafted of 
hydrophobic group to the PCL makes self-association

result in MPEG45-b-(PaN3CL9-g-Hexyne5) was observed. 
This is due to the micelles of less stable 
MPEG45-b-(PaN3CL9-g-Hexyne5). Furthermore, by
comparing the size of loaded and unloaded AM drug 
micelles, the size increased when AM was loaded in 
MPEG-b-(PaN3CL-galkyne) micelle (Fig. 7). But, no 
significant difference in the micelle size was observed 
when AM was loaded in MPEG-b-PaN3CL micelle.  
Preliminary In Vitro Degradation Study  
As a model of biodegradation, the in vitro degradation of 
block–graft MPEG-b-(PaN3CL-g-alkyne) was evaluated 
from the changes in the molecular weight. The results are 
depicted in Figure 8. After the immersion for 30 days, the 
molecular weight losses of the copolymers were 84% for 
MPEG113-b-(PaN3CL20-g-Hexyne17) and 74% for 
MPEG45-b-(PaN3CL40-g-Hexyne33). Increasing the 
length of hydrophilic segment in the copolymers increased 
their hydrophilicity and thus resulted in larger molecular 
weight losses.  
CONCLUSIONS  
Amphiphilic MPEG-b-(PaN3CL-g-alkyne) block– graft 
copolymers were successfully synthesized from aClCL and 
MPEG as the macroinitiator via the ROP, substitution, and 
click reaction. The molecular weight and unit compositions 
of the block–graft copolymers were controlled by  
the molar ratios of aClCL to the macroinitiator and the 
grafting efficiency. CMC values were detected by 
fluorescence probe technique. An increase of the length and 
steric hindrance of hydrophobic segment in amphiphilic 
block–graft copolymers produced a lower CMC values. 
The drug entrapment efficiency and the drug loading 
content increased when the feed weight ratio of AM to the 
polymer increased. The morphology of the micelles 
exhibited a spindle or spherical shape depending on the 
length of hydrophilic block. DLS experiments showed that 
the mean hydrodynamic diameters of the micelles were in 
the range of 90–160 nm. These copolymers degraded under 
physiological conditions. The drug release measurements 
are under way in our laboratory.
