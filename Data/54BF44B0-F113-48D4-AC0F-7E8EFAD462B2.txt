41 Introduction
Zinc oxide has drawn great attention recently for possible applications on ultraviolet/blue
semiconductor lasers and light emitting devices [1, 2]. However, the large lattice mismatch
between ZnO and sapphire causes high density of threading dislocations in the epitaxial layer
which deteriorates its electronic and optical properties [3-5]. Various substrates, such as GaN
[6], LiTaO3 [7, 8], -LiAlO2 [9, 10], and ScAlMgO4 [11, 12], having lower lattice mismatches
have been employed for heteroepitaxial growth of ZnO. Among them,-LiAlO2 (100) substrate
not only possesses a low lattice mismatch but also offers a possibility of growing ZnO in its
[1010] nonpolar direction [10, 13].
In our previous report, a nonploar (1010) ZnO epitaxial layer has been successfully grown on
-LiAlO2 (100) substrate at high growth temperatures of 650~700oC [10]. However, ZnO
grown on the same substrate in other orientations, such as (0001), has also been reported by
using a PLD technique [9]. Detailed microstructural characterization of the ZnO epilayer
grown onLiAlO2 substrate has not been reported yet. In the present study, a systematic study
was carried out to clarify the effect of growth temperature on growth behaviour and
microstructure of ZnO epitaxial layers on LiAlO2 (100) substrates. Results indicated that the
azimuthal orientation of the epitaxial layer can thus be manipulated by controlling the growth
temperature.
2 Experimental
A single crystal–LiAlO2 of 2 inches in diameter was grown along its [100] direction using
Czochralski pulling technique[14, 15]. After the crystal being cut and polished,–LiAlO2 (100)
wafers with RMS roughness of 2nm were obtained and were used as substrates throughout the
experiments. The LiAlO2 substrate was cleaned by acetone and methanol in sequence and was
positioned at the center of the horizontal CVD furnace. Prior to the CVD process, the chamber
was pumped to a pressure of 8×10-3 torr or lower, and was then refilled with nitrogen and oxygen
to maintain a constant pressure of 200 torr. The flow rates of nitrogen and oxygen were 500
sccm. The zinc source, zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (Zn(C5H7O2)2‧H2O, Lancaster), was
positioned outside the furnace heating zone and was heated by heating tape to 120oC. Its vapor
was then carried by the N2/O2 gas mixture into the CVD furnace. Three growth temperatures
(Tg) were employed at 575oC, 640oC and 675oC, and the deposition time ranged from 300
seconds to 10800 seconds.
Following the CVD growth, the surface morphology of the substrate and the films were
imaged by contact-mode atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope
(JEOL 6330), respectively. The crystal orientation and the crystallinity of the epitaxial films
were characterized by using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and x-ray diffraction
techniques. Detailed microstructural characterization of the films was also carried out using
cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 3010 & FEI Tecnai G2).

Figure 3 X-ray rocking curves for films deposited at 675oC for 3000s, 7200s and 10800s.
Further microstructural characterization was conducted by using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional bright-field image of the film deposited
for 10800s. The image is taken near [2243] zone axis with g = 1010. Diffraction analysis
revealed that the film grown on LAO substrate possesses the same epitaxial relationship as that
reported previously [10] as (1010)m-ZnO //(100)LAO, [0001]m-ZnO//[010]LAO and [1120]m-ZnO//
[001]LAO, where m represents the (1010) oriented ZnO. The ZnO column is about 200nm wide
and is comparable to the brick width shown in Fig. 2. High density of threading dislocations in
an order of 1010 cm-2 is observed in the crystallites. Strain contrast can also be observed in the
LAO substrate near the interface, indicating a portion of misfit/thermal strain is accommodated
by the substrate lattice. Unlike the (1010) oriented GaN deposited on LAO, stacking faults are
seldom observed in the (1010) oriented ZnO [18-21]. The stacking faults are a growth-related
defect and are attributed to the surface morphology of the substrate [18, 20]. In the present case,

Figure 7(a) shows a cross-sectional bright-field image for the film deposited at 575oC for
7200s. The total thickness of the film is about 800nm which is about twice as much as that of
the film deposited at 675oC (see Fig. 4). It is interested to note that two kinds of crystallites are
observed. A layer of coalescent, dome-shaped crystallites can be observed right on the
substrate. These crystallites are of about 200~400nm in height. In addition, columnar or
trapezoid-shaped crystallites of 600~800 nm in height are also observed. Electron diffraction
patterns taken from the substrate, the dome-shaped crystallites and the trapezoid-shaped
crystallites are shown in Fig. 7(b)-(d), respectively. It is evident that the dome-shaped
crystallites have their (1010) plane parallel to the substrate surface, whereas the (0001) plane of
the trapezoid-shaped crystals is parallel to the substrate surface. In other words, the former is
the (1010) oriented ZnO which is overshadowed by the (0001) oriented hexagons. Fig. 7(e) is a
dark field image taken from the g=0112m-ZnO spot. Distorted Moire fringes, roughly parallel to
the interface, can be observed in all the dome-shaped crystallites (see inset in Fig. 7(e)) from top
down to the interface with a spacing of 3.4nm, which coincides well with the calculated value of
3.47nm for parallel (10.0)ZnO and (00.2)ZnO. The appearance of Moire fringes gives evidence

identified above. The lattice mismatches of the prismatic (1010) ZnO are relatively small and
are of 0.7% for (0001)ZnO/(010)LAO and of 3.6% for (1120)ZnO/(004)LAO. The lattice match
between the hexagonal (0001) ZnO and the LAO is less perfect with a mismatch value of 8.2%
for (1010)ZnO/(020)LAO. In addition, the interfacial bonding is also preferred to the prismatic
ZnO. As a consequence, it is no surprise that the (1010) oriented ZnO formed nuclei on LAO
no matter which deposition temperatures was employed. However, the kinetics may prefer the
nucleation of the (0001) oriented ZnO at a low growth temperature [22].
Figure 8 Ball-and-stick model of-LiAlO2 in [100] projection.
Fig. 9 shows cross section TEM bright field (BF) images the film deposited at 575oC for
7200s. The crystal labeled C corresponds to which have an {0001} azimuthal orientation, and
that labeled M has a {1010} azimuthal orientation. The orientation relationship of the {1010}
oriented ZnO and LAO substrate is determined as: [0001]ZnO//[010]LAO and [1120]ZnO//[001]LAO,
which is the same as that reported in ref. 10. It is interested to note that both kinds of crystals
were nucleated directly on the LAO substrate. However, the {0001} oriented crystals grew in a
rate which is about twice as high as that of the {1010} oriented ones in the direction
perpendicular to the substrate surface. Moreover, the {0001} oriented crystals can grow
laterally over the {1010} oriented ones. The lateral growth of the {1010} oriented ZnO
resulted in a shape of an up-side-down hexagonal pyramid having its narrow but flat tip attached
to the substrate. The angle between the pyramid surfaces and the top surface is ranging from
47o~60o. Finally, the BF image also shows the density and distribution of dislocations in the
ZnO film. A high density of misfit dislocations can be observed at the interface of the {0001}
oriented ZnO and LAO. The density of threading dislocations in region right above the
C-ZnO/LAO interface is also high. However, the overgrowth region contains almost no
threading dislocations. On the other hand, the threading dislocations is distributed relative
homogeneously in the {1010} oriented ZnO.

[00.-1] direction, and the top surface is an oxygen terminated (0001) surface. Based on the
assumption that the (000 1) possesses the lowest surface energy among the surfaces, a nucleation
mode of the (0001) oriented ZnO on the LAO substrate is proposed as follows. In the very
beginning of the deposition, (1010) oriented islands nucleate first on the substrate. After the
nuclei are saturated and start to coalesce, the newly arrived adatoms can start to form 2D (0001)
layer on the uncovered substrate if the free energy change of forming a 2D layer is close to that
of island growth. The difference of the free energy change (G) can be expressed as:
G =GC -GM
whereGC is the free energy change for 2D layer formation andGM is that for 3D island
growth. TheGC andGM is thus calculated assuming a constant nuclear density estimated
from AFM image of about 1x1015 m-2, and a semispherical shape of the 3D islands as
GC =VGv-s +AC (Ce+i-s) +VUC
GM =VGv-s +AM (Me+i-s) +VUM
respectively, whereGv-s is the volume free energy change,e,i,s are the surface energy of
ZnO, the interfacial energy and the surface energy of LiAlO2, respectively, andU is the strain
energy. AM represents the surface area increment of the (1010) island andAC the area of
uncovered substrate. The superscripts C and M represent the (0001) and (1010) oriented ZnO,
respectively. Assuming that the interfacial energy is small and can be neglected, the
difference of the free energy change,G, is thus derived and is shown in Fig. 10. The surface
energies of (1010)ZnO and (0001)ZnO reported by Fujimura et al. [23] are employed. The surface
energy of LiAlO2 (100) is however not available in literatures and is assumed as 0.2, and 0.3
mJ/cm2, respectively. The strain energies of the (1010) and (0001) oriented ZnO are estimated
using the elastic constants reported by Azuhata et al.[30] with a form factor of 0.5 [31]. It is
evident that the free energy difference between nucleating a 2D (0001) layer and continuously
growing 3D (1010) islands decreases with increasing film thickness or the island size. As a
result, it is possible to form (0001) oriented ZnO layers on the LAO substrate instead of
continuing island coalescence. The low surface energy of (0001)ZnO prefers a lateral extension
in directions perpendicular to [0001]ZnO and the overgrown nuclei finally impinge to each other.

4 Conclusions
The present work demonstrates that epitaxial layers having either a [1010] or an [0001]
azimuthal orientation was obtained on LiAlO2 (100) substrates. At a high growth temperature
of 675oC, only the (1010) oriented ZnO crystallites nucleated on LAO in a 3D mode with a slow
growth rate. On the other hand, both the (1010) and (0001) oriented ZnO were formed at low
growth temperatures. We have demonstrated a possibility to obtain high quality (0001) ZnO
epitaxial film via a self-masked lateral overgrowth mechanism. According to the mechanism,
the (1010) oriented ZnO nucleated predominantly on the LiAlO2 substrate followed by
nucleation of the (0001) oriented ZnO on still uncovered substrate. The (0001) oriented ZnO
possessed a high growth rate in both the normal direction and the in-plane directions, and
resulted in a continuous epitaxial film. The later one possessed a high growth rate and
overshadowed the (1010) oriented crystallites. High density of threading dislocations in an
order of 1010cm-2 were observed in the (1010) oriented epilayer. The (0001) oriented epilayer,
however, had a lower dislocation density when its thickness was increased. In proper control
of the nucleation of the (10.0) mask ZnO, the quality of the (00.1) epitaxial layer can be further
improved.

1 Introduction Zinc oxide has drawn great attention recently for possible applications on ultraviolet/blue
semiconductor lasers and light emitting devices [1, 2]. However, the large lattice mismatch between ZnO and sapphire
causes high density of threading dislocations in the epitaxial layer which deteriorates its electronic and optical
properties [3-5]. Various substrates, such as GaN [6], LiTaO3 [7, 8],-LiAlO2 [9, 10], and ScAlMgO4 [11, 12], having
lower lattice mismatches have been employed for heteroepitaxial growth of ZnO. Among them, -LiAlO2 (100)
substrate not only possesses a low lattice mismatch but also offers a possibility of growing ZnO in its [1010] nonpolar
direction [10, 13].
In our previous report, a nonploar (1010) ZnO epitaxial layer has been successfully grown on -LiAlO2 (100)
substrate at high growth temperatures of 650~700oC [10]. However, ZnO grown on the same substrate in other
orientations, such as (0001), has also been reported by using a PLD technique [9]. Detailed microstructural
characterization of the ZnO epilayer grown onLiAlO2 substrate has not been reported yet. In the present study, a
systematic study was carried out to clarify the effect of growth temperature on growth behaviour and microstructure of
ZnO epitaxial layers on LiAlO2 (100) substrates. Results indicated that the azimuthal orientation of the epitaxial
layer can thus be manipulated by controlling the growth temperature.
2 Experimental A single crystal–LiAlO2 of 2 inches in diameter was grown along its [100] direction using
Czochralski pulling technique[14, 15]. After the crystal being cut and polished,–LiAlO2 (100) wafers with RMS
roughness of 2nm were obtained and were used as substrates throughout the experiments. The LiAlO2 substrate was
cleaned by acetone and methanol in sequence and was positioned at the center of the horizontal CVD furnace. Prior to
the CVD process, the chamber was pumped to a pressure of 8×10-3 torr or lower, and was then refilled with nitrogen
and oxygen to maintain a constant pressure of 200 torr. The flow rates of nitrogen and oxygen were 500 sccm. The
zinc source, zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (Zn(C5H7O2)2‧H2O, Lancaster), was positioned outside the furnace heating
zone and was heated by heating tape to 120oC. Its vapor was then carried by the N2/O2 gas mixture into the CVD
furnace. Three growth temperatures (Tg) were employed at 575
oC, 640oC and 675oC, and the deposition time ranged
from 300 seconds to 10800 seconds.
Following the CVD growth, the surface morphology of the substrate and the films were imaged by contact-mode
atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (JEOL 6330), respectively. The crystal orientation
and the crystallinity of the epitaxial films were characterized by using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD)
and x-ray diffraction techniques. Detailed microstructural characterization of the films was also carried out using
cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 3010 & FEI Tecnai G2).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Tg=675
oC The nucleation of ZnO on LAO at 675oC was rather slow. Consequently, the deposits after being
grown for 300s and 1000s could neither be detected by x-ray diffraction nor be identified without ambiguity in AFM
images, partly due to the relatively rough nature of the substrate surface. However, the ZnO film probably nucleated
in a 3D Volmer-Weber (VW) mode since X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (not shown) indicated that both
Al 2p and Zn 2p photoelectrons were detected for sample deposited for 300s and 1000s. When the film was grown
for 3000s, the AFM image shown in Fig. 1 clearly reveals the morphology of the ZnO nuclei. At that stage, the film
is composed of partly coalescent islands. The islands have sizes ranging from 80nm to 200nm and their height is
about 25~40nm. The nuclear density is estimated to be 40m-2, and the film indeed grows in a VW mode. It was
reported that GaN grew on LAO in a 3D islands mode with well-defined crystallographic facets ({1010} and {1011})
[16]. The ZnO islands in the present case, however, do not have a well-defined shape in the initial stage of
deposition. When the

3.2 Tg=575
oC In contrast to the case of 675oC deposition, nucleation rate of ZnO at 575oC is relatively high.
Figure 5 is an AFM image of the film deposited for 1000s. It is evident that ZnO still nucleates as 3D islands on LAO.
The substrate surface is in fact completely covered by islands having an average size of about 40nm and a height of
3~7nm. The nuclear density of about 300m-2 is therefore significantly higher than that of the film deposited at
675oC. It is worth noting that a few nuclei having a bigger size of 80~120nm can also be observed. Fig. 6 shows
SEI and corresponding EBSD pattern of ZnO epilayer grown on LAO substrate for 7200s. Well aligned hexagons of
about 700nm in size appear on the surface indicating that the film has its (0001) surface parallel to (100)LAO. The
corresponding EBSD pattern verifies that the hexagons have an [0001] azimuthal orientation and the edges of the
hexagons are parallel to <1120>ZnO. The result indicates that the azimuthal orientation of ZnO changed from [1010] at
675oC to [0001] at 575oC. In fact, for ZnO deposited at 640oC, the film surface is covered by elongated bricks
associated with scattered hexagons, revealing that the orientation transition occurs gradually from 575oC to about
650oC. A well defined orientation relationship between the (1010) oriented (m) and the (0001) oriented (c) ZnO was
also determined according to the EBSD patterns (not shown) as [0001]m-ZnO//[1010]c-ZnO and [1120]m-ZnO//[1120]c-ZnO. In
other words, it is a 90-degree rotation with respect to one of the <1120> axes.

and resulted in an (0001) oriented epilayer. Moreover, the distortion of the Moire fringes is a
result of high density of dislocations existing in region close to the interface. The dislocation
density, nevertheless, decreases dramatically in the (0001) oriented crystallites with the increasing
of their thickness. The (0001) oriented epilayer therefore possesses an epitaxial relationship as:
(0001)c-ZnO //(100)LAO, [10.0]c-ZnO//[010]LAO and [11.0]c-ZnO//[001]LAO.
Figure 8 shows the atomic arrangement of the (100)LAO surface. Two nucleation sites for hexagonal (0001) ZnO
and prismatic (1010) ZnO can be identified as represented by the black solid line and the gray solid line, respectively,
according to the orientation relationships identified above. The lattice mismatches of the prismatic (1010) ZnO are
relatively small and are of 0.7% for (0001)ZnO/(010)LAO and of 3.6% for (1120)ZnO/(004)LAO. The lattice match
between the hexagonal (0001) ZnO and the LAO is less perfect with a mismatch value of 8.2% for (1010)ZnO/(020)LAO.
In addition, the interfacial bonding is also preferred to the prismatic ZnO. As a consequence, it is no surprise that the
(1010) oriented ZnO formed nuclei on LAO no matter which deposition temperatures was employed. However, the
kinetics may prefer the nucleation of the (0001) oriented ZnO at a low growth temperature [22].

4 Conclusion The present work demonstrates that epitaxial layers having either a [1010] or an
[0001] azimuthal orientation was obtained on LiAlO2 (100) substrates. At a high growth
temperature of 675oC, only the (1010) oriented ZnO crystallites nucleated on LAO in a 3D mode
with a slow growth rate. On the other hand, both the (1010) and (0001) oriented ZnO were
