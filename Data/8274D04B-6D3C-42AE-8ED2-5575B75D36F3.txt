where dT  is a normalization constant, d is a real constant and 
1−z  represents a unit 
of time delay. Physically, dT  is the sampling time interval in the DSP study. If d is 
set equal to 1, the transformation in (1) is called a bilinear transformation, which is 
widely used in converting analog prototypes to discrete-time prototypes. When the 
frequency response of the differentiator is concerned, the parameter z in (1) is 
replaced with the following relation 
 
)2(,ωjez =  
 
where ω  is the frequency angle and πω ≤≤0 . The value of d strongly affects the 
linearity of the transformation in (1). On the other hand, the multiplication constant 
2/Td dictates the amplitude response of (1). It is required that the amplitude response 
of (1) should be less than unity for the normalized frequencies. Fig.1 shows the 
relative errors of the amplitude responses of (1) as a function ω  for d=0 to 1, with 
0.2 increments. The relative error of the amplitude response of the ideal differentiator 
is also shown in Fig. 1. If d is 0.2, the relative error is less than 1 % for the range 
0-0.5π of normalized frequency and 2 % for the range 0-0.8π of normalized frequency. 
Therefore, the value of d of the transformation in (1) is proper to be selected as the 
system function of a wide-band differentiator. Fig. 2 shows the amplitude responses of 
(1) for different values of d when they are compared to an ideal differentiator. The 
ideal differentiator is assumed to have precisely linear amplitude response for all 
frequencies, as shown in Fig. 2. When d is equal to 1, the amplitude response of the 
system function in (1) becomes infinite at Ω=π. In comparison, if d=0.166, the 
relative error is less than 1 % (or –40 dB) when πω 8.00 ≤≤ . The value of 
2/Td=0.417 is selected to assume that the maximum value of s in (1) is unity for the 
normalized frequencies when d=0.166. Under such the examination, the 
transformation in (1) has a good linearity in amplitude response when d is set equal to 
0.166. For d=0.166, we therefore adopt (1) as the system function of the differentiator 
in discrete-time infinite impulse response format and the selected system function of 
the first-order differentiator is

Fig. 8 shows the magnitude response of the new integrator in (5). The magnitude 
responses of an ideal, Simpson and Trapezoidal integrators are also shown in Fig. 8. 
Both Simpson and Trapezoidal integrator are inversely proportional to the normalized 
frequency and deviate from the value of an ideal integrator in the upper frequency 
band. The new integrator is approximately the ideal integrator in the normalized 
frequency band of πω ≤≤0 . Fig. 9 shows the relative error of the magnitude 
response of the new integrator has an error of less than 1.1 % for the range 0-0.8π of 
normalized frequency and 6.5 % for the range 0.8π-π of normalized frequency. Fig. 10 
shows the phase response of the new integrator which is approximately the linear 
phase. In addition, the maximum error of the new integrator is 9.5° occurring at 0.55 
of the normalized frequency. With the simple formulations, the new integrator gives 
higher accuracy and greater range of frequencies than traditional integrators. 
 
4. Conclusion 
  The bilinear transformation is employed to propose both the new differentiator 
and integrator. First-order differentiator and integrator as an example are presented. 
Both the first-order differentiator and integrator have an almost linear phase. The 
simple and accurate formulations are suitable for real-time applications. The new 
differentiator and integrator allow them to be eligible for wide-band applications 
which approximates the ideal differentiator and integrator.
