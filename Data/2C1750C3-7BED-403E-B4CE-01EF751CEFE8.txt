Abstract
In this project we have conducted
investigation and modeling of sub-32nm
multiple-gate SOI CMOS. We have proposed
an analytical model considering quantum
confinement effects in short-channel gate-all-
around MOSFETs under subthreshold region.
In addition, we have conducted a comparative
study of carrier transport characteristics for
multi-gate FinFET MOSFETs with and
without the nonoverlapped source/drain
structure. Our study will be instrumental for
ultra-scaled multi-gate device/circuit designs.

二、計畫目的及研究方法
As the semiconductor industry is
confronted with the difficulty of downsizing
the transistor dimension, multiple-gate SOI is
emerging as an important device structure for
CMOS scaling [1]. In this project, we have
conducted investigation and modeling for sub-
32nm multi-gate SOI CMOS. This report
describes our two main tasks regarding multi-
gate research during this project:
Task I: Analytical Quantum Confinement
Model for Short-Channel Gate-All-Around
MOSFETs Under Subthreshold Region [9]
Task II: A Comparative Study of Carrier
Transport for Overlapped and Nonoverlapped
Multiple-Gate SOI MOSFETs [23]
Task I
Gate-All-Around (GAA) MOSFET is an
ideal structure to provide superior electrostatic
behavior and is recognized as an important
candidate for ultimate CMOS scaling [2]-[4].
As the channel thickness of GAA MOSFETs
scales down, the quantum confinement effects
become significant. This two-dimensional
confinement effect is often considered to be
independent of the carrier flow direction (i.e.,
channel length direction). Thus, the quantum
3well approximation [4], [5]. For short-channel
lightly-doped GAA devices, however, the
conduction band edge EC is lowered by
source/drain coupling and is bended from a
flat well to a parabolic-like well (Fig. 4). Since
the EC is not spatially constant for short-
channel devices, we choose the EC at the
channel center (r = 0) as the reference energy.
Fig. 4 shows that the Ej’s can be correctly
predicted by our analytical solution
considering the short-channel potential barrier.
Fig. 5(a) shows that the lowest eigen-energy
(E1) increases as channel length decreases.
This eigen-energy shift results from the
bending of EC due to the short channel effect.
Fig. 5(b) shows that the square of lowest
eigen-function (|Ψ1|2) for short-channel lightly-
doped device is more centralized to the
channel center. This is because the EC barrier
at the channel center (r = 0) is lower than that
near the insulator/channel interface (r = D/2),
and the electron density becomes larger at r =
0. Fig. 6 shows that the E1 increases with VDS.
In other words, the drain-induced-barrier-
lowering (DIBL) increases the EC bending and
affects the quantum confinement effects.
Our analytical model can also be used to
assess the impact of quantum confinement on
heavily-doped GAA MOSFETs. Similar to the
lightly-doped short-channel devices, the EC of
heavily-doped devices can be described by the
parabolic form. In contrary to the upward
bending of EC in the lightly-doped case, the EC
bends downward for heavily-doped devices.
Fig. 7 shows that the EC for long-channel
heavily-doped GAA device shapes the
potential well near the interface (r = D/2).
Therefore, we choose the EC at r = D/2 as the
reference energy for long-channel GAA
devices. Fig. 8(a) shows that the E1 of long-
channel GAA devices increases with channel
doping. This is because as the channel doping
increases, the surface electric field increases
and hence the bending of EC at the interface is
increased. As a result, the E1 increases due to
the stronger electrical confinement. Besides, it
can be seen that for heavily-doped channel
(e.g., 5×1018cm-3), the E1 increases with
increasing channel diameter, which is contrary
to the lightly-doped case (e.g., 1×1015cm-3).
This is because for heavily-doped devices, the
electrical confinement becomes stronger with
increasing channel diameter, as shown in Fig.
8(b).
Fig. 9 compares the electron density
distribution calculated from the classical
model [8] and the quantum confinement model.
It can be seen from Fig. 9(a) that for lightly-
doped short-channel GAA MOSFET, the
electron density near the interface (r = D/2)
predicted by the quantum confinement model
is smaller than classical model. Fig. 9(b)
shows that for heavily-doped long-channel
GAA MOSFET, the peak electron density
predicted by the quantum confinement model
is away from the interface, while the classical
model predicts the highest electron density at
the interface. Fig. 10 compares the average
electron density at y = 0.5Leff calculated from
the classical model and the quantum
confinement one for lightly-doped short-
channel devices. It can be seen that the
discrepancy becomes larger with reducing
channel diameter.
In conclusion, we have proposed an
analytical model for quantum confinement
effects in GAA MOSFETs under the
subthreshold region. The Schrödinger equation
is solved considering the bended potential well
of parabolic form. Our analytical model
accurately predicts the impact of short-channel
effects on the eigen-energy and eigen-function
of GAA devices. This short-channel quantum-
confinement model is crucial to the ultra-
scaled GAA MOSFETs design.
5Fig. 16 shows the electronic potential
calculated using ISE device simulation [17]
for our nonoverlapped device. The
nonoverlapped gate to source/drain regions act
as the voltage-controlled potential barriers
along the channel. Therefore, carrier transport
from source to drain is significantly influenced
by the barriers as illustrated in Fig. 16: directly
tunneling (Ia), thermally associated tunneling
(Ib), and thermionic emission (Ic). The
contribution of these three mechanisms to IDS
depends on VGS and temperature. For high VGS,
Ia is dominant. With decreasing VGS, increased
electronic potential diminishes Ia and thus Ib
and Ic become important. In other words, IDS in
the subthreshold region results mainly from Ib
and Ic for the nonoverlapped device. It is worth
noting that carrier transport by Ic requires more
thermal energy and may be suppressed under
low temperature. Fig. 17 shows the
temperature sensitivity of IDS(Δlog(IDS)/ΔT)
versus VGS characteristics extracted from Figs.
12 and 13 under high and low temperatures.
For the nonoverlapped device in the strong
inversion region, the insensitive temperature
dependence manifests the importance of Ia. On
the other hand, the negative temperature
dependence for the overlapped device in the
strong inversion region indicates phonon
scattering. In addition, it can be noted in Fig.
17(a) that Δlog(IDS)/ΔT significantly increases
with decreasing VGS for both overlapped and
nonoverlapped devices. This suggests that in
the high temperature regime the subthreshold
current of the nonoverlapped device is
dominated by Ic, similar to the overlapped
device. When temperature decreases, however,
the thermionic emission Ic is suppressed and
the Ib component with weak temperature
dependence becomes dominant. In other words,
the suppression of Ic under low temperature is
the main reason of S saturation for the
nonoverlapped device. It should be noted that
such mechanism of S saturation is different
from lateral tunneling through the channel, as
presented for ultrashort devices in [14] and
[18].
Fig. 16 also shows an equivalent quantum
well under the gate in the nonoverlapped
device [14]. It is worth noting that the height
of the voltage-controlled potential barriers in
the nonoverlapped regions increases with VGS.
The consequence is the plausibility of
electron-wave confined between the barriers.
When the length of the quantum well, d, is
smaller than the inelastic-scattering (e.g.,
phonon scattering) length, the phase-coherent
electron wavefunction over the entire channel
as well as quantum interference between
coherent electronwaves occur. The quantum
interference enhances the electron
backscattering probability [19], [20] and
thereby reduces the conductivity expected
classically. Such quantum correction to the
conductivity is the weak localization effect
[19], [20] and logarithmically dependent on
temperature as Δσ = (pe2/πh) ln(T), where the
value of p depends on the scattering process.
When T = 56 K, the carriers at VDS = 50 mV
experience more heating (more phonon
scattering) and thus less localization effect
than those at VDS = 1 or 2 mV. Therefore, the
GDS measured at VDS = 50 mV is larger than
that at VDS = 1 or 2 mV (Fig. 15). From the
GDS data at VDS = 2 mV under T = 56 K and
223 K in Fig. 15, we can estimate that p ≈ 1,
which is close to the results in [21] for the 2-D
electron gas in Si MOSFETs.
The quantum-mechanical interference for
an electron wave passing through a quantum
well also results in oscillating transmission
probability. Fig. 18 shows the calculated Tr for
the quantum well in Fig. 16. The values of d
and (E−eVp ) used in Fig. 18 are based on our
experiments. It is worth noting that the Tr
oscillation becomes obvious with increasing
VGS as well as the depth of the quantum well.
From the Tr calculation based on d = 30 nm
and (E −eVp) = 0 −5 meV (Fig. 18), we can
observe three transmission maxima due to
constructive interference (i.e., Tr = 1) at VGS≈

VLSI Symposium has long been recognized as one of the most important conferences in
the VLSI field. This year, a total of 205 papers from 15 countries were submitted, and 82
papers were accepted by the conference. Our paper“Impact of Uniaxial Strain on Channel
Backscattering Characteristics and Drain Current Variation for Nanoscale PMOSFETs”was
presented at the Session 6A - Variability on June 16. The chairpersons were Dr. Masahara from
AIST, Japan and Prof. T.-J. King from UC Berkeley. In this work, we used a novel generalized
temperature-dependent method to examine the impact of uniaxial strain on backscattering
characteristics in nanoscale PFETs. We showed that the backscattering coefficient can be
reduced by the uniaxially-compressive strain. We further demonstrated that the strain
technology can improve the drain current variation as well as the mismatching properties
through the enhanced ballistic efficiency. Overall our presentation went pretty well.
Regarding the Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop, it is one of the major international

Abstract—Using an improved temperature-dependent method, 
this paper clarifies that channel backscattering of nanoscale 
PMOSFETs can be reduced by the uniaxially compressive 
strain. For the first time, the electrostatic potential of the 
source-channel junction barrier has been experimentally 
characterized with strain and gate voltage dependence. We 
further demonstrate that the strain technology can improve the 
drain current variation as well as the mismatching properties 
through the enhanced ballistic efficiency. Moreover, the 
improvement shows gate length and drain voltage dependence. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Channel strain engineering has been actively pursued to 
enable the mobility scaling of CMOS devices. As the gate 
length (Lg) scales into the nanoscale regime in which the carrier 
ballistic transport prevails [1-2], strain-induced enhancement 
becomes more complicated [3-4]. Characterizing nanoscale 
strained MOSFETs from the perspective of channel 
backscattering (rsat) becomes crucial to strain engineering [4-6]. 
However, it has been reported that uniaxially compressive 
strain tends to increase the rsat of PMOSFETs [5-6]. The reason 
is not clear and needs to be clarified. In addition, the impact of 
uniaxial strain on the drain current variation has rarely been 
known and merits investigation. 
In this work, we examine the impact of uniaxial strain on 
backscattering characteristics in nanoscale PFETs and 
demonstrate that rsat can be reduced by the uniaxially 
compressive strain. Besides, impacts of strain on the 
electrostatic potential of the source-channel junction barrier 
(Fig. 1) and the non-threshold-voltage drain current variation 
(Fig. 2) are experimentally investigated for the first time.  
II. CHANNEL BACKSCATTERING CHARACTERISTICS 
The strained devices were fabricated by state-of-the-art 
process-induced uniaxial strained-silicon technology featuring 
SiGe source/drain and compressive contact etch stop layer 
(CESL) (Fig. 1) [5-8]. Fig. 3 shows that the saturated drain 
current (Id,sat) and the linear drain current (Id,lin) of the strained 
device are improved by 2.1X and 2.9X as compared with its 
unstrained counterpart, respectively.  
According to the channel backscattering theory [2-3], rsat 
depends on the mean-free path Ȝ and the critical length l as rsat 
= 1/(1+Ȝ/l) [3]. To obtain rsat, we extracted Ȝ/l using the 
self-consistent method [9], in which Ȝ/l and (ȕȝ-ȕl) can be 
self-consistently determined by (1) & (2):

where ȕȝ, ȕl and Ȗ are defined as the temperature sensitivity of 
the low-field mobility ȝ0, the critical length l and the thermal 
velocity ȣtherm, respectively [10,11]. Contrary to the pervious 
studies in [5,6,10,11], this self-consistent method [9] does not 
assume constant ȕȝ and ȕl in the determination of Ȝ/l and rsat 
(e.g., ȕȝ = -1.5 and ȕl = 1 in (1)). Fig. 4 shows significant 
discrepancy in the extracted Ȝ/l between the self-consistent 
(ȕȝ-ȕl) and (ȕȝ-ȕl) = -2.5. Note that the temperature dependence 
of Ȝ/l can satisfy the constraint of Eq. (2) for the self-consistent 
(ȕȝ-ȕl), but not for (ȕȝ-ȕl) = -2.5. Fig. 5 shows that the 
self-consistently extracted (ȕȝ-ȕl) and rsat are strongly 
dependent on Vgs. Note that the self-consistently extracted 
(ȕȝ-ȕl) (Fig. 5(a)) presents more phonon-limited behavior (i.e., 
more temperature- sensitive) for the strained device, similar to 
the measured Id,sat in Fig. 3(a). However, the assumption of 
(ȕȝ-ȕl) = -2.5 results in insensitive rsat–Vgs dependence and 
completely opposite strain effects on rsat.  
The reduced rsat in the compressive-strained PFET (rsat for 
self-consistent (ȕȝ-ȕl) in Fig. 5(b)) can be referred to the 
enhanced Ȝ (Fig. 6(b)), which can be extracted from [3]

Besides, we have confirmed that the enhancement of effective 
mobility ȝ and ȣtherm (Figs. 6(c) and 6(a)) follows the relation of 
Ȝ v (2kBTȝ0/qȣtherm) [10], i.e., 1.9X (Ȝ enhancement) ~ 3.3X (ȝ 
enhancement) / 1.5X (ȣtherm enhancement). The strain effect on 
the enhancement of 1/m* and the relaxation time Ĳ can also be 
obtained: ~2.3X from (ȣtherm enhancement)2 and ~1.3X from (Ȝ 
enhancement)/(ȣtherm enhancement), respectively. In addition, 
we further extracted the critical length l by rsat = 1/(1+Ȝ/l). Fig. 
7(a) shows the potential -kBT/q vs. (lT-l233K) characteristics, 
which can be viewed as the potential gradient of the 
source-channel junction barrier (Fig. 1). It is clear that more 
backscattering events for the unstrained device with smaller Ȝ 
raise the electrostatic potential to higher energy to maintain the 
same carrier density, as predicted in [12]. Moreover, the Vgs 
dependence of the potential gradient in Fig. 7(b) explains the 
Vgs dependence of rsat for the self-consistent (ȕȝ-ȕl) in Fig. 5(b).  
III. DRAIN CURRENT VARIATION & BALLISTIC EFFICIENCY 
A simple expression relating Id of nanoscale MOSFETs to P0 has been derived by Lundstrom [3] as    BII dd  100 PGPG  (4),
in which the sensitivity of Id to P0 is determined by the ballistic 
efficiency B. Eq. (4) reveals that the impact of the P0 variation, 
ı(P0)/P0, on the Id,sat variation, ı(Id,sat)/Id,sat, can be suppressed 
when the ballistic efficiency B is enhanced. To ensure that the 
VT variation does not affect the following analysis, we have 
confirmed in Fig. 8 that the standard deviation of VT, ı(VT), as 
well as the VT variation, ı(VT)/VT, are similar between strained 
and unstrained devices. The linear dependence of ı(Id,sat)/Id,sat 
on ı(P0)/P0 presented in Fig. 9 follows the prediction of Eq. (4), 
in which the slope represents the degree of ballistic efficiency 
B. The reduced slope for strained PFETs (Fig. 9) can be 
explained by the Bsat enhancement (Bsat,strained-Bsat,unstrained) (Fig. 
10). It is worth noting that the suppression of ı(Id,sat)/Id,sat, the 
Bsat enhancement and the P enhancement are more significant 
with decreasing Lg. Besides, we found that the B enhancement 
decreases with decreasing Vds (Fig. 11), which may be referred 
to the relation of B ~ Ȝ/(L+Ȝ) for low Vds, i.e., the Ȝ 
enhancement is not important for Ȝ/(L+Ȝ) as L >> Ȝ. Such Vds 
dependence of the B enhancement results in the weak 
suppression in the ı(Id)/Id vs. ı(P0)/P0 characteristics measured 
at Vds = 0.3 V (Fig. 12).  
Statistics on the mismatch in drain current (ǻId) and 
threshold voltage (ǻVT) were analyzed for identical devices in a 
matching pair configuration on 60 dies (Fig. 13). Fig. 14 shows 
that the drain current mismatch in the high gate bias regime is 
dominated by the non-VT mismatch. Moreover, improved 
matching performance for strained PFETs can be observed in 
Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. It is worth noting that the reduction of 
ı(ǻId/Id) for strained PFETs (Fig. 15) is more significant for 
|Vds| = 1 V than for |Vds| = 0.05 V. This result can be understood 
from the Vds dependence of the B enhancement (Fig. 11).  
IV. CONCLUSION 
Using an improved temperature-dependent method, we 
have shown that the rsat of nanoscale PMOSFETs can be 
reduced by the uniaxially compressive strain. For the first time, 
the electrostatic potential of the source-channel junction barrier 
has been experimentally characterized with strain and Vgs 
dependence. We further demonstrate that the strain technology

Introduction 
With MOSFET scaling, the impact of random dopant 
fluctuation (RDF) and line edge roughness (LER) on the 
threshold voltage (Vth) variation for MOSFETs is growing and 
being extensively examined [1-4]. For logic circuits, the 
variation of signal switching time due to RDF and LER is 
especially important. Whether there is any gap between Vth and 
switching time variations merits investigation. In this work, we 
investigate the switching time variation for FinFET and bulk 
MOSFETs using the approach of effective drive current in 
CMOS inverters [5]. 
Methodology 
We decouple the switching time (ST) variation into 
transition charge (∆Q) variation and effective drive current (Ieff) 
variation. The ST can be defined as ∆Q / Ieff [6], where ∆Q is the 
transition charge between logic “ON” and “OFF” states. The ∆Q 
for an NFET can be calculated by Qn (VGS = VDD, VDS = 0.05 V) － Qn (VGS = 0V, VDS = VDD). The Ieff for an NFET can be 
approximated as [IDS (VGS = VDD, VDS = 0.5VDD) + IDS (VGS = 
0.5VDD, VDS = VDD)] / 2 [5]. Therefore, in contrast to the 
time-consuming mixed-mode transient simulation, only DC 
simulation for a single device is needed to derive ∆Q and Ieff. 
More importantly, the effective current approach may provide 
physical insights in the assessment of the switching time 
variations. 
To assess the RDF in bulk MOSFETs, we have carried out 
the atomistic device simulation using the Monte Carlo approach 
[2]. To avoid the charge trapping in the sharp Coulomb potential 
well and hence the mesh size dependences of the simulation 
results, we have employed the density gradient method in our 
atomistic simulation [7]. Fig. 1(a) shows a sample used in our 
RDF atomistic simulation for bulk devices. To assess the LER, 
the line edge patterns were derived using the Fourier synthesis 
approach [3], and then the Monte Carlo simulation was 
performed. Fig. 1(b) shows a sample used in the LER 
simulations for bulk devices. The multi-gate structure we study 
in this work is the lightly doped FinFET with aspect ratio = 2 
[Fig. 2(a)]. The gate-LER and fin-LER are considered as 
independent variation sources for FinFET [4]. Fig. 2(b) and (c) 
show samples used in our Monte Carlo simulations for gate- and 
fin-LER for FinFET, respectively. 
Results and Discussion 
Bulk MOSFET 
Fig. 3(a) compares the impacts of RDF and LER on the 
saturation threshold voltage (Vth,sat) variations of bulk 
MOSFETs. It can be seen that the standard deviation of Vth,sat 
(σVth,sat) due to RDF is larger than that due to LER. 
Nevertheless, Fig. 3(b) shows that the standard deviation of ST 
(σST) due to LER is larger than that due to RDF. Since ST = ∆Q 
/ Ieff, the normalized standard deviation of ST (σST / µST) can 
be approximated as |σST / µST| ≈ |σ∆Q / µ∆Q - σIeff / µIeff|, 
where µST, µ∆Q and µIeff are the mean values of ST, ∆Q and Ieff, 
respectively. Fig. 4 shows the |σST / µST|, |σ∆Q / µ∆Q|, and 
|σIeff / µIeff| (normalized standard deviation of ST, ∆Q and Ieff, 
respectively) caused by RDF and LER. It can be seen that the 
|σST / µST| due to RDF is roughly equal to the difference of 
|σIeff / µIeff| and |σ∆Q / µ∆Q| due to RDF. However, the |σST / 
µST| due to LER is roughly equal to the sum of |σIeff / µIeff| and 
|σ∆Q / µ∆Q| due to LER. The results in Fig. 4 can be explained 
as follows. The impact of RDF on MOSFETs stems from the 
variation of the effective channel doping (Nch,eff). For devices 
with smaller Nch,eff, the Vth is smaller and hence both Ieff and ∆Q 
are larger because they are roughly proportional to (VGS - Vth). 
Thus, Ieff and ∆Q are positively correlated [Fig. 5(a)]. Therefore, 
|σST / µST| is roughly equal to the difference of |σ∆Q / µ∆Q| 
and |σIeff / µIeff| because the quantities of σ∆Q and σIeff have the 
same sign. In other words, the impacts of RDF on ∆Q and Ieff 
are mutually canceled and |σST / µST| is reduced. 
The impact of LER on bulk MOSFETs results from the 
variation of the effective channel length (Leff). For devices with 
shorter Leff, the Vth is smaller because of the short channel effect 
and hence the Ieff is larger. As for ∆Q, devices with shorter Leff 
possess smaller ∆Q because ∆Q is proportional to the gate area 
(W × Leff). Thus, Ieff and ∆Q are negatively correlated [Fig. 
5(b)]. Therefore, |σST / µST| is roughly equal to the sum of 
|σ∆Q / µ∆Q| and |σIeff / µIeff| because the quantities of σ∆Q and 
σIeff have the opposite sign. In other words, the |σST / µST| is 
larger than either |σ∆Q / µ∆Q| or |σIeff / µIeff|. Fig. 6 indicates 
that the relative importance of LER for switching time variation 
is larger as compared with that for Vth variation. 
FinFET 
Fig. 7(a) compares the impacts of gate-LER and fin-LER 
on Vth,sat variations of FinFET. It can be seen that σVth,sat due to 
fin-LER is larger than that due to gate-LER. Nevertheless, Fig. 
7(b) shows that σST due to gate-LER is larger than that due to 
fin-LER. Fig. 8 shows the |σST / µST|, |σ∆Q / µ∆Q|, and |σIeff / 
µIeff| caused by gate-LER and fin-LER. The |σST / µST| due to 
gate-LER is roughly equal to the sum of |σIeff / µIeff| and |σ∆Q / 
µ∆Q|. This is because Ieff and ∆Q due to gate-LER are 
negatively correlated [Fig. 9(a)]. However, the |σST / µST| due 
to fin-LER is roughly equal to the difference of |σIeff / µIeff| and 
|σ∆Q / µ∆Q|. The impact of fin-LER on FinFET stems from the 
variation of the effective fin width (Wfin). For lightly devices 
with smaller Wfin, the Vth is larger because of the suppression of 
short channel effect [1] and hence the Ieff is smaller. As for ∆Q, 
devices with smaller Wfin possess smaller ∆Q because ∆Q is 
proportional to the gate area. Thus, the Ieff and ∆Q are positively 
correlated [Fig. 9(b)]. The impacts of fin-LER on ∆Q and Ieff are 
mutually canceled and |σST / µST| is reduced. Fig. 10 indicates 
that the relative importance of gate-LER for switching time 
variation is larger as compared with that for Vth variation. 
Conclusions 
We have investigated the impact of LER and RDF on 
switching time variations of bulk MOSFETs and FinFET using 
the effective drive current approach. The ST variation can be 
decoupled into ∆Q variation and Ieff variation. Our results 
indicate that for bulk MOSFETs, the ST variation caused by 
LER may be larger than that caused by RDF. Although RDF has 
been recognized as the main variation source to Vth variation, 
LER becomes more crucial to the ST variation of bulk 
MOSFETs. As for FinFET, although the impact of fin-LER is 
more crucial to Vth variation, the relative importance of 
gate-LER increases as the ST variation is considered. Our study 
may provide insights for device and circuit designs using 
advanced CMOS technologies.

with Symmetric/Asymmetric Halo Implant

Introduction 
With the scaling of device dimensions, the device 
mismatching that stems from stochastic fluctuations is becoming a 
concern for nanoscale MOSFETs [1-3]. Especially, the high 
concentration halo/pocket implant raises a great concern to the 
threshold voltage mismatch caused by random dopant fluctuation 
(RDF) [4-7]. In addition, the asymmetric halo implant structure 
(with source-side only) has been proposed to suppress the 
drain-induced threshold shift (DITS) [8]. Nevertheless, the impact 
of asymmetric halo implant on device mismatching properties has 
rarely been examined and merits investigation. In this work, we 
investigate the mismatching properties of symmetric and 
asymmetric devices using experimental measurement and 
atomistic device simulation. 
Measurement and Simulation 
The mismatching properties were measured from identical 
devices in a matching pair configuration on 60 dies and 40 dies 
for bulk and partially depleted (PD) SOI devices, respectively. 
The threshold voltage (Vth) was determined by the 
constant-current method, and current factor (β) was determined by 
the maximum slope method. 
To access the impact of symmetric/asymmetric halo implant 
on the RDF in MOSFETs, we have carried out the atomistic 
device simulation (from 150 samples) using the Monte Carlo 
approach [6]. To avoid the charge trapping in the sharp Coulomb 
potential well and hence the mesh size dependence of the 
simulation results, we have employed the density gradient method 
in our atomistic simulation [7]. 
Results and Discussion 
A. Impact of Symmetric Halo Implant on Vth Mismatch 
Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the Pelgrom plot of measured Vth 
mismatch (σ∆Vth) for bulk PFETs and NFETs, respectively. The 
gate width W= 1µm and gate length Lgate ranges from 54nm to 
1µm. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the measured σ∆Vth saturates 
to a finite value as Lgate increases, instead of linearly decrease with 
(WLgate)-1/2. The deviation of the measured σ∆Vth from the linear 
relationship between σ∆Vth and (WLgate)-1/2 expected from the 
RDF theory [9] implies a fluctuation source that remains as Lgate 
increases. This phenomenon can also be observed for the PD SOI 
devices shown in Fig. 2.  
The anomalous Vth fluctuation present in Figs. 1 and 2 can 
be reproduced by the device simulation (Fig. 3). From the surface 
potential profile in Fig. 4, it can be seen that potential barriers 
exist in the halo regions. The potential barrier plays an important 
role in determining the device Vth and thus the Vth fluctuation [4, 
10]. In other words, the Vth fluctuation of the halo-implanted 
device is mainly determined by the RDF in the halo-implanted 
region and is less sensitive to Lgate as Lgate increases. 
 
B. Comparison of Vth Mismatch for Asymmetric and 
Symmetric Devices 
While the symmetric device suffers from the DITS [8], the 
asymmetric halo implanted structure (with source-side implant 
only) has been proposed and shown higher immunity to DITS 
(Fig.5). Nevertheless, Fig. 6 indicates that the σ∆Vth of the 
asymmetric device is larger than that of the symmetric device. The 
device simulation results in Fig. 7 also show larger Vth fluctuation 
for the asymmetric one. The larger Vth fluctuation present in the 
asymmetric device can be attributed to the smaller potential 
barrier region as compared with the symmetric counterpart, as 
demonstrated in Fig. 8. 
 
C. Comparison of β Mismatch for Asymmetric and 
Symmetric Devices 
Fig. 9 shows the measured Pelgrom plot of σ(∆β)/β for 
symmetric and asymmetric devices. It can be seen that the σ(∆β)/β 
of the asymmetric device is larger than that of the symmetric one. 
Fig. 10 further indicates that the larger σ(∆β)/β results from the 
larger σ(∆β) present in the asymmetric device. To further 
understand the enhanced σ(∆β) in the asymmetric device, we have 
performed low frequency noise measurements. This is because 
carrier mobility fluctuations show their presence in the low 
frequency noise characteristics. Through a careful extraction, we 
found that the Hooge parameter [11], which represents the degree 
of mobility fluctuations, is larger for the asymmetric device as 
compared with the symmetric one (Fig. 11). It is plausible that the 
larger σ(∆β) results from the larger mobility fluctuation present in 
the asymmetric device. 
Conclusions 
We have investigated the mismatching properties in 
nanoscale MOSFETs with symmetric/asymmetric halo implant. 
We show that the Vth mismatch is mainly determined by the RDF 
in the halo-implanted region, and the Vth mismatch for the 
asymmetric device is larger than that of the symmetric one. 
Besides, the asymmetric device shows larger σ(∆β)/β which 
results from larger σ(∆β). It is plausible that the larger σ(∆β) 
results from larger mobility fluctuation present in the asymmetric 
device.
