 Flow characteristics and heat transfer in side-opened, end-sealed duct flows without and 
with a 45o delta-wing turbulator were experimentally investigated. Three-component mean and 
fluctuating velocity measurements were conducted at duct cross-sections and near duct wall by a 
laser Doppler velocimetry to characterize flow structures and to obtain near-wall flow parameters, 
including the convective mean velocity, second-flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. A 
heated copper plate, installed on the duct bottom wall, was used as a heat transfer surface. 
Temperatures on the heat transfer surface were measured using thermocouples to obtain the local 
and averaged Nusselt numbers. The investigated Reynolds numbers were between 1546 and 
15151. Results of this study show that the flow reversal, recirculation, reattachment and 
redevelopment occur in the investigated duct flows. Also, the flows exhibit free and retarded 
stagnation point flow behaviors. The turbulator causes large regions of small convective mean 
velocity, and, in general, increases the flow secondary-flow and turbulence effects. Results also 
show that the turbulator augments the heat transfer rate, which is mainly caused by the increases 
of the flow secondary-flow and, especially, the turbulence effects. The heat transfer augmentation 
increases with Reynolds number. The local heat transfer distributions for Reynolds numbers of 
1546 and 15151 are dominated by the flow convective mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy, 
respectively.

mean velocity ( v ) is the average value of the 8192 velocity samples and the fluctuating velocity is 
obtained from 22 v8192/v −∑ , where v is the local instant velocity. A smoke generator was used to 
generate smoke particles, which were sucked into the test duct by the blower, for the LDV measurements. 
These measurements were conducted at duct X-Y and X-Z planes to characterize the flow structures, and 2 
mm from the heat transfer surface to obtain near-wall flow parameters, including the convective mean 
velocity, secondary-flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. The uncertainty in the measured velocity 
ranges was less than 5 percent from the repeatability tests conducted during the test runs.

, was measured on the 9 x 12 cm2 heat transfer surface, 
which consists of a 0.025 mm copper plate, a heating plate, and a balsa-wood insulation plate, see Fig. 2. 
Electrical power, Qin, ranged from 6.3 to 40.6 watts with 3 percent uncertainty, was supplied to the heating 
plate from a DC power supply, resulting in a constant-heat-flux heat-transfer surface. The reference 
temperature, T0, is the air inlet temperature, obtained using a Type-T, 0.1 mm-diameter thermocouple 
placed at the contraction section of the wind tunnel system. The surface temperature, Tw, distributions on 
the heat transfer surface were obtained using 99 thermocouples, where the junction beads of 
thermocouples were spot welded on the back of the copper plate. The surface temperatures were ranged 
from 56 oC to 94 oC under the investigated conditions with the uncertainty of 1oC from repeatability tests. 
Heat conduction loss through the back of the heating plate is calculated using the Fourier’s law, which is 
estimated to be less than 3 percent of the total heat generated. Radiation loss is estimated to be less than 
3.6 percent of the total heat flux. Conduction loss along the sides of the heat transfer plate accounted for a 
small fraction and was neglected. The uncertainty in heat transfer measurement was estimated to be within 
6 percent [12]. 
3. Results and Discussion 
 The cross-sectional flow structures in X-Z and X-Y planes for the flows without and with turbulator 
were discussed. Figure 3 presents a typical mean flow velocity vectors in the central (Y/H=0.5) X-Z plane 
for Re=15151 (Ud=5 m/s) without turbulator. In this central plane, the flow is subjected to no 
boundary-layer effect. Due to the side-opened, end-sealed duct geometry, the flow exhibits a free 
stagnation point flow behavior, where a positive pressure gradient exists in the direction of flow. The flow 
is forced to decelerate axially (X-direction) and accelerate transversely (Z-direction) outward as the flow 
approaches the end wall. A stagnation point essentially exists at X/L=1, Z/W=0. Similar flow structures 
were observed for other investigated Reynolds numbers. Figures 4(a-b) present the flow structures at 
Z/W=0.583 in X-Y plane without turbulator for Re=1546 (Ud=0.51 m/s) and 15151. In this cross-section, 
the flow is flowing in a duct where the end, top and bottom walls are sealed. Due to the end-sealed wall 
effect, the axial velocities decrease as the flow approaches the end wall. When the fluids impinge on the 
end wall, they are forced to flow upward and downward, and impinge on the top and bottom walls. Then, 
the fluids flow back to the main stream, causing the flow reversal and recirculation. Figure 4(a) shows that 
the flow is disturbed near the end wall and extended to the origin of test duct (X/L=0) for Re=1546. 
Reversed flow occurs approximately from X/L=0.38 to the end wall, and a small recirculation region 
occurs near the end wall. Figure 4(b) shows that the disturbed flow region for Re=15151 is smaller than 
that for Re=1546, due to the larger axial momentum and thinner boundary layer at the bottom wall. 
Reversed flow occurs approximately from X/L=0.78 to the end wall, and a recirculation region still occurs 
near the end wall. The flow structures at other Z/W positions are qualitatively similar to those shown in 
Figs. 4(a-b). The 45o delta-wing turbulator effect on the flow structures in X-Y plane is presented in Figs. 
5(a-d). It is noted that the turbulator, with vertical tip height of 0.7 cm (Y/H=0.233), is placed on the 
bottom wall upstream of the test duct (X/L=-0.3055). Apparently, the flows are largely disturbed by the 
turbulator, and much large reversed flow regions were observed. At Z/W=0, the fluid-blockage effect is 
the largest among other Z/W’s. Figures 5(a) and 5(c) show that the investigated flows behave like flows 
over a backward-facing step, where the flow recirculation, reattachment and redevelopment occur. Flow 
recirculation regions occur downstream of the turbulator for both the investigated flows of Re=1546 and 
15151. Larger recirculation regions occur for Re=1546 than Re=15151. As the flow impinges on the 
bottom wall, it redevelops and a second recirculation region occurs due to the end-sealed wall effect. The 
flow structures at Z/W=0.583 are qualitatively similar to those at Z/W=0. Since the fluid-blockage effect 
by the turbulator at Z/W=0.583 is not as large as that at Z/W=0, Figs. 5(b) and 5(d) show that the 
recirculation regions are smaller than those shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(c). 
The velocity fields in the boundary layers have major effects on the heat transfer process. Three 
near-wall flow parameters, including the convective mean velocity, secondary-flow velocity (i.e., the mean 
velocity normal to the heat transfer surface) and turbulent kinetic energy, were used to evaluate the 
relations between the local fluid flow and heat transfer [7]. Boundary-layer thickness measurements 
and near X/L=0 for Re=15151. These figures also show that the maximum Nu occurs near the end wall, 
duct side openings. The Nu distributions on the measured heat transfer surface are not largely varied, 
which is up to 50% for the investigated Reynolds numbers. The 45o delta-wing turbulator effects on local 
Nu distributions are presented in Figs. 9(d-f), showing apparently different distributions from those 
without turbulator. The variation in local Nu is reduced, which is around 34.8% for Re=1546, 24% for 
Re=6121 and 12.6% for Re=15151. In addition, it is show in Fig. 9(d) that the location of minimum Nu 
moves further upstream to the origin of test duct for Re=1546. At, and large downstream regions from, the 
origin of test duct, the values of Nu are small. The Nu gradually increases as the fluids flow toward the 
end wall and duct side openings. On the contrary, Figs. 9(e-f) show that the values of Nu are large near the 
origin of test duct, slightly decrease and, then, increase with X/L. These local heat transfer characteristics 
are apparently related to the flow fields near the heat transfer surface, as discussed below. 
In order to evaluate the turbulator effect on the overall heat transfer rate, the averaged Nusselt 
number, Nu , on the heat transfer surface was computed by integrating the local Nusselt number, 
1/),( AdxdzzxNu∫∫ , where A1≅A. Since the insertion of turbulator into the flow causes an additional 
pressure loss compared with the flow without turbulator, these investigations were performed under a 
constant pumping power condition for a better comparison. In these measurements, the power input to the 
blower of the wind tunnel system for the flow with turbulator is equal to that for the flow without 
turbulator. The averaged Nusselt numbers for the general flows (i.e., the duct sides are sealed, and the duct 
end is open) of the investigated Reynolds numbers were also measured and compared. Figure 10 presents 
variations of Nu  with Reynolds number for the general flows and present investigated flows without and 
with the 45o delta-wing turbulator. The heat transfer rates in side-opened, end-sealed duct flows are 
apparently larger than those in general flows. This result is expected since the heat transfer is mainly by 
the convective effect in general flows, while it is by the flow secondary-flow and turbulence effects 
associated with the flow convective effect in a side-opened, end-sealed duct flow. Figure 10 also shows 
that the 45o delta-wing turbulator augments the heat transfer rate for all of the investigated Reynolds 
numbers. The augmentation increases with Reynolds number, which is approximately 3.3% for Re=1546, 
and up to 35.3% for Re=15151. In view of the near-wall data shown in Figs. 6-8 and the results discussed 
above, the heat transfer augmentation is caused by the increases of the flow secondary-flow and, especially, 
the turbulence effects. Since the increase in flow turbulent kinetic energy is much larger for Re=15151 
than that for Re=1546, the heat transfer augmentation by the turbulator is, accordingly, much larger for 
Re=15151 than Re=1546. 
Comparing Figs. 6(a) and 9(a), Figs. 6(c) and 9(d), respectively, show a good similarity between the 
convective mean velocity and local Nusselt number distributions for Re=1546. Figure 6(a) shows that a 
minimum convective mean velocity occurs around X/L=0.4, Z/W=0. The convective mean velocities are 
getting large from this location and, are large at duct side openings. Figure 9(a) shows that the Nusselt 
number has a minimum value near X/L=0.4, Z/W=0, and increases from this location toward upstream, 
downstream and duct side openings. Also, Figure 6(c) shows that the turbulator causes negative and small 
connective velocities at, and large downstream regions from, the origin of test duct, where the values of 
Nusselt number are small, as presented in Fig. 9(d). These results suggest that the flow convective effect 
plays an important role in local heat transfer distribution for Re=1546. However, the convective mean 
velocity distributions are apparently different from the local Nusselt number distributions for Re=15151. 
Figure 6(b) shows that a minimum convective mean velocity occurs around X/L=0.8, Z/W=0. The 
convective mean velocities are getting large from this location and, are large at duct side openings. Figure 
9(c) shows that the values of Nusselt number are small near the origin of test duct, and increase as the 
fluids flow downstream. Also, Fig. 6(d) shows that the convective mean velocities for the flow with 
turbulator are small at, and large downstream regions from, the origin of test duct. Figure 9(f) shows that 
the values of Nusselt number are large near the origin of test duct, decrease and, then, increase with X/L. 
These results suggest that the flow convective effect should not have a main effect on local Nusselt 
number distribution for Re=15151. It is also noted from Figs. 7(b) and 7(d) that the secondary flow 
velocities are largely varied near the end wall. Figures 9(c) and 9(f) show that the Nusselt number 
gradually varies near the end wall, suggesting that the flow secondary-flow effect should not play an 
important role in local Nusselt number distribution. Figures 8(b) and 9(c), respectively, show that the 
turbulent kinetic energy and Nusselt number increase as the fluids flow downstream. Figure 8(d) shows 
that the turbulator causes the increase of turbulent kinetic energy, which, in general, is large at the exit of 
test duct, slightly decrease and, then, increase with X/L up to X/L=0.78. This figure also shows that the 
variation in turbulent kinetic energy on the heat transfer surface is small. The Nusselt number distribution 
shown in Fig. 9(f) is generally similar to the turbulent kinetic energy distribution in most regions of the 
heat transfer surface. These results suggest that the flow turbulence effect has a profound effect on local 
Nusselt number distribution for Re=15151.
