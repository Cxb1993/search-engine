for short). Two spanning trees in a graph G are
said to be independent if they are rooted at the
same node r and such that, for each node v 6= r
in G, the two different paths from v to r, one
path in each tree, are internally node-disjoint. A
set of spanning trees of G is independent if they
are pairwise independent.
Zehavi and Itai [35] conjectured that for any
node r in a k-connected graph G, there exist k
ISTs of G rooted at r. Therefore, all subsequent
researches devoted to the construction of a set
of ISTs with any node r as the common root
and such that the cardinality of the set of ISTs
matches the connectivity of G. Although the
problem is hard for general graphs, the conjec-
ture has been confirmed for k-connected graphs
with k 6 4 (see [15] for k = 2, [4, 35] for k = 3,
and [5] for k = 4). Also, several results are
known for some special classes of graphs. Es-
pecially, the graph classes related to interconnec-
tion networks, such as product graphs [24], pla-
nar graphs [14], chordal rings [16, 30], de Bruijn
and Kautz digraphs [10, 11], hypercubes [26, 33],
star graphs [25], recursive circulant graphs [31,
32], multidimensional torus [27], odd graphs [18],
hyper-stars and folded hyper-stars [29]. There is
a surprise to us that till now no further results
related to ISTs have been acquired for other vari-
ations of hypercubes except for locally twisted
cubes [21,22] and folded hypercube [28]. Yang et
al. [28] showed that indeed all spanning trees of
a folded hypercube constructed in [12] are inde-
pendent. In this project, we revisit the problem
of constructing ISTs on folded hypercubes. For
FQn, we propose an algorithm of constructing
n + 1 ISTs each with height dn2 e + 1 (i.e., the
diameter of FQn plus one). This is an improve-
ment over the result of [12, 28] and the ISTs we
constructed are optimal in the sense that heights
are minimized.
The rest of this project is organized as follows.
Section 2 formally gives the definition of folded
hypercubes and presents our construction scheme
of ISTs. Section 3 shows the correctness of the
proposed algorithm. The final section contains
our concluding remarks.
2 Constructing spanning trees in
folded hypercubes
An n-dimensional hypercube, denoted by Qn,
is a graph consisting of 2n nodes represented by
binary strings of length n from 0 to 2n − 1. Two
nodes in Qn are adjacent if and only if their corre-
sponding binary strings differ in exactly one bit.
An n-dimensional folded hypercube, denoted by
FQn, is basically a Qn enhanced with extra links
between any two nodes whose binary strings are
complements of each other. Figure 1 shows the
graph FQ4, where dotted lines represent com-
plement links. El-Amawy and Latifi [6] showed
that FQn is (n+1)-regular (n+1)-connected and
has diameter dn2 e. Ma and Xu [23] proved that
FQn is node-symmetric and edge-symmetric. For
more results related to folded hypercubes, the
reader can refer to [2, 7, 12,19,28,36,37].

Let V (G) and E(G) be the node set and edge
set, respectively, of a graph G. Two paths P
and Q joining the same nodes x and y are said
to be internally disjoint, denoted by P ||Q, if
V (P ) ∩ V (Q) = {x, y} and E(P ) ∩ E(Q) = ∅.
A spanning tree T in a graph G is a connected
subgraph containing all nodes of G and without
forming a cycle. For x, y ∈ V (T ), the unique
path from x to y is denoted by T [x, y]. Moreover,
if T is a spanning tree with r as its root and a
node x 6= r, then the parent of x is denoted by
parent(T, x). Thus, two spanning trees T and
T ′ with the same root r are ISTs (respectively,
edge-disjoint) if and only if T [x, r] ||T ′[x, r] (re-

3 Correctness
In what follows, we prove the validity of the
trees by the reachability to the root through trac-
ing the parent function. The paths constructed
in the following lemma would facilitate our proof
of the independency.
Lemma 1. For each i ∈ I∪{∗}, Ti is a spanning
tree rooted at 0 in FQn.
Proof. According to Procedure Gen-Parents,
it is obvious that every node x( 6= 0) ∈ FQn im-
plies x ∈ Ti. To complete the proof, we need
to show that there exists a unique path from
every node x(6= 0) to 0 in Ti. Suppose that
H1x = {k ∈ I : xk = 1} = {ks−1, ks−2, . . . , k0}
with ks−1 > ks−2 > · · · > k0 and H0x = {` ∈ I :
x` = 0} = {`t−1, `t−2, . . . , `0} with `t−1 > `t−2 >
· · · > `0, where all index arithmetics of kp are
taken modulo s and all index arithmetics of `q
are taken modulo t. We recall that j = nextx(i)
and consider the following cases:
Case 1: i 6= ∗, xi = 1, and |H1x| = s 6 n/2 + 1.
In this case, we assume that i = kp for some
According to Lemma 1, we can determine the
length of the unique path Ti[x, 0] for each node
x(6= 0) ∈ FQn in every spanning tree Ti. Ta-
ble 2 shows the length of Ti[x, 0]. Therefore, we
compute the height of each spanning tree in the
following lemma.
Lemma 2. For each i ∈ I ∪{∗}, the height of Ti
is dn/2e+ 1.
Lemma 3. For i, j ∈ I ∪ {∗} with i 6= j, Ti and
Tj are ISTs rooted at 0 in FQn for n > 3.
According to our algorithm, every vertex can
determine its parent for a specific independent
spanning tree only depending on its own label.
Although Lemma 3 merely shows the indepen-
dency of ISTs in FQn for n > 3, the three ISTs
of FQ2 are easy to be constructed. Thus, from
Lemmas 1, 2 and 3, we have the following theo-
rem.
Theorem 4. For n > 2, the algorithm using
Procedure Gen-Parents can correctly construct
n+1 ISTs each with height dn/2e+1 for FQn in
O((n + 1)2n) time. In particular, the algorithm
can be parallelized on FQn by using 2
n processors
to run in O(n) time.
4 Concluding remarks
To develop a basis of communication with full
bandwidth in FQn, Ho [12] constructed a set
of n + 1 edge-disjoint spanning trees each with
height twice the diameter of FQn. Yang et
al. [32] recently proved that the trees constructed
in [12] are indeed independent. Evidently, the
proof of independency is more difficult than that
of showing edge-disjoint. In this project, we
provide another construction scheme to produce
n+ 1 ISTs of FQn, where the height of each tree
is equal to the diameter of FQn plus one, and
thus significantly improves the height of previ-
ous one. Because the common root (i.e., node
0) in each IST has a unique child (i.e., node 2i
for some i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}) which has dis-
tance dn/2e to an antipodal node in FQn, this
shows that the heights of ISTs in FQn are re-
quired at least dn/2e+ 1. Since our construction
of ISTs for FQn has attained to the lower bound,
we conclude that the heights of ISTs constructed
in this project are optimal. Recently, a major
challenge on the issue of constructing ISTs for
interconnection networks tends toward pursuing
the goal of reducing the heights of ISTs (e.g.,
see [11, 26, 30, 33]). However, research results of
obtaining optimal heights of ISTs are limited. To
the best of our knowledge, no further literature
exists except the result for hypercubes in [26,33]
and the present report for folded hypercubes.
