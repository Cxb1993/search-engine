Results indicate that Cu2+ can be effectively adsorbed by both non-crosslinked and 
crosslinked CCB beads. Non-crosslinked CCB beads showed higher adsorption capacity 
than crosslinked CCB beads in the entire pH range studied. However, the chitosan in 
non-crosslinked CCB beads was dissolved at pH 1. Epichlorohydrin was employed as 
the crosslinking agent to obtain beads that are insoluble in acidic solution. The initial 
Cu2+ solution concentration and the solution pH both significantly affect the adsorption 
capacity. An increase in initial Cu2+ concentration results in increase of adsorption 
capacity, which also increases with increasing pH. Experimental data correlated well 
with Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities 
obtained from the Langmuir model for non-crosslinked and crosslinked CCB beads are 
12.21, 10.50, 9.64 and 1.03 mg Cu2+/g CCB beads and 9.43, 9.26, 8.42 and 2.61 mg 
Cu2+/g CCB beads for pH 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The experimental data fitted very 
well to the pseudo-second order kinetic model, which indicates that the chemical 
sorption is the rate-limiting step, instead of mass transfer. The Cu2+ ions can be 
desorbed from the crosslinked CCB beads by strong HCl acid (pH 1), which indicates 
that crosslinked CCB beads can be regenerated and reused to adsorb metal ions.

1. Introduction 
 
Effluents containing significant amount of toxic and polluting heavy metals are 
continuously discharged into the environment. Heavy metals such as Hg, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, 
Cd and Zn are usually associated with tendency to accumulate in living organisms and 
highly toxic when adsorbed into the body [1]. Potential sources of copper in industrial 
effluents include metal cleaning and plating baths, pulp, paper and paper board mills, 
wood pulp production, electrical industries, fungicides and fouling paints. When copper 
is ingested at high concentrations, it can become toxic to humans, causing cancer and 
promoting oxidation. It is also toxic to aquatic organisms even at very small 
concentrations in natural water [2,3]. 
 
Problems associated with heavy metal pollution could be reduced or minimized by 
conventional methods such as chemical precipitation, filtration, electrochemical 
treatment, and ion exchange. But these processes have the disadvantages of high-cost, 
generation of secondary pollutants, poor removal efficiency and ineffectiveness for low 
metal concentration [4]. Adsorption is now recognized as an effective and economic 
method with high potential for the removal, recovery and recycling of metals from 
wastewater. Considerable attention has been directed towards low cost biosorbents, or 
sorbents of biological origin, due to the high cost of activated carbon, the most widely 
used adsorbent [5]. 
 
An inexpensive alternative adsorbent could drastically reduce the cost of an 
adsorption system. According to Bailey et. al., a sorbent can be assumed “low cost” if it 
requires little processing, is abundant in nature, or is a by-product or waste material 
from another industry [6].  
 
Chitin, poly(β(1→4)-N-acetyl—glucosamine), is found in the exoskeleton of 
 4
Clay minerals are also important inorganic components in soil. Their sorption 
capabilities come from their high surface area and cation exchange capacities. The 
negative charge on the structure of clay minerals gives clay the capability to attract 
metal ions [9]. 
 
The aim of this study is to compare the adsorption of copper ions from acidic 
aqueous solutions using non-crosslinked and crosslinked chitosan-coated clay beads. 
Epichlorohydrin (ECH) was selected as the crosslinker. An advantage of ECH is that it 
does not eliminate the cationic amine function of chitosan. The possibility of the beads 
being regenerated and reused is also investigated.   
 
2. Materials and Methods 
 
2.1 Chemicals and reagents 
 
Low-molecular weight chitosan and bentonite were procured from Sigma Aldrich. 
Epichlorohydrin (ECH), used as the crosslinking agent, was also supplied by Sigma 
Aldrich. Copper (II) Sulfate Anhydrous (CuSO4, 99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99%) 
and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) were purchased from Merck KGaA. Deionized (DI) 
water was used to prepare all solutions.  
 
2.2 Preparation of non-crosslinked chitosan-coated clay beads 
 
Non-crosslinked chitosan-coated clay beads were prepared by following the 
procedure described by Mariano et. al. [10]. Five grams of chitosan was dissolved in 
300mL 5% HCl for two hours. After dissolution, 100g of bentonite was added into the 
solution and the mixture was then stirred for another three hours at room temperature. 
The resulting viscous solution is hereafter called chitosan-clay solution. The 
chitosan-clay solution was then neutralized with 1N NaOH, which was added drop by 
drop, until beads were formed by precipitation of chitosan from the solution on the clay 
surface. The beads were then filtered from the solution, extensively rinsed with DI 
water to remove unreacted NaOH, and dried in vacuum oven at 65oC for 24 hrs. After 
drying, the beads were ground and sieved through ASTM sieve sizes #45 and #35. The 
beads are hereafter called non-crosslinked chitosan-coated bentonite (CCB) beads. 
Non-crosslinked CCB beads with size ranging from 0.35 mm to 0.7 mm were collected 
and used for non-crosslinked adsorption tests. 
 
2.3 Preparation of crosslinked chitosan-coated clay beads 
 
Crosslinked chitosan-coated clay beads were prepared by following the procedure 
described by Wan Ngah et. al. and Mariano et. al. [2,10] but with some modifications. 
2.873g of ECH was added into the chitosan-clay solution to obtain a 1:1 molar ratio of 
chitosan to ECH. The solution was then heated to a temperature of 45oC and was stirred 
for two hours. After two hours, the resulting solution was neutralized with 1N NaOH.  
Subsequent to the precipitation of chitosan on the clay surface, the beads were filtered 
from the solution, washed with DI water to remove unreacted NaOH and ECH, and 
dried in vacuum oven. The dried beads were ground and sieved through ASTM sieve 
sizes #45 and #35. The beads are hereafter called crosslinked chitosan-coated bentonite

The desorbed crosslinked CCB beads were then reused in the second adsorption 
step following the procedure stated above for batch experiments at contact time of four 
hours.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Effect of contact time 
 
Adsorption experiments were performed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Initial 
uptake of Cu2+ ions was very fast and began to stabilize at four hours. After this time, 
the adsorption capacity remains constant, or was minimal, if there was any.  This 
implies that equilibrium has been reached. Therefore, the adsorption parameters in this 
study were established at four hours contact time.  
 
3.2 Effect of pH 
 
Table 1 shows the effect of pH on the adsorption of Cu2+ by non-crosslinked and 
crosslinked CCB beads. In this study, the effect of pH was minimal at pH 2-4, but at pH 
1, the effect was significant.   The adsorption rapidly decreased from 99.87% at pH 4 
to 42.07% at pH 1 and from 99.98% at pH 4 to 33.70% at pH 1 for non-crosslinked and 
crosslinked CCB beads. This can be explained by the fact that at low pH (acidic 
solution), more protons will available to protonate amine groups to form groups –NH3+. 
Therefore competition existed between protons and Cu2+ ions for adsorption sites and 
adsorption capacity was decreased. While, at higher pH (basic solution), precipitation of 
copper hydroxide occurs simultaneously with the adsorption of Cu2+ ions, thus, enough 
heed must be taken in interpreting the adsorption capacity of the beads.

3.5 Adsorption isotherms 
 
The relationship between the amount of adsorbed metal and metal ion 
concentration remaining in solution is described by an isotherm model. Langmuir and 
Freundlich isotherm models are widely used and usually the most applicable. The 
Langmuir Isotherm can be described by: 
 
 
 
 
Where qe is the amount of Cu2+ adsorbed (mg/g), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of 
Cu2+ in solution (mg/L), KL is the Langmuir equilibrium constant (L/g) and b is 
Langmuir constant (L/mg). 
 
Langmuir isotherm is based on the assumptions that adsorption can only occur at a 
fixed number of definite localized sites, each site can hold only one adsorbate molecule 
(monolayer), all sites are equivalent and no interaction between adsorbed molecules, 
even on adjacent sites [12]. The reciprocal of Langmuir Isotherm was used in this study.  
 
 
 
 
where max *LK C b= . Cmax (g/mg) is the maximum amount of Cu2+ ions per unit weight 
of adsorbent to form monolayer coverage on the surface. 
 
Freundlich Isotherm can be described by: 
 
 
 
 
where KF and n are Freundllich constants. The linearized form of Freundlich Isotherm 
was used in this study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3 demonstrates that the Langmuir equation provides a reasonable 
description of the experimental data. This is confirmed by the high correlation 
coefficients, R2, for both non-crosslinked and crosslinked CCB beads. R2 are greater 
than 0.97 for both systems at all contact times and pH range studied, except for all 12 
and 24 hour contact time and pH 1 on non-crosslinked system.  
 
The slopes and intercepts of plot of 1/qe versus 1/Ce were used to calculate the 
maximum monolayer adsorption capacity, Cmax, and Langmuir constant, b. Table 2 
reports the calculated results. The fits for Cu2+ adsorption are quite well for both 
non-crosslinked and crosslinked CCB beads under the concentration range studied. 
Therefore, in this study, it is assumed that the adsorption of Cu2+ ions occurred through 
monolayer on homogeneous adsorption sites.

adsorption corresponding to the initial liquid concentration Co. In many cases, the 
pseudo-first order does not fit well to the whole range of contact time and is generally 
applicable over the initial stage of the adsorption processes [13]. 
 
On the other hand, the pseudo-second order model is expressed as: 
 
 
 
where k2 is the pseudo-second order rate constant (g/mg-min).

As shown in Table 2, the correlation coefficients, R2, for the pseudo-first order 
kinetic model were very low, indicating that the adsorption system does not follow 
pseudo-first order kinetic model. The slopes and intercepts of plot of t/qt versus t were 
used to calculate the pseudo-second order constant k2. The straight lines in Figure 5 
show a good agreement of experimental data with the pseudo-second order kinetic 
model for different Cu2+ concentrations. This suggests that the pseudo-second order 
kinetics is predominant and that the overall rate of Cu2+ adsorption appears to be 
controlled by the chemical process [13, 14].

As reported in Table 4, very low Cu2+ concentration was desorbed by water, only 
upto 0.02, 0.01, 0.30 and 3.37% for 100, 200, 1000 and 2000 mg/L of initial Cu2+ 
concentration respectively. This demonstrates the stability of bound Cu2+. However, 
most of the Cu2+ adsorbed was desorbed by strong HCl acid (pH 1), with 5.80, 33.25, 
51.92 and 62.89% for 100, 200, 1000 and 2000 mg/L of initial Cu2+ concentration 
respectively. This result indicates the good potential of recovering the adsorbed Cu2+ 
with subsequent reuse of adsorbent. Data also showed that the desorbed crosslinked 
CCB beads can be used in the 2nd step adsorption with removal rates of 99.91, 97.87, 
77.16 and 42.65% compared with 99.97, 99.43, 90.68 and 67.37% during the 1st step 
adsorption studies for 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/L Cu2+ concentration.   
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This study investigates the adsorption of Cu2+ ions on non-crosslinked and 
crosslinked CCB beads, including the effects of contact time, pH of solution, initial 
Cu2+ ion concentration and crosslinking.  The following results are obtained: 
 
1. For both non-crosslinked and crosslinked CCB beads, equilibrium was reached at 
four hours, although the whole contact time was 24 hours. The effect of pH was 
minimal at pH 2-4, but at pH 1, the effect was significant. An increase in initial Cu2+ 
concentration leads to an increase in the adsorption capacity of Cu2+. 
 
2. Non-crosslinked CCB beads showed higher adsorption capacity than crosslinked 
CCB beads in the entire pH range studied. However, the chitosan in non-crosslinked 
CCB beads was dissolved at pH 1. Whereas, crosslinked CCB beads can be used in 
very acidic solutions, which makes it a better candidate as adsorbent. 
 
3. Crosslinked CCB beads displayed better desorption results at higher HCl 
concentrations, which indicates that crosslinked CCB beads can be regenerated and 
reused to adsorb metal ions. 
 
4. Langmuir isotherm agrees very well with experimental data as evidenced by high 
correlation coefficients, R2. However, to fit the data by the Freundlich isotherm 
gives low R2 values. 
 
5. The pseudo-second order kinetic model agrees very well with the adsorption of 
Cu2+ ions on both non-crosslinked and crosslinked CCB beads in the entire ranges 
studied. On the contrary, the pseudo-first order kinetic model fits the experimental 
data poorly. This suggests that the rate limiting step may be the chemical adsorption 
but not the mass transport. 
 
6. The crosslinked CCB beads can be used when constructing filters along a 
contaminated stream of groundwater, or other applications in wastewater treatment.
