Abstract 
 
Bio-materials under consideration consist of 
soft and hard components, such as protein and 
mineral crystals. It is well known from other 
areas of continuum mechanics that the 
qualitative behaviour of solutions in the 
vicinity of bi-material interfaces essentially 
depends on the material models chosen. In 
particular, many models for inelastic 
behaviour of materials can lead to singular 
solutions in the vicinity of such interfaces. 
Such singularities can affect the accuracy and 
convergence of numerical solutions, unless 
the precise asymptotic behaviour of solutions 
in the vicinity of bi-material interfaces is 
taken into account. Analytic solutions provide 
one with great insights into a general 
mathematical structure of solutions. For this 
reason, two problems of different modes of 
deformation and for different material models 
have been solved. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
There are a number of rigid perfectly/plastic 
solutions obtained by inverse methods [1 – 3 
among others]. The monograph [1] also 
includes earlier solutions proposed by Prandtl 
and Nadai. In the case of problems with 
frictional interfaces, the friction law 
postulating that the friction stress at sliding is 
equal to a portion of the shear yield stress is 
usually adopted. A particular case of this 
friction law is the maximum friction law (the 
friction stress is equal to the shear yield 
stress). The maximum friction law is of 
special interest because the corresponding 
friction stress at sliding is higher or equal to 
the friction stress following from any other 
possible friction laws. Also, rigid 
perfectly/plastic solutions are singular in the 
vicinity of maximum friction surfaces [4]. 
Many of the aforementioned rigid 
perfectly/plastic solutions have been 
generalized on other rate-independent 
plasticity models, for instant, [5 – 9] where 
the double-shearing model proposed in [10] 
has been adopted. These solutions are singular 
in the vicinity of maximum friction surfaces 
as well. However, attempts to generalize the 
rigid perfectly/plastic solutions on rate-
dependent materials, as is necessary in the 
case of bio-materials under consideration, are 
not completely successful. It is convenient to 
divide such materials into two groups: 
viscoplastic fluids (the yield stress vanishes at 
zero strain rate) and viscoplasic solids (the 
yield stress is of a finite value at zero strain 
rate) [11]. In the present report, both 
viscoplastic solids and viscoplastic fluids are 
considered. It is possible to verify by 
inspection that the solution for compression 
of a viscoplastic layer between parallel plates 
proposed in [12] is not valid in the case of 
maximum friction law and predicts unrealistic 
results if the friction stress is less than the 
maximum friction stress, but still high enough. 
The solution for axisymmetric viscoplastic 
flow through infinite conical channels 
proposed in [13] does not satisfy the friction 
boundary conditions. Approximate solutions 
to the same and other similar problems found 
in [14, 15] are valid at very small friction

The system of equations (4) – (6) 
should be solved numerically. It has been 
shown however that the right hand side of 
equations (4) – (6), reduces to 00  at αθ =  
(friction surface). This causes a difficulty with 
numerical solution of this system. To 
overcome this difficulty, an asymptotic 
analysis of equations (4) – (6) has been 
performed. As a result, it has been found that

Using this representation the numerical 
solution to (4) – (6) has been found. All 
calculations illustrated in Figs. 2 to 8 have 
been performed at 1=w  ( ( )03w ω ξ= ). 
The dependence of A and B on the value of α 
is depicted in Fig.2. It is seen that B is always 
negative whereas A changes its sense at 
4πα =  such that it is negative at 4πα >  
and positive at 4πα < . Then, it follows 
from the solution that the equivalent strain 
rate is an increasing function of θ in the 
vicinity of the friction surface at 4πα <  and 
is a decreasing function of θ at 4πα > . Also, 
the solution demonstrates that at any fixed 
value of R the contact pressure becomes 
negative for sufficiently small r-values at 
4πα >  and for sufficiently large r-values at 
4πα < . It contradicts the friction law 
because one of its requirements is that the 
pressure is positive. However, it is a common 
defect of many solutions of this class. Also, 
the value of R can be chosen such that the 
positive pressure occurs on any finite portion 
of the friction surface. The stress and velocity 
fields have been calculated for several α-
values, including the special case 
corresponding to 4πα = . The solution is 
illustrated in Figs. 3 through 8 where the 
special case is shown by dash lines. The 
asymptotic expansions (7) – (9) have been 
used to obtain an accurate representation of 
the solution in the vicinity of the friction 
surface. The variation of the velocity 
components with angle θ is depicted in Figs.3

3. Compression of a viscous layer on a 
rigid fibre. 
 
The boundary value problem considered here 
consists of an axisymmetric deformation of 
viscous layer on a rigid fibre (Fig.9). The 
length of both the fibre and layer is 2L. It is 
convenient to introduce a cylindrical 
8 
 
approximately equivalent to the condition 
0q =  (Fig.9).  
The exact velocity boundary 
conditions are 
0ru =              (17) 
at r a=  and 
 
ru U= −             (18) 
at r b= .  The exact boundary conditions at 
the ends of the layer are replaced with an

 In order to use the solution for

proposed in [3] to replace the boundary 
condition (16) with

Prandtl’s formulation on axisymmetric 
deformation. The condition (21) is 
approximately equivalent to the condition 
0p =  (Fig.9). The average value of q (Fig.9)

Let the tensile stress at which the fibre breaks

f crσ σ=              (24) 
 
The analytic solutions to the problems 
formulated have been found. However, it has 
been shown that no solution exists at 1m = . 
Even though the solution exists at 1m < , 
quantitative results cannot be satisfactory for 
applications if the value of m is large enough. 
Of course, no firm recommendation on the 
method for choosing such a maximum 
admissible value of m can be made. The 
variation of the equivalent strain rate with ρ at 
different values of m may be used as an 
argument for making the decision in each 
specific case. The solution is rate-dependent 
and its dependence on the rate of loading is 
controlled by parameter α, 
( )02 3 nU aα ξ⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦ . However, it is seen 
from the solution that the equivalent strain 
rate is proportional to 1 nα . Therefore, it is 
sufficient to illustrate the behaviour of the 
equivalent strain rate at 1α = . In particular, 
its variation with ρ at 2b a =  and different 
values of m is depicted in Figure 10. 
It follows from the solution that the 
components of the stress tensor are 
proportional to α. Therefore, it is sufficient to 
illustrate the behaviour of these components 
at 1α = , even though the solution is rate-
dependent. In particular, the variation of the 
normal stress components with ρ at 2b a =  
and different values of m is depicted in 
Figures 11 to 13 in the case of Prandtl’s 
formulation and in Figures 14 to 16 in the 
case of Spencer’s formulation. The 
calculations have been performed at 10L a =

ABSTRACT 
 
     The behaviour of viscoplastic solutions in the vicinity of maximum friction surfaces is 
analyzed for two groups of viscoplastic constitutive equations, with and with no saturation stress. 
It is shown that the qualitative asymptotic behaviour of solutions for these two groups of 
constitutive equations is quite different. In particular, in the case of constitutive equations with a 
saturation stress the velocity field can be singular in the vicinity of maximum friction surfaces 
and the asymptotic behaviour of the equivalent strain rate can coincide with that in the case of 
rigid perfectly/plastic solutions. For rigid perfectly/plastic solids, an engineering theory for 
predicting the evolution of material properties in a narrow layer near frictional interfaces has 
been based on the concept of the strain rate intensity factor. The result obtained provides a basis 
for a generalization of this theory on viscoplastic materials. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
     The first general result related to asymptotic behaviour of the equivalent strain rate (the 
quadratic invariant of the strain rate tensor) has been presented in Sokolovskii (1956). In this 
work an asymptotic representation of solution in the vicinity of surfaces where the shear stress is 
equal to the shear yield stress has been obtained. It is quite straightforward to get from this 
analysis that the equivalent strain rate follows an inverse square root rule in the vicinity of such 
surfaces, i.e.

components of the strain rate tensor, D is the strain rate intensity factor, and y is the distance from 
the maximum friction surface. For quite general three-dimensional deformation of rigid 
perfectly/plastic material obeying a smooth yield criterion, Eq.(1) has been derived in Alexandrov 
and Richmond (2001), and for axisymmetric deformation of rigid perfectly/plastic material

The system of Eqs. (1) to (3) is equivalent to the Mises yield criterion, eq Y  , and its 
associated flow rule. It is assumed that Y s    as eq    where s  is the saturation 
stress, a material constant. At sliding, the maximum friction law for such materials is given by the 
following relation 
 
                                     3f s                                    (7) 
 
where f  is the friction stress. At sticking, the velocity boundary condition should be formulated 
at the friction surface instead of Eq.(7) but this case is not considered in the present paper.

where 0eq    is the dimensionless equivalent strain rate, and 0 ,   and   are material 
constants. Obviously, the tensile yield stress introduced in Eq.(8) satisfies all of the 
aforementioned conditions and the tensile yield stress at zero equivalent strain rate is given by 
 0 1s    .

BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM 
     Consider an infinite circular hollow cylinder of internal radius a  and external radius b  
subject to the system of loading consisting of normal and tangential stresses on its internal and 
external radii. Due to this system of loading the cylinder is both expanded and twisted. It is 
convenient to introduce a cylindrical polar coordinate system with its z-axis coinciding with the 
axis of symmetry of the cylinder. The rate of expansion of the internal radius will be denoted by 
a da dt . The external radius is fixed against rotation. Therefore, the velocity boundary 
conditions are 
 
                                   ru a       (10) 
 
at r a  and 
 
  0u       (11) 
 
at r b . Here ru  is the radial velocity and u  is the circumferential velocity. One of the stress

If   were known, this equation would determine   as a function of   in implicit form with a

     The solution obtained satisfies Eqs. (2) – (4), (9) and boundary conditions (10) – (12). It 
contains an undetermined function  a  which should be found from the friction boundary 
condition. It follows from Eqs.(13) and (15) that a necessary condition is

           4/           (23)
