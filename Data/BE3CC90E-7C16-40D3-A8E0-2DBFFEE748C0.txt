redistribution between these forms. In order to have 
a confidence in the future results we suggest a 
benchmark study of several approaches to the problem 
of the energy transport in solids and the energy 
exchange between different forms of energy. 
The project is directed to solving the fundamental 
problem of energy transport in solids with certain 
rheological and functional properties and energy 
exchange between the different forms of energy. Some 
experimental techniques are developed and used to 
measure the dynamic responses of mechanical and 
thermal quantities and compare with the theoretical 
results. 
This joint project will focus on several directions 
of investigations, namely, (i) development of a 
mechanical two-component model of complex rheology, 
(ii) waves in randomly heterogeneous elastic medium  
(iii) continuum and discrete approaches of wave 
propagation in elastic medium,  
(iv) wave propagation in non-homogeneous piezoelastic 
medium,  
(v) establishing experimental techniques for dynamic 
displacement, strain and temperature measurements. 
Finally, as a general conclusion to the project we 
intend to carry out the interpretation and comparison 
of the results obtained in the framework of each 
direction. They will be compared with each other with 
the strategic goal of exposing the general features 
of the process of energy exchange between the 
different forms of energy from a perspective of each 
approach. The experimental techniques established in 
the fifth direction will be used to perform the 
experimental measurements and compared with the 
theoretical computations provided in the first to 
fourth directions.

Modeling and Simulation of Thermo-Acousto-Elastic Waves in 
Solids with Rheological and Functional Properties 
 4 
Bilello et al. investigated the responses of a damaged scaled beam traversed by the moving mass and 
obtained rather good agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions [9]. They 
observed that the structural damage sensitivity had been increased under the interaction of the moving 
mass. However, in their work, a Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency at 30 Hz was 
employed to remove high frequency contents and thus time history of the entire transient response was not 
provided.  
Recently, some researchers employed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors to experimentally 
investigate the moving mass problem. The FBG sensors have advantages such as small sizes, good 
sensitivity, and good long-term stability [10]. Rodrigues et al. developed a long-term monitoring system 
on concrete bridges based on the FBG sensors [11]. Kang et al. investigated structural monitoring of a 
magnetic levitation guideway using multiplexed FBG sensor arrays. Since the maglev train is powered by 
high-voltage electric feeding systems, the FBG sensors are good choices since they are immune to 
electromagnetic interferences (EMI) [12].  
To actively control infrastructures such as bridges or cable-stayed bridges, active mass dampers 
(AMDs) [13] which actively move a mass to generate the damping force or active tendon control with 
collocated actuator/sensor pairs can be used [14]. For the problem of moving mass induced vibrations, 
active vibration control of structures under the moving mass is also an interesting topic. Several 
researchers have theoretically or numerically considered the active vibration control of a simply-supported 
beam under a moving mass. Abdel-Rohman et al. employed bending moment in terms of tension and 
compression forces with a single actuator to suppress vibrations due to the moving mass [15]. Sung 
studied active vibration control problem of the simply-supported beam under the moving mass by 
considering the optimal placements of piezoactuators [16]. Nikkhoo et al. provided another study by 
designing an optimal control algorithm with a time varying gain matrix using displacement-velocity 
feedback [17]. In the literature, effects such as inertia due to the changes in velocity and mass are 
considered to obtain valuable results, but only numerical analysis instead of experimental investigation is 
performed. Since natural frequencies of vibration, damping characteristics of the structures, speed of the 
moving mass, and even paths of the moving mass, would all affect the responses of the structures, it is 
worthwhile to investigate active vibration suppression for the moving mass problem experimentally. 
Due to advantages of being lightweight, low-cost, and possessing both sensing and actuation 
capabilities, piezoceramic actuators are usually employed in active control systems. However, small 
displacements provided by the piezoceramic actuators and the requirement of the power source are some 
of the limitations of using piezoceramics in real world applications [18]. Some researchers have tried to 
extend the applications of piezoceramics to real structures by implementing a number of actuators [19] or 
by employing large scale piezoceramic actuators [20]. Despite the abovementioned limitations, it is 
appropriate to employ piezoceramic actuators in labs to demonstrate control concepts. In this paper, we 
built a small-scale beam and experimentally investigate active vibration control of the moving mass 
problem using piezoceramic actuators and a fiber Bragg grating sensing system. Based on a method 
proposed by Chuang et al. [21, 22], a FBG sensor which can detect point-wise out-of-plane displacement 
of the beam is used. First, system identification of the beam is performed to obtain frequency response and

III.  MODELING OF A SIMPLY-SUPPORTED BEAM WITH PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATORS  
In this study, active suppression of a beam with a rail on its top surface and two piezoceramic actuators 
bounded on its bottom surface under a moving mass is investigated [16, 17]. Since the beam considered in 
this work has a hinge support at one end and a slide support at the other, it is modeled as a 
simply-supported beam. In order to provide information for an idealized situation, the model of the 
simply-supported beam with piezoceramic actuators is provided in this section according to the work of 
Sung [16]. However, it should be noted that the loading effects of the contact-type sensors, the realization 
of the idealized pin and slide supports, and the rail on the surface would affect the accuracies of the 
modeling. The governing equation can be expressed as

compensator; cς  and cω are the damping ratio and frequency of the compensator. By writing equations 
(13) and (14) in state-space form, one can find the stability condition. The closed-loop system is stable 
only if PPF s cK ω ω<  so that the stiffness matrix is positive definite. Active damping can be achieved by 
adjusting the natural frequency of the PPF compensator to be in the region of one of the structure’s natural 
frequency. If the transfer function of the PPF controller is

V.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The schematic diagram of the FBG-based sensing system is shown in Fig. 1. Light with relative flat 
spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1, is transmitted from a broadband source (BBS) with a wavelength ranging 
from 1520 to 1570 nm to an isolator, preventing the light from reflecting back to the light source. Then the 
light beam enters a FBG filter, which is attached to a translation stage, to form a transmittance spectrum. 
The translation stage is used to adjust the Bragg wavelength of the FBG filter to meet the optimal 
demodulation condition before performing the measurement. Finally, the light is directed to a FBG sensor 
by a circulator, and then the reflected light from the FBG sensor is transmitted back to the circulator and 
directed to the corresponding photodetector (PDA10CS, InGaAs amplified detector, Thorlabs, Inc) on the 
output channel. The electrical signals are recorded by an oscilloscope (LeCroy 64Xs) and fed back into a 
dSPACE DS1104 hardware to perform the active vibration suppression.  
As demonstrated in Fig. 1, tension or compression force applied on the FBG sensor would shift the 
Bragg wavelength and the variation of the intensity of the FBG sensor is demodulated by the transmittance 
spectrum of the FBG filter. A method proposed by Chuang et al. [21] is employed to set up a FBG as a 
displacement sensor in this work, where one end of the FBG is glued to a vertical translation stage and the 
other end to the sensing point with a mix of epoxy resin and hardener. If the FBG displacement sensor is 
set up vertically to the surface of the structure, out-of-plane displacement responses of the sensing point 
can be obtained. In this work, the FBGs (i.e., FBG sensor and FBG filter) are written in photosensitive 
single-mode fibers by using the phase mask technique with a KrF excimer laser (248 nm). The initial 
Bragg wavelength of the FBG displacement sensor is at 1560.65 nm while the Bragg wavelength of the 
filter is at 1560.61 nm. Both grating lengths of the sensor and filter are 10 mm. 
The beam structure used in our experiment is shown in Fig. 2. It is made of 6061 aluminum alloy. 
The dimensions of the beam are 50.0 mm in width, 500.0 mm in length, and 5.0 mm in thickness. To guide 
the moving mass, which is a steel ball, a steel rail is set up on the top surface of the beam. The depth of the

plot are shown in Fig. 4. The damping ratios of each mode are estimated from performing free vibrations

where na  is amplitude of 
thn  cycle. Based on the identified result and the stability analysis, the 
parameters of the PPF controllers are first designed through simulation results. Figure 5 shows control 
performances for free vibrations of the beam excited at the first mode (i.e., 77.07 Hz) by using different 
control parameters. If the responses shown in Fig. 5 are assumed to have the form 
,
−
=
bty ae  (20) 
the control performance gets better as parameter b  gets larger. In this work, the control parameters for 
the first mode are optimally tuned experimentally and chosen as 0.95=g  and 0.3=ς . By the same 
process, control parameters for the second mode are chosen as 0.61=g  and 0.51=ς . It should be noted 
that more modes can be considered as long as the stability condition is satisfied for the PPF controllers. 
However, usually the first few dominated modes are considered in applications of active vibration 
suppression. From identification results shown in Fig. 4 we can see that intensities of the first two modes 
are much larger than the rest two modes (i.e., 538.05 Hz and 687.83 Hz) within 1000 Hz considered in this 
work, therefore only the first two modes of the beam are considered and controlled by the PPF controller 
in the discussed moving mass control problem.  
    Two methods for generating moving mass loadings are considered to induce dynamic responses of 
the beam as shown in the photos in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). The first method (i.e., method 1) is directly rolling 
a steel ball, initially attached to an electromagnet by magnetic force, from a slide to the rail on the beam. 
The second method (i.e., method 2) is using a steel ball to hit another steel ball initially resting on the rail 
and cause the second ball to move along the rail on the beam. After hitting the resting ball, the first steel 
ball will directly fall out without touching the beam. Influences of the two methods on the transient 
responses of the beam will be discussed later.  
    To calculate the speeds of the balls in two methods, a high-speed camera (Pulnix TM-6740GE, 200 
frames/second) is employed to record the rolling history of the steel ball. Figure 6(c) overlaps the photos 
taken by the camera to indicate three critical locations of the moving mass in method 2, where at location 
 12 
reach their maximum, the STFT spectrogram is post-processed and the results are shown in the lower part 
of Fig. 9. From Fig. 9, we can see that the occurrence of the maximum intensity of a specific mode 
corresponds to a local maximum of the responses (e.g., responses at 0.464 s and 0.698 s correspond to 
maximum intensity of the second and the first mode of the beam, respectively). At 0.646 s, although there 
is no single mode reaching its maximum, the superposition of the modes reaches maximum and thus 
contributes to a maximum of the overall transient responses. It should be noted that the loading effect of 
the contact-type sensors (i.e., the proposed FBG displacement sensor in this work) would exist in the 
measurements, i.e., 120 Hz. Despite this drawback, from these results we can see that under moving mass 
loadings the excitations of different modes of the structure would accordingly affect vibration 
characteristics of the transient responses. 
    Next, active vibration control is performed using the PPF controller. The control results in time 
domain as well as the STFT results are shown in Fig. 10. The responses with control for the first three 
modes are shown in the dashed lines in STFT results. We can see that the effect of control becomes 
obvious after the first mode (i.e., 77 Hz) reaches its maximum. The control performance for the first mode 
is due to the fact that the overall responses are dominated by the first mode after this mode reaches its 
maximum and later after the ball leaves the beam to generate free vibrations. Furthermore, since only the 
first two modes are considered in the design of the PPF controller, the third mode is not suppressed 
effectively. Comparing the time domain responses with the STFT results shown in Fig. 10, we can see that 
effective suppression of the second mode at 0.408 s in frequency domain cause effective suppression of 
the responses in the time domain. For the first mode, the same result can be obtained at 0.670 s. 
    By taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on transient responses with and without PPF control, we 
can quantitatively calculate the control performance. Here, instead of using decibels, we calculate 
reductions of the intensities using percentages from the frequency spectrum. The results are shown in Fig. 
11(a). As a comparison, Fig. 11 (b) demonstrates control results when the beam is subjected to an impact 
loading by the steel ball. We can see that the power spectrum in the case of the moving mass loading (i.e., 
Fig. 11(a)) has many local peaks due to the fact that the mass moves to different locations on the beam at 
different time.  
Since direct rolling of the steel ball from the slide (i.e., method 1 as shown in Fig. 6(a)) cause 
obvious variations in the responses when the ball rolls to the location where the slide and the rail connects, 
the second method (as shown in Fig. 6(b)) that uses another ball to hit the resting ball on the rail is 
employed. Figures 12(a) to 12(d) show the transient displacement responses measured by the two sensors 
and specific instants obtained by the high-speed camera. We can see from Fig. 12 (a) that the proposed 
FBG displacement sensing system is able to detect occurrence when the two balls contact (i.e., 0.333 s). 
However, responses obtained from FS do not reveal the characteristic of sharp (although small) variation 
at this instant. Furthermore, since the slide has been moved a distance away from the beam to avoid 
contact between the first steel ball with the beam, the occurrence when the ball starts moving on the beam 
is later than in method 1 (i.e., 0.311 s as shown in Fig. 8 (b)). Figure 12(b) indicates the instant when the 
ball is passing by the FBG sensor. Compared with the results shown in Fig. 8(c), the interval between 
critical locations A and B shown in Fig. 6(c) is 0.238 s in method 2 and 0.153 s in method 1, indicating
