Abstract
In multi-relay cooperative networks, selecting the best relay to cooperate is known to be spectrally
efficient, provided that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available for relay selection. When
relays are mobile, the time-varying nature of fading channels challenges the provision of CSI and thus
the performance of best relay selection. In this paper, the joint deployment of dedicated relay station
(DRS) and mobile relay stations (MRSs) is considered, whereby the MRS selected based on CSI and the
stationary DRS simultaneously forward the overheard signal to the destination within the total power
constraint. Closed-form expressions for exact and asymptotic outage probability over non-identically
distributed links are derived, and comparisons with related schemes are conducted to demonstrate the
merits of the proposed scheme.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cooperative relaying is a promising technique to combat severe fading and propagation loss by
exploiting spatial diversity, and the achieved diversity benefit is known as cooperative diversity
(CD). In practical systems, CD can be implemented via the dedicated relay station (DRS), which
is a fixed infrastructure in the network [1], or through the mobile relay station (MRS), such as
3is always assisted by DRS while MRSs may not be available if none of them can decode. All
nodes are equipped with single antenna and half-duplex radios. Due to heavy shadowing, there
is no direct link between s and d. All the wireless channels are subject to independent fading,
and perfect CSI is available at the receiving end but not the transmitting side.
The communication between s and d is performed in two phases. In phase I, s broadcasts
the signal. In phase II, the MRS that can decode and has the best r-d link quality is selected,
as in ORS [4]. The selected MRS transmits simultaneously with DRS for cooperative relaying.
Because relays may not be synchronized, the concurrent transmission in phase II is implemented
through distributed space-time codes (e.g. distributed GABBA codes) [7] for two antennas. At
d, the received signals are decoded using maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, equivalent to
maximum ratio combining (MRC) method [8]. The above cooperative relaying scheme is referred
to as the hybrid scheme in this paper.
To characterize the distinct fading condition seen by MRSs and DRS, different channel
models are considered. For a MRS rk, the associated wireless links are modeled by mobile
Rayleigh fading channel with maximum Doppler frequency shift fdk such that the channel power
correlation coefficient ρk is given by J0(2pifdkτ), where τ is the feedback delay, J0(·) is he
zero-order Bessel function of the first kind. As to DRS, it is likely to be installed above roof
tops [1], where the source-relay and relay-destination channels may experience dissimilar fading
severities. In this work, Nakagami statistical model is used for modeling the DRS channels. We
use a general notation, ha,b, to denote the channel coefficient of the link between nodes a and
b, and assume E[|ha,b|]2 = 1 with E[·] denoting the expectation operator. Concerning power
constraint, s transmits with power P , while the same amount is shared by DMS and the selected
MRS. Let β denote the proportion of power allocated to a transmitter, and the AWGN noise
has the same variance N0 at each receiver. Then the instantaneous SNR can be expressed as
γa,b = β|ha,b|
2γ¯, with γ¯ := P/N0 representing the system SNR. The average received SNR
subject to pathloss is characterized by γ¯a,b = βγ¯ · (da,b/d0)−α, where da,b is the distance between
nodes a and b, d0 is the reference distance, and α is pathloss exponent.
III. EXACT OUTAGE PROBABILITY
Recall that in hybrid scheme, one of the MRS is selected from the decoding set denoted by
D. A MRS rk can decode successfully if the instantaneous capacity of the s-rk channel exceeds

k=1
bk
γ¯rk,d
and ξi = ρi+ γ¯ri,d(1−ρi)θ. For the DRS, the PDF of the end-to-end SNR
can be found by taking the derivative of (3) with respect to x, yielding [9, Eq. (6)]

Based on (5) and (6), the accumulated end-to-end SNR γs conditioned on D has the PDF given
by fγs(x) = fγb(x) ∗ fγ0(x) where ∗ denotes the convolution operator. Due to space limit, we
only present the CDF of γs, which is identical to PDout as

and
g = (λ1 + λ2). Finally, substituting (4) and (7) into (1) gives the average outage probability.
IV. HIGH SNR APPROXIMATION
Since the two diversity paths, namely, the one through DMS and the one through the selected
MRS, are independently combined, they can be treated separately when deriving high-SNR
approximation. Furthermore, all the MRSs tend to decode successfully in high SNR region.
Consequently, we can contrate on the case |D| = K. For the CSI-based AF relay channel over
Nakagami fading, Li et al. [13] presented accurate approximations for the statistics of the end-
to-end channel at high SNR. As to that of the selected MRS, the asymptotic PDF can be found
by expanding e−

some algebra, the asymptotic outage probability can be derived as

7We first depicts the outage probability of hybrid scheme in Fig. 1 in comparison with five
other schemes.
• Mobile scheme only uses the best MRS based on outdated CSI. In this case, the outage
probability can be obtained as in hybrid scheme except P |D|=0out = 1.
• Perfect scheme only uses the best MRS based on accurate CSI, corresponding to the
case ρ = 1.
• All scheme employs all MRSs without DRS.
• Fixed scheme utilizes the DMS only, whose outage probability is given by (3).
• Sub-MOP scheme proposed in [6] selects the best MRS rb using the knowledge of outdated
CSI denoted by γˆrk,d and ρk according to the rule: b = argmink∈D{ζkT exp(−µkγˆrk,d)}
where ζk = 1/(γ¯rk,d(1− ρk)) and µk = ρk/(γ¯rk,d(1− ρk)).

When the fading conditions of DRS and MRS are the same, i.e., m1 = m2 = 1, more power
should be allocated to the selected MRS to better utilize selection diversity.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this work, a joint deployment of fixed and mobile relays was proposed to overcome the
performance loss of best relay selection scheme due to outdated CSI. By letting the fixed and
the selected mobile relay stations transmit simultaneously with power allocation, no spectral effi-
ciency loss and extra power consumption are incurred. Exact and asymptotic outage probabilities
are derived for non-identically distributed links. Through comparisons with other related works
under various propagation conditions, we showed that the combined use of fixed and mobile
relays is promising even in low-SNR and high-mobility scenarios.

三、發表論文全文或摘要 
 In infrastructure-based wireless networks, installing multiple antennas on fixed relay 
stations provides an effective and low-cost solution to increase network capacity and 
combat hostile fading channels. Previous work on multi-antenna relays either assumes that 
only one relay available in the network without benefiting from relay cooperation or all 
relays are used to assist the source transmission resulting extensive loss of spectral 
efficiency and high burden to the diversity combiner. For multi-relay cooperative networks, 
adaptive incremental relaying (IR) is considered in this paper as the cooperative strategy 
for multiple fixed relays performing uncoded decode-and-forward (DF). Unlike previous 
work on adaptive IR, relays employ multiple antennas to enhance the received signal 
quality. Then a small number out of all available relays are used instead of them. In 
determining whether the rest of relays are needed, two kinds of mechanisms are 
considered, namely decoding and threshold test that characterize different operational 
complexity at the destination. For both cases, we derive closed-form expressions of the 
average outage probability over Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical and simulation 
results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive IR in the context of 
multi-antenna relays. 
四、建議 
 During the conference week, I had the chance to talk with some Chinese researchers 
about their job environments. It seems to me that that Chinese researchers work in an 
environment with much greater pressure from their education ministration system as 
compared to us in Taiwan. To fulfill various kinds of evaluations and so called KPI (Key 
Performance Indicator), they need to pay a lot attention on publishing as much as possible, 
namely, they are evaluated by their publication quantity. This seems to has twisted the 
definition of a decent researcher, as the one who can play the publication game very well 
can hardly do quality research. Perhaps it also explains that most of their research results 
presented in the conference lack of the novelty. 
 Overall, attending the IEEE ICCC’12 was a fruitful trip to me. Taking the chance, I 
was able to explore the city of Beijing and at the mean time, to share my research results 
with peer researchers. The conference covers numerous social events and comprehensive 
schedule of keynotes speeches, panel discussions and technical sessions, all together 
making the conference a big success.
