through the carbon membranes is considerably reduced as the gas selectivity increases
because of the disordered pore structure and diffusion resistance membranes. To tackle
this challenging issue, some strategies such as the synthesis of composite membranes by
incorporating silica have been envisaged [8], but it is still far from satisfactory. To solve
this challenging task, here we proposed a simple strategy to incorporate nanotubes into
the membranes that could significantly improve the gas flux without losing the selectivity
of membranes.
The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the use of polyimide as a precursor to
prepare CMSMs. In this study we reported a preparation of CMSMs by incorporating
MWCNT into the polymeric precursor polyimide in order to improve the permeation
performance of membranes. Further the membranes performance for CO2, O2 and N2 gas
molecules is compared with polyimide in terms of permeability and selectivity. All these
membranes characterized by FE-SEM to evaluate the surface morphology.
2. Experiment
2.1. Preparation of PI/MWCNT carbon membrane
Porous α- alumina disks of average pore size: 0.14 µm, diameter: 2.3 mm,
porosity: 40-48% were used as the membrane support. A commercially available
polyimide (PI) polymer purchased from Alfa Acer (USA) was used as a precursor in this
study. The chemical formula of polyimide (PI) is given in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Structure of polyimide.
A small quantity of dope solution containing 15wt% of polyimide (PI) in N-Methyl-
2-pyrolidone (NMP) was spread on the finely polished surface of alumina support by
means of the spin coating technique (spin velocity 5000 rpm, spin time ~15) , resulting in
a thin film of the polymeric layer on the support. The coated polymeric film was
immediately immersed into a coagulant bath consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA)-water
(1:1 ratio) at room temperature (~25°C) for approximately for 2 h. The gelled polymeric
layer was dried in air at room temperature and carbonized under vacuum by heating up to
500°C (heating rate 0.5°C /min) for 1 h. The carbonized samples were cooled slowly in
vacuum to room temperature. For preparing the PI/MWCNT mixed matrix coating
solution, 1.5g of MWCNT were dispersed in 98.5ml of NMP solvent with ultrasonic
dispersion for 2h. 1ml of this nanotube solution was mixed with required amount of 15%
PI polymer solution in 1:25 ratio and stirred constantly for 3h at 80°C. Thus the prepared
polymer/MWCNT solution was coated on an alumina supported disks by above
prepared by this one coating-time method could be find many pore from the top vies, the
gases having different molecular size still can separated by molecular sieving mechanism.
SEM picture of the surface of the PI/MWCNT membrane were shown in Fig. 1(d). The
MWCNT were difficult to see in the microscope and therefore assumed to be well
distributed.
3.2. Permeation measurements
From the results, as shown in Fig. 2, at 500 °C the gas permeability increases as the
kinetic diameter of the gas molecule decreases, from N2 to CO. All these facts indicate
that the transport of gas molecules through the carbon film takes place according to a
molecular sieve mechanism. This means that the microporosity of the carbon film is very
narrow and as a consequence, it can discern between gas molecules depending on their
molecular size.
