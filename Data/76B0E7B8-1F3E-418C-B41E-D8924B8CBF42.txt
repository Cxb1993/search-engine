許多研究學者針對正交分頻多工存取技術(Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiple Access, OFDMA)提出各式下載突衝(Downlink Burst)建置演算法，然而這
些演算法未考慮 IEEE 802.16標準所規範的下載突衝建置規則與相關特性。為了
提高 802.16 網路之吞吐值(throughput)，本報告提出最佳角落導向演算法(Best 
Corner Oriented, BCO)。BCO為了最大化吞吐值，除了考慮下載突衝建置規則之
外，也進一步處理以下三個突衝建置議題。首先，BCO 將突衝擺放至二維頻寬
地區的角落(Corner)讓未使用的頻寬資源集中在一個完整區塊以避免外部碎片
(external fragmentation)發生；另外，BCO縮小突衝面積以減少內部碎片(internal 
fragmentation)；最後，BCO 衡量每個角落的頻道品質，並把突衝放置在擁有最
好頻道品質的角落以使用較好的調變技術來提高傳輸速度。根據模擬結果，在大
量的網路流量情況下，BCO提供的吞吐值分別可達到過去演算法的 2至 9倍。 
執行本研究計畫時，我們發現不同的資料鏈結層設計會顯著影響車輛隨意
網路之傳輸層協定的吞吐值，且改善傳輸層協定無法顯著提昇車輛隨意網路之吞
吐值。因此本研究計畫透過改善 IEEE 802.16資料鏈結層的頻寬分配方式來提昇
車輛隨意網路的吞吐值，研究成果已被國際期刊 EURASIP Journal on Wireless

1. Instruction 
Because IEEE 802.16 uses the technique of Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (OFDMA), the bandwidth resources are represented by a 
two-dimensional area of slots, in which the two dimensions are time in units of 
symbols and frequency in units of subchannels [1]. Therefore, the bandwidth 
allocation in IEEE 802.16 must consider the construction of a two-dimensional 
bandwidth area, called a burst, assigned to a connection. 
The subchannel diversity should be considered when constructing bursts. 
Subchannel diversity means that a connection uses a different modulation coding 
scheme (MCS) on various subchannels because the connection encounters various 
channel qualities on various subchannels [2]. Therefore, for each connection, each 
burst must be constructed in its corresponding best-quality subchannels, that is, the 
subchannels on which the connection receives the optimal channel quality to 
maximize bandwidth usage. Several algorithms for the IEEE 802.16 burst 
construction problem were proposed to obtain the higher throughput. A number of 
researchers regarded this problem as a Maximum Matching problem and attempted to 
determine the optimal matches between bursts and subchannels [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. 
The IEEE 802.16 standard defines a number of specifications to alleviate the 
overhead of management messages and to concentrate the transmission power on 
specific subchannels for battery-powered devices, as follows: (1) the burst must be a 
continuous bandwidth area, (2) the shapes of the bursts used in downlink and uplink 
transmission should be rectangular and multi-rectangular, respectively, and (3) one 
burst should use only one MCS based on the worst signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among 
the assigned subchannels [1, 9]. 
The previous researches that focused on the Maximum Matching problem 
violated the specifications in IEEE 802.16 standard, and are thus unpractical. 
Therefore, a number of researchers regarded the burst construction problem as a 
variant of the Bin Packing problem. So-In designed the enhanced One Column 
Striping with non-increasing Area first mapping algorithm (eOCSA), which constructs 
each burst from bottom right to top left of the available bandwidth area [10]. Wang 
developed the Weighted Less Flexibility First algorithm (WLFF), which constructs 
each burst on the best edge selected in the free bandwidth area1 [11]. The best edge is 
the edge on which a constructed burst generates the minimal variance of the 
sub-blocks in the free bandwidth area. Thus, constructing the burst on this best edge 
provides the most flexibility for the following burst construction. eOCSA and WLFF 
conform to the specification (1) and (2); however, they completely neglect subchannel 
diversity and the specification (3).  
A number of issues must be addressed to conform to the specifications and

layer with OFDMA are Time Division Duplex (TDD), Frequency Division Duplex 
(FDD), and Half-duplex Frequency Division Duplex (H-FDD). The TDD is the most 
attractive duplex mode because of its flexibility. Additionally, the modulation method, 
that is quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16 quadrature amplitude modulation 
(16QAM), or 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (64QAM), and the associated 
coding rate for data transmission are selected according to the channel quality, that is, 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 
An IEEE 802.16 frame for downlink and uplink transmissions is divided into 
downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) subframes in the time domain of the TDD mode (the 
right part of Fig. 1). A burst is an allocated bandwidth assigned to one dedicated 
connection of one SS and is formed by slots. A slot is the minimal bandwidth 
allocation unit, and consists of one subchannel and one to three symbols. A 
subchannel is the smallest allocation unit in the frequency domain, and a symbol is 
the smallest allocation unit in the time domain. A number of other fields in a frame 
provide specific functions. For example, Preamble synchronizes each SS, 
DL/UL-MAP describes the position and measure of each downlink/uplink burst, and 
FCH (frame control header) specifies DL subframe prefix and the length of DL-MAP 
message. 
In the IEEE 802.16, the SS must acquire bandwidth from the BS before 
transmitting or receiving data. On downlink, the BS broadcasts to all SSs, and each 
SS picks up its destined packets. On uplink, SSs must inform the BS of the bandwidth 
they require for data transmission by sending a bandwidth request (BWR). Upon 
receiving the BWRs, the BS allocates the bursts in an uplink subframe to each SS, and 
subsequently broadcasts this information through UL-MAP. After receiving UL-MAP, 
each SS uses the allocated burst to transmit its data.

Figure 2. An example of constructing a downlink burst 
 
Fig. 2 shows an example of the construction of a downlink burst for a connection 
with fifteen slots allocated by the flow scheduler. For simplicity, the SNR of each 
subchannel is transformed into its corresponding MCS (bytes/slot). A downlink burst 
can be presented as a rectangle with a height-width pair (h,w) placed on a starting slot 
(y,x), which is represented by a row-column manner, for example, 
[(y,x),(h,w)]=[(0,0),(3,5)], as shown in Fig. 2. The MCS used by this burst is 9 
bytes/slot, which is the worst MCS of its occupied subchannels, that is, subchannel 0 
to subchannel 2. 
2.3. Related Works 
Because the construction of bursts that can provide the optimal throughput is a 
NP-hard problem [9], several algorithms were proposed to raise throughput and were 
classified as the Max Matching solutions and Bin Packing solutions. The objective of 
Max Matching solutions for burst construction is to assign bursts to their best-quality 
subchannels. Therefore, the researchers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] transformed this problem into 
a Max Matching problem and attempted to determine the optimal matches between 
bursts and subchannels to maximize the throughput. Sheu utilized the Hungary 
algorithm, which is a commonly used combinatorial optimization algorithm for the 
assignment problem with m connections and m subchannels [3]. His approach first 
forms a subchannel assignment matrix in which each row represents one connection 
and each column represents one subchannel. The entry in the matrix indicates the 
channel condition with regard to a connection, for example, SNR. The Hungary 
algorithm is subsequently applied to determine the optimal connection-subchannel 
match. Chen proposed the Dynamic Frequency Selection approach (DFS), in which 
each connection selects its subchannel according to the probability distribution, where 
the selection probability is determined by channel quality [4]. Toufik presented a 
  9
Table 1 shows the summary of these methods. The complexity refers to the time 
complexity consumed by the burst construction algorithm. The required bandwidth 
implies that the algorithm not only considers the allocated slots, but also considers the 
requested bandwidth during burst construction. This is because the bandwidth 
provided by the allocated slots may exceed the required bandwidth of the connection 
when the burst is constructed on good-quality subchannels. Therefore, these unused 
slots can be further utilized by the other bursts if the algorithm extra considers the 
requested bandwidth.

3. Problem Statement 
This section first defines a number of used notations and formally states the 
problem of the two-dimensional downlink burst construction.  
 
3.1 Notations 
 
A two-phase bandwidth allocation is used, as described in subsection 2.1. Let 
  11 
iNOS  The number of occupied slots by iB . 
iMCS  The MCS adopted by iB . 
iTh  Throughput achieved by iC   
 
3.2 Problem and Issues.

Inefficient bandwidth usage must be eliminated to solve this problem. The 
following issues must be carefully considered when designing a downlink burst 
construction algorithm. 
1. External Fragmentation. A downlink burst with a rectangular shape may 
cause external fragmentation. External fragmentation refers to the division of 
available slots into small pieces that cannot meet burst requirements. Fig. 3(a) 
shows an example of a connection 1C  with 1A =12 slots. The burst 1B  
cannot be constructed because the free bandwidth was divided into pieces 
that were too small to accommodate 1B , although the total free bandwidth 
was sufficient for 1A . 
2. Internal Fragmentation. The number of occupied slots, iNOS , must equal 
the allocated number of slots, iA , for any connection iC . However, the 
throughput provided by iA  may exceed iW  when the burst iB  is 
constructed in an optimal block and thus, has an excellent iMCS . This 
causes internal fragmentation, which means that only some slots within a 
burst are used to transmit data, and the remaining are wasted. Fig. 3(b) shows 
an example of internal fragmentation in that 1C  only uses 10 slots to 
transmit data, and the remaining 2 slots are wasted. 
3. Optimal Block Exploration. The SS experiences various levels of SNR on 
different subchannels resulting from variable noises on each subchannel. The 
burst must be constructed in its corresponding optimal block, that is, a block 
in which a number of continuous subchannels have excellent SNRs, and thus, 
it can use a satisfactory MCS. Thus, if the burst constructer constructs each 
burst on its corresponding inferior-quality subchannels and uses a low MCS; 
the bandwidth is inefficiently used. An example of optimal block exploration 
shown in Fig. 3(c), in which the throughput of 1C  is low when 1B  is 
constructed in an inferior block (that is, subchannels 1, 2, and 3), whereas the 
throughput is high when 1B  is constructed in an optimal block (that is, 
subchannels 5 and 6).

4. Best Corner Oriented Algorithm (BCO) 
BCO not only complies with the downlink burst structure specified in IEEE 
802.16 standards, but also considers the issues discussed in subsection 3.2. To avoid 
external fragmentation, BCO maintains all free slots as a continuous area by 
constructing each burst in the corner. To minimize internal fragmentation, BCO 
expands the burst by one slot height in steps. At any step, if the throughput of the 
constructed burst exceeds the requested bandwidth, the burst is large enough and is 
not further expanded, even when the number of occupied slots is smaller than the 
number of allocated slots, that is, i iNOS A< . To explore an optimal block, BCO 
constructs a virtual burst in various corners, and subsequently selects the best corner 
in which the burst provides the largest throughput. 
4.1. Definition of Corners 
BCO avoids external fragmentation by constructing a burst starting from the 
corner and limiting it by the bounded width and height. The corner, bounded width, 
and bounded height are formally defined as follows: given the available bandwidth 
area before constructing the i-th burst, the edge set, Ei, surrounding this area in a 
counterclockwise order is defined by 0 0 1 1{ , , , , , , , , , }j j J Ji i i i i i i i iE H V H V H V H V= L L ,

Lemma: Provided with a downlink subframe of M N´  slots and number of 
connections, L, the available bandwidth area is continuous if each downlink burst is 
constructed in the corner. 
 
Proof: Mathematical induction is applied to prove the claim. For L=1, which 
indicates that only one burst is required to be constructed, the free slots are 
maintained as a continuous area after this burst is constructed in 0
jCR  and limited by 
0
jH  and 0
kV .  
Suppose that all free slots are maintained as a continuous area when L=s. When 
L=s+1, the (s+1)-th burst is constructed in one of the corners (that is, 1
j
sCR + ) and 
limited by the corresponding 1
j
sH +  and 1
k
sV + . Constructing burst in 1
j
sCR +  
maintains this burst adjacent to other constructed bursts. In addition, limiting the burst 
by 1
j
sH +  prevents the horizontal division of the continuous free bandwidth area. 
Conversely, constructing burst in 1
j
sCR +  and limiting it by 1
k
sV +  prevent the vertical 
division of the continuous free bandwidth area. Consequently, the free slots, after 
  17
insufficient to accommodate a burst with Ai slots. Therefore, the burst should be 
shrunk by using | jiH | as its width. The exact calculations of w1 and w2 are described 
in the next subsection. 
Furthermore, examining each possible height of a burst can avoid the 
phenomenon of throughput anomaly. The throughput anomaly indicates that a burst 
with a large height may anomaly cause lower throughput than a burst with a small 
height when the burst with a large height uses an inferior MCS. Figure 5 shows an 
example in which the throughput provided by the burst B(h=3), referring to the burst 
with height 3, is considerably lower than that provided by the burst B(h=2) because 
B(h=3) used an inferior MCS, although B(h=3) is larger than B(h=2). In this case, a 
burst with a small height that provides large throughput should be constructed to 
avoid slot waste.

BCO applies a saving variable to efficiently use the unused allocated slots of 
each burst to improve throughput. This is because the flow scheduler usually allocates 
the total number of slots of the downlink subframe to each connection, indicating that 
the sum of all allocated slots equals the total number of slots in the downlink 
subframe. In this case, even when satisfying the requested bandwidth by fewer slots to 
avoid internal fragmentation, the saved slots are still not utilized. Therefore, BCO 
uses saving to record the number of total saved slots to allow subsequent bursts to use 
the saved slots conserved from the previous bursts. As shown in line 12, the unused 
slots after constructing iB , that is, NOSCal( )i iA B- , are added to the parameter, 
saving. Subsequently, the latter connection 1iC +  has 1iA saving+ +  slots to construct 
1iB + , as shown in line 21. Therefore, each burst not only uses its own allocated slots, 
but also applies the additional saving slots to fulfill its required bandwidth. The use of 
this parameter prevents two unfavorable phenomena, as follows: the waste of unused 
slots internal to the bursts constructed on optimal subchannels and the bandwidth 
dissatisfaction of connections whose bursts are constructed on inferior subchannels. 
Thus, this approach enhances the total throughput.

number of loops to evaluate each possible height-width pair. BCO executes the 
ConstructBurst function t times, where t is the average number of corners, therefore, 
the required complexity is O( )st . Therefore, the time complexity of BCO at 
constructing the burst for the i-th connection is O( ) O( ) O( ) O(1)M st s+ + + . The time

5. Simulations 
Simulations were performed to compare the proposed BCO algorithm with 
eOCSA and WLFF in terms of total throughput and the improvement ratio. The 
improvement ratio was defined as ( ) /B A AT T T- , where BT  and AT  were the 
throughputs achieved by BCO and by the A algorithm, respectively. The internal and 
external unused slot ratios of all algorithms were also compared to observe the 
internal fragmentation and external fragmentation, respectively. The internal unused 
slot ratio (IUSR) was defined as /inUS TS , where inUS  is the number of unused 
slots internal to constructed bursts and TS  is the number of total slots within a DL 
subframe. The external unused slot ratio (EUSR) was defined as /exUS TS , where 
exUS  is the number of unused slots external to all constructed bursts. 
The simulations investigated the effects of requested bandwidth, the number of 
connections, the channel quality, and the variation of channel quality between 
subchannels on the total throughput, the improvement ratio, IUSR, and EUSR. 
5.1. Simulation Model 
The simulation environment was an IEEE 802.16 OFDMA system with a 20 
MHz frequency band. The numbers of subchannels and symbols for a downlink 
subframe were set to 60 and 24, respectively. Thus, one subchannel had 12 downlink 
slots, and one downlink slot occupied two symbols. According to the received SNR, 
various MCSs were used, including QPSK1/2, QPSK3/4, 16QAM1/2, 16QAM3/4, 
64AQM2/3, and 64QAM3/4 [1].  
  23
slots can be used by the following unconstructed bursts with insufficient allocated 
slots. In addition, BCO constructs a burst in the optimal corner to avoid external 
fragmentation and to explore an optimal block. Thus, it achieves a superior 
throughput than eOCSA and WLFF. Figs. 7(a) and 7(d) reveal that, when the 
requested bandwidth is less than 700 Kbps, BCO achieves the targeted bandwidth 
with fewer slots, and thus, owns higher EUSRs, because the constructed shrunken 
bursts already provide sufficient bandwidth, that is, ( , )i iTHCal i B W= . However, the 
EUSR decreases when the required bandwidth increases because more slots are 
required to fulfill the increasing required bandwidth. 
Although the requested bandwidth increases, the throughput should become 
stable when most slots are used (requested bandwidth exceeds 700Kbps for BCO). 
However, in this case, the situation is not actually saturated and their throughputs 
slightly increase, because, although most slots are used, the burst generally satisfies 
its requested bandwidth by fewer slots when using an optimal MCS and leaves the 
unused free slots of the allocated slots to other bursts that use inferior MCSs. That is, 
the minority of slots in the downlink subframe use optimal MCSs, and the majority 
use inferior MCSs. The area of the burst using an optimal MCS increases in 
conjunction with the bandwidth to satisfy the requested bandwidth, and the unused 
slots, which are left to other bursts with lower MCSs, decrease. Consequently, more 
slots in the downlink subframe use optimal MCSs and fewer slots use inferior MCSs. 
Therefore, the throughput slightly increases. However, a saturated condition is 
eventually achieved when most slots are efficiently used. Some of the bandwidth area 
with inferior channel quality remains unused (approximately 10 %) even when the 
traffic load is heavy, as shown in Fig. 7(d), because BCO shrinks the bursts to prevent 
throughput anomaly and achieves higher overall throughput, as explained in Section 
4.2. 
Fig. 7(b) demonstrates that the improvement ratios of BCO increased in 
conjunction with the requested bandwidth because eOCSA and WLFF reached a 
saturated condition, whereas BCO did not reach a saturated condition. Under the 
heavy load of 1Mbpps, BCO achieved 2 and 9 times the throughput achieved by 
eOCSA and WLFF, respectively.

5.4. Channel Quality 
The effects of the channel quality on the total throughput were investigated. In 
this simulation, the mean SNR of the subchannels received by each SS was varied 
from 10 db to 20 db, and the standard deviation was maintained at 5 db. Fig. 9(a) 
reveals that the total throughputs of BCO, eOCSA, and WLFF increase because a 
high mean SNR provides bursts with more opportunities to use better MCSs. Fig. 9(b) 
demonstrates that the improvement ratios of BCO decreased as the channel quality 
increased. Two main reasons were determined for this occurrence. First, eOCSA and 
WLFF did not consider subchannel diversity, and thus, failed to address optimal block 
exploration. Therefore, the increase of throughput was caused by the higher channel 
quality. However, because BCO considered optimal block exploration, it achieved 
satisfactory throughput, even when the mean SNR was low. Therefore, as the mean 
SNR increased, the increasing slope on throughput in BCO was smaller than that in 
  27
from 0 db to 10 db. Fig. 10(a) reveals that BCO surpassed eOCSA and WLFF when 
the standard deviation was 0, that is, all subchannels had the same channel quality. In 
this case, eOCSA and WLFF generated internal fragmentation and external 
fragmentation; however, BCO alleviated these problems, as shown in Figs. 10(c) and 
10(d), respectively. 
In addition, Fig. 10(a) demonstrates that the total throughputs of eOCSA and 
WLFF decreased considerably as the standard deviation of the SNR increased, 
whereas that of BCO changed slightly. Consequently, the improvement ratio of BCO 
increased considerably, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The numbers of subchannels with 
optimal SNRs and subchannels with inferior SNRs increased in conjunction with the 
standard deviation of the SNR. Because one burst only uses a MCS based on the 
worst SNR of all assigned subchannels, eOCSA and WLFF do not consider the 
channel quality and will construct the bursts on the subchannels with inferior or 
unacceptable SNRs, resulting in a high IUSR (Fig. 10(c)) as the standard deviation of 
the SNR increases. However, in this case, the throughput of BCO decreased slightly 
because it considered optimal block exploration at constructing bursts. Fig. 10(d) 
reveals that the EUSR of BCO slightly increased in conjunction with the variation of 
the channel quality.

bandwidth. The feedback information will help the flow scheduler to assign an 
accurate number of slots for each connection. In the future, we will investigate a 
feedback mechanism for the burst constructer and the scheduling mechanism for the 
flow scheduler. In addition to maximizing the overall throughput, QoS support is also 
a crucial topic. Thus, enhancing BCO with supporting QoS is the focus of our future 
studies.

一、參加會議經過 
本人於十月十日至十月十二日間參加在中國上海舉行之WiMoB 2011「The 
7th IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Networking and 
Communications」 會議，並於十月十三日至十月十四日參加在中國杭州舉行之
ISCIT 2011 (The 11th IEEE international Symposium on Communication sand 
Information Technologies)，此二個會議皆為每年開一次會，主要參加者涵蓋全球
各大學或產業界從事資訊及通訊相關研究之學者或研究人員，在此領域是屬於
非常重要的國際會議。 
本次行程簡述如下：十月九日搭機直飛杭州後並立即轉往上海，WiMoB會
議於十月十日開幕，當天即辦理報到，第二天上午及笫三天上午為 Keynote 
Speech，會議共有 12個場次、200餘篇論文發表，同時也包括兩個 workshop。
參加完此會議後，於十月十二日晚間前往杭州，於次兩天參加於杭州舉行之
ISCIT，此會議的時間為十月十二日至十月十四日，但因十二日與 WiMoB 相衝
突，故僅參加後兩日的會議。本次參與此兩個會議，聆聽多篇論文發表並參與
討論，十月十四日會議結束後，於十月十五日搭機返回台灣。 
 
二、與會心得 
WiMoB會議共有超過 200篇論文發表，分成 12個場次以口頭報告方式發
表，每一時段有二個場次並行，其重要主題如下： 
* Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks 
* Performance Analysis 
* Routing 
* Security and Privacy 
想，這可能是一些沒留學過的學者之通病，建議國科會能多獎勵國內學
者的國外研究及補助，促使大家能有機會多多訓練英語發表。 
(3) 此次會議，與各國學者討論，得知各國大學訓練資訊人員的人數都大幅
增加，以因應未來的趨勢，而國內在資訊領域的人才也是供不應求，而
通訊網路領域的人才更是欠缺，為了發展知識經濟，人才培育是非常重
要的課題，值得有關單位深思，並及早規劃。 
 
最後，個人非常感謝國科會給予補助，參與此次會議，有機會與世界各國
的學者交換彼此的經驗及研究心得，對本人未來的研究助益頗大。

許多研究學者針對正交分頻多工存取技術(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple 
Access, OFDMA)提出各式下載突衝(Downlink Burst)建置演算法，然而這些演算法未考慮
IEEE 802.16 標準所規範的下載突衝建置規則與相關特性。為了提高 802.16 網路之吞吐值
(throughput)，本報告提出最佳角落導向演算法(Best Corner Oriented, BCO)。BCO 為了
最大化吞吐值，除了考慮下載突衝建置規則之外，也進一步處理以下三個突衝建置議題。
首先，BCO 將突衝擺放至二維頻寬地區的角落(Corner)讓未使用的頻寬資源集中在一個完
整區塊以避免外部碎片(external fragmentation)發生；另外，BCO 縮小突衝面積以減少
內部碎片(internal fragmentation)；最後，BCO 衡量每個角落的頻道品質，並把突衝放
置在擁有最好頻道品質的角落以使用較好的調變技術來提高傳輸速度。根據模擬結果，在
大量的網路流量情況下，BCO 提供的吞吐值分別可達到過去演算法的 2至 9倍。 
 
執行本研究計畫時，我們發現不同的資料鏈結層設計會顯著影響車輛隨意網路之傳輸層協
定的吞吐值，且改善傳輸層協定無法顯著提昇車輛隨意網路之吞吐值。因此本研究計畫透
過改善 IEEE 802.16 資料鏈結層的頻寬分配方式來提昇車輛隨意網路的吞吐值，研究成果
已被國際期刊 EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (SCI 
Expanded, IF=0.815)接受，如下所示：
