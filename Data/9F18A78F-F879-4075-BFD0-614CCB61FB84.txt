Abstract 
 
This research aims to investigate the control 
mechanism for the related parameters of evaporator 
while the touch panel (TP) is on its multi-layer coating 
process. This research is a kind of technique application 
development research. The neural network is used as the 
tool to find the accurate control mechanism while the 
panel with multi-layer coating needs to be proceeded by 
using the evaporator. The complex relationships among 
the TP color, transmittance and the evaporation 
parameters will be studied. A fast and precise intelligent 
manufacturing control mechanism of evaporation process 
is expected to be developed so that the intelligent 
technique could be practically used in the real industrial 
applications.

network, intelligent, evaporation 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
Recently, TP has become an important part of 
electronic appliance in human’s daily life. It is widely 
used in many products such as the mobile phone, 
electronic dictionary, GPS navigation system, MP3 and 
TV screen, etc. In the manufacturing process of TP, a 
thin plate with coating film will be stuck on TP screen as 
the decoration film. Such film can not only protect the 
screen of TP, but also provide the specific optical 
function. The coating process is to deposit one or more 
layers of material onto the substrate and it is usually 
done by evaporator [1-6]. The evaporation process is 
generally processed in the vacuum condition. Figure 1 
shows the principle of coating process. The number of 
layers of coating will depend on the special function of 
TP needed. In fact, the decoration film has become a 
necessary and indispensable part TP.

Optical Inc.) 
 
As mentioned, the process of film’s decoration is 
usually done by the vacuum evaporator. However, before 
the evaporation process is started, the control parameters 
of evaporator need to be set by the full experienced 
technician to ensure the whole coating process could be 
accomplished successfully. In fact, the success of 
evaporation process might be affected by many factors, 
including the coating target composition, the layers of 
evaporation, the thickness of film, the position of plate 
quasi-Newton method, is used for neural network 
training. For NN-2 model, the learning steps can be 
summarized as follows [11].

III.  Simulations 
 
A. Transmittance Estimation 
 
In this study, the touch panel decoration film with 
two layers coating was studied. The coating targets are 
Cr and 32OCr . Table 1 lists the example of data 
collected. The information of data includes the value of 
quartz crystal deposition monitor, the rotation speed of 
holder, the substrate position of panel placed, Cr 
thickness, 32OCr  thickness and transmittance. The 
complex relationship between film’s transmittance and 
its possible influencing factors is expected to be obtained 
by NN model automatically. In order to fairly 
demonstrate the feasibility of NN model, four different 
data sets named Set-1, Set-2, Set-3 and Set-4, were 
randomly re-organized from the original data base. For 
each data set, 100 points were used for network’s 
training and 44 points were used for testing. MAE and 
MAPE are used as the measurements of NN 
performance.

1. Simulations by NN Model with Newton’s Learning 
Algorithm 
 
In this research, the Newton’s learning algorithm is 
taken as the training rule for neural network. Different 
input combinations were performed by NN model. Table 
2 lists the best error statistics performed by NN model 
with five inputs. In other words, the quartz crystal 
deposition monitor, the rotation speed of holder, the 
substrate position of panel placed, Cr thickness and 
32OCr  thickness are all important influencing factors 
for TP’s transmittance. However, from the simulation 
results shown, the network with four inputs, the quartz 
crystal, holder’s rotation speed, Cr thickness and 32OCr  
thickness, has a better performance either. That means

B. Chromatic aberration estimations 
 
In this section, the chromatic aberration estimations 
of decoration film with two layers coating were studied 
simulated. Table 8 shows the example of data simulated. 
The variables of data include the value of quartz crystal 
deposition monitor, rotation speed of holder, substrate 
position Cr thickness , 32OCr  thickness and L. a. b. 
values of chromatic aberration. The complex 
relationships among film’s L. a. b. values and their 
possible influencing factors are expected to be developed 
by NN models. Again, in order to demonstrate the 
feasibility of models used, four different data sets; Set-1, 
Set-2, Set-3 and Sst-4 were randomly re-organized based 
on the original data. For each data set, 100 points were 
used for model’s training and 44 points were used for 
testing. MAE and MAPE are used as the measures of 
every NN model’s performance.

1. Simulations by NN Model with Newton’s Learning 
Algorithm 
 
Same as the previous studies, the Newton’s learning 
algorithm is taken as the training rule for neural network. 
The complex relationships among film’s L. a. b. values 
and these five possible influencing factors are expected 
to be developed by NN model with different input 
combinations. 
 
Table 9 lists the error statistics of L estimations 
performed by NN model with different input variables. 
From the simulation results shown, we found that the 
estimations made by NN with five inputs are best. In 
other words, the quartz crystal deposition monitor, the 
rotation speed of holder, the substrate position of panel 
placed, Cr thickness and 32OCr  thickness are all 
important influencing factors for TP’s L value. Figure 3 
presents the superposition curves of L estimations for 
data Set-1. This figure shows that it is also quite 
promising and accurate by using NN model in the 
application of TP’s L value’s estimation with two layers 
coating.

3. Simulations by QNN Model 
 
In this section, all simulations were re-done by 
QNN model. The size of QNN model is m-2-2-1 . Except 
the number of input nodes depends on the input variables 
used, the nodes of two hidden layers and output layer are 
all fixed.  
 
Table 15 presents the error statistics of L value’s 
estimations by QNN model with inputs, quartz crystal, 
holder’s rotation speed, Cr thickness and 32OCr

IV.  Conclusion 
 
In this research, the transmittance and chromatic 
aberration estimations of TP decoration film by using 
neural networks were presented. The complex 
relationships among transmittance, chromatic aberration 
and all possible evaporation parameters are expected to 
be obtained through the learning of neural models. An AI 
evaporation decision mechanism for TP evaporation 
process is expected to be developed. This smart decision 
mechanism can not only help the junior technician to set 
the control parameters of evaporation process in advance, 
but also make the quality of TP film meet the customer’s 
request.  
 
In order to find a suitable neural model for the 
research we did, different neural models with different 
learning algorithms were tested.  
 
The estimations of transmittance of TP film were 
studied firstly. From the simulation results shown, it can 
be found obviously that a well-trained neural network 
indeed has the ability to estimate the transmittance 
accurately based on the proper input variables. In other 
words, the accurate transmittance of decoration film is 
possibly to be controlled before the evaporation process 
is started.  
 
The estimations of chromatic aberration (L.a.b. 
values) were studied secondly. Again, from the 
simulation results shown, it is obviously found that a 
well-trained neural network indeed has the ability to 
estimate the values of chromatic aberration. However, in 
our studies, the estimations of b value are not as good as 
what we expected. According to our analyses, it is 
because of the colors of TP films collected are all near 
the black or grey. The TP films we studied have no clear 
blue or yellow color. These films lack the characteristic 
of b value. Thus, in our future study, the TP film with 
large a and b values will be experimented and collected.
