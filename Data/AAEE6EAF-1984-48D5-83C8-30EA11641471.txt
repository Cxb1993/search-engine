Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel dispersion engineered 
ultrathin metal film coated on a tapered fiber with a thickness of around 10nm. To 
our knowledge, the dispersion characteristics of the proposed device induced by 
such an extremely thin metal film are described here for the first time. 
Experimental and simulation results indicate that the metal thin film has unique 
dispersion properties and intrinsic optical characteristics of strong absorption and 
high reflection in the near infrared light of a wavelength range of 1.25~1.65μm, 
making the material and waveguide dispersions of tapered-fibers more tailorable. In 
addition to the ability to flatten the slope of the fundamental-mode cutoff of the 
transmission spectrum, the dispersion profile is heavily influenced when the 
ultrathin metal film is coated around the proposed tapered fibers. The optical 
characteristics of the spectral response caused by the ultrathin film on tapered 
microfibers are also investigated and analyzed.  
Keywords: dispersion, fiber device, fiber grating, thin film coating.

Importantly, an ultra-thin Al film can form a special cutoff spectral response of FMC to be 
flattened over a broader wavelength range when the matched index liquid surrounds the 
device. Moreover, owing to the high reflectivity of a metal film, the higher-order mode 
short wavelengths might be well-confined to propagate in the fiber in order to create a 
novel filter for photonic device applications. Experimental and simulation results 
demonstrate the feasibility of such a novel micro device in facilitating the implementation 
of a highly effective dispersion engineering method for micro-fiber component 
applications. 
 
二、研究方法與成果:  
 
Tapered fiber was fabricated by a SMF-28 single mode fiber, in which the core and 
cladding are 8.2 μm and 125 μm in diameter, respectively, (Dco~8.2μm, Dcl~125μm) which 
was pulled and heated under autocontrol by LabVIEW with tapered equipment. This work 
focused on manufacturing a tapered fiber with an extremely uniform waist diameter and 
smoother tapered transitions length (τ), with the desired tapered length (L) and shape. 
Following tapering of the fiber until the diameter (D) of D= 30μm, aluminum (Al) ultrathin 
film was then coated around the surface of the tapered fiber with a thickness of around 
d=10nm by high vacuum evaporation with a deposition rate of 5 Å/sec. The thickness and 
deposition rate of the thin film were monitored by STM-100/MF Thickness/Rate Monitor 
with 1 Å thickness resolution. There are many advantages to use Al metal in this study, 
they include: easy to evaporate and always has good reflection in the infrared region, 
further with an additional advantage of adhering strongly to most substances. Furthermore, 
when compare with other metal materials, like Au (gold) and Ag (silver), Al has a vantage 
not generating the SPR efficiently since the main goal of the presented paper is to study the 
spectral transmission responses and cutoff characteristics of fundamental-mode field on the 
devices. There is an unattractive feature that it may form a thin and hard Aluminum oxide 
layer with about 1~2 nm on the 10~20nm Al films’ surface very quickly after coating [17]. 
Aluminum oxide film is a very low absorption dielectric material in wavelength range 
300nm~5μm and the thickness of Aluminum oxide is extremely thin which can be treated 
as a portion of the surrounding medium. Therefore we ignored the effect caused by the 
Aluminum oxide layer in the simulation work.

    The cutoff condition occurs when the normalized propagation constant b for 
fundamental-mode approaches zero, in which b is defined by the following equation [18]:

where effn  represents complex the effective index of a fundamental-mode for the proposed 
device that can be defined as IeffReffeff innn −=  , cn and sn are refractive indices of the new 
core of the tapered fiber and surrounding medium, respectively. This observation allows us 
to define FMC wavelength as the wavelength when seff nn →  appears. Figure 2 
schematically depicts the fundamental-mode field propagating in the waveguide taper. The 
fundamental mode in the uniform taper waist stretches through Al film and extends to the 
outer material. Electromagnetic wave propagating through an absorbing media can 
generally be expressed as [17]: 
( ))(exp)exp(0 LtiLEE βωα −⋅−=                     (2) 
where 0E  denotes maximal amplitude of the mode filed. Also, α attenuation coefficient 
which is defined as α= cnIeff⋅ω , Ieffn  can be regarded as decay rate that depends on 
extinction coefficient of the metal; L refers to the propagating length, ω the angular 
frequency, λ wavelength, and c represents the velocity of light in free space, β propagation 
constant is expressed as β=(2π/λ) Reffn⋅  , and t  represents the propagation time of the wave. 
Figure 3 shows the following refractive indices of the material dispersion profiles of 
original core: nco, silica cladding: ncl for the SMF-28 tapered fiber, optical liquid Cargille® 
index liquids with nD=1.456, 1.455, 1.454, and 1.452 and the coated metal material, 
aluminum (Al) used in the simulation. According to Fig. 3(b), refractive index (n) and 
extinction coefficient (k) of metal Al become increasingly large when the wavelength shifts 
to longer wavelength region revealing a high reflection and high absorption of optical 
characteristics. The material refractive index slopes are positive, which are opposite and 
different from the optical dielectric materials with negative slopes, as shown in Figs. 3(a) 
and (b)[19].

around a 2dB loss for the non-coated tapered fiber and around 5dB for the coated device in 
practical measurements when compared with those of theoretical simulation results. 
Simulated and experimental results seem to be agreements in the cutoff wavelengths and 
the curves of the optical spectra. According to the above results, the FMC slightly shifts to 
a shorter wavelength when the filter is coated around Al film, whereas the slope of FMC 
flattens after coating. This finding suggests that propagation constant (effective index) and 
propagation performance of electric or magnetic field of the optical wave are influenced 
and changed when the structural changes of the waveguide by coating such an ultrathin 
metal film. As for the intrinsic property for a negative dielectric constant of the metal, the 
proposed filter possesses a lower effective index, higher absorption loss in the transmission 
region (short wavelengths), flatter slope in the transition region and  higher reflection in 
the attenuation region (long wavelengths) than those of a non-coated device. Figure 4 (b) 
shows the diagram that defines the transmission, transition and attenuation regions in the 
optical spectra of the filter. The attenuation region is defined the spectral range which is 
under -30dB transmission. Above results demonstrate that the dispersion characteristics of 
waveguide can be engineered by the ultrathin metal film, which can strongly vary cutoff 
wavelengths and spectral response for such devices.

Owing to that the Al film is ultrathin, the evanescent field can penetrate through the film to 
reach the outer surrounding liquid but suffers from absorption in the metal thin film layer. 
According to Fig. 5(a), the tapered fiber without Al coating produces a clear short-pass 
steep cutoff, whereas a thicker Al film can flatten the cutoff curve in the transition region.

dispersion profiles of fundamental-mode in the UTMCTMF at different Al-coated 
thicknesses with a thin film length of L=1.5cm, where the Cargille®optical liquid is nD 
= 1.456. 
 
It is worth to mention that the transmission spectra in Fig. 5(a) seem to be very similar on 
the cases of thickness from 10-50nm because the thicknesses are so ultrathin and 
contributing the similar effects on the spectral response. On the other hand, the cutoff 
transmission spectra appear distortion and different if thickness greater than 100nm since 
fundamental-mode field suffered more absorption loss in transmission region and higher 
reflection in attenuation region. One can see again from the results of Fig. 5(b), the 
corresponding cutoff wavelengths are different for the cases of thickness 10, 30, and 50nm 
which are about 1.3207μm, 1.3160μm and 1.3051μm, respectively. That means the cutoff 
slopes in transition region are slightly getting flat when thickness increases. Despite the 
slightly different cutoff slopes, the transmission spectra are very similar on the cases of 
thickness from 10-50nm. Therefore, we can classify these thicknesses as the ultrathin 
layers for the proposed UTMCTMF devices since the thickness are very thin when 
  11
more loss in the attenuation band when the waist size is smaller. This phenomenon can also 
be demonstrated by the fundamental-mode field distribution from the literature [20]. If the 
diameter of non-coated tapered fiber ≤ 30μm (the cladding size), the fundamental-mode 
field is greatly extended into the surrounding region and subjected to a smoother cutoff 
slope. Especially with a size<10μm, the spectral response of the fundamental mode incurs 
a strong loss in the transmission region and the cutoff slope flattens much more. However, 
in the presented UTMCTMF filters, the spectral responses are nearly the same in the 
transition and attenuation regions when diameters are below 30μm due to the reflection 
phenomenon since the fundamental-mode field significantly spreads out and experiences 
the metal film directly. Even with diameters less than 10μm, the loss in the transmission 
region is significantly lower than with those in the non-coated tapered filters reported in 
the above mentioned paper [20].

Hybrid AG-FFPI/RLPFG for Simultaneously Sensing
Refractive Index and Temperature
Cheng-Ling Lee, Member, IEEE, Wen-Fung Liu, Zi-Yu Weng, and Fu-Chih Hu
Abstract—This work presents a novel, simple, and sensitive de-
vice for simultaneously sensing refractive index (RI) and temper-
ature ( ) of its surrounding environment. The sensing elements
are based on a hybrid air-gap fiber Fabry–Pérot interferometer
(AG-FFPI) with a reflective long-period fiber grating (RLPFG).
An air gap of around 10 m is formed in an Sn-overlaying process
on the fiber endface to make a fiber Fabry–Pérot interferometer
whose interferometric cavity is formed between the fiber endface
and the surface of the Sn metal. The proposed devices are char-
acterized by the simple fabrication and high sensitivity to both
and RI, which can be simultaneously measured. Additionally, the
proposed device can readily recognized the response from ambient
variations in or the RI.
Index Terms—Air-gap fiber Fabry–Pérot interferometer
(AG-FFPI), fiber-optics component, fiber sensors, long-period
fiber grating (LPFG).
I. INTRODUCTION
T HE simultaneous measuring, monitoring, or sensing ofmany parameters of a system is of scientific and tech-
nological importance. Various all-fiber interferometers that in-
corporate fiber gratings (FGs) have been developed with nu-
merous smart and hybrid structures for a wide range of potential
applications in bio-sensing, chemical sensing, and the sensing
of various other physical parameters. Various works have fo-
cused on enhancing measurement sensitivity and the simulta-
neous sensing of several parameters [1]–[9]. Because the LPFGs
are well known to be sensitive to the ambient variations, there-
fore most of the smart sensing schemes are based on the LPFGs;
for example, an LPFG may incorporates a fiber Bragg grating
(FBG) to support hybrid measurements schemes [1], [2]; and
a concatenated structure of the multiple LPFGs can support a
sensing method that is based on the cladding and core mode in-
terference mechanism [3]–[5]. Another configuration involves a
mirror that is coated on the endface of an LPFG and an intrinsic
AG-FFPI [6], while another involves an FBG that is incorpo-
rated into a low-finesse Fabry–Pérot interferometric cavity that
is formed by coating a monolayer material on the fiber endface

Fig. 1. Configuration of the hybrid AG-FFPI/RLPFG sensor.
[7]. In [6], Kim et al. firstly introduced a RLPFG that incorpo-
rated an AG-FFPI to measure simultaneously RI and . The air
gap inside the fiber was formed by hydrofluoric acid etching,
which was difficult to control and complicated to be imple-
mented. Similarly, a Fabry–Pérot cavity that is formed by using
the electrostatic self-assembled monolayer process for molec-
ular deposition to form a humidity-sensitive coating on the end
of a fiber would difficult to be fabricated [7].
In this Letter, we have presented a novel, simple, cost-effec-
tive and sensitive device for simultaneously sensing external RI
and . The sensing configuration is based on a hybrid AG-FFPI
with an integrated RLPFG. By skillfully overlay the metal Sn
over one endface of LPFG, an air gap can be formed between
the surface of the metal Sn and the end of the fiber. This gap
can be formed the Fabry–Pérot cavity. The proposed devices
have the advantages, such highly sensitivity for simultaneously
sensing both and RI. More importantly, it can readily capture
ambient variation in the surrounding or the RI.
II. SENSOR CONFIGURATION AND PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
This study presents for the first time a very simple, cost-effec-
tive fiber sensor whose structure is based on a RLPFG integrated
with an AG-FFPI made by the Sn-overlaying on one endface of
the RLPFG with a fiber arm of cm, forming a hybrid
air-gap fiber interferometer/reflective long-period fiber grating
(AG-FFPI/RLPFG) device is shown in Fig. 1. The interference
mechanism in the AG-FFPI is based on the two-beam interfer-
ence of the low-fineness air-gap Fabry–Pérot cavity [6]. Metal
Sn (Tin) can be easily processed because of its low melting
point (231.9 C) and it is also a good electrical/thermal con-
ductor. It is therefore extensively adopted in the electrical and
electronics industries. Therefore, in this work, when the fiber
endface was inserted into an extremely small drop of melting
Sn, an air gap was naturally formed between the fiber and the

is almost zero. The RLPFG is more sensitive because the
optical light propagates twice through the LPFG with longer
optical path difference, resulting in a small larger . Most
importantly, the proposed measured configuration can easily
determine the from the spectra that is caused by variations
of the or the .
The value both from the RLPFG and the AG-FFPI caused
by a change in or can be respectively estimated by using
the following equations.

where is the difference between the effective indices of
the core mode and the cladding mode. The coefficients , ,
and can be determined by measuring the dip responses of the
sensors with the variations in and . The corresponding
sensitivity from the matrix coefficients are about 0.275 nm C,
nm RIU within a linear range and
1.175 nm C, respectively. Therefore, the following equation,
(3), obtained by combining (1) and (2) enables the proposed
AG-FFPI/RLPFG to be used to measure the and simul-
taneously.
(3)
The sensitivity of 0.275 nm C of our RLPFG is 2~3$ times
greater than a correct estimation of the sensitivity for a TLPFG
nm C reported in [8]. It is because that the proposed
RLPFG is operated in the reflective mode with a very long prop-
agating cm which would increase the shifts [6]. It is
also verified by the cascaded (dual) LPFGs having greater sen-
sitivity [5]. The sensitivity of the of LPFG depends on the
cladding mode order and also varies with fiber types. An exact
estimate based on the coupled-mode theory [10] determined
the sensitivity of LPFG is about nm RIU within
and very similar to that of the RLPFG. Even
so, the total of RLPFG slightly greater than that of TLPFG
within the entire measurement with several nm. It is worth to
mention that the novel Sn-overlaying AG-FFPI incorporated in
the structure can greatly enhance the sensitivity and not be af-
fected by of the surrounding. By using an approach in [9],
the maximum errors for the measurements of the and are
respectively 1.56 C and 2.43 RIU and the rms errors are
respectively 1.33 C and 1.51 RIU for our sensor within
the ranges and C. The main
drawback of the sensor is an overlap of the wavelength dips can
occur, thus limits the measured range. From the experimental re-
sults, the range of the measurement of merely about 25–85 C
with high sensitivity of 1.175 nm C and the RI measurement
range with are achieved by the proposed sensor
under an identifiable shifts of the wavelength dips.
IV. CONCLUSION
This work demonstrated a new, cost-effective, simple and
sensitive hybrid structure, which was fabricated by incor-
porating an RLPFG with an AG-FFPI. Experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed sensor can simultaneously
measure the RI and the of the surroundings, corresponding
to the in the spectral response of the sensor to the change
in or RI can be easily identified. The sensitivity of the
hybrid AG-FFPI/ RLPFG is approximately 30 times greater
than that of the conventional silica-based TLPFG. This device
can provide the advantages of simplicity, easy fabrication, high
sensitivity, and has the capability to simultaneously measure
various physical parameters for applying in a wide range of
sensing systems.

taneously with a decrease in pressure. Bernoulli’s principle can
thus be applied to airflows using the following simple form:

mosphere atm torr Pa Pa N/m ; (m/s)

at room temperature; is surrounding pressure; and is

describe the relationship between and based on Bernoulli’s

the cross-sectional area of the cylindrical fiber arm (cladding

airflow increases and increases with a rising airflow velocity.
To further elucidate the optical properties of air related pressure,

air for various atmospheric pressures at 25 C. Variation in the
related to pressure change for the air is extremely small at
roughly torr. Thus, the interference fringe shift caused by
refractive index variation of the air can be ignored.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Operations of the proposed AG-FFPI sensor for various
airflow velocities are investigated by using samples with air
gaps of , 30, and 40 m to measure extremely weak
airflows. Fig. 4(a) shows the interference fringes shift to long
wavelengths as airflow velocity increases with the m
and cm. Inset in Fig. 4(a) shows the corresponding cen-
tral wavelength shifts for a dip around 1550 nm. The Fig. 4(a)
shows m since the results of the other air gaps have the
same sinusoidal curve spectra. Fig. 4(b) plots the corresponding
sensitivity and tuning efficiency. The best sensitive efficiency
is estimated at about nm m s with m.
The characteristics of the AG-FFPI can be modeled using the
two-beam optical interference theorem. For an intensity-based
interferometer, the visibility of the interference fringes depends
on the intensity of the two beams, and the equivalent intensities
of the two beams determine the best interference performance

fined as the Fresnel reflections by the first and second fiber/air
interfaces: , and , respectively. The optical phase difference
between the two beams OPD , where OPD
is the optical path difference. Therefore, the reflected intensity
in interference fringes can be easily expressed:

fringe with the following relation :

smaller air gap has a larger at the same airflow. The ratio
of the decides the wavelength dips shift. This means the
shorter air gap distance has smaller tolerance of the alignment
for two fibers. Estimations are in good agreement with experi-
mental results which are shown in Fig. 4(b) since a poor sensi-
tivity of the measured result is obtained when the increases.
The average fringe spacing and fringe visibility as a function
of the are shown in Fig. 4(c) at wavelength around 1550 nm.
The fringe spacing in this type of interferometers decreases ex-
ponentially with the increasing (dot). As the interference vis-
ibility (square) also decreases smoothly with the since longer

This investigation demonstrates leakage coupling between fundamental-mode and high-order mode resonance
based on a periodical silica thin-film long-period grating (TFLPG) that was coated on a tapered fiber when wave-
lengths longer than the fundamental-mode cutoff were propagated. For the leaky guiding situation, these leakage
modes still may exhibit strongmode coupling in the taper with the assistance of the TFLPGwhen the phase-matched
condition is satisfied. An extremely high tuning efficiency of 62:9 nm=°C, which is equivalent to a measurement of
sensitivity of approximately 168; 182 nm per refractive index unit, is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this
sensitivity is the highest achieved for a fiber sensor to date. © 2010 Optical Society of America

A tapered fiber waveguide device can be regarded as a
three-layer structure, and it has powerful applications
in many advanced technologies [1–10], because the arti-
ficial rearrangement of a waveguide structure in a single-
mode fiber taper has a modified and distinctive modal
characteristic, which may give it more flexible and attrac-
tive properties. Tapered fibers can be further fabricated
for novel, useful devices, such as sensitive sensors [1],
especially those of the supercontinuum generation [2],
long-period fiber grating (LPG) based on tapers [3–8],
and short-pass fiber filters [9]. Among them, LPG-based
filters using fiber tapers [3–8] differ critically from con-
ventional UV-induced LPGs. The coupling mechanism of
the latter is based on the core mode coupling to the co-
propagated cladding modes, whereas the coupling modes
in the tapers are all guided in the tapered core with a
strong overlapping between the intermodal coupled
modes, owing to the new artificial rearrangement of the
fiber structure [3–8]. A mechanically induced LPG on a
tapered fiber has been reported in [3]. Ding and Andrews
developed another means of managing the configuration
of a surface-corrugated LPG on a tapered fiber using con-
tact optical lithography and wet etching [4]. Kakarantzas
et al. elucidated two LPGs on tapered fibers formed by
the deposition of low-loss porous sol-gel-derived silica
films [5] and a periodic microtapering technique on a
CO2 laser beam [6]. The authors previously published
an investigation of a fiber taper with a side-contacted
metal grating that formed a taper-based LPG filter [7].
More recently, an important study of LPG fabricated by
a Ti:sapphire laser on a wavelength-scale microtaper has
been demonstrated [8]. However, the cited studies in-
volve a highly complicated fabrication process with
lower tunability and sensitivity to external variations be-
cause the mode-coupled mechanism of the above taper-
based LPGs are all based on the intermodal guided
modes coupling.
In this study, a silica thin-film long-period grating
(TFLPG) coated on a tapered fiber by high-vacuum rf-
magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. When the silica
thin film is coated through an amplitude mask, a surface
TFLPG can be formed on one side of the taper waist. In
general, the fundamental mode is strongly confined in the
taper and propagation along the taper is approximately
adiabatic; nevertheless, a fundamental-mode cutoff
(FMC) occurs when the tapered fiber is in an index-
matched surrounding. This condition produces a sharp
increase in spectral loss of the fundamental mode at
wavelengths that exceed the FMC, because the modes
are leaking out of the taper and not guiding anymore.
However, at propagation wavelengths that exceed the
FMC, the refractive index (RI) of the surroundings is
higher than the effective indices of the modes. These
leakage modes experience Fresnel reflection at the
cladding–surrounding interface and may exhibit strong
mode coupling in the taper with assistance of the TFLPG
if the phase-matched condition is satisfied.
The developed device is based on tapering a SMF-28
fiber with a diameter of 30 μm, which causes the corre-
sponding remaining core diameter to be less than
1:968 μm and enables the dopant germanium (Ge) in
the core to diffuse out into pure silica cladding by the ta-
pering processes [11]. After the fibers are tapered, the
TFLPG is coated using the high-vacuum rf-magnetron
sputtering techniquewith the same fabricated parameters
of [12]with the ratio ofO2=ðArþ O2Þ to be 5% andworking
pressure of ∼10−2 mbar for 1 h deposition at room tem-
perature. Figures 1(a) and1(b) showadiagramanda scan-
ning electron microscopic (SEM) micrograph of the
TFLPG on the taper, respectively. The figure displays
the fabricated TFLPG with a grating period of 200 μm.
The average thickness of the SiO2 thin-film grating is ap-
proximately 2 μm. Figure 2 presents the calculated effec-
tive index (solid curve) of the fundamental mode of the
30 μm tapered fiber in an index-matched liquid adopted
in this investigation. The solid curve crosses the RI of
the index-matched surroundings (dashed curve) at the
cutoff wavelength of about 1:32 μm, and the fundamental
mode cannot be guided in the taper beyond the FMC. In-
sets (a) and (b) in Fig. 2, respectively, show the calculated

strong leakage coupling in the attenuation region when
the taper is with the TFLPG. More favorable results were
obtained herein, because the TFLPG-based taper includes
a modified fiber waveguide structure, causing the mode
fields to interact directly with the surrounding liquid in
a leakage-guiding way that further enhances sensitivity.
Notably, in one study [15], the mode-coupling mechanism
in the proposed CO2-laser-ablated LPG with polymeric
surroundings still involves the coupling of the core mode
into the cladding modes, which may limit the improve-
ment in sensitivity. Figure 4 concerns another case with
the TFLPG with Λ ¼ 240 μm and L ¼ 1:5 cm; as ex-
pected, all of the resonance peaks shift to longer wave-
lengths in a linear manner within the corresponding
wavelength regions, yielding a best extinction ratio of
about 33 dB (at 24:5 °C). The coupling strength in this
case is higher than that obtained from the grating length
of L ¼ 1:2 cm because the longer length may enhance the
transmission dip. The inset in Fig. 4 plots the linear curves
fitted to the resonant shifts as the surroundings vary. The
slope 0:0629 μm=°C of peak 1 indicates an extremely high
tuning efficiency of 62:9 nm=°C (the RI sensitivity is
168,182 nm/RIU), which has excellent sensitivity because
of the resonant wavelength of peak 1 possessing the high-
est order mode coupling and very near FMC resonance.
In conclusion, a successive periodical silica TFLPG
coated on a tapered fiber by rf-magnetron sputtering
and observation of leakage modes coupling in the device
has been demonstrated experimentally for the first time
(to our knowledge). The leakage coupling between the
fundamental mode and high-order modes when light
wavelengths exceed the FMC can be used in making ul-
trasensitive measurements of variations in the surround-
ings. The novel coupling characteristics, extremely high
tuning efficiency, and excellent sensitivity may make the
device effective in fiber-based ultrasensitive sensors.

An analysis of optical properties of fundamental-mode in waveguide tapered ﬁbers is theoretically inves-
tigated and realized in this paper. The waveguide device is tapering an SMF-28 ﬁber to few tens of
micrometers of diameter. For discussing the cladding size of waveguide structure affects the fundamen-
tal-mode cutoff (FMC) and the optical characteristics of the devices, to etch outer cladding to reduce the
pure-silica cladding diameter proceeded and to compare optical properties of FMC with non-etched clad-
ding tapered ﬁbers. Numerical results show the cutoff wavelength of FMC is mainly dominated by the
size of squeezed core and slope of FMC could be inﬂuenced by the size of pure-silica cladding.

1. Introduction
There are many research works and applications have been
studied towards the optical characteristics of the tapered ﬁbers be-
cause they have great applications in different technologies such as
supercontinuum generation, pulse compression applications, use-
ful optical ﬁber components and sensitive sensors [1–6]. A tapered
waveguide must be regarded as a three-layer structure (core–clad-
ding and external medium). The transmission spectra of optical
characteristics are inﬂuenced by the refractive index of the exter-
nal medium, refractive index proﬁle of ﬁber and the tapered shape
of the device. The dispersion characteristics of the tapered ﬁber can
be easily modiﬁed by applying new optical materials such as opti-
cal liquids or optical polymers surrounding the tapered ﬁber.
When the mode ﬁelds of the guiding lights penetrate the pure-sil-
ica cladding deep enough to overlap the outer new materials, the
effective indices of guiding lights can be modulated and this is
called the material dispersion engineering [5]. An optimal tapered
ﬁber structure for a short-wavelength-pass ﬁlter with sharp and
high cutoff efﬁciency has been achieved and demonstrated [7].
However, characteristics of SMF-28 tapered ﬁber of fundamental-
mode cutoff (FMC) inﬂuenced by the waveguide structures (clad-
ding diameters) have not discussed in the published papers so
far. Therefore, in this paper, for the ﬁrst time, an analysis of optical
properties of fundamental-mode in waveguide tapered ﬁbers is
theoretically investigated and realized. The presented device is
based on SMF-28 tapered ﬁbers with few tens of micrometers of
pure-silica cladding diameter which plays as a new core after
tapering. To discuss the cladding size affects the fundamental-
mode cutoff and the optical characteristics (transmission spectra)
of the devices; the pure-silica cladding of the tapered ﬁbers are
etched to reduce different sizes and immersed in the same optical
liquid for comparing the waveguide properties.
2. Principle and tapered ﬁber structure
To investigate the inﬂuences of cladding size of the waveguide
structure to the fundamental-mode in tapered ﬁbers. Mode ﬁelds
should be extended and covered over the whole waveguide struc-
tures. The simplest way to expose the mode ﬁelds of guiding lights
is tapering technique and then modiﬁes the structure of the wave-
guide tapered devices; therefore, propagation constant: b of the
fundamental-mode will be changed. That means effective index
(neff = b/k, k is wave number: k = 2p/k), delay time: t (by differenti-
ating b with k) and chromatic dispersion (by differentiating t with
k) of the device are varied, as well as fundamental-mode cutoff
(FMC) and the optical characteristics of the tapered ﬁlters. The
studied tapered ﬁber ﬁlters are made by tapering standard sin-
gle-mode ﬁbers (SMF-28) with the original ratio of diameters of
core and cladding, Dco 8.2 lm and Dcl 125 lm, respectively. For
simpliﬁcation and practical considerations, three samples of ta-
pered ﬁbers with original cladding diameter Dcl of 50, 40, and
30 lm which means that corresponding remained-core size Dco is
about 3.28, 2.624, and 1.968 lm, respectively. In our simulation
study, we assume that germanium in the ﬁber core does not dif-
fuses out into pure-silica cladding through the tapering processes.
The tapered ﬁbers are all chemically etched using hydroﬂuoric acid
to remove part of silica cladding for reducing cladding diameter Dcl
and to compare the curves of FMC wavelengths, FMC slopes and
transmission losses with different waveguide structures of tapers.
Fig. 1 shows diagram of the structure for the proposed devices: (a)
before and (b) after etching with the original cladding diameter Dcl
of 50 lm and etched cladding diameter Dcl of 40 lmwith the iden-
tical core size.

where neff is effective index of fundamental-mode of the device, nc
and nD are refractive indices of the new core and surrounding for
the tapered ﬁber, respectively.
In the Eq. (2), b should be limited within 0 < b < 1 for the guided
mode and the cutoff condition is expressed as b? 0. In Fig. 3, the
cutoff wavelengths of the devices are not affected strongly because
mode ﬁeld would be conﬁned very well in the transmission wave-
length region when the cladding diameter Dcl is 50, 40 and 30 lm
because remained core of 3.28 lm is still large and dominants the
behavior of the fundamental guided mode.
In Fig. 3a, transmission wavelength region (around 1.45–
1.55 lm), fundamental-mode would not loss and transmission is
almost equal one. It can be clearly seen, when Dcl is 50 lm, the fun-
damental-mode ﬁeld would not stretch out more and not be af-
fected by external medium which will not resulted much loss in
wavelengths of stopband (around 1.55–1.65 lm). However, the
sharpest slopes of FMC is found when Dcl = 40 lm because in this
case the effective index of the fundamental-mode changes sud-
denly in the cutoff wavelength by which a high rejection efﬁciency
can be readily obtained. One can see Fig. 3b for more clearly and
can ﬁnd the cutoff wavelengths are almost the same when clad-
ding sizes are 50, 40 and 30 lm while cutoff wavelength of
10 lm cladding is longer than those of 20 lm cladding. The results
can be explained by the calculated effective index of the tapered ﬁ-
bers with the same remained core while silica cladding sizes are
different which is shown in Fig. 3c. In Fig. 3c, cross points (cutoff
wavelengths) of neff and nD (external medium) proﬁles tend very
slightly toward longer wavelength when cladding sizes reduced
by etching, especially under Dcl < 30 lm. The neff proﬁle tends to
lower and ﬂatter when Dcl reduces. It is because that the tapered
cladding plays the role of the new core and the fundamental-mode
ﬁeld spreads out into non-dispersive external medium more when
the diameter of tapered cladding decreases. When original clad-
ding size of tapered ﬁber are Dcl = 40 and 50 lm, the fundamen-
tal-mode ﬁeld is conﬁned in the new core very well and the
properties of transmission spectra of the both cases are similar
which are different with those cladding sizes are etched – 30, 20
and 10 lm. It also can be demonstrated by the mode ﬁeld distribu-
tion from the published paper [7], if the diameter of tapered ﬁber
<33 lm (the cladding size), the fundamental-mode ﬁeld will be
strongly extended into surrounding region and subjected a
smoother cutoff slope of the transmission spectra due to the effec-
tive index of fundamental-mode is getting ﬂat since optical liquid
is non-dispersive than silica which are shown in Fig. 2. But in the
cases of cladding sizes 50 and 40 lmwhich are shown in blue-solid
and green-dashed lines in Fig. 3c, respectively; mode are conﬁned
well in short wavelengths with higher effective index while shar-
ply changed in the cutoff condition and suffers large loss at rejec-
tion band. Therefore, high rejection efﬁciency at the cutoff
wavelengths can be obtained on these two cases. It is worth to
know, effective index slopes (cross angle between effective index
and surrounding) will strongly affect the slopes of FMC. From the
above results, a high effective index slope (large cross angle) will
make a sharp slope of FMC because it is caused by a rapid variation
of effective index within narrow wavelength range. Again, Fig. 4
shows the original tapered size of the cladding is 40 lm with re-
mained-core size is reduced to be 2.624 lm. From Fig. 4a and b,
one can see the optical properties of FMC are very similar with

a tapered fiber side contacted with a metal grating is proposed
and demonstrated in this paper. The temperature/index tuning
sensitivity can be enhanced, and the unusual spectral response of
decreasing phase-matching wavelength with respect to increasing
grating period and temperature is observed.

I. INTRODUCTION
L ONG-PERIOD FIBER GRATINGS (LPFGs) with artifi-cial waveguiding structures or material constituents may
possess larger wavelength tunability for sensing applications,
and may have more functionalities than conventional LPFGs
[1]–[10]. Conventional LPFGs are made by introducing periodic
index changes in the fiber core to couple the core mode with
cladding modes at discrete wavelengths [11]–[13]. In sensing
applications, the conventional LPFGs have limited wavelength
sensitivity of temperature and refractive index due to the tight
mode-field confinement. Numerous kinds of LPFGs have been
proposed to enhance the sensitivity, including the use of short-
grating period [9], ultrathin cladding layer [10], asymmetric
CO laser ablation [3]–[5], and surface-corrugated fibers [6].
Among them, the fiber constituents with high thermo-optic co-
efficients and the strong overlap among the core mode, cladding
modes, and the external medium are the most crucial factors to
the tuning efficiency of the LPFG resonance wavelengths.

Since the conventional LPFGs have limited sensing ability
due to the tight mode-field confinement, to enhance the sen-
sitivity of the LPFGs, the tapered fiber is a good candidate
to cause the field of the high-order modes more extend into
the external medium. The strong interaction of the optical
evanescent field with the environment can produce highly
wavelength-dependent index sensing sensitivity between the
fundamental mode and high-order modes, which, in turn,
affects the phase-matching wavelengths and mode-coupling
characteristics. The device is thus more sensitive to the index
variation of the external medium. The slimmed down fiber
with cylindrical symmetric surface-corrugated LPFGs had
been proposed [6]. However, the dispersion-related sensing
capability as well as the tuning response of the LPFGs based
on slimmed down fibers have not been well investigated yet.
In our previous work, high-efficiency, wideband-tunable,
asymmetric laser-ablated long-period fiber gratings that use an
optical polymer overlay was demonstrated [5]. However, in the
viewpoint of using artificial waveguide structure to generate
evanescent wave, which can enhance the sensitivity with the
environmental change, tapered fibers can be further considered
to be applied in our previous asymmetric LPFG structure. This
is the motivation of this paper.
In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a new LPFG
structure based on a tapered fiber with a side-contacted metal
grating to form a flexible and highly sensitive sensor. The pro-
posed LPFG is composed of a fiber taper with a uniform waist
and a side-contacted metal grating that provides an enhanced,
but opposite dip wavelength tuning tendency with respect to the
grating period and temperature change when compared to con-
ventional LPFGs. The unusual temperature and refractive index
tuning characteristics of the proposed LPFGs attribute to the
unique material and waveguide dispersion characteristics of the
proposed novel structure.
II. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS
A. Mode Analysis of Tapered Fibers
Fig. 1(a) depicts the studied tapered fiber structure. The di-
ameter D of the uniform waist is a few tens of micrometers and
the length is approximately 1 cm, and the transition zone has an
exponential shape ranging from 125 m to D with the transition
length around 1.75 cm. The evanescent waves spread out of the
fiber and reach the external environment when the single-mode
optical fiber is tapered down to a few tens of micrometers in di-
ameter. The pure-silica cladding now plays as a new waveguide,

Equations (8)–(15) resulted from the continuity of ,
and give rise to the guidance conditions for the wave-
guide modes. Since the eight equations are a set of homogeneous
linear equations, the determinant of the coefficient matrix has to
be zero in order to have nonzero solutions. This condition is the
final characteristic equation for determining the dispersion rela-
tion of the modes.
B. Phase-Matching Wavelength Analysis for LPFG With
Side-Contacted Metal Grating Structure
An LPFG based on a tapered fiber with a side-contacted
metal grating is shown in Fig. 1(c). A uniform taper waist
around 20- m diameter is achieved by tapering down a stan-
dard single-mode fiber (Corning SMF-28). The details of
fabrication process have been addressed in our previous works
[15]–[17]. The length of the uniform waist is around 1 cm, and
the length of the taper transition region is approximately 1.75
cm. A 1-D thin-aluminum-layer grating of total length about
1 cm is side contacted with the taper fiber waist. The metal
grating is put on a thermoelectric cooler (TE cooler) to control
the temperature of the LPFG. The 20- m-diameter waveguide
can support many propagation modes as the V value is around
100. As the light source is launched in, the fundamental mode
propagated along SMF-28 is adiabatically converted to the
fundamental mode that propagates along the fiber taper. Mode
coupling occurs in the metal grating contact region when the
phase-matching condition is satisfied. The coupled high-order
modes will escape totally after the second taper region, and
thus, the attenuation dips in the transmission spectrum are
produced.
The effective index of the fiber mode is denoted as
. Here, denotes the angular order and denotes
the th root of the modal characteristic equation solved from
(8)–(15). In this way, is the effective index of the
fundamental mode. Fig. 2(a)–(c) displays the effective index
difference as functions of the wavelength
for , 20, and 30 m, respectively. The fiber is assumed
to be surrounded by air. The index difference between the air
and the pure silica is so high that the mode field diameters of the
cladding mode shrink to be well confined in the fiber for large
D. For the same pair of coupled modes, the
increases with decreasing taper diameter. This is because high
fraction of the fields for the higher order modes leak more in
the air for smaller D. To analyze the mode coupling effects in
the studied LPFGs, the refractive index difference between the
fundamental mode and seven high-order modes are solved and
plotted in Fig. 2(a)–(d). The phase-matching condition can be
expressed in terms of the intermodal dispersion function
defined by
(16)
where and are effective indexes of the two coupled
modes, is the phase-matching wavelength to be determined,
and is the grating period. The phase-matching wavelengths
can be determined graphically as the intersections of the in-
termodal dispersion function with the grating spatial frequency
. However, since the proposed asymmetric LPFG struc-
ture, as shown in Fig. 4, should somehow affect the symmetric
mode shapes of the taper fibers, the actual intermodal dispersion
may be slightly different for practical devices.
As aforementioned, the crossed points of the
curve and the constant curve denote the
phase-matching wavelengths at a specific grating period.
Fig. 2(d) shows the for m and the
fiber is now assumed to be surrounded by the optical liquids
(Cargille index-matching liquids with the index ).
The mode fields now highly spread out of the optical fiber
waist when propagate in the taper surrounded by the optical
liquids due to the small index difference. This causes smaller
compared to that shown in Fig. 2(b). For the
grating period around 200–500 m, the
is from to at m. As can be
seen in Fig. 2(b), the waist diameter of m is suitable
for lower order mode coupling at the given metal grating
period (200–500 m) in this paper. For illustration purposes,
to compare the influence of taper waist diameter on intermodal
coupling, Fig. 3(a) plots the intermodal dispersion of coupled
modes between and for different taper diameters. The
value of increases with decreasing waist
diameter, and the slope of intermodal dispersion of coupled
modes becomes steeper for smaller waist diameters. Figs. 2
and 3 show that the resonance wavelength should be highly
sensitive to the grating period change at a larger waist diameter
for lower order mode coupling.
Again, for illustration purposes, Fig. 3(b) plots the –
intermodal dispersion for the untapered SMF-28 fiber sur-
rounded by the air as well as for the tapered fibers with different
surrounding media. It has been known that there are two
types of LPFGs: one is the positive linear-dispersion grating
, and the other is the negative linear-disper-
sion grating . The conventional LPFGs with
periodic index changes along the fiber core of the standard
single-mode fiber are positive linear-dispersion gratings, while
the proposed LPFGs shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d) are negative
linear-dispersion gratings. The SMF-28 has steeper slope of
than the tapered fiber does, as shown
in Fig. 3(b), indicating that the phase-matching wavelengths
of conventional LPFGs is less sensitive than that of proposed

tendency with respect to the grating period and temperature.
These will be verified experimentally in the following section.
C. Measurement Results and Sensing Capability
Fig. 4 plots the experimental spectral responses of the pro-
posed LPFGs under different grating periods at m
in the air at room temperature. As the grating period increases,
the phase-matching wavelength decreases. Therefore, the pro-
posed LPFG structure possesses opposite dip wavelength tuning
tendency with respect to the period change when compared to
conventional LPFGs. This experimental observation agrees with
the theoretical analysis revealed in the previous section. How-
ever, the predicted phase-matching wavelengths (the cross point
of with ) shown in Fig. 2(b) may be different from
the actual transmission dip wavelengths of the experimental data
shown in Fig. 4. This is because the proposed side-contacted
grating structure is different from the simulated symmetric ta-
pered fiber structure, and thus, the mode profiles and effective
indexes of modes may be slightly different from the solutions
of (8)–(15). However, the predicted tuning tendency should not
be affected by these uncertainties, as have been verified by the
experimental data.
Fig. 5 shows the experimental transmission spectra of the
LPFGs surrounded by the air with different separations from
the metal grating to the tapered fiber waist with m
and grating m at room temperature. The marked
lines labeled from to respectively, indicate the five
cases of different distance change from the metal grating to the
taper waist. The distance change is around 0.2 mm at each step,
as shown in Fig. 5 (inset). When the waist of the tapered fiber
moves closely to the metal grating, the phase-matching wave-
length will shift to long wavelengths and the dip depth changes
as well. The wavelength shift and dip depth change may be due
to the change of the effective indexes difference between the two
coupling modes, indicating that the effective indexes of the asso-
ciated modes are modified because larger portion of the evanes-
cent waves now interact with the metal grating when the tapered
fiber moves more closely to the metal grating.
The experimental transmission spectra of the LPFG device at
room temperature in the air with the metal grating pitch of 426
Fig. 6. Experimental transmission spectra of the LPFG device at room temper-
ature in the air, water, and alcohol with the metal grating pitch of 426 m.
m is shown in Fig. 6. When the water and alcohol are applied to
cover the uniform waist section of the LPFGs, the two adjacent
transmission dips gradually grow up and shift to longer wave-
lengths, as also shown in Fig. 6. Note that with the refractive
index of the environmental material increases from water
to alcohol , the transmission dips apparently
shift to longer wavelengths. These experimental results again
are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis revealed in
the previous section. Compare to the LPFG devices with the
same surrounding medium reported in [4], our proposed LPFGs
not only have more superior index sensing characteristics, but
also have opposite wavelength shift tendency with respect to
the increasing refractive index of the surrounding medium. The
modes will spread more out of the taper region when the LPFGs
are surrounded by the optical liquids instead of the air. There-
fore, the overlap among the fundamental mode, higher order
modes, and the grating is improved when the LPFGs are sur-
rounded by the optical liquids. In this way, the transmission dip
depth is increased due to stronger coupling. The environmental
sensitivity of the phase-matching wavelengths is also enhanced
in these cases.
To investigate the spectral responses of the LPFG at different
heating temperatures, a metal grating with period of 217 m
is employed with the tapered fiber diameter m. The
applied temperature T ranges from 25 C to 75 C, and the spec-
tral responses are shown in Fig. 7. The phase-matching wave-
length moves to the short wavelength side and the peak attenu-
ation gradually increased with increasing T. The grating pitch
increases with increasing T for conventional LPFGs, and the
phase-matching wavelength is changed to longer wavelengths
at higher environmental temperature. In this conventional LPFG
case, the tuning efficiency substantially depends on the thermal
expansion coefficient of the fiber material. However, our pro-
posed LPFGs have decreasing resonance wavelength with re-
spect to the increasing temperature, and the average tempera-
ture tuning efficiency is estimated to be about nm/ C,
which is greatly improved when compared to that of conven-
tional LPFGs ( nm/ C [13]). The opposite temperature
tuning tendency of the attenuation dip wavelength of the pro-
posed LPFGs is due to the dispersion-engineered waveguiding
HSU et al.: SPECTRAL RESPONSE OF LONG-PERIOD FIBER GRATING 1063
with the environment, which, in turn, directly affects the
mode-coupling characteristics. In particular, the unusual spec-
tral response of decreasing phase-matching wavelength with
respect to the increasing grating period and temperature has
been experimentally observed and theoretically analyzed. The
temperature/index tuning sensitivity can be enhanced by suit-
ably engineering the waveguide dispersion through tapering
and employing suitable external materials.

3. Results and Discussion 
Transmission spectrum readouts are directly obtained from the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA). Figure 4(a) 
and (b) show the spectra of the proposed interferometers in guided and leaky conditions, respectively. Insets 
display the corresponding wavelength shift sensitivity of the two cases. In the Fig. 4(a), in the guided multimode 
case (n3<nsi), wavelength shift () of the destructive interference dip is higher sensitive with the RI of the 
surrounding n3. Even most high order modes are experienced by the ITR on the boundary of NCF and the 
surrounding where a change in the SI of the surrounding results in a change in that induces the  in the optical 
spectra but still having a high loss caused by the much more evanescent wave stretching into the ambient. For 
another case of the high order modes no longer experiences the ITR, and thus the operation of the devices is 
significantly different with that of results shown in Fig. 4(b). This situation can be referred to as a leaky-guided 
mode waveguide condition. The propagation of the leaky-guided modes has a notable feature which is when the 
n3 is slightly greater than nsi, the Fresnel reflected power of the interference high order mode is nearly 
disappeared since a great loss resulting a poor interference fringe visibility. However, if the n3 is adequately 
greater than the nsi, a high Fresnel reflection for the high order modes to generate a higher extinction ratio is 
achieved. Since the interference mechanism is based on the propagated core mode interfere with the high order 
modes due to the existing optical path difference (OPD). Thus the interference condition for the device can be

Abstract-This work presents a novel, simple and 
sensitive device based on a hybrid air-gap fiber 
Fabry-Perot interferometer with a reflective-long-period 
fiber grating (AG-FFPIIRLPG). Results show the 
sensitivity is almost 30 times than that of LPGs. 
1. Introduction 
The simultaneous measuring, monitoring, or sensing of many 
parameters of a system is of scientific and technological 
importance. Various all-fiber interferometers that incorporate 
fiber gratings (FGs) have been developed with numerous smart 
and hybrid structures for a wide range of potential applications 
in bio-sensing, chemical sensing, and the sensing of various 
other physical parameters. Various works have focused on 
enhancing measurement sensitivity and the simultaneous 
sensing of several parameters. Because the long-period fiber 
gratings (LPGs) are well known to be sensitive to the ambient 
variations, therefore most of the smart sensing schemes are 
based on the LPGs [1-5]. A configuration involves a mirror 
that is coated on the endface of an LPG and an intrinsic air gap 
fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (AG-FFPI) [4], while another 
involves an FBG that is incorporated into a low-finesse 
Fabry-Perot interferometric cavity that is formed by coating a 
monolayer material on the fiber endface [5]. In [4], Kim et a1. 
firstly introduced a reflective LPG (RLPG) that incorporated 
an air gap fiber interferometer (AG-FFPI) to measure 
simultaneously refractive index and temperature. The air gap 
inside the fiber was formed by hydrofluoric acid etching, 
which was difficult to control and complicated to be 
implemented. Similarly, a Fabry-Perot cavity that is formed by 
using the electrostatic self-assembled monolayer process for 
molecular deposition to form a humidity- sensitive coating on 
the end of a fiber, is difficult to be fabricated [5]. In this paper, 
we have presented a novel, simple, cost- effective and 
sensitive device for simultaneously sensing external refractive 
index and temperature. The sensing configuration, AG-FFPII 
RLPG is based on a hybrid AG-FFPI with an integrated RLPG. 
By skillfully overlay the metal Sn over one endface of LPG, an 
air gap of about 10/-!m can be formed between the surface of 
the metal Sn and the end of the fiber. This gap can be formed 
the F-P cavity. The proposed devices have the advantages, 
such as very simple, cost- effective and highly sensitivity for 
sensing the surrounding temperature.

2. Experiment 
This study presents for the first time a very simple, 
ultra-compact, cost-effective fiber sensor whose structure is 
based on a RLPG integrated with an AG-FFPI made by the 
Sn-overlaying on one endface of the RLPG, forming a hybrid 
air-gap fiber interferometer/reflective long-period fiber 
grating (AG-FFPIIRLPG) device (Fig. 1). When the fiber 
endface was inserted into an extremely small drop of melting 
Sn, an air gap was naturally formed between the fiber and the 
metal Sn owing to the cohesion of the bulk Sn. The metal Sn 
(Tin) can be easily processed because of its low melting point 
(231.9°C) and it is also a good electricallthermal conductor. 
Thus the interference mechanism in the AG-FFPI of the sensor 
is based on the low-fineness air-gap Fabry-Perot cavity. The 
reflection spectra of an RLPG with a grating period of 300/-!m 
and grating length of 1 cm and the interference fringes that are 
generated by the AG-FFPI of a single mode fiber (SMF) are 
first measured using an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA), and 
displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2 (b), respectively. From Fig. 2(a) 
the loss of the RLPG is high, approximately 15dB, since the 
endface of the interface surfaces with Fresnel reflection is 
merely R�O.034. As shown in Fig. 2(b), a sinusoidal spectrum 
of the interference fringes caused by an air gap of about 10/-!m 
was obtained. In Fig. 2(b), the loss from an SMF fiber endface 
that is overlaying with Sn is smaller, averaging about 8.5dB, 
owing to the reflection (R�O.5) from the Sn metal is increased. 
The reflection spectrum with a maximum extinction ratio of 
around 9dB can be obtained from the proposed AG-FFPI 
configuration. The two above structures can be combined to 
realize hybrid AG-FFPI/RLPG sensor and obtain the optical

Abstract-This study investigates an ultracom pact, 
and simple, reflective air-gap fiber Fabry-Perot 
interferometer (RAGFFPI) which is based on a 
polymer filled hollow core fiber endface. Temperature 
sensitivity of +8.226nmfoC is achieved by the proposed 
RAGFFPI. 
1. Introduction 
Varieties of in-line fiber interferometers (FIs) have been 
proposed with many smart and hybrid structures to 
manage the wide fields of practical applications on bio­
sensing, chemical-sensing and various physical sensing. 
Among these parametric sensing, enhancement of 
sensitivity for temperature sensing based on the silica­
based FI is generally restricted due to the extremely low 
thermal expansion coefficient of silica. These FIs for 
temperature sensing can be based on long-period fiber 
gratings (LPG) [1], micro fiber tips [2], tapered fibers, 
side-polished fibers [3], several configuration of Fabry­
Perot [4-5] and Mach-Zehnder type fiber interferometers 
[6]. However, the cited studies on the fiber-based 
interferometers involve a highly complicated fabrication 
processes and insensitivity to external temperature 
variations due to extremely low thermal expansion 
coefficient (�5 x I 0-7°C 1) of silica-based fiber. 
In this study, for the first time, we present a very simple, 
ultracompact and highly sensitive retlective air gap fiber 
Fabry-Perot interferometer (RAGFFPI) for the 
temperature sensing application. The proposed sensor are 
composed a single mode fiber (SMF) splice a section of 
hollow-cored fiber (HCF) with length of several hundreds 
of micrometer. The endface of HCF is filled with a section 
of the monomer and remained an air gap between SMF 
and polymer (shown in Fig.I). The monomer, Norland 
Optical Adhesive 65 (NOA65) is some kind of photo­
polymerizable liquid which can be cured by ultraviolet 
(UV) light with a maximum absorption within the range of 
350-380nm. The monomer can be formed as a solid 
structure of polymer through the UV exposing process. 
The solid edge of the polymer network can fix the air-gap 
structure of the device as well as maintaining the gap 
distance. Figure I(a) shows the diagram of the proposed 
RAGFFPI device. Experimental results show the present 
devices with high temperature sensitivity of +8.226 nmfOC 
and having specific features such that the quite easy 
fabrication and rapid, in addition to having preferable 
79 
characteristics of miniaturization are achieved.

2. Experiment 
In experiment, a single mode fiber (SMF) firstly spliced a 
length of about llOflm HCF by using a special fusion 
technique. Then, a monomer NOA65 was filled into 
endface of diameter D=50flm HCF with a filled length of 
about 60flm by utilizing the capillary process. Thus, 
through the process, an empty length with full air left in 
the front section of the HCF. The filled length of the 
monomer NOA65 can be experienced in controlling by the 
time of the capillary process. After that, the endface of 
HCF was cured by an UV light with low exposure 
• . 2 mtenslty around 5m W fcm for 2hr at room temperature. 
Through the curing process, monomer NOA65 is 
gradually transformed into solid polymer from a refractive 
index range of 1.515 (monomer with before UV -curing) to 
1.524 (polymer with total UV -curing), the polymer 
NOA65 of solid walls were established and one wall can 
be as the mirror of the Fabry-Perot (FP) interferomtric 
cavity. The retlective interference fringes of the 
interferometer are measured experimentally by optical 
spectrum analyzer (OSA) and further applied on the 
sensing of the surrounding temperature. 
3. Results and Discussion 
To demonstrate the temperature sensing performance of 
the proposed RAGFFPI, the device is placed on a TE 
cooler inside a closed space with the temperature T (0C) 
increased from 19°C to 25.5°C. Figure 2 shows the 
reflection spectra of the RAGFFPI with air-gap length: L 
50flm. The Fig.2 demonstrates that a quasi-sinusoidal 
interference pattern over a wide range of wavelengths can 
be obtained and the interference dip shifts from varing 
temperature is greatly significant. The presented

Abstract-This study demonstrates a novel and sensitive 
airflow sensor based on a reflective tapered fiber 
interferometer (RTFI). Interference fringes shifts of the 
RTFI from bending effect by the airflow are effectively 
detected and experimentally investigated. 
1. Introduction 
Airflow detection is very important in various applications, 
including mechanical, electronic, biotechnology, chemical 
and medical applications. Measurement principles are based 
on mechanical [1] and electronic systems [2] micro-electro­
mechanical systems (MEMSs) [3] and the fiber-optics 
techniques [4-5]. Especially, in [4], light input an etched 
thinned fiber-tip cantilever reduced optical coupling to a 
receiving multi-mode fiber when fluidic drag force acts on the 
fiber-tip to make a displacement of the emitting light from the 
fiber. The above sensor alignment needs guided by the 
preformed microfluidic channels, and even fabricated by 
chemical etched process. The other type of fiber-based sensors 
for fluid sensing based on the well known optical fiber Bragg 
grating (FBG) [5] are sensitive and non-electrical operation. 
When the force created by the fluid affects a couple of FBGs 
to make FBGs bending or distortion with the strain acting. The 
measured mechanism is simple and sensitive but needs 
temperature compensation since FBG is very sensitive with 
the ambient temperature. The above sensors are quite practical 
but required more complicated and integrated fabrication for 
sensing the fluid, airflow or pressure. 
This paper presents a novel, sensitive and simplified optical 
sensor that determines airflows accurately and efficiently. The 
proposed sensor is based on a reflective tapered fiber 
interferometer (RTFI) whose contains a tapered region near 
the endface a single mode fiber (SMF). When one point of an 
SMF was heated by an arc technique, cladding diameter can be 
stretched to a specific thin size. The microstructure can be 
formed similarly as a tapered fiber Michelson interferometer 
[6]. When a micro airflow flows vertically through the 
proposed tapered interferometer sensor, an acting force result 
in the sensor bending and makes the interference fringes shift. 
The experimental setup and the operation of the proposed 
sensor for the measurement of the airflows are shown in Fig.l. 
Here, L is fiber arm of the sensor, d is taper diameter, e is the 
taper length and z is the distance between the central tapered 
point and fiber endface.

2. Experiment and Measured Principle 
In experiment, electrical arc method has been adopted in this 
study to fabricate a taper in an SMF fiber (SMF-28, Corning 
Inc.). We simply fabricate the fiber taper by using an Ericsson 
FSU-975 commercial fusion splicer. A section of SMF-28 was 
stretched and the middle region was heated by arc from the 
two electrodes inside the fusion splicer. With an appropriate 
arc power, arc duration, and stretching distance, the diameter 
of the fiber cladding was sharpened to a waist diameter d of 
several micrometer with the taper length of e. Figure 2(a), (b)

fiber, respectively.

Abstract- A novel broadband, modal and polarization-
selective evanescent-field coupling in an elliptical-cored long-
period fiber grating (ECLPFG) based filtering coupler has 
been presented in this paper. The modal characteristics and 
splitting of even and odd modes in the elliptical core fiber 
(ECF) have been analytically calculated in this study. By 
dispersion control on the proposed ECLPFG-assisted mode 
coupler, phase matching condition occurs in the turn-around-
point (TAP) can be achieved which enables broadband 
resonance and modal selectivity.

I. INTRODUCTION                               
Fiber coupler filters have been used as not only power 
splitter and wavelength multiplexer but also spectral filters, 
switches, and polarization beam splitters [1]. An ideal 
mode coupler with wide filtering bandwidth, wide tuning 
range, superior environment stability, and cost-effective 
characteristic will be very practical in many applications. 
In recent years, a new class of fiber couplers has emerged 
that is based on parallel long-period fiber gratings (LPFGs) 
[2–6]. The LPFG couplers can easily be designed to 
operate at selective wavelengths and are particularly 
suitable for application in coarse wavelength-division-
multiplexed systems. The configuration of two parallel 
LPFGs can be considered as a grating-assisted directional 
coupler. However, the inherent bandwidth of the resonance 
peaks of long-period fiber grating (LPFG)-based filter are 
narrow, at about several nm, because the phase-matching 
condition between the two optical modes is satisfied at 
only a specific resonant wavelength.  Indeed, this is the 
major drawback of the bandwidth-versus-coupling strength 
trade-offs for practical applications when using such a 
narrow-band LPFG device. S. Ramachandran et al. 
demonstrated a broadband, spectrally flat LPFG-based 
broadband mode conversion in an especially designed few-
mode fiber that was designed to have two coupled modes 
with identical group velocities in the desired spectral range 
of wavelength [7]. The reported LPFG coupling in this 
condition can achieve a broadband mode conversion 
because it occurs in the turn-around-point (TAP) between 
the fundamental mode and a specific higher-order guided 
core mode. Further TAP applications, S. Ramachandran 
also demonstrated a spectrally flat LPFG-based polarizer 
by especially designing a birefringent fiber with two 
identical group velocities for the two coupled modes [8]. 
The high polarization extinction ratio (PER) LPFG-based 
polarizers have been demonstrated by mechanically 
induced polarization dependent loss, but limited to a 
narrowband response [9], and a photonic-crystal-fiber 
LPFG polarizer is feasible with a broad bandwidth but 
difficult to fabricate [10]. To satisfy the above 
requirements simultaneously, special designed fibers are 
needed. Therefore, in this study, we present a novel, 
spectral flat-top, ultra broadband, modal selectivity and 
polarization-selective filter which is based on an elliptical-
core long-period fiber grating (ECLPFG)-based coupler. 
By arranging the material dispersion of the fiber, the phase 
matching condition of the LPFG device occurs in the turn-
around-point (TAP) can be achieved. 
 
II. ELLIPTICAL-CORE BASED LPG 
Many research interests have been reported to calculate the 
modal behavior of elliptical core step index optical fibers 
[11]. The modal characteristics and splitting of even and 
odd modes in the elliptical core fiber (ECF) have become 
the most important applications in polarization fiber optics. 
Different from the well-known solutions in a cylindrical-
symmetry standard single mode fiber, the most suitable 
bases for the electromagnetic waves propagating in the 
elliptical-cylindrical coordinates, ξ (radial) and η 
(azimuthal) are Mathieu functions [12]. Followed by the 
standard approach and with the weakly guiding 
approximation, the refractive index difference between the 
core and cladding is very small, the longitudinal 
components Ez and Hz become very small when compared 
with the transverse components; therefore the modes are 
nearly transverse (LP mode). The characteristic equations 
for the linearly polarized (LP) guided modes inside the 
core can be derived as [11]:

IV. CONCLUSION 
We have demonstrated and analyzed the broadband, modal 
and polarization-selective evanescent-field coupling in an 
elliptical-cored long-period fiber grating (ECLPFG) based 
coupler filter. The modal characteristics and splitting of 
even and odd modes in the elliptical core fiber (ECF) have 
been calculated and analyzed. By dispersion control on the 
proposed ECLPFG-assisted mode coupler, the phase 
matching condition occurs in the turn-around-point (TAP) 
can be successfully achieved which enables broadband 
resonance and modal selectivity. The component could 
also serve as a broadband high-isolation (de)multiplexers, 
bandpass/ stop filters and high extinction ratio fiber 
polarizer.

for the first five cladding modes to match the results of 
experiments are shown. One can see just a general 
agreement is achieved due to the unstable of the liquid 
perturbation. Therefore, packaged the device must be 
accomplished for the stability of the measurement. Fig.4 
shows the lower order mode resonant peaks shift with 
different temperatures in the air. Results show the 
proposed AI-LPG have decreasing resonance wavelength 
with respect to the increasing temperature, and the 
average temperature tuning efficiency is almost linear and 
estimated to be about -0.42nm/qC (see inserted figure). 
The tuning property with negative tuning efficient and 
with higher sensitivity of the presented device which is 
very different when compared with the results of general 
AI-LPG’s (about +0.058~0.070nm/qC [2-3]). The 
unusual resonant characteristic is attributed to the silica-
based fiber core and cladding with different dispersion 
index profile from that of the non-dispersive optical 
liquid. Naturally, silica fiber has a very high phonon 
energy (~ 1100 cm-1), which makes silica become more 
dispersive than other optical materials. From the 
preliminary results, the hollow core LPG may be further 
filled with other liquid or mixture for the more practical 
interests on chemical and biochemical fiber-optic sensing. 
IV.  CONCLUSIONS
A liquid core arc-induced long-period fiber grating (AI-
LPG) is fabricated and demonstrated for the first time. 
Reversed temperature sensing property due to the 
different dispersive characteristics of the optical liquid 
and silica based fiber can be measured and realized. 
Experimental and simulated results appear the opposite 
shifts of resonant dips which are attributed by material-
dispersion control on the device. We believed that it can 
be further developed into a state of the art hollow core 
based fiber devices for practical applications.

Abstract: We have proposed an ultracompact reflective self-interference of fiber Lloyd’s 
interferometer (SIFLI) based on an ultrathin Au film embedded in a diffused-core fiber 
endface. Interference fringes are observed experimentally and investigated for the first time.

Interference. 
1. Introduction 
Varieties of inline fiber interferometers (FIs) have been proposed using many smart and hybrid structures to 
manage the wide fields of practical applications on bio-sensing, chemical sensing, and various physical sensing 
[1-3]. Lee et al. have presented a self-interference fringes created by a single long-period fiber grating (LPG) 
made by in a double-cladding fiber with one end of fiber is coated a metal film [2]. The above studies are 
practical, however, most studies on fiber-based interferometers usually have highly complicated fabrication 
processes (e.g., LPG writing, fiber tapering, fiber sidepolish or special fibers’ fusion techniques). 
In the present paper, for the first time, an ultracompact, and robust reflection type self-interference fiber 
Lloyd’s interferometer (SIFLI) based on an ultrathin Au film embedded in diffused-core fiber with a plane or 
convex fiber endface is investigated experimentally. The interference mechanism of the proposed SIFLI is based 
on the two beam interference in the Lloyd’s mirror [4]. Here the Au thin film obtains a partly reflection at the 
interface which is embedded in the single mode fiber (SMF) to split the optical power into reflection and 
transmission paths. The fiber endface can act like the Lloyd’s mirror based on the Fresnel reflection to form a 
3D real/virtual image from the input beam (object), which is the major cause of the interference phenomenon 
from these two Gaussian beams. The self-interference fringes caused by the plane or convex Lloyd’s mirror of 
diffused-core fiber endface have been measured experimentally. The proposed SIFLI has specific features (e.g., 
simple structure and rapid fabrication) in addition to having preferable characteristics of miniaturization and no 
alignment required. 
2. Experiment and measurement principle  
In this experiment, a commercial fusion splicer with controlling the time and current of the electrical discharge 
to destroy the tip of fiber core structure, a diffused-core region with different shape and different length of 
several tens of micrometers can be formed. We call this region the diffused-core gap (DCG). Once the 
fundamental mode reaches the boundary of the fiber core and DCG, an extremely little light (I1) might reflect 
through the Fresnel reflection results in the others transmitting diffractive and broadened light like a Gaussian 
beam propagating until they reach the fiber endface. We previously expected the extremely small amount of the 
reflection (I1~5⋅10-7) light by interface of core and DCG re-enters the fiber, recombining with the Fresnel 
reflection ((I2~0.04)) by endface to obtain interference fringes, however, the intensity of I1 and I2 are far 
different resulting no interference generation. For enhancing the reflection I1, an Au ultrathin film is embedded 
in SMF before fabricating DCG by the electrical discharge. Figures 1(a) and (b) illustrate the diagrams for the 
interference mechanism of the devices with plane and convex mirror structures, respectively. In the case of 
Figure 1(a), the fiber endface can be treated as a plane Fresnel mirror with a virtual image formed on the virtual 
space. Meanwhile, in Figure 1(b), the image point is produced from the concave spherical mirror and can be 
analyzed using the well-known geometrical optics, the imaging theorem of the sphere mirrors [5]. In Figure 
1(b), c is the curvature center and R is the curvature radius. Here the So and Si are defined as object and image 
length in the geometrical structure, respectively.

1. Introduction 
Numerous in-fiber interferometers have been reported by use of many smart and hybrid structures to manage the 
wide fields of practical applications on bio-sensing, chemical sensing, and various physical sensing. It is 
particularly worth to mentioned, hybrid structure of multimode fiber interferometer (MMFI) with the merits of 
simplicity of optical scheme, extra low cost and high temperature stability attracts the researchers’ attentions 
[1-6]. The MMFIs are widely applied to temperature [1], refractive index (RI) sensing [3-4] and others’ practical 
applications [5-6]. The structures of the above studies are based on a single mode fiber (SMF) splicing a section 
of no core fibers (NCF) or multimode fibers (MMF) and the interference mechanism is according to the 
re-imaging theory in the regions of the above structures. Fundamental mode input from the SMF propagating to 
the NCF can excite some multi-modes (high order cladding modes) and converge on some points in optical axis 
of the NCF region based on the re-imaging theory. We found that the re-imaging theory is still existed in the 
leaky waveguide situation. However, most the studies of the MMFIs based on the re-imaging theory are 
operated on the internal total reflection (ITR) with the RI of the surrounding (n3) lower than that of the silica 
fiber (nsi). The leaky-guided modal interference characteristics when the RI of surrounding higher than the silica 
fiber and even the spectral wavelength dips in the proposed MMFIs with inverse properties to the well know 
long-period fiber grating (LPG) have not discussed in the published papers so far. Therefore, in this paper, a 
leaky-guided multimode fiber interferometer (LG-MMFI) based on the leaky-guided modes interference 
mechanism is investigated both analytically and experimentally.  
2. Experiment and measurement principle  
In this experiment, a sandwich structure of SMF-NCF-SMF of the proposed LG-MMFI can be easily fabricated 
by using a commercial fusion splicer which is shown in Fig.1. Based on the re-imaging theory, reimaging inside 
the NCF with as a “lensing” effect and the intensity distribution of the light within the NCF region converges 
periodically at some points in the optical axis. Figure 2 shows the numerical finite difference beam propagation 
method (FD-BPM) calculation [7] of the intensity inside a length of around 4mm NCF when input wavelength 
λ=1405nm, and RI of surrounding (n3=1). It can be seen, the result shows many destructive interference at the 
position of around 3mm, 3.4mm and 3.8mm of the NCF. Thus, we use the length (L) of around 3.4mm NCF to 
form the structure for the studied device. The light intensity, interference mode pattern at position of 3.4mm, 
mode field propagating along z axis inside NCF with a length of 4mm, and normalized intensity at optical axis 
X=0 along propagating z axis are all displayed in the Fig.2. For understanding the proposed LG-MMFI under 
the leaky mode situation (n3>nsi), theoretical optical characteristics of this case is still accomplished by the 
FD-BPM method which is shown in Fig.3. The simulation results show the re-imaging theory as well as the 
leaky-guided modes interference are observed with the RI of surrounding n3 =1.8 (Cargille@ optical liquid) 
based on the Fresnel reflection. It demonstrates that if the RI of the surrounding is sufficiently greater than that 
of the NCF, the Fresnel reflection could enable reasonably low-loss propagation in the NCF of the device.

( )3,nnheff λ  are effective indices of core and high order modes, respectively. Here the ( )3,nnheff λ is the function of 
λ and n3 since the evanescent wave of the high order modes are stretching into the surrounding and strongly 
influenced by the RI of ambient (n3). Therefore, by rearranging the Eq. (1), the following equation can be 
obtained:

Where heffcoeffeff nnn −=Δ  denotes difference of core and high order modes. Since the value of (λD/Δneff)⋅(∂Δneff/∂λ) 
is greater than 1, the denominator of Eq.(2) is negative. It means the dλD /dn3is positive with the properties of the 
λD is getting large when the n3 increases. It also can be seen in Fig. 4(a), experimental results show that the λD 
shifts to long wavelength side when the RI of ambient increases on the guided condition: n3<nsi. However, when 
RI of the surrounding is sufficiently greater than silica fiber n3>nsi, it is a leaky wave guided situation; the 
dispersion relations for the modes no longer have purely real solutions but having imaginary type (lossy modes). 
When the n3 is sufficiently greater than silica fiber nsi, we can determine the real portion of the mode 
propagation constants are merely based on the RI of n=1condition with different imaginary portion even the n3 
changes [8]. Thus, the high order mode related to n3: 3/ nn heff ∂∂  in Eq. (2) is a very small negative value and it 
approaches to zero when n3 is very high: 0/ 3 ≈∂∂ nnheff . It means the λD is almost fixed at very high n3 and be 
close to the wavelength dip with n3 is air. The inset of the Fig. 2(b) demonstrates the Δλ with small change and 
roughly remaining constant when the n3 is greater than 1.6.

situations respectively. Insets display the corresponding wavelength shift (Δλ) sensitivity to the n3 in the two cases. The shifts are measured

This study has investigated and analyzed a multimode fiber interferometer based on leaky-guided modes 
interference mechanism. The spectral responses in the proposed MMFIs with totally inverse properties to the 
general LPG [8] not only in the leaky-guided situation but also in the case of the n3 lower than that of silica. The 
distinct spectral characteristics of the proposed MMFI are based on the interference caused by the OPD of the 
modes. However, in LPGs, the operation mechanism is based on the core and cladding modes coupling since the 
additional grating vector assisted.
