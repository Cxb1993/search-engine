ABSTRACT 
 
This paper proposes a technique of realizing sub-wavelength focusing spot on surface by modifying the spatial 
phase in far-field. This focusing spot will use to detect the spectrum of the monolayer biomolecules on the planar 
surface. Taking the advantage of modifying spatial phase and polarization of incident laser beam, the field 
distribution in near-field (near focal point) can be changed and can achieve to the smallest spot size of 
sub-wavelength under the reasonable adjustment of the phase and polarization of incident beam in far-field. Although 
nano-scale light sources can produce by labelling dye on nanoparticles, quantum dots etc., but technically it is not 
easy to finely manipulate nanoparticles. On the contrary, using the planar thin film of matured, reliable fabrication 
processes, not only the near-field twisted electromagnetic of nanostructure can be eliminated, but also fixing the 
biomolecules on planar surface makes its arrangement to have the consistent direction, thereupon the overall 
behavior of molecular vibration is simple, pure, and advantageous to detect the vibrational spectra of the monolayer 
molecules on surface.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Attenuated total reflection (ATR) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor has the most sensitivity among the 
optical evanescent wave biosensors with total internal reflection (TIR). It has some advantages which are label-free, 
specific, quantitative, real-time kinetics analysis, high sensitivity, and high throughput1,2, but unfortunately, this type 
of biosensors can not directly recognize the biomolecular structure. Recognition of biomolecular structure is very 
important to monitor the behavior of biological behavior which is originated from the interaction of biomolecules, 
e.g. DNA hybridization, DNA replication; or the structure change of biomolecules under different PH scale, 
temperature, solvent, or introduce other biomolecules, e.g. the change of DNA secondary structure, protein secondary 
structure, or protein conformation, etc. SPR is a physical phenomenon in which the electron is excited by evanescent 
wave and vibrates coherently, called surface plasmons (SPs), the electromagnetic wave in near field is enhanced with 
existed SPR. Because of proper optical characteristics in visible light of gold and silver, fundamental, extensive study

Superposing of all transmitted and reflective waves, computed by following the equations from Homola et al1 andYih 
et al2, respectively, one can obtain the distributions of transmittance and reflectivity under focusing excitation. 
 
2.2. Data digitization and intensity normalization 
In numerical computing, the discrete points number of ρ ,ϕ  determine how close the computed results 
converge to a constant, as shown in Fig. 2. Every computed point refers to a plane wave with incident angle θ , 
which θρ sin0n=  and 0n  is the refractive index of incident medium. For saving time, the following results is 
computed with adopted onn 05.0×=Δ=Δ θρ  and o1=Δϕ , which the deviation of intensity is smaller than 10%. 
The intensity of electric field is normalized by the total number of computed incident light, e.g. the incident angle θ  
covers 30°~40°, ϕ  covers 0°~360° the total number of incident light is 72000]1/360[]05.0/)3040[( =×− . 
Assume the configuration of multiple film is objective (BK7, 1.5222@488nm) / silver film (47nm, 
-7.9+0.736j@488nm) / air (1@488nm), which is the same as Kano et al.21 In this condition, the SPR angle is 44.780°. 
Choose computing angle range covering 44.66°~44.93°, corresponding to 075.1~07.1=ρ  which formed an 
annulus on pupil plane. That is an incident plane wave of linear polarization coming from the objective is obstructed 
except in this annulus and excites the evanescent wave at interface between silver and air. The total number of light is 
108001/36030 =× , which 31084.8 −×=Δθ °, and the maximum transmittance on interface is 23.425, which 
deviation of intensity is < 6.6%.  
2.3. Experiment setup 
The scheme of focusing excitation can be easy achieved when using a microscopic object lens, but the phase 
modification of light wave is difficult to realize because the size of objective pupil is usually smaller than 10mm. 
Here, we adopted a deformable mirror to control wave front for adjusting flexibly to various focal points, e.g. 
centered, donut, etc.  
The diagram of experimental setup is shown as Fig. 3. A He-Ne laser is conducted into deformable mirror 
(Intelllite, MultiTM25-37), which adjusts the wave front with 37 piezoelectric cells, firstly with a beamsplitter. Then, 
the evanescent wave is excited at the interface of substrate (BK7) and air when light is focused with using an 
oil-immersed objective, Olympus UPLSAPO 100XO of NA 1.4 and entrance pupil of 6 mm. A CCD (Sony, XC-77) 
is placed on the focal plane, conjugated with objective focal plane, of imaging lens, Fourier Lens (focal length of 365 
mm), to image the focal plane of objective when a part of light is conducted by a beamsplitter installed on foldable 
mount. Before entering the spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon TRIAX 320, equipped 1200 lp/mm grating and photo-multiple 
tube), a holographic notch filter (Asahi Spectra, OD≧6) is used to decline the intensity of Rayleigh scattering light.  
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
3.1. Focusing excitation of surface plasmons of radial polarization 
The polarization, amplitude, phase, and incident angle of incident light alter the transmittance under TIR or ATR. 
For exciting the surface plasmons, radial polarization must been chosen; modified amplitude alters less change on 
transmittance; phase and incident angle is coupled each other to alter the transmittance. Thus, if one finely modified 
the phase and incident angle of incident light on pupil plane, a focusing point near focal plane can be modulated 
obviously. The maximum transmittance occurs when all plane waves from different incident angles combine at focal 
point with zero phase difference, resulting constructive diffraction. Next, five configurations of thin film with
