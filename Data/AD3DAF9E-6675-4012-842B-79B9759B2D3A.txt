一、 前言 
經研究調查顯示，石化製程所使用或生成的危害性化學物質由於本身屬於熱敏感性物質，具有熱
分解導致高放熱量及產生大量氣態污染物的危害特性，宛如潛藏於工廠的不定時炸彈，一旦在儲存、
運送、製造與使用上因非預期因素而導致製程偏離正常操作範圍，而反應所產生的熱又無法及時排除，
其伴隨產生之巨大熱量或氣體壓力將造成整個反應製程失去控制，而釀成損失慘重的巨災。因此石化
製程中危害性物質的衍生物及反應過程中潛在之危害性，藉由一系列的熱危害分析探討及不相容性測
試，瞭解生產製程及衍生產物的危害性，以提供妥善的危害預防及緊急應變措施。 
因此，若石化製程排放不當造成居民圍廠抗爭在國內有愈演愈烈之趨勢，直接威脅到工廠生存，
因此緊急排放安全與排放物安全處理之技術已成為許多工廠急需要解決的安全與環保問題。許多化工
製程由於操作上之需要或化學反應之特性，常常在大於常壓狀況下操作或儲存。雖然工廠內有很多安
全預警設計，但由於造成製程異常之原因，如操作錯誤、設備失效、火災、化學反應失控等，若無法
有效排除，仍然會造成操作壓力超過安全上限，因此為了防止設備破裂或損壞，使用適當之洩壓裝置
進行設備之緊急排放，往往是勢在必行的措施。製程的緊急排放依過壓來源可分為反應性與非反應性，
反應性緊急排放可再細分為放熱失控反應與燃燒反應，其相關之製程幾乎涵蓋國內所有中大型石化廠
與化工廠，如表 1 所示，由此可知製程排放技術對國內化學工業之重要性。

稀釋方式的使用可以降低潛在的快速分解反應，但是常反而會增加在儲存條件下的自發性分解。此外，
不相容性的污染物質，特別是重金屬化合物、鹼類 (含胺類)、強酸或其他種類的雜質亦可能造成有機
過氧化物的不安定反應。所以儲存時避免污染物的污染是必要的，所以一般條件下結晶物與助催化劑
不可直接加入有機過氧化物內。而有一些水溶性的過氧酸 (aqueous peroxy acids) 可利用一些可吸附重
金屬離子的複合物抗結晶劑 (如 dipicolinic acis 與 sodium pyrophosphate) 降低分解反應速率，但是並
非所有有機過氧化物都適用安定劑 (stabilizers)。 
TBPH 的製造有幾種不同途徑與方式，主要的製造方法基本上有密閉式批次法 (closed batch) 和
密閉式連續法 (continuous process) 兩種。異丁烷和液態氧在密閉系統中的直接反應生成 70% TBHP，
(CH3)3CH + O2 → (CH3)3COOH，此法在商業應用上屬最大宗。另外也可將第三丁基醇和 30% 過氧化
氫在硫酸存在下反應生成 TBHP：(CH3)3COH + H2O2 → (CH3)3COOH。TBPH 廣用於化學中間物主要
是將丙烯氧化成環氧丙烷 (propylene oxide)。 
高濃度之 TBHP 水溶液受熱或微量不相容物之酸和某些金屬之鹽如錳 (manganese)、鐵 (iron) 和
鈷 (cobalt) 作用會產生劇烈的放熱反應，若和有機化合物或氧化物質不慎混合時可能引起火災或爆
炸。製程條件中如不慎混合上述不相容物則可能造成失控反應 (runaway reaction) 或熱爆炸 (thermal 
explosion) 災害。 
CHP 高度的反應性及氧化性使其廣泛使用於研究實驗室及工業上，對於 CHP 的危害資訊及反應
形成的化學物質亦發表在國際文獻中。異丙苯過氧化氫為化學工業重要的有機過氧化物之一。常用以
作為聚苯乙烯-丁二烯-丙烯腈 (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, ABS) 聚合中後段的苯乙烯和丁二烯的乳
膠共聚合的起始劑；石化業以異丙苯 (cumene) 氧化後形成 CHP，再加以酸裂解製造酚 (phenol)，而
特化業加以脫水形成 DCPO (di-cumyl peroxide) 作為樹酯硬化劑。表 6 為本國 CHP 相關上下游石化
產業之產量 [11]。

根據工研院工安衛中心與雲林科技大學環安系藉由熱卡計技術如微差掃瞄熱卡計 DSC、絕熱卡計 
VSP2 等，初步對 CHP 作熱分解實驗，已獲得一些熱分解數據、動力學參數如反應級數 n = 0.5、活
化能 Ea = 122.0 ± 3.0 (kJ mol–1)、頻率因子 lnA = 30.0 ± 1.2 (M1/2 min–1) 等。瞭解到 CHP 含不相容性
物質時之熱危害特性。一連串的研究用以調查及評估 CHP 的分解特性、初步熱危害和反應動力學 
[12–15]。 
(6) 杜逸興教授等人 1997 年於 Trans. IChemE Part B, (Process Safety and Environmental Protection) 發
表 “Runaway Hazard Assessment of Cumene Hydroperoxide from the Cumene Oxidation Process” 與 
1998 年於 Institution of Chemical Engineers 發表  “Thermal decomposition kinetics of cumene 
hydroperoxide” 
以 DSC 進行異丙苯過氧化氫 (CHP) 昇溫掃瞄，以獲得試樣熱分解之熱譜圖，以對熱危害性有
一初步瞭解，並進一步以 VSP2 模擬絕熱失控反應的情況，藉此獲得製程及儲運污染狀態之熱危害分
析常用的數據，以求得放熱起始溫度  (T0)、最高溫度  (Tmax)、最大壓力 (Pmax)、昇溫速率  (dT/dt)  與
昇壓速率 (dP/dt) 等數據，最終目的即在以異丙苯過氧化氫此類熱不穩定性之物質之影響進行熱危害
 11 
各種不相容性物質對於異丙苯過氧化氫之熱失控反應的危害影響等級如下： 
 
   C6H5C(CH3)2OO－ (alkaline) > C6H5C(CH3)2O+ (H+) 
>C6H5C(CH3)2O∙ (thermal) > C6H5C(CH3)2OO∙ (Fe3+)                           (3–8) 
 
研究結果顯示 CHP 不相容性實驗與 CHP 之熱失控反應有所差異，酸根對於 CHP 的反應與 
CHP 本身並無明顯變化，所以製程上常用酸作為製程催化劑，但其放熱起始溫度則略微提前；而鹼根
對於 CHP 之作用則明顯有危害現象。 
CHP 等有機過氧化物的熱分解行為與反應機制的研究成果顯示其具備多樣的反應複雜性，且其熱
分解與製程中反應途徑尚未進行熱危害與反應產物的交叉分析，藉由熱危害分析與產物定性定量技術
相互結合，由產物變化情形探討 CHP 熱分解與酸鹼催化反應行為，利用巨觀與微觀方式充分瞭解其
危害因子，並可藉此得到最佳製程條件，有效建立物質本質安全參數、建立可信賴的反應動力學、獲
得 CHP 上下游製程產物分析、反應機制推估及製程最佳產量設計。 
(8)  杜逸興教授等人 2008 年於 Process Safety Progress 發表 “Hazard ratings for organic peroxides” 
利用絕熱卡計如  DSC、ARC (accelerating rate calorimeter) 與  VSP2 測試九種常見有機
過氧化物： cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)、di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP)、methyl-ethyl-ketone peroxide 
(MEKPO)、tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)、benzoyl peroxide (BPO)、hydrogen peroxide、lauroyl peroxide 
(LPO)、tert-butyl perbenzoate (TBPBZ) 與 dicumyl peroxide (DCPO) 的熱危害與不相容性。  
而針對這些有機過氧化物自反應分解的危害評估，比較其自低溫狀態下進行放熱反
應的熱不安定性依序為：  
 
MEKPO (T0 = 40 oC) > TBHP (T0 = 65 oC) > LPO (T0 = 70 oC) > TBPBZ (T0 = 90 oC) > CHP (T0 = 100 oC) > 
BPO (T0 = 104 oC) > DTBP (T0 = 105 oC) > DCPO (T0=110 oC)                                 (3–9) 
 
而比較危害等級的嚴重性需考慮絕熱狀態失控反應之自加熱速率與分解熱。另外，
有機過氧化物若與其他混合物反應產生不相容性反應會讓放熱起始溫度降低為  25 oC 
或使分解熱增加  25%。可能造成有機過氧化物不相容性危害的酸或鹼如下：  
 
CHP + 6 N HCl、CHP + 6 N NaOH、DTBP + 6 N HCl、MEKPO + 6 N HCl、 MEKPO + 6 N NaOH、TBHP 
+ 6 N HCL、TBHP + 6 N NaOH、LPO + 6 N HCl、LPO + 6 N NaOH。 
 
四、研究方法 
國外著名的石化公司如 ICI, Ciba-Geigy, Merck, Dow Chemical, DuPont 等均有他們各自發展的化
學品反應性危害測試流程，在文獻中，對於反應熱危害的評估方法已有相當完整的探討，較具代表性
的文獻有 Grewer、Yoshida、CCPS 等專書，其大致包括四個部分：(1) 燃燒爆炸特性測試，(2) 正常
反應操作測試，(3) 反應放熱強度及最低反應起始溫度，(4) 異常失控反應後果測試。圖 5 整理了美
國化工學會 (AIChE) 化學製程安全中心 (CCPS) 的化學反應危害測試流程，從測試流程圖中可以瞭解
到進行安全設計所應建立的基本安全參數，再與文獻中不同安全分析方法所需建立的化學危害資料比
對，提出了本質較安全設計的化學性危害評估架構，希望能藉此來建立製程反應相關物質的各項化學
危害特性，掌握製程的基本危害潛能。國際上目前普遍使用的反應熱危害測試技術，大致為：熱分析
技術 (Thermal Analysis Technology)、絕熱卡計技術 (Adiabatic Calorimetry Technology)、緊急排放控制

第二年度：危害性物質測試安全規劃 
熱卡計是評估反應熱危害的基本工具，幾乎所有的物理或化學操作都會伴隨著熱量的變化，熱量
的量測是瞭解這些變化的方法之一，在製程與裝置設計時亦需依賴熱量變化的數據，而不正常或是未
控制的放熱更是重要的危害來源，目前國際上普遍使用的反應熱危害測試技術，大致可分為：熱分析
技術 (Thermal Analysis Technology)、絕熱卡計技術 (Adiabatic Calorimetry Technology)、緊急排放控制
DIERS 技術 (Emergency Relief Control Technology)、反應卡計技術 (Reaction Calorimetry Technology) 
等四種，主要運用於實驗室階段的反應危害測試評量與初步的放大安全評估。 
第二個階段則以「實例驗證與放大測試」為主，首先以實際案例的評估驗證來確認石化廠對於熱
穩定性測試、絕熱失控測試、動力學模式建立直到理論上的放大安全評估的能力。接著再以反應裝置
的測試驗證，協助石化廠廠建立危害性物質測試安全規劃與製程最佳化條件評估驗證之能力。 
第三年度：危害性物質測試安全規劃 
典型的製程的研發流程中，通常包括了實驗室、實驗工廠與生產工廠等三個階段之逐步測試、
放大，表7中列出了各規模階段的反應危害評估重點，必須在各個階段中有效的掌握潛在的反應
危害，才能夠達成安全放大設計的目標，確保未來工廠的操作安全。本計畫的主要目標即是
協助石化廠建立此一完整的「反應危害本質較安全技術」能力。

反應製程的失控危害評估，必須藉由精密、可靠的測試儀器，在熟練的技術人員操作下進行有系
統的測試與分析，同時配合理論模擬技術，來建立製程反應動力學模式，瞭解失控反應可能情境，進
 15 
應系統，量測可信度高與最壞狀況的資料對於緊急排放系統的設計是非常重要的。在失控反應發生之
兩相流狀況下，梁仲明博士發現可用簡易化方式計算緊急排放面積，而不需要先求得動力學數據。這
些針對排放口徑設計的關鍵數據有自加熱速率、反應物之比熱、平均熱生成速率、汽化熱與過熱等。
而絕熱卡計如 VSP2、Phi Tec II 或 DEWAR 可得到自加熱速率、平均自加熱速率、過熱與壓力行為。 
工業上使用之化學物質在運送、儲存或製程中常具有潛藏性的反應性危害，因為不穩定的化學物
質若含有化學不相容物或其它化學物質時易引發瞬間的放熱或產生氣體，而遭受機械性撞擊、受熱或
物理性震動等可能會產生爆炸性的危害。有些情況下，如果周遭環境有腐蝕、火災等意外出現亦可能
引起化學物質本身不必要的反應出現。依據美國環保署有害廢棄物相容性判斷方法，當使用兩種化學
物質混合時，若產生下列現象，則稱此兩種物質不相容： 
(1) 放熱 (heat generation)。 
(2) 著火 (fire)。 
(3) 產生有毒氣體 (toxic gas formation)。 
(4) 產生可燃氣体 (flammable gas formation)。 
(5) 揮發出毒性或易燃性物質 (innocuous and non-flammable gas generation)。 
(6) 產生不穩定物質。 
(7) 產生高壓 (pressurization)。 
(8) 溶出毒性物質 (solubilization of toxic substance)。 
(9) 釋出有毒粉塵、酸霧、粒狀物。 
(10) 劇烈聚合反應 (violent polymerization)。 
    大部分化學品因熱化學上趨向最低能量的關係，其生產製程過程屬於放熱性反應，因此都具有熱
「失控」的潛在危害。物質在製造或儲運過程中，亦可能由於一些不可預期的因素 (如進料控制錯誤、
雜質、中間物分解、冷卻系統故障及外界火災等) 而偏離正常操作範圍，造成劇烈的放熱反應，此時
反應所產生的熱量若無法迅速移除，則將導致反應物系統溫度上升並加快反應，進一步加速放熱現象。
如果同時引發了其他強烈的放熱反應，則伴隨而來的熱量或氣體壓力將造成整個製程反應失去控制，
造成安全閥或破裂片開啟以進行緊急排放，釋放過高的壓力。倘若緊急排放系統設計不良，則有可能
導致熱爆炸 (thermal explosion)、火災，或是有害性的毒性化學品大量排放等嚴重災害，將對工廠或社
會造成極大損失。像 1976 年義大利薩維梭 (Seveso) 之四氯雙苯戴奧辛 (TCDD) 排放事故或 1984 
年印度波帕 (Bhopal) 之異氰酸甲酯 (MIC) 外洩災難造成數千人死亡，都是最好的例證。因此對於製
程中化學物質的熱穩定性、反應特性、火災爆炸特性以及失控現象的瞭解分析乃是防制失控反應災害
的先決條件。 
緊急排放兩相流設計原理[DIERS, 1992] 
氣體、液體、二相流及內沸流之排放量、質量通量可由 (4–1) 式所示。API RP 520 以過壓源求對
應之排放量 W 及單相流體之質量通量 G 代入可求得 A 及物理參數之對應公式。而兩相流或閃沸流
體則考慮可能最槽狀況之 W 及兩相流體之 G，由 (4–2) 式求得排放面積。而 W 與反應物質量，放
熱速率 (反應熱力動力學)、汽化熱、比熱及反應器的可承受的過壓比例有關。 
反應器兩相排放設計原理可參考 Bolye 方法、J. E. Huff 方法、H. K. Fauske 方法與 J. C. Leung 
方法。茲舉出梁仲明 (J. C. Lenug) 博士提出之方法為例。1986 年梁仲明博士結合能量與質量平衡方

  Pb < Pc (choking/critical flow) 
  Pc/P0 =ηc 
  Pb/P0=η 
  臨界壓力比 ηc (1<ω<100) 表示成 
  ηc = 0.55 +0.217(lnω) –0.46 ( lnω)2+0.004(lnω)3                                         (4–9) 
  若 ω>10, 取 ηc 約等於 0.9 則 
  Gc* = Gc/P0ρ0 =ηc/ω=0.9/ω 
  代入 ω 定義可求得 
  Gc= 0.9[P0ρ0(hfg/vfg)2/ P0ρ0T0Cp]0.5                                                           (4–10) 
  Gc= 0.9hfg/vfg(CpT0)0.5                                                              b (4–11) 
   
若是非閃沸系統 (non-flashing) 則 ω 定義的第貳項消失，ω = α0。 
  除了單純氣相，液相之外，兩相排放行為與液體及蒸氣表面速率 (vapor superficial velocity) 有關，
DIERS、Zuber 與 Findly 及 Grolmes 研究的 Drift–Flux 模式亦提出氣泡流 (bubbly flow) 與攪亂流 
(churn-turbulent flow) 流體形式。 
 
五、 結果與討論 
針對反應系統，依據反應物與生成物能量平衡理論所得之反應熱通常會造成桶槽之過壓 
(overpressure) 現象，最遭情況 (worst case scenario) 製程條件的偏差，此時需由絕熱卡計重新量測或依
據製程工程師的經驗判定，失控反應的嚴重性是依據自加熱速率與壓力生成速率而決定。依據 Fauske 
與 Leung 推導之經驗方程式[Fauske and Leung, 1985]，緊急排放面積係直接與自加熱速率成一定比例設計而
來。通常，Leung 推導之分析方程式是最普遍使用的方法之一，排放口徑之關鍵參數為自加熱速率，
其可直接由低 ψ 值的絕熱卡計設備測得。ARC (accelerating rate calorimeter) 的 ψ 值介於 2–10之間，
是一種早期發展的絕熱卡計，由此卡計高 ψ 值條件下測得之自加熱速率於應用時需修正至 ψ = 1.3 
[Wilcock and Rogers, 1997] 較為準確 [31]。 
Fisher 與 Huff 推導出兩種校正 ψ 值的方法[Huff, 1982]，而依據 Wilcock 與 Rogers 的研究[Wilcock, 
1997] 顯示 Huff  法的模擬數據比 Fisher 法準確。此外，由絕熱卡計得到需要的數據，自加熱速率可
由 DSC得到動力學數據或由傳統化學動力學的數據得到。Fisher 建議以下列公式校正 ψ 值：

這些校正方程式可能無法得到實際的自加熱速率，因為其未考慮反應階數、自催化行為、氣體之生成
與熱轉換效應。為避免計算不正確的排放面積口徑，自加熱速率應以較佳的絕熱卡計量測或由化學動
 19 
各失控反應類型的排放尺徑計算公式有所不同，茲說明各反應系統如下： 
1. 蒸汽 (調和) 系統 (vapor (tempered) system)：過壓來自溶劑蒸汽壓，洩放過程中，反應熱被液體汽
化冷卻 效應調和，溫度與壓力將停止上升。 
2. 氣態 (非調和) 系統 (gassy (non-tempered) system)：過壓來自非冷凝氣體產物，洩放過程中，不具
調和效應，溫度依然持續上升。 
3. 混和 (調和) 系統 (hybrid (tempered) system)：過壓同時來自溶劑蒸汽壓與非冷凝氣體產物。 
排放行為 (venting behavior)  
電腦模擬排放前後狀態的時間評估與動力學行為，Rota 等細心推導出排放時結合質量與能量平衡
的公式來表示動力學的自加熱速率[Rota et al., 2002]。緩和系統 (tempered system) 中，反應槽的簡易能量行
為可用下列簡易化的公式來表示[Leung, 1987]： 
fv

dTmC −=                                                                     (5–14) 
流體排放共有純蒸氣排放 (pure vapor venting)、泡泡流 (bubbly flow)、攪亂流 (churn-turbulent flow) 與
均勻兩相流 (homogenous flow) 等常見四種行為，在桶槽內的流體行為流程，以 drift flux model 來加
以模擬。DIERS 報告中有討論氣液分離的現象[AIChE, 1992]，Leung 則討論過壓與排放行為在緊急排放時
的流程[Leung, 1987]，這些研究證明桶槽中均勻兩相排放有最大的排放速率。此外，勻相桶槽流體在相同
過壓狀況下亦需要最大排放面積。在傳統且明確的工程觀點上，建議以蒸氣壓系統的均勻兩相流為主
要流程。考慮簡易性的設計下，質量流速率 (mass flow rate, W) 的分析方程式如下：

氣相的排放口徑 
考量有機過氧化物分解時非冷凝性氣體的釋出量，各種針對氣相系統簡易化的口徑設計被廣泛討
論與應用，其中包括 Fauske、Huff 與 Leung 的簡化方程式[Leung, 1987, 1992; Huff, 1984]。而氣相系統與非緩
和系統中最重要的是排放面積的口徑設計與評估質量流速率。因蒸氣消失所引起的潛熱 (latent heat)  
會形成蒸發式冷卻 (evaporative cooling)，若蒸汽比例太少則反應失控時溫度是非緩和 (non-tempered) 
的。根據穩態 (steady-state) 假設，是以容積速率平衡 (volumetric rate balance) 為設計方法，一般常以
考量容積速率平衡的最大可容許壓力 (maximum allowable pressure, MAP) 進行最保守估計的計算。因

以 35 mass% CHP 儲槽失控反應來計算緊急排放系統之設計條件列於表 9。異丙苯過氧化氫在台
灣工業上廣泛使用於聚合作用中的起始劑，尤其是 acrylonitile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) 的共聚合反應 
(copolymerization)。另外，CHP 也用廣泛應用於製造酚與丙酮的酸性裂解製程。CHP 製造常以異丙苯
與空氣中的氧氣氧化而成，初始階段控制在 20 mass% 到 35 mass% 後，再進行濃縮製程，濃度可達 80 
mass%。或者再與無機酸反應成酚或進行雙聚合及脫水反應成二異丙苯過氧化氫 (DCPO)。有機過氧化
物分解會釋出非冷凝性氣體，而此濃度區的 CHP 壓力行為視為混合系統，我們一開始將其設限成蒸
氣系統，接著再視為氣體系統。

預期成果 
基於簡單化、效率化、經濟化、避免危險與簡易操作等理由，本文以熱卡計技術結合物質本身之
動力參數、物性資料與 Leung 的 ω methodology 而建立本分析方法。緩和相、氣相或混合相的壓力
行為則可以絕熱卡計實驗求得相關數據。以反應性單體與有機過氧化物為例，由 Leung’s ω methodology 
探討排放口徑，並比較 n 階反應與自催化反應的影響及表現。 
本計畫之規畫與執行可以建立有關產業製程安全評估、危害物質特性、風險評估、人員操作的可
靠度；推廣危害性物質在製程中可能發生之危害的相關理論、特性及實務經驗。因此本計畫完成後對
於學術研究、產業發展之貢獻如下： 
1. 危害性物質熱分析技術、熱危害數據之資料建立，將可作為製程與儲運安全設計或製程條件最
佳化之用。完成不相容性物質之熱危害分析時，包含並聯反應和串聯反應之複式反應的製程反
應失控模擬，建立產業界的製程安全資訊。 
2. 建立國內石化產業使用化學批次反應之系統操作人員可靠度分析作業方法與程序、資料庫。強
化製造、加工或使用危險物工廠之安全管理。避免災害發生時，除造成本廠財物損失或人員傷
亡外，甚或波及鄰廠，造成他廠之財物損失或人員傷亡。因此，為強化該等工廠安全管理，以
預防及降低重大工安事故之衝擊。 
3. 國內石化產業針對製程之熱危害分析仍處於初期研究階段，應可將本計畫之成果以產學合作方
式快速轉移給業界運用，作為製程安全設計或製程條件最佳化之用，以降低業者在營運、安全
及環保上之風險，此舉極符合產業科技學術合作之宗旨，亦符合中小企業運用國營事業科技責
任照顧之心意。製程安全中一般極少探究之熱危害與其形成之不相容性危害有非常重要與關鍵
性的貢獻。 
4. 本研究係建立熱分析在本質較安全評量基準架構：製程的本質危害、可使用性、可操作性、可
觀察性及可保護性等五項指標，其中製程的本質危害指標與製程路徑選擇有關，一旦製程路徑
確定後，就不容易再加以變更，因此為製程路徑選擇的一個特性。其他的四項指標，則與工廠
安全設計與運作情況有關，為工廠製程安全程度的一個評核工具，可作為安全技術提昇的一個
重要參考。在製程設計的化學性危害評估架構中整理出石化產業相關製程安全設計所需建立的
各項數據。

Introduction 
 
The 24-hour operating process of high-tech manufacturing represents a significant potential 
liability to the owner, operator, and general public in terms of life safety and preservation of 
assets, due to heavy use of hazardous production materials (HPM) in a cleanroom. 
Furthermore, the high-tech products and process tools are highly sensitive to smoke, 
particulates, and moisture. Therefore, a cleanroom is necessary to maintain the required air 
quality, along with the necessary humidity and particulate number to prevent the high-tech 
products from suffering pollutant contamination. These factors raised the risks involved in 
operating such plants, particularly the fire incident. In the event of a fire, the resultant damage 
and property loss is much higher than in conflagrations in other types of buildings due to past 
fire accident cases. Apparently, the requirements by current prescriptive design cannot fully 
meet the real needs for fire safety design of the unique 3-level cleanroom in Taiwan, 
including supply air chamber (SAC), fabrication (FAB), and return air plenum (RAP), such as 
thin film transistor-liquid crystel display (TFT-LCD), and light emitting diode (LED). 
Therefore, these industries have expanded tremendous attention and efforts on developing an 
advanced calamity strategy to reduce the risk of fire. 
Some special features of cleanroom now used in hi-tech plants include the following. 
(1) There are numerous toxic and explosive chemicals being manufactured, processed, and 
stored.  Most of these chemicals are so active that they can readily cause fires or other 
severe damage in the event of accidental leakage. 
(2) The flow field in a cleanroom differs from that in other buildings.  The conditioned air 
flow is drawn downwards vertically from the filter fan unit (FFU) to the FAB area, 
through the perforated raised floor, and eventually to the sub-FAB area, as illustrated in 
Fig. 1. In the event of a fire, the movement of smoke in a cleanroom is expected to differ 
from that in other buildings. Additionally, cleanrooms contain no vertical and horizontal 
fire-endurance compartments because of production line allocation and the air flow 
design mentioned previously.  
(3) Process tools inside cleanrooms are highly sensitive to contamination from 
smoke/particulates and water. 
(4) The zone area of cleanroom for such plants is very large, but the occupant density is low 
due to high automation.  Moreover, the distribution of production lines has become 
increasingly complicated owing to space limitations. Therefore, occupant evacuation 
plans become extremely important and it may alter occasionally due to the retrofit and 
renovation of facilities. 
Because the structure of cleanroom is regarded as an enclosure, where there are no 
openings under normal operating conditions, it is required to equip with the smoke exhaust 
system on the ceiling by most of the fire prescriptive design [3]. Therefore, this study 
introduced the fire safety engineering (FSE) design methodology to provide a so-called 
substituted design equivalency. This methodology usually analyzes and compares smoke 
management strategies to resolve the fire protection situation. 
Therefore, engineering tools, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, are 
applied to design and evaluate the calamity system used in a cleanroom in an advanced 
technology facility.  
 
 
Literature review 
 
Williams and Kathy [1] conducted full-scale measurements in an aircraft hangar with a 
nominal 30.4 m (100 ft) ceiling height. Gas temperatures resulting from an approximately 
 4 
 
Methodology  
  
The basic design tool adopted is FDS, a CFD program devised by National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) [10]. This tool is used to simulate design cleanroom fires 
and thus acquires the corresponding fire and smoke developments. An egress model, 
SIMULEX software [11], is then applied to evaluate the evacuation time required for each 
design fire, together with the information on facility layout and population density. 
This study evaluated upward smoke exhaust system and downward exhaust system based 
on FSE guidelines, and incorporating a decrease of FFU air supply rate in fire zone, to check 
whether such a design can achieve equivalent performance. The main purpose is to 
understand which smoke exhaust system combing FFU is better and how to operate smoke 
exhaust system combining trigger condition and operating procedures for preservation of life 
and property via performance-based design.  
 
 
Smoke management strategy used in a cleanroom 
 
There are various models for controlling smoke by combining air-conditioning and smoke 
exhaust equipment, including downward smoke exhaust equipment (Fig. 2), upward smoke 
exhaust equipment (Fig. 2), and smoke exhaust fan in return air shaft, in a cleanroom shown 
as follows (self-organized):  
 
Smoke management strategy model 1 
 
Smoke management strategy model 1 (Fig. 3) operates mainly downward smoke exhaust 
equipment. Here, the operating procedures and method are expressed as follows: 
 Cut off the connection between return air shaft and supply air plenum (SAP) for 
avoiding smoke to affect air quality through air circulation. 
 Start the smoke exhaust fan in downward smoke system.  
 Close smoke exhaust fan in return air shaft.  
 Close the smoke exhaust fan in upward smoke system. 
 Sustain make-up air unit (MAU) air supply. 
 Sustain normal air flow in FFU of fire zone. 
 Increase speed of the airflow in adjacent fire zones. 
Smoke management strategy model 2 
Smoke management strategy model 2 (Fig. 4) executes only smoke exhaust fan in return air 
shaft, but this strategy cannot reach to the smoke control requirement in FAB area, simply 
because the positions of smoke dampers are too far away from FAB area. The operating 
procedures and method are described as below: 
 Cut off the connection between return air shaft and SAP. 
 Start smoke exhaust fan in return air shaft. 
 Close the smoke exhaust fan in downward smoke system. 
 Close the smoke exhaust fan in upward smoke system. 
 Maintain MAU air supply. 
 Sustain normal air flow in FFU of fire zone. 
 Increase speed of the airflow in adjacent fire zones.

Case studies 
 
This study evaluated the calamity systems in a unique 3-level cleanroom of Taiwan 
semiconductor plants. This study used FDS and SIMULEX as the engineering tools to 
simulate the fire and smoke development by assigned scenarios, and subsequently used the 
occupant evacuation route and time required to reach the safe zone. This study emphasized 
on evaluating the effectiveness and performance for both upward and downward smoke 
exhaust systems. The procedure for selecting an appropriate calamity system followed the 
SFPE Engineering Guide to Performance-based Fire Protection Analysis and Design [12]. 
The performance-based design procedure is detailed as follows.  
 
Definition on simulation scope  
 
(1) A cleanroom on the 2F and 3F at main building (trial design case 1): the dimension of 
3-level cleanroom is 70 m × 72 m × 12 m (simulation configuration is shown in Fig. 8). 
The total simulation time is 330 sec and sampling time is 0.1 sec, selected grid size is 0.5 
m × 0.5 m × 0.5 m, and the highest heat release is 3 MW. 
(2) A cleanroom on B1 and 1F at support building (trial design case 2): the dimension of 
3-level cleanroom is 300 m × 164 m × 12 m (simulation configuration is shown in Fig. 9). 
The total simulation time is 330 sec and sampling time is 0.1 sec, selected grid size is 0.5 
m × 0.5 m × 0.5 m, and the highest heat release is 5.4 MW. 
 
Performance criteria 
 
The performance criteria are the further refinement of design objectives, and take the form of 
numerical values with which the expected performance of the trial designs can be compared. 
Life safety criteria address the survivability of individuals exposed to fire and its by-products. 
As for judgment of smoke layer interface, there is a transition zone (Fig. 10) between 
high temperature smoke layer and low temperature layer. However, the bottom of height in 
transition zone called first indication of smoke. Owing to transition zone, NFPA 92B [13] 
adopts N percentage rule to judge smoke layer height. Therefore, this project employed the 
restrictions that along the evacuation route, the temperature at the height of 1.8 m does not 
exceed 80 °C, and the concentration of the carbon monoxide gas does not exceed 1,400 ppm 
at the same location [14]. Table 1 indicates the life safety criteria, which are specified so that 
the occupants have sufficient time to safely escape. 
 
Development on fire scenarios and design fire 
 
This step involves describing possible fire events, and involves fire, building, and occupant 
characteristics. The FM statistical data [15] on the cleanroom fires in America from 1977 to 
1997 identify primary cause of cleanroom fires (Fig. 11). The key cause is wet bench fires in 
the FAB-zone, so a wet bench fire in the FAB zone is adopted as the fire scenario here.  
The fire scenario in the FAB zone is a wet bench fire, and this fire is assumed not to 
spread to other workstations. FDS simulation divides the FAB area into eight compartments 
and a height of 5 m. Moreover, the fire simulation should include the perforated raised floor 
(2-meter high) and the sub-FAB (5-meter high), as illustrated in Fig. 12. Therefore, the total 
height was 12 m. The selected cubic grid size was 0.125 m3 and 0.0625 m3 to analyze the 
inaccuracy of simulation results. The error analysis result showed that there are 1.3% and 
2.14% at trial design case 1 and trial design case 2, respectively (see Table 2). Sprinkler 
installation complied with NFPA 13 [15] with RTI of 45 and 300, respectively. 
 8 
The FDS simulations comprised four scenarios involving both downward and upward smoke 
exhaust systems. The respective scenarios were evaluated based on whether they can meet the 
performance criteria of life safety. To compare the scenarios with the life safety criteria, 
reference points at the height of 1.8 m in the fire-origin compartment were selected to obtain 
the corresponding temperature and CO concentration. A reference point in scenario 1, 2 was 
set up at 3 m from the center, and other reference points in scenarios 3, 4 at 5.4 m from the 
center, respectively. Finally, smoke movement was visualized using Smokeview, one of the 
FDS functions. 
A. Trial smoke management design 1  
Trial design 1, including scenario 1 and scenario 2, chose a significantly stronger fire of 3 
MW in HRR. A fire was started at the center of the wet bench by simulation when t=0, and 
the ambient temperature was fixed at 24 °C. The air-conditioning continued to operate 
normally, and the smoke exhaust system was closed after the fire. At t= 30 sec, the downward 
smoke exhaust system was manually activated, and smoke exhaust fan in return air shaft was 
also manually activated in scenario 2. The FFU in the fire zone maintained normal air flow in 
FFU of fire zone, and those in the other zones increased to 0.6 m s－1. According to simulation 
results, the highest temperature at 1.8 m height next to 3 m from center was below 32 °C (see 
Fig. 13), which was still below the unattainable one of 80 °C. The highest CO concentration 
at 1.8 m height next to 3 m from center is below 2.1 ppm (see Fig. 14), which is still below 
the unattainable one of 1,400 ppm. Apparently, both CO concentration and temperature met 
the criteria for protecting human life.  
Figure 15 shows that the maximum temperatures in scenarios 1 and 2 are 239 °C and 235 
°C at center of fire source at 1.8 m above floor, respectively. After sprinklers with RTI = 45 
activated at 104 sec and 99 sec, respectively, the average temperature declines to 148 °C and 
132 °C. After that, the temperature dropped suddenly as expected, then quickly recovered and 
subsequently leveled off. Obviously, the fire is not extinguished but is governed by the action 
of sprinkler system. Figure 16 shows that the CO concentration in scenario 1, 2 are 120 ppm 
and 169 ppm at the center of fire source at 1.8 m above floor, respectively. Although the 
temperature at center of fire source is above 80 °C, fire source of wet bench (6 m length) did 
not influence occupants to evacuate.  
The FDS smoke layer interface is determined by the N-percentage rule and the 
corresponding value of N is chosen as 80, recommended by NFPA 92B (suggesting 
N=80–90). The smoke descending time was 317 sec and 312 sec at scenario 1 and scenario 2, 
respectively. 
B. Trial smoke management design 2 
Trial design 2, including scenarios 3 and 4, selected a significantly stronger fire of 5.4 MW in 
HRR and the fire-origin source is situated in Zone 3. A fire was started at the center of the 
wet bench by simulation when t=0, and the ambient temperature was fixed at 24 °C. The 
air-conditioning continued to operate normally, and the smoke exhaust system was closed 
after the fire. The FFU in the fire zone closed in S3 and decreased to 0.1 m s－1 in S4, and 
those in the other zones increased to 0.6 m s－1. The smoke particles were found to be 
restricted to the fire-origin zone when the upward smoke exhaust system was manually 
activated 30 sec later. At t=110 sec, the smoke particles were brought downward near the 
smoke exhaust vent. The smoke particles were almost completely extracted by the smoke 
exhaust system. 
According to simulation results, the highest temperature at 1.8 m height next to 5.5 m 
from center was less than 26 °C (see Fig. 17), which is still below the unattainable one of 80 
°C. The highest CO concentration at 1.8 m height next to 5.5 m from center was less than 
0.01 ppm (see Fig. 18), which is still below the unattainable one of 1,400 ppm. Apparently, 
 10 
design fires were 3 MW and 5.4 MW. Both smoke exhaust systems met the performance 
criteria. However, the downward smoke exhaust system can still be utilized, provided there 
was full compliance with various restrictions in the fire protection design, for example the 
materials used and the acceptable emergency plan. Although the downward smoke exhaust 
system cannot completely protect assets, the fire scenario (3 MW) reached the life safety 
requirements by using the downward smoke exhaust system. The downward smoke exhaust 
system thus met the local fire code requirements, but insurance companies did not necessarily 
agree with the fire protection system. 
Regarding occupant evacuation, the simulation results of SIMULEX shows total 
evacuation time of 198 and 262 sec. FDS simulations with smoke curtain installation 
confirmed that the evacuation time was less than the smoke descending time, indicating that 
the occupants can evacuate safely. Consequently, several recommendations were proposed for 
local fire codes: 
(1) The prescriptive regulations were essentially considered the minimum requirements for 
fire safety. Unfortunately, most of these regulations cannot quantify safety criteria of the 
unique 3-level cleanroom. Therefore, occupant evacuation time using the criterion, where 
the evacuation was completed before the time of smoke layer descending to 1.8 m, may 
serve as a safe quantity for life safety. 
(2) In life safety, both downward smoke exhaust system and upward smoke exhaust system 
could be utilized in cleanroom, according to the simulation results of performance-based 
design. 
(3) In view of property protection, insurance companies generally required significantly 
higher standards of property protection. Hi-tech facilities should consider smoke damage 
as the first priority in the cleanroom, rather than life safety criteria in the fire-origin 
compartment. 
(4) For 3 MW or more HRR, smoke was hardly controlled by any smoke exhaust systems in a 
cleanroom without sprinklers. Therefore, wet pipe sprinkler system with a smaller RTI 
value was also a key factor influencing smoke spread.  
(5) In view of loss prevention, local fire authorities should establish a special fire code, 
similar to UFC Article 51 [20] combining performance-based simulation assessment, 
suitable for fire safety requirements for hi-tech plants.

resins to promote physical properties in decorations, architectural, materials, electronics, electrical 
insulators, plastic foams, footwear, composite, parts, and so on [7]. 
The purpose of this study was to determine the thermal runaway reaction of CHP, BPO, and 
DCPO that were mixed with acids and alkalis in the petrochemical process. We used differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the fundamental thermokinetic data and the essential safety 
parameters, such as exothermic onset temperature (T0), peak temperature (Tmax), and enthalpy (△
Hd), were obtained by calorimetry [8]. We employed the thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) to 
detect decomposition phenomena during storage or transportation under isothermal condition which 
has been extensively applied to evaluate incompatible as effects received thermokinetic data, such as 
time to maximum rate (TMRiso), the highest heat flow, and reaction time [9, 10]. According to the 
UN suggestions, vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) was applied to investigate and evaluate the 
thermokinetics, such as maximum temperature rise ((dT dt–1)max), and maximum pressure rise ((dP 
dt–1)max) and so on [11]. 
Finally, we confirmed the decomposition temperature, self-heating rate, and pressure rise rate of 
CHP, BPO, and DCPO at the same times for determining the hazardous characteristics by integrating 
DSC and VSP2 test data. The results of this study were used to provide safety information 
concerning CHP, BPO, and DCPO in the manufacturing process and to establish emergency relief 
systems under an upset situation. 
 
Experimental and methods 
 
Samples 
 
CHP of 80 mass%, a limpid liquid, was purchased from Alfa Aesar. BPO of 75 mass% and DCPO of 
98 mass%, two white crystalline solid substances, were purchased from PRS Panreac and ALDRICH, 
respectively. They were stored in a refrigerator at 4 oC. Experimental techniques, such as preliminary 
estimate, DSC, TAM III, and VSP2, were proposed earlier [12]. 
 
Acid catalyst 
 
Sulfuric acid of 40 mass% strength was procured from Fluka. The sample was diluted by deionized 
water for 1 and 6 N separately. 
 
Alkalines catalyst 
 
Sodium hydroxide of 99 mass% and sodium sulfate of 98 mass% were directly purchased from J. T. 
Baker and Riedel-deHean that were diluted by deionized water for 6 N. 
 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
 
Dynamic scanning experiments were performed on a Mettler TA8000 system coupled with a DSC 
821e measuring test crucible (Mettler ME-26732), which is the essential part of the experiment. It 
was used for carrying out the experiments for withstanding relatively high pressure to approximately 
100 bar. STARe software was used to obtain thermal curves for analysis [13, 14, 15]. The scanning 
rate selected for the temperature–programmed ramp was 4 oC min–1. The range of temperature rise 
was chosen from 30 to 300 oC for CHP, BPO, and DCPO. About 5 mg of the samples which were 
mixed with 2.5 mg of the incompatibilities was used for acquiring the experimental data. The test 
cell was sealed manually by a special tool equipped with Mettler’s DSC. 
 
Thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) 
 
Paper No.: 70, EM/TH Session, Presented at NATAS 2011, Des Moines, Iowa, USA (August 7–10, 2011)  
between adiabatic condition and kinetic screening would cause the effect because the DSC offered 
energy continuously even when the reaction was carried on. On the contrary, the VSP2 stopped 
heating when OPs were decomposed by heat-wait-search test. 
The exothermic behaviors of solid Ops, such as BPO and DCPO, were obvious that self-heating 
rate and pressure rise rate increased in a short time. Tables 2 and 3 list T0, ΔHd, Tmax, Pmax, (dT 
dt–1)max and (dP dt–1)max of BPO and DCPO by DSC and VSP2. Due to the enormous temperature 
and pressure rises by the adiabatic calorimeter, the potential hazard appeared when BPO and DCPO 
began to decompose from solid to liquid under physical transformation. 
 
Conclusions 
From a series of tests, the catalytic reaction of CHP, BPO, and DCPO with added incompatibilities, 
was performed by various tests of thermal decomposition. For the degree of hazard under runaways, 
our results from thermal curves and experimental data provided evidence to show that the degree of 
hazard significantly increased when the CHP, BPO, and DCPO were mixed with acids and alkalines. 
The TMRiso and peak power were used to evaluate the safety parameters which maintained at 
isothermal condition during transportation and storage. By integrating DSC and VSP2 tests, we 
confirmed the decomposition temperature, self-heating rate, and pressure rise rate of the three OPs at 
the same interval for comprehending the hazardous characteristics and information. Future studies 
will focus on the reaction mechanism of CHP, BPO, and DCPO analysis in a batch reactor.

trimethylcyclohexane by DSC and VSP2

Abstract 1,1-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH), like many organic 
peroxides (OPs), is generally employed as a polymerization initiator, and is also used 
comprehensively in the manufacturing process. There are two peroxy groups (–O–O–) in TMCH’s 
structure, so the entropy of TMCH is relatively higher than other OPs. Therefore, TMCH may release 
enormous amounts of energy when it decomposes and may cause serious accidents, including 
runaway reaction, fire, and explosion. The aim of this study was to assess the thermokinetic 
parameters of TMCH, such as exothermic onset temperature (T0), heat of decomposition (ΔHd), 
maximum temperature and pressure (Tmax and Pmax), and other safety parameters by differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP2). ΔHd of TMCH which is detected by 
DSC was 3,090 J g−1, and activation energy (Ea) of different mass% of TMCH, such as 20, 25, and 30 
mass%, were evaluated 166.2, 160.4, and 159.8 kJ mol–1, respectively. Furthermore, we applied 
advanced kinetics and technology solutions (AKTS) to simulate the thermokinetic parameters of 
TMCH. According to the study, we can not only realize the properties and runaway reaction of 
TMCH, but also set a safer design to prevent and mitigate the runaway reaction.

Introduction 
 
During the last few decades, 1,1-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH), like 
many organic peroxides (OPs), has been widely employed as initiator and cross-linking agent for 
polymerization reaction, since it typically forms free radicals upon decomposition [1]. After free 
radicals are formed in the process, it may induce autocatalytic decomposition and then release large 
amounts of thermal energy resulting in high pressure during runaway excursion, leading to fire, 
explosion, or toxic release [2]. In the past several decades, many thermal explosions have been 
caused by OPs in Japan and Taiwan, as shown in Table 1 [3, 4]. The important reason for accidents of 
OPs is due to peroxy group (–O–O–) which is a thermal source of thermal instability and high 
sensitivity, resulting in accidents [5–7]. When encountering thermal sources or high atmospheric 
temperature, OPs can decompose and incur exothermic reactions during preparation, manufacturing, 
transportation, storage, and even disposal [7, 8]. They may cause various hazards, such as fire, 
explosion, toxic release, and other serious destruction of the environment [7–9]. According to thermal 
hazards owing to those dangerous OPs, OPs require inherently safer design in every condition. 
   TMCH is a low-volatility, colorless liquid ketone peroxide that is used as initiator for 
polymerization of styrene, crosslinking agent for polyethylene and elastomers, heat curing agent for 
unsaturated polyester, and silicone rubber. There are two peroxy groups in TMCH’s structure, so 
TMCH may release enormous amounts of heat upon decomposition. TMCH, otherwise, is identified 
as a hazardous chemical under the criteria of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) hazard communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) [10]. Even though TMCH is a 
dangerous material, it is widely employed in the process industries. Consequently, TMCH should be 
conserved carefully during manufacturing, transportation, and storage. There are many studies on 
those dangerous OPs, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKPO), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), 
and dicumyl peroxide (DCPO), but few researches focus on TMCH [11–13]. Therefore, this study 
aimed to assess its thermokinetic parameters, including exothermic onset energy (T0), heat of 
decomposition (ΔHd), maximum temperature and pressure (Tmax and Pmax), and other safety 
parameters by adiabatic calorimeters, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent sizing 
package 2 (VSP2). In this way, we can develop a safer design to prevent and mitigate the runaway 
reaction by those thermokinetic parameters. 
 
Experimental 
 
Samples 
 
Eighty eight mass% TMCH was purchased directly from the ACE Chemical Corp., and then stored in 
a refrigerator at 4 oC. We could calculate the ΔHd of TMCH by DSC at various heating rates, 1, 2, 4, 
and 10 oC min−1. Using 50 mass% ethyl benzene mixed with 50 mass% styrene monomer as a diluted 
solution, 20, 25, and 30 mass% TMCH could be obtained through blending with pure TMCH and

The n of sample can be predicted by using Eqs. 1 and 3. The self-heating rate (dT dt−1) of sample can 
be calculated from VSP2 data, but we do not know the n of the chemical. Therefore, Eq. 4 [17] is 
applied to determine the value of the dT dt−1 using various n values. One can use the predicted data of 
dT dt−1 to fit the experiment of dT dt−1 and to identify the true n of a chemical of interest.

Advanced kinetics-based simulation method-Advanced kinetics and technology solutions (AKTS) 
 
AKTS-Thermokinetics Software Package [18] facilitates kinetic analysis of any type of 
thermoanalytical data (DSC, differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), 
thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS), or thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared 
spectrometer (TG-FTIR)) for the study of raw materials and products within the scope of research, 
development, and quality. If DSC monitors the evolution of the reactions, signals can be used not 
only for qualitative and quantitative analysis but also for kinetic description. The measured data were 
subsequently exported in ASCII format for further thermokinetic interpretation with 
AKTS-Thermokinetics Software. Furthermore, the calculated kinetics parameters are subsequently 
employed to predict the reaction progress of investigated samples under any given temperature mode  
[19–22]. Experiments were performed in gold plated high pressure sealed crucibles at a heating rate 
of 0.5, 1, 2, 2, 4, and 8 oC min−1 (non-isothermal) with a sample masses between 6.66 and 11.28 mg. 
Moreover, reaction rates are the most often considered as a function of only two time-dependent 
variables, temperature T and chemical conversion α (which varies from 0 to 1 from initiation to 
completion). The usual relationship incorporating the Arrhenius expression is Eq. 5. This equation 
relates the dα dt−1 to three distinct kinetic parameters, including the frequency factor A, the Ea, and 
the reaction model f(α). Moreover, this is visible with the most common differential isoconversional 
method of Friedman [23]. Friedman proposes to apply the logarithm of dα dt−1 as a function of the 
reciprocal temperature at any conversion α as shown in Eq. 6.

demonstrate the curve of dT dt−1 and dP dt−1, which depicted enormous variations in temperature or 
pressure, such as (dT dt−1) max and (dP dt−1) max. Furthermore, Ea of 20, 25, and 30 mass% of TMCH 
was 166.2, 160.4, and 159.8 kJ mol–1 as depicted in Table 3. 
 
AKTS simulations 
 
The DSC data were subsequently exported in ASCII format with AKTS-Thermokinetics Software. 
The decomposition of TMCH at various heating rates by AKTS simulations is shown in Figs. 6–10 
which show that there is one peak curve during the decomposition process of TMCH and the heat of 
decomposition is between 1020.7 to 1264.0 J g−1. Moreover, the range of T0 and Tmax was 73.4–92.0 
oC and 123.7–157.2 oC, correspondingly. The different isoconversional results can be applied to 
accurately simulate dα dt−1 and progress α for the decomposition of TMCH at a variety of heating 
rates as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. In addition, by using Eq. 8 one can calculate the dα dt−1 and 
progress α for various scales under any thermal conditions. Figures 13 and 14 depict the Ea of TMCH 
by reaction rate versus T−1 analysis and heating rate versus T−1 analysis, respectively. The heating rate 
progress of TMCH reaction process is shown in Fig. 15, whose slope is a straight line with Ea = 
115.2 kJ mol−1. 
 
Conclusions 
 
A package of thermokinetics parameters, such as T0, Tmax, Pmax, ΔHd, (dT dt−1), and (dP dt−1) could be 
detected by DSC and VSP2, which not only describe the characters of TMCH in decomposition but 
also could apply in the disaster prevention and mitigation of runaway reaction. As far as the degree of 
hazard under runaway reactions, our results of experimental data demonstrated the decomposition of 
TMCH was broadly violent and the degree of hazard was increased when the concentration of 
reactants was enhanced. If higher concentration of TMCH was employed in the chemical 
manufacturing process without proper protections, it would cause violent runaway reactions due to its 
higher degree of (dT dt−1) and (dP dt−1). Therefore, those thermokinetics parameters in the study are 
necessary for safe condition of application during the manufacturing process. Compared to DSC and 
VSP2 tests, we employed AKTS software to simulate the decomposition of TMCH to obtain other 
kinetic parameters by AKTS analysis which could be used in isothermal and non-isothermal 
conditions. In addition, most kinetic parameters analyzed by AKTS software were similar to the 
results calculated by DSC. AKTS simulation can also be applied to predict further thermokinetic 
parameters, such as self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT) and time to maximum rate 
(TMR), which can be used in the critical signal for accidents prevention in the chemical industries.

Evaluation of thermal hazard for lauroyl peroxide by VSP2 and TAM III  
 
Mei-Li You．Chi-Min Shu 
 
Abstract  When above certain temperature limits, lauroyl peroxide (LPO) is an unstable material 
in terms of thermal hazards. If the thermal source cannot be properly governed during any stage in 
the preparation, manufacturing process, storage, or transport, runaway reactions may inevitably be 
induced immediately. In this study, the influence of runaway reactions on its basic thermal 
characteristic was assessed by evaluating kinetic parameters, such as activation energy (Ea) and 
frequency factor (A) by thermal activity monitor III (TAM III). This was achieved under five 
isothermal conditions of 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 oC. Vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) was employed to 
determimne the maximum pressure (Pmax), the maximum temperature (Tmax), the self-heating rate (dT 
dt–1), maximum pressure rise rate ((dP dt–1)max), and adiabatic time to maximum rate ((TMR)ad) under 
the worst case. Results of this study will be provided to relevant plants for adopting best practices in 
emergency response or accident control.

and physical equilibrium. We used the software of TAM III assistant to govern the thermostat. The 
thermostat liquid is mineral oil with a total volume of 22 L, and the temperature range of the 
thermostat is 15–150 °C when mineral oil is employed. 
The thermal power is determined by Eqs. (1)–(3) [5].

Equation (2) indicates the function of reaction rate, and then dC dt−1 is the reaction rate (s−1); k is 
the constant of reaction rate; f(c) is the kinetic function depending on conversions; P is the thermal 
power or heat production rate (W= J s−1); ∆H is the enthalpy change (J g−1). 
 
Adiabatic tests by VSP2 
 
VSP2 manufactured by Fauske & Associates, Inc. [6, 7] was applied to obtain thermokinetic and 
thermal hazard data, such as temperature and pressure traces versus time. A PC-controlled adiabatic 
calorimeter (VSP2), the well- known turn on heat-wait-search (H-W-S) mode for detecting the 
self-heating rate was adopted for VSP2. Under heating conditions, the main heater will turn on to 
heat the sample to the pre-set temperature, then on a guard heater is turned on to sustain in an 
adiabatic environment. Under waiting conditions, stirring will benefit the sample temperature to be 
more uniform. Under searching conditions, it is considered that the reaction has started into the self- 
decomposition reaction as the sample temperature rise rate is more than apparatus sensitivity (0.05 
°C min−1). 
The adiabatic operation allows direct application of the temperature and pressure rise rate data to 
large-scale process vessels. The data are useful for determining the adiabatic heat of reaction, as well 
as the adiabatic reaction rate used for pressure relief system design [8]. 
The low heat capacity of the cell guaranteed that almost all the reaction heat that was released 
remained within the tested sample. Thermokinetic and pressure behaviors in the same test cell (ca. 
112 mL) usually could be tested, without any difficult extrapolation to the process scale due to a low 
thermal inertia factor (Φ) of about 1.05 and 1.32. The low Φ value permits for bench scale simulation 
of the worst credible case, such as cooling failure, external fire conditions, or incorrect dosing. In 
addition, to avoid bursting the test cell and losing all the exothermic data, the VSP2 tests were run 
with low concentration or smaller amount of reactants. Accordingly, VSP2 was used to evaluate the 
essential thermokinetics for LPO.  
 
Result and discussion 
 
Thermal decomposition analysis for TAM III 
 
The reaction curves of LPO under the isothermal conditions were obtained at several temperatures, 
like 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C in TAM III. The reaction occurred in solid state, since no endothermic 
effect was observed at 50 °C. On the 50 °C reaction curve, the obtained data are plotted as shown in 
Fig. 1; at first heat flow increased, and after reaching a summit it decreased. The shape of the 
reaction curves is characteristic of an autocatalytic reaction. These are comprised of two main 
constituents in the thermal decomposition of organic peroxides: (1) homolysis of the O-O bond, and 
(2) radical-induced decomposition [9, 10].  
At 50 °C constant temperature, thermal decomposition of LPO an intermediate radical 
[C11H23COO·] was produced, and thus it triggered off the rate of reaction, as well as heat flow, to 
increase gradually until reaching the summit. During this stage the intermediate radical behaves as 
temperature from VSP2 experimental data for the thermal decomposition 95 mass% LPO is in Fig. 
10. 
According to Figs. 9 and 10, the properties of LPO from solid decomposed to liquid and were 
suddenly transferred to vapor. That likes the under isothermal storage conditions from TAM III: the 
exothermic decomposition reaction of LPO begins in the liquid phase while the liquid and the solid 
phase coexist, and the heat flux from the exothermically decomposing liquid is employed for the 
endothermic melting of the solid, so that the system is maintained under quasi-isothermal conditions 
until the melting is completed [8, 9]. From VSP2 data, the temperature stayed between 48−50 °C 
about 12 min; the system was maintained under quasi-isothermal conditions and then the system 
remained at  self-heating 2 °C min−1 until 60 °C, the system started to self-heat abruptly and ran 
away rapidly [4, 11]. In this connection, the exothermic onset temperature (T0), and TNR were 50 and 
60 °C, respectively. 
 
The calculation of thermokinetic parameters 
 
Thermal hazard investigations are widely used for early stage of prevention in industries and 
laboratories. This study should provide warning information of organic peroxides (OPs) tests by 
various calorimeters. 
If the sensible heat is absorbed by a vessel, it could not be negligible. The energy balance 
equation of the adiabatic reaction system is described as Eq. (6):

Equation 3 could be used to determine the Ea at the same time [19, 20]. The calculated Ea are shown 
in Table 2. 
 
Conclusions 
 
According to the data and evidence collected in this study, under isothermal storage conditions, the 
exothermic decomposition reaction of LPO begins in the liquid phase while the liquid and the solid 
phase coexist. The heat flux from the exothermically decomposing liquid is, in turn, utilized for the 
endothermic melting of the solid, so that the system is maintained under quasi-isothermal conditions 
until the melting is completed. Under isothermal conditions, there was only 3 min to respond when 
the temperature was at 90 °C. In this connection with VSP2, LPO was subjected to an isothermal 
storage test; it started to self-heat abruptly and rapidly, as the maximum self-heating rate dT dt–1max, 
and maximum pressure rise rate dP dt–1)max were 6648 °C min–1, and 495 °C, respectively. 
LPO will not initiate any prominent runaway reaction, unless it undergoes through the melting 
stage under higher temperature, properly maintained at low temperature during transportation and 
storage. In practice, these data are necessary for safe application, storage, and transportation of a 
reactive chemical of interest.

Introduction 
 
Solid organic peroxides (SOPs) are widely used in industrial processes as initiation of 
polymerization, curing or cross linking agents. The decomposition of SOPs by their relatively 
weak oxygen linkage and hydroperoxide radical in the presence of reaction solution is one of 
the thermal reactions to trigger a runaway hazard. The typical decomposition of organic 
peroxides is very complicated as they can readily react under unstable or unfavorable 
condition to court various accidents. The threshold temperatures of many exothermic SOPs 
are below 120 °C and sometimes even as low as ambient temperature [1]. Runaway accidents 
may react on oxidation reactors or storage tanks. 
Lauroyl peroxide (LPO) is a white solid with a soapy fragrance. LPO has a powerful free 
radical source containing more than 4.0 mass% of active oxygen and is applied as a 
polymerization initiator or polymerization catalyst [2]. In practice, it has been used in 
bleaching agent, waxes, and catalyst. It decomposes rapidly, causes fire and explosion hazard, 
upon heating and under influence of light or mixing with incompatible chemical [3]. 
Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a non-toxic, colorless, and tasteless solid that generally 
contains less than 5 mass% or 15–50 mass% water in commercial products, which is widely 
applied in the chemical industry [4]. In essence, BPO is very unstable and degrades to form 
organic acid such as benzoic acid [5]. 
Dicumene peroxide (DCPO) is one of the most applied peroxides in polymers [6]. It is 
broadly employed in cross-linking agent for ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers and 
curing agent for unsaturated polystyrene (PS) [7]. DCPO is also applied to enhance physical 
properties in architectural materials, electronics, and electric insulators [8]. 
  Our aim was to apply differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent sizing package 2 
(VSP2) to confirm the thermokinetic parameters, such as maximum temperature (Tmax), onset 
temperature (T0), temperature of no return (TNR), maximum pressure (Pmax), maximum 
temperature rise ((dT dt –1)max), and maximum pressure rise ((dP dt–1)max). The results could 
provide hazard information about LPO, BPO, and DCPO in the process industries to establish 
a proactive emergency program. 
 
Experimental and method 
 
Samples 
 
As listed in Table 1, three solid organic peroxides, LPO, BPO, and DCPO, were selected for 
this study. The experimental samples were LPO of 95 mass%, BPO of 75 mass%, and DCPO 
of 98 mass%, which appeared as white crystalline solid and were stored in a refrigerator at 4 
oC. The experimental method, such as preparatory estimate, DSC, and VSP2, was proposed 
The initially exothermal T0, Tmax, ∆Hd of LPO, BPO, and DCPO with H2SO4 or NaOH were 
obtained by DSC. The scanned results are in Figs.1–3 and Tables 1–3. 
The heat release rate vs. temperature for the thermal decomposition of 98 mass% LPO 
mixed with H2SO4 or NaOH is summarized in Fig. 1. The T0 and ∆Hd are reported in Table 1. 
Figure 1 shows the typical heat flow curves vs. temperature for the thermal decomposition 
of 98 mass% LPO in H2SO4 or NaOH. Instead of severe exothermal reaction, when LPO was 
mixed with H2SO4 or NaOH, the results indicated that all exothermal peaks were mild. 
However, as likely the LPO mixed with H2SO4, that T0 occurred earlier than LPO mixed with 
NaOH, as presented in Table 1. Therefore, the hazards incurred by LPO mixed with H2SO4 
would be more dangerous than others. 
 
To investigate the thermal decomposition hazard of 75 mass% BPO, DSC at 4 oC min–1 
heating rate was applied to determine the hazard information, as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2. 
The BPO exothermal results are given in Table 2. According to the results of the DSC tests, 
BPO mixed with H2SO4 revealed that BPO will be more dangerous and unstable because of 
H2SO4, which will exacerbate the thermal hazard and ∆Hd, as determined to be ca. 1,229 J g–
1. 
 
To evaluate the thermal hazard of 98 mass% DCPO, DSC at 4 oC min–1 of heating rate was 
applied to acquire thermal hazard information, as displayed in Table 3 and Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, 
DCPO decomposed reaction was at ca. 112 oC. The thermokinetic parameters of 98 mass% 
DCPO are presented in Table 3. T0 of DCPO mixed with incompatibilities solutions showed 
that exothermal reaction was determined to be about 911, 850, and 863 J g–1, respectively, for 
DCPO, DCPO mixed with H2SO4, and DCPO mixed with NaOH. 
 
Thermal analysis by VSP2 tests 
 
This study attempted to partially validate the similarity of DSC results by VSP2. Furthermore, 
we could understand the thermal hazard phenomena, when the runaway reaction increased or 
reduced the disasters potential. 
  Table 4 lists the thermal parameters T0, Tmax, maximum pressure (Pmax), ((dT dt –1)max), and 
((dP dt –1)max) of 98 mass% LPO by VSP2. Figs. 4 to 7 show the thermal decomposition of 98 
mass% LPO mixed with H2SO4 or NaOH by VSP2. When LPO was mixed with 
incompatibilities in solutions, LPO demonstrated greater degree of thermal hazard and 
instability, and the rate of temperature increase in temperature and pressure happened earlier 
than LPO alone. 
 
Table 5 lists the thermal parameters of 98 mass% BPO and BPO mixed with 6 N H2SO4 or

Introduction 
 
In the past, incidental thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) has resulted in hazardous 
and dreadful thermal explosions, often due to mishandling. Loss of property, not to mention human 
casualties, has reached upward of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. A few such BPO thermal 
hazard events are shown in Table 1 [1–3]. The purpose of this investigation was to consider, by 
means of analysis of thermokinetic data, the runaway thermal behaviors of BPO which cannot be 
found in standard material safety data sheet (MSDS). In this study, differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) were employed to calculate safety parameters and 
thermokinetics, and simulations using optimal fit approach were compared with experimental data. 
The results rendered parameters for industrial production, storage, or transportation, fire prevention, 
and for mitigating thermal damage of BPO explosion in engineering processes during upsets. 
 
Experimental methods 
 
BPO is a non-toxic, colorless, odorless, and tasteless crystalline solid. In addition to industrial use, it 
is applied to one’s skin in the treatment of acne. As such, products containing BPO are easily 
accessible over the counter. It is, therefore, of commercial importance to recognize problems

where Ea is received from the slope of the plot of log βi against Tmax–1. The value of Ea as calculated 
in this way is presented in Table 2. 
 
Vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) 
 
Vent sizing package 2 (VSP2), a PC-controlled adiabatic calorimeter developed and manufactured by 
Fauske & Associates, LLC (FAI) [14], was employed to obtain thermokinetic and thermal hazard 
data, such as temperature and pressure traces vs. time. The low heat capacity of the cell guarantees 
that all the reaction heat released remained within the tested sample. Thermokinetic and pressure 
behavior can usually be examined in the same test cell (116 mL) without any difficult extrapolation 
on the process scale, due to the low thermal inertia factor (ϕ) of about 1.05 to 1.32 [15]. VSP2 can be 
used to measure temperature ranges from ambient temperature to 400 °C at a maximum detectable 
sensitivity of 0.02 °C min–1 [16]. 
Thermal runaway tests were executed by adiabatic calorimeter using test cells with lower heat 
capacity to acquire the rate of pressure increase and self-heating rate traces vs. temperature. Small 
values of ϕ bring the experimental conditions close to true process conditions and simplify 
extrapolation of reaction hazards. Following the dynamic scanning tests, the experimental results of 
BPO 20 mass%, using heat–wait–search (H-W-S) procedure in VSP2, demonstrated an initial 
self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT) of about 125 oC, and a maximum self-heating 
rate and a maximum rate of pressure increase of 2.7 °C min–1 and 10.19 psig min–1, respectively [16].  
For 75 mass% of BPO dissolved into toluene solution, VSP2 was used for testing 20 mass% BPO at 
20, 30, and 40 mL. 
 
Thermal safety software (TSS) 
 
The thermal safety software (TSS) series was employed to evaluate reaction kinetics, to simulate the 
runaway reaction of interest, to allow determination of critical conditions or thermal explosion of the 
tank, and to compute adiabatic derived variables, by taking kinetic and thermodynamic data from a

closely. Additionally, the coefficient of determination (r2) is usually applied in judgment of a 
regression model to evaluate the proportion of total variability in the response accounted for by the 
model, 0≦r2≦1. A value of r2 which is close to 1 demonstrates a linear condition. Applying the 
Kissinger method r2 is 0.85, and by the Ozawa method r2 is 0.86, both representing values of r2 
which are much less than 1. Strictly speaking, the r2 values indicated that both methods did not 
perform as well as expected. The curves for these five coordinate sets should not, therefore, be 
treated as linear conditions, although generally such coordinate curves are taken as linear conditions 
in the Kissinger and Ozawa methods. It was for this reason that our study employed VSP2 and TSS 
step to mimic thermal decomposition. A simulated value compared with an experimental value would 
accordingly be available for clearer understanding of the behaviors of BPO thermal decomposition. 
 
Data evaluation by VSP2 
 
Samples of 20, 30, and 40 mL containing 20 mass% BPO were evaluated, and the experimental 
results using VSP2, are listed in Fig. 5, which depicts lnk vs. (1/T) for reaction rate prediction of 20 
mass% BPO at various volumes, and provides Ea , A, and k. 
Ea = 14.923*8.314 = 124 kJ mol–1                                                   (8)

The Ea values by VSP2 test were much closer to Zaman’s studies (2001) than the Ea values 
developed by the Kissinger and/or Ozawa methods. 
 
Data evaluations of TSS 
 
It is necessary to compare experimental values with simulated values, and for that a hierarchical 
group of kinetic models were suggested and studied for simulation of thermal decomposition of BPO.  
Based upon Thermoanalytical Data Processing (TDPro) and Formal Kinetics (ForK) software of the 
related kinetic parameters and their significance have also been estimated and elucidated [18].  
This study collected the data in Figs. 6 and 7 to generate Table 3 (which shows the 
thermokinetic parameters assessed for BPO by nth order simulation), and the data in Figs. 8 and 9 to 
generate Table 4 (which displays the thermokinetic parameters appraised for BPO by autocatalytic 
simulation).  Figure 6 shows heat production rate vs. time of nth order simulation by ForK and Fig. 
7 shows heat production vs. time of nth order simulation by ForK. Generally speaking, neither the 
values of simulation nor experimentation are in a fair fit for BPO-30-300-0.5 oC min–1, which 
demonstrates that BPO decomposition at a low heating rate of around 0.5 oC min–1 may not undergo 
nth order reaction. Figure 8 shows heat production rate vs. time of autocatalytic simulation by ForK 
and Fig. 9 illustrates heat production vs. time of autocatalytic simulation by ForK. Both values of

Product analysis at the upper explosion limit of methyl 
formate–air–steam mixtures 
 
Shang-Yi Shen．Nung-Kai Lin．Chan-Cheng Chen．Horng-Jang Liaw．Chi-Min Shu 
 
Abstract  As far as process loss prevention is concerned, the explosion limit is very important information for 
chemical industries handle flammable vapors and gases. In our previous studies, the upper explosion limit (UEL) and 
lower explosion limit (LEL) had a theoretical model between the explosion limits and the molar fraction of methyl 
formate diluted with inert steam. Our study found a difference between the amounts of products of carbon monoxide 
(CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on the UEL around the inertization point. The previous results showed that combustion 
products transferred from CO into CO2 should not be ignored in UEL. The experimental works measured the UELs of 
methyl formate diluted with steam at 101 kPa and 423 K by a 20-L-Apparatus. The combustion products were tested 
and analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer.

Methods, procedures, and parameters 
20-L-Apparatus 
 
The flammability limits (explosion limits) were investigated by a 20-L-Apparatus (20-L spherical 
explosion vessel). It was manufactured by Adolf Kühner AG (Switzerland) [9]. The test chamber is 
a stainless steel hollow sphere with a personal computer interface. The top of the cover includes 
holes for the lead wires to the ignition system. The opening provides for ignition by a condenser 
discharging with an auxiliary spark gap, which is by default, mastered by a KSEP 320 unit of the 
20-L-Apparatus [10]. The KSEP 332 unit uses piezoelectric pressure sensors to take the pressure as 
function of time [11]. A comprehensive software package KSEP 6.0 was available, which allowed 
safe operation of the test equipment and an optimal evaluation of the explosion test results [12]. 
In this study, the experimental procedure complied with the ASTM E 681-04 [5], E 918-83 [13], 
and E 2079 [14]. The experiments were divided into three procedures illustrated by the following: 
1. According to ASTM E 681-04, the system is exhausted and drained with air to ensure removal 
of residual volatile materials that may be present as a result of cleaning or prior tests. Between 
tests, more than three times flush cycles may be necessary to warrant removal combustion 
products completely. 
2. The fuel is added prior to inerting, and then air is introduced in vessel until reach initial 
condition (101 kPa). 
3. Finally, we should decide whether or not an explosion happens at this specific composition. 
According to E 918-83, a pressure rise greater than or equal 7 vol% of the initial test pressure is 
taken to be explosive. Moreover, the provided ignition energy of about 10 J by E 2079 criterion 
was recommended. 
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set-up and the corresponding control 
system which was purchased from Adolf Kühner AG [15]. 
 
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer 
 
The products of combustion were qualitatively analyzed by FT-IR. Figure 2 shows the outward 
appearance of FT-IR. We attempted to know the effects of combustion reaction mechanism by 
different inerting concentrations. In preliminary study, we tried to find the reasons for the bias that 
compared with theory by the different theoretical assumptions. FT-IR has been extensively 
employed to execute qualitative and quantitative analyses.  
There are two clear advantages to using FT-IR: non-destructive and high selective. Moreover, 
FT-IR has even more of the following advantages over traditional IR: 
1. The export energy is prominently large. 
2. The precision of frequency is very high [16]. 
3. The time of spectrum scanning is short.

Abstract Possessing thermal instability inherently, organic peroxides (OPs) have caused many 
severe accidents in chemical industries all over the world. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) is 
usually used as initiator or oxidant because of its strong oxidizing ability in the chemical process. In 
this study, the thermal hazard analysis of TBHP mixed with various acids was investigated. 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) were used to figure 
out the thermal runaway behaviors of TBHP. Thermokinetic parameters, such as exothermic onset 
temperature (T0), maximum temperature (Tmax), and enthalpy (ΔH), were obtained from thermal 
curves. In addition, the activation energy (Ea) and rate constant (k) were calculated by the Arrhenius 
equation. As far as loss prevention is concerned, thermokinetic parameters are crucial to the relevant 
processes in the chemical industries, particularly under process upsets.

Introduction 
 
Organic peroxides (OPs) have caused severe explosion for many years in Asia. They can generate 
tremendous amounts of thermal energy with high pressure during runaway excursion, leading to fire, 
explosion, or toxic release which would be a great impact on the environment [1–12]. Some selected 
incidents of thermal explosions caused by peroxides in Asia are shown in Table 1 [6–9]. OPs are 
mostly employed as catalysts and promoters that accelerate decomposition reaction in the 
petrochemical industries. They usually apply to initiation of free radical polymerization and use as a 
curing agent in chemical process. Hydroperoxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, cumene 
hydroperoxide (CHP), and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP, (CH3)3COOH) are extremely sensitive 
to thermal sources and are incompatible with impurities [13]. The thermal decomposition of OPs 
makes progress because of their unstable peroxy bonds (–O–O–), which is a weak bond and could be 
broken readily, leading to a thermal explosion or runaway reaction if the reaction is out of control. 
The various thermal hazards of OPs require that such chemicals be handled and stored with adequate 
safety handling in the industries. TBHP is a volatile, yellowish liquid, and alkyl hydroperoxide 
normally used as an initiator for polymerization of acrylic emulsion. It is widely used as raw material 
for chemical synthesis, a curing agent, or a free radical initiator for polymerization of acrylates, 
acrylic resins, engineering plastics, etc. in the petrochemical industries. Commercially, TBHP is 
mostly composed of aqueous solution of 70 mass% TBHP and 30 mass% water. Thermal runaway 
reactions associated with exothermic behaviors of TBHP solutions and TBHP reacting with alkaline 
contaminants (KOH, NaOH, LiOH, and NH4OH) were studied by Wang [14]. 
OPs have thermally unstable properties and the reaction of self-accelerating decomposition 
follows in a reactor or storage vessel. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 
432, the Code for the Storage of Organic Peroxide Formulations and, defining safe storage and fire 
fighting methods for OPs, has regulated the quantity, conditions for storage, solvents for dilution, 
and material for packaging, and has described the types of hazards of commercial OPs. TBHP is 
given a hazard classification as a reactivity type by the NFPA [15]. This study tried to find out the 
hazardous properties of TBHP solution mixed with various acids under thermal decomposition by 
calorimetric methodology, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent sizing 
package 2 (VSP2), which are small-scale tests and are necessary and mandatory for loss prevention 
and damage control. These calorimetric methods were utilized to estimate the actual self-heating rate 
of OPs because they determine the heat of reaction (ΔH) and the related Arrhenius parameters, such 
as activation energy (Ea), order of reaction (n), rate constant (k), and frequency factor (A) [16–18].  
For safe handling process, transportation, and storage, a better understanding of the basic 
properties of TBHP is of necessity in chemical industries. Results revealed that TBHP mixed with 
the acids could induce exothermic reactions in the experiments. Information with safety for handling 
TBHP adequately and correctly has to be prudently taken into consideration to diminish the extent of 
TBHP hazard in chemical process.  
 
 
Abstract ID: 56, EM/TH Session, Presented at NATAS 2011, Des Moines, Iowa, USA (August 7–10, 2011) 
the VSP2 experiments, 15 mass% TBHP was deliberately selected as the concentration. A 20 mL 
TBHP sample was injected into a stainless steel 316 cylindrical test cell with various acids of 4 mL. 
A standard heat-wait-search (HWS) procedure was followed to carry out the adiabatic runaway test 
and the temperature range was from 30 to 400 °C. For a runaway reaction, overpressure in a vessel is 
normally coming from the heat generation of reaction, which is common phenomenon for the 
energetic chemicals such as unstable OPs. The severity of a runaway is usually ranked by the 
self-heating rate, heat of decomposition, or pressure rise rate while the reaction takes place in a 
conceived chemical process.  
 
Thermal Safety Software (TSS) 
 
The thermal safety software (TSS) series was utilized to assess reaction kinetics, to simulate the 
runaway reaction of interest [24]. It allows to determine the critical conditions or thermal explosion 
and to figure out adiabatic behavior of a tank. The TSS software, including ADPro, TDPro, and ForK, 
was utilized to simulate the experimental results for thermal aging, thermal stability, runaway, and 
thermal explosion by taking the data from the DSC and VSP2 experiments. These simulative data 
were necessary for proper choice of safe conditions in application, such as storage and transportation, 
specifically for an energetic chemical of interest.

Conclusions 
 
This study, by calorimetric methodology (DSC and VSP2), found out the hazardous properties of 
TBHP solution mixed with various acids under thermal decomposition during handling process, 
transportation, and storage. The hazardous properties of TBHP are of importance for operators in 
chemical industries. Results revealed that TBHP mixed with the acids could induce exothermic 
reactions in the experiments. In this study, a kinetics-based simulation is valuable for assessing the 
hazard of the organic peroxide. In practice, numerical simulation is a unique way to figure out the 
thermal hazards of reactive chemicals. The relevant accidents incurred by OPs happened recurrently. 
The operator in chemical industries should know better. If an operator does not concern about the 
energetic materials, the trouble would be in brewing. The undesirable and unaccepted results, 
runaway reaction and thermal explosion, could be real. 
The results are vital for the relevant chemical processes in industries. If the relevant process is not 
well under control, not only TBHP itself is a dangerous chemical substance, but the strictly thermal 
hazard would be also a nightmare in industries while TBHP mixed with acids. Therefore, information 
with safety for handling TBHP adequately and correctly in chemical process has to be prudently 
taken into consideration to diminish the extent of TBHP’s hazard. If not properly treated, a heavy 
price could be paid in the chemical industries.

Abstract Lauroyl peroxide (LPO) possesses exothermic features even in a low 
temperature environment. During storage and transportation, it should be sustained at low 
temperature and away from contaminants. LPO is characterized by the presence of a 
sensitive -O-O- bond. In particular, contact with alkalis, acids, heavy metals, reducing 
agents, and any rust should be avoided. The reactivities or incompatibilities of LPO with 
inorganic acids (HNO3, HCl, H3PO4, and H2SO4) and base (NaOH) were assessed by 
thermal activity monitor III (TAM III). Parameters obtained by the above-mentioned 
devices could be readily employed to determine the runaway reaction under isothermal 
condition. Inorganic acid or base elevates the heat of reaction and also decreases the time 
to maximum rate under isothermal condition (TMRiso) while mixed with pure LPO. 
Among the thermal hazards of LPO mixed with NaOH or inorganic acids, LPO mixed 
with NaOH is more dangerous than LPO mixed with inorganic acids.

Experimental design and steps 
 
Standard samples  
 
Ninety-five mass% LPO was directly purchased from the Fluka Co., and both density and 
concentration were measured; then LPO was stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.  
 
Standard procedure for preparation of sample 
Four types of commonly used inorganic acids and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were 
selected to combine with LPO in this study to study its incompatible reactions, such as 
HCl (6 N), HNO3 (1, 6, 12 N), H3PO4 (6 N), H2SO4 (1, 6 N), and NaOH (6 N), as the 
contaminants of interest. The original concentrations of H2SO4, HNO3, HCl, and H3PO4 
were 96, 65, 37, and 85 mass%, separately, and then distilled water was used as the 
thinner for allocating the above-mentioned concentrations. HCl and H3PO4 were acquired 
from Baker in USA directly; H2SO4 had been purchased from Katayama Chemical Co., 
Ltd. in Japan; and HNO3 and NaOH were from Hayashi pure chemical Ind., Co., Ltd. in 
Japan. Deionized water (H2O) was used as the diluent in preparing contaminants, which 
was selected to combine with LPO in this study for studying its incompatible reactions by 
TAM III.  
 
Isothermal tests by thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) 
 
Isothermal microcalorimetry (TAM III) represents a range of products for thermal 
measurements originally manufactured by Thermometric in Sweden. TAM III was used 
to investigate the runaway reaction of LPO mixed with inorganic acid and NaOH under 
temperatures of 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C; absolute temperature could be adjusted to within 
0.02 K, while operating in isothermal mode. The bath mean temperature fluctuations 
were within 10
−5
 K. A maximum scanning rate is ±2 K hr
–1
 for nearly chemical and 
physical equilibrium. We used the software of TAM III assistant to govern the thermostat. 
The thermostat liquid was mineral oil with a total volume of 22 L, and the temperature 
range of the thermostat was 15–150 °C when mineral oil was employed. 
This study investigated LPO mixed with inorganic acid and NaOH solution in 
isothermal conditions. Under the isothermal conditions, a series of LPO homolytic 
scissions were carried out, and the reaction and thermal decomposition of LPO 
individually mixed with inorganic acids and NaOH solution were confirmed completely. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
Thermal decomposition analysis of LPO mixed with inorganic acid by TAM III 
 
A few methods can be utilized to test the runaway reactions and calculate the kinetic 
parameters, such as frequency factor (A), apparent activation energy (Ea), and reaction 
order (n), by calorimeters. Designing a suitable vessel and realizing the basic 
characteristics of a runaway reaction, such as kinetic and safety parameters (time to 
maximum rate, self-accelerating decomposition temperature) for LPO, are often a 
common way of reducing the consequences associated with the above risks in an 
5 
 
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base, alkaline in solution, highly corrosive, and 
incompatible with high concentration acids. Pure NaOH can be diluted with water, and its 
corrosive properties are neutralized if mixed with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid. 
NaOH is stable in its crystal form, but may pull water and carbon dioxide from the air to 
form sodium carbonate if left exposed. As an incident case, LPO was synthesized by the 
reaction of phosphorus trichloride and lauroyl acid. Then it was oxidized by a toluene 
solution of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide to generate LPO. Hence, NaOH 
was used to neutralize the acid residue. 
In Tables 1–4, depending on the operating conditions, when LPO was mixed with 
NaOH, the degree of hazard increased with lower apparent Ea. Figures 5 and 6 indicate 
that when the temperature was increased from 50, 60, and 70 to 80 °C, the reaction time 
for decomposition was significantly decreased. 
The exothermic peak corresponding to LPO decomposition was altered when NaOH 
was present. As reflected in Figs. 4–6, when a sample was fed into the instrument under 
the isothermal conditions, an exothermal reaction began immediately. TMRiso of LPO 
mixed with 6 N NaOH at 50 °C was 7.94 hr, but when the temperature was under 60, 70, 
and 80 °C only 8 minutes to respond. The presence of NaOH leads to a reduced T0 for 
LPO decomposition and the nature of decomposition is altered as evidenced by double 
exothermic peaks in the TAM III trace. In the first peak, mixed with alkaline solutions 
containing hydroxide ions, the strong alkaline led the exthermic onset temperature to be 
significantly reduced even to being impending near the ambient conditions. This study 
confirmed that LPO mixed with NaOH is even more dangerous than LPO alone. 
Compared with inorganic acid (HNO3, etc.) and base (NaOH), in spite of inorganic acids 
emitting a large quantity of heat, the safety parameter TMRiso of a base is faster than that 
of inorganic acids.  
 
The calculation of thermokinetic parameters 
 
The results of Ea for LPO and with inorganic acid and base [15–17] by employing the 
Arrhenius equation, are as shown in eq. (1) [8, 18, 19]:

As the plot of lnk vs. 1/T is expected to be a straight line, the Arrhenius kinetic 
parameters, Ea can be calculated from the plot accordingly. Calculated from Arrhenius 
equation, the value of Ea is 92.3 kJ mol

 at 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C heat powers for pure 
LPO mixed with inorganic acid and NaOH. The Ea was about 67.54 kJ mol

 for LPO 
mixed with 6 N NaOH. The Ea of LPO mixed with the other contaminants is presented in 
Table 5. When LPO was mixed with NaOH, the T0 was lower and reactions became more 
complex than those associated with assessment of the decomposition of the pure OPs. 
Under a lower isothermal temperature, it is possible to observe runaway reactions, as

Thermal hazards evaluation of 1,1-Bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane mixed with 
inorganic acids by DSC and TAM III 
 
Wei-Chun Chen．Wei-Ting Chen． Chi-Min Shu 
 
 
Abstract  1,1-Bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH) is a peroxide with two peroxy groups that 
may explode due to mixing with inorganic acids, such as HCl, HNO3, H2SO4. or H3PO4. In this study, reactivities of 
TMCH mixed with the above inorganic acids were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore, 
parameters obtained by DSC, such as exothermic onset temperature (T0), maximum temperature (Tmax), and heat of 
decomposition (ΔHd) could be employed to acquire safety parameters. Moreover, thermal activity monitor III (TAM 
III), was used to investigate the thermal hazards while storing TMCH and TMCH mixed with four types of commonly 
used inorganic acids, such as HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, or H3PO4 under isothermal conditions. Mixing TMCH with those 
inorganic acids resulted in higherΔHd except H3PO4, and mixing TMCH with HCl clearly decreased T0. Therefore, the 
phenomenon of mixing those incompatible materials with TMCH can be concluded as the worst cases in terms of 
contamination hazards during storage and transportation of TMCH.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
 
Temperature-programmed screening experiments were performed on a Mettler TA8000 system 
coupled with a DSC821e measuring cell [11, 12]. The DSC results showed the profiles of heat flow 
versus temperature that the reference sample and the target sample are heated at the same time. The 
temperature between the reference sample and the target sample is different because the target sample 
releases energy during thermal decomposition and it, in turn, results in heat generation in the cell. 
Therefore, the temperature in the reference sample’s cell and target sample’s cell was not maintained 
equally after the heating test. The system of programmable temperature control was applied in DSC, 
which is used to acquire the various heating and cooling rates from 0.01 to 100 oC and detect the 
range of temperature of target sample from –150 to 700 oC. For a better equilibrium, the heating rate 
in this study was set at 4 oC min–1, and the range of temperature rise was chosen from 30 to 300 oC. 
 
Thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) 
 
Isothermal calorimetry, TAM III, is a highly thermally sensitive and stability detecting equipment. It 
is easy to operate and only requires few samples during the detecting process. Accordingly, TAM III 
is broadly applied in many areas, such as pharmaceutical science, material science, life science, 
chemistry, and physical chemistry [13–15]. The liquid in TAM III’s thermostat was mineral oil, 
which is in a reactor with a total volume of 22 liter (L), and the maximum heating rate of TAM III 
was ±2 K h–1 for usage of chemical and physical equilibrium. The temperatures were set at 15–150 
oC, and then the decomposition of sample was measured by TAM III under isothermal condition. The 
software of TAM III was furthermore employed to master the thermostat and to calculate some 
thermokinetic parameters [16, 17]. The aim of this study was to use TAM III to determine the thermal 
decomposition reactions of 88 mass% TMCH and 88 mass% TMCH individually mixed with 6 N 
HCl, 6 N HNO3, 6 N H2SO4, or 6 N H3PO4, in which the amount of the sample in a cell was 100 mg 
TMCH mixing with 10 mg HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, or H3PO4 at 60, 70, 80, and 90 oC.   
 
Results and discussion 
 
Thermal analysis of DSC 
 
The DSC results were detected by DSC 821e with thermal spectrum analysis including heating and 
temperature conditions, showing heat release or heat decomposition, starting temperature, or the 
dynamics calculations. Figure 1 shows the thermal curve of TMCH with or without inorganic acids, 
and it is one exothermic peak while TMCH is decomposing. The results of TMCH with inorganic 
acids which were used as the contaminants are displayed in Table 1. It caused the T0  to emerge 
earlier while TMCH mixed with HCl, especially, and not only did the T0 occur earlier but also it 
created a severe thermal reaction, causing high temperature when TMCH was mixed with H2SO4. In 
J Therm Anal Calorim (2011) 
5 
 
due to decomposition mechanisms. The higher maximum heat flow and temperature could cause 
runway excursions, and HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 could be classified as incompatible substances 
because TMCH mixed with those inorganic acids may result in TMRiso being diminished.  
Table 6 presents the estimated results of activation energy of TMCH mixed with H3PO4 by using 
the Arrhenius equation, as shown in Eq. (1): 
 
where A, Ea, and R represent the means frequency factor, the activation energy of the stage, and the 
gas constant, individually. The Ea of pure TMCH and TMCH mixed with H3PO4 was 147.37, and 
133.34 kJ mol–1, respectively. When TMCH was mixed H3PO4, its Ea was lower than pure TMCH, 
indicating that a reaction could occur easily.  
 
Conclusions 
 
The thermal analysis technique is very important in the chemical industry for assessing the hazard 
influence during the whole range of the manufacturing process. The inherent thermal hazard 
characteristics of TMCH and TMCH mixed with HCl, HNO3, H2SO4 or H3PO4, were completely 
described in the results and discussion, which depicted the thermokinetic parameters of TMCH and 
TMCH with inorganic acids. It significantly changed not only the original reaction but also the 
TMRiso of TMCH while TMCH was mixed with HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, or H3PO4. When TMCH is 
mixed with HCl, it may generate high heat flow and has a potential second hazard because it forms 
two prominent peaks during decomposition reaction. Therefore, the related safety parameters 
assessed by DSC and TAM III could be applied in the prevention of runaway reaction of TMCH. 
Furthermore, we can employ chromatography instruments, such as high performance liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometer (HPLC–MS), gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC–MS), 
thermogravimetric analyzer/GC–mass spectrometer (TGA–MS) coupled with Fourier transform 
infrared (FT–IR) to determine the decomposition mechanism of TMCH as well as mixed with 
incompatibles, here HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4.
