Abstract
In a WiMAX system, users typically do not stay in fixed locations. They can move
freely so the base stations providing connection service are changed sometimes. An
efficient and fault-tolerant scheme for supporting services is thus necessary. This report
describes distributed P2P-based IPTV mechanism for scalable video streaming service
in WiMAX systems. The mechanism can automatically schedule some nodes (seeds)
that help for transmission based on the current topology. The mechanism is also able to
reconstruct connections if handoff or node failure occurs. The IPTV mechanism has been
evaluated using NS-2 simulator. The results show that both quality of video streaming
and system reliability are improved.

Introduction
WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), which is based on IEEE
802.16 standard, combines with all advantages of Wi-Fi [1] and 3G [2] systems. WiMAX
provides larger transmission ranges and higher bandwidth. In the IEEE 802.16e-2005,
the maximum transmission range is 5km and the bandwidth is 15Mbps. It is apparently
suitable to achieve multi-media service. The deployment cost of the base stations of
WiMAX can be less than Wi-Fi. Figure 1.1 shows that WiMAX has more mobility than
WLAN and more data rate than 2G or 3G.
Streaming systems in wired networks, such as the video-on-demand (VoD) system [3–
5], employ a content distribution network. A main server looks for the nearest edge server
for providing service when a user has a request. This system is not only scalable but
stable since the user does not move. However, in WiMAX networks, users can travel and
also pull streams from a remote server directly. Without an appropriate design, if there
are numerous users, the server will endure huge loads and waste bandwidth.
1
• No extra infrastructure: The scheme provided a system without any extra infras-
tructure. The original WiMAX equipment can support this mechanism.
• Reduce the loading of content server: Because of the seeds in base station groups
would help forwarding descriptions, the content server does not need to equip with
lots of bandwidth.
• High scalability: If any user wants to join this system and he is in one of the base
station groups, he just needs to know the multicast IP, and then he can receive video
stream immediately. However, if the user is not in any base station group, he just
needs to send request to the server, and the server would construct another base
station group for him.
• Fault Tolerance: Any non-seed node failure would not influence the system, since
they do not take charge in any control duty. If seed fails, our scheme provides an
algorithm to make another non-seed node become a new seed.
• Handoff recovery: The seeds would periodically broadcast neighbor information in
its base station group. The neighbor information include the multicast IP, seeds in
the base station group. If any node moves to another base station, it can look up
the information it has received, and listen to the Multicast IP.
The IPTV mechanism for WiMAX has been implemented and evaluated successfully
using ns-2 [9] network simulator. The results show that our scheme achieves good per-
formance in both video quality and resilience to node handoff.

The bandwidth and attributes of WiMAX make it suitable for the following potential
applications:
• Connecting Wi-Fi hotspots with the Internet.
• Providing a wireless solution to cable and xDSL for last mile broadband access.
• Providing data and telecommunications services.
• Providing portable connectivity.
2.2 Previous Works
Some key success factors and challenges for P2P video networks, such as scalability and
quality assurance, were discussed [17]. Economy of the scale is never a problem since
the quality depends on the amount of users. With more clients, the quality is better.
Moreover, the feedback information of the available transmission bandwidth is critical
for the implementation of multiple connections for the scalable video streaming [18].
Both CHUM (Cooperating ad-hoc networking to support messaging) [19, 20] and COS-
MOS (Collaborative Streaming among Mobiles) [21, 22], were designed for wireless P2P
video streaming. CHUM was based on a tree topology with point-to-point communica-
tion; COSMOS utilized a mesh topology with broadcasting.

Chapter 3
Mobility Model
In [31], working in mobile wireless environment, there may be different reasons why a
handoff might be conducted:
• The mobile device may move away from the area covered by one base station and
entering the area covered by another base station, and the connection would be
transferred to the second base station in order to avoid connection interruption
when the mobile device gets outside the range of the first base station.
• When the capacity for a new connection of a given base station is used up and
an existing or new connection from a mobile device, which is located in an area
overlapped by another base station, is transferred to that base station in order to
free-up some capacity in the first base station for other users.
• In non-CDMA networks, when the channel used by the mobile device becomes in-
terfered by another one using the same channel in a different base station, the
connection is transferred to a different channel in the same base station or to a
different channel in another base station in order to avoid the interference.

base station. In this case the connection to the target is established before the connection
to the source is broken, hence this handoff is called make-before-break.
An advantage of the hard handoff is that at any moment in time one user uses only
one channel. The hard handoff event is indeed very short and usually is not perceptible
by the user. Another advantage of the hard handoff is that the client’s hardware does not
need to be capable of receiving two or more channels in parallel, which makes it cheaper
and simpler. A disadvantage is that if a handoff fails, the connection may be temporarily
disrupted or even terminated abnormally.
One advantage of the soft handoffs is that the connection to the source base station
is broken only when a reliable connection to the target base station has been established
and therefore the chances that the client will be terminated abnormally due to a failed
handoff are lower. This advantage comes at the cost of more complex hardware in the
client device, which must be capable of processing several channels in parallel. Because
in a wireless network the majority of the handoffs occur in places of poor coverage, where
the connections would frequently become unreliable when their channel is interfered or

Transmission Mechanism
Our scheme is composed by one central content server, and several base station groups
(BSGs). In Figure 4.1, the system chart is shown as a tree topology, and there are some
seeds and normal nodes in the BSG, where seeds are relatively static and normal nodes
have higher mobility.
4.1 Assumptions
Some assumptions are needed for the IPTV transmission mechanism.
• Location service: Each base station has an unique ID. The ID information can be
accessed by its neighbor base stations. Every client can obtain the IDs for the
connected base station and its neighboring stations. The ISP (Internet Service
Provider) knows all ID information for the base stations.
• Node mobility: Some clients are mobile, such as persons in cars. Some clients are
static. For example, users stay in their home or offices.
11
4.2.2 Seeds
The seeds are responsible to forward video descriptions to other BSGs. Each seed is only
allowed to send one type of description in one time. The seeds need to maintain some
important information, such as the seed lists for self BSG, neighbor BSGs, parent group
BSGp, and grand-parent group BSGgp.
4.2.3 Normal Nodes
Normal nodes have relatively higher mobility so they are not appropriate to do anything
critical. They just listen to the messages broadcasted by seeds and then update the
necessary information.
4.2.4 System Overview
If a node wants to join the P2P system, it will send a request message to the central
content server. The message includes node ID and the located base station number. The
server receives the message and then examines whether the base station has been already
in the system or not. If so, the server notifies the node with the seed list; if not, the node
would be assigned to be a seed, and also a new BSG is created. When the new BSG
is established, the content server will allocate it to a proper position. The server and
BSGs form a tree topology to forward the stream. The content server is the root of the
tree. The server maintains all seed lists in BSGs, so it can evaluate the health status α
for each BSG.

to the server for joining the system. With the procedures, any normal node moves to
another BSG′ does not affect the system since they do not take charge of anything.
On the other hand, if a seed leaves its current BSG, some extra work is needed. All
seeds in the same BSG are required to exchange messages to confirm whether the others
still exist. If any seed fails to send the messages due to failure or handoff, the others will
remove the node from the seed list and notify the server. If the failed seed is in charge of
forwarding stream, the other seeds will take over its job. The leaving seed will become a
normal node unless the destination BSG has α < 0.
Apparently, if there are not enough seeds in BSGp, nodes in BSG would suffer bad
video quality. Our mechanism provides a SWAP mechanism to solving the problem.
In Figure 4.2, BSGC would exchange its position with BSGB in the logical tree. To
perform this operation, the seeds need to maintain two level seed information, including
the parent BSGp and the grand parent BSGgp. The seeds thus need to broadcast the

Chapter 5
Performance Evaluation
In this chapter, the performance of our scheme is simulated using ns-2 simulator with
WiMAX module extension [32]. The main metric to be measured are the quality issue
for each node in average case and in statistic case, and the comparison of seed time and
streaming time.
5.1 Simulation Environment
The parameters used in our evaluations are shown in Table 5.1. The probability M
indicates the moving probability for every node every 10 seconds. The quality is evaluated
by the number of descriptions received for a node. The video frames are generated from
the video source with a constant frame rate. The size of each frame is 600 bytes and the
data of each frame are encoded into n descriptions.
The IEEE 802.16e standard was selected for wireless communication interface. There
are 50 mobile nodes randomly distributed in the 6 km × 6 km area, and the base stations
are uniformly deployed in the field. Each node would move to randomly destination with
17
endure any streaming interruption. When the quality drop, the other nodes can recovery
connection by SWAP or requiring that some normal nodes become seeds to improve the
quality.
The quality for each node in the system operation is also investigated. In Figure 5.2(a),
all nodes have full quality over 80% of time. Some nodes cannot obtain both descriptions
about ten seconds. While M increases, the time when the nodes received less than
two descriptions becomes longer (see Figure 5.2(b)). But the full quality is recovered at
around Time 80. Finally, whenM comes to 70% as shown in Figure 5.2(c), the streaming
quality decreases more. Excess number of the seeds that leaves their BSGs causes the
performance degradation.
The time for serving for a seed for each node is collected; the time for actual streaming
is also measured. The results are displayed in Figure 5.3. The total seed time is decreased
when the mobility probability increases. Handoff events occurs more frequently so even
the nodes with higher mobility have to be seeds. Some seeds do not transmit any de-
scription, because they are in the leaves of the logical tree so there is no child for them
to serve.

Conclusion
This report presents a P2P streaming mechanism for mobile WiMAX networks to reduce
the streaming load for central content server. The mechanism can adapt to the transmis-
sion environment and node mobility. When the video quality in a BSG decreases, the
system will automatically adjust the seed arrangement and BSG structures to achieve
better performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the users can continuously re-
ceive streaming without any disconnection even the mobility probability goes high. The
results confirms that the mechanism has good performance in the WiMAX environment
without any extra infrastructures.
