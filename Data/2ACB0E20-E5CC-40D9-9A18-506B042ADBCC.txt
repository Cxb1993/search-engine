via subroutines 1 and 2 simultaneously. These two faults 
are assumed to occur at right and left sides of the bus M 
(no fault locator), respectively.  
Subroutine 1 – Fault location for the right side of the bus 
M (no fault locator) 
Fault location is assumed to be located on right side of 
bus M at a distance RD [p.u.] away from bus R and 
labeled as F, where subscript R denotes the variables 
defined on right side line of bus M. However, due to the 
uncertainties of bus M, the injection currents from bus M 
are unknown and the transmission line current MRI  on 
right side of bus M are also unknown.  
In the line section between bus M and bus R, the 
unknown variables are currents MRI  and fault location 
RD  (or fault resistance FRR , fault voltage FRV ). Using 
a two-port hyperbolic π-model to represent the line section 
between M and F, the resulting diagram is illustrated in

According the circuit theory and assumption constraint, 
two groups of equations are obtained as follows: 
 Group-1: Network equations 
   0),D,I(F RTR1 =θ  
 Group-2: Constraint equations 
   0),D,I(F RTR2 =θ  
where θ are the known variables, such as RV , LV , MV , 
etc., and MRI , RD  are the unknown variables. 
Croup-1 equations are obtained from the two-ports 
network enclosed by dashed line in Fig.3. Group-2 
equations are obtained from the assumption of pure 
resistance fault impedance. Since the simultaneous 
equations of Group-1 and Group-2 are nonlinear, 
Gauss-Seidel numerical method [13] is needed to find the 
solutions of MRI  and RD . 
The calculating procedures are summarized as follows: 
1. Given an initial value of 1RD  (superscript 1 denotes 
the initial value of the first iteration). 
2. Substitute 1RD  into Group-1 equations to 
calculate 1MRI . 
3. Substitute 1MRI  into Group-2 equations to 
calculate 2RD . 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to calculate the final results of 
MRI  and RD . 
For saving the space, only the three-phase-shorted fault 
is adopted as the example to demonstrate the above 
procedures. Other types of faults can also be easily 
calculated via the proposed procedures. 
Herein, we only use the positive sequence component.

equivalent to that of RRE  in Table I. 
Case 1: Fault occurs at transmission line L (line 2) 
A simple case is used to demonstrate the proposed fault 
location algorithm. Assume that a three-line-to-ground 
fault occurs at 80 km ( LD =0.8 p.u.) of transmission line 2 
away from bus 3. The fault resistance is assumed to be 10Ω. 
The phase of RRE  lags the phase of MME  by 10°.  
The fault location RD  and LD  are computed from 
subroutines one and two simultaneously. Meanwhile, Fig. 5 
plots the estimations of LD . At 2.5 cycles after fault 
inception, the proposed algorithms provide the following 
results. 
Subroutine 1: RD =-8.2181(p.u.), FR =-28.746Ω. 
 Subroutine 2: LD  =0.80052 (p.u.), FR =10.02Ω. 
Since RD  violates the assumption of subroutine 1, the 
correct fault location is easily chosen as LD =0.80052(p.u.) 
(error = 0.052%). 
 
Case 2: Fault occurs at transmission line R  (line 3) 
 Assume that a A-phase-ground fault occurs at 20 km 
( RD =0.2 p.u.) of transmission line 3 away from bus 4. The 
fault resistance is assumed to be 0.1Ω. The phase of RRE  
lags the phase of MME  by 10°. The results of subroutine 
1 and 2 are written as follows: 
 Subroutine 1: RD =0.19999(p.u.), FR =0.1011Ω. 
 Subroutine 2: LD =20.913(p.u.), FR =908.88Ω. 
 Since LD violates the assumption of subroutine 1, 
the correct fault location is easily chosen as 
RD =0.19999(p.u.) (error = 0.001%). Fig. 6 plots the 
estimations of RD . 
 
Load Type Bus M Tests (line 5 and line 6): 
 In the following test cases, subsystem 2 is modeled 
as a load is connected behind the Bus 6. The load 
connected behind the bus M is modeled as 30MW+21MVar 
at nominal voltage. 
 
Case 1: Fault occurs at transmission line L  (line 5) 
 A simple normal case is used to demonstrate the 
proposed fault location algorithm. Assume that a A-phase 
ground fault occurs at 60 km ( LD =0.6 p.u.) of 
transmission line 5 away from bus 6. The fault resistance 
is set as 0.1Ω. The results of subroutine 1 and 2 are 
written as follows: 
 Subroutine 1: RD =-13.207(p.u.), FR =105.27Ω. 
 Subroutine 2: LD = 0.60057(p.u.), 
FR =0.11281Ω. 
 Since RD  violates the assumption of subroutine 1, 
the correct fault location is easily chosen as 
LD =0.60057(p.u.) (error = 0.057%) 
 
Case 2: Fault occurs at transmission line R  (line 6) 
 Assume that a BC-phase-ground fault occurs at a 
30km ( RD = 0.3 p.u.) of transmission line 6 away from 
bus 7. The fault resistance is set as 10Ω. The results of 
subroutine 1 and 2 are written as follows: 
 Subroutine 1: RD =0.30153 (p.u.), FR =9.8985Ω. 
 Subroutine 2: LD =7.0596 (p.u.), FR =-7369.4Ω. 
Since LD violates the assumption of subroutine 1, the 
correct fault location is easily chosen as RD =0.30153(p.u.) 
(error = 0.153%). 
 
Multi-Type Bus M Tests (line 7 and line 8): 
 In the following test cases, subsystem 3 is modeled 
as a generator and load are connected behind the Bus 8. 
The load connected behind the bus M is modeled as 
30MW+21MVar at nominal voltage. A generator is 
modeled as a voltage source MME . The source impedance 
of MME  is equivalent to that of RRE  in Table I. The 
phase of RRE  lags the phase of MME  by 10°. 
 
Case 1: Fault occurs at transmission line L  (line 7) 
 Assume that a AB-phase-short fault occurs at 80 km 
( RD =0.8 p.u.) of transmission line 7 away form bus 8. The 
fault resistance is set as 10Ω. The results of subroutine 1 
and 2 are written as follows: 
 Subroutine 1: RD =0.79841(p.u.), FR =10.117Ω. 
 Subroutine 2: LD = 2.7878(p.u.), FR =4883.5Ω. 
Since LD  violates the assumption of subroutine 2, the 
correct fault location is easily chosen as RD =0.79841(p.u.) 
(error = 0.159%) 
 
Case 2: Fault occurs at transmission line R (line 8)— 
Selector Test 
 A special case is used to demonstrate the accuracy of 
proposed selector. Assume that a three-phase-ground fault 
occurs at 90 km ( RD =0.9 p.u.) of transmission line 8 away 
form bus 4. The fault resistance is assumed to be 10Ω. The 
results of subroutine 1 and 2 are written as follows: 
 Subroutine 1: RD = 0.89749(p.u.), FR = 10.928Ω,
