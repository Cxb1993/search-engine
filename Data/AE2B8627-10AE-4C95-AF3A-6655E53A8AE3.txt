Advanced microelectronic components typically consist of heterogeneous, multilayered layered interconnect 
structures made of metal conductor (Cu, solder) and ceramic or polymer based dielectrics. Dominant failure mode of 
these components is by thermal or mechanical fatigue fracture at interfaces of the layered interconnect structures, 
which are of micron or sub-micron in length scales. Predicting the reliability of the interconnect structure is a 
challenge due to the fact that the materials and associated processes chosen for the dielectrics are new and the 
response of materials interface to cyclic loading is unknown. Approach presently used in the semiconductor and 
microelectronics industry for characterizing interconnect reliability is through either component- or system-level 
accelerated tests. Issues associated with this approach are that the cost is very high and the time needed is too lengthy 
for the required technology development cycle time. Consequently, a phenomenological model that could describe 
the fatigue ruptures of materials interfaces is desired for predicting reliability of interconnects.  
This project focuses on the development of multiscale model to extend fracture mechanics methodology down to 
micron and sub-micron length scales for reliability analysis of microelectronic interconnect structures. Due to the 
drastic change in length scale from the overall component dimension (in the order of millimeter to centimeter) to the 
interface rupture “process zone” (in the order of micron to sub-micron), a multiscale modeling approach is used for 
considering this problem. A continuum theory based global-level model is used to consider a microelectronic 
component with an interfacial flaw under thermal or mechanical loading condition. A 3-D virtual crack closure 
technique is developed to extract the fracture mechanics parameters and the corresponding asymptotic stress and 
displacement fields around a curvilinear interface crack front. With the tractions and displacements near the crack tip 
extracted from the global model results, a local model based on cohesive laws of rupture at the interface is used to 
model the progressive propagation of the interfacial crack.  
In this study a custom micromechanical fracture testing apparatus is developed to characterize the interface 
resistance to fracture propagation. The fracture toughness for the polyimide-silicon interface is determined by using 
double cantilever beam fracture test. The methodology described in this report can be used to quantitatively 
predicting crack growth and serving as the framework for modeling reliability of advanced interconnects system.

μ is the shear modulus, νκ 43−=  for plane strain, ν is the Poisson’s ratio, and the subscripts = 1 and 2 refer to the 
materials above and below the crack plane, respectively. It may be seen from (1) that the complex stress intensity 
factor K has a unit of (stress)× (length) 1/2-iε. This oscillating nature makes characterizing the stress intensity factors 
difficult. To overcome this issue, Rice [5] suggested an alternative definition of stress intensity factors for the 
interface crack

The virtual crack closure technique is based on the hypothesis that crack growth is self-similar and the released 
strain energy during crack growth is the same as the amount of work required to close the crack. Therefore, the strain 
energy release rate G for a crack to extend by an infinitesimal distance Δ can be expressed as

For the case when large-scale contact occurs between crack faces around crack tip, the calculation for GI using 
(14) results in zero because the nodal values for crack opening are zero. For the case of a closed crack-tip, the finite 
element discretizations for GII and GIII are still applicable for obtaining II and III, respectively.

 under uniform cooling from 125°C to -40°C. 
 
Results of the finite element analysis indicate that the crack faces of the corner delamination are in full contact at 
-40°C. Consequently, KI is zero along the quarter-circular crack front. The stress intensity factors KII and KIII along 
the quarter-circular crack front are shown in Fig. 5. Note that the crack fronts along die edges are not considered, 
since the crack tips along die edges are surrounded by a 90° silicon wedge and a 270° underfill wedge, which leads 
to a stress singularity weaker than 1/2, and is beyond the scope of linear elastic fracture mechanics. It may be seen 
from Fig. 5 that the crack driving force is dominated by KII except near die edges. In addition, KII is highest around 
the middle of the crack front. 
For investigating the effect of crack shape on the delamination growth, finite element analyses are also 
performed for the case of a triangular corner delamination (Fig. 6) and for the case of a cusp-shaped corner 
delamination (Fig. 7). Again, in both cases the crack faces are in full contact at -40°C, and consequently, the mode-I 
stress intensity factor is zero. Distributions of KII and KIII along the crack front for the triangular and cusp-shaped 
corner cracks are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. It may be seen from Figs. 8 and 9 that KII is the dominant 
 10
the middle of the crack front. Comparing to the value of G for quarter circular crack, the values for both triangular 
and cusp-shaped cracks are higher around the middle of the crack front. Consequently, under thermomechanical 
loading both triangular and cusp-shaped corner cracks are likely to evolve into quarter circular crack before it 
propagates further more. Note that, for all three types of corner crack front, the sign of KII is negative. This implies 
that the interface crack is likely to propagate either along the die-underfill interface or kink into the bulk of the 
silicon die, depending on which has the weaker resistance to fracture. Since for typical underfill material the 
adhesion to die is much weaker than the toughness of the silicon die, the interface delamination is more likely to 
propagate along the interface.

2.1  Experimental Setup 
In this study double cantilever beam (DCB) fracture test is used to characterize the fracture resistance for the 
interface of interest. Sample configuration for the DCB test is shown in Fig. 11. For the DCB test, multilayer thin 
films with the interface of interest are first deposited on a silicon wafer of thickness 600μm. The wafer is then 
singulated into rectangular strips of 70mm×10mm. The Si strips with thin films layers on top are then adhered 
face-to-face using epoxy adhesive. Note that, before the Si strips are bonded, a thin gold layer that weakens the 
bonding between the epoxy and thin film is deposited partially on the surface of the thin film stack for serving as the 
pre-crack for the DCB specimen. Under external tensile load as depicted in Fig. 12, the crack would kink into and 
propagate along the interface with lowest resistance to fracture process. From the applied load and crack opening 
displacement, the strain energy release rate for the interface crack tip is given by

acquisition are performed by using LabVIEW software. In addition, a microscope with CCD camera is used to 
monitor the crack growth.

2.2  Interfacial Fracture Toughness  
The interfacial fracture toughness of a 10μm-thick polyimide coating on silicon substrate is measured by using 
the DCB test. The DCB test samples are first subjected to 10N fatigue preconditioning of more than 10000 cycles to 
ensure that the pre-crack induced by the sputtered Au is fully opened. The sample is then loaded monotonically by 
using a displacement rate of 1.66μm/sec until the interface crack starts to grow. When the crack length increases, the 
load required for maintaining the crack opening displacement reduces. Therefore, as soon as the load cell reading 
reduces, the LabVIEW test program unloads the DCB sample and then repeats the loading process until crack 
propagates again. Figure 15 shows a typical load vs. crack opening displacement curve for the DCB fracture test. It 
may be seen that in Fig. 15 the sample is completely fractured after 7 loading-unloading steps. From the load vs.

2) Cohesive zone model parameters for OSG-SiC and Silicon-Polyimide interfaces. 
The fracture toughness for a polyimide-silicon interface is measured by using DCB fracture test. However, 
OSG-SiC interface was not characterized due to the unavailability of the thin film. However, the methodology 
should still be applicable. 
In addition, the 3-D modeling approach developed in this project can be implemented in most of the commercial 
finite element software and is ready to transfer to Industrial users. Two international conference presentations [10-11] 
were given. A manuscript [12] describing the modeling methodology has been submitted for publication in technical 
journal.
