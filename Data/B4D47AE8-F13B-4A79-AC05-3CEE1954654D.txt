E is the root-mean-squared electric field strength (V/m). It is obviously SAR will be 
reduced with decreasing E. Therefore, the radiated power is increased with increasing 
E. In other words, the radiated power will dominate the performance (TRP/TIS) and 
conformance (SAR) of mobile phone. The radiated power comes from the power 
amplifier (PA) of mobile handset. The nature of PA is its output power will be pulled 
by different load, that is to say PA has load-pull nature. Most of mobile phone’s 
antenna input impedance can not match to the output impedance of PA, the impedance 
matching circuit (IMC) will act a impedance transformer. Antenna is the load of PA of 
mobile phone. We change the IMC appropriate for load-pull of PA, then to get the 
optimal output power. The nature of IMC will be shown in the Smith Chart. We try to 
divide Smith Chart into four region (I, II, III and IV), as shown in Fig. 1.

If the load-pull curve of PA in the Smith Chart is available, the first step is to find the 
Max. efficiency (ME) location in which region. The next step is to use IMC to match 
antenna’s input impedance approach to the ME of PA. Hence, when antenna’s input 
impedance change, the ME location in the Smith Chart will also change. So, based on 
this phenomenon, the out power of PA can be controlled. 
  
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we use a physical mobile phone to be the device under test (DUT). 
There are four cases will be studied. 
 
Case I: There is no IMC between antenna and PA. 
Fig. 2 shows measured VSWR and S21 of DUT.  Fig. 3 shows the impedance 
distribution of antenna combines IMC in the Smith Chart. The Table I shows the 
measures EIRP and SAR of DUT.
