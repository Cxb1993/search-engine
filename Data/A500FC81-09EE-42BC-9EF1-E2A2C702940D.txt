Abstract 
Two novel designs were proposed in this 
research. First, an ultra-wideband (UWB) 
waveform shaping network is presented. It feeds 
the output of a Gaussian pulse generator into a 
network composed of transmission line 
differentiators and lump circuit differentiators. 
The network shapes the iuput signals to output 
UWB pulses. The advantage of this design is 
that the output pulse can use as much bandwidth 
as possible and can concentrate the energy in 
the desired frequency band. It can fit different 
requirements by adjusting the parameters of the 
network. The second part is the microstrip line 
filter designs using defected ground structures 
(DGS). The advantage of using DGS is that the 
DGS is often equivalent to a shunt LC circuit, 
and thus is straightforward to implement filters 
whose lumped circuit model needs a shunt LC 
circuit model. Another good thing is that the 
values of the LC tank can be easily adjusted by 
changing the dimension of the DGS. By 
applying the DGS, we have designed a 
third-order elliptic function low pass filter and 
the measurement results show that the design is 
a good approximation to the lumped circuit 
the other is a band pass filter (BPF). The LPF is 
designed using elliptical function approach, and 
we show that the DGS is very suitable for LPF 
design using the elliptical function. The BPF 
shows a sharp frequency cutoff rate at the 
stop-band. No harmonics occur up to three 
times of the central frequency. 
 
Ultra-wide band pulse generator design 
(1) Apply the least square method to design the 
waveform shaping network:

approximation of ( )F ω is ( ) ( ) ( )Y W Hω ω ω=

to find a suitable ia to synthesize the pulse in 
frequency domain. 
 
(2) Design the differentiator circuits: 
We apply a finite difference to approximate the 
differentiation operation, and use transmission 
line (T.L.) sections and short stubs to fulfill the 
differentiator circuit. Besides, the lump RC 
differentiator is combined with the T.L. one to 
achieve better performance of higher order 
differentiators. The schematic diagram of a 2nd 
order differentiator is shown in Fig.1. 
(3) The numerical result of the pulse shaping 
network is shown in Fig.2. According to this 
result, the real circuit is designed and simulated 
using the Advanced Design System® of Agilent 
Technologies. Fig.3 is the layout of the whole 
network and Fig.4 shows the output pulse and 
its PSD. 
 
Microstrip line filter designs using DGS 
(1) Lumped Circuit Model of a DGS: 
First, we obtain the S21 curve with respect to the 
frequency of the desired DGS by measurement 
or simulation. Next, the curves are usually able 
to be matched with that by a shunt LC circuit 
[8]. Assume that the 3-dB cut-off frequency is fc 
and the resonant frequency is f0. Both 
frequencies can be read from the s parameter 
curves. Then the equivalent inductance and 
capacitance may be shown as 
[ ] pF5 220 ccp ff
f
C −= π  
( ) nH250 20fCL pp π=  
With the lumped circuit model, we can easily 
find out the effects of adjustment of the DGS 
geometric parameters simply using circuit 
simulation software. The simple shunt LC 
model above is often sufficient for frequencies 
less than the resonant frequency. If the circuit 
has to function correctly up to two or three 
times of the resonant frequency, the equivalent 
circuit model shown in Fig.5 has to be used.  
In such a model, θ1 and θ2 are used to model the 
50Ω microstrip line above the DGS, the shunt 
RgLgCg circuit is for simulating the behavior of 
a lossy shunt LC circuit, while the shunt RpCp 
circuit to the ground are to consider the loss of 
the DGS in high frequency [9].
