search process will become very slow. On the contrary, fuzzy c-mean algorithm can 
achieve faster convergence to optimal solution. This motivates us to combine these two 
algorithms to solve the spike sorting problem. In the first phase of this hybrid approach, 
the PSO algorithm uses cluster validity measures to evaluate the similarities among 
spikes. According to the evaluation of certain cluster validity, the spike data set is 
possible to divide into different clusters with different patterns of spikes. After the 
number of clusters, c, is determined in the process of PSO, the parameter c is then 
available for the second phase of using fuzzy c-mean. The solution of spike sorting is 
expected to search effectively and efficiently. 
The organization of this report as follows. The PSO algorithm, fuzzy c-mean, and 
clustering indexes are briefly introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the proposed 
hybrid method. Section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed method. Finally, 
Section 5 offers a summary. 
2. Background materials 
In the present section, we review some background materials to provide a 
foundation for later proposed algorithms. The focus of our interest is the basic concepts 
of PSO algorithms. In addition, the concepts of fuzzy c-mean and clustering validity 
indexes are described.  
2.1. Particle swarm optimization 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) [1, 2] provides a learning method modeled on 
the social behavior of flocks of birds. It is similar to a genetic algorithm (GA) and 
considered a population-based method that searches the solution space for an optimal 
solution. The swarm in PSO is analogous to a population in GA and consists of 
candidate solutions called particles. 
Each bird (particle) flies through the search space to locate an optimal location 
(solution) and modifies its velocity while searching. For a swarm of size n in a search 
space of dimension d, a particle modifies its velocity based on its historical velocity in 
the previous step, the best personal position it has so far achieved, and the best position 
it has so far discovered among its local neighbors. Let Vi = (vi1, vi2, …, vid) and Xi = (xi1, 
xi2, …, xid) be the velocity and position vectors of particle i, let Yi = (yi1, yi2, …, yid) be 
the personal position of particle i and let ( )idiii yyy ˆ,ˆ,ˆ 21 L) =Y be the best local position 
in the neighborhood of particle i. The formulas of the new velocity and position of 
particle i in the dimension j can be given in equations (1) and (2).

validity indexes to define the fitness function in PSO. Several clustering validity 
indexes [5-12] are used, such as Caliński and Harabasz (CH) index, SDbw, I, etc.. 
 
3. Our method 
In this section, we present the hybrid method for spike sorting. This study first 
presents data representations and fitness functions used in this proposed method. Next, 
we introduce a modified formula to update velocity for particles searching an optimal 
solution over different dimensions of vector spaces. Finally, we provide a complete 
algorithm. 
3.1. Data representations and fitness functions 
In this subsection, we present data representations and fitness functions used in the 
hybrid method. This study first introduces how a particle represents a candidate solution 
for data clustering, and then describes how a fitness function may be used in the 
proposed algorithm. 
 
Data representations: 
Assume that a data set D ∈ Rm is going to partition into c clusters, and assume the 
resulting centers are z1, z2, …, and zc. If we view each particle as a possible result of 
data clustering, then a position vector Xi that stores the set of cluster centers can be 
represented as a candidate solution. That is,  
                                              ),,,( 21 ciiii zzz L=X                                       (3) 
Note that we can consider Xi ∈ Rd, where d = m * c, since all cluster centers, (z1, z2, …, 
zc), are located in Rm. Another thing we need to point out is that all of the particles in the 
swarm do not hold the same number d, since the value of d depends on the number of 
clusters c. The study proposed algorithm examines a sequence of clustering structures 
from the possible minimum Cmin to the maximum Cmax. The value d therefore ranges 
from m * Cmin to m * Cmax. The variable component of solution vector Xi requires a 
modification to update the particle’s velocity, as described in the next subsection. 
 
Fitness functions: 
To use a PSO based approach as a data-clustering algorithm, we have to transform 
the data-clustering problem to an optimization problem, and the fitness function ought 
to measure the quality of a candidate solution. In the proposed method, we adopt the 
clustering validity indexes as fitness functions. For example, if we use CH index [12] to 
 6
Case 1: C1 < C2 
This study randomly creates (C2 - C1) class centers and appends them to the end of 
vector Xi. This gives Xi and iYˆ  the same number of cluster centers, and hence the same 
number of components. 
 
After adjusting the number of components of Xi and iYˆ , the sharing information 
between them becomes possible. This study proposed two ways to create Gi, what we 
called arithmetic mean and geometric mean, given in Eq. (7) and Eq. (8), respectively. 
)ˆ,( ijijij yxmeanG =                                                          (7)

The modified formula to update velocity is now ready and shown in Eq. (9).

3.3 The algorithm 
The proposed method is a hybrid scheme of differential evolution based PSO and 
fuzzy c-mean. In the first phase, we developed a modified PSO with a differential 
perturb vector. The advantage of using a differential vector was to perturb the particles, 
thus increasing the diversity of solutions. To identify an appropriate number of clusters 
and suitable locations of cluster centers, we used clustering validity indexes as fitness 
functions to evaluate how good a particle is. The modified velocity formula of Eq. (9) 
was used to search across various solution spaces for the optimal solution. The 
procedure was repeated until a desired candidate solution had been found. This 
satisfactory candidate solution provided data clustering with the proper number of 
clusters and associated cluster centers. However, to overcome the weakness of hard 
clustering in which each piece of data was a member of exactly one cluster, we used 
fuzzy c-mean to adjust the locations of the cluster centers in the second phase. Having 
explained the approach, we provided algorithms of the proposed method in Table 1.

5. Conclusion  
 
In this project, we propose a hybrid method of using a modified particle swarm 
optimization and fuzzy c-mean to automatically determine the number of clusters and 
divide the spike dataset into groups of spikes with different patterns. The performance 
of the proposed method is compared with a well-known spike sorting method of Super-
Paramagnetic Clustering (SPC). The numerical results have shown that the hybrid 
method presents favorable performance in the grouping of spike data.

Abstract: 
Many researchers have used proteomic mass spectrometry 
for cancer detection and with various types of data 
preprocessing and classification methods to overcome data 
complexities. This research focuses on discovering different 
cancers display their unique proteomic patterns or have similar 
patterns with others. To meet this goal, this study introduces a 
complete data preprocessing procedure and applies a Fuzzy 
ART clustering method to differentiate the patterns among 
multiple cancer diseases. This approach shows the potential of 
separating cancer patterns from healthy patterns, as well as 
among different types of cancers. 
Keywords: 
Proteomics; Recursive_SVM; Fuzzy ART; Pattern 
Recognition; Cancer Detection 
1. Introduction 
The advent of mass spectrometry (MS) technology has 
driven recent progress in proteomic data analysis. With the 
serum proteomic spectra generated from MS technology, it 
is now possible to examine spectra with the purpose of 
identifying differentially expressed proteins in samples of 
diseases and healthy individuals [1, 2]. This has motivated 
us to investigate machine-learning approaches to analyze 
mass spectrometry proteomic data. This research 
differentiates the patterns among eight different cancers: 
Colorectal Cancer (CC), Lung Cancer (LC), Pancreatic 
Cancer (PC), Bladder Cancer (BC), Renal Cancer (RC), 
Liver Cancer (LC), Head and Neck Cancer (SCCA), and 
Prostate Cancer (PC) plus normal control (CON). These 
datasets are generated using the MS technology of SELDI 
TOF (Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization 
Time-of-Flight). This article differentiates cancers that 
comprise their own unique patterns or share similar patterns 
with other cancers. Due to the nature of MS data, data 
preprocessing is necessary to eliminate background noise 
and high dimensionality [3, 4, 5]. Therefore, this study 
engaged in a series of data preprocessing procedures, then 
used the Fuzzy ART (Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory) [6, 
7] approach to identify similar patterns of cancer samples. 
2. Datasets 
The Pathology Lab at John Hopkins and the 
Department of Otolaryngology at the Medical College of 
Georgia collected the serum samples. Dr. Adam’s Lab, at the 
Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine, Medical 
College of Georgia, USA, generated The SELDI data. A two 
dimensional spectrum from SELDI presented the generated 
data for each assay. The X-axis is the value of mass per 
charge (m/z), and the Y-axis is the relative intensity of the 
ion measurement. The dataset contains 540 spectra 
generated from eight different cancers plus healthy control 
(20 patients per group and 3 replicate assays per patient). 
Each spectrum has 60,479 data points (dimensions) that 
range from 8.58 to 100,301.63 m/z approximately. 
3. Methods 
This section introduces the data preprocessing 
procedure which is to apply on the SELDI data, and 
describes the clustering approach of Fuzzy ART used to 
differentiate the patterns of cancer diseases. 
3.1. Data Preprocessing 
To reduce the dimensionality and remove noise from 
the data, this study introduced a data preprocessing 
procedure. The procedure consisted of five steps, including 1) 
baseline subtraction and normalization, 2) quality 
assessment, 3) peak detection, 4) peak alignment, and 5) 
feature selection. The following briefly describes each step. 
 
Step 1: Baseline subtraction and normalization 
Due to the characteristics and limitations of SELDI 
technology, the lower values of the m/z data point contain

input patterns are unit vectors (γ = 1). That is, 
I
II N ≡ , and 1≡NI               (6) 
However, this normalization method may lose the 
amplitude information of the input patterns. Alternatively, a 
normalization rule called complement coding [6] solves the 
proliferation problem and maintains the amplitude 
information. Let an input pattern ( ),,,,,1 Mi aaaI ""=

 The experiments applied complement coding on the input 
patterns whose entries were intensities of selected features 
[8], and used Fuzzy ART [6] to recognize patterns of 
multiple cancer diseases. 
4. Experimental Results 
The purpose of this study was to discover whether 
different cancers have their own unique patterns or have 
similar patterns to others. Therefore, the first experiment 
stage compared each cancer with the healthy normal control. 
Due to the nature of MS data, SELDI data have much noise 
and high dimensionality. Therefore, the experiment 
implemented a procedure described in section 3.1 to 
de-noise and select important features. Table 1 shows the 
data preprocessing results for each test of different cancers 
versus the healthy normal control. Each test set consisted of 
two groups with 20 individuals per group. This experiment 
selected one of the best quality spectra from triplicate assays 
for each individual [3]. Therefore, each test comprised 40 
representative spectra for the following peak detection, 
alignment and feature selection. The column of Common 
Peaks indicated the number of common peaks produced by 
peak alignment and the column of Selected Features showed 
the number of selected features produced by 
Recursive-SVM [8] method. The common peaks ranged 
between 137 and 159; and the selected features ranged 
between 6 and 64 for all these comparisons. Interestingly, 
the selected features for the comparison between PAC and 
CON showed a much higher number, indicating this PAC 
group might present more heterogeneity in protein patterns.

Given the selected features, this study applied Fuzzy 
ART [6] to identify the patterns of different types of cancers. 
For example, Table 2 shows the results of the Fuzzy ART 
analysis of PCA versus CON using nine  selected features. 
This data analysis selected the vigilance parameter ρ to give 
the best clustering outcome. Each individual was given a 
cluster number. This cluster number indicated to which 
cluster this individual should belong. Note that the 
parameter ρ specifies the minimum fraction of the input that 
must remain in the matched pattern in order for resonance to 
occur. The larger the value of ρ, the more clusters are likely 
to be generated.

CON 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
 
From Table 2, all twenty PCA patients were grouped 
into the same cluster when ρ = 0.42, but the healthy normal 
control individuals were distributed into two different 
clusters. As described previously, when the ρ value increased, 
the cluster number also increased. To evaluate the results, 
Table 3 presents the calculated sensitivity and specificity. 
Therefore, tuning the vigilance ρ values changed the 
sensitivity and the specificity of the test. The test obtained a 
best sensitivity and specificity of 80.0% and 90.0%, 
respectively, when vigilance ρ was 0.44 in the analysis of 
comparison between PCA and CON.

5. Conclusions 
This study investigated whether each cancer has a 
unique pattern based on MS data. To accomplish this goal, 
we proposed and implemented an entire procedure of data 
preprocessing and then applied Fuzzy ART to distinguish the 
patterns of different types of cancer. Our work revealed that 
the pattern of each cancer was obviously different from 
healthy normal controls. Although each cancer disease 
seemed to have several different patterns, which confirmed 
the heterogeneous nature of cancer. The separation for each 
type of cancer was more involved than the proposed 
approach can manage. Further refinement of this data 
analysis strategy, in the direction of feature selection, is 
necessary.
