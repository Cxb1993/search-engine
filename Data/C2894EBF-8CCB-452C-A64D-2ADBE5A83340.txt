Abstract 
Instead of using wheat starch as the pore foaming agent, silica particles that have 
resulted from sulfuric acidification of water glass solution serve as the pore-forming 
agent for preparing PVF/SiO2 porous foam in the present study. We find that the pore 
structure of PVF/SiO2 foam is very different from that of PVF/starch foam. The effect 
of the concentration of these pore-forming agents on the pore structure, mechanical 
modulus and water content of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams are investigated in the 
present study.

1. Introduction: 
 Poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA) is a well studied hydrophilic polymer with a good 
reputation in the superabsorbent polymer (SAP) industry [1]. PVA is a nontoxic and 
biodegradable polymer [2] that can be applied to synthesis porous Poly(vinyl formal) 
(PVF) foam used in cleaning and washing processes in electronic compartment 
manufacturing plants. A few examples of the applications they are used for are the 
different types of sponge rollers used in the cleaning processes of hard disks, silicon 
wafers, photomask and glass panel for LCD [3]. Using sulfuric acid as catalyst and 
5 
 
effects of the alkyl silicate concentration, pH value, reaction time and temperature. 
[13, 14]. By using silica powders as the pore-forming agent, Sueoka et al. [7] 
incorporated these powders into PVA solution to make a microporous PVF membrane. 
They found that a PVF membrane with an average pore size of 0.01 to 50 microns can 
be produced, when those silica powders with uniform particle sizes within the range 
of 0.005-10 microns were employed. Their PVF membranes possessed a porosity of at 
least 60%. Since the porous PVF foam is prepared by the acetalization reaction 
through the mixing of PVA and formaldehyde under acidic condition, and fine silica 
particles can be synthesized simultaneously when sulfuric acid is added to the water 
glass solution, both procedures would benefit from the use of the water glass solution 
produced silica particles as the pore-forming agent when PVF foam is made in the 
present paper.  
 A new method of preparing PVF porous foam through the simultaneous 
acidification of water glass solution to produce SiO2 particles and PVF formation will 
be presented in this study. Properties of PVF foam made from wheat starch and from 
silica particle produced by water glass solution as the pore-forming agent will be 
compared. Additionally, the effect of their concentrations on the pore structure of the 
PVF foam will be investigated. Moreover, the water contents of the PVF foams 
obtained by using these two pore-forming agents will be studied in detail through the 
analyses of pore size distribution, mechanical modulus and thermal property. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Materials 
 Commercial PVA (BF-05; 99.3 wt%) with averaged polymerization degree of 
500 and hydrolysis degree of 98.5-99.2 mol% were obtained from Chang-Chun 
Petrochemical Co., Ltd, Taiwan. The starch used in this study was unmodified native 
wheat starch purchased from Sigma-Aldrich USA (S5127, CAS No. 9005-25-8). The 
7 
 
formaldehyde solution (24 wt%) and 30 ml of 50 wt% sulfuric acid. Other reaction 
solutions of containing 12 wt% PVA and 0.05-0.25 wt% water glass solution were 
prepared by the same procedure with suitable amount of water glass solution added. 
 Each of the above reaction solution was finally introduced to a hard plastic 
rectangular vessel with a dimension of 15 cm x 20 cm and 5 cm in height. The vessels 
were then put in a temperature-controlled oven to carry out the acetalization reaction 
at 60°C for eight hours. The resulting samples of porous PVF foam were washed 
thoroughly with water to remove the remaining sulfuric acid, formaldehyde and 
pore-forming agent of either the wheat starch or the silica particle.  
2.3. Scanning electron microscope imaging 
 To observe the pore size distribution of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams, the 
samples were coated with a thin layer of gold (coating at 5.0 Pa and 20 mA for 80 
seconds) and then monitored by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7000F, 
JEOL, Japan) at a 15 KV accelerating voltage.  
2.4. DSC and TGA thermal analyses 
 A Perkin-Elmer DSC Pyris-1 instrument was used to determine the glass 
transition temperature ( gT ) of 5 mg of the PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foam samples. 
The temperatures were scanned from 0°C to 150°C with a heating rate of 20°C/min 
under nitrogen flow rate of 20 cm3/min. The water content and the water desorption 
rate of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams were determined using DuPont TGA-Q50 
thermal analyzer [16]. Under nitrogen flow rate of 100 cm3/min, the water contents of 
PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams were calculated from the weight loss at 100°C when 
each 20 mg sample was heated from room temperature to 600°C with a heating rate of 
10°C/min, and the water desorption rate was determined when each sample was 
heated at 50°C for 50 minutes, respectively.  
9 
 
acetalization period, the increased viscosity as shown in Fig. 2 causes higher porosity 
but smaller pore size when the concentration of wheat starch is increased.  
 Figs. 3(a)-(e) show the SEM pictures of the pore structure of PVF/SiO2 foams 
obtained when different concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 wt% water 
glass solution served as the pore-forming agent, under the same concentration of 12 
wt% PVA as the acetalization reaction proceeded at 60°C for eight hours. It was found 
that the pore structures of PVF/SiO2 foams shown in Figs. 3(a)-(e) belong to a 
closed-cell type but with many small pores existing on the pore walls. The average 
diameter of those closed-cell type pores are as big as 400 m , and the porosity and 
pore size of PVF/SiO2 foams only increase slightly when silica particle concentration 
is increased from 0.05 wt% to 0.25 wt%. As acetalization proceeds, since the affinity 
between PVF and H2O molecules of aqueous solution decreases, so many H2O 
molecules become unbounded from the PVF. Because the hydrophilic surfaces of 
silica particles can preferentially adsorb those unbounded H2O molecules and those 
water molecules condensed from the acetalization reaction, and those adsorbed water 
molecules will accelerate the aggregation rate of silica particles consequently, the 
aggregates of silica particle gradually become bigger as reaction proceeds, which will 
finally cause a closed-cell type pore structure as observed in Figs. 3(a)-(e). In addition, 
it was found that there are many small pores left on the pore walls when the PVF/SiO2 
foams were washed thoroughly with water in the final step. Fig. 4 shows an example 
of the SEM picture of sodium silicate particle size distribution obtained at pH 7.0 
when 0.15 wt% of silica particles were added to 12 wt% PVA aqueous solution. 
Because the particle sizes of those silica particles are smaller than 1.0 m , we believe 
that the small pores existing on the pore walls as observed in Figs. 3(a)-(e) were made 
by those un-aggregated silica particles associated with their surface water molecules. 
The porosity of both PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams were analyzed by the 
11 
 
silica particle do not affect the hybrid bond formation between PVA and formaldehyde 
molecules as acetalization proceeds.  
3.3. Young’s modulus of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams 
 The Young’s modulus of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams can be determined 
from the slope of the strain-stress curves of foam samples chosen by the average value 
of six tensile tests; i.e. Fig. 9 shows an example of the strain-stress curves of 
PVF/starch foam made of 12 wt% PVA when 1.0 wt% wheat starch was served as the 
pore-forming agent. Fig. 10(a) shows the Young's modulus of PVF/starch foams when 
1.0-5.0 wt% of wheat starch served as the pore-forming agent--the higher the 
concentration of wheat starch, the lower the Young’s modulus of PVF/starch foams. 
Because a foam of higher porosity but smaller pore size can be obtained when the 
concentration of wheat starch is increased from 1.0 to 5.0 wt%., which will lower the 
mass content per unit volume of PVF foam and consequently make thinner pore walls 
as shown in Figs. 1(a)-(e), the foam’s modulus decreases with the increase of wheat 
starch concentration. But, the porosity and pore size of for PVF/SiO2 foams change 
only slightly as observed in Fig. 3(a)-(e), hence their modulus values vary only 
between 0.13 Mpa and 0.14 Mpa as shown in Fig. 10(b) when 0.05-0.25 wt% of silica 
particles served as the pore-forming agent. 
3.4. Water content and water desorption rate of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams 
 The water contents of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams can be determined from 
the TGA curves of sample weight loss at 100°C. As shown in Fig. 11, there is an 84% 
weight loss of water at 100°C from PVF/starch foam which is made of 12 wt% PVA 
with 1.0 wt% wheat starch. The same value of 84% water weight loss at 100°C was 
obtained for other PVF/starch samples with 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 wt% wheat starch. 
This value of 84% water weight loss was also obtained for those PVF/SiO2 foams 
when different amounts of 0.05-0.25 wt% silica particle were served as the 
13 
 
solution is presented in this study. After conducting our analysis with the help of SEM, 
DSC, TGA and Stress-Strain data, we have arrived at seven conclusions: (1) The pore 
structure of PVF/starch foams belongs to an open-cell type and of PVF/SiO2 foams 
belongs to a closed-cell type. (2) Higher porosity but smaller pore size PVF/starch 
foams can be obtained when the concentration of wheat starch is increased, and the 
porosity and pore size of PVF/SiO2 foams increase only slightly when the 
concentration of water glass solution is increased. (3) The porosity of PVF/SiO2 
foams is always higher than that of PVF/starch foam obtained. (4) The present 
PVF/SiO2 foams possess larger pore size and higher porosity than those of the PVF 
membranes reported by Sueoka et al. [7] where the silica powders were served as the 
pore–forming agent. The unchanged gT  indicates that the pore-foaming agent of 
either wheat starch or silica particle will not affect the hybrid bonds formatted through 
the acetalization reaction. (5) The Young’s modulus of PVF/starch foams decreases 
with the increase of wheat starch concentration, and the Young’s modulus of 
PVF/SiO2 foams won't be affected by the concentration of silica particles produced by 
the water glass solution. (6) Because the PVA concentration was fixed at 12 wt% 
when preparing foam samples, the water contents of the PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 
foams obtained in the present study are not affected by the concentrations of either 
wheat starch or silica particle when they are served as the pore-forming agent. (7) The 
water desorption rates of PVF/starch foams increase with the increase of wheat starch 
concentration, however, the water desorption rates of PVF/SiO2 foams remain largely 
unchanged when different concentrations of silica particles produced by the 
acidification of water glass solution served as the pore-forming agent in the present 
study.

A New Correlation Equation for Predicting Filter Coefficient Ratio under Unfavorable 
Deposition Conditions – A Comparison 
You-Im Chang*, Wei-You Cheng and Keng-Yi Liao 
Department of Chemical Engineering, Tunghai University, 40704 Taichung, Taiwan 
ABSTRACT 
Based on the simulation results obtained by using the Brownian dynamics 
simulation method and those available filtration experimental data, the accuracy of 
three correlation equations on predicting filter coefficient ratio under unfavorable 
deposition conditions with a larger repulsive energy barrier of DLVO theory is 
investigated in the present paper. It is found that the present algebraic averaged 
correlation equation still can give a better prediction on the filter coefficient ratio than 
the previous ones.

INTRODUCTION 
In deep bed filtration used in water and wastewater treatment, a thorough 
understanding of the transport and deposition behavior of colloidal particles in porous 
media is essential to the design and operation of filtration systems. The surface 
interaction forces between filter grains and colloidal particles to be removed include 
the electric double layer repulsive force and the van der Waals attractive force, and 
their combination forms the basis of DLVO theory (Verwey & Overbeek, 1948). In 
the case when the combined force is repulsive, colloidal deposition becomes 
unfavorable. Therefore, accurate prediction of the effect of unfavorable interactions is 
important to establish the guidelines making colloidal suspensions more amenable to 
the filtration process. 
 4
and p  and g  are the surface electric potentials of the particle and the granular 
collector, respectively.  
In our previous paper (Chang & Chan, 2008), a correlation equation for 
predicting the filter coefficient under unfavorable deposition conditions was also 
established. When using the triangular network model by adopting the trajectory 
analysis method (Tien & Ramarao, 2007), as the sum of four individual deposition 
mechanisms, e.g. the Brownian diffusion, the DLVO interactions, the gravitational 
force and the interception, our correlation equation (see Equation (3) below) was 
successfully obtained by regressing against a broad range of parameter values 
governing particle deposition in deep bed filtration.

is the electric double layer number, 1EN  and 2EN  are the first and the second 
electrokinetic numbers of the DLVO theory. The definitions of these dimensionless 
numbers are provided in Table 1.  
When comparing with the available experimental data, we found that our 
correlation equation can fit well with the experimental data especially for sub-micro 
particles whose strong Brownian motion behavior can’t be ignored. On the other hand, 
our correlation equation is less precise than the Bai and Tien’s equation for large size 
particles. So, in order to provide a better agreement between the experimental data 
and the equation’s prediction for both large and small size particles, we further take

In the present study, the flow field equations established by Chow & Soda (1972) 
and modified by Chiang & Tien (1985) will be adopted.  
BROWNIAN DYNAMICS SIMULATION 
Similar to the previous papers by Ramarao et al. (1994) and Chang et al. (1998), 
with the consideration of the Brownian diffusion force in determining particle 
trajectories, the method of Brownian dynamics simulation is adopted in the present 
study. In this simulation method, the new position of the ith particle in SCT can be 
obtained by the integration of a Langevin type equation with a sufficient short time 
interval as follows,

the external DLVO forces which is the sum of the van der Waals force LoF and the 
electric repulsive force  DLF , and )(tA  represents the Brownian diffusion forces per 
unit mass of the particle caused by random collisions of the fluid molecules. From the 
trajectory of a given particle, one can then determine whether this particle will deposit 
on the granular collector or not. With these simulation steps, the single collector 
collection efficiency describing the initial deposition rate of Brownian particles can be 
defined as:

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In the present study, with 0.1 m pia  1.0 m , 20gd m  and 
0.05 3.0sec sec
cm cmU  , the effects of the four types of DLVO interaction 
energy curves on the initial collection efficiency s  of Brownian particles will be 
investigated theoretically. As shown in Figure 2, curves A exhibits a large primary 
maximum and a deep secondary minimum; curve B displays a large primary 
maximum and a negligible secondary minimum; while curve C shows a deep 
secondary minimum only and the "barrierless" interaction energy curve is represented 
by curve D. In this figure, 1EN =105.0 and DLN =10.75 for curve A, 1EN =50.0 and 
DLN =5.02 for curve B, 1EN =77.0 and DLN =10.0 for curve C, 1EN =0.0 and 
DLN =0.0 for curve D, and 2EN =1.0 and LoN =7.0 for all four curves. In our previous 
paper Chang et al. (1998), we found that the initial collection efficiency of curve D 
(i.e. 0s ) is always greater than that of other three curves when Reynolds number of 
fluid is small because there is no energy barrier exists (i.e. the favorable deposition 
condition), and the deposition mechanism of particles is controlled by the Brownian 
diffusion effect. For curves A, B and C (i.e. the unfavorable deposition conditions), it 
was found that, even with the presence of the deep secondary minimum which 
increases the accumulation probability of particles for curves B and C, the steepest 
 10
of the particle inertia when ReN >0.5. This explains why there is a maximum in this 
"barrierless" curve D as shown in Figure 3. 
Contrary to the decreasing tendency observed in curve D, the values of s  of 
curves A, B and C increase with the increase of ReN  as shown in Figure 3, because 
the increased inertia forces can overcome the energy barriers shown in Figure 2.  
Comparing curve A with curves B and C, it is found that, even with the presence of 
the deep secondary minimum which increases the accumulation of particles for curves 
B and C, the steep slope between the secondary minimum and the primary maximum 
energy barriers of curve A is still the main reason for its lowest collection efficiency 
among the three curves. But, when ReN  0.7, because of a greater sweep away 
probability caused by the tangential fluid convection force acting on those particles 
accumulating at the secondary minimum, the s  of curve C is smaller than that of 
curve B. 
To demonstrate the effect of increasing the height of the primary maximum energy 
barrier of DLVO theory on s , a case study was undertaken by doubling the value of 
1EN  adopted in Figure 2 (i.e. by increasing 1EN =105.0 to 1EN =210.0), while 
keeping the values of 2EN , LoN  and DLN  unchanged. The corresponded four 
interaction energy curves of DLVO theory and the obtained simulation values of s  
versus ReN  are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. Because the electric 
repulsive force increases with the increase of 1EN , hence those s  values of curves 
 12
experimental values of 0.5   as shown in Figure 7). On the other hand, Equation 
(4) can fit well with those experimental data especially for sub-micro particles whose 
strong Brownian motion behavior can’t be ignored (i.e. when experimental values of 
0.01   as shown in Figure 7). When comparing with the variance values, Equation 
(4) still can give the best prediction among Equations (2)-(4). 
CONCLUSIONS 
 The accuracy of Equations (2)-(4) on predicting the filter coefficient ratio under 
unfavorable deposition conditions are compared theoretically and experimentally by 
using the Brownian dynamics simulation method in a constricted tube model. Two 
important conclusions can be drawn: (1) Equation (4) gives best prediction on the 
filter coefficient ratio obtained by the present simulation method. (2) Even can’t 
predict well for the large particle size, Equation (4) still can give the best prediction 
on the filter coefficient ratio for those available experimental data in general.

applications, such as the displacement process occurred in the tertiary oil recovery 
process [12] and the modeling of fluid transport in disordered fibrous materials [13]. 
Since the averaged coordination number of the Voronoi network is the same as that of 
the triangular regular network (Z=6), by means of the Monte Carlo simulation method, 
Jerauld et al. [14] had verified that the effective conductivity of these two models are 
similar with each other. When the transient phenomena of diffusion and conduction in 
heterogeneous media represented by the Voronoi network were studied, Sahimi and 
Tsotsis [2] had also verified that the EMA predictions [4] are in agreement with the 
Monte Carol results. Since there is still no analysis was given on the comparisons of 
the particle effluent concentration and the permeability reduction between the Voronoi 
network and the regular triangular network, in order to amend this deficiency, a case 
study by using the Brownian dynamic simulation method of solving Langevin type 
equations will be carried out in the present paper. The effect of particle’s Brownian 
motion behavior on its breakthrough concentration and the permeability reduction of 
these two network models will also be investigated. 
II. THEORETICAL FORMULAS 
A. Network Model 
In the present study, we use the 2-D Voronoi and regular triangular networks of 
the same area in size (as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)) to represent the porous media, 
and adopt the Brownian dynamic simulation method to track the individual particles 
as they move through the network. The Voronoi network is mapped by using the 
software of MATHLAB with (x= rand (1, 10); y= rand (1, 10); plot (x, y, ‘diamond’)) 
[15]. The averaged coordination number of the present Voronoi network is found to be 
Z=5.8, which is close to the value of regular triangular network Z=6. In Figs. 1(a) and 
1(b), all bonds in the network are assumed to have the Raleigh form pore size 
distribution [4]. 
As particles of a given size distribution transport through a bond shown in Figs. 
1(a) and 1(b), they will arrive at a node where the fluid will be separated by two or 
more paths to flow further into the network. In the present study, we adopt the method 
of flow biased probability to determine either one path for particles to flow through. 
This biased method is based on the principle that the movement of the particle toward 
a path with a greater flow rate. Details of this method can be found elsewhere [5].

B. Constricted Tube Cell 
The parabolic geometric structure (PCT as parabolic constricted tube) used by 
Tien et al. [3] is considered for the constricted tube model in the present study. The 
flow field equations established by Chow and Soda [16] and modified by Chiang and 
Tien [17] are adopted.

secondary minimum which increases the accumulation probability of particles, the 
steepest slope between the secondary minimum and the primary maximum energy 
barriers of curve A is still the main reason for its low collection efficiency. In our 
previous papers [8, 9], we found that the existence of those two characteristic energy 
barriers is important in determining the reduction of permeability ratio K/K0. 
III. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Simulations are performed on those two-dimensional networks shown in Fig. 1 
with the same initial permeability K0 = 0.39μm2 and the influent velocity is kept at 0.1 
cm/sec. The number of bonds for the triangular network is NL =10×18 and for the 
Voronoi network is NL = 180. The parameter values adopted in the simulation are: εi0 = 
0.4, df = 20.0μm for the triangular network, df = 27.0μm for the Voronoi network, rpm 
= 0.5μm and Cin = 1000 particles per cm3. Similar simulation procedure of tracking 
individual Brownian particles to move through the network described in our previous 
paper is adopted [8, 9]. 
Corresponding to curve A in Fig. 3, the simulation results of the breakthrough 
curves of particles under the unfavorable deposition condition as the function of pore 
volumes injected are given in Fig. 4(a). In this figure, both the particle size and the 
pore size are of the Raleigh type distribution, and the effect of considering the 
Brownian diffusion force is investigated. It can be found that the breakthrough 
Cout/Cin values of these two network models are all the same with each other for both 
Brownian and non-Brownian particles; i.e. Cout/Cin = 0.92 for Brownian particles and 
Cout/Cin = 0.8 for non-Brownian particles when the breakthrough moments are 
achieved. However, because the triangular network owns the same Z value (Z=6) at 
each node and the Z value at each node of the Voronoi network various randomly 
from Z=4 to Z=8 as shown in Fig. 1, hence those particles can transport easier and 
deposit at the interior region of the triangular network and therefore its initial 
increasing rate of Cout/Cin is lower than that of the Voronoi network, hence the 
breakthrough moment of the Voronoi network is earlier than that of the triangular 
network. The corresponded reduction of permeability ratio K/K0 is shown in Fig. 4(b), 
since those particles are more difficult to move through the random distributed bonds 
of the Voronoi network, so the decreasing rate of K/K0 is higher than that of the 
triangular network for both Brownian and non-Brownian particles. When the effect of 
particle’s Brownian motion behavior is compared in the same network for the 
breakthrough curves of Cout/Cin, because under the unfavorable deposition condition 
the Brownian particles can transport further inside the network and the probability of 
particles staining small pores is increased, hence their effluent concentrations are 
higher than those of particles without Brownian diffusion behavior as observed in Fig. 
4(a), which will also cause a higher permeability reduction than that of non-Brownian 
as shown in Fig. 4(b) consequently.

particles can transport further inside the network and the probability of particles 
staining small pores is increased, hence their Cout/Cin values are higher and the 
corresponded K/K0 values are lower than those of non-Brownian particles. An 
opposite result is obtained under the favorable deposition condition. Same results are 
obtained for the Voronoi network. (3) Under the unfavorable deposition condition, 
because those Brownian/non-Brownian particles are more difficult to deposit in the 
random distributed bonds of the Voronoi network, so its breakthrough moment is 
earlier and the corresponded K/K0 values are lower than that of the triangular network. 
(4) On the contrary, when under the favorable deposition condition, since those 
Brownian/non-Brownian particles are easier to transport inside the bonds and to 
deposit at the interior region of the triangular network, so its Cout/Cin values are 
smaller and the corresponded K/K0 values are larger than those values of the Voronoi 
network. (5) For Brownian particles in the either triangular or Voronoi network under 
the favorable deposition condition, since more particles can deposit at the interior 
region of these two networks, their  Cout/Cin values are smaller and the corresponded 
K/K0 values are larger than those values obtained under the unfavorable deposition 
condition. Similar results are obtained for the non-Brownian particles.

Abstract 
Instead of using wheat starch as the pore foaming agent, silica particles that have 
resulted from sulfuric acidification of water glass solution serve as the pore-forming 
agent for preparing PVF/SiO2 porous foam in the present study. We find that the pore 
structure of PVF/SiO2 foam is very different from that of PVF/starch foam. The effect 
of the concentration of these pore-forming agents on the pore structure, mechanical 
modulus and water content of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams are investigated in the 
present study.

1. Introduction: 
 Poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA) is a well studied hydrophilic polymer with a good 
reputation in the superabsorbent polymer (SAP) industry [1]. PVA is a nontoxic and 
biodegradable polymer [2] that can be applied to synthesis porous Poly(vinyl formal) 
(PVF) foam used in cleaning and washing processes in electronic compartment 
manufacturing plants. A few examples of the applications they are used for are the 
different types of sponge rollers used in the cleaning processes of hard disks, silicon 
wafers, photomask and glass panel for LCD [3]. Using sulfuric acid as catalyst and 
5 
 
effects of the alkyl silicate concentration, pH value, reaction time and temperature. 
[13, 14]. By using silica powders as the pore-forming agent, Sueoka et al. [7] 
incorporated these powders into PVA solution to make a microporous PVF membrane. 
They found that a PVF membrane with an average pore size of 0.01 to 50 microns can 
be produced, when those silica powders with uniform particle sizes within the range 
of 0.005-10 microns were employed. Their PVF membranes possessed a porosity of at 
least 60%. Since the porous PVF foam is prepared by the acetalization reaction 
through the mixing of PVA and formaldehyde under acidic condition, and fine silica 
particles can be synthesized simultaneously when sulfuric acid is added to the water 
glass solution, both procedures would benefit from the use of the water glass solution 
produced silica particles as the pore-forming agent when PVF foam is made in the 
present paper.  
 A new method of preparing PVF porous foam through the simultaneous 
acidification of water glass solution to produce SiO2 particles and PVF formation will 
be presented in this study. Properties of PVF foam made from wheat starch and from 
silica particle produced by water glass solution as the pore-forming agent will be 
compared. Additionally, the effect of their concentrations on the pore structure of the 
PVF foam will be investigated. Moreover, the water contents of the PVF foams 
obtained by using these two pore-forming agents will be studied in detail through the 
analyses of pore size distribution, mechanical modulus and thermal property. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Materials 
 Commercial PVA (BF-05; 99.3 wt%) with averaged polymerization degree of 
500 and hydrolysis degree of 98.5-99.2 mol% were obtained from Chang-Chun 
Petrochemical Co., Ltd, Taiwan. The starch used in this study was unmodified native 
wheat starch purchased from Sigma-Aldrich USA (S5127, CAS No. 9005-25-8). The 
7 
 
formaldehyde solution (24 wt%) and 30 ml of 50 wt% sulfuric acid. Other reaction 
solutions of containing 12 wt% PVA and 0.05-0.25 wt% water glass solution were 
prepared by the same procedure with suitable amount of water glass solution added. 
 Each of the above reaction solution was finally introduced to a hard plastic 
rectangular vessel with a dimension of 15 cm x 20 cm and 5 cm in height. The vessels 
were then put in a temperature-controlled oven to carry out the acetalization reaction 
at 60°C for eight hours. The resulting samples of porous PVF foam were washed 
thoroughly with water to remove the remaining sulfuric acid, formaldehyde and 
pore-forming agent of either the wheat starch or the silica particle.  
2.3. Scanning electron microscope imaging 
 To observe the pore size distribution of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams, the 
samples were coated with a thin layer of gold (coating at 5.0 Pa and 20 mA for 80 
seconds) and then monitored by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7000F, 
JEOL, Japan) at a 15 KV accelerating voltage.  
2.4. DSC and TGA thermal analyses 
 A Perkin-Elmer DSC Pyris-1 instrument was used to determine the glass 
transition temperature ( gT ) of 5 mg of the PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foam samples. 
The temperatures were scanned from 0°C to 150°C with a heating rate of 20°C/min 
under nitrogen flow rate of 20 cm3/min. The water content and the water desorption 
rate of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams were determined using DuPont TGA-Q50 
thermal analyzer [16]. Under nitrogen flow rate of 100 cm3/min, the water contents of 
PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams were calculated from the weight loss at 100°C when 
each 20 mg sample was heated from room temperature to 600°C with a heating rate of 
10°C/min, and the water desorption rate was determined when each sample was 
heated at 50°C for 50 minutes, respectively.  
9 
 
acetalization period, the increased viscosity as shown in Fig. 2 causes higher porosity 
but smaller pore size when the concentration of wheat starch is increased.  
 Figs. 3(a)-(e) show the SEM pictures of the pore structure of PVF/SiO2 foams 
obtained when different concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 wt% water 
glass solution served as the pore-forming agent, under the same concentration of 12 
wt% PVA as the acetalization reaction proceeded at 60°C for eight hours. It was found 
that the pore structures of PVF/SiO2 foams shown in Figs. 3(a)-(e) belong to a 
closed-cell type but with many small pores existing on the pore walls. The average 
diameter of those closed-cell type pores are as big as 400 m , and the porosity and 
pore size of PVF/SiO2 foams only increase slightly when silica particle concentration 
is increased from 0.05 wt% to 0.25 wt%. As acetalization proceeds, since the affinity 
between PVF and H2O molecules of aqueous solution decreases, so many H2O 
molecules become unbounded from the PVF. Because the hydrophilic surfaces of 
silica particles can preferentially adsorb those unbounded H2O molecules and those 
water molecules condensed from the acetalization reaction, and those adsorbed water 
molecules will accelerate the aggregation rate of silica particles consequently, the 
aggregates of silica particle gradually become bigger as reaction proceeds, which will 
finally cause a closed-cell type pore structure as observed in Figs. 3(a)-(e). In addition, 
it was found that there are many small pores left on the pore walls when the PVF/SiO2 
foams were washed thoroughly with water in the final step. Fig. 4 shows an example 
of the SEM picture of sodium silicate particle size distribution obtained at pH 7.0 
when 0.15 wt% of silica particles were added to 12 wt% PVA aqueous solution. 
Because the particle sizes of those silica particles are smaller than 1.0 m , we believe 
that the small pores existing on the pore walls as observed in Figs. 3(a)-(e) were made 
by those un-aggregated silica particles associated with their surface water molecules. 
The porosity of both PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams were analyzed by the 
11 
 
silica particle do not affect the hybrid bond formation between PVA and formaldehyde 
molecules as acetalization proceeds.  
3.3. Young’s modulus of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams 
 The Young’s modulus of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams can be determined 
from the slope of the strain-stress curves of foam samples chosen by the average value 
of six tensile tests; i.e. Fig. 9 shows an example of the strain-stress curves of 
PVF/starch foam made of 12 wt% PVA when 1.0 wt% wheat starch was served as the 
pore-forming agent. Fig. 10(a) shows the Young's modulus of PVF/starch foams when 
1.0-5.0 wt% of wheat starch served as the pore-forming agent--the higher the 
concentration of wheat starch, the lower the Young’s modulus of PVF/starch foams. 
Because a foam of higher porosity but smaller pore size can be obtained when the 
concentration of wheat starch is increased from 1.0 to 5.0 wt%., which will lower the 
mass content per unit volume of PVF foam and consequently make thinner pore walls 
as shown in Figs. 1(a)-(e), the foam’s modulus decreases with the increase of wheat 
starch concentration. But, the porosity and pore size of for PVF/SiO2 foams change 
only slightly as observed in Fig. 3(a)-(e), hence their modulus values vary only 
between 0.13 Mpa and 0.14 Mpa as shown in Fig. 10(b) when 0.05-0.25 wt% of silica 
particles served as the pore-forming agent. 
3.4. Water content and water desorption rate of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams 
 The water contents of PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 foams can be determined from 
the TGA curves of sample weight loss at 100°C. As shown in Fig. 11, there is an 84% 
weight loss of water at 100°C from PVF/starch foam which is made of 12 wt% PVA 
with 1.0 wt% wheat starch. The same value of 84% water weight loss at 100°C was 
obtained for other PVF/starch samples with 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 wt% wheat starch. 
This value of 84% water weight loss was also obtained for those PVF/SiO2 foams 
when different amounts of 0.05-0.25 wt% silica particle were served as the 
13 
 
solution is presented in this study. After conducting our analysis with the help of SEM, 
DSC, TGA and Stress-Strain data, we have arrived at seven conclusions: (1) The pore 
structure of PVF/starch foams belongs to an open-cell type and of PVF/SiO2 foams 
belongs to a closed-cell type. (2) Higher porosity but smaller pore size PVF/starch 
foams can be obtained when the concentration of wheat starch is increased, and the 
porosity and pore size of PVF/SiO2 foams increase only slightly when the 
concentration of water glass solution is increased. (3) The porosity of PVF/SiO2 
foams is always higher than that of PVF/starch foam obtained. (4) The present 
PVF/SiO2 foams possess larger pore size and higher porosity than those of the PVF 
membranes reported by Sueoka et al. [7] where the silica powders were served as the 
pore–forming agent. The unchanged gT  indicates that the pore-foaming agent of 
either wheat starch or silica particle will not affect the hybrid bonds formatted through 
the acetalization reaction. (5) The Young’s modulus of PVF/starch foams decreases 
with the increase of wheat starch concentration, and the Young’s modulus of 
PVF/SiO2 foams won't be affected by the concentration of silica particles produced by 
the water glass solution. (6) Because the PVA concentration was fixed at 12 wt% 
when preparing foam samples, the water contents of the PVF/starch and PVF/SiO2 
foams obtained in the present study are not affected by the concentrations of either 
wheat starch or silica particle when they are served as the pore-forming agent. (7) The 
water desorption rates of PVF/starch foams increase with the increase of wheat starch 
concentration, however, the water desorption rates of PVF/SiO2 foams remain largely 
unchanged when different concentrations of silica particles produced by the 
acidification of water glass solution served as the pore-forming agent in the present 
study.
