2affecting the foot [1-7]. The force components are
classified as vertical, anterior/posterior shear, and
mediolateral shear identifying foot pressures. Pressure
analysis of the foot while standing and walking has
significantly progressed in past decade. While some
authors have assessed the mechanical properties of insole
materials [8-10]. Some studies have been concerned with
the efficacy and appropriate design of insole components
to provide rear foot cushioning [11-13]. Although it is a
complex and multifaceted syndrome, one design
requirement for such devices is that the location of the
cushioning material should match the regions of high
pressure. The present study describes a method to
facilitate this approach.
In the past, we focused on the integrated techniques
of reverse engineering, rapid prototyping and
biomechanics in developing rehabilitative insole [14-15].
In the paper, a customized adaptive multi-airbag foot
pressure redistribution insole design and manufacturing
methodologies using image-based rapid pressure
measuring system is proposed. The flow chart of whole
system is composed by three parts as shown in Figure 1,
one is measurement devices, another is computer
interface software, the other is product manufacturing.
The in-house made measurement devices are constructed
with a body weight spring scale and an image-based
foot/ground contact pattern identification scanning
mechanism. The computer interface software can
determine the foot boundary and size of shoe, and
calculate the regional weight bearing distribution.
Referring to product manufacturing, an adaptive
multi-airbag insole is fabricated.
2. Measuring devices
Since the body weight was supported by foot, the
blood will be blocked into the blood capillary of sole and
it will generate the different color foot/ground contact
pattern owing to the difference of local contact pressure.
The foot pressure is larger when the scanning color is
closer to white. Therefore, we assemble a scanner and
hook spring to obtain the foot images and weight. The
foot images transfer to the binary code and to calculate
the foot–pressure in region based above the principle.
Following the data from measuring system, each airbag of
insole can be adjusted pressure according to image-based
rapid pressure measuring system. The procedure provides
a more objectively and quickly quantitative analysis.
There are two devices in foot pressure measuring
system. One is a body weight spring scale and another is
image-based foot/ground contact pattern identification
scanning mechanism. Design mechanism of measuring
system is shown in Figure 2. The total weight is obtained
by spring scale according the Hook’s law, while the foot 
image is registered by a scanner. The measuring system of
foot pressure is actually assembled as shown in Figure 3.
We measure weight and scan foot image in a real case as
shown in Figure 4a. The image of foot sole is obtained by
the measuring system as shown in Figure 4b.
3. Mathematic transformation model
The basic principle of measuring system is that,
when the body weight was supported by foot, the blood
will be blocked into the blood capillary of sole and it will
generate the different color foot/ground contact pattern
owing to the difference of local contact pressure. We
found that the whiter the color is, the larger the
foot-pressure is. Therefore, we can assume that the total
body weight is proportional to the summation of digital
gray gradient values in all regions and can be described as
follows:
Total body weight 


n
1k
KG (1)
where kG is the gray gradient value of thk region,
which can be determined by following equation:

 

m
i j
ji
k gG
1 1
,

(2)
where j,ig is the gray gradient value of pixel in (i, j), i
and j are the x and y coordinates. m and  are
maximum values in x and y coordinates in thk region.
In this case, total body weight can also be expressed as
following equation:
Total body weight 


n
1k
kW (3)
where kW is the distributed load in thk region and it
can be computed as follows:
W)

G

k
k
k   (4)
where f is a modified factor adjusted by all conditions
stated as follows:
f = f (insole material, walking inhabit, sport, climbing,
healthy condition...) (5)
Then, the redistributed pressure in each region can be
estimated as follows:
k
k
k
A
W
P  (6)
where kA is the area of thk region.
The foot images are transferred to the binary code
of gray gradient. The foot pressure in each region is then
calculated based on above equations. Therefore, the
pressure of each airbag can be adjusted according to the
data obtained by this mathematic transformation model.
Although the mathematic transformation model cannot
exactly predict the local foot pressure, it can effectively
and rapidly calculate the regional foot pressure.
