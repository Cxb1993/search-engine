Abstract 
In order to reach the goal of fully recycling 
the sewage sludge ash, nano-SiO2 and 
micro-sized carbon powder are applied to 
improve the properties of clay-sewage sludge 
ash tile specimens. The effects of kiln 
temperatures and the amounts of nano-SiO2 
additive on the properties of tile specimens 
are also investigated in this study. 
Furthermore, different micro-analyses are 
used to investigate the influences of the 
additions of nano-SiO2 and micro-sized 
carbon powder on the interior structure and 
mechanism of tile bodies. Test results indicate 
that nano-SiO2 has a great impact on the 
shrinkage for potter’s clay-incinerated sewage 
sludge ash (ISSA) tile specimens, but on the 
weigh loss of ignition for porcelain clay-ISSA 
tile specimens. The study also indicates that 
the addition of nano-SiO2 can effectively 
improve the bending strength of tile 
specimens, especially for porcelain clay-ISSA 
tile specimens.

二、研究動機及緣由 
    對下水污泥灰的處理，主要有掩埋、熱
處理（焚化）、堆肥及土地利用等，由於現
有掩埋場無法消化未來龐大的污泥量，因此
污泥處置應朝向減量化、資源化等方向進
行，來降低對環境之衝擊。過去研究發現，
Nano SiO2應用於瓷土瓷磚可改善吸水率、
抗折強度及地磚體結晶物特性，有助於提升
未達熟化溫度情況下污泥灰/瓷土瓷磚之性
質，並增加其污泥運用於瓷磚之可行性（林
登峰，2006）。並有研究顯示對於奈米材料
提出Ca-αSiAlON的陶瓷製法，利用Nano混
合物的良好特性，改進原有的能力，發現
Ca-αSiAlON製造法的Si3N4可以依大小排
列，且比lowe製法的Si3N4具有更高的硬度
（Iguchi，2003）。對於製作地磚原料如黏
土、陶土和瓷土等與污泥混合製作之污泥地
磚，所產生之性質亦有所不同，其中又以瓷
土製成之成品較為細緻、硬度較高，研究發
現污泥瓷土瓷磚的性質在許多方面均優於
污泥黏土瓷磚，如收縮率、抗折強度等
（Lin，2001）。研究發現窯燒溫度會增加
污泥瓷磚體的抗折強度，但窯燒溫度達
1150℃以上，地磚體開始產生發泡現象，致
使抗折強度降低，同時瓷磚尺寸收縮率亦有
減少現象（羅煥琳，2006）。廣泛應用奈米
材料於污泥再利用之領域，對於下水道污泥
減量、資源化及再利用材料化等方案，始能
因應未來永續發展之精神，轉廢棄物為新資

奈米材料收縮率介於 3.9%~5.8%；添加 2%
奈米材料介於 5.9%~8.8%，而上昇幅度
2.0%~3.0%。圖 1(b)為陶土污泥瓷磚，添加
0%奈米材料收縮率介於 3.4%~4.0%；添加
2%奈米材料介於 5.2%~6.5%，而上昇幅度
1.8%~2.5%。圖 1(c)為瓷土污泥瓷磚，添加
0%奈米材料收縮率介於 4.4%~4.7%；添加
2%奈米材料介於 5.3%~7.1%，而上昇幅度
0.9%~2.4%。由上述的現象可發現奈米材料
受到表面效應與小尺寸效應所產生的低熔
點性質，在較低的窯溫時有助於液態燒結現
象的產生；並且比較奈米材料對不同土質污
泥瓷磚收縮率之影響，發現三種土質污泥瓷
磚以黏土污泥瓷磚收縮率受奈米材料影響
程度最大。 
    比較污泥灰取代對不同土質污泥瓷磚
收縮率之影響。由圖 1(a)顯示當添加 1%奈
米材料收縮率會隨著污泥取代量的增加而
有下降的現象；但圖 1(b)顯示當添加 1%奈
米材料收縮率會隨著污泥取代量的增加有
上昇的趨勢，由圖 1(c)亦可發現相同現象產
生；顯示奈米材料添加於黏土污泥瓷磚中收
縮率影響較陶土與瓷土污泥瓷磚大。

    圖 2(a)、圖 2(b)及圖 2(c)為使用微米級
碳粉添加劑之收縮率試驗結果。圖 2(a)收縮
率介於 0.8%~2.4%；圖 2(b)介於
3.4%~6.4%；圖 2(c)則介於 6.8%~10.6%；觀
察圖 2(a)、圖 2(b)在不同窯燒溫度下發現，
窯溫 1100℃上昇幅度較窯溫 1000℃時上昇
2.6%~4.1%，得知收縮率會隨著窯燒溫度的
增加而上昇。圖 2(c)收縮率因固態燒結現象
影響而有些許下降的情形出現。比較奈米材
料添加量的影響，由圖 2(a)可觀察出未添加
奈米材料的碳粉污泥瓷磚收縮率在
0.8%~0.9%之間；添加 1%奈米材料的碳粉
污泥瓷磚收縮率在 1.2%~1.5%之間；添加
2%奈米材料的碳粉污泥瓷磚收縮率在
1.6%~2.2%之間；添加 3%奈米材料的碳粉
污泥瓷磚收縮率在 1.8%~2.4%之間，可以得
知奈米材料添加量的增加，收縮率增加的幅
度在 1.0%~1.5%，觀察圖 2(b)及圖 2(c)皆可
發現類似情況。

3. 吸水試驗分析 
    圖 5(a)、圖 5(b)及圖 5(c)可發現黏土污
泥瓷磚吸水率介於 0.09%~0.6%；陶土污泥
瓷磚吸水率介於 17.04%~19.78%；瓷土污泥
瓷磚吸水率介於 5.42%~12.56%。上述發現
陶土污泥瓷磚吸水率較其他兩者土質都
高。比較污泥灰對不同土質吸水率之影響，
由圖 5(a)、圖 5(b)及圖 5(c)發現，隨著污泥
取代量的增加黏土污泥瓷磚吸水率有上昇
的現象，但相較於陶土與瓷土污泥瓷磚之吸
水率，黏土污泥瓷磚吸水率僅 1%以下，顯
示污泥灰取代黏土能有效促使磚體趨於緻
密現象。比較添加奈米材料對不同土質污泥
瓷磚吸水率之影響，圖 5(b)添加 0%奈米材
料吸水率介於 17.8%~19.8%；添加 1%奈米
材料介於 17.6%~19.6%；添加 2%奈米材料
介於 17.5%~19.4%；添加 3%奈米材料吸水
率介於 17.0%~18.0%，比較黏土與瓷土污泥
瓷磚吸水率皆發現上述試驗結果趨勢，由上
述試驗結果顯示，奈米材料對污泥瓷磚的液
態燒結現象有促進和增強的效果，促使磚體
趨於密緻。

    由圖 9(a)顯示添加 0%奈米材料磨耗率
介於 0.028%~0.036%；添加 1%奈米材料介
於 0.025%~0.034%；添加 2%奈米材料
0.024%~0.030%；0.022%~0.029%，可發現
黏土污泥瓷磚磨耗率會隨著奈米材料添加
量的增加而下降，而比較陶土與瓷土污泥瓷
磚磨耗率，亦可發現相同產生現象，顯示奈
米材料有助於污泥瓷磚磨耗率的降低，其中
又以瓷土污泥瓷磚磨耗率為最低。

    圖 10(b)可發現添加 0%奈米材料磨耗
率在 0.022%~0.024%；添加 1%奈米材料磨
耗率在 0.014%~0.020%；添加 2%奈米材料
磨耗率在 0.013%~0.018%；添加 3%奈米材
料磨耗率在 0.01%~0.015%；顯示添加奈米
材料有助於降低磨耗率，亦可從圖 10(b)及
圖 10(c)發現相同狀態。比較窯燒溫度對污
泥瓷磚之影響，當窯溫 1000℃時，磨耗率
介於 0.053%~0.058%；而窯溫達 1100℃時，
磨耗率介於 0.01%~0.024%，可發現窯燒溫
度的上昇有助於提高瓷磚耐磨性質相對加
強耐久性質。 
    圖 10(a)、圖 10(b)及圖 10(c)整體而言
可發現添加碳粉之污泥瓷磚隨著窯燒溫度

    圖 13(a) 可以比較出在 1100℃時，磚體
的峰值有明顯高於 1000℃，顯示受到窯溫
上升的影響，磚體結晶的狀況隨著窯溫的提
高而趨向結晶緊密，且在結晶產物上出現
Albite。由圖 13(b)可發現隨著窯燒溫度的增
加，因瓷磚體矽化的現象，波峰值有趨於降
低的現象產生。圖 13(c)中整體可以發現在
1100℃磚體之 Quartz 結晶體產物峰值較
小，同時亦發現 Cristobalite 礦物結產生，
顯示磚體於溫度 1100℃被熔融後晶型重新
排列所致。

   圖 13 各土質對污泥瓷磚磨耗率之結果 
 
    由圖 14 顯示碳粉瓷磚在 1000℃，且碳
粉添加量 2%時，SiO2會隨溫度的升高而峰
值有下降的趨勢；此現象是由於污泥灰中所
含晶相主要以石英物種為主，在燒結溫度至
1100℃以上時，因溫度與助融劑的作用，導
致石英的熔點降低，使 SiO2 晶相物種逐漸
被破壞。並可發現當溫度升高至 1100℃時，
碳峰值起伏較 1000℃時高，顯示窯燒溫度
有助於碳的燒結作用。

Abstract 
In this study, incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) is mixed with cement in a fixed ratio of 4:1 for use as a 
stabilizer to improve the strength of soft, cohesive, subgrade soil. Five different ratios (in weight percentage: 
0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, and 16%) of ISSA/cement admixture are mixed with cohesive soil to make soil samples. 
In order to understand the influences of admixtures on the soil properties, tests of the pH value, Atterberg 
limits, compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength, and triaxial 
compression were performed on those samples. The study shows that the unconfined compressive strength 
of specimens with the ISSA/cement addition was improved to approximately three to seven times better than 
that of the untreated soil; furthermore, the swelling behavior was also effectively reduced as much as 10% to 
60% for those samples. In some samples, the ISSA/cement additive improved the CBR values by up to 30 
times that of untreated soil. This suggests that ISSA/cement has many potential applications in the field of 
geotechnical engineering.

INTRODUCTION 
Reclamation of sewage sludge has been progressing positively in different research areas and, 
through many applications, this material has been turned into useful building construction materials. 
Tay and Goh (1991) replaced cement with incinerated sewage sludge ash in making concrete, 
thereby improving the workability and compressive strength of concrete. Lin and Weng (2001) 
applied 0% to 50% of incinerated sewage sludge ash as a substitute for clay in order to manufacture 
bricks. They found that sewage sludge ash/clay bricks were able to meet the secondary CNS 
standards for bricks and that the optimum amount of sludge ash to add to the bricks was 20%. Weng 
et al. (2000) studied properties of clay tiles after part of the clay was replaced by incinerated sewage 
sludge ash. They discovered melting behaviors for sludge ash/clay tiles at 1250°C. Furthermore, 
these phenomena of melting became more noticeable as greater amounts of clay were replaced. For 
making sludge ash/clay tiles, the optimum firing temperature in their study was found to be 1050°C.  
In order to widely utilize sludge for different practical applications, Tay and Goh (1991) also 
investigated the chemical and physical properties of ash residues and evaluated possible 
applications in geotechnical areas. In their study of a mixture of coal cinder and fly ash later mixed 
with soil, properties of this treated soil were stable. They also pointed out that soil characteristics 
such as shear strength and settlement were greatly improved. In applying cement to stabilize 
subgrade soil, K’ezdi (1979) found that mixing cement with untreated soil generated hydration 
reactions which lessened the pH values, the amount of Ca+, and the free Ca(OH)2 of the mixture, 
which can be attributed to pozzolanic reactions (Little 1995, K’ezdi 1979). The plasticity index (PI) 
of the treated soil decreased with increasing cement additions. The PI value also decreased with the 
increase of the hardening times of admixtures. Additionally, the cement curing time affected the 
unconfined compressive strength of the treated soil and was found to be the main factor in the 
strength development of the stabilized soil. In general, the cohesion, c, and the shear strength of the 
stabilized soil improved with increasing cement additions.   
Fly ash can be used as pozzolana and react with calcium materials in manufacturing calcium silicate 
or aluminum silicate hydrates during the process of polymerization. Processes used in making those 
hydrates are similar to the hydration mechanisms of Portland cement, and both result in the same

Characteristics of materials 
Soil  
In this study, untreated, soft, subgrade soil that is 60% to 70% composed of clay and silt is 
categorized as silty clay. Soil categorization tests that follow the standard of ASTM D1883-87 and 
the classifications of AASHTO refer the untreated subgrade soil to the A-4 category, which stands 
for low-plasticity silty clay. In accordance with the AIIS-181 standards, subgrade soil is 
distinguished into three grades. Based on the 95%CBR value of untreated subgrade soil, soil 
obtained from tests conducted in this study was graded a 2. As such, the untreated subgrade soil was 
grouped into grade 1. This means that the subgrade soil is very poor insofar as engineering 
applications are concerned. 
Cement 
Portland cement (type I) was used in this study. The main components of cement are CaO, SiO2, 
Al2O3, and Fe2O3. Other components included MgO, Na2O, K2O, and SO3. 
Sludge Ash 
The main components of sewage sludge ash as determined by EDS analysis are: Si, Al, Fe, and O2 
with weight percentage ratios of 24.88, 10.47, 7.34, and 39.65, respectively. It is known that the 
oxides which primarily carry out pozzolanic reactions are SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3, which are related 
to these main components of sludge ash. Misra (1998) noticed that increasing the calcium contained 
in the oxide for fly ash accelerated the pozzolanic reaction. He also showed that fly ash improved 
the strength of clay. In this study, the amount of Ca in ISSA is about 8%, which is greater than that 
in fly ash (2% to 5%). This implies that ISSA has the potential to improve properties of cohesive 
soil. Furthermore, the test results of TCLP for sewage sludge ash dried at 105℃ showed that the 
leached metal concentrations were 0.03, 0.25, 0.24, 0.54, and 16.75mg/L for Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, and Zn, 
respectively. The study showed that the TCLP test results are much lower than the maximum 
solubility limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency in the Republic of China. 
pH values  
As proposed by Eades and Grim in early 1970, the optimum modification mixture (OMM) is 
obtained after combining the soil and the admixtures and evaluating the variations in pH values. 
The admixture in this article was mixed by ISSA and cement with a fixed ratio of 4:1. Then, using 
the weight percentages of 0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, and 16%, five different admixture proportions were 
mixed with cohesive soil. The liquid-to-solid ratio (deionized water/soil with admixture) was kept at 
1:1 for the pH value tests, which were performed for test specimens cured at 3 hours and at 3, 7, 14, 
21, and 28 days to find the optimum admixture ratio. Figure 1 displays the relationship between pH 
values and curing ages for cohesive soil with different amounts of ISSA/cement added. For all 
solutions tested, the pH values increased with increasing amounts of ISSA/cement added at the 
initial setting period. For example, the pH value for 2% admixture was 8.7, greater than that in 
untreated cohesive soil by 1.2; the pH was 11.2 for the 4% admixture, which was much higher than 
that in untreated soil. However, the pH value for the 16% admixture showed very limited increase. 
Moreover, the pH values for different admixtures are reduced with the extension of curing age. This 
phenomenon was caused by the calcium saturation principle of pH values and the mechanism of 
stabilization. The study showed that amounts of calcium oxide found in ISSA and cement are 9% 
and 62%, respectively. Calcium gradually decreased as the stabilization progressed. Hence, pH 
values decreased with the decrease in calcium. As a result of decreases in the amount of calcium, 
the initial high level of calcium received from the admixture slowly decreased to a state of low 
calcium in the ISSA/cement soil specimens. This also resulted in a decrease of calcium saturation. 
Meanwhile, the properties of the reaction products of silica and calcium silicate corresponding to a 
weak alkaline, which caused a reduction in pH values as curing time increased. Hence, the pH 
values at 28 days kept decreasing for all the cases studied. Among these, pH values for the 2% 
admixture were even less than that of the untreated soil at 28 days.

admixture (between 2% and 8%) is added. However, the dry side density is decreased for the 16% 
admixture. Similar observations are made for the wet side of the compaction curve.  
Furthermore, when the peaks of the compaction curves for different admixtures are examined, the 
admixture is seen to efficiently reduce the over-absorption of moisture caused by the untreated soil. 
This moisture over-absorption phenomenon correlates with the reduction in bearing capacity of the 
soil. In addition, the interlocking forces among soil particles on the dry side of the compaction 
curve increase slightly, which is attributed to the increase in the strength of the specimens. 
Additionally, while the ISSA/cement additives lower the optimum moisture content and the total 
stresses are conserved among the soil particles, the effective soil stress rises with the decrease of 
water-generated stress. Therefore, the admixture of ISSA/cement improves the interlocking forces 
among soil particles.

Unconfined compressive strength test (UCS Test)  
The relationships between various amounts of ISSA/cement additions and the unconfined 
compressive strength of specimens at different curing ages are shown in figure 5. The unconfined 
compressive strength of ISSA/cement soil specimens increased with admixture amount for curing 
ages below 3 days. The increased strength is between 2 and 4 times that of the strength of untreated 
soil. On the one hand, for large amounts of ISSA/cement admixtures (8% and 16%), the unconfined 
compressive strengths of specimens improve with the help of air moisture; on the other hand, for 
smaller amounts of admixtures (2% and 4%), the unconfined compressive strength of the specimens 
increase less as the curing time increases. However, with the help of the reaction caused by the 
pozzolanic materials in the ISSA and the product of hydrated cement, CH, large increments of the 
unconfined compressive strengths of the specimens with small amounts of admixtures were 
obtained at 56 days. Miller and Zaman (2000) studied the effects of three different kinds of cement 
kiln dusts (CKD) on the stabilization treatments. They found that, when cured for 14 days, the 
unconfined compressive strengths of specimens with four proportions of CKD additives were 2% 
less than those of untreated specimens. However, the rate of increase in strengths developed slowly 
for those specimens with CKD additives, yielding results similar to those specimens with small 
amounts of admixtures added in this study. Moreover, figure 5 indicates that, when the curing time 
reaches 90 days, the rate of increase in strength will have increased greatly for all specimens tested. 
The best increments are seen for specimens with 2% and 4% admixtures added. Yet again, the 
strength increments are attributed to the accelerated reaction between the pozzolanic materials in 
the ISSA and CH.

Triaxial compression tests 
Unconsolidated, Undrained, and Unsaturated (UUU) triaxial tests were carried out following the 
ASTM D2850-87 specifications. Soil samples with admixtures of ISSA/cement were axially loaded 
to an effective confining pressure of 25 kPa and 50 kPa. Stress-strain relationships are shown in 
figure 8 for the confining pressure at 25 kPa. When stress reaches its maximum for untreated soil, 
the strain is about 10%. However, after admixture is added to soil, the shear failure mode of the 
ISSA/cement soil samples is close to brittle failure. Furthermore, the shear stresses for samples with 
0% and 2% admixtures nearly equal. The maximum stresses obtained for 8% and 16% admixtures 
are also nearly equal. Similar stress-strain relationships for the confining pressure at 50 kPa are 
illustrated in figure 9. The maximum shear stress is observed for samples with 8% admixture added. 
Moreover, results for specimens with 16% admixture added are comparable to those samples with 
8% admixture. Minimum strains for both additive amounts are seen where the maximum stresses 
are observed. On the whole, maximum shear strengths are observed for soft subgrade soil with 8% 
and 16% admixtures. 
Analysis of microstructure 
In this study, an admixture of ISSA/cement is used as a stabilizer to improve soft subgrade soil and, 
since ISSA contains SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 and possesses the properties of pozzolana, it can also 
better the engineering characteristics of the untreated soil. Figure 10 displays the results of the SEM 
analyses for the 16% and 2% ISSA/cement samples. Crystalline phases such as ettringite and 
monosulfoaluminate hydrates are seen after the admixture of ISSA/cement is added to the soil. 
Using X-ray diffraction together with JCPD database and the map-overlay method, figure 11 
displays the diffraction peak values of reaction products for 16% sludge ash/cement added at 
different curing ages. The diffraction peak values of CH and C-S-H differed as marked. Also, the 
strengths of hydrates produced by C-S-H and others reduced with an increase in curing age. The 
diffraction peaks for calcium hydroxide products and calcium silicate hydrates are observed at 
diffraction angles, 2θ, of 18o and 50o. Higher peak values were detected at shorter curing ages. 
Moreover, when the cure time was between 28 and 56 days, 2θ was equal to 55o and the CH 
hydration products as well as the peak values clearly decreased. The peak value even dissipated 
when the sample was cured for 90 days. Thus, Ca2+ provides a source which gradually produces 
calcium silica hydrates, which enhances the bonding forces among soil particles. 
CONCLUSIONS  
In this study, the ISSA/cement is utilized as a soil stabilizer and effectively improves the basic 
properties of soft subgrade soil. Test results of samples with ISSA/cement admixtures indicate via 
PI values that the soil type changed from mid-to-low plastic soil (CL) to CH soil. The tests also 
show that soil swelling is clearly improved as more ISSA/cement admixtures are added. 95%CBR 
values for soils with 8% and 16% admixtures are 30 times better than that of untreated soft soil. 
Furthermore, unconfined compression tests show proportionally increase in long-term strength for
