amorphous silicon hydrogenated (a-Si:H) solar 
cells due to its low resistivity and high optical 
transparency [2].  Beside atomic mixing induced 
by particles hitting the surface of growing film, 
excited particles interact with the ITO, leading to 
processes such as reduction of metal oxide, 
diffusion of metal into growing into the growing 
a-Si:H and oxidation at the interface.  The 
processor of preparation ITO thin film is high. In 
order to overcome this problem zinc oxide (ZnO) 
should be a reliable and cost effective alternative 
to impurity-doped In2O3 as an anti-reflection 
coating for Si based solar cells. 
 
ZnO films typically exhibit n-type 
conduction due to native defects such as oxygen 
vacancies or zinc interstitial during Zn-rich 
deposition environment [3-5] and is a candidate 
material for a transparent electrode of thin-film 
solar cells due to its high transmittance (80~90 %) 
in the long-wavelength region and simplicity of 
process [6].  Whether the conduction of ZnO 
film, obtaining sufficiently low resistivity (c.a 
10-2-10-3 Ωcm for undoped ZnO films) is very 
difficulty. Therefore the Impurity-doped ZnO 
films such as Ga:ZnO [7] and Al:ZnO [8] were 
considered for decreasing the resistivity of ZnO 
films. Recently, GfE has developed a novel 
AZOY target that dopes a small amount of Y2O3 
besides Al2O3 in ZnO [9]. The aim is stable the 
process in deposited ZnO thin film and high 
target material conductivity. To improve the 
transparence and electrical resistivity of ZnO thin 
film, the Ion beam sputtering (IBS) is used to 
deposition ZnO thin film becoming more and 
more the alternative to the conventional plasma 
configuration because it permits independent 
control of beam energy, direction, and current 
density.  The deposition pressure is very low (< 
5 x 10-4 torr).  Therefore, thermalization of 
sputtered materials can be avoided and energy of 
depositing particles is higher than in plasma 
sputtering.  
 
Experiment 
 The ZnO was prepared by the ion beam 
sputtering (IBS) system under varied parameters, 
such as variations in the substrate temperature, 
ion source voltage and ion beam current. The 
target of 99.95 % AZOY was used and soda lime 
glass was used as a substrate.  All measured 
films reported below were grown at 100°C-300°C, 
which gives the best crystalline quality in 
conjunction with the lowest attainable resistivity.  
The initial base pressure of the vacuum chamber 
was pumped down to lower than 1 x 10-6 torr 
before the film depositions began. The samples 
were deposited to various thicknesses ranging 
from 130 nm to 150 nm.  The crystal structure 
was determined by a Brooks D8 Cu Kα. X-ray 
diffractometer (XRD).  Carries and mobility of 
ZnO film measurements were done on a physical 
property measurement system (PPMS) coupled 
with Lakeshore 7500 Hall measurement system 
using a six-probe Hall bar configuration. 
Electrical sheet resistance of the samples was 
determined from the four-point probe method. 
Optical absorption was measured on a 
at temperature as low as 150oC. The performed 
measurements show that films with sheet 
resistivity around 10-3 Ω-cm can be obtained 
choosing the appropriate conditions. This is an 
important result for ZnO films with high 
transparency, potential applications. At the same 
time, the parameter of 750V, 200oC and 20mA is 
the best condition for deposition ZnO film used 
AZOY target in DIBS system in this experiment.
