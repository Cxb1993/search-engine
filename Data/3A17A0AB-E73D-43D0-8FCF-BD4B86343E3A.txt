2Electrochemical Impedance Characterization and Photovoltaic
Performance of N719 Dye-sensitized Solar Cells using Quaternized
Ammonium Iodide Containing Polyfluorene Electrolyte Solutions
Abstract
This study develops a series of titanium oxide electrode -based N719
dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using quaternized ammonium iodide containing
main-chain and star-shaped polyfluorene (MPF-E and SPF-E) electrolyte solutions.
The electrochemical impedance and photovoltaic properties of the polyfluorene
electrolyte-based DSSCs were studied and compared to those of the poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO) electrolyte-based DSSCs. As with the PEO electrolyte-based DSSCs,
the recombination impedance increased  with increasing polymer content for the
MPF-E electrolyte-based DSSCs, whereas the photovoltaic performance did
otherwise. Nevertheless, the reduction in the photovoltaic p roperties was not
significant for the SPF-E electrolyte-based DSSCs. The electrochemical impedance
and photovoltaic properties of the different polymer -based DSSCs are also discussed
as a function of the polymer concentration.
Keywords: dye sensitized solar cell; photovoltaic cell; polymer electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention because of
their low cost, possible fabrications of flexible devices, and relatively efficient
devices for the photovoltaic conversion of solar energy [1-3].  A DSSC consists of
components such as a titanium oxide (TiO2) layer based photo-electrode, adsorbed
photosensitive dye, an iodide/triiodine redox couple in solvent as electrolyte, and a
Pt-coated counter electrode [1-3].  During the operation of DSSC, the photosensitive
dye absorbs solar light.  The dye in photo-excited state then injects electrons and
holes into the TiO2 and electrolyte, respectively.  Electrons transport through the
TiO2 and holes through the electrolyte to their respective electrodes, where they are
collected in an external circuit [1-3].
A stable and effective oxidation and reduction reaction influences
photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSC, making the balanced electrons and
holes exist stably between the films in cell. Accordingly, improving the composition
and structure of the electrolyte material to enhance the photoelectric conversion
4the catalytic enhancement of hole transfer to the counter electrode by the polyfluorene
electrolyte can further reduce recombination at the TiO2 electrode/electrolyte interface.
Therefore, enhanced photovoltaic performances of DSSCs would be achieved using
this type of polymer electrolytes. Furthermore, this study also includes the
investigation of star-shaped structure effect on ionic charge transport and photovoltaic
performances of DSSCs. The SPF-E material with a unique structure is expected to
reduce polymer chain aggregation, thus enhancing charge transport in the electrolyte
[34-38]. In this work, DSSCs using the PEO electrolyte solution are also fabricated
for comparison and to further prove the dual-functional (hole and ionic charge
transporting) effect of MPF-E and SPF-E electrolyte solutions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation and characterization of TiO 2 nanoparticle
Titanium butoxide (0.03 mole, Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol (15 mL).
Subsequently, 2 mL of acetylacetone (0.02 mole) was added to the solution and stirred
at room temperature for 60 min.  This was followed by the addition of 20 mL of 80
% acetic acid aqueous solution . The solution was then heated at 80 oC for 5 h with
continuous stirring.  After the solution was cooled to room temperature, the obtained
yellow jelly product was washed repetitively with isopropanol and distilled water,
followed by drying at 100 oC for 12 h.  The dried product was ground into powder
using a mortar and pestle.  The powder was then calcined at 600 oC for 3 h. As a
result, the TiO2 nanoparticle (NTP) samples were obtained. The nanostructure of the
prepared NTPs was analyzed by a cold field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM; Hitachis-4800; operating voltage: 1.5-2.0 kV) and a high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; JEOL JEM-2010) with an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV.  The crystalline structure of the TiO2 materials was evaluated by
a X-Ray diffractometer (XRD; PANalytical X’Pert PRO MPO ) with
monochromatized CuKa (1.5406 Å) radiation.
2.2 Synthesis and characterization of quaternized ammonium iodide containing
polyfluorenes
2.2.1 Polymerization of main-chain polyfluorene electrolyte (MPF-E)
Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic route for MPF -E. The main-chain
polyfluorene (MPF) was synthesized according to the literature via a Suzuki coupling
reaction of compound 1 and compound 2 [39]. The number- and weight-average
molecular weights of MPF are about 7020 and 11934 g/mole . The main-chain
polyfluorene electrolyte MPF-E was synthesized via the quaternization of MPF [39].
The brown solid product yield was 51 %. 1H-NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ[ppm]:
6measured on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC: TA Instruments, DSC-2010) in a
nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 oC/min. Thermo-gravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 oC/min, using a
Thermo-gravimetric Analyzer (TA Instruments, TGA-2050). Ionic conductivities of
the polymer electrolyte solutions were measured using a conductivity meter (Mettler
Toledo S-30).
2.4 Fabrication of DSSCs
To measure photovoltaic properties, a 0.25 cm2 active area of the DSSCs was
fabricated according to the method reported by Uchida et al. and Pavasupree et al.
[41-42]. First, the TiO2 thin film coated substrate was prepared for the DSSC
photoelectrode. The TiO2 thin film electrode was prepared as follows: 1 g of TiO2
material is mixed with 0.4 mL of poly-oxyethylene (10) octylphenyl ether (Triton
X-100) and 5 mL of 5 wt. % acetic acid aqueous solution, and ground mechanically.
The obtained TiO2 paste is coated on the fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO,
sheet resistance 15 Ω/Sq, Solaronix Co.) by the doctor blade method.  After coating,
the thin film electrode is dried at room temperature before sintering at 500 oC for 2 h.
The resulting film with thickness of about 10 m is used as the DSSC photo-electrode.
The surface of the calcined TiO2 electrode is soaked in 0.5 mM of ruthenium dye
(N719 dye, Solaronix Co.) in a acetonitrile/t-butanol (1:1 in vol %) solution.  The
counter electrode is Pt coated indium tin oxide glass.  The liquid electrolyte is
prepared by mixing LiI (0.1M), I2 (0.05M), 4-t-butylpyridine (0.5M) and
1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (1.2 M) into the acetonitrile (3 mL) as a
solvent. An amount of polymer (wt. % of liquid electrolyte) is added to obtain the
polymer electrolyte. PEO (Mw = 300000) is available from Polysciences, USA.
Finally, the N719 dye adsorbed photoelectrode and Pt coated electrode are placed next
to each other, and the electrolyte infiltrates the space between the electrodes.  After
an encapsulation process, a solar cell is obtained.
2.5 Optical, electrochemical impedance, and photovoltaic propert ies
measurements of DSSCs
UV-vis absorption spectrum of the N719 dye adsorbed TiO2 thin film electrode
was measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 X with a photodiode array detector.
The amount of N719 dye adsorbed by the NTPs was analyzed by a UV-visible
spectrophotometer (Jasco V-550). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements of DSSCs were carrier out usi ng a potentiostat/galvanostat
(PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie).  The frequency range explored was from 0.01
Hz to 1 MHz, using the photo-anode and the Pt-coated ITO glass as working and
83.2 UV-vis absorption spectrum of dye-anchored TiO2 thin film electrode
FE-SEM and XRD were utilized to characterize nanostructure and crystalline
structure analysis of the prepared NTPs, respectively.  The FE-SEM image shows
that the mean particle size of the NTPs is approximately 23.5 nm [44]. The X-ray
diffraction patterns of NTPs exhibit peaks that correspond to the tetragonal anatase
phase, indicating the formation of NTPs with a pure anatase phase [44-46]. Figure 2
shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of N719 dye, TiO 2 thin film electrode, and
dye-anchord TiO2 thin film electrode.  The N719 dye in the co-solvent of acetonitrile
and t-butanol (1:1 in vol. %) shows bands at 534, 381, 313, and 299 nm. The bands
in the visible region at 534 and 381 nm, and in the UV region at 313 and 299 nm, are
caused by metal to ligand charge transfer transitions, and ligand -centered charge
transfer transitions, respectively  [47]. A UV-vis absorption band with a 280 nm
maximum is present for the TiO2 nanoparticle NTP. The UV-vis absorption
spectrum shows a bandgap of 3.3 eV for TiO 2 NTPs. Absorption intensity of the
TiO2 thin film electrode in the visible region also enhances after anchoring with the
N719 dye. The amount of anchored N719 dye is approximately 4.18 mol/g [44].
3.3 Ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes
The ionic conductivities of polymer electrolyte solutions as a function of
polymer content are shown in Figure 3. For the PEO based polymer electrolyte
solutions, the conductivity decreases significantly with increasing polymer content.
A high polymer content for the PEO electrolyte solution results in reduced free ion
concentration [21].  Moreover, electrolyte viscosity enhances with increasing
polymer content, thus resisting triiodide/iodide diffusion [20].  Consequently, ionic
conductivity reduces drastically as the polymer content increases.  However, MPF-E,
and SPF-E electrolytes solution show different conductivity behavior in comparison
with the PEO solution electrolyte. With increasing polyfluorene content, the
dissociation of the quaternized ammonium iodide enhances the anion concentration
and the ionic conductivity, while the polymer matrix prohibits the movement of ionic
charge and hence decreases the io nic conductivity of the electrolyte. As a result, the
ionic conductivity of the polyfluorene electrolyte solutions remains nearly constant
for the polymer contents lower than 2 wt. %, and the conductivity decreases more
significantly for the polymer contents higher than 4 wt. %. Moreover, a higher ionic
conductivity was observed for the SPF -E electrolyte solution than for the MPF -E
electrolyte solution. This indicates that the molecular weight of the polymer and the
viscosity of the electrolyte solution play an important role in determining the ionic
conductivity of polymer electrolyte solutions. A high content of alkyfluorene -based
10
polymer content, whereas the photovoltaic performances decreased drastically with
increasing polymer content. The quaternized ammonium cation in the polymer chain
coordinates with the iodide anion, and the molecular motion coupling between the
polymer main-chain and side-chain moiety have not been proven to promot e iodide
anion charge transport in the electrolyte solution. In terms of photovoltaic
performances, the SPF-E electrolyte-based DSSCs varied only slightly as the polymer
content increased when compared the MPF-E-based DSSCs. This is due to the fact
that the ionic conductivity was not significantly decreased for the electrolyte solution
containing high SPF-E contents.  It is concluded that the photovoltaic performances
of DSSC were decreased with increasing polymer content (PEO, MPF-E, or SPF-E) in
the liquid electrolyte.
Additionally, the photovoltaic stability was studied for the different polymer
electrolyte-based DSSCs. Stability under 100 mW/cm2 solar light illumination from
the AM1.5 solar simulator  were recorded. However, the photovoltaic performances
decreased drastically with increasing operating time.  Stabilities of the quaternized
ammonium iodide containing MPF-E and SPF-E solution electrolytes based DSSCs
were not quite different from those of the PEO solution electrolyte based DSSCs.
The presence of the high molecular weight polymer in solution state could not
suppress the evaporation and leakage of low-boiling materials in the electrolyte. As
a result, the conjugated polyfluorene electrolytes with both hole and ionic charge
transporting moieties have not been proved to be helpful for promoting charge
balance and operational stability of the polymer solution based DSSCs.  Star-shaped
effect on the stability of photovoltaic performances was not observed either for the
SPF-E solution electrolyte based DSSC.
4. Conclusion
This study develops a series of N719 dye -based sensitized solar cells using
quaternized ammonium iodide containing main -chain and star-shaped polyfluorene
electrolyte solutions. The ionic conductivity decreased with increasing polymer
content for the MPF-E and SPF-E electrolytes. As the polymer content in the
electrolyte solution increased, the electrochemical impedance increased and the
photovoltaic performance decreased for the MPF -E-, SPF-E-, and PEO-based DSSCs.
The quaternized ammonium cation in the polymer chain coordinates with the iodide
anion, and the molecular motion coupling be tween the polymer main-chain and
side-chain moiety has not been proven to promote iodide anion charge transport and
balance in the electrolyte solution. Apart from that, the side chain ionic moiety
effect on the charge transport and balance in gel-type conjugated polymer electrolytes
