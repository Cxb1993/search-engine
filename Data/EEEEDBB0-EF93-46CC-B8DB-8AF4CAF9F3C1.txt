non-homogeneous. Nicholas [3], Ramesh [4] and
Gray[5] discussed the evolution of this
experimental method and recent advances.
The dynamic strength enhancement of
concrete has attracted great interest in structural
design due to the broad applications of concrete in
impact and blast loading environment. A critical
review on the compressive behaviour of concrete
at high strain-rates was conducted by [6], where
various experimental techniques and test results
were summarized in Fig.2, in terms of the ratio
dynamic strength over qusi-static strength in
uniaxial compression. Two distinct types of
behaviour can be observed: The first one shows a
linear dependence of the ratio with log( ). The
second one is a sharp rise in the rate dependence.
The limit between the two is around 1 13 10 s  
in compression.
Recently, [7] adopted SHPB to conduct
research at strain rates 2.5×102~ 1.7×103s-1,
because the dynamic compression strength of
concrete at very high strain very sharply increases.
However, SHPB testing is suitable for the
one-dimensional stress problem. During the
experiment, the specimen is unrestrained, so the
pressure on the specimen cannot be too high, as it
can withstand a limited strain rates. To achieve a
high confinement pressure and high strain rates,
Grote employed the plate impact test, because plate
impact testing is suitable for plane strain problems,
and able to provide high strain rates at high
pressure; lateral pressure of 1~1.5GPa, dynamic
compression with a strain rate of 104s -1,
pinpoint SHPB testing, and lateral confinement
effects, which cause dynamic increase factors of
the concrete to obvious increase. Regarding this, [8]
expressed serious concern about the effect of strain
rate between 101 and 104 s−1on the compressive
strength of concrete, challenging the current
understanding of the effect of strain rate on the
compressive behaviour of concrete.
In civil engineering, new structures,
including long-span bridges and high-rise
buildings, are constructed from engineering
materials of increasing strength. Accordingly,
high-strength concrete (HSC), which is designed to
have a strength under compression of over 41 MPa
[9] is extensively employed. The compressive
strength of concrete can be increased by increasing
the strength of the cement paste and improving the
interfacial zone, reducing the potential stress
concentration between the aggregate and the
cement paste. Such an increase can be achieved by
reducing the water to cement ratio, using fine
pozzolanic materials and reducing the coarse
aggregate size. Based on current knowledge,
concrete with a 28 day ultra-high compressive
strength of 150 MPa can be made easily. Reactive
powder concrete (RPC), which was developed by
[10] in recent years, is a unique mixture that is
cured to have an ultra-high compressive strength
(around 200MPa) –higher than that of normal
concrete or high-strength concrete. The main
improvements of RPC involve micro-structural
enhancement, elimination of coarse aggregates;
reduction of the water-to-cement ratio, and
lowering of the CaO-SiO2 ratio by the introduction
of silica components. A compressive strength of
between 200 and 800 MPa, and fracture energy of
between 1200 and 40000 J/m2 [10] are achieved. In
addition, incorporating steel fibres can
substantially increase tensile and bending strength,
as well as impact resistance. Therefore, RPC is
expected to be used to protect military facilities
(3) The radial inertia and friction effects of the
specimen are negligible.
3.1 Experimental principle of SHPB
According to the one dimensional elasticity
wave propagation theory, the governing equation is
as follows:
2 2
2 2 2
0
1x xu u
x c t
 
 
(1)
where xu denotes the axial displacement, and 0c ,
E ,  represent the wave velocity, Young’s
modulus and mass density of the pressure bar.
Solution of Eq.(1) using D’Alembert method is
represented by:
0 0( ) ( )xu f x c t g x c t     (2)
where, f and g are arbitrary functions.
Differentiating Eq.(2) with respect to x and t,
respectively,
I Rf g       (3)
1 0 0( ) ( )I Ru c f g c        (4)
where, I and R denote the axial strain of the
incident and reflected pulses, respectively. The
time derivative of the displacement in the
transmitted bar 0( )xu h x c t   yields
2 0 Tu -c ε (5)
1u and 2u are the particle velocities at the
interfaces. Ignoring the stress wave propagation
effect, the average strain rate for the specimen is:
2 1( ) /S Su u l    (6)
where Sl denotes the original specimen length.
Substituting Eq.(4) and (5) in Eq. (6) yields
0 ( )S I R T
S
c
l
      (7)
Therefore, the calculated average strain of the
specimen is
0
S 0
S
( )
t
I R T
c
dt
l
      (8)
Furthermore, the forces on each face of the
specimen are given by
1 ( )I RF AE    (9)
2 TF AE (10)
where A denotes the cross-sectional area of
pressure bar. The average stress in the specimen is
given by
1 2 ( )
2 2S I R Ts S
F F A
E
A A
       (11)
where sA represents the instantaneous cross
sectional area of the specimen.
In the SHPB testing, the accuracy of the test
results is determined by the stress-strain uniformity
of the specimen. Since the strain signals are
obtained from the incident and transmitted bars.
Therefore, to ensure the effectiveness of the
experiment results requires satisfying the basic
assumptions of the testing. In the past few decades
a number of investigations have been demonstrated
the validity of the assumptions in order to provide
higher analysis precision of experiments. A scheme
to correct for dispersion based on the first mode of
the Pochhammer-Chree dispersion relation was
proposed by Davies [12] and Follansbee [13]. In
their work, the correction was successfully applied
to SHPB testing of ductile metallic materials. A
similar dispersion correction technique was used
by Gong et al. [14] when testing the dynamic
behaviour of concrete. Various modifications were
made by other researchers [15-20]. Further, [21]
conducted a detailed study and suggest that an
optimal length/diameter ratio of the specimen
should be chosen and that a highly polished
specimen-bar interface condition can minimize
both inertia and friction effects.
3.2 Effects of wave dispersion
When the tests are conducted on brittle
materials such as concrete, which comprises
as
 1 22 2 2

If define the normalized phase velocity is
0pc c c , the radius of circular bar is considered
to be r, so the / 2gr r , and ignoring the higher
order term. The Eq (19) is gives
2 2 21 ( )c r  (20)
where is the Poisson’s ratio of the rod, and
2 / k  represents the wavelength. Equation
(20) was deriver by [23] and the curve for
Poisson’s ratio 0.29 is shown in Fig. 4.
On the other hand, Pochhammer-Chress
[24-25] was first established the dispersion relation,
and the tabulated results of Pochhammer-Chress
solution can be found in Bancroft [26]. Figure 4
show the values calculated by Bancroft’s results
for Poisson’s ratio 0.29 and 0.32. It may be seen in
Fig. 4 that for long wavelengths, / 0.1na  , the
normalized phase velocity of longitudinal waves
differs very little from Eq. (20) and Bancroft’s
results for Poisson’s ratio 0.29. For shorter
wavelengths the errors becomes more serious.
In the SHPB testing, oscillations of high
frequency can be expected in the incident wave, as
recorded by strain gauges located approximately at
the middle of the input bar. Because of the pulse
comprise many Fourier components with different
frequencies. Different components propagate at
different velocities according to Fig. 4. So the
shape of pulse changes after propagating a distance.
This leads to wave dispersion. Figure 5 illustrates
typical dynamic strain gage signals measured in
the SHPB apparatus. From Fig.5, it can be
observed that the wave dispersion in the pressure
bar is significant and will increase with the
distance of propagation.
3.3 Methodology for dispersion correction
The main objective of dispersion correction
is to transform the strain gage signals from the
location of measurements back to the specimen-bar
interface by Fourier transform and the dispersion
equation. The method was described by [14] and
summarized as followed.
(1) Determine the number of Fourier
components to be used in the frequency
domain.
(2) From a digitized time domain pulse
determine the total number of points
which would well represent the pulse to
be analyzed. In the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) numerical scheme the
total sampled points is advised to be a
power of 2 to minimize numerical
operations.
(3) Calculate phase velocity along with wave
speed 0c .
(4) Derive the amplitude and phase angle of
each Fourier component.
(5) Determine the phase angle difference due
to wave propagation of a distance x
(6) Convert the signal back into the time
domain the corrected pulse is obtained.
4. Results and discussion
4.1 Quasi-static mechanical properties
Figure 5 plots the compressive strength of
different specimens. The compressive strength of
the specimen without any steel fibre is 173.1MPa;
a steel fibre volume fraction of 1.0% corresponds
the gravel advance, then since the path is long, a
large amount of energy is required. When the
speed of the impact is relatively high and the
duration is short, since not enough time is available
for energy accumulation in the material, only an
increase in stress can provide the required energy,
causing the material fracture strength to increase
with the strain rate. For the RPC, the steel fibres in
the sample hinder the formation and expansion of
cracks, so the rate of increase in strength rate
should exceed that normal concrete: the dynamic
increase factor at high strain rates would thus be
greater. However Fig. 8 displays opposite results,
perhaps because of the excessively large difference
between the static compression strength of the
normal strength concrete and RPC, which causes
the dynamic strength factor in RPC to become
unobvious. Therefore, when the increase in
strength is used to demonstrate the differences
between the two at difference strain rates, as in Fig.
9, the increase in the dynamic stress of the RPC
clearly exceeds that of normal concrete. Regarding
the estimate of the increase in the dynamic factor
of RPC at different strain rates estimates, Eq. (21)
cannot be used, and regressing all of the test results
herein yields a dynamic increase factor of
0.000620.9198R e   .
