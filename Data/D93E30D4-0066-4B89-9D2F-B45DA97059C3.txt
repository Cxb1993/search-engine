ABSTRACT 
The generalized Taguchi capability index "pmC  has been proposed to measure the manufacturing 
performance with asymmetric tolerances.  Investigations on the generalized Taguchi capability index are 
almost focused on sample samples with a normality assumption.  In this project, a natural estimator of "pmC  
is considered.  The limiting distribution and related large sample properties of the considered estimator are 
studied under general populations having fourth central moment exists.  A decision-making procedure based 
on an approximate (1 - α)% lower bound of "pmC  is also constructed.  A demonstrate example is provided 
to illustrate how the proposed procedure may be applied for judging whether the process runs under the 
desirable quality requirement. 
Keywords: approximate lower bound; generalized Taguchi capability index.

tolerance is symmetric, then Aˆ  may be simplified as TX −  and the estimator "pmCˆ  becomes the MLE of 
Cpm discussed by Boyles (1991).  Chen et al. (1999) investigated the statistical properties of the estimated

pmC .  They obtained the exact distribution and the formulae for the r-th moment, expected value, variance, 
and the mean-squared error under the normality assumption.  The natural estimator pmCˆ ′′  can be rewritten

where C = n1/2 d*/σ, K = n 2nS /σ 2, and Y = [max{(d/dU) Z,  (d/dL) Z}]2 with Z = n1/2( X  − T)/σ.  On the 
assumption of normality, the statistic K is distributed as 2 1n−χ , Z is distributed as N(δ0, 1), where δ = 
n1/2(μ − T)/σ.   
Chen et al. (1999) showed that the statistic Z2 follows a non-central chi-square distribution with one 
degree of freedom and non-centrality parameter 20δ .  The distribution of Y is a weighted non-central 
chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom and non-centrality parameter 20δ , under the assumption of 
normality.  The probability density function of Y is expressed as:

The research work in Chen et al. (1999) is based on the traditional distribution frequency approach.  On 
the other hand, Lin et al. (2005) proposed a Bayesian approach based on for assessing process capability.  
Under the assumption of a non-informative prior, Lin et al. (2005) obtained a simple Bayesian procedure for 
process capability assessment, which allows one to proceed with a Bayesian credible interval estimation for 
"
pmC , which is similar to the classical confidence interval using the distribution frequency approach.
