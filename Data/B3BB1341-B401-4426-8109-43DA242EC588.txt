Abstract  
Conductive polymers have shown promising opportunities for many applications because 
of their unique electric properties. Recent, researchers have developed mild polymerization 
techniques by utilizing enzymes, in which are biocatalysts with powerful catalytic activities and 
extreme specificities. However, the efficiency and processibility are still the major 
considerations for enzymatic polymerization. In this project, we have explored the enzymatic 
polymerization of polyaniline (PANI). We investigated the effects of temperature, pH, and 
hydrogen peroxide concentration on the activity of HRP.  The proper conditions for the PANI 
synthesis were also established. Meanwhile, the characterization of the PANI product was 
conducted with UV-vis spectrophotometer, FTIR, SEM, and cyclic voltammetry.  
 
Keywords: HRP, enzymatic polymerization, PANI, conductive polymer
1. Research background 
During the past two decades, conductive polymers have been under intensive research and 
development in both academics and industries world-wide [Papez et al., 1985; Diaz et al., 1988; 
Kumar and Sharma, 1998; Jagur-Grodzinski, 2002 ]. These polymers become conductive upon 
partial oxidation or reduction, a process commonly referred to as doping [Jagur-Grodzinski, 2002; 
HUSH, 2003 ]. The electrical properties of conductive polymers can be reversibly changed over the 
full range of conductivity from insulators to metallic conductors. Among all of the electrically 
conductive polymers, polyaniline ( PANI ) and polypyrrole (PPy) are particularly attractive, in 
which can be easily synthesized by chemical or electrochemical oxidation of aniline and pyrrole 
monomers, respectively [Lux, 1994; Martin, 1995; De Jesus et al., 1997; Maia et al., 2000; Wang et 
al., 2001; Sheng et al., 2004; Laco et al., 2005 ]. In comparison, PANI has moderately high 
conductivity upon doping with acids, good thermal, and oxidative stability [Karakisla et al., 1996 ].  
Although the chemical polymerization is a relatively simple and cheap approach for the 
synthesis of conductive polymer [Pron et al., 1988; Cao et al., 1989; Gomez-Romero et al., 1997; 
Job et al., 2001; Patil et al., 2002 ], electrochemical polymerization has several advantages over 
chemical polymerization since the processes is clean and no toxic oxidants involved, and 
synthesized polymers possess flexible electrical properties [Karakisla et al., 1996 ].  In addition, 
electrochemical polymerization offer the direct grafting of the doped conductive polymer onto 
 5
phenolic monomers [Kim et al., 2003 ].     
Nevertheless, the major limitation of the enzymatic polymerization has been that as soon as 
polymer begins to form in an aqueous solution, it precipitates out, and only very low molecular 
weight polymers are produced. Although a variety of improvements have been made regarding the 
molecular weight of polymer, including modification of monomers, polymerization in organic 
solvents, micelles, reverse micelles, and air-water interface [Liu et al., 1995; Liu et al., 1999 ], the 
products are typically a mixture of different structures of polymers. Furthermore, the electrical and 
optical properties of enzymatically synthesized polymers are still not sufficient for commercial 
applications.  
On the whole, there are also many unexplored dilemma and possibilities regarding conductive 
polymers in the development of biosensors, in particular the appearance of commercial biosensors 
has not yet been widespread to date. Further researches towards the development of novel and 
profitable conductive polymer based biosensors with satisfied linear correlation, quick response, 
good sensitivity, and prolong stability have a long way to go. As for current research on enzymatic 
polymerization, most efforts have been devoted in exploring the possibility of enzyme-catalyzed 
polymerization, or improving polymer structures by modifying the reaction conditions, however, 
few of them concentrate on the improvement of the enzyme stability and also the kinetics of 
enzyme catalyzed polymerizations. Therefore, we expect that, by carrying the experiments in this 
study, we may provide solutions for the current problems, and eventually come up with an idea to 
enhance the efficiency of enzyme catalyzed polymerization and improve its processibility for future 
applications, especially in the field of biosensor development.  
 
2. Experimental methods 
2.1. Chemicals  
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. 
Glutaraldehyde (GA, 25% in water), hydrogen peroxide (35%, v/v), aniline monomer were obtained 
from Merck. All other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were of analytical 
grade, in which were used to prepare buffers and standard solutions in ultra-pure water. 
 
2.2. Polymerization 
 In a certain amount of fresh prepared aniline solution, we added certain amount of HRP and 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After several hours, the reaction was centrifuged and the pellet was 
collected. The pellet was washed with distilled water for several times before being subjected to 
qualification.  
 
2.3. HRP activity analysis with ABTS 
A certain amount of HRP was mixed well with phosphate buffer (PBS) and ABTS reagent 
according to manufacture procedure (PIERCE, Boston, USA). The absorbance under 410 nm was 
 7
PANI. Therefore, the HRP concentration and reaction time should be controlled in order to obtain 
the soluble PANI. 
 
Fig. 5 showed the effect of H2O2 concentration on the polymerization of aniline. Increasing 
H2O2 did not significantly facilitate the polymerization of aniline while its concentration exceeded 3 
mM with the molar ratio of aniline over H2O2 at 1.7. On the other hand, increasing the amount of 
aniline dramatically increased the formation of PANI as shown in Fig. 6(A). Under our 
experimental condition, the concentration of aniline should be above 5 mM and the ratio of aniline 
over H2O2 should be greater than 0.4 to ensure the synthesis of PANI. Fig. 6(A) also indicated too 
much aniline might inhibit the HRP catalyzed polymerization, therefore, we recommended that the 
concentration of aniline be less than 50 mM and the ratio of aniline over H2O2 be lower than 4. Fig. 
6(B) illustrated the SEM images of the precipitated PANI with various aniline concentrations. The 
SEM indicated that PANI was synthesized to form small ball particles with the size of 10 ~ 50 nm 
and then aggregated to precipitate down.       
 
3.4. Characterization of PANI 
The FTIR characteristic bands of PANI that had been previously reported [Zeng and Ko, 1997; 
Cheng and Gross, 2005; Kan et al., 2006 ] were also observed for PANI synthesized with HRP, 
including those C=N and C=C stretching vibrations for quinoid and benzenoid rings at 1591 and 
1506 cm-1, C-N stretching vibrations for benzenoid ring at about 1309 and 1253 cm-1, the plane 
bending vibration of C-H at 1171 cm-1, and the out-of-plane bending vibration of C-H at 827 cm-1 
(Fig. 7).    
 
 As shown in Fig. 8, the visible spectrum of PANI indicated the typical absorbance at 300 nm 
and 500 nm, suggesting the synthesized PANI was dominantly in its pernigraniline form, an 
complete oxidation state. Meanwhile, Fig. 8 also demonstrated that the different H2O2 addition 
strategies did not cause the significant changes for the visible spectrum of PANI while the final 
concentration ratio of aniline over H2O2 was around 1. However, Fig. 9 revealed that pH played the 
significant role on the PANI synthesis as well as controlling the state of the PANI. pH at 4.3 was 
suitable for the polymerization of PANI because it was the optimum value for HRP activity, but pH 
at 3.0 might lead to synthesize the emeraldine form of PANI with the specific absorbance near 700 
nm , which was reported to have the best conductivity. On the other hand, the pernigraniline form of 
PANI was able to be transformed to the emeraldine form by the treatment with HCl (data not 
shown). 
 
 Fig. 10 displayed the cyclic voltammetry behaviors of carbon paste electrode (red line), and 
those blended with enzymatic synthesized PANI with or without HCl treatment (green and blue 
lines, respectively) in the presence of 10 mM potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]). The symmetric  
redox peaks of potassium ferricyanide indicated that the conductivity of the non-HCl-treated PANI 
was much lower than that of carbon paste since the peak current was reduced, however, the PANI

計畫成果自評 
本計畫之研究目的意在探討酵素催化導電性高分子聚苯胺聚合的反應條件﹐並建立聚苯
胺分析方法﹐以期待未來能應用於生物感測電極之製備。具體研究結果如下﹐ 
1. 我們首先對影響HRP酵素活性的因素﹐如溫度､pH值､及過氧化氫濃度﹐進行了研究﹐
以此建立聚苯胺聚合反應的適合條件。發現在溫度超過37oC時﹐HRP酵素的活性隨著時間
會明顯下降﹐而於25oC或室溫條件下﹐HRP酵素的活性可以維持12小時。此外﹐HRP酵素
活性的最佳pH值範圍在4~5之間。過氧化氫作為聚苯胺聚合反應的主要氧化劑﹐當濃度超
過10mM時﹐其對HRP酵素的活性有非常明顯的影響。 
 
2. 在探討HRP酵素催化聚苯胺聚合反應時﹐我們發現HRP及過氧化氫非常快速激發聚苯胺的
聚合反應﹐其反應程度受到HRP加入量的影響。同時﹐從反應系統的顏色及沉澱物的多寡﹐
發現HRP加入量的多少會決定聚苯胺聚合產物的分子量的大小。 
 
3. 過氧化氫在不影響HRP酵素活性的前提下﹐增加其濃度對聚苯胺聚合反應並無顯著的幫
助。因此﹐未來可考慮採用滴加的方式﹐以確保HRP酵素的活性。 
 
4. 而苯胺單體的濃度對聚合反應有顯著的影響﹐基本上其濃度增加聚合產物會明顯增加﹐但
其影響受到苯胺與過氧化氫濃度比﹐HRP酵素濃度及活性的限制。過高的苯胺濃度對HRP
酵素的活性有非常明顯的影響。從SEM圖可見聚苯胺首先聚合形成2~10nm的球形顆粒﹐
然後形成較大的聚集體﹐並在反應數小時後沉澱。由分光光度儀及電化學分析可知﹐在目
前條件下聚合所得的產物均為導電性較差的氧化態﹐但通過加酸處理即可得到導電性較佳
的中間態聚苯胺。 
 
5. 加入經SDS變性處理的BSA作為聚合反應的模板﹐可以有效提高聚苯胺產物﹐改善聚苯胺
的導電性。 
 
6. 為了降低酵素的成本﹐我們也嘗試使用黃豆為原料﹐經過初步的分離步驟﹐發現同樣可以
催化聚苯胺的聚合反應﹐不過效果遠不及商業化的HRP酵素。此方法將有待進一步的改善。 
 
7. 此外﹐我們利用中空材料﹐如SBA-15﹐對酵素進行包埋。初步的實驗結果表明﹐中空材
料能有效地提高酵素的穩定性。 
 
近來﹐"綠色化學製程＂的議題已受到全世界各國相當大的重視。利用具有極強催化能力及特
殊專一性的酵素﹐在相當溫和的條件下生產導電性高分子的技術將可以改善並取代傳統化學
製程﹐ 對降低能耗及環保均有重大的貢獻。我們期待此研究結果及未來更深入的研究探討能
給化學工業帶來新的願景。

Abstract 
Polyaniline (PANI) is considered as one of the most fascinating conductive polymers in 
fabricating enzyme-based biosensors, Nevertheless, to improve both sensitivity and stability of the 
PANI modified biosensor has been and continues to be a technical challenge. In this study, we have 
electrochemically synthesized the PANI film on a platinum (Pt) electrode and then used this 
electrode to construct a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) based biosensor for the detection of hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2). The electrochemical and structural properties of electrodes were characterized 
with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform 
infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It was interestingly found that the 
PANI film synthesized in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) had provided the electrode 
with enhanced sensitivity and excellent stability. Our results suggested that the embedded BSA 
might serve as an initial template for aniline polymerization and stabilized the microstructure of the 
PANI film significantly. The constructed HRP/PANI(BSA)/Pt electrode also exhibited a fine linear 
correlation with H2O2 concentration. This approach by implanted BSA was useful for improving the 
sensitivity and stability of PANI modified biosensor.

searching for the suitable approaches to maintain the immobi-
lized enzymes on electrodes with optimum catalytic activities
and stabilities is still the main focus of current researches on
this subject.
Glutaraldehyde (GA) is a commonly used crosslinking agent
for immobilizing enzymes on electrodes (Migneault et al.,
2004). In an aqueous buffer solution with suitable pH, ionic
strength, and temperature, glutaraldehyde reacts rapidly with
amino groups of targets to generate the intramolecular or inter-
molecular covalent linkages (Hopwood, 1970). Although several
possible mechanisms have been proposed for the reactions
between glutaraldehyde and proteins, the actual mode still
remains uncertain because of the multicomponent nature of glu-
taraldehyde in an aqueous solution (Migneault et al., 2004). It
has also been reported that those lysine residues located on
the protein surface have the premier possibility to react with
glutaraldehyde through their free -amino groups (Bowes and
Cater, 1968; Habeeb, 1987; Silva et al., 2004). However, the
PANI film possesses substantial secondary amines and tertiary
imines, which greatly reduce its reactivity towards free aldehyde

for electropolymerization leaded the thicker PANI
ncreased cathodic current and sensitivity. However,
response decreased with six sweep cycles (curve (c)
in which further increasing the thickness of the PANI
s resulted in the elevated mass and electron transfer
. Moreover, the thicker PANI film had a tendency to
