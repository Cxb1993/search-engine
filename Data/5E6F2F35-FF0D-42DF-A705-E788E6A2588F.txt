Abstract
The second phase of SWAN project deals with the autopilot control refinements. The goal of
this phase is to design a longitudinal controller and to implement the controller on a UAV system.
Combined with lateral autopilot, UAV autonomous flight is achieved.
Due to lack of engine model, a series of experiments were conducted to obtain the thrust and
engine RPM under different free-stream velocities and throttle areas. The experimental data was
analyzed to obtain a nonlinear model with the engine time delay. Besides, system parameters
identification methods were used to obtain the engine linear model for PID controller design.
The complete longitudinal controller consists of 2 parts: those are the altitude autopilot and
the velocity autopilot and both use 2-loop feedback structure. The outer loop of altitude autopilot
converts altitude error into desired pitch angle and feeds it into the inner loop. The inner loop
converts pitch angle error into desired elevator deflection and sends commands to servos. The
outer loop of velocity controller converts velocity error to desired engine RPM and feeds desired
engine RPM into the inner loop. The inner loop controls RPM via throttle area.
After a series of flight test validations, the longitudinal controller holds velocity and altitude
at desired values successfully.

1. Introduction
This report presents the development of the longitudinal flight controller system for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system with Surveillance, Watch, Autonomous Flight and
Navigation (SWAN) capability for beyond-visual-range (BVR) flight [1]. The Remotely Piloted
Vehicle and Micro-Satellite Research Laboratory (RMRL) of the Institute of Aeronautics &
Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University has been working on UAV development for over
20 years [2]. In recent years, research has been conducted on onboard computers and ground
control stations [3], optical sensing systems [4], and attitude measurement systems [5]. The
RMRL already demonstrated the ability to operate a UAV in the cross-sea flight on July 30, 2005
in Pingtung, south of Taiwan. This experiment successfully proves the stability and controllability
of SWAN UAV [1].
the same amount of throttle area increment, the thrust increment is much smaller as velocity
increases.
To model the engine thrust under diferent circumstances, “advanced ratio” is introduced. The 
dimensionless “advanced ratio”, J, is defined as: 
v
J
nD

Where “v” is the free-stream velocity in meters per second, “n” is propeler rotating speed in 
RPS (revolutions per second), “D” is the diameter of propeler in meters. The airplane advances 
v/n after propeller rotates one revolution, thus the physical meaning of advanced ratio is the ratio
of the distance of the airplane “advances” to the propeler diameter. 
The thrust of engine can be characterized as the “thrust coeficient”. For a specific propeler, a 
specific engine, and a fixed advanced ratio, the thrust coeficient is a constant. The “thrust
coeficient” is defined as 
2 4
T
Ct
n D

Where “ρ” is air density, “T” is thrust of engine. Thrust Coeficient is a combination factor 
that combines the design of the propeller, the Advance Ratio J, and the Reynolds number of the
advancing blade. After some experiments, the thrust coefficient for different advanced ratio of
SWAN is obtained and is shown in Figure 4. The resultant engine thrust model is shown in Figure
5. The engine RPM and free-stream velocity is the model inputs and is converted to advanced
ratio, then find the corresponding thrust coefficient, finally the thrust can be obtained.
2.3 Discrete Longitudinal Equation of Motion
The aerodynamic coefficients of SWAN are estimated according to the method mentioned in
Ref. [9]. Assume that SWAN flies at the speed of 80 kilometer per hour at sea level, according to
the size of SWAN and aerodynamic coefficient, the reference flight conditions are derived and
shown in Table 1, and longitudinal derivatives are shown in Table 2. Combined with specification
of SWAN, the longitudinal EOMs of SWAN can be written as

mT / means the thrust difference compared with trim thrust and divided by the mass of
the airplane. And the sampling rate of onboard computer (OBC) is 10Hz. The continuous

At cruise condition, thrust equals to drag. The drag coefficient of SWAN in cruise is 0.04104,
thus the drag in cruise is:

Then
whose excess power is low, in accelerating, the increase of pitch angle is slower and can be
compensated by the pitch angle controller, and thus the climb phenomenon is not clear. Therefore
for low thrust-to-weight ratio aircraft, control altitude via elevator and control velocity via throttle
is a better way. SWAN, whose sea-level thrust-to-weight ratio is only 0.61, is a low
thrust-to-weight ratio UAV, and it is better to control altitude via throttle and control altitude via
elevator.
Throttle regulates fuel / air ratio and controls power output of engine. At a given altitude, the
higher the RPM the higher the power output of the engine. For aircraft with a fixed pitch
propeller, the throttle controls the engine RPM. The proposed velocity controller block diagram is
shown in Figure 11. The outer-loop calculates differences between desired airspeed and current
airspeed, and sends this value into PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller, then
controller calculates desired RPM difference, plus trim RPM, pass the RPM saturation limit, and
then send desired RPM into inner loop. The inner loop calculates the difference between desired
RPM and current RPM then sends this information into PID controller, controller calculates
desired throttle, pass through throttle saturation limit then send throttle command to the servo.
The reciprocating engine is a slow plant, therefore the speed variation is very slow after throttle
position changed, with the RPM-control inner loop, and the engine power output can be
monitored to have better control quality.
3.2 Velocity Control Design and Simulation
The inner-loop is a feedback control that utilizes throttle to control engine RPM, shown in
Figure 12. The resultant controller is:

PI controller is used and Kp and Ki are assigned to be 0.02 and 0.03 respectively in this
research. The selection of Kp is based on physical relation, in other words, increase 20 % throttle
to increase 1000 RPM. Since the RPM readings from tachometer are noisy, no Kd term is used to
avoid amplifying noise. The resultant root locus is shown in Figure 13, and inner-loop step
response is shown in Figure 14. The settling time of RPM (95%) is 1.6 seconds, only a little
oscillation occurs. The system response is satisfactory.
The outer-loop also uses a PI controller whose Kp=30 and Ki=15. The gain values are
selected through trial and error based on the nonlinear simulation results. The complete two-loop
feedback control block diagram is presented in Figure 15 and the resultant controller is:
31.5( 0.9524)

The velocity step response simulation is shown in Figure 16. The settling time of velocity
(95%) is 55 seconds, and some oscillation is observed, but it is acceptable. Pitch angle changes
from 0 to -1.4 degree, the altitude change is only 2.5 meters. The resultant controller can meet the
requirements.
4. Flight test validation
4.1 Engine RPM control
To validate inner-loop RPM controller, a flight test took place on June 22, 2006. The
experimental processes included the pilot operations to control the UAV in low speed at a level
flight, and then engaged the autopilot in the mode of heading control, altitude control, and RPM
control. The trims of the control surfaces are: T_thr=80%, t_ele=3 degrees, t_ail=-0.5 degree,
t_rud=0 degree. Autopilot settings are: the desired altitude is 250 meters, the desired heading is 0
(north), and the desired RPM is 8000 RPM. The flight data is shown in Figure 16 and 17. The
flight test results indicated that the RPM controller can maintain the engine RPM at desired
values. The settling time is 8.5 seconds (initially UAV is climbing), and oscillation in steady state
is found but it is mainly due to the tachometer noises.
