Abstract 
 
When dealing with vagueness, there are situations 
when there is insufficient information available, 
making it impossible to satisfactorily evaluate 
membership. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory is 
more suitable than fuzzy sets to deal with such 
problem. In 1996, Atanassov proposed the mapping 
from Intuitionistic fuzzy sets to fuzzy sets. However, 
there are deficiencies in this mapping. In this study, 
the proposed switch method is defined and discussed 
to determine the relationship between type-2 fuzzy 
sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and the switching 
results are applied to show the usefulness of the 
proposed method in medical diagnosis reasoning. 
Furthermore, the switching algorithm is applied in 
our newly WSN motion sensor system, which is 
equipped with Wiimote motion sensor. Accordingly, 
our system can predict the user’s motion and location 
with the switching type-2 inference system 
employed.

1. Introduction 
 
The theory of fuzzy sets (FSs), proposed by 
Zadeh (1965) [1], is being successful applied in 
various fields. In 1996, Atanassov proposed the 
mapping association from Intuitionistic fuzzy sets 
(IFSs) to FSs [2]. Although IFSs can be conclude as 
being an extension of FSs, there are deficiencies in 
this mapping. They are difficult to comprehend and 
lack axiom definition. In addition, when considering 
certain variations of FSs such Sugeno’s or Yager’s 
[4][5], the mapping does not satisfy the elemental 
intuitionism condition given by Atanassov.  
Because the standard FSs are not able to directly 
model uncertainties, IFSs are not identical to the FSs 
and have the earlier mentioned deficiencies. On the 
other hand, type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs) are very 
appropriate for our purpose [3]. The advantage of 
T2FSs is the fact that their membership functions 
themselves are fuzzy. Thus, in this study, the author 
defines and provides the mutual switch between IFSs 
and T2FSs, as well as the medical diagnosis with 
imperfect facts involving the type-2 similarity and 
our switching method. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. sections 2 and 3 briefly review essential 
concepts of T2FSs and IFSs. Section 4 defines and 
proves the proposed mutual-switch between two sets. 
Section 5 presents an empirical example of medical 
diagnosis to illustrate the utility of the proposed 
switch. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 
 
2. Basic Definitions of Type-2 Fuzzy Sets 
 
A T2FS is characterized by a fuzzy membership. 
The distinction between a T2FS and a FS is that the 
membership value for a T2FS is a fuzzy set in [0,1], 
whereas the membership grade of a standard FS is a 
crisp value in [0,1]. To clarify statement, the FS ‘tall’

(2) 
 
 
where ఈ݂: ܫܨܵሺܺሻ ՜ ܨܵሺܺሻ . This operator ఈ݂ 
coincides with the operator ܦఈ  given in [2]. 
However, the deficiencies of above equation are as 
follows. 
I. The equation only considers the membership 
degree and omits the non-membership degree. 
II. This operator cannot handle the reverse switch 
from FS to IFS. 
III. Considering the complement of FS such as 
Sugeno’s or Yager’s, the sum of membership and 
non-membership from one, the result derived from (2) 
is a negative number, and thus not satisfy the 
elemental intuitionism condition given by Atanassov 
[2]. 
 
Besides, for each element x, a T2FS can model 
hesitation and more uncertainties by using the 
additional degrees. For instance, the polarizing 
concepts, i.e., more/less, optimistic/pessimistic, 
membership/non-membership can be inferred by the 
secondary grades. That is, the secondary grades are 
defined to measure the magnitudes, which allow us to 
weight the degree of intuitionism of an IFS. Thus, to 
conquer the above deficiencies, the mutual switch 
between T2FS and IFS is introduced as follows. 
Accordingly, the mapping from ܫܨܵሺܺሻ  to 
ܨܵଶሺܺሻ is defined as follows, 
 
Definition 4.1. Let ܣሙ א ܫܨܵሺܺሻ define as: 
 
ܣሙ ൌ ∑ ሾݔ௜,௡௜ୀଵ ߤ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻ, ݒ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻሿ ,   (3) 
 
where ݔ௜ א ܺ. Then, the mapping from ܫܨܵሺܺሻ to ܨܵଶሺܺሻ is defined as 
 
ܣሚ ൌ ∑ ሾ1/ሺߤ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻ ൅ ݌ߨ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻሻ ൅ 0/ሺ1 െ௡௜ୀଵݒ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻ ൅ ݌ߨ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻሻሿ /ݔ௜,    (4) 
 
The secondary grade in (4) represents the 
indeterminacy index of the 
membership/non-membership degree, which models 
the unhesitancy of deciding degree to which an object 
satisfies a particular property. That is, 1/0 in 
secondary grades means the certainty/uncertainty on 
membership/non-membership herein. Besides, 
according to P1 (properties of IFSs), the definition of 
non-membership degree of an element x in IFS is 
ݒ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻ ൒ ݒ஻ෘ ሺݔ௜ሻ ֞ ܣሙ ൑ ܤෘ . This notion conflicts 
with the natural generalization of a standard fuzzy set 
of Zadeh’s containment statement, ݒ஺ෘሺݔ௜ሻ ൑
ݒ஻ෘ ሺݔ௜ሻ ֞ ܣሙ ൑ ܤෘ  [1]. Thus, the non-membership 
value in (7) is obtained by subtracting the ݒ஻ෘ ሺݔ௜ሻ 
from one. 
 
Furthermore, it is known that if  is a fuzzy set 
on a referential ܺ and ܿ: ሾ0,1ሿ ՜ ሾ0,1ሿ is a fuzzy 
complement, the set 
 
ܣ ൌ ∑ ሾݔ௜,௡௜ୀଵ ߤ஺ሺݔ௜ሻ, ܿሺߤ஺ሺݔ௜ሻሻሿ (5) 
 
is treated as an IFS [10]. However, according to our 
previous statement, non-membership value is not a 
natural generalization of the standard FS. Besides, if 
we take Sugeno’s negation [4]  
 
ఒܿሺݔሻ ൌ 1 െ ݔ1 ൅ ߣݔ , ݓ݅ݐ݄ െ 1 ൏ ߣ ൏ 0, 
 
or Yager’s negation [5] 
 
ఒܿሺݔሻ ൌ ሺ1 െ ݔఠሻଵ/ఠ, ݓ݅ݐ݄ 1 ൏ ߱,  
 
as a fuzzy complement, then (5) is not an IFS, 
because ߤ஺ሺݔ௜ሻ ൅  ܿሺߤ஺ሺݔ௜ሻሻ ൐ 1  and therefore ߨ஺ሺݔ௜ሻ ൏ 0. Hence, in our study, for the purpose of 
clarifying the relationship between T2FS and IFS, the 
reverse mapping from ܨܵଶሺܺሻ to ܫܨܵሺܺሻ is defined 
as follows, 
 
Definition 4.2. Let ܣሚ א ܨܵଶሺܺሻ define as, 
 
ܣሚ ൌ ∑ ሾ1/ߤଵሺݔ௜ሻ ൅ 0/ߤଶሺݔ௜ሻሿ௡௜ୀଵ /ݔ௜,  (6)

5. Medical Diagnosis for Application 
 
A medical knowledge base is focus on how to 
make a proper diagnosis D for a patient T with given 
values of symptoms S. Thus, in this section, the 
technique for handling medical diagnostic problems 
based on type-2 similarity is presented. In a given 
pathology, suppose that S is a set of symptoms, D is a 
set of diagnoses, and T is a set of patients. Analogous 
to De’s notation of “Intuitionistic Medical 
 -5- 
 
identified as services. These services may be 
integrated according to what the user behaves under 
the specific context.  
About the motion sensor, the wiimote controller 
contains 3-axis accelerometers (please review Fig. 1), 
in arbitrary units, the instantaneous force imparted on 
the controller by the player holding it [17]. A rigid 
body in 3D space, has 6 degrees of freedom: 3 linear 
translation directions (X, Y, Z) and 3 rotation angles 
(pitch, roll, yaw). If the sensor response to 
acceleration is roughly linear, then calibrating the 
wiimote controller is a three step procedure: (a). 
horizontal with the button facing up, (b). IR sensor 
down on the table, so the expansion port is facing up, 
(c). lying on its side, so the left side is facing up. 
Accordingly, following the 3 steps of calibration 
procedure, the motion data can be sensed and 
transmitted by the ZigBee network.  
Accordingly, the prototype framework of 
ubiquitous sensing system is shown in Fig. 2. The 
whole system is divided into three subsystems, and 
they are discussed as follows, 
Motion analysis subsystem. The motion analysis 
subsystem consists of event acquisition, context 
inference, and action request modules. An event 
acquisition module reads user gesture data from a 
variety of network connected nodes such as ZigBee 
badges. After receiving a series of data, a context 
inference module is used to identify gesture-like 
command in the motion data requires the fuzzy 
pattern inference. Besides, an action request module 
is used to train the subsystem to recognize different 
motions by physically moving the controller. 
Knowledge based subsystem. According to the 
obtained gesture-like command, this subsystem 
evaluates the user desire with his command and his 
position. The recognizing algorithm is based on the 
proposed switching type-2 inference system. The 
series user’s motion data can be encoded as fuzzy 
data sets. Thus, classify the best matching 
gesture-like command in the service base, plus the 
consideration with the user location, the user desire is 
obtained and passes to the following subsystem. 
Service triggered subsystem. After the user’s 
historical data being collected, the WSN tag devices 
are architected to exchange messages to effect control 
the home sensor devices, such as turning a lamp on or 
off, sending a light sensor measurement to a lighting 
controller, or sending an alert message if an 
occupancy sensor detect movement, and etc. Hence, 
in this subsystem, the home sensor services are 
established. 
 
7. CONCLUSIONS  
 
T2FSs are significant for imprecise and imperfect 
information handling. However, their extensive 
applications are getting less attention. In our project, 
a mutual switch between T2FSs and IFSs is defined 
and the medical diagnosis is generalized by the 
switching and reasoning with type-2 similarity. As a 
consequence, easy comprehension and axiom 
definition are provided during the switch. In addition, 
our method makes it possible to extend the usage of 
T2FSs and renews the relationship between T2FSs 
and IFSs. 
 On the other hands, the development of a 
ubiquitous sensing system that applied our switching 
method, the motion sensor and WSN network 
technologies. Our proposed system is tried not to 
increase the burden of users, on the contrary, user 
habits and gesture-like commands are easily 
generated and adopted with the remote sensor 
controller, and the sensor data are controlled and 
transmitted via the WSN ZigBee network. That is, 
every user not only can physically integrate into the 
home sensor environment and mobile life, but also 
can spontaneously interoperate in any changing 
environment.
