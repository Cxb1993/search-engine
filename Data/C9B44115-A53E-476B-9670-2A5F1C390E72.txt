Abstract 
This project is the first-year project of a 
two-year research plan. The goal was to develop 
a robot who can smoothly ride a regular bicycle 
with training wheels. Most of the previous re-
search focused on autonomous bicycles, so 
people may ask: what is the value of developing 
a robot who can ride a bicycle? At least, it can 
help us understand how people learn to ride bi-
cycles. With this knowledge we may teach those 
people who cannot ride bicycles more effective-
ly and efficiently.  
For the mechanism of the robot, the thigh, 
the shank, and the crank of the bicycle are com-
posed of a four-bar linkage, which is used to 
pedal the bicycle. The optimal lengths were de-
rived for the thigh and the shank of the robot. 
We also used ratchet wheels to uncouple the 
linkages of the left and right legs. For the con-
trol of the robot, we used Compact RIO as the 
controller and its FPGA to directly control the 
motors. The test results showed that the robot 
can smoothly ride a regular bicycle with training 
wheels on a flat surface, and it can successfully 
control the speed of the bicycle.

Fig. 2. Four methods of maintaining balance. 
 
 Aydemir and Iba [2] studied the problem of a robot riding 
on a bicycle. They used the small humanoid robot HOAP-2 
made by Fujitsu Automation to ride a kick-bike, a bicycle 
without pedals or crank arms. They showed balance of the 
bicycle could be maintained by controlling the rotation of the 
handlebar. However, the bicycle was moved forward by 
human’s push, not by the robot’s legs.  
 The following discussion will be on autonomous bicycles, 
which are closely related to our research with the exception 
that there is no robot’s leg movement involved. Beznos et al. 
[3] installed two gyroscopes on a bicycle for maintaining 
balance. Experimental results showed that the design could 
not keep the bicycle moving with a constant steering angle. 
One possible reason was that the feedback control did not 
include the centrifugal force and the torque due to the 
changing velocity and the steering angle. Yamakita et al. [4] 
used an inverted pendulum to keep balance of a bicycle. The 
inverted pendulum needed to rotate nearly 90? to achieve it. 
When the inverted pendulum moved to one side, the bicycle 
tilted to the other side. The tilt angle seemed too large to keep 
the bicycle to move in a straight line.  
Many other researchers, such as Sooraksa et al. [5-7], 
Tanaka et al. [8], Yi et al. [9], Guo et al. [10, 11], Ham et al. 
[12], used the method of steering control to keep the bicycles 
in balance. At low speed, the bicycles may jiggle. Therefore, 
some researchers used two or more methods to control the 
balance of bicycles. 
Getz et al. [13] controlled the handlebar and the rear-wheel 
torque of an autonomous bicycle. The simulation results 
showed that it was feasible. Iuchi et al. [14] employed two PD 
(proportional-differential) controller to control the handlebar 
and the position of the center of gravity of a bicycle. The 
experimental results showed that by controlling both can make 
the bicycle more stable than by controlling the handlebar only. 
Lee et al. [15] controlled the handlebar, the center of gravity 
and the rear-wheel torque on the simplified numerical model 
of a bicycle. The simulation showed that the method was 
promising. However, no experiment was performed to verify 
that. The approaches that the mentioned researchers 
previously used were summarized in the following table.

From the previous discussion, it can be understood that 
there are still many issues needed to be resolved for a 
bicycle-riding robot, such as how to design a robot who can 
ride a regular bicycle, how to maintain stability at low or zero 
speed without using gyroscopes, etc. It can help people to 
understand more about riding bicycles by solving the 
problems. Therefore, the objective of this research was to 
build a bicycle-riding robot. By using its legs, the robot can 
ride a regular bicycle, not a custom-made bicycle without a 
ratchet.  Besides, the robot will not use a gyroscope to 
maintain balance. It will use the control of the center of gravity 
to achieve the balance, so its behavior will be more like a real 
human’s. The following sections will be discussing the 
mechanism of the robot, the control of the robot, and the 
experimental results obtained so far in sequence. 
II. MECHANISM 
  The CAD model of the bicycle-riding robot that we are 
developing is shown in Fig. 3. The robot consists of a body, 
two hands, and two legs. They were made of aluminum and 
engineering plastics. Two motors were installed first for 
driving the left leg and controlling the center of gravity, 
respectively. The bicycle that the robot rides is a 12-inch 
bicycle (model number KJ-121, produced by Giant bicycle, 
Inc.), and no major change was made on this bicycle. The 
height of the robot is about 1000 mm and the weight is about 
10 kg. The robot can be fixed at the seat of the bicycle. The 
completed bicycle-riding robot is shown in Fig. 4. The box on 
the back of the robot is its controller. Because this is a 
preliminary development of the bicycle-riding robot, the 
bicycle will have the training wheels attached all the time.   
 
 
 
 
Fig. 8. The LabVIEW program for generating PWM and direction signals. 
 
The encoders are used for sensing the motors’ angular 
positions, and we need to decode the signals from the 
encoders to understand the position. Fig. 9 shows the 
LabVIEW program that can achieve this. The signals of 
channnels A and B are input to the program. By comparing 
current signals and previous signals, we can realize the 
rotation angle and direction. 
 
Fig. 9. The LabVIEW program for decoding the signals from the encoders. 
 
 We also need to understand the roll altitude and the roll 
rate of the bicycle-riding robot. Since the tile sensor  and the 
gyroscope we use are analog sensors, we can obtain the 
signals via CompactRIO’s analog input module and find the 
corresponding angular information by linear interpolation. Fig. 
10 shows the program that we use to obtain the analog signals 
from the sensors.

sensors. 
 
For the robot to control the balance of the bicycle by using 
classical control theory, we need to describe the dynamical 
behavior of the bicycle by using its equation of motion. To 
obtain a complete equation of motion of a bicycle is involved 
so we need to simplify the problem by assuming that all the 
components of the bicycle and robot are rigid bodies, and the 
degrees of freedom of the chain wheels, the pedals, and the 
legs will not be considered when forming the equation of 
motion. One more assumption is that there is no slippery 
between the tires and the ground. The key geometrical 
parameters of the bicycle are shown in Fig. 11.

V. CONCLUSIVE REMARKS 
In this research, a bicycle-riding robot was developed.  The 
bicycle that the robot rides is a regular bicycle, and the robot 
pedals the bicycle with a motor installed on its left hip. 
Because the mechanism, which consists of the thigh, shank, 
and the crank arm, is a roller-crank four-bar linkage and we 
drive it from the roller (thigh), the dead-point problem is 
inevitable and needs to be resolved. The way we used to solve 
the problem was to take advantage of the angular momentum 
of the crank to bring the linkage to pass the dead points. 
Experimental results showed that when the timing and speed 
were set properly, the robot could pedal its bicycle and move 
forward continuously by using only one motor. However, 
when the timing or speed was not set right, or the conditions of 
the bicycle changed, such as the joint condition or the tension 
of the chain, the robot could stop or pedal its bicycle in the 
wrong direction. Therefore, it is feasible to use only one motor 
for a robot to ride a regular bicycle, but the control of the 
motion of the robot’s leg needs to be very precise, and the 
factors that will change the conditions of the robot and the 
bicycle need to be controlled tightly. Further research is 
continuing to find a more robust method to drive the robot’s 
legs.

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to study and improve the 3D digitizer based on grinding 
technique that was developed previously. For the 3D digitizer, using the threshold method is 
better compared to the common edge detectors to find the edges on the cross-sectional images 
of an object. It was shown that the grinding technique used in the 3D digitizer generates better 
surface condition than the milling technique commonly used in other 3D digitizers, and this 
can be beneficial to the image processing. To increase the overall image resolution, an image-
merging method was proposed by putting a fiducial on top of the object to allow us to merge 
partial images into a full image. One of the key factors for the success of using the threshold 
method is the contrast between the object and the background, and we developed a program 
with a controllable power supply to automatically adjust the illumination based on the 
histograms of the images to obtain the largest contrast. Finally, we performed an experiment 
by using the Taguchi’s method and found out that the grinding depth is the most significant 
factor that can be controlled on the 3D digitizer for burr length reduction.

1. Introduction 
One of the most needed information in current manufacturing industry is the geometry of 
a product, especially the inner geometry which cannot be observed directly from outside. 
How to obtain the geometry of an object is one of the main subjects of reverse engineering 
(RE). The common approaches are tactile methods, optical methods, and layered methods.  
The tactile methods and the optical methods cannot be applied to obtain the inner 
structure of an object. The only feasible approaches for this situation are the layered method, 
which includes industrial computer tomography (ICT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and a 3D digitizer. The high costs and low resolution (0.5 mm or more) of both CT and MRI 
result in the limited use in industry. On the contrary, a 3D digitizer can achieve high 
resolution with a relatively low cost. Therefore, a 3D digitizer is an indispensable tool for the 
applications of precisely obtaining the inner structure of an object. The work flow of a 3D 
digitizer is to remove the material of an object layer by layer and capture the image of the 
cross section of each layer. Then all the images are stacked up in a computer to reconstruct 
the 3D CAD model.  
A 3D digitizer has been studied by a few companies and research institutes. One of the 
companies that produce commercial 3D digitizers is CGI (USA) [1]. CGI uses CNC milling 
machines to remove the materials and CCD cameras to capture images. Little information is 
open to the public on CGI’s 3D digitizers so the technical details are mostly unknown. Yang 
et al. [2] developed a 3D digitizer by using a 600 DPI optical scanner to capture images. For 
an optical scanner, the actual length for a pixel is fixed. The length that a pixel represents for 
a 600 DPI scanner is about 0.04 mm, which may not be enough for small objects. Chang et al. 
[3] also developed a 3D digitizer, which consists of a milling machine with a side cutter and a 
2-215 
center of the object. Then we obtained two images with 1024768 resolution. One covered 
from the left side of the object to at least the full fiducial as shown in Fig. 2(a), and the other 
covered from the full fiducial to the right side of the object as shown in Fig. 2(b). Finally we 
can merge the two images together by putting the fiducials of the two images at the identical 
location and remove the overlapped portion. The final result is shown in Fig. 2(c), whose 
resolution is 1360768, a 33% increase in the resolution.

3. Automatic light intensity adjustment 
A good image for a 3D digitizer is the one with large contrast so that we can easily 
separate the object from the background (epoxy). Light intensity is a key factor for obtaining 
the good image. If the light intensity is too low or too high, then the image will be too dark or 
too bright, which will make it difficult to accurately obtain the edges of the cross sections of 
the object. The histogram of a grey-level image with weak light intensity is shown in Fig. 
3(a). From the figure it can be seen that the peak of the background is very close to that of the 
object. Therefore, wherever we put the threshold between the peaks, a substantial error will be 
inevitable. To get the maximum contrast, an automatic light intensity program with a 
controllable power supply was developed. The controllable power supply receives digital 
signals from the program and converts them to the corresponding current to drive the 
lightening device (LEDs) in the 3D digitizer. The schematic of the power supply is shown in 
Fig. 4(a) and the circuit board is shown in Fig. 4(b). The automatic light intensity adjustment 
works as follows. An image with initial light intensity is captured, and the associated 
histogram of the image is created. Repeat this previous step by continuously increasing the 
light intensity and creating the histograms. When one of the peaks in the histograms reaches 
the maximum value (255), the program stops. Then the light intensity when the separation of 
the two peaks is the largest as shown in Fig. 3 (b) will be set as the light intensity for 
capturing the images of the cross sections. By comparing Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) it can be 
understood that the automatic light intensity adjustment device can eliminate the light
