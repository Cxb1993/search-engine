polythiophenes,5 polypyrroles),6 as well as inorganic systems based on transition 
metal oxides (e.g., WO3)7 have been described. Conducting or conjugated polymers 
have been found to be more promising as electrochromic materials because of their 
better stability, faster switching speeds, and easy processing compared to the 
inorganic electrochromic materials, but the most exciting properties are multiple 
colors with the same material while switching between their different redox states,8 
and fine-tuning of the color transition through chemical structure modification of the 
conjugated backbone.9,10 Considerable effort in the Reynolds group has been made on 
the understanding and the tailoring of electrochromic properties in conducting 
polymers such as poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene)s5 and 
poly(3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole)s6 and their derivatives. 
Triarylamine derivatives are well known for photo- and electroactive properties that 
find optoelectronic applications as photoconductors, hole-transporters, and 
light-emitters.11 Triarylamines can be easily oxidized to form stable radical cations, 
and the oxidation process is always associated with a noticeable change of coloration. 
Thus, many triarylamine-based electrochromic polymers have been reported in 
literature.12 In recent years, we have developed a number of high-performance 
polymers (e.g., aromatic polyamides and polyimides) carrying the triphenylamine 
(TPA) unit as an electrochromic functional moiety.13 Our strategy was to synthesize 
the TPA-containing monomers such as diamines and dicarboxylic acids that were then 
reacted with the corresponding comonomers through conventional polycondensation 
techniques. The obtained polymers possessed characteristically high molecular 
weights and high thermal stability. Because of the incorporation of packing-disruptive, 
propeller-shaped TPA units along the polymer backbone, most of these polymers 
exhibited good solubility in polar organic solvents. They may form uniform, 
transparent amorphous thin films by solution casting and spin-coating methods. This

hydrazine monohydrate (TCI) were used without further purification. 
N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) (Tedia), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Tedia), 
pyridine (Py) (Wako) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (Tedia) were dried over 
calcium hydride for 24 h, distilled under reduced pressure, and stored over 4 Å 
molecular sieves in a sealed bottle. The commercially available aromatic dicarboxylic 
acids such as terephthalic acid (5a) (Wako), isophthalic acid (5b) (Wako), 
4,4’-biphenydicarboxylic acid (5c) (TCI), 4,4’-dicarboxydiphenyl ether (5d) (TCI),

2,2-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane (5f) (TCI), 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic 
acid (5g) (Wako), 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (5h) (TCI) were used as received. 
Commercially obtained calcium chloride was dried under vacuum at 150 oC for 6 h 
prior to use. Commercially available aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydrides such as 
pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA; 8a; Aldrich) and 
3,3’,4,4’-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA; 8c; Aldrich) were 
purified by recrystallization from acetic anhydride. 3,3’,4,4’-Biphenyltetracarboxylic 
dianhydride (BPDA; 8b; Oxychem), 4,4’-oxydiphthalic dianhydride (ODPA; 8d; 
Oxychem),  3,3’,4,4’-diphenylsulfonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (DSDA; 8e; New 
Japan Chemical Co.), and 2,2-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane 
dianhydride (6FDA; 8f; Hoechst Celanese) were heated at 250 oC in vacuo for 3 h 
before use. Commercially obtained anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2) was dried 
under vacuum at 180 oC for 8 h. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) (TCI) was 
recrystallized twice by ethyl acetate under nitrogen atmosphere and then dried in 
vacuo prior to use. All other reagents were used as received from commercial sources.

Preparation of Polyamides by Direct Polycondensation via the Phosphorylation 
Reaction 
The synthesis of polyamide 6d was used as an example to illustrate the general 
synthetic route used to produce the polyamides. A mixture of 0.510 g (1.2 mmol) of 
diamine, 4-(1-adamantoxy)-4’,4”-diaminotriphenylamine (4), 0.310 g (1.2 mmol) of 
4,4’-oxydibenzoic acid (5d), 0.2 g of dried calcium chloride, 1.3 mL of triphenyl 
phosphite (TPP), 0.3 mL of pyridine, and 2.0 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) 
was heated with stirring at 120 oC for 3 h. The obtained polymer solution was poured 
slowly into 300 mL of stirred methanol giving rise to a stringy, fiberlike precipitate 
that was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol, and 
dried under vacuum at 100 oC. Reprecipitations of the polymer by 
N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc)/methanol were carried out twice for further 
purification. The inherent viscosity of the obtained polyamide 6d was 0.61 dL/g, 
measured at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL in DMAc at 30 oC. 
 
Preparation of Polyimides by Two-step Method via Thermal and Chemical 
Imidization Reaction 
 10
Preparation of the Polyamide Films 
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving about 0.7 g of the polyamides sample 
in 12 mL of DMAc. The homogeneous solution was poured into a 12-cm glass Petri 
dish, which was placed in a 90 oC oven for 5 h to remove most of the solvent; then the 
semidried film was further dried in vacuo at 180 oC for 8 h. The obtained films were 
about 80-100 μm in thickness and were used for X-ray diffraction measurements, 
solubility tests, and thermal analyses. 
 
Measurements 
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental 
analyses were run in a Heraeus VarioEL-III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H and 13C 
NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE-500 FT-NMR system and 
referenced to the DMSO-d6 signal, and peak multiplicity was reported as follows: s, 
singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet. The inherent viscosities were determined at 
0.5 g/dL concentration using a Cannon-Fenske or Ubbelohde viscometers at 30 oC. 
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were performed at room 
temperature (ca. 25 oC) on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 20 
mA), using graphite-monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA) was conducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were carried out 
on approximately 3-5 mg film samples heated in flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate = 
20 cm3/min) at a heating rate of 20 oC/min. DSC analyses were performed on a 
PerkinElmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of 20 oC/min in flowing nitrogen (20 
cm3/min). Thermomechanical analysis (TMA) was conducted with a PerkinElmer 
TMA 7 instrument. The TMA experiments were conducted from 50 to 350 oC at a 
scan rate of 10 oC/min with a penetration probe 1.0 mm in diameter under an applied 
constant load of 10 mN. Softening temperatures (Ts) were taken as the onset

monomer 4. Figure 1 shows the FT-IR spectra of the synthesized the starting material 
and adamantoxy-based nitro or amine intermediates and targeted diamine 4. After 
nucleophile substitution from 1-admantanol and para-fluoronitrobenzene by using 
sodium hydride as strong base, the characteristic absorption of hydroxy group (broad 
band around 3286 cm-1) disappeared and the nitro groups of compound 1 showed two 
characteristic bands at around 1585 and 1342 cm-1 (-NO2 asymmetric and symmetric 
stretching). After reduction, the characteristic absorptions of the nitro group 
disappeared and the primary amino group showed the pair typical N-H stretching 
absorptions in 3469 and 3353 cm-1. Following the double N-arylation reactions of 2 
and presently reduction, the characteristic absorptions of the nitro group disappeared 
and the primary amino group showed the pair absorptions in 3456 and 3369 cm-1. The 
characteristic absorptions of adamantane also showed the strong C-H stretching of 
methylene and methine group around 2800-3000 cm-1. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra 
of the diamine monomer 4 were illustrated in Figure 2 and agree well with the 
proposed molecular structure. 
 
Polymer synthesis 
According to the phosphorylation technique first described by Yamazaki and 
coworkers,25 a series of novel polyamides 6a-6h carrying bulky admantane ether units 
were synthesized from the diamine, 4-(1-adamantoxy)-4’,4”-diaminotriphenylamine, 
and various dicarboxylic acids as shown in Scheme 2. The polymerization was carried 
out via solution polycondensation using triphenyl phosphite and pyridine as 
condensing agents. The polymerization proceeded homogeneously throughout the 
reaction and afforded clear, highly viscous polymer solutions. All the polymers 
precipitated in a tough fiberlike form when slowly pouring the resulting polymer

Polymer Properties 
General Characterization 
As mentioned previously, all the polymers could afford flexible, transparent, and 
tough films. The WAXD studies of the polyamides and polyimides indicated that all 
the polymers were essentially amorphous. The amorphous properties can be attributed 
to the incorporation of bulky, noncoplanar and three-dimensional propeller-shaped 
triphenylamine moiety along the polymer backbone and rigid diamond-shaped 
adamantane ether pendent group as polymer side chain. 
The solubility behavior of polyamides 6a-h and polyimides 8a-8f were investigated 
qualitatively, and also listed in Table 1 and 2, respectively. Except for the polyimides 
derived from more rigid dianhydrides such as 8a-8b, the other polyimides and all 
polyamides exhibited good solubility in amide-type solvents such as NMP, DMAc, 
DMF at room temperature or upon heating at 70 oC. In general, these polymers 
revealed an enhanced solubility as compared with conventional aromatic polyamides 
and polyimides. This can be attributed in part to the incorporation of bulky, 
three-dimensional 4-(1-adamantoxy)triphenylamino groups, which retard dense chain 
packing and lead to a decreased chain-chain interaction. Therefore, the good solubility 
makes these polymers potential candidates for practical applications in spin-coating 
and inkjet-printing techniques to afford high performance thin films for optoelectronic 
devices. 
 
Thermal properties 
For the creation of useful devices based on organic light-emitting, 
charge-transporting or multifunctional materials, long-term durability and 
high-quality amorphous glassy materials are employed. The thermal properties of 
these polyamides were investigated by TGA, DSC, and TMA. All the thermal 
 16
trace. The Ts values measured by TMA are also listed in Table 3. As can be seen, in all 
cases, the Ts values of the polyamides obtained by TMA are lower than the Tg values 
measured by the DSC experiments. These differences may be attributed to the 
different heating story of the samples and the distinct nature of these two testing 
methods. 
The thermal behavior data of polyimides 6a-6f together with their referenced 
analogs (6a’-6f’) are also included in Table 4. The Tg values of the 6a-6f series 
polyimides measured by DSC were recorded in the range 300-311 oC. The decreasing 
order of Tg generally correlated with that of chain flexibility. For example, the 
polyimide 8d from ODPA showed the lowest Tg (300 oC) because of the presence of 
flexible ether linkage between the phthalimide units. The 8 series polyimides showed 
slightly lower Tg values as compared with their counterpart 8 series without the bulky 
adamantoxy substituent. This might be a result of reduced chain-to chain interaction 
and packing because of the bulky pendent groups. Typical TMA curves of a 
representative polyimide 8c is shown in Figure 4. The 8 series polyimides exhibited Ts 
values of 286-304 oC, which were comparable with or slightly lower than those of the 
8’ series. The TGA curves of a representative polyimide 8c in both air and nitrogen 
atmospheres are also shown in the inset of Figure 4. The Tds at 10% weight loss of the 
polyimides in nitrogen and air remained in the range of 524-581 oC and 518-567 oC, 
respectively. They left more than 43% char yield at 800 oC in nitrogen.  
 
Optical Properties. 
The optical properties of these polymers were investigated by UV-vis and PL 
spectroscopy . The polyamides exhibited strong UV–vis absorption bands at 313-364 
nm in NMP solution (10-5 M), assignable to the π-π* transition resulting from the 
triphenylamine moieties. Their PL spectra in NMP solution showed emission peaks 
 18
standard is 4.80 eV with respect to the zero vacuum level, the HOMO energy levels 
for all polymers estimated from their E1/2 values are also included in Table 5, 6. 
Electrochromic Properties. 
For the electrochromic investigations, all the polymer films were cast on an 
ITO-coated glass slide (a piece that fit in the commercial UV-visible cuvette), and a 
homemade electrochemical cell was built from a commercial UV-visible cuvette. The 
cell was placed in the optical path of the sample light beam in a commercial diode 
array spectrophotometer. This procedure allowed us to obtain electronic absorption 
spectra under potential control in a 0.1 M TBAP/CH3CN solution. Typical result of 
the film of polyamide 6d is presented in Figure 7 as a series of UV-vis absorbance 
curves correlated to electrode potentials. In the neutral form, at 0.00 V, the film 
exhibited strong absorption at wavelength around 339 nm, characteristic for 
triarylamine, but it was almost transparent in the visible region. Upon oxidation of the 
polyamide 6d film (increasing applied voltage from 0.00 to 1.00 V), the intensity of 
the absorption peak at 339 nm gradually decreased while new peaks at  399, 575 and 
795 nm gradually increased in intensity, and the color of the film changed to pale 
green. We attribute this spectral change to the formation of a stable monocation 
radical of the triphenylamine moiety.  
For optical switching studies, polymer films were cast on ITO-coated glass slides in 
the same manner as described above, and each film was potential stepped between its 
neutral (0.00 V) and oxidized (+1.00 V) state. While the films were switched, the 
absorbance at 805 nm was monitored as a function of time with UV-vis-NIR 
spectroscopy. Switching data for the cast film of polyamide 6d are given in Figure 8. 
The switching time was calculated at 90% of the full switch because it is difficult to 
perceive any further color change with naked eye beyond this point. Thin film of 
polyamide 6d required 4.30 s at 1.00 V for coloring and 1.42 s for bleaching,
