to evaluate the effectiveness of a 
manufacturing process. This index is 
defined as follows. 
 
Definition 2.1  Let π  be a 
manufacturing process with mean θ  and 
variance 2σ . T is the target value, and 
USL and LSL are the upper specification 
limit and lower specification limit, 
respectively. Then the process capability 
index of π  is defined as the following 
22 )(6 Tw
LSLUSLC pw −+
−= θσ , 
where w is a weight function. 
According to process capability index 
introduced as above, we define the best 
PCI-qualified manufacturing process as 
follows. 
 
Definition 2.2  Let kππ ,,1 L  be k 
manufacturing processes such that iπ  has 
mean iθ  variance 2iσ  and process 
capability index )(iC pw , ki ,,1L= . Let 
)0(pwC  be a control value (prefixed). 
Define S={ }kiCiC pwpwi ,,1),0()( L=≥π . 
A manufacturing process iπ  is called 
PCI-qualified, if ∈iπ S. A manufacturing 
process iπ  is considered as the best 
PCI-qualified, if it simultaneously satisfies 
the following conditions: 
   (i) ∈iπ S, and 
(ii) )(max)( jCiC pw

Let ),,( 1~ kθθθ L= , ),,( 1~ kσσσ L=  
and { ,0,),( >+∞<<∞−=Ω iiii σθσθ  
}ki ,,1L=  be the parameter space. Let 
),,,( 10~ kaaaa L= denote an action, when 
;1,0=ia ki ,,1,0 L= , and 10 =∑ =ki ia . If 
1=ia , for some ki ,,1L= , it means that 
manufacturing process iπ  is selected as 
the best PCI-qualified. When 10 =a , it 
means that no manufacturing process is 
considered as the best PCI-qualified, i.e. 
none in k manufacturing processes 
satisfied the restriction (i) in Definition 
2.1. Let Α={
~
a } denote the action space.  
In a decision-theoretic approach, we 
introduce the following loss function. 
  In this paper, we consider a Bayes 
approach for the problem of selecting the 
best PCI-qualified manufacturing process 
with normal distribution. 
   For each ki ,,1L= , let iMi XX ,,1 L  
be an independently random sample of 
size M from a normally distributed 
manufacturing process iπ  with mean iθ  
and variance 2iσ . The observed value is 
denoted by iMi xx ,,1 L . Let 
,/1 2ii στ = ki ,,1L= . It is assumed that 
),( ii τθ  is a realization of a random vector

3. The empirical Bayes selection rule 
   In the problem formulated in sec.2, 
we consider that kαα ,,1 L  are known, 
and ,1>iα for any ki ,,1L= . Since 
)(
~
ii xφ  still involves the unknown 
parameters iμ , kii ,,1, L=β , hence, 
the proposed Bayes selection Bd
~
 is not 
applicable. However, based on the past 
data, these unknown parameters can be 
estimated and a decision can be made if 
one more observation is taken. For 
ki ,,1L= , let ijtX  denote a sample of 
size M from iπ  with a normal 
distribution ),( 1−ititN τθ  at time t 
( nt ,,1L= ), Mj ,,1L=  and ( itit τθ , ) 
is a realization of a random vector 
( itit ΤΘ , ) which is an independent copy 
of ( ii ΤΘ , ) with a normal-gamma 
distribution described in preceding 
section. It is assumed that ( itit ΤΘ , ), 
ki ,,1L= , nt ,,1L= , are mutually 
independent. For our convenience, we 
denote the current random sample 
1+ijnX  by ijX , for Mj ,,1L= , 
ki ,,1L= . 
   For each iπ , ki ,,1L= , we 
estimate the unknown parameters iμ  
and iβ  based on the past data ijtX , 
Mj ,,1L= , nt ,,1L= . We denote 
   For ease of notation, we define inμ  
and inβ  as estimators of iμ  and iβ , 
respectively, by the following
