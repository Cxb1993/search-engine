Abstract--To follow the research topic namely 
Application of Power Electronics in the Electrical 
Vehicle Industry which is planned by the Electrical 
Power Engineering Division of the NSC, the major 
purpose of this project is to develop a bi-directional 
power flow and wide speed range motor drive for 
electrical scooters in the past one year. The project has 
successfully developed an interior permanent magnet 
brushless DC motor (IPM-BLDC) drive for electrical 
scooters. The major features of the developed drive 
include capability of regenerative braking and wider 
speed operating range than that of the traditional drive. 
These features are usually not considered or integrated 
in the conventional electrical scooter drives. 
Implementation of the drive uses a low cost digital 
signal processor as the control core and a voltage 
source inverter as the power conversion part. Some 
road tests by using the developed drive have also been 
conducted and some experimental waveforms are 
provided to show the performances of the developed 
drive.

2.1 前言 
本研究計畫的背景是針對 95 年國科會電力學門
所規劃的重點主題「電力電子於車輛產業之應用」，
配合政府發展高效能驅動與節能政策而提出之研究
計畫。近年來在各國政府紛紛積極推動經濟發展的
潮流下，人類對各種能源的處理態度可以用大量消
耗與大量浪費來形容，因此使地球終於面臨一些不
利人類永續生存的環境問題，例如地球近年來溫室
氣體（如二氧化碳）排放量遽增，科學家們紛紛預
言地球平均溫度將逐年升高，國際間也因此逐漸重
視各項有關能源與地球環保的議題並紛紛投入資源
制訂規範。在人類維持經濟發展與永續地球生命的
雙重思維下，為因應現在面臨的能源短缺、污染及
環保問題，各國已經紛紛積極研究並尋求解決之
道。人類的種種活動大量依靠各式輔助機器工具才
得以利用厚生，並產生事半功倍的效果。我們大量
使用內燃機燃燒汽油產生動能的交通工具，這些內
燃機於是大量排放二氧化碳來暖化地球，造成明顯
的溫室效應。在國內，我們可觀察在所有大都市或

內嵌式永磁同步電動機為 IPMSM，而內嵌式無刷直
流電動機簡稱為 IPM-BLDC，例如一般市售電動車
輛的驅動馬達多採用 IPM-BLDC 配合三組較便宜的
低解析度霍爾感測器來感測轉子位置，而本研究即
採用內含 IPM-BLDC 的電動機車來進行實驗測試。 
2.3 IPM-BLDC 寬速與再生煞車驅動控制策略 
無刷直流電動機可歸類為一種永磁同步電動
機，根據文獻[9]推導結果發現，具凸極效應的永磁
同步電動機在額定轉速以下，欲達到最低銅損運轉
必須控制永久磁石方向電流(一般稱為直軸電流)為
適當負值，也就是需要控制此電流使電動機合成磁
場大小稍低於永久磁石本身磁場，這種弱磁控制顯
現在馬達繞組上的電氣現象是繞組相電流超前馬達
相反電勢。而無刷直流電動機無論其轉子或定子結
構如何改變都仍具有些微凸極效應，雖然其反電勢
形狀不是理想的弦波，其轉子位置感測器解析度因
成本考量而降低，所以在沒有電流控制情形下導致
電流並非規則弦波或理想方波，然而，其驅動理念
仍可以引用上述論文結論以設計適當驅動控制裝置
達到較高效率運轉。圖 2 是反流器連接無刷直流馬
達的功率電路示意圖，而一般傳統的驅動方式產生
的電動機電流與反電勢的相對關係示意圖如圖 3 所
示，其中 A 相電流 Ai 如圖中箭頭所指實線部份，其
相位落後反電勢 ane ，原因是因繞組電阻 SR 與繞組漏
感 lsL 的時間常數造成，根據上述分析結果，傳統驅
動方式會造成馬達輸出轉矩降低[10]。欲改善此現
象，可以利用相位超前轉子位置驅動的方式，期望
能產生理想的馬達電流與反電勢的相對關係示意圖
如圖 4 所示，其中 A 相電流 Ai 如圖中箭頭所指實線
部份，其相位與反電勢 ane 同相，根據上述分析結果，
這種驅動方式產生的馬達輸出轉矩會較傳統驅動方
式增加，並產生較平順的輸出轉矩。對照圖 2與圖 3
中，當 S3 與 S6 切換結束，而 S2 與 S3 已經開始切
換的 A相與 C相電流換相時間，A相電流從 0開始增
加，B相電流維持固定，C相電流從穩態值延遲短暫
時間後開始下降，A 相與 C相的電路方程式分別是：

cnBnCB
C
lsCS evVdt
di
LiR  -+=+                (2) 
其中 ABV 是 AB 兩端的電壓， CBV 是 CB 兩端的電壓，
理想情況下 B相電流與反電勢維持固定值，所以 Bnv
電壓為某固定值，而在此換相過程中， CBV =0。在(1)
式中，當 S2與 S3 同時導通，A相電流上升的速度與
等式右端大小成正比，當 S2 截止，S3 維持導通時，
此時 A 相下臂的背接二極體導通使得 ABV =0，此時 A
相電流下降的速度與(1)式右端大小的絕對值成正
比，因為 S2 以波寬調變模式切換，使得最終 A相電
流仍以一階響應的上升趨勢達到定值。在(2)式中，
因 S6 與 S5 都截止，因換相初始階段，C相電流為正
值，此時 C相下臂的背接二極體導通使得 CBV =0，因
(2)式右端為負值，C相電流下降的速度與(2)式右端
大小的絕對值大小成正比，而最終 C 相電流是以一
階響應的下降趨勢達到定值。根據以上對電動機的 A
相與 C 相兩方程式在 A 相與 C 相換相階段的響應行
為分析可推知，在 A 相與 C 相電流換相區間的響應
都是一階的時間常數，所以我們可以設計驅動信號
所需超前的時間為適當的 x倍數時間常數(一般可選
擇 x 之值為 2~4 左右)，如此理想上可以得到如圖 4
所示的電流波形。根據以上所設計的超前驅動時間
可推導得到對應的超前驅動電氣角是 advθ 度：

其中 P是極數，rpm 是馬達每分鐘機械旋轉次數。 
以上所述是針對一般表面黏著式 BLDC 的驅動
特性作分析，今若針對 IPM-BLDC 而言，這種超前
驅動的方法有進一步的效果。根據文獻[9]結果可推
論，如果控制 IPM-BLDC 電流適當超前其反電勢，應
可以獲得與 IPMSM 相同的最小銅損控制的效果，同
時進一步能延伸其定轉矩區的速度範圍，達到高速
時仍能輸出高轉矩的性能。因為 IPM-BLDC 反電勢波
形為非純弦波，在理論分析上為非線性特性，而且
本驅動器的轉子位置感測器解析度較低，以拖曳電
機應用觀點而言，在前述條件限制下所研發驅動器
是朝最小銅損控制的方向進行，而實際理論分析與
計算因其複雜程度提高，尚待日後進一步深入研
析，本研究仍著重實際應用觀點，先實現此控制策
略，並驗證應用於電動機車的確可行。

three-phase BLDC motor with a trapezoidal back-emf is 
generally controlled as that the stator currents Ai , Bi , and Ci
have rectangular waveforms and they should be in phase 
with the corresponding motor back-emfs Ane , Bne , and Cne
respectively. Fig. 2 shows typical waveforms of the 
back-emfs Ane , Bne , Cne  and the desired currents Ai , Bi , Ci
with the corresponding generated constant power and six 
phase periods. In order to generate proper gating signals to 
control the phase currents, the rotor position information is 
necessary for a BLDC motor drive. If three Hall sensor 
signals are used to provide the rotor position information, six 
combinations can be found to form the six phase periods in 
one electrical cycle as shown in Fig. 2. 
As the rotor speed is below the base speed, the motor 
back-emf is less than the inverter DC link voltage. Hence, 
two of the motor phase windings with maximum back-emf 
can be excited by using PWM method to the corresponding 
inverter switches such that the amplitude of the line current 
can be regulated as desired. Fig. 3 shows the switching 
waveforms of a commonly used PWM scheme [9] for one 
electrical cycle. From Fig. 3, one can observe that in each 
phase period, only one switch has PWM switching action 
together with another switch fully turned on. This kind of 
PWM pattern lets the voltage stress of the winding be equal 
to the DC link voltage. It is commonly called the soft 
chopping method which differentiates the so called hard 
chopping method that the voltage stress of the winding is 
double of the DC link voltage. In addition, one can see that 
the gating signal of each switch is fixed at 120 electrical 
degrees in one electrical cycle. It is the commonly adopted 
120-degree conduction interval switching concept for BLDC 
motor drives [3]. As rotor speed is increased that inherently 
shows the motor back-emf getting high, the duty ratio of the 
PWM signal should be larger to provide higher terminal 
voltage such that the desired winding current can be 
obtained. However, as the duty ratio reaches 100%, the 
inverter gating signal of each switch becomes a 120 degree 
quasi-square waveform. Hence, the inverter terminal voltage 
reaches its maximum and the rotor speed can not be further 
increased as well. 
B. Above Base-Speed Switching Techniques 
To extend the operating speed range over the base speed, a 
field-weakening control scheme can be applied. The 
field-weakening control scheme for a BLDC motor drive 
was generally called the phase advance commutation 
scheme [3]. Fig. 4 shows the gating signals of the inverter 
switches for the phase advance commutation and 120-degree 
conduction interval scheme where the advanced phase angle 
is 30 degrees. For the phase period I in Fig. 4 as an example, 
S2 and S3 turn on in the first duration of 30 degrees which is 
the same as in Fig. 3 as its duty ratio is 100%. Then, the 
remaining duration of 30 degrees lets S2 and S5 turn on. In 
other words, the switching patterns in Fig. 4 are the same as 
the switching patterns of 30 degrees advancement of Fig. 3 
letting   the  PWM  duty  ratio  being  100%.  As  had  been

chart of the Extended Speed Range Control Scheme block. 
The principle of the scheme can be explained by the system 
block diagram and the flow chart as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 
8 respectively. As reference to Fig. 8, the program firstly 
check if rZ  is less than a threshold speed rTHZ  or not. If it is, 
an index named FWINDEX=1 and the maximum phase 
advance angle PAAMAX is calculated. Otherwise, 
FWINDEX=0 and the maximum PWM duty ratio DMAX is 
calculated. Then, u* is checked if it is less than a threshold 
control uTH or not. If it is, the program goes to flow chart 
SAT, otherwise the program goes to the flow chart NSAT. In 
flowchart SAT, the major purpose is to determine the control 
should be in phase advance commutation or in PWM control. 
If it is in the phase advance commutation, a proper value of 
PAA would be calculated and the gating signal patterns are 
determined accordingly. In flowchart NSAT, the purpose is 
to decide a proper value of duty ratio D for the PWM 
control. 
According to the algorithm of the flow chart in Fig. 8, the 
drive can operate over an extended speed range with indirect 
over load protection without using current sensors. Hence, it 
is a quite practical and cost effective BLDC motor drive. 
IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a 
speed controlled BLDC motor drive is built according to the 
system block diagram of Fig. 7. The core controller uses a 
DSP TMS320F2407A Evaluation Module and the power 
stage is a voltage source inverter. The specifications of the 
tested BLDC motor are 24V, 15A, 2550 r/min, 360W and 
the rotor position sensors are three Hall-effect sensors. The 
tested motor is coupled on the same shaft with a 1 kW PM 
generator loaded with a three-phase resistor bank. Different 
value of resistances of the three phase resistor bank is 
applied when different load is needed during the test. The 
inverter DC link voltage is 24V and the maximum DC link 
current is 15A. All control algorithms including the 
proposed scheme are implemented in the software.  
Several test results illustrate the features of the proposed 
scheme in the remaining paragraph. First, a step speed 
command of *rZ =500 r/min is assigned to the tested drive 
starting from rest at t=0 s with no load resistors connected to 
the PM generator. After the speed reaches the steady state, a 
sudden block of the rotor is applied at t=3.85 sec. As can be 
seen in Fig. 9, the maximum DC link current is finally 
limited at about 15A by the controller. For the second test is 
that a step speed command of *rZ =5000 r/min is assigned to 
the tested drive starting from rest at t=0 s with no load 
resistors connected to the PM generator. As shown in Fig. 10, 
the field-weakening control starts at about t=0.72 sec until 
the speed reaches the steady state of 5000 r/min. Then a 
heavy load is suddenly applied at about t=4.36 sec. The 
maximum DC link current is increased until at about 15A. 
However, the steady state speed is lower than the desired 
speed because of the limited current amplitude. Finally,  the  
third  test  is  that  a  step  speed  command  of  
*
rZ =5000 r/min is assigned to the tested drive starting from 
rest at t=0 s with a heavy load connected to the PM generator. 
The experimental result shows that even the drive is 
operated under its over load condition in the field weakening 
region, the heavier load causes only the smaller speed but the 
DC link current is still kept approximately at its limit. As 
shown in Fig. 11, from t=4.12 sec to t=6.39 sec, a heavier 
load is applied such that the speed gets down to 3420 r/min. 
However, the DC link current is still kept at about its limit of 
15A. 
The above experimental results show that the proposed 
scheme can achieve a wide speed range control of a BLDC 
motor drive. In addition, the controller shows an indirect 
over load protection feature such that no current sensor is 
needed in the drive.

幾天中，報告人在成都市區發現市民的交通工具有一項與台灣有極大差異，成都市民大量使
用電動腳踏車與電動機車代步，市區幾乎沒有燃油機車出現，所以市區只有汽車燃油排放廢
氣。而在台灣，大部分人民使用燃油機車代步，這期間的差異與兩者間的優缺點值得再探討。

back-emfs Ane , Bne , Cne  and the desired currents Ai , Bi , Ci
with the corresponding generated constant power and six 
phase periods. In order to generate proper gating signals to 
control the phase currents, the rotor position information is 
necessary for a BLDC motor drive. If three Hall sensor 
signals are used to provide the rotor position information, six 
combinations can be found to form the six phase periods in 
one electrical cycle as shown in Fig. 2. 
As the rotor speed is below the base speed, the motor 
back-emf is less than the inverter DC link voltage. Hence, 
two of the motor phase windings with maximum back-emf 
can be excited by using PWM method to the corresponding 
inverter switches such that the amplitude of the line current 
can be regulated as desired. Fig. 3 shows the switching 
waveforms of a commonly used PWM scheme [9] for one 
electrical cycle. From Fig. 3, one can observe that in each 
phase period, only one switch has PWM switching action 
together with another switch fully turned on. This kind of 
PWM pattern lets the voltage stress of the winding be equal 
to the DC link voltage. It is commonly called the soft 
chopping method which differentiates the so called hard 
chopping method that the voltage stress of the winding is 
double of the DC link voltage. In addition, one can see that 
the gating signal of each switch is fixed at 120 electrical 
degrees in one electrical cycle. It is the commonly adopted 
120-degree conduction interval switching concept for BLDC 
motor drives [3]. As rotor speed is increased that inherently 
shows the motor back-emf getting high, the duty ratio of the 
PWM signal should be larger to provide higher terminal 
voltage such that the desired winding current can be 
obtained. However, as the duty ratio reaches 100%, the 
inverter gating signal of each switch becomes a 120 degree 
quasi-square waveform. Hence, the inverter terminal voltage 
reaches its maximum and the rotor speed can not be further 
increased as well. 
B. Above Base-Speed Switching Techniques 
To extend the operating speed range over the base speed, a 
field-weakening control scheme can be applied. The 
field-weakening control scheme for a BLDC motor drive 
was generally called the phase advance commutation 
scheme [3]. Fig. 4 shows the gating signals of the inverter 
switches for the phase advance commutation and 120-degree 
conduction interval scheme where the advanced phase angle 
is 30 degrees. For the phase period I in Fig. 4 as an example, 
S2 and S3 turn on in the first duration of 30 degrees which is 
the same as in Fig. 3 as its duty ratio is 100%. Then, the 
remaining duration of 30 degrees lets S2 and S5 turn on. In 
other words, the switching patterns in Fig. 4 are the same as 
the switching patterns of 30 degrees advancement of Fig. 3 
letting   the  PWM  duty  ratio  being  100%.  As  had  been

chart of the Extended Speed Range Control Scheme block. 
The principle of the scheme can be explained by the system 
block diagram and the flow chart as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 
8 respectively. As reference to Fig. 8, the program firstly 
check if rZ  is less than a threshold speed rTHZ  or not. If it is, 
an index named FWINDEX=1 and the maximum phase 
advance angle PAAMAX is calculated. Otherwise, 
FWINDEX=0 and the maximum PWM duty ratio DMAX is 
calculated. Then, u* is checked if it is less than a threshold 
control uTH or not. If it is, the program goes to flow chart 
SAT, otherwise the program goes to the flow chart NSAT. In 
flowchart SAT, the major purpose is to determine the control 
should be in phase advance commutation or in PWM control. 
If it is in the phase advance commutation, a proper value of 
PAA would be calculated and the gating signal patterns are 
determined accordingly. In flowchart NSAT, the purpose is 
to decide a proper value of duty ratio D for the PWM 
control. 
According to the algorithm of the flow chart in Fig. 8, the 
drive can operate over an extended speed range with indirect 
over load protection without using current sensors. Hence, it 
is a quite practical and cost effective BLDC motor drive. 
IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a 
speed controlled BLDC motor drive is built according to the 
system block diagram of Fig. 7. The core controller uses a 
DSP TMS320F2407A Evaluation Module and the power 
stage is a voltage source inverter. The specifications of the 
tested BLDC motor are 24V, 15A, 2550 r/min, 360W and 
the rotor position sensors are three Hall-effect sensors. The 
tested motor is coupled on the same shaft with a 1 kW PM 
generator loaded with a three-phase resistor bank. Different 
value of resistances of the three phase resistor bank is 
applied when different load is needed during the test. The 
inverter DC link voltage is 24V and the maximum DC link 
current is 15A. All control algorithms including the 
proposed scheme are implemented in the software.  
Several test results illustrate the features of the proposed 
scheme in the remaining paragraph. First, a step speed 
command of *rZ =500 r/min is assigned to the tested drive 
starting from rest at t=0 s with no load resistors connected to 
the PM generator. After the speed reaches the steady state, a 
sudden block of the rotor is applied at t=3.85 sec. As can be 
seen in Fig. 9, the maximum DC link current is finally 
limited at about 15A by the controller. For the second test is 
that a step speed command of *rZ =5000 r/min is assigned to 
the tested drive starting from rest at t=0 s with no load 
resistors connected to the PM generator. As shown in Fig. 10, 
the field-weakening control starts at about t=0.72 sec until 
the speed reaches the steady state of 5000 r/min. Then a 
heavy load is suddenly applied at about t=4.36 sec. The 
maximum DC link current is increased until at about 15A. 
However, the steady state speed is lower than the desired 
speed because of the limited current amplitude. Finally,  the  
third  test  is  that  a  step  speed  command  of  
*
rZ =5000 r/min is assigned to the tested drive starting from 
rest at t=0 s with a heavy load connected to the PM generator. 
The experimental result shows that even the drive is 
operated under its over load condition in the field weakening 
region, the heavier load causes only the smaller speed but the 
DC link current is still kept approximately at its limit. As 
shown in Fig. 11, from t=4.12 sec to t=6.39 sec, a heavier 
load is applied such that the speed gets down to 3420 r/min. 
However, the DC link current is still kept at about its limit of 
15A. 
The above experimental results show that the proposed 
scheme can achieve a wide speed range control of a BLDC 
motor drive. In addition, the controller shows an indirect 
over load protection feature such that no current sensor is 
needed in the drive.
