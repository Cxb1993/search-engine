I. INTRODUCTION 
The complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor 
(CMOS) process is applied to radio frequency 
integrated circuit (RFIC) designs because of its 
superior ability for integration and lower 
production costs than III-V semiconductor 
processes. But, in the CMOS thin film metal 
process, metal thickness is close to skin depth, δ, 
in the range of the RF application frequency bands. 
Thus, one must carefully consider the changes in 
electrical performances of commonly used 
transmission lines (TLs), such as microstrips (MSs) 
and coplanar waveguides (CPWs), with the applied 
frequency, which changes characteristic 
impedance (ZC), loss and the slow wave factor 
(SWF) [1–3]. However, when designing passive 
elements, demands are strong for decreased loss 
and downsized circuit area to enhance circuit 
performance and reduce productive cost. Many 
TLs have been developed and designed in response 
to these demands. For example, a designed TL 
which is combined by MS and CPW structures 
increases metal structure thickness and that 
reduces conductor losses; and extends application 
scope of characteristic impedance by adjusting 
structure parameters [4]. Other examples improved 
passive circuit performance and reduced circuit 
dimensions by applying meandered MS TLs and a 
multi-layer structure to enhance the coupling effect 
of the directional coupler [5, 6]. Slow wave 
structures are achieved by altering MS TL 
structures, such that they generate a capacitive 
section and inductive section and display 
periodical changes that further reduce circuit area 
and improve markedly the electrical characteristics 
of TLs [5, 7–11]. The achievement of a three-
dimensional (3-D) circuit layout reduces chip area 
by employing planar multi-layer and vertical 
structural designs with integrated components [12–
14]. The application of a synthesized quasi-TEM 
TL, also called a complementary-conducting-strip 
(CCS) TL [9], is an innovative two-dimensional 
(2-D) TL structure with low losses and planar 
structure parameters that allow for flexible 
adjustments during the design process, highly 
miniaturized ability and other outstanding 
performances [9–11]. Such a structure can be 
utilized when designing various monolithic 
microwave ICs/hybrid microwave ICs 
(MMICs/HMICs). Previous research has largely 
summarized the design rules this TL. For instance, 
increasing the ratio of the unit-cell period, P, to 
hole width, Wh, and using the parallel connection 
design of the multi-layer metal, serial resistance 
can be decreased in a TL, also Q value is improved; 
further, such CCS design matched the average 
metal density (AMD) in CMOS process 
specifications. Additionally, CCS TLs has 
excellent miniaturized results on circuit design [10, 
11]. This study investigates in-depth the qualitative 
and quantitative effects of multi-metal parallel 
layers on the guiding characteristics of CCS 
structures, and optimal design guidelines for multi-
layer CCS structures. This study further applies the 
multi-layer metal framework to achieve the 
optimal design mode that decreases both losses 
and circuit area. The parameters of the standard 
CMOS 0.18µm 1P6M RF process are utilized to 
analyze the synthetic quasi-TEM TL using a 3-D 
full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulator (Ansoft 
HFSSTM). The remainder of this paper is organized 
as follows. Section 2 further determines how metal 
pad thickness on grounding and CCS signal layers 
in CCS TLs reduces losses, and achieves optimal 
design guidelines that decrease losses, increase Q 
values and the SWF, and miniaturize circuits in the 
band of 2 – 67 GHz. In Section 3, the guidelines 
for multi-layer CCS TL designs are applied to 
design low-loss miniaturized circuits. The 
frequency of 60 GHz, which is a bandwidth that 
does not require a license, according to Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) bandwidth 
specifications and the industrial, scientific and 
medical (ISM) radio bands [15], has been widely 
utilized for short-distance wireless transmission. 
Hence, this study chooses the 180° hybrid at 60 
GHz for design and practice purposes, and to 
verify simulation and analytical results. Section 4 
presents conclusions. 
II. Study of guiding properties of CCS 
TLs in the CMOS multi-layer 
framework 
 The metal thickness in CMOS process in RF 
band is equivalent to, or even less than, the skin 
depth, δ, of the same process, with those in 
M1~M5 layers at 0.5 µm and those in M6 layer at 
2.3 µm; the relation between skin depth and 
frequency is as Fig. 1 shows. It is clear from Fig. 1 
that the metal thickness in M1~M5 is less than 
skin depth before 30 GHz and is approximately 
equivalent to skin depth after 30 GHz; hence, if TL 
structure is designed with single-layer metal, the 
3 
 
The increasing rate of Q slows down if patch is 
thickened; the value for Q of M6M1-M5M1 will 
be below that of M6-M5 at 25 GHz and above. 
Last, by integrating the relative variation rates in 
guiding properties of the relevant CCS TLs (Fig. 4) 
and the design guidelines of the multi-layer CCS 
TL (Table I) are obtained. According to fig. 4 and 
Table 1, when using a single CCS signal layer, 
losses can be reduced and Q values increased by 
simply connecting two layers of grounding metal 
in parallel, and that with satisfactory improvement 
without the need to connect too many metal layers 
in parallel. Therefore, the idle metal layers M1–
M3 can be used in multi-layer circuit design. 
Given the different metal thicknesses of M1~M5 
and M6, this research recommend using M2M1 
(i.e., M2-VIA12-M1) in the layout of the lower 
layer signal lines, and M4 and M5M4 as a 
reference in grounding layers to achieve the same 
metal thickness as M6.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In the application of the CMOS multi-layer 
process, making the metal thickness at least twice 
skin depth can significantly reduce losses and 
increase Q values. In CCS TL structures, a thick 
grounding structure further reduces losses; 
however, the rate, i.e., the efficiency, of loss 
reduction decreases as layer thickness increases. 
When two layers of grounding metal are connected 
in parallel, the CCS TL designed with 
characteristic impedances of 70 Ω can decrease 
loss by 10.97%, and the improvements to the Q 
values are as high as 12.66%. Conversely, a 
thickened CCS signal patch can increase SWF 
values; however, this patch is accompanied by 
increased losses. Therefore, the choice between 
reduced loss and high SWF values must be made 
according to user needs. The application of design 
guidelines for a multi-layer CCS TL, together with 
the layout of signal lines on idle metal layers, can 
further reduce circuit area. Therefore, a 180° 
hybrid has been operated in the 60 GHz band 
according to the method which was mentioned 
above. Moreover, area of the hybrid is only 180.0 
µm × 240.0 µm (1.728 × 10-3 λ02). In the future, 
when designing wireless communication system 
chips and related RF microwave circuit 
components by the CMOS 0.18µm 1P6M multi-
layer metal framework, utilizing CCS TLs are 
certainly capable of both loss and circuit area 
reductions in design applications.
