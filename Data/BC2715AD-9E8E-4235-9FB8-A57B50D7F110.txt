摘要： 
數位浮水印技術主要應用於法律、醫學影像系統、軍事影像系統等領域中，
希望在萃取浮水印後都必須要能夠無失真的將浮水印影像恢復成原始影像。但是
目前被提出的可逆浮水印演算法可隱藏的資訊容量都不大，再加上可逆浮水印對
於抵抗幾何攻擊是很脆弱的，其強健性是有待加強。因此本計畫針對可逆浮水印
演算法的缺點加以改進，發展出高容量且可抵抗幾何攻擊的可逆浮水印技術。 
本計畫中，主要完成以下兩項內容：(1)設計出高容量可逆浮水印技術，提
升目前被提出的可逆浮水印演算法可藏匿的資訊容量；(2)抵抗幾何攻擊增加可
逆浮水印的強健性。本計畫中，我們利用本團隊在浮水印相關領域內的深厚研究
基礎及理論，透過各項浮水印理論方面的研究，推展可逆浮水印的發展並使其完
善，應用於實際需求上，對於學術界及產業界能有重大的貢獻。

擴展的h紀錄成 1，其他的位置則紀錄成 0。並且在萃取的過程中不需要任何的
額外資訊。為了節省空間，位置圖 L 需要被壓縮且嵌入到影像當中。

L 很難被高位元率壓縮，可能所有擴展類的差值不能攜

PSNR 值的下降。 
在本計畫中我們使用壓縮和擴展( Companding ) 技術，使 也能被擴

Abstract 
 
This paper proposes a visual secret sharing scheme 
for color image encryption with robust and progressive 
decryption abilities. Robust decryption means the 
secret content can be still decrypted from shares even 
the shares are corrupted with intentional or 
unintentional alterations. In progressive decryption, 
three levels quality of secret images can be decrypted 
with the same shares. A lower visual quality secret 
content can be revealed by stacking shares. A halftone 
version of secret can be decrypted by simple XOR 
shares. Furthermore, a nearly lossless version of the 
secret content can be reconstructed by a decoding 
procedure. The method is cooperated with data hiding 
technique which has two functions, one is for encoding 
some secret content and the other is for embedding 
some extra information, e.g., permutation key. 
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the 
proposed method. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Visual cryptography is a paradigm introduced by 
Naor and Shamir [1] to encrypt a secret image into two 
or more random noise-like share images. Generally, a 
visual cryptography scheme is designed based on a {k, 
n}-threshold framework. That is, a secret image is 
encrypted into n shares distributed to n participants. 
Via stacking some k or more than k shares, the secret 
content is revealed by the human visual system. 
Nowadays a lot of visual cryptography schemes have 
been proposed for halftone, gray-scale [2, 3] and color 
image [4] encryption. The key advantage of visual 
cryptography compared with conventional 
cryptography algorithms lies in that no computations 
or prior knowledge (e.g., a key) are required in secret 
image decryption.  
In most available visual cryptography methods, the 
distortion such as changes in contrast and resolution is 
inevitably introduced during secret image decryption. 
However, in some practical application scenarios the 
secret image is required to be reconstructed more 
accurately. For example, Lukac et al. [5] proposed an 
effective image sharing scheme that can perfectly 
retrieve the secret image using bit-level logical 
operations. Although their scheme loses the ability of 
decryption by visual means, it still has potentially wide 
applications in the Internet world popular with digital 
contents.  
Data hiding refers to hide data unnoticeable in cover 
media which usually used for multimedia copyright 
protection, tamper detection, content authentication, 
etc. In recent years, data hiding techniques are 
involved in VSS schemes. Fang et al. [6] proposed a 
method for hiding some confidential data in shares of 
VSS. In fact, embedding extra data in shares has many 
potential applications. But most of these methods focus 
on hiding some affiliated information of the secret 
image such as author’s name, production date, license 
number, content annotation, etc.  
This paper focuses on a novel visual secret sharing 
(VSS) scheme cooperated with data hiding techniques. 
Contribution of our work lies in three aspects. (1) 
Progressive decryption. There are three levels of visual 
quality can be obtained. The lowest quality content is 
revealed by stacking shares. While a halftone version 
of the secret image is obtained by extracting and 
reconstructed some decrypted pixels. Furthermore, a 
nearly lossless version of the secret image can be 
recovered by a decoding procedure. (2) Robust 
decryption. In distribution, shares are easily to be 
corrupted including unintentional alterations such as 
The key idea of Jin et al’s method is to encode a 
gray level image into a binary transparency first. As 
shown in Figure 2, each secret image pixel’s 8 bit-
plane information (b1, b2, …, b8) is assigned in a 3×3 
block. The center position of this 3×3 block is used to 
carry a halftone pixel corresponding to the same 
position of secret image. Then the binary block is 
mapped into another one according to a look-up table 
constructed with the metric of Hamming weight in 
advance. This operation aims for making average 
luminance of the mapped block is approximately equal 
to that of the secret pixel. After that, the new 3×3 block 
is encrypted using the conventional {2, 2} VSS and 
thus two shares are produced. Note that, in decryption, 
the same look-up table must be used for decoding 
blocks. Hence, three hierarchical levels of decrypted 
images can be obtained by just stacking, XOR or with 
more complex computations.

3. Proposed method 
 
3.1. Overview 
 
The block diagram of encryption and decryption is 
shown in Figure 3. In encryption as shown in Figure 
3(a), the secret image S is transformed into a halftone 
image H, and then a transition image T is constructed 
according to the secret image and halftone image. 
Next, the transition image is encrypted based on non-
expansion VSS model. Meanwhile, part of the secret 
image is encoded in the transition image and another 
part is embedded in shares during encryption. 
As shown in Figure 3(b), secret content with level 1 
visual quality can be viewed by stacking the two 
shares. To decrypt the level 2 and 3 quality secret, S1 is 
XORed with S2. Then secret with level 2 quality 
(halftone version of secret image) can be obtained by a 
simple mechanism of extracting and rearranging pixels 
of the XORed result. Furthermore, if necessary, the 
original secret image can be nearly losslessly recovered 
by decoding based on the reconstructed transition 
image.  
 
3.2. Data Hiding During Encryption 
 
Here we propose a general method for hiding data 
during encryption based on the non-expansion VSS 
model. Suppose a secret binary sequence s={s1,s2…,sj} 
is encrypted into two binary sequence shares S1 and S2. 
The data hiding principle is shown in Figure 4 and 
details are described as follows.

on the non-expansion {2, 2} VSS model 
First, s1 is encrypted in 11p  and 
2
1p . Randomly 
select a white or black pixel and assign it to 11p , and 
then 21p  is determined by 11p  and the s1 as

Second, w1 is encrypted in 21p  and 12p . That is, 
1

is determined by 21p  and w1 according to Eq. (2).

2

determined by 12p  and s2 according to Eq. (3).

Now we only need to encrypt the transition image T 
and hiding the second group of each psb information at 
the same time. Before encryption, the 4×4 block of tb 
can be rearranged into a 1×16 binary sequence, and 
thus the encryption strategy can be used.  
One of the most important advantages of 
conventional VSS schemes is no key is required during 
decryption. If a key is involved, some storage space is 
needed, and secure transmission of it is also a sensitive 
problem. However, although a permutation key is used 
in our scheme, the original flexibility of the 
conventional VSS schemes is still maintained for the 
key is also hidden in shares during the Key bit 
encryption. To a k1×k2 secret image S, k1/2×k2/2 bits 
can be provided for key embedding.  
 
4. Experimental results and Discussions 
 
A modified PSNR [9] is adopted to evaluate the 
image quality of the reconstructed secret color image 
compared with the original secret image given as

where Ros(i, j), Gos(i, j) and  Bos(i, j) denote the R,G, B 
channels of the original secret image, and Rrs(i, j), Grs(i, 
j) and  Brs(i, j) denote those of the reconstruct secret 
image. A higher PSNR value corresponds to better 
quality of the reconstructed image.  
Experimental results with shares no attack suffered 
are shown in Figure 7 with the real size of images are 
also indicated. Three levels of decrypt secret content 
can be obtained. The PSNR between the highest 
quality reconstructed image and the original image is 
27.14.  
Another experiment with shared are attacked is also 
implemented. As shown in Figure 8, the two shares are 
marked with characters, although the stacking result is 
not satisfactory, the reconstructed halftone and level 3 
images are of better qualities.  
It is necessary to note that, although the permutation 
key is of a short binary sequence, we encrypt is with an 
image as shown in Figure 7(c). Consequently, even 
shared are attacked, this strategy is useful to keep the 
key information “robust” to some extent. For example, 
in the second experiment, it can be distinguished 
clearly in Figure 8(d). A comparison of the proposed 
method with Jin et al’s method is shown in Table 1. 
We can find that our scheme outperforms it in some 
aspects.  
 
5. Conclusions 
 
A color image secret sharing scheme is proposed. 
The scheme has the ability to robust and progressive 
decryption. It can be used in situations when shares 
suffer alterations. The one-encryption, multiple 
decryption strategy provides flexibility with which 
different decryption image qualities can be obtained. 
The method improves the performance of the previous 
methods in some aspects.

Abstract
In this paper, we proposed a parity modulation 
based digital image watermarking scheme in DWT 
domain, focusing on resisting cropping attack. The 
watermark is embedded in the  subband 
coefficients of DWT by the parity modulation method.  
Experimental results show that the proposed 
watermarking method  can resist not only cropping 
attack, but also some common signal processing 
attacks, such as JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, 
and filtering etc.

1. Introduction 
Digital watermarking technique is one way to 
embed certain secret information into the digital media 
for the purpose of copyright protection, facticity and 
integrality‘s authentication, access control, tracing, 
covert communication etc [1]. Traditionally, the 
watermark is embedded in the spatial domain or the 
transformed domains such as DCT and DWT. From the 
aspect of application, the watermarking technique can 
be separated into two classes, the fragile watermarking 
technique and the robust watermarking technique. The 
former is mainly used in facticity and integrality‘s 
authentication, the later is mainly used in copyright 
protection etc. The robust watermark should resist not 
only common signal processing attacks, but also some 
uncommon attacks, such as geometrical attack, sticking 
attack etc. In general, the geometrical attack contains 
cropping, rotation, enlarging and shrinking etc.  
In this paper, we proposed a parity modulation 
based digital image watermarking scheme in DWT 
domain, focusing on resisting cropping attack. 
Generally, in order to resist the geometrical attack, the 
synchronizing template is needed [2-4]. The former 
schemes which can resist to geometrical attack are 
mainly in DFT domain, which have lower robustness 
to other attacks. In reference [5], the authors proposed 
a CDMA based watermarking scheme to resist the 
cropping attack, it also needs a synchronizing template. 
While our method can resist the cropping attack with 
no aid of the synchronizing template. If with the aid of 
synchronizing template, our scheme will resist other 
geometrical attacks, such as rotation, enlarging and 
shrinking. In this paper, a comparison between the 
special and the transformation domain based 
watermarking method is carried out. From the 
experimental results, we can see that, with the same 
embedding and extracting method, the spacial domain 
based method has better robustness to geometrical 
attacks, but very vulnerable to JPEG compression, 
Gaussian noise and filtering. While the transformation 
domain based method are very robust to cropping, 
JPEG compression , Gaussian noise and filtering, but if 
with no aid of the synchronizing template, it is 
vulnerable to rotation, enlarging and shrinking attacks. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows, in 
section 2, the detailed procedure of the proposed 
algorithm is given. In section 3, the experimental 
results are presented. We conclude the paper in section 
4.
2. Proposed watermarking scheme 
     In this paper, the watermark is embedded in the 
 subband coefficients of DWT by the parity 
modulation method, the detailed embedding and 
extracting steps can be described as follows.

Abstract 
The attack detection and information security for 
computer network become popular topics for many 
researchers in recent years. In this paper, the PCA-
ICA method for attack and intrusion detection is 
proposed. According to the experimental result, the 
proposed method performs higher correct ratio on 
recognition than the PCA. 
1. Introduction 
The development of computer network brings the 
convenience for information exchanging. After the 
information passing on the internet smoothly, the 
attack detection and information security for computer 
network become popular topics for many researchers. 
Hence, the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
is generated. 
Papers regarding intrusion usually use KDD-Cup-
99 to be the database for simulating various kinds of 
attack and intrusion. In this paper, the Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to fetch the 
major characteristics of the database, and then the 
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied to 
reduce the dimension of the major characteristics for 
raising the performance. Moreover, the Independent 
Component Analysis (ICA) is applied to create the 
independent sub-space for attack and intrusion 
detection. According to the experimental result, the 
proposed method, PCA-ICA, perform higher correct 
ratio on recognition than PCA. 
2. The KDD-Cup-99 
The KDD-Cup-99 is a database, which is developed 
for simulating the attack modes on the computer 
network, by Lincoln Lab., MIT in 1998. [1] It is 
usually applied for simulating the attack modes and for 
detecting the intrusion. The simulations are processed 
by collecting all kinds of connections, package flow, 
and several abnormal situations under the TCP/IP 
environment. 
The KDD-Cup-99 is composed of a known attack 
connection record, and an unknown dataset connection 
record. In general, the abnormal situation is classified 
into 4 classes, and 22 attack modes. The classification 
is listed in Table 1. The classes of the abnormal 
situation can be described as follows: 
 DOS: Denial-of-service, e.g. Syn flood. 
 R2L: Unauthorized access from a remote 
machine, e.g. guessing password. 
 U2R: Unauthorized access to local super user 
(root) privileges, e.g., various ``buffer 
overflow'' attacks. 
 Probing: Surveillance and other probing, e.g., 
port scanning.

In the KDD-Cup-99, every row in the database 
denotes a complete network connection record. There 
are 42 attributes in each record. The last column 
denotes whether it is an attack or a normal connection. 
An example of the connection record is displayed in 
Figure 1. Obviously, dataset like this must be 
preprocessed before applying to the detection methods. 
The detail of how to reformat the data is represented 
later.

sample and the training samples. Then the class, who is 
the closest to the test sample, is presented. Figure 2 
represents the flow chart of the experiment. 
Figure 2. The flowchart of the experiment 
During the training, analyzing the known 
connection records is required. As we mentioned 
above, the datasets in KDD-Cup-99 is classified into 4
classes, namely, DOS, R2L, U2R, and Probing, we add 
a class, which includes the normal connection records, 
to be the 5th class to identify the regular connection. To 
apply ICA transform, permuting the input data into a 
one-dimensional vector is required. By applying 
equation (1), we can get the mean vector Ӵ .
According to equation (2), the covariance matrix C is
calculated. However, the outcome from the PCA has 
the same dimension as the input data; this is not 
suitable for real time network detection. To solve this 
problem, we apply the SVD to reduce the dimension 
[4]. Hence, the equation (2) can be rewritten into 
equation (8), and then the covariance matrix C, the 
eigenvalue and the eigenvector can be measured by 
equation (4).

Since we have applied SVD to the outcome of the 
PCA, we can directly take n  outcomes of SVD to 
construct the sub-spaces. This process is represented in 
equation (9), where iU  is the ith eigenvector of the 
covariance matrix C, and iO  denotes the 
corresponding eigenvalue. In equation (10), the 
original training data X  is projected into the sub-
spaces.

To lead in the ICA scheme, we apply the eigenvalue 
W , which comes from the outcome of the PCA, into 
equation (4) to equation (7) to create a new sub-space. 
Based on the independent sub-space from the ICA, 
equation (10) can be rewritten to be (10.1), where P
denotes the independent basis, which is calculated by 
the ICA. Hence, the training sample can be projected 
into the new sub-space, which is created by ICA, via 
equation (10.1). Thus, the training phase is 
accomplished.

To examine the outcome of the proposed method, 
we project the test samples into the sub-space by 
equation (10.1), and then apply equation (11) to 
calculate the Euclidean distances between the test 
sample and all the training samples.

If the shortest distance exists between the test 
sample and the regular connection on the sub-space, 
the outcome of this test sample is determined to be a 
normal connection. On the other hand, if the shortest 
distance exists between the test sample and any kind of 
the attack record on the sub-space, the outcome of this 
test sample is determined to be the corresponding 
attack, and the alarm is issued. 
6. Experimental Results 
In the experiment, we divide the connection records 
from the KDD-Cup-99 into 5 classes; and in each class, 
we divide it into the training samples and the test 
samples. In other words, there are 26 training samples 
and 26 test samples in every class. We compare the 
correct ratio on recognition and the process time of the 
proposed method to the PCA. 
Figure 3 represents the result of the PCA and the 
PCA-ICA with different numbers of eigenvectors to 
the correct ratio on recognition. According to the 
experimental result, both the PCA and the PCA-ICA 
present correct ratio at 96.92% when the number of the 
selected eigenvectors is larger than 5.

PCA-ICA with different numbers of training samples
