Abstract 
 
With the rapid change of lifestyle, the 
issue of elder driving has been widely 
concerned. For the aged, physiological and 
mental declines limit their driving abilities 
and influence their driving safety. Although 
researchers have suggested that Advanced 
Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) may be 
a way of maintaining mobility and 
well-being in elder drivers, it may cause 
unexpected risks of accidents when 
performing more tasks. 
This study attempts to investigate the 
age effects of ATIS and cell phone use in 
driving on objective task performance and 
subjective driver workload. Further, it 
explores whether drivers in different age 
have different performance under various 
driving and communication tasks for limited 
mental resources. Finally, it provides 
implications into how people should balance 
driving and secondary tasks to maintain good 
driving performance. Thirty-two subjects of 
the old and the young participated in the 
study by a driving simulator. Task 
performance was measured in terms of time 
to collision (TTC) in the following task and 
subjective workload was measured using 
NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). 
Results showed a striking effect of age 
on driving behavior. For the subjects of the 
study with phone conversation, the analysis 
indicated that there might be more dangerous 
occurrence of collision, especially for elder 
subjects. Moreover, ATIS had no significant 
effects on both time to collision and mental 
workload ratings. That might be attributed to 
ignoring the system display and the anxiety 
of self-exposure. To conclude, this study may 
be of importance in explaining the driving 
behavior of different age groups with a better 
understanding of how drivers keep good 
driving performance and safety.

Background and Motivation 
 
According to the interpretation of the 
World Health Organization (WHO), when 
the aged over 65 years old divided by the 
total population of a country reaches to 7%, 
we can say the country is an aged society. 
Statistical data also presents that the 
proportion is climbing from 7.02% to 9.74% 
in Taiwan since 1993 to the end of 2005, and

workload. 2. Exploring whether drivers in 
different age have different performance 
under various driving and communication 
tasks for limited mental resources. 3. 
Providing implications into how drivers 
should balance driving and secondary tasks 
to maintain good driving performance. 
 
Literature Review 
   
As people approach old age, several 
abilities related to safe driving begin to 
decline (Eby et al., 1998). In Taiwan, older 
adults show the fastest growing segment of 
population. Numbers of senior drivers will 
grow at an even faster rate, as more elderly 
people and minorities are licensed and as 
those already having licenses maintain them 
longer. According to OECD (Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development, 
2001), in many OECD member countries, 
one in four persons will be aged 65 or over in 
2030. Likewise in Taiwan, the issue should 
be concerned for the safety of these older 
drivers.   
Numerous studies (Schlag, 1993; Stutts et 
al., 1998; Eby & Kostyniuk, 1998) have 
stressed that various aspects of perceptual, 
cognitive, and psychomotor ability which are 
relevant to driving tend to degrade with 
increasing age. Deficits in driving-related 
abilities seriously deteriorate driving 
performance by impairing a driver’s ability 
to see, recognize, decide, and act to driving 
tasks (Llaneras et al., 1998). The aspect treats 
these declining skills with augmented age, 
including perceptual, cognitive, and 
psychomotor abilities which related to safe 
driving begin to fail, and also discusses the 
traffic accidents of the older drivers in 
Taiwan. 
Undoubtedly, the most important 
perceptual abilities associated with driving 
are visual abilities. The paper in Malfetti and 
Winter (1986) provide that drivers acquire 
between 85% to 90% of the information 
necessary to drive via visual system inputs. 
Because of the importance of visual 
information, deteriorating visual abilities 
may be viewed to lead to poor driving 
performance and increased travel accidents. 
  In 1998, Eby and Kostyniuk have 
summarized previous research and indicated 
that as people get into older adulthood, the 
amount of light reaching the retina is 
decreased, sensitivity to glare is increased, 
eye movements become more difficult, 
acuity is decreased, the size of the useful 
visual field is reduced, sensitivity to motion 
is decreased, and colour discrimination is 
progressively lost.  
  Llaneras et al.’s theories (1998) offer 
summary information on relationships among 
these perceptual abilities, age, and driving 
performance; each of the driving-related 
perceptual abilities which contain the ability 
to resolve details of a stationary object, and 
of a moving object, the ability to detect 
targets of varying contrast, the area of the 
visual field that is useful for acquiring 
information during a brief glance, the ability 
to perceive relevant targets embedded within 
a complex scene, and the ability to judge 
distance and changes in distance tends to 
deteriorate with increasing age. 
  In this part, we can sum up that changes of 
visual perception may bring up a critical 
effect on driving, especially for older drivers. 
Therefore, as people getting older, they 
should be more concerned with the problems 
of visual ability with increasing age, and also 
make related changes while driving. 
Cognitive functions thought to be important 
to driving include decision making, selective 
attention, attention sharing, information 
processing, and each of the abilities 
investigated tends to degrade with increasing 
age (Llaneras et al., 1998). As a result, 
cognitive skill can be viewed as an important 
ability affecting the safety of elder drivers 
when driving. 
  Research (Eby & Kostyniuk, 1998) has 
pointed out that after 65 years of age, 
attentional abilities, processing speed, 
memory abilities, problem solving, and 
wayfinding ability begin to decline. Early 
research also shows that cognitive abilities 
may be especially important for the aging 
driver: a further study by Fell (1976) 
examining the human component in 
accidents has found that 60% of crashes 
involving elder drivers are due to 
‘informational’ causes such as failure to 
perceive the danger of a situation or failure to 
 6
groups. Although the crash rate of older 
drivers is lower than other drivers who hold 
driver’s license, the previous studies prove a 
viewpoint that they have a high fatal crash 
rate in accordance with the miles that they 
drive. 
  Based on the statistics of the total driving 
length and traffic flow of freeway from 1990 
to 2004, the amount is gradually increasing 
annually (National Police Agency, Ministry 
of the Interior [MOI], R.O.C., 2005). More 
specifically, the frequency of driving on 
freeways increases promptly. Therefore, the 
application of ATIS on freeway will bring 
travelers more well-timed information. In 
2004, the top three causes of A1 traffic 
crashes on freeways resulting in drivers die 
on the spot or die in 24 hours in Taiwan were 
“fail to keep safe distance while driving”, 
“unsafe driving” and “blasted tires” (National 
Police Agency, Ministry of the Interior 
[MOI], R.O.C., 2005).  
  The main factor as has been discussed, 
“fail to keep safe distance while driving”, is 
becoming more important to discuss. This is 
because while drivers carry out driving task, 
the aprosexia results in ignoring the 
condition of leading vehicle. As a result, the 
issue of how providing information to 
travelers through ATIS while driving on 
freeway should balance driving and 
secondary tasks (e.g., advanced traveler 
information systems, cell phone) to ensure 
good performance plays a critical role in this 
research.   
  Changes and limits of perceptual, 
cognitive, and psychomotor abilities of elder 
drivers who are 65 years of age or older were 
reviewed as I pointed out at the beginning. In 
the following section, the introduction of 
advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) 
was discussed. 
No one can or will deny the importance of 
our developments in electronic and 
communication technology for transportation 
over the past years allowed a means for 
bettering older drivers mobility by offering 
them with an additional compensation 
strategy for overcoming declining abilities. 
These technologies, called intelligent 
transportation systems (ITS), are intended to 
provide a variety of technological solutions 
to the growing surface transportation 
problems experienced by more and more 
cities.  
  One type of ITS technology particularly 
suited for maintaining older driver mobility, 
designing to provide the travelers with 
real-time information about traffic conditions 
and optimal route-planning is advanced 
traveler information systems (Eby & 
Kostyniuk, 1998). The papers in Adler and 
Blue (1998) have provided extensive 
discussions of the applications of ATIS. They 
have also pointed out that these systems are 
designed to assist travelers in making pre-trip 
and en route travel choice decisions to reduce 
congestion and are capable of more direct 
broadcast of information to users by 
incorporating one or more of the following.  
 
 And Liu (2001) has adopted four different 
subsystems of ATIS identified by Perez and 
Mast (1992) to provide actual information 
while keeping the drivers informed about 
traffic, vehicle, road, and roadside conditions. 
Following are descriptions of these 
subsystems. (1) In-vehicle routing and 
navigation systems (IRANS). IRANS, one 
subsystem of ATIS, provide drivers useful 
information about how to get from one site to 
another in a format of subsequence such as 
route guidance navigation. (1)In-vehicle 
motorist services information systems 
(IMSIS). IMSIS can provide drivers with 
commercial logotypes and signs for eating 
facilities, service stations and other signs 
presented inside the vehicle to the drivers to 
recreational areas, historical spots, hotels, 
and so on. (2) In-vehicle signing information 
systems (ISIS). ISIS can provide 
non-commercial routing, warning, regulatory 
and advisory information inside the vehicle 
to the drivers. These systems can also 
provide some information that is currently 
available on permanent signs on the 
roadways. (3) In-vehicle safety advisory and 
warning systems (IVSAWS). IVSAWS can 
provide warnings of unsafe conditions and 
situations on the vehicle or roadway ahead 
that could result in danger with the drivers. 
  However, based on the data of the top 
reasons of A1 traffic crashes on freeways in 
Taiwan mentioned before, we knew that the 
 8
communication device on driving 
performance and workload. 
Because of forbidding using a hand-held 
phone since 1999, the hands-free cell phone 
has been appeared in response to this trend of 
increasing limitations. Liu (2003) has pointed 
out that an “audio phone” or “auto-phone” 
has been combined with both the cell phone 
and the car stereo system. Then, when a call 
incoming, it is connected directly with the 
receiver and transmitter. Besides, under the 
circumstances with hands-free, driver’s voice 
can be absorbed by a microphone positioned 
in some convenient hands-up location. 
  Therefore, with more and more in-vehicle 
communication device usage during driving, 
it is of importance to find out if cell phone 
conversations in cars increase driver 
workload, and definitively decrease task 
performance. However, these activities of 
having conversations in cars may compete 
against limited driver mental resources. To 
date, it is already extensively accepted that 
using a handset cell phone while driving 
expressly increases the risk of accident. 
Hand-held phone conversations while driving 
increased the possibility of collisions. Many 
studies have also reported a decrement of 
various measures of driving performance 
(Chen et al., 2004). Following are 
descriptions of some of using hands-free 
phone conversations on driving performance 
and workload. 
  A research published by Chen and Lin 
(2003) compared driving situations with and 
without a secondary conversation with a 
hands-free cell phone using a driving 
simulator. Results showed that the use of a 
cell phone during driving could have adverse 
implications for driving safety. They 
revealed that drivers adopted several 
approaches to reduce additional cognitive 
workload caused by the phone conversation. 
Drivers compensated for a need to increased 
reaction time by increasing the headway 
distance to lead car and decreasing driving 
speed during the dual-task scenario involving 
driving and talking tasks. They observed an 
increase in missed brake responses, which 
seemed to be caused by a loss of attention to 
the driving environment in the dual-task 
situation and might have led to accidents. 
Furthermore, the dual-task driving tests 
indicated a loss of attention in subject 
processing of information presented on road 
signs.  
  Besides, according to another driving 
simulator study by Alm and Nilsson (1994), 
the effects of a mobile phone task on drivers’ 
reaction time, lane position, speed level, and 
workload were investigated in two driving 
conditions, including an easy or rather 
straight and a hard or very curvy route. This 
research was predicted that the mobile phone 
task would have a negative effect on drivers’ 
reaction time, lane position, and workload 
and result in a degradation of speed. It was 
also predicted that the effects would be 
stronger for the hard driving task. Subjects 
were randomly assigned to four experimental 
conditions containing telephone and easy or 
hard driving task and control and easy or 
hard driving task. Contrary to the predictions, 
results showed that the strongest effects were 
found when the subjects were exposed to the 
easy driving task. In the condition where 
drivers had to carry out the easy driving task, 
findings showed that a mobile telephone task 
had a negative effect on reaction time and led 
to a reduction of the speed level. Therefore, 
in the condition where drivers had to perform 
the hard driving task, findings showed that a 
mobile telephone task had an effect only on 
the drivers’ lateral position. Ultimately, the 
mobile phone task led to an increased 
workload for both the easy and the hard 
driving task. The results are discussed in 
terms of which subtask, car driving or 
telephone task, the subjects gave the highest 
priority. 
  In 1995 Alm and Nilsson also explored 
that the effects of a mobile telephone task on 
young and elderly when the drivers were 
driving in a car-following situation over the 
driving simulator. It was found that a mobile 
telephone task had a negative effect upon the 
drivers and the effect was more pronounced 
for the elderly drivers. The subjects’ mental 
workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX, 
increased as a function of the mobile 
telephone task. As a result, these outcomes 
show that the accident risk can increase when 
a driver is using the mobile telephone in a car 
following situation.  
 10
devices in cars has probably generated 
accidents. In addition, it is critical to 
understand the effects of advanced traveler 
information systems and cell phone use 
during driving on behavior and performance. 
In this section, we would confer the objective 
measure of driving performance and 
subjective workload ratings scale of driver 
behavior. As demonstrated by Institute 
Transportation of MOTC in Taiwan (2005), 
the construct of relationship between driver 
workload and distraction, and driving 
performance can be illustrated by the 
interaction of driver, vehicle, road, and 
environment. In the experiment, dependent 
variables were based on both objective and 
subjective measures assessing driving 
behavior and performance when performing 
primary task (control the vehicle and 
situation they meet). In addition, drivers may 
get excess workload and distraction during 
driving. Therefore, we might use secondary 
task (ATIS, cell phone conversation) 
evaluated by subjective workload scale rating, 
such as NASA-TLX. Further, find out the 
relationship between “driving performance” 
and “driver workload”, then determining if a 
driver is overloaded.  
  Selecting reaction variables in 
experimental designs is able to provide more 
valuable information to assess the validity of 
experiment and system. Further, according to 
experimental objectives and scenario 
descriptions, decide the items of variables 
containing people, vehicle, and road to 
evaluate driving performances. Therefore, 
the objective measure in this experiment 
obtained from the driving performances is 
time to collision (TTC). Based on section 2.2, 
we knew that a primary cause of traffic 
crashes on the freeways was “fail to keep 
safe distance while driving”. Because of the 
aprosexia, the following vehicle might 
collide with the lead vehicle. Hence, in order 
to avoid traffic collision, TTC mainly used to 
evaluate driving safety is an effective 
indicator (National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration [NHTSA], 2000).  
  TTC can be calculated through the 
following equation with denoting the 
speed of ith vehicle, Xi meaning the position 
of ith vehicle, li showing the length of ith 
vehicle and the i-1th vehicle is ahead of the ith 
vehicle. 
 
 TTC is the time that is left until a collision 
occurs if both vehicles continue on the same 
course and at the same speed. In addition, it 
is the time needed containing the distance 
between the lead and the following vehicle 
with the relative speed between the lead and 
the following vehicle. Hayward (1972) has 
first pointed out the idea, and then debated 
extensively in Hydén (1987). For calculation 
of TTC to be possible, the issues must be on 
collision course, but not necessarily in a 
car-following situation. Further, when TTC is 
used in performing car-following tasks, the 
speed of the following vehicle is higher than 
the speed of the lead vehicle. Svensson (1998) 
has demonstrated that TTC is an indicator for 
a traffic conflict and related to accident risk 
(smaller TTC values lead to higher accident 
risks). There are many different comments 
can be found through literature review. Thus, 
suggestions range of the TTC value as safety 
limit can be from 1.6s (Hayward, 1972) to 5s 
(Maretzke & Jacob, 1992). 
  Subjective measures are becoming 
gradually an essential way in system 
evaluations and have been used extensively 
to assess operator workload. As 
human-machine systems have become more 
complex and automated, assessments based 
on the operator’s performance have become 
prohibitively difficult, and the need to 
evaluate subjective mental workload has 
become important (Rubio et al., 2004).  
  The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) 
uses six dimensions revealed in Table 1 to 
evaluate mental workload: mental demand, 
physical demand, temporal demand, 
performance, effort, and frustration (Hart & 
Staveland, 1988). Rubio et al. (2004) have 
noted that TLX has been applied extensively 
in multitask contexts, such as in real and 
simulated flight tasks, in air combat and 
using remote-control vehicles to analyze the 
effects of instruction type and boredom 
proneness on tasks performance. Twenty-step 
bipolar scales are used to obtain ratings for 
these dimensions. A score from 0 to 100 
(assigned to the nearest point 5) is obtained 
 12
reality system and a driving simulator. 
 The participants for this study were 
selected from sixteen younger drivers whose 
age were lower than 30 years old, and 
sixteen elder drivers were in excess of 65 
years old in Taiwan. Several studies have 
already mentioned that there were 
significant differences in driving 
cognitive-motor abilities between younger 
(≤ 25 years old) and older (≥ 60 years old) 
age groups (Liu, 2001). However, due to the 
difference of getting a driver’s license in 
different countries, we expanded the years 
that drivers of young were below 30 years 
old. Then, half younger and half elder 
drivers were randomly assigned to a group 
required to use ATIS during driving. 
Therefore, the order of appearance of the 
four trials (two replicates under each ATIS 
by cell phone conditions) for each 
participant was randomized. The 
requirements of the participants were 
holding a valid driver’s license; Having 
driving experience; Passing a health 
examination consisting of both a formal 
vision test (with 20/40 near and far vision or 
better) and an informal hearing test 
(understanding normal speech in a moving 
vehicle); and None of each participant has 
the experience of driving simulator. The 
experiment used the fixed-base driving 
simulator. The validity of this driving 
simulator for evaluating human driving 
performance has been established in many 
studies (Institute Transportation, MOTC, 
R.O.C., 2005). In this study, the simulated 
vehicle cab mainly included a controlling 
computer, a monitoring computer, an 
overhead projector, and a screen. Thus, the 
standards of controlling and monitoring 
computer hardware devices were shown in 
Table 2. Therefore, virtual reality (VR) 
technology was also used in the experiment 
to make subjects feel like in the real 
situation during driving. Under the 
circumstance, participants could interact 
with the situation while driving without 
danger. Hence, the basic units of VR system 
were listed below: (1)Virtual world (made 
by 3Ds MAX);(2)Virtual reality software 
(made by EON Studio);(3) Virtual reality 
computer (monitoring devices and data 
processing system); (4)Input unit (simulated 
vehicle system); and Output unit (simulated 
vehicle system).

   After constructing the virtual reality of 
driving simulation, a researcher chose the 
scene used in this experiment and then 
entered the related data of subjects into the 
controlling computer. When a participant 
started the driving simulator, the scene was 
imported through EON Studio in the 
controlling computer. Later image signals 
were transmitted by a graphic card in the 
controlling computer and projected on a 
screen. Based on this experiment, driver’s 
behavior was recorded over the driving 
simulator into the controlling computer. The 
VB.NET of the controlling computer may 
transmit not only the signals of the scene, 
but  
 
also the data of an experiment into the MS 
SQL of the monitoring computer through the 
Internet. At the same time, the VB.NET of 
the monitoring computer read the data saved 
in the MS SQL, and then analyzed and 
operated the data and performance instantly. 
Finally, the useful data saved in the database 
was presented on the displaying screen, and 
was used and evaluated. The driving 
scenario was designed to be a two-lane 
freeway of one-way in this research, 
containing the central separation, shoulder, 
and roadwork. All objects in the virtual 
situation were modeled to scale and 
 14
in the lanes, to keep it in the middle of the 
inside lane, and to perform a following 
task with the lead car. To build up the 
measures of drivers’ behavior on operating 
both ATIS and in-vehicle communication 
device while the car was in motion, 
participants were required to carry out the 
tasks such as the following: (2)Driving 
task. All participants were required to 
complete the simulated driving route as 
usual and were asked to obey all traffic 
rules. They were also requested to make as 
few mistakes as possible. (2) 
Communication task. Participants were 
instructed to answer the phone in a natural 
and smooth state during driving. Therefore, 
each phone call had ten questions, and the 
content of each phone was not hard for 
them. (3) Announcement task. Participants 
were notified some information about the 
traffic congestion on the freeway and 
provided with traffic signs, and speed limit 
through ATIS. As was mentioned above, 
driving performance was coded by SQL 
server and subjective workload was scored 
by Microsoft Office Excel 2003. Therefore, 
SPSS 10.0 was used in analyzing data of 
the study. The statistics analysis methods 
in this study were introduced such as the 
following: (1) Descriptive Statistics 
Analysis. Examine the frequent 
distribution, mean, variation and 
percentage distribution of the variable, and 
get the difference of the subjects’ driving 
behavior.(2) Multivariate Analysis of 
Variance (MANOVA). 23 MANOVA is 
used to test the hypotheses to see if there is 
a significant main effect. In addition, it can 
also be found that there is an interaction 
effect appearing between two or three 
factors. In this study, it is used to explore 
the relationship on age, ATIS working, and 
conversation to see if there is a significant 
impact on drivers’ behavior. 
 
Results 
 
  The participants for this research were 
selected from different ages of drivers, 
younger and elder drivers in Taiwan. Table 
4 shows the age, gender and education of 
the subjects. Of the thirty-two subjects 
performed in the experiment, sixteen were 
over 65 years old, and the other sixteen 
were younger than 30 years old. The 
average age of the elder subjects is 69.31, 
with a standard deviation of 3.52, and their 
ages ranged from sixty-five to 
seventy-seven years. And the average age  
of the younger subjects is 25.44, with a 
standard deviation of 2.03. Their ages 
ranged from twenty-one to twenty-nine 
years. Hence, most of the elder subjects 
were in the age group of 65-69 (62%), and 
the remaining subjects were relatively 
distributed across 70-74 (25%), and 75-79 
(13%). Approximately 62% of the younger 
subjects were in the age group of 25-29. 
Most of elder subjects were males, which 
made up 87%, and a half (50%) of younger 
subjects was also males. Subjects get 
different levels of education, 10 (68%) of 
young are studying in or graduated from 
college, 6 (38%) from graduate school, 
only 2 (12%) of elder graduated from 
college, 6 (38%) from senior high school, 
and 8 (50%) from junior high school or 
primary school.

“No” and “Yes” ATIS levels are 
schematized in Figure 2. And the subjects 
with using ATIS reported that “Mental 
Demand” (with a mean score of 54.06) is 
more important than “Effort” (with a mean 
score of 48.13), and “Physical Demand” 
(with a mean score of 41.25). As for those 
without using ATIS, “Mental Demand” 
(with a mean score of 61.88) is also the most 
important, “Effort” (with a mean score of 
54.38) as the next, and “Temporal Demand” 
(with a mean score of 45) as the third. In 
contrast, subjects without using ATIS 
showed higher load than with it. Further, we 
did the multivariate test to check whether 
significance exists or not (Table 8). Results 
of test were revealed no significant effect 
for ATIS levels versus mental load ratings 
(F = 0.318, P = 0.921). Although there was 
no statistical significance on mental load 
ratings, subjects without using ATIS 
reported that they needed much more time 
to perform the simulated driving than with it. 
Despite with or without ATIS, driving might 
make great use of “Mental Demand” and 
“Effort” dimensions. Figure 3 also presents 
the mean scores of each dimension of 
NASA-TLX in a histogram. In general, 
subjects with conversation showed much 
more load than without it. Then, we did the 
multivariate test as well to check whether 
existing significance or not for the two 
groups with “Yes” and “No” conversation 
levels in Table 9. Results indicated that 
there was a significant difference (F = 5.220, 
P = 0.001). However, subjects with 
conversation also reported that they needed 
much attention to perform the simulated 
driving, especially on “Mental Demand” and 
“Effort” dimensions.

  As we indicated in section 3.7, 
MANOVA was used in this section to find 
out the factor’s main and interaction 
effects, and to discuss if there were any 
significant impacts on drivers’ behavior. 
This section tests if subjects of different 
factors had different values of dependent 
variables significantly. In part 4.4.1, the 
factors versus driving behavior were 
presented. Then, part 4.4.2 would show the 
conversation of different age versus 
driving behavior. We did 23 MANOVA 
with the three factors of ATIS, 
conversation and age, and each factor has 
two levels, “high” and “low”. The set of 
factors and dependent variables is as Table 
13.

As shown in the second row of Table 17, 
no conversation presented a positive 
significant effect of TTC, p = 0.004. On 
the contrary, conversation revealed a 
negative significant effect of TTC, p = 
0.004. Then, comparing the mean TTC of 
the two groups with “No” and “Yes” 
conversation level (“Low” level and 
“High” level), we found out that drivers 
with low level of conversation tended to 
have higher TTC (1.801s), and with high 
level of conversation tended to have lower 
TTC (1.293s). The comparison is shown as 
Table 18. Therefore, the conclusion of the 
analysis was that driving with conversation 
over hands-free cell phone might be even 
possible to collide (TTC < 1.6s). Although 
there were no statistically significant main 
effects of NASA-TLX, the scores of 
driving with conversation were more than 
driving without conversation. These results 
indicated that driving with conversation 
might have more mental load while 
performing tasks.

As also shown in the second row of 
Table 19, younger subjects presented a 
positive significant effect of TTC, p = 
0.000. On the other hand, elder subjects 
revealed a negative significant effect of 
TTC, p = 0.000. Subsequently, comparing 
the mean TTC of two groups with 
“Young” and “Elder” age level, we 
discovered that drivers of young tended to 
have higher TTC (1.926s), and drivers of 
elder tended to have lower TTC (1.168s). 
The comparison is presented as Table 20. 
Hence, the conclusion was that elder 
drivers might have more dangerous 
occurrence of collision than younger 
drivers (TTC < 1.6s).

We could also compare the mean TTC of 
the two groups with “No” and “Yes” 
conversation level (“Low” level and 
“High” level), discovering that drivers with 
no conversation tended to have higher TTC 
(1.597s), and those with conversation 
tended to have lower TTC (0.740s). The 
comparison is revealed as Table 24. While 
no significant effects of NASA-TLX, the 
scores of elder’ driving with conversation 
(with a mean score of 57.208) were a little 
higher than without conversation (with a 
mean score of 42.625). The result indicated 
that elder’ driving with conversation might 
feel more mental load while performing 
tasks. 
 
Conclusions  
   In the part of “driving exposure”, 
comparing to several researches by Carp 
(1988), Shope et al. (1998), and Eby and 
Kostyniuk (1998), elder drivers of this 
study drive more days a week than younger 
drivers. It could be foreseen that elder 
drivers in Taiwan might have a strong 
tendency to maintain not only their driving 
abilities, but also their mobility. Elder 
driving in Taiwan would be as popular as 
that in the United States. From the 
“accident” of this part, we know that elder 
subjects of the study could be more 
cautious with driving. However, the 
population of elder drivers in Taiwan 
would be more and more in the future. 
   The section of “drivers’ mental 
workload” shows that subjects of the study 
reported that the most important mental 
load dimension is “mental demand”, and 
the second one is “effort” during their 
driving. These results might be the same as 
the studies in Schlag (1993), Stutts et al. 
(1998), and Eby and Kostyniuk (1998). 
Perhaps it might because these two 
dimensions are more related to the driving 
abilities. Therefore, driving with phone 
conversation might make drivers’ 
self-performance poor, and feel that they 
had no time to perform driving and 
communication tasks simultaneously. 
   Discussing the relation between three 
factors, and subjective and objective 
measures of driving behavior, the analysis 
results showed that ATIS had no 
significant effects on mental workload 
ratings and time to collision. These 
findings, however, go against the theory. 
The research of Eby (1999) mentioned that 
drivers of all age using ATIS might 
slightly increase their feelings of driving 
safety. From the experiment, therefore, we 
found that drivers of elder might ignore the 
system display, and drove by their free will 
during their simulated driving. Perhaps it 
could because drivers in Taiwan may not 
get used to the system yet, and may not 
move larger viewing angles to read the 
system display with growing age. However, 
other reasons might be the form of ATIS or 
even the traffic flow because they were 
different from one to another country. In 
addition, driving task might occupy most 
of drivers’ limited mental resources, so that 
they tended to ignore other tasks to keep 
driving. 
 For the subjects of this study with phone 
conversation, the results showed that there 
was a significant effect on driving behavior, 
especially for elder subjects. Because of 
the declining driving abilities, elder drivers 
could be more possible to collide than 
younger drivers. These findings are in line 
with previous studies, although no 
 26
indicated that four subsystems were 
integrated into ATIS. Perhaps future 
research would consider a complete system 
of ATIS to see the impacts of ATIS on 
driving behavior. 
2. Considering the content of phone 
conversation. In this study, we used simple 
and easy communication to design the 
experiment. But from the literature review, 
some scholars indicated that simple or 
complex content of phone conversation 
might have different effects on driving 
behavior. Therefore, the study suggests 
that the content of phone conversation 
might be examined to the future study. 
3. Using more objective measures to 
evaluate the driving performance. Due to 
the limit of this study, we don’t have much 
time to increase other objective measures 
of driving performance. We are hopeful 
that future research would provide more 
detailed objective measures to assess 
driving performance. 
4. Extending to a great diversity of 
simulated driving condition. We take 
simulated driving condition as happening 
to a highway. Therefore, different driving 
condition would be happened in the real 
world. This study also suggests that 
designing a variety of simulated driving 
environment would be better for future 
study.
