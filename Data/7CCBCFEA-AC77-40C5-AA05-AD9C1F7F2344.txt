the amplitudes and time delays of these pulses, and recombining the coded pulses by a 
wavelength-multiplexing device [1]-[2]. These methods can be applied for optical digital 
modulation; however, it is difficult to apply them for multiplexing radio signals for analog links. 
The other kinds of method is to use spatial/frequency for 2-D OCDMA [3], however the number of 
star couplers use too many and it will induce power lose more seriously. 
In multi-wavelength schemes, it is essential to identify the maximum number of serviceable 
wavelengths since this number dictates the maximum permissible code length for coding purposes, 
i.e. the maximum number of simultaneous users which can be accommodated on the network.  
The system performance is essentially governed by the phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) [4], 
which comes from the beating between pulses of the same wavelength due to square law detection. 
The paper in [5] proposed codes with low in-phase cross correlation to alleviate this unavoidable 
effect. However, due to the lower code weight, the power loss is large and these codes get poor 
performance at low signal power.  
In this letter, the proposed 2-D OCDMA system using the prime codes as time-spreading code 
and Walsh-Hadamard codes as wavelength-hopping codes. The new 2-D scheme has been 
proposed by using the device of optical switch (OSW) and array-waveguide-grating (AWG) router. 
We use OSW to perform time-spreading [6] to suppress the noise of PIIN in multi-wavelength 
system. Optical wavelength/time coding scheme is used to demonstrate that the 2-D codes can be 
easily coded with compact hardware and the performance degradation due to noise of PIIN can be 
improved with the 2-D decoding architecture.  
 
2. System description  
Fig. 1. shows the diagram of the proposed 2-D OCDMA system using 2-D code. According 
to the transmitted signal, one broadband source performs to one port of the encoder by the intensity 
modulator that satisfies the time-spreading code by operating of OSW and spectral amplitude code 
by coding of AWG router to each transmitter. In order to gain the largest code length at the same 
 4
source directly, next sampled at an OSW, which is driven with a certain time-spreading code 
sequence Yk (for different time slots), whose frame period and chip width are TF (second) and TC, 
respectively, and the output signal of OSW is transmitted to a AWG router to realize spectral 
encoding with a spectral code Xk. Finally the wavelength/time code Ak,k is accomplished and sends 
to the star coupler. The entire time-spreading channel share the same frequency encoder and 
system complexity is reduced. The information bits of the user #(k, l) is ON–OFF shift keying the 
broadband optical sources to fulfill the E-O modulation The resulting signal will first be encoded 
in time domain, then spectral encoding will performed to fulfill the total 2-D encoding. 
If the ith chip of time codeword is “1”, the link between the intensity modulator and 
AWG-router will be ON and spectral codeword is transmitted. When the ith chip is “0”, the link 
will be “off” and this corresponds to the transmission of all-zero spectral chips. 
The AWG router-based decoders are shown in Fig. 3. The star coupler is connected to the 
decoder’s OSW driven with a pseudorandom (PN) unipolar code sequence such as optical 
orthogonal code (OOC) and pass to AWG router, which distributes received signals to the balanced 
photodetectors of each receiver decoder to realize differential decoding. 
There are four cases will happen in the receiver. One is the same wavelength-hopping pattern 
and the same time-spreading pattern; two is the same wavelength-hopping pattern and different 
time-spreading pattern; three is the different wavelength-hopping pattern and the same 
time-spreading pattern; and the other is different wavelength-hopping patterns and different 
time-spreading pattern. Case one is the desired signal in the system. In case two, it will cause MAI 
problem, but it is low compared with that of the desired signal component. In case three and four, 
the MAI problem can be cancelled in the proposed scheme.  
 
4. Performance analysis and discussion  
The performance of multi-wavelength OCDMA systems is mainly limited by PIIN effects [4], 
particularly when the received power is large. PIIN results from the beating of incoherent light

On employing BER= 0.5 ( / 8)erfc SNR , we can obtain the relation between bit-error rate 
(BER) and the number of simultaneous active users as a function of the length of prime codes 
(p=13, 31, and 47) and Walsh-Hadamard codes (N=16, 8, and 4), as shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen 
that the BER of the 2-D system degrades more significantly than that of the conventional 1-D SAC 
system when small simultaneous active users and short length of prime codes. This is because the 
noise of MAI becomes the dominant noise in 2-D system. When simultaneous active users become 
large, the effect of PIIN become much larger due to users transmits data with its wavelengths 
beating together during the direct detection of square-law photodiodes (PDs). By increasing the 
length of prime codes as spectrum spreading, we can get better performance. In other words, the 
2-D scheme exploits the fact that the input of less power into a PD simultaneously reduces the 
PIIN power, and hence reduces beating terms. Furthermore, in the proposed 2-D scheme, it is 
observed that the BER performance improves as the length of the prime codes increases.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This letter has proposed a 2-D OCDMA system with OSW and AWG router. The system is 
designed to increase the utilization of an optical broadband source with a finite bandwidth. In the 
proposed system, the number of encoder/decoder pairs and the required code length are more 
flexibility compared to a conventional 1-D OCDMA system. Furthermore, with the proposed 
system design, intensity modulators work with broadband light sources can be accomplished via 
one AWG router, thus mismatch between network coders can be avoided. The evaluation results 
have demonstrated that PIIN can be suppressed in theory by avoiding the wavelengths beating at 
the same time. The BER of the OCDMA system has been analyzed numerically for the PIIN and 
MAI limited case. MAI can be cancelled out by transmitting the data bits of the users from
