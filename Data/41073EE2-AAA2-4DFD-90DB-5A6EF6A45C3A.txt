Abstract—In this project, three predictive and dynamic sleep
time planning (PDSTP) energy-efficient mechanisms able to
simultaneously improve energy efficiency and packet delay for
IEEE 802.16e are designed. First of all, a prediction method
is proposed to estimate when a mobile station (MS) should
wake up because of the downlink packet arrival. With the
predicted time instant, an MS is then allowed to sleep as much
as possible using multiple maximum sleep intervals followed by
a smaller sleep interval before the predicted time instant. After
the predicted time instant, a few smaller sleep intervals with a
trend of constant level (CL), exponential decrease (ED), or linear
decrease (LD) can be further arranged for our three proposed
mechanisms, namely, PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD.
To react to the outlier of prediction, exponential increase for sleep
intervals can be extended. Via simulations, we show that PDSTP-
CL not only performs better than PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD
under general situations but also outperforms the standard sleep
mode operation of the type-I power saving class (PSC-I) in
IEEE 802.16e and the exponential sleep time backoff mechanism
(ESTBM) in the literature in terms of energy efficiency and
packet delay.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the past, the IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network
(WLAN) [7], [8] has been widely deployed to provide conve-
nient wireless access. However, its coverage is small because
of some restrictions, e.g., power limitation, caused by the
operation around 2.4 GHz of the industrial, scientific, and
medical (ISM) radio band [7], [8]. On the other hand, the need
of a high-speed mobile and wireless network is desirable as the
mobile communications and services go rapidly. Targeting at
offering a high-speed and reliable network with a wider service

area, the IEEE 802.16 wireless metropolitan area network
(WMAN) [9] was proposed in 2001 to fulfill the broadband
wireless access (BWA) system for fixed subscriber stations
(SSs). The IEEE 802.16 WMAN not only enlarges the service
area but also increases the number of SSs. Since only fixed
SSs are supported in IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.16e [10] was
proposed later for supporting MSs. To take care of mobility,
IEEE 802.16e further addresses the handover process and sleep
mode. Because batteries are main energy sources for MSs, how
to save energy/power to prolong the operational time becomes
an extremely important issue in IEEE 802.16e [24].
In the IEEE 802.16e WMAN, an MS does not always listen
to the base station (BS). It has awake and sleep operational
modes as shown in Fig. 1. An MS can transmit/receive data
in the awake mode, while the power of wireless interfaces is
temporarily switched off to save power when the MS is in the
sleep mode. There might be several sleep cycles in the sleep
mode. Each sleep cycle is formed by a listening window in
3with a trend of constant level) is employed, PDSTP-CL is
made accordingly. Of course, the sleep intervals can arranged
with a trend of exponential/linear decrease to form PDSTP-
ED/PDSTP-LD. To tackle the outlier of prediction, exponential
increase for sleep intervals can be further extended for PDSTP-
CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD.
The rest of this report is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the status of related work. In Section III, our proposed
mechanisms are depicted in detail. Section IV gives numerical
results with the corresponding detailed discussions. Finally,
Section V gives the self evaluation.
II. RELATED WORK
Let us now give the literature review on the status of
related work. Xiao [25] investigated the performance of the
sleep mode under different downlink packet arrival rates, while
both uplink and downlink packet arrivals were considered in
[27] by Xiao to get analytical performance metrics. In [5],
Han and Choi analyzed the sleep mode based on the semi-
Markov chain and proposed a suitable method to determine
the parameters of the sleep mode. Jang et al. [11] set different
sleep parameters for different traffic patterns. In [3], Cho and
Kim utilized the inter-packet arrival time of downlink packets
to adjust the minimum sleep interval, while the minimum
and maximum sleep intervals were adjusted based on both
uplink and downlink packet arrival rates by Xu et al. [28]. In
[13], Kim et al. proposed an algorithm to dynamically adjust
both minimum and maximum sleep intervals. Lee and Choi
[17] proposed a new power-saving mechanism based on the
probabilistic sleep interval decision algorithm by considering
the delay of response packets with performance evaluation.
Baker et al. [1] studied the relationship between energy
consumption and delay by using a mathematical approach.
Then, a scheduling method is newly proposed to adjust the
periods of sleep cycle. In [1], a small increment is added
to the next sleep cycle. Unlike our designs proposed in this
project, the adjustment on the sleep cycle proposed in [1] does
not consider the downlink packet arrival rate and the period
of sleep cycle still starts from the minimum sleep interval.
In [23], Vatsa et al. adjusted the minimum sleep interval
using the estimated inter-packet arrival time by the MS, while
Nga et al. [21] proposed a scheme called delay guaranteed
energy saving (DGES) to suitably determine the maximum
sleep interval based on the delay requirement by the MS.
In [20], Nejatian and Nayebi discussed the performance of
power saving using the non-Poisson process rather than the
Poisson process frequently employed by most related papers
in the literature. In [12], Jeong and Jeon proposed ESTBM,
which works similarly to the sleep mode of PSC-I in IEEE
802.16e except changing the initial sleep interval to half of the
previous sleep interval, to improve the sleep mode for IEEE
802.16e. Although ESTBM can save more power, it greatly
increases packet delays. As for the analytical performance of
ESTBM, Xiao et al. have thoroughly studied it in [26] by
using the embedded Markov chain. Later, Zhu and Wang [30]
enhanced ESTBM by using the number of downlink packets
to determine the initial sleep interval, while Zhu et al. [31]
further considered the requirement of delays when determining
the initial sleep interval. Different from the aforementioned
papers, Lee and Bahk [15] proposed a method to properly
determine the sleep interval based on the speed of the MS to
ensure that the MS will stay within the serving area of the BS
when the MS is in the sleep state to avoid disconnection with
the serving BS and searching for new BSs. In [16], Lee et al.
applied a scheme with multiple weighted decisive conditions
to determine whether an MS needs to wake up for receiving
packets or not.
III. DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED MECHANISMS
In this section, the three proposed PDSTP mechanisms for
improving the sleep mode of PSC-I in IEEE 802.16e are
described. PDSTP mechanisms utilize past downlink inter-
packet arrival times to predict the next inter-packet arrival
time with which the sleep time of an MS can be dynamically
planned so that the MS can use a shorter sleep interval
when the probability of having downlink packets is larger
and set a larger/maximum sleep interval otherwise. By doing
so, downlink packets are expected to be served quickly and
fewer listening windows and numbers of state transitions are
required, enabling the simultaneous improvement of the packet
delay and energy/power consumption. Moreover, a minifica-
tion factor is provided by these PDSTP mechanisms to allow
MSs flexibility to conveniently adjust performance according
to their requirements on the packet delay and energy/power
consumption. In the following, let us first elaborate on the
prediction of the downlink inter-packet arrival time.
A. Prediction of the Downlink Inter-Packet Arrival Time
In our PDSTP mechanisms, a simple and cost-effective
exponential smoothing technique (EST) [2] is employed to
predict the downlink inter-packet arrival time with consider-
ation of the minification factor γ1. Obviously, the proposed
prediction method is simple to implement. However, it not
ordinary since a minification factor γ is further incorporated to
make the proposed method flexible and adjustable. Noting that
the prediction/estimation error is inevitable, we need to prop-
erly plan the sleep time as described in Subsection 3.2 so that
the prediction error can be absorbed accordingly. Of course, a
more complicated prediction method can be further developed.
However, this may serve as another issue. Therefore, we
do not pursue this way in this project. Furthermore, the
mathematical analysis on estimation accuracy for the proposed
prediction method is almost intractable. Therefore, we will
not focus on this in this project. Rather than focusing on
the estimation accuracy, we pay our attention to the interplay
between the proposed prediction method and the dynamic
sleep time planning and the performance improvements as
compared to the related energy-efficient mechanisms. Finally,
1Assuming that the traffic model of downlink packets can be exactly
characterized, a more detailed traffic model considering more factors is
definitely better than a simple one. With such a traffic model, the probability
expected to have an arrival of downlink packets might not be related to the
length of the inter-packet arrival time only. However, such an assumption is
not posed in this project because a practical system is considered.

Fig. 3. The three proposed DSTP schemes.
enable us to plan the sleep time for MSs to be described in
the subsequent paragraphs.
For our DSTP schemes as shown in Fig. 3, three main
stages are set. In the first stage starting at the time instant
when the MS begins to enter the sleep mode (say t0) and
ending at the predicted time instant that the next downlink
packet will arrive (i.e., t0+Tˆ γn ), the probability expected to
have an arrival of downlink packets is low with the full
trust on the prediction, enabling the MS to sleep as much
as possible. Hence, the MS contiguously have Q sleep cycles
with the maximum sleep interval followed by one sleep cycle
with a sleep interval of length R. Note that the first stage
is a common stage to the three proposed DSTP schemes.
The second stage right follows the first stage. For this stage,
the interplay between the proposed DSTP schemes and the
prediction method is addressed. If the second stage is reached,
it means that no packet arrives during the first stage. Hence, a
higher probability is expected to have an arrival of downlink
packets within this stage since it starts at t0+Tˆ γn . As for when
the second stage ends, it depends on which of the following
three designs for the second stage is used: a constant level
(i.e., CL) for the sleep interval, a trend of exponential decrease
(i.e., ED) for the sleep interval, or a trend of linear decrease
(i.e., LD) for the sleep interval. Because of these designs,
the resultant DSTP schemes are then denoted by DSTP-CL,
DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD, respectively. For the second stage
of DSTP-CL (as shown in Fig. 3(a)), N (which is an integer)
sleep cycles with a sleep interval of length R is set. Here the
setting of N can rely on the accuracy of the estimation of the
downlink inter-packet arrival time. If the accuracy is high, the
choice of N is not so serious. However, it is expected to have
a bit larger value of N if the accuracy is not good enough so
that an arrival of downlink packets can occur within this stage
to possibly minimize the packet delay. As for the second stage
for DSTP-ED and DSTP-LD (as shown in Figs. 3(b)–(c)), a
decreasing trend of the sleep interval is set to further shorten
the packet delay until the minimum sleep interval is reached
because an arrival of downlink packets is highly expected
within this stage. Therefore, the sleep interval of each sleep
cycle in the second stage for DSTP-ED halves with respect to
the sleep interval of the previous cycle if the sleep interval of
the previous cycle is larger than 2Tmin, or it is set to Tmin and
let this stage end right after this sleep cycle. As for the sleep
interval of each sleep cycle in the second stage for DSTP-
LD, it linearly decreases using the step of δ with respect to
the sleep interval of the previous cycle if the sleep interval
of the previous cycle is larger than Tmin + δ, or it is set to
Tmin and let this stage end right after this sleep cycle like
DSTP-ED. If no downlink packet arrivals before the end of
the second stage caused by the outlier of prediction, the MS
will enter the third stage of the sleep mode (see Fig. 3). Due to
the outlier of prediction, the sleep interval for the third stage
adopts the exponential increase for the sleep interval like IEEE
802.16e. For DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD, the sleep
interval of each sleep cycle doubles with respect to the sleep
interval of the previous sleep cycle until the maximum sleep
interval is reached or exceeded and then it is fixed at Tmax.
More specifically, the series of the sleep intervals for DSTP-
CL could be
2R, 4R, . . . , 2kR, Tmax, Tmax, . . . ,
where 2kR < Tmax ≤ 2k+1R, and the series of the sleep
intervals for DSTP-ED and DSTP-LD could be
2Tmin, 4Tmin, . . . , Tmax, Tmax, . . . .
To ease the understanding of the three proposed DSTP
schemes, Fig. 4 illustrates the relationship between the sleep
interval and the sleep cycle for the standard sleep mode
operation of PSC-I in IEEE 802.16e, DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED,
and DSTP-LD.
The previous design only considers downlink packets. We
now further incorporate the consideration of uplink packets
which result in the interruption to the sleep mode, i.e., the

and send packets to the BS by using the time division duplex
(TDD) [28]. Based on the PMP topology, all communications
of MSs are directed to the BS and centrally coordinated
by the BS. Since our simulations focus on the comparison
of mechanisms for PSC-I in terms of the aforementioned
performance metrics, we shall pay attention to the connection
between an MS and the BS as shown in Fig. 5. In our
simulations, Poisson processes are used to model arrivals of
downlink and uplink packets. We observe the performance
metrics under various downlink packet arrival rates, while the
uplink packet arrival rate is fixed at 0.001 packet/ms. As for the
sleep mode parameters used, they are given in Table I. Shown
in Table II is the related power and energy consumption [19].
Let us now define the performance metrics used in sim-
ulations. i) Average packet delay is the average delay of a
downlink packet incurred caused by the sleep mode opera-
tion. Note that each packet delay can be measured from the
difference of the time instant that the MS waking up from
the sleep mode is ready to receive the downlink packet and
the time instant that the downlink packet arrives at the BS. ii)

Average energy wastage is the average energy consumption
of non-productive work [12] in listening and states switching
to receive a (downlink) packet. Here, the non-productive
work means that listening in the listening window and states
switching when no downlink packet arrivals. It is then clear
that the energy consumption in receiving (downlink) packets
when the MS wakes up is excluded from the average energy
wastage. iii) Sleep ratio Rsleep is the ratio of the total sleep
period (Tsleep) and the total working time (Ttotal) as defined
by (6).

Because we only investigate power saving of sleep modes
in this project, handover is not taken into account in our
simulations for simplicity. Fixing γ and N at 0.9 and 6,
respectively, with α varying among 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and
0.1 under 0.01 packet/ms downlink packet arrival rate, we have
Table III to show the impact on PDSTP-CL caused by different
values of α. From this table, one can see that α = 0.1 leads
to the best energy efficiency and sleep ratio but the longest
packet delay, while α = 0.08 can keep the same sleep ratio
and reduce the packet delay with a bit higher energy wastage
only. Therefore, α = 0.08 is set for the following simulations
under this observation.
B. Simulation Results and Discussions
Let us first examine the performance of PDSTP-CL when
different values are set to the corresponding parameters to
facilitate the choice of these parameters. Then, we compare
PDSTP-CL to PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD. Finally, the per-
formance of the standard sleep mode operation of PSC-I in
IEEE 802.16e (denoted by IEEE 802.16e for simplicity) and
ESTBM, respectively, is further incorporated and compared
with the best mechanism among PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and
PDSTP-LD (i.e., PDSTP-CL as shown later).
1) Determination of the parameters of PDSTP-CL: First,
let us investigate the impact caused by the minification factor
γ by fixing N at 10 and letting γ vary among 0.5, 0.8, 0.9,
0.95, and 1. Shown in Fig. 6 is the corresponding performance
metrics of PDSTP-CL. From Fig. 6(a), one can see that a
larger γ leads to a longer average packet delay except γ = 0.5
since the minification factor γ affects when the MS to start the
second stage in which small sleep intervals are set. Of course,
the smaller γ is, the earlier the MS starts the second stage,
resulting in reduction of packet delays because of more packets
in the second stage. However, more packets in the second stage
cause more listening windows and states switching before the
arrival of the downlink packet. This increases the average
energy wastage and reduces the sleep ratio accordingly as
shown in Figs. 6(b)–(c). The above observation says that a

Fig. 8. Performance comparison among PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and
PDSTP-LD.
Figs. 8(d)–(f), the three performance metrics for PDSTP-
CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD under the extremely low
downlink packet arrival rate ranging from 0.001 packet/ms
to 0.01 packet/ms are exhibited. With the same reasoning for
the interval [0.01, 0.1] (in packet.ms) of the downlink packet
arrival rate, PDSTP-CL still performs better than PDSTP-
ED and PDSTP-LD in terms of average energy wastage and
sleep ratio as shown in Figs. 8(e)–(f) and the percentages of
improvement in energy wastage can be further improved. As
for the average packet delay in Fig. 8(d), a crossing between
the curve of PDSTP-CL and the curve of PDSTP-ED occurs
approximately at 0.0032 packet/ms; a crossing between the
curve of PDSTP-CL and the curve of PDSTP-LD (δ = 10
ms) occurs approximately at 0.0044 packet/ms; a crossing
between the curve of PDSTP-CL and the curve of PDSTP-
LD (δ = 20 ms) occurs approximately at 0.003 packet/ms;
and a crossing between the curve of PDSTP-CL and the curve
of PDSTP-LD (δ = 30 ms) occurs approximately at 0.0025
packet/ms. It is evidently that better average packet delays
for PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD as compared to PDSTP-CL
when the downlink packet arrival rate is lower than the value
of the crossing can be obtained because most of packets for
PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD can be received when the MS
wakes up from the second stage of the sleep mode with a
shorter latest sleep interval than R. When the downlink packet
arrival rate is 0.001 packet/ms, the average packet delay of

extremely low downlink packet arrival rate.
higher gain is obtained for PDSTP-CL as shown in Fig. 10.
4) Performance comparison between PDSTP-CL and ES-
TBM: In Fig. 9, PDSTP-CL is compared to ESTBM, too. It
is clear from Fig. 9(c) that ESTBM can greatly improve the
sleep ratio as compared to PDSTP-CL since ESTBM gradually
decreases the sleep interval with an initial sleep interval of
half of the latest sleep interval when an MS needs to enter the
sleep mode after all packets are received in the awake mode to
maintain a much longer sleep interval for the MS in the sleep
mode. For the same reasoning, the average energy wastage as
shown in Fig. 9(b) can be well-improved by ESTBM as com-
pared to PDSTP-CL. However, much longer average packet
delays as shown in Fig. 9(a) occur for ESTBM as compared
to PDSTP-CL (or even IEEE 802.16e). Fixing the downlink
packet arrival rate at 0.01 packet/ms, the average packet delay
of PDSTP-CL is lower than half of the average packet delay
of ESTBM. As the downlink packet arrival rate increases, the
percentage of improvement in packet delay shrinks because the
initial sleep interval for ESTBM decreases as well to possibly
avoid longer packet delays incurred. The above observations
reflect the fact that ESTBM is more suitable for the delay-
tolerable network. Given a delay-tolerable network, PDSTP-
CL is actually applicable by choosing a larger value of γ
(> 1) so that the energy wastage and sleep ratio can be
kept at a satisfactory level as possible as the designer wishes.
In Fig. 11, γ is set to 1.03 for PDSTP-CL so that almost
comparable average packet delays for PDSTP-CL and ESTBM
can be reached. Since the initial sleep interval for ESTBM
decreases as the downlink packet arrival rate increases, the
dropping tendency of the packet delay is a bit steep than that
of PDSTP-CL with γ = 1.03 which lessens the number of
packets arriving in a smaller sleep interval as compared to
PDSTP-CL with a smaller γ, resulting in a bit longer packet
delays accordingly. This explains why a crossing occurs for
the curves of PDSTP-CL and ESTBM in Fig. 11(a). From
Figs. 11(b)–(c), one can see that PDSTP-CL can outperform
ESTBM in terms of average energy wastage and sleep ratio.
For the downlink packet arrival rate more than 0.05 packet/ms,
more than 36% of improvement in energy wastage and more
than 5% of improvement in sleep ratio for PDSTP-CL can be
reached as compared to ESTBM.
V. SELF EVALUATION
With the aid of the predicted downlink inter-packet arrival
time based on the exponential smoothing technique with
minification along with DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD
dynamic sleep planning schemes for MSs, three predictive
energy-efficient mechanisms, i.e., PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED,
and PDSTP-LD, designed for PSC-I of IEEE 802.16e are
proposed in this project. Setting a maximum sleep interval
when the probability of having packets is low enables the three
mechanisms to reduce the energy wastage caused by listening
and states switching. When the probability of having packets
becomes high, setting a smaller sleep interval is able to reduce
the possible packet delay for the three mechanisms. Although
the prediction error is inevitable, an extra consideration for
the outlier is included. Furthermore, uplink packet arrivals are

Abstract Three predictive and dynamic sleep time planning (PDSTP) energy-efficient mechanisms are proposed in
this paper to simultaneously improve energy efficiency and packet delay for IEEE 802.16e. To estimate the
time instant when a mobile station (MS) should wake up for receiving downlink packets, a prediction method
is designed. With the predicted time instant, an MS is then allowed to sleep as much as possible using multiple
maximum sleep intervals followed by a smaller sleep interval before the predicted time instant. After the
predicted time instant, a few smaller sleep intervals with a trend of constant level (CL), exponential decrease
(ED), or linear decrease (LD) can be further arranged. To react to the outlier of prediction, exponential increase
for sleep intervals can be extended. The combination of the aforementioned designs then forms our three
proposed mechanisms, namely, PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD. Via simulations, we show that
PDSTP-CL not only performs better than PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD under general situations but also
outperforms the standard sleep mode operation of the type-I power saving class (PSC-I) in IEEE 802.16e and
the exponential sleep time backoff mechanism (ESTBM) in the literature in terms of energy efficiency and
packet delay.

Fig. 1 Two operational modes for IEEE 802.16e
high-speed and reliable network with a wider service area, the IEEE 802.16 wireless metro-23
politan area network (WMAN) [3] was proposed in 2001 to fulfill the broadband wireless24
access (BWA) system for fixed subscriber stations (SSs). The IEEE 802.16 WMAN not only25
enlarges the service area but also accommodates more SSs. Since only fixed SSs are sup-26
ported in IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.16e [4] was proposed later for supporting MSs. To well27
take care of mobility, IEEE 802.16e further addresses the handover process and sleep mode.28
Due to the fact that batteries are main energy sources for MSs, how to save energy to prolong29
the operational time becomes an extremely important issue in IEEE 802.16e [5].30
In the IEEE 802.16e WMAN, an MS does not always listen to the base station (BS). As31
shown in Fig. 1, an MS has awake and sleep operational modes. An MS can transmit/receive32
data in the awake mode, while the power of wireless interfaces is temporarily switched off33
for saving power when the MS is in the sleep mode. In the sleep mode, there might be several34
sleep cycles. Each sleep cycle is formed by a listening window in which the MS can still35
receive data and a sleep period in which no transmissions and receptions are allowed [4].36
Note that the length of the listening window is quite short as compared to the length of the37
sleep period. For convenience, one usually associates the awake state and sleep state with38
the awake mode and sleep mode, respectively, to indicate the state of an MS.39
In IEEE 802.16e, there are three power saving classes defined for different types of connec-40
tion: PSC-I for the best effort (BE) and non-real-time variable rate (NRT-VR) with a variable41
length of the sleep period in a different sleep cycle, the type-II power saving class (PSC-II) for42
the unsolicited grant service (UGS) and real-time variable rate (RT-VR) with a fixed length of43
the sleep period, and the type-III power saving class (PSC-III) for management and multicast44
[6] with one sleep cycle only. To activate PSC-I, the MS sends MOB_SLP_REQ with related45
parameters, including the minimum sleep interval (Tmin) which is the shortest length of a46
sleep period etc., to the BS when all packets are completely served and awaits the response47
(denoted by MOB_SLP_RSP) from the BS. If a positive response is gotten, the MS then48
enters the sleep mode using the negotiated parameters. Note that the minimum sleep interval49
is used for the first sleep cycle. Once the MS enters the sleep mode, it switches its state from50
the awake state to the sleep state. After the sleep period, it changes its state to the listening51
state to receive the traffic indication message (TIM) to check whether there are packets for52
the MS in the buffer at the BS or not. If yes, the MS enters the awake mode to receive pack-53
ets. Otherwise, it starts the next sleep cycle and doubles the sleep interval (if the maximum54
sleep interval (Tmax ), which is the largest length of a sleep period, is reached, the length of55
the sleep period is kept at Tmax ). For PSC-II, exchange of messages MOB_SLP_REQ and56

prediction error is inevitable. Therefore, some extra actions are required once the estimated106
time instant is reached but no packet arrives (note that our previous arrangement works for107
the case in which a packet arrives earlier than expected). Once the estimated time instant is108
exceeded given that no packet arrives before that time instant, the possibility to have a packet109
arrival is extremely high. Therefore, a few smaller sleep intervals should be arranged further110
to avoid a longer packet delay. As for how to arrange these sleep intervals, the following111
three ways can be utilized. If the same sleep interval (i.e., the arrangement with a trend of112
constant level) is employed, PDSTP-CL is made accordingly. Of course, the sleep intervals113
can be arranged with a trend of exponential/linear decrease to form PDSTP-ED/PDSTP-LD.114
To tackle the outlier of prediction, exponential increase for sleep intervals can be further115
extended for PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD. As shown in Sect. 4, the time and116
space complexities posed by these algorithms/mechanisms are low (the form of polynomial,117
logarithm, or mixture of polynomial and logarithm) and acceptable.118
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the status of related work.119
In Sect. 3, our proposed mechanisms are depicted in detail. Section 4 analyzes the space and120
time complexities for the related mechanisms or algorithms. As for the numerical results121
with detailed discussions, one can refer to Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes this paper.122
2 Related Work123
Let us now give the literature review on the status of related work. In [23], Xiao investigated124
the performance of the sleep mode under different downlink packet arrival rates, while both125
uplink and downlink packet arrivals were considered in [25] by Xiao to get analytical perfor-126
mance metrics. Han and Choi [10] analyzed the sleep mode using the semi-Markov chain and127
proposed a suitable method to determine the parameters of the sleep mode. In [12], Jang et al.128
set different sleep parameters for different traffic patterns. In [9], Cho and Kim utilized the129
inter-packet arrival time of downlink packets to adjust the minimum sleep interval, while the130
minimum and maximum sleep intervals were adjusted according to both uplink and downlink131
packet arrival rates by Xu et al. [26]. Kim et al. [18] proposed an algorithm to dynamically132
adjust both minimum and maximum sleep intervals. Based on the probabilistic sleep interval133
decision algorithm by considering the delay of response packets, Lee and Choi [19] proposed134
a new power-saving mechanism with performance evaluation. Baker et al. [16] studied the135
relationship between energy consumption and delay through a mathematical approach. Then,136
a scheduling method is newly proposed to adjust the periods of sleep cycles. In [16], a small137
increment is added to the next sleep cycle. Unlike our designs proposed in this paper, the138
adjustment on the sleep cycle proposed in [16] does not consider the downlink packet arrival139
rate. Furthermore, the period of sleep cycle still starts from the minimum sleep interval.140
In [22], Vatsa et al. adjusted the minimum sleep interval using the estimated inter-packet141
arrival time by the MS, while Nga et al. [21] proposed a scheme called delay guaranteed142
energy saving (DGES) to suitably determine the maximum sleep interval based on the delay143
requirement set by the MS. In [20], Nejatian and Nayebi discussed the performance of power144
saving using the non-Poisson process rather than the Poisson process. In [17], Jeong and Jeon145
proposed ESTBM, which works similarly to the sleep mode of PSC-I in IEEE 802.16e except146
changing the initial sleep interval to half of the previous sleep interval, to improve the sleep147
mode for IEEE 802.16e. Although ESTBM can save more power, it greatly increases packet148
delays. As for the analytical performance of ESTBM, Xiao et al. have thoroughly studied it149
in [24] by using the embedded Markov chain. Later, Zhu and Wang [27] enhanced ESTBM150

the dynamic sleep time planning (DSTP) schemes to be described in the following allow MSs200
to enter the sleep mode using multiple maximum sleep intervals if the elapsed time is shorter201
than this value (in this case, the probability to have packets should be low) and using smaller202
sleep intervals if the elapsed time is greater than this value (in this case, the probability to203
have packets is expected to be high). Further noting that the predicted downlink inter-packet204
arrival time without minification is longer than the predicted downlink inter-packet arrival205
time with minification when γ < 1, DSTP schemes using the predicted downlink inter-packet206
arrival time with minification are able to allow MSs to use sleep intervals shorter than those207
employed by DSTP schemes using the predicted downlink inter-packet arrival time without208
minification to shorten packet delays. Moreover, minification when γ < 1 results in more209
packets with actual inter-packet arrival times longer than the predicted value as compared210
to the case without minification. This reduces packet delays and eliminates some possible211
drawbacks caused by the decision merely considering the moving average, such as excep-212
tion/outlier of packet arrivals. Obviously, the smaller γ is, the more reduction of packet delays213
can be gotten. On the contrary, the larger γ is, the better efficiency of power saving can be214
reached. Because of this tradeoff, 0.8 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is suggested for our DSTP schemes to well215
take care of both packet delay and energy consumption. Of course, one may choose a larger216
γ (or even γ > 1) for some special cases where efficiency of power saving is more important217
than reduction of packet delays. Hence, the minification factor γ is adjustable and depends218
on different performance requirements. Finally, one should note that the predication method219
here solely provides a reference time for the dynamic sleep time planning to be discussed220
later regardless of the prediction accuracy (in fact, its is hard to avoid the prediction error).221
To well plan the sleep time without causing a long packet delay, a short reference time is222
preferable. That is why a minification factor is included in our prediction method. Rather223
than pursuing towards an accurate prediction method which may require high complexity,224
only a simple EST-based prediction method is employed in this paper. It can be seen later,225
2 α may depend on application scenarios. Therefore, determination of α is also discussed in the section of
numerical examples and discussions. As for γ , it is up to the designer for different purposes.

not so serious. However, it is expected to have a bit larger value of N if the accuracy is not271
good enough so that an arrival of downlink packets can occur within this stage to possibly272
minimize the packet delay. As for the second stage for DSTP-ED and DSTP-LD (as shown273
in Fig. 2b, c), a decreasing trend of the sleep interval is set to further shorten the packet delay274
until the minimum sleep interval is reached because an arrival of downlink packets is highly275
expected within this stage. Therefore, the sleep interval of each sleep cycle in the second276
stage for DSTP-ED halves with respect to the sleep interval of the previous cycle if the sleep277
interval of the previous cycle is longer than 2Tmin , or it is set to Tmin and let this stage end278

at the BS has downlink packets destined to the MS when the MS wakes up from the sleep305
mode because of arrivals of uplink packets, it forms the first case. Since these downlink306
packets can be received by the MS during the awake mode as well after serving the uplink307
packets, the prediction of the downlink inter-packet arrival time can be updated accordingly308
for the MS and be used for the sleep planning later. If the buffer at the BS has no downlink309
packets destined to the MS when the MS wakes up from the sleep mode because of arrivals of310
uplink packets, it forms the second case. Since only an old predicted downlink inter-packet311
arrival time is available, the updated predicted downlink inter-packet arrival time is obtained312
by subtracting the shift time, which is a time period between the time instant performing313
the latest prediction and the time instant at which the last uplink packet arrives, from the314
old predicted downlink inter-packet arrival time. Of course, only a positive value is valid315
for the prediction and is expected for the above difference. If the difference is not positive316
because uplink packets arrive in the second or third stage, then the previous sleep interval317
(in the second or third stage) is directly set to the updated predicted downlink inter-packet318
arrival time to let the sleep planning directly skip the first stage and starts from the second319
stage. As for the procedure for dealing with arrivals of uplink packets called Uplink Packet320
Procedure (), it is given in the Appendix (see Algorithm 3). As for the pseudo codes for the321
three proposed DSTP schemes, i.e., DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD, one can refer to322
Algorithms 4–6 in the Appendix.323
Our proposed energy-efficient mechanisms, that is, predictive DSTP-CL (i.e., PDSTP-324
CL), predictive DSTP-ED (i.e., PDSTP-ED), and predictive DSTP-LD (i.e., PDSTP-LD),325
are then the combination of the prediction of the downlink inter-packet arrival time with326
minification and DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD, respectively. Since downlink packets327
may arrive during the sleep mode, an MS may not directly know when downlink packets328
arrive. Therefore, PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD ask the BS rather than the MS329
to execute the prediction of the downlink inter-packet arrival time. Certainly, the BS needs to330
continuously update the predicted downlink inter-packet arrival time with minification upon331
arrivals of downlink packets. Further noting that an MS in the IEEE 802.16e WMAN will332
necessarily connect to the BS when it starts up or when it needs to re-negotiate parameters, the333
parameters negotiation about α, γ , N (for PDSTP-CL only), and δ (for PDSTP-LD only) plus334
the other parameters specified in IEEE 802.16e for PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD335
are then additionally arranged in the necessary connection procedure between the MS and the336
BS. After the parameters negotiation, the BS is then able to predict the downlink inter-packet337
arrival time and passes it to the MS which is about to enter the sleep state via adding an extra338
field storing the value of the predicted downlink inter-packet arrival time with minification339
to the message MOB_SLP_RSP which is used to respond the message MOB_SLP_REQ340
previously sent by some MS that wants to enter the sleep state for PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED,341
and PDSTP-LD to inform the MS so that DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD schemes can342
be performed at the MS. With the aid of DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD schemes, the343
BS can easily determine when the MS needs to wake up, when the MS stays in the listening344
state, and when the MS stays in the sleep state. In the following algorithm, the pseudo codes345
for PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD are shown.346
Note that few modifications are required for the IEEE 802.16e WMAN when implement-347
ing the proposed mechanisms. Those simple extra modifications are definitely desirable when348
a specific network, i.e., IEEE 802.16e WMAN, gets involved. Avoiding unnecessary extra349
modifications for the IEEE 802.16e WMAN when implementing the proposed mechanisms350
serves as a major contribution for sure.351

5 Numerical Results and Discussions379
In this section, extensive simulations are done for different mechanisms, including the stan-380
dard sleep mode operation of PSC-I in IEEE 802.16e [4,10], ESTBM [17], PDSTP-CL,381
PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD. In the following, let us first describe the simulation arrange-382
ment and then discuss the simulation results in detail.383
5.1 Simulation Arrangement384
Our simulation programs are written in the C programming language and run on an IBM385
compatible personal computer (PC). In our simulations, the point to multipoint (PMP) topol-386
ogy is employed. Hence, an MS can receive packets from the BS and send packets to the BS387
by using the time division duplex (TDD) [26]. Since our simulations focus on the comparison388
of mechanisms for PSC-I, we shall pay attention to the connection between an MS and the389
BS as shown in Fig. 4. In our simulations, Poisson processes are used to model arrivals of390
downlink and uplink packets. We observe the performance metrics under various downlink391
packet arrival rates but a fixed uplink packet arrival rate of 0.001 packet/ms. As for the sleep392
mode parameters, they are given in Table 2. Shown in Table 3 is the related power or energy393
consumption [15].394
Let us now define the performance metrics used in simulations. (i) Average packet delay395
is the average delay of a downlink packet caused by the sleep mode operation. Note that each396
packet delay can be measured via the difference of the time instant that the MS is ready to397
receive the downlink packet and the time instant that the downlink packet arrives at the BS.398
(ii) Average energy wastage is the average energy consumption of non-productive work [17]399
in listening and states switching. Note that the energy consumption in receiving (downlink)400

5.2 Simulation Results and Discussions412
To facilitate the choice of these parameters, let us first examine the performance of PDSTP-413
CL under different values of parameters. Then, we compare PDSTP-CL with PDSTP-ED414
and PDSTP-LD. Finally, the performance of the standard sleep mode operation of PSC-I in415
IEEE 802.16e (denoted by IEEE 802.16e for simplicity) and ESTBM, respectively, is further416
incorporated and compared with the best mechanism among PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and417
PDSTP-LD (i.e., PDSTP-CL as shown later).418
5.2.1 Determination of the parameters of PDSTP-CL419
First, let us investigate the impact caused by the minification factor γ by fixing N at 10420
and letting γ vary among 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, and 1. Shown in Fig. 5 are the corresponding421
performance metrics of PDSTP-CL. From Fig. 5a, one can see that a larger γ leads to a422
longer average packet delay except γ = 0.5 because the minification factor γ affects when423
the MS starts the second stage. Of course, the smaller γ is, the earlier the MS starts the424
second stage, resulting in reduction of packet delays because of more packets in the sec-425
ond stage. However, more packets in the second stage cause more listening windows and426
states switching before the arrival of the downlink packet, resulting in the increase of the427
average energy wastage and the decrease of the sleep ratio accordingly as shown in Fig. 5b,428
c. The above observation says that a tradeoff exists between the packet delay and energy429
efficiency and it can be controlled by the minification factor γ . To improve the energy effi-430
ciency, one can choose a larger γ , while a smaller γ (but not too small, say γ = 0.5 in431
Fig. 5, since both packet delay and energy efficiency may not be improved because the third432
stage for PDSTP-CL may be involved to make the packet delay and energy efficiency get433
even worse) can be chosen to improve the packet delay. To achieve the balanced packet434
delay and energy efficiency for PDSTP-CL so that the simultaneous improvement of the435
packet delay and energy efficiency is viable, γ = 0.9 is suggested. Next, we continue436
to study the impact on the performance of PDSTP-CL caused by different choices of N437
(N = 1, 4, 6, 8, 12) which is the maximum number of sleep cycles in the second stage for438
PDSTP-CL when γ = 0.9. From Fig. 6, it is evident that a larger N might cause more439
packets to be associated with shorter sleep intervals, making the packet delay lower but440
the energy efficiency worse. For the purpose to get the simultaneous improvement of the441
packet delay and energy efficiency for PDSTP-CL, N = 6 is employed in the following442
simulations.443
5.2.2 Performance comparison among PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD444
Further investigating the performance of PDSTP-LD (with δ varying among 10, 20, and445
30 ms), and PDSTP-ED, Figs. 7 and 8 give the performance comparison among PDSTP-446
CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD. From Fig. 7a–c, one can see that PDSTP-CL outper-447
forms PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD in terms of average packet delay, average energy wast-448
age, and sleep ratio when the downlink packet arrival rate falls within the range [0.01, 0.1]449
(in packet/ms). The reasons are given as follows. First, more times of states switching are450
activated for PDSTP-ED and PDSTP-LD as compared to PDSTP-CL before a downlink451
packet arrival because of the decreasing sleep intervals in the second stage for PDSTP-ED452
and PDSTP-LD. This says that the average energy wastage (sleep ratio) of PDSTP-ED and453

novelty of sleep planning for PDSTP-CL. When the packet arrival rate is 0.01 packet/ms, 33%500
of improvement in packet delay and 38% of improvement in energy wastage are achieved501
by PDSTP-CL as compared to IEEE 802.16e as shown in Fig. 9. Of course, percentages502
of improvement in both packet delay and energy wastage shrink as the downlink packet503
arrival rate increases since the sleep planning is mainly designed for the low traffic load504
rather than the median or even the high traffic load for both mechanisms. To further elab-505
orate on the performance comparison between PDSTP-CL and IEEE 802.16e under the506
extremely low downlink packet arrival rate, one can refer to Fig. 10. One can see that507
more than 25% of improvement in packet delay can be reached when the downlink packet508
arrival rate falls within the range [0.005, 0.01] (in packet/ms). Note that percentages of509
improvement in packet delay decrease as the downlink packet arrival rate drops from 0.005510
to 0.001 packet/ms since the standard sleep mode operation of PSC-I in IEEE 802.16e works511
well when the downlink packet arrival rate is very low and the accuracy in the predic-512
tion of the downlink inter-packet arrival time for PDSTP-CL degrades for this case. As for513
the percentage of improvement in energy wastage, it gets better as the downlink packet514
arrival rate gets lower since much more sleep cycles are required for IEEE 802.16e as com-515
pared to PDSTP-CL. When the downlink packet arrival rate is fixed at 0.001 packet/ms,516
48% of improvement in energy wastage is achieved by PDSTP-CL as compared to IEEE517
802.16e even though the comparable packet delay is observed for PDSTP-CL and IEEE518
802.16e. Regarding the sleep ratio, a bit higher gain is obtained for PDSTP-CL as shown in519
Fig. 10.520
5.2.4 Performance comparison between PDSTP-CL and ESTBM521
In Fig. 9, PDSTP-CL is compared with ESTBM, too. From Fig. 9c, it is clear that EST-522
BM can greatly improve the sleep ratio as compared to PDSTP-CL since ESTBM gradually523
decreases the sleep interval with an initial sleep interval being half of the latest sleep inter-524
val when an MS needs to enter the sleep mode after all packets are received in the awake525
mode to maintain a much longer sleep interval for the MS in the sleep mode. For the same526
reasoning, the average energy wastage as shown in Fig. 9b can be well-improved by EST-527
BM as compared to PDSTP-CL. However, much longer average packet delays as shown528
in Fig. 9a occur for ESTBM as compared to PDSTP-CL (or even IEEE 802.16e). Fixing529
the downlink packet arrival rate at 0.01 packet/ms, the average packet delay of PDSTP-530
CL is lower than half of the average packet delay of ESTBM. As the downlink packet531
arrival rate increases, the percentage of improvement in packet delay shrinks because the532
initial sleep interval for ESTBM decreases as well to possibly avoid longer packet delays533
incurred. These observations reflect the fact that ESTBM is more suitable for the delay-534
tolerable network. Given a delay-tolerable network, PDSTP-CL is actually applicable by535
choosing a larger value of γ (> 1) so that the energy wastage and sleep ratio can be kept536
at a satisfactory level as possible as the designer wishes. In Fig. 11, γ is set to 1.03 for537
PDSTP-CL so that almost comparable average packet delays for PDSTP-CL and ESTBM538
can be reached. Since the initial sleep interval for ESTBM decreases as the downlink packet539
arrival rate increases, the droppi g tendency of the packet delay is a bit steeper than that540
of PDSTP-CL with γ = 1.03 which lessens the number of packets arriving in a smaller541
sleep interval as compared to PDSTP-CL with a smaller γ , resulting in a bit longer packet542
delays accordingly. This explains why a crossing occurs for the curves of PDSTP-CL and543
ESTBM in Fig. 11a. From Fig. 11b, c, one can see that PDSTP-CL can outperform EST-544
BM in terms of average energy wastage and sleep ratio. For the downlink packet arrival545

rate more than 0.05 packet/ms, more than 36% of improvement in energy wastage and more546
than 5% of improvement in sleep ratio for PDSTP-CL can be achieved as compared to547
ESTBM.548
6 Conclusions549
With the aid of the predicted downlink inter-packet arrival time based on the exponential550
smoothing technique with minification along with DSTP-CL, DSTP-ED, and DSTP-LD551
dynamic sleep planning schemes for MSs, three predictive energy-efficient mechanisms, i.e.,552
PDSTP-CL, PDSTP-ED, and PDSTP-LD, designed for PSC-I of IEEE 802.16e are proposed553
in this paper. Setting a maximum sleep interval when the probability to have packets is low554
enables the three mechanisms to reduce the energy wastage caused by listening and states555
switching. When the probability to have packets becomes high, setting a smaller sleep interval556
is able to reduce the possible packet delay for the three mechanisms. Although the prediction557
error is inevitable, an extra consideration for the outlier is included. Furthermore, uplink558
packet arrivals are taken into account to make the resultant mechanisms more complete.559
With the extensive numerical results from simulations, we demonstrate that PDSTP-CL sig-560
nificantly outperforms PDSTP-ED, PDSTP-LD, the standard sleep mode operation of PSC-I561
in IEEE 802.16e, and ESTBM in terms of average energy wastage, sleep ratio, and aver-562
age packet delay. Because of the capability to achieve the simultaneous improvement of563
the energy efficiency and packet delay and the flexibility offered by the minification factor,564
PDSTP-CL is highly recommended for use in the IEEE 802.16e WMAN.565

Abstract Achieving high accuracy with minimum reference nodes, anchor nodes, and
computation and communication costs is a goal for the localization in wireless sensor net-
works. Targeting at this goal, a localization scheme called concentric distributed localization
with the tripodal anchor structure and grid scan (CDL-TAGS) requiring two reference nodes
and a few anchor nodes is proposed in this paper. Under the precondition that the system has
randomly distributed normal sensor nodes, a tripodal anchor structure is first designed. With
this structure, the localization process is started from the centroid node and then stretched
outward to the farthest normal nodes. Based on the two best reference nodes, a virtual point
is generated to serve as the third reference node. In the CDL-TAGS scheme, a grid scan
algorithm is employed to estimate the position of a normal node. Finally, we show that the
communication overhead and time and space complexities among sensor nodes for CDL-
TAGS can be kept at a low level. In addition, CDL-TAGS can achieve better accuracy with
minimum anchor nodes as compared to some closely related localization schemes in the
literature through simulation results.

1 Introduction
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of sensor nodes in the area of interest for
sensing, processing, and transmitting a specific condition, e.g., vibration, temperature, etc.
One can now witness that WSNs have been applied to different fields, e.g., industrial process
monitoring and control, environment and habitat monitoring, etc. Usually, only a low-power
processor with small memory and a limited communication range is endowed with a sen-
sor node. Hence, sensor nodes need to collaborate with each other to perform a specific

Concentric Distributed Localization
requires a large number of anchor nodes as well. On the other hand, range-based systems
assume that each sensor node in the network is capable of measuring the distance to the
adjacent node. The range-based systems include anchor-based and anchor-free systems. An
anchor-based localization system assumes that there are certain anchor nodes in the network
with known locations. The approximate position can then be generated using the anchor node
position and the distance between adjacent normal nodes. Multilateration and trilateration
are the common methods in this category. The recursive position estimation (RPE) [1] and
the ad hoc localization system (AHLoS) [19] are two examples of the anchor-based method.
On the contrary, the anchor-free system has no need to assume that sensor nodes in the
network know their coordinates. Sensor nodes only use inter-node distance information to
localize the entire network. Therefore, it does not require an external infrastructure, such as
GPS or manual initialization. Consequently, it is hard to implement without anchor nodes as
reference nodes. The self-positioning algorithm (SPA) [6] is an example of the anchor-free
method. It requires more communication overheads to build the global network topology and
has low localization accuracy.
The contribution of this paper is to propose a concentric distributed localization scheme
for WSNs based on the tripodal anchor structure and grid scan, i.e., CDL-TAGS. The tripodal
anchor structure is formed by three anchor nodes symmetrically connected to a centroid node
under the precondition that the system has randomly distributed normal nodes. In our scheme,
the localization process is started from the centroid node and then stretched outward from the
nearest normal nodes to the farthest normal nodes. Each anchor node in the tripodal anchor
structure first obtains its position and disseminates it to the centroid node and its adjacent
nodes. The centroid node then calculates the center of gravity to estimate its position and
generates three virtual points for normal nodes under the boundary error condition (to be
explained later). When a normal node has collected information for at least two reference
nodes and the centroid node, it then generates a virtual point as the other reference node for
improving accuracy of localization. With the aid of the grid scan algorithm, the estimated
location of the normal node is set to the average location of the possible grids. By using the
aforementioned design, the communication overhead among sensor nodes in our scheme can
be kept at a low level. Compared to the schemes in [1,9], and [20], respectively (we shall
simply call them RPE, extended weighted centroid localization (EWCL), and Grid Scan,
respectively, in the following), our scheme requires a few (at least three) anchor nodes to
estimate positions of almost all normal nodes in the network with high accuracy. Like EWCL,
a normal node in our scheme can estimate its position using only two reference nodes. With
the aid of a virtual point serving as the third reference node, the position of the normal node
can be more predictable. Unlike RPE, the normal node in our scheme only uses reliable1
settled nodes (to be explained later) with low residual errors to serve as the reference nodes.
The other settled nodes with high residual errors are then prohibited to broadcast packets
to their adjacent nodes. Therefore, the communication overhead among sensor nodes in our
scheme is lower than that of RPE. Finally, our scheme uses a grid scan algorithm to minimize
the computation cost so that it is lower than that of RPE and is comparable to that of EWCL.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work on locali-
zation. In Sect. 3, we describe the problem and the main components of a localization system
for WSNs. Section 4 presents the proposed scheme. In Sect. 5, the complexities of CDL-
TAGS and the related localization systems are analyzed in terms of communication, time, and
space complexities. Section 6 gives the performance, experimental results, and comparisons
1 In this paper, such a security issue is not touched as claimed in Sect. 3. Therefore, how to rule out the
bad nodes attempting to propagate false information can form part of another issue deserved being further
addressed.

communication range of r . In the network, each sensor node has identical physical charac-
teristics and is capable of measuring the distance to its adjacent node. For any pair of sensor
nodes, they may directly communicate with each other if they are within the communication
range. As for the distance between a pair of sensor nodes, say, si and s j , denoted by d(si , s j ),
it can be obtained by the direct measure if d(si , s j ) ≤ r ; otherwise, d(si , s j ) may be obtained
indirectly.
Like [2] and [18], a WSN can be modeled by a graph where vertices represent sensor
nodes and edges represent distances between sensor nodes. In the WSN, sensor nodes are
classified into normal nodes, anchor nodes, settled nodes, and reference nodes. Normal nodes
are the nodes without their localization information, while anchor nodes know their locali-
zation information by manual measurement or an external device such as the GPS device.
As for settled nodes, they are defined as the normal nodes with estimated positions. Finally,
reference nodes are the nodes to be used by normal nodes to estimate their locations. Note
that the position of a reference node is not known as prior information. Instead, its position
should be properly acquired. Because the reference node may be an anchor node or a normal
node, two different ways are associated accordingly. For the anchor node, it is assumed to be
equipped with a GPS device to obtain its position or have a manual measurement to obtain its
position. As for the normal node, its own position is determined from the localization process
of our proposed scheme. For both cases, errors are inevitable. Therefore, the position of a
reference node is determined with errors in general. However, no error is assumed for the first
case in our simulations. Assuming that sets N , A, S, and R denote the sets of normal nodes,
anchor nodes, settled nodes, and reference nodes, respectively, the localization problem can
then be defined as follows:
Definition 2.1 (Localization problem): Given a multihop network G = (V, E) in R2 with a
set N , where N ⊂ V with d(si , s j ) ∈ E for all si , s j ∈ N , a localization problem is using
sets A and R to estimate positions and build S via transforming N to S as many as possible.
Frankly speaking, both immobile sensor nodes and mobile sensor nodes exist in both real
applications and papers in the literature. Both of them find possible applications and issues.
For example, mobile sensor nodes need more energy and this makes the energy problem
very hard to solve and requires a very high system deployment cost. For reasons like this,
the scheme to be proposed is mainly designed for a WSN with static sensor nodes (so do
EWCL, RPE, and Grid Scan) rather than mobile sensor nodes. Therefore, a static simulation
environment only will be carried out in the section of simulation results and discussions.
Finally, one should note that the security issue is not covered in this paper because it may
form an independent issue.
3.2 Main Components of a Localization System
As stated in [4], there are three main components for a localization system in a WSN, including
distance estimation, position computation, and localization algorithm. A good localization
system can then be optimally achieved by finding the best solution for each component. In
the following, let us briefly describe the three components.
3.2.1 Distance Estimation
This component is responsible for estimating the distance between a pair of sensor nodes
within the communication range. In the literature, the received signal strength indication

the tripodal anchor structure should set  as short as possible while being able to estimate
positions of sensor nodes. To apply this structure, the precondition is that the system has
randomly distributed normal nodes.
Our CDL-TAGS scheme has eight steps and is performed after all normal nodes and the tri-
podal anchor structure are deployed. The basic concept of CDL-TAGS lies in the localization
starting from the centroid node and then stretching outward as illustrated in Fig. 3b.
4.2 Details of CDL-TAGS
The pseudocode of CDL-TAGS shown in Fig. 4 mainly consists of eight steps, i.e., calculat-
ing the position of the centroid node and its virtual points, selecting reference nodes, getting
a virtual reference node, dividing the estimation rectangle into a grid matrix, grid scanning,
estimating the position, quantifying the residual error, and broadcasting. Now, these steps
are depicted as follows.

4.2.2 Selecting Reference Nodes
Each normal node needs at least two reference nodes and the information from the centroid
node to estimate its position. As for how to select a pair of sensor nodes when more than two
reference nodes exist, the two sensor nodes whose residual errors (see Fig. 5a) are lower than
the others will be selected because better estimation can be achieved. Here, the residual error
is defined as a measurement of confidence for the reference nodes (quantified in the seventh
step of the localization scheme). Because localization is started from the centroid node and
then stretched outward, the two reference nodes selected should be in the proximity of the
normal node and closer to the centroid node than the normal node. In Fig. 5b, how to detect
a pair of reference nodes in the proximity of the normal node and closer to the centroid node
than the normal node is roughly illustrated. First, the normal node calculates distances from
the two reference nodes, say, R f (the farther one) and Rn (the nearer one), to the centroid
node to make sure which one is closer to the centroid node. The normal node then finds the
intersection points between the circle centered at reference node R f with radius d f , where
d f is the estimated distance to reference node R f by the normal node, and the circle centered
at the centroid node C with radius l f , where l f is the distance between reference node R f
and the centroid node C . With the two intersection points, the normal node then calculates
the distances from reference node Rn to them to get two estimated distances dmin and dmax

4.2.3 Getting a Virtual Reference Node
Using two reference nodes may result in a large estimated area for the normal node. To
minimize it, an extra reference node is required. Based on the two reference nodes accepted
previously, the normal node generates a virtual point to serve as the third reference node (see

the normal node is inside any of them. As indicated in [25], the position of the normal node
is near the circular boundary of the reference node with smaller estimated distance to the
normal node. As shown in Fig. 6b, r2 < r1 implies that the position of normal node is near
the circular boundary of P2. Hence, triangle 
P1 P0 P3 can be selected for the estimation.
The triangle scanning in [24] can then be used to examine whether grid Ai, j is inside the
selected triangle or not. When two reference nodes have the same estimated distance to the
normal node i.e., r2 = r1, the triangle scanning can be ignored.
4.2.6 Estimating the Position
The coordinate of the normal node can be derived from grid Ai, j in the valid grid area where
the normal node may reside. Assume that there are m valid grids with the greatest grid value,
the position of the normal node is then estimated by 1
m
∑
valid i, j Ai, j .
4.2.7 Quantifying the Residual Error
Once the normal node estimates its position for being a settled node, it also checks the residual
error e via
e =
∑
l∈re f set
√
(xl − xˆ)2 + (yl − yˆ)2 − dl , (5)
where (xˆ, yˆ) is the estimated position of the normal node, (xl , yl) is the position of the lth ref-
erence node, re f set is the set containing the reference nodes, and dl is the distance acquired
by the RSSI measurement for the corresponding reference node. Note that the residual error
of a normal node is indeed influenced by the estimated distance, estimated position of that
normal node, and positions of the reference nodes possibly with additional biases. Because
of this fact, the policy to select reference nodes for our proposed scheme is to choose the best
pair of reference nodes with minimum residual errors as described in Sect. 4.2.2.
4.2.8 Broadcasting
Since the normal node only uses reliable settled nodes with low residual errors to serve as the
reference nodes, the other settled nodes with high residual errors do not need to broadcast
packets to their adjacent nodes. With the setting of an error threshold,2 the communication
overhead among sensor nodes can then be reduced.
5 Complexity Analysis
This section provides the complexity analysis of CDL-TAGS and the related localization
schemes in terms of communication, time, and space complexities.
5.1 Communication Complexity
In both CDL-TAGS and RPE, anchor nodes and the normal nodes able to estimate their
positions and broadcast packets to the normal nodes with unknown positions for serving as
2 The error threshold should be properly selected, in particular, in a sparse WSN (note that such a situation
seldom occurs in most of applications of WSNs).

while homogeneous sensor nodes are set for RPE and CDL-TAGS with the same communi-
cation range of 15 m. For all schemes, immobile normal nodes and anchor nodes are randomly
distributed in a region of 100 × 100 m2. Each sensor node is forced to stay in the active state
during the localization process. After the sensor node obtains its location, the sensor node
could enter the low-power mode for power efficiency. As for the other parameters, they are
described as follows. The RSSI error3 varies among 0.01–0.1%. The number of anchor nodes
for RPE and that for Grid Scan are set to 5 and 40%, respectively, of the normal nodes (the
number of normal nodes varies among 250–1000), while EWCL has 40 anchor nodes. For
CDL-TAGS, the number of anchor nodes varies among 3–60, the number of centroid nodes
varies among 1–20, and the arm length varies among 2–9 m. As for the error threshold of
CDL-TAGS, it is set to 1.5 m. Finally, the time that a normal node has to wait for more
packets from its neighbors is set to 1 s. The reason is stated as follows. We assume that a
normal node should receive the necessary broadcast information required by our proposed
scheme (see lines 14–18 of the pseudocode) from its neighbors being reference nodes within
this specified time period.
6.2 Performance Metrics
Two performance metrics are utilized to evaluate the performance of localization schemes
as follows.
6.2.1 Average Location Error e¯l
It is the average location error between the estimated position (xˆi , yˆi ) and the actual position
(xi , yi ) of all sensor nodes and is defined by
e¯l =
∑nn
i=1
√
(xˆi − xi )2 + (yˆi − yi )2
nn
. (6)
6.2.2 Ratio of Locatable Nodes Rl
It is the ratio of the number of locatable nodes nl and the total number of normal nodes nn ,
i.e.,
Rl = nl
nn
. (7)
6.3 Determination of Some Parameters for CDL-TAGS
Let us now investigate the performance of CDL-TAGS to get the best setting for the position
and arm length of the tripodal anchor structure.
6.3.1 Position of the Tripodal Anchor Structure
Considering four positions denoted by I, II, III, and IV as shown in Fig. 8, we examine the
impact caused by the placement of the tripodal anchor structure in Fig. 9. Shown in Fig. 9a
3 Actually, the variation of the received signal strength (RSS) can be captured by its variance etc. Similarly,
the variation of RSSI can be revealed by its variance, too. However, the RSSI error here denotes the maximum
variation in percentage caused by the variation of RSS (or the inaccuracy of the RSS measurement) associated
with the estimated distance according to the RSSI approach governed by (1).

6.4.1 One Tripodal Anchor Structure for CDL-TAGS
As shown in Fig. 11a, the comparison is given in terms of average location error. Explic-
itly, CDL-TAGS has the lowest average location error among the four schemes because of
its setting of an error threshold to throttle the number of settle nodes to participate in the
localization, while RPE has the highest one because it uses all reference nodes regardless
of residual errors. As far as the average location error is concerned, CDL-TAGS gains 22,
29, and 57% (38, 41, and 45%) of improvement as compared to EWCL, Grid Scan, and
RPE when the number of normal nodes is set to 250 (1000). In Fig. 11b, the comparison
is observed in terms of ratio of locatable nodes. From this figure, one can see that EWCL
estimates the positions of all normal nodes because the communication range of each anchor
node can cover the field. CDL-TAGS and RPE have a comparable ratio of locatable nodes

6.4.3 Comparisons with Varying RSSI Errors
Because Grid Scan is not a range-based localization scheme, we ignore it in this comparison.
The value of the RSSI error is increased sequentially from 0.01% (which means the estimated
distances is very accurate) to 0.1%. Figure 13a shows that increasing RSSI errors increases
the average location errors of CDL-TAGS and RPE for sure because of the RSSI-based fea-
ture, but it merely has a little impact on EWCL because of the weighted approach employed.
Note that the average location error of CDL-TAGS is better than that of RPE once the value of
RSSI error is beyond 0.033%. Actually, increasing RSSI errors also effects ratios of locatable
nodes for sure. As shown in Fig. 13b, the ratio of locatable nodes in CDL-TAGS and RPE
decreases when the RSSI error increases. However, the minimum ratio of locatable nodes
among the three schemes observed is still above 0.98.
Finally, the following remark discusses the limitations of CDL-TAGS.

nodes with time and space complexities lower than those of RPE. Compared to EWCL, Grid
Scan, and RPE, CDL-TAGS has better localization accuracy. With the setting of an error
threshold, the communication overhead among sensor nodes in CDL-TAGS can be reduced
and is lower than that of RPE. Because of the aforementioned advantages, CDL-TAGS is
highly recommended for use in the localization of WSNs.
Because our proposed scheme, i.e., CDL-TAGS, can not suit the WSN with mobile sensor
nodes, it needs much refinement and this deserves a new issue in the future.

To the best of our knowledge, no distance-based (DB)-related schemes have been proposed
for the cellular network with the ad hoc communication capability. To take the advantages of
the DB scheme and ad hoc communication, a DB location management scheme cooperated
with AANs, i.e., DBCAN, for the cellular network with the ad hoc communication capability
is proposed in this paper. It will be shown later that DBCAN is not trivially reached by simply
combining the DB scheme and ad hoc communication. In DBCAN, specific storage devices
put near cell boundaries and totally controlled by the system with security consideration
are added so that the location management cost can be reduced when the moving speed of
an mobile terminal (MT) is low. Because of the intrinsic nature of DB, the paging delay in
DBCAN can be properly controlled. To avoid the extra cost caused by using AANs, a method
to determine when to use AANs is further incorporated.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the literature review. In
Sect. 3, the details of the proposed location management scheme are described, including the
essential designs, how to determine when AANs should be used, location update strategy, and
paging strategy. Section 4 shows numerical results via the simulation approach and provides
detailed discussions. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes this paper.
2 Related Work
Generally speaking, there are two types of location management, i.e., static and dynamic
ones [2]. The static location management uses multiple fixed-size location areas (LAs) to
cover the system. Therefore, paging is basically confined to an LA. To avoid the ping-pong
effect, many researchers pay their attention to the dynamic location management in which
three well-known approaches, i.e., DB, time-based (TB), and movement-based (MB) ones,
are frequently utilized. The DB approach was proposed by Bar-Noy et al. [6]. With a pre-
defined distance threshold, a location update is performed if the distance from the current
cell, which the MT is staying, to the cell performing the latest location update exceeds this
threshold. Obviously, the scope of paging is then limited to a virtual circle centered at the cell
performing the latest location update with a radius of the distance threshold. As for the TB
approach, it was proposed by Rose [16] with the following working mechanism. Associating
a count-down timer with an MT, a location update is performed once the timer expires. In
[1], Akyildiz et al. proposed the MB approach by which an MT starts a counter recording the
number of moves among cells. Once a predefined movement threshold is reached, a location
update is performed. Based on the aforementioned three approaches, many other designs,
e.g., [11,14,18,19,25], were proposed accordingly in the literature. In [11], Masajedian and
Khoshbin combined the TB approach and the ad hoc network so that the mobility informa-
tion of a user can be stored in the device of the ad hoc network to reduce the paging cost.
In [14], Ng and Chan proposed an enhanced DB location management strategy to reduce
the location management signaling traffic via adjusting the size and shape of LAs according
to the moving speed and direction. Sricharan and Vaidehi [18] analyzed the mobility profile
of users to dynamically select a proper distance threshold for reducing the location update
cost, while Tung and Jamalipour [19] selected an optimal distance threshold according to
a transitional directivity index. In [25], Zhu and Leung derived a joint probability density
function of the number of cell boundary crossings and the number of location updates under
the MB approach to keep the number of location updates to a reasonable range via limiting
the movement threshold.
Different from the previous designs based on the aforementioned three approaches, other
designs, e.g., [5,7,10,12,13,15,17,20], were reported in the literature as well. Assouma

the mobility information of MTs are placed near the cell boundary. To get the information
stored at these designated nodes using the cellular network interface, it is necessary to per-
form the procedure of paging. For MTs of the cellular network, only the request of mobility
information saving is allowed and will be accepted by these AANs. As for how to implement
the functionality of these AANs, it can rely on one of the following two ways:
− When the next-generation, i.e., the fourth generation (4G), mobile network is realized,
an MT may have the ability to access the ad hoc network. Then, some specific MTs
with caches can be placed near the cell boundary, working like sensor nodes to store
mobility information of (normal) MTs. By using this way, power of these specific nodes
should be taken into account because the probability to successfully deliver the mobility
information is mainly contingent on this factor.
− A fixed ad hoc relaying station (ARS) placed near the cell boundary which works like
a small-scale base station (BS) with low complexity was proposed in [22]. An ARS is
able to receive both the broadcast messages from the BS and the messages via the ad
hoc communication. Such ARSs with caches can be utilized in this paper to act as the
aforementioned AANs in DBCAN. Since ARSs are fixed stations, the probability to
successfully deliver the mobility information can be maintained at a high level.
In the following discussion, the architecture of ARSs is assumed. As for how to place
ARSs, one can use signal strength to find points with equal signal strength from two BSs.
These points then form the cell boundary. Finally, choose a point with the strongest signal
strength to place an ARS as shown in Fig. 1 in which circular cells are assumed. Once the
placement of ARSs is done, an ARS can be searched by an MT crossing the cell boundary to
pass the target BS ID, which the MT is moving towards, for caching through the ad hoc com-
munication. When a call is to be established with a user (an MT), any ARS with the mobility
information of the user (MT) can respond to the cellular system to assist the procedure of
paging so that the number of cells to be paged can be significantly reduced.
Note that deploying AANs/ARSs causes the extra spending in deployment of the net-
work. In particular, a large number of AANs/ARSs are needed in a practical environment in
order to ensure that the cell boundary is completely (or highly) covered. Fortunately, such
an issue can be alleviated or solved for the 4G cellular network, e.g., long term evolution-
advanced (LTE-Advanced) [23], because the relay technique/station is defined and required
in the 4G cellular network for enhancing throughput. Therefore, the extra cost required to

3.2 Method to Determine When to Use AANs
One may notice that the extra cost caused by using the ad hoc communication increases
dramatically if the moving speed of the MT is quite high, resulting in a high frequency of
location update and old mobility information removal for ARSs. To avoid such a problem, a
method used to determine whether AANs should be used or not is designed for DBCAN as
follows.
3.2.1 Criterion
When a call initiates, the extra cost (per call) required for DBCAN Cadd , the paging cost
(per call) for DBCAN C p , and the paging cost (per call) for DB without using the ad hoc
communication C DBp need to be estimated. Only when (1) holds, the ad hoc communication
then gets involved when the MT crosses the cell boundary before the next call, or the ad hoc
communication should be avoided.
Cadd + C p < C DBp . (1)
(1) explicitly indicates that the sum of the estimated extra cost and paging cost for DBCAN
is still less than the estimated paging cost for DB without using the ad hoc communication.
Under this condition, location management assistance by the ad hoc communication will be
cost-effective.
3.2.2 Estimation of Cadd
One may note that possible extra costs for DBCAN include the cost to use the ad hoc com-
munication and the cost for the old information removal at ARSs when a location update is
performed. Furthermore, these two costs are pertinent to the number of location updates and
the number of cells crossed between two consecutive location updates. The aforementioned
description enables us to derive Cadd as follows:
Cadd = Nu(Nm(Ca + αCb) + Cu) + Nr Ca, (2)
where Nu is the estimated number of location updates, Ca denotes the cost to use the ad hoc
communication, Cb stands for the cost to inform ARSs by BSs for old mobility information
removal, Cu is the cost for carrying the extra information when performing a location update,
Nm indicates the estimated number of movements between two consecutive location updates,
and Nr represents the estimated number of the remaining movements after the last location
update. Note that 1) NmCa indicates the estimated extra cost for an MT to use the ad hoc
communication between two consecutive location updates; 2) Nr Ca denotes the estimated
extra cost for an MT to use the ad hoc communication after the last location update; 3) αNmCb
is the estimated extra cost required for informing ARSs by a BS to remove the old mobility
information when an MT performs a location update. Since the historic records of ARSs are
suitably aggregated in DBCAN to get a reduced minimum set of BSs to broadcast messages
to ARSs for mobility information removal, α then stands for a minification multiplier caused
by the aforementioned reduction effect. Noticing that an MT entering/leaving a cell will
ask an ARS to keep its mobility information, an BS can cover at least two ARSs, implying
α ≤ 0.5. In our numerical examples, α is set to 0.5 (i.e., the worst case is considered). One
can see that Nu can be figured out by
Nu =  NavgNm , (3)
123
Author's personal copy
H.-W. Ferng et al.
where Nˆi is the i th record of movements between two consecutive location updates, l is the
sample size (note that l = 0 indicates no record because of no location update). As for Nr ,
it can be calculated as follows:
Nr = Navg (mod Nm). (11)
3.2.3 Estimation of C p
C p can be calculated via
C p = Nr Ccp + Ccp, (12)
where Ccp is the cost to page a cell. Note that the cell-by-cell paging is used if the mobility
information can be got from an ARS. Of course, the mobility information delivery by an MT
to an ARS is not deterministic and should be associated with a probability. For simplicity, the
above derivations are done based on the probability of 1 to deliver the mobility information
by an MT to an ARS. Therefore, the lowest paging cost in DBCAN is got. Explicitly, Nr Ccp
represents the total cost to page all cells visited by an MT since its latest location update.
Further inclusion of the paging cost in the newest cell in which a location update is performed
then reaches the result of (12).
3.2.4 Estimation of C DBp
Next, C DBp is obtained via
C DBp =
d−1∑
i=0
(3i(i + 1) + 1)qi Ccp, (13)
where qi is the probability that an MT stays in ring i and
∑d−1
i=0 qi = 1, 3i(i + 1) + 1 is the
number of cells surrounded by ring i . Since qi depends on the mobility model, we cannot
assume a specific distribution for qi . Alternatively, an empirical distribution to be obtained
based on past records about frequency of staying in each ring is employed. Therefore, qi can
be expressed as
qi =
∑
b∈Bi
1
h
, (14)
where Bi is the record about times that an MT stays in ring i obtained when paging is
performed and h = ∑d−1i=0 |Bi |.
Note that the aforementioned calculation of costs may depend on some past records.
Hence, the ad hoc communication does not get involved initially in DBCAN until the positive
decision can be made when some past records have been collected. Otherwise, the ad hoc
communication still does not get involved in DBCAN. Finally, Fig. 2 shows the flowchart to
determine when to use AANs in DBCAN.
3.3 Location Update Strategy for DBCAN
Since DBCAN is designed on the basis of the DB scheme, a preset distance threshold is given
when an MT is in ring 0. When it moves into a new cell, it will examine whether the distance
from this cell to ring 0 exceeds the distance threshold or not. If yes, a location update is then

page the cell in which the latest location update was performed by that MT. If a response
is got from that MT, the call can then be established. If no response, any ARS located near
this cell boundary can respond by passing the mobility information of that MT to the system
if this ARS has this information. Therefore, the system is able to page a new cell according
to the mobility information got from the ARS, resulting in the cell-by-cell paging. Such a
procedure continues until no response from any ARS. After that, the cell-by-cell paging is
switched to the sequential paging. If any response from the ARS is got again, it is switched to
the cell-by-cell paging. Once the response from the MT is got, the whole paging procedure

4.1 Mobility Models and Simulation Arrangement
Let us first specify the cell arrangement for the cellular system. Generally speaking,
hexagonal cells are frequently employed in the literature to denote the service area of a
BS. Therefore, hexagonal cells are assumed in this paper, too. Since calculation of distance
D(Ci , C j ) between two cells Ci and C j is necessary for DBCAN, the coordinate system
given in Fig. 6 is rendered from [24] to enable the calculation of D(Ci , C j ) given as follows:
D(Ci , C j ) =
{
max(|Xi − X j |, |Yi − Y j |), if (Xi − X j )(Yi − Y j ) > 0,
|Xi − X j | + |Yi − Y j |, otherwise, (15)
where (Xi , Yi ) and (X j , Y j ) are coordinates of cells Ci and C j , respectively. Referring to
[21], the IID and directional mobility models based on the hexagonal cell are employed in this
paper. In these two mobility models, six moving directions, i.e., D0,…,D5, in Fig. 7 are pos-
sible with (D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) = ((1, 1), (0, 1), (−1, 0), (−1,−1), (0,−1), (1, 0)).
Denoting Dk and Ck to be the moving direction at the kth move and the coordinate reached
by the kth move with Ck = Ck−1 + Dk and letting γi, j denote the state transition proba-
bility from moving direction Di at the kth move to moving direction D j at the (k + 1)th
move, i.e., γi, j = P(Dk+1 = D j |Dk = Di ), the state transition matrix  is then given
by  = [γi, j ], i, j ∈ Z6, where Z6 = {0, 1, . . . , 5}. Shown in [21], the state transition
matrix can be simply constructed by the row vector γ0 = (γ0,0, γ0,1, γ0,2, γ0,3, γ0,4, γ0,5)

Mobility model IID, Directional
3 is used for the IID mobility model and 4 is employed by the directional mobility model
according to the observation in [19]. Varying the call to mobility ratio (CMR) from 1 to 10
or from 0.1 to 0.9, the location management cost, paging delay, and ratio of using the ad
hoc communication are observed under different moving speeds and mobility models. In
the following, let us further elaborate on the setting of different unit costs. In the literature,
many papers, e.g., [4,8,9], set the unit cost of location update Cup and the unit cost of paging
(paging a cell) Ccp to 10 (units) and 1 (unit), respectively. In this paper, we adhere to the
setting as well. As for the unit cost of putting some extra information Cu when performing a
location update, it is set to 1 (unit) since just a little information is required. About the unit
cost of using the ad hoc communication Ca , it should be lower than the unit cost of location
update and the unit cost of paging since the ad hoc communication works in the unlicensed
spectrum band, i.e., Ca < Ccp . Hence, Ca is set to 0.5 (units) in the following numerical
examples. As for the unit cost of clearing old mobility information by ARSs via a BS Cb, it is
set to 1 (unit) since it works analogously to paging. About the detailed simulation parameters,
one can refer to Table 4.
As for different costs, paging delay, and ratio of using the ad hoc communication, they
can be measured via the following equations based on the aforementioned unit costs:
T Cu = (Cup + Cu)T NuT Ncall + T Cb, (16)
T C p = CcpT NpT Ncall , (17)
T Ca = Ca T NaT Ncall , (18)
T Cb = CbT NbT Ncall , (19)
T C = T Cu + T C p + T Ca + T Cb, (20)
Dp = T NdT Ncall , (21)
Ra = T NaT Nm , (22)

model by varying the moving speed from the low speed (CMR = 10) to the median speed
(CMR = 1). From Fig. 8a, one can see that location update costs per call are low under such a
range of the moving speed because the distance threshold will be rarely exceeded by the MT.
Further comparing Fig. 8a with Fig. 8b reveals the following observations: i) The paging cost
per call for DB dominates and is much higher than those of the other two schemes for such a
range of the moving speed. ii) DBCAN/DBACAN can effectively reduce the paging cost per
call with the aid of the ad hoc communication since the distance threshold is rarely exceeded
by the MT under such a range of the moving speed. When CMR = 1 (the median moving
speed), around 60 % of improvement as compared to DB is observed for DBCAN/DBACAN.
iii) Since DBCAN/DBACAN needs to clean the old mobility information, a bit more location
update cost per call can be seen from Fig. 8a as compared to the location update cost per call
of DB. Of course, the cost of using the ad hoc communication per call for DBCAN/DBACAN
increases as the moving speed increases (from right to left) as shown in Fig. 8c. Concerning
the total cost per call, about 48 % of improvement can be reached by DBCAN/DBACAN as
compared to that of DB when CMR = 1 (the median moving speed) as shown in Fig. 9a.
About the paging delay per call shown in Fig. 9b, a trade-off between the paging delay per
call and the paging cost per call is observed for DBCAN/DBACAN since a mixed paging is
employed. Actually, the paging delay per call for DBCAN/DBACAN smoothly increases as
the moving speed increases and is a bit higher (6 % at most) than that of DB. As for the ratio
of using the ad hoc communication shown in Fig. 9c in which only the result of DBCAN
is given since the other two schemes have deterministic results (1 for DBACAN and 0 for
DB), almost 100 % is reached by DBCAN since it can benefit from using the ad hoc com-
munication under such a range of the moving speed, making DBCAN behave like DBACAN
(that is the reason why almost the same costs were observed previously for DBCAN and
DBACAN).
4.2.2 Performance Under the IID Mobility Model with CMR Ranging from 0.1 to 0.9
Varying the moving speed from the median speed (CMR = 0.9) to the high speed
(CMR = 0.1) for different schemes under the IID mobility model, the location update
cost per call, paging cost per call, and cost of using the ad hoc communication per call
are shown in Fig. 10 and the total cost per call, paging delay per call, and ratio of
using the ad hoc communication are shown in Fig. 11. Figures 10 and 11 reveal that
the performance metrics of DBCAN have a tendency to converge to those of DB as
the moving speed of the MT increases because the method to determine when to use

ad hoc communication per call, while the total cost per call, paging delay per call, and ratio
of using the ad hoc communication are shown in Fig. 13 for different schemes under the
directional mobility model with the moving speed ranging from the low speed (CMR = 10)
to the median speed (CMR = 1). By checking Fig. 12a, b, one can notice that DB under
the directional mobility model gets high location update costs per call and paging costs per
call than DB under the IID mobility model because of the directive nature of the directional
mobility model. As for DBCAN, the paging cost per call under the directional mobility model
can be improved much more than that under the IID mobility model. When CMR is 1, 73
% of improvement in the paging cost per call and 61 % of improvement in the total cost per
call (see Fig. 13a) can be observed. Moreover, less increment in the paging delay per call
for DBCAN (about 1 % at CMR = 1 as shown in Fig. 13b) under the directional mobility
model is observed than that under the IID mobility model because of better throttling effect
coming from the directive nature. Like the case under the IID mobility model, DBCAN can
benefit from using the ad hoc communication under the directional mobility model within
this range of the moving speed as well to reach 100 % (like DBACAN) ratio of using the ad
hoc communication (see Fig. 13c) and comparable costs of using the ad hoc communication
per call (as shown in Fig. 12c).

ena at a very high moving speed), the location update cost per call, paging cost per call, and

per call (see Fig. 14b) and 62 % of improvement in the total cost per call (see Fig. 15a) can
be obtained. When CMR decreases to 0.1 or smaller, the method to determine when to use
AANs can find that DBCAN cannot benefit from using the ad hoc communication any more
as exhibited by the ratio of using the ad hoc communication in Fig. 15c. From Fig. 15a,
one can notice that DBACAN gets high total costs per call at CMR of 0.05 because it still
employs the ad hoc communication. As far as the cost of using the ad hoc communication per
call (see Fig. 14c) under this range of the moving speed for the directional mobility model
is concerned, it becomes higher in general as compared to that under the same range of the
moving speed for the IID mobility model due to the strong directive nature reflected by the
high moving speed. As for the paging delay per call (see Fig. 15b), less increment in
the paging delay per call can be observed again under the directional mobility model because
of better throttling effect coming from the directive nature. When CMR 0.1 or smaller,
DBCAN behaves analogously to DB by using the same paging strategy, causing the paging
delay per call of DBCAN to approach that of DB, too. At CMR of 0.1, about 4 % at most of
increment in the paging delay per call is reported here.

compared to DB is investigated via a simulation approach. Our simulation results reveal the
following observations: i) Although the paging delay for the IID mobility model is higher
than that for the directional mobility model, the reduction of the location update cost (per
call) under the IID mobility model can still reach 48 %. ii) Of course, lower paging delay
and more reduction (61 % or so) of the location update cost under the directional mobility
model can be got. iii) The performance of DBCAN converges to that of DB when the moving
speed is high because the method to determine whether to use AANs or not can optimize the
cost. Note that 26 % of reduction in the total cost (per call) under the IID mobility model and
38 % of reduction in the total cost under the directional mobility model are still reachable
even if the probability to successfully deliver the mobility information to ARSs is only 0.5.
No doubt, the aforementioned observations explicitly exhibit the superiority of DBCAN and
provide an insight into the suitability of incorporating the ad hoc communication into the
location management of the cellular network.

comprehensive analytical model. However, there were only
a few attempts to create sophisticated but tractable ana-
lytical models for HCCA. For example, Traud et al. [10]
proposed an analytical voice over IP (VoIP) capacity
model to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11e. To the
best of our knowledge, the first analytical queueing model
to describe the HCCA mode was suggested by Rashid et al.
in [11]. Focusing on the presence of variable bit rate (VBR)
traffic, a time-limited PH/PH/1 queueing model with fixed
vacations equal to the HCCA service interval (SI) was
employed by the authors. However, the proposed model
still cannot be considered as universal even if the derived
results possess relative accuracy. The reason is that polling
time repetition intervals for the same station are rarely
constant since serving periods of other stations usually
differ from those pre-assigned by the scheduler, especially
with presence of VBR traffic. Such an assumption is not
practical at all and has less flexibility. Furthermore, [11]
assumed non-realistic infinite buffers. The aforementioned
reasons make [11] fail to fit the HCCA mode.
Considering the dynamic structure of HCCA, a novel
analytical model for HCCA based on the queueing system
is proposed in this paper. Since a cyclic-service system
with the time-limited policy controlled by transmission
opportunity (TXOP) periods fits HCCA, such a system
concept is employed in this paper. Unlike [12] which
considered the exponentially distributed time limits, the
generally distributed time limits are considered in this
paper. Further considering finite buffers, we develop our
own novel analytical model to describe the HCCA mode to
derive the average packet delay, number of packets at each
queue, system throughput, and packet loss probability. The
derived results make parameterized QoS performance
evaluation, impact investigation of system parameters on
the ability of QoS guarantee, and recommendations on how
to tune the HCCA system parameters to achieve the desired
QoS level feasible.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We define
the analytical model, discuss the assumptions, and get the
performance metrics of the model in Sect. 2. The analytical
results are then compared with the simulation results for
the purpose of model validation in Sect. 3. Afterwards, we
apply the proposed analytical model to investigate the
HCCA mode in detail and give insights into the system
operation in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes this paper.
2 Analytical model
First of all, let us make some necessary assumptions to
define a realistic but tractable analytical model. Looking
into the HCCA operational process defined in the simple
scheduler of the IEEE 802.11e standard [1] with the help of
Fig. 1, the system can be viewed as a single server, which
is the hybrid coordinator (HC), with multiple queues cor-
responding to QoS stations (QSTAs). This server polls
QSTAs in the order conformable to its polling list with a
repetition interval of the SI.2 Since the service time of a
QSTA queue is limited by its TXOP and a QSTA shall not
start transmission of a new packet if the remaining TXOP
is not long enough, the time-limited service discipline with
the non-preemptive service policy is associated with the
system. Explicitly, a cyclic-service system with the length
of a cycle equal to the SI well suits such a system. Here, the
HC visits the stations in the list one by one during an SI. At
the beginning of a new SI, the HC visits the stations
repeatedly. Note that the time interval to visit a station by
the HC within an SI varies for sure. This reflects the situ-
ation with VBR traffic when the actual TXOP time is
fluctuating and makes our model more flexible. Further-
more, we assume that TXOP periods3 are mutually inde-
pendent and generally distributed and packet service times
follow a general distribution. Here, the packet service time
includes the time to transfer one medium access control
(MAC) layer frame and the time to receive an acknowl-
edgment plus two short interframe spaces (SIFSs). As for

2 We assume here a fixed SI and no possibility for extra polling when
analyzing the simple scheduler of the IEEE 802.11e standard.
3 Here, we mean the scheduled TXOPs. Of course, it is absolutely
right to say that the length of TXOP length is fixed and depends on the
service (QoS) priority under the precondition that the simple
scheduler defined in the IEEE 802.11e standard is considered.
However, we try to allow our model to be general to describe a
variety of schedulers proposed for the IEEE 802.11e HCCA mode. In
the literature, some schedulers may employ traffic prediction schemes
and may change the length of TXOP every service interval according
to the traffic information.

at the completed instant of packet service for queue i is
equal to the number of packets at all queues present at the
starting instant of packet service for queue i plus the
number of packets arriving during the packet service
period, and minus one packet recently served at queue i. In

Similarly, we can obtain the following relation
x3;iðzÞ ¼ x4;i1ðzÞDci ðzÞ ð3Þ
by noting that the number of packets at all queues at the
starting instant when visiting queue i is equal to the number
of packets at all queues at the completed instant when
visiting queue i - 1 plus those packets arriving during the
changeover period. Finally, combining Eqs. (1–3) leads to
x2;iðzÞ ¼ cD

: ð4Þ
In the subsequent sections, c and x4;iðzÞ are further derived.
2.1.1 Derivation of c
First, let us determine a mean cycle time T which is the
mean time interval between two consecutive visits of the
same queue by the server. With the aid of [14], we have
T ¼
XM
i¼1
lCi
1  q : ð5Þ
Since the system with the virtual buffer policy is in
equilibrium in the long run, the packet arrival and service
rates should be identical. Therefore, the average number of
packets completely served during T is equal to
PM
i¼1 kiT .
Because each queue is visited by the server once in a cycle,
c is obtained as follows:
c ¼ 1PM
i¼1 kiT
: ð6Þ
2.1.2 Derivation of x4;iðzÞ
To find x4;iðzÞ, the time-limited service policy and the fact
of finite-buffer queues should be considered. Since the idea
on how to analyze the polling system with a limited service
policy has been previously introduced in [12], the method
of [12] is now applied to analyze our system by taking
some extra conditions into account. Let us introduce a set
of service limits Lif g, which are the maximum numbers of
packets the server can serve during each visit, limited by a
set of initial time periods of timers Hif g. Then, we can
define a set of service limit probabilities p ji
 
, where pi
j is
the probability that the service of queue i is terminated due
to the timer expiration after serving exactly j packets. By
definition, we have
p ji ¼ PðHi  X1i  . . .  Xj1i X ji ; Hi  X1i  . . .
 X ji \Xjþ1i Þ; ð7Þ
where Xi
k is a random variable representing the kth
packet service time at queue i. Note that fXki ðtÞ ¼
fXiðtÞ; k ¼ 1; 2; . . ., since X1i ; X2i ; . . . are i.i.d. random
variables. Furthermore, Hi and Xi
k, Vk, are independent
as well. In terms of the joint pdf, we then have

For the further discussion, let us focus on the instant when
queue i is in service with the corresponding service limit Li.
One needs to keep in mind the fact that the service of queue i
ends either if queue i becomes empty or the service limit Li
has been reached. To simplify expressions and derivations,
we consider the following modification to the system: the
server always serves exactly Li ‘‘packets’’ when visiting
queue i. To make the modified system work equivalently to
the original system, the following special treatment is
employed. If queue i becomes empty after serving j (j \ Li)
packets, the remaining Li - j ‘‘packets’’ served during this
visit are actually not real packets. Hence, ‘‘virtual’’ service
times are associated with these packets to let the system state
remain unchanged during the virtual service time.
For the modified system, let us introduce Yi;j ¼
ðYi;j1 ; Yi;j2 ; . . .; Yi;jM Þ as a random vector composed of num-
bers of packets at all queues right after j packet service
completions at queue i. Letting PYi;jðn2Þ be the probability
that Yi;j ¼ n2, its joint GF wi;jðzÞ can be obtained via

Given that j packets at queue i have been completely
served during the current visit and j \ Li, the next system
state, i.e., Yi;jþ1, depends on the current state and the events
coming during the service of packet j ? 1. If queue i
currently becomes empty, the special treatment is
employed; otherwise, the next system state is related to
the current state, the packets arriving during the service
time of the (j ? 1)th packet, and the packet served.
Defining Di ¼ ðDi1; . . .; DiMÞ as a random vector composed
of the numbers of packets arriving at all queues during the
service time of a packet at queue i, then the system state at
the (j ? 1)th service completion can be described as
follows: for j ¼ 0; . . .; Li  1, where li is a vector with

service and Yi is the random variable of queue length at queue

From Eq. (19), we then have
TiðsÞ ¼ Nið1  s=kiÞ: ð21Þ
Because the non-preemptive packet service discipline is
considered, the Laplace transform of the pdf of the packet
waiting time at queue i denoted by Wi(s) can be acquired as
follows:
WiðsÞ ¼ TiðsÞ=XiðsÞ ¼ Nið1  s=kiÞ=XiðsÞ; ð22Þ
where Xi(s) is the Laplace transform of the pdf of the
packet service time at queue i.
To obtain the packet dropping probability, we observe
the dropping probability of a randomly chosen probing
packet among packets arriving at queue i during the packet
service time of the packet currently being served. Let us
first define a conditional packet dropping probability.
Given that n2,i packets observed at the completed instant of
packet service have been waiting in queue, the conditional
packet dropping probability Biðn2;iÞ¼D P (the probing packet
is dropped |Y2,i = n2,i), where Y2,i is the length of queue i
observed at the completed instant of packet service. Note
that aiðmÞ ¼
R1
t¼0ððkitÞm=m!Þeki tfXiðtÞdt is the probability
of m packets arriving at queue i during a packet service
time. As far as these m packets are concerned, packet
dropping will occur if n2,i - 1 ? m [ Ki, where n2,i -
1 ? m - Ki packets will get dropped. Therefore, the
probability that a probing packet randomly chosen among
these m packets gets dropped is (n2,i - 1 ? m - Ki)/m.
Finally, Bi(n2,i) is obtained as follows:
Biðn2;iÞ ¼
X1
m¼Kin2;iþ2
n2;i  1 þ m  Ki
m
aiðmÞ: ð23Þ
Eliminating the condition yields the packet dropping
probability at queue i denoted by Pi
D, namely,
PDi ¼
X1
n2;i¼0
PðY2;i ¼ n2;iÞBiðn2;iÞ; ð24Þ
where P(Y2,i = n2,i) can be found from the coefficient of
z
n2;i
i in the expansion of Ni(zi). Finally, the average
throughput Si
NE at queue i can be calculated via
SNEi ¼ kið1  PDi Þ; ð25Þ
where the superscript NE indicates the assumption of no
packet errors.
Now, let us derive the pdf of the unused TXOP which is
the time left unused during the current TXOP because it is
not long enough to serve one more packet. For queue i, let
function fUijJðtjjÞ be the conditional pdf of the unused
TXOP Ui given j packets served exactly within Ui, where J
is a random variable indicating the number of packets
served within Ui. Note that Ui is the difference between Hi
and Sj =
P
m=1
j Xi
m. Since Hi and Sj are independent, fUijJðtjjÞ
can be expressed in terms of fHiðÞ and fSjðÞ as follows:
fUijJðtjjÞ ¼

where fSjðtÞ can be obtained through (j - 1)-fold
convolution of fXmðÞ; m ¼ 1; 2; . . .; j, because they are
independent. Considering the condition that the timer at
queue i expires after serving exactly j (j C 0) packets, we
have the pdf of the unused TXOP denoted by fUiðtÞ:
fUiðtÞ ¼

where P[Yi = 0] can be found from the coefficient of zi

the expansion of Ni(zi) (see Eq. (17)).
2.3.2 Frames from a QSTA to the QAP
The situation is easier to analyze since the QAP is not
entitled to send any data during a UL session. The TXOP is
granted to the QSTA by sending a QoS-Poll frame (with
piggybacked Data or not). Therefore, the probability that a
frame of length L to be successfully transferred in the UL
session Pul(L) is the probability to successfully send a
frame and receive an ACK frame without errors, i.e.,
PulðLÞ ¼ ½1  pðLÞ½1  pðLackÞ: ð35Þ
Now, let us derive the total throughput. Since each
QSTA works independently, we assume the probability
that a QSTA desires to start transmission is qQ. Then, the
number of active QSTAs n at any instant out of
the maximum QSTAs supported denoted by N follows
the binomial distribution, i.e.,
P½n active QSTAs ¼ N
n
 
qnQð1  qQÞNn
n ¼ 0; 1; . . .; N:
ð36Þ
Given n active QSTAs, the corresponding throughput as a
function of n for the uplink (UL) session denoted by Sul(n)
can be expressed as follows:
SulðnÞ ¼
Xn
v¼1
kvulLvPulðLvÞ=tcapul ; ð37Þ
where kul
v is the number of packets arriving at the queue of
QSTA v during one SI, Lv is the size of the MAC-layer
frame belonging to the traffic flow of QSTA v, and tul
cap is
the sum of all TXOPs with polling during one CAP. For the
simple scheduler, kul
v may be set to
gvSI
Lv
l m
for each QSTA,
where gv is the average data rate of the traffic flow of
QSTA v (see [1]). Hence, the mean throughput can be
expressed as
Sul ¼
XN
n¼1
SulðnÞP½n active QSTAs: ð38Þ
Similarly, the throughput for the downlink (DL) session
denoted by Sdl(n) given n active QSTAs is
SdlðnÞ ¼
Xn
v¼1
kvdlLvPdlðLvÞ=tcapdl ; ð39Þ
where kdl
v is the number of packets arriving at the queue of
the QAP during one SI for QSTA v and tdl
cap is the sum of
all TXOPs without polling during one CAP. Again, kdl
v for
the simple scheduler may be set to
gvSI
Lv
l m
for each QSTA
like the case of the UL session. Therefore, the mean
throughput for the DL session is
Sdl ¼
XN
n¼1
SdlðnÞP½n active QSTAs: ð40Þ
Based on these results, one can note that the TXOP allo-
cation algorithm (or the scheduling algorithm) plays an
important role in the channel utilization and the distribution
of CAP periods significantly affects throughput. In the
following section, let us validate our analytical model.
3 Model validation
In order to investigate the accuracy of our proposed ana-
lytical model, a number of tests done by the ns-2 [17] with
the HCCA mode patch [18] are arranged.
In our tests, an infrastructure-based system with one
QAP and a number of QSTAs based on the IEEE 802.11b
physical layer with the channel bandwidth of 11 Mbps are
taken into account. In the system, voice, video, and data
flows are assumed. Voice traffic is generated from 64 kbps
bidirectional VoIP traffic sources with a 160-byte payload
per 20 ms, while video traffic is taken from the real wire-
less traffic traces of 770 kbps MPEG4 video uploaded from
an online library [19] with packet sizes varying from 27 to
4,816 bytes and the average packet size of 1,378 bytes. As
for data flows, unidirectional FTP/TCP flows of 1,460-byte
packet size with the data rate of 120 KB/s are employed.
Using the above setting, the average times to send one
VoIP packet, one video packet, and one data packet are
360, 1,235, and 1,303 ls, respectively. Here, the simple
scheduler described in [1] is employed. For the analysis,
the packet size and inter-arrival time information along
with header sizes and the channel transmission rate are
used to get the corresponding packet service time and its
distribution. The data from the control frames sent to QAP
is used to set the SI length, while the TXOP distribution is
obtained via the definition of TXOP in the standard [1]. All

First, Fig. 7 investigates the impact caused by the
buffer size for a symmetric system, i.e., a system with all
equally loaded QSTAs. Figure 7(a) shows that the
average packet delay of the successfully delivered
packets is affected little by the buffer size. The average
packet delay keeps growing as the buffer size increases
until it reaches the average queue length for a particular
number of flows in the system. Obviously, more
enqueued packets wait for a longer time. Shown in
Fig. 7(b) is the packet dropping probability under dif-
ferent buffer sizes and system loads. Definitely, a high
system load causes a non-zero packet dropping proba-
bility and a larger buffer size has a lower packet drop-
ping probability. Figure 7(c) shows the error-free
aggregate channel throughput derived by Eq. (25) under
different system loads and various buffer sizes. Here,
two clearly distinguishable periods can be noted: the
period when throughput grows drastically with the
increase of the buffer size and that when throughput
grows very slowly or even does not grow anymore. The
first effect illustrates how well the buffer can accom-
modate the arriving packets. When the buffer size cannot
cope with the variation in the number of arriving packets
(around 10 packets), packets are dropped. With a larger
buffer size, it is easier to observe how the extra buffer
space copes with the reduced channel access caused by
increasing traffic. For a low number of flows (5–15
flows), the extra buffer space needed to cope with the
reduced channel access is minimal since the buffer
generally clears quickly. When the system gets closer to
saturation (20–25 flows), the reduced channel access
reduces the chances of clearing the buffer within each SI,
causing unsent packets in queue to grow much faster. In
this case, increasing the buffer space helps accommodate
the variation in the number of arrivals waiting for
channel access. This noticeably increases throughput.
When the system is in saturation (30 and more flows),
increasing the buffer space does not help so much any-
more because the buffer is always close to full regardless
of its size.

simple scheduler of HCCA is suitable for the constant bit
rate (CBR) traffic rather than the VBR one. With the
phenomena exhibited by the two figures, the following
observations can be made: (1) For HCCA with an unsat-
urated channel and shorter TXOP periods, more time will
be wasted. (2) The wastage will be enlarged further if
longer packets are generated. The later effect comes from
the polling nature of the HCCA mode because most of the
system time is spent in the HCCA control frames exchange
procedure under a low system load with presence of low bit
rate flows only.
The unused TXOP periods are presented by changeover
times in our model. The effect of the changeover time to
the waiting time of each station was discussed in some
research work, e.g., [21]. It was noted that the waiting
times of several systems with nonidentical constant
changeover times but identical sum of them and other
conditions are completely the same. Moreover, it was
stated that this property also holds in all the other cases,
even in infinite-buffer systems. As a result, it is concluded
that only the sum of the changeover times affects the
waiting time of each station for the system with constant
changeover times. Therefore, designers of schedulers
should pay attention to this fact to reduce the system
waiting times.
One may further ask how to reduce the sum of
changeover times to increase system utilization and to
possibly reduce waiting times. As mentioned previously,
the unused TXOP periods may appear as a result of a
shorter total transmission time of the current queue than
that was allowed by the TXOP or a longer total transmis-
sion time with the next packet being too large to be sent in
the rest of the current TXOP. The later case necessitates the
investigation of a system where the server still starts
service of a new packet even if the current TXOP is not
long enough. Consequently, we get the case when the
inter-queue-visit time becomes varying, which was actually
the problem of the PCF mode of the IEEE 802.11 standard
[3]. Although this allowance is not acceptable for CBR and
VBR traffic, the best effort traffic has no such limitations.
CBR traffic is more predictable and VBR traffic needs a
special treatment due to its burst nature. During the
scheduling phase, it then becomes reasonable to join CBR
flows into one group and mix VBR and best effort traffic
together. For VBR traffic, the exhaustive-limited service
policy should be employed to serve a packet even if the
TXOP period is not long enough. As for the best effort
traffic, the exhaustive-limited service policy with the cor-
rected limit should be associated and the service is stopped
exactly at the same time instant as scheduled initially. It is
expected that this tactics can increase the overall system
performance to achieve better utilization and lower waiting
times. To implement such an idea then forms a new issue
which deserves further study.
5 Conclusions
The novel analytical modeling on the HCCA mode based
on the cyclic-service system has been done in this paper.
With considerations of time relations between queues and
finite buffers, our presented analytical model is able to
show high accuracy reflected by comparisons with the
simulation models.
Using the proposed analytical model, the capability of
the HCCA mode is further investigated. We demonstrate
that HCCA can support parameterized QoS with more real-
time voice flows. However, the low traffic load leads to the
wastage of the system time and causes an extra packet
transfer delay. This shows that the HCCA mode is appli-
cable only at the high system load. Moreover, designers of
hardware modules should pay a special attention to prop-
erly choose the buffer size to keep the packet delay at a
lower level. Such a problem is discussed from different
angles by measuring the packet waiting time in queue and
packet transmission time. Definitely, the proposed analyt-
ical model is highly recommended to serve as a mathe-
matical solution to the choice of the buffer size to provide
insights into internal queueing processes of the system.
Finally, numerical evaluation shows that the system
under a heavily saturated condition reveals unfair behavior
if the system load is asymmetric. Moreover, the change-
over times are believed to affect the waiting time of each
station only through their sum. Of course, some sugges-
tions on how the performance of HCCA system may be
enhanced to achieve better system utilization are made in
this paper.

the network when the reported node is proven malicious.
Finally, selecting forwarding nodes near the crossing point
of the grid in our protocol enhances security by limiting the
number of nodes in the network getting involved in the routing
protocol. Working with the routing protocol, our security
design deﬁnitely ensures the capability of our protocol in
attack defense.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We describe
the network and threat models in Section II and present the
proposed energy-efﬁcient secure routing protocol in Section
III. In Section IV, the security analysis of the proposed proto-
col is investigated. As for numerical results and discussions,
they are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes
this paper.
II. NETWORK AND THREAT MODELS
Let us describe the network model ﬁrst. A wireless sensor
network with a stationary sink and stationary sensor nodes
is considered. Moreover, a localization discovery system [8]
is assumed to enable each sensor node to know its position
without utilizing a global positioning system (GPS). Finally,
sensor nodes are homogeneous and aware of their neighbors.
As for the data forwarding from the source node to the sink,
multi-hop forwarding is employed.
Next, the following threat model is assumed.
1) An adversary could compromise one or more nodes.
When a node is compromised, an adversary can obtain
all of the information kept in that node. The compro-
mised node then behaves in some malicious ways, e.g.,
to generate a fake message and to attack the network.
2) An adversary can interrupt the network by receiving
data from any sensor node or the sink. However, the
adversary has to own the appropriate key to disclose the
content of the message captured.
Because the sink has an unlimited amount of energy, it
becomes easier to protect the sink. Therefore, we assume that
the sink can be well-protected in the following discussion for
simplicity.
III. THE PROPOSED ENERGY-EFFICIENT SECURE
ROUTING PROTOCOL
We now describe our proposed secure routing protocol in
detail. In the following, the energy-efﬁcient routing protocol
is designed ﬁrst, then the security mechanism follows.
A. Design of the Energy-Efﬁcient Routing Protocol
Our routing protocol mainly includes the sink-oriented grid
construction and farthest-highest energy dissemination node
search, which are depicted in detail as follows.
1) Sink-oriented grid construction: The grid construction
for our routing protocol is done based on that of TTDD.
Assuming a two-dimensional area of interest, the grid is built
on the per-source basis with the size of a grid or a cell 𝛼×𝛼
(m2), where 𝛼 is equal to the half of the transmission range
𝑅. To construct grids, every node ﬁrst draws a virtual grid by
letting itself be one of corners of the grid. As for the other three
Fig. 1. A grid inside the transmission range of the source node (node 𝐴).
corners, they are called dissemination points. Given the source
location 𝐿𝑠 = (𝑥,𝑦), the locations of dissemination points 𝐿𝑝=
(𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑗) then satisfy:
𝑥𝑖 = 𝑥+ 𝑖𝛼, 𝑦𝑗 = 𝑦 + 𝑗𝛼,
where 𝑖 and 𝑗 are indices used to determine the direction of
the grid. In order to direct grids to the sink located at (𝑥𝑠, 𝑦𝑠),
the values of 𝑖 and 𝑗 should be properly selected by using the
following rules: if 𝑥 (𝑦) is greater than 𝑥𝑠 (𝑦𝑠), the value of
𝑖 (𝑗) is set to a negative integer; otherwise, the value of 𝑖
(𝑗) is set to a non-negative integer. Once the source builds
the grid as shown in Fig. 1, it records the positions of the
dissemination points. For each dissemination point, the source
needs to choose a dissemination node to be the alternative
for path forwarding by the source. To select a dissemination
node, the source ﬁrst sends an announcement message to all of
its neighbors by using simple geographic greedy forwarding.
The neighbors continue to forward this message until this
announcement message reaches a node falling within the circle
with radius of 𝛼/2 and the center at the dissemination point
and closest to the dissemination point. With the sink-oriented
grids, the delivery ratio of reports sent by source nodes can be
signiﬁcantly improved. However, a loop may occur because
of different directions of other grids. Since the direction of
the grid constructed by the source is determined according
to its direction to the sink, two or more grids may overlap.
As shown in Fig. 2, node 𝐴 might choose node 𝐵 as its
dissemination node, meanwhile node 𝐵 also chooses node
𝐴 as its dissemination node. For this case, a loop occurs.
To avoid loops, the mechanism to determine a dissemination
node should be slightly modiﬁed as follows. Before adding
a dissemination node, the source needs to check whether the
candidate of the dissemination node is one of its upstream
node. If yes, drop this node and consider the other neighbors.
2) Farthest-highest energy dissemination node search: In
our proposed energy-efﬁcient routing protocol, the mechanism
called farthest-highest energy dissemination node search is
also incorporated and described as follows. Once the source
determines its dissemination nodes, one or more alternative
paths to forward the data to the sink are possible. To prolong
the network lifetime, the path selection can be done with the
following considerations. First, the source node considers a
dissemination node associated with the farthest dissemination
point of the grid. We simply call such a node the farthest
dissemination node. Second, the source node considers the
106 2012 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)
mechanism, our protocol can defend against the unidirectional
link problem/attack.
2) Route request: After the neighbor discovery, every sen-
sor node knows the local topology but not the global topology
to communicate with the sink. To obtain the whole topology,
the sink needs to collect all of the local information from
each node. With this global topology, the sink can monitor
the network to avoid interference from adversaries. At the be-
ginning of the network deployment, the sink locally broadcasts
the route request (RREQ) message to its neighbors using the
following format:
𝑆𝐾 → 𝐴𝐿𝐿 : 𝑅𝑅𝐸𝑄∣∣𝑆𝐾∣∣𝐴𝐿𝐿∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝐺(∗)
∣∣𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝐾∣∣𝐸𝐾𝐺(𝑂𝐻𝐶0),
where 𝑅𝑅𝐸𝑄 is the message type, 𝑆𝐾 is the ID of the
sink, 𝐴𝐿𝐿 denotes all nodes, 𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝐺(∗) is the message
authentication code (MAC) of the part before the MAC se-
cured with the global key, and 𝐸𝐾𝐺(𝑂𝐻𝐶0) is the encrypted
initial one-way hash code (𝑂𝐻𝐶0) secured with the global
key. Note that the RREQ message initiated by the sink includes
𝑂𝐻𝐶0 that will be used later to generate the sequence number
to be included in every message in the data forwarding
phase. Each node in the network is initially pre-conﬁgured
a one-way function 𝐹 (.) to generate a sequence number 𝑆0,
𝑆1, . . . , 𝑆𝑛 such that 𝑆𝑖 = 𝐹 (𝑆𝑖+1), 0≤𝑖<𝑛. Since OHCs
function as sequence numbers of the message, inclusion of
OHCs is a lightweight defense against adversaries trying to
replay the same message in the network. This mechanism here
allows each node to authenticate that the OHC is originated
from the sink. Therefore, an adversary can not arbitrarily
forge the sink to send a fake 𝑂𝐻𝐶0 without knowing the
global key. A sensor node, say, node 𝑋 , receiving the RREQ
message directly from the sink rebroadcasts this message to
its neighbors with modiﬁcation shown as follows:
𝑋 → 𝐴𝐿𝐿 : 𝑅𝑅𝐸𝑄∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑋 ∣∣𝐴𝐿𝐿∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝐺(∗)
∣∣𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝐾∣∣𝐸𝐾𝐺(𝑂𝐻𝐶0),
where the position information of the sink is included to be
used in the secure grid construction to be described later.
Here, node 𝑋 replaces the sender ID of RREQ by its ID and
includes its MAC. Each node receiving the RREQ message
for the ﬁrst time validates the sender of this RREQ message,
records 𝑂𝐻𝐶0, and rebroadcasts the message to its neighbors.
When node 𝑌 receives this RREQ message, it checks the ID
of the sender (node 𝑋) and looks up if node 𝑋 is its veriﬁed
neighbor. If the sender is valid, node 𝑌 then calculates the
MAC to ensure that the message format before the MAC has
not been modiﬁed and records the value of 𝑂𝐻𝐶0. If node 𝑌
receives again the same RREQ message from the other nodes,
it only checks the validity of the sender without rebroadcasting
this message.
3) Secure grid construction: After receiving and rebroad-
casting the RREQ message, every node constructs sink-
oriented grids as explained previously. To securely construct
grids, the source node𝑋 then sends an announcement message
to its neighbors using the following format:
𝑋 → 𝐴𝐿𝐿 : 𝐴𝑁𝑁 ∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑋 ∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝐺(∗),
where 𝐴𝑁𝑁 is the message type of announcement. The neigh-
bor node 𝑌 of the source node 𝑋 replies the announcement
message with its position using the following format:
𝑌 → 𝑋 : 𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑁 ∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑌 ∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑋𝑁,𝑌 𝑁 (∗)∣∣𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑌 ,
where 𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑁 is the message type of announcement reply,
𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑋𝑁,𝑌 𝑁 (∗) is the MAC secured with the new shared
node key known by nodes 𝑌 and 𝑋 . After obtaining the
location information of all neighbors, the source node then
determines the dissemination node for every dissemination
point and informs each dissemination node of its the position.
The format of the conﬁrmation message from source node 𝑋
to a newly chosen dissemination node 𝑌 is shown as follows:
𝑋 → 𝑌 : 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝐹 ∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑋 ∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑋𝑁,𝑌 𝑁 (∗)∣∣𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑋 ,
where 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝐹 is the message type of conﬁrmation. Note that
the position of the source node can be used by the dissem-
ination point to ensure that the source node is trustworthy
through calculating the distance from itself to the source node
(it should not be greater than 𝛼( 1
2
+
√
2)). By implementing
this mechanism, the source node and the dissemination node
can make sure that both parties are sincere.
4) Route reply: To answer the RREQ message in the route
discovery phase initiated by the sink, a sensor node forwards
its neighbor information to the sink by sending the route reply
(RREP) message. After each node, say, node 𝑌 , receives the
RREQ message, it waits for a ﬁxed period of time and then
sends the RREP message to the sink via its dissemination node
𝑍 using the following format:
𝑌 → 𝑍 : 𝑅𝑅𝐸𝑃 ∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑌 ∣∣𝑆𝐾∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑌 𝑁,𝑍𝑁 (∗)
∣∣𝐸𝐾𝑆𝐾,𝑌 (𝑁𝐵𝑅𝑌 )
where 𝑅𝑅𝐸𝑃 is the message type of route reply,
𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑌 𝑁,𝑍𝑁 is the message authentication code secured
with the new shared node key known by nodes 𝑌 and 𝑍, and
𝐸𝐾𝑆𝐾,𝑌 (𝑁𝐵𝑅𝑌 ) is the encrypted neighbor information of
node 𝑌 with the shared primary key known only by the sink
and node 𝑌 since node 𝑌 includes IDs of all neighboring
nodes in the RREP message. The information of the suspected
node is also included with a speciﬁc mark so that the sink
knows that some node tries to join the network as the neighbor
of node 𝑌 but fails in the authentication by node 𝑌 . The
possible detailed neighbor information of node 𝑌 (𝑁𝐵𝑅𝑌 ) is:
𝐼𝐷𝑛1∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑛2∣∣ × 𝐼𝐷𝑛3∣∣ . . . ∣∣𝐼𝐷𝑛𝑘∣∣𝑀𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑆𝐾,𝑋(∗), where
𝐼𝐷𝑛1 to 𝐼𝐷𝑛𝑘 are the IDs of the neighbors of node 𝑌 .
The malicious node, e.g., ×𝐼𝐷𝑛3, has an extra mark ×. The
information is then used by the sink to inform the other nodes
to update their neighbor tables. In this way, every node can
participate in securing the network.
5) Routing update: After receiving neighbor tables from all
sensor nodes in the network, the sink may suspect one or more
sensor nodes to be malicious. There are several ways that the
108 2012 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS)
As mentioned previously, our proposed protocol requires
the pre-distribution of a set of three encryption keys. In
case an adversary captures a node, the adversary could get
the three types of key. Therefore, the node key shared by
two neighboring nodes should be updated. By updating the
node key, the adversary can only get the shared node key
between the captured node and its neighbors when it is
captured. In the following, the random node capture attack
is further considered since it is more threatening than the
aforementioned attacks. Now, let us investigate the security
strength under the random node capture attack.
We ﬁrst derive the percentage of cells affected by the ran-
dom node capture attack with respect to the data authenticity
given the number of compromised nodes. Regarding data
authenticity, a cell/grid is compromised if any of compromised
nodes can successfully send a bogus message to the sink.
On receiving a message, the node continues to forward the
message if only the node can recover the MAC of this message
secured by the secret node key shared between the receiver
and the sender. Using the random node capture attack, the
adversary can send a bogus message to the sink without being
dropped by capturing the source, or at least a dissemination
node. Assuming there are 𝑥 compromised nodes in a network,
𝑑 dissemination nodes, 𝑛 nodes in a cell, and 𝑁 nodes in
the network, the probability that a cell is compromised with
respect to the data authenticity denoted by 𝑃𝐴𝐶 is given by
𝑃𝐴𝐶 = 𝑃𝑆 +
𝑑∑
𝑖=1
𝑖
𝑑
𝑃𝐷,𝑖, (1)
where 𝑃𝑆 is the probability that the source is captured and
𝑃𝐷,𝑖 is the probability that 𝑖 dissemination nodes are captured.
The probability that an adversary captures the source is
𝑃𝑆 =
(
𝑁−1
𝑥−1

(

. (2)
The probability that an adversary captures exactly 𝑖 dissemi-
nation nodes is
𝑃𝐷,𝑖 =
(
𝑑
𝑖
)(
𝑁−𝑑−1
𝑥−𝑖
)
(
𝑁

Therefore, 𝑃𝐴𝐶 can be re-written as
𝑃𝐴𝐶 =

Next, we get the fraction of the network affected regarding
the data conﬁdentiality. In our proposed protocol, a message
is encrypted by the private key shared with the sink only. It
means that to obtain the content of a message, the adversary
has to capture the source. If there are 𝑥 compromised nodes
in the network and 𝑖 compromised nodes in a cell, then
the probability that a cell is compromised regarding the data
conﬁdentiality is given by
𝑃𝐶𝐶 = 𝑃𝑆 =
𝑥

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we present the simulation (analytical) re-
sults along with discussions for the proposed protocol and
TTDD (or LEDS). The simulation results focus on routing
performance. Therefore, the comparison between the proposed
protocol and TTDD is given. As for the analytical results,
the comparison on security analysis between the proposed
protocol and LEDS is carried.
A. Arrangement of Parameters
First, the simulation arrangement is detailed. The simulation
test-bed has one stationary sink and a number of stationary
sensor nodes. The transmission range of each sensor node is
set to 1200 m and the grid size 𝛼 is set to 600 m. Each control
packet contains 36 bytes and each data packet contains 500
bytes. To facilitate the comparison with TTDD, the free space
(fs) model in [6] is used with 𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐 = 50 (nJ/bit) and 𝜖𝑓𝑠 =
10 (pJ/bit/m2). To obtain the delivery ratio, TTDD and the
proposed protocol use the following parameter setting. The
number of nodes varies from 100 to 500 with an increment
of 50 and the network area is ﬁxed at 3000×3000 (m2).
The sink is located at (1500, 1500). To have the average
energy consumption and average hops, the following setting is
employed by TTDD and the proposed protocol. The number
of nodes varies from 300 to 600 nodes with an increment of
50 under the network area of 6000×6000 (m2) with a sink
at (6000, 6000). To get the lifetime, TTDD and the proposed
protocol set their parameters as follows: the number of nodes
is ﬁxed at 600. The amount of initial energy varies from 50 to
1000 (J). The network area is ﬁxed at 6000×6000 (m2) and
the sink is put to (6000, 6000).
Next, the parameters employed by the security analysis
are given as follows: 𝑁 = 170, 𝑛 = 10, and the number of
compromised nodes 𝑥 is set from 50 to 100.
B. Simulation Results on Routing Efﬁciency
1) Delivery ratio: The delivery ratios of the proposed
protocol and TTDD are reported in Fig. 4. From this ﬁgure,
we ﬁrst observe that the delivery ratios of both the pro-
posed protocol and TTDD are relatively steady as the density
increases. Next, the proposed protocol has higher delivery
ratios than TTDD because the proposed protocol dynamically

the report generated in an event cell when at least a node
in that cell is compromised, while in our proposed protocol
an adversary can obtain the content of the report only if it
can capture the source node out of nodes in a cell. Observed
from Fig. 8, the proposed protocol can achieve 17%-48% of
improvement in conﬁdentiality as compared to LEDS.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
An energy-efﬁcient secure routing protocol for WSNs with
a stationary sink is proposed in this paper. Using the location
information of the sink, the proposed routing protocol builds
the sink-oriented grids to ensure the path availability from
the source to the sink. Choosing the next hop dynamically
by taking the advantage of the node location and residual
energy information, an energy-efﬁcient path for data delivery
is selected. Based on the previously designed energy-efﬁcient
routing, the one-way hash chain, message authentication code,
and symmetric encryption are further incorporated into our
routing protocol to achieve secure data forwarding along the
path from the source nodes to the sink. With pre-shared secret
keys, every new joining node in the network is authenticated;
neighbor information is built by nodes and the global network
information is collected by the sink. Evaluating the routing
performance of our proposed protocol through simulations
and security analysis, we show that our protocol works in
an energy-efﬁcient manner and exhibits good robustness and
security strength under attacks as explained in Section V.
