Abstract 
Cooperative communications exploit the space or time diversity to improve quality of service 
(QoS) in wireless mobile networks by forwarding data from the source to the destination 
cooperatively. With cooperation between nodes, data are transmitted to avoid unsuitable routes 
with poor channel quality and to reduce signal loss, which increases the transmission rate, the 
channel capacity, and the signal coverage. Most previous works in cooperative networks 
concentrate on the issues in the physical layer. In this project, we address challenges and problems 
of cooperative communications in the medium access control (MAC) layer or higher layers to 
enhance the network performance. In this sub-project, we propose a cross layer design with the 
MIMO technique to enhance the network performance. 
Multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) technologies also play an important role in 
improving the performance of cooperative networks. The basic idea behind is to use the advantage 
of space diversity to enhance the usage of channel. But in the other side, it will also increase the 
interference between each node. In the subproject, “The Cross-layer Design of Cooperative 
Networks based on MIMO techniques”, we design a non-pilot-aided channel-length estimation 
scheme and propose a new MIMO-OFDM system built on such an adaptive prefix mechanism 
triggered by the feedback channel length information to greatly improve the throughput.

fundamental architecture design for the cross-layer MIMO network which is to build a new 
sequences generation for OFDM systems usage. The other one is to introduce a novel adaptive 
finite-impulse-response (FIR) equalizer-order selection scheme for multiple-input multiple-output 
(MIMO) channels. The model-order selection for blind FIR equalizers is determined heuristically 
but hardly on any theoretical basis. However, this heuristical strategy would often lead to a 
suboptimal solution. Thus, in this sub-project, we design a non-pilot-aided MIMO channel-length 
estimation scheme and propose a new blind-equalizer-order determination scheme built on such an 
adaptive channel-length estimation method. 
 
 Novel adaptive Blind-Equalizer-Order selection scheme for 
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Channels 
 
Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is one of the most promising techniques for achieving high 
data rate and reliability over the broadband wireless medium in recent years. Using the spatial 
diversity provided by multiple paths, MIMO technique significantly improve channel capacity. 
However, with the increasing data rate of wireless applications, fading and multipath propagation 
might introduce intersymbol interference (ISI) in addition to additive white Gaussian noise 
(AWGN). 
To deal with this crucial problem, we would like to introduce a novel equalizer order 
selection scheme based on channel estimation. A non-pilot-aided channel-length estimation 
algorithm [5] based on the second-order statistics of the received signals from the MIMO 
transceiver is employed to estimate the longest channel impulse response (CIR). Then, the 
resulting MIMO channel-length information is used to estimate the channel impulse response. A 
novel scheme based on theoretical analysis of 𝐿2 approximation error [6] is adopted to estimate 
length of blind equalizer consequently. With this novel equalizer choosing scheme, we can 
construct equalizer with optimal computational complexity and accuracy. Simulation results 
justify that our proposed order selection method greatly improve the system efficiency without 
sacrificing the equalizer’s estimating accuracy. Fig. 2 shows the architecture of OFDM systems. 
error upper bound. Consequently this order selection scheme provide an effective way for finding 
the minimum equalizer length with given truncation error, a tradeoff between computational 
complexity and error caused by equalizer’s truncation is obtained thereby. 
 
A. Non-Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation in MIMO system 
A blind channel impulse response estimation based on channel length estimation will be 
discussed. A novel channel length estimation algorithm has been studied in [5]. The Second 
order statistics for the received signal is used to estimated the channel length. We employ the 
estimated channel length to the iterative CIR estimation algorithm discussed in [7]. Without loss 
generality, we assume the MIMO channel to be linear-time-invariant(LTI) FIR filter with 
distinct length in the following. 
 
B. Novel Equalizer Order Selection Schema 
Based on the estimation described as above, we introduce a novel scheme for choosing 
equalizer’s order here. The theoretical analysis of the relationship between equalizer’s order and 
equalizer’s truncation error is presented in [6]. 
 
We propose a novel equalizer order selection scheme base on channel estimation and 
factorization. The novel scheme gives us a theoretical analysis for determining the length of 
equalizer given a truncation error. Consequently the system could be optimal both in computational 
complexity and accuracy. A simulation for tradeoff in transmission system with our novel order 
selection algorithm is present to support our claim. The architecture of this proposed model is 
illustrated in Fig.3 and Fig. 4. 
 
 Novel Sequence Design for Low-PMEPR and High-Code-Rate 
OFDM systems 
 
We propose a new family of 64-QAM based sequences for achieving the lowest PMEPR and 
the highest code rate compared to all other 64-QAM based schemes, which can be applied for 
OFDM systems. The construction of the proposed sequences is simple and the theoretical analysis is 
presented. 
 
As a matter of fact, Golay sequences are originated from multi-slit spectroscopy and they lead to 
many applications for ultrasonic or acoustic measurements. The mathematical properties of these 
64-QAM Golay sequences intrinsically imposed some restrictions and hence these sequences may 
not be optimal for the OFDM system design. 
 
This work attempts to address the concerns about both PMEPR and code rate emerging in OFDM 
 2. OUR PROPOSED NOVEL OFDM 64-QAM SEQUENCES 
To illustrate our proposed sequence construction method, we need to define some mathematical 
functions here. For any 𝑢, 𝑣,      , we define  (𝑢, 𝑣, ) as follows: 
 
  𝑢 𝑣    
 
√  
        
 
√  
        
 
√  
        
 
Note that the definition of the above 64-QAM constellation is the same as [8]. Nevertheless, how to 
choose the appropriate exponents 𝑢, 𝑣,  to form the 64-QAM sequences involves very different 
ideas. In this paper, we propose to use a combination of GCP and GS for determining 𝑢, 𝑣,  such 
that the PMEPR of the resulted 64-QAM sequence can be significantly reduced while the 
corresponding code rate can also be significantly increased. In this paper, we focus on the sequence 
length of   =    due to the availability of the GS construction method. The collection of our novel 
64-QAM sequences, denoted by 𝔾, is defined as follows: 
 
𝔾   〈 〉      𝑢  𝑣        〈𝑢〉 〈𝑣〉           〈 〉 𝑖        
 
We can derive the following theorem of the performance metric PMPER: 
The following theorem facilitates the upper bound of PEP for 𝔾 in above definition. 
Theorem 1: 
    𝔾     
 
  
√          
The detailed proof is described in the published paper. Please find the reference in our contribution 
list. 
 
In addition, the above table is the comparison between our proposed scheme and the previous 
related works. 
In this work, we propose a new family of OFDM 64-QAM sequences which achieve the lowest
