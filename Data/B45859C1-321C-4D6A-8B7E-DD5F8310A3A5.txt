INTRODUCTION 
Systematic investigations of the synthesis, characterization and applications 
of side chain liquid crystalline polymers began only after Ringsdorf1 and others 
proposed that a flexible spacer should be inserted between the polymeric main 
chain and the mesogenic side groups to decouple the motions of the main chain 
and side groups in the liquid crystalline state. Ringsdorf et al. developed the 
first side chain liquid crystal polymers in 1978. Since then, research in polymer 
liquid crystalline science and its technological applications has dramatically 
increased.2-7 
Cholesteric polymeric materials continue to warrant a great deal of attention, 
as their unique helical structures give rise to the selective reflection of incident 
light. The helical structure of cholesteric materials is induced by the presence 
of chiral components in nematic liquid crystals.8 A cholesteric structure is 
characterized by its handedness and pitch. Equal numbers of enantiomeric 
“guests” of equal enantiomeric purity induce helical structures with identical 
pitch and opposite handedness.9 The reflection of colors raised by the 
interference of light, due to the periodic molecular arrangement, is related to 
the helical pitch. The helical pitch is very sensitive to the influence of external 
conditions. Cholesteric liquid crystals have found applications in twisted 
nematic displays, medical thermography and imaging, linear and non-linear 
optics, sensors, and in novel electro- and magneto-optic devices and 
detectors.10 The helical structure shows constructive interference effects that 
lead to spectrally selective light reflections.11 Using this property, cholesteric 
liquid crystals have been used as media for optical data recording and storage12 
and for photonic band gap (PBG) materials for display technology, 
telecommunications and fiber optics.13 Different substances show different 
capacities for twisting a nematic phase. The ability of a chiral dopant to induce 
helical pitch is quantitatively defined as helical twisting power, β. The helical 
twisting power of chiral compounds can be defined as the slope of the plot of 
1/p versus the concentration of the chiral compound.14-16 In theory, many 
factors could influence the pitch of the cholesteric liquid crystals, for example 
the molecular chirality, the chemical structure of the chiral moiety, and the 
molecular interaction between host and guest molecules, among others. 
Recently there has been much development in the utilization of this property 
of cholesteric liquid crystals in the field of information technology, mainly in 
reflective displays, reflective polarizers, diffuse reflectors, and optical filters.17 
Tamaoki et al. showed that cholesteric liquid crystals can be used to develop 
full color rewritable recording devices that could operate in the thermal and 
photon modes.18 
Marcelis et al. investigated the influence of the linking group between the 
spacer and mesogenic core on the alternating properties of dimer liquid 
crystals.19 It was found that the phase behaviors of the cholesterol-containing 
dimer liquid crystals with ether and ester linkages are very similar, showing

The measurements were performed using 1 % solutions of substances in 
chloroform. Elemental analyses were carried out on a Heraeus CHN-O 
(Darmstadt, Germany) rapid elemental analyzer. Gel permeation 
chromatography (GPC) measurements were carried out at 40 oC on a Hitachi 
L-4200 (Osaka, Japan) instrument equipped with TSK gel GMH and G2000H 
columns.  CHCl3 was used as an eluent in these columns, and the rate of 
elution was 1.0 mlmin-1.  The instrument was calibrated with a polystyrene 
standard. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted with a Perkin 
Elmer DSC 7 at a heating and cooling rate of 10 Kmin-1 under a nitrogen 
atmosphere. The phase transitions were investigated with an Olympus BH-2 
polarized light microscope (POM) equipped with Mettler hot stage FP-82, and 
the temperature scanning rate was determined to be 10 Kmin-1. Thermal 
decomposition temperature data were recorded under a nitrogen atmosphere at 
a heating rate of 20 Kmin-1 with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) Perkin 
Elmer TGA 7. UV/Vis absorption spectra were measured with a Jasco V-550 
spectrophotometer. The X-ray diffraction data was recorded on a Rigaku RINT 
2500 series instrument with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation. The sample was held 
in a quartz capillary inside a temperature-controlled cell (Rigaku LC high- 
temperature controller). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) 
microphotographs were measured with a JEOL HR-FESEM JSM-6700F 
(Osaka, Japan) instrument. 
 
Synthesis of Monomers (Schemes 1 and 2) 
The chemical structures of chiral and liquid crystalline monomers used in 
this investigation are illustrated in Scheme 1. Scheme 2 shows the synthetic 
routes for the target chiral monomers M1-M3. 4-(6-Acryloyloxyhexyloxy) 
benzoic acid was synthesized in our laboratory according to the literature.23 
Chiral monomers M4-M6 were synthesized following processes similar to 
those reported in our previous reports. 20,23-25 Liquid crystalline monomers M7 
and M8 were synthesized according to the procedures described in the 
literature26,27 and our previous reports.20,23 The obtained products were purified 
and then identified using FTIR, 1H-NMR, and elemental analysis.

Hydroquinone (2.64 g, 0.024 mol), triethylamine (2.63 g, 0.026 mol), and dry 
dichloromethane (50 ml) were put inside of a 150 ml two-necked flask 
equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Then, menthyl chloroformate (4.37 g, 0.02 
mol) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring of the resulting solution. 
After the reaction mixture was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h at 
30 oC, the solution was poured into water and extracted with chloroform. The 
organic layer was washed several times with water, dried over anhydrous

Polymerization (Scheme 3) 
Homopolymers and copolymers were obtained by the polymerization of 
monomers in benzene in presence of 3 mol % of 2,2’-azobisisobutyronitrile 
(AIBN) at 60 oC for 24 hours. A feed molar ratio of 83/17 of the comonomers 
was used to prepare binary copolymers. The typical synthetic procedures for 
the polymers are described as follows: To a solution of predetermined amount 
monomers in benzene was added with 3 mol % of 2,2’-azobisisobutyronitrile 
(AIBN). These monomers were poured into a glass polymerization tube 
equipped with a sealing cap, which was degassed in a vacuum using a 
freeze-thaw technique and then sealed. After completion of polymerization, the 
polymers were precipitated in a large amount of methanol solution, and then 
the crude polymers were purified by dissolution in benzene and reprecipitation 
in methanol. Polymers were then dried in vacuum.

CP1 to CP12 were synthesized by a procedure similar to that for 
hopolymerization.  The synthesized copolymers were identified using FT-IR, 
and 1H-NMR.  
Fabrication of Liquid Crystalline Polymer Films 
Glass plates were cleaned using a detergent solution and then were washed 
with water and acetone using ultrasonic equipment for 20 and 60 minutes, 
respectively. After completion of the cleaning process, the plates were dried in 
vacuum. The surface of the glass was coated with polyvinyl alcohol 
(Mw=20,000), dried, and then rubbed. A solution of polymer was made by 
dissolving roughly 0.2 g of the sample in 2 ml of benzene. The solution was 
coated onto a glass substrate and further dried in a vacuum for 24 hours. The 
cholesteric polymer film was achieved by thermal annealing under the 
temperature of liquid crystal phase for 40-60 minutes. The obtained films were 
80-100 μm in thickness and were examined for their optical properties. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Synthesis and Characterization 
In order to investigate the effect of spacer length and linking group between 
the rigid mesogenic core and terminal group on molecular interaction and 
physical properties of polymers, as shown in Scheme 1, a series of both chiral 
monomers end capped with various chiral segments and liquid crystalline 
monomers with six or eleven methylene segments were synthesized. The 
synthetic routes of the chiral monomers M1 to M3 are shown in Scheme 2. 
Elemental analysis, FTIR, 1H, and 13C-NMR spectroscopic techniques were 
used to identify the structures and constitutional composition of target 
monomers, as shown in the experimental section. A reasonable quantification 
of all protons of the synthesized monomers was also measured by peak area 
integrals in the 1H-NMR spectra. 13C-NMR and DEPT135 measurements were 
adapted to confirm the structure of M3. Assignments of each carbon and 
proton were assisted by the two-dimensional C-H HMQC spectrum (Figure 1), 
and the spectrum agreed well with the proposed molecular structure of M3. A 
full assignment of the resonances of the aromatic protons and carbons was 
assisted by the HMQC experiments, shown in the signals e, f, and g of Figure 1. 
The aromatic protons at the positions (Hf) appeared at the most downfield (8.12 
ppm) as a doublet. The other 13C signals were well connected with the 
corresponding protons, as shown in the C-H HMQC spectrum (Figure 1). The 
structures of monomers were also confirmed by elemental analysis. 
 
 10
feed molar ratio, the content of M1 to M6 in copolymer shown in Table 1 is 
higher than that in feed composition. The results suggest that the monomer 
reactivity ratios may affect the copolymerization leading to the variations of 
the copolymer composition.28  
Scheme 3 shows the molecular structure of the polymers synthesized in this 
investigation. As seen in Table 1, the molecular weight (Mw) of copolymers in 
series B is higher than that in series A. This might be due to the difference in 
the molecular structure, polarity, and molecular interaction between monomers, 
leading to the variation of the polymerization rates. Theoretically, specific 
rotation reveals the effect of the net vector of the polar bonds of the chiral 
molecules on plane polarized light. The specific rotation of menthyl 
chloroformate and cholesteryl chloroformate are -82o and -28o, respectively. 
Accordingly, the specific rotation of the chiral monomers derived from these 
compounds revealed negative values. As seen in Table 2, chiral monomers end 
capped with a menthyl group revealed a higher specific rotation than those end 
capped with cholesteryl group. As seen in Table 1, the specific rotation of the 
copolymers was also estimated. Cleavage of the double bond and the binding 
of other monomers together did not seem to significantly affect the chirality of 
the compounds. The results also indicate that the specific rotation depends not 
only on the content of chiral units in polymers but also the coherence of 
polarity due to chemical bonding after polymerization.

presence of chiral smectic A phases (SA*; fan-shaped texture) in CP5 and 
CP10, while chiral nematic characteristics (N*; oily streaky texture) were seen 
in CP6. As compared with CP3, CP6 containing longer methylene unit in side 
chain exhibited higher phase transition temperature. The result indicates that 
the variation in spacer length might affect both the freedom of the mesogenic 
unit from the polymer backbone and the overall length of the side chain unit.29

As shown in Table 3, liquid crystalline homopolymers P1 and P2, 
synthesized from M7 and M8, revealed much higher thermal resistance than 
the corresponding copolymers. Series A copolymers revealed relatively lower 
thermal resistance, as compared to that of series B copolymers. Based on 
molecular structure, the existence of the carbonate group as a linkage might 
reduce the lateral molecular interaction, leading to the decrease of molecular 
arrangement order from a smectic to a nematic phase, as shown in Table 1, and 
the decrease of thermal resistance, as shown in Table 3. Theoretically, the 
thermal resistance of polymers reveals polymer bond strength. However, the 
 16
molecular modeling calculation using CS Chem3DPro, employing MM2 
energy parameters, the estimated all-trans molecular length l of the most 
extended conformation of chiral monomer M3 is around 37.5 Å (the layer 
d-spacing value is ca. 30.2 Å by XRD patterns; l/d= 0.81). Therefore, a 
possible layer structure of CP5 is suggested to exhibit intercalated packing of 
the side chains. However, for the copolymers with nematic characteristics, no 
peak appeared in the small angle region, and the broad peak in the range of 2θ 
= 15-25o was examined, classically due to the average lateral distance between 
the neighboring chains with d-spacing of 3-5 Å at mesophases, as shown in 
Figures 5 (b).31

Selective Light Reflection of Cholesteric Polymer 
Due to the presence of molecular chirality, the cholesterically ordered 
material has regions that selectively reflect circularly polarized electromagnetic 
radiation of a band of wavelengths. The central wavelength (λo) of the band of 
reflected wavelengths is determined by the pitch (p) of the molecular helix, 
according to the following formula of Bragg reflection 
λo= n pcosθ                        (1) 
where n  is the average refractive index of the cholesterically ordered material 
and θ is the angle of incidence of the beam. The bandwidth ∆λ is given by 
∆λ= p×∆n                          (2) 
where ∆n is the birefringence of the uniaxially oriented phase corresponding to 
the cholesterically ordered phase. In the visible range, the regions selectively 
reflect circularly polarized light of a particular color.18,32,33 The influence of the 
copolymer composition on the pitch of the cholesteric helix, and therefore the 
reflection wavelength, is described by the helical twisting power (HTP) which 
is defined as the initial slope of the inverse helical pitch p-1 vs. the mole 
fraction x of the chiral dopant.34
