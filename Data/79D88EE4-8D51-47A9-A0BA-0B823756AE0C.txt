2ozone is a harmful pollutant that causes illness
including reduced lung functions. Children, elderly,
and people with asthma are particularly vulnerable.
The objective of this research is to establish a
statistical model to forecast peak daily 1-hr ambient
ozone levels at Ta-Liao, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The
methodology was introduced from a reasonable
model which once was adequately implemented for
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States in 1999 and
2002 (Liu and Johnson, 2003). In this study, several
Box-Jenkins univariate and multivariate time series
models were designed and tested for the Ta-Liao
monitoring site. In order to increase the forecast
accuracy, principal component analyses were
conducted in order to decide one of the predictor
variables. The resultant optimal model was
determined by a series of statistics that are useful in
model performance evaluation.
According to the Environmental Protection
Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (ROC EPA),
air quality in Taiwan has been remarkably improved
by carrying out important measures of ozone
pollution control, such as fuel use quality restrictions
and related emission regulations. On the other hand,
particular matter (PM10) and ozone have been
significant air pollutants since 1994 (R.O.C. EPA,
2006). While suspended PM10 and ozone
contributed to 76% and 24% of air pollution in 1994,
respectively; since 2002, ozone began to replace
PM10 as a major air pollutant by contributing 78%
of the air pollution (R.O.C. EPA, 2006). Therefore,
ozone becomes the alternative pollutant indicator
besides PM10 for air quality forecasting in Taiwan.
2. FRAMEWORK
2.1. Database determination
Due to the significant high ozone exceedances,
the modeling site was decided to be the Ta-Liao
monitoring site located in southern Taiwan. The
modeling years of 1997-2001 were selected and
stationarity were achieved by a logarithm
transformation. The Box-Jenkins ARIMA method
applies only to stationary data series, which by
definition, have corresponding mean, variance, and
autocorrelation coefficients that are essentially
constant through time (Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel,
1994; Pankratz, 1983). Nonstationarity of the
original peak daily 1-hr ozone data we were removed
by a logarithm transformation. The means and
variances of both of the original and the
log-transformed peak daily 1-hr ozone are described
in Table 1. As a result, log ozone instead of original
ozone levels were practiced throughout this study
with a constant mean and variance, 1.80 and 0.07,
respectively.

2.2 Diurnal pattern observation
Each of the potential predictor variables were
examined with their diurnal patterns, which was
deliberately plotted with that of the peak daily 1-hr
ozone. The diurnal pattern will exhibit possible
correlation between the variables and ozone, and
formation of ozone could be tracked with the
formation of precursors through time. In each year
during 1995-2003, two typical high ozone days were
selected with the criteria of being the highest, the
second highest, or the third highest peak daily 1-hr
ozone concentrations, as well as with adequate data
availability. The selected days and the associated
peak daily 1-hr ozone concentrations are listed in
Table 2.
4of the predictors in the existing ozone models. The
24-hr average PM10 was employed to be one of the
predictor variables in the model development. High
dew point temperatures were addressed favorable for
photochemical reactions and positive correlation
should be addressed (Comrie, 1990; Comrie and
Yarnal, 1992; Comrie, 1997). However, in southern
Taiwan, the correlation between ozone and dew point
temperature tended to be negative and somewhat
insignificant (-0.10 ~ -0.28). It was unusual that the
correlation coefficient between temperature and
ozone was not as obvious as that has been addressed
in the literature (Comrie, 1990; Comrie, 1997; Liu
and Johnson, 2002; Liu and Johnson, 2003).
Therefore, instead of using daily observation through
out the entire year, the correlation coefficient was
analyzed again with the so-called “ozone seasons,”
September, October, November, December, and
January. As a result in Table 3, during the high
ozone season, peak daily temperature is better
correlated with the peak daily 1-hr ozone. The
observation emphasized the importance of using high
ozone seasons to be the modeling data domain.

ozone with potential predictor variables.
3. METHODOLOGY
This research used Box-Jenkins multivariate
time series models in combination with principal
component analysis (PCA) (Box, Jenkins, Reinsel,
1994; Johnson and Wichern, 1992). A special
modeling method called Regression with Time Series
Errors (RTSE) was adapted. The RTSE model is one
kind of multivariate time series model which
considered the variance contributed from the
meteorological and NOx variables to the ozone
formation. SAS/ETS was employed for the model
establishment (SAS, 1991). In the RTSE model, the
predictors were not only meteorological and NOx
variables, but also a “PC trigger.”The PC trigger
derived from a principal component analysis became
one of the predictors in addition to the conventional
meteorological and NOx predictors. The PC trigger
in the RTSE model was designed for ozone above
100 parts per billion (ppb), and was treated as value
of zero for the days that ozone below 100 ppb. The
RTSE model was useful in not only the
autocorrelation of ozone but also the meteorological
variance can be simultaneously estimated. A
frequently observed problem occurring in regression
analysis is that some of the employed regression
models seriously violate a required assumption.
Pearson correlations and t tests provide
meaningful results only if the following assumptions
can be satisfied: the error component is normally
distributed,
statistically
independent,
and with a
constant
variance (i.i.d.
assumption).Ho
wever, the
assumption of
statistical
independence is violated because of serial or
autocorrelation (Connell et al. 2005). Box-Jenkins
ARIMA models relax the assumption of
independence and are consistent with the nature of
serially correlated air pollutants.

5. CONCLUSIONS
This study established four different
Box-Jenkins time series models to predict peak daily
1-hr ozone concentrations, Ta-Liao, 1997-2001. It is
concluded that the univariate ARIMA time series
model was not as useful as the three different RTSE
model. The POD value was improved about 5 folds
(0.4033/0.0884) when the univariate model was
replaced by the RTSE model, and achieved almost 8
folds (0.6851/0.0884) when it was replaced by the
RTSE model with PC1.
Moreover, the RTSE model containing a PC
trigger indeed enhanced the ozone predictability, on
both of the ozone above 120 ppb and the overall
statistics. After the PC trigger is introduced in the
RTSE model, the POD was increased 69.9% and the
FAR was reduced 8.3%. The overall correlation
between the observed and predicted ozone was
improved 9.6%. The FB and MAPE were greatly
dropped 82.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Also, the first
principal component was concluded to be more
useful than the first two components in playing the
“trigger”role, though it only counted for 58.62% of
the environmental variance in the high ozone days.
In summary, the RTSE model with PC1 was
concluded to be the optimal model which was
advanced in predicting the ozone above 120 ppb as
well as the overall ozone values. The RTSE model
with PC(1+2) did not perform as it was expected.
Introduction of only PC1 in the RTSE model
demonstrated a superior predictability.
