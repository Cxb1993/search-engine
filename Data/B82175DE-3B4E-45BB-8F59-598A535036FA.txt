Abstract
Motivated by the question of how many point-estimator digits to report in a statistical
experiment, we investigate the probabilistic behavior of the digits of the point estimator
as a function of the standard error. We deﬁne meaningful and meaningless digits of the
point estimator by comparing to the discrete uniform distribution of a meaningless digit.
We show that the leading-digit rule—reporting the point estimate through the leading
digit of the standard error— implies that the ﬁrst unreported digit has no more than
probability 0.117 of being correct, which is not much better than the one-in-ten chance
of a uniformly distributed random digit.
1 Introduction
Statistical experiments provide a point estimator Θˆ of an unknown system performance
measure θ. The precision of the point estimator is indicated by the standard error,
σ = var1/2(Θˆ). Typically, Θˆ converges to θ as the run length n is increased, with the
standard error decreasing inversely proportional to n1/2.
Reporting the results of a statistical experiment has two components: (1) stating the
value of the point estimate, θˆ, and (2) indicating the value of the standard error, σ. This
paper is motivated by the ﬁrst component: How many point-estimator digits to report?
We analyze the probabilistic behavior of the digits of the point estimator as a function of
the standard error. We deﬁne meaningful and meaningless digits of the point estimator
by comparing to the discrete uniform distribution of a meaningless digit.
To answer the motivating question—how many point estimator digit to report—we
propose not to report meaningless digits.
Discussion on the reporting format and procedures, including how many standard-error
digits to report and whether to truncate or round point estimate and standard error, can
be seen in Song and Schmeiser (2006).
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we deﬁne notation and
deﬁnitions. In Section 3, we investigate the probabilistic behavior of Θˆ and of its digits.
In Section 4, we discuss the number of point-estimator digits to report? Section 5 is the
summary and conclusions.
2 Notation and definitions
We begin with some notation and deﬁnitions about the unknown performance-measure
value θ, the point estimator Θˆ, the point estimate θ̂, and its standard error σ. Throughout,
2
quality of the truncated point estimator Θˆj for all values of j, with the untruncated Θˆ
being the limiting case as j decreases.
In the following subsections, we deﬁne the probability of correct truncation, pj , and
the conditional probability that all digits on the left of the jth digit is correct, cj. We
also discuss properties of these probabilities, provide examples, and ﬁnally discuss how
we deﬁne digits to be meaningless and meaningful.
3.1 Distributions of the truncated point estimator Θˆj
Because our motivation is discarding meaningless digits of point estimate in statistical
experiments where sample sizes are large, we assume that Θˆ has negligible bias and is
approximately normally distributed. Therefore, the standard error σ is the usual, and a
reasonable, measure of the quality of Θˆ.
We could measure the quality of the point estimator Θˆ truncated at the jth digit using
P(|Θˆj − θj | ≤ h× 10j)
for any h = 0, 1, .... That is, the point estimator succeeds if its truncated value is within h
units of the truncated value of the true value θ. A bit arbitrarily, we choose to use h = 0,
exact equality, yielding a speciﬁc deﬁnition of the probability of correct truncation.
Before discussing the probability of correct truncation, we want to discuss two distri-
butions associated with Θˆj . First, deﬁne
pj(i) ≡ P(..., T̂j+2 = tj+2, T̂j+1 = tj+1, T̂j = i)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9, the joint probability that all digits to the left of column j are correct
and that T̂j , the digit in column j, takes the speciﬁed value i.
Second, we deﬁne the conditional distribution of T̂j given that all previous digits are
correct. Let
cj(i) ≡ P(T̂j = i|Θˆj+1 = θj+1)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9, the conditional probability that T̂j = i given that all previous digits
are correct. For every integer value of j, these probabilities are related by
cj(i) = pj(i)/
9∑
k=0
pj(k)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9 and therefore
∑9
i=0 cj(i) = 1.
4
because the right-most digits T̂j are independent of each other. Between these two ex-
tremes, the inﬁnite range of Θˆ implies that cj < 1 for every position j and therefore the
sequence pj is monotonically decreasing, i.e.,
1 > · · · > p2 > p1 > p0 > p−1 > · · · > 0 . (4)
More speciﬁcally, total probability implies that for every column j
pj =
9∑
k=0
pj−1(k). (5)
For asymptotically small values of j, the pj(i) values are easy to approximate, because
lim
j→−∞
pj(i)
f(θ)10j
= 1, (6)
where f denotes the density function of Θˆ. This limiting value provides a good approxi-
mation for all pj(i) for j < l (that is, in positions to the right of the leading-digit position
l). (For the normal distribution, f(θ) = (σ
√
2π)−1 ≈ (σ × 2.507)−1.)
For i = 0, 1, . . . , 9, the asymptotic result in Equation (6) leads to
lim
j→−∞
cj(i) = lim
j→−∞
pj(i)
pj+1
= lim
j→−∞
pj
pj+1
= 0.1. (7)
That is, the right-most digits of Θˆ are uniformly distributed and therefore meaning-
less. Because the correct-truncation probabilities, pj, are monotonically decreasing, the
meaningful-digit probabilities monotonically decrease to the limiting values; that is,
1 > · · · > c2 > c1 > c0 > c−1 > · · · > 0.1. (8)
3.4 Probability bounds
Suppose that we report the truncated point estimate θ̂j , where j = . . . , 1, 0,−2, . . .. Here
we provide probability bounds for pj, pj−1 and cj−1 in the experiment when 10l ≤ σ <
10l+1, where j is the right-most reported position, and j − 1 is the left-most unreported
position. The derivation of these bounds in given in Appendix A.
Theorem 1. If Θˆ is normally distributed, then for any values of the performance measure
θ and standard error 10l ≤ σ < 10l+1 (i.e., with the leading digit in Position l),
pj ≥ Φ(10j/σ)− 0.5, (9)
Therefore, always
pj ≥ Φ(10j−l−1)− 0.5, (10)
6
Corollary 2. This is the special case of Theorem 1, 2, and 3 when j = l. If Θˆ is
normally distributed, then for any values of the performance measure θ and standard
error 10l ≤ σ < 10l+1 (i.e., with the leading digit in Position l),
pl ≥ Φ(10l/σ)− 0.5 (18)
Therefore, always
pl ≥ Φ(1/10)− 0.5 ≈ 0.0398, (19)
with equality in the limit as σ → 10l+1. When σ = 10l,
pl ≥ Φ(1)− 0.5 ≈ 0.3413, (20)
with equality when θl = θ.
pl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(10l−1/(2σ))− 0.5]. (21)
Therefore, σ = 10l yields the minimal upper bound
pl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(0.05)− 0.5] ≈ 0.0399. (22)
cl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(10
l−1/(2σ))− 0.5]
Φ(10l/σ)− 0.5 . (23)
Therefore, σ = 10l yields the minimal upper bound
cl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(0.05)− 0.5]
Φ(1)− 0.5
≈ 0.117. 
(24)

Because there is no speciﬁc digit with the corresponding meaningful-digit probability
exactly 0.1, it is practically useless to deﬁne a digit to be meaningless if its meaningful-
digit probability is 0.1. The issue then is how to easily identify the meaningless digits
as based on the correct-truncation probabilities pj or the meaningful-digit probabilities
cj as computed using θ̂. We considered and discarded various ideas, one of which we
discuss here. The practitioner could omit all digits T̂j for which pj is less than a speciﬁed
bound, which would be approximately 0.04 or 0.05; or for which cj is less than a speciﬁed
bound, which would be approximately 0.11. Two disadvantages caused us to discard this
approach. First, computing such probabilities before reporting is cumbersome. Second,
the threshhold seemed arbitrary.
We deﬁne digit i to be -meaningless if c(i) ≤ 0.1 + . We also deﬁne digit i to be
-meaningful if it is not -meaningless. Consider two scenarios. One. If 0.017 ≤  < 0.666,
we have shown in Inequalities (17) and (24) that all digits of the point estimate to the
right of the leading digit of the σ (i.e., digits l − 1, l − 2, . . .) are -meaningless. Two. If
0.0005 ≤  < 0.017, we have shown in Inequalities (24) and (31) that all digits of the
point estimate to the right of the second-leading digit of the σ (i.e., digits l− 2, l− 3, . . .)
are -meaningless.
3.6 An example of correct-truncation and meaningful-digit probabilities
Tables 1 and 2 show values of pj(i) and cj(i) for j = 3, 2, . . . ,−3,−4 and i = 0, 1, . . . , 8, 9,
respectively, under the assumption that Θˆ is normally distributed with mean θ = 123.4500
and standard error σ = 0.6789. These parameter values are chosen arbitrarily, other than
to use various digit values for clarity.
The structure and meaning of Tables 1 and 2 is straightforward. Ten rows correspond
to the ten possible digit values {0, 1, . . . , 9}. The right-most eight columns correspond to
the digit positions, with order of magnitude ranging from 103 to 10−4. Each column is
labeled with j (its power of ten).
In Table 1, the (i, j)th entry is pj(i), the joint probability of the point estimator
being correct through Position j + 1 and truncating to T̂j = i. For instance, the entry
corresponding to T̂j = 0 and j = −1 is P(..., T̂j+2 = tj+2, T̂j+1 = tj+1, T̂j = 0) = P(123.0 ≤
Θ̂ < 123.1) = 0.049371.
Similarly, in Table 2 the (i, j)th entry is cj(i), the probability of the jth digit condi-
tional that all previous digits are correct, P(T̂j = i|Θˆj+1 = θj+1) for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9.
10
First consider the highlighted entry pj in the row corresponding to T̂j = tj in Table
1. The value of pj , j = −4, . . . , 3, is the probability of correct truncation: p3 = 1.0, p2 =
1.0, p1 = 0.9999998, p0 = 0.5373512, p−1 = 0.0587104, p−2 = 0.0058761, p−3 = 0.0005876
and p−4 = 0.0000588, the maximum values in each column. As always happens, the
probabilities pj monotonically decrease from one to zero, consider σ with Inequalities (4).
Consider σ with Equation (6), the right-side (say j ≤ −1) values of pj are approximately
equal to f(θ)10j = (σ
√
2π)−110j ≈ (0.6789× 2.5066)−110j ≈ 0.5876× 10j.
Now consider columns toward the right side of Table 1. All probabilities in each
Position j are approximately equal, and therefore approximately equal to pj. Also, the
probabilities decrease by a factor of ten as j is increased by one. This regular behavior
arises from the right-most digits T̂j being uniformly and independently distributed. When
such digits are incorrect (conditionally on the previous digits being correct), the corre-
sponding values of cj (in Table 2) are close to 0.1. Such digits are (almost) meaningless
in that they are (almost) independent of the digits of the point estimate θ̂.
Fundamental to determining which digits to omit is determining the left column of
the meaningless digits. The probabilities in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the statistical
experiment is “working on” determining the value of t0 = 3, which currently has proba-
bility p0 ≈ 0.537 and cj ≈ 0.537 of correctly truncating to Θˆ0 = 123. The digits further
left are deterministic. The distribution of Θˆ0, conditional that previous digits are correct,
is centered on the correct value Θˆ0 = 123 and has probability p0(2)+ p0(3)+ p0(4) ≈ 0.97
of truncating to within one unit of the correct value θ0 = 123.
As the statistical experiment completes the determination of digit T̂0, it has just begun
to work on the value of t−1 = 4. Four is the most likely value, with a meaningful-digit
probability c−1  0.11 (in Table 2) ; that is, the experiment truncates to the correct value
t−1 = 4 about one time in nine replications. Thus the digit T̂−1 is performing just a bit
better than if it were uniform and independent. While digit T̂0 is worth reporting, digit
T̂−1 can be omitted with little loss of statistical quality.
4 How Many Point-Estimator Digits to Report?
We now discuss the motivating question—how many point-estimator digits to report? Our
reporting principle is to report only -meaningful digits of the point estimate. In other
word, we do not report -meaningless digits of the point estimate. Reporting meaningless
digits not only wastes reporting space (because they are all noise and no signal), but also
can lead to an incorrect interpretation.
12
4.2 The analysis of the second-leading-digit rule—reporting θ̂l−1
We analyze the probabilistic behavior of the truncated point estimate θ̂l−1 through the
second-leading digit l − 1 of the standard error. The second-leading-digit rule is more
conservative than the leading-digit rule in reporting digits, but does protect users from
loss of statistical information.
First, we discuss the behavior of the right-most reported digit T̂l−1. Bounds (25), (26),
and (27) indicates that T̂l−1 contains some statistical information about the performance
measure θ. At no time can the correct-truncation probability pl be smaller than 0.004,
which occurs when T̂l−1 is ﬁrst reported. Later, when n has increased one-hundred fold,
which is at the moment that Θl−2 is ﬁrst reported, the correct-truncation probability has
increased to at least pl−1 = 0.0398. That is, the probability that all reported digits match
the performance measure θ begins at about one chance in 250 and increases to about one
chance in twenty ﬁve.
Now, we discuss the behavior of the left-most unreported digit T̂l−2. Bounds (28)—
(31) guarantee that T̂l−2 contains negligible statistical information about the performance
measure θ. In particular, pl−2 ≤ 0.004 and cl−1 ≤ 0.1005. The former value 0.004, which is
almost equal to the lower bound for pl, guarantees that θ̂l−2 is correct to all digits less than
four time in thousand. The latter value 0.1005 is essentially the same as the one-in-ten
chance of uniformly distributed random digits, which would contain no information at all
about θ. Most of the time, while σ is not close to its lower bound 10l, the most-important
unreported digit θ̂l−2 contains even less information.
4.3 An example when a new digit is just about to be reported
Tables 3 and 4 show pj(i) and cj(i) values for an experiment with performance measure
θ = 123.45 and its point estimator Θˆ has standard error σ = 0.100. This is the moment
in the experiment of Tables 1 and 2 when the sample size n has become large enough that
the standard error has fallen to a change in order of magnitude. For example, when σ is
going to change from 0.100 to 0.0999. In terms of the leading-digit rule, Position (−1)
has long been reported and Position (−2) is just ready to be reported. In terms of the
second-leading-digit rule, Position (−2) has long been reported and Position (−3) is just
ready to be reported.
Here, we show that the leading-digit rule (reporting θ̂l) is a bit conservative in this
example. Applying the leading-digit rule, the earlier positions have made progress: T̂0 =
t0 = 3 is now quite likely to be correct and T̂−1 is well on its way to identifying t−1 = 4.)
14
4.5 Yoneda’s Rule
Song and Schmeiser (1994) proposed reporting only meaningful digits of Θˆ, with no ex-
plicit statement of sampling uncertainty (such as the standard error or conﬁdence in-
tervals). In response, Yoneda (1996) proposed truncating Θˆ to Θˆk so that the reader’s
uncertainty about the ﬁrst unreported digit T̂k−1 approximated the uncertainty in Θˆ as
measured by the standard error σ. In particular, he minimized the discrepancy between
the reader’s subjective uniform distribution and the point-estimator’s objective normal
distribution. Using the Kullback-Leibler information measure, he approximated the min-
imum to obtain the closed-form rule that reports Θˆk where k = log10(
√
6σ).
Yoneda’s rule reports a new digit a bit later than the leading-digit rule. In particular,
Yoneda’s rule roughly omits all digits that are 0.6-meaningless, compared to the leading-
digit rule’s omitting digits that are 0.117-meaningless. Both rules are reasonable, however,
because they have diﬀerent purposes. Yoneda mimics the distribution of Θˆ to reﬂect
uncertainty; the leading-digit rule mimics Θˆ without wasting space and causing confusion
with random-noise digits. Both rules, as do all rational rules, print a new digit every time
that the sample size increases by a factor of one hundred.
5 Summary and Conclusions
The motivation of this research is to determine the number of point-estimator digits to
report in statistical experiments. We investigate the probabilistic behavior of a truncated
point estimator and its digits via two probabilities: “correct-truncation” and “meaningful-
digit” probabilities. We use these probabilities to deﬁne meaningless and meaningful
digits.
Conceptually, any speciﬁc digit is meaningless if its meaningful-digit probability is 0.1,
which is the one-in-ten chance of uniformly distributed random digits, indicating that this
digit contains no information about the performance measure θ. Due to the fact that there
is no speciﬁc digit with the corresponding meaningful-digit probability exactly 0.1, it is
practically useless to deﬁne a digit to be meaningless if its meaningful-digit probability is
0.1.
In this paper, we deﬁne a point-estimate digit to be -meaningless if its meaningful-
digit probability is less than or equal to 0.1+ , where  is a small positive real value. We
also deﬁne a point-estimate digit to be -meaningful if it is not -meaningless. We propose
to discard -meaningless digits of the point estimate because reporting meaningless digits
is not only wasting reporting space but might leading to an incorrect interpretation.

Equality (35) is the deﬁnition of pj−1. Inequality (36) holds because Θˆ is normally dis-
tributed and therefore the mode occurs at its mean θ. Speciﬁcally, Two areas θj−1 ≤ Θˆ <
θj−1+10j−1 and θ− 10

10j−1, but the area θ − 10
j−1
2
≤ Θˆ < θ + 10
j−1

is closer to the mode θ. Equalities (37)
and (38) hold because Θˆ is normally distributed.
