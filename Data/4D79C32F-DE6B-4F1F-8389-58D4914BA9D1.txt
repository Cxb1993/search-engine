Abstract 
This article explores the concept of manufacturing 
flexibility and formulates a general mathematical 
measurement model. The conceptual framework 
proposed in this research contains multi-attribute 
characteristics to depict the meaning of flexibility 
in manufacturing systems. The graph theory and 
matrix approach (GTMA), incorporating the 
multiple attribute decision making (MADM) 
approach, is employed to evaluate the production 
flexibility of a manufacturing system. 
1. Introduction 
Although researchers have already conducted 
comprehensive research into manufacturing system 
flexibility, agreement has not so far been reached 
on how to define the flexibility concept in 
academic terms nor how to implement the concept 
in practice. Because  inconsistent concepts of 
manufacturing flexibility have been proposed in the 
literature, the establishment of a unified flexibility 
measurement model for academic and practical 
application has been impeded (Baykasoğlu, 2009). 
Wilson and Platt (2010) highlighted the fact that 
research opportunities exist in the area of flexibility 
measurement and flexibility achievement. 
Recently Baykasoğlu’s (2009) model of the graph 
theory and matrix approach (GTMA),  the first 
work in which GTMA is used for manufacturing 
flexibility measurement, claimed that it is a 
generalized flexibility measurement method. 
Baykasoğlu extended Chang et al.’s (2001) 
machine flexibility measurement approach, which 
considers that flexibility is a  function of capacity 
and capability, and combined it with 
Chryssolouris’s (1996) proposal of ‘sensitivity to 
change’ (STC), indicating a measure for 
inflexibility, and integrated these into GTMA as a 
quantification model for machine flexibility 
measurement. Graph theory is not only effective in 
handling system structure problems but also in 
dealing with the relationships between system 
elements. The applications of GTMA in the 
literature can be improved by incorporating the 
multi-attribute decision making (MADM) approach, 
such as the data envelopment analysis (DEA) 
method as the application tools to evaluate the 
related attribute values.  
2. Literature survey of related works 
2.1 Manufacturing flexibility attributes in 
the literature 
In the literature, researchers have proposed 
different attributes to explain the meaning of 
manufacturing flexibility, and these various 
perspectives have resulted in different 
measurement approaches. Slack (1987) included 
two major attributes in the flexibility concept, 
namely range flexibility, the possible states 
performed by a system, and response flexibility, the 
time needed to move from one state to another. The 
former is equivalent in meaning to the versatility 
attribute, while the latter has the same properties as 
the efficiency attribute. Brill and Mandelbaum 
 Page 4 of 8 
approach has the advantages that it is able to 
consider multiple inputs and multiple outputs 
simultaneously and there is no need to have a 
theoretical production function before the 
evaluation. In the DEA model, first, a system is 
defined as a decision making unit (DMU); second, 
there must be input and output variables for the 
DMUs. With these, we can measure the efficiency 
value of a DMU against best practice in the peer 
group (Farrell, 1957). This research defines a 
production line as a system in the DEA model, and 
the basic mathematical model (CCR) is that 
proposed by Charnes et al. (1978). 
Suppose that there are m products being evaluated, 
each product uses r inputs and produces s outputs. 
Then, the efficiency of product 0 will be: 
 (1) 
subject to 
 
 
 
where ylj is the amount of the ith output for the jth 
product, xkj is the amount of the kth input for the 
jth product, and ul, vk, are variable weights to be 
determined by the solution to the above 
maximization equation (Charnes et al. 1978). 
3.2 Production probability and weighted 
Importance evaluation 
(1) Production probability (Pi) 
 (2) 
where PTi is total production time of product i. 
(2) Product importance weight  
 (3) 
PCi: total production cost of product i. 
3.3 Variety measurement  
Variety measure is used to capture the difference 
between product types. The difference scale of 0.1-
0.3-0.9 is used for the judgment (difference: strong: 
0.9; moderate: 0.3; weak: 0.1). Geometric mean is 
applied to integrate the difference of the evaluators 
as follows:

where dij denotes the degree of difference between 
product i and j. 
3.4 Efficiency index calculation  
This is defined by the multiplication of efficiency 
value (Ei), production probability (Pi), and 
weighted importance of product i (Wi). Therefore 
the efficiency index is calculated by  
EIi=Pi*Wi*Ei. (5) 
3.5 Mobility measurement 
Further the production data are used to generate 
product changeover efficiency (mij) and the 
probability of production change from product i to 
product j (pij).  
(1) Product changeover efficiency   
Product changeover efficiency is defined as 
mobility, based on the comparison of changeover 
time. As the expectancy of changeover time is that 
less is better, the following Eq. (6) is employed. 
 (6) 
where CTij denotes the changeover time from 
product i to j.  
(2) Probability of product changeover 
The probability of production change from product 
i to product j (pij), is calculated by the frequency of 
the changes among the products.  
 (7) 
where Nij denotes the number of times of 
changeover from product i to j.  
Then, the mobility index is evaluated by  
MIij=pij*mij. (8) 
3.6 Flexibility measurement 
If the efficiency index and mobility index are 
smaller than 1, this can cause the permanent 
function to be too small. Baykasoğlu (2009) 
suggested an exponential power to transform the 
efficiency index and mobility index into values 
larger than 1, as follows.

4. Case implementation 
4.1 Case description 
The production data were collected from a small 
paper pipe manufacturer. The company produces a 
wide variety of customized products, which cause 
the production lines and systems to change 
frequently. Data were gathered for only two 
production lines: for five products from line 1 and 
eight products from line 2 . The data included setup 
time, production time, production cost, production 
quantity and quality for each product, as shown in 
Table 1.

Step 1. Efficiency evaluation  
The production time, cost, quantity and quality are 
included in the DEA model to calculate the 
efficiency for each product. The software Frontier 
Analyst 4 is employed to measure the efficiency 
value for each product. The results are shown in 
column (7) of Table 1. 
Step 2. Production probability and weighted 
Importance evaluation for each product 
Eqs. (2) and (3) are used to produce the production 
probability and weighted importance for each 
product. They are presented in columns (8) and (9) 
of Table 1 respectively. 
Step 3. Variety measure 
The difference scale of 0.1-0.3-0.9 is used for the 
judgment. Geometric mean is applied to evaluate 
the difference of the products. The difference 
between the five products produced by production 
line 1 is shown in Table 2.  
Table 2 Difference matrix of production line 1.

P31 0.9 0.3 0.9 0 0.3 0.52 
P32 0.9 0.1 0.3 0.3 0 0.30 
 
Step 4. Efficiency Index calculation  
Applying Eq. (5) we can obtain the efficiency 
index values as shown in column (11) of Table 1. 
Using Eq. (11) the transformed efficiency index 
can be obtained in column (12) of Table 1. 
Step 5. Mobility Index evaluation 
From other production data the changeover time 
among the products can be obtained as shown in 
Table 3. Using Eqs. (6) and (7), we can display 
changeover efficiency in Table 4.

Feedback for authors: 
Better discusion on measurement theory as well as the way the operationalisation of flexibility 
depends on the underlying technology used in manufacturing 
This paper tackles an issues that is both relevant and interesting, so I think it would be of use for the 
audience at the PMA. A few comments for developing the full paper: 1. Is it a conceptual paper? If 
so, how was the conceptual framework developed? The authors need to explain both the framework 
and the steps they took to arrive at the framework in greater detail. The abstract doesn't have any 
indications as to how this was done, and it's one of the things that make or break conceptual papers. 
2. Where (what disciplines or literature domains) are the roots of this framework? Where does this 
paper really belong. 3. I would recommend that in the full paper the authors expand the discussion 
of how exactly GTMA will address the existing problems identified in the beginning of the paper. 4. 
The contribution seems to be sufficient and interesting, although - again - I would recommend 
phrasing it in terms of the possible solutions to the problems identified in the intro. A good paper 
otherwise!

extended Chang et al.’s (2001) machine flexibility measurement approach, considering that flexibility is the 
function of capacity and capability, and combined Chryssolouris’s (1996) proposal of ‘sensitivity to change’ 
(STC), indicating a measure for inflexibility, and integrated into GTMA as a quantification model for machine 
flexibility measurement. The present research considers that the approach provided by Baykasoğlu (2009) has 
not yet include the whole considerations in the flexibility measurement model. Moreover, the applications of 
GTMA in the literature are not inclusive and can be improved by incorporating MADM approaches, such as 
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), or fuzzy analytical network 
process (FANP) methods as the application tools to evaluate the related attribute values. In all, GTMA is a 
relatively new method of decision-making. It provides a common, simple and convenient method of 
decision-making, involving less computation needed. However, GTMA approach can be improved by 
integrating MADM methods, such that a more comprehensive measurement model for flexibility 
measurement can be obtained. 
Research into the measurement of manufacturing flexibility should consider the attributes embodied in the 
system and propose appropriate respective models for the measurement; otherwise, the results of the 
assessment could lead to a partial solution and increase confusion. The attributes proposed in this project is to 
make the flexibility concept in manufacturing systems clearer and the measurement more sensible. The 
conceptual framework of attributes in flexibility proposed in this research could be worthwhile for further 
theoretical and empirical testing.

製造彈性之研究，在學術上引起重視，已有 30年之久，但過去近 30年來，學者們認為對
於製造彈性概念之推演並沒有增加多少新的概念，大部分僅止於小範圍的闡述。相關研究
學者們強調，發展製造彈性研究議程的關鍵點，應該更著重於實務應用方面之研究。為增
