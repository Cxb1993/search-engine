exchange platform and business model for telerehab 
and health care. The protocols are as follows. The 
first year is to assist ambulatory patients with sub-
acute to chronic stroke by wearable computing over 
wireless sensor network (sub-field 1). Sixty patients 
are recruited by sub-field 3 and are randomly 
assigned to experimental and control group. The 
experimental group receives one month game-based and 
fun-related computer exercise program designed by 
sub-field 2, and trained by physical therapists of 
sub-field 3. The remote care server for the 
collection of multiple physiological signal, falling 
detection and other gait information are set up by 
sub-field 4. The second year is to investigate the 
sitting balance and safety of transfer by the 
intelligent wheelchair with sensor-cushion in 
patients with chronic stroke in long-term care 
facility for telerehab. The third year is to provide 
the telemedicine system combined the intelligent 
assistive devices for the patients at home with 
chronic stroke for custom-made telerehab services. 
Results: This project promotes the telerehab services 
to remote and underserved populations, improves 
quality of life, follow-up care, and reduces the 
consumption of the time and manpower of caregivers 
and medical staff.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Telerehabilitation is known as the delivery of rehabilitation service at a distance via electronic 
information and communication technologies, ranging from the telephone service to the real-time 
videoconferencing through the internet.
1,2
 Only few studies of telerehabilitation in stroke are published after 
2000,
3,4 
and those studies demonstrated mainly the feasibility of using the web-based telerehabilitation to 
improve upper extremity function in chronic post-stroke patients.
5-7 
However, less attention paid to the 
remote training of standing balance in patients with subacute stroke.  
Several applications of telerehabilitation have been identified: TeleMentoring, TeleMonitoring 
TeleEducation, TeleConsultation, TeleSupervision and Teletherapy in post-stroke management.
8
 The 
purposes of this study were to set up the telerehabilitation program including mainly TeleTherapy function, 
and to examine the training effects on balance and daily activities in subjects with subacute stroke.  
 
4 
 
raw total STREAM score is 70, with each of the limb subscales scored out of 20 points and the mobility 
subscale scored out of 30 points, but the subscale and total scores were transformed to scores out of 100 in 
this study with higher scores reflecting a higher level of motor recovery and mobility.
15
 To complete the 
Barthel Index, subjects were asked to rate their ability to accomplish self-care and mobility (i.e. walking) on 
a 3-point scale. Total scores of BI are ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of 
functioning. 
All the participants received 30 minutes balance training twice a week for 4 weeks. The Tele group 
received the teletherapy in the research laboratory of the hospital with the physical therapist at the remote 
research room of the school about 1-4 km away (i.e., from NTUH~ 1 km; TMUH ~ 4 km), and the Conv 
group received the therapy at the gymnastic room of Department of Physical Therapy in the hospital.  
 
Telerehabilitation Systems and Programs 
The telerehabilitation was conducted by personal computers with 24 inch-screens (one regular screen 
for communications and one touch screen for games) and Logitech Webcam and Screen Recorder via on-line 
internet FLASH system. The server was used to store all the videoconferencing signals and the monitored 
data. The address of the web site is http;//smartkms.ctust.edu.tw/fg.  
The therapist instructed standing balance training programs from easy to difficult according to patient’s 
severity and progress. The TeleTherapy focused on standing balance training and was composed of 4 parts: 
(a) ~ 10 minutes on-line standing balance training instructed by therapist (i.e., sit-to stand, squatting, 
stepping, turning, one-leg standing and tandem walking), (b) ~5 minutes standing exercise following 3-D 
animation exercise programs (Appendix A), (c) ~10 minutes finger touching the screen with 3-D interactive 
games in standing posture (Appendix A) and (d) ~5 minutes cool down breathing exercise with arm 
movement (i.e. sound side holding the affected side as necessary) in seated position. The therapist could 
monitor the sequence and duration of on-line exercise and games, and give instructions to correct the errors. 
The Borg scale (6-20) after exercise was asked and was kept around light to moderate exercise intensity 
(Borg scale 12-14).
17
 The animation programs were designed by our team members and were produced by 
Dr. TW Lu (Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan) with Maya/3D Max systems.  
The movements of patients were videotaped by Logitech and stored in the server (located at Central 
Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan), and those could be played back to 
patients to check the performance. 
 
Conventional Programs 
The patient would receive the regular standing balance training programs. It is also composed of 4 parts: 
(a) ~ 10 min standing balance activities (including sit-to stand, squatting, stepping, turning, one-leg standing 
and tandem walking) without using the ball, (b) ~ 10 min standing balance activities with holding the ball, (c) 
~ 5 min standing balance activities with catching the ball, (d) ~ 5 breathing exercise with arm movement in

signal processing circuits. For example, the textile bent knitted with vital sensors, a heart rate sensor and a 
temperature sensor, and a ZigBee control box in shown in Figure 2(b). Sensors are used to measure the 
bio-information of users. The signal processing circuits contains some filters, and ZigBee transceiver is to 
receive remote signals as well as to transmit the data obtained from various sensors to remote mobile phones 
or computers for further applications. The bio-information sensor devices, Sphygmomanometer, 
Blood-oxygenic-meter with a ZigBee node, Thermometer with a ZigBee node, of our real measurement are 
shown in Figure 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), respectively.

CONCLUSION 
 
The interaction between patient and therapist could be built upon teletherapy to improve the balance 
and mobility of patients. The carefully designed standing balance programs, such as 3-D animation 
programs, could be applied in telerehabilitation as an alternative treatment for subacute stroke living at a 
distance.

Outcome Measures 
Pre-post assessment included performance-based Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and pressure-distribution 
assessment; as well as interview-based Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16) and Barthel index (BI) 
questionnaires assessed by one physical therapist  
 
 Balance measurements:The BBS with fourteen items (including sitting and standing balance) 
was used for balance evaluation.
16 
 
 
 Activity measurements: The SIS-16 with 16 items was developed from the Stroke Impact Scale 
3.0 (having 8 domains) with the objective to develop a short instrument to assess physical 
function domain (including hand function and strength, activities of daily living/instrumental 
activities of daily living, and mobility) of stroke. The BI was used to evaluate the functional 
activities in their daily living. It included self-care domain (subscore: 40) and mobility domain 
(subscore: 60) with the total score ranged from 0 to 100.
18
 The higher the score means the less 
severity of stroke 
 
 
Statistical analysis 
The SPSS 17.0 Windows version was used for data analysis. Analyses of Intention to treat were used 
for one drop-out. Demographic data was analyzed by chi-square test (for nominal data) and t-test (for 
interval data). The group and treatment effects (2 x 2) were analyzed by mixed two-way ANOVA with post 
hoc Bonferroni analysis. p<0.05 was statistically significant.

The SPSS 17.0 Windows version was used for satisfaction analysis. The satisfaction questionnaires 
include six main dimensions: Healthy Lifetype, System Environment Satisfaction, Perceived Usefulness, 
Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Satisfaction of System, and Attitude Toward Using. Healthy Lifetype, 
System Environment Satisfaction, and Perceived Satisfaction of System were analyzed by Mann-Whitney 
Test to compare the difference between telerehabilitation (Tele) group and conventional (Conv) group. 
Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Attitude Toward Using of Tele group were analyzed by 
description statistics. Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Attitude Toward Using also were 
analyzed by Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test to compare the difference between Tele group with value 3 to 
understand the context of satisfaction. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Healthy Lifetype, System Environment Satisfaction, and Perceived Satisfaction of System show no 
significant difference (P>0.05) between Tele group and Conv_1 group (RCT design) (Table 3). And there are 
no significant difference too (p>0.05) between Tele group and Conv_2 group (cross over design) (Table 4).  
Descriptive Statistics for Tele group in Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of use, Attitude toward using, 
and Perceived Satisfaction of system are shown in Table 5. All the mean values of Perceived Usefulness, 
Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude Toward Using, and Perceived Satisfaction of System are greater than 4. 
Moreover, Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude Toward Using, and Perceived Satisfaction of System show 
significant difference (p<0.05) between Tele group and value 3 (Table 6). Although Perceived Usefulness 
shows no significant difference (P>0.05) between Tele group and value 3 (Table 6) as well as the minimum 
value is 2 (Table 5), only one patient (20%) feels low Perceived Usefulness (score 2). Other four patients 
(80%) feel high Perceived Usefulness (score 5). In order to confirm the result, we double checked the 
original data of questionnaires. We found that the patient who had low Perceived Usefulness also showed 
negative answers for the other dimensions including Healthy Lifestype, and Environment Satisfaction. It 
shows that most patients were satisfied with the telerehabilitation system. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The results of the study suggest that telerehabilitation for home care is a feasible option for people 
moderately affected with stoke, and offer benefits such as improved physical activity levels.

Nowadays, since those people are under the high-pressure, overwork, overly nervous, less proper rest, 
and few exercises, some people often happen the Karoshi, death from overwork if one does not pay 
attention to healthily oneself. Therefore, in this study, we implement “Guardian”, which is a system that 
senses heart rate from the “sensor node” of one’s wrist watch, monitors ones’ fatigue index, and then sends 
out an alarm message to user with high fatigue index. The heart rate variability (HRV) can be gotten from 
the heart rate. Then, the ratio of power spectral density, called the fatigue index, between the sympathetic 
nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system can devised from the Berger algorithm. 
Simultaneously, this fatigue index can be transmitted to the control center by the ZigBee protocol for 
information collection and analysis. If one neglects this alarm signal, the officer can actively remind those 
people with high fatigue index to take rest and pay attention to his psychological state. Therefore, our 
system can effectively monitor up to 255 persons within one office and lower the probability of Karoshi.

一、參加會議經過:  
本會議是三天整, 聆聽論文報告者報告, 與研討關論文內容. 
 
二、與會心得:  
 
研習相關無線指紋感測與生醫應用平台: 近年來在國內外與遠距醫療或無線健康照護系統相關的
研究相當的蓬勃發展，包括將無線感測器的設計更人性化，訊號的偵測能夠連續而不中斷，訊號偵
測範圍能夠更廣；有研究則著重在硬體與通訊介面的整合，讓更多不同的醫療儀器所偵測到的生理
訊號能夠互相傳輸與整合到資料庫中，有的則是著重在通訊網路的架構設計，建構出適合生理訊號
擷取與傳送的架構，有的則是著重生理訊號量測工具的開發，讓病患在醫院的所有活動都能被連續
且確實的記錄下來。 
可以看出未來遠距醫療照護的趨勢，為提升病患的居家生活品質，在訊號量測的部分，無線通訊的
方式將取代傳統有線的量測工具或儀器。加上病患活動的範圍將不只侷限在建築物內，更遠的訊號傳
送距離將是必要的。 
 更進一步，在今日科技的進步下，晶片的速度越快與體積越小已是趨勢，而良好完善的高速數位
PCB 設計已是不可或缺的，傳統工程師靠經驗與反覆實驗的做法不僅耗時耗力，更無法掌握系統的可
靠度。我們習知一個高可靠度數位硬體平台開發流程，在電路設計時，便優先考慮系統中高速信號部
分的信號完整性問題。此一設計流程可以彌補電子工程師在設計時，因經驗或知識不足所造成的判斷
失誤，不僅可以大大的節省系統開發時間，更可以有效掌控系統的可靠度，提升整體性能。 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
 
四、建議:  
因應高穩定度無線生醫感測平台發展與應用的快速發展, 擬加強軟體、硬體、與韌體的高度整合。
