Abstract 
The photoinduced effects in phenanthrenequinone-doped (PQ-doped) poly(methyl 
methacrylate) (PMMA) photopolymer were studied by photoelastic modulation 
ellipsometry and polarimetry in real time.  The PQ-doped PMMA was exposed to an 
Ar/Kr tunable laser at the wavelength of 488 nm and measured by a HeNe laser at the 
wavelength of 633 nm. We separately measured the induced birefringence and the 
variation of the refractive index during exposure; there were three-orders-of-magnitude 
difference between these two effects. This suggested that the physical mechanism of 
holographic recording in PQ-doped PMMA was mainly due to the photoinduced variation in 
refractive index.  
Keywords: Ellipsometry, photoelastic modulator, Photo-induced polymer 
488 nm (Ar/Kr tunable laser): (A) PEM polarimetry for measuring the photo-induced 
birefringence; (B) PEM ellipsometry for measuring the refractive index changes. 
(A) Polarimetric configuration  
The configuration of the photoelastic modulated polarimetry is shown in Fig. 1.  The 
linear polarized light with azimuth angle at -45o passes through the PEM, whose phase is 
modulated by Δp and optic axis is at 0o, then transmits to the measured birefringence medium 
with retardation ΔQ and its optic axis is oriented at α.  If the azimuth angle of analyzer is set 
at 45o, the measured intensity can be proved to be: 
2 2
Q 0 p Q p QI(Δ ,α)=I [1-cosΔ (cosΔ cos 2α+sin 2α)+sinΔ sinΔ cos2α].    (1) 
After Fourier decomposition, one can prove the following for measuring ΔQ and α 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
B. PEM Ellipsometry configuration 
In this research, we also construct the photoelastic modulated ellipsometry to measure the 
photo-induced refractive index changes of a photorefractive polymer during illumination.  In 
the ellipsometric configuration, if its azimuth angles of P, optic axis of PEM and A are set as 
they are in the polarimetric configuration, the detected intensity can be expressed as [7]: 
  0I( , )=I [1-sin2 cos( )].pψ ψΔ Δ −Δ        (3) 
where ψ and Δ are the ellipsometric parameters of the sample and they are related by 
the following: 
  tan .pi
s
r
e
r
ρ ψ Δ= =           (4) 
where rp and rs represent the Fresnel complex- reflection coefficients of parallel and 
perpendicular components of the polarized light.  Using the same Fourier expansions in Eq. 
(3) for the modulated PEM, one can decompose the intensity in its harmonic components as:

The reflection coefficients were measured by the PEM ellipsometry, such as shown in Fig. 
2, which employed the probe beam at the incident angle of 60° on the normally irradiated 
sample. Because this incident direction is close to the Brewster angle, one can maximize the 
sensitivity of measurement.  For bulk model can be used to obtain the refractive index in real 
time, we specially fabricated this 1.92 mm thickness PQ-doped PMMA block to be in 
wedge-shaped to separate the multiple reflections. In addition to the PQ-doped PMMA, we 
measured the refractive index of a pure PMMA block exposed to the same inducing beam.  
IV. Results and future prospects  
  The induced α and ΔQ can be displayed on the monitor in real time, such as shown in 
Fig. 3-(a) and -(b).  It can be shown that the azimuth angle measured by this polarimetric 
model for isotropic medium should be 45o by Eq. (5).  From Fig. 3-(a), one can observe the 
process for the photoinduced birefringence of the PQ/PMMA in real time.  The azimuth of 
the optical axis of the photoinduced birefringence started from 43o (closed to be isotropic 
medium) then reached to 27.31° which is close to what was set for the azimuth of polarizer 
(P2).  In addition, the birefringence magnitude (Δn) can be calculated and shown in Fig. 3.  
Without using a polarizer in the inducing beam for observing the photorefractive process, we 
first measured the refractive index of a 1.88 mm thick PMMA block under normal irradiation 
of the Ar/Kr laser at the wavelength of 488 nm from t=200 sec to t=500 sec, the measured 
refractive index of the pure PMMA is 1.493 ± 3×10-3 for 632.8 nm wavelength, such as 
shown in Fig. 4, this result is comparable to that of the measurement in null ellipsometer [9].  
This phenomenon confirms that PQ-doped PMMA form a new adduct during exposure, since 
we did observe the refractive index changes from 1.497 to 1.487 when a PQ-doped PMMA 
under the illumination of 488 nm wave by the PEM ellipsometry, as shown in Fig. 4.  
  For anisotropic medium, multi-incident angles are needed to measure the optical axis 
and retardation.  If one like to observe both phenomenon, the ellipsometry should be 
modified as Fig. 5 [10].  The wave reflected from the beam splitter and mirror should be 
pre-calibrated in the system.

The azimuth angle (3-(a)) and the photoinduced phase retardation (3-(b)) of PQ-doped 
PMMA during exposure were measured in real time. After confirming the ambiguity m as 
expressed in Eq. (6), the birefringence magnitude Δn can be calculated as 3-(c). The 488-nm 
laser was turned on at t =22 sec

Abstract:  We propose to accomplish a polarization-coding device by using Photoelastic Modulator (PEM).  
After calibrating the initial phase of PEM, we can generate specific polarized light in 20μs without any 
moving part.  .

1. Introduction 
Having a fast polarization-coding device provides various applications: such as polarimetry, ellipsometry etc…  
Most polarization-coding devices contain at least one moving part ( for example: rotating quarter-wave plate ), 
which not only slows down the measurement process and can cause the beam to deviate (0.06°) during the 
implement.  In our system, we use the PEM to substitute the quarter-wave plate and forming a device without 
moving parts so to avoid defects.  PEM is an optical element that modulates the polarization state of light 
periodically with a high speed.  However, the high frequency modulated character becomes a barrier in acquiring 
specific polarization states.  Thus, we present a synchronizing technique to freeze the specific temporal phase.  
Via this technique, we can generate any desired polarized state in 20μs .

In measuring these states, the initial phase shift is clearly observable.  The phase correction does improve the 
precision of the generated polarization state.  
      
5. Conclusion 
A specific polarization-coding device, via the calibration of initial phase, is proposed.  Four specific polarization 
states (linear ±45˚, right-hand circular and left-hand circular), can be extracted in 20μsec, the stroboscopic 
illumination imaging ellipsometry can be realized.

In recent years there has been considerable interest in improving the measurement of the polarization state.  
However, beam deviation in rotating element ellipsometry can vary the angle of incidence(~0.06°), this will 
generate artificial errors and degrade the measuring quantity.  Thus, we synchronize the light source to the 
photoelastic modulator at 4 specific temporal phases, which are 0°, 30°, 90°,and 210°.  The ellipsometric parameters 
can be measured by the intensity at these four temporal phases [3], i.e. 
 
,     (3) 
 
 
Fig.1 the trajectory is the locus of the points of phase modulator with modulation amplitude set at 0.5. Those 
optimal 4 specific temporal points are the four specific polarization states.
