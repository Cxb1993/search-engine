關鍵詞：連體熱力學、虛功率原理、微連續體 
 
本計畫之主要目的乃是在過去的基礎上，更進一步地探索虛功率原理 (Principle 
of Virtual Power) 之應用性及完備性。首先，我們探討了具微連續體
(microcontinuum)性質之材料。由於材料科學與技術的快速進展，奈米尺度的材料
使用範圍已越來越廣。因為材料行為在奈米尺度時由量子或離散特性所支配，所
以其材料力學性質與巨觀尺度有著明顯的不同。迄今為止，我們尚未能對這些材
料建立一個完整合適的力學模型，但是為了描述這些材料的巨觀響應，已有數種
研究方法為人所提出，並經過了一些修正。Eringen 的微連續體理論就是因此需要
所發展出的一個優良參考模型。經過三年的努力，我們在連體力學的標準框架下
建立微連續體方程式。基於虛功率變分方程對剛體變分的不變性及熱動力學的
考量，可同時推導得微連續體之運動方程式及組成律。其次，我們亦利用變分組
成方程式推導得塑性體的組成律，因而擴展了虛功率原理的適用範圍。

Part I: On the Principle of Virtual Power for 
Microcontinuum 
It is noted that all volume integrals in Eq. (??) are valid for arbitrary volume V inside the body,
and hence the sum of the integrands vanishes,
(ρfB +∇·σ − ρr¨)·δ1v− (σ×˙1)·δ1ω + σ : δ1D+ ρθδ1s˙ (5)
− θ−1∇θ · δ1q = δ1(ρU˙ +RW ). (6)
At this stage, we invoke again the principle of material objectivity on δ1P, so that the functions of
U and RW must be invariant with respect to a rigid body translation or rotation. In other words,
δ1(ρU˙ + R
W ) must be independent of δ1v and δ1ω. We thus conclude that the basic variational
equation in local form (5) is necessarily and sufficiently satisfied by the following three equations
ρfB+∇·σ − ρv˙ = 0, (7)
σ×˙1 = 0, (8)
σ : δ1D+ ρθδ1s˙− θ−1∇θ · δ1q = δ1(ρU˙ +RW ). (9)
Virtual working
In the microscopic theory, the deformations of a microelement ∆B, having the volume ∆V with its
surface element ∆A, are described by the macromotion, X → x = xˆ(X, t), and the micromotion,
Ξ → ξ = ξˆ(X,Ξ, t). The two motions are mathemetically expressed by the deformation gradient
F and the deformable directors χ, which are defined by
x = F ·X, ξ = χ ·Ξ. (10)
In ∆B, the mass density and the specific body forces are denoted by ρ′ and fA′. First let’s consider
the virtual working of applied forces ∆(δ1WA) in the microelement ∆B
∆(δ1WA) =
∫
∆B
δ1(v + ξ˙) ·
[
dfA
′ − (v˙+ ξ¨)]ρ′dV ′,
which is the summation of the following four terms as
δ1v ·
∫
∆B
(
dfA
′ − v˙ρ′dV ′)+ ∫
∆B
δ1ξ˙ ·
(
dfA
′ − ξ¨ρ′dV ′)− δ1v · ∫
∆B
ξ¨ρ′dV ′ −
∫
∆B
δ1ξ˙ · v˙ρ′dV ′.
The last two terms vanish since that the operators δ1 and
∫
∆B are interchangeable and that the
following two relations ∫
∆B
ρ′ξdV ′ = 0, ξ˙ = ν · ξ, (11)
with the microgyration tensor ν(x, t), are held in the microcontinuum theory. The first relation in
(11) states that the first moment of inertia with respect to the point x in the microelement ∆B is
2
reversible processes for change of state of materials. In mechanical sense the most common state
variable is the mass density ρ, characterizing the compressibility of a body at a specific point x. To
take into account the compressibility of microcontinuum, being endowed with an inner structure at
point x, one could introduce, in addition to the mass density ρ, an additional quantity i with the
property of a second-order symmetric tensor, which is defined by
ρi∆V :=
∫
∆B
ρ′ξξdV ′. (18)
It is clear that i plays the similar role to that of moment of inertia for a rigid body, thus is called
microinertia tensor. The two variables, ρ and i, are the suitable candidates as the independent
field variables of the internal energy function U . However, the evolution equations for the two
field quantities cannot be determined from the proposed variational principle, and then we should
propose them, independent of the principle, from other means, e.g., the concepts of balance of mass
and balance of microinertia, which lead to
ρ˙ + ρ∇ · v = 0, (19)
i˙− ν · i− i · νT = 0. (20)
On the other hand, RW characterizes irreversible responses of materials and it is a function of states
variables as well as rate variables, which should be chosen according to what the dissipative mecha-
nisms would be described and what the materials would be modelled. The following two categories
are discussed in this work to explicate the different presentations in the choices of kinematic rate
variables.
Microcontinuous fluids
The suitable kinematic rate variables should be associated with the material time derivatives of
strain measures of microcontinuum. The detailed discussion can be found in the book of Eringen [4],
in which the kinematic rate variables for fluids are the objective deformation-rate tensors a, b, and
c. The second-order tensors a and c and the third-order tensor b are defined by
a := (∇v− ν)T , 2c := ν + (ν)T , b := ∇ν, (21)
and they are related to the material time derivatives of the deformation tensor Cˆ, the microdefor-
mation tensor C¯, and the wryness tensor Γ by
˙ˆ
C = FT · a · χ−T , ( ˙ˆCKL = xk,Kaklχ−1Ll ), (22)
˙¯C = 2FT · c · χ, ( ˙¯CKL = 2xk,KcklχlL), (23)
Γ˙ = χ−1 · b · ·χF, (Γ˙KLM = χ−1KkbklmχlLxm,M ). (24)
4
then, with the use of (31), equation (32) can be reduced to
ρ(l−ψ) +∇ ·m+ σT = s. (34)
It should be noted that from a single variational principle we have derived the six equations
for microcontinuum fluids, two (30) and (34) for the balance equations and four (28), (29), (31),
and (33) for the constitutive equations. From another approach with the concept of invariance
of total energy under rigid body transformations (cf. [4]), only the balance equations can be
obtained. The constitutive equations should be achieved by an extra introduction of the concept of
thermodynamics.
We remark further that the balance equation of energy cannot be directly obtained by this vari-
ational principle, it still can be obtained from the consideration of the first law of thermodynamics
as follows. It is known that the time rate change of total energy of the body is equal to the sum of
working and heating exerting on the body, thus we have
d
dt
∫
B
ρUdV =
∫
V
{[
ρ(l−ψ) +∇ ·m] : ν + [ρ(f − v˙) +∇ ·σ] · v +m:˙(∇ν) + σ : (∇v)T}dV
+
∫
V
(∇ · q+ qb)dV. (35)
Here the general applied working, analogous to the expression of the virtual applied working in
(17), is adopted so that the kinetic energy is expelled from the total energy. For arbitrary volume
element, it follows that
ρU˙ = s : ν +m:˙(∇ν) + σT : ((∇v)− ν)+∇ · q+ qb, (36)
where the balance equations for momentum and moments of momentum, (30) and (34), have been
used.
It seems that the drawback of this principle is lacking of boundary conditions associated with
the balance equations.
Microcontinuous solids
For microcontinous solids one of choices for the kinematic variables is the set composed of the
deformation tensor Cˆ, the microdeformation tensor C¯, and the wryness tensor Γ. The three tensors
are all objective tensors and their relationships with the deformation-rate tensors a, b, and c have
been shown in (22). We assume that the state space of the internal energy function is the set
(Cˆ, C¯,Γ, s) and the dissipating function depends on q, i.e.,
U = Uˆ (Cˆ, C¯,Γ, s), RW = RˆW (q).

This result is identical to the inverse of stress rate relation determined from ˆU  in Eq. (9).  
The fourth rank tensor ijklC  is known to have only 2 independent components with

Since σ  changes its sign from positive to negative as the applied force changes from the 
case of loading to unloading, the value of ˆ GR  and hence that dε  thus fluctuates between 
positive and negative accordingly. The constitutive relation determined from the linear term 
as in the previous equation is then inherently unstable, and is usually discarded on physical 
ground.  
1. 0β =  for unloading after yielding and neutral loading; 
2. 1β =  for loading after yielding.                       (19)                
The previous restriction is entirely based upon the second law of thermodynamics, upon 
which the variational constitutive equation is based, that ˆWR , and hence, ˆGR  must be 
positive and definite ( ˆ 0WR ≥ ). Experimentally, in simple tension or shear tests of metal 
specimen, if the loading is stopped after yielding and switched to unloading, the deformation 
of the metal specimen behavior is also switched from plastic deformation to elastic until the 
load is totally released( 0=σ ), leaving some permanent plastic strain in the specimen. It is 
reassuring that the previous restriction on β  for the case of unloading is in total agreement 
with experimental observations. 
    In this approximation, the dependence of dε on the stress rate dσ  because the 
coefficients of expansion ( )ijα σ  is evaluated at the current state of deformation. In other 
words, the argument σ  is changing from time to time while the stress is increasing, and its 
value is determined from the time integral of stress rate,

In Eq. (21), the stiffness coefficient 0ijklS  is a material constant at natural state 
( 0, 0= =σ ε ) which is either known or measurable experimentally. On the other hand, the 
dissipative coefficient ijα  is still an unspecified function of stress at the current time t.  
This expression is nearly useless, as is, because ijα  is an tensorial function in six different
