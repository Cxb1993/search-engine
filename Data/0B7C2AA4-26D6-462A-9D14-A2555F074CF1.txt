Abstract 
This paper develops an intelligent robust control 
algorithm for a class of uncertain nonlinear multivariable 
systems by using sliding model technology. The proposed 
control algorithm consists of an adaptive recurrent cerebellar 
model articulation controller (RCMAC) and a robust 
controller. The adaptive RCMAC is a main tracking 
controller utilized to mimic an ideal sliding mode controller, 
and the parameters of the adaptive RCMAC are on-line 
tuned by the derived adaptive laws from the Lyapunov 
function. Based on the   ∞H control approach, the robust 
controller is employed to efficiently suppress the influence 
of residual approximation error between the ideal sliding 
mode controller and the adaptive RCMAC, so that the robust 
tracking performance of the system can be guaranteed. 
Finally, computer simulation results on a three-link robot 
manipulator are performed to verify the effectiveness and 
feasibility of the proposed control algorithm. The simulation 
results confirm that the developed control algorithm not only 
can guarantee the system stability but also achieve an 
excellent robust tracking performance.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In recent year, controls of uncertain nonlinear systems 
have been one of active research topics for many control 
engineering. Various control efforts have been utilized to 
design and analysis the uncertain nonlinear systems. Sliding 
mode control (SMC) has been confirmed as a powerful 
robust scheme for controlling the nonlinear systems with 
uncertainties [1], [2]. The most outstanding features of SMC 
are insensitive to system parameter variations, fast dynamic 
response and external disturbance rejection [1]. However, in 
practical applications, SMC suffers two main disadvantages 
[2]. One is that it requires the system models that may be 
difficult to obtain in some cases. The other is that because 
the magnitude of uncertainty bound is unknown, the 
largeuncertainty bound is often required to achieve robust 
characteristics; however, this will lead the control input 
chattering. 
Cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) is 
classified as a non-fully connected perceptron-like 
associative memory network with overlapping 
receptive-fields [10]; and it intends to resolve the fast 
size-growing problem and the learning difficult in currently 
available types of neural networks (NNs). Comparing to 
neural networks, CMACs possess good generalization 
capability, fast learning ability and simple computation [10], 
[3]. This network has already been shown to be able to 
approximate a nonlinear function over a domain of interest 
to any desired accuracy [4]-[7]. For the reasons, CMACs 
have adopted widely for the closed-loop control of complex 
dynamical systems in recent literatures [7]-[10]. However, 
the major drawback of existing CMACs is that their 
application domain is limited to static problem due to their

where ) ,...., ,.... ,( 1 mi σσσdiag=σ . However, in practical 
applications, the dynamical functions are not precisely 
known, and the lumped uncertainty is always unknown. 
Therefore, the ideal sliding mode controller in (12) is 
unobtainable. Thus, an intelligent robust control algorithm 
based on RCMAC and sliding model technology is proposed 
in the following section to achieve robust tracking 
performance. 
IV.  INTELLIGENT ROBUST CONTROL SYSTEM 
The configuration of the intelligent robust control 
algorithm, which consists of an adaptive RCMAC and a 
robust controller, is depicted in Fig. 1. The control system is 
assumed to take the following form: 
RCARCMACt uuu +=)(  (13) 
where ARCMACu  is an adaptive RCMAC and RCu  is a robust 
controller. The adaptive RCMAC ARCMACu  is a main 
tracking controller utilized to mimic the ideal sliding mode 
controller. The robust controller RCu  is employed to 
efficiently suppress the influence of residual approximation 
error between the ideal sliding mode controller and adaptive 
RCMAC, so that the robust tracking performance of the 
system can be guaranteed. 
A. Description of RCMAC  
An RCMAC is proposed and shown in Fig. 2, in 
which   T denotes a time delay. This RCMAC is composed 
of input space, association memory space with recurrent 
weights, receptive-field space, weight memory space and 
output space. The signal propagation and the basic function 
in each space are described as follows. 
1) Input space I : For a given a
a
nT
nppp ℜ∈= ],,,[ 21 Lp , 
where an  is the number of input state variables, each input 
state variable   ip must be quantized into discrete regions 
(called elements) according to given control space. The 
number of elements, en , is termed as a resolution.  
2) Association memory space A : Several elements can be 
accumulated as a block, the number of blocks, bn , is usually 
greater than or equal to two. A  denotes an association 
memory space with cn  ( bac nnn ×= ) components. In this 
space, each block performs a receptive-field basis function, 
the Gaussian function is adopted here as the receptive-field 
basis function, which can be represented as

where   ikμ represents the output of the k-th receptive-field 
basis function for the i-th input with the mean   ikc and 
variance  . ikv In addition, the input of this block can be 
represented as 
)()()( Ttrtptp ikikirik −+= μ  (15) 
where ikr  is the recurrent weight, and )( Ttik −μ denotes the 
value of   ikμ through delay time T . Figure 3 depicts the 
schematic diagram of a two-dimensional RCMAC with 
5=en  and 4=fn  ( fn  is the number of elements in a 
complete block); in which 1p  is divided into blocks 1aB  
and 1bB , and 2p  is divided into blocks 2aB  and 2bB . By 
shifting each variable an element, different blocks will be 
obtained. For instance, blocks 1cB  and 1dB  for 1p , and 
blocks 2cB  and 2dB  for 2p  are possible shifted elements. 
Each block in this space has three adjustable parameters ikc , 
ikv  and ikr . 
3) Receptive-field space R : Areas formed by blocks, 
referred to as 21 aa BB  and 21 bb BB  are called receptive-fields. 
The number of receptive-fields, , dn is equal to bn  in this 
study. The k-th multi-dimensional receptive-field function is

Abstract:  
The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) is a 
nonlinear adaptive system with built-in simple computation, 
good generalization capability and fast learning property. In 
this paper, an adaptive intelligent backstepping tracking 
control (AIBTC) system combined with adaptive CMAC and 
∞H  control technique is proposed for a class of chaotic 
systems. In the proposed control system, an adaptive 
backstepping cerebellar model articulation controller 
(ABCMAC) is used to mimic an ideal backstepping control 
(IBC), and a robust controller is designed to attenuate the 
effect of the residual approximation errors and external 
disturbances with desired attenuation level. Moreover, the all 
adaptation laws of the AIBTC system are derived based on the 
Lyapunov stability analysis and ∞H  control theory, so that 
the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. 
Finally, two application examples are used to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of proposed control technique. 
Keywords: 
Cerebellar model articulation controller; Intelligent 
control; Backstepping control; Adaptive control 
1. Introduction 
The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) 
is a type of associative memory neural network inspired by 
the neurophysiologic theory of the cerebellum, first 
introduced by Albus has been proposed in the literature [1, 
2]. The advantages of using CMAC over neural network in 
many practical applications have been presented in recent 
literatures [3, 4]. The conventional CMAC uses local 
constant binary receptive-field basis functions. For 
acquiring the derivative information of input and output 
variables, Chiang and Lin developed a CMAC with 
non-constant differentiable Gaussian receptive-field basis 
function, and provided the convergence analyses of this 
network [5]. This proves CMACs are suitable for 
controlling the nonlinear dynamic systems. 
Chaotic phenomena can be found in many scientific 
and engineering fields such as biological systems, 
electronic circuits, power converters, chemical systems, and 
so on [6]. Since the pioneering work of Ott, Grebogi, and 
Yorke [7] proposed the well-known OGY control method, 
the control of chaotic systems has been widely studied. 
Recently, numerous backstepping control design procedures 
have been proposed to achieve chaotic control [8-10]. The 
key idea of backstepping design is to select recursively 
some appropriate functions of state variables as fictitious 
control inputs for lower dimension subsystems of the 
overall system [11-13]. 
For some chaotic systems, since the dynamic 
characteristics of the control system are nonlinear and the 
precise models are difficult to obtain, the model-based 
control approaches are difficult to be implemented. To 
overcome this drawback, an AIBTC system has been 
proposed for uncertain nonlinear chaotic systems.  
2. Backstepping control system 
For simplification, we only consider third-order 
uncertain nonlinear chaotic systems, but the approach can 
be generalized to high-order systems. The uncertain 
nonlinear chaotic system is described as

accumulated as a block, the number of blocks, . In this 
space, each block performs a receptive-field basis function, 
which can be defined as rectangular [1, 2] or triangular or 
any continuously bounded function [3-5, 15, 16]. The 
Gaussian function is adopted here as the receptive-field 
basis function

If the system starts with initial conditions , 0E =)0(

attenuation constant δ  can be specified by the designer to 
achieve desired attenuation ratio between  and |||| 3e |||| ξ . 
If ∞=δ , this is the case of minimum error tracking control 
without disturbance attenuation [18]. Then, the desired 
robust tracking performance in (46) can be achieved for a 
prescribed attenuation level δ .

demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the 
proposed AIBTC system. The adaptive CMAC used in 
these examples is characterized by 4=ρ , ,

chosen as . The initial values of 
the parameters for the receptive-field basis functions are
