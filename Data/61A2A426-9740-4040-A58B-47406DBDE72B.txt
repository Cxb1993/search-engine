suggested some practical shapes for the blades. 
Maalawi and Negm [3] proposed an objective 
function that was a composite function of several 
natural frequencies for a turbine blade, and 
maximized this function to achieve the goal of 
decreasing steady state and transient responses. 
Díaz Casás et al. [4, 5] investigated a turbine blade 
aerodynamic problem in a form of multi 
-disciplinary optimization, using an evolutionary 
-based procedure. Jureczko et al. [6] combined the 
finite element method and genetic algorithm to 
minimize the weight of a turbine blade, with stress 
and blade tip displacement as constraints. Vitale 
and Rossi [7] developed a blade design program, 
based on the blade element theory (BET), to 
calculate the optimal aerodynamic blade shape of a 
rotor that would generate the requested power 
output, with the blade number, airfoil curves and 
wind field mean speed as inputs. Several technical 
reports (Malcolm and Hansen [8], Bir and 
Migliore [9], Griffin [10]) provide valuable 
information for large scale composite blade 
design. 
 This project proposes a two-step procedure to 
produce blade designs that are optimal both in 
aerodynamics and in structure. The result of the 
first step is the optimum cord lengths and twist 
angles of airfoils of the blade cross-sections along 
the blade spanwise direction. The second step 
provides optimal material distribution for the 
composite blade, while the stress is kept within 
preset design stresses and the natural frequencies 
of the blade well separated from the rotor’s rated 
speed, and the mass of the blade minimized. To 
achieve the objectives, a wind field simulation 
program, TurbSim, and a wind turbine dynamics 
code, FAST, are utilized to perform simulation. 
The maximum loads on the turbine blade are 
extracted and applied to a parameterized finite 
element model of a blade created in the ANSYS 
environment, and then the composite blade model 
is optimized. The two-step procedure is 
demonstrated on a 3 MW, three-blade, horizontal 
-axis, upwind wind turbine, whose blades have 
cross-sections of NREL airfoil types: S818, S825 
and S826.    
 
2. Two-step procedure for wind turbine blade 
design 
The first step of this two-step procedure 
follows the blade design scheme suggested by 
Manwell et al. [11]. Assume that the following 
parameters are known: radius of the rotor R, 
number of blades of the rotor N, designed lift 
coefficient CLd for a particular airfoil, and the 
designed angle of attack d of the airfoil. Define  
as the angular speed of the rotor and the tip speed 
ratio  as the ratio of the blade tip speed of the 
rotor (R) to the mean wind speed in free stream 
(V). For any given designed tip speed ratio d, the 
cord length distribution of the airfoil along the 
blade spanwise has the form 
 r

R

and r is called the local tip speed ratio at position 
r, r the local inflow angle. The local twist angle 
of the airfoil at position r is given as 
drr                  (3) 
A rotor having blades with airfoils whose chord 
lengths and twist angles arranged according to Eqs. 
(1) and (3) will yield a maximum power output. 
Once the outer shape of the blade is determined, 
the material allocation of the composite blade can 
be decided in the second stage. 
 By setting the stress and frequency 
constraints and a minimum blade mass as the 
design objective, the structural optimization 
problem in the second phase can be defined as 
follows:

where mT is the total mass of one blade; t and c 
the maximum tensile and minimum compressive 
stresses in the spanwise direction, respectively; dt 
the design tensile stress and dc the design 
compressive stress; fi, i=1, …, s the ith natural 
frequency of the blade and s the number of modes 
considered; fr the wind turbine’s rated rotor speed; 
Fms the minimum frequency separation specified; 
xj, j=1, …, l the design variables with l the number 
of design variables; and XjU and XjL the upper and 
lower bounds, respectively, of the design variables. 
Since the composite structure of the blade was 
treated macroscopically to simplify the problem, 
only tensile and compressive stresses were

simulated wind at the center of the hub in the 
direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation of 
the rotor (Vx), using IEC normal turbulence model 
with the Kaimal spectrum and Type A turbulence 
characteristic. A wind turbine dynamics code, 
FAST (Jason and Marshall [14]), was utilized to 
perform wind turbine simulation. Figure 5(b) 
shows the generator output power of the turbine. 
During operation, an active control was turned on 
to retain the rotor’s rated speed and therefore the 
rated power. In Figure 5 and thereafter, 600 
seconds of time history were simulated, but the 
first 100 seconds were excluded to eliminate the 
initial effects and the rest 500 seconds of time 
series analyzed.

4. Result of optimization procedure step one 
 To achieve the optimum aerodynamic shape design for the blades using Eqs. (1) through (3), 
the designed lift coefficient CLd for a particular 
airfoil has to be established first. The lift 
coefficient CL of an airfoil is a function of the

and aerodynamic forces applied to the blade 
segments. There are 20 blade segments defined by 
those 21 cross-sections, and the moments, forces 
and accelerations were assumed to be applied to 
the centers of the segments. Time histories of 600 
seconds of everything at all 20 segment centers 
were simulated. Figure 7 depicts the time histories 
between the 100 and 200 seconds of three 
acceleration components (Ax, Ay and Az) and three 
moments (Mx, My and Mz) acting on segment 1, 
which is defined as the portion between 
cross-sections 1 and 2, while Figure 8 displays two 
aerodynamic forces (Fn and Ft). For the 
aerodynamic forces, the normal component Fn is in 
the direction normal to the plane of rotation and 
likewise for the tangential component Ft (Laino 
and Hansen [16]). Some quantities are apparently 
influenced by the rotor speed, which is 0.242 cps, 
as shown in Figures 7(d), 7(e), 7(f) and 8(b). 
Multiplied by the mass of each segment, the 
accelerations lead to inertia forces acting on each 
segment. To simulate the extreme case that all the 
forces and moments at all 13 segments attain their 
maximum values at exactly the same time, the 
maximum values of the forces and moments were 
extracted from the histories, and then these forces 
and moments were simultaneously applied to the 
blade finite element model that will be described 
in the next subsection.

tangential directions, experienced by segment 1 
 
5.2 Finite element modeling for the turbine blade 
Parameterized finite element models of the 
aerodynamically optimized blades, with their 
circular-shaped blade root fixed as the boundary 
condition, was created using the ANSYS software. 
Figure 9(a) shows the solid model of blade Model 
D and Figure 9(b) displays its finite element grid. 
Also, Figure 10(a) illustrates the solid model of 
Model C while Figure 10(b) shows more clearly 
from another viewing angle the airfoil sections 
with various chord lengths and twist angles. The 
finite element model composes of multilayer shell 
elements (SHELL99) for both the blade wall and 
box-spar reinforcement, and of multipoint 
constraint elements (MPC184) for connecting the 
center nodes of the 20 segments to their respective 
cross-sectional perimeters. As for the material 
models used, since there are 4 material models for 
each blade segment (Figure 4), 80 composite 
material models for the shell elements were 
defined overall. The maximum forces and 
moments were applied to those center nodes 
before a static finite element analysis was 
performed. In addition, modal analysis was also 
carried out to extract the blade’s natural 
frequencies and mode shapes. In order to have a 
clear look inside the blade models, Figure 11 
depicts the finite elements belonged to the lower 
half of the model.

histories of the 5 design variables. During the 
structural optimization process, stress analysis and 
modal analysis of the blade model were repeated 
to acquire the maximum tensile and compressive 
stresses in the model and the natural frequencies of 
the blade. Figure 12(c) demonstrates the iteration 
histories of the maximum tensile and compressive 
stresses while the frequency difference between 
the first natural frequency of the blade and the 
rotor speed is given in Figure 12(d). Finally, 
Figure 12(e) depicts the iteration of the total mass 
of the blade, i.e. the objective function. Initially, 
the blade model was an infeasible design. As the 
design variables were adjusting, the total mass of 
the blade began to grow, fluctuate, and then settle 
down. Figure 13 displays the stress distribution of 
the optimized blade Model D, and Figure 14 
shows the first four natural frequencies and their 
corresponding mode shapes.

6. Conclusions 
This paper has presented a two-step 
procedure for the optimum design of composite 
wind turbine blades. A 3 MW, three-blade, 
horizontal-axis, upwind wind turbine with blades 
having cross-sections of NREL S818, S825 and 
S826 airfoil types was demonstrated as the design 
example. The result of the first step is the optimum 
cord lengths and twist angles of airfoils of the 
blade cross-sections along the blade spanwise 
direction. Generally, the aerodynamically 
optimized chord lengths and twist angles are larger 
near the blade root and sequentially diminish when 
approaching the blade tip. A parameterized finite 
element model of the aerodynamically optimized 
blade was created using the ANSYS software. A 
full-field turbulence with a mean speed of 25 m/s 
was simulated and applied to the wind turbine to 
produce time series of accelerations, moments and 
aerodynamic forces acting on the blade segments. 
Subsequently, the maximum values of the forces 
and moments were extracted and then 
simultaneously imposed to the blade finite element 
model to replicate the extreme case. The second 
step provides optimal material distribution for the

Abstract 
Modern large wind turbines, utilized to harness the kinetic energy of the wind, are rated at megawatts in output 
power. The design of large wind turbine blades must consider both their aerodynamic efficiency and structural 
robustness. This paper presents a two-step procedure for the optimum design of composite wind turbine blades. 
The results of the first step are the aerodynamically optimal cord lengths and twist angles of airfoils for the 
blade cross-sections along the blade spanwise direction. The second step yields optimal material distribution for 
the composite blade. A 3 MW wind turbine with blades having cross-sections of NREL S818, S825 and S826 
airfoil types is demonstrated as the design example. Loaded by maximum forces and moments extracted from 
simulated time series, a parameterized finite element model of the aerodynamically optimized blade is created 
using the ANSYS software. The optimization results show that the initial blade model is an infeasible design due 
to a high level of the maximum stress, exceeding the upper limit of the stress constraint, but eventually the 
process converges to a feasible solution with the expense of increased total mass of the blade.  
1 Introduction 
Wind power has been one of the fastest growing renewable energy technologies throughout the world in recent 
years. Wind turbines, which are used to harness the kinetic energy of the wind, have two basic configurations: 
horizontal axis and vertical axis. Modern large wind turbines with output rated at megawatts (MW) 
predominantly have a horizontal axis. A horizontal-axis wind turbine equips a rotor (generally with two or three 
blades), a nacelle (housing the rotor shaft, gearbox, generator, electrical switch boxes and control systems), and a 
turbine tower. Based on the relative position of the rotor to the wind direction, horizontal-axis wind turbines can 
be further classified as upwind or downwind ones. A turbine rotor is made of a hub, a rotor shaft and blades that 
have good aerodynamic characteristics. For large wind turbines, turbine blades are usually made from composite 
materials to reduce the weight while attaining a reasonable strength to weight ratio. The design of large wind 
turbine blades must consider both their aerodynamic efficiency and structural robustness. Besides the circular 
shape at the blade root, the cross-sections along the spanwise direction of a blade have the shapes of airfoils. 
Early designs of wind turbine blades utilized airfoils intended originally for airplanes, such as the NACA series.

where mT is the total mass of one blade; σt and σc the maximum tensile and minimum compressive stresses in the 
spanwise direction, respectively; σdt the design tensile stress and σdc the design compressive stress; fi, i=1, …, s 
the ith natural frequency of the blade and s the number of modes considered; fr the wind turbine’s rated rotor 
speed; Fms the minimum frequency separation specified; xj, j=1, …, l the design variables with l the number of 
design variables; and XjU and XjL the upper and lower bounds, respectively, of the design variables. Since the 
composite structure of the blade was treated macroscopically to simplify the problem, only tensile and 
compressive stresses were considered in the above formulation. The design stresses can be linked to the 
materials’ ultimate strengths by σdt=σut/nfs and σdc=σuc/nfs, where σut and σuc are the composite materials’ 
ultimate tensile and compressive stresses, respectively, and nfs is total factor of safety, accounting for the general 
effect and the effects from aging, temperature, resin infusion and  post-cure (Germanischer [5]).   
3 Design example of a 3 MW wind turbine 
A three-blade, horizontal-axis, upwind wind turbine with a rated power of 3 MW, which is a modified version of 
a 3 MW turbine proposed by Malcolm and Hansen [14] and uses a scale-up version of a 20.15 m long blade in 
Bir and Migliore [1], was chosen as the design example. The turbine has a rotor with a diameter of 93.3 m and 
rated speed of 14.5 rpm, and a tilted rotor shaft of 5°. Also, the height of the rotor hub is 119 m. Each rotor blade, 
which is 44.175 m long, has a circular cross-section from its root attaching the rotor hub to the 1.753-meter span 
location. Then the circular blade cross-sections gradually transition to airfoil sections that have NREL airfoil 
types S818 at the 9.648-meter span location, S825 at 32.667-meter and S826 at 41.873-meter and 44.175-meter 
(at the blade tip). Figure 1 shows the NREL types of airfoils normalized by their cord lengths. Table 1 details the 
14 cross-sections framing the blade. The section numbers 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 in Table 1 are hybrid airfoils of the 
three basic types with different weighting factors to ensure proper transitions between two basic shapes. The 
hollow rotor blades are made of composite materials with box-spar reinforcement. Figure 2 illustrates that the 
blade is composed of double-bias (DB), unidirectional, core and lining materials, and covered by an exterior 
coating of gelcoat with a layer of Nexus providing a smooth but absorbent surface in between for the painting of 
the gelcoat. Also shown in Figure 2 are four different material models describing various parts of a blade cross-
section. Table 2 lists the mechanical properties of the blade materials.

In this study, the wind turbine is undergone a turbulence with a mean wind speed of 25 m/s, which is 
assumed to be the maximum operation wind speed also known as the cut-out speed. TurbSim (Jonkman and 
Buhl [8]), a full-field stochastic simulation program, was used to simulate the turbulence. Figure 3(a) displays 
the simulated wind at the center of the hub in the direction perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the rotor (Vx),

of the angle of attack, and so is the drag coefficient CD. The coefficient CLd can be so determined that its 
corresponding angle of attack maximizes the ratio of CL/CD. An airfoil aerodynamics program, XFoil (Drela [4]), 
was employed to calculate the aerodynamic properties of the airfoils considered, and then a MATLAB script was 
coded to find the maximum ratio.  The lift to drag ratios for the airfoil sections of the blade (sections 6 through 
14 shown in Table 1) are plotted against the angles of attack as demonstrated in Figure 4. Since the airfoil shapes 
for sections no. 13 and 14 are the same, i.e. S826, they share the plot as in Figure 4(h). In executing the 
calculations using XFoil, a Reynolds number of 3×106 was assumed for all cases. The maximum lift to drag 
ratios CLd/CD were found and are displayed in Table 3 along with their corresponding angles of attack α*, lift 
and drag coefficients. 
 Following the determination scheme for chord and twist angle distribution of the aerodynamically 
optimal blade, the local tip speed ratio λr, inflow angle φr, twist angle βr and cord length cr at difference sections 
are given in Table 4, with the designed tip speed ratio λd set to 8. Note that sections 1 through 5 have circular 
shapes with a diameter of 2.474 m and they assume the same twist angle as section 6 to facilitate the finite 
element modeling of the blade in the latter stage. The blade has larger chord lengths and twist angles for airfoil 
sections near the root and, except for section 12, sequentially diminishing chords and angles for sections 
approaching the blade tip.

3.2.2 Finite element modeling for the turbine blade 
A parameterized finite element model of the aerodynamically optimized blade, with its circular-shaped blade 
root fixed as the boundary condition, was created using the ANSYS software. Figure 7(a) shows the solid model 
of the blade and Figure 7(b) displays more clearly from another viewing angle the airfoil sections with various 
chord lengths and twist angles. The finite element model composes of 8476 multilayer shell elements (SHELL99) 
for both the blade wall and box-spar reinforcement, and of 78 multipoint constraint elements (MPC184) for 
connecting the center nodes of the 13 segments to their respective cross-sectional perimeters. As for the material 
models used, since there are 4 material models for each blade segment (Figure 2), 52 composite material models 
for the shell elements were defined overall. The maximum forces and moments were applied to those center 
nodes before a static finite element analysis was performed. In addition, modal analysis was also carried out to 
extract the blade’s natural frequencies and mode shapes. In order to have a clear look inside the blade model, 
Figure 7(c) illustrates the finite elements belonged to the lower half of the model.

3.2.3 Structural optimization for the turbine blade 
The structural optimization problem, defined by Eqs. 4 through 8, was solved using ANSYS Parametric Design 
Language (APDL) with the first order optimization method under the ANSYS environment. When the first order 
optimization method is executed, the constrained optimization problem is transformed into an unconstrained one 
via penalty functions and derivatives are approximated using a forward difference approach. Exterior and 
extended interior penalty functions (Kirsch [10]) are applied, respectively, to the side constraints on the design 
variables and to the rest of the constraints. To form the search direction, the steepest descent method is used for 
the initial iteration, and conjugate directions are generated according to the Polak-Ribiere recursion formula 
(More and Wright [15]) for subsequent iterations. Moreover, the line search variable in the unconstrained 
optimization problem is solved by using a combination of a golden section algorithm and a local quadratic fitting 
technique. 
The constants and upper and lower limits in the optimization problem were set as follows: the total factor 
of safety nfs=2.21 (Germanischer [5]), σut=151 MPa, σdt=σut/nfs=68.33 MPa, σuc= -174 MPa, σdc=σuc/nfs= -78.73

4 Conclusions 
This paper has presented a two-step procedure for the optimum design of composite wind turbine blades. A 3 
MW, three-blade, horizontal-axis, upwind wind turbine with blades having cross-sections of NREL S818, S825 
and S826 airfoil types was demonstrated as the design example. The result of the first step is the optimum cord 
lengths and twist angles of airfoils of the blade cross-sections along the blade spanwise direction. Generally, the 
aerodynamically optimized chord lengths and twist angles are larger near the blade root and sequentially 
diminish when approaching the blade tip. A parameterized finite element model of the aerodynamically 
optimized blade was created using the ANSYS software. A full-field turbulence with a mean speed of 25 m/s 
was simulated and applied to the wind turbine to produce time series of accelerations, moments and aerodynamic 
forces acting on the blade segments. Subsequently, the maximum values of the forces and moments were 
extracted and then simultaneously imposed to the blade finite element model to replicate the extreme case. The 
second step provides optimal material distribution for the composite blade. The results have shown that the 
initial blade model was an infeasible design due to a high level of the maximum stress, exceeding the upper limit 
of the stress constraint, but eventually the process converged to a feasible solution with the expense of increased 
total mass of the blade.
