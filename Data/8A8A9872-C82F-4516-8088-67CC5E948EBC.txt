點，使其逐漸成為世界各國無人飛行載具研發之重
點[14-17]。小型無人飛行載具的運用範圍及功能
性，其成敗係決定於所攜帶的任務裝備；而酬載為
其選擇任務裝備之最重要的關鍵。載人飛機安裝前
置翼(canard)具有增加飛機升力、提升飛行操控性
等優點，然而卻使得飛機靜態穩定性下降及增加飛
機結構的重量，則是前置翼可能造成的缺點
[18-21]。為了進一步提高酬載能力，本研究擬擷取
「前置翼提供額外升力可增加酬載、無形中使任務
裝備選擇性提高」之特點，進行前置翼無人飛行載
具設計發展。 
 
2. 無人飛行載具設計 
2.1 設計概要 
本研究係延續 2009 年發展之小型無人飛行載
具為基礎[22]，加上參考載人飛機前置翼設計可提
供額外升力之特性，採用載人飛機前置翼設計方法
及結合 AAA 飛機設計軟體，建立前置翼小型無人
飛行載具設計方法，設計流程如圖 1 所示；並藉由
前置翼設計及靜態穩定參數計算與分析之過程，使
得研製之無人飛行載具具備高酬載能力及較佳飛
行操控性，可縮短研製時及降低成本；本研究首先
依 2009 年小型無人載具任務規範為基礎及表 1 所
列之全球 14 款 10 至 99 磅等級無人飛行載具所建
立之酬載與起飛總重比值平均值參數，用以建立起
飛總重、燃油重量與空重等設計參數；接下來再由
各項任務需求建立之起飛翼面負載（W/S）與起飛
馬力負載（W/P）的關係圖，評估採用 2009 年原型
機之機身尺寸、機翼外形、翼剖面等設計參數之可
行性，並進一步探討加裝前置翼之氣動力性能，以
期可達高酬載與操控穩定靈活之目標。 
 
2.2 任務規範 
本研究以 2009 年小型無人載具任務規範
(mission specification)為基礎並採用低單翼設計，僅
更動酬載設計目標值，使其可具有 10 磅至 99 磅重
量等級無人飛行載具酬載與起飛總重比值平均值 2
倍之高酬載能力。 
本研究前置翼無人飛行載具任務規範如下： 
(1)酬載： 約 9.5 公斤重。 
(2)航程：維持原有規範之 2500 公尺及飛完航程需
存留 25%的燃油。 
(3)高度：維持原規範之巡航高度 150 公尺及最高可
達 350 公尺。 
(4)巡航速率：維持原有規範之無酬載狀態下為 40
公里/時及高酬載全馬力狀態下為 60 公里/時。 
(5)爬升：維持原有規範之自海平面爬升至 150 公
尺，巡航三分鐘，再降落。 
(6)起降：維持原有規範之慣用的跑道起飛降落。 
(7)推進系統：維持原有規範之 90 級模型飛機專用
引擎。 
依參考文獻[23-24]及本研究前置翼無人飛行
載具設計方法，由任務規範訂定本研究之任務剖面
如圖 2 所示，區分為七個階段： 
第一階段(引擎啟動及溫機)，使用時間約為兩分鐘。 
第二階段(滑行)，加速至全馬力之速度，滑行距離
約 80 公尺。 
第三階段(起飛)，以全馬力速度起飛。 
第四階段(爬升)，最大起飛總重時，用全馬力飛至
150 公尺。 
第五階段(巡航)，以全馬力速度航行 2500 公尺。 
第六階段(下降)，以小馬力下降。 
第七階段(落地、滑行、引擎關機)，熄火滑行約 150
公尺而停止 
 
2.3 起飛總重估算 
根據上述任務規範與任務剖面，依照參考文獻
[24-25]方法進行起飛總重估算。首先引用[24] Table 
2.1 中 Homebuilt 類型載人飛機設計資料建立燃油
分數法計算係數，而其中巡航階段，依任務規範使
用 Breguet 航程公式 [24]計算耗油重量係數為
0.9995。經由輸入 AAA 飛機設計軟體重量估算模
組(Weight)，建立空重與起飛總重關係式： 
 
( )85.2097763.0 −= TOE WW                   (1) 
 
接著，由國內 2006~2008 年 UAV 設計比賽及
世界各國 UAV 之空重與起飛總重資料[26]，輸入
AAA 飛機設計軟體重量估算模組(Weight)，建立如
圖 3所示之國內外無人飛行載具重量資料迴歸分析
關係圖，並獲得起飛總重與空重關係式[24]。  
 
EW = inv  10log [( TOW10log –A)/B]            (2) 
 
由(1)及(2)式可得 A=0.1315，B=1.1140。接著採試
誤(try and error)法則，將預估的起飛總重( TOW )代
入；經過多次嘗試不同的 TOW  值，可以得出 TOW = 
34.60  lb。本研究無人飛行載具之各項重量如下： 
空重      EW  = 13.04 lb (5.93 kg) 
起飛總重  TOW  = 34.60 lb (15.73 kg) 
酬載      PLW  =20.90 lb (9.5 kg) 
 
2.4 性能匹配 
本研究根據主翼所採用之 NACA 66 翼剖面在
雷諾數( NR )等級 105風洞實驗所獲得之最大升力係
數 1.15[27]，再依參考文獻[23]之方法進行轉換計
算穫得起飛狀態全機最大升力係數及降落狀態全
機最大升力係數均為 1.05，並將此兩值設定為設計
條件。接著再以依起飛距離、巡航速率及降落距離
等條件，輸入 AAA 飛機設計軟體性能匹配模組
(Performance)，建立如圖 4 所示之性能匹配圖；由
圖中可知採用 2009年無人飛行載具主翼面積 12.54 
ft2及引擎馬力 2.8 hp 設計參數，對於本研究前置翼
無人飛行載具起飛總重為 34.60 lb (15.73 kg)之條
件，仍可符合其起飛距離(take-off distance)、最大巡
航速率(maximum cruise speed)及降落距離(landing 
distance)等任務規。根據圖 4 獲得之相關設計參數
如下： 
 
翼面負載              SW /  = 2.759 lbs/ ft2 
起飛馬力負載          PW /  = 12.35 lbs/hp

本研究採用固定式前三點起落架設計，依照所

需小於 55 度之要求。 
 
2.11 試飛驗證 
本研究完成前置翼無人飛行載具之研製，並對
其酬載能力實施試飛驗證作業；於 99 年 4 月 14 日
在台北縣新莊市大漢溪畔西盛遙控飛行場完成空
重、載重 2.57 公斤、5.14 公斤等試飛作業，如圖 14
所示；99 年 4 月 26 日完成載重 7.05 公斤，在執行
8.24 公斤試飛作業。由表 5 可知本研究前置翼無人
飛行載具最高酬載測試重量為 8.24 公斤，已達成設
計目標之 87％；而酬載重量佔起飛總重之百分比值
為同重量等級載具平均值(27％)之 2.08 倍，亦已達
成本研究高酬載能力之目標。 
 
3. 微帶天線設計 
3.1 微帶天線發展 
微帶天線早期於 1953年由Deschamps 所提出的
一份文獻 [30]，以及 1955 年由 Gutton 和 Baissiont
提出之專利 [31]。然而始至 1970 年代，微帶天線才
逐漸被各界所注目。所謂的微帶天線結構上包含金
屬片(patch)、介質基板(dielectric substrate)、接地面
(ground)及饋入電路(feed circuitry)等。在 1974 年，
Munson 發表了微帶天線可由饋入網路、發射天線及
相位排列所構成 [32]。在 1975 年，Howell 提出線性
極化和圓形極化天線的設計程序 [33]。而在 1976
年，Derneryd 則利用一對被傳輸線分開的狹縫，發
展出方形和矩形天線的網路等效性網路模組和微帶
天線的線性陣列的設計程序[34]。1978 年 Derneryd
也提出了一種計算輸入阻抗(Input Impedence)的計算
方法[35]，而 1979 年則有 Lo 發表分析矩形微帶天線
的空腔模型(cavity model)和計算共振頻率(resonant 
frequency)的理論 [36]，同年 Derneryd 更進一步的提
出共振空腔模型(resonant cavity model)去計算損耗、
輸入電導(input conductance)和矩形微帶天線的頻寬
(bandwidth) [37]。上述這些早期的工作都是以傳輸線
(transmission line) 或 是 計 算 電 容 (capacitance 
calculations)為基礎，而且結果僅能限制在簡單的尺
寸設計。在 1981 年，Hewan 和 Tulyyathan 提出動差
法(MoM, method of moment)計算微帶天線的電流、
阻抗及共振頻率 [38]。1982 年 Pozar 則應用相同的
方法，計算微帶天線的輸入阻抗和相互偶極(mutual 
coupling) [39]。同年 Bailey 則進一步提出微帶天線的
積分等式理論(integral equation formulation)用以決定
矩形微帶天線的共振頻率和頻寬 [40]。1992年 Pozar
提出一種新的天線結構用以改善微帶天線的性能 
[41]， Ke 和 Wong 則在 1994 年提出一種在圓柱體
上以兩個探針供電(probe feed)的矩形微帶天線的全
波形分析(full-wave analysis) [42]。以上所述相關研
究，是本研究分析微帶天線外形的基本理論依據。 
 
3.2 耦合饋入式線性極化天線 
本研究先使用兩片厚度為 0.4 mm，相對介電常
數 rε 為 4.4，正切損耗常數 δtan 為 0.019 的微波介
質基板堆疊成為整體厚度 1h 為 5.8mm 之天線結構；
其中間高度固定 2h 為 5 mm 的空氣介質層，並在兩
片介質基板外側各印製一層厚度為 0.02 mm 的銅箔
作為金屬輻射面與接地面，同時亦在金屬輻射面蝕
刻出邊長為 L 及寬為 W 之矩形金屬微片。為使天線
模組為達成阻抗匹配，其饋入方式將不採用習知常
用的饋入探針方式，而採用耦合式饋入結構。這個
饋入結構係設計一微帶線長為 fl 、寬為 fw 於輻射
金屬微片的邊緣，同時與金屬微片具有一個寬度為 g
的縫隙，並且伸入金屬微片中達到 t 的距離；接地面
大小係以金屬矩形微片邊長為基準點，左右同時加
寬為 s、向下伸長為 1d 並向上伸長為 2d 。接下來為
達成圓形極化性能，先將金屬微片修正為正方形並
在邊緣設計長度 c 的截角，可在單一供電下產生圓
形極化效果 [43]。圖 15 即為上述耦合饋入式線性極
化微帶天線基本架構( 0=c )，其天線尺寸由式(8)至
(10)可得：

其中， cV 為光速，L 為微帶天線的長度，W 為微帶
天線的寬度， effε 為等效介電常數， 1h 和 2h 分別為
基板與空氣層總厚度及基板單一厚度。 
 
3.3 耦合饋入式微帶天線設計製作與優化調整 
由式(8)至(10)再加上介電常數、操作頻帶、空氣
介質層高度及基板厚度等已知條件，即可得到矩形
金屬微片長度 L 為 47mm，而寬度 W 為 31mm。並
且本研究設定基板長度 21 ddL ++ ( 21 dd = )為
75mm、寬度 sW 2+ 為 57mm。首先固定耦合式饋入
結構尺寸 fl 長度為 10mm 及 fw 為 5mm，同時為降
低實驗複雜度，預先設定耦合式饋入結構中縫隙寬
度為 g，僅調整伸入金屬微片中 t 的距離；為了使本
研究天線得以搭配無人飛行載具並降低干擾空氣動
力流場，本研究亦逐步進行縮小天線尺寸。將上述
天線矩形金屬微片的尺寸 W = 31mm 設定為

2翼剖面最大升力係數之間的關係，仍可適用於小型無人飛行載具，但建議採用雷諾數階數為 5 之
翼剖面氣動力係數，尤其以測試值為佳。(3) 起飛距離性能需求，因小型無人飛行載具起降均在河
岸進行，理應自美國聯邦航空法規 FAR 23 的限制中釋放出來，故遵循 FAR 23 之方法所得的馬力
負載對翼面負載關係，必須加以修正。無人飛行載具以起飛總重分類，其等級範圍差異相當大，
而對於起飛總重超過 2,000 磅等級無人飛行載具採用載人飛機相同概念與方法設計，可較為人所接
受。但是，對於起飛總重 10 至 99 磅等級無人飛行載具之設計，迄今仍無一明確設計概念與方法；
本校以載人飛機設計概念發展小型無人飛行載具設計方法，歷經數次研發驗證已具相當可行性，
然而運用於高酬載性能之小型無人載具設計，尚未實際驗證其可行性及適用性。因此，本次發表
論文係運用此一設計概念及方法，執行高酬載性能之小型無人飛行載具設計及研製，進一步將可
設計出一型具備高酬載及高操控性能之小型無人飛行載具，可供未來小型無人載具構型設計之參
考。由於前述預計發表之論文係由大會安排在第三天 (04 月 22 日)上午 11:30 之 71-1@A-71 議程
才進行發表，所以在完成研討會報到程序後，本人即陸續針對與無人飛行載具設計研究相關領域
之論文發表進行聆聽，希望對個人在此一領域研究之精進能有所助益。
本次研討會無人飛行載具設計研究相關領域共有 Unmanned Aircraft Design I & II 及 Unmanned
Aircraft System Platforms I & II 等四個議程，其中由美國喬治亞理工學院 (Georgia Institute of
Technology) 的 Jayant Ratti 等人所發表之 “Bio-Inspired Micro Air Vehicle: Design and Control
Issues”係探討觀察昆蟲及鳥類的拍撲現象，進而發展出對於微飛行器(MAV, Micro Aerial Vehicle)的
設計及飛行控制機制之精進，該篇論文之研究內容與本人目前與淡江大學共同進行之研究相關，
也可以作為日後研究之參考；在講員的精闢解說之後，也藉由與會學者熱烈討論中得知進一步研

機飛行測試與飛控模擬之驗證情形，該校所研製之 Free-wing Tilt-body 型無人飛行載具可以藉由改
變機頭角度提供升力輔助，而無需大幅改變機翼攻角，亦不啻為一有趣且值得注意之研究方向。
再者，另一篇由美國堪薩斯大學 (The University of Kansas) 的 David A. Royer 等人所發表之論文
“Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis of the Meridian Unmanned Aircraft”，則是在探討該校研製之
Meridian 號無人飛行載具之飛控模式及靈敏度分析；美國堪薩斯大學係飛行載具設計領域之巨擘
Dr. Jan Roskam 任教之學校，該篇論文與本校同樣使用 Jan Roskam 所發展之飛行載具設計軟體進
行相關飛行參數之探討，可謂系出同門。只是該篇論文係導向討論飛行控制參數，與本人發表論
文主要在探討飛行載具全機設計參數有所不同，不過仍有很大的參考價值。
大會最後一天 04 月 22 日上午安排本人論文在 71-1@A-71 議程進行發表，在發表論文之前亦
前往相關領域論文發表場地聆聽各場次論文發表情形。其中來自日本東京大學 (University of Tokyo)
的 Takuma Hino 等人共同發表 “Formation Control of Smal Unmanned Air Vehicles Under Faulty 
Communications”及 “Research Activity on Unmanned Air Vehicles at the University of Tokyo”兩篇
論文，其內容主要在闡述該校歷年來所研發之各型無人飛行載具，並詳述其設計理念及參數驗證，
在一張張投影片放映之下看到了該校對於無人飛行載具研發之用心及投入；看看別人想想自己，
或許我國相關經費不及歐美等先進國家，然而那一份熱情及參與感，卻是我們可以好好學習的。
由美國喬治亞理工學院 (Georgia Institute of Technology) 的 Wesley M. DeBusk 所發表之論文
“Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems for Disaster Relief: Tornado Aley”則是分享該校對於無人飛行載

educated to become skilled at the formal methodology even when they are dealing with model airplanes, or we 
might call those things mini UAVs. We must get through those troubles to develop a new way for our students to 
design their competition UAVs and this is why this paper comes out. 
III. Taiwan Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Design Competition 
The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of Republic of China in TAIWAN hosts an Airplane Design 
Competition for its student members every year since 1999, then to expect all the draft aircraft aloft, this contest 
focused on remotely piloted vehicles and later changed its name as “The Domestic College Student’s Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle Design Competition.” In 2008, another name “2008 Taiwan Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Design 
Competition” was announced to attract high school students, even foreign teams, to join. Now,* it is called “2010 
Taiwan Robot Aircraft Design Competition.”  
There are several Championships to award in this Competition: Beginners’, Advanced Level’s, Flapping-Wings’, 
and Beyond Visual Ranges’ (BVR). Although the organizer now welcomes all participants to enroll all contests, the 
first three authors considered the previous arrangement as it should be, that is, Beginners Division for juniors, 
Flapping-Wings and BVR supposed for graduate students. Therefore, due to their ability and the opportunity to 
practice what they learn in the course “Airplane Design,” our senior undergraduate students are encouraged to 
participate in the Advanced Level Design Contest. Stories are all about this level. 
IV. Contest Rules and Mission Specifications 
In the Advanced Level Design Contest, each competing aircraft must be aloft using an assigned piston engine 
with maximum power of 2.8 hp at 15000 rpm for a required minimum period. It is then scored by its flight 
evaluations (according to the maximum payload it carried, the fuel it consumed, and its configuration), the design 
report (paper and oral work), and the fabrication and demonstration skill. In addition, the team that demonstrates its 
UAV with the most outstanding aerodynamic shape can be awarded the Aerodynamics Trophy with no need to do 
any flight exhibition. The contest rules were modified occasionally and are properly settled recently. Table 1 shows 
how the design competition rules for this title were modified year by year since 2007. 
To give students an appropriate concept that they simply cannot design a cargo airplane with the F-16 
configuration, we strongly recommend them focus merely on payload requirements. While development of the 
adoption of airplane sizing method for mini UAV is still carrying on, we welcome the conventional configurations 
as their designs. Since working on the mission profile is a good place to start the design, as shown in many 
textbooks, all of our competing students have to use the contest rules for setting-up their mission specifications 
followed by mission profiles. The designer† of Year 2007 answered it by using a mission profile exactly the same as 
given in Figure 2.1 of Ref. 2 (exclusive of the Loiter Phase) with the following specification:  
1) Payload: 6 kg  (13.2 lb).  
2) Range: 2 km (1.079 nm). While mission finished, 25% of required fuel reserved. 
3) Altitude:  Cruise at 100 m (328 ft). Maximum at 300 m (984 ft). 
4) Cruise Speed: 70 km/h (19.4 m/s, 63.8 fps) with full payload. 
Most followers did their designs by keeping this specification but with slight modifications, say, the payloads 
increase every year and a longer range of 2500 m (8202 ft) has been used from Year 2008 to present.

[1] This is for the maximum-payload race only. The ground run limit is set to be 100 m (328.1 ft) for the lowest-fuel-
consumption race. 
[2] In the maximum-payload race, those vehicles that take-off out of 60 m bound will be dismissed and scored nothing. 
[3] Compared with the self-recorded amount of payload attempted at home, the contest allows each competitor put only 2 
kilograms (4.4 lb) extra in the air.

Figure 2. Keys for adoption of airplane sizing method to mini UAVs. These blocks show the idea how airplane
take-off weight approximation is modified for mini UAV sizing. 
Competition, shown in the flow chart of Fig. 1 (modified from Figure 1.2 of Ref. 2), we propose a design process 
adapted from that of airplanes. It is similar to that of sizing an airplane in which the take-off weight is first estimated 
by comparing two empty weights from a guessed value of it, one obtained by the fuel-fraction method2 while the 
other by the trend line representing regression bases on historical mini UAVs’ weight data. Iteration is needed if the 
difference between two quantities is not within a given tolerance. 
After the weight estimation, a performance-matching plot is constructed to fit the take-off distance, the landing 
distance constraints with an assigned horsepower. Before further researches on them, Federal Aviation Regulations 
Part 23 (FAR 23) is applied so far to size mini UAVs. From the matching graph, the take-off power loading, take-off 
wing loading, maximum lift coefficients, and aspect ratio, can be selected. With these known data on hand, we can 
do the preliminary configuration layout. As usual, a designer must have some historical data of the same type of 
aerial vehicles to fulfill it. Grouping and adding many existing mini UAVs to those 12 types to form a new type, 
Type 13, in Ref. 2 for this usage might be necessary. Rather than putting others together, it would be better grouping 
our own vehicles for this purpose as discussed later.  
With the preliminary configuration, by Class I Stability Analysis as described in Ref. 4, longitudinal X-plot and 
directional x-plot are used to see if the empennage match the inherent stability goal or not. If it does not, then go 
back to the Preliminary Configuration Layout process and do the re-configuration.  
In this work at the beginning, there was almost nothing available for sizing-reference; therefore, the designer of 
Year 2007’s had no choice using some analogous data from Type 2 airplanes of Ref. 2 and the contestant UAV in 
Year 2006. (That one was made by students under instruction of the third author according to his model-airplane 
experience.) Successors were lucky simply because they have at least two UAVs that can be referred to. In addition, 
due to the tight schedule, few undergraduate designers can enter the iteration and re-configuration process.  
It is clear that what have been shown in this design process is nothing but more like that for sizing an airplane. 
The difference between these two kinds of aerial vehicles will be emphasized while the details of adaptation reveal.

Figure 3. Keys for adoption of airplane sizing method to mini UAVs (Cont’d). These blocks show the idea
how to adapt both the matching for performance requirements and selection of airfoils to fit the calculated
maximum lift coefficients.  
D. Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics 
Selection of airfoils to provide sufficient lift for an airplane is a very important step to size them. The maximum 
lift coefficient for airplane, CLmax, decided to satisfy the performance requirements should be magnified to the 
maximum lift coefficient for wing, CLmaxW, by Eq. (3).
4 It is because of the trim considerations for conventional 
configuration as well as for with canard, the factors 1.05 to 1.1 will be chosen depending on how far the horizontal 
stabilizer is from the center of gravity.  We can simply assume that this is the case for our mini UAVs since so far it 
seems to us difficult to check it experimentally.  
 CLmaxW = 1.05 to 1.1 CLmax (3) 
The section maximum lift coefficient, clmax, should be obtained using Eq. (4) from the maximum lift coefficient 
for wing,4 
 CLmaxW = kλ (clmaxr + clmaxt  ) / 2 (4) 
where kλ is taper ratio correction factor for wing maximum lift coefficient obtained from historical airplane data, and 
kλ is 0.88 for λ = 1.0 as 0.95 for λ = 0.4. Here, λ is the taper ratio. In Eq. (4), clmaxr and clmaxt  are the section 
maximum lift coefficients of wing root and tip airfoils, respectively. As mentioned in Section V, these two different 
kinds of air vehicles fly at distinctive Reynolds numbers, applicability of Eq. (4) to mini UAVs should be checked. 
Fortunately, it is shown still valid for his mini UAV with two typical low speed airfoils at Reynolds number about

work for mini UAVs, the above-issued X-plots can no doubt be applied to do the jobs since the low Reynolds 
number aerodynamics has been used to character this type of air vehicles.  
VI. History of Development of Our Vehicles 
The following is the summary of how this work approaches the above-mentioned during those days from the 
year 2006 to present. 
First design came out in 2007, named One-Piece, with an assumption that mini UAVs can be sized by the same 
methods used in drafting Type 2 of Roskam’s airplane category.2 We originally specified a requirement with 13.2 
pounds payload at that time. Also according to the rules set by the contest organizer, a mission profile was defined 
by breaking it down into seven phases, including engine-start and warm-up, taxi, take-off, climb, cruise, descent, 
landing and shut-down. The take-off weight was estimated by the fuel-fraction method2 while the fuel fraction of 
each phase except Cruise Phase was assumed to be the same value used in Type 2 airplanes, the single piston engine 
driven airplanes. Mini UAVs used in the regression line for empty weight versus take-off weight were picked from 
Jane’s online All the World’s Aircraft. 9 The actual take-off weight of One-Piece was reduced by a factor of 0.442 
from the calculated value to compensate for the material difference between it and those preceding mini UAVs. 
One-Piece won the first prize aloft with a dead weight of 15.10 pounds (designed for 13.23 pounds payload) and it 
showed the possibility of this idea (as the title is talking about).  
Once the likelihood became clear, those mini UAVs used for establishing the regression line of log10WE versus 
log10WTO were moved, instead, the weight quantities of domestic participant UAVs were placed on the weight trend 
line. The payload was up by amount of 2 pounds and the wing was changed to be low. Many of the design 
parameters in the development remained the same. The second mini UAV was then made with a name, Soaring 
Eagle. 
Nevertheless, it is sad to say that while hunting for a take-off weight on the computing progression, the design 
process did not converge. A value of weight that made Δ the smallest was assigned to be the take-off weight. Note 
that here Δ is the difference between logarithms of the guessed empty weight and the calculated one based on 
previous aircraft of the same kind.2 More unhappily, Soaring Eagle crashed at the first flight trial, was later fixed but 
crashed again at the contest. Since the mission was incomplete, no way to say it meets the requirement.  
Next two UAVs were to challenge a payload requisite of 19.8 pounds. On the other hand, to improve the 
convergence of the design process, all mini UAVs including foreign ones and participants’ were put together to 
obtain a new regression line and this did work, a solution of take-off weight appeared. In the spring of Year 2009, 
these two UAVs, TYLL-H and TYLL-L, rolled out. The TYLL-H was with high wing and TYLL-L the low. To 
satisfy the requirements of increasing payloads, the third author recommended students reduce the empty weight, 
especially the horizontal tail weight. These two vehicles were going to use the smaller horizontal tails than those of 
One-Piece and Soaring Eagle. Even with the satisfactory longitudinal stability of the forerunners’ and no need to 
modify the horizontal tail too much, the longitudinal x-plot was still applied to see if it worked or not with the larger 
wings. Anyway, these two aerial vehicles did not bring to us too much excitement because TYLL-L crashed and 
TYLL-H obtained only 5th place although it carried 21.56 pounds for its shipment (actually, it reaches the goal). 
For those four mini UAVs, airplane aerodynamics (not calibrated for Reynolds number effect) was temporarily 
used, and it showed not much discrepancy between the analysis and flight test results. This is probably by that the 
order of Reynolds numbers drops from six to five, aerodynamic characteristics did decrease but not very much. For 
the sake of pursuing precision, recent work will use low Reynolds number aerodynamics. Also, note that both two 
vehicles with low wing were all destroyed in the flight competition; the causes are worth finding out. So far, it 
would be blamed that we did not make lateral stability analysis (even without any directional x-plot). New design 
will cover this subject anyway. Table 2 lists all previous and recent work of our group in brief. 
In the spring of 2010, an air vehicle designed by this adapting airplane sizing method named as Devil Bat was 
fabricated. It has an unusual shape, three surfaces. While tested on the first time, Devil Bat was a brand new plane 
for the third author to fly. It was not an easy task because he was used to the conventional configurations. It did not 
successfully lift-off but sat on the ground with damage to engine mount probably due to unexpected fast pitch up 
motion. During the following days, Chang* and his classmates were busy doing the repeated work preparing for 
flight tests, including that to fix the damaged air vehicle almost after every trial. Although the final test flight was a 
nearly perfect one, the ground controller felt that it was still not very handy to fly this three-surface stuff. Despite 
plenty of time being needed to get used to it, the time was running out. On the right next day, we went south for the 
competition.

A. One-Piece 
The student designer of Class 2007, Cheng,* contributes to this group with the following: First trial of using 
mission specification and mission profile to estimate take-off weight, First one to apply the performance marching 
plot for mini-UAV, and, the most significant contribution, Setting-up the value of reduction factor for wood in 
subsequent applications of this team. The concept of weight reduction is from Ref. 2, which suggests a value of 0.75 
for Wcomp / Wal, in which, Wcomp and Wal are the weights of major components made of composites and aluminum, 
respectively. In One-Piece, a value of 0.69 was used. Then, with some measured components’ weight, a value of 
0.64 was applied for weight reduction further from composite to balsa wood, that is, Wwood / Wcomp was set to be 
0.64. Here, Wwood is the weight of component made of wood. The net factor, Wwood / Wal, is therefore 0.69 x 0.64, 
which is, 0.442. The calculated empty weight subtracting weights of non-wooden components was multiplied by this 
number, 0.442. In One-Piece, the engine with 1.323 pounds, landing gears with 1.543 pounds, and the fixed

C. TYLL-H  
Each year tough competing teams showed their capacity to carry more and it brought us the urgent need to new 
requirement of increasing the payload. However, the third author asked students not to increase the empty weigh too 
much by keeping the horizontal tail about the same as the previous designs. Even that, the wing area must be  
enlarged to provide sufficient lifting force to bring more dead weights in the air.  
As mentioned above, the longitudinal X-plot would be a good tool to do primary stability analysis for mini 
UAVs. Its original purpose is to find a suitable size for 
the horizontal tail to fit the requirement of S.M. of –10%. 
In this case, although not much choice could be made 
about the size of horizontal tail, Lu was still asked to use 
the longitudinal X-plot to find S.M. with the almost 
given horizontal tail area. He is actually the first person 
to use this tool for a mini UAV design.  
Unfortunately, he was stuck with a strange result as 
shown in Fig. 7. Due to the tight schedule, the 
fabrication process could not stop there waiting him get 
through this problem. Therefore, the third author used his 
model-airplane experience to decide the position of wing 
apex and kept the process going. Finally, after study, the 
second author found that the key parameter is the x-
coordinates of the wing apex. With an inappropriate 
number for this parameter, people cannot find a suitable 
design for mini UAV. See Figs. 7 and 8 for this concept. 
The conclusion we have from this coincidence are: 1) 
Longitudinal X-plot works for mini UAV design even in 
this case the airplane aerodynamics rather than that of 
low Reynolds number was used. If not, we certainly 
would have no chance to find this new parameter. 2) 
Model-airplane experience can yet play the dominant 
and undeniable role in racing Taiwanese mini UAVs. 
That is why other teams without knowing exactly the mini UAV design method like us can still win the first prize. 
 
 
Figure 7. Longitudinal X-plot for TYLL-H with
Wing Apex at 3.35 ft (102 cm). Within the assigned
range of horizontal tail areas, a neutral point does not
exist; the designer cannot have the chance to turn his
(or her) design from instability to stability by
increasing the horizontal tail area. It is a poor design.
 
 
Figure 8. Longitudinal X-plots for TYLL-H. a) If the wing apex is placed at x = 2.62 ft (80 cm), it is still a
poor layout. b) For the wing apex at x = 2.92 ft (89 cm), it turns out be a better design since the neutral point
appears. The actual x-coordinate of the wing apex for TYLL-H after fabrication is 2.97 ft (90.5 cm). The
origin of x-axis is set at 1.64 ft (50 cm) ahead of the fuselage apex.

Another purpose of Monk Vulture is to use the fuselage of TYLL-L and modify its vertical tail to give sufficient 
directional stability according to Eq. (6). The primary directional stability analysis using the original data of TYLL-
L shows that  Cnβ for TYLL-L is 0.0007 per degree (Fig. 10). This implies that we need to make the vertical tail 
bigger. Monk vulture still keeps its engine at the head and a possible three-surface configuration will be applied. 
Unlike Devil Bat, the power effect on the longitudinal stability in Monk Vulture could be negligible but the 
slipstream effect of propeller on the canard should not be forgotten. Before this manuscript is completed, Monk 
Vulture is still being fabricated.  
 
VIII. Configurations of Mini UAVs in NDU, TAIWAN 
Now, it is interesting to reveal all of our air vehicles. As shown in Fig. 11, the four mini UAVs with 
conventional configurations, One-Piece, Soaring Eagle, TYLL-H, and TYLL-L, are placed together to display how 
they look like. Accompanying is Table 6 to demonstrate the comparison of their shapes. The two recent mini UAVs 
using the now developed method, Devil Bat and Monk Vulture, are put on view respectively in Figs. 12 and 13. 
Their individual sizes are also shown in Table 6.  
IX. Mini UAV Sizing Method 
At this moment, it is good to give a systematic summary* for mini UAV sizing against a payload requirement 
before further discussion is made. (We sincerely expect that it can be extended to other requirements as many as 
possible in the future.) With Fig. 1, these steps are:  
Step 1. Build a mission profile from the mission specification issued by the Competition, in this case, the 
payload requirement dominates. For each team, construct its own weight trend line for the previous competing mini 
UAVs. 
Step 2. Use the fuel-fraction method2 to estimate the mission fuel weight after a guess of take-off weight is made 
first. For cruise phase, Breguet’s range equation with a measured fuel consumption rate is adequate. For other 
mission phases (loiter phase not included), do as suggested in Ref. 2. Obtain a tentative empty weight. 
Step 3. With the guessed take-off weight, find the allowable value of empty weight from this line.   
Step 4. Compare the values for tentative empty weight and for allowable empty weight. If they do not match 
within the tolerance pre-selected, guess a new take-off weight and repeat Steps 2 to 4.  
Step 5. Do weight reduction by using 0.442 as described in Sub-section A of Section VII. Other teams might 
need different numbers for their own weight reduction factors. 
Step 6. Break the take-off weight into component weights according to the weight fractions of existing previous 
air vehicles. In our case, the data of One-Piece ran first for modeling and more is available when time keeps going.   
Step 7. Carry out the sizing calculations to take-off and landing distance requirements with the methods in Ref. 2. 
Consider all mini UAVs as FAR 23 airplanes.  
                                                          
*We hope anyone who wants to participate in the contest will find it benefit to follow these guidelines to get better 
scores for his (her) report, at least, good to a Taiwanese contestant.

XI.  Conclusion 
As described in the beginning, this study was motivated by teaching students for their competing aircraft. This 
paper is more like for educational purpose than for research. In order to work very well, development of sizing mini 
UAVs by airplane design methods is still progressing. However, students learn by practice designing their own 
aircraft and finally see them aloft or crashed depending on how well they prepare for the flights, including 
arrangement of schedule, communicating with the test-pilot, on-site repairs, and so on. All are beyond the course 
“Airplane Design” can teach them and good for their career. For teachers, the more we spend on it the more we find 
what to do in the future for mini UAV design.  
From Section X, the following are probably worth doing in the future:  
1) Use a new approach to estimate mission fuel weight with advantage of no need to do weight reduction 
since the weight trend is established from our group’s own vehicles now.  
2) If possible, conduct wind tunnel testing for low Reynolds number airfoils, covering a wider spectrum in 
the range of 105 < RN < 106.  
3) Measure the take-off distances on site to establish a new equation relating them to the take-off parameters 
defined as in Eq. (1) but with revision. Use this equation to construct a new barrier for sizing to take-off 
requirement in the matching graph. (Or, another new approach to find relation of the take-off distance to 
wing loading and power loading at take-off.) 
4) Develop the methodology for sizing to endurance requirements, or actually, it is to cruise speed 
requirements.  
5) After finishing Item 3 above, estimate the maximum payload the assigned engine can drive and wait to see 
what will happen in the coming contests to evaluate this calculation.

當可行性，然而運用於高酬載性能之小型無人載具設計，尚未實際驗證其可行性及適用性。
因此，本次發表論文係運用此一設計概念及方法，執行高酬載性能之小型無人飛行載具設計
及研製，進一步將可設計出一型具備高酬載及高操控性能之小型無人飛行載具，可供未來小
型無人載具構型設計之參考。由於前述預計發表之論文係由大會安排在第三天 (04 月 22 日)
上午 11:30 之 71-1@A-71 議程才進行發表，所以在完成研討會報到程序後，本人即陸續針對
與無人飛行載具設計研究相關領域之論文發表進行聆聽，希望對個人在此一領域研究之精進
能有所助益。
本次研討會無人飛行載具設計研究相關領域共有 Unmanned Aircraft Design I & II 及
Unmanned Aircraft System Platforms I & II 等四個議程，其中由美國喬治亞理工學院 (Georgia

educated to become skilled at the formal methodology even when they are dealing with model airplanes, or we 
might call those things mini UAVs. We must get through those troubles to develop a new way for our students to 
design their competition UAVs and this is why this paper comes out. 
III. Taiwan Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Design Competition 
The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of Republic of China in TAIWAN hosts an Airplane Design 
Competition for its student members every year since 1999, then to expect all the draft aircraft aloft, this contest 
focused on remotely piloted vehicles and later changed its name as “The Domestic College Student’s Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle Design Competition.” In 2008, another name “2008 Taiwan Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Design 
Competition” was announced to attract high school students, even foreign teams, to join. Now,* it is called “2010 
Taiwan Robot Aircraft Design Competition.”  
There are several Championships to award in this Competition: Beginners’, Advanced Level’s, Flapping-Wings’, 
and Beyond Visual Ranges’ (BVR). Although the organizer now welcomes all participants to enroll all contests, the 
first three authors considered the previous arrangement as it should be, that is, Beginners Division for juniors, 
Flapping-Wings and BVR supposed for graduate students. Therefore, due to their ability and the opportunity to 
practice what they learn in the course “Airplane Design,” our senior undergraduate students are encouraged to 
participate in the Advanced Level Design Contest. Stories are all about this level. 
IV. Contest Rules and Mission Specifications 
In the Advanced Level Design Contest, each competing aircraft must be aloft using an assigned piston engine 
with maximum power of 2.8 hp at 15000 rpm for a required minimum period. It is then scored by its flight 
evaluations (according to the maximum payload it carried, the fuel it consumed, and its configuration), the design 
report (paper and oral work), and the fabrication and demonstration skill. In addition, the team that demonstrates its 
UAV with the most outstanding aerodynamic shape can be awarded the Aerodynamics Trophy with no need to do 
any flight exhibition. The contest rules were modified occasionally and are properly settled recently. Table 1 shows 
how the design competition rules for this title were modified year by year since 2007. 
To give students an appropriate concept that they simply cannot design a cargo airplane with the F-16 
configuration, we strongly recommend them focus merely on payload requirements. While development of the 
adoption of airplane sizing method for mini UAV is still carrying on, we welcome the conventional configurations 
as their designs. Since working on the mission profile is a good place to start the design, as shown in many 
textbooks, all of our competing students have to use the contest rules for setting-up their mission specifications 
followed by mission profiles. The designer† of Year 2007 answered it by using a mission profile exactly the same as 
given in Figure 2.1 of Ref. 2 (exclusive of the Loiter Phase) with the following specification:  
1) Payload: 6 kg  (13.2 lb).  
2) Range: 2 km (1.079 nm). While mission finished, 25% of required fuel reserved. 
3) Altitude:  Cruise at 100 m (328 ft). Maximum at 300 m (984 ft). 
4) Cruise Speed: 70 km/h (19.4 m/s, 63.8 fps) with full payload. 
Most followers did their designs by keeping this specification but with slight modifications, say, the payloads 
increase every year and a longer range of 2500 m (8202 ft) has been used from Year 2008 to present.

consumption race. 
[2] In the maximum-payload race, those vehicles that take-off out of 60 m bound will be dismissed and scored nothing. 
[3] Compared with the self-recorded amount of payload attempted at home, the contest allows each competitor put only 2 
kilograms (4.4 lb) extra in the air.

Figure 2. Keys for adoption of airplane sizing method to mini UAVs. These blocks show the idea how airplane
take-off weight approximation is modified for mini UAV sizing. 
Competition, shown in the flow chart of Fig. 1 (modified from Figure 1.2 of Ref. 2), we propose a design process 
adapted from that of airplanes. It is similar to that of sizing an airplane in which the take-off weight is first estimated 
by comparing two empty weights from a guessed value of it, one obtained by the fuel-fraction method2 while the 
other by the trend line representing regression bases on historical mini UAVs’ weight data. Iteration is needed if the 
difference between two quantities is not within a given tolerance. 
After the weight estimation, a performance-matching plot is constructed to fit the take-off distance, the landing 
distance constraints with an assigned horsepower. Before further researches on them, Federal Aviation Regulations 
Part 23 (FAR 23) is applied so far to size mini UAVs. From the matching graph, the take-off power loading, take-off 
wing loading, maximum lift coefficients, and aspect ratio, can be selected. With these known data on hand, we can 
do the preliminary configuration layout. As usual, a designer must have some historical data of the same type of 
aerial vehicles to fulfill it. Grouping and adding many existing mini UAVs to those 12 types to form a new type, 
Type 13, in Ref. 2 for this usage might be necessary. Rather than putting others together, it would be better grouping 
our own vehicles for this purpose as discussed later.  
With the preliminary configuration, by Class I Stability Analysis as described in Ref. 4, longitudinal X-plot and 
directional x-plot are used to see if the empennage match the inherent stability goal or not. If it does not, then go 
back to the Preliminary Configuration Layout process and do the re-configuration.  
In this work at the beginning, there was almost nothing available for sizing-reference; therefore, the designer of 
Year 2007’s had no choice using some analogous data from Type 2 airplanes of Ref. 2 and the contestant UAV in 
Year 2006. (That one was made by students under instruction of the third author according to his model-airplane 
experience.) Successors were lucky simply because they have at least two UAVs that can be referred to. In addition, 
due to the tight schedule, few undergraduate designers can enter the iteration and re-configuration process.  
It is clear that what have been shown in this design process is nothing but more like that for sizing an airplane. 
The difference between these two kinds of aerial vehicles will be emphasized while the details of adaptation reveal.

Figure 3. Keys for adoption of airplane sizing method to mini UAVs (Cont’d). These blocks show the idea
how to adapt both the matching for performance requirements and selection of airfoils to fit the calculated
maximum lift coefficients.  
D. Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics 
Selection of airfoils to provide sufficient lift for an airplane is a very important step to size them. The maximum 
lift coefficient for airplane, CLmax, decided to satisfy the performance requirements should be magnified to the 
maximum lift coefficient for wing, CLmaxW, by Eq. (3).
4 It is because of the trim considerations for conventional 
configuration as well as for with canard, the factors 1.05 to 1.1 will be chosen depending on how far the horizontal 
stabilizer is from the center of gravity.  We can simply assume that this is the case for our mini UAVs since so far it 
seems to us difficult to check it experimentally.  
 CLmaxW = 1.05 to 1.1 CLmax (3) 
The section maximum lift coefficient, clmax, should be obtained using Eq. (4) from the maximum lift coefficient 
for wing,4 
 CLmaxW = kλ (clmaxr + clmaxt  ) / 2 (4) 
where kλ is taper ratio correction factor for wing maximum lift coefficient obtained from historical airplane data, and 
kλ is 0.88 for λ = 1.0 as 0.95 for λ = 0.4. Here, λ is the taper ratio. In Eq. (4), clmaxr and clmaxt  are the section 
maximum lift coefficients of wing root and tip airfoils, respectively. As mentioned in Section V, these two different 
kinds of air vehicles fly at distinctive Reynolds numbers, applicability of Eq. (4) to mini UAVs should be checked. 
Fortunately, it is shown still valid for his mini UAV with two typical low speed airfoils at Reynolds number about

work for mini UAVs, the above-issued X-plots can no doubt be applied to do the jobs since the low Reynolds 
number aerodynamics has been used to character this type of air vehicles.  
VI. History of Development of Our Vehicles 
The following is the summary of how this work approaches the above-mentioned during those days from the 
year 2006 to present. 
First design came out in 2007, named One-Piece, with an assumption that mini UAVs can be sized by the same 
methods used in drafting Type 2 of Roskam’s airplane category.2 We originally specified a requirement with 13.2 
pounds payload at that time. Also according to the rules set by the contest organizer, a mission profile was defined 
by breaking it down into seven phases, including engine-start and warm-up, taxi, take-off, climb, cruise, descent, 
landing and shut-down. The take-off weight was estimated by the fuel-fraction method2 while the fuel fraction of 
each phase except Cruise Phase was assumed to be the same value used in Type 2 airplanes, the single piston engine 
driven airplanes. Mini UAVs used in the regression line for empty weight versus take-off weight were picked from 
Jane’s online All the World’s Aircraft. 9 The actual take-off weight of One-Piece was reduced by a factor of 0.442 
from the calculated value to compensate for the material difference between it and those preceding mini UAVs. 
One-Piece won the first prize aloft with a dead weight of 15.10 pounds (designed for 13.23 pounds payload) and it 
showed the possibility of this idea (as the title is talking about).  
Once the likelihood became clear, those mini UAVs used for establishing the regression line of log10WE versus 
log10WTO were moved, instead, the weight quantities of domestic participant UAVs were placed on the weight trend 
line. The payload was up by amount of 2 pounds and the wing was changed to be low. Many of the design 
parameters in the development remained the same. The second mini UAV was then made with a name, Soaring 
Eagle. 
Nevertheless, it is sad to say that while hunting for a take-off weight on the computing progression, the design 
process did not converge. A value of weight that made Δ the smallest was assigned to be the take-off weight. Note 
that here Δ is the difference between logarithms of the guessed empty weight and the calculated one based on 
previous aircraft of the same kind.2 More unhappily, Soaring Eagle crashed at the first flight trial, was later fixed but 
crashed again at the contest. Since the mission was incomplete, no way to say it meets the requirement.  
Next two UAVs were to challenge a payload requisite of 19.8 pounds. On the other hand, to improve the 
convergence of the design process, all mini UAVs including foreign ones and participants’ were put together to 
obtain a new regression line and this did work, a solution of take-off weight appeared. In the spring of Year 2009, 
these two UAVs, TYLL-H and TYLL-L, rolled out. The TYLL-H was with high wing and TYLL-L the low. To 
satisfy the requirements of increasing payloads, the third author recommended students reduce the empty weight, 
especially the horizontal tail weight. These two vehicles were going to use the smaller horizontal tails than those of 
One-Piece and Soaring Eagle. Even with the satisfactory longitudinal stability of the forerunners’ and no need to 
modify the horizontal tail too much, the longitudinal x-plot was still applied to see if it worked or not with the larger 
wings. Anyway, these two aerial vehicles did not bring to us too much excitement because TYLL-L crashed and 
TYLL-H obtained only 5th place although it carried 21.56 pounds for its shipment (actually, it reaches the goal). 
For those four mini UAVs, airplane aerodynamics (not calibrated for Reynolds number effect) was temporarily 
used, and it showed not much discrepancy between the analysis and flight test results. This is probably by that the 
order of Reynolds numbers drops from six to five, aerodynamic characteristics did decrease but not very much. For 
the sake of pursuing precision, recent work will use low Reynolds number aerodynamics. Also, note that both two 
vehicles with low wing were all destroyed in the flight competition; the causes are worth finding out. So far, it 
would be blamed that we did not make lateral stability analysis (even without any directional x-plot). New design 
will cover this subject anyway. Table 2 lists all previous and recent work of our group in brief. 
In the spring of 2010, an air vehicle designed by this adapting airplane sizing method named as Devil Bat was 
fabricated. It has an unusual shape, three surfaces. While tested on the first time, Devil Bat was a brand new plane 
for the third author to fly. It was not an easy task because he was used to the conventional configurations. It did not 
successfully lift-off but sat on the ground with damage to engine mount probably due to unexpected fast pitch up 
motion. During the following days, Chang* and his classmates were busy doing the repeated work preparing for 
flight tests, including that to fix the damaged air vehicle almost after every trial. Although the final test flight was a 
nearly perfect one, the ground controller felt that it was still not very handy to fly this three-surface stuff. Despite 
plenty of time being needed to get used to it, the time was running out. On the right next day, we went south for the 
competition.

The student designer of Class 2007, Cheng,* contributes to this group with the following: First trial of using 
mission specification and mission profile to estimate take-off weight, First one to apply the performance marching 
plot for mini-UAV, and, the most significant contribution, Setting-up the value of reduction factor for wood in 
subsequent applications of this team. The concept of weight reduction is from Ref. 2, which suggests a value of 0.75 
for Wcomp / Wal, in which, Wcomp and Wal are the weights of major components made of composites and aluminum, 
respectively. In One-Piece, a value of 0.69 was used. Then, with some measured components’ weight, a value of 
0.64 was applied for weight reduction further from composite to balsa wood, that is, Wwood / Wcomp was set to be 
0.64. Here, Wwood is the weight of component made of wood. The net factor, Wwood / Wal, is therefore 0.69 x 0.64, 
which is, 0.442. The calculated empty weight subtracting weights of non-wooden components was multiplied by this 
number, 0.442. In One-Piece, the engine with 1.323 pounds, landing gears with 1.543 pounds, and the fixed

C. TYLL-H  
Each year tough competing teams showed their capacity to carry more and it brought us the urgent need to new 
requirement of increasing the payload. However, the third author asked students not to increase the empty weigh too 
much by keeping the horizontal tail about the same as the previous designs. Even that, the wing area must be  
enlarged to provide sufficient lifting force to bring more dead weights in the air.  
As mentioned above, the longitudinal X-plot would be a good tool to do primary stability analysis for mini 
UAVs. Its original purpose is to find a suitable size for 
the horizontal tail to fit the requirement of S.M. of –10%. 
In this case, although not much choice could be made 
about the size of horizontal tail, Lu was still asked to use 
the longitudinal X-plot to find S.M. with the almost 
given horizontal tail area. He is actually the first person 
to use this tool for a mini UAV design.  
Unfortunately, he was stuck with a strange result as 
shown in Fig. 7. Due to the tight schedule, the 
fabrication process could not stop there waiting him get 
through this problem. Therefore, the third author used his 
model-airplane experience to decide the position of wing 
apex and kept the process going. Finally, after study, the 
second author found that the key parameter is the x-
coordinates of the wing apex. With an inappropriate 
number for this parameter, people cannot find a suitable 
design for mini UAV. See Figs. 7 and 8 for this concept. 
The conclusion we have from this coincidence are: 1) 
Longitudinal X-plot works for mini UAV design even in 
this case the airplane aerodynamics rather than that of 
low Reynolds number was used. If not, we certainly 
would have no chance to find this new parameter. 2) 
Model-airplane experience can yet play the dominant 
and undeniable role in racing Taiwanese mini UAVs. 
That is why other teams without knowing exactly the mini UAV design method like us can still win the first prize. 
 
 
Figure 7. Longitudinal X-plot for TYLL-H with
Wing Apex at 3.35 ft (102 cm). Within the assigned
range of horizontal tail areas, a neutral point does not
exist; the designer cannot have the chance to turn his
(or her) design from instability to stability by
increasing the horizontal tail area. It is a poor design.
 
 
Figure 8. Longitudinal X-plots for TYLL-H. a) If the wing apex is placed at x = 2.62 ft (80 cm), it is still a
poor layout. b) For the wing apex at x = 2.92 ft (89 cm), it turns out be a better design since the neutral point
appears. The actual x-coordinate of the wing apex for TYLL-H after fabrication is 2.97 ft (90.5 cm). The
origin of x-axis is set at 1.64 ft (50 cm) ahead of the fuselage apex.

Another purpose of Monk Vulture is to use the fuselage of TYLL-L and modify its vertical tail to give sufficient 
directional stability according to Eq. (6). The primary directional stability analysis using the original data of TYLL-
L shows that  Cnβ for TYLL-L is 0.0007 per degree (Fig. 10). This implies that we need to make the vertical tail 
bigger. Monk vulture still keeps its engine at the head and a possible three-surface configuration will be applied. 
Unlike Devil Bat, the power effect on the longitudinal stability in Monk Vulture could be negligible but the 
slipstream effect of propeller on the canard should not be forgotten. Before this manuscript is completed, Monk 
Vulture is still being fabricated.  
 
VIII. Configurations of Mini UAVs in NDU, TAIWAN 
Now, it is interesting to reveal all of our air vehicles. As shown in Fig. 11, the four mini UAVs with 
conventional configurations, One-Piece, Soaring Eagle, TYLL-H, and TYLL-L, are placed together to display how 
they look like. Accompanying is Table 6 to demonstrate the comparison of their shapes. The two recent mini UAVs 
using the now developed method, Devil Bat and Monk Vulture, are put on view respectively in Figs. 12 and 13. 
Their individual sizes are also shown in Table 6.  
IX. Mini UAV Sizing Method 
At this moment, it is good to give a systematic summary* for mini UAV sizing against a payload requirement 
before further discussion is made. (We sincerely expect that it can be extended to other requirements as many as 
possible in the future.) With Fig. 1, these steps are:  
Step 1. Build a mission profile from the mission specification issued by the Competition, in this case, the 
payload requirement dominates. For each team, construct its own weight trend line for the previous competing mini 
UAVs. 
Step 2. Use the fuel-fraction method2 to estimate the mission fuel weight after a guess of take-off weight is made 
first. For cruise phase, Breguet’s range equation with a measured fuel consumption rate is adequate. For other 
mission phases (loiter phase not included), do as suggested in Ref. 2. Obtain a tentative empty weight. 
Step 3. With the guessed take-off weight, find the allowable value of empty weight from this line.   
Step 4. Compare the values for tentative empty weight and for allowable empty weight. If they do not match 
within the tolerance pre-selected, guess a new take-off weight and repeat Steps 2 to 4.  
Step 5. Do weight reduction by using 0.442 as described in Sub-section A of Section VII. Other teams might 
need different numbers for their own weight reduction factors. 
Step 6. Break the take-off weight into component weights according to the weight fractions of existing previous 
air vehicles. In our case, the data of One-Piece ran first for modeling and more is available when time keeps going.   
Step 7. Carry out the sizing calculations to take-off and landing distance requirements with the methods in Ref. 2. 
Consider all mini UAVs as FAR 23 airplanes.  
                                                          
*We hope anyone who wants to participate in the contest will find it benefit to follow these guidelines to get better 
scores for his (her) report, at least, good to a Taiwanese contestant.

XI.  Conclusion 
As described in the beginning, this study was motivated by teaching students for their competing aircraft. This 
paper is more like for educational purpose than for research. In order to work very well, development of sizing mini 
UAVs by airplane design methods is still progressing. However, students learn by practice designing their own 
aircraft and finally see them aloft or crashed depending on how well they prepare for the flights, including 
arrangement of schedule, communicating with the test-pilot, on-site repairs, and so on. All are beyond the course 
“Airplane Design” can teach them and good for their career. For teachers, the more we spend on it the more we find 
what to do in the future for mini UAV design.  
From Section X, the following are probably worth doing in the future:  
1) Use a new approach to estimate mission fuel weight with advantage of no need to do weight reduction 
since the weight trend is established from our group’s own vehicles now.  
2) If possible, conduct wind tunnel testing for low Reynolds number airfoils, covering a wider spectrum in 
the range of 105 < RN < 106.  
3) Measure the take-off distances on site to establish a new equation relating them to the take-off parameters 
defined as in Eq. (1) but with revision. Use this equation to construct a new barrier for sizing to take-off 
requirement in the matching graph. (Or, another new approach to find relation of the take-off distance to 
wing loading and power loading at take-off.) 
4) Develop the methodology for sizing to endurance requirements, or actually, it is to cruise speed 
requirements.  
5) After finishing Item 3 above, estimate the maximum payload the assigned engine can drive and wait to see 
what will happen in the coming contests to evaluate this calculation.

With the success of UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicles) in the recent wars as well as their envisioned applications for commercial purposes, and the confluence of computation, information, navigation,
communication, and intelligent system technologies, the unthinkable – having pilotless autonomous planes carrying passengers and cargo in the commercial air-space, has become potentially achievable in
our lifetime. For the purposes of this discussion, autonomous civil aircraft implies the capability to perform all the typical functions required for safe flight while flying in conformance with national airspace
constraints, without having a human in the control loop, either on- or off-board. This panel of experts will discuss the challenges to making civil autonomous aircraft a reality from multiple perspectives:
technical advancements that still need to be made, the policy support needed to make the investments in technology, the regulatory challenges for flying in civil airspace etc.
