educational systems, all provide learners a rich set of learning resources. In order to provide learners with suitable learning 
resources to their needs, an adaptive recommendation component become important in these systems. This research aims to 
design a personalize recommendation system based on the personal recommendation knowledge extracted by a novel method that 
is derived from the experience sharing mechanism of natural ants. In this paper, the aim is to propose more efficient algorithms 
that can deal with a knowledge space containing a large number of resource items. The key approaches to resolving this practical 
issue include revising the global update policy, an adaptive search policy and a segmented-goal training strategy, and adoption of 
negative feedbacks. Based on simulation results, it is shown that this mechanism result in more efficient ones that can be applied 
in practical situations. In the future, a set of experiments will be conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the method in real 
applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 
As the explosion of information due to the Internet in modern age, it becomes more important and more difficult to retrieve 
information adapted to user preferences. Therefore, personalized recommendation systems are in need to provide proper 
recommendations based on users‟ requirements and preferences [10]. Recommendation systems also find their applications in the 
eLearning area, especially as personalized web-based learning has become an important learning paradigm in the 21st century. 
Since learning resources grow so abundant on the Internet that the problem of how to help learners get appropriate learning 
materials to fit their learning needs has become a popular research subject in the area of adaptive content delivery. 
A challenging work of this research lies in how to discover recommendation knowledge efficiently from a huge access database 
of a web-based learning platform [1][2]. An earlier research of ours [6] showed that a fuzzy knowledge extraction model can be 
established to extract personalized recommendation knowledge by discovering effective learning paths from the access database 
through a novel approach that is inspired by the experience sharing mechanism of natural ants. This approach imitates the 
experience sharing mechanism of natural ants, which share the paths they have found leading to food by scattering pheromone 
along the paths. In this approach, learners play the role of ants, scattering trail marks in a proper way according to their learning 
performances along the learning paths characterized by appropriate learning contexts. These trail marks can then be used to 
discover effective learning paths for learners with specific learning styles and competency. 
However, though the research results [6] revealed the theoretical potential of the proposed method in discovering effective 
learning paths for learners, critical limitations arose when considering its application in real world situations, such as the 
requirement of a large amount of learners and a long period of training cycles in order to discover good learning paths for learners. 
That requirement is impractical for large classes in life and the reasonable time for a course to accumulate good learning 
experiences should be as short as possible. Therefore, the aim of this research is to resolve the aforementioned issues by devising 
more efficient algorithms that basically run on the same ant colony model yet requiring only a reasonable number of learners and 
training cycles to find satisfactory good results. 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
In the context of personalized recommendation on the Internet, web usage mining has been used as a potential approach to 
fulfill the requirement of web personalization [4][11][12][13][14][15]. In some commercial applications, the problem is approached 
4 
 
3. THE ANT-COLONY MODEL 
In the following, to facilitate a better understanding of the problem dealt with in this research, we first give a brief explanation 
about the term “learning experience”. Learning experience is defined as the sequence of resource accesses, where resources refer to 
those in a web-based learning platform that are helpful for student learning, such as contents, assessments, learning activities and so 
on. Another term for learning experience we use interchangeably here is “learning path”. Furthermore, “good” learning experiences 
refer to those that can help certain types of students (with specific learning styles and competency) to achieve significant 
improvement in learning performance. In other words, good learning experiences mean different for different types of learners. 
Finally, learning performance is assumed to be measurable by assessment tools such as those developed in [7]. Therefore, the 
“value” of a learning experience can be measured by the degree to which it can help students to improve their learning performance. 
Next, we present the main idea of our approach in the following sections. 
In the context of web-based learning, learners learn through accessing online materials and doing self-assessments to evaluate 
their performance. Learners with different characteristics such as competency and learning styles may need different kinds of 
materials to meet their current learning needs. The problem here is how to provide appropriate recommendations for learners 
matching their individual characteristics so that they can learn to achieve optimal performance.  
In this research, individual characteristics are described in terms of competency and learning styles. As for learning styles, 
categories developed by researchers can be a represented as a discrete symbolic set like {L1, L2, L3, L4} for the Kolb styles [3]. 
Competency is represented as a numerical value, coding the level of a learner‟s proficiency in a certain concept of a specific domain. 
Furthermore, the competency level is divided into a fixed set of linguistic categories using fuzzy classifications. Without loss of 
generality, three linguistic categories of competency are used, that is, the “Novice”, “Experienced” and “Master”. For the limitation 
of the size of the paper, readers could refer to [19] for more details about fuzzy sets.  
The problem is modeled as finding solution paths for different types of learners in a multiple-dimensional knowledge space 
consisting of nodes and edges, dictating the learning paths of learners with particular learning contexts, forming knowledge 
subspaces indexed by competency levels and learning styles. Specifically, each node in a knowledge subspace represents an online 
resource. An edge, labeled as e, linking from one node to another node represents the transition of the corresponding nodes caused 
by accessing a resource e. The knowledge space plays the role of recording, accumulating and sharing learning experiences with 
learner characteristics, including learner competency and learning styles, encoded appropriately. 
For example, consider the knowledge subspaces illustrated in Figure 1, where a learner with learning style Lx and competency 
level c has the fuzzy competency levels represented as μNovice(c) = 0.4, μExperienced(c) = 0.8, andμMaster(c) = 0.2. Suppose the 
learner is now in the knowledge node of {e}. When the learner accesses a resource f, it will lead him to the knowledge node of {f}. 
In this situation, the system will mark the learner‟s trail by adding an edge linking from {e} to {f} with a strength proportional to 
the learner‟s membership in the corresponding knowledge subspaces. After updating the trail marks in the knowledge subspaces, 
the learner‟s current state is relocated at the knowledge node of {f}. This event is called a “local” update of the trails in the 
knowledge subspaces.

whereτ path is a set of pheromone values of the edges in a path, and 

 is the evaporation parameter, and △τ path is the change of 
pheromone values on the edges of the path, which is given by (3):

            (3) 
where △Q is a constant value, and △D increases when the learner‟s performance (effectiveness) in that session is better. The 
effectiveness of a learner‟s performance can be defined in a certain form dependent on applications. For example, the competency 
estimated by the assessment tool developed in [7] can be used to measure the learner‟s performance.  
Now, as far as personalized recommendation is concerned, a knowledge subspace provides recommendations for a learner of 
certain characteristics by considering the membership degree to which s/he belong to it and the knowledge node that s/he is 
currently in. The transitions (resource) that leads out from the current node in each subspace are candidates for recommendation, 
and they are associated with a strength (amount of pheromone) that is computed as the product of the transition strength and the 
membership degree of the learner in the subspace. Different recommendation policies can be used in this phase. For example, 
recommendations can be given by selecting the top R-ranked transitions under the transition strength, where R is a number chosen 
by the system designer. 
4. THE REVISED METHOD 
As shown in [6], the method has the theoretical potential in discovering effective learning paths for learners. Table I shows one 
of the results. 
TABLE I.  NUMBER OF CYCLES REQUIRED FOR DIFFERENT EFFECTIVENESS AND NUMBERS OF LEARNERS [6] 
Effectiveness 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9

500 人 9 11 18 33 45 
1000 人 5 6 10 17 33 
 
However, critical limitations arose when considering its applications in real world situations. For example, in a knowledge 
space consisting irrelevant item resources, the effectiveness of the algorithm is reduced due to exploration of those items. Though 
increasing the number of students might help, it is still impractical for real large classes in life, where the number of students is 
often limited by 200 to 300. Three observations are worth mentioning from the research of [6]: 
1. The more number of virtual ants involved, the sooner the network gets staged (the situation of being unable to improve 
paths easily).

In the program, we predefined a set of “good” learning paths to be found for simulated learners of different competency levels 
and learning styles. The competency of a simulated learner gets an increment to a degree proportional to the similarity between its 
current learning path and the “hidden” good learning paths. The increment of competency will be fed back to the ant colony model 
according to the global update mechanism. In particular, the similarity between a learner‟s learning path and a “hidden” good 
learning path is calculated as follows [5]:

As a result, for a learner with a learning path of mYYYYY ........ i21 , its effectiveness regarding to the hidden good path of 
X=X1X2…Xj…Xn, is defined as (4): 
SimsAAssffctivenese  )(),( 
,          (4) 
whereμA(s) is the degree that the learner belongs to the subspace of competency level of A. 
The simulation program runs iteratively for a number of training cycles, and in each cycle a virtual learner can give a number of 
self-evaluation feedbacks as is given by (4) to the system. The effectiveness of one simulation run is defined as the best similarity 
between user learning paths and the “hidden” good paths. 
6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The simulations are run under different combinations of strategies and parameter settings. Specifically, the ant number can be 
50, 100, and 200; and the GE (Global Evaporation) rate can be 0.01, 0.1 and 0.9; and the goal structure can be single-goal or 
segmented-goal; and the meta-control for search can be fixed or adaptive. The local evaporation rate is set to 0.01 for all 
simulations. All the simulations are run within 100 cycles and three times of intermediate feedbacks for each cycle. The size of the 
search space is determined by 30 resource items with the maximum length of the goal sequence set to 10. 
Figure 3 shows the effectiveness of the algorithm under fixed randomness control, single-goal strategies and no negative 
feedbacks with different number of ants (50, 100, 200) and GE settings (0.01, 0.1, 0.9); while Figure 4 shows the effectiveness of 
the algorithm under fixed randomness control, single-goal strategies but including negative feedbacks with different counter-
settings. The results showed they are comparable under fixed randomness control and single-goal strategies.

Furthermore, Figure 5 shows the effectiveness of the algorithm under “adaptive” randomness control, segmented-goal strategies 
and no negative feedbacks with the counter-parameter settings with different number of ants (50, 100, 200) and GE settings (0.01, 
0.1, 0.9); while Figure 6 shows the effectiveness of the algorithm under adaptive randomness control, single-goal strategies but 
including negative feedbacks with different counter-settings. It can be seen that the latter with negative feedbacks performs better 
than the former under adaptive randomness control and segmented-goal strategies.

To further investigate the effect of the proposed feedback strategy on the effectiveness of the algorithms, look at Figures 7-9. 
From Figures 7 and 8, it can be seen that under the fixed randomness control strategy, the algorithm equipped with segmented-goal 
strategy and negative feedbacks performs best when compared to the other ones.

7. CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION 
In this research, an efficient ACO algorithm is devised to handle the problem of personalized recommendation for Web-based 
learning. It was verified through simulation that the strategies proposed are useful for extracting more effective personalized 
recommendation knowledge with a smaller number of training cycles. This makes our model more suitable for practical situations. 
However, it is noted that fact that the research uses simulation may incur data interpretation problem when consider its application 
is real situations. Besides, the cold-start problem may hinder its application too. All these issues should be considered  in future 
research. In the future, we will conduct experiments on real students to investigate its effectiveness in sharing good learning 
experiences among learners.

learners and the abundance in learning resources, creating a large database tracking 
how users of different learning styles had learnt with the learning resources, and how 
effective they were. Therefore, these databases provide an opportunity to discover 
how people can learn better in the web-based setting. The hidden knowledge could 
also help to provide personal recommendation for people engaged in Web-based 
learning so that they can find appropriate learning resources, which has become a 
popular research subject in the area of adaptive learning. 
The most challenging work in developing adaptive learning systems lies in 
collecting recommendation knowledge for delivering effective personalized resources. 
The sources of such knowledge may come from historical access databases that 
contain abundant learning patterns of numerous users of different learning styles and 
competencies. Several techniques for extracting recommendation knowledge from a 
historical access database are available in the literature, including data mining, 
collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based approaches.  
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extracting recommendation 
knowledge that considers the learning context associated with a learner. This approach 
is inspired by the experience-sharing mechanism of natural ants. Natural ants share 
with each other the paths leading to food by scattering an appropriate amount of 
pheromone along the paths they have explored. It is through this experience-sharing 
mechanism that helps the ants find a good path for them to ship food back home. 
Inspired by the behavior of natural ants, it would be possible to develop a more 
effective adaptive learning system if it can collect good experiences of past learners 
by considering their personal characteristics, such as competency and learning styles, 
and the learning paths they had explored successfully.   
In our approach, learners play the role of ants, scattering an appropriate amount 
of trace marks according to their learning performance along their learning paths 
characterized by specific learning contexts, such as competency and learning styles. 
The more trace marks a contextualized learning path receives, the more effective it is 
for the learners of the corresponding learning context. It can then be used to deliver 
personal recommendation to learners by matching the learner’s context with that of 
the paths. In the following, we present some related researches, which include 
learning styles, recommendation systems, ant colony optimization algorithms and 
fuzzy set theory. Then we present the recommendation model, and finally the 
experimental results and discussions. 
2 Related Work 
2.1 Learning Style 
Learning style means the different ways in which students learn. That is, every 
student has his own way of receiving and processing information. Learning styles can 
investigate what type of learning styles a student has and how students make 
progression during their learning processes. LSI (Learning Style Inventory) is the 
questionnaire developed by Kolb his learning style model. 
Honey and Mumford [20] revised Kolb’s classifications from the perspective of 
business and management. In their model, there are four type of learning styles: 
Activist, Reflector, Theorist and Pragmatist. LSQ (Learning Style Questionnaire) [21] 
is the questionnaire developed for Honey and Mumford’s learning style model. Many 
other researchers have also proposed different learning style model, such as the 
psychological cognition model by Sternberg, the cognition and decision model by 
Myers與 Briggs, and the VARK model by Fleming. Due to the limit of the paper size, 
interested readers are referred to the literature for more detail. We assume that learners 
of different Kolb learning styles need different types of learning content to produce 
better learning for them. 
However, there is dispute on whether learning styles have impact on learning 
performance. Felder and Silverman 錯誤! 找不到參照來源。 argued that a student’s 
learning performance is related to whether an instructor’s teaching styles are well 
matched to student’s learning styles. In particular, it has impact on student learning 
motivation, and a mismatch between the two can even lead students to frustration and 
drop-outs. Therefore, many researchers argue that an instructor should try to grasp the 
learning styles of the students in his class, and adjust his teaching style accordingly to 
promote student learning performance. However, other researchers like Willingham 
錯誤! 找不到參照來源。 argued that there are no sufficient evidences at present showing 
that learning styles have impact on learning outcomes. 
Therefore, it would be helpful to resolve the situation if we can develop a 
knowledge extraction method that extracts effective learning paths from access logs 
by taking into account learning styles, competency, content characteristics and 
learning outcomes, and then investigate and analyze the relation between learning 
styles and learning outcomes. For example, we can understand the relationship 
between learning styles and learning outcomes by investigating whether the same 
learning paths take place in different spaces of learning styles and competency.  
 
2.2 Recommendation System 
In the last decade, recommendation systems have already gained more and more 
widespread usage, whether in the electronic commerce domain or the e-Learning 
areas [5][10][15][16]. Resnick (1997) believed, as the explosion of information due to 
the Internet in modern age, many websites were pondering how to give customers 
appropriate information that meets their true need. Recommendation systems have 
therefore surged under this personal information requirement [2][5]. In the literature 
logical sequence. This is different from traditional data mining techniques which 
focus on discovering frequent “sub-sequences” of events. Nevertheless, it is possible 
to transform the problem of relating sequential events, learner characteristics and 
learning outcomes such that association mining techniques can be applied to solve 
the problem. However, it is still difficult to handle the problem in real-time and 
dynamic recommendation systems. For such applications, incremental data mining 
techniques might be of help [23]。 
 
2.3 The Ant Colony Algorithm 
The ant colony algorithm was developed by Dorigo [9], and is a heuristic 
optimization algorithm, inspired by behavior of natural ants. Natural ants scatter a 
chemical substance, called “pheromone” along the paths they had explored when 
going out searching for food. The ants share with each other the paths leading to 
food through the pheromone scattered along the paths. The whole story starts with 
the ants randomly selecting paths to find food. The ant scatters pheromone all over 
the paths, and the ants following behind choose paths according to the amount of 
pheromone left by earlier ants, while in the mean time scatters pheromone to 
strengthen the pheromone density of the path. On the other hand, pheromone can 
vanish as time goes by. As shown in Figure 2, the shortest path between the food 
and the net lies in the middle part of the figure. Because it is the shortest, after a 
period of time, more ants will pass through it than the other paths. As a result, the 
shortest path will collect more pheromone than others, which in turn reinforce more 
ants to choose the path. With the reinforcement effect, soon all ants will select the 
shortest path. That is why the ant colony algorithm can be used to solve 
optimization problems. 
 
Figure 1.  自然界螞蟻之行為（取材自錯誤! 找不到參照來源。）。 
After observing the communication mechanism of natural ants, we can find that 
knowledge subspaces. 
The traits in the knowledge subspaces are reinforced whenever the situation 
when a user’s competency goes up is confirmed either by a test or by a self-evaluation 
questionnaire. This is called a global update of the traits in the knowledge subspaces. 
 
Figure 2: 
 
Now, as far as content recommendation is concerned, knowledge subspaces will 
produce recommendations of different preferences based on the membership degree to 
which that the user belong to the subspace and the current state of a user. Edges 
(documents) with the strongest strength leading out from the current state in each 
subspace will be delivered to the user.  
Specifically, for a given user x, the local update formula on the pheromone of an 
edge in a subspace S is given by (2):

4.2 Results and Discussion 
(a) Impact of number of users and documents on the performance 
As shown in Table 1, it can be seen that the performance is the best when the 
number of users is maximized and the number of documents is minimized. It implies 
that in practical applications, when the number of users is large, increasing the 
number of documents for different types of users is beneficial for the sharing of good 
learning experiences.

(b) Impact of number of learning rounds on the performance 
In this experiment, 500 users are generated and different numbers of learning 
rounds are tested to investigate their impact on the performance. In each test, we list 
the number of users whose learning paths are similar to the best ones by at least 0.5. 
As a result, it was found that when the number of learning rounds goes up to 9, all the 
simulated users reach the expected learning paths. It seems that when the number of 
users is large, good learning patterns can spread quickly to other users. 
(c) Impact of local pheromone evaporate rate and global evaporate rate  
We conducted a set of experiments for 30 documents and 500 users under local 
/global pheromone evaporate rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9. It was found that the 
performance is the best when local pheromone evaporate rate is 0.1, no matter what 
the global rate is. It implies that a low value of local pheromone is beneficial for
