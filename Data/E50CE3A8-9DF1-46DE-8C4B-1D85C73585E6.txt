ABSTRACT 
Owing to the increasing complexity and size of construction projects, the construction 
market and environment becomes more challenging and a single company can no more 
manage a complex project and satisfy owner’s needs alone.  The strategic alliance between 
companies, which are equipped with different specialties, becomes a critical business model 
to obtain competitive advantages so as to survive in the fiercely competing market. 
While two profit-oriented companies intend to cooperate and form a strategic alliance for 
a particular project, it is relatively easy to divide the work scope based on each party’s 
specialty, but, always difficult to reach an agreement in terms of sharing risks and rewards.  
Since companies are seeking to maximize their own profits in the course of executing the 
project, conflicts between a strategic alliance team and the bargaining are inevitable.  
However, in practices, few rational models are available to assist companies in resolving the 
bargaining problem.  Thus, to satisfy both parties, a bargaining decision support system 
(BDSS) is indeed needed for estimating the rewards of the cooperative parties and is crucial 
for enhancing the possibility of a win-win situation and the success of reaching an agreement 
in the bargaining. 
The main goal of this research is to develop a BDSS and propose real world applications 
in the construction industry.  Based on Dynamics Game Theory, this research is designed to 
discover the bargaining decision factors heuristically anchored in the minds of construction 
managers.  Then, the discovered bargaining decision factors will be used to develop a 
bargaining game model to examine the equilibrium prices under various conditions.  Fuzzy 
set theory will also be adopted to deal with the problem of linguistic variables and judgments 
in the numerical analysis and data transformation of this research.  It is expected that the 
research results can assist companies, who intend to form a strategic alliance, to select a 
proper bargaining strategy.  In addition, the proposed BDSS, which is a structured model, can 
also enhance the learning of business lessons and knowledge accumulations. 
In this research project, we have successfully developed a fuzzy logic enhanced BDSS 
for supporting business pricing decisions in strategic alliance projects.  By following the 
research plan, the potential model applications are also demonstrated by relevant case studies 
and illustrative examples.  The research results are also acknowledged and published in 
international prestigious journals with SSCI/SCI/EI index.

2. The sequential bargaining model 
Game theory has been defined as “the study of mathematical models of conflict and 
cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers” and successfully applied to many 
important issues, such as negotiations, finance, and imperfect markets. It allows researchers to 
find mathematical solutions of conflict situations (Peldschus 2008). Based on the concept of 
dynamic games, the bargaining between two parties of a JV team is modeled as a sequential 
bargaining process. In this model, the JV parties are termed as “players”.   
 
2.1.  Basic symbols and definitions 
In the game theoretical analysis, the rationale of players’ behavior is to maximize their 
payoffs calculated based on quantified considerations and both players are assumed risk 
neutral, while the utility function can be used to modify this model in cases where the players 
have other risk attitudes. Definitions of each basic symbol and assumption in the model are as 
follows: 
 k represents players in the bargaining, while a refers to player A and b refers to player B. 
 n represents round of bargaining. Each player’s offer accounts for a round. 
 E represents total contract amount estimated based on announced budget information and 
market price. The total contract amount is assumed the award price. As agreement is reached, 
the total contract amount is the sum of the payment obtained by player A (a*) and the 
payment obtained by player B (b*). 
 an represents player A’s quotation for its work scope in the nth round. In this model, player A 
makes the first offer, a1, in the 1st round for its work scope.  Further, since both parties take 
turns to offer a price, only when the number of round is odd (n = 1, 3, 5,…)  player A can  
offer its price. 
 bn represents player B’s quotation for its work scope in the nth round. As assumed above, 
first player A offers a1 in the 1st round for its work scope, and then player B may make a 
counteroffer, b2, for its work scope. Since both parties take turns to offer, only when the 
number of round is even (n = 2, 4, 6,…)  player B can  offer its price. 
 Ck represents cost estimated by the player k according to individual work scopes.  Ca 
indicates player A's cost; Cb indicates player B's cost.  Since information associated with 
market prices of materials and labor is quite open, it is assumed in this research that both 
parties in the bargaining can obtain clear awareness of each other’s cost. 
 F represents total profit of the project (total profit plus total cost of the project equals the 
total contract amount). 
 P represents probability of failure in the bargaining.  
 Lk(n) represents the loss of potential profits when agreement is not settled.   
 
2.2. Sequential bargaining process 
In this model, it is assumed that bargaining begins with the offer proposed by player A in 
round 1 (n = 1), and there are three possible reponses from player B: (a) accepts the offer, 
(b)rejects the offer and closes the bargaining, and (c) makes a counteroffer. If player B makes 
a counteroffer, then similarly, player A may accept, reject, or make a counteroffer to player B. 
Usually the bargaining is an offer-counteroffer process till the nth round, when an agreement 
is reached, or the bargaining is given up. Accordingly, different rewards or losses in each 
round are expected (as shown in Fig. 1). At the nth round, it could be player A’s or player B’s 
turn to make the offer. Nevertheless, in the bargaining model shown in Fig. 1, it is assumed 
that it is player A’s turn to propose the offer. 
 
  
(1)  would be accepted by player A, player B’s best offer in the (n-1)th round is as Eqn. (2): 
 
E – an + PLa(n).                                                                                                (2) 
 
Similarly, for player B, in the (n-1)th round, the expected payoff in the (n-1)th round is as 
Eqn. (3): 
 
E – an + PLa(n) – PLb(n-1).                                                                                  (3) 
 
In addition, since player A understands that, in the (n-2)th round, any price higher than 
Eqn. (3) would be accepted by player B, and player A’s offer in the (n-2)th round is as Eqn. 
(4): 
 
an – PLa(n) + PLb(n-1).                                                                                         (4) 
 
Based on the concept of equilibrium, the player cannot produce a price better than an. 
Therefore, the equilibrium price can only be solved when player A’s offer in the nth and (n-
2)th round  is the same as Eqn. (5): 
 
an = an – PLa(n) + PLb(n-1).                                                                                                                                 (5) 
 
Since bargaining between players is a repetitive process of offer-counteroffer, when the 
round of bargaining n→∞, the P in each round will be very close.  Thus, in this model, the 
probabilities of failure in any bargaining round are assumed the same and Eqn. (5) can be 
simplified as Eqn. (6): 
 
La(n) = Lb(n-1).                                                                                                  (6) 
 
2.4. Equilibrium price function 
In this research, Lk(n) is the loss of potential profits in the JV project. However, bargaining 
theory (Bacharach and Edward 1981) suggests that potential profits considered by a player in 
the bargaining should be additional profit which can not be gained from other projects. If a 
player has other opportunities that may earn the same amount of profit, there is no potential 
profit for this project. Therefore, this research developed a variable, need for the project (Sk), 
to encompass the above concept. Losses expected by player A and player B are as Eqn. (7) 
and Eqn. (8) respectively.

It is common that player A and player B of the JV team may invest on different scales. 
Thus, the Lk(n) is evaluated on the unit basis for the sake of fairness. Value of Sk is assumed to 
fall between 0 and 1; the higher the value, the higher the need for the project, and vice versa. 
The value 1 indicates that the player has no other opportunities, which can earn the same 
amount of profit as this project. 0 indicates that the player can earn the same profit from other 
opportunities and does not need the profit at all. 
 
  
company’s “S.” The degree of fulfillment of scheduled revenue target is closely related to 
received revenues and potential business prospects in the future. Moreover, future revenue is 
associated with future business opportunities and the level of competition. Thus, this research 
assumes that a company’s “S” is influenced by three factors, “received revenues”(R), “future 
business opportunities”(O), and “level of competition”(L). 
 
3.2. Fuzzy sets and membership functions 
Both “R” and “O” are evaluated against the company's degree of attainment of its 
scheduled revenue target. For example, if “R”/scheduled revenue target yields a value of 0.95 
(covering 95% of its scheduled revenue target), it is suggested that this company’s “R” is 
rather high. Both “R” and “O” may exceed scheduled revenue target, so values of these two 
items range between 0~2 and are further divided into three degrees of “High”, “Moderate”, 
and “Low”. As for the variable of “L”, the value is represented by “number of competitors”, 
which has been the most frequently used criterion for measurement of competition level in 
previous research. Note that the number of competitors is an adaptive parameter, which is 
adjustable for specific cases in different industries. Lo et al. (2007) have conducted a nation-
wide study on the traffic construction projects in Taiwan and proposes an estimation of the 
number of competitors ranging from 3 to 13. In this research, we took the estimation for the 
demonstration of the fuzzy membership function. Therefore, this research ranges the value of 
“L” from 3 to 15 so as to include some extremely competitive cases (3 competitors is the 
minimum requirement for open bids); higher values indicate higher level of competition, 
which is also divided into three levels of “High”, “Moderate”, and “Low”. “S” is defined in 
the range between 0 and 1, and further divided into three levels of “High”, “Moderate”, and 
“Low”.

Fig. 2. Membership functions of each criterion and output 
 
Membership functions commonly used include triangular functions and bell-shaped 
functions (Yu and Skibniewski 1999). To demonstrate the concept more efficiently, triangular 
functions are used in this research (see Fig. 2). In a triangular membership function, each 
triangular fuzzy number has linear representations on its left and right side such that its 
  
represents that company A takes an optimistic bargaining position and low Sb for pessimistic 
bargaining positions. As shown in Fig. 3, the suggested offer based on different sets of Sb can 
be easily obtained. Similarly, company B can lock Sb (suppose it is 0.41) and infer the 
company A’s possible offers based on different sets of Sa (the rewards willing to share by 
company B in Fig. 3). In this case, once the reward willing to share by company B is more 
than the acceptable reward for company A, the agreement can be made.  
In addition to figure out the possible individual rewards in various bargaining positions, 
the scenario analysis can turn to project level by evaluating the total rewards needed with 
different bargaining positions. As shown in Fig. 4, since the contract amount is fixed, the 
possibility of agreement can be evaluated by comparing the contract amount and the 
acceptable total reward. If both parties take too optimistic bargaining positions, then the 
acceptable total reward might over the contract amount to lower the possibility of agreement. 
Thus, these objective evaluations give each company a clear guideline for pricing. Irrational 
alternatives can be detected and eliminated with the support   of the proposed model and the 
functions can help making rational decisions (Šarka et al. 2008).
