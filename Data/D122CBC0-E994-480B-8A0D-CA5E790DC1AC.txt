技術研發成果說明：
In our studies, when the uncomfortable degree is great 3, the patient was thought
as under a discomfort. The comfort group has 16 patients (49±13 age), discomfort
group has 22 patients(47±15 age). According the patient’s response that had been
shown in Fig. 2, we defined some parameters that had been shown in Tab.1 to
compare the difference between the comfort and discomfort groups. We found that
if the patients have more length response time or high raising HR, the patients will
feel more uncomfortable. The raising HRs of comfort and discomfort groups are
17.5±6.5 and 26.9±9.7 (p<0.05). The response times (comfort group: 141.9±41.1,
discomfort group: 171.9±48.6) also have previously difference.
Moreover, we also compare the difference between the young age (n=21, 37±9
age) and old age (n=17, 60±7 age) groups. The setting level is 50 age. Table 2
shows the results. The raising HRs of young age and old age groups are 26.2±8.9
and 20.6±8.8 (p<0.05). The response times of young age and old age groups
(173.4±46.5, 147.1±43.0, p=0.038) also have previously difference.
