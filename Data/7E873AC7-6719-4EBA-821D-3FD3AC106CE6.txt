 Abstract 
This report presents an analysis of a new type of 
permanent magnet excited transverse flux 
synchronous linear motor (PMTFLM). The 
translator of this new motor consists of 
cross-shaped core sets. Considering parameters 
including air gap length, magnet dimension, pole 
pitch and tooth width of the translator, the thrust is 
analyzed and simulated with 2D model of the 
PMTFLM by using COMSOL Multiphysics that 
leverages the finite element method. Extensive 
simulations were conducted to investigate how the 
motor performs under a variety of parameter 
settings. Accordingly, motor characteristics are 
identified whereby an optimal combination of 
parameter values can be found. The chosen 
parameteric values are then fed back to motor 
design to validate performance improvement.  
 
Keywords: linear motor, transverse flux, 
cross-shaped core, permanent magnet, thrust, finite 
element method analysis. 
 
I. Introduction 
The transverse flux motor has evolved more 
than one century since Morday, a chief engineer of 
the Brush company, patented his transverse flux 
rotary motor in 1895 [1]. 1904 Andree received the 
Germany patent with the title "Travelling Field 
Motor with Movable Inducing Part" [2], which has 
been considered the world first induction linear 
motor of transverse flux type. In addition, 
Laithwaite et al proposed a different type of 
transverse flux induction linear motors in 1971 [3], 
with a focus on making such motors applicable to 
high-speed train driver technology. Thanks to the 
development of power electronics and permanent

III. Thrust Computation 
In this project, the finite element method 
software COMSOL Multiphysics is used to 
calculate the motor thrust. The calculation 
procedure comprises three parts: pre-processing, 
field-solution and post-processing. Pre-processing 
is to establish the geometric model of the linear 
motor and to set material parameters. Due to the 
symmetric of the motor structure, only half of 
them will be selected to calculate the thrust. The 
calculated results are then doubled to obtain the 
total thrust. 
  When the geometric model, material parameters 
and all boundary conditions of the motor are set, 
we proceed to solve a system of equations from the 
grid. In general, the denser grid one selects, the 
more accurate results one can obtain, yet at the 
expense of longer time. One can strike a better 
balance between accuracy and time complexity, 
according to whether the derived result is 
sufficiently acceptable. Subsequent to field 
solution, the third subprocess post-processing 
refers to selecting what metrics to be analyzed. 
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the simulation results 
of magnetic potential and magnetic flux density, 
respectively.

  Motor thrust is generated by the translator 
winding currents, as formulated in Eqs.(1) – (3) 
below: 
 
)sin( 0ϕω += tII mR  (1) 
)
3
2sin( 0ϕπω ++= tII mS   (2)
 
)
3
2sin( 0ϕπω +−= tII mT   (3)
 
Where φ0 denotes the starting phase angle of 
winding current and ω is the frequency. Each 
cross-shaped core is fitted with two winding coils 
so that the translator has a total of 12 winding coils. 
Because the motor windings are fed with a 
three-phase current source, the phase sequence is 
crucial for the windings. The choice of phase 
sequence for translator windings should create 
thrust on every core tooth surface in the same 
direction wherever possible so that the total thrust 
can be maximized. Thus each phase sequence 
combination of 12 windings has relation to 
translator pole pitch. For example, when the 
translator pole pitch is 4/3 times the permanent 
magnet pole pitch, the combination of phase 
sequence for 12 windings on six translator cores is  
 4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be seen that different τ R has an important 
influence on thrust, if the phase sequence is kept 
unchanged. The average thrust ranges between 0 
and 3000 N/m, while the ratio τR/τM is varied 
from 0.5 to 4/3. Therefore, the translator pole pitch 
and the phase sequence of power supply for 
windings must be properly selected. Otherwise the 
motor thrust can become too small to yield enough 
driving force. Fig. 6 also shows that the ratioτR/
τM should not be set to 1.0 because of too large 
cogging force. 
 
B. Influence of Air Gap Length 
If the air gap length changes from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, 
motor thrust within a magnet pole pitch versus air 
gap length is shown in Fig. 7. From the figure it 
can be seen that average thrust decreases almost 
linearly as air gap length grows. This is because the 
magnetic field strength in air gap is inversely 
proportional to the air gap length. In addition, 
when the magnet becomes thicker, its thrust will 
also increase, at the cost of larger volume and 
weight. A compromise between thrust, volume 
and weight should be based on actual demand. 
 
C. Influence of Magnet Width 
Changing magnet width can also affect motor 
thrust. Fig. 8 depicts motor thrust when in case the

Fig.8 : The relationship between  
thrust and magnet width 
 
 
ratio of magnet width to magnet pole pitch (bM/τ
M) varies from 0.5 to 1.0. In the best case the 
average thrust reaches its maximum, if the magnet 
width is equal to the magnet pole pitch. 
 
D. Influence of Translator Tooth Width 
The next simulation is conducted by adjusting 
the ratio bZ/τM of translator tooth widths to 
magnet widths, in the context of fixing the magnet 
pole pitch at 15.0 mm. The motor can not be 
realized when the translator tooth is wider than the 
translator pole pitch. The dependence of thrust on 
the translator tooth width is shown in Fig. 9. 
Fig. 9 indicates that, when the ratio bZ/τM 
grows, motor thrust increases accordingly at the 
first place but later starts declining. Such behavior 
occurs that magnetic flux leakage is becoming to 
increase when the space between translator core

G. Influence of Magnet Pole Pitch 
Supposing that the permanent magnet pole pitch 
is set to 13 to 17 mm, the load peak current is 3 A, 
and the other parameters are drawn from Table 1, 
resulting thrusts are shown in Fig. 13. This figure 
suggests that thrust is kept independent of 
whatever size of magnet pole pitch. Instead, it will 
only change the motor synchronous speed. 
 
H. Relationship between Current Phase  
Angle and Thrust 
The magnetomotive force (mmf) caused by 
translator windings can be calculated from Eq.(4) 
to Eq.(6). It will directly affect the motor thrust. 
The amplitude and the polarity of mmf can be 
controlled by the starting phase angle of winding 
currents, thus influencing motor thrust. Fig. 14 
shows that, given a fixed starting position of the 
translator yet the starting phase angle of winding 
currents varying from 0 to 180 degrees, motor 
thrust will drop from +2428 to -2750 N/m. 
 
 
 
 
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 14 also leads us to conclude two findings. 
First, changing the motion direction of the motor, 
except through the swap of the current phase 
sequence; can also be achieved by control of the 
starting phase angle of winding current. Second, 
the motor can start at any position with maximal 
thrust by exercising some control over starting 
phase angle of winding current. The starting phase 
angle can be calculated by Eq.(7), where x is motor 
location in any position. 
 
 
 
V. Optimization and Selection of Material 
Simulation results of the previous section 
indicate conditions whereupon the motor can 
achieve highest thrust. Accordingly, we set 
parameter values such that motor performance can 
be optimized. Table 2 presents parameter values 
after optimization for this type linear motor.      
Fig. 15 compares thrusts before and after 
optimization. Thrusts in Fig. 15 result from setting 
magnet to 50 mm in length (thrust in actual value), 
under the condition that load current varies from 0 
to 7 A. It is obvious that optimized thrust is 
improved significantly by up to 48%. Meanwhile, 
it is worth mentioning that optimization itself may

PMTFLM with characteristics parameterized as in 
Table 2 is expected to exhibit maximum thrust. In 
addition, the relationship between the starting 
phase angle of winding current and motor thrust 
has also been suggested as an indication of how to 
exercise that can be control of motion direction and 
starting thrust of the motor. 
Other characteristics than thrust such as detent 
force or thermal dissipation are not explored in this 
study. These characteristics warrant closer study 
and require more thorough investigation in the 
future.
