Planned by Rev. Dr. George Leslie Mackay, Oxford College, the first educational institute in 
northern Taiwan, was established in 1882. It is a typical Chinese and Western style architecture with 
rich historical and cultural content, now is a Class 2 national monument, and also the school history 
hall of Aletheia University. Under the support of three years National Science Council Projects, we 
have completed the researches of virtual tour system of Oxford College, and developed a prototype 
of indoor/outdoor positioning supported virtual navigation system. After gaining results and 
experiences from the projects, and for the further research and application of the original research, 
now we integrate the virtual navigation, RFID positioning, navigation recommendation, and 
peer-to-peer researches, the new two-years project is proposed as “Research on Peer-to-peer Virtual 
Navigation System Supporting Positioning and Recommendation Function”. 
 
This project is termed in two years, the first year plan, “Research on A Virtual Navigation 
System Supporting Positioning and Recommendation”, focuses on improving the initiative RFID 
positioning and designing the virtual navigation recommendation system. More efficient navigation 
is expected by analyzing user interest, detecting user position and navigation time, initiatively 
recommending user appropriate navigation route and time. The second year plan, “Research on 
Position and Interest Based Peer-to-peer Virtual Navigation System”, is based on RFID 
positioning research result and navigation recommendation system in the first year, and 
designs the peer-to-peer virtual navigation system based on users’ position and interest, thus 
allowing users to download related virtual scenes and multimedia data more efficiently from 
peers with the common navigation interest, and improve the navigation data transmission 
efficiency.

receives radio wave through RFID, and determines the distance 
between the sending end and the receiving end according to the 
signal strength.  
   L. Ni et al. proposed another well-known active RFID 
positioning system, LANDMARK [2]. It is based on the 
algorithm for converting received signal strength indication 
into distance used by J. Hightower et al. in the SpotON system. 
The LANDMARK system adds a Reference Tag in its location 
environment to help positioning and resolving obstacles in the 
environment, and uses K-nearest neighbor algorithm to screen 
the reference point and improve the execution efficiency. 
Appling the active RFID to positioning systems was proven to 
be feasible, but some problems were yet to be solved, such as 
unstable performance of Tag in signal strength, and the RSSI 
values of the time were simply separated by 8 levels. Thus, 
using only the signal strength value for location seemed to be 
deficient.  
Y. Zhao et al. proposed another positioning system, VIRE [3], 
which incorporates the concept of Reference Tag as in 
LANDMARK. VIRE carries out linear interpolation according 
to signal strength by using the concept of four solid Tags 
enclosing a Grid, the Grid is cut into N x N Virtual Grids. Thus, 
the concept of Virtual Reference Tag is incorporated in 
positioning assistance. VIRE requires lower cost, and improves 
the resistance to environmental noise. More accurate 
positioning value than LANDMARK can be obtained after the 
specific threshold filtering procedure.  
The LEASE positioning system proposed by P. Krishnan et 
al. included reference point in the system, and compared the 
changes in RSS value for positioning [4]. Jin et al. added the 
screening mechanism of Reference Tag in the LANDMARK 
system to improve the positioning effect [5]. Shih determined 
the distance weight based on the signal strength in the system, 
and displayed the position of the object through triangulation 
method [6]. Yang used two-phase cluster algorithm to solve the 
problem in identifying Reference Tag [7]. Jian used TOA–AOA 
location algorithm to determine the time difference of received 
RFID signal and the incidence of signal, so as to improve the 
positioning accuracy [8].  
Many new active RFID positioning systems have been 
proposed in recent years. Jiang et al. published an article on 
LANDMARK system in 2009 [9], which suggests to conduct 
re-positioning by exchanging the Reference Tag with the 
closest Tracking Tag after the first positioning by the 
LANDMARK system. The results showed an improvement of 
the positioning accuracy. Huang et al. also used the concept of 
LANDMARK, but changed the corner positioning of 
LANDMARK system to triangulation method, so as to improve 
the positioning accuracy [10]. Other studies also proposed 
different methods. For example, Chang et al. combined 
ultrasonic to assist in positioning, so as to reduce the error 
values of location [11].  
Based on the above, the main cause for positioning system 
errors is instable RSSI of Tag signal, and it is likely to be 
interfered by environmental factors. Thus, using only signal 
strength for location often results in large errors in location 
[1-12]. Therefore, this paper did not use the signal strength 
value for positioning directly. Since the signal strength of Tag 
would decrease as the distance increased, and considering the 
differences of environment and Tag, it first classified signal 
levels for different Tags at multiple distances, and then used the 
matrix formed by these signal levels and the fault-tolerance 
mechanism for accurate and stable positioning. 
III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
 
            
Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of positioning mode  
 
Figure 1 is the schematic diagram of the positioning mode 
proposed by this paper. The active tags are set in the 
localization environment equally in intervals of 2m at upper, 
lower, left and right side. The suitable signal strength threshold 
for specific Tag is analyzed and stored in the database. When 
users move in the indoor space with mobile device combined 
with RFID Reader, the positioning system compares the 
received Tag signal values with the positioning data in the 
database timely, in order to determine the location of the users.  
The positioning process of this system is shown in Figure 2. 
First, the localization environment is arranged before 
positioning, and the signal strength reference values of specific 
Tag at different distances are analyzed and set. Then, the SLM 
of all sensing areas are set up and stored in the database 
according to the signal strength reference values. During 
real-time positioning, the Reader converts the received signal 
level into SLM timely, and searches the database for identical 
SLM. If an identical SLM is found, the corresponding sensing 
area is displayed directly to finish positioning; if no identical 
SLM is found, the fault-tolerance mechanism is used for 
searching similar SLM to complete positioning; if no similar 
SLM is found, the system returns to the step of analyzing 
signals for re-collection of signals and repositioning.  
As compared with other RFID positioning systems, this 
system only requires one RFID Reader and several Tags to 
complete positioning, and it can reduce the construction cost of 
positioning system effectively. Furthermore, in the proposed 
positioning method, the user carries a RFID Reader, which 
allows the system administrator to know about the user's 
location, and the user can know his location timely. Thus, this 
system can indicate the position of the user timely, and can be 
applied in guides of exhibition halls, museums, airports or 
campuses.

B. SIGNAL LEVEL MATRIX 
Based on the sensing overlap area and the classification of 
signal level, this paper proposed the concept of Signal Level 
Matrix (SLM). First, the signal strength is classified into six 
levels according to the distance between Reader and Tag (as 
shown in Table 1), and then the Signal Level Matrix of the area 
of Reader is set up according to the signal levels of the Tags 
around the Reader.  
 
For example, taking the area shown in Figure 3 as an 
example, the type 1 Signal Level Matrix is set up 
corresponding to the type 1 blocks of Tag22, the main 
characteristic is that it senses Tag22's signal level S22 = L0 (as 
example shown in Figure 4). Eight kinds of type 2 Signal 
Level Matrixes are set up corresponding to the type 2 areas 
within 1 meter around Tag22: A22U, A22D, A22L, A22R, 
A22UL, A22UR, A22DL and A22DR as examples shown in 
Figure 5. The main characteristic is that it senses Tag22's 
signal level S22 = L1, and some other signal's level equals to 
L2, so as to distinguish the direction of signal levels.

In the third situation, if the distance between Reader and all 
Tags is over 1 meter, namely, it is just located among 4 Tags 
(e.g. 4 blocks in Figure 6: A22DRX, A23DLX, A32URX and 
A33ULX), the corresponding Signal Level Matrix can be 
constructed based on the signal strength of peripheral 16 Tags, 
as examples shown in Figure 6. The main characteristic is that 
the four adjacent signal levels are L2; and the level of another 
two signals equals to L3, the level of the signal on the cross 
equals to L5. In addition, if the user is just located in the small 
block between A22DR and A22DRX, the final location will be 
determined by T33's signal strength S33 which may be Level 2 
or Level 3.

C. FAULT-TOLERANCE MECHANISM 
Since the signal strength of Tag often fluctuates within a 
range, the signal strength of adjacent position may fluctuate 
between adjacent signal levels, and then cause errors in 
location. The proposed fault-tolerance mechanism can solve 
this problem. For example, taking the first situation in Figure 7 
as an example, a normal Signal Level Matrix should be as that 
shown in Figure 4, but the fluctuation of signal strength may 
result in non-standard Signal Level Matrix as example shown 
in Figure 7 (a). In this case, as proved by experimental 
experience, since the Reader is very close to Tag22, the signal 
strength of L0 is very stable, so it still can be located at A22 
successfully.  
Taking A22U of the second situation as an example, a 
normal Signal Level Matrix should be as that shown in Figure 
5 (a), but the fluctuation of signal strength may result in 
non-standard Signal Level Matrix as shown in Figure 7 (b). If 
this circumstance happens, although mismatching the standard 
SLM, the position still can be determined according to the 
directionality of signal strength in SLM, and located in the 
area of A22U correctly. Similarly, if a non-standard SLM as 
shown in Figure 7(c) occurs, it can also be located in the area 
of A22UL. In addition, if a non-standard SLM as examples 
shown in Figure 7 (d) and (e) occurs, it can also be located in 
the area of A32URX and A33ULX correctly according to the 
orientation of L5 signal.  
An active RFID CF card Reader with frequency of 2.45GHz 
and 16 active RFID Tags were used in the experiment for 
testing. When proper signal strength thresholds for specific

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we propose the concept of Signal Level 
Matrix (SLM) to develop an active RFID positioning system 
to achieve efficient deployment mode, low cost and high 
accuracy. Based on the characteristic of the signal strength of 
RFID attenuating as the distance increases, this paper first 
classified proper signal levels at different distances and carried 
out indoor localization according to the matrix formed by 
these signal levels. The experimental results indicate that the 
proposed method can adjust the suitable signal strength 
threshold adaptively according to the differences of the 
localization environment and specific Tags. Combined with 
fault-tolerant mechanism, the method can improve the 
positioning accuracy and the stability effectively. 
In addition, this system uses uniform and efficient 
distribution mode, while requiring only one RFID Reader and 
some Tags to complete positioning, thus reducing the cost of 
positioning system effectively. Furthermore, as compared with 
other positioning system, because of the users carry one RFID 
Reader, which allows the system administrator to know about 
the user's location, and the user can know his location, too. 
Thus, this system can indicate the position of the user timely, 
and can be applied in guides of exhibition halls, museums, 
airports or campuses.

Abstract—RFID is the best choice for indoor positioning as it 
attaches equal importance to both accuracy and cost; however, 
with the limited strength stability of RFID signals, coupled 
with interferences of indoor environments and furniture, the 
positioning system based on RFID only is subject to 
bottlenecks, which are difficult to break through for 
positioning accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents an RV-
based indoor positioning and identification system which 
integrating RFID and vision techniques, via cross reference of 
video images, RFID positioning, and ID information, improves 
the accuracy of personnel positioning and possesses the 
function of personnel identification.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Location-based service (LBS) has attracted considerable 
attention in recent years, of which GPS is the best known. It 
has been widely adopted in various applications, such as 
navigational systems for transports like PAPAGO and 
Garmin, and on-line Google and Yahoo maps. However, as 
GPS cannot overcome the problem of indoor veils, studies on 
the context of indoor positioning have emerged. In 
comparison with common indoor positioning systems, such 
as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ultrasounds, and WiMAX, RFID is the 
best choice for indoor positioning as it gives equal attention 
to both accuracy and cost [1].  
At present, studies on indoor positioning based on RFID 
mainly apply four kinds of methods, which are Time of 
Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), 
Received Signal Strength (RSS), and Angle of Arrival 
(AOA). Of these, RSS is most suitable for indoor positioning 
in terms of both cost and accuracy; however, RFID signal 
strength lacks stability, thus, major errors still exist, even 
though RSS is widely adopted.  
Although RFID can be applied to indoor positioning, 
with the limited strength stability of RFID signals, coupled 
with interference from indoor environments and furniture, 
positioning systems based on RFID are subject to bottlenecks, 
which can be difficult to break through for positioning 
accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a more accurate 
indoor positioning system integrating video image analysis 
and active RFID technology. 
As image processing techniques are improved, image 
analysis techniques have been widely applied in a variety of 
fields, such as monitoring and tracking, personnel 
identification, and interactive amusement; however, there 
remains some problems in real-time object identification and 
dynamic tracking. Although the object identification 
technique commonly used in face identification, hand 
identification, body identification, and object identification is 
now mature, accurate identification of persons or objects 
often require intensive preamble information training, with 
subsequent identifications requiring the same complex 
calculation, which takes time.  
Taking the personnel tracking system as an example, 
most current personnel tracking techniques can identify 
personnel within scenes, and continue tracking and recording 
their movement paths, which achieves real-time tracking 
effects; however, when personnel are staggered or 
superimposed, wrong judgments readily occur; at this point 
face identification or apparel identification is required in 
order to continue personnel tracking. When faces cannot be 
photographed or adequate personnel features cannot be 
acquired, personnel tracking may not be able to provide clear 
identification.  
In particular, the most important thing for a good 
positioning system is its real-time capability. Therefore, if 
accurate identification of personnel takes too long for image 
identification, immediate addressing would be rendered 
impossible. This paper presents an RFID and vision Based 
(named as RV-based) positioning and identification system, 
which combines active RFID and vision analysis techniques, 
and through cross referencing with video images and RFID 
positioning information, improves positioning accuracy, and 
possesses personnel identification and positioning functions 
based on the ID identification functions of RFID.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II introduces related works on indoor positioning, 
including RFID-based positioning systems, vision analysis, 
and tracking. Section III describes the RFID positioning 
mechanism of the system proposed in this paper. Section IV 
explains the vision positioning principles and methods of the 
system. Section V deals with the fusing mode and flow of 
RFID positioning, as well as vision positioning. Section VI 
analyzes and compares the experimental results of the system. 
Section VII presents brief conclusions. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
Research issues on indoor positioning attracted attention 
after it was proposed by J. Hightower et al. in SpotON [2]. 
The SpotON system converted GPS positioning into indoor 
positioning, used the calculation mode of converting 
received signal strength value into distance value, and 
adopted several methods for indoor positioning. Of these

strength intervals for each tag (TABLE I), which are used as 
future reference for judgments of sensing areas, thus, 
improving positioning stability. 
B. Analysis of Sensing Overlap Areas  
As shown in Figure 3, one active RFID tag is arranged at 
2m intervals. The sensing range uses tag positions as the 
center, and 2m as the radius divides positioning spaces into 
several independent sensing overlapped areas (as shown in 
Figure 3). Afterwards, the positioning of sensing overlapped 
areas can be completed, via analysis of the signal levels of 
adjacent tags.  
In Figure 3, the purple block denotes that the positioning 
is nearest to a certain tag, thus, the signal strength of a 
certain adjacent tag reaches L0; the blue block denotes that 
the signal strength of both Tag 2 and Tag 5 fail to reach L0

the yellow block denotes that the signal strength of Tag 5 
reaches L1, that of Tag 6 and Tag 8 reaches L2, while that of 
other tags fails to reach L2; the green block denotes that the 
signal strength of Tag 4, Tag 5, Tag 7, and Tag 8 reaches L2, 
while that of other tags fail to reach L2. After sensing 
overlap areas are positioned, the centers of all blocks are 
taken as positioning points in order to complete the 
positioning of relative positions. The results are then 
integrated with vision analysis results.

IV. VISION POSITIONING MECHANISM 
For the vision positioning mechanism discussed in this 
paper, only a generic web video camera must be erected in 
the positioning scene in order to acquire real-time images 
from the scene. Then, the background subtraction method is 
used to analyze both background and foreground images, 
followed by the separation of the personnel being tracked. 
Finally, personnel coordinates are calculated, which are cross 
referenced with RFID positioning information, thus, 
obtaining complete personnel positioning and ID information. 
The study mainly involves (A) Analysis of Foreground and 
Background, (B) Personnel Detection, and (C) Coordinate 
Transformation, all of which are briefly described as follows.  
A. Analysis of Foreground and Background: 
 The background subtraction method is used to separate 
foreground and background objects from the images (as 
shown in Figure 4a). First, the scene, in which no any object 
enters, is established as the background; then, after an object 
starts to enter the scene, each image is compared with the 
background; finally, the person being tracked is extracted (as 
shown in Figure 4b). 
B. Personnel Detection:  
Object images captured, via the background subtraction 
method, will contain some noise. This system uses the 
methods of Erosion and Dilation to remove noise and 
improve signal strength, further analyzing the person being 
tracked (as shown in Figure 4c).  
C. Coordinate Transformation:  
Although the coordinates are extracted from the person 
being tracked, as the video camera must angularly deviate 
from the environment when erected, such coordinates must 
be transformed to actual coordinate positions [15].

V. FUSION OF RFID AND VISION POSITIONING 
 
Figure 5: Schematic diagram of fusion flow of  
RV-based positioning system 
Fusion flow of active RFID positioning and vision 
positioning, as proposed by this paper, is shown in Figure 5. 
In an RFID positioning system, several active RFID tags are 
first arranged in the scene, and then, a mobile Reader is used 
to read the tags in the scene, followed by an analysis of the 
signal strength level of all tags. Positioning blocks are 
defined based on analyzed data and stored in the database. 
After initialization is complete, a mobile Reader, carried by 
the user, is used to receive the signals of active tags in the 
scene, which are immediately addressed, and received 
signals are compared with signal strength information in the 
database, thus, realizing initial positioning of RFID.  
In the vision analysis system, a web camera is first used 
to capture real-time images; then positioning information of 
moving personnel is obtained from analysis of real-time 
images, which is converted into absolute coordinates of the 
personnel in the scene via coordinate transformation; finally,

Abstract—RFID is the best choice for indoor positioning as it 
attaches equal importance to both accuracy and cost; however, 
with the limited strength stability of RFID signals, coupled 
with interferences of indoor environments and furniture, the 
positioning system based on RFID only is subject to 
bottlenecks, which are difficult to break through for 
positioning accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents an RV-
based indoor positioning and identification system which 
integrating RFID and vision techniques, via cross reference of 
video images, RFID positioning, and ID information, improves 
the accuracy of personnel positioning and possesses the 
function of personnel identification. 
Keywords- RFID; vision; positioning; localization 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Location-based service (LBS) has attracted considerable 
attention in recent years, of which GPS is the best known. It 
has been widely adopted in various applications, such as 
navigational systems for transports like PAPAGO and 
Garmin, and on-line Google and Yahoo maps. However, as 
GPS cannot overcome the problem of indoor veils, studies on 
the context of indoor positioning have emerged. In 
comparison with common indoor positioning systems, such 
as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ultrasounds, and WiMAX, RFID is the 
best choice for indoor positioning as it gives equal attention 
to both accuracy and cost [1].  
At present, studies on indoor positioning based on RFID 
mainly apply four kinds of methods, which are Time of 
Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), 
Received Signal Strength (RSS), and Angle of Arrival 
(AOA). Of these, RSS is most suitable for indoor positioning 
in terms of both cost and accuracy; however, RFID signal 
strength lacks stability, thus, major errors still exist, even 
though RSS is widely adopted.  
Although RFID can be applied to indoor positioning, 
with the limited strength stability of RFID signals, coupled 
with interference from indoor environments and furniture, 
positioning systems based on RFID are subject to bottlenecks, 
which can be difficult to break through for positioning 
accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a more accurate 
indoor positioning system integrating video image analysis 
and active RFID technology. 
As image processing techniques are improved, image 
analysis techniques have been widely applied in a variety of 
fields, such as monitoring and tracking, personnel 
identification, and interactive amusement; however, there 
remains some problems in real-time object identification and 
dynamic tracking. Although the object identification 
technique commonly used in face identification, hand 
identification, body identification, and object identification is 
now mature, accurate identification of persons or objects 
often require intensive preamble information training, with 
subsequent identifications requiring the same complex 
calculation, which takes time.  
Taking the personnel tracking system as an example, 
most current personnel tracking techniques can identify 
personnel within scenes, and continue tracking and recording 
their movement paths, which achieves real-time tracking 
effects; however, when personnel are staggered or 
superimposed, wrong judgments readily occur; at this point 
face identification or apparel identification is required in 
order to continue personnel tracking. When faces cannot be 
photographed or adequate personnel features cannot be 
acquired, personnel tracking may not be able to provide clear 
identification.  
In particular, the most important thing for a good 
positioning system is its real-time capability. Therefore, if 
accurate identification of personnel takes too long for image 
identification, immediate addressing would be rendered 
impossible. This paper presents an RFID and vision Based 
(named as RV-based) positioning and identification system, 
which combines active RFID and vision analysis techniques, 
and through cross referencing with video images and RFID 
positioning information, improves positioning accuracy, and 
possesses personnel identification and positioning functions 
based on the ID identification functions of RFID.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II introduces related works on indoor positioning, 
including RFID-based positioning systems, vision analysis, 
and tracking. Section III describes the RFID positioning 
mechanism of the system proposed in this paper. Section IV 
explains the vision positioning principles and methods of the 
system. Section V deals with the fusing mode and flow of 
RFID positioning, as well as vision positioning. Section VI 
analyzes and compares the experimental results of the system. 
Section VII presents brief conclusions. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
Research issues on indoor positioning attracted attention 
after it was proposed by J. Hightower et al. in SpotON [2]. 
The SpotON system converted GPS positioning into indoor 
positioning, used the calculation mode of converting 
received signal strength value into distance value, and 
adopted several methods for indoor positioning. Of these

strength intervals for each tag (TABLE I), which are used as 
future reference for judgments of sensing areas, thus, 
improving positioning stability. 
B. Analysis of Sensing Overlap Areas  
As shown in Figure 3, one active RFID tag is arranged at 
2m intervals. The sensing range uses tag positions as the 
center, and 2m as the radius divides positioning spaces into 
several independent sensing overlapped areas (as shown in 
Figure 3). Afterwards, the positioning of sensing overlapped 
areas can be completed, via analysis of the signal levels of 
adjacent tags.  
In Figure 3, the purple block denotes that the positioning 
is nearest to a certain tag, thus, the signal strength of a 
certain adjacent tag reaches L0; the blue block denotes that 
the signal strength of both Tag 2 and Tag 5 fail to reach L0 
but achieve L1, while that of the other tags fails to reach L2; 
the yellow block denotes that the signal strength of Tag 5 
reaches L1, that of Tag 6 and Tag 8 reaches L2, while that of 
other tags fails to reach L2; the green block denotes that the 
signal strength of Tag 4, Tag 5, Tag 7, and Tag 8 reaches L2, 
while that of other tags fail to reach L2. After sensing 
overlap areas are positioned, the centers of all blocks are 
taken as positioning points in order to complete the 
positioning of relative positions. The results are then 
integrated with vision analysis results.

IV. VISION POSITIONING MECHANISM 
For the vision positioning mechanism discussed in this 
paper, only a generic web video camera must be erected in 
the positioning scene in order to acquire real-time images 
from the scene. Then, the background subtraction method is 
used to analyze both background and foreground images, 
followed by the separation of the personnel being tracked. 
Finally, personnel coordinates are calculated, which are cross 
referenced with RFID positioning information, thus, 
obtaining complete personnel positioning and ID information. 
The study mainly involves (A) Analysis of Foreground and 
Background, (B) Personnel Detection, and (C) Coordinate 
Transformation, all of which are briefly described as follows.  
A. Analysis of Foreground and Background: 
 The background subtraction method is used to separate 
foreground and background objects from the images (as 
shown in Figure 4a). First, the scene, in which no any object 
enters, is established as the background; then, after an object 
starts to enter the scene, each image is compared with the 
background; finally, the person being tracked is extracted (as 
shown in Figure 4b). 
B. Personnel Detection:  
Object images captured, via the background subtraction 
method, will contain some noise. This system uses the 
methods of Erosion and Dilation to remove noise and 
improve signal strength, further analyzing the person being 
tracked (as shown in Figure 4c).  
C. Coordinate Transformation:  
Although the coordinates are extracted from the person 
being tracked, as the video camera must angularly deviate 
from the environment when erected, such coordinates must 
be transformed to actual coordinate positions [15].
