2. Abstract 
The main objective of this research project is 
to employ the purified hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as 
a reaction stimulator or oxidizer for assisting 
sub-lean limit combustion and to achieve the goal 
of energy savings and pollutant reductions. 
However, the applications of hydrogen peroxide 
assisted sub-lean limit combustion to practical 
combustion systems strongly rely on fundamental 
understanding of the characteristics of hydrogen 
peroxide combustion. The main focus of the present 
proposal is to thoroughly investigate the detailed 
chemical kinetics, flame stability limits, flame 
structures, and pollutant formation mechanisms of 
hydrogen peroxide assisted lean combustion 
through experimental investigations and numerical 
simulations. The work of this year is to numerically 
investigate the effects of hydrogen peroxide 
addition on the reaction path, laminar burning 
velocity, flame structure, and pollutant formation 
using the CHEMKIN Collection in conjunction 
with GRI-Mech 3.0 chemical kinetic mechanisms. 
Experimental investigations will be performed in 
the second and third years.

3. Introduction 
Lean combustion is generally considered as 
one of the timely solutions for the more stringent 
environmental regulations and global warming 
concerns in the new century. However, lean 
combustion suffers from combustion instability, 
such as flame pulsation, flame flickering and 
blowout, due to low heat release rate and high local 
extinction. In addition, it is generally accompanied 
with incomplete combustion with high CO and 
UHC (unburned hydrocarbon) emissions in most 
lean combustion applications. Therefore, the key 
problem for lean combustion applications is to 
enhance combustion for flame stabilization and for 
complete combustion to avoid high CO and UHC 
emissions [1-2]. Some strategies for stabilizing lean 
premixed flames and extending lean flammability 
limit have been proposed and extensively studied 
for decades [1-3]. Particularly, feasible and 
pragmatic approaches to extend lean flammability 
limit can be roughly summarized into three 
categories: (i) flow structure adjustment [3-5], (ii) 
increase in temperature and pressure of flow fields 
[6-8], and (iii) alteration in flame chemical 
properties [9-14]. Utilizing swirler and bluff body 
to generate recirculation zone for enhancing flow 
residence time and fuel-air mixing is a promising 
 3
mechanism composing of 53 chemical species and 
325 reaction steps and detailed transport properties 
are used without any modifications. The reaction 
mechanism also includes the formation of NOx. 
This mechanism has been used satisfactorily to 
simulate non-catalytic H2O2 decomposition [24]. At 
the cold boundary, the unburned reactants are 
supplied at 423 K and 1 atm. This temperature 
presets at the boiling temperature of H2O2 and it is 
expected that all reactants are in gas phase. To 
further study into the role of hydrogen peroxide in 
the combustion enhancement of premixed methane 
flames,  numerical simulations are performed for 
two different characteristic types of hydrogen 
peroxide addition: (1) as the oxidizer substituent by 
partial replacement of air (2) as the oxidizer 
supplier by using different concentrations of H2O2. 
Decomposition of one mole H2O2 can produce half 
mole O2 and one mole H2O. Therefore, the 
stoichiometric CH4/H2O2 ratio is 0.25 and the 
global reaction is defined as: 
4 2 2 2 2CH +4H O CO +6H O                   (2) 
In the case of partially replacing air by H2O2, 
the total O2 amount is maintained to keep the 
equivalence ratio constant. Therefore, the reduced 
amount of O2 from air is supplied from the 
decomposition of H2O2. For a stoichiometric 
condition, the reaction is defined as: 
4 2 2 2 2 2 2CH 4 H O (2 2 )(O 3.76N ) CO (4 2)H O         
                        23.76(2 2 )N    (3) 
where α is the replacement percentage of air by 
H2O2. The reduction of air leads to reduction of N2 
in the oxidizer stream. For cases of using H2O2 as 
the oxidizer, the volumetric concentration of H2O2 
is considered ranging from 30% to 100%. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
5.1 Effects of H2O2 on combustion characteristics 
In order to examine the effects of H2O2 on 
enhancement of premixed methane flames and to 
study further into the modification of combustion 
characteristics, the results of premixed 
stoichiometric CH4/air and CH4/80% air + 20% 
H2O2 are compared for illustration. The spatial 
coordinate ranges from cold boundary to 0.4 cm 
within the flame. The resultant temperature and 
species concentration profiles are shown in Fig. 1. 
Results indicate that the premixed flame with 20% 
air replaced by hydrogen peroxide has a higher 
adiabatic flame temperature due to the reduction of 
nitrogen dilution and heat release from thermal 
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The 
temperature increases approximately by 140 K as 
compared to the pure air case. For pure air case, the 
reactant CH4 is completely consumed within 1.0 
mm of the spatial coordinate but 0.85 mm for the 
20% H2O2 replacement case. Hydrogen peroxide 
dedicates to enhance the methane consumption. In 
addition, the increase of H2O2 content in air 
obviously results in an increase of H2O production 
due to the product of H2O2 decomposition. It 
appears to slightly decrease CO2 formation and 
increase CO formation. Besides, some intermediate 
radicals, such as OH, H and O, show increasing 
trends with hydrogen peroxide addition. Especially, 
the increasing trends of HO2, HCO, CH2O and 
CH3O are more significant. These facts suggest that 
the dominant reactions of methane combustion are 
altered by H2O2 addition. Hydrogen peroxide 
decomposition increases the active radicals, 
enhances the reaction rate, and then accelerates the 
laminar burning velocity. The computed laminar 
burning velocity of stoichiometric CH4/air with the 
inlet temperature 423 K is about 0.71m/s, while the 
flame speed is increased to about 1.25 m/s when 
20% air is replaced by H2O2. 
5.2 Laminar burning velocity 
Figure 2 shows the effect of partial 
replacement of air by H2O2 on the laminar burning 
velocity and adiabatic flame temperature for three 
different equivalence ratios (ER). The maximum 
percentage of air replaced by H2O2 is 100%. It can 
be seen that the laminar burning velocity is 
increased with increasing the equivalence ratio and 
the percentage of hydrogen peroxide replacement. 
However, the effect of equivalence ratio on flame 
speed becomes mild for high hydrogen peroxide 
replacement percentage cases. When air is 
completely replaced by H2O2, the laminar burning 
velocity approaches 4.7 m/s for all equivalence 
ratio conditions. This is because that the oxidizer is 
completely provided from decomposition of 
hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide 
dominates the reaction rate of methane oxidation. 
Figure 2 also shows that the adiabatic flame 
temperature increases with increasing the 
percentage of H2O2 replacement. The temperature 
increase for fuel lean conditions is larger than that 
for stoichiometric condition. The maximum 
temperature increase is up to 900 K for ER = 0.6, 
but 680 K and 520 K for ER = 0.8 and 1.0, 
respectively. The effect of temperature increase is 
primarily induced from the heat release of hydrogen 
peroxide decomposition since it is much higher than 
that released from methane reactions. Table 1 shows 
the maximum heat release rates (HRR) for different 
reactant conditions. The maximum heat release 
rates are about 6.09×109 J/m3-s and 1.04×109 J/m3-s 
for ER = 1.0 and 0.6 CH4/air flames, respectively. 
For the case of CH4/50% H2O2 + 50% air the

7. Self Evaluation 
In this project, numerical investigations of the 
effects of hydrogen peroxide addition on the 
reaction path, laminar burning velocity, flame 
structure, and pollutant formation have been made 
as they were proposed in the proposal. Numerical 
simulations used the CHEMKIN Collection in 
conjunction with GRI-Mech 3.0 chemical kinetic 
mechanisms. Results of this year’s research have 
been published in International Journal of 
Hydrogen Energy (see Appendix). Experimental 
investigations will be performed in the second and 
third years.

Hydrogen peroxide is generally considered to be an effective combustion promoter for
different fuels. The effects of hydrogen peroxide on the combustion enhancement of
premixed methane/air flames are investigated numerically using the PREMIX code of
Chemkin collection 3.5 with the GRI-Mech 3.0 chemical kinetic mechanisms and detailed
transport properties. To study into the enhancement behavior, hydrogen peroxide is used
for two different conditions: (1) as the oxidizer substituent by partial replacement of air and
(2) as the oxidizer supplier by using different concentrations of H2O2. Results show that the
laminar burning velocity and adiabatic flame temperature of methane flame are signifi-
cantly enhanced with H2O2 addition. Besides, the addition of H2O2 increases the CH4
consumption rate and CO production rate, but reduces CO2 productions. Nevertheless,
using a lower volumetric concentration of H2O2 as an oxidizer is prone to reduce CO
formation. The OH concentration is increased with increasing H2O2 addition due to
apparent shifting of major reaction pathways. The increase of OH concentration signifi-
cantly enhances the reaction rate leading to enhanced laminar burning velocity and
combustion. As to NO emission, using H2O2 as an oxidizer will never produce NO, but NO
emission will increase due to enhanced flame temperature when air is partially replaced by
H2O2.

diesel exhaust gas. In addition, Born and Peters [24] found
that proper injection of hydrogen peroxide into a diesel
engine reduced soot and NOx drastically. Martinez et al. [25]
reported that the concentrations of UHC, CO and NOx from
their industrial pilot plant combustion chamber fueled with
natural gas were lowered significantly by injection of a few
hundred ppm of hydrogen peroxide. Based on the above
studies, promotion to stable lean combustion seems effec-
tive with the addition of hydrogen peroxide than that with
hydrogen. Hydrogen is usually considered as an easily
ignitable fuel and helpful for enhancing combustion.
Nevertheless, hydrogen peroxide was also shown to act as
a gas catalyst, to shift chemical pathways, and to further
enhance chemical radicals [21].
Although the effects of hydrogen peroxide on combustion
enhancement have been reported, systematic studies of the
roles of hydrogen peroxide in combustion enhancement have
not yet been conducted. Therefore, in the present study, the
effects of hydrogen peroxide on premixed methane/air reac-
tion pathway, laminar burning velocity, adiabatic flame
temperature, and species formation are investigated
numerically using the PREMIX code of Chemkin collection 3.5
with the GRI-Mech 3.0 chemical kinetic mechanisms [26] and
detailed transport properties.
2. Numerical model and chemical
mechanism
In this work, the PREMIX code of CHEMKIN Collection is used
to calculate the adiabatic, unstrained, free propagation
velocities of the laminar premixed CH4/air/H2O2 flames. It
solves the equations governing steady, isobaric, quasi-one-
dimensional flame propagation. The equations are written

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of H2O2 on combustion characteristics
In order to examine the effects of H2O2 on enhancement of
premixed methane flames and to study further into the
modification of combustion characteristics, the results of
premixed stoichiometric CH4/air and CH4/80% air þ 20%
H2O2 are compared for illustration. The spatial coordinate
ranges from cold boundary to 0.4 cm within the flame. The
resultant temperature and species concentration profiles
are shown in Fig. 1. Results indicate that the premixed flame
with 20% air replaced by hydrogen peroxide has a higher
adiabatic flame temperature due to the reduction of
nitrogen dilution and heat release from thermal decompo-
sition of hydrogen peroxide. The temperature increases
approximately by 140 K as compared to the pure air case.
For pure air case, the reactant CH4 is completely consumed
within 1.0 mm of the spatial coordinate but 0.85 mm for the
20% H2O2 replacement case. Hydrogen peroxide dedicates to
enhance the methane consumption. In addition, the
increase of H2O2 content in air obviously results in an
increase of H2O production due to the product of H2O2

than that of CH4/air flame for three different equivalence
ratios, but the adiabatic flame temperature is lower than
that of CH4/air flame. For the case of ER ¼ 1.0 the tempera-
ture difference between two cases is about 250 K. However,
for the case of ER ¼ 0.6, the adiabatic flame temperature is
almost the same as that of CH4/air flame and the tempera-
ture difference is only 10 K. In addition, the laminar burning
velocity is increased to 0.63 m/s, which is much higher than
that of CH4/air flame (0.27 m/s). When the H2O2 concentra-
tion is increased to 40 vol.%, the adiabatic flame temperature
is higher than that of pure CH4/air flame for three different
equivalence ratios. Comparisons of Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that
using H2O2 with various concentrations as an oxidizer the
role of fuel equivalence ratio on the laminar burning velocity
and adiabatic flame temperature becomes less important.
In order to understand the effect of chemical reaction on
the flame speed of CH4/air/H2O2 flames, the first-order sensi-
tivity analysis of laminar burning velocity is shown in Fig. 4 for
different reactant compositions at stoichiometric condition.
In the case of pure air, the dominant reactions for laminar
burning velocity are,
O2 þH4OþOH (R38)
Hþ CH3 þM4CH4 þM (R52)
OHþ CO4Hþ CO2 (R99)
For the hydrogen peroxide replacement cases, the domi-
nant reactions shift to the following chemical steps:
O2 þH4OþOH (R38)
2OHþM4H2O2 þM (R85)
OHþH2O24HO2 þH2O (R89)
OHþ CH44CH3 þH2O (R98)
Among these reactions, (R85) and (R89) are the most
important chemical reactions. Hydrogen peroxide promotes
the product of OH radical, so that hydrogen peroxide modifies
the reaction pathway, and significantly enhances the reaction
rate leading to flame speed enhancement. The effect of
hydrogen peroxide on OH radical is further discussed in the
next section.
3.3. Major species and OH radical
The effects of H2O2 on the major species and OH radical of the
CH4/air/H2O2 premixed flames are investigated. In the study,
the CH4 reactant concentration is changed with different
percentages of hydrogen peroxide additions, and it affects the
concentration of carbon-related species in the products [29].
Normalization of concentration of the carbon-related species is
performed to eliminate this problem by the following formula,
Fig. 7 e Effect of H2O2 on H2O mass fraction for two cases. (a) replacing partial air by H2O2 and (b) H2O2 as oxidizer with
different concentrations.

trend can be clearly revealed. In stoichiometric (ER ¼ 1.0) and
fuel lean (ER ¼ 0.6) conditions earlier accomplishment of
complete methane consumptions is noted with increasing
hydrogen peroxide replacement percentage. Similarly,
increasing the hydrogen peroxide concentration also
enhances rapid methane consumption in both stoichiometric
and fuel lean conditions, except for the case of 30 vol.% H2O2
in stoichiometric condition. Fig. 6 shows the normalized CH4
consumption rate for different reactant conditions at stoi-
chiometric. With the increase of hydrogen peroxide addition,
the total consumption rate of CH4 is obviously increased. The
primary CH4 consumption reactions are,
Oþ CH44OHþ CH3 (R11)
Hþ CH44H2 þ CH3 (R53)
OHþ CH44CH3 þH2O (R98)
The main reactions for CH4 consumption are the abstrac-
tion reactions initiated by radicals, such as H, O, and OH and
yield CH3. Reaction (R98) is the principal reaction for CH4
consumption rate. Since hydrogen peroxide increases the
production of O, H, and OH radicals, the reactions (R11), (R53),
and (R99) are then enhanced to promote CH4 consumption.
Fig. 7 shows the effect of H2O2 on H2O mass fraction for
ER¼ 1.0 ad 0.6. Since H2O2 decomposes to O2 and H2O, the H2O
in product gas is primarily from H2O2 decomposition and
secondarily from the CH4 combustion. It appears that the
mass fraction of H2O increases with increasing H2O2 in the
reactant. However, in the cases of using H2O2 as an oxidizer
with various concentrations, the lower H2O2 concentration
means more water vapor will be produced in the product
stream. It turns out that H2O mass fraction increases with
decreasing H2O2 volumetric concentration.
The normalized CO2 mass fraction profiles with different
H2O2 concentrations for ER ¼ 1.0 and 0.6 are shown in Fig. 8.
The rise of CO2 production curve shifts upstream, especially
for ER¼ 0.6. In the case of hydrogen peroxide replacement, the
normalized mass fraction of CO2 is obviously decreased with
increasing H2O2 for ER ¼ 1.0. Nonetheless, for ER ¼ 0.6, the
decrease of CO2 mass fraction is not obvious when the
hydrogen peroxide replacement is below 30% in total air. In
the case of using different concentrations of H2O2 as the
oxidizer, CO2 mass fraction is also decreased with increasing
H2O2 concentration. However, CO2 mass fraction with 30%vol.
concentration of H2O2 is less than that of pure air case for
ER ¼ 1.0. For ER ¼ 0.6, the decrease of CO2mass fraction is also
not obvious when the hydrogen peroxide concentration is
below 30% in volume.
CO and CO2 are the main carbon-related products in CH4
flames. The decrease of CO2 production is often accompanied
with the increase of CO production. Both of them have a trade
off tendency. Therefore, the normalized CO mass fraction
obviously increases with H2O2 addition. Fig. 9 shows the effect
of H2O2 on normalized CO mass fraction or ER ¼ 1.0 and 0.6.
Similar to CO2 effect, with H2O2 addition, CO production shifts
upstream, especially for ER ¼ 0.6. The CO concentration
increases drastically in the preheat zone and then decreases
in the reaction zone. The replacement of partial air with H2O2
increases the peak of CO concentration. It also increases the
CO formation in the post reaction zone except in the lower
H2O2 concentration (30%). Fig. 10 shows the normalized CO
production rate for different reactant conditions. The domi-
nant reactions for CO production are,

where yNO,n is the mass fraction or the rate of production of
NO in flame n, yNO (air) is the mass fraction or the rate of
production of NO in pure air case, and yCH4 ðnÞ is in flame n.
Since there is no nitrogen in the oxidizer, using different
volumetric concentrations of H2O2 as the oxidizer is unable to
produce NO emission. As to the cases of hydrogen peroxide
replacement, NO production increases with H2O2 enrichment.
The higher adiabatic flame temperature leads to higher yield
of thermal NOx, so that NO emission formation overwhelms
the benefit on reduction of N2 reactant reduction. The
normalized NOmass fraction always gradually increases with
increasing H2O2 addition and it represents the existence of
H2O2 in hydrocarbon flame may accelerate thermal NO
formation due to inherently high flame temperature.
Fig. 14 shows the normalized NO production rate for
various reactant conditions. The total production rate of NO is
increased with the increase of H2O2 addition. The dominant
reactions for NO production are,
NþO24NOþH (R179)
NþOH4NOþH (R180)
HO2 þNO4OHþNO2 (R186)
NO2 þH4NOþOH (R189)
OþNH4HþNO (R190)
HþHNO4H2 þNO (R214)
CH2 þNO4HþHNCO (R249)
It can be seen that reactions (R179), (R180), (R190), (R214),
and (R249) dominate at high temperature zone and reactions
(R186) and (R189) dominate at lower temperature zone. With
the addition of H2O2, the flame temperature increases and
