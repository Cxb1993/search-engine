English Abstract
Keywords: developmental coordination disorder, motor planning, motor learning, motor control
A deficit in motor skills of DCD children may be attributable in part to deficits in internal
models for planning object-related actions. From the conception of open- or closed-loop
control, feedforward (open-loop) and feedback (close-loop) paradigm are usually utilized to
lighten the features of motor control deficits. We investigated the characteristics of motor
control in DCD children. The experimental apparatuses for grip force control were constructed.
Both control paradigms were conducted on normal and DCD groups. Compared to controls,
DCD children exerted increased grip forces. Our findings suggest that DCD affect the
processing of predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of inertial loads. Incorrect
timing was also obviously noted especially in fast speed movements. Our results add further
evidence to the theoretical concept that the DCD impairs internal feedforward function. The
observed dissociation of performance deficits may have direct clinical implication and may
guide the development of individual therapeutic strategies for children with DCD.
Introduction
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) uses the term “Developmental coordination 
disorder”(DCD) to describe children of normal intelligence, free of neurological diseases and
pervasive developmental disorders, those who lack the motor coordination necessary to
perform age-matched motor tasks (APA, 2000). It has been quoted a 6% prevalence of
school-aged children. The child with DCD will appear to be clumsy and awkward and will
have difficulty in learning and performing new motor tasks. Most of researchers agreed that
motor coordination problems evident in DCD are, in part, the result of perceptual and
cognitive processes, but the limited research available remains inconclusive. In view of the
lack of classification neurological signs or physical impairment, it is important to understand
the nature of motor coordination problems observed in children with DCD.
Smooth and accurate motor functioning is dependent on the ability of a person to both
3Subjects
In this study, five DCD and six typical children aged 7-8 years were recruited into this study
for the validation and reliability test of the experiment apparatuses and the testing protocol. The
DCD children were recruited by a screening of VMI test and confirmed by M-ABC test. The
subjects were excluded from this study if they are reported a history of any medical, neurological,
musculoskeletal, sensory (hearing, vision) or skin disorders.
Experiment Apparatuses for Grip Force Control
A cordless instrumented object will be constructed and used as a manipulandum. The object
and the configuration of the hand and fingers used to grasp it are illustrated on Figure 1. It is
adopted and modified from the work of Nowak et al. (2005). The object is grasped in such a way
that the center of mass and the force sensor are in the axis of grip force. The manipuladum is an
object with a mass of 200, 350, or 500 gm. The object has a height and width of 9.0 cm and a
depth of 4.0 cm. Grip surfaces can be varied according to the aim of the study, e.g., sandpaper,
polysterol plastic, and aluminum. The object incorporates a force sensor for grip force
registration and a 3-D linear acceleration sensor (accelerometer for registration of acceleration
signals in three dimensions). The force sensor registered grip forces are planned to be up to 100 N.
The linear acceleration sensors measured linear acceleration within a range of ± 50 m/s2.
Followed by amplifier, the recorded acceleration and grip force data can be converted into digital
signal and stored within the object. The load forces produced during arm movements can be
calculated from the product of the object mass and the summation of gravity (9.81 m/sec2) and
inertial acceleration. Recorded grip force and acceleration data are Analog-to-Digital converted
with a sampling rate of 100 Hz and stored within the manipulandum by a FLASH data storage.
Data can be transferred to a personal computer for further analysis after each experimental setting
with a single subject.

(A)(C)(E) Performance of a control subject. (B)(D)(F) Performance of a DCD child. Dotted
lines indicate the time points of occurrence of maximal movement. Angle and force scales are
normalized to the maximal and minimum values. Triangle and cross symbols denote the
incorrect timing of maximal grip force.
Fig. 3ACE illustrate that maxima occur almost simultaneously in the typical child,
suggesting that grip force is modulated in parallel with movement induced loads. In Fig. 3BDF
the DCD child's grip force trace is less precisely modulated with the load changes than that
observed for the healthy control. Grip force maxima as denoted by triangle and cross symbols
occur earlier or later than the corresponding load force maxima. The modulation seems less

needed for more insight into the internal models of motor control in children with DCD.
