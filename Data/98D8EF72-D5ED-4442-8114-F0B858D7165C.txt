Abstract 
An empirical mass-flux model was presented to describe the mass-transfer behaviour of toluene vapor 
through polymer gloves. According to the mass-flux model, the mass sorption of solvent vapor in polymer can 
be calculated where the calculated data was found in good agreement with the experimental data from 
sorption measurements. Results demonstrated that the mass-transfer behaviour of toluene vapor through the 
tested polymers was initially dominated by case-II transport in the first 60-65 % of solvent sorption process in 
which an exponential relation was found between solvent sorption rate and inlet surface concentration. The 
mass transfer coefficient of toluene solvent vapor in polymer was a function of inlet surface concentration and 
the breakthrough time decreased linearly with inlet concentration. Moreover, the sorption and desorption 
kinetics of solvent vapor in polymer were also examined. The findings indicated that the mass-transfer 
behaviour in sorption process varied from case-II diffusion to anomalous diffusion, while desorption process 
showed the reverse steps of sorption process and showed three distinct mass-transfer regimes: Fickian 
diffusion, anomalous diffusion and case-II diffusion. Although the initial rate of desorption was significantly 
faster than that of sorption, however, it is worthwhile to note that the rate of long-term desorption was 
extremely low. This reminds people who wear the reusable polymer gloves that they need to confirm if the 
residual solvent has been entirely removed before reusing them. Furthermore, mechanical properties of new 
and artificially aged polymer gloves were investigated by stress-relaxation experiments. The preliminary 
results revealed that mass-transfer behaviour was significantly reflected in the changes of mechanical 
properties of testing materials.

polymer gloves is relatively limited. Meanwhile, as noted, the recommended permeation data for commercial 
chemical-resistant gloves are often focused on the measurement of the ability to resist the penetration of liquid 
solvents rather than that of vapor solvents.  
As above-mentioned information regarding the transport behaviour of organic solvent vapors through 
chemical-resistant gloves and its practical applications on how to assess the obsolescence deadline of used 
gloves in the occupational exposure is lacking, this work was to conduct a series of vapor permeation tests 
with various inlet surface concentrations to investigate the diffusion of organic vapors through 
chemical-resistant gloves. All the test data from permeation tests were dealt with using an empirical 
model-based analysis in which a curve fit equation with a clear physical significance for the fitting parameters 
was employed to correlate the experimental concentration-time data. A corresponding empirical mass-flux 
model was developed by transforming the fitted concentration-time curve, i.e. C-t curve. The diffusion 
behaviour of solvent in polymer can be estimated in terms of mass sorption rate and mass transfer coefficient 
by the empirical mass-flux model. In addition, the mechanical properties of new and artificially aged gloves 
were also measured by stress relaxation test, to elucidate how they related to the observed diffusion behaviour.  
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Permeation test of polymer gloves 
Industrial grade toluene (99.76%) supplied from the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of Taiwan was used 
as the test solvent in this work because toluene is a hazardous air pollutant and one of the most widely used 
organic solvents encountered in the workplace (Samoto et al., 2006). Two common types of solvent-resistant 
gloves, butyl-rubber (North B131/9 Butyl Gloves, USA) and nitrile-rubber gloves (Ansell Edmont Sol-Vex 
Gloves 37-165, England), were chosen for permeation testing. The permeation cell was made of Corning 
Pyrex glass which comprised two chambers: one chamber with the challenge solvent, i.e. challenge chamber, 
and the other for a permeate-solvent collection, i.e. collection chamber. The volumes of challenge chamber 
(Vb) and collection chamber (Vc) are 225 ml and 150 ml, respectively. A patch test material for permeation 
testing cut from the gloves with an effective permeation area of 19.63 cm
2
, corresponding to a radius of 2.5 
cm, was clamped between the two chambers. The average thickness of tested samples was 0.30  0.01 mm in 
butyl rubber and 0.64  0.04 mm in nitrile rubber. To keep stable ambient conditions, all permeation tests 
were conducted in a stainless steel walk-in exposure chamber with room size 3.0 m long  2.5 m wide  2.5 m 
high and computerized monitoring system for logging and controlling environmental parameters such as 
real-time recording for temperature and humidity. Both temperature and relative humidity within the exposure 
chamber were maintained at 25 ± 4 C and 60 ± 20 %, respectively. 
An open-loop ASTM F739 method was employed in this work for measuring the permeation of 
solvent-resistant glove materials. A simplified schematic diagram of the solvent vapor permeation test system 
is given in Fig. 1. During the test period, the basic principle of the permeation cell was that a continuous 
stream of pure nitrogen used as a sample carrier gas from the liquid nitrogen cylinder tank was fed to the 
collection chamber with a fixed volume flowrate (Qc) of 55 ± 1 ml/min and liquid toluene was made up to a 
certain level height (Lh) and maintained the level constant in the challenge chamber by slowly refilling the 
solvent lost through evaporation from the inlet line (fin). The permeation cell was placed in water bath to 
maintain the challenge chamber at a fixed temperature of 25 ± 1 C. In the challenge chamber, liquid solvent 
gradually evaporated through the mechanism of molecular diffusion into the stagnant air at constant

3.1. Curve fitting model to permeation data   
According to Barrer et al. (1962), edge effects in polymer diffusion may be not taken into consideration 
when the thickness-to-radius ratio of test materials is less than 0.2. In this work, the ratios of butyl rubber and 
nitrile rubber were 0.012 and 0.023, respectively. One-dimensional diffusion of organic solvents through a 
polymer membrane can, therefore, be assumed during permeation tests. A comparison of concentration 
profiles with time of the toluene vapor through polymer gloves from FTIR and GC measurements was shown 
in Fig. 2. It can be seen that there was a time delay of approximately 25 ± 5 min of the concentration-time 
profile from FTIR on-line measurements compared to GC real-time measurements. The time delay may be 
due to the dilution effect when carrier gas enters the FTIR absorption cell. At a carrier-gas flow rate of 55 ± 1 
ml/min, the residence time of solvent vapor in the FTIR absorption cell was nearly 30 min. The results 
implied that the delay on-line measurements of FTIR should be shifted to match the real-time analysis of GC 
as shown in Fig. 2 when to determine the breakthrough time (tb) of solvent vapor in polymer gloves using 
FTIR measurements. Fig. 3a shows typical concentration-to-time profiles of butyl-rubber and nitrile-rubber 
polymers under certain permeation test conditions of C0 = 140 mg/l and T = 25 C. A logistic regression 
model in terms of two physical parameters,  and n, proposed by this work was used to fit the measured 
concentration-time data according to the following equation:

where Cg is the concentration of emitted solvent vapor in the collection chamber, Cge is the equilibrium 
concentration of emitted solvent vapor in the collection chamber, t is the sampling time,  is the stochiometric 
time, i.e. sampling time for Cg = 0.5Cge and n is a constant that depends on the characteristic of the diffusion 
behavior of solvent vapor through polymer gloves and the material properties of polymer gloves. Fig. 3a 
shows that the proposed model described adequately for all of the measured concentration-time data. 
Interestingly, the constant n was found to be independent of inlet surface concentration. Within the inlet 
surface concentration range of 42 to 140 mg/l, the mean values of n were -10.43  0.61 and -12.70  0.65 with 
respect to butyl rubber and nitrile rubber. 
   A calculated curve of mass flux to time, i.e. F-t curve, in the collection chamber can be obtained according 
to the mass balance of the emission concentration of solvent vapor around the collection chamber as

Accordingly, as illustrated in Fig. 4, the adsorbed mass before the breakthrough time (tb) and the total amount 
adsorbed when arriving at time in equilibrium (te) were given by the area of diagonal lines and the total areas 
of both diagonal lines and cross diagonal lines, respectively. Figs. 5a and 5b show the profiles of mass 
sorption of toluene solvent vapor with time in butyl-rubber and nitrile-rubber materials, respectively. As noted, 
the calculated results using Eq.(7) were in good agreement with the measured data. Moreover, as illustrated in 
Figs. 5a and 5b, it can be seen during the mass sorption process, i.e. the sampling time interval of t = 0 to t = te, 
that the mass transfer of toluene solvent vapor through the tested polymers was initially dominated by case-II 
diffusion (  1) in the first 60-65 % of mass sorption process, i.e. the sampling time interval of t = 0 to t = tL, 
and after then governed by anomalous diffusion (0.5    1), i.e. the sampling time interval between tL to te, 
when describing the mass sorption of toluene solvent vapor in polymer according to the semi-empirical 
formula, Eq.(6). It is believed that case-II transport mainly takes place in glassy polymers because of the 
internal stress caused by a material deformation due to the matrix swelling in polymers (Masaro and Zhu, 
1999). The glass transition temperature may also decrease with the increase of solvent concentration in 
polymers (Samus and Rossi, 1996). Obviously, the results implied that a glass transition of the polymer is 
induced by a gradual increase of solvent concentration in the polymer, where the structure of tested polymers 
goes from a glassy state to a rubbery phase.  
To validate the empirical mass-flux model, a comparison between sorption measurements and calculated 
results using Eq. (7) was made under different inlet concentrations as shown in Fig. 6. The good agreement 
indicated that this proposed model can provide an alternative approach to measuring the solvent uptake in 
polymers without the need for conducting a tedious and time consuming laboratory work, such as sorption 
measurements and immersion tests. Figs. 7a/7b show that mass sorption rate of case-II diffusion (qm-caseII) and 
breakthrough time (tb) were inlet surface concentration (C0) dependant. Within the inlet surface concentration 
range tested in this work, qm-caseII increased exponentially with inlet concentration, while tb decreased linearly 
with inlet concentration. The increase of qm-caseII may be a consequence of higher swelling stress in polymer 
matrix due to a more strength interaction between polymer and with an increase solvent concentration, 
resulting in a slow response of internal stress relaxation in polymer and leading to a higher accommodation 
for the solvent in the polymer matrix, which in turn speed up the mass sorption rate.  
Generally, mass transfer of solvent vapor across a thin membrane at equilibrium can be described in terms 
of a flux equation as (Cussler, 1997)  
)Ck(CF SE0SE                                                     (9) 
where FSE and CSE are the steady-state mass flux and concentration of solvent vapor at the outlet surface of 
tested polymer, respectively, and k represents the mass transfer coefficient. As shown in Fig. 8, it is interested 
to find that there was a linear relationship between the mass transfer coefficient and the mass sorption rate of 
case-II diffusion, implying that the estimated mass transfer coefficient was also a function of inlet 
concentration. Moreover, an understanding of the desorption behaviour of solvent from the polymer matrix is 
essential to help ensure a safe application for the reusable polymer gloves. In this work, desorption process 
was performed by the same method of permeation tests described above in which the liquid solvent in 
challenge chamber was removed when reaching a steady-state permeation. Interestingly, a good fit for the 
measured concentration-time data of desorption process can also be founded using the same proposed 
 10 
difference between new and aged nitrile-rubber materials. Apparently, butyl rubber has a better anti-aging 
function than nitrile rubber. As illustrated in Fig. 10b, it is interested to find out that the corresponding 
flux-time profiles between new and artificially aged gloves for both applied polymers were also showing 
similar trends as observed in the mechanical properties. The F-t curves of new and aged butyl-rubber 
polymers were only a slight variation, whereas the F-t curves of new and aged nitrile-rubber polymers showed 
a dramatic change. Furthermore, due to the coupling effects of chain scission and crosslinking during the 
accelerated aging process (Lucas et al., 2002), the outside surface of nitrile-rubber glove appeared to be more 
rigid and have some microcracks (photo not shown), which may lead to channeling and early breakthrough 
time as shown in Fig. 10b. Meanwhile, the decline in permeation flux of aged nitrile rubber may be partly 
attributed to the clogging in the polymer surface caused by the cross-linking effect. Fig. 11 shows a 
comparison of the kinetics of solvent uptake between new and aged nitrile-rubber polymers. The results 
indicated that the behaviour of mass transfer was changed from case-II diffusion to anomalous diffusion, 
which may be explained because the polymer relaxation process of aged nitrile rubber was faster than that of 
new nitrile rubber (Fig. 10a), probably implying that the rates of diffusion and polymer relaxation were 
comparable in the aged nitrile rubber (Masaro and Zhu, 1999). Combined together, it can be concluded that 
the variations of solvent permeation through polymer materials are indeed associated with the age-dependent 
changes in mechanical properties of polymer materials. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Understanding the mass-transfer behaviour of solvent vapor through polymer gloves is important for 
people who have to wear polymer gloves to prevent solvent vapors. However, the investigations of organic 
solvent vapor through the polymer gloves are rather limited as compared to the mass-transfer studies of liquid 
solvent in polymer gloves. In this paper, a logistic regression equation with two physical parameters was 
proposed to fit the measured concentration-time data. According to the regression C-t curve, an empirical 
mass-flux model was developed to elucidate the mass-transfer characteristics of toluene vapor through 
polymer gloves and, in turn, the kinetics of solvent sorption/desorption of solvent vapor in polymer was also 
investigated using the mass-flux model. Within the working inlet surface concentration range in this study, the 
solvent sorption rate increased exponentially with the inlet surface concentration, the mass transfer coefficient 
increased linearly with the solvent sorption rate, and the breakthrough time decreased linearly with inlet 
surface concentration. Results demonstrated that the calculated data of mass sorption from the mass-flux 
model was found in good agreement with the experimental data from sorption measurements. This suggested 
that the proposed mass-flux model can serve as a useful tool to investigate the kinetics of mass sorption 
instead of the time-consuming immersion tests.  
During the solvent sorption process, the mass-transfer characters of toluene vapor through the 
butyl-rubber and nitrile-rubber polymers appeared to be initially governed by case-II diffusion in the first 
60-65 % of sorption process and subsequently followed by anomalous diffusion. In contrast to sorption 
process, desorption process showed the reverse steps of sorption process but associated with three distinct 
mass-transfer features: Fickian diffusion, anomalous diffusion and case-II diffusion. As noted, the initial rate 
of desorption process was higher than that of sorption process, while the rate of long-term desorption was 
extremely low. Experimental data showed that the desorbed solvent in polymer gloves was still detectable 
even after 12 hr, suggesting that after each use the thermal desorption should be considered to volatilize
