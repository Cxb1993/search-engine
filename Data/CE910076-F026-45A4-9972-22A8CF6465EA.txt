1.  Introduction 
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are considered to have potential for 
commercialization thanks to their high energy conversion efficiency, self-reforming 
ability, compatibility with common hydrocarbon fuels, use of solid state materials, 
and no need of noble metals as catalysts [1]. SOFCs can be used in large-size 
stationary power facilities or applied to heat and power generation for home and 
factory as well as auxiliary power units for electrical systems in transportation 
vehicles. In recent years, enormous research efforts have been invested on the 
development of intermediate temperature SOFCs (IT-SOFCs) capable of operating 
at temperatures between 500 and 700C [2,3]. However, the performance of 
IT-SOFCs depends strongly on the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and the 
polarization resistance (Rp) of the electrodes [4]. The former problem can be solved 
by using alternative electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity at low temperatures, 
such as La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3- (LSGM) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O2- (SDC) or by using a 
thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte film [5].  
Several film-deposition approaches have been used to reduce the thickness of 
electrolyte layers. These approaches can be divided into the following three categories: 
(a). Physical methods including sputtering [6], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [7]; (b). 
Chemical processes including sol-gel [8], spray pyrolysis [9], atomic layer deposition 
(ALD) [10], electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD) [11], metalorganic chemical 
vapor deposition (MOCVD) [12], flame assisted vapor deposition [13], electrostatic 
assisted vapor deposition [14]; and (c). Ceramic powder processes including screen 
printing [15], tape casting [16], suspension spray coating [17], slurry spin-coating [18], 
inject printing [19], electrophoretic deposition [20], and dry pressing [21]. However, 
these processes are often marked with restrictions rendering large-scale SOFC 
manufacturing highly challenging, such as a high substrate temperature (typically 
  - 6 -
composites with ratios of 60 wt%/40 wt% and 50 wt%/50 wt% respectively. The thin 
50 wt% NiO/50 wt% SDC composite layer provided a good contact with the adjacent 
electrolyte layer. The preparation of the anode-supported substrates was described in a 
previous paper [23]. 
To prepared YSZ and BNO targets, Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 and 0.79Bi2O3-0.21Nb2O5 
powders were mixed in the methyl alcohol using polyethylene jars and ZrO2 media.  
After drying, the powders were added with 3.5 wt% of a 15% PVA solution and then 
pelletized into disc shape at a uniaxial pressure of 2 tons/cm2.  The YSZ and BNO 
targets were then heat treated at 550C for 6 h to eliminate the PVA, followed by 
sintering at 1400C and 900C for 2 h, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens 
D5000), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JOEL JSM-T330A), and energy 
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) on the sintered target surfaces were used to confirm 
the formation of phases and characterize the microstructures. 
YSZ and BNO thin films were deposited on the anode substrates in sequence by 
RF magnetron sputtering using YSZ and BNO targets. Deposition of thin films was 
done in a sputtering system equipped with a turbomolecular pump to achieve a base 
pressure of <2x10-7 torr. For sputtering, argon as the working gas was at least 
99.995% pure.  Prior to deposition, the target was sputter-cleaned. Working pressure 
was in the range of 1x10-2 torr while RF power was 100 W. YSZ films were first 
deposited on the anode-supported substrates in an atmosphere of Ar and O2 mixture 
with ratio of 30:1 and a bias of 45 V. During deposition, the substrate temperature was 
controlled at 300C. BNO films were subsequently deposited on the top of the YSZ 
films in an atmosphere of Ar and O2 mixture with various ratios and with the substrate 
temperature ranging from room temperature to 300C. Film samples were heat treated 
at 650C in O2 atmosphere in a RTA furnace (MILA-3000) at a heating rate of 
1C/sec. XRD analysis was then performed, using a thin film diffractometer with 
  - 8 -
compared with that of the BNO target. It indicated that only Bi3NbO7 phase existed in 
the target (Figure 2a). The diffraction peaks of the XRD patterns of the as-deposited 
films are indexed to the cubic Fm 3 m structure of Bi3NbO7 (JCPDS Card No. 
86-0875, a=0.5479 nm), which appears to be pretty similar to that of the target. It is 
consistent with that shown in the phase diagram [24]. 20 to 23 m% of Nb2O5 in the 
Bi2O3-Nb2O5, leads to the formation of Bi3NbO7 phase, a fcc phase similar to the 
high-temperature fcc -Bi2O3 phase. Bi3NbO7 is believed to exhibit a Type-II 
structure, which is an incommensurate modulation of the -Bi2O3 fluorite structure 
[25]. For the BNO films deposited at various atmospheres (Figure 2b), the XRD 
patterns seem very similar, though the Bi and Nb contents of the BNO films vary with 
the sputtering atmosphere. 
Figure 3 shows the surface SEM micrographs of the BNO films deposited at the 
substrate temperatures of 25C and 300C in the as-deposited form as well as the 
micrographs of the films annealed at 700C for 2 h, and Figure 4 indicates the 
corresponding cross-section SEM micrographs. The annealing temperature of 700C 
was selected to examine the film deposition conditions and the film quality because 
the final cells with silver cathode was post-fired at 650C and operated at the 
temperature range of 500 to 700C. As shown in Figures 3(a) and 4(a), a uniform and 
dense BNO film approximately 7 m in thickness was obtained under the sputtering 
conditions of O2 flow rate of 7 sccm and Ar flow rate of 31 sccm on the un-heated 
substrate. After annealing at 700C, mud cracks were observed on the surface of the 
film [Figure 3(b)], and the cracks occurred across the whole BNO layer until reaching 
the BNO-anode interface [Figure 4(b)]. Apparently, the cracks were induced by the 
difference in the thermal expansions of the BNO film and the anode substrate. The 
BNO film deposited at 300C is characterized by a greater surface roughness and a 
higher porosity, as indicated in Figure 3(c). After subsequent annealing at 700C, it

lower than the expected theoretical value. Possible reasons for the deviation might 
include the gas leakage due to the pinholes formed in the bi-layer electrolytes and the 
partial electronic conductivity resulting in a short-circuited condition of the cell. The 
physical gas leakage can be excluded as a cause of decreased OCV, since the film is 
relatively dense based on the SEM observation. Although it is known in the literature 
that the electronic conductivity in bulk YSZ and BNO is negligibly small, it becomes 
significant with decreasing thickness due to an increased oxygen gradient [26,27]. At 
present, this seems to be the most reasonable explanation for the lower OCV. 
 
4. Summary 
YSZ-BNO bi-layer electrolyte films on NiO-SDC anode substrates were prepared 
by RF magnetron sputtering. The BNO film deposited in a mixture of 31 sccm Ar and 
7 sccm O2 appeared to be the closest to the target composition. The XRD patterns of 
the film are indexed to the cubic Fm 3 m structure of Bi3NbO7, which seems very 
similar to that of the target. The as-deposited film was well-crystalline and consisted 
of fine grains and random orientation microstructure. The single cell prepared consists 
of a bi-layer electrolyte of approximately 4.0 m YSZ and 1.5 m BNO layers, a 
NiO-SDC anode and an Ag cathode. The open circuit voltage (OCV) and the 
maximum power density (MPD) read 0.94 V and 10 mW/cm2 at 600C respectively. 
The electronic conductivity associated with the thin electrolyte seems to be the most 
reasonable explanation for the lower OCV.
