decision making (MCDM) technologies and game theorem, we are able to achieve ABNC elegantly with
some IMS signaling extension.
When multi-mode MTs communicate, they can exploit the concurrent transmission paths existed between
them for improving transmission throughput. In this research, we investigate a cross layer model between
application layer, transport layer and MAC layer to optimize end-to-end throughput while achieving a stable

4.2. 跨通訊層平行傳輸路徑選擇與TCP傳輸效能控制演算法
4.2.1. 交易理論賽局
不同的 TCP Path在相同的網路介面上(MAC)都想進行資源保留，然而資源保留必須是一個公平的
機制。為了解決多路徑平行傳輸的問題，本研究使用交易理論的賽局(bargaining game theory)，設計一
個多路徑平行傳輸的控制方法，將資源保留問題做以下描述：
 玩家(Player)：每一個 Path是一個賽局中的玩家，Path由  DSPi  表示，S為資料來源端，
S為資料接收端。
 策略(strategy)：一個玩家 i的策略是指可以建立多少個 TCP連線( in )。
 報酬(payoff)：一個玩家 i的報酬(total utility iU )是由數個 TCP連線 in 所合併計算的總傳輸量
(Throughput)。同時間，報酬必須考慮到維持這些 TCP連線的代價。
根據交易理論的賽局，多路徑上的資源保留應表示為：

當所有的玩家都同意交易時，玩家 i的報酬將為 iU ，表示可以增加 TCP連線；否則玩家 i的報酬需回
到 0iU 基礎點，即不可變動連線狀況。
為了避免無限制的增加 TCP連線，統計報酬時必須考慮維護 TCP連線的代價。因此，對於玩家 i
的報酬 iU 定義為:

在時間 t，玩家 i維持一條 TCP連線的傳輸量為滑動視窗大小(windows size)除以同一個封包來回時間
(round-trip time)；且參數則是指維持一條 TCP連線所需要花費的代價。
在評估 0iU 基礎點時，也必須考慮其他玩家的 TCP連線的影響，因此，對於

6最後，如何評估分析  iopt WE 才能計算出穩定的最佳連線數 optin 是一個關鍵性的挑戰。因此，本研究提
出幾個方法來計算  iopt WE 值：
 以測量為基礎的每條連線(Measurement-based as per connection，簡稱MPC)
此方法假設  iopt WE 為過去一段時間內，週期性的測量每條連線的平均壅塞滑動視窗大小，並表示
為:
  iiopt WWE  (10)
然而，測量的週期時間是個取捨平衡(trade-off)的問題。當週期時間過大，平均滑動視窗大小的測
量較為不敏銳(sensitive)(例:圖3顯示為46秒內平均滑動視窗大小的波動)。相對地，較小的週期時間亦會
造成平均滑動視窗大小有較大的波動而導致  iopt WE 預測較為不穩定。
圖3 在一個短週期時間(e.g. 15s)內，測量平均滑動視窗大小的波動狀態
 以測量為基礎並視為單一連線(Measurement-based as a single connection，簡稱MSC)
假設TCP連線的滑動視窗大小可遞增至一個極限值並將封包資料充滿整個路徑通道。因為TCP連線
需要花費一段時間才能將滑動視窗大小遞增至瓶頸頻寬(bandwidth-delay product)，所以此方法將多條
TCP連線的滑動視窗大小聚集起來並視為單一個較大流量的TCP連線。在滑動視窗大小達到瓶頸頻寬
前，滑動視窗大小的期望值可透過下述表示的公式評估:
ii Wn  (11)
假設當路徑 i的最佳連線數 optin 已經被建立且傳輸的總頻寬可達到瓶頸頻寬大小，表示式假設如下:
  ioptiiopt WnWE  (12)
根據公式(9)與(12)聯立得之:

公式(13)說明給定一個  iopt WE 時，較低滑動視窗大小 iW 會產生較高的連線數 optin 。因此，良好的樣品
值 iW 對於建立合適的TCP連線是必要的條件。但此研究尚未能判斷目前測量的 iW 是否正確，因此，要
評估較佳的連線數 optin 是很難達成的。
 以關聯為基礎並視為單一連線(Correlation-based as a single connection，簡稱CSC)
為了避免上述方法的問題，CSC方法考慮瓶頸頻寬與其他路徑的影響來評估 iW 。當給定一個在過

Abstract— In the Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET),
vehicles are clustered to construct many small networks
(clusters) so that channel interferences and flooding mes-
sages can be limited. This work presents a novel Multi-
resolution Relative Speed Detection (MRSD) model to im-
prove the clustering algorithm in VANET without using a
Global Positioning System (GPS). MRSD uses the Moving
Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the Momentum
of Received Signal Strength (MRSS) and an Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) to estimate the motion state and the relative
speed of a vehicle based purely on Received Signal Strength
(RSS). With the speed information, vehicles in a cluster are
grouped by their speeds and a vehicle in the largest group
is elected as a cluster leader. Moreover, MRSD can detect
relative speed among vehicles without GPS and thus can
offer better privacy for users. Simulation results show that
MRSD can classify accurately vehicles speed without GPS
assistance.

detection, relative speed estimation, VANET
1. Introduction
With the explosive growth of Intelligent Transport Sys-
tems (ITS) and networks, Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork
(VANET) becomes an emerging new type of ad hoc wire-
less networks with high speed mobility, which envisions
inter/intra vehicle communications. These communications
could be categorized into Vehicle to Roadside units (V2R)
and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication. Because both
V2R and V2V could be required to transfer data (e.g., safety
message, video data), the future wireless technologies are
expected to provide a reliable and high speed transmission
rate over highly mobile networks.
One of the effective schemes in boosting communication
performance in VANET is by clustering vehicles into groups
so as to reduce interference among vehicles’ communication.
However, clustering in VANET becomes very challenging
because of the speeds of vehicles and rapid topology change,
even though the movement of vehicles is somewhat pre-
dictable. S. Biswas et al. [1] indicate that the message
path in VANET can typically survive only 1 minute while
maintaining a transmission range of 500 meters. So VANET
may suffer frequent partition and merging resulting in great
overheads for new topology information exchange and ve-
hicles reconfiguration. Therefore, how to cluster vehicles
efficiently is current a very important issue in VANET.
In the past, many clustering algorithms have been pro-
posed for mobile ad hoc wireless networks (MANETs)
[2]. However, their topology management approaches are
not designed for high speed vehicular environment [3].
Thus, their schemes could produce substantial overhead
when clusters partition and merge frequently. To reduce
the overhead, some researchers utilized Global Positioning
System (GPS) devices to identify locations of vehicles and
perform position-based clustering [4]. However, GPS has
some drawbacks. First, if regular GPS technique is used
without any specialized equipment, it can have a low level
accuracy. Secondly, GPS does not work in locations where
no line of sight exists, e.g., in a tunnel or in a cloudy
day. Finally, the personal security and privacy should be
considered inclusively. Because the exchanged information
between vehicles is the realistic position data, people with
intensions can track the others’ behavior easily and freely.
Thus, an efficient clustering scheme without GPS devices
for VANET is desirable and can serve to supplement GPS-
based approaches in the situations where GPS approaches
fail.
This work presents a novel Multi-resolution Relative
Speed Detection (MRSD) model to obtain the relative speed
information and the motion states of vehicles for aggregating
vehicles over VANET. MRSD is constructed with the Multi-
Resolution Analysis (MRA) model and the Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) model. The novelty of MRSD is in its
ability to learn a vehicle’s speed and relative motion among
vehicles based on the measured Received Signal Strength
(RSS) samples received from a Road Side Unit (RSU).
MRSD transforms the RSS samples into useful input values
for motion detection and speed classification by applying
various signal analysis schemes, such as the Moving Aver-
age Convergence Divergence (MACD) method [5] and the
Momentum of Received Signal Strength (MRSS) method
[6]. Then, MRSD uses an ANN to learn the relative speed
of a vehicle and perform speed classification. With MRSD,
a vehicle can learn its relative speed and classify its speed
when it bypasses a RSU without using a GPS.

munication and cluster management. When clusters cannot
communicate directly through a wireless link, they must
communicate through Internet, in which agents are created
as their representation in inter-cluster communication.
Clusters can be merged and split dynamically. Two clus-
ters are merged when vehicles in each cluster are moving
close within a V2V communication range. A cluster is
partitioned when vehicles in the cluster lose connectivity.
When clusters are merged or partitioned, new cluster heads
are elected to manage the clusters. Fig. 3 shows an example
of the cluster-based VANETs.
3.2 Multi-resolution Relative Speed Detection
The proposed Multi-resolution Relative Speed Detection
(MRSD) algorithm can detect the relative motion and relative
speed for V2V and V2R communication. The MRSD model
is composed of two signal analysis sensor and an ANN to
perform vehicle speed classification and motion detection.
In the following sub-sections, we review two signal analysis
sensors, MACD and MRSS, and introduce the MRSD model.
3.2.1 MRSS and MACD Model
In our priori work [6], we proposed the MRSS model to
identify the user motion state by calculating the difference
value between two consecutive smoothed RSS samples as
shown in Fig. 4. The user motion states are classified as
approaching state, leaving state, and stationary state. The

motion detection results are used to improve the performance
of handoff algorithm.
The computation process of MRSS can be divided into
three steps. First, an Averaged RSS (ARSS) is computed
over T RSS samples as expressed in Eq. 1. Then, an
Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) filter (Eq.
2) is used to smooth ARSS’es. Finally, the MRSS is defined
as the difference between EWMAi and EWMAj , where
i > j ≥ 0, as shown in Eq. 3.

the relative motion between the mobile node and the AP
considered. It evaluates the considered moving state of a
mobile node by using various MACD and MRSS filters.
These indicators have different sensitivities in detecting
motion and hence can allow us to accurately estimate the
state of motion. The MRSS filter is a high pass filter that
takes many consecutive outputs of an EWMA filter as inputs
and output their difference. The MACD filter produces a
trend indicator by calculating the difference (DIF) between
the outputs of two EWMA filters with different smoothing
factors. Based on the configuration of MRSS and MACD,
we can readily see that the number of MRSS filters is equal
to the number of EWMA filters while the number of MACD
filters can be readily calculated as follows.
Numberdifferentscale
= (Numberinputlayer)× (Numberinputlayer − 1)/2,
where Numberinputlayer denotes the number of EWMA
filters in the Input Unit Layer. Thus, if Numberinputlayer
equal to 9, the total numbers of MACD filters is 36.
In the ANN model, the two-layer hidden units take outputs
from all MRSS and MACD filter, which have 7 and 10
neurons separately. To include the concept of speed, MRSD
maps various speeds ranging between 60—160 (km/h) refer-
ring to highway speeds as shown in Table 2. Fig. 6 illustrates
a MRSD model that can classify vehicle speed into four
classes, very high speed, high speed, medium speed and low
speed, in the Summary Units Layer. The user motion states
also are identified as approaching state and leaving state. In
Fig. 6, both of the approaching node and the leaving node
calculate the strength degree according to the results from
the Hidden Unit Layer.
Finally, the Output Unit Layer computes the motion state
result from the leaving node and the approaching node and
the speed level result from four speed class nodes in the
Summary Unit Layer. Through offline training, MRSD can
classify the speed of vehicles into a speed level based on
RSS samples. Thus, the output can be used as the basis of
constructing a cluster over VANET.
3.3 Clustering Methodology Based on MRSD
Mobile nodes in VANET can transfer data with each other
or connect to AP of the roadside. Generally, the mobile
nodes are constructed into a cluster to improve the transfer
rate among vehicles. Instead of using GPS devices to detect
the position of a mobile node, we present a clustering
algorithm that uses the MRSD model to aggregate a cluster
in an efficient way. The simulation of the clustering scheme
is, however, out of the scope of this paper and to be presented
in the next coming paper.
The main idea of our clustering scheme is to choose a
node in the biggest group of a speed level while near the

5. Conclusions and Future Works
This paper proposed a model called Multi-resolution Rela-
tive Speed Detection (MRSD) to perform speed classification
and motion detection without GPS. It combines MACD
and MRSS features and an artificial neural network for
velocity classification. MRSD can classify velocity into four
speed levels and two moving state (approaching or leaving.
The simulation result illustrates that MRSD is reasonable
accurate in speed classification and detection. Based on the
information gained from MRSD, we can improve the cluster
aggregation with speed classification even when GPS is not
available.

2.1 Backoff Scheme Approach  
 This section investigates various backoff schemes in 
802.11. These schemes can be divided into two classes: non-
measurement based and measurement based. The first class 
called non-measurement based schemes. It modifies the 
baseline BEB scheme: the contention window decreased after 
a successful transmission, while the contention window 
increased when a collision happens. The LILD (Linear 
Increase Linear Decrease) [14], DIDD (Double Increase 
Double Decrease) [15], MILD (Multiplicative Increase and 
Linear Decrease) [16], FCR (Fast Collision Resolution) [17], 
GDCF (Gentle DCF) [18] and ELBA (Exponential-Linear 
Backoff Algorithm) [19] belong to this category. Their 
designed for distributed wireless networks to reducing 
collisions and access delay so that the throughput is improved. 
The second-class called measurement based schemes. It 
continuously observes the busy degree of medium of a 
WLAN and dynamically adjusts contention window size to 
reflect the channel state in the WLAN. [6] [21] [22] [23] and 
[24] belong to this category. 
2.2 Non-Measurement Based Scheme 
 The non-measurement-based approaches can be 
classified into two categories: basic type and adaptive type. 
2.2.1 Basic Type 
This approach is a modified version of BEB. It sets 
different update rules to optimize contention window size. 
The Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) is widely used 
in the backoff scheme of 802.11 DCF. In BEB scheme, the 
backoff time interval is selected uniformly between 0 and the 
Contention Window (CW) initially. Each node doubles its 
contention window (CW) up to its maximum contention 
window (CWmax) after experiencing a collision and resets its 
CW to the minimum value (CWmin) after a successful 
transmission. It can be formally defined as follow. 
max
min
min( , 2),
,
CW CW on collision or failure
CW
CW on successful transmission
×⎧= ⎨⎩
 
The disadvantages of BEB is in its short-term unfairness 
and bad performance in congestion. In the past, several 
modifications have been proposed to improve the 
performance of the BEB algorithm. 
The Linear-Increase Linear-Decrease (LILD) 
mechanism always adjusts the contention window by a 
constant. It can be defined formally as follows, where θ 
represents a tunable parameter.

min
min( , ),
max( , ),

+⎧= ⎨ −⎩
 
 
Furthermore, due to this behavior, the CW is adjusted 
very slowly when the loading change rapidly from heavy to 
light. Therefore, it is not suitable for mobility network where 
mobile nodes move.  
The main idea of the DIDD algorithm is to reduce CWs 
gently and gradually after a successful transmission. More 
specifically, the DIDD mechanism decreases the size of 
contention window by half after a successful transmission. It 
can be defined formally as follow : 
 
max
min
min( , 2),
max( , / 2),
CW CW on collision or failure
CW
CW CW on successful Transmission
×⎧= ⎨⎩
 
 
The advantage of DIDD is keeping CW value large 
enough during a congestion period in order to avoid more 
collisions after a successful transmission; however, it has the 
problems of slow convergence at light load.  
The Multiplicative Increase and Linear Decrease (MILD) 
algorithm first introduced in the MACAW [14]. In the MILD 
scheme, when a packet successful transmission, contention 
window is decreased by 1 until it reaches to the CWmin; when 
a packet collides, contention window is increased by a 
multiplicative factor (1.5) until the CW reaches CWmax. It can 
be defined formally as follows,  
 
max
min
min( , 1.5),
,
max( , 1),
packet
CW CW on collision or failure
CW CW on overhearing successful transmission
CW CW on successful Transmission
⎧ ×⎪= ⎨⎪ −⎩
 
 
where CWpacket is the CW value included in the overheard 
successful packet.The great feature of this approach is to 
introduce the concept of duplication: all nodes using the same 
CW by overhearing in neighborhood of the successful 
transmission. Therefore, MILD can provide better fairness 
than the BEB, but it also increases the probability of collision.  
FCR (Fast Collision Resolution) uses a very smaller 
initial contention window size CWmin (3) to reduce the wasted 
idle backoff slots, and uses a much larger maximum 
contention window size CWmax (2047) in order to decrease 
quickly the probability of collisions. FCR doubles the 
contention window size when it is in either a collision state or 
a deferring state, and resets contention window size to CWmin 
at the successful transmission. It can be formally defined as 
follows. 
 
max
min
min( , 2),
,
CW CW on collision or failure or deferring state
CW
CW on successful transmission
×⎧= ⎨⎩
 
 
FCR solves collision much more effective, and thus 
providing a better performance than BEB. The disadvantage 
of FCR is unfair.  
3.1.1 Assumptions 
We consider the network environment as follows: 
1. n finite stations compete the same channel in an ad-hoc 
wireless network. 
2. All stations use the same medium access mechanism in 
ideal channel conditions (no bit errors or hidden node 
issue). 
3. All stations use the same physical layer. 
4. All stations use the same rate speed and packet length. 
5. All stations use basic access mode (without RTS/CTS). 
6. All stations are under saturated conditions. 
7. All stations are within coverage range (in same collision 
domain). 
3.1.2 Maximum Saturation Throughput 
Let saturation throughput S defined as:

E T
=                                       (3-1) 
 
where E[P] is the average length of the successfully 
transmitted payload, and E[T] is the average value of the 
duration of the following channel states: 
Ti – idle slot duration, 
Ts – the duration required for a successful frame 
transmission, 
Tc – the duration required when a transmission is with a 
collision, 
with the basic access mechanism. These time durations 
depend on:

          (3-2) 
 
where, Theader and Tack are the overhead to transmit a packet, σ 
is the duration of an empty time slot, Rtr is the packet 
transmission rate, Rbasic is the transmission rate of control 
packets, l is the size of payload, MAChdr and PHYhdr are the 
headers as defined in the 802.11 standard, lack is size of an 
ACK frame and δ is the propagation delay.  
Consider an arbitrary time slot. Let trP  be the probability 
of at least one transmission in the time slot andτ be the 
probability that each station transmits. Then, the probabilities 
of each channel state can be defined as follows: 
1

where iP  is the probability of idle in a slot, sP is the 
probability of successful transmission in a slot and Pc is the 
probability of collision in a slot. trP is the probability that 
there is at least one transmission in a given slot time. Thus, 
the saturation throughput S can be computed as:

⋅= ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅                                  (3-4)

In order to maximize saturation throughput, ( )F τ must 
be minimal. So let ' ( ) 0F τ = , we can get the maximum 
saturation throughput when τ is optimal τ opt. The related 
equations can be express as follow: 
 
1
/ 2opt cn T
τ ≈ ⋅
                                          (3-6) 
 
In [2], τ also can be expressed as, 2
1W
τ = +
. So we can 
also get the optimum contention window
optCW  by 
 
2opt cCW n T≈ ⋅                                           (3-7) 
 
Finally, let the transmission rate be 11Mbps in DSSS, 
and the payload length is equal to 1024 bytes. Then, the 
approximate value of Tc is about 62.2 (slot time). If we 
substitute it to Eq. (3-7), the maximum saturation throughput 
can be easily calculated. 
3.2 Maximum Saturation Throughput 
Previous studies show that the non-measurement-based 
methods mostly employed a fixed initial CW, which seems to 
be simple and effective but have the drawback of slow 
convergence and poor adaptability. On the other hand, the 
measurement-based methods frequently carry out large 
measurements and calculations, which cause heavy system 
overhead and degeneration in performance. Thus, a novel 
approach is needed to enhance the backoff algorithm. An 
simulation. Section 4.2 compares the saturation throughput vs. 
number of nodes for various backoff algorithms. 
4.1 Simulation Environment and Parameters 
In order to evaluate performance of the proposed DABA 
scheme, we use the OPNET network simulator to perform 
simulations and generic topologies as shown in Figure 2. In 
simulations, we ran three times for each case under different 
random seeds and created an ad-hoc network with randomly 
generated traffic. Also all simulated MANETs are within a 
500m×500m area, and the number of active nodes vary from 
ten to seventy.

All simulations were performed under saturated 
condition. We assume that all stations are within the 
transmission range and use a fixed packet size: 1024 bytes, 
and the simulation time is 60 seconds. Table 3 and Table 4 
show the simulation parameters and system parameters in the 
simulation. 
Then, we study the performance improvement of DABA 
over the BEB, DIDD and LILD schemes in saturation 
throughput, retransmission attempts, medium access delay 
and fairness. 
4.2 Comparisons of Saturation Throughput 
This section analyzed the simulation results. For first, we 
validate the correctness of adopted model under saturated 
conditions. In this simulated conditions, we study the impact 
of saturation throughput on various contention window sizes 
and node numbers. Figure 3 shows the saturation throughput 
performance obtained from the model with various contention 
window sizes under different numbers of stations. As we 
expected, under a saturated condition, the optimal contention 
window size increases when the number of stations increases 
when a fixed packet length and transmission rate are used. 
The results confirmed that our calculated CWopt could 
achieve maximum saturation throughput under various 
network scales. From the observation of Fig. 4, all of the 
results point out the proposed DABA scheme can achieve 
throughput higher than legacy backoff schemes in various 
network scales.

去解決一個無線網路的吞吐量最大化和維護成本最小化的問題，創造一個能夠達
成高穩定和高效率的TCP傳輸機制—MPTC。為了獲得穩定的TCP連線數，每條路徑

(英文) Multiple Path TCP Connection (MPTC) game with a Nash Bargaining Game 
framework is proposed to solve the problem that maximizes transport throughput while 
minimizing its maintenance cost. To obtain the stable number of TCP connections, each 
path (a player of MPTC) estimates its optimal connection number based on an extended 
fluid model over a virtual path router and correlates them among communication paths. 
Then, the paths negotiate cooperatively with each other to adjust the number of TCP 
connections. Simulation results show that MPTC can maintain a stable and a low 
number of TCP connections, while achieving close to optimal transport throughput as 
compared to existing approaches.
