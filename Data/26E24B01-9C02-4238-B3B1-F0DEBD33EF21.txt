ABSTRACT 
This summary report is based on the three annual reports that are under the same tile of 
“Chelating Type Block Copolymers and their Applications in Metal Nanomaterials and Catalysts 
of fuel cell”. In first year, alkylated polyethylenimines were used to prepare shape-controlled 
metal nanoparticles and were characterized their behaviors in water. The results showed that 
ring-like gold nanoparticles and gold nanoplates can be prepared under different conditions. In 
second year, the metal nanoparticles prepared by chemical reduction of metal ion with NaBH4 
were loaded on carbon as catalysts for DMFC. It was found the increasing Au content in 
PtxAuy/C can decrease the activity to cross-over methanol, however, the increasing Au content in 
catalysts also decrease the ORR activity. There are two parts for the last year; First part is to 
finish the research about metal nanoparticles reversible assemble, and the second part is to 
develop a SMA-based polymer bearing sulfonic acid group for the application in catalyst layer 
for DMFC.

Methods 
Synthesis and characterization 
The alkyl-grafted PEIs (Scheme 1) have been synthesized via a simple one-step addition reaction 
of the alkyl group (1,2-epoxydodecane) grafted onto one or two terminals of the commercial 
linear PEI. The stoichiometric amount of 1,2-epoxydodecane was charged into a 250-mL flask 
with linear PEI and 120 mL chloroform under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then heated 
and stirred at 65 °C for 12 h. After the solvent was removed under a reduced pressure, the viscous 
solution was poured into hexane to precipitate the polymer. Finally, the product was dried at 60 
°C for 48 h in a vacuum oven. The completion of the reaction was monitored by observing the 
disappearance of the characteristic epoxide absorption peak at 915 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectrum. 
The total amine values of the polymers PEI, PEI-1R and PEI-2R were determined by 
potentiometric titration method to be 2.14×10-2, 1.64×10-2 and 9.40×10-3 mol/g, respectively.

Results and discussion 
???(???Langmuir 2007, 23, 6801-6806)? 
Mono- and di-alkylated polyethylenimines (PEI-1R, PEI-2R) were used for the facile synthesis of 
gold nanoplate with a preferential growth direction along the Au (111) plane in the aqueous 
solution. The alkylated polymers carries amino groups capable of coordinating with Au(III) ions 
whereas the alkyl segments do not react with Au(III) ions and mainly promote polymer 
aggregates in water. After mixing HAuCl4 with PEI samples, the solution was allowed to stand at 
room temperature for 5 days and the formation of gold particles was manifested by a gradual 
red-violet or gold-yellow coloration of the solution. It is worth noting that, in the synthesis, gold 
particles were prepared without adding extra reductants. Reduction of gold ions was carried out 
by amino groups of PEI. It was reported the amino groups can be oxidized in the aqueous phase 
as alkylamine complexes with metal ions [25-26], indicating that the amino groups of PEI play a 
similar role in the reduction of gold ions in the present case. 
Representative TEM images of PEI samples with the N/Au ratio of 5 (pH 3.6) are shown in 
Figure 1. For alkylated PEIs, gold nanoparticles with several different shapes are formed, 
including large polygons (mainly triangles and hexagons) as well as smaller spheres. The lower 
contrast observed for the polygons suggests that they are flat, unlike the spherical nanoparticles 
around them (Figure 1a). Also, two planar particles overlap at some places (Figure 1b, see 
arrows), yielding a darker region. For comparison, the role of the incorporating alkyl group is 
revealed from experiments carried out with non-alkylated PEI. Interestingly, the TEM image of 
the gold colloid solution with PEI only shows the formation of spherical Au nanoparticles (Figure 
1c). 
Figure 2a shows a typical high resolution image of a triangle lamellar particle recorded for 
<111> incidence together with the corresponding diffraction pattern. The hexagonal symmetry of 
these pattern spots indicates that these nanoplates are single crystals bounded mainly by {111} 
facets [27]. Figure 2b shows that relatively strong fringes with a spacing of 2.50 Å, corresponding 
to the forbidden 1/3 {422} reflections [28] are present and that these fringes extend across the 
entire particle. On the other hand, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern recorded from the gold 
sample of PEI-1R (with the plate fraction of 79 %) is also displayed in Figure 2c, and the peaks 
are assigned to diffraction from the {111}, {200}, {220}, {311}, and {222} planes of fcc gold, 
respectively. It is worth noting that the ratio of the intensity between the {200} and {111} 
diffraction peaks is lower than the conventional value (0.157 versus 0.53) [29]. The ratio between 
the intensities of the {220} and {111} peaks is also lower than the conventional value (0.112 
versus 0.33). These observations demonstrate that the obtained nanoplates are primarily 
dominated by {111} facets, and thus the {111} planes tend to be preferential oriented parallel to 
the surface of the supporting substrate. 
From above analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the alkyl segments of alkylated PEIs 
play an important role on the formation of anisotropic gold nanocrystals in the aqueous solution. 
However, examination of the gold particles prepared through PEI-2R reveals that the fraction of 
 10
With the N/Au ratio of 5, the polymer aggregates of PEI-2R are more compact and 
well-structured with an average diameter of about 170 nm and a polydispersity (σ) of 0.17, 
whereas the aggregates of PEI-1R become more loosely packed (with σ = 0.69) in an acidic 
aqueous solution of HAuCl4. It was found that polymer hydrophobicity highly influenced the 
nanoparticle morphology. As shown in Figure 5, the polymer aggregates labeled with round 
necklace-like gold nanoparticles are easily observed for the most closely packed PEI-2R but can 
not be observed for polymers (PEI-1R, and PEI) with the rather dynamic and diffused polymer 
structures. In our previous study, it was found the alkyl groups directed the conformation of PEI 
chains resulting in a system giving effective protection to newly generated gold nanoparticles. 
The alkylated PEI served as a reducing agent other than a protective agent at the same time. The 
gold nanoparticles were generated in a restricted environment of the hydrophilic shell of polymer 
aggregates by introducing lipophiles. It can be found that there exists a close relationship between 
the structures of nanoparticles and the properties of polymer aggregates, i.e., PEI chains 
aggregate together and result in the coagulated gold nanoparticles (Figure 5c); well-structured 
and less-structured polymer aggregates of PEI-2R and PEI-1R respectively generated distinct and 
less distinct necklace-like nanostructures (Figure 5a, and Figure 5b, respectively). In this study, 
however, compact alkylated PEI aggregates will hinder the formation of plate-like gold particles 
by means of the formation of polymer aggregates in water rather than effectively adsorbing on 
certain crystallographic facets during growth of gold particles. As sown in Figure 6, the resulting 
gold lamellar plates were observed without existing spherical gold nanoparticles for PEI-1R 
aqueous solution at pH 2.7 (adding 0.1 M [HCl] 0.25 mL in the initial solution), but with some 
spherical gold particles at pH 3.6, and completely can not be observed at pH 7.8 (with the higher 
I1/I3 ratio of about 1.40, indicating that the PEI-1R aggregates are as closely packed as the 
commercial nonionic micelles (Triton series) which have comparable I1/I3 values to be 
1.47~1.40). 
We speculate that the incorporating alkyl groups of PEI-1R should induce higher coverage of 
amino groups on gold surface by not only the interactions between protonated amino groups and 
gold plates but also the interactions between the long hydrocarbon chains, leading to an efficient 
production of nanoplates. As the reaction was carried out in THF instead of H2O, it is interesting 
to find a totally reverse trend for the rates of particle formation and yields of non-spherical gold 
particles. In aqueous phase, the solutions were found to turn from pale yellow to red-violet for 
PEI-1R (after 30 min) and PEI-2R (after 2 h), indicating the formation of gold nanoparticles. 
However, for alkylated PEIs, the occurrence of color change in THF required more than one 
week, indicating that the reduction of gold salts was much slower than the parallel process in the 
aqueous phase. The solvophobicity of the alkane part of alkylated PEIs is expected to be 
significantly reduced as the reaction was carried out in THF instead of H2O. We speculate that the 
alkylated PEI molecules become more mobile in THF as compared with the parallel system in 
H2O, leading to the inhibition of the reaction between amino groups and gold ions. Without the 
incorporating alkyl group, growth of Au lamellar plates was not initially apparent for 
non-alkylated PEI in aqueous phase. However, as the reaction was conducted in THF, gold 
nanoparticles with several different shapes (but not plate-like) are formed after 24 h accomplished

Part 1 (??? Nanotechnology 20 (2009) 055603) 
Typically, the self-assembled spherical aggregates with a diameter of about 202 ± 22 nm 
(Figure 1a), formed with discrete nanoparticles, were synthesized from an acidic aqueous 
solution containing HAuCl4 and the alkylated triethylenetetramine at 25 °C. After mixing gold 
salts with C12E3 at a concentration of 8×10−3 mol/L amino groups ([N] / [Au] = 20), the solution 
gradually changed from colorless to red-violet, indicating the formation of gold nanoparticles. 
The interaction between individual particles is relatively weak, thus the spherical aggregates 
could be separated into discrete particles (with the mean diameter of about 18.7 nm) after being 
exhaustedly washed and collected by centrifugation as shown in Figure 1b. The discrete 
spherical gold particle with internal twinning defects is also shown in Figure 1c. The enlarged 
view (Figure 1d) shows that the edge of a spherical aggregate is constituted by individual gold 
particles of about 18 nm (shown by arrows), bound together by an organic substance. As shown 
in Figure 1a, the aggregates are darker than the amorphous-carbon support film since they are 
thicker. Because the observed bright field image is a shadow projection image, the shape of the 
aggregates could either be disks or cylinders. In order to confirm the shape of the gold 
aggregates, shadowing, which involves evaporating a thin heavy metal Pt coating at an oblique 
angle, is necessary (shown in Figure 2). Shadowing introduces some mass contrast to the 
thickness-contrast image, and the shape of the shadow reveals that of the spherical aggregates. 
Figure 3 shows the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of colloidal particles that have 
been exhaustively washed. There are gold peaks at 2.16, 9.71, and 11.43 keV, and the additional 
weak peak at 2.60 keV is characteristic of chlorine, which confirms that the chloride ion is 
associated with gold particles. The anion adsorption provides an anchoring point for positive 
ammonium ions, in order to preserve electroneutrality on the surface of gold particles. 
Consequently, the resulting alkylammonium organic layer acts as a barrier, providing an 
electrostatic repulsion and a steric hindrance between gold nanoparticles, preventing individual 
particles from coagulating. The influence of the charge density of polyamine on the adsorption 
process is expected to be very important. In order to investigate the pH effects of polyamine 
solution on the formation of gold particles, the initial pH values of Au colloid were adjusted with 
diluted hydrochloric acid or aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Figure 4 shows the TEM 
images of the Au colloidal solutions with pH values ranging from 9.0 to 2.5. With the molar ratio 
of N/Au fixed at 20, gold aggregates were observed at pH values of 5.0 and 3.2. However, gold 
aggregates could not be observed as pH was increased to 7.0 and 9.0. Furthermore, the diameter 
of the reduced gold particles was about 8~11 nm; much smaller than that prepared at pH 5.0 and 
3.2 (which had particle diameters of about 19 nm). It should be noted that polygonal plate-like 
Au particles were easily observed with the N/Au molar ratio of 20 at pH 2.5 (Figure 4e). 
In this study, as the pH increases from 3.2 to 7.0, the original gold aggregates (Figure 5a) 
disappear and are separated into discrete gold particles (Figure 5b). However, the spherical 
aggregates reappear with acidic treatment as shown in Figure 5c. This pH-responsive 
transformation is intriguing because the individual gold particles remain intact during the 
 26
observed the existence of protonated amino group with the peaks at around 3~4 ppm. At low pH, 
where a large fraction of the ethylenimine units are protonated, the cationic character of tetramine 
is responsible for its strong affinity to the negatively charged gold surface. However, as the amino 
groups become deprotonated with increasing pH value, the anion-induced ammonium adsorption 
was weakened and desorbed from the surface into the aqueous solution, resulting in the higher 
Au/N ratio observed in XPS results. In summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis of gold 
nanoparticles and that their self-assembly results in the formation of spherical aggregates with the 
alkylated amine. The reduced gold nanoparticles undergo pH-‘tunable’ aggregation under the 
mediation of the amino group to create intriguing microstructures.
