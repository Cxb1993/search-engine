Abstract— In this paper, we propose a method for designing
linear-phase (LP) square-root (SR) FIR filters incorporating
with the effects of analog parts in a communication system.
In the proposed method, the nonlinear phase distortion caused
by the analog filters is compensated first by inserting an FIR
filter that is the time reversal of the discrete-time equivalence
of the analog parts. Next, the proposed method employs a
constrained optimization algorithm to design the coefficients of
the desired FIR filter. Unlike the conventional design method
for LP FIR filters, the proposed method relaxes the passband
equiripple constraint imposed by the Remez exchange algorithm.
The proposed method takes the filter’s stopband attenuation, the
system’s tolerable ISI, and the opening of the eye pattern into
account simultaneously. Design examples show that using these
constraints can result in a more robust eye opening and thus a
more robust ISI performance in the presence of receiver clock
jitter.

I. INTRODUCTION
AMatched pair of square-root (SR) filters of a Nyquistfilter, used in the transmitter and the receiver of a band-
limited digital communication system, can provide zero inter-
symbol interference (ISI) [1]. In practice, the SR filters are re-
alized in FIR form. Conventionally, the SR filters are designed
by directly designing the Nyquist filter with a nonnegative
frequency response (ignoring the linear-phase factor) [2]–
[6], then getting the matched SR transmitter and receiver
filters by performing a spectral factorization on the Nyquist
filter polynomial. In this way, the SR filters usually have
asymmetrical coefficients.
Let N denote the filter length of the SR filters. Fig. 1 shows
the block diagram of a band-limited digital communication
system. For convenience, let ht[n] and hr[n] = ht[−n], n =
−(N−1)/2,−(N−3)/2, . . . , (N−1)/2, represent transmitter
and receiver FIR filter coefficients, respectively. Notably, we
allow indices to be . . . ,−3/2,−1/2, 1/2, 3/2, . . . when N is
even. Sm(s) and An(s) represent the transfer functions of
the analog smoothing filter and the analog anti-aliasing filter,
respectively. Having the analog parts in the system, we are
facing a hybrid FIR-filter/analog-filter pulse-shaping problem.
The designing of ht[n] and hr[n] must consider to compensate
the effects of the analog parts.
In [7], Coleman and Lytle design the optimal autocorrelation
sequence, h[n] = ht[n] ∗ hr[n], according to the magnitude

responses of Sm(s) and the digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
at the transmitter, and An(s) at the receiver. Their FIR filters,
ht[n] and hr[n], operate at 2 samples per baud. The problem
of such a low oversampling ratio is described as follows: The
mainlobe of the spectrum of the FIR filter will extend to the
transition band of the analog filters. However, the transition
band of an analog filter is sensitive to the variation of the
analog component values caused by temperature, aging, etc..
This will degrade the performance of the design in [7]. Another
problem of the design of [7] is that they only consider the
magnitude response of an analog filter. However, the phase
response of an analog filter is generally not linear. This
nonlinear phase distortion will disperse the signal waveform
in time domain such that compensating only the magnitude
distortion can not resolve the dispersion completely. This
situation is even worse at low over-sampling ratio that the
design of [7] employs.
A better way to cope with the component value variations of
analog parts is to employ higher oversampling ratio [8], [9]. A
design with high oversampling ratio allows the mainlobe of the
spectrum of the FIR filter to completely locate in the (relatively
flat) passbands of the analog filters. Since the passband of an
analog filter is relatively flat, its sensitivity to component value
variations is relatively small compared with the sensitivity of
the transition band. Therefore, in this paper, we study the cases
with oversampling ratio T > 2. In [8], all examples employ
oversampling ratio T = 4. However, [8] does not consider the
zero-order hold feature of a DAC. Also, [8] implicitly assumes
symmetry between the smoothing filter and the antialiasing
filter. Hence, the formulation in [8] for compensating analog
parts is not complete.
3Fig. 2. A baseband channel model.
hana(t) is causal, r(t) can be derived as
r(t) =
∞∑
m=0
a[m]
∫ t−mT0
max(0,t−(m+1)T0)
hana(τ) dτ.
Denote r[n] = r(nT0 + ǫ) and let
hˆt2t1 =
∫ t2
max(0,t1)
hana(τ) dτ, max(0, t1) ≤ t2,
then
r[n] =
∞∑
m=0
a[m]hˆ
(n−m)T0+ǫ
(n−m−1)T0+ǫ
. (1)
Since hana(τ) is causal, hˆ(n−m)T0+ǫ(n−m−1)T0+ǫ = 0 when (n−m)T0+
ǫ ≤ 0, which implies that only those terms with m ≤ n in (1)
are nonzero. Therefore, (1) can be rewritten as
r[n] =
n−1∑
m=0
a[m]hˆ
(n−m)T0+ǫ
(n−m−1)T0+ǫ
+ a[n]hˆǫ0 (2)
Next, denote
hǫΠ[n] =
{
hˆǫ0, n = 0
hˆnT0+ǫ(n−1)T0+ǫ, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Thus, (2) can be written as
r[n] = a[n] ∗ hǫΠ[n]
where ∗ represents the discrete-time convolution operation.
Hence, the channel in Fig. 2 can be modeled as a discrete-
time convolution of the transmitted data samples a[n], n =
0, 1, 2, . . . , and the channel’s equivalent discrete-time impulse
response hǫΠ[n]. Notably, hana(t) is essentially time limited
in practice [8], so is hǫΠ[n]. Therefore, the channel can be
modeled as an FIR channel in practice.
In general, since the sampling rate 1/T0 and the analog
filters Sm(s) and An(s) are known a priori, we can use them
to construct an M -tap FIR channel equivalence h˜0Π[n], n =
0, 1, . . . ,M − 1, by truncating the first M samples of h0Π[n].
Next, let
hins[n] = h˜
0
Π[M − 1 − n]. (3)
Thus, h˜0Π[n] ∗ hins[n] will possess a linear phase response.
This implies that the nonlinear phase distortion introduced
by Sm(s) and An(s) can be approximately compensated by
inserting hins[n] in the transmitter or receiver.
It is noted that the values of hǫΠ[n] depend on ǫ. Therefore,
different timing offset ǫ leads to different hǫΠ[n]. The phase
equalization FIR filter hins[n] does not correct the sampling
timing offset, it just equalize the phase response of the system.
In order to obtain an optimum sampling timing, a clock
recovery subsystem is required, which is beyond the scope
of this paper.
III. THE FORMULATIONS OF BASIC TIME-DOMAIN AND
FREQUENCY-DOMAIN RESPONSES
By inserting hins[n] in the system, the previous section
has shown that the phase response of the analog parts can
be approximately linearized. Next, denote
hD[n] = h˜
0
Π[n] ∗ hins[n].
The length of hD[n] is 2M − 1. For convenience, we assume
that hD[n] spans across n = −M+1, . . . ,−1, 0, 1, . . . ,M−1.
Recall that N denotes the length of the SR filter. Since
we discuss symmetrical SR filters and ht[n] = hr[n], h[n] =
ht[n] ∗ hr[n] = ht[n] ∗ ht[n]. Then for |n| ≤ N − 1
h[n] =


N−1
2∑
k=1
ht[k]
(
ht[n + k] + ht[n− k]
)
+ ht[0]ht[n],
N ∈ odd
N−1
2∑
k=1/2
ht[k]
(
ht[n+ k] + ht[n− k]
)
, N ∈ even
(4)
where ht[l] = 0 when |l| > (N − 1)/2.
We can further employ the technique introduced in [13] to
express (4) in the matrix form. Let
ht =
{
( ht[0] ht[1] · · · ht[
N−1
2 ] )
T , N ∈ odd
( ht[
1
2 ] ht[
3
2 ] · · · ht[
N−1
2 ] )
T , N ∈ even
(5)
and let Sn, |n| ≤ N −1, be an N ×N matrix whose kth-row,
lth-column element is given by [13]
(Sn)k,l =
{
1, k − l = n
0, otherwise. (6)
Denote Il and Jl as the l × l identity matrix and the l × l
antidiagonal matrix, respectively. Let
E =


)
, N ∈ odd(

, N ∈ even
(7)
Then (4) can be rewritten as, for |n| ≤ N − 1,
h[n] = ht
T
E

SnEht.
Denote Sˆn = ETSnE, then
h[n] = ht
T
Sˆnht. (8)
The complete impulse response of the system, including
the equivalent FIR channel model of the analog parts and the
phase-equalizing FIR filter hins[n], can be written as
hc[n] =
N−1∑
m=1
h[m]

hD[n+m] + hD[n−m]
)
+ h[0]hD[n]

. (17)
A larger EYE value corresponds to a better eye opening. We
note that if T = 2, both the numerator and the denominator
of (17) contain the term hc[1]. In this case, even the maxi-
mum value of EYE is still poor. Therefore, the eye-opening
technique presented in this paper applies only for cases where
T > 2, which coincides with our argument stated in Section I.
It is also noted that the upper index of the second summation
in the denominator of (17) is ⌈(Nˆ − 1)/T ⌉ − 1 in order that
the summation will not contain the term hc[Nˆ ] if Nˆ − 1 is
divisible by T .
In a manner similar to the ISI case, we express EYE in
terms of ht. We introduce ⌊Nˆ/T ⌋+ ⌈(Nˆ − 1)/T ⌉ − 1 slack
varables, bj , j = 1, 2, . . . , ⌊Nˆ/T ⌋, and cj , j = 1, 2, . . . , ⌈(Nˆ−
1)/T ⌉ − 1, and write

Similar to the ISI case, we denote γEYE as the specification
of the eye opening. Then, the eye opening constraint can be
expressed as
⌊ Nˆ

It is noted that in the above formulations, we keep all
equations and inequlities in the first-order or the second-order
form of ht. On the other hand, the formulation of [13] is in
the fourth-order form of ht.
V. THE DESIGN PROBLEM FORMULATION
Having Expressed hc[0], the frequency responses, ISI, and
EYE, in terms of of ht, in Eqs. (10)–(20), we can now
formulate our design problem. Let ηmax denote the specified
gain limit in stopband and η denote the achieved maximum
stopband gain (in linear scale) of the FIR SR filter. The design
problem becomes:

attenuation (SBATT) of the SR filter is 23.5 dB, the roll-off
factor α = 0.5, and the over-sampling ratio T = 6.
The first SR filter is asymmetrical and is designed by the
conventional method. It has 18 taps. The second SR filter
is symmetrical and is designed by the proposed method. It
has 23 taps and can produce a h(n) with −100 dB ISI.
These two SR filters are used for comparison purposes, so
the eye-opening constraints are not implemented. The filter
designed by the method ignoring eye-opening constraints is
designated a ‘design without EYE control’. The third SR
filter is asymmetrical and is designed by the method given
in [18]. It possesses 29 taps and can produce an h(n) with
−40 dB ISI and with γEYE = 10.7 dB. The last SR filter
is symmetrical and is designed by the proposed method. Its
length is 44. It can also produce an h(n) with −40 dB ISI
and with γEYE = 10.7 dB. The filter designed by the method

with eye-opening constraints is designated a ‘design with EYE
control’. Coefficients of the asymmetrical SR filter and LP SR
filters are shown in Table II. We note that both asymmetrical
SR filters are of minimum phase.
Next, receiver clock jitter is applied. The receiver clock may
not be synchronous with the symbol timing at the transmitter.
This will degrade the ISI performance. Fig. 6 shows the
simulation results for four communication systems employing
the four SR filters mentioned above, in the presence of receiver
clock jitter. The horizontal axis is the standard deviation of the
receiver clock jitter σ divided by T .
For the first SR filter and the second SR filter without
EYE control, although the ISI is extremely low at low clock
jitter, it degrades very fast as the jitter increases. For the first
SR filter, when the receiver timing jitter reaches 0.048T , the
ISI degrades to −23 dB. Recall that, in [12], [14], −23 dB
ISI won’t deteriorate the BER performance at the operating
point of 10 dB SNR. For the second SR filter, when the
timing jitter reaches 0.045T , the ISI degrades from −100
dB to −23 dB. Comparing with the ISI degradation for the
conventional asymmetrical SR filter with comparable SBATT
and ISI, the LP SR filter is more sensitive to receiver timing
jitter. This is because, with comparable SBATT and ISI, the LP
SR filter is longer than the asymmetrical SR filter. Therefore,
the length of h(n) resulting from the LP SR filter is also
longer than that which results from the asymmetrical SR filter.
Hence, when the receiver timing jitter is severe, more ‘off-
grid’ distant symbols will interfere with the current symbol.
However, in this example, the conventional asymmetrical SR
filter requires 18 multipliers while the LP SR filter requires
only 12 multipliers. Thus, the hardware complexity of the LP
SR filter is lower than that of the conventional asymmetrical
SR filter.
Next, the eye-opening constraint is implemented. For the
−40 dB-ISI asymmetrical SR filter with EYE control, the ISI
degrades from −40 dB to −23 dB at 0.051T timing jitter.
Similarly, for the LP SR filter with EYE control, the ISI
9symmetric SR filter pair with comparable SBATT, ISI and
EYE. Therefore, the symmetric SR filters are suitable in a
communication system wherein different manufacturers pro-
duce transmitters and receivers.

Abstract—This paper presents a method of combining the 
design and the implementation of fixed-point FIR filter 
coefficients into one design flow. The proposed method designs the 
fixed-point coefficients in an expanding subexpression space. 
During the design process, the implementation cost is estimated as 
well and it is fed back to the design routine such that the 
algorithm can redesign the fixed-point coefficients iteratively. 
Design examples show that, in many cases, we can obtain better 
hardware-cost- effective FIR filters than the results reported by 
other researchers. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Digital filters are essential in digital signal processing 
(DSP) or communication systems. To implement a digital filter 
in a DSP or communication system efficiently becomes an 
emerging issue in the research area of digital filter design.  In 
the past two decades, many results of FIR filter fixed-point 
coefficient design and realization have been published [1]-[23]. 
First, the coefficients are designed in binary formats or in 
canonic sign digit (CSD) formats. Since each nonzero digit of 
the fixed-point coefficients costs an adder, many researchers 
try to minimize the number of nonzero digits in the coefficient 
design phase. Next, fixed-point coefficients are realized by a 
common subexpression elimination (CSE) method [12]-[16] or 
by a graph method [17]-[21] to reduce the hardware complexity. 
Fig.1 shows an example of a conventional coefficient 
realization. The same pattern among coefficients, called a 
common subexpression by the CSE researchers or a partial sum 
by the graph method researchers, is detected and is processed 
only once. Thus, the number of adders can be reduced. Since 
the fixed-point coefficients are designed and realized 
separately, the resultant hardware may not be the most cost 
effective one [22], [23]. 
In [22], a method combines MILP and CSE was proposed. 
Their method is optimal in terms of hardware complexity. 
However, the computation complexity is too high such that 
their method is only applicable to very simple FIR filters that 
are not practical in most situations.  
In [23], a new concept of subexpression space was proposed. 
Unlike the conventional flow in which the fixed-point 
coefficients are determined first followed by searching for 
common subexpressions, their method first determines a set of 
subexpressions called a basis set. Next their algorithm 
constructs the fixed-point coefficients only using combinations

under Grant NSC 97-2221-E-011-139. 
of the numbers in the basis set. Because the hardware cost of 
implementing each number in the basis set is known a priori, 
their method can calculate the overall hardware complexity at 
the same time as they design the corresponding fixed-point 
coefficients. Therefore, they can find an optimal solution in 
terms of the hardware cost based on the chosen basis set. 
Although a rule of thumb for choosing a basis set is given in 
[23], there is no way to verify if the basis set is truly the best 
one for the desired FIR filter. Although the concept given in [23] 
is a breakthrough, there is still room that we can improve. 
In this paper, we suggest an improved fixed-point coefficient 
design process that considers the implementation complexity at 
the first stage of the design phase. The new concept that we 
propose is the expanding subexpression space that will be 
explained later. We combine two methods: one is using the 
expanding subexpression space to construct the fixed-point FIR 
coefficients; the other is confining our searching range between 
the upper bound and the lower bound of each coefficient to 
accelerate the design process [11]. The architecture we assume 
in this paper is the transposed form symmetrical FIR filter. 
Compared with the previously published results in [11], [16], 
and [23], the proposed method can produce FIR filters with 
reduced number of adders in many cases. In the meantime, the 
limitation of requiring a good basis set as the method in [23] is 
relaxed by using the proposed algorithm. 
On the other hand, since the way of realizing the transposed 
form FIR filters is determined by the proposed method, in order 
to save brainpower and time for writing the RTL code of an FIR 
filter, we develop a C program to generate a Verilog or a VHDL 
code of the FIR filter automatically based on the coefficients 
produced by the proposed algorithm. A comparison of the code 
performance between the proposed design flow and Matlab’s 
fdatool is also given in this paper.

 A branch and bound process employed in the proposed 
method is as follows: 
b&b(i) { 
 if (i–1 < ⎣(N – 1)/2⎦){ 
 if (~(hmin(i–1) ≤ h i–1,0 or h i–1,1 ≤ hmax(i–1))){ 
 Infeasible (mark 1); 
 return; 
 } 
 if (hmin(i–1) ≤ h i–1,0 ≤ hmax(i–1)) { 
 hi–1 = h i–1,0; 
 Expand S = S ∪ {hi–1 >>}; 
 body; 
 Shrink S = S \ {hi–1  >>}; 
 } 
 if (hmin(i–1) ≤ h i–1,1 ≤ hmax(i–1)) { 
 hi–1 = h i–1,1; 
 Expand S = S ∪ {hi–1 >>}; 
 body; 
 Shrink S = S \ {hi–1 >>}; 
 } 
 } 
 else{ 
 for(j = 0; j ≤ 1; j ++){ 
 hi–1 = h i–1,j; 
 if(the solution satisfies the spec.) 
 if(Abest ≥ A⎣(N – 1)/2⎦ ){ 
 Save the fixed-point coefficients; 
 Abest = A⎣(N – 1)/2⎦; 
 } 
 else 
 Infeasible (mark 2); 
 } 
 return; 
 } 
} 
where hi–1 >> represents continuously right-shifting hi–1 until it 
becomes odd. The process body is shown as follows： 
body{ 
 if(Ai-1+Aps(i) ≥ Abest or Ai-1 > Aes(i−1)+Mc) { 
 Cut branch; 
 return; 
 } 
 else{ 
 Solve the minimization problem (4). 
 if (δ ≤ δp)  
 b&b(i+1); 
 else { 
 Infeasible (mark 3); 
 return; 
 } 
 } 
} 
It is noted that searching for optimal fixed-point 
coefficients (in the sense of hardware complexity) of an FIR 
filter is an NP-complete problem. The size of the binary tree 
grows exponentially as the filter length increases. Therefore, 
we must have a cut-back strategy such that the algorithm can 
obtain a cost-effective solution in a reasonable period of time. 
The cut-back step is realized in the first if-block of the process 
body. We can see that the algorithm checks two things: First, 
examining Ai-1+Aps(i) ≥ Abest checks whether the predicted 
number of adders exceeds the limit. Second, examining Ai-1 > 
Aes(i−1)+Mc checks whether the number of realized adders 
counted up to the current coefficient exceeds a margin plus the 
corresponding number of realized adders that belongs to the 
up-to-date solution. 
The proposed algorithm invokes linear programming (3) and 
(4) several times. The constraints in (3) and (4) are 
semi-infinite constraints in that they must be satisfied for all 
values of ω. This can be solved by employing the method 
shown in [24] that incrementally includes extreme points from 
the previous iteration to the constraints. Hence, we don’t need 
to sample ω in a very dense manner. 
III. EXAMPLES 
Example 1: We use the proposed method to design five filters. 
L1 and L2 are filters originally given in Examples 1 and 2 of [2]. 
S1 and S2 are the filters originally given in Examples 1 and 2 of 
[3]. “A” is the filter A originally given in [11].  
Table I summarizes the required number of adders of the 
proposed method and the results given in [16], [11], and [23].  
It is noted that the method of [16] considering the fixed-point 
coefficient design and implementation separately. [16] is used 
here as a background reference. One can see that all three 
methods (the proposed, [11], and [23]) outperform the results in 
[16]. Notably, the proposed method and the method in [23] 
combine the design and implementation into one flow. 
On the other hand, the number of adders produced by the 
proposed method is no more than that reported in [11] or [23]. 
Especially in L1 and S2, the number of adders produced by the 
proposed method is 81.8% and 84.2% of the best results ever 
published in [23], respectively. 
Example 2: In spreading rate 1 of CDMA2000 [25], a baseband 
FIR filter of length 48 is employed. The specifications of this 
filter is given in Table II. We compare the Verilog code 
performance of the FIR filter generated by the automatic design
