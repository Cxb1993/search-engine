一、前言
隨著半導體製程往縮小體積與提高導
線密度的方向發展，半導體元件的尺寸亦跟
著縮小，使金屬線之間的寄生電容也越來越
大，電阻-電容時間延遲、訊號間的相互干
擾之問題日益嚴重。在金屬內連線之間的介
電層使用低介電常數的材料可以解決電阻-
電容時間延遲的問題。於薄膜中導入孔洞可
以有效降低材料之介電常數。傳統之製法需
以孔洞封閉製程在薄膜表面形成非孔洞表
層，以解決後續製程中銅離子遷移問題。
二、研究目的
本研究希望可以製作新型之多孔性低介
電材料。利用高分子加入中空球粒子，先經
由電泳處理再以照光聚合之方式製備成梯
度分布之多孔性低介電薄膜。不需傳統之孔
洞封閉製程即可在薄膜表面形成非孔洞表
層，以解決後續製程中銅離子遷移問題。帶
負電的高分子中空球粒子先分散在起始劑
和單體中，於電泳處理時會移向陽極，再以
紫外線交聯硬化之後製成梯度分布孔洞之
薄膜。此外，本研究以二氧化鈦包覆高分子
中空球，在和Polyamic acid製成多孔性聚亞
醯胺之耐熱性低介電材料。研究中希望透過
電泳及光聚合之概念製作新型之梯度孔洞
分布低介電材料，並以二氧化鈦包覆中空球
製成耐化、耐熱中空球以導入聚亞醯胺薄
膜，探討材料製程、薄膜微結構分析以及孔
洞分布對低介電特性之影響。
三、文獻探討
聚合物是低介電的應用的潛在具吸引力
的材料。Hydrogen silsesquioxane薄之介電常
數在2.8-3.0範圍[1],當methyl silsesquioxane
薄膜的介電常數介於2.7–2.9。由pyromellitic
dianhydride 和 1,1-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-1
-phenyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethane[2]製備之聚亞
醯胺有大約2.35的介電值。將孔洞導入高分
子的材料可以進一步降低介電常數[3,4].有
許 多 方 法 可 用 於 控 制 孔 洞 結 構 。

材料介電值的方法之一[5]. 聚亞醯胺奈米

acid-graft-fluorinated polyimide) [6]介電值
為1.9。接枝於聚亞醯胺的側鏈分解後行成
之孔洞。此種多孔的低介電材料包含隨意分
佈的micropores。多孔低介電材料之孔洞分
佈對薄膜的介電性質之影響尚未被完整的
研究。三維的微孔(microporous)或奈米孔洞
(nanoporous)材料可以應用於包括超微薄膜
(ultrafiltration)，逆滲透，氣體分離[7], 觸媒
與光資訊處理等應用[8,9]使梯度為孔洞的
最常見的方法是相轉換法(phase inversion
method)。
四、研究方法
圖1所示為以電泳方式製作垂直孔洞
梯度分布薄膜之製程。在ITO玻璃上以聚酯
間隔形成一個方形的封閉區域，中空球粒子
的分散液與紫外線硬化的成分內混合後注
入上述區域。另一ITO 玻璃作為對電極。
夾在中間的液體混合物以電壓30伏特作用
15分，吸引中空球粒子往底部之陽極移動。
移去上面ITO 玻璃後再經一步或多步烘烤
與紫外線硬化反應製成薄膜。一步烘烤之薄
膜先在50℃真空烘烤30分除水分，再照紫外
線5分鐘進行交聯硬化反應。多步烘烤過程
薄膜分別在30℃、40℃、50℃各真空烘烤10
分，再照紫外線進行交聯硬化反應。
秤取 PVP 及去離子水(調整至 PH=3)，加
入無水乙醇中攪拌。取 LHP 中空球加入步
驟 1 之溶液中攪拌。用 10ml 無水乙醇將醇
酞前驅物稀釋後攪拌，稀釋成醇酞溶液，再
快速加入前述之溶液中攪拌 3 小時。將產物
用離心方式取出，並進行清洗。改變 LHP
與 TTIP 量的比值。使用三種不同比例
LHP-TTIP (0.5g-2g)、LHP-TTIP (0.5g-3g)、
LHP-TTIP (0.5g-4g) 分別作成 TiO2-A ，
TiO2-B ， TiO2-C 中 空 球 。 4,4'-Diamino
diphenyl ether 先加入 DMF 溶解均勻混合，
再加入 4,4-Carbonyl diphthalic anhydride (莫
耳比=1：1)，攪拌 12 小時製成 Polyamic acid
作之樣品可以看到LHP中空粒子凝聚成聚
集之粒子，TiO2無法均勻的長在每ㄧ顆LHP
表面上。由圖7(c)可以看出TTIP(異丙基醇酞)
的濃度增加後使核殼複合粒子形狀逐漸成
為不規則形，且有聚集的現象更嚴重。由圖
7(d)可以得知三種TiO2中空球經過400℃的
熱處理後已有結晶晶型的產生，可以知道在
400℃的熱處理所得之晶相為anatase(銳鈦
礦)，證明中空球外已經包覆TiO2之殼層。
圖8(a)顯示以LHP直接加入PAA溶液
製成薄膜截面之SEM圖，可以看出LHP中空
粒子已被DMF溶劑溶解，所以看到的截面
沒有孔洞的分布。把LHP-TiO2中空球加入
PAA溶液中均勻混合，塗膜再經烘烤後可製
備具封閉性孔洞之多孔PITA薄膜(圖8(b))。
PITA薄膜截面利用能量散佈光譜儀(EDX)
測出薄膜的元素(圖8(c))，總計含有C元素、
O元素、鍍白金所產生的Pt、玻璃基板所的
Si元素，還有Ti元素。因此可知在薄膜上有
TiO2中空球殼層。由圖8(d)純PI、PITA薄膜
的介電常數可以知道與純聚亞醯胺薄膜相
比，加入中空球粒子會增加薄膜的孔隙度，
使介電常數下降。
六、計畫成果自評：

1. Introduction
In addition to the pigment dispersion process that is widely used for mass
production, ink-jet methods are designed for manufacturing the color filter.[1-4] Inks
containing the red (R), green (G) or blue (B) colorants are ejected via nozzles onto the
glass substrate, and the jet-printed inks are dried to form color-filter pixels. Two kinds of
ink-jet process were developed for making color filters. The first process involves an
ink-receiver layer. Since the glass substrate can not adsorb inks, the receiver layer must
be coated onto the substrate before printing. [5-6] Then, the ink-jet inks can be absorbed
1:1) polymer.
The other binders were synthesized by the reaction scheme shown in Figure 1.
4-Amino-N-methylphthalimide (AMP) and DGB were dissolved in DMF and refluxed at
150℃ for 6h. PPA was mixed with the AMP-DGB solution and reacted at 100℃ for 6h
to prepare the AMPPD (AMP:DGB:PPA=1:2:1) polymer.
N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)phthalimide and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride (BTCA) were
dissolved in DMF and reacted at 90 ℃ for 8h to synthesize the BIB monomer. DGB was
mixed with the BIB solution and reacted at 100 ℃ for 6h. PPA was dissolved in DMF
and mixed with the BIB-DGB solution. The mixed solution was reacted at 100 ℃ for 6h
to prepare the BIBPD (BIB:DGB:PPA=1:2:1) polymer. PPA, 2-acryloyloxyethyl
phosphate (PA) and DGB were dissolved in DMF and reacted at 90℃ for 6h to prepare
the PPADP (PPA:DGB:PA=9:10:1) oligomer.
Blue pigment (Clariant) containing 50% phthalocyanine pigment in a vinyl
chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer carrier material was added as colorant. The ingredients
of the PPADP3 ink included blue pigment (0.25g), tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate
(4.05g), PPADP (0.3g), ITX/907 (0.2g), pentaerythritol triacrylate (2.5g) and
dipentaerythritol hexnacrylate (2.7g). The BIBPDI ink was prepared by similar
ingredients except PPADP and pentaerythritol triacrylate were replaced by BIBPD (0.1g)
and pentaerythritol triacrylate (2.7g).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TGA2950 apparatus from
TA Instruments at a scan rate of 10℃/min under nitrogen atmosphere. The transmittance
spectra of the films were recorded by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi UV-3000).
to large improvement in the thermal stability. AMPPD, BIBPD and PPAD showed similar
Td. The temperature of rapid weight loss of BIBPD shifted to higher temperature region.
The TGA curve dropped rapidly after 600 ℃. AMPPD, BIBPD and PPAD showed better
thermal resistant properties than the cured PPADP. However, all binders (with Td230℃)
can be used in the CF application.
The nanoindentation technique is a useful tool for the determination of the
mechanical properties of thin films, including polymers.[15-16] The force–depth curves
(Figure 3) showed a typical remaining plastic deformation of the four binders during
indentation. The hardness of AMPPD, BIBPD, PPADA and PPAD (at max load= 1000
N) were 0.28, 0.27, 0.24 and 0.22 GPa respectively. However, the films showed nearly
the same modulus. The modulus of AMPPD, BIBPD, PPADA and PPAD were 7.6, 7.8,
7.7 and 7.7 GPa respectively. AMPPD polymer with bulky phenylphosphonic and
phthalimide side chain showed the highest hardness of all films. The phthalimide group
of AMPPD is directly attached on the main polymer chain. The phthalimide group of
BIBPD is attached on the main polymer chain through a short flexible aliphatic ester
spacer. Although the cured PPADP is a crosslinked polymer, the aliphatic
acryloyloxyethyl side chain may increase the free volume of the polymer and lead to
lower hardness than the AMPPD film. The high hardness and modulus exhibited by
AMPPD film in nanoindentation evaluations indicate their greater resistance to plastic
deformation and local penetration on application of external force.
Although cured PPADP showed lower heat resistance than the AMPPD, BIBPD and
was not compatible with the blue pigment. BIBPD cannot be used as the ink composition
for the nonvolatile jet-printed ink for CF manufacturing. The OM image of the blue stripe
printed by PPADP3 ink was shown in Figure 5(b). Stripes with straight edges and good
color uniformity were prepared on the glass substrate. The surface morphology of the
printed stripe was measured by SEM. The SEM image of the stripe was shown in Figure
6. The stripe showed smooth surface and straight line edge. The outer regions near the
two edges are slightly higher than the central region. The mechanical properties of the
printed stripes were investigated by the nanoindentation test. Well-defined indentation
impressions were made on the tiny stripe to detect the hardness and modulus. The
hardness and modulus at max load are 3.94 and 72.15 GPa respectively.
4. Conclusions
Phosphated epoxy acrylate PPADP oligomer with pendent phosphated acrylate
exhibited good solubility in the UV curable monomer, tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate. It
can be used as compositions of nonvolatile UV curable ink for manufacturing the
jet-printed LCD color filter. It also showed good pigment compatibility, good mechanical
property, moderate transparency and thermal properties. No receiver layer or barrier ribs
are necessary to prevent the printed ink from overflowing to the neighboring area. The
color inks were precisely ejected to the glass substrate and UV-cured immediately to
make the stripe pattern. The printed stripes exhibited smooth surface, straight edge, high
transparency (transmittance > 84%), good thermal properties, high nanoindentation
hardness (3.94 GPa) and modulus (72.15 GPa). BIBPD with pendent phthalimide
segments as thermal resistant binder showed poor solubility in monomer and poor

Abstract
Vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods were grown on the ITO glass by the
hydrothermal approach. Then, the conjugated polymer poly(2,3-dibutoxy-1,4- phenylene
vinylene) (DB-PPV) was coated on the nanorods to make the hybrid films. Nanorods
1. Introduction
Recently, it has been shown that composite materials containing the nanostructured
electronaccepting component and the electron-donating organic semiconductor in a “bulk 
heterojunction” structure are promising materials for photovoltaic device.[1] Ultra-fast
photoinduced charge transfer occurs between the conjugated polymers and the metal
oxide semiconductor such as TiO2, or ZnO [2].
However, the overall performance of such devices is still disappointing because of
limited charge transport and charge separation efficiency. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is of interest
because of its availability of low temperature synthesis, the high electron mobility, and
the potential for preparing the ordered nanostructure by the solution process. Solution
synthesis offers the potential for much lower cost because it eliminates the expenses
associated with high temperature and vacuum processing. Besides, solution processing is
compatible with roll-to-roll processing of flexible plastic substrates. ZnO nanorods grown
perpendicular to the substrate are particularly interesting. Perpendicularly oriented
single-crystalline ZnO nanorod arrays have been recently fabricated on sapphire
substrates using VLS [3] and CVD methods [4]. These methods involve complex
procedures, sophisticated equipment and high temperature Recently, O’Brien et al.[5] and 
Vayssieres [6] reported the low temperature growth of ZnO nanocolumns from aqueous
solution. A promising route to increasing the efficiencies of these photovoltaic devices is
to use ZnO nanorods that is vertically aligned with respect to the substrate [7,8]. The
ordered zinc oxide nanorods acted as electron acceptors and provided the direct path for
photogenerated electrons to the collecting electrode. If the electrons diffuse through the
60 ℃ for 2 h to yield a homogeneous and stable colloid solution, which served as coating
solution. The coating colloid solution was coated onto the ITO substrates. Then the
substrates were dried and annealed at 300 ℃ for 1 h. The ZnO nanorod array was grown
at 95 ℃ in a sealed bottle by immersing the modified substrates in the aqueous solution
containing Zn(NO3)2 (0.05 M) and methenamine (0.05 M). ZnO12 and ZnO14 films
mean the rod growth time are 2 and 4 hours respectively. DB-PPV was dissolved in THF
and spin-coated onto the ZnO rod array at 700 rpm for 10 seconds. DBZ12 and DBZ14
films represent the hybrid film prepared by DB-PPV coated ZnO12 and ZnO14 films
respectively.
XRD studies were carried out with a MAC SCIENCE MXP3 diffractometer. The
morphology of the nanorods was characterized using scanning electron microscopy using
a HITACHI S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. The
photoluminescence spectra were measured by the PL2006 Multifunction Fluorescent
Spectrometer (Labguide co.)
3. Results and Discussion
The morphology of ZnO nanorods was characterized by SEM. Figure 1 shows a
top-view image of the ZnO nanorods. It reveals that all nanorods grew in a direction
perpendicular to the substrate. Vertically aligned arrays of ZnO nanorods were uniformly
grown on the ZnO12 sample with the diameters varying from 25 to 50 nm. The diameter
of the ZnO rod on the ZnO14 sample altered from 65 to 165 nm. Increasing the rod
growth time widened the rod diameter. There are some closely packed rods that the
film did. Tr and Td of the DBZ14 film are 15 and 35 seconds respectively. There is no
current accumulation after repeated test cycles. However, the photocurrent of the DBZ14
film was lower than that of the DBZ12 film. The DBZ14 film with larger ZnO rod should
larger ZnO surface area than the DBZ12 film did. If the ZnO surface is completely
covered by DB-PPV, there will be more donor-acceptor interface area (P-N junction) for
the DBZ14 film. More incident photons are absorbed. Because of efficient dissociation of
generated excitons and subsequent transport of charge carriers, photocurrent should
increase with increasing surface area. However, the measured photocurrent of DBZ14
film was lower than that of the DBZ12 film. To check the coverage of DB-PPV polymer
on the ZnO rod, the cross-sectional images of both films were observed by FESEM.
Figure 4(a) showed the cross-sectional SEM image of DB-PPV polymer infiltrated
into the DBZ12 nanorod array structure. The polymer can be effectively intercalated into
the ZnO rods film thus making a nanostructured oxide / conjugated polymer composite
device. The thickness of the hybrid film is about 500nm. Figure 4(b) showed the
cross-sectional SEM image of DBZ14 hybrid film. There were some ZnO nanorods that
were not covered by the DB-PPV polymer. It may be the reason why the DBZ14 film
exhibit lower photocurrent than the DBZ12 film did, although the former had larger ZnO
surface area than the latter. The donor-acceptor interface area (P-N junction) of the
DBZ14 film will be less than that of the DBZ12 film because of poor wetting of ZnO
nanorod by the DB-PPV. The closely packed rods with almost zero inter-rod distance
(shown in Figure 1(b)) hindered the infiltration of polymer into the nanorod array. The
thickness of the hybrid film is about 1m.
less planar conformation [14]. That is, polymer chains in pure conjugated polymer
favored shorter conjugated length. Attaching of the polymer chains on the ZnO nanorod
surface favors more planar molecular orientations, and the more planar orientations lead
to an increase in effective conjugation length and a resultant of the red shift. Thus
nanocomposite resulted in the enhancement of the one at 555 nm, and the suppression of
the peak at 540 nm.
Figure 5(b) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of ZnO14 nanorods excited
with 350 nm emission. PL measurement of ZnO14 show strong emission at 400 nm with
some defect emission located between 500-650 nm. For the DBZ14 hybrid film, the
maximum located at 530 nm, with a shoulder at 555 nm. The PL spectrum of DBZ14
hybrid film also showed a red-shift at the right half of the peak.
4. Conclusions
Vertically aligned ZnO nanorods were used as electron acceptors that present a direct
and ordered path for photogenerated electrons to the collecting electrode. ZnO14 film
with longer rod-growth time showed larger rod diameter and smaller distances between
the ZnO rods than the ZnO12 analog did. Decreased distances between the rods made the
structure difficult to be filled with DB-PPV polymer. ZnO nanorods that were not
covered by DB-PPV were observed in the cross-sectional SEM images of the DBZ14
film. It leads to the decrease of the PN junction area and low photocurrent of the DBZ14
film. It may be the reason why the photocurrent of the DBZ12 hybrid film is larger than
that of the DBZ14 hybrid film. The red shift of the photoluminescence spectra suggested

Abstract
Poly(amide-imide)/titania (PAI/TiO2) nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated through
the in situ formation of TiO2 within a PAI matrix by sol-gel process. 3,3',4,4'-Benzophenone
tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), 2,2-bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]propane (p-BAPP),
trimellitic anhydride chloride (TMAC) and N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent are mixed
entirely and reacted at room temperature to form the poly(amide amic acid) solution. Tetraethyl
orthotitanate (Ti(OEt)4) and actylacetone (ACAC), the latter one is used as chelating agent, are then
added to the poly(amide amic acid). Through the sol-gel process and imidization reaction, the
PAI/TiO2 nanocomposite films are formed. In this study, the addition of TMAC to the PAI/TiO2
nanocomposite films is employed to provide the intermolecular hydrogen-bonded between the PAI
and PAI or titania. Comparisons of the characteristics between TMAC containing PAI/TiO2 hybrid
films and pure polyimide/titania (PI/TiO2) hybrid are investigated. The result indicates that the
flexibility and toughness of TMAC containing PAI/TiO2 nanocomposite films are improved and the
titania is dispersed well within PAI matrix as compared with pure PI/TiO2. Through the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) results, the TiO2 particle sizes of PAI/TiO2 (TiO2 is 8.12
wt. %) are between 40-90 nm. Based on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis, the TiO2
content on the surface of PAI/TiO2 is higher than that of PI/TiO2 nanocomposite film. Thermal
2.1. Materials
2,2-bis[4-(4-Aminophenoxy)phenyl]propane (p-BAPP, 98%) from Aldrich Chemical Company
is dried in a vacuum oven at 85℃ for 8h prior to use. 3,3', 4,4'-Benzophenonetetracarboxylic
dianhydride (BTDA) from ACORS Company is purified by recrystallization from acetic anhydride
and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120℃ overnight. The titania additive of tetraethyl orthotitanate
(Ti(OEt)4), acetylacetone (ACAC) and trimellitic anhydride chloride (TMAC) from Tokyo
Chemical Industry (TCI) are used as supplied. N, N-Dimethyl formamide (DMF) from Tedia
Company is dehydrated with molecular sieves.
2.2. Synthesis
The flowchart of the procedures to prepare the PAI/TiO2 nanocomposite films is shown in Fig. 1.
The poly(amide amic acid) solutions are made by reacting stoichiometrical amount of p-BAPP,
TMAC, BTDA (molar raito of p-BAPP: TMAC: BTDA = 1: 0.3: 0.7) and suitable amount of DMF
under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirring for 2 h. After this period, modified poly(amic amic acid)
solutions are made by adding the mixture of Ti(OEt)4 and ACAC (molar ratio of Ti(OEt)4 to ACAC
is fixed to 1:4) and stirring for 12 h. Pour the the poly(amide amic acid ) solution onto a glass plate,
and then 250 μm thick film obtained by knife coating. Through the sol-gel process and
imidization
reaction, the nanocomposite films are formed. Sample abbreviations are named as XT-PAI and
XT-PI. X denotes the weight percentage of TiO2 within polymer matrix and T is represents as the
TiO2. The TiO2 concentration (X=2.18, 8.12, 13.20 wt.%) are assuming that complete imidization
and complete conversion of the Ti(OEt)4 to the TiO2. Moreover, the polyimide/titania (PI/TiO2)
hybrid films without TMAC content (molar raito of p-BAPP: BTDA = 1: 1) are also prepared
through the same procedures.
2.3. Measurements
Fourier transfer infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR) absorption spectra are recorded by Nicolet
PROTEGE-460. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) study is carried out with a TESCAN
5136LS focusing on the fractured surfaces of nanocomposite films. Transmission electron
microscope (TEM) data is obtained by JEOL-2000FX. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is
performed with a Du Pont TGA-Q500. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is carried out by
means of thermal analyzer DMA- 2980. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) is obtained by
using a VG ESCA scientific theta probe spectrometer working in the constant analyzer energy mode
with a pass energy of 280 eV and Al Kα(1486.6eV) radiation as the excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
The PAI/TiO2 and PI/TiO2 nanocomposite films are obtained by using the sol-gel process. The
the hydrogen bonding between PAI and TiO2 increased, while the hydrogen bonding between PAI
and PAI decreased after the addition of TiO2. By the way, the rotation of amide component, CONH
single bond structure, will be increased and then the storage modulus and Tg of XT-PAI films are
lower than those of XT-PI films possessed.
The chemical compositions of X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) of 2.81T-PAI and
2.81T-PI nanocomposite films are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that 2.81T-PAI and 2.81T-PI
hybrid films contain the compound of Ti 2p1/2 of TiO2 (464.9 eV) on the hybrid film surface [16],
while the surface of 2.81T-PAI hybrid film for the TiO2 composite content is more than that of the
2.81T-PI hybrid film. On the other hand, the XPS is a useful technique to monitor polymer-polymer
interaction of nitrogen-containing polymers [17-21]. When the nitrogen atom is involved in
hydrogen-bonding interaction, the binding energy of the N1s electron is increased by about 1.0 eV
[21]. Fig. 7 shows the XPS spectra of the N1s binding energy of 2.81T-PAI and 2.81T-PI hybrid
films. The N1s spectra of 2.81T-PAI and 2.81T-PI show peak locating at 407.8 eV and 406.7,
respectively. This phenomenon is because the addition of TMAC will cause an increase of TiO2
content on film’s surface of 8.12T-PAI. This may be the hydrogen bond structure between amide
ground -NH and Ti-OH group of uncompletely condensation between TiO2. It is implied that the
migration of TiO2 species from the bulk to the surface of the 2.81T-PAI is observed.
4. Conclusion
Poly(amide-imide)/titania (PAI/TiO2) and polyimide/titania (PI/TiO2) nanocomposite films are
synthesized by sol-gel technology. The TMAC is added to the synthesis of poly(amide-imide)/TiO2
films for the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding that will influence the surface
characteristics, morphology and mechanical properties. The result indicates that as the TMAC
containing, the flexibility and toughness of the 8.12T-PAI nanocomposite film is formed and the
TiO2 is well-dispersed within PAI matrix. Due to the XPS analysis, the TiO2 content on the surface
of 2.81T-PAI is higher than that of 2.81-PI nanocomposite film. The PAI/TiO2 and PI/TiO2
nanocomposite films with higher titania content exhibits higher glass transition temperature (Tg)
and storage modulus than pure PAI and PI. Although the thermal stability of the nanocomposite
films are decreased by introducing TiO2, but the nanocomposite films still reveal pretty good
thermal resistance.
