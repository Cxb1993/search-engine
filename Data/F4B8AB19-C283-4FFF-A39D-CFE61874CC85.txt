Introduction 
Recently developed adaptive X  charts have been shown to give substantially faster detection 
of most process shifts than the fixed parameters (FP) X  chart. The first adaptive X  control chart 
is based on varying the sampling interval. Variable sampling interval (VSI) X  control chart was 
investigated by Reynolds et al. (1988), Runger and Pignatiello (1991), and Reynolds (1996a, b). 
Another set of studies focuses on varying the sample size. Variable sample size (VSS) X  control 
chart was investigated by Prabhu et al. (1993), Costa (1994), and Zimmer et al. (1998). Combined 
variable sample size and sampling interval X  control chart has also been developed and studied. 
Variable sampling rate (VSR) (VSR is also called the variable sample size and sampling intervals 
(VSSI)) X  control chart was investigated by Prabhu et al. (1994), Costa (1997, 1999a), and 
Zimmer et al. (2000). Finally, the idea of changing all control parameters (i.e., sampling interval, 
sample size, and control limit coefficient) on a combined adaptive control chart has been considered 
and studied. Variable parameters (VP) control chart was investigated by Costa (1998, 1999b), and 
Lin and Chou (2005). Tagaras (1998) gave a general survey of developments in the design of 
adaptive control charts. 
A fundamental assumption in the typical application of control charts is that the observations 
from the process at different time points are independent. However, this assumption may not be 
tenable in some production processes, e.g. the continuous chemical processes. The presence of 
autocorrelation in the process data can result in significant effect on the false alarm and detection 
ability. Reynolds et al. (1996) presented that autocorrelation is a significant problem for a VSI chart, 
because some of the observations are taken using a relatively short sampling interval. They 
provided a time series model, in which the observations are modeled as a first-order autoregressive 
(AR(1)) model plus a additional random error, to study the properties of the VSI and FP control 
charts. Lu and Reynolds (1999 and 2001) also evaluated the statistical performance of exponentially 
weighed moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts for an autocorrelation 
process using the same model. 
coefficient ( *2k ) are used if the prior sample point fallen in the warning region (i.e., [LCLl, LWLl] or 
[UWLl, UCLl], l=1,2). The process is out of control or has occurred a false alarm if the sample point 
falls in the action region (i.e., (–∞, LCLl) or (UCLl, ∞), l=1,2). 
When *1k =
*
2k , the VP X  chart is reduced to a VSR X  chart. For the case 
*
1k =
*
2k  and 
*
1n =
*
2n , the VP X  chart is identical to a VSI X  chart. For the case 
*
1k =
*
2k  and 
*
1h =
*
2h , the VP 
X  chart is identical to a VSS X  chart. When *1k =
*
2k , 
*
1n =
*
2n  and 
*
1h =
*
2h , the VP X  chart is 
a FP X  chart. 
 
Performance indicators 
Traditionally, average run length (ARL), which is defined as the average number of samples 
before the control chart signals an out-of-control condition, is applied to evaluate the performance 
of a control chart. However, when the sampling interval and sample size are variable, the time to 
signal and the observations to signal are not a constant multiple of ARL, and thus ARL is 
inappropriate for evaluating the effectiveness of the adaptive charts. The widely used statistical 
performance indicators for adaptive control charts include: ANOS (average number of observations 
to signal), in-control ATS (average time to signal) and out-of-control AATS (adjusted average time 
to signal). ANOS is defined as the expected number of individual observations from the start of the 
process to the time when the chart indicates an out-of-control signal. ATS is defined as the expected 
value of the time from the start of the process to the time when the chart indicates an out-of-control 
signal. AATS is defined as the expected value of the time from the occurrence of an assignable 
cause to the time when the chart indicates an out-of-control signal. 
A chart with a smaller ANOS indicates the lower sampling costs and observations than the 
other charts. When the process is in control, in-control ATS may be used to develop the measure of 
the false alarm rate for a chart. A chart with a larger in-control ATS indicates a lower false alarm 
rate. When the process is out of control, out-of-control AATS may be used to measure the 
performance of a chart. A chart with a smaller out-of-control AATS indicates the better detection
