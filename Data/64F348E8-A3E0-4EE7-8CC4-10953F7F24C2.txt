ABSTRACT 
In this report, the topics had been changed into〝The Endochronic Viscoplasticity 
For Sn/3.9Ag/0.6Cu Solder Under Low Strain Rate Fatigue Loading Coupled with 
Thermal Cycling.〞In this paper a wide range of temp. dependent kernel function ( )Zρ
and the strain-rate function ( , )h Tξɺ in the Endochronic viscoplasticity were 
established first by using experimental steady hysteresis loops of Wei et.al for 
Sn/3.9Ag/0.6Cu Solder at fixed 298K or 373K and strain rate at 
-3 -410 ,10 and -510 1/s; 
and then extended to predict the thermomechanical behavior of solder under constant 
low strain rate (
-510 1/s), from 0 to 1％ max. strain fatigue loading with in-phase 
thermal cycling between 298K and 373K. 
A novel approach in the theory to account for the microstructural changes 
enhanced by the stress-assisted grain boundary diffusion mechanism during thermal 
cycling was proposed by using a partial relaxation function 1( )h T of back stress (i.e. 
0 ( )in Zρ ρ ). The theoretical results were in very well agreement with experimental 
data. These results and the out-phase results from the present theory were new and 
might be used as references to compare with results derived from other theories.

2. Brief review of the endochronic viscoplasticity for thermomechanical 
behavior 
In the constitutive modeling of the endochronic viscoplasticity for 
thermomechanical behavior [8], the intrinsic time measure dξ is based on the norm of 
incremental deviatoric inelastic strain

here the metric measure is a material property which contains a temperature 
dependent material parameter ( )k T  and a temp. and relative strain rate sensitive 
material function ( , )h Tξɺ . The relative strain rate is defined as refξ ξ ξ≡ɺ ɺ ɺ  and at 
reference strain rate , ( , ) 1.0ref refh Tξ ξ ≡ɺ ɺ . The intrinsic time scale dZ  is defined as 
( , )dZ d f Tξ ξ=  (2) 
here ( , )f Tξ  is a material function to account for hardening/softening/steady 
behavior of loading history. Under steady behavior, ( , )f Tξ  becomes a constant, say 
0 ( )f T . Combining eqs.(1) and (2) and taking 0( ) ( ) 1.0k T f T = , one can redefine 
dZ for steady behavior ,i.e.

temp.(298K) and 100℃(373K) were shown in Figs.1 and 2. 
    According to Valanis and Lee [9], the kernel function ρ(Z) at constant temp. and 
strain rate cyclic strain condition, can be determined by the cyclically stable stress vs. 
strain response i.e. hysteresis loop. Following the procedures developed in ref. [3,10], 
the reference strain rate refεɺ was chosen at 10
-3
 1/s hence 0 1h ≡ for all temperature of 
interested. Choosing the lowest strain and stress point in the hysteresis loop, the 
eqs.(9a,b,c) with any even number of n can be read as

From Fig.3, 0.81α = , 0 5.9MPaρ =  at 298K. By using the same method for 373K 
in Fig.2, 0.88α =  and 0 1.4MPaρ = . 
   Based on the results of 0ρ  and α  at 298K and 373K, the functional forms of 
( )Tρ and ( )Tα between 298K and 373K must be established from the fundamental 
formulation of the endochronic theory. According to ref. [11], ρ(Z) is a mathematical 
representation of the combination of effects of many various sized Mises yield 
surfaces with linear kinematic hardening rule. 0ρ andα can be interpreted as the 
strength of back stress and the rate of dislocation generation and mobility respectively. 
As a result, the mathematical form of ( )Tα can be constructed by using the Arrhenius 
type rate equation, i.e.

values of Z∆ must be greater than *lowerZ for numerical accuracy and stability. Also, as 
shown in ref. [3] all values of rα ( 1,2, , )r n= ⋯ must keep the same within the 
temperature range of interest. In this paper, ( )Zρ at 373K was approximated first, for

As indicated in Fig.6, employing the least square method , all values of rα and 
rC were correlated in terms of r by the following equations： 
76 10 exp( 2.0194 )r rα = × −  (20a) 
72 10 exp( 1.7326 )rC r= × −  (20b) 
As shown in Fig.7, the above approximations agreed very well with the values of 
( )Zρ within the range from 710− to 210− .  
By fixing the values of rα for all temperature, the same procedures to determine 
the values of rC for T at 298K, 318K and 343K were used. Their approximated 
results were in very well agreement with the value of ( )Zρ , as shown in Figs.8a~8c. 
Based on the value of rC at these four temperature, the least square method was 
employed to construct the functional form of ( )rC T , i.e. 
7
0( ) 2 10 exp[ ( ) ]r h hC T C T r= × ×  (21a) 
and, as shown in Fig.8d,

210 1ξ− ≤ <ɺ , ( ) 0.04520h ξ ξ=ɺ ɺ                         (25) 
Since no further data were available below 2ξ −ɺ  and 1ξ >ɺ , the above equation are 
tentative and only be useful in the present paper. 
By the same procedures, 0 ( )h ξɺ  at 373K determined by Fig.2, were 0.860 for 
110ξ −=ɺ  and 0.778 for 210ξ −=ɺ . As shown in Fig.10, a power form relation similar 
to eq. (25) could be construct but with a little higher value of exponent. 
 
6.  The incremental equations of endochronic viscoplasticity under uniaxilly 
thermomechanical loading. 
    The tensor formulation of the incremental constitutive equations of the 
endochronic viscoplasticity under thermomechanical loading by using the 
approximated exponential functions of ( )Zρ  in the eq.(5a), had been presented in a 
series of papers published in journals [3,4]. Under the condition of uniaxilly 
thermomechanical loading, i.e. given ε∆ and ∆ T, the correspondent constitutive 
equations can be written in the following form : At the thm  step, given ( )mε∆ and

strain hysteresis loop was shown in Fig.13. 
    In this paper, eqs.(26~27e) and eq.(29) were employed to compute the stable 
stress-strain hysteresis loop. The temp. dependent material parameters ( ),r rCα  were 
given by eqs.(20a,21a), ( )hK T  and ( )E T  were given by eqs.(16,17). From ref.[2], 
the values of ( )T CTEα were computed by the equation of ( )16.66 0.017T ppm K+ . 
Here the authors took an average value of 22 ( )ppm K  for Tα  in the computation. 
Since the variations in the values of 0 ( , )h Tξɺ  at 
210ξ −=ɺ  and [ ]298,373T ∈  were 
small, as shown in Fig.10, the authors proposed a linear interpolation function of 
0 ( )h T  in the computation, see Fig.14, i.e. 
 0 ( ) / 0.812 0.1664( / 298) 1.1664h T T= − +  (30) 
By given ( ) ( )42 10 , 1.5
m m
T Kε −∆ = × ∆ = , the computational results were shown in 
Fig.13. Obviously, these results were not in good agreement with the experimental 
data, in particular within the range of lower temperature. 
 From section 3, it was known that the fatigue specimen were machined from  
casting plates first and then annealed 24hr at 100℃. Based on the information 
provided by ref.[1] for 95.5Sn/4.0Ag/0.5Cu solder, the temp. range of thermal cycling 
in the present case may enhance a stress-assisted grain boundary diffusion mechanism 
due to low strain rate and high temp. fatigue loading. Accelerated coarsening and then 
dynamic recrystallization of Snβ −  matrix result in an increase of the density of 
grain boundary, meanwhile 3Ag Sn  and 6 6Cu Snη −  phases are coarsening along the 
grain boundaries. These microstructural evolutions may relax the strength of back 
stress (i.e. 0ρ  in the present constitutive model). In Fig.15, the computational results 
were based on a fully relaxation of 0ρ  to the fixed value of 1.4MPa at 373K during 
the thermal cycling. The results showed over relaxation within the range of lower 
temperature. From both figures 13 and 15, stress responses around 373K were in good 
agreement with experimental data, these showed no need for 0ρ  relaxation. 
However, 0ρ  relaxation were the largest around 298K. Hence, the authors took the 
ratio of stress between the data and the computation result in Fig.13 at 298K, as the 
max. amount of relaxation(about 0.7), and proposed an Arrhenius type equation for 
the corresponding stress-assisted diffusion mechanism. As a consequency, a partial 
relaxation function 1( )h T  of 0 ( )Tρ  can be constructed, as shown in Fig.16, i.e. 
 0 in thermal cycling 1 0 isothermal at T( ) | ( ) ( ) |T h T Tρ ρ= ∗  (31a)
