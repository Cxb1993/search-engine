二、英文摘要 
An interesting Pd-AlGaN/GaN Schottky 
diode-type hydrogen sensor with ultrahigh 
sensing responses is fabricated and studied. A 
sensing response (SF) of 2.04×105 and a 
widespread Schottky barrier height variation of 
400 meV are observed upon exposure to a 9660 
ppm H2/air gas at 150oC. The high sensing 
response can be attributed to the catalytic 
capability of Pd metal with contributions from 
a high-density two-dimensional electron gas 
(2DEG) induced from spontaneous and 
piezoelectric polarizations. From a Langmiur 
isotherm, the equilibrium constants are found to 
be 1.9 and 0.7 torr-1 at 150 and 200oC, 
respectively. The fast response and recovery 
times (＜10s) are found under a 9660 ppm 
H2/air gas. Consequently, the compatible 
process of the AlGaN/GaN sensor makes it 
possible to be integrated into other 
high-sensing performance sensor for 
micro-electrical and mechanical (MEM) 
applications. 
 
Keywords: catalytic metal, AlGaN, hydrogen,

三、計劃緣由與目的 
Various chemical sensors have been 
fabricated for monitoring chemical gases and 
ions [1]-[3]. Among those, sensors related to 
hydrogen detection have attracted considerable 
attention. This is mainly due to the expected 
replacement of hydrogen energy to fossil oil. 
Hydrogen is contained in nature and considered 
as a clean energy source [4]. However, 
hydrogen gas is flammable and explosive. The 
   3 
 
(20 nm) and Al (100 nm) metals in sequence. 
Furthermore, samples were placed into the 
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) system at 900oC 
for 300 s in N2 ambience to form good Ohmic 
contacts. The Pd Schottky contacts were 
deposited by the thermal evaporation. The area 
and thickness of Schottky contacts were 
2.05×10-3 cm2 and 30 nm, respectively. The 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) analyses on 
the Schottky area were performed before and 
after hydrogen testing. Figures 2 (a) and 2 (b) 
show the sputter AES depth profile and SEM 
analyses of the Schottky contact area before 
testing, respectively. The oxygen signal at the 
Pd/AlGaN interface was almost negligible. 
Moreover, the SEM analysis reveals the dense 
film structure of Pd metal. The completed 
device was put into a stainless-steel chamber. 
In order to study the temperature-dependent 
characteristics, hydrogen concentrations of 15.2, 
99.4, 494, 1010, and 9660 ppm with air mixture 
as a carrier gas were introduced into the 
chamber. The electrical properties of the 
studied device were measured by an HP 4155 
semiconductor parameter analyzer. The current 
variations in response to various hydrogen 
concentrations were measured by an 
electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments Ltd). 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
Figure 3 illustrates the current-voltage 
(I-V) characteristics of the studied device upon 
exposure to various hydrogen gases, at 50, 150, 
and 200oC, respectively. All I-V curves show 
significant current variations in response to 
various hydrogen concentrations in air. The 
studied device also exhibits a low detection 
limit of hydrogen concentration (15.2 ppm 
H2/air). The hydrogen sensing mechanism can 
be briefly interpreted as follows. When 
hydrogen-containing gas flows through the 
sensing device, hydrogen molecules collide 
with the catalytic Pd metal surface. 
Subsequently, hydrogen molecules are 
dissociated into hydrogen atoms, and, then, 
diffuse through the bulk or the grain boundaries 
of Pd metal, and accumulate at the 
metal-semiconductor (M-S) interface. Those 
trapped hydrogen atoms are polarized by the 
built-in electric field of Schottky diode so as to 
form a dipole layer near the M-S interface. This 
dipole layer causes a substantial lowering of 
effective Schottky barrier height [6]. It leads to 
the remarkable increase of steady-state current 
as shown in Fig. 3. 
Figure 4 illustrates the sensing response 
under varied hydrogen-air mixture gases at the 
temperature range of 50-350oC. The inset 
displays the corresponding enlarged view. The 
sensing response (SF) is defined as:  
                       
2H air
F
air
I I
S
I
      (1) 
where Iair  and IH2  denote the currents 
measured in air and hydrogen-containing gas, 
respectively. Experimentally, a maximum 
sensing response can be obtained under the 
forward bias of Vappl=0.3 V when introducing a 
9660 ppm H2/air gas. When the temperature 
elevated to 150oC, a maximum SF of 2.04×105 
is obtained. As increasing the temperature to 
350oC, the SF shows the negative temperature 
dependence. This ultrahigh sensing response 
value (SF=2.04×105) is significantly higher than 
those obtained from some of the previously 
reported semiconductor-based hydrogen 
sensors [22], [23]. The studied device with the 
state-of-the-art may be primarily attributed to 
the use of Pd catalytic metal with contributions 
from high-density 2DEG from piezoelectric 
and spontaneous polarizations of the AlGaN 
layer. Increasing the temperature under lower 
temperature environment (T<150oC) can 
enhance the effective dissociation of hydrogen 
molecules, leading to a higher sensing response 
SF.  
Figure 5 shows the Schottky barrier height 
variation versus logarithmic value of hydrogen 
concentration at 50, 150, and 200oC. The inset 
illustrates the corresponding characteristics of

the Pd surface, K1 the equilibrium constant, c1 
and d1 the rate constants for forward and 
reverse reactions, respectively. Then hydrogen 
atoms adsorbed on the surface adsorption sites 
diffuse through the Pd metal bulk or grain 
boundary until reaching the Pd/AlGaN 
interface:

where Si denotes the hydrogen adsorption 
site at Pd/AlGaN interface, c2 and d2 represent 
the rate constants for forward and reverse 
reactions, respectively, and K2 is the 
equilibrium constant. The hydrogen adsorption 
and desorption rates at interface are equal when 
the previous reaction reaches steady state. By 
combining Eqs. (3) and (4):

where c3 and d3 are the rate constants for 
forward and reverse reactions, respectively. 
From the Langmuir isotherm equation [27], the 
relationship between the coverage of hydrogen 
at the interface θi and hydrogen partial 
pressures PH2 can be expressed as:

where θi is the coverage of hydrogen at the 
Pd/AlGaN interface which varies from 0 to 1, 
and K3 represents the equilibrium constant. 
The hydrogen atoms adsorbed at the 
Pd/AlGaN interface are polarized by the 
built-in electric field and form a dipole layer at 
the interface [6]. This dipole layer certainly 
causes a Schottky barrier height variation. The   
can be considered as proportion to the 
hydrogen coverage θi:

where 
maxB
  is the maximum change of 
Schottky barrier height variation. 
By combining Eqs. (6) and (7) the 
Langmuir-type equation can be rewritten as:

where Io is the saturation current in air, Iog 
the saturation current upon exposure to 
hydrogen gas, and Iog,max the saturation current 
under saturated adsorption status. Figure 8 
depicts the inverse logarithmic value of the 
ratio between the saturation current in air and 
saturation current upon hydrogen exposure 
(1/lnIog /Io), as a function of inverse square root 
of hydrogen partial pressure at 150 and 200oC. 
The equilibrium constant (K3) and Iog,max can be 
extracted from Fig. 7. The obtained K3 values 
are 1.9 and 0.7 torr-1/2 at 150 and 200oC, 
respectively. The previous results suggest that 
the equilibrium constant (K3) is 
temperature-dependant. According to Eq. (6), 
the decrease of K3 implies that fewer hydrogen 
atoms are adsorbed at the Pd/AlGaN interface 
with increasing the operating temperature.  
Figure 9 illustrates the transient responses 
under the introduction (ON) and removal (OFF) 
of 99.4, 494, and 1010 ppm H2/air gases, 
respectively, at 150oC. The insets show the 
transient responses under the hydrogen 
concentrations of 15.2 and 9660 ppm in air. 
The applied bias is maintained at 0.35 V. Figure 
8 reveals that the current response increases 
with increasing the hydrogen concentration. In 
this work, response and recovery times refer to 
the time deemed necessary to reach the 63% of 
the steady-state current from the original levels. 
The response (recovery) time is 220 (21), 101 
(8), 38 (9), 19 (5), and 7 (6) upon exposure to 
15.2, 99.4, 494, 1010, 9660 ppm H2/air gases, 
respectively. Clearly, response time displays a 
strong dependence on the hydrogen 
concentration. Response time drops remarkably 
   7 
 
explanation to the result is that the donor-like 
hydrogen atoms at the Pd/AlGaN interface 
donate the electrons to the bulk of AlGaN. With 
further increasing the hydrogen concentration, 
however, the series resistance Rs appears to be 
less affected by the hydrogen adsorption effect. 
六、結論 
In summary, an interesting 
Pd-AlGaN/GaN Schottky diode-type hydrogen 
sensor is fabricated and studied. The studied 
device exhibits a low detecting limit (≦ 15.2 
ppm H2/air), a fast response time (<10 s), and 
an ultrahigh sensing response (SF= 2.04×105). 
This high sensing response is mainly due to the 
catalytic capability of Pd film with 
contributions from a high-density 2DEG 
induced from the spontaneous and piezoelectric 
polarizations of the AlGaN/GaN structure. In 
addition, the changes of sensing responses 
varied with temperature are affected by the 
phase change in Pd film. Increasing the 
temperature from 50 to 150oC in air can largely 
increase the Schottky barrier height   from 
960 to 1280 meV. The abnormal phenomenon 
can be attributed to the barrier inhomogeneity. 
However, the increased   can supply the 
Schottky diode with a widespread modulation 
of Schottky barrier height variation  (400 meV 
at 150oC). Moreover, the equilibrium constants 
(K3) are found to be 1.9 and 0.7 torr-1/2 at 150 
and 200oC, respectively. The response 
(recovery) time varies from 220 (21) to 7(6) s 
as the hydrogen concentration is increased from 
15.2 to 9660 ppm H2/air at 150oC. 
Consequently, the compatible process of the 
AlGaN/GaN sensor makes it possible to be 
integrated into other high-performance sensor 
for micro-electrical and mechanical system 
(MEMS).

been widely applied in the fields of chemical 
plants, fuel cells, and semiconductor process [4,

gases ( ≧ 4.65%) are inflammable and 
explosive [6]. With the increasing necessity of 
hydrogen energy, the safety has become an 
important issue. Therefore, a small, low cost, 
reliable and fast response hydrogen sensor is 
indispensable for hydrogen applications. 
Hydrogen sensors based on metal-oxide and Si 
structures were extensively investigated [7, 8]. 
However, those sensors are constrained on the 
operation in harsh environments. Recently, 
III-N based materials have been developed for 
the applications of hydrogen sensors [9, 10]. In 
addition, GaN- and SiC-based sensors have 
been demonstrated good performance on the 
high-temperature durability [9-12]. Although 
SiC-based sensors exhibit the advantages of 
high thermal conductivity and resistance to 
corrosive environments, the relatively high cost 
of SiC material is a remarkable drawback in 
commercial point of view. On the contrary, 
GaN-based material has been widely used in 
the optoelectrical, high-speed electron devices 
and usually found in commercial markets due 
to its inherent properties of direct bandgap, 
high saturation velocity and high-temperature 
durability [13]. Therefore, GaN-based sensors 
exhibit the benefit of small size, low-cost, and 
reliable operations. AlGaN/GaN heterostructure 
has also drawn much attention due to a high 
density of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) 
[14, 15]. This property gives the promise for 
high-power and high-temperature microwave 
applications. Moreover, a high density of 
2DEG is beneficial to the sensitivity of surface 
condition and thus can be used to improve the 
hydrogen sensing capability [16]. Recently, on 
the other hand, the SiO2 passivation has been 
employed in the AlGaN/GaN high electron 
mobility transistor (HEMT) [17, 18]. 
Experimental results indicate that the SiO2 
passivation effectively improved the device 
performance such as cutoff frequency and 
breakdown voltage. However, the report related 
to the effect of SiO2 passivation on the 
AlGaN-based Schottky diode-type hydrogen 
sensor has not been found. 
In this work, an interesting hydrogen 
sensing device, Pd/AlGaN-based Schottky 
diode with the SiO2 passivation, is first 
fabricated and investigated. The Schottky diode 
parameters such as Schottky barrier height and 
Richardson’s constant in response to hydrogen 
gases at different temperatures are presented. In 
addition, the hydrogen adsorption kinetics 
analyses of the proposed device are also studied. 
It is known that, from experimental results, the 
hydrogen sensing performance includes sensing 
response and adsorption rate is substantially 
enhanced with the insertion of a thin SiO2 layer 
at the Pd-AlGaN metal-semiconductor interface. 
The employment of AlGaN/GaN 
heterostructure shows the promise for the 
multi-function devices such as light emitting 
diodes (LEDs), microwave transistors, and 
sensor arrays on a chip. 
 
四、研究方法 
Figure 1 illustrates schematic cross section 
of the proposed device. A metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system 
was employed to grow the desired epitaxial 
layers on a 2-inch c-plane sapphire substrate.

where A is the Schottky contact area, A* the 
effective Richardson constant (A*= 33.74 
Acm-2K-2) [22], and    the zero-bias Schottky 
barrier height.  
Figure 3 displays the Schottky barrier 
height variations     of the studied MOS and 
MS diodes at 30oC. The inset reveals the 
related Schottky barrier height  . While the 
hydrogen concentration is increased, the 
difference of the Schottky barrier height 
variation    between the two devices becomes 
prominent. The Schottky barrier height   of 
the MOS (MS) diode is decreased from 0.98 
(0.88) to 0.75 (0.68) eV under exposure to a 
1% H2/air gas. The lowering of Schottky 
barrier height is 230 (200) meV for the 
MOS(MS) diode. The wider-range Schottky 
barrier height modulation of the MOS diode 
could be mainly attributed to the presence of 
the SiO2 layer. This dielectric layer of MOS 
diode provides more adsorption sites for 
hydrogen atoms. The additional adsorption 
sites are supplied by the bonds to the interfacial 
metal-oxide layer between the metal and 
semiconductor [23]. Therefore, more hydrogen 
dipoles can be produced at the Pd/SiO2 
interface, and wider-range of Schottky barrier 
height variation is obtained.  
The Richardson constant of the proposed 
device can be obtained by using Eq. 3. Figure 4 
illustrates the Richardson’s constant plots at air, 
500, and 5000 ppm H2/air gases. The 
Richardson’s constant is substantially lower 
than the previously reported value (33.74 
Acm-2K-2) [22]. The low Richardson’s constant 
may be resulted from the inhomogeneity of 
Schottky barrier [24]. Surface defect such as 
nitrogen vacancies in the AlGaN leads to the 
barrier inhomogeneity. Some works indicated 
that the SiO2, which is deposited by PECVD, 
could also cause the surface defect in AlGaN 
layer [25]. Moreover, the Richardson’s plots 
also depict linear relationships between ln(Js/T2) 
and 1000/T under exposure to the 500, 5000 
ppm H2/air gases. The evaluated Richardson’s 
constants of the proposed device in air, 500, 
and 5000 ppm H2/air gases are 5.9×10-9, 3×10-7, 
and 1.9×10-4 Acm-2K-2, respectively. Obviously, 
the Richardson’s constant increases with 
increasing the hydrogen concentration. 
Generally, the Richardson’s constant can be 
expressed as: 
                                
     (4) 
 
where the h represents the Planck’s constant 
and    denotes the effective mass of electrons. 
The increase in effective Richardson’s constant 
A* with an increase in hydrogen concentration 
can be largely owing to the modulation of 
effective mass of electron in AlGaN which is 
affected by the hydrogen dipole. Yet, the 
detailed mechanism of the modulation of 
electron effective mass is not clear. Moreover, 
the Richardson’s constant is still much lower 
than the reported value 33.74 Acm-2K-2 even 
with exposure to the hydrogen gases. This 
observation interprets that hydrogen dipoles 
which are polarized by internal electric field 
can temporarily passivate the surface defect, 
but can not passivate throughout the whole 
AlGaN surface. Besides, the slopes of the plots 
in Fig. 4 reveal that the hydrogen dipole

surface, reducing the response time for the 
MOS diode. On the other hand, the diffusion 
phenomenon of Pd metal could possibly cause 
the increase in response time once the 
temperature is higher than 150oC. The Pd gate 
metal of the studied device that was operated at 
elevating temperatures can be considered as an 
annealing process. This leads to the change of 
morphology and diffusion of Pd. Thus, the 
sensing property including response time is 
also changed. The abnormal increase of 
response time is observed while the 
temperature is higher than 200oC. However, the 
temperature effect on the morphology of Pd 
film is complicated, especially under exposing 
to hydrogen gases. Therefore, further 
investigation on this issue should be performed 
in the future works. 
To investigate the influence of temperature 
on the hydrogen adsorption rate, the kinetic 
adsorption analyses are performed. The 
hydrogen adsorption process can be interpreted 
as follows [26]:  
First, hydrogen molecules are dissociated into 
atoms and subsequently adsorbed at the 
adsorption sites on Pd metal surface.

and measuring time t at different temperatures 
under 500, 1000, 5000 ppm H2/air gases. The 
linear relationship implies that the hydrogen 
adsorption rate is predominantly controlled by 
the hydrogen adsorption step [27]. The 
dependence of pressure-independent rate 
constant on temperature can be obtained by 
Arrhenius equation [28],

have drawn considerable attention because of 
its renewable resources without any 
contamination to the environment [1-2]. 
However, continuous monitoring of hydrogen 
gas is necessary for the hydrogen-based energy 
systems due to the safety consideration. It is 
known that, the active catalytic metal (e.g., Pt, 
Pd) can dissociate the hydrogen molecules into 
atoms [3]. Pd is widely used as the catalytic 
metal for sensing devices due to its outstanding 
catalytic capability [4] and mature deposition 
techniques (e.g., electroless plating and thermal 
evaporation) [5, 6].  
The surface morphology of catalytic metal 
film can substantially affect the hydrogen 
sensing performance. Therefore, various 
porous-based techniques to develop the specific 
thin film morphology were reported [7-9]. 
However, the porous metal film has the 
reliability problem which could cause the 
degradation of the device performance after 
long-term operation [10]. Therefore, in order to 
maintain the sensing characteristics and 
reliability of hydrogen sensors, dense metal 
film is usually considered for the fabrication of 
sensing devices. Lundström et al. first 
fabricated and reported the MOS capacitor-type 
hydrogen sensor in 1975 [3]. Since then, the 
Si-based hydrogen sensors have been widely 
and comprehensively investigated [11-14].  
On the other hand, gas sensors based on III-V 
compound, such as Pt-InAlAs Scottky diode, 
have also been fabricated [15]. It is known that 
high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)-type 
hydrogen sensors present the advantages of 
large current variation, fast response, and the 
compatibility with conventional semiconductor 
fabrication process [16]. Previously reported 
FET-type sensors, including GaAs- and 
AlGaAs-HEMTs, demonstrated good sensing 
properties toward hydrogen gas [16, 17]. 
Although these hydrogen sensors exhibit good 
sensing performance, the electron mobility of 
those devices is not as high as those with high 
indium contents at the channel layer [18]. This 
limits the integration of high-performance 
sensors and high-frequency devices with the 
same epitaxial structure. Conventional 
InP-HEMT has the good point of high indium 
content of channel layer, which leads to high 
electron mobility at the channel layer. However, 
the fragile InP-substrate limits the substrate 
size to a small diameter [19]. On the other hand, 
the GaAs-HEMT has a larger substrate size as 
compared with the InP-HEMT. In order to 
integrate these good points into a HEMT, the 
metamorphic high electron mobility transistor 
was fabricated. The metamorphic buffer layer 
accommodates the lattice mismatch between 
the GaAs substrate and InGaAs channel layer 
[20]. Therefore, the epitaxial structure shows 
the merits of high electron mobility at channel 
and large substrate size.  
In this work, an interesting Pd/InAlAs 
metamorphic high electron mobility transistor 
(MHEMT)-based hydrogen sensor is fabricated 
and investigated. The employment of 
metamorphic buffer makes it feasible to 
fabricate an FET-type hydrogen sensor with 
high indium content on a GaAs substrate. The 
hydrogen sensing properties of the studied 
device such as threshold voltage, current 
variation, transient response, and sensing 
response are demonstrated. By combining the 
high-frequency operation of MHEMT with 
high-performance MHEMT-based sensor, the 
wide-range wireless sensor system on single 
chip is feasible.

where a2, b2 are the constants for forward and 
reverse reactions (hydrogen desorption), 
respectively, and Si the adsorption site at 
Pd/InAlAs interface. Then, the internal electric 
field-induced polarization causes formation of 
hydrogen induced dipole. The electric field of 
hydrogen atom dipole shows the opposite 
direction to the internal electric field. This 
leads to the lowering effect of Schottky barrier 
height, which modulates the energy band and 
the two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) 
density as shown in Figs. 4a and 4b [22]. 
Figures. 4a and 4b show the energy-band 
diagram of the studied device at air and 
hydrogen-containing atmosphere, respectively. 
Therefore, the corresponding current variation 
in response to hydrogen can be observed in 
Figs. 3a and 3b. 
 
Figure 5 illustrates the drain-current sensing 
response (SR) versus gate-source voltage VGS 
upon exposing to a 1% H2/air gas at 303 K. The 
drain-current sensing response SR is defined as: 
2, ,
,
D H D air
R
D air
I I
S
I

                     (3) 
where ID,H2 and ID,air are the drain currents in 
hydrogen-containing and air ambiance, 
respectively. Obviously, the SR is sensitive to 
the applied gate bias voltage. Under lower VGS 
(<-0.5 V), the SR vale is increased with 
increasing the VGS. The studied device exhibits 
the highest SR value of 107% at VGS=-0.5 V. 
With further increasing VGS, the SR value is 
decreased. While the gate bias VGS is kept at 
-1.2 V, which is smaller than the threshold 
voltage Vth in hydrogen containing ambiance 
(-1.05 V), the hydrogen dipole-induced 
electrons are hardly generated due to the 
presence of large magnitude of gate bias. By 
increasing the gate bias voltage, the 
dipole-induced electrons can contribute the 
magnitude of drain current transport because of 
the low magnitude of gate bias voltage. When 
the gate bias is larger than -0.5 V, the SR value 
becomes smaller. This can be attributed to the 
large drain current in air ambiance. However, a 
large current variation on the order of mA is 
obtained by increasing the gate bias larger than 
-0.5 V. On the other hand, the studied hydrogen 
sensor exhibits a relatively high sensing 
response and low current value at VGS= -0.5 V. 
Therefore, when considering the power 
consumption and high sensing response, the 
appropriate operation point of the studied 
hydrogen sensor can be selected at VGS= -0.5 V. 
Figure 6 shows drain current sensing response 
SR as a function of inverse temperature upon 
exposing to the hydrogen gases with different 
concentrations. The gate-source and 
drain-source voltages are kept at -0.5 V and 1.5 
V, respectively. The studied device exhibits 
good linearity between drain current sensing 
response and temperature. As can be seen from 
Fig. 6, SR is increased with increasing hydrogen 
concentrations. A highest SR of 107% can be 
   29 
 
molecules impinging on the catalytic Pd metal 
reacts with oxygen molecules to form the 
hydroxyl. Subsequently, the hydroxyl reacts 
with the hydrogen atoms to form water. 
Therefore, the decreasing current with time can 
be observed due to the formation of water. 
However, the amount of produced water is 
nearly found under exposing to 
low-concentration hydrogen gases. This 
explains that the abnormal current variation is 
not observed for the introduction of 50 ppm 
H2/air gas. In contrast, by increasing the 
hydrogen concentration, this phenomenon can 
be easily found. As shown in Fig. 5, the 
decreased magnitude of the drain current with 
time is 0.03, 0.1, and 0.1 mA for 0.02, 0.1, and 
0.5 H2/air, respectively. The magnitude of 
decreasing current reaches a saturated value 
(0.1 mA) with further increasing the hydrogen 
concentration. 
Figure 10 illustrates the response time (τa) as a 
function of inverse temperature (1000/K) under 
exposing to the different concentrations of 
hydrogen gases. The response time a is defined 
here as the time is needed for the current to 
reach 63% of the steady-state value from the 
drain current in air atmosphere. The response 
time τa is decreased with increasing the 
hydrogen concentration and temperature. The 
results are well consistent with previous report 
[17]. It is worth to note that the response time 
shows less dependence on the temperature as 
exposing to high-concentration hydrogen gases 
i.e., the temperature effect dominates the 
response time of the studied device as exposing 
to low-concentration hydrogen gases. The 
increase of temperature increases the hydrogen 
collision rate on the Pd surface, and thus 
decreases the response time [26]. According to 
Hertz-Knudsen equation, the temperature 
dependence of collision rate Rads shows a 
dependency on the inverse square root of 
temperature [27]. However, the observed 
dependencies are much stronger which implies 
that another mechanism is dominant. Generally, 
the adsorption rate Rads can be expressed as 
[28]: 
Rads= FS                           (5) 
where F is the flux rate of hydrogen gas and S 
the sticking coefficient. It is known that the 
sticking coefficient decreases with an increase 
in temperature [23]. Therefore, the less 
dependence of response time at high 
temperature may be also due to the decreased 
hydrogen sticking coefficient. On the other 
hand, the low dependence on temperature is 
mainly due to the mass transport of 
high-concentration hydrogen gases which flow 
into and out of the testing chamber [29]. 
It is known that the hydrogen response rate is 
dominantly determined by the hydrogen 
adsorption step [30]. Therefore, the hydrogen 
response rate can be represented by the 
hydrogen coverage at Pd/InAlAs interface [30]: 
,( )i r i eq
d k
dt
    
                   (6) 
where i  and ,i eq  are the hydrogen 
coverage at Pd/InAlAs interface at time t and at 
the equilibrium state, respectively, t the 
measuring time, kr the pressure dependent rate 
constant. It should be noted that the reverse 
reaction of hydrogen adsorption at the 
Pd/InAlAs interface (hydrogen desorption) is 
almost negligible in the initial adsorption of

Abstract—A GaN-based light emitting diode (LED) with an air-
buffer layer and textured sidewalls is fabricated and investigated. 
A hot KOH etching solution is used to etch samples for 5 min. to 
develop the desired textured sidewalls and air-buffer layer. At 20 
mA, as compared with the conventional LED, the studied device 
exhibits improved output power and external quantum efficiency 
(EQE) by 11.7 and 1.9 %, respectively. 
Introduction 
Recently, high-brightness GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
have attracted great interests for a number of applications such as large-
area outdoor display, exterior automotive lighting, traffic signals, and 
backlighting for cell-phones. However, due to the large difference of 
refractive indexes between GaN and air, the poor light extraction efficiency 
limits the total reflection angle (TRA) to be only 23.6° [1]. Thus the 
photons generated within multiple-quantum well (MQW) structure can not 
be collected effectively. It is known that the rough surface and textured 
sidewalls could be used to reduce the limitation of TRA based on the small 
periodicity of surface variation [2]. Moreover, rough sidewalls are 
relatively easy to form many escape cones as compared with smooth ones 
[3]. In this work, a simple method to roughen the device sidewalls is 
reported by using a conventional KOH wet-etching process without 
deteriorating the electrical properties.  
 
Results and discussion 
Lateral etching is usually formed at chemical-weak defect sites such as 
the juncture of protrudent sapphire and GaN epilayer, where chemical bonds 
may be relatively weaker due to the stress variation [4]. Hence, there are 
many ununiformly triangular-shaped cones exist on the patterned sapphire 
substrate (PSS), as shown in Fig. 1. The inset of Fig. 1 demonstrates the 
juncture of GaN and sapphire before (above) and after (below) KOH wet-
etching process. Clearly, the KOH etchant etches through GaN layer until 
the chemical-inert crystal surface is exposed which yields an air buffer layer 
between GaN epilayer and sapphire substrate.The TRA between GaN and 
the air is sin-1 (1/2.5) = 23.58°, which is smaller than the corresponding 
value of sin-1 (1.8/2.5) = 46° between GaN and sapphire. One can infer that 
photons emitting downward may experience multiple opportunities to reflect 
upward at the interface between epilayer and the air buffer layer due to the 
decreased TRA as well as the scattering effect induced by textured interface, 
as shown in Fig. 1. There are about 11.7 and 1.9 %enhancements in output 
power and external quantum efficiency. These improvements are mainly 
caused by the presences of textured sidewalls as well as the air buffer layer 
which substantially activate photons extraction from lateral and vertical 
sides of LED device [5] 
.

sidewalls after KOH wet-etching process. 
Conclusion  
A GaN-based LEDs with textured sidewalls and an air buffer layer is 
fabricated and studied. The sidewall wet-etching process is made by a hot 
(85°C) KOH etchant for 5 minutes. Experimentally, not only rough 
sidewalls but also the floating p-GaN with an air buffer layer are formed 
for the studied LED device. The studied device enhances photons 
extraction from lateral as well as vertical directions. The increases of EQE 
of 1.9 % and output power of 11.7 % are obtained, respectively.

-0.2V. All potentials were recorded relative to that of Ag/AgCl
reference.
As applying a proper working potential, the SAM molecule
(RS-) was desorbed from RS-Au and reduced into Au, expressed as
AuRSeAuRS   (1)
Based on the Faraday’s law, the peak area for the reductive
desorption represented the adsorption amount of SAM molecules
on the Au surface. The SAM coverage,, was then estimated by
using the following equation:
zF
Qd (2)
where Qd represented the reductive charge, F Faraday’s constant,
and z the number of transferring electrons.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Adsorption of SAMs on Au surface
Figure 2 illustrated cyclic voltammograms for the reductive
desorption of various carboxyl-terminated SAMs functionalized
gold electrodes. As reported previously [8], different reductive
potentials for the reaction in Eq. (1) were attributed from different
Au planes. Observed from Figure 2, there were two peaks
occurred in the reductive route: One (Peak 1) was located in the
lower potential range of -0.82 ~ -0.96 V, indicating a weaker
adsorption of RS- on the Au(111) surface; the other (Peak 2) was
in the higher potential range of -0.95 ~ -1.22 V, indicating a
stronger adsorption on Au steps or edges. Besides, as can be seen
in Figure 3, both positions of peaks and calculated reductive
charges were strongly dependent on the carbon number of SAMs.
With increasing the carbon number, the reductive potentials for
both Peak 1 and Peak 2 moved toward negative direction, and the
total reductive charges (Qd) became larger. Moreover, the
calculated Qd andvalues were consistently increased with
increasing the chain length of SAM. This inferred that the longer
chain SAM molecules adsorbed on the Au surface tended to
higher degree of ordering arrangement due to stronger van der
Waals interaction between molecules [9, 10]. Therefore, for the
SAM molecule with longer alkyl chain, higher potential was
needed for desorption; besides, more SAM molecules were
allowed to adsorb on the Au surface. This would result in
increases of SAM coverage and total reductive charge. In other
words, more adsorption sites could be offered by the SAM with
longer chain, which would be favorable to the ethanol vapor
sensing.
2. Steady-state ethanol vapor sensing
As shown in Figure 4, the SH(CH2)5-COOH modified
Au/GaAs Schottky diode demonstrated good rectifying property
in nitrogen ambience. In the presence of ethanol vapor, it was
found that the reverse currents were significantly increased with
increasing the ethanol vapor concentration. Obviously, the
variations in reverse currents were much larger than those in
forward currents, indicating the ethanol vapor detection was
preferably operated at reverse rather than at forward bias.
As mentioned above, the carbon number of alkanethiolates
played an important role on the adsorption amount and
arrangement of SAMs and thus it would determine the number of
available sensing sites. In order to compare current variations
among different devices and eliminated the effect of ethanol
vapor concentration, the sensitivity Sn was defined as the ratio of
current variation in ethanol vapor- containing mixture to the
current in nitrogen per unit ethanol vapor concentration at a given
bias, which was expressed as
EtOHN
NEtOH
n CI
III
S

where IEtOH represented the response current at ethanol vapor
-containing mixture, IN2 the current at nitrogen ambience, and
CEtOH the ethanol vapor concentration in the mixture.

The effect of carbon number of SAM molecules on the sensitivity
of device at 298K was shown in Figure 5. It revealed that, with
shorter chain length of alkanethiolates, e.g., n < 6, the sensitivity
modified by the SAM with n = 6. However, more efforts will be
made on further improving the sensitivity in the future work.

Abstract 
An InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diode (LED) with 
a ten-period i (undoped) -InGaN/p (Mg doped) -GaN (2.5 nm/5 nm) superlattice (SL) 
structure, is fabricated and investigated. This SL structure which could be regarded as 
a confinement layer of holes to enhance the hole injection efficiency, is inserted 
between MQW and p-GaN layers. The studied LED device exhibits better current 
spreading performance and an improved quality, compared with a conventional one 
without the SL structure. Due to the reduced contact resistance as well as more 
uniformity of carriers injection, the operation voltage at 20 mA is decreased from 3.32 
to 3.14 V. A remarkably reduced reverse-biased leakage current (10-7 to 10-9 A) and 
higher endurance of the reverse current pulse are found. The measured output power 
and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the studied LED are 13.6 mW and 24.8 %. 
In addition, significant enhancement of 25.4 % in output power as well as increment 
of 5 % in EQE for studied devices are observed, as they show superior current 
spreading ability and reduction in dislocations offered by the SL structure.  
 hole concentration on the topmost contact layer, the hole injection could be enhanced 
by confining high density of holes in the inserted SL layers neighboring MQW layers. 
Thus, the carrier injection efficiency in MQW is superior to those LED devices 
without the inserted SL structure. Moreover, different from the SL used for contact 
layer to reduce surface pits, the dislocation-induced traps, vacancies, deep-level states, 
strain, or leakage pathways in the p-GaN epilayer could be significantly diminished 
by using an inserted SL structure [14-15]. The diminishment of threading dislocations, 
propagating from the underlying epilayer to the p-GaN, could also be responsible for 
the modulation of the inserted SL.   
In this work, an inserted SL structure is applied as a hole confinement layer in 
InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs. A 10-period undoped InGaN/Mg-doped GaN (2.5 nm/5 nm) 
SL is inserted between MQW and p-GaN layers to serve as a current spreading layer 
as well as a dislocation filter. The p-GaN layers in SL act as confinement layers to 
cause the current to redistribute in the low-resistivity InGaN layers. By doing this, a 
more uniform hole injection is achieved. The thermal generation under n- and p- 
electrodes could be reduced significantly because less carrier locates nearby pads and 
spreads uniformly in whole epilayers. Hence, the parasitic effect could be reduced 
under forward bias operation [6]. In addition, due to the inserted SL, a near 
defect-free p-GaN epilayer can be expected.  
     
2. Experimental 
The studied LED with SL structure (denoted as device B) was grown by a 
Thomas Swan metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system on a 
c-plane (0001) oriented sapphire substrate. The epitaxial structures consisted of 30 nm 
GaN buffer layer, 2 μm-thick undoped GaN layer , 2 μm-thick Si-doped n-GaN layer 
 layers (with lower energy band gap) within SL can be designated as low-resistive 
conducting layers with many parallel resistors (Rp). Current can be injected widely 
through the whole InGaN layers. The GaN layers (with higher energy band gap) 
within SL can be regarded as series diodes (Ds) with higher turn-on voltages to block 
vertical injection of carriers, until the applied voltage is high enough to turn-on these 
Ds. The corresponding energy band diagram of the SL layers is shown in Fig. 1(b). 
Due to the piezoelectric field induced by GaN and In0.2Ga0.8N layers, the band 
bending phenomenon is observed. Holes tend to transport laterally in InGaN layers 
prior to the injection into GaN layers, until a higher voltage is applied. So, due to the 
band offset between GaN and InGaN layers, the injected carriers spread substantially 
widely for device B, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Obviously, because of the absence of this 
SL structure, current injection shows narrow spreading. Therefore, as compared with 
the device A, the device B exhibits better current spreading ability and a reduced 
parasitic effect when the operation voltage is increased. 
Figure 2 shows a TEM image of the device B near active regions. Distinct 
InGaN/GaN interfaces in MQW layers are observed. The thickness of GaN barrier 
layers are around 12 nm, which is thick enough to confine electron-hole pairs. 
Carriers transport is mainly caused by the thermionic emission. The thinner InGaN 
(around 5 nm) is a well layer to contribute the radiative recombination of carriers. 
Clearly, well-crystalline InGaN/GaN SL layers were grown above MQW. Comparable 
thickness between GaN confinement (5 nm) and InGaN channel (2.5 nm) layers are 
determined. The dominant carrier transport in SL is expected to be caused by 
diffusion along with the tunneling mechanisms. The former mechanism contributes a 
better current spreading uniformity while the latter one limits the operation voltage. 
Figure 3 shows the dynamic resistances of devices A and B as a function of 
 Figure 4 depicts the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) profile near the SL 
layers for the device B. The Cs+ ion source is used in this work. The 0 nm depth is 
represented as the location of p-GaN surface. Here, both SL and MQW layers are 
labeled in dashed lines. In SL region, the Mg concentration is higher than the nearby 
regions, indicating the doping process in GaN barrier layers is achieved. Clearly, due 
to the limited resolution of SIMS analysis, it is impossible to divide the 2.5-nm 
i-InGaN well from the 5-nm Mg-GaN barrier layers apart. On the other hand, the Mg 
doping concentration can still be determined to be around 4×1018 cm-3 by the SIMS 
data. Generally, the primary current transport by diffusion or tunneling mechanism in 
SL layers is decided by many factors. It is known that the hole concentration primarily 
determines the hole effective mass [17]. In addition, the thickness of GaN barrier 
layer in this work is around 5 nm, confirmed by TEM analyses in Fig. 2. Both the two 
important factors (hole effective mass and barrier thickness), which dominantly 
influence the tunneling probability [18], are poorer than those obtained from the 
previous SL tunneling layer [7]. Furthermore, if the piezoelectric field is taken into 
consideration, the 20% In composition induces a higher strain (as compared with that 
obtained in [7]). Hole carriers are confined in a more localized region in InGaN well 
layers (shown in the band diagram in Fig. 1(b)), resulting in a thicker barrier width. 
Due to these reasons, the current tunneling phenomenon is hence limited. 
Experimentally, Fig. 3 also agrees well with the prediction. The injected current is 
clearly suppressed when the applied forward voltage is lower than 2.0 volt. It could be 
attributed to the rather higher probability of current spreading than the possibility of 
current tunneling in the InGaN well layers. As a result, a superior current spreading 
performance is achieved, provided by the inserted SL layers.  
Based on AFM measurements, the values of surface root-mean square roughness 
 comparable with that of the previous report [6]. These values are extracted from the 
linear region of I-V characteristics and ranged from 1 to 2 (1.5 to 2.5). As compared 
with the device without SL layer, the quite different ideality factor could be attributed 
to the great difference in material qualities of devices. The high ideality factors 
(n>>2.0) in GaN-based LEDs are mainly attributed to deep-level-assisted tunneling. 
Ideality factors close to 2.0 are caused by the reduced recombination of holes into the 
defect states in the p-GaN layer, which is consistent with the Sah–Noyce–Shockley 
hypothesis [20]. Moreover, both the poorer Ohmic contact property and current 
spreading ability for the device A also lead to an increased ideality factor [6, 21]. 
Similar results were reported by Wang et al. [22]. The ESD characteristics of devices 
A and B are also measured and shown in Fig. 5(b). 1400 V reverse pulse voltages are 
continuously applied to the chips for 10 times of human body mode testing. For 
device A, after the ESD stress, a significant increase of the reverse current is observed. 
As compared with original values (in the order of 10-10 to 10-7 A), much higher 
leakage currents (in the order of 10-7 to 10-3 A) are generated for device A. On the 
other hand, due to the presence of the inserted SLs, the activation of leakage paths 
induced by the ESD stress is suppressed for device B. The device B can endure such a 
high pulse voltage without significant increase in the leakage current.     
Figure 6 illustrates the light output power as well as external quantum efficiency 
(EQE) as a function of operation current. At 20 mA, the output powers for devices A 
and B are 10.8 and 13.6 mW, respectively. Apparently, the device B exhibits 25.4% 
improvement on output power. The improvement is due to the more uniform 
distribution of injection carriers caused by the presence of SL structure [13]. In 
addition, the V-defects in the p-GaN layer of device A are found to be electronic 
activity [8]. They form nonradiative recombination centers. Based on the help of a 
 under a low injection level, the injection current is dominated by the term An which is 
related to nonradiative recombinations. The higher EQE of device B at a low injection 
level (<10 mA) can be ascribed to the smaller coefficient A induced by reduced 
defects in the p-GaN layer. Thus, the device B shows more pronounced radiative 
recombination over defect-induced nonradiative recombination, while device A does 
oppositely.  
 
Summary 
An interesting InGaN/GaN MQW LED with a 10-period i-InGaN/p-GaN (2.5 
nm/5 nm) SL structure is fabricated and studied. As compared with a conventional 
LED without the SL structure, the studied LED exhibits improved current spreading 
performance and a high-quality p-GaN layer. The turn-on voltage at 20 mA is 
decreased from 3.32 to 3.14 V due to the reduced contact resistance as well as the 
more uniformity of carriers injection. A substantially reduced leakage current for the 
studied device is also obtained. After the ESD testing (1400-V reverse voltage), the 
studied device exhibits only a small increase in leakage current, while the LED device 
without the SL structure shows a big increase. For the studied LED, the significant 
enhancement of 25.4 % in output power as well as the increment of 5 % in EQE are 
observed due to the superior current spreading ability and a better film quality 
produced by the presence of SL structure. In addition, these improvements are 
enhanced especially at a higher injection condition, based on the reduction of heat 
generation.

德期間，筆者赫然發現整整 4~5 天之行程，德國無論上自高速公路，下至鄉
間小道，竟然全都是平整順暢，這與我們所熟悉的台灣道路，幾乎每條都有
坑坑洞洞之事實，實在令人感慨萬千。 
建議： 
由於在諸如此類之重要國際發明展均能吸引全世界目光之聚焦，此等國
際場合並非只有台灣媒體，在會場處處可見國際媒體的存在。能代表學校在
此等場合參賽並奪獎，對於台灣在國際間的能見度相信必能重大之助益，其
效應當是無遠弗屆。因此，建請國科會對於相關報名參展費用以及學生個人
之旅費等能予以補助。另外，為了能讓研究與實用兼具，提升台灣聲譽，建
議國科會對於出席此類重要國際發明展之學生能建立制度性之補助機制，鼓
勵學生參展，以開拓國際視野，提高全台灣之能見度與地位。相信這對提昇
碩博士班學生出席國際發明展之成效會有更實質之幫助。
