Abstract 
This project is concerned with the design 
methodology of an adaptive sliding mode 
controller based on the Lyapunov stability 
theorem for a class of MIMO nonlinear 
mismatched perturbed systems to solve the 
robust output tracking problem. The main idea 
of this project is that we introduce two 
estimating schemes both in the proposed 
control scheme and the designed sliding 
function to control the effect caused by 
mismatched disturbances so that the states of 
system still can achieve the objective of 
asymptotical stability. An adaptive control 
mechanism, which is used to adapt the 
unknown upper-bounds of perturbation 
estimation error, is embedded in the proposed 
controller so that the knowledge of 
upper-bounds of perturbation as well as 
perturbation estimation error is not required.  
Keywords: mismatched perturbation, sliding 
mode control, adaptive control 
一、緣由與目的 
It is known that if mismatched perturbation 
exists, the desired tracking precision using 
conventional sliding mode control may in 
general not be always achieved and the 
property of asymptotical stability may not be 
guaranteed. When designing these control 
systems, most of researchers need to know the 
information of the upper-bound of perturbation 
[1-4]. Elmali and Olgac [5-7] proposed a 
control scheme in which a perturbation 
estimation scheme is embedded in the 
traditional SMC design. The main advantage 
of this methodology is that a priori knowledge 
of the upper-bounds of perturbation is not 
required. However, the upper-bounds of the 
perturbation estimation errors are still needed 
[5-7]. The main idea of this project is that we 
introduce two estimating schemes both in the 
proposed control scheme and the designed 
sliding function to control the effect caused by 
mismatched disturbances so that the states of 
system still can achieve the objective of 
asymptotical stability. The proposed robust 
tracking controller consists of three parts. The 
first part contains the measurable feedback 
signals. The second part, a switching 
mechanism, is used for enhancing the 
robustness of stability of the system. The last 
part is an adaptive control mechanism, which 
is used to adapt the unknown upper-bounds of 
perturbation estimation error, so that the 
knowledge of upper-bounds of perturbation as 
well as perturbation estimation error is not 
required. The advantages are that not only the 
stability of the overall controlled system can be 
guaranteed, but also the desired tracking 
accuracy can be achieved by adjusting the 
design parameters of the proposed controller.

It is noted that only 1,iz  in (7) is measurable. 
If we consider auxu  as input and 1,iz  as 
output, it can be easily verified that (7) is both 
controllable and observable. Because jiz , , 
inj ,,2 L=  are not measurable, and we need 
the information of these state variables to 
implement the sliding function (6), we 
construct an estimator of tracking error 
dynamics. Before constructing the estimator of 
dynamics of tracking error ie , we first 
construct an auxiliary estimator of 
ini
p ,∆ . 
Define [ ]Tniii i,1, ζζ L≡ζ  and [ ]Tniii ill ,1, L≡L . This auxiliary estimator 
is designed as 
( )1,1, iiiauxiiii z ζ−++= LubζAζ& . (8) 
Let iii ζzζ −= . Then from (7) and (8) it can 
be shown that

The preceding equation implies that 
( ) 1,,1,11,, ininininni iiiii lslslsp ζ++++=∆ −− L . (10) 
Hence, we can estimate 
ini
p ,∆  by using (10). 
However, due to the  complication of 
estimation of high order derivative and the 
possibility of enhancement of high frequency 
noise, we only estimate the zero and first order 
derivative of iζ . Therefore, inip ,∆  is 
estimated by

After designing the auxiliary estimator of 
ini
p ,∆ , we then construct an estimator of 
tracking errors' dynamics. Define [ ]Tniii izz ,1, ˆˆˆ L≡z . The estimator of tracking 
error's dynamics is designed as 
( ) ( )1,1,,, ˆˆˆ iiiestniauxiiii zzp i −+∆++= LubzAz&  (12) 
Now define iii zzz −≡ ˆ~ , then from (7) and 
(12), we can obtain 
( )estniniiiioi ii pp ,,,, ~~ ∆−∆+= bzAz& . (13) 
Since the eigenvalues of io,A  were on the 
LHP of complex plane by choosing an 
appropriate iL  in (9), iz~  is stable and 
bounded if estnini ii pp ,,, ∆−∆  is bounded (the 
boundness of estnini ii pp ,,, ∆−∆  will be shown 
later). It is clearly shown in (13) that the 
precision of the auxiliary estimator will affect 
the accuracy of estimating of tracking errors' 
dynamics. If estnini ii pp ,,, ∆=∆ , then 0~ →iz  
as ∞→t , which means that
