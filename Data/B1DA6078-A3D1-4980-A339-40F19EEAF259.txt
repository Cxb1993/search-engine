from water closet. The relevant regulations and testing standards are arranged as the 
reference of this research. The national standards including CNS 3220 and CNS 3221 
are current domestic regulations in Taiwan. The testing standard also includes ASME 
A112.19.6-1995 USA.  
Due to the complexity of main drain fitting, there is not yet limitation for the 
length of main drain in Taiwan’s Building Code so far. Even the NPC of USA and 
HASS of Japan have no regulation in this issue. Current building designs are getting 
huge and complex. More and more open space is set into ground floor to make the 
function be more flexible recently in Taiwan. Consequently, the main drain design has 
to be fitted more complex in detail and longer for deliver the solid to the treatment 
device. Those changes increase the resistance of transportation and the risk of failure of 
main drain. The increasing problems of main drain reflect the importance of this issue. 
Namely, the building code needs adequate tool to regulate the design of main drain in 
buildings.

Figure 1. Testing device in NTUST 
 
Experiment plan was set up for visual transportation phenomenon in main drain of 
buildings and clarifying its feature. The testing rigs are offered by ABRI (Architecture 
and Building Research Institute) and NTUST (National Taiwan University of Science 
and Technology). Transparent PVC pips were used for the observation on the 
transportation phenomenon in main drain of testing devices. The testing pipe is 18 
meters in ABRI and 50 meters in NTUST for multiple conditions of experiments. The 
The first point which is noticed as the transportation issue of main drain is the join 
connection from vertical stack to horizontal pipe. It is obviously that the solid delivery 
ability of main drain would be affected by the resistant of join connection. According to 
the investigation, there are single 90° join and double 45° join adopted in existing 
buildings, and very few cases use the special join in Taiwan. Therefore, the inference of 
join resistant needs to be clarified and confirmed. This study confirmed the effect of 
single 90° join and double 45° join by experiment to find the first parameter for 
transportation performance of main drain.  
According to the initial investigation of existing building main drain, this paper 
concludes the parameters which would affect the transportation performance. Besides 
the flash volume of water closet, the parameters include pipe diameter, slope, vertical 
elbow and horizontal bend. In order to clarify the inference of the main drain conditions 
and to build a estimating model, these parameters need to be validated by experiment. A 
series of testing procedure was set up to confirm the index of these parameters.  
Due to the existing building main drain condition is complex and the limitation of 
experiment device, this study try to consider the maximum possibility of drain 
compositions to simulate the real situation. Therefore, 16 groups of compositions are 
concluded to simulate all possibility of main drain fitting in existing buildings in this 
paper. Two sponge testing body was used as the imitated solid and 5 times of repeat 
testing were executed in experimental tower. Thus, 10 experimental data can be 
recorded in each testing composition.

Consequently, each parameter compares to the criterion condition, the relative 
inference to solid transportation can be conversed quantitative index of distance. The 
relative inference index is concluded by experimental data and shown as Table 2. 
 
 
Figure 3. Parameters of main drain and the inference transportation distance 
 
According to the empirical study above, 8 parameters are concluded to be the 
factors which affect the transportation performance of main drain in buildings. A 
simplified model was built to estimate an approximate solid transportation distance by 
statistic methodology. Accordingly, 2 additional parameters including second elbow 
condition within the drainage system are added into the estimation model. A single 
regression analysis was adopted to conduct the calculation equation as the following.

existing buildings currently in many countries. The fact that low flash water closet can 
save lot of water is firmly understood nowadays. However, it is also known that the 
performance of solid transportation is one of the crucial issues in building drainage 
system. Water saving equipment directly reduces the volume of flowing water in the 
piping system which could affect the solid transportation distance. If this conflict was not 
considered in the building drainage system design, it would increase the risk of solid 
transportation problems in drainage system. Especially, the cases which were refitted by 
saving water closet in existing buildings with no checking the piping system conditions 
are mostly risky and concerned in Taiwan recently. It is necessary to clarify the relation 
of solid transportation distance and conditions of drainage system including flash water 
volume and piping system.  
Firstly, this paper would investigate the present piping situation in existing buildings 
and category the parameters of solid transportation performance including piping size and 
length, elbow type, flash water volume and etc.. The next is the validation experiment to 
clarify the solid transportation influence from these parameters. Finally, this research 
offers an evaluation tool by statistic methodology to estimate the solid transportation 
performance. Furthermore, a regulation which can guide the designer and engineer to 
confirm the performance of drainage system is conducted and will soon link to building 
code in Taiwan. 
  
 
2. Reviews and Methodology 
 
The air pressure phenomenon on the stack and the influence to trap seal water was 
schematically understood. This study mainly focuses on the transportation ability of main 
drain in ground level of buildings. As technical review of this research, M. Kamata 
studied the least necessary flow velocity in open channel and main drain performance 
in1986. Afterward, L. Galowin presented several papers which related transportation of 
drainage piping on CIB W62 annual symposium since 1990.  
According to previous documents and technical reviews, it is obvious that the 
transportation performance of main drain would be constrained by the volume of flash 
from water closet. The relevant regulations and testing standards are arranged as the 
reference of this research. The national standards including CNS 3220 and CNS 3221 are 
current domestic regulations in Taiwan. The testing standard also includes ASME 
A112.19.6-1995 USA.  
Due to the complexity of main drain fitting, there is not yet limitation for the length 
of main drain in Taiwan’s Building Code so far. Even the NPC of USA and HASS of

connection from vertical stack to horizontal pipe. It is obviously that the solid delivery 
ability of main drain would be affected by the resistant of join connection. According to 
the investigation, there are single 90° join and double 45° join adopted in existing 
buildings, and very few cases use the special join in Taiwan. Therefore, the inference of 
join resistant needs to be clarified and confirmed. This study confirmed the effect of 
single 90° join and double 45° join by experiment to find the first parameter for 
transportation performance of main drain.  
In order to avoid some construction limitation and necessary function of space, the 
main drain has to change the direction or shift the way horizontally. Namely, the second 
parameter would be the effect of horizontal bend or elbow. As the real situation, the 
elbow of main drain is generally a composition join which includes single 45° join, 
single 90° join, double 45° join, big bend single 90° join and single 45° with T join.  
 
4. Experiment and Validation   
 
According to the initial investigation of existing building main drain, this paper 
concludes the parameters which would affect the transportation performance. Besides the 
flash volume of water closet, the parameters include pipe diameter, slope, vertical elbow 
and horizontal bend. In order to clarify the inference of the main drain conditions and to 
build a estimating model, these parameters need to be validated by experiment. A series 
of testing procedure was set up to confirm the index of these parameters.  
As one of the testing conditions to clarify the inference of flash volume, the water 
closets include previous type with 9.0 liter and low flash type with 6.0 liter. The inference 
of discharge floor height is considered either to the estimating model. As the imitated 
solid for experiment, two sponge bodies are adopted for test proceeds.  
Due to the existing building main drain condition is complex and the limitation of 
experiment device, this study try to consider the maximum possibility of drain 
compositions to simulate the real situation. Therefore, 16 groups of compositions are 
concluded to simulate all possibility of main drain fitting in existing buildings in this 
paper. Two sponge testing body was used as the imitated solid and 5 times of repeat

quantitative model to clear the limitation of transportation distance. According to the 
results of investigation and experiment data, this study determine the transportation 
distance of criterion condition as 10 meter which can derive the relative transportation 
distance of the other simulated conditions.  
Finally, this paper used 65 cases which were surveyed in this research to validate 
the proposed model and its practicability. The main drain total lengths of these existing 
cases are recalculated by the concluded inference index. The results are shown in 
Figure 4 and reveal as a normal distribution. If the permit length of main drain is 
determined as 10 meter, then there are 75% of these surveyed cases would be fail to this 
guideline. If the permit guideline is determined as 15 meter and 20 meter, then the 
failure rate would reduce to be 40% and 15%. Accordingly, the permit length of main 
drain is determined as 20 meter by empirical consideration and the practicability would 
be acceptable for an initial execution of proposed guideline.
