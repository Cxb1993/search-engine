propose not to report meaningless digits.
Discussion on the reporting format and procedures, including how many standard-
error digits to report and whether to truncate or round point estimate and standard
error, can be seen in Song and Schmeiser (2006).
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we define notation and
definitions. In Section 3, we investigate the probabilistic behavior of Θ̂ and of its digits.
In Section 4, we discuss the number of point-estimator digits to report? Section 5 is the
summary and conclusions.
2 Notation and definitions
We begin with some notation and definitions about the unknown performance-measure
value θ, the point estimator Θ̂, the point estimate θ̂, and its standard error σ. Throughout,
Greek letters refer to aspects of the point estimator and Roman letters refer to aspects of
the standard error.
For every integer j, let tj denote the jth digit of the performance measure θ and let
t̂j denote the jth digit of the point estimate θ̂; that is,
θ = · · · t2t1t0.t−1t−2 · · · =
∞∑
j=−∞
tj10
j
and
θ̂ = · · · t̂2t̂1t̂0.t̂−1t̂−2 · · · =
∞∑
j=−∞
t̂j10
j .
We say that the digit tj lies in the jth position of θ, and the digit t̂j lies in the jth
position of θ̂. Define
θ̂j = ⌊θ̂/10j⌋ × 10j = ...tj+2tj+1tj × 10j,
the value of the point estimate truncated to the digits · · · t̂j+2t̂j+1t̂j .
Analogously, let sj denote the jth digit of σ. That is, σ = · · · s2s1s0.s−1s−2 · · · Let
l denote the digit position of the leading digit (left-most non-zero digit) of σ; then the
leading digit of σ is sl, and the second-leading digit of σ is sl−1. If σ = 0, then define
l = −∞, corresponding to the limiting standard-error value as sampling continues forever.
3
We could measure the quality of the point estimator Θ̂ truncated at the jth digit using
P(|Θ̂j − θj | ≤ h× 10j)
for any h = 0, 1, .... That is, the point estimator succeeds if its truncated value is within h
units of the truncated value of the true value θ. A bit arbitrarily, we choose to use h = 0,
exact equality, yielding a specific definition of the probability of correct truncation.
Before discussing the probability of correct truncation, we want to discuss two distri-
butions associated with Θ̂j . First, define
pj(i) ≡ P(..., T̂j+2 = tj+2, T̂j+1 = tj+1, T̂j = i)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9, the joint probability that all digits to the left of column j are correct
and that T̂j , the digit in column j, takes the specified value i.
Second, we define the conditional distribution of T̂j given that all previous digits are
correct. Let
cj(i) ≡ P(T̂j = i|Θ̂j+1 = θj+1)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9, the conditional probability that T̂j = i given that all previous digits
are correct. For every integer value of j, these probabilities are related by
cj(i) = pj(i)/
9∑
k=0
pj(k)
for i = 0, 1, . . . , 9 and therefore
∑
9
i=0 cj(i) = 1.
3.2 Measuring the quality of Θ̂j
The “correct-truncation” probability of the point estimator Θ̂ truncated at the jth digit
is
pj ≡ P(Θ̂j = θj) = P(..., T̂j+1 = tj+1, T̂j = tj) ≡ pj(tj), (1)
the joint probability that all digits of Θ̂ are correct through position j.
As discussed in the next subsection, these joint probabilities can be used to compute
the “meaningful-digit” probability
cj ≡ P(Θ̂j = θj |Θ̂j+1 = θj+1) = P(T̂j = tj |Θ̂j+1 = θj+1) ≡ cj(tj), (2)
5
For asymptotically small values of j, the pj(i) values are easy to approximate, because
lim
j→−∞
pj(i)
f(θ)10j
= 1, (6)
where f denotes the density function of Θ̂. This limiting value provides a good approxi-
mation for all pj(i) for j < l (that is, in positions to the right of the leading-digit position
l). (For the normal distribution, f(θ) = (σ
√
2π)−1 ≈ (σ × 2.507)−1.)
For i = 0, 1, . . . , 9, the asymptotic result in Equation (6) leads to
lim
j→−∞
cj(i) = lim
j→−∞
pj(i)
pj+1
= lim
j→−∞
pj
pj+1
= 0.1. (7)
That is, the right-most digits of Θ̂ are uniformly distributed and therefore meaning-
less. Because the correct-truncation probabilities, pj, are monotonically decreasing, the
meaningful-digit probabilities monotonically decrease to the limiting values; that is,
1 > · · · > c2 > c1 > c0 > c−1 > · · · > 0.1. (8)
3.4 Probability bounds
Suppose that we report the truncated point estimate θ̂j , where j = . . . , 1, 0,−2, . . .. Here
we provide probability bounds for pj, pj−1 and cj−1 in the experiment when 10
l ≤ σ <
10l+1, where j is the right-most reported position, and j − 1 is the left-most unreported
position. The derivation of these bounds in given in Appendix A.
Theorem 1. If Θ̂ is normally distributed, then for any values of the performance measure
θ and standard error 10l ≤ σ < 10l+1 (i.e., with the leading digit in Position l),
pj ≥ Φ(10j/σ)− 0.5, (9)
Therefore, always
pj ≥ Φ(10j−l−1)− 0.5, (10)
with equality in the limit as σ → 10l+1. When σ = 10l,
pj ≥ Φ(10j−l)− 0.5, (11)
with equality when θj = θ. 
7
Corollary 2. This is the special case of Theorem 1, 2, and 3 when j = l. If Θ̂ is
normally distributed, then for any values of the performance measure θ and standard
error 10l ≤ σ < 10l+1 (i.e., with the leading digit in Position l),
pl ≥ Φ(10l/σ)− 0.5 (18)
Therefore, always
pl ≥ Φ(1/10)− 0.5 ≈ 0.0398, (19)
with equality in the limit as σ → 10l+1. When σ = 10l,
pl ≥ Φ(1)− 0.5 ≈ 0.3413, (20)
with equality when θl = θ.
pl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(10l−1/(2σ))− 0.5]. (21)
Therefore, σ = 10l yields the minimal upper bound
pl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(0.05)− 0.5] ≈ 0.0399. (22)
cl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(10
l−1/(2σ))− 0.5]
Φ(10l/σ)− 0.5 . (23)
Therefore, σ = 10l yields the minimal upper bound
cl−1 ≤ 2[Φ(0.05)− 0.5]
Φ(1)− 0.5
≈ 0.117. 

• If ci = 0.1, then t̂i = ti is no more likely than a randomly chosen digit, so the digit
is as meaningless as a digit can be.
Because there is no specific digit with the corresponding meaningful-digit probability
exactly 0.1, it is practically useless to define a digit to be meaningless if its meaningful-
digit probability is 0.1. The issue then is how to easily identify the meaningless digits
as based on the correct-truncation probabilities pj or the meaningful-digit probabilities
cj as computed using θ̂. We considered and discarded various ideas, one of which we
discuss here. The practitioner could omit all digits T̂j for which pj is less than a specified
bound, which would be approximately 0.04 or 0.05; or for which cj is less than a specified
bound, which would be approximately 0.11. Two disadvantages caused us to discard this
approach. First, computing such probabilities before reporting is cumbersome. Second,
the threshhold seemed arbitrary.
We define digit i to be ǫ-meaningless if c(i) ≤ 0.1 + ǫ. We also define digit i to be
ǫ-meaningful if it is not ǫ-meaningless. Consider two scenarios. One. If 0.017 ≤ ǫ < 0.666,
we have shown in Inequalities (17) and (24) that all digits of the point estimate to the
right of the leading digit of the σ (i.e., digits l − 1, l − 2, . . .) are ǫ-meaningless. Two.
If 0.0005 ≤ ǫ < 0.017, we have shown in Inequalities (24) and (31) that all digits of the
point estimate to the right of the second-leading digit of the σ (i.e., digits l− 2, l− 3, . . .)
are ǫ-meaningless.
3.6 An example of correct-truncation and meaningful-digit probabilities
Tables 1 and 2 show values of pj(i) and cj(i) for j = 3, 2, . . . ,−3,−4 and i = 0, 1, . . . , 8, 9,
respectively, under the assumption that Θ̂ is normally distributed with mean θ = 123.4500
and standard error σ = 0.6789. These parameter values are chosen arbitrarily, other than
to use various digit values for clarity.
The structure and meaning of Tables 1 and 2 is straightforward. Ten rows correspond
to the ten possible digit values {0, 1, . . . , 9}. The right-most eight columns correspond to
the digit positions, with order of magnitude ranging from 103 to 10−4. Each column is
labeled with j (its power of ten).
11
First consider the highlighted entry pj in the row corresponding to T̂j = tj in Table
1. The value of pj , j = −4, . . . , 3, is the probability of correct truncation: p3 = 1.0, p2 =
1.0, p1 = 0.9999998, p0 = 0.5373512, p−1 = 0.0587104, p−2 = 0.0058761, p−3 = 0.0005876
and p−4 = 0.0000588, the maximum values in each column. As always happens, the
probabilities pj monotonically decrease from one to zero, consider σ with Inequalities (4).
Consider σ with Equation (6), the right-side (say j ≤ −1) values of pj are approximately
equal to f(θ)10j = (σ
√
2π)−110j ≈ (0.6789× 2.5066)−110j ≈ 0.5876× 10j.
Now consider columns toward the right side of Table 1. All probabilities in each
Position j are approximately equal, and therefore approximately equal to pj. Also, the
probabilities decrease by a factor of ten as j is increased by one. This regular behavior
arises from the right-most digits T̂j being uniformly and independently distributed. When
such digits are incorrect (conditionally on the previous digits being correct), the corre-
sponding values of cj (in Table 2) are close to 0.1. Such digits are (almost) meaningless
in that they are (almost) independent of the digits of the point estimate θ̂.
Fundamental to determining which digits to omit is determining the left column of
the meaningless digits. The probabilities in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the statistical
experiment is “working on” determining the value of t0 = 3, which currently has proba-
bility p0 ≈ 0.537 and cj ≈ 0.537 of correctly truncating to Θ̂0 = 123. The digits further
left are deterministic. The distribution of Θ̂0, conditional that previous digits are correct,
is centered on the correct value Θ̂0 = 123 and has probability p0(2)+ p0(3)+ p0(4) ≈ 0.97
of truncating to within one unit of the correct value θ0 = 123.
As the statistical experiment completes the determination of digit T̂0, it has just begun
to work on the value of t−1 = 4. Four is the most likely value, with a meaningful-digit
probability c−1 ≃ 0.11 (in Table 2) ; that is, the experiment truncates to the correct value
t−1 = 4 about one time in nine replications. Thus the digit T̂−1 is performing just a bit
better than if it were uniform and independent. While digit T̂0 is worth reporting, digit
T̂−1 can be omitted with little loss of statistical quality.
4 How Many Point-Estimator Digits to Report?
We now discuss the motivating question—how many point-estimator digits to report? Our
reporting principle is to report only ǫ-meaningful digits of the point estimate. In other
word, we do not report ǫ-meaningless digits of the point estimate. Reporting meaningless
digits not only wastes reporting space (because they are all noise and no signal), but also
can lead to an incorrect interpretation.
13
4.2 The analysis of the second-leading-digit rule—reporting θ̂l−1
We analyze the probabilistic behavior of the truncated point estimate θ̂l−1 through the
second-leading digit l − 1 of the standard error. The second-leading-digit rule is more
conservative than the leading-digit rule in reporting digits, but does protect users from
loss of statistical information.
First, we discuss the behavior of the right-most reported digit T̂l−1. Bounds (25), (26),
and (27) indicates that T̂l−1 contains some statistical information about the performance
measure θ. At no time can the correct-truncation probability pl be smaller than 0.004,
which occurs when T̂l−1 is first reported. Later, when n has increased one-hundred fold,
which is at the moment that Θl−2 is first reported, the correct-truncation probability has
increased to at least pl−1 = 0.0398. That is, the probability that all reported digits match
the performance measure θ begins at about one chance in 250 and increases to about one
chance in twenty five.
Now, we discuss the behavior of the left-most unreported digit T̂l−2. Bounds (28)—
(31) guarantee that T̂l−2 contains negligible statistical information about the performance
measure θ. In particular, pl−2 ≤ 0.004 and cl−1 ≤ 0.1005. The former value 0.004, which is
almost equal to the lower bound for pl, guarantees that θ̂l−2 is correct to all digits less than
four time in thousand. The latter value 0.1005 is essentially the same as the one-in-ten
chance of uniformly distributed random digits, which would contain no information at all
about θ. Most of the time, while σ is not close to its lower bound 10l, the most-important
unreported digit θ̂l−2 contains even less information.
4.3 An example when a new digit is just about to be reported
Tables 3 and 4 show pj(i) and cj(i) values for an experiment with performance measure
θ = 123.45 and its point estimator Θ̂ has standard error σ = 0.100. This is the moment
in the experiment of Tables 1 and 2 when the sample size n has become large enough that
the standard error has fallen to a change in order of magnitude. For example, when σ is
going to change from 0.100 to 0.0999. In terms of the leading-digit rule, Position (−1)
has long been reported and Position (−2) is just ready to be reported. In terms of the
second-leading-digit rule, Position (−2) has long been reported and Position (−3) is just
ready to be reported.
Here, we show that the leading-digit rule (reporting θ̂l) is a bit conservative in this
example. Applying the leading-digit rule, the earlier positions have made progress: T̂0 =
t0 = 3 is now quite likely to be correct and T̂−1 is well on its way to identifying t−1 = 4.)
15
4.5 Yoneda’s Rule
Song and Schmeiser (1994) proposed reporting only meaningful digits of Θ̂, with no ex-
plicit statement of sampling uncertainty (such as the standard error or confidence inter-
vals). In response, Yoneda (1996) proposed truncating Θ̂ to Θ̂k so that the reader’s uncer-
tainty about the first unreported digit Thatk−1 approximated the uncertainty in Thetahat
as measured by the standard error σ. In particular, he minimized the discrepancy be-
tween the reader’s subjective uniform distribution and the point-estimator’s objective
normal distribution. Using the Kullback-Leibler information measure, he approximated
the minimum to obtain the closed-form rule that reports Θ̂k where k = log10(
√
6σ).
Yoneda’s rule reports a new digit a bit later than the leading-digit rule. In particular,
Yoneda’s rule roughly omits all digits that are 0.6-meaningless, compared to the leading-
digit rule’s omitting digits that are 0.117-meaningless. Both rules are reasonable, however,
because they have different purposes. Yoneda mimics the distribution of Θ̂ to reflect
uncertainty; the leading-digit rule mimics Θ̂ without wasting space and causing confusion
with random-noise digits. Both rules, as do all rational rules, print a new digit every time
that the sample size increases by a factor of one hundred.
5 Summary and Conclusions
The motivation of this research is to determine the number of point-estimator digits to
report in statistical experiments. We investigate the probabilistic behavior of a truncated
point estimator and its digits via two probabilities: “correct-truncation” and “meaningful-
digit” probabilities. We use these probabilities to define meaningless and meaningful
digits.
Conceptually, any specific digit is meaningless if its meaningful-digit probability is 0.1,
which is the one-in-ten chance of uniformly distributed random digits, indicating that this
digit contains no information about the performance measure θ. Due to the fact that there
is no specific digit with the corresponding meaningful-digit probability exactly 0.1, it is
practically useless to define a digit to be meaningless if its meaningful-digit probability is
0.1.
In this paper, we define a point-estimate digit to be ǫ-meaningless if its meaningful-
digit probability is less than or equal to 0.1+ ǫ, where ǫ is a small positive real value. We
also define a point-estimate digit to be ǫ-meaningful if it is not ǫ-meaningless. We propose
to discard ǫ-meaningless digits of the point estimate because reporting meaningless digits

Equality (35) is the definition of pj−1. Inequality (36) holds because Θ̂ is normally dis-
tributed and therefore the mode occurs at its mean θ. Specifically, Two areas θj−1 ≤ Θ̂ <

is closer to the mode θ. Equalities (37)
and (38) hold because Θ̂ is normally distributed.
