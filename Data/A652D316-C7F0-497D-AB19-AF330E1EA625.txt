1. INTRODUCTION
With the digitization of the scientific and technological
products in recent years, more and more devices need the
image processing skill, no matter in digital still camera
(DSC), cell-phone, projector, printer, liquid crystal TV,
LCD, video presentation systems (VPS), etc., they all need
to show good-looking images. DSC is used to take pictures
just like the conventional film camera. People prefer digital
camera over traditional camera for its convenience
nowadays. However, in many situations, the camera is
unable to work well under darker environment or unequal
light source. Unlike DSC, the VPS is usually used to show a
text document and then project the text content to a wide
screen. Fig. 1 shows a text image with shadow in its right
side because the source luminance is located at left. Due to
the non-uniform light distribution, we can’t see the details
clearly and it is difficult to read the text in the shadow of the
images. In [10], the authors proposed a method called SIBT
to enhance the quality of degraded text-photo images, other
similar methods can be found in the references of [10].
However, their algorithms are too complicated and not easy

to be implemented. In this paper, we propose a novel and
simple method based on EMD to improve the issue of non-
uniform light distribution for text images. EMD is a
powerful method for generating adaptive multiscale
structure of non-stationary signals and analyzing them
[1][2][3]. There are several variations of EMD algorithms
introduced in [4]. This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the algorithm of EMD. Section 3
presents the proposed technique for text image enhancement.
Experimental results and comparison with other methods are
shown in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are made in Section
5.
2. EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION
The EMD is first introduced by Huang et al. [1] for signal
processing. This novel tool decomposes non-linear or non-
stationary signals into frequency components called IMFs.
IMFs must satisfy the following two conditions:
• the numbers of extrema and the numbers of zero-crossings
must either equal or differ at most by one in whole data set.
• at any point, the mean value of the envelope defined by the 
local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima
is zero.
The process of extracting an IMF from a signal is called the
sifting process introduced in [1]. For a real-valued
signal )(tf , we can extract IMFs from it by the following
steps:
1) Initialize )()()( 00 tftrth  , i=j=1;
2) Identify all local maxima and minima of )(1 th j ;
3) We generate the upper envelope by interpolating the local
maxima, denoted )(thupper , and the lower envelope by
interpolating the local minima, denoted )(thlower ;
4) Compute the envelope mean,

5) Compute )()()( 11 tmthth jjj   ;
6) Repeat steps 2-5 and set j=j+1 until )(th j is an IMF;

whereα is theblack control. The value ofαis determined by
the user to control the text content clarity. We can make the
text blacker by setting the bigger value of αdue to text
image is usually black-and-white. Figure 3 (b) shows the
results of α=2. The processing flow diagram is summarized
in Figure 4.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm,
we take several text images with light source in different
side by digital camera and transform them into grayscale
images shown in the left column of Figure 5. These images
are processed by our uneven lighting removal algorithm.
Since EMD is adaptive locally according to image data, the
proposed work can automatically compute the ratio of text to
background level by equation (2) and use equation (3) to
adjust background level to white. The results in Figure 3 and
Figure 5, where the number of iterations in one sifting
process is 5, the number of sifting process is 3 for each line-
based EMD, andα=2in our experiment. These experimental
results show that our algorithm can remove the non-uniform
light distribution effectively no matter where the illuminant
light is and turn the background of text images to white.
Even when the text is not arranged horizontally, but is tilted
by some angle, e.g.45-degree, as the last row of Figure 5
shows. The proposed method still works well and
demonstrates its robustness. When the image is influenced
by poor lighting and uneven lighting simultaneously, our
approach still perform well. Recently, Angelica et al. [9]
proposed a method using morphological background
detection for enhancement of images with poor lighting.
They demonstrated the superiority of their method in dealing
with images with poor lighting. However, when the poorly
lighted images are also suffered from uneven lighting, their
method usually fails to tackle with it. As Figure 6 (b) shows,
although the poorly lighted part at the right side of the image
is enhanced, the well lighted left side is overenhanced. The
histogram equalization method fails to deal with the test
image well as Figure 6 (c) demonstrated. The resulted image
in Figure 6 (d) by applying our method shows that the
uneven lighting is removed and the scene is relighted
naturally. Our method eliminates the uneven lighting
successfully and demonstrates the text parts clearly, while
the other two methods yield inferior results. These figures
shows that our approach not only can deal with uneven
lighting but also can perform well under the poor lighting
condition or when the above factors are combined together.
The images are enhanced more naturally and visually
pleasing by our method, demonstrating the robustness and
superiority of our approach under different lighting
conditions in natural environments.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a novel algorithm for image uneven lighting
removal is proposed based on EMD. Besides, we give a new
form of method using line-based EMD to decompose text
images. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed technique can effectively improve the light
distribution for text images. This technique is valuable to
improve the quality of image with poor light distribution.
