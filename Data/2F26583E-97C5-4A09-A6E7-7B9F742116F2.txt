I. INTRODUCTION
The microvasculature plays an important
role in tissue function and pathogenesis; yet in
many diseases the etiology of microvascular
dysfunction is poorly understand. There is a
significant need for technologies to visualize
microvascular growth and remodeling in
pathogenic process. Early detection of abnormal
microvascular dynamics and morphology could
prove importance in effective interventional
strategies. Additionally, microvascular imaging
technologies may provide a much needed tool
for basic research and for monitoring
therapeutic efficacy in vivo.
Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) (i.e., high
frequency photoacoustic imaging) is a
promising hybrid technique that detects
absorbed photons ultrasonically through the
photoacoustic effect, and has the potential to
address some of these needs. In photoacoustic
imaging, short pulses of laser light are delivered
into the body. When the light is absorbed, a
rapid thermoelastic expansion launches acoustic
waves which are detected by ultrasonic
transducers and then reconstructed to form
images representative of optical absorption.
Optical absorption contrast is the key advantage
of PAM; For example, oxy-hemoglobin and
deoxy-hemoglobin provide strong optical
contrast at near infrared (NIR) and visible
wavelengths making PAM well suited to
imaging blood vessels. By comparison, the
contrast of conventional ultrasound images
tends to be limited by the relatively poor
echogenicity of blood vessels. By the use of a
high-frequency focused ultrasonic transducer,
photoacoustic sources from small blood vessels
can be localized with high spatial resolution
[1][2], which indicates PAM can be potentially
used to image microvasculatures. PAM may
complement high-frequency Doppler ultrasound
to detect very small vessels as well as those with
slow flow velocities.
II. DARK-FIELD CONFOCAL PAM SYSTEM
Figure 1 showed the system block diagram of
the 25-MHz or 50-MHz dark-field confocal
photoacoustic microscope used for in vivo

Figure 1. System block diagram
based on MATLAB® (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Natick, MA). A frequency doubled Nd:YAG
Q-switched laser (Surlite II-10, Continuum) was
employed to provide laser pulses with a pulse
width of 6.5 ns, a pulse repetition frequency
(PRF) of 10 Hz, and a wavelength of 532 nm.
Blood vessels own strong optical absorption at
this optical wavelength, guaranteeing that
detected photoacoustic signals mainly come
from vessels. The laser energy was delivered by
a multimode fiber with a 600-m diameter. The
fiber tip was coaxially positioned with a convex
lens, an axicon, a plexiglass mirror, and a
25-MHz (v324, Olympus) or 50-MHz
(Resource Center for Medical Ultrasonic
Transducer Technolgy, University of Southern
California) focused ultrasonic transducer on
an optical bench, which formed dark-field
illumination and make the light confocal with
the ultrasonic transducer. The optical bench was
fixed on a three-dimensional precision
mechanical scanner where the x- and y-axes
were motorized and the z axis could be
manually adjusted with a micro-meter. The
incident energy density on the sample surface
was < 1mJ/cm2, which is well within the ANSI
safety limit of 20 mJ/cm2.
The transducer was immersed in an acrylic
water tank, which had a hole at the bottom
sealed with a piece of polyethylene film. The
hole served as acoustic window. The imaged
part of the animal was placed below the film
and coated with a thin layer of ultrasonic gel to
ensure good coupling of photoacoustic waves.
The photoacoustic signals received by the
ultrasonic transducer were pre-amplified by an
ultrasonic pulser/receiver (5073 PR, Olympus),
low-pass filtered (LPF), digitized by a digital
oscilloscope (TDS 5034B, Tektronix), and then
photograph of the flipped mouse skin. It is
shown that our PAM system can precisely
localize the micro-vessel positions.

USM PAM
Figure. 5 B-scan images of a subcutaneous tumor from the 25-MHz
PAM and USM system. Left: USM image with 50-dB dynamic range;
right: PAM image shown in linear scale.
Figure 5 are the acquired B-scan images of a
subcutaneous tumor from our 25-MHz PAM and
USM system. The vessels are clearly imaged by
our 25-MHz PAM system. The USM B-scan
image provides complementary structure
information of the imaged tumor so that we can
identify positions of the vessels revealed in the
PAM image. The tumor cell line used is CT26–
a murine colon cancer cell line. The tumor was
imaged at 7 days post tumor inoculation. It is
shown by the PAM image that vessels are
mainly distributed around the tumor periphery
and less in the tumor core for the tumor at 7
days after inoculation.
D. Imaging Microvascular Changes in Achilles
Tendon of Mice
More applications of the developed PAM
system are also explored. For example, PAM is
used to monitor microvascular changes in
injured Achilles tendon of mice. The results are
shown in Fig. 6. Figs. 6(a), (c) and (b), (d) are
USM and PAM B-mode images, respectively.
The two dashed lines indicate the tendon
position. Figs. 6(a) and (b): normal tendons, and
Figs. 6(c) and (d): tendons with tendonitis,
imaged five days post collagenase injection.
PAM and USM images are shown in linear scale
and a 45 dB dynamic range, respectively. The
cross-section of tendon and the thickness of
dermis in Fig. 6(c) are larger than those in Fig.
6(a) due to inflammation and edema. The
increase of dermis thickness is also revealed by
the PAM images. Proliferation of new blood
vessels within the tendon is also observed in Fig.
6(d).

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this project, we have successfully developed
a dark-field confocal PAM system, which can
work at 25-MHz or 50-MHz imaging frequency
depending on the requirement of the
applications. The performance of the PAM
system are verified with phantom and in vivo
experiments. It is demonstrated that the
developed PAM system can provide high
resolution and high contrast imaging of
micro-vasculature of small animals. Future
work includes functional oxygen saturation
imaging of single vessels with the use of a
tunable laser system and integration of PAM
with ultrasonic Doppler flow imaging to provide
further velocity information.

The imaging setup and method in this discosure can be based on an

an adaptive sidelobe-reduction technique using aperture data synthesized
from mainlobe dominant principal components. In our method, the first few
principal components are used to synthesize a new aperture data where
undesired sidelobe contributions are partly reduced and then beamsum is
performed on this new aperture data; thus reducing the effect of focusing
errors and compensating the degraded image quality.
