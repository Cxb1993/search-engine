Abstract 
    This work investigated the wetting 
properties of Sn-8.55Zn-xAg-0.1Al-xGa and 
the interfacial reaction of Cu substrates. The 
wetting properties measured by wetting balance 
and the composition of intermetallic compound 
is investigated. The results show that with 
increase the Ga content, the wetting time of 
solder will be improved and better than Sn-9Zn. 
The aging treatment at 150℃ convents the 
AlCuZn and CuZn5 compound to Cu5Zn8. The 
Cu6Sn5 compound was formed closing to the 
Cu substrate after aging for 1000 hours. The 
AgZn3 was decomposed and Ag dissolves in 
Cu5Zn8 after aging for 500 hours. Addition of 
Ga into the solder also increases the thickness 
of Cu5Zn8 compound. Long time aging results 
in the formation of voids and consequently 
cracks between IMC and solder. 
 
二、緣由與目的 
在電子構裝中，銲錫是主要的接合材
料，必須提供良好的電性與可靠性，目前主
要使用的銲錫材料是價格較便宜的錫鉛合
金。然而鉛為具有劇毒的重金屬，因此，美
國在 1991 年提出了電子產品無鉛化材料的
主張1,2，而其他歐洲與日本等國也積極的投
入無鉛銲錫材料的開發。為了因應無鉛化的
趨勢，研發無鉛材料是刻不容緩的。而在選
擇新銲錫材料時需考慮下列特點：3~8
（1） 可銲錫性 
（2） 抗氧化性與抗腐蝕性 
（3） 無重金屬污染 
（4） 良好的導電、導熱、機械與電化
學性質 
低熔點而且可與現有的銲錫系統相容。 
本研究先建立出不含鉛的五元無鉛銲
錫，研究銅基材對五元銲錫之可銲錫性，同
時觀察潤濕後五元銲錫之界面反應機構及介
金屬化合物的種類與形態，以及界面經高溫
時效後的情形。 
 
三、實驗方法 
五元銲錫的配製是先利用微量天平秤出
五 元 銲 錫 (Sn-8.5Zn-xAg-0.1Al-yGa ，
x=0.1~0.5wt%，y=0.05~2wt%)所需要的成分，
再將配料置於石英管內並通入氬氣後將石英
管封口，在石英管內通入氬氣是為了避免銲
錫材料在熔融的狀態下氧化。其後將石英管
置於高溫爐內加熱至 800℃使其熔融，並持
溫兩小時，再爐冷至 250℃後水冷。 
3-1 熱性質分析與表面沾錫特性觀察 
本實驗利用熱差分析儀測量銲錫本身的
熔點，銀含量的增加所造成的熔點變化以及
兩相區區間的變化，並利用光學顯微鏡觀察
銅棒與銲錫反應後之表面沾錫狀況。 
3-2 潤濕性與界面顯微結構觀察 
    本實驗利用潤濕天平來分析銲錫合金中
改變銀含量對銅基材潤濕性的差異，將直徑
1mm的銅棒控制在浸鍍深度 9.9mm，浸鍍速
度 15mm/s，浸鍍時間為 15 秒，以及維持溫

4-3 界面反應的顯微組織觀察 
    將銲錫合金在 230OC下浸鍍於銅基材 15
秒的試片，由圖七可以發現，在界面處都會
形成Cu5Zn8，而圖七(a)中的CuZn5為Cu5Z n8
在較慢的冷卻速度時所形成的[9]，但隨著銀
含量的增加，界面處的AgZn3形成的量也會逐
漸變多，而潤濕反應主要為銲錫合金中的液
態鋅原子與銅基材中的固態銅原子交互反應
形成Cu5Zn8而造成，因此我們延長反應時間
到 60 秒，並利用液態氮冷卻，觀察所發生的
反應，從圖八EPMA的線掃描分析中可以發
現，增加銀含量，會抑制Cu5Zn8的成長，而
圖九為利用XRD對其做的定性分析，亦可看
出AgZn3隨銀含量添加量增加而增多。

圖十 五元銲錫未經時效的界面型態 
 
圖十為五元銲錫還未經時效處理時的界
面型態。如圖所示，在界面處有三層明顯的
介金屬化合物。內層靠近Cu基材的是Cu5Zn8
介金屬化合物，緊貼著Cu5Zn8顏色較暗的則
是CuZn5，而外層扇貝狀的介金屬化合物則是
AgZn3。圖十一則是EPMA元素線分析圖，由
此圖可知Al元素出現在界面，而圖十二XRD
的結果可知 Al 會與 Cu 跟 Zn 形成三元的
AlCuZn的介金屬化合物。Cu-Al，Cu-Zn和
Cu-Sn 在 250℃下的生成自由能分別是
-12.94KJ/mol ， -11.48~-12.25KJ/mol 和
-6.2~-7.63KJ/mol［10］，因此CuZn介金屬化
合物比CuSn介金屬化合物還容易在界面生
成，而CuZn5則是Cu原子與Zn原子交互擴散
反應所產生的。由於外層扇貝狀的AgZn3介金
屬化合物不會因為反應時間的增加而厚度改
變，因此AgZn3介金屬化合物是在凝固過程中
在界面非均質成核的［11］。有文獻指出，在
銲錫中添加Al元素會促進銲錫的潤濕性
［14］，因為Al很容易往界面聚集並與Zn快速
反應，而Cu也快速的溶解出來並與Al跟Zn形
成AlCuZn三元的介金屬化合物。

    圖十六與圖十七為EPMA元素分佈在五

小時時原本界面的三元介金屬化合物
AlCuZn還存在，而外層扇貝狀的AgZn3介金
化合物有些許Cu的訊號，而Ga則是均勻散佈
在錫基地中。但時效時間在 1000 小時後，
AlCuZn 三 元 介 金 屬 化 合 物 則 轉 變 為
Cu5Zn8，外層的AgZn3介金屬化合物也轉變為
Cu5Zn8，而Ag則是固溶在Cu5Zn8中，有文獻
指出當錫鋅銲錫與銀基材反應時會生成三層
的IMC，分別是AgZn，Ag5Zn8與AgZn3介金
屬化合物，當經過時效後AgZn和Ag5Zn8會逐
漸增厚，而AgZn3則會消失［15］，而AgZn3與
Ag5Zn8生成的自由能分別是-1979~-2275 cal/ 
g-atom和-2371~-2441 cal/ g-atom［12］，因此
在時效過程中AgZn3則會傾向轉變為穩定的
Ag5Zn8。但在此研究中並無足夠的銀使AgZn3
轉變為穩定的Ag5Zn8，而在Ag-Cu-Zn的三元
相 圖 中 Cu 在 AgZn3 介 金 屬 化 合 物 中 有
14.3atom%的固溶，而Ag在Cu5Zn8中更高達
48.6atom%［16］。而文獻也指出在Cu5Zn8與
AgZn3中間有發現Cu5Zn8與Ag5Zn8混合的結
構［17］，當銅基材的Cu原子不斷的擴散出
來，而固溶在AgZn3中Cu原子含量逐漸增加
達到飽和時，Cu5Zn8則析出，而Ag原子則會
固溶在原本AgZn3的位置。

1. The meeting was called to order by Chair Srini Chada at 7:00 AM. The attendees 
briefly introduced themselves. 
 
2. Minutes of the 2005 Annual Meeting held in San Francisco, CA were reviewed 
and approved. 
 
3. EMPMD DIVISION COUNCIL MEETING UPDATE:   Sung Kang gave an 
update from the Division Council Meeting held on March 13, 2006.  (1) The 
format of the “Pb-Free Solder Workshop” had been adapted as a model for 
alternative programming of TMS. Such workshops will typically start before the 
regular programming. TMS will provide rooms and audio-visual equipments for 
such workshops.  (2) The EMPMD division has adapted a guideline for future 
honorary symposia. The nomination for the honorary symposium must be 
proposed two years in advance of the actual symposium date through the 
committee channel. The honoree will automatically receive the EMPMD 
Distinguished Scientist/Engineer Award. (3) The symposium proposal for next 
year must be in the CMS system by March 31, 2006. 
 
4. PUBLICATION ACTIVITIES:  
(a)  JEM Publication of 2005 Symposium:  An e-mail was received from the 
guest editor (Mark Palmer) stating that he could not attend this meeting due to 
his personal health. Palmer could not finish putting together the special issue 
due to health reason. The special issue had not been published yet. JEM Chief 
Editor (Ted Harman) had decided that all the accepted papers from this 
symposium were published or going to be published individually in separate 
regular issues. Complaints from the authors were received by several members 
of this committee. This was the first time such incidence had ever occurred, 
and should be avoided in the future. Future editors should ask for help from 
the co-organizers or members of this committee if they think they cannot 
finish the editing.  
(b)  Pb-free Technology Workshop (Sunday, 3/12): Hay Fua reported that the 
workshop went well, and the attendance was between 60-72. 
A discussion on the TMS policy of charging a fee for attending the workshop 
started. Kang mentioned that TMS had made it a policy to support workshop 
activity. TMS will provide a room and AV equipment, but TMS will charge a 
fee on those attendees who do not register for the conference. The amount of 
the fee had not been decided yet. Some members of this committee expressed 
the opinion that charging such a fee might not be wise. Iver Anderson 
volunteered to bring this issue to the TMS board during the Board of Directors 
meeting on March 15.  
 
2006 Fall  (Cincinnati, OH, 10/15-10/19) 
(a)  Lead-Free Soldering –Applications, Alloy Development … :  Per the 
request of Chada, Iver Anderson will lead in organizing this symposium. Carl 
Handwerker volunteered to be as the third organizer, in addition to Anderson

Morphology of Intermetallic Compounds formed between Lead-free 
Sn-Zn Based Solders and Cu Substrate

Abatrate 
 The morphologies of intermetallic compound formed between Sn-Zn based 
lead-free solder because its melting temperature (198 ºC) is relatively close to that of 
eutectic Sn-Pb solder (183ºC)1,2.  Sn-Zn solders also have greater mechanical 
strength than the conventional Sn-Pb solders and lower cost than other lead-free 
solders1.  However, Sn-Zn solders exhibit unsatisfactory wettability as zinc is easily 
oxidized leading to the formation of an oxide layer1,2.  Thus, a protective atmosphere 
or an aggressive flux is needed during the manufacturing of electronic 
interconnections when using Sn-Zn solders1,3.  From the application point of view, 
an enhancement in wettability and oxidation resistance of Sn-Zn solders is necessary.  
Currently, a great number of research articles dealing with Sn-Zn based solders have 
been published.  Some studies have observed an improvement in the oxidation 
resistance on addition of Al to Sn-Zn solders and reported a eutectic composition of 
Sn-8.55Zn-0.45Al with a melting temperature of 197ºC4,5.  Small amounts of Al or 
Ag also can improve the wettability of Sn-Zn solders6,7.  Consequently, improvement 
in wettability oxidation resistance and mechanical properties by Ag and Al doping 
raises the potential application of Sn-Zn based solders as lead-free solders.   
It has been confirmed that the interfacial reaction products between solder alloys 
and substrates, such as the intermetallic compounds, have a great effect on the 
mechanical properties and reliability of solder joints.8-12  The brittle nature of the 
intermetallic compounds and the joining of two materials with dissimilar coefficient 
of thermal expansion cause degradation of interface integrity between substrates and 
solders.  In the avionics and automotive applications, the reliability of solders joints 
extremely depends on the interfacial structure because the solder joint is subjected to 
thermal cycles and high temperature circumstances up to 150ºC.  A previous paper 
has indicated that the interfacial morphology change of Sn-9Zn/Cu joint causes 
serious degradation of joint strength under thermal aging at 150ºC12,13.  It has been 
reported that cracks can be initiated and can propagate along the interface between the 
intermetallic compounds and solder under thermal fatigue test.  Hence, a 
understanding of the formation behavior of intermetallic compounds between solder 
alloys and substrate is required for the design and systematic evaluation of a new 
lead-free alloy.  This present study investigated the morphology and formation 
behavior of intermetallic compound between Sn-8.55Zn-0.45Al-(0~3)Ag based 
solders and substrate after dipping at 250ºC. 
II. Experimental Procedures 
The lead-free solder alloys investigated in this study were prepared by melting 
Fig.1. shows the SEM photographs of the interface between the solders and the 
Cu substrate after dipping test.  In Fig.1.(a), two compound layers were observed at 
the Sn-9Zn/Cu interface.  The inner compound layer of about 3µm thick was 
confirmed to be ?-Cu5Zn8 phase by EDS analysis.  The outer compound layer of 
about 1µm thick was identified to be composed of Cu, Zn, and a small amount of Sn 
(about 17Cu-80Zn-3Sn in atomic percent).  This chemical composition renders this 
layer to be the e-CuZn5 phase.  Lee and Yoon14 also have found that these two 
compounds was formed at the Sn-9Zn/Cu interface.  Fig.1.(b) and (c) shows the 
interfaces of the Sn-Zn-Al/Cu and Sn-Zn-Al-Ag/Cu specimens.  The interfacial 
morphologies of these two specimens were quite different from that of the Sn-9Zn/Cu 
specimen.  The continuous layer formed at the interface between Cu and solders 
appeared to be only about 0.5µm thick and consist of Al, Zn and Cu when Al was 
added into the Sn-Zn solder.  This result indicates that the Al participated in the 
interfacial reaction and suppressed the growth of the interfacial compound layer.  
Besides the thin Al-Cu-Zn ternary compound, a spherical and discontinuous Ag-Zn 
compound was further detected at the interface between the Al-Cu-Zn compound and 
the Sn-Zn-Al-Ag solder, as shown in Fig.1.(c).  The results of EDS analysis 
indicated that this compound was AgZn3 compound.  The results of XRD analysis, in 
Fig.2, show a phase of the intermetallic compound formed at the interface between 
these solders and Cu.  The peak at the Sn-9Zn/Cu interface between 43° and 44° 
inhibits the wider range of 2q value than other peaks in the XRD analysis.  It was 
inferred that the interfacial compound between Sn-9Zn and Cu should be Cu5Zn8 and 
CuZn5 compounds because the 2q value of these two Cu-Zn compound was very 
close at 43°~44°.  Except for the Cu-Zn compounds, a ternary compound, 
Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7, was detected at the interface between the Al-containing solders and Cu.  
The Ag-Zn compound was also confirmed to be the AgZn3 compound by XRD 
analysis.     
 
3.2 Morphology of AgZn3 compound between solders and Cu 
The SEM images of the interface between the Sn-Zn-Al-Ag solder and Cu with 
different cooling conditions are shown in Fig.3.  In these two specimens, the ternary 
Al-Cu-Zn compound and AgZn3 compound were detected at the interface, and the 
thickness of the Al-Cu-Zn compound was similar.  It means that the formation of the 
It has been reported that the Cu5Zn8 and CuZn5 compounds were formed at the 
interface between Sn-9Zn solder and Cu substrate13,14.  In this study, the Cu5Zn8 and 
CuZn5 compound, formed between Sn-9Zn and Cu, with a thickness of about 3µm 
and 1µm was also detected after dipping for 120sec as seen in Fig.1(a).  
Nevertheless, only Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7 compound, about 0.5µm thick, was formed at the 
interface when 0.45% Al was added to the Sn-Zn solder.  The thickness of the 
Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7 compound was relatively thinner than that of the compounds formed 
between Cu and Sn-9Zn.  The active Al element may tend to move to the interface 
and react with Cu and Zn to form the compound.  Previous studies have indicated 
that the thick and scallop Cu-Sn compound was formed at the interface between Cu 
and the other Sn based solders, such as Sn-Pb, and Sn-Ag-Cu solders1,8,11.  However, 
the Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7 compound of 0.5µm thick remained at the interface during dipping 
for 120 sec.  Cu did not penetrate this layer into the bulk solder.  This signifies that 
the addition of Al to Sn-Zn solder holds back the interfacial reaction, and the 
interfacial product, the Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7 compound, acts as diffusion barrier between 
solder and Cu.  A solder exhibiting this barrier characteristic was termed as “inherent 
barrier solder”15. 
4.2 Formation behavior of the AgZn3 compound at the interface  
Except for the ternary Al-Cu-Zn compound, the AgZn3 compound was detected 
at the interface between solder and the continuous Al-Cu-Zn compound, as shown in 
Fig. 1(c).  It is known that Ag-Zn compound was formed in the bulk solder when Ag 
was added to the Sn-Zn based solders16, while the AgZn3 compound was found to 
form at the interface between solder and Cu in this study.  Figures 3 and 4 show that 
the quantity of the AgZn3 compound decreased with an increase in the cooling rate of 
solidification.  The formation of the AgZn3 compound seems to depend on the 
cooling rate of the specimen.  The results of DSC analysis, Figure 7, indicate that the 
matrix of the Sn-Zn-Al-XAg solders melted between 200ºC and 220 ºC, but a small 
peak appeared between 220 ºC and 300 ºC when the Ag content was 0.5%.  This 
means that the Ag-Zn compound of the Sn-Zn-Al-0.5Ag solder melted from 220 ºC to 
300 ºC.  A previous study also confirmed that the Ag-Zn compounds did not dissolve 
in the molten solder at 250 ºC17.  Thus, the Ag-Zn compounds were first solidified 
before the matrix of the solder during cooling.  It was also found that the AgZn3 
compound was formed between solder and the Al-Cu-Zn compound.  It is inferred 
that the formation of AgZn3 compound was enhanced at the interface by 
and Cu was investigated in this study.  It was found that the Cu5Zn8 and CuZn5 
compounds were formed at the Sn-9Zn/Cu interface during soldering, while the 
Al-containing solder formed a ternary compound, Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7, at the interface.  
The thickness of the Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7 compound was thinner than that of the Cu-Zn 
compound between Sn-9Zn solder and Cu for the same soldering period.  The 
Sn-8.55Zn-0.45Al-0.5Ag solder further formed the spherical AgZn3 compound that 
attached to the Al4.2Cu3.2Zn0.7 compound at the interface.  It was confirmed that the 
AgZn3 compound formed at the interface was enhanced by heterogeneous nucleation 
during solidification because the quantity of Ag-Zn compound depended on the 
cooling rate of the specimen after soldering.
