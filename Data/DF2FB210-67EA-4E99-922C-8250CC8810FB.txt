Abstract 
 
Tsaur (2006) proposed and developed a fuzzy grey regression model for analyzing limited 
time series data by hybridizing the fuzzy set theory into the grey model GM(1,1), and solve it by a 
linear programming model with as little as four data. In this study, under necessity analysis, we 
continue the fuzzy grey regression model in order to propose an interval grey regression model for 
finding a minimum grey regression interval which is included in the collected interval data. 
However, the solution of the interval grey regression model under necessity analysis is usually 
infeasible. To deal with this problem, the fuzzy linear programming model is applied to fuzzify the 
constraints of the interval grey regression model with a given tolerance value. By requiring that the 
interval of interval grey regression equation can be included in the collected data, the optimal 
solution for the interval grey regression model can be obtained.

The time series model is a popular method in the forecasting of economic, marketing, as well 
as social problems under the limitation of needing at least 50 and preferably 100 observations. 
However, it is sometimes impossible to collect 50 data or more for forecasting a new product 
demand or a new system developing in the rapidly changing socio-economic situations. Therefore, 
the other forecasting models are developed in order to cope with such problem when the collected 
data is limited to violate the basic assumption of normal distribution of statistical models. Grey 
model with one order differential equation and one dependent variable model was defined as grey 
model GM(1,1) (Deng 1986) (Deng 1989) and introduced in management and engineering 
applications for solving limited time series data. For example, Hsu & Wen (2000) hybridized the 
grey model GM(1,1) and a multi-objective programming model to forecast airline city-pair 
 4
However, the fuzzy ARIMA model is still necessary to collect a lot of data to derive the parameters 
of ARIMA (p,d,q), otherwise the fuzzy ARIMA model still cannot work. In this study, for reliability 
under limited time series, the fuzzy set theory is hybridized into the grey model GM(1,1) to obtain 
the fuzzy grey regression model, and granulate a concept into a set with membership function, thereby 
obtaining the possibly interval extrapolation. Next, the fuzzy grey regression model is verified to 
show its validity in solving crisp-input data or fuzzy-input data with limited time series data. Finally, 
two examples for LCD TV demand are illustrated by the proposed models.

In this Section, for reliability, we first hybridize the fuzzy set theory into the grey model 
GM(1,1) in subsection 3.1 to evaluate the fuzzy relation between dependent and independent 
variables, and granulate a concept into a set with membership function, thereby obtaining the possibly 
interval extrapolation. Second, a newly developed product or a newly developed system, the data 
collected are limited and rather vague such that the grey model GM(1,1) is useless for solving this 
problem with vague of fuzzy-input values, then fuzzy grey regression model is verified in 
subsection 3.2 to show its validity in solving fuzzy-input data under limited time series data.

01 . In this study, in order to forecast with limited 
time series data, we first hybridize the fuzzy set theory into the grey model GM(1,1) to obtain the 
fuzzy grey regression model by using the limited data. Then the fuzzy grey regression model with 
crisp-input and fuzzy-output value is constructed as per Definition 1 by fuzzyfying the grey model 
GM(1,1) of Eq(7).

For the sake of simplicity, we define the fuzzy parameters ( )000  ,~ caA =  and ( )111  ,~ caA =  in the 
fuzzy grey regression model as symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers with central values a0, a1, and 
spread values c0, c1, respectively. Besides, their Figure and membership functions are formulated in

By solving the linear programming model (22), the fuzzy parameters ( )000  ,~ caA =  and

validity in solving fuzzy-input data under limited time series data. 
Furthermore, the value h is referred to as the degree of fit between the fuzzy-input values and 
the extrapolative fuzzy-output values of the fuzzy grey regression model, which thus determines the 
range of the possible distributions of the proposed model. That is, the value h is subjectively 
selected by a decision maker as a membership degree which requires that the collected data are 
included in the derived fuzzy interval to at least the degree h. Moskowitze and Kim (1993) 
proposed that if one is confident with the collected data, then a smaller value h can be assigned, 
otherwise a larger value h should be given. When h increases, the spread of the fuzzy-output value 
becomes wider. Tanaka and Watada (Tsaur et al 2002) suggested that h=0 when the data set is 
sufficiently large, and to use a comparatively higher h as the size of the data set becomes smaller. 
Bardossy et al (1990) selected the value for h according to the decision maker’s belief in the model, 
generally recommending an h value between 0.5 and 0.7. With the property of h, the resultant 
forecasting interval provides more flexibility for a decision maker.   
 
Illustrated Examples 
In Taiwan, since 1998, the growth in the TFT-LCD industry has been more rapid than the 
growth in the semiconductor industry. The initial application of TFT-LCD was in the notebook, but 
it is now also applied to PC and TV monitors. Display Search (Optotech  2005) reported that LCD 
TV demand has surged worldwide, with all regions enjoying at least 41% sequential growth. 
Topology Research Institute (2005) predicted that LCD TV will have a 50% market share in the TV 
industry by 2008 if the LCD TV price can be reduced through lower panel costs and new capacity 
optimization. In order to get a larger market share, TFT-LCD companies have been forecasting 
future demand in LCD TV market and planning a new generation of production line for large size 
panels. However, it is difficult to collect the world-wide sales of different sizes of LCD TVs so we 
roughly collected the secondary data from some research institutes. Because the collected time 
series data is limited and the secondary data collected from different research institutes is vague, the 
fuzzy grey regression model as proposed in Section 3 is a good method to forecast the future 
demand of LCD TV for the time period 2002 to 2005.  
 
Example 1 for Crisp-Input LCD TV Demand  
The secondary data of LCD TV demand with crisp-input value is shown in the second row of 
Table 1. By inputting the values of LCD TV sales into the model (22) and setting the value h as 0,

are 1379983 and 1850289 where the lower bound and upper bound in Watada’s model is 1101544 
and 3560000 whose range is 745544 which is too wide for a decision maker to make a decision 
under the uncertain environment. In addition, as the forecasting demand in some research institutes, 
the forecasting interval (20 251 110, 22 048 610) in fuzzy grey regression model is more precise 
forecasting for the LCD TV demand in 2005 than Watada’s fuzzy regression model.
