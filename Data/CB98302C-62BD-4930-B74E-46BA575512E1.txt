ABSTRACT:Heavy fuel oil is one of the most commonly used petroleum fuels in boilers, although it is associated with a high level
of pollutants. Emulsiﬁcation is a developing technique to enhance fuel eﬃciency and reduce regulated pollution emissions. In the
current study, the water phase of emulsiﬁed heavy oil contained 1 vol % methanol, 4 vol % isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 95 vol %
water, representing actual industrial solvent-containing wastewater (SCW). The SCW fractions in emulsiﬁed fuel were optimized by
thermal, centrifugal, and 14-day standing stability tests. The emulsion M1P4-10 with 10 vol % SCW showed no separation and
contained the smallest and most homogeneous water-in-oil (W/O) droplets after stability tests. Four boilers, including three with
3.6 and one with 10 ton h1 steam capacities, were employed to be operated for 30 h with a regular heavy fuel oil andM1P4-10. The
microexplosion and tinder eﬀects of solvent contents improved boiler eﬃciency by 1033% and reduced fuel consumption by
531% using M1P4-10. The emulsion also reduced SOx by 3.37.1%, particulate matter (PM) by 4185%, CO by 8993%, HC
by 9160%, and NOx by 3.323%. With regard to inhibiting toxic air pollutants, the emission levels of total polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and total benzo[a]pyrene (BaPeq) were reduced by 37.7 and 61.8%, respectively using M1P4-10. The PM
and NOx trade-oﬀ problem could be solved by lower temperature combustion of M1P4-10. Consequently, the solvent-containing
wastewater emulsiﬁed heavy fuel oil could eﬀectively promote boiler eﬃciency and reduce the pollutant emissions in a speciﬁc
emulsifying ratio.
1. INTRODUCTION
In some small countries, such as Taiwan, over 99% of the
energy required is imported,1 since they lack natural energy
resources. Reducing fossil fuel consumption is the most direct
and eﬀective way to deal with this problem, and thus, the
development of sustainable alternative fuels is essential. There
are over 6700 industrial boilers used as heating devices in
Taiwan.2 The three major fuels for such boilers are coal, heavy
fuel-oil (HFO), and natural gas, with HFO-fueled boilers ac-
counting for almost 50% of the total. The annual HFO con-
sumption in Taiwan was over 15 mega kiloliters (MkL) from
1991 to 2008. Moreover, the annual carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions from industrial boilers, the most signiﬁcant green
house gas (GHG), can be estimated as 44.3 mega metric tons
(Mt) by multiplying the HFO consumption (kL) by CO2
emission factor of HFO (2.98 t kL1 HFO).3 Additionally, the
high viscosity and sulfur content of HFO results in incomplete
combustion and leads to the emission of various pollutants,
including sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), carbon
monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide
(NOx), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs).
46 In
other words, pollutant emissions are likely to be decreased if the
combustion eﬃciency of such boilers can be improved.
Water-in-oil (W/O) emulsiﬁcation has been used as an
alternative fuel technology to achieve more complete combus-
tion and less pollutant emissions.7 Microexplosion (ME) phe-
nomenon is the major mechanism at work in emulsiﬁed fuels.
The water phase is ﬁrst dispersed uniformly by external forces,
such as mechanical stirring or ultrasonication. The speciﬁc
surfactant is then added into the mixture during the emulsiﬁca-
tion process to stabilize the W/O droplets. In the beginning of
the combustion process, the water droplets wrapped in oil are
heated and transformed into water vapor. Furthermore, the
vapor which has a volume about 1000 times that of the liquid
water explodes through the surrounding oil and separates theW/
O droplets into much smaller droplets that increase the total
contact area with the air. Thus, the combustion eﬃciency is
improved, and CO, HC, and PM emissions are further reduced at
the same time.8 In addition, the water vapor could react with CO
by water-shift reaction (COþH2OfCO2þH2) to reduce the
CO emissions and form hydrogen (H2). Nevertheless, using
emulsiﬁed fuel also could decrease the temperature of metal units

respectively. Each emulsified fuel was centrifuged in a 15 mL tube at
5000 rpm for 15 min. The ratios of the unstable separate layers (water)
in the centrifuged tubes were recorded to quantify the emulsion stability
after centrifugation. The lower the volume of a separate layer in the tubes
represents a more stable condition. Additionally, the following two
methods were employed to characterize the stability of the emulsion: (1)
a two-week (14-day) continuous record of fuel daily changes and (2)
observation and analysis of W/O droplet sizes using an optical micro-
scope (Olympus BX51TF, Tokyo, Japan) with 400 amplification and a
charge-coupled device video camera (Olympus DP20). The count mean
diameter (CMD), count median diameter (CMdD), and Sauter mean
diameter (SMD) of the W/O droplets were calculated using Image-Pro
Plus software version 5.0.2.9. After the stable blends were found, the
viscosities were further measured using an analog rotary viscometer
(NDJ-1) with the measurement range of around 0.110 000 cP and
(5% error. The heating values of fuels were measured using a
calorimeter (IKAC2000 basic) with a coolingwater supplier (IKAKV600).
2.3. Boiler Test. Four boilers, A, B, C, and D with 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, and
10 ton h1 steam capacities, respectively, were utilized to test M1P4-N.
The boiler system used in this study is showed in Figure 1. The flow rates
and temperatures of both fed fuel and flue gas were monitored by flow
rate meters and thermometers. The boilers were equipped with pressure
gauges and thermometers, which employed a control panel, to measure
the steam produced. The operation steam pressure was controlled in the
range of 67 kg cm2. Both HFO and M1P4-10 could satisfy the steam
demand and keep the downstream production operating well. For
maintaining the fuel at the desired preheated temperature, a set of
heating system was installed in the daily fuel storage tank, and the
thermocouple was fixed at the fuel pipe just before the injector. There-
fore, the injected fuel temperature could be well monitored and
controlled. The boiler efficiencies (η) were defined as the ratio of
output steam energy to input fuel energy as in the following equation
which was also used in Chen’s research.12
η ¼ Wðhv  hlÞ
HB
ð1Þ
In eq 1, hv and hl are the enthalpy (kJ kg
1) of the steam produced and
water fed, respectively, W is the mass of produced steam (kg), H is the
calorific value of fed fuel (kJ kg1), and B is the fuel consumption (kg).
All the parameters were recorded once per 30 min and continuously
operated for 30 h. The enthalpy of steam and heating value of fuel were
calculated and illustrated as a regression line. The slope of the line is the
estimated boiler thermal efficiency and would be further discussed.
The gaseous pollutants in the exhaust were monitored by the
standard methods of the National Institute of Environmental Analysis
(NIEA). Speciﬁcally, carbonmonoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)
were measured by a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer in the
measurement range of 010 and 020 vol %, while nitrogen oxides
(NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were measured using an electro-
chemical detector (ECD). An automatic stack sampler (AST) was used
to collect the particulate matter (PM) on a silicon glass ﬁber ﬁlter. The
PM mass on each ﬁlter was determined gravimetrically by an electronic
analytical microbalance (Sartorius ME 5-F) with an accuracy of 0.01 mg.
According to the regular standards of stationary source and sampling
method released from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administra-
tion, the concentrations of the emissions in ﬂue gas had to be calibrated
by following equations because the water content in WEHFO might
dilute the pollutant concentration.16
C ¼ 21On
21OsCs ð2Þ
Where,C represented the calibrated concentration;Ov was the reference
oxygen level (6%) in stack;Os was the oxygen level in the ﬂue gas; andCs
stood for the pollutant concentration collected by the regular method.
Sampling and analysis of PAHs were conducted according to the
NIEA A730.70C method promulgated by the Environmental Analysis
Laboratory at the Environmental Protection Agency of Taiwan. This
method quantiﬁes both gaseous- and particulate-PAHs in the exhaust
gas through a standard process, including ﬂue gas collection, Soxhlet
extraction, nitrogen purging concentration, cleanup, reconcentration,
and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) quantiﬁcation.
The masses of primary and secondary PAH ions were determined by
using the scan mode for pure PAH standards ﬁrst. The PAHs were
further quantiﬁed by using the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode.
The detection limit (DL) estimated by a serial diluted standard solution
of 21 PAHs was 71936 pg. The limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ)
is deﬁned as the DL divided by the sampling volume and was
0.1181.56 ng m3 for individual PAH compounds in the current
study. Seven consecutive injections of a PAH standard yielded relative
standard deviations (RSD) between 4.60 and 8.24% of the GC/MSD
integration area. The R2 of calibration lines in the 21 PAH compounds
ranged from 0.995 to 0.999. Additionally, the experimental results
showed that the average recovery (n = 3) of individual PAHs by NIEA
A730.70C was 83112%. Analyses of ﬁeld blanks, including glass-ﬁber
ﬁlters and cartridges, indicated no signiﬁcant PAH level (GC/MS
integrated area less thanDL).More experimental details can be obtained
by referring to theNIEAmethod. According to themolecular weight, the
21 PAH homologues are divided into three categories: low molecular
weights (LM-PAHs, containing two- and three-ring PAHs), middle
molecular weights (MM-PAHs, containing four-ring PAHs), and high
molecular weights (HM-PAHs, containing ﬁve-, six-, and seven-ring
PAHs). The total-PAH level of the ﬂue gas from the boiler is the
summation of 21 individual PAHs. Additionally, the total equivalent
toxicity of PAHs is deﬁned as the total BaPeq, which is the summation of
the products by multiplying the 21 individual PAHs toxic equivalency
factors (TEFs) with their own emission concentrations.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Fuel Stability. After the centrifugal test, the higher
temperature induced significant separation (Table 1), because
the increase in temperature effectively reduced the viscosity, and
the water phase with higher density tends to separate from the
emulsion. Table 1 also shows that the separate layer increased in
volume with increasing SCW ratio. At 120 C, the separate layer
increased significantly from 0 to 8.47 vol % with 1030 vol %
water phase. The emulsified fuel with 10 vol % water phase
additive (M1P4-10) had almost no separate layer in all tempera-
ture conditions after centrifugation, which means 10 vol % water
phase emulsion has the best stability among the three additive
fractions.
After a two-week (14-day) standing test, M1P4-30, which had
the highest 30 vol % SCW addition, had the highest ratio in
volume of separate layer, while M1P4-10 had no separate layer
(Figure 2). Both M1P4-20 and M1P4-30 destabilized during the

operation of boilers were smooth enough to get the reliable
thermal efficiency data. The efficiencies are enhanced 10.4, 11.7,
32.9, and 10.8% by using M1P4-10. At the same time, the
equivalent HFO consumption is reduced by 12.3, 6.2, 31.2,
and 5.0% in the four boilers, respectively. These improvements
are due to several changes in the properties of emulsified fuel.
Kinematic viscosity is the most effective factor with regard to
spray combustion. The viscosities of emulsified heavy fuel oils
have been reported as having higher values than that of regulated
heavy fuel oil.7 No exception, the viscosities of the emulsified
fuels in this study increased with increasing SCW fractions, and
significantly decreased with increasing temperature (Figure 5).
Generally, a more viscous fuel results in higher surface tension
and harder nebulization, which further produces coarse droplets,
incomplete combustion, and reduction of energy efficiency.7
However, the performances of the four boilers showed significant
improvements when using more viscous M1P4-10 emulsion.
This conflicting result is based on the effects of microexplosions.
Ikegami et al. indicated that fuel would splash less but have a
higher tendency to microexplode if it was heavier and more
viscous.21 In comparison to the emulsified diesel tested in engines,
the injector of diesel engine is much more precisely designed
which provide a relatively better atomization. According to the
research of Ikegami, the much more viscous HFO has a higher
tendency to microexplode. Thus, the atomization improvement
of HFOwould more significant than that of emulsified diesel fuel
and further enhanced the thermal efficiency. Additionally, the
solvent contents with lower boiling points and activation en-
ergies are first ignited and produce radicals as tinder in the initial
combustion. Furthermore, the oil drops extract the heat, react
with the radicals from precombusted solvents, and are then
ignited. Thus, the chain-propagation combustion reactions are
provoked more rapidly than with a traditional heavy fuel oil. The
lower stack temperatures after using M1P4-10 also lead to the
decrease in heat loss with the flue gas. Notably, the HFO based
efficiency of boiler C was relatively lower than that of the other
three boilers because of the lower preheating temperature and
higher viscosity of fuel in the daily tank. However, the perfor-
mance of boiler C was improved by nearly 30% after usingM1P4-
10. This result again supports the better ME hypothesis of
Ikegami and explains why a slightly more viscous emulsified
heavy fuel oil-leads to better nebulization and higher thermal
efficiency. The preheating temperature was optimized by tuning
5 C down per test and checking if the circulated fuel pipe stayed
in continuous flow. The preheating temperature is suggested to
be set at 60 C, and this adjustment can provide both a suitable
viscosity for nebulization and inhibit early evaporation of the
water phase, which would break the fuel supply. Another reason
that also provides this great improvement might be the different
cleaning period of each boiler. Boilers A and B worked after a
temporary cleaning process which leads to higher boiler effi-
ciency and lower PM and CO emissions using based fuel. In the
opposite condition, boiler C had relatively more coke which
could reduce the thermal conductivity. Therefore, the use of
M1P4-10 not only leads to a better atomization, but also had the
cleaning effect of a long-term operating boiler. Consequently,
the M1P4-10 with a suitable preheating temperature promotes
microexplosions and combustion, even if the initial fuel droplets
are coarser near the nozzle than those of HFO.
With regard to the social eﬀects of using M1P4-10 as an
alternative heavy fuel-oil, the estimation could be based on the
annual HFO consumption. The water to fuel volume ratio (W/
F) is a commonly used parameter to estimate the boiler eﬃciency
in practical boiler operations. In the current study, M1P4-10
could reduce the “water to equivalent HFO ratio” (W/HFO) by
Figure 5. Kinematic viscosities of fuels at various temperatures.

meters (a) and cumulative density fractions of various W/O droplet

(Table 3) by using M1P4-10, while both CO and HC emitted
from the 10 t steam h1 boiler were not significantly reduced.
These reductions were resulted from the microexplosions and
more complete combustion. Furthermore, the solvents contained in
SCW could be the key to initiating the chain-combustion
reactions,29 as discussed above. Additionally, the slightly higher
viscosity of M1P4-10 might affect the spreading angle of the
nebulizing jet by following eqs 3 and 4.30
r1=2=x ¼ 2:97

where r1/2 is the jet half-width; μ is the absolute viscosity; F is the
density of fuel; νe is the axial velocity; R is the radius of nozzle;
and Rej is the Reynolds number of the jet flow.
According to eqs 3 and 4, the emulsiﬁed fuel with higher
viscosity led to a wider spreading angle and a shorter fuel-air
reaction zone in the boiler.30 The ﬂame would be highly con-
centrated to oxidize most of the HC, CO, and organic com-
pounds and, further, to release more potential energy from
pollutants.31 However, the higher viscosity brings up the dis-
advantage of lower quality nebulization. Fortunately, the ME
mechanism could provide a second atomization to form much
ﬁner fuel droplets. Thus, the CO and HC emissions tended to
decrease by using M1P4-10. In comparison to using M1P4-10 in
diﬀerent scale boilers, the reductions in CO emissions were more
signiﬁcant in the small boilers, while the baselines of CO and HC
emissions in the 10 t steam h1 boiler were initially very low.
Notably, boiler C had relatively higher CO and HC baseline
emissions of HFO than those of the others. These results could
also be explained by the lowest preheating temperature in the
daily fuel tank of boiler C. Again, the ME overcame the eﬀect of
more viscous fuel at lower temperatures. Nevertheless, the lower
HC also inhibited the surface accumulation in PM formation
processes.32 This result was supported by the aforementioned
PM reduction.
Generally, NOx is formed by the Zeldovich mechanism, fuel
nitrogen content, and prompt formation. Since the nitrogen
concentration was low in fossil fuel, the NOx coming from that
originally contained inHFO could be neglected. NOxwasmainly
formed by the Zeldovich mechanism, in which the nitrogen (N2)
reacts with oxygen (O2) in high temperature conditions in this
study. The temperature, duration time of reactants, and O2
concentration in the combustor might all aﬀect the NOx forma-
tion. The use of M1P4-10 reduces the NOx emission by 11.0,
12.7, 14.4, and 37.4% in the four boilers (Table 3). The
reductions in ﬂue gas temperature (Table 2) explain the inhibi-
tion of thermal NOx emissions, because both the lower heating
value of M1P4-10 and the extra latent heat of the water content
could slightly quench the combustor.33 The latent heat of water
also caused a short ignition delay, widened the premixed region
of combustion, and further narrowed the diﬀusion ﬂame. The
equivalent ratio of premixed ﬂame was lower than stoichiometric
condition (diﬀusion ﬂame). Thus, the overall combustion tem-
perature was lower and leads to low PM and NOx formation at
the same time. On the other hand, the prompt NOx should react
with HC in a very rich condition, which was eﬀectively inhibited
by water dilution. Traditional end-of-pipe (EOP) methods to

the reductions in the aromatic content in the original fuel
and the lower level of PM, which was the major adsor-
bent of HM-PAHs with high toxicities. Consequently,
M1P4-10 is an ideal alternative heavy fuel that can both
save energy and reduce the pollutant emissions.
(8) M1P4-10 prepared by pure methanol, isopropyl alcohol,
and water could enhance energy eﬃciency and reduce
pollution in this study. In a real recycled wastewater case,
the distillation would be essential before the emulsiﬁca-
tion. After the distillation, methanol, IPA, and water
could be extracted from the more complicated steam.
Of course, the source (factory) of wastewater has some
constraints, such as no halogens, no heavy metal, no
sulfur content, and lower ionic strength of the aqueous
phase to prevent the secondary pollution and stabilize the
emulsiﬁed fuel.

                          Abstract 
 
The International Aerosol Conference (IAC) is the largest event where 
the international research community of aerosol science and technology 
comes together. The IAC is organised under the auspices of International 
Aerosol Research Assembly (IARA), which selects the host and the 
venue of the conference. The conference is organised very four years 
rotating between Europe, USA, and Asia. The IAC 2010 is held in 
Helsinki, Finland, and it is organised by the Finnish Association for 
Aerosol Research (FAAR) together with the University of Helsinki, 
Finnish Meteorological Institute and VTT Technical Research Centre of 
Finland. For this year’s IAC, a record number of abstracts have been 
submitted. The total number of presentations is 5 plenary lectures, 536 
oral presentations and 734 poster presentations. Following the European 
tradition, all submitted abstracts were reviewed by the Working groups of 
the European Aerosol Assembly (EAA) and were assigned to 88 oral 
sessions and 3 poster sessions. Topics of specific interest are also 
addressed in 13 special sessions.  
It is my honor that the abstract entitled” Atmospheric polychlorinated 
dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers 
(PBDEs) levels contributed by municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) in 
southern Taiwan” was accepted by IAC2010 as a poster presentation. The 
visit to the IAC2010 is not only an opportunity to announce my own 
research to the researchers from other countries, but also a chance to 
compare the novel techniques in aerosol field among other countries to 
Taiwan.
