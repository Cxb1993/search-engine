Abstract 
  This work reports the fabrication of a top-emitting 
polymer light-emitting diode (T-PLED) using an 
Ag/Ag2O anode and semi-transparent poly(ethylene 
oxide)/Ca (10 nm)/Ag (20 nm) cathode. The 
poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene 
vinylene) (MEH-PPV)-based T-PLED exhibits 
saturated bright red electroluminescence (EL) with 
high luminous efficiency. The EL efficiency, full 
width at half maximum and Commission 
International de I’Eclairage coordinate of the 
T-PLED are 3.6 cd/A, 38.7 nm, and (x=0.666, 
y=0.333), respectively. The favorable performance is 
attributed to the formation of an appropriate 
microcavity structure, which results in the spatial 
redistribution and enhances the out-coupling of EL 
emission in the direction of the surface normal. 
 
Introduction 
  Organic/Polymer light-emitting diodes (O/PLEDs) 
have attracted considerable attention due to their 
potential for use in next-generation displays.1-3 A full 
color O/PLED structure coupled with more 
complicated pixel circuits of thin-film transistors 
appears to be essential to realizing the full potential 
of display technology. However, the light emission of 
conventional O/PLEDs is through a transparent 
bottom electrode and glass substrate. The major 
disadvantage of this structure is that the emission 
aperture shares the substrate with the device 
electronics, limiting the pixel aperture. Consequently, 
a higher driving current is required to achieve a given 
pixel brightness. A high current is undesirable 
because it increases higher power dissipation and 
reduces device lifetime.4 This problem can be 
prevented if all electric devices are buried under an 
O/PLED that practically emits over the entire pixel 
area. This design can be achieved by top-emitting 
architecture (T-O/PLEDs).  
T-O/PLEDs generally comprise a highly reflective 
bottom electrode, organic layers and a 
semi-transparent top electrode for emitting light. The 
semi-transparent top electrode usually uses thin metal 
films, which are easily deposited by evaporation.5-9 
These metal films normally are highly reflective, 
causing the T-O/PLEDs to exhibit a strong 
microcavity effect, which is responsible for the strong 
dependence of the emitted radiation pattern, 
out-coupling efficiency, spectral narrowing and 
emission color on device structure.8-13 The optical 
length of the microcavity and the properties of metal 
mirrors (electrodes) are two important parameters 
that govern the microcavity effect. Altering the 
optical length to adjust spectral characteristics of 
T-O/PLEDs has been widely studied.9,12,13 Few 
reports have yet investigated the effect of top mirrors 
(cathodes) on the spectral characteristics of 
T-O/PLEDs. This work explores the correlations 
between the EL characteristics of 
poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene 
vinylene) (MEH-PPV)-based T-PLEDs and the 
properties of the different semi-transparent cathodes 
(Ca/Ag and Al/Ag). One of them is suitable as the top 
electrode to improve color purity and saturation of 
the MEH-PPV-based T-PLED, achieving the 
recommended red for high quality display. 
Additionally, effective electron injection is critical to 
both top mirrors, and can be performed for 
MEH-PPV-based PLEDs utilizing a Ca or an Al 
cathode modified with an ultra-thin poly(ethylene 
 4
T-PLEDs with the PEO/Ca/Ag cathode decreases 
from 38.7 nm to 12.5 nm as the thickness of Ag 
increases from 20 nm to 40 nm. This result is well 
understood as indicating that the reflectivity of the 
top mirror (R2) can be effectively enhanced by 
thickening the Ag overlayer. However, the drop in 
the FWHM depends less on Ag thickness by using a 
PEO/Al/Ag mirror than a PEO/Ca/Ag mirror. The 
difference between the FWHM of T-PLEDs with 
PEO/Al(10 nm)/Ag(20 nm) and that of PEO/Al(10 
nm)/Ag(40 nm) is only 8.8 nm (UFWHMAl = 8.8 
nm), which is much smaller than that between the 
T-PLEDs with PEO/Ca(10 nm)/Ag(20 nm) and 
PEO/Ca(10 nm)/Ag(40 nm) (UFWHMCa= 26.2 nm), 
perhaps because of the difference between the skin 
depth of Ca and that of Al. Light can normally 
propagate a small distance inside a metal before most 
of it is reflected, which depth is called skin depth. 
The skin depth of Ca is about 20.8 nm at 600 nm, 
exceeding that of Al (6.8 nm),6,17-19 indicating that Ag 
can contribute more of the reflectivity of the 
PEO/Ca/Ag mirror than of the PEO/Al/Ag mirror. 
Equation (2) reveals that the variation of UFWHM 
between the different top mirrors may be related to 
the differences between resonant wavelengths. The 
CIE coordinates of T-PLEDs with PEO/Ca(10 
nm)/Ag(20 nm), PEO/Ca(10 nm)/Ag(40 nm), 
PEO/Al(10 nm)/Ag(20 nm) and PEO/Al(10 
nm)/Ag(40 nm) cathode lie on (0.666,0.333), 
(0.673,0.323), (0.591,0.401), and (0.594,0.396), 
respectively. The coordinates with PEO/Ca/Ag are 
close to the National Television Standards Committee 
recommended red for a video display (0.67,0.33). 
The inset in Fig. 1 presents the photographs of the 
top-emissive device fabricated from a PEO/Ca (10 
nm)/Ag(20 nm) cathode. 
Figure 2 plots J-L-V curves of the various 
devices with PEO/Ca/Ag cathodes. The brightness of 
T-PLED with PEO/Ca(10 nm)/Ag (20 nm) exceeds 
that of the bottom-emitting device in the direction of 
the surface normal and the operating voltage of 
T-PLED approaches that of the bottom-emitting 
device. The EL efficiency of T-PLED is 3.6 cd/A, 
which exceeds that of the bottom-emitting device (2.3 
cd/A) (the inset of Fig. 2). The T-PLED exhibits 
superior device performance, which is attributed to 
both the effective injection of charge carriers and the 
extraction of EL emission from the semi-transparent 
cathode. With respect to cathode part, introducing an 
ultra-thin PEO layer between the cathode and the 
MEH-PPV layer significantly enhance the device 
performance. Table 1 shows the EL efficiency of the 
bottom-emitting device with a PEO/Ca/Ag cathode, 
which markedly exceeds that of a device with Ca/Ag. 
Hence, the semi-transparent PEO/Ca/Ag cathode was 
used to replace the conventional semi-transparent 
cathode of T-O/PLEDs, such as LiF/Al/Ag or 
Ca/Ag.5,7,8 Based on our previous reports,14,15 a 
specific interaction occurs at the PEO layer during 
the deposition of the cathode, promoting the injection 
of electrons. Besides, the formation of  the Ag2O 
layer at the surface of Ag by UV-ozone treatment 
significantly improves the injection of holes from the 
Ag anode because the work function of Ag2O is 
about 5 eV, which exceeds that of Ag (4.3 eV).5 A 
more efficient T-PLED can be fabricated by 
modifying both electrodes.  
The J-V curves of both T-PLEDs with 
different Ag thicknesses are almost identical, but the 
brightness associated with the thicker Ag covering 
layer is much smaller than that of the other at the 
same operating voltage. The EL efficiency of the 
device with a 40 nm-thick Ag film is about half that 
of the device with a 20 nm-thick Ag film (the inset of 
Fig. 3). The T-PLED with the thicker Ag covering 
layer has a lower light output because the 
transmission of the composite cathode is lower. The 
optical transmission of the PEO/Ca(10 nm)/Ag(20 
nm) cathode at 628 nm is about 19 %, while that of 
the composite cathode with 40 nm-thick Ag covering 
layers is only ~ 5 %. Although the thicker Ag 
covering layer result in the stronger microcavity 
effect to effectively reduce the FWHM, the extraction 
of EL emissions from the top-emissive devices is 
worsened. The tradeoff between two conflicting 
requirements is critical to achieving highly efficient 
and saturated T-PLED. 
Figure 4 compares the angular distribution of 
EL intensity (normalized to the 0o intensity of the 
bottom-emitting device) from the bottom-emitting 
device with that from the top-emitting device with 
PEO/Ca(10 nm)/Ag (20 nm) cathode. Clearly, the 
angular dependence of the bottom-emitting device is 
well fitted by a Lambertian distribution, the same is 
not true for the other one. The top-emitting device 
shows enhancement in the forward direction (with a 
spectrally integrated enhancement of ~ 2.3 at viewing 
angle of 00) and suppression at the large viewing 
angles (> 50o). The more directed emission in the 
T-PLED results from the modified emission
