Abstract 
This report considers the robust-optimal 
design problems of output feedback controller 
for linear singular systems with structured 
(elemental) parameter uncertainties by using 
the orthogonal function approach (OFA) and 
the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA). 
A new sufficient condition is proposed to 
ensure that the linear singular systems with 
structured parameter uncertainties by directly 
considering the quadratically-coupled 
structured uncertainties in the problem 
formulation are regular, impulse-free and 
asymptotically stable. Based on the OFA, an 
algorithm only involving algebraic 
computation is derived in this paper. Then, by 
integrating the OFA, the HTGA and the 
proposed sufficient condition, a new 
integrative approach is presented to find the 
output feedback controllers of the linear 
singular systems with both structured and 
quadratically-coupled structured parameter 
uncertainties such that the control objective of 
minimizing a quadratic integral performance 
criterion subject to the stability robustness 
constraint is achieved. A design example of 
the robust-optimal output feedback controller 
for the two degree of freedom 
mass-spring-damper system with structured 
parameter uncertainties is given to 
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 
new integrative approach. 
Keywords: Stability robustness, singular 
systems, output feedback controller, structured 
uncertainties, orthogonal function, genetic 
algorithm. 
 
二、計畫緣由與目的 
In recent years, there has been a growing 
interest in the system-theoretic problems of 
singular systems due to the extensive 
applications of singular systems in large-scale 
systems, circuits, power systems, economics, 
control theory, robots, mechanical systems, 
and other areas (Lewis, 1986; Dai, 1989). 
Sometimes the singular system is called 
generalized state-space system, implicit 
system, semi-state system, or descriptor 
system (Lewis, 1986). Recently, several 
results and methods for the analysis and 
design of linear singular control systems have 
been presented in the literatures (see, for 
example, Lewis, 1986; Bender and Laub, 1987; 
Dai, 1989; Bunse-Gerstner et al., 1994; Yu 
and Muller, 1994; Tsai et al., 1995; Jennings 
et al., 1996; Tornambe, 1996; Chou and Liao, 
1998, 1999; Lin and Chen, 1999; Zhang et al., 
2000; Chou and Chen, 2001; Kuo and Fang, 
2003; Muller, 2003; Stefanovski, 2006; Chen 
et al., 2007; and references therein). On the 
other hand, it is well-known that an 
be expressed as the following closed-loop 
uncertain singular system:

and 
2)( ijjiij KCBKCBA += . 
Hence, for the closed-loop uncertain 
singular system in Eq. (5), the problem of 
robust stabilizability analysis can be 
formulated as: under the condition that an 
output feedback gain matrix K  has been 
specified in advance to make the linear 
nominal singular system )()( txAtxE =&  denoted 
by ) ,( AE  regular, impulse-free and 
asymptotically stable, derive a robust 
stabilizability criterion for checking whether 
the linear uncertain singular system in Eq. (5) 
denoted by ) ,( AAE Δ+  is still regular, 
impulse-free and asymptotically stable or not.  
For the linear uncertain singular system ( ), , AAE Δ+  we assume that an output 
feedback gain matrix K  has been specified in 
advance to make the linear nominal system ( )AE  ,  regular, impulse-free, and 
asymptotically stable, then we can see that 
( 1−− AsE )  is a proper rational matrix. Since 
( 1−− AsE )  is a proper rational matrix, it can be 
uniquely decomposed as (Chou and Liao, 
1999): 
     ( ) ( ) ,1 JsGAsE sp +=− −               (6) 
where  is a strictly proper matrix part 
of 
( )sGsp
( ) ,1−− AsE  and J  is a constant matrix part. 
In what follows, we present a robust 
stabilizability criterion to analyze whether the 
linear uncertain singular system ) ,( AAE Δ+  
remains regular, impulse-free and 
asymptotically stable as the linear nominal 
singular system ( )AE  ,  does, where the output 
feedback gain matrix K  has been specified in 
advance. 
 
Theorem:

to this feedback gain matrix K  can be 
calculated. Given another output feedback 
gain matrix K , there obtains another value of

    In the following, we will apply the 
propose approach, which integrates the OFA, 
the HTGA and the robust stabilizability 
criterion, to design the robust-stable and 
quadratic-optimal static output feedback 
controller. In the OFA, the type of OF 
considered in this example is the 
shifted-Chebyshev functions. The 
evolutionary environments of the HTGA used 
in this example are: the population size is 30, 
the crossover rate is 0.7, the mutation rate is 
0.5, and the generation number is 30.
