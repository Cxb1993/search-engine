The nano Doughnut-like Copper periodic structure is fabricated by
an electro-plating method on patterned Ni template. The diameter
of the cover Cu doughnut hole can be controlled by a plating
duration. This structure can be applied in a biosensor due to
surface plasmonic resonance, and for novel optical device with
variable hole diameter and period of that array. The Magnetic
Force Microscope (MFM) was used for evaluating the bio-sensing
response under the addition of magnetic proteins (metallothionein-
MT, Mn2Cd5 Metallothionein-MMT, and Ferritin) on that sample
before and after magnetization. In addition, the optical properties
before and after magnetization were measured and scanned by
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It is noted that
some interesting behavior were observed in the spectra and
transmitting ratio under different polarization incident conditions.
Introduction
The controlled fabrication of periodic structures is important for materials and device
engineering. In particular, metal nanostructures are increasingly important building
blocks for new applications due to their shape- and lattice-dependent plasmon response
and a controllable optical and surface properties (1–2). Recently, noble metals, including
gold, silver, and copper, have increasingly been used to fabricate periodic nanostructures
(3). The periodic metal nanostructures are generally fabricated by nanoimprint (4), self-
assembly (5–9), and many kinds of template techniques, such as anodic alumina
membrane (10), colloidal-crystal nanoparticles (11), and etched-ion track (12). These
periodic nanostructures exhibit superior characteristics on surface plasmonics, excitation
(13), and polarization compared with random nanoparticles or nanoclusters. Cu is rarely
chosen as a periodic-array material because it is difficult to pattern by the dry-etching
process and it adheres poorly on the dielectric layer. The above-mentioned fabrication
methods can partially overcome dry etching and adhesion problems but are not easily
compatible with semiconductor manufacturing. Two kinds of copper interconnect
fabrications are extensively applied in interconnects and metal bumping: Cu-
electroplating and Cu-electroless deposition, respectively. Cu-electroless deposition is a
method to deposit Cu directly on the barrier layer such as Ta, TaN, Ti, TiN, W, NiB, or
AlN (14–19) by sensitization, activation, and a replacement process that possesses film
characteristics analogous to Cu-electroplating; but its chemical and physical properties
are still not superior to that of Cu-electroplating. Recently, a variety of liner materials as
a conductive layer and barrier layer for direct Cu-electroplating were examined, including
Pt, Pd, Ru, Os, and Ir, where the formation enthalpy of the metal oxide is smaller than
that of Cu oxide (20–24) Among these materials, Ni bears low electrical resistivity and
high thermal stability, and has a potential compatible with conventional silicon
These behaviors are very interesting and can probably be attributed to the magnetic
property of the additive. The additive of MT is not magnetic, but both MMT and Ferritin
are with magnetic moment. Therefore, we took the low temperature magnetized treatment
for those added protein samples to find further different phenomena. Following this, a
series of reflectance measurements were taken to check the difference between the
samples with and without magnetic additive. In the meantime, we can further study
whether the reflectance spectra of those samples with magnetic additive will change or
not after magnetization treatment.
Figure 4 show the reflectance spectra of the Ni-patterned template and the doughnut-like
Cu array under visible, near-IR, and Mid-IR incidence light. From those spectra, the
difference between the Cu and Ni samples response during all the range of incidence can
be clearly seen. This result means that the amplitudes and trend of the reflectance spectra
in both samples are different. Interestingly, all the spectra of protein-added samples could
be divided into two categories: one is similar with that of the Ni array sample, and
another being the same as the spectra of the Cu doughnut array sample; the spectra are
shown as Fig. 5, 6, and 7 under visible, near IR and mid IR incident, respectively. The
spectra in MT additive samples exhibited the same trend as that of the Ni array, with the
exception of a reflectance dip of 0.55 m; however, both the samples with additive of
Ferritin and MMT have the same behavior as that of the Cu doughnut array. The only
difference among MT, Ferritin, and MMT is that of the magnetic moment within. For MT
protein, there is no magnetic moment; however, there are magnetic moments existing for
both MMT and Ferritin protein. All the samples before protein is added are Cu doughnut
array, but exhibit a difference in behavior after the three kinds of proteins are added.
Therefore, we checked the morphology of added protein samples with the MFM tool and
found extremely different distributions for the added protein on Cu doughnut array
samples. The MT-added sample showed a different behavior than the other samples
under MMT and Ferritin addition. In the MT-added sample, the additive was deposited
along the boundary of the Cu doughnut, for which the composition is SiO2, with the
morphology as shown in Fig. 2. This figure is similar to that of Ni-patterned template,
shown as Fig. 2(c). However, in MMT- and Ferritin-added samples, the additives were
deposited directly on the Cu doughnut array body and almost not found on SiO2
boundaries, shown as Fig. 3(a) and (b). Thus, the spectra of the MT-added sample will
follow the original pattern and through the hollow array of Cu that just covered over the
Ni template. However, for MMT and Ferritin samples, the added protein was almost
filled on the doughnut body. The space between the doughnuts was empty without
occupying any MMT and Ferritin, thus permitting the incident light to transmit at about
0.55m, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). But for the MT case, it occupied almost the space
around the doughnut, so no light is permitted to pass this pattern and proves the spectra in
this region, as shown in Fig. 5(a).
In the meantime, the reflectance of MMT and Ferritin were higher than that of MT when
the incident light wavelength is beyond 1.3 m. A possible reason is due to the
morphology difference resulting in more scattering from rougher surface of both MMT-
and Ferritin-added samples. From the spectra above, we also found that the reflectance
value under S and P polarized light incident are higher than that of an unpolarized one
during some regions of incident wavelengths. Particularly, the case at a wavelength span
around 1.7 m is more obvious, in which the wavelength almost equals to the array
period. In general, the polarization dependence is weak for the circular array pattern

Experiment
The 3D copper PCs were fabricated by the copper interconnection process. In the first
step, a layer of 0.4-μm thick silicon oxide (SiOx) was deposited on asilicon substrate
(MULTIPLEX CLUSTER SYSTEM, STS), patterned (FPA-3000i5+ Stepper, Canon),
and etched (ILD-4100), to the top of substrate. Then, this mold was covered with the
0.03-μm thick tantalum and 0.05-μm thick copper seed layers bythe sputter deposition
(SBH-3308RDE Sputtering System, ULVAC), and filled with a copper film by the
process of copper electroplating (EP-802). The structure was then planarized for
removing excess copper and tantalum by the process of chemical mechanical polishing
(CMP, model 372M, Westech). The same processes were repeated layer-by-layer as
desired. At the end of the process, the SiOx mold was released from the whole structure
by the dilute hydrofluoric acid. The whole processing flow of the fabricated 3D copper
PCs is shown as Fig. 1. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) was used for the
morphology of 3D Cu PC observation. The PBG behaviors of the fabricated 3D woodpile
copper PCs weere investigated with the FTIR microscope (Hyperion 2000, Bruker) from
measuring the reflectance and transmittance spectra for one- to four-layer structures. The
reflectance and transmittance were obtained by normalizing the measured results taken
from the fabricated samples to that from the uniform gold mirror and the bare silicon
wafer, respectively. To verify the measurement results, the reflectance and transmittance
spectra were simulated by the 3D FDTD method with the boundary of perfectly matched
layers. The computational domain was divided into 600× 600× 300 grid points,
corresponding to 10 grid points per rod width w in the whole space. Two time monitors
placed in either side of the 3D woodpile PCs recorded the fields going through them to
obtain the reflectance and transmittance. In the simulation, the geometrical parameters
used were the same as the fabricated ones, and the wavelength-dependent refractive
indices were also used [7–9]. The tantalum layers were ignored because their thicknesses
were too thin.
Figure 1. Schematic procedure for the fabrication of the woodpile copper PCs.
Results and Discussion
The SEM images of the fabricated 3D copper PCs are shown in figure 2. The overall
sample area is 10 × 5 mm2. The frabricated structure is not an ideal fct lattice. The copper
According to the calculated photonic band structure, the band edge of the structure with
the geometrical parameters of w/h/d = 0.40/0.40/1.20 m, is located at a wavelength of
2.23 m. Therefore, we investigate this structure to obtain the optical property at near-
infrared wavelengths. Figure 3(a) shows the measured reflectance and transmittance
spectra as functions of the number of layers. The unpolarized incident light propagates
along z-direction. At wavelengths longer than 2.00 m, the magnitude of reflectance
raises when the number of layers increases. The transmittance reveals the opposite trend.
For the four-layer structure, the reflectance exhibits a dip at a wavelength of 1.72m and
some oscillations at wavelengths below 1.50 m. Correspondingly, the transmittance
shows a peak at a wavelength of 1.73 m, which agrees with the reflectance results.
Below 1.50 m, the measured signals are too low to be detected by the detector because
of the strong absorption by the silicon substrate. The measured band edge, which is
defined where the reflectance is 0.5, is located at a wavelength of 1.95m. In particular,
the reflectance dip at 1.72 m (or the transmission peak at 1.73 m) is close to the
waveguide cutoff wavelength 1.60 m, twice the air opening of 0.80 m. It is attributed
that the air open domain surrounded by the copper walls can be approximated to a
metallic square waveguide. Above the waveguide cutoff wavelength, only evanescent
waves are observed, resulting in such a large PBG.

with the measurement results, but the dip at 1.48 m has not been observed from the
experimental data. In the 3D woodpile metallic PCs, a reflectance dip correspond to
transmission and absorption peaks. The propagating mode at the lowest frequency may
originate from the waveguide cutoff effect. The cutoff wavelengthcutoff is determined by
the relation cutoff≈ 2lopen nf , where the lopen and nf are the length and refractive index of
the open domain, respectively. For the higher-frequency propagating modes, they still
approximately follow the linear scaling law with respect to nf for a perfectly conducting
structure [12].
Figure 4. Simulated reflectance and transmittance spectra of the 3D copper PCs of the
same dimensions with fabricated one. (a)-(b) The normal incident light is unpolarized.
The normal incident light is (c) s-polarized and (d) p-polarized.
In order to examine this scalability, the 3D woodpile copper PCs before the release of
SiOx mold were measured to check the position shifts of the reflectance dips. In this
configuration, the filling material in the 3D copper PCs was changed from air to SiOx as
shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, there appears several reflectance dips for the 3D woodpile PCs
with the SiOx mold. Here we take the first to the third dips for discussion and label them
as 1, 2and 3. The positions of the three dips for the 3D copper PCs with the filling
material of air are located at wavelengths λ1 = 1.72 μm, λ2 = 1.19 μm, and λ3 =0.92 μm,
respectively. With the increase of the refractive index from 1.00 (air) to 1.45(SiOx), these
