and mechanical characteristics 
membrane can be obtained by solution 
casting from high boiling polar organic 
solvents, and removing the solvent by 
vacuum heating around 20oC below its 
boiling point [5,8-11]. 
 It has been reported the 
micro-structure of block copolymers can 
be aligned using an electric field [12,13]. 
In this paper, we show that the proton 
conductivity of Nafion membranes can 
be improved by aligning the 
nano-structure of –SO3H groups 
aggregations using an electric field 
along the membrane thickness direction, 
which causes linear, less curved, and 
continuous proton transferring pathways. 
The membranes were prepared by 
solution casing from an organic solvent, 
i.e. N,N’-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc). 
The solvent was vacuum dried at 50oC, 
which was below glass transition 
temperature Tg of Nafion, and then the 
membrane was annealed and applied 
with an electric field at ~20oC above Tg 
of Nafion (the Tg of Nafion is around 
~100oC). 
In this section, we review literature 
reports on the molecular structures of 
Nafion in solutions as well as in 
membranes. Small angle neutron 
scattering (SANS), small angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS), electron spin 
resonance (ESR), and dynamic light 
scattering (DLS) experiments have 
given an insight into the structure of 
Nafion colloid dilute solutions [14-20]. 
The SANS, SAXS, and ESR 
experimental results indicate a compact 
cylinder structure of Nafion in alcohol 
and aqueous solutions, in which several 
Nafion molecules aggregate through 
perfluorocarbon backbone hydrophobic 
interactions and form cylinders with 
ionic side chains surrounding the 
surfaces of cylinders. This degree of 
perfluorocarbon backbone hydrophobic 
aggregations increases with increasing 
dielectric constant of solvents and 
decreasing solubility of perfluorocarbon 
backbone in solvents. DLS experiments 
revealed two different sizes of Nafion 
aggregates in solutions. The smaller 
sizes aggregates were attributed to the 
primary hydrophobic interactions of 
fluorocarbon backbones, which had a 
cylinder-like structure with ionic side 
chains surrounding the surfaces of 
cylinders, and the larger sizes aggregates 
were attributed to the secondary 
electrostatic attraction of primary 
cylinder-like structures through the side 
chain sulfonic ion pairs [19, 20]. 
 The structures of Nafion 
membranes had also been investigated 
using SAXS and SANS [21-33]. Three 
structure models have been proposed. 
The first two structure models, i.e. 
cluster and layer structure models, 
appeared in literature in early 1980s 
[22,30]. The clusters models proposed 
that electrostatic interactions hold the 
ionic groups in regions that are roughly 
spherical in shape and on the order of 
nano meters in size and spacing [22-29]. 
The layered model proposed layered 
structures of very thin crystalline regions 
whose surfaces are covered with ionic 
groups [30,31]. However, the cluster 
model can not account two small angle 
scattering experimental behaviors (i.e, 
scattering vectors q around ~0.05 A-1 
and ~0.15A-1 for crystalline and cluster 
regions, respectively), i.e. (1) a linear 
relationship exists between the shift in 
the position of ionic cluster scattering 
peak of SAXS and SANS and the 
volume fraction of water, φw, swollen in 
membranes [17,18] and (2) the Porod 
behavior of SAXS and SANS indicates 
that total surface area in water swollen 
membranes is independent of the water 
volume fraction [29]. The layered model 
lacks of accounting ability for the 
observed upturn in SAXS and SANS 
intensity at very low scattering angles, 
and also lacks of agreement between the 
solvent-induced-shift dependency of the 
ionic regions and crystalline scattering 
peaks. A third structure model was

water and dried at room temperature. 
The stained films were embedded in an 
epoxy resin (embedding media cat. 
#14300, Spurr Co, PA) and microtomed 
with a diamond knife for TEM 
experiments. 
2.5. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)--- 
A soft contact mode AFM (Shimazu, 
Model SPM 9500J2) was used to 
observe the surface of three Nafion films, 
with one film not treated with an electric 
field, another was treated with an 
electric field parallel to the surface of 
the film, the another one was treated 
with an electric field vertical to the 
surface of the film. The cantilever was 
NSC 12/50 silicon (Olympus, 
OMCL-TR400PSA-3) with a tip radius 
of 5-10 nm. 
2.6. Polyelectrolyte membrane fuel cell 
(PEMFC) performance test--- The 
Nafion membranes purchased from 
DuPont Co, i.e. Nafion-117, and 
membranes prepared in this work were 
used to prepare membrane electrode 
assemblies (MEAs). The gas diffusion 
layer of MEA was a carbon paper (Toray 
Co) pretreated with FEP resin (DuPont 
Co). The Pt/C catalyst content of anode 
was 1.0 mg/cm2 and that of cathode was 
0.5 mg/cm2. The performances of single 
cells were tested at 70oC using a Globe 
Tech Computer Cell GT testing system 
(Electrochem Inc). Both the anode H2 
input and the cathode O2 input flow rates 
were 200 ml/min. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 In the process of polymer 
crystallization, the polymer should be 
annealed at a temperature between Tg 
and Tm (crystalline melting temperature) 
to let the polymer molecular chains have 
proper energy to move and pack to form 
crystalline. Similar to polymer 
crystallization, in order to align the 
microstructures of Nafion membranes 
by applying an electric field, one should 
keep the molecules to have proper 
mobility to move along the electric field 
direction. Thus annealing the amorphous 
membranes at a temperature between Tg 
and Tm of polymer while applying an 
electric field on the membranes is 
necessary for nano-structure alignment. 
Once the polymers are in crystalline 
state, the high viscosity of polymers 
causes the molecular chains not easy to 
move and be aligned along the electric 
field while they are annealed at a 
temperature between Tg and Tm. In this 
work, Nafion membranes were prepared 
from DMAC solution and the solvent 
was evaporated at 60oC under vacuum, 
thus the polymer was in amorphous state 
before annealing and applying with an 
electric field at a temperature above Tg. 
 Figure 1 shows the TEM 
micrograph of a Nafion membrane after 
annealing at 120oC for 30 min, which 
was not applied with an electric field. In 
the micrograph, the dark sites are ionic 
aggregations, which were stained with 
Pb(NO3)2 solution, and the gray or 
bright sites are the aggregates of Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones, which were 
not stained with Pb(NO3)2 solution. The 
degree of darkness of ionic aggregations 
sites in TEM micrograph depends 
on –SO3H group aggregation density 
and the deepness of the ionic group 
aggregations below the film surface. The 
higher –SO3H group aggregation density 
and the closer ionic aggregations to the 
film surface, the darker the ionic 
aggregations sites will be shown in TEM 
micrograph. For Nafion membranes 
prepared without applying an electric 
field, the fibrillar-like perfluorocarbon 
backbone aggregates should distribute in 
random orientations in the membranes. 
As shown in Figure 1, the oblate or 
round shape dark ionic aggregations 
disperse randomly among the gray 
perfluorocarbon backbone aggregation 
regions. The total area of dark regions is 
slightly less than that of the gray 
perfluorocarbon backbone aggregation 
regions. The shapes of dark sites are 
oblate or round. The oblates dark sites

microstructure of dried Nafion 
membranes using AFM. Figs. 4, 5, and 6 
show the AFM micrographs of the 
surface of Nafion membranes prepared 
by solution casting without treatment 
with an electric field, after treatment 
with an electric field parallel to the 
surface of membrane, and after 
treatment with an electric field vertical 
to the surface of membrane. The 
packings of fibril bundles with diameter 
closing to 100 nm are clearly seen in 
these micrographs. Fig. 4 shows the 
packings of fibrils bundles of dried 
Nafion membranes without treatment 
with an electric field were randomly 
distributed. Fig. 5 shows the packing 
fibrils bundles was aligned along the 
surface of a dried Nafion membrane. 
However, comparing with Figure 4 and 
5, the packing of bundles was not clearly 
observed in Figure 6, due to the bundles 
of fibrils were oriented normal to the 
membrane surface. 
 Table 1 shows the proton 
conductivity data of a commercial 
Nafion-117 (Du Pont) and three 
membranes prepared in this work by 
solution casting from DMAc solvent. 
The DMAc solvent of casting solutions 
was evaporated at 50oC under vacuum 
for 30 h and then at 60oC under vacuum 
for 1 h. One of these membranes was 
then annealed at 120oC for 30 min 
without applying an electric field. 
Another one was annealed at 120oC for 
30 min with an electric field (7.5 kVcm-1) 
applied vertically to the surface of the 
membrane. The other one was annealed 
at 120oC for 30 min with an electric 
field (7.5 kVcm-1) applied parallel to the 
surface of the membrane. Before 
conductivity measurements, the 
membrane were swollen with 1 N 
sulfuric acid at room temperature for 24 
hr. Comparing the conductivity data of 
these membranes, we found that the 
conductivity of a membrane after 
applying an electric field vertical to the 
membrane surface (i.e. electric field was 
along the membrane thickness direction) 
was improved and was higher than the 
coductivities of other membranes. 
 Summarizing our TEM and AFM 
micrograph results and proton 
conductivity data with the fibril-like 
structure model suggested by Rubatat et 
al [32,33], we propose microstructure 
models of Nafion membranes prepared 
by solution casting and annealing at 
120oC for 30 min without applying an 
electric field (Fig. 7) and with applying 
an electric field (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) on 
the membranes. The rods in Figures 7~9 
are aggregates of fibrils, which have 
diameters of 1~2 nm and are elongated 
polymeric aggregates surrounded with 
the ionic charges. The packing of 
bundles of fibrils aggregates may 
contain 25~50 fibrils aggregates and 
with diameters around 50~100 nm for a 
dry membrane. These bundles packing 
may dissociate into smaller sizes 
bundles containing less fibrils 
aggregates after swelling with water. For 
fuel cells applications, the Nafion 
membranes may contain 25~40 vol% 
(13~ 23 wt%) of water. Thus the 
diameters of bundles are smaller than 50 
nm and decrease with increasing water 
content. 
 From TEM micrographs results, it 
is obvious that applying an electric field 
(Z-direction in Fig. 9) along the 
membrane thickness direction during 
annealing at 120oC will cause Nafion 
fibrils to be aligned along the membrane 
thickness direction (Fig. 9). The pendant 
side chain –SO3H groups, which are 
located surrounding the surfaces of 
fibrils, are all also aligned along the 
membrane thickness direction. Thus the 
contour lengths for ions transferring 
across the cross section of a membrane 
(thick line in Fig. 9), i.e. along the 
membrane thickness direction, are the 
same as the membrane thickness. If the 
electric field is applied vertical to the 
membrane thickness direction (i.e. 
electric field is parallel to the membrane
