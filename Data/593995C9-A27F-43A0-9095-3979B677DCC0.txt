Abstract
Keywords: zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence, low correlation zone (LCZ) sequence,
quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QS-CDMA), approximately synchronous
code-division multiple-access (AS-CDMA), Boolean functions.
Recently, a new class of sequences with zero correlation zone (ZCZ) or low correlation zone
(LCZ) has attracted increasing interests in the academia and industry. They can be used
as spreading sequences in quasi-synchronous (QS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA)
systems or approximately synchronous (AS) CDMA systems to eliminate both the multiple-
access interference and multipath interference. Most of the constructions of ZCZ or LCZ
sequences are based on other special sequences. Almost no or few direct constructions have
been proposed so far. In this report, we investigate direct constructions of ZCZ and LCZ
sequences from a coding theoretical perspective.
In this report, several new methods for constructing ZCZ or LCZ sequence sets from
the generalized Boolean functions are proposed. These methods are all direct constructions
without the requirement of any special sequences or pre-search sequences and the procedures
are with low complexity. The proposed methods can freely choose the sequence length, the
length of ZCZ or LCZ, the set size, and the number of phases as a tradeoff. Compared with
previous methods, the length of ZCZ in our methods is pretty large and the length of the
ZCZ can be close to the theoretical bound. Besides, the length of LCZ sequences in our
method is a power of two and constructions for this length were not found before.

matrices.
Most of the previous constructions of LCZ sequence sets were focused on sequence length
pn− 1, for a prime p [2], [25]–[33]. Recently, several constructions of LCZ sequence sets with
even sequence length were proposed. However, most of the constructions of LCZ sequence
sets are based on other special sequences, such as m-sequences [28], [34] or based on given
LCZ sequence sets [28], [35], [36]. So far, almost no or few direct constructions of LCZ
sequence sets with even sequence length have been proposed.
In this report, we propose several new methods for constructing ZCZ sequences based on
the Boolean functions. Based on the constructions, ZCZ sequence sets of different sequence
length, set size, length of the ZCZ, and constellation size can be easily obtained. Furthermore,
the length of ZCZ achieves or almost achieves the upper bound in [37]. We call those ZCZ
sequence sets optimal or almost optimal, respectively. In addition, optimal ZCZ sequence
sets with every sequence as perfect sequence can be obtained from the proposed constructions
with some specific parameters. Moreover, we generalize these results to LCZ sequence sets.
The constructions are also direct constructions based on Boolean functions. Three different
constructions are provided and the sequence length of the constructed LCZ sequence sets
is 2n. In particular, the first one provides LCZ sequence sets consisting of a pair of ZCZ
sequence sets. ZCZ sequence sets can also be obtained from the third construction by specific
parameter setting. Low-complexity encoding of the constructed ZCZ and LCZ sequence sets
can also be obtained due to the structure of Boolean functions.
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we give the defini-
tions of ZCZ and LCZ sequences, some notations, and the background which will be used
throughout this report. We then introduce some related work in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4,
we propose the direct constructions of ZCZ sequence sets from generalized Boolean func-
tions which are generalized from [23]. In Chapter 5, we propose direct constructions of LCZ

Background and Definitions
2.1 Zero and Low Correlation Zone Sequences
Let S be an L-length sequence set of M sequences and represented as
S = {s0, s1, s2, . . . , sk, . . . , sM−1}
where
sk = (sk,0, sk,1, sk,2, . . . , sk,i, . . . , sk,L−1)
for k = 0, 1, . . . ,M − 1 and i = 0, 1, . . . , L− 1.
For two complex-valued L-length sequences, a = (a0, a1, . . . , aL−1) and b = (b0, b1, . . . , bL−1),
the periodic cross-correlation function of a and b at a shift value τ is defined by
Ra,b(τ) =
L−1∑
t=0
at⊕Lτb
∗
t , 0 ≤ |τ | < L
where ⊕L is modulo-L addition and (·)∗ denotes complex conjugation. It is clear that
Ra,b(τ) = R
∗
b,a(−τ). When a = b, Ra,a(τ) is called the periodic autocorrelation function of
a. In this case, we write Ra,a(τ) = Ra(τ) for simplicity.
For any Zq-valued sequence a of length L, we associate a complex-valued sequence A =
(A0, A1, . . . , AL−1) with a, where Ai = ξai , 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1, and ξ is a complex qth root of
4
Hence, we define a merit figure as
ηL =
√
L
δ2
MZ − L
MZ − 1
for evaluating an LCZ sequence set with MZ > L, and another one as
ηZ =
MZ
L
for evaluating a ZCZ sequence set. However, in the binary ZCZ case, the upper bound is
expected to be given by the following formula [38]:
Zb ≤ L
2M
+ 1. (2.3)
So the merit figure for binary ZCZ sequence set is given by
ηZ,b =
2M(Z − 1)
L
.
Definition 2.3. A ZCZ sequence set with parameters (M,L,Z) is said to be optimal if
Z = (L/M) and almost optimal if Z = (L/M)− 1.
Note that this definition of optimality is in a much stronger sense than that of requiring
the ratio MZ/L to approach one asymptotically and any almost optimal ZCZ sequence set
can achieve MZ/L ≥ 1−M/L ≈ 1 for large L.
Definition 2.4. A sequence a = {a0, a1, a2, . . . , aL−1} of length L is said to be a perfect
sequence if Ra(τ) = 0 for 0 < |τ | < L.
The perfect sequence can be considered as a special case of a ZCZ sequence set which
has only one sequence with parameters (1, L, L).
2.2 Generalized Boolean Functions
A Boolean function f is a function of m variables x1, x2, . . . , xm from Zm2 to Z2. We regard
each 0 − 1 variable as itself being a Boolean function and define the monomial of degree r

2.3 Generalized Reed-Muller Codes
Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are probably one of the oldest and best understood families
of codes [39], and can be easily represented by the Boolean function. In the binary case,
q = 2, the rth-order Reed-Muller code RM(r,m) of length 2m is defined to be the binary
code whose codewords are the sequences corresponding to the Boolean functions of degree
at most r in x1, x2, . . . , xm. The code RM(r,m) is linear, has minimum Hamming distance
2m−r, and has a generator matrix whose rows are the words corresponding to the distinct
monomials in x1, x2, . . . , xm of degree at most r.
The generalized rth-order RM codes [40] of length 2m, denoted by RMq(r,m) where
q ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ r ≤ m, is defined to be the linear code over Zq that is generated by the
Zq-valued sequences corresponding to the monomials of degree at most r in x1, x2, . . . , xm.
The codewords of RMq(r,m) will also be the Boolean functions of degree at most r in
x1, x2, . . . , xm where the coefficient belongs to Zq. Alternatively, RMq(r,m) is the linear code
over Zq whose generator matrix is formally identical to that of the binary code RM(r,m).

where λτ ∈ Zq and (τ1, τ2, . . . , τm) is the binary representation of τ . Next, we denote the
corresponding graph of m vertices for the Boolean function c by G(c). The vertices are
labeled by 1, 2, . . . ,m and we say that vertices i and j are adjacent by an edge labeled by
λτ if there exists the term λτxixj in c with λτ ̸= 0.
We denote a path generated by a set of vertices I = {i1, i2, . . . , ik} and a bijection pi from

respectively. Taking m = 4 as example, there are two paths P ({2}, pi1) and P ({1, 3, 4}, pi2)
in the graph given in Figure 2.1.

θ(piα(β)) > θ(piα(β + 1)) for 1 ≤ α ≤ k and 1 ≤ β ≤ mα − 1. We define Γr(θ, pi1, pi2, . . . , pik)

Construction Procedure
Let L = 2n + 1− 2, a be a binary m-sequence of period 2n − 1.
Step 1: Generate the characteristic set of a with cyclic shift u ∈ Z2n−1 which is defined
as
Du = {t|at−u = 1, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2n − 2}.
Step 2: Construct Cu from Du, such that
Cu = {i| i ∈ Au and i is even} ∪ {i+ L/2| i ∈ Au and i is odd}
∪{i| i ∈ D−u and i is odd} ∪ {i+ L/2| i ∈ D−u and i is even}
where Au can be either Du or D¯u.
Step 3: Let su be the characteristic sequence of Cu such that
su,t =
{
1, for t ∈ Cu
0, otherwise.
Let the set U1 be the collection of all the characteristic sequences su, 1 ≤ u ≤ 2n − 1,
of Cu with Au = Du. Similarly, let the set U2 be the collection of all the characteristic
sequences su, 1 ≤ u ≤ 2n − 1, of Cu with Au = D¯u.
Step 4: Choose an index set I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , 2n − 1} to construct a good binary LCZ
sequence set
WI = {su ∈ U1|u ∈ I} ∪ {su ∈ U2|u ∈ I}
with parameters (M, 2n+1 − 2, Z, 2).
Constructions of Index Set I
(i) Pick an odd integer f and a nonnegative integer f0 < f . We make an index set I as
I =
{
f0 +mf |m = 1, 2, . . . ,
⌊

f
⌋}

Given a sequence s = {s0, s1, . . . , sL−1} with period L, a sequence ω = {ω0, ω1, . . . , ωP−1}
of length P with |ωi| = 1, 0 ≤ i < P , a shift sequence e = {e0, e1, . . . , eP−1} where 0 ≤
ei < L, 0 ≤ i < P , we construct a new sequence a with period NP using the interleaving
technique, that is,
aiP = ω0si+e0 , aiP+1 = ω1si+e1 , . . . , aiP+P−1 = ωP−1si+eP−1
for i = 0, 1 . . . , L − 1. Let a(s,ω, e) denote the interleaved sequence a associated with
(s,ω, e).
Construction Procedure
First, we set integers P , Z, L and M with the following relationship.
(i) If P |Z, then
M =
⌊
L− P − σ
Z
⌋
where
σ =
{
0, if P = 2 or Z|L− 1
1, otherwise.
(ii) If P is even and Z ≡ P/2 (mod P ), then
M =
⌊
L− 3P/2 + 1− σ
Z
⌋
where
σ =
{
0, if P = 2 or 4
1, otherwise.
Step 1: Generate an appropriate shift sequence set E of size M written as
E = {e0, e1, . . . , ei, . . . , eM−1}
ei = (ei,0, ei,1, . . . , ei,p−1), i = 0, 1, . . . ,M − 1
16
and
ei,j+P/2 =
{
(j + 1)(M(2q + 1) + 2) + δj+1 − 1− q − (2q + 1)i/2, if i is even
j(M(2q + 1) + 2) + δj + (2q + 1)(i− 1)/2 + q + 1, if i is odd
If Z|L− 2 or P = 2, let
ei,j =
{
(2q + 1)i/2, if i is even
L− (2q + 1)(i+ 1)/2, if i is odd
and
ei,j+P/2 =
{
L− q − (2q + 1)i/2, if i is even
(2q + 1)(i− 1)/2 + q + 1, if i is odd.
3.2 Extension Constructions from Given LCZ Sequence
Sets
In [28] and [36], several methods for constructing an LCZ sequence set based on a known
LCZ sequence set were proposed. We review them in this section.
3.2.1 Method I
Let A be a q-ary LCZ sequence set with even q and parameters (M,L,Z, δ) given as
A = {ai|0 ≤ i ≤M − 1, 0 ≤ t ≤ L− 1}.
We use A to construct a new LCZ sequence set U1. Let U1 be a q-ary LCZ sequence set
given as
U1 = {si|0 ≤ i ≤ 2M − 1, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2N − 1}
where si is defined as
si,2t =
{
ai,t, for 0 ≤ i ≤M − 1
ai−M,t + q/2, for M ≤ i ≤ 2M − 1
si,2t+1 =
{
ai,t+⌈Z2 ⌉, for 0 ≤ i ≤M − 1
ai−M,t+⌈Z2 ⌉, for M ≤ i ≤ 2M − 1.
18
Theorem 3.4. Given an even integer L, let A be a binary LCZ sequence set with parameters
(M,L,Z, δ). Let Zh be a low correlation zone around the phase L/2 including the phase L/2.
Define the sequence set G as follows
G = {gi|0 ≤ i ≤ 2M}
where
gi,t =
{
φ[ai,t, ai,t+L/2], for 0 ≤ i < M
φ[ai−M,t, ai−M,t+L/2 ⊕2 1], for M ≤ i < 2M.
Then G is a quaternary LCZ sequence set with parameters (2M,L,min{Z,Zh}, δ).
20
overflow, then ih = 0, jh = 1; il = 1 and jl = 0 for z ≤ l ≤ h− 1; il = jl for h+ 1 ≤ l ≤ m.
Proof. Let (u1, u2, . . . , um) be the binary representation of u, then ul = 0 for z + 1 ≤ l ≤ m
since u = 2z−1. When i ⊕n u, the addition of kth bit for z + 1 ≤ k ≤ m is only effected by
the carrier, then we can get the result.
Lemma 4.2. For any positive integer m, k0, k1 with k0 < k1 < m, let z = 2
k1 − 2k0, i.e.,
zl = 1 for k0 < l ≤ k1; otherwise, zl = 0. For any integer u ≤ z and any positive integer
0 ≤ i < 2m, let n = 2m and j = i ⊕n u. If there exists an integer p with k1 < p ≤ m, such
that ip ̸= jp, then there exists an integer q with k0 < q ≤ k1, such that iq ̸= jq.
Proof. Suppose there exist integer k1 < p ≤ m such that ip ̸= jp and ip = jp for k0 < q ≤ k1;
then let u′ = j ⊖n i. We can have u′ > z and it contradicts the assumption that u ≤ z.
4.2 Theorems of ZCZ Sequences from Generalized Boolean
Functions
First of all, we provide the basic construction of the ZCZ sequence set from Boolean functions.
Theorem 4.1. For any positive integer m, k, z, q, q0 such that z ≤ k, m ≥ k + z, and
q = q02
z, let nonempty sets I1, I2, . . . , Ik be a partition of I where I = Nm−z, mα = |Iα|, piα
be a bijection from Nmα to Iα such that m− k − z + 1 ≤ piα(1) ≤ m− k for α = 1, 2, . . . , z
and piα(1) = m− α + 1 for α = z + 1, z + 2, . . . , k. Let θ be a bijection from Nm−z to Nm−z
such that θ(piα(β)) > θ(piα(β+1)) for 1 ≤ α ≤ k and 1 ≤ β ≤ mα− 1. Consider a Zq-valued

where −ρ = ρ since ρ ∈ {0, q/2}. Since ipit(1) = jpit(1) for αˆ + 1 ≤ t ≤ z and im−z+αˆ =
jm−z+αˆ, we have
aj − ai − aj′ + ai′ = q02z−1(ipiαˆ(1) − jpiαˆ(1)) =
q
2
.
Since m− z+ αˆ /∈ I and bi′ − bi = 0, we have bj − bi− bj′ + bi′ = 0. Therefore, we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = aj − ai − aj′ + ai′ = q
2
since ipiα(mα) = jpiα(mα) for 1 ≤ α ≤ k.
(ii) If im−z+αˆ ̸= jm−z+αˆ, we suppose im−z+αˆ = 0 and jm−z+αˆ = 1. Let i′ = i ⊕n 2m−z+αˆ−1
and j′ = j ⊕n 2m−z+αˆ−1, and then i′m−z+αˆ = 1, j′m−z+αˆ = 0. Also let 0 < h2 ≤ z be
the largest integer such that j′m−z+h2 ̸= jm−z+h2 . Then jm−z+l = 1, j′m−z+l = 0 for
αˆ ≤ l < h2. If αˆ > 1, we have

Since γ ∈ LC(Ω(Nm−z)) and il = i′l, jl = j′l for 0 < l ≤ m − z, we have bi′ − bi =
bj′ − bj = 0. Hence bj − bi − bj′ + bi′ = 0. Then we can have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Now, we consider im−z+αˆ = 1 and jm−z+αˆ = 0. Let i′ = i ⊖n 2m−z+αˆ−1 and j′ =
j ⊖n 2m−z+αˆ−1. Similarly, we can have
ej − fi − ej′ + fj′ = q
2
.
From these two cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such
that
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0
which implies Re,f (τ) = 0.
Then in the second part, we will show that for e ̸= f
Re,f (0) =
n−1∑
i=0
ξei−fi = 0.
For any integer 0 ≤ i < n, let (i1, i2, . . . , im) be the binary representations of i, e = cl1 and
f = cl2 . Also let h3, where 1 ≤ h3 ≤ k be the smallest integer such that sl1,h3−1 − sl2,h3−1 =
q/2. Let i′ be the integers that is different from i with only one position pih3(mh3), i.e.,
i′pih3 (mh3) = 1− ipih3 (mh3 ). We can have
fi′ − ei′ =
k∑
α=1
(sl2,α−1 − sl1,α−1)i′piα(mα).
Therefore,
ei − fi − ei′ + fi′ = (sl2,h3−1 − sl1,h3−1)(1− 2ipih3 (mh3 )) =
q
2
.
Hence, we have Re,f (0) = 0.

The associated graph of the Boolean function Q given in Theorem 4.1 is depicted in
Figure 4.1, where there are m vertices and k paths.
The following two lemmas provide explicit methods to construct the set S needed in
Theorem 4.1.
Lemma 4.3. For any positive integer k and even integer q, let n = 2k. If the Zq-valued
sequence set S with n sequences of length k satisfies that the t-th element of the sequence
si = (si,0, si,1, . . . , si,k−1) is given by
si,t =
q
2
it+1
for i = 0, 1, . . . , n−1 and t = 0, 1, . . . , k−1 where {i1, i2, . . . , ik} is the binary representation
of i, then there exists a nonnegative integer l ≤ k such that si,l−sj,l = q/2 for 0 ≤ i < j < 2k.
Example 4.1. From Lemma 4.3, for k = 3, q = 8, we can have
s0 = (0 0 0)
s1 = (4 0 0)
s2 = (0 4 0)
s3 = (4 4 0)
s4 = (0 0 4)
s5 = (4 0 4)
s6 = (0 4 4)
s7 = (4 4 4).
Lemma 4.4. For any positive integers k and q0, let n = 2
k, q = q02
k and pi be a bijection
from {0, 1, . . . , k − 1} to {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}. Let a Zq-valued sequence set S with n sequences
of length k satisfy that the pi(t)-th element of the sequence s = (si,0, si,1, . . . , si,k−1) is given

set C = {c0, c1, . . . , c7} where

for i = 0, 1, . . . , 7 where ρ ∈ {0, 2}, λl ∈ Z4 for 0 ≤ l ≤ 18 and (i1, i2, i3) is the binary
representation of i. The associated graph of ci is depicted in Figure 4.2. Then C is a ZCZ
sequence set with parameters (8, 256, 25) which has merit figure ηZ = 0.469.
By giving some specific parameters, some special ZCZ sequence sets can be obtained from
Theorem 4.1, as shown in the following corollary.
Corollary 4.2. We follow the notations in Theorem 4.1.
32
where n = 22z, e = (e0, e1, . . . , en−1) and f = (f0, f1, . . . , fn−1). We also show that Re(τ) = 0
for 0 < τ ≤ 22z − 1. For any nonnegative integer i < n, let j = i⊕n τ ; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im)
and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i and j, respectively. We can divide Q
into 2 terms as Q = a+ b where
a = q0

and
b = ω.
Let a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) and b = (b0, b1, . . . , bn−1) be the corresponding sequences of a and
b, respectively.
Case 1: Suppose there exists an integer l with 1 ≤ l ≤ z such that il ̸= jl. Then similar
to Case 2 in the proof of Theorem 4.1, we can find one-to-one correspondence i′ and j′ such
that
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Case 2: Suppose il = jl for 1 ≤ l ≤ z. Let 1 ≤ αˆ ≤ z be the smallest integer such that
iz+αˆ ̸= jz+αˆ. Then we let i′ and j′ be the integers that are different from i and j, respectively,
with only one position pi(αˆ). We have
ai′ − ai = q0(1− 2ipi(αˆ))

Since iz+w = jz+w for 1 ≤ w ≤ αˆ− 1, we have

Since il = jl for l ∈ Nz,

Figure 4.3: Associated graph of the function Q in Theorem 4.3 when ρ = 0 and ω = 0.
In Theorem 4.3, there is a tradeoff between set size and length of ZCZ. Figure 4.3 shows
the associated graph of the Boolean function Q given in Theorem 4.3, where there are 2z
vertices and no paths. Note that the constellation size grows as the sequence length increases.
Example 4.4. Let m = 6, k = 2, z = 3, q = 8, pi(1) = 1, pi(2) = 2, pi(3) = 3, and then
according to the construction of Theorem 4.3, the Boolean function Q is given by
Q = (4x1x4 + 4x2x5 + 2x2x4 + 4x3x6 + 2x3x5 + x3x4) + ρx4 + ω
where ρ ∈ {0, 2} and ω ∈ LC(Ω(Nz)). We can obtain Ω(Nz) = {1, x1, x2, x3, x1x2, x1x3,
x2x3, x1x2x3}. With the sequence set S generated by Lemma 4.3, we have the ZCZ sequence
set C = {c0, c1, c2, c3} where
ci = (4x1x4 + 4x2x5 + 2x2x4 + 4x3x6 + 2x3x5 + x3x4) + ρx4

where ρ ∈ {0, q/2}, γ ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, . . . , pik)) and ω ∈ LC(Ω(I0)). For a Zq-valued
sequence set S of 2k sequences and of length k, if there exists a nonnegative integer l < k
with si,l − sj,l = q/2 for 0 ≤ i < j < 2k, we let
ci = Q+

α=1
si,α−1xpiα(mα)
and C = {c0, c1, . . . , c2k−1} where ci is the corresponding sequence of ci for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1.
Then C is a ZCZ sequence set with parameters (2k, 2m, 2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1 + 1).
Proof. In the first part, we demonstrate that Re,f (τ) = 0 for e,f ∈ C and 0 < τ ≤
2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1, i.e.,
n−1∑
i=0
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi = 0
where n = 2m, e = (e0, e1, . . . , en−1) and f = (f0, f1, . . . , fn−1). For any integer 0 ≤ i < n,
let j = i ⊕n u; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i
and j, respectively. Let h0 be the largest integer such that ih0 ̸= jh0 .
Case 1: Suppose h0 ≤ m − k − z0 − z1, and then let h1 with 1 ≤ h1 ≤ m − k − z0 − z1
and ih1 ̸= jh1 be the integer that maximum θ(h1). Since h1 ∈ I, there exist αˆ and βˆ with
1 ≤ αˆ ≤ k and 2 ≤ βˆ ≤ mαˆ such that piαˆ(βˆ) = h1. We let i′ and j′ be the integers that are
38
We let i′ and j′ be the integers that are different from i and j, respectively, with only one
position pi0(αˆ). Then we have

Since il = jl for m− z1 + 1 ≤ l ≤ m and ipiw(1) = jpiw(1) for 1 ≤ w ≤ αˆ− 1, we have
aj − ai − aj′ + ai′ = q02z1−1(ipiαˆ(1) − jpiαˆ(1)) =
q

.
Since pi0(αˆ) /∈ I, bi′ − bi = λpi0(αˆ)(1− 2ipi0(αˆ)). And since ipi0(αˆ) = jpi0(αˆ), we have bj − bi− bj′ +
bi′ = 0. Therefore, we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = aj − ai − aj′ + ai′ = q

sponding sequences of a, b and d, respectively. Let nˆ = k + z0 + z1, iˆ = i/2
m−nˆ and
jˆ = j/2m−nˆ, i.e., iˆ is the quotient of i divided by 2m−nˆ and jˆ is the quotient of j divided by

(i) If iˆαˆ = jˆαˆ, then iˆl = 0 and jˆl = 1 for 0 < l < αˆ. Therefore,

(ii) If iˆαˆ ̸= jˆαˆ, then there exists a positive integer h4 < αˆ such that iˆh4 = 1 and jˆh4 = 0.
So iˆl = 0, jˆl = 1 for 0 < l < h4 and iˆl = jˆl for h4 < l < αˆ. We have

il = jl for l ∈ I0 , we can obtain
dj − di − dj′ + di′ = ωj − ωi − ωj′ + ωi′ = 0.
Therefore, we have

where ρ ∈ {0, q/2}, γ ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, . . . , pik)) and ω ∈ LC(Ω(I0)). For a Zq-valued se-
quence set S of 2k sequences of length k, if there exists a nonnegative integer l < k satisfying
that si,l − sj,l = q/2 for 0 ≤ i < j < 2k, we let
ci = Q+
k∑
α=1
si,α−1xpiα(mα)
and C = {c0, c1, . . . , c2k−1} where ci is the corresponding sequence of ci for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1.
Then C is a ZCZ sequence set with parameters (2k, 2m, 2m−k − 2m−z0−2z1+1 + 1).
Proof. In the first part, we demonstrate that Re,f (τ) = 0 for e,f ∈ C and 0 < τ ≤

let j = i ⊕n u; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i

that are different from i and j with only one position pi0(z1 − k + αˆ). Then similar to Case
4 in the proof of Theorem 4.4, we can have ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q/2.
From these four cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such
that
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0
which implies Re,f (τ) = 0.
Then in the second part, for e ̸= f and τ = 0, similar to the second part int the proof of
Theorem 4.1 we can have
Re,f (0) =
2m−1∑
i=0
ξei−fi = 0
which completes the proof.
Compared to Theorem 4.4, the parameter k in Theorem 4.6 can be smaller than z1. With
the same constellation size, the ZCZ is larger but the set size is smaller. If we set k = z1,
Theorem 4.6 reduces to a form of Theorem 4.4. In Figure 4.7, the graph illustrates the
associated graph of the Boolean function Q given in Theorem 4.6.
By setting some specific parameters in Theorem 4.6, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 4.7. Following the notations in Theorem 4.6, if we let m = z0 + 2z1, then C
forms an almost optimal ZCZ sequence set with parameters (2k, 2m, 2m−k − 1).
Example 4.6. Following the construction of Theorem 4.6 and letingt m = 8, z1 = 3,
k = z0 = 2, q = 8, I0 = {3, 4, 5}, I1 = {1}, I2 = {2}, pi0(1) = 4, pi0(2) = 3, pi0(3) = 5,
pi1(1) = 1, pi2(1) = 2, θ(1) = 1, θ(2) = 2, then we can have the Boolean function Q given by
Q = (4x4x6 + 4x3x7 + 4x5x8 + 2x3x6 + 2x5x7 + x5x6)
+(4x1x3 + 4x2x5 + 2x1x5) + ρx6 + γ + ω
48
where ρ ∈ {0, q/2}, γ ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2)) and ω ∈ LC(Ω(I0)). Also γ and ω can be expressed
as
γ = λ0 + λ1x1 + λ2x2 + λ3x1x2
and
ω = λ4 + λ5x3 + λ6x4 + λ7x5 + λ8x3x4 + λ9x4x5 + λ10x3x5 + λ11x3x4x5
where λl ∈ Z8 for 0 ≤ l ≤ 11. With the sequence set S constructed by Lemma 4.4, for
0 ≤ i ≤ 3, we can have
ci = (4x4x6 + 4x3x7 + 4x5x8 + 2x3x6 + 2x5x7 + x5x6)
+(4x1x3 + 4x2x5 + 2x1x5) + ρx6 + (λ0 + λ1x1 + λ2x2 + λ3x1x2)
+(λ4 + λ5x3 + λ6x4 + λ7x5 + λ8x3x4 + λ9x4x5 + λ10x3x5 + λ11x3x4x5)
+i(2x1 + 4x2).
The associated graph of ci is depicted in Figure 4.8. Then C = {c0, c1, c2, c3} is an almost
optimal ZCZ sequence set with parameters (4, 256, 63) and the merit figure ηZ of C is 0.984.
Comparing to the result of Example 4.5, it has larger ZCZ but with smaller set size.
4.3 Constructions by Combining Two ZCZ Sequence
Sets
Theorem 4.1 provides a construction of ZCZ sequence set associated with a Boolean function.
In this section, we introduce a method to combine two Boolean functions which can be used
to construct ZCZ sequence set to construct a new ZCZ sequence set. Thus, this method is
equivalent to combining two ZCZ sequence sets.
Theorem 4.8. For any positive integers m, k, z, q, q0 such that z ≤ k, m ≥ k + z, and
q = q02
z. Let nonempty sets I1, I2, . . . , Ik and I˜1, I˜2, . . . , I˜k be two partitions of I where
50
where ρ ∈ {0, q/2}, γ0 ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, . . . , pik)∩Ω(I\Iαˇ)) and γ1 ∈ LC(Γ(θ˜, p˜i1, p˜i2, . . . , p˜ik)∩
Ω(I \ Iαˇ)). Choose an integer κ ∈ Iαˇ and let
Q = (1− xκ)Q0 + xκQ1.
For a Zq-valued sequence set S with 2k sequences of length k satisfying that there exists a
nonnegative integer l < k such that si,l − sj,l = q/2 for any 0 ≤ i < j < 2k, we let
ci = Q+
k∑
α=1
si,α−1
[
(1− xκ)xpiα(mα) + xκxp˜iα(m˜α)
]
.
Let set C = {c0, c1, . . . , c2k−1} where ci is the corresponding sequence of ci for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k−1.
Then C forms a ZCZ sequence set with parameters (2k, 2m, 2m−k − 2m−k−z + 1).
Proof. In the first part, we have to demonstrate that Re,f (τ) = 0 for e,f ∈ C and 0 < τ ≤
2m−k − 2m−k−z, i.e.,
n−1∑
i=0
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi = 0
where n = 2m, e = (e0, e1, . . . , en−1) and f = (f0, f1, . . . , fn−1). For any integer 0 ≤ i < n,
let j = i ⊕n u; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i
and j, respectively. Let h0 be the largest integer such that ih0 ̸= jh0 .
Case 1: Suppose iκ = jκ. If iκ = jκ = 0, then we consider Q = Q0. If iκ = jκ = 1,
then we consider Q = Q1. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1, we can have one-to-one
corresponding i′ and j′ such that
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Case 2: Suppose h0 ≤ m − k − z, and iκ ̸= jκ. Since piα(1) = p˜iα(1) for α = 1, 2, . . . , k,
52
(i) If βˆ − 1 ̸= 1 or αˇ > z, then
ai′ − ai = q
2
(
ipiαˇ(βˆ−2)i
′
piαˇ(βˆ−1) − ipiαˇ(βˆ−2)ipiαˇ(βˆ−1) + i′piαˇ(βˆ−1)ipiαˇ(βˆ) − ipiαˇ(βˆ−1)ipiαˇ(βˆ)
)
=
q
2
(
ipiαˇ(βˆ−2) + ipiαˇ(βˆ)
)
.
Since θ(piαˇ(βˆ − 2)) > θ(piαˇ(βˆ)), we have ipiαˇ(βˆ−2) = jpiαˇ(βˆ−2). Therefore,
aj − ai − aj′ + ai′ = q
2
(
ipiαˇ(βˆ) − jpiαˇ(βˆ)
)
=
q
2
.
(ii) If βˆ − 1 = 1 and αˇ ≤ z, then
ai′ − ai = q02z−1(i′piαˇ(1)ipiαˇ(2) − ipiαˇ(1)ipiαˇ(2))
+q0
(
i′piαˇ(1) − ipiαˇ(1)
) αˇ∑
w=1
2z+w−αˇ−1im−z+w
= q0(1− 2ipiαˇ(1))(2z−1ipiαˇ(2) +
αˇ∑
w=1
2z+w−αˇ−1im−z+w).
Since il = jl for m− z1 < l ≤ m, we have
aj − ai − aj′ + ai′ = q02z−1(ipiαˆ(2) − jpiαˆ(2)) =
q
2
.
Therefore, let e = cl1 and f = cl2 ; then we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = aj − ai − aj′ + ai′
+
k∑
α=1
sl1,α−1
[
(1− jκ)jpiα(mα) + jκjp˜iα(m˜α)

α=1
sl2,α−1
[
(1− i′κ)i′piα(mα) + i′κi′p˜iα(m˜α)
]
= aj − ai − aj′ + ai′
=
q
2
54
(i) If xκ = 0, let i
′ be the integers that are different from i with only one position pih3(mh3),
i.e., i′pih3 (mh3 ) = 1− ipih3 (mh3 ).
(ii) If xκ = 1, let i
′ be the integers that are different from i with only one position p˜ih3(mh3),
i.e., i′p˜ih3 (mh3 ) = 1− ip˜ih3 (mh3 ).
We can have
fi′ − ei′ =
k∑
α=1
(sl2,α−1 − sl1,α−1)
[
(1− xκ)i′piα(mα) + xκi′p˜iα(mα)
]
.
Then
ei − fi − ei′ + fi′
= (sl2,h3−1 − sl1,h3−1)
[
(1− xκ)(1− 2ipih3 (mh3 )) + xκ(1− 2ip˜ih3 (mh3 ))
]
=
q
2
which completes the proof.
Both of Q0 and Q1 satisfy the Boolean function Q in Theorem 4.1. If we take Q0 = Q1
in Theorem 4.8, then it reduces to Theorem 4.1 with constrained γ. In Figure 4.9, the graph
is associated with the function Q with xκ = 0 in Theorem 4.8 and the case for xκ = 1 is
illustrated in Figure 4.10. This method is equivalent to combining two of some ZCZ sequence
sets satisfying Theorem 4.8 to from a new one. Besides, the new ZCZ sequence set preserves
the parameters (M,L,Z) of the two.
Example 4.7. Let m = 8, k = 3, z = 2, q = 4, I1 = {1, 3, 4}, I2 = {2, 5}, I3 = {6},
pi1(1) = 4, pi1(2) = 3, pi1(3) = 1, pi2(1) = 5, pi2(2) = 2, pi3(1) = 6; I˜1 = {4}, I˜2 = {2, 5},
I˜3 = {1, 3, 6}, p˜i1(1) = 4, p˜i2(1) = 5, p˜i2(2) = 2, p˜i3(1) = 6, p˜i3(2) = 1, p˜i3(3) = 3. We choose
αˇ = 2 and κ = 2. And let θ(l) = θ˜(l) = l for 1 ≤ l ≤ 6. Then according to the construction
by Theorem 4.8, the Boolean functions Q is given by
Q = (1− x2)Q0 + x2Q1

For a Zq-valued sequence set S of 2k sequences and of length k satisfying that there exists a
nonnegative integer l < k with si,l − sj,l = q/2 for 0 ≤ i < j < 2k, we let
ci = Q+
k∑
α=1
si,α−1
[
(1− xκ)xpiα(mα) + xκxp˜iα(m˜α)
]
and C = {c0, c1, . . . , c2k−1} where ci is the corresponding sequence of ci for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1.
Then C is a ZCZ sequence set with parameters (2k, 2m, 2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1 + 1).
Proof. In the first part, we demonstrate that Re,f (τ) = 0 for e,f ∈ C and 0 < τ ≤
2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1, i.e.,
n−1∑
i=0
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi = 0
where n = 2m, e = (e0, e1, . . . , en−1) and f = (f0, f1, . . . , fn−1). For any integer 0 ≤ i < n,
let j = i ⊕n u; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i
and j, respectively. Let h0 be the largest integer such that ih0 ̸= jh0 .
Case 1: Suppose iκ = jκ. If iκ = jκ = 0, then we consider Q = Q0. If iκ = jκ = 1,
then we consider Q = Q1. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.4, we can have one-to-one
corresponding i′ and j′ such that
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Case 2: Suppose h0 ≤ m − k − z0 − z1, and iκ ̸= jκ. Let βˆ with 2 ≤ βˇ ≤ mαˇ be the
smallest integer such that ipiαˇ(βˆ) ̸= jpiαˇ(βˆ). We let i′ and j′ be the integers that are different
from i and j, respectively, with only one position piαˇ(βˆ − 1). Similar to Case 2 in the proof
of Theorem 4.8, we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Case 3: Suppose h0 > m − k − z, and iκ ̸= jκ. Let a = Q0 and b = Q1 and then
Q = (1−xκ)a+xκb. Let a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) and b = (b0, b1, . . . , bn−1) be the corresponding
sequences of a and b, respectively.
62
Then in the second part, for e ̸= f and τ = 0, similar to the second part in the proof of
Theorem 4.8, we have
Re,f (0) =
2m−1∑
i=0
ξei−fi = 0.
which completes the proof.
Both of Q0 and Q1 satisfy the Boolean function Q in Theorem 4.4. If we take Q0 = Q1
in Theorem 4.9, then it reduces to Theorem 4.4 with constrained γ. The associated graph
of the function Q with xκ = 0 in Theorem 4.9 is depicted in Figure 4.13. Besides, when
xκ = 1, the associated graph is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Therefore, we can have a new ZCZ
sequence set from two of some ZCZ sequence sets satisfying Theorem 4.4 and the parameters
(ML,Z) are not changed.
Example 4.8. Let m = 8, k = 3, z1 = 2, z0 = 2, q = 4, I0 = {4, 5}, pi0(1) = 5, pi0(2) = 4,
I1 = {1, 2}, I2 = {3}, I3 = {6}, pi1(1) = 2, pi1(2) = 1, pi2(1) = 3, pi3(1) = 6; I˜1 = {2},
I˜2 = {1, 3}, I˜3 = {6}, p˜i1(1) = 2, p˜i2(1) = 3, p˜i2(2) = 1, p˜i3(1) = 6, and then we take αˇ = 3
and κ = 6. Let θ(l) = θ˜(l) = l for l = 1, 2, 3 and θ(6) = θ˜(6) = 4. Then according to the
construction of Theorem 4.9, the Boolean function Q is given by
Q = (1− x6)Q0 + x6Q1.
In the above Q,
Q0 = 2x1x2 + (2x5x7 + 2x4x8 + x4x7) + (2x2x5 + 2x3x4 + x2x4) + γ0 + ω
and
Q1 = 2x1x3 + (2x5x7 + 2x4x8 + x4x7) + (2x2x5 + 2x3x4 + x2x4) + γ1 + ω
where ρ ∈ {0, 2}, ω ∈ LC(Ω(I0)), γ0 ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, pi3)∩Ω({1, 2, 3})) and γ1 ∈ LC(Γ(θ˜, p˜i1, p˜i2, p˜i3)∩
Ω({1, 2, 3})). We can obtain Ω(I0) = {1, x4, x5, x4x5}, Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, pi3) ∩ Ω({1, 2, 3}) = {1,

Proof. In the first part, we have to demonstrate that Re,f (τ) = 0 for e,f ∈ C and 0 < τ ≤
2m−k − 2m−z0−2z1+1, i.e.,
n−1∑
i=0
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi = 0
where n = 2m, e = (e0, e1, . . . , en−1) and f = (f0, f1, . . . , fn−1). For any integer 0 ≤ i < n,
let j = i ⊕n u; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i
and j, respectively. Let h0 be the largest integer such that ih0 ̸= jh0 .
Case 1: Suppose iκ = jκ. If iκ = jκ = 0, then we consider Q = Q0. If iκ = jκ = 1,
then we consider Q = Q1. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.6, we can have one-to-one
corresponding i′ and j′ such that
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Case 2: Suppose h0 ≤ m− z0− 2z1, and iκ ̸= jκ. Let βˆ with 2 ≤ βˇ ≤ mαˇ be the smallest
integer such that ipiαˇ(βˆ) ̸= jpiαˇ(βˆ). We let i′ and j′ be the integers that are different from i and
j, respectively, with only one position piαˇ(βˆ − 1). Similar to Case 2 in the proof of Theorem
4.8, we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
Case 3: Suppose h0 > m − z0 − 2z1, and iκ ̸= jκ. Let a = Q0 and b = Q1 and then
Q = (1−xκ)a+xκb. Let a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) and b = (b0, b1, . . . , bn−1) be the corresponding
sequences of a and b, respectively.
(i) If there exist il ̸= jl for some l ∈ I0, then we take i′ and j′ as in Case 2 in the proof of
Theorem 4.6.
(ii) If il = jl for l ∈ I0 and there exist il ̸= jl for some m − z1 + 1 ≤ l ≤ m − k, then we
take i′ and j′ as in Case 3 in the proof of Theorem 4.6.
70
Both of Q0 and Q1 satisfy the Boolean function Q in Theorem 4.6. If we take Q0 = Q1
in Theorem 4.10, then it reduces to Theorem 4.6 with constrained γ. In Figure 4.17, the
associated graph of the function Q with xκ = 0 in Theorem 4.10 is depicted. Besides, in
Figure 4.18, the associated graph of the case for xκ = 1 is illustrated. Two of some ZCZ
sequence sets satisfying Theorem 4.6 can be combined to form a new one with the same
parameters (M,L,Z) as the two.
Example 4.9. Let m = 11, z1 = 3, k = z0 = 2, q = 8, I0 = {6, 7, 8}, pi0(1) = 6, pi0(2) = 7,
pi0(2) = 8, I1 = {2, 4}, I2 = {1, 3, 5}, pi1(1) = 4, pi1(2) = 2, pi2(1) = 5, pi2(2) = 3, pi2(3) = 1;
I˜1 = {2, 4}, I˜2 = {1, 3, 5}, p˜i1(1) = 4, p˜i1(2) = 2, p˜i2(1) = 5, p˜i2(2) = 1 and p˜i2(3) = 3. Then
we choose αˇ = 1 and κ = 4. Let θ(l) = θ˜(l) = l, for 1 ≤ l ≤ 5. Then according to the
construction of Theorem 4.10, the Boolean function Q is
Q = (1− x4)Q0 + x4Q1.
In the above Q,
Q0 = (4x2x4 + 4x1x3 + 4x3x5) + (4x6x9 + 4x7x10 + 2x7x9 + 4x8x11 + 2x8x10 + x8x9)
+(4x4x7 + 2x4x8 + 4x5x8) + ρx9 + γ0 + ω
and
Q1 = (4x2x4 + 4x1x3 + 4x1x5) + (4x6x9 + 4x7x10 + 2x7x9 + 4x8x11 + 2x8x10 + x8x9)
+(4x4x7 + 2x4x8 + 4x5x8) + ρx9 + γ1 + ω
where ρ ∈ {0, 4}, ω ∈ LC(Ω(I0)), γ0 ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2) ∩ Ω({1, 3, 5})) γ1 ∈ LC(Γ(θ˜, p˜i1, p˜i2) ∩
Ω({1, 3, 5})). We can obtain Ω(I0) = {1, x6, x7, x8, x6x7, x7x8, x6x8, x6x7x8}, Γ(θ, pi1, pi2)∩
Ω({1, 3, 5}) = {1, x1, x3, x5}, and Γ(θ˜, p˜i1, p˜i2)∩Ω({1, 3, 5}) = {1, x1, x3, x5, }. Then with the
sequence set S generated by Lemma 4.3, we have the ZCZ sequence set C = {c0, c1, . . . , c7}

Lemma 5.1. For any positive integer m, k0, k1 with k0 < k1 < m, let u = 2
k1−2k0 + t where
1 ≤ t < 2k0. For any positive integer i with 0 ≤ i < n, let n = 2m and j = i ⊕n u. If i
mod 2k0 ≥ 2k0 − t, then il = jl for k0 < l ≤ k1.
Proof. Let p = i mod 2k0 and q = i− p, and then we have ql = il for l > k0 and ql = 0 for
l ≤ k0. Let r = u+p = 2k1−2k0 + t+p. Since p ≥ 2k0− t and p, t < 2k0 , we have r = 2k0 + s
where 0 ≤ s < 2k0 , i.e., sl = 0 for l > k0. Then we have
j = i⊕n u
= (i+ u) mod n
= (q + p+ u) mod n
= (q + 2k1 + s) mod n.
Therefore, jl = ql = il for k0 < l ≤ k1.
Lemma 5.2. We follow the notations of Theorem 4.1. Suppose
τ = 2m−k − 2m−k−z + t
where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2m−k−z. Then, for any e,f ∈ C, we have
|Re,f (τ)| ≤ t2k+z.
Proof. Let j = i ⊕n τ , and (i1, i2, . . . , im), (j1, j2, . . . , jm) and (τ1, τ2, . . . , τm) be the binary
representation of i, j, and τ , respectively. Let h0 be the largest integer such that ih0 ̸= jh0 .
Since 2m−k−1 < τ < 2m−k, we have τm−k = 1 and thus h0 ≥ m−k. By case 2 of Theorem 4.1,
if there exists l with m− k− z+1 ≤ l ≤ m− k and il ̸= jl, then we can have corresponding
i′ to form
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0.
78
In the first part, we show that, for e ∈ C1, f ∈ C2,
|Re,f (τ)| ≤ 2m−p, for |τ | ≤ 2m−k − 2m−k−z.
For any integer 0 ≤ i < n, let j = i ⊕n τ ; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the
binary representations of i and j, respectively. Moreover, i is the index for sequence e ∈ C1
and j is the index for sequence f ∈ C2. We divide Q1 and Q2 as Q1 = a+b and Q2 = a+b+v
where a is the same as (4.1), b = γ and
v =
q
2
p∑
t=1
xpift (mft−1) + µ.
Let a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1), b = (b0, b1, . . . , bn−1),v = (v0, v1, . . . , vn−1) and µ = (µ0, µ1, . . . , µn−1)
be the corresponding sequences of a, b, v and µ, respectively. Let h0 be the largest integer
such that ih0 ̸= jh0 .
Case 1: Suppose h0 ≤ m− k − z, and there exists an integer l ∈ I \ F such that il ̸= jl,
and then let h1 with h1 ∈ I \ F and ih1 ̸= jh1 be the integer that maximum θ(h1). Since
h1 ∈ I, there exist αˆ and βˆ with 1 ≤ αˆ ≤ k and 2 ≤ βˆ ≤ mαˆ such that piαˆ(βˆ) = h1. We let
i′ and j′ be the integers that are different from i and j, respectively, with only one position
piαˆ(βˆ − 1). Let e = cl1 and f = cl2 . From the result of Case 1 in the proof of Theorem 4.1,
we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
+ vj − vj′ .
Since v ∈ Γ(θ, pi1, pi2 . . . , pik), similar to Case 1 in the proof of Theorem 4.1, we can have
vj − vj′ = 0. Therefore, we have ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q/2.
Case 2: Suppose il = jl for each l ∈ Nm \ F , and there exists an integer l ∈ F such that
il = jl. Let h2 be an integer in F such that ih2 = jh2 , and then there exists υˆ with 1 ≤ υˆ ≤ p
and mfυˆ ≥ 2 such that h2 = xpifυˆ (mfυˆ ). We let i′ and j′ be the integers that are different from
i and j, respectively, with only one position pifυˆ(mfυˆ − 1).
80
Case 3: Suppose il = jl for each l ∈ Nm \ F and il ̸= jl for every l ∈ F . We let i′
and j′ be the integers that are different from i and j, respectively, with only one position
pif1(mf1−1). Similar to Case 1 in the proof of Theorem 4.1, we have aj−ai−aj′+ai′ = q/2 and
bj−bi−bj′+bi′ = 0. And similar to Case 2, we have vj′−vj = q/2. Then ej−fi−ej′+fi′ = 0
which implies
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 1.
Consider r0 > r1 > . . . > rp−1 are integers in F . This case occurs when
τ = 2r0−1 +
p−1∑
t=1
gt2
rt−1
where gt ∈ {1,−1} and ir0 = 0, irt = (1− gt)/2 for 1 ≤ t ≤ p− 1. There are 2m−p such i’s.
Case 4: Suppose h0 > m − k − z, take i′ and j′ the same as in the Case 2 in the proof
of Theorem 4.1, and then jl = j
′
l for all l ∈ I and thus vj′ − vj = 0. By the result Case 2 in
the proof of Theorem 4.1, we have
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
+ vj − vj′ = q
2
.
From these four cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such
that
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0 or 1.
and ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 1 only in Case 3. Then we can conclude that
Re,f (τ) =
{
2m−p, for τ = 2r0−1 +
∑p−1

0, otherwise.
In the second part, we show that for e ∈ C1,f ∈ C2
Re,f (0) =

i=0
ξei−fi = 0.
82
Corollary 5.2. Following the notations in Theorem 5.1, if we let m = 2k + z and |It| = 2
for 1 ≤ t ≤ k, then C is an LCZ sequence set with parameters (2k+1, 2m, 2m−k−2k+2, 2m−k).
When k ≫ z, we can have
ηL ≈
√
2z − 2
22z+1 − 2z+1 .
Example 5.1. Let m = 8, k = 3, z = 2, q = 4, I1 = {1, 4}, I2 = {2, 5}, I3 = {3, 6},
pi1(1) = 4, pi1(2) = 1, pi2(1) = 5, pi2(2) = 2, pi3(1) = 6, pi3(2) = 3 and then p = 3 and
F = {1, 2, 3}. Also let θ(l) = l for 1 ≤ l ≤ 6. Then according to the construction of
Theorem 5.1, the Boolean functions Q1 and Q2 are given by
Q1 = (2x1x4 + 2x2x5 + 2x3x6) + (2x4x7 + 2x5x8 + x5x7) + ρx7 + γ
and
Q2 = Q1 + (2x4 + 2x5 + 2x6) + µ
where ρ ∈ {0, 2} and γ ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, pi3)∩Ω({4, 5, 6}) and µ ∈ LC(Ω(F )). We can obtain
Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, pi3)∩Ω({4, 5, 6}) = {1, x4, x5, x6, x4x5, x5x6, x4x6, x4x5x6}, and Ω(F ) = {1, x1,
x2, x3, x1x2, x2x3, x1x3, x1x2x3}. Then with the sequence set S generated by Lemma 4.3,
we have the two ZCZ sequence sets C1 = {c10, c11, . . . , c17} and C2 = {c20, c21, . . . , c27} where
c1i = (2x1x4 + 2x2x5 + 2x3x6) + (2x4x7 + 2x5x8 + x5x7) + ρx7

and
c2i = (2x4 + 2x5 + 2x6) + (2x1x4 + 2x2x5 + 2x3x6) + (2x4x7 + 2x5x8 + x5x7) + ρx7

Case 3: Suppose il = jl for each l ∈ Nm \ F and il ̸= jl for every l ∈ F . Taking i′ and j′
the same as in Case 3 in the proof of Theorem 5.1, we can have

(i) Suppose there exists il ̸= jl for some l ∈ I0, and we take i′ and j′ as in Case 2 in the

(ii) Suppose m− k − z0 − z1 < h0 ≤ m− z1 and il = jl for l ∈ I0, and we take i′ and j′ as
in Case 3 in the proof of Theorem 4.4.
(iii) Suppose m− z1 < h0 ≤ m and il = jl for l ∈ I0, and we take i′ and j′ as in Case 4 in
the proof of Theorem 4.4.
From the result of Cases 2, 3 and 4 in the proof of Theorem 4.4, we obtain
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
+ vj − vj′ .
Since jl = j
′
l for l ∈ I for each j′ of these cases, we have vj − vj′ = 0. Then
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
.
From these four cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such
that
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0 or 1
and ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi+ ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 1 only in Case 3. Considering r0 > r1 > . . . > rp−1 are integers
in F , we can conclude that
Re,f (τ) =

where ρ ∈ {0, 2}, γ ∈ LC(Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, pi3) ∩ Ω({4, 5, 8}), ω ∈ LC(Ω(I0)) and µ ∈ LC(Ω(F )).
We can obtain Γ(θ, pi1, pi2, pi3) ∩ Ω({4, 5, 8}) = {1, x4, x5, x8, x4x5, x4x8, x5x8, x4x5x8},
Ω(I0) = {1, x6, x7, x6x7}, Ω(F ) = {1, x1, x2, x3, x1x2, x2x3, x1x3, x1x2x3}. And then
with the sequence set S generated by Lemma 4.3, we have the two ZCZ sequence sets C1 =
{c10, c11, . . . , c17} and C2 = {c20, c21, . . . , c27} where
c1i = (2x3x4 + 2x2x5 + 2x1x8) + (2x6x9 + 2x7x10 + x7x9) + (2x6x4 + 2x7x5 + x7x4) + ρx9

for 0 ≤ i ≤ 7, ρ ∈ {0, 2}, λl ∈ Z4 for 0 ≤ l ≤ 19 and (i1, i2, i3) is the binary representation of
i. The associated graphs of c1i and c
2
i are depicted in Figures 5.3 and 5.4, respectively. Then
C1 and C2 are ZCZ sequence sets with parameters (8, 1024, 113) and the set C = C1 ∪ C2 is
an LCZ sequence set with parameters (16, 1024, 113, 128). Actually, the length of the LCZ of
the LCZ sequence set C is longer than 113. The merit figure ηL of C is larger than 0.027.
Theorem 5.5. Following the notations in Theorem 4.6, we take m ≥ k+2z1+ z0+1. For a
positive integer p ≤ k, let f1, f2, . . . , fp ∈ Nk be distinct integers with mfi ≥ 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ p,
90
and let F = {xpift (mft ) : 1 ≤ t ≤ p}. Consider two Zq-valued Boolean functions

k∑
α=1
si,α−1xpiα(mα)
and cji be the corresponding sequence of c
j
i for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1 and j = 1, 2. Then the
sets C1 = {c10, c11, . . . , c12k−1} and C2 = {c20, c21, . . . , c22k−1} are two ZCZ sequence sets with
parameters (2k, 2m, 2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1 + 1). Let C = C1 ∪ C2, and then C forms an LCZ
sequence set with parameters (2k+1, 2m, 2m−k − 2m−z0−2z1+1 + 1, 2m−p).
Proof. For two sequence e, f in C, if both of e and f lie in C1 or C2, then by Theorem 4.6,
we have
Re,f (τ) = 0, for |τ | ≤ 2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1.
In the first part, we show that, for e ∈ C1, f ∈ C2,
|Re,f (τ)| ≤ 2m−p, for |τ | ≤ 2m−k − 2m−k−z0−z1+1.
92
(iii) Suppose m− k + 1 ≤ h0 ≤ m and il = jl for m− 2z1 + 1 ≤ l ≤ m− k, and we take i′
and j′ as in Case 4 in the proof of Theorem 4.6.
From the result of Cases 2, 3 and 4 in the proof of Theorem 4.6, we obtain
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q
2
+ vj − vj′ .
Since jl = j
′
l for l ∈ I for each j′ of these cases, we have vj − vj′ = 0. Then
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = 0.
From these four cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such
that
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0 or 1.
and ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 1 only in Case 3. Consider r0 > r1 > . . . > rp−1 are integers
in F , and we can conclude that
Re,f (τ) =
{
2m−p, for τ = 2r0−1 +
∑p−1
t=1 gt2
rt−1
0, otherwise.
Therefore, in the second part, for e ∈ C1,f ∈ C2 and τ = 0, similar to the second part
of Theorem 4.6, we can have
Re,f (0) =
2m−1∑
i=0
ξei−fi = 0
which completes the proof.
Similar to Theorem 5.3, the claimed length of LCZ of the constructed LCZ sequence sets
by Theorem 5.5 is the same as that of the ZCZ of their component LCZ sequence sets. The
associated graphs of the function Q1 and Q2 given in Theorem 5.5 are the same as that of
Q in Theorem 4.6.
The following corollary gives the merit figure of the constructed sequence sets obtained
from Theorem 5.5 with specific parameters.

i are depicted in Figures 5.5 and 5.6, respectively.
Then the sets C1 and C2 are ZCZ sequence sets with parameters (4, 2048, 497) and the set
C = C1∪C2 is an LCZ sequence set with parameters (8, 2048, 497, 512). Actually, the length
of the LCZ of C is longer than 497. We have the merit figure ηL of C is larger than 0.0615.

5.2 Extended Constructions of LCZ Sequence Sets
In this section, we introduce some extended constructions of LCZ sequence sets from Boolean
functions by setting some more constraints in Theorems 4.1, 4.4 and 4.6.
Theorem 5.7. For any positive integers m, k, z, q, q0 such that z ≤ k, m ≥ k+z+2, and q =
q02
z. Let nonempty sets I1, I2, . . . , Ik+1 be a partition of I where I = Nm−z and |Ik+1| = 1.
Let mα = |Iα| and piα be a bijection from Nmα to Iα such that m−k− z+1 ≤ piα(1) ≤ m−k
for α = 1, 2, . . . , z and piα(1) = m − α + 1 for α = z + 1, z + 2, . . . , k. Let θ be a bijection
from Nm−z to I such that θ(piα(β)) > θ(piα(β+1)) for 1 ≤ α ≤ k and 1 ≤ β ≤ mα−1. For a
positive integer p ≤ k, let f1, f2, . . . , fp ∈ Nk be distinct integers with mfi ≥ 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ p,
and let fp+1 = k + 1. Let
F = {pift(mft) : 1 ≤ t ≤ p+ 1}
and
F˜ = {pift(mft − 1) : 1 ≤ t ≤ p}.
Define
W = Ω(I \ F ) ∪ Ω(I \ F˜ ).

Consider r0 > r1 > . . . > rp are integers in F . This case occurs when

where gt ∈ {1,−1} and ir0 = 0, irt = (1− gt)/2 for 1 ≤ t ≤ p. There are 2m−p−1 such i’s.

of Theorem 4.1, and then il = i

l and jl = j

l for all l ∈ I and thus ui′ − ui = uj′ − uj = 0.
By the result of Case 2 of Theorem 4.1, we have

.
From these four cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such
that
ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 0 or 1
and ξe(i⊕nτ)−fi + ξe(i′⊕nτ)−fi′ = 1 only in Case 3. We can conclude that

Then in the second part, for e ̸= f and τ = 0, similar to the second part of Theorem
4.1, we can have
Re,f (0) =

i=0
ξei−fi = 0.
In the third part, similar to the third part of Theorem 5.1, we can have
|Re,f (τ)| ≤ 2m−p−1
for τ with 2m−k − 2m−k−z + 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2m−k − 2m−k−z + 2m−k−z−p−1. This completes the
proof.
Compared with Theorem 4.1, in Theorem 5.7, I is partitioned to k + 1 parts and Q has
additional second order monomials, xpift (mft−1)xpift+1 (mft+1 ), and constrained γ. And thus,

(i) Suppose there exists il ̸= jl for some l ∈ I0, and we take i′ and j′ as in Case 2 in the

(ii) Suppose m− k − z0 − z1 < h0 ≤ m− z1 and il = jl for l ∈ I0, and we take i′ and j′ as

(iii) Suppose m− z1 < h0 ≤ m and il = jl for l ∈ I0, and we take i′ and j′ as in Case 4 in

From the results of Cases 2, 3 and 4 in the proof of Theorem 4.4, we obtain

Since il = i

Then

From these four cases, for any 0 ≤ i < n, we can find one-to-one corresponding i′ such

let j = i ⊕n u; also let (i1, i2, . . . , im) and (j1, j2, . . . , jm) be the binary representations of i

Case 1: Suppose h0 ≤ m− k− z0− z1 and there exists an integer l ∈ Nm−z0−2z1 \F such
that il ̸= jl. Then let h1 with h1 ∈ Nm−z0−2z1 \F and ih1 ̸= jh1 be the integer that maximum

representation of i. The associated graph of ci is depicted in Figure 5.12. Then C is an LCZ
sequence set with parameters (8, 2048, 497, 256). Actually, the length of the LCZ of the LCZ
sequence set C is longer than 497, so the merit figure ηL > 0.123.
Discussion
Similar to the discussion in Section 5.1, the constructed LCZs in Theorems 5.7, 5.9 and
5.11 may be slightly longer than what are claimed in those Theorems.
Compared with Theorem 5.7, Theorems 5.9 and 5.11 have longer LCZs but larger corre-

(ii) Suppose il = jl for k + 1 ≤ l ≤ k + z, and let 1 ≤ αˆ ≤ z be the smallest integer such

since il = jl for 1 ≤ l ≤ k.
Case 2: When 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2k − 1, we have τl = 0 for l ≥ k + 1. If imod 2k > τ , then
i + τ has a carrier 1 into the position k + 1. Since τk+1 = 0, we have jk+1 = ik+1 ⊕2 1, i.e.,
ik+1 ̸= jk+1. Then we can take i′ and j′ the same as those in Case 1 to form
ej − fi − ej′ + fi′ = q

.
On the contrary, if imod 2k < 2k − τ , then il = jl for l ≥ k + 1. The corresponding i′ such
that ei⊕nτ − fi − ei′⊕nτ + fi′ = q/2 may not exist. For each τ with 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2k − 1, we have
2k − τ over 2k such i’s, and thus we can derive that

Figure 5.14: Associated graph of the function ci in Example 5.7.
Example 5.7. Let k = 2, z = 1, q = 2 and pi(1) = 3. Then according to Lemma 5.4, the
Boolean function Q is given by
Q = x3x4 + ρx4 + ω + ψ
where ρ ∈ {0, 2}, ω ∈ LC(Ω(3)) and ψ ∈ LC(Ω(1, 2)). We can obtain Ω(3) = {1, x3} and
Ω(1, 2) = {1, x1, x2, x1x2}. With the sequence set S generated by Lemma 4.3, we have the set
C = {c0, c1, c2, c3} where
ci = (x3x4) + ρx4 + (λ0 + λ1x3) + (λ2 + λ3x1 + λ4x2 + λ5x1x2) + i1x1 + i2x2
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 where ρ ∈ {0, 1}, λl ∈ Z2 for 0 ≤ l ≤ 5 and (i1, i2) is the binary representation
of i. The associated graph of ci is depicted in Figure 5.14. For any sequences ci and cj in
C, the periodic cross-correlation function
|Rci,cj(τ)| ≤

0, for |τ | = 0 and i ̸= j
12, for |τ | = 1
8, for |τ | = 2
4, for |τ | = 3
0, otherwise.
We can see that the sequence sets constructed in Lemma 5.4 have zero correlations for
large shift τ . We can apply Lemma 5.3 to the constructed sequence sets obtained from
Lemma 5.4 such that the zero or low correlations lies within a range.
124
Then, since |Tτ | ≥ 2k − σ, we have
|Rcˆi,cˆj(τ)| = |Rci,cj([pτ ]n)| = |Rci,cj(Tτ )|
≤ 2k+2z(1− 2
k − σ
2k
) = σ22z for 0 < |τ | < Zp
where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2k.
In Theorem 5.13, since the upper bound on |Ra,b(τ)| for any a and b in C is symmetric
with respect to the origin, we have Zp = Z−p = Zn−p. Obviously, for p with 0 < p < 2k − σ,
we have Zp = 1. Thus, we can search through odd integers within (2
k − σ, n/2) to find p
which maximizes Zp. With the same constellation size, the sequence length grows as the set
size increases.
Example 5.8. Let C be the sequence set in Example 5.7 with ρ = 0 and λl = 0 for 0 ≤ l ≤ 5.
We have
C = {(0000111100000000), (0101101001010101),
(0011110000110011), (0110100101100110)}.
For σ = 1, i.e., δ = 4, let p = 3, and then we have the sequence set
Cˆ = {(0001100001000010), (1011001011101000),
(1101010010001110), (0111111000100100)}.
For any ci and cj ∈ Cˆ, we have
|Rcˆi,cˆj(τ)| ≤

0, for |τ | = 0 and i ̸= j
4, for |τ | = 1
12, for |τ | = 5
8, for |τ | = 6
0, otherwise.
126
Therefore, we have Zp = 2
2z − 1.
Case 3: If 1 < k < 2z, we have p = 22z + 1. Then
pt2k mod n = t2k for 1 ≤ t ≤ 22z − 1
and
p(t2k − 1) mod n = n+ t2k − 22z − 1 for 1 ≤ t ≤ 22z−k.
We also have
p[(t− 1)2k + i] mod n = (t− 1)2k + pi for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1.
When p(t2k − 1)mod n ≤ n− 2k, i.e., 1 ≤ t ≤ 22z−k − 1, we have
2k ≤ p[(t− 1)2k + i] ≤ n− 2k for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1
that is,
2k ≤ pτ ≤ n− 2k for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 22z − 2k − 1. (5.1)
Let d = 22z − 2k, and then
2k ≤ p(d+ i) mod n = (i+ 1)22z − 2k + i ≤ n− 2k for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 2 (5.2)
From (5.1) and (5.2), we can obtain
2k ≤ pτ ≤ n− 2k for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 22z − 2.
When τ = 22z − 1, pτ ≡ −1 (mod n). Therefore, we have Zp = 22z − 1.
Moreover, taking z = 1 in Corollary 5.14, we obtain that the constructed set Cˆ is a
binary ZCZ sequence set with parameters (2k, 2k+2, 3) which achieves the expected bound
given in (2.3).

Conclusion
In this report, we have shown how to obtain ZCZ and LCZ sequence sets from generalized
Boolean functions. We summarize our results as follows:
• Theorems 4.1, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6 provide direct constructions of ZCZ sequence sets with
different set sizes, sequence lengths, lengths of ZCZ, and constellation sizes. The con-
structed ZCZ sequence sets have large ZCZs and can achieve or approach the theoretical
bound in many cases.
• Theorems 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 provide more different ZCZ sequence sets with the same
parameters (M,L,Z) as those constructed by Theorems 4.1, 4.4 and 4.6, respectively.
• Theorems 5.1, 5.3 and 5.5 provide direct constructions of LCZ sequence sets which
consists of a pair of ZCZ sequence sets.
• Theorems 5.7, 5.9 and 5.11 also provide direct constructions of LCZ sequence sets.
With the same parameters m, k, z, z0, z1 and p, they can provide LCZ sequence sets
with half correlation values compared to those constructed by Theorems 5.1, 5.3 and
5.5, respectively.
• Theorem 5.13 can generate ZCZ and LCZ sequence sets from the special sequence sets

employs the amplify-and-forward (AF) transmission scheme
[1]. To enable channel estimation at the receiver, pilots are
inserted into a subset of subcarriers at both the source and the
relay, which are represented by the index sets PS ⊂ N and
PR ⊂ N , respectively. The data subcarriers used at the source
and the relay are then represented by the index sets DS =
N \ PS and DR = N \ PR. Suppose that |PS| = |PR| = Np
and |DS| = |DR| = Nd = N −Np.
Let sk be the symbol transmitted by the source on subcarrier
k, which can either be a data or a pilot symbol. Assume that
both the data and the pilot symbols have constant amplitude
such that |sk|2=ρd, ∀k∈DS, and that |s|2=ρp, ∀∈PS. The
discrete-time channel impulse responses on the SR and RD
links are of the lengths L1 and L2, respectively, and denoted by
hSR∼ CN (0,RSR) and hRD∼ CN (0,RRD) where RSR =
E{hSRhHSR} = diag{[σ2SR(0), . . . , σ2SR(L1−1)]} and RRD =
diag{[σ2RD(0), . . . , σ2RD(L2 − 1)]} with
∑L1−1
n=0 σ
2
SR(n) = 1
and
∑L2−1
n=0 σ
2
RD(n) = 1. The guard interval in an OFDM
symbol is assumed to be greater than or equal to the channel
length so that inter-symbol interference is eliminated. The
frequency-domain channel responses can be written as the
vectors HSR = [HSR,0, · · · ,HSR,N−1]T =
√
NWL1hSR and
HRD=[HRD,0, · · · ,HRD,N−1]T =
√
NWL2hRD, where WL
is the truncated unit-norm fast Fourier transform (FFT) matrix
of size N × L with [W]k = 1√N exp(−j
2π(k−1)(−1)
N ).
The signal received at the relay can be expressed as
YR = [YR,0, . . . , YR,N−1]T = SHSR + ZR (1)
where S = diag{s0, . . . , sN−1} and ZR is the complex
Gaussian noise with E[ZRZHR ] = σ2zIN . Here, In denotes an
n×n identity matrix. The pilot symbols sent on the subcarriers
in PS are used to estimate the SR channel at the relay. The
estimated channel is then fed back to the source to determine
the pilot locations in the subsequent symbol periods. The relay
regenerates new pilot symbols on its pilot tones in PR and
forwards the amplified signals on the data subcarriers in DR.
Let φ : DS → DR be the subcarrier pairing function defined
so that φ(k) represents the index of the subcarrier at the relay
that is used to forward the data received on the k-th subcarrier,
and φ is a one-to-one mapping since each data symbol should
be forwarded by only one of the relay’s data subcarriers. The
signal to be forwarded on subcarrier φ(k) is amplified by the
gain Λφ(k) =
√
ρd/(ρd|HˆSR,k|2+σ2z). By ordering the pilot
and data symbols in the increasing order of their indices,
the signals received at the destination on the pilot and data
subcarriers, i.e., PR and DR, can be written separately as
Y(p)D = S
(p)
R H
(p)
RD + Z
(p)
D (2)
Y(d)D = Λ
(d)diag{ΦY(d)R }H(d)RD + Z(d)D (3)
respectively, where S(p)R is diagonal matrix containing in its
diagonal the pilot symbols in PR, Y(d)R is the received signals
at the relay on the data subcarriers in DS, Φ is a permutation
matrix chosen based on the subcarrier pairing function φ, Λ(d)
is a diagonal matrix containing in its diagonal the amplification
factors Λφ(k), H
(p)
RD and H
(d)
RD are the RD channel responses
corresponding to the sets PR and DR, and Z(p)D and Z(d)D are
the noise vectors on the pilot and data tones with E[ZDZHD ] =
σ2zIN . The RD channel can be estimated with the regenerated
pilots sent on the subcarriers in PR and fed back to the source.
III. FEEDBACK-AIDED PILOT PLACEMENT WITH
SUBCARRIER PAIRING
Based on the received pilot symbols in (1) and (2), we
use the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator [9] to
obtain the channel estimates. Let us extract the signals received
on the pilot tones in (1) into the vector Y(p)R and multiply it
by the pilot symbols in PS, S(p), to obtain
(S(p))HY(p)R =
√
NρpW
(p)
L1
hSR + (S(p))HZ
(p)
R (4)
where W(p)L1 is an Np × L1 matrix comprising the rows of
WL1 that corresponds to the pilot subcarriers belonging to
PS. By (4), the MMSE estimate of hSR can be obtained as
hˆSR =
√
NRSR(W

L1
)HQ−1SR(S
(p))HY(p)R
where QSR = NρpW(p)L1 RSR(W
(p)
L1
)H + σ2zI. Similarly, by
(2), the MMSE estimate of hRD can also be computed as
hˆRD =
√
NRRD(W

(p)

HY(p)D
where QRD = NρpW(p)L2 RRD(W
(p)
L2
)H +σ2zI and W
(p)
L2
is an
Np×L2 matrix comprising the rows of WL2 that correspond
to the pilot subcarriers belonging to PR. The estimates of the
channel frequency responses can then be obtained as
HˆSR =
√
NWL1 hˆSR and HˆRD =
√
NWL2 hˆRD (5)
and the error covariance matrices are given by
ESR = NWL1
(
R−1SR+Nγp ·(W(p)L1 )HW

ERD = NWL2
(
R−1RD+Nγp ·(W(p)L2 )HW
(p)
L2
)−1(WL2)H(7)
where γp = ρp/σ2z is the ratio between the transmit power of
the pilot and the noise variance. The k-th diagonal element of
the matrices ESR and ERD are the estimation errors of HˆSR,k
and HˆRD,k, respectively, and are denoted by SR,k and RD,k.
Let S(d)Φ denote the diagonal matrix containing in its di-
agonal the transmitted data symbols sk, ∀k ∈ DS, arranged
according to the increasing order of their relay subcarrier in-
dices {φ(k)}. Given the channel estimates in (5), the received
signals in (3) on the data tones can be rewritten as

where N˜d = Nd/B, and {QSR,k,∀k} is a sequence of
i.i.d. random variables with distribution equal to the marginal
distribution of |HˆSR,k|2 and QSR,r:n is the r-th ordered
statistic among QSR,0, . . . , QSR,n−1, and the above is the same
for {QRD,k,∀k}. The distributions of QSR,k and QRD,k are
given by FQSR = FQRD = e−qu(q), where u(q) is the unit-
step function. The coherence block B is given by
B =
Coherence Bandwidth
Subcarrier Spacing
=
1/(5TRMS)
1/(NTs)
=
N
cL
where TRMS is the root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, Ts
is the sampling period, and c = 5 · TRMS/(TsL) is chosen
such that the correlation is smaller than 0.5 for subcarriers in
neighboring blocks.
To gain intuitions on the feedback gain, we consider an in-
teresting deterministic scenario, where the channel realizations
are assumed to be at deterministic points that are separated by
intervals of equal probability. That is, the ordered sequence
of channel gains is set as QSR,1:N˜d = v1, . . . , QSR,N˜d:N˜d =
vN˜d , where vi is chosen such that FQSR(vi) =
2i−1
2N˜d
, for
i = 1, . . . , N˜d. Therefore, we have vi = − ln
(
1 − 2i−1
2N˜d
)
,
for i = 1, . . . , N˜d. Similarly, we can also set the values
of QRD,1:N˜d , . . . , QRD,N˜d:N˜d as v1, . . . , vN˜d . In this specific
scenario, the value of ξEQ(min) can be approximated as
ξEQ(min)  min
i∈{1,...,N˜d}

)
= γ1+θL/Np · f
(− ln(1− 1
2N˜d
)
,− ln( 1
2N˜d
)) (14)
which follows by the fact that f(vi, vN˜d+1−i) is concave and
symmetric with respect to i. Details of the proof is omitted
due to space limitations. Similarly, by applying the coherence
block approximation, the lower bound on ξFB(min) under the
deterministic scenario is given by
ξFB(min) ≥ γ1+θL/(βNp) ·f
(− ln(1− 2N˜p+1
2N˜
)
,− ln( 1
2N˜
)) (15)
where N˜p =  (1−β)Np+1B  − 1 and N˜ = N−βNpB . By (14)
and (15), the feedback gain with subcarrier pairing under the
considered deterministic channel can be lower-bounded by
GFB ≥

where (16) follows by taking the first-order Taylor expansion

example, the feedback gain increases with the number of

V. ITERATIVE PILOT RELOCATION POLICY
Due to the high complexity of finding the optimal pilot
locations, we propose a suboptimal policy where iterative
exchanges between pilot tones and the worst data subcarrier
are executed until the preset number of iterations is reached or
no further improvements can be obtained. The source and the
relay have respective pilot locations, and thus, the exchange
procedure is performed for them by turns. In addition, every
time we change the pilot locations at the source or the relay,
the subcarrier pairing of data subcarriers is set to be inverse
mapping from DS to DR according to Proposition 1. The
pseudo-code of the iterative pilot relocation (IPR) algorithm
considering subcarrier pairing at the relay is shown in Fig.
1. In each iteration, we first consider the source node and
perform the exchange between each pilot tone in PS with
the data tone in DS that has the minimum effective SNR
ξk, and then perform the exchange if it improves upon the
minimum effective SNR (c.f. lines 7–20 in Fig. 1). Then, the
same exchange procedure repeats at the relay node to update
PR (c.f. lines 21–22 in Fig. 1). The proposed IPR algorithm
requires complexity of 2N2p , which is much lower than that of
the optimal scheme, which requires complexity of

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
Consider time-varying SR and RD channels with the nor-
malized Doppler frequency set as Fd = fdNTs = 0.001 and
the sampling period Ts set as 50 ns. The channel profiles
are given by the exponential decay profile, where σ2SR(n) =
