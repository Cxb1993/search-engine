rotating beams has attracted relatively little attention despite their profound 
significance in many engineering applications. Wang and Mahrenholtz [5] applied 
Galerkin’s method to examine the bending frequencies of a rotating curved beam and 
used Legendre polynomials to represent the various shape functions of the beam’s 
dynamic response. However, the respective influences of the root stiffness and the 
setting angle were not considered. Park and Kim [6] used the finite element method to 
conduct a dynamic analysis of a rotating curved beam with a tip mass. In their 
analysis, the tendencies of the natural frequency of the beam were evaluated as a 
function of the beam curvature and the tip-mass effect. However, for simplicity, the 
effects of both the hub radius and the root stiffness were ignored.  
In practical engineering applications involving rotating components, the root 
stiffness has a significant effect on the dynamic response of the system. For example, 
a weak root stiffness prompts an instability phenomenon when the beam rotates at a 
speed greater than a certain critical threshold value [7]. Therefore, in analyzing the 
dynamic response and stability characteristics of a rotating beam system, it is essential 
that the root stiffness effect is taken into account. Accordingly, this study utilizes 
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the Hamilton’s principle to derive two governing 
differential equations for the coupled bending-extensional vibration of a rotating 
curved beam with an elastically-restrained root. In the present study, the governing 
equation is solved using the semi-analytical transition matrix method proposed by Lin 
[7]. Utilizing the proposed solution procedure, the respective effects of the setting 
angle, the arc angle, the hub radius, the rotational speed, and the translational 
constants of the root on the natural frequency of the beam are systematically explored. 
Finally, the conditions under which the beam system enters a divergent instability 
condition are identified such that appropriate design and operational guidelines which 
avoid this response can be established.  
 
2. Derivation of governing equations 
 Consider a rotating curved beam elastically restrained in a hub with a setting 
angleψ, as shown in Figure 1, in which θ0, R and Ω are the arc angle, radius, and 
rotational speed of the curved beam, respectively, and rh is the hub radius. In the 
present study, an assumption is made that the beam has a slender cross-section, i.e. its 
thickness in the X’Y’ plane is far thinner than its width or radius of curvature, and thus 
the beam deforms in the X’Y’ plane only. Furthermore, the cross-section of the beam 
is assumed to retain a planar form as the beam bends or undergoes axial deformation. 
Neglecting the effect of shear deformation, and applying the Hamilton’s principle, the 
following governing equations for the free vibration of this beam system can be 
obtained: 
 
 
3. Dimensionless governing equations 
Assuming that the rotating curved beam performs a time-harmonic vibration with 
an angular frequency ω, the dynamic displacements ud and vd can be expressed as  
 ( , ) ( ) i tdv s t V s e
ω=   and ( , ) ( ) i tdu s t U s e ω=  . (7)

Neglecting the Coriolis force effect, the governing characteristic differential equations 
given in Eqs. (1-2) can therefore be expressed in the following dimensionless form:

4.2 Frequency equation 
The current study develops a simple yet efficient algorithm for determining an 
appropriate approximate transition matrix. In the proposed approach, the coefficient 
matrix A(ξ) in Eq. (32) is approximated by n piecewise constant coefficient matrices, 
i.e. A(si), i = 1,2,…,n, where si is any arbitrary value between [ξi-1,ξi] and ξi denotes 
the coordinate position at the end of the ith subsection. Consequently, the transition 
matrix of the ith subsection from ξi-1 to ξi can be obtained as

5. Results and discussions  
In order to verify the accuracy of the proposed semi-analytical solution procedure, 
two illustrative examples are presented concerning the limiting case of a straight beam 
(i.e. R → ∞ and 0 0θ → ). Table 1 summarizes the first two natural frequencies 
obtained by the current method for rotational speeds of α =2 and 10 and hub radii 
of 0µ = , 1 and 5. Note that the setting angle is 090ψ = in every case. It is evident that 
the results are in excellent agreement with those presented in the articles [4, 5].  
Figure 2 compares the results obtained using the proposed method for the 
fundamental natural frequencies of two curved cantilever beams with arc angles of 
0
0 50θ = and 090 , respectively, with those computed using the finite element method 
presented in [6] under equivalent conditions. Again, it is evident that a good 
agreement exists between the two sets of results in both cases. 
Figure 3 illustrates the effects of the setting angle on the fundamental natural 
frequencies of curved rotating cantilevered beams with arc angles of 0θ =0, 030 , 060  
and 090 , respectively and rotational speed of α =10. Note that in each figure, 
sub-figures (a) and (b) correspond to hub radii of 0µ =  and 1, respectively. In Figure 
3(a), it can be seen that the natural frequency of the beam system decreases with an 
increasing arc angle or setting angle. When the beam has both a large arc angle and a 
high setting angle, the fundamental natural frequency reduces rapidly and approaches 
a value of zero, i.e. the beam system exhibits a divergent instability response. Clearly, 
it is essential to prevent the natural frequency of a practical rotating curved beam 
system from falling into this particular operating region. Moreover, comparing 
Figures 3(a) and 3(b), it is evident that the natural frequency also increases with an 
increasing hub radius.
