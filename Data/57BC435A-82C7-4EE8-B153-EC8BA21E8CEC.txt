Wear test 
Two test pieces in pin shape were prepared for each heat 
treatment condition of the high-Cr white cast iron for 
wear tests. The wear tests were carried out by the 
laboratory pin-on-disc method in dried condition using 
alumina (Al2O3) as the counter disc abrasive material. 
The wear test conditions are given in Table 3. The disc 
revolution was interrupted periodically and the test 
pieces removed to measure weight losses. Also, the wear 
rate (Rw) was calculated by dividing the total wear loss 
by test time.

Results and discussion 
The gating and riser system design 
The two-step continuous-pour casting method was 
employed to produce the bi-metal hammers. After 
several trials and continuing modifications, a suitable 
gating and riser system was attained, which is shown in 
Fig. 2(a)15. This particular system consists of a sprue, an 
enlarged and modified overflow, and an open top riser. 
Upon casting, the alloyed steel melt was first poured 
into the mold through the sprue until the melt started to 
come out from the overflow, which can be detected 
readily from a triangular viewing gate. And then, the 
pouring of the high-Cr cast iron melt was immediately 
followed through the same sprue until the mold was 
completely filled. By so doing, a hammer with a rather 
distinct interface between the alloyed steel shank and 
the high-Cr cast iron head can be obtained. The actual 
casting produced is shown in Fig. 2(b).

hammer castings 15; b The actual bi-metal hammer casting produced 
reduced to almost nil as the tempering temperature 
exceeds around 500oC, as indicated in Fig. 8.  
  As for the interface, the majority of the original 
austenitic structure transformed to temper martensite 
after heat treatment, as indicated in Fig. 9. As a result, 
the original austenite band disappeared, forming a rather 
continuous transition from alloyed steel temper 
martensite to high-Cr cast iron temper martensite.
