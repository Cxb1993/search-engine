Abstract: Most researchers have established their inventory lot-size models under trade credit financing
by assuming that the demand rate is constant. However, from a product life cycle perspective, it is clear
that only in the maturity stage the demand is near constant. During the growth stage of a product life cycle
especially for high-tech products, the demand function increases with time. In this research, we extend the
constant demand to a linear non-decreasing demand function of time in a supply chain in which the
supplier offers a permissible delay linked to order quantity, and the retailer also provides a downstream
trade credit period to its customers. Consequently, our proposed model is suitable not only for the growth
but also for the maturity stages of a product life cycle. Then we characterize the optimal solutions,
establish some fundamental theoretical results, and obtain some important and relevant managerial
insights.

1. INTRODUCTION
Under the traditional inventory economic order quantity (EOQ) model, it is assumed that retailers
must pay for items as soon as receiving them. In practice, a supplier frequently offers a retailer a delay
period for payment of the amount owed to him. Usually, there is no interest charge if the outstanding
amount is paid within this permissible delay period. However, if the payment is not paid in full by the end
of the permissible delay period, then interest is charged on the outstanding amount. The permissible delay
in payment produces two benefits to the supplier: (1) it attracts new buyers who consider it as a type of
price reduction, and (2) it may be applied as an alternative to price discount because it does not provoke
competitors to reduce their prices and thus introduce permanent price reductions. On the other hand, the
policy of granting credit terms adds not only an additional cost but also an additional dimension of default
risk to the supplier.
Goyal [1] developed an EOQ model under conditions of permissible delay in payments, and ignored
the difference between the selling price and the purchase cost. Although Dave [2]corrected Goyal’s model 
by addressing the fact that the selling price is necessarily higher than its purchase cost, Dave’s viewpoint
failed to draw sufficient attention from recent researchers. Shah [3] considered a stochastic inventory
model when delays in payments are permissible. Aggarwal and Jaggi [4]extended Goyal’s model to
consider the deteriorating items. Jamal et al. [5] further generalized Aggarwal and Jaggi’s model to allow
for shortages. Hwang and Shinn [6] added the pricing strategy to the model, and developed the optimal
price and lot sizing for a retailer under the condition of permissible delay in payments. Teng [7] amended
Goyal’s model by considering the diference between unit price and unit cost, and found that it makes
economic sense for a well-established buyer to order less quantity and take the benefits of the permissible
4on D(0) = a. Similarly, by using the same formula we can obtain the next optimal cycle time T2 (as well
as Q2) based on the new D(0) = a + b T1. Consequently, the optimal cycle time T (as well as Q) changes
with time except for b = 0. Hence, neither T nor Q are constant during the growth stage of a product life
cycle.
3. When 0NM , the buyer deposits sales revenue into an interest bearing account from time N to M.
At the end of the permissible delay, the buyer pays off all units sold by time NM  , uses uncollected
and unsold items as collateral to apply for a loan, and pays the bank a certain amount of money
periodically until the loan is paid off at time NT .
4. Replenishment rate is instantaneous.
5. The lead time is negligible.
6. Shortages are not allowed to occur.
Now, we are ready to build up the mathematical model.
3. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
Based on the above assumptions, the inventory system here is as follows. At the beginning (i.e., at
time t = 0), the retailer orders and receives Q units of a single product from the supplier. The inventory
level is depleted gradually in the interval [0, T] due to increasing demand from customers. At time t = T,
the inventory level reaches zero. Hence, the inventory level at time t, I(t), can be described by the
following differential equation:

Next, based on order quantity larger than the predetermined quantity or not, we have the following
two cases: (1) dTT  (2) TTd  .
3.1. dTT 
In this case, the retailer’s order quantity is less than dQ . Hence, the permissible delay in payment is
not allowed (i.e., M = 0). Meanwhile, the retailer offers a permissible delay of N to its buyers.
Consequently, the retailer must fiancé all items ordered at time 0, and start to payoff the loan after time N.

In this case, based on the supplier’s trade credit M, and the last customer’s payment time T+N, the

Since NM  , there is no interest earned for the retailer. In addition, the retailer has to finance all
items ordered after time M at an interest charged pI per dollar per year, and start to payoff the loan after
time N as shown in Figure 4. Consequently, the interest charged is given by

5. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
In this section, we provide numerical examples to illustrate several distinct theoretical results as well
as to gain an understanding as to whether the proposed EOQ model with trade credit financing is sensitive
to changes in input data.
Let the demand rate ttf 150200)(  per year, A = $10 per order, h = $0.5/unit/year, c = $0.50/unit,
p = $1.00/unit, pI = 0.06/year, eI = 0.05/year.
Example 1. Let M = 1/6 years, and N = 1/12 years.
(a) If dQ = 100 units, then dT = 0.4305 years. Since M > N, from (23) and (24), we have
01887.00035.1 23  TT .
By (26)–(28), we derive R = -0.1119, S = 0.0569, U = 0.4638, V = 0.2413, D = 0.0018 > 0, and 1T =
0.3706 < dT . Hence, 1* TT  = 0.3706. Substituting 1T = 0.3706 into )(1 TZ in (5), we have )( 11 TZ =
50.8342 and *Q = 84.41.
(b) If dQ = 50 units, then dT = 0.2301 years. By the above algorithm, we have 3706.01T , 3656.02 T ,
3712.03T . Since dTT 3 and 0833.03  NMT , we have 3* TT  = 0.3712. Substituting 3T =
0.3712 into )(3 TZ in (10), we have )( 33 TZ = 49.6569 and
*Q = 84.57.
Example 2. Let M = 1/2 years, and N = 1/12 years and dQ = 50 units. By the above algorithm, we have
3706.01T , 3684.02 T , 3667.03T . Since 2301.02  dTT and 4167.02  NMT , we have 2* TT  =
0.3684. Substituting 2T = 0.3684 into )(2 TZ in (7), we have )( 22 TZ = 46.3964 and
*Q = 83.85.
Example 3. Let M = 1/12 years, and N = 1/6 years, where M < N. If dQ = 50 units, then dT = 0.2301 years.
By the above algorithm, we have 3706.04 T dT . Thus, 4* TT  = 0.3706. Substituting 4T = 0.3706 into
)(4 TZ in (12), we have )( 44 TZ = 50.8342 and
*Q = 84.41.
The mentioned parameter values for M, N, dQ and numerical results can be summarized as in Table 1 and
2.
