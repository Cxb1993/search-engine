chains. Those NLO polyimides showed 
attractive NLO activities and good thermal 
stability.6, 8, 9 Poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(PMMA) containing 2 mol % of 
6-(perfluoroalkyl)benzithiazolylazo dyes have 
larger second-order nonlinear optical coefficient 
(d33) than the same loading amount of Dieperse 
Red 1 (DR 1) dye in PMMA.12 In 1992, 
Osaheni and Jenekhe also showed 
poly(p-phenylenebenzobisthiazole) (PBZT) has 
the potential for nonlinear optical applications 
from their study.13 In 2002, S. H. Lee and his 
co-workers14 synthesized 2,6-diphenylbenzo- 
[1,2-d:4,5-d’]bisthiazole derived chromophores 
and the calculated result of hyperpolarizability 
(β) showed a attractive attention for nonlinear 
optical applications. 
  In this report, we demonstrate the synthesis 
of side chain NLO polyimide is through 
hydroxyl-containing chromophores reacted with 
preimidized hydroxyl-containing polyimide via 
post-Mistunobu reaction. Such polyimide has 
excellent chemical and thermal stabilities due to 
the all aromatic structure, and the polyimide 
will be coated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass 
plate and poled by in-situ poling method for the 
measurement of electrooptic coefficient (r33) in 
the future.

Results and Discussion 
Synthesis and Characterization of 
Polyimides 
In our approach for synthesizing NLO 
 4
increased due to the bulky side groups. Such 
increase in inherent viscosity also indicates the 
successful attachment of chromophores onto the 
polyimide backbone.  
Figure 1, the absorption peaks of asymmetric 
NO2 at 1525 cm-1 were compared with 
symmetric C=O absorption peaks of imide at 
1731 cm-1, the corresponded absorption ratio of 
NO2 – to – C=O was a only slight reduction. 
That indicated the most of precursors of 
benzobisthiazoles in PI-1-A were successfully 
converted to benzobisthiazoles as found in VIII. 
Those polyimides were easily made into films 
and exhibit fairly flexibility. 
 
Thermal Properties 
Polyimides are well known as excellent heat 
resistant polymers but with poor processability. 
In our research, 6FDA was utilized in the 
backbone due to its CF3 groups which improve 
the solubility in aprotic solvents, an example as 
NMP. The thermal performance of such 
polyimdes was therefore reduced than the 
general all aromatic polyimides. The thermal 
properties of the polyimides were evaluated by 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and 
thermomechanical analysis (TMA) as shown in 
Figure 3 and 4. The thermal behavior data of

polyimides are listed in Table 2. II has the 
decomposed temperature (Td) of 406 oC and 
576 oC . Such results indicate that hydroxy 
groups decomposed firstly during the heating, 
Td increases while OH groups decrease in those 
polyimides. Due to amide linkages, cyanoethyl 
chains and nitro group in the side chains of VII 
and VII-b, the decomposition were initiated at 
lower temperatures from the breakage of 
cyanoethyl chains, amide or nitro groups. The 
followed formation of benzobisthiazoles in VIII 
and VIII-b reinforced the thermal stability 
again. However the nitro groups in 
benzobisthiazole derived chromophores and 
ether linkage are the weakest parts for thermal 
resistance and they decomposed firstly during 
the heating, so the thermal stability performed 
worse than II for the higher char yield at 800 
oC. 
  II has glass transition temperature (Tg) of 
335oC by TMA. VIII have a Tg of 312 oC by 
TMA. VIII-b has a Tg of 327 oC by TMA. The

at 290 oC. Next, the poling voltage was 
increased from 100 V to 340 V at 290 oC and 
held at each poling voltage for 10 minutes, 
finally the VIII film was brokedown at 320 V. 
This procress was plotted in Figure 9. The 
maximum r33 value was calculated as 6.62 
pm/V at 320 V. For VIII-b, the poling 
temperature was kept at 290 oC. The poling 
voltage was increased from 0 to 90 V. The 
VIII-b film was broken down at 60 oC (Figure 
10). The maximum r33 value was 7.70 pm/V at 
60 V. 
Conclusion 
The polyimides containing side-chained 
benzobisthiazole-based chromophore were 
successfully synthesized by FTIR. The results 
reveal that the NLO-polyimides possess a long 
term thermal stability at elevated temperatures. 
The measured electroptic coefficient r33 value 
(6.62 pm/V) of VIII was not as high as 
expected, but is acceptable when compared to 
the literature data; this may due mainly to the 
poor efficiency of chromophore orientation.

Self-appraisal 
We report here the results of the 1st-year in 
a 3-year project which is aimed to conduct a 
fundamental investigation on the synthesis and 
characterization of novel non-linear optical 
polyimides (NLO-PI) containing conjugated 
rigid-rod 5-6-5 heterocyclic benzobisthiazoles. 
Based on our previous experience on 
poly(benzobisimidazole) (PBI), this 1st-year 
project starts from the synthesis of 
poly(benzobisthiazoles) (PBT), modifications 
of PBT to become NLO chromophore, and 
attachment of this chromophore to PI backbone 
to obtain the NLO-PI. First, various diacids are 
adopted to synthesize several PIs to improve the 
processability; their chemistry-property- 
microstructure is established. Then the NLO 
chromophore 2,6-diphenylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d’]- 
bisthiazole is prepared using 2,5-diamino- 
1,4-benzenedithiol dihydrochloride (DABDT), 
the monomer used for PBT. Finally, The NLO 
chromophore thus obtained is then attached to 
PI main chain to become the novel NLO-PI, 
which is never being reported. This type of 
heterocyclic benzazo PIs is expected to exhibit 
high electrooptic coefficient r33, high thermal 
stability, and better processability. Among the 
major achievement derived from this project 
include:
