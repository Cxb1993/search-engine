utilizing cationic and amphoteric polymers in alum sludge, and to assess how properties of polymers affect the 
conditioning and dewatering behaviors. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
The alum sludge sample was taken from the sedimentation tank of Chang-Hsing Water Treatment 
Plant in Taipei. The samples were stored in a refrigerator with temperature of 4oC to keep the samples 
unchanged and all experiments were completed within 2 weeks in order to minimize changes in sludge 
characteristics due to microbial activity. Before the conditioning procedure, the sludge from the refrigerator 
must be placed to reach room temperature. The total solid (TS) and suspension solid (SS) of the sludge were 
determined to be 60.75 g/l and 59.36 g/l, respectively using Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). Volatile solid 
was 5.29 g/l. The value of pH ranged from 6.44. Zeta potential was measured by using a laser electrophoresis 
instrument (Mastersizer 3000, Malvern). For zeta potential measurement, flocs were diluted with supernatant 
and ultrasonicated for 30 s to break them into small particles. After settling for about 10 min, the supernatant 
was sampled for measurement. Zeta potential was – 2.5 mV. Amphoteric polymers, AC 4060, AC 2556, 
AC3505, and AC 3054, were provided by Hsi-Tau Co. Ltd. Basic properties of polymers are shown in Table 1.  
A conventional jar-stirring device was used to mix the sludge. Sludge samples of 500 mL in 1,000-mL 
beakers were used in the experiments. In single conditioning, the pre-calculated dose of conditioner was added 
and mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min, followed by 45 rpm for 90 s. In dual conditioning processes, the cationic 
polymer KP-201C is used as preconditioning polymer and then followed with addition of amphoteric 
polymers. Since the optimum dose (cationic polymer KP-201) of polymer in the single conditioning process is 
3.71 kg/ ton SS, the preconditioning polymer dose used in this study is chosen as 1.35 kg/ ton SS. In dual 
conditioning, sludge samples were pre-conditioned with KP-201C and mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min. 
Amphoteric polymer was then added and mixed at 200 rpm for 1 min, followed by 45 rpm for 3 min. 
Experimental procedures of capillary suction time (CST) tests and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) tests 
can be found in our previous work (Lee and Liu, 2000). Alum sludge that was used in this research having CST 
value of 120 second with SRF value 8.26 x 1012 m/kg. The high values of CST and SRF show unfavorable 
sludge dewaterability. Zeta potential shows the net surface charge of sludge is close to zero.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
The results of CST measurement of the dual conditioning process by using amphoteric polymers are presented 
in Fig. 1. It is shown that CST value for a single conditioning process by using cationic polymer KP-201C is 
less than 15 seconds at the dose of polymer of 3.37 kg/ ton SS and reaches the lowest value of 10.8 seconds at 
the dose of 3.71 kg/ ton SS. When the polymer dose increases to 4.04 kg/ ton SS, the CST becomes 13.55 
seconds, implying a slight overdose. In dual conditioning process by using the amphoteric polymer AC 4060, 
the total dose that yields the optimum value of CST is higher than 2.02 and lower than 3.28 kg/ ton SS. In the 
use of amphoteric polymer AC 3505 and AC 3054, the total dose that yields the CST value less than 15 seconds 
is from 2.36 to 3.87 kg/ ton SS; however, the combined use of amphoteric polymer AC 2556 cannot achieve 
CST value less than 15 seconds. The lowest CST value for a dual conditioning system by using the amphoteric 
polymer AC 3054 is 10.3 seconds at a total dose of polymer of 3.28 kg/ ton SS. Nevertheless, the CST values 
obtained by using the amphoteric polymer AC 4060 and AC 3505 are 10.6 and 10.8 seconds at the dose of

conditioning results in lower total polymer dose to reach the optimum CST and SRF, and a wider dosing range 
so that chance for overdose may be lower. 
Figure 3 presents the results of floc size measurement from dual conditioning systems. It is known 
that the floc size of sludge sample before conditioning is 16 µm, while floc size after single conditioning 
becomes 82 - 369 µm for the dose of KP-201C of 1.35 to 5.05 kg/ ton SS, respectively. The floc size from dual 
conditioning system by using amphoteric polymer AC 4060 ranges from

In Fig. 4.14, it is shown charge reversal was found in dual conditioning processes by using amphoteric 
polymers of AC 4060 and AC 3505. While in the conditioning processes by using the AC 2556 and AC 3054 
polymers, the values of the zeta potential also increase to become neutral when the dose of polymer is small (up 
to 1.93 and 2.02 kg/ ton SS). Then the values of the zeta potential decrease again when the dose of polymer 
increases. 
 In the current study, the dual conditioning processes are conducted by using the cationic KP-201C as 
the preconditioning polymer. When the cationic polymers are added and adsorbed, the sludge particles form 
primary flocs. The later added amphoteric polymers are adsorbed at chains and tails of cationic polymers 
driven by hydrogen bond and van der Waals force (Fan et al., 2000). It is well known that the amphoteric 
polymers have a group of charged functional groups (negative and positive) along their chains, so that the 
adsorption reaction is owing to an electrostatic force due to the polarization of chains (Fan et al., 2000; 
Broukhno et al., 2002). It is proposed that amphoteric polymers are adsorbed through both (1) anionic parts to 
the positive shields yielded from a preconditioning process by KP-201C polymers, and (2) cationic parts to the 
rest of the negatively charged surface of solid particles which have not yet been coated by cationic polymers. 
Both amphoteric polymers of AC 4060 and AC 3505 have high cationic to anionic ratios of (6 to 1 and 3 to 1). 
As a result, charge reversal was found. However, both AC 2556 and AC 3054 have low cationic to anionic 
ratios (1/2 and 1/3); therefore, the values of the zeta potential increase slightly to become neutral as a result of 
the cationic polymer  precondition. 
 Supernatant turbidity is an important parameter to be measured, because supernatant turbidity is 
caused by very stable and well-dispersed sludge particles in liquid phase. It is well known that very fine sludge 
particles will cause porosity degradation of the yielded sludge cake during a dewatering process (Novak et al., 
1988; Bache and Zhao, 2001; Lee and Liu, 2000). Furthermore, the flocculation of sludge particles by using 
polymers can prevent filters from plugging by particles (Lee and Liu, 2000).  
 Supernatant turbidities are measured by taking a sample after a conditioning process and leave it for 
quiescent settling for about 30 minutes. Results are presented in Fig. 5. The lowest value of the supernatant 
turbidity in dual conditioning process is  obtained  when  the  cationic  polymer KP-201C is combined with the 
amphoteric polymer AC 3505 that yields the supernatant turbidity of 12.1 to 3.8 NTU, depending on the 
polymer dose. The residual supernatant turbidity in dual conditioning system with AC 2556 is from 42.2 to 
21.1 NTU. In dual conditioning by AC 4060 and AC 3054, the residual supernatant turbidity is in the range of 
14 to 6.4 NTU and of 19.1 to 12.4 NTU, respectively. 
 In dual conditioning systems, the results of measurement in general show lower values of supernatant 
turbidity than tat of single conditioning, except for the combination of the AC 2556. When the cationic
