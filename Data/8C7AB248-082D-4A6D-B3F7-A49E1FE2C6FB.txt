近年來，在接收端透過頻域等化的使用循環
字首 (CP) 單載波 (SC) 調變系統已能夠提供高
速的資訊傳輸 [1]-[3]。一般而言，單載波系統因
為難以解析信號的路徑而不為近代無線通訊系統
所採用。然而近期透過制式化的離散傅利葉轉換
(DFT) 的架構，可將接收端的單載波信號轉換至
頻域加以等化，之後再透過反離散傅利葉轉換
(IDFT) 轉換回時域，便可以以容易實現的架構減

(OFDM)，CP-SC 調變系統因其相當低的鋒均功率
比 (PAPR) 且具備與 OFDM 系統相當的系統錯
誤效能，CP-SC 調變系統在近年來吸引了相當大
的關注，並且具備相當大的潛力應用於未來世代
的無線通訊系統。

Abstract(keyword：Orthogonal multiplexed
modulation, adaptive modulation, power efficiency,
spectral efficiency, cyclic prefix)
Cyclic-prefix (CP) single-carrier (SC)
modulation with frequency domain equalization
(FDE) [1]-[3] is recently proposed to provide high
data rate under multipath fading environment.
Conventionally, single-carrier modulation systems
are difficult to implement over multipath fading
channels to resolve a large number of the signal paths.
Benefitting from the standardized discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) architecture, the received
single-carrier modulation signal can be transform
into frequency domain by inverse DFT (IDFT)
operation, equalized with low implementation
complexity, then transform back to time domain by
DFT to advert the fading effect. With better
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance
and compatible error performance over orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), CP-SC
modulation system attracts high interests for future
wireless communication systems.
In [4], the orthogonal multiplexed modulation
(OMM) families [5]-[7], including orthogonal
multiplexed orthogonally amplitude modulation
(OMOAM), orthogonal multiplexed orthogonally
phase modulation (OMOPM), on-off-keyed
orthogonal multiplexed orthogonally amplitude
modula t ion (OMO²AM), and on-off-keyed
orthogonal mult iplexed orthogonally phase
modulation (OMO2PM), are combined with adaptive
modulation to pursue higher system throughput over
OFDM. With the same intent, we explore the benefits
that the CP-SC architecture can provide for adaptive
OMM (AOMM) systems. The spectral performance
of the adaptive CP-SC-OMM (ACP-SC-OMM) is
analyzed under imperfect channel estimation in this
report.
二、Introduction
In order to quench the thirst for the data
transmission rate, modern wireless communication
systems aim at serving hundreds Mb/s data rate
based on the OFDM systems to alleviate multipath
fading. Meanwhile, the adoption of cyclic prefix (CP)
also eliminates the inter-symbol interference (ISI)
effect. Such wireless communication systems, e.g.
IEEE 802.16 and ETSI HiperLan, can replace the
tranditional costly wireline communication systems
and can be applied to reach non-line-of-sight users.
OFDM became a popular technique until 90'
due to the matuarity of the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) technique which is adopted to process signal
in the frequency domain. Whereas, comparing to
OFDM, single carrier (SC) modulation system with
time domain equalization is difficult to provide high
data rate under a channel with several micro seconds
delay spread, since such delay spread results in ISI
across hundreds of symbols resulting in extremely
high path resolving computation effort. Thus, SC
modulation systems are neglected gradually.
Although OFDM is an effective technique to
advert ISI, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
is a serious problem for the OFDM signal. It is well

with  being the roll-off factor. For design
convenience, the parameters N, M, L and Nx are
constrained throughout to be nonnegative powers of
two, though such constraint is not prerequisite for
general OMM signaling formats.

Assume the received signal is perfectly
synchronized in amplitude, phase, symbol timing,
and frequency by the receiver. As shown in Fig. 1,
the received signal can be demodulated by the
standard discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based
OFDM demodulation process to yield
{ | }n NY nZ , the time index is dropped without
loss of generality. Here, nY is the received complex

The zero-forced signal    /n n nnR B W X 
is then sent for data detection. When γ is perfectly
measured by the channel status estimator, the
maximum-likelihood decision algorithms that have
been designed in [5]-[7] for the AWGN channel can
be directly applied on { | }n NR nZ , to determine
the detected supersymbols ,{ | }m i Mm Z .
The two-ray fading channel is modeled by
X(z)=p+q(z-τ).
with p and q denoting the complex channel
gains corresponding to the first path and the delayed
path on integer delay τ. Here, p and q are modeled to 
be independent circularly symmetric complex
Gaussian noise samples with means
E{p}=[Ω/(1+Ω)]1/2 and E{q}=0 and variances
Var{p}=E{|p-E{p}|²}=(1+Ω) ⁻¹(1+Λ⁻¹) ⁻¹ and
Var{q}=E{|q|²}=(1+Ω)⁻¹(1+Λ)⁻¹. By modeling so, p
and q represent Rician and Rayleigh paths,
respectively, where Ω denotes the ratio of the direct 
power (i.e., |E{p}|²) to the sum of diffuse powers (i.e.,
Var{p}+Var{q}) and Λ is the ratio of difuse powers 
given by Λ=Var{p}/Var{q}.
Fig. 2 shows BER comparison for time and
frequency domain multiplexed CP-OMM systems
with zero-forcing equalization when N=1024, L=1,
and K=4 under two ray Rayleigh fading channel. The
time domain multiplexing schemes are with marks,
and the frequency domain multiplexing schemes are
with no mark for the ratio of direct powerΩbeing 0,
3, and 7. WhenΩis large, time domain multiplexing
schemes outperforms the frequency domain
multiplexing schemes. Also, time domain
multiplexing scheme with M=2048 (full multiplex)
outperforms the corresponding frequency domain
multiplexing scheme, which is primarily due to the
multipath diversity can be achieved fully for time
domain multiplexing schemes.
Fig. 3 shows BER comparison for
frequency-interleaved time and frequency domain
multiplexed OMM systems with multiple access and
zero-forcing equalization when N=128, L=1, and
K=4 under subcarrier flat Rayleigh fading channel.
When the SNR increases, the BEP of time domain
multiplexing scheme outperform the corresponding
frequency domain multiplexing schemes, but when
SNR is low, frequency domain multiplexing schemes
performs better than the time domain multiplexing
schemes.
Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
comparison between time and frequency domain
multiplexing for OMOAM is shown in Fig. 4.
Similar result is also observed for OMOPM,
OMO²AM, and OMO²PM. Apparently, time domain
multiplexed schemes possesses much lower PAPR
than the frequency domain multiplexed schemes. At
least 8 dB gain can be observed for OTMOAM
schemes with 16QAM over 128OFDM/16QAM.
When the number of subcarriers is larger, PAPR of
the OTMOAM schemes remains almost the same,
but the frequency domain multiplexed schemes
degrades seriously.
四、Adaptive CP-OMM
In this section, flat fading is considered. Since
the error performance and spectral efficiency are
identical for both time and frequency domain
multiplexed CP-OMM signals under flat fading, the
PSA-AOMM systems with frequency domain

Now, the spectral performance of PSA
ACP-SC-OMM systems is provided as follows. Fig.

ACP-SC-OMOAM with N=4, 8, and 16,
510 ,TBER
 ℘=0.99, / 1 /16,pT T  and
max 16K  . The degradation caused by MMSE is
examined for γ=5 and 20 dB. Obviously, when the 
channel is favorable, the MMSE cause minor impact
over average spectral efficiency, and only few taps of
MMSE estimator is required to estimate the channel
gain. But when the channel turns hostile, say γ=5, 
around 16 taps of the MMSE estimator is required to
confine the degradation of average spectral efficiency
within 15%. Additionally, the PSA ACP-SC-
OMOAM system with different signal dimension has
similar variation in average spectral efficiency. The
PSA ACP-SC-OMOAM system with higher N
provides better average spectral efficiency than that
with lower N when γ is very low or very high. Thus, 
the variation in average spectral efficiency is small
for the moderate γ region.
When the power efficiencies of the adaptable
signals are not changed, the variation in average
spectral efficiency is indistinguishable as shown in
Figs. 6 and 7 for varying the parameters℘and maxK
which affect only the spectral efficiencies of the
adaptable signals, with N=8, 510 ,TBER
 and
/ 1 /16.pT T 
Fig. 8 shows the impact of pilot signal over
average spectral efficiency for the ACP-SC-OMM
schemes with N = 8, 510 ,TBER
 ℘ = 0.99,
/ 1 /16,pT T  and max 16K  for AOFDM/QAM,
ACP-SC-OMOAM, and ACP-SC-OMO2AM, and
max 256K  for AOFDM/PSK, ACP-SC-OMOPM,
and ACP-SC-OMO2PM. Since the average spectral
efficiency under estimation error in channel gain is
uniformly degraded from that with perfect channel
gain estimation, the scheme with higher average
spectral efficiency with perfect channel gain
estimation exhibits lower variation in average
spectral efficiency.
五、Conclusion
In this report, CP-SC architecture is applied
over AOMM system. Imperfect channel effect is also
explored for ACP-SC-OMM systems. Five basis sets
are proposed to unify conventional frequency-
domain multiplexing OMM and CP-SC-OMM. The
impact of imperfect channel estimation is also
explored that the ACP-SC-OMM scheme with higher
average spectral efficiency with perfect channel gain
estimation exhibits lower variation in average
spectral efficiency.
