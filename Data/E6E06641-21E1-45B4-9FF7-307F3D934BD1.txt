二、英文摘要 
How to reuse the sludge ash resource in the 
replacement for part of the cementitious 
material has recently become a hot research 
topic. Different research reports have proved 
that it is beneficial for the environmental 
protection by applying various kinds of sludge 
ash to cement mortar. However, effects of 
sludge ash on the compressive strength of 
mortar were emphasized for the related 
researches. Volumetric stability of sludge ash 
cement mortar is overlooked. In this study, 
different types of sludge ash will substitute 
for part of cement and nano-SiO2 is added to 
mortar. Then, effects of different materials on 
volume expansion of mortar are investigated. 
Then the volume expansion ratios for sludge 
ash cement paste and mortar are examined by 
the measurements of length change, autoclave 
expansion rates, and compressive strength. 
These results are then compared with those 
obtained from micro analysis such as SEM 
and TEM. Hence, this study is focus on the 
effects of different types of sludge ash and 
nano-material on the volumetric change of 
mortar. Test results indicate that higher 
amount of Nano-SiO2 added to mortar will 
accelerate the hydration reaction, in which 
this can effectively reduce the pore 
distributions caused by the replacement of 
sludge ashes to cement. Moreover, the weight 
loss on ignition reduce with the increase 
amount of Nano-SiO2 added. The results of 
TGA show that the peaks are observed in 
between 450 and 470°C. The 3% Nano-SiO2 
additive gives the highest autoclave expansion, 
followed by 2% and 1%.  
 
Keywords: Volumetric change, sludge ash,

三、研究背景與動機 
台灣地區經濟蓬勃發展，國民生活水準
也相對提高，每人每日所產生之污染物也隨
之提高，為了達到生態環境永續發展之目
標，必須妥善處置廢棄物、污水處理等問
題，如民生日常生活污水經過污水處理廠處
理過程中所產生之廢棄活化污泥。目前台灣
每日平均約有九萬餘公噸的廢棄污泥產
生，其中包括工業區廢棄污泥及下水污泥，
如此龐大數量之廢棄污泥，勢必得研究開發
並應用各種新穎技術，解決廢棄污泥處置的

Nano 添加量 0%、1%、2%及 3%之波峰大
致相同，並無明顯高低之分；在第六組波峰
處，可看出 Nano 添加量 2%者之 C-S-H 含
量些微高於 Nano 添加量 1%、3%及未添加
者；就整體而言，Nano-SiO2 添加於純水泥
漿體中時，試體內部氫氧化鈣等水化膠體含
量會隨著 Nano 添加量增加而增多，亦可加
速水化反應及改良水泥漿體內部細微結構
排列方式，使試體內部孔隙產生較緻密之現
象，此現象可由 XRD 光譜圖結果證明。

5.2 TGA/DTA 分析 
本研究為利用下水污泥灰取代部分水
泥用量中，並利用 Nano-SiO2 作為改良劑，
以其特性改善污泥灰粒徑顆粒形狀不規則
的所帶來負面之影響。圖 2(a)、2(b))分別為
添加 2%之 Nano-SiO2 及污泥取代量 10%、
20%之下水污泥灰漿體，由圖中可發現污泥
取代量 10%時，溫度大致於 70℃~480℃
時，其重量損失約為 20%，當污泥取代量增
加為 20%時，重量損失 13%；熱差分析(DTA)
而言，不同配比於同溫度下之表現，相同
Nano-SiO2 添加量之下，污泥取代量 10%
時，其波峰高於污泥取代量 20%。藉此可知
添加Nano-SiO2可提高C-S-H及氫氧化鈣等
水化產物之數量，但隨著污泥取代量愈高，
其重量損失數量亦愈少，此現象說明，此
時，污泥灰漿體中的氫氧化鈣含量隨著污泥
取代量增加而減少，因此出現較趨緩之重量
損失趨勢。

5.3 NMR 分析 
    由文獻中得知，Nano-SiO2 具有細小化
及促進水化產物生長之特性，因此本章節將
針對純水泥漿體、污泥取代量 20%及
Nano-SiO2 添加量 2%之漿體進行 29Si 光譜
試驗，比較不同材料下單礦物 C2S 及單礦物
C3S 所組成之 C-S-H 膠體之差異。由圖 3 中
可發現，Nano-SiO2 添加量 2%及污泥取代
量 20%之NMR光譜圖中出現三組較明顯的
波 峰 ， Q1 出 現 位 置 約 為 偵 測 範 圍

整，因此可以推測此物質為水化產物下的
C-S-H 膠體，此物質即為水泥抗壓強度之主
要來源，但就體積變化而言，試體若長時間
處置於水分充足或水中時，試體隨著時間增
加，其水化產物將呈現持續吸水狀況，因此
C-S-H 膠體吸水反應後，導致試體體積產生
持續膨脹現象。

藉由圖 5 與圖 6 相較之下可發現，添加
Nano-SiO2可促進水泥/污泥漿體中C-S-H膠
體、鈣钒石及矽酸鈣等水化產物生成較完
整，覆蓋性亦較佳，且膠體吸水現象亦較明
顯，因此試體體積則呈現持續少量膨脹之現
象，但層片狀物質則會隨著污泥取代量增加
而減少；當 Nano-SiO2 添加量為 1%時，可
看出少數半透明小球狀物質於 C-S-H 膠體
四周，此物質可使原本呈現鬆散、不規則、
獨立性的結構慢慢轉變為聚集之緊密狀，且
由圖中發現 Nano-SiO2 具有填補試體孔隙，
並且可與結構體產生緊密狀況，減少試體之
孔隙。 
 
5.6 體積變化率分析 
由圖 7(c)中可看出，添加 Nano-SiO2 之純水
泥漿體，其體積膨脹變化大致為 0.013%~ 
0.029%，就整體而言，體積膨脹率會隨著污
泥取代量增加而愈大，其體積膨脹率大小依
序排序為 0%>5%>10%>15%>20%，並且可
發現添加量增加為 2%時，各個不同污泥取
代量之試體出現較明顯之差異，第 3 天時，
相差範圍大致介於 0.001%~0.003%，第 91
天時，大致介於 0.006%~0.003%；添加量為
3%時，可發現體積膨脹最大者仍為污泥取
代量 20%，最小者為純水泥漿體，但有別於
添加量 1%、2%之處，五種不同污泥取代量
之體積變化率幾乎接近，且由圖 7 (d)中可
看出試體於第 3 天時，其體積膨脹變化最為
急速，最高者為 0.016%，最低者為 0.013%。
養置齡期至第 14 天後，其膨脹變化逐漸趨
緩。第 91 天，污泥取代量 0%、5%、10%、
15%及 20%之體積變化率分別為 0.032%、
0.032%、0.033%、0.035%及 0.036%，且由
圖中可發現 Nano-SiO2 添加量愈大，試體於
第 3 天時，體積膨脹變化會愈明顯，但隨著
養護時間增加，仍會呈現持續少量膨脹的現
象。

為為近年來熱門討論之課題。因此，利用不
同奈米材料與污泥灰對漿體體積變化之差
異作為研究重點。研究結果如下 
1.經由 XRD 光譜圖及 NMR29Si 光譜比較圖
中可發現，C-S-H 及氫氧化鈣(CH)及 Si
含量將隨著污泥灰細度愈小、添加
Nano-SiO2 比例愈高，可加速其水化反

Abstract In light of the drawbacks caused by sludge ash replacement in mortar, the previous studies have 
shown that adding nano-SiO2 to mortar improves the early strength and durability of sludge ash/cement 
mortar. In this article, three types of nano-SiO2, SS, HS, and SP, were applied to sludge ash/cement mixture 
to make paste or mortar specimens. The object is to further extend the recycling of the sludge ash by 
determining the best type of nano-SiO2 additive to improve the properties of sludge ash/cement paste or 
mortar. The cement was replaced by 0, 10, 20, or 30% sludge ash with 0 or 2% nano-SiO2 in sludge ash 
paste or mortar specimens. Tests such as setting time, compressive strength, SEM, XRD, NMR, and 
TGA/DTA were performed in this study. Test results show that nano-SiO2 additives can not only effectively 
increase the hydration product, C-S-H gel, but also make the crystal structure denser. Among the three types 
of nano-SiO2 additive, SS type can best improve the properties of sludge ash/cement paste or mortar, 
followed by the SP and HS types. 
 
Keywords cement, mortar, nano-material, paste, sewage sludge ash  
 
INTRODUCTION 
Recently, methods to increase the recycling and reuse of different wastes for practical applications 
has been widely researched. Study of the recycling of sewage sludge is one of these topics. Kula et 
al. (2001) found that, when a great amount of cement was replaced by sludge ash, lower 
compressive strength of specimens was observed. Moreover, the properties and strength of 
specimens were also affected by parameters such as temperature and curing conditions. Valls el al. 
(2001, 2004) pointed out that the setting times were delayed when cement was replaced by more 
than 10% sludge ash. Furthermore, the flexure deflections of specimens increased with the 
increasing amount of sludge ash replacement. They also noticed that the density of mortar 
decreased, and the void ratio and absorption coefficient increased with the increase of sludge ash 
replacement. Since the addition of the sludge ash to specimens would change the properties of those 
specimens, some researcher have added nano-materials to sludge/ash mixture to ameliorate 
drawbacks such as decrease in compressive strength. Constantinides et al. (2003) proved that the 
micro sawtooth-like appearance of the cementitious materials can be produced using 
nano-techniques. By doing this, the physical and chemical properties of the cementitious materials 
were changed. Moreover, the C-S-H gel produced would have its own mechanical properties. Wang 
et al. (2003) added nano-SiO2 to Portland cement mortar and better properties of mortar were 
obtained. The optimum amount of nano-SiO2 additive was between 5 and 6%. Li (2004) added 
nano-SiO2 to high volume fly ash concrete. Since fly ash would lower the initial activity in the 
mixture, however, the addition of nano-SiO2 could increase the pozzolanic activity. This implies 
that nano-SiO2 can activate the fly ash. 
As reviewed in the above literature, it is possible to apply nano-SiO2 to improve the properties of 
sludge ash/cement paste or mortar. However, many different kinds of nano-material are seen in the 
market. In this research, the best type of nano-SiO2 in improving the properties of sludge 
ash/cement paste or mortar is examined. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Materials 
1. Cement: Locally made, type I Portland cement with specific gravity equal to 3.15 was used for 
 3
(2). Compressive strength test: In order to evaluate the influences of different types of nano-SiO2 
additive on the strength development of specimens, a universal testing machine was applied to find 
the compressive strengths of specimens when cured for 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 91 days. 
(3). Microscopic examination: In order to observe the micro-structural behaviors of specimens’ 
surface, the microscopic examinations explained below were applied for this study. The scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the hydrate productions of specimens. Moreover, 
the amount of hydration products could be derived by measuring the reaction frequencies of 
products by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The variations in thermal reactivity for specimens are 
examined by applying the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and differential thermal analyzer 
(DTA). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Physical properties  
Figure 1 shows the amount of water used in the paste specimens for different mix designs. Since the 
amount of cement replaced by sludge ash was based on the weight percentage and sludge ash had 
smaller specific gravity, the amount of water used in the paste increased with the increase amount of 
sludge ash replacement. Moreover, with the addition of 2% nano-SiO2 additives to the paste 
specimens with 20% sludge ash replacement, the amount of water used in the paste increased 
noticeably. The water increase resulted from the fact that nano-SiO2 additives have larger specific 
areas. Furthermore, since nano-SiO2 was applied as an additive to the paste, the amount of water 
also increased with the quantity of nano-SiO2 added.  
A delay in setting time for paste with 20% sludge ash replacement was noticed, as shown in figure 2. 
However, earlier initial and final setting times were observed for 20% sludge ash/cement paste with 
2% nano-SiO2 additives. Since nano-SiO2 has very small particle size and large specific surface 
area, this gives better water absorption and faster setting for paste. Hence, the initial and final 
setting times were shortened for sludge ash/cement paste with 2% nano-SiO2 additives. The HS 
type of nano-SiO2 additive was best for improving both the initial and setting times (about 105 
minutes), followed by the SP and SS types of nano-SiO2 additives. Furthermore, though 
microporous particles, such as SP type nano-SiO2, can lead to a larger specific surface area, test 
results indicate that the improvement in setting time was not notable compared with the HS type, 
which is comprised of spherical particles. Hence, not only does the specific area of nano-SiO2 
affected the setting time of past, but also the amount of hydroxyl group in nano-SiO2.

specimens for different mix designs.

ash/cement paste with different types of 
nano-SiO2 additive.
Compressive strength   
The relationship between compressive strength and different amounts of sludge ash replacement is 
 5
additives to mortar contrasting with the cost of nano-SiO2 should be further evaluated. Figure 6 
shows the compressive strengths of specimens with 30% sludge ash replacement and 2% nano-SiO2 
additives. Though the SS and SP types of nano-SiO2 additives can slightly improve the compressive 
strength, the HS type of nano-SiO2 additive had a negative influence on the compressive strengths 
of mortar specimens.  
SEM analysis    
Figure 7 displays the SEM pictures for paste specimens with 20% sludge ash replacement. As seen 
in figure 7(a), lots of pores were noticed in the paste structure. This may lead to a decrease in the 
compressive strength of specimens. Moreover, small amount of calcium hydroxide crystals were 
also produced, which did not help with filling the pores in the paste. However, after the addition of 
2% nano-SiO2 to the paste, more pores were filled up, especially for nano-SiO2 SS type as shown in 
figure 7(b). More calcium hydroxide crystals were generated and these crystals became smaller due 
to the addition of nano-SiO2. Hence, a better pore filling result was observed and fine pores in the 
paste were effectively reduced. Furthermore, similar phenomena were observed for the SP and HS 
types of nano-SiO2 though the pore filling effects were less pronounced, as shown in figures 7(c) 
and 7(d).

XRD analysis    
As studied by Luo et al. (2007), a decrease in peak values for both C-S-H gel and calcium 
hydroxide was noticed when part of cement was replaced by sludge ash. This implies that the 
hydration reaction in the paste was influenced by the sludge ash, especially when more than 20% of 
cement was replaced by sludge ash. Therefore, less hydration products were produced, which lead 
to a decrease in strength of specimens. However, the nano-SiO2 SS type can noticeably increase the 
production of C-S-H gel, followed by the SP and HS types, as shown in figure 8(for 2θ at about 27 
degrees). Hence, the nano-SiO2 SS type could improve the strength of the paste.

TGA/DTA analysis 
The results of TGA/DTA for specimens with 20% sludge ash replacement and 2% nano-SiO2 
additives are shown in figure 10. An endothermic reaction was noticed at temperatures between 400
℃ and 450℃ as seen in figure 10(a) to 10(d). This suggests that the water of hydration in the 
calcium hydroxide was gradually dissipated at this range of temperatures. As more water of 
hydration was dissipated, the amount of calcium hydroxide increased. Figures 10(a) to 10(d) also 
indicate the weight loss of paste specimens. The weight loss for sludge ash/cement paste was about 
15%; 17% for specimens with SS type nano-SiO2 additive; 15% for specimens with HS type 
nano-SiO2 additive; 17% for specimens with SP type nano-SiO2 additive. Hence, when nano-SiO2 
additive was added to specimens, more hydration product was generated and the weight loss of 
water in crystals was also increased. On the other hand, less hydration product was produced for 
sludge ash/cement paste and the weight loss of water in crystals was also less. The above 
observations are consistent with the results obtained for compressive strength. This implies that, 
when the amount of cement replaced by the sludge ash is less than 20%, the addition of SS type 
nano-SiO2 additive to paste can effectively improve the compressive strength of specimens, 
followed by SP and HS types of nano-SiO2 additives.
