ABSTRACT 
Three series of tests on model slopes with various scales were conducted using artificial 
rainfall facilities, to explore internal and external responses of shallow sandy slopes subjected to 
rainfall infiltration. For all tests reported here. an identical silty sand was used as the slope 
material. The study features spatially and temporally uniform rainfall, debris discharge collection, 
soil moisture and porewater pressure measure ments. Soil moisture and porewater pressure 
responses in slopes were used to correlate the internal soil moisture and piezometric responses 
and the external debris discharge. The observed retrogressive slope failure was triggered by a toe 
failure, followed by an abruptly increase in debris discharge. The onset of the failure was 
preceded by a clear transition point on the soil moisture vs. time curve at the soil-bedrock 
interface. Both external and internal responses of slopes to rainfall can be expressed using widely 
adopted I-D (rainfall intensity-duration) plots. Experimental results from the tests indicate close 
relationships between the internal-based and external-based I-D envelopes for critical slope states. 
A theory of the internal-response-based rainfall criterion for predicting slope failure is proposed 
based on artificial rainfall tests for a sandy slope. The theory proposed here is useful to increase 
the accuracy of slope failure predictions. Results of finite element analyses for model slope tests 
show that the seepage process in unsaturated slope can be well-simulated based on the measured 
soil characteristic curves, if the boundary condition change at the slope toe is properly taken into 
account.

model incorporating the above key features is required for a better prediction of slope failures. 
Numerous studies have investigated the initiation mechanism of debris avalanches and debris flows using 
field monitoring systems (Iverson and Major, 1987; Johnson and Sitar, 1990; Berti et al., 1999, 2000; Tecca 
et al., 2003; Mikos, et al., 2004), field observations and laboratory soil testing (Anderson and Sitar, 1995; Dai 
et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2003; Wen and Aydin, 2005; Gabet and Mudd, 2006; Matsushi et al., 2006; Lacerda, 
2007; Godt and Coe, 2007; Coe et al., 2008; Pelfini and Santilli 2008), reduced-scaled model slope tests 
(Iverson et al., 1997; Okura et al., 2002; Lourenco et al., 2006), and analytical methods (Iverson and Reid, 
1992; Reid and Iverson, 1992). Other studies have investigated the mechanisms of movement and deposition 
of flowslides (Hird and Hassona, 1990; Spence and Guymer, 1997; Major and Iverson, 1999; Wang and Sassa, 
2001, 2003; Marr et al., 2002; Ilstad et al., 2004; May and Gresswell, 2004). The above studies generally 
show that the patterns of soil moisture content and porewater pressure control the behavior of fast-moving 
mass flow, including traveling speed and distance as well as the deposition pattern. However, relatively few 
implications regarding the porewater pressure patterns were obtained in these studies. Physically based 
models that relate shallow slope failures and debris flows to rainfall from a broad area larger than 104 m2 
have been developed by Barling et al. (1994), Montgomery and Dietrich (1994), Wu and Sidle (1995), 
Gorsevski et al. (2006), Meisina and Scarabelli (2007), and Deb and El-Kadi (2009). These models rendered 
generally good spatial and temporal indications of slopes with high potential of failures. However, the 
applicability of these models in better predicting the initiation of fast-moving mass flow using meteorological 
data is yet to be examined. 
There have also been some experimental and analytical studies on the mechanism of rainfall-induced slope 
failures (e.g., Okimura and Ichikawa, 1985; Iseda and Tanabashi, 1986; Collins and Znidarcic, 2004; Zhang 
et al., 2005; Hφydal and Heyerdahl, 2006). These studies revealed a close interdependency between wetting 
front propagation and slope instability. However, the definition of ‘slope failure’ in the above studies was not 
always clear, because a quantitative indicator of the failure such as the volume of debris discharge was 
unknown. Relating the initiation of fast-moving mass flows to a quantitative indicator of the potential failure 
mass is essential for minimizing the uncertainties of empirical ‘rainfall thresholds’ (e.g., Caine, 1980; Cannon 
and Ellen, 1985; Keefer et al., 1987; Jan and Lee, 2004; Aleotti, 2004). Studies relating internal soil moisture 
or piezometric responses to external responses (i.e., the rate of debris discharge from retrogressive slope 
failures) are very limited. Huang et al. (2008, 2009), however, proposed a prototype of ‘internal soil moisture 
and porewater pressure response envelope’ under a commonly adopted rainfall intensity (I) vs. duration (D) 
framework, based on artificial rainfall tests on both reduced-scale and large-scale sand slopes. Their results 
highlighted some fundamental elements for a generic model describing the internal and external processes of 
shallow slope failures, including the key roles of interflow along the soil-bedrock interface, and the 
mounding of porewater pressure adjacent to the transition point for slope failures. However, there were 
deficiencies of the test set-up in their studies such as the lack of direct measurement of debris discharge and 
that of piezometric measurement. To obtain a more complete slope failure scenario, we performed artificial 
rainfall tests with intensive soil moisture, piezometric, and debris discharge measurements using model slope 
test facilities.   
 
3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
Three different scales of model slopes using an identical sandy soil were built and were brought to failure 
using temporally and spatially uniform artificial rainfall. The artificial rainfall system consisted of a water 
tank, a flowmeter, a water pump, and regularly aligned sprinklers. The intensity and uniformity of rainfall 
were calibrated prior to each test using 50 beakers with a top diameter of 50 mm, placed 100 mm apart along 
the impermeable base of the slope. The results of rainfall intensity calibration indicated that uniformity 
coefficients (Uc) were between 85% and 90%, which are considered acceptable. Figs. 1-3 show cross sections 
of slopes reported here. The small-scale, large-scale, and medium-scale model slope tests are described 
in-detail by Huang et al. (2008). Huang et al. (2009), and Huang and Yuin (2010), respectively. Locations of 
soil moisture sensors and piezometers are also shown. Note that an identical sand was used in all tests 
described here. The dry densities range between 15 and 17 kN m-3 (or e between 0.7 and 0.8). The bin of 
small and medium scale models had debris discharge collection funnels immediately below the slope toe. The 
debris collection bucket beneath the funnel was replaced during the artificial rainfall test at variable rates of

Figure 6 shows experimental SWCCs for the same sand under various void ratios (e), experssed using Eq. 
(1) with various curve fitting parameters a, n and m. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of three hydraulic 
conductivity (ku) vs. matric suction (ψ) for the case of e = 0.7. These curves were derived based on the 
experimental curves of θ vs. (ψ), incoporated with various theoretical equations of ku vs. θ proposed by 
VanGenuten (1980), Green and Corey (1971) and Fredlund and Rahardjo (1993). It can be seen that the 
deviation of ku between various theories increases with increasing matric suctions. Fig. 8 shows ku vs. ψ 
functions for various void ratios (e = 0.7, 0.75, 0.809, 0.85) of sand derived based on the SWCC from 
Fredlund and Xing (1994), and the ku vs. θ from Fredlund and Rahardjo (1993). 
 
5. TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
Test results and discussions in this section are based on the medium-scale model slope tests reported by 
Huang and Yuin (2010). Fig. 9(a) shows the progress of slope failures in terms of the distance of the scarp 
from the slope toe (S). For three curves obtained, rapid increases of S from certain threshold times can be 
seen. The slope of these rapid rising segments increases with increasing rainfall intensity. Fig. 9(b) shows the 
degree of retrogressive failure in terms of the percentage of the wasted volume of solids to the total solid 
volume of the slope (Pv) when subjected to various rainfall intensities (I). Distinct trends of mass wasting 
(debris or discharge) as a function of rainfall intensity can be seen. It can also be seen that the curves have a 
flat segment at the early stage, followed by an abrupt increase in the rate of debris discharge. The rate of 
debris discharge increases with increasing I. The transition time from a minor discharging rate to a large one, 
tin, is called ‘the time of inflection or transition point on the Qs vs. t curve’, representing a critical moment of 
the failure-induced debris discharge. Therefore, identifying tin is important in forecasting (and also preventing) 
a disaster involving fast-moving mass flows from shallow slope failures. This is examined further below. 
Fig. 10 shows typical front views of the slope subjected to I = 47 mm hr-1 at t = 0, 103.3, and 133.1 min, 
representing various critical moments of the rainfall-induced slope failures. Fig. 10(b) shows that at the time 
of the transition point of the Qs vs. t curve (tin = 103.3 min.), a clear sign of the slope toe wash-out occurs. 
Retrogressive failure of the slope can be seen in Fig. 10(b),(c) for Pv = 0.5%, and 5%, respectively. These 
figures all indicate that the retrogressive failure occurred with an uppermost scarp approximately parallel to 
the line of the slope toe; i.e., the slope failed in an approximate two-dimensional manner, confirming the 
results of Huang et al. (2008, 2009). Fig. 11 shows developments of retrogressive failure surfaces at various 
critical times for the slopes subjected to I = 47 mm hr-1, based on the images recorded by digital cameras. 
Similar retrogressive failures as those shown in Fig. 11 have also been reported by Bejrrum (1967), for 
overly-consolidated natural clay slopes; Skempton and Hutchinson (1969) for natural slopes consisting of 
colluviums underlain by mudrocks; and Eckersley (1990) as well as Wang and Sassa (2001, 2003) in 
laboratory flowslide tests using sandy soils as test median. 
 
5-1. Internal moisture response against rainfall infiltration 
Fig. 12 shows contours for the degree of saturation (Sr) at two critical moments for the slope subjected to I 
= 47 mm hr-1. The degree of saturation Sr ≥ 90% is referred to as a ‘fully saturated condition’. This is based 
on the results of calibration box tests, which show that due to the air trapped in the voids, a ground water 
table develops in the zone of Sr ≥ 90%. The existence of a ground water table is usually deemed to be the 
result of a fully saturated state (Sr = 100%) in conventional geotechnical engineering practice. It can also be 
seen that the lines of Sr ≥ 90% first developed around the transition point of bedrock slopes (Fig. 12a) and 
then spread out into the zone of the slope toe (Fig. 12b), causing a noticeable slope toe failure. 
NSC96-2628-E-006-259-MY3 .doc                                                  2010-10-05 6
used here. It can also be seen that the response time (×4) always occurs slightly before tin, indicating the 
potential of using Tmp obtained at M4 (0.9, 0) (represented by ‘×4’) and Tm1 (represented by ‘×3’) obtained at 
that point as accurate and conservative indicators, respectively, for the onset of slope failure. Fig. 18 shows a 
plot similar to that in Fig. 17, except that it uses the response time based on the porewater pressure measured 
at P2 (0.9, 0), namely, Tw1 (denoted by ‘×1’) and Twp (denoted by ‘×2’). It can be seen that the response time 
(Tw1) obtained from the porewater pressure vs. time curve at P2 (0.9, 0) located near to the transition point of 
the bedrock slope simulates the time of the onset of slope failure (or the onset of abrupt debris discharge). 
However, the response time, Twp, represents the time when the slope failure proceeds to some of Pv ~ 5% for 
the case of I = 65 and 47 mm hr-1 and Pv ~ 7% for the case of I = 23 mm hr-1. Therefore, Twp is considered 
unconservative as an indicator for the onset of an abrupt debris discharge induced by a slope failure. 
 
5-4. Mechanisms model of shallow slope failures 
The proposed conceptual model for the internal and external responses of model sandy slopes subjected to 
rainfall is shown in Fig. 19. Arrows with dotted lines signify the wetting front propagation in the unsaturated 
flow field; arrows with solid lines signify the saturated interflow propagation and the phreatic table 
development. The symbols c, d, e, f, and g represent the beginning of rainfall infiltration, the arrival 
of wetting front at the impermeable bedrock-soil interface, the propagation of interflow along the saturated 
soil-bedrock interface, the arrival of interflow at the point of bedrock slope transition, and the critical height 
of the water table, respectively. d can be simulated by Tm1 obtained along the soil-bedrock interface; e and 
f can be simulated by Tmp and/or Tw1 obtained along the soil-bedrock interface. It is conceivable that d ~ 
e ~ f because once the wetting front reaches the bedrock, the interflow propagates downward with a high 
flow velocity in the saturated field. Furthermore, at f, the saturated flow along the bedrock field is 
connected to the slope surface infiltration; the infiltrated water arrives at the toe in a short period of time due 
to a relatively high permeability of the saturated soil-bedrock interface. A similar observation was made by 
Torres et al. (1998) on the unsaturated flow field of a natural slope induced by artificial rainfall. They found a 
rapid response of porewater pressure in the slope subjected to a spike increase of rainfall when the 
unsaturated zone, the saturated zone and the discharge were linked. This is the case in the present study, in 
that a constant rate of debris (water + solid) discharge occurs when the saturated interflow is linked to the 
slope surface infiltration. The link of the slope toe zone to the surface infiltration results in an increased 
soil-bedrock interflow rate and a significant mounding of the water table or flooding, partially due to the 
slowdown of flow velocity around the point of bedrock slope reduction. g represents a relatively steady 
phreatic table condition valid for the condition of Pv ≥ 5%. From the test results shown in Figs. 17 and 18 
and those reported by Huang et al. (2008, 2009), the critical moments of slope failure (tin) are consistently 
close to e and f, represented by Tmp or Tw1 obtained along the soil-bedrock interface. Therefore, Tmp or Tw1 
along the interface can be an accurate predictor of slope failure, and Tm1 along the interface can be a 
conservative precursor for the onset of shallow slope failure (tin). The proposed conceptual model is also 
valid in the case of natural slopes consisting of weathered granite and volcanic rocks as reported by Jiao et al. 
(2005) who found a chair-shaped saturated zone called the high hydraulic conductivity zone between the 
topsoil and the bedrock. This zone has high water pressure which causes low slope stability in response to 
rainfall. The chair-shaped saturated zone is comparable to the zone of interflow along the bi-linear bedrock 
used in the proposed model. 
 
5-5. Significance of internal and external I-D envelopes 
Fig. 20(a) shows I vs. D plots for meteorology-based thresholds widely adopted in predicting slope 
failures (Caine, 1980; Cancelli and Nova, 1985; Wieczorek, 1987; and Crosta, 1998). The upper bound by 
Caine (1980) and the upper limit of the data by Crosta (1998) are also plotted for comparison. In general, 
these threshold I-D relationships vary widely, suggesting that a high degree of uncertainty is always 
associated in using these empirical relationships. Critical moments regarding the slope failure (or debris 
discharge) obtained in the present study, namely, tin, t5%, and t15% (the time of Pv = 0.5%, 5%, and 15%, 
NSC96-2628-E-006-259-MY3 .doc                                                  2010-10-05 8
debris discharge is necessary. 
 
6. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS 
Figure 25 shows a cross setion for the FEM seepage analysis (SEEP/W) for the medium-scale slope. 
Figures 26(a)-26(d) show typical analytical results, expressed by contours of degree of saturation at t = 70 
min., 80 min., 90 min., and 103 min., respectively. These times correspond to some significant moments of 
the slope subjected to rainfall. Figs. 26(a) and 26(b) show that at t = 70 min. and 80 min., positive 
piezometric heads were found only around the toe of the slope.  Nearly saturated zones occur at the top and 
the bottom of the slope. It is noted in Fig. 26(c) that the zones of Sr = 100% near the top and the bottom of 
the slope seem to be connected; since then a major flooding at the bottom of the slope in the form of high 
piezometric head at the bottom occurred, as seen in Figs. 26(c) and 26(d). At t = 103 min., a significantly 
higher piezometric than the measured one head line is obtained from the analysis. This is due to the 
unrealistic boundary used in the analysis. At t = 103 min., the toe of the slope experienced substantial local 
wash-out. This was ignored in the analysis and is to be discussed further later.    
  Figures 27(a) and 27(b) shows experimental and simulated ω vs. t curves in the case of I = 47 mm/hr for 
distances from the toe, S = 0.28 m and S = 0.9 m, respectively. Fig. 27(a) shows that the calculated ω vs. t 
curve for M 1 stays close to the measured one at early stage of rainfall during which an abrupt increase of ω 
occurs. Fig. 27(b) shows that for M 6, M 5, and M 4 at upper, middle, and lower positions, respectively, of a 
vertical section at S = 0.9 m, critical times, in terms of the time of abrupt rising of ω, and the time of attaining 
Sγ = 100%, are all close to the calculated ones, although the slope of the abrupt rising segment are somewhat 
gentle than the measured ones. Fig. 28 shows a comparison of measured and calculated values of porewater 
pressure (u) vs. t curves. Good agreements, in terms of critical times of abrupt increase of u, can be seen. 
However, the calculated values of u tend to become overestimated after specific times.  This overestimated 
value of u comes from ignoring the toe wash-out-induced boundry changes, as mentioned earlier. Fig. 28 also 
shows that the agreement between the experimental and the simulated responses of u are greatly improved, 
by taking into account the progressive wash-away of the slope toe.   
  Figures 29(a)-(c) show contours of degree of saturation (Sr) at t = 80, 103, and 133 min. The reason of 
choosing t = 80 min. as first step of element adjustment is based on the observation for a minor toe wash-out 
at t = 74 min. Starting from t = 80 min., two elements were erased from the analysis in every two minutes. 
This approximates the observation of retrogressive failures. As a result, calculated piezometric lines are 
greatly modified and are relatively well-agreed with the measured ones, when comparing with those shown 
previously. 
 
7. CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 
Conventional meteorology-based predictions on rainfall-induced shallow slope failure intrinsically have 
high uncertainty. To improve the accuracy of slope failure predictions, a generic model that describes the 
geomorphologic process of slope failures and debris discharge is necessary. This requires a better 
understanding of the internal-response-based slope failure mechanisms. Artificial rainfall tests on three 
different scales of model sandy slopes, incorporating extensive soil moisture and porewater pressure 
measurements and a debris discharge collection system were performed here, to quantitatively relate the 
internal and external responses of the slopes to rainfall. We also performed a comparative study on the 
mechanism of rainfall-induced slope failures using the obtained results and those from both reduced-scale 
and large-scale artificial rainfall tests. A novel theory of internal response envelopes was proposed based on 
the widely adopted I vs. D framework, using the experimental evidence that the internal soil moisture and 
piezometric response envelopes obtained along the bedrock are closely related to the critical moments of the 
rainfall-induced slope failure. This theory will be generalized based on numerical modeling for various slope 
materials, slope and bedrock geometries, and I-D characteristics. 
The following findings can be summarized based on the observations in three series of model slope tests, 
calibration chamber tests and finite element analyses :  
(1) The external response of sandy slopes to rainfall is in the form of retrogressive failure initiated by the 
instability and wash-out of the slope toe. The process of retrogressive failure was characterized by 
distinctive solid discharge curves especially the percentage of total solid volume discharge vs. time

Predictions of rainfall-induced fast-moving mass ﬂow and/or debris ﬂows require better knowledge of the
mechanism controlling the debris discharge of slopes in debris source areas. A series of rainfall tests on 0.32m-
deep, 0.7 m-high, 1.35 m-wide sandy slopes resting on a bi-linear impermeable rigid base was performed. Soil
moisture content and solid dischargemeasurements were performed to gain insights into the rainfall-induced
retrogressive slope failure. The solid (or debris) discharge is a result of thewash-out of theﬂuidized slope toe by
the interﬂow along the soil–bedrock interface. Characteristics of the failure process for the slopes are
represented by mass wasting curves or ‘solid discharge (Qs) vs. time (t)’ curves which are functions of the
rainfall intensity and/or the cumulative rainfall. The mass wasting curves have inﬂection points representing
transitions from minor toe failures into remarkable retrogressive failures. The ﬁrst inﬂection point of the soil
moisture (ω) vs. t curve measured at the soil–bedrock interface signaling the arrival of the descending ‘wet
front’, may serve as a precursor for predicting the onset of an abrupt solid discharge induced by shallow slope
failures. The time of peak water content measured at the soil–bedrock interface may approximate the time of
5% total solid volume discharge. Up to the time of 5% of total slope volume discharge, a fully saturated state
(Sr 100%) was never observed at the 0.2 m-below-surface zone; however, it was observed along the soil–
bedrock interface at near-toe zone of the slope, regardless of the intensity of rainfall investigated. Retrogressive
failures were essentially associated with nonuniformly distributed water content in the slope. For both the
0.2 m-below-surface zone and the soil–bedrock interface, a more uniform distribution of Sr along the full
height of the slope was found for slopes subjected to high rainfall intensities of 47 and 65 mm/h than that for
the slope subjected to a low rainfall intensity of 23 mm/h. At the inﬂection point of the Qs vs. t curve and 5% of
total solid volume discharge, values of Sr at a certain distance from the toe for the soil–bedrock interface were
higher than thosemeasured at the same distance from the toe for the 0.2m-below-surface zone, indicating the
effect of inﬁltration-induced interﬂowalong the soil–bedrock interface and its effects on the ﬂuidization of the
slope toe and the retrogressive failure of the slope.

1. Introduction
Rainfall-induced shallow slope failures are among the most
devastating natural disasters in areas of heavy precipitation (Lumb,
1975; Anderson and Sitar, 1995; Iversion et al., 1997; Dai et al., 1999;
Okura et al., 2002; Cheng et al., 2005; Gabet and Mudd, 2006). Studies
focused on the physical process of slope failures due to rainfall
inﬁltration have been performed using large-scale ﬁeld monitoring
systems, site investigations and analyses, reduce-scaled model tests,
analytical methods and various combinations of the above. Findings in
these studies have often been integrated into disaster mitigation
systems, such as the integrated landslide and debris ﬂow warning
systems reported by Keefer et al. (1987) and Aleotti (2004), and the
hazard assessment system reported by Guadagno et al. (2005). Key
elements of the warning systems include hydrological formulae
relating rainfall and landslide initiation, geo-hydrological properties
of the slopes, and a real-time network of telemetering rain gages.
Keefer et al. (1987) also pointed out that measurements of soil
moisture and pore-water pressure are necessary for providing better
predictions of rainfall–landslide (or debris ﬂow) initiation.
Estimating the potential volume of debris resulting from slope
failures in a debris source area is essential in developing hazard
scenarios and remedial measures (e.g., Hungr et al., 1984; Malet et al.,
2005). Malet et al. (2005) performed seepage analyses to estimate the

the focus. Characteristics of debris discharge that resulted from the
ﬂuidization were not focused.
Mechanisms of slope failure induced by rainfall inﬁltration have
also been studied using unsaturated and/or saturated seepage ﬂow
analysis incorporated with limit-equibrium-based stability analyses
(e.g., Okimura and Ichikawa, 1985; Iverson and Major, 1986; Reid,
1997; Springman et al., 2003; Blatz et al., 2004; Collin and Znidarcic,
2004; Cai and Ugai, 2004; Sako et al., 2006). One of the common
features of the analytical result obtained in these studies is their
deterministic deﬁnitions of slope failure which ignore the fact that
slope failures develop in a progressive manner.
A well-known indicator of progressive slope failure is the ‘move-
ment’ of the slope as summarized by Leroueil (2001). This indicator is
valid for quantifying the degree of damage induced by slow move-
ments of soil mass along speciﬁc failure surfaces (the so-called
‘landslide’). This quantiﬁcation for the extent of slope failure is clearly
different from that for the shallow slope failure which is accompanied
by the wash-away of the slumped mass by the interﬂow along the
soil–bedrock interface and/or the stream ﬂow. Solid discharge from
earth slopes has been extensively studied in the disciplines of
hydraulic engineering and soil–water conservation (e.g., Wörman,
1993; Römkens et al., 2001). These studies focused on particle
movements on the slope surface induced by surface ﬂow or seepage.
Therefore, these results are usually valid for slope erosion under a
globally stable state, and thus are not valid for describing the solid
discharge induced by shallow slope failures. Characteristics of slope-
failure-induced solid discharge for slopes in a debris source area are
fundamentally important in deﬁning debris ﬂow initiation. The
present study focuses on the solid discharge process of individual
slopes associated with internal moisture changes due to rainfall
inﬁltration, which excludes the long-term (or seasonal) water head
response in the slope as observed by Iverson and Major (1987) in a
landslide area.
2. Reduced-scale model slopes subjected to artiﬁcial rainfalls
Fig. 1(a) shows the artiﬁcial rainfall and the model slope fa-
cilities used in the present study. The artiﬁcial rainfall system
consists of a water tank, an air-compressor, a ﬂowmeter, plastic
pipes, valves, and sprinklers. The uniformity and intensity of
rainfall were carefully calibrated using containers placed in a
regular pattern. Rainfall intensity and uniformity calibrations
showed that for the range of rainfall intensity used in the present
study, coefﬁcients of uniformity Uc ranged between 85% and 91%,
indicating that appropriate uniformity was achieved in the tests. Uc
is deﬁned as:
Uc ¼ 1−

Ii measured rainfall intensity for cup No. i
Im average rainfall intensity for all cups (with a top diameter of
65 mm)
n total number of cups (n=50 in this study)
Fig. 2(a) and (b) schematically shows the geometries of the
reduced-scale model slope. Model slope container was constructed
using 20 mm-thick plywoods with water-proof coating. A rigid base of
the slope is achieved by supporting the lower surface of the base using
wooden beams. The upper side of the base was roughened by gluing
No. 180 sand papers with a mean abrasive grain size of 0.06 mm. A bi-
linear impermeable base consisting of a ﬂat segment near the toe and
an inclined segment with 30° to the horizontal was used in the study.
This bi-linear base is to simulate colluvial deposits frequently found
on hillsides (e.g., Lumb, 1975; Jiao et al., 2005; Gerscovich et al., 2006,
Cascini et al., 2008). A similar bi-linear base condition has been used in
Fig. 3. Particle size distribution curves for the soil used.

ω ¼ WwWs (Ww: weight of pore water, Ws: weight of solids)
γd dry unit weight of soil (=14.2 kN/m3 in the present study)
γw unit weight of water (=9.8 kN/m3)
It can be seen that the error associated with varying the soil unit
weight, ranging between 14 and 15 kN/m3, is small.
3. Mass wasting associated with slope failure
In all the tests to be discussed, the total discharge (including solids
and water) was measured manually using a timer and a series of
measurement buckets placed beneath a funnel adjacent to the toe of
the slope, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The frequency of replacing the
measurement buckets varied between 4 times/min and 0.1 times/min,
depending on the solid discharging rate. The total weight (including
the solid material and water) in every bucket was measured
immediately after the tests, and the solid content of the total
discharge was measured after air and oven drying processes.
Consequently, three signiﬁcant quantities, namely, the solid discharge
rate (qs), the cumulative solid discharge (Qs), and the volumetric
concentration (Cv) at the toe of the model slope were measured.
Fig. 5(a) shows the solid discharge rate, qs vs. time (t) relationships
for the model subjected to various constant rainfall intensities, I, of 23,
47, and 65 mm/h. It can be seen that the mass wasting process can be
characterized by a rapid increase of solid discharge at certain
threshold moments which are rainfall-intensity dependent. Fig. 5(b)
shows that the Cv vs. time (t) relationship is also greatly inﬂuenced by
the rainfall intensity. The increase of I from 23 to 47 mm/h (about
double the rate) results in an increase of the peak of qs from about
8×10−6 m3/s to about 70–80×10−6 m3/s, about a ten-fold increase,
showing that the inﬂuence of rainfall intensity on qs is signiﬁcant and
nonlinear. A comparison of Cv in Fig. 5(b) also indicates a peak value of
Cv 30% for I=23 mm/h, with peak values of Cv 60% and 50% for
I=65 mm/h and 47 mm/h, respectively. The former can be classiﬁed as
hyperconcentrated ﬂow, and the latter as debris ﬂow, as suggested by
Lavigne and Suwa (2004). Fig. 5(c) shows the cumulative solid
discharge, Qs, vs. t relationships for three tests under various rainfall
intensities. The curves for relatively high rainfall intensities (I=65 and
47 mm/h) are characterized by steep slopes, which is not the case for
I=23 mm/h. Because of the time-consuming process of slope failures,
only the case of I=65 mm/h has attained a high discharged volume of
Pv=90%. It is noted, however, approximately linear segments of the Qs
vs. t curves were obtained in all tests for relatively large elapsed times,
it is believed that ultimate values of Pv at a certain time of interest can
be obtained by linearly extrapolating these Qs vs. t curves.
Fig. 6 shows the relationships between the percentage of volumetric
solid discharge, Pv, and cumulative rainfall, Rc, using the same test
results as those shown in Fig. 5(c). Pv is deﬁned as the ratio between the
total volume of solids of the slope and the volume of discharged solids. It
can be seen that the slopes subjected to I=65 and 47mm/h have similar
curves, while the slope for I=23 mm/h is very different. This suggests
that Rc is not solely the function of Pv when the rainfall intensity is less
than a threshold value (e.g., 47 mm/h in this case).
It is worth mentioning that the mechanism controlling the rapid
solid discharges seen in Figs. 5(c) and 6 is the so-called retrogressive
failure (or mass wasting), as shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c). Fig. 7(a) shows a
view of the slope toe failure at t=70minwhich is at the ﬁrst inﬂection
point on the Qs vs. t curve for I=47 mm/h. As shown in Fig. 7(a), a
scrap (or a cliff) can be observed at the upper boundary of the wash-
out area. Fig. 7(b) and (c) was taken at t=80 min and 101 min,

consisting of colluviums underlain by a mudstone stratum. In addition
to the natural slopes described above, retrogressive failures were
observed in laboratory ﬂume tests on ﬂowslides of coal stockpiles
(Eckersley, 1990) and loose sandy and silty soils (Wang and Sassa,
2001, 2003). Retrogressive slope failures were also observed in the
artiﬁcial rainfall tests on large-scale sandy slopes performed by
Iversion et al., (1997). In a study of hazard mitigation, retrogressive
slope failures were used as parts of debris ﬂow scenarios by Crosta
et al. (2006). Therefore, it is believed that the retrogressive failure
observed in the present study is also a dominant failure mode for
natural slopes. However, more studies are required to examine the
general validity of retrogressive failure mechanisms to the rainfall-
induced failure of natural slopes consisting of various geo-materials
and boundary conditions.
4. Soil moisture response to rainfall
Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows typical examples of the responses of the
water content (ω) vs. t curves measured on the left-and right-hand
sides, respectively, at themiddle height of the slope (S=0.9m), under a
constant rainfall intensity of I=65 mm/h. The reason for selecting the
MS at S=0.9 m, rather than those at S=0.46 m and S=1.29 m, as a
typical example is because the MS at S=0.9 m is less inﬂuenced by the
up-stream and/or down-stream boundaries of the model slope. The
MS at S=0.9 m better simulates the in-soil moisture response for a
homogeneous inﬁnite slope. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the following
trends:
(1) The measured values ofω (or Sr) for the moisture sensors at the
left-and right-sections are similar, suggesting that a two-
dimensional (2-D) inﬁltration condition was achieved in this
test.
(2) The curves measured by the MS near the slope surface, namely
M7 (upper-left) and M8 (upper-right), are characterized by a
two-stage rising pattern which is different from the one-stage
rising pattern for the moisture sensors at the base (or soil–base
interface, M5 and M6) of the slope. This is schematically shown
in Fig. 11.
Fig. 9(a) and (b) shows plots similar to those shown in Fig. 8(a) and
(b), respectively, except that Fig. 9(a) and (b) is for S=0.46 m. In
general, the moisture sensors located at the impermeable base (M1
and M2) show a one-step rise to a relatively high degree of saturation.
This is similar to that discussed for Fig. 8(a) and (b) earlier. However,
all the sensors show their maximum values of Sr to be about 80%
rather than 100%, due possibly to the fact that the toe reached the state
of failure (or collapse) at a relatively early stage, changing the soil
density from its initial state. It can also be seen that the two-stage
rising pattern observed in Fig. 8(a) and (b) is also valid in this case.
Fig. 10(a) and (b) shows similar plots for MS at S=1.29 m. The response
of the MS at the impermeable base shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b) is still
valid in this case, while the maximum values of Sr for the MS found at
the middle depth of the slope are only 60%–70% of those for M9 and
M10 at the base. This shows that a rise in the water table at the upper
part of the slope is unlikely to occur due probably to the interﬂow
towards the toe of the slope dominated by the gravitational force.
Based on the similar responses for the sensors on both the left- and
the right-hand, as shown in Figs. 8(a)–10(b), the rainfall-induced
inﬁltration in the slope may be thought of as occurring in a two-
dimensional (2-D) manner. It is also noted that some signiﬁcant
moments regarding the slope failure, such as the 0.5% of total solid
volume discharge (or the inﬂect point of the Qs vs. t curve), and the 5%

for the moisture sensors on the left-and right-hand sides are
approximately equal. The smaller threshold times (or the ones noted
earlier) between the left-and right-hand sides will be used later. In
general, the curve for the MS found at the soil–base interface is
characterized by one inﬂection point and a peak; whereas the one for

142 C.-C. Huang et al. / Engineering Geology 101 (2008) 134–145
noted that Tmp (up) is an indicator for a relatively large degree of solid
discharge (more than 30% of total volume of the slope). However, this
observation is valid only for some locations (S=0.9 m and S=1.29 m)
under speciﬁc rainfall intensities, I=23mm/h and 47mm/h. The above
observation, that Tmp (up) represents a relatively large degree of solid
discharge, has two exceptions (see ‘×3’ for I=65mm/h in Fig. 14(a) and
‘×3’ for I=65 mm/h in Fig. 14b). The reversed sequence of ‘×2’ (Tmp (base))
and ‘×3’ (Tmp (up)) occurred only in the case of a high rainfall intensity of
I=65mm/h, suggesting that perchedwater associatedwith downward
wetting may prevail in the case of high rainfall intensities.
Fig. 15(a) shows values of water contents measured at the left
section of 0.2 m-below-surface for key moments (the beginning of
rainfall, the inﬂection point of the Qs vs. t curve, and Qs equal to 5% of
the total solid volume), for the slope subjected to a rainfall intensity of
23 mm/h. The value of ω (or Sr) along the full length of the 0.2 m-
below-surface zone generally increases as the extent of retrogressive
slope failure increases. The only exception is the value of ω (or Sr) for
Pv=5% and S=0.46 m. The decrease of ω (or Sr) at this point is
attributable to the collapse of the slope near the toe. Fig. 15(b) and (c)
shows similar results as those shown in Fig.15(a), except that Fig.15(b)
and (c) is for the cases of I=47 and 65 mm/h, respectively. Similar
patterns of ω vs. S relationships for Pv=5% can be found in all cases
examined, indicating that relatively high values of Sr (=60–80%) exist
in the near-toe and the mid-height zones (S=0.46 m and 0.9 m) and
relatively low values of Sr (=40%–50%) exist in the far-from-the-toe
zone (S=1.29 m). For relatively large rainfall intensities of I=47 and
65 mm/h, relatively uniform distributions of Sr in the 0.2 m-below-
surface zone at the inﬂection point, compared with that for the low
intensity of I=23 mm/h, can be detected.
Fig. 16(a)–(c) shows similar results as those shown in Fig. 15(a)–(c),
except that the data shown in Fig. 16(a)–(c) was measured at the left
section of the soil–bedrock interface. Fig. 16(a) shows that at the
inﬂection point and Pv=5%, a high Sr state is obtained at S=0.46 m.
The value of Sr decreased to some extent for S=0.9 and 1.29 m.
However, a reverse tendency on the values of ω (or Sr) along the soil–
bedrock interface for relatively larger rainfall intensities (I=47 and
65 mm/h) of that for a low rainfall intensity can be seen in Fig. 16(b)
and (c), indicating a higher potential of interﬂow along the soil–
bedrock interface in the cases of higher rainfall intensities, such as 47
and 65 mm/h. Fig. 16(b) and (c) also reveals relatively uniform water
content distributions at these two critical failure states, compared
with that shown in Fig. 16(a), also indicating a possible effect of the
interﬂow outﬂow along the soil–bedrock interface as stated above.
Similar effects of lateral interﬂow to the pore pressure build-up and
slope to instability has also been pointed out by Zhang et al. (2000) in
a ﬁeld rainfall inﬁltration tests on a natural slope with a shallow
impermeable geological joint. It is noted that the geometry of the
slope and the presence of a ﬂat bottom of the model at its base, may
inﬂuence the process of saturation and seepage pattern of the slope.
The effect of impermeable base conﬁguration to the internal moisture
and seepage response should be investigated in the future.
6. Conclusions
Three constant-intensity rainfall tests were performed on 0.32 m-
deep, 0.7 m-high, 1.77 m-long, and 1.5 m-wide slopes consisting of a
homogeneous sandy soil (SM) with a dry unit weight of 14.2 kN/m3 and
a slope angle of 30°. The slopes rested on a rigid impermeable base
consisting of a ﬂat segment near the toe and a segment inclined at 30°
to the horizontal for upper part of the slope. The focus of the study was
the responses of interior soil moisture and the solid discharge due to
rainfall-induced slope failure. The following conclusions can be drawn:
1. For uniform sand slopes examined in the present study, rainfall-
induced retrogressive slope failures are characterized by solid
discharge curves with clear inﬂection points showing the start of
abrupt solid wasting. The discharges have a high solid content with
volumetric solid concentrations of up to about 60%, resulted from
the wash-out of the retrogressively slumped soil mass by the
interﬂow along the soil–bedrock interface. Therefore, these
discharge curves may represent events of slope-failure-induced
debris ﬂows, which are distinct from those induced by slope
surface erosion and/or piping.
2. A similar sequence of the solid discharge responding to the rainfall
was observed in all tests using various rainfall intensities: (I) minor
wash-out of the slope toe, (II) start of retrogressive slope failure
triggered by toe failure, and (III) abrupt increase of discharged
solids and/or solid concentration due to the wash-out of the slope
debris carried by the interﬂow along the impermeable base.
3. Interior moisture response to the rainfall consists of three major
phases: (I) formation of a downward wet front which causes an
increase in the degrees of saturation from the initial state to about
50%–70%, (II) transition from a downward wet front to an upward
saturation front (orwater table) at the impermeable base of the slope,
and (III) a rise of the saturation front (or groundwater table) towards
the slope surface, accompanied by interﬂow along the soil–bedrock
interface and ﬂuidizations of the slope toe. This observation holds
true regardless of the intensity of the rainfall tested in the present
study and is consistent with those reported in some earlier studies.
4. The arrival time of the wet front at the soil–bedrock interface of
the slope (Tm1 (base)) provides an early indicator for the onset of
solid discharge, deﬁned by the inﬂection point of the Qs vs. t
curve at which 0.5%bQsb1. 2% of total volume of solid is wasted.
The time of peak moisture content at the soil–bedrock interface
of the slope (Tmp (base)) consistently estimates small extents of
solid discharge (b10% of total volume) resulting from rainfall-
induced slope failures. This conclusion holds true regardless of
the location of moisture measurements and rainfall intensity.
The time of peak moisture content at a depth of 0.2 m from the
slope surface ‘Tmp (up)’ shows that the arrival of the upward water
table (or saturation front) is an indicator of a relatively large
degree of solid discharge, namely, more than 30% volumetric
solid discharge of the slope.
5. Two critical failure states of the slope, namely, the ﬁrst inﬂection
point and a 5% of total solid discharge on the Qs vs. t curve, were
accompanied by nonuniform water content distributions within
the slope, showing: (1) higher water contents for the soil–bedrock
interface than those for the 0.2 m-below-surface zone and (2) more
uniform distributions along the dip of the slope when subjected to
a more intensive rainfall. For the 0.2 m-below-surface zone, a fully
saturated state of Sr=100% is never attained at the moment of ﬁrst
inﬂection point and 5% solid volume discharge on the Qs vs. t
curves, regardless of the intensities of rainfall. The nonuniform
water content along the depth and the dip of the slope at two
critical failure states suggests the possibility of an interﬂow along
the soil–bedrock interface and its inﬂuence on toe failure and the
subsequent debris discharge. This requires further experimental
and analytical studies in the future.
It is noted that the internalmoisture response, interﬂowand seepage
patterns may be inﬂuenced by slope and bedrock conﬁgurations. More
studies are required to validate the present conclusions for various slope
conﬁgurations and boundary conditions. In addition to rainfall tests on
the model slopes using various geometries and boundary conditions,
tests on hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture characteristic curve for
the soil used here, and seepage and slope stability analyses are
undergoing. The result is to be reported in the near future.

Better knowledge regarding internal soil moisture and piezometric responses in the process of rainfall-
induced shallow slope failures is the key to an effective prediction of the landslide and/or debris ﬂow
initiation. To this end, internal soil moisture and piezometric response of 0.7-m-deep, 1.5-m-wide, 1.7-
m-high, and 3.94-m-long semi-inﬁnite sandy slopes rested on a bi-linear impermeable bedrock were
explored using a chute test facility with artiﬁcial rainfall applications. The internal response time deﬁned
by the inﬂection point of the soil moisture and piezometric response curves obtained along the soil–bed-
rock interface were closely related to some critical failure states, such as the slope toe failure and exten-
sive slope failures. It was also found that the response times obtained at the point of abrupt bedrock slope
decrease can be used as indicators for the initiation of rainfall-induced shallow slope failures. An
investigation of spatial distributions of soil water content, x (or degrees of saturation, Sr), in the slope
at critical failure states shows that the 0.2 m – below – surface zone remains unsaturated with Sr ;
40–60%, regardless of their distances from the toe and the rainfall intensity. Non-uniform distributions
of x (or Sr) along the soil–bedrock interface at critical failure states were always associated with near-
saturation states (Sr ; 80–100%) around the point of bedrock slope change or around the transient
‘toe’ upstream of the slumped mass induced by the retrogressive failure of the slope. These observations
suggest the important role of the interﬂow along the soil–bedrock interface and the high soil water con-
tent (or high porewater pressure) around the point of bedrock slope deﬂection in the rainfall-induced
failure of sandy slopes consisting of shallow impermeable bedrocks. The present study proposes an ‘inter-
nal response time’ criterion to substantiate the prediction of rainfall-induced shallow slope failures. It is
believed that the ‘internal response time’ reﬂects the overall characteristics of a slope under rainfall inﬁl-
tration and can be as useful as the conventional meteorology-based threshold times. The ‘internal
response time’ theory can be generalized via numerical modeling of slope hydrology, slope geology
and slope stability in the future.

Introduction
In areas of heavy precipitation, rainfall-induced slope failures
are often the major source of devastating debris (or mud) ﬂows
(Lumb, 1975; Anderson and Sitar, 1995; Iverson et al., 1997; Dai
et al., 1999; Okura et al., 2002; Cheng et al., 2005; Gabet and Mudd,
2006). Mechanisms of slope failure have been extensively studied
using model tests, numerical analyses and in-situ large scale tests
in the past. Reduced-scale model tests have revealed some valu-
able information regarding the mechanism of rainfall-induced
slope failures. Nishigaki et al. (1999) performed a series of rainfall
tests on 1.0-m-high, 1.5-m-wide and 1.5-m-long sandy slopes and
observed a two-phase increase in the soil moisture content associ-
ated with retrogressive failures induced by the rainfall inﬁltration.
They attributed this two-phase (or two-step) moisture response to
the downward progress of the wetting front and upward progress
of the groundwater level induced by the rainfall inﬁltration. They
concluded that the in-soil moisture measurement outperforms
the conventional porewater pressure measurement in predicting
the slope failure initiation and suggested that the starting time of
the second-phase soil moisture content increase should be used
as an early indicator of slope failure. The two-phase moisture re-
sponse associated with wetting front and groundwater table pro-
gresses has also been conﬁrmed in rainfall simulation tests on
well-monitored sand slopes performed by Orense et al. (2004)
and Huang et al. (2008). They found that the saturation near the
toe and the resulting unstable zone accounts for the start of the
retrogressive slope failure. These ﬁndings are also supported by

on the uniﬁed soil classiﬁcation system (USCS) proposed by the
American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM D 2487). The par-
ticle distribution curve for the soil is shown in Fig. 2. 100-mm-
thick lift and a light vibratory compactor were used to construct
the slope with a target moisture unit weight (cm) of 16–17 kN/
m3 (see Fig. 1), corresponding to dry unit weight (cd) of 14.5–
16.2 kN/m3, void ratios (e) of 0.6–0.78, and relative degrees of com-
paction of 73–81% based on a standard laboratory compaction pro-
cedure (ASTM D 698). The initial value of water content of the soil
(x = weight of water/weight of solids) was between 5% and 10%,
equivalent to a degree of saturation (Sr) between 17% and 44%. Figs.
3a, 3b and 3c show the rainfall simulator, the base of ﬂume and the
soil slope at completion, respectively. Internal friction angles ob-
tained using direct shear tests on saturated soil samples with
cd = 14 and 16 kN/m3 under a conﬁning pressure of 10 kN/m2 were
36 and 40, respectively. Friction angles of 29 and 32 were ob-
tained for soil–sandpaper (No. 150) interface based on direct shear
tests using saturated soil samples with cd = 14 kN/m3 and 16 kN/
m3, respectively. The saturated hydraulic conductivity for the sand
used here, based on a standard test method (ASTM D 2434) for sat-
urated soil samples, were ks = 8  105 m/s and 1  105 m/s for
cd = 14 and 16 kN/m3, respectively. Inﬁltration tests using a 0.5 m
cubic calibration box under constant water heads of 10 mm and
50 mm were also performed with soil moisture and piezometric
measurements, in conjunction with a ﬁnite element program
(SEEP/W, Krahn, 2004) to calibrate the parameters for the soil–
water characteristic curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conduc-
tivity based on the observed inﬁltration behavior (to be reported
elsewhere).

the locations of moisture sensors used in this study. Moisture sen-
sor Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10 (namely, M1, M2, M5, M6, M9, and

following equation:

wherex: water content of soils, e: void ratio of soils (e = eo = 0.72 is
used in the present study, eo is the void ratio of the slope before the
rainfall test) Fig. 5b shows the output voltage vs. x relationships
based on Eqs. (1) and (2) for cd = 14.5 and 16.2 kN/m3, which cover
possible variations of cd in the compacted test slopes. For a speciﬁc
output, the possible error in the values of x associated with the
uncertainty of the initial dry unit weight of soils cd (=14.5–
16.2 kN/m3) was about 14% of the converted values of x.
Six piezometers (Tokyo Sokki Instruments, KPC-200KPA) were
installed in three stainless steel boxes ﬁtted in three trenches along
the bedrock surface. These piezometers have resolutions of about
0.1 kN/m2 which is equivalent to 10 mm of water head. Linear rela-
tionships between the output voltage and the water head were ob-
tained using a 2-m-high calibration standpipe. A data logging
system consisting of a 16-bit A/D converter and a personal com-
puter was used to record the output of piezometers.
Soil moisture and pore pressure responses to rainfall
Figs. 6a–6c show the moisture response for theMS at S = 0.95 m,
1.7 m, and 2.6 m, respectively. These ﬁgures show that soil water
content response curves are characterized by abrupt rising

pattern of soil moisture response curve as shown by M 7 (1.7,0.5)
and M 11 (2.6,0.5) in Figs. 6b and 6c, respectively. The two-phase
increase pattern is true for the sensors at Z = 0.5 m in the case of
a relatively small rainfall intensity of I = 35 mm/h; it is partially
true in the case of I = 70 mm/h; it is not true in the case of
I = 105 mm/h. This may suggest that in the case of a high rainfall
intensity, a high water content (or a high degree of saturation) pre-
vails in the zone behind the wetting front. In contrast to the above,
a lower degree of saturation dominates the zone behind the wet-
ting front in the case of a low rainfall intensity.
It is conceivable that the ﬁrst inﬂection point based on soil
moisture response (Tm1 and Tm1ðsoilÞ) signifying the arrival of down-
ward wetting front is a function of soil hydraulic conductivity and
rainfall intensity; it is not a function of the depth and conﬁguration
of the impermeable layer. However, the response times Tmp and
Twp can be inﬂuenced by the depth and/or conﬁguration of the
impermeable base. Further experiments and numerical studies
on the effects of depth and slope of the impermeable layer to the
‘response times’ must be performed to validate the above hypoth-
esis. Note that spatial distributions of the response times based on
porewater pressure measurements (namely, Tw1 and Twp as deﬁned
in Fig. 8b) curves are similar to ‘Tm1 ’ and ‘Tmp ’ as shown in Fig. 9.
Therefore, the spatial distribution of Tw1 and Twp is not shown here.
Process of retrogressive slope failures
Figs. 10a–10d show some critical moments of retrogressive fail-
ures of the slope subjected to a rainfall intensity I = 70 mm/h.
Fig. 10a is the slope immediately before the rainfall test. Fig. 10b
shows that the toe of the slope is slightly washed away by the
seepage at the toe of the slope. This condition is called ‘minor
toe wash-out’ at which only a very small amount of slope mass

Different scenarios from that described in Fig. 12a can be found in
the cases of I = 70 and 105 mm/h, as shown in Figs. 12b and 12c,
respectively. In these cases, relatively uniform distributions of Sr
(or x) along the slope (S = 0.95–2.6 m) can be seen, except when
the scarp was at S = 0.95 m for I = 105 mm/h (see Fig. 12c) due to
the extensive collapsing around trench No. 1 (S = 0.95 m). Figs.
13a–13c show similar information to that shown in Figs. 12a–
12c, except that Figs. 13a–13c are for the data measured at the
soil–bedrock interface. Despite the different rainfall intensities,
these ﬁgures show similar patterns of x (or Sr) vs. S curves at
the moment of toe failure, which show extremely non-uniform dis-
tributions of Sr (or x) characterized by a near-saturation state at
the near-toe zone, beginning from the state of toe failure to the
state of a scarp developed at trench No. 1 (S = 0.95 m). Further-
more, signiﬁcant increases in x (or Sr) at S = 1.7 m between the
state of toe failure and the state of a scarp at S = 0.95 m suggest
that retrogressive slope failure is associated with a near-saturated
condition around the transient ‘toe’ which developed upstream of
the slumpedmass. Higher values ofx along the soil–bedrock inter-
face than those at 0.2 m – below – surface at critical failure states
of the slope and the near-saturated condition at the transient ‘toe’
associated with the retrogressive failure suggest a possible effect of
the interﬂow along the soil–bedrock interface on the retrogressive
failure of the slope.
Fig. 14a shows porewater pressure distributions along the soil–
bedrock interface at two critical moments of slope failure, namely,
toe failure and a slump with a scarp at S = 0.95 m. Negative pore
pressures prevail even when the failure proceeds to some extent.
Comparing Figs. 14a and 13a, the soil moisture response may be

caused by slope failures (Keefer et al., 1987; Crosta, 1998; Aleotti,
2004). These ‘rainfall thresholds’ criteria are often region-speciﬁc
and are subject to high uncertainties (Caine, 1980; Cancelli and
Nova, 1985; Cannon and Ellen, 1985). The response time based
on internal moisture and piezometric measurements (called ‘inter-
nal response time criteria’ here) may increase the accuracy of
hydrology-based predictions of shallow slope failures (and/or deb-
ris ﬂow initiation). The current work explores the internal response
time criterion based on spatial variations of response times (Fig. 9),
soil moisture (Figs. 12a–13c), and piezometric head (Figs. 14a–14c)
to identify the locus of internal soil moisture and pore pressure
measurements. The results suggest that the point of bedrock
deﬂection (namely, S;0.95 m in the present study) where high soil
water content and/or porewater pressure tend to occur due to a
change of subsurface direction and the slowdown of the seepage
ﬂow velocity, can serve as the locus of soil moisture and porewater
pressure measurements to capture critical failure states of the
slope.
This work also offers a means of identifying the representative
time for the onset of retrogressive slope failures using ‘response
time’ analyses. Results of the analyses suggest that the response
times (Tm1 and Tw1 ), which represent the arrival of a downward
wetting front at the soil–bedrock interface, may serve as a precur-
sor for the onset of slope failure (namely, a failure state between a
minor toe wash-out and a toe failure). Fig. 15a and b show typical
examples of response times obtained at S = 0.95 m of the soil–bed-
rock interface as a function of rainfall intensity. To show the rela-
tionship between the response times and the extent of
retrogressive failures, critical times for various degrees of failures
(such as: the toe failure, a scarp at S = 0.95 m, and a scarp at
S = 1.7 m) are also presented as a function of rainfall intensity.
Fig. 15a shows the case of response times based on soil moisture
measurements. It is clear that the time of ﬁrst inﬂection point on
the soil moisture curve or the time of a wetting front arriving at
the bedrock (Tm1 , denoted by ‘1’) consistently serve as an early
indicator (or precursor) for minor toe wash-out; the time of peak
soil moisture (Tmp denoted by ‘2’) accurately simulates the time
of slope toe failure at which Pv ; 0:5%. This observation is inde-
pendent of the rainfall intensity, as shown in Fig. 15a. Fig. 15b
shows a similar plot to that shown in Fig. 15a, except that this ﬁg-
ure is for the response time based on porewater pressure measure-
ments. In this ﬁgure, ‘1’ denotes the time of the ﬁrst inﬂection
point on the porewater pressure vs. time curve, namely, Tw1 , and
‘2’ denotes the time of peak porewater pressure, namely, Twp ,
on the porewater pressure vs. time curve. It can be seen that Tw1
approximates a critical moment between the minor toe wash-out
and the toe failure; Twp simulates various degrees of slope failure
between a toe failure and a proceeded slope failure with
Pv > 35%. Findings from Figs. 15a and 15b suggest that both soil-
moisture-based and porewater-pressure-based internal response
times, Tm1 and Tw1 , obtained at the locus of the bedrock slope tran-
sition (S = 0.95 m in this study) are effective as indicators for the
toe failure (or the initiation of shallow slope failures with a small
value of Pv ; 0.05%). The response time ‘Tmp ’, which represents
the time of the peak soil moisture (or saturated) condition, accu-
rately simulates the time of toe failure. However, this is not true
for the case of ‘Twp ’. It is noted that the rainfall intensity (I) vs. time

Wu and Sidle (1995), Gorsevski et al. (2006), Meisina and Scarabelli
(2007), and Deb and El-Kadi (2009). Thesemodels rendered generally
good spatial and temporal indications of slopes with high potential of
failures. However, the applicability of these models in better
predicting the initiation of fast-moving mass ﬂow using meteorolog-
ical data is yet to be examined.
There have also been some experimental and analytical studies on
the mechanism of rainfall-induced slope failures (e.g., Okimura and
Ichikawa, 1985; Iseda and Tanabashi, 1986; Collins and Znidarcic,
2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Hϕydal, and Heyerdahl, 2006). These studies
revealed a close interdependency between wetting front propagation
and slope instability. However, the deﬁnition of ‘slope failure’ in the
above studies was not always clear, because a quantitative indicator of
the failure such as the volume of debris discharge was unknown.
Relating the initiation of fast-moving mass ﬂows to a quantitative
indicator of the potential failure mass is essential for minimizing the
uncertainties of empirical ‘rainfall thresholds’ (e.g., Caine, 1980;
Cannon and Ellen, 1985; Keefer et al., 1987; Jan and Lee, 2004; Aleotti,
2004). Studies relating internal soil moisture or piezometric
responses to external responses (i.e., the rate of debris discharge
from retrogressive slope failures) are very limited. Huang et al. (2008,
2009), however, proposed a prototype of ‘internal soil moisture and
porewater pressure response envelope’ under a commonly adopted
rainfall intensity (I) vs. duration (D) framework, based on artiﬁcial
rainfall tests on both reduced-scale and large-scale sand slopes. Their
results highlighted some fundamental elements for a generic model
describing the internal and external processes of shallow slope
failures, including the key roles of interﬂow along the soil-bedrock
interface, and the mounding of porewater pressure adjacent to the
transition point for slope failures. However, there were deﬁciencies of
the test set-up in their studies such as the lack of direct measurement
of debris discharge and that of piezometric measurement. To obtain a
more complete slope failure scenario, we performed artiﬁcial rainfall
tests with intensive soil moisture, piezometric, and debris discharge
measurements using a new model slope (Fig. 1). The properties of
slopematerial and the rainfall simulator used are similar to those used
by Huang et al. (2008, 2009). The thickness of slope material is 1.5
times that used by Huang et al. (2008) to investigate its inﬂuence on
the process of slope failures.
2. Laboratory test set-up
A 2.29 m long, 0.84 m high, and 0.645 m wide wooden soil bin
made of side and bottom plywood plates of 20 mm thickwith awater-
proof coating was ﬁxed on a wooden stand (Fig. 1). The bin had a
debris discharge collection funnel immediately below the slope toe.
The debris collection bucket beneath the funnel was replaced during
the artiﬁcial rainfall test at variable rates of 1–3 min per bucket,
depending on the discharging rate during the test. A total of 100–150
buckets were weighed and subsequently dried to measure the
weights of both discharged solids and water. The soil bin had a 30°-
inclined impermeable base and a near-ﬂat one adjacent to the slope
toe (Fig. 2). The model slope consists of a 0.48-m-deep sand stratum
at the central part, a ﬂat crest at its top, and a nearly ﬂat base near the
slope toe (Fig. 2b), which is a scaled-up version of the sandy model
slope with a 0.32-m-deep slope mass at the center used by Huang et
al. (2008). Model slopes with similar conﬁgurations have been used to
simulate alluvial or man-made ﬁll on hillsides; they frequently have a
ﬂat base near the toe as a self-stabilizing mechanism (e.g., Lumb,
1975; Jiao et al., 2005; Gerscovich et al., 2006; Cascini et al., 2008).
Similar slope conﬁgurations were used in laboratory model tests by
Okura et al. (2002) and Orense et al. (2004). With the aid of this self-
stabilizing mechanism, a man-made stabilizing structure such as the
soil retaining wall used in a large-scale model test by Iverson et al.
(1997) can be eliminated, and test slope conﬁgurations similar to
those of alluvium on hillsides can be achieved. Sand paper No. 150
with amean particle size of 0.06 mmwas attached to the inner surface
of the slope to form a rough base condition.
Sandy slopes were constructed by lightly compacting a speciﬁc
weight of silty sand with a water content (ωs) of 10% down into 20-
mm-thick horizontal layers using a 0.45 N rubber hammer. This
process was repeated until a 0.84-m-high sandy slope was obtained.
The prepared sandy slopes had a dry density (γd) of 16.0 kN m−3, or a
void ratio (e) of 0.70. Direct shear tests performed under low
conﬁning pressures, between 10 and 20 kN m−2, showed that a
Mohr–Coulomb failure envelope with a cohesion intercept c=0 and
internal friction angle ϕ=41.7° are applicable to the saturated
condition of e=0.70 and ωs=26%. The hydraulic conductivity (ks)
of saturated soil specimens with e=0.7 based on a standard constant
head test (ASTMD 2434) was 2×10−5 m s−1. The silty sand used here
is identical to those used by Huang et al. (2008, 2009). Silty sands
were frequently found as matrix material of colluviums on hillslopes
(Buchanan and Savigny, 1990; Yoshida et al., 1991; Matsushi, et al.,
2006; Gerscovich et al., 2006; Lacerda, 2007; Coe et al., 2008). Silty
sands have also been used as slope material in the model study of
rainfall-induced shallow failures (Okura et al., 2002; Wang and Sassa,
2003; Orense et al., 2004; Sako et al., 2006; Lourenco et al., 2006). The
present study focuses on the behavior of sandy slopes subjected to
rainfall inﬁltration. Failure mechanisms of slopes consisting of other
types of soils, such as gravels and clays, must be investigated in the
future.
Soil moisture sensors and piezometers were installed along the
central line of the slope during the construction of the slope. The
sensors were located along the central section of the slope, not along
multiple sections, based on the observation by Huang et al. (2008)
that the internal soil moisture responded to rainfall in a two-
dimensional manner. Locations of the moisture sensors along the
central line of the slope are denoted asM1–M11 in Fig. 2. Themoisture
sensors (Decagon, ECH2O) were 100 mm long, 10 mm wide, and
1 mm thick. The results of the calibration of the moisture sensors

that at the time of the transition point of the Qs vs. t curve
(tin=103.3 min.), a clear sign of the slope toe wash-out occurs.
Retrogressive failure of the slope can be seen in Fig. 5b, c for Pv=0.5%,
and 5%, respectively. These ﬁgures all indicate that the retrogressive
failure occurred with an uppermost scarp approximately parallel to
the line of the slope toe; i.e., the slope failed in an approximate two-
dimensional manner, conﬁrming the results of Huang et al. (2008,
2009). Fig. 6 shows developments of retrogressive failure surfaces at
various critical times for the slopes subjected to I=47 mm h−1, based
on the images recorded by digital cameras. Similar retrogressive
failures as those shown in Fig. 6 have also been reported by Bjerrum
(1967), for overly-consolidated natural clay slopes; Skempton and
Hutchinson (1969) for natural slopes consisting of colluviums
underlain by mudrocks; and Eckersley (1990) as well as Wang and
Sassa (2001, 2003) in laboratory ﬂowslide tests using sandy soils as
test median.
4. Internal moisture response in relation to retrogressive
slope failures
Fig. 7 shows contours for the degree of saturation (Sr) at two
critical moments for the slope subjected to I=47 mm h−1. The
degree of saturation Sr≥90% is referred to as a ‘fully saturated
condition’. This is based on the results of calibration box tests, which
show that due to the air trapped in the voids, a ground water table
develops in the zone of Sr≥90%. The existence of a groundwater table
is usually deemed to be the result of a fully saturated state (Sr=100%)
in conventional geotechnical engineering practice. It can also be seen
that the lines of Sr≥90% ﬁrst developed around the transition point of
bedrock slopes (Fig. 7a) and then spread out into the zone of the slope
toe (Fig. 7b), causing a noticeable slope toe failure.
Fig. 8 shows typical time series measurements of soil moisture
response at 0.55, 0.90, 1.29, and 1.73 m from the slope toe measured
in the case of I=47 mm h−1. It can be seen that the soil moisture
represented by ω or Sr is characterized by a ﬂat segment from t=0 to
a certain time, followed by an abrupt increase in the curve to a near-
saturated (or saturated) state. The point of transition from a ﬂat
segment into a steep one can be considered as the arrival time of the
‘wetting front’, which is called ‘Tml’ hereafter. Fig. 8b,c shows that
values of Tm1 increase as the depth of the moisture sensor increases,
reﬂecting the time lag required for the downward propagation of the
wetting front from the slope surface. Fig. 8b, c also shows that the
curves for M4 (0.9, 0) and M7 (1.29, 0) have relatively large values of
Tm1 compared with those for other moisture sensors at the same
distance from the toe. However, they always reach the peak of ω (or
Sr) in a very short period of time, suggesting that, once the wetting
front reaches the impermeable base, a groundwater table (or an
interﬂow along the saturated soil–bedrock interface) develops
immediately. Fig. 8d shows the time series responses for M10 (1.73,
0) and M11 (1.73, 0.16). It can be seen that they have relatively small
values of Tm1 compared to those shown in Fig. 8a, reﬂecting the effect
of relatively thin soil cover at the crest of the slope (see Fig. 2).
5. Porewater pressure response in relation to retrogressive
slope failures
Fig. 9 shows porewater pressure heads (hp) measured at the soil-
base interface at various critical moments: tin=103.3 min for
Pv=0.5%; t=133 min for Pv=5% (or t5%=133 min); t=154 min
for Pv=10% (or t10%=154 min); and t=200.5 min for Pv=20% (or
t20%=201 min). Note that the piezometric head reaches a maximum
of hp=228 mm at P2 (0.9, 0) and a maximum of hp=120 mm at P1
(0.55, 0) at=133.1 min, when a moderate solid discharge occurred
(Pv=5%). The values of hp decrease as the extent of slope failure
increases, suggesting that the slope toe failure changed the slope toe
conﬁguration and thus the pattern of subsurface ﬂow. At Pv=20%, the
value of hp for P3 (1.29, 0), which is at a relatively upstream location,
ﬁnally reaches its maximum in the response history. It is noted that
patterns of pressure heads along the soil-bedrock interface reach a
relatively steady state since the moment of t5%, indicating that the
constant rate of debris discharge as shown in Fig. 4b is associated with
a relatively steady porewater pressure distribution. Fig. 10 shows the
time series response of porewater pressures for P1 (0.55, 0), P2 (0.9,
0), and P3 (1.29, 0). It can be seen that the three curves are all
characterized by a rapidly increasing segment with a starting point at
t≤ tin (the time of Pv=0.5%) and a peak approximately between t5%
and t20% (the times of Pv=5% and 20%, respectively), indicating inter-
dependency of the internal piezometric and the external responses to
rainfall.
6. Response times at the soil-bedrock interface
Fig. 11 shows the deﬁnition of critical response time for
piezometric and soil moisture measurements as shown in Figs. 8
and 10. Tm1 (or Tw1) denotes the time of the ﬁrst transition point on
theω vs. t curve (or hp vs. t curve); Tmp(or Twp) denotes the time of the
peak value of ω (or hp) on the ω vs. t (or hp vs. t) curve. Fig. 12 shows
the relationship between various critical times of the slope (tin, t5%,
Fig. 4. Retrogressive slope failures observed in the tests. (a) Distance of the scarp, S vs.
time; (b) Percentage of discharged solid volume, Pv vs. time.

smaller size than that used here. It can also be seen that the response
time (×4) always occurs slightly before tin, indicating the potential of
using Tmp obtained at M4 (0.9, 0) (represented by ‘×4’) and Tm1
(represented by ‘×3’) obtained at that point as accurate and
conservative indicators, respectively, for the onset of slope failure.
Fig. 13 shows a plot similar to that in Fig. 12, except that it uses the
response time based on the porewater pressure measured at P2 (0.9,
0), namely, Tw1 (denoted by ‘×1’) and Twp (denoted by ‘×2’). It can be
seen that the response time (Tw1) obtained from the porewater
pressure vs. time curve at P2 (0.9, 0) located near to the transition
point of the bedrock slope simulates the time of the onset of slope
failure (or the onset of abrupt debris discharge). However, the
response time, Twp, represents the time when the slope failure
proceeds to some of Pv∼5% for the case of I=65 and 47 mm h−1 and
Pv∼7% for the case of I=23 mm h−1. Therefore, Twp is considered
unconservative as an indicator for the onset of an abrupt debris
discharge induced by a slope failure.
7. Conceptual model of shallow slope failures
The proposed conceptual model for the internal and external
responses of model sandy slopes subjected to rainfall is shown in
Fig. 14. Arrows with dotted lines signify the wetting front propagation
in the unsaturated ﬂow ﬁeld; arrows with solid lines signify the
saturated interﬂow propagation and the phreatic table development.
The symbols ➀, ➁, ➂, ➃, and ➄ represent the beginning of rainfall
inﬁltration, the arrival of wetting front at the impermeable bedrock-
soil interface, the propagation of interﬂow along the saturated soil-
bedrock interface, the arrival of interﬂow at the point of bedrock slope
transition, and the critical height of the water table, respectively. ➁
can be simulated by Tm1 obtained along the soil-bedrock interface; ➂
and ➃ can be simulated by Tmp and/or Tw1 obtained along the soil-
bedrock interface. It is conceivable that ➁˜➂˜➃, because once the
wetting front reaches the bedrock, the interﬂow propagates down-
ward with a high ﬂow velocity in the saturated ﬁeld. Furthermore, at

➃, the saturated ﬂow along the bedrock ﬁeld is connected to the slope
surface inﬁltration; the inﬁltrated water arrives at the toe in a short
period of time due to a relatively high permeability of the saturated
soil-bedrock interface. A similar observation was made by Torres et al.
(1998) on the unsaturated ﬂow ﬁeld of a natural slope induced by
artiﬁcial rainfall. They found a rapid response of porewater pressure in
the slope subjected to a spike increase of rainfall when the
unsaturated zone, the saturated zone and the discharge were linked.
This is the case in the present study, in that a constant rate of debris
(water+solid) discharge occurs when the saturated interﬂow is
linked to the slope surface inﬁltration. The link of the slope toe zone to
the surface inﬁltration results in an increased soil–bedrock interﬂow
rate and a signiﬁcant mounding of the water table or ﬂooding,
partially due to the slowdown of ﬂow velocity around the point of
bedrock slope reduction. ➄ represents a relatively steady phreatic
table condition valid for the condition of Pv≥5% as shown in Fig. 9.
From the test results shown in Figs. 12 and 13 and those reported by
Huang et al. (2008, 2009), the critical moments of slope failure (tin)
are consistently close to ➂ and ➃, represented by Tmp or Tw1 obtained
along the soil–bedrock interface. Therefore, Tmp or Tw1 along the
interface can be an accurate predictor of slope failure, and Tm1 along
the interface can be a conservative precursor for the onset of shallow
slope failure (tin). The proposed conceptual model is also valid in the
case of natural slopes consisting of weathered granite and volcanic
rocks as reported by Jiao et al. (2005) who found a chair-shaped
saturated zone called the high hydraulic conductivity zone between
the topsoil and the bedrock. This zone has high water pressure which
causes low slope stability in response to rainfall. The chair-shaped

obtained for various values of I form an envelope that approximately
agrees with the envelope of I vs. tin. Lines of I vs. Twp all fall to the right
of the envelope of I vs. tin. The line of I vs. Twp (1.29, 0) falls to the right
of t5%, suggesting that a signiﬁcant delay may occur when using the
envelope of I vs. Twp as a precursor of slope failure initiation. The
observations obtained from Fig. 16a,b regarding the envelopes of Tm1
and Tmp are also applicable to the reduced-scale slopes with a similar
sand and slope geometry, reported by Huang et al. (2008) as shown in
Fig. 17. In Fig. 17a,b, all values of Tm1 and Tmp obtained along the soil–
bedrock interface fall to the left of the envelopes of tin and t5%,
respectively. Fig. 18 show internal and external response envelopes
similar to those in Fig. 16, except that the former is based on the large-
scale model tests by Huang et al. (2009). Note that in the case of large-
scale tests, tin is deﬁned as the ﬁrst transition point of the S vs. t curves
(similar to those shown in Fig. 4a) because Huang et al. (2009) did not
directlymeasure debris discharge. At themoment of tin, Pv is 5%, based
on the assumption that the volume of slumpedmass delineated by the
failure line is equal to the volume of discharged debris. In Fig. 18, an I–
D envelope for Pv=14% is also added to show the state of complete
slope toe collapse. At Pv=14%, a scarp was found approximately at
S=0.95 m, representing a critical moment of completely losing the
support of the toe. Note that in Fig. 18a–c, some data obtained at M9,
P5 (2.6, 0) and M5, P3 (1.7, 0) fall to the right of the I–D envelope.
However, moisture and piezometric measurements at the point M1,
P1 (0.95, 0) which is close to the steep-to-ﬂat transition of bedrock
generally show their validity as an accurate precursor of shallow slope
failures. Based on the observation in Figs. 16 to 18, Tm1, Tmp, and Tw1
obtained along the bedrock generally form I–D envelopes matching
with the envelopes for critical states of the slope (i.e., tin vs. D or t5% vs.
D), with minor exceptions in the case of an extremely intensive
rainfall of I=105 mm h−1. However, if the locus of soil moisture and
piezometric measurements is placed at a point close to the steep-to-
ﬂat transition of bedrock (see point M4, P2 (0.9, 0) in Fig. 16a–c; point
M2 (0.46, 0) in Fig. 17a; point M1, P1 (0.95, 0) in Fig. 18a–c), the
validity of using Tm1, Tmp and Tw1 as precursors for the onset of
shallow slope failures is obvious.
Based on the above observations, a new model of the internal
response envelope, schematically shown in Fig. 19, is proposed for
predicting shallow slope failures. Since the envelope of tin or t5% agrees
well with those for Tm1 and Tmp, the response times obtained along
the bedrock can be used as precursors of tin or t5%, indicating the onset
of abrupt debris discharge. The proposed theory of I–D envelopes is
based on constant-intensity rainfall tests, as shown by line a in Fig. 19.
The validity of the proposed theory for lines b and c will be examined
in the future based on more physical tests using temporally
nonuniform rainfall intensities and various slope and bedrock
conﬁgurations. An analytical model that incorporates hydro-geolog-
ical stability analyses to comprehensively describe the transient
process of slope failure and debris discharge is necessary.
9. Implications of the proposed framework of physically
based models
Accurate predictions of slope failure and debris ﬂow initiation can
be achieved by using integrated systems consisting of rainfall
thresholds, physically based model of slope failure, and piezometric
soil moisture measurement. Slope failure and debris ﬂow predictions
based on one or two of the above-mentioned components may be
with limited success (Keefer et al., 1987). The present study is a ﬁrst
step toward integrating rainfall thresholds, physically based models,
and soil moisture (or pore pressure) measurement. As a preliminary
study, the framework of a physically based model is developed based
on the experimental evidence. Existing physical-based models cannot
be applied directly to simulate the rainfall-induced slope failures
observed here because:
(1) A majority of physically based models for the stress analysis of
rainfall-induced slope failure (e.g., Okimura and Ichikawa,
1985; Pradel and Raad, 1993; Borga et al., 1998; Crosta, 1998;
Enoki, 1999; Collins and Znidarcic, 2004; Kim et al., 2004;
Meisina and Scarabelli, 2007; Lu and Godt, 2008; Godt et al.,
2009; Cho, 2009; Lee et al., 2009) were based on the
assumption of ‘inﬁnite slope’ which deviates from the ‘ﬁnite
slope’ used here. As pointed out by Huang et al. (2008, 2009),
ﬁnite slopes with a self-stabilizing toe zone have been studied
in natural colluvial hillslopes (e.g., Lumb, 1975; Jiao et al., 2005;
Gerscovich et al., 2006; Lacerda, 2007; Cascini et al., 2008).
Stability of a slope with a stabilizing slope toe cannot be
analyzed using the method of inﬁnite slope.
(2) Some of the developed physically based model focused on the
time-independent steady state inﬁltration within a homoge-
neous slope mass in which an impermeable baserock is absent
(Lu and Godt, 2008; Godt, et al., 2009). This model is
inapplicable for the slope with an impermeable base at a
relatively shallow depth, for which the failure is initiated by the
subsurface ﬂow along the soil-bedrock interface and the
subsequent instability of the slope toe, as indicated by the
conceptual model shown in Fig. 14.

the accuracy of slope failure predictions, a generic model that
describes the geomorphologic process of slope failures and debris
discharge is necessary. This requires a better understanding of the
internal-response-based slope failure mechanisms. We performed a
series of artiﬁcial rainfall tests on 0.84 m high, 2.29 m long, and
0.645 mwide sandy slopes, incorporating extensive soil moisture and
porewater pressure measurements and a debris discharge collection
system, to quantitatively relate the internal and external responses of
the slopes to rainfall. We also performed a comparative study on the
mechanism of rainfall-induced slope failures using the obtained
results and those from both reduced-scale and large-scale artiﬁcial
rainfall tests. Then a novel theory of internal response envelopes was
proposed. It is based on the widely adopted I vs. D framework, and is
also based on the experimental evidence that the internal soil
moisture and piezometric response envelopes obtained along the
bedrock are closely related to the critical moments of the rainfall-
induced slope failure. This theory will be generalized based on
numerical modeling for various slope materials, slope and bedrock
geometries, and I–D characteristics.
The following four ﬁndings validated those obtained from the
artiﬁcial rainfall tests reported by Huang et al. (2008, 2009), and
formed the basis of a new conceptual model of rainfall-induced
shallow slope failures:
(1) The external response of sandy slopes to rainfall is in the form
of retrogressive failure initiated by the instability and wash-out
of the slope toe. The process of retrogressive failure was
characterized by distinctive solid discharge curves, namely the
percentage of total solid volume discharge (Pv) vs. time (t)
curves with an transition point at the time tin, representing the
critical moment of transition from a minor toe failure into a
major retrogressive slope failure.
(2) The internal response of soil moisture content was characterized
by soil water content (ωs) vs. time (t) curveswith clear transition
and peak points representing the arrival of the wetting front and
the formation of a saturated ﬂow ﬁeld. The time of the ﬁrst
transition point (Tm1) measured using moisture sensors along
the impermeable base is a conservative indicator for the onset of
slope failure and subsequent abrupt debris discharge. The time of
peak moisture (Tmp) along the impermeable base is an accurate
indicator for the onset of slope failure.
(3) Internal responses of the porewater pressure in the model
sandy slopes are also characterized by the porewater pressure
head (hp) vs. time (t) curves. The time of an abrupt increase in
hp (Tw1) measured along the soil–bedrock interface signiﬁes
the start of interﬂow formation and positive porewater
pressure build-up around the slope toe. This response time is
close to the time of abrupt debris discharge initiation (tin), and
therefore is as important as Tm1 and Tmp as a precursor for the
onset of slope failure.
(4) Retrogressive shallow slope failures were initiated by the
collapse andwash-out of the slope toe, which resulted from the
saturation of the soil-bedrock interface, the lateral interﬂow
along the soil-bedrock interface, and the build-up of porewater
pressures or the mounding of a groundwater table around the
slope toe.
In summary, modeling the downward wetting front propagation,
the generation of interﬂow as a result of the saturation of the soil–
bedrock interface, and the pattern of interﬂow-induced groundwater
table around the slope toe is key to developing a generic model that
describes the process of rainfall-induced shallow slope failures.
