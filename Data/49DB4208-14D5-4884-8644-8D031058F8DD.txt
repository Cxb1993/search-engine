not available at each node due to the existence of 
the noise. As a result, how to develop a transceiver 
with the imperfect CSIs becomes an essential task in 
a realistic system. In this project, via considering 
the imperfect CSIs, we will propose a new robust 
transceiver in a MIMO relay system and discuss the 
related result.

mean-square error (MMSE) criterion was 
first studied in the literature [14]-[18]. 
Treating channel estimation errors as 
random variables, [14], [17], [18] derive 
robust relay precoders by minimizing the 
average minimum-mean-squared error 
(MMSE). In [15], the source and relay 
precoders are jointly derived with an 
iterative procedure minimizing the same 
MMSE criterion. An alternative criterion is 
to minimize the worst MSE performance 
[16], [18]. Although many works have been 
devoted into this subject, the capacity 
criterion, however, has seldom addressed. In 
this project, we consider a robust design for 
capacity maximization in three-node MIMO 
relay systems. For simplicity, only is the 
relay precoder adopted in our system. Since 
three independent channels are involved, the 
optimum design formulated as an 
optimization problem is difficult to conduct. 
To overcome the difficulty, we first consider 
a special case in which the direct link is 
ignored, referred to as a two-hop system, 
and no correlation exists between the 
transmit and receive antennae. In this special 
scenario, the structure for the optimum relay 
precoder can be derived. As a consequence, 
the optimization can be transferred into an 
scalar-valued concave optimization, and a 
closed-form optimum solution can then be 
derived by the Kurush-Khun-Tucker (KKT) 
conditions. For the general three-node case, 
the optimum relay precoder cannot be found 
since the optimization problem is 
complicated and non-convex. To obtain a 
tractable solution, we then propose using a 
lower bound of the capacity as the design 
criterion. With the lower bound, the 
optimization can be greatly simplified, and 
the corresponding closed-form solution can 
be obtained. Simulations show that the 
proposed transceiver designs can effectively 
enhance the performance when CSIs are 
imperfect.  
Section II. System Model 
  We consider a three-node AF MIMO 
relay precoding system in which N, R, and 
M antennas are placed at the source, the 
relay and the destination, respectively, as 
shown in Fig. 1. To avoid interference 
between the signals received from the source 
and relay, we adopt the general two-phase 
AF protocol [2]-[10]. In the first-phase, the 
source signal vector 1Ns   broadcasts to 
the relay and the destination. Then, the 
received signal at the relay is processed by a 
linear relay precoder and subsequently is 
transmitted to the destination in the 
second-phase. In this transmission interval, 
the source node keeps silence. Therefore, the 
signal received at the destination (after the 
two consecutive phases) can be combined 
into a single vector as [3]

the first-phase, that at the relay in the 
first-phase, and that at the destination in the 
second-phase.  
 In real-world systems, the channel 
responses are estimated and their values are 
quantized (for transmission). Thus, 
estimation and quantization errors always 
exist, and perfect CSIs are not obtainable. If 
the effect of imperfect CSIs is not taken into 
account, the performance of precoding will 
be seriously affect. To start with, we 
consider the following error model of the 
MIMO channel estimation.

ΔˆRD RD RD= +H H H           (4)

where ˆ SRH , ˆ RDH , and ˆ SDH  are the 
estimated channel matrices of HSR, HRD, and 
HSD, respectively; ΔHSR, ΔHRD, and ΔHSD 
are the corresponding estimation error 
matrices. The PDFs of HSR, ΔHRD, and ΔHSD 
can be expressed as:

(16) is simplified, the problem is not convex. 
We then propose using an equivalent 
optimization as described in the following 
proposition.

Then, T HT TT U Λ U  where UT is a matrix

original optimization into a scalar-valued 
convex optimization, obtaining the optimum 
closed-form solution. For the general 
three-link MIMO relay system, the problem 
is much more difficult to tackle. We then 
proposed maximizing a lower bound instead 
of the original objective function. With this 
lower bound, we can also derive a 
closed-form solution. Simulations show that 
the performance of the proposed method is 
superior to that of the non-robust method, 
especially when the correlation between 
transmit and the receive links is small.

Abstract—Most nonlinear transceiver designs in amplify-and-
forward (AF) multiple–input–multiple-output (MIMO) relay 
systems assume that instantaneous perfect channel state 
informations (CSIs) are available. Transceiver design with 
imperfect CSIs have rarely been addressed. In this paper, we 
consider an AF MIMO system in which a Tomlinson-Harashima 
precoder (THP) is used at the source, a linear precoder at the 
relay, and a minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver at 
the destination. With the imperfect CSIs, we propose a new 
robust transceiver design method. It is shown that the 
optimization problem for the design is difficult due to the fact 
that the objective function is a nonlinear function of the source 
and relay precoders and yet the constraints are coupled. To 
overcome the problem, we adopt the primal decomposition 
technique, decomposing the original optimization into a 
subproblem and a master problem. To facilitate the derivation of 
the solution, we propose cascading THP with a unitary precoder 
and using a lower bound of the objective function. In this way, we 
can translate the original matrix-valued optimization into the 
scalar-valued concave optimization. Using the Karush-Kuhn-
Tucker (KKT) conditions, we can finally obtain the closed-form 
solutions for the relay and source precoders. Simulations show 
that the proposed design is effective against the imperfect CSIs.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) relay system has received much attention 
since it can effectively boost system capacity or improve links 
reliability [1]-[7]. The source and relay can further adopt 
precoders to improve the performance [1]-[7]. It is well known 
that nonlinear transceivers are superior to the linear ones [5]-
[6]. In general, the design of precoders requires channel state 
informations (CSIs). However, in realistic systems, the perfect 
CSI is not available due to CSI quantization or channel 
estimation errors. The robust transceiver design for AF MIMO 
relay systems was rarely studied. In [7], a robust design for the 
two-hop system was considered. However, only a relay 
precoder was considered. In this paper, we consider an AF 
MIMO system where a Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (THP) 
is used at the source, a linear precoder at the relay, a 
minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver at the 
destination. Also, both the direct and relay links are jointly 
taken into the design [5]. With imperfect CSI, we propose a 
robust transceiver design method. 
Our design is to find the source THP, the relay precoder, 
and MMSE equalizer such that the MSE at the destination is 
minimized. However, since three imperfect channels and two 
couple power constraints are involved, the optimization is very 
difficult to conduct. To provide a solution, we first resort to 
the primal decomposition method, decomposing the 
optimization into a subproblem and a master problem. 
However, the couple power constraints still obstruct the 
optimization. Therefore, we further propose a unitary precoder 
cascaded to the THP, decoupling the constraints, facilitating 
the subproblem optimization and, most importantly, 
improving the MSE performance. As for the master problem, 
the objective function is still too complicated to tackle. We 
then propose using a lower bound of the objective function 
instead of the original one. As a result, we can transfer the 
master problem to a scalar-valued concave optimization.  
Closed-form solutions for the relay and source precoders can 
be obtained by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. 
Simulation shows that the proposed design can outperform its 
non-robust counterpart. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
A. System Model 
We consider a three-node AF MIMO relay precoding system 
in which N, R, and M antennae are placed at the source, the 
relay and the destination, respectively [5]. The transceiver 
consists of a TH source precoder, a linear relay precoder, and 
a linear MMSE receiver [5]. Here, we consider a two-phase 
protocol to avoid the interference between the source-
destination (direct) and source-relay-destination (relay) links

we can observe that the cost function and the power constraints 
are nonlinear and non-convex functions of SF  and RF . Even 
worse, two power constraints are coupled through FS. As a 
result, it is difficult to solve the problem directly. In the next 
section, we propose a new approach to seek the solution.  
 
III. PROPOSED ROBUST JOINT SOURCE/RELAY PRECODERS 
DESIGN 
A. Proposed Approach 
We resort to the primal decomposition method [10] 
translating (13) into a subproblem and a master problem.  The 
subproblem is first optimized for the source precoder, and 
subsequently the master problem is optimized for the relay 
precoder. To avoid the coupling problem of the constraints, we 
propose a unitary structure for FS. To proceed, we reformulate 
(13) as

Note that the primal decomposition can be further applied in 
the subproblem. Treating C , SF  and RF  as know entities, we

This result matches our intuition. Since the noise power can be 
reduced if the source power is increased. Substituting (16) into 
(14), we can see the relay power constraint is just the function 
of FR, and thus two power constraints are decoupled. Therefore, 
the constraint can be moved to the master problem. If we treat 
FS as a known matrix, the subproblem is degenerated to a 
point-to-point THP MIMO system, which can be expressed as

Now, the problem becomes the minimization of (21) which is 
the master problem. It is noteworthy that if unitary SF  is not 
included, the whole problem is much cumbersome due to the 
coupled power constraints. Equations (15)-(22) are similar with 
those derived in [5]. The difference lie in that iH  in (11) 
includes the channel uncertainties while that in [5] does not.

IV. SMULATIONS 
We consider a three-node AF MIMO relay system with 
N=R=M=4 and model the channel estimation error with 
covariance matrices as

where δ  and γ  are the correlation coefficient and 2eσ  is 
denoted as the estimation error variance. Let srSNR , rdSNR , 
and sdSNR  denote, respectively, the SNR per receive antenna 
of the source-to-relay, the relay-to-destination, and the source-
to-destination links. We use the 16-QAM scheme for each 
transmitted symbols. Fig. 1 shows the MSE performance for 
the TH source and linear relay precoded system (TH-L) [5] 
and the proposed robust TH source and linear relay precoded 
system (TH-L-robust). Here, we let 30srSNR =  dB, 
15sdSNR =  dB, rdSNR  be varied, and δ  = γ  = 0. As we 
can see, the performance gap between the TH-L and TH-L-
robust is increased when the CSI uncertainty is increased. 
Interestingly, we can find that the performance of non-robust 
systems slightly is degraded at the high SNR region. This is 
because noise can somehow offset the CSI uncertainty. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we consider a robust transceiver design for 
AF MIMO relay system with imperfect CSIs. The transceiver 
consists of a THP at the source, a linear precoder at the relay, 
and a MMSE receiver. The design can be easily formulated as 
an optimization problem. However, the problem is difficult to 
solve due to the complicated object function and constraints. 
With the cascade of a unitary precoder and the aid of a lower 
bound, we derive the closed-form solution by KKT conditions. 
Simulations show that the proposed robust design outperforms 
the non-robust one.
