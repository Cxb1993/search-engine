As above problems are considered, the proposed 
tracking algorithm can utilize clusters of sensor network
with handoff scheme in a heterogeneous wireless envi-
ronment. A handoff specified in IEEE 802.11 network is 
the process whereby a mobile station shifts its association 
from one access point (AP) to another [11]. When a mo-
bile station moves out of the range of an AP into another’s, 
the handoff occurs during which there is an exchange of 
management frames [12].
We present an architecture which utilizes clustering
analysis method with particle filter (PF) to track a moving 
target. Particle filter is a kind of suboptimal filter. It im-
plements sequential Monte Carlo simulation based on a 
set of particles to construct prior density with associated 
weights for the approximation of posterior density [20]. 
Particle filter utilizes recursive Bayesian approach to es-
timate the states of the target. There are algorithms using
recursive Bayesian estimate, such as Kalman filter [23], 
grid-based methods [21], particle filter, etc. These filters
consist of two levels of updates, time update and meas-
urement update. Time update is the process that predicts 
next state of system model. Measurement update utilizes
measurements to correct the estimation errors during the 
prediction stage of system model.
On the other hand, clustering analysis is the method 
of unsupervised learning. It may include two parts, 
namely, partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering.
Partitional clustering is a set of objects being classified 
into K clusters without hierarchical structure [15]. We 
utilize K-means clustering method which is a prototype-
based, widely-used simple partitional clustering tech-
nique [26]. The clustering method with PF can reduce the
degradation of NLOS propagation efficacy in tracking 
estimation results. And handoff scheme is applied in the 
cluster of sensor network. In clusters of sensor network, 
each cluster has numbers of sensor nodes, including TOA 
and RSSI sensors. Fig. 1 shows the proposed architecture 
that illustrates an event of target tracking in clusters of 
sensor network.
The general approach to processing the LOS/NLOS 
siagnals in cellular communication network is to deter-
mine whether it’s in LOS or NLOS condition.  Even the 
fuzzy inference scheme is introduced to tell whether it is 
LOS or NLOS before any processing jobs can be done [12].  
This fuzzy inference scenario is combined with adaptive 
Kalman filter to establish mobile location estimatior; un-
doubtly, sytem and computational complexities are in-
creasing so tremendously, hindering the potentials in 
real-time applications.
The advantageous features of the proposed scenario 
are listed as belows.
 Intuitive but feasible for real-time applications 
due to its low system and computational com-
plexity attributes
 No need to identify whether it is under LOS or 
NLOS condition prior to any processings of the 
target location estimation
 Only RSSI and TOA sensor measurements are 
required, practical and low-cost
 Both K-mean clustering and hand-off schemes 
are incorperated into the particle fiter, minimiz-
ing the system complexity to the most
This analysis is set up as follows. The target’s motion 
model and the associated measurement equation and 
NLOS propagation are described in section II. Particle 
filter is described in section III. Section IV discusses the 
proposed tracking algorithm which includes the handoff 
scheme. The proposed tracking algorithm with clustering 
method is derived in section V. The simulation and per-
formance analysis are presented in section VI. Section VII 
includes the conclusion and future work.
2 MOTION MODELS
This paper considers the modeling of a mobile target’s 
movement on a two-dimensional (2-D) plane [4]. Besides, 
the measurement of signal propagation with LOS/NLOS 
conditions may be modeled as a two-state Markov proc-
ess if the performance at transient stage is under investi-
gation [7]. The target and measurement models are 
shown as below.
2.1 Target Model
Assume that the moving target’s state vector can be de-
scribed as  Tyyxx kkkkk ,1x , consisting of position 
and velocity, where ()T stands for transpose operation of 
matrix. The target motion is modeled as:
1,11,11,1   kkk wA xx                   (1)

with covariance matrix Q1, i.e., w1, k-1 ~ N(0,Q1). The covari-

4 TRACKING ALGORITHM
The proposed tracking algorithm consists of handoff scheme 
and PF. The detail of PF is introduced in section III. In this 
section, we introduce the handoff scheme, and show how it 
can be incorporated into the tracking algorithm. Here the 
handoff scheme is utilized on clusters of sensor network. 
This technique is based on the receiving of signal strength 
measurements generated by the moving target, and each clus-
ter of RSSI sensors provides the signal strength indications to 
switch on/off the event of handoff.
For formulating the signal strength measurements, let j
k
be the signal strength received by a moving target from jth
RSSI sensor at the kth sampling instant. The received signal 
strengths can be modeled as a function of the distance plus a 
logarithm of the shadowing component [4], i.e.,
j
k

k p   dbm         (8)
j
kj
j
k dp log10               (9)
where j
kp is the local signal power at the kth sampling instant
[6];  is the path loss index;
j is a constant determined by 
the transmitted power, the wavelength, and the antenna gain 
of the jth RSSI sensor; j
kd is the distance between the mov-
ing target and the jth RSSI sensor; and j
k is the logarithm of 
the shadow fading, which is modeled by a zero mean Gaus-
sian random process.
The concept of the handoff algorithm is developed using 
the threshold method. The decision is made only if the cur-
rent signal strength drops below a user-defined threshold , 
and any other RSSI sensor’s strength is stronger than that of 
the current one. Here 1
kE is defined as the event with handoff
being triggered, and 0
kE is the non-handoff situation [2], [4], 
that is,

where
c is the received signal strength at moving target due 
to current RSSI sensor and
r is the received power at mov-
ing target owning to a reference RSSI sensor other than the 
current one. The conditional cost function is therefore defined

Handoff will occur from the current RSSI sensor to the 
candidate one, when the cost function )|( 1kr EC  is equal 
to 1 [4], [6]. If both (10) and (11) are not satisfied, it means 
that there is no handoff needed for clusters of sensor net-
work.
The candidate cluster of sensor network is chosen by 
handoff decision, and measurements can be expressed 
as j
kk zz  . Here the measurements follow the equation (4), 
and the given TOA measurement would be used in parti-
cle filter processing. Through PF processing, likelihoods
have to be changed accordingly with handoff decision for
each particle,    ikjkkk xzpxzp    . If choosing the wrong 
likelihood, it will cause the wrong weighting computation. 
After all, it leads to the inaccuracy estimation of target 
tracking.
5 TRACKING ALGORITHM WITH K-MEAN 
ALGORITHM
We present the tracking algorithm that combines PF and
handoff scheme, which is mentioned above in section IV. In 
addition, we propose a generic tracking method which re-
P0=diag{1000,100,10,1000,100,10}, and the measurement 
covariance matrix R is defined as a 20-by-20 diagonal ma-
trix, R=diag{25, 25,… , 25}. Fig. 4 shows the complete view 
of the simulation scenario, including sensors positions,
the actual and estimated trajectories, where the simula-
tion is build on a two-dimensional plane. Fig. 5 illustrates
the variation of received signal strengths, which are re-
layed to the activations of handoff events. Here these re-
ceived signals are measured by RSSI sensors, where the 
position of sensors C1, C2,… , C9 are located at each cluster 
of sensors, respectively. Hence, with the variation of sig-
nal strength at each cluster, the handoff event will be trig-
gered based on the equations (10) and (11).
According to the occurances of handoff events, the
switchings among the clusters in the sensor network are
shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 illustrates the state tracking of posi-
tion, velocity, and acceleration.  As shown in this figure, 
highly precise accuracies can be obtained. Fig. 8 depicts 
the RMSE values of estimations along x- and y-axis, in-
cluding position, velocity, and acceleration. 
6.2 Performance Analysis
During the simulation, we found that using the tracking 
algorithm in combination with K-means clustering eventu-
ally reduces the estimation error of position, velocity, and 
acceleration substantially. The comparison of root-mean-
square errors (RMSE) are shown in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9, the per-
formance of tracking algorithm with K-means clustering is 
outperforming the one without clustering. The comparison 
of error distributions due to the scenarios with and without 
the introduction of K-mean clustering algorithm are plotted 
in Fig. 10.  The average estimation errors after conducting 20 
Monte Carlo runs are denoted by Error1, solely with PF 
processing, whereas Error2 is incorporating with K-mean 
clustering method.  The probability that Error1 is strictly 
greater than Error2 is 73% in average, while 27% is the case, 
Error1 < Error2.  Similarly, assuming the possibility that Er-
ror1 will be strictly less than two times of Error2, the results 
are shown in Fig. 11 in the estimations of position, velocity, 
and acceleration.  The robustness of the proposed PF and K-
mean clustering technique to mitigate the NLOS effect is 
verified via simulation, as shown in both Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.
As proposed above, the tracking algorithm is established 
by particle filter, and particle numbers are set by user. Differ-
ent particle numbers may affect the filtering accuracy and 
processing speed for target tracking. Hence, we choose five 
sets of particle numbers to investigate the performance of 
tracking accuracy; there are 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 particles 
used for performance analysis. Environments for simulation 
are surrounded with either LOS or NLOS propagation.
We simulate the tracking estimation in a surrounded LOS 
propagation environment, and plot the means of estimation 
errors versus different numbers of particles, as shown in Fig. 
12. The results, with a surrounded NLOS propagation envi-
ronment, are shown in Fig. 13. In addition, Fig. 14 illustrates 
the performance with the employment of K-means clustering. 
As the simulation results shown in Fig. 12 to Fig. 14, each fig-
ure is simulated in 1000 time instants, and we compute its 
associated estimation errors, position, velocity, and accelera-
tion.
As position, velocity, and acceleration are estimated, not 
too much benefit can we expect in a LOS propagation envi-
ronment when we vary the number of particles in PF process-
ing.  The number of particles we choose is 50, being attractive
in real-time tracking applications.  The estimation errors 
gradually reduce with the increasing of particle numbers.  On 
the contrary, situated in a NLOS environment, substantial
improvement of estimation errors are illustrated in Fig. 14 
with k-mean clustering scenario; eventually, the trade-off 
among the increment of particle numbers, estimation errors, 
and computational load is accomplished via the use of mod-
erate number of particle, i.e., 50, and the augmentation of k-
mean clustering scheme in the particle filter processing job.
7 CONCLUSION
Sophisticated and high system/computational 
complexity algorithms are always proposed to mitigate 
the NLOS effect and estimate the mobile/target loca-
tion. In this article, we propose a simple and feasible 
generic tracking algorithm to track the moving target 
in clusters of sensor network. The proposed tracking 
algorithm is the technique that adds handoff decision 
to the ordinary tracking algorithm; the handoff deci-
sion is implemented on clusters of sensor network. The 
use of the proposed algorithm in clusters of sensor net-
work based on TOA and RSSI measurements has been 
investigated in this paper. Besides, K-means clustering 
is utilized, and it combines with particle filter to re-
duce the NLOS propagation effect. Finally, the pro-
posed algorithm could accomplish higher accuracy in 
tracking estimation.
Simulations illustrate that the estimation results of 
tracking trajectory is well predicted, even around the 
NLOS propagation environment. This analysis applies
to any motion modes, even with varying acceleration.  
Moreover, we also compare the results of tracking al-
gorithm with and without K-means clustering in statis-
tics. Through the performance analysis, it demon-
strates that the proposed tracking algorithm may find 
potential in real world applications as the particle 
numbers used are reducing to as low as 50.
