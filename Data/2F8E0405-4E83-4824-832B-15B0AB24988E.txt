Application of fuzzy Lyapunov method to dynamic analysis and 
control of oceanic structure 
 
NSC  98-2221-E-366-006-MY2 
 
2.Abstract： 
 
To take advantage of abundant oil and gas reserves in oceanic environments, it is necessary to dive 
into very deep waters. Many promising fuel fields lie beneath water 4000–7000 ft deep. The hull 
of a TLP system, a favored platform design in such environments, is connected to the seabed by 
tendon pipes, resulting in a stable structure. Since tendon length and water pressure increase 
proportionally to water depth, the capability of such pipes to withstand high resistance is critical, 
especially in deep-water environments. Instead of the tether drag effects used previously, in this 
study we discuss a novel concept of control force to stabilize a TLP system. This proposed system 
should be able to improve limitations of steel performance, allowing for maximum water depth 
attainable with a TLP system. Dependence of wave motion and structural surge motion are 
demonstrated. Analytical solutions demonstrate that the response of a floating structure can be 
calculated using certain parameters, including structural properties and wave characteristics. 
Subjecting a floating structure to wave forces results in vibration that can be rapidly suppressed 
using fuzzy controllers. 
 
Keywords：Tension leg platform, boundary value problem, kinematical boundary conditions, 
scattering problem, motion radiation problem, fuzzy Lyapunov, stability of fuzzy control.

Cylindrical piles are commonly used beneath coastal and marine structures (e.g., breakwaters, 
wharfs, quays, lighthouses, artificial islands and platforms for petroleum extraction), while 
submersible porous cylindrical structures are used for offshore and coastal aquaculture projects in 
relatively shallow and intermediate water depths. The primary reason for using cylindrical piles is 
to reduce the interaction between the sea waves and the marine structures. However, many 
innovative cost-saving floating offshore structures for deep-water offshore oil and gas exploration 
have been proposed. To minimize wave-induced motion, the natural frequency of these proposed 
offshore structures must be designed to be far from the peak frequency of the power spectra of the 
force. One type of floating structure utilized for deep water offshore drilling, production, 
processing, storage, and offloading of ocean deposits is the spar platform. A spar platform consists 
of a cylinder that floats vertically quite deep in the water. The force of the wave action on the 
surface is minimized by the counter-balancing effect of the structure’s weight. The 
semi-submerged tension leg platform (TLP), is another type of structure comprised of different 
materials with a working floating body on top. The effect of various parameters must be 
considered when designing the cylindrical piles used in these structures so as to reduce vibration in 
the offshore floating platform system. The parameters which affect the resonant frequency of the 
platform and mitigate the amplitude include the mass draft and dimensions of the platform and 
diameter of the floating barrel. A tuned liquid column damper can significantly reduce the peak 
value of the platform’s resonant frequency. The effectiveness of a tuned liquid column damper is 
more significant when the ratio of its width to length is high [33].  
Simplified models for investigating wave energy dissipation and surge motion on an 
impermeable marine structure with linearly elastic, pre-tensioned legs have already been 
developed [20, 23, 34]. The response of a floating body to wave forces has recently been studied 
numerically. In this study we present a novel approach for analyzing the dynamics of marine 
platforms. Zadeh [37] was the first to utilize a linguistic approach to simulate human thought 
processes and judgment. This has since been explored in many studies (see [1-2, 19] and the 
references therein). However, there was still a lack of mathematical theories and systematic 
designs, when Takagi and Sugeno [29] proposed their fuzzy inference system, now known as the 
Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, in 1985. The simplicity and naturalness of the concepts 
underlying this type of fuzzy model make it suitable for a variety of applications (for example, see 
[13, 17, 38] and the references therein). The T-S-type fuzzy models combine linguistic rule 
descriptions of system operation with traditional functional descriptions of the same. This local 
description of system operation, which is a linear description, is relatively easy to identify. The 
 4
stability is considered, and the effects of drag surge vibration on the TLP system, which occurs as a 
consequence of the interaction between the waves and the structure if investigated. Stability 
analysis is carried out and the influence of the fuzzy controller on platform motion, when an actual 
deformable TLP is incorporated into the solution, is looked at. The solution is presented as a 
comparison of responses between the platform, with and without fuzzy controllers. In addition, the 
effects of various parameters on the floating structure, water waves and the fuzzy controller system 
are also investigated. 
 
2. Mathematical formulation 
2.1 Initial boundary value problem for fluid–structure interaction 
Fig. 1a shows a drawing of a stationary cubical element. The mass inside a fixed surface 
bounding a closed volume will increase if mass flows into the volume and decrease if it flows out. 
The inflow and outflow processes are shown in Fig. 1b. For incompressible fluids the fluid density 
is constant throughout the flow field. Thus  
0V =⋅∇ →  [24]. (1) 
 
 
(a)                                (b) 
Figure 1 A differential element for the development of the conservation of mass equation. 
 
Here, the fluid is considered inviscid, and the flow is assumed to move from rest so that it is 
irrotational. Therefore, fluid velocity can be described by the gradient of velocity potential 
Ф(x,z,t) in the fluid domain, i.e., Ф(x,z,t). The governing equation for this problem satisfies 
the Laplace equation for velocity potential, i.e.,

employed. As shown in the sketch of a 2D numerical wave flume, a plane z=0 coincides with the 
undisturbed still water level and the z-axis is directed vertically upward. The vertical elevation of 
any point on the free surface can be defined by the function z=η(x,y,t), in which the surface tension 
is negligible. As depicted in Fig. 2, -∞ <x < -b, where the total velocity potential ФI in Region I 
consists of incident waves Ф , scattered waves Ф  and motion radiation waves Фi IS IW. In Region II, 
-b < x < b, and in Region III, b < x < ∞; the total velocity potentials Ф  and ФII III consist of both 
scattered ФIIS and Ф  and radiated waves ФIIIS IIW and ФIIIW. Subscript s denotes the scattering 
problem and subscript w denotes the wave-maker (i.e., primitive radiation) problem induced by the 
platform surge motion. Displacement of the surge motion with an unknown amplitude S is given 
by -iσt= Se  and platform deformation on the x-axis is defined as S. X
It is assumed that there is no flow across any fluid interface, in other words, fluid particles can 
only move in a direction tangential to the fluid interface. The required kinematic boundary 
conditions (see Appendix A) are as follows:

nUn
=∂
∂φ  on the rigid boundaries, (4) 
where a << λ for small-amplitude waves and we can neglect the non-linear convective term; and n 
is the outward normal to the boundary. Furthermore, the application of the linearized condition at 
z=0 instead of z=η  results in the kinematic boundary condition wt =∂∂ /η , suggesting that the 
vertical velocity component of the fluid at the interface must be equal to the interface velocity. 
When the rigid boundaries are stationary on the seabed, the normal velocity component Un 
becomes zero. 
The dynamic boundary condition (see Appendix B) on the free surface is utilized to calculate 
the dynamic pressure and horizontal fluid velocity. The dynamic conditions on the free surface are 
derived based on the conservation of linear momentum. Briefly, the discontinuity in the normal 
stress is proportional to the mean curvature of the free surface caused by surface tension

where C is the Bernoulli constant. When the atmospheric pressure is zero, term P will also be 
equal to zero. In free-surface problems, nonlinearity in the potential flow problem is only derived 
from free-surface boundary conditions when inviscid and incompressible fluid and irrotational 
flow assumptions are made. For small amplitude waves, the high order terms in the free surface

Linear feedback control techniques can be utilized for feedback stabilization in a T-S type 
fuzzy model. The plant is represented by a T-S type fuzzy model in which the local dynamics in 
different state-space regions are represented by linear models. The overall model can be achieved 
by the fuzzy “blending” of these linear models via nonlinear fuzzy membership functions. 
4.2 Stability of fuzzy control 
The momentum equation can be obtained from the motion of the floating structure derived 
from Newton’s second law. Assume that the momentum equation of a TLP system is controlled by 
actuators that can be characterized by the following differential equation:

system or an active mass damper); )(trM φ is a wave-induced external force that can be expressed 
as

horizontal component of the static (or the pre-tensioned) tension applied by the tension legs. The

Example 1: 
Figure 5 presents wave-induced structural responses with respect to several conditions (Table 
1). Figure 5 represents the initial conditions considering the displacement and velocity of the 
floating structure. In the cases of small wave amplitude, the physical values of the structure can be 
rapidly stabilized to zero using the fuzzy controllers (Fig. 5). The results demonstrate that the TLP 
system is stable under arbitrary harmonic excitation. Periodic wave fluctuation is apparent, 
implying that control forces enhance the decay of structural displacement and motion velocity over 
time.

these graphs shows that the TLP system is stable. Note that the trajectories for the three different 
conditions starting from the initial non-zero states all approach close to the origin under arbitrary 
harmonic excitation. This demonstrates that the effects of the control force have acted on the TLP 
system to stabilize the oceanic structure. A comparison of the results for these three figures shows 
the periodic wave fluctuation. The implication is that the control force enhances the decay of the 
structural displacement and motion velocity over time. The results of analysis show that despite the 
fact that much progress has been made in successfully applying a passive control force to TLP 
system, many basic issues remain that need to be further addressed. Firstly, traditional structural 
design depends on structural strength, and the capability to dissipate energy arising from dynamic 
forces such as machine loading, wind forces and earthquakes. The control effects can be improved 
by the active control forces. Secondly, stability analysis and systematic design are certainly among 
the most important issues for active control systems. The proposed T-S fuzzy model and PDC 
fuzzy control (based on Lyapunov functions) can easily ensure stabilization of TLP structures. The 
simulation results demonstrate the TLP system to be stable. The trajectory of the initial conditions, 
starting from non-zero initial states, is kept within certain bounds under wave excitation.

6. Conclusion 
To take advantage of abundant oil and gas reserves in oceanic environments, it is necessary to dive into 
very deep waters. Many promising fuel fields lie beneath water 4000–7000 ft deep. The hull of a TLP system, 
a favored platform design in such environments, is connected to the seabed by tendon pipes, resulting in a 
stable structure. Since tendon length and water pressure increase proportional to water depth, the capability of 
such pipes to withstand high resistance is critical, especially in deep-water environments. Instead of the tether 
drag effects used previously, in this study, we discuss a novel control force concept for the stabilization of a 
TLP system. This proposed technique should be able to improve the limitations of steel performance, allowing 
for an increase in the maximum water depth attainable with a TLP system. Dependence of wave motion and 
structural surge motion are demonstrated. Analytical solutions demonstrating the response of a floating 
structure are calculated using certain parameters, including structural properties and wave characteristics. 
Model results show that vibration due to subjecting a floating structure to the force of the waves results can be 
rapidly suppressed using fuzzy controllers. The fuzzy control system causes the resonant phenomenon to 
disappear in the model.

Second Year: Controller Design of Fuzzy Lyapunov Method 
1. Introduction 
 36
Most real-life systems used in today’s technology have serious non-linearity and uncertainty issues which 
have made it difficult for engineers to develop and design a suitable model to deal with this problem. In the 
last four decades, various schemes have been developed, one of the most important of which is fuzzy logic 
theory. The development of fuzzy logic theory was first initiated by Zadeh (1965) who proposed a linguistic 
approach that simulated the thought processes and judgment of human beings. Since then this field has been 
explored further, both theoretically and practically, among which a popular usage method is fuzzy control. 
Although fuzzy control provides an effective solution to real-life plants that are complex, uncertain and 
ill-defined, it lacks available mathematical theories and systematic designs. Therefore, heuristic methods are 
and Wang (2001) proved that the T-S fuzzy model and PDC technique are approximate nonlinear terms by 
judiciously chosen linear terms. This procedure leads to a reduction of the number of linear model rules. The 
number of linear model rules is directly related to complexity of the stability analysis and LMI conditions to 
be solved because the rule number is generally the combination of the fuzzy model and fuzzy control rules. 
Owing to the locally linear structure of the representation, the stability of the plant and controlled systems 
which is described in the T-S form is easy to prove.  
  With increasing research activities in the field of structural control, many control methods have been 
proposed such as optimal control, fuzzy control, pole placement, and sliding mode control (see Yeh et al., 
1996; Lu et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2003 and the references therein). However, to the best of our knowledge, the 
modeling, robustness design and stability analysis for time-delay TLPs via the fuzzy Lyapunov method have 
not been discussed as of yet. For this reason, here we propose a fuzzy control technique as well as a fuzzy 
Lyapunov method to deal with the stability problem of TLPs. From which the study of a suitable 
mathematical model of the TLP system and the interaction between a deformable floating structure and 
surface wave motion are discussed in virtue of a partial differential equation as well as fuzzy logic theory. In 
particular, a set of PDC fuzzy controllers on a platform are considered in order to explore the effects on the 
dragged surge vibration of the TLP system with the interaction of waves and structure. It is the purpose of this 
study to examine the stability analysis and the influence of the fuzzy controller on platform motion when the 
true behavior of the deformable TLP is included in the solution. Along with the solution which is presented as 
a comparison of the responses between the platform with and without fuzzy controllers, the influences of 
parameters on the floating structure, the water waves and the fuzzy controller system are also studied.  
 
2. PDC design for a tension leg platform system 
According to previous research, the momentum equation can be obtained from the motion of the floating 
structure (see Chen et al., 2010 and the references therein), extensively derived from Newton's second law. 
Assume that the momentum equation of a TLP system controlled by actuators can be characterized by the 
following differential equation:  
)()()( trMtUBtXM φ−=&&  ,                              (1)      
)(  ),(  ),( tXtXtX &&&nn Rtxtxtx ∈= )]()(),([ 21 L)(tX  is an n-vector; where are the acceleration, velocity, 
and displacement vectors, respectively; B  is a (n×m) matrix denoting the locations of m control forces; U(t) 
corresponds to the actuator forces (generated by the active tendon system or an active mass damper, for 
example). It should be noted that this is only a static model; and )(trM φ is a wave-induced external force 
which can be expressed as 
TXwx FFtrM −=)(φ , (2) 
where  is the horizontal wave force acting on the both sides of the structure; and  is the horizontal wxF TxF
 38
for all t. 
To ensure the stability of the TLP system, the concept of PDC is employed and designed to determine the 
structures of the fuzzy controllers. The fuzzy controller is in the following form:  
Controller Rule i: IF  gig i MtxMtx    is  )( and  and    is  )( 11 L
         THEN ,   (i =1, 2,…, )  ,                   (8) )()( tXKtU i−= r
where  is the local feedback gain vector in the ith subspace. The final model-based fuzzy 
controller is analytically represented by

3. Robustness design method for modeling errors 
 
According to the above fuzzy model (5) and the PDC scheme (9), the model of a time-delay TLP 
system can be represented by the following closed-loop controlled system:

This means that the modeling error is bounded by the matrix H . The proofs for Eq. (11) and the procedures 
for determining δ  and  have been provided in Chen et al., 1999. H
4. Fuzzy Lyapunov criterion  
Below, linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions are derived via Lyapunov theory to check the stability 
of time-delay T-S fuzzy systems. Given an LMI of , the LMI problem is to find  such that 
 or determine that the LMI is infeasible. This is a convex feasibility problem. An LMI definition 
is clearly described in Lu et al. (1998) and Boyd et al. (1994).

5. Numerical Results 
The objective of this investigation is to design a PDC fuzzy controller so that the time-delay TLP system 
is ensured to be stable. The proposed controller design is described below. With the assumption of several 
given conditions in Table 1, we apply the T-S fuzzy control method to ensure the stability of the time-delay 
TLP system by the following operations.  
Step 1: The number of rules is minimized to decrease the design complexity. Hence, the time-delay TLP 
system can be represented by the following two rules: 
Rule 1: IF  is            Rule 2: IF  is  )(1 tx ))(( 111 txM )(1 tx ))(( 121 txM

into very deep waters. Many promising oil fields are situated under water that is in the 4000 - 7000 ft depth 
range. A favored platform design in that environment is the TLP system, where the hull is connected to the 
seabed by strings of tendon pipes, to produce a stable structure. Since tendon length as well as water pressure 
increase in proportion to the water depth, it is essential that the tendon pipes be highly resistant to collapse, 
especially in deep water environments. We present here a new control force concept for the stabilization of 
time-delay TLP systems, an alternative to the tether drag effects used previously. We conclude from the 
present study that this new controller improves on the limitations of steel performance for the maximum water 
depth attainable with the TLP system. Therefore, the contribution in this paper is to develop an approach for 
the design of control laws for a time-delay TLP system under external wave forces based on robustness design 
and the ∞H  control requirement. Stability conditions are derived in terms of fuzzy Lyapunov’s theory to 
ensure the stability in the presence of plant perturbations. A simulation of the proposed approach was 
conducted which showed the superior performance of the proposed control methodology.

Abstract— The neural-network (NN) model is employed to 
represent a TLP system via the back propagation algorithm. 
Meanwhile, a linear differential inclusion (LDI) state-space 
representation is constructed for the dynamics of the NN model. 
The LDI equation is similar to T-S fuzzy system and is easier to 
analyze the stability of controlled systems. To achieve the control 
performance, the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme 
which combines with 
∞H  control design is proposed to ensure 
the stability of TLP systems subjected to an external wave force.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The development fuzzy logic theory was first initiated by 
Zadeh (1965) which proposed a linguistic approach to 
simulate the thought process and judgment of human beings. 
Since then many successful works on industrial and 
academic fields have explored this field further, among 
which a popular usage is fuzzy control. Although fuzzy 
control provides an effective solution to the real-life plants 
that are complex, uncertain and ill-defined, it lacks available 
mathematical theories and systematic designs. Therefore, 
heuristic methods are frequently developed in fuzzy control 
systems. Besides, in today’s technology, the dimension and 
nonlinearity become increasingly large such as large-scale 
systems and economic systems etc. In order to overcome 
these problems, the IF-THEN rules in fuzzy control have to 
increase to achieve the requirement of control performance. 
From the physical properties of control systems, some 
concepts such as stability, controllability and robustness 
should be considered. 
Because the concept of this kind of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) 
fuzzy model is nature and simple, many significant 
applications are proposed (for example, see Chen, 2006; 
Hsieh et al., 2006; Cococcioni et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006 
and the references therein). The T-S type fuzzy models 
combine the linguistic rule description with the traditional 
functional description of the system operation. This local 
description of the system operation which is linear 
description in particular is relatively easy to identify. Any 
complicated and nonlinear system surfaces could be 
represented by a set of flat linear segments and the segment 
can be described by one rule of the T-S fuzzy model. 
Because the design of linear controllers in a well-developed 
procedure, the formulation of T-S model is suitable to 
describe a nonlinear controller especially for the working 
points (operating sectors). Based on the usage of T-S fuzzy 
models, the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) fuzzy 
controllers are readily created. The PDC approach with a 
model-based design procedure was first proposed by Sugeno 
and Kang (1986). The PDC is a technique for designing a 
fuzzy controller from a given T-S fuzzy model. That means 
each control rule is constructed from the corresponding rule 
of a T-S fuzzy model in the PDC design procedure. 
Therefore, the real systems such as mechanical systems, 
chaotic systems, and resonant systems and so on can been 
represented by T-S fuzzy models and PDC controllers are 
designed to achieve the control object. Each fuzzy 
implication is expressed by a linear system model so that we 
can use linear feedback control as in the case of feedback 
stabilization. Because a linear feedback control is designed 
for each local linear model, the resulting overall nonlinear 
controller is a fuzzy blending of each individual linear 
controller. This so-called T-S fuzzy model and PDC control 
technique were analyzed in Tanaka and Sugeno (1992) and 
Wang et al. (1995). From the analysis results, T-S fuzzy 
model and PDC technique are quite simple and nature for the 
stability analysis of the control systems. Moreover, the 
stability analysis and control design problems can be reduced 
to linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems (see Chen et al., 
2004; Chen et al., 2006; Tanaka & Wang, 2001 and the 
references therein). The controller design and stability 
problems can be transformed into solving LMI problems. In 
order to exactly represent the nonlinear model, we have to 
use many linear segments to derive a fuzzy model without 
simplifying the original nonlinear model. Using the local 
approximation idea, Tanaka and Wang (2001) proved the T-
S fuzzy model and PDC technique are to approximate 
nonlinear terms by judiciously chosen linear terms. This 
procedure leads to reduction of the number of linear model 
rules. The number of linear model rules is directly related to 
complexity of stability analysis and solving LMI conditions 
because the rule number is generally the combination of the 
fuzzy model and fuzzy control rules. 
The effect of modeling error between nonlinear systems 
and T-S fuzzy models is not addressed even though this 
modeling error might influence the performance of the 
controlled systems. Therefore, the NN based approach is 
proposed to overcome the modeling error between the

IV. CONCLUSION 
The stability analysis of the TLP system is discussed in 
this paper. A new concept of control force is presented to 
stabilize the TLP system, instead of the tether drag effects as 
used in previous works. In this paper, an approach for the 
design of control laws for a TLP system under external wave 
forces was developed based on NN-based approach and the 
∞H  control requirement. 
 
V. FUTURE RESEARCH 
The traditional way to prepare for a tender is by 
mobilizing manpower and material resources. The 
preparation for appraisal for tender projects can lead to 
considerable accumulation and consumption of routine costs. 
The model developed in this study can be used to preview 
fund-related requirements. Reference information can be 
obtained from earlier decision making. The method helps to 
significantly lower the costs mentioned above which 
improves the contractor’s competitiveness.
