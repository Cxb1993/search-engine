nonlinear optical applications from their study.13 
In 2002, Lee and his co-workers14,15 synthesized 
2,6-diphenylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d’]bisthiazole 
derived chromophores and the calculated result 
of hyperpolarizability (β) showed an attractive 
attention for nonlinear optical applications.

  In this work, we describe the synthesis of 
side chain NLO polyimide through the 
hydroxyl-containing chromophores which are 
reacted with pre-imidized hydroxyl-containing 
polyimide via post-Mistunobu reaction. Such 
polyimides show excellent chemical and 
thermal stability due to the all aromatic 
structure. The polyimides thus prepared are 
further coated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass 
plate and poled by in-situ poling method for the 
measurement of electrooptic coefficient (r33).

Results and Discussion 
Synthesis and Characterization of 
Polyimides 
In our approach for synthesizing NLO 
polyimides, the first step was to synthesize the 
functional polyimides with hydroxy groups as 
side functional groups. The hydroxy groups can 
react with the other hydroxy group on the V-b 
and V-g to form ether linkage and in such way 
different NLO-active chromophores attached 
into the backbone can be designed. Sample II 
was synthesized from 2,4-diaminophenol 
dihydrochloride and 6FDA in NMP. After poly 
(amic acid) was formed at the low temperature, 
imidization was completed by loading toluene 
at azeotropically reflux. In such way, 
imidization at lower temperature (about 160 oC) 
can avoid the unexpected reaction or oxidation 
occurred on hydroxy groups. The characteristic 
absorptions of imide (Figure 1) were found at 
788, 1729, 1358, 1112 and 721 cm-1. Complete 
imidization was also proven by the absence of 
C=O and N-H stretching in the FTIR 
spectrum.II-g was synthesized from 
4,4-diamino-4-hydroxytri-phenylmethane and 
6FDA in NMP and imidization at 175oC. The 
characteristic absorptions of imide (Figure 2, 
Figure 3) were found at 1724, 1374, 1102 and 
721 cm-1. The completed imidization was also 
proven by the absence of C=O and N-H 
stretching in the FTIR spectrum.

In this work, V-b and V-g were chosen to 
react with II and IIa.by the Mistunobu 
reactions. The corresponding loading of 
chromophores (V-b and V-g) was based on the 
OH mole equivalence in the repeating unit of II

initiated at lower temperatures from the 
breakage of cyanoethyl chains, amide or nitro 
groups. The followed formation of 
benzobisthiazoles in VIII-b, VIII-f and VIII-g 
reinforced the thermal stability again. However 
the nitro groups in benzobisthiazole derived 
chromophores and ether linkages are the 
weakest parts for thermal resistance and they 
decomposed firstly during the heating, so the 
thermal stability performed worse than PI for 
the hjgher char yield at 800 oC. 
  VIII-b has a Tg of 327 oC by TMA. VIII-f 
has a Tg of 332 oC by TMA. The all aromatic  
benzobisthiazole derived chromphore was 
expected to have higher thermal resistance, but 
the existence of ether linkage makes the side  
Figure 7 UV of sample F 
Figure 8 UV of sampleG 
 
 
chains more flexible. This assumption was  
evidenced by TMA and TGA. From TMA, II 
has higher Tg than VIII-b that indicated the 
more flexibility contributed from the ether 
linkage. The thermal stability was therefore 
enhanced by incorporating the 
benzobisthiazole-derived chromophore and the 
existence of ether linkage makes chromophore 
orientate. This is greatly different from other 
most reported NLO polyimides. Compared with 
other most NLO polyimides containing 
azo-chromophores,4-8 VIII-b, VIII-f and VIII-g 
has outstanding thermal properties for its high 
Tg and thermal stability for its decomposition 
temperature list in table 2. 
 
Solubility of the polyimides 
With incorporating 6FDA in the polymide 
backbone, II, IIa, VII-b, VII-f and VIII-g were 
easily solubility in NMP. The poly(amic acids) 
can therefore be cylcized into polyimides 
directly in NMP by refluxing without any 
precipitation. VII-b, VII-f and VII-g was 
therefore prepared in NMP and along the 
reaction proceeding, the formed amide groups 
increased itself solubility in NMP. With the 
good solubility of those polyimides in NMP, it 
is easy for the process to fabricate NLO-PI 
(VIII-b, VIII-f and VIII-g) as thin films. 
NLO-PI was insoluble in general organic 
solvents due to its all aromatic structure. Since 
the resultant polyimides were formed as a thin 
film state and can be utilized for the end use, 
like spin-coated on ITO glass plate. The
