Abstract 
Three samples of aluminum-based water treatment residuals (Al-WTR1, Al-WTR2, 
and Al-WTR3) were assessed as adsorbent for boron removal. The Al-WTRs were 
mainly composed of Al2O3, Fe2O3, and SiO2. The adsorption reaction could be 
approximated by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium pH (pHe) 
affected boron adsorption and the optimum pHe was found at 8.2 – 8.5. The Langmuir 
model described the adsorption data satisfactorily (R2 value average ≧ 0.990), and 
the batch maximum adsorption capacities were found as 0.980, 0.700, and 0.190 mg/g 
using three samples, respectively, at pH value of 8.3  0.2. Thermodynamic analysis 
revealed that the adsorption reaction was spontaneous and exothermic. The ΔHo value 
was low (- 1.58 kJ/mol), and that was indicative of a physical adsorption. Electrostatic 
interactions and van der Waals force were proposed as major driving forces of 
adsorption under different pH conditions. Both BET specific surface area and 
aluminum content of Al-WTRs affected boron adsorption, as judged by the fact that 
Al-WTR1 showed higher adsorption density than the other two. The results of this 
study show that Al-WTRs can be used as an alternative adsorbent for boron removal.

Al-WTRs were washed with deionized water several times until conductivity was 
constant to remove some impurities. The Al-WTRs were oven-dried at 105oC 
overnight, crushed, and then sieve to a size below 150 μm (100 mesh) for adsorption 
experiments.  
The Al-WTRs were characterized for chemical compositions using aqua 
regia-HF procedure in a Teflon closed vessel [14]. It was triplicated since the 
Al-WTRs are heterogeneous and could be affected by properties of raw water and 
coagulant [11]. Surface area of Al-WTRs was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller 
(BET) instrument (Quantachrome, BET Autosorb-1). Field-emission scanning electron 
microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopes (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6400F 
with EDS) was used to examine the surface morphology and composition of Al-WTRs. 
The crystal structure of the Al-WTRs was determined by the X-ray diffractometer 
(Rigaku, D/Max-RC) with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation source at 40 kV 
and 100 mA, with a scanning rate of 0.05 deg s-1 in the 2θ range from 20 to 80o. The 
iso-electric point (pHiep) of Al-WTRs was determined by using zeta potential analyzer 
(Malvern, Zetasizer 2000).  In the measurement, 0.01 g of the Al-WTRs was 
dispersed into 1 L of NaCl solution (0.01 M, Acros, >99%), and its pH value was 
adjusted with HCl (0.1 N, Fischer Scientific, 36% solution) or NaOH (0.1 N, Fischer 
Scientific). 
Batch adsorption experiments were carried out by putting 100 mL of 
wastewater in 250-mL plastic bottles and adjusting its pH values with sodium 
hydroxide (1M) and nitric acid (1M, Acros, 65% solution). A certain amount of the 
Al-WTRs was then added into plastic bottle. The mixture was placed in a shaker with 
water bath (Firstek Scientific) at pre-determined temperature for certain time. At the 
end of the experiment the solution was centrifuged (EBA 3S, Hettich) and filtered by 
using a 0.2 μm PVDF membrane (Advantec). Finally, the filtrates were analyzed for 
residual boron concentration using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectrophotometer (ICP-AES JY2000, Horiba Jobin Yvon). The detection limit of 
ICP-AES was 0.015 mg/L for boron at the wavelength of 249.77 nm. Argon plasma of 
1,000 W at 12 L/min flowrate, and Meinhard nebulizer was used at flowrate of 1 L/min. 
Adsorbed boron was calculated from the difference between the initial and equilibrium 
concentrations. The adsorption experiments were done in triplicate samples and the 
average value was taken. The Al-WTR1 was used to investigate factors that may affect 
boron adsorption, such as pH, initial boron concentration, and temperature.

where qe is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg g
−1); k2 the rate constant of the 
pseudo-second order equation (g mg−1 min−1); qt the amount of boron adsorbed per 
unit mass of the adsorbent (mg g−1). The value of the parameter and the correlation 
coefficients obtained by using non-linear regression was calculated the error analysis of 
the kinetic parameters was done by calculation of a normalized standard deviation. The 
error function was calculated by equation below:

where n = the number of data points. Results are tabulated in Table 2. The correlation 
coefficient for the pseudo-second order kinetic model was found to be 0.930, which 
was higher than the pseudo-first order kinetic model. It implies that the rate of the 
adsorption reaction could be approximated by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model.  
 
3.3 Effect of equilibrium pH on B adsorption 
The effect of equilibrium pH was investigated by conducting experiment at 
room temperature, initial boron concentration of ca. 20 mg/L, adsorbent dose 
(Al-WTR1) of 25 g/L, shaking rate of 100 rpm, and reaction time of 24 h. Borate ion 
(B(OH)4
-) can be formed by the hydrolysis of boric acid (H3BO3) with pKa of 9.2. 
Therefore, borate concentration in the solution and its adsorption are both 
pH-dependent. Depending upon the nature of adsorbents, it has been reported that the 
optimum pH of boron adsorption is 2 for fly ash [16], 6.0 for composite magnetic 
particles [17], 7 for neutralized red mud [5], and 9 for layered double hydroxide [2]. 
Figure 4 shows that pH affected boron adsorption density on Al-WTR1 over a wide 
pH range of 3.5 - 11.0. An adsorption maximum was found at pH of 8.3 – 8.5, where 
non-ionic B(OH)3 is the dominant species in aqueous solution.. The pHiep of adsorbent 
has an important role in case electrostatic interaction is the major driving force in the 
adsorption reaction. Adsorption of the oxyanions is favorable when pH < pHiep because 
the adsorbent surface is positively charged. The pHiep of Al-WTR1 was 6.1. 
Considering that Al-WTR is a heterogeneous mixture of Al2O3, Fe2O3, SiO2 and 
organic compounds, the adsorption of boron can be discussed in detail. The typical 
pHiep of hydrous Al2O3 and Fe2O3 of unknown structure was 9.0, and 9.2, respectively; 
whereas it was around 2.4 – 3.0 for SiO2 [18]. Boron can be adsorbed via complex 
formation, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals force. For example, it has been

showed weak affinity toward Al-WTRs. The maximum boron adsorption density is 
1.965 mg/g on activated alumina [20], 3.39 mg/g on calcined alunite [7], 5.85±0.39 
mg/g on reagent grade magnesia [22], 30.12 mg/g on neutralized red mud [5], and 
37.7 mg/g on layered double hydroxide [2]. For comparison, the maximum phosphate 
adsorption density is 3.5 to 0.7 mg/g from pH 4.3 to 9.0 on alum sludge [11], and 
maximum fluoride adsorption density is 0.2798 mg/g on Al-WTRs and 0.8418 mg/g on 
acetic acid activated Al-WTRs [10].  
The sequence of the BET surface area is A1-WTR1 > Al-WTR2 >> Al-WTR3. 
The adsorption density is highly correlated with specific surface area. It is noted that 
Al-WTR3 with the lowest surface area showed the lowest adsorption density. In the 
meantime, it is possible that alumina (Al2O3) content in the adsorbent would affect 
boron adsorption as well. Adsorption of boron is significantly correlated with the 
aluminum oxide content [4]. However, BET surface area has been shown to be more 
determining than alumina content of boron adsorption on Siral [9]. A1-WTR1 that had 
the highest aluminum content and highest BET surface area showed highest boron 
adsorption density than the other two. 
The effect of temperature was studied by varying the temperature from room 
temperature to 60oC at pHe value of 8.3  0.2. Figure 7 shows that adsorption density 
of boron slightly decreased with increasing temperature and the Langmuir isotherm 
model was found to fit experimental data well (Table 4). In thermodynamic studies, 
the amounts of boron adsorbed at 25, 40, and 60◦C were calculated to obtain the 
thermodynamic parameters, such as standard Gibbs free energy change (∆Go), standard 
enthalpy change (∆Ho), and standard entropy change (∆So). The molar free energy 
change of the adsorption process is related to the equilibrium constant (KL) and can be 
calculated from the following equation: 
∆Go = −RT ln KL       (5) 
where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T the absolute temperature, and ∆Go the 
standard Gibbs frees energy change and KL the Langmuir constant (L/mol). Standard 
enthalpy change, ∆Ho, and standard entropy change, ∆So, of adsorption can be 
estimated using the Van’t Hoff equation as shown below:

A plot of ln KL against 1/T renders a straight line, as shown in Fig. 8. The slope of the 
plot is equal to −∆Ho/R and its intercept value is equal to ∆So/R. The thermodynamic 
parameters were calculated and tabulated in Table 5. Adsorption was a spontaneous 
process, since its free energy change was negative (ΔGo < 0). The positive value of ΔSo 
(43.15 J/mol K) suggests the increased randomness at the solid/liquid interface during 
boron adsorption onto Al-WTRs. The negative value of ΔHo (-1.58 kJ/mol) of boron

ABSTRACT 
 
This study investigated chemical reaction  and chemical reaction followed by 
microfiltration  processes for treating synthetic tunnel construction wastewater, which 
was characterized as high in total suspended solids (2.53±0.36 g/L) and in soluble silica 
(1.41±0.2 g/L). The optimal chemical reaction conditions were assessed through jar 
test apparatus. Experimental results indicated that calcium chloride (CaCl2) could 
reduce soluble silica to 187.1 mg/L at pH 8.0 and dosage of 1,000 mg/L. The 
treatment efficiency deteriorated as pH increased, while increasing CaCl2 dose at pH 
8.0 did not enhance removal of silica. Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) could lower 
soluble silica concentration to 174.0 mg/L at pH of 8 and 9, and soluble silica 
concentration decreased further as MgCl2 dosage increased. Wastewater pretreated 
with CaCl2 and MgCl2 was then subject to microfiltration. Pretreatment by CaCl2 
resulted in higher permeate flux, and moderate flux decline, while pretreatment by 
MgCl2 resulted in significant membrane fouling. Increasing transmembrane pressure 
(TMP) could induce higher initial flux and steady flux. Crossflow velocity did not show 
significant effect on the permeate flux. The potential reuse of treated effluent is 
assessed as well.

bentonite/cement grouting and cement/metasilicate grouting. Chemical grouting agents 
sometimes may leak and lead to relatively large local releases of chemicals into the 
(aquatic) environment [5].  
Tunnel construction may encounter some serious environmental issues when it is 
located in environmentally sensitive areas. For example, the 13-kilometer Hsuehshan 
tunnel, longest in Asia that links Taipei and Taiwan’s northeastern rural Ilan County, 
passes through the vast protected watershed which is reserved for public water supply. 
Impacts on water quality from the huge amount of seepage and discharge of 
wastewater during construction were major concerns then. Conventional 
coagulation-flocculation and sedimentation process is widely used in Taiwan to treat 
the tunnel construction wastewater that contains high suspended solids and soluble 
silicates, and its efficiency may not be satisfactory at times. Besides, water 
conservation through wastewater reclamation and reuse should be actively pursued in 
the construction industry. One of the examples includes recycling highly alkaline 
wastewater in the concrete batching that contains significant amounts of fine cement 
and sand [6]. It is important to develop new treatment technologies to remove 
suspended solids and silica from tunnel construction wastewater, and to seek 
possibility for on-site water reuse. The study aimed at characterization of tunnel 
construction wastewater, evaluation of treatment efficiency of chemical reaction, and 
 
28 
plastic container full of 25 L water. After stirring for 3 minutes, the suspension was let 
to settle for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was decanted and sampled for 
experiments. Soluble silica was analyzed by the molybdosilicate method using sodium 
silicate (Na2SiO3, Acros) in preparing stock solution and calibration curve [7]. The pH 
value of wastewater was 11.14±0.08 and the turbidity was 118±25 NTU as measured 
by a turbidity meter (Orbeco-Hellige 956-10). The soluble silica was 1.41±0.2 g/L. 
Total solid (TS) concentration was 5.83±0.65 g/L, and total suspended solid (TSS) 
concentration was 2.53±0.36 g/L. Particles size ranged from 10 to 1,000μm with 
median size of 179.2μm as analyzed by a light scattering instrument (Malvern, 
Mastersizer 2000). Zeta potential was measured by a zeta meter (Malvern, Zetamaster), 
and showed that particles are negatively charged with zeta potential  of –34.9 ± 1.7 
mV. The wastewater is characterized as very high in soluble silicate, TS, and TSS 
concentrations.  
Total of 1,000 ml of wastewater was used for each experiment in which 
measured amount of CaCl2 or MgCl2 was added. It was stirred in jar test apparatus 
(Philips and Bird, PB-700) at 100 rpm for 3 minutes and 45 rpm for 15 minutes. 
Sodium hydroxide (1 M) and nitric acid (1 M) was used for pH adjustment. It was then 
allowed to settle for 30 min before the supernatant was sampled for analysis of residual 
soluble silica, turbidity, and conductivity. Wastewater pretreated with CaCl2 or MgCl2

where J is the permeate flux at temperature T (m3/m2s), A the area of membrane (m2), 
V the volume of filtration (m3), t the time (s), △P TMP (Pa), μ viscosity of water at 
temperature T (Pa‧s), and Rt total resistance or hydraulic resistance (m-1). Total 
resistance consists of some resistances [9]: 
Rt = Rm + Rf + Rc                                                                 (Eq. 
2) 
where Rm : membrane resistance (m
-1), 
  Rf : fouling resistance (m
-1), 
  Rc : cake resistance (m
-1). 
First, the pure water flow through the membrane filter module was conducted for 30 
minutes under a given filtration pressure and crossflow velocity, and the membrane 
resistance (Rm) could be calculated from the pure water flux. The pure water flow was 
switched to the wastewater sample with the identical operation condition for 20 
minutes. Thus, the total resistance (Rt) could be calculated from the measured flux. As 
soon as the filtration of wastewater was terminated, it was switched instantaneously to 
pure water and the cake layer would be swept away. The filtration of pure water was

Ca2+ + 2OH- = Ca(OH)2     (Eq. 5) 
The introduction of sodium metasilicate to the cement system resulted in very high 
concentration of soluble silica (1.41±0.2 g/L) in the synthetic construction wastewater. 
Although the reactions were complicated, the first step for the removal of silica could 
be described as the increased rate of polymerization of silica when at high initial 
concentration and the addition of CaCl2 [11]. The precipitation of silicates then 
proceeds from polymerization by dehydration accompanied by crosslinking reactions 
and aggregation that eventually leads to soft then hard gels. When at suitably high pH, 
Ca(OH)2 participates in the copolymerization and results in the formation of complex 
hydrous silicate structures [12]. The higher soluble silica concentration at alkaline 
condition can be explained as the hydrolysis of silica, resulting in the formation of 
silicic acid and silicates into the solution [13-14]. Zeta potential of suspended solids in 
the wastewater showed negative values and decreased as pH increased. It was in 
agreement with literature that C-S-H is negatively charged [10]. The effect of CaCl2 
dosage was then examined at pH 8.0 (Table 2). It was found that residual soluble silica 
concentration changed insignificantly with respect to CaCl2 dosage. It has been 
indicated that increasing calcium concentration can accelerate reaction rate of 
polymerization of silica and cannot change the meta-stability of the solution [11]. Zeta

The silicate ions are attracted to Mg(OH)2 via electrostatic interaction. It is difficult to 
differentiate chemical reactions from adsorption, as both may contribute to silica 
removal. It has been indicated that precipitation of Mg(OH)2 has assisted the removal 
of silica, mainly through adsorption, from RO brackish water with high magnesium 
[17]. It was confirmed that MgCl2 was more effective than CaCl2 in removing soluble 
silica from wastewater. 
 
Chemical reaction and microfiltration 
Effects of CaCl2 dosage on microfiltration of wastewater were examined at pH 
8.0, TMP of 0.21 bar, and crossflow velocity of 0.46 m/s (Fig. 2). Significant flux 
increase was observed when wastewater was treated with CaCl2. Initial flux was 1,275, 
1,398, and 1,293 L/m2h for CaCl2 dosage of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 mg/L, respectively. 
Flux then declined gradually in the first 5 min, and stabilized after 10 min. Steady flux 
was 1,066, 1,210, and 1,000 L/m2h for CaCl2 dosage of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 mg/L, 
respectively. It is noted that flux was all very high when wastewater was pretreated 
with CaCl2. Highest steady flux was found when CaCl2 dosage was 2,000 mg/L, 
followed by that of CaCl2 dosage of 1,000 mg/L. For comparison, the original 
construction wastewater without CaCl2 pretreatment showed initial flux of 50 L/m
2h 
and declined to steady flux of 10 L/m2h. The serious fouling could be due to formation 
 
36 
decline under high TMP was not observed in current study [20-21]. Effects of 
crossflow velocity on flux were also examined at operation pressure of 0.21 bar (Fig. 
4). Even though initial flux became higher as crossflow velocity increased, only slightly 
higher steady flux (1,250 L/m2h) was found at crossflow velocity of 0.56 m/s. The 
steady flux at the two lower crossflow velocities was approximately equal (1,210 
L/m2h). This is different from literature that flux increases with increasing crossflow 
velocity.  
Flux as affected by MgCl2 dose at TMP of 0.21 bar and crossflow velocity of 
0.46m/s are shown in Fig. 5. Initial flux of higher than 1,000 L/m2h was found for 
three different MgCl2 doses. However, contrary to systems dosed with CaCl2, rapid 
flux decline to less than half of initial values was observed for the first 3 min regardless 
of MgCl2 dose. Steady flux was 220, 230, and 225 L/m
2h for MgCl2 dosage of 1,000, 
2,000 and 3,000 mg/L, respectively. The specific resistances, including Rm, Rf, and Rc, 
derived from MF of wastewater are depicted in Table 6. It shows that resistance could 
be reduced by the addition of MgCl2, though not as significant as that of CaCl2. Cake 
resistance was the main one causing flux decline. Resistance by fouling was significant 
when MgCl2 dose was 1,000 mg/L, it then became negligible as MgCl2 dosage became 
higher. The total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentration of 
wastewater dosed with MgCl2 was not higher than those dosed with CaCl2. Therefore, 
 
38 
noted that the permeate contained significant concentration of chloride since certain 
amounts of CaCl2 and MgCl2 were used in removing silica. It may be possibly reused in 
making grouting system as long as the effects of chloride and silica are assessed. The 
maximum allowable level of chloride for mixing water of concrete is 250 mg/L 
according to the National Standard of Taiwan (CNS), while the limit is 500 mg/L in 
American Standard (ASTM) [6]. The permeate has to mix and dilute with other water 
before it can be used in concrete. It can possibly be reused in machine wash and truck 
wash, toilet, and others. Of course, it can also be polished by ion exchange unit to 
remove chloride and silica for better water quality and reuse. Compared with chemical 
reaction, MF followed by chemical reaction has some advantages, such as small 
footprint, better effluent quality, and more flexible operation. However, better 
strategies to prevent membrane fouling need to be investigated in the future. 
  
 
Conclusions 
The removal of suspended solids and soluble silica in tunnel construction 
wastewater by chemical reaction and chemical reaction followed by microfiltration was 
investigated in this study. Major findings of the study can be summarized as:
