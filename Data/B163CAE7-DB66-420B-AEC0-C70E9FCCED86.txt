Fig. 1 Simplified schematic of the half bridge forward/flyback
converter
To proceed, the operational analysis of the asymmetrical half
bridge forward/flyback converter can be explained as follows.
Mode 1 (to~t1): At to , Q1 is on and Q2 is off. The output diode Do
is reversely biased. Components Cb, Lm and Lk form a series
resonant tank with voltage source Vin providing the input energy.
Since the length of time interval (t1-to) is short compared with the
time constant of the resonant tank, the power source Vin charges Cb,
Lm and Lk in a linear fashion. The leakage and magnetizing currents
start to decrease from zero. The circuit governing equations are:
Cin

This mode ends when Q1 turns off.
Mode 2 (t1~t2): At t1, Q1 is turned off and Q2 remains off. The
components Cb, Lm, Lkand Cds1 form a new series resonant network,
and Cb, Lm, Lk and Cds2 form another series resonant network. The
power source Vin charges Cds1 and Cb with half of the magnetizing
current. The other half of the magnetizing current charges Cb
through discharging Cds2. The circuit governing equations are:

By assuming a linear magnetizing current, the voltage vds1 starts to
increases from zero in a quadratic fashion. This mode ends when
vds1 reaches to the value of (Vin + Vfd) and the body diode of Q2 starts
to conduct. The notation Vfdstands for diode forward voltage drop.

(2) Average voltage across blocking capacitor
The average voltage VC across the blocking capacitor is
proportional to the duty ratio D. The relationship can be
obtained from solving (21) and (22) simultaneously:
inC DVV  (24)
Equation (23) and (24) reveal that, depends on Vin and Vo,
the value of duty ratio D can be larger or less than 0.5. For
fixed Vin , the smaller the Vo, the shorter the duty ratio.

where
muIˆ is the upper peak current of magnetizing inductor.
(4) Average load current
The output diode current iDo(t) is determined by the turns
ratio n of Tr and the difference between the resonant current
iLk and the magnetizing current iLm. The average load current
Io can be obtained as follows:

(5) Resonant frequency
During the time interval
ss TtDT  , the resonant current
iLk(t) is a sinusoidal function and the magnetizing current iLm(t)
increases linearly. The difference between the resonant
current and the magnetizing current generates the output
diode current. Under full load condition, the output diode can
turn off with ZCS only if the following criterion is satisfied:

Since parameter d is a function ofω, (36) is highly nonlinear
inω. Analytically, it is difficult to solve (36) for ω. To find
the resonant frequency, the following empirical formula can
be used:
sTD)1( 
  (37)
Satisfaction of (37) means that the resonant current will
continue to develop for at least half of its resonant period
during the time interval 0~(1–D)Ts in order to have ZCS turn
off for the output diode. It is also noted that once the output
diode turns off with ZCS under full load condition, the ZCS
will continue to effect for light load because satisfaction of
criterion (33) is guaranteed.
(6) ZVS conditions
The ZVS operation of power switches in the studied
converter depends on the magnitude of magnetizing current.
6 shows the key waveforms measured from the prototype
converter under full load condition. The resonant inductor
current iLk(t) and the output diode current ido(t) in Fig. 6 are in
good agreement with the theoretical and simulation analysis
in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, respectively. The ZVS operations of Q1
and Q2 can be observed from zero to full load, as indicated in
the waveforms shown in Fig. 7. The prototype converter
constructed for experimental measurement is shown in Fig. 8.
