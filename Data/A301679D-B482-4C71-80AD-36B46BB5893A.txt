Abstract- Novel blind and semi-blind subspace channel estimations are proposed for multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of 
virtual carriers (VC). Slow convergence rate is a drawback of subspace method in deriving the noise/signal 
subspaces from the second-order statistics of received signals, especially when the dimension of received 
signals is large.  In this paper, the block matrix scheme is proposed to generate a group of sub-vectors from 
each OFDM symbols. The dimension of sub-vectors is reduced and the number of equivalent signals is 
increased, and therefore, the convergence rate of channel estimation is enhanced. The semi-blind method is 
also developed by incorporating the subspace technology with pilot information. The identifiability of the 
block matrix scheme-based channel estimation is presented at the end. Computer simulations show that the 
proposed blind and semi-blind methods converge very well in channel estimation and equalization.

I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of key promising techniques for future 
broadband wireless networks [1].  For example, OFDM systems are adopted in digital audio broadcasting 
(DAB) [2], digital video broadcasting (DVB) [3] and broadband wireless access standard (IEEE 802.16) [4].  
Besides, the Long Term Evolution (LET)-advanced, as a candidate of the fourth-generation (4G) system, 
proposes the OFDM system with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques to achieve the minimum 
peak data rate and spectral efficiency requirements [5][6]. In high-speed wireless communication systems the 
multipath propagation often causes serious inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects. The ISI effect is alleviated 
in OFDM systems by applying guard intervals such as cyclic prefix (CP) and zero-padding (ZP) to each 
OFDM symbol. Besides, for shaping the transmission spectrum and alleviating the adjacent channel 
interference (ACI), the virtual carriers (VC), in which zero values are sent, are properly distributed on the 
dedicated band [7]. 
Channel estimation and equalization are necessarily performed prior to the receiver detection in 
communication systems.  Training-based method is the most popular technique for its low complexity and 
high stability.  However, extra bandwidth is required to accommodate the periodic training symbols and thus 
reduces the spectrum efficiency [8][9].  The blind method utilizes the second-order or higher statistics of 
received signals to perform the channel estimation [10][11].  The inherent ambiguity problem in blind 
method can be corrected by using few pilot sequences. On the other hand, semi-blind techniques [12][13] 
integrate both statistics information and pilot sequences to resolve the channel estimation and ambiguity 
problem simultaneously. Regarding the peak-to-average power ratio problem, a semi-blind channel estimation 
using preamble-based multi-channel separation design for MIMO-OFDM system is presented in [14]. The 
semi-blind inter-carrier interference equalization is discussed in [15] by using the fourth-order cumulants with 
the joint multiple matrix diagonalization algorithm.
Considering the usage of VCs, the channel estimation has been studied in a variety of OFDM systems 
[16]-[19]. Li and Roy [16] presented a subspace blind channel estimation for single-input single-output (SISO) 
OFDM systems. Shin et al. proposed a subspace channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems in [17]. Cui 
and Tellambura [18] discussed the joint carrier frequency offset and channel estimation for OFDM systems by 
using pilot sequences and VCs. Huang et al. [19] examined the semi-blind subspace channel estimation in 
uplink OFDMA systems.
In this paper, the blind and semi-blind subspace channel estimations are examined for MIMO CP-OFDM 
systems with virtual carriers. The blind and semi-blind subspace methods in general converge slowly and 
require a huge amount of received symbols to obtain accurate statistics and low channel estimation errors. To 
improve the convergence of subspace channel estimation, Yu [20] proposed the block matrix scheme (BMS) 
for SIMO CP-free OFDM systems.  This approach obtains a group of equivalent signals by segmenting each 
OFDM symbol into sub-vectors.  Exploiting the idea, the BMS technique is extended here to blind and 
semi-blind subspace channel estimations in MIMO OFDM systems with VCs. The identifiability of the 
proposed channel estimation is discussed, which obtains a rule of thumb of selecting the parameter of the 
block matrix scheme. The computational complexity of the compared channel estimations are evaluated at the 
end.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the signal model of the MIMO 
CP-OFDM systems with VCs. The blind channel estimation based on the block matrix scheme is proposed in

To perform the subspace channel estimation, channel matrix HQ-L is assumed to be tall and skinny, which is 
achieved by deploying Mr > Mt. If the deployment is not possible, the oversampling technique can be used 
instead. Based on the signal vector rn, the subspace channel estimation will be discussed in the next section.
III. BLIND SUBSPACE CHANNEL ESTIMATION
Based on the signal vector rn, we propose a fast subspace channel estimation for MIMO OFDM with VC as 
follows. To easily conduct, the conventional channel estimation presented in [17] is first briefly reviewed.

Substituting (9) into (6), rn becomes 
 n Q L CP Mt n n n n     r H W I s v s v                (11)
where  Q L CP Mt Ξ H W I is a ( )r tM Q L M D  matrix. Based on (11), the channel can be identified by the 
subspace method if Ξ is of full column rank, The condition for this full column rank requirement is given in 
Theorem 1 of  [17]
Theorem 1: In the case of Mr > Mt and L ≤ Q-D, the matrix Ξ have a full column rank if and only if

deviate from its normal value and result in the invalidation in (24). In this case, the constrained least square

V. IDENTIFIABILITY OF THE CHANNEL ESTIMATION
The identifiability of the subspace channel estimation in (23) is discussed in this section. We first establish 
the condition that HG is of full column rank in the following theorem. 
Theorem 2: Let H(z) be irreducible and column reduced with assumption of 
rank(h(0))=rank(h(L))=rank(H(z))=Mt for all z. Then the submatrix HG has a full column rank if Mr >Mt and 
G>MtL. 
The proof of Theorem 2 can be derived from [17][24]. From  Theorem 2, we obtain the range of G in 
which HG has a full column rank by MtL<G≦Q-L, where the sub-vector rn,g in (13) degenerates to rn in (6) 
when G meets the upper bound Q-L. We further divide this set into two parts, D-L≦G≦Q-L and MtL<G<D-L.
When D-L≦G≦Q-L, 0W is a tall matrix and has full column rank due to the Vandermonde matrix property 
[25]. With above results, we have the identifiability conditions of the proposed channel estimation as follows.
Theorem 3: Let GH be the matrix constructed from h with the same manner as the matrix GH from h. 
In the case of Mr >Mt, L(D-1)/(Mt+1), and D-L≦G≦Q-L, assuming that h(0), h(L) and H(z) for all z are all 
of full column rank, then  h hΩ where Ω is a MtMt nonsingular matrix if and only if h has full column 
rank and 0 0( ) ( )G Grange range H W H W .
Proof: This result had been revealed in Lemma 1 of [17]. We provide a detailed proof for the proposed 
method here. Based on Theorem 2 and the Vandermonde matrix property [25], both HG and 0W are full 
column rank matrix if G≧D-L. Then, 0GH W is of full column rank. Now we define some notations as 
follows:
Theorem 4: Let GH be the matrix constructed from h with the same manner as the matrix GH from h. 
In the case of Mr >Mt and MtL<G<D-L, assuming that h(0), h(L) and H(z) for all z are all of full column rank, 
then  h hΩ where Ω is a MtMt nonsingular matrix if and only if h has full column rank and 
( ) ( )G Grange range H H .
Proof: The proof of Theorem 4 is trivia since if 0 0( ) ( )G Grange range H W H W , it turns out that 
( ) ( )G GRange Range H H . Consequently, using the result of Theorem 2 in [24], the identifiability condition is 
then achieved accordingly. 
VI. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
The computational complexity of the compared channel estimations are examined in terms of the number of 
complex multiplication (CM) in this section. Let , , ,
H
n g n g n gR r r . We find from (13) that , 1n gR can partly 
derive from ,n gR . The computations of ,0nR requires 
2 2
rG M CMS while that of ,n gR requires additional 
2
rGM CMs for g1. Then the calculation of GRˆ involves about 2( ) rK Q L GM CMs. Finding the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors of GRˆ needs 
3 36 rG M CMs. Computing Φ requires  ( ) ( 1) [( ) ( 1)]r r rGM d M L D G L M L    
CMs. Finally, the estimate of h in (28) calls for 3 36 ( 1)rM L  CMs. Assuming that 1Q L  and G L
then the total number of CMs of the proposed channel estimation is about
2 3 36 ( ) ( )BMS r r r r rCM KQGM G M GM d M DL G M L     (50)
As for the method in [17], the total amount of CMs is about
2 2 3 36 ( ) ( )Shin r r r t r rCM KQ M Q M QM DM M QL Q M L     (51)
Compared with (50) and (51), the proposed channel estimation has a smaller number of CMs than that in [17] 
for G<Q-L.
The complexity of the proposed semi-blind method is further discussed. We ignore the computations for 
IDFT operation and the permutation operation Pv. The cost to obtain HMt MtQ Q is the same number of CMs as in 
(50). The calculation of HMr MrD D requires 
2 2( 1)tABM L  CMs. The inverse in (40) and HMr vD y need about 
3 3 36 ( 1)r tM M L  and ( 1)r tABM M L  CMs, respectively. Finally, the estimate of h from (40) requires 
2 2 2( 1)r tM M L  CMs. Therefore, the total amount of CMs for the semi-blind method is about
2 2 3 3 3( ) 6Semi BMS t r t r tCM CM AB M L M M L M M L         (52)
The computational complexity of the semi-blind method is higher than the blind method. However, the 
former will get much better performance than the latter as shown in the next section.
VII. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
In this section, various simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed blind/semi-blind subspace 
channel estimations. The number of subcarriers is set N=64, number of CP=16 and number of VC=8. The 
16QAM modulation scheme is applied. The input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as the bit SNR at 
single receive antenna. The channel impulse response is modeled as a wide-sense stationary uncorrelated 
scattering process of channel order L=5 in which the channel coefficients are assumed to be independent 
identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance. In the semi-blind approach, 
we use A=1, B=16. The weighting factor is set 50  without using the optimum value in (41) for simplicity. 
The normalized root mean-squared error (NRMSE) between the estimated and true channels is given by

II. SYSTEM MODEL

Transmitted symbol bq(n,k) is assumed to be independent

with zero-mean and variance 2s . After multicarrier

and temporally white, and be uncorrelated with transmitted

Note that HN is a NMr(N+L)Mt block Toeplitz matrix. 
To consider a tall and skinny matrix for HN, we assume that 
Mr>Mt. If it is not the case, the fractionally spaced receiver 
could be used here. In (2), we assume the channel order is 
known a priori derived from Akaike information theoretic 
criterion (AIC) or minimum description length (MDL) [15]. 
Based on the signal model in (2), we discuss the subspace 
channel estimation in the next section. 
III. SUBSPACE CHANNEL ESTIMATION 
With the signal model in (2), various subspace channel 
estimation techniques have been presented based on 
different assumptions. We briefly describe the channel 
estimation in [12] for the purpose of comparison. Let WN 
=[w(0) … w(N-1)] and define WCP and WCP,Mt respectively 
by

the channel is identifiable if the matrix HW is of full column 
rank. A necessary and sufficient condition for this full 
column rank requirement is given in [12], which is stated as 
follows. 
Theorem 1 [12]: In the case of Mr >Mt, the matrix HW is 
of full column rank if and only if rank(H(z))=Mt at

From Theorem 2, we can calculate the signal and noise

the correlation matrix of rn is first computed by

A theorem is given in [17] that (15) can determine the 
channel matrix h up to an ambiguity matrix. 
Theorem 3 [17]: Let h  be a matrix that has the same 
size as that of h, GH  be constructed from h  in the same 
form as HG is constructed from h. Assume that h(0), h(L) 
and H(z) have a full column rank for all z, and G is no less 
than the degree of orthogonal complement polynomial 
matrix of H(z). Then h  is equal to hΩ where Ω is an Mt 
Mt invertible matrix if and only if h  has a full column 
rank and span ( )GH  is equal to span(HG).  
In a finite sample scenario, we use the sample 
correlation matrix ˆ GR  instead of the ensemble average 
correlation matrix RG to compute the noise subspace. Due to 
the biasness of the sample correlation matrix, the 
homogeneous equations in (15) will not be satisfied. The 
constrained least square optimization criterion is adopted to 
find the channel matrix

are the eigenvectors associated with the Mt smallest 
eigenvalues of the matrix QQH. From Theorem 3, hˆ  differs 
from h by an ambiguity matrix Ω. In the blind channel 
estimation, the assistance of pilot sequences is a practical 
way to solve the ambiguity and alleviate the phase rotation 
in the symbol detection.  
 
B. Semi-blind Approach 
The semi-blind estimation technique estimates the 
channels by combining the blind method with the pilot 
information [18]. From (2), rn can be rewritten as  
n cir n n r H s v  
where Hcir is a NMr×NMt block circular matrix, and

Abstract- Novel blind and semi-blind subspace channel 
estimations are proposed for multiple-input multiple-output 
(MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) 
systems in the presence of virtual carriers (VC). Slow convergence 
rate is a drawback of subspace method in deriving the noise/signal 
subspaces from the second-order statistics of received signals, 
especially when the dimension of received signals is large.  In this 
paper, the block matrix scheme is proposed to generate a group of 
sub-vectors from each OFDM symbols. The dimension of sub-
vectors is reduced and the number of equivalent signals is 
increased, and therefore, the convergence rate of channel 
estimation is enhanced. The semi-blind method is also developed 
by incorporating the subspace technology with pilot information. 
Computer simulations show that the proposed blind and semi-
blind methods converge very well in channel estimation and 
equalization.  
Keywords: MIMO; OFDM; virtual carrier; subspace channel 
estimation; Toeplitz 
I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with 
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique plays an 
important role in the future fourth-generation (4G) 
communication systems [1][2].  For example, OFDM systems 
are adopted in digital audio broadcasting (DAB) [3], digital 
video broadcasting (DVB) [4] and broadband wireless access 
standard (IEEE 802.16) [5].  In OFDM systems, guard 
intervals such as cyclic prefix (CP) and zero-padding (ZP) are 
used for combating the inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects.  
Besides, for shaping the transmission spectrum and alleviating 
the adjacent channel interference (ACI), the virtual carriers 
(VC), in which zero values are sent, are properly distributed on 
the dedicated band [6]. Channel estimation is necessarily 
performed prior to the receiver detection in communication 
systems.  Training-based method is the most popular technique 
for its low complexity and high stability.  However, extra 
bandwidth is required to accommodate the periodic training 
symbols and thus reduces the spectrum efficiency [7][8].  The 
blind method utilizes the second-order or higher statistics of 
received signals to perform the channel estimation [9][10].  
The ambiguity problem in blind method can be corrected by 
using few pilot sequences. On the other hand, semi-blind 
techniques [11][12] integrate both statistics information and

pilot sequences to resolve the channel estimation and 
ambiguity problem simultaneously.   
Considering the usage of VCs, the channel estimation has 
been studied in a variety of OFDM systems [13]-[16]. Li and 
Roy presented a subspace blind channel estimation for single-
input single-output (SISO) OFDM systems [13]. Shin et al. 
proposed a subspace channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM 
systems in [14]. [15] discussed the joint carrier frequency 
offset and channel estimation for OFDM systems by using 
pilot sequences and VCs. [16] examined the semi-blind 
subspace channel estimation in uplink OFDMA systems. 
In this paper, the blind and semi-blind subspace channel 
estimations are examined for MIMO CP-OFDM systems with 
virtual carriers. The blind and semi-blind subspace methods in 
general converge slowly and require a huge amount of received 
symbols to obtain accurate statistics and low channel 
estimation errors. To improve the convergence of subspace 
channel estimation, [17] proposed the block matrix scheme 
(BMS) for SIMO CP-free OFDM systems.  This approach 
obtains a group of equivalent signals by segmenting each 
OFDM symbol into sub-vectors.  Exploiting the idea, the BMS 
technique is applied to blind and semi-blind subspace channel 
estimation in MIMO OFDM systems with VCs.  The computer 
simulations are given at the end to show the superiority of the 
proposed blind/semi-blind subspace channel estimation.

B. Propose blind Subspace Channel Estimation  
The estimation performance is relevant to the biasness of the 
sample correlation matrix. Let  rr r  	R R R be the bias 
matrix of the sample correlation matrix. The norm of the bias 
matrix, r FR , is proportional to the size of rn and inversely 
proportion to K [19]. To obtain a lower channel estimation 
error, the demands for a low r FR  or a high K is stringent. 
The requirement for K becomes dramatically higher if the 
DFT-size N is getting larger. Inspired by the block matrix 
scheme in [17], a novel subspace channel estimation is 
proposed with fast convergence speed in this subsection. We 
first define a set of sub-vectors ,{ }n gr  from rn.

The solutions of (17) are the eigenvectors associated with the 
Mt smallest eigenvalues of matrixӥ. h  differs from the true 
channel h on an ambiguity matrix  ˁ In blind subspace 
method, the usage of few pilot sequences is a feasible way to 
solve the ambiguity problem.  
IV. SEMI-BLIND CHANNEL ESTIMATION 
Few pilot sequences are used to correct the ambiguity 
problem followed by the subspace channel estimation. 
However, it doesn’t increase the estimation performance in the 412
in Fig. 2. With the selection of simulation parameters described 
above, the number of equivalent symbols by the block matrix 
scheme is 36 for each OFDM symbol. It is obvious that the 
proposed blind method outperforms the blind one in [14]. In 
cooperating with the pilot sequences, the developed semi-blind 
method could obtain better performance than the blind method. 
The NRMSE versus the number of OFDM symbols is plotted 
in Fig. 3. The proposed blind/semi-blind methods converge 
faster than the Shin’s method. The convergence property is 
especially evident when N is large. In this case, the method in 
[14] requires much more OFDM symbols to converge 
according to the analysis results in [19]. On the other hand, the 
proposed methods reduce the dimension of sub-vectors and 
gain more equivalent symbols by block matrix scheme, which 
causes a faster convergence in channel estimation. The 
simulations for N larger than 64 are not shown here for the 
space limitation. Fig. 4 shows the NRMSE versus the size of 
block matrix, which is ranged from 11 to 75. When G is near 
the minimum, the dimension of noise subspace is small such 
that the estimation error increases. On the other hand, when G 
is close to the maximum, the number of equivalent symbols is 
reduced and thus the performance approaches to that in [14]. 
Observed from this plot, the performance is not sensitive to G
when G is in the vicinity of the midpoint. 
Example 2: We also show the bit error rate (BER) of zero-
forcing (ZF) equalizers with the estimated channel coefficients. 
From (8), the ZF equalizer is computed by 
ˆ( ( ))ZF Q L CP Mt

	 W H W I  and the output of equalizer is 
given by ˆn ZF ns W r . In this example, we show the BERs of 
the ZF equalizer with the estimated channels computed in 
Example 1. For comparison, the BER computed by using the 
true channels is also plotted. Fig. 5 shows the BER versus the 
input SNR. The proposed method has a lower BER than Shin’s 
method. Besides, the semi-blind method almost has the same 
performance as that by using the true channels. The BER 
versus the number of OFDM symbols is plotted in Fig. 6. The 
semi-blind method converges to the ideal BER within about 40 
OFDM symbols. Finally, Fig. 7 shows the BER versus the size 
of block matrix. Except for the both ends, the blind and semi-
blind methods are not sensitive to the selection of G.  
VI. CONCLUSIONS
The blind and semi-blind subspace channel estimations are 
presented in this paper for MIMO-OFDM systems with virtual 
carriers. A group of sub-vectors are generated from each 
OFDM symbol by the block matrix scheme. With the 
equivalent signals, the biasness of the correlation matrix is 
reduced and the performance of the blind subspace channel 
estimation is enhanced. Besides, incorporating the subspace 
method with few pilot sequences, the semi-blind method is 
investigated. The proposed methods are especially useful when 
N is large. Computer simulations confirm the superiority of the 
proposed blind and semi-blind channel estimation.
