n-channel TFTs were fabricated on micro-lens array induced location controlled lateral grains
in excimer laser annealing (ELA), with using sputtering deposition method for both Si active
layer and SiO2 gate insulator. The TFTs have the best electron field effect mobility of 160
cm2/V-s when the Si film is in slightly completely melting regime in ELA process, with on/off
ratio of 105 and S value of 1.2 V.
INTRODUCTION
Rapid melting and recrystallization by
excimer laser annealing (ELA) of amorphous
silicon (a-Si) thin films have been applied to
the production of low-temperature
polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) for thin-film
transistors (TFTs)1. These TFTs construct
not only pixel switches, but also peripheral
driver circuits for active-matrix flat-panel
displays. Their future evolution aims at the
enlargement of the matrix/circuit scale and
further system integration into the panel,
which require both the enhancement of the
TFT performance and device-to-device
uniformity. The ultimate TFT is the single
grain TFTs where the channel of a TFT was
formed within a single grain. Several
methods for 2D grain control have been
proposed in ELA of Si thin-films, μ-Cz2,
phase modulated ELA (PMELA)3, 2D
sequential lateral solidification (2D-SLS)4,
and TFTs with mobility of as high as above
300 cm2/V-s have been fabricated in these
method.
We have proposed micro-lens array
induced location controlled lateral grains,
and as a result, the super lateral grains (SLG)
with a diameter of ~10 µm were formed with
a period of 10 µm5,6. In this study, TFTs
were fabricated with their channel region
formed within a location controlled grain.
Besides, it is worth to say that both the Si
active layer and SiO2 gate insulator were
formed by sputtering deposition method7,8,
and the laser annealing method was used to
activate the impurities9.
Experiment
a. Crystalline methods
The sample structure was Si(90
nm)/SiO2(100 nm)/SiOxNy(800 nm)/Non
alkali glass in which SiOxNy film work as
light absorptive underlayer for increasing the
grain size10. Here the Si film was deposited
at 250 0C by DC magnetron sputtering
deposition method using 105 Ω-cm n-type
Fz-Si wafer as the sputtering target. The Si
film was then crystallized by ELA method
with applying micro-lens array induced grain
location control method5.
b. Gate insulators
The gate SiO2 layer was deposited by
pulsed-DC reactive magnetron sputtering at
room temperature. High quality Si target was
used and the atmosphere in the chamber was
argon mixed with oxygen. The ratio of oxygen
to total gas (4 sccm) was set as 0.5 and the
sputter-deposited gas pressure was 5 mTorr.
The power Density was 1.1 W/cm2 and the
TON/TOFF was 5 µs/ 15µs. The MOS capacitor
was then annealed at 450 0C in forming gas
atmosphere (N2 95%, H2 5%) for 10 min in
order to improve the interface state between
the Si and SiO2.
c. TFT fabrications
After micro-lens array induced location
controlled lateral grains with a diameter of 10
µm. The succeeding TFT fabrication process
is as following. Si islands were fabricated by
photolithography and successive reactive ion
etching (RIE). Then 140 nm-thick SiO2 as
gate insulator was formed by pulsed-DC
reactive sputtering method. The substrate was
not heated during film deposition. Then Al
film was deposited by thermal evaporation at
room temperature, and was then patterned into
gate pattern. Phosphorous was implanted into
Si film with a dosage of 5×1015 cm-2 and with
an implanting energy of 137 keV. The
impurity was then activated by room
ratio is 105, and S value is 1.2V. The sheet
resistance of Si film at S/D region is 1500
Ω/sq, which limited the mobility and on
current. Besides, lightly doped n type Si (5-10
Ω-cm) film was used in channel region, which
result in higher off current. TFT
characteristics will be further improved by
optimization of fabrication processes. In the
TFTs fabricated on Si films with either highly
completely melting regime or partially
melting regime, the mobility is decreased,
probably due to decreasing of grain sizes. In
addition, the grains in these regimes are
randomly located.

Conclusions
n-channel TFTs were fabricated on
micro-lens array induced location controlled
lateral grains, with using DC sputtering to
form Si films for active layer and using
pulsed-DC reactive sputtering to deposit SiO2
films for gate insulator. The Si film in slightly
completely melting regime results in the best
TFT performance. The electron field effect
mobility of as high as 160 cm2/V-s has been
obtained, with the on/off ratio of 105, S value
of 1.2V. Further improvement can be expected
by decreasing sheet resistant of S/D region, by
using lightly doped p type Si channel region,
and by decreasing interface trap density
between Si and SiO2.
