1. Abstract
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 thin films
were prepared by rf magnetron sputtering. All
of the films were deposited at a fixed substrate
temperature of 250oC, an operating pressure of
5 mTorr, a mixture of argon and oxygen at a
fixed flow-rate ratio of 100/0 and annealing
temperature of 700oC for 30 min. The
deposition time was fixed at 5 min with
different RF power (250W~450W). We have
investigated the dependence of the
microstructure and dielectric properties as a
function of RF power. At rf power level of
350W, substrate temperature of 250C and
annealing temperature of 700oC, the
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 films with 63 nm
thickness possesses a dielectric constant of 21.6
and a leakage current density of 3×10-8A/cm2 at
the electrical field of 50 kV/cm.

2. Introduction
Several types of dielectric materials have
been developed and investigated to meet the
requirements of high tech applications in recent
years. It is well known that dielectric
materials are being utilized for filters, for
stabilization of the frequency of oscillation in
microwave integrated circuits and for
increasing the storage capacitance density in
DRAMs. Those materials suitable for
applications should have predictable properties
with respect to dielectric constant, loss quality
and temperature coefficient of resonant
frequency. Various complex perovskites
ceramics A(B1/2B1/2)O3 (A = Me+2, Me+3；B=
Me+2, Me+3；B= Me+4, Me+5, Me+6) have also
been reported due to their excellent microwave
dielectric properties [1-6]. Among these,
Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Nd, Dy, Y)
ceramic, has been widely used as substrate in
superconducting microwave devices since it has
a high quality factor, excellent lattice matching
and favorable matching for thermal expansion
[5-7].
Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions whose
measured quality factor (Q×f) exceeded 30000
(GHz) and whose dielectric constants are
between 22 and 27 have non-cubic symmetry
and a GdFeO3-type structure [9]. Since
Nd(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 has a dielectric constant ( r)
of 29, a quality factor (Q×f) of 75500 (GHz)
and a temperature coefficient of resonant
frequency (τf) of –65, it is one of the
Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions that has been
determined to be a suitable substrate for
YBa2Cu3OX thin films and resonators used in
microwave applications. Additionally, since
the ionic radius of Co+2 (0.082nm) is similar to
that of Mg+2 (0.078nm), the Mg+2 ion can be
substituted by the ion of Co+2 to form
Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3. It also has suitable and
optimum microwave dielectric properties ( r~
27, Qf ~ 140000 GHz, f ~ –46 ppm/C at a
sintering temperature of 1440oC) for
applications in dielectric resonators [8].
Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 has been playing an
important role in the microwave communication
system because of its excellent dielectric
properties. With the addition of 0.5wt ZnO,
Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 has a dielectric constant of
27.4 and a high Q×f value of 147000 (GHz).
Furthermore, the temperature coefficient of
resonant frequency can be adjusted to -30
ppm/C [9]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern of Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 with or without ZnO
addition were identical, because ZnO ions
remained at the boundary phase as sintering
attributer and quality factor (Q) promoter.
For the next generation of ULSI dynamic
random access memory (DRAM), it is widely
believed that dielectric materials with high

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of ZnO-doped
Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 thin films deposited on
ITO/Glass substrates at a substrate temperature
250C and a annealing temperature of 700oC
for 30 min with rf powers of 250W~ 450W.
As observed from x-ray diffraction pattern, the
peaks of ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 (110),
(111), (200), (021), (022), (202), (220), (221)
and (310) were very distinct. The intensities
were enhanced with increasing rf power, the
intensities of the ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3
peak (200) was relatively higher than the others
due to higher orientation. After reaching the
maximum at rf power of 350W, the peaks of
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 obviously
decreased owing to the higher kinetic energies
that could rapid grain growth and also damage
the microstructure. Besides, the full width at
half maximum intensity values (FWHM) of the
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 (200) peak was
decrease with increasing the rf power.
Fig. 1 X-ray diffraction patterns of the
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 films with various
rf power.
The SEM micrographs of the deposited
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 thin films were
demonstrated in Fig. 2. It was observed that
the grains of the ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3
ceramic films were dense and uniform at the rf
power level of 250W~ 450W. The grain size
of the deposited film increased with increasing
rf power. It was owing to that higher rf power
would increase the energies of the ions that
bombarded the target. The kinetic energy
carried by the atoms sputtered on the substrate
would also be increased resulted in an
enhancement of grain growth.

Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 films deposited with various rf
power ( a ) 250W ( b ) 350W ( c ) 450W.
The influences of the rf power on the surface
morphologies of the film were studied by
atomic force microscopy (Fig. 3). The surface
morphology of the deposited film is related to
the thickness and crystallinity and depends on
the processing parameters such as substrate
temperature, rf power and gas pressure. The
structure zone of evaporated films was modeled
by Movchan and Demehishin (M&D) and
modified by Thornton [12]. The structure zone
models correlating surface morphology with
Ts/Tm (substrate temperature/coating material
melting point) and represent as a function of
Ts/Tm in terms of four zones. Zone 1
(Ts/Tm0.3) in which the voided boundaries in
the film were ascribed to low adatom diffusion
and the structure grows as tapered crystalline
with domed tops. Besides, several holes were
clearly revealed in this zone. As the substrate
temperature (Ts) increased to Zone 2
(0.3Ts/Tm0.7), the adatom mobility was
increased with increasing Ts and consists of
columnar grains with dense arrayed in the
intercrystalline boundaries. Zone T was
identified between the zone 1 and zone 2 and
consists of densely packed fibrous grains
without overly voided boundaries. Zone 3
(Ts/Tm0.7) which the Ts is close to Tm
possesses equiaxial grains with a bright surface.
From Fig. 3, each of the deposited films had
close packed columns and the mean square
roughness (Rms) were decrease with increasing
rf power.
The electrical properties of C-V and I-V
curves of ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 films
were measured by Pt/ ZnO-doped
Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3/ITO/Glass (MIM) structure.
6of the thin films decreased with increasing rf
power. However, as the highest rf power, the
quality of the ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 thin
films was damaged since the kinetic energies of
deposited atoms increased resulting in a
structural destruction. At rf power level of
350W, substrate temperature of 250C and
annealing temperature of 700oC, the
ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 films with 63 nm
thickness possesses a dielectric constant of 21.6
and a leakage current density of 3×10-8A/cm2 at
the electrical field of 50 kV/cm. It seems that
the ZnO-doped Nd(Co1/2Ti1/2)O3 films has ideal
characteristics such as dielectric constant and
leakage current density and it can find
applications in dynamic random access
memories (DRAMs) and wireless
communication system.

Abstract. Electrical and optical properties of 1wt% ZnO-doped (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 thin films prepared
by rf magnetron sputtering on ITO/Glass substrates at different rf power and substrate temperature
have been investigated. The surface structural and morphological characteristics analyzed by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were found to be sensitive to the
deposition conditions, such as rf power and substrate temperature. The selected-area diffraction
pattern showed that the deposited films exhibited a polycrystalline microstructure. All films
exhibited ZST (111) orientation perpendicular to the substrate surface and the grain size as well as
the deposition rate of the film increased with the increase in both the rf power and the substrate
temperature. Optical transmittance spectroscopy further revealed high transparency (over 60%) in
the visible region of the spectrum. The dependence of the physical, electrical and optical
characteristics on various rf power and substrate temperature were also investigated.
Introduction
Zirconium tin titanium oxide was investigated as a potentially useful dielectric material owing
to its excellent dielectric properties, which include high dielectric constant, high quality factor, and
low temperature coefficient of the dielectric resonant frequency in the microwave regime [1-3]. The
base material of (Zr,Sn)TiO4 is ZrTiO4 which has been investigated by McHale and Roth,4
9with Cu Kradiation. The morphology of the film surface was determined using an atomic force
microscope (AFM, Digital Instrument DI3000).
The electrical properties of the ZnO-doped ZST thin films were evaluated by current-voltage
(I–V) measurements. The test samples with metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIM) capacitor
structures were prepared on ITO/Glass (Corning 7059) substrates. The sample devices (Pt/
ZnO-doped ZST/ITO/glass) were fabricated by depositing Pt electrodes (diameter = 0.5 mm) on the
top side of the ZnO-doped ZST/ITO/glass structure. All electrodes were prepared by using ion
sputtering. The I-V curves of the MIM capacitors were measured by using a HP4156 Parameter
Analyzer.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of ZnO-doped ZST thin films deposited on ITO/Glass
substrates at different substrate temperatures and rf powers. As observed from the x-ray diffraction
pattern, the peaks of ZnO-doped ZST (101), (111), (002), (020), (112), (121), (022), (202), (220),
(103) and (113) were very distinct. The intensities increased with increasing rf power and substrate
temperature. As the rf power was increased to 400W and the substrate temperature was increased to
400oC, the intensities of the ZnO-doped ZST peak (111) were relatively higher than the others due
to preferred growth of these grains. Also, the full width at half maximum intensity values (FWHM)
of the ZnO-doped ZST (111) peaks decreased with increasing the rf power. In addition, ITO peaks
such as 2= 36o appeared at low rf power and substrate temperature. With increasing substrate
temperature and rf power at the growing film surface, the kinetic energies and mobilities of the
atoms also increase. The additional energy contributed to finer and uniform grain development in
the films.

Fig. 4 shows the I-V curves of the ZnO-doped ZST films deposited on ITO/Glassi substrate at
different substrate temperatures. The results of measurement were fit with leakage current density
vs. electrical field. The leakage current density decreased with increasing substrate temperature.
The leakage current is influenced by the grain size, crystallinity and surface morphology. The
grain boundary structure is more dense and uniform with increasing substrate temperature. In
addition, decreasing the crystal defect and increasing the grain size was also produced with
increasing substrate temperature. Since the deposited atom would obtain more kinetic energy with
higher substrate temperature, ZnO-doped ZST films with uniform grains and lower surface
roughness could be fabricated, which resulted in a reduction of the leakage current. A leakage
current density of 7.35×10-9A/cm2 was obtained near an electrical field of 1 kV/cm with rf power of
400W and substrate temperature of 400C is very similar to the leakage current density of SiO2.
