1.1 Importance of PTT (poly(trimethylene terephthalate))
Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), synthesized from polycondensation of
1,3-propanediol with dimethyl terephthalate, is a member of aromatic polyesters. (Fig. 1) It has
long been known that PTT fibers have mechanical properties (elastic recovery and resiliency)
that are better than its homologues neighbors poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and
poly(butylenes terephthalate) (PBT), and comparable to nylon 6 and nylon 66. PTT is also found
to be quite compatible with other fibers in blends and can be easily dyed into various colors
under normal processing conditions. Although PTT has such excellent fiber properties, its
commercial application has been limited to high-end textures such as swimming suits and sports
wear and casual clothing, where resilience is important. This is because the high cost of
synthesizing its monomer, 1,3-propanediol. Recently, Shell Chemicals discovered a low-cost
process for producing 1,3-propanediol, making PTT an inexpensive material for broader
applications such as thin films and thermoplastic materials, in addition to fine garments
(replacing nylons).
1.2 Past researches on PTT
Our understanding about the mechanical and thermophysical properties of PTT has
enhanced drastically soon after the commercial production of PTT (trade named Corterra by
Shell) in 1990s. This is evidenced by the active researches on various aspects of PTT in the past
5 years, especially on the rheology properties 1, melting and crystallization kinetics 2-13, and the
blend with other polymers 14-28, in addition to the structure 29-37, mechanical 38-42, and
thermophysical properties 43-47. There is a very nice summary on properties of PTT and
comparison with other commercial fibers by the Taiwan Man-Made Fiber Industries Association
(TMMFIA) 48.
Although the properties of PTT in the crystalline, semi-crystalline, and amorphous states are
well established, it remains a great challenge to control certain targeted properties of PTT fibers
obtained in the production lines. As is true for most polymers, the morphology of PTT fibers is

largely in the gauche state, and1 conformation exists largely in the trans state. In amorphous
phase,2 conformation exists mostly in the trans state, but1 conformation is unclear. Moreover,
during the annealing process,2 conformation changes form trans state to gauche state but1
conformation is unclear. During drawing process, 2 conformation changes form trans state to
gauche state, if polymer chains undergo sufficient thermal relaxation; however, 1 conformation
is unclear.
In this three-year project, we have successfully used molecular dynamics simulations to
determine the structure, energetic, and vibrational (Infrared) properties of PTT both in the
crystalline and in the amorphous state. Based on this foundation, we have moved forward to
study the crystallization process of PTT under thermal (cooling) and stress (drawing) treatments.
1.3 Past researches on the polymer crystallization from molecular simulations
In classical theory of nucleation, the crystallization of a material when cooled to a
temperature below its melting point is generally recognized to be a two-stage process. In the
stage of primary nucleation, crystal nuclei (clusters comprising ordered molecules) appear and
re-dissolve via molecular collisions until the size of a nucleus reaches some critical value, above
which the nuclei are thermodynamically stable. The subsequent growth of the critical nuclei
follows kinetic mechanism and is classified as growth process. Complicated by additional
constraints in topological connectivity, the crystallization in polymers presents remarkable
differences both in the nucleation and in the growth stages when compared to that in small
molecules. While extensive experimental2, 4, 7, 12 and theoretical62-66 efforts are made to verify and
explain the molecular mechanism in the growth of nuclei in polymeric materials, the primary
stage of polymer crystallization67-69 is less well understood. Experimental results from
small-angle X-ray70-72 and dielectric spectroscopy73, 74 measurements suggest the development of
large-scale structures priori to any detectable formation of crystallites. This has led some
researchers to believe the formation of a precursor phase via spinodal decomposition at the early
stage of polymer crystallization. The existence of nucleus precursors may attribute to the
memory effects in polymeric materials.75 However, with the enhancement of resolution in
scattering measurements such a view is continuously challenged by some researchers,76-80 who
believe that the crystallization should follow the classical nucleation-growth mechanism.
Molecular dynamics simulations provide an useful perspective from a molecular scale for
study the mechanism of polymer crystallization. Most simulation studies focus on the stress (or
flow) induced crystallization phenomenon by pre-oriented chains,54, 55, 81-84 and extensional flow
field;56 while a few of them investigate the crystallization driven by sub-melting point
temperature.66, 85-89 Recently Gee et al.86 used molecular dynamic simulation techniques to study
the primary nucleation of poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, and polyethylene, PE. They reported
the formation of a precursor phase via spinodal decomposition as the polymer melt is quenched
82. Simulation Details
The initial structures of PTT are prepared using the Amorphous Builders module
implemented in commercial package Cerius2.95 Two different sized systems are used in this
study. The smaller system contains 4 chains of PTT molecules, each having a degree of
polymerization of 27 (i.e., 5568g/mol. Note that the entanglement molecular weight of PTT was
determined to be 4900 to 5000 g/mol90, 96), and the larger sized system contains 8 chains of the
same molecules. The small sized models (containing 108 repeating units of PTT, or equivalently
2708 atoms) are used in most studies whereas the larger systems are used for examining the
system size effects. The computer code LAMMPS97 is used for all subsequent molecular
mechanic and molecular dynamic simulations. A series of expansion and compression steps were
applied to the initial structures in order to obtain equilibrium samples at 600K (which is above
the melting temperature Tm). The equilibration process proceeded as follows. The simulation box
is first expended via increasing the cell lengths by 125% (e.g., from 30.53Å to 33.58Å for small
systems) over a period of 60ps. The box is then compressed by reducing the cell lengths to 95%
of the initial values (from 33.58Å to 29Å) over a period of 100ps. The cell lengths are then
increased to their initial values within 50ps (from 29Å to 30.53Å). Finally, the simulation box is
equilibrated at 600 K using NPT ensemble for 100ps. The equilibrated sample is then cooled to
50 K at a rate of 1 K/ps. At each 50 K interval during the quenching process, simulation samples
are taken and subjected to long (up to 24 ns), constant temperature and pressure simulations
(NPT) for property analysis. For the study of stress-induced crystallization, each of the samples
(from the quenching process) drawn with different drawing speeds (1x108s-1(only at 400K),
1x109s-1, 1x1010s-1, and 1x1011s-1), and isothermally relaxed at several draw ratios (DR=1, 2, 3,
and 4) up to 12 ns with pressure at 0 bar and NTLxyyzz ensemble with zero normal stress in y
and z directions.98
In all the simulations, the generic force field Dreiding99 is used to describe the valence
(bond stretching, angle bending, torsion angle rotation, and inversion) and van der Waals
interactions among atoms in a system. All the default values were used except for the torsion
terms of the propylene glycol segment (O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O) being modified to better reproduce

3. Results and Discussion
In the following the result of our simulation work is organized in six parts: (1) Properties of
Crystalline PTT, (2) the mechanical property of amorphous PTT, (3) the melting and glass
transition temperature of PTT, (4) infrared spectra of crystalline and amorphous PTT, (5) the
formation of internal microstructures of PTT while quenching from the melted state, and (6) the
evolution of internal microstructures of PTT upon drawing. The first two parts are served as a
validation of the force field used in our simulation.

Table 1 compares the lattice parameters, torsional angles (1,2,'1,'2 as indicated in Fig.
1), and density of crystalline PTT from simulation and experiment.29, 30 In general, the simulation
results are in good agreement with experiment. It is interesting to note that the asymmetric
torsional angles (1≠'1, and2≠'2) observed in experiment is also seen in our simulation.

3.2. Mechanical property (Yong’s modulus) of amorphous PTT
The elastic constant of PTT is determined from the slope of the stress-strain curves. The
amorphous PTT sample is stretched in some direction (x, y, or z axis) at 3 different deformation
rates (1011 s-1 to 109 s-1). The results are illustrated in Fig. 2. Table 2 summarizes the calculated
resultof Young’smodulus. The average value from simulation is 3.35±0.21 GPa. This is in good
agreement with that from experiments, 2.3~2.8 GPa 39, 110, 111.

3.3. Infrared spectra of crystalline and amorphous PTT
The IR spectra of both crystalline and amorphous PTT at 300 K are calculated from the
molecular dynamic simulations. Tables 3 and 4 show the characteristic modes of the CH2
vibrations from MD and experiment. The MD results are obtained directly from pure crystalline
and pure amorphous samples. Such pure phase samples are difficult to obtain in experiment. Kim
et al.,32 used the factor analysis to extract the pure spectra with a factor analysis of IR spectra
obtained from undrawn PPT films annealed under various conditions. In general, all the
characteristic modes observed in experiment can be found in the calculated spectrum, despite a
blue-shift for modes at frequencies higher than ~800 cm-1 and a red shift for modes lower than
800cm-1. This is a result of the simplified valence force constants used in the Dreiding force field.
The remarkable agreement between the simulation results and factor analysis of experimental IR
suggests that these tools are useful for studying molecular vibrations of PTT at various degrees
of crystallization.

3.5 Formation of internal microstructures whiling cooling PTT from its melt
3.5.1 Identification of internal microstructure in PTT
To detect and quantify any structural development, we define the local ordering in the
system as follows. (1) A segment of PTT is defined to be the vector pointing from the center of
an aromatic ring to the next aromatic ring on the same polymer chain (green cylinders in Fig. 1).
(2) Adjacent segments are defined as those whose separation distance between centers of mass
falls within 9 Å. (3) Two adjacent segments whose included angles are within 10 degrees are
marked as mutually parallel. (4) A locally ordered structure is identified as a cluster containing
mutually parallel segments. The cluster defined by such criteria has an orientationally ordered
but loosely packed structure. Based on this definition, we may easily determine the number ns of
clusters containing s parallel segments at any instant of time in the course of dynamic simulation.
For example, the clusters identified from the NPT simulation at 400K and 6 time instants are
illustrated in Fig. 4. One can easily visualize the formation and development of such internally
ordered clusters. In the beginning of the simulation (e.g. 62 ps) most of the segments are
disordered (in yellow). Several medium sized clusters (magenta, pink, red) start to form and
some of them may continue to grow to a highly oriented but loosely packed cluster (blue, after
1102 ps).

scale (from yellow (s=1) to dark blue (s=8)) is used for better discrimination of the size of

amount of local ordering starts to fluctuate. Figure 6 shows the average amount of clusters as a
function of temperature. Strikingly the temperature dependence of the fraction of clusters curve
resembles that of crystallization rate for common polymers, i.e., having a maximum between Tg
and Tm.113
With a closer analysis of the simulation trajectory, we found that the formation and growth
of these clusters is a highly dynamical process. In the liquid state (600 K) there are constant
formation and disintegration of small clusters (s=2,3,4,5) via segment vibration and collisions,
i.e., these clusters are short-lived. As the system is quenched below Tm, some segments may
agglomerate or deposit on a nearby cluster to form larger sized clusters. In the subsequent NPT
runs, these cluster may grow, break down to small clusters, or dissolve back to the amorphous
phase. Both the growth and disintegration of clusters are observed in this stage, however, the net
effect (for a certain sized cluster to grow or dissolve) depends on the temperature and the size of
the cluster (as it should be driven by thermodynamic equilibrium). As the temperature falls

PTT). It can be seen that the intensity of the second peak increases with time as a result to the
better packing within the cluster. In Fig. 8(a,c,e) the time variation of the intensity of this peak is
shown for the largest clusters at 350 K, 400 K and 450 K. (We have analyzed the properties for
all clusters112 and found that these cases are good representatives to explain the structure
development within the clusters). Although fluctuating, there is a general trend of enhancement
of the peak intensity with time. The size (number of parallel segments) evolutions of the same
clusters are shown on the same plots for comparison. It can be seen that, while both properties
increase with time, there is no direct correlation between them. The result indicates that better
packing of the segments could sometimes be compromised as the cluster grows in size, and vice
versa.

segment to reorganize to form a more compact cluster. Therefore, the baby nuclei could
eventually become compact nuclei along the crystallization process. However, internal structure
development of such baby nuclei (e.g. torsional reorganization) takes place at a much slower rate
(compared to the formation of baby nuclei). As a consequence, it is observed (experimentally) a
long induction period prior to the crystallization of polymers.
3.6 Evolution of internal microstructures of PTT upon drawing
3.6.1 Variation of Bulk phase properties upon drawing
The changes in bulk properties are observed (Fig. 11) during stress-induced crystallization
in our simulation. The increase of the amount of precursors in the draw process is much more
remarkable than that in isothermal crystallization. Furthermore, the subsequent process of
relaxation (NVT simulation after the drawing process) would lead to further increase in the
fraction of oriented precursors. The rapid density decrease in each simulation indicates that the
defects (voids) in the bulk phase are created during the drawing processes. At high draw speeds
(1x1010 s-1, and 1x1011 s-1) and the temperatures below Tg the formation of defects is prominent;
on the other hand, at the slower draw speeds (1x108 s-1, and 1x109 s-1) and temperatures above Tg

temperatures, and stress effect, which is prominent at faster draw speed and lower temperatures.
On the other hand, the torsional energy decreases with DR at lower draw speeds (1x109 s-1, and
1x1010 s-1), but fluctuates at the highest draw speed (1x1011 s-1). It is almost a linear function of
temperature at constant DR. These results support that the stress effect influents the backbone
chain rotation much more than thermal effect.
3.6.2 Development of internal microstructures upon drawing
As shown in Fig. 12, at small DR (DR=2), the fraction of precursors increases in all
temperatures with slower draw speeds (1x109s-1 and 1x1010s-1), but decreases at temperatures
350K and 400K with higher draw speed (1x1011s-1). At larger DR (DR>3), the saturation of
induced precursor is observed for all temperatures with the slowest draw speed (1x109s-1). On the
other hand, the development of precursors continues at the higher draw speed (1x1010s-1 and
1x1010s-1). Besides, the orientation factor increases with DR, and the curves are similar in all
situations, indicating that the orientation factor may be a function of draw ratio only. This implies
that the stress-induced precursor is similar at the same DR with each draw speed.
The subsequent thermal relaxation (following the drawing process) could stabilize and
facilitate in the growth of oriented precursors. The results of the fraction of precursors (Fig. 13)
shows a temperature dependence similar to that of the isothermal crystallization, but the position
of highest amount of precursors shifts to a lower temperature (300K with drawing vs 400 K
without drawing114). The local motion of polymer segments would be induced by uni-axis stress.
(Note the maximum capacity of precursor formation should be found between the temperature
allowing for short rage motion and that for entire chain motion.)

Before drawing, the fraction of trans state is ~34%, and that of gauche is ~25% in the bulk
phase; the most populated conformations in1 is trans, and that in2 is gauche; i.e., the most
populated conformations in the backbone torsions are t-g-g-t (1-2-2-1). During draw process,
the t-t-t-t conformation increases. Our results are in agreement with the result of Chuch’s
experimental observation.60 The thermal relaxation would change the conformations in some of
our simulations, but the changes are not obvious.
The states of backbone torsional angles in precursors evolve with DR differently in different
processing conditions. The fraction of1 in trans increases with DR, but the fraction of 2 in
gauche decreases with DR in most precursors. The stress and thermal effects are different in
these two torsional angles. Slower draw speed and lower temperature would improve the change
of1 to the trans state; on the other hand, the faster draw speed and medium temperatures would
improve the change of2 to the gauche state. Furthermore, the fraction of1 in trans is very high
(~70%) in each precursor, but the fraction of2 in gauche only 20~30%. That indicates that the
stress-induced transition in 2 is faster than that in1. In addition, the faction of2 in gauche
fluctuates in some cases, indicating the torsional angle 2 would favorably move to the gauche
after forcing to the trans state by the external stress.

5. Project Self-Evaluation (計畫成果自評)
Overall Evaluation: Exceeds Expectations
Thanks to the funding support from NSC, we were able to tackle the important problem of
polymer property-morphology relations from a molecular perspective. Such understanding
allows for developing new processing technology that lead to high function polymeric materials.
This work represents a important step towards enhancement of material properties via controlling
its morphology at microscopic scale. So far specific project accomplishments include
1. Infrared analysis on PTT whiling cooling from the melt
2. Investigation the change of infrared spectrum during the crystallization of PTT
3. Understanding of the property-morphology relationships of PTT fibers
4. Mechanism of thermal-induced polymer crystallization at earlier stage
5. Mechanism of stress-induced polymer crystallization at earlier stage
These results greatly improve our understanding of PTT fibers and its morphological change
under thermal and stress treatments.
In addition to the achievements listed above (which are published in master’s thesis,
conference proceedings, and journal papers), we are currently developing macroscopic models to
describe the melt-spinning process used in the industry. Our research results (from this project)
provide the polymer properties (rate of crystallization, Tg, Tm, bulk modulus) that are needed in
the continuum level models. The combination of both methods could lead to a new way of
developing and understanding the process of PTT fiber productions. According to Taiwan
Man-Made Fiber Industries Association (TMMFIA) 48, the world production of PTT fibers will
be increased to 1 million ton per year by year 2010. The low-cost production of PTT will greatly
impact the current fiber industry in Taiwan. Understanding how the fiber processing affects fiber
morphology is critical for us to be competitive in the world trade market.

Stress-Induced Crystallization of Poly(Trimethylene Terephthalate) Fibers by Molecular
Dynamic Simulations
Min-Kang Hsieh and Shiang-Tai Lin, Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan
University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan
We have used atomistic molecular dynamic simulations to study isothermal crystallization of
poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) at various temperatures and various degree of external
stresses. While extensive experimental and theoretical efforts are made to verify and explain the
molecular mechanism in the growth of nuclei in polymeric materials, the primary stage of
polymer crystallization is less well understood. Our atomistic reveal the formation and growth of
highly oriented but loosely packed clusters (nucleus precursors) upon quenching a melted
semi-rigid polymer. This work we force on the stress-induced crystallization phenomena which
happened on the industrial process of the fiber spinning. While such a process has been used to
42
factor of the pure components are used. This method is, in principle, applicable to any chemical
species and is especially useful for those whose experimental data are not available.
