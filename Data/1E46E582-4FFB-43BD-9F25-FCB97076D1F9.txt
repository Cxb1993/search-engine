Abstract
The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between human factors and the 
fit factors of disposable mask. Based on above relationship to develop the human factor index 
of fitting mask for workers selecting proper mask. The index also benefits the mask 
manufactory for designing best fitting mask for Taiwan workers.The different brands of 
disposable mask were conducted fitting-test. Fit factors were determined by TSI 8020 
PortaCount Plus with and without N95-Companion. Before fit-testing, the human factors were 
measured. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and 
quadratic polynomial regression analysis with log-transformed fit factors (LNFF). 
Human factors are not mutually independent, which indicates that analysis of multiple 
regression multicollinearity between human factors and LNFF is needed. The results show that 
the one who had outstanding human factor also had good fit factor. Using the quadratic term 
for the regression equation, lip width, face width, face length and head surround length, were 
good prediction for mask fit. This result indicates that up lip-subnasal length (ULSL) and body 
mass index (BMI) are good predictors of N95 mask fit and should be preferentially considered 
in the design of N95 mask respirators for Taiwanese.
Keywords: human factors, disposable mask, fit-testing, polynomial regression analysis.
INTRODUCTION
Since its emergence in the first month of 2003, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) had been characterized by rapid spread among healthcare workers (HCWs). 
The infection rate of front-line HCWs was very high. Even through they were equipped in the 
later stage with the best protective devices available on the market, a number of HCWs were 
still reported infected.(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the primary 
route SARS infection is through to be via droplets through the mouth, nose and eyes. In 
particular, HCWs caring for SARS patients are recommended to wear a disposable respirator 
certified as at least N95 level according to the US National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health (NIOSH) standard (42 CFR 84): they must provide greater than 95% filtration of 
300nm sodium chloride particles at a flow rate of 85L/min. A higher filtering efficiency should 
3Each respirator was quantitatively ﬁt-tested by each subject according to the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation protocol. Before testing, ﬁt checks were 
conducted to determine whether the mask was properly adjusted to the face. During the ﬁt-test 
the subjects were asked to perform six ﬁt-test exercises, which included (1) normal breathing; 
(2) deep breathing; (3) movement of the head from side to side; (4) movement of the head up 
and down; (5) reading or talking; and (6) normal breathing. The instrument used for ﬁt-testing 
was a PortaCount Plus 8020 (TSI Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) with and without N95-Companion 
connected to an IBM Notebook computer. The PortaCount Plus is a quantitative fit-test 
instrument that uses ambient particles as the challenge agent and counts the number inside and 
outside of the facepiece. The number inside is divided into the number outside and a fit factor 
is displayed. PortaCount Plus with the N95 Companion which is designed to count only 
particles resulting from face-seal leakage.(7,8)

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for presenting and analyzing human factor 
anthropometric data. Measured Fit-Factor (FFs) were right-skewed, which is consistent with 
the normal distribution and the log transformed FFs that used the natural logarithm (LNFF) did 
not differ significantly from the normal distribution. Therefore, LNFFs were used for 
subsequent statistical analyses. Student’s t-test was used to determine whether there were 
gender differences in human factors.
The relationship between the LNFF and each human factor was analyzed using curve 
estimation regression statistics and related plots for eleven different models because the 
relationship among them may be nonlinear. These eleven models as above included linear, 
logarithmic, inverse, quadratic, cubic, power, compound, S-curve, logistic, growth, and 
exponential. A separate model was used to analyze the relationship between the LNFF and 
each human factor in 140 related plots. These 140 related plots reveal that the relationship 
between the LNFF and each human factor is not linear. The cubic, quadratic and linear were 
the best three models in regular order among the above eleven models for the goodness of fit 
of the model. To test whether variation in the LNFF data could be explained by the human 
factor data, a best subset third-order polynomial regression analysis was used to select 
common prognostic variables, because the coefficient of partial correlation for a quadratic and 
a cubic term between LNFF and human factors may be significant by partial correlation 
analysis. In this model a standardized transformation of the independent variables in the 
polynomial regression was recommended to permit the relative comparisons of the estimated 
regression coefficients in common units. Another reason for using a standardized predictor 
variable in the polynomial regression model is that the first and second power terms often are 
5careful attention should be paid to multicollinearity if these human factors are to be used as 
predictors for LNFF in a regression model. 
The correlation coefficient gives only a numerical summary of the strength and 
direction of a linear relationship. The relationship among them may be nonlinear. The 
relationship between the LNFF and each human factor was analyzed using curve estimation 
regression statistics and related plots for eleven different models, to examine whether there is a 
linear or nonlinear relationship between LNFF versus human factors. These eleven models as 
above included linear, logarithmic, inverse, quadratic, cubic, power, compound, S-curve, 
logistic, growth, and exponential. A separate model was used to analyze the relationship 
between the LNFF and each human factor in 140 related plots. Figure 3 is an example of these 
related plot analyses. A scatter plot matrix for the average LNFF of all the fourteen different 
masks versus human factors with 11 regression line were shown in Figure 2. These 140 related 
plots reveal that the relationship between the LNFF and each human factor is nonlinear rather 
than linear. The cubic, quadratic and linear were the best three models in regular order among 
the above eleven regression models for the goodness of fit of the model. To test whether 
variation in the LNFF data could be explained by the human factor data, a best subset 
third-order polynomial regression analysis was used to select common prognostic variables. 
The partial correlation analysis results show that there are a few human factors in which the 
coefficients of partial correlation for the quadratic term and cubic term are higher than that of 
the linear term. A consideration of a cubic relationship including the quadratic and linear term 
is recommended.

7coefficients of determination (R2) were low as a whole and indicated that only gender-specific 
models account for a large amount of the variation in LNFF. More specifically, the coefficients 
of determination were higher for female than for male in 9 of 14 mask types. The highest R2
was 0.694 both for mask type 3 and 4+N95 for female and   male, respectively. However, R2
of mask type 6 was 0.419, the highest for whole, and also was the second highest both for 
female and male, 0.608 and 0.649, respectively. Therefore, The mask type 6 used in this study 
would be preferentially considered to predict fit for Taiwanese.

The results of regression analysis were summarized in Table 4. No common human 
factors were found to be significant for all 42 mask-type/gender subgroups. However, the 
human factors correlation and the regression model were significantly different between 
genders. Therefore, the significance of variable was analyzed by genders. The significance of 
variable is the appearance times of significant variable (p-value＜0.05) in the regression 
equations for different mask type, as shown in Table 5. The significance for female in linear 
term, quadratic term and cubic term is NOSW, ULSL, and ULSL, respectively. The 
significance for male in linear term, quadratic term and cubic term is ZYGO and BMI, CW and 
BMI, ZYGO, respectively. The significance for female + male in linear term, quadratic term 
and cubic term is ZYGO, ULSL, and ULSL and BMI, respectively. The significance for female 
+ male is not much differ from and can included the better significance for female and male. 
However, the significance for all and female + male + all are differ from the significances of 
above mention, the latter is the summation of the significance of female and male and the 
former is the significance of whole tested people. It seems likely that the significance for female 
+ male is better than the significance for all and female + male + all to present the significance 
for both female and male. Furthermore, it appears that the predictive ability of a cubic term 
variable should be more important than that of a linear or quadratic term variable, because 
cubic value greatly influences predictability. The levels of significance for female and male are 
varied from 1 to 7 and 1 to 6, respectively. However, the levels of significance for female + 
male are narrow down 5 to 8. It seems as though the significance of human factors for female 
+ male is not much difference. It implies that the analysis of significance of variable by genders 
is better than whole people. The up lip-subnasal length (ULSL), bizygomatic breadth (ZYGO), 
and up lip-subnasal length (ULSL) and body mass index (BMI) for female in 7of 14, for male 
in 6 of 14 and for female + male in 8 of 28 mask type subgroups, respectively, were found to 
be correlated with fit by cubic term analysis. The ULSL and ZYGO present the inside space of 
mask and the BMI present the gasket around the border of mask, it implies that if there is a 
good fit facial dimension and more muscle in face will improve the N95 mask fit. This result 
indicates that up lip-subnasal length (ULSL) and body mass index (BMI) are good predictors 
of N95 mask fit and should be preferentially considered in the design of N95 mask respirators
