Abstract 
The effect of glass phase-separation on the optical absorption and emission spectra in 
glasses with 40SiO2-35P2O5-15Na2O-6Al2O3-xEu2O3 composition were investigated. The glasses 
were prepared by rapid quenching of the 1450oC melts and phase separation was induced by 
heat-treatment at 600oC for different exposure times. The photoluminescence and glass 
phase-separation were correlated and discussed. A surprising experimental result was found that 
for the same glass sample the intensity of photoluminescence increases as the heating time 
prolonged. The intensity of the emission peak at 5D0→7F2 was increased by a factor of 11 after 
the glass sample been heat-treated at 600oC for 100 hr.

1. Introduction 
Liquid-liquid phase separation is potentially applicable to prepare new functional glasses as 
shown in many previous works. [1,2] A droplet-like phase can be obtained from glass 
phase-separation via a nucleation and growth mechanism. [3-5] Such droplet-phase could be used 
as a micro optical resonator [6,7] by morphology-dependent resonances.  Elongation of droplets 
by pulling glass may change the glasses from optically isotropic to anisotropic. [2] It has also 
been reported that non-linear optical glasses doped with nanometer-sized microcrystallites with 
large third-order non-linearities and short response time could be produced by crystallizing such 
precipitated droplets. [8,9] Because the two separated phases are different in their solubility of a 
certain elements, particularly the elements of glass modifiers, the droplets may be used as micro 
cages to trap certain elements generating new properties and functions in glasses.      
Optical properties of rare earth ion-doped glasses are widely investigated for potential 
application in optical devices such as upconversion lasers, hole burning high-density memory, 
and laser-induced holographic gratings [10-12]. In all these cases a knowledge of the rare earth in 
hosts is valuable[13]. The optical properties of rare-earth doped glasses may be enhanced by 
glass phase-separation. In this study, we investigated how the glass phase separation changed the 
spectroscopic properties of Eu-doped sodium silicophosphate glasses, particularly the influence 
of duration of heat-treatment.  
 
2.  Experimental 
Denoting the glass composition by 15Na2O-35P2O5-40SiO2-6Al2O3-xEu2O3 (NPSxEu), 
they attribute the progressive intensity losses at low wavelengths to the increase in number of 
phase-boundaries and the growth of the new phases is responsible for the shift of the onset of 
scattering toward higher wavelengths. Hence, from the absorption spectra in Fig. 2, it may imply 
that the homogeneity of Eu-doped glasses gradually decreases as the content of europium oxide 
increases, and the glass phase-separation may already take place to a certain extent immediately 
after the quenching process. The effect of heat-treatment on the NPS1Eu sample shown in Fig. 3 
also confirms the time-dependent growth mechanism of the phase-separation which, in turn, 
causes the increase in light scattering.        
The absorption peak at 464 nm, corresponding to the transition between 7F0 and 5D2, was 
selected as the excitation wavelength for photoluminescence measurement.  As shown in Figs. 4 
and 5, the Eu-doped sodium silicophosphate glasses appear five emission transitions such as: 5D0 
→
 7F0, 7F1, 7F2, 7F3, and 7F4, corresponding to the wavelengths at 565 nm, 592 nm, 613 nm, 642 
nm and 700nm, respectively.  According to Annapurna et al., [15]the fact that there is no 
emission from excited levels above the 5D0 such as 5D3,2,1 could be possibly due to non-radiative 
multiphonon assisted relaxation among closely situated energy levels.  It may follow the decay 
route of 5D3→5D2→5D1→5D0 energy level and thus only 5D0→7F0,1,2,3,4 emissions can be 
observed.  The 5D0→7F1 transition is caused by magnetic dipole effect, which is allowed by all 
selection rules and is independent of glass host matrix. The transitions 5D0→7F2,4 are electric 
dipole in nature and may be affected by the surrounding environment. [16] Therefore, the electric 
dipole 5D0→7F2 to magnetic dipole 5D0→7F1 transition intensity ratio can be regarded as an 
indicator of the local symmetry, higher is the value, more would be the non-centrosymmetric 
nature of the Eu3+ site. From the emission spectra shown in Fig.4, the asymmetric ratio has been 
calculated and plotted in Fig. 6, in which the asymmetric ratio increases from 2.07 for the glass 
doped with 0.25 mole Eu2O3 to 3.23 for that doped with 1 mole Eu2O3.  Apparently, the vicinity 
of the Eu3+ ions becomes less symmetry as its concentration increases. It is believed that the site 
symmetry is related to the covalency between the rare earth metal ion and its ligand. [14-16] Less 
site symmetry usually means more covalency for the Eu3+ ion with its surrounding oxygen.   
In Fig. 5, a piece of the glass sample NPS1Eu was taken for measuring its photoluminescence 
spectrum prior to heat-treatment. The same piece of glass was then placed in a preheated 
electrical furnace at 600oC for 20, 40 and 100 hr. After each heat-treatment, the sample was taken 
out from the furnace and quickly cooled to room temperature for photoluminescence 
measurement. The purpose of using the same piece of glass was to eliminate any unnecessary 
deviation due to sample geometrical dimension change.  An interesting result was observed that 
the emission intensity of the NPS1Eu glass at 613 nm increased dramatically as the heating 
duration prolonged. As shown in the sub-diagram of Fig.5, the emission intensity increased 
almost linearly with the heating duration. The intensity of the emission peak at 613 nm was 
enhanced by a factor of 11 after the sample been heated for 100 hr. A possible explanation for this 
phenomenon of enhanced photoluminescence might be due to (i) the concentration-gathering 
effect, i.e., more Eu3+ ions are gathered in the phosphate-rich phase when increasing heating time; 
or (ii) morphology-dependent resonance effect, which means phase-separated glass containing 
nano-size or submicro-size droplets or tunnels may act as laser cavities that has a resonance effect 
resulting from strong light scattering. [17] Currently we do not have enough evidence to prove or 
eliminate any one of the possibilities and further investigations in this phenomenon are necessary
