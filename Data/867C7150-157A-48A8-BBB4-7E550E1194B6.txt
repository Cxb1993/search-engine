Abstract 
Optical fibers and their devices are one of the most important elements in the 
communication and sensing systems. To maintain the high mechanical strength, the conventional 
optical fibers are coated with polymeric coatings during the fabrication process. However, 
polymer-coated optical fibers possess low fatigue-resistance in preventing the permeation of 
water to maintain the long-term mechanical strength. Therefore, high fatigue-resistance optical 
fibers, which are coated with hermetic materials, are extensively studied and predicted to be one 
of the important technologies in the future optical fiber communication. Amorphous carbon is 
expected to be one of the suitable hermetic materials for optical fibers, due to the properties of 
carbons being similar to those of silica glass fibers. In this two-years project, the glass fiber will 
be coated with carbon films by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. In the first 
year, the carbon is prepared by controlling the ratio of argon and methane. In the second year, the 
carbon is prepared by controlling the mixture ratio of argon, hydrogen and methane. The physical 
properties of carbon-coated optical fibers will be measured in different environments. Meanwhile, 
the thermal stress in the fiber will be experimentally and theoretically studied. Additionally, the 
microstructure, optical properties and roughness of carbon coatings will be analyzed. There are 
twelve papers done in this two-years project. Nine papers have been published or accepted, and 
the others are submitted or prepared to submit.

成果報告內容 
1. 計畫緣由與研究目的 
自從 1970 年美國的康寧（Corning）玻璃公司公開宣佈可以作為光纖通訊媒介的低傳
輸損失玻璃光纖研製成功以後，光纖通訊系統有了一日千里的發展[1]。近年來由於資訊的
爆炸，加上多媒體通訊的發展，使得全球網路的需求日益迫切。光纖通訊可提供足夠的傳
輸品質，所以光纖通訊的需求便隨著各種通訊網路建設擴充、提升而快速成長。而在光纖
通訊中，光纖（Optical Fiber）及其元件為主要的基本元件之一。光纖相較於傳統銅線電
纜，具有下列優點：高頻寬（High Bandwidth）、低損失（Low Loss）、體積小、重量輕、
不受電磁波干擾（Electromagnetic Interference）和保密性高等[1−4]，所以非常適合作為通
訊的傳輸媒介。隨著科技的進步，光纖除了應用在傳送語音外，亦可以使用在傳送數據和
影像方面。藉由光纖通訊系統，資料傳遞的能力可達傳統銅線通訊電纜的萬倍以上。光纖
的應用範圍涵蓋了長途電話、局間中繼電路、海纜通訊系統、用戶迴路、視訊會議、區域
網路、有線電視、國防工業及工業儀器等。光纖通訊歷經數十餘年來的發展，整個長途電
信網路的光纖化已經完成。隨著世界各國興建資訊高速公路的熱潮以及我國政府的大力推
動國家資訊基礎建設，國內各電信、資訊通訊、甚至娛樂業者紛紛投入多媒體光纖網路市
場。在有線電視開放與電信自由化等因素的配合下，光纖通訊的時代正式在台灣揭開序
幕，最後將可能實現光纖到家（Fiber To The Home, FTTH）的終極目標，由光纖提供視覺
的、聲音的、數據的整體服務。未來，光纖取代銅線的地位，和人們生活關係密切，將是
必然的趨勢。 
國外目前對於光纖領域的研究，還是以光纖通訊為主。重點放在主幹網路之設計與效
能提升，包括了光纖、光纜、雷射光源、光纖光放大器、分波多工器…等不勝枚舉。國內
也有研究團隊投入相關領域並著眼於通訊零組件或設備的製造，並對目前現有的光纖及其
元件作最大效率之整合應用，但少有研究團隊能夠從最基本的材料觀點進行研發。然而，
想要得到擁有更好壽命的光纖元件，所有的關鍵均掌握在於材料及精密先進的鍍膜技術。 
傳統光纖結構是以折射率較低的纖殼（Cladding）包覆著中心部份為折射率較高之纖
核（Core），內外兩層之材料同為二氧化矽玻璃。光纖在製造過程中都會在玻璃光纖外面
再加上塑膠被覆以增加其機械強度。塑膠被覆通常包括兩層，第一塑膠被覆層是採用楊氏
模數較小的材料，以做為應力緩衝層和降低光纖之微曲損失；而第二塑膠被覆層是採用楊
氏模數較大的材料，用來承受外在機械力並保護玻璃光纖以維持光纖之機械強度[4]。加上
塑膠被覆之光纖擁有不錯的拉力強度（6GPa 以上）和較小的光傳輸損失（Excess Loss）。
然而，塑膠被覆層對於長時間抵抗水氣入侵而維持光纖機械強度之抗疲勞性並非很好。所
謂抗疲勞性是指光纖在外界環境影響下而仍能保有長時間高機械強度的能力，一般是以 n 
值表示此種能力。n 值愈大，表示光纖保有長時間高機械強度之能力愈好，而一般塑膠被
覆光纖之 n 值約在 20 與 30 之間[5]。因此，為了再提高光纖之抗疲勞性，另一種再加上
密封鍍層 ( Hermetic Coating )而擁有高 n 值 (n>100)的密封鍍層光纖 (如圖一所示 ) 
(Hermetically-Coated Optical Fiber)引起廣泛地研究，並被預測是未來光纖通訊的重要技術

rearrangement, the bending curvature 1/R can be represented
as
1/R = f2sa1 − a0dDTE1st2 − t1dg/sE0r0
2d . s1d
Notably, Eq. s1d shows that if the carbon coating is uniformly
deposited on the glass fiber surface st2= t1d, the fiber would
not be bent after the temperature change.
The axial residual stress in the carbon coating is induced
simultaneously by the bending moment and axial force.
However, the axial force-induced axial stress is much larger
than the bending moment-induced axial stress, so the axial
stress in the carbon coating can be simply expressed as
sz = FzsGd/A1 = fsa1 − a0dDTE1g . s2d
Substituting Eq. s1d into s2d, Eq. s2d becomes
sz = s1/RdsE0r0
2d/f2st2 − t1dg . s3d
For commercial optical fibers, E0 and r0 usually are
72.5 GPa and 62.5 mm, respectively.6 Consequently, if the
relation between s1/Rd and st2− t1d is known, the axial re-
sidual stress sz can be obtained. Notably, in order to account
for the actual biaxial stress distributions in the carbon coat-
ing, rather than the uniaxial stresses assumed for ease of
derivation in this work, it is necessary to replace E0 by
E0 / s1−n0d in Eq. s3d. However, n0s=0.17d is small and the
fiber axial length is much larger than the fiber radius, so it is
not necessary to consider the effect of Poisson’s ratio n0 in
this case. Equation s3d is simple and easy to use, it is very
similar to the Stoney equation used to measure the residual
stress in the thin film deposited on a planar substrate from
the bending curvature of the planar substrate.15–18
The experiment proceeded as follows. First, the carbon
materials were deposited on the outer surface of the glass
fiber using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
sPECVDd method. The glass fiber is a standard single-mode
fiber with outer diameter 2r0 equaling 125 mm. The carbon
coating was prepared using methane during the PECVD pro-
cess. Five samples of carbon-coated optical fibers with iden-
tical fiber length s<100 mmd but different coating thick-
nesses were obtained by controlling the deposition time, with
the deposition time being 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min, respec-
tively. The temperature of the fiber holder was controlled at
250 °C. After the deposition process was finished, the
samples were cooled down to the room temperature s25 °Cd
in the process chamber. In this step, the temperature change
DT was 225 °C. This experiment showed that the fibers were
bent after the coating process and temperature drop were
finished. The bending radius of the fiber was immediately
measured by drawing the bending curve of the fiber on the
graph paper. Second, the thickness of the carbon coating was
obtained by measuring the cross section of the optical fiber
using the scanning electron microscope sSEMd. Meanwhile,
Young’s modulus of the carbon coating was measured using
the nano-indenter sNId. Each datum of Young’s modulus was
obtained from the average value of ten times of indentation
on the same sample. Finally, these five samples were im-
mersed in the liquid nitrogen s77 Kd for an hour. After these
fiber samples were taken out of the liquid nitrogen, the bend-
ing radius of the fiber was immediately measured again. In
this step, the temperature change DT was 446 °C.
After the examination of SEM and NI, the thickness and
Young’s modulus of the carbon coating are obtained, respec-
tively. An example of an SEM photograph to demonstrate the
cross section of the optical fiber is shown in Fig. 2. This
figure depicts that the carbon coating is not uniformly depos-
ited on the glass fiber surface. The fiber thicknesses st2 and
t1d with different deposition time are listed in Table I. Table I
depicts that the coating thickness difference st2− t1d is pro-
portional to the deposition time. Meanwhile, NI examination
indicates that Young’s modulus of the carbon coating is
about 108 GPa, in which the variation of Young’s modulus
with the coating thickness is very small and it is negligible.
Notably, when the coating thickness is smaller than 300 nm,
NI examination is not valuable due to the substrate effect.
However, when the coating thickness is larger than 300 nm,
the variation of Young’s modulus with the coating thickness
is very small. As a result, it is believed that the variation of
Young’s modulus with the coating thickness is negligible.
Alternatively, because the ratio of fiber radius and coating
thickness is not less than 84 s=62.5 mm/744 nmd, NI exami-
nation shows that the difference of Young’s modulus be-
tween the carbon coating deposited on the planar substrate
and cylindrical substrate is also small. The fiber bending ra-
dius with different deposition time and temperature change is
also shown in Table I. Table I reveals that the bending radius

Abstract
Carbon coatings are deposited on the outer surface of the glass fiber using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method with
six different hydrogen/methane (H2/CH4) ratios. As a result, the carbon coating structure exhibits a graphitic phase incorporated with a
disordered phase, and the amount of the disordered phase increases with increasing H2/CH4 ratio. On the other hand, the roughness of carbon
coatings decreases with increasing H2/CH4 ratio. If the H2/CH4 ratio is not larger than 2, the tensile strength of carbon-coated optical fibers
increases with increasing H2/CH4 ratio, while the linear density of thermally induced stress voids decreases. Nevertheless, when the H2/CH4
ratio ranges from 2 to 3.33, the tensile strength of carbon-coated optical fibers slightly decreases with the H2/CH4 ratio, and the thermally
induced stress voids are less found on the carbon coating. The method to acquire the high tensile strength of carbon-coated optical fibers and/
or to minimize the thermally induced stress voids on the carbon coating is proposed.

1. Introduction
Optical fibers with low transmission loss and wide
bandwidth have been developed, and many practical
transmission systems use these optical fibers. Long-term
stability is an important requirement for the optical trans-
mission, so optical fibers must maintain the stable perform-
ance in the most severe condition [1]. The conventional
optical fibers for telecommunication are usually constructed
of the silica glass fiber coated with two or three polymer
layers. Silica fibers with polymeric coatings provide high
short-term strengths. However, when these fibers are
stressed in a humid environment, long-term strength
degradation occurs due to the slow crack growth. The use
of hermetic coatings on silica glass fibers can greatly
improve fiber reliability by preventing the mechanical
fatigue, so hermetically coated optical fibers are extensively
studied [2–13]. Some of these fibers exhibit high resistance
to moisture attack, and some of these fibers can withstand
relatively high temperatures.
The carbon material is used as a hermetic optical fiber
coating, and the carbon-coated optical fiber is expected to
be a key technology for optical transmission lines [2–
5,7,12,13]. The coating speed of carbon on the glass fiber
has been increased to a rate sufficient to supply low-cost
fibers for commercial networks [4]. However, in the real
application, the carbon-coated optical fibers must sustain
the mechanical and thermal stresses. Once the mechanical

acquired in Fig. 2(a)–(f), and the graphitic phase peak
position, xG, increases with increasing the H2/CH4 ratio.
Nevertheless, the disordered phase with peak position near
1350~1372cm1 could only be obtained in Fig. 2(c)–(f),
and the peak position of disordered phase, xD, also
increases with increasing the H2/CH4 ratio. It was suggested

maximum strength of the fiber is obtained when the H2/
CH4 ratio is 2. Furthermore, to increase the tensile strength
of carbon-coated optical fibers, the surface roughness, Ra,
of the carbon coating should not exceed 0.783 nm and the
integrated intensity ratio, ID/IG, between disordered phase
and graphitic phase should not exceed 1.233. Notably, the
variation of roughness dominates the change of KI in
carbon-coated optical fibers, so KI variation induced by
E1variation with different carbon coating structure is not
considered here.
Fig. 5 depicts the morphological photograph of the outer
surface of the fiber before immersed in the liquid nitrogen
for 1 day. The outer surfaces of these six fiber samples
before immersed in the liquid nitrogen are very similar,
and therefore, only one picture is depicted here. Fig. 5
shows that the outer surface of the fibers before immersed
in the liquid nitrogen is very smooth, without observable
voids on the outer surface of the carbon coating.
Alternatively, Fig. 6(a)–(f) indicate outer surfaces of the
fibers after immersed in the liquid nitrogen for one day
with the H2/CH4 ratios being 0, 0.67, 1.33, 2, 2.67 and
3.33, respectively. Fig. 6(a)–(c) reveal that the thermally
induced stress voids propagated along the axial direction
on the coating surfaces of fibers are observed, and the
linear density of stress voids decreases with increasing the
H2/CH4 ratio. On the other hand, Fig. 6 (d)–(f) depict that
stress voids are less found when the H2/CH4 ratio is not
smaller than 2. Shiue and Lee [7] indicated that the stress
voids propagated along the axial direction of the fiber were
caused by the thermally induced maximum tangential
stresses. If the thermally induced stress intensity factor
exceeds its critical value, thermally induced stress voids
would occur. The thermally induced maximum tangential
stress on the carbon coating can be obtained from Eq. (11)
of Ref. [7] as
ru Tð Þ ¼ E1DT a1 1þ m1ð Þ  a0 1þ m0ð Þ½ = 1 m21
 
; ð3Þ
where a0 and r0 are, respectively, the thermal expansion
coefficient and Poisson’s ratio of the glass fiber, a1 and m1
are, respectively, the thermal expansion coefficient and
Poisson’s ratio of the carbon coating, and DT is the
temperature change. Fig. 4 also depicts the thermally
induced maximum tangential stress times the square root
of the roughness, ru(T)(Ra)
1/2, in the carbon coating for
these six samples, where a0=0.65106 8C1, m0=0.17,
a1=22106 8C1, m1=0.3, E1=45 GPa and DT=(29877)
K=221 8C. The material parameters of the glass fiber and
carbon coating are again selected from data sheets of
commercial optical fibers and Refs. [7] and [30]. Fig. 4
reveals that the thermally induced stress intensity factor also
decreases with increasing H2/CH4 ratio. Therefore, it is
believed that the decrease of thermally induced stress voids
as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c) resulted in the decrease of the
thermally induced stress intensity factor. On the other hand,
the mechanical strength (or graphitic phase structure) of the
carbon coating decreases in Fig. 6(d)–(f), but the thermally
induced stress intensity factor is still not larger than its
critical stress intensity factor. Therefore, thermally induced
stress voids are less found on the carbon coating surface in
Fig. 6(d)–(f). The above results show that the coating
roughness should not exceed 0.783 nm in the minimization
of the thermally induced stress voids. Notably, the variation
of roughness still dominates the change of the thermally
induced stress intensity factor in carbon-coated optical
fibers, so KI variation induced by E1, a1and m1variation
with different carbon coating structure is not considered
here.
In summary, the ratio between the amount of disordered
phase and graphitic phase increases with increasing H2/
CH4 ratio, while the coating roughness decreases. Fur-
thermore, to increase the tensile strength of the carbon-
coated optical fibers and/or to minimize the thermally
induced stress voids in the carbon coatings, the surface
roughness of the carbon coating should not exceed 0.783
nm and the integrated intensity ratio, ID/IG, between

 Abstract 
 
    The effects of annealing on the properties of hermetically carbon-coated optical 
fibers are investigated. The hermetically carbon-coated optical fibers are prepared by 
the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method using the methane and 
hydrogen as the precursor gases. The annealing temperatures are selected at 100, 200, 
300, 400, and 500°C, respectively. The thickness, optical band gap, and 
microstructure of carbon films are measured. Meanwhile, the water-repellency and 
low-temperature surface morphology of carbon-coated optical fibers are evaluated. 
The results indicate that the thickness and defect content of the carbon films decrease 
with increasing the annealing temperature, while the degree of structure order and the 
amount of microcrystalline graphite in the carbon films increase. When the annealing 
temperature is over 300°C, the carbon films acquire enough thermal energy to cause a 
great amount of hydrogen and hydrocarbon released, and the carbon films transform 
to the graphite-like structure. Additionally, based on the evaluation of 
water-repellency and low-temperature induced break or delamination of carbon films, 
it is found that the carbon film annealed at temperature 300°C is the best one for use 
as the hermetic optical fiber coating.

of this article is to investigate the effects of annealing on the properties of 
hermetically carbon-coated optical fibers prepared by PECVD method. The optimal 
annealing process to fabricate the carbon-coated optical fibers will be proposed.  
 
2. Experimental details 
    The experimental details proceeded as follows. First, the silica glass fiber and 
silica glass plate were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and de-ionized (DI) 
water in sequence to improve the adhesion of carbon films onto these substrates. 
Second, the carbon films were simultaneously deposited on silica glass fibers and 
silica glass plates using a 13.56 MHz radio frequency PECVD system in which a 
cylindrical stainless steel reaction chamber with two parallel planar electrodes was 
employed and the distance between the two electrodes was 3 cm. The bottom of the 
two electrodes was selected as the sample holder. The methane (CH4) and hydrogen 
(H2) were used as the precursor gas, and the flow rates of CH4 and H2 were 9 and 36 
sccm, respectively. The working pressure was kept at 0.12 Torr and the substrate 
temperature was maintained at 25°C. Meanwhile, the plasma power was set at 250 W 
and the substrate bias voltage was 430 V. The deposition time was 30 minutes. Third, 
the carbon films with silica glass fiber substrate and silica glass plate substrate were 
annealed simultaneously in the vacuum (5×10-5 Torr) furnace for 1 h. To avoid oxygen 
etching occurred in the carbon films, the vacuum furnace was purged by argon for 10 
minutes before annealing. The annealing temperatures were selected at 100, 200, 300, 
400, and 500°C, respectively. Fourth, the thicknesses of the carbon films were 
obtained by measuring the cross sections of the fibers using the field emission 
scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Fifth, the optical properties of the carbon 
films were measured with UV/Vis spectrophotometer for wavelength ranging from 
200 to 1100 nm. Sixth, the carbon films microstructure was investigated by Raman

thickness of carbon films decreases if the annealing temperature is not over 300°C. 
This is resulted in the reduction of the defect content in the carbon films at these 
annealing temperatures.16 Alternatively, when the annealing temperature is over 
300°C, the thickness of carbon films strictly decreases. At this annealing temperature, 
the carbon films acquire enough thermal energy to break C-H or C-C bonds, and a 
great amount of hydrogen and hydrocarbon is released.17-23 Hence, the thickness of 
carbon films strictly decreases. 
 
3.2. Optical property 
The optical band gap (Eg) of the carbon films at different annealing temperatures 
is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 depicts that Eg slightly increases from 1.42 to 1.49eV as the 
annealing temperature increases from as-deposited to 300°C. This increase may be 
discussed in terms of unsaturated carbon–carbon and hydrocarbon bonds which form 
dangling bonds in the amorphous material.24 These dangling bonds are responsible for 
the formation of some defects in the carbon films. Such defects produce localized 
states in the band gap of amorphous solids. The energy levels of dangling bonds lie at 
the middle of band gap. During annealing, the unbonding hydrogen atoms of the 
carbon films acquire thermal energy to bond with the unsaturated dangling bonds, 25 
producing larger numbers of saturated bonds. The reduction in the number of 
unsaturated defects decreases the density of localized states in the band structure.26 
Therefore, the dangling bond of the carbon films decreases and hydrocarbon bond of 
the carbon films increases in the structure, which is resulting in the increase of Eg. 
Alternatively, Eg strictly decreases from 1.49 to 0.62eV as the annealing temperature 
increases from 300°C to 500°C. When the annealing temperature is over 300°C, the 
carbon films acquire enough thermal energy to make a great amount of hydrogen and 
hydrocarbon released.17-23 Meanwhile, the residual dangling bonds transform into 
 8
reduce the defect content in the carbon films.16 It also makes a great amount of 
hydrogen and hydrocarbon released, and resulted in increasing the degree of 
graphization structure.17-23 The progressive thermal annealing of the carbon films 
induces graphitization, and promotes growth of the crystallites. Therefore, the number 
of microcrystalline graphite in the structure increases with increasing the annealing 
temperature.28,29 
The FTIR absorption spectra can be employed to monitor the concentration of 
bonded hydrogen. The FTIR absorption spectra relate to C-H bond stretching 
vibration at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 6. It is observed from Fig. 6 
that there is obvious difference in FTIR absorption spectra with increasing the 
annealing temperature. The FTIR absorption spectra can be decomposed into different 
C-H bond. When annealing temperature is below 200°C, there are two peaks at 2859 
cm-1 and 2920 cm-1 which are corresponded to sp3-CH2 symmetric and sp3-CH2 
asymmetric vibrational frequency, respectively. For annealing temperature at 300°C, 
the characteristic peak assigned to sp3-CH3 asymmetric vibrational frequency is 
detected at 2952 cm-1. However, as the annealing temperature is over 300°C, the 
characteristic peak assigned to sp2-CH aromatic vibrational frequency is detected at 
3046 cm-1.17,18,21,30 The increase of the FTIR absorption around 3046 cm-1 is much 
more prominent for annealing temperature at 500°C than other. Therefore, this result 
indicates that graphite-like structure is more easily observed with increasing the 
annealing temperature. 
 
3.4. Water-repellency 
The CA of the silica glass plate is 58°, and the CA of the as-deposited carbon 
film is 70°. This indicates that the carbon film promotes the water-repellency ability 
of the optical fiber. Furthermore, the CA of the carbon films at annealing 
 10
stress at as-deposited. When the carbon coating of the optical fiber is annealed, the 
stress switches from compressive to tensile22,23 and the induced tensile stresses 
between the carbon coating and glass fiber is larger than its adhesive strength. Hence, 
the carbon coating of the optical fiber is delaminated. Alternatively, Figs. 8(a)-(b) 
show that low-temperature induced microcracks occur on the outer surfaces of the 
carbon-coated optical fibers for as-deposited and annealed at temperature 100°C. 
Meanwhile, Figs. 8(c)-(d) depict that less microcracks are found on the outer surfaces 
of the carbon-coated optical fibers as the annealing temperature is at 200°C and 
300°C. This is because the defect content in the structure decreases with increasing 
the annealing temperature.16 As the structure of carbon films becomes more densely, 
which would be better for use to against the low-temperature thermal stresses. When 
the annealing temperature is at 400°C and 500°C, Figs. 7(e)-(f) indicate that the 
carbon films are already delaminated before immersed in liquid nitrogen. Furthermore, 
Figs. 8(e)-(f) reveal that the carbon films are even more seriously delaminated after 
immersed in liquid nitrogen. 
The measured results of water-repellency and surface morphology of carbon 
films show that the carbon film annealed at temperature 300°C is the best one for use 
as the hermetic optical fiber coating. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The effects of annealing on the properties of hermetically carbon-coated optical 
fibers prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method are 
investigated. The results show that the thickness and defect content of the carbon 
films decrease as the annealing temperature increases from as-deposited to 500°C, 
while the degree of structure order and the amount of microcrystalline graphite in the 
carbon films increase. Besides, the color of the carbon-coated optical fibers

polymeric coatings from the glass fibers in double-coated optical fibers

Abstract
To prevent the delamination of polymeric coatings from glass fibers, temperature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stress between the glass fiber
and primary coating should be always smaller than its interfacial shear strength in a long time. The method for the prevention of the long-term
delamination of polymeric coatings from glass fibers is as follows. The thickness of the primary coating can be increased if the spring constant
of the optical fiber is selected to prevent low temperature microbending of the glass fiber. Meanwhile, Poisson’s ratio of the primary coating
should be selected to be very close to 0.5. Alternatively, the relaxation time of the primary coating and secondary coating should be increased, but
Young’s modulus of the primary coating as well as the thermal expansion coefficient of the secondary coating should be decreased. Meanwhile,
the thickness and Young’s modulus of the secondary coating should be decreased if the strength of the secondary coating is satisfied.

1. Introduction
Optical fibers with low transmission loss and wide band-
width have been developed, and are used in many practical
transmission systems. Long-term stability is an important re-
quirement for optical transmission, so optical fibers must main-
tain stable performance in the most severe conditions [1]. Long-
term mechanical strength of optical fibers is achieved by coat-
ing silica glass fibers with polymeric materials during fabri-
cation. The main functions of the polymeric coatings are to
protect the fiber from external damage, abrasion resistance,
static-fatigue protection, and bending insensitivity [2]. How-
ever, the physical properties of silica glass fibers differ from
those of polymeric coatings, so thermal stresses will be built up
at the interface between the glass fiber and the primary coating
after the temperature changes. Compressive and tensile interfa-
cial normal stresses induce microbending loss in the glass fiber

and delamination of the coating, respectively, so both have been
extensively studied [3–7].
Thermally induced shear stress also exists at the interface
between the glass fiber and primary coating. If this interfacial
shear stress exceeds the adhesive strength, the polymeric coat-
ings will be delaminated from the glass fibers and the optical
fiber will thus lose its mechanical strength. Therefore, good
adhesion between the glass fiber and primary coating is nec-
essary to the reliable performance of the fibers. However, large
numbers of optical fibers are assembled in electro-optical de-
vices for communication systems. Before the fibers are con-
nected to a device element, the polymeric coatings must be
removed from the glass fibers [8–11]. If the interfacial shear
strength is too high, stripping the coating materials from the
glass fiber becomes very difficult [12]. Hence, the interfacial
shear strength between the glass fiber and primary coating in
optical fibers must be moderate [13]. Recently, Suhir [14] pro-
posed a polymer-coated optical fiber with a low Young’s mod-
ulus at its ends to prevent the delamination of the polymeric
coatings. Beadle and Jarzynski [15] showed that the delamina-

a = 3E1/[2(1 + ν1)η1], and b = λ2E2/(λη2). In Eq. (4), M =
2n − 1 when 2(n − 1)tp  t  (2n − 1)tp, and M = 2n when
(2n − 1)tp  t  2ntp. Finally, Eq. (3) is transferred from s
space to t space using the Laplace transformation, so that the
interfacial shear stress τmax(t) in the time domain becomes

The ratio of the viscosity coefficient η to Young’s modu-
lus E, of Maxwell materials is called the relaxation time τ , that
is, τ = η/E. The relaxation time is a material property of poly-
meric materials, which can be determined by dynamic mechan-
ical analysis [27]. If τ1 (or η1) and τ2 (or η2) approach infinity,
a polymeric material behaves as an elastic material and the
problem to be solved by viscoelastic theory is reduced to that
solved by elastic theory; that is, Eq. (5) is reduced to Eq. (2).
3. Results
The calculated maximum shear stress τmax(t) as a func-
tion of the time t for n = 1, 100, and 10,000 are displayed in
Figs. 2a–2c, respectively, where tm = t − 2(n − 1)tp. Refer to
previous works [7,20–23], and data sheets of some commercial
polymeric coatings products, the numerical values of parame-
ters are assumed to be r0 = 62.5 µm, r1 = 100 µm, r2 = 125 µm,

and T1 = T2 = 60 ◦C. Notably, the experimental data of
τ1 and τ2 was not available from the literature. Figures 2a–2c
reveal that τmax(t) varies with the temperature cycling. The de-
tails of τmax(t) can be divided into five stages, as follows.
(1) In the first stage [t = 2(n − 1)tp], the temperature drops
from T0 to T2 very quickly, thus creating interfacial shear
stress τmax(t) = −T2(α2 − α0)/(κk).
(2) During the second stage [2(n − 1)tp  t  (2n − 1)tp], the
temperature is kept at T2, the interfacial shear stress τmax(t)
is relaxed owing to the viscoelastic behavior of the poly-
meric coating, and the interfacial shear stress magnitude
decreases with time.
(3) In the third stage [t = (2n − 1)tp], the temperature rises
from T2 to T1 very quickly, thus creating a new interfacial
shear stress τmax(t) = (T1 + T2)(α2 − α0)/(κk).
(4) During the fourth stage [(2n−1)tp  t  2ntp], the temper-
ature is maintained at T1, the interfacial shear stress τmax(t)

is relaxed owing to the viscoelastic behavior of the poly-
meric coating, and the interfacial shear stress magnitude
reduces with time.
(5) In the last stage (t = 2ntp), the temperature drops from T1
to T0 very quickly, thus creating a new interfacial shear
stress τmax(t) = −T1(α2 − α0)/(κk).
In each cycle, the maximum interfacial shear stress at the
low temperature, τL, occurs at the beginning of the second
stage t = t2 = 2(n − 1)tp. Nevertheless, the maximum inter-
facial shear stress at the high temperature, τH, is located at the
beginning of the fourth stage t = t1 = (2n− 1)tp. The tempera-

strongly depends on the physical properties of polymeric coat-
ings, so these interfacial-shear-stresses can be minimized by
a suitable selection of polymeric coatings. However, to min-
imize the temperature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stress
on the glass fibers, the thickness of the primary coating should
be low enough to ensure sufficiently high spring constant of
the elastic foundation to prevent low temperature microbend-
ing of the glass fiber [28]. After the fundamental requirement
for the spring constant of the primary coating is satisfied, the
thickness of the primary coating should be increased to mini-
mize these interfacial shear stresses. Meanwhile, Poisson’s ratio
of the primary coating should be also increased. It means that
Poisson’s ratio of the primary coating should be selected very
close to 0.5. Alternatively, Young’s modulus of the primary
coating should be decreased, while the relaxation time of the
primary coating should be increased. The secondary coating
of a double-coated optical fiber must sustain the external me-
chanical stresses, and therefore it must have sufficient thickness
and higher Young’s modulus. After the fundamental require-
ment for the mechanical strength of the secondary coating is
satisfied, the thickness and Young’s modulus of the secondary
coating should be decreased as small as possible to minimize
these interfacial-shear-stresses. Alternatively, the effective ther-
mal expansion coefficient of the secondary coating should be
decreased, while the relaxation time of the secondary coating
should be increased.
4. Discussion
The delamination of polymer coatings from the glass fiber is
strongly dependent on the interfacial shear strength between the
glass fiber and primary coating as mentioned above. If the tem-
perature cycling induced maximum interfacial-shear-stress ex-
ceeds its interfacial shear strength, the polymeric coatings will
be delaminated from the glass fibers and the optical fiber will
thus lose its mechanical strength. Recently, Shiue [29] proposed
a method to determine the interfacial shear strength between the
glass fiber and primary coating from the mechanical strip force.
Using Shiue’s method, Shen and co-workers [30] examined
the degradation of interfacial shear strength, τa(t), for a com-
mercialized double-coated optical fibers. In their work [30],
the fiber was put in a closed chamber with temperature 25 ◦C
and relatively humidity 85% in different time. The mechan-
ical stripping rate was set at 5 mm/min, and each τa(t) was
taken from the average value of 50 samples. The measured re-
sults showed that τa(t) is equal to 8.73, 6.81, 4.90, 3.90, 4.25,
3.52, 3.30, 3.47, and 3.77 MPa for t = 1 h, 24 h (= 1 day),
48 h (= 2 days), 72 h (= 3 days), 84 h (= 7 days), 168 h
(= 14 days), 504 h (= 21 days), 672 h (= 28 days), and 840 h
(= 35 days), respectively. This degradation of the interfacial
shear strength could be expressed by the following formula:
τa(t) = A + Be−(2t/C), where A = 3.59 MPa, B = 5.41 MPa,
and C = 72.6 h, respectively. It was also found that if t < C,

E11, ν11, and τ11 represent Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio,
and the relaxation time, respectively, of the primary coating at
temperature T1, and E12, ν12, and τ12 denote Young’s modulus,
Poisson’s ratio, and relaxation time, respectively, of the primary
coating at temperature T2. Although the physical properties of
primary coatings at temperature T1 differ from those at temper-
ature T2, the guide rule for the selection of the primary coating
to minimize interfacial shear stress during the temperature cy-
cling remains unaltered. Alternatively, if the glass transition
temperature of the secondary coating is included in the tem-
perature change range, Eq. (5) should be replaced with

Here E21, α21, and τ21 represent Young’s modulus, effective
thermal expansion coefficient, and the relaxation time, respec-
tively, of the secondary coating at temperature T1, and E22,
α22, and τ22 denote the Young’s modulus, effective thermal
expansion coefficient, and relaxation time, respectively, of the
secondary coating at temperature T2. Although the physical
properties of secondary coatings at temperature T1 differ from
those at temperature T2, the guide rule for the selection of the
secondary coating to minimize interfacial shear stress during
the temperature cycling also remains unaltered. Notably, if the
glass transition temperatures of the primary coating and sec-
ondary coatings are simultaneously included in the temperature
change range, the analysis method is similar to the above dis-
cussion.
5. Conclusions
The temperature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stresses
between the glass fiber and primary coating in double-coated
optical fibers have been examined in a long time. If the tem-
perature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stress between the
glass fiber and the primary coating exceeds the interfacial shear
strength, then the coatings will be delaminated. The method for
minimizing these shear stresses is as follows. The thickness
of the primary coating can be increased if the spring constant
of the optical fiber is selected to prevent low temperature mi-
crobending of the glass fiber. Meanwhile, Poisson’s ratio of
the primary coating should be selected to be very close to 0.5.
Alternatively, Young’s modulus of the primary coating should
be decreased, while the relaxation time of the primary coating
should be increased. The thickness and Young’s modulus of the
secondary coating can be decreased so long as the requirement
on the strength of the secondary coating is satisfied. The ther-
mal expansion coefficient of the secondary coating should be
decreased, while the relaxation time of the secondary coating
should be increased.

Abstract
The dependence of the interfacial shear strength between the glass fiber and primary coating in double-coated optical fibers on humidity and
temperature is experimentally investigated. The interfacial shear strength is determined from the mechanical stripping force. The effect of humidity
on the interfacial shear strength is governed by the diffusion of water vapor through the polymeric coatings to the interface between the glass fiber
and primary coating. After several days, the diffusion of water vapor reaches a steady state. The degradation of the interfacial shear strength is
unrelated to the total amount of water vapor in the polymeric coatings, does depend on the amount of water vapor on the glass/polymer interface.
Consequently, the degradation of interfacial shear strength caused by the humidity is proportional to the squared cube-root of the water vapor
pressure. Results of this study demonstrate that the relationship between the fiber strength and the humidity resembles that between the interfacial
shear strength and the humidity.

1. Introduction
Long-term stability is an important requirement for optical
transmission, so the stable performance of optical fiber must be
maintained under the most severe conditions. The silica glass
fibers are typically coated with two layers of UV curable acry-
late during fabrication to maintain their mechanical strength.
The inner, primary coating has a lower modulus than the outer,
secondary coating. These coatings reduce microbending loss;
protect the glass surface from handling damage, and can affect
the rate of attachment of chemicals to the surface [1]. In real
applications, thermal and mechanical loads are applied to the
optical fiber, so a shear stress exists at the interface between the
glass fiber and the primary coating. If this shear stress exceeds
the interfacial shear strength, then the adhesive bond between the
glass fiber and primary coating will be broken. Consequently, the
polymeric coatings are delaminated from the glass fibers, and

the mechanical strength of the optical fiber is greatly reduced
[2–5]. Therefore, good adhesion between the glass fiber and pri-
mary coating is required to ensure the reliable performance of
the fibers. Nevertheless, many optical fibers are assembled in
electro-optical devices for communication systems. Before the
fibers are connected to a device element, the polymeric coatings
must be removed from the glass fibers [6–8]. If the interfacial
shear strength is too high, stripping the coating materials from
the optical fiber is extremely difficult [9]. Hence, moderate inter-
facial shear strength between the glass fiber and primary coating
is adopted for most of the fibers [10].
The tensile strength of silica glass fibers may degrade in harsh
environments, and the degradation of the fiber strength depends
strongly on the activity of water at the glass fiber/primary coating
interface [11–18]. Water vapor at the glass fiber/primary coating
interface is believed to degrade the interfacial shear strength.
If the interfacial shear strength degrades, then delamination of
polymeric coatings from glass fibers may occur in a long time.
Consequently, the effect of humidity and temperature on the
long-term shear strength between the glass fiber and polymeric
coating in the optical fibers must be understood. In this study, the

about 2/3. This experimental evidence demonstrates that the
degradation of the interfacial shear strength is unrelated to
the total amount of water vapor in the polymeric coatings,
but is sensitive to the amount of water vapor on the glass
fiber/primary coating interface. Consequently, [τ0(T) − τf(T)]

considered. Many of these coated fibers show low strength (3.5 to 4 GPa) but high
resistance to moisture attack. Alternatively, metallic coatings [6–13] such as aluminum,
indium, tin, antimony, zinc, lead, copper, nickel, and gold are also applied on optical
fibers. Some of these fibers exhibit high resistance to moisture attack and significantly
higher strength than those of polymer-coated fibers, and some of these fibers can withstand
relatively high temperatures.
Thermally and mechanically induced stresses are important in the conventional
polymer-coated optical fibers, so they have been extensively studied [14–16]. For ex-
ample, transmission losses of polymer-coated optical fibers increase at a low temper-
ature, which is caused by the stresses due to the thermal contraction mismatches of
polymeric coatings and the glass fiber [14, 15]. Alternatively, the hydrostatic pressure–
induced stresses also result in an increase of transmission losses in the polymer-coated
optical fibers [15, 16]. As a result, thermal stresses in hermetically carbon-coated [17–19],
metal-coated [20, 21], and double-coated [22] optical fibers were subsequently studied,
and the effect of hermetic coatings on thermal stresses in these optical fibers was pro-
posed. However, no work was addressed on the pressure-induced stresses in hermetically
double-coated optical fibers. This study investigates the method to minimize the hydro-
static pressure–induced stresses in hermetically double-coated optical fibers. The effects
of material’s properties of hermetic coatings (including Young’s modulus and Poisson’s
ratio) and their thickness on the stresses are first studied, and then the hydrostatic–pressure
induced stresses in optical fibers with some selected metallic coatings are considered. Fi-
nally, the hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses in the hermetically double-coated optical
fibers are compared to those in hermetically single-coated optical fibers.
II. Analysis
Figure 1 depicts the problem. The hydrostatic pressure p0 is acted on the outer surface
of a hermetically double-coated optical fiber which is constructed of a glass fiber coated
with two layers of hermetic materials. In this study, a cylindrical coordinate system
(r, θ, z) is adopted, and the fiber’s half length is L. Symbols r , E, and ν represent the
radius, Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio, respectively, and the subscripts 0, 1, and 2
indicate the glass fiber, the primary coating, and the secondary coating, respectively. The
stresses in the hermetically double-coated optical fibers can be approximately obtained
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of a hermetically double-coated optical fiber.
426 S.-T. Shiue et al.
Figure 2. The stress distribution of σr , σθ , and σz in a hermetically double-coated optical fiber arise
from the hydrostatic pressure p0, where r0 = 62.5 µm, r1 = 65 µm, r2 = 75 µm, E0 = 72.5 GPa,
E1 = 150 GPa, E2 = 100 GPa, ν0 = 0.3, ν1 = 0.3, ν2 = 0.3, L = 50 mm, and z = 0.
r2 = 75 µm, E0 = 72.5 GPa, E1 = 150 GPa, E2 = 100 GPa, ν0 = 0.3, ν1 = 0.3,
ν2 = 0.3, L = 50 mm, and z = 0. The parameters of this optical fiber are selected from
Cherin [25] and Brandes [26]. Figure 2 shows that the radial stress σr(z) is a compressive
stress. The magnitude of the radial stress equals p1 max in the glass fiber increases from
p1 max (at r = r0) to p2 max (at r = r1) in the primary coating, and continuously increases
from p2 max (at r = r1) to p0 (at r = r2) in the secondary coating. The radial stresses are
continuous at the interfaces of the glass fiber and the hermetic coatings. The tangential
stress σθ (z) is also a compressive stress. The magnitude of the tangential stress equals
p1 max in the glass fiber and decreases with increasing the radial distance in the primary
coating and the secondary coating. The tangential stresses at the interfaces of the glass
fiber and the hermetic coatings are discontinuing. The axial stress σz(z) is a tensile stress
in the glass fiber, but it is a compressive stress in the primary coating and the secondary
coating. Figure 2 also indicates that the maximum normal stress in the primary coating
is the tangential stress at the interface between the glass fiber and the primary coating,
and its magnitude is:

r21 − r20

r21 − r20
(4a)
Alternatively, the maximum normal stress in the secondary coating is the tangential
stress at the interface between the primary coating and the secondary coating, and its
magnitude is:
σ2 max = −p2 max(r

coatings of optical fibers are used as the water barrier to ensure the fiber’s long-term
strength, so they should never be failed. Figure 3 shows that all the stresses decrease
with increasing r1. Figure 5 depicts that besides σ1 max decreases with decreasing E1, the
other stresses decrease with increasing E1, if E1 > 25 GPa. Figure 6 reveals that besides
σ2 max decreases with decreasing E2, the other stresses decrease with increasing E2. A
metallic coating with high Young’s modulus also has high tensile strength to sustain
the maximum normal stress. Consequently, the hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses can
be minimized as follows. The radius and Young’s modulus of the primary coating, and
Young’s modulus of the secondary coating should be increased. Meanwhile, the maximum
normal stresses in the hermetic coatings and interfacial shear stresses between the glass
fiber and the primary coating should be smaller than their corresponding tensile strengths
and shear strengths, respectively.
IV. Discussion
The calculated values of hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses in hermetically double-
coated optical fibers with some selected metallic coatings are depicted in Table 1, to
know hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses in the practical optical fibers. The material’s
properties of these selected metallic coatings are also shown in this table [26]. With
the exception of material’s properties of the specified metallic coating, the parameters of
optical fibers are assumed to be the same as those shown in Figure 2, and p0 = 100 MPa.
First, if these metallic coatings are selected as the primary coatings, Table 1 shows that
(1) lead and indium possess the lowest Young’s moduli and the highest Poisson’s ratios,
so lead and indium induce the highest τ1 max and T0 max. Alternatively, because chromium
owns the highest Young’s modulus and the lowest Poisson’s ratio, chromium induce the
lowest τ1 max and T0 max; (2) the variation of p1 max and σ2 max with these metallic coatings
is small; and (3) lead and indium have the lowest Young’s moduli, so lead and indium
produce the lowest σ1 max. Nevertheless, chromium owns the highest Young’s modulus,
so chromium induces the highest σ1 max. Second, if these metallic coatings are selected
as the secondary coatings, Table 1 indicates that (1) lead and indium possess the highest
Poisson’s ratios and the lowest Young’s moduli, so lead and indium induce the highest
τ1 max and T0 max. Nevertheless, because chromium has the highest Young’s modulus and
lowest Poisson’s ratio, chromium produces the lowest τ1 max and T0 max. Notably, the
axial force T0 max exerted on the glass fiber in the chromium-coated optical fiber is a
tensile force, so T0 max is negative. A tensile axial force would not induce the buckling
of the fiber; (2) because lead and indium have the lowest Young’s modulus, lead and
indium produce the highest p1 max. Alternatively, chromium owns the highest Young’s
modulus, so chromium induces the lowest P1 max; (3) the variation of σ1 max with these
metallic coatings is small; and (4) because lead and indium possess the lowest Young’s
moduli, lead and indium induce the lowest σ2 max. Alternatively, because chromium has
the highest Young’s modulus, chromium induces the highest σ2 max. Notably, although
chromium induces the highest normal stress, it also has the highest tensile strength to
sustain the hydrostatic pressure induced normal stress. In summary, chromium has the
best performance in the minimization of hydrostatic pressure induced stresses. However,
lead and indium are the poor materials.
It is worthy to mention that if r2 equals r1, the problem is reduced to that of her-
metically single-coated optical fibers [27]. Assume that the parameters of the primary
coating in hermetically double-coated optical fibers are the same as those in hermetically
432 S.-T. Shiue et al.
single-coated optical fibers, the hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses in the double-coated
optical fibers are compared to those in the single-coated optical fibers. One finds that
τ1 max and T0 max in the double-coated optical fibers are larger than those in the single-
coated optical fibers. It is implied that the hermetic coatings of double-coated optical
fibers are easily to be delaminated from the glass fibers comparing to those of single-
coated optical fibers, and double-coated optical fibers will produce larger buckling in-
duced bending losses than those of single-coated optical fibers. Alternatively, p1 max and
σ1 max in the double-coated optical fibers are smaller than those in the single-coated
optical fibers. It is implied that the secondary coating minimizes the compressive ra-
dial stress–induced microbending losses and also reduces the breaking probability of the
primary coating.
Although the hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses in hermetically double-coated
optical fibers are investigated in this study, there are still two important problems worthy
to mention here. The first one is that the optical fiber is under point loading. Generally,
if the optical fiber is under point loading, the point loading–induced radial stresses can
be approximately assumed to be the same as that caused by the hydrostatic pressure.
Nevertheless, the point loading–induced shear stress and axial force can be neglected.
The second issue is that the fiber is under small bending. Fiber can easily be bent in
operation or during installation and in doing so can develop 200,000 or 300,000 psi
(1.4 to 2.0 GPa) at its outside diameter, which is roughly equivalent to 3.5% elongation.
However, because the mathematical derivation of optical fiber under smaller bending is
quite different from that of under hydrostatic pressure (this study), the problem of optical
fiber under small bending will be considered in the further work. Notably, the interfacial
bonding between the coating and the glass fiber will affect the delamination of coatings
and the fracture of glass fibers, so the specialist should pay more efforts to study the
interfacial phenomenon between the glass fiber and the coating.
V. Conclusions
The design of hermetically double-coated optical fibers to minimize hydrostatic pressure
induced stresses is investigated. Although the approach described here is less rigorous
than the exact theory-of-elasticity treatment, it enables one to obtain easy-to-use and
sufficiently accurate solutions. Some important results are described as follows:
(1) The stresses in the hermetically double-coated optical fibers are proportional to
the hydrostatic pressure, and they are a function of the material’s properties of
the hermetic coatings and their thicknesses. Several stresses are important in the
optical fibers. First, the interfacial shear stress τ1 max between the glass fiber and
primary coating may exceed its shear strength and results in the delamination
of hermetic coatings from the glass fiber. Second, the compressive radial stress
at the interface between the glass fiber and primary coating would produce
the microbending loss. Thirdly, the normal stress in the hermetic coating may
exceed its tensile strength and induces the break of hermetic coatings. Finally,
the compressive axial force in the glass fiber would induce the buckling of fibers
and also results in an increase of bending loss.
(2) The hydrostatic pressure–induced stresses can be reduced by appropriately se-
lecting material’s properties of hermetic coatings and their thicknesses. To mini-
mize these stresses, the radius and Young’s modulus of the primary coating, and
Young’s modulus of the secondary coating should be increased. Meanwhile, the

Appendix
Figure 1 depicts the problem. The hydrostatic pressure p0 is acted on the outer surface
of a hermetically double-coated optical fiber constructed of a glass fiber coated with two
layers of hermetic materials. A cylindrical coordinate system (r, θ, z) is adopted, and
the fiber’s half length is L. Symbols r , E, and ν represent the radius, Young’s modulus,
and Poisson’s ratio, respectively, and the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 indicate the glass fiber,
the primary coating, and the secondary coating, respectively. Alternatively, symbols w
and u represent the axial and radial displacements, respectively, and the subscripts 01,

pressure p0, respectively. λ0 = 1/(E0πr20 ), λ1 = 1/[E1π(r21 − r20 )], and λ2 = 1/
[E2π(r22 − r21 )] represent the axial compliances with respect to the axial forces, and
γi = νiλi (i = 0, 1, 2) indicate the radial compliances with respect to the axial forces.
Based on the force equilibrium, the axial forces T0(z), T1(z), and T2(z) can be
replaced by the shear stresses τ1(z) and τ2(z) as
T0(z) = 2πr0

Because both ends of the optical fiber are the free tractions, the following boundary
conditions should be satisfied:
T0(L) = T0(−L) = T1(L) = T1(−L) = T2(L) = T2(−L) = 0 (A3)
Conditions for the compatibilities of interfacial displacements between the glass
fiber and the primary coating, as well as the primary coating and the secondary coating
require that w01 = w11, w12 = w22, u01 = u11, and u12 = u22. Consequently, four basic

Abstract 
The effect of coating thickness and roughness on water-repellency and thermally induced 
cracks in copper-coated optical fibers is investigated. Seven samples of copper-coated optical fibers 
with identical fiber length but different coating thickness are prepared using electroless plating 
method. The thicknesses of copper coatings are 62, 89, 127, 154, 165, 206 and 251 nm, respectively. 
Atomic force microscope measurement reveals that the roughness of copper coating increases with 
increasing coating thickness. It is found that if coating thickness is less than 89 nm, water contact 
angle slightly increases with increasing coating thickness, while the thermally induced cracks are 
less found in copper coatings. Nevertheless, if coating thickness is in the range of 89 to 251 nm, 
water contact angle decreases with increasing coating thickness, while the number of thermally 
induced cracks increases with increasing coating thickness. To get a high water-repellency and low 
thermally induced cracks in copper-coated optical fibers, surface roughness of copper coating 
should be diminished.

et al., 2002; Kwok and Chiu, 2003; Shiue et al., 2005a; Nozawa et al., 1992; Bogatyrjov et al., 1996; 
Griscom et al., 1996; Seo et al., 1998; Shiue and Lin, 1998; Shiue et al., 2000; Shiue et al., 2005b). 
Electroless plating method is extensively used in surface coating process, and electroless plating of 
copper metals is proven to possess many advantages such as plating without applied current, low 
tool cost, low processing temperature, high electric conductivity and high fatigue-resistance (Pai 
and Ting, 1989; Shacham-Diamanda et al., 1995; Patterson et al., 1995; Shacham-Diamanda and 
Lopatin, 1999). As a result, electroless plating method is adopted to prepare copper-coated optical 
fibers in this study. Hermetic properties of copper-coated optical fibers can be evaluated by contact 
angle of water on copper coatings. A larger water contact angle on coating material implies that the 
coating material possesses a higher water-repellency and also a good hermetic property (Tan et al., 
2005). Alternatively, once the thermally induced cracks occur in copper coating at a low 
temperature, hermetically copper-coated optical fibers will lose their prevention of mechanical 
fatigue. Hence, the purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of coating thickness and 
roughness on water-repellency and thermally induced cracks in copper-coated optical fibers. 
Copper-coated optical fibers with seven different coating thicknesses are prepared using electroless 
plating method. Roughness and structure of copper coatings are measured, and then, water contact 
angle and thermally induced cracks in these copper-coated optical fibers are examined. 
 
2. Experimental details 
Experiment proceeded as follows. First, polymeric layers of a standard double-coated optical 
fiber were removed by 200 oC hot sulfuric acid. Outside diameter of silica glass fiber is 125 μm. 
Second, copper materials were deposited on the outer surface of glass fiber using electroless plating 
method. Generally, pre-treatments of electroless plating method include conditioning, sensitization 
and activation process. Because silica glass fiber is a brittle material, conditioning treatment may 
create some cracks on fiber surfaces. As a result, pre-treatments include only sensitization and 
activation process in this experiment. Optimal electroless plating condition was obtained by trial 
and error to acquire a mostly smooth coating surface. Optimal condition for electroless plating

differ, thermal stresses will build up after a temperature drop ΔT. The thermal stresses in 
hermetically coated optical fibers had been analyzed in reference (Shiue and Lee, 1997). Based on 
this reference, thermally induced maximum radial stress σr(T), maximum tangential stress σθ(T) and 
maximum axial stress σz(T) in copper coating can be represented as 
 
σr(T)=ΔΤ [α1(1+ν1)–α0(1+ν0)]/{[(1+ν0)(1–2ν0)/E0]+(1+ν1)(r12–2ν1r02+r02)/[E1(r12–r02)]}, (1a) 
 
σθ(T)=σr(T)(r12+r02)/(r12–r02),             (1b) 
 
σz(T)=(α1–α0)ΔΤ E0E1 r02/[E0r02+E1(r12–r02)].         (1c) 
 
Notably, although σr(T) is a compressive stress, σθ(T) and σz(T) are tensile stresses. To reveal the 
effect of coating thickness on these stresses, Fig. 2 displays the magnitudes of stresses σr(T), σθ(T) 
and σz(T) versus (r1–r0), where r0=62.5 μm, E0=72.5 GPa, E1=130 GPa, α0=0.56×10–6 K–1, 
α1=17.0×10–6 K–1, ν0=0.17, ν1=0.34 and ΔT=(298-77) K=221 K. In this study, Young’s modulus of 
copper coating was measured by nano-indenter, while the other material parameters of glass fiber 
and copper coating were selected from references (Shiue et al., 2003) and (Brandes, 1983). This 
figure depicts that σθ(T) and σz(T) decrease with increasing (r1–r0), but the magnitude of σr(T) 
increases with increasing (r1–r0). If the thickness of copper coating is fixed, thermally induced 
maximum tangent and axial stresses greatly exceed thermally induced maximum radial stress. 
Therefore, the effect of radial stress σr(T) on thermally induced cracks can be neglected. 
 
4. Results and discussion 
After examination of SEM, AFM and GID, the thickness, roughness and structure of these 
coating samples are obtained. SEM observation shows that the copper coatings are uniformly 
deposited on glass fiber surface, and thicknesses of these seven samples are 62, 89, 127, 154, 165, 
206 and 251nm, respectively. Fig. 3 is an example of SEM photograph to demonstrate the cross 
 7
observable cracks in copper coating. Nevertheless, Figs. 5(c)-(f) reveal that if coating thicknesses 
are in the range of 89 to 165 nm, number of thermally induced cracks increases with increasing 
coating thickness. Thermally induced cracks look like an array of short microcracks along the axial 
direction. It is believed that these cracks are induced by maximum tangential stresses. Alternatively, 
Figs. 5(g)-(h) display that if coating thickness is in the range of 206 to 251 nm, thermally induced 
bigger-cracks and inclined-cracks appear on fiber surface. In summary, Figs. 5(b)-(h) depict that the 
number of thermally induced cracks increases with increasing coating thickness. 
In fracture mechanics, a surface crack with length c locally amplifies the mode I applied stress 
σa, producing a stress intensity factor KI given by 
 
KI = Y σa c1/2,                                      (2) 
 
where Y denotes a parameter describing the crack shape and loading geometry. When KI exceeds 
critical stress intensity factor KIC, crack grows catastrophically and failure occurs. Intuitively, a 
rough surface creates a large surface crack length. Hence, c given in Eq. (2) can be replaced by Ra 
to estimate failure of copper coatings. Using the data shown in Fig. 2 and Table II, Fig. 6 depicts 
thermal stress times the square root of roughness with different coating thickness. Fig. 6 reveals that 
thermally induced stress intensity factor also increases with increasing coating thickness. All the 
seven samples are prepared by same plating condition and KIC, is a material property, so it is 
reasonable to assume that critical stress intensity factor is independent of coating thickness. It is 
difficult to quantitatively define the exact value of critical stress intensity factor of copper coating in 
this study. Nevertheless, it is believed that the increase of thermally induced cracks is resulted in the 
increase of thermally induced stress intensity factor. Therefore, surface roughness of copper coating 
should be decreased to minimize these thermally induced cracks. In general, Eq. (2) is only valid for 
uniform uniaxial loading perpendicular to an isolate crack. However, in order to obtain some 
insights, it is assumed that cracks and stress components do not interact with each other in this 
study.

1. Introduction 
Recently, various properties of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films have been 
found, such as wide band gap, high hardness, inert chemical attack, infrared 
transparency, and high water resistance.1,2 Many researches successfully applied DLC 
films to the commercial applications such as hard disk, frictional resistance films, 
protective optical materials, biomedical products, and so on. Meanwhile, the excellent 
properties of DLC films have been also applied to become hermetic coatings of 
optical fibers and the carbon-coated optical fiber is expected to be a key technology 
for optical transmission lines.3-10 
Preparation of DLC films can be carried out at a low substrate temperature and 
high deposition rate using various methods, such as radio-frequency plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (rf-PECVD),7,10-12 plasma enhanced chemical vapor 
deposition with electron cyclotron wave resonance source,13 microwave plasma 
chemical vapor deposition,14 sputtering deposition,15 filtered cathodic vacuum arc 
deposition,16 and ion beam deposition.17 It was reported that the rf-PECVD process is 
a simple method to prepare the carbon-coated optical fibers at a low temperature.7,10 
When the carbon films are prepared by rf-PECVD method, the characteristics of 
carbon films are affected by many factors such as the mixture ratio of reactive gases, 
self-bias voltage, and so on.10,18-20 However, no work was found to study the effect of 
argon/methane (Ar/CH4) ratios on the properties of carbon-coated optical fibers 
prepared by rf-PECVD method. Hence, the purpose of this article is to investigate the 
influence of Ar/CH4 ratios on the characteristics of carbon-coated optical fibers. 
Additionally, the optimal Ar/CH4 ratio to fabricate the carbon-coated optical fibers 
will be proposed. 
 
2. Experimental details

1250-3600 cm-1 with 128 scans at resolution of 1 cm-1. Fourthly, the optical band gap 
of carbon films was measured by UV/Vis spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-3010) for 
wavelength ranging from 200 to 1100 nm with a bare silica glass plate at the reference 
beam to eliminate the substrate contribution. Fifthly, the mechanical property of 
carbon coatings was measured by the nanoindenter (NI, UMIS Nanoindentation, 
Based Model, CRISO, Australia). In each of indentation experiment, the indenter was 
loaded and unloaded three times at the maximum penetration depth less than 10% of 
the film thickness. Sixthly, the roughness of carbon coatings was examined by the 
atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instrument NS4/D3100CL/MultiMode). The 
value of surface roughness, Ra, was estimated by tapping mode method and was 
evaluated in the area of 5×5 μm. Each datum was obtained from the average value of 
three different positions on the same specimen surface. Meanwhile, the 
water-repellency of carbon coatings was measured by contact angle (CA) meter with 
sessile-drop technique. A DI water droplet with a volume of 2μl was released onto the 
surface of the sample from a syringe needle. Each measurement was repeated 10 
times and reproducibility was never worse than ±1o. Finally, the carbon-coated 
optical fibers were immersed in liquid nitrogen for one day to verify the 
low-temperature performance of carbon coatings. To examine whether the carbon 
coatings on the optical fibers were broken or delaminated, the outer surfaces of the 
carbon-coated optical fibers before and after immersion in liquid nitrogen for one day 
were observed using optical microscope (OM). Notably, the thickness and the outer 
surface of carbon films were measured using the samples with silica glass fiber 
substrates. Nevertheless, the other properties of carbon films were measured using the 
samples with silica glass plate substrates.

(ωG) increases. On the other hand, if the Ar/CH4 ratio is over 4, the ωD, FWHMD, 
FWHMG, and ID/IG increase as the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 4 to 8, while the ωG 
decreases. According to the analytic results of Raman spectra, if the Ar/CH4 ratio 
changes from 0 to 4, the number of ordered sp2 sites in the carbon coating structure 
increases with the increase of ωG and the decrease of ωD, FWHMD, and FWHMG.25-26 
On the other hand, if the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 4 to 8, the number of disordered 
sp2 sites in the carbon coating structure increases with the decrease of ωG and the 
increase of ωD, FWHMD, and FWHMG.25-26 Moreover, it is known that ID/IG varies 
inversely with the crystalline size of graphite.22,27-28 As a result, if the Ar/CH4 ratio 
changes from 0 to 4, the crystalline size of the graphite should increase with the 
decrease of ID/IG. On the other hand, if the Ar/CH4 ratio changes from 4 to 8, the 
crystalline size of the graphite should reduce gradually as the ID/IG increases. 
The FTIR spectra can be also used to identify the nature of bonding (C-Hx and 
C-C stretching modes) in the carbon coatings. Figure 3 illustrates FTIR spectra of 
carbon coatings prepared at different Ar/CH4 ratio. In the C-H stretching bonds 
ranging from 2800 to 3100 cm-1, two significant peaks at 2855 and 2920 cm-1 are 
found in all of spectra, which represent the sp3-CH2 symmetric and sp3-CH2 
asymmetric bonds, respectively.2,29 Figure 3 shows that the peak intensity at 2855 and 
2920 cm-1 and the integrated peak area in the region of 2800 and 3100 cm-1 decrease 
with increasing the Ar/CH4 ratio. In the other FTIR absorbance band ranging from 
1300 to 2000 cm-1, four significant peaks at 1415, 1450, 1580, and 1640 cm-1 are 
appeared. The two peaks at 1415 and 1450 cm-1 represent the olefinic sp2-CH2 and 
sp3-CH2 asymmetric stretching modes, respectively; the other two peaks at 1580 and 
1640 cm-1 indicate the aromatic and olefinic sp2 C=C stretching modes, respectively.2 
When the Ar/CH4 ratio increases, the CHx modes, located at 1415 and 1450 cm-1, 
decrease gradually. However, the sp2 C=C bonds, appearing at 1580 and 1640 cm-1, 
 9
and Young’s modulus of carbon coatings also slightly increases from 70.0 to 73.9 GPa. 
Notably, the measured Young’s modulus Er is usually not the exact Young’s modulus 
Es of coating materials. The measured Young’s modulus Er can be expressed as 
 
1/Er=[(1-νs2)/Es]+[(1-νi2)/Ei],                                       (2) 
 
where Ei is Young’s modulus of the indenter, and νs and νi are Possion’s ratios of the 
sample and indenter, respectively. Because Ei is much larger than Es, the last term 
(1-νi2)/Ei on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) can be omitted. On the other hand, νs is 
commonly smaller than 0.3 for most of the coating materials.31 Therefore, the 
measured Young’s modulus is close to Young’s modulus of the sample. 
 
3.4 Surface roughness and water-repellency 
Figure 6 shows the relationship between average surface roughness Ra of carbon 
coatings and the Ar/CH4 ratios. Ra decreases from 0.43 to 0.34 nm with increasing the 
Ar/CH4 ratio from 0 to 4. On the other hand, as the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 4 to 8, 
Ra increases rapidly from 0.34 to 0.55 nm. Notably, when the Ar/CH4 ratio is between 
0 and 1, Ra of carbon coatings is almost the same and the value of Ra varies only 
within 0.02 nm. 
Figure 6 also indicates the relationship between the water CA of carbon coatings 
and the Ar/CH4 ratio. Figure 6 indicates that if the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 0 to 4, 
the water CA increases from 78.0o to 81.5o. Alternatively, the water CA decreases 
from 81.5 to 79.1o with increasing the Ar/CH4 ratio from 4 to 8. It is worthy to 
mention that the water CA of carbon coatings for all Ar/CH4 ratios is larger than the 
water CA of silica glass plate, which is about 58o. The relationship between surface 
roughness and contact angle had been developed by Wenzel32, and it is given as: 
 11
optical fibers becomes more conspicuous as the Ar/CH4 ratio changes from 0 to 2. If 
the Ar/CH4 ratio is 4, the carbon coating without any microcracks is observed as 
depicted in Fig. 8d. With increasing the Ar/CH4 ratio from 6 to 8, the strictly damaged 
carbon coatings are revealed as illustrated in Figs. 8e-8f. Based on the above results, it 
is found that if the Ar/CH4 ratio is 4, the carbon coating has the best adhesion to 
sustain the thermal loading. 
 
4. Discussion 
According to the above investigation, it is known that if the Ar/CH4 ratio 
increases from 0 to 4, the ωD, FWHMD, FWHMG, ID/IG, Eg, hardness, Young’s 
modulus, and surface roughness decrease, while the ωG and water CA increase. On the 
other hand, if the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 4 to 8, the ωD, FWHMD, FWHMG, ID/IG, 
Eg, hardness, Young’s modulus, and surface roughness increase, while the ωG and 
water CA decrease. Consequently, the results of Raman spectra, Eg, hardness, Young’s 
modulus, Ra and water CA have a turning point at the Ar/CH4 ratio equaling 4. 
Alternatively, based on the results of FTIR spectra, the number of hydrocarbon bonds 
in the carbon coating reduces with increasing the Ar/CH4 ratio from 0 to 8, while the 
olefinic and aromatic sp2 C=C bonds increase. In order to know the coating structure 
in detail, the deposition mechanism at different Ar/CH4 ratio must be described first. 
The deposition process of carbon coatings at different Ar/CH4 ratio is actually a 
competition of the penning effect and etching effect.18,33 Both penning effect and 
etching effect increase with increasing the Ar/CH4 ratio. When the Ar/CH4 ratio is 
between 0 and 4, the penning effect is more obvious than the etching effect. The 
penning effect during process enhances the complete dissociation of the hydrocarbon 
gas molecules. This fact results in the decrease of hydrocarbon bonds in the carbon 
coating, and the sp2 sites should present as the olefinic and aromatic sp2 C=C bonding 
 13
81.5o, so the result of this work is better than that of our pervious work. 
Notably, it is difficult to measure the RSS, FTIR, Eg, NI, Ra and water CA of 
carbon coatings using the samples with silica glass fiber substrates, so these properties 
of carbon coatings are measured using the samples with silica glass plate substrates. 
The difference of the measured results between these two kinds of substrates is not 
clear. However, it is believed that the qualitative variation of these properties with the 
Ar/CH4 ratio for these two kinds of substrates would be the same. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The influence of the Ar/CH4 ratio on the characteristics of carbon-coated optical 
fibers prepared by rf-PECVD is investigated. The deposition process of carbon 
coatings by changing the Ar/CH4 ratio is a competition of the penning effect and 
etching effect. When the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 0 to 4, the penning effect is 
more obvious than the etching effect. The penning effect during process enhances the 
complete dissociation of the hydrocarbon gas molecules. As a result, the hydrocarbon 
bonds in the carbon coating decrease, and the sp2 sites present as the olefinic and 
aromatic sp2 C=C bonding structure. Meanwhile, the coating structure shifts to the 
graphite-like carbon and carbon coating becomes more dense structure. On the other 
hand, when the Ar/CH4 ratio increases from 4 to 8, the etching effect is faster than the 
penning effect. Etching effect during process makes the weak bonding, such as 
hydrocarbon bonds, to be broken from the coating structure, so the hydrocarbon bonds 
still decrease. The sp2 sites, which presented as the olefinic and aromatic sp2 C=C 
bonding structure, is still conspicuous, but the disordered bonding angle of sp2 sites is 
gradually formed. The existence of disordered bonding angle of sp2 sites may promote 
the carbon coating easily cross-linking to construct the carbon network. Consequently, 
the results of Raman spectra, Eg, hardness, Young’s modulus, Ra and water CA have a

 Abstract  
The viscoelastic behavior of polymer used as the optical fiber coating is 
experimentally studied by the tensile test and dynamic mechanical analysis. It is 
shown that the viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings can be modeled by the 
four-parameter materials. A four-parameter material consists of two springs and two 
dashpots, in which the spring and dashpot represent the elastic and viscous behavior, 
respectively. The viscoelastic parameters of the four-parameter materials can be 
determined from the tensile test and dynamic mechanical analysis, and the method is 
proposed. The viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings is very important to 
understand the long-term stresses in optical fibers. An application example using the 
four-parameter model to evaluate the effect of polymeric coatings on the fiber’s static 
fatigue is illustrated. It is depicted that the cross-sectional area, Young’s modulus, and 
relaxation time of the secondary coating should be increased to minimize the static 
fatigue of optical fibers.

viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings. It is hard to experimentally verify the 
effect of polymeric coatings on the long-term performance of optical fibers without 
knowing the viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings.  
In this article, the viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings is experimentally 
studied by the tensile test and dynamic mechanical analysis, and the viscoelastic 
model of polymeric coatings is subsequently established. Additionally, the method to 
measure the parameters of viscoelastic model is proposed. Finally, an application 
example using this viscoelastic model to evaluate the effect of polymeric coatings on 
the fiber ’s static fatigue is considered. 
      
2. Viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings 
2.1. Tensile test 
The viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings can be experimentally evaluated 
by the tensile test. In the tensile test, a constant tensile force F is applied on the 
polymeric coating, and then the tensile strain ε(t) as a function of the time t is 
measured. An example of the measured result for a polymeric coating used for optical 
fibers is shown in figure 1, where the applied force F, the cross-sectional area A of the 
polymeric coating, and the test time tf are equal to 2N, 0.126mm2, and 1.5×107s, 
respectively. Refer to the viscoelastic theory, the viscoelastic behavior of the 
polymeric coating can be modeled by the spring and dashpot, in which the spring and 
dashpot represent the elastic and viscous behavior of the polymeric coatings, 
respectively [13, 14]. It is found that the four-parameter model is very suitable to 
characterize the viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric coating illustrated in figure 1. 
A four-parameter model consists of two springs and two dashpots as shown in the 
inset of figure 1. The springs and dashpots of the four-parameter material are arranged 
as follows. First, a spring and a dash are in series to construct the so-called Maxwell

When the time t is much larger than ηk/Ek, the strain rate 
•
ε (t) equals (F/A)/ηm, which 
is independent of the time. This is useful to determine the value of parameter ηm from 
figure 1. Therefore, it is recommended that the tensile test should be carried out until 
the slope of the strain is unchanged with respect to the time. 
 
2.2 Dynamic mechanical analysis 
The other very popular method to experimentally evaluate the viscoelastic 
behavior of polymeric coatings is the dynamic mechanic analysis. In the dynamic 
mechanical analysis, a stress σ(t)[=σ0sin(ωt)] that is varied sinusoidally with the time 
is applied to the viscoelastic material, and the measured strain ε(t)[=ε0sin(ωt-δ)] 
usually lags behind the stress by phase δ. Here ω represents the angular frequency of 
the sinusoidal variation, and σ0 and ε0 denote the stress amplitude and strain 
amplitude, respectively. The commercialized polymeric coating used in the tensile test 
is also adopted in the dynamic mechanical analysis. Figure 2 shows the measured 
result of the dynamic mechanical analysis, where the maximum applied force F0, the 
cross-sectional area A of the polymeric coating, the angular frequency ω, and the 
cycle number n are equal to 2N, 0.126mm2, 1rad/s, and 300, respectively. Figure 2 
depicts that σ0(=F0/A), ε0, and tanδ are equal to 15.9MPa, 0.0133, and 0.0799, 
respectively. Notably, it is found that tanδ is a function of ω, and the measured result 
of tanδ versus ω is shown in figure 3. Figure 3 depicts that tanδ increases with 
 8 
as  
 
ε0=(F0/A){(1/Em)+[1/(ωηm)]+[Ek/(Ek2+ω2ηk2)]} 
 
+(F0/A){[1/(ωηm)]+[ωηk/(Ek2+ω2ηk2)]}ωηkEm/(Ek2+ω2ηk2+EmEk).          (7) 
 
3. Measurement of viscoelastic parameters 
3.1 Tensile test 
As the relation between the strain and time is obtained in the tensile test, the four 
parameters Em, ηm, Ek, and ηk can be determined as follows. First, figure 1 shows that 
ε(t)=εm at t=0. Alternatively, equation (3) reveals that ε(t)=(F/A)/Em at t=0. As a result, 
it is known that Em=(F/A)/εm. Second, figure 1 reveals that the slope of ε(t) is equal to 
εη/tf at t=tf. Meanwhile, equation (4) depicts that the slope of ε(t) is equal to (F/A)/ηm 
at t=tf. Therefore, one obtains that ηm=(F/A)/(εη/tf). Third, figure 1 shows that ε(t) is 
equal to εm+εη+εk at t=tf. On the other hand, equation (3) depicts that ε(t) is equal to 
(F/A)/Em+(F/A)tf/ηm+(F/A)/Ek at t=tf. It is known that εm=(F/A)/Em and εη=(F/A)tf/ηm, 
so Ek=(F/A)/(εk). Finally, whenever Em, ηm, and Ek are solved, ηk can be obtained 
from the curve fitting of figure 1 with the help of equation (3). The measured results 
of the four parameters for the commercialized polymeric coating illustrated in figure 1 
are as follow: Em=1.2GPa, ηm =108GPa．s, Ek=0.5GPa, and ηk =15GPa．s. 
 
3.2 Dynamic mechanical analysis 
In the dynamic mechanical analysis, the four parameters Em, ηm, Ek, and ηk of 
viscoelastic materials can be determined as follows. First, equation (6) shows that 
tanδ is a function of ω, which has a maximum (Em/Ek)/{2[1+(Em/Ek)]1/2} at 
 10 
expressed as the applied tensile stress) and failure time, the lifetime of optical fibers 
under certain lower value of applied tensile stress can be predicted. The tensile stress, 
σa, on the silica glass fiber is strongly affected by the viscoelastic behavior of the 
polymeric coatings in a long term. As a result, it is important to know the viscoelastic 
behavior of polymeric coatings on the static fatigue of optical fibers.  
An example to evaluate the effect of the polymeric coating on the static fatigue 
of double-coated optical fibers is illustrated here. Once the viscoelastic behavior of 
polymeric coatings is known, the tensile stress on the optical fiber can be determined. 
A commercialized double-coated optical fiber is usually constructed of a silica glass 
fiber coated by two polymeric layers, as shown in figure 4. Here r, E, and η represent 
the radius, Young’s modulus, and viscosity coefficient, respectively; and subscripts 0, 
1, and 2 indicate the glass fiber, primary coating, and secondary coating, respectively. 
In the static fatigue test, both ends of the outer surface of the secondary coating are 
clamped, and a tensile force F(t) is applied on the optical fiber along the axial 
direction. The force F(t) is increased from zero to F during a very short time interval, 
and then is fixed at F when the time t≥0. For commercialized double-coated optical 
fibers, Young’s modulus of the primary coating is significantly smaller than Young’s 
moduli of the glass fiber and secondary coating; therefore, we assume that the axial 
tensile force is subjected to the glass fiber and secondary coating, and no axial tensile 
stress is in the primary coating. If the polymeric materials are assumed to be elastic, 
the axial tensile stress on the glass fiber can be derived by use of the elastic theory. 
Furthermore, when the fiber length, 2L, is large enough (e. g., 2L>100mm), the 
maximum axial tensile stress on the glass fiber is occurred at the middle portion of the 
glass fiber and can be expressed as [18]: 
 
σ(t) = [F(t)/(A0)][E0A0/(E0A0+E2A2)],                               (9) 
 12 
 
where  
 
m0=A2EmEkηm ,                                               (14a) 
 
m1=A2Emηm ηk,                                               (14b) 
 
w0=A0E0EmEk ,                                               (14c) 
   
w1= A0E0Emηm +A0E0Emηk + A0E0Ekηm +A2EmEkηm ,                 (14d) 
 
w2=A0E0ηmηk + A2Emηmηk ,                                     (14e) 
 
q=(w12-4w0w2)1/2/(2w2).                                        (14f) 
  
The ratio of viscosity coefficient η to Young’s modulus E is called the relaxation time 
τ [8]. Hence, τm(=ηm/Em) and τk(=ηk/Ek) are relaxation times of Maxwell material and 
Kelvin material, respectively. The relaxation time is better than the viscosity 
coefficient to understand the relaxation behavior of polymeric coatings in a long term 
[9-12]. Therefore, the relaxation time is used to replace the viscosity coefficient in the 
following study. It can be seen that τm=8.33×107s and τk=30s for the polymer shown 
in figures 1-3. 
To know effects of the time and cross-sectional area of the secondary coating on 
the static fatigue, σ(t) versus t at different r2 is shown in figure 5 by solid lines. The 
parameters of this optical fiber are assumed to be r0=62.5µm, r1=100µm, E0=72.5GPa, 
Em=1.2GPa, Ek=0.5GPa, τm=8.33×107s, τk=30s, and F=2N with the exception of the 
 14 
fiber derived from Maxwell material is also shown in figure 5 by dashed lines. 
Notably, the equation of the tensile stress on the glass fiber derived from Maxwell 
material can be found in reference [11]. Figure 5 indicates that the tensile stress on the 
glass fiber for these two models exhibits the similar behavior. It means that the 
applied tensile force is initially subjected to the glass fiber and secondary coating, and 
then the applied tensile force is gradually transferred from the polymeric coating to 
the glass fiber. Nevertheless, figure 5 also indicates that σ(t) in Maxwell materials is 
smaller than that in four-parameter materials. Hence, if the tensile stress on the glass 
fiber is calculated by Maxwell model, the lifetime of the optical fiber will be over 
estimated in the real application. As a result, it is suggested that the four-parameter 
model of polymeric coatings should be used to evaluate the effect of polymeric 
coatings on the long-term performance of optical fibers, such as static fatigue and 
microbending losses. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings for optical fibers is 
experimentally studied by the tensile test and dynamic mechanical analysis. It is 
indicated that the viscoelastic behavior of polymeric coatings can be modeled by the 
four-parameter material. The viscoelastic parameters of the four-parameter materials 
can be determined from the tensile test and dynamic mechanical analysis. An 
application example using the four-parameter model to evaluate the effect of 
polymeric coating on the fiber ’s static fatigue is illustrated. It is shown that a 
secondary coating with larger axial rigidity and relaxation time would produce lower 
tensile stress on the glass fiber in a long term. Furthermore, if the tensile stress on the 
glass fiber is calculated by Maxwell model, the lifetime of the optical fiber will be 
over estimated in the real application.
