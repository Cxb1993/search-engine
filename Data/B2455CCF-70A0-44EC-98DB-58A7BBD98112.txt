highly focused laser beam, the spectral properties of the PC nanocavity emitters were 
characterized with an off-focus excitation condition, corresponding to a beam spot size of 40 μm.  
The emission spectra were analyzed at different pump pulse energies up to a maximum of 
0.95 μJ. As shown in Fig. 2, multiple emission peaks were observed at the wave-lengths 
λ=371.3,371.8, and 374 nm. The emission from deep donor levels to the valence band can be 
seen at λ=380 nm. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the emission spectrum at the pump pulse energy of 
0.25 μJ. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) was obtained by Lorentzian curve fitting and 
found to be Δλ=3.5 and 2 Å for λ=371.3 and 371.8 nm, respectively. Since there are shoulder 
features around the lasing peaks which cannot be fitted well with Lorentzians, the FWHMs could 
be limited by the resolution of the CCD spectrometer. The inset also shows a near-field image 
taken by a CCD camera with a spectral resolution of 60 nm/pixel. Although, the intensity 
distribution cannot be resolved in the nanocavity, laser emission was only observed when the 
excitation beam was focused on to the defect region. Only spontaneous emission (SpE) was 
observed from the PC or bulk region. 
As the emission intensity was plotted versus the excitation at one of the lasing wavelengths, 
λ=371.3 nm, a soft turn-on behavior was observed, as shown in Fig. 3. The threshold pump pulse 
energy is found to be 0.15 μJ, corresponding to the excitation energy density of ~12 mJ/cm2 The 
carrier density at the threshold is estimated to be ~1.8X1022cm−3, assuming a quantum efficiency 
of 10%. After lasing, the output intensity monotonically increases with the increase of the 
excitation energy. Moreover, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the SpE factor (β) of the GaN PC 
nanocavity is calculated to be ~0.045 at λ=371.3 nm, obtained by normalizing the threshold 
intensity to be equivalent to one photon output at the threshold. The estimated  is comparable to 
that of the surface-emitting vertical cavity lasers. Since is depicted by the coupling efficiency of 
the total SpE to one of the lasing peaks, we believe that this enhancement is mainly attributed to 
the reduced modal volume in the nanocavity. Analysis of the other lasing mode at λ=371.8 nm 
gives rise to the same order of magnitudes in an estimated threshold and β.  
In order to clarify the lasing mechanism, we compared the emission spectra from PC 
nanocavities of different sizes, denoted as H1, H2, and H3 cavities, at three different pumping 
levels, corresponding to (a) 0.25, (b)0.4, and (c)0.6 μJ, as shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum of H1 
defect shows only stimulated emission at λ=371.5 nm with a FWHM Δλ∼2 nm, while the spectra 
of H2 and H3 cavities exhibit multiple emission peaks with FWHMs in the order of angstroms. 
Since the three cavities share the same vertical structure, lasing is believed to be originated 
horizontally due to total internal reflection. The multiple cavity modes could be the superposition 
of longitudinal modes resulting from different resonance paths in the nanocavities. Moreover, as 
seen in Fig. 4, the emission peaks from three different nanocavities only occur within a narrow 
wavelength range of 3 nm, between 371 and 374 nm. Since this range barely overlaps with the PL 
of bulk GaN, it is important to further investigate the output coupling mechanisms and the origins 
of the narrow emission wavelength range.  
Enhanced coupling of the guided modes to vertical radiation via photonic crystal Bloch 
modes has been reported. The PC assists in vertical light emission by phase matching the 
horizontally guided modes to the radiation modes above the light line. The most efficient 
coupling occurs at the eigenfrequencies with zero in-plane wave vector, denoted as Γ point in the

occurred at a threshold of pulse energy of ~0.15 μJ. The spontaneous emission factor  β was calculated to 
be ~0.045, as shown in the inset.

cavities at three different pumping levels:(a)0.25,  (b) 0.4, and  (c) 0.6 μJ. The H1 defect shows only 
stimulated emission at λ=371.5 nm with a FWHM ~ nm, while the spectra of H2 and H3 defects show 
multiple lasing peaks with FWHMs in the order of angstroms. All emission peaks occur between 371 and 
374 nm. 
 
2. GaN-based two-dimensional surface-emitting photonic crystal laser 
We have been successfully fabrication GaN photonic crystal photonic crystal laser Fig.5(a) 
shows the two-dimensional(2D) surface-emitting photonic crystal laser grown by a metal-organic 
chemical vapor deposition system on c-face 2 in diameter sapphire. Trimethylindium, 
trimethylgallium, trimethylalu minum, and ammonia were used as the In, Ga, Al, and Nsources, 
respectively. The 35 pairs quarter-wave GaN/AlN DBR grown on a 2 μm thick undoped GaN 
buffer layer was crack free and had a flat surface.  
We defined on the soft mask a hexagonal PC pattern with the lattice constant a ranging from 
190 to 300 nm and the circular hole diameter r chosen such that r /a is about 0.28. The whole PC 
pattern is of a circular shape with a diameter of 50 μm. Then, the PC pattern on soft mask was 
transferred to SiN film by inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE). After the 
PMMA layer was removed by acetone, we used ICP-RIE to etch down the as-grown sample to 
about 400 nm deep. The etching penetrated the QW active regions and created the PC patterns in 
the nitride layers. Finally, the SiN hard mask was removed by buffered oxide etch dipping. The 
top view of the hexagonal PC pattern on the GaN-based structure thus created was shown in 
Fig.5(b).

Ⅱ. Fabrication and measurement of InGaN-base nanopillar 
We fabricate a freestanding nanopillar with a diameter of 300 nm and a height of 2μm is 
using a focused ion beam (FIB). The measured microphoto-luminescence (μ−PL) from the 
embedded InGaN/GaN MQWs shows an energy shift of 68 meV and a slightly broadened full 
width at half maximum (FWHM), which are caused by the strain relaxation of MQWs in the 
nanopillar. Calculations based on the valence force field (VFF) method reveal the correlation 
between the emission characteristics and the spatially varied polarization field. Moreover, the 
power-dependent μPL measurement suggests that the strain-relaxed emission region of the 
nanopillar exhibits a higher radiative recombination rate than that of the strained region, making 
strain-relaxed InGaN-based nanopillars a promising candidate for high-efficiency UV/blue light 
sources. 
As seen in Fig. 5(a), the epitaxial structure of the device consists of a 2μm thick GaN 
nucleation layer, a 2μm thick Si doped n-GaN cladding layer, ten periods of 2.5 nm thick 
In0.2Ga0.8N MQWs separated by a 10 nm thick GaN barrier, a 100 nm thick AlGaN cladding layer, 
and a 100 nm thick Mg-doped p-GaN layer. To prepare for the FIB milling, a 100 nm thick SiNx 
was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, followed by a 200 nm thick Al 
layer using electron-beam evaporation. Then, a platinum (Pt) mask with a thickness of 500 nm

effect. However, the strain variation of the MQWs embedded in a nanostructure can become 
significant, altering the distribution of the polarization field and hence the emission spectrum. It is 
therefore of great interest to investigate the strain variation in the nanopillar. Calculations based 
on the VFF model have been developed for wurtzite nanostructures. VFF is a microscopic model 
which determines the positions of each individual atom in a nanopillar by minimizing the elastic 
energy of the entire structure. Once the atoms’ positions are known, calculating the strain tensor 
distribution is straightforward. To maintain the symmetry in a wurtzite structure, freestanding, 
rhombus-shaped GaN pillars consisting of ten-pair In0.2Ga0.8N MQWs are defined with various 
edge widths ranging from 60 to 180 nm. The pillars have a fixed boundary condition at the 
bottom and free boundary conditions on other sides. The calculated distributions of the strain 
tensors εxx and εzz are plotted in Fig.11 for a nanopillar with a height of Z=300 nm and an edge 
width of X =180 nm. Both strain tensors show considerable relaxations on the outer shell of the 
nanopillar and as-grown-like strain distributions in the center of the nanopillar. The other in- 
plane strain tensor, εyy has a similar distribution to that of εxx. As shown in Fig.11(a), the strain 
relaxation of εxx occurs at a distance of 40 nm from the edge of the nanopillar. At X=1.91 nm, 
where the change of strain from the pillar center is most significant, there exist substantial strain 
variations on the QW/barrier interfaces and a slight tensile strain of εxx in the barriers. Moreover, 
as shown in Fig. 11(b), the strain relaxation of εzz takes place within a distance of ~10 nm, much 
shorter than that of εxx. We also observe a vertical distribution of εzz in the Z direction, mainly 
arising from thestacking of MQWs. Both in-plane and vertical strain tensors contribute to the 
polarization field Pez via the expression 
Pez = e31εxx + e31εyy + e33εzz  (1) 
where e31 and e33 are piezoelectric coefficients. Based on the calculated strain shown in Fig. 11, 
we obtain the piezoelectric filed of ~0.0276 C/m2 in the center of the nanopillar and of ~0.01 
C/m2 at X=1.91 nm. The energy shift due to the difference in the present piezoelectric field can be 
estimated using a simplified structure containing an In0.2Ga0.8N/GaN single QW with a 
thickness of 2.5 nm located between a 2μm thick n-GaN and 100 nm thick p-GaN with doping 
concentrations of 1018cm−3. The carrier density n2D is estimated to be ~7.0X1012 cm−2 under an 
excitation power of 10 mW. An energy shift of ~210 meV is calculated, corresponding to λ=415 
nm, which matches the blue edge of the PL from the strain- relaxed region, as shown in Fig. 10(b). 
Since the center of MQWs still suffers from strain with its magnitude comparable to that of the 
as-grown planar structure, the photoluminescence from the center of the pillar contributes to the 
red edge emission, which is also partially overlapped with the PL from the strained region, as 
expected. Hence, we believe that the majority of the nanopillar photoluminescence originates 
from the strain-relaxed region, within a distance of~40 nm near the edge of the nanopillar. 
Moreover, the variation of strain tensors in the relaxation region results in a spatially varied 
polarization field, leading to the broadened emission spectrum. 
Figure 12(a) shows the measured power-dependent μ-PL spectra of the device without the Pt 
mask with excitation powers varying from 0.88 to 15.83 mW. The peak intensities, emission 
wavelengths, and FWHMs of the PL from the strained and the strain-relaxed regions are derived 
from the Lorentzian fitting of the measured spectra, as plotted in Figs.12(b)–12(d), respectively. 
As seen in Fig. 12(b), the PL intensity of the strained region first increases with excitation power,

nanopillar, X=95.67 nm, and at the edge, X=1.91 nm, are also plotted.

Ⅲ. Successfully fabrication of high efficiency light emitting diodes by using nano strictures. 
We have been successfully fabrication high efficiency LEDs by using three different kinds 
of nano structures. It is not only for light extraction but also for far field profile contra 
 
1. Indium-tin-oxide nanorods for enhanced light extraction 
The characteristic formation of ITO nanorods is assisted by an obliquely incident nitrogen 
flux using electron-beam evaporation. Figure13 (a) shows the formation of nucleation cores at the 
beginning of evaporation. The density could  vary from 5x109cm−2 to 2x1010 cm−2, depending on 
the deposition rate and temperature. The deposited nanorods are randomly oriented with heights 
of 100nm to 300nm and widths of ~40nm, as shown in Fig.13(b). A high resolution transmission 
electron microscopic (TEM)  image shown in Fig.13(c) reveals the core-shell structure of an 
ITO nanorod, where the stripe-like Moiré fringes suggest crystalline material qualities in the 
center. The energy dispersive X-ray analyses (EDX) also shows that the outer shell possesses a 
higher tin content than the core region does, indicating the possible occurrence of tin-doped 
indium segregation during the deposition.

evenly enhanced in the spatial domain without deteriorating the current spreading, assuring the 
practical application of the nanorod deposition technique. 
We further investigate the dependence of light extraction efficiency on the thickness of the 
ITO nanorod layer using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) method. 
The calculation results are plotted in Fig. 18, where the enhancement factor is defined as the ratio 
of the change in the extracted power from the nanorod layer divided by the power detected from 
the ITO layer without nanorods. As shown in Fig. 18, the enhancement factor monotonically 
increases with the thickness of the nanorod layer and saturates at a maximum value of ~32.5%, 
when the height is over 450 nm. The calculations suggest that the randomly oriented nanorods 
behave as a layer with a gradient index profile, instead of a layer with an effective refractive 
index. The latter often results in an oscillatory dependence of the extracted power on the layer 
thickness due to the Fabry-Perrot effect. The device behavior, as the nanorod layer thickness 
increases, implies a gradually changing gradient of the refractive index profile,  which is critical 
to the enhancement of extraction efficiency. As the thickness reaches a certain value, 450nm in 
this case, the gradient-index profile is no longer the dominant factor to further increase extracted 
power.Therefore, the enhancement factor saturates. However, we have to note that the calculated 
enhancement factor is smaller than the measured value of 35.1% for a packaged device at the 
350nm thickness, since the measured enhancement factor is generally larger for a non- packaged 
device(>40%). The discrepancy may be attributed to the defined nanorod profile not being fully 
representative to the grown structure. We are currently conducting experiments to verify the 
dependence of the enhancement factor on the nanorod layer thickness.

and an ICP/bias power of 200/200W. The remaining PS nanospheres were removed by dipping 
into acetone with sonification for 5 min, as illustrated in Fig. 19(d). Finally, an n-GaN electrode 
consisting of Ti–Pt–Au (100 nm/100 nm/2000 nm was deposited. The diameter of the n-pad was 
100 m. Fig. 20(a) and (b) shows the scanning electron microscopic(SEM) images of the 
fabricated biomimetic structures at different magnifications. The moth-eye-like structures 
revealed atriangular lattice with a period of 350 nm. The periodic is land shave a mean diameter 
of 250 nm with uniformity better than10% and an averaged height of 300 nm with uniformity 
better than 5%. In this process, the 2-D lattice showed single-crystal domains on the order of 10- 
to 50- μm range. However, the lattice has different crystal domains in the large dimension above 
10- to 50-μm range. As seen in Fig. 20(b), the biomimetic structures show flat-top surfaces which 
were covered by the remaining PS nanospheres after the ICP-RIE process. Therefore, the 
biomimetic structures with larger aspect ratios are achievable with further optimized etching 
conditions. The current–voltage (I–V) and the intensity–current (L–I) characteristics of VI-LED 
with and without the self-assembled biomimetic surface structures are shown in Fig. 3. The I–V 
curves of both devices are nearly identical, indicating that the fabrication process did not 
deteriorate the electrical properties of the VI-LED. The corresponding – characteristics of both 
devices show great linearity up to 500 mA due to efficient thermal dissipation in the design of 
VI-LEDs. The respective output powers for VI-LEDs with a flat surface and with self-as-sembled 
biomimetic surface structures were 143 and 241 mW at a driving current of 350 mA, showing an 
enhancement factor of 68%. The light output power increment arises from both the roughened 
surface and also the gradient changed refractive index due to the biomimetic structural profile a 
2-D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with the perfectly matched layer (PML) 
boundary condition was employed to examine the relationship between the etching depth and the 
enhancement factor. The simulated index profile is shown on the inset of Fig. 22, where an array 
of parabolic structures is defined on top of the GaN surface. The structural dimensions are 
extracted from the SEM images shown in Fig. 20 with 15 dipole illumination sources placed at 
1.5μm below the tip of surface structures and three detectors around the simulated device . As 
shown in Fig. 22, the enhancement factor monotonically increases with the etching depth. The 
optimized depth lies between 600 nm and 1μm due to both the waveguiding effect and the 
shortened distance between the roughened surface and the active region. Further etching depths 
are not preferred due to the distance required for current spreading. In this process, the etching 
depth of 300 nm is limited by the selectivity ratio between the nanospheres and GaN. Finally, we 
note that a factor of 115% is predicted for the 300-nm depth. The discrepancy between the 
experiment and simulation is possibly due to shape imperfections during the fabrication of 
biomimetic structures. The far-field radiation patterns of the VI-LEDs with a flat surface and with 
biomimetic surface structures were measured, as shown in Fig. 23. A regular Lambertian-like 
emission pattern is observed from the VI-LED with a flat surface. Nevertheless, the VI-LED with 
biomimetic surface structures results in a heart-shaped radiation profile, since the dimension of 
biomimetic structures is close to the blue light wavelength. The diffraction of the particular 2-D 
structures redistributes the output light along lateral directions.We have also found that the 
radiation profile is highly related to both the arrangement and the shape of the nanostructures

photon-band structure agreement with the fundamental mode effective refractive index dispersion 
curve. In addition, GaN PhC uMCLED increase the output power extraction efficiency by 
145.9% (~2.46X) compared with GaN non-PhC uMCLED, and a directional far-field emission 
pattern at half intensity of nearly  
The schematic of GaN PhC uMCLED presented in this letter is shown in Fig.24. Than we 
performed angular-spectra-resolved EL measurements to study the guided mode extraction 
behavior and the distribution of far-field emission. The angular spectra at various angles from the 
planar (non-PhC) GaN uMCLED are displayed in Fig. 25 with a plot of “wave-length versus 
angle.” The angular spectra were normalized by the shape of the MQW line. The 550 nm GaN 
uMCLED had six resonance modes. Figure 25 reveals only one Fabry–Perot (FP) mode within 
the extraction cone, and other resonance modes trapped in the GaN waveguide as guided mode. 
In addition, the FP effect modulates the MQW emission of GaN uMCLED and showed near 
perfect resonance between the emission wavelength and the cavity length indicated by normal 
emission. To increase the light extraction efficiency (LEE) and obtain a directional far-field 
emission pattern from a non-optimized cavity length of 550 nm GaN uMCLED, we used the GaN 
uMCLED incorporated with a PhC lattice to enhance the LEE. Angular-spectra-resolved EL 
measurement indicated GaN PhC uMCLED with a square PhC lattice constant of a=370 nm, and 
two different PhC hole depths, where the shallow and deep etching of the PhC hole depth were 
about 100 and 250 nm. This is clearly shown in Figs.26(a) and 26(b) with light collected along 
the ΓX (left) and ΓM (right). The shape of MQW line normalized these angular spectra of GaN 
PhC uMCLED. The light traveling through the waveguide in the GaN PhC uMCLEDs was 
diffracted by reciprocal wave vectors associated with the PhC. The sharp lines could be attributed 
to extracted wave guided modes propagating in the GaN waveguides formed with the GaN 
ultrathin cavity between the Ag reflector mirror and the air. Observations of the GaN 
shallow-PhC uMCLEDs revealed only two lower-order guided mode extractions, as shown in Fig. 
26(a). In contrast, Fig. 26(b) illustrated the GaN deep-PhC uMCLEDs in nearly single guided 
mode extraction. To study these modes more clearly, this study transformed the spectra shown in 
Fig. 26(b) to the guided mode dispersion curves shown in Fig. 26(c). The image shows the 
normalized dispersion curves for each mode line in the ΓX (left) and ΓM (right) directions, which 
were sections of the band of PhC. They can be quantitatively analyzed using the Ewald 
construction of the Bragg diffraction theory in reciprocal space. When the in-plane component of 
the resultant wave vector after coupling to a reciprocal lattice vector fell within the circle of air, 
the diffracted light escaped into the air. To study the observed lines of guided mode, the 
dispersion of the effective refractive index nm,eff(λ) of fundamental mode (m=0) was calculated 
by a slab waveguide with the GaN material dispersion formula as a Sellimer equation. The 
effective refractive index dispersion curves of the fundamental mode were calculated by a Bragg 
diffraction equation as |k0,eff xG| k0, where k0,eff=2n0,eff(λ)π/λ is a wave vector of the 
fundamental mode effective refractive index dispersion; k0=2π/λ0 is a wave vector of the air 
circle; x=1,2,... is an integer of diffractionorder; 2GΓX (square, □), GX1M (circle, ○), GΓM 
(triangular,△), and 2GΓM (rhombus, ◇) of four reciprocal diffraction vector interactions with 
ΓX and ΓM direction of the square PhC lattice, as shown in Fig. 26(c). These dispersion curves 
were used to match the observing guided mode lines in Fig.26(c). The fundamental guided mode

Ⅳ. Manipulative Polarization of a-plane InGaN/GaN Photonic Crystals for Enhanced 
Spontaneous Emission 
We designed modified quasi-L2 GaN PC microcavity slab where the refractive index (n) is ~2.5 
and the thicknes (d/a) ~0.7 as shown in Fig. 28(a). Because such a cavity has high Q, small Vm 
 22
Fermi golden rule, as equation (2) where ρc is a normalized Lorentzian with a finite line-width to 
take into account the optical loss (Q-factor) for cavity mode, and ωk is resonant mode frequency. 
fe and fh are Fermi-Dirac function, and En,m is the effective band-gap from state n and m. σ is the 
inhomogeneous broadening function. The PC microcavity mode characteristics and the 
parameters are taken into count in the Fermi’s golden rule. The enhancement factor is ratio of the 
SpE rate in the cavity to that in free space. The calculated SpE enhancement factor as a function 
of r’ is plotted in Fig. 27 for (a) different well thicknesses and (b) different indium compositions. 
As seen in Fig. 27(a), the thinner well has better polarization alignment with the electric charges. 
Therefore the SpE enhancement factor can be as high as > 800. 
 
In Fig. 27(b), the y-polarization 
increases as indium increases, thus the enhancement factor is increased accordingly, up to 900 
times. The ideal Purcell factor Fp=3Q(λ^3)/(Vm4π^2) gives Fp~1500, which assumes perfect 
polarization alignment. Our method proposes the realistic cavity engineering for enhanced SpE 
that is customized for the a-plane InGaN/GaN quantum well.

04/14 Tuesday 
 
   Today, my activities are concentrated on attending the invited talks. 2010 MRS spring offers a 
very strong program, where renowned researchers and scientists from all over the world are 
coming to share their latest work, which is often published in Nature or Science journals, and some 
of their unpublished results. I attended a couple that I think helped and impressed me the most.  
 
Metal-Assisted Fabrication and Applications of Si Nanowires Array  By Shui-Tong Lee From 
Center of Superdiamond and Advanced Films, City University Of Hong Kong 
  
    Prof. Lee introduced their years of work on understanding the silicon nanowires and 
nanostructures fabricated by metal induced electroless etching. There he summarized the surface 
properties of nanostructures dictate the electrical and optical properties of the nanostructured 
devices. His group has made photoelectrochemical solar cells with various semiconductor 
nanowire electrodes, which I do not plan to work on, but certainly learned a lot about the surface 
properties.  I have also talked to Prof. Lee and plan to spend this summer as a visiting scholar in 
his group. 
 
Talk summary: 
 Self electrophoresis mechanism AFM 18 3026 2008 
 Controlled fabrication of SINWs APL 90 16xx 2007 
 n-type H-SiNWs show p-type behavior: enhancement of p-type in acid ambient -> p-type 
conduction increase considerably in acid ambient 
Surface modification of nanowires in acid=>p-type 
Surface modification of nanowires in base=>n-type 
 surface charge transfer model: Charrapani science 2007 
 Surface properties dictate nanostructures, device properties 
 
Application of Si-Nanowire arrays 
-SiNW coated with different metals degradation of Rhodamine B 
-Hydrogen on surface attracts electron and promote e-h separation and catalysis activity 
-Metal-assisted etching 
-Energy application 
pt coated sinw for efficient carrier collection in PEC pv cell, [K. Q. Peng NL 2009] 
-Battery application SiNW lithium battery[ APL 2008 033105] :Surface becomes rougher; 
-Microtube of si-nanoholes much better than nanowires 
-Ag catalyzed SiNW array Gas sensors 
 
 
The poster session runs from 5pm to 8pm. I have exchanged ideas with a couple of scholars and 
scientist .

二、建議 
This year, MRS spring has more than 4000 papers presented and more than 5000 attendees. It 
is my second time attending this biggest meeting in material research. I was overwhelmed with the 
strong program, and the quality of talks, which are driving my group and I to do a quality work. 
The conference also offers many seminars in professional development, which I rarely seen in 
other conferences. The information and knowledge is very helpful to researchers like my self and 
most importantly, to students. We should encourage students to attend good conference like this 
and get involved with the student chapters and volunteers.
