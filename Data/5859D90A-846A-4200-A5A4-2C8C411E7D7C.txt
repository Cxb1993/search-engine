 2 
neural network (RNN), and PSOLA 
algorithms are employed to build the AM. 
The consistency is especially emphasized 
and analyzed in this dissertation. The 
consistency means that the high-correlated 
warping curve between spectrum and prosody 
is definitely existed for the designate 
pronunciation in the same word. The 
experimental results confirm this phenomenon. 
This conclusion gives a direction about that 
the warping process of spectrum and prosody 
intra the syllable must be considered in detail 
for TTS system. 
Based on the analytic results, five 
strategies are presented to implement the AM 
in Mandarin TTS. Firstly, the HMM algorithm 
is employed to automatically perform the 
phonetic segmentation on speech corpus as 
well as organize the representative prosody 
and spectrum modules. Secondly, the prosody 
and spectrum modules are trained together to 
keep the consistence within AM. Thirdly, the 
generation algorithm of synthesis unit is used 
to produce the prosody unit embedded and 
make the warping process in synthesis unit 
available. Fourth, the waveform-based 
synthesis unit and warping process make the 
synthesized speech clear, natural, and fluent. 
Fifth, the coarticulation module is primary 
studied to remove the coarticulation effect. 
 Finally, the performance analyses 
including the speech quality, memory 
requirement, and computational complexity 
are examined in our system. Smaller than 
2.4MB memory space and average 0.08 MIPS 
for each syllable can be achieved on the 
fixed-point DSP chip. Also, the synthesized 
speech sounds very good. These results 
confirm the high performance in our system. 
Many speech applications with high quality 
and low cost can be easily achieved in our 
TTS solution.

三、結果與討論 
本計劃使用下表所列之語音資料做實驗
分析, 資料量非常大, 而且音節位址都已經

我們將 HMM(Level Building)自動切割後產
生之State Duration做統計與分析, 每個音節
切三段(Segment), 第一段為 Initial, 含有三
個 State, 第二與三段為 Final,分別包含有兩
個及三個 State, 而在大量資料中, “ㄓ” 這個
音總共出現 501 個音節, 因此我們將 “ㄓ” 
之音節 Segment Duration作分析, 我們先將
501 個音之每段 State Duration 做 VQ 分類, 
Codeword之數量為4, 表 2.為501個音經過
VQ訓練後之 Codebook內容
