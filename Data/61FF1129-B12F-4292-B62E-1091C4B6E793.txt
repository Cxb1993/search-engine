economic criterion. We ﬁrst review the design principle of
VP T2 chart and illustrate the adaptive procedure by an
example. Then, we develop an economic design of the VP T2
control chart based on Markov chain approach. The use of
Markov chain allows us easily to obtain the statistical
properties of the chart that are essential to our cost function.
Following this, the optimal design parameters can be found
through the genetic algorithms (GAs) such that the cost
function is minimized. Finally, we make numerical illustra-
tions and comparisons, and provide some concluding
remarks.
2. The VP T2 control chart
Chen (2005) applied the VP control procedure to multi-
variate process monitoring. This procedure is called a VP T2
control chart. This section explains its design principle.
2.1. Design principle of VP T2 control chart
Assume that the (p 1) random vectors X1, X2, X3y, each
representing the p quality characteristics of interest, are
observed over time, where these vectors represent individual
observations or sample mean vectors. A natural multivariate
extension to the univariate Shewhart chart is the Hotelling’s
multivariate control chart (Hotelling, 1947). This procedure
assumes the p quality characteristics are jointly distributed as
p-variate normal with mean vector l and covariance matrix
R. When Xis represent the independent sample mean vectors
with sample size of n, the Hotelling’s multivariate control
chart signals that a process mean shift has occurred as
soon as
w2i ¼ nðXi  l0Þ0S10 ðXi  l0Þ4k ð1Þ
where l0 and R0 denote the in-control process mean vector
and covariance matrix, respectively, and k is a speciﬁed
action limit given by the upper a percentage point of w2-
distribution with p degrees of freedom, denoting wp,a
2 . When
Xis represent the individual observations, the sample size in
(1) is equal to one.
If l0 and R0 are unknown, then they are estimated by the
averaged sample mean vector X and sample covariance
matrix S from m initial (p 1) random vectors prior to
on-line process monitoring, and a T2 statistic deﬁned by
T2i ¼ nðXi  XÞ0S1ðXi  XÞ ð2Þ
is the approximate statistic for the Hotelling’s multivariate
control chart. The action limit k for Hotelling’s T2 control
chart to monitor future random vectors is given by Alt
(1984) as
k ¼ Cðm; n; pÞFp;n;a ð3Þ
where C(m, n, p)¼ p(mþ 1)(n1)/(mnmpþ 1), v¼mn
mpþ 1, and Fp,n,a is the upper a percentage point of F-
distribution with p and v degrees of freedom if sample size
n41 Moreover, C(m, n, p)¼ p(mþ 1)(m1)/m2mp and
v¼mp if sample size n¼ 1.
Traditionally, Hotelling’s T2 chart operates with ﬁxed
sampling rate (FSR), that is, a sample of size n0 is drawn
every h0 hours, and the value of the T
2 statistic (ie sample
point) is plotted on a control chart with k0 ¼
Cðm; n0; pÞFp;n;a0 as the action limit. The VP T2 chart is a
modiﬁcation of the FSR T2 chart. Let (n1, h1) be a pair of
minimum sample size and longest sampling interval, and
(n2, h2) be a pair of maximum sample size and shortest
sampling interval. These pairs are chosen such that
n1on0on2 and h2oh0oh1. The decision to switch between
the maximum and minimum parameters depends on the
prior sample point on the control chart. That is, the position
of the prior sample point on the chart determines the size of
the current sample and the time of its sampling (See
Figure 1). If the prior sample point (i1) falls in the
tightening region, the pair (n2, h2) should be used for the
current sample point (i). On the other hand, if the prior
sample point (i1) falls in the relaxing region, the pair
(n1, h1) should be used for the current sample point (i). Here,
the tightening and relaxing region are given by the warning
limit wj and the action limit kj ¼ Cðm; nj; pÞFp;nj ;aj (tighten-
ing region is given by (wj, kj) and relaxing region is given by
[0,wj], respectively, where j¼ 1 if the prior sample point
comes from the small sample, and j¼ 2 if the prior sample
point comes from the large sample. Here, we assumed
k14k04k2.

The economic design of VP T2 control charts is carried out
by specifying a cost function, and searching the optimal
design parameters for minimizing the cost function over a
production cycle. The production cycle length is deﬁned as
the average time from the start (or restart) of production
until the assignable cause is identiﬁed and eliminated. Once
the expected cycle length is determined, the cost over the
production cycle can be converted to an index—long run
expected cost per hour (Ross, 1970). The optimal values of
the design parameters based on the cost function can be
determined by some optimization technique such as the grid
search, nonlinear programming, or GAs.
Figure 3 depicts the production cycle, which is divided
into four time intervals of in-control period, out-of-control
period, searching period due to false alarm, and the time
period for identifying and correcting the assignable cause.
Individuals are now illustrated before they are grouped
together.
T1: The expected length of in-control period is 1/l.
T2: The expected length of out-of-control represents the
average time needed for the control chart to produce a
signal after the process mean shift. This average time is
called the adjusted average time to signal (AATS),
which is the most widely used statistical measure for
comparing the efﬁciencies of different adaptive control
chart. The memoryless property of the exponential
distribution allows the computation of AATS using
the Markov Chain approach. The fundamental con-
cepts used in the following paragraphs can be found in
Cinlar (1975).
LetM be the average time from the cycle start to the time
the chart signals after the process shift. Then,
AATS ¼M  1=l ð5Þ
At each sampling time during the period M, one of the ﬁve
transient states is reached according to the status of the
process (in or out-of-control) and the position of Ti
2
(relaxing, tightening, or action region) (see Table 2):
State 1: the process is in-control and Ti
2 falls into the
relaxing region;
State 2: the process is in-control and Ti
2 falls into the
tightening region;
State 3: the process is in-control and Ti
2 falls into the action
region;
State 4: the process is out-of-control and Ti
2 falls into the
relaxing region;
State 5: the process is out-of-control and Ti
2 falls into the
tightening region.
When State 3 is reached, the signal the chart produces is a
false alarm. If Ti
2 falls into the action region at some
sampling time while the process status is out-of-control, then
the signal is a true alarm and the absorbing state, State 6, is
reached.

and the design parameters (n1, n2, h1, h2,w1,w2,k1,k2). The
economic design of a control chart for a particular
application is to derive the design parameters that minimizes
E(L), assuming the process and cost parameters are given. In
doing so, we apply the GAs as the minimization problem has
a nonlinear objective function with the following constraints:
n1 and n2AZ
þ (positive integers); h1Xh2X0; 0pw1pk1;
0pw2pk2; and k14k2 that result in mixed continuous-
discrete decision variables and a discontinuous and non-
convex solution space. If typical non-linear programming
techniques are used to solve this optimization problem, they
will be inefﬁcient and time-consuming.
GAs are global search and optimization techniques
motivated by the process of natural selection in biological
system (Goldberg, 1989; Davis, 1991). They have been used
successfully in the optimization ﬁeld of the parameters of
quality control charts (eg He et al, 2002; He and Grigoryan,
2002; Aparisi and Garcı´a-Dı´az, 2003; Chen, 2004). GAs are
different from other search procedures in the following ways
(Karr and Gentry, 1993): (1) GAs consider many points in
the search space simultaneously, rather than a single point;
(2) GAs work directly with strings of characters representing
the parameter set, not the parameters themselves; and (3)
GAs use probabilistic rules to guide their search, not
deterministic rules. Because GAs consider many points in
the search space simultaneously there is a less chance of
converging to local optima. Furthermore, in a conventional
search, based on a decision rule, a single point is considered,
and that is unreliable in multimodal space.
The primary distinguishing features of GAs are an
encoding, a ﬁtness function, a selection mechanism, a
crossover mechanism, a mutation mechanism, and a culling
mechanism. The algorithm for GAs can be formulated as the
following steps:
Step 1: Randomly generate an initial solution set (popula-
tion) of N individuals and evaluate each solution
(individual) by ﬁtness function. Usually an indivi-
dual is represented as a numerical string.
Step 2: If the termination condition is not met,
repeatedly do {Select parents from population
for crossover.
Generate offspring.
Mutate some of the numbers.
Merge mutants and offspring into population.
Cull some members of the population.}
Step 3: Stop and return the best ﬁtted solution.
When applying GAs to the minimization problem, a
decimal encoding of individuals is adopted so that each
individual in the form of decimal string represents a possible
solution for (n1, n2, h1, h2,w1,w2, k1, k2). The ﬁtness value of
each individual is evaluated by the expected loss per hour,
E(L). Based on the ‘elitist’ strategy of above algorithm, that
is, the survival of the ﬁttest, the evolution of a population of
N individuals has been pursued. The termination condition
is achieved when the number of generations is large enough
or a satisﬁed ﬁtness value is obtained.
5. Numerical illustrations and comparisons
Table 3 gives 13 examples, whose process parameters
(t0, t1, l, d) and the cost parameters (s,C0,C1,V0,V1) are
modiﬁed from Costa (2001), to illustrate the economic
design of the VP T2 chart.
In selecting the m value, Quesenberry (1993) suggested it
should be large enough so that the charts based on estimated
parameters (X and S) perform in a similar manner to the
charts based on true parameters (l0 and R0) during the on-
line process monitoring stage. Lowry and Montgomery
(1995) recommended the minimum m values necessary for
several combinations of p and n. Nedumaran and Pignatiello
(1999) followed these studies and considered the run length
distribution performance of the respective control charts to
speculate a range from 800p/3(n1) to 400p/(n1), which is
necessary for minimum m. Referring to the above range, the

(3) Similar to the FSR T2control chart, a longer waiting
time with a larger sample size and a wider action limit
are necessary to economically operate the VP T2control
chart as p increase from two to four. However, the VP
control procedure requires more often sampling with
a smaller sample size and a wider action limit in
comparison with the FSR control procedure, without
respect to p¼ 2 or 4.
(4) Using T2 control chart with VP control procedure offer
better protection against false alarm, E(FA).
Table 6 continues the ﬁrst example and shows the optimal
design parameters for various m values. From the results we
ﬁnd that all of the optimal design parameters, excluding the
action limit and the warning limit, are insensitive to the m
value. The optimal action limit and warning limit narrow
down as the m value increases. But it remains almost
constant as long as m value goes beyond Nedumaran and
Pignatiello’s lower bound: 800p/3(n1).
6. Concluding remarks
The VP T2 control chart illustrates that simultaneously
varying the sample size, the sampling interval, and the action
limit between maximum and minimum values according to
the prior sample point on the chart has signiﬁcantly
improved the speed of traditional FSR T2 control chart in
response to a small shift in a multivariate process mean. For
the sake of operating the VP T2 control chart more
efﬁciently, we conduct the economic design of the VP T2
chart, assuming the in-control process mean vector and
covariance matrix are unknown. The cost function deve-
loped here can be used to evaluate the economic perfor-
mance of the VP T2 control chart. The assumption that the
assignable cause occurs according to an exponential
distribution allows us to obtain the cost function by means
of the Markov chain approach. The optimal design
parameters of the VP T2 control chart that minimize the
cost function are discovered through GAs. The results of
economic design of the FSR T2 control chart are compared
with that of the VP T2 control chart. The comparison shows
that the VP control chart outperforms the FSR control chart
in terms of the operating cost and has the advantage of
diminishing false alarm rate. In the sensitivity analysis of the
number of initial samples for estimating the unknown in-
control process mean vector and covariance matrix, the
results of economic design of the VP T2 control chart appear
fairly insensitive as long as the number of initial samples
beyond the lower bound of the range recommended by
Nedumaran and Pignatiello (1999). Just as it is essential to
monitor the process mean vector, it is also essential to
monitor the process variability. Therefore, a joint economic
model where both mean and variance shifts are considered
seems to be an interesting topic for future research.
