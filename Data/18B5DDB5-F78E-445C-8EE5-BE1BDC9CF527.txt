1Abstract
This paper extends the single machine scheduling problem from single common
due date to multiple common due dates, accompanied by a stepwise non-increasing
amount of profit. By assuming the penalty function common to all jobs, we consider
two cases of penalty for late jobs. When the penalty is a fixed amount in respect of a
due date, then sequencing jobs in the SPT order could give an optimal solution. The
other case is when a fixed rate is penalized. This case can be solved by dividing it by
the common due dates into a series of sub-problems, each of which is equivalent to
the traditional 0-1 knapsack problem.

3several approximation algorithms to locate its near-optimal solutions. Since a late
delivery for an order may need an expedited transportation, then aggregating other
orders into this transportation should be practical to cut down the loss for this late
delivery. As a result, there possibly exists a set of due dates that are common to all
jobs.
In this paper, we address the problem that a set of n jobs need to be processed on
a single machine, where each job is associated with the m-stepwise non-decreasing
tardy cost corresponding to m common due dates. For ease of discussion, we
transform the stepwise non-decreasing tardiness cost into the stepwise non-increasing
profit, such that an equivalent model of maximizing total profit of jobs will be
presented.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a mathematical model of the
problem, in the formulation of integer programming. Then, two special cases are
defined in Section 3, one of which does admit a polynomial algorithm. Eventually,
Section 4 gives a concluding remark.
2. Preliminaries
We consider the problem where n given jobs should be processed on a single
machine. For each job },,2,1{ nNj  , it has an associated processing time jp .
Common to all jobs, m due dates id for mi ,,2,1  are specified in the order of
mddd  21 . Whenever job j is completed during the due date window
],( 1 ii dd  (i.e., its completion time jC satisfies iji dCd 1 ), we say job j is
completed at stage i for short, and then the amount of profit jiw , will be earned.
Considering the amounts of profit at m stages for job j are stepwise
non-increasing, the conclusion that jmjj www ,,2,1   can be made. With these
assumptions, our task is to arrange n jobs into m disjoint sets i for
mi ,,2,1  , such that each jobs in set i is completed at stage i , and the total
profit gained from completing all n jobs is maximized. For convenience, this
multiple common due dates problem is abbreviated as MCDP. Thus we may formally
formulate the MCDP as below:
5Therefore, we prove that jsililsiji wwww ,,,,   , justifying the interchanging. In
addition, this interchanging would not harm the profit of other jobs, due to the
condition lj pp  . The proof of this property is completed.□
Next, we discuss two special cases, resulting from the simplification of penalty
for late jobs.
3. Two special Cases of the MCDP
3.1. MCDP I: ijji www , for mi ,,1 and nj ,,1 , where
mwwww  321 0 .
This case assumes an amount of original profit jw for job j if it is completed
no later than the first common due date 1d ; otherwise, the job, as completed at stage
i , is punished with a profit loss iw . While the profit loss is dependent on stages, it
is common to all jobs. This may be illustrated with the examples of
less-than-truckload (LTL) and expedited transportation that charges a fixed cost for a
range of container size. With this assumption, the objective function (1) in the
formulation of MCDP can be induced as below.

Since the sum of the original profits of all jobs is constant and
mwwww  321 0 , objective function (5) under constraint (2) is
maximized by arranging as many jobs as possible into the early stages. This leads to
sequencing jobs in the order of shortest processing time (SPT).
This case demonstrates that the SPT sequence of jobs can maximize the total
profit of the MCDP if all jobs’sizes are in such a range that a fixed cost iw is
charged for a certain type of expedited transportation referring to due date id . This
implies the MCDP I is polynomial solvable.

Different from the above case that a fixed amount of penalty is charged for each
stage, this case assumes a fixed rate for each stage. When a job is completed at stage

This paper extends the single machine scheduling problem from single common
due date to multiple common due dates, accompanied by a stepwise non-increasing
amount of profit. In such a scenario, our concern is how to assign jobs into the due
date windows in order to maximize their total profit. Referring to the practices for late
delivery, this paper designs two cases of penalty that is charged for a job when it is
completed behind of the first common due date. One is that the penalty for each due
date is a fixed amount for late jobs. For this case, we prove sequencing jobs in the
SPT order could give an optimal solution. The other case is when a fixed rate of
original profit of a job is penalized for each due date. This case also can be easily
solved by dividing it by the due dates into a series of sub-problems, each of which is
equivalent to the traditional 0-1 knapsack problem. No matter which case is
concerned, the amount or rate of penalty for each due date is common to all jobs.
The results from the two cases provide insight into how to schedule a set of jobs
with stepwise non-increasing profit, subject to multiple common due dates. With the
foundation, a further development of research on the MCDP could consider the case
when the penalty or multiple due dates are job-dependent, or make other extension
about machine configuration and performance measures more general than the topic
we consider here.
