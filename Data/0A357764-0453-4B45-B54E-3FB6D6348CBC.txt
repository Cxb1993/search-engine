PLASTIC	HINGE	LENGTH	OF	CORRODED	REINFORCED	CONCRETE	BEAMS	
 
Abstract 
A two-dimensional (2D) non-linear finite element analysis method is developed in this research to analyze the 
mechanical behavior of reinforced concrete beams with corroded steel reinforcement. The method is validated using 
several experimental data from literatures. A parametric study is carried out to examine the influences of concrete 
compressive strength, bond deterioration and shear span-to-depth ratios on the mechanical responses of beams with 
corroded longitudinal reinforcement. Results of the study show that, in addition to reducing beam flexural strength, 
corrosion alters the failure mode and affects the ductile behavior substantially. The effects of corrosion on the beam 
plastic hinge length are discussed towards the end of this report. 
Keywords: Reinforced concrete beams; Corrosion; Non-linear finite element analysis; flexural strength; ductility; 
plastic hinge length. 
 
1. Introduction 
Reinforcement corrosion is identified as the most predominant factor of deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) 
structures which seriously affects their serviceability and durability. Damage to the concrete occurs in the form of 
cracking and eventual spalling of cover concrete, reduction in cross section of the reinforcement bars, and reduction in 
the bond strength at the interfacial zone of reinforcement and concrete. 
Over the past few decades, much researcher has been conducted to study the effect of corrosion on the mechanical 
behavior of concrete beams or slabs by using accelerated corrosion tests [1-5] in which the reinforcing bars in concrete 
beams or slabs were corroded electrochemically over their whole length before the beam or slab specimens were simply 
supported and then loaded to failure under either two point load or uniform loads. On the basis of their experimental 
results, these researchers reported that although their non-corroded beams failure in flexure, their corroded beams failed 
either in shear, in shear-compression, or by bond ineffectiveness. Furthermore, Rodiguez et al. [1] reported that beam 
strength was decreased by 22.73% associated with approximately 13.7% corrosion, while Yingang Du et al. [5] stated 
that beam strength was reduced by 9.79% as a result of 10% corrosion. Regarding beam ductility, according to data of 
Yingang Du [5] who reported that due to only 10% corrosion transformed the failure mode of the very under-reinforced 
beams from a ductile manner to a brittle manner due to rupture of corroded tension bars. For over-reinforced beams, the 
failure mode is less brittle manner, or even more ductile manner. 
It is clear that, although all of the aforementioned researchers agreed that corrosion did change beams’ failure 
modes and affect their strengths, completely consistent results have not been achieved regarding the magnitude of the 
effect of corrosion on beam strength. Furthermore, little research has been done on the ductility of corroded beams 
because most researchers have mainly focused their attention on beam strength rather than on beam ductility. This 
research reports a study of concrete beams with corroded reinforcement using finite element method (DIANA program) 
to investigate their failure modes and ductility behavior. The main research variables were the area, the location (tension, 
compression, or link reinforcement) of the reinforcement to be corroded, and the degree of corrosion. 
 
2. Research objective 
The plastic hinge length is a critical parameter for seismic analysis and design of reinforced concrete structures. 
Plastic hinge length formulations which have been proposed by many researchers always use non-corroded reinforcing 
bars for their models. However in the real application, beams and column sometimes build under the corroded 
environment. In both earthquake resistant and moment redistribution design, reducing the area of tension 
reinforcements can guarantee significant rotation of a plastic hinge at the critical section of a structure and the structure 
can fail in a very ductile manner. If such structures were subsequently to suffer from steel corrosion, however, they 
could fail in a very brittle manner, due to the possible fracture of corroded bars and reduction of bond strength. Hence, it 
is suggested that care should be taken in the design of such structures that are located in seismic regions and which may 
be damaged by steel corrosion. The amount of steel remaining, after probable corrosion within the life of structure has 
occurred should still be sufficient to maintain the minimum ductility required. The part of the study presented here is 
focused on effect of deterioration on plastic hinge length. 
 
3. Research method 
The study uses two-dimensional (2D) non-linear finite element analysis to analysis the mechanical of concrete 
beams with corroded reinforcement to investigate their failure modes and ductility behavior. This can be done by 
assuming that the methods of structural analysis in use for concrete structures can be applied to the corroded RC 
structures considering effect of corrosion on material properties. In detail, the following aspects should be considered to 
analyze the mechanical behavior and remaining load-carrying capacity of corroded RC structures.

of the concrete in compression, because of cover cracking and bond deterioration (c) change in tension stiffening

ସ   (4) 
where ௦ܰ	is the number of steel bars, D଴ is the original diameter of steel bars, n takes into account the possibility of a 
one-side or two side corrosion attack and x is the corrosion depth in the reinforcement.  
The residual cross-sectional area of locally corroded reinforcement was first estimated with the experimentally 
verified assumption that the maximum penetration of pitting corrosion is about four to eight times the average corrosion 
penetration of uniform corrosion, see Gonzalez et al [25]. 
 
4.2.2 Residual strength of corrosion damaged steel 
Several studies investigated the effect of uniform corrosion on the mechanical properties of reinforcement. 
Almusallam [26] summarized some experimental results and reported that the strength ratio and elastic modulus of 
reinforcement are not significantly affected by uniform corrosion. The reduction on both the yield strength and the 
ultimate strength of steel bars ranged about 5 to 10% of the original bars. An agreement was supported by Y. G. Du et al 
[27]. Y. G. Du et al [27] recommended that the strength of corroded reinforcement can be expressed generally as:   
 f ൌ ሺ1 െ βAୡ୭୰୰ሻf଴  (5) 
where β is strength factor; f଴	is strength of the non-corroded bar (the yield and ultimate strength); f is strength of the 
corroded bar; Aୡ୭୰୰ is amount of corrosion of reinforcement % in term of weight loss. As examined by significant tests 
according to Y. G. Du, β ൌ 0.005 should be used. In this research, equations Eq. (5) was employed to propose the 
constitutive laws for corroded reinforcement for the FEM analysis of corroded RC members.  
 
4.2.3 Residual ductility of corrosion damaged steel 
There is general consensus that the mechanical behavior of reinforcing bars changes from ductile to non-ductile as 
corrosion loss increases. What is less clear is the level of corrosion loss when the mechanical behavior transitions from 
ductile to non-ductile behavior and how this is affected by steel type. Concerning the ductility, accelerated tests 
performed by Andrade et al [29] have shown reductions in the elongation at maximum load of 30% and 50% for cross 
section losses of 15% and 28%, respectively. The experimental studies of Almusallam [26] have evidenced that the 
ductility reduction is generally associated with the tendency for notch formation in the steel bar with increasing 
corrosion, which is a typical condition of pitting corrosion. Almusallam [26] found brittle behavior when corrosion loss 
exceed 12.6%. Quite different results have been recently obtained by Al Hashemi et al [30] who evidenced a strong loss 
of ductility (greater than 60% respect to the sound sample) in bars suffering from uniform corrosion, while a localized 
corrosion seemed to produce only a significant decrease of fatigue performance. Furthermore, Palsson and Mirza  [31] 
has found that the average ductility of the bars is progressively impaired, and when pitting reaches 50% of the section, 
bar behavior become very brittle. Apostolopoulos and Michalopoulos [32] observed that the additional plastic strain 
associated with corroded bent stirrup had significantly reduced ductility when compared to straight corroded stirrups. 
Such results highlight that the effect of corrosion need further investigations to complete understand the phenomenon. 
With respect to uniform corrosion, practical models for the residual ductility of corroded reinforcement are 
confined to empirical correlation with a cross-sectional loss of the corroded reinforcement. Such relationships have been 
presented in different forms, such as following equation: 
 	εୱ୳ᇱ ൌ ሺ1 െ αଵAୡ୭୰ሻεୱ୳଴ 	 ሺ6ሻ	
where	εୱ୳ᇱ  is the ultimate strain of corroded reinforcement, with the average cross-sectional loss of Aୡ୭୰ expressed as a percentage of the original cross section; εୱ୳଴	represents the ultimate strain of non-corroded reinforcement; and αଵ is an 
empirical coefficient. Depending on different exposure environments, carbonation, or chlorides, the reported 
ߙଵ coefficient varies from 0 to 0.06. A summary of the αଵ  coefficient determined from various experimental investigations is available in the literature [33]. As suggested by Zandi Hanjari [34], the value αଵ ൌ 0.017 was used this study. 
With respect to pitting corrosion, the residual cross-sectional area of locally corroded reinforcement was first 
estimated with the experimentally verified assumption that the maximum penetration of pitting corrosion is 
approximately four to eight times the average corrosion penetration of uniform corrosion [25]. Based on the assumption 
of the circular cross section of pits, the cross-sectional loss at pit increases approximately in proportion to the square of 
its depth. In this study, the pit configuration proposed by Val and Melchers [35] was used to calculate the residual area 
locally corroded reinforcement. The notch effect in a locally corroded reinforcement induces large and localized strain in 
the bar. Because the length of the bar affected by pitting corrosion is short, approximately two times the diameter bat in 
total [36], the average strain of the bar is smaller than local strain at the pit. Hence, the bar fails at an average strain 
smaller than the ultimate strain of the non-corroded bar [17, 33] and the average ductility of the bar is impaired.  The 
ultimate strain of locally corroded reinforcement reduced much more significantly then the yield and ultimate strength 
[33, 36]. In this research the effect of pitting corrosion on steel bar ductility has been introduced in the model by 
adopting the approach recently proposed by Coronelli et al [17]. According to such an approach the steel ultimate strain 
εୱ୳ᇱ 	may be considered as linearly dependent on the reduction of the bar cross-section. In particular, by defining α୮୧୲the 
percent of reduction of the bar cross-section as: 
 5 
into X-tract [43] is required for longitudinal reinforcement only. Bond degradation consideration in this assessment is 
proposed in this research to be expressed as a modified factor Φ to modify the strain of the longitudinal steel. The 
modified factor is the ratio of Lୣ୳  which is assumed as equivalent unbounded length of the bar with the strain 
distribution due to Slip Elongation S୉ from the joint. The lengths of the strain distribution calculation Lୢ can be 
derived from bond stress equilibrium equation.

where Lୢଵ is length of the strain distribution when fୱ ൑ f୷; Lୢଶ is length of the strain distribution when fୱ ൐ f୷; fୱ is 
stress of the steel at the correlated strain of the sound bar; dୠ is original longitudinal bar diameter (initial corrosion). 
Slip elongation ES is calculated as follows:

From those parameters the Lୣ୳ can be formed with Eq. (14) for each steel strain value and the modified factor to 
modify strain of the steel is shown in Eq. (15) and Eq. (16)

The equivalent unbounded length is calculated as an average of strain steel properties from 0 up to 0.6εୱ୳ where εୱ୳ is ultimate strain of steel in initial condition (without corrosion) and only applied for longitudinal steel properties. 
The ultimate conditions in the sectional analysis are defined as follows. 
(1) The first ultimate condition was relating to rebar fracture (including buckling and fatigue effect) as defined when 
the peak rebar strain reached εୱ୳ ൌ 0.12 (for non-corroded bar) and εୱ୳ᇱ  following Eq. (6) and Eq. (8) This value 
of fracture strain was obtained from the verification study as mentioned previously. 
(2) The second ultimate condition was reached when the peak compressive strain of confined concrete reached the 
strain as defined by the following equation. 
	 εୱ୳ ൌ 0.004 ൅ ଵ.ସ஡౩୤౯౞க౩ౣ୤ౙౙᇲ 	 	 ሺ17ሻ	
where ௬݂௛ = yield strength of the transverse reinforcement; ߝ௦௠ = ultimate strain of the transverse reinforcement was 
obtained from the verification study as mentioned previously ; ௖݂௖ᇱ  =  ultimate confined concrete strength.  
 
6. Model verification 
 To establish the validity of the material model, correlative studies of the analytical results and experimental test 
results were undertaken, and are presented in the following section. 
 
6.1 Modeling of reinforcement and concrete-reinforcement interaction 
 The longitudinal reinforcement was modeled by two-node truss elements. The concrete beam was modeled by 
means of four-node quadrilateral iso-parametric plane stress elements with their thickness being equal to the width of the 
beam. The concrete is modeled with a smeared crack model. The total strain fixed crack model and the rotating crack 
model were employed in the finite element analyses in order to investigate structural response. Interaction between the 
reinforcement and the concrete was modeled with a bond-slip relation. Interface elements, describing the bond-slip 
behavior in term of a relation between the traction and the relative displacements, were used across the reinforcement 
and concrete interface. The bond-slip relation followed methodology described above. The same relation was adapted 
also for damaged beams. The stirrups and compressive steel were embedded in the concrete elements, corresponding to 
a perfect bond between stirrups and concrete. The embedded stirrup adds stiffness to the concrete elements; their strain 
is calculated from the displacement field of the place stress elements. A regular Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm is 
used in which loading is applied by means of displacement control in a four point bending. 
 
6.2 Analysis of a plain concrete beam 
A plain concrete beam was chosen for the numerical analysis [44]. The test specimen, which had the dimensions 
1200mm long x 125 mm high x 100 mm wide, as subjected to a four point bending load, as show in Fig. 3. The material 
properties of the plain concrete beam that was used in the analyses was a concrete with Poison’s ratio ߥ ൌ 0.2, concrete 
tensile strength ௧݂ ൌ 2.6	ܯܲܽ  tensile fracture energy ܩ௙ூ ൌ 0.12	ܰ/݉݉  , concrete compressive strength  ௖݂ᇱᇱ ൌ
37.2	ܯܲܽ. The constitutive law for concrete have to be modified due to size effect as previously mentioned. The 
calculated initial stiffness and failure mode of the structure is similar to that of experiment, and the structural 
load-carrying capacity is predicted near the same with the experimental result.

The result from the finite element analyses and experiment are presented and compared in three groups with respect 
to the governing failure mode of the beams. It can be explained that the difference in initial stiffness between the 
experimental and the numerical load-deflection curves of the tested beams at low load levels can be due to some 
cracking appeared before testing, result in reduced beam stiffness (On the contrary, numerical models are un-cracked at 
the beginning of the analysis). The appearances of cracking are attributed to the thermal and shrinkage cracking in the 
experimental beams, and the experimental set-up.

7.2 Effect of bond deterioration on flexural strength and Lp 
The effect of bond deterioration is examined for two different corrosion scenarios. Corrosion activity (i.e. anodic 
areas in a macro-cell) is likely to be at its highest near flexural cracks (due to loading), where the access of chlorides, 
water and oxygen to the rebars, is easier. Material properties for beams in this case are shown in Table 7.

Bond deterioration did not affect the yield/ultimate load capacity in any of the examined beams, as seen from Fig. 
12 and Fig. 13. The ultimate displacement is nearly the same between all of analyzed beams. The predicted plastic 
hinge length increases when bond strength reduces. The main reason for this trend is that corrosion changes the steel 
properties, which is used to calculate yield and ultimate curvature. 
 
7.3 Effect of corrosion level on flexural strength and Lp 
The compressive strength of concrete is a key factor in defining the timing of compressive concrete crushing for 
beams damaged by corrosion in their compressive zone. As shown in previous section, this affects the flexural 
performance of the beams; hence this aspect is investigated in detail here. From the results in Fig. 17, it can be realized 
that plastic hinge length of corroded reinforced concrete beams are strongly affected. The main reason is due to the 
reduction of reinforcement ductility.

increasing crack spacing and widths. Consequently, modeling bond deterioration is highly significant for 
performance assessment at serviceability limit state. Plastic hinge length enlarges when bond strength is 
deducted. 
(5) In this study, considering uniform corrosion predicts the load-deflection curve quite well. The ductility reduction 
of the corroded reinforcing bar and the variability of pitting corrosion which affected the prediction of the failure 
load need to be further investigated.
