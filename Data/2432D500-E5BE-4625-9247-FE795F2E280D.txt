Abstract—Opportunistic relaying has been recently proposed
to eliminate the need of symbol synchronization and challenging
code design in distributed space-time coded (DSTC) coopera-
tion yet achieving the same diversity multiplexing tradeoff. In
opportunistic relaying, the relay terminal that possesses the best
relay-destination channel quality is selected by the destination for
cooperative forwarding. Combining opportunistic relaying with
the automatic-retransmission request (ARQ) protocol that has
already been used to recover the transmission error can further
improve the communication reliability in error-prone wireless
channels. However, the relay selection process taking place in
the scale of the channel coherence time gives rise to additional
delay. Furthermore, each relay terminal needs to perform error
detection on a per frame basis to determine its eligibility for
cooperative relaying. The caused overhead may be fast accumu-
lated as the data rate increases. In this paper, we propose a fast
relay selection protocol that selects the assisting relay without
using any extra signaling than existing ARQ protocols. Only
channel state information (CSI) available at the receiver side
is required to perform the selection. We theoretically analyze
the proposed scheme, and verify the accuracy of the theoretical
analysis through simulations. Numerical results show that, the
proposed scheme outperforms the classical ARQ protocols in
terms of outage probabilities, using the same amount of signaling.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years various cooperative mechanisms have been
proposed to realize cooperative diversity for different types
of networks. To jointly exploit spatial and temporal diversity,
Laneman and Wornell [1] proposed distributed space-time
coding (DSTC)-based cooperation and showed it outperforms
repetition-based scheme in terms of spectral efficiencies. How-
ever, cooperation based on DSTC requires extensive informa-
tion exchange among all potential relays and they need to
transmit coherently.
Alternatively, selection relaying, whereby one relay is se-
lected for cooperative forwarding, eliminates the need of
complex synchronization among multiple nodes and simplifies
signaling procedure. Various selection criteria for cooperative
relaying have been reported in the literature. Relay selection
can be based on relative locations, average or instantaneous
channel state. The selection based on the relative location is
assumed in [2], where the relay closest to the destination is
chosen, with the aid of global positioning system (GPS). In
fact, the closest relay is helpful only when it receives the
correct copy of the original information. Thus, limiting the
potential relay to those that can successfully decode, known
as the decoding set [1], is suggested in [3] for decode-and-
forward cooperative diversity systems. On the other hand, the
channel state information (CSI) available at the receiving node
can be readily used to facilitate relay selection. Depending on
the amount of CSI available, relay selection algorithms have
be established based on statistical [4], [5] or instantaneous
CSI [6], [7]. Particularly, the notion of opportunistic relaying
is suggested in [7], where the relay terminal with the best
instantaneous relay-destination channel quality is selected for
assisting the transmission from the source terminal. It is
shown that opportunistic relaying offers the same diversity-
multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) as obtained by the more complex
DSTC cooperation.
Several protocols based on opportunistic relaying have
been proposed to explore cooperative diversity. A contention-
based selection protocol is adopted in [7], where the assisting
relay is selected via the ready-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-
send (CTS) dialogue before data transmission. While Such
a proactive selection only need to be executed in the scale
of the channel coherence time, it becomes unnecessary if
the source can successfully transmit the information. In [8],
the relay selection, taking place after data transmission, is
triggered by the negative acknowledgement (NACK) inherent
in the automatic-retransmission request (ARQ) protocol. The
relay terminals in the decoding set send a one-bit packet
indicating their status to the destination, and the destination
picks the partner for cooperative relaying using the same
policy as in [7]. As the size of decoding set increases, a
longer duration for the signaling between the relays and the
destinations would be expected, regardless contention-based
or slotted medium access control (MAC) is used. In addition,
the proposed protocol limits the number of retransmission
to one for analysis tractability without practical implication.
In [9] and [10], generalized cooperative ARQ protocol with
retry limit more than one have been considered, but DSTC
cooperation is assumed in their work. [11] also considers
a generalized cooperative protocol, where the relay is pre-
determined. To the best of our knowledge, a generalized
cooperative ARQ protocol for non-DSTC cooperation has not
been reported in the literature.
of feasible relays. Certain time slots may be idle resulting in
inefficient channel usage. While the channel efficiency can be
improved by using contention-based MAC mechanisms, the
time for resolving the possible collisions is non-deterministic.
As in [7], each relay maintains a local back-off timer to decide
when should they send their status to the destination. The
best relay is supposed to run out the timer earlier than others
and thus being selected. In addition to uncertain duration
of the selection process, the timer value also contributes
to resulting delay. Therefore, contention-based selection may
not be suitable for delay-sensitive applications. The similar
problem occurs if we let the relays to contend for relaying, as
considered in [8].
Alternatively, we can leave the decision to individual relay
based on their local information. As such, selecting the best
relay involves the knowledge of the channel gains of each r−d
channel, which requires a significant amount of information
exchange. We propose to let relays decide whether to assist
the source with a certain probability. As long as a relay can
decode the information from the source, it would help to
forward the information with a probability, denoted as τ , after
hearing the NACK. However, not every relay in the decoding
set can be really helpful, because some or all of them may
have a weak r−d channel. In the information-theoretic sense,
the cooperation between a source and a relay after diversity
combining at the destination forms an equivalent channel,
whose mutual information, denoted as Icoop, is
Icoop = 12 log2
(
1 + SNR(|hs,d|2 + |hr,d|2)
)
. (1)
For a prescribed spectral efficiency R, the relay r is useful
if Icoop ≥ R/2, in case of incremental transmission. In other
words, the relays that possess a weak r−d channel should not
participate in the probabilistic relay selection process to avoid
unnecessary collisions. For example, relays that are close to
the source have a higher chance to decode the information, but
they may be far away from the destination, and thus become
not useful in cooperative combining. Thus, the actual assisting
relay should be selected from the strong decoding set, which
consists of those relays in the decoding set with the r−d chan-
nel gain greater than a certain threshold. Various approaches
can be used to determine the threshold, for example, based on
the SNR measurement, the instantaneous channel gain or the
channel statistics estimated at the destination. For example, we
determine the threshold, denoted by β, from the information-
theoretical, i.e., based on (1),
|hr,d|2 ≥ 2
R − 1
SNR
− |hs,d|2 = β. (2)
In practice, the threshold can be determined based on the
underlying coding rates and modulation schemes used [13]. In
summary, the proposed probabilistic relay selection protocol
is stated as follows (Fig. 1):
1) Round 1: The source transmits a packet.
2) Round 2: If the destination correctly decode the mes-
sage, it broadcasts an ACK and the protocol returns
to Step 1. Otherwise, the destination computes the

threshold β and piggybacks it with the NACK to be
broadcasted.
3) Upon receiving the NACK, the relays that have success-
fully decoded the packet determine if they are eligible
to forward the packet. If (2) holds, the relay starts
forwarding the decoded packet with probability τ , or
keeping silent with probability 1− τ .
4) The destination combines the packets received in the
successive rounds. If it can decode the information, it
broadcasts an ACK and returns to Step 1. If exact one
relay forwards the packet, but the destination can not
decode after combining, the destination broadcasts an
NACK, requesting the assisting relay chosen in Setp
3 to retransmit in the next round. If more than one
relays forward the packet leading to collisions, the
destination broadcasts the NACK, requesting the source
to retransmit in the next round.
5) The protocol proceeds until an ACK is issued by the
destination or the retry limit is reached.
Notice that in Step 4, the destination will assign the source for
retransmission, if collisions occur. Outage can be reduced if
we keep performing the relay selection using the rule in Step
3. Also, diversity can be further explored if all relays continue
listening and trying to combine the received information as the
protocol proceeds, and thus increase the size of decoding set.
Furthermore, multiple relays can forward the packet simul-
taneously if each is assigned with a unique spreading code
as suggested in [14]. Here the proposed protocol reveals the
simplest form of its kind, aiming at simple implementation
and reducing the energy consumption to the maximum extent.
In our protocol, relays only need to hear and possibly decode
the transmission of the first round, except the assisting relay.
We can also optimize the protocol performance by adjusting
the transmission probability of relays according to the channel
quality and the network density.
The proposed probabilistic relaying is compared with the
opportunistic relaying using Table I. While opportunistic
relying achieves full diversity, it incurs a larger signaling
overhead due to the use of RTS-CTS handshakes for relay
selection. In probabilistic relaying, simply relying on a thresh-
old value to examine the eligibility of relays for cooperative
combining does not ensure the diversity order. On the other
hand, relays might be hidden from each other that requires
additional signaling to resolve protocol failure. Relay decision
in opportunistic relaying is made prior to data transmission
landing itself a proactive approach, whereas it is reactive in
D(s) in which D̂(s) is a subset of D(s). Then Pr[D̂(s)] can
be derived as
Pr[D̂(s)] =
∑
DU(s)
∏
r∈D̂(s)
Pr[|hr,d|2 > β]
×
∏
r∈DU(s)\D̂(s)
Pr[|hr,d|2 < β]× Pr[DU(s)],
(13)
where
Pr[DU(s)] =
∏
r∈DU(s)
Pr[Is,r > R]
∏
r/∈DU(s)
Pr[Is,r < R]. (14)
Combining (12), (13), and (14), we can obtain p0. Similarly,
the probability of exact one assisting relay can be given by
p1 =
∑
D̂(s)
(|D̂(s)|
1
)
τ(1− τ)|D̂(s)|−1 Pr[D̂(s)]. (15)
Therefore, the outage probability of l rounds of direct trans-
mission is given as
Pdout =Pr[Is,d(l) <
R
l
]×
(
Pr[|D̂(s)| = 0]
+ Pr[|A| > 0](1− Pr[|D̂(s)| = 0])
)
, (16)
where Pr[Is,d(l) < Rl ] has been given in (4).
B. Cooperative Relaying
Cooperative relaying occurs when exact one relay in the
strong decoding set attempts to help forwarding. Thus, the
outage probability depends on the assisting relay, denoted
as r∗. Following the same notation in analyzing the direct
transmission, let D(r∗|s) denote the decoding set containing
r∗, D̂(r∗|s) the strong decoding set, and DU (r∗|s) the superset
set of D(r∗|s). The probability of a particular assisting relay
can be obtained as
Pr[r∗] =
∑
D̂(r∗|s)
τ(1− τ)|D̂(r∗|s)|−1 Pr[D̂(r∗|s)], (17)
and Pr[D̂(r∗|s)] the probability of a particular strong decoding
set that contains r∗ is computed similar to (13) and (14).
Finally, the outage probability of l rounds of cooperative
transmission is
Pcoopout =
∑
r∗
Pr[Icoop(l) <
R
l
] Pr[r∗](1− Pr[|D̂(s)| = 0]) · p1,
(18)
where we use the results in (6), (7), (10), and (15).
We note that our analysis focuses on outage probability,
while the successful probability at the l-th round can be
obtained as Pout(l − 1) − Pout(l), for l = 1, · · · , L and
Pout(0) = 1, using the same argument in [9].
Fig. 2: Outage probabilities vs. SNR. L = 3, τ = 0.3.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we demonstrate the outage performance
of the proposed probabilistic selection cooperation protocol
using the analytical equations derived in the previous section.
The analytical results are also validated by comparing with
simulation ones. All numerical and simulation results are
obtained using the following parameters: 5 relays with source-
relay channel quality set to λs,r = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2] and relay-
destination channel quality λr,d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; the source-
destination channel λs,d = 5; the prescribed spectral efficiency
R = 2 b/s/Hz; the SNR values of interest range from 1
dB to 25 dB. The proposed selection cooperation protocol
is compared with direct transmission without cooperation,
which we call Direct scheme, equivalent to the lower-bound
of the proposed scheme; and the opportunistic relay selection
proposed in [7], where the best relay with the strongest relay-
destination channel is selected for single-round relaying. Here
we generalize the scheme proposed [7] by allowing multiple
retransmissions and call it the Optimal scheme, serving as the
upper-bound of the proposed scheme.
In Fig. 2, we show the outage probabilities of the proposed
scheme with varied SNR for L = 3 and τ = 0.3. Both
analytical and simulation results are shown, and compared
with two schemes: Direct and Optimal. As shown in the
figure, the outage improvement of the proposed scheme over
the Direct scheme is evident in the medium-to-high SNR
region (10 ∼ 25 dB), but it does not achieve full diversity
as the Optimal scheme does. In low-to-medium SNR regime
(1 ∼ 5 dB), the proposed scheme performs comparably to
the Optimal scheme. The performance loss of the proposed
scheme compared to the Optimal scheme can be interpreted
as the outcome of collisions due to multiple strong relays.
From this figure, we can see that the proposed protocol trades
higher outage comparing to the Optimal scheme for simple
protocol operation. Despite the performance loss, the proposed
scheme improves conventional HARQ protocols using nearly

1 About IEEE Globecom
IEEE GLOBECOM 2009 is one of the greatest events in the area of communications.
Through its annual event, researchers from industry and academia gather to share
experiences and innovative ideas. True to its acronym, GLOBECOM has been located
in many regions of the world, including Singapore, England, Brazil and several sites
in the US and will be in Washington DC in 2007. It takes place annually, typically
in November.
This year, the conference is featured by comprehensive technical program including
11 Symposia and 24 Tutorials and 10 Workshops. IEEE GLOBECOM 2009 also
includes an attractive expo program including keynote speakers, various Business,
Technology and Industry fora, and vendor exhibits.
Among many emerging topics, cooperative communication has draw notable at-
tention, and the conference has received a large number of related papers this year.
This is evident from the fact that nine sub-topics are organized under the umbrella of
cooperative communications: beamforming, cellular network, signal processing, relay
techniques, relay selection, power and resource allocation, distributed modulation and
coding, performance analysis, and coding for cooperative communications.

3 Recommendations and What I Learned
A number of things are worth mentioning. Firstly, Dr. Mehta showed a quite promis-
ing way of doing presentation. He started with giving the motivation, instead of the
layout as most people would do for starting their talk. By motivating the audience,
it becomes nature when he went further to talk about the math. Another advantage
of his talk is that he relied on a lot of pictorial explanations to assist his elabora-
tion. Secondly, when talking with several colleagues, we surprising found that most
of us are too busy to meet back in Taiwan. International conferences serve a good
chance to bring us together. Unfortunately, not many our students were attending
the conference, either because of the low acceptance rate of Globecom or the budget
issue. Contrarily, a majority of student attendees from China, Hong Kong, Japan,
and Europe have been observed. Though NSC has been encouraging students to
attend international conferences by supporting student travel grant. One way or an-
other we should better improve our student participation visibility in international
events. Perhaps some surveys toward graduate students and their supervisors can be
helpful to understand the cause of low participation rate. Myself will definitely pro-
mote IEEE student memberships and encourage students to engage in the research
society.

In this work, we propose a fast relay selection protocol for
half-duplex cooperative networks. Such a consideration falls
in the scenario of typical sensor and ad hoc networks, where
nodes have very simple hardware with limited processing
capability, and the information is sensitive to transmission
latency. As a result, the time and signaling processing con-
sumed for relay selection have to be reduced to the least
extent. Most previous work on relay selection emphasizes
on achieving the maximum diversity, neglecting the cost
resulted from selection process, namely, signaling overhead
and latency. In this work, we propose a fast selection protocol
where relays distributively decide whether to forward the
overheard information. To reduce collisions, only the relays
in the decoding set with the strong relay-destination channel
are allowed to make the forwarding decisions. To this end, the
CSI available at the destination terminal is used to determine
a threshold, which is piggybacked with the NACK packet, so
that relays can determine if they are feasible for relaying the
information preventing from error propagation. Although the
proposed protocol does not achieve the full diversity, as those
employing DSTC or selecting the best relay through extensive
signaling, we show that, the proposed relay selection provides
an improved performance over direct transmissions, without
introducing additional signaling overhead to the existing ARQ
protocols. Thus, our work provides a means of allowing
immediate implementation of cooperative protocols in existing
systems.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
section II, we present our system model. The proposed relay
selection protocol is presented in Section III. The outage per-
formance of the proposed protocol is analyzed in Section IV,
followed by the numerical results in Section V. Conclusions
are given in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a network with M + 2 single-antenna nodes,
where an information source s transmits to a destination d
at a rate of R, and the remaining nodes denoted by M =
{1, 2, · · · ,M} as the cooperating relays for the target link,
as shown in Fig. 1. All terminals are restricted to half-duplex
radio, and cooperating relays employ decode-and-forward as
the forwarding disciline. The channel hi,j between nodes
i and j is modeled as zero-mean, independent, circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian random variables with variance
1/λi,j , leading to Rayleigh fading channel, i.e., |hi,j |2 follow
exponential distribution with parameter λi,j . We assume long-
term static channel where the fading channel gain of each
link stays constant over the entire packet transmission process.
In addition, all s − r channels are assumed be identical and
independent from each other, and all r − d channels are
identical and independent as well. Each node transmits with
power P . Denote N0 as the noise power, the non-faded signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) can be represented as ρ = P/N0.
The MAC is assumed to be contention-free, e.g., time divi-
sion multiple access (TDMA), for simplicity. Transmission er-
rors may occur when the channel quality is not strong enough

to achieve the required rate. Hybrid-automatic-retransmission
request (HARQ) protocol is performed at the link layer to
enhance reliability. The system is assumed to provide a low-
rate, error-free feedback from the destination to the relays and
possibly to the source. Similar to [8], type-I H-ARQ with
packet combining is considered. Here altruistic cooperation,
implying that nodes except s do not generate local data and
thus are always willing to contribute their resource to help,
is assumed for simplicity. Non-altruistic cooperation has been
recently discussed in [12].
III. PROBABILISTIC RELAY SELECTION PROTOCOL
Based on our system model, this section presents the
proposed relay selection protocol. The cooperative relaying
process commences with the source node sending a packet by
broadcasting. The destination replies with an acknowledgment
(ACK) for successful reception. In case the destination fails
to receive the information, it broadcasts an NACK. The
ACK/NACK is assumed to be received error-free. Once receiv-
ing the NACK, each relay first checks if it has successfully
decoded the information previously sent from the source, i.e.,
whether the relay is in the decoding set or not. For the relays
not in the decoding set, they have no means to help the
source. Thus, they will not participate in the cooperation.
For the relays in the decoding set, they can help forward the
information to the destination, which can combine the packets
received in different rounds. An immediate question is, which
relay should be the assisting relay. Furthermore, who should
decide the assisting relay.
If we let the destination to pick the best relay, as in [8], all
feasible relays need to notify the destination about their status.
Accordingly, the destination can estimate the channel gains
between each feasible relays and itself to find the best relay.
Depending on the MAC mechanism, the signaling time may
be either deterministic or non-deterministic. In slotted systems
where mini-slots are used for the signaling, the time for
completing the selection process is a function of the number
probabilistic relaying depending on the quality of the direct
link. Finally, the assisting relay in opportunistic relaying is
selected by the destination according to the feedback from
all relays; it is selected locally in probabilistic relaying using
the piggybacked information from the destination. Quantitative
comparisons for the associated cost of both relaying schemes
are imperative to find the proper operation parameters.
IV. OUTAGE PROBABILITIES
This section analyzes the performance of the proposed
probabilistic selection cooperation protocol in terms of the
outage probability. The outage event occurs if the channel
average mutual information falls below the required spectral
efficiency R. Under the assumption of long-term quasi-static
fading, a packet experiences an identical channel realization
during each transmission round. By combing the packets
received at different rounds, the mutual information due to
direct transmission between s and d at round l is
Isd(l) =
1
l
log2(1 + ρ
l∑
i=1
|hs,d|2)
=
1
l
log2(1 + lρ|hs,d|2). (3)
The outage probability resulted from l rounds of direct trans-
mission can be found as
Pr[ Isd(l) <
R
l
] = Pr[|hs,d|2 < 2
R − 1
lρ
]
= 1− e−λs,db/l, (4)
where b = (2R−1)/ρ, and the outage probability is computed
for a rate R/l in case of incremental transmission due to
information repetition [8].
Successful cooperation occurs when exact one decoding re-
lay, whose r−d channel is strong enough, forwards the packet
to the destination after direct transmission. The combination
of the l cooperative transmissions forms an equivalent channel
between s and d with the mutual information
Icoop(l) =
1
l
log2
(
1 + ρ(|hs,d|2 +

i=2
|hr,d|2)
)
=
1
l
log2
(
1 + ρ(|hs,d|2 + (l − 1)|hr,d|2)
)
. (5)
The corresponding outage probability is thus
Pr[Icoop(l) <
R
l
] = Pr
[|hs,d|2 + (l − 1)|hr,d|2 < b]. (6)
Both |hs,d|2 and |hr,d|2 are exponential random variables
with different means 1/λs,d and 1/λr,d, respectively. For
convenience, define two random variables X and Y , where
X := |hs,d|2 and Y := |hr,d|2. Then (6) can be computed
after solving the integral,
Pr
[|hs,d|2 + (l − 1)|hr,d|2 < b] = ∫ b

where ν = λr,d/(l − 1).
In the following, we derive the probability that a transmis-
sion undergoes l rounds of direct transmission and that of
cooperative transmission, respectively.
A. Direct Transmission
We consider the worst case scenario of l rounds of direct
transmission, which may raise when one of the following three
events occurs: 1) no relays can decode the information from
source, i.e., empty decoding set; 2) no strong relays exist, i.e.,
empty strong decoding set; 3) more than one strong relays
attempt to help in the second round. Denote D(s) and D̂(s)
as the decoding set and strong decoding set, respectively. The
probability of a particular decoding set is given by [1], [15]
Pr[D(s)] =
∏
r∈D(s)
e−λs,rb ×
∏
r/∈D(s)
(1− e−λs,rb) (8)
The conditional probability of empty strong decoding set can
be obtained as
Pr[|D̂(s)| = 0|D(s)] =
∏
r∈D(s)

Combining (8) and (9) along with the fact that an empty
decoding set also leads to an empty strong decoding set, we
obtain
Pr[|D̂(s)| = 0] =

If more than one strong relays exist and they reach the same
decision to help at the same time, collisions due to multiple
transmissions from different relays occur at the destination.
We consider the worst case that once a collision occur in
the second round, the operation of cooperative relaying ter-
minates and the source will take over until the transmission
is successful or reaching the retry limit. Let p1 denote the
probability of exact one strong relay transmits, and p0 the
probability that none of strong relay transmits. Denote A as
the set of assisting relays, i.e., the strong relays that transmit,
the conditional probability of more than one relays attempting
to help, given the existence of strong relays is thus
Pr[|A| > 0] = 1− p0 − p1. (11)
The probability of p0 is simply
p0 =

To obtain Pr[D̂(s)], consider the fact that D̂(s) is a subset of
D(s). For a particular D̂(s), denote DU(s) the union of those
