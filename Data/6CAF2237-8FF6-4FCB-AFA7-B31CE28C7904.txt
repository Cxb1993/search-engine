英文摘要 
Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most complicated industries in the world. In order to reduce 
installation cost and increase production flexibility, twin-fab concept has been established over the past 
decade, which means two neighboring fabs can be connected to each other by automatic transportation system. 
Through the design of twin-fab, manufacturing performance, such as total throughput and cycle time of 
products, can be improved conspicuously. However, if lacking of completed production planning and control 
models, the benefit of twin-fab will be decreased significantly. In this proposal, a completed production 
planning and control system will be developed.  
The proposal will include job release policy, capacity backup model and performance estimation model 
sections. First year, a production supporting system will be established, which includes job release policy and 
capacity backup model. Production and transportation capacity of the twin-fab will be considered in job 
release policy to decide the product types, quantity and timing for job releasing. The function of capacity 
backup model is to relieve the load of the permanent and temporary bottlenecks. Due to permanent bottleneck 
is caused by capacity shortage, product mix and capacity analysis will be applied to the decision of backup 
quantity. The temporary bottlenecks occur by the uncertainties of factory, and result in increasing the cycle 
time. Hence, the backup quantity and timing for the temporary bottlenecks will be based on the analysis of 
machines’ stability and the mechanism of buffer management. A performance estimation model will be 
developed in the second year. Due to capacity backup, the performance of individual fab, such as cycle time 
and throughput will be changed. A simulation model will be established to observe the relationship between 
batch transfer and performance indices. Based on these results, we will modify the queuing network model 
and develop an accurate performance estimation model precisely. According to completed production 
planning and control model, the machines blocking and starving phenomena will be avoided and it will result 
in reducing the cycle time of products and increasing the total throughput of twin-fab.

上產生了變化。就12吋晶圓廠的晶圓搬運方式而言，由於12吋的晶盒體積與重量相較於以往的8吋增加
許多，為了避免人工搬運的不便所可能造成的人員傷害以及產品的安全性考量下。目前的12吋半導體
現場管控趨勢，大多採取自動化物料搬運系統(Automatic MaterialHandling System, AMHS)的方式來進
行搬運的動作。雖然以往8吋雙子星晶圓廠也是採取AMHS，只是當遇到傳輸系統派遣不及，或是生產
排程臨時改變等狀況時，現場作業人員為了避免機台挨餓等狀況的發生，大多會直接以人工搬運的方
式來進行處理，可惜的是此種處理方式對12吋雙子星晶圓廠的流程管控來說已經不太適用。所以對於
12吋雙子星晶圓廠來說，如何運用雙子星廠可以同時考慮兩廠生產規劃之優點，對於產能支援以及傳
輸系統產能的決策進行相互間的配合與考量，對於未來12吋雙子星晶圓廠的管理上勢必是一個必須面
對的課題。 
過去針對產能支援的問題，Tu et al.【25】提出利用保護性產能與機台產能負荷的概念，計算出合
理的產能支援數量，而對於執行產能支援後的績效估計則是利用等候理論與Little＇s Law的觀念，建構
出一套有效的估計模式。雖然其研究環境的考量因素，是針對兩獨立工廠之間的產能支援問題進行研
究，但對於產品backup的設定上，還只是針對單一產品進行研究。除此之外，對於傳輸系統方面仍未
加以考量，也造成對於即時性反應的問題無法探討。 
對於AMHS的研究，大部分的學者都針對單一工廠內的AHMS排程與指派方式進行探討；或者是
對於單一12吋晶圓廠中，interbay與intrabay系統的AMHS的運作法則，亦或是AMHS與工廠設施規劃之
間整合效力的研究【2】【3】【8】【12】【28】。在這些相關研究中，可以發現這些對於AMHS排程、
指派或是規劃模式的探討，其判定模式好壞的衡量指標，大多著重傳輸系統的反應時間是否最短、是
否能快速找到最短路徑，或者是傳輸時間能否準時(on-time delivery)等居多【9】【16】【18】，因為
有學者認為能達到on-time delivery以及較短的反應時間，對於Cycle time或是機台使用率等績效指標，
就會有較好的提升效果。但是這方面的研究中針對雙子星廠間之傳輸系統的文獻探討則較為缺乏，不
僅如此，雙子星廠間之傳輸系統在排程、指派或是規劃上的考量，也必須跟兩廠的產能規劃同時配合，
否則其傳輸後所帶來的效果，就無法有效的顯現出來，因此比起過去單一工廠傳輸系統的研究上，雙
子星廠在考量與研究上也會的較為麻煩且複雜。而關於結合產能支援與AMHS這兩方面的研究，過去
學者研究曾提出不少概念與方法，像是Tobaet al. 【19】【20】【21】提出利用real time inter-fab dispatching 
rules以及segment-based approach的概念，探討加工物件允許可跨廠生產的環境中，對每一個加工物件
進行製造流程上的指派，以期望達到較佳的績效表現。Wu and Chang【29】所探討的實驗環境，則是
針對擁有夥伴關係之半導體廠，其之間產能支援的管控方式，以及如何選擇出較佳的搬運方案進行研
究，其提出結合倒傳遞類神經演算法(BPN)與基因演算法(GA)的概念，找出較佳的傳送組合，來達到所
謂move數提升之目標，進而使的廠內Cycle Time與產出量之績效有顯著提升。雖然Toba et al.以及Wu 
and Chang先前的相關研究，對於產能支援與AMHS兩方面結合，提出不錯的解決概念與模式，但卻也
發現在這些學者的研究過程裡，對於傳輸系統的產能方面的限制卻都未加以考量，雖然理論架構與實
驗結果都有不錯的表現，但如依據理論模式去執行，極可能造成過多且頻繁的傳輸動作，就現場說過
多的傳輸動作可能增加晶圓破損的機率增加。除此之外，礙於廠內空間的限制下，傳輸系統的產能也
勢必有限，而其過多的傳輸要求與動作是否都能達到，這都是在實際現場中會碰到的問題，所以在考
慮傳輸系統產能有限的條件下，其產能支援與AMHS的互相結合的研究方面，仍有一些須要改善與考
量的地方。 
此外，在半導體產業中所關心的績效指標，不外乎是Cycle time與產出量(Throughput)，此兩項指
標不僅顯示與評判其生產績效的好壞，更是生產規劃階段很重要的兩大指標。生產規劃人員通常會以
預估的Cycle Time與Throughput來做為訂單交期允諾的因素，因此績效預估的準確與否在生產規劃上十
分重要。雖然在過去的研究中不少的學者，提出不少相關的估算式【4】【5】【10】【13】【27】，
 4
外的干擾，雙子星晶圓廠的績效預估將會較以往困難許多。因此，完整解決雙子星晶圓廠生產規劃問
題必須包含以下三個方向：投料決策(job release policy)、產能支援決策(capacity backup)以及績效預估
模式(performance evaluation model)，而以上各決策模式的詳細說明分述如下： 
1. 投料支援決策 
(A) 生產系統產能檢核 
由於雙子星廠可以藉由自動化搬運系統(AMHS)來進行即時性的產能支援，因此初步上是
將兩廠之機台產能合併起來進行生產系統產能的檢核與規劃，而本研究在此方面提出如下之參

DC 與 MCj不相等時則代表其產品投料比率，對於在雙子星廠環境裡就算透過產能支
援的方式仍無法滿足實際產能需求，如此在本階段的檢核結果上則必須將其產品投料比率加以
改變，以期符合所需之產能需求，以免接下來的規劃上出現錯誤。 
(B) 搬運系統產能檢核 
經由前部份的生產系統產能檢核後，接下來將對於 AMHS 的產能進行檢核與規劃。上個階
段的產能檢核是考量在雙子星廠實行跨廠的產能支援條件下，生產系統產能所能提供的最大產
能情況，如何去規劃一個合適的 AMHS 車輛數，對於一個高度自動化的雙子星廠產線來說十分
重要，過多或太少都會影響到 AMHS 的實際能提供的產能，因此接下來就針對 AMHS 產能的
部份進行檢核。 
AMHS 主要是在幫助生產流程更為流暢的一種手段，對於產品價值提升上並無直接的效
益，因此對於 AMHS 的產能需求上，首先本研究先從機台運作的角度切入思考，但由於半導體
現場機台種類繁多，因此本研究提出一套 adjust X-factor contribution 概念來做為選定關鍵機台的
方式，而其細部過程與研究結果如附件一之文章所示，而本篇文章已被國際期刊 International 
Journal of Services Operations and Informatics (EI) 所收錄並於 2009 刊登。 
而由於本研究是以提升生產系統績效為前提下進行相關之決策制定，因此關於 AMHS 的車
輛數的規劃上，將從為了避免機台在加工作過程中，因為 AMHS 來不及送達工件而發生機台挨
餓的情況進行思考，因此本計劃對於 AMHS 車輛數的考量上，運用 adjust X-factor contribution、
保護性產能以及等候理論之相關概念，發展出一套 AMHS 車輛數的估算模式，其詳細的研究結

先前的一些相關研究發現，機台當機干擾因子對系統的影響是不可忽視的，因此在績效估算模式的
建構方面，也結合吾人過去所提出之相關機台當機修正式【22】。此外在加上由於雙子星晶圓廠的
產能支援環境大致上可分為，無產能缺口與有產能缺口兩種，其發生須要進行產能支援的情況也不
同，因此關於績效預估方面的模式建構概念與方式也有所差異。在無產能缺口情況下，發生需要進
行產能支援大多是現場出現無法預期之嚴重產能損失狀況，為了避免 WIP 迅速累積影響生產系統
的整體績效所施行之手段，因此本研究將從機台產能合併角度下進行模式之建構，以虛擬合併機台
的觀點估算得到，關於運用產能支援之決策管控下其績效的改善。至於在有產能缺口方面，由於此
種情況的發生產能支援是可以預期的且也是必需的，因此關於這方面的績效預估模式，將藉由從過
去吾人相關之研究【26】進行更進一步的修正，以符合雙子星晶圓廠之實際情況，關於這方面的詳

1 Introduction 
Semiconductor manufacturing is a capital, labour and technology intensive high-tech 
industry with complex processes. In order to maintain profitability, firms have to 
improve productivity, quality, cycle time and on-time delivery continuously. Many 
researchers believed that reducing variability of system can keep the low cycle time as 
the system approaching its maximum throughput rate. Many theories and methodologies 
were presented on performance improvement to reduce system variability from reducing 
mean cycle time and cycle time variance (Adams et al., 1988; Goldratt and Cox, 1996; 
Lee et al., 2002). For example, Theory of Constraint emphasises the importance of 
bottleneck and puts all efforts on the bottleneck of system (Goldratt and Cox, 1996). The 
theory of just-in-time is also used for management system of production efficiency.  
It was addressed to lower WIP in overall system, because the higher WIP resulted in  
bad production performance. Although many theories were presented for production 
managements (Enns, 1995; Srivatsan and Kempf, 1995; Sattler, 1996; Chung and  
Huang, 1999), they were hard to apply to the wafer fabrication due to some specific 
characteristics such as re-entry, complicate process flow and high utilisation rate of 
machines. Therefore, an useful and simple index was developed, which can measure and 
represent the performance of overall system in wafer fabrication. This index is called  
X-factor. 
The basic X-factor was proposed by Martin (1996). It was defined as the total mean 
cycle time of system divided by the total Raw Process Time (RPT) of the production line. 
Besides, it showed the relationship between normalised cycle time and RPT in overall 
system. Therefore, in steady state, the concept of X-factor can be used to estimate  
the cycle time of each product when the product mix of wafer fabrication is stable. 
Unfortunately, product mix is changed frequently and enormously in wafer foundry.  
Afterward the extended application of X-factor was proposed by many researchers 
(Martin, 1996; Martin, 1997, Martin, 1998, Kishimoto et al., 2001). Martin’s study  
used the extended X-factor exclusively as an alternative measure for identifying and 
monitoring machine group level characteristics. Moreover, Delp et al. (2005, 2006) also 
proposed a modificatory model of X-factor, which combined Kingman’s equation with 
Martin’s concept. In these studies, they both indicated that the X-factor can be used to

Figure 1 The diagram of batching behaviour (see online version for colour) 
 
Based on GI/G/m queuing theory, there are five principal parameters within GI/G/m 
queuing model (Lazowska et al., 1984; Fowler et al., 2002): average arrival rate (λ), 
average service time (τ), squared coefficient of variation of arrival rate ( 2aC ), squared 
coefficient of variation of service time ( 2sC ) and number of servers (m). The 
modification of these five parameters can be captured by Tu and Liou (2006). However, 
this paper proposed a general model, which can apply to single lot or batch workstations. 
Therefore, the parameters of 2aC  are modified as follows:

Whereas Wq(Q) is the expected waiting time of any product by batch type to wait for 
processing. From Figure 1, Wq(Q) was calculated by GI/G/m queuing model which was 
used with above modification of parameters. The approximation formula of GI/G/m 
model was referred to the revision queuing model which was modified from EW(M/M/m) 
by Whitt (1993).

The expected waiting time Wq(Q) was referred to the revision queuing model by (Tu and 
Liou, 2006, Tu and Chen, 2008). Fowler et al. (2002) shows that, in terms of batching 
behaviour, when the first lot arrives to the queue, it has to wait for the arrival of 
additional (b-1) lots. In the same situation, the second lot has to wait for the arrival of 
other (b-2) lots and so on. The last lot has not waited for any other lot. Thus, the expected 
waiting time of product to form a batch Wq(Q) can be defined as follows.

2.2 Cycle time estimation of un-batching process 
The un-batch workstation always connects with the batch workstation. Because the  
un-batching process has different arrival pattern (Tu and Chen, 2006; Tu, 2008), a special 
model is proposed to fit its character. In this model, two series of queues are presented 
for the queuing system in front of un-batch machines. The first one stands for the queue 
to wait for un-batching; the second is a queue to wait for processing. The parameters and 
performance measures are diagrammed in Figure 2. 
From Figure 2, W(Q) is the expected waiting time of any product by batch type to 
wait for un-batching. W(U) is the expected waiting time of any product to wait for 
processing. Summation of W(Q) and W(U) can derive the total expected waiting time in 
GI/G/1 queuing system denoted by EW(Q). The modification models of W(Q) and W(U)

4 System performance improvement 
The previous studies (Delp et al., 2005; Delp et al., 2006) indicated that the Complete  
X-Factor Contribution (CXC) measure can identify the capacity constraining machine 
groups effectively and accurately for semiconductor manufacturing. They demonstrated 
the effectiveness of this measure, as compared with a typical utilisation measure. 
Nevertheless, CXC did not consider batching and un-batching processes, which are  
the common processes and cannot be ignored in wafer fabrication. Therefore, AXFC 
measure is developed, which includes batching and un-batching issue, to verify whether 
the conclusions of previous researches (Delp et al., 2005, Delp et al., 2006) are still 
workable or not. The eM-Plant simulation model was established to collect data. The 
structure of simulation model is shown in Figure 3. 
4.1 Indicators and methodologies of system performance improvement 
There are two different environments, UX and XU, designed in this experiment. UX 
means the position of the high utilisation machine group is in front of the high AXFC 
machine group in production line and vice versa. Under these two environments, two 
different indicators, utilisation and AXFC and two improving approaches were used to 
compare the performance of system improvement. The improving approaches included: 
(1) reducing the variability of machine group by increasing machine breakdown 
frequencies (2) additional capacity through increasing machines. Based on the different 
environments, indicators and approaches, the effects of mean cycle time and cycle time 
variability on the overall system are surveyed by the simulation model.

Therefore, if the shorter cycle time and lower variations of cycle time are wanted, the 
location of high utilisation machine group should be in front of high AXFC machine 
group in capacity planning stage. 
4.3 The effects of variability reduction under UX and XU environments 
4.3.1 UX environment 
Figure 5 presents the improvement results of mean cycle time and cycle time deviation 
by decreasing the variability of machine group under UX environment. In this stage, the 
improved effects of cycle time and cycle time deviation were validated by different 
improving indicators. The assumptions are as follows: 
H0: The reducing of mean cycle time (or cycle time deviation) is not significant by 
increasing machine breakdown frequency. 
H1: The reducing of mean cycle time (or cycle time deviation) is significant by increasing 
machine breakdown frequency. 
Figure 5 The result of variability reduction for machine of high AXFC, high utilisation and 
second high AXFC under UX environment (see online version for colour) 
 
From Table 6, all p-value are great than 0.05, hence H0 is accepted under 95% confidence 
level. It can be made the conclusion that there is no significant reduction on cycle  
time and cycle time deviation either on different system loading conditions or different 
selection of improved machine groups by reduction the frequency of machine 
breakdown.

chose under system full load. It means that the supplemental capacity can not significant 
reduce cycle time and cycle time deviation significantly except the supplemental capacity 
is added on high utilisation machine group under system full load.

5 Conclusion 
X-factor is an important index of performance, which is accepted extensively in 
production management of wafer fabrication. However, there is no any X-factor model 
can describe all types of processes especially for batching and un-batching processes. In 
this work, a general X-factor determination model, AXFC, for all types of machines in 
wafer fabrication is developed. GI/G/m queuing theory is applied into this model for  
the aggregated cycle time estimation. The machine downtime variability, lot arrival 
variability, batching processing and un-batching processing are taken into account. 
Furthermore, a simulation model is established to validate the feasibility of model. By 
this model, X-factor of each work centre can be easily and accurately calculated. 
In addition, a different view of cycle time improvement is explored in this work as 
well. Generally, system bottleneck is regarded as an improvement target and it is indeed 
can improve product cycle time by adding supplemental capacity or reducing machine 
variability. However, this approach is expensive mostly. In this work, some findings 
were explored through simulation experiment. In order to shorten cycle time and lower 
variations of cycle time, the location of high utilisation machine group should be in front 
of high AXFC machine group in capacity planning stage. Furthermore, reducing machine 
variability to the high AXFC machine groups will reduce product cycle time and cycle 
time variability in XU environment significantly. Providing more capacity to bottleneck 
machine will reduce product cycle time and cycle time variability significantly.

MODEL TO DETERMINE AMHS CAPACITY FOR 
WAFER FABRICATION

Chung Hua University, Taiwan 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Automatic Material Handling System (AMHS) is getting more important in 300mm wafer fabrication factory 
(Fab). An effective and efficient design and control of AMHS became more critical in 300mm fab. Capacity 
planning is one of the major factors of AMHS design. Generally, surplus capacity can not increase throughput 
but reduce ROI (Return On Investment). On the other hand, if the AMHS capacity is insufficient, the throughput 
will be impacted seriously. Therefore, how to determine an adequate capacity level is a key point for 300mm fab.  
The major concept of AMHS capacity determination model is to maintain the original designed production 
performance. In order to maintain fab‘s performance, the WIP portfolio of constraint machines should be kept. 
Based on this concept, a GI/G/m queuing model is applied to represent the AMHS and to determine the required 
numbers of vehicles. It assumed that products should be transported to next processing equipment by finishing 
the processing part of next equipment, thus the WIP in front of this constraint machine can be kept the same. 
Under this condition, the probability that transportation time exceeds part processing time under a certain 
transportation capacity level can be calculated by proposed model. Hence, we can get the required capacity of 
AMHS which can achieve the probability target set in advance. 
Due to the capacity of AMHS will be set according to the acceptable probability of non-exceeding 
processing time of constraint machines, the level of WIP in front of constraint machines can be kept. It also can 
be ensured that AMHS will not affect the production performance as well as keep on a reasonable investment 
level. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Semiconductor manufacturing is a capital, labor and technology intensive high-tech industry with complex 
processes, consisting of thousands of process steps, re-entrant flows and batch processing. The technology and 
efficiency of manufacturing have to be improved continuously to increase profitability (Tu and Liou, 2006; 
Driessel and Mönch, 2007; Tu, 2008). Generally, 300 mm manufacturing is a common and necessary technique 
in recent wafer fabrication. In order to achieve high cost-effective production and avoid the possible injury of 
employees due to carrying the heavy weight of 300 mm wafers, a highly automated material transfer system 
should be established in 300 mm semiconductor fabs (Liao and Fu, 2004). Accordingly, Automatic Material 
Handling System (AMHS) plays an important and significant role for 300 mm wafer fabrication fab. The AMHS 
acts as a connector among workstations to assist to deliver the products to the right place, at the right time. 
Hence, an effective and efficient design and control of AMHS became more critical factor in 300 mm fab. 
Capacity planning is one of the major factors of AMHS design. Generally, surplus capacity can not increase 
throughput but reduce ROI. On the other hand, if the AMHS capacity is insufficient, the throughput will be 
impacted seriously. Therefore, how to determine an adequate capacity level is a key point for 300mm fab. 
Abundant researches with methods to design the quantity of AMHS. The primary method is based on 
minimizing some functions of acquisition costs (Egbelu, 1993; Herrmann, et al., 1999; Kuo, 2002; Steele, 2002; 
Liao and Fu, 2004). However, the acquirement of cost data is difficult and some performance data is hard to 
transfer to cost index. Furthermore, from the literature, it shows that simulation and queuing theory are usually 
applied in the determination of AMHS capacity (Bozer and Park, 2001; Benjaafar, 2002; Nazzal and Bodner, 
2003; Raman, et al., 2008). Simulation approach is just an evaluation model. It can only provide the result under

Step 2 Compute the minimum permissible arrival time of product 
 
In our research experiment, the products have to move to the next workstations by MHS. The workstation 
will be idle, if products can not arrive in the right time by MHS. Besides, we assume there is a good WIP 
management rule to define the WIP level in front of constraint machines. Consequently, we will set a threshold 
value for the cycle time of MHS transportation that can keep the same WIP level and avoid constraint machines 
in an idle situation. The value was obtained from the following equation:

In this step, the mean service time (E(St)) and service time variation (Var(St)) of material handing system 
are calculated. Form pervious research, there are two kinds of traveling time in the transportation service. One is 
the material-handling device travels empty from the workstation location of its last delivery to the workstation 
location of the current request. The other is material-handling device travels full to the workstation location of 
goal. The detailed process can refer to Benjaafar (2002). The equations of parameters are represented as follows.

Step 8 Determine the required capacity for MHS 
 
In this step manager should set a target probability which MHS can deliver the WIP to the constraint 
machins in the right time. Due to the probability function is complicated, the determination of MHS quantity can 
only use the trial and error. The minimum of MHS quantity which can meet the target probability will be the best 
quantity of MHS. 
 
NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 
 
In this section, a numerical illustration is presented to demonstrate the procedures of our proposed 
approach. There were five workstations associated with three product families with reentry production flows in 
this example. The products include 24 and 34 process steps and the demands of products per month were 900 
and 300 lots respectively. The arrival rate of system is equal to demand rate and set up with an exponential 
distribution arrival. The other assumption and experimental parameters of example are shown as follow: 
1. Each workstation has two infinite buffer which are loading and unloading ports. 
2. Each vehicle moves one load at one time operating under the dispatching rule of first-come-first-served 
(FCFS). 
3. Vehicle‘s travel times is given by tij = dij/v; where dij is the distance between any two workstation i and j 
and ―v‖ is the MHS‘s speed. 
4. The system in this example is indexed from Wi= 0 to 7, where i = 0 and 7 denotes the release and shipping 
workstations, respectively. 
5. Load/unload of the vehicle is determination.

Step 6 Calculate the mean waiting time of product waiting for the service of MHS 
 In this step, we will use Gi/G/m queuing theory to calculate the mean waiting time of product waiting 
for the service of MHS. The other modification of parameters can refer step1-4. The result is shown as fallow:

Step 8 Determine the required capacity for MHS 
Assume the target probability set by manager is 1. The number of HMS and the probability that waiting 
time of WIP for HMS within 0.203 hour are as Table 5. Based on the result of Table 5, the best quantity of 
vehicles is 31 sets.

CONCLUSION 
 
In this work, a capacity determination model for AMHS based on GI/G/m queuing model was proposed. 
The major concept of this model is linking the AMHS capacity determination to production performance. 
Therefore, the best quantity of vehicles would be determined through this model. Under this configuration, the 
production system can be performed well with lower investment of MHS. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of 
manufacturing systems and the relationship between the processing facilities and MHS are properly and 
realistically described. 
Regarding to the future work, the failure behavior of HMS can be considered. HMS can be treated as a 
workstation. In this point of view, failure behavior will increase the required capacity of HMS and should be 
taken into account. In addition, the congestion of HMS is another important issue in the capacity determination 
and can be considered in the future work.

 Abstract: The twin-fab concept has been established 
over the past decade due to the considerations of cheaper 
facility build up, faster equipment move in and more flexible 
productivity management. However, if lacking of completed 
backup control policies, the benefit of twin-fab will be 
decreased significantly particularly in production flexibility 
as well as effectiveness. 
In this work, the control policy of capacity backup was 
established that two control thresholds were developed. The 
first one is the WIP (Working In Process) amount threshold 
which is the trigger for backup action. Nonetheless, the 
concept of protective capacity is also applied to set this 
threshold. When the WIP level in front of the workstation 
which needs capacity support is over the threshold, the 
action of capacity support is triggered. In order to endorse 
the effectiveness of WIP transfer between twin-fab, the 
threshold of WIP amount difference (D) is set as a control 
gate. When the WIP level in front of the workstation which 
needs capacity support is over the threshold and the 
difference of WIP amount in the twin fabs is over than D, 
the coming WIP will be transferred to the other fab. The 
design of the threshold of WIP amount difference is based 
on the concept of the coverage of transportation time and 
the benefit should be got when backup action is occurred. 
Through these two control rules, WIP can be well arranged 
among the twin fabs and be processed more efficiently and 
effectively. Finally, the production performances of twin 
fabs will be improved under the capacity backup policy.

I. Introduction 
 
Compare with other industries, wafer fabrication is 
more complicated and scientific, particularly in 
manufacturing processes, such as re-entrant flows, time 
constraints between operations, and batch processing [1]], 
[2]. In order to keep high competitiveness, the capacity 
expansion and manufacturing of advanced technology are 
necessary. The managers, however, have to suffer many 
difficulties in such a circumstance, for instance, the market 
demand is changed rapidly, equipment cost is increased and 
the technology is upgraded frequently. Hence, if the 
managers try to expand capacity under such dynamic 
environment, it will be at high risk [3].  
Over the past decades, many semiconductor 
manufacturing companies tend to accept twin-fab concept. 
The notion of twin-fab means two neighboring fabs are not 
only installed in the same building, but also connect to each 
other through AMHS (Automatic Material Handling 
System). There are some advantages of twin-fab as follows. 
1. To reduce the cost of capacity expansion through 
sharing the essential facilities, such as gas pumps 
system and recycling system of polluted water.  
2. Due to the building and basic facilities established 
in the beginning stage, the construction time of 
the second fab will be shortened. 
3. As the twin-fab is two neighboring fabs, the real-
time capacity backup can be achieved to each 
other by AMHS. 
Because of these features, the adaptability of 
production line of twin-fab is more flexible than single fab. 
However, there are few of researches focus on capacity 
support between twin-fab from the viewpoint of the whole 
performance of the production system, such as cycle time of 
products and throughput. In previous studies, linear 
programming (LP) is used to solve the capacity allocation 
problem in general environment, which assumed each 
product should be manufactured completely within single-
fab [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, the LP model is hard to apply 
to twin-fab configuration. Because of the computational 
scale becomes more complex and enormous, artificial neural 
network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) are combined 
with LP model by other researchers [8], [9]. These models 
were used to solve the route planning of capacity backup

is insufficient. Hence, WIP amount can be a trigger factor to 
decide the backup action should be launched or not. Based 
on this concept, a threshold of WIP amount which launches 
the backup program should be setup. In order to setup the 
threshold of WIP amount, the essentiality of WIP should be 
examined. The positive side of WIP provides for resources 
to be put to full economical use and prevents unpredictable 
events from disturbing maximum output rate. This 
maximum output rate is particularly prevalent in capital 
intensive factories such as a semiconductor fab. The 
negative aspects of WIP are an increase in cycle time, 
impaired delivery performance and quality degradation [13], 
[14], [15], [16]. From this viewpoint, WIP level should be 
set as the amount used to protect against statistical 
fluctuation (breakdowns, late receipts of material, quality 
problems, and others) from the feeder machines. Generally, 
machine breakdowns are the major statistical fluctuation in 
fab and it is taken as the only one factor in this work. 
Based on the above concept, WIP threshold can be set as the 
level to protect the breakdowns of feeder machines. 
Therefore, WIP threshold is defined as equation (1) in a 
balanced line

Usually, the machines need to request for backup are 
defined as a constraint machine. It means the capacity of 
feeder machines is more than the constraint machine. The 
lost capacity of feeder machines will not fully affect on the 
constraint machine. Therefore, WIP in front of constraint 
machine should be the loss from the breakdowns subtracting 
the surplus capacity of feeder machines. Under this 
circumstance, WIP threshold can be modified as equation

Besides, MTTR is the mean value of machine's 
downtime; that is to say, around 50% of the machines will 
fail to surpass this mean value. In order to determine the 
WIP threshold, a confidence level must be incorporated to 
ensure that the constraint machine is fully protected. The 
following equation is the modified WIP threshold by 
confidence level α.

C.   THRESHOLD OF WIP AMOUNT 
DIFFERENCE  
Although WIP threshold is the signal of backup launch, 
it doesn’t mean that the backup action is always effective. If 
the WIP in front of the supporting machines is more than 
those of the supported machines, WIP transferring is useless 
and ineffective for production performances. Hence, a gate 
to verify the effectiveness under capacity support is 
necessary.   
There are three factors included in the development of 
the threshold of WIP amount difference, WIP transportation 
time between twin fabs, machine breakdowns and expected 
performance increasing. Generally, WIP transfers to the 
other fab for backup should be transferred back when 
backup process finished. If the queue time reducing can not 
cover the transportation time, the action of backup is 
ineffective. Besides, there is the possibility that machines 
breakdown for a long time. Under this situation, the queue 
time of WIP will be worse than it just waits in the original 
fab. Therefore, the factor of machine breakdowns should be 
taken into account in the setting of WIP difference threshold. 
Finally, the factor of performance increasing should be 
included, otherwise, the backup action will be got nothing. 
Usually, one run of time save will be taken by managers. It 
means the queue time of WIP transferring should be saved 
one of processing time at least. In this work, the processing 
time is set as a unit, and how many times of processing time 
will be a variable decided by managers. Based on the above 
concepts, the threshold of WIP amount difference (D) is 
expressed by the following equations.

Abstract: This study proposed an effective model for performance estimation of twin fabs under a real time 
capacity backup environment. The notion of twin-fab means two neighboring fabs are not only installed in 
the same building, but also connect to each other through AMHS (Automatic Material Handling System). In 
order to increase the whole performance, the capacity backup should be performed between twin fabs.  
In this study, the performance estimation model is established under two situations, temporary and perma-
nent capacity shortage. The queuing theory and Little’s Law is applied in both two situations to develop the 
estimation model. Besides, in temporary capacity shortage, the performance estimation is based on the con-
cept of capacity mergence of capacity backup workstation. In the other words, the twin fabs are taken as a 
single fab for the capacity backup machines to estimate the performance. Based on this model, managers can 
obtain an appropriate estimation of capacity backup performance in twin-fab environment, which will help to 
get a reliable information for decision making.

【摘要】本研究主要是針對雙子星晶圓廠環境提出一套生產績效預估模式。由於雙子星晶圓廠位於同一
地理位置且產能配置通常具有差異，為了提高整體之績效表現，廠區之間必須透過產能互相支援解決暫
時性產能缺口或機台負荷不平衡等問題。因此，本研究分為無產能缺口與有產能缺口兩種狀態來構建其
績效預估模式，並且透過等候理論與Little’s Law兩者理論的結合來預估雙子星晶圓廠在產能互相支援下
生產週期時間與產出的改變。除此之外，在無產能缺口情況下，並從合併加工機台站之產能的觀點來進
行其產能支援下之績效估算。期望藉由此模式的建立使管理者在兩廠產能相互支援下能夠擁有一套準確
的績效估算系統，以獲得充足且可以信賴之資訊做為決策之依據。

1 前言 
晶圓製造產業相較於大多數的製造產業而言，其製
造過程所需之步驟極為複雜，例如高度重複的回流特
性、工件等候時間之限制以及特殊的批量加工製程
[1][2]。為了保持高競爭力，擴大生產能力和先進的生產
技術對於此產業是必要的。然而在面臨投資產能擴展與
新製程引進的抉擇上，管理者除了要考量投資計畫所帶
給公司的利益大小外，也必須要顧慮瞬息萬變的市場環
境可能帶來的投資風險[3]，所以半導體製造業為了因應
這樣的產業生態以及降低投資上的風險，近幾十年來許
多公司紛紛逐漸採用雙子星工廠概念來建廠，這樣的特
性解決半導體製造公司期望快速且更有彈性的因應市
場需求變動的訴求。除此之外，相較於單一晶圓廠的管
控模式，其雙子星廠架構在管控上也增添了不少的優勢
[4]。面對一個相當動態且詭譎多變的市場，各式各樣的
顧客要求隨時都可能發生。而在半導體產業的建廠計劃
過程中，對於未來要生產的產品組合大多有一定的預估
與規劃，也使的其所需採購的機台種類與數量也都被規
範在一定的程度內。然而，即使有再好的規劃與預估，
在任何一個穩定的生產系統裡，仍有會造成短期的產能
不足的情形發生。而導致這樣的情況不外乎兩種情況，
第一種為當廠內機台發生嚴重當機，此種非預期的因素
所導致的短期產能損失；第二則是由於顧客的要求而導

所謂的無產能缺口指的是兩廠可互相進行產能支
援之機台，在本身投料節奏不變之情況下，其原先之機
台產能是足夠的，可是一但在無預警情況下機台發生相
當嚴重之當機，此時勢必導致機台前短期間內累積過多
的在製品(WIP)，而管理者為了避免此情況造成產線績
效傷害擴大，因此才產生需要尋求產能支援的需求。 
由於此類因素是無法預先得知發生與否，因此本研
究將從合併機台產能的角度來切入(如圖1所示)，原本的
各廠之到達率為實線的部分，合併來看後其虛擬合併機
台的到達率則為虛線線段之部分，除此之外並考量先前
學者所提出之其他影響因子在製品門檻值(THV)以及機
台當機，最後結合等候理論中Cycle time之估算與相關
機率概念，推導出在無能缺口環境下之績效估算模式。 
首先藉由公式(1)的計算，我們可以計算出虛擬合
併機台之到達率，然後參考Tu & Chen[12]將當機時間修
正加入工件加工時間的模式，修正出虛擬合併機台的加
工時間、加工時間變異係數平方以及到達率變異係數平
方，如公式(2)-(4)。接著利用Tu & Hung[9]所提出之計算
式求得各自產線之THV，以及利用等候理論計算出各產
線之平均等候線長度QL，然後再使用公式(5)分別將此
兩項參數單位，由個數轉換成為時間單位(TTHV與
TQL)，以便於後續之計算使用。由於在無產能缺口的環
境中會產生產能支援搬運的機率發生在當TQL>TTHV
時，因此透過等候理論之相關機率公式計算可得知其發
生之機率，然後利用期望值的概念計算出平均搬運時
間，接著再利用等候理論Gi/G/M估算出虛擬合併機台之
Cycle time，最後結合兩者而推導出公式(6)，其所計算
之數值即是在無產能缺口情況下，實行產能支援機台之
機台cycle time。

I. Introduction 
 
Compare with other industries, wafer fabrication is 
more complicated and scientific, particularly in 
manufacturing processes, such as re-entrant flows, time 
constraints between operations, and batch processing [1]], 
[2]. In order to keep high competitiveness, the capacity 
expansion and manufacturing of advanced technology are 
necessary. The managers, however, have to suffer many 
difficulties in such a circumstance, for instance, the market 
demand is changed rapidly, equipment cost is increased and 
the technology is upgraded frequently. Hence, if the 
managers try to expand capacity under such dynamic 
environment, it will be at high risk [3].  
Over the past decades, many semiconductor 
manufacturing companies tend to accept twin-fab concept. 
The notion of twin-fab means two neighboring fabs are not 
only installed in the same building, but also connect to each 
other through AMHS (Automatic Material Handling 
System). There are some advantages of twin-fab as follows. 
1. To reduce the cost of capacity expansion through 
sharing the essential facilities, such as gas pumps 
system and recycling system of polluted water.  
2. Due to the building and basic facilities established 
in the beginning stage, the construction time of 
the second fab will be shortened. 
3. As the twin-fab is two neighboring fabs, the real-
time capacity backup can be achieved to each 
other by AMHS. 
Because of these features, the adaptability of 
production line of twin-fab is more flexible than single fab. 
However, there are few of researches focus on capacity 
support between twin-fab from the viewpoint of the whole 
performance of the production system, such as cycle time of 
products and throughput. In previous studies, linear 
programming (LP) is used to solve the capacity allocation 
problem in general environment, which assumed each 
product should be manufactured completely within single-
fab [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, the LP model is hard to apply 
to twin-fab configuration. Because of the computational 
scale becomes more complex and enormous, artificial neural 
network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) are combined 
with LP model by other researchers [8], [9]. These models 
were used to solve the route planning of capacity backup

is insufficient. Hence, WIP amount can be a trigger factor to 
decide the backup action should be launched or not. Based 
on this concept, a threshold of WIP amount which launches 
the backup program should be setup. In order to setup the 
threshold of WIP amount, the essentiality of WIP should be 
examined. The positive side of WIP provides for resources 
to be put to full economical use and prevents unpredictable 
events from disturbing maximum output rate. This 
maximum output rate is particularly prevalent in capital 
intensive factories such as a semiconductor fab. The 
negative aspects of WIP are an increase in cycle time, 
impaired delivery performance and quality degradation [13], 
[14], [15], [16]. From this viewpoint, WIP level should be 
set as the amount used to protect against statistical 
fluctuation (breakdowns, late receipts of material, quality 
problems, and others) from the feeder machines. Generally, 
machine breakdowns are the major statistical fluctuation in 
fab and it is taken as the only one factor in this work. 
Based on the above concept, WIP threshold can be set as the 
level to protect the breakdowns of feeder machines. 
Therefore, WIP threshold is defined as equation (1) in a 
balanced line

Usually, the machines need to request for backup are 
defined as a constraint machine. It means the capacity of 
feeder machines is more than the constraint machine. The 
lost capacity of feeder machines will not fully affect on the 
constraint machine. Therefore, WIP in front of constraint 
machine should be the loss from the breakdowns subtracting 
the surplus capacity of feeder machines. Under this 
circumstance, WIP threshold can be modified as equation 
(5).      - XECLMaxECL qq 0,'   (5)

Besides, MTTR is the mean value of machine's 
downtime; that is to say, around 50% of the machines will 
fail to surpass this mean value. In order to determine the 
WIP threshold, a confidence level must be incorporated to 
ensure that the constraint machine is fully protected. The 
following equation is the modified WIP threshold by 
confidence level α.

C.   THRESHOLD OF WIP AMOUNT 
DIFFERENCE  
Although WIP threshold is the signal of backup launch, 
it doesn’t mean that the backup action is always effective. If 
the WIP in front of the supporting machines is more than 
those of the supported machines, WIP transferring is useless 
and ineffective for production performances. Hence, a gate 
to verify the effectiveness under capacity support is 
necessary.   
There are three factors included in the development of 
the threshold of WIP amount difference, WIP transportation 
time between twin fabs, machine breakdowns and expected 
performance increasing. Generally, WIP transfers to the 
other fab for backup should be transferred back when 
backup process finished. If the queue time reducing can not 
cover the transportation time, the action of backup is 
ineffective. Besides, there is the possibility that machines 
breakdown for a long time. Under this situation, the queue 
time of WIP will be worse than it just waits in the original 
fab. Therefore, the factor of machine breakdowns should be 
taken into account in the setting of WIP difference threshold. 
Finally, the factor of performance increasing should be 
included, otherwise, the backup action will be got nothing. 
Usually, one run of time save will be taken by managers. It 
means the queue time of WIP transferring should be saved 
one of processing time at least. In this work, the processing 
time is set as a unit, and how many times of processing time 
will be a variable decided by managers. Based on the above 
concepts, the threshold of WIP amount difference (D) is 
expressed by the following equations.
