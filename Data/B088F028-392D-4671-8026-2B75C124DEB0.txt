Fig. 2  Cost for a circuit that is partitioned into 4 stages. 
The communication signals between stages must be buffered. The number of buffers required at the end 
of a stage is the communication cost of that stage. Fig. 2 shows the communication cost incurred by 
temporally partitioning a circuit into four stages. Since the communication cost represents storage overhead, 
several methods have been proposed for the NP-hard temporal partitioning problem to minimize the 
communication cost [5]–[8]. 
A partitioning algorithm must meet today’s urgent performance requirements. Consider the execution 
cost of stage 3 in the circuit shown in Fig. 2. Four paths pass through stage 3. The path from v6 to v7 is the 
critical one to determine the execution time. The execution cost of stage 3 is two. A partition with minimum 
communication cost may not ensure the optimal execution cost. Consider relocating v6 from stage 3 to stage 2. 
Although all communication costs remain the same, the execution cost becomes less. For a DRFPGA with 
fixed reconfiguration time, the performance is dominated by the execution time at each stage. Thus, reducing 
the execution time at each stage should be taken into consideration in partitioning. 
四、 研究方法 
I. Problem Statement 
A given circuit can be represented by a directed graph G = (V, E), where V and E are the set of vertices 
and the set of edges, respectively. There are two categories of vertex in V. A combinational vertex, denoted as 
C-vertex, represents a combinational gate in the circuit. A flip-flop vertex, denoted as FF-vertex, represents a 
flip-flop. Each vertex vV is associated with a weight w(v) which represents its area. For a directed edge e = 
(vx, vy) where vxV and vyV, the output signal of vx is fed to vy. Then, vx is said to be a fan-in vertex of vy and 
vy is said to be a fan-out vertex of vx. Since the output signal of a vertex can be fed to multiple vertices, more 
than one edge can be associated with a signal. A net is defined to be the set of edges associated with an output 
signal. An out-going edge from a C-vertex is said to be a C-type edge. Let vf be an FF-vertex. An out-going 
edge from vf is said to be an FF-type edge and the net associated with the output signal of vf is said to be an 
FF-type net. 
Let s(v) denote the stage that vertex v is assigned to. Let u ≼ v denote that s(v) must not be earlier than 
s(u). According to the rules given by Trimberger [5], the following temporal constraints are defined for an 
edge e = (vx, vy). 1) If vx is a C-vertex, then vx ≼ vy. 2) If vx is an FF-vertex, then vy ≼ vx. 
Let nx be a net and Vy be the set of the head vertices of the edges in nx. Let smax(nx) be the latest stage that 
includes at least one Vy vertex. If vx is a C-vertex, the output signal of vx must be used in the present user cycle 
so it is buffered from s(vx) to smax(Vy). If vx is an FF-vertex, the output signal of vx will be used in the next user 
cycle after it is generated. Thus it is buffered not only from s(vx) to the final stage of the current user cycle but 
also from the first stage to smax(Vy) in the next user cycle. Fig. 3 shows examples of these cases. 
 5
Vsi be the set of vertices in ⋃ sjj≤i . The communication cost at the end of stage si, denoted as c(si), is 
NetCut(Vsi, Vsiതതതത). According to the construction rules, it is concluded that the precedence graph Gp constructed 
from a diagraph G representing a circuit system is acyclic. 
III. Performance-Driven Partitioning Algorithm Considering Communication Cost 
A K-stage temporal partitioning for DRFPGA can be achieved by a sequence of bi-partitionings. The 
bi-partitioning algorithm proposed for this problem has three phases: 1) clustering, 2) partitioning and 3) 
iterative improvement. The input of this algorithm is the precedence graph. 
Our objective is the optimal performance of a DRFPGA implementing a given circuit. When a graph is 
temporally partitioned into two disjoint partite-sets P1 and P2, the stages for P1 must be executed before the 
stages for P2. Assume that the delays through each vertex in Gp are uniform. This is reasonable for LUT-based 
DRFPGA since the delay through each LUT is almost the same. A directed path in Gp that passes through only 
real edges is called a real path. The longest real path from s to t is called the critical real path. Let l be the 
length of the critical real path in Gp. If the lengths of the longest path in P1 and P2 are l/2, then the 
performance is optimal. Let ߩூ(v) denote the length of the longest path from the virtual vertex s to vertex v in 
Gp and ߩை(v) denote the length of the longest path from vertex v to the virtual vertex t in Gp. If a vertex v has 
ߩூ(v) > l/2, then assign v to P2. If a vertex v has ߩை(v) > l/2, then assign v to P1. This ensures that the upper 
bound of the execution costs of the two subsystems P1 and P2 is minimum and the performance of the 
DRFPGA circuit is optimal. If a vertex is not on the critical real path and both ߩூ(v) and ߩை(v) are less than 
l/2, it can be placed in either P1 or P2. Therefore, we assign the vertices on critical path first and use l/2 as the 
initial upper bound. The vertices which must be assigned to certain stages in advance are called prior vertices. 
If the area-balanced constraint cannot be satisfied, the upper bound on execution time must be relaxed 
minimally so that vertices can be relocated. 
A. Clustering Phase 
A clustering algorithm is used to contract heavily interconnected vertices together. In this way, the graph 
representing the circuit system becomes simplified and the computation complexity of partitioning is 
minimized. 
We first define a few terms related to our clustering method. A cone tipped at v is a subgraph such that 
any path connecting a vertex in the cone and v lies entirely in the cone and is denoted cone(v). A single 
fan-out cone (SFC) tipped at v is a cone such that except for v, every fan-out vertex of a vertex u in the cone 
must also be in the cone and is denoted SFC(v). If a set of vertices has many intra-connections and few 
inter-connections, the set of vertices can be clustered together. The single fan-out cone algorithm is usually 
used in technology mapping step and circuit partitioning [9]–[11] to find an SFC which contains the 
maximum number of vertices with a constraint on the number of fan-ins. A large SFC will have a large 
number of intra-connections because the fan-outs of all vertices except for the cone tip are fed to the vertices 
inside the cone. Similar to the approach used to find the single fan-out cone (SFC) for technology mapping, 
our clustering algorithm finds the maximal SFC. The clustering algorithm is shown below. We construct the 
cluster graph Gc by collapsing each cluster into one vertex. The area of the cluster vertex ci is given by 
∑ w(v)v∈Ci . Let n be the number of vertices in the precedence graph. The complexity of the clustering 
algorithm is bounded by O(n2). It can be shown that the cluster graph Gc is acyclic if the precedence graph Gp 
is acyclic. 
B. Partitioning Phase.  
 7
C. Iterative Improvement Phase 
The third phase refines the solution obtained in the second phase by using an iterative improvement 
method. Assume v is a vertex in the subset P1 or P2, but not a virtual vertex. The α	value of v,	α(v), is defined 
as follows. 
αሺvሻ= ൜|{u:u is in P1 and u is a fan-out vertex of v}|, if v is in P1  |{u:u is in P2 and u is a fan-in vertex of v}|, if v is in P2 			 
To satisfy the precedence constraint, we can only move a vertex v with α(v) = 0 to the other subset. A 
vertex v is said to be movable if α(v) = 0. We count the reduction in the communication cost for each movable 
vertex v if it is moved to the other partite-set. The vertex with the largest gain is moved if the partitioning 
solution is still feasible after this movement. In order to escape from the local optimal trap in the solution 
space, movements with negative gains are allowed. We store the partitioning results in the sequence of 
movements and select the best result as the final solution. After a vertex is moved, in order to avoid an infinite 
loop, it is locked and thus cannot be moved in the following steps. When all vertices are either locked or 
determined to be infeasible for moving, the iterative improvement procedure stops. 
五、 結果與討論 
We implemented our performance oriented partitioning algorithm, conducted the experiments on MCNC 
Partitioning93 benchmark circuits, and then compared our results to those from three of the best partitioning 
approaches in the literatures, the sequential network-flow-based algorithm FBPm [7], the probability-based 
approach PAT [8], and the hierarchical network-flow-based algorithm FBPh [6]. As in other algorithms, the 
target architecture of the implementation of the tested circuit systems is the DRFPGA of the same model in 
which a circuit is partitioned into eight stages. Table I shows the experimental results of performance. In 
column 4, l is the length of the critical real path described in Section IV. Column 5 lists the lower bound of the 
execution cost (ECost), which is equal to ڿ݈ 8⁄ ۀ. Column 6 lists the experimental results of the execution cost
