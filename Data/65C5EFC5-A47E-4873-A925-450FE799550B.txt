proportional to the discharge of debris flows energy. Accordingly, debris flow should be detectable whenever the 
amplitude of the ground vibrations exceeds some threshold over a certain range of frequency for more than a 
period. 
In Taiwan, several debris flows have been detected by (Yin, 2005 and Huang et al. [6]) using the 
geophones. However, Huang et al. [7] noted that compared to the ground vibration caused by earthquake, the 
ground tremors caused by debris flows are significantly smaller in a higher-frequency range. The attenuation of 
the seismic waves depends on the frequency, thus high frequency corresponds to a high decay rate. Hence, debris 
flow tremors can only be detected within a relatively short distance. Although this shortcoming can be 
compensated for by installing sensors close to the main stream of debris flows, the deployment of long cables 
causes not only high attenuation of the signals but also the transmission uncertainty in the mountainous region. 
Due to the low transmission loss of the signals in the fibers, in this paper we propose a fiber-optic geophone for 
detecting the ground vibrations produced by debris flows. The applicability of this instrument is demonstrated by 
comparing the detected ground vibration signals with those obtained by the traditional electro-mechanic 
geophones. 
2. THE DESIGN of FIBER OPTIC GEOPHONE 
The fiber optic geophone is based on the principle that when the underground sound acts on the optical fiber, 
it will induce a strain. Therefore, the light beam will induce phase shift in optical fiber. Because bare fiber has 
lower sensitivity, we used a mandrel to increase its sensitivity [8, 9]. 
The configuration of the fiber optic sensor is an air-backed mandrel structure. The fiber is wounded around 
a plastic hollow elastic tube. The pressure fluctuation induced by the vibration will change the diameter on 
mandrel. When fibers suffer radial pressure, the relationship between radial strain and pressure is as follows [8]: 
3
dr P
r B
−=  (1) 
where, P is the sound pressure, r is the mandrel radius, and B is the bulk modulus. Therefore, the sensitivity is: 
BdP
d
3
ξ
φ
φ −=  (2) 
Here, ψ is optical phase delay, and ξ is strain optic coefficient factor. 
    The existence of air gap in mandrel can increase the compliance of the whole structure. As a result, it 
induces fiber to change its length. We can calculate NR (Normalized responsivity) of thin shell and air-back 
mandrel type sensor with cylindrical structure. The result is [8]: 
)

1( νξφ
φ −−=
Yt
r
dP
d  (3) 
where, r is the mandrel radius, Y is Young’s Modulus of the mandrel, t is the outer thickness of cylinder, and ν is 
Poisson’s ratio. 
    From Eq. (3), the sensitivity of fiber optic sensor can be improved by adjusting the thickness of cylindrical 
shell. If the mandrel is made of metallic thin shell material, it just needs to be coated thinly with elastic material 
to obtain high sensitivity. The definition of natural frequency of a thin cylinder is [11]:

Eq. (12) is the relationship between phase shift of light and sound pressure when optical fiber is acted by 
sound pressure. The physical meaning of β’ is the equivalent wave of light by sound pressure per unit length. 
3.2 Mathematical model 
If signal of sound is P = P0 sin ωαt, where P0 is sound wave amplitude, and ωα is the angular frequency. If 
sound pressure is function of time and position, P (t, x), then,

    When interferometer does not suffer external stress, the first item is the phase when light beam transmit in 
one circle. For Sagnac Interferometer, both clockwise and counterclockwise light beam have equal optical path, 
then ψ0 = βL. The second item is phase shift of light affected by sound pressure. According to Eq. (14), the phase 
shift of ψcw (t) and ψccw (t) in fiber is as follow.

reveals another choice on sensing system. From the results, we can say that fiber optic sensor is suitable for 
applying to detect debris flow ground sound.
