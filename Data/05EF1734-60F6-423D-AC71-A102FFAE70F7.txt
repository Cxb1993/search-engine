              the Statistical Performance Fluctuations  
             (此成果已發表於 E-MRS Conference 2012) 
 
Abstract: A method for evaluating the sensitivity of the liquid-gate nanowire-based (NW) 
biosensors has been used to suppress the impact of the statistical performance fluctuations on 
optimizing the sensitivity of biosensors. As a result, the NW biosensor can be operated at its 
optimized sensitivity by applying an appropriate liquid-gate voltage for the label-free, 
real-time detection of the biomolecules at ultra-low concentration (~fM). 
 
Introduction: Over the last decade, nanowire-based (NW) devices are of interest for the 
potential applications of the highly sensitive biological and chemical biosensors [1,2]. 
Recently, the improved sensitivity of NW biosensor in the subthreshold regime had been 
experimentally observed [3]. However, the significant statistical fluctuation in the electrical 
performance of NW devices is the crucial issue for reliably operating all NW devices at their 
optimized sensitivity; it will limit the practical applications of NW devices to the highly 
sensitive diseases diagnosis areas. The basic sensing principles of NW biosensors including 
some parameters of the statistical fluctuations are shown in Figure 1.  
 
Electrical Properties and Fluctuations in NW Devices: The n-type polycrystalline silicon 
(poly-Si) NW devices were fabricated by utilizing CMOS compatible processes as described in 
the previous reports [4,5]. The source and drain contacts were passivated entirely by a thick 
SiO2 layer to decrease the ionic leakage current from the solution environment [6]. The SEM 
image of NW device is demonstrated in Figure 2(a). The size of NW can be extracted as 
~60-70 nm (Figure 2(b)).  
   The electrical characteristics of NW devices were measured in the ambient environment. 
The drain current plotted with respect to the back-gate voltage (VBG) is shown in Figure 
3(left), indicating the typical n-type behavior. The ID-VD curves with various VBG are shown 
in Figure 3(right). The calculated results for the surface-to-volume ratio with respect to NW 
size are plotted in Figure 4. It is well-know that the statistical fluctuations in threshold 
voltage and electrical performance of electronic devices cannot be ignored when the feature 
sizes of devices are scaled down to the nano-scale, especially in the case of NW devices. The 
subthreshold characteristics measured from 50 different devices on a single wafer are 
depicted in Figure 5. The statistical distribution of the threshold voltages measured from 50 
NW devices is also shown in Figure 6. Therefore, it remains highly unlikely that we could 
control all NW biosensors to operate with optimized sensitivity performance when applying 
the same operational bias conditions. Hence, how to evaluate and optimize the sensitivity of 
 Conclusion: We have fabricated the liquid-gate NW biosensor system comprising a 
microfluidic channel for highly sensitive biosensor applications. The impact of the statistical 
fluctuations on optimizing the sensitivity of NW devices can be suppressed using a method 
for evaluating the sensitivity. Therefore, the NW biosensor can be used to directly detect the 
biomolecules at ultra-low concentration by applying an appropriate Vlg to electrically 
optimize its sensitivity.

integrated nanochips,7 potentially replacing Si in commercial nanoFETs,8 because of their 
extremely high carrier mobilities9 and tunable bandgaps.10,11 The semiconducting 
characteristics of GNRFETs featuring a GNR width of less than 10 nm have been 
demonstrated experimentally,7 suggesting that continuous improvements in patterning 
technology will be necessary if narrow GNRs are to be fabricated to meet the future needs of 
the nanoelectronics industry. Furthermore, the effect of long-range charge scattering arising 
from the charged centers during carrier transport in graphene-based nanodevices has recently 
been highlighted.12-14 As a result, it is highly likely that when the GNR width is scaled down 
to be comparable with the charge scattering length,12 the charged dielectric defects will play a 
critical role in determining the physical characteristics of the GNRFETs. Nevertheless, 
relatively little is known about the capture kinetics behind the formation of interfacial 
charged dielectric defects in GNRFETs. Efforts dedicated to investigating the short-distance 
charge capture kinetics should shed light on the mechanism of long-range charged defect 
scattering and the physical origin of charge noise in GNRFETs. 
In this study of short-distance channel–defect interactions in GNRFETs, we used correlated 
nonradiative multiphonon (NMP) theory in conjunction with the Coulomb energy (∆E) to 
theoretically investigate the charge capture rate. To evaluate the values of ∆E, we developed a 
quantum capacitive circuit considering the effect of the fringing electrical field distributed 
spatially in the dielectric. The calculated short-distance charge capture rate for the channel 
subbands at room temperature revealed a significant correlation between the capture rate and 
the singularity characteristics of the 1D density-of-states (DOS). 
It has been widely believed that charge capture through the NMP transition is responsible 
for the short-distance interactions between the channel carriers and the interfacial dielectric 
defects that are typically located within a few nanometers of the dielectric–channel 
interface.15-17 Furthermore, by incorporating ∆E, regarded as the total work done by the 
voltage sources, into NMP theory, the experimental results for the short-distance charge 
single-layer graphene22 have recently attracted much attention because its bandgap is tunable 
depending on the a-GNR width, the crystallographic orientation, and the edge effect.10,11 In 
this 1D quantum system, the DOS for the ith subband in a-GNR can be written as 
                    DiE= g
π√3ta
|E|
E2-Ei2
×U(|E|-|Ei|),                          (2) 
where g is the degenerate factor, t is the first-neighbor hopping integral and a is the graphene 
lattice constant; i and U are an integer (±1, ±2, …) and the unitstep function, respectively; En 
is the subband energy defined by a band structure model using a tight-binding calculation 
with considerations of the effects of C–C bond-length contraction at the GNR edge and K–K´ 
orbital splitting.23 The bandgap Eg for a-GNR with a width W can be expressed as: 
Eg=2|α|·πℏυf/W, where υf is the Fermi velocity (ca. 1 × 106 m/s).23 Thus, values of Eg of 
0.454 and 0.221 eV correspond to values of Na of 21 and 42, respectively, where Na is the 
number of dimer lines across the a-GNR width; the corresponding widths of a-GNR are 
approximately 2.4 and 5.0 nm, respectively. Figure 2(a) displays the calculated quantum 
capacitance (CQ) normalized to the GNR width, defined as CQ= eW
∂n1D
∂Vch
, for values of Na of 21 
and 42. Because of the abundance of the DOS at the bottom of the 1D subband, peaks 
appeared in the values of CQ of the GNR when µ approached each subband energy level. 
Furthermore, to obtain the quantum capacitive circuit for the evaluation of ∆E, we performed 
simulations using the finite element method (FEM) to calculate the gate capacitance CG 
including the effect of the fringing electrical field distributed spatially in SiO2 dielectrics in 
the direction of the GNR’s width. To highlight the effect of the fringing electrical field on the 
value of CG, Figure 2(b) displays the calculated values of CG normalized to the GNR width W 
multiplied by the dielectric thickness tox. The simulated values of CG for values of tox of 1 nm 
(blue triangles), 3 nm (red dots), and 30 nm (black squares) are plotted with respect to GNR 
widths ranging from 1000 to 2 nm. Moreover, the planar gate capacitances are also displayed 
as a solid line in Fig. 2(a), determined using the expression: Cpla=κϵ0/tox, where κ is the 
considering the neutral dielectric defect, which can be regarded as an atomic point, located at 
the interface between the GNR and the SiO2 gate dielectric, the value of ∆E accounting for 
the total work done by the voltage sources can be obtained17,26

where QG possessing opposite polarity to the trapped charge is the image charge at the 
top-gate electrode side. In a practical sense, when an electron is inserted into the neutral 
interface defect, an amount of positive charge QG will be simultaneously transferred from the 
ground through the gate voltage source to the top-gate electrode (inset to Figure 3). Fig. 3 
displays a semilogarithmic plot of the calculated values of ∆E with respect to the electron 
density per unit area, for values of Na of 21 and 42. We attribute the larger magnitude of ∆E at 
a value of tox of 1 nm to the larger value of QG as the result of the higher value of CG, relative 
to that of the 30-nm-thick system. Moreover, the ripples in the plot of ∆E may be due to the 
peaks featured in the plot of CQ [Fig. 2(a)], originating fundamentally from the singularity 
feature of the 1D DOS. Notably, in contrast to the decreasing values of ∆E upon increasing 
the carrier density of bulk Si MOSFETs from a few hundreds of millielectronvolts (ca. 250 
meV) to a few tens of millielectronvolts in the region of high carrier density,17,26 the values of 
∆E for a-GNRFETs featuring 1- and 30-nm SiO2 dielectrics displayed increasing trends 
accompanied by apparent ripple characteristics, resulting in a value of ∆E of approximately 
400 meV at a high electron density of approximately 1017 m–2.  
 
B. Nonradiative multiphonon transition 
Previous studies16,17 have revealed that the capture kinetics for the short-distance 
charge-defect interaction can be described physically using NMP theory in conjunction with 
values of ∆E. Using this approach, the capture rate (Pc,i) for the trapping of a channel electron 
from the ith subband of the GNR to the interface defect through a short-distance NMP 
meV for SiO2 dielectric defect,16,29 we used eq. (4) to calculate the NMP capture rate for each 
subband. To investigate the impact of the values of the S on the charge capture kinetics, 
Figure 4 displays the calculated results for values of S of 50 and 100 corresponding to lattice 
relaxation energy of 1 and 2 eV, respectively. Because of the higher electron occupation 
probabilities for the lower subbands, only the capture rates for the lowest three subbands are 
considered here. At present, we lack sufficient information to theoretically evaluate the 
constant factor σ0,i for each channel subband. Therefore, we divided the calculated value of 
Pc,i by the constant factor σ0,i to investigate the short-distance capture kinetics [Figs. 4(a) and 
4(b)]. The vertical dotted lines corresponding to each energy level of the channel subbands 
for values of Na of 21 and 42 are plotted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. We find that the 
defect with a lower value of S had the higher charge capture rate. More importantly, the plots 
of Pc,i/σ0,i for each subband feature several consecutive peaks commonly located at specific 
energy levels. By comparing the relative position between the peaks and the subband energy 
levels, we conclude that the peaks in the plots of Pc,i/σ0,i appear only when the value of µ is 
nearly aligned with each subband energy level. As a result, the decrease in the value of ∆E 
originating from the peaks in the plot of CQ will greatly enhance the short-distance capture 
rate. Notably, the total capture rate, summed statistically from the contribution of each 
subband by using the occupation weighting, would reveal consecutive peak features similar 
to the calculated results illustrated in Fig. 4. More extensively, if the value of µ were to be 
manipulated intentionally at the position of each valley in the capture rate, the lower NMP 
capture rate for short-distance channel–defect interactions would probably diminish the 
long-range charged defect scattering in GNRFETs. 
 
IV. Discussion and Conclusions 
Rather than employing the classical Shockley–Read–Hall theory, which has been used to 
describe a capture process displaying a linearly proportional relationship between the charge 
role of the value of ∆E in the short-distance charge capture of GNRFETs. This study not only 
paves the way toward an elaboration of the capture kinetics for short-distance channel–defect 
interactions in 1D nanoFETs but also suggests that such systems can be applied in the fields 
of 1D nanoelectronics, single-charge nano-memories,33,34 and single-electron 
nanodevices.35,36

Resume : Over the last decade, nanowire-based (NW) devices are of 
interest for the potential applications of the highly sensitive biological and 
chemical biosensors [1-4]. Recently, the improved sensitivity of NW 
biosensor in the subthreshold regime had been experimentally observed [5]. 
However, the significant statistical fluctuation in the electrical performance 
of NW devices is the crucial issue for reliably operating all NW devices at 
their optimized sensitivity; it will limit the practical applications of NW 
devices to the highly sensitive diseases diagnosis area. A non-destructive 
method for evaluating the sensitivity of the liquid-gate nanowire-based 
(NW) biosensors has been demonstrated to suppress the impact of the 
statistical performance fluctuations on the sensitivity performance of NW 
biosensors. Thereby, the NW biosensor can be operated at its highest 
sensitivity by applying an appropriate liquid-gate voltage for the detection of 
the biomolecules at ultra-low concentration (~fM). [1] Cui, Y. et al., Science,
