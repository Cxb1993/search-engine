materials to format (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 compositions by using solid state 
reaction method. The influences of sintering temperatures and compositions on the crystal structures and sintering 
characteristics of all compositions are developed. It is found that only the La2O3-0.7 SiO2 composition revealed the 
crystal structure of single-phase, and its dielectric characteristics are well developed for further application by 
sputtering method to fabricate non-SiO2 gate dielectrics. 
2. Experimental procedures 
The ceramic materials (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 were prepared by the solid 
state reaction method. Reagent-grade raw materials of TiO2, ZrO2, La2O3, and SiO2 with higher than 99.5% purity were 
used as starting materials, mixed according to the compositions (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2 (x=0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), (1-x) ZrO2-x 
SiO2 (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8), and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2  (x=0.6, 0.7, and 0.8), respectively. After ball-milled for 5h with 
deionized water, dried, and ground, then the all powders were calcined at 1100oC for 2h. After calcinations, the powders 
were ground again, then polyvinylalcohol (PVA) was added as a binder. The calcining powders were uniaxially pressed 
into pellets in a steel die with the size of 1mm in thick and 12mm in diameter. After debindering, sintering of these 
pellets was carried out from 1400oC to 1550o C for 2h. The crystal structures of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, 
and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 ceramics were investigated using XRD patterns. After the analysis, it is found that only the 0.3 
La2O3-0.7 SiO2 ceramics will reveal a crystal structure of single-phase, La2Si2O7. For that the morphologies of 0.3 
La2O3-0.7 SiO2 ceramics were observed by using scanning electronic micrograph (SEM). The sintered (1-x) TiO2-x 
SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 ceramics were painted with Ag-Pd paste and sintered at 700
oC for 
15min. The dielectric characteristics of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 ceramics were 
measured at 1MHz with an oscillating amplitude (50mV) by an HP4194 impedance analyzer. 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig.1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2 ceramics, as a function of sintering temperatures 
and SiO2 content. The crystal structures  of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2 ceramics are similar and independent of the sintering 
temperatures and SiO2 content. The X-ray analysis find that even 1550
oC is used as the sintering temperature, a solid 
solution are not formatted in the (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2 compositions (x=0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), and the TiO2 and SiO2 are 
coexisted as independent crystal phases. Using the crystal intensity of TiO2 phase as  the index, the crystal intensity of 
SiO2 increases with the increase of SiO2 content and slightly decreases with the increase of sintering temperatures.

also be changed. These results prove that forming a single-phase would be the important topic to find a material 
composition as a non-SiO2 gate dielectric. Fig.4 shows the dielectric constants of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, 
and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 ceramics as a function of SiO2 content, the sintering temperature is 1500
oC. The dielectric 
constants of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2 ceramics critically and the dielectric constants of (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2 and (1-x) La2O3-x 
SiO2 ceramics slightly decrease with the increase of SiO2 content. The results demonstrate that the addition of TiO2, 
ZrO2, and La2O3 into the SiO2 will increase the dielectric constants.

Fig.4 The dielectric constants of (1-x) TiO2-x SiO2, (1-x) ZrO2-x SiO2, and (1-x) La2O3-x SiO2 ceramics as a function 
of SiO2 content, the sintering temperature is 1500
o C. 
As Fig.4 shows, the dielectric constants of 0.3 La2O3-0.7 SiO2 ceramics are lower than the other compositions. 
However, because of the existence of single-phase of La2Si2O7, the sintering and dielectric characteristics of the 0.3 
La2O3-0.7 SiO2 ceramics are further developed. From the micrographs observation of Fig.5, it is found that the 0.3 
La2O3-0.7 SiO2 (La2Si2O7) ceramics can be densified at about 1450
oC even the pores are still observed. Figure 5 shows 
the dielectric characteristics. As Fig.6 shows, the dielectric constant increases and the loss tangent decreases with the 
increase of sintering temperatures, the decrease of pores will cause this result . The La2Si2O7 ceramic has a dielectric 
constant of 15~19, which is higher than that of SiO2. And the loss tangent is in the range of 1.5~2.5%, which is lower 
enough for gate dielectric used. For that the La2Si2O7 ceramics can be developed as the target of sputtering method to 
fabricate high dielectric constant gate dielectric.
