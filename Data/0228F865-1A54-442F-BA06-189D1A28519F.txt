ABSTRACT 
Prior studies indicated that mechanical loading influences turnover of cell and extracellular 
matrix in tissues. Mechanical stimuli thus could play an important role in engineering artificial 
tissues. We used fibroblast–seeded collagen gels as a model to study mechano-biological 
responds under defined biaxial mechanical loading. While most studies focus on tissues subjected 
to uniaxial mechanical constraint, effects of multi-axial loading on tissue development is not clear. 
Under defined static mechanical conditions, cell-seeded collagen gels show irreversible 
micro-structural change after six days in culture. That demonstrates that micro-structure of 
engineered tissues can be tailored with mechanical conditioning. The functionality of some 
engineered tissues is associated with their mechanical properties. We thus verified that the same 
mechanical constraint also lead to a significant mechanical anisotropy that correlated to the fiber 
alignment and established a link between the two. Furthermore, mechanical properties of gels 
followed by cell removal also showed significant mechanical anisotropy, which demonstrated a 
irreversible matrix remodeling as suggested by previous imaging results. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides vital structural integrity for many tissues and 
organs and plays equally important biological roles by influencing cell behaviors. Amongst the 
many types of cells within the ECM, fibroblasts play a particularly important role by producing, 
maintaining, reorganizing, and degrading components of the matrix during normal development, 
tissue maintenance, adaptation, disease progression, and wound healing. Fibroblast-seeded 
collagen gels have thus been used as model systems to study cell-matrix interactions in tissue 
morphogenesis and wound healing [1-3]. Specifically in tissue engineering, the property of 
3 
 
constant the stress within the matrix, a phenomenon that has been called “tensional homeostasis” 
[10-14]. For example, fibroblasts appear to establish a preferred endogenous tension when 
introduced into otherwise unstressed collagen gels; indeed, it appears that this tension is essential 
for cell survival. Tensional homeostasis is often associated with realignment or remodeling of the 
collagen fibers, yet much remains unknown with regard to effects due to imposed mechanical 
loads or boundary conditions, roles of cell mediated alignment, and cellular production or 
removal of fibers. 
 
METHODS 
Preparation of cell-seeded collagen gel. 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM 
containing 10% calf serum and antibiotics, and passaged for every 3-4 days. Cell-contained 
collagen solution was prepared on ice and poured into a cruciform silicone mold that is affixed to 
a Petri-dish. The final densities of cell and collagen were 1106 per ml and 2.83mg /ml, 
respectively. After gelation, the mold was removed and fresh medium was added. The gel was 
placed in culture for 24 hr to allow cells to integrate with collagen matrix. The mechanical 
properties of the central region of the gel (Day 0) were examined. 
Biaxial tissue culture device and culturing conditions. A custom biaxial tissue culture 
device was built to impart well defined biaxial stretches to a cruciform shaped cell-seeded 
collagen gel [15].  Briefly, the device is made of polycarbonate and stainless steel and can be 
autoclaved for sterilization. Cruciform shaped, fibroblast-seeded collagen gels were clamped 
within the device via embedded porous polyethylene bars at each end of the four arms and 
stretched to a prescribed extent (Figure 1A): uniaxial stretch (λy=1.2) or strip biaxial stretch (λx: 
λy= 1.01: 1.2). The chamber was then covered and placed in a 37C humidified CO2 incubator for 
5 
 
tests were, in fact, performed twice (the first time is right after the equibiaxial preconditioning 
and the second time is done during the proportional tension-controlled tests). The tension-strain 
curves were compared, ensuring that the loading is within the elastic range of the gels. 
Statistical Analysis: Differences between groups were assessed via one-way ANOVA in 
conjunction with Holm-Sidak post-hoc testing, with an overall significance level p = 0.05. Results 
are reported as mean  standard deviation. 
 
RESULTS 
Validation of the Biaxial Mechanical Tester. Using an isotropic cell-seeded collagen gel 
(day-0 gel), we demonstrated that the equibiaxial displacement scheme could introduce very 
similar E11 and E22 with minimal E12 at the central region of the gel (Fig. 3A & B). It is thus 
justified that the global displacement can be converted into local strain in our setup. As the 
cell-seeded collagen gel contains a significant amount of water, we examined the viscous effect 
on the determination of mechanical properties. Fig. 4 showed that the strain rate can be a factor in 
determining the stress-strain curves. Thus we chose to use quasi-static loading when testing the 
gels.  
Biaxial Mechanical Properties of Cell-Seeded Collagen Gels. Mechanical properties of 
cell-seeded gels were examined by the biaxial mechanical tester. Fig. 5 showed the mechanical 
properties of day-0 cell-seeded gels (5A) and that of cell-seeded gels cultured under strip biaxial 
stretching for six days (5B). While day-0 gels showed isotropic mechanical behavior, the 
mechanical anisotropy, potentially caused by the preferred fiber alignment along the long arm, 
was illustrated in Fig. 5B. Note that the stiffness in the y direction is greater than that in the x 
direction or that of a day-0 gel. We subjected cell-seeded gels to osmotic shock and thus 
7 
 
unstretched control (Figure 2A), increasing the degree of preferential stretching in one direction 
(e.g., Figure 2C) increased the alignment of the fibers within the central region toward the 
direction of stretching. Indeed, given that the “short arms” and “long arms” of the cruciform 
shaped sample provided further extremes in preferential stretching (Figure 1), it was not 
surprising that such stretching was an effective way to align the fibers along the direction of 
stretch. We emphasize, however, that alignment was purposely measured within the central 
regions of each of the three portions of the specimen studied (Figure 1B) and that alignment was 
likely even greater near the free edges in the short and long arms (cf. Tower et al. [17]; Costa et al. 
[18]). 
Collagen fiber alignment was observed to depend on culture time and region, i.e., 
boundary conditions imposed by mechanical constraints. In the SA region, fiber alignment was 
induced gradually by the cell traction that developed between the two anchors. Following the 
same mechanism, the relatively weak fiber alignment established by the applied stretch at the 
onset of gel contraction was enhanced over time in the LA region. These aligned fibers may have 
provided environmental cues for the cells to reorient via contact guidance [19, 20]. Although not 
directly examined in this study, aligned cells may synthesize collagen fibers with preferred 
orientations [21] and thus contribute to overall changes in fiber orientation. In fact, interactive 
processes between cell and matrix have been shown in tissue remodeling (see [14] for a review). 
In both LA and SA regions, in which lateral constraints were absent, alignment increased with 
duration of culture over 6 days (Figure 3). This was consistent with the well-known directed 
collagen contraction in uniaxially constrained, rectangular fibroblast-seeded collagen gels [4-6]. 
Moreover, we found that in the central (CT) region, collagen anisotropy remained consistent over 
6 days of culture with that imposed initially, suggesting biaxial as opposed to uniaxial constraints 
9 
 
as a metric of fibroblast mediated matrix remodeling, the anisotropy observed on days 3 and 6 
suggests that the rate of remodeling was the same in the LA and SA regions (Figure 4). In other 
words, the rate of matrix remodeling was not different between regions with a step increase in 
stretch of 20% versus simple anchoring after 3 days. This was seen in Figures 4B & 4D where 
cell free AIs of the LA and SA regions were similar at each time point. Note, too, that at day 6 
fiber alignment within the stretched state in the LA region appeared to be stronger than that in the 
SA region, thus suggesting a significant contribution by the applied stretch on fiber alignment.   
Marenzana et al. [23] used scanning electron microscopy to show similarly significant 
alignment in uniaxially constrained collagen gels. Using a transducer to monitor directly the 
forces generated by fibroblast populated collagen gels over 60 hours of culture, they showed that 
tension results from a combination of cell-mediated traction and a gradually increasing “residual 
matrix tension”. They suggested that this residual matrix tension, which accounted for ~50% of 
measured force after 60 hours of culture, indicated “a time-dependent shortening of the collagen 
network, progressively stabilized into a built-in tension within the matrix.” Although our results 
do not address possible shortening of the fibers, the entrenched realignment is consistent with the 
existence of a residual matrix tension that is presumably related to a tendency towards tensional 
homeostasis. A similar “stable remodeling” of collagen gels by fibroblasts was reported by 
Sawhney and Howard [24], who emphasized the importance of fibroblast-generated traction 
fields in remodeling the matrix as reemphasized by Dahlmann-Noor et al. [25]. 
Finally, note that the measured alignment index necessarily provided an average over the 
field of view (~ 130 x 130 microns). It is expected that variations existed within such regions, 
particularly related to proximity of a collagen fiber to individual cells. Indeed, collagen fibers in a 
stretched gel tended to align parallel with dispersed cells (Figure 5A) whereas they tended to 
11 
 
engineering remains of high importance.  
Despite most soft tissues experiencing multiaxial loads in vivo (e.g., arteries, cornea, lung 
parenchyma, myocardium, pericardium, skin, and so forth), most tissue culture studies have 
focused on uniaxial loading or uniaxial constraints. It appears that Knezevic et al. [37] were the 
first to study biaxially loaded collagen gels. Thomopoulos et al. [22, 31] subsequently used this 
biaxial culture system to study the development of structural and mechanical anisotropy in planar 
gels over 3 days. Similar to findings herein, they reported that equibiaxial loading induced little 
structural or mechanical anisotropy (i.e., originally isotropically oriented fibers remained so) 
whereas uniaxial stretching induced marked realignment of fibers towards the direction of stretch.  
As noted in Humphrey et al. [15], two methods have proven particularly useful in biaxial 
mechanical testing of planar soft tissues: the use of arrays of sutures to couple square samples to 
the testing device and the use of end-clamps to couple cruciform samples to the device. Although 
neither experimental configuration is perfect, practical issues of introducing multiple sutures into 
very soft collagen gels (at day 0) suggests the potential utility of cruciform samples wherein ends 
can be secured well for loading. Waldman and Lee [38] showed in native pericardium, for 
example, that mechanical properties can be estimated consistently using cruciform shaped 
samples wherein the arms are 50 to 100 % of the length of the central region, but samples with 
arms only 5% of the length of the central region result in an overly constrained material with an 
artificially high stiffness. Whereas Thomopoulos et al. used biaxial specimens with very short 
arms [22, 31], our cruciform specimens had arms 200% of the length of the central region. 
Nevertheless, Waldman and Lee [38] further cautioned that “The sample arms underwent large 
deformations whereas a central region, defined by the principal fibre directions, tended to rotate 
towards the direction of stretch rather than to deform.” Complete characterization of biaxial 
13 
 
anisotropy with high fidelity. Sequential NLOM measurements of collagen fiber orientation 
distributions of gels stretched, unloaded, and with cells removed can also be used to delineate 
contributions of applied stretch, cell-mediated traction fields and matrix remodeling on measured 
collagen distributions. There is, therefore, great potential to explore further the effects of 
multiaxial loading on cell mediated collagen organization, information that is fundamental for 
increasing our understanding of native tissue mechanics as well as our ability to engineer 
functional tissue equivalents.
