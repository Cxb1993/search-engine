Abstract 
  An alkoxysilane compound possessing 
maleimide moiety (MSM) was prepared  
from N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)maleimide and 
3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and was 
used as a modifier of epoxy resins.  In situ 
curing epoxy resins with MSM resulted in 
epoxy resins with good homogeneity.  Only 
5-10 wt% MSM is enough to bring superior 
performance of high glass transition 
temperature (165 oC), good thermal stability 
above 360 oC, and high flame retardancy 
(LOI=30) to bisphenol-A based epoxy resins.

2. Introduction and background 
  Epoxy resins are one of the most  
important thermosetting materials using as 
insulators in printed circuit boards and 
electronic/electrical industries.  Recently, 
new challenges accompanying with 
developments of advanced package 
techniques, halogen-free issues, and lead- 
free processes come to epoxy resins.  To 
meet the criteria for applications of future, 
halogen-free epoxy resins exhibiting good 
flame retardancy and excellent thermal 
stability above 300 oC are highly expected.1 
  Halogen-free flame retardant epoxy 
resins have been widely studied with an focus    
on phosphorus-containing compounds.2-13  
Nowadays, one trend of developments     
of epoxy resins is replacement of 
phosphorylated epoxy resins with phosphorus 
-free formulations,14-17 to avoid the problems 
of relatively poor thermal stability, hydrolysis 
character, and undefined toxicity which 
generate from phosphorus compounds.  
Another trend is increase of flame   
retardant efficiency of epoxy resins with 
developing synergistic systems of flame 
reatrdants.8,10-11,18-19 Moreover, enhancement 
of thermal stability of epoxy resins is also 
attractive, as high processing temperatures 
are employed in the advanced packing 
techniques and lead-free processes.1  Major 
approaches are formation of epoxy-silica 
nanocomposites18-25 and modification of 
epoxy resins with nitrogen-containing 
heterocyclic compounds containing imide 
and triazine groups.12,14,26-28   
Basing on the above accounts, the target 
of this work is trying to bring halogen   
-free and phosphorus-free characteristics, 
synergistic effect of flame retardancy, and 
good thermal stability to epoxy resins with an 
“one-pot” modification.  An alkoxysilane 
compound possessing maleimide     
moiety (MSM) was prepared from 
N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)maleimide and

4. Results and Discussion 
4.1 Preparation of hybrid monomer MSM 
One-end functionalized trialkoxysilanes 
are useful coupling agents for improvement 
of organic-inorganic interfacial compatibility.  
These compounds are also utilized as ceramic 
precursors for preparation of polymer-silica 
hybrid materials and nanocomposites.30 The 
organo-functional groups of silane 
compounds reacts with organic polymers to 
provide interfacial linkages between ceramic 
and polymeric domains.  On the other hand, 
one-end functional alkoxysilane compounds 
are also used as additives and 
property-improving agents for polymers.11,31  
Basing on this concept, an alkoxysilane 
compound with a maleimide functional group 
was prepared in this work, then the prepared 
maleimide-silane hybrid compound (MSM) 
was used as a modifier of epoxy resins.  
Figure 1 shows the preparation scheme of 
MSM, which was obtained through the 
addition reaction between oxirane and phenol 
group with using triphenylphosphine as a 
reaction promoter. Occurrence of this 
reaction was demonstrated with FTIR 
measurements (Figure 2). The absorption 
peaks of oxirane ring (910 cm-1) and Ph-O-H 
(3482 cm-1) vanished after the reaction. 
Appearance of the broad peak at 3385 cm-1 in 
the FTIR spectrum of the reaction product 
indicated the formation of secondary alcohol 
after the reaction.  Other characteristic 
absorption peaks for MSM were observed at 
2943 and 2874 (aliphatic C-H), 1775 (C=O 
asymmetrical stretching), 1714 (C=O 
symmetrical stretching), 1397 (C-N), 1150 
(C-N-C in maleimide ring), and 1094 
(Si-O-C) cm-1.  1H NMR analysis results of 
MSM further support its chemical structure 
with the characteristic absorption peaks at 
0.79 (Si-CH2-), 1.80 (SiCH2-CH2-), 2.13 
(Si-OCH3), 3.45-3.72 (-OCH2-), 6.79 
(-CH=CH- of maleimide ring), and 6.87-7.17 
(aromatic protons) ppm.

4.2 Preparation and Characterization of 
MSM modified epoxy resins 
MSM could be considered as a 
cross-linkable monomer.  The cross-linking 
reaction of MSM took place by means of 
self-addition reaction of maleimide groups 
and gel-reaction of hydrolyzed silanol groups.  
These reactions could perform under the 
curing conditions of epoxy resin.  Solely 
curing MSM resulted in a resin CMSM, 
which is hard, smooth, and transparent.  
CMSM exhibits superior properties, such as 
high glass transition temperature of 211 oC, 
good thermal stability above 360 oC, high 
char yield of 55 % (heating in nitrogen at 800 
oC), and high LOI value of 40. Thus, using 
MSM as an additive modifier for commercial 
bisphenol-A type epoxy resins is attractive. 
Preparation of MSM modified epoxy resins 
(MSMER) was then conducted with blending 
MSM sol solution and BE188/DDM solution 
together. The mixture was thermally cured 
under certain conditions.  Here MSM was 
utilized as an “additive-type” modifier, and 
performed as a “reactive-type” agent.29  
MSMER samples containing 5 to 30 wt% of 
MSM were prepared (Table 1).  MSMER is 
expected to possess silsesquioxane network 
(from sol-gel reactions of alkoxysilane 
groups), heterocyclic imide structure (from 
maleimide curing reaction), maleimide 
 6
distribution of MSM in the cured epoxy 
resins was further examined with SEM-EDS 
silicon mapping.  The results are also shown 
in Figure 4.  Certain amounts of silicon 
(shown as the bright dots), corresponding to 
the silsesquioxane structure, were observed to 
be homogeneously distributing in the 
measured window.  This distribution of 
silicon elements gave further evidence to the 
homogeneity of the MSMER samples.

4.3 Thermal analysis and flame retardancy 
The glass transition temperatures of the 
prepared epoxy resins were read from DSC 
measurements at a heating rate of 10 oC/min 
under nitrogen (Figure 5).  Figure 6 shows 
the plot of the glass transition temperatures of 
MSMER resins vs. the MSM contents in the 
resins. Significant improvement on the glass 
transition temperatures was observed with 
MSM modified epoxy resins (Figure 6).  A 
small amount MSM of 5 wt% leveled up the 
glass transition temperature of epoxy resins 
from 136 oC to 162 oC.  Increase of the 
MSM contents further increased the glass 
transition temperatures of MSMER resins.  
However, the amplitude of increase was not 
so obvious.  Such high Tg’s lead these 
modified epoxy resins be qualified for 
application in high Tg printed circuit boards 
and other advanced materials in 
microelectronics.  Both silsesquioxane 
network from silanol gel reaction and 
maleimide network from maleimide 
cross-linking reaction contribute to the high 
Tg’s of MSMER samples.  In general, 
alkoxysilane modified polymers with low 
alkoxysilane contents showed decreased Tg’s

4.4 Mechanical property of MSMER resins 
Figure 10 showed the DMA thermograms 
of MSMER-0, MSMER-10, and MSMER-20. 
The appearance of tanδpeaks in Figure 10 
indicated that a secondary phase transition 
occurred in this temperature regions.  As 
accompanying with a rapid decrease of 
storage modulus, this transition is assigned to 
be the transition from glassy to rubbery states, 
i.e. the glass transition.  The temperatures at 
tanδ peaks were the glass transition 
temperatures of the tested samples.  The 
glass transition temperatures of MSMER-20 
and MSMER-10 read from tanδ curves are 
188 and 178 oC, respectively, both are 15-20 
oC above the values read from DSC 
measurements and are higher than the glass 
transition temperature of MSMER-0 (141 oC).  
In addition, the high storage modulus and 
high glass transition temperature of 
MSMER-20 indicated its high cross-linking 
density in network.  MSMER-20 also 
showed relatively small values of tanδpeak 
and area under tanδcurve to indicate its 
reduced energy dissipation in deformation.
