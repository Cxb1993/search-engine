memory properties are performed. Memory window as higher as 5 V is achieved after P/E 
operation at ± 10V for 0.1sec. Besides, only 12% charge loss at room temperature after 10 
years storage. Only +0.5V window shift and almost no window narrowing after 105 P/E

Carrier Transport Mechanisms of the MSB MOSFETs 
 
I. Introduction 
Schottky-barrier (SB) source/drain MOSFETs have been proposed for future nano-scale 
devices because of easy process and small external resistance of source/drain [1-5]. However, the 
SB MOSFETs still have some drawbacks. Fig.1 shows the schematic energy band diagram of the 
n-channel SB MOSFET operating at on-state and off-state. The first drawback of the SB 
MOSFET is the smaller on-state driving current (Ion) than that of the conventional pn junction 
MOSFETs due to the SB between the silicide and the inverted channel. In the previous study, a 
method of using complementary low-barrier silicide : PtSi for PMOSFET and ErSi for 
NMOSFET, has been suggested to reduce this barrier [2-3]. The problem of high Ioff of SB 
MOSFETs comes from the carrier injection at the drain side is the second drawback [6]. 
Kedzierski et al. introduced the FinFET architecture on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and 
demonstrated low Ioff ~ 1nA/µm for 20x25 nm2 devices [7]. Adding a metal field-plate over the 
MOSFETs has been shown to be effective in reducing the Ioff by suppressing back-injection 
from the drain contact, but it requires an additional voltage supply and sacrifices device density 
[8]. 
Recently, modified Schottky barrier (MSB) MOSFETs has been proposed to overcome 
the drawbacks of SB MOSFETs. The MSB junction is a Schottky junction with a very thin but 
high concentration layer located at the metal/Si interface.  This high concentration layer could be 
accomplished by several methods, for example, implantation-to-silicide (ITS) method and dopant 
segregation (DS) method [9, 10]. Fig. 2 shows the schematic energy band diagrams of the n-
channel MSB MOSFETs. It has been confirmed that the MSB junction can suppress Ioff and 
improve Ion effectively. 
Although the carrier injection velocity of the MSB MOSFETs fabricated by the DS 
method has been studied [11], the current transport mechanism of MSB MOSFETs has not been 
reported. In this work, current transport mechanisms of SB and MSB MOSFETs are investigated 
by measuring the temperature effect on the current-voltage characteristics. Current transport 
mechanisms at different bias conditions are clarified.

where A* is the Richardson constant, T is the temperature, k is the Boltzman constant, q is the 
unit charge, φb is the Schottky barrier height, ∆φ is the image force lowering, ζ is the energy 
measured upward from the potential maximum, and η is the energy measured downward from the 
potential maximum. Fm and Fs are the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions of the metal and the 
semiconductor, respectively. Q(ζ) and Q(η) are the transmission coefficients above and below 
the potential maximum, respectively. 
From (1) and (2), both the thermionic emission component and the tunneling component 
exhibit positive temperature dependence and the thermionic emission component has stronger 
temperature dependence than the tunneling component. Therefore, the temperature dependence of 
the SB MOSFET should be in reverse trend of the conventional MOSFETs, that is, the higher 
temperature is, the higher the current is. The dominant component depends on the barrier height 
and barrier thickness. These barrier properties could be affected by doping concentration and 
electrical field. 
B. Schottky Barrier MOSFETs 
Fig.4 shows the typical Ids-Vgs characteristics of the SB MOSFET with W/L=80nm/5µm 
biasing as an n-channel device. Ambipolar phenomenon is clearly observed as expected. The Ids-
Vgs characteristics of the SB MOSFET shown in Fig.4 is redrawn in linear scale with Vds=0.05V 
in Fig.5(a). At both on-state and off-state, the current increases as the temperature increases. It 
should be noted that the temperature dependence at off-state is much stronger than that at on-state. 
It implies that electron-injection from source to the inverted channel tends to be dominated by the 
tunneling mechanism while the hole-injection from drain to the p-type body tends to be 
dominated by the thermionic emission mechanism. This inference is consistent with the fact that 
the electron barrier is higher than the hole barrier of the NiSi/Si SB junction [14]. 
Fig.5(b) shows the Ids-Vgs characteristics of the SB MOSFET shown in Fig.4 in linear 
scale with Vds=1V. The on-state current is still dominated by the tunneling mechanism. However, 
at off-state, the positive temperature dependence changes to negative temperature dependence as 
the Vgs decreases to lower than -2V. This phenomenon implies that the current transport 
mechanism changes from thermionic emission or tunneling to drift-diffusion. It is believed that 
the strong negative gate voltage and positive drain voltage induce barrier thickness thinning and 
barrier height lowering. As the hole-injection resistance from drain contact becomes low enough, 
the current flow becomes controlled by the drift-diffusion mechanism. 
 5
mechanism to drift-diffusion mechanism moves from 1.2V to 1.8V as the post-ITS annealing 
time decrease from 30 min to 30 sec. This result indicates that the insufficient post-ITS thermal 
budget (600ºC, 30sec) results in higher source injection resistance so that the current transport is 
more likely to be controlled by the tunneling mechanism. 
Fig.11 compares the Ids-Vgs characteristics of the MSB MOSFETs fabricated with post-
ITS thermal budget. It is observed that the MOSFET with higher thermal budget exhibits higher 
driving capability, better subthreshold swing, and lower off-state current. 
 
IV. Conclusions 
Current transport mechanisms of Schottky barrier (SB) and Modified Schottky barrier 
(MSB) MOSFETs could be identified by measuring the temperature effect on current-voltage 
characteristics. For SB MOSFETs, current transport could be dominated by thermionic emission 
or tunneling mechanism depends on the Schottky barrier height and the gate voltage. Drift-
diffusion current could occur at sufficient high electric field. The current transport of the MSB 
MOSFETs changes from tunneling mechanism to drift-diffusion mechanism as the gate voltage 
increases. The changing point is a good indicator to evaluate the efficiency of the MSB junction. 
Sufficient post-ITS thermal budget is required to obtain high performance MSB MOSFET. Since 
the current transport mechanism depends on bias condition, the extraction of mobility should be 
treated carefully, especially at low gate voltage.

nm thick poly-Si film deposition. The poly-Si gate was doped by P31+ ion implantation at 40 
KeV to a dose 5x1015 cm-2 followed by a rapid thermal activation at 1025°C for 10 sec. Then, 
a SiO2 (10nm)/Si3N4 (20nm) composite spacer was formed. The source/drain (S/D) region 
was converted into NiSi completely by a 2-step annealing silicidation process. To form the 
MSB S/D junction, P31+ ions were implanted into the nickel silicide (ITS) at 20 KeV to a dose 
5x1015 cm-2 followed by a post-ITS annealing step at 600°C for 30 min or 30 sec. During this 
annealing step, phosphorus ions diffused out of the silicide and piled up at Si/silicide interface 
to form the MSB junction [11]. For the reference devices, phosphorus ions were implanted 
into the S/D region at 10 KeV to a dose 5x1015 cm-2 followed by a rapid thermal activation at 
1025°C for 20 sec before Ni-salicide process. The silicide thickness is about 25nm thick. 
Fig.1 shows the typical transfer characteristics of MSB MOSFET with W/L=80nm/5µm 
biasing at VDS=0.05V and operating at different temperatures. The inset shows the schematic 
device structure. The on-state current increases with temperature increasing at low VGS. While 
at high VGS, the temperature dependence is reversed, and the intersecting point occurs at about 
VGS=1.35V. This intersection indicates that the on-current of the MSB MOSFET is dominated 
by thermionic emission mechanism or tunneling mechanism at low gate bias [10]. 
 
III. Modified External Loading Method 
The external loading method was proposed to extract the source/drain resistance of 
MOSFET by S. T. Hsu [12]. The benefit of this method is that only one device is measured 
and the extracted result is exactly the S/D resistance of the measured device. The inset in 
Fig.2 shows the circuit diagram of this method. An external load resistor with suitable range 
of impedance is connected to the source terminal. The total resistance of the circuit is 
composed of external load resistance (RL), source resistance (RS), drain resistance (RD), and 
channel resistance, where RS and RD depend on the properties of the MSB junction. The 
channel current (IDS) of the MOSFET operating at linear region is given by

In this work, a modified external load resistance method was proposed to extract the bias 
dependent source injection resistance of the MSB MOSFET. It is observed that the source 
injection resistance is exponentially proportional to (VGS-VTH-0.5VDS) and the S/D resistance 
of MSB MOSFET would be close to that of conventional MOSFET at moderate high gate 
bias. Without sufficient post-ITS thermal budget, the source injection resistance can not be 
suppressed effectively at reasonable VGS. This work provides a good method to evaluate the 
efficiency of the MSB junction directly.

simulation. Design guidelines are then recommended. 
 
II. Device Structures 
Sentaurus-TCAD tool was used to simulate the effects of MSB layer on device 
performance [20]. The fully-depleted MSB-SOI MOSFETs structure was defined by DEVISE. 
DESSIS in Sentaurus-TCAD is used to declare physical models and physical parameters, and 
to simulate electrical charcetristics. The schematic structures of the SB and MSB MOSFETs 
are shown in Fig.2(a) and 2(b), respectively. The fixed device parameters include silicon 
thickness tsi = 50 nm, gate oxide thickness tox =5nm, gate length Lg=0.35 µm, and substrate 
doping concentration Nsub=1017 cm-3. The variable device parameters are MSB layer doping 
concentration NMSB, MSB layer thickness tMSB, silicide thickness tM, and silicide 
work-function WFM. These parameters are summarized in Table-I. 
Bandgap narrowing model, recombination model, quantum mechanics model, and 
mobility model are included. The QCVanDort model was selected to consider the quantum 
effect of the inverted channel. For mobility model, three components were considered 
including Doping Dependence, High Field Saturation, and Enormal. Resistance of silicide 
was ignored because it contributes very low percentages of the total resistance. At silicide and 
silicon interface, the nonlocal tunneling model was used. In this nonlocal tunneling model, 
tunneling current includes thermionic current over the SB and tunneling current through the 
SB. The tunneling current depends on gate voltage by modulating the tunneling width at 
source-side, as shown in Fig.3. 
 
III. Results and Discussions 
A. Effect of the MSB layer doping concentration 
 Fig.4 shows the transfer characteristics of the MSB MOSFETs with tMSB=5nm and 
various NMSB. The off-current decreases as the NMSB increases. Fig.5 shows the simulated 
conduction band energy. At Vg=-1V, the MSB layer provides an effective barrier to hole and 
reduces the tunneling probability as is expected. In addition, the on-current is enhanced by 
increasing NMSB due to the lowering of the effective SBH. 
At low NMSB (5x1018 cm-3), piecewise linear subthreshold characteristic is observed. This 
phenomenon can be explained by the conduction band diagram shown in Fig.6. At low Vg 
(-0.2V), after tunneling through the SB, carriers encountered the channel potential barrier. 
The total conductance is dominated by the gate field induced channel potential barrier 
 27
MOSFETs with tMSB=1nm and 3nm, respectively. For the devices with tMSB=1nm, the effect 
of WFM is apparent. As the WFM decreases, the transfer characteristics become more 
conventional-like. For the devices with tMSB=3 nm, the transfer characteristics is very 
conventional- like behavior even if the WFM equals to 4.6eV. However, the WFM affect the 
tunneling resistance at source contact. As the WFM decreases from 4.6eV to 4.4eV, a 46% 
increase of on-current is obtained. Further decreasing to 4.3eV, additional 5% improvement is 
obtained. 
VI. Conclusions 
Effects of MSB layer on the performance of MSB MOSFETs are evaluated by TCAD 
simulation. With high NMSB doping concentration and/or thick tMSB, the MSB layer reduces 
the effective SBH at source effectively; therefore, the device behaves like the conventional 
MOSFETs. As NMSB<3x1019 cm-3 or tMSB<3nm, the MSB layer would be fully depleted easily 
which results in feckless of this MSB layer. 
Thickness and workfunction of the silicide film are also important parameters. Due to the 
high sheet resistance of the MSB layer, the current tunneling through the lower part of the 
sidewall interface and the bottom interface decreases with the increase of the silicide 
thickness. Therefore, the optimum silicide thickness is around 20nm. As the NMSB and/or tMSB 
are not high enough, WFM has great effect on the device performance. With high enough NMSB 
and tMSB, the device exhibits conventional-like characteristics even if the WFM is 4.6eV. 
Decreasing WFM can improve driving current by reducing the tunneling resistance. 
To summarize, MSB layer doping concentration between 3-5x1019 cm-3, MSB layer 
thickness between 3-5nm, silicide thickness around 20nm, and workfunction lower than 
4.3eV are the most suitable parameters for the MSB MOSFETs.

Thermal Stability of NiSi on Poly-Si Gate 
 
I. Introduction 
Metal silicides have been used in the Si microelectronic industry for more than 20 years. 
Low sheet resistance is an extremely important advantage in device applications where metal 
silicides are used. In complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS integrated circuits, 
metal silicides are usually used as contact materials on source/drain and gate regions in order 
to reduce parasitic resistance and resistance-capacitance time delay. Titanium silicide TiSi2 is 
the first successful metal silicide to have been used. The linewidth effect, due to 
transformation from high resistivity C49 to low resistivity C54 phase, caused TiSi2 to be 
replaced by cobalt silicide CoSi2 at 0.18 µm technology node. However, the high Si volume 
consumption during CoSi2 silicidation is not acceptable below the 90 nm technology node 
because high Si consumption may drastically increase junction leakage current in ultrashallow 
junctions. NiSi is the desirable contact material below the 90 nm node because of its low 
sheet resistance, limited Si consumption, and low silicidation temperature. NiSi has a 
disadvantage of poor thermal stability, including NiSi agglomeration and high resistivity 
phase NiSi2 transformation. 
The formation of stable, uniformly thin silicide film on silicon is a challenge as CMOS 
technology scales down. Gate leakage current, breakdown voltage, and flatband voltage are 
generally sensitive to gate silicide properties. Several methods have been proposed to improve 
the thermal stability of NiSi thin film, for example, capping layers, implanted dopants in 
silicon, or impurities in the metal source [1-4]. Among these methods, NiPt silicide produces 
the most promising results [5-7], but the trade-off is a higher resistivity due to Pt impurity 
doping. 
There are many advantages of Ge implantation technology, including application of 
surface preamorphization implantation, tunable gate work functions, and strain-Si effect. In 
our work, we demonstrate a method of using GeI /Ito improve the thermal stability of NiSi on 
the S/D region and poly-Si gate. Here, we study the high dosage GeI /I influence on poly-Si 
gate. 
 
II. Experiments 
All the process flows for our experiments are summarized in Fig.1. After RCA cleaning,

the BF2+ implant, because F+ can slightly suppress the NiSi agglomeration. In Ge I/I gate 
samples, the Rs of NiSi increased after 750°C for the n+ sample, and after 800°C for the p+ 
sample. The Rs values of NiSi at 750°C on the n+ and p+ Ge I/I gate samples are just 6.2 and 
8.4 Ω/, respectively. We can see the thermal stability has clearly been improved in the Ge 
I/I gate samples. The maximum temperature with no increase in Rs is increased by 100°C. 
The agglomeration of NiSi on poly-Si occurs because both poly-silicon and silicide grow 
vertically through the whole structure, and the silicide on polysilicon layer changes to silicide 
on polysiliconlayer, called “inversion.”[8] The Rs at 750°C for the p+ w/o Ge I/I gate samples 
increase is due to a discontinuous agglomeration silicide layer during inversion. The Rs is 
reduced when the silicide layer is re-established continuously and extends vertically through 
the whole structure. The re-established silicide layer includes the transformation to NiSi2.[9] 
From the results of XRD analysis, as shown in Fig.4a, we can see that NiSi started to 
transform to the NiSi2 phase at 700°C for the p+ w/o Ge I/I gate samples. Although the 
resistivity of NiSi2 is higher than NiSi, the thickness of NiSi2 is greater than that of NiSi. Thus, 
we can see the decrease of Rs on p+ w/o Ge I/I gate sample between 750 and 800°C. In Fig. 4b, 
the transformation of NiSi2 occurs at 800°C for p+ Ge I/I gate samples. The temperature of 
NiSi2 transformation is also increased by Ge I/I by 100°C. 
The plan-view SEM images of NiSi films after various RTA temperatures for 30s on n+ 
gate samples are shown in Fig.5 and on p+ gate samples are shown in Fig.6. As shown in 
Fig.5, we can see the NiSi on n+ w/o Ge I/I gate samples is already agglomerated and 
becomes a rough discontinuous surface at 700°C, but the NiSi on n+ Ge I/I gates amples just 
begins to agglomerate at 750°C. A similar trend is observed on p+ gates amples as shown in 
Fig.6. The NiSi on p+ w/o Ge I/I gate samples has small nucleated pits at 700°C and is then 
agglomerated at 750°C. The Ni Si on p+ Ge I/I gate samples just began to agglomerate at 
850°C. The agglomerated and discontinuous NiSi has higher resistivity, consistent with the 
SEM images in Fig.2. 
The cross-sectional view SEM images of NiSi for n+ and p+ on Ge I/I shown in Fig. 7. In 
Fig. 7, the NiSi on n+ Ge I/I gate samples at 750°C begins to grow along the polysilicon grain 
boundaries and the NiSi/poly-Si interface becomes rough. Finally, the silicide becomes 
laterally discontinuous islands. We often call this condition “mixing,” which commonly 
occurs on silicides at high temperature and causes an increase of Rs.[10] Thus, when the NiSi 
on n+ Ge I/I gate samples shows a serious discontinuous silicide layer at 800°C, the measured 
Rs is increased to 296 Ω/. The behavior of NiSi on p+ Ge I/I gate samples is similar to that 
on n+, the NiSi begin to grow thicker, and the NiSi/poly-Si interface become rough at 800°C.

Thermal Stability of NiSi on Si Substrate 
 
I. Introduction 
Metal silicides have been used in Si microelectronics industry for more than twenty 
years for reducing parasitic resistance and signal propagation delay time. [1-6] Nickel 
monosilicide (NiSi) is now the desirable contact material because of less Si consumption and 
low formation temperature. [7-10] The main issues of the NiSi is its poor thermal stability 
including thin film agglomeration and high-resistivity phase (NiSi2) transformation. Some 
models based on surface/interface energies, grain boundary grooving, and silicide grain size 
have been proposed. [11-13] Since the NiSi phase is not in equilibrium with Si at high 
temperature, the expected reaction of NiSi + Si Æ NiSi2 will occur. Similar to the thin film 
agglomeration, the phase transformation is a nucleation-controlled reaction and depends on 
silicide thickness, dopant impurities, and annealing ramp rate. 
Several methods have been proposed to improve the thermal stability of NiSi film on Si 
substrate; for example, fluorine ion implantation [14, 15], nitrogen ion implantation [16, 17], 
capping layers [18, 19], palladium (Pd) [20] incorporation, and platinum (Pt) [21-24] 
incorporation. Among these methods, Pt incorporated Ni silicide produces the most promising 
results. One of the drawbacks of the Pt-incorporation method is the higher resistivity due to Pt 
doping. Recently, carbon incorporation has been reported to improve thermal stability of NiSi 
[25-27]. However, the solid state solubility of C in Si is very low, improper thermal budget 
after carbon incorporation would produce a large amount of interstitial carbon and results in 
junction leakage. Since the line width and thickness of NiSi scale down continuously, new 
technique to improve its thermal stability is required. 
In the 1980s, Ge ion implantation was reported as a substrate amorphization technique in 
order to eliminate dopant channeling effect. [28-30] Several investigations regarding to the 
effects of Ge pre-amorphization implantation (PAI) process on metal-silicide formation have 
been reported. [31-34] Most of these papers focused on the Ti-silicides and Co-silicides. High 
dose Ge PAI can improve the thermal stability of TiSi2 while low dose (≤1x1015 cm-2) Ge PAI 
does not play any role. [33] On the other hand, the incorporation of Ge results in an increase 
in the nucleation temperature of CoSi2 from about 600°C to about 800°C. [34] The studies of 
the effects of Ge incorporation on Ni-silicides were reported recently. [35-40]  Kittl et al. 
found that the Ge PAI can increase the Ni2Si growth rate at 250°C. [35] Surdeanu et al. 
51 
first annealing step was fixed at 300°C for 60min in vacuum. The GIBS samples were then 
cut into small pieces and received rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N2 ambient at different 
temperatures for 10sec or 30sec. The GIAS (Ge Implantation After Silicidation) samples 
received second annealing at 600°C for 30sec followed by Ge ion implantation at 40KeV to a 
dose of 5x1015 and 1x1016 cm-2. The Rp was about 17nm below the NiSi surface and all of the 
Ge ions were located in the NiSi layer. The GIAS samples were then cut into small pieces and 
received RTA in N2 ambient at different temperatures for different times. Samples without Ge 
ion implantation were also prepared as control samples. The control samples also received the 
2-step annealing with the 1st step at 300°C for 60min and the 2nd step at temperatures higher 
than 500°C for 10sec or 30sec. Table1 lists the process conditions of the blanket GIAS and 
GIBS samples. 
Typical LOCal-Oxidation-of-Si (LOCOS) isolation was employed to fabricate the p-n 
junction samples. Only GIBS method was used to fabricate the p-n junction samples because 
this method results in better thermal stability than the GIAS method. The Ge dose was 1x1016 
cm-2. There was no screen oxide before Ge ion implantation, so the implantation energy was 
reduced to 30KeV to obtain an Rp of about 30nm below the Si surface. This Rp value is 
similar to that of Ge implantation at 50KeV through a 20nm thick screen oxide. To form n+-p 
and p+-n junctions, As and BF2 ions were implanted at 35KeV and 20KeV, respectively, to a 
dose of 5x1015 cm-2. A spike annealing at 1025ºC was performed to activate the dopants and 
annihilate the ion implantation induced defects. The silicidation process was identical to that 
used to fabricate the blanket samples. Table 2 lists the process conditions of the p-n junction 
samples.  
Surface morphology was inspected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Cross-
sectional micro-structure was inspected by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). 
Interface roughness was analyzed by an atomic force microscope (AFM). Phases of Ni-
silicide were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Depth profiles of species were analyzed 
by a Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscope (SIMS). The sheet resistance (Rs) of silicide was 
measured by a four-point probe system. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of junctions 
were measured by a semiconductor parameter analyzer of model Agilent 4156C.

A. Effects of  Ge ion implantation on bulk Si

ion implantation can suppress agglomeration effectively. Figure 5 shows the XRD spectra of 
the GIBS samples with Ge ion implantation at 50KeV to a dose of 1x1016 cm-2 after annealing 
at different temperatures for 30 sec. The NiSi phase remains stable up to 800 ºC even if 
agglomeration has occurred at this temperature. The NiSi2 phase is observed at 850ºC. This 
result indicates that the Ge ion implantation can retard the phase transformation from NiSi to 
NiSi2 and phase transformation occurs behind agglomeration on the samples with high dose 
of Ge ion implantation.  
Another advantage of Ge ion implantation on the NiSi/Si structure is the smooth NiSi/Si 
interface. Figure 6 shows the cross-sectional TEM micrograph of the GIBS sample with Ge 
I/I at 50KeV to a dose of 1x1016 cm-2 after annealing at 750ºC for 30 sec. The NiSi/Si 
interface is quite smooth, which is consistent with the high agglomeration temperature. The 
thickness of the NiSi film is 45nm, which translates to a resistivity of 21 µΩ-cm. This value is 
slightly higher than the bulk value but is much lower than the resistivity of NiSixGe1-x and 
Ni(Pt)Si. Figure 7 shows the SIMS depth profile of Ge in GIBS samples with Ge I/I at 50KeV 
to a dose of 1x1016 cm-2 after annealing at 600°C for 30 sec. Large amount of Ge atoms pile-
up at the NiSi/Si interface. It is suspected that the improved thermal stability and smooth 
interface are correlated to the high concentration of Ge atoms at the interface. 
Table 3 summarizes the agglomeration temperature and the phase-transformation 
temperature of the controlled samples, GIBS samples, and GIAS samples with RTA for 30 
sec. The agglomeration temperatures are determined by SEM inspection and the phase 
transformation temperatures are determined by XRD analysis. In the initial stage of 
agglomeration, the film breaks but is still continuous so that the sheet resistance does not 
increase obviously. Therefore, the agglomeration temperature determined by the SEM 
inspection is lower than that determined by the sheet resistance measurement. The 
mechanisms of improving agglomeration temperature are discussed in the following. It has 
been reported that the ion implantation before silicidation process has two main effects on 
silicide formation: one is pre-amorphization of the substrate and the other is the change of 
surface/interface energy11. The Ge ion implantation produces a uniform amorphous layer 
because ion implantation is a uniform process. The low-temperature first step annealing 
process makes Ni to uniformly react with the amorphous Si layer. The NiSi growth rate on 
amorphous Si region is higher than that on crystalline Si region. Once the NiSi front edge 
reaches the amorphous/crystalline interface, the growth rate is retarded. Therefore, a smooth 
NiSi/Si interface is obtained. High concentration Ge also retards the Ni-silicide growth rate. 
[44] As Ni-silicide grows, Ge atoms are repelled out of the silicide layer and pile-up at the 
55 
has been proposed that the existence of arsenic atoms at the interface between NiSi film and 
Si substrate may change the interface energy and then make the agglomeration occurs easily 
in the NiSi films on n+ Si substrate compare to that of in NiSi films on the other substrates 46. 
The segregated Ge atoms at NiSi grain boundaries still suppress the phase transformation 
from NiSi to NiSi2. On the p+-n junction samples, the agglomeration temperature can be 
raised by either F- or Ge-incorporation. [14, 15, 41] The phase transformation of the sample 
without Ge I/I occurs at 750ºC (XRD data not shown) which is consistent with the published 
data. [14] These results indicate that Ge-incorporation is better than F-incorporation in terms 
of raising the phase transformation temperature. The NiSi thickness of the n+-p junctions with 
Ge ion implantation after annealing at 600°C for 30 sec is about 36 nm, which is slightly 
thinner than that of the blanket sample due to process deviation. The resistivity of the 500°C 
annealed n+-p junction with Ge I/I is 19.8µΩ-cm. To quantify the interface roughness, the 
NiSi film was removed and the Si surface was scanned by AFM. With Ge I/I, the roughness 
decreases from 1.50 nm to 0.85 nm and from 2.23 nm to 1.61 nm on n+ and p+ Si, respectively. 
Figure 9(a) and (b) shows the typical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the n+-p and 
p+-n junctions with Ge ion implantation after 600°C annealing for 30 sec. The forward biased 
current has an ideality factor of around 1.1 on the n+-p junctions. This low value implies that 
most of the ion implantation induced defects near the metallurgic junction have been 
annihilated. The ideality factors of the p+-n junctions with or without Ge I/I are all close to 1.2. 
Therefore, the slightly higher value of the p+-n junctions comparing with that of the n+-p 
junctions might be attributed to the quality of the original Si substrates. 
Figure 10 shows the reverse biased junction leakage current statistics of the n+-p 
junctions after annealing at different temperatures for 30 sec. The p-substrate was grounded 
and +3V was applied on the NiSi film. The leakage current keeps low as the annealing 
temperature is lower than 600°C and increases as the annealing temperature increases to 
650°C. The leakage current of the junctions without Ge implantation is slightly lower than 
that of the junctions with Ge ion implantation as the annealing temperature is 500ºC. As the 
annealing temperature increases to higher than 650ºC, the junctions with Ge ion implantation 
exhibit lower leakage current in comparison with the junctions without Ge ion implantation. 
Figure 11(a) and (b) show the SIMS depth profiles of the 600°C annealed junctions with and 
without Ge ion implantation, respectively. The metallurgic n+-p junction depth is 90 nm 
beneath the NiSi/Si interface. The depth profile of Ni shows a tail toward the metallurgic 
junction in Si owing to the Ni dissolution and diffusion along the ion implantation induced 
defects during silicide formation. The tail in the Ge implanted sample is more apparent than 
57 
medium temperature annealing. This observation is explained by the Ni diffusion and 
dissolution enhancement due to the Ge ion implantation induced extra defects. If these defects 
can be annihilated by suitable thermal annealing techniques such as laser annealing, the 
smooth NiSi/Si interface would have more benefit to ultra-shallow junctions. All of these 
observations suggest the promising nature of Ge ion implantation technique. The highest 
sustainable process temperature of the thinner NiSi may be lower than that observed in this 
work. However, the mechanisms identified in this work for the thermal stability improvement 
could be applied.

Multi-Gate TiN Nanocrystal Non-Volatile Memory 
 
I. Introduction 
    Since D. Kahng and S. M Sze invented the first floating gate non-volatile memory 
(NVM) at Bell Lab. in 1967 [1], various kinds of floating gate memories were proposed and 
the process technology progressed rapidly. Floating gate NVM has the advantages of large 
memory window, high program/erase (P/E) speed, and good reliability for commercial 
applications. In recent years, flash memory becomes one of the fastest growing semiconductor 
technologies and provides hundreds of portable electronic products. However, from 
International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), it forecasts that the scaling 
limitation of the conventional floating gate memories is around 40nm node [2] and some 
challenges would encounter in the near future. The main issue is un-scalable tunneling oxide 
thickness for maintaining acceptable retention performance, therefore, high operation voltage 
are needed, which is predicted around 17V for 40nm node. Increased floating gate coupling 
effect is another issue for the continually closing floating gate memory cell. Therefore, 
NAND technology is projected to migrate to the charge trapping devices with discrete traps 
for charge storage, such as SONOS (Silicon/ Oxide/ Nitride/ Oxide/ Silicon) and nanocrystal 
(NC) structures [2]. 
SONOS type memory which stores charges in the discrete trap node of silicon nitride 
layer exhibits improved retention performance so that the tunneling oxide thickness can be 
reduced to increase the P/E speed and to decrease the operation voltage [3-8]. Besides, some 
advanced SONOS memories such as bandgap engineered SONOS (BE-SONOS) and TANOS 
have demonstrated high P/E speed and attract much attention for applying in the future NVM 
[9-10]. Unfortunately, all SONOS type memories have unwanted migration of stored charges 
in the nitride layer. Nanocrystal memory which uses various materials as the storage node 
such as Si, Ge, HfO2, Pt, Ag, Au, Ni and TiN has been proposed and became another possible 
solution for the future NVM applications [11-26]. Nanocrystal memory may have better 
charge storage ability than SONOS-type memory owing to each nanocrystal is theoretically 
isolate by surrounding dielectric. Therefore, thinner tunneling oxide can be used to improve 
P/E speed and reduced P/E operation voltage without degrading the retention performance. 
Besides, metal nanocrystals have more work function engineering ability and higher density 
of state around Fermi-level than that of semiconductor nanocrystals. Although lots of 
 73
Al2O3 with 1 nm thick were sequentially deposited with 7 periods in a PEALD/ALD clustered 
system and an 15nm or 20nm thick Al2O3 layer was deposited consecutively as the blocking 
dielectric layer in the same ALD system followed by a 150nm thick amorphous Si deposition 
at 545°C as gate electrode. The TiN layers were deposited with TiCl4 as precursor at 350°C in 
the N2/H2 gas ambience and the Al2O3 layers were deposited with Trimethylamine (TMA) 
and H2O as precursors at 300°C. Next, the post deposition annealing (PDA) was performed at 
900°C for 10 sec or 40 sec in nitrogen gas ambience to provide sufficient surface mobility to 
transform the TiN wetting layer into nanocrystals [16].  
In order to estimate the effect of charge trapping layer engineering, a set of devices with 
various TiN wetting layer thicknesses, blocking dielectric thicknesses and different PDA 
times were fabricated. The sample ID and process parameters are listed in Table. 1. The TiN 
wetting layer thickness of sample A (0.7nm) is thicker than that of the other samples (0.5nm). 
Sample B has the longest PDA time (40s) among all samples. Besides, sample D has the 
thinnest blocking dielectric thickness (15nm). The poly-Si gate was doped by BF2+ ion 
implantation at 40KeV to a dose of 5x1015cm-3 followed by activation at 900°C for 20sec in 
nitrogen gas ambience. Before gate definition by e-beam lithography and dry etching, a thick 
TEOS oxide layer was deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) at 
695°C as a hard mask to prevent anti-doping of the poly-Si gate during the n+ source/drain 
(S/D) doping process. The device structure at this process step is shown in Fig. 1(a).  
Next, SiOx (10nm)/SiNx (40nm) stack layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical 
vapor deposition (PECVD) at 300°C and dry-etched to form a composite spacer as shown in 
Fig. 1(b). Then, P31+ ions were implanted into S/D areas at 20 KeV to a dose of 5x1015cm-3 
and a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 900°C for 20sec was performed to activate the S/D 
dopants. Then, the TEOS hard mask and native oxide were selective etched by HF solution 
and a 25nm thick Ni layer was deposited by e-gun evaporation followed by a 2-step self-
aligned Ni-silicide process to obtained better controllability of Ni silicide lateral formation. 
The 1st silicidation step was vacuum annealing at 300°C for 45min and the Ni silicide was 
formed in the Ni2Si phase. After removal un-reacted Ni film by H2SO4:H2O2 (3:1) solution at 
75°C, the 2nd silicidation step was performed at 600°C for 30sec to transform the NiSi2 phase 
to the NiSi phase. The S/D region was converted into fully NiSi structure as shown in Fig. 
1(c). The gate electrode became polycide structure after the silicidation process. 
All measured cells have the same device dimension of W/L=50nm/80nm. The cross-
sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the fabricated tri-gate 
nanocrystal memory (sample B) with the gate length of 80nm and fin width of 50nm are 
 75
moderately longer annealing time helps the formation of TiN nanocrystals. However, total 
TiN mass has much more significant effects on TiN nanocrystals size. Besides, the device 
with thinner blocking dielectric of 15nm (sample D) has almost the same memory window as 
compared with the device with thicker blocking dielectric of 20nm (sample C) which 
indicates that the back-side electron injection is quite negligible at these FN bias conditions. 
The memory windows of sample B-D increased monotonically with the increasing FN 
bias. However, the memory window of sample A increases to the largest value at ±10V and 
then turn down as the P/E bias increases further. The degradation of memory window at 
strong P/E electrical field is usually attributed to the back-side electron injection effect. Fig.7 
shows the P/E speeds of sample A at various bias conditions. The VTH values at both 
programmed state and erased state were affected at high P/E voltage. Because of larger 
hole/electron injection rate from gate electrode to nanocrystals during higher P/E bias 
operations, these injected carriers from gate would recombine with the electrons/holes 
injected from Si channel [28]. Therefore, smaller VTH shifts or so-called saturation 
phenomenon of VTH shift are observed at both program and erase states as the P/E biases 
higher than ±10V for longer pulse width. In the Fig.7, the VTH shift increases with the 
increasing of pulse width and pulse bias as the pulse width is shorter than 0.1sec. However, as 
the pulse width increase to 1sec, the VTH shift decreases at both programmed and erased states 
with the increasing FN bias and the maximum memory window is obtained at ±8V. This 
phenomenon indicates again that as the stored carriers increase to certain value in the 
nanocrystals, the degradation of memory window would occurs. Hence, the memory window 
degradation phenomenon should also occur in sample B-D after much larger P/E bias or much 
longer pulse width is performed. 
 
B. Retention Performance 
Fig.8 show the retention characteristics of sample A and sample B at temperatures T = 
25°C and 85°C. In order to compare the charge loss rate, the sample A, which has the 
maximum memory window, was programmed and erased at ±10V for 0.01 sec to reach 
similar programmed state and erased state of sample B which was programmed and erased at 
±12V for 0.1 sec. In this case, the memory window for both samples are about 1.95V, which 
is close to the maximum memory window of sample B. It can be observed that sample A has 
less charge loss rate than sample B either at T = 25°C or T = 85°C  because the nanocrystal 
size of sample A (~3nm) is larger than that of sample B (~1-2nm). The 3nm nanocrystal is 
still too tiny to be affected by the Coulomb repulsive force and quantum confinement effect. 
 77
nanocrystal may be not identical. For example, the nanocrystals located near the top corner of 
the active layer, the more charges can be injected due to stronger electric field. This 
phenomenon may also result in the deterioration of the sub-threshold swing. 
Gate disturbance happens when the neighboring cells, which share the same word line, 
are biased by programming or erasing pulse. Therefore, the gate disturbance characteristics of 
sample A under four kinds of situations for 1000 sec are shown in Fig.10. It can be observed 
that after stress at VG= ±10V for 103sec, the device at erase state has negligible VTH shift 
which is owing to the decreased electric field in the multi-gate structure on SOI wafer. In the 
multi-gate structure, the body, source and drain terminals potential are all floating. Therefore, 
we suspect that the electric field between the trapping nodes and Si body is reduced to 
suppress unwanted carrier migration or charge loss.  However, after VG= ±10V for 103sec 
stressing at programmed state, the device with erased bias has more VTH shift than that with 
programmed bias because the repulsive force and floating body can blockade the extra 
injected electrons at programmed state but some stored electrons would be de-trapped by 
higher negative erased voltage. It should be noted that these disturbance properties are both 
saturated after several tens second and would not induce critical issue. Fig. 11 shows the read 
disturbance of sample A at erase state for 103sec stressing bias. Very small variation can be 
observed which indicates that insignificant carrier migrations, injection or de-trapping during 
read operations. 
 
VI. Conclusions 
In this work, n-channel tri-gate metal nanocrystal memory using TiN nanocrystals as the 
discrete storage nodes and high-k blocking dielectric layer and p+ poly-Si gate was successful 
fabricated. The effects of charge trapping layer thickness and post deposition annealing time 
are investigated. It is observed that the memory window is dominated by the size of 
nanocrystal. Although longer annealing time could help the growth of TiN nanocrystals and 
slightly enhance the memory window, adequately mass is the key factor to form larger TiN 
nanocrystals and obtain larger memory window. The phenomenon of turn-down memory 
window as the FN bias increases is observed and explained by stronger electric field in the 
blocking dielectric layer. 
In addition, the charge loss rates of samples with different nanocrystal sizes are similar 
as the devices are programmed and erased to the maximum initial memory window. The 
retention performance was mainly affected by the Coulomb repulsive force but not quantum 
confinement effect. This observation implies that the quantum confinement effect in the metal

Nanowires as Charge Storage Material 
 
I. Introduction 
To further scales down the flash-type memories, NAND technology is predicted to migrate 
to charge trapping devices with discrete traps storage. NC memory is one of the possible 
solutions for the future NVMs [1-3]. However, it is reported that as the NC size becomes 
smaller than 5nm, the Coulomb blockade effect and the quantum confinement effect will 
degrade the programming and retention performance [4]. On the other hand, the number of 
NCs in one cell becomes fewer and fewer as the cell size continuously scales down so that the 
performance fluctuation due to NC number variation becomes worse and worse. 
Using NW to replace NC has been proposed recently [5, 6]. Comparing to NC, NW has 
higher density of states and weaker quantum confinement effect. In this work, the effects of 
NW density, diameter, and distribution on the programming speed, memory window, and 
channel controllability are studied by 3-dimensional simulation. 
 
II. Device Structure 
Sentaurus-TCAD tool was used in this work [7]. The schematic structure of the multi-gate 
silicon-on-insulator memory cell with five NWs is shown in Fig.1. The channel region is 
p-type with a doping concentration of 1x1015 cm-3. The thickness is 40nm and the width is 
30nm. The tunneling SiO2 layer and blocking SiO2 layer is 3nm and 14nm thick, respectively. 
The gate electrode is n+ poly-Si with work function of 4.05eV. The physical gate length is 
50nm. The source/drain concentration is 1x1020 cm-3 and the gate-to-source/drain overlap is 5 
nm at each side. The diameter of NWs is 3 nm in most case, which is a reasonable value for 
metallic CNTs or Si NWs. The memory cell may have 1, 3, or 5 NWs. The NWs are 
numbered as NW1, NW2, NW3, NW4, and NW5 from drain side to source side. For the cell 
with 3 NWs, the NW2 and NW4 are absent. For the cell with 1 NW, only the NW3 at channel 
center exists. The trapping level of the NW is assumed to be 4.05eV. Complete bandgap 
narrowing model, recombination model, quantum mechanics model, and mobility model are 
all considered. FN tunneling is the main carrier injection mechanism in the simulation.
