Abstract 
This research concerns the congestion control problem for large-scale wired and 
wireless networks. A mathematical model describing for date transmission in large- scale 
network is developed. A time-delay compensation strategy is derived. A controller 
combined with the time-delay compensator is established to solve the congestion control 
problem. Finally, the proposed approach is fully verified using the network simulator 
version 2 (NS2).

The details of basic model concerned here are 
as shown in Fig. 3, in which iw , iq , ip , and 
iR denote the averaging TCP window size, 
averaging queue size, dropping probability of 
RED,  and averaging round-trip time for node i , 
respectively; jw  , jq , jp , and jR  represent, 
respectively, the averaging window size, 
averaging queue size, dropping probability for 
RED, and averaging round-trip time for node j ; 
C  is the capacity and taken as the output flow of 
node j ; parameters iγ and jγ  represent the 
probability for packet transmission failed of node 
i  and node j , respectively. For wired networks, 
the values set for iγ and jγ  are all zero.

C. Extension of Control Method for 
Large-Scale Network 
The block diagram for applying our proposed 
control strategy in large-scale networks having N 
routers is sequentially introduced in Fig. 7 which 
the block diagram for node i is as the one in Fig. 6. 
It is defined that 1 ~ 1i N= − . 
The procedure for applying our proposed 
strategy in large-scale networks can be 
summarized in four steps: 
1. The controller of the sink (node N ) should 
be designed first with the strategy proposed 
for TCP2.

simulation study 
In Fig. 10, a significant damping behavior is 
found at 80s, which is due to the fact that the 
property of wireless network wasn’t accurately 
modelled in the system description. That is, nodes 
within the broadcasting range compete for the 
same wireless channel, and only one transmission 
is allowed at the same time.  
Experimental results for the second simulation 
study are shown as in Fig. 11 in which the line 
“qlen1_tcp1_original.tr” denotes the variation of 
queue size for TCP1 applying DropTail; the line 
“qlen1_tcp1.tr” represents the one for TCP1 using 
our controller; the line “qlen2_tcp2_original.tr” is 
the variation of queue length for TCP2 using 
DropTail; the line “qlen2_tcp2.tr” corresponds to  
the one for TCP2 applying the controller. 
( )a ( )b  
Fig. 11. Results for the second simulation study 
Although the damping dynamics exists in our 
simulation study, the queue length of the wireless 
network is more stable and less than that based on 
the DropTail protocol. Hence, it can be concluded 
that our proposed controller still works under the 
extreme cases. For the second simulation study, it 
is feasible that TCP2 exhibits a more serious 
congestion in queues than TCP1 because the 
closer the node is with the sink node, the more 
congestion it has. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
This research has considered the congestion 
control problem in large-scale wired and wireless 
networks. A basic model for large scale network 
is developed. Instead of taking time delay as a 
constraint in control design, the controller 
combined with the time-delay compensator is 
proposed to accomplish congestion control and 
fully verified using NS2. The congestion is thus 
relaxed via our method. There are still problems 
to be solved, such as the property of single 
connection of wireless networks should be 
appropriately modelled and sensitivity to the 
variation of queue length of the controller should 
also be enhanced.

Abstract—This paper concerns the congestion control problem 
for large-scale wired networks. A mathematical model for large-
scale wired networks is developed. A time-delay compensation 
strategy is derived to deal with the time delay problem. While 
applying the time-delay compensator, a controller is established 
to accomplish the congestion control. This approach is fully 
verified by the use of network simulator NS2.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, network control has become increasingly 
popular. One of the problems related to network control is the 
congestion control problem. It is quite often that delays 
happen in Internet because of the congestion of data 
transmission. The communication delay deteriorates the 
system performance and may sometime destroy the whole 
system stability. Thus, how to develop an efficient congestion 
control strategy for the networked system is highly required. 
Several approaches have been proposed in the literature 
building math models to reasonably describe the dynamic 
behavior of the network under transmission control protocol 
(TCP). In which, the most popular one is the fluid-based 
model proposed in [1], which modeled the behavior of TCP by 
applying random early detection (RED) on queue management. 
An application of this model was proposed in [2] in which a 
PID controller was designed for a local wired network. Others 
were proposed in [3-5], and stability analysis has been 
conducted based on the gain margin and phase margin. 
However, all of these researches considered the effect of time 
delay as a constraint imposed on the gain and phase margins 
for stability. 
In large-scale network systems, the constraints induced by 
time delay may bring excessive difficulties in control design. 
If the time delay can be appropriately compensated, then the 
task of the subsequent network control design would be 
accordingly easier. Our research is motivated mainly by the 
observation. In this paper, an extension of the techniques 
depicted in [8-10] is developed. This is the first attempt of 
time-delay compensation for the congestion control problem 
for large-scale network systems so far. This approach is 
verified and demonstrated using the network simulator (NS2). 
Extensive soft experiments confirm applicability of the 
proposed methodology. 
The paper is summarized as follows. The problem statement 
is denoted in section II. A basic model for large-scale network 
is derived in section III. The compensating strategy for time 
delay is proposed in section IV. The controller design is done 
in section V. Finally, the simulation study and conclusion 
come, respectively, in section VI and VII. 
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The objective here is to design a controller combined with 
RED to achieve stability for the whole network. Because the 
behavior of the present node is influenced by the next one, the 
large-scale wired network with N nodes can be taken as a 
combination for the model illustrated as in Fig. 1. In this 
figure, each node represents a router. Every two adjacent 
nodes form a TCP loop. For example, the k -th and ( )1k − -th 
( [ ]1,k N∈  ) nodes as shown in Fig. 1 form a TCP loop. There 
are 1N −  TCP loops in this large-scale network. The problem 
is thus simplified as follows: how do we design a network 
controller combined with RED for the active queue 
management (AQM) of the system which ensures loop 
stability.  
III. MODELING OF LARGE-SCALE WIRED NETWORK 
Behaviors of the two adjacent nodes, such as node i  and 
node j , are considered simultaneously. There are some 
variables defined first, iw , iq , ip , and iR  denote, 
respectively, the averaging TCP window size, averaging queue 
size, dropping probability of RED, and averaging round-trip 
time for node i ; jw  , jq , jp , and jR  represent, respectively,

IV. TIME-DELAY COMPENSATION STRATEGY 
A. Extended Network Disturbance ( END ) 
A design strategy for time-delay compensation has been 
proposed in [6-8]. However, only the case of system with 
input delay was considered. The concept of extended network 
disturbance for systems with input and state delays is 
developed in the follows. An example for systems with 
delayed input and state is shown as in Fig. 2(a). The property 
of delayed input and state can be substituted by adding an 
additional disturbance END which is user-defined in systems. 
For example, the END for systems in Fig. 2(a) is 
( ) ( )2 2 Tsu yG u yG e−+ − + . Our time-delay compensation is 
established using END.

As a result, AX  will converge to a constant, and jpΔ will 
converge to zero when time approaches to infinity. That is, 
jqΔ will approach to a constant.

When time is approaching to infinity, 1ˆx converges to zero and 
it is obtained that 2 22ˆ 0V ac x≤ − ≤ . Therefore, 2X  would be 
stable in the sense of Lyapunov. It will converge to a constant
