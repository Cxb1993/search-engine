Producer Responsibility (EPR), requesting the product 
manufacturer have to take the responsibility on 
recycling and final disposal by enforcing related 
laws. In this study, we try to investigate the 
variation of different recycling policies on 
different recycling situations. We simulate the 
different system behaviors of different recycling 
policies, observe the cost effectiveness trends, 
collect and analyze the system output by changing 
different recycle situations, and finally evaluate 
the feasibility of these policies through the 
results. 
After the experiments, we find that the cost 
effectiveness of three different recycle policies 
would change in different situations. The Producer 
Responsibility Organizations combine with deposit 
system shows the most stable cost effectiveness 
trend； it won’t change obviously when recycle rate 
increase. It appears to be the most feasible and 
beneficial policy in Taiwan.

我國廢乾電池回收體系效益分析 
Analyzing Recycling Performance of Waste Dry Battery in Taiwan 
 
摘要 
隨著電機電子設備生命週期的縮短，汰舊換新的速度也不斷加快。在電機電
子設備中，電池是重要的功能性零組件，無論是一次電池或是二次電池(充電電
池)必將隨著使用產品之汰換或壽命終止而遭到丟棄。目前市售的乾電池仍有部
分含有對環境有害之汞、鉛與鎳等重金屬，若無法妥善回收處理而流入環境中，
不僅會對生物體與環境造成傷害，最終也會危害到人體。我國的廢乾電池回收是
由回收管理基金管理委員會（基管會）負責管理，相關責任業者僅須支付回收清
除處理費。現在已有許多國家採納延伸生產者責任的概念，將其融入法規，規範
生產者必須負起產品回收及最終處置之責任，實為現今資源回收主要遵循之精神
及方向。 
本研究目的在探討不同回收制度之回收系統在不同回收情境下之變化。在本
研究所假設的情境下，觀察其成本效益之趨勢。本研究利用系統模擬方法模擬不
同回收政策之系統行為，透過改變不同的回收情境來收集並分析各系統之輸出資
料，藉此評估廢乾電池回收政策之可行性及效益。 
本研究選出三種不同回收政策，並且針對該政策可能呈現之回收系統進行模
擬實驗。在假設情境下，發現三個不同的回收系統之成本效益，在不同回收情境
改變之下而各有不同的改變趨勢。以實行 Producer Responsibility Organizations
（PRO）組織併同押金制度之系統成本效益變動最為穩定與可行。不同於另外兩
個系統，PRO 組織併同實施押金制度能夠表現出較相對穩定之成本效益趨勢，
不會因為回收率之提升而有明顯變動。

ABSTRACT 
 
Due to shorter product life cycle, there will be more and more waste electrical 
and electronic equipment (EEE). In EEE, battery is an important functional component. 
It will be discarded with the waste of EEE, either first-grade (dry) batteries or 
second-grade (rechargeable) batteries. There are batteries nowadays still contain heavy 
metal, such as mercury, lead and nickel. It will hurt the environment and human beings 
if they are not properly disposed of and well processed. 
In Taiwan, the waste dry battery recycling was managed by Recycling Fund 
Management Board. Producers only have to pay advantage disposal fees (ADFs). 
Many countries have adopted the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), 
requesting the product manufacturer have to take the responsibility on recycling and 
final disposal by enforcing related laws. In this study, we try to investigate the 
variation of different recycling policies on different recycling situations. We simulate 
the different system behaviors of different recycling policies, observe the cost 
effectiveness trends, collect and analyze the system output by changing different 
3 
Many considerations are to be handled in designing an operational simulation 
system since the real world conditions are relatively complicated. It is necessary to 
carefully process parameters and settings, according to a set of assumptions. The main 
purpose of this research is to analyze the recycling effectiveness of waste dry battery. 
The methodology is divided into two steps. First, construct the system model and 
analyze the recycling system’s behavior through simulation. Second, collect the 
system output and evaluate the cost effectiveness of different recycle policies. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. First, the relevant literature is 
reviewed in section 2. The model construction is presented in section 3. Section 4 then 
illustrates situations of different recycle policies. Finally, section 5 depicts conclusions 
and limitations. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1 Extended Producer Responsibility 
 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is defined by Thomas Lindhqvist (2000) 
as follows:  
 
An environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a 
decreased total environmental impact from a product, by making the 
manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life cycle of the product 
and especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal of the product. 
 
Lindhqvist (2000) separated EPR’s responsibility into four fields: economic 
responsibility, liability, physical responsibility and informative responsibility. Figure 1 
shows the ERP responsibility.

2.2 Recycle system in Taiwan 
 
In Taiwan, the waste dry battery recycling was managed by Recycling Fund 
Management Board. Producers only have to pay advance disposal fee (ADFs) to bear 
the relevant recycle expense. Academics in Taiwan point out the extant problems that 
happened in Recycling Fund Management Board as follows (Chiou, 2010): 
1. Being an executor and supervisor, how to punish itself when the objective can’t be 
reach? 
2. Under the policy of zero waste, the amount of recycled items will increase. 
3. Increase of audit cost for false producers’ payment. 
4. Too many workforce and administrative costs on auditing.

2. data collection and analysis.

4. model verification and validation. 
 
3.2.1 System description 
Before building the model, we give a comprehensive description of the system. 
We take the waste dry battery recycle system in Taiwan as the basis, build up the 
recycle systems for three policies we want to pinpoint. We further discuss two 
dimensions of problems. One is the consumer’s purchase behavior. According to 
different policies, we develop different consumer purchase groups. The other one is 
cost effectiveness analysis. 
 
3.2.2 Date collection and analysis 
Running these simulation models needs to configure parameters to mimic the 
real world system. There are two ways to collect data: one is through the literature, 
and the other is through expert interviews. Data that cannot be obtained by the 
above-mentioned ways are set by reasonable assumptions. 
The parameters and policy concept of this research was obtained from a series of 
projects from Environment Protection Association (EPA) in Taiwan. These data are 
collected and calculated by experts in related fields. Using practical data can reduce 
the deviation during simulating and analyzing. 
 
3.2.3 Building simulation model 
We use eM-Plant 8.1, a simulation software package, to build up the simulation 
model. There are three models that we are going to discuss: 1) existing recycling 
system in Taiwan, 2) deposit system, and 3) producer responsibility organization 
(PRO) combine with deposit system. Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate these models.

behavior of members in the system by microcosmic way, it will be difficult to execute 
and the information we have to collect will be huge. Thus, we firstly focus on how 
different recycling rate and different consumer proportion and different recycle 
system affect the system’s cost effectiveness. Hence, we show these members as a 
node in the system, observing how batteries shift in system and number of batteries 
stay in consumer groups. 
Before simulation experiments, we have to make some explaination and 
assumptions: 
1. The dry battery in this research refers to zinc battery and non-button type 
alkaline manganese battery. 
2. Although the processers in Taiwan have controlled the recovery process of 
second-grade batteries, it still does not work. Thus, we only discuss the 
recovery process of first-grade battery. 
3. Suppose the inventory and recovery volume can fulfill the system’s input. 
4. Executing time is eight hours a day, five days a week, 51 weeks a year; 
simulate for totally three years. 
5. The mean and standard deviation was accordingly set to the sales volume in 
Taiwan from 2002 to 2008. 
6. The simulation time will be too long if use the original sale volume. Thus, 
we scale down the simulation model 300 times. 
7. The consumers’ behavior is assumed to be the same in different policies. 
8. The common parameters are set the same for three policies. 
9. The system scope is starting from producers, ending at domestic processers. 
 
4.1.1 Policy 1: Existing recycle system in Taiwan 
In this policy, producers and importers release new batteries to market. 
Consumers will retain 25% batteries as inventory after they buy new batteries from 
market. The used batteries will send to recycle spots, then collected by recyclers, and 
resell to domestic processers for recycling. After classifying, crushing, sieving and 
magnetic separation, waste dry batteries will be transformed into many kinds of 
resource, such as iron, zinc and manganese dioxide. 
Producers and importers have to pay ADFs to Recycling Fund Management 
Board, according to sales volume, by a tax rate of 23.50 NT dollars per kilogram. The 
Recycling Fund Management Board then pay subsidy to processers by the price of 
43.50 NT dollars per kilogram. Recyclers sell the collected waste dry batteries to 
domestic processers by the price of 28.00 NT dollars per kilogram. After recycling 
process, processers sell these resources by the price of 9.25 NT dollars per kilogram 
of iron; 14.50 NT dollars per kilogram of sieving; and 3.00 NT dollars per kilogram of 
magnetic separation. Besides, importers import dry batteries by the price of 104.14 
NT dollars per kilogram and take 43% of total outlay as total income. Market sell new 
dry batteries by the price of 24.25 NT dollars per battery, and take 30% of revenue as 
total income. Finally, the Recycling Fund Management Board will expend 2473498 
NT dollars per year as audit cost. Figure 6 shows the cash flow diagram of policy 1. 
Recyclers collect waste dry batteries five days a week, and then resell these 
waste dry batteries to domestic processer. Recyclers take 68% of revenue as outlay, 
32% as income. In this model, we are going to discuss four levels of recycle rate, 
totally execute four simulation experiments.

4.2 Building simulation models 
 
4.2.1 Model description 
We apply eM-Plant 8.1 to build up models and execute simulation experiments 
after policy explanations and establishing assumptions. Figure 9 displays the time 
setting of new batteries’ production. 
 
 
Figure 9. Time setting of new batteries’ production 
 
The mean and standard deviation is accordingly set to the sales volume in 
Taiwan from 2002 to 2008. Before new batteries entered market, the using time 
should be set. Figure 10 is a programming example for setting up using time.

Figure 13 is the simulation model of policy 2. In this policy, consumers are 
separated into two groups: Buy with battery and Buy without battery, to mimic the 
implementation of deposit system. In this simulation model, we change recycle rate 
from 15% to 60%, and change consumer proportion by the flow controller. Totally 
four experiments were executed. Table 2 describes the simulation sequences of policy

Figure 14 shows the simulation model of policy 3. Consumers are separated into 
three groups: Buy with battery, Buy without battery and Buy platform battery. 
Recyclers are separated into two groups: Self-recycler system and Platform-recycling 
system. In this model, we change recycle rate from 15% to 60%, and change the 
consumer proportion by the flow controller. Totally 16 experiments were executed.

二、與會心得 
I was presented as poster. However, I attended some sessions in oral. I 
came across some topics are really impressive to me. In retrospect, the 
paper presented by Dr. Perng, Chyuan was quite interesting. Dr. Perng is an 
active presenter too. However, the main author (principal investigator) was 
not showed up to this session and talked about their work in depth.  
I came across that some presenters brought their family to the 
conference. Some of them are even junior high school students. It is nice to 
those teenagers to possess this kind of experience. 
I appreciated the support from NSC and would like to continue related 
research as there are chances. 
 
一、建議 
The schedule was very nice but somehow tight. Extending one or two 
days of the itinerary would be more adequate. 
The conference drew very few western participants. It is a very great 
opportunity to show our competitive advantage and to spread our influence 
in innovation and management to western world.

1. Introduction 
Since the development of internet technology in 1990, internet shifts the way of 
working, living and communication for people. Utilization of Internet technology has 
been already integrated into daily lives by people. Among these technologies, online 
shopping is one of the fastest developing technologies. It is not limited to space and 
territory, allows consumers to purchase goods they require at any time and at any 
place. Consumers can easily find product information through internet. Via online 
shopping, traffic expense spent in commuting between stores and time in comparing 
prices will be lessened. 
Even though online transaction is convenient, internet is relatively anonymous. 
To avoid being deceived by swindlers for both store operators and members in the 
process of online transaction, a large amount of E-commerce websites set up 
membership system. This is to identify authenticity of members by utilizing identity 
verification mechanism, so as to guarantee security in the process of online 
transaction. Therefore, E-commerce member database often includes numerous 
member data, such as personal profile and transaction detail. With the rapid 
development of information technology, enterprises can easily store customer 
transaction record (Laudon & Laudon, 2000).  
To investigate customer behaviors, data mining is used to find useful information 
and knowledge from numerous data, which is currently widely applied into many 
fields (Han & Kamber, 2006). Data mining techniques are effectively used in product 
marketing, sale and customer service, regarded as one of important tools for 
increasing operation advantages and competitive force of enterprises (Berry & Linoff, 
2004; Hui & Jha, 2000). If data is effectively analyzed by enterprises with the help of 
data classification and prediction trend, the managers will effectively make decision 
through established data model. Among data mining algorithms, decision tree is a 
relatively simple method of classifying data. Many scholars developed and 
investigated decision tree classification models in member classification mechanism 
(Cheng and Duo, 2002; Zhen and Ming, 2005; Cheng, 2005). 
E-commerce websites generally own a large amount of member data. However, 
most of the operators do not analyze customer behavior via the transaction database. 
If transaction records of members are effectively utilized, transaction behaviors of 
consumers are deeply analyzed, such as to dig out product attributes preferred by 
consumers, then exclusive marketing strategies can be designed for members with 
different attributes; customized and differential product service most closely to 
members can be provided. A better website or online service thus can be achieved. 
This study mainly aims on developing a member classification model for 
E-commerce websites in Taiwan by using C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The proposed 
models will assist operators of E-commerce websites to automatically classify 
members, and more effectively find core customer groups, so as to stipulate marketing 
strategies. 
The specific objectives of this study are as follows: (1) Exploring the current 
member management mechanism and development of e-commerce in Taiwan. (2) 
Using decision tree to propose an automatic member classification model for 
e-commerce service providers in Taiwan. (3) Investigating the classification accuracy 
of the proposed model. 
This study discusses and organizes current status and member mechanism of 
E-commerce in Taiwan through literature review. Questionnaire is utilized to collect 
and mimic real member database in E-commerce websites as data source of decision 
tree classification, and thereafter construct automatic member classification models. A 
10 
When decision tree classification is constructed, corresponding decision rules 
will be produced to provide decision makers. A simple expression for making decision 
is presented as “IF…THEN…” The IF-THEN rule is aimed to reduce complexity of 
judging data categories (Michie, 1994). Decision tree classification could easily 
change into rules. The corresponding rules could be transferred by integrating all 
decisions after judgment conditions of all branches upon pass-by of routes are 
recorded from branches to leaf nodes beginning from the root node. 
 
3. Model Construction and Discussion 
3.1 Data source and preparation 
This study is to establish automatic member classification models on 
E-commerce websites by using decision tree classification. It is expected that the 
much simpler and accurate model in data classification is better. There are totally 23 
data attributes organized in this study. If each attribute is used as one node, the 
decision tree will be excessively heavy, and important attribute classification points 
are unable to be found, leading to a less useful classification model. Trimming on 
decision tree by removing invalid data attributes is necessary. 
Due to practical unavailability limitation of some important attributes of 
customer behavior, we design a questionnaire to collect online shopping behavior data. 
Questionnaire content designed in this study is divided into two parts. First part is 
online shopping behavior of interviewees on E-commerce websites, and behavior 
information relating to transaction, including shopping experience, online time, 
shopping content, etc. Second part is demographic variables, such as the profile 
information of an interviewee. 
Before data mining algorithm is implemented, the preliminary work is to prepare 
and organize data. The impurity among data is cleaned through this step. However, 
the classification algorithm based on decision tree is unable to use range values, such 
as personal income. Therefore, it is divided into nominal scale variables. For instance, 
five types of income are formed. All data must go through the phase of 
pre-processing. 
3.2 Distribution and modification to pretest questionnaire 
Samples in this study are mainly consumers who have experience of using 
internet. An online questionnaire containing two major question items is created and 
uploaded on a server for internet visitors to download and respond. Removing three 
invalid questionnaires, totally 143 valid ones are collected. 
3.3 Constructing classification models 
This study is mainly purposed to assist E-commerce websites to effectively 
classify members, find characteristics of members in E-commerce websites, and 
provide reference to E-commerce operators to define target members upon stipulation 
of marketing strategies. We adopts C4.5 decision tree classification algorithm, and 
utilizes Weka software as computational tools for constructing classification models. 
Decision tree classification models are constructed through model training and testing. 
Totally 143 data sets are calculated by Weka. Node deduction process is also 
performed. Weka randomly samples 70% of data, and training models are tuned to 
form a subtle tree. The rest 30% of data is then used to obtained correct rates. The 
procedures are as follows. 
Firstly, attributes that members mainly browse shopping websites in member 
database are picked. When 23 data attributes are input into classification system, we 
primarily obtained a decision tree illustrated in Figure 1 
12 
Rule 
1 
Average hours for browsing shopping websites every day > 15 minutes AND average times for 
browsing shopping websites every day > 5 times AND amount for online shopping each time > 
250 $NTD AND have experience of using shopping shops. THEN members who browse 
shopping websites online.  
Rule 
2 
Average hours for browsing shopping websites every day > 15 minutes AND average times for 
browsing shopping websites every day > 5 times AND amount for online shopping each time > 
250 $NTD AND have no experience of using shopping shops AND average times of surfing 
internet every day <= 5 times. THEN members who browse shopping websites online.  
 
Attribute that clothes and cosmetic products are purchased online is picked out. 
The system produced 12 rules and 24 subtrees. We figure out that even though 
member automatic classification model is constructed on the basis of C4.5 algorithm, 
whereas because the classification rules and subtrees are too much, even though 
correct rate reaches as highly as 94.4%. If the number of members increases, 
calculation time spent in constructing member automatic classification model for 
E-commerce and complexity of decision rules will be enhanced. To solve this problem, 
we cancelled attributes of unnecessary data based on trimming method of decision 
tree classification. Firstly, three data attributes for member online hours are eliminated, 
including online hours at daytime, online hours in the evening and online hours in the 
morning. Then, decision tree classification is continuously constructed on the basis of 
rest 20 data attributes, as well as trimmed based on these rules. After trimming 
process, a final decision tree with eight important data attributes taken as nodes is 
established, including shopping experience, sex, use online payment mechanism, with 
bad payment record, hours of browsing shopping websites, times of browsing 
websites, online times, and personal income. 
An eight-level classification model is found from decision tree classification 
constructed. The correct rate is 88.8%, a decrement of 5.6% from untrimmed model. 
The trimmed model conforms to requirements of being simple while having 
acceptable high correct rate. Based on the decision tree classification, three decision 
rules in member automatic classification model for people who purchase clothes and 
cosmetic products online are established, shown in Table 3. Based on this principle, 
E-commerce websites could rapidly find members who have the attribute of mainly 
purchasing clothes and cosmetic products online, and quickly specify potential 
marketing strategies according to relevant attributes. 
 
Table 3. Decision rules of member automatic classification model for people who 
purchase clothes and cosmetic products online 
Rule 
1 
Members who have experience of online shopping, AND female, THEN mainly purchase 
clothes and cosmetic products. 
Rule 
2  
Members who have experience of online shopping, AND male; AND not using online payment 
mechanism; AND no bad payment record; AND time spent in browsing shopping websites 
every day <= 90 minutes; AND times of browsing shopping websites every day > 0.5; THEN 
mainly purchase clothes and cosmetic products. 
Rule 
3  
Members who have experience of online shopping, AND male; AND not using online payment 
mechanism; AND without bad payment record; AND time spent in browsing shopping websites 
every day <= 90 minutes; AND times of browsing shopping websites every day > 0.5; AND 
online times every day <= 3 times; AND personal income > 25000 NTD; THEN mainly 
purchase clothes and cosmetic product.  
 
Additionally if manufacturers want to seek members who mainly purchase 3C, 
household appliance and game products in online shopping, they could produce 
decision tree classification by using the forgoing rules. However, because the 
classification rules of the untrimmed model are too much, the subtrees produced are 
14 
1  products in online shopping; AND use online payment mechanism; AND average online hours 
every day <= 1.5 hours; THEN mainly purchase books and foods.   
Rule 
2  
Members who have experience of online shopping; AND mainly purchase clothes and cosmetic 
products in online shopping; AND use online payment mechanism; AND average online hours 
every day > 1.5 hours; AND average times of browsing shopping websites > 5 times; THEN 
mainly purchase books and foods.   
Rule 
3  
Members who have experience of online shopping; AND don’t purchase clothes and cosmetic 
products in online shopping; AND online period is not in the morning (00:00 ~ 8:00); AND 
online activity is not shopping; THEN mainly purchase books and foods. 
Rule 
4  
Members who have experience of online shopping; AND don’t purchase clothes and cosmetic 
products in online shopping; AND online period is not in the morning (12:00 - 8:00); AND 
online activity is shopping; AND times of browsing shopping websites <= 5 times; THEN 
mainly purchase books and foods.  
 
4. Concluding Remarks 
To locate potential customer in E-commerce operation is of importance. The 
competitive advantage will be increased if E-commerce websites are able to better 
analyze member database, such as transaction time of members and browsing time, 
find core customer groups, specify different marketing manner based on difference 
customer attributes, and deliver electronic product catalogue to customers according 
to their preferences, provide reference for their purchase. We tried to establish 
member automatic classification models through building decision trees from member 
database. The C4.5 algorithm of decision tree classification is employed and the 
trimming process is performed. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Automatic 
member classification models are constructed by using decision tree classification. (2) 
Important attributes of classifying E-commerce websites members are formed by 
using decision tree classification. (3) Decision tree classification models are trimmed 
for better application and operation, while accuracy of model classification is 
compensated. 
Through application of classification model, website members can be properly 
classified. It is understood that automatic classification model will increase 
competitive advantage of E-commerce websites, thus website operators could find 
core members with assistance of classification models, and provide most suitable 
product and/or service at most suitable time to customers. This will further promote 
their loyalty and satisfaction to service providers, and eventually create a win-win 
phenomenon between E-commerce website operators and their members.
