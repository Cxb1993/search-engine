Abstract 
A systematic approach to achieving high 
quality hexagonal microlens array fabrication 
using a thermal reflow process with 
incomplete developing technique is developed 
in this study. The experimental results proved 
that a hexagonal microlens array with a 
maximum 100% fill factor could be 
successfully produced. In this experiment, the 
Taguchi method was used first to perform an 
efficient experimental design and analyze the 
robustness of the microlens array. Several 
parameters affect microlens array uniformity; 
the hexagonal column diagonal, spin coating 
revolution speed, exposure time, developing 
time, and reflow temperature. It is very 
important to control these parameters to 
decrease the sensitivity to noise. However, 
this method could not avoid the interaction 
between the design factors and nonlinear 
approach that affect the parameter 
optimization results. Therefore an artificial 
neural network (ANN) was used to minimize 
the variation and make the microlens array 
less sensitive to variations. The 18L  
orthogonal array was used as the learning data 
for the ANN to construct an artificial neural 
network model. The design and development 
time for neural networks can be reduced 
tremendously. This technique greatly reduced 
the number of experiments and provided 
superior performance results with significant 
interaction effects and nonlinear variations. 
The artificial neural network model accurately 
predicted the responses for the parameter 
combinations with non-discrete levels. The 
major objective in using this robust design is 
to reduce the variations in microlens array 
focal length, allowing improved focus and 
enhanced illumination brightness

1 Introduction 
Microlens arrays have been widely used 
in engineering applications during the past 
few years. The integrated microlens array is a 
very important part in CCDs, auto-focus 
modules, copiers and optical fiber 
interconnects.1,2 The light sources must be 
made brighter and longer lasting while 
reducing the device power consumption, size 
and weight. The major microlens array 
application enhances the illumination 
brightness and simplifies light-guide module 
construction. In a laptop display, a 25% 
LIGA process. 
Considering the deviations in design 
variables in the early design stages is a recent 
trend in quality engineering. Microlens array 
quality could be accomplished at low cost and 
high performance by reducing the variation. 
The variations due to the raw material, 
manufacturing process parameters and 
operation conditions would limit microlens 
array applications. This study introduced the 
parameter design concept which improves the 
quality of a microlens array whose 
manufacturing process involves significant 
variability. A systematic approach to 
achieving high quality gapless microlens array 
fabrication using the thermal reflow and 
caulking processes is developed. The two 
major objectives of this work are: 1) to 
minimize the performance variability in the 
focal lengths for the microlens array after the 
thermal reflow process; 2) to improve the 
surface roughness on the microlens array in 
the caulking process. These analyses will 
allow the microlens array to focus accurately 
on identical positions, enhancing the 
illumination brightness. 
2 Experiment structure and results 
The hexagonal layout pattern on the 
plastic mask is shown in figure 1. Silicon 
wafers are used as the substrate. The layout 
pattern is a design based on the aperture d = 
70µm. The schematic representation of 
microlens array fabrication using thermal 
reflow and caulking processes is shown in 
figure 2. First, the photoresist is exposed 
through the plastic mask using a UV mask 
aligner (figure 2(a)). After developing, the 
column array on the silicon substrate could be 
defined (figure 2(b)). The column array is then 
heated to a temperature above the photoresist 
glass temperature. Surface tension 
transformed the melted columns into multiple 
half-spherical lenses with the same volume 
(figure 2(c)). Finally, the Ni electroforming 
process is applied to fill the gap between two 
adjacent half-spherical lenses, known as 
primary master mold (figure 2(d)). A gapless 
microlens array with a maximum 100% fill 
factor could be successfully produced by 
caulking process. A SEM photograph of a 
microlens array using the original design is 
shown in figure 3. Figure 4 shows the 3-D 
surface profile of a microlens array measured 
using NanoFocus µScan 3D laser profilometer. 
An atomic force microscope is used to 
measure the surface roughness of the mold 
insert. The S/N ratios and roughness of the 
original design are 25.0 and 12.8 nm, 
respectively. The following two sections 
discuss how to improve the quality of 
microlens array in this study. 
2.1 Thermal reflow process 
In this work, the microstructure 
variations in the samples are observed and the 
optimal parameters combination is determined. 
We first identify the fabrication parameters 
which are sensitive in terms of affecting the 
focal length of the microlens array. According 
to our finding, the microlens focal length is 
dependent on the 1) spin coating revolution 
speed; 2) exposure time; 3) developing time; 4) 
thermal reflow temperature; 5) thermal reflow 
time. These fabrication parameters have the 
significant influence on the performance and 
variation of the design. The nonlinear effects 
of these factors at three factor levels are 
examined in this study. A L18 orthogonal array 
is used for these experiments. Table 1 shows 
each factor level selected for thermal reflow 
process. A 3-level factorial experiment design 
is used for the control factors. The original 
design is set as the central level. 
The S/N ratio of the experiment results 
for thermal reflow process is shown in Table 2. 
Effects plots of focal length and S/N ratio on 
control factors are shown in figure 5. The 
and has an optimum brightness appearance. 
The metal ion mass transportation is 
dominated by convection. Agitation (mixing) 
is required in the plating process to maintain 
optimum nickel deposit placement prevent 
anode/cathode polarization effects and 
improve coverage. 
The caulking time must be precisely 
controlled so that only the borders of two 
adjacent lenses make contact. Too much time 
causes a flattened lens sag profile. Too little 
time results in the lens border not reaching the 
neighbor lens, causing a gap between the two 
lenses. The thickness growth rate equation for 
electroforming layer is expressed as

and ρ=8.9 g/cm3 according to Graham.21 V is 
the thickness growth rate of deposition in 
µm/min and θ is the area current density 
deposition in mA/cm2. To easily calculate the 
growth rate, equation (1) can be written as 
0.0205V θ=  (2) 
where 0.0205 is the conversion constant. From 
geometry analysis in figure 6 the caulking 
time t can be determined as

where C represents the pitch distance for the

diameter and the lens height, respectively, 
after the thermal reflow process. 
This work will concentrate on the 
relationship between the nickel electroforming 
surface property and electrolyte parameters. 
Electrolyte parameters such as pH-value, 
temperature, current density, the brightener 
content and wetting agent will be examined 
with respect to surface roughness. The 
primary function of nickel chloride is to 
improve anode corrosion and promote 
conductivity. The pH of the plating solution is 
an important control parameter, since it can 
affect the appearance, efficiency, and physical 
properties of the deposition. In general, higher 
pH values cause brittle deposits; lower pH 
values increase the pitting tendency and 
reduce the efficiency of the process. Each 
process has an optimum operating pH range. 
The pH range for plating solutions should be 
carefully controlled. Boric acid is an 
inexpensive pH buffer and tends to stabilize 
the pH in the cathode film of all nickel plating 
solutions. Wetting agents lower the surface 
tension of the plating solution to a range of 30 
to 40 dynes/cm, reducing the tendency for 
hydrogen gas bubbles to remain on the surface 
of the part. These bubbles, eventually, will 
burst and produce a pit on the plated part. The 
brightener when added to a nickel electrolyte 
produces lustrous deposits with a high degree 
of reflectivity. Control factors and levels for 
the caulking process are listed as shown in 
table 4. 
An atomic force microscope was used to 
measure the surface roughness of the mold 
insert. The actual scanned area for each 
measurement point on the curved surfaces is 5 
× 5 µm2. The roughness of the experiment 
results is shown in table 5. The effects plots of 
roughness on control factors for caulking 
process are shown in figure 7. It shows that a 
better surface is observed at the current 
density of 2ASD. It reveals that the nucleation 
rate is lower than the growth rate at lower 
current densities. A high deposition rate 
induces defects such as microtwin and 
microstrain. In addition, various pH values 
will also affect the surface roughness and 
figure 7 shows that less surface roughness is 
obtained at the middle level (pH value = 4). It 
also reveals that a smoother surface 
morphology can be produced at a temperature 
of 60°C. From figure 7, the optimal parameter 
combination A2B3C2D1E2 is selected.
