Abstract 
Miniemulsion copolymerizations of styrene (ST) and stearyl methacrylate (SMA) or lauryl methacrylate 
(LMA)) were investigated. Miniemulsions comprising ST and various levels of SMA showed very good 
storage stability against the diffusional degradation of monomer droplets (Ostwald ripening), whereas 
miniemulsions comprising ST and various levels of LMA exhibited significant Ostwald ripening. In 
subsequent miniemulsion copolymerizations of ST and SMA, particle nucleation occurring in the continuous 
aqueous phase (homogeneous nucleation) plays an important role in the particle formation process in 
addition to monomer droplet nucleation. The final overall conversion and the individual conversions of ST 
and SMA all decrease with increasing SMA concentration. Furthermore, at a particular reaction time, the 
individual conversion of SMA is always greater than that of ST. Monomer droplet nucleation was retarded 
severely for the monomer pair ST/LMA, presumably due to the very strong Ostwald ripening effect. As a 
result, relatively slow rates of copolymerization of ST and LMA were attained compared to the ST/SMA 
counterpart.

photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed that a concentration gradient of monomeric units of SMA 
within the polymeric film was established during film formation and the concentration of monomeric units 
of SMA was the highest within the surface layer. This implies that copolymer species with different 
compositions formed during polymerization, presumably due to a mixed mode of particle nucleation 
(monomer droplet nucleation and homogeneous nucleation) and the monomer pair ST/SMA with different 
reactivity ratios and solubility parameters [30]. To further verify this postulation, the objective of this work 
was therefore to gain a better understanding of the copolymerization kinetics and mechanisms for the two 
monomer pairs ST/SMA and ST/LMA. 
Experimental 
Materials 
The chemicals used include ST (Taiwan Styrene), SMA (Aldrich), LMA (Aldrich, 95%), sodium lauryl 
sulfate (SLS, J. T. Baker, 99%), sodium persulfate (SPS, Riedel de Haen), and sodium bicarbonate (Riedel 
de Haen) as the buffer. Other reagents used include dichloromethane (Riedel de Haen), ethanol (95%), 
chloroform (Acros), toluene (Acros), pure nitrogen gas, and deionized water (Barnsted, Nanopure Ultrapure 
Water System, specific conductance < 0.057 μS/cm). SMA was recrystallized in ethanol, and ST distilled 
under reduced pressure before use. Other chemicals were used as received. 
Preparation and characterization of miniemulsions  
The miniemulsion was prepared by dissolving SLS and sodium bicarbonate in water and costabilizer (SMA 
or LMA) in ST, respectively. The oily and aqueous solutions were mixed using a mechanical agitator at 400 
rpm for 10 minutes. The resultant emulsion was then homogenized with an ultrasonic homogenizer (Misonix 
sonicator 3000) for ten cycles of 5 minutes in length with 2 minutes off-time, and the output power set at 12 
W. A typical miniemulsion formulation comprises the aqueous phase (160 g of water, 2.66 mM of sodium 
bicarbonate and 5 mM of SLS), the monomer charge (40 g of ST, kept constant in this study) and various 
amounts of costabilizers (SMA or LMA). The runs corresponding to the mass ratios of ST:SMA = 1:1, 2:1 
and 4:1 were designated as S11, S21 and S41, respectively. The runs corresponding to the mass ratios of 
ST:LMA  = 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1, 16:1 and 50.4:1 were designated as L11, L21, L41, L81, L161 and L501, 
 4 
SMA or LMA in the recipe. The individual conversion of SMA or LMA was then determined by the FTIR 
characteristic peak area at 1635 1/cm for -C=C- of SMA or LMA according to a calibration curve obtained 
from pure SMA (peak area = 14874×concentration (g/g)) or LMA (peak area = 18564×concentration (g/g)). 
Results and discussion 
Stability of miniemulsions upon aging 
The rate of Ostwald ripening (RO) for the two-component disperse phase system can be calculated by the 
following equation based on the modified LSW theory [31]:  
RO = 1/8 d (dm
3
)/d t = 8σDcVmCc(∞)/(9RTvc)     (1) 
where dm is the monomer droplet diameter, t the aging time, σ the droplet-water interfacial tension, Dc the 
molecular diffusivity of costabilizer in water, Vm the molar volume of monomer in the droplets,  Cc(∞) the 
solubility of the bulk costabilizer in water, R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and vc the volume 
fraction of costabilizer in the monomer droplets. Figure 1 shows the data of dm
3
 as a function of t for 
miniemulsions of ST stabilized by various levels of SMA or LMA at 30 
o
C. The concentration of SLS was 
kept constant at 5 mM which is slightly below the critical micelle concentration (CMC, 8.2 mM) [32]. 
Ostwald ripening does not occur eventually for the series of miniemulsions comprising ST and SMA, as 
shown in Figs. 1a and 2. This is due to the fact that SMA is an extremely effective costabilizer and it can 
provide sufficient osmotic pressure to counterbalance the Laplace pressure (Ostwald ripening). On the other 
hand, the Ostwald ripening effect plays an important role in the stability of miniemulsions comprising ST 
and LMA, even for the runs with the weight fraction of LMA greater than 0.1 (Fig. 1b,c). The Ostwald 
ripening rate first decreases and then levels off with increasing LMA concentration for the series of  
miniemulsions containing ST and LMA (Fig. 2). This is because LMA (water solubility 1.38×10-8 cm3/cm3) 
is less hydrophobic than SMA (water solubility ca. 3.23×10-9 cm3/cm3) [5]. The higher the water solubility 
of costabilizer, the faster the Ostwald ripening rate, according to Eq. 1. It should be noted that the rate of 
Ostwald ripening is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (Eq. 1). Thus, the Ostwald ripening 
rates of miniemulsions at the polymerization temperature (70 ℃) are overestimated by a factor of ca. 12%

monomer droplet nucleation and homogeneous nucleation mechanisms. With the assumption of negligible 
desorption of free radicals out of the latex particles (a reasonable assumption for the copolymerization 
systems containing the hydrophobic monomer pairs ST/SMA and ST/LMA), the following relationship can 
be used to estimate n [33]. 
n = (0.25+α ’/2)1/2         (3) 
where the dimensionless group α ’ is defined as ρ ivp/ktpNp, ρ i = 2fkd[I]w is the rate of generation of free 
radicals in the aqueous phase, f the initiator efficiency factor, kd the initiator decomposition rate constant, 
[I]w the concentration of initiator in water, vp the volume of a latex particle, ktp the termination rate constant 
in the latex particles, and Np the number of latex particles per unit volume of water. The value of f was 
assumed to be one and kd and ktp(ST) at 70 ℃ are 2.33×10
-5
 1/s [34] and 6×107 L/mol-s [35], respectively. 
The estimated values of n and nNp,f are summarized in Table 1. The value of n increases slightly with 
increasing costabilizer level for the ST/SMA copolymerization system (quite close to the Smith-Ewart Case 
2 kinetics), whereas n increases significantly with increasing costabilizer level for the ST/LMA 
copolymerization system (in the Smith-Ewart Case 3 kinetics region). The product of n and Np,f decreases 
with increasing SMA level. This trend supports the kinetic data shown in Fig. 3; the larger the value of nNp,f, 
the faster the rate of polymerization. 
The propagation rate constant at 70 ℃ for the homologous series of alkyl methacrylates in increasing 
order is: ST (409 L/mol-s [36]) < methyl methacrylate (862 [37]) < ethyl methacrylate (1149 [36]) < n-butyl 
methacrylate (973 [36]) < LMA (1003 [36]). It seems reasonable to assume that, for the homologous series 
of alkyl methacrylates, SMA should have a larger propagation rate constant than MMA. Thus, the 
propagation rate constant of SMA is expected to be greater than that of ST. The greater the propagation rate 
constant, the faster the rate of polymerization. 
The reactivity ratios of the monomer pair ST/SMA can be estimated by the Finemann-Ross (FR), 
Inverted Finemann-Ross (IFR) and Kelen-Tudos (KT) methods [38]. First, the FR equation can be written as   
G = rm H－rc,          (4)

A general feature of the d versus t profiles is that the average colloidal particle size first decreases to 
a minimum and then increases gradually to a plateau (Fig. 4). The initial decrease of d is attributed to the 
formation of tiny particle nuclei (ca. 10
0
 nm in diameter) in the continuous aqueous phase [19]. Micellar 
nucleation can be ruled out because the SLS concentration used in this work is below its CMC. Under the 
circumstance, the average colloidal particle size starts to decrease from the very beginning of polymerization 
and, ultimately, the ratio Np,f/Nm,i is greater than unity. Homogeneous nucleation stops and a minimal value 
of d is achieved when the total particle surface area is large enough to capture all the oligomeric radicals 
generated in water. This is followed by the slow growth of the particles by acquiring monomer molecules 
from unnucleated monomer droplets. It is noteworthy that the particles originating from homogeneous 
nucleation do not contain any SMA species because the extremely hydrophobic SMA molecules cannot 
diffuse from monomer droplets or particles originating from monomer droplet nucleation, across the 
aqueous phase, into the water-borne particle nuclei. As a result, the apparent reactivity ratios of ST and 
SMA for the miniemulsion copolymerization system are quite different from those obtained from the 
solution copolymerization system. All these factors (i.e., the number of reaction loci per unit volume of 
water, the propagation rate constant and the apparent reactivity ratios of ST and SMA for the miniemulsion 
copolymerizations of ST and SMA) support the kinetic behavior observed in Fig. 3. 
 In contrast to the ST/SMA series, miniemulsions with various mass ratios of ST to LMA all exhibit 
significant Ostwald ripening and the Ostwald ripening rate decreases with increasing LMA concentration 
(Figs. 1b, 1c and 2). This is as would be expected since LMA (water solubility = 1.38×10-8 cm3/cm3 [5]) is 
not as effective as the extremely hydrophobic SMA (water solubility = 3.23×10-9 cm3/cm3 [5]) in retarding 
the diffusional degradation of monomer droplets (Ostwald ripening). Figure 6 shows the individual 
conversions of ST and LMA as a function of time for miniemulsion copolymerizations of ST and LMA with 
various levels of LMA at 70 ℃. Similar to the monomer pair ST/SMA, the rate of polymerization of LMA is 
much faster than that of ST regardless of the LMA concentration. As expected, the larger propagation rate 
constant [36] and reactivity ratio of LMA (Table 2) compared to those of ST are responsible for such a 
polymerization kinetic behavior. In addition, the decreased value of nNp,f with LMA level also contributes to 
some extent to the observed kinetic behavior in Fig. 6.

with increasing LMA in Table 1. Thus, the final overall conversion decreases with increasing LMA 
concentration.  
Conclusions 
Miniemulsion copolymerizations of styrene (ST) and alkyl methacrylates (including stearyl methacrylate 
(SMA) and lauryl methacrylate (LMA)) were investigated. The miniemulsions comprising ST and various 
levels of SMA upon aging at 30 ℃ showed very good stability against the diffusional degradation of 
monomer droplets (Ostwald ripening), whereas miniemulsions comprising ST and various levels of LMA 
exhibited significant Ostwald ripening. The Ostwald ripening first decreases and then levels off when the 
level of LMA is increased. This is attributed to the more hydrophobic SMA that acts as a very effective 
reactive costabilizer in stabilizing the ST miniemulsions. 
  In miniemulsion copolymerizations of ST and SMA, in which Ostwald ripening was greatly retarded, 
particle nucleation occurring in the continuous aqueous phase (homogeneous nucleation) plays an important 
role in addition to monomer droplet nucleation. The final overall conversion and the individual conversions 
of ST and SMA all decrease with increasing SMA concentration. This is caused by the decreased number 
density of particle nuclei (i.e., reaction loci) with the SMA concentration. Furthermore, at a particular 
reaction time, the conversion of SMA is always greater than that of ST, and the difference between the 
individual conversions of ST and SMA increases with increasing SMA concentration. This can be explained 
by the larger propagation rate constant and reactivity ratio of SMA than those of ST. The significant 
Ostwald ripening experienced in miniemulsion copolymerizations of ST and LMA had a significant 
influence on the copolymerization mechanisms and kinetics. Monomer droplet nucleation was retarded 
significantly for the monomer pair ST/LMA. As a result, relatively slow rates of copolymerizations of ST 
and LMA were attained compared to the ST/SMA counterpart. Moreover, the extent of the retarded particle 
nucleation (including monomer droplet nucleation and homogeneous nucleation) increases with increasing 
LMA concentration. This will then result in the decreased Np,f/Nm,i with LMA concentration. Thus, the final 
overall conversion decreases with increasing LMA concentration.
