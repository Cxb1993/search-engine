Abstract: (Keywords: CDMA、 Interference Projection Method、 PIC Detector、 Delay 
　 　 　 Estimation) 
 The aim of this report includes the design of a multi-user, multi-path detector for 
CDMA communication system. This work includes propagation delay estimation and 
interference estimation, which is obtained by the interference projection method in 
training mode. After propagation delay and interference have been estimated, a parallel 
interference cancellation multi-user detector is used to obtain the signal of information bits 
transmitted from the users. Finally, the comparison of bit-error rate between the traditional 
multi-user detector and the detector by use of interference projection method presented in 
the project is given through the computer simulation. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In the CDMA system, it allows multiple users to communicate simultaneously using 
the same channel. The main technique is using the signature waveforms to separate users 
from one to another. Thus, there is no physical separation in time or in frequency among 
signals from users. However, its drawback is that users may cause interference to each 
other unless the transmissions for all users are perfectly synchronized and the signature 
waveforms are mutually orthogonal. This interference caused from other users is known as 
multiple access interference (MAI), and it will degrade the performance of the system. 
Hence, the cancellation of the MAI will improve the performance and increase the 
capacity of the system. 
The effect of multipath will also cause more interference to the desired user. When 
the signals arrive from difference paths, the orthogonality between the spreading codes 
will be violated due to different time delays, and the separation of the code channel is not 
hold anymore. This phenomenon introduces more interference terms than that in single

 Unfortunately, equation (20) does not have a closed-form solution in terms of D. So 
we introduced AM algorithm and Projection Matrix Decomposition Method [7] to simplify 
the maximizing problem.

There are many zeros in delayed signature waveform vector (30), which is due to the 
effect of delay and symbol jumping. The vector n  in equation (29) is a ( )1 1M G+ ×  
zero mean complex Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix ( ) ( )2 12 M Gσ +I  in 
real and imaginary part respectively. 
From [4], the received signal in equation (29) can be written further as 
 + +r = SAB n = SBA nα α  (32)
where S  is the spreading code matrix; A  is the amplitude matrix; B  is the 
information bit matrix and α  is the channel gain vector. 
Then the received signal passed through a matched filter bank as illustrating in Fig. 1. 
There are KL  matched filters in the whole system. The output of this bank of matched 
filters can be written in discrete form as

where the cross-correlation matrix are defined by TR = S S . 
We can apply the interference projection method in [4] to get the estimated amplitude 
matrix lA . With the information about estimated amplitude and propagation delay, we can 
proceed to the demodulation mode and execute the PIC scheme to suppress the 
interference. 
From equation (33), the estimated interference can be written as

where p represents the stage.

The channel attenuation factors k,1α  and k,2α  are modeled as complex zero mean 
Gaussian random variables with variace, or say channel power 2 1channelσ =  in linear value. 
This is a two-ray Rayleigh fading model [8]. The maximum delay spread mT  is assumed 
to be less than one symbol interval, i.e., m bT T<  is considered. The discrete time delay 
element ,( )k lη τ  is randomly generated, and it is uniform distributed in the interval 
[ ]0, 1G − .  
Three kinds of PIC receiver are compared in this section. Those are (I) the PIC 
scheme with perfect power and delay estimator and (II) the PIC scheme with only 
amplitude estimator (perfect delay estimation) and (III) the PIC scheme with power and 
delay estimator. We chose 50 symbols as training sequence length and 105 symbols as 
information sequence length for every simulation. The number of iteration stage for every 
PIC scheme in the simulation is 3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 depict the performances for these three kinds of receiver with the 
interference power 1 3iE E = dB and 9 dB to the desired user, respectively. 
 From the results, it showed that the performance of the proposed receiver is good and 
is better when the number of users and interference strength is small. However, it is still 
worse than the other two receivers. The reasons that caused the performance worse are the 
characteristics of the PN sequence and the estimated error propagation.
