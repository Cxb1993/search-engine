Abstract 
Working with volatile chemicals creates numerous hazards for scientists in laboratory. Therefore, it is 
restricted to do such works in a fume hood, which is designed to draw fresh air from the room into the hood 
and then out into the ventilation system, in order to prevent the accidents happened.  
According to the laboratory fire incidents investigation, the authors observed that a fire occurred in fume 
hood will be a serious problem which has the potential to get much worse in the future as more and 
complex laboratories are used and as the hood usage density increase. In this paper, the authors 
conducted the numerical experiments by using 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method to 
evaluate the fire extinguish performance of CO2 system in fume hood. The simulation results showed that 
the position of CO2 nozzle, exhaust air volume, position of sash had a significant effect on fire extinguish in 
hood. The innovative hybrid system combined fire extinguish system and local exhaust system was 
designed to ensure the flow pattern in hood could be well-controlled to prevent the contaminant leakage 
from hood sash as the CO2 system is activated.

Introduction 
Modern laboratories require comprehensive regulations included temperature, humidity, static pressure, air 
motion, air cleanliness, exhaust etc. The HVAC system is designed must function as a unit in order to 
conform to applicable safety and environmental regulations. On the other hand, laboratory research 
potentially involves hazard. Nearly all laboratories contain some types of hazardous materials. Therefore, 
the devices such as fume hoods are widespread used in school science laboratories, research, clinical and 
production labs to protect users to against airborne hazards and toxic contaminant.  
Most laboratories have design guidelines that incorporate NFPA standard 45 [1], International Code 
Council‚Äôs International Mechanical Code (IMC)-2000 [2], ASHRAE Application Handbook [3], local 
government‚Äôs fire law in design local exhaust system and fire protection system for labs. According to 
NFPA standard 45: Standard on Fire Protection for Laboratories Using Chemicals, there are two-defining 
features of a hazardous exhaust system. These features include: 
1. Automatic fire protection systems shall not be required in laboratory hoods or exhaust systems. 
Exception No. 1: Automatic fire protection shall be required for existing hoods having interiors with 
a flame spread index greater than 25 in which flammable liquids are handled. 
Exception No. 2:  If a hazard assessment shows that an automatic extinguishing system is 
required for the   laboratory hood, then the applicable automatic fire protection system standard 
shall be followed. 
2. Automatic fire dampers shall not be used in laboratory hood exhaust systems. Fire detection and 
alarm systems shall not be interlocked to automatically shut down laboratory hood exhaust fans. 
It is worth noting that NFPA 45 does not request automatic fire suppression system are installed inherently 
in fume
 hood, but fire accidents occurred in laboratory still occur. Therefore, the first purpose of this paper 
is to categorize the causes that lead 125 laboratory fire accidents in last 20 years. 
 
Little research has been done on topic development in fire suppression system for fume hood. Only two 
types of fire extinguish methods are used in modern laboratory, generally. Method one is to install a CO2 
Numerical model of Large Eddy Simulation 
Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) [4,5] is a 3D computational fluid dynamics model of fire-driven fluid flow. FDS solves 
numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow with an emphasis on smoke 
and heat transport from fires. FDS has been aimed at solving practical fire problems in fire protection engineering. The physical 
models included in FDS are described as follows:

where ),( sxIŒª  is the radiation intensity at wavelength , s is the direction vector of the intensity, ),( ŒªŒ∫Œª x  
is absorption coefficient. Due to the spectral dependence can not be solved accurately, the radiation 
spectrum is divided into a relatively small number of bands in FDS code and the total intensity ),( sxIŒª  is 
calculated by summing over all the bands. The band specific RTE‚Äôs are showed as follows: [ ] NnsxIxIxsxIs nbnn K1,),()()(),( , =‚àí=‚àá‚ãÖ Œ∫  
where ),( sxI n  is the intensity integrated over the band n, and )(xŒªŒ∫  is the appropriate mean 
absorption coefficient inside the band. The radiant heat flux vector is defined as ‚Ñ¶= ‚à´ dsxsIxqr ),()( , so 
that the radiative loss term in the energy equation could be expressed as: 
 [ ] ‚à´ ‚Ñ¶=‚àí=‚ãÖ‚àá‚àí pipiŒ∫ 4 ),()(;)(4)()()( dsxIxUxIxUxxq br

Here, ''q is the chemical heat release rate per unit volume and rœá is the local fraction of the energy 
emitted as thermal radiation.  
Numerical method 
In FDS, all spatial derivatives in the governing equations described in the above subsection are discretized 
by second order central differences on a rectilinear grid and the thermodynamic variables are updated in 
time using an explicit second order predictor-corrector scheme. The total pressure differential equation 
formed in Poisson equation is solved efficiently by a direct FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) solver.  
Grid test 
It is important consideration to study the influence of the grid resolution on simulation results for any CFD 
analysis. The choice of grid size should reflect the impact of fire dimension and fire size. For a fire plume, 
the minimum length scale that must be resolved is the characteristic fire diameter D*, that is 
2/5

. According to Quintiere‚Äôs [7] simulation results, the optimum resolution for flame 
height simulation was found to be R*=0:05. Above this value, the simulations tend to under-predict the 
flame height. Below, then the flame height is over-predicted. In addition, it is found that the plume dynamics 
can only be accurately simulated if the resolution limit is about R*=0.1 or smaller. In this paper, the authors 
not only focus on study the fire plume and flow pattern in hood, but also investigate the face velocity 
distribution on the hood opening. Therefore, grid test should be performed based on fire plume and face 
velocity distribution in order to determine the optimal grid resolution for fire simulation in hood. 
In table 3, the grid test results showed that the face velocity distribution is more smoothly for the case of 
non-uniform grid setting, and the averaged dace velocity (0.51m/s) meet the 0.5m/s10% criterion in 
ASHRAE 110. And the simulation cost for the case of non-uniform grid setting is more economic than the 
case of uniform grid setting. Therefore, we adopt non-uniform grid setting for the numerical simulation in 
this paper. The grid size in the hood is set as 0.025m, the size of grid near CO2 nozzle is set as 0.01m. On 
the other hand, we check the resolution of fire plume simulation based on Quintiere‚Äôs criterion (R*=0.1) is 
0.023m. Therefore, it is evident that the numerical experiments performed in this paper could both obey 
Quintiere‚Äôs fire plume resolution criterion and face velocity criterion of ASHARE 110 in order to make the 
accurate results after the grid tests in this study.

In this section, the authors conducted three numerical experiments to simulate the flow pattern in the 
hood and to measure the face velocity when a fire was occurred, in order to investigate the optimal 
ventilation mode both to extinguish the fire and to prevent pollutant leakage.

 Figure 9 simulated face velocity distribution in 
case 2  
  
Figure 10 and 11 summarise the simulated results of heat release rate and face velocity distribution in 
case3, respectively. The simulated heat release rate shown in figure 10 indicated that the fire could be 
extinguished as two nozzles were installed at 1/2 height, 1/4 depth place of side panel in fume hood. The 
simulated face velocity distribution in case3 is shown Figure 11. This figure shows the response with 3-s 
delay after exhaust volume was increased to 0.38m3/s. Furthermore, it can be shown that the VAV system 
can avoid the outward leakage from the fume hood and the face velocity being re-established at it averaged 
value of 2.5m/s. 
Whereas the above analysis has been demonstrated that it is feasible to integrate the local exhaust 
ventilation system with fire extinguish system in a fume hood in order to achieve the goal of fire safety and 
indoor air quality, the implications associated with it also could be applied to design consideration for 
laboratory ventilation system with multiple fume hoods. The following design concepts should be 
established based on present studied results: 
1. The fire detector system should be equipped in fume hood in order to detect a fire occurred during early 
period of fire growing. The detector installed in hood not only act a rule to active the hood exhaust 
system, but also link to laboratory alarm system to aware lab staff to put off fire as soon as possible. 
2. The control mode of laboratory ventilation system should be categorized as two modes: normal mode 
and emergency mode, respectively. The ventilation system supply specified air volume to maintain air 
quality and thermal comfortable condition in laboratory on normal control mode. As a fire occurred, the 
ventilation system was be switched to emergency mode. The return air fan should be turned off as a 
fire is occurred in fume hood, in order to prevent outward leakage from the fume hood when the local
