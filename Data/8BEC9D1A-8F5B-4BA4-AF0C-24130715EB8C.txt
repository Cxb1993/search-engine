1. Introduction 
 
For next generation electronics and circuits, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are the 
key elements because of their extraordinary advantages, such as low cost, large area coverage, 
mechanical flexibility, and low temperature fabrications. The performance of OFETs has already 
reached the level of hydrogenated amorphous silicon, which can be adopted in numerous 
practical applications. Inverters are the basic elements for complex integrated circuits. Ambipolar 
FETs employing double layer scheme and bulk heterojuction configuration have been utilized to 
achieve complementary-like inverters. [1~3] However, it requires an additional deposition step 
and critical fabrication conditions. Thus, ambipolar FETs with single organic semiconductor have 
to be addressed for ease of circuit design and simplification of the fabrication process. In general, 
pentacene FETs have been recognized as p-type devices, even with the low work function metal 
as source/drain (S/D) electrodes. In this present work, we demonstrate that ambipolar pentacene 
FETs can be achieved by an interfacial-modified layer made of PMMA. The presence of a 
PMMA layer significantly reduces the electron traps between pentacene and SiO2 interface and 
makes the ambipolar FETs feasible for practical applications. 
 
2. Experimental details 
 
The substrate of the devices is p+-doped Silicon (p+-Si) wafer and 300 nm SiO2 used as the 
gate contact and dielectric. The following interfacial-modified layer was prepared by spin-coating 
a solution of PMMA (2 wt%) in tetrahydrofuran at 1000 rpm. The PMMA coated substrates were 
baked at 70 0C for 30 min to remove the residual solvent. The semiconductor layer, consisting of 
a 50-nm-thick layer of pentacene, was then deposited at a rate of 0.2 Ǻ/s with substrate 
temperature at 60 oC. Finally, the 50-nm-thick Aluminum was thermally evaporated onto the 
pentacene film through a shadow mask to form the Source/Drain electrodes. A schematic cross 
section of our top-contact OTFTs is presented in Figure 1(a) with a channel length of 100 μm and 
width of 2 mm. The electrical measurements of the devices were performed in a Nitrogen 
environment inside a glove box using HP 4156C and Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter 
analyzer. 
 
 
device with Au as S/D electrodes has been fabricated. The devices with Au as electrodes show 
enhancement of p-type behavior, but no n-type conduction. Therefore, Au is not suitable for 
ambipolar pentacene FETs because the work function of Au is too high to allow electron 
injection in to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of pentacene, which is different 
in other systems. [7,8]

characteristics measured from MIS configuration with different Frequency. 
 
Figure 5(a) shows the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) configuration of ambipolar 
pentacene field-effect transistor and 5(b) exhibits the capacitance versus gate voltage 
characteristic at different frequency. It is observed that the carrier accumulation of both p-type 
and n-type, and it means that the trapped charges have occurred both in p-channel and n-channel 
conduction. When the operation frequency is higher, the corresponding capacitance is lower. The 
increasing capacitance means the accumulation of charge carriers, and it is observed that the 
corresponding capacitance is increasing when gate voltage is both positively and negatively 
biased. The capacitance-voltage characteristic is also a proof that the devices exhibit ambipolar 
conduction.

六、Self evaluation 
In this project, we have successfully achieved ambpoalr pentacene TFTs through interface 
engineering; therefore, we are able to make an inverter by utilizing two identical OTFTs. Based 
on above experimental results, two papers are under construction and one related paper has 
already published in Applied Physics Letters Vol. 91, p.132111 (2007). In addition, this project 
also provided an opportunity to train students. They are not only well trained for making devices, 
but understand fundamental principle of OTFTs. In summary, we completed most assignments 
which were proposed. We will continue to work on more advanced studies to explore new 
interesting phenomena.
