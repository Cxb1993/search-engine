摩爾定律在過去四十年微矽電晶體依循法則，電晶體線寬的微縮一直是矽半導體工業提升元件特
性最直接也最有效的方法，但是最近幾年碰到了幾個難以克服的問題。而這些問題難以解決的原因在
於矽半導體本身材料特性的限制，因此導入新的高載子遷移率材料當作電晶體通道，如砷化鎵或砷化
銦鎵等三五族化合物半導體最為 n型通道元件，被視為下一個世代提升元件特性最有效的方法之一。
矽電晶體之物理閘極線寬目前為 90奈米，下一階段約為 50奈米世代，預計於 2015年，電晶體的尺度
約為 10奈米，已經接近半導體製程上的物理極限。在此線寬下使用具有較高電子遷移率特性的三五族
材料被視為延伸莫爾定律的解決方案之一。 
本計畫的主要目的是製作電流截止頻率(fT)高於 500GHz的電晶體，將使用 T型金屬閘極線寬為
40奈米並搭配研製的先進製程與超高電子遷移率的砷化銦(InAs)為通道材料。評估其操作在超高頻率
時，應用於超低消耗功率、高速邏輯電晶體之可行性。砷化銦材料的優點在於電子在此材料內移動時
有極高的電子遷移率(40,000 cm2/Vs)，而且在較低電壓時就可以獲得相當大的驅動電流。因此只要使用
砷化銦為通道層材料，就可以有效提高電子遷移率以及電子浮移速度，使得元件操作更快速更高頻而
且具有更好的特性。此外還可以使元件在較低電壓下操作，將可以大幅降低電晶體的消耗功率，達到
超低電壓、超低功率的操作需求。此外，將配合本化合物半導體元件實驗室砷化鎵完整的製程線，可

（二） 計畫英文摘要。 
 
Scaling device dimensions has been the most powerful and effective strategy to boost device performance 
for the last 40 years. However, a number of obstacles have failed the effectiveness of this strategy. 
Unfortunately, some of the obstacles seem to be insurmountable by using the traditional “silicon technology 
approach”. Therefore, introducing the materials, such as GaAs III-V based compound semiconductors, is 
almost inevitable for the enhancing device performance. The physical gate length of Si transistors used in 
current 90 nm generation node is about 50 nm. The size of transistor will reach 10 nm in 2015 which is almost 
the limit of process technology. In order to extend Moore’s law well into next decade, Using higher speed 
III-V semiconductor compound materials in the device structure is one of the promising solutions for the 
CMOS technology.  
The goal of this work is to fabricate an ultra-high speed device with an over fT 500 GHz of current gain 
cutoff frequency (fT) using InAs-channel layer and 40-nm gate length with two-step gate recess. In general, 
the high electron mobility and high electron drift velocity can be obtained at a lower applied voltage with 
using InAs-channel due to the low energy bandgap. The power consumption can be reduced effectively using 
InAs-channel devices. 
Furthermore, our group (Compound Semiconductor Device Lab.) has the first one full III-V based foundry 
line in the academic area. To integrate the IC process technology with the 500 GHz device, an ultra high speed, 
ultra low power logic IC can be fabricated in this work.

In this work, the electron beam lithography system was used to fabricate nanometer (40-nm) gate 
length for InAs HEMTs. Besides, two-step recess and Pt gate sinking processes were applied 
simultaneously to effectively reduce the gate-to-channel distance on 40-nm device for the first time. 
Comparisons of the device performance at high frequencies with conventional gate recess process were 
made and significant improvement was observed.    
    
   Experimental 
   The HEMT structure in this study was grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a 2-inch 
diameter InP substrate. The structure layers, from bottom to top, consist of a 500 nm In0.52Al0.48As 
metamorphic buffer layer, a 5 nm InAs channel layer composed of a 3 nm In0.53Ga0.47As lower 
sub-channel layer with a 2 nm In0.53Ga0.47As upper sub-channel layer and an 8 nm In0.52Al0.48As Schottky 
barrier layer with Si planar doping (4×1012cm-2), a 5 nm InP etching stop layer and a 40 nm highly 
Si-doped In0.53Ga0.47As cap layer (1×1019cm-3). The In0.53Ga0.47As sub-channels were adopted to enhance 
better confinement of electrons in the thin InAs layer and improve the electron transport properties. 
For the device fabrication, the active area of the device was isolated by wet etching. Au-Ge-Ni-Au 
was deposited on heavily doped n-InGaAs cap layer and then alloyed in rapid thermal annealing (RTA) to 
form source and drain ohmic contacts with low contact resistance and sheet resistance. Before the 
formation of T-shaped gate photoresist, the 600 Å silicon nitride was deposited by plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition as the support of the following 40-nm gate foot. The T-shaped gate photoresist 
was carried out by using 50-kV JEOL electron beam lithography system (JBX 6000FS). The tri-layer EB 
photoresist system (ZEP/PMGI/ZEP) with double exposure and development was used to define the 
40-nm gate length. The top layer of T-shaped gate was exposed with low dosage, and the fine footprint 
was written with high dosage. Through anisotropic CF4 RIE dry etching, the gate foot was precisely 
replicated on 600 Å SiNx layer. Then, the two-step recess technique was performed. The first step of 
recess was cap layer etching performed by using PH-adjusted solution of succinic (S.A.), NH4OH and 
H2O2. And the second step of recess etching was achieved by inductive coupled plasma (ICP) with argon 
ambient to remove the InP etching stop layer under the gate. Schottky gate metal, which was composed of 
Pt (6 nm) /Ti(80 nm) /Pt(60 nm) /Au(180 nm), was then deposited by electron beam evaporation. Gate 
metal will form after lift-off procedure by acetone and ZDMAC. An adequate time of Pt sinking annealing 
at 250 ℃ was controlled to obtain the optimal performance for these devices. Finally, 100-nm-thick 
silicon nitride layer was deposited by PECVD at 200 ℃ for 10 min for devices passivation. 
SEM image of the 40-nm T-shaped gate is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen from the SEM image, the 
fabricated 40-nm T-gate shows structural stability even with very narrow gate footprint.  
 
   Result and Discussion  
The transconductance (gm) and the drain-source current plotted as functions of gate-source voltage 
are shown in Fig. 2 (a) for conventional device and Fig. 2 (b) for device with two-step recess and gate 
sinking process. The 40-nm InAs HEMTs exhibit very high transconductance resulting from the high 
 6 
mA/mm, which can demonstrate that this definition for InAs HEMTs has enough physical meaning in the 
logic performance analysis. The extracted intrinsic gate delay as a function of the defined threshold 
voltage (VT’) as defined by J. Guo is shown in Fig. 7. The low intrinsic gate delay value of 0.6 psec is 
attributed to the extremely high transport properties of InAs transistor-channel. 
                 To demonstrate the capability of the proposed device for low noise applications at high frequencies, 
noise measurement was performed on the device with DC bias set as the same for maximum fT, shown in 
Fig. 8. As is observed from the figure, the overall NFmin is below 2.5 dB with frequency ranging from 18 
GHz to 64 GHz, and the corresponding associated gain (Ga) is 7 dB at 64 GHz while the total DC power 
consumption remains as low as 4.33 mW. Overall, these superior results show great potential of 40-nm 
InAs/In0.53Ga0.47As HEMTs for ultra low-power, high-frequency and low-noise RF applications. 
 
   Summary 
In this study, the 40 nm InAs/In0.53Ga0.47As HEMTs using two-step recess and Pt gate sinking 
technologies for RF performance improvement is demonstrated. Vertical reduction of the gate-to-channel 
distance is achieved by the advanced process technology and the short channel effect has been effectively 
minimized with the electrons in the channel further accelerated. Significant improvement of fT and fmax 
was exhibited attributing to the increase in transconductance and decrease in total gate capacitance due to 
the shorter gate-to-channel distance. In addition, the device showed ultra high fT of 663 GHz when biased 
near the occurrence of impact ionization due to the small CGS caused by hole injection into the gate 
electrode. For the logic characteristic, a very low intrinsic gate delay (0.6 psec) is obtained because of 
tremendous channel transport properties.  
For the first time, noise characterization up to V-band was performed on the fabricated 40-nm device 
biased at extremely low DC power consumption level of 4.33mW. The device exhibited a minimum noise 
figure of lower than 2.5 dB up to 64 GHz with corresponding associated gain of 7 dB at 64 GHz.  
Overall, the promising experimental results demonstrated that superior device performance for 
low-noise and low-power millimeter/sub-millimeter wave applications can be achieved by using 40-nm 
InAs HEMTs with two-step recess and Pt gate sinking technologies.
