Abstract 
Multimedia communication is one of the most active 
research fields in recent years. The fast development 
of multimedia communication, no matter network 
and communication transmission all significantly 
improve and make the advanced applications with 
different systems and specifications possible, which 
results in the increasing demand of multimedia 
services. Transmission over heterogeneous network 
becomes more and more difficult due to the 
connection between different network protocols. In 
view of the aforementioned facts, the development 
of scalable video coding (SVC) aims at providing 
the variety of video bitstream applications over 
heterogeneous networks. Except for the 
improvement of the encoding, the channel property 
should be considered to enhance transmission 
efficiency especially in nowadays heterogeneous 
network environment. Multi-input multi-output 
(MIMO) can significantly enhance data transmission 
rate and distance without increasing the bandwidth. 
Transmitting SVC layer streaming videos can 
enlarge the robustness of data and increase the total 
transmission rate. 
 
The main goal of this project is to analyze and 
evaluate the performance of SVC video streaming 
over MIMO channel. This project expects to build 
up a multimedia communication system with fast, 
high throughput and robustness. In encoding, we 
reduce the computational complexity of SVC in 
order to speedup the encoding process. Based on the 
property of MIMO channel, a new channel selection 
method is proposed for transmitting SVC streaming 
 4
Although several research works have discussed 
video transmission over MIMO systems [16]-[18], 
few have investigated SVC video transmission over 
MIMO systems. A 2007 study by Song et al. 
proposed an adaptive channel selection-MIMO 
(ACS-MIMO) algorithm [19] to enable transmission 
of higher-priority SVC layers over the channel with 
the higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The 
underlying rationale for this scheme is that the 
channel with the highest SNR has the lowest error 
probability, that is, higher reliability to transmit data 
with higher priority. The simulation results in the 
current study show that the high-priority layers have 
low BER when ACS-MIMO is adopted. Therefore, 
ACS-MIMO can effectively protect SVC data. 
However, an important limitation of ACS-MIMO is 
its data rate. According to the Shannon information 
capacity theorem [20], channel capacity is a function 
of SNR, i.e.,  
ܥ ܤ ൌ logଶሺ1 ൅ ܴܵܰሻ⁄ , (1)
where ܥ  and ܤ  represent capacity and system 
bandwidth, respectively. Equation 1-1 shows that the 
channel with higher SNR has higher capacity. 
However, in SVC, low-priority layers have high bit 
rates. The time required for EL data to reach the 
receiver may be too long for reconstructing high 
quality video. Thus, ACS-MIMO may degrade 
transmission rate if EL data is also preferred. This 
thesis therefore proposes a new channel selection 
algorithm to accelerate SVC video transmission.  
 
Although MIMO provides high transmission 
efficiency by using multiple antennas, disadvantages 
of MIMO wireless systems include the added cost of 
the numerous antennas needed establish 
communication systems. One solution to this 
problem is cooperative communication, also known 
as distributed MIMO [21]-[33]. The concept of 
cooperative communication is enabling cooperation 
among different users. For example, if users A and B 
want to transmit data to a destination, A can transmit 
signals to the destination directly or via B, that is, 
with the help of B. User A can also help B transmit 
data to the destination. Restated, A and B can 
cooperate with each other. The increased spatial 
diversity obtained by cooperative communication 
can reduce BER.  
 
The high transmission efficiency of cooperative 
communication enables video streaming over 
cooperative communication networks. In 2008, 
Ozgu et al. proposed the application of cooperative 
communication to enhance video multicast 
efficiency in wireless local area networks (WLANs). 
Figure 1 shows how they applied relay nodes with 
omni-directional antennas between the access point 
(AP) and users to expand coverage area. The light 
blue area in Fig. 1 represents the coverage area 
obtained by cooperative communication, and the 
area within the red dotted line represents the 
coverage area without cooperative communication. 
The relays in omni-directional antennas allow only 
one relay node to transmit signals at each time slot. 
Therefore, as the number of relay nodes increases, 
total transmission time increases, i.e., transmission 
rate decreases. Therefore, they geometrically 
calculated the minimum number of relay nodes 
needed for the entire coverage area for all users. 
Their experimental results showed that cooperative 
communication achieves better video quality 
compared to non-cooperative systems at the same 
distance from AP.  
 
This project consists of two parts. First, in order to 
speedup the encoding processing of Scalable Video 
Coding (SVC), a CBP (Coded Block Pattern)-based 
fast mode decision algorithm is proposed in the 
paper. The CBP value is the syntax used at each 
Macroblock (MB) header to indicate whether an MB 
contains residual information or not. By the CBP 
values and MB modes of adjacent MB in 
Enhancement Layer (EL) and the co-located Base 
 6
 
Fig. 3: Coding structure for spatial scalability 
 
In contrast with spatial scalability, temporal 
scalability is achieved by encoding distinct video 
layers at the same resolution but at different frame 
rates. In temporal scalability, the hierarchical B 
frame coding structure enables extraction of a subset 
video with different frame rates from a single 
bitstream. The hierarchical B frame coding structure 
in Fig. 4 includes three frames types: I-frame, 
P-frame, and B-frame. The I-frame is encoded by 
intra-predictive coding using spatial prediction from 
neighboring regions. The P-frame is encoded by 
either intra- or inter-predictive coding using 
previous I- or P-frames. The B-frame is encoded by 
bi-predictive coding using both the previous and 
following frames. The BL frames contain I- and 
P-frames and the EL frames contain the B-frame. 
The set of frames between two successive pictures 
of the temporal base layer together with the 
succeeding base layer frame is called a group of 
pictures (GOP). As the number of received temporal 
scalability layers increases, the frame rate increases. 
 
Quality scalability provides multiple quality levels. 
As in spatial scalability, quality scalability also 
contains a BL and several ELs, which are coded at 
the same spatial and temporal resolution but with 
different quantization parameters (QPs).

enabling temporal scalability 
 
II. Analysis of CBP characteristics 
CBP value is a syntax used at each H.264/AVC MB 
header. CBP value indicates whether six 8×8 blocks 
of 4 luma and 2 chroma blocks contain non-zero 
transform coefficients [74]. CBP bit structure is 
shown in Fig 5. CBPLuma and CBPChroma are 
defined 
CBPLuma = CBP value % 16, (2)
CBPChroma = CBPvalue /16. (3)
For each of the four 8×8 luma blocks in one MB, the 
CBPLuma could be one of the following two cases:  
1. All 4×4 luma blocks in the 8×8 luma block have 
zero coefficients. 
2. One or more 4×4 luma blocks in each 8×8 luma 
block require residual coding. 
 
For example, CBPLuma = 0 (0000) means all luma 
blocks are unnecessary coded and CBPLuma = 5 
(0101) means the blocks Y0 and Y2 have nonzero 
coefficients. The meaning of CBPChroma is 
explained in the following: 
1. If CBPChroma =0 (00), all chroma blocks do not 
need to be coded. 
2. If CBPChroma =1 (01), the DC coefficients of 
chroma blocks is non-zero value and all AC 
coefficients of chroma blocks equal to zero. 
3. If CBPChroma =2 (10), one or more AC 
coefficients are zero or more DC coefficients of 
chroma blocks are non-zero value.

with zero mean and variance ߪ௡ଶ. 
 
Multiple antennas provide spatial diversity and 
spatial multiplexing. Spatial diversity is a powerful 
technique for mitigating fading in wireless links. 
Using multiple transmitting and receiving antennas 
in this manner enables more than one independent 
signal path. Diversity techniques can be used to 
transmit the same signal over multiple independently 
fading paths. The ܯ் ൈ ܯோ  MIMO provides a 
maximum of ܯ் ൈ ܯோ independent signal paths, so 
the maximum diversity gain of ܯ் ൈ ܯோ MIMO is 
ܯ்ܯோ. If any one path has a bad channel condition, 
signals can be received from other paths with good 
channel conditions because spatial diversity allows 
the same signal to be transmitted over multiple 
independently fading paths. Therefore, spatial 
diversity enhances the robustness of data 
transmission over wireless channels. 
 
Spatial multiplexing enables simultaneous and 
parallel transmission of multiple independent data 
packets to the destination receiver. Restated, spatial 
multiplexing linearly increases capacity without 
increasing power or bandwidth expenditure. The 
maximum multiplexing gain of ܯ் ൈ ܯோ MIMO is 
minሺܯ், ܯோሻ. The maximum data rate that MIMO 
can achieve is given by

A tradeoff between spatial diversity and spatial 
multiplexing is required. The optimal

where ݎ  is multiplexing gain, and  ݀ሺݎሻ  is

achieve the maximum diversity gain at a fixed 
multiplexing gain. The best known STBC is 2 ൈ 2 
Alamouti STBC, which can be presented in a 2 ൈ 2

Inter8×16 are insufficient. Therefore, InterP8×8 
should be executed to improve the accuracy of the 
estimation. When the CBP value does not fit in the 
above two cases, it is difficult to determine the 
complexity of the current MB. All modes should be 
checked to obtain acceptable results. 
 Temporal relativity mode selection method 
In order to reduce ME coding time in EL, the 
temporal relativity mode selection method 
determines the candidate modes according to the 
largest temporal level information. From Table I, we 
can know that if MB_modet-1= MB_modet+1 where t 
is frame index, the current MB mode is probably 
equal to the previous/next MB mode of the frames in 
the largest temporal level of a GOP. Therefore, when 
MB_modet-1= MB_modet+1, the MB_modet-1 and the 
direct mode can be determined as the candidate 
mode.

C. Channel selection for SVC transmission over

I. Sub-channels’ SNR in MIMO Systems 
We transmit a training sequence to the receiver. The 
training sequence of the ܾ୲୦ transmit antenna is 
represented as ߰௕ ൌ ሾ߰௕ሺ0ሻ߰௕ሺ1ሻ … ߰௕ሺܮ െ
1ሻሿ,where ܾ ൌ 1,2, … , ܯ் and L is the length of

matrix can be represented as follows:

The received training sequence signals are given by

where ࣒ܚ܍܋܍ܑܞ܍܌ is ܯோ ൈ ܮ received signal vector 
and ࡺ  is ܯோ ൈ ܮ  noise vector. Then, the 
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation is employed 
to estimate channel state information (CSI) as 
follows:

where P is transmitting power. The above progress 
called channel estimation (CE) is to calculate CSI. 
After obtaining CSI, we employ minimum mean

and the received signals are modified into

From the above equations, we can see that the 
proposed algorithm requires less transmission time. 
That is to say, the proposed algorithm achieves 
higher transmission rate. 
III. Error Control Strategy 
Although the proposed algorithm enhances the 
transmission rate, higher priority layers may suffer 
higher error probability because these layers that

where SER is QPSK symbol-error-rate (SER) over

The size of EL2 part1 and EL2 part2 is set as αEଷ 
and ሺ1 െ αሻEଷ , respectively; the range of α  is 
0 ൑ α ൑ 1. The process to determine α is shown as 
below: 
 
Step 1: Since the number of parity-check symbols 
for EL1 is parity୬୳୫ୠୣ୰ELଵ, the transmission time 
of EL1 is given by

Step 2: Assume that the error probability of EL2 
part 1 over the sub-channel with the second highest 
SNR is less than µELଶ′  when the number of 
parity-check symbols for EL2 part 1 
is  parity୬୳୫ୠୣ୰ELଶ ୮ୟ୰୲ଵ , where the way to find 
parity୬୳୫ୠୣ୰ELଶ ୮ୟ୰୲ଵ is the same as that for EL1. 
Therefore, α must satisfy

After α  value is obtained, we assume the error 
probability of EL2 part 2 over the sub-channel with 
the highest SNR is less than µELଶ′:  when the 
number of parity-check symbols for EL2 part 1 is 
parity୬୳୫ୠୣ୰ଶ౤ౚ EL୮ୟ୰୲ଶ . The transmission time of

Because the ACS-MIMO uses multiple sub-channels 
with various channel conditions to perform unequal 
error protection, FEC code rate of each layer is the 
same. When doing simulation, we set the number of 
error correction parity-check symbols for each layer 
in ACS-MIMO as

In this subsection, we apply three kinds of 
Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, including RS (15, 11, 5), 
RS (15, 7, 9), and RS (15, 3, 13), to protect SVC 
data. The code rates of RS (15, 11, 5), RS (15, 7, 9) 
and RS (15, 3, 13) is 11/15, 7/15 and 1/5, 
respectively. The lower code rate provides more

From Tables III and IV, the propose algorithm 
provides 75% EL ME time-saving in average 
compared to JSVM 9.12 and outperform Lin’s 
algorithm with ignorable PSNR degradation and bit 
increase. Tables V~VII show the performance 
comparisons in terms of the total time, EL ME time, 
PSNR, bitrate and saving rate of selecting block 
mode in EL in small QP-delta (QPEL – QPBL). 
The QP of BL is set to 40. The QPs of ELs are set to 
35, 30 and 25, respectively. The resolution of testing 
sequences is CIF format. In small QP-delta, the 
proposed algorithm still can reduce more than 76% 
EL ME time-saving with negligible PSNR 
degradation and bit increase compared with JSVM 
9.12. From Tables III~VI, we can confirm that the 
efficiency of the proposed algorithm is better than 
Lin’s algorithm whether in large QP-delta or in 
small QP-delta. From Table VIII, we can find that 
the proposed algorithm can reduce more than 67% 
selecting block mode compared with JSVM 9.12. 
That is the reason the proposed algorithm can reduce 
the MB time in EL significantly. In summary, the 
proposed algorithm always has better coding 
performance compared with other existing 
algorithms.

Conclusion 
This project evaluated the enhancement of scalable 
H.264/AVC video in terms of compression and 
transmission efficiency over MIMO wireless 
systems. First, a CBP-based fast mode algorithm is 
proposed to reduce the computational complexity of 
SVC encoder. The proposed algorithm determines 
the complexity of the current MB using CBP values 
of adjacent MBs. Then, according to different CBP 
values, the MB prediction modes of EL can be 
estimated by the MB partition of co-located MB in 
BL or extended direction of the adjacent MB. 
Moreover, the largest temporal level information is 
analyzed in this paper. Based on the aforementioned 
analysis, the temporal relativity mode selection 
method is used to select the best inter mode of the 
largest temporal level frame in EL. Since CBP value, 
adjacent and BL information is already computed 
before mode estimation process, few extra

46 Abstract In this study, a channel selection algorithm is proposed to enhance the 
transmission rate for scalable video coding (SVC) source transmission over 
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless systems. The proposed algorithm 
allows each layer of SVC video to choose its appropriate channel in wireless 
MIMO systems based on channel state information for transmission rate 
enhancement. Here, this difficult problem is converted into mathematical 
optimization problem to improve the performance of SVC video transmission. 
Experimental results show that the transmission rate of the proposed method 
outperforms the existing scheme.

65 Song et al. proposed an adaptive channel selection-MIMO
66 (ACS-MIMO) algorithm [16] that allows the SVC layer
67 with higher priority to be transmitted over the channel with
68 higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value in 2007. The
69 reason behind this scheme is that the channel with higher
70 SNR has lower error probability, that is, higher reliability to
71 transmit data with higher priority. The simulation results
72 show that the layer with higher priority has lower BER
73 when adopting ACS-MIMO system. Therefore, ACS-
74 MIMO is able to protect SVC data effectively. However,
75 ACS-MIMO has some crucial drawbacks on data rate.
76 According to the Shannon information capacity theorem
77 [17], channel capacity is a function of SNR, i.e.
C=B ¼ log2ð1þ SNRÞ; ð1Þ
789 where C and B represent capacity and system bandwidth,
80 respectively. From Eq. 1, it is observed that the channel
81 with higher SNR value has higher capacity. However, in
82 SVC, the layer with lower priority has higher bit rates. It
83 requires large transmission time for the EL data to reach the
84 receiver before reconstructing the video with high quality.
85 Thus, the ACS-MIMO may degrade the transmission rate if
86 EL data is also preferred.
87 A new channel selection algorithm is proposed to
88 accelerate the transmission of SVC videos in this paper.
89 We reverse the concept of the ACS-MIMO system to
90 allocate BL in the channel with lower SNR to increase total
91 transmission rate. Unequal error protection mechanism is
92 used to protect layered SVC data. A mathematical model
93 and its proof are provided to verify our perspective.
94 Experimental results show that the proposed method
95 outperforms ACS-MIMO in terms of successfully received
96 packets and total transmission rate under the assumptions of
97 fixed time delay and fixed BER respectively.
98 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
99 gives an overview of SVC and MIMO communication
100 system. In Section 3, the system model including sub-
101 channels’ SNR, mathematical analysis for transmission rate
102 enhancement and error control strategy is described.
103 Experimental results are demonstrated in Section 4 to
104 evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Con-
105 cluding remarks are given in Section 5.
106 2 Background
107 In this section, the basic principles of SVC and MIMO are
108 reviewed. We explain why we need SVC and the properties
109 of SVC in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2, we introduce MIMO
110 wireless systems and the reason why MIMO can provide
111 higher throughput and robustness of signal transmission are
112 introduced. We provide the details of the notations in the
113 Appendix for the sake of presentation.
1142.1 Overview of SVC
115In recent years, SVC plays an important role in video
116compression and transmission. SVC is an extended version
117of H.264/AVC and has been finalized in 2007. The major
118objective of the SVC standardization is to encode a high-
119quality video that consists of one or more subset videos.
120Therefore, only a single bitstream can support various devices
121with different required bitrates or display capacity. The
122concept of SVC is shown in Fig. 1. There are three
123fundamental types of scalability in SVC and they are spatial
124scalability, temporal scalability and quality scalability. Spatial
125scalability indicates that a video is encoded into distinct
126layers at the same frame rate, but different spatial resolutions.
127Temporal scalability is contrary to spatial scalability, that is, a
128video is encoded into distinct layers at the same spatial
129resolution, but different frame rates. Temporal scalability is
130achieved by the hierarchical B frame coding structure that
131allows extracting a subset video with different frame rates
132from a single bitstream. Quality scalability provides multiple
133quality levels. Similar with spatial scalability, quality
134scalability also contains a BL and several ELs, which are
135coded at the same spatial and temporal resolution.
1362.2 Overview of MIMO
137MIMO wireless communication model is shown in Fig. 2.
138Transmitter and receiver have multiple antennas. The
139received signal can be expressed as
Y ¼ HX þ N ; ð2Þ
1401whereH is a MT×MR channel matrix, X is transmitted signal
142vector at transmitter, and N is a noise vector from i.i.d.
143Gaussian collection with zero mean and variance σ2. MT and
144MR represent the number of antennas at transmitter and
145receiver, respectively.
146Multiple antennas provide spatial diversity and spatial
147multiplexing. Spatial diversity means to use multiple
148transmitting and receiving antennas and in this way, there
149are more than one independent signal paths. MT×MR
150MIMO provides MT×MR independent signal paths at most,
151so the maximum diversity gain of MT×MR MIMO is MTMR.
152Spatial multiplexing can simultaneously transmit a number
153of independent data in parallel to the destination receiver.
154The maximum multiplexing gain of MT×MR MIMO is min
155(MT,MR). There is a tradeoff between spatial diversity and
156spatial multiplexing. The optimal diversity-multiplexing
157tradeoff (DMT) is
d»ðrÞ ¼ ðMT  rÞðMr  rÞ; ð3Þ
1589where r is multiplexing gain and d*(r) is diversity gain. If
160there are only one antenna at transmitter and multiple
161antennas at receiver, MIMO becomes single-input multiple

G ¼ ðeHH eH þ 1=P IMTMRÞ1 eHH ; ð12Þ
2145 and ai,j is the ith row and jth column in the matrix A, such that
A ¼ GeH : ð13Þ
21678 After SNR of each sub-channel is obtained, we feedback
219 each sub-channel’s SNR to the transmitter. We use these
220 values to let each layer choose its appropriate sub-channel
221 and error control strategy. The complete mechanism
222 mentioned above is shown in Fig. 4.
223 3.2 Mathematical Model Analysis for Transmission Rate
224 Enhancement
225 We assume that the SVC has four layers: BL, 1st EL, 2nd
226 EL and 3rd EL and a 4×4 MIMO system is used to
227 transmit this four-layer SVC video. Each layer can be
228 divided into four parts: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4 that
229 are transmitted over the channel with the highest SNR, the
230 second highest SNR, the second lowest SNR and the lowest
231SNR values, respectively. In this work, we use layer w to
232represent the (w−1)th EL (if w=2,3, or 4) or BL (if w=1).
233The size of layer w is Ew. For layer w, there are ow1Ew bits
234transmitted over the channel with the lowest SNR, ow2Ew
235bits with the second lowest SNR, ow3Ew bits with the second
236highest SNR, and ow4Ew bits with the highest SNR, where
2370≤ow1, ow2, ow3, ow4≤1 and ow1þ ow2 þ ow3 þ ow4 ¼ 1. The
238above arrangement is shown in Fig. 5. We analyze the
239mathematical model in two ways. One aims at receiving
240maximal quantity of video packets during fixed time delay,
241and the other reducing total transmission time while the size
242of video bitstream is fixed.
2433.2.1 Maximizing Quantity of Video Packets at Fixed Time
244Delay
245Three new matrices O, E and C are constructed, where the
246dimensions of O, E, and C are 4×4, 4×1 and 4×1
247respectively. Each element in the ith row and jth column of
248O is denoted as oij. The ith row element of E and C is
249demoted as Ei and Ci respectively. C1 is the capacity (bits/s)
250of the channel with the lowest SNR, C2 is the capacity (bits/s)
251of the channel with the second lowest SNR, C3 (bits/s) is the
252capacity of the channel with the second highest SNR, and C4
253(bits/s) is the capacity of the channel with the highest SNR.
254The sth row element of OE stands for the size of the data
255transmitted over the sub-channel with the SNR order 4–s. If
256we want to achieve the highest transmission rate, we must
257find the matrix O that makes the receiver receive the maximal
258size of data during the time delay Tdelay. In order to achieve
259this goal, all channels must be used during Tdelay, that is, we
260must find the matrix O that makes

29456 Because we want all BL packets to be received success-
297 fully during Tdelay, Tdelay≥E1/C1. However, 0≤oz1, oz2, oz3,
298 oz4≤1 and oz1 þ oz2 þ oz3 þ oz4 ¼ 1, we choose
ozz ¼ 1 and ozl ¼ 0: ð24Þ
2993001 It indicates that the BL should be transmitted over the
302 channel with the lowest SNR, the 1st EL with the second
303 lowest SNR, the 2nd EL with the second highest SNR, and
304 the 3rd EL with the highest SNR value.
305 3.2.2 Total Transmission Time Reduction of Fixed Video
306 Bistream Size
307 Here, we show the comparison of the transmission time of
308 the four layers. In ACS-MIMO, the total transmission time is
maxðE1=C4;E2=C3;E3=C2;E4=C1Þ ¼ E4=C1
ð∵E1  E2  E3  E4;C4  C3  C2  C1
∴E4=C1  E3=C2  E2=C3  E1=C4Þ
ð25Þ
309101 In the proposed algorithm, the total transmission time is
maxðE1=C1;E2=C2;E3=C3;E4=C4Þ
 maxðE4=C1;E4=C2;E4=C3;E4=C4Þ ¼ E4=C1
ð26Þ
31234 From the above equations, we can see that the
315 proposed algorithm requires less transmission time.
316 That is to say, the proposed algorithm achieves higher
317 transmission rate.
318 3.3 Error Control Strategy
319 Although the proposed algorithm enhances the transmis-
320 sion rate, higher priority layers may suffer higher error
321 probability because these layers that have less bitrates
322 are allowed to transmit over the channel with less SNR.
323 In SVC, the loss of the higher priority layer degrades
324video quality dramatically. Though error correction code
325can protect transmitted videos, the ways to determine
326code rate still depend on different channel conditions.
327Therefore, an efficient error control strategy is highly
328desired. In this section, two kinds of error control
329strategy are proposed for two different simulation
330environments.
3313.3.1 BL for Spatial Diversity During Fixed Time Delay
332In Fig. 6, we let BL be transmitted over the two sub-
333channels with the lowest SNR and the second lowest SNR.
334We fix time delay Tdelay and symbol duration Ts, which is
335set as 1/fc for QPSK modulation. Reed-Solomon (RS) [25]
336codes is chosen to perform forward error correction
337(FEC). The block length of RS code is set as 15. The
338quantity of RS codes redundancy for an individual SVC
339layer is determined based on the layer size and Tdelay. The
340number of parity-check symbols for BL is denoted as
341paritynumberBL . In this paper, paritynumberBL value should
342satisfy

402 After α value is obtained, we assume the error probability

404 is less than μ(layer 3)′ when the number of parity-check
405 symbols of 2nd EL part 1 is paritynumber2ndELpart2. The

41123 Because the ACS-MIMO uses multiple sub-channels
414 with various channel conditions to perform unequal error
415 protection, FEC code rate of each layer is the same. When

417 parity-check symbols for each layer in ACS-MIMO as

420 3.3.2 Error Correction Codes Selection for Fixed BER
421 In this subsection, we apply three kinds of RS codes,
422 including RS (15, 11, 5), RS (15, 7, 9), and RS (15, 3, 13),
423 to protect SVC data. The code rates of RS (15, 11, 5), RS
424 (15, 7, 9) and RS (15, 3, 13) are 11/15, 7/15 and 1/5,
425 respectively. The lower code rate provides more robust
426 error correction. When doing simulation for ACS-MIMO,
427 we apply RS (15, 11, 5) to each layer. We apply RS (15, 11,
428 5), to 3rd EL because the 3rd EL data is transmitted over
429 the sub-channel with the highest SNR and the 3rd EL data
430 has the lowest priority. For other layers, we choose their
431 appropriate RS codes based on its sub-channel’s status. The
432 process that determines which RS codes is used is stated as
433 follows:
434 Step 1: We use QPSK to perform modulation. QPSK
435 symbol-error-rate (SER) over wireless channels is

455make the error probability of the sub-channel with
456lowest SNR applied by RS (15, 11, 5) less than
457μ(layer 4). The total transmission time for ACS-
458MIMO with EL3 error probability less than
459μ(layer 4), EL2 error probability less than μ(layer
4603), EL1 error probability less than μ(layer 2), and
461BL error probability less than μ(layer 1) is 15/
46211E4Ts. In order to achieve the higher transmis-
463sion rate compared to ACS-MIMO, we must
464choose the RS codes that makes the transmission
465time of our scheme less than 15/11E4Ts. For RS

519 10−3. Figure 10 shows the comparison of the average
520 transmission rate between ACS-MIMO and the proposed
521 scheme at different transmitting SNRs. Table 1 is the PSNR
522 comparison of ACS-MIMO and the proposed algorithm.
523 From Fig. 10 and Table 1, we can see that the proposed
524 algorithm achieve higher transmission rate when compared
525 to ACS-MIMO at similar video quality.
526 5 Conclusions
527 In this paper, a new channel selection algorithm is proposed
528 to enhance the transmission rate for SVC videos transmis-
529 sion over MIMO wireless systems. We reverse the concept
530 of ACS-MIMO scheme to allocate the higher priority
531layered video to the less priority channel and a mathemat-
532ical proof is provided to verify our perspective. Two
533efficient error control strategies are proposed to simulate
534two transmission scenarios, fixed BER and time delay.
535From experimental results, we can justify that the proposed
536algorithm receives more video packets so that video quality
537is better when compared to ACS-MIMO at fixed time
538delay. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieves higher
539transmission rate when compared with ACS-MIMO at
540similar video quality. Therefore, the proposed algorithm
541significantly improves the transmission efficiency of SVC
542videos over wireless MIMO systems.

block Y0 and Y2 have nonzero coefficients. The meaning of 
CBPChroma is explained as: 
1. If CBPChroma =0 (00), all the chroma blocks don’t need 
to be coded. 
2. If CBPChroma =1 (01), the DC coefficients of chroma 
blocks is non-zero value and all the AC coefficients of 
chroma blocks are equal to zero. 
3. If CBPChroma =2 (10), one or more AC coefficients and 
zero or more DC coefficients of chroma blocks are 
non-zero value.

In summary, the distribution of the CBP locates between 
0(000000) to 47(101111), which uses to describe the need of 
residual coding for luma or chroma blocks. 
In [7], the authors analyze the distribution of the best 
modes with respect to various CBP values. It shows that skip, 
Inter16×16, Inter16×8 and Inter8×16 are the best mode if zero 
or one luma block requires residual coding and InterP8×8 is 
the best mode when all luma blocks are non-zero. The 
InterP8×8 includes Inter8×8, Inter8×4, Inter4×8 and Inter4×4. 
Therefore, CBP is a good indicator, which can be used to 
determine coding mode fast.  
B. Analysis of the Largest Temporal Level Information 
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the frame in the largest temporal 
level of a GOP is highly correlated with its previous/next 
frames. Table I shows the statistical results of the mode of the 
current MB (MB_modet) with respects to the previous 
co-located MB mode (MB_modet-1) and the next MB mode 
(MB_modet+1). P(Match|MB_modet-1) is conditional 
probability given MB_modet-1=MB_modet+1. Match means the 
current MB mode equal to the previous/next MB mode or skip 
mode in different QPs.  
In Table I, the probability of the current MB mode equal to 
previous/next MB’s would be 96.1% if previous/next MB 
modes are the same. Therefore, we can estimate the current 
MB mode by analyzing the previous/next co-located MB 
modes for the frames in the largest temporal level. As 
mentioned above, total coding time can be reduced 
significantly.

III. PROPOSED CBP-BASED FAST MODE DECISION 
ALGORITHM 
As the observation in Sec. 2, this paper develops a 
CBP-based fast mode decision algorithm, which combines the 
temporal relativity mode selection method. When the frames 
are not in the largest temporal level of GOP in EL, the 
proposed algorithm determine the required number of test 
coding modes in EL shown in Fig. 4. CBP value is adopted to 
determine the MB complexity and the candidate modes 
required can be reduced. For the frames in the largest 
temporal level of GOP in EL, the temporal relativity mode 
selection method is used to decide the test mode. 
A. CBP-Based Fast Mode Decision 
The information of adjacent MBs, such as CBP value and 
partition mode, is a good indicator to predict the candidate 
modes of current MB in the homogenous field. Moreover, 
motion information of each layer can be reused to predict the 
MB mode for the following ELs [11]. Therefore, the 
information of adjacent and BL can be used to predict the 
current MB mode in EL.  
In Fig. 4, when zero or only one luma block of both above 
and left MB is necessary to be encoded, the direct mode, 
BL_mode and ad_mode, are selected as the candidate coding 
mode. BL_mode means the co-located BL MB mode and the 
ad_mode means the extended direction of adjacent MB mode 
in EL. For examples, as shown in Fig. 3, when the above and 
left MB modes are both Inter16×8, the ad_mode is predicted 
as Inter16×8. When the above MB mode is Inter8×8 and the 
left MB mode is Inter16×8, the ad_mode is predicted as

Abstract. In this paper, a channel selection algorithm is proposed to enhance 
the transmission rate for Scalable Video Coding (SVC). The proposed algo-
rithm allows each scalable video coding layer to choose an appropriate channel 
in wireless MIMO systems to reduce the video transmission time effectively. 
We convert the channel selection problem into mathematical minimization 
problem to verify the proposed algorithm. Finally, Experimental results show 
that the transmission rate of the proposed method outperforms that of the exist-
ing scheme with the similar Bit Error Rate (BER).  
Keywords: Scalable video coding, video coding, video transmission, MIMO, 
wireless communication. 
1   Introduction 
In recent years, multimedia applications become more and more popular in both indus-
trial development and academic research. However, it is still challenging to transmit 
video signals through wireless channels because of the channels’ unreliability/ 
instability feature and various technical problems resulted from different bandwidths 
[1]. To deal with this problem, we use Scalable Video Coding (SVC) [2]-[3] to gener-
ate several video coding layers with different priorities. The terminal devices decide 
the quantity of layers they receive based on the channel status. When channel condition 
is poor, the terminal devices can just receive those layers with higher priorities to 
roughly reconstruct a passable video. However, when channel condition is better, the 
terminal devices can receive more layers to produce a video with more refined quality. 
Signals transmitted over wireless channels are subjected to path loss, shadowing 
and fading. To overcome these effects in wireless medium, Multiple Input Multiple 
Output (MIMO) systems were intensively studied in past decades. With multi-element 
antenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver sides of a radio link, MIMO systems 
have theoretically shown their excellent capacity. MIMO systems are able to attain 
spatial diversity to reduce the Bit-Error Rate (BER) of wireless transmissions. In 
addition, MIMO systems are able to acquire spatial multiplexing gain as well; i.e.; 
multiple streams can be transmitted simultaneously in order to achieve high data rate 
in wireless multimedia communications [4].

 Transmission Rate Enhancement for Scalable H.264/AVC Video over MIMO 61 
From above equations, we can see that the proposed algorithm requires less trans-
mission time. That is to say, the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission rate. 
2.3   Error Correction Mechanism  
Although the proposed algorithm can enhance the transmission rate, higher priority 
layers may suffer higher error probability. We allow the layer with less bitrates 
transmitted over the channel with less SNR. But in SVC, the layer with less bitrates 
has higher priority, and the channel with less SNR has higher error probability. There-
fore, the higher priority layer needs more robust error correction codes. 
In this work, three convolutional codes, (2, 1, 3), (3, 2, 1) and (3, 1, 2), with code 
rates R  of 1/2, 2/3 and 1/3 are used to protect SVC data, respectively [8]-[9]. The 
convoltuional code with lower code rate has better protection. In the proposed algo-
rithm, we apply (3, 2, 1) convolutional code to protect the 3rd EL, because the 3rd EL 
data is transmitted over the sub-channel with the highest SNR. For other layers, we 
choose the appropriate convolutional code based on the sub-channel’s SNR. The 
process to determine which covolutional code to use is stated as follows:  
 
Step.1: In this work, we use BPSK to do modulation. The convolutional code BER 
over AWGN channel with BPSK modulation [10] is

 (17) 
where bE  is energy per bit, h  is the channel coefficient and 0N  is variance of Gaus-

Step.2: bE  in (17) can be expressed as  
bE PT= , (18) 
where P  is average transmitting power and T  is symbol duration in BPSK. 2h  in

Different convolutional code has different 
f reed
B , f reed  and code rate R , that is, the 
right side in (26) has different value. So we can choose the appropriate convolutional 
code based on the sub-channel’s SNR.  
In ACS-MIMO, because the layer with higher priority is transmitted over the sub-
channel with higher SNR, each layer is protected by the same error correction code. 
When we do simulation, we apply (3, 2, 1) convolutional code to ACS-MIMO, and 
choose appropriate convolutional code for the proposed algorithm.

文與 39 篇特定主題論文。此會議由日本主辦，台灣中央研究院廖弘源教授為其中一位
議程主席，因此這次會議台灣方面各領域的專家學者參與非常踴躍。這是亞太信號與資
訊處理協會(APSIP)的第一次會議，明年將在新加坡舉行。 
 
此會議目的在集合世界頂尖的研究學者，其主要探討信號與資訊處理、識別、計算、網
路、系統設計及資訊安全等相關技術，依其研究領域分為四大類： 
1. 信號處理 ( Signal Processing Track ) 
2. 通訊 ( Communication Track ) 
3. 計算與資訊 ( Computer/Information Track ) 
4. 電路、系統與超大型積體電路( Circuit and Systems/VLSI Track )

內容轉換視角。筆者藉此獲得許多寶貴資訊，並與國內外知名學者意見交流，可謂獲益
良多。 
在此會議中我們發表了兩篇關於可調式視訊編碼的論文，一篇為編碼速度加速，另一篇
則為可調式視訊編碼之錯誤隱藏方法。發表這兩篇論文時，有許多國外的學者稱讚我們
所提出的快速模式決策方法，能有效改善視訊編碼系統的效能、降低運算複雜度及降低
影像位元率；對於另一篇錯誤隱藏論文由於時間限制並無專家當場問問題，不過會後仍
有一些學者當面跟我們討論。當然專家對我們的演算法也提出了些許建議，其意見簡單
整理如下： 
 
與會人士對於筆者研究最感興趣的部份就是如何有效率的提昇編碼速度。在目前可調式
視訊編碼中，模式的選擇佔了很大部份的計算量。我們所提出的演算法利用各階層之間
其模式皆有極高相關性的特性，選擇其中幾個模式做編碼。由於這些模式都有極高的可
能性會被選擇，對於直接決定模式做編碼筆者認為並不需要。在聽取其他研究學者的報
告，筆者針對每一篇論文提出了許多的問題或是提供本身的研究經驗，在來往討論中收
益良多。下圖為我們此次參與會議中的一些照片:(a)機場與張隆紋和張軒庭教授合影
