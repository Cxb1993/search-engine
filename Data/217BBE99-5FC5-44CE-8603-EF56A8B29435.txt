Algorithm Design of the DET Method for the Numerical Inversion
of Laplace Transforms
Abstract:
Over several decades, the numerical inversion of Laplace transforms is a hard prob-
lem in numerical computation since it is an ill-posed problem. The double-exponential
transformation (DET) method (or called double-exponential formula method) is one of
the most accurate and efficient schemes for this inverse problem. This method was first
proposed by the author and J.A.C. Weideman in 2003. It is an application of the double
exponential formula for the Fourier-type integrals, which we have modified for invert-
ing the Laplace transform. This method can reach high degree of accuracy efficiently.
However, the accuracy of this method depends significantly on the three parameters: the
position of Bromwich line a, the step size h, and the number of function evaluations,
say N . In this project we propose an automatic algorithm of the DET method for the
numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. Based on the results of the previous project
(93)–The optimal parameter selection of the double exponential formulas for the Fourier-
type integrals, we have analyzed the error and given a strategy for parameter selection of
h and N . As the selection of parameter a, since it involves the image of the Bromwich
line transformed by the double exponential transformation, it is more challenging. We
therefore leave it to be an open problem.
Keywords: Laplace transforms, inverse Laplace transforms, Bromwich integral, dou-
ble exponential formula, double exponential transformation, Fourier-type integrals, algo-
rithms.

The numerical approximation of this integral is challenging for a number of reasons: First,
it is posed on the infinite line with the integrand highly oscillatory as y → ±∞. Second,
the transform F (a + iy) may decay slowly as y → ±∞. Third, the truncation error and
roundoff errors will be amplified by the exponential factor eat for large values of at.
There exist many numerical methods for dealing with these difficulties. Davies and
Martin gave an authoritative survey and did general test on some popular schemes in
1979 [3] . A benchmark test focusing on three of the most efficient methods in practical
problems was presented by Duffy in 1993 [4]. A more recent further study we refer to the
doctoral dissertation of the author [7].
In the author’s doctral dissertation, we proposed a new method based on the tech-
nique of numerical integration–the so-called double exponential formula (abbreviated as
DE-formula). This approach is first making a change of variables by a double-exponential
decaying function, called double exponential transformation (abbreviated as DE transfor-
mation), to the inversion integral and then applying the trapezoidal-type rules 1 to ap-
proximate the new integral. This idea is simple, however, there is no general DE-formula
applicable for this inverse problem until the DE-formula of Fourier-type was proposed.
For the general concept of DE-formula, we refer to those articles [9, 10, 12]. We now
focus on the DE-Formula of Fourier-type and introduce to it as follows.
The class of integrals over the half-infinite interval with slowly decaying oscillatory
integrand, such as
Is =
∫
∞
0
g1(x) sin(ωx) dx or Ic =
∫
∞
0
g1(x) cos(ωx) dx, (4)
is called Fourier-type integrals. Where g1(x) is a slowly decaying algebraic function and
ω is a positive constant.
An efficient DE-formula for Fourier-type integrals was first proposed by T. Ooura and
M. Mori in 1991 [11]. Eight-year latter, the same authors presented an improved version
of this type DE-formula for allowing the integrals whose integrand have singularities in
the finite complex-plane [13]. The transformation is given by
x = Mφ(u)/ω, φ(u) =
u
1− exp (−2u− α (1− e−u)− β (eu − 1)) , (5)
where M , α, and β are positive constants.
1The trapezoidal or midpoint (or rectangular) rule has the same order of accuracy, generally O(h2),
where h is the step size. These quadrature rules usually are called as trapezoidal-type rules.
4
Notice that, in actual implementations, the choices of the constants α and β were
suggested to be
α =
β√
1 + M log(1 + M)/(4pi)
, β =
1
4
, (14)
which typically give accurate results [13].
The DET Method
Recall that the inversion formula of Laplace transforms can be expressed as formula
(2), which is equivalent to the following formulas [5]:
f(t) =
2eat
pi
∫
∞
0
Re{F (a + iy)} cos(ty) dy, (15)
f(t) =
−2eat
pi
∫
∞
0
Im{F (a + iy)} sin(ty) dy, (16)
or their average.
f(t) =
eat
pi
∫
∞
0
[Re{F (a + iy)} cos(ty)− Im{F (a + iy)} sin(ty)] dy. (17)
These integrals essentially are of Fourier-type. The DE-formulas of Fourier-type can
therefore be applied to inverting the Laplace transform numerically. For example, in the
sine-type inversion formula (16), by making a change of variables y = Mφ(u)/t, φ(u)
defined as (5), we have
f(t) = −2Me
at
pit
∫
∞
−∞
Im {F (a + iMφ(u)/t)} sin (Mφ(u))φ′(u) du. (18)
Next, by applying the trapezoidal rule to this integral, we obtain
f˜(t) = −2e
at
t
∞∑
n=−∞
Im {F (a + iMφ(nh)/t)} sin(Mφ(nh))φ′(nh). (19)
The truncated approximate formula becomes
f̂(t) = −2e
at
t
N+∑
n=−N
−
Im {F (a + iMφ(nh)/t)} sin(Mφ(nh))φ′(nh). (20)
Similarly, if we apply the cosine-type DE-formula (13) to the inversion formula (15),
then we obtain
f̂(t) =
2eat
t
N+∑
n=−N
−
Re {F (a + iMφ((n + 1/2)h)/t)}
× cos(Mφ((n + 1/2)h))φ′((n + 1/2)h). (21)

Error Analysis
The error analysis of DET method for inverting Laplace transforms is similar to that of
DE-formula for Fourier-type integrals. The error of Fourier-type DE-formula is equiva-
lent to that of the trapezoidal-type approximation to the convergent integral over the whole
real line. We therefore only need to analyze the error of the trapezoidal approximation to
the infinite-range integral.
Let a general infinite-range integral be given by
I :=
∫
∞
−∞
g(x)dx, (22)
which is assumed to be convergent in Riemann integral or Cauchy principal value sense.
Then the trapezoidal or truncated sum of this integral can be respectively expressed as
I˜ := h
∞∑
k=−∞
g(kh), Î := h
N+−1∑
k=−N
−
g(kh).
Generally, there are three sources of error in the trapezoidal approximation to this type
integrals. Those are the so-called discretization, truncation, and conditioning error. The
discretization error and the truncation error are respectively defined by
Edisc =
∣∣∣I − I˜∣∣∣ =
∣∣∣∣∣
∫
∞
−∞
g(x)dx− h
∞∑
k=−∞
g(kh)
∣∣∣∣∣ (23)
and
Etrun =
∣∣∣I˜ − Î∣∣∣ = h
∣∣∣∣∣∣
∞∑
k=−∞
g(kh)−
N+−1∑
k=−N
−
g(kh)
∣∣∣∣∣∣ . (24)
8
Corollary 2 Suppose that the same hypotheses in Martensen’s Theorem hold. Then
the relative error of the trapezoidal-type sum to the convergent integral (22) can be esti-
mated by ∣∣∣∣Eh(g)I
∣∣∣∣ ≈ K1 exp
(
−K2
h
)
, (27)
provided the step size h is sufficiently small. Here K1 and K2 are some positive constants.
We omit the proof of Corollary 2. As the error analysis of DET method for inverting
the Laplace transform, Martensen’s Theorem and Corollary 2 are still valid. For instance,
in the transformed inversion formula of sine-type (18), g(x) is replaced by
g(u) = Im {F (a + iMφ(u)/t)} sin (Mφ(u))φ′(u)
and the discretization error is amplified by the factor 2eat/(th), i.e.,
Edisc =
∣∣∣f(t)− f˜(t)∣∣∣ = 2eat
th
|Eh(g)|.
We note that the relative error estimate for DET method is the same as formula (27) in
Corollary 2. Consequently, using this result, we can estimate the optimal parameter h as
long as N is sufficiently large.
Parameter Selection
We have learned that the accuracy of the Fourier-type DE-formula depends critically
on the choice of the two parameters, h (M is in terms of h) and N (from the NSC-93
project). Similarly, the accuracy of the DET method for inverting the Laplace transform
depends significantly on the choice of two parameters, h and N , in addition, the parameter
a(> σ0) which is the position of the Bromwich line.
Suppose that the required relative accuracy is tol and the roundoff errors can be ig-
nored. Moreover, the number of evaluation terms N is sufficiently large so that the trun-
cation error is less than or equal to the discretization error. Accordingly, the optimal
parameter h can estimated by letting the relative discretization error less than or equal to
tol/2; that is, we assume that
Etrun ≤ Edisc = Eh(g) ≤ tol
2
|I| (28)
holds. By the error formula (27) in Corollary 2, we have∣∣∣∣Eh(g)I
∣∣∣∣ = K1 exp(−K2h ) ≤ tol2
10
Algorithm 1
Given the Laplace transform F (s), the optimal parameter a, and a positive con-
stant dg for the required relative error tol = 10−dg. Then the following procedure
can be applied to compute an approximation of the inverse Laplace transform by
the sine-type DET method. Its result will satisfy the required relative error, pro-
vided 1 ≤ dg ≤ 14 (for double precision machine).
1. Compute the optimal h by formula (30).
2. Let N− = N+− 1 = 5, compute Isum = −2e
at
t
N+−1∑
n=−N
−
S(n), where S(n) is
defined as Eq.(32).
3. Use two while-loops to check the values |S(n)| for positive and negative
directions respectively.
(i) If |S(n)| < σ · tol · |Isum|/4, then stop and output Isum.
(ii) Otherwise, continue computing S(n) for n = N−+1 or n = N++1.
(iii) Continue summing Isum = Isum− 2eatt S(n) till exit the two while-
loops.
4. The final output N (= N− + N+) is a best appropriate and sufficiently
large N . The output Isum is a good approximation to the inverse Laplace
transform f(t), that satisfies the required relative tolerance.
Example 1
我們舉一實際之例子,稱為Timoshenko beam problem,它的拉氏變換為
F (s) =
s−√s2 − 1
√
s
√
s2 − 1
√
s− 1
2
√
s2 − 1
(33)
我們應用餘弦型雙指數轉換法(DETs method)於此拉氏變換 F (s) 上,試求其逆變換 f(t) 之
近似解. 我們應用此方法計算所得之結果比較其相對誤差, 且畫出其相對誤差和 h 與 N 之關

2 F.S.F. Lin: A New Method for Numerical Inversion of Laplace Transforms
In this paper, we propose a new method based on the technique of numerical integration–the so-called double
exponential formula (abbreviated as DE-formula). This approach is making a change of variables, called double
exponential transformation (abbreviated as DE-transformation), to the inversion integral and then applying the
trapezoid-type rules 1 to approximate the new integral.
This paper is organized as follows. We first give an introduction and then introduce the DE-formula for
Fourier-type integrals. In the third section, we shall modify the Fourier-type DE-formula to the problem of
numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. Finally, we briefly analyze the error of this method and discuss the
parameter selection.
2 Fourier-Type DE-Formula
The DE-formula is one of the most efficient methods for the numerical integration of analytic functions. It was
first proposed by Takahasi and Mori in 1974 [8]. The basic idea of DE-formula is based on the property that the
trapezoid-type rule achieves high degree of accuracy to the infinite-range integrals with fast decaying integrand
[6, 7]. Many types of DE-formula are used to approximate various kinds of integrals. For the details we refer to
the articles [8, 9].
We now focus on a new type of DE-formula, which is efficient for the class of integrals with slowly decaying
oscillatory integrand. It was proposed by T. Ooura and M. Mori in 1991 [10]. The integrals
Is =
∫
∞
0
g1(x) sin(ωx) dx or Ic =
∫
∞
0
g1(x) cos(ωx) dx, (4)
are typically slowly decaying oscillatory, where g1(x) is a slowly decaying algebraic function and ω is a positive
constant. These integrals are called as Fourier-type integrals.
An improved version of DE-formula for this type integrals was presented by the same authors in 1999. The
transformation is given by
x = Mφ(u)/ω, φ(u) =
u
1− exp (−2u− α (1− e−u)− β (eu − 1))
, (5)
where M , α, and β are positive constants. This transformation has the properties that{
φ(t) −→ 0, φ′(t) −→ 0, as t −→ −∞,
φ(t) −→ t, φ′(t) −→ 1, as t −→ +∞,
(6)
double exponentially. Accordingly, by making a variable transformation with (5), the sine-type integral Is be-
comes
Is =
M
ω
∫
∞
−∞
g1(Mφ(u)/ω) sin(Mφ(u))φ
′(u) du. (7)
And then applying the trapezoid rule to this integral, we obtain
Is, h =
Mh
ω
∞∑
n=−∞
g1 (Mφ(nh)/ω) sin(Mφ(nh))φ
′(nh). (8)
In the above formula, we have to select the constant M and the step size h satisfying that Mh = pi. Consequently,
we have
sin(Mφ(nh)) ∼ sin(Mnh) = sin(npi) = 0, as n −→ ∞, (9)
and φ′(nh) → 0, as n→ −∞ with double exponential rate. Therefore, the summand in formula (8) approaches
zero double exponentially as n tends to ±∞. As a result, one can find moderate positive integers N+ and N− so
that the truncated formula:
I
(N)
s, h =
pi
ω
N+∑
n=−N
−
g1 (Mφ(nh)/ω) sin(Mφ(nh))φ
′(nh), N = N+ + N− + 1, (10)
1 The trapezoid or midpoint (or rectangle) rule has the same order of accuracy, generally O(h2), where h is the step size. These
quadrature rules usually are called as trapezoid-type rules.
