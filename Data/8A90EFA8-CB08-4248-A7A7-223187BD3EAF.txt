Morakot and Hurricane Katrina to verify its 
feasibility. 
[2] A method is proposed to design wideband LNAs made 
of cascaded common-gate (CG) and common-source (CS) 
stages with a parallel-to-series resonant interstage 
matching network. The first CG stage has a dual-band 
response, and the second CS stage has higher gain 
between these two bands. By applying the proposed 
interstage matching technique, conjugate matching is 
achieved at high and low bands while the midband loss 
is compensated by the second stage. The output 
network of the first stage and the input network of 
the second stage resonate at the same frequency. Two 
wideband LNAs are designed based on this method and 
implemented in 0.18μm RF-mixed signal CMOS process. 
The first LNA operates at 3.1 - 10.3 GHz, having 9.6-
12.71 dB of power gain and 2.5 -3.9 dB of noise 
figure at the power consumption of 13.4 mW. The 
second LNA operates at 14.3 - 29.3 GHz, having  dB of 
power gain and 4.3-5.8 dB of noise figure at the 
power consumption of 13.9 mW. 
[3] A circularly polarized (CP) cavity-backed annular 
slot antenna for GPS receiver is designed to operate 
in both the L1 and L2 bands of the Global Positioning 
System (GPS). The measured impedance bandwidths with 
VSWR less than 2 are 3.7 % (1.19-1.235 GHz) and 1.2 % 
(1.565-1.585 GHz), respectively, the measured 3 dB 
axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth are 0.9 % (1.220-1.231 
GHz) and 0.6 % (1.572-1.581 GHz), respectively. A

II. DGPS ALGORITHM
The ionospheric and tropospheric perturbations to the GPS
signals received at two close-by GPS receivers can be com-
pensated to some extent by applying the DGPS technique
[39]–[42]. The carrier phase φ and the pseudorange ρ between
a GPS satellite and a receiver are defined as [39], [40], [43]
φ = r + Iφ + Tφ + c(δt
s − δtu)− λNφ + εφ
ρ = r + Iρ + Tρ + c(δt
s − δtu) + ερ
where λ is the wavelength of the GPS signal, r is the distance
between the satellite and the receiver, Iφ,ρ and Tφ,ρ are the
delays in the ionosphere and the troposphere, respectively, c is
the speed of light in free space, δts and δtu are the clock errors
at the satellite and the receiver, respectively, Nφ is the integer
ambiguity, and εφ,ρ are the noises embedded in the carrier
phase and the pseudorange, respectively. Note that Iφ = −Iρ
and Tφ = Tρ [39].
Define the double difference of the carrier phase and the
pseudorange at two receivers associated with satellites k
and  as
∆φ =φ(k)ur = r
(k)
ur − I(k)ur + T (k)ur − λN (k)ur + ε(k)φ,ur
 r(k)ur − λN (k)ur + ε(k)φ,ur
∆ρ = ρ(k)ur = r
(k)
ur + I
(k)
ur + T
(k)
ur + ε
(k)
ρ,ur
 r(k)ur + ε(k)ρ,ur
where ζ(k)ur = ζ(k)ur − ζ()ur with ζ = φ, ρ, r, Iρ, Tρ, Nφ, ερ, εφ
and the superscripts k and the subscripts ur are indices to
relevant GPS satellites and receivers, respectively. The double
differences associated with Iρ and Tρ have been neglected
under the approximation that Iρ,u  Iρ,r and Tρ,u  Tρ,r when
the user and the reference receivers are not too far apart.
A. Determination of Ambiguities at Three Carriers
The double difference of carrier phase and pseudorange
measurement vectors at frequency fα can be decomposed into
∆φ¯α =∆r¯ +∆T¯ −∆I¯α − λα∆N¯α +∆ε¯φ
∆ρ¯α =∆r¯ +∆T¯ +∆I¯α +∆ε¯ρ (1)
where
∆φ¯α =

]t
∆ρ¯α =
[
ρ(21)ur,α, ρ
(31)
ur,α, · · · ρ(K1)ur,α
]t
(2)
are the double-difference carrier phase and pseudorange mea-
surement vectors associated with K satellites at frequency
fα. Three carrier frequencies at f1 = 1575.42 MHz, f2 =
1227.6 MHz, and f5 = 1176.45 MHz are considered, which are
indicated by α = 1, 2, and 5, respectively. Similarly, define
∆ζ¯α =
[
ζ(21)ur,α, ζ
(31)
ur,α, · · · ζ(K1)ur,α
]t
with ζ = r, Tρ, Iρ, Nφ, εφ, ερ. The subscript α is removed
if the quantity is independent of the frequency. The integer
ambiguities ∆N¯α in (1) can be estimated using the three-carrier
ambiguity resolution [44], [45].
Define the combined double-difference phase and pseudo-
range measurement vectors as
∆φ¯(i,j,k) =
if1∆φ¯1 + jf2∆φ¯2 + kf5∆φ¯5
if1 + jf2 + kf5
∆ρ¯(i,j,k) =
if1∆ρ¯1 + jf2∆ρ¯2 + kf5∆ρ¯5
if1 + jf2 + kf5
where the integers i, j, and k are properly selected [44],
[45]. Define the combined integer ambiguity and combined
wavelength as
∆N¯(i,j,k) = i∆N¯1 + j∆N¯2 + k∆N¯5
λ(i,j,k) =
c
if1 + jf2 + kf5
. (3)
The extrawidelane (EWL) is a geometry-free determination,
derived to compute the ambiguity [44], [45]
∆N¯(0,1,−1) = round

∆ρ¯(0,1,1) −∆φ¯(0,1,−1)

The least squares method is applied again to get x¯ur,1, which
is then used to calculate the residual term α(k)ur,2. The process is
repeated until x¯ur converges.
C. Residual Error Correction
The positions of the dropsondes and the satellites are known
in the simulation, and the residual errors after geometrical
correction are observed to roughly follow a cubic function of
the baseline length R = |x¯ur| as
εα(θ) = aα(θ)R
3 (6)
where α = x, y, z. Fig. 2 shows the position errors based
on 1 s of received data, in the absence of tropospheric error,
ionospheric error, or noise. The position errors with residual
error correction are obviously smaller than those without it.
The coefficients aα’s are functions of the azimuth angle θ,
which is the angle of x¯ur measured from the north. Fig. 3
shows the coefficients based on the constellation status at
UTC + 8 = 23 : 30 on August 6, 2009, which remain almost
constant over 300 s. These coefficients are associated with a
specific constellation status over a specific period of time, and
they can be determined a priori. In the visionary field trials, the

error correction.
baseline length R based on conventional GPS data is sufficient
to retrieve the residual errors.
Fig. 4 shows the position errors without tropospheric or
ionospheric errors but with the noise, and the receiver position
is estimated using 1 s of received data too. Fig. 5 shows the po-
sition errors in the presence of tropospheric error, ionospheric
error, and noise. It is observed that the troposphere induces
more error than the ionosphere does, and the tropospheric
error is not completely compensated when the baseline is long.
The tropospheric and ionospheric errors can be reduced using

wind speed is approximated as a linear function of the radius ρ,
increasing from about 13.87 m/s at the outer rim R = 250 km to
32.6 m/s at the inner perimeter of the eyewall ρe = 25 km. The
upward wind speed vz is about one-thousandth of the azimuthal
speed [48].
In region C, the radial and the vertical wind speeds are
approximated as v(w)ρ,C = −10 and 0 m/s, respectively.
In region D, the radial wind speed v(w)ρ,D increases linearly
from v(w)ρ,C m/s at ρ = ρe + a1 to zero at ρ = ρe. The vertical
wind speed v(w)z,D(z = a3) is derived under the conservation of
mass, where the air density within the typhoon is approximated
as a constant. We also make an approximation that the vertical
wind speeds in regions D and E are the same as v(w)z,D(z = a3).
Similarly, the radial wind speed in region A, v(w)ρ,A(ρ), is
derived by assuming that the mass entering region B is the same
as that flowing into region A.
In region B, the vertical wind speed v(w)z,B decreases linearly
from v(w)z,E(ρ) at z = h1 + a2 to zero at z = h2. The radial wind
speed decreases linearly from v(w)ρ,A(ρ = ρe + a1) at ρ = ρe +
a1 to zero at ρ = ρe.
In region F, the vertical wind speed v(w)z,F at ρm,F = (R+
ρ2)/2 is estimated as
vm,F = v
(w)
z,F (ρm,F ) = 0.001v
(w)
φ (ρm,F ).
The vertical wind speed decreases to zero at ρ = R and ρ = ρ2.
In region G, the radial wind speed v(w)ρ,G at ρ = ρ2 is de-
rived under the conservation of mass. The radial wind speed
decreases linearly from v(w)ρ2,G at ρ = ρ2 to zero at ρ = R. The
vertical wind speed v(w)z,G decreases linearly from v
(w)
z,F at z = h1
to zero at z = h1 + a2.
In region H, the vertical wind speed is approximated as
v
(w)
z,H(ρ) =


vm,H
(
ρ2−ρ
ρ2−ρm,H
)
, ρm,H ≤ ρ ≤ ρ2
vm,H
(
ρ2−2ρm,H+ρ
ρ2−ρm,H
)
, ρ1 ≤ ρ ≤ ρm,H
where ρm,H = (ρ1 + ρ2)/2 and vm,H are derived under the
conservation of mass.
In region I, the radial wind speed decreases linearly from
v
(w)
ρ2,I
at ρ = ρ2 to zero at ρ = ρ1. The vertical wind speed v(w)z,I
is assumed to decrease linearly from v(w)z,H at z = h1 to zero at
z = h1 + a2.
The wind-speed distributions in regions J, K, L, and M are
derived in a similar manner to those in regions F, G, H, and I.
IV. KINEMATICS OF DROPSONDES
The motion of a balloon is determined by the gravity, buoy-
ancy, and air resistance. The air resistance of a chute or a
balloon under low speed of wind is [49]–[51]
F¯d,l = −uˆdwkvdw
where vdw and uˆdw are the magnitude and direction, re-
spectively, of the dropsonde velocity with respect to the
wind and
k =
1
2
CdρairA
with Cd being the drag coefficient, ρair being the air density,
and A being the equivalent area of the chute or balloon.
Under high speed of wind, the air resistance becomes
F¯d,h = −uˆdwkv2dw.
For a typical dropsonde equipped with a circle chute, weighing
less than 400 g, the drag coefficient is about 0.47 [52], and the
equivalent area is about 706.8 cm2 [53].
A weather balloon is expected to have a longer gliding time
than a chute. The buoyancy of a balloon is
F¯b = −(ρair − ρin)V g¯
where ρin is the density of air inside the balloon with volume V
and g¯ is the gravity.
The acceleration of a balloon with mass m is determined by
all the exerted forces as
a¯(t) =
F¯d + F¯b
m
− zˆg
and its velocity and displacement vectors at time instant t can
be derived as
v¯(d)(t) = v¯(d)(t0) +
t∫
t0
a¯(t′)dt′
r¯(d)(t) = r¯(d)(t0) +
t∫
t0
v¯(d)(t′)dt′
.
The dropsonde reaches a terminal velocity when a¯(t) = 0.
The density of air can be expressed as [54]
ρair =
pM
RT
where p (in pascals) is the pressure at altitude h (in me-
ters), M = 28.9644 g/mol is the molecular weight of air, R =
8.31432 J/mol/K is the gas constant, and T = T0 − Lh (K)
is the temperature, with the standard temperature at the sea
level T0 = 288.15 K and the temperature lapse rate L =
0.0065 K/m. The pressure is also a function of h as
p = p0
(
1− Lh
T0
)gM/(RL)
where p0 = 101325 (Pa) is the standard atmospheric pressure
at the sea level.
By applying all these kinematic equations, the steady height
of a balloon with specific radius can be determined, as shown
in Fig. 10.

Fig. 15. Position errors of dropsonde 5. Its baseline ranges from 65.99 to
109.05 km, starting at UTC + 8 = 23 : 30 on August 6, 2009. The standard
deviations over 300 s are σx = 3.32 cm, σy = 4.11 cm, and σz = 12.30 cm.

baselines.
will become independent of the incident direction. If such an
omnidirectional antenna is properly designed, including the
polarization effect, so that its phase center is close to its physical
center, the antenna rotation about its physical center will cause
only insignificant phase variation. In the simulation, such phase
variation can be incorporated into the phase error term.
We may also contemplate a situation that the antenna rotates
about an axis passing through the center of mass of the whole
dropsonde module, then the position estimated with the algo-
rithm will be that of the antenna. If the antenna is placed close
to or, better off, at the center of mass, the estimated position will
be that of the center of mass of the dropsonde module. There
must be many practical aspects of implementation not covered
in this paper, which may trigger the interest of scientists and
engineers studying in this field.
Figs. 16 and 17 show the standard deviations and the av-
erages of the position errors of all these 62 dropsondes. The
presented data for each dropsonde are derived from 300 posi-
tion errors, with one error evaluation per second. The standard
deviations in the vertical direction are usually larger than those
in the horizontal ones. The average position error increases with
the baseline, mainly due to the incomplete compensation of
ionospheric and tropospheric errors over a long baseline, even
under the double-difference scheme.
Although the position errors become large over a long
baseline, the displacement of a dropsonde between two time

150 km long.
instants, which measures 1 s, can still be estimated accurately
enough because the position errors are almost cancelled when
taking the difference of the estimated positions at these two
instants.
The positions of the reference stations can be estimated using
conventional GPS technique or using the DGPS technique by
referring to another known reference station.
B. Hurricane Katrina
Fig. 18 shows the simulated flight path over hurricane
Katrina. The airplane flies at the speed of 720 km/h, 12 km
above the mean sea level, and the total flight time is about
1 h. A total of 62 dropsondes are deployed along the flight
path, with one dropsonde every minute. The first dropsonde
leaves the cargo bay at 15:00 UTC on August 27, 2005 when
the typhoon center is at 24.5◦ N, 85◦ W, with the radius of about
380 km. Figs. 19 and 20 show the distributions of dropsondes
in the horizontal and the vertical planes, respectively, at 18:00
UTC on August 27, 2005.

VI. CONCLUSION
A DGPS technique with geometrical and residual error cor-
rections has been proposed, which can achieve the positioning
accuracy in centimeters using 1 s of received data, and the
baseline can be up to 120 km. An ad hoc network of floating
dropsondes has been proposed to monitor typhoon progress in
real time, in which the chutes are replaced by weather balloons
of designate sizes to extend the observation time of dropsondes
at different heights. Plausible application of such a network
has been demonstrated under the scenarios of typhoon Morakot
and hurricane Katrina. Positioning errors of the dropsondes are
analyzed to assess the feasibility of measuring the real-time
wind-field distribution of typhoons with this network.

Design of Wideband LNAs Using Parallel-to-Series
Resonant Matching Network Between
Common-Gate and Common-Source Stages
Yu-Tsung Lo, Student Member, IEEE, and Jean-Fu Kiang, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—A method is proposed to design wideband low-noise
amplifiers (LNAs) made of cascaded common-gate (CG) and
common-source (CS) stages with a parallel-to-series resonant
interstage matching network. The first CG stage has a dual-band
response, and the second CS stage has higher gain between these
two bands. By applying the proposed interstage matching tech-
nique, conjugate matching is achieved at high and low bands, while
the midband loss is compensated by the second stage. The output
network of the first stage and the input network of the second stage
resonate at the same frequency. Two wideband LNAs are designed
based on this method and implemented in 0.18- m RF-mixed
signal CMOS process. The first LNA operates at 3.1–10.3 GHz,
having 9.6–12.71 dB of power gain and 2.5–3.9 dB of noise figure
(NF) at the power consumption of 13.4 mW. The second LNA
operates at 14.3–29.3 GHz, having 8.25 1.65 dB of power gain
and 4.3–5.8 dB of NF at the power consumption of 13.9 mW.
Index Terms—Common gate (CG), common source (CS), low-
noise amplifier (LNA), matching network, parallel series, ultra-
wideband (UWB).
I. INTRODUCTION
U LTRA-WIDEBAND (UWB) radio has become a popularsubject since the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) released the 3.1–10.6-GHz frequency band for
unlicensed operations [1]. UWB applications in other fre-
quency bands have also been studied, including the 22–29-GHz
band for UWB radar and the 10–66-GHz band for wireless
metropolitan area network (WMAN) [2].
Impedance and noise matching over a wide band is the most
challenging task to design a wideband low-noise amplifier
(LNA), which is crucial to an UWB system. The bandwidth of
conventional amplifiers is limited by the parasitics in transistors
and impedance-matching techniques [3]. In [4], an ladder
filter has been placed at the input of a common-source (CS)
amplifier, but the insertion loss of the filter degrades the noise
figure (NF). In [5], another inter-stage network is added to
increase the power gain, but the NF is 6 dB around 10 GHz. The
high NF in these designs is attributed to the ladder filter.

By applying a higher gate voltage to a smaller transistor,
the input parasitic capacitance can be reduced while the
transconductance is maintained. Hence, a wider bandwidth can
be achieved under the same noise level. However, the power
consumption is increased and the bandwidth enhancement is
still limited [3].
Distributed amplifiers (DAs) have been used to increase the
bandwidth. However, they often consume more power, take
larger chip size, and usually have higher NF. For example,
the DA presented in [6] has a gain of 10 dB, NF of 3.8–6.9,
and consumes 7 mW, but the chip size is 1.85 0.85 mm . A
smaller chip of 0.87 0.5 mm has been designed by making
use of the mutual coupling among inductors, but it consumes
26 mW of dc power [7].
A negative feedback technique can be used to design wide-
band amplifiers by trading the gain for bandwidth, while pre-
serving the noise and stability performance [8]. In [9], a dual
reactive feedback mechanism is adopted to a CS amplifier to
achieve a broadband noise and impedance matching. Both a
two-stage reactive feedback and current-reuse technique have
been applied to design a wideband amplifier with good perfor-
mance in NF, gain, and impedance matching [10]. In [11], both
resistive feedback and inductive peaking technique have been
used to achieve 3.7–4.7 dB of NF over 3.1–10.6 GHz.
The common-gate (CG) configuration is known for its wide-
band input matching [12]. However, a single-stage CG ampli-
fier may not have enough gain, and cascading additional stages
may reduce the bandwidth due to the difficulties of inter-stage
matching. In [13], coupled resonators have been used to con-
struct a wideband interstage matching network in a -band cas-
caded CS amplifier. A wideband LNA operating in 23–32 GHz
has also been proposed [14], in which coupled resonators are
used as the load of the common-emitter stage.
In this work, an effective inter-stage matching technique
is proposed to design wideband LNAs made of cascaded CG
and CS stages. Two LNAs in 3–10 and 14–29 GHz, respec-
tively, have been implemented to verify this method. The CG
topology and the inter-stage matching network are discussed in
Sections II and III, respectively, two LNA designs in different
UWB bands are presented in Section IV, the measurement
results are discussed in Section V, and these are followed by
conclusions in Section VI.
II. CG LNA TOPOLOGIES

popular for narrowband applications, it is often adopted in the

Next, we will prove that two such conjugate matching points
always exist if: 1) the parallel and the series tanks resonate at the
same frequency and 2) the output resistance of the parallel
tank is larger than the input resistance of the series tank.
For the parallel network consisting of , , and , as
shown in Fig. 3(a), the impedance can be expressed as

in terms of and by solving (2) and (4), respectively, to
have

These two expressions are equal if (10) and (11) are satisfied.
Similarly, the frequency of conjugate matching, , can be
expressed in terms of and by solving (2) and (4), respec-
tively, to have
(16)
(17)
Both expressions are equal if (10) and (11) are satisfied.
In summary, we have proven that when the parallel and the
series networks resonate at the same frequency, and
, conjugate matching can be achieved at
and if (11) is satisfied.
When applying the proposed parallel-to-series inter-stage
matching technique to design wideband LNAs, one should bear
in mind that: 1) the response in Fig. 3(c) has dual bands, the
input impedance should be designed close to 50 and 2) the
gain drop in the middle band should be compensated for.
Adopting a CG stage as the first stage resolves the input
matching issue due to its low input impedance. Wideband gain
response can be obtained by choosing a CS stage as the second
stage, and letting it operate at the resonant frequency of the
inter-stage matching network.
Fig. 5 shows the small-signal circuit model of a CG stage
cascaded with a CS stage via the proposed parallel-to-series
matching network. The resistance is the equivalent output
resistance, including the channel resistance , is the load
inductance , and is the gate–drain parasitic capacitance
. The dip of frequency response of the first stage is expected
to be compensated for by the CS stage with inductive degener-
ation, of which the input impedance can be expressed as [18]

The noise factor can be modified from [15] and [17] as
(20)
where is the loss due to the input passive components,
is the resistance of signal source, is the available power gain
of the CG amplifier, and is the noise factor of the following
stage. The parameters associated with transistor include the
frequency of unity current gain , the coefficient of channel
thermal noise , the ratio of the transconductance , and the
channel conductance at zero drain-to-source bias and the
gate noise coefficient . The transconductance is selected
by tradeoff between the input matching in (19) and the NF in
(20), respectively.
For the 3–10-GHz LNA, the transistor has the width of
141 m and is biased at V, thus S,
higher than 0.032 S used in [17]. Higher value helps to re-
duce the NF. The input impedance solely due to is approx-
imately 20 , The loading of will contribute part of the
input resistance as indicated in (19). For the 14–29-GHz LNA,
the transistor is designed to have S, biased at
V, with the total width of 88 m.
Fig. 8 shows the simulated inter-stage impedances. The
output impedance of the first stage, , resonates at 6.15 GHz.
The CS stage forms a series matching network, also resonating
at 6.15 GHz. The condition is satisfied at 3.7
and 10 GHz, one below and one above the resonant frequency
of 6.15 GHz. At 6.15 GHz, the output resistance of the first
stage mismatches with the input resistance of the second stage,
making the power gain of the first stage drop and display a
dual-band response. However, in the design of the 14–39-GHz
LNA, is not quite constant, as shown in Fig. 9. Since the
inductance increases at higher frequencies, which increases
the input resistance of the CS stage as in (18). As a conse-
quence, the frequency with is separate from that with
in the higher band; hence, the gain is degraded due
to imperfect conjugate matching.
As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, seen from the drain of

14 GHz, and the input impedance shown in Fig. 11 is purely

A frequency with almost pure input resistance still exists in the

Since is the parasitic capacitance of , the magnitude of

magnitude of . The bias voltage may be adjusted to main-
tain the same . Hence, input matching and proper gain are
simultaneously achieved over a wide band.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Figs. 15 and 16 show photographs of the 3–10-GHz LNA chip
and the 14–29-GHz LNA chip, respectively. Both are fabricated
using the TSMC 0.18- m RF mixed-signal 1P6M process. The
chip size of the former is 0.83 m 0.82 m, and that of the
latter is 0.83 m 0.65 m, including testing pads in both cases.
When measuring the 3–10-GHz LNA chip, the RF ports are
probed, and the dc is fed through bond wires [24]. Fig. 17 shows
the measured , which is above 9.6 dB from 3.1 to 10.3 GHz.
Fig. 18 shows the input reflection coefficient, which is lower
than 9 dB across the entire band. Fig. 19 shows the NF, which
is between 2.5–3.9 dB from 3.1 to 10.3 GHz. The parameters
are measured with an Agilent PNA N5230A with short-open-
load-thru (SOLT) calibration. The power consumption is 13.4
mW.
The ouput reflection coefficient is lower than 8 dB
across the band. If the LNA is directly connected to a mixer
as in a direct-conversion receiver, the LNA output is not re-
quired to match to 50 . and are measured at each

VI. CONCLUSIONS
A design technique has been proposed for wideband LNAs
using a parallel-to-series resonant matching network between
CG and CS stages. Two conjugate-matching frequencies be-
come available by equalizing the resonant frequencies of the
two networks. The CG stage behaves as a dual-band
amplifier, while the CS stage compensates for the midband
gain. The CG stage also provides a wideband input matching,
and the inter-stage matching network also contributes to the
input resistance. Wideband characteristics can be achieved by
properly choosing these two conjugate-matching frequencies.
Two LNA chips have been designed and fabricated based on
this design technique. The first one operates in 3.1–10.3 GHz,
having 9.6–12.71 dB of power gain and 2.5–3.9 dB of NF, at
the power consumption of 13.4 mW. The second one operates

I. INTRODUCTION
Circular polarization (CP) is generally adopted in GPS
and satellite communication due to Faraday rotation when
signals pass through the ionosphere. GPS antennas with right-
handed circular polarization (RHCP) are required to operate
in both the L1 (1.575 GHz) and the L2 (1.227 GHz) bands.
A circularly-polarized wave can be radiated by exciting two
linearly polarized modes of the antenna, with equal amplitude,
90◦ phase difference, and orthogonal to each other in polar-
ization. Such an excitation arrangement can be implemented
using a single feed or dual feeds. A single-feed CP antenna is
simple in structure, easy to fabricate, and requires no external
feeding network [1]-[5]. With dual feeds, the input signals can
be generated with a more complicated feeding structure via a
hybrid or a Wilkinson power divider [6], [7].
Dual-band single-feed CP antennas have been realized in
patch or slot forms [8]-[14]. In [8], four slits are engraved near
the patch edges to elongate the current path, hence reducing
the antenna size. Both TM10 and TM30 modes are excited to
make a dual-band CP antenna, with a 1% of bandwidth within
which the axial ratio (AR) is less than 3 dB. In [9], a dual-
band CP patch antenna is designed by carving an asymmetric
S-shaped slot to perturb the surface current, and the 3 dB AR
bandwidths are 6.9% and 0.6%, respectively. In [10], a dual-
band CP slot antenna is designed by attaching two deformed
monopoles orthogonal to edges of a slot, and the 3 dB AR
bandwidths are 9% and 11%, respectively. A dual-band CP slot
antenna with dual senses has been achieved by loading two
spirals at the opposite edges of a slot [11]. Patch antennas with
stacked or multilayered structures have also been implemented
for GPS applications in both the L1 and the L2 bands [12]-
[14].

A dual-band GPS antenna is required to have, in both bands,
a wide beamwidth facing the sky, a high front-to-back ratio to
avoid interference from ground. In the proposed antenna, two
concentric rectangular annular slots are carved on a printed
circuit board (PCB) to create two resonant frequencies at
which the beamwidth is wide enough for effective reception
of satellite signals. A cavity is attached to the backside of the
PCB to increase the front-to-back ratio. The whole structure
is compact for portable applications. An F -shape microstrip
feed is laid out across these two annular slots, where two
different geometrical parameters of the feed can be adjusted
to match the impedance over these two bands separately, which
accelerates the design process. The design considerations are
described in Section II, the simulation and measurement results
are presented in Section III, followed by the conclusions.
II. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Fig. 1 shows the configuration and photo of the proposed
antenna. Two square annular slots and the microstrip feed are
etched on opposite sides of an FR4 PCB with r ' 4.4 and 1.6
mm in thickness. A square cavity of length D and height H
is soldered to the ground plane under the square annular slots.
Two stubs are attached to the microstrip line with wf = 3 mm
to excite proper modes for CP radiation in both the L1 and
the L2 bands.
The simulation results using the Ansoft HFSS indicate that
two resonant modes can be excited in this slot antenna, and
their resonant frequencies can be tuned to the L1 and the
L2 bands, respectively, by properly adjusting various physical
dimensions of the antenna. The radiation characteristics can
be related either to the surface current on the conductor or
to the electric field distribution over the slots. The current on
the ground right beneath the microstrip line also makes slight
contribution.
The surface currents concentrate near the edges of the slots,
the time evolution of their distribution in both bands are
displayed to help visualizing the antenna operation. Fig. 2
shows the current distribution in the L2 band, which appears
to flow along the metal ring surrounded by the two slot rings.
At t = 0, the current amplitudes at the upper left and the lower
right corners rise, and their vector sum points from the upper
right corner to the lower left corner. At t = T/4, the current
amplitudes at the upper right and the lower left corners rise,
and their vector sum points from the upper left corner to the
lower right corner. The vector sum at t = 0 is orthogornal
to that at t = T/4, typical of CP radiation. By following the
movement of these vector sums with time, an RHCP radiation
is expected.

and the L2 bands. If H is less than 12 mm, the cap of the
cavity becomes too close to the slot, the input impedance is
strongly affected, and the radiation becomes ineffective. With
all these considerations, the cavity height is chosen to be 20
mm.
As the parameter D is increased from 60 to 90 mm, the
frequency with minimum axial-ratio in the L2 band gradually
decreases, but that in the L1 band is hardly affected, because
the cavity is closer to the outer slot and farther away from the
inner slot. Note that the cavity dimensions must be taken into
account when tuning the feeding structures.
C. Parameters of Slots
By simulation, when lo or do increases, the resonant fre-
quencies decrease. By increasing lo, the stub length extending
over the slot is shortened, and the input impedance is affected.
Increasing do does not significantly affect the input impedance,
but the resonant frequencies are shift downward, as shown
in Fig. 4. On the other hand, it is found that li obviously

affects the input impedance and the resonant frequency in
both the L1 and the L2 bands. When li is increased from
30 to 32 mm, the resonant frequencies shift downward from
1.59 to 1.56 GHz and from 1.23 to 1.21 GHz, respectively.
Note that di has little effect when it varies from 4 to 5.5 mm.
Based on these observations, one may first adjust lo and li
to reach the required resonant frequencies while keeping the
input impedance well matched, then fine tune the resonant
frequencies by adjusting do.
D. Parameters of Feeding Structure
The input impedance can be optimized by tuning the geo-
metrical parameters of the feeding structure, ls1, ls2, ws1, ws2,
and g. Since the first stub passes over both the inner and outer
slots, its width ws1 and length ls1 affect both the L1 and the
L2 bands. When ls1 is increased, the resonant frequency of
the L2 band decreases, and its impedance bandwidth is also
increased. If ls1 is further increased, the L2 band will split into
two bands. In additional, longer ls1 renders better impedance
matching in the L1 band.
The second stub passes over the inner slot and extends
partially over the outer slot. The resonant frequency and
impedance in the L1 band are obviously affected by ls2.
When ls2 is decreased from 21.8 to 20.8 mm, the L1 resonant
frequency increases from 1.56 to 1.59 GHz, and better input
impedance matching is obtained, while the L2 band remains

discussed in Section II. The beamwidth in any vertical cross
section is about 100◦, suitable for receiving GPS signals.
Fig. 9. Measured antenna gain, other parameters are the same as in Fig. 6.
Fig. 9 shows the measured antenna gain of the proposed
antenna, which exceeds 1.45 dBic in the L1 band and exceeds
1.1 dBic in the L2 band. The simulated gain curve has the
same shape as the measured one, except that the gains are
2.95 dBic and 1.5 dBic in the L1 and L2 bands, respectively.
In practice, the GPS module with RF and signal processing
circuits can be attached to the PCB behind the ground plane,
close yet outside the cavity wall, and is connected to the feed
point as shown in Fig. 1 through a via. In this manner, the
antenna properties are unaffected, and the circuits are also
shielded by the ground plane from radiation.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
A dual-band circularly polarized (CP) cavity-backed annular
slot antenna with a single feed is designed and measured.
This antenna covers both the L1 and L2 bands of GPS. A
cavity back is designed to enhance the front-to-back ratio of
the radiation patterns.

The exploration on Universe has always been a human heritage, and is tightly related
to the evolution of science and technology. Telescopes in visible light have been used
in the observation of celestial objects for centuries. The use of radio telescopes dated
back in the middle of the twentieth century widely open the spectrum of human
sensibility. Many diﬀerent phenomena never known before have been deveiled and
further promote our knowledge about the universe.
Radio waves have been received from the farthest objects known so far, which take
nearly the age of the universe to reach us. At the ASTRON laboratory in Dwingeloo,
scientists and engineers are involved in developing a new radio telescope, the low fre-
qeuncy array, also known as LOFAR. LOFAR is a next-generation radio telescope
under construction in the Netherlands with long-baseline stations under develop-
ment over many European countries. Instead of mechanical steering of large dish
antennas to collect the signals, the LOFAR system detects the incoming signals us-
ing an array of plain omni-directional antennas, and processes these signals in real
time. There are two distinct antenna types, low-band antenna (LBA) operating
between 10 and 90 MHz and high-band antenna (HBA) between 110 and 250 MHz.
These facilities enable the observation on the universe at very low frequencies with
unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.
Relevant algorithms are developed and improved based on the LOFAR data. The
multi-telescope interferometers provide sparse measurements of the visibility which
is the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution. The sparse visibility data
are collected and mapped to diﬀerent baseline projections on the 𝑢𝑣 plane as Earth
rotates. These baselines range from several meters to about 1500 km. There are
about 27 core / remote stations and 4 international stations to constitute various
baselines.
To overcome the eﬀect of atmospheric noise and receiver noise, the raw data are
ﬁrst weighed properly, with the weight inversely proportional to the local density of
data points. The weighed visibility is interpolated to the grid points to match the
resolution of the brightness distribution. The latter is then reconstructed from the
visibility data by using the fast Fourier transform. Noise reduction techniques are
also applied to improve the image quality.
