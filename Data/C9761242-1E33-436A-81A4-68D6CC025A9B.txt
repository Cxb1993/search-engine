Abstract
In this report we use projective geometry to study geometric characterization
of fundamental properties of a matrix pencil, such as regularity, eigenstruc-
ture, causality and feedback regularizability problem.
Keywords: Algebraic geometry, projective geometry, geometry of matrix
pencils, linear discrete-time descriptor systems, regularity, eigenstructure,
causality and feedback regularizability problem.
1. Introduction
This report aims to study the geometry of a matrix pencil (E,A), where
A and E are given n × n complex matrices. Motivation for studying this
problem stems from control design and system analysis of linear discrete-
time descriptor systems described by the difference equation
(1) Ex(k + 1) = Ax(k),
where E is in general a singular matrix. This kind of equations is also termed
difference-algebraic equations (DAEs). A large class of physical systems can
be modeled by this kind of DAEs. The Leontieff model[19][25], consider-
ing an economic process that involves n interrelated production sectors and
the relationships between the levels of production of the sectors, serves as
an example that a descriptor form can arise naturally in modelling a prac-
tical dynamical system. Econometric models of this type were considered
by Leontieff in [21], in which both discrete-time and continuous-time cases
were considered. Besides, some physical phenomena, like impulse, hyster-
isis which are important in circuit theory, cannot be treated properly in
the state-space models[23][39]; descriptor system representation provides a
suitable way to handle such problems. It has been proven in the literature
that descriptor systems have higher capability in describing a physical sys-
tem. In fact, descriptor system models appear more convenient and natural
than state-space models in large scale systems, economics, networks, power,
neural systems and elsewhere [22][26][31][39].

3Theorem 2.2 (Bezout’s Theorem). Let H be hypersurface of degree n and
C be a curve of degree m in P such that C 6⊂ H. Then the intersection
C ·H =
∑
P∈C∩H
IP (C,H) = mn.
We have an immediately corollary since IP (C,H) ≥ 1 ∈ Z for any P ∈
C ∩H.
Corollary 2.3. Let H be hypersurface of degree n and C be a curve of degree
m in P such that C 6⊂ H. Then the number of intersection points ≤ mn.
We consider a pencil uE + vA ∈ P. This comes a morphism φ : P1 → P
by (u : v) 7→ uE + vA. Let LA := φ(P
1). Then we have the following easy
application.
Corollary 2.4. Keep the notation as above. Suppose that LA 6⊂ W then
LA · W = n. Moreover LA ∩W in less than n points.
3. Regularity
In this section, we introduce the concept of regularity of a matrix pencil,
and give some geometric characterizations.
Proposition 3.1. Given a pencil (E,A). The following statements are
equivalent:
(1) det(λE −A) 6= 0 for some λ ∈ k.
(2) det(uE + vA) 6= 0 for all but finite (u : v) ∈ P1.
(3) LA 6⊂ W.
Proof. We have 1 ⇒ 3 and 2 ⇒ 1 clearly. It suffices to show that 3 ⇒ 2. To
see this, note that LA∩W is a closed subvariety of LA. If it’s not the whole
LA then it consists of finite points. 
Definition 3.2. A pair (E,A) satisfying any of above is called regular.
We have the following easy criterion for regularity.
Corollary 3.3. Pick any distinct λ1, · · · , λn+1 ∈ k. We have that (E,A) is
regular if and only if at least one of λiE −A is non-singular.
Proof. If any λiE − A is non-singular, then (E,A) is regular by definition.
Conversely, if (E,A) is regular, then λE − A is singular if and only if (λ :
−1) ∈ LA ∩ W, which consists of at most n-points. Hence at least one of
λiE −A is non-singular. 
We try to describe regularity in some geometric way.
Proposition 3.4. If (E,A) is regular, then ker E ∩ ker A = 0.
Proof. If there is non-zero x ∈ ker E ∩ ker A, then Ex = Ax = 0. Hence
(uE +vA)x = 0 for all (u : v); in particular, det(uE +vA) = 0 for all (u : v).
Therefore, (E,A) is not regular. 
We write Eλ := λE − A and consider rank(Eλ). Let r := min{j|LA ⊂
Wj}. Thus LA ⊂ Wr and LA 6⊂ Wr−1. Pick any λg such that Eλg 6∈ Wr−1.
We have that rank(Eλ) ≤ r for all λ and rank(Eλg ) = r. So Eλg has maximal
rank. In particular, (E,A) is regular if and only if Eλg has full rank for some
λg.
5Let A∞ := ∪Ai. Then A∞ = Al for some l.
Definition 3.13. The index of (A,E), denoted ind(A,E), is defined by
ind(A,E) := min{l|Al = Al+1}.
Proposition 3.14. Let ι := ind(A,E). Then (E,A) is regular if and only
if ker E ∩Aι = 0.
Proof. It follows from the fact that (E,A) is regular if and only if (A,E) is
regular. 
We discuss now some invariant properties of a pencil under actions of
projective general linear group G.
Proposition 3.15. Given a pencil (E,A). Suppose that we have another
pencil (E ′, A′) = (PE,PA) for some non-singular matrix P . Let E ′i and A
′
i
be the subspace defined as Ei and Ai for (E
′, A′). Then Ei = E
′
i and Aj = A
′
j
for all i, j.
Proof. This can be easily proven by induction. 
Also, the following results can be easily verified by induction.
Proposition 3.16. Given a pencil (E,A). Suppose that we have another
pencil (E ′, A′) = (EP,AP ) for some non-singular matrix P . Let E ′i and A
′
i
be the subspaces defined as Ei and Ai for (E
′, A′). Then P−1Ei = E
′
i and
P−1Aj = A
′
j for all i, j.
Proposition 3.17. Given a pencil (E,A). Suppose that we have another
pencil (E ′, A′) = (E,A + λE) for some λ. Let E ′i and A
′
i be the subspaces
defined as Ei and Ai for (E
′, A′). Then Ei = E
′
i for all i, j.
It follows immediately from the above results that the index of a pencil
is invariant under any strict equivalence transformation.
Definition 3.18. Two pencils (E ′, A′) and (E,A) are called strictly equiv-
alent if (E ′, A′) = (P1EP2, P1AP2) for some non-singualr matrices P1 and
P2.
Corollary 3.19. Two strictly equivalent pencils have the same index.
We recall that a regular pencil is strictly equivalent to a pencil of Weier-
strass canonical form.
Theorem 3.20 (Weierstrass Theorem). A pencil (E,A) is regular if and
only if it is strictly equivalent to a Weierstrass canonical form:
(2) (
(
Iq 0
0 N
)
,
(
A1 0
0 In−q
)
),
where N is nilpotent.
Proof. See [11]. .
Remark 3.21. (1) Without loss of generality, we may assume that N
and A1 are Jordan matrices.
(2) The block corresponding to N is void if E is non-singular; in this
case, we define the nilpotent index of N is zero.
7By Bezout’s theorem, a regular pencil has at most n eigenvalues. The set
of all eigenvalues of (E,A) is called the spectrum of (E,A). The spectrum
of (E,A) will be denoted σ(E,A).
Definition 4.2. Suppose (E,A) is regular. An eigenvalue (u : v) of (E,A)
is said to be infinite if v = 0; otherwise (u : v) is said to be finite.
Convention. We will usually say that λ := −u/v is a finite eigenvalue
of (E,A) if (u : v) is a finite eigenvalue of (E,A). Sometimes we use the
notation σf (E,A) for the set of all finite eigenvalues of (E,A). We will also
say that (E,A) has an infinite eigenvalue or has an eigenvalue at infinity
(usually denoted λ = ∞) if (1 : 0) is an eigenvalue of (E,A).
We now introduce the concept of a deflating subspace of a pencil.
Definition 4.3. A subspace V of An is said to be a deflating subspace of
(E,A) or simply, deflating for (E,A), or more simply, (E,A)-deflating, if
there exists a subspace W of An, called a codeflating subspace of (E,A),
such that EV ⊂ W, AV ⊂ W, and dimV = dimW.
Remark 4.4. (1) Clearly, V is (In, A)-deflating if and only if V is A-
invariant. Thus, the concept of a deflating subspace generalizes that
of an invariant subspace.
(2) When (E,A) is regular, W is uniquely determined by W = EV+AV.
Lemma 4.5. Suppose that (E,A) is regular. Let V be an arbitrary subspace
of An. Then dim(EV + AV) ≥ dimV.
Proof. See [15]. .
Lemma 4.6. Suppose that (E,A) is regular. Then a subspace V of An is
(E,A)-deflating if and only if V is invariant under (λ0E − A)
−1E for any
λ0 /∈ σf (E,A).
Proof. See [20]. .
The main results of this section are summarized in the following state-
ment.
Theorem 4.7. Suppose that (E,A) is regular. Let V be an n × r matrix
with rankV = r ≤ n. Then imV is (E,A)-deflating if and only if there exist
r × r matrices S and T , with (T, S) regular, satisfying
(3) EV S = AV T.
Moreover, in this situation, the spectrum of (E,A) restricted to imV is pre-
cisely the spectrum of (T, S).
Proof. Suppose that V := imV is (E,A)-deflating. Then, by Lemma 4.6, V
is invariant under (λ0E−A)
−1E where λ0 /∈ σf (E,A). Thus there exists an
r × r matrix T satisfying
(λ0E −A)
−1EV = V T,
from which we obtain (3), with S := λ0T − Ir. It is clear that (T, S) is
regular since λ0T − S = Ir.
95. Causality
While causality holds in a discrete-time state-space system, a discrete-
time descriptor system is not always causal. As an example, the Leontieff
dynamic model in economic system described in [21] is a non-causal linear
discrete-time descriptor system. In this section, we will study the causality
of a linear discrete-time descriptor system in details, and give some useful
geometric characterization of causality.
We will fix E and consider LA = L as a function of A. Let Q0 = φ(0 : 1)
corresponds to A and Q∞ = φ(1 : 0) corresponds to E in P. Note that
Q∞ ∈ W.
Recall that
n = LA · W =
∑
P∈LA∩W
IP (LA,W),
where IP denoted the intersection multiplicities.
Let χA(u, v) := det(uE + vA). It’s a homogeneous polynomial of degree
n in u, v. We may write
χA(u, v) = anu
n + an−1u
n−1v + ... + a0v
n.
We have
χA(λ) := det(λE −A) = χ(λ,−1) = anλ
n − an−1λ
n−1 + · · · + (−1)na0.
We define
q(A) := degλ χ(λ) = max{j|aj 6= 0}.
Proposition 5.1. Suppose that (E,A) is regular, i.e. LA 6⊂ W. Let
I(LA) := IQ∞(LA,W), then we have I(LA) + q(LA) = n.
Proof. We have
IQ∞(LA,W) = ordu(a0u
n + a1u
n−1 + ... + an) = n− q(A).

We would like to define another invariant, r(LA) := {r|LA ⊂ Wr, LA 6⊂
Wr−1}. This implies in particular that there is (u : v) such that uE + vA
has rank = r(LA). Let r := rank(E), then clearly r ≤ r(LA).
Proposition 5.2. q(LA) ≤ r := rank(E).
Proof. This can been seen by considering the Weierstrass form. 
Proposition 5.3. There exists A ∈ P− {E} such that q(LA) = r.
Proof. There are non-singular matrices P1, P2 such that
E′ := P−11 EP
−1
2 =
(
Ir 0
0 0
)
.
We pick A such that
A′ := P−11 AP
−1
2 =
(
0 0
0 In−r
)
.
Then we have
χA(u, v) = det(P1P2) det(uA
′ + vE′) = det(P1P2)u
n−rvr.
It follows that q(LA) = r. 
11
with w :=
(
A′2z
′
0
)
. Then we have Ex = 0 and 0 6= P1w = Ax = Ey ∈
A ker E ∩ imE, which contradicting the hypothesise that A ker E∩ imE = 0.
1 ⇒ 2. Let (E ′, A′) be defined as in (6). Let E ′i be defined for (E
′A′)
as Ei for (E,A). It is easy to see that E
′
1 = {
(
0
y
)
|y ∈ An−r}. Let
z :=
(
z1
z2
)
∈ E ′2. Then E
′z =
(
z1
0
)
= A′
(
0
y
)
=
(
A′2y
A′4y
)
for
some y. Since A′4 is non-singular, y = 0. This implies z1 = 0, that is,
z =
(
0
z2
)
∈ E ′1. This proves that E
′
2 = E
′
1.
2 ⇒ 3. The case ind(E,A) = 0 is trivial. Suppose that ind(E,A) = 1.
Let z ∈ A kerE ∩ imE. Then there exist x and y, with Ex = 0, such that
z = Ax = Ey. We then have y ∈ E−1(A ker E) = E2 = E1 = kerE. Thus
z = 0.

As an immediate application of the above theorem, the following state-
ment gives an equivalent condition for causality of a regular pencil in terms
of its Weierstrass canonical form.
Corollary 5.9. Suppose that (E,A) is regular. Then (E,A) is causal if
and only if the nilpotent matrix N in the Weierstrass canonical form (2) of
(E,A) is void or precisely the zero matrix.
Proof. This is an easy consequence of Theorem 3.22 
Before ending this section, we shall characterize the causality of (A∗, E∗).
Here, we take k = C. We first give a preliminary lemma.
Lemma 5.10. (E∗ ker A∗)⊥ = E−1(imA).
Proof. Let x ∈ (E∗ ker A∗)⊥. Then < Ex, y >=< x,E∗y >= 0 for any
y ∈ ker A∗. Thus Ex ∈ (ker A∗)⊥ = imA. Equivalently, x ∈ E−1(imA).
On the other hand, suppose z ∈ E−1(imA) = E−1((ker A∗)⊥). Then Ez ∈
(ker A∗)⊥. Thus < Ez,w >=< z,E∗w >= 0 for all w ∈ ker A∗. Therefore,
z ∈ (E∗ kerA∗)⊥. 
Theorem 5.11. Suppose that (E,A) is regular. Then (A∗, E∗) is causal if
and only if E−1(imA) + ker A = An.
Proof. First, we note that (E,A) is regular if and only if (A∗, E∗) is regular.
By Theorem 5.8, (A∗, E∗) is causal if and only if E∗ ker A∗ ∩ imA∗ = 0.
Taking perp, we have that (A∗, E∗) is causal if and only if (E∗ kerA∗)⊥ +
ker A = An. The assertion follows immediately by Lemma 5.10. 
6. Feedback Regularizability
In this section, we discuss the following problem: Given E,A,B, how can
we vary a parameter t ∈ R such that (E,A + tB) is regular.
Proposition 6.1. Fix E, and consider LA and LB corresponding the the
pair (E,A) and (E,B). We distinguish the following cases:

  I was invited to attend the conference “Algebraic Geometry and Complex 
Dynamics” held in National University of Singapore in January of 2011. The 
conference was organized by Prof. De-Qi Zhang and was held from Jan 4-Jan 7. Due 
to my teaching duty, I can only make the trip from Jan 5 to Jan 8. I gave a one-hour 
talk on Jan 7 with title “Kodaira dimension of irregular varieties”. The talk was base 
on my recent joint work with Christopher Hacon ( Univ. Utah). In this joint work, to 
appear in the prestigious journal Invent.Math., we settle the long standing Ueno’s 
conjecture on varieties with Kodaira dimension zero. We started working on this 
conjecture more than ten years ago and finally worked it out thanks to the recent 
development of the Fourier-Mukai transform and minimal model program.  
 
  During the conference, I have chance to meet many leading experts in algebraic 
geometry including Yujiro Kawamata, Akira Fujiki, Jun-Muk Hwang. We also have 
some more brief discussion for the organization for the upcoming conference 
“Algebraic Geometry in East Asia” to be held in Taipei in November, 2011.  
 
  Some personal comment is that the facility of NUS still ok but seems getting 
old-fashioned. I have the impression that they have very nice facilities when I first 
visit NUS about 10 years ago. However, it seems little improvement was made during 
the past decade. Therefore, I think it is necessary to reexamine the infrastructure and 
facilities every 10 years or so.  
 
  I’m grateful to NSC for the support of this trip. I think this conference is a very 
successful one and we successfully increase the interaction between algebraic 
geometers in the nearby countries.
