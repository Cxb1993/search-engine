Abstract 
A case study is presented to evaluate the image of 
service quality, customer satisfaction from the 
perspective of healthcare services. The study focuses on 
listening to the voice of patient (VOP), by using NUD* 
IST (N6) software for code-based inquiry and searching 
qualitative data. The findings, reflecting strengths and 
weaknesses attributes of healthcare service quality, are 
relevant to issues concerning healthcare in Taiwan. A 
concept map for patients’ satisfaction about service 
quality process was depicted. Customer attributes is 
illustrated by the application of Kano’s model of how 
customer satisfaction behaves and the relationship 
between customer satisfaction and the quality of 
healthcare services is analyzed.  The results reveal that 
patients pay most attention on “physician care”, and 
have less concern with “hospital costs”. Healthcare 
managers need strategies to train physicians’ and 
nurses’ communication skills in order to enhance 
customer satisfaction.    
Keywords: Customer satisfaction, Healthcare service 
quality, Kano’s model, Voice of Patient 
1. Introduction 
1Today, in an effort to attract customers and win 
contracts, healthcare services in Taiwan are 
aggressively marketing themselves by designing new 
services, promoting the services more intensely and 
crafting pricing strategies that made flexibility in order 
to attract customers. Demands of high quality of 
healthcare service have brought up in customers’ mind. 
Since the conduction of national health insurance and 
                                                 
 
recent improving plans of health insurance payment, 
competition of healthcare service becomes fiercer day 
by day. Recently, the development of marketing 
strategy of healthcare is changing from customer 
oriented to relationship oriented. Customer centricity is 
the pivotal strategic issue in healthcare business 
relationship development. Hospitals can not merely 
care medical effect, but also should focus on 
influencing factors of quality to increase customer 
satisfaction and earn customers' loyalty. By analyzing 
the customer satisfaction and understanding the 
weakness, opportunities and threats of healthcare 
service, it would enhance the ability to attract 
customers. Therefore, how to arrange the resource for 
improving quality of healthcare service and customer 
satisfaction has become an urgent task for the operation 
of hospitals.  
The development of the healthcare industry in 
Taiwan could be categorized into three periods: 
establishment, expansion and control. Each of their 
characteristics and competition of healthcare market 
development are listed in Table 1 [37]. 
A lot of efforts were made to keep the equality 
and accessibility by the Taiwan government in last ten 
years. However, the efforts were broken by fierce 
competition and the new rule of lump sum payment. 
According to the report, more than 100 hospitals are on 
the verge of out of business [60]. Therefore, how to 
gain competitive advantage by enhance operating 
strategies is a crucial issue to business success. 
Hauser and Clausing [23] found that after 
formulating the product requirements from different 
type of customers, the voice of customers is of prime 
important. The voice of customer is a directly 
description of the problem to be solved from the 
customer’s point of view. Today, most healthcare 
service has shifted their marketing orientation from the 
product concept to a market concept that based on 
patients’ oriented. Souba, et al. [51] revealed that most 
patients and referring physicians believe their products 
(e.g. a surgical procedure) are excellent, but their 
service offering (e.g. communication and friendliness) 
need improvement. Thus, for better understanding what 
patients’ needs and analyzing their wants to achieve 
their satisfaction can be achieved by listening to the 
voice of patients (VOP). If the physicians can pay more 
attention to the voice of patients, then events of 
misunderstanding of patients will be reduced, such as 
took inappropriate drug dosages, or ate the wrong food 
[52]. 
2.2 Kano’s Model 
Many researchers have described the useful 
diagram of Kano’s model for attributing customer’s 
needs and how a given service feature or attribute 
behave in terms of customer satisfaction [4, 9, 11, 14, 
28, 32, 33, 36, 39, 57]. von Dran et al. [60] applied 
Kano's Model of quality to develop a conceptual 
framework for investigating features in the web 
environment that satisfy basic, performance, and 
excitement needs of potential customers. von Dran and 
Zhang [58] revised and developed a theoretical model 
for evaluating website quality from a user/customer 
satisfaction perspective in 2001. Pawitra and Tan [46, 
54] integrated approach involving SERVQUAL, 
Kano’s model, and Quality Function Deployment to 
evaluate the image of Singapore from Indonesian 
tourists’ perspective. Wu [61] integrated Kano’s model 
and a traditional survey to fulfill customer requirements 
from both psychological and numerical aspects. 
Conklin et al. [12] utilized Shapely value and attributed 
risk techniques to identify priorities of key drivers of 
customer satisfaction, or key dissatisfiers and key 
enhancers on the relationship between product quality 
and customer satisfaction. 
The Kano’s model provides an effective approach 
to categorize customer characteristics, establish the 
individual product features for customer’ satisfaction 
and create the appropriate prerequisite for product 
development activities [38]. Knowledge of Kano’s 
ideas of customer satisfaction can be optimal combined 
with quality function deployment. The prerequisite is to 
identify customer needs and their priorities [18]. The 
Kano method provides usefulness in trade-off situations 
in the product development processes. The function of 
Kano’s model is the belief that the product criteria 
which have the great influence on the customer’s 
satisfaction can be distinguished. [38] Thus, marketing 
people, design engineers and manufacturing staff 
should work hard together from the time a product is 
first imaged [23]. 
The usefulness of Kano’s model has barely been 
introduced into health care services [33, 41]. Jan′e and 
Domi′nguez [28] applied Kano’s model to explore how 
patient satisfaction behave and briefly analyzed the 
characteristics and advantage of methods used to assess 
patient satisfaction. They found that physician provides 
the patient with written treatment and good 
communication would increase patient satisfaction. On 
the other hand, the absence of the same quality attribute 
would lead to dissatisfaction. This situation would be 
similar to the Kano’s one-dimensional quality attributes.  
Kano et al. [31] have developed a useful diagram 
for characterizing customer’s requirements. According 
to the Kano model, a customer’s attributes can be 
effective categorized into different types. Kano et al. 
[31] classify the quality attributes into six categories, 
described bellow: 
 Attractive quality attributes: A certain quality 
attribute can originate great satisfaction in the 
customer. However, the absence of the same 
quality attribute does not originate dissatisfaction.   
 Must be quality attributes: The customer will not 
be satisfied when the current quality attribute fulfill. 
However, if the product or service does not meet 
the customer’s need, customer will become great 
dissatisfied. 
 One-dimensional quality attributes: The customer 
satisfaction level is directly proportional to the 
certain quality attribute.  
 Indifferent quality attributes: A certain quality 
attribute that presence or absence will not affect 
customer’s satisfaction or dissatisfaction.   
 Reverse quality attributes: The customer will be 
satisfied when the current quality attribute absent 
and dissatisfied when the current quality attribute 
present.  
 Questionable results: Due to misunderstanding or 
misinterpretation of the answers on the survey or 
filling out the error questionnaires, the 
contradictions in the response given from customer 
may happen.    
The three first categories- attractive quality 
attribute, must be quality attribute and one-dimensional 
quality attribute – correspond to the different types of 
quality defined in Kano’s satisfaction behavior model 
(see Figure 1).    
 
 
Figure 1. Kano’s model of customer satisfaction 
According to customer’s answer of pair 
combinations, the customer requirements can be 
classified into different categories. Table 2 shows the 5 
× 5 table which involved different combinations of 
potential answers and the resulting categories.  
Researcher may consider using questionnaires 
with small range of potential answers for drawing up 
the questionnaires [13]. The Kano model was modified 
as 3 × 3 table which was proposed by Jan′e and 
Domi′nguez [28]. Table 3 shows the different 
combinations of potential answers and the resulting 
categories.  
The advantage of using short response scales 
represents an option for developing simpler and less 
extensive questionnaires for more correctly filling out 
questionnaires and attaining a higher response rate in 
surveys [28]. 
The research was conducted in two phases. Phase 
one was the quantitative approaches which used to 
collect and analyze the customer attributes based on 
Kano’s model, service quality introduced into the 
healthcare services and the statistical results of the data 
analysis. Phase two consisted of four personal 
interviews with healthcare service quality and their 
satisfaction. This was done to identify the types of 
service quality available and satisfaction with quality in 
the healthcare services. Based on the logic of multi-
convenience, bill, comfort and cleanliness, nursing care 
and physician care.  Admission and convenience, 
comfort and cleanliness, nursing care and physician 
care were adapted from the measurement defined by 
Carey and Seibert [7] and Kaldenberg [30]. Bill was 
adapted from the measurement defined by Carey and 
Seibert [7] and Javalgi, Rao and Thomas [29].  
Nearly 98 percent of all care is reimbursed under 
Taiwanese National Health Insurance (TNHI) since its 
inception in 1995 and individual medical expense is 
reducing year by year. However, the healthcare cost has 
been rapidly raised and government finance was 
embarrassed in last few years. Therefore, many new 
rules such as the cost-containment mechanism and 
global budgeting system were conducted and hospitals 
can not claim all expenses. For example, TNHI does 
not pay for antacid drugs since October, 2005. Then, 
antipyretics and Analgesics, chlorpheniramine maleate 
and et al. were no longer included in the insurance 
payment since 1996. Moreover, according to National 
Health Insurance Law (revised on May 18, 2005), 
coinsurance for different levels of hospitals was defined. 
For example, if a patient goes to the medical center or 
region hospital but not via the transfer system, the 
coinsurance payment will increase from $6 to $11 US 
dollars. Therefore, the current research likes to 
understand customers’ behavior in “Bill” consciousness. 
3.2 Validity and Reliability of the Survey 
 The content validity for the survey was to 
determine whether the survey was appropriate for 
measuring issues related to patients’ attitudes, level of 
patient attributes by applying the Kano’s model of how 
patient satisfaction or dissatisfaction behaves. Content 
validity testing of the survey was done by a panel 
discussion who served as professors with good 
experience in the field. The reliability appropriate in the 
context is an estimate of the internal consistency, 
homogeneity. The criterion was followed by 
Cronbach’s α statistics to measure the form of 
reliability. Helmstadter [25] suggested of Cronbach’s α 
= 0.5 as a minimum standard for group comparisons 
was a useful guideline. The questions and section 
reliabilities are presented in Table 4.

3.3 Interviews   
It was interviewed one time after the treatment 
period in the hospital A/B. The entire process for each 
interview is approximately 20 minutes. The four cases 
consisted of two cases in the hospital A and two in the 
hospital B. The four cases were found appropriate for 
the survey, willingly gave their time for the interview. 
The interviewed focused on patients’ prior experiences 
with service quality and their feeling about satisfaction.  
During interviews, case study participants were 
encouraged to “think aloud” and provide reasons why 
they selected the physician to make a diagnosis and 
how satisfied are they with the hospital in which they 
select. This “think aloud” protocol for data collection 
was based on Patton [45] methods. According to the 
method of Denzin and Lincoln [17], the researcher 
should interact with each subject by encouraging, 
guiding, questioning, and searching during the 
interviews. Both cases were given the same tasks and 
asked the same questions.   
The interview situations included classification of 
the subject’s meaning by the researcher and reflections 
from the cases. The purpose was to help subjects 
express their ideas more clearly. Some examples are 
described below: 
 What image or characteristic comes to your mind 
when you think the hospital A /B? 
 What aspects of the issue that you expect to 
experience during the treatment in the hospital A 
/B?  
 How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the 
particular type of service? Any experience you, 
your family, or friends may have had.  
 Does the physician respond to the questions that 
were asked from you? Why or why not? It might 
include an individual’s characteristics, such as 
being passive, shy, or emotionless, etc. 
 Why do you think the treatment works? Was this 
not cured before?  
 How did you choose the hospital A /B? What are 
you feeling now? 
 Does the physician provide you with written

The quality attributes considered in the five 
categories of the survey, conducted among patients in 
hospitals A and B, including combine both of patients 
and employees, is displayed in Table 6. The importance 
of various quality attributes was conducted by means 
statistics.  The values of means were used to rank the 
attributes. If two or more attributes had the same 
average degree of importance, the one with a smaller 
deviation was listed first. The viewpoints of hospital 
patient (hospital A and B), all patients, and the 
employees were considered in this analysis. 
Interestingly, the very important attributes in the study 
are “physician care” and “nursing care” is showed in 
Table 6. Furthermore, satisfaction of quality attributes 
was conducted by means statistics. The values showed 
that “nursing care” and “physician care” had the 
strongest influence on satisfaction. Those items of 
quality attribute include PC6, PC5, PC3 and NC6. 
Meanwhile, “Bill” was the indifferent quality attribute, 
including BI1 and BI2, and it didn’t influence 
satisfaction.

Statistical analysis fond that two groups had 
different perceptions regarding the important level of 
several quality attributes. For example, with respect to 
the quality attributes “admission and convenience”, 
“bill” and “comfort and cleanliness”, patients receive 
more attention on “comfort and cleanliness” rare care 
about hospital cost. However, employees paid more 
attention on the attribute “admission and convenience” 
such as “Speed of admission process” and “Nearest to 
convenience” than patients. The fact reveals that time 
for medical care is tide and job loading of employees in 
both hospitals is heavy, too.  
Patients in hospitals A and B are equally 
preferred attributes “physician care”, “admission and 
85% of inpatient services were also paid on the fee-for-
service basis with the other 15% paid on a Diagnosis 
Related Group basis. The hospital payment rate varies 
by the level of hospital (e.g. medical center, regional or 
local community hospital). The Bureau of National 
Health Insurance in Taiwan pays hospital facilitators a 
fixed fee for each patient in their care during a set 
period and requires that the physicians absorb all the 
costs of care. However, the Taiwan’s NHI is facing 
difficulty about budget balance. It is worth to keep eyes 
on the evaluation. From the employees’ point of view, 
the attribute of “Bill” described as “Bill was handled in 
an acceptable manner” and “Less expensive” classify as 
“Reverse” quality attribute. It reveals that employees 
may face larger numbers of patients when the cost is 
low and it will increase their job loading.  Usually, 
according to patients’ minds, it is a special situation 
shopping in hospitals in Taiwan. The quality attribute 
described as “Speed of admissions process” and 
“Courtesy of admissions” are treated as “Reverse” 
quality attributes by employees.  This study showed 
that the working attitude of employees lead to 
unsatisfied with high job loading.  If the speed is faster 
or the courtesy is better, they need to pay more 
attention on their job. 
5.2 Section II-Qualitative Data Findings 
and Discussion 
Case study participants and their beliefs and 
attitudes about service quality and their satisfaction 
from the perspective of healthcare services are 
described in this section. 
Following the processes illustrated in Figure 2, 
based on results of the survey, four patients from two 
hospitals were selected to participate in the case study. 
The pseudonyms of Carrie, Jane, John and Anna were 
given to the respondents. The hospital A is one of 
premier public medical center and was established in 
1980. It has 25 clinic departments, 469 physicians, and 
1083 hospital beds. In the past ten years, it trains 
talented person regardless of in clinical, the teaching, as 
well as the foundation or the clinical medicine research 
and has extremely outstanding performance. The 
patients with advanced appointment can pay after their 
visits and all clinics are computerized—the doctor 
prescribes on the computer and the pharmacy fills the 
prescription through the computer system. The Hospital 
A aims to be the best medical care center for the 
general public and the best teaching, research, as well 
as work environment for medical professionals. 
The hospital, B, is a medium-sized, decades-old 
private regional hospital, providing citizens with a 
variety of health care services. There are five main 
departments, 117 doctors, and 620 sickbeds. 
Meanwhile, hospital B is a regional teaching hospital 
through evaluated by Department of Health (DOH) and 
Ministry of Education. The hospital B future will face 
taking the heavy sickness disease and the urgent 
medical service as the management object. Because 
hospital B is located in the urban, its transportation is 
convenient. If the patient had heavy sickness disease or 
needed emergency medical treatment, he/she can be 
first delivered to hospital B for fast handling. That is an 
important characteristics of Hospital B. 
There were two participants in the Hospital A. 
Carrie, 45-year old Taiwanese housekeeper, was 
willing to be observed and interviewed. Based on her 
performance during treatment, Carrie was a talkative 
and happy patient in the hospital A. Also, she likes to 
share her ideas with her friends or relatives who came 
with her during the treatment. She would ask questions 
in treatment immediately if she did not understand a 
problem or concept. Her physician is from the 
Gastroenterology department. He is very patient to hear 
and explain her questions. 
Jane, 28-year old teacher, was one of the other 
participants in the hospital when she was visiting the 
Department of Family Medicine. A. Jane was 
aggressive patient in the hospital A. According to her 
performance in diagnosis treatment, Jane always asked 
questions about her condition and how can she treat 
about it. Her physician was kind and affectionate, but 
very serious.  
John, 32-year old engineer and one of the 
participants in the hospital B, does not care about how 
to treat his illness. In his minds, physician has the duty 
to treat him well because of physician’s responsibility. 
He believes that if he takes the medicine, he should 
become healthy very soon. He came to the hospital to 
visit Department of Otolaryngology. His physician is 
very busy and didn’t pay attention to the patients very 
well. 
Anna, 20-year old student, was one of the other 
participants in the hospital B. Unlike Carrie, Anna was 
a quiet and shy patient during treatment in department 
of Orthopaedics. According to her responses on the 
survey, she would ask questions during the treatment if 
she did not understand a problem. However, based on 
interviewing with her physician, she did not ask any 
questions during the treatment. Anna also did not like 
to participate in medical knowledge trainings, which 
led to an investigation of why. Her physician is old and 
has no smile on his face, but is a famous medical doctor. 
5.2.1 Overall image of Healthcare service as 
a Family 
Carrie and Jane cared about the medical staff 
quality (e.g. nursing care, physician care and good 
surroundings) is more important than nearest to 
home/convenience or cost of care. In their mind, 
medical staff (specifically physician) is the other 
important people as well as relative because of trusting 
them, patient with his/her patients during treatment. 
Carrie mentioned in interviews that, when she finally 
understood why she got sick and became well, “it was a 
really neat feeling. Thanks God.” Jane enjoys the 
surrounding of hospital and this is the reason why she 
never went to other hospital when she needs to.  
John’s philosophy was to keep everything simple. 
He pays more expectations on the physician and 
nursing care. He believes that physician/nurse attitudes 
to be the most importance as hospital choice factors. He 
mentioned that physician/nurse has to treat his/her 
patients like family. Employees should focus on an 
individual patient recovering his/her disease by 
himself/herself. He felt that patient should understand 
why they got sick on colds or special diseases, then 
they could learn to prevent and “never forget.” 
relationship to provide high quality service for enticing 
more customers to visit and recommend. 
By encouraging employees focus on serving the 
patient’s need, a positive image on patients’ minds will 
be improved. The result is coherent with the research of 
Herzlinger [26] which proposed that the health-care 
system of the future will be patient-focused rather than 
provider-focused. Improving the service quality has 
become the most important strategy for healthcare 
systems. Healthcare managers should realize that 
customers’ perspective of the level of 
satisfaction/dissatisfaction of service quality is 
important, even more than how care providers view. 
The key to providing right way for encasing patients’ 
satisfaction is to understand patient needs and try to 
exceed his/her expectation.  
Meanwhile, the results of the research indicate 
the fruitfulness of integrating Kano’s model and 
qualitative research for theoretical benefits. Healthcare 
managers should be able to evaluate attributes 
performance of hospitals, provide detailed information 
on patient satisfaction, and develop more attributes 
which are highly attractive to their patients. 
6.2 Contributions 
The important contribution of this research is to 
remind hospitals’ internal employee (e.g. decision 
maker, employees and et. al.) to be aware that there are 
significant differences between employees and patients 
regarding quality attributes. Managers of hospitals 
should review the results and listen to the voice of 
customers more. Customers’ need changed rapidly, not 
only for commercial company but also for hospitals. 
Most researches have applied Kano’s model to describe 
the relationship between customers need and products 
attributes. Although most researches have applied 
Kano’s model to describe the relationship between 
customers’ need and products’ attributes. But they were 
still unclear about specific features between customer 
satisfaction and the quality of services [28] or exceed 
customer expectations. The current research combined 
Kano’s model and qualitative research to evaluate the 
importance and satisfaction of health care service 
quality from customers’ point of view. Managers of 
hospitals have to understand what customers need. The 
steps described here are practical methods for 
improving and upgrading health care service quality.  
Furthermore, the integrated approach applied in 
the research could be used for other hospitals which are 
reviewing their strategies for improving service quality 
in the country. The model developed in the research 
could enable them not only to evaluate their 
weaknesses and strengths, but also to refine their 
strategies for attracting more customers.
