Applying the Divergence theorem, adapting the 
backward time differencing scheme and 
keeping the pressure fixed at the current time 
level n, the momentum and temperature 
equations can be discretized as:

where the superscript “*” represents the

V∆  is the volume of the considered cell; t∆  is 
the time increment.  The vector of conserved 
variables is defined as [ ]TvuQ θ= .  The 
surface integral of inviscid fluxes invR , the 
pressure flux PR , the viscous fluxes visR  and 
the source term H will be defined later.  The 
constants are 1c =1.5, 2c =2 and 3c =0.5 for 
the second-order accurate backward

time-accurate computations, the temperature 
equation alone in Eq. (2) is solved with *θ  
being replaced by 1+nθ , and ∗vv  and np  by 
the latest 1nv +v  and 1+np .  Equations (2) to (4) 
and the last temperature update constitute the 
implicit pressure correction method used in this 
work. 
3 Finite-Volume Method 
A cell-centered finite volume method on 
unstructured Cartesian grid is developed in this 
work.  The flow variables are stored at the 
center of the cell volume.  The flow states at a 
cell vertex are obtained by averaging the 
surrounding center values with the weighting 
constant proportional to the inverse of the 
distance to the particular center.  The variable 
gradients at the cell center are obtained by 
differencing the vertex values for the particular 
cell.  The left and right variable states at a 
cell-face center are linearly reconstructed from 
the neighboring center values using the 
estimated gradient information.  The mean 
variable states at the cell-face centers are 
obtained by a simple average: 
)(5.0 Rf

f QQQ +=   (5) 
where the subscript f  represents the face 
index 21j /±  or 21k /± ; the superscripts 
M, L and R represent the mean, left and right 
states of face f.  The inviscid flux integral

velocity distribution inside the body.  Under 
this assumption, the pressure field inside the 
body satisfies the same governing equation as 
outside, and Eq. (4) can be applied to the entire 
grid domain regardless of the cell type.  
For Dirichlet boundary conditions, a 
2-point stencil reconstruction model based on 
the ghost cell’s projection point and image 
point is developed in Pan and Shen [4].  For a 
ghost cell center, its projection point on the 
boundary surface is the point where the 
Dirichlet boundary condition is to be enforced.  
Along the surface normal direction passing 
through the projection point, the image point of 
a ghost cell is at a fixed normal distance δ  
into the flow domain, as shown in Fig. 1.  The 
choice of δ  is arbitrary, here we take 
minx∆= 2δ  in 2D and minx∆= 3δ  in 3D 
problems, where minx∆  is the minimum 
Cartesian cell length in the mesh.  This chosen 
δ  ensures that the image point is enclosed by 
four (eight in 3D) fluid cell centers forming a 
square (cubic in 3D) contour close to but 
untouched by the body surface.  The variable 
at the image point imageQ  can be obtained by a 
bi-linear interpolation using the center values 
enclosing the image point.  With the given 
Dirichlet boundary value projQ , the ghost cell 
values can be extrapolated as 
projghost
projimage
projghost rr
QQ
QQ vv −−−= δ (15) 
where ghostr
v  and projr
v  are the position vector 
of the ghost center and the projection point, 
respectively.  The ghost cell variable ghostQ  
in Eq. (15) implicitly satisfies the Dirichlet 
boundary condition at the projection point on 
the immersed surface.   
The linear reconstruction model described 
above is quite simple, and can be applied to 3D 
problems in a straightforward manner.  The 
simplicity of the model is attributed to the 
choice of a constant normal distance δ  for all 
image points.  If we choose a shorter δ , the 
stencil for the interpolation of imageQ  will vary, 
making the scheme complicate.  If we choose 
a longer δ , the flow reconstruction in Eq. (15) 
will be inaccurate for the flow in the vicinity of 
the immersed boundary.  Furthermore, the 
current choice of δ  ensures that 
projghost rr
vv −>δ  in Eq. (15), and thus avoids 
the unstable situation when some stencil point 
gets too close to the boundary surface. 
In the case of Neumann boundary condition 
with a given normal gradient proj)n

∂  at the 
projection point, a simple extrapolation to 
obtain the ghost cell values is

But Eq. (16) contains no information about 
the location of the projection point, or 
equivalently the body surface.  By our 
experience Eq. (16) yields only first-order 
solution accuracy.  To improve solution 
accuracy, a second-order reconstruction 
polynomial based on the same 2-point stencil as 
in Fig. 1 is developed here.  Two conditions 
for the polynomial already exist: the given 
Neumann condition proj)n

Q( ∂
∂  is described as 
follows.  Let the Cartesian axes passing 
through the image point intersect the square 
contour connecting the four enclosing centers 
at point A and B on the x-axis, and C and D on 
the y-axis.  The variable values at point A, B, 
C and D can be obtained easily by linear 
interpolations using the four enclosing center 
values.  They are differenced to obtain the 
gradient vector approximation at the image 
point, which in turn is multiplied by nˆ  to 
obtain image)n
Q( ∂
∂ .  With three known 
conditions, the ghost cell values under 
Neumann boundary condition are obtained by a 
2-point reconstruction as:

is handled by Eq. (17).   
A sequence of regular Cartesian grids, with 
mesh size ranging from 3232 ×  to 256256 × , 
is applied in the convergence test.  The 
converged solution on the finest mesh is used 
as the reference solution.  The flow solutions 
at cell vertices inside a square of length 0.8 
enclosing the cylinder, as indicated by the 
dashed square in Fig. 2, are compared with the 
reference solution.  For an isothermal cylinder, 
the maximum norms of error in velocity, 
pressure and temperature on various grids are 
plotted against cell lengths in Fig. 3.  For 
convenience, curves showing first-order and 
second-order convergences are also shown in 
the figure.  It is obvious that the spatial 
accuracy of the current method for Dirichlet 
conditions is second order in maximum norms 
on all indicated variables.  Although not 
shown here, 1L  and 2L  norms on these 
variables are also second-order accurate. 
For an isoflux cylinder with Neumann 
boundary condition for temperature on the 
cylinder, Fig 4 shows 1L , 2L  and maximum 
norms of temperature error on various grids.  
The 1L  norm and 2L  norm in the figure are 
obviously second-order accurate.  The 
maximum norm has an average order about 
1.44, which is less than second order.  This 
result is considered satisfactory, because if the 
simple ghost cell treatment of Eq. (16) for 
isoflux cylinder has been adapted, the average 
slope for all three norms in temperature error 
would be roughly one.  Thus, Fig. 3b has 
indicated the gain in solution accuracy when Eq. 
(17) is adapted for Neumann boundary 
condition. 
8. Forced Convection Over A Cylinder 
The steady and unsteady flows over a 
circular cylinder of diameter D=1 at Re=10, 20, 
40, 100, 120 and 200 are computed on a 
Cartesian grid with local refinement.  The 
outer boundaries are 30 diameters away from 
the cylinder.  The grid is locally refined 
around the cylinder to have 384 ghost cells and 
620 ghost vertices, while the total number of 
terminal cells is only 31120.  This high grid 
resolution around the cylinder is used here only 
to demonstrate the advantage of local 
refinement, because it is almost impossible to 
obtain such a high grid resolution on a regular 
Cartesian over the same computational domain.  
The free stream condition is set to the inflow 
boundary and the two side boundaries.  The 
downstream boundary uses the upwind 
differenced equation of 
0=∂∂+∂∂ )x/Q(U)t/Q( n , where nU  is the 
computed normal outflow velocity at the 
boundary.  The free stream temperature is 
0=∞θ . 
For both the isothermal and the isoflux 
cylinders, the local Nusselt number on cylinder 
surface is defined as HD/k, where H is the local 
heat transfer coefficient, k is the thermal 
conductivity.  For an isothermal cylinder with 
a cylinder temperature 1=cylθ , the local 
Nusselt number on the cylinder is

over the cylinder is computed by  
∑∑ ∆∆= surface local

where the summation is done on all boundary 
surface segments of the body.   
For the steady cases of Re=10, 20 and 40, 
the Euler implicit method is used with a time 
step 50.t =∆ .  This amounts to a maximum 
CFL number around 20 in the steady state, and 
it may exceed 80 in transient.  For such high 
CFL numbers, the implicit time integration and 
multigrid methods described above are 
essential for the stability of the solution process.  
For convenience, one multigrid V cycle going 
through the coarse grids is counted as 
equivalent to one ALU relaxation step on the 
finest grid.  The typical convergence history 
for steady state computations is shown in Fig. 5, 
taking Re=20 case as an example.  The

I. Introduction 
The ghost cell method belongs to the general category of immersed boundary methods [1-8] 
that is capable of handling arbitrary immersed bodies on Cartesian meshes.  In the original 
immersed boundary method [1], forces exerted on the fluid at the fluid-body interface by the 
immersed elastic bodies are added to the governing equations, and numerically distributed to the 
fluid cells around the interface using a discrete Delta function.  In the direct-forcing approach [2], 
momentum forcing terms representing the effects of solid body are constructed in the frame work of 
discretized equations in such a way that the variable values of the fluid cells neighboring the 
fluid-body interface are obtained by a local flow reconstruction rather than by the computation of 
conservation laws.  In the Ghost Cell approach [3,4], the direct-forcing treatment is applied to the 
cells (ghost cells) inside the solid body with at least one fluid cell as its neighbor.  The ghost cell 
values are determined in such a way that the appropriate solid wall boundary conditions are 
implicitly satisfied on the designated location of the body surface.  Traditionally [3] the mirror 
image of a ghost cell symmetric to the body surface is used to evaluate ghost cell values.  In [4] 
the image point of a ghost cell is defined at a fixed distance from the interface to ensure both 
accuracy and stability.  In this paper, the method is further developed to handle both the Dirichlet 
type and the Neumann type boundary condition for the heat equation.

body are categorized as fluid cells.  All cells whose center is covered by the immersed body are 
body cells.  Those body cells neighboring to at least one fluid cell are ghost cells.  The ghost cell 
values are to be determined by a local flow reconstruction in the region near the immersed boundary.  
For a ghost cell center, its projection point on the boundary surface, as shown in Fig. 1, is the point 
where the no-slip condition is to be enforced implicitly.  For Dirichlet boundary condition, the 
variable value projQ  at the projection point is assumed known.  Along the surface normal 
direction passing through the ghost cell center and its projection point, the image point of the ghost 
cell center is defined as the point a distance δ  away from the body surface, as shown in Fig. 1.  
The choice of δ  is artificial, and in this work we take minx∆= 2δ  in 2D problems where 
minx∆  is the minimum Cartesian cell length in the vicinity of the boundary surface.  This choice 
of δ  ensures that the image point is enclosed by four fluid cell centers forming a square region 
close to but untouched by the body surface.  The variables at the image point can be obtained 
easily by a bilinear interpolation using the variable values of the four enclosing fluid centers.  The 
variable gradient along the surface normal passing through the projection point can then be 
estimated by

Dirichlet boundary condition at the projection point on the cylinder surface.  In the case of 
Neumann boundary condition with a given normal gradient n/Q ∂∂ , the variable value at ghost 
cell center, ghostQ  is extrapolated by

For consistency, the vertices of ghost cells that are covered by the body surface, or ghost vertices, 
should also be treated by the same reconstruction described above.   
The linear reconstruction model described above is quite simple, and can be extended to 3D 
problems in a straightforward manner, with a choice of minx∆= 3δ  in 3D.  The simplicity of the 
  
around the cylinder to have 384 ghost cells and 620 ghost vertices, while the total number of 
terminal cells is only 31120.  The free stream condition is set to the inflow boundary and the two 
side boundaries.  The downstream boundary follows the upwind differenced equation of 
0)/()/( =∂∂+∂∂ xQUtQ n , where nU  is the computed normal outflow velocity at the boundary.    
For the steady cases of Re=40, the Euler implicit method is used with a time step of 5.0=∆t .  
This amounts to a maximum CFL number around 20 in the steady state, and the maximum CFL 
may exceed 80 in transient.  The steady state residual for fluid cells dropped 4 orders of magnitude 
in less than 500 steps.  The computed streamlines and temperature contours for Re=40 case are 
plotted in Fig. 5.  For convenience, the cylinder surface is also displayed in the figure.  A 
separation bubble behind the cylinder is clear.  The streamlines around the cylinder are smooth, 
indicating that the ghost cell treatment has captured the immersed boundary on the refined Cartesian 
grid.  The pressure coefficient on the immersed boundary segment center is interpolated using the 
surrounding cell-vertex values and plotted in Fig. 6.  The data from Fornberg [9] are also included 
for comparison.  The two results generally agree with each other very well, but the current 
computation predicted a slightly lower surface pressure distribution on the leeward surface.   
Table 1 lists the wake length (Lw) normalized by the diameter (d), the computed lift coefficient (Cl), 
drag coefficient (Cd) and the average Nusselt number (Nu).  The comparison with the work of 
others is generally satisfactory.   The curve fit of experimental data for average Nusselt number in 
Holman [10] is used as reference data.  The difference between the computed Nu and the 
experimental curve fit is less than 3%. .  
For the unsteady vortex shedding behind a cylinder at Re=100, the second-order backward 
time differencing scheme is used with 1.0=∆t .  The flow asymmetry started to build up at 
around 700 steps after the impulsive start.  The asymmetry evolved into a periodic vortex shedding 
after 1200 steps.  The time history of lift and drag coefficient is shown in Fig. 7.  The computed 
Strauhal number St, the averaged drag coefficient dC  and the amplitude of lift coefficient lC  and 
the averaged Nusselt number Nu are listed in Table 1.  As one can see that the comparison with 
published data is generally satisfactory.  
VII. Conclusions 
In this paper we developed a simple and effective Ghost Cell method to solve incompressible 
flows with heat transfer over arbitrary immersed bodies.  For the Dirichlet boundary condition for 
velocity and temperature on cylinder surface, the scheme is second-order accurate for all norms of 
error in all variables.  For the Neumann boundary condition of constant heat flux over the cylinder 
surface, the scheme is only first order accurate.  It is expected that second order accuracy for the
