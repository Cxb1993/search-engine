Task I 
Device mismatch and its temperature 
dependence are becoming increasingly 
important because they may limit the 
achievable accuracy in analog applications and 
mixed-mode integrated circuits [5]-[7]. 
Regarding the temperature dependence of 
MOSFET mismatching properties, Andricciola 
et al. [6] have shown that as temperature 
decreases, both the threshold voltage 
mismatch (Vth) and the normalized current 
factor mismatch (σ(Δβ)/β) increase. In 
addition, Mennillo et al. [7] have suggested 
that the enhanced current factor mismatch as 
temperature decreases can be attributed to the 
increased Coulombic scattering. As strained-
silicon is widely used in state-of-the-art 
CMOS technologies [8]-[10], however, the 
impact of strain on the temperature 
dependence of mismatching properties for 
nanoscale transistors is rarely known and 
merits investigation.  
In this work, we examine the drain 
current mismatch of uniaxially-strained 
pMOSFETs under various temperatures and 
report our findings on the intrinsic effect of 
uniaxial strain. 
 
Task II 
Strain technology has been considered 
as a key process knob for advanced CMOS 
technologies [11]. It is known that strain can 
improve phonon-scattering limited mobility 
(PH) by reducing intervalley phonon 
scatterings and effective conduction mass [12]. 
Whether strain can improve the surface-
roughness limited mobility (SR) is still not 
clear and demands more experimental 
investigations. Recently, the biaxial strain 
dependence of SR has been examined by 
Bonno et al. [13] and Zhao et al. [14]. These 
studies have shown that SR has strong strain 
sensitivity for both NFETs and PFETs due to 
surface morphology engineering with biaxial 
strain. The temperature dependences of hole 
mobility by mechanical uniaxial strain [15] 
and process-induced uniaxial strain [16] have 
also been studied experimentally. However, 
the temperature range was higher than 87 K, 
and the phonon scattering mechanism was not 
fully suppressed. To investigate the uniaxial 
strain dependence of surface roughness 
mobility, it is necessary to extract mobility 
with temperature down to 20 K to suppress the 
phonon scattering mechanism.  
In this work, we report our new findings 
on the impact of process-induced uniaxial 
strain on the SR of short-channel pMOSFETs 
with temperature down to 20 K.  
 
Task III 
Germanium as a channel material has 
been proposed to enable the mobility scaling 
for CMOS devices. As the higher permittivity 
makes Ge more susceptible to short-channel 
effects (SCEs), ultra-thin-body (UTB) Ge-on-
Insulator (GeOI) structure with thin buried 
oxide (BOX) has been suggested to improve 
the electrostatic integrity [17][18]. With the 
scaling of channel thickness, the quantum-
confinement effect may become significant 
and impact the SCE of scaled UTB devices. 
Using density gradient model [19], Omura et 
al. [20] have observed increased threshold 
voltage (Vth) roll-off due to quantum 
confinement in UTB Si-on-insulator (SOI) 
devices. Whether there exists any difference 
between GeOI and SOI devices regarding the 
impact of quantum confinement on SCEs is 
not clearly known and merits investigation. 
In this work, we tackle the problem 
using an analytically derived solution of 
Schrödinger equation verified with TCAD 
simulation. We report our new findings for 
UTB GeOI MOSFETs with thin BOX. The 
theoretical model provides us a physical and 
efficient method to explore the impact of 
quantum-confinement effect. 
 
 4 
saturation region, opposite to the unstrained 
case, the drain current mismatch of the 
compressively-strained device decreases with 
temperature. The underlying mechanism is the 
larger temperature sensitivity of carrier 
mobility for the strained device. 
 
2. Experimental Investigation of Surface-
Roughness Limited Mobility in Uniaxial 
Strained MOSFETs [3]  
This work investigates the impact of 
process-induced uniaxial strain on the surface-
roughness limited mobility, SR, of short-
channel pMOSFETs. Fig. 7 shows the 
measured carrier mobility versus vertical 
electric field (EEFF) with various temperatures. 
It can be seen that, under high EEFF, the 
mobility tends to increase as the temperature 
decreases due to suppressed phonon scattering. 
At a temperature lower than 60 K, the mobility 
at high EEFF saturates because the phonon 
scattering mechanism is fully suppressed. In 
other words, the mobility at high EEFF within 
this temperature range can be viewed as the 
surface-roughness limited mobility. 
Fig. 8 shows the extracted carrier 
mobility versus temperature at EEFF = 1.6 
MV/cm for various stressors. It can be seen 
that the compressive uniaxial strain results in a 
significant mobility enhancement due to band 
engineering and carrier repopulations [10]. In 
addition, SR dominates the total mobility for 
temperature < 60 K for all kinds of stressors. 
 Fig. 9 shows the mobility enhancement 
percentage (Δ/) versus temperature with 
compressive and tensile stressors. As the 
temperature decreases, it can be observed that 
the mobility enhancement increases and 
saturates at temperature < 60 K where surface 
roughness scattering dominates. It indicates 
that SR has stronger stress sensitivity than the 
phonon-scattering limited mobility, PH. 
Furthermore, the SR enhancement tends to 
saturate and shows little sensitivity to 
temperature.  
It is worth noting that our experimental 
results are consistent with the reported results 
by simulations [15][25][26]. Specifically, it 
was reported in [25] that the scattering rate 
with interfacial roughness can be reduced by 
smoother interfaces in biaxial strained NFETs. 
In addition, the atomic scale model in [26] also 
indicated weaker surface scattering potential in 
strained Si due to the nature of primitive 
defects. For the uniaxially strained PFET case, 
it is plausible that the lighter effective 
conduction mass [5] induced by compressive 
strain may result in the SR enhancement.  
Fig. 10 shows the extracted carrier 
mobility versus effective vertical electric field 
(EEFF) for neutral and compressive stressors at 
20 K. Within this temperature range, both the 
Coulomb scattering and surface roughness 
scattering mechanisms are crucial in the 
determination of the overall carrier mobility. It 
can be seen that the mobility is dominated by 
the surface roughness scattering mechanism 
for EEFF higher than 1.2 MV/cm. The inset of 
Fig. 10 shows that the SR enhancement 
increases with EEFF in the high-EEFF regime 
where the carrier mobility is dominated by 
surface roughness scatterings. 
In summary, by accurate split C–V 
mobility extraction, the strain dependence of 
SR in short-channel pMOSFETs has been 
investigated under cryogenic temperatures. 
Our measured data indicate that SR can be 
significantly enhanced by the uniaxial 
compressive strain. Furthermore, the SR has 
higher strain dependence than the PH. Our 
experimental results confirm the previously 
reported results based on simulations. 
 
3. Impact of Quantum Confinement on the 
Threshold-Voltage Roll-Off of Ultra-Thin-
Body GeOI and SOI MOSFETs [4] 
This work investigates the impact of 
quantum confinement on the short-channel 
effect (SCE) and threshold-voltage sensitivity 
to channel-length variation for ultra-thin-body 
(UTB) GeOI and SOI MOSFETs using a 
 6 
of the long-channel device is close to that of 
the short-channel one. Nevertheless, due to the 
SCE, the subthreshold swing S of the short-
channel device is larger than the long-channel 
one. Therefore, the Vth
QM
 of the short-
channel device is larger than that of the long-
channel device and the Vth roll-off considering 
the QC effect is smaller. This mechanism is 
important because it may alter the comparison 
result for Vth roll-off between SOI and GeOI 
devices. Fig. 15 shows that, contrary to the 
prediction by the CL model, the Vth roll-off for 
GeOI devices with smaller Tch can be smaller 
than that of the SOI counterparts as the QC 
effect is considered. 
In summary, depending on Tch, the 
quantum-confinement effect may increase or 
decrease the SCE of UTB devices. The critical 
channel thickness (Tch,crit) determining whether 
the QC effect increases or decreases the Vth 
roll-off depends on the BOX thickness (TBOX) 
and the channel material. Fig. 16 shows that 
the Tch,crit of GeOI MOSFETs increases with 
TBOX. In addition, for a given TBOX, the Tch,crit 
of SOI MOSFETs is smaller than that of the 
GeOI MOSFETs. This may explain why the 
suppression of Vth roll-off by the QC effect 
was not observed for the UTB SOI devices 
(with Tch = 10nm) in [20].  
 
四、計畫成果自評 
In this project we have conducted a 
comprehensive study of variability and carrier 
transport for advanced silicon-based devices. 
We have investigated the impact of uniaxial 
strain on the temperature dependence of 
mismatching properties of nanoscale 
MOSFETs. This study is important not only 
for circuit designs using advanced strained-
silicon technologies, but also for the 
fundamental understanding of intrinsic 
parameter fluctuations in CMOS devices. In 
addition, we have experimentally examined 
the impact of uniaxial strain on the surface-
roughness limited mobility using cryogenic 
temperature measurements. This study has 
facilitated the understanding of carrier 
transport in strained-silicon, and provided 
insights in device designs for future mobility 
scaling. Besides, we have investigated the 
impact of quantum confinement on the short-
channel effect for UTB GeOI and SOI 
MOSFETs using derived analytical solution of 
Schrödinger equation. Our theoretical study 
indicates that, due to the discrepancy in 
effective mass, the impact of quantum 
confinement must be considered when one-to-
one comparisons between UTB GeOI and SOI 
MOSFETs regarding the short-channel effect 
and variability are made.  
These research works have been crucial to 
the education of our graduate students to 
become leading researchers in silicon-based 
nanoelectronics. Finally, it is worth 
mentioning that our recent work [31] (also 
supported by this NSC project) regarding the 
impact of self-heating on random mismatch 
has been accepted and will be presented at 
2011 IEDM, the world preeminent forum for 
reporting technological breakthroughs in the 
areas of semiconductor and electronic device 
technology, design, physics, and modeling.

total. After the first talk (Plenary) by Intel’s Dr. Robert Chau and the second talk by 
SEMATECH, the third and fourth talks were both from IMEC. Our presentation, the fifth 
one, was regarding the quantum-mechanical modeling of advanced Ge MOSFETs. Ge as 
channel material to improve the transport property of CMOS devices is one recent 
important topic in silicon-based nanoelectronics. Our work is crucial to predicting the 
electrostatic integrity as well as the random variability of advanced Ge devices. Our 
presentation went smoothly and received several constructive feedbacks from the 
audience.  
 
二、與會心得 
 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop is one decent international workshop that focuses 
more on in-depth understanding of nano-device physics. The audience has usually 
included quite a few leaders from industry and academia who will also attend the 
Symposium on VLSI Technology right after the SNW at the same location. I remember in 
Session 6 Dr. J.-P. Colinge, a pioneer in SOI, gave an invited talk regarding Junctionless 
Transistors. This new device structure has recently attracted much attention due to its 
several advantages over the conventional bulk MOSFET. After his presentation, however, 
Dr. T. Skotnicki from STMicroelectronics expressed his concerns regarding the random 
dopant fluctuation inherent to the junctionless transistor. Through their in-depth questions 
and answers I gained valuable insights and new thoughts to this new device. 
 Right after the SNW at the same location, I also attended the 2011 Symposium on VLSI 
Technolgy from June 14
th
 to June 16
th
. The VLSI Symposium has been recognized as one 
of the premiere forums showcasing the latest breakthroughs in semiconductor technologies. 
One recent trend we can observe from the conference is the growing importance of the 
device/circuit interaction and co-optimization in nanoscale CMOS. For example, one 
“Focus Session” newly added in this year’s VLSI Symposium - “Design Enablement” 
aimed to address how new device/process/material technologies will impact circuit 
designs (through design rules, device models, DFM, etc.). In addition, a two-day overlap

In this project we have conducted a comprehensive study of variability and carrier 
transport for advanced silicon-based devices. We have investigated the impact of 
uniaxial strain on the temperature dependence of mismatching properties of 
nanoscale MOSFETs [1]. This study is important not only for circuit designs using 
advanced strained-silicon technologies, but also for the fundamental 
understanding of intrinsic parameter fluctuations in CMOS devices. In addition, 
we have experimentally examined the impact of uniaxial strain on the 
surface-roughness limited mobility using cryogenic temperature measurements [2]. 
This study has facilitated the understanding of carrier transport in 
strained-silicon, and provided insights in device designs for future mobility 
scaling. Besides, we have investigated the impact of quantum confinement on the 
short-channel effect for UTB GeOI and SOI MOSFETs using derived analytical model 
[3]. Our theoretical study indicates that, due to the discrepancy in effective 
mass, the impact of quantum confinement must be considered when one-to-one 
comparisons between UTB GeOI and SOI MOSFETs regarding the short-channel effect 
and variability are made.
