英文摘要
In this project, the concept of routing functions, which were shown effective in deriving
node-disjoint paths in the hypercube, will be generalized to construct 2n node-disjoint paths from
2n nodes (not necessarily distinct) to another 2n nodes (not necessarily distinct) in a k-ary n-cube
so that their maximal length is not greater than the diameter of k-ary n-cube plus one, which is
minimum in the worst case. For general case, the maximal length is nearly optimal (the
maximal distance between the two end nodes of these 2n paths plus four). As a by-product, the
Rabin numbers and strong Rabin numbers of k-ary n-cubes will be obtained.

3Figure 1. The structure of a 3-ary 3-cube.
There are three categories of disjoint paths, i.e., one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
Suppose that W is a network with connectivity n. According to Menger's theorem [2], there exist
n disjoint paths between every two distinct nodes of W. They belong to the one-to-one category.
Many one-to-one disjoint paths constructed for a variety of networks can be found in the
literature [5, 7-10, 12, 17, 24, 28]. On the other hand, according to Theorem 2.6 in [1], there exist
n disjoint paths from one node to another k distinct nodes in W. They belong to the one-to-many
category. Some examples of one-to-many disjoint paths can be found in [6, 9, 13, 14, 18, 22, 26].
Many-to-many disjoint paths, which connect two sets of nodes in W, can be found in [9, 15, 16].
In [15], k-pairwise disjoint paths were constructed in hypercube networks with faulty clusters.
Similar results in star networks can be found in [9, 16].
One-to-many disjoint paths were first studied in [26] where the Information Dispersal
Algorithm (IDA) was proposed on the hypercube. Taking advantages of disjoint paths, the IDA
has numerous potential applications to secure and fault-tolerant storage and transmission of
information. Other one-to-many disjoint paths in the hypercube can be found in [14, 26]. There
were one-to-many disjoint paths proposed in other networks such as star network [6, 9], circulant
network [18, 22], d-ary cube [22], generalized hypercube [22], WK-recursive network [22], and
k-ary n-cube [13]. In order to reduce the transmission latency, disjoint paths are desired to have
their maximal length minimized. The maximal lengths of disjoint paths in [18, 22, 26] were
minimized in the worst case. The maximal length of disjoint paths in [6, 9] were bounded above
by the diameter plus 6 and about 10/3 times the diameter, respectively. In [13], Gao and Hsu
constructed one-to-many node-disjoint paths in a particular class of Cayley graphs. According to
their paper, the maximal length of the constructed disjoint paths in a k-ary n-cube was bounded
above by the diameter of it plus(k1)/2.
Recently, a new concept named routing function was introduced in [19-21]. It was shown
that routing functions are effective in deriving one-to-many disjoint paths in the hypercube and
the folded hypercube [19-21]. In this project, the concept of routing function will be first
generalized to construct 2n disjoint paths from one node to another 2n nodes (not necessarily
distinct) in a k-ary n-cube so that their maximal length is not greater than the diameter of a k-ary

said to be maximal if VV' for every ': {D0, D1, …, D2n1} { 10E , 11E , …, 1 1nE , 10E ,

(Dp) is not included in any shortest path from S to Dp, and(Dq) is included in a shortest path
from S to Dq, where pq, 0p2n1, and 0q2n1. The intuitive meaning of a maximal  is
that when all(Dl) (0l2n1) could not be included in a shortest path from S to Dl, the smaller
the |Dl| is, the higher the priority for(Dl) included in a shortest path from S to Dl is.
In this project, it will first be shown that when  is maximal and V=2n, 2n disjoint paths
from S to D0, D1, …, D2n1, respectively, are constructed so that the path from S to Dl is shortest
with length |Dl|. Based on this result, several cases according to the max(|D0|, |D1|, …, |D2n1|),
will be further discussed if V2n. In each case, the discussion will focus on finding an adjacent
node 'lD of Dl, which will substitute for the node Dl during the construction of path from S to Dl.
Then, we will further generalize the construction methods, which are based on a set of routing
functions, in case of multiple source nodes (not necessarily distinct). Finally, it will also be shown
that a maximalcan be determined in O(n3) time.
五、結果與討論
In [14], Gao et al had shown that a System of Distinct Representatives can be used to
construct disjoint paths in hypercubes. Suppose that X1, X2, …, Xk are k non-empty subsets of {1,
2, …, k}. A set of c distinct integers t1
1h
X , t2
2h
X , …, tc
ch
X is called a partial System of
Distinct Representatives (SDR for short) for {X1, X2, …, Xk} if h1, h2, …, hc are all distinct, where
ck and 1hik for all 1ic. Further, the partial SDR {t1, t2, …, tc} is maximum if c is maximized.
A maximum partial SDR can be determined in O(k2.5) time. When c=k, {t1, t2, …, tc} is called an
SDR. Furthermore, Gao and Hsu generalize this concept to a class of Cayley graphs in [13].
In fact, if we correspond X0, X1, …, X2n1 to D0, D1, …, D2n1, respectively, then we can
construct disjoint paths from S to D0, D1, …, D2n1, respectively, in a knQ by Theorem 4.4 [13]
with a maximum SDR of X0, X1, …, X2n1, which corresponds to the maximal routing function of
D0, D1, …, D2n1. Besides, their maximal length is not greater than the diameter plus (k1)/2,
which provides an upper bound on Rabin numbers of k-ary n-cubes.
In this project, we also find that folded hypercubes can not be applied in the results of [13].
In the following, we show that the folded hypercube is out of the class of Cayley graph to which
Theorem 2.1 [13] can apply. Since the n-dimensional hypercube and the n-dimensional folded
hypercube share the same nodes set, both of them share the same generating base. Suppose B={b1,
b2, …, bm} is a generating base of a n-dimensional hypercube so that each bi has order ei2 for all
1im. Then the cardinality of BB1 is not greater than n as a consequence of e1e2…em=2n (the
total number of nodes in the n-dimensional hypercube). On the other hand, the cardinality of the

In this project, we construct node disjoint paths from one node to another 2n1 nodes (not
necessarily distinct) in a k-ary n-cube with maximal length not greater than it's diameter plus
(k1)/2, which provides an upper bound on Rabin numbers and strong Rabin numbers of k-ary
n-cubes. We also find that the results of [13] can not apply on the folded hypercubes, which
means that there are other routing schemes deserved for developing.
Though we did not have enough time to find the construction of disjoint paths from 2n nodes
(not necessarily distinct) to another 2n nodes (not necessarily distinct) in a k-ary n-cube, we has
already obtained deeper knowledge about the application of routing functions in constructing
disjoint paths in a k-ary n-cube. We hope that, in the near future, we can succeed in constructing
man-to-many and pair-wise disjoint paths in a k-ary n-cube.
