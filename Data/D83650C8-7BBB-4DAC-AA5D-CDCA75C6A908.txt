 Reflectarray using a variable-patch-and-slot (VPS) size method is presented. A slot as a new 
variable is added to the original variable patch (VP) size configuration. The slot plays a role to 
modify the original phase diagram. In some cases, it optimizes both sensitivity and bandwidth of 
a reflectarray. Based on this observation, we designed a reflectarray on an FR4 substrate. 
Experimental results show a maximum gain of 24.5dB at 11.4GHz with an aperture size of 
19.5cm x 25cm. It has a 1.5dB bandwidth of 19.3% and has an aperture efficiency of 31.48%. 
The cross-polarization level is bellow 25dB.

Introduction:  
 Reflectarray has been extensively studied in the literature. A common step in designing such 
an array is to adjust phase among elements when it is illuminated by a primary source [1]. 
Progressive phase shift methods for a microstrip reflectarray have been extensively studied in the 
literature. The methods include identical microstrip patch elements with variable length delay line 
[2], variable size microstrip patches [3-4], and identical microstrip patch elements with angular 
rotations [5]. In this paper, a modification to the variable size reflectarray of [4] is proposed. A 
slot as a new variable is added to the conventional design.  
  Phase adjustment from 0 to 360° in a reflectarray is required. A smoother phase variation 
versus element change is also important to relax manufacture sensitivity. In [4], a smoother phase 
variation within a range larger than 360° was obtained by stacking two or more arrays. In [4], a 
multilayer printed reflectarray based on patches of variable size was built on a low dielectric 
constant material. In [6-7], performances of reflectarrays based on variable delay line method 
were checked by the authors. In this paper, stacked variable patch size reflectarray on FR4 
substrate will be investigated with an intension to make an improvement.  
 The unit cell of the structure, denoted by “VP”, is shown in Fig.1. In this configuration, the 
top and bottom layer patches are square. The relative size of the stacked patches is considered 
fixed in the design process (a2= 0.65a1), the substrate thickness is 3.2mm (h=h1+ h2=3.2mm, h1= 
h2), and the unit cell occupies an area of 15×15mm. The commonly used substrate materials 
could be Rohacell ( )05.1=rε  [4], Duroid( )2.2=rε , FR4 ( )4.4=rε  and Arlon ( )6=rε .As a 
comparison, we adjusted patch size to obtain phase diagram based on a similar approach of [7] 
for each material. The results are shown in Fig. 2 (at 11GHz). It shows that relatively lower 
sensitivity can be obtained using Rohacell and Duroid rather than using FR4 and Arlon. As

structure. It is obtained by etching rectangular slot on bottom-layer patch of the original array. The slot introduces 
additional phase delay to modify the high slope region which is commonly seen on a reflectarray built on a high 
dielectric constant material. Therefore, more design flexibilities can be obtained.  However, we should know that as 
dielectric constant gets higher, the equivalent wavelength gets shorter. Therefore, the change of phase per mini-meter 
(not in terms of wavelength) is faster. This should be a general restriction for any phase-changing scheme in design 
of a reflectary.  What we present here is to show that we may possibly lower down the changing rate at least to 
some degrees. The method is demonstrated using FR4 as the substrate. Experiments show that we can account on the 
new modified phase diagram to design a reflectarray. Without this modification, the original curve shown in Fig.7 
suggests that as bottom-layer patch size ranges from 8mm to 9mm, only 200o.phase shift yields. It is easy to see that 
the proposed VPS method can relax manufacture sensitivity in this example.  
 Reflectarrary on high dielectric constant substrates can be made more compact. The disadvantage of doing so 
is sensitivity limitations even for a VP array. The use of a variable-patch-and-slot size (VPS) element can potentially 
solve this problem.  For a reflectarray built on FR4 substrate, experiment showed that we can get 1.5 dB gain 
bandwidth of 19.3% with an aperture efficiency of 31.48%.

        超穎材料之研究是兩個會議共有之主題,在超穎材料(Meta material)方面,主要仍因循固有
之兩種形式,亦即一是以有間隙之開口環組成之二或三維之結構為主,另一則係以並聯電感及串聯
電容形成傳輸線之形式,後者在實現上亦可結合正常之傳輸線(等效電路為串聯電感及並聯電容)
組成各種應用,例如傳統上 180 度之 rat-race coupler, 設計上需用到四分之三波長之正常傳輸線, 
但如用超穎材料之概念來實現則只需負四分之ㄧ波長, 故可以做的較小.又例如在實現陣列天線
時,我們亦可利用前述以正常傳輸線提供正相位,再加上由超穎傳輸線提供負相位,此一正及一負之
組合恰可形成使每一天線單元均達同相位,因為此處正負相位之值只要相同即可,故亦可選擇較小
之數值,以便縮小化.以開口環為主之超穎技術在天線應用方面亦是與縮小化有關,基本上微帶天線
操作於(1,0) 模態時與傳輸線之模態有類似之處,故其製作上仍以一正折射率搭配一負折射率介值
之組合來完成,此時天線共振頻率並不與實際尺寸有關,而是與正負折射率介值所佔長度方向之比
例有關,故適當控制比例亦可實現縮小化.由上觀之,超穎材料之微波應用多在縮小化方面,但此優
點亦將付出厚度增加之缺失.由發表文章觀之,不少文章亦將超穎之概念用於 THz 或光波之頻段,
其應用範圍甚廣.於 PIERS 之研討會中有一些由左旋(亦即超穎)材料構成之天線結構,如 3/26 發表
之”Design of left-handed microstrip antenna”,看來十分簡單,亦無需較厚之基板,其特性尚佳,另一篇

        我在IWAT會議發表之文章為共面環及patch 組成之雙頻天線,就feed形式而言,相較於
美國公開專利 2005/01795965 結構中,其外導體之內環須植入許多短路接地之金屬貫穿導體
(via), 而我們的方法則完全不需任何短路接地之金屬貫穿導體,故在製作上較簡單,此 feed 方式
僅需藉單一饋線,由調整與一環及一微帶天線之距離(s1,s2)即可完成雙頻,另一調整參數為饋線
之長度(l1). 此三項調整參數可有系統的使雙頻均有良好匹配.於 PIERS 會議上我發表文章

and y directions. Each reflectarray is composed of 137 elements in a 19.6 cm by 19.6cm rectangular board. 
 
 
 
            
RCS study of the proposed structure 
  
 For a single element of the reflectarray shown in Fig.1 (a), we can simulate its radar cross section (RCS) 
value scattering from a right hand circularly polarized plane wave by varying the air thickness. For each 
fixed air thickness, we sweep frequency from 8 to 12GHz.  It results in a maximum RCS value of 
-20.5dBsm at 9GHz for an optimum air thickness of 2.5mm. Optimum thickness to yield maximum RCS can 
also be verified by study of scattering fields from a group of four elements shown in Fig.3. For the structure 
of Fig.1 (a), these elements are in front of the FR4 substrate viewing toward the z-axis. We arrange four 
elements sequentially rotated by 45 degrees. Since relative phase difference at a focal point duce to a relative 
rotation angle of ϕ is 2ϕ .Scattering fields from the four elements are equivalent to radiation fields of four 
elements directly fed with 90 degrees phase difference. The technique introduced here is based on a 
sequential rotation method to improve CP performance [7]; however, it is applied to scattering fields for the 
first time. It was studied that axial ratio at bore-sight is less than 4dB from 9 to 11 GHz after scattering from 
the four-element model. In a reflectarray, there are many elements. However, rotation angle between adjacent 
elements is determined with an aim to achieving phase coherence, instead of improving CP performance. In 
our experiment, a CP horn is used to illuminate the array. We found that axial ratio of the whole reflectarray 
can be made less than 3dB even if the reflectarray is collocated with a feed horn which has an axial ratio 
greater than 3dB. Therefore, the rotation variable technique for phase coherence design in a reflectarray does 
have value-added effect on improving CP performance. 
 Simulated maximum RCS values while varying the air thickness can be seen from the first and the 
second column of Table 1. Again, the optimum thickness is 2.5mm. RCS value increases around 6dB 
compared to that of a single element due to the enlarged area. In a reflectarray, elements are illuminated by a 
feed horn at a near distance instead of a far-away uniform plane wave.  However, our experiments verify 
that optimum distance obtained by this approach is useful to determine a suitable distance to enhance gain of 
a reflectarray. 
 For the structure of Fig.1 (b), the model used for simulation contains the aforementioned four elements 
placed on backside of the FR4 material by revolving its own axis by 180 degrees. In this case, RCS is 
simulated assuming incident field being a left hand circularly polarized wave. Results are shown on the first 
and the third columns of Table.1. It is shown that optimum distance is 3mm in this case. We also note that the 
maximum RCS value for a RHCP array is larger than that for a LHCP array. 
 To achieve phase coherence as is required to focus beam to the bore-sight direction, the gapped-ring 
elements are rotated. The centermost element has zero rotation as a reference. As the rings are placed away 
from the center, rotation angle increases accordingly as described in [5, 6].  The gaps in the ring are also 
used as a mark to identify the rotation. With these gaps, the reflected wave is a right-hand or a left-hand CP 
wave, as is of the same sense as the incident wave from the feed horn.

Conclusion  
 Effect of air thickness on gain of a reflectarray is studied. Aside from its conventional form shown in 
Fig.1 (a), we can also arrange a reflectarray by rotating its own axis to yield a configuration shown in Fig.1 
(b). Fig.1 (b) displays a reflectarray using air-layer as its substrate and there is equivalent to have a 
superstrate. It is studied that gain is dependent on the air thickness for both configurations. Between them, 
array having a superstrate dielectric can result in more gain. 
     We also present RCS simulation results using few elements of a reflectarray as the scattered body. For 
a CP wave, we use 4 sequential rotated elements with an adjacent rotation angle of 45 degrees. It is studied 
that there is also an optimum thickness to yield a maximum RCS value. This optimum thickness can be used 
in a reflectarray design to enhance its gain.
