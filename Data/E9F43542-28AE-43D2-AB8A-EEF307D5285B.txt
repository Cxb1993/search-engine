1 Introduction
Process yield, process expected loss and process capability indices (PCIs) are three
basic means that have been widely applied in measuring the manufacturing pro-
cess/supplier potential and performance. Of the three, PCIs are easily understood
and can be straightforwardly applied to the manufacturing industry. Especially, sup-
pliers and manufacturers nowadays require their products be high quality with very
low fraction of nonconformities (NC), often measured in parts per million (PPM). Tra-
ditional methods for measuring fraction of NC become inapplicable for those high
quality processes since any manufacturing sample of reasonable size likely contains
no defective product items.
For this reason, recently developed PCIs, including Cp, Cpk and Cpm, have received
substantial attention in the manufacturing industries, particularly, for companies mak-
ing microelectronics devices and accessories demanding strict quality requirements.
The Cp and Cpk indices are appropriate measures of progress for quality improvement
paradigms in which reduction of variability is the guiding principle and process yield
is the primary measure of success. Those two indices are defined by Kane (1986) as
Cp = USL − LSL6σ , Cpk = min
{
USL − µ
3σ
,
µ − LSL
3σ
}
,
where USL and LSL refer to the upper and lower specification limits, respectively,
which are fixed values specified by the user. µ stands for the process mean, and σ
stands for the process standard deviation of the in-control process. However, they
are not related to the cost of failing to meet customer’s requirement. Taguchi, on the
other hand, emphasizes the loss in a product’s worth when one of its characteristics
departs from the customer’s target value τ = (USL + LSL)/2. To help account for
this, Hsiang and Taguchi (1985) introduced the index Cpm defined as (1), sometimes
called the Taguchi index or loss-based capability index, which was also proposed
independently by Chan et al. (1988). The Cpm index emphasizes on measuring the
ability of the process to cluster around the target, which therefore reflects the degrees
of process targeting (centering).

where d = (USL − LSL)/2 refers to the half length of the allowable tolerance of the

two variation components: (i) variation of the process mean and (ii) deviation of the

In this paper, we applied the idea of GCIs to obtain lower confidence limits (LCLs)
that are exact probability expressions in a sense of generalization but are approxima-
tions for the conventional lower confidence limits, denoted as GLCLs (lower limits of
generalized confidence intervals) for Cpm. GLCLs not only provide critical informa-
tion regarding process performance but are used to determine if an improvement was
made in reducing non-conforming percent and process expected loss. For practical
applications, two GLCLs for Cpm based on the notations of generalized pivotal quan-
tities (GPQs) are considered, (i) to assess the minimum performance of one manu-
facturing process/one supplier performance, (ii) to assess the smallest performance of
several manufacturing processes/several suppliers for equal as well as unequal process
variances.
To clarify the presentation, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Sect. 2, a brief introduction of GCIs idea is given. Section 3 assesses the minimum
performance of one manufacturing process/one supplier based on the GLCL for Cpm.
We tabulate the minimum value for making decision to illustrate the applicability
of the proposed approach. In Sect. 4, derivations of the GLCL for Cpm, the lowest
performance of several manufacturing processes/several suppliers for equal as well
as unequal process variances are investigated along with an application example. For
evaluating the minimum performance of one manufacturing process/one supplier and
the smallest performance of several manufacturing processes/several suppliers, the
detailed derivations on 100(1 − α)% GLCLs for Cpm and min
1≤i≤kCpmi are shown in
Appendices A and B, respectively. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5.
2 Generalized confidence intervals (GCIs)
We now give a brief introduction to the concepts and definitions of GCIs. The method of
GCIs is valuable whenever standard pivotal quantities are either nonexistent or difficult
to obtain. To illustrate the problem and to formulate the GCI, consider an observable
random variable X i from population πi , i =1, 2, . . . , k, with cumulative distribution
function Fψi , where ψi = (θi ,ϑ i ) is a vector of unknown parameters, θi is the param-
eter of interest, and ϑ i is a vector of nuisance parameters. For convenience, let xi
be an observation of X i , X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xk), x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk),ϑ =
(
ϑ1,ϑ2,
. . . ,ϑk
)
, and ψ = (ψ1,ψ2, . . . ,ψk). Based on x , our goal is to derive a 100(1 − α)%
GCI for the situations when θ = θi when k = 1 and for θ = min
1≤i≤kθi with k > 1.
It is well known that CCIs in statistical problems involving nuisance parameters
are available only in some special cases. To remedy this, Weerahandi (1993, 1995)
proposed GPQs and derived GCIs as an extension of CCIs. The following definitions
are taken from Weerahandi (1995):
Definition 1 Let R = R(X; x,ψ) be a function of X and possibly x and ψ as well,
Then R is said to be a generalized pivotal quantity (GPQ) if it satisfies the following
conditions,
[1] R has a probability distribution free of unknown parameters;
[2] the observed pivotal, defined as robs = r(x; x,ψ) does not depend on the
nuisance parameter ϑ .

3.1 Simulation results
Using a simulation study, we now examine the performance of the GLCLs. We use
LSL =−3 and USL = 3 and draw 2,000 random samples of size n ∈ {25, 50, 100, 150}
from processes in four scenarios of a experiment design using (µ, σ ) = (1, 1), (1, 0.5),
(0, 1) and (0, 0.5), respectively. These provide Cpm = 0.7071, 0.8944, 1.00 and 2.00,
respectively, so as to detect the influence of the percentage coverage rate (CR) and
the mean value of lower confidence bounds (MLCB) for the GLCI methods. The esti-
mated CR is then the proportion of times the true value of Cpm exceeds the LCB.
The estimated MLCB is the average of the 2,000 values of LCBs. The mean value of
Cˆpm (ME) is simply the average of the 2,000 values of Cˆpm. Table 1 presents the ME,
CR and MLCB derived from the simulation for each pair of
(
n, Cpm
)
for a nominal
confidence level of 95% for the Cpm. The CR and MLCB entries are used as a basis for
evaluating the performance of various methods. The CRs indicate that the performance
of the GLCLs for Cpm is quite satisfactory.
3.2 The minimum value MV(1 − α) for making decision
From (5), we find that the minimum value of C/Cˆpm, denoted by MV(1 − α), is
required to ensure the confidence level reaching a certain desirable value 1 − α. The
minimum value MV(1 − α) equivalently satisfies
1 − α = P
{
CGPQpm ≥ C |x
}
= P
{
CGPQpm ≥ Cˆpm × MV (1 − α) |x
}
, (6)
which is useful in practice to evaluate the minimum performance of the process. Based
on (5), we tabulate MV (1 − α) for various n=10(5)150 (range from 10 to 150 by the
increment of 5) and |δ| = 0(0.5)2.0 in Tables 2, 3 and 4 for 1 − α = 0.90, 0.95 and
0.975, respectively. For example, for 1 − α = 0.95, n = 60 and δ = 0.5, we can find
MV (1 − α) = 0.841 from Table 3. In this case, if Cˆpm = 1.5 is calculated from the
observed data, the GLCL on Cpm, C can be obtained as Cˆpm ×MV(1 − α) = 1.2615.
We therefore conclude that the true value of the process capability Cpm, is no less
than 1.2615 with 95% level of confidence. We thus can assure that the process yield
is 99.985% (Y ield ≥ 2(3 × 1.2615) − 1), and the number of the NC is less than
155 PPM (NC% ×106 ≤ 2(−3 × 1.2615) × 106). If you use Cˆpm = 1.5 instead of
1.2615, you get yield = 99.999% instead of 99.985% and the NC is less than 7 PPM
instead of 155 PPM.
3.3 An application example-power distribution switch
Consider the following case taken from a manufacturing plant making various types
of power-distribution switches (PDS). The PDS is made for applications where heavy
capacitive loads and short circuits are likely to be encountered. These devices are
around 33 and 80 m N-channel MOSFET high-side power switches. The functional
block diagram of a single 33 m PDS is displayed in Fig. 1. The switch is controlled

by a logic enable compatible with 5-V logic and 3-V logic. Gate drive is provided
with an internal charge pump designed to control the power-switch rise times and
fall times to minimize current surges during switching. The charge pump requires no
external components and allows operation from supplies as low as 2.7 V. When the
output load exceeds the current-limit threshold or a short is present, the switch limits
the output current to a safe level by switching into a constant-current mode, pulling
the over-current logic output low. When continuous heavy overloads and short cir-
cuits increase the power dissipation in the switch, causing the junction temperature
to rise, a thermal protection circuit shuts off the switch to prevent damage. Recovery
from a thermal shutdown is automatic once the device has cooled sufficiently. Internal

improve the process if necessary (Chan et al. 1988; Pearn and Shu 2003). Historical
data based on routine process monitoring has been justified to be in statistical control
and run under the desired stable conditions. The process distribution is also justified
and shown to be fairly close to the normal distribution using Shapiro–Wilks normality
test. The collected sample of size n = 50 is taken from the stable process and the
calculated sample mean x¯ = 0.9730A, sample variance s2 = 0.002916A2, δ = −0.5
and Cˆpm = 1.6563 with n = 50, 1 − α = 0.95 and δ = −0.50. By ckecking
Table 3, the MV(1 − α) = 0.825, therefore, the GLCL for Cpm can be obtained as

5 Conclusion
Process yield, process expected loss and process capability indices (PCIs) are three
basic means that have been widely applied in measuring the manufacturing pro-
cess/supplier potential and performance. To properly and accurately estimate the capa-
bility index, numerous conventional approaches have been proposed to obtain lower
limits of the classical confidence intervals (CLCLs) for providing process capabil-
ity information. The conventional approach lacks for exact confidence intervals for
Cpm involving unknown parameters which is a notable shortcoming. In this paper, we
applied the idea of generalized confidence intervals (GCIs) to obtain lower confidence
limits (LCLs) that are exact probability expressions in a sense of generalization but
are approximations for the conventional lower confidence limits, denoted as GLCLs,
for Cpm. Two GLCLs for Cpm based on the notations of generalized pivotal quantities
(GPQs) are developed, (i) to assess the minimum performance of one manufacturing
process/one supplier performance, and (ii) to assess the smallest performance of sev-
eral manufacturing processes/several suppliers for equal as well as unequal process
variances. Rather than Monte Carlo simulations which are popular used in GCIs meth-
odology, we presented detailed theoretical derivations that both GLCLs for Cpm can
be written in closed forms. We also developed the programs of the numerical integra-
tion for evaluating the 100(1 − α)% GLCLs for Cpm when both practical situations
happen in real application.

Process capability indices (PCIs) have become popular as unit-less measures on
whether a process is capable of reproducing items meeting the quality requirement.7
A reliable approach for testing process capability is to establish an interval estimate,
for which we can assert that it contains the true PCI value with a reasonable degree9
of certainty. However, the construction of such an interval estimate is not trivial,
since the distribution of the commonly used Cpk index involves unknown param-11
eters. In this paper, we adopt the concept of generalized confidence intervals and
generalized pivotal quantities to derive the generalized lower confidence bounds for13
providing critical information on process performance. Two practical applications
in the area of process capability were considered, they include (i) assessing whether15
a process under investigation is capable and (ii) providing the lowest performance
of the manufacturing processes from several production lines or several suppliers17
for quality assurance. The applicability of the derived results is also illustrated with
examples. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.19

1. INTRODUCTION
Many organizations, as part of their improvement programs, utilize process capability indices (PCIs)23 to evaluate the ability of a process satisfying the specified requirements. Several PCIs are availablein the literature (see Kotz and Lovelace1 and Kotz and Johnson2), which are designed to provide25
a common and easily understood language for quantifying process performance, and are dimensionless
functions of process parameters and manufacturing specifications. Let USL and LSL denote the upper and27
lower specification limits, d = (USL−LSL)/2 and M = (USL+LSL)/2 are the half-length and the midpoint

In this paper, we first apply the idea of GCIs to obtain the lower confidence bound (LCB) of the commonly1
used index Cpk for assessing the process performance. The LCB not only gives a clue on the minimum level
of the actual performance of the process, which is tightly related to the fraction of non-conforming, but is also3
useful in making decisions for capability testing. As rapid advancement of the manufacturing technology,
current companies in the automotive and electronics sectors have implemented the mass production method5
to produce large amounts of standardized products on several production lines. Besides, most of large
manufacturers increase their level of supplies from several suppliers (out-sourcing) and are relying more7
heavily on their supply chain as a source of their competitive advantage. In these practical situations,
manufacturers are not only interested in measuring the capability of the process under investigation, but also9
in considering the lowest performance of manufacturing processes from several production lines/suppliers
for quality assurance. Let 1,2, . . .,k be h populations where observations Xi j from i are independently11
distributed as N(i ,2i ), where i =1,2, . . .,h, j =1,2, . . .,n. The Cpk index is a function of the unknown
mean and variance. We consider that i is better than  j if Cpki >Cpk j . Therefore, our goal is to construct13
an interval estimation of min1≤i≤h Cpki .
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first introduced some basic definitions and notations15
of GCIs and GPQs. The formula of a 100(1−)% generalized lower confidence bound (GLCB) for Cpk is
derived. In Section 3, a testing procedure and the values of GLCB with various parameters are provided for17
practitioners to assess the process performance in their factory. Further, we consider the lowest performance
of manufacturing processes from several production lines/suppliers in Section 4. That is, a 100(1−)%19
GLCB for min1≤i≤h Cpki is developed for quality assurance. This concept is illustrated with application
examples in Section 5. In the final section some conclusions are given.21
2. GENERALIZED LOWER CONFIDENCE BOUND FOR Cpk OF THE PROCESS
In this section, some basic concepts of GCIs and CPQs are introduced and reviewed from Iyer and Patterson2323
and Burdick et al.29. The definitions and notations below will be used throughout the paper unless otherwise
stated. Construction of a GCI requires a GPQ with a distribution that is free of the model parameters.25
Suppose we wish to construct a GCI for . Let X represent a random variable with the distribution function
F(x,,), where  is the parameter of interest,  is a nuisance parameter and x is the observed value of X .27
Definition 1. Let R= R(X, x,,) is a function of X , the observed value x , parameters  and . Then R is
said to be a GPQ if it satisfies the following two conditions:29
(i) For fixed x , the distribution of R is free from any unknown parameters.
(ii) The observed value of R, Robs = R(x, x,,), does not depend on nuisance parameters.31
Definition 2. Let  be the parameter space of . If a subset C1− of the sample space of R satis-
fies P{R(X, x,,)∈C1−}=1−, then the subset C of the parameter space given by C (1−)=33
{∈|Robs ∈C1−} is said to be a 100(1−)% GCI for .
Under the assumption of normality, suppose X¯ and S2 are independent random variables with X¯ ∼35
N(,2/n) and (n−1)S2/2 ∼2n−1, where  and 2 are unknown constants. The pair (X¯, S2) may be
viewed as the sample mean and sample variance (complete and sufficient statistics) from an i.i.d. N(,2)37
sample of size n. Write 1 = and 2 =. Consider the functions f1 and f2 defined by
Z = f1(X¯ , S2,,)= X¯ −

From these tables, it is clear that the CPs of GLCB are consistently close to the nominal value in most1
cases. Only few cases for processes are centered (i.e. = M), the CPs of GLCB are slightly conservative.
In terms of the expected values of GLCB, the values of E(LGpk) tend to increase toward the true value of3
Cpk as n increases, this is as expected from the theory. Therefore, the simulation results indicate that the
performance of the proposed GLCB for Cpk is quite satisfactory.5
3.2. Procedures for assessing process performance based on the GLCB
There are several approaches to determine whether a given process capability meets the customers’ demands7
and runs under the desired quality condition. Critical values are usually used for make decisions in capability
testing with designated type I error , the risk of misjudging an incapable process as a capable one. The9
p-values present the actual risk of misjudging an incapable process as a capable one. That is, if p-value <
then we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the process is capable with actual type I error p-value11
(rather than ). However, both approaches, critical values and p-values, do not convey any information

and n, and Cˆpk ,  calculated from the collected samples, we can obtain the GLCB for Cpk by solving1
Equation (5). If the obtained GLCB for Cpk is greater than the preset capability level c0, then we can
conclude that the process meets the capability requirement (Cpk>c0). Otherwise, we do not have sufficient3
information to conclude that the process meets the capability requirement. In this case, we would believe
that Cpk ≤c0. Therefore, the practitioners can easily use the proposed procedure on their in-plant application5
to make reliable decisions. We remark that the process must be stable in order to produce a reliable estimate
of process capability. If the process is out of control, the top priority is to find and eliminate the assignable7
causes of variability to bring the process in-control.

5. APPLICATION EXAMPLES
Example 1. To illustrate how the proposed procedure is applied to actual data collected from a factory, we9
consider the following example taken from a company that manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs).
PCBs are widely used in the microelectronic manufacturing industry, making computers and peripherals,11
digital phones, fax machines, channel switch devices, remote controls and many others. A typical type of
PCB is investigated. The thickness of the PCB is the critical characteristic the company focuses on, which13
has significant impact to product quality. The lower and upper specification limits are LSL=13.5m and
USL=28.5m, respectively. The capability requirement for this particular model of PCB was defined as15
satisfactory if Cpk>1.20.
Historical data based on routine process monitoring show that the process is under statistical control, the17
process distribution is justified and shown to be fairly close to the normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilks
normality test. The collected samples of size 80 are taken from the stable process and the sample mean and19
sample standard deviation are calculated as x¯ =21.285m, s =1.633m. And we then calculate the value
of the estimator Cˆpk =1.4724, and =0.175. By solving Equation (5), the 95% GLCB for Cpk is found to21
be C =1.2678 based on the collected samples. In this case, it is therefore concluded with 95% confidence
that the thickness of the PCB manufacturing process satisfies the requirement ‘Cpk>1.20’. Furthermore, the23
value of GLCB for Cpk ,C =1.2678, means we are 95% confident that at least 99.9857% of the produced
PCBs are conformed to the manufacturing specifications (or no more than 143 non-conforming units in25
parts per million).
Example 2. In particular, suppose that there are four production lines of manufacturing PCB processes27
considered. The manufacturer would be desirable to determining a bound which is the smallest value of
the process capability from these four production lines no less than the bound value with certain level of29
confidence. Table II presents the summary of statistics based on production line data each of size 50. Q1

illustrate the practicality of our approach. To make the obtained results practical for in-plant applications,
we also tabulate the value of GLCB for various sample sizes and desirable confidence levels. Therefore, the3

Abstract 
The purchasing function directly affects the competitive ability of a firm. Since the 
determination of suitable suppliers from a set of suppliers has become a key strategic 
consideration, managers need to periodically evaluate suppliers on the basis of their products 
quality to select suppliers whose quality characteristics of products meet the standards. The 
fuzzy data commonly existing in our reality world, in this fuzzy environment, the 
quality-based supplier selection is proposed in this paper. The quantification of the process 
capability is effective to understand the quality of the units shipped from a supplier. For the 
purpose of constructing the membership function of fuzzy capability-index estimate for each 
supplier, we apply resolution identity theorem, a renowned result in fuzzy sets theory, in terms 
of solving optimization problems. The preferable suppliers are selected by using a ranking 
method of fuzzy preference relation of suppliers. Finally, a case study of touch screen is 
provided to describe the applicability incorporating the fuzzy data into the problem of 
quality-based supplier selection and evaluation.  
Keywords: Fuzzy number; Resolution identity; Fuzzy preference relation; Optimization. 
1. Introduction  
It is well recognized that suppliers play a crucial role in the production chain and hence 
in the long term viability of a company. Close working relationships with high performing 
suppliers are essential in modern production environments. Just-in-time, total quality 
management, and flexible manufacturing systems have become part of the standard 
vocabulary in management theory. Supplier selection decisions are an important component 
of production and logistics management for many firms. Such decisions entail the selection of 
individual suppliers to employ, and the determination of order quantities to be placed with the 
selected suppliers. Selecting right suppliers significantly reduces the material purchasing cost 
and improves corporate competitiveness, which is why many experts believe that the supplier 
selection is the most important activity of a purchasing department (2005). 
Supplier selection is one of the most critical activities of purchasing management in a 
supply chain, because of the key role of supplier’s performance on cost, quality, delivery and 
service in achieving the objectives of a supply chain. With increasingly competitive global 
world markets, companies are under intense pressure to find ways to cut production and 
 3
essential to understand the quality of the units produced from a manufacturing process. 
Taguchi emphasized the loss occurred in a product’s worth when its key quality characteristic 
deviates from the customers' target ( ) 2USL LSLτ = + , where USL  and LSL  stand for the 
upper and lower specification limits, respectively, and the values of USL  and LSL  are 
determined by decision-makers. In order to take into account these basic parameters that have 
been widely used to measure the manufacturing processes performance or supplier potentials, 
Hsiang and Taguchi (1985) introduced pmC  index defined as 
2 26 ( )
pm
USL LSLC σ μ τ
−= + − ,       (1) 
sometimes called the Taguchi index or loss-based capability. Table 1 lists the various values 
of pmC  and its corresponding maximum possible nonconformities in parts per million (PPM). 
The value of pmC  is varied from the lower value of 1.00 to the upper value of 2.00 with 
increments of 0.05 at each step. For example, if a process has capability with 1.2pmC ≥ , then 
the production yield would be at least 99.968%. In other words, the number of the 
nonconformities is less than 318.2 PPM. 
Cpm PPM Cpm PPM Cpm PPM Cpm PPM

 It is natural to investigate the problem of supplier selection and evaluation for the cases 
with q ( 2q ≥ ) candidate suppliers based on the pmC  index. Let iP  be the population of 
supplier i with the mean iμ  and variance 2iσ  for i = 1, 2,…, q. The capability index pmiC  of 
supplier i can be defined as follows: 
2 26 ( )
pmi
i i i
USL LSLC σ μ τ
−= + −        (2) 
for i = 1,2,…,q. 
Conceptually, in evaluating a group of suppliers, the assessment requires knowledge of 
iμ  and iσ  of each supplier in Eq. (2). However, iμ  and iσ  usually unknown for i = 1,2,…, 
q. In this case, the sample data must be collected from each supplier which is in order to 
estimate the value of index pmiC  and to assess/select the appropriate suppliers. Let 
1ix , 2ix ,…, inix  be the independent random samples from Pi for i = 1,2,…, q. Generally, 
continuous data obtained from the output responses of supplier’s key quality characteristics

fuzzy set. It is defined by a membership function, all the information about a fuzzy set is 
described by its membership function. The membership function maps elements (crisp inputs) 
in the universe of discourse (interval that contains all the possible input values) to elements 
(degrees of membership) within a certain interval, which is usually [0, 1]. Then, the degree of 
membership specifies the extent to which a given element belongs to a set or is related to a 
concept. The most commonly used range for expressing degree of membership is the unit 
interval [0, 1].  
Definition 2.1: A fuzzy subset a  in a universe of discourse ℜ  is characterized by a 
membership function ( )a xε   which associates with each element x in ℜ  a real number in the 
interval [0,1]. The fuzzy subset a  of ℜ  is defined by a function aε  : [ ]0,1ℜ→ , which is 
called membership function. We can also write the fuzzy set a  as ( )( ) }{ , : .ax x xε ∈ℜ We 
denote ( ){ }: aa x xα ε α= ≥ as the α-level set of a , where a  is the closure of the set ( ){ }: 0 .ax xε ≠   
Proposition 2.1 (Zadeh (1965). a  is a convex fuzzy set if and only if ( ){ }: ax xε α≥ is a 
convex set for allα. 
Remark 2.1 Let a  be a fuzzy number. We regard, 0a , the 0-level set of a  as the closure of 
the set ( ){ }: 0 .ax xε ≠ If a  is a bounded fuzzy number then 0a  is a compact set. 
According to above definitions we realize that a convex and normalized fuzzy set 
defined on real numbers whose membership function is piecewise continuous is called a fuzzy 
number, it must possess the following four properties: 
n a  is normal, i.e., there exists an x∈ℜ  such that ( ) 1a xε = . 
o aε   is a quasi-concave, i.e., ( )( )1a tx t yε + − ≥  min ( ) ( ){ },a ax yε ε   for [ ]0,1t∈ . 
p aε   is upper semiconscious , i.e., ( ){ }: ax xε α∈ℜ ≥  is a closed subset of ℜ  for each ( ]0,1α ∈ .  
q The 0-level set 0a  is a closed and bounded subset of ℜ . 
Fig. 1 shows a fuzzy number of the universe of discourse ℜwhich is both convex and 
normal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proposition 2.2: If a  a closed fuzzy number then the α-level set of a  is a closed interval 
which is denoted by ,L Ua a aα α α⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦   . (That is why we call a  as closed fuzzy number). 
Proof: aε   is an upper semiconscious function, so the α-level set ( ){ }: aa x xα ε α= ≥ is a

The triangular fuzzy number a  can be expressed as “around 2a “ or “ being approximately 
equal to 2a “ , where 2a  is called the core value of a , and 1a  and 3a  are called the left and 
right spread values of a , respectively. The α- level set (a closed interval) of a  is then 
( ) ( )1 2 3 21 , 1a a a a aα α α α α= − + − +⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦ . 
That is, ( ) 1 21La a aα α α= − +  and ( ) 3 21Ua a aα α α= − + .We also see that the triangular 
fuzzy number is a fuzzy real number. 
3. Estimation of Cpmi Using Fuzzy Quality Data 
The significance of the methodology proposed is that it is capable of dealing with fuzzy 
data, which are known to represent the uncertainties in the real world. Now, we will present 
the fuzzy estimation of  Cpmi for each supplier i using fuzzy data.  
Let us consider 1ix  ,…, inix  as fuzzy observations (fuzzy data) and assume all of them 
are fuzzy real numbers. Therefore, for any given ( ]0,1α ∈ , we can get the corresponding 
real-data ( )Lijx α  and ( )Uijx α for i = 1, … ,q and j = 1, … ,ni. Using the real-valued data ( )1 Lix α ,…, ( )Linix α  and substituting in Eq. (2) , we can obtain the estimate

 From this section, we present the computational method to obtain the membership 
degree of any given value r of the fuzzy estimate ˆpmic  for  i =1,…,q. By applying the result 
of “resolution identity” shown in section 2 , the membership function of ˆpmic  can be written 
by 
( ) ( ) ( )ˆ1sup 1 pmia cor rααε α≤ ≤= ⋅   
Therefore, given any value r of ˆpmic  , its membership degree can be obtained by solving 
the following optimization problem.

where ( )ˆ Lpmic α and ( )ˆ Upmic α are from Eq. (9) and (10) respectively. For the notational

An optimization subroutine called “fmincon” which is built-in in the commercial software 
MATLAB, can be used to construct the h-level set ( )ˆpm hc of the fuzzy estimate ˆpmc  by 
solving the nonlinear programming problems with bounded variables that are given in Eq. (11) 
and (12). 
4. Supplier Selection  
4.1 Fuzzy preference relation (FPR) 
In this section, we follow the ranking method forthe set of all fuzzy numbers proposed by 
Yuan (1991) who claimed that her/his ranking method is very reasonable based on four 
criteria that are fuzzy preference presentation, rationality of fuzzy ordering, distinguish ability 
and robustness. The results obtained by Yuan are based on the normal and convex fuzzy sets; 
that is, the fuzzy sets satisfy condition n and o on Definition 2.1 introduced in section 2. 
Now, we use our notations to rewrite the main results were obtained by Yuan (1991). Let ˆpmic  
and ˆpmjc  be the fuzzy estimates of pmC  indices of suppliers i and j, respectively. Then we can 
define a fuzzy preference relation (FPR) between ˆpmic  and ˆpmjc  as 
  FPR ( )ˆ ˆ, ijpmi pmj
ij ji
c c

degreeγ . If FPR ( )ˆ ˆ, 1pmi pmjc c γ< −  . Secondly, it obviously can realize the rule (vi) is the 
counterpart of the rule (i) according to Eq. (12). In other words, the rule (vi) can be rewritten 
as: ˆpmic  is more preferred to ˆpmjc with the preference degree γ . If FPR ( )ˆ ˆ, 1pmj pmic c γ< −  .Finally, 
from Eq. (12) again, we are convinced that the rule (ii) is equal to the rule (v). In other words, 
if ˆpmjc  is indifferent from ˆpmic  with the indifference degree ( ),1γ γ− , then ˆpmic  is indifferent 
from ˆpmjc with the indifference degree ( ),1γ γ− ,and vice versa. Based on the above 
observations, it suffices to consider the fuzzy preference relation FPR ( )ˆ ˆ,pmi pmjc c   to select the 
most preferred supplier. 
Calculating the value of FPR ( )ˆ ˆ,pmi pmjc c   by resort to the numerical integration to obtain 
the value of ijΔ  and jiΔ , we can sort {S1,…,Sq} into {Sh1,…,Shq} such that, for i < j, ˆpmhic  is 
more preferred to ˆpmhjc  or ˆpmhic , is indifferent from ˆpmhjc  on the basis of the above rules 
(i)-(iii). 
According to above descriptions, there are some interesting observations made. We know 
two suppliers Si and Sj  are indifferent from each other if and if only ( )ˆ ˆ1 ,pmi pmjc cλ γ− ≤ ≤  . 
Therefore, we can tell that if γ  is close to 0.5, then we have less chance to conclude that 
these two suppliers Si and Sj  are indifferent from each other. On the contrary, if γ  is large, 
then we have more chance to conclude that the suppliers Si and Sj  are indifferent from each 
other. For the extreme case by taking the preference degree 0.5γ = , we see that the two 
suppliers Si and Sj  are indifferent from each other if and only if FPR ( )ˆ ˆ, 0.5pmi pmjc c =  .by 
considering it, we have a great chance to obtain a total order sequence {Shi,...,Shq}; that is, we 
have a great chance to conclude that Shi is more preferred to Shj  for any i < j. However, this 
sequence has a slight drawback when the value of FPR ( )1ˆ ˆ,pmhi pmhic c +   is close to 0.5. 
For example, if FPR ( )1ˆ ˆ, 0.5012pmhi pmhic c + =  , under 0.5γ = . Theoretically, we need to 
conclude that Shi is more preferred to Shi+1. However, from the point of human’s view/ 
intuition that makes us think the suppliers Shi and Shi+1 should be regarded as indifference. 
Form Fig. 5, we can definitely see the curve Shi and curve Shi+1 are almost overlapped. The 
good thing is that we can overcome this drawback by taking a larger value of γ  and solve 
this problem.

5.1 Touch Screen Introduction  
Touch screens are display overlays which have the ability to display and receive 
information on the same screen. The effect of such overlays allows a display to be used as an 
input device, removing the keyboard and/or the mouse as the primary input device for 
interacting with the display's content. The systems designed to help individuals who have 
difficulty manipulating a mouse or keyboard. Such displays can be attached to computers or, 
as terminals, to networks. Touch screens also have assisted in recent changes in the design of 
personal digital assistant (PDA), satellite navigation, and mobile phone devices, making these 
devices more usable. It is an easy to use input device that allows users to control PC software 
and DVD video by touching the display screen. 
The touch screen uses a glass panel with a uniform conductive ITO (indium tin oxide) 
coating on the one-side surface. A PET film is tightly suspended over the ITO coating 
surfaces of a glass panel. The glass substrate and the PET film are separated by tiny, 
transparent insulating dot spacers. The PET film has a hard coating on the outer side and a 
conductive ITO coating on the inner side. We can clearly see the structure schema of touch 
screen from Fig. 6. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6 : The structure schema of touch screen 
With the growing number of outdoor touch applications and with the advent of HR 
(highly reflective) LCDs, the production of touch screens using anti-reflective coatings are 
increasing. The amount of light which passes through a solid is impacted both by its color 
absorption and the bending of light at the air/surface interface. For example, a glass window 
passes about 95% of the light; while the color absorption is minimal, the bending of the light 
going in and coming out of the glass “uses” up about 5% of the light. One can see the impact 
of this phenomenon as a reflection from the first surface. Oddly, by adding purple tinged 
anti-reflective materials to glass, the light transmission rate can exceed the ordinary 95%. 
Almost all touch screens put a silica coating on the first surface to diffuse the reflective 
light and reduce the mirror effect. This is called an anti-glare coating, not to be confused with 
an anti-reflective coating. Anti-glare coatings are relatively inexpensive and enhance the 
scratch resistance of the touch panel. However, anti-glare coatings diffuse the image and 
consequently reduce the sharpness of the display image, reducing visual clarity. The amount 
of diffusion is measured as the haze factor.

γ  is set to be 0.50. In the light of Step 2 in the above procedure, the sequence of suppliers 
arranged by considering the preference of selection is given by { S5,S1,S4,S2,S3 }. On the basis 
of the result of the sorting we are convinced that Supplier 5 is the most preferred choice and 
Supplier 3 is the worst choice among all five suppliers with the preference degree 0.50. 
(2)  Furthermore, if the value of γ  is set to be 0.65, then the sequence goes for { ( S2,S3 ), 
( S2,S4 ), ( S3,S4 )}, in which S2 is indifferent from S3, S2  is indifferent from S4, and S3 is 
indifferent from S4 with indifference degrees (0.65,0.35), that can be written as below.   
 
      0.35≤FPR ( )2 3ˆ ˆ,pm pmc c  ≤0.65 and 0.35≤FPR ( )3 2ˆ ˆ,pm pmc c  ≤0.65

In other words, supplier S5 and supplier S1 is still the most preferred supplier with the 
preference degree 0.65. In this case, the manger may randomly select one of supplier S5 and 
supplier S1 as the most preferred supplier, or provide some other criteria to select the most 
preferred supplier form supplier S5 and supplier S1. Surely, if the company is allowed to select 
more than one supplier to supply this particular touch screen for manufacturing, then both 
suppliers S5 and supplier S1  are the most preferred supplier.         
6. Conclusions  
Fuzzy logic is a powerful problem-solving methodology with a myriad of applications in 
embedded control and information processing. Fuzzy provides a remarkably simple way to 
draw definite conclusions from vague, ambiguous or imprecise information. In a sense, fuzzy 
logic resembles human decision making with its ability to work from approximate data and 
find precise solutions. This paper proposed an approach for the selection of suppliers, which 
model is capable of handling fuzzy data and was not seriously treated by the researchers. 
The quality-based supplier selection and evaluation using the imprecise sample data has 
been applied for supplier selection. A general method is proposed to obtain the fuzzy estimate 
of the capability index pmiC  of supplier i using “resolution identity” in fuzzy sets theory. 
In order to derive the membership degree of any given γ  of fuzzy estimate ˆpmic  , the 
original problem is transformed into the optimization problems. After obtaining the fuzzy

Integrated Procedure for Nanotechnology In-Process Monitoring and
Measuring Process Performance with Multiple Components of Common
Cause Variability
國立高雄應用科技大學 蘇明鴻
在今日國際間激烈競爭環境下，高科技電子與奈米產業，唯有在高精密度規格
下達到極高品質的保證水準(6 ;不良率低於3.4 PPM)，才能使產品在市場上具
有競爭優勢，然而為達到所須之品質保證，必須在整個生產檢驗過程中，擁有
完備的生產製程控制與製程能力測量方法與技術。目前一般傳統所使用的品質
監控與管理技術方法，包含統計製程控制(statistical process control)、實
驗設計(design of experiment)、允收抽樣(acceptance sampling plan)，在
面對極高品質計量性的控制與衡量時，皆有其缺陷。除此之外目前廣泛使用於
生產製程監控與製程績效評估之抽樣模式，均只考慮批量內變異(within-batch
variability)，然而許多高科技製程在移除非機遇原因後(assignable
cause)，具有多重機遇原因(common cause)變異，亦即製程中常見之批量間變
異甚至多重機遇原因變異現象(inherent batch-to-batch variability, even
three or more level nested variability) 藉由本研究所提出之生產製程監
控與製程績效衡量方法，提供適當之品質工程與管理決策技術以生產高良率、
高品質水準的高科技產品。
With speedy advance in high-technology manufacture, manufacturers and
suppliers require their products be high quality with very low
fraction of nonconformities. Traditional methods, such as statistical
process control (SPC), design of experiment (DOE), and acceptance
sampling plan (ASP) for monitoring, measuring, and controlling those
high-quality processes with a low nonconforming fraction (less than
3.4 PPM; 6  basic philosophy) become unsatisfactory. Many high-tech
production processes exhibit a certain amount of between-batch
variations besides the usual within-batch variability and there is
abundant scope for considering variance component models for the
purpose of monitoring and assessing the actual process performance.
The implementation of existing statistical process control and
process capability measures for high-tech processes can be assured
them tightly controlled under a six-sigma manufacturing discipline.
