anomalous turn-around characteristic with stress time and stress gate 
voltage. Persistent post-stress drain current degradation is found in a 
pMOSFET, as opposed to drain current recovery in its n-type MOSFET 
counterpart. A bipolar charge trapping model along with trap generation 
in a HfSiON gate dielectric is proposed to account for the observed 
phenomena. Post-stress single charge emissions from trap states in 
HfSiON are characterized. Charge pumping and carrier separation 
measurements are performed to support our model.  
 
 Self-heating induced transient hot carrier effects are investigated in 
Chapter 3 by using the metal-contact structure. The AC stress-frequency 
dependence of device degradation is characterized and evaluated by a 
two-dimensional numerical simulation. Our result shows that drain 
current degradation in AC stress is more serious than in DC stress 
because of the reduction of self-heating effect.

semiconductors, including the pseudo-potential method [4], the k．p method [5], the 
tight binding method [6], and the bond orbital model method [7]. In this work, the 
Luttinger-Kohn model [8] under the framework of k．p method is employed to 
calculate the valence band structure. This method has the following merits. First, the 
Luttinger-Kohn model is suitable for diamond and zinc blende structure 
semiconductors, whose band gap is much larger than the split-off energy [9]. Second, 
due to the warping of valence bands, the Luttiner-Kohn model rather than the 
effective-mass approximation is commonly used to obtain an accurate valence band 
structure. Third, the strain effects can be easily taken into account when the Bir-Pikus 
Hamiltonian [10] is incorporated into the Luttinger Hamiltonian. For the k．p method 
in the Luttinger-Kohn model (see Fig. 1.1), the heavy-hole, the light-hole and split-off 
bands in double degeneracy are considered and are called class A. The rest of the 
bands are defined as class B. The effects of bands in class B on those in class A are 
also considered.  
 Based on the theory of Luttinger-Kohn and Bir-Pikus, the valence band structure 
of a strained bulk material can be expressed in Equation (1.1) [11], 
 
H= Hk+Hε              (1.1) 
 
where Hk is the unstrained Hamiltonian (Luttinger Hamiltonian) and Hε is the strained 
Hamiltonian (Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian). Thus, the total Hamiltonian H can be expressed 
as the 6×6 Hamiltonian in the envelope function space (Equation (1.2)).

γ1, γ2, and γ3 are the Luttinger parameters. m0 is the mass of free electron. kx, ky, and kz 
are the wave vector in x, y and z direction, respectively. av, b and d are the Bir-Pikus 
deformation potentials for the valence bands. According to [12], the strain tensor (ε) 
is related to the stress tensor (σ) by the elastic compliance constant (Sij) or elastic 
stiffness constant (Cij) matrix.  
 
Sε σ= i                (1.5) 
Cσ ε= i                (1.6) 
 
The elastic compliance constant or elastic stiffness constant matrix relates the six 
strain components to the six stress components. As a result, the matrix, S or C, has 36 
coefficients. However, due to the cubic symmetry in Si or Ge, only the three 
independent coefficients are needed. Thus, the strain-stress relation can be expressed 
as Equations (1.7) and (1.8) [13].

the unit vector along the [110] direction is [ 1 1
2 2
, ,0 ]. Thus, we have σxx= 12 σ , 
σyy= 12 σ , σzz=0, σyz=0, σxz=0, and σxy= 12 σ , where σ is positive for a tensile stress 
and is negative for a compressive stress. As a consequence, according to Equation 
(1.10), 1 11 122 ( )xx S Sε σ= + ⋅ , 1 11 122 ( )yy S Sε σ= + ⋅ , 12zz Sε σ= ⋅ , 0yzε = , 0xzε = ,

444xy Sε σ= ⋅ . Then, these strain components are introduced into Equation (1.2) to 
consider the stress effect. 
When dealing with the substrate orientation other than the (100) direction, an 
appropriate rotation matrix is employed [16]. We must transform the crystallographic 
coordinate system (x,y,z) into the new coordinate system (x’,y’,z’), where z’ is also the 
new growth direction. For example, when the (110) substrate is considered, the new 
coordinate system (x’,y’,z’) is thus given by Equation (1.11). The corresponding 
Luttinger Hamiltonian components are written as Equation (1.12).

where the index i represents each mesh point and hi stands for the mesh size between 
adjacent mesh points xi and xi+1. Equation (1.16) produces an asymmetric tri-diagonal 
matrix if mesh spacing is non-uniform, which will result in a complex eigenvalue. In 
order to obtain a real-valued eigenvalue, a diagonal matrix, L, is used, as reported in 
literature [18].

When we set 2B L H= i , then B is a Hermitian matrix because of Bi,i+1=Bi+1,i. By

real-valued eigenvalues.

1.3.3 Self-consistent Solution to Poisson and Schrödinger Equations 
 The simulation flow of the coupled self-consistent Poisson and Schrödinger 
equations is described in Fig. 1.2. The classical potential is first obtained by solving 
the Poisson equation where the carrier concentrations are computed by a Fermi 
integral. Then, the potential energy takes into account the potential due to the free 
charges and ionized impurities, due to the image force from different dielectric 
12 
 
the wave-functions because of relatively small errors [23]. Thus,

where effE is the transverse effective electric field,

DOSm is the density-of-state 
effective mass, S(Q) is the power spectrum of the roughness at the interface, Q is the 
magnitude of wave-vector change. Λ is the correlation length and Δ is the average 
step height. Table 1.1 shows the scattering parameters of Si and Ge, which are 
calibrated from a conventional Si MOSFET and from a SiGe-on-insulator device, 
14 
 
and LH1, respectively, due to the high degree of degeneracy of heavy and light holes 
in Si [2]. On the other hand, the lowest two subbands in a (100) Ge-channel are HH1 
and HH2. The calculated 2D hole density of state (DOS) in a Ge-channel is shown in 
Fig. 1.5. It is obvious that the 2D DOS is not stair-like owing to the valence 
band-mixing effect. 
 
1.5.2 Hole Mobility in Si- and Ge-channels 
Fig. 1.6 compares the hole mobility as a function of a body thickness in 
(100)/[110] Si- and Ge-channel DG-pMOSFETs. The choice of the [110] channel in 
Si is because it has a larger stress effect [26]. The experimental result for Si-channels 
is also shown for comparison [1]. The pinv is set to be 4×1012cm-2. The simulated hole 
mobility in a Si-channel decreases monotonically with a body thickness, which is 
consistent with the experimental data. Unlike a Si-channel, the hole mobility in a 
Ge-channel shows a turn-around characteristic with a body thickness. When a body 
thickness reduces, the hole mobility increases gradually to a maximum around 
TGe=16nm, and then decreases drastically. Note that in the window of inversion hole 
density and body thickness considered in this work, where the transverse effective 
electric field is about 0.12 MV/cm in a Ge-channel, the surface roughness scattering 
has a minor effect on the hole mobility in a Ge-channel. The same conclusion can be 
found in [27]. Therefore, surface roughness scattering should not affect the existence 
of a mobility peak in a Ge-channel. Moreover, the calculated hole mobility at 
TGe=28nm is about 617 cm2/Vs, which deviates from the bulk value of Ge. This is due 
to larger phonon deformation potentials in a MOSFET than in a bulk material, 
resulting from stress at gate dielectric and semiconductor interface [28].  
The turn-around behavior of the hole mobility in a Ge-channel can be explained 
in the two following aspects: overlap integral and energy separation between 
16 
 
Second, the (110) substrate shows an anisotropy of energy dispersion, such that the 
(110)/[-110] channel direction exhibits a highest mobility, and then the (110)/[00-1] 
(result not shown in Fig. 1.9). The higher mobility in (110)/[-110] than in (100)/[110] 
is attributed to a lower conductivity effective mass. Third, the peak mobility in 
(110)/[-110] occurs at a smaller body thickness. This reason is that a smaller energy 
difference between the lowest two subbands is obtained in Ge (110) substrate (see the 
inset in Fig. 1.9). 
 
1.5.4 Uniaxial Compressive Stress Effect 
Finally, the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on Ge hole mobility is shown in 
Fig. 1.10. Note that the channel direction is also the uniaxial stress direction. The 
normalized hole mobility in both (100)/[110] and (110)/[-110] channel directions is 
evaluated in 0.3GPa uniaxial compressive stress. Generally, the uniaxial compressive 
stress removes the heavy hole and light hole degeneracy and alters the warping of the 
valence bands. As a result, the effective mass becomes anisotropic with applied stress. 
The constant energy contours of the first subband for (100) and (110) substrates are 
depicted in the figure. In Fig. 1.10, at a large body thickness, the stress induced hole 
mobility enhancement in (100)/[110] and (110)/[-110] channel directions is 
comparable due to the same bulk piezoresistance coefficients [29]. For a smaller body 
thickness, the quantum confinement effect plays a role and the energy difference from 
the uniaxial compressive stress and surface field is additive, which is responsible for 
the slight shift of the peak mobility. 
 
1.6 Summary 
The effects of channel/substrate orientation and uniaxial compressive stress on 
hole mobility versus body thickness in Ge-channel DG-pMOSFETs are investigated.

generation in a high-k gate dielectric is proposed to explain the instability modes.  
The devices used here are p-type MOSFETs with a polysilicon electrode and a 
HfSiON-SiO2 gate stack. The gate length ranges from 0.08μm to 1.2μm, and the gate 
width ranges from 0.16μm to 10μm. The physical thickness of the high-k layer and 
the interfacial SiO2 layer (IL) is 2.5nm and 1.4nm, respectively. The equivalent oxide 
thickness is 1.8nm. Detailed fabrication process and device characteristics were 
reported in [36][37]. To reduce the switching delay in characterization, our 
measurement system is computer-automated, including high-speed switches, an 
operational amplifier, and a digital oscilloscope, as shown in Fig. 2.1. The high speed 
switches minimize a switching delay down to microseconds between stress and drain 
current measurement. The detailed measurement procedures were described in 
[33][34]. Other measurement techniques, such as charge pumping (CP) technique, 
single charge emission measurement and carrier separation measurement are utilized 
to monitor charge trapping/detrapping and trap generation. 
In this work, the negative bias temperature induced drain current instability is 
first characterized in control SiO2 pMOSFETs. The BTI in HfSiON nMOSFETs and 
pMOSFETs are also shown for a comparative study. Then, the dependence of stress 
time, gate voltage and temperature on drain current instability in HfSiON pMOSFETs 
is investigated. We propose a bipolar charge trapping model along with trap 
generation to explain the observed phenomena. Finally, three characterization 
methods, single charge emission, charge pumping and carrier separation measurement 
are utilized to justify the model.   
 
2.2 Anomalous Turn-around in Linear Drain Current Evolutions 
The Vg/Vd waveforms in the transient measurement are depicted in Fig. 2.2 
during stress phase and measurement phase. Fig. 2.3 shows the evolutions of NBT 
32 
 
current enhancement has a positive dependence on stress |Vg| and temperature. The 
transition time for the Id,lin evolving from enhancement mode to degradation mode is 
mostly within seconds in the bias range of interest. Fig. 2.8 demonstrates the 
dependence of ΔId,lin on stress Vg at different stress times. For t=0.1s, a lower stress 
|Vg| (-1.4V~ -2V) induces a Id,lin degradation while a larger stress |Vg| results in an 
enhancement. This trend remains for t=10s, but the turn-around |Vg| is slightly 
increased. For a longer stress time (e.g., t=1000s), the dependence of ΔId,lin on Vg 
returns to a normal degradation mode as in SiO2 gate dielectric transistors, and a 
larger stress |Vg| results in a larger degradation [38][39]. The stress temperature 
dependence of ΔId,lin is shown in Fig. 2.9. For a short stress time (e.g., t=10s), ΔId,lin 
changes from negative at low temperatures to positive at high temperatures. But for a 
longer stress time (e.g., t=1000s), the Id,lin degradation increases monotonically with 
stress temperature. The positive temperature dependence of the Id,lin degradation in a 
high-k MOSFET can be realized due to temperature accelerated high-k/IL trap 
generation because of thermo-chemical reaction [40].  
 
2.3 Bipolar Charge Trapping Model 
In a negative Vg stress, two carrier injection processes affect Id instability, (i) 
valence band electron injection from the p+ poly-gate into high-k traps (Id 
enhancement mode) and (ii) hole injection from the inverted channel into high-k/IL 
traps (Id degradation mode). Therefore, available trap states in a high-k dielectric, 
either pre-existing traps or stress generated traps, and injected carrier fluence should 
be considered in a NBT instability model. Fig. 2.10 illustrates the energy band 
diagrams in equilibrium (Fig. 2.10(a)) and in various NBT stress conditions, for 
example, low Vg and low temperature stress (Fig. 2.10(b)), low Vg and high 
temperature stress (Fig. 2.10(c)), and high Vg and low temperature stress (Fig. 
34 
 
waveforms are shown in Fig. 2.12. The stress time (or exactly the charge filling time) 
for both cases is 0.2s, and the post-stress measurement condition is Vg~Vt to magnify 
the effect of single charge on drain current and Vd= -0.2V. In Fig. 2.11, trapped charge 
emission is manifested by a staircase-like jump in the drain current. For a pMOSFET, 
an upward shift (increase in |Id|) corresponds to a single hole emission, and a 
downward shift corresponds to a single electron emission. Notably, only trapped hole 
emissions are found for the low Vg stress (Fig. 2.11(a)) while both electron and hole 
emissions are obtained for the high Vg stress (Fig. 2.11(b)). This single charge 
emission result provides direct evidence of bipolar charge trapping in a high Vg stress 
condition. Fig. 2.13 shows the single charge emission induced current jumps in a 
post-PBT stress nMOSFET. Only three trapped electrons are observed and the 
post-stress drain current exhibits full recovery. It should be remarked that we did not 
observe any random telegraph signal at the post-stress measurement biases, indicating 
that the observed current jumps in Fig. 2.11 are attributed to injected charge 
emissions.  
We also characterize high-k/IL trap generation for low and high Vg stress by 
using a charge pumping method. A two-frequency (5kHz and 1MHz) technique is 
used to separate IL/Si interface traps (Dit) from bulk high-k traps (NHK) [42]. The 
characterization procedure is described in Fig. 2.14. The high frequency CP current is 
contributed by Dit and the difference between the CP currents of the two frequencies 
reflects high-k trap density NHK.

2.6 Summary 
Various NBT induced drain current instability modes in a pMOSFET with a 
HfSiON-SiO2 gate stack are investigated by using a fast transient measurement 
method. The drain current enhancement is observed in the initial stress period in a 
high stress Vg or at a high temperature. Electron trapping, hole trapping and new trap 
generation are found to be responsible for the drain current instability modes. The 
impact of stress Vg, temperature and stress time on NBT instability is characterized. 
The drain current instability modes are summarized in Table 2.1. In high |Vg| and/or 
high temperature stress, electron trapping into pre-existing high-k traps is dominant in 
the initial stress period, thus causing an Id enhancement. As stress continues, hole 
injection and new hole trap creation in HK/IL layers eventually become dominant, 
giving rise to a turn-around characteristic of the drain current evolution with time. For 
low Vg stress, the Id instability is dictated by hole injection throughout the entire stress 
period, and thus ΔId,lin decreases monotonically with stress time. In order to 
extrapolate a reliable NBTI lifetime, the above mechanisms should be carefully 
considered in a voltage-accelerated stress.

Two-dimensional device simulation is performed to calculate a temperature

3.2 Self-Heating Characterization  
Fig. 3.3(a) shows a normalized drain current (Id/W) versus Vd in small and large 
gate width devices in DC (Agilent 4156) measurement. The Id/W in a linear region is 
nearly the same, indicating no process variations in these two devices. However, the 
larger width device exhibits a smaller Id/W in the saturation region because of larger 
power consumption and thus a larger SHE. The reduction of the saturation current is 
attributed to self-heating induced mobility degradation [47][48]. Fig. 3.3(b) compares 
the Id/W from a DC and from a fast transient measurement for the large width device. 
A larger Id/W is noticed in the transient measurement because of the elimination of 
SHE. In addition, SHE is manifested in the internal voltage measurement results by 
Agilent 4156 and by the fast transient setup (Fig. 3.4). The larger VI in a non-SHE 
condition is attributed to a higher mobility in accumulation region, thus resulting in a 
smaller drift region resistance. A larger internal voltage in non-SHE condition implies 
a stronger hot carrier stress in the channel region. 
 
3.3 Degradation Characteristics in AC/DC Stress 
Two stress modes (max. IB, and max. Ig) are chosen in the study of hot carrier 
degradation in n-LDMOS. The Ig-Vg and IB-Vg of a n-LDMOS are shown in Fig. 3.5. 
Fig. 3.6 shows AC and DC stress induced Idlin degradations in the above two stress 
modes. Max. IB stress shows a slight difference in Idlin degradation between AC and 
DC stresses, implying that SHE is not important at a lower stress Vg. However, in 
maximum Ig stress, AC stress shows much more Idlin degradation than DC stress. 
Moreover, strong stress-frequency (Fig. 3.7(a)) and duty cycle (Fig. 3.7(b)) 
58 
 
is stronger in the non-SHE condition (Fig. 3.14). This feature also confirms our 
charge-pumping results in Fig. 3.10 and concludes a more serious Idlin degradation 
rate in AC stress (Fig. 3.15). 
 
3.5 Summary 
Transient self-heating effect in AC hot carrier stress in LDMOS has been studied 
by measuring an internal voltage. The extracted self-heating time is around 5μs. The 
AC stress at maximum Ig yields the worst hot carrier degradation because of the 
elimination of self-heating effect.

 Abstract—A novel random telegraph signal (RTS) method is 
proposed to study the lateral spread of injected charges in 
program/erase of a NOR-type SONOS flash memory. The 
concept is to use RTS to extract an interface trap position and 
to detect a local potential variation near the trap due to 
injection of program/erase charges. By using this method, we 
find that CHISEL program has a broader charge distribution 
than CHE program. A mismatch of CHE program electrons 
and band-to-band erase holes is observed directly from this 
method.

 I. INTRODUCTION 
 Two-bit/cell SONOS flash memory has been realized by 
storing bit charges in two sides of the channel by CHE 
program and band-to-band hot hole erase [1]. The control of 
program and erase charge lateral distributions of each bit is a 
major research thrust to improve cell endurance and scalability 
[2,3]. Attempts have been made in the past to characterize a 
trapped charge distribution in a SONOS cell. An inverse 
modeling approach is used to extract a program charge 
distribution from measured I-V characteristics [4]. Besides, a 
modified charge pumping (CP) technique [5] is employed to 
probe the lateral profile of programmed charges at the source 
and drain junctions separately. However, the inverse I-V 
modeling suffers from some limitations, for example, 
knowledge of precise device doping profile and lack of a 
unique solution. On the other side, the CP method is based on 
an assumption that interface traps have a uniform distribution 
along the channel [6], which is not correct in a buried diffusion 
bit-line SONOS cell. In addition, a charge pumping current is 
hardly sensed in a small area SONOS device.

II. MEASUREMENT RESULT 
Experiments were performed on SONOS flash cells with 
an ONO thickness of 8.5nm (top oxide), 7nm and 5.8nm, 
respectively. The cell size is W/L=0.11μm/0.1μm. The CHE 
program condition is Vgs=8V and Vds=3.7V. The band-to-
band hot hole (BTBH) erase is performed at Vgs= -4V and 
Vds=5V. 
A. Extraction of a Trap Position 
An oxide trap position in the channel can be extracted in 
a way similar to the method in [7]. The RTS capture time τc, 
as illustrated in Fig. 1, can be expressed below,  
<τc>=1/neσvth                                                                                                  (1)  
In this work, we will use RTS arising from charge 
emission and capture at an oxide trap to investigate 
program/erase charge lateral spread. First, we determine the 
trap position from RTS without the need to know doping 
profile. Second, because RTS is very sensitive to a local 
potential change near the trap, we can use oxide traps as 
internal probes to detect a potential change due to 
program/erase charges. Finally, by using this technique, we 
find that CHISEL program has a broader charge distribution 
than CHE program and a mismatch of CHE program electrons 
and band-to-band erase holes is observed. 
where σ is the trap cross-section and vth is the thermal velocity. 
The channel electron concentration ne is a function of gate 
overdrive, i.e.Vgs-Vts, where Vts is the channel potential at the 
trap position and is equal to Vts=(Lts/L)Vds. Lts is the distance 
of the trap from the source and L is the channel length, as 
shown in Fig. 1. 
Two different Vds (=0.05V and 0.3V) are used in RTS 
and capture time (τc) measurement. Note that the device is in 
the linear region at the measurement biases. Since the capture 
 
 
Fig. 6 compares the τc/τe in source side programming and 
drain side programming. The τc/τe remains unchanged during 
source-side programming, as expected, since program charges 
are near the source junction while the trap is near the drain 
edge. We also compare the program charge spread by CHE 
and CHISEL [10] in Fig. 7. The substrate bias is -2V in 
CHISEL operation. During CHISEL program, holes generated 
by channel electron impact ionization flow to the substrate and 
result in secondary impact ionization. The secondary electrons, 
accordingly, would be accelerated by the drain voltage and 
inject into the nitride layer. Fig. 7 shows that CHISEL has a 
broader injected charge distribution than CHE because the τc/τe 
and the potential change are larger at the same program ΔVT.

D. BTBH Erase and Program/Erase Charge Mismatch 
For comparison, we choose two devices with a respective 
trap position at 0.05L and 0.3L from the drain. CHE program 
and BTBH erase are performed. The τc/τe evolutions during 
program/erase  are shown in Fig. 8 (in the xt=0.05L cell) and in 
Fig. 9 (xt=0.3L cell). The τc/τe increases as program VT 
increases by CHE program and decreases by hot hole erase. 
For the point near the drain (i.e., xt=0.05L), the τc/τe curves in 
program and in erase match very well, suggesting that program 
electrons at 0.05L are totally neutralized by erase holes. In 
contrast, at the point of xt=0.3L from the drain, the τc/τe does 
not return to its original value after a P/E cycle. The larger τc 
/τe value during erase implies that program electrons (at 0.3L) 
are not completely compensated although the cell has been 
erased to its original VT.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 8 The <τc>/<τe> evolutions during CHE program and BTBH erase. The 
device has a trap at 0.05L from the drain. The <τc>/<τe> has the same path in 
P/E. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 9 The <τc>/<τe> evolutions during CHE program and BTBH erase. The 
device has a trap at 0.3L from the drain. The erase path of <τc>/<τe> is 
different from the program path. 
Fig. 10 illustrates the program/erase charge distributions 
and the band diagrams after program and erase. The trap 
position is at xt=0.05L from the drain in Fig. 10(a), and 0.3L 
from the drain in Fig. 10(b). In Fig. 10(a), the trap level 
increases with respect to the Fermi level due to program 
electron injection and decreases due to erase hole injection. In 
Fig. 10(b), the trap level increases due to program electrons, 
but is not affected by injected erase holes. The result in Fig. 9 
implies that injected holes have a narrower distribution than 
program electrons. 
III. CONCLUSION 
We propose a novel RTS method to characterize program 
and erase charge lateral spread in a SONOS flash memory 
without the need to know a doping profile. Since the RTS 
method is very sensitive to a local potential change due to 
program/erase charges, it can provide a better resolution than a 
charge pumping method or an inverse I-V modeling approach. 
An evidence of a mismatch between program electrons and 
erase holes is shown by this method.
