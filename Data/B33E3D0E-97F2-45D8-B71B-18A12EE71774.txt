perception, and visual field), digital-type speed anticipation reaction test and test of 
traffic regulation. Performance measures included hazardous errors (e.g. crashes) and 
traffic violations. Results of self-rating showed that the scores were higher in younger 
subjects. Then, female younger subjects had the highest scores than others. Higher 
test scores of driving regulations found in female subjects. For visual abilities 
measurement, younger subjects were better visual acuity and depth perception。
digital-type speed anticipation reaction test, effects of age and gender were not 
significant differences in slow speed anticipation reaction test. In fast speed 
condition, ，younger groups and female subjects were better responses than others. 
For correlation analysis, correlations for the relationships between tools of assessment 
were evaluated. The correlation coefficients for the relationships between variables 
were -0.329 (self-rating scores), 0.355 (errors), and -0.442 (speed anticipation in 
FAST). In the next year, the research project was followed the results of the first year, 
on road assessment was performed on training center of driver's license. Base driving 
skill included parking, traffic crossing, S-curve, upgrade, and stops behind crosswalk 
or limit line etc. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of these tools for evaluation of 
drivers’ abilities have been evaluated. Results of this study could be used in applied 
and renewed for driver’s license and improving traffic safety for older drivers.

2. Methods 
2.1 Participants 
Forty-four participants were recruited as paid volunteers for this study. The age 
of the subjects ranged from 20 to 62 years old. The sample consisted of thirteen 
females and 31 males. All participants had held a driving license and participated in 
the experiments after providing informed consents with respect to the investigative 
procedures. 
 
2.2 Self-rating form of questions 
For each of the following 15 questions, subjects need check the symbol of one 
answer. There are 5 steps for scoring: (1) write the check mark total recorded in the 
square on the question form in the square to the right; (2) write the check mark total 
recorded in the square on the question form in the square to the right; (3) multiply the 
number in the square by 5; (4) multiply the number in the triangle by 3; (5) add the 
results of sterp3 and 4. Interpretation of score denoted that the lower the score (0 to 15) 
is the safer driver; from 16 to 34 is meaning CAUTION and driver is engaging in 
some practices that need improvement to ensure safety. Finally, the higher the score 
(35 and over) is meaning STOP and driver is engaging in too many unsafe driving 
practices.

chin rest 1.2 m from the front surface of the screen near the opposite end of the table 
in the center of the edge line. Instruct the subject to sit on the chair; adjust the chin 
rest to such a height that the subject’s eyes are level with the moving light on the 
stimulus screen. The examiner, standing beside the testing apparatus, gives the 
following instructions to the subject:  
(a) Look at this light in the slit moving from right to left; 
(b) This light stops moving as soon as it goes behind the black screen; 
(c) You must imagine that it keeps on moving at the same speed behind the black 
screen until it reappears at the other side.  
(d) You must anticipate the time when it should reappear, and depress the key when 
you think it is time. Depress the key with your right hand. 
(e) You must watch the moving light carefully, and after it moves behind the black 
screen, you must keep your eyes moving over the screen tracing the imaginary 
moving light to estimate the traversing time of the light behind the black screen 
accurately. The correct speed could be divided into fast (1040 ms) and slow (2080 
ms).

3.3 Visual ability tests 
Table 6 showed the mean (SD) for depth perception and visual acuity on age and 
gender. Results showed that effect of age groups were found in visual acuity (F(1, 40) 
= 8.8, p<0.01). As expected, older subjects were lower visual acuity than younger 
subjects. For both eyes, the visual acuity of younger and older subjects were 1.15 and 
0.82, respectively. On the other hand, there were not significant difference in other 
visual abilities between age groups and gender. Mean visual field abilities on age and 
gender were showed in Table 7. 
 
3.4 Digital-type speed anticipation reaction test 
Table 8 showed the mean (SD) reaction time and errors by age groups and gender. 
Results of analysis showed that effect of age was found significantly in Fast 
conditions. The mean reaction time for young and older subjects was 818.8 ms and 
594.7 ms, respectively. Further, the errors were higher in older groups (445.3 ms) than 
younger groups (221.2 ms), significantly. On the other hand, the accurate for female 
subjects were higher than male subjects. 
 
3.5 Correlation analysis 
Correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between the study 
variables (Table 9). For age with correlations demonstrated significantly between 
these dimensions, the correlation coefficients for the relationships between variables 
were -0.329 (self-rating scores), 0.355 (errors), and -0.442 (speed anticipation in 
FAST). In addition, the mean number of errors reaction was negative correlations with 
speed anticipation reaction time in slow and fast conditions. The speed anticipation 
time was the higher correlation (0.738) between slow and fast conditions.  
 
4. Discussion and conclusion 
One of the purposes of AAA self-rating form is to help drivers become, if you are 
not already, an “activated driver.” An activated driver is someone who assumes 
responsibility for his or her own driving skills and who self-examines and compares 
his or her ability with the requirements for safe driving. The questionnaire drivers 
have just completed has helped drivers to locate those areas where drivers’ physical 
and mental abilities call for a change in driving habits and skills.  
Results of analysis showed that bout 16% subjects were difficult to decide when 
14
the muscle less elastic, and the lenses become thicker and less clear. A 60 years old 
driver must have 10 times the light required by a 20 years old. In addition, a 55 years 
old takes eight times as long to recover from glare as a 16 years old. Visual changes 
accelerate at age 55 years old. Drivers begin to miss objects that are not moving, such 
as pedestrians waiting to enter a crosswalk. Another visual ability that declines over 
the years in depth perception: how close or how far you are in relation to a car or 
object ahead. This capacity is especially critical when trying to judge how fast other 
cars are coming, which contributes to the problems you may have in making left 
turns.  
In addition, only 16% drivers check with their doctor or pharmacist about the 
effects of their medications on driving ability. The drugs that slow us down generally 
also slow down or reduce our capacity to make decisions and process information 
rapidly. And quick decisions are needed to maneuver a vehicle safety. Tranquilozers 
or cold remedies, such as cold tablets, cough syrup, and sleeping pills, can reduce 
driving ability. Combinations of drugs present another danger, because these 
combinations can bring on unexpected side effects and bad reactions. Another drug, 
which drivers may not think of as a drug, with this same effect in alcohol. Alcohol has 
a powerful impact on our total system, physical and psychological. Alcohol is 
probably the single most important human factor in fatal collisions for drivers over 65 
years old. 
About 18% subjects received the three or more traffic tickets, warnings, or 
“discussions” with officers in the past two years. Some older drivers are aware of 
their limits and cope with them. Others, however, overestimate their real capabilities 
and do not adjust their driving habits. The most cited problem of older drivers include 
failure to yield, failure to observe signs and signals, careless crossing of intersections, 
changing lanes without due regard for others, improper backing, and driving too 
slowly. Inattention and having too much information to handle at one time seem to be 
the root of most of these conditions. Thus, examine why you got the ticket or warning 
to determine the true cause. Did you miss a stop sign because you were inattentive or 
because you simply did not see it?  
Finally, the validity and effectiveness of these tools for evaluation of drivers’ 
abilities have been evaluated. Results of this study could be used in applied and 
renewed for driver’s license and improving traffic safety for older drivers.

 Therefore, an observational study to determine the 
relationship between vehicle speed and ramp ramps 
should be conducted, and the road-specific speed 
distributions examined.  
 
 
II.  METHODOLOGY  
 
A. Participants 
 
After removal of any instances of interference (e.g. 
traffic accident, gridlocks), the speeds of 3208 vehicles 
were measured. All drivers were unaware of their 
involvement in the study because the experimenters were 
unobtrusive. In addition, certain driver characteristics 
such as estimated age, gender, presence or absence of 
passengers and the type of vehicle were also assessed 
using a telephoto lens. 
 
B.  Apparatus and materials 
 
 A laser speed gun (UltraLyte LR400, Laser Tech, 
USA) mounted on a tripod was positioned at soft shoulder 
and aimed to measure continuously the speed of the 
vehicles while they passed 50 m in front of the stop line 
on middle way of three lanes. Prior to installation at each 
observation site the laser gun was calibrated to ensure 
accuracy. In addition, three cameras were also mounted to 
record: traffic-light status; and driving speed from laser 
speed gun. In addition, one camera with telephoto lens 
(120x Carl Zeiss) focused on windshield of vehicle to 
catch drivers’ characteristics (i.e. age, gender) and vehicle 
type. All video signals were recorded simultaneously 
using a multiplex processor on a digital recorder for 
further analysis.  
 
C.  Procedure 
 
 Observations were made at ramp metering of freeway 
with a speed limit of 40 km/hr (Fig 1). For each location, 
observations were conducted in non-rush hours (11:00 
a.m. to 3:00 p.m.) on weekdays. After observations, all 
traffic conditions were video recorded so that driving 
maneuvers could be subsequently analyzed. Two trained 
observers independently reviewed the video on frame-by-
frame. They recorded the approaching speed and 
estimated vehicle type and drivers’ characteristics (i.e. 
age, gender) in comparison to template (e.g. a man with 
55 years old). Thus, if a drivers’ age seems older than the 
template, he or she could be defined the older driver in 
present study. Data were only recorded when both 
observers agreed about the age bracket of the driver. For 
example, Fig. 3 presented that the younger male without 
passenger drove by van and vehicle speed reached on 60 
km/h during amber light. 
 
D.  Data analysis 
 
 Logistic regression belongs to the group of regression 
methods for describing the relationship between 
explanatory variables and a discrete response variable. A 
binary logistic regression is proper to use when the 
dependent is a dichotomy (an event happened or not) and 
can be applied to test association between a dependent 
variable and the related potential factors, to rank the 
relative importance of independents, and to assess 
interaction effects [15, 16]. Binary logistic regression is 
used in this study since the dependent variable Y (speed 
limit violation) can only take on two values: Y = 1 for 
speed violator, and Y = 0 for speed complier. Further, 
logistic regression coefficients can be used to estimate

freeway.

Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE IEEM
 ratio) selection process of logistic regression was 
followed (SPSS 13.0). Logistic model was developed by 5 
steps. Variables of vehicle types*traffic light on step 1, 
followed by age*passenger on step 2, vehicle 
types*gender on step 3, gender*traffic light on step 4 and 
age*vehicle types on step 5.  
 
 Table IV lists the model estimation and odds ratios 
properly adjusting other factors for significant 
independent variables in final step. The results showed 
that there are some interaction factors associated with risk 
of speeding including: driver age and gender (p < 0.001), 
gender and passenger (p = 0.01), and vehicle type and 
traffic light (p < 0.001).The odds ratio of 2.747 indicates 
that the risk of speeding in the sedans during green light is 
nearly three-fold. In particularly, there are larger speeding 
propensity (OR = 5.56) while the sedans during amber 
light. The results also show that the young drivers with no 
passenger were higher speeding propensity (OR = 4.16). 
In addition, there was the largest speeding propensity (OR 
= 24.36), when vans was driven by male. For interaction 
of gender and traffic light, male drivers were higher 
speeding behavior as expected (OR = 8.15) during green 
light. Both sedans and vans were driven by younger 
drivers have the larger speeding propensity (OR = 8.22 
and 4.88).  
 
 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
 
 Driving speed are critical factors associated with 
greater risks and the severity of accident consequences 
[17]. Excessive speed is a primary problem in traffic. 
Approaching an intersection can be considered a 
dynamic-control task that requires the timely detection of 
critical events and relevant changes in traffic 
circumstances. Decision making in response to an 
approaching intersection is one of the most critical driving 
maneuvers. At the most basic level, four different driving 
situations are encountered under ideal conditions when 
approaching signalized intersections: (1) proceeding 
straight through a green light; (2) braking and stopping 
before the onset of a red light; (3) choosing to proceed 
straight through or brake at an amber light; and, (4) 
accelerating when neither proceeding straight through at 
constant speed to clear the stop line before the change to a 
red light nor braking to a comfortable halt are possible 
[18]. In the last two eventualities, a rear-end collision may 
occur at critical junctures when two successive drivers 
make conflicting decisions, whereby the lead driver 
decides to stop but the driver immediately behind chooses 
to continue or accelerate through the intersection. Traffic 
control is a major contributor to speed choice, while 
drivers faced with a given signal must decide whether to 
cross or to stop. 
 While approaching a signaled intersection, speed 
control may be associated with number of factors, such as 
individual factors (e.g. gender, age), vehicle types, and 
traffic environment (e.g. speed limit, weather) etc. [19]. 
As in prior studies, speeding was associated with younger 
age, male gender and vehicle types [14]. The 
characteristics of speeders mimic those of red-light 
runners. Retting and Williams [20] reported that red-light 
runners were compared with drivers who had the 
opportunity to run a red light but did not, the law-breaking 
groups were younger and had more violations and crashes. 
 Liu [19] reported that prevalence of speeding was 
greater at the suburban intersection, despite the fact that 
the posted speed limit is higher than that at the urban 
crossroads. One reason for this disparity is that the 
suburban roads are designed to a higher standard and 
promote speeding. Another explanation is that there is less 
police intervention on suburban roads. In particularly, 
drivers have an elevated crash risk when driving on 
freeway interchanges compared with other sections of 
freeways [21]. In viewpoint for prevention of speeding, 
the traditional technique for controlling speeding is 
increased enforcement through police patrols, coupled 
with meaningful penalties. However, on high-volume 
urban sections, this requires a major and constant police
