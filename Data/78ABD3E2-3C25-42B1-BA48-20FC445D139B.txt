roughness by using the response surface methodology. 
The factors that the prediction model used included 
cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, concavity and 
axial relief angles of the end cutting edge of the end 
mill.  
The side milling operation is a sequence of 
many periodical and intermittent cutting processes, 
hence the end mill will be subjected to instantaneous 
torsion and bending. This makes the cutting 
phenomenon of the cutting process too sophisticated 
to be well described solely by tool geometry and 
various cutting conditions. In the past, few 
researchers study the phenomenon of side milling. 
To enhance predicting capability of machined 
surface roughness for the proposed model in side 
milling operations, this study introduces a powerful 
learning tool called abductive network (Montgomery 
et al., 1991). Basically, it consists of a number of 
polynomial functional nodes and organized into 
several layers. The best network structure number of 
layers, and functional nodes types can be 
automatically determined using a predicted square 
error (PSE) criterion (Barron, 1984). In other words, 
unlike the commonly-used regression and neural 
network, the abductive modeling technique can 
automatically synthesize the optimal network 
architecture instead of requiring the user to specify 
the network architecture in advance (Ravindra et al. 
1994; Fulcher et al. 1994). Furthermore, it has been 
shown that the predicted accuracy from abductive 
network is much higher than that from neural 
network. Therefore, in this paper, abductive networks 
have been proposed to predict machined surface 
roughness in side milling operations. Based on 
developed network, surface roughness under varying 
side milling parameters can be reasonably predicted. 
    In the following, the theory of abductive 
network is introduced first. The experimental setup 
for measuring surface roughness is described next. 
The succeeding section illustrates the developed 
polynomial network for predicting surface roughness. 
Then, experimental verification of the developed 
model is shown. Finally, conclusions are drawn. 
 
 
DESCRIPTION OF ABDUCTIVE 
NETWORKS 
 
The abductive networks proposed by 
Ivakhnenko (1971) group method of data handling 
(GMDH) techniques (Flarlow, 1984). In an abductive 
network, complex systems are decomposed into 
smaller, simpler sub-systems and grouped into 
several layers using polynomial functional nodes. 
The inputs of the network are sub-divided into groups, 
then transmitted into individual functional nodes. 
These nodes evaluate the limited number of inputs by 
a polynomial function and generate an output to serve 
as an input to subsequent nodes of the next layer. The 
general methodology of dealing with a limited 
number of inputs at a time, then summarizing the 
input information, and then passing the summarized 
information to a higher reasoning level, is related 
directly to human behavior as observed by Miller 
(1956). Therefore, abductive networks can be 
recognized as a special class of biologically inspired 
networks with machine intelligence and can be used 
effectively as a predictor for estimating the outputs of 
complex systems. 
 
Polynomial Functional Nodes 
    The general polynomial function known as the 
Ivakhnenko polynomial in a polynomial functional 
node can be expressed as

where kji xxx ,, are the inputs, 0y is the output, 
and ijkiji wwww ,,,0 are the coefficients of the 
polynomial functional node. 
Network Synthesis and Evaluation 
    To build an abductive network, a training 
database with the information of inputs and outputs is 
required first. Then , an algorithm for synthesis of the 
polynomial networks (ASPNs), called the 
predicted-squared-error (PSE) criterion (Barron, 
1984), is used to determine an optimal network 
structure. The principle of the PSE criterion is to 
select as accurate but less complex network as 
possible. To accomplish this, the PSE is composed of 
two terms, i.e., 
 
PSE=FSE+KP,                               
(2)                
 
where FSE is the average-squared-error of the 
network for fitting the training data and KP is the 
complex penalty of the network. 
The average-squared-error of the network FSE 
can be expressed as

desired value in the training set, and iy  is the 
predicted value from the network. 
  The complex penalty of the network KP can be 
expressed as

and helix angle of 35°. Fig.1. shows the schematic 
diagram of the side milling operations. A Surfcorder 
SE-1100 profilemeter measures machined surface 
roughness. The average surface roughness Ra is 
selected as the quantitative expression of machined 
surface roughness in this study due to its popularity 
in industry. For side milling, it uses a peripheral 
cutting edge of an end mill to achieve a relatively 
broad-range face milling on the vertical wall of a 
workpiece. The surface roughness generated by this 
process is indicated by two parameters: 
feeding-direction surface roughness and 
axial-direction surface roughness. The tester obtains 
these values by taking measurements at 15 different 
locations along feeding direction and axial direction 
respectively, and then taking average on these 15 
measured values to get a mean value as the average 
surface roughness Ra. In order to improve accuracy, 
the final value is the mean value of three values 
obtained from the experiments with the same 
parameter combinations. The measured values are 
listed in Table 3. 
 
CONSTRUCTION A PREDICTION 
MODEL OF MACHINED SURFACE 
 
Two abductive networks with their 
corresponding training database are described in this 
section. Their optimal forms shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 
3 are obtained by undergoing a training process using 
36 sets of experimental data listed in Table 3. The 
criteria expressed in Eq. (2) to Eq. (4) were employed 
to construct desirable network structures with optimal 
number of layers as well as optimal forms of 
functional nodes. The input parameters of the 
networks are cutting speed, feed per tooth, radial 
depth of cut, axial depth of cut, flank wear of 
peripheral cutting edge, and overhang length; the 
output parameters are feeding-direction surface 
roughness and axial-direction surface roughness. The 
network of Fig. 2 contains two hidden layers and four 
polynomial function nodes that include unitizer, 
normalizer, single node, and white node. The final 
mathematical forms via a network learning process 
are expressed as follow:

CONCLUSIONS 
 
The machined surface roughness of the side 
milling process is generally determined by the 
selection of the machining parameters. Therefore, 
how to master all the major factors and ensure high 
accuracy of the process is an important issue in 
machining. This paper presents the use of abductive 
networks for a solution. It is shown that the 
developed work can precisely model the relationships 
between the process parameters and surface 
roughness. Furthermore, the following conclusions 
can be drawn: 
(1) The developed models achieve high predicting 
capability on surface roughness, especially for the 
case of smaller flank wear of peripheral cutting 
edge. 
(2) The average error percentage between the 
measured and predicted data of surface roughness 
using the developed networks shown in Figs.2. 
and 3. are well below 15%. Hence, it can be 
concluded that the developed polynomial-network 
models possess promising potential in the 
application of predicting surface roughness in 
side milling operations.
