1. Introduction
A cable-body system consists of cable
and body towed by a towing vehicle, the
body and vehicle locating at the two ends of
the cable. The circular towing problem for
the flexible and inextensible cable is
important with both mathematical and
practical interest. Mathematically, the
interest arises because of the multi-valued
nature of a boundary value problem.
Practically, these extensive applications in
the underwater area are important. For
example, a ship towing an underwater
cable-body system moving in a circular path
could engage an intensive search in a
specific underwater area.
Previous investigations by Huang [1],
Skop [2], Skop and Choo [3], and Choo and
Casarella [4] predicted the steady-state
performance of a cable-body system towed
in a circular path analytically. The
investigators treated the cable as a
continuous structure with perfect flexible
and inextensible nature and obtained
numerical results for various towing media
by solving a boundary value problem with a
set of 1st order coupling differential
equations.  Huang’s studies to an airborne 
system found that multiple steady-state
solutions can exist and need further studies
under certain combinations of governing
parameters. Choo, on the other hand,
reported finding only single-valued
solutions by using water instead of air as his
towing medium. To find more exist
evidences of the multi-value problem, Skop
restricted his numerical and experimental
results to a vacuous towing medium and
showed that multi-valued solutions always
existed if the cable length and the rotational
frequency of the towing point were above
certain minimum values. Skop also
demonstrated experimentally that only one
of these solutions was stable.
Recently, there have been a number of
attempts to develop efficient methods for
obtaining equations of motion for cable or
chain systems. According to the report of
Choo and Casarella [5], more than four
methods are developed for the study of
cable dynamics, (the method of
characteristics, the finite element/segment
method, the linearization method, and the
equivalent mass method), however, some
correlation is certainly among them. Since
the advent of digital computers, the models
finite elements or finite segments, the most
versatile one, has been incorporated into the
analysis of cable or chain dynamics.
Winget and Huston [6], Huston and
Kamman [7], Wilson and Wang [8], and Leu
[9] presented a nonlinear, finite-segment,
dynamic model of a cable/chain, which
belongs to a discrete model consisting of a
series of rigid links connected to each other
by frictionless ball-and-socket joints. They
paid considerable attention to develop
various efficient methods including
formulations of governing equations,
loading conditions [10], and numerical
technique. The Newtonian Laws and the
Lagrangian equations are often adopted with
some other modified geometrical theories to
derive these equations of motion which are a
set of 2nd order differential equations,
usually nonlinear and coupling. An
efficient integrating solver that uses high
order Adem’s formula and has automatic 
step size adjustment plays an important role
to solve the initial value problems.
Therefore, based on the constraints on both
ends of the cable, the problems of a towing
cable or a mooring cable are discussed.
The present model to the equilibrium
motion of a cable towed in a circular path is
developed using the work by Skop and
Choo [3] as a basis with a number of
modifications. Assuming the cable as a
perfect flexible and inextensible slender
structure, Newton’s Law generates the 
equations of motion. The motion
configurations are essential in this
investigation to describe the relation among
those important parameters such as cable
length, cable verticality, towing velocities,
and the radius of the end point. Numerical
analysis including Runge-Kutta Method and
Shooting Method are used to solve the
boundary value problem.
2-2 Equilibrium Equations
Based on the assumption of a perfectly
flexible and inextensible cable, the vector
equations of force equilibrium generated by
Newton’s Law can be found as follows.

If a linear density and a cross-section

2-5 Numerical Methods
The boundary value problem can be
converted into an initial value problem for
which numerous numerical methods,
including integration schemes and root
searching schemes, exist. In this study, the
six boundary conditions (Eq. 17) at the
end-point (s=0) are regarded as the initial
values of the nonlinear and coupling
governing equations (Eq. 12) in which 0R
is a only unknown and has to be determined
first. Numerous guessing of 0R are tried
and regulated in the numerical integration to
obtain the 0R satisfying the only boundary
condition Eq. (18) at the tow-point.
Adem’s formula having automatic step
size adjustment and Runge-Kutta method
have been used to perform a numerical
integration. Also the shooting method, a
scheme for searching roots in a one-variable
equation, is used to correct the guessed
value of 0R so as to successfully satisfy
the boundary condition at the tow-point
( )s L . Sometimes more than one of 0R
is found in the analysis, in other word, the
boundary value problem with multi-valued
nature.
3. Testing Models
In this example of a cable-body system,
the upper tow-point move with a ship in a
circular path is examined. Since the main
part of the system is under water, it is
necessary to consider the significant effects
of hydrodynamic loads.
To determine typical values for the
cable-body parameters, a system consisting
of a diameter of 1/2 in. (1.27 cm) steel cable
with linear density per unit length 0.3 lb/ft
(0.447 kg/m) and a 1.2 ft (36.58 cm) radius
for a body weighting 250 lb. The values of
1.27 and 0.2, functions of Reynolds
numbers, are taken as the hydrodynamic
drag coefficients of the cable and the
spherical body, respectively. Effects of
various towing speeds, towing radius, body
weights, and cable lengths are obtained and
discussed in the following test examples.
The combination set of three body
weights ( 1 2 3, ,B B BW W W ), three towing
velocities ( 1 2 3, ,L L LV V V ) and three towing
radius ( 1 2 3, ,L L LR R R ) represented in Table 1
is used for various cable length parameters
( LRL / ) to complete the analysis of
cable verticality (vertical height or depth),
phase angles (measured from tow-point to
body-point), body radii of the lower body
point, and maximum tensions occurring at
the upper towed point as follows.

4. Results and Discussions
4.1 3 speeds and a certain body weight and
towing radii
A speed combination set consisting of
three speeds ( 3~1, iVLi ), a certain body
weight 1BW and towing radii ftRL 3000
is considered to complete the underwater
cable-body system for various cable lengths.
The numerical results including vertical
depths (verticality), body radius for short
and long cable length, are shown in Fig. 3a,
3b, 3c and 3d. Moreover, the results of
maximum tensions, and phase angles are
shown in Fig. 3e and 3f, respectively.
For a certain towing speed, when the
cable length is shorter than the tow-point
radius, a short cable ( 1/  LRL ), it is
easily found that the higher cable length, the
lower verticality and body radii, respectively,
in Fig. 3a and 3b. Hence, one of the
interesting aspects of the circular towing
problem is that, for certain values of the
governing parameters, the small values of
BR are not always accompanied by a large
results of phase angles, which are defined as
the angle differences measured between
both angles of horizontal projections of the
position vectors at tow-point and body-point,
are shown in Fig. 3f. It is found that the
phase angles are rapidly increasing with
both the increasing rotating speeds and
cable lengths.

4.2 3 body weights and a certain towing
speed and radii
A combination set of body weights
consisting of three weights ( 3~1, iWBi ),
a certain towing speed ( ktVL 32  ) and
towing radii ( ftRL 3000 ) is considered to
complete the underwater cable-body system
for various cable lengths. The similar
procedures to the previous are performed for
an investigation of the effects of the body
weight on the configuration and tension of
the cable-body system. The numerical
results, including verticality, body radius,
maximum tensions, and phase angles, are
obtained and presented in the following, Fig.
4a, 4b, 4c and 4d, respectively.
The fact of the minimum values of the
verticality is also found around 1 no
matter what the body weight is used. The
rotating speeds result in a steady state in
which the variation of body weights affects
not very much, especially for longer length
cable. Another fact that small body radius
always exist with the large verticality of the
longer towed cable is still found. Since the
speed is low, the end-body connected to the
longer cable obtains an equilibrium position
very near the rotation axis. It is important
for the cable-body system for the practical
application of an underwater search.
