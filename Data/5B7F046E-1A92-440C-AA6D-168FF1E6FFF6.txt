Low power consumption microspeaker using Cu/Ni 
magnetic nanocomposite [1-3] 
 
An electroplated Cu-Ni magnetic nanocomposite coil is 
developed and optimized for low-power electromagnetic 
microspeaker fabrication.  Via the incorporation of Ni 
nano-particles into Cu matrix, the magnetic property can 
be effectively modified from diamagnetism to 
ferromagnetism without having drastic resistivity increase.  
Fig. 1 shows the M-H loop of Cu-Ni nanocomposites 
plated with different line structures in the baths with 2g/L 
Ni concentrations.  It shows that Cu film has been 
modified from diamagnetism to ferromagnetism via the 
incorporation of Ni nano-particles.  The power saving 
ratio determined by the trade-off between the electrical 
and magnetic properties of Cu-Ni nanocomposite can be 
calculated as follows:

               (1) 
where PComposite/μr,Composite/kComposite, PCu/μr,Cu/kCu are the 
power consumption, relative permeability, and 
conductivity of the coil made by Cu-Ni nanocomposite 
and pure Cu, respectively.  By trading off the increase of 
magnetic flux density against the decrease of electrical 
conductivity of the actuated nanocomposite coils, better 
performance in terms of power saving can be found. 
  According to equation (1), the power saving can be 
estimated based on the measured electrical and magnetic 
properties.  From the calculation, the optimal process 
condition, i.e. 200μm wide line structure electroplated in a 
bath with the Ni concentration of 2g/L, can have the 
highest power efficiency.  According to SPL (Sound 
Pressure Level) versus input power normalized with the 
coil thickness due to the process variation in a frequency 
range from 1 to 6kHz as shown in Fig. 2, the composite 
coil can generate higher SPL than the Cu one under the 
same power input and averagely provide about 40% 
power saving than the Cu coil one for the same SPL 
output at 70dB.  The inset of Fig. 2 shows the 
photograph of as-fabricated microspeaker. 
In summary, we present a process optimization scheme 
for low-power electromagnetic microactuation using 
Cu-Ni nanocomposites.  The optimal condition, i.e. 
200μm wide inductive coil electroplated in a bath with the 
Ni concentration of 2g/L, can realize ~40% power saving 
of EM force driven speaker performed in a frequency 
range of 1 to 6kHz in comparison with the coil made of 
pure Cu for the same speaker design. 
 
Oxalis-like microphone for sound source localization 
applications [4] 
 
  A micromachined microphone with oxalis-like 
electroplated copper sensing diaphragm is developed for 
sound source localization applications.  The proposed 
microphone basically follows the concept which is a 
center-supported gimbal circular diaphragm structure 
proposed by Ono et al.[5-7].  However, instead of using a 
full circular diaphragm design, the oxalis-like leaf design 
combined with the employment of serpentine springs 
could resolve the problem due to the diaphragm 
disintegration which can make the sensing leaf more 
flexible to have larger deformation resulted by sound 
pressure.  Meanwhile, the serpentine springs to connect 
the leaves with each other can ensure the whole sensing 
diaphragm vibrates in-phase and reversed-phase modes 
like the auditory organ of the parasitoid fly.  Under 60dB 
SPL sound stimulation, about 70% of maximum 
displacement enhancement in a reversed-mode 
deformation can be obtained in comparison with the 
conventional design [8]. 
  Fig. 3 shows the as-fabricated biomimetic microphone. 
Three copper layers are used as the top sensing diaphragm, 
supporting via, and the other sensing electrode at bottom, 
respectively. The inset of Fig. 3 is an enlarged view on the 
central gimbal region showing the fully released device 
structure.  Fig. 4 shows the polar pattern of the 
normalized displacement of simulation and measured data 
by applying a pressure load 60dB SPL (0.02Pa) at 200Hz.

where P(t), a, c, m, τ, φt and φr, ω, ωt and ωr, and ηt and ηr 
are the sound pressure, the diaphragm radius, the radius of 
central support, the mass of the diaphragm, the time delay 
factor,  the translational- and rocking-mode phases, the 
operating frequency, the translational- and rocking-mode 
resonant frequencies, and the translational- and 
rocking-mode damping ratios, respectively.  Additionally, 
the performances of a biomimetic microphone can be also 
strictly compared using two mechanical indicators, the 
mechanical interaural intensity difference per area 
(mIIDpA) and the mechanical interaural phase difference 
(mIPD) [1], which can be obtained as follows:

For instance, the ipsi- and contralateral membranes move 
in opposite directions with equal amplitudes must have the 
mIIDpA and mIPD with the values of near 0 dB/mm2 and 
180°, respectively.  The presented hybrid design with the 
state-of-the-art characteristics of mIIDpA 2.7dB/mm2 and 
mIPD 155° has shown highly potential applications for the 
directional microphone with full space sensitivity.   
Meanwhile, for fairly comparison, two microphones 
with the hybrid and CP-S designs both having the same 
diameter and thickness are fabricated to validate device 
performance.  Measured resonant frequencies of the 
hybrid and CP-S designs are about 10 and 12 KHz, 
respectively, close to the CoventorWare, as shown in Fig. 
7 (a).  Better directivity and larger net displacement in 
the polar plot shown Fig. 7 (b) reveal that the hybrid 
design has a superior ability in sound source localization, 
i.e. about 36% sensitivity and 34% directivity 
improvements in comparison with that of the CP-S design.  
Fig. 8 shows measured acoustic responses of the hybrid 
microphone applied with 80dB sound waves in frequency 
domain and it evidences that the hybrid design has 
well-performance at 200Hz with significant phase 
difference.  Fig. 9 shows diaphragm displacement of the 
two kinds of microphones driven by a 80dB and 200Hz 
sinusoidal sound wave located at (r, θ, φ) = (24cm, 37°, 
0°).  The theoretical model for elaborating the dynamic 
response is likewise verified by experimental 
measurements depicted in Fig. 9.  Excellence match 
between calculation and measurement results indicates the 
accuracy of presented model and about 30% net 
diaphragm displacement improvement.  
In summary, we develop a hybrid biomimetic 
microphone with a central floating support.  Better 
acoustic sensitivity and directivity can be realized 
theoretically and experimentally.  The hybrid structure 
can not only inherit the advantages from conventional 
CP-S design, but also promote sound source localization 
sensitivity for MEMS microphones with a potential 
application for hearing aid devices.
