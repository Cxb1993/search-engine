ABSTRACT 
Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), and 
Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), upper-critical-solution-temperature (UCST) 
phase behavior with immiscibility-miscibility transformation in blends of poly(ethylene succinate) 
(PESu) with poly(lactic acid)s (PLA’s), such as poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA), poly(L-lactic acid) 
(PLLA), poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA), differing in D/L configurations and molecular weights were 
investigated.  All three binary blends of PDLLA/PESu, PLLA/PESu, and PESu/PDLA exhibit 
UCST behavior, which means they are immiscible at ambient temperature but can become miscible 
upon heating to higher temperatures at 240~268oC depending on molecular weights. The 
PLLAs/PESu blends at UCST could be reverted back to the original phase-separated morphology, 
as proven by solvent re-dissolution.  The blends upon quenching from above UCST could be 
frozen into a quasi-miscible state, where the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (12) was 
determined to be a negative value (by melting-point-depression technique).  The interaction 
between PDLLA and PESu in blend resulted in significant reduction in spherulite growth rate of 
PESu.  Furthermore, blends of PESu with lower molecular weight PLLA or PDLA (Mw of PLLA 
and PDLA are 152,000 and 124,000 g/mol, respectively), instead of the higher Mw of PDLLA (Mw 
of PDLLA=157,000 g/mol), are immiscible with UCST phase behavior, which are affected by 
molecular weights rather than the ratio of L/D monomer in the chemical structure of PLAs. 
The amorphous and crystalline phase behavior, spherulite morphology, and interactions 
between amorphous poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and poly(3-hydroxybutyric 
acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV), were examined using DSC, POM, scanning electron and 
atomic-force microscopy (SEM and AFM), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).  The 
PHBV/PVAc blend was found to be miscible with an almost linear Tg-composition relationship, 
indicating perfect homogeneity.  Interaction parameter by melting point depression is of a negative 
value of  = -0.32, also suggesting quite favorable interaction strength.  With the intimate 
interaction between the amorphous and crystalline polymers, effects of PVAc on the spherulitic 
morphology of PHBV are quite significant.  Owing to the higher Tg of PVAc (than that of PHBV), 
the spherulite growth rate of PHBV was depressed by increasing PVAc content in blends.  
Neat PHBV exhibits ring-banded spherulites when crystallized at Tc=60~110oC; however, 
with increasing PVAc content in the blends, the temperature range at which the PHBV/PVAc blends 
exhibit ring-banded spherulites remains similar but the regularity increases, and the inter-ring 
spacing significantly decreases.  In addition, the spherulite size and ring band patterns therein are 
strongly dependent on Tmax (190 vs. 220oC, respectively, for erasing prior nuclei), from which the 
blends were quenched to a Tc (60-110oC) for crystallization.  The SAXS analysis further indicates 
when crystallized by quenching from the lower Tmax (190oC), the lamellar plates of the 
PHBV/PVAc blends are thicker and a greater amount of amorphous PVAc chains is pushed to the 
interlamellar regions.

Mw-dependent as well as temperature dependent. As Mw of PLLA is lower, blend of 
low-molecular-weight PLLA with PESu or PEA may be different, and the blends may also undergo 
phase transformation with respect to temperature. 
Low-interacting blends of polyester-polyester, though immiscible at ambient temperature, may 
turn to be miscible at higher temperature. Such behavior of phase transforming from immiscibility 
to miscibility upon heating is known as upper critical solution temperature (UCST) phenomenon.  
Some classical blend systems, especially those blends comprising two polymers of similar 
structures, are well known to exhibit such UCST behavior, including blends of polystyrene (PS) 
with poly(-methyl styrene) (PMS) [2-8]. Such UCST may also exist in blends of polyesters with 
similar structures, such as PLLA with other aliphatic polyesters.   
Objectives of this study were to probe the phase behavior of blends comprising PLA and other 
polyesters, to clarify transition from immiscibility to UCST, and dependence of UCST with respect 
to constituent’s molecular weights or other structural factors. In addition, effect of optical chirality 
in PLA on phase behavior was also evaluated. Owing to the relatively low interactions between the 
polyesters in blends, expectedly slight changes in the chemical structures of either constituents 
(PLA or polyesters) might offset the interactions to an extent leading to different phase diagrams.  
For this purpose, PLAs of different Mw’s and/or chiral forms were used (PDLLA, PLLA, PDLA). 
Poly(3-hydroxybutyratric acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleratric acid) (PHBV) is a copolyester 
composed of hydroxybutyrate (HB) and hydroxyvalerate (HV) segments, which is a member of the 
family of polyhydroxyalkanoates, (PHA) originally introduced by ICI with a commercial name of 
Biopol [26]. Bacteria of Alicaligenes eutrophus was used of producing the monomers of 
hydroxybutyrate (HB) and hydroxyvalerate (HV).  PHBV is a copolymer made of HV and HB, 
still possessing capacity of crystallization at low HV contents.  As the contents of HV increases in 
the copolymeric PHBV, the Tg and Tm both decrease, which is commonly attributed to effects of 
co-crystallization and isodimorphism [27-30].  The HV-induced lower Tm, however, improves the 
processability and toughness in PHB. Yoshie at al. [31] proposed a model of sandwich lamella 
model and uniform lamella model to describe the structures in P(HB-co-HV) with HV greater than 
10 mol% or lower than 10 mol%, respectively.  Barker et al. [32] also pointed out that as HV is 
introduced into PHB, the crystallinity of PHBV copolyester is decreased.  Sawayanagi et al. [33] 
used 2D SAXS and WAXD analyses to explain that as the HV unit is introduced, the thermal 
stability of the PHBV spherulites may be degraded and lamellar thickness is changed.  Wang et al. 
[34] studied the ring-banded spherulites and PHBV and proposed lamellar twisting as a common 
cause.  
  Blends of PHBV with other semicrystalline polymers, such as PESu [35], PCL [36], 
poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu) [37], PLLA [19] had been studied, and the results suggested that 
most blends of PHBV with these semicrystalline polymers are phase separated with domains.  
Other blends involving PHBV are known to be miscible, such as PHBV with poly(vinylidene 
fluoride) (PVDF) [38], PEO [39], etc.  Systems of PVAc blended with other polymers have been 
widely studied, such as PVAc/poly(cyclohexyl methacrylate) (PChMA) that is claimed to be

to ensure minimal sample degradation. For measurement of Tmo (equilibrium melting temperature), 
samples were first heated to above UCST for achieving a homogeneous state (miscible), then 
quickly quenching (-320oC/min) to ambient to freeze into a quasi-miscible state, prior to heat at 
10oC/min in DSC for determination of melting temperature.  Scanning rate of 20oC/min was used 
for glass transition temperature of as cast or USCT-quenched samples. 
 
Morphology characterization and Growth rate measurements. A Nikon Optiphot-2 polarizing 
optical microscope (POM) equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) digital camera and a 
Linkam THMS-600 microscopic heating stage with TP-92 temperature programmer was used to 
observe the crystal morphology and transition of phase behavior of the blend samples.  Thin-film 
specimens for investigation on the phase behavior of the blends were sandwiched between two 
glass slides.  Samples for POM were solution-coated on glass substrate, covered with top glass, 
and pressed into films of proper thickness (ca. 10~15 microns).  For better color contrast, a 530 
nm plate was inserted in POM.  Thin-film specimens for investigation on the phase behavior of 
the blends were sandwiched between two glass slides.  
 
Atomic-force microscopy.  AFM characterization was made in intermittent tapping mode (Caliber, 
Veeco-DI Corp., Santa Barbra, USA) with a silicon-tip ( = 70 kHz, r = 10 nm). The largest scan 
range was 150 m × 150 m, with narrower areas of 5 m × 5 m for selective focusing. Thin 
films were deposited on substrates of glass slides, with an open face for AFM characterization. The 
top surfaces of film samples were exposed in the same way as that used in preparing the SEM 
samples. Preliminary optical microscopy (OM) characterization was performed to confirm presence 
of ring-band crystals in the samples intended for subsequent AFM characterization. 
 
Small-Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) Electron density differences between the crystalline and 
amorphous layers (lamellae) could be discerned using SAXS (Bruker SAXS) with source of IS, 
2D detector of VANTEC-2000 and Image Plate. The SAXS data were measured in a range of 0.1o – 
2.5o.

respectively.  Apparently, the as-cast PDLLA/PESu blend sample (top DSC trace) shows two Tg’s, 
which indicate apparent phase separation.  Heating to 140oC (which is still below UCST) does not 
lead to phase change, and the blend is still phase separated showing similarly two Tg’s.  However, 
by contrast, the PDLLA/PESu blend sample heating to above UCST and quenching from UCST 
results in locking into a homogeneous phase, showing a single Tg (bottom trace of Fig. 3-A) that is 
intermediate between the two constituents’ Tg’s.  Other blend compositions also exhibit similar 
phase transition from phase separation with two Tg’s to homogeneity with one single Tg after 
thermal treatments; for brevity, data are not repetitively shown here.  Analysis on the other two 
blend systems, shown in Fig. 3(B) and Fig. 3(C) for PLLA/PESu or PDLA/PESu=70/30, 
respectively, leads to same results as already discussed for PDLLA/PESu=70/30 in Fig. 3(A).   
 
Tg behavior of UCST-quenched blends 
 Although all three blend systems, when quenched from respective UCST, exhibit a single and 
composition-dependent Tg, their Tg-composition relationships vary slightly in curvature or extents 
of deviation from linearity.  Tg behavior of UCST quenched blends (to preserve their homogeneity) 
was compared for PDLLA/PESu, PLLA/PESu, and PDLA/PESu blends.  Most miscible binary 
blends follow the relationships as described by the classically known Fox equation [1/Tg = w1/Tg1 + 
w2/Tg2] or Gordon-Taylor equation [Tg = (w1Tg1 + kw2Tg2)/(w1 + kw2)].  Tg’s of PDLLA and PESu 
differ quite significantly.  However, for some blends whose two constituents’ Tg’s are spaced far 
apart by more than 50oC, they may exhibit asymmetric Tg-vs.-composition shapes with respect to 
composition with a discontinuity (cusp) point at an intermediate composition.[54]  Such blend 
systems have been discussed for blends of polycarbonate (PC)/PCL[55], poly(hexamethylene 
sebacate) (PHS)/PVPh[54], and poly(ethylene azelate) (PEAz)/PVPh[54] and PEI/PTT[56], etc., 
which are better fitted by the Kovacs Tg model based on derivation from the free-volume 
theory[57]. 
 In following equations, subscript 1 is designated for lower-Tg component, while subscript-2 is 
for higher-Tg component.  The value of fg,2 can be calculated to be 0.025, and other relevant 
parameters are listed in Table 1.  The critical temperature could be estimated to be Tc=19.2oC.

 Figure 4 shows Tg-composition relationships for (A) PDLLA/PESu, (B) PLLA/PESu, and 
PDLA/PESu blends.  Fig. 4(A) is the Tg vs. PDLLA composition curve, in which there exists a 
discontinuity point (cusp) at PDLLA=70wt% in blend.  Neither the Gordon-Taylor equation nor 
 10
of less refined crystals into more ordered lamellae.[59]  By all evidence, it is likely that both P2 
and P3 are related to re-organized crystal species.  All three peaks were used for extrapolation for 
comparisons.  Fig. 6(B) shows Tm vs. Tc plots for neat PESu.  Plot of Pa seems to parallel to the 
Tm=Tc line, while plot of P3 is horizontal to the x-axis.  Only extrapolation of P2 and/or P3 leads to 
gradual intercept with the Tm=Tc line to yield a plausible value for Tm0. 
 For consistency, the melting peak P1 of PESu or blends was consistently used for analysis 
using the Hoffman-Weeks equation.  Figure 7 shows (A) Hoffmann-Weeks plots for the 
PDLLA/PESu blends of five compositions (0/100, 10/90, 20/80, 30/70, and 40/60) 
melt-crystallized at various Tc; and (B) interaction parameter of PDLLA/PESu blends by the 
melting point depression method.  Fig. 7-(A) shows that extrapolation to Tc=Tm line yield values 
of equilibrium melting point (Tm0), which decreases with PESu contents in the PDLLA/PESu blend, 
as described by the following relationship:

where Tm0 is the equilibrium melting temperature, and  = l/l* is the ratio of lamellar thickness l at 
the time of melting to the thickness l* of the critical nucleus at Tc.  By inserting physical constants 
for PDLLA and PESu, the classical Flory-Huggins relationship gives estimation of interaction 
parameter between PLLA and PESu:

blend system, PDLLA remains amorphous and it is the melting point of PESu that was used for

 versus (12) by least-square method 
is shown in Fig. 7(B), from which the slope yields 12 value for PDLLA/PESu blend to be -0.73.  
From the classical Flory-Huggins theories, the mildly negative value of the interaction parameter 
between PDLLA and PESu provides evidence that the interaction, though not particularly strong, is 
nevertheless favorable for leading to a homogeneous state at above UCST.  Theoretically, 
interactions between PESu and the two crystalline forms of PLA (PDLA or PLLA) may be similar 
to those between PESu and amorphous PDLLA.  Practically, though, it would be experimentally 
difficult to determine 12 for either PLLA/PESu or PDLA/PESu, as at the temperatures of the 
crystalline state of PESu, PLLA or PDLA would be also crystalline, rendering the parameter of 
volume fractions uncertain. 
 
Intermolecular interactions in UCST-quenched blend 
 For IR characterization, blends were heat to UCST, then quenched to sub-ambient using liquid 
N2 to preserve their homogeneous state.  Quenched samples were placed in IR chamber for

Effect of Mw on UCST phase diagrams 
 Factors such as isomerism, tacticity, and molecular weight all may influence the phase 
behavior and scales of phase homogeneity in blend.  UCST especially may be influenced by 
components Mw.  Molecular weights of the two constituent polymers were expected to alter the 
experimental values of UCST measured owing to entropic effect, which can be quantitatively 
assessed as following.  Figure 11 shows phase diagrams with UCST and clarity temperature for 
PLAs/PESu blends of different molecular weights.  The phase diagrams for PLAs/PESu blends 
(where PLAs = PLLA, PDLLA, or PDLA) are constructed by plotting the clarity point with respect 
to composition.  PDLLA has Mw = 157,000 g/mol.  For the PDLLA/PESu blend, there exists a 
maximum at PDLLA/PESu =80/20 (wt%), labeled as UCST = 268oC.  Blends of PESu with PLA 
of three different Mw (124,000 for PDLA, 152,000 g/mol for PLLA) are similarly summarized and 
compared in this diagram, with the maximum UCST located at approximately the same 
composition.  Apparently, the blend of PESu with LMw-PLA (Mw=11,000 g/mol) has the lowest 
UCST.   
 
Effects of Amorphous Poly(vinyl acetate) on Crystalline Morphology of 
Poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid- co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid) 
 Phase behavior of blends of PVAc with the copolyester PHBV was first examined.  
Microscopy and thermal analysis characterizations were performed. Preliminary OM 
characterization on blends was performed to reveal phase morphology at different temperature.  
For brevity, OM micrographs are not shown here.  As-cast blend films showed PHBV crystalline 
domains in all blend compositions; however, upon heating to PHBV melting point or above, the 
blend (ca. 2oC/min) of all compositions turned apparent homogeneity with no discernible phase 
domains.  Cooling back slowly led to crystalline domains but rapid quenching froze the blends 
into a homogeneous mixture, indicating homogeneity free of phase separation. 
 Figure 12 shows (A) DSC thermograms for PHBV/PVAc blends of 8 compositions, and (B) 
Tg-vs.-composition curve showing an almost linear relationship.  The DSC thermograms for 
PHBV/PVAc blend of different compositions are 2nd scans after quenching the samples from 190oC 
for uniforming the thermal histories in DSC pans.  DSC analysis reveals excellent homogeneity in 
the blends with a single, composition dependent Tg for all compositions.  Fig. 1-(B) shows 
Tg-composition relationship for the PHBV/PVAc blend.  Most miscible binary blends follow the 
relationships as described by the classically known Fox equation [61] [1/Tg = w1/Tg1 + w2/Tg2] or 
Gordon-Taylor equation [62] [Tg = (w1Tg1 + kw2Tg2)/(w1 + kw2)].  Apparently, the Tg of 
PHBV/PVAc blend is elevated linearly with respect to PVAc contents in the blend.  By comparison, 
Tg of neat PHBV is -24oC, but with 50 wt% PVAc, the Tg of PHBV/PVAc blend is increased to ca. 
28oC.  The extreme case of k =1 for the Gordon-Taylor model leads to a linear relationship: Tg = 
w1Tg1 + w2Tg2, which means that blend Tg is linear sum of two constituents in blend.  This usually 
suggests a very good mixing between these two components (PVAc and PHBV).  The fact that the 
Tg data are fitted with the Gordon-Taylor theory model with the value of k being nearly unity 
 14
moves up with higher PVAc contents in the blends.  The growth maximum of PHBV/PVAc blends 
of 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30 compositions, are located at Tc=75, 80, and 85oC, respectively.  
Apparently, such effect is attributed to the miscibility and favorable interactions between PHBV and, 
PVAc and Tg elevation of the PHBV/PVAc blends by the higher-Tg PVAc component.  Di Lorenzo 
[66] in a review article pointed out that if the glass transition of the miscible noncrystallizing 
component is lower than that of the crystallizing component, then the spherulites will actually grow 
faster although the system is diluted, but the opposite is true if glass transition of the miscible 
noncrystallizing component (PVAc) is higher than that of the crystallizing component (in this case, 
PHBV).  Retarded growth rate of the blends by PVAc is one of the major factors for the noted 
changes in the spherulite morphology of the PHBV/PVAc blends.  WAXD analysis (for brevity, 
data not shown) showed that the crystal cells of PHBV/PVAc were the same as those in neat PHBV, 
indicating that the incorporation of PVAc might alter the lamellar pattern in spherulites but did not 
result in alteration of the unit cell packing in PHBV.  Similar results have also been reported for 
blends of PVAc with PHB in that addition of PVAc does not affect the crystal structure of PHB, but 
that the growth rates of PHB in the blends are decreased by PVAc [52,67]. 
 The crystalline phase in spherulites of the PHBV/PVAc blend and that in neat PHBV were 
analyzed for further discerning the interactions between amorphous PVAc and crystalline PHBV.  
Spherulite morphology of neat PHBV was examined.  Figure 15 shows POM graphs of ring 
banded spherulites of neat PHBV or PHBV/PVAc blends crystallized at Tc: (A) 60, (B) 80, (C) 
110oC.  The rings in the neat PHBV are fine and regularly circular at low Tc of 60oC; but the rings 
become coarser and less regular at the higher Tc (110oC).  Note that the ring patterns and 
temperature dependence for neat PHBV are similar to those for neat PHB [68-69].  The ring 
patterns for the PHBV/PVAc blends, however, differ significantly from those for neat PHBV.  
Spherulite morphology of blends at various Tc’s was examined for comparison with that of neat 
PHBV.  Fig. 4 (second and third rows) also shows POM graphs of the ring-banded spherulites in 
PHBV/PVAc blends (90/10, 70/30) crystallized at temperatures of Tc=100, 102, 104, 106, 108, and 
110oC.  The ring bands in the PHBV/PVAc (70/30) blend crystallized between 100~110oC are all 
regularly concentric, in distinctly different patterns from those in neat PHBV crystallized at the 
same Tc range.  Changes in Tg of blend is known to influence the growth rate, and the strength of 
interactions between neat PHBV and PVAc in blends may be among the major factors responsible 
for such differences in the ring band patterns.  PVAc in the PHBV/PVAc blend apparently elevates 
Tg, which in turn increases the Tc temperature range at which the ring band can be packed in regular 
concentric forms in the spherulites.  For examples, at Tc=100oC, the ring bands in neat PHBV (Tg 
= -24oC) spherulites are largely distorted to assume a pattern of thick irregular blocks, rather than 
typical concentric forms.  However, at the same Tc=100oC, the PHBV/PVAc (70/30) blend (with 
Tg = 4oC) exhibits regular and finely-spaced concentric rings. 
 Amorphous polymers in blends usually influence the ring patterns and temperature range 
within which ring bands can form in the spherulites.  Increase of PVAc wt% in the blends tends to 
improve the ring regularity and significantly decreases the inter-ring space, especially for blends 
 16
That is, a wider inter-ring spacing between the ridge and valley also comes with a greater height 
change from the ridge to valley.  The differences in the pitch and height drop are almost one order 
of magnitude for the same blend composition (70/30) crystallized at these two Tc =110oC vs. 60oC.   
 Figure 20 shows POM micrographs of ring-banded spherulite of PHBV/PVAc (70/30) in film 
on glass, which were tilted from 0, 15, 30, 45, to 60o in angle: (A) sample before etching, and (B) 
sample after etching. Etching was performed to remove preferentially the PVAc component using 
tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a washing-solvent.  Both unetched and etched blends show no variation 
or reversion of the color contrast of the alternating bands upon tilting from 0 to 60o angle of the 
sample on glass slide.  POM sample tilting experiments have been performed by Guo and Iwata, 
et al [70], where they claimed discovery of left- or right-handed lamellar twists in an eye-like 
region of banded spherulites of chiral poly[(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate] (PHV).  By tilting to as much as 
30o, they claimed that PHV lamellae exhibit opposite twist senses in the eye-like region versus the 
remaining area of the bands.  Objective of tilting in this study performed on the PHBV/PVAc 
blend was tentative and different, and the result could not be used for a positive confirmation for 
crystal alignment in the rings.  There is no alternating extinction dark to bright zone for the ring 
bands in the PHBV/PVAc blends; instead, the alternating ring bands are yellow and blue colors 
with no complete dark extinction of any bands.  
Figure 21 shows Lorentz-corrected SAXS profile of PHBV/PVAc blend crystallized at 80, 90, 
100 and 110oC, previously treated at (A) Tmax = 190oC, and (B) Tmax=220oC. Both Tmax and Tc 
influence the scattering characteristics.  For the PHBV/PVAc (70/30) blend treated at Tmax =190oC 
(Top diagram of the figure), the scattering peaks of PHBV/PVAc decrease with increasing Tc at q= 
0.72 nm-1 to 0.53 nm-1 for Tc =80 to 110oC, respectively.  Only one broad scattering peak is 
associated with the regular lamellar structure observed in the investigated blend composition, which 
shifts to a lower q value with increasing Tc.  When heated to Tmax =220oC to melt more nuclei in 
the PHBV/PVAc blend (bottom diagram of the figure), the blend exhibit similar scattering behavior, 
but the q value at the maximum scattering differ slightly.  For the blend treated at Tmax=220oC, the 
scattering peaks of PHBV/PVAc decrease with increasing Tc from q= 0.85 nm-1 to 0.65 nm-1 for Tc 
=80 to 110oC, respectively. 
The long period (L) and thickness of the crystalline phase (lc) in the blend crystallized were 
determined using one-dimensional correlation function (z), evaluated from the scattered intensity 
I(q) by the flowing equation [36,52,71-72]:

measured and Q is the scattering invariant [36,52,71-72]:

 During crystallization, the PVAc component may be partially excluded from the interlamellar 
region of PHBV.  In the blend, the amorphous PVAc may be located in both interlamellar and 
 18
to lower Hm and Tm peaks when compared at the same Tc.  This DSC result supports the SAXS 
analysis that lamellar thickness in the blends treated at the higher Tmax (220oC).  However, the 
larger inter-ring spacing for the blends treated at the higher Tmax (220oC) still cannot be directly 
associated with the DSC or SAXS results. 
 Tsuji et al. [73] have investigated PLLA lamellar structures by using SAXS, and they proposed 
various models to describe the results.  By following the similar approach and to summarize the 
lamellar structure variation with respect to influencing factors, Figure 26 shows schematic 
representation of lamellar structures of PHBV/PVAc blend= 70/30 treated to two different Tmax.  
At the same Tc after quenching from the lower Tmax=190oC, the blend crystallizes more easily and 
achieve higher crystallinity.  More amorphous PVAc chains are likely excluded to the 
interlamellar regions.  Thus, both crystalline (lc) and amorphous (la) are greater than those of the 
blend treated at the higher Tmax=220oC.  Such lamellar structures in semicrystalline polymers as 
effected by an amorphous miscible polymer are a common behavior, as earlier revealed in a 
copolymeric P(HB-co-HV) systems [31], or in a similarly miscible blend system of PHB with 
PVAc [43].

Symposium Honoring Professor Donald R Paul on the Occasion of his 70th Birthday 
S. D. Alexandratos and M. P. Dudukovic, Organizers 
ABSTRACT:  Ring-banded spherulites of neat poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) were observed by melt-crystallization at 125 to 130oC.  
The morphology of PHB/PLLA blend is ring-banded spherulite when PHB is in amorphous state.  If PHB and PLLA are both 
crystallizable, the blend exhibits ringless spherulites.  Ring bands and cracks in blends were monitored by selectively keeping poly 
(3-hydroxybutyric acid) (PHB) in blend uncrystallizable at high Tc temperatures (110oC or above) versus crystallizable at low Tc.  It was 
found that modes of segregation of PHB, in amorphous or crystalline state, during crystallization in the miscible blends may lead to 
different final morphology (ring bands, cracks, lamellar patterns, etc.) in the PHB/PLLA blends.  The formation of cracks in neat PLLA 
and blend system may be controlled by temperature induced shrinkage as well as additional mechanisms involving preformed ring bands 
in the spherulites. 
 
Keywords: PHB/PLLA blends, ringed spherulite, cracks. 
 
Introduction 
Formation mechanism of the banded spherulite is one of very important and interesting topics of semicrystalline polymer, which has 
been studied for a long time. There have been numerous investigations of morphological changes in compatible blends in which an 
uncrystallizable polymeric diluent is added to a crystallizable host polymer.  The addition of non-crystallizable polymeric diluents to a 
crystallizable host polymer can induce to form ring bands in miscible blends in a range of crystallization temperatures in which it does not 
normally occur, such as poly(-caprolactone) (PCL)/poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) system [1], PCL/poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) 
system [2-5], PCL/poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) [6-7], etc.  
For the PHB/PLLA blends, their miscibility, crystallization and melting behavior have been reported [8-10].  According to these 
studies, PHB is miscible with low molecular weight PLLA (Mw < 18,000) in the melt at 200oC over the whole composition ranges, 
whereas the PHB blends with much high molecular weight PLLA (Mw > 18,000) show biphasic separation. 
 
Experimental 
Poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) (PHB) and poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) were purchased from Polysciences, Inc..  Mw of PHB is 
500,000 g/mol with Tg= -3oC and Tm=176 oC. PLLA has a low Mw value of 2,000 g/mol.  For this low molecular weight of PLLA, Tg= 
45.3 oC and Tm=155 oC. The chemical structures of PHB and PLLA are shown in Fig. 1.  
 
 
Figure 1 Chemical structure of PHB and PLLA 
 
The only difference between the repeat units of PLLA and PHB lies just in the presence or absence of a single –CH2–   group in the 
chain backbone.  Both of them belong to the biodegradable polyesters.  
PHB, PLLA and blend (50/50) were prepared by solution-casting. Thin-film samples for polarized-light microscopy (Nikon 
Optiphot-2, POM) characterization were obtained by casting from 4 wt% polymer solution in chloroform on one side glass slide at 45oC.  
After solution casting, these samples were first melted at 220oC for 2 minutes between two glass slides, and then quickly quenched to a 
designated temperature for isothermal crystallization. POM was used to investigate the spherulitic morphology of isothermal crystallized 
sample.  
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC-7, Perkin-Elmer) analysis was performed to measure Tg, Tm and to study the thermal 
behavior of PHB, PLLA and its blends. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet Magna-560, USA) was used to identify 
bond stretching of the blend samples. 
 
Results and Discussion 
Table 1 show the morphology of PHB, PLLA, and blend crystallized from the melt at different Tc.  At low temperatures (100oC or 
below), neat PHB shows ring-banded spherulites. During crystallization for four hours, PHB is not crystallizable at high temperatures 
(110 oC or above).  Neat PLLA exhibits ring bands when the samples are crystallized by being sandwiched with top covers (glass or 
other covers), at Tc=125-130oC.  However, no ring bands are found at lower temperatures (120 oC or below).  The PHB/PLLA blend 
exhibits ring-banded spherulites when PHB is kept in an amorphous state during PLLA crystallization.  If PHB and PLLA are both 
crystallizable, the morphology of blend is ringless in spherulites.  It is know that the spherulites of PHB show positive birefringence but 
the spherulites of PLLA and its blends with amorphous polymers show negative birefringence [11].  
The size and band spacing of PLLA spherulite increased with an increase of crystallization temperature (Figure 2).  In addition, 
Figure 3 shows the morphology of PHB/PLLA spherulites crystallized at different Tc. Interestingly, ring-banded spherulites are present in 
the PHB/PLLA blend at temperature where PHB is amorphous and no rings appear in the neat PLLA.  At this condition, the morphology 
of PHB/PLLA blend is similar with ring-banded spherulites in neat PLLA.  The band spacing decreases with addition of the amorphous 
polymer.  The reduction of band spacing in the PHB/PLLA blends agrees with the result earlier reported by Gazzano et al. [12].  At 
temperatures where neat PLLA shows ring-banded spherulites and PHB is kept noncrystallizable, ring-banded spherulites can appear in 
the blend system.  The rings become irregular if the blends are crystallized at higher Tc.  
Figure 4 shows the melting behavior of PLLA, PHB and its blend after melt crystallization at 115oC (curves a~d) and then 
crystallized at room temperature (curves e~g). After crystallization at Tc for 1 h (curve b), PLLA shows double melting peaks and also for 
PLLA that crystallizes at Tc for one hour and then continue to crystallize at room temperature (curve-f).  Both of them have the same 
endothermic enthalpy, about 56.4 J/g.  It means that PLLA only crystallizes at Tc.  The double melting peaks are attributed to the 
melting/recrystallization mechanism, small and imperfect crystals becoming gradually more stable ones [13].  After crystallization for 
one hour, there is no melting peak that appear for neat PHB.  When it continues to crystallize at room temperature, it shows melting peak 
with endothermic enthalpy about 79 J/g. It seems that PHB is uncrystallizable at 115 oC.  From the IR spectra in Figure 5, it also shows

Surface vs. Three-Dimensional Characterizations on Self-assembled Lamellae 
beneath the Surface Morphology in Polyesters 
Eamor M. Woo, Yu-Fan Chen, and Siti Nurkhamidah 
Dept. of Chem. Eng.,National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan 
To be presented at  
6th International Symposium on High-Tech Polymer Materials (HTPM-VI) 
November 7~11, 2010, Xiamen, China 
Abstract 
 The features of multiple types of ring-banded spherulites in 3-D internal views vs. 
top surface morphology were compared and analyzed using polarizing/non-polarizing 
light microscopy (POM/OM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning and 
transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) on 
surfaces and interiors of spherulites. In comparison with the conventional surface 
characterization on thin films, a 3-D view was presented and discussed on the assembly 
of lamellae patterns in multiple types of ring-banded spherulites of poly(nonamethylene 
terephthalate) (PNT), which were cast and melt-crystallized in thin-films or thick bulks. 
The PNT thin films in 2-D growth have been earlier known to display both Type-1 ring 
bands as majority and Type-2 ring bands as minority on film surfaces; this study further 
shows that the interior of PNT bulk exhibits mainly Type-1 ring bands but the Type-2 
spherulites only in sporadically preferential locations of cross section of the bulk. By 
carefully differentiating the morphologies on the top vs. bottom surfaces (on substrate vs. 
open air side) and lamellar patterns of Type-2 ring bands in fractured interior surface of 
bulk-form PNT, it can be shown that the ring-band patterns are actually composed of a 
multi-layer structure with alternating crystalline and non-crystalline shells extending 
from inner side to outer surfaces. The interior-surface correlation analysis leads to a 
connection between the surfaces and interiors of crystal lamellae forming ring bands on 
surface. The exposed fractured surface displays concentric rings that appear as 
multi-shell cones. The spherulites in the bulk PNT are not always well-rounded spheres; 
instead, they appear as hemispheres owing to nucleation on the KBr side, and they 
assume multi-shell cones when thickness or growth is confined, as spheres sliced off 
both poles. This is first time reported that homogeneous vs. heterogeneous nucleation 
leads to two different types of ring-banded spherulites (single-ring and double-ring) in 
PNT.  
 Furthermore, these two different types of ring bands, respectively, were analyzed. 
Lamellar patterns beneath the top surface had yet to be revealed in bulk forms. Beneath 
the ring-band types on top surfaces of thin-film polymers, three-dimensional 
morphology of spherulites in poly(nonamethylene terephthalate) (PNT) in bulk forms 
were found to exhibit multi-layers of co-focal spheres with each layer composed of
