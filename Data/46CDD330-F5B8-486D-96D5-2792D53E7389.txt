Abstract-This paper develops a multiobjective evolutionary 
algorithm on the cloud computing environment to help planners 
solve multiobjective problems more efficiently and effectively. 
The cloud environment is emulated as a virtualized biological 
world with several isolated regions. The main population initially 
continues evolutionary processes as the most widely-known 
evolutionary algorithms. To yield both exploration and 
exploitation, two processes, such as migration and interaction, 
are deployed. In the process of migration, local optimal solutions 
can migrate to form new populations so that the search space can 
be expanded. To overcome the disadvantages in isolated 
evolutionary algorithms, the individuals in different populations 
will interact stochastically in the interaction process. Taking the 
advantage of cloud computing environment, planners can take 
less effort on deploying both computation power and storage 
space. Instead, the planners can focus on the design of encoding, 
crossover, and mutation. Also, it can further applied in various 
complicated applications more practically.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Emergency logistic is extremely important, when natural 
disasters, such as tornadoes, typhoons, tsunami, earthquakes, 
and fIre terror happen more frequently. When natural disaster 
occurs, most of these places will require a large quantity of 
resources, such as food, water, medical supplies, tents and 
clothes. However, these damages may destroy roads too. 
Under the circumstances, some places will be isolated. How to 
deliver required resources to these places as soon as possible 
becomes tedious. 
Traditionally, the emergency logistic can be categorized as 
several aspects. Some researches focus on road reconstruction. 
Some cluster-based researches focus on fInding clustering 
node. Also, some researches focus on routing selection. In 
general, the problem can be viewed as one type of vehicle 
routing problem (VRP). Since the VRP can be further 
categorized as VRP with pickup and delivering, VRP with 
LIFO, VRP with time windows (VRPTW), and capacitate 
VRP without or with time windows (CVRP or CVRPTW), the 
factors of the vehicle routing problems are time limitation, 
capacities, and path selection. 
Assume there is a group of commodities, the emergency 
logistic problem is to fInd out the vehicles and the routes to 
deliver the supplies. 
The feature of natural disasters is emergency. Natural 
disasters will cause the broken of transportation infrastructure, 
water and power supplies. Also, the natural disasters will 
cause the damages of lives, shortages of materials, broken of 
houses. When these damages occur, the rescuing processes 
should complete the tasks within the golden 72 hours. 
Furthermore, some diseases will occur after natural disasters. 
In government and non-government organizations, there 
are usually problems of unfair allocation and unsuitable 
vehicles for rescuing. Therefore, if there exist some 
mechanisms to integrate and allocate the information about 
rescuing resources when disasters occur, the rescuing process 
would be more effIcient and effective. 
The emergency logistics planning has been studied for a 
long time and very benefIcial to human being in real life. All 
of the problems are somewhat different from each case that 
mapped into different environment, population distribution, 
transportation network, relief needs and geography situation. 
These factors mentioned before make it hard to compare with 
each other. From the defmition of San Diego State University, 
the logistics section of the emergency plan contains the 
service providing of food, facilities, human resource, and 
transportation. From the related defInition above, this paper 
aims at providing the service at the same time. Those 
problems are usually mixed with many subproblems such as 
emergency rescue under the limited 72 hours for the 
experience of human physical ultimate, combining the VRP 
(Vehicle Routing Problem) [1]-[3] to dispatch emergency 
resource, limited capacity, the PDP (pickup-delivery problem) 
with different depots or destinations, time window constraints, 
that all make the problem even more complex. Based on the 
subproblems mentioned above, the research has several 
similar objectives such as saving time, lower economical cost, 
sending relief, saving lives, etc. Also, there are many types of 
solutions such as dynamic integer linear programming [4]-[10], 
Dijkstra algorithm [11]-[13], metaheuristic algorithms as ant 
colony and genetic algorithms [11], [13]-[17], immune 
intelligence [18], greedy method [19], game theory [20], fuzzy 
multi-objective program [4], [16], [21]-[23], etc. 
After the happening of a disaster, many processes need to 
be prepared and organized. Before the step of logistics 
planning, some literature try to fInd the best station to restore 
relief that locate near by the disaster area [24] or predict the 
amount of demand [4], [22]; In [23] Chen and Tzeng try to 
repair the broken transportation network to send relief. While

When considering the whole rescuing process, the available 
number of vehicles, the demand amount of relief materials 
should be considered. Hence, the highlighted problem here is 
to determine the exact number and the routing schedule of all 
vehicles from the supply point to all disaster points within 
their limited time periods. The notation is listed in Table 1.

Consider there are }' disaster points, or demand points, the 
set of the disaster points P can be denoted as P= {p; 1  :::; i :::; }' } .
Each disaster point p; has its associated information, such as 
identifier pid;, geographical position on the x-axis (longitude) 
and on the y-position (latitude), denoted as X;, and y;, 
respectively. 
Also, the disaster points can issue their demand amount of 
relief materials. Then, the supply points will collect relief 
materials according to the demands. Each issue can be viewed 
as a duty of delivering commodities or goods. Suppose there 
are fJ duties, each element g; in the set D= {d; 1 1:::; i ::;B} 
represents a duty. Various information associated with the 14 
duty are identifier did;, weight (or amount) of the 14 
commodity weight;, demand point or destination point dest;, 
expiration or expectation time expt;. Also, we use another 
information rcvt; to represent the practical receiving time of 
dest; for later use. 
Furthermore, suppose the set of a vehicles, denoted as 
V= {v;ll :::; i ::sa}. All these vehicles are departed from the 
supply point to deliver relief materials to demand points. 
Various information associated with the ith vehicle V; are 
identifier vid; and capacity capt;. 
The distance between two disaster points p; and Pi can be 
denoted as dist(p;, p). Since the terrain factors may affect the 
practical distance among points, the value of dist(p;, p;) can 
either be the practical length of the that connects p; and Pi' or 
just the Euclidean distance if the points reside on the same 
surface. 
Since the goal of emergency logistic is to deliver materials 
to disaster points within their expectation time, a routing 
schedule of the vehicles is used. Each routing schedule can be 
represented as a two-dimensional matrix 8 with axJ elements, 
as shown in equation (1).

S2,1 S2,b 
8= S;j (1) 
sa_I,1 sa-l,o 
sa,1 sa,2 sa,b_1 Sa,b 
where s;J represents the /,1 point assigned to the ith vehicle and 
s;J E G. The value of J represents the maximal number of 
duties assigned to each vehicle. 
There are several objectives to be considered and 
minimized in this problem. The first objective can be denoted 
as time objective. Since the relief materials should be 
delivered within their time period, the successful delivering 
can be evaluated by the following equation. 
J; (8)= L�I LJ=I xg) (2) 
wherex· -(IL {O if rcvt;J:::; expt;j 
I,} rcvt;j - expt;j otherwise 
The second objective can be denoted as capacity objective. 
Due to limited capacities of all vehicles, the amounts assigned 
to the vehicles should not exceed the given capacities. This 
can be evaluated by equation (3) . 
.t;(8)=L�IX?) (3) 
(2) {O if capt; 2: (J; wherex = 
I (J;-capt; otherwise 
and (J; = LJ=I wt;j. 
The third objective is denoted as the number of vehicles 
objective. In fact, the main goal is to estimate the minimal 
number of vehicles that can satisfy the demands issued by all 
disaster points. To evaluate the number of vehicles, equation 
(4) is used.

The algorithm then enter and continue the evolution process, 
including selection, crossover, and mutation. When the 
number of generations reaches the demand threshold, the 
algorithm stops and obtains the result.

IV. EXPERIMENTS 
In this section, the experiments are conducted. As shown in 
Table 2, the columns of pidi, xi, and yi are identifiers, 
positions on x and y axes, respectively with 50 disaster points. 
The first point with pid; equals 1 represents the supply point. 
For the sake of computation convenience, the distance 
between two points p; and Pi are the Euclidean distance 
calculated by the following equation 
dist(Pi, P j) = Jr-( X':""i--X- j-/-+-(-Y -i -- Y-j )

Table 3 lists the duty information issued by the disaster 
points. As mentioned above, since the first point with didi 
equals to I is the supply point, there is no duty issued from the 
first point.

into the step of logistics planning, In [4] and [5] they try to 
find the best rout path to distribute relief and some paper tries 
to both objectives of finding the rout path and evacuating 
wounded people. In the following paragraph, we present a 
brief review of the related literature. 
Typically, VRP indicates a closed route and with once visit 
constraint. According to the model presented by Ozdamar et al. 
[5], generates sets of "broken" routes and vehicles that do not 
need to return to depots. In addition, a distribution optimal 
model is constructed that not only commodity demand is 
known at the current date but also future requirement can be 
forecasted. This study proposed two sub-problems by relaxing 
the vehicle capacity constraints: (a) PI involves the 
commodities flow variables and (b) P2 contains the integer 
vehicle flow variables. These two problems were considered 
by using Lagrangean Relaxation Method, which is a relaxation 
technique to treat constraints as objectives and achieve the 
desired tolerance of user. Later years, Yi and Ozdamar [10] 
proposed an integrated capacitated location-routing model 
(LRP) with a multi-depot network flow based routing 
formulation for coordinating logistics support and evacuation 
operations. Ozdamar and Yi [19] applied the greedy 
neighborhood search method to build path, and compared to 
the mixed-integer-programming solver CPLEX 7.5 with the 
nodes number from 20 to 80. 
Cheng and Lu [25] used a framework of emergency 
logistics response model to make an operational analysis of 
the bottlenecks of the emergency logistics system, and put the 
key measures to achieve effective operation. 
For the minimum total distance and time limit constraint, 
some assist systems had been designed. Chang et al.[24] 
formulated decision program by applying geographic 
information system software to help locate each rescue 
resource storehouses, estimate rescue demand points and 
required amount of rescue equipment, and then develop the 
scenario. The program also uses a sample average 
approximation method to satisfy the expected objectives that 
considering: 
1) the structure of rescue organizations, 
2) locations of rescue resource storehouses, 
3) allocations of rescue resources under capacity 
restrictions, and 
4) the selection of rescue demand points and equipment 
according to distributions of rescue resources. 
Chiu and Chang [7] developed a cell transmission model 
based on linear-programming method. This model tries to 
solve simultaneous mobile mobilization destination, traffic 
assignment, and departure schedule for multi-priority groups 
(SEDTS-MPG) in response to a no-notice disaster. 
Yi and Kumar [17] proposed researches related to 
emergency relief operations with ant colony optimization 
algorithms. In the researches, ants that have been treated as 
vehicles use the pheromone trail of probability strategy to 
update to a well route path. There were 28 randomly generated 
test problems have been tested and compared to MIP solver 
ILOG CPLEX 7.5 [6]. Kanoh and Hara [13] designed the 
hybrid genetic algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm to use three 
objectives of route length, travel time, and ease of driving to 
choose a favourite route from the Pareto-optimal set. In the 
last, it was compared to the SOGA method. 
Sheu [4] made trend prediction and completed a full-scale 
emergency schedule and divided the system into five phases 
such as Time-varying relief demand forecast, Grouping the 
affected areas, Determination of distribution priority, Group­
based relief distribution, and Dynamic relief supply. 
By using the hybrid fuzzy clustering-optimization method, 
the system groups affected area and recursively uses 
multiobjective dynamic linear programming models to 
achieve co-distribution relief under several limitations. A 
simulation scenario of 24 demand nodes, 3 rescue centers, and 
6 supply nodes has been addressed in the experiment and 
compared to the existed results. In 2010, Sheu [22] extended 
the survey of relief-demand forecasting, affected-area 
grouping, and identified the urgency of demand dynamically. 
In the numerical experiment adopt the Nantou County to 
compare the simulated accumulated fatalities, casualties, and 
relief demand forecasted information with historical data. 
Traditionally, the exact amount of resources is difficult to 
estimate. When the disaster is urgent, it is very critical to 
decide the distribution of rescuing resources. Decision centers 
cannot predict the amount of dispatching how many rescuing 
vehicles to resolve. 
In [26] and [27], the problems of aircraft routing and airline 
crew pairing are solved using multiobjective genetic 
algorithms. However, as mentioned above, the number of 
aircrafts or airline crews should be given before the solution 
process. Motivated from [28], we would like to propose a 
multiobjective genetic algorithm with dynamic length. In 
other words, planners can obtain exact number of the resource, 
such as vehicles, aircrafts, aircrews, etc without pre-assigning 
a fixed value. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 
II presents the problem formulation. Section III describes the 
proposed methods. Experimental results are shown in Section 
IV, and the conclusions are given in the last section. 
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
When disasters occur, suppose the rescuing processes are 
held by an emergency center, or a rescuing center, the two 
main goals are to rescue the injured persons and deliver the 
relief materials. Here, we focus on the process of relief 
materials delivering. In general, there are several stages in 
relief materials delivering, such as information gathering, 
relief planning, rescuing resource gathering, and rescuing 
process. 
Suppose there are multiple disaster points (DPs) and one 
supply point. All disaster points firstly issue their demand 
amount of relief materials. Then, all relief materials are 
collected in one supply point (SP) for delivering to the disaster 
points. 
As shown in Figure 1, the supply and disaster points are 
represented in white and gray circles, respectively. The arrows 
are rescuing routes. There are three vehicles, denoted as Vi> Vz, 
and V3 take responsibilities to carry and deliver relief materials

problem is

Since the emergency logistic problem is a multiobjective 
problem with multiple conflicting objectives, the rank

defme A(fj, /z,.I3) as the vector of objective values of solution

of vehicle objectives.

where I:::: i:::: 3. 
III. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
To solve the emergency logistic problem, we use a 
multiobjective genetic algorithm. The chromosome encoding, 
crossover, mutation operators are described as follows. 
A. Chromosome Encoding 
In this paper, we propose a way to represent variable 
number of vehicles. In addition to normal genes, we adopt 
some separators to make each chromosome be divided into 
several sections. In other words, to solve the problem of 
unable to estimate the number of exact vehicles, a dynamical 
adjusting way should be used.

Figure 2. Chromosome encoding 
Since the number of initial vehicles is very difficult to 
assign, suppose there are P duties, the proposed algorithm 
firstly append (P-l) dummies, denoted as separators. 
As shown in Figure 2, the P duties and P-I dummies can 
form a total P+(p-I) = 2P-I chromosome. The lower part of 
Figure 3 is an example form of chromosome. The number of 
vehicles used in one chromosome can be viewed as the 
number of sectors in a chromosome separated by the 
separators. 
Figure 3 demonstrates some samples of chromosome 
representation. Suppose there are 7 duties with 7-1 = 6 
separators, due to different arrangement the 7 chromosomes 
can represent from one to seven sets by counting the number 
of groups formed by white cubes.

B. Crossover 
In this paper, the partial mapped crossover (PMX) and the 
reciprocal mutation operators are adopted.

Figure 4. Partial-mapped crossover 
Figure 4 demonstrates the partial-mapped crossover 
operator. First, one cut-point is chosen to make both parents 
into two separated parts, as shown in the left-hand side of 
Figure 5. The genes in the left of both parents are kept to form 
both offspring. On the other aspect, the right part of the 
offspring are formed according to the mapping list, i.e. to 
make each gene exists once. 
C. Mutation 
As shown in Figure 6, two genes are selected and 
exchanged randomly. If two duties assigned to different 
vehicles are exchanged, the routing schedule will be updated 
without modifying the number of vehicles. On the other aspect, 
if one duty exchanges with one separator, the number of 
vehicles may be changed. 
The flowchart of multiobjective genetic algorithm is shown 
in Figure 6. The algorithm acquires related data about disaster 
points, demand amount of relief materials, and vehicles. As 
mentioned above, suppose there are P duties, the chromosome 
length will be P + P - 1 = 2p-I.

Figure 5. Reciprocal mutation 
In the stage of routing schedule mapping and evaluation, all 
initialized individuals are evaluated by the objective functions. 
Also, these individuals are assigned using the rank dominance 
method described in Section II. 
Here, we use the tournament selection operator, which 
choose the better one as the parent from two randomly 
selected parents.

Figure 7. Convergence of all objectives 
According to the experimental results shown in Figure 7, as 
the iteration increases, the three objective values of expired 
time, exceeded capacity, and the number of vehicles can be 
reduced. However, since the objects are conflicting, the 
number of vehicles cannot be decreased to zero. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we develop a multiobjective dynamic length 
genetic algorithm to solve the emergency logistic problem. 
The proposed method can generate optimized routing 
schedules with minimal number of rescuing vehicles. Via the 
proposed method, the whole rescuing process can be more 
efficiently and effectively. 
In the future, we would enhance the proposed method to 
solve the emergency logistic problem with heterogeneous type 
of vehicles. Also, the proposed algorithm will be applied to 
emergency logistic problems with more complicated 
constraints.
