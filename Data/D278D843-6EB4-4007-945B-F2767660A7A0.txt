transmitted through the k-th subcarrier of an OFDM symbol. After N-point inverse fast Fourier transform 
(IFFT) and appending cyclic prefix with length 𝑁𝑔, the transmitted time-domain data symbol at the n-th

Assuming the multipath fading channel between the a-th transmit antenna and the receive antenna is made

B. STBC Interference Canceller 
1) Co-carrier Interference Modeling 
To calculate CCI noise, we need to know the CFRs of different transmission antenna pairs, i.e. 
H 
( )[𝑘 𝑚] ∀ 𝑘  𝑚 for 𝑎 𝑏  {0  } . Nevertheless, most channel estimator designs for STBC-OFDM 
systems are aimed to estimate the averaged CFR over two symbol intervals inside one time slot, as 
H̅( )[𝑘 𝑚] ∀ 𝑘  𝑚  in (21). The goal is to provide an efficient solution for any existing STBC-OFDM 
systems suffering interference, so we propose an algorithm using only the time-slot based CFR estimation to 
approximate the CFRs of the two symbol intervals inside a time slot. 
Fig.3 demonstrates the relationship between CFR tracking estimations in time domain, where 𝑴𝑡

the estimated CFR of a-th transmit antenna during the t-th time slot, and 𝑫𝑡

 denotes the

( )  represents our approximated CFR

model are proposed for time varying channel using only previous estimated information. They concluded that 
the 1
st
 order predictive model and linear extrapolation have better performance under time-varying channel. 
Moreover, by applying the 1
st
 order predictive model on 𝑼𝑡

( )
 simultaneously 
without violating the constraint in (22). As a result, our proposed approximation is given in (23) and (24).

2) Inter-carrierInterference modeling  
In time varying channel, CCI component is more significant than ICI component in STBC-OFDM systems. 
As a result, other studies for STBC interference cancellation target only on CCI and ignore ICI problem 
[4]-[7]. In this section, we propose a low complexity algorithm to model ICI by exploiting the information 
used for CCI modeling. In this way, CCI and ICI noise can be cancelled simultaneously with little overhead. 
The ICI component        is much smaller than      and is very difficult to be estimated accurately from the 
available time-slot based estimated CFR ?̅?( ); hence, we ignore        and focus on modeling 𝐼    only. The 
estimation of  ̅[𝑘 𝑚] defined in (18) requires the temporal variation complex gain inside each symbol 
interval, but the channel estimator provides only the temporal averaged CSI of a time slot. We adopt a LS 
fitted polynomial method [13]-[16] to model the detail of the l-th complex path gain as follows.

where 𝝁 
( )
 represents the modeled complex path gain at time sample index n, 𝜿( )[𝑙 𝑑] is the l-th path and 
the d-th order LS fitting polynomial coefficient in time domain, 𝑑  {0     𝑁𝑐   }, 𝜀 
( )[ ]stands for 
modeling error, and (𝑁𝑐   ) denotes the order of the LS fitting polynomial. It requires 𝑁𝑐 observations to 
solve this (𝑁𝑐   )-th order LS fitting problem, so we consider the estimated CFR of the latest 𝑁𝑐 time slots 
and group them as an observation block for each ICI modeling computation. An observation block is 
composed of 𝑁𝑐 time slots where the latest estimated CFR is in the (𝑁𝑐   )-th time slot. Then, combine 
(25) with the frequency domain channel matrix (4), we have

and   ̂    denotes the modeled CCI noise and 𝑘  𝚯. 
2) ICI from Data Subcarriers : 
According to (26), the estimated CFR matrix is composed of constant matrices  𝑑 which model the shape 
of Doppler spread and the variable part 𝑑𝑖𝑎 { ( )[ ∶  𝑑]} which is transformed from the observed CFRs. 
We further combine the linear transformation  (  ) with  𝑑 to obtain a new matrix 𝚽 which has constant 
entries and can be precomputed. The final expression of averaged CFR matrix is given by 
?̅?( )[𝑘 𝑚]  {

三、結果與討論 
I. SIMULATIONS AND DESIGN RESULTS 
The following simulations demonstrate the performance of proposed STBC interference canceller through 
the system described in Fig. 1. The STBC decoding flow is defined in Fig. 2. The flow control parameters of 
each decoding schemes are described in Table II. Note that the software scheme provides the best 
performance at the cost of more computing iterations while hardware version uses less iteration. The 
multipath channel adopts the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Veh-A channel model with 
relative path power profiles of 0, -1, -9, -10, -15, and -20 (dB), and the path excess delays are uniformly 
distributed from 0 to 50 sampling periods. Jakes model is also used to generate Raleigh fading environment.  
Fig. 8 shows the performance of 16QAM modulation at the vehicle speed of 240 km/hr. The two-stage 
channel estimator provides very accurate CSI which performs almost equal to the perfect channel estimation, 
but the bounding floor at high SNR caused by interference noises is very distinct. With the aid of our 
proposed software version decoding scheme, the error floor of the two-stage channel estimator significantly 
reduces by one order. BER of  ×  0 3 can be achieved in Eb N ⁄  of 30dB. The small gap between 
hardware scheme and software scheme suggests that hardware scheme is an economic choice for hard ware 
implementations. Moreover, the performance gap between floating point and fixed point simulations is less 
than 0.5dB. We can conclude that the implementation proposed in Section IV does not degrade the 
performance of the proposed algorithm. Fig. 9 shows the performance of QPSK modulation at the vehicle 
speed of 240 km/hr. Our proposed software scheme reduces the error floor of the two-stage channel estimator 
significantly reduces by 3dB. BER of 3 ×  0 4  can be achieved in Eb N ⁄  of 30dB. Because QPSK 
modulation is very robust in noise interference, the differences among the performance of software scheme, 
floating point hardware scheme, and fixed point hardware scheme are very trivial. 
Several STBC data detection methods have been studied in [5]. Fig. 10 shows the BER performance of our 
proposed method and other methods at Eb N ⁄  of 16dB, where simplified maximum likelihood (SML) 
method stands for the signal detection method proposed by [5]. Note that the symbol-interval based CFRs is 
obtain by (23-24) instead of the ideal channel estimation assumed in [5]. Our proposed scheme outperforms 
the other methods below the vehicle speed of 240 km/hr and has similar performance at higher speed.  
Table III compares the computational complexity of our proposed method and other data detection methods 
under our system implementation, where 𝐶𝑀 denotes the number of constellation points. A constant complex 
multiplier can be implemented as shift operations and additions, so it has considerably lower complexity than 
a variable complex multiplier.  
The result of hardware implementation is listed in Table VI. The proposed STBC interference canceller is 
implemented in 90 nm 1P9M CMOS technology. The area is 0.44 mm
2
 and equivalent to 109,299 gates. The 
proposed STBC-OFDM system samples received signal at 11.2 MHz, and the STBC interference canceller 
operates at 83.3 MHz. The power is equivalent to 1.45 mW from a supply voltage 1 V. The STBC decoder, 
the demapper, the received signal memories, and the memories storing the latest CFR estimations are shared 
 10 
From the system simulation results, we have shown that more than 2 times BER can be improved for 
16QAM at the vehicle speed of 360 km/hr with Eb N ⁄  beyond 15dB. In 16QAM at the vehicle speed of 240 
km/hr with Eb N ⁄  over 15dB, BER decreases from  0
 2 to  0 3 without using channel coding. The 
proposed design is implemented in 90 nm CMOS technology. The two-stage channel estimator and the STBC 
interference canceller require 863.9K gates and dissipate 45.16 mW at 83.3 MHz operating frequency with 1 
V power supply. Most of the gates of the proposed STBC interference canceller can be shared with the 
two-stage channel estimator design, and the overhead is only 4.9%. With verifications through design and 
simulation results, the proposed STBC interference canceller can provide a performance-improving solution 
for the STBC-OFDM systems in WMAN mobile wireless communication.

-學術成就面 
1.在高速行動環境傳輸之條件下，就各種通道估計及信號偵測演算法在傳輸效能、演算複
雜度及未來發展關鍵矽智產模組架構彈性與複雜度上做全面性的研究與分析，提出具高效
能且擁有可接受複雜度的通道估計及信號偵測方法。 
2.針對 IEEE 802.16e/m 標準提出在高車速環境下可行之通道估計及信號偵測方法，可應
用於 MIMO-OFDMA 模式，以提升 WiMAX 系統之行動接收能力。 
3.開發高效能的兩階段式通道估計器與低複雜度的 STBC 干擾消除器之基頻電路設計，並
可應用於 STBC-OFDM 系統架構。同時，此通道估測和資料偵測方法可適應於高達 240-360
公里/小時之車速環境，仍保有高傳輸效能。 
4.此設計在車速為 240 公里/小時、16QAM 調變且未使用通道編碼的情況下，BER 已可改進
至 10-3。 
 
-技術創新面 
1.提出應用於STBC-OFDM系統之高效能且擁有可接受複雜度之兩階段式通道估計器的演算
架構與電路實現。 
2.提出可搭配前項兩階段式通道估計器之高效能且低雜度之 STBC 干擾消除器的演算架構
與電路實現。 
3.有效整合分配兩階段式通道估計器與 STBC 干擾消除器硬體架構之共享模組，並有效降
