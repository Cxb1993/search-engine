Abstract 
This 3-year project will develop an 
integrated operation management system with 
order assignment, infinite and finite capacity 
planning, machine dispatching, and cell 
assignment to improve the productivity and 
competitiveness of color filter fabs.  This 
project can be implemented in three phases, one 
year for each phase.  The following shows the 
research results of the first year project. 
This study proposes an Order Assignment 
Management Mechanism (OAMM) to assign the 
orders to multiple color filter fabs. The objective 
of OAMM is to balance the load of each 
production resource on the planning horizon by 
taking into account the order’s batch size as well 
as the required technology and available 
capacity of each fab. OAMM consists of three 
modules: Order Priority Module (OPM), 
WIP-Pulling Module (WPM), and Order 
Release Module (ORM). OPM assigns different 
priorities to orders. WPM pulls WIP from the 
end of the process route to meet the orders in 
3 
describes the methodology of OAMM. Section 4 
presents the simulation and results. Finally, 
section 5 draws conclusions and provides 
suggestions of future work.   
 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Research related to production 
management in TFT-LCD industry is first 
reviewed. Next, research in the field of order 
assignment and capacity planning are surveyed.  
Jeong et al. (2001) develop a scheduling 
system whose problem is a parallel-machine 
scheduling with sequence dependent 
changeovers, multi-stage production, multi- 
objects, and the matching constraints for 
TFT-LCD assembly process. Jeong et al. (2002) 
develop an Available-To-Promise (ATP) system 
architecture whose function and information are 
comprehensively defined for TFT-LCD 
manufacturing in global supply chain 
environment. Lee and Lee (2003) suggest three 
kinds of control policies for TFT-LCD 
fabrication lines with re-entrant manufacturing 
process. A pull type control policy gives stable 
throughput and delivery satisfaction at a small 
cost and with less production. Shin and Leon 
(2004) present a scheduling methodology 
solving parallel machine-scheduling problem 
with family set-up time and due dates for 
TFT-LCD module process. Su et al. (2005) 
propose a linear programming formulation to 
optimize the plates-matching problem for 
various ports and an algorithm to reduce the 
number of ways for choosing different matched 
objects when the number of matched cassettes is 
large. Su and Yang (2006) first apply Genetic 
Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) 
to solve the post-mapping problem, and then 
propose a two-phased GA and SA to improve 
the performance of the initial population. The 
result shows that two-phased algorithm provides 
better solution than GA and SA. Wang and Su 
(2006) apply Hungarian method to solve the 
yield-mapping problem. The method provides 
an optimal solution to improve the cell process 
yield. Wang et al. (2007) use Mixed Integer 
Linear Programming (MILP) to construct a 
product mix for the TFT-LCD industry given the 
conditions of profit, productivity, raw materials 
supply, and market demand. Lin et al. (2008) 
develop a simulation model for TFT-LCD cell 
process and study the effects of the lot release 
time and dispatching rule. In order to improve 
the system performance, they propose a heuristic 
algorithm for lot release time and a Queue Time 
Maximum Un-matches (QTMU) dispatching 
rule for rubbing machines. Wang et al. (2008) 
analyze the impact of the Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) system on the inventory 
replenishment with (s, S) policy for TFT-LCD 
supply chain in Taiwan. 
Menon and Schrage (2002) develop an 
approach, based on the construction of tight 
sub-problem bounds, to solve decomposable 
dual-angular integer programs and successfully 
apply it to solve the order-allocation problem 
from the paper industry. Sambasivan and 
Schmidt (2002) present a heuristic procedure for 
solving multi-plant, multi-item, capacitated lot 
sizing problems with inter-plant transfers for a 
large steel corporation. Kerschbamer and 
Tournas (2003) study the consequences of the 
practice in a model where production is limited 
by capacity constraints and asymmetric 
information allows facilities to accumulate slack. 
The amount of slack per unit of output fluctuates 
pro-cyclically, and multi-plant firms use higher 
cost facilities as a threat against slack in lower 
cost facilities. Chen et al. (2005) develop a 
Capacity Planning System (CPS) considering 
5 
date, earliest due date, and random rule are used 
to assign priority for EDD, LBS, SBS, and 
FCFS, respectively, as shown in Table 2. In the 
example illustrated in Figure 5, EDD, LBS and 
SBS assign the highest priority (i.e., priority 1) 
to order 1 with batch size 2,500, order 6 with the 
largest batch size 4,000, and order 4 with the 
smallest batch size 1,500, respectively.

3.2 WIP-Pulling Module (WPM) 
Just-in-Time (JIT) production can lead to 
short cycle times, low WIP, and quick responses 
to variation in demand. WPM uses JIT’s pull 
concept to pull WIP on the shop floor to meet 
MPS. A WIP nearer to the end of the process is 
selected first, while the WIP nearer to the 
beginning of the process is selected later. Orders 
with higher priority will be fulfilled by these 
WIP earlier. According to this pull policy, a lot 
released to the fab earlier will go through its 
manufacturing process earlier. If the quantity of 
all WIP glasses exceeds the requirement 
specified in MPS, only those close to the end of 
the process will be selected and pulled out of the 
fab. However, if the WIP does not suffice to 
support MPS, ORM is called to release new 
glasses to the shop floor.

Following the examples shown in Figure 5, 
the results of ORM using LFU are illustrated in 
Table 3. Assuming fab 1 can process product 
types 1 and 2 while fab 2 can process product 
types 2 and 3. The available capacity for each 
fab is set as 90,000 pieces of glasses per month 
and each fab has current WIP of 40,000 pieces 
of glasses. The average cycle time of product 
types 1, 2, and 3 are 5 days, 6 days, and 7 days, 
respectively. Order release time starts from May 
1st, 2008. For each order, it takes 26 seconds to 
feed a piece of glass to the first step BM, and the 
total feeding time is the number of pieces of 
glasses in this order multiplied by 26 seconds.  
ORM releases lots to sequentially fulfill the 
requirements of different orders sorted by OPM.  
In Table 3, order priorities are assigned by LBS 
and these orders are sequentially assigned to the 
fab with the ability to process the product type 
and the least utilization when LFU is used. 
Firstly, order 6 with a batch size of 4,000 is 
assigned to fab 1 and fab 1’s utilization becomes 
44,000/90,000 after this assignment. The 
duration of release (i.e., feeding) time is 1.2 
days (26*4,000)/(60*60*24), so the end of 
release time is 1.2 days. Order 6 is of product 
type 2 whose cycle time is 6 days, so its PFT is 
7.2 days and the lateness is 0.0 days. Secondly, 
order 5 with a batch size of 3,000 is assigned to 
fab 2 leading to an utilization of 43,000/90,000 
for fab 2. The duration of release time is 0.9 
days (26*3,000)/(60*60*24). Order 5 is of 
product type 3 whose cycle time is 7 days, so its 
PFT is 7.9 days. The next order to be processed 
is order 1 with a batch size of 2,500 assigned to 
fab 1 resulting in an utilization of 46,500/90,000. 
Order 1’s PRT is 1.2 days (i.e., the end of 
release time of its previous order, order 6, in fab 
1) and the duration of release time is 0.75 days 
(26*2,500)/(60*60*24), so the end of release 
time is 1.95 days. Its cycle time is 5 days and 
the PFT is 6.95 days resulting in a lateness of 
0.95 days. The other orders are assigned to fabs 
in the same manner.

OPM, PMR, and SL, are significant in terms of 
the average lateness of orders. ORM is not a 
significant factor here because ORM releases 
orders to the fabs and estimates their PFT, while 
the priorities and sequence of orders are 
determined by the policies used in OPM.   
 
Table 6: ANOVA table of the difference between 
the average fab utilization 
 
Table 7: ANOVA table of the average lateness 
of orders 
 
As shown in Figures 9-14, the combination 
of OPM using EDD policy and ORM using LFU 
yields the best performance in terms of the 
variance of the utilization at each fab and the 
average lateness of orders. This is because EDD 
is effective in the reduction of order lateness and 
LFU can balance the fab loading resulting in the 
reduction of the variance of the utilization at 
each fab. With respect to the difference between 
the average fab utilization, OPM using LBS 
policy outperforms the others in several 
scenarios with heavy shop load.

(called Machine Capability Planning, MCP) is used 
to further determine the required number of machines 
of each type with capability constraint to minimize 
the equipment investment.  Data from real foundry 
fabs are used in a case study to evaluate the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed formulae.   
This paper is organized as follows.  This section 
gives an introduction to this research.  The next 
section reviews relevant literature.  Section 3 
describes the details of the proposed formulae.  Next, 
Section 4 presents a case study using the proposed 
formulae.  Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions and 
gives directions of future work.   
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Tompkins et al. (2003) summarized several 
quantitative algorithmic approaches based on 
material flow intensities or closeness ratings.  
Burman et al. (1986) indicated that spreadsheet and 
queueing network models are good for obtaining 
quick, rough-cut solutions that can be used to guide 
simulation studies.  Chen et al. (1997) proposed a 
three-phase approach that integrates initial design 
(using practical formula), rough-cut design (using 
queueing theory), and detailed design (using 
simulation) for wafer fab design.  Chen et al. (2007) 
proposed a practical fab design procedure, without 
considering machine capability, to conduct quick 
calculation of the required number of machines of 
serial processing type, the required number of 
vehicles in interbay material handling system, and 
the average wafer moving distance.   
Research in machine capability and dedication of 
wafer fab has received a lot of attention in recent 
years.  Akcalt et al. (2001) developed a simulation 
study considering machine dedication and showed 
that machine dedication significantly increases both 
the average and the variability of the cycle time.  
Chung and Huang (2001) developed a capability-
oriented loading allocation algorithm for wafer fab 
without considering the equipment dedication to 
balance loading.  Chung et al. (2006) proposed an 
integer programming model to solve the capacity 
allocation problem considering process window and 
machine dedication constraints.

Yi line yield of type i products in steady operations 
Zi,j,m batch size (in number of wafers) of j-th step of a 
type i product at a type m machine 
  
denotes an indicator variable that is equal to 1 if the 
j-th step of a type i product is processed at a type m 
machine and equal to 0 otherwise.  Ri,j,m shows the 
average rework rate of j-th step of a type i product at 
a type m machine, and Qi represents the required 
number (in number of wafers) of type i products per 
month.  I represents the total number of product types.   
3.3. Batch Machine 
The required number of batch machines of type m 
b
mN  can be calculated by Equation (4).  The formula 
for batch machines is similar to that for serial 
machines, except that both Pi,j,m and Ti,j,m need to be 
divided by (Zi,j,m* bmU ) indicating the batch process.  
Zi,j,m indicates the batch size of j-th step of a type i 
product at a type m machine.  Zi,j,m is shown in 
number of wafers that is the summation of the 
number of wafers of all lots in this batch.  bmU  
denotes the expected batch utilization in percentage 
for a batch machine of type m.   bmU  is 100% and 
50%, if this batch machine expects to process an 
average of full and 50%-full batch, respectively.  The 
expected utilization of a type m machine can be 
calculated by Equation (5), where mN
 
becomes smN  
for serial machines and bmN  for batch machines, 
respectively.

3.4. Determination of the Number of 
Machines of the Machine Type with 
Capability Constraint 
In semiconductor manufacturing, whether an 
operation can be worked on a specific machine 
depends on the machine’s capability.  “Capability” 
refers to the capability or ability of a machine for 
achieving a specific process.  Some machines may 
have only one capability, but others may have several 
capabilities.  Moreover, concerns for quality are such 
that different steps requiring the same capabilities 
should be processed on the same equipment with 
these capabilities.  This is called dedication.  The 
capability characteristic is typical in the operation of 
photolithography where the circuit patterns are 
transferred onto the wafer.  Photolithography is an 
important process, since meeting tolerances on the 
critical dimensions (e.g., line width and contact 
dimensions) and alignment with the previous layers 
is critical to the operation of the circuit.  As shown in 
Figure 2, steps x and z require the same capability C2 
that can be processed at machine types CM1 and CM2.   
To minimize the cost of equipment investment, MCP 
algorithm can be used to determine the required 
number of machines of each type with the capability 
constraint.  
Step 1. Read in the cost of the n-th machine type with 
capability constraint (On), the set of steps 
that must be processed by this machine type 
with capability c in the route of product type 
i (CSi(c)), and the total number of machine 
step capability machine type

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE 
RESEARCH 
Capacity planning is crucial to the investment and 
performance of wafer fabs in semiconductor industry.  
This research proposes practical formulae to conduct 
quick calculation of the required number of machines 
with serial and batch processing characteristics.  A 
heuristic algorithm MCP is used to further determine 
the required number of machines with capability 
constraint.  A real foundry fab is used as a case study 
to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the 
proposed formulae.  Based on the simulation results 
using an AutoSched AP simulation model, the 
proposed formulae and algorithm successfully 
calculate the required number of machines leading to 
the required monthly production target.   
This study can be extended in several directions.  A 
possible extension would be the consideration of 
material handling as the transportation time affects 
the occurrence of capacity requirement.  It is also 
important to investigate the effect of unpredictable 
capacity loss such as processing time variation to the 
formulae.
