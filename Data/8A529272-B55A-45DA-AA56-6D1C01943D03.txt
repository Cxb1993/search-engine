摘要
影響生物可及性的因子當中，土壤中的有機物含量及污染期限(ageing)為其中之顯要。本研究針對
土壤中為生物與有機碳成分及復育前之污染時間對柴油降解之影響，以實驗室規模類似生物翻堆
(biopile)的方法來進行總石油碳氫化合物(TPH)的生物復育研究。除了研究不同污染時間下是否有不同
的降解效果以外，又以分子生物技術及統計方法分析降解過程中的微生物族群之變化。採集不同有機
物含量的土壤，添加柴油至設計值後，分為稱為 P系列、STP系列、及對照組 STC。P系列的土壤配
置使其總有機質成分 SOM為 70.5%，STP系列的土壤配置使其 SOM為 9.0%，STC的土壤 SOM約 2.3%。
STC則繼續研究針對土壤被有機化合物污染的時間，稱為「風化」(aging)時間對柴油降解之影響，設
計成定量的土被油污染 38天(ST38)、101天(ST101)、及一被污染即開始以生物翻堆法復育的新鮮污染
土(ST0)。結果顯示，以第一階段的一階降解反應速率常數 k為例，含 SOM較高的 P系列降解速率最
低(0.0106 day/1)，而含 SOM較少的土壤，STP系列(0.0188 day/1)與控制組 STC(0.0133 day/1)，其降解
速率均較明顯高於 P系列。故可得知土壤中 SOM的含量愈高，生物復育過程中最重要的第一階段的降
解速率會愈慢。另外，新鮮污染的 ST0最快(k: 0.0245 1/day)，隨污染的時間增加，第一階段的降解速
率便降低(ST38的 k: 0.0128 1/day；ST101的 k值: 0.0090 1/day)。
進行微生物生態分析時發現，聚合酵素連鎖反應(Polymerase chain reaction, PCR)的反應過程中還發
現，土壤所含的 SOM會降低藥品的效果。所以在萃取 DNA之前會先以 Phosphate-Buffered Saline進行
洗土的動作，以降低所含可能的抑制物，同時因 P系列土壤所含腐質酸成分較高，又以Wizard DNA
Clean-Up system對萃取後的 DNA進行清洗的動作。復育完成之後，我們利用末端限制酶片段長度多型
性(T-RFLP)來監測各復育試驗中菌群之變化，藉由統計中的多元尺度化(MDS)、群集分析(Cluster
analysis)對 T-RFLP的數據進行多變量統計分析，得知高 SOM (P)與低 SOM中(STC、ST0、ST38、及
ST101)中的優勢菌種可被明顯分為兩個族群。且經由 ANOVA發現了 14種造成 P2與 ST系列成為不同
群集的優勢菌種。而此兩族群的共同之優勢菌種座落於 T-RFLP分析圖譜以 212(或 211)、215、230、255、
275(或 273)、及 510 bp，這些菌種因其 forward 引子末端標記了螢光而被限制酶MseI切下產生的片段
長度。若單純只針對 ageing 的影響來調查其復育過程中的微生物生態，MDS與群集分析的結果顯示生
物復育開始第一天時三種不同污染土 ST0、ST38與 ST101的細菌生態便截然不同，表示雖然受污染的
土壤質地相同，但隨著 ageing的不同，T-RFLP所顯示之細菌生態各異。污染期限相同的樣本幾乎都會
出現在同一個集群(cluster)內，表示降解過程中細菌族群相似。微生物生態結合統計分析的結果發現顯
示土壤有機質含量多寡、ageing 時間長短，甚至復育過程中 TPH降解的天數均會影響 TPH降解，微
生物生態扮演了重要的角色。
ABSTRACT
Early studies demonstrated that aging problem is more marked in soils with high soil organic matter
(SOM) than with low SOM. When dealing with hydrophobic compound-contaminated soils, SOM could affect
the bioavailability limitation and cause cross-interactions with the aging problem. When considerable
information on the bioavailability of single hydrocarbons of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been
available, less is known on bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons impacted by aging and SOM. This
4related to the percentage of SOM [10]. Early studies demonstrated that aging problem is more marked in soils
with high SOM than with low SOM [11]. When many studies focused on the effect of SOM and/or ageing on
biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and most of them analyzed only single PAH compounds [6]
[11], this study provided discussions about SOM and ageing separately, for hydrocarbon contaminated soils
remediated by indigenous microorganisms. In addition to the batch operation for TPH bioremediation,
molecular tools and statistical analyses were given for evaluation of microbial ecology.
We conducted two lab-scale biopile case studies operated for about over 200 days. Case I study was
dedicated to explore of the effects of SOM, and it was operated with P batch containing SOM 70.5%, ST batch
(SOM 9.0%), and STC (SOM 2.3%). Case II study was designed to distinguish the different bioavailability in
soils which were sealed in dark glass jars at room temperature for 0 day (ST0), 38 days (ST38), and 101 days
(ST101). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)
were applied to analysis of microbial ecology. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster
analysis were used to measure the influence on the soil bacterial communities during the remediation
processes. The results indicated the important effects of SOM and ageing on TPH degradability, and revealed
several perspectives regarding how the roles of the microbial community played in the remediation course.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. biodegradation experiments design
The P and ST batches in Case I were designed as soil mixtures combing peat soil with the soils from two
sites of underground storage tank (S site and T site). STC was simply the soil mixture from the two sites. The
SOM contents were designed as 70.5%, 9.0%, and 2.3% for P, ST, and STC treatments, respectively (Table 1).
The soil operated in Case II, ST0, ST38, and ST101 were obtained from the same source as STC in Case I.
Artificially contamination were conducted in dark glass jars at room temperature in order to create scenarios
of ageing 0 day (ST0), 38 days (ST38), and 101 days (ST101), prior to the biopile bioremediation was started
up (Table 2). The soil kept in the glass biopiles was turned over every other day. The soil samples were taken
periodically for moisture, pH [12], and TPH analyses.

62.4. Hydrocarbon fraction analysis
The concentrations of the total extractable matter and each of the fractions were determined using column
chromatography [14]. The hexane-soluble fraction, which contained the maltenes, was separated by
solid–liquid chromatography using a column (15 cm length ·1 cm diameter) packing with activated (overnight,
at 120℃) silica gel (100–200 mesh). A successive elution was performed using 60 mL of hexane, 60 mL of
60:40 (v/v) mixture of hexane/dichloromethane, and 60 mL of methanol. The fractions eluted with these
solvents belonged to saturated, aromatic, and polar hydrocarbons, respectively. The residual oil was
gravimetrically determined after the solvents were evaporated.
2.5. Total soil DNA extraction and purification
Due to the high content of SOM, prior to DNA extraction, phosphate-buffered saline was applied to soil
wash in order to remove potential inhibitor. DNA extraction was conducted by using UltraCleanTM Soil DNA
Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The commercial protocol including a
10-minute bead-beating step performed with a vortex was followed. About 0.25 g of soil sample was
employed. The extracted DNA was stored at -20oC for later analyses of T-RFLP.
2.6. T-RFLP analysis
Terminal restriction fragment lengths were determined using method adapted from Liu et al. [15]. The
bacterial 16S rRNA gene, extracted and purified from total soil DNA, was amplified with a bacteria primer
EUB338 (5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGC-3’) [16] and a universal primer 1392 
(5’-ACGGGCGGTGTGTGTAC-3’) [17]. The forward primer EUB338 was fluorescently labeled with 
6-carboxy-fluorescine (FAM). PCR reactions were completed in 50 μl volumes: consisting of primers of 2 μl 
FAM-EUB338 and 1μl 1392r (10 p mole each), 5 μl PCR bufer (10×) (Sigma), 4 μl of deoxynucleoside 
triphosphate (dNTP) (2.5 mM each), 2.5μl of the DNA template, and 0.25 µl of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara 
Shuzo Co. Ltd., Otsu, Japan). Amplification was performed using an automated thermal cycler (RoboCycler,
Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). The PCR reaction condition for ST soil was performed as: a hot-start at 94oC for 5
min (1 cycle); 94oC for 1 min, 58oC for 1 min, and 72oC for 1.5 min (30 cycles); 72oC for another 3 min (1
cycle). Amplified DNA was verified by electrophoresis of aliquots of PCR mixtures in a 1.6% agarose gel.
When an evident PCR product was detected, T-RFLP analysis was carried out with 50μl of the PCR product. 
The PCR product was then used for digestion with the restriction enzyme of MseI (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) at 37oC for 3 hours, after being purified by MontageR PCR Centrifugal Filter (Millpore, USA). The
fluorescently labeled terminal restriction fragments obtained after digestion were analyzed for gel
electrophoresis in the Nucleic Acid Analysis and Synthesis Core Laboratory (National Cheng Kung University,
Taiwan) to determine the size of fragments. The precise lengths of the T-RFs from the amplified rDNR were
determined by electrophoresis with an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Wellesley,
MA).
8freshly contaminated soil (ST0) resulted in the highest TPH removal percentage (87%), and the final TPH
concentration attained the soil and groundwater regulation in Taiwan (1000 mg/kg). Once a certain period of
ageing occurred (ST38 and ST101), the removal percentages became lower (71% and 58%, respectively) and
the final TPH concentrations were not able to be reduced to lower than 1000 mg/kg.

After 199-day operation, fractional analyses of hydrocarbons in ST0 were conducted in order to further
understand the degradation path. The result indicated that saturates and aromatics were reduced as usual, but
the polar fraction were accumulated. These results were in agreement with the other studies that saturate and
aromatic HC’s are usualy easily degraded, but the polar fraction is not [18]. The polar fraction could include
biodegradation metabolites, which caused an increase in their mass, which were presented as resins and
asphaltenes fraction, are highly resistant to microbial metabolism [18][19]. The results explained the chemical
fractions variation and demonstrated the refractory resins and asphaltenes persisted after 199 day (Fig 4.)

Since T-RFLP is robust in identifying relations among natural communities [20], a MDS plot was
completed to explore differences in communities (Fig. 6) by STATISTICA 7.1 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA). The sampling time for the analysis was determined as the first day of bioremediation, one day in the
fast degradation stage, one day when TPH was no longer be degraded, and the last day of the remediation (Fig.
2 and 3). In order to quantify the dynamic variation in the microbial community among the different
treatments or during the operation process, relative percentage abundance (Ap) of each T-RF was calculated as
Ap = ni/N × 100
where ni represents the peak area of one distinct T-RF and N is the sum of all peak areas in a given
T-RFLP pattern. The relative percentage abundance (Ap) of each T-RF was demonstrated in the past [21] [22].
In total, Ap of the 24 different samples (six treatments × four time-points) from the P, ST soils including STC,
ST0, ST38, and ST101 were calculated. For each of the batches, four sampling days during the remediation
were taken for the analysis. The Ap values were estimated for all T-RFs detected in a size ranging from 69 to
730 bp for a given T-RFLP pattern. When the MDS plot was completed, a cluster analysis was provided.
The results indicated a clear separation between the bacterial communities in P and ST soils. The result
was also consistent with expectations based on the physical conditions of the two soils: ST soils were 1:1
mixtures of sandy and loam sandy, and P soil belonged to peat. In addition to the texture, the two soils were
different in the content of SOM. Therefore, it can be concluded that soil texture and SOM could cause the
difference of bacterial community structures.
Fig 6. MDS plot for P soil (marked as P2) and ST soils (marked as STC, ST0, ST38, and ST101). The
numbers connected with the batch names are the sampling date during the remediation.
It would be interesting to locate the bacterial species who differentiae the two soil communities. Analysis
of Variation (ANOVA) listed the potential species with T-RF of 124, 212, 230, 255, 260, 275, 276, 278, 510,
513, 517, 526, 607, and 631 bp. However, the exact species names have to be identified through sequencing
and cloning.

bacterial community structure was found in P than in STC, according to the MseI TRF profiles of 16S rDNA.
Also, the two separate clusters in the MDS plot confirmed the dissimilarity between the ecology in P and ST
soils.
In addition to SOM in soil, we concluded that ageing time caused different bacterial communities, even the
TPH contamination and remediation occurred in the soil from the same source. The first evidence was shown
when the 1st remediation days for ST0, ST38, and ST101 on the MDS plot were substantially separate from
each other. Perhaps due to the different initial microbial environment, the following TPH degradability in the
three batches was affected. Most interesting finding was the bacteria community in ST101 located in one
cluster during the entire remediation course. It was evident that the community structure in ST101 was the
least dynamic one, and it could affected the TPH degradability, which was the worst among the three batches.
A slow responsive microbial ecology was formed, when the contamination from diesel was over 100 days.
The usefulness of T-RFLP method was emphasized as a robust technique in identifying relationships based
on composition among natural communities. T-RFLP has the capacity to explore differences in community
composition between environment with the need to separately examine individual members of the community
(by 16S rDNA gene cloning) [20]. It is particularly true when the T-RF’s results from the relative richness of 
phylotype can be calculated for statistical multivariate analysis, such as MDS and cluster analysis. Correlation
between soil degradability of TPH and the corresponding microbial ecology was not frequently discussed. The
present paper provided some insights about possible correlations. The results are anticipated to explain the
limited bioavailability due to SOM and ageing, when remediation hydrocarbon contaminated soils.
Sequencing and cloning will be the next focus to illustrate the bacteria species that played roles in the
correlation.

Benthic Fish of Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds Associated with Sediments
1. Problem define:
(1) Initial studies carried out at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfalls of
the Orange County Sanitation District and the Los Angeles County Sanitation
Districts in California indicated the presence of endocrine-disrupting compounds
(EDCs) in the sediment around the outfalls.
(2) Exposure of male California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) to the sediments
and extracts of the sediments in the laboratory caused significant elevation of the egg
yolk precursor protein vitellogenin (vtg), a protein normally found in reproducing
females.
(3) Quantitative tools for vtg and hormone measurement and a DNA microarray were
developed for a flatfish commonly found at the WWTP outfalls in southern California,
the hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis).
2. Questions raised in the study:
Are the responses seen in the initial studiessignificant and repeatable?
Are these responses due to wastewater discharges?
What chemical(s) are causing these effects?
Which exposure pathways are involved?
Are there any reproductive or population level impacts?

2. Focused on 4 issues relevant to environmental dredging
81. The use of a thin-layer sand cap (<6”in depth) has been employed extensively to
control the bioavailability of dredge residuals and for enhanced natural recovery.
Benefits of a thin-layer cap when compared to a thick-layer cap include reduced cost
and reduced environmental impact on waterways.
2. The hypothesis that pore water concentrations can be used to predict
bioaccumulation and cap protectiveness was tested.
3. Microcosm cells were used to simulate an aquatic environment inhabited by low
level benthic organisms, and different sand cap thicknesses (0-10 cm) were evaluated.
4. Pore water concentrations were measured using solid-phase microextraction fibers
and compared to the bioaccumulation found in the respective microcosm cell.
5. Results show that a thin-layer cap of a depth great enough to isolate the
bioturbation activities of benthic organisms from the contamination (in this case 6 cm)
is effective in reducing bioaccumulation, and accumulation of PAHs correlate
strongly with pore water concentrations.

1. A capping remedy has been selected to address polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
present in the sediments of a 26-acre lake in the northeastern United States.
2. The conceptual design for the cap, agreed to in a prior Consent Decree, stated that
the cap would be placed over the entire lake bottom, and consist of silty sand with a
presumptive thickness of either 10 inches (if geotextile is placed between the
sediments and the cap) or 12 inches and a minimum total organic content (TOC) of
0.5 percent.
3. A successful implementation must consider the potential for mixing of cap
materials and native sediments, the stability of the sediment surface during and
following cap placement, and potential water quality impacts related to cap
placement.
4. The pilot study design included the preparation of 1% TOC cap material slurry
on–shore using lake water.
5. The study area was divided into three contiguous sub-areas, with geosynthetics
placed in two of the subareas prior to cap material placement.
6. The following conclusions were drawn regarding the final cap design:
