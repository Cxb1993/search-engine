controlling cell behavior. Although all these features 
are in the nano-sized range which is much smaller 
than that of cells, the ECM function to organize cells 
in space and provide the environmental signals to 
direct site-specific cellular regulation and to spatially 
separate one tissue from another [10]. 
 In order to create an ideal scaffold for tissue 
engineering, it is important to imitate the structural 
dimension of ECM for being the basement and its 
stromal function. Electrospinning can fabricate 
porous scaffold with micro-/nano-sized fibrous 
structure and represent alternative approach for 
biopolymers processing with controlled overall 
morphology, porosity, and composition. Thus, 
electrospinning is a straightforward method of 
producing fibrous structure with fiber diameter 
ranging from 50 nm to several µm [11-14]. The 
potential of applying bionano-technology in tissue 
engineering is huge in that it cannot only mimic the 
nanosized dimension of natural ECM, but can also 
form a defined architecture to guide cell growth and 
development as needed. The established ‘‘contact 
guidance’’ theory illustrates that a cell has the 
maximum probability of migrating in preferred 
directions which are associated with chemical, 
structural and/or mechanical properties of the 
substratum. The arrangement of cells in two- or 
three-dimensional architecture is beneficial for cell 
differentiation, proliferation and functional longevity 
[15].  
 Bioresorbable polyesters, such as poly 
(L-lactide) (PLLA) or poly(butylene 
succinate)-co-(butylene adipate) (PBSA), have 
garnered wide acceptance for use in medical devices 
due to their excellent biocompatibility and 
biodegradability [16-18]. PLLA also exhibits 
acceptable mechanical properties, low toxicity, and 
well-defined, controllable, degradation kinetics [17]. 
Both polyesters and nano-sized fibrous matrix have 
been reported to serve as peripheral nerve conduit or 
function as a “contact guidance” for neurite 
outgrowth [19-22]. But, there is no literature reports 
how these nano-sized fibrous matrixes influence the 
expressions of genes involved in cell apoptosis and 
neurite outgrowth. The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 
cells triggered by NGF to differentiate toward 
neuron-like cell, has been widely used in vitro to 
study the neuronal differentiation [23, 24]. Two 
biodegradable synthetic polyesters (PLLA & PBSA) 
were electrospun into a nano-fibrous membrane as a 
matrix for in vitro culturing of PC12 cells and the 
expressions of genes involved in neurite outgrowth 
and apoptosis were investigated in this study. 
 
三、 研究方法 
 
Electrospinning of PLLA and PBSA 
 Poly L-lactide (PLLA, Mw=140 kDa, Tg 
60-62°C) was purchased from Biotech One Inc. 
(Taiwan). Poly(butylene succinate)-co-(butylene 
adipate) (PBSA, Mw=180 kDa, Tg -45°C) was 
supplied by Showa High Polymer Inc. (Japan). PLLA 
or PBSA was dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) 
or in the solvent mixture of CH2Cl2 and 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 8:2 (v/v). 
Electrospinning conditions were as followed: the 
delivery capillary has an inner diameter of 1 mm, a 
DC motor with 12.5 cm in diameter of stainless disc 
as a collector located about 15 cm apart from the 
capillary tip, feeding rate of PLLA or PBSA polymer 
solution set in the range of 1-10 ml/hr, and the 
applied voltage of positive and negative charged in 
the range of 7-22 kV and 2-8 kV, respectively. 
 
Characterization of electrospun membrane 
 Morphology of the obtained fibrous membranes 
was observed under SEM (S-2400, Hitachi, JAPAN) 
at an accelerated voltage of 15 kV. The pore size and 
pore size distribution of electrospun membrane were 
measured by Capillary Flow Porometer 
(GFP-1100AX, Porous Materials Inc., USA). For 
contact angle measurement, the sample was cut into 
circles of ca. 15 mm radii and put it on a pivoting 
sample stage, and a droplet of double distilled water 
(ddH2O) was dropped from a micro-syringe. The 
contact angle and surface tension goniometer 
(FTA188, First Ten Angstroms, USA) employ high 
resolution cameras and software to capture and 
analyze the angle formed between the ddH2O and 
sample interfaces. 
 
Biocompatibility test 
 For biocompatibility testing, mouse embryo 
fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from 
Bioresource Collection and Research Center 
(BCRC:60008/ATCC:CRL-1658, Hsinchu, Taiwan), 
and were seeded on the top of membrane in 15 mm 
culture well. These commercial culture wells were 
made by tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). They 
were maintained at 37°C in DMEM (Dulbecco's 
Modified Eagle's Medium, Invitrogen-Gibco, Grand 
Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS, Invitrogen-Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 
and 1% PSN antibiotic mixture (penicillin, neomycin, 
treptomycin, Invitrogen-Gibco, Grand Island, NY, 
USA), in a water saturated atmosphere of 95% air 
and 5% CO2. Culture plates were placed in an 
incubator for 3 days. The WST-1 test was used to 
estimate the cell viability. 
 
Cell adhesion and cell proliferation analyses 
 For cell adhesion and proliferation testing, the 
sample was cut into circles of ca. 15mm radii, and 
placed individually into culture well. After the 
Fig.1. Micrographs of various electrospun 
membranes. Coarse: (a) PLLA, (b) PBSA; Fine: 
(c) PLLA, (d) PBSA. 
 To investigate the influence of fiber in 
micro-/nano-sized diameter on PC12 cells growth, 
we fabricated two series of electrospun membranes 
using fiber with 10-folds differences in diameter. 
The presence of DMF in CH2Cl2 during the 
formation of electrospun membrane was also 
examined. The results showed that the critical 
voltage was closely related to the surface tension of 
polymer solutions. While, addition of CH2Cl2 and 
DMF, the surface tension of either PLLA or PBSA 
polymer solution increased linearly with the 
concentration of polymer solution. These results 
showed that a higher surface tension was detected at 
high concentration of polymer solution. So far, a 
higher voltage is required to keep a stable Taylor 
cone and to initiate the jet formation for further 
electrospinning process. In addition, polymer 
solution at high concentration has stronger cohesive 
force. Thus, the applied voltage must overcome the 
cohesive force to make nanofibers through drawing 
on the jet flying trajectories. The finest fiber 
diameter was estimated to be about 2-8 µm when 
PLLA was only dissolved in CH2Cl2. The properties 
of electrospun membranes were improved in the 
presence of DMF. Not only the diameter of both 
PLLA and PBSA fiber was reduced with the addition 
of DMF, the pore size of both scaffolds was also 
reduced. Therefore, scaffolds with a pore size of 4-5 
µm that was far smaller than the cell size, may be a 
better choice as the tissue barrier. On the other hand, 
membranes with larger pore size surrounded by fiber 
with larger diameter may be a better choice as tissue 
regenerative matrix for cell proliferation. The 
morphology of electrospun fibrous membrane is 
similar to the basal layer of the neural tube, so the 
contact guidance of fine axon should be affected by 
the fiber diameter of electrospun membrane. Two 
kinds of electrospun membrane with different fiber 
diameter were selected to investigate this effect on 
axon growth. Therefore, the fiber diameters of 
generated coarse and fine electrospun membranes 
were ca. 5000 nanometers and 500 nanometers, 
respectively, as shown in figure 1 and were selected 
for further experiments.  
 
Cell behavior on electrospun membrane 
 The addition of nerve growth factor (NGF) 
caused morphological changes in PC12 cells from 
undifferentiated round-shape to differentiated 
polygonal-shape as shown in Fig. 2. In additional, 
low serum supplement has been reported to cause 
PC12 cells remained rounded phenotype as shown in 
Fig. 2 (a). The addition of NGF triggered membrane 
reorganization with microspikes structure on the 
surface of PC12 cells (Fig. 2b). On day 8 post NGF 
treatment, more filopodia extended structures were 
found on the differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 2c), 
indicating PC12 cells were differentiated toward 
neuronal-like cells with out-growth neurite upon 
NGF treatment. 
 
 
Fig.2. Micrograph of PC12 cells (a) without NGF, 
with NGF for (b) 3 days, (c) 8 days on TCPS by 
stereo microscope; with NGF for (d) 8 days on 
fine PBSA electrospun membrane by 
epi-fluorescent microscope. Magnifications of all 
images are 560X. 
 
 
Fig.3. Cell adhesion of PC12 cells on TCPS and 
various electrospun membranes without NGF. 
Initial seeded cell density was 1×106 cells/mL. 
 
 Furthermore, the adhesion of PC12 cells on 
generated membrane was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 
3, regardless of membrane composed of coarse or 
fine fibers, cell attachment on electrospun PLLA 
membrane was in a greater extent than that on 
electrospun PBSA membrane, but it was barely 
equal to that on TCPS. This may be due to the 
greater contact angle (72.9°) of PLLA compared to 
that (59.1°) of PBSA which facilitated PC12 cells 
spreading. Although cell attachment on electrospun 
PBSA membrane was found to be the lowest among 
architecture may provide better environment to 
initiate PC12 cells differentiation even without NGF 
signal. The GAP43 expression in cells grown on 
coarse PLLA membrane showed the 
NGF-responsiveness, while no such NGF-induced 
GAP43 expression but a suppressed expression was 
detected in cells grown on coarse PBSA membrane. 
In addition, PLLA and PBSA electrospun 
membranes showed compelling influence on MAP2 
gene expression of cultured PC12 cells, and their 
responsiveness to NGF stimulation. Overall, the 
electrospun PLLA seems to be better membrane 
matrix for PC12 cells differentiated toward 
neuronal-like cells. That the higher crystallinity of 
the homopolymer PLLA compared to the block 
copolymer characteristic of PBSA, may provide 
more contact angles forming micro-environment to 
facilitate the extended neurite development. On the 
other hand, the expressions of apoptotic genes (Bax, 
Fas) and anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) in 
PC12 cells showed no significant difference with 
and without NGF stimulation in either cultured 
conditions. These data suggested that the application 
of electrospun membranes for in vitro cultivation 
and differentiation induction of PC12 cells may not 
trigger apoptosis-related cell behaviors.

INTRODUCTION: Biodegradable synthetic 
polyester were utilized as peripheral nerve conduit 
and nano-sized fibrous matrix having a “contact 
guidance” effect for neurite outgrowth have been 
reported [1]. But, there is no literature reports how 
these nano-sized fibrous matrixes regulate the 
nerve cell gene expression to influence the 
following neurite outgrowth. Two biodegradable 
synthetic polyesters (PLLA & PBSA) were 
electrospun into a nano-fibrous membrane as a 
nerve cell (PC12 cell line) culture matrix to 
investigate the neurite outgrowth and apoptosis 
related gene regulation in this study.  
METHODS: PLLA (Mw=140 kDa, Tg 60-62°C) 
or PBSA (Mw=180 kDa, Tg -45°C) was dissolved 
in CH2Cl2 or in the solvent mixture of CH2Cl2 and 
DMF at 8:2 (v/v). Electrospinning conditions were 
set as reported previously [2]. 
 For cell adhesion and proliferation testing, the 
sample was cut into circles of ca. 15mm radii, 
which were then placed individually into culture 
wells. After the mats were set, PC12 (BCRC: 
60048, Hsinchu, Taiwan) cell-line was seeded on 
the top of membrane and RPMI 1640 medium 
containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% 
fetal bovine serum, and 1% PSN antibiotic mixture 
was added. Culture wells with cover were placed 
in an incubator in a water saturated atmosphere of 
95% air and 5% CO2 for 2, 4, and 8 hours (cell 
adhesion). Cells were then treated with or without 
NGF and further incubated under the same 
condition for 1, 2, 4 days to examine proliferation 
by WST-1 test and to conduct gene expression 
analysis at the end of incubation [3]. 
RESULTS: The diameter of obtained coarse and 
fine electrospun mats is ca. 5000 (coarse) and 500 
(fine) nanometres, respectively. With regards to 
cell proliferation of PC12, it was found that cells 
proliferated more on all PBSA membranes than on 
the TCPS. The PC12 cells cultured on the nano-
fibrous PLLA membrane and TCPS were 
illustrated in Fig.1 (A) and (B), respectively. The 
neurite outgrows was well observed as shown by 
Fig.1 when PC12 were treated with NGF either 
culturing on TCPS or on PLLA fine membrane. 
The results of cell proliferation show that the 
proliferation of PC12 cell was partially inhibited 
after NGF treatment. The gene expressions of 
outgrowth cone (Gap 43), neurite outgrowth (MAP 
2), anti-apoptosis (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) and apoptosis 
(Bax, FAS) are listed in Table 1.

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The cell 
proliferation results indicate that PBSA with more 
amorphous regions promotes cell proliferation in a 
greater extent compared to that for TCPS and 
others samples. This might be due to a favourable 
affinity of PC12 to PBSA. Due to PLLA have a 
higher crystallinity, Gap43 and MAP2 of PC12 
were expressed in a higher extent than that of 
PBSA and TCPS. Furthermore nano-sized (fine) 
mats also induce a higher expression than that of 
micro-sized (coarse) mats. These results indicate 
that an electrospun nano-fibrous PLLA mat is 
more suitable for using as the nerve conduit matrix 
than conventional non/micro-fibrous PLLA or 
PBSA membrane.
