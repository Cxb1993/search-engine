Chapter 2 Kinematics and dynamic analysis 
The toggle mechanism has been already the application of industry far and wide. But 
in the design method of sizes for a toggle mechanism is very lacking in previous papers. 
First, the goal of this paper is that offering a set of practical toggle organization's 
dynamic analysis and multiplies goal optimization to design the procedure. The 
constraint equations of a mechanism can be found based on kinematics. Hamilton 
principle and lagrange multiplier are manipulated to derivate geometry constraint 
equations and dynamic equations. 
2.1 Kinematics analysis 
In the kinematics analysis, from the geometry figure of the mechanism, the constraint 
conditions can be found. The formulation is indicated by independent holomonic 
constraint equation [5] as follows   
( ) ,0=QΦ                                                              (1) 
where [ ]Tnqqqq ,,,, 321 K=Q  is the generalized coordinates of the mechanism system. 
nqqqq ,,,, 321 K  is selected as the independent variables. For one degrees of freedom 
system, if the system has n independent variables, it has n-1 constraint equations. 
Taking the first and second derivatives of the constraint position Eq. (1), the speed and 
acceleration of this constraint equation can be obtained as follows    
0=QΦQ &                                             ( 2 ) 
( ) γQQΦQΦ QQQ ≡−= &&&&                                     ( 3 )     
In the following study, the position, speed and acceleration equations can be found by 
constraint conditions. 
2.1.1 Traditional toggle mechanism 
 The traditional toggle mechanism is shown in Fig. 1. From the figure, it is made up of 
two slider-crank mechanisms. The one is made up of links 1, 2 and slider B, another is 
made up of links 2, 5 and slider C. From the Gruebler’s equation  
( ) 2J,1L3D −−=OF                             (4) 
The toggle mechanism is a one degree of freedom system, where L = 6，J = 7.

If the slider B position can be obtained, the angles 1θ  and 5θ  will be found from Eqs. 
(17) and (19). Therefore, substituting obtained 1θ  and 5θ  into Eq. (21), we can find 
the slider C position. For speed analysis, taking the first and second derivatives of Eq.

Chapter 3 Multiply-object optimal design 
 The requirement of sizes design are less, it can find the desired sizes by analytical 
geometry method. When a lot of design conditions to be suitable, the sizes of 
mechanism are optimal by multiply-object optimal design method. The punch machine 
which is made up of toggle mechanism is designed to match a lot of requirements. 
Therefore, the multiply-object optimal design method must be manipulated to design.  
There are many methods of multiply-object optimal design. The optimal design values 
are that the optimal design values are obtained in some influence conditions. 
The procedure of optimal design for a mechanism is that giving some loads or 
environment conditions. From the responses of the mechanism, size relations and other 
factors, we can select design factors to establish goal function and find optimal sizes. 
3.1 Design stroke 
The punch machine is made up of toggle mechanism is shown in Fig. 2. The 
characteristics of motion and force are all indicated from down constant point to slider 
B, not the angle of links. The reasons are that during the manufacture work element, the 
force of slider B in sC  point whether is suited demand.  
In generalize condition, the manufacture cutting speed is not limited. But to reduce 
noise, vibration and rise the mechanism’s life-span, the manufacture cutting speed must 
be reduced. Therefore, the manufacture range between manufacture point and down 
constant point is selected as design points sC  and FC . The range must be satisfied 
the motion characteristic of manufacture cutting that is shown in Fig. 3.             
3.2 Define objective function 
(1)The lateral force of slider B is hope to small ( 1f ,kg ) 
   The objective function of lateral force of slider B is defined as: 
 ,
tan 2
1 θ
BFf −=  (satisfy range is from sC  to fC ) 
(2)The mechanical efficiency is hope to large ( 2f )  
  The objective function of mechanical efficiency is defined as:  
17
 
Chapter 4 Optimal design 
In this paper, the Taguchi Method is manipulated to design optimal sizes of toggle 
mechanism. The difficult problem is that the objective functions are conflicted with 
constraint conditions mutually. Using the design factors set, it has robustness and 
optimal design procedure. The process of multiply-object optimal design is shown in 
Fig. 4. 
Step 1: define problem 
  The structure and sizes of a punching machine which is made up of toggle 
mechanism is shown in Fig. 2. Its configurations are obtained as follows: 
,6031 mmrr ==  ,322 mmr = mmr 365 = , the stroke ,55mmHd =  the speed of slider 
C sec),/(250 mmvc =  manufacture point mm5 , design point ds HC 05.0=  and 
design point .02.0 df HC =  1f , 2f  and 3f  are the objective functions respectively. 
Step 2: confirmation experiment 
To find different responses of nonlinear effects, three parameters are selected for each 
design factors and the control factors A, B and C are arranged respectively. Considering 
the design factors are not influence each other and the degree of freedom of design 
factors is 8. Therefore, the standard ( )49 3L  orthogonal array is selected and shown in 
Table 1. The S/N ratios of 21, ff  and 3f  are computed that are shown in Table 1. 
The results of S/N1 and S/N3 are hope to small, and S/N2 is hope to large. 
Step 3: Analysis of variance   
One method of analyzing data for process optimization is to use the analysis of variance 
(ANOVA), which is a quick and easy method to analyze results of parameter design. 
The results of ANOVA for the toggle mechanism are shown in Table 2. From Table 2(a), 
it is found that the contribution percent of design factor 3r  is 138 % (optimal size C 
=65mm) and have strong effects on the toggle mechanism. From Table 2(b), it is found 
that the contribution percent of design factor 1r  is 25 % (optimal size A =55mm) and 
also have strong effects on the toggle mechanism. Finally, the ranges of design factors 
are modified and the ranges designs are limited as follows: 
19
 
 Chapter 5 Conclusions 
  This study proposes a systematic analysis method for kinematics including 
Hamilton’s principle and Lagrange multiplier. The dynamic equation of a toggle 
mechanism is derivative to study the dynamic responses. Finally, the optimal design 
procedure of a toggle mechanism is obtained by Taguchi method and design high 
performance sizes of solution sets are found successfully. The optimal solution sets can 
be referred by designer. 
In this paper we present a systematic procedure for identification of the punching 
machine, which is made up by the toggle mechanism driven by a PM synchronous 
servomotor.  The procedure begins a derivation with dynamic formulations that have 
been set up successfully, and give a well description of the motor-toggle mechanism by 
comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulations. Furthermore, the 
recursive least-squares algorithm is employed to estimate its parameters and the 
numerical simulations with identified parameters are compared well with the 
experimental results.
