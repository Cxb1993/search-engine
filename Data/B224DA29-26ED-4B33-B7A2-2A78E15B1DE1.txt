2formation of native oxide and degradation of
electrical properties. To optimize device
behaviors and achieve thermal stability, the
sulfur passivation has been developed to be a
promising technique [5-7].
Previously, the sulfur passivation effects
on the temperature-dependent characteristics of
HEMTs with Pt/Au gate Schottky contact were
demonstrated in our report [7]. However, the Pt
metal is easy to chemically react with GaAs or
AlGaAs layer at the relatively low temperature
[8]. Thus, it is difficult to control the accuracy
and precision of sulfur passivation on the
device with Pt/Au gate alloy. Also, the sulfur
passivation effect could be degraded quickly
when the device was exposed to ambient
atmosphere [9]. This certainly leads to
reliability problems for device performance.
Therefore, deposition of an oxygen-free
dielectric layer after sulfur passivation is
necessary to protect the sulfide layer and
achieve long-term stable passivation. Above all,
silicon nitride (SiNx) is one of the dominant
materials for further stabilizing the sulfur
passivation effect [10-11].
In this work, a formal passivation method,
that combines the sulfur and SiNx passivations,
is employed to achieve improved operation
stability and reliable device performance in
HEMTs with Ti/Pt/Au gate Schottky contact.
To meet the desired accuracy, the Ti metal as a
part of gate Schottky contact is employed [12].
This improved experimental condition would
be useful to study the inherent effect of sulfur
and SiNx passivations without any
unpredictable effects. Moreover, the proposed
passivation technique is substantially different
from previous work [7]. For the formal
passivation, an additional SiNx passivation
layer is deposited on the mesa sidewall and the
exposed sulfur-passivated barrier surface
between drain-source and gate edge. The
effects of sulfur and SiNx passivations in the
electric parameters are analyzed and
comprehensive studied. The comparisons
between the formal-passivated device and
non-passivated device are made to show the
effect of formal passivation on device
performance. Furthermore, in order to
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
formal passivation over standard sulfur
passivation, the sulfur-passivated device is also
included in the reliability test.
四、研究方法
The studied device was grown on a
(100)-oriented semi-insulating (S.I.) GaAs
substrate by a metal-organic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) system. The epitaxial
structure consisted of buffer, active, barrier, and
cap layers. The conventional HEMT structure
with an n-Al0.25Ga0.75As (n=3×1017 cm-3)
barrier layer is similar to the previous work.7
The Hall measurement showed the electron
mobility (n) of 6342 cm2/V-s and sheet carrier
density (ns) of 2.51×1012 cm-2 at 300K. The
upper barrier layer provides good Schottky
characteristics and lower buffer layer
suppresses the substrate leakage current
through the substrate leakage path. After
epitaxial growth, the mesa isolation was
performed by wet chemical etching process.
Drain-source Ohmic contacts were formed on
the top of cap layer by rapid thermal annealing
of AuGe/Ni/Au metallurgy. Then, the cap layer
was removed. The detailed formal passivation
process is expressed as follows. First,
photo-resist was patterned to define the
exposed drain-source region. Prior to gate
metal deposition, the sample was immediately
passivated by soaking in the ammonia-sulfide
((NH4)2Sx, 5%) solution for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Subsequently, the sample was
rinsed in acetone and deionized (DI) water,
followed by blown dry N2 gas. Although the
S-III bonds were formed on the AlGaAs surface,
the differently thin whitish amorphous sulfur
and/or sulfates were found on the drain and
source electrodes [13]. However, by using this
particular procedure, it could prepare the clean
surfaces of AlGaAs barrier layer and Ohmic
4Schottky contact plays a key role in device
performance [7]. The higher B of device A
indicates that the lower interface traps at the
formal-passivated metal/AlGaAs Schottky
contact are obtained. This proves that the
undesired Fermi level pinning effect is
substantially suppressed and the dependence of
Schottky barrier height on metal work function
is indeed enhanced. Furthermore, for device A,
the relatively temperature-insensitive
characteristics of B are observed. Since the
thermally stable Al-S bonds and SiNx layer are
formed on the AlGaAs surface, they effectively
prevent the adsorption of oxygen and then
suppress the surface leakage current [10-11, 14,
16]. Therefore, the formal-passivated device
shows improved gate Schottky and breakdown
characteristics as indicated in Fig. 2. The
typical output current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics of devices A and B at different
temperatures are shown in Fig. 3. The applied
gate-source voltage is VGS = -0.5V/step.
Clearly, both the studied devices exhibit good
saturation characteristics and pinch-off
properties over wide temperature range (300 ~
480K). This is because of the specifically
designed structure which leads to the low gate
leakage current associated with good Schottky
behaviors and carrier confinement effect. Also,
under the bias condition of VGS = +0.0 V, the
available drain-source saturation current (IDSS =
312 mA/mm) of device A is lower than that
(318 mA/mm) of device B at 300K. This is
caused by the substantial increase of gate
depletion region and potential energy, V,
resulted from the enhanced B of the
formal-passivated metal/AlGaAs Schottky
contact [14]. Thus, the current variation and
corresponding change in I-V characteristics are
obtained for device A.
The threshold voltage (Vth) as a function
of temperature is shown in Fig. 4. The biased
voltage is fixed at VDS = 3.5 V. The inset shows
the distribution of temperature variation rate in
Vth, i.e., ∂Vth/∂T, for devices A and B. The Vth
is determined from the intercept point by the
extrapolation of (IDS)1/2 versus VGS curve. To
obtain the required accuracy and validity, a
statistical analysis concerning about the
variation of process uniformity is performed.
There are more than 15 samples in five times
process (process by process, device by device)
used in this work. Due to the slightly standard
deviation of ∂Vth/∂Tin different samples, the
moderate device characteristics are chosen for
obtaining the reliable results. Along with the
experimental data, the Vth values of devices A,
B, and C are decreased from -1.67, -1.83, and
-1.64 to -1.76, -1.94, and -1.72 V as the
temperature is increased from 300 to 480K.
Upon the sulfur passivation, the lower density
of interface traps presented between the
drain-source and the gate edge would result in
the increased B [14]. Hence, for devices A
and C, the enhanced gate control ability and
related lower Vth magnitudes are found. In
particular, the Vth of device A is slightly
degraded than that of device C. This is resulted
from the hot carriers trapping in SiNx/AlGaAs
interface which leads to the additional leakage
current and a negative shift of the Vth [10-11].
Moreover, it is known that the device thermal
stability is influenced by gate Schottky
performance [4, 7]. Due to the excellent
Schottky behaviors associated with high BVGD
and B, the ∂Vth/∂T, from 300 to 480K, of
devices A and C are -0.46 and -0.428 mV/K,
which are significantly better than that of
device B (-0.601 mV/K). This is certainly
suitable for high-temperature applications. On
the other hand, as compared with the device C,
the slightly degraded temperature coefficient of
device A is observed. This proves again that the
lower thermal conductivity of SiNx layer may
increase the device operating temperature and
lead to the relatively poorer rectifying
performance of gate Schottky contact.
Accordingly, the relatively higher |VGS| is
needed to deplete the channel and then the Vth
is little degenerated with the increase of
temperature. Based on these results, it is known
that the deviations of electrical properties and
6reliability performance of device C is often
impeded by chemical instability of thinner
sulfide layer against ambient atmosphere [9,
19]. When the moisture or oxygen penetrates
into the underlying AlGaAs surface, this results
in the formation of native oxide and related
G-R leakage currents. Thus, for device C, the
enhanced sulfur-passivated AlGaAs surface
eventually deteriorates back to its initial state.
However, the reliability performance of device
A is improved by employing an additional SiNx
coating after sulfur passivation. It is because
that both the sulfur and SiNx passivations could
mitigate the interface traps, protect the sulfide
layer, and stabilize the surface improvement
[10-11, 14]. Therefore, the formal-passivated
device exhibits relatively long-term electrical
characteristics.
The microwave characteristics of device A
at 300K are depicted in Fig. 8. The inset shows
unity current gain cut-off frequency (fT) and
maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) versus
drain saturation current (IDS) of devices A and
B. The biased voltage is fixed at VDS = 3.5 V.
For device A, the maximum fT and fmax are 21.2
and 73.3 GHz at 300K. The corresponding
maximum fT and fmax of device B are 19.2 and
67.1 GHz. Moreover, the studied devices A and
B maintain 90 % of its fT (fmax) peak values
over large IDS operating regimes of 262 and 234
mA/mm at 300K, respectively. Obviously, the
device A exhibits better characteristics in fT,
fmax, and IDS operating regime. Since the formal
passivation allows the fabrication of
high-quality metal/AlGaAs Schottky contact
with low density of interface traps, this
certainly reduce the channel output
conductance and parasitic capacitance [7, 20].
Consequently, the formal-passivated device
with high frequency operating capability and
good linearity in microwave performance are
obtained.
六、結論
The temperature-dependent characteristics
of HEMTs with sulfur and SiNx passivations
are studied and demonstrated. Experimentally,
the formal-passivated device exhibits the
considerably enhanced device characterisitcs
than non-passivated device including higher
gate-drain breakdown voltage (39.3 V), higher
Schottky barrier height (0.993 eV), lower
threshold voltage (-1.67 V), higher maximum
transconductance (236 mS/mm), and lower
output conductance (0.49 mS/mm) at 300K.
The improved temperature coefficients on
BVGD (-1.66×10-3 /K), B (-3.23×10-4 /K), Vth
(-0.46 mV/K), gm,max (-6.46×10-4 /K), and gds
(3.31×10-4 /K) are also observed as the
temperature is increased from 300 to 480K.
Besides, it is found that the studied device with
formal passivations shows the comparable
electrical properties and temperature
coefficients to the device only with sulfur
passivation. However, in contrast to the
sulfur-passivated device, the degradations of
reliability performance on IDS (2.9 %) and Vth
(2.6 %) are insignificant as the accelerated
stress time increases up to 429 hr. Therefore,
the studied device provides the promise for
high-performance and high-reliability
electronic applications.

二、英文摘要 
Comprehensive and systematical 
comparisons of temperature-dependent 
characteristics of In0.42Al0.58As/In0.46Ga0.54As 
metamorphic heterostructure field-effect 
transistors (MHFETs) with various Schottky 
gate alloys are studied and demonstrated. The 
influence of Schottky barrier height on the 
impact ionization effect and its associated 
device performance are also investigated. 
Better DC and microwave characteristics can 
be obtained by using the higher metal work 
function of gate alloys, e.g., Ti/Au, Ni/Au, and 
Pt/Au. In particular, the device with Pt/Au gate 
alloy shows the superior device performance in 
breakdown voltage, threshold voltage, 
maximum transconductance, output 
conductance, voltage gain, and microwave 
properties at room temperature. Furthermore, 
the device with Ti/Au gate alloy shows the 
thermally stable performance in threshold 
voltage, maximum transconductance, output 
conductance, and voltage gain over wide 
operating temperature range (from 300 to 
510K). Consequently, the studied devices with 
appropriate Schottky gate contacts provide the 
promise for high-speed and high-temperature 
electronic applications. 
 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
Recently, the metamorphic heterostructure 
field-effect transistor (MHFET) or 
metamorphic high electron mobility transistor 
(MHEMT) has been demonstrated to have 
excellent high frequency device performance 
 12
300Å In0.42Al0.58As Schottky barrier layer. For 
comparison, the devices using Ti/Au (device A), 
Au (device B), Pt/Au (device C), and Ni/Au 
(device D) as Schottky gate metal are also 
fabricated by using the same process sequence 
except for Schottky gate metal. Finally, the 
active structure underneath the gate feeder is 
completely removed by wet chemical etching 
to build the air-bridge gate structure which 
includes multiple piers under the gate-feeder 
metal [10]. The gate dimension is 1×100 μm2. 
The experimental DC current-voltage (I-V) 
characteristics are measured by an HP4156A 
semiconductor parameter analyzer at different 
temperature (from 300 to 510K). The 
microwave performance of the studied device 
is measured by an HP8510C vector network 
analyzer in conjunction with Cascade probes 
over the frequency ranged from 0.5 GHz to 20 
GHz at room temperature. The complete 
experiment was repeated more than 15 samples 
in five times process (process by process, 
device by device), giving typical and reliable 
results to confirm reproducibility of the device 
characteristics reported here. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
The forward turn-on voltage Von and 
gate-drain breakdown voltage BVGD as a 
function of temperature are shown in Fig. 2. 
The Von and BVGD are measured under the gate 
current of 1 and -0.5 mA/mm. The BVGD 
values of devices A, B, C, D are 19.7, 19.3, 
21.9, 19.9 and 12.6, 10.2, 14.6, 10.8 V at 300 
and 510K, respectively. The corresponding Von 
values are 1.08, 1.03, 1.18, 1.11 and 0.62, 0.49, 
0.63, 0.56 V, respectively. The Von indicates 
the upper limit of the applied forward gate bias 
before the gate leakage current increases 
significantly. Obviously, for devices A, C, and 
D, the relatively higher values of Von allow 
larger induced currents in the channel under the 
applied forward gate biases. This can cause the 
enhancement of output power capability. 
Moreover, the related temperature coefficients 
in Von (BVGD), i.e., ∂Von/Von·1/∂T 
(∂BVGD/BVGD·1/∂T), from 300 to 510K, are 
-2.02×10-3 (-1.73×10-3), -2.55×10-3 (-2.31×10-3), 
-2.25×10-3 (-1.51×10-3), and -2.35×10-3 K-1 
(-2.20×10-3 K-1), respectively. Due to the 
reduced energy gap, accumulated tunneling 
current, and impact ionization effect, the Von 
and BVGD are decreased with increasing the 
temperature. However, it is found that the 
temperature coefficients in Von and BVGD are 
improved by using the higher metal work 
function of gate alloys. Therefore, within the 
temperature range of 300 ~ 510K, the 
thermal-stable Schottky characteristics of 
devices with Ti/Au (device A), Pt/Au (device 
C), and Ni/Au (device D) gate alloys better 
than the device with Au (device B) gate metal 
is achieved. 
In addition, in order to avoid the series 
resistance effect created by the InAlAs barrier 
layer, the modified Norde method is used [11]. 
Based on the thermionic emission and Norde 
models, the conducting current of a gate-drain 
Schottky diode and Norde function F(V,γ) can 
be obtained as [11]:

where A is the Schottky contact area, A* the 
effective Richardson constant, T the absolute 
temperature, ΦB the Schottky barrier height, k 
the Boltzmann’s constant, R the series 
resistance, n the ideality factor, and γ the 
arbitrary constant greater than n. Once the γ 
values and minimum value of the F(V,γ) plot 
are determined, the ΦB and n can be obtained. 
According to Eqs. (1) and (2), the calculated 
ΦB and n as a function of temperature are 
illustrated in Fig. 3. Even operating under 
higher temperature of 510K, the improved ΦB 
and n are obtained for devices A (0.71 eV and 
1.22), C (0.82 eV and 1.23), and D (0.65 eV 
and 1.24), which are significantly better than 
those of device B (0.63 eV and 1.24). The 
 14
more rapidly with the increase of temperature. 
On the contrary, due to the thermal stability of 
Ti/Au gate alloy [18], the device A shows 
lower degradation rates in Vth (∂Vth/∂T = -0.25 
mV/K) and gm,max (∂gm,max/∂T = -0.069 
mS/mm·K) among the temperature of 300 ~ 
510K. This implies that the refractory metal of 
Ti is effective in preventing the Au metal 
diffusing into the active structure and 
eliminating the leakage current formation. 
To well understand the influence of impact 
ionization, the gate current IG versus 
gate-source voltage VGS at 300K is shown in 
Fig. 6. The biased voltage is fixed at VDS = 2.0 
V. The typical “bell-shaped” behavior observed 
at varied gate alloys is a clear evidence of 
impact ionization in the InGaAs channel [7, 19]. 
The detailed interpretations concerning about 
this behavior are explained as follows. Because 
of the present of high electric field in gate-drain 
region at high VDS voltage, electrons may 
acquire enough energy to induce the 
hot-electron phenomena in the InGaAs channel. 
Subsequently, the impact ionization and related 
electron-hole pairs generation occur to lead to 
the increase of gate leakage current [20]. 
However, for devices A, C, and D, the 
bell-shape behavior is relatively suppressed as 
compared with that of device B. For instance, 
the peak gate current IG,max of devices A, C, and 
D (-0.47, -0.41, and -0.51 μA/mm) are lower 
than that of device B (-0.74 μA/mm). This is 
caused by the evaporated higher metal work 
function of gate alloys resulting in the increase 
of Schottky barrier height. This may 
significantly extend the depletion region 
beneath the gate, which results in the decrease 
of drain current in the channel. Therefore, the 
impact ionization effect can be effectively 
suppressed. Especially, it is also found that the 
IG,max of devices A, C, and D shift toward more 
positive VGS regimes. It is because that since 
the IG,max is dominant by the drain current 
density, the VGS must increase to maintain the 
same drain current density. Figure 7 represents 
the temperature dependences of output 
conductance gds and voltage gain AV. The 
biased voltages are fixed at VDS = 2.0 V and 
VGS = -0.8 V. Clearly, due to the suppression of 
impact ionization effect, the lower gds and 
higher AV values are observed for device C 
(0.82 mS/mm and 307) at 300K. This result 
indicates that the studied device with higher 
Schottky barrier height of gate contact really 
shows the better amplification performance. 
Besides, the temperature degradation rates in 
gds (∂gds/∂T) and AV (∂AV/∂T) of devices A, B, 
C, D are 1.23, 20.2, 15.1, 19.7 μS/mm·K and 
-0.33, -0.46, -1.09, -0.69 K-1, respectively. By 
using the refractory metal of Ti, the 
degradation of device A, such as gds and AV, 
with increasing temperature is insignificant. 
Therefore, the studied device with Ti/Au gate 
alloy provides the substantial advantage for 
high-temperature electronic applications. 
The microwave characteristics of the 
studied devices at 300K are shown in Fig. 8. 
The biased voltage is fixed at VDS = 2.0 V. The 
unity current gain cut-off frequency fT 
(maximum oscillation frequency fmax) of 
devices A, B, C, and D are 18.4 (56.2), 17.5 
(42.2), 22.5 (70.8), 18.4 (61.7) GHz, 
respectively. For fT and fmax, they can be 
computed as [14]:

where CP is the parasitic capacitance, Ci 
the intrinsic capacitance, and Ri the series 
resistance. Through using the identical epitaxial 
structure, the similar Ri values are observed for 
all studied devices. Thus, according to Eq. (5), 
the fmax is nearly in proportion to fT/(gds)1/2. The 
calculated fT/(gds)1/2 values of devices A, B, C, 
and D are 18.2, 12.6, 24.9, and 15.9 
GHz/(mS/mm)1/2, respectively. Apparently, due 
to the improved impact ionization effect and 
amplification performance, the fT and fmax 
(fT/(gds)1/2) values of device C are higher than
