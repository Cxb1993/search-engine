英文摘要 
In this study, we propose an X-architecture 
routing algorithm for a clock network. With the 
definition of 16-pattern X-routing for a pair of points, 
our algorithm applies these patterns to simplify the 
selection of merging segments whereas using the 
DME approach and constructs an X-clock tree with 
zero skew. An X-flip is employed to shorten the 
wire length of each pair of points as possible for 
minimal clock delay. Moreover, a wire sizing is 
applied to remove snaking wires for saving routing 
resource. Experimental results on benchmarks 
compared with other algorithms show that our 
improvements in terms of clock delay, wire length, 
power consumption, and via cost are 16%, 0.8%, 
1.5%, and 17.4%, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In synchronous VLSI design, clock routing 
dominates chip performance. Wire delay has a 
first-order effect on clock routing performance due 
to wire lengths increase rapidly with the shrinking 
geometry in nanometer scales [1]. Minimal clock 
delay and zero skew are two major requirements 
for a clock routing. Many techniques were 
proposed to treat them carefully. The MMM 
(method of means and medians) algorithm [2] 
generates a topology by recursively partitioning a 
set of sinks into two equal-sized subsets 
downwardly and then connects a centre of mass of 
entire set to centers of mass of two subsets 
upwardly. The GMA (geometric matching algorithm) 
algorithm [3] geometrically matches a set of sinks 
and contributes 5-7% less total wire length than 
MMM. 
Tsay [4] achieved an exact zero skew tree 
(ZST). The approach recursively combines pairs of 
sub-ZSTs at a tapping point to create an upward 
ZST. The location of the tapping point is 
determined to achieve zero skew with a condition 
ratio x. If 0≤x≤1, the tapping point is located on a 
point along the wiring path between two subtrees. If 
x< 0 or x>1, the tapping point is exactly on the root 
of one of them and a snaking wire is required for 
balancing clock skew. The DME (deferred merge 
embedding) algorithm [5] was another popular 
method in clock routing field. It generates a ZST 
and gets 8-15% wire length reduction over MMM 
and GMA. However, all above approaches base on 
Manhattan architecture and only deal with 
horizontal and vertical wires, such as metal layers 1 
and 2 (M1 and M2), on routing space. 
Current manufacturing technologies [6] have 
the sufficient lithographic considerations and 
support routing wires with arbitrary angles, 
especially for diagonal wires (±45°) using extra 
metal layers 3 and 4 (M3 and M4). Basically, 
decreasing the wire length can reduce the wire 
delay. The X-architecture [7] wire topology is 
defined as the combination of diagonal, horizontal, 
and vertical wires and contributes improvements of 
10%, 20%, 30%, and 20% in terms of chip 
performance, power consumption, die cost, and 
wire length, respectively. 
Figure 1 shows the potential of saving wire 
length based on X-architecture. A dotted wire 
connecting two points, s1 and s2, has an arbitrary 
angle α with x-axis and its Euclidean distance is L = 
[(x1-x2)2+(y1-y2)2]1/2. The wire connecting two points 
based on Manhattan architecture with length 
LM=L(sinα+cosα) is shown in Fig. 1(a). In general, 
LM=4L/π ≈ 1.27L on average. Figure 1(b) shows a 
wire based on X-architecture and its wire length is 
LX=L(0.41sinα+cosα). Basically, LX ≈ 1.055L on 
average. Obviously, the X-architecture contributes 
the shorter wire length than that of the Manhattan 
architecture.

Due to the ED model has the overestimated 
delay, this model causes limited accuracy in wire 
delay. Alternately, the Fitted Elmore delay (FED) 
model [11] is more efficient and accurate than the 
ED model. The wire delay based on the FED model 
with a load capacitance CL at sink i is denoted as [ ]iLifiaiiiiL FClEcwDcwlr ), w, l(C  ,)(5.0)/(FED ++=  (1) 
where the coefficients D, E, and F are obtained by 
a curve fitting technique that approximates HSPICE

IV. PATTERN-MATCHING-BASED X-CLOCK 
ROUTING ALGORITHM 
Given a set of sinks S = {s1, s2, …, sn}, we 
apply DME approach associated with a set of 
16-kind of X-patterns for a pair of points to 
construct a ZST with minimal clock delay, wire 
length, and via cost. Our algorithm called 
pattern-matching X-clock routing (PMX) will be 
described in the following subsections. 
 
A. Determine Pair of Points in GMA (DPPG) 
Since GMA is a bottom-up geometric matching 
algorithm for the clock tree construction, it can find 
the pair of points which has the shortest distance 
from the start point to other end points. The GMA 
focuses primarily on path-length balancing and 
addresses on clock skew minimization. Thus, we 
firstly use GMA to determine pair of points for 
minimum total wire length. 
 
B. Choose Proper X-Pattern (CPXP) 
To apply our defined X-patterns for a pair of 
points determined by DPPG introduced in IV.A, the 
routing area is firstly tiled into four zones, LT, RT, 
LB, and RB. Then the zone location for each sink 
or point can be determined through its coordinate. 
With the given set of 16-kind of X-patterns for a pair 
of two points referred in Table I, we can choose the 
proper X-pattern wires for this pair of points, called 
the technique of CPXP. 
For a pair of points, s1 and s2, shown in Fig. 5, 
the start point, s1, locates on LT of routing area and 
the end point, s2, locates on SRT of s1, their 
X-pattern wire will be PTN_1 denoted as 
CPXP(s1,s2) = PTN_1. Then we exchange their 
roles to get the other proper X-pattern. The start 
point, s2, locates on RT of routing area and the end 
point, s1, locates on SLB of s2, and its X-pattern will 
be PTN_1 or PTN_2 depending the random one, 
i.e., CPXP(s1,s2) = PTN_R. Finally, the X-pattern 
for the pair of points is determined by the 
intersection between CPXP(s1,s2) and CPXP(s2,s1). 
Figure 5 illustrates the proper X-patterns for the 
clock tree which contains 8 sinks, such as, 
CPXP(X1,X2) ∩ CPXP(X2,X1)= PTN_1 ∩ PTN_R 
= PTN_1 and CPXP(X4,X6) ∩ CPXP(X6,X4) = 
PTN_R ∩ PTN_2 = PTN_2. If CPXP(Xn, Xn+1) ∩ 
CPXP(Xn+1, Xn) = PTN_1 ∩ PTN_2, we have to 
assign PTN_R to their intersection.

C. Determine Coordinate of Tapping Point 
(DCTP) 
The determination of a tapping point Pt for a 
pair of points is a key part in a ZST construction. 
Figure 6(a) shows the X-pattern of a pair of points, 
the bending point PB is on the bend of wires where 
two edge vias should be inserted. Figure 6(b) is the 
equivalent FED model of Fig. 6(a) for determining 
the coordinate of tapping point Pt. The roots of 
subtree1 and subtree2 are denoted as s1 and s2, 
respectively. The wire delay is defined as from Pt to 
a root node. We can use binary search [12] to 
determine the zero skew condition, x, and force two 
wire delays based on X-architecture, dx(s1, Pt) and 
dx(s2, Pt), to be equal. For 0≤x≤1, we can get Pt 
that it locates the connecting wire between two 
subtrees with zero skew. But, for x<0 or x>1, an 
extra snaking wire is added to balance wire delays.

D. Wire Sizing 
Adding snaking wires is the normal method for 
zero skew during a clock tree construction. Here, 
we may size the wires where are attached by 
snaking wires to remove the snaking wires and 
improve clock delay. It is noted in [13], wire sizing 
can release the routing resources occupied by 
snaking wires, but it may cause extra power 
consumption due to the wider wires. We should 
treat them carefully. 
For simplicity, we discuss only the case that 
x<0, i.e., the zero skew condition of x is smaller 
than zero. It means that the clock skew is a 
negative value and dx(s1, Pt) is larger than dx(s2, Pt) 
as shown in Fig. 6(b). A widen wire can 
compensate the clock skew to satisfy the zero 
 5
the same delay model. As shown in Table IV, the 
PMXF performs efficiently on via minimization in 
terms of edge via, EV, and node via, NV, than that 
of the NVM. The total via cost is reduced up to 
17.4% on average. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
X-architecture has been proven more 
effective in terms of wire length and clock delay 
than Manhattan architecture. With the above 
experimental results, we observe that the DME-4[8] 
adopts the balanced bipartition in pair-up 
procedure to reduce the wire length and 
capacitance variation of merging segments as 
possible. Moreover, our proposed algorithm 
employs the pattern-matching-based method 
associated with X-flip in pair-up procedure to 
minimize the delay and wire length and thus 
performs well in clock delay, power, and via cost. 
In the extended works, we will integrate the 
considerations of buffer insertion, crosstalk 
reduction, and DFM (design for manufacture) with 
the nanometer process into our PMXF.
