I摘要
在接單式的生產系統中，由於生產計劃是隨客戶訂單之接單與否以進行產能規劃，亦
即每筆訂單之決策結果將影響產能需求及後續訂單之接單能力，因此每筆訂單接受或拒絕
之決策將影響整體獲利能力。在產能有限的情形下，最簡單的決策方式係採用先到先服務
法 (first come first service, FCFS)，但卻可能因先接受低獲利之訂單而喪失未來接受高獲利
訂單之能力。因此我們需適當地拒絕低獲利之訂單以保留產能給未來高獲利之訂單。這是
一種產能配給 (capacity rationing)的作法。由於未來需求狀況為不確定，本研究假設未來的
訂單到達為卜瓦松過程(Poisson process)且未來每筆訂單之產能使用量與單位產能獲利為
隨機變數。當一筆已知獲利及產能需求的查詢訂單到達時，配合目前已知的剩餘產能，本
研究建立決策模型去決定是否接受該筆訂單。此方法於每筆查詢訂單到達時決定未來訂單
獲利將高於目前查詢訂單之機率，以此機率決定未來獲利高於本查詢訂單之訂單的卜瓦松
過程，藉此可計算出未來所有獲利高於本查詢訂單的產能需求之機率分配。配合現有產能
及本筆查詢訂單產能使用量以判斷該查詢訂單應該接受或拒絕。我們將用電腦模擬驗證本
決策方式之成效，並與其他相關文獻所提出之訂單決策方法比較。在不同的問題假設下，
本研究可分成六個子問題。我們將分三年完成這六個子問題的解決方法。

11. Introduction
Demand management or yield management is essential for maximizing profit in both the
manufacturing and service industries. When expected demands are more than available capacity,
a manufacturer should select the more profitable orders and reject the less profitable orders in
order to better allocate its limited capacity and maximize its profit. However, the orders will
arrive at different times in the future, so the manufacturer cannot look at all the order inquiries at
the same time and select the most profitable ones. When an order inquiry arrives, the
manufacturer does not know exactly what future orders will be and when they will arrive. Facing
such an uncertain future, the manufacturer should respond within a short time as to whether it
can accept or reject the current order inquiry. This is a so-called capacity rationing problem or
order selection problem.
The simplest approach to such a problem is to apply the first-come-first-served rule (briefly,
FCFS). This approach is easy to implement and almost used by every companies. This is not a
good way to allocate the limited capacity effectively in terms of maximizing profits if the
expected future demands exceed the available capacity.
Therefore, a make-to-order manufacturer must establish demand management policies to
resolve short-term capacity allocation problems when its expected demands exceed capacity.
Thus, the focus of this study is to build decision tools to help managers make correct
accept-or-reject decisions on order inquiries based on known information, which includes the
deterministic parameters of current available capacity and the order inquiry as well as the
stochastic parameters of future order arrivals.
The capacity rationing problem has long received considerable attention in service
industries. The approaches to optimize the revenue of firms are called yield management or
revenue management. By reviewing the literature about yield management, Kimes (1989)
structures its concepts, classifies its solution approaches, and discusses its managerial
implications. The work on the airline industry can be found in (Pfeifer, 1989; Smith et al., 1992;
Brumelle and Mcgill, 1993); on hotel management in (Relihan, 1989; Norman and Mayer, 1997;
Badinelli, 2000; Emeksiz et al., 2006), on car rental agencies in (Carrol and Ggrimes, 1995), and
on golf course management in (Kimes, 2000).
In the manufacturing sector, the production environment can be classified into two types:
make-to-stock and make-to-order. In a make-to-stock firm, since the inventories of items are a
limited resource, the concept and approaches for rationing inventories are necessary. Some of
these are discussed in (Kaplan, 1969; Nahmias and Demmy, 1981; Haynsworth and Price, 1989;
Rinks, 1989; and Ha, 1997). For make-to-order firms, the limited resource is the capacity. While
a make-to-stock firm needs to reserve or ration the actual product inventory, a make-to-order
firm does the same with manufacturing capacity.
Balakrishnan et al. (1996), Patterson et al. (1997), and Balakrishnan et al.(1999) deal with
the problem of rationing the capacity of a single period by discriminating between two profit
classes of orders. Balakrishnan et al. (1996) first develop such a capacity rationing decision
method that calculate the amount of capacity reserved for future orders of higher profit products
when an order inquiry arrives. They demonstrate that their method can increase profits for a

an order. If q > c , we have to reject the order. If cq and z , the order is accepted;
otherwise, the order is rejected.
2.2. Dynamic stochastic capacity rationing decision procedure (DSCR)
This dynamic decision procedure is more complex than SPCR and is outlined below.
Step 1: If q>c, reject this inquire order and stop the decision procedure.
Step 2: Compute z}P{Z  .
Step 3: The distribution of the random variable of the high profitable orders is a Poisson
distribution with arrival rate t)-(T .

profitable orders that arrive within interval  Tt, and whose profit per unit capacity is higher

Step6: If ar PP  , we reject the order inquiry. Conversely, if ra PP  , we accept the order
inquiry.
2.3. Decision with perfect information
Suppose we know the information of all the future orders at the start of planning horizon or
we are allowed to delay our responses to all the order inquires until the end of planning horizon.
Under such conditions, we can solve the problem as a deterministic knapsack optimization
problem and its solution is the optimal decisions with perfect information (or briefly, DWPI).
3. Computer simulation experiments and analysis
Four decision procedures are discussed above: the first-come-first-served (FCFS) decision
rule, the SPCR decision procedure, and the DSCR decision procedure, and the decision with
perfect information (DWPI). Hence, there are four methods used to solve each random problem.
Each approach uses one of the four decision procedures discussed above.
The following constant parameters are used to generate random problems. The end time of
the order arrival process is 10 (T ). The initial available capacity at the start of the order arrival
process is 10000 ( 0C ). The capacity requirement of an order is normal distribution with mean

We can clearly see that the performance of all three approaches do not change much, as the
standard deviation of capacity requirement ( q ) varies.
