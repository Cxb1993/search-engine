Since the past 30 years, researchers have constructed various mathematical models for illustrating and 
predicting the wafer yield. Most of the models were based on the same assumption that the number of 
particles of contamination on a wafer follows a Poisson distribution. The defect distribution was 
characterized as a function of device size and complexity. The resulting prediction is poor due to the fact 
that defect densities are subject to spatial and temporal variations.  
 
Taam et al. (1993) proposed a log odd ratio to detect spatial effects in the integrated circuit manufacturing 
process. By using a measure of spatial dependence, process factors that influence the spatial clustering of 
function or nonfunctional chips can be identified. Hansen et al. (1997) suggested that wafer yields were 
the adequate measure if the defective ICs were distributed randomly both within and across wafers in a lot. 
However, the defects often occur in clusters or in some systematic patterns in practice. In general, the 
cause of the spatially clustered defects can be traced to individual machines or to a series of process that 
did not meet the specified requirements. Friedman et al. (1997) used binary probe test data at the wafer 
level to estimate the size, shape and location of large-area defects or clusters of defective chips. His 
approach made an extensive use of the location of failing chips to identify clusters directly. By estimating 
the spatial signature of clustered defects directly, process engineers can associate the process control to the 
root-cause analysis. Chen et al. (2000) employed neural-network architecture named adaptive resonance 
theory network 1 (ART 1) to detect the spatial defect patterns on the wafer. They also linked the result as a 
clue for the identification of the variation of equipment and process. They also showed that their approach 
could correctly and effectively recognize the similar defects. Skinner et al. (2002) compared various 
statistical methods of using probe test data to determine the cause of low yield wafers. Their test included 
two traditional multivariate methods. The first one was the clustering and principal components method. 
The second one was the regression-based method. The results from both methods were then compared to 
the result from the classification and regression tree (CART) method. The traditional multivariate methods 
were proved to be useless to the probe test data. They strongly recommended CART as an exploratory and 
analysis technique for the wafer probe data since CART is distribution-free procedure. Palma et al. (2005) 
compared two unsupervised neural network classifier, SOM and ART1, for the validation and recognition 
of the spatial pattern on the wafer. They concluded that ART1 was not adequate, whereas SOM provided 
completely satisfactory results including visually effective representation of spatial probability of the 
pattern classes.                      
 
3.Methodology 
The proposed approach is an intelligent system capable of recognizing spatial patterns of clustered defects 
by integrating spatial statistics, co-occurrence matrix, moment invariants, SOM and SVM for WBM 
pattern classification. In the following paragraphs, we briefly illustrate the methods employed in this 
hybrid approach. 
 
3.1A Measure of Spatial Clustering 
We employed log odds ratio Eq. (3.1) as a measure of spatial clustering. This spatial measure was proved 
to be effective to identify the spatial effects that influenced the spatial clustering of functional or 
nonfunctional chips on the wafer bin map. WBM data is binary, for instance, 1 indicated a good die and 0 
a bad chip. Thus, the dependence among chips can be measured by join-count statistics. Three spatial 
dependence are given as follows: J(GG) = the number of joins among king-move neighbors that connect 
two good chips on a wafer; J(GB) = the number of joins among king-move neighbors that connect a good 
and a bad chip on a wafer; J(BB) = the number of joins among king-move neighbors that connect two bad 
chips on a wafer. The log odds ratio quantifies spatial dependence and independence through the 3×3 or 
5×5 mask calculation for smoothing the spatial effects. A positive value indicates an attraction of like 
outcomes whereas a negative value indicates a repulsion of them. A value near 0 represents the 
independence (random effect). Thus, the sign of θ indicates the type of spatial dependence (attraction or 
repulsion) as well as its magnitude measures the degree of dependence. After separating the systematic 
pattern of bad chips, the feature such as co-occurrence matrix and moment invariants are extracted.

The SVM obtains high generalization performance without the need to add a priori knowledge even when 
the dimension of the input space is high. This fits well within the framework of this proposal. In this 
section we provide a methodology for selecting SVM model well fitted to the number of transferred 
patters (i.e., model order selection). Some notation and key concepts should be defined first. 
 
3.3.1 Optimal Separating Hyperplane 
Let  be a training example set S, each example  belongs to a class labeled 
by . The goal is to define a hyperplane which divides S such that all the points with the same 
label are on the same side of the hyperplane while maximizing the distance between the two classes. This 
means to find a pair (w, b) such that

Niby ii ,...,1,0)( =>+⋅        xw                              (3.11) 
where  and . The pair (w, b) defines a separating hyperplane  nR∈w Rb∈
                        .                                          (3.12) 0=+⋅ bxw
If there exists a hyperplane satisfying the criteria, set S is said to be linearly separable and we can change 
w and b so that 
Niby ii ,...,1.1)( =≥+⋅        xw                           (3.13) 
Accordingly, we know that the minimal distance between the closest point and the hyperplane is w1 . 
Among all hyperplanes, we assume OSH is a hyperplane whose distance to the closest point is maximal. 
In order to find OSH we minimize 
2w  under the constraint of Eq. (3.13) instead of maximizing w1 .  
Since 
2w  is convex, we can minimize it under the constraint of Eq. (3.13) by means of the classical 
method of Lagrange multipliers. If ),...,,( 21 Nααα=α  denotes N nonnegative Lagrange multipliers

distance w1 ; on the contrary, a larger C will lead to minimize the number of misclassified points.

zero value. In other words, all of the measures were positive (from 0.5 to 1.9) which indicated that the sign 
property was not enough to distinguish the samples. Instead, we used the p-value equal to 10-5 as the 
indicator to test the statistical significance of the difference among clusters. As a result, 125 lots of 140 
total wafer lots showed a good spatial clustering condition. To effectively distinguish the characteristics of 
the wafer map, we also conducted the filtering process to reduce the noise of the wafer map.  
 
4.3 Feature selection 
The features used in this study are mainly selected from the co-occurrence matrix and Hu’s moment 
invariants. There are eleven features in total. Except Hu’s seven moment invariants, the other four features 
selected from co-occurrence matrix have to consider the interval (number of pixel) and angle. In our 
experiment, the operating characteristic curves for the four features were very similar to each other in term 
of interval and angle. Therefore, the number of pixel was set to d=1 and angle was set to 0 degree. Table 
4-1 shows three wafer map images with complexity increasing from map 1 to map 3. Accordingly, the 
value of the contrast and the entropy are increasingly related to the degree of complication of wafer map. 
On the other hand, the value of the energy and the local homogeneity are decreasingly related to the 
degree of complication. Thus, maximizing the first two values and minimizing the second two values can 
demonstrate the characteristics of features.

Wafermap-2 0.11 2.31 3.417 1.69 
Wafermap-3 0.07 2.99 3.844 1.63 
 
4.4 SOM clustering 
The choice of the right number of class for an unsupervised network is an open problem. In fact, 
increasing the number of clusters improves the likelihood of finding market niches. Hence, we conduct the 
unsupervised neural network SOM combined with SVM classifier for validation. The input data for 
training SOM were 125 lots wafer bin map with 11 features and the output 2-D feature maps were in 3×3 
and 4×4 dimension. The SOM parameters were set as follows: iteration: 10000; initial learning rate: 1; 
learning rate: 0.9; radius of neighborhood: 0.9; minimized radius: 1. Table 4-2 gives a summary of 
classifier results for 3×3 feature map of SOM. There are seven clusters in total. Two main patterns in Table 
4-2 are edge and ring effects. The percentage of ring effects is over 86% which is much more than that of 
the edge effects. Thus, it is important to reveal this information to process engineer for diagnosis. Table 
4-3 illustrates a summary of classifier from the result of 4×4 feature map of SOM. There are fourteen 
clusters in total. The main patterns shown in Table 4-3 are edge, ring, semi-ring and scratch effects. The 
pattern of cluster 5, 6, 8, 9 and 12 are similar to each other which is a semi-ring defect. The pattern of 
cluster 4 is almost the same as that of cluster 10 which is a ring defect.

4.5.2 One-against-one method 
In one-against-one multi-class classification test, as aforementioned, for each cluster 2/3 of the data was 
for training and the left was for testing. The Gaussian parameters used a γ set between 2-4~22 and C 
between 20~212. The prediction accuracies of one-against-one were all reached to 100% by using the 7 
clusters. However, some testing results of the 14 clusters do not reach 100% as showed in Table 4-6. The 
possible reason is that the number of training data in those cluster is not enough, therefore, it may not be 
suitable for SVM classification.

4.6 Comparison SOM-SVM to SOM-BP   
Table 4-7 displays the results of the average classification accuracies evaluated with the three 
multi-classifiers by using 7 clusters holdout method. The results of the two SVM classifiers yield better 
performance than that of the BP neural network. From our observation, we can claim that the SVM 
outperforms the BP neural network in our wafer bin map defect classification. Accordingly, the strong 
point of the presented work is the framework that it provides for designing computationally efficient 
solutions.

5. Conclusion 
We have developed a method that combines SOM with SVM using the holdout and k-fold cross validation 
method for wafer bin map defects classification. The main objective of using unsupervised SOM 
associated with supervised SVM classifier is to obtain significant computational benefits in large scale 
issue. The proposed approach also exploits the potential of SOM combined with SVM classifier in order to 
increase the higher prediction accuracy. The first stage corresponding to the feature map can be performed 
roughly to decide the number of neuron or clustering in a two-dimensional lattice of SOM. The second 
stage, a supervised training network, is applied to achieve a good generalization performance. The 
experimental result shows that our methods is able to achieve higher prediction rate either by using 
one-against-all or one-against-one multi-classifier. Moreover, it also outperforms the approach that 
combines SOM with BP classifier.
