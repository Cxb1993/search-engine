Abstract 
 
The objective of this research is to develop a low cost, robust, non-laser based optical 
sensor and to apply this sensor for simultaneous measurements of local equivalence ratio and 
temperature in turbulent premixed hydrocarbon flames.  The sensor system uses Cassegrain 
optics to eliminate the chromatic aberrations and to improve the spatial resolution for light 
collection.  Two types of light detection units, one is the spectroscopic unit with the PMT 
array and the other is the spectrometer with the LN-CCD camera, are tested in the 
experiments to verify their applicability.  Both types of light detection units are applied to 
the laminar premixed flames to demonstrate the capability of the light detection units for 
chemiluminescence emission measurements.  The PMT array provides fast data acquisition 
rate for chemiluminescence emission measurements but gives no information on the 
broadband CO2* emissions.  On the other hand, the LN-CCD camera measures the entire 
spectral range of OH*, CH*, C2*(1, 0), C2*(0, 0), C2*(0, 1) as well as the broadband CO2* 
emissions but gives slow data acquisition rate (about 1.5 s per image frame).  Although the 
LN-CCD camera gives slow data acquisition rate, the simultaneous measurements of C2*(1, 0) 
and C2*(0, 0) emissions provide a method for flame temperature measurement using the 
intensity ratio of C2*(1, 0)/C2*(0, 0).  Therefore, the linear relationship between the 
C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* intensity ratios and equivalence ratio as well as the 
instrument constant obtained by the spectrometer coupled with the LN-CCD camera are used 
for simultaneous measurements of equivalence ratio and flame temperature in turbulent 
premixed CH4-air flames to demonstrate the capability of the developed optical sensor.  The 
final goal of the research is to apply the developed inexpensive, non-laser based optical sensor 
system for real-time active control in industrial burners and hazardous waste incinerators.

temperature, major, and minor species concentration measurements [25-28].  The effect of 
turbulence-chemistry interaction on finite-rate chemistry, pollutant emissions, and liftoff and 
blowout mechanisms can be understood from Raman/LIF measurements. 
 
Literature survey indicates that more advanced instruments, such as high power lasers, 
spectrometers, intensified CCD (ICCD) cameras, fast data acquisition systems, and so on, are 
required in order to obtain more information non-intrusively from turbulent combustion.  
These measurements are usually named as “noble experiments”.  It is well known that the 
research budget would be cut more and more in the coming years due to an increased budget 
in Defense sector.  Thus, the development of low cost, non-laser based optical sensors for 
turbulent hydrocarbon flames measurements is an alternative to continuous building up our 
own localized combustion technology. 
 
1.2 Motivations and Objectives 
 
There are a number of optical methods that can give information about the combustion 
process non-intrusively, e.g., optical emission, absorption, fluorescence, and other 
spectroscopic methods.  The focus of this research is on the simplest of all these techniques, 
viz., observing the naturally occurring, optical emissions from the turbulent flames.  While 
there are a number of sources for optical radiation from a flame, the source most directly 
connected to the combustion reactions is chemiluminescence.  The chemiluminescence 
emissions are from electronically excited states of molecules (e.g., 
OH [ ]* +A X2 2Σ Π→ , CH [ ]* A X2 2Δ Π→ , and ][C 23*2 ΠΠ ad → ) that are produced by 
chemical reactions.  The excited molecules will transfer to lower energy states, in part by 
emitting light.  This is known as chemiluminescence.  Since the intensity of emission is 
proportional to the chemical production rate of the particular molecule, the 
chemiluminescence intensity can be related to chemical reaction rates [29].  For this reason, 
chemiluminescence has been used previously as a rough measure of reaction rate and heat 
release rate [30-35].  Thus, chemiluminescence can provide information on the presence and 
strength of the combustion process in a specific region of the combustor, making it 
well-suited for diagnostics and flame monitoring. 
 
Since the chemiluminescence intensities are produced during the chemical reaction 
process, the light intensity is related to the rate of production/consumption of that species.  
The reaction rate varies with reaction pathways which is a function of equivalence ratio, 
making it easier to deduce the equivalence ratio from the chemiluminescence intensity.  It 
has been shown that the ratio of OH*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and C2*/CH* vary with equivalence 
ratio in laminar premixed flames [36].  This non-laser based diagnostic technique has been 
applied to turbulent premixed flames for local flame-front structure measurement [37], to

RESEARCH METHODS 
 
2.1 Experimental Setup 
 
In order to gain a better understanding of the physics of turbulent flames and their 
associated pollutant emission mechanisms, the thermophysical properties of the flames must 
be measured.  Simultaneous multi-point measurements of temperature, species concentration, 
mixture fraction, and hence scalar dissipation rate have been made in turbulent jet flames 
using line-Raman/LIPF techniques [44, 45].  However, these techniques require expansive 
equipments such as narrowband excimer lasers, spectrometers, and ICCD cameras.  For 
example, the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, 
California, USA used four lasers, one spectrometer, and six ICCD cameras (see Fig. 1) to 
measure flame orientation and scalar dissipation in turbulent partially premixed flames [46].  
This type of experiment is out of our research funding capability.  Thus in this work, a much 
simpler and cheaper method is used to accomplish the same job.  That is chemiluminescence 
optical sensor. 
 
In the past, most of the chemiluminescence measurements used typical collecting lenses 
to monitor global emissions along the line-of-sight, and hence there was insufficient spatial 
resolution to detect the local flame-front structure.  The use of a 2-D chemiluminescence 
imaging system can overcome this problem [33, 48].  However, it is difficult to apply this 
technique to obtain chemical information about the local flame-front in turbulent premixed 
flames.  Therefore, an optical measurement technique using spatially designed Cassegrain 
optics to detect local flame emissions has been reported [49].  The schematic diagram of the 
Cassegrain optics is shown in Fig. 2.  The Cassegrain optics consists of a primary and a 
secondary mirror, which avoids the generation of chromatic aberrations for different 
wavelengths.  The Cassegrain optics is designed by the ray-tracing method.  The designed 
rms spot size of Cassegrain optics is 328 μm and the magnification ratio is 2.36.  In order to 
improve the Cassegrain optics for a micro-level adjustment and to connect with the optical 
fiber for light collection, the optical holder is re-designed.  In addition, a circular mask with 
different slit widths at the center can be placed in front of Cassegrain optics at the secondary 
mirror so that the background flame emission signals located away from the effective sample 
volume is minimized [50]. 
 
The schematic diagram and photograph of the measurement system are shown in Fig. 3.  
Chemiluminescence signals emanating from the sample volume are collected and focused by 
the Cassegrain optics and relayed to the entrance slit of a spectroscopic unit through a 2-m

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND OF VIBRATIONAL TEMPERATURE

3.1 Vibrational Temperature Measurement 
 
 The flame temperature can be measured using the intensity ratio of C2* emission 
intensities at two vibrational bands as proposed by Ishiguro et al. [51].  Fig. 6 shows the 
typical emission spectra of the two C2* bands [51].  The intensity ratio I1/I2 of the two 
vibrational bands is given by

a commercial package CFD-ACE are also performed to investigate the flame structures.  The

spectrum for wavelength covered from 208 to 835 nm, a 150 grooves/mm grating (12.8 
nm/mm) is used.  It can be seen from Fig. 10 that for φ = 0.85, the peak emissions of OH*(0, 
0) at 307 nm, CH*(0, 0) at 430 nm, C2*(1, 0) at 470 nm, and C2*(0, 0) at 516 nm are visible 
in the spectrum.  These emissions are due to following molecular transitions in the flame: 
OH*( ΠXΣA 22 −+ ), CH*( ΠXA 22 −Δ ), and C2*( ΠaΠd 33 − ) [55, 56].  Previous studies 
[57, 58] have confirmed that the primary source of flame CH* is from the reaction C2H + O 
→ CH* + CO, which might then provide a measure of the final steps in the C(2) reaction chain.  
The formation of OH* is from the reaction CH + O2 → OH* + CO, which might provide a 
measure of the final steps in the CHx reduction chain.  The formation mechanism of C2*, 
however, remains unclear.  There are a couple of reactions proposed for the formation of C2* 
such as CH2 + C → C2* + H2, CH + C → C2* + H, CH + CH → C2* + H2, or O +C3 → C2* + 
CO.  The reaction mechanisms and rate constants of OH*, CH*, and C2* have been recently 
investigated in low-pressure hydrocarbon flames [55, 56].  In addition to the peak emissions, 
there is also a broad underlying CO2* continuum [29] that extends from 280 nm throughout 
the sampled spectral region.  This broadband emission varies with equivalence ratio and is 
especially significant when the spectral bandwidth of the detection system is broad [41].  
Therefore, to obtain a more accurate measurement of chemiluminescence intensities, 
background correction based on the side bands must be made.  The polynomial fits of the 
side bands used for background corrections are also shown in the figure (red dashed curves).  
A linear or quadratic fit to the spectrum around the primary peak is employed, depending on 
the spectrum of side bands.  The curve fit value at ~310 nm is subtracted from the intensity 
measured, to obtain a corrected OH* peak intensity, and likewise at ~430 nm for CH* and 
from ~450 to ~590 nm for C2*.  In addition, the emission intensity varies with spectral 
location when the image is taken.  This is due to that the grating has higher quantum 
efficiency at wavelength around visible and lower quantum efficiency near UV.  During data 
processing, the emission intensity is corrected to compensate the quantum efficiency effect. 
 
 When the equivalence ratio is increased to 1.0, the peak intensities of OH*(0, 0), CH*(0, 
0), and C2* Swan band all increase.  The intensity of C2* Swan band reaches to a maximum 
value at φ = 1.3.  Since the chemiluminescence intensity of OH*, CH*, and C2* varies with 
flame equivalence ratio, the ratio of CH*/OH*, C2*/OH*, and C2*/CH* can be used to 
determine flame local equivalence ratio.  Generally, the strongest intensity of OH*, CH*, 
and C2* located at 306, 431.4, and 516.5 nm, respectively, is independently monitored when 
the spectroscopic unit coupled with PMT array is used for chemiluminescence measurements.  
It should be noted that the detector gate time must be long enough to measure sufficient 
chemiluminescence light, but short enough to reject stray light from background, if a 
LN-CCD camera is used.  However, the detector gate time is not an issue if a 
photomultiplier tube (PMT) is used. 
 
 16
9 mm for φ = 1.0 and 1.3 flames are shown in Figs. 12 and 13.  It is noted that the high level 
of intensities between the two peaks is due to flame emissions coming from outside the probe 
volume.  This fact suggests that although the present sensor is designed for “point” 
measurement, the emissions outside the probe volume are not completely eliminated by the 
eye mask.  Figs. 11-13 also indicate that the flame width is increased as the euqivalence ratio 
is increased from fuel-lean to fuel-rich conditions.  For instance, the peak OH* intensity 
locates at r = 3.51 mm for the φ = 0.85 flame at h = 3 mm and it shifts to r = 4.14 mm for φ = 
1.3 at the same height.  The increase of the flame width in the richer flames indicates that it 
requires a broader region for the fuel to be consumed. 
 
Comparisons of the measured maximum intensity for φ = 0.85-2.0 at h = 3 and 9 mm are 
shown in Fig. 14.  Results indicate that at both heights the maximum OH*, CH*, and C2* 
intensities occur approximately at φ = 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2-1.25 respectively.  These findings are 
in good agreement with experimental results of Kojima et al. [36], but depart from those 
measured by Jeong et al. [60].  Kojima et al. found that the peak OH* intensity occurred at φ 
= 1.1, CH* at φ = 1.2, and C2* at φ = 1.3.  Whereas Jeong et al. measured the peak intensities 
of OH*, CH*, and C2* at φ = 0.86, 0.91, and 1.06, respectively.  The closer agreement 
between our results and the data of Kojima et al. could be due to that a similar Cassegrain 
light collection system was used for the measurements. 
 
It has been suggested that the chemiluminescence intensity ratio of CH* to OH* or C2* 
to CH* or OH* and the equivalence ratio in hydrocarbob flames have a nearly linear 
relationship [36, 40, 61].  These suggestions were based on results showing that the 
chemiluminescence intensity was very sensitive to the equivalence ratio.  In addition, the 
possibilities that the effects of temperature, pressure, and the size of the flame on the emission 
intensity could be canceled to detect the equivalence ratio.  Therefore, the correlation 
between the chemiluminescence intensity ratio and euqivalence ratio at the flame front is 
investigated. 
 
Fig. 15 shows the results of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* against the equivalence 
ratio for the local flame front of the laminar premixed methane-air jet flames at h = 3 and 9 
mm.  In Fig. 15, the peak emission intensities of OH*, CH*, and C2* shown in Fig. 14 are 
used to determine C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH*.  It can be seen in Fig. 15b that near 
the burner exit (h = 3 mm) the fluctuational levels of C2*/CH* and C2*/CH* are higher than 
that of CH*/OH* due to low C2* emissions are produced at this downstream location.  At h 
= 9 mm (Fig. 15a), the scatter of the C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* is greatly reduced 
because higher emission intensities of OH*, CH*, and C2* are generated.  Figure 15 shows 
that the correlation of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* to the equivalence ratio is nearly 
linear when the equivalence ratio is less than 1.35.  The high degree of correlation suggests 
 18
 
 Comparisons of the measured maximum intensity for φ = 0.85-1.5 at h = 3 and 9 mm are 
shown in Fig. 22.  Results indicate that at both heights the maximum OH*, CH*, and C2* 
intensities occur approximately at φ = 0.95-1.05, 1.15-1.2, and 1.3 respectively.  These 
findings are in good agreement with experimental results of Kojima et al. [36], but depart 
from those measured by Jeong et al. [60].  Kojima et al. found that the peak OH* intensity 
occurred at φ = 1.1, CH* at φ = 1.2, and C2* at φ = 1.3.  Whereas Jeong et al. measured the 
peak intensities of OH*, CH*, and C2* at φ = 0.86, 0.91, and 1.06, respectively.  The closer 
agreement between our results and the data of Kojima et al. could be, again, due to that a 
similar Cassegrain light collection system was used for the measurements.  Comparison of 
Figs. 22 and 14 reveals that the uncertainty of φ in maximum intensity measuremeents is 
within ±0.05. 
 
In order to obtain a relationship between the intensity ratio and equivalence ratio for 
turbulent flame measurements, the intensity ratio of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* 
against the equivalence ratio for the local flame front of the laminar premixed methane-air jet 
flames at h = 9 mm is shown in Fig. 23.  The intensity ratios are calculated from the 
time-averaged integrated intensities that are corrected for broadband emission of CO2* and 
detector quantum efficiency.  It can be seen that the C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* 
ratios increase linearly with increasing equivalence ratio over the range from φ = 0.85 to 1.3.  
The high degree of correlation suggests that the local flame stoichiometry at the flame front of 
premixed methane-air flames can be determined by the spatially resolved chemiluminescence 
measurements.  However, it seems difficult to measure the equivalence ratio in methane-air 
flames for φ > 1.35 by using this system because nonlinear relationship is observed within this 
range.  These findings are in excellent agreement with those obtained by Kojima et al. [36].  
The log curve fit equations of the dependence of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* on the 
equivalence ratio are also shown in Fig. 23.  These curve fit equations will be used for 
equivalence ratio measurements in turbulent flames.  For all calibration conditions and for a 
given value of equivalence ratio, the C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* ratios are within 
±10% of the value given by each curve fit equation, which leads to an uncertainty of 
approximately ±0.1 for determination of equivalence ratio for 0.85 ≤ φ ≤ 1.3.  It should be 
noted that the uncertainty of our measurement system is approximately twice as large as those 
reported by Kojima et al. [36] and Hardalupas et al. [40], due to lower quantum efficiency of 
the LN-CCD detectors used in this study. 
 
5.4 Numerical Simulation of Laminar Premixed Flames 
 
 Numerical simulations of the laminar premixed CH4-air Bunsen flames at φ = 0.85, 1.0, 
and 1.2 are performed to investigate the flame structures.  Comparisons of the computed 
 20
constant C3 from Eq. (19).  An average value of 1.7759 is obtained for the φ = 1.0-1.5 flames.  
The φ = 0.85-0.95 flames are not considered for the determination of the instrument constant 
because the low emission intensity of C2*(1, 0) band in these flames may result in large 
uncertainty in temperature measurements. 
 
 Simultaneous measurements of OH*, CH*, C2*(1, 0), and C2*(0, 0) chemiluminescence 
emissions are made in turbulent premixed methane-air jet flames (φ = 1.0 and 1.3) to examine 
the applicability of the developed sensor system for simultaneous measurements of 
equivalence ratio and temperature.  The exit velocity and Reynolds number are 2.5 m/s and 
3200 for both φ = 1.0 and 1.3 turbulent flames.  The radial distributions of average OH*, 
CH*, and C2*(0, 0) intensities at h = 10 mm for φ = 1.0 and 1.3 turbulent flames are shown in 
Figs. 30 and 31, respectively.  Note that at each radial location a total of 50 spectra are 
measured.  It can be seen that for φ = 1.0 flame the OH* intensity is much higher than the 
CH* and C2*(0, 0) intensities.  While for φ = 1.3 flame, the CH* and C2*(0, 0) intensities are 
increased remarkably.  By applying the equations obtained from the laminar premixed 
flames, the histograms of measured equivalence ratio in turbulent premixed stoichiometric 
CH4-air flame at h = 10 mm and r = -9 mm are shown in Fig. 32.  The measured average 
equivalence ratios from the emission intensity ratio of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* are 
φ = 0.984, 0.987, and 0.992, respectively.  The rms of the local equivalence ratio is less than 
0.015.  Similar measurements of the local equivalence ratio in turbulent premixed rich 
CH4-air flame at h = 10 mm and r = -9.18 mm are shown in Fig. 33.  The measured average 
equivalence ratios from the emission intensity ratio of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* are 
φ = 1.29, 1.275, and 1.231, respectively.  The rms of the local equivalence ratio is also less 
than 0.015.  Comparison of Figs. 32 and 33 suggests that the emission intensity ratio of 
CH*/OH* provides better result for equivalence ratio measurement in fuel-lean to 
stoichiometric flames.  While the intensity ratio of C2*/CH* is more suitable for equivalence 
ratio measurement in fuel-rich flames. 
 
 Radial distributions of mean and rms equivalence ratio at h = 10 mm measured by the 
emission intensity ratio of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* are compared in Figs. 34 for φ 
= 1.0 turbulent premixed flames.  The measured mean equivalence ratio indicates that the 
stoichiometry of the flame is relatively uniform in the inner flame region.  The decrease of 
the equivalence ratio near the jet outer boundary is due to mixing with the ambient air.  Note 
that the equivalence ratio measured by the emission intensity ratio of C2*/CH* shows no 
decrease near the jet boundary.  This is because weak intensity of C2* is observed in this 
region.  Fig. 35 shows the radial distributions of mean and rms equivalence ratio at h = 10 
mm for φ = 1.3 turbulent premixed flames.  The intensity ratio of C2*/CH* estimates an 
equivalence ratio closer to a preset value of 1.3 than the intensity ratio of C2*/OH* and 
CH*/OH*.  This fact suggests that the intensity ratio of C2*/CH* is more suitable for 
 22
CHAPTER VI 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 In the present study, a low cost, robust, non-laser based optical sensor system has been 
developed and applied to turbulent premixed CH4-air flames for simultaneous measurements 
of equivalence ratio and temperature.  The sensor system uses Cassegrain optics to eliminate 
the chromatic aberrations and to improve the spatial resolution for light collection.  Two 
types of light detection units, one is the spectroscopic unit with the PMT array and the other is 
the spectrometer with the LN-CCD camera, are tested in the experiments to verify their 
applicability.  The PMT array provides fast data acquisition rate for chemiluminescence 
emission measurements but gives no information on the broadband CO2* emissions.  On the 
other hand, the LN-CCD camera measures the entire spectral range of OH*, CH*, C2*(1, 0), 
C2*(0, 0), C2*(0, 1) as well as the broadband CO2* emissions but gives slow data acquisition 
rate (about 1.5 s per image frame).  Although the LN-CCD camera gives slow data 
acquisition rate, the simultaneous measurements of C2*(1, 0) and C2*(0, 0) emissions provide 
a method for flame temperature measurement using the intensity ratio of C2*(1, 0)/C2*(0, 0).  
Both types of light detection units are applied to the laminar premixed flames to demonstrate 
the capability of the light detection units for chemiluminescence emission measurements.  
The measured radial distributions of OH*, CH*, and C2*(0, 0) suggest that although the 
Cassegrain optics improves the spatial resolution, the light emissions outside the focal volume 
are also collected by the Cassegrain optics.  The maximum intensity occurs at the radial 
position which indicates the location of flame front.  The flame front position varies with the 
equivalence ratio.  Comparisons of the measured maximum intensity for φ = 0.85-1.5 at h = 
3 and 9 mm indicate that at both heights the maximum OH*, CH*, and C2* intensities occur 
approximately at φ = 0.95-1.05, 1.15-1.2, and 1.3 respectively.  These findings are in good 
agreement with experimental results of Kojima et al. [36], but depart from those measured by 
Jeong et al. [60].  The chemiluminescence intensity ratio of C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and 
CH*/OH* ratios increase linearly with increasing equivalence ratio over the range from φ = 
0.85 to 1.3.  The high degree of correlation suggests that the local flame stoichiometry at the 
flame front of premixed methane-air flames can be determined by the spatially resolved 
chemiluminescence measurements.  However, it seems difficult to measure the equivalence 
ratio in methane-air flames for φ > 1.35 by using this system because nonlinear relationship is 
observed within this range.  The log curve fit equations of the dependence of C2*/CH*, 
C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* on the equivalence ratio are used for equivalence ratio 
measurements in turbulent flames.  For all calibration conditions and for a given value of 
equivalence ratio, the C2*/CH*, C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* ratios are within ±10% of the value 
given by each curve fit equation, which leads to an uncertainty of approximately ±0.1 for 
determination of equivalence ratio for 0.85 ≤ φ ≤ 1.3.  In addition, the maximum intensity 
ratios of C2*(1, 0)/ C2*(0, 0) measured in the laminar flames are used to obtain the instrument 
 24
measured temperature for φ = 1.0 flame could be due to the lower C2* emissions in 
stoichiometric flame.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this research is to develop a low cost, non-laser based optical sensor for measurements 
of local equivalence ratio in turbulent premixed hydrocarbon flames. The ultimate goal is the application of 
the developed sensor in industrial furnaces for monitoring combustion process. The measurement system 
consists of a Cassegrain optics coupled with an optical fiber and a spectroscopic unit. This paper reports the 
performance of the developed optical sensor by measuring the chemiluminescence emissions of OH*, CH*, 
and C2* in laminar premixed methane-air jet flames operated at several equivalence ratios ranging from 0.85 
to 2.0. Experimental results indicate that this non-laser based chemiluminescence sensor can accurately 
measure the radial distributions of OH*, CH*, and C2*. The ability of using the intensity ratio of C2*/OH*, 
C2*/CH*, and CH*/OH* obtained in laminar flames to measure local equivalence ratio in turbulent flames is 
discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
According to the energy consumption report [1], 
the amount of energy (77,875 KLOE) consumed by 
the industrial and transportation sectors was 72.1% 
of the total annual energy consumption in Taiwan 
during the year of 2005.  In these two sectors, 
about 90% of energy sources (fossil fuels) were 
used to generate power, process heat, and electricity 
through combustion. Extensive fossil fuel 
consumptions have resulted in rapid fuel depletion 
over the world as well as atmospheric and 
environmental pollutions. In order to burn the fuel 
more efficiently and effectively, the development of 
combustion heating and energy saving technologies 
is of vital importance. Various types of turbulent 
flames, premixed, non-premixed, or partially 
premixed, are employed in industrial boilers, 
process heating burners, internal combustion 
engines, hazardous waste incinerators, and both 
aircraft and land-based gas turbine engine 
combustors, etc. In order to control the turbulent

better than that (100 μm in diameter and 800 μm in 
length) designed by Kojima et al. [16]. 
Prior to the chemiluminescence emission 
measurements, the effect of the slit width of the 
eye-mask on the reduction of background flame 
emissions is examined. Figure 4 shows that the 
measured OH* with the mask have narrower 
profiles, while that without the mask yields a 
broader profile due to a contribution from 
background flame emissions collected outside the 
effective probe volume. We also rotate the slit 
angles and found that the measured OH* has a 
narrower profiles when the slit centerline is parallel 
to the flame axis. This findings is in agreement with 
that observed by Kojima et al. [16]. After 
considering a trade-off relation between the slit 
width and the signal-to-noise ratio of the peak value, 
we found that the best performance of the eye-mask 
for the present study is a 5-mm-wide slit with the 
slit centerline arranged parallel to the flame axis 
(see Fig. 2). 
Simultaneous measurements of OH*, CH*, 
and C2* chemiluminescence emissions are made in 
laminar premixed methane-air jet flames (φ = 
0.85-2.0) to examine the applicability of the 
developed sensor system. The radial distributions of 
normalized OH*, CH*, and C2* intensities at h = 3 
and 9 mm for φ = 0.85, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 flames 
are shown in Figs. 5-9, respectively. The measured 
maximum intensity of OH*, CH*, and C2* in the 
flames studied is used to respectively normalize 
each of emission signals, so that direct comparison 
of chemiluminescence intensity for different flame 
conditions can be made. It is noted that the radial 
location of local maximum chemiluminescence 
intensity is an indication of flame front position. In 
addition, the OH*, CH*, and C2* intensities of the 
hydrocarbon flames are functions of the relative 
heat release rate and their concentrations. Moreover, 
the profile of the OH* spectra has been correlated 
to the flame temperature and the CH* is an 
important indicator of the prompt NO formation 
[17].  
Figure 5 shows the radial distributions of OH*, 
CH*, and C2* intensities at h = 3 and 9 mm for φ = 
0.85 flame. It can be seen that the peak OH* and 
CH* chemiluminescence signals occur at r = 3.51 
mm and no C2* signal is detected near the burner 
exit (h = 3 mm). At downstream location (h = 9 
mm), the C2* signal increases and three emission 
signals peak at r = 2.25 mm. The shift of peak 
intensity location from r = 3.51 to 2.25 mm 
indicates that the flame front position moves 
towards the center of the flame with increasing 
downstream location. The low C2* emissions in 
lean flame conditions have also been observed by 
Kojima et al. [12]. Similar radial distributions of 
OH*, CH*, and C2* intensities at h = 3 and 9 mm 
for φ = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 flames are shown in 
Figs. 6-9. It is noted that the high level of intensities 
between the two peaks is due to background flame 
emissions. This fact suggests that although the 
present sensor is designed for “point” measurement, 
the emissions outside the probe volume are not 
completely eliminated by the eye mask. Figures 5-9 
also indicate that the flame width is increased as the 
euqivalence ratio is increased from fuel-lean to 
fuel-rich conditions. For instance, the peak OH* 
intensity locates at r = 3.51 mm for the φ = 0.85 
flame at h = 3 mm and it shifts to r = 4.14 mm for φ 
= 1.3 at the same height. The increase of the flame 
width in the richer flames indicates that it requires a 
broader region for the fuel to be consumed. 
Comparisons of the measured maximum 
intensity for φ = 0.85-2.0 at h = 3 and 9 mm are 
shown in Fig. 10. Results indicate that at both 
heights the maximum OH*, CH*, and C2* 
intensities occur approximately at φ = 1.0, 1.1, and 
1.25 respectively. These findings are in good 
agreement with experimental results of Kojima et al. 
[12], but depart from those measured by Jeong et al. 
[18]. Kojima et al. found that the peak OH* 
intensity occurred at φ = 1.1, CH* at 1.2, and C2* at 
1.3. Whereas Jeong et al. measured the peak 
intensities of OH*, CH*, and C2* at φ = 0.86, 0.91, 
and 1.06, respectively. The closer agreement 
between our results and the data of Kojima et al. 
could be due to that a similar Cassegrain light 
collection system was used for the measurements. 
It has been suggested that the 
chemiluminescence intensity ratio of CH* to OH* 
or C2* to CH* or OH* and the equivalence ratio in 
hydrocarbob flames have a nearly linear 
relationship [12, 13, 19]. These suggestions were 
based on results showing that the 
chemiluminescence intensity was very sensitive to 
the equivalence ratio. In addition, the possibilities 
that the effects of temperature, pressure, and the 
size of the flame on the emission intensity could be 
canceled to detect the equivalence ratio. Therefore, 
the correlation between the chemiluminescence 
intensity ratio and the euqivalence ratio at the flame 
front is investigated. 
Figure 11 shows the results of C2*/CH*, 
C2*/OH*, and CH*/OH* against the equivalence 
ratio for the local flame front of the laminar

二、 與會心得 
 
這次會議是由 McGill 大學負責主辦，由於 McGill 大學的大型會議室較分
散，從這個 Session 結束要到下一個 Session 聽報告需要花較多的時間，同時海
報展示之張貼會場離主會場也較遠，因此聽到不少抱怨聲。同時由這次會議讓
我覺得從事燃燒實驗或是數值模擬研究已走向合作研究的方向，尤其是光學量
測燃燒流場的研究更非合作不可，昂貴儀器設備的購買與維護已不再是每個研
究單位都可負擔，共同合作一起發表論文才能提升我們的學術國際聲望。

ARTICLE IN PRESSand reactor temperature oscillation [5]. The ﬁrst
two combustion techniques improve the ﬂame
instability by means of ﬂow oscillation resonance
and transverse wash of swirling ﬂow to the adjacent
ﬂames respectively. The swirling ﬂow is a typical
ﬂowﬁeld for gas turbines but it is not common for
other applications and the ﬂame oscillation is likely
limited to a speciﬁc situation. The third one uses
side-by-side jet array to create an interactive hydro-
dynamic eﬀect to generate vortex or ﬂow recircula-
tion between the jets and broaden the blow-out
limits. However, the diﬃculty of oxygen supply
does create a limit to bring these two diﬀusion
ﬂames in an even shorter jet spacing so the enhance-
ment of extending blowout limit is not as good as
expected. Therefore this method works very well
only to certain jet spacing as reported. The fourth
method attracts more attention recently because
it also improves the NOx emission. Nevertheless,
the cost of hydrogen is quite high. From the preced-
ing reviews, this study suggests the side-by-side jet
array as a reasonable solution to the stability prob-
lem associated with lean premixed ﬂames.
Jet ﬂame arrays impinging upon a surface were
widely reported by the researchers [6–8]. Their
focuses are on the heat transfer coeﬃcients of
the span-wise stream and the impingement surface
as well as the heat transfer rate of ﬂowﬁeld veloc-
ity, turbulence and convection. Recently research
papers [9–15] addressed the eﬀects of jet-to-jet
spacing and nozzle-to-plate distance on the heat
transfer of jet ﬂame arrays impinging upon a sur-
face, which is not the concern of this paper
though, but they did notice the tilted ﬂame shape
caused by a positive pressure gradient at the inter-
acting site. However, this positive pressure gradi-
ent was not appreciated and discussed further
owing to diﬀerent research objectives of these
studies. For burner arrays, Kimura and Ukawa
[16] and Singer [17] revealed the combustion char-
acteristics of the two-dimensional rectangular bur-
ner. Menon and Gollahali [18,19] studied the
interaction of multiple jet ﬂames in still air and
crossﬂow. Roper [20] reported the interactions of
two laminar jet diﬀusion ﬂames. Recently, Seigo
et al. [21] studied the ﬂame characteristics of low
load rich-lean burner. Most of the research men-
tioned above emphasized on the interactions of
the jet diﬀusion ﬂames but scant attention is paid
to the ﬂame structure, operation characteristics
and stabilization mechanism of the interactive
premixed ﬂames on lean combustion. Thus, such
interactive features deserve further studies.
On top of the previous studies [22,23] on stabil-
ity limits of interactive ﬂames, the present study
intends to explore the detailed ﬂame structure
and stabilization mechanism of interactive twin
jet ﬂames, based on the measurements of ﬂow
and thermal ﬁeld and detailed numerical simula-
tion of ﬂame speed, heat release rate and chemical
reactions on lean combustion conditions. To sim-Please cite this article in press as: H.-C. Lin et
j.proci.2008.07.030To numerically simulate the laminar premixed
methane twin ﬂames, the relevant governing equa-
tions were solved by using the commercial pack-
age ESI-CFD for ﬂow, heat transfer and
chemistry/mixing computations. A ﬂame-zoneThe experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1.
The aluminum slot burner is 160 mm in height
with rectangular exit made of 1 mm thick wall
and opened to an inside cross-sectional dimension
of 5 mm (called ‘‘d ”) by 50 mm. Both stainless
steel meshes and ceramic rectiﬁers were used to
straighten the ﬂowﬁeld. The ﬂow in the vicinity
of the burner exit was a fully developed velocity
proﬁle veriﬁed by particle image velocimetry
(PIV) measurement. There was no inert gas sheath
ﬂow around the burners. Methane and air
metered by electronic ﬂow meters were premixed
and guided into a manifold where the mixture
was divided equally to two jets. Twin ﬂames set
in dimensionless jet spacing L/d = 2  6 were
investigated in mean inlet ﬂow velocities ranging
from 0.7 to 3 m/s and equivalence ratio / was in
the range of 0.55–1.38. The temperature distribu-
tions were measured by thermocouples, and the
global ﬂame appearance was captured by a digital
CCD camera. The ﬂowﬁeld of the interactive
ﬂames was carefully examined by using PIV
technique.
Figure 1 shows the current PIV experimental
setup for ﬂow and postﬂame ﬁeld velocity mea-
surements. This PIV digital camera was equipped
with a mechanical shutter to prevent the PIV
image from ﬂame-illumination contamination.
The measurement system was made up of two
Nd: YAG lasers, a digital CCD camera, a pulse
generator, a mechanical shutter and a controller.
This laser system possessed two Q-switched Nd:
YAG pulse lasers (LOTIS TII) lasing at the
fundamental wavelength (1064 nm) and second
harmonic (532 nm). The wavelength of 532 nm
was utilized for whole-ﬁeld illumination and the
maximum pulse energy was 170 mJ. A high-reso-
lution and high-performance digital CCD camera
(sharpVISIONTM) was used. Each image contained
1024  1280 pixels, which rendered a spatial reso-
lution of 6.7 lm/pixel in the setup. The inter-
frame time for double-shutter mode could go as
low as 200 ns.plify the interactive premixed ﬂames for numerical
and experimental studies we used two
50 mm  5 mm rectangular slot burners to investi-
gate the eﬀects of the jet-to-jet spacing, inlet speed
and equivalence ratio between the two burners.al., Proc. Combust. Inst. (2009), doi:10.1016/

of inlet speed from 1.0 to 1.5 m/s. The only diﬀer-
ence is the ﬂame height getting taller along
increasing of the inlet speed.

To look further into this premixed twin ﬂame
interaction, interested cases were numerically sim-
ulated and their calculated pressure distributions
and stream lines were presented in Fig. 4 for L/
d = 2, 3 and 4. Because of the symmetrical nature
of twin ﬂames it is practical to just show one ﬂame
image out of the twin interactive ﬂames in Fig. 4.

the photographic image of the real ﬂame operated
at an identical condition on the left top corner of
Fig. 4. It is very promising of this comparison in
terms of the ﬂame shape and the oﬀset angle
between these two pictures. However the highest
ﬂame temperature of CFD calculation is 2080 K,
much higher than the experimental measurement
of 1800 K for the L/d = 2 case. And the predicted
ﬂame height by numerical simulation is only
0.3 mm shorter than the photo ﬂame.
4.3. Entrainment, recirculation and reverse ﬂows
The ﬂowﬁelds near the inboard gap were
numerically investigated and the ﬂame base areas
circled with yellow frames were carefully trimmed
and enlarged in Fig. 4. As noted, the computed
postﬂame streamline patterns changed when the
jet spacing was reduced. The variation of the ﬂow

reaction mechanism become important in the wall
proximity region between the burners. Figure 7
indicates that the HO2 concentration isopleth
fades from level 5 of the main ﬂame (left-upper
corner of the picture) down to level 4 near the
streamline IB-2 but rises back up to level 5 near
the rim wall. In the meantime it is found that a
pool of H2O2 builds up thicker and thicker
between the streamline IB-1 and the rim wall of
the burner. This H2O2 pool is generated by the
promoted reaction of 2HO2? O2 + H2O2 when

temperature background near the rim. The H2O2

j.proci.2008.07.030more eﬀective form for optimizing the HO2 gath-
ering eﬀect. The OH concentration in one spot of
the IB-1 streamline is rich enough to support the
reaction of OH + CH4? CH3 + H2O because of
the additional supply from stored HO2 and
H2O2 through the reactions of H + HO2? 2OH
and H + H2O2? H2O+ OH. As shown in
Fig. 5, the surplus of inboard OH mole fraction
is extended deeply into the gap of the two burners
along the reverse ﬂow, which implies a high tem-
perature zone with active chemical species does
exist between the two ﬂames and provides an envi-
ronment to stabilize the ﬂame. As observed, the
weighting of heat release contribution shifts from
reaction of OH + CH4? CH3 + H2O to
HO2 + CH3? OH + CH3O in the jet-to-jet gap
area. This inboard wall proximity eﬀect also helps
many other chemical species as long as they can
form an eﬀective proximity area or a closed angle
shape by the rim tip and the main ﬂame concen-
tration band. In this work those species are
CH3O, CH3OH, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8,
CH2O, H2 and CO. As noted, the OH radical is
not in the list above so the mole fraction of OH
is reduced near the burner rim area since there is
no wall proximity eﬀect for OH. Fortunately this
reduction of OH concentration ﬁlls up by the
stored HO2and H2O2. After all, the discussion
mentioned above is based on the calculation ﬁnd-
ings which were physically validated with the tem-
perature measured by thermal couple, the pictures
of the ﬂame shape and the ﬂow ﬁelds of PIV mea-
surement. In other words, all of the chemicals
with wall proximity eﬀect could have certain devi-
ation in respect to quantitative aspect.
In summary of the stabilization mechanism of
the twin interactive ﬂames, a schematic drawing
compared the inboard and outboard ﬂame stabil-
ization was presented in Fig. 8 at the jet spacing of
2d and the reverse ﬂow stage. At the reverse ﬂow
stage, a stagnating ﬂowﬁeld, termed lateral
impingement, is generated along the symmetric
axis between the ﬂames, similar to that found in
the opposed counter ﬂames but the temperature
is cooler than that of the vertical opposed jets.
The transition of the postﬂame ﬂowﬁeld, at the
short jet spacing scenario, is believed to be the
main mechanism to enhance the ﬂame stabiliza-
tion, especially in lean conditions. By regulating
the amount of entrainment ﬂow, this lateral
impingement ﬂowﬁeld provides a zone with low
dissipation of both the heat and the chemical spe-
cies in this area, which would favor the ﬂame sta-
bilization. The wall proximity eﬀect also turns
HO2 into H2O2 to accommodate more incoming
HO2 leading to additional OH supply for the com-
bustion. The OH radicals are diﬀused and trans-
ported by the reverse ﬂow into the impinging
area and react with the escaping fuel to generate
the additional heat in the gap region. It dramati-
cally helps the ﬂame base to be stabilized nearal., Proc. Combust. Inst. (2009), doi:10.1016/

1. Introduction
Lean combustion is generally considered as a
timely solution to the more stringent environmen-
tal regulations and global weather concerns in a
new era. However, the instability associated with
the lean ﬂame signiﬁcantly keeps the lean combus-
tion technique from being widely accepted as a
major combustion technique for general applica-Chun-Chin Ho a, Yei -Chin Chao a,*

Abstract
This study aims to investigate interactive parallel lean premixed methane ﬂames issued from twin rect-
angular slot burners with variable jet spacing, equivalence ratios and inlet speeds. The ﬂowﬁeld and com-
bustion chemical reactions are predicted by detailed numerical simulation with Skeletal and GRI-v3.0
mechanisms. Numerical results such as velocity streamlines, temperature, ﬂame height and ﬂame shape
are validated with those obtained by experimental particle image velocimetry (PIV) and ﬂame measure-
ments. When moved closer beyond a threshold jet spacing, these twin ﬂames become interactive and both
ﬂames tilt outward in appearance with a wider operational range of lean and velocity conditions. Numer-
ical predictions of ﬂowﬁelds found that there are three diﬀerent interacting stages: entrainment, recircula-
tion and reverse ﬂows according to jet-to-jet spacing and they are named by their characteristic postﬂame
ﬂowﬁelds between jet burners. At the reverse ﬂow stage, a stagnating ﬂowﬁeld termed lateral impingement
is generated along the symmetric axis between the ﬂames, which is similar but not identical to that found in
the counter-ﬂow ﬂames. As the jet spacing is reduced, the ﬂowﬁeld transition of the interacting postﬂame
stages is believed to be the main mechanism to enhance the ﬂame stabilization, especially in lean condi-
tions. This reverse ﬂow pattern provides a hot and slow postﬂame ﬂowﬁeld and transports the residualA comprehensive study

Fig. 2. Illustration of CFD computational domain and
boundary conditions.1.38 respectively from left to right. As shown in
middle part of Fig. 3 each pair of ﬂames expels
each other and looks like an ‘‘M-shape” ﬂame
on the mild lean area. They form a conical or
up-side-down ‘‘U-shape” ﬂame [1] as equivalence
ratio goes richer than 1.4 and the inboard rim
ﬂames are lifted oﬀ. The ‘‘V-shape” ﬂame consists
of two half lift-oﬀ ﬂames anchored on inboard
side of each burner only on the extremely lean
combustion. Figure 3 also shows that the L/
d = 2 burners can sustain a ﬂame even when the
equivalence ratio goes lower than 0.55, lower than
the ordinary ﬂammability limit. As illustrated in
Fig. 4 the ﬂame oﬀset angle is deﬁned by the ratio
of the oﬀset distance of ﬂame tip from jet central
axis to the ﬂame height. The oﬀset angle becomes

strongly related with the enhancement of the
inboard ﬂame stabilization, especially for lean
conditions. Along the decrease of jet spacing from
L/d = 4–2, the ﬂowﬁeld near the inboard gap
changed from entrainment ﬂow for L/d = 4, recir-
culation ﬂow for L/d = 3, and ﬁnally up to an
‘‘impingement” reverse ﬂow for L/d = 2. The
‘‘impingement” reverse ﬂow depicts a characteris-
tic stagnating ﬂow. The postﬂame ﬂowﬁeld for the
L/d = 4 ﬂame has a streamline pattern as straight-
forward as that of an ordinary postﬂame ﬂow
entraining the ambient air into the symmetric axis
except a less pronounced local pressure peak out-
standing from the yellow background. This local
pressure peak is due to the limited space in this
minor impinging area. For the case of L/d = 3, a
local recirculation region of entrained ﬂow at the
symmetric axis is formed and the pressure peak
at the symmetric axis becomes pronounced, push-
lated streamlines and the ﬁrst three streamlines
designated as IB-1, IB-2 and IB-3 for inboard
rim and OB-1, OB-2 and OB-3 for outboard one
respectively.
This impingement area has an obvious stagna-
tion point and the computed streamlines were
carefully veriﬁed by the PIV measurement as
denoted in uniform velocity vectors (show only
the direction) in the middle picture of Fig. 5. This
eﬀect can be designated as a lateral or an angled
counter-ﬂow and classiﬁed as a typical stagna-
tion-ﬂow ﬂame. The diﬀerences between the
inboard and outboard regions in the ﬂowﬁeld pat-
tern signiﬁcantly aﬀect the characteristics of the
ﬂame and the reaction near the burner rim as
depicted by the color-coded OH and CO concen-
tration distributions in Fig. 5. The characteristics
of the thermal and the ﬂame near the burner rim
will directly inﬂuence the ﬂame stabilization. The

is L/d = 2, the postﬂame streamlines impinge each
other severely and a reverse ﬂow is generated, cre-
ating a ﬂame and a ﬂowﬁeld structure similar to
those found in the counter-ﬂow ﬂame. At this case
entrainment of ambient air is completely blocked.
4.4. Flame stabilization and lateral impingement
The counter-ﬂow can also create a hydrody-
namic eﬀect to enhance the ﬂame stabilization. It
[24] reported that a counter-ﬂow ﬂame can burn
methane–air mixture with an equivalence ratio
as lean as of 0.45. Figure 5 shows the lateral
impingement demonstrated by overlapping
streamlines and PIV uniform vectors in the back-
ground of the XOH (left two pictures) and XCO
(right one) mole concentration. The three blank
rectangular areas represent the left three burner
rims of the twin jet burners at the jet spacing of
L/d = 2. The origin of x-axis is located just right
on the symmetrical line and that of y-axis is lined
up with the tip of the rim. It also shows the calcu-

taper-up static pressure ﬂowﬁeld as shown in
Fig. 6 and the ﬂow velocity needs to be reduced
to around zero at the impinged point within a rel-
atively short distance. Therefore in Fig. 6 the
velocity magnitude of the entire inboard side is
reduced while that of the outboard side is acceler-
ated. The temperature along the streamlines IB-2
and IB-3 goes up between the streamline coordi-
nate of 2 and 3 mm in the postﬂame of the gap
region. These characteristics of the reduced veloc-
ity and the increasing temperature in the post-
ﬂame provide extended residence time and richer
chemical species, which in turn favor the combus-
tion process in this region.

This study is intended to look into the entire
phenomenon of two lean premixed methane ﬂames
placed within interactive jet spacing. The parallel
interactive premixed methane ﬂames are identiﬁed
numerically and experimentally as a phenomenon
of lateral impingement of postﬂames or angled
counter-ﬂow ﬂames. These parallel stagnation
ﬂames possess a few typical characteristics of coun-
ter-ﬂow ﬂames such as the ﬂame stretching and the
enhanced ﬂame stabilization observed in this study.
Besides, there are some new ﬁndings obtained to
explain how the impingement ﬂowﬁeld in the gap
region between the burners near the burner rim
helps the stabilization of the ﬂame in terms of
hydrodynamic, thermal and chemical species con-
tributions. This ﬂame stabilization mechanism
was comprehensively explained in this study.
