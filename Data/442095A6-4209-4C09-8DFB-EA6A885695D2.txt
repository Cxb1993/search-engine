1. Introduction 
Arsenic is a contaminant of concern in groundwater. It is well-known that arsenic is stable in 
several oxidation states, such as the As(III), mainly found in reducing condition, and As(V), stable in 
oxidizing state. Both are the most common forms of arsenic in natural waters (Smedley and Kinniburgh 
2001). Consuming water with high level of arsenic can cause skin, lung, bladder or kidney cancers and 
black foot diseases (Mohan and Pittman Jr 2007). Thus, the search for technologies that focus on arsenic 
removal in groundwater still continues. Some of the technologies that are now being used for the 
removal of arsenic from groundwater include precipitation, coagulation and filtration, reverse osmosis, 
electrodialysis, and ion exchange (Triszcz et al. 2009). However, the technologies mentioned above are 
effective mostly for As(V) removal, and a pre-oxidation step is required to transform As(III) to As(V) 
(Lackovic et al. 2000).  
Adsorption process by using zero-valent iron (ZVI) is a promising alternative for arsenic 
removal because this sorption media was used to remove both As(V) and As(III) simultaneously, 
without pre-oxidation step (Sun et al. 2006) and such process does not require the use of additional 
chemical reagents. Lackovic et al. (2000) first reported arsenic removal by using ZVI in 2000. They 
reported that ZVI has a high capacity for arsenic remediation. Afterwards, there were many reports 
about arsenic removal by ZVI. Bang et al. (2005) used iron filings, which were pretreated by acid to 
remove the oxide layer, for arsenic removal in a batch system. They revealed that the removal rate of 
As(V) under oxic condition was faster  than anoxic condition and the removal rate was higher at pH 4 
than at pH 7. Sun et al. (2006) performed experiments by using packed column of iron chippings, which 
were obtained from industrial waste and screened to less than 20 mesh. Their results show that As(III) 
was removed more rapidly than As(V) under anaerobic condition, but the reverse phenomenon was 
observed under aerobic condition. Melitas et al. (2002) demonstrated the effectiveness of packed column 
of iron fillings for As(V) removal. They concluded that the performance of As(V) removal depends not 
only on the adsorptive sites of iron oxide generated from reaction, but also on the ability of As(V) 
reaching those adsorptive sites. However, the problem associated with the use of ZVI is that the reaction 
time required for the complete removal of arsenic is in days (Jegadeesan et al. 2005). Based on the 
method of nano-scale zero-valent iron (NZVI) synthesis developed by Lehigh University research group 
in 1995 (Glavee et al. 1995), it was found that NZVI possesses higher capacity for arsenic removal than 
micro-scale zero-valent iron (MZVI) (Kanel et al. 2006; Giasuddin et al. 2007).  
In natural groundwater the ratio of As(III) and As(V) can vary significantly, depending on 
condition of in situ oxidation state of water (Sasaki et al. 2009). There is a lack of documents reporting 
on treatment of arsenic with different ratios of As(III) and As(V). Thus, this study investigated such 
aspect of arsenic removal. In addition, the effects of solution pH, initial arsenic concentration, and DO 
on the rates of arsenic removal by NZVI were studied as well.

dissolved oxygen was measured by DO meter (Oxi 330i). The total arsenic, (As(V) and As(III)), was 
determined by inductively coupled argon plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using 
Thermo Scientific Model iCAP 6000 series (Thermo Scientific, USA). Determination of individual 
arsenic species was conducted by using an anion-exchange cartridge, DSC-SAX 500 mg (Supelco) 
(Kom et al. 2004). As the arsenic-bearing water samples pass through the cartridge, the As(V) will be 
retained inside, while the As(III) will be carried out, rendering the separation of As(V) and As(III) from 
each other. The eluent is then analyzed for the As(III) concentration by ICP. Finally, the As(V) 
concentration is obtained by subtracting the measured As(III) concentration from the total arsenic 
concentration.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of initial pH 
The initial arsenic concentration (Co) applied was 1000 g/L, while the initial pH’s of the 
solution studied were 4.0, 7.0 and 9.0. As presented in Figure 2, the adsorption reaction of As(III) 
reached equilibrium at times of 10, 15, and 30 min for pH 4, 7, and 9, respectively, whereas As(V) 
reached equilibrium at times of 7, 20, and 40 min for the corresponding pH’s. The percentage removal at 
equilibrium for pH 4 was around 81% of the initial arsenic concentration for As(III), and it was 99% for 
As(V). When the initial solution pH was raised to pH 7, the removal percentage at equilibrium for As(V) 
decreased to 95%; on the contrary, it increased to 88% for As(III). However, with pH 9, significant 
reduction in the adsorbed As(III), and As(V) was observed, the removal percentages of which at 
equilibrium were 65% and 85%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the adsorption performance 
of arsenic is highly influenced by initial solution pH, as also evidenced by other similar researches 
(Borah et al. 2009).  
Arsenic can exist in different forms, depending on the pH condition. According to this study, the 
pHpzc for NZVI synthesized was 7.8, while the available literature data of pHpzc for iron oxides was 8.0 
(Li et al. 2006). Also, the pKa values reported for As(III) are listed as follows: pK1 = 9.22, pK2 = 12.13, 
and pK3 = 12.7; and for As(V), they are: pK1 = 2.2, pK2 = 6.97, and pK3 = 11.53 (Raven et al. 1998). In

To understand the NZVI behavior more in the solution, the pH, DO and ORP profiles were 
further illustrated in Figure 2. The results show that the final solution pH were increased for both As(III) 
and As(V) when the initial pH were 4 and 7. However, in the case of initial pH 9, the pH value dropped 
slightly to 8.5-8.7. The pH was observed to increase in the presence of Fe0 due to the reaction of NZVI 
with water and dissolved oxygen, which resulted in the formation of hydroxide and the consumption of 
DO in solution. The reactions are presented by Equations (2) and (3) (Ruangchainikom et al. 2006).  
 
Fe0 + 2H2O ↔ Fe2+ + H2 + 2OH-                 (2) 
2Fe0 + 2H2O + O2 ↔ 2Fe2+ + 4OH-             (3) 
 
The Fe2+ present in the aqueous solution can be oxidized by oxygen into Fe3+, which will result in 
producing corrosion products of different iron (hydr)oxides such as Fe3O4, Fe2O3, FeOOH, Fe(OH)2, 
and Fe(OH)3, depending on the solution conditions (Triszcz  et al. 2009; Giasuddin  et al. 2007; Kanel et 
al. 2005; Huang and Zhang 2005). According to Figure 2, the ORP value decreased rapidly from 
positive values to negative ones. Such phenomenon occurs due to electrons being released from the 
reductant. In only 5 min of reaction, the ORP values have dropped down to the very negative range, 
indicating that the solution exhibited a state of reducing environment in the presence of NZVI 
(Ruangchainikom et al. 2006).

In view of NZVI capacity for arsenic removal under various pH conditions, the data presented in 
Figure 2 were further analyzed according to Equation (4) (Borah et al. 2009): 
 
                                        m (qe − qo) = V (Co − Ce)                                                     (4) 
 
Where m is the mass of the NZVI (g); qo and qe are the arsenic removed by the NZVI (mg/g) at 
initial and equilibrium conditions, respectively; Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations 
of arsenic in solution (mg/L); V is the solution volume (L). The NZVI capacities to remove As(III) and 
As(V) under various pH conditions were calculated and presented in Table 2. As depicted in Table 2, 
higher NZVI capacities (qe) for As(III) and As(V) were observed at lower pH 4 and 7, when compared

where qm is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g), b is a constant related to the adsorption energy

As a result of data fitting, model parameters are depicted in Table 3. Based on the correlation 
coefficient, R2, the Langmuir isotherm model for As(III) and As(V) has R2 values of 0.99 and 0.96, 
respectively, slightly higher than those of the Freundlich isotherm model. Thus, it appears that the 
Langmuir model can better describe arsenic adsorption in the studied system. Note that the Langmuir 
isotherm assumes the site energy for adsorption being equal for all surface sites and each site binding 
only one molecule, i.e., mono layer (Montgomery 1985). As for adsorption capacity, both isotherm 
models show higher capacity for arsenate than for arsenite.  
According to the literature, the essential characteristics of Langmuir isotherm can be disclosed 
by the dimensionless constant, called separation factor (RL) (Qadeer 2005; ALzaydien 2009), as depicted 
in Equation (7).

mg/L, deoxygenated condition. Afterwards, the nitrogen gas remained continuously supplied into the 
reaction solution. The effect of DO in arsenic removal is shown in Figure 4. The As(III) removed was 
more than 80% after 10 min of reaction when the solution was under oxic condition, while 52% was 
removed under deoxygenated condition. For As(V), 99% and 76% were removed after 7 min of reaction 
under oxic and deoxygenated conditions, respectively. This indicates that arsenic removal can be 
enhanced in the presence of oxygen because arsenic can form inner- and/or outer-sphere complexes with 
the oxygen-induced iron corrosion products such as iron (hydr)oxides, according to several recent 
spectroscopic studies (Bang et al. 2005; Sunbaek et al. 2005; Mayo et al. 2007; Mishra and Farrell 2005; 
Zhang et al. 2004). Thus, the presence of DO will enhance the rate of iron corrosion and subsequently 
improve the arsenic adsorption as well.

removed easier than As(III) for the studied pH values. Concerning the DO effect, the presence of oxygen 
will help remove arsenic through oxygen-induced corrosion products of iron. In the case of initial 
concentration, the increase in As(V) did not greatly affect its removal rate, whereas the performance of 
As(III) removal decreased with the increase of its initial concentration. The presence of both As(III) and 
As(V) results in better removal of total arsenic than the presence of As(V) or As(III) alone. This study 
also reveals that the higher the mass fraction of As(V) present, the higher the amount of total arsenic can 
be removed.

arsenic causes skin, lung, bladder, kidney cancers and black foot disease [1]. As has been reported, 
countries affected by highly arsenic-contaminated groundwater include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, 
China, India, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam [6, 7]. To mitigate the health 
impact of arsenic, the USEPA has defined the maximum allowable level of arsenic in drinking water as 
10 µg/L [8].  
Several researchers have reported that arsenic can be removed by adsorption into a variety of 
iron (hydr)oxides, such as hematite (Fe2O3) [9], goethite (FeO(OH)), magnetite (Fe3O4), amorphous iron 
oxide (HFO) [10], and mixed valent iron oxides [11]. In addition, there was a report about arsenic 
removal by zero-valent iron (ZVI), which has a high capacity for arsenic remediation, including both 
As(III) and As(V) [8, 12-14]. However, the problem associated with the use of ZVI is that the reaction 
time required for the complete removal of arsenic is in days [15]. Based on the method of nano-scale 
ZVI (NZVI) synthesis developed by Glavee et al. [16] and Kanel et al. [17, 18] who investigated the 
As(III) and As(V) removal by NZVI, the researchers found that arsenic was rapidly adsorbed in minutes 
and a pseudo first order reaction was observed. In addition, their results show that arsenic removal by 
NZVI is more effective in an acidic environment. 
In summary, the As(V) can be better removed by iron oxides under acidic conditions than under 
base conditions, according to the surveyed literature [13, 14, 17, 18]. However, utilizing acidic 
chemicals to adjust the solution pH will result in undesirable species, which in turn will cause 
deterioration of the treated water quality. According to an earlier study [19], the above concern can be 
resolved by CO2 bubbling, which adjusts the solution pH to an acidic condition through  hydrogen ions 
generated from carbonated water, as described below: 
 
 CO2(g) ↔ CO2(aq)                          (1)  
CO2(aq) + H2O ↔ H2CO3               (2)   
H2CO3 ↔ HCO3- + H+              (3)  
HCO3- ↔ CO32- + H+                         (4) 
 
In addition, it has been reported that a high amount of NZVI is required for As(V) removal in 
field groundwater [17] because of the competition between arsenic species and background species, or 
because of the inadequate amount of the dissolved oxygen (DO) required for iron oxidation in the field 
groundwater. With such an understanding in mind, air bubbling was employed and tested in this study. 
So far, there have rarely been studies about the use of combination of ZVI and gas bubbling for 
targeted contaminant removal. Hsu et al. [20] used micro-scale ZVI (MZVI) and CO2 bubbling for 
nitrate removal from groundwater. They reported that solution pH dropped to 3.2 with CO2 bubbling 
(500 mL/min) within 10 min and nitrate levels were reduced by 85% in the presence of MZVI (2 g/L). 
Ruangchainikom et al. [21] investigated the effects of water characteristics on nitrate reduction by a 
combination of MZVI and CO2 bubbling. Li et al. [22] studied nitrate removal by means of a fluidized 
ZVI reactor under high-pressure CO2 gas. To date, no articles have described the use of CO2 and/or air 
bubbling in the NZVI process for arsenic removal. Thus, the main objective of this study is to propose a 
novel process for As(V) removal by NZVI, without the addition of acidic chemicals. First, experiments

In addition, Fe3+ (oxy)hydroxides are more likely to be formed than Fe2+ (oxy)hydroxides. The formed 
Fe3+ can result in coagulation of Fe3+ (hydr)oxides and thus can enhance As(V) removal [27-30]. In 
brief, a high DO level will enhance the rate of iron oxidation and ultimately improve As(V) adsorption 
as well.

3.3. Gas-bubbled nano-iron process 
According to Table 1, five scenarios of gas-bubbled nano-iron process were proposed in order to 
maximize As(V) removal. Scenarios 1 and 2 were performed with the initial pH levels adjusted to 4 and 
7, respectively, without any gas bubbling. As has been discussed in detail in Section 3.2, an acidic 
solution environment appeared to favor As(V) removal, and the absence of oxygen led to decreases in 
As(V) removal (see Figure 2). Based on these results, Scenarios 3-5 were attempted; these scenarios 
utilized air bubbling and/or CO2-bubbled acidification. 
Scenario 3 results in an improved As(V) removal at a neutral pH level in the presence of oxygen 
supply when compared with Scenario 2, as shown in Figure 3(a). Then Figure 3(b) shows that the DO 
for Scenario 3 remained at a relatively higher level due to air bubbling, while the DO for Scenario 2 was 
almost completely consumed by the end of the reaction. As mentioned earlier, the DO level is strongly 
correlated with the rate of As(V) removal. As shown in Figure 3(c), for every case in the five scenarios, 
the pH was found to increase with reaction time. 
Scenario 4 was designed to create an acidic environment by using CO2 bubbling, which is 
commonly called carbonation in water purification systems. As shown in Figure 3(c), the profile for this 
scenario demonstrates that acidic environment at the initial point in time was achieved as a consequence 
of the formation of hydrogen ions according to Reactions (1)-(4). Nevertheless, the solution pH 
increased as the reaction proceeded. This was a result of Fe0 corrosion [31], as depicted in Table 2 (see 
Reactions (6) and (7)). Figure 3(a) shows that Scenario 4 resulted in less removal of As(V) than the 
scenario with pH adjustment by H2SO4 (Scenario 1). The key reason was the stripping of oxygen 
28 
 
conceptual mechanism of As(V) removal in Scenario 5. The CO2 bubbling enhances the performance of 
As(V) removal due to adjustments of both pH condition (acidification) and surface charge of adsorbent 
(positive charge). The acidified solution favors the As(V)-containing form of H2AsO4-. The opposite 
charges of As(V) and iron (hydr)oxides accelerate the rate of mass transfer from liquid film to surface of 
adsorbent through electrostatic attraction force, as has been discussed earlier. As for air bubbling, the 
supplied DO enhances As(V) removal by promoting the formation of NZVI corrosion products, iron 
(hydr)oxides, which help adsorb As(V) in a significant way.

3.4. Field groundwater treatment 
Figure 5 compares the solution pH, DO, and As(V) removal profiles between Scenarios 1 and 5 
by using As(V)-spiked field groundwater. As shown in Figure 5(a), the total arsenic removal in Scenario 
5 was much higher than that in Scenario 1. Note that in the DI water system, the As(V) removal in 
Scenario 5 was comparable with that in Scenario 1, as illustrated in Figure 3(a). The reason for this is 
the smaller initial DO level in the field groundwater (see Figure 5(c)). As described earlier, the NZVI 
requires oxygen to generate iron (hydr)oxides, which help remove As(V). Thus, the lower the initial DO, 
the less As(V) will be removed. However, with Scenario 5, this problem can be resolved by bubbling air 
into the treatment system prior to NZVI addition. As shown in Figure 5(c), the initial DO was 
maintained at a relatively high level. Another reason is possibly the competition for adsorptive sites 
between arsenic species and dissolved background species in the field groundwater. As has been 
reported, sulfates, bicarbonates and phosphates play significant roles in inhibiting arsenic removal by 
iron (hydr)oxides [29, 32, 33]. Additionally, high levels of carbonate alkalinity may impact arsenic 
removal because of carbonate’s buffering capacity for acid. As shown in Figure 5(b), when CO2 
bubbling was applied to a treatment system with field groundwater, the initial pH (~5.6) could not be 
brought down to a level as low as the level with a DI water system (pH ~4; see Figure 3(c)).  
30 
 
Table 3 shows that in Scenario 5 the rate constant and the removal capacity for As(V) removal 
are much higher than those in Scenario 1. In contrast, the As(V) removal in DI water system remained 
comparable in both scenarios.

4. Conclusions 
 
This research concludes that As(V) was removed most favorably under conditions of acidic environment 
and higher DO levels. Adjusting solution pH to acidic condition by CO2 bubbling alone could not 
improve performance of As(V) removal because of stripping of DO. Pretreatment by CO2 and air 
bubbling in sequence is recommended for higher performance of As(V) removal. The advantage of CO2 
bubbling is that it creates a favorable acidic environment for As(V) removal without sacrificing treated 
water quality. The advantage of air bubbling is that it will help generate iron corrosion products, such as 
iron (hydr)oxides, which provide reactive sites for arsenic adsorption. When the NZVI process studied 
here was applied to field groundwater, pretreatment of CO2 and air bubbling in sequence were proven to 
be the most favorable operation for high concentration As(V) removal.

Abstract 
This study describes the removal of arsenic species in groundwater by nano zero-valent iron 
process, including As(III) and As(V). Since the background species may inhibit or promote arsenic 
removal. The influence of several common ions such as phosphate (PO43-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), sulfate 
(SO42-), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-), and humic acid (HA) were selected to evaluate their effects on 
arsenic removal. In particular, a 26-2 fractional factorial design (FFD) was employed to identify major or 
interacting factors, which affect arsenic removal in a significant way. As a result of FFD evaluation, 
PO43- and HA play the role of inhibiting arsenic removal, while Ca2+ was observed to play the promoting 
one. As for HCO3- and Cl-, the former one inhibits As(III) removal, whereas the later one enhances its 
removal; On the other hand, As(V) removal was affected only slightly in the presence of HCO3- or Cl-. 
Hence, it was suggested that the arsenic removal by the nanoiron process can be improved through 
pretreatment of PO43- and HA. In addition, for the groundwater with high hardness, the nanoiron process 
can be an advantageous option because of enhancing characteristics of Ca2+.

1. Introduction 
High arsenic-contaminated groundwater has become a worldwide issue of concern because of its 
toxicity and carcinogenicity [1]. The USEPA changed the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for 
arsenic from 50 µg/L in 1974 to 10 µg/L in 2001 due to its long-term health effect [2].  Arsenic is stable 
in several oxidation states, of which the arsenite, As(III), and arsenate, As(V), are the most common 
forms in natural waters. The dominant species of arsenic depend greatly on its surrounding environment. 
The As(V) is stable in oxidizing environment, whereas the As(III) is mainly found in reducing one [3]. 
Arsenic is typically associated with iron oxide under oxic environment, and pyrite minerals under anoxic 
36 
 
ferric iron was reduced by the borohydride, according to Reaction (1):  
 
Fe(H2O)63+ + 3BH4- + 3H2O   Fe0 + 3B(OH)3 + 10.5H2                                      (1) 
 
At the end of reaction, the NZVI particles were separated from liquid solution by a magnet. The 
dried NZVI was characterized first by TEM (JEL-2010, Japan) for its particle size. The solution pH with 
zero point charge, denoted as pHpzc, was determined by using zeta-meter system 3.0+ (Meditop Co., 
Thailand). Table 1 shows the physicochemical properties of the NZVI, including its particle size and 
solution pHpzc.

2.3 Batch test 
2.3.1. Single species system 
The NZVI (0.023 g/L) synthesized was added into a batch reactor with a volume of 4.4 L for the 
treatment of arsenic. The initial arsenic concentration was prepared at a level as high as 1000 g/L. Two 
levels of low and high concentrations for each selected species were listed as follows: SO42-: 10, 100 
mg/L; HCO3-: 50, 500 mg/L; PO43-: 1, 5 mg/L; HA: 0.5, 5 mg/L; Ca2+: 50, 500 mg/L; Cl-: 50, 500 mg/L. 
The solution pH was adjusted at the beginning of the experiment to 7.90 + 0.1. The solution pH was 
measured by pH meter (Suntex TS1), while the residual arsenic was determined by inductively coupled 
argon plasma (ICP) using Thermo Scientific Model iCAP 6000 series. 
 
2.3.2. Multiple species system 
In this part, the experiments were performed via a 26–2 FFD with resolution IV to identify factors 
which impose significant effects on arsenic removal. Using a resolution IV design guarantees that no 
main effects are confounded with two-factor interactions or other main effects, and two-factor 
interactions are confounded with other two-factor interactions [19]. The basic assumption of the 
experimental design employed was that the interactions higher than two factors could be considered as 
insignificant [22]. The design matrix of FFD of each stated species were given in Table 2. The low (-) 
and high (+) levels of each factor in this FFD were determined by following the same concentration 
ranges of single species system. It is noticed here that the confounding factor was found by considering 
the variables E and F as the generators: E = A  B  C and F = B  C  D. In Table 2, the generator

adsorptive removal of arsenic (Sun et al., 2006). As shown in Figure 1(c), all solution pH profiles were 
observed to rise continuously throughout all reaction period, due to the build-up of OH-, according to 
Reactions (2) and (3). Such phenomenon was similar to earlier study with ZVI in micron scale [24]. 
(Ruangchainikom et al., 2006). However, the pH in the case of groundwater system increased quite 
slowly, possibly because of buffering capacity of carbonate alkalinity (680 ppm as CaCO3) contained in 
the filed groundwater.

greatly the performance of arsenic removal by the studied NZVI process.

3.2.2. Phosphate (PO43-) 
The effect of PO43- (1 and 5 mg/L) on arsenic removal was presented in Figure 2. The presence 
of PO43- inhibited the removal performance of arsenic, both As(III) and As(V), significantly. Table 3 
depicts the pKa values and predominant forms of arsenic and phosphate species, respectively. Such 
information indicates that the dominant dissociation species of phosphate and arsenic have similar 
chemistry, especially those of the phosphate and As(V). In other words, competition between arsenic 
species and phosphate for the same adsorption sites exists on the surface of iron (hydr)oxides [12]. 
Phosphate may be adsorbed onto iron (hydr)oxides through the formation of inner-sphere complexes 
with the hydroxyl groups [25]. In addition, the affinity of phosphate for iron (hydr)oxides was much 
stronger than arsenic species [4]. Therefore, the phosphate can retard the removal of arsenic significantly.  
 
3.2.3. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) 
The effect of HCO3- on arsenic removal was shown in Figure 2. The As(III) removal was 
inhibited dramatically in the presence of HCO3-, whereas the As(V) removal was affected only slightly. 
The possible reasons may be due to competition for adsorptive sites between HCO3- and arsenic species 
since the HCO3- can form inner-sphere surface complexes with iron (hydr)oxides [15]. In addition, The 
NZVI can be rapidly oxidized into Fe2+, the primary product, as shown in Equations (2) and (3), and this 
Fe2+ can result in several forms of iron (hydr)oxides, which serve as good sites for arsenic adsorption. 
Furthermore, in the presence of HCO3-, the generated Fe2+ may react with HCO3- to form iron carbonate 
(FeCO3) [26] according to Equation (4). Consequently, lower performance for arsenic adsorption was 
observed.  
 
                             2Fe2+ + 2HCO3- → Fe(HCO3)2 → FeCO3 + CO2 + H2O               (4) 
 
As reported in the literature, the release of arsenic from sandstone aquifer was found to be 
strongly and positively related to the HCO3- concentration in the leaching solution [27]. Also another 
report shows that HCO3- can promote iron dissolution from hematite (α-Fe2O3) surface [28], leading to 
the increase of the dissolved arsenic in solution. In this study, both low and high HCO3- concentrations 
show comparable arsenic removal, indicating significant impact by alkalinity even less than 50 mg/L.  
 
3.2.4. Sulfate (SO42-) 
The removal of both As(III) and As(V) was retarded slightly in the presence of low and high 
concentrations of SO42-, as presented in Figure 2. Such phenomenon was reported due to the electrical 
repulsion between SO42- and arsenic species [29]. Another reason is that the SO42- can replace iron 
(hydr)oxides, which were adsorbed on the iron surface, leading to the decrease of adsorption sites 
available to arsenic [30].  
 
3.2.5. Calcium (Ca2+) 
As shown in Figure 2, the efficiency of both As(III) and As(V) removal was enhanced slightly in 
the presence of Ca2+. The solution pH of this study was set at 7.9, higher than the pHpzc of pristine NZVI. 
42 
 
 
3.3. Multiple species system  
3.3.1. Arsenic removal with species concentrations of different levels  
The profiles of arsenic removal by NZVI in the presence of six selected species with 
concentrations of different levels were shown in Figure 3. It appears that higher arsenic removal was 
found in Runs # 4 and 8 for both As(III) and As(V). Both runs have the same concentration level of 
HCO3-(-), SO42-(+), and Ca2+(+). Thus, it is possible that HCO3- will play an inhibiting role for arsenic 
removal, whereas both the SO42- and Ca2+ play an enhancing role. In contrast, Runs # 2 and 10, which 
involve HA and PO43- with high concentration, gave lower efficiency of arsenic removal. Such results 
indicate that arsenic removal was retarded possibly by HA and PO43-. The analysis of effect of each 
species will be further discussed in detail by the FFD method. According to Figure 3(b), all the final 
solution pH’s were higher that the initial pH’s, due to ZVI oxidation (Equations (2) and (3)). 
Additionally, Runs # 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 15 gave lower final pH’s (< 8.2) because of higher 
concentration of HCO3-, which will provide higher buffering capacity for solution pH. 
 
3.3.2. Effect of main species  
The 26-2 FFD with resolution IV was chosen for the experimental design. Thus, average main 
effects were confounded with three-factor interaction, for instance, A = A + BCE + DEF, where the 
interactions higher than two factors could be assumed to be negligible. In this manner, all estimates of 
main effects were obtained [21]. The estimate of effect for each of the factors shown in Figure 4 is the 
difference between the average response of high level (+) and the average response of low level (-) of 
that particular factor in design matrix of Table 2 [20]. Given the calculation for the estimate of effect of 
factor A on As(III) removal as an example, the average responses of high level (+) and low level (-) are 
73.37 (= (54.99+72.16+76.23+73.63+89.36+64.62+82.30+73.76)/8) and 79.94 (=(84.94+86.88+75.33+ 
70.90+71.19+85.6486.21+78.42)/8), respectively. The difference between both levels is -6.57 (=73.37 – 
79.94), which is the value plotted in Figure 4(a). Note that the data for average response calculation 
were taken from those plotted in Figure 3. 
As shown in Figure 4, the negative estimates of main effect of A (HA), B (PO43-), C (HCO3-) 
were -6.57, -8.31, and -3.48 for As(III) and -2.9, -3.58, and -0.64 for As(V), implying that these main 
factors play an inhibiting role for arsenic removal. For example, increasing HA concentration from 0.5 
to 5 mg/L results in the decrease of As(III) removal by 6.57%  (the average response deceases from 
79.94 % to 73.37%, when HA concentration changes from low (-) to high (+) level), and increasing 
PO43- concentration from 1 to 5 mg/L leads to the decrease of As(III) removal by 8.31 %. In other 
words, to improve the removal of arsenic by the proposed NZVI, pretreatment of HA, PO43-, and HCO3- 
is strongly recommended.

14Fe2+ + SO42- + AsO32- + 14H+ → FeAsS + 13Fe3+ + 7H2O                   (7) 
 
Another report pointed out that SO42- can corrode the surface of iron (hydr)oxides, thereby increasing 
the reactive sites on the surface [30].  
In summary, among the selected species, the estimates of the inhibiting effects on the removal of 
both As(III) and As(V) are in the order as follows: PO43 > HA > HCO3-, while the estimates of 
enhancing effects are in the following order: Ca2+ > SO42-. As for the Cl-, it plays no significant role.  
 
3.3.3. Effect of interaction factor  
The effect of interaction factor was considered because of its large estimate of effect, as 
illustrated in Figure 4. A significant two-factor interaction indicates antagonism or synergism between 
two factors: their combined effect is not the sum of their separate contributions [19]. Interactions are 
presented in the model matrix by cross-products, as depicted in Table 2. The interaction AB are products 
of A and B, for example, Run #1: (-)(-) = (+), Run #2: (+)(+) = (+), Run #4: (-)(+) = (-), etc. [25]. 
According to Figure 4(a), for instance, the estimate of effect of interaction AB, or HAPO43-, was -5.73, 
but this value did not only result from the interaction of A and B, but rather from the estimate of effect 
of interaction of C and E as well (see Figure 4 for the confounding patterns, where the item higher than 
two factors could be considered as insignificant). This means that the interaction of (HAPO43-) was 
confounded with (HCO3-SO42-) and the relationship could be described as (HAPO43-) = (HAPO43-) + 
(HCO3-SO42-).  
 
Figure 5 shows two-factor interaction plots for each two-factor interaction, in terms of the 
percentage of arsenic removal. The interactions between factors are strong for arsenic removal due to 
factors in x-axis when significant slope of each line within each cell is observed; on the other hand, 
when the distance between the two data points (black and red) in y-axis remains sufficiently long, the 
interactions due to factors in y-axis are significant [35]. For instance, for the cell AB in Figure 5(a), 
Factor B shows strong interaction effect on As(III) removal, when Factor A remains at high 
concentration level (see the red line). On the other hand, when keeping Factor A at low level, interaction 
effect of Factor B still exists, yet to a lesser degree (see the black line with lower slope). If Factor B 
remains at low level, Factor A will impose no impact regardless of its being at high or low level; yet, at 
high level of Factor B, increasing Factor A from low to high level will lead to significant drop of As(III) 
removal.  
Specifically, as described in single species system, Factor B (PO43-) and E (Ca2+) were factors 
affecting removal; the previous one inhibits arsenic removal, whereas the latter one enhances its 
removal. Concerning the interaction of BE (PO43-Ca2+), the percentage of arsenic removal drops 
dramatically (78% to 65% for As(III), and 87% to 78% for As(V)), when PO43- changes its concentration 
from low to high level and Ca2+ remains at low concentration level. However, the PO43- poses 
insignificant interaction effect on arsenic removal, when concentration of Ca2+ is high. In the other way 
around, at low PO43-, the interaction effect of Ca2+ resulted in only slight increase of arsenic removal

Cr2O73-), heavy metal, arsenic, and organic compound [7-11]. However, the problems associated with 
the use of micro-scale ZVI (MZVI) are that the reaction time required is in days, and a considerable 
amount of iron is needed for complete removal of target compounds [10, 12]. This serves to address the 
need of more efficient nano-scale ZVI (NZVI) synthesis development. 
Currently, the NZVI has received widespread attention from field researchers for groundwater 
treatment because of its extremely small particle size, large surface area, high in situ reactivity, and high 
mobility in groundwater [13]. There were many techniques and methods for NZVI synthesis such as 
chemical method [7, 14], sono-chemical method [15], and thermal decomposition [16]. The sono-
chemical method will generate toxic by-product, CO, because this method uses Fe(CO)5 as a raw 
material [17]. As for the thermal decomposition method, the produced NZVI particles tend to aggregate, 
due to the loss of the stabilization ability caused by the disappearance of the initial reactant chemicals 
during the heating process [16].  
Since the NZVI has high reactivity with oxygen and water, inappropriate conditions for synthesis 
may result in the decrease of reducing capacity of NZVI synthesized. Thus, the goal of this study was to 
investigate the effect of parameters such as air exposure, pumping rate of reagents, and agitation speed 
of mixing on the reducing power of NZVI particles. The NZVI was synthesized by using the chemical 
method because of its ease and simplicity. In addition, there’s no need for complicated equipment or 
instrument for synthesis. In view of the best conditions for NZVI synthesis, one may characterize NZVI 
synthesized by specific surface area, particle size, and solution pH of zero point charge. However, all 
these are time and cost consuming. In this study, the produced NZVI particles were tested for their 
reducing potential by using nitrate (NO3-) as the chemical probe. Several studies reported that the final 
products of NO3- reduction by ZVI were nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), or nitrogen (N2), depending 
on the reaction conditions [18-21]. Possible reactions of NO3- reduction by ZVI were listed in Reactions 
(1)-(4).

In order to evaluate the impact of parameters for synthesis, experiments were designed by using 
two-level factorial design (FD). Note that the FD, widely and commonly adopted in industry, is an 
efficient tool for serving the purpose of this study [22]. Results from this study will illustrate the 
conditions for synthesizing the NZVI with the best performance. Additionally, based on the FD 
methodology, both individual and combined influences of parameters for synthesis on reducing capacity 
of NZVI were observed as well. Consequently, by using nitrate as the electron probe, this study provides 
an easy and simple way to characterize the reducing potential of NZVI.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Mass balance profile 
In the system of Fe0/NO3-, the reduction reaction involves electron release from surface of NZVI, 
dissolved Fe2+ or H2. Note that the latter two are the derived products from iron oxidation (see Reactions 
(6)-(7)), the reduction potential of which is generally very slow [24]. At any rate, the NO3- was 
reductively degraded by the electrons originated from the NZVI.

According to Figure 2, the mass balance profiles seem to indicate that the NZVI synthesized under 
condition of Run #5 was capable of reducing nitrate into end products NH4+ only, no other species 
formed in the reaction. Thus, Reaction (3) mentioned earlier was used to address reduction capacity of 
NZVI synthesized in this study.

3.3. Estimates of effects of interaction factors 
The estimate of effect for each of the factors shown in Figure 4 is the difference between the 
average response of high level (+) and the average response of low level (-) of that factor in design 
matrix of Table 1 [25]. Note that the data for average response calculation were taken from those plotted 
in Figure 2(b). As shown in Figure 4(a), the negative estimate of main effect of A (pumping rate of 
NaBH4) was -0.77, implying that this main factor play a negative role in regard to the reducing capacity 
of NZVI. For example, increasing pumping rate of NaBH4 from 4 to 8 mL/min results in the decrease of 
EDC by 0.77 mmol e-/gNZVI. On the other hand, the positive estimates of effects of main factors B 
(agitation speed) and C (air exposure) were 2.84 and 0.07, respectively; this indicates that these two 
main factors play a positive role, with the former one to a much greater degree. The effect of interaction 
factor was considered because of its large estimate of effect, especially in the cases of AB and AC, as 
56 
 
exposure, the EDC values drop from 4.7 to 4.0 mmol e-/gNZVI when the pumping rate of NaBH4 
changes from 4 to 8 mL/min. With air exposure, change of the pumping rate of NaBH4 poses 
insignificant interaction effect on EDC. On the other hand, keeping the pumping rate of NaBH4 either at 
high or low level, the EDC value changes slightly when the reaction condition varies from the one 
without air exposure to another with air exposure (4.7 to 4.5 mmol e-/gNZVI for the low pumping rate, 
and 4.0 to 4.2 mmol e-/gNZVI for the high pumping rate). In the case of interaction factor BC, the EDC 
remains rather unchanged whether the reaction is exposed to air or not, when keeping the agitation speed 
either at high or low level. But, the change of the agitation speed from high to low level results in 
significant drop of EDC for both conditions of without and with air exposure. Based on the above 
interaction analysis, among the parameters studied, the reducing power of NZVI is influenced by the 
following order: the agitation speed > the pumping rate of NaBH4 > air exposure. Such results can also 
be observed from Figure 4(a).    
                                     
                                      (a)                                                                            (b)

3.3. Conceptual interpretation   
Agitation speed. Two different agitating speeds, 100 and 300 rpm, were investigated in this 
study. The purpose was to compare the degree of NZVI particle aggregation. According to Figure 4(a), 
the higher the agitating speed, the higher the reducing power of NZVI particles. As may be explained in 
Figure 5(a), higher agitating speed results in more dispersion of NZVI particles, which in turn provides 
higher area contact between NZVI and nitrate. 
Pumping rate of NaBH4. To avoid surface oxidation potential of NZVI being produced, it is 
preferred that the reaction can be completed as soon as possible. On top of this, it’s always beneficial to 
save the reaction time for NZVI synthesis. Of the two feeding rates studied, 4 and 8 mL/min, lower 
reducing power was observed when higher feeding rate was applied. Choi et al. (2008) reported that 
rapid feeding of NaBH4 causes aggregation of NZVI precipitates (Figure 5(a)), whereas slow feeding 
results in oxidation of NZVI produced [17].

3.4. Characterization  
The NZVI synthesized under condition of Run #5, which led to the highest reducing capacity, 
was characterized regarding the morphology and histogram of particle size distribution (Transmission 
Electron Microscopy), specific surface area (Brunauer-Emmett-teller method), and the solution pH of 
zero point charge (denoted as pHpzc). Figure 6(a) shows that morphology of NZVI has two distinct 
layers. The inside core represents the Fe0 itself, while the outer layer covering the Fe0 is iron oxide(s). In 
Figure 6(b), the histogram illustrates that more than 95% of the particles are smaller than 90 nm and the 
average of particle size was 56 nm. The NZVI was further characterized for its specific surface area and 
a number of 7.67 m2/g was obtained. Additionally, Figure 6(c) shows that the measured solution pHpzc 
for the lab-synthesized NZVI fell at around 7.8. 
 
 
4. Conclusions  
In this study, the reducing performance of NZVI synthesized under different conditions was 
tested by using nitrate as a chemical probe. The results from factorial design revealed that the reducing 
capacity of NZVI will increase when the NZVI was synthesized under the condition of higher agitation 
of reaction solution (300 rpm). In addition, when the reaction solution-contained vessel was capped with 
aluminum foil (without air exposure), the reducing capacity for the NZVI synthesized was improved. 
The pumping rate of NaBH4 shows that low pumping rate, 4 mL/min, enhance the reducing power of 
NZVI. Furthermore, a quantitative index, electron donating capacity, for evaluating NZVI’s reducing 
power was proposed. With this index available, the chemical probe of nitrate can be adopted as a 
screening method for NZVI performance evaluation.

Contaminants removed by ZVI include halogenated hydrocarbons such as TCE, PCE, anions (e.g. NO3-, 
Cr2O73-), heavy metal, arsenic, and organic compound [7-11]. However, the problems associated with 
the use of micro-scale ZVI (MZVI) are that the reaction time required is in days, and a considerable 
amount of iron is needed for complete removal of target compounds [10, 12]. This serves to address the 
need of more efficient nano-scale ZVI (NZVI) synthesis development. 
Currently, the NZVI has received widespread attention from field researchers for groundwater 
treatment because of its extremely small particle size, large surface area, high in situ reactivity, and high 
mobility in groundwater [13]. There were many techniques and methods for NZVI synthesis such as 
chemical method [7, 14], sono-chemical method [15], and thermal decomposition [16]. The sono-
chemical method will generate toxic by-product, CO, because this method uses Fe(CO)5 as a raw 
material [17]. As for the thermal decomposition method, the produced NZVI particles tend to aggregate, 
due to the loss of the stabilization ability caused by the disappearance of the initial reactant chemicals 
during the heating process [16].  
Since the NZVI has high reactivity with oxygen and water, inappropriate conditions for synthesis 
may result in the decrease of reducing capacity of NZVI synthesized. Thus, the goal of this study was to 
investigate the effect of parameters such as air exposure, pumping rate of reagents, and agitation speed 
of mixing on the reducing power of NZVI particles. The NZVI was synthesized by using the chemical 
method because of its ease and simplicity. In addition, there’s no need for complicated equipment or 
instrument for synthesis. In view of the best conditions for NZVI synthesis, one may characterize NZVI 
synthesized by specific surface area, particle size, and solution pH of zero point charge. However, all 
these are time and cost consuming. In this study, the produced NZVI particles were tested for their 
reducing potential by using nitrate (NO3-) as the chemical probe. Several studies reported that the final 
products of NO3- reduction by ZVI were nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), or nitrogen (N2), depending 
on the reaction conditions [18-21]. Possible reactions of NO3- reduction by ZVI were listed in Reactions 
(1)-(4).

In order to evaluate the impact of parameters for synthesis, experiments were designed by using 
two-level factorial design (FD). Note that the FD, widely and commonly adopted in industry, is an 
efficient tool for serving the purpose of this study [22]. Results from this study will illustrate the 
conditions for synthesizing the NZVI with the best performance. Additionally, based on the FD 
methodology, both individual and combined influences of parameters for synthesis on reducing capacity 
of NZVI were observed as well. Consequently, by using nitrate as the electron probe, this study provides 
an easy and simple way to characterize the reducing potential of NZVI.

In the system of Fe0/NO3-, the reduction reaction involves electron release from surface of NZVI, 
dissolved Fe2+ or H2. Note that the latter two are the derived products from iron oxidation (see Reactions 
(6)-(7)), the reduction potential of which is generally very slow [24]. At any rate, the NO3- was

reduction. Thus, it is possible that the condition of low pumping rate of NaBH4, high agitation speed and 
no air exposure is favorable for increasing reducing capacity of the NZVI synthesized.  
Based on Reaction (3), the electron donating capacity (EDC, mole electrons per unit mass of 
NZVI) is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of NZVI’s reducing power of different types. The 
EDC can be expressed by Equations (8)-(9).

The EDC’s for NZVI synthesized under different conditions (see Table 1) were thus calculated 
by following Equation (9) and presented in Figure 3(b). In summary, the reducing power for different 
types of NZVI is in the following order: Run #5 >= 1 > 6 >= 8 > 4 > 2 > 3 > 7. 
 
Estimates of effects of interaction factors 
The estimate of effect for each of the factors shown in Figure 4 is the difference between the 
average response of high level (+) and the average response of low level (-) of that factor in design 
matrix of Table 1 [25]. Note that the data for average response calculation were taken from those plotted 
in Figure 2(b). As shown in Figure 4(a), the negative estimate of main effect of A (pumping rate of 
NaBH4) was -0.77, implying that this main factor play a negative role in regard to the reducing capacity 
of NZVI. For example, increasing pumping rate of NaBH4 from 4 to 8 mL/min results in the decrease of 
EDC by 0.77 mmol e-/gNZVI. On the other hand, the positive estimates of effects of main factors B 
(agitation speed) and C (air exposure) were 2.84 and 0.07, respectively; this indicates that these two 
main factors play a positive role, with the former one to a much greater degree. The effect of interaction 
factor was considered because of its large estimate of effect, especially in the cases of AB and AC, as 
illustrated in Figure 4(a). Hence, the two-factor interaction plots is further illustrated in Figure 4(b), in 
terms of the EDC.

and 4.0 to 4.2 mmol e-/gNZVI for the high pumping rate). In the case of interaction factor BC, the EDC 
remains rather unchanged whether the reaction is exposed to air or not, when keeping the agitation speed 
either at high or low level. But, the change of the agitation speed from high to low level results in 
significant drop of EDC for both conditions of without and with air exposure. Based on the above 
interaction analysis, among the parameters studied, the reducing power of NZVI is influenced by the 
following order: the agitation speed > the pumping rate of NaBH4 > air exposure. Such results can also 
be observed from Figure 4(a).    
 
Conceptual interpretation   
Agitation speed. Two different agitating speeds, 100 and 300 rpm, were investigated in this 
study. The purpose was to compare the degree of NZVI particle aggregation. According to Figure 4(a), 
the higher the agitating speed, the higher the reducing power of NZVI particles. As may be explained in 
Figure 5(a), higher agitating speed results in more dispersion of NZVI particles, which in turn provides 
higher area contact between NZVI and nitrate.

Figure 5.  Conceptual behavior of NZVI synthesized under various conditions 
 
 
Pumping rate of NaBH4. To avoid surface oxidation potential of NZVI being produced, it is 
preferred that the reaction can be completed as soon as possible. On top of this, it’s always beneficial to 
save the reaction time for NZVI synthesis. Of the two feeding rates studied, 4 and 8 mL/min, lower 
reducing power was observed when higher feeding rate was applied. Choi et al. (2008) reported that 
rapid feeding of NaBH4 causes aggregation of NZVI precipitates (Figure 5(a)), whereas slow feeding 
results in oxidation of NZVI produced [17].  
Air Exposure. As shown in Figure 4(a), the reducing capacity of NZVI synthesized decreased 
when the reaction was exposed to air. This was due to that NZVI became oxidized by oxygen, which 
came from atmospheric air and dissolved oxygen originally contained in the solution. In the case of 
solution-contained vessel sealed with aluminum foil (without air exposure), this can effectively prevent 
atmospheric oxygen from being absorbed into the reaction solution (see Figure 5(b)). Therefore, the

Abstract - Nano-scale zero-valent iron (NZVI) was used for the removal of both As(III) and As(V) in 
aqueous solution. Firstly, batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of initial pH and 
dissolved oxygen (DO). Arsenic removal rates were found higher in the system with lower initial pH 
and higher DO. Secondly, the gas bubbling of solution was the focus to improve arsenic removal by 
NZVI. The CO2 bubbling resulted in not only acidification of solution but also stripping of DO; 
consequently, the arsenic removal was observed to decrease significantly. Thus, with the gas bubbling 
scenario of pretreatment of CO2 and the subsequent air bubbling, it was demonstrated that the As(V) 
was removed remarkably, and the  As(III) to a lesser degree.

of concern can be resolved by CO2 bubbling, which can adjust the solution pH to acidic condition due to 
the hydrogen ions generated from carbonated water, as described in Reactions (1)-(4): 
    CO2(g) ↔ CO2(aq)                  (1)  
CO2(aq) + H2O ↔ H2CO3       (2)   
H2CO3 ↔ HCO3- + H+             (3)  
HCO3- ↔ CO32- + H+                 (4) 
In addition, it was reported that high amount of NZVI was required for arsenic removal in field 
groundwater [16], due to the competition between arsenic species and the background species of 
groundwater, or due to the inadequate amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) required for iron oxidation to 
enhance the process performance. With such understanding in mind, the air bubbling was employed and 
tested in the studied process. Thus, this paper focuses on the effect of gases bubbling on the arsenic 
removal rate by the NZVI, including CO2 and air. In addition, characterization of the NZVI behavior in 
solution was also performed for the treatment system design purpose. 
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHOD 
A. Materials 
The chemicals of reagent grade used in this study include FeCl3·6H2O (99%, Merck), and NaBH4 (> 
96%; Merck). Both the As(III) and As(V) stock solution were prepared from NaAsO2 (Fluka) and 
Na2HAsO4·7H2O (J.T. Baker), respectively. The H2SO4 and NaOH were used for adjusting the initial 
solution pH. All chemical solutions were prepared with deionized water (18.2 MΩ Mill-Q). Gases of 
CO2 (99.5%), Air (O2 21%, N2 79%), and N2 (99.99%) used in this study were purchased from a local 
supplier (Tainan, Taiwan).  
 
B.  NZVI synthesis 
The NZVI was synthesized according to Glavee et al. (1995) [14]. A liquid volume of 40 mL of 0.25 
M NaBH4 were added into 40 mL of 0.045 M FeCl3 aqueous solution to form nanoiron particles. The 
mixture was agitated by a revolving propeller. The reaction for NZVI formation is shown in Reaction 
(5).  
Fe(H2O)63+ + 3BH4- + 3H2OFe0 + 3B(OH)3 +10.5H2    (5) 
The NZVI particles formed were separated from the liquid solution using a magnet. Immediately, it was 
then used in the treatment system.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A.  Effect of initial pH and DO 
As shown in Figure 2, the removal performance of arsenic was highly influenced by the initial pH: 
the arsenic was removed more under acidic condition than under base condition. Such phenomenon can 
be elucidated from speciation of arsenic in solution. Arsenic exists in solution by different forms, 
depending on the pH condition. According to the available literature data, the pH of zero point charge 
(pHpzc) for iron oxides was 8.0 [19]. Also, the pKa values reported for As(III) are listed as follows: pK1 = 
9.22, pK2 = 12.13, and pK3 = 12.7; as for the As(V), they are: pK1 = 2.2, pK2 = 6.97, and pK3 = 11.53 
[20]. In the range of pH 2-7, the dominant form of As(V) is H2AsO4-, whereas the adsorbent surface 
shows a positive charge. The opposite charges of the ion and the adsorbent surface led to the 
enhancement of the arsenic removal through electrostatic attraction force. For the basic pH condition (7-
12), the dominant form of As(V) is HAsO42-, whereas the adsorbent surface became negatively charged. 
Thus the electrostatic repulsion force resulted in the decrease of As(V) adsorption. Similarly, under 
conditions of pH 4-7, the dominant form for As(III) is H3AsO3 which is with the form of neutral charge. 
Still this can result in attraction with the positively charged adsorbent, however, with a lesser degree of 
attraction tendency. However, for the basic pH condition, the dominant forms of As(III) are with the 
negative charges, H2AsO3- and HAsO32-, while the adsorbent surface is also negatively charged. 
Therefore, the As(III) removal decreased.  
Concerning the effect of DO on arsenic removal, Figure 2 shows that arsenic removal was enhanced 
in the presence of oxygen because arsenic can form inner- and/or outer-sphere complexes with the 
oxygen-induced iron corrosion products such as iron (hydr)oxides, according to several recent 
78 
 
profiles for Scenario 3 demonstrate that both acidic environment and high initial DO has been obtained. 
In addition, the removal efficiency of As(V) was higher than that of As(III). The As(III) concentration 
decreased gradually over the later reaction period, with the final concentration around 20% of the initial 
arsenic concentration, whereas the As(V) was rapidly removed and reached to its equilibrium 
concentration at 10 min. Such results indicate that Scenario 3 is recommended to achieve a satisfactory 
removal of As(V), without addition of any acidic species. On the other hand, it will take much more 
reaction time to remove As(III) to achieve the same degree of removal as As(V). Preoxidation of As(III) 
can be considered when Scenario 3 is applied.

Abstract— This study focused on arsenate removal by nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) in the 
gas-bubbled aqueous solution. It appears that solution acidified by H2SO4 is far more favorable 
than by CO2-bubbled acidification. In addition, as dissolved oxygen was stripped out of solution 
by N2 gas bubbling, the arsenate removal dropped significantly. To take advantages of common 
practice of carbonation and oxic condition, pretreatment of CO2 and air bubbling in sequence are 
recommended for a better removal of arsenate. 
 
Keywords— Arsenic, arsenate, zero-valent iron. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
rsenic is hazardous material. Consuming water with high level of arsenic will cause skin, lung, 
bladder, and kidney cancers [1]. The standard of maximum contamination level (MCL) of 
arsenic in drinking water is 10 µg/L according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [2]. 
Arsenic is stable in several oxidation states, of which the arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)) 
are the most common forms in natural waters. The dominant arsenic species depend greatly on 
condition of water environment. The As(V) is stable in oxidizing environment, whereas the 
As(III) is mainly found in reducing one [1]. The adsorption process by using ZVI is a promising 
alternative for arsenic removal because of its capability of removing both As(V) and As(III) 
simultaneously [3]. Lackovic et al. (2000) first reported arsenic removal by using ZVI in 2000 
for remediation purpose [4]; On the other hand, based on the method of nano-scale zero valent 
(NZVI) synthesis developed by Lehigh university research group in 1995 [5]; it was found that

As shown in Figure 1, the total bed volume of reactor used in this study was 4.4 L. In addition, 
the treated liquid samples were filtrated by using a 0.45 µm membrane filter and the solution pH 
and ORP were measured by pH and ORP meter (Suntex TS1), while the dissolved oxygen was 
measured by DO meter (Oxi 330i). The residual arsenic (C) was determined by Inductively 
Coupled argon Plasma (ICP) using Thermo Scientific Model iCAP 6000 series.

Scenarios 1 and 3 were adjusted by H2SO4 and Scenarios 2 and 4 by  CO2 gas bubbling. All 
solution pH profiles were observed rise continuously throughout reaction period, due to the 
build-up of OH- as presented in Reactions (6) and (7) [11].

In Figure 3(b), the DO profile for Scenario 1 was seen to decrease rapidly according to 
Equation (7). Whereas the profiles for Scenarios 2 and 3 remain rather unchanged since the 
solution has been pretreated by bubbling of CO2 and N2, respectively, resulting in low DO value. 
On the other hand, for Scenario 4, the air bubbling was supplied continuously throughout all 
reaction period, and this resulted in increasing DO value. In Figure 3(c), as the NZVI was added 
into arsenic-contaminated solution, the ORP value decreased rapidly from the positive values to 
the negative ones. Such situation occurs due to the electrons being released from the NZVI. At 
time of around 5 min, the ORP for all scenarios, except Scenario 4, were negative values,

skin, lung, bladder, kidney cancer and black foot diseases [5]. The standard of maximum 
contamination level (MCL) of arsenic in drinking water is 10 µg/L, according to USEPA [6]. 
Several countries have been reported that there was serious problem about arsenic in 
groundwater, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, China, India, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, 
the United States, and Vietnam [7, 8]. Arsenic is stable in several oxidation states, of which the 
arsenite, As(III), and arsenate, As(V), are the most common form in natural waters. The 
dominant species of arsenic depend greatly on its surrounding environment. The As(V) is stable 
in oxidizing environment, whereas the As(III) is mainly found in reducing one [7].  Adsorption 
process by using low cost adsorbents has been a promising alternative for arsenic removal. Zero-
valent iron (ZVI) was firstly used for arsenic removal by Lackovic et al. [9]; they reported that 
ZVI has a high capacity for arsenic remediation of both As(III) and As(V) simultaneously, 
without the need of pre-oxidation step [10], and such process does not require the use of 
additional chemical reagent. However, the problem associated with the use of ZVI is that the 
reaction time required for the complete removal of arsenic is in days [11]. As developed by 
Lehigh university research group in 1995 [12], the nano-scale zero-valent iron (NZVI) possesses 
much faster reaction and higher capacity for arsenic removal than the micro-scale zero-valent 
iron (MZVI) [13, 14]. However, the ion species contained in field groundwater such as sulfate, 
phosphate, bicarbonate, chloride, silicate, calcium, and humid acid may affect the performance 
of arsenic removal by NZVI. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the performance 
of arsenic removal in the presence of low and high concentrations of selected anions such as 
phosphate, sulfate, and bicarbonate by the lab-synthesized nano-zero valent-iron (NZVI). 
 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHOD 
 
2.1 Chemicals 
 
The chemicals of reagent grade used in this study include FeCl3·6H2O (99%), and NaBH4 (> 
96%), (Merck). The As (V) stock solution was prepared from Na2HAsO4·7H2O (J.T. Baker). 
The anions studied were prepared from Na2SO4 (Merck), NaHCO3 (Merck), and Na2PO4·12H2O 
(Merck). All chemical solutions were prepared with deionized water (18.2 MΩ Mill-Q). 
 
2.2 NZVI synthesis 
 
The NZVI was synthesized according to Glavee et al.(1995) [12]. 0.25 M of NaBH4 was added 
into 0.045 M of FeCl3 aqueous solution. The mixture was agitated by a revolving propeller. The 
ferric iron is reduced by the borohydride, as shown in Reaction (1):  
 
Fe(H2O)63+ + 3BH4- + 3H2O   Fe0 + 3B(OH)3 + 10.5H2                                      (1) 
 
  
Figure 2(b), the histogram reveals that more than 95% of the particles are smaller than 90 nm and 
the average of particle size was 56 nm. The NZVI was further characterized by BET method and 
its specific surface area was 7.67 m2/g. Additionally, Figure 2(c) shows the measured pHpzc for 
the lab-synthesized NZVI, the pH with zero charge, was 7.8.

3.2. Effect of anions  
 
3.2.1. Sulfate (SO42-) 
 
The removal of both As(III) and As(V) was retarded slightly in the presence of low and high 
concentrations of SO42- as present in Figure 3(a). Such phenomenon was reported due to the 
electrical repulsion between SO42- and arsenic species [15]. Another reason, as reported, is that 
the SO42- can replace iron oxide and hydroxides, which were adsorbed on the iron surface, and 
result in the decrease of sorption sites available to arsenic [16]. It appears that such results differ 
  
product, as shown in Equations (3) and (4). This Fe2+ can result in several forms of iron 
(hydr)oxides, which serve as good sites for arsenic adsorption. However, in the presence of 
HCO3-, the Fe2+ can form with HCO3- to generate iron carbonate (FeCO3) [19], as shown in 
Equation (5), which appears to have lower performance for arsenic adsorption than iron 
(hydr)oxides. 
 
 
Fe0 + 2H2O → Fe2+ + H2 + 2OH-              (3) 
2Fe0 + 2H2O + O2 → 2Fe2+ + 4OH-             (4) 
                                    2Fe2+ + 2HCO3- → Fe(HCO3)2 → FeCO3 + CO2 + H2O          (5) 
 
Some other article reported that the release of arsenic from sandstone aquifer was found to be 
strongly and positively related to the HCO3- concentration in the leaching solution [20]. Also 
there’s another article showing that HCO3- can promote iron dissolution from hematite (α-Fe2O3) 
surface [21], leading to the increase of the dissolved arsenic in solution. In this study with HCO3- 
concentration as high as 500 mg/L, the arsenic removal was comparable to the one with 50 mg/L.  
 
3.2.3. Phosphate (PO43-) 
 
The effect of PO43- (1 and 5 mg/L) on arsenic removal was shown in Figure 3(c). The presence 
of phosphate inhibited the removal performance of arsenic, both As(III) and As(V), significantly. 
Table 1 shows the pKa values and predominance forms of arsenic and phosphate species. Such 
information indicates that the dominant dissociation species of phosphate and arsenic had similar 
chemistry, especially the phosphate and As(V). In other words, there was competition between 
arsenic species and phosphate for the same sorption sites on the surface of iron (hydr)oxides [11]. 
Phosphate can be adsorbed onto iron (hydr)oxides through the formation of inner-sphere 
complexes with the hydroxyl groups [22], and the affinity of phosphate for iron (hydr)oxides was 
much stronger than arsenic species [1]. With this, the phosphate can retard the removal of arsenic 
significantly.

INTRODUCTION 
As was reported, the countries affected by high arsenic concentration in groundwater 
include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, China, India, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, the United 
States, and Vietnam [1]. The standard of maximum contamination level (MCL) of arsenic 
in drinking water is 10 µg/L according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [2]. 
Consuming water with high level of arsenic will cause skin, lung, bladder, and kidney 
cancers [3] which are difficult to treat by medicine. Arsenic is stable in several oxidation 
states, of which the arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)) are the most common form in 
natural waters. The dominant species of arsenic depend greatly on condition of 
environment. The As(V) is stable in oxidizing environment, whereas the As(III) is mainly 
found in reducing one [1]. 
 
There are many technologies for removing arsenic from groundwater such as precipitation, 
coagulation and filtration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and ion exchange [4], but these 
are only effective for As(V), and require a preoxidation step for As(III) removal [5]. As 
reported, adsorption process using zero-valent iron (ZVI) is a promising alternative for 
arsenic removal because this sorption media can remove both As(V) and As(III) 
simultaneously without the need of pre-oxidation [6]. Lackovic et al. (2000) first reported 
  
cartridge, DSC-SAX 500 mg (Supelco) was employed [10]. As the arsenic-contained water 
samples pass through the cartridge, the As(V) will be retained inside, while the As(III) will 
be carried out, rendering the separation of As(V) and As(III). The eluent is then analyzed 
for the As(III) concentration by ICP. Finally, the As(V) concentration is obtained by 
subtracting measured As(III) concentration from the total arsenic concentration.  
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effect of initial arsenic concentration 
As presented in Figure 1, the equilibrium As(III) concentrations remained at higher levels 
as its initial concentration increased from 1000 to 2500 ppb. Interestingly, as As(V) was 
applied, all the equilibrium concentrations approach to zero value, with its initial 
concentrations varying from 1000 to 2500 ppb. The arsenic can exist in different forms, 
depending on the pH condition. According to this study, the pHpzc for NZVI synthesized 
was 7.8, while the available pHpzc data for iron oxides was 8.0 [11]. Also, the pKa values 
reported for As(III) are pK1 = 9.22, pK2 = 12.13, and pK3 = 12.7, and they are pK1 = 2.2, 
pK2 = 6.97, and pK3 = 11.53 for As(V) [12]. As understood, the NZVI particles are with 
positive charge on the surface. In the range of pH 2-7, the dominant form for As(V) species 
is H2AsO4-, the negative charge; for As(III) species, it is H3AsO3, zero charge, as the 
solution pH ranges from 4 to 7. Such charge difference results in more favorable sorption of 
As(V) than As(III).

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
The contamination of arsenic in groundwater has become an issue of worldwide concern because of 
its toxicity and health hazards. Consuming water with high level of arsenic will cause skin, lung, 
bladder, kidney cancer and black foot diseases [1]. The standard of maximum contamination level 
(MCL) of arsenic in drinking water is 10 µg/L according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
[2]. As was reported, the countries affected by high arsenic concentration in groundwater include 
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, China, India, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, and 
Vietnam [3]. Arsenic is stable in several oxidation states, of which the arsenite (As(III)) and 
arsenate (As(V)) are the most common form in natural waters. The dominant species of arsenic 
depend greatly on condition of environment. The As(V) is stable in oxidizing environment, whereas 
the As(III) is mainly found in reducing one [1]. There are many technologies for removing arsenic 
from groundwater such as precipitation, coagulation and filtration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, 
and ion exchange [4], but these are only effective for As(V), and require a preoxidation step for 
As(III) removal [5]. Thus, adsorption process by using ZVI is a promising alternative for arsenic 
removal because this sorption media can remove both As(V) and As(III) simultaneously, without 
pre-oxidation [6], and such process does not require the use of additional chemical reagent. 
Lackovic et al. (2000) first reported arsenic removal by using ZVI in 2000 [5]; they revealed that 
ZVI has a high capacity for arsenic remediation. Then the synthesis of nano-scale zero valent 
(NZVI) was developed by Lehigh university research group in 1995 [7]; it was found that NZVI 
possesses higher capacity for arsenic removal than micro-scale zero valent (MZVI) [8, 9]. 
Specifically, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of solution pH on the rate of 
As(V) removal by NZVI, and the removal kinetics was explored as well. In addition, 
characterization of NZVI behavior in “pure” water was performed for the treatment system design 
purpose.  
 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHOD 
 
2.1 Chemicals 
 
The chemicals of reagent grade used in this study include FeCl3·6H2O (99%), and NaBH4 (> 96%), 
(Merck). The As (V) stock solution was prepared from Na2HAsO4·7H2O (J.T. Baker). The solution 
pH was adjusted by NaOH and H2SO4. All chemical solutions were prepared with deionized water 
(18.2 MΩ Mill-Q). 
 
 
 
 
3. THEORIES OF SORPTION 
 
3.1 Sorption performance 
 
The sorption performance is evaluated quantitatively in terms of arsenic uptake, as expressed by 
Equation (2) [10]. 
 
                                                   m (qe − qo) = V (Co − Ce)                                                     (2) 
 
Where m is the mass of the sorbent (g); qo and qe are the arsenic uptakes by the sorbent (mg/g) at 
initial and equilibrium conditions, respectively; Co, and Ce are the initial and equilibrium 
concentrations of arsenic in solution (mg/L); V is the solution volume (L). 
 
3.2 Sorption kinetics parameters 
 
The results of this study were analyzed by using the pseudo-first-order kinetic model in order to 
express the kinetics of the sorption process, according to Equations (3) and (4).

Where Co and C are the concentrations of arsenic at initial condition and time of reaction, t (min); 
kobs is the specific sorption rate constant (min−1). The half-lives (t1/2) of reaction can be calculated 
according to Equation (5).

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
4.1 Effect of pH  
 
Figure 2 presents the adsorption data under various pH conditions, which are 4, 7, and 9. 
 
 
The results presented in Figure 2 indicate that the kinetics of sorption follow a pseudo first-order 
reaction with a correlation coefficient value of R2 > 0.85. The slopes of the data-fitted line provide 
the rate constants, kobs, which are 0.76 min-1 (pH 4), 0.16 min-1 (pH 7) and 0.04 min-1 (pH 9). The 
As(V) removal tends to follow a pseudo first-order reaction because there are abundant active sites 
of NZVI in the beginning of reaction, and thus the As(V) species in solution can be adsorbed 
without sorptive competition. However, with increasing reaction time, the deviation from first-order 
kinetics was observed, obviously due to the loss of active surface sites. Based on Equation (2), the 
pseudo first-order reaction rate constant (k) and half-lives (t1/2), were calculated and presented in 
Table 1.

4.3 System characterization   
 
Based on the earlier study [12], it is understood that the As(V) removal is affected not only by pH 
but also by some other factors such as DO, surface area of NZVI, chemical composition of solution, 
 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS  
 
This study was conducted to investigate the effect of initial solution pH on As(V) removal by 
using NZVI as a media of sorption. The results reveal that acidic condition favors more in As 
removal than in base condition, due to electrostatic force between adsorbate and the adsorbent. The 
As sorption kinetics for all pH values studied follows closely a pseudo first-order reaction because 
of excess of sorption sites of NZVI in the initial time of reaction. The kinetic rate constant (k) for 
the pH 4 was around 4.7 and 18.8 times higher than those for the pH 7 and 9, respectively.

Abstract 
Nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) has been extensively researched for treatment of hazardous and toxic 
wastes. In particular, it can be applied to remediate contaminated sites directly. In this study, the 
NZVI was synthesized by using chemicals of NaBH4 and FeCl3. The conditions for NZVI synthesis 
were varied by these parameters such as air exposure, feeding rate of NaBH4 (3.3-10 mL/min), and 
agitation power (200-300 rpm). Right after completion of NZVI particles of different varieties, 
nitrate of 100 ppm was used to probe its reducing power. Of these three parameters investigated, it 
appears that the agitation of reaction solution plays a major role in determining its reducing power 
of NZVI particles. Besides, air exposure of reaction also posed noticeable change on the final 
residue of nitrate, whereas the synthesis with the studied range of NaBH4 feeding rate exhibited no 
significant effect on nitrate reduction.

2.3. Batch test 
The synthesized NZVI was applied immediately for its reducing power test using nitrate as a 
chemical probe. The test was carried out with probe concentration (C0) of 100 mg/L and 
NZVI dosage of 0.5 g/L. After the test, the reacted liquid samples were filtrated using a 
0.45µm membrane filter to remove the iron from solution. Then, the residual nitrate (C) was 
analyzed by using Ion Chromatography (DINNEX-120, USA).  
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of synthesizing parameters 
Air Exposure. In the presence of air, the oxygen may render the surface oxidation of 
produced NZVI during the synthesizing process (Reaction 3) [3]. In other words, the 
reducing power for the NZVI synthesized can be weakened because of the iron oxide layer 
blocking the electron transfer from the active sites of NZVI.  
 
2Fe0 + O2 + 2H2O  2Fe2+ + 4OH-                        (3) 
 
As shown in Figure 1, the nitrate was reduced by around 65% at time of 60 min under 
Condition C (air exposure), while the efficiency of nitrate reduction was 72% under 
Condition E (without air exposure). As understood, the sources of oxygen reacting with 
NZVI may come from atmospheric air and dissolved oxygen originally contained in the 
solution. In the case of solution-contained vessel sealed with aluminum foil, this can 
effectively prevent atmospheric oxygen from being absorbed into the reaction solution. 
Therefore, the nitrate-reduced capacity of NZVI can remain at a relatively higher level. 
Feeding rate of NaBH4. To avoid surface oxidation potential of NZVI being produced, it 
is preferred that the reaction can be completed as soon as possible. On top of this, it’s always 
beneficial to save the reaction time for NZVI synthesis. Figure 1 shows that the three feeding 
rates studied, 3.3, 6.6, and 10.0 mL/min, have no significant effect on the nitrate-reduced 
power when the agitation speeds were at 200 (Conditions A and B) and 300 rpm (Conditions 
D and E), respectively. Choi et al. (2008) reported that rapid feeding of NaBH4 may cause 
aggregation of NZVI precipitates, whereas slow feeding may result in oxidation of NZVI 
formed [6]. Comparatively speaking, it appears that the studied range of feeding rates, 3.3-
10.0 mL/min, imposes neither aggregation nor oxidation of NZVI particles in a significant 
way.

As shown in Figure 1, the total bed volume of reactor used 
in this study was 4.4 L. In addition, the treated liquid samples 
were filtrated by using a 0.45 µm membrane filter and the 
solution pH and ORP were measured by pH and ORP meter 
(Suntex TS1), while the dissolved oxygen was measured by 
DO meter (Oxi 330i). The residual arsenic (C) was determined 
by Inductively Coupled argon Plasma (ICP) using

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
A. Effect of gas bubbling scenario 
 
 
Effect of DO on arsenate removal performance comparison 
can be made between Scenario 1: oxic condition and Scenario 
3: anoxic condition.  As shown in Figure 2, the arsenate was 
removed under oxic condition more than anoxic condition. 
The reason is due to enhanced adsorption through 
oxygen-induced corrosion iron (hydr)oxide products [4, 9, 10].

Fig. 2 Comparison of arsenate removal under various gas 
bubbling conditions 
 
Effect of pH adjusted either by acid or by CO2 gas bubbling 
was investigated through Scenario 1 (H2SO4 addition) and 
Scenario 2 (CO2 bubbling). As shown in Figure 2, the one 
with H2SO4 adjustment has higher removal of arsenate than 
the one with CO2 bubbling. The key reason is the stripping of 
oxygen because of CO2
 
 bubbling. In Scenario 2, the resulted 
DO was near to zero (anoxic), while the DO remained 
relatively high in Scenario 1. As mentioned earlier, dissolved 
oxygen can promote the adsorption of arsenate. Without DO, 
Scenario 2 exhibits lower removal of arsenate though it’s in 
favorable acidic condition. 
In summary, the following conditions are desired to remove 
arsenate effectively: lower pH and higher DO. Based on this 
principle, Scenario 4 was designed to achieve the best removal 
of arsenate: CO2 bubbling plus air bubbling. The first bubbling 
is to ensure a favorable acidic environment, while the second 
bubbling is for increasing DO content in the solution to be 
treated. In so doing, the adverse water quality effect by acidic 
species H2SO4
 
 can be prevented. As a result, Figure 2 shows a 
profile for the Scenario 4 comparable to that for Scenario 1. The 
removal efficiency for Scenario 4 is more than 95% at time of 
25 min. 
B. Treated water characterization 
 
Based on the four mentioned scenarios, Figure 3 shows the 
three important profiles of pH, DO, and ORP. From Figure 
3(a), the initial pH of all scenarios were around 4; the pH’s 
with Scenarios 1 and 3 were adjusted by H2SO4 and Scenarios 
2 and 4 by  CO2 gas bubbling. All solution pH profiles were 
observed rise continuously throughout reaction period, due to 
the build-up of OH-
     
 as presented in Reactions (6) and (7) [11].

Based on the above, it appears that the arsenic can be 
better removed under acidic condition than under base 
condition. However, to adjust solution pH by using acidic 
species results in undesirable species, which will affect 
the treated water quality. According to the study earlier 
[17], the above issue of concern can be resolved by CO2 
bubbling, which can adjust the solution pH to acidic 
condition due to the hydrogen ions generated from 
carbonated water, as described in Reactions (1)-(4): 
  CO2(g) ↔ CO2(aq)               (1)  
CO2(aq) + H2O ↔ H2CO3    (2)   
H2CO3 ↔ HCO3- + H+          (3)  
HCO3- ↔ CO32- + H+             (4) 
In addition, it was reported that high amount of NZVI 
was required for arsenic removal in field groundwater 
[16], due to the competition between arsenic species and 
the background species of groundwater, or due to the 
inadequate amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) required for 
iron oxidation to enhance the process performance. With 
such understanding in mind, the air bubbling was 
employed and tested in the studied process. Thus, this 
paper focuses on the effect of gases bubbling on the 
arsenic removal rate by the NZVI, including CO2 and air. 
In addition, characterization of the NZVI behavior in 
solution was also performed for the treatment system 
design purpose. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHOD 
A. Materials 
The chemicals of reagent grade used in this study 
include FeCl3·6H2O (99%, Merck), and NaBH4 (> 96%; 
Merck). Both the As(III) and As(V) stock solution were 
prepared from NaAsO2 (Fluka) and Na2HAsO4·7H2O (J.T. 
Baker), respectively. The H2SO4 and NaOH were used for 
adjusting the initial solution pH. All chemical solutions 
were prepared with deionized water (18.2 MΩ Mill-Q). 
Gases of CO2 (99.5%), Air (O2 21%, N2 79%), and N2 
(99.99%) used in this study were purchased from a local 
supplier (Tainan, Taiwan).  
B.  NZVI synthesis 
The NZVI was synthesized according to Glavee et al. 
(1995) [14]. A liquid volume of 40 mL of 0.25 M NaBH4 
were
 
added into 40 mL of 0.045 M FeCl3 aqueous 
solution to form nanoiron particles. The mixture was 
agitated by a revolving propeller. The reaction for NZVI 
formation is shown in Reaction (5).  
Fe(H2O)63+ + 3BH4- + 3H2OFe0 + 3B(OH)3 +10.5H2 (5) 
The NZVI particles formed were separated from the 
liquid solution using a magnet. Immediately, it was then 
used in the treatment system.  
C.  Reaction system 
The NZVI was used in the arsenic treatment system 
right after it was synthesized. A dosage of 0.023 g/L of 
NZVI was applied throughout all experiments. As 
described in earlier study [18], the reactor with liquid 
volume of 4.4 L was designed to combine the two 
chambers for both reactants reaction and particles settling 
in one unit. The external-circulating pump was installed at 
outlet of the reactor to form a recirculation mode for 
arsenic removal (see Figure 1). The solution pH was 
measured by pH meter (Suntex TS1), while the DO was 
measured by DO meter (Oxi 330i). The total arsenic, 
(As(V) and As(III)), was determined by inductively 
coupled argon plasma (ICP) using Thermo Scientific 
Model iCAP 6000 series (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Internal recirculated pump; 3. External recirculated pump; 4. CO2 tank; 5. 
Air tank; 6. N2 tank 
D.  Batch experiments 
The initial arsenic concentration applied was 1000 
µg/L for all experiments studied, while the initial solution 
pH’s were 4.0, 7.0 and 9.0. To reveal the role of DO in 
the reaction solution, experiments were designed to 
explore arsenic removal under deoxygenated and 
oxygenated conditions. Prior to reaction, the solution was 
bubbled with N2 gas for 30 min to strip out dissolved 
oxygen from the solution until the DO level was less than 
0.5 mg/L, a deoxygenated condition.  
In the part of gas bubbling, several sets of experiments 
were designed to optimize the process performance for 
arsenic removal. Three various gas-bubbled scenarios 
were proposed and tested. The details were further 
explained in Table 1. In Scenario 1, the initial solution pH 
was controlled within neutral range, and the system was 
then treated by continuous CO2 bubbling to create a 
favorable acidic condition. In Scenario 2, the solution was 
initially acidified by CO2 bubbling, and then followed by 
its treatment without any gas bubbling. In Scenario 3, the 
solution was bubbled in sequence by CO2 gas and by air 
to create a low pH and high DO condition, and it was then 
treated by continuous air aeration. 
 
arsenic concentration for As(III), and it was around 40% 
for As(V). If compared to the two arsenic profiles of 
solution pH 4 in Figure 2, where the pH was adjusted by 
H2SO4, Scenario 2 shows a lower performance of arsenic 
removal. The key reason behind such difference was its 
lack of dissolved oxygen, due to the stripping by CO2 gas 
bubbling. As can be seen from Figure 3, the initial DO (1-
2 mg/L) was low for Scenario 2, after CO2 bubbling. A 
low DO level will slow the rate of iron oxidation, 
resulting in the decrease of arsenic removal. 
Based on the above results, Scenario 3 was further 
proposed to verify the most favorable condition for 
arsenic removal, i.e., lower pH and higher DO condition. 
As shown in Figure 3, the pH and DO profiles for 
Scenario 3 demonstrate that both acidic environment and 
high initial DO has been obtained. In addition, the 
removal efficiency of As(V) was higher than that of 
As(III). The As(III) concentration decreased gradually 
over the later reaction period, with the final concentration 
around 20% of the initial arsenic concentration, whereas 
the As(V) was rapidly removed and reached to its 
equilibrium concentration at 10 min. Such results indicate 
that Scenario 3 is recommended to achieve a satisfactory 
removal of As(V), without addition of any acidic species. 
On the other hand, it will take much more reaction time to 
remove As(III) to achieve the same degree of removal as 
As(V). Preoxidation of As(III) can be considered when 
Scenario 3 is applied.

arsenic concentration = 1000 ppb; NZVI dosage = 0.023 g/L.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
This study was conducted to investigate performance 
of NZVI in removing arsenic from aqueous solutions. 
Different parameters such as initial solution pH and DO 
were studied for their effects on arsenic removal. It was 
observed that arsenic can be removed favorably under 
acid condition and high DO level. To avoid the use of 
acidic species, which may deteriorate the water quality, 
different gas bubbling scenarios was investigated. 
Consequently, pretreatment by CO2 and air bubbling in 
sequence is recommended for satisfactory performance of

including (1) physicochemical adsorption and (2) oxidation and reduction reaction [6]. Contaminants 
removed by ZVI include halogenated hydrocarbons such as TCE, PCE, anions (e.g. NO3-, Cr2O73-), heavy 
metal, arsenic, and organic compound [7-11]. However, the problems associated with the use of micro-scale 
ZVI (MZVI) are that the reaction time required is in days, and a considerable amount of iron is needed for 
complete removal of target compounds [10, 12]. This serves to address the need of more efficient nano-scale 
ZVI (NZVI) synthesis development. 
Currently, the NZVI has received widespread attention from field researchers for groundwater 
treatment because of its extremely small particle size, large surface area, high in situ reactivity, and high 
mobility in groundwater [13]. There were many techniques and methods for NZVI synthesis such as 
chemical method [7, 14], sono-chemical method [15], and thermal decomposition [16]. The sono-chemical 
method will generate toxic by-product, CO, because this method uses Fe(CO)5 as a raw material [17]. As for 
the thermal decomposition method, the produced NZVI particles tend to aggregate, due to the loss of the 
stabilization ability caused by the disappearance of the initial reactant chemicals during the heating process 
[16].  
Since the NZVI has high reactivity with oxygen and water, inappropriate conditions for synthesis 
may result in the decrease of reducing capacity of NZVI synthesized. Thus, the goal of this study was to 
investigate the effect of parameters such as air exposure, pumping rate of reagents, and agitation speed of 
mixing on the reducing power of NZVI particles. The NZVI was synthesized by using the chemical method 
because of its ease and simplicity. In addition, there’s no need for complicated equipment or instrument for 
synthesis. In view of the best conditions for NZVI synthesis, one may characterize NZVI synthesized by 
specific surface area, particle size, and solution pH of zero point charge. However, all these are time and cost 
consuming. In this study, the produced NZVI particles were tested for their reducing potential by using 
nitrate (NO3-) as the chemical probe. Several studies reported that the final products of NO3- reduction by 
ZVI were nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), or nitrogen (N2), depending on the reaction conditions [18-21]. 
Possible reactions of NO3- reduction by ZVI were listed in Reactions (1)-(4).

In order to evaluate the impact of parameters for synthesis, experiments were designed by using two-
level factorial design (FD). Note that the FD, widely and commonly adopted in industry, is an efficient tool 
 
 
 
Two-level FD was employed to evaluate the impact of parameters on the reducing capacity of NZVI 
synthesized in this study. A full factorial design involves runs of 2k different experimental conditions, which 
represent all combinations of the k factors at high and low levels [22]. Note that the “k” is independent 
variables investigated. In this study, three factors were investigated for their effects on NZVI synthesis, 
including pumping rate of NaBH4, agitation speed, and air exposure. Thus, the total experiments to be 
performed will be 8 runs (=23). The design matrix for experiment is depicted in Table 1.

The profiles of NO3- reduction by NZVI under various conditions were shown in Figure 3(a). It 
appears that higher nitrate removal was found in Run #5, with the level of (-), (+), and (+) for A, B, and C, 
respectively. In contrast, Run #7, which involves A(+), B(-) and C(-), give lower efficiency of NO3- 
reduction. Thus, it is possible that the condition of low pumping rate of NaBH4, high agitation speed and no 
air exposure is favorable for increasing reducing capacity of the NZVI synthesized.  
Based on Reaction (3), the electron donating capacity (EDC, mole electrons per unit mass of NZVI) 
is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of NZVI’s reducing power of different types. The EDC can be 
expressed by Equations (8)-(9).

The EDC’s for NZVI synthesized under different conditions (see Table 1) were thus calculated by 
following Equation (9) and presented in Figure 3(b). In summary, the reducing power for different types of 
NZVI is in the following order: Run #5 >= 1 > 6 >= 8 > 4 > 2 > 3 > 7. 
 
Estimates of effects of interaction factors 
The estimate of effect for each of the factors shown in Figure 4 is the difference between the average 
response of high level (+) and the average response of low level (-) of that factor in design matrix of Table 1 
[25]. Note that the data for average response calculation were taken from those plotted in Figure 2(b). As 
shown in Figure 4(a), the negative estimate of main effect of A (pumping rate of NaBH4) was -0.77, 
implying that this main factor play a negative role in regard to the reducing capacity of NZVI. For example, 
increasing pumping rate of NaBH4 from 4 to 8 mL/min results in the decrease of EDC by 0.77 mmol e-
/gNZVI. On the other hand, the positive estimates of effects of main factors B (agitation speed) and C (air 
exposure) were 2.84 and 0.07, respectively; this indicates that these two main factors play a positive role, 
with the former one to a much greater degree. The effect of interaction factor was considered because of its 
large estimate of effect, especially in the cases of AB and AC, as illustrated in Figure 4(a). Hence, the two-
factor interaction plots is further illustrated in Figure 4(b), in terms of the EDC.  
 
 
 
 
hand, keeping the pumping rate of NaBH4 either at high or low level, the EDC value changes slightly when 
the reaction condition varies from the one without air exposure to another with air exposure (4.7 to 4.5 mmol 
e-/gNZVI for the low pumping rate, and 4.0 to 4.2 mmol e-/gNZVI for the high pumping rate). In the case of 
interaction factor BC, the EDC remains rather unchanged whether the reaction is exposed to air or not, when 
keeping the agitation speed either at high or low level. But, the change of the agitation speed from high to 
low level results in significant drop of EDC for both conditions of without and with air exposure. Based on 
the above interaction analysis, among the parameters studied, the reducing power of NZVI is influenced by 
the following order: the agitation speed > the pumping rate of NaBH4 > air exposure. Such results can also 
be observed from Figure 4(a).    
 
Conceptual interpretation   
Agitation speed. Two different agitating speeds, 100 and 300 rpm, were investigated in this study. 
The purpose was to compare the degree of NZVI particle aggregation. According to Figure 4(a), the higher 
the agitating speed, the higher the reducing power of NZVI particles. As may be explained in Figure 5(a), 
higher agitating speed results in more dispersion of NZVI particles, which in turn provides higher area 
contact between NZVI and nitrate.

Figure 5.  Conceptual behavior of NZVI synthesized under various conditions 
 
Pumping rate of NaBH4. To avoid surface oxidation potential of NZVI being produced, it is preferred 
that the reaction can be completed as soon as possible. On top of this, it’s always beneficial to save the 
reaction time for NZVI synthesis. Of the two feeding rates studied, 4 and 8 mL/min, lower reducing power 
was observed when higher feeding rate was applied. Choi et al. (2008) reported that rapid feeding of NaBH4 
causes aggregation of NZVI precipitates (Figure 5(a)), whereas slow feeding results in oxidation of NZVI 
produced [17].
