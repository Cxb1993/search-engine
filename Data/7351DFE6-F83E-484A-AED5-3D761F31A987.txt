Speciation of titanium in the TiO2/Fe3O4@C during photocatalytic degradation of TCE (100 ppm) 
has also been studied by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structural (XANES) spectroscopy. 
TiO2 is not perturbed during the course of photocatalysis. Nevertheless, about 33% of FeO and 
67% of Fe3O4 are observed under photocatalytic degradation of TCE for 120 min, suggesting that 
the carbon layer on the TiO2/Fe3O4@C photocatalysts can reduce the process of photoexcited 
electron-hole recombination as frequently found on the relatively narrow bandgap of ferric oxide 
during photocatalysis.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) are extremely persistent in the 
environment. Of which, trichloroethylene (TCE) and CHCl3 are chosen as the probe molecules 
because they are associated with a wide range of industrial processes and are great environmental 
concern. In addition, TCE is frequently found in the groundwater at many gas station and 
industrial contaminated sites [1,2]. TCE is one of the dense non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs) 
because of its high density, weak adsorption to soils, and low water solubility resulting in a 
difficult-to-treat problem for contaminated groundwater. 
TiO2 and ZnO being environmental friendly and high chemical and mechanical stability are 
very effective in photocatalysis processes. In the recent decade, the enlargement of 
surface-to-volume ratios of nanoparticles have gained significant attention especially in 
two-dimensional films, quantum well and dots [3,4]. Nanostructures may have an enhanced 
photocatalytic reactivity because of quantum size effect and enlargement of surface-to-volume 
ratios [5,6]. Nanosize ZnO and TiO2 have attracted great research interests and applications such 
as optoelectronics, sensing, field emission and piezoelectric devices. 
Many methods for preparing nanostructure such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 
physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrodeposition and sol-gel have been reported [7-11]. The 
sol-gel method has many advantages including relatively homogeneous composition, easy control 
of length and thickness and nanostructure of the synthesized thin films and particles. Hermanson 
and coworkers found that microwires could be formed by collection of metallic nanoparticles 
suspensed in a colloidal solution with dielectrophoresis [12]. The controlled length and thickness 
TiO2 nanowire photocatalysts enhanced photodegradation of toxic organic compounds. However, 
speciation of thin films during sensing and nanowires during photocatalysis are still lacking in the 
literature. By synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray 
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies, reaction mechanisms between the thin films 
and nanowires with toxic Cl-VOCs may be revealed.  Thus, the main objectives were to 
investigate sensitivity (Rair/RCHCl3) and photocatalysis of the ZnO thin films and novel reticular

2. EXPERIMENTAL 
2.1 Experimental Design 
Although thin films have been widely used in various gases, but speciation of thin films 
during sensing and nanowires during photocatalysis are still lacking in the literature.  Thus, the 
main objectives of present work were included: Synthesis of ZnO nanorods thin films; 
Determination of sensitivity and photocatalysis of the ZnO nanorods thin films with Cl-VOCs 
(such as TCE and CHCl3); Synthesis of TiO2 magnetic photocatalyst; Determination of 
photocatalysis of the reticular TiO2 nanowires with TCE; Speciation studies of Zn, Ti and Fe in 
the ZnO nanorods thin films and TiO2 magnetic photocatalyst. 
The scope of the present work about ZnO nanorods thin films and novel reticular TiO2 
nanowires are summarized in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2, respectively.  Structure and chemical 
information of the ZnO nanorods thin films and novel reticular TiO2 nanowires were investigated 
by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray 
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device Vibrating 
Sample Magnetometer (SQUID VSM).  Reaction paths of the thin films during sensing and 
nanowires during photocatalysis have also be investigated by in-situ XANES and EXAFS 
spectroscopy.

2.1 Preparation of ZnO nanorod thin films 
    ZnO seeds were deposited onto a glass substrate by the dip-coating method. [13]  Briefly, a 
clean glass was dipped into a mixture solution containing 1.93 g of zinc acetate dihydrate 
(Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) (MERCK), 24.5 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2) (MERCK), and 0.5 
mL of monoethanolamine (C2H7NO,MEA) (WAKO) at 338 K for 40 min, and pulled out the 
glass from the mixture solution in a slow rate of 1.2 cm/min. The ZnO seed thin film was 
calcined at 573 K for 15 min (which was reiterated five times) and calcined at 823 K for 90 min.  
The ZnO nanorod arrays were synthesized by the wet-chemical method [14]. In a similar 
procedure, the ZnO nanorods were prepared with a mixture solution containing (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) 
(Kanto Chemical) and hexamethylenetetramine ((CH2)6N4) (MERCK) in deionized water at 363 
K for eight h. 
2.2 Preparation of TiO2 magnetic photocatalyst 
Preparation of Fe3O4@C core-shell nanoparticles - The Fe3O4 encapsulated in carbon 
(Fe3O4@C) core-shell nanoparticles were sunthesized by a hydrothermal method [15]. Briefly, a 
solution containing 3.4 g of sucrose (C12H22O11) (Baker), 0.94 g of FeCl3 (Alfa Aesar), 6.0 g of 
urea (CO(NH2)2) (Riedel-de) and 40 mL of deionized water, which was hydrothermally treated at 
453 for 14 hours. The precipitates were filtered, washed with ethanol several times, and dried at 
333 K for eight hours 
Preparation of TiO2 magnetic photocatalysts - The Fe3O4@C nanoparticles was dispersed in a 
solution of deionized water-ethanol (3:7), in which a ethanol solution contained Ti(OC3H7)4 
(1.2mL) was slowly added with stirring (300 rpm) for 20 hours. The magnetic photocatalyst were 
separated by centrifuging, washed with ethanol several times, dried at 333 K for four hours and 
calcined at 723 K in anaerobic and aerobic condition, respectively.

2.6 In-situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy  
  The in-situ XANES and EXAFS cell for magnetic photocatalyst during photoatalysis is shown 
in Figure 2. In situ XANES and EXAFS spectra of samples and model compounds were recorded 
on the Wiggler beamline (BL17C) at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center 
(NSRRC). The electron storage ring was operated at energy of 1.5 GeV. A Si (III) double-crystal 
monochromator was used for selection of energy. The energy resolution △E/E of the beamline 
was about 1.9 × 10-4 (eV/eV). Data were collected in fluorescence mode with a Lytle detector. 
The photon energy was calibrated by characteristic preedge peaks in the absorption of Zn-foil, 
Ti-foil and Fe-foil (9659, 4966 and 7112 eV). Figure 3 shows a schematic illustration for typical 
X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements. 
   The EXAFS data were analyzed using the UWXAFS 3.0 [16] and FEFF 7.0 simulation 
programs [17].  The raw absorption data in the region of 50-200 eV below the edge position 
were fitted to a straight line by the least-square algorithms. The EXAFS data was normalized to 
the edge jump and converted to the wavenumber scale. Fourier transformation of the scattering 
curve yielded a radial structure function (RSF). The Fourier transform was performed on 
K3-weighted EXAFS oscillations in the range of 3.1-11.1 Å-1. 
  The near-edge structure in an absorption spectrum includes the range between the threshold 
and the point at which the EXAFS begins. The XANES spectra extend to energy of 50 eV above 
the edge. XANES spectroscopy can combine with principal component analysis (PCA) and 
least-squares fitting (LSF) as a quantitatively analytical tool for speciation of dilute and/or 
amorphous multicomponents, which is not easily attainable with conventional methods. 
Semi-quantitative analyses of the edge spectra were conducted by the least-square fitting of linear 
combinations of standard spectra to the spectrum of the samples.

Figure 5 SEM images of the ZnO nanorods 
The in situ FT-IR spectra of TCE and gaseous products during photocatalytic degradation of 
TCE on the ZnO nanorods are shown in Figure 6. The C–H bending of TCE is decreased as the 
absorbance of CO2 is increased, the gaseous products such as dichloroacetyl chloride (DCAC) 
and phosgene was also found during photocatalysis. 
At the initial stage of the photocatalysis reaction, the photoactive species (OH•) formed on the 
ZnO nanorods under UV irradiation may be attributed to the effectively photocatalytic 
dechlorination.  The intermediate dichloroacetyl chloride yielded during photocatalytic 
degradation of TCE has also been observed. 
It seems that absorption of phosgene is increased with oxidation of DCAC. DCAC and 
phosgene was decreased and eventually oxidized to CO2 and HCl. Prolonging the UV irradiation 
to 300 min, about 40% of TCE can be mineralized.

Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence on resistance variances of the ZnO seeds and 
nanorods during sensing of CHCl3. The sensitivities of the ZnO seed layer and nanorod thin films, 
in the presence of 1000 ppm of CHCl3 at 300-573 K, are also shown in Figure 10. It is clear that 
the ZnO nanorods have a much higher sensitivity than the ZnO seed layer. Note that the 
sensitivity of the ZnO nanorods increases as the reaction temperature increases. For instance, at 
573 K, the sensitivity of ZnO nanorods thin films is 13 compared to ZnO seed layer at 300 K.

suggesting that Fe3O4 may be encapsulated within carbon layer. The C 1s spectrum of the 
TiO2/Fe2O3 shows that an incomplete oxidation of the carbon layer may occur. .

Figure 15 shows photocatalytic degradation of TCE (100 ppm) under UV/VIS light radiation 
on nanosize TiO2 (P25), TiO2/Fe3O4@C, and TiO2/Fe2O3 photocatalysts. In the absence of 
photocatalysts, about 14% of TCE can be degraded under UV/VIS light radiation for 10 h. With 
the nanosize TiO2, TiO2/Fe3O4@C, and TiO2/Fe2O3, about 50, 57, and 55% of TCE, respectively 
can be photocatalytically degraded in the absence of an external magnetic field. The magnetic 
materials (such as Fe3O4 and Fe2O3) may cause a less photocatalytic reactivity since an increase 
of the electron-hole recombination on the narrow bandgap of ferric oxides may occur [18,19].

Figure 18 XPS spectra of (a) Fe3O4@C and (b) TiO2/Fe3O4@C. 
To better understand chemical structure of titanium species in the TiO2/Fe3O4@C 
nanoparticles, their XANES spectra were determined. The Ti K-edge least-square fitted XANES 
spectrum of the TiO2/Fe3O4@C is shown in Figure 19. About 77% of nanosize TiO2 (9 nm) and 
23% of bulky TiO2 are found in the TiO2/Fe3O4@C photocatalyst.

transition that indicates the valence of Fe species as Fe2+ and Fe3+ can be observed at 7128 eV 
and 7134 eV, respectively. After UV/VIS irradiation to 120 min in photocatalysis, the main peak 
of the TiO2/Fe3O4@C are shifted (from 7132) to 7130.7 eV, suggesting that the photoexcited 
electrons are transferred from TiO2 to iron during the photocatalytic degradation of TCE.

photocatalytic degradation of 100 ppm TCE for (a) 0, (b) 30, (c) 60, (d) 90 and (e) 
120 min. 
In Figure 22, XANES spectra of iron were fitted with spectra of model compounds such as 
Fe3O4 and FeO. In the separate experiments, the TiO2/Fe3O4@C possessing a higher 
photoreactivity than the TiO2/Fe3O4. It seems that TiO2 on magnetic materials (such as Fe3O4 and 
Fe2O3) may have a relatively less photoactivity possibly due to the fact that the rapid 
photoexcited electron-hole recombination may occur on ferric oxides with a narrow bandgap.  
THE least-square components fitted XANES spectra show that about 33% of the iron species are 
reduced (Fe3O4 to FeO) during photocatalytic degradation of TCE for 120 min.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
Sensing and photocatalysis of Cl-VOCs on ZnO nanorods thin films and reticular TiO2 
nanowires has been studied in the present work. Conclusions of the experimental observations are 
summarized as follows: 
(1)  The ZnO nanorods have a hexagonal structure packed closely with a diameter of about 150 
nm and a length of 2500 nm. XRD patterns of the ZnO nanorod thin films illustrate a 
preferred c-axis orientation of ZnO nanorods (002), suggesting the existence of well-aligned 
ZnO nanorod arrays. 
(2)  The ZnO nanorods have a much higher sensitivity than the ZnO seed layer. The sensitivity 
of the ZnO nanorods increases as the reaction temperature increases. At 573 K, the 
sensitivity of ZnO nanorods thin films is 13 approximately 
(3)  The EXAFS data shows that as CHCl3 is introduced onto the ZnOnanorods thin film, the 
bond distance of
 
Zn-O is decreased slightly from 1.962 to 1.961 Å. 
(4)  Prolong the UV irradiation to 300 min, about 40% of TCE can be photocatalytically 
degraded on the ZnO nanorods thin film. The intermediate dichloroacetyl chloride yielded 
during photocatalytic degradation of TCE has also been observed and eventually is oxidized 
to CO2 and HCl. 
(5)  SEM and VSM show that Fe and Ti are well dispersed and assembled in solution under an 
external magnetic field. 
(6)  Prolong the UV irradiation to 10 hour, about 57% and 55% of TCE can be 
photocatalytically degraded by TiO2/Fe3O4@C and TiO2/Fe2O3 without an external 
magnetic field. 
(7)  Under 250 Gauss magnetic field, a 70% conversion for photocatalytic degradation of TCE 
on TiO2/Fe3O4@C has been found. 
(8)  By XANES, about 77% of nanosize (9 nm) and 23% of bulk state TiO2 are found in

cover the sea surface, consequently, long-term interrupt the marine environment (Wei et 
al., 2003). Thus, fast collects of spill oils with skimmers and entraps of those oils with 
scavengers by adsorbents are used frequently as the general response to major spill oil 
accidents (Annunciado et al., 2005). However, effective engineering methods for 
clean-up the spill oil contaminated levee are still lacking. 
Titanium nanotubes (TNTs) having high surface area, chemical stability under alkali 
or acidic conditions, and sunlight sensitized have been employed for potential 
applications such as wastewater treatment (Doong and Chiang, 2008; Ling and Lo, 
2008), photocatalysis (Nian et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 2008; Kubo et al., 2009), 
photo-induced reactions (Tokudome and Miyauchi, 2004), and photo-sensitized 
electrodes (Adachi et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2006). The oriented N-TNT thin films 
prepared using templates of the ZnO nanorod arrays can effectively degrade spill oils 
under visible light illumination (Hsu et al., 2008). 
To improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the TNT, metal promoters have generally 
been dispersed on photocatalysts. Nian and coworkers (2006) have demonstrated that 
the copper dispersed TNT (40% Cu2+) could enhance NO reduction. Kubo et al. (2009) 
also suggested that degradation of 2-propanol could be effectively photocatalyzed by a 
platinum-loaded TNT under UV radiation. To design an effective photocatalyst for 
degradation of spill oils contaminated on the levee, molecule-scale data (such as local 
bonding environment and oxidation state of the photoactive sites) which can be 
obtained by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption 
near edge structure (XANES) are essential. By component-fitted XANES, the observed 
catalytic active species such as copper oxide clusters in the channels of ZSM-5 played 
an important role in catalytic decomposition of heptane or toluene (Tsai et al., 2008). 
Hsiung and coworkers (2008) have found by XANES that the photoactive species (A2)

(NanoTek®, Kanto Chemical), TNT, Cu-TNT, and Fe-TNT were measured on a diffuse 
reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (Cary 100 Conc, Varian). 
Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the nanosize TiO2, TNT, Cu-TNT, and 
Fe-TNT were studied on a surface area analyzer (COULTER SA3100, Beckman) and 
their pore size distributions were also obtained by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller 
calculation. 
Photocatalytic degradation of MB effected by the nanosize TiO2, TNT, Cu-TNT, or 
Fe-TNT was performed on a home-made photoreactor (Liu and Wang, 2002). 0.01 g of 
the nanosize TiO2, TNT, Cu-TNT, or Fe-TNT photocatalyst was suspended in a MB (20 
mg·L-1) aqueous solution (50 mL) with magnetic stirring and cooling water circulation 
(Medel-B401D, Firstek Scientific). The photocatalysts suspended MB solution was well 
stirred in the dark for 1 h prior to the photocatalytic experiments. A 300 W Xenon lamp 
solar simulator (No. 91160A, Newport) combined with an AM 1.5 G filter (No. 59044, 
Oriel) was served as the light source. The power density of the irradiation was fixed at 
100 mW·cm-1 by use of a reference solar cell and meter (No. 91150, Oriel). The 
concentration of the MB was measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 100 Conc, 
Varian) at the maximum absorbance of 662 nm. 
The EXAFS and XANES spectra of the TNT, Cu-TNT, and Fe-TNT photocatalysts 
were collected on the Wiggler beam line at the Taiwan National Synchrotron Radiation 
Research Center. The storage ring was operated at the energy of 1.5 GeV. A Si(111) 
double-crystal monochromator was used for beam energy selection at the energy 
resolution (ΔE/E) of 1.9×10-4. The beam energy was calibrated by the use of the 
maximum absorption edge of Ti, Cu, and Fe foils at 4966, 8979, and 7112 eV,

As the Cu- and Fe-TNTs have visible light absorption capacities, their photocatalytic 
performances were studied with an evaluation test of photocatalytic degradation of MB 
on a solar simulator. Figure 4 shows photocatalytic degradation of MB effected by the 
TNT, Cu-TNT, and Fe-TNT. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of the nanosize 
TiO2 was also determined. It seems that the nanosize TiO2, TNT, and Cu-TNT are not 
very active in photocatalytic degradation of MB (<14%) under sunlight illumination for 
240 min, while notably the Fe-TNT possesses a greater MB degradation efficiency 
(57%). 
To better understand nature of the photocatalytic sites on the TNT, Cu-TNT, and 
Fe-TNT, their XANES and EXAFS spectra of the Ti, Cu, and Fe K-edges were 
measured. Figure 5 shows the Ti K-edge XANES spectra of the TNT, Cu-TNT, and 
Fe-TNT. It is found that the dispersed Cu and Fe have little perturbation on distribution 
of the A1, A2, and A3 species for the TNTs, which may be associated with the 
tetrahedral (TiO4), square pyramid ((Ti=O)O4), and octahedral (TiO6) titanium oxide
structures, respectively within the pre-edge of 4963-4973 eV (Hsiung et al., 2008; 
Farges et al., 1997). Note that the A2 species which may account for the photoac
sites are predominant (51-54%) on the TNT, Cu-TNT, and F
Figure 6 shows the Cu and Fe K-edges XANES spectra of the Cu-TNT, Fe-TNT and 
model compounds (Cu, Cu2O, CuO, Fe, FeO, and Fe2O3). In the copper and iron 
XANES spectra at 8977-8987 and 7111-7125 eV, the 1s-to-4p and 1s-to-3d transitions 
are observed, respectively (Groothaert et al., 2003; Nilsen et al., 2007). Note that Cu(II) 
and Fe(0)/Fe(III) are the main copper and iron species on the Cu-TNT and Fe-TNT 
photocatalysts, respectively. It is very likely that the enhanced photocatalytic

Synchrotron Radiation Center. The electron storage ring was
manipulated at energy of 1.5GeV and current of 100–200mA. The
beam energy was calibrated with a copper foil at energy of
8979eV. An Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator was used for
selection of energy with an energy resolution (DE/E) of 1.9104
(eV/eV). The X-ray absorption data were analyzed using the
UWAXFS 3.0 and FEFF 7.0 simulated programs [8]. The ﬁtted pre-
edged background was extrapolated throughout the data range,
and subtracted and normalized to decline the effect of sample
thickness. The Fourier transform was performed on k3-weighted
EXAFS oscillation in the range 3.0–11.2 A˚

.
Six grams of nanosize TiO2 (P25) were mixed with a solution
containing 0.1mL of Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2mL of
acetylacetone (Fluka) and 10mL of deionized water to yield a TiO2
paste. Three drops of the TiO2 paste was spread on a Scotch magic
tape (3M) masked ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide substrate (8O/square,
Solaronix SA) (2.5 cm2.5 cm) by the doctor-blade method. The
as-coated glass was dried and scratched out for a working area of
0.25 cm2 followed by being pre-heated at 323K for 15min and
calcined at 723K for 30min. The TiO2-coated glass was immersed
in a 3104M of N3 (cis-di(thiocyanate) bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4’-
dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II), ruthenium 535, Solaronix SA)
anhydrous ethanol solution for 24h in the dark. The counter
electrode was prepared by distribution of three drops of
H2PtCl6 6H2O (Alfa Aesar) on the conducting tin oxide electrode
(10O/square, Ritek) with a spin-coater (SP-M1-S, APISC) at
1500 rpm for 15 s. The electrode was pre-heated at 323K for
15min and calcined at 658K for 10min. The photo- and counter-
electrodes were sandwiched together with a 0.06-mm-thick hot-
melt thermal foil (SO-SX1170, Solaronix SA) as a spacer. The Cu@C
dispersed electrolyte was introduced into the cell and sealed with
AB epoxy that was cured for 30min. A 300W xenon arc lamp solar
simulator (#91160A, Oriel) conjugated with the AM 1.5 Globe
ﬁlter (#59044, Oriel) was employed to measure the I–V char-
acteristics of the quasi-solid-state DSSC. The illumination was
ﬁxed at 100mW/cm2 using a reference solar cell and meter
(#91150, Oriel).
3. Results and discussion
In Fig. 1, the TEM images show that the Cu@C nanoparticles
have Cu diameters of about 7 and 18nm. The nanoparticles
possessing nearly spherical in shape are uniformly dispersed and
isolated individually. The core Cu encapsulated in the carbon shell
has the thicknesses ranged from 3 to 5nm. The XRD patterns of
the Cu@C nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2. The presence of the
amorphous carbon is characterized by the broadened band at
10–401. The diameters of Cu determined using the full-width at
half-maximum by the Sherrer equation [7] are 7 and 18nm,
which is consistent with the observation of their TEM images.
Fig. 3 illustrates the XANES spectra of copper in the Cu@C
dispersed RTILs. In the pre-edge XANES spectra of copper, a
shoulder at 8984–8988eV and an intense band at 8995–9002eV
are observed, indicating the existence of Cu(II) species. The Cu@C
nanoparticles dispersed in the [bmim][BF4] or [bmim][PF6]
contain mainly nanosize Cu (92–94%) and a small amount of
Cu2O and CuO. About 7% of Cu in the Cu@C (Cu diameter=7nm)
may involve in dissolution and oxidation and form CuO and Cu2O
in the [bmim][PF6]. However, for the large Cu@C nanoparticles
(Cu diameter=18nm), formation of high-oxidation state copper is
relatively less than that in the case of the smaller Cu (7nm) in the
Cu@C. In a separate work, it was found that the [bmim] cations in
the RTIL may interact very little with the dispersed Cu@C
nanoparticles [4]. The larger counter anion ([PF
6
]) may, on the
contrary, play an important role in trapping the smaller Cu@C.
In the absence of solar energy, the Cu@C dispersed RTILs have
higher electrical conductivities than the plain RTIL by 8–15%
(Table 1). Interestingly, under the UV/Vis radiation, oxidation/
dissolution of Cu (Cu-Cu2+ +2e) in the Cu@C dispersed
