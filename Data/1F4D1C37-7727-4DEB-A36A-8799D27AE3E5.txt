Abstract 
1. Synthesis of Highly Active Ag/Pd Nanorings for Activating Electroless Copper Deposition 
    A new and simple method for preparing Ag/Pd nanorings is reported. Energy-dispersive X-ray element 
mapping results showed a random distribution of Ag and Pd atoms over the nanoring, indicating that the 
nanorings were made of an alloy of Ag and Pd. These nanorings were then successfully used as catalysts in 
electroless copper deposition. Results of quartz crystal microbalance measurements revealed that the catalytic 
activity of prepared Ag/Pd nanorings was better than that of monometallic Ag and Pd nanoparticles. 
 
2. Porous Ag-Pd Triangle Nanoplates with Tunable Alloy Ratio for Catalyzing Electroless Copper  
Deposition 
  Porous triangular Ag-Pd nanoplates of various bimetallic ratios were prepared by a galvanic 
displacement reaction in which Pd(OAc)2 reacted with Ag nanoplates. In order to reduce the interaction of 
free hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with the synthesized Ag-Pd nanoplates during this 
reaction, Ag nanoplate/CTAB solution was precipitated by high-speed centrifugation before synthesizing 
the porous bimetallic nanotemplates. The kinetics of electroless copper deposition (ECD) catalyzed by 
these bimetallic nanoplates are analyzed by using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The results reveal 
that Ag18Pd1 nanoplates show better catalytic activity than Ag18Pd1.5 and Ag18Pd2 nanoplates. Further, the 
catalytic activity of the porous nanoplates in the ECD bath can be controlled by varying their alloy ratios.  
 
3. Electrochemical synthesis of Pd–NiO nanoparticles in water-in-oil microemulsions for activating 
electroless Ni deposition 
Dispersions of Pd–NiO nanoparticles were electrochemically synthesized in a water-in-oil microemulsion, 
with fine control by appropriate adjustment of the concentration ratio of H2O to surfactant. The feasibility 
of using these Pd–NiO nanoparticles as a new activator for electroless Ni deposition (END) was examined. 
In this study, fast electroless deposition was achieved using Pd–NiO nanoparticles as a catalyst. A 
systematic study of the deposition kinetics and the mass activity by electrochemical quartz-crystal 
microgravimetry indicated that adding NiO to active colloids can shorten the induction time, and that 
reducing the particle diameter can accelerate END reactions because steady-state deposition is achieved 
more quickly.

1.  Synthesis of Highly Active Ag/Pd Nanorings for Activating Electroless Copper 
Deposition 
 
1.1  Introduction 
Metallic nanoparticles of different shapes have the potential to be used as catalysts in organic 1-3 and 
electrochemical reactions 1,4. For example, Pt nanoparticles of various shapes (size: 5 nm) are used as 
catalysts in the electron-transfer reactions between [Fe(CN)6]3– and S2O32– 5. Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) analysis shows that the percentage of atoms located at the corners and edges in 
tetrahedral, cubic, and truncated octahedral Pt nanocrystal are approximately 35%, 13%, and 6% of the total 
number of surface atoms, respectively. The catalytic rate constants increase exponentially with the 
percentage of corner and edge atoms 5. The other reaction involved shape-dependent catalysis is 
hydrogenation reaction. The conversion percentages of ethylene to ethane in the presence of cubic, 
cuboctahedral, and porous Pt nanoparticles as catalysts are compared, and it is found that the porous 
nanoparticles are more active than the cubic and cuboctahedral nanoparticles 6. Metal nanoparticles are often 
used as catalysts in electrochemical reactions. Ag nanowires 7 show excellent catalytic activities and go 
toward the four electron oxygen reduction path, which can enhance significantly the working efficiency of 
the fuel cell. Hollow Ag/Pd nanoshells have been found to show unique catalytic activities when used as 
catalysts for electroless copper deposition (ECD) 8,9. ECD has gained considerable significance in the field 
of nanocircuits 10. The mechanism underlying ECD involves activation, which is a catalytic reaction 
triggered by active colloids on the surface of the substrates dipped into the electroless bath 11,12. The active 
catalyst acts as an electron carrier for the transfer of electrons from the reducing agent to the copper ions.   
Hence, the structure and composition of the catalyst can alter the deposition rate and reaction kinetics 13. In a 
previous study, the authors prepared spherical Pd nanoparticles and used them as activators for ECD 11,13,14. 
Additionally, for the electroless reaction, the authors synthesized solid nanocatalysts with Pd-rich shells from 
a Ag/Pd alloy by adding Ag particles to the microstructures of Pd nanoparticles; the nanocatalysts thus 
prepared showed enhanced catalytic activity 15.  
In the present study, Ag/Pd nanorings were prepared via a displacement reaction; in this reaction, a small 
amount of palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) dissolved in acetate acid (CH3COOH) was allowed to galvanically 
react with Ag nanoparticles. A small amount of the deposited Pd alloyed with Ag. The displacement process 
resulted in the formation of bimetallic nanorings. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping was 
employed to measure the relative atomic distribution of Ag to Pd in the microstructure of the synthesized 
nanoring. The synthesized Ag/Pd nanorings were used as activators for ECD. Ag/Pd nanorings, pure Pd, and 
Ag nanoparticles were used as catalysts, and their effects on the kinetics of ECD were compared using results 
from quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. 
1.2  Experimental 
Ag/Pd nanorings were prepared in the following manner: initially, 25 μmoles of silver nitrate was 
gradually dissolved in 3 ml of a neutral aqueous solution of 0.1 M sodium n-dodecyl sulphate (SDS). 
Approximately 25 μl of 0.1 M NaBH4 was added dropwise to the abovementioned solution in order to 
reduce the Ag ions to metallic Ag. The solution temperature was maintained at 30 °C. After 10 min, Ag 
nanoparticles were obtained. Approximately 2.496 mg of Pd(OAc)2 was gradually dissolved in 1 ml of pure

1.4  Conclusion 
Ag/Pd nanorings were successfully prepared by a galvanic displacement reaction, in which a small amount 
of Pd(OAc)2 dissolved in CH3COOH was allowed to react slowly with previously synthesized Ag nanoparticles, 
which acted as templates. The EDX element mapping showed that the prepared nanorings were alloys of Ag and 
Pd; these nanorings showed better catalytic activity for ECD than did Ag and Pd nanoparticles. These Ag/Pd 
nanorings thus constitute a novel class of catalysts for ECD.

2. Porous Ag-Pd Triangle Nanoplates with Tunable Alloy Ratio for Catalyzing     
Electroless  Copper  Deposition     
2.1  Introduction 
Electroless copper deposition (ECD) has gained considerable importance in view of the advancement in 
the circuit industry [1–3]. ECD is frequently used to deposit conductive copper on an insulating substrate. 
Activation, which is a catalytic reaction, is induced by active colloids present on the surface of substrates 
that are dipped into the ECD bath. An active catalyst acts as an electron carrier and transfers electrons from 
the reducer to the metal ions. Accordingly, the structure and composition of the activator can influence the 
deposition rate and the reaction kinetics [4–9]. Porous metallic nanoparticles are promising candidates for 
catalysis [10, 11]. In a previous study, the present authors prepared mesoporous Pd nanoparticles by 
chemical reduction and used these nanoparticles as activators for ECD [4, 12]. The activity of Ag-Pd alloy 
nanocatalysts with Pd-rich shells is improved when Ag is added to the microstructure of Pd nanoparticles 
[13]. In addition, large triangular Ag-Pd nanoplates show unique chemical characterization when they 
catalyzed ECD bath [14]. In this study, porous Ag-Pd triangular nanoplates with three alloy ratios were 
synthesized by a galvanic displacement reaction in which Ag triangular nanoplates reacted with Pd ions. 
These Ag-Pd nanoplates were then used as potential ECD activators. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) 
measurements were used to compare the ECD activities of (1) three Ag-Pd nanoplates with different 
compositions, (2) Ag nanoplates, and (3) Pd nanoparticles.  
2.2  Experimental 
Triangular Ag-Pd nanoplates with different compositions were prepared as follows. Initially, 0.05 ml of 
0.05 M AgNO3 aqueous solution was added to 10 ml of 2.5 × 10-4 M aqueous sodium citrate solution. Then, 
0.025 ml of 0.1 M NaBH4 was gradually added to a stirred solution of sodium citrate and AgNO3; a light 
yellow Ag seed solution was obtained. Then, 1 ml of 0.05 M AgNO3 was added to 200 ml of 0.1 M 
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Next, 10 ml of 0.1 M ascorbic acid and 0.182 ml of the 
prepared Ag seed solution were slowly added to the aqueous solution of CTAB. Finally, 0.8 ml of 2 M NaOH 
aqueous solution was added to this CTAB solution to synthesize Ag triangular nanotemplates. A 200-ml 
solution containing the triangular Ag nanoplates synthesized earlier was precipitated by centrifugation at 
4,000 rpm and redispersed in 30 ml of deionized water; this was done to reduce the interaction of free CTAB 
with the synthesized Ag-Pd nanoplates. Then, to prepare Ag18Pd1 nanoplates, ~1.25 mg of Pd(OAc)2 slowly 
dissolved in 1 ml of pure acetic acid to obtain 5.56 × 10-3 M Pd2+ solution for the galvanic displacement 
reaction. At a fixed controlled temperature of 60°C, ~50 µl of 5.56 × 10-3 M Pd(OAc)2 (2.78 × 10-7 moles) 
solution was added to 3 ml of a stirred solution of Ag nanoplates that did not contain free CTAB. Porous 
Ag-Pd nanoplates with an Ag–Pd molar ratio of 18:1 were obtained after 60 min. The pathway for this 
displacement synthesis is shown in Figure 1. Ag18Pd1.5 or Ag18Pd2 nanoplates can be obtained by using 50 µl 
of Pd(OAc)2 solution with concentrations of 8.33 × 10-3 M (4.17 × 10-7 moles) and 1.112 × 10-2 M (5.56 × 10-7 
moles), respectively. Ag-Pd nanoplates were dipped onto the copper grid that was covered with a carbon film 
and dried naturally. The characteristic size and shape of the nanoplates were observed under a high-resolution 
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; JEOL JEM-3000F) and with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) 
spectroscope.

EDX spectroscopy analyses of the porous nanoplates yielded information on the architecture. Fig. 3 
shows the line-scan EDX spectrum obtained from the EDX analysis of a single Ag18Pd1 nanoplate. The two 
strong random signals in the EDX spectrum were attributed to Pd and Ag. This indicates that the porous 
nanoplate prepared by this method has a mixed-alloy structure.

From these values, we inferred that porous Ag-Pd nanoplates can be successfully used as a catalyst in 
ECD. Note that the electroless deposition rate and the catalytic activity of the nanoplates increased linearly 
with a decrease in the concentration of the Pd2+ solution used in the synthesis of the nanoplates. The catalytic 
activity of the nanocatalyst was calculated using the following formula: 
Catalytic activity = deposition rate/(catalyst weight × Pd content in weight%) 
Here, the Pd content was determined from the EDX analyses; the values listed in Table 1. The catalytic 
activities of the Ag18Pd2 and Ag18Pd1.5 nanoplates were 0.033 cm-2⋅s-1 and 0.125 cm-2⋅s-1, respectively. The 
activity of the Ag18Pd1 nanoplate was 1.003 cm-2⋅s-1. Note that the order of the activities was as follows: 
Ag18Pd1 nanoplate > Ag18Pd1.5 nanoplate > Ag18Pd2 nanoplate. This indicated that the Ag18Pd1 nanoplate 
would have the maximum catalytic power in the ECD reaction. 
LSV measurements were performed to study the activity of Ag/Pd nanoplates in ECD in detail. Figure 5 
shows the current-potential (I-E) curves for the oxidation of formaldehyde in the anodic bath. Firstly, as 
shown in the insert, all prepared Ag/Pd nanoplates showed inert activities in the alkaline NaOH solution.  In 
the anodic bath with formaldehyde, oxidation was observed to have a starting potential of approximately 
-0.175 V. The oxidation current density increased slowly with the potential, and we observed a 
diffusion-limited current at approximately 0.02 V. The oxidation current density of formaldehyde in the ECD 
bath increased in the following order: Ag18Pd1 nanoplate > Ag18Pd1.5 nanoplate > Ag18Pd2 nanoplate. These 
LSV results show that the high activity of Ag18Pd1 nanoplate was due to its high tendency to oxidize 
formaldehyde.

3.  Electrochemical synthesis of Pd–NiO nanoparticles in water-in-oil microemulsions     
for activating electroless Ni deposition 
 
3.1  Introduction 
Electroless Ni–P deposition (END) is an important surface treatment in industry because it gives 
excellent protection against corrosion, hardness, and wear resistance 1, 2. Although several factors, such as the 
composition of the deposition solution 2-4 and the choice of ligand 5-7, affect the performance of an electroless 
process, the activation step is a key factor in controlling the rate and mechanism of electroless deposition8. 
The catalytic reaction is activated by an active colloid on the surface of a substrate dipped in an electroless 
deposition bath. The active catalyst is an electron carrier and transfers electrons from the reducer to the metal 
ions. The catalyzed metal is thus deposited on the active colloid 9, 10. In END, the initial activation step is 
catalysis of an active colloid toward hypophosphite 11, 12; hypophosphite is a reducing agent for Ni2+ in END 
baths. In this anodic process, the bond between the H radical and the hypophosphite radical is first broken by 
an energy above the activation energy of 17.7 kcal mol-1 12. In comparison, the activation energy for metal 
reduction by a cathodic pathway is 6.5–7.5 kcal mol-1 12. The formed hypophosphite radical is then oxidized to 
yield phosphate, releasing an electron for Ni reduction. Simultaneously, the H radicals produced in the first 
step can form H2 gas by recombination 12. The choice of active colloid therefore plays an important role in 
enhancing the rate. Ohno and co-workers successfully identified the order of the activation energies for the 
  15
and Ni foil in a H2O/TOAB/THF microemulsion. 
 
Electrochemical measurement of activator.  
The synthesized Pd–NiO nanoparticles of different sizes were then used as END activators. The bath 
compositions for all the electrochemical experiments are shown in Table 1 and have been reported elsewhere 
14, 15. The electrochemical experiments were carried out in baths controlled at 85 °C and N2 gas was bubbled 
through the solutions for 15 min prior to the measurements.

For the kinetics experiments, an EQCM instrument consisting of a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT30, 
Metrohm Autolab, Runcorn, UK) and a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM; SEIKO QCA 922, Seiko, Chiba, 
Japan) was used. The working electrode was prepared by applying 3 µL of a solution of the active Pd–NiO 
colloid uniformly on a 0.159 cm2 Au surface on the QCM substrate. The solutions were prepared using 
[H2O]/[TOAB] = 0 and 3.96 µg of alloy catalyst; [H2O]/[TOAB] = 2.22 and 8.22 µg of alloy catalyst; and 
[H2O]/[TOAB] = 5.56 and 48.36 µg of alloy catalyst. The QCM substrate (SEIKO EG&G QA20-A9M-Au, 
Seiko, Chiba, Japan) was sputtered on both sides with Au on top of a Ti film of thickness 100 Å, and was 
connected to a laboratory-built oscillator. The reference electrode (Hg/Hg2Cl2) was separated from the main 
solution compartment by a Luggin capillary, which was filled with saturated KCl solution.  
3.3  Results and discussion 
Figure 2A presents a clear TEM image of the nanoparticles prepared in the THF electrolyte with 
[H2O]/[TOAB] = 0 as described in the experimental section. This figure demonstrates that ultrafine 
nanoparticles were successfully prepared via this double-anode reaction, in which both Pd and Ni were used 
as anodes and inert Pt was used as the cathode in a water-in-oil microemulsion.

[H2O]/[TOAB] ratios. (A) [H2O]/[TOAB] = 0; (B) [H2O]/[TOAB] = 2.22; and (C) 
[H2O]/[TOAB] = 5.56. 
 
Figs. 2B and 2C show the TEM images of the nanoparticles prepared in microemulsions with 
[H2O]/[TOAB] ratios of 2.22 and 5.56, respectively. Comparison of these TEM images with that of Pd–NiO 
nanoparticles prepared in pure THF solution (Fig. 2A) shows that larger nanoparticles were obtained with 
increasing [H2O]/[TOAB] values and that their shapes did not alter significantly. The corresponding sizes are 
show in Figs. 3B and 3C. The sizes of the nanoparticles prepared in electrolytes with [H2O]/[TOAB] = 2.22 
and 5.56 were 5.6 nm and 7.51 nm, respectively. The water-in-oil microemulsion approach has often been 
used to synthesize metal nanoparticles chemically 18. Reducing agents, including aqueous N2H4 and NaBH4, 
in micelles were percolated into other micelles containing metal salts. A chemical reduction reaction therefore 
occurred and metal nanoparticles grew 18. In this study, in contrast, nanoparticles were successfully prepared 
via electrochemical reduction by the passage of a reducing current. As the [H2O]/[TOAB] value increased 
from 0 to 5.56, the response in the cell voltage decreased from 499 V to 83 V. This decreased overpotential 
plausibly led to an increase in the size and in the yield of the prepared nanoparticles. Additionally, an increase 
in [H2O]/[TOAB] can prop up the micelles and further increase their core sizes. This is the other reason to 
increase the nanoparticles’ size.   
XRD analysis of the prepared nanoparticles yields information on the composition architecture. Figure 4 
presents XRD spectra of the prepared 2.9-nm, 5.6-nm, and 7.5-nm nanoparticles. The diffraction peaks in all 
three cases are obtained at the same locations, i.e., between those of Pd (JCPDS No. 89-4897) and those of 
NiO (JCPDS No. 78-0643). This indicates that the nanoparticles prepared using this electrochemical method 
consist of a Pd–NiO alloy. Three peaks located at 39.81°, 46.35°, and 67.68° detected from dry powders of 
particles of diameter 7.5 nm are respectively assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) diffraction planes of the 
face-centred cubic (fcc) structure. It is worth noting that comparison with the standard spectra of Pd and NiO 
shows that the diffraction peaks of the Pd–NiO nanoparticles prepared by the electrochemical method were 
located close to those of Pd, indicating Pd-rich nanoparticles. The two peaks located at 33.5° and 59.97° 
indicate Pd oxidation. XPS analysis of the prepared nanoparticles yields further information on Pd and Pd 
oxidation. The inset in Fig. 4 shows XPS between 330 eV and 350 eV for the 5.6-nm nanoparticles. 
  19
oxidized Pd 19. The significant difference in the peak area of Pd and that of PdO supports the composition of 
the dark nanoparticles being metallic Pd with trace oxidation. XPS was also used to confirm the existence of 
NiO. Figs. 5A, 5B, and 5C show the XPS from 840 nm to 890 nm for nanoparticles of size 2.9 nm, 5.6 nm, 
and 7.5 nm, respectively. The peak at 853.7 eV for 2P3/2 in all three cases indicates that these nanoparticles 
were composed of two chemical states, i.e., Ni and NiO, consistent with the standard spectrum of Ni in NiO 20. 
This strongly suggests that the prepared nanoparticles are Pd–NiO nanoparticles. The XPS results were used 
to measure the elemental ratios of Pd to Ni (RPd/Ni) for the prepared nanoparticles in all three cases. The RPd/Ni 
values were approximately 0.49, 0.36, and 0.39 for the 2.9-nm, 5.6-nm, and 7.5-nm nanoparticles, 
respectively. This indicates that the amount of Ni in the nanoparticles was slightly improved by increasing 
[H2O]/[TOAB].

We then tested the feasibility of using the prepared Pd–NiO nanoparticles for END. It is worth noting 
that the activities of the prepared Pd–NiO nanoparticles are remarkable and higher than that of Pd 
nanoparticles in the early stages of END. An EQCM was used to measure the effect of catalyst alloyed using

In theory, the amount of Cu deposited is sensitive to frequency changes, as expressed by Sauerbrey’s 
equation 22

02F
FA
m −
Δ=Δ μρ  
where Δm (µg cm-2) is the increased mass after deposition, ΔF is the frequency change, F0 is the starting 
frequency, A is the area of the Au substrate (0.159 cm2), μ is the shear modulus of quartz (2.947 × 1011 g cm-1 
s-2), and ρ is the density of quartz (2.648 g cm-3). Based on Sauerbrey’s equation, the deposition rates using 
different Pd–NiO nanocatalysts can be calculated. The obtained deposition rate (Fig. 6B) over the used 
catalyst weight is the mass activity, as shown in Fig. 6C. The calculated results are summarized in Table 2. 
Another surprising finding is that the electroless kinetics is influenced not only by the addition of NiO, but 
also by the diameter of the Pd–NiO nanoparticles. The addition of NiO shortened the induction time. A small 
catalyst size enhanced the slope of the active curve. For instance, for 2.9 nm, the slope increased after the 
induction period. As shown in Table 2, the mass activities of the 5.6-nm and 7.5-nm nanoparticles were 1.28 × 
10-2 cm-2 s-1, and 0.32 × 10-2 cm-2 s-1, respectively. For the 2.9-nm nanoparticles, the mass activity was 1.84 × 
10-2 cm- 2s-1. In our previous study, based on the same bath composition, Pd nanoparticles were inactive 
around 500 s before triggering the END reaction 14. In this study, the Pd–NiO activator showed significant 
activity within 130 s and started at 20 s, as observed in Fig. 6C. A comparison of the mass activities of 
systems with various Pd–NiO nanoparticles indicates that the activity increases with decreasing nanoparticle 
size. The mass activity is the activity per surface atom. In general, for smaller nanoparticles, the surface atoms 
are coordinated by less core atoms. The surface atoms on the smaller nanoparticles thus show higher activity 
in catalysis. In this study, 2.9 nm nanoparticles showed the maximum activity in mass activity, indicating the 
higher activity per surface atom. This is probably because the surface atoms on the very fine particles become 
the dominant factor. 
 
3.4  Conclusion 
We have developed a novel method for the electrochemical preparation of Pd–NiO nanoparticles in a 
water-in-oil microemulsion, namely H2O/TOAB/THF. The size of the prepared nanoparticles was controlled 
using the [H2O]/[TOAB] concentration ratio. In this study, the prepared Pd–NiO nanoparticles were 
successfully used as active colloids for END. The electroless kinetics is influenced not only by the addition of 
NiO, but also by the diameter of the Pd–NiO nanoparticles. Adding Ni to active colloids can shorten the 
induction time. The alloy particle size can accelerate END reactions because steady-state deposition is 
achieved more quickly.

Electroless nickel deposition is a catalytic reaction and an important industrial surface treatment method 
owing to its good corrosive protection, hardness and wear resistance [1].  Although the performance of an 
electroless process is influenced by numerous factors, including the composition of the deposition solution  
[2] and the choice of ligands [3], catalysis is the key factor in controlling the rate and mechanism of 
electroless deposition [4].

In this study, Pd/Ni nanoparticles of various diameters were prepared in an electrochemical cell composed 
of two anodes and one cathode, at which both of Pd and Ni foil were simultaneously used as anodic 
electrodes and Pt foil was used as cathodic foil. Their images observed by transmission electron microscope 
(TEM) are shown in Figure 1.  
 These alloy nanoparticles are electroreduced from 
nickel and palladium ion dissolved from Pd and Ni 
anodes and their diameters were controlled from 2.87 
nm to 7.51 nm by the added H2O amount in a 
tetrahydrofuran electrolyte containing micelles of 
tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB). The size of 
TOAB micelle has to be regulated. As the H2O amount 
increased, the structure of the TOAB micelle changed; 
this caused the Pd/Ni nanoparticles to grow and be 
easily oxidized to NiO on the surface. This result was 
confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectrum. Pd/Ni 
nanoparticles with oxidized surface were thus 
obtained. 
 Then, these alloy nanoparticles were tested as a 
novel activator for electroless nickel deposition and the  
activities were in-situly measured by electrochemical 
quartz crystal microbalance. In a comparison between 
the activities of Pd/Ni nanoparticles, the smallest  Figure 1. TEM images of electroreduced Pd/Ni
