reproducible bipolar resistive switching 
characteristics are observed with CC varying from 1 
nA to 50 uA and unipolar resistive switching is 
observed with CC of >100 uA. The memory device 
represents excellent memory characteristics with a 
high resistance ratio of ~1e5 for bipolar and ~1e9 
for unipolar characteristics. In fact, the resistive 
switching properties using W, IrOx, Cu to electrodes 
are superior as compared to that of Al electrode, due 
to formation of AlOx at the Al/GeOx interface. This 
memory device can have large size of >6 Pbit/sq. inch 
with a low CC of 1 nA and the device size could be <1 
nm in future. 
Furthermore, the oxygen vacancy filament can be 
controlled through a tiny (1.3 nm diameter) IrOx 
nano-dot. The improved resistive switching parameters 
such as stable SET and RESET voltages, HRS/LRS with a 
acceptable ratio of >10, long read endurance of 105 
times, and extrapolated 10 years data retention at 
85oC are obtained. Novel single IrOx/AlOx/W cross-bar 
memory has a good uniformity, low voltage (<2V) and 
low current (<200 uA) operation, and extrapolated 10 
years of data retention at 85oC is reported. Due to 
the promising memory characteristics with low power 
operation, the device can be useful in future high-
density nanoscale (<10 nm) 3D IC stack.  Further 
study is needed to identify the effective two 
electrodes and one resistive switching material for 
future mass production.

       1. Introduction 
      In order to overcome the technical and physical limits of the conventional Flash memory 
technology, an alternative and emerging memory technology such as resistive switching random access 
memory (RRAM) device is one of the promising candidate for next generation nonvolatile memories 
[1-6]. Recently, RRAM devices with different solid-electrolytes and binary oxides such as GeSe [3-5, 
7], Ta2O5 [8], WOx [9-11], HfOx [12-15], Al2O3 [16-17], GeOx/SrTiOx [18], NiO [19-22] etc have been 
reported extensively by several groups for next generation non-volatile memory (NVM) applications. 
However several reported results show that the binary oxide materials are suffering from non-uniform 
resistive switching properties in terms of SET/RESET voltages, low resistance state (LRS), and high 
resistance state (HRS) variations. These non-uniform behaviors of resistive switching properties are 
due to the random formation of conducting filaments [3-5, 14]. To solve this problem several models 
such as bi-layer structures [14, 16−17], and doped materials [15, 20] have been proposed. Extensive 
articles have been also reported to evaluate and improve the memory characteristics by using of 
nanocrystals [23-24]. WOx –based RRAM is one of the promising candidates because of its simple 
fabrication process and compatible with the back-end-line process in standard CMOS technology [9-
11]. Rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) process based WOx layer shows improved resistive switching 
properties compare to down-stream plasma oxidation (DSPO) process reported by W. C. Chien et. al. 
[9] However nonlinear behavior of current-voltage (I-V) hysteresis curve and small high resistance 
state (HRS) to low resistance state (LRS) ratios ~ 5 are obtained by RTO WOx.  
Some other materials such as, the electrically conducting iridium dioxide (IrOx) belongs to a 
class of materials with high thermal stability and very large work function. Furthermore, the crossbar 
architecture with different switching material appears is most promising candidate due to its high-

crossbar architecture have been investigated. The improved resistive switching parameters such as 
stable SET and RESET voltages, HRS/LRS with a acceptable ratio of >10, long read endurance of 105 
times, and extrapolated 10 years data retention at 85oC under PF are obtained owing to the filament 
controlled at the IrOx-NDs/oxygen-rich AlOx interface. Due to the high-charge trapping density, 
controllable O2- ions migration, and nano filament formation through the core-shell IrOx-ND under 
PF, the improvement of the resistive switching memory characteristics is evident and the switching 
mechanism is explained successfully. A large memory size of >60 Tbit/sq. inch can be obtained. Novel 
IrOx/AlOx/W cross-bar architecture with excellent uniformity, low voltage (<2V) and low current 
(<200 μA) operation, and extrapolated 10 years of data retention at 85oC is reported. Excellent read 
endurance of 106 cycles with multi-level operation is also obtained. The multi-level operation is 
achieved by both current compliance and stop voltage changes.

system. The schematic view of our fabricated memory device is shown in the Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2. Memory characteristics using W top electrode 
The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of the W/GeOx:WOx 
nanoscale mixture/W resistive memory device is shown in the Fig. 2. The area of the memory device is 
approximately 150×150 nm2. The thickness of memory layer (GeOx:WOx mixture) is ~12 nm showing 
a polycrystalline nature, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). Due to the poly-crystalline structure of 
GeOx:WOx mixture, initially the memory device remains in LRS. After few cycles the memory device 
is showing stable resistive switching properties, which can be called forming process. To investigate 
the internal structure of the memory layer, the HRTEM image has been taken under the SET operation 
at current compliance (ICC) of 100 µA, which is shown in Fig. 2(b). The thickness of the memory layer 
is increased (~ 14 nm) under SET operation compare to pristine one. Different layers with W, 
GeOx:WOx mixture, and WOx are revealed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis which is shown 
in the Fig. 3.

The formation of GeOx:WOx mixture and WOx are confirmed by XPS, shown in Fig. 4. The 
formation of WOx/GeOx:WOx bi-layer is also confirmed by XPS depth profile which is shown in the 
Fig. 4 (a). The peak fitting of Ge3d, Ge2p, and W4f core-level electrons were performed by Shirley 
background subtraction and Gaussian/Lorentzian functions. The binding energies of the Ge3d core-
level electrons are centered at 29.4 eV and 32.1 eV, which is shown in the Fig. 4(b). The lower 
binding energy peak of Ge3d~ 29.4 eV is related to the non-oxidized germanium atoms, while the 
higher binding energy peak of Ge3d~ 32.1 eV is referred to oxidized germanium atoms [31]. The peak 
binding energies of W4f5/2 signals are found to be 33.5 eV and 37.8 eV [32]. Here also the lower 
binding energy is referred to the pure tungsten metal and the higher binding energy is related to 
tungsten oxide (WO3). Similarly the peak binding energies of W4f7/2 signals are found to be 31.4 eV 
for W and 35.9 eV for WO3 [32]. The W4f oxide and non-oxide signals suggest the formation of 
tungsten oxide at the GeOx/W interface, i.e, GeOx:WOx mixture at the GeOx/W interface. The binding 
energies of the Ge2p core level electrons are found to be 1218 and 1220.4 eV respectively, as shown 
in Fig. 4(c). The lower binding energy peak is related to the non-oxidized germanium atoms and the 
higher binding energy peak is referred to the oxidized germanium atoms. A shift of the Ge2p binding 
energy peak by 2.4 eV, indicates the formation of sub-oxides of Ge (mixture of Ge2+ and Ge3+ 
oxidation states) rather than GeO2 [31]. Due to this GeOx solid-electrolyte, improved resistive 
switching performance has been obtained. 
Figure 5 shows the excellent resistive switching properties of W/GeOx:WOx/W resistive 
memory device compare to W/WOx/W structure. During current-voltage (I-V) hysteresis measurement 
±6 V was applied. The sweeping voltages are as follows: 0 →+6→ 0→ -6→0 (arrows: 1→2→3→4). 
The step voltage and delay times are 100 mV and 0.1 ms, respectively, during measurement. A low 
current compliance (ICC) at SET polarity is limited by 0.1 mA. Initially the memory device remains in

2.3 Memory characteristics using IrOx/GeOx:WOx/W structure 
The resistive memory devices using thin GeOx:WOx nanoscale mixture memory layer in an 
IrOx/GeOx:WOx/W memory device structure has been also investigated in this study. The memory 
devices are showing good resistive switching properties after post metal annealing (PMA) treatment at 
400oC for 10 minutes in nitrogen ambient. To get I-V hysteresis characteristics, a formation process is 
needed, which is shown in the Fig. 7(a). Smaller formation voltages are required after PMA treatment 
of IrOx/GeOx:WOx/W memory device structure. Lower SET/RESET and operating voltages are 
obtained after PMA treatment which is the advantage for low power operation, Fig. 7(b).  Stable 
retention characteristic and higher resistance ratio has been observed after PMA treatment, Fig. 8. 
Moreover, good resistive switching characteristics are obtained by using high work-function IrOx 
metal gate electrode.

higher CC of 50 μA, the filament diameter is increased and the shape of the filament will be a 
pyramid-type in the GeOx solid-electrolyte [(Fig. 10(g)]. It indicates that the Cu filament remains after 
the RESET [Fig. 10(h)] process. This will also be helpful to form Cu filament easily after the next 
SET because of the local field enhancement at the tip of remaining filament at BE. In consequence, 
the value of leakage current at a Vread of -0.1V is also increased from 1.68 to 84.8 pA, which may be 
due to the effective thickness reduction of the GeOx solid-electrolyte because of Cu at BE. The 
leakage current at HRS is further increased from 42.8 pA to 3.5 μA for a CC of 100 µA (cycle 9), 
which is due to the strong filament formation, as shown in Fig. 10(i). After the next cycle the device is 
permanently at LRS and it is difficult to break the filament using the negative polarity on the TE. Re-
growth of the Cu filament has been found to start from -0.75V. At -1.1 V the current can reach up to 
50 mA and there is no RESET, as shown in cycle 10. It indicates that a high amount of Cu can be 
diffused through the GeOx solid-electrolyte and will be deposited on the W bottom electrode after few 
DC cycles with a CC of 100 µA. This suggests that the Cu can be re-grown on the Cu filament at TE 
side from the Cu/W bottom electrode under negative bias on TE [Fig. 10(j)].  To dissolve the Cu 
filament, positive polarity on TE is applied again. Stable URS characteristics are observed, as shown 
in Fig. 10(k) (cycles 11-17). Corresponding RESET and SET mechanisms have been illustrated in 
Figs. 10(l) & (i). In case of URS, Joule heating is responsible to dissolve the Cu nano-filament. A 
RESET voltage for URS is approximately +0.5V. After RESET process, HRS is found to be the same 
with the pristine one, which means that the filament is fully dissolved in the GeOx solid-electrolyte. 
From this, we can assume there is no thermal damage in the GeOx solid electrolyte. It is concluded 
that the BRS mode can be applied up to the CC of 50 µA and the URS mode can be observed at higher 
CC of >100 µA. After the URS RESET process, our memory device can start from the 1st cycle, as 
shown in 18th & 19th cycles. In most of the reported results in the literatures [33-34], it is not easy to

device as well as a high resistance ratio of ~109 is obtained [Fig. 12(b)]. The RESET current (IRESET) 
increases linearly with increasing the CC [Fig. 12(c)]. However, IRESET is lower than the CC, which is 
very useful for scaling of the memory device in future. 
Figure 13(a) shows excellent read endurance characteristics of more than 105 times at a Vread of 
+0.15V are observed for both modes. There is no degradation of read endurance up to 105 times. 
Excellent resistance ratio of ~105 for bipolar and ~109 for unipolar modes is obtained. Excellent data 
retention characteristics of Cu/GeOx/W memory cell in both BRS and URS modes [Fig. 13(b)]. The 
read voltage (Vread) is +0.1 V. The data retention is measured after stressing at a CC of 50 µA for BRS 
and 100 µA for URS modes. Stable currents for both modes are observed with an elapsed time of >104 
s. Depending on the requirements, the repeatable switching mode can be obtained for future high-
density low power logic and nonvolatile memory applications.

Fig. 15 (a) shows the size and density of the IrOx-NDs in MIS structure. The thickness of 
Al2O3 blocking oxide is 8 nm. As-deposited IrOx nanolayer shows self-assembly NDs because as-
deposited layer is very thin (1.5 nm). Isolated IrOx-NDs are observed clearly [Fig. 15(b)]. The IrOx-
NDs have high-density of approximately 1×1013/cm2 [Fig. 15(c)], which results a large memory size of 
>60 Tbit/sq. inch. The nano-dots are core-shell structure [Fig. 15(d)]. Core-region of the NDs is Ir-rich 
and shell-region is oxygen-rich or IrAlO mixture. It is indicated that oxygen vacancies (Vo) can be 
observed in the core-region and oxygen accumulations (O2-) can be observed in the shell-region. The 
IrOx-NDs have a nanoscale average diameter of approximately 1.3 nm [Fig. 15(e)]. The hole or

is observed for the pure Al2O3 chrage-trapping layers [Fig. 16(b)]. The neutral flat-band voltages 
(VFBN) are found to be +0.15V and -0.25V for the IrOx-ND and pure Al2O3 devices (not shown here). 
The hole and electron trapping densities can be calculated using equation in Ref. 35. High hole 
trapping densities for the pure  Al2O3 and IrOx-NDs  capacitors are found to be ~ 5.6×1011/cm2 and ~ 
3.1×1012/cm2, respectively [Fig. 16(b)]. Almost no electrons are trapped in the core-region IrOx-ND 
under positive voltage but holes are trapped on the shell-region under negative bias on the IrOx 
electrode. This suggests that the holes can be trapped on the nano-dot surface easily because the 
surface has negative-type defects. These trapping holes as well as oxygen vacancy on the surface of the 
NDs will lead the conducting filament as well as resistive switching parameters under formation 
polarity, which have been explained below.

and oxygen-rich WO3 can be confirmed by XPS analysis of W4f spectra [Fig. 18(b)] in 14 nm-thick 
WOx layer. The peak binding energies of the W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 electrons are centered at 30.85 and 
33.06 eV, respectively. The energy peak separation is 2.2 eV. The positions of binding energies for 
WO34f7/2 and WO34f5/2 electrons are located at 35.43 and 37.56 eV, respectively, and these values are 
similar to the reported results at 35.0 and 37.6 eV for the WO34f7/2 and WO34f5/2 electrons, 
respectively. The W sub-oxide (WOx) located at 35.0 eV could be formed during the deposition 
process and the oxygen-vacancy could be found in the WOx films. Due to both the IrOx-NDs in the 
high-κ Al2O3/WOx bilayer structure and high charge-trapping density, improved resistive switching 
memory performance has been explained below.

A large variation of SET/RESET voltages and HRS/LRS of the Al2O3 devices are observed as 
compared to that of the IrOx-ND devices, due to randomized rupture of the conducting filament, [24] 
suggesting a stochastic nature of filament rupture in the pure Al2O3 resistive material. In case of the 
IrOx-ND devices, the diameter of the filament can be controlled by the small size (2nm) of the IrOx-
NDs owing to the higher LRS than that of the LRS in the pure Al2O3 devices [Fig. 20(c)]. The HRS of 
IrOx-ND device is lower than that of the Al2O3 device due to both thinner (~4nm) Al2O3 film and 
higher trapping density. So the filament formation/oxidation will be done easily in the 
WOx/Al2O3/IrOx-ND region under external bias voltage. The IrOx-ND devices have low SET and 
RESET powers of ~1.3 mW and ~1.5 mW, respectively. Excellent uniformity of the SET and RESET 
voltages and resistance distribution of the IrOx-ND devices show considerable promise for future 
core-shell ND-based resistive switching memory applications. 
3.8 Activation energy  
Fig. 22 shows the SET voltage versus temperature. The activation energy (EA) is calculated 
from the Arrhenius plot. The values of EA are -0.04 eV and -0.05 eV for the IrOx-ND and Al2O3 
devices, respectively. So the EA values for both the devices show similar and are close to zero. The 
conducting filaments behave semiconductor-like [37]. Both the devices are programmed with a 
voltage of -4V, a low current of -500 μA and pulse width of 500 μs. 
3.9 Read endurance and retention characteristics 
Typical LRS at a Vread of -0.2V is 1.37 kΩ and 1.18 kΩ for the IrOx-ND and Al2O3 devices, 
respectively [Fig. 23(a)]. Then the resistive memory device is erased with a voltage of +4V, a low 
current of 500 μA, and a pulse width of 500 μs. The values of HRS at a Vread of -0.2V are 0.16 MΩ

film near the vicinity of the film. In a similar way, the HRS of the IrOx-ND devices is increased from 
~30kΩ to ~122 kΩ after 104 s of retention time, which may be due to the oxidation of remaining 
filament between IrOx/Al2O3/IrOx-ND region. The LRS is slightly degraded after 104s of retention 
time while it is unchanged for the IrOx-ND devices owing to the strong filament formation through the 
IrOx-NDs. Extrapolation of LRS and HRS can guarantee 10 years of data retention while maintaining 
a high resistance ratio of >50. It is expected that a single IrOx-ND in the high-κ Al2O3/WOx bi-layer 
structure can control the resistive switching characteristics. This suggests that the scalability potential 
of RRAM device could be 2nm in future. 
3.10 Formation polarity dependency 
Fig. 24 (a) shows electrochemical formation process of our IrOx/Al2O3/IrOx-
NDs/Al2O3/WOx/W RRAM device. The pristine devices show low leakage current. The currents 
increase with increasing voltage and it is limited by current compliance (ICC) of 500 μA. The average 
leakage current under negative formation (NF) is 229.7 pA at a read voltage (Vread) of -2.0 V, while it 
is 673.3 pA under PF at a Vread of +2.0 V. Asymmetry values of the leakage currents under NF and PF 
polarities are quite reasonable due to the different work function (Φm) values of IrOx [(Φm)IrOx ≈ 5.2 eV 
[16]] and of tungsten (W) [(Φm)W ≈ 4.3-4.91 eV [38]] electrodes. Considering the electron affinities 
(χ) of 3.33eV [30] for WO3 and 1.25eV for Al2O3 layers, the values of the effective barrier heights 
(Φb) are found to be [Φb= (Φm)W-(χ)WO3] 1.3 eV and [(Φb)= (Φm)IrOx-(χ)Al2O3] 3.95 eV, respectively. So 
the electron injection at the IrOx/Al2O3 interface will be lower than that of the W/WOx interface. In 
consequence, the currents under PF increase rapidly which results a lower and tight distribution of 
formation voltages as compared to NF (6-7 V vs. -7 to -9 V). This suggests that lower formation 
voltage can protect device degradation.

  During formation process, the high electric field breaks the Al2O3 film and forms the Al-O bonds 
with oxygen vacancy as well as oxygen vacancy filament. In consequence, oxygen ions (O2-) will be 
released from the conduction channels. These oxygen ions will move from the Al2O3/IrOx-NDs/Al2O3 
stacks toward WOx layer under NF because the TE has negative polarity and the BE is grounded 
during measurement. Under PF, the oxygen ions will move toward the TE because the TE has positive 
polarity. In this case, the oxygen ions will be accumulated at the Al2O3/TE interface, i.e., oxygen-rich 
AlOx film. So the oxygen vacancy filament can be formed in the Al2O3/IrOx-NDs/Al2O3 stack. The 
WOx layer will behave as a conductiong layer under PF. After 1st RESET operation, the ReRAM 
devices under both NF and PF show bipolar resistive switching characteristics.

the next SET operation will be also easier. Due to this stable RESET, repeatable switching cycles are 
expected for the PF devices. So the HRS of the PF devices is lower as compared to the NF devices 
[Fig. 24(e)], due to shorter length filament oxidized. Basically, the limitation of electron injections 
(O2- ions migration) can control the charge trapping (filament oxidation)/de-trapping (filament 
formation) through the IrOx-ND boundary. A similar study has been reported by other group [34].

900oC during the whole oxidation process. For growing SiO2 layer with a thickness of ~200 nm, 
oxygen with a flow rate of 2.5 SLM and hydrogen with a flow rate of 4 SLM were used, and deposition 
time was 90 min. At the way to get the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) based devices, firstly 150 nm-
thick tungsten (W) layer as a bottom electrode (BE) was deposited by rf reactive sputtering system. A 
W target was used to deposit BE layer.  Only argon (Ar) gas with a flow rate of 25 SCCM and a 
deposition power of 150W were maintained during the deposition process. W deposited wafer then 
transferred to a spin coater for HMDS and photo-resist. During the spinning process, first spin was 
maintained at 3000 rotations per minute for 10 s and second spin was maintained at 5000 rotations per 
minute for 20 s. As a result 1µm thick PR was coated on the W layer. Then, PR coated wafer was 
transferred to the mask aligner. First mask was used with an expose time of the UV light was 4 s. Then 
the wafer was developed to get the pattern of the BE layer. After that the patterned wafer was deep in 
the W selective etching solution for 3-4 min. Finally the wafer with bottom W bars was ready for the 
further process. Again the wafer went through the same photo-lithography process.

HP4156C precision semiconductor parameter analyzer. 
4.2 HRTEM images with EDX confirmation 
Fig. 29(a) shows HRTEM image of the  IrOx/AlOx/W single cross-point ReRAM device with 
an area of 2×2 μm2. The thicknesses of IrOx, AlOx, and W are found to be 200, 8, and 150 nm, 
respectively. The AlOx film shows amorphous in nature. Layer by layer of the fabricated devies has 
been confirmed by EDX analysis as indicated in Fig. 29(b). Cu as TEM grid was used during the 
analysis of IrOx, AlOx, and W layers. The counts of Cu is observed for all layers, is the strong 
evidance of the preasence of Cu grid. The oxygen counts at an energy of ~0.5 keV are found in the 
IrOx, AlOx and also in W films. Fig. 29(c) shows typical HRTEM image of cross-point RRAM device 
with IrOx-NDs. The IrOx-NDs with a thickness of approximately 1.5nm are sandwiched in between 
high-κ Al2O3 layers with a thickness of approximately 5nm and 3nm. A small size of ~1.3 nm in a 
diameter is observed. All layers has been confirmed by EDX analysis. 
4.3 XPS analysis 
All materials have been also confirmed by XPS characteristics. Fig. 30(a) shows the broad 
spectra of the cross-point devices. The O, Ir, Al and W elements can be observed clearly from the 
broad scan view. Fig. 30(b) shows the W4f spectra in the BE layer. The peak fitting is performed by 
using Shirley background subtraction and Gaussian–Lorentzian functions. The binding energy peaks 
confirms the presence of the pure W and WOx films. The peak energy values are found to be 30.85 
and 33.06 eV for the W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 electrons, respectively. Those values are the similar with the 
reported results at 31.8 eV for the W4f7/2 electrons and 33.9 eV for the W4f5/2 electrons. The binding 
energy positions are shifted to the higher energy side for the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 spectra, refers to the

are also similar with the reported results at 35.6 and 37.7 eV for the bleached and satellite electrons, 
respectively. It shows that the binding energies of the W4f5/2 and W4f7/2 electrons behave metallic

shows the cycle-to-cycle variation of the pure high-κ AlOx and IrOx-ND based cross-point ReRAM 
devices at room temperature (RT). Consecutive 104 hysteresis sweeping cycles has been measured at a 
ICC of 200µA for both of the devices. Very stable resistive switching can be observed for the IrOx-ND 
based cross-point ReRAM devices as compare to the pure high-κ AlOx based devices, due to the 
confinement of the filament through the IrOx nanocrystal. Good hysteresis of 103 cycles are also 
achieved for both of the devices at 85oC [Fig. 31 (d)], with resistance ratio of >25 and <10, 
respectively. Improvement in the ratio (HRS/LRS) as well as stability of both the states at 85oC is 
achieved for the device with IrOx NDs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To investigate the main current conduction mechanism of the fabricated cross-point devices, I-
V curve of high-κ AlOx devices is fitted linearly in log-log plot on positive polarity [Fig. 32]. The 
slope values of LRS current are found to be ~1.1 and ~1.9 for the first and second slope, respectively.

Excellent non-destructive read observed up to 106 times, which is very useful for design as well as 
application of the cross-point type high-density resistive switching memory device. Very good non-
destructive read of 106 cycles can be achieved for the HRS levels with VSTOP values of -2.0V and -
1.5V [Fig. 34(b)]. During the program/erase cycle the programming voltage and ICC was fixed at 
+2.0V and 200 μA. A reading problem at a read voltage of +0.2V can be observed when the erasing 
voltage was -1.2V. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7 Statistical analysis 
Excellent switching behavior with different levels is observed in many devices consistently 
and result is plotted in Fig. 35. The availability of different levels at the LRS  and HRS, are possible 
for most of the devices of IrOx ND cross-point memory. The LRS varied from 600kΩ, 70kΩ and 
30KΩ, for ICC values of 50µA, 100µA, 200µA [Fig. 35(a)] and the HRS varied from 300kΩ, 2MΩ

5.  Scalability potential of resistive memory technology 
According to several reported literatures the scalability of the resistive memory technology 
can be decreased according to the size of the filament diameter. We have calculated the Cu 
nanofilament diameters of 0.04-23.4 nm using current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with CCs of 1nA-
1mA of Al/Cu/GeSex/TaOx/W structure and these calculated values have been compared to theoretical 
values. The filament diameter is increased linearly as CC increases from 1 nA to 1 mA [Fig. 38]. The 
filament diameter is ~23.4 nm at a CC of 1 mA, which is equivalent to a memory size of >1 Tbit/sq. 
in. A small diameter of ~0.04 nm at a low CC of 1 nA is also observed. This reveals that the device 
size can be decreased to an atomic scale (~0.04 nm) in future advanced memory applications. 
Considering the non-volatility at CCs of 0.1 μA, the memory size is as high as ~6 Pbit/sq. in. Our 
calculated diameters are consistent with some of the reported data in recent literature [7, 43-47].

10 years data retention at 85oC under PF are obtained owing to the filament controlled at the IrOx-
NDs/oxygen-rich AlOx interface. Due to the high-charge trapping density, controllable O2- ions 
migration, and nano filament formation through the core-shell IrOx-ND under PF, the improvement of 
the resistive switching memory characteristics is evident and the switching mechanism is explained 
successfully. A large memory size of >60 Tbit/sq. inch can be obtained. Novel IrOx/AlOx/W cross-bar 
architecture with excellent uniformity, low voltage (<2V) and low current (<200 μA) operation, and 
extrapolated 10 years of data retention at 85oC is reported. Excellent read endurance of 106 cycles 
with multi-level operation is also obtained. The multi-level operation is achieved by both current 
compliance and stop voltage changes. It is expected that the scalability potential of this resistive 
switching memory device could be the diameter (~1.3 nm) of a single IrOx-ND in future. This 
crossbar RRAM device can be useful in future high-density nanoscale (<20 nm) 3D IC integration.

Introduction: 
           It was my great opportunity to join such a conference on different kinds of materials for 
nanoscale device applications and nanoscale memories. I am working on nanowire and nanowire 
memory devices. So, the conference was so useful for me to gain my knowledge and to collaborate 
with other academia and industries in future. Total participants were 1100. Total abstracts were 
received 956. Oral presentations were 396 and poster presentations were ~300. It is very big and good 
conference for semiconductor researchers. 
 
99/09/22    Plenary Session  
         Dr. M. Nakamura, Director, Hitachi Ltd., reported the nanotechnology status in Japan and other 
countries. He mentioned that it is important to develop nano future for mankind. We can get more 
benefit if we come together below the same roof. He also mentioned that our lifetime may not span a 
hundred years, we have the concerns of one thousand years. Dr. S. Deleonibus, Research Director, 
CEA-LETTI reported the functional diversification added to Nanoelectronics which will make possible 
new future systems to address increasing societal needs. He also mentioned that the threshold voltage 
fluctuation about 150 mV in nanoscale device which is due to the dopant fluctuation. The off-stae 
current could be reduced to 6 pA/um for 300 nm 6T SRAM device.  He indicated that 3D integration 
will address, at the wafer level, device to packaging technologies capable of reducing cost and 
improving system performance. Those lectures were very interesting and encouraged the researchers 
for future nanotechnology development.   
 
99/09/22    F-1: Graphene Structures and Transport (Area 9)  
         T. Matsui et al., University of Tokyo reported the topological Dirac Fermion on graphite surfaces. 
They have measured the dI/dV spectra on different kinds of graphite and showed that the feature of 
massless DF can be appeared topologically on the surface of graphite. This behavior can be well 
understood by theoretical calculation. The graphite has TDF originated from H point and it appears on 
the surface. It was very interesting talk. K. Wakabayashi, NIMS, Japan reported the electronic states of 
graphene and nanoribbons by the tight-binding model. The k-linear spectrum, which is signature of 
massless, Dirac electron, appears at k=0 for armchair nanoribbons and zigzag nanoribbons also have 
such linear band at k=2π/3 and -2π/3. He has also reported the electronic transport through the 
junction.Tuning either the Fermi energy or local gate voltage can switch between two states, i.e., zero-
conductance state (g=0) an dnearly perfect transmission state (g=1). M. Ryzhii et al., University of 
Aizu, Japan reported the field effect in multiple grapheme layer (MGL) structures. They demonstrated 
that the gate-voltage control can be rather effective in MGL structures with about ten or less GLs. The 
obtained results could be useful in future for creation of MGL-based field-effect transistors, as well as 
terahertz tunneling transit-time oscillators, lasers, and high performance interband photodetectors. 
 
99/09/22    F-2: Novel Structures (Area 9)  
         H. Okamoto et al., Japan reported piezoelectric effect on nanomechanical oscillators. He has 
demonstrated all-piezeelectric operation of coupled nanomechanical oscillators at room temperature. 
He has mentioned that the piezoelectric control of coupled vibration for applications of coupled 
nanomechanical oscillators, such as highly sensitive sensors, as well as for the study of the dynamics in 
coupled systems could be useful in future. I, Chang Gung University, Taiwan reported the ge nnaowire 
fabrication and memory applications. The Ge nanowires have been prepared using VLS mechanism on 
Au-catalyzed Si substrates. A broad peak in photoluminescence spectrum between 350 to 500 nm is 
due to germanium-oxygen and oxygen vacancies. Good flash and resistive memory devices are

99/09/23    E-3: Flash Memory II (Area 4)  
         M. Muraguchi et al., Tohoku University, Japan reported the electron injection process from the 
two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) to the trap site in the charge trap-nonvolatile memory (CT-
NVM) cell. The electron tunneling would be induced by a rare event by considering the geometrical 
mismatch between the 2DEG in channel and the trap site of CT-NVM cell. From this assumption, it is 
suggested the new tunneling model, where the electron tunnels to the trap sites collectively with the 
long waiting time. This insight is very important to design the CT- NVM cell. J. G. Yun et al., Seoul 
National University, South Korea reported the BEN-SONOS device with high speed, low power 
NAND flash memory application. By applying the BE-SONOS on the gate-all-around (GAA) structure, 
field concentration effect can be achieved at low operation bias (13V-17V) conditions. Program/erase 
properties were measured in the fabricated BEN-SONOS device showing fast transient characteristics. 
K. yamagichi et la., University of Tsukuba, Japan reported the effect of O- and H-incorporation into N 
vacancies in SiN charge trap layers from view points of MONOS memory characteristics. It is found 
that N vacancies maintain high P/E cycle endurance characteristics regardless of the existence H and O 
atoms. Their calculated results clearly show that N vacancies are desirable and feasible defects for 
future MONOS memories, even considering realistic process conditions. It is very interesting talk for 
future nanoscale charge trap memory applications. J. Fuziki et al., Toshiba Corporation, Japan 
extracted charge-centroid dynamics during avalanche injection, on the basis of ISPP analysis. They 
confirmed the charge-centroid movement by assuring 100% carrier capture from the ISPP formalism. 
From this measurement, carriers are trapped near the bottom of the charge layer at first and then reach 
the top interface of the charge layer. In contrast, when higher electric field is used during programming 
(e.g. FN injection) carriers are captured near the top interface of the charge layer due to the high field 
acceleration. Finally, it is revealed that the trap sites accessed by carrier injection through the tunnel 
oxide increases for low electric field. So, it is prospected that the enlargement of program window is 
possible with appropriate tunnel-oxide engineering for low-field programming. This talk was very 
useful for future NVM applications.  
 
99/09/23    P-4: Advanced Memory Technology (short presentation and poster session)  
         T. Fukushima et al., Osaka Prefecture University, Japan reported the impedance analysis using 
RC distributed constant circuit which is applicable to analysis of the channel condition of ferroelectric-
gate TFT. The results suggests that the reversal of PSFe for YMnO3 was occurred only at the region 
near the source electrode by negative gate voltage, and entire channel region becomes low resistivity 
state by positive gate voltage. J. Shin et al., Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South 
Korea reported the cross-point ReRAM device using Pt/TiO2/TiN structure. The current-voltage (I-V) 
characteristics of nanometer scale selection device can be explained by Schottky emission mechanism. 
Based on modeling and measurement, TiO2 based selection device shows sufficiently improved 
readout margin for cross-point memory array. C. W. Kuo et al., National Chiao Tung University, 
Taiwan reported a nonpolar Pt/TiO
2
/Pt ReRAM and a high forward-current Ti/TiO
2
/Pt oxide diode by 
using identical TiO
2 
by room-temperature evaporation. Owing to the simplicity of fabrication and low 
thermal budget, the proposed RRAM is attractive for the memory application in future flexible 
electronics. I. Kim et al., Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea reported the TiOx 
based resistive switching memory device for flexible applications. K. Dobashi et al., Tottori University, 
Japan reported the minimum area which was necessary to generate the resistance change effect in 
polycrystalline NiO films was one crystal grain. This suggested that the resistance change effect of 
polycrystalline NiO films occurred in the grain boundary. Therefore, it was suggested that the 
minimum limit of the downsizing of memory cells was decided by the size of one crystal grain. T. Fujii 
et al., Hokkaido University, Japan reported the identification of conduction spot (CS) for NiO based 
ReRAM device prepared at 800°C, which is the platform of filamentary conduction. Probably CS 
appears at a “weak spot” by forming. The authors mentioned that the potential of scalability on 
ReRAM is determined by the forming power. To reduce this power, an exact current compliance 
 5 
fully depleted SOI MOSFET applies body bias (BB) to the MOSFET’s channel and thus reduces the 
SS below 60 mV/dec at room temperature. A triple-gate operation shows current characteristics with 
small hysteresis, a high on/off ratio, and low drain voltage. These features promise SOI MOSFETs for 
low power consumption. R. Wang et al., Peking University, China reported the diameter dependent 
annealing in Si nanowire MOSFETs (SNWTs). The implanted dopants diffuse faster in thinner 
nanowires during annealing process. The impacts of DDA on the S/D resistance, threshold voltage 
shift, and parasitic capacitance in SNWTs are reported, providing some design tradeoffs on the S/D 
extension regions in SNWTs. A small subthreshold slope of 6.6 mV/dec is reported. S. K. Hsin et al., 
RIKEN, Japan reported the single electron transport in n-type GeNW with a diameter of 40 nm. 
Electrical characteristics of single-electron transport were probed at milli-Kelvin temperatures. 
Pronounced Coulomb peaks with the equidistant spacing in Vg were observed. While the Coulomb 
peak heights were varied very much, the dimensions of Coulomb diamonds were identical. Not only 
classical natures, but quantum natures were reported in the present device. J. Hattori et al., Nagoya 
University, Japan reported that the interaction between modulated acoustic phonons and electrons in 
gate biased SiNWs was investigated theoretically. They reported that, although with increasing gate 
voltage the form factor decreases whether with or without acoustic phonon modulation (APM), the 
APM effects become larger.  
 
99/09/24    J-7: Nanowire Growth and Applications (Area 13)  
         P. Y. Yang et al., National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan reported a new field emission device 
composed of an offset-TFT and AZO NWs FEAs. This TFT device could be operated at lower gate 
voltage and higher ON/OFF current ratio. An ON/OFF current ratio of 3.05×10
5 
was achieved while 
the gate voltage of offset-TFT switching from 0 to 30V. The stable anode current can be obtained via 
the offset-TFT control over a period of 1h and the current fluctuation of offset-TFT-controlled AZO 
NWs FEAs can be reduced to less than 2 %. C. H. Lee et al., Seoul National University, South Korea 
reported the GaN-based nanoarchitecture LED microarrays using position-controlled GaN/ZnO coaxial 
nanotube heterostructure arrays. The strong emissions from nanoarchitecture LED microarrays 
originated from individual nanoarchitectures in the green and blue visible range when a forward bias 
voltage was applied. Accordingly, from EL spectra, dominant emission peak were observed at 2.45 eV 
from GaN/In1-xGaxN MQWs. Y. Kohashi et al., Hokkaido University, Japan reported the InGaAs 
nanowire MESFETs with dielectric layer first process. G. Zhang et al., NTT Corporation, Japan 
reported the lateral GaAs growth on Si surface. The cross-sectional shape of lateral NWs can 
be varied by using substrates with different orientations. Lateral NWs with 
triangular and trapezoidal cross-sections were grown on (311) and (001) substrates. 
The ON/OFF ratio of current is ~104 and maximum transconductance is 21 mS/mm. R. H. 
Baek et al., Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), South Korea reported the 
capacitance measurement of Si nanowire. The nanowire capacitance (NWCAP) is shown to exhibit 
superior channel inversion with higher Qinv, compared with the planar metal-oxide-semiconductor 
capacitor. Thus, the performance of nanowire FET could be greatly improved with the process 
refinements made in Source/Drain contacts.  
 
99/09/24    E-8: PRAM/ReRAM (Area 4)  
         D. Kau, Intel Corporation, USA reported a survey of cross-point phase change memory (PCM). 
Two-terminal thin-film switches enable area efficient PCM layout. Among them, ovonic threshold 
switch (OTS) possesses the most compatible scaling attributes with PCM. Integrated with CMOS, 
PCMS is one of the most promising NVM technologies in scalability. K. P. Chang et al., Macronix 
International Corp., Taiwan reported the SiO2 based ReRAM device. The device shows a unipolar 
operation and self-formed diode isolation. We further clarify that the SET operation is caused by 
thermally induced Si filament formation, while RESET operation is a thermal process caused by Joule 
heating, resulting in SiO2 formation. K. Seo et al., Guangju Institute of Science and Technology, South
