 The development of phosphor-free white-light light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has become 
an important trend because of the disadvantages of using phosphors for converting light 
colors, including lower efficiency, shorter lifetime, and patent control. Various device 
schemes have been proposed for such development. Since the band gap of InGaN can cover 
up to the near-infrared range, using InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs) of different 
parameters for emitting lights of various colors to mix into white light has been attempted. By 
controlling the QW width, different levels of piezoelectric field can lead to different emission 
wavelengths [1]. In this case, however, the strong quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) in a 
QW of a large well width will result in a significant blue shift when a plenty of carriers are 
injected to produce the screening effect. Although white-light LEDs of simultaneously 
emitting two or three colors by growing InGaN/GaN QWs of different indium contents have 
been reported [2,3], the internal quantum efficiencies of the long-wavelength components 
were quite low and the QCSE screening effect was still a major problem. Also, although a 
near-white-light dual-color LED was claimed [4,5], it was actually just a blue/green 
two-color LED, not a white-light source. In implementing a multi-color LED for white-light 
generation, the major problem is the inefficient yellow-red emission. Using the emission of 
the impurity states for yellow light has been proposed. However, its efficiency is quite low 
[6,7]. Therefore, although the idea of using various InGaN/GaN QWs to mix multiple colors 
for white light has been proposed, the implementation of such a white-light LED of good 
chromaticity was never reported. The implementations of all-semiconductor white-light 
LEDs also include the use of CdSe/ZnS nano-crystals for converting blue photons into red 
light. The combination of a blue/green two-color LED with such nano-crystals led to 
white-light generation of three primary colors [8-11]. 
 In this letter, we report the growth of a blue/yellow dual-wavelength white-light 
InGaN/GaN QW LED epitaxial structure based on the prestrained growth technique [12,13]. 
The prestrain technique implies the growth of a fully strained (normally with low-indium 
content) InGaN/GaN QW to generate a tensile strain in the barriers above it for reducing the 
lattice mismatch between the well and barrier layers of the QWs grown subsequently. 
Therefore, this technique can be used for enhancing indium incorporation such that a 
long-wavelength visible-emitting QW can be grown at a relatively higher temperature and 
hence can have higher emission efficiency. The electroluminescence (EL) spectra 
corresponds to a white-light source of the coordinates in the Commission International de 
l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram close to (1/3, 1/3) and a color temperature around 
5600 K. The QCSE screening effect in the implemented white-light LED is quite small. 
 To demonstrate the contribution of the prestrained growth technique to the 
implementation of such a white-light source, we compare the optical properties of two 
InGaN/GaN QW samples. The samples were grown with metalorganic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD). The general growth structure is as follows: First, a 30-nm GaN 
nucleation layer was grown on (0001) c-plane sapphire substrate at 530 oC. Then, after the 
growth of a 2-µm n-GaN at 1080 oC, InGaN/GaN QWs of different compositions were 
deposited for the two samples. In growing the QWs in each sample, after the growth of a 
3-nm InGaN QW layer at 670 oC, the growth temperature was ramped to 870 oC within one 
minute for depositing GaN barrier of 15 nm in thickness. Abrupt interfaces between the wells 
and barriers can be achieved using this method of fast growth-temperature ramp. Such an 
abrupt interface can enhance the quantum confinement of carriers resulting in higher 
efficiency. After the growth of the QWs, a 30-nm p-Al0.2Ga0.8N layer, followed by a 120-nm 
p-GaN layer (both grown at 945 oC), was deposited. In the two samples, sample A includes 
five high-indium QWs with the growth conditions described above. In sample B, before the 
 4
the contacts of indium balls. This picture means to demonstrate the high quality white light 
without using any phosphor. 
In summary, we have grown a white-light InGaN/GaN QW LED epitaxial structure with 
its EL spectrum close to the ideal condition in CIE chromaticity based on the presrained 
MOCVD growth technique. The prestrained growth led to the efficient yellow emission from 
three InGaN/GaN QWs of increased indium incorporation. The color mixing for white light 
was implemented by adding a blue-emitting QW at the top of the yellow-emitting QWs. The 
blue shifts of the blue and yellow spectral peaks of the generated white-light EL spectra were 
only 1.67 and 8 nm, respectively, when the injection current increased from 10 to 70 mA. 
Such small blue shifts implied that the piezoelectric fields in our QWs were significantly 
weaker than those previously reported.
