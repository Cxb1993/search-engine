nesses are presented and compared to theoretical light scattering
calculations. Theoretical calculation, based on the Mie-surface
double-interaction model (MSDI), describes the angular depen-
dence of bidirectional ellipsometric (BE) data qualitatively and
predicts the general trend of the BE data as a function of ﬁlm
thickness. The sample preparation and experimental procedure
utilized for these measurements are described and discussed in
the remainder of the paper.
2. Description of the instrument
A goniometric optical scatter instrument to measure the
characteristics of out-of-plane incidence has recently been
developed at the Center for Measurement Standards (CMS)/
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Fig. 1(a) shows
an overall schematic diagram of the GOSI. An incidence ray from
diode-pumped solid state laser (Newports Excelsior Scientiﬁc CW
Laser, 532nm, single mode) passes through an iris (I), an optical
chopper (C), a l/2 waveplate (WP), a Glan–Thompson polarizer
(POL), the second WP mounted on a computer controlled rotation
stage, a lens (L), a pinhole (P), and the second I before being
focused with a super-polished concave mirror (M) at the center of
a goniometer. The focused beam is received by the angle-deﬁning
aperture of an optical detector. The ﬁrst waveplate is used when
the polarization of the incident beam is required to be varied. The
Glan–Thompson polarizer is used in conjunction with the second
waveplate to rotate the plane of polarization of the light. The
detector system is designed to measure optical power over a wide
dynamic range as shown in Fig. 1(a). The three solid angle limiting
apertures (A) (0.1, 1.0, and 7mm in diameter) are designed to
optimize the required angular sensitivity and collection efﬁciency.
A lens is positioned behind the apertures to focus the sample
plane onto a manually adjustable iris. The second WP is mounted
on a computer controlled rotation stage, and a POL is mounted on
a manual rotary stage following the WP. During measurement, all
the POLs remain ﬁxed. After passing through the iris, the incident
ray is collected in an integrating sphere (IS). The IS consists of two
parts including two detectors, a silicon photodiode (SPD,
Hamamatsus S1336), and a photomultiplier tube (PMT,
Hamamatsus H9306). The PMT has a manual shutter (S) to
avoid excessive exposure of light power. The signals of the
scattering light from either the SPD or the PMT are recorded by a
lock-in ampliﬁer (Stanford Researchs SR830). The position of the
manual shutter S can be adjusted from 3 to 30mm to control the
ﬁeld of view of the sample, and is typically positioned at 10mm.
The power of the laser source is controlled to avoid physical
damage of the samples and surroundings.
The rotary mechanism of the goniometer provides the
necessary positioning of the sample with respect to the stationary
light source to deﬁne the angle of incidence. The detector can also
be manipulated with respect to the sample normal to deﬁne the
detection direction. The rotation of the receiver arm with respect
to the sample is independent of sample rotations. Fig. 2 shows a
schematic diagram of the goniometer. It consists of a three-axis
four-angle goniometer with 4 rotation angles a, b, g, and d. The
angle a is deﬁned as the rotation angle of the sample with respect
to a vertical axis. The angle b is deﬁned as the rotation angle of the
sample with respect to a horizontal axis that moves with a. The
angle g is deﬁned as the rotation angle of the sample azimuth that
moves with a and b. The angle d is deﬁned as the rotation angle of

wavelength [15], is adopted here with the assumption that the
nanoparticles are isolated and interaction between particles is
negligible [18]. The exact Mie solution is used to include the
diffraction of the scattered ﬁeld by a homogeneous PSL particle in
free space [1,3].
5. Sample preparations
A method to produce particulate contamination standards has
been developed in CMS of ITRI. These particulate contamination
standards, used to calibrate instruments that are used for
detecting size and numbers of particles on the surface of silicon
wafers, were produced using a differential mobility analyzer
(DMA) to deposit monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) particles
onto silicon bare and thin ﬁlm wafers. PSL particles ranging from
100 to 300nm in diameter were selected and deposited on bare
and thin ﬁlm wafers. The mean diameters of the PSL nanoparti-
cles, obtained from JSR Corporation, are speciﬁed as 10073,
20275, and 30979nm. The SiO2 ﬁlms with nominal thickness of
t=2nm, 5nm, and 10nm are prepared by thermal oxidation
methods at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
Limited (TSMC). The ﬁlm thicknesses are determined using
grazing incidence X-ray reﬂectometer (GIXRR) at CMS of ITRI.
The GIXRR measurement system (PANalytical X’Pert PRO MRD)
consists of an X-ray tube, a goniometer, collimators, and a
detector. An X-ray beam is incident on the surface of the thin
ﬁlms at grazing angle to obtain the external total reﬂection owing
to the index difference of the thin ﬁlm and the substrate. The
standard deviation of the ﬁlm thickness is about 0.03nm,
estimated from multiple measurements and statistical data
analysis, at 95% conﬁdence level [19]. The uniformity across the
wafer of the ﬁlm thickness of the wafer coated with a ﬁlm of 5nm
thickness was tested by GIXRR. Each wafer was divided into 29
segments and the thickness of each area was measured. The
means of the 3 measurements for each area are shown in Fig. 4.
The average of the ﬁlm thickness of the entire area is 5.45nmwith
standard deviation of 0.04nm. These results verify the uniformity
of ﬁlm thickness over the entire wafer. The surface roughness of
the ﬁlms was analyzed by atomic force microcopy (AFM, Digital
Instruments Nanoscope, DI 3100) and is shown in Fig. 5. As
indicated in Fig. 5, the roughnesses in areas around the particle
were well below 1nm: Rao1nm and Rqo1nm, where Ra is the
arithmetical mean deviation of the surface, and Rq the root-mean-
square deviation of the surface. The small roughness (less than 1%
of nominal nanoparticle diameter) shows that the measurement
of light scattering from nanoparticles was not affected by the
scattering from the ﬁlm roughness.
The size and distribution of particles deposited through the
low-pressure impactor can be selected by controlling the
concentration of PSL solution, the ﬂow rate of the aerosol and
the sheath air, and the DMA voltage. The AFM was used to
determine and conﬁrm the size of polystyrene spheres deposited
on wafers. Test samples of PSL nanoparticles of 100nm nominal
size on wafer were measured. A typical AFM image of such a
particle is shown in Fig. 5. For the 100nm nanoparticles, the
diameter obtained by AFM measurement for 10 randomly
selected nanoparticles was 104.65nm with standard deviation
of 2.82nm. The overall scattering intensity from the thin ﬁlm
coated samples with the PSL spheres is about two orders of
magnitude stronger than the light scattered from the thin ﬁlm
coated samples without the PSL spheres. Hence, light scattering
from the roughness of the ﬁlm in the sphere/ﬁlm/silicon wafer
system is considered to be negligible. The particle densities used
in this study are low enough that direct particle–particle
interactions can be ignored. The design and evaluation of the
low-pressure impactor and the particle generation/classiﬁcation
system have been described in detail elsewhere [20].
6. Bidirectional ellipsometric measurements
The general transformation of the polarimetric properties of
light as a result of its linear interaction with an optical material
can be described by Stokes vectors and the Mueller matrix [2].
Previous studies have demonstrated that speciﬁc incident polar-
izations are particularly useful for distinguishing different sources
of scatter near a surface [9–13]. Bidirectional ellipsometry (BE)
parameters have been found to be particularly valuable to present
the measurement results. The polarization state of the incident
light is selected with a ﬁxed linear polarizer followed by a rotating
l/2 linear retarder. The polarization state of the scattered light is
analyzed with a rotating linear retarder followed by a ﬁxed linear
polarizer. The scattering measurement performed in this paper
considered only linear polarized lights. As a result, the fourth row
and column of the Muller matrix can be ignored. Additionally, the
use of 33 upper left-hand corner of the Mueller matrix provides
advantages to reduce the number of parameters being sought in
the measurement and to reduce the large uncertainties, which
may be observed when using the full 44 Mueller matrix. In
order to obtain the 33 upper left-hand corner of the Mueller
matrix, ao:4o scheme was illustrated [12] as the receiving
retarder was rotated at four times the angle of the incident light
retarder. Thus, measurement signals were obtained at 16 evenly
spaced intervals, and processed through the Fourier transform for
the 9 elements of the 33 non-handed Mueller matrix [21].
Measurements of the full Mueller matrix are described in detail
elsewhere [22,23] and will not be repeated in this paper. The
Mueller matrix was then measured as a function of the azimuthal
scattering angle fr. In this geometry, the probed scattering
directions mapped out a cone in space, beginning in the specular
direction for fr=01 and ending in the retroreﬂection direction for
fr=1801, and all of the measured scattering directions were out of
plane of the incidence angle.
