英文摘要: 
The research of current project is to continue two years’ efforts. Experiments were performed from 
Wistar rats in which various degrees of burn injury were made on the dorsal skin of animals. A 50 MHz 
ultrasound system was developed and implemented to measure ultrasonic signals backscattered from the 
burned skin tissues. Various burn degrees were achieved by placing a 100oC brass plate onto the dorsal skins 
of anesthetized rats for various durations ranged from 5 to 20 s. The burn degrees were correlated to ultrasonic 
parameters, including integrated backscatter (IB) and Nakagami parameter (m) calculated from ultrasonic 
signals acquired from the burned tissues of a 5 × 1.4 mm (width × depth) area. Results demonstrated that both 
IB and m decreased exponentially with the increase of burn degree. Specifically, the IB of –158.14.9 (mean ± 
standard deviation) dB for the normal skin tissues tended to decrease to –187.92.5 dB for those been burned 
for 20 s; while the corresponding Nakagami parameters tended to decrease from 0.760.08 to 0.450.04, 
respectively. The variation of both IB and Nakagami parameter was partially associated with the change of 
collagen fibers properties from the burned tissues verified by samples of tissue histological sections. 
Particularly, the m parameter may be more sensitive to differentiate the burned skin due to it has a greater rate 
of change with respect to different burn durations. These ultrasonic parameters in conjunction with high 
frequency B-mode and Nakagami images could have a potential to assess the burn degree quantitatively. 
 
Keywords: burn degree, ultrasonic backscattering, integrated backscatter, Nakagami parameter 
 
前言 
Burn is a common injury frequently caused by several accidents associated with heat, electricity, 
chemicals, radiation, or friction. The burn was categorized into different degrees according to burn depths in 
the tissues of superficial (first-degree), superficial-partial (second-degree), deep-partial (second-degree), and 
 4 
 
(Huang et al., 2009), and small animals (Sun et al., 2007). High frequency ultrasound was not only capable of 
imaging cutaneous tissues readily, but also able to further characterize properties of the skin by ultrasonic 
parameters. The attenuation coefficient slope is an example for characterizing properties of the skins from 
young and old human using a 40 MHz ultrasound (Guittet et al., 1999). Specifically, the slope of 
frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient of the skin tissue was found to decrease with advancing age and 
that was suggested to be relevant to structural modifications in the human dermis. Using a 20 MHz ultrasound, 
another measurement was performed from the dermis of healthy subjects and that the progressive or 
pathologic changes in the dermis may be feasibly detected using ultrasonic integrated backscatter (IB) and 
ultrasound frequency dependence property (Fournier et al., 2001). Moreover, probability distributions of 
backscattered envelopes measured from in vivo normal human dermis and subcutaneous fat were investigated 
(Raju and Srinivasan, 2002). The discrepancy was found from that ultrasonic signals backscattered from 
subcutaneous fat tended to distribute as pre-Rayleigh behavior more than those of from the dermis. Signals 
acquired from the dermis in the forearm and fingertip regions tended to behave differently as assessed by the 
generalized Gamma distribution. Raju et al. moreover measured thickness, echogenicity, attenuation 
coefficient slope, and parameters corresponding to statistics of echo signals from allergic and irritant contact 
dermatitis of the skin tissues using a 33 MHz ultrasound (Raju et al., 2003). They concluded that a 
combination of those quantitative ultrasonic parameters could be potentially applied for characterizing contact 
dermatitis. Another ultrasonic characterization of the skin fibrosis was carried out using IB and 
frequency-dependent attenuation slope measured by a 20 MHz ultrasound (Huang et al., 2007c). In 
accordance with the increase of fibrotic contents of the skin tissue, both IB and frequency-dependent 
attenuation slope tended to decrease; whereas that the skin thickness and integrated attenuation were increased 
accordingly. 
Other than typical ultrasonic pulse-echo images and acoustical parameters been used to estimate the 
depth of necrotic tissue in previous studies, the statistical distributions of backscattered signals capable of 
sensitively reflecting changes of local and fine structure in tissues have been rarely applied to characterize 
burnt tissues. The statistical analysis of ultrasonic signals thus provides another means for correlating the 
variation of echo strengths with structure or pathological states in tissues. To date, several statistical models, 
including Rayleigh (Burckhardt, 1978), Rician (Wagner et al., 1987), K (Weng et al., 1991), homodyned K 
(Dutt and Greenleaf, 1994), generalized K (Shankar, 1995), and Nakagami (Shankar, 2000) distributions, had 
been utilized for tissue characterization. Besides Nakagami distribution, most of those just mentioned models 
are either short of a broad capability to fit all features of signals received from various tissues or with the 
nature of computational complications in parameter estimations, and that certainly tend to limit their practical 
applications in clinical diagnosis (Tsui and Chang, 2007). Nakagami distribution is a general model capable of 
covering all scattering conditions, including pre-Rayleigh, Rayleigh and post-Rayleigh distributions, 
encountered in medical ultrasound. The Backscattered envelope tends to conform to pre-Rayleigh distribution 
with Nakagami parameter smaller than 1 indicating that scatterers in the resolution cell are with randomly 
varying scattering cross-sections and comparatively high degree of variance. If the resolution cell contains a 
large number of randomly distributed scatterers, the corresponding statistics envelope will approach to 
Rayleigh distribution with Nakagami parameter equal to 1. While the resolution cell contains 
periodically-located scatterers (or a high concentration of scatterers presented locally) in addition to 
 6 
 
couple the transducer for transmission and reception of high frequency ultrasound. The distance between 
transducer and skin was adjusted to be approximately 5.7 mm subjected to transducer’s focus zone. The 
schematic diagram of high frequency ultrasound system is shown in Fig. 1, which mainly comprises a 50 
MHz single-element ultrasound transducer with -6 dB bandwidth of 35 MHz (NIH Ultrasonic Transducer 
Resource Center, USC, LA, USA), pulser/receiver (Model 5900PR, Panametrics, Waltham, MA, USA), stage 
positioners (Model SGSP26-200, SIGMA KOKI, Japan) and controller (Model CSG-602R, SIGAM KOKI, 
Japan), and a 8-bit analog-to-digital converter (Model PDA500, Signatec Inc., CA, USA). The characteristics 
and pulse-echo response of the transducer are respectively given in Table I and Fig. 2. The swept-scan 
imaging was implemented by moving the transducer linearly with the step resolution of 2 μm. Echo radio 
frequency (RF) signals were filtered with a bandpass filter (Model BIF-50, Mini-Circuits, Brooklyn, NY, USA) 
and then digitized before data acquisition. Signal processing algorithms including envelope detection of echo 
signals and logarithmic compression of the RF data were developed. The whole data acquisition system was 
synchronized with movements of motor stage controlled by LabVIEW software (National Instruments, TX, 
USA). The resolution of B-mode image was measured from a 10 μm tungsten wire. The approximate -6 dB 
axial and lateral resolution of the B-mode images are 25 and 50 μm, respectively. Each acquired B-mode 
image with the size of 5 mm × 1.4 mm is composed of 500 A-lines at a 10 μm interval. 
 
Ultrasonic parameters analysis 
Ultrasonic backscattered signals was well known to correspond to microstructure and scatterer properties, 
such as shape, size, concentration, density, and other elastic properties, in biological tissues (Wang and Shung, 
1997, 2001). IB and Nakagami parameter were calculated to further quantify the ultrasonic signals 
backscattered from the skin tissues. The IB, frequently adopted to quantify strengths of ultrasonic 
backscattered signals, is defined as the frequency average of the backscattering transfer function of a sample 
volume over the transducer’s bandwidth normalized relative to that from a flat reflector. The IB may be 
calculated from the following equation (Huang and Wang, 2007a),

spectrum and those of Sr(f) and Sref(f) represent the spectra of backscattered signals obtained from the tissue 
and that of an echo received from a stainless steel reflector, respectively. 
Depending on the complexity and compositions of a biological tissue, the distribution of ultrasonic 
backscattered strengths might accordingly exhibit to various probability density function (PDF). This enables 
the feature of statistical distribution of the ultrasonic backscattered envelope to be correlated to tissue 
properties, such as scatterer concentration and arrangement, for further applications in tissue characterization. 
Among other statistical models, Nakagami distribution is a general statistical model with relatively less 
computational complications and has demonstrated to be feasible for characterizing ultrasonic signals 
backscattered from biological tissues (Tsui et al., 2007). The PDF of Nakagami distribution, f(R), of the 
ultrasonic backscattered envelope (R) is given by (Huang and Wang, 2007b),

Fig. 3 shows a series of rat skin photographs associated with various burn degrees resultant from 
different burn durations ranged from 0 to 20 s, in which 0 s refers to the normal uninjured skin as control 
group. In comparison with the color of normal skin, the burned skins tend to vary progressively from light to 
dark-red colors corresponding to the increase of burn durations. Fig. 4 is a series of corresponding B-mode 
images of the skin, in which the width of heated brass plate is indicated by a pair of yellow arrows. The 
corresponding echogenicity of B-mode images from the lesion site in the dermis tends to decrease slightly 
along with the increase of burn duration. It also can readily discern difference between burnt and normal 
tissues in terms of the texture features of B-mode images, in which the image of normal tissue appears to be 
more homogeneous and less attenuated than those of burnt tissues. 
To further quantitatively assess the burn injuries, the averaged of ultrasonic integrated backscatter, 
denoted as IB , was calculated from each A-line within a ROI of burnt and normal tissues. IB  tended to 
decrease from –158.14.9 to –187.92.5 dB in accordance with the increase of burn durations from 0 to 20 s, 
shown in Fig. 5. It reveals that the dependence of IB  as a function of burn duration was exponentially 
correlated with correlation coefficient of 0.87 from the curve fitting result. The Nakagami images were shown 
in Fig. 6 which can be readily correlated to those B-mode images in Fig. 4. Other than features in B-images, 
the Nakagami images can fairly differentiate the interface between the skin and the injured dermis, as shown 
in Fig. 6(b)–(e). The interfaces, appear to be as a line shape in dark-blue color, were distributed with relatively 
small m-parameters. As the burn duration was increased, the Nakagami images resulted more dark-blue 
shading in the area of dermis along with the depth direction of the skin. The wm  were calculated from the 
same ROI as those of in Fig 4(a). Fig. 7 is wm  as a function of burn duration, in which wm  decreased from 
0.760.08 to 0.450.04 corresponding to the increase of burn duration from 0 to 20 s. The statistical analyses 
of both IB  and wm  were shown in Table II. Both IB  and wm  differed significantly between normal and 
burned skins of various burn durations ( IB : p = 0.002 and wm : p = 0.001). The IB  of the skins been burned 
for 5 s duration was significantly larger than those for 10 s (p = 0.031). The wm  differed significantly 
between the skins been burned for 15 s duration and those for either 10 (p = 0.026) or 20 s (p = 0.045).  
Fig. 8 are microscopic histological sections able to show local structures of the dermis, in which tissues 
were from the rat skin with the H&E-stain. The collagen fibers of the normal skin, shown in Fig. 8(a), tended 
to homogeneously distribute in the dermis, indicated as black arrows. In accordance with the increase of burn 
duration to generate different burn degrees, the collagen fibers were destructed and that the morphological 
features of histological sections were also changed, indicated as hollow arrows in Fig. 8(b)-(e). Specifically, 
the burn depths respectively increased from 28858 to 65451 μm with the increase of burn durations from 5 
 10 
 
fluid content associated with the increase of burn duration (Brink et al., 1986; Despa et al., 2005) that 
primarily lead to the decrease of ultrasonic backscattering strengths for burned tissues.  
Though high frequency B-mode ultrasound image may provide promising structure information, the gray 
scale and quality of these images are easily affected by several system factors, such as the system gain, 
time-gain compensation, and dynamic range settings. Therefore, the IB calculated from RF signals tends to 
preserve original strength and frequency contents of ultrasonic echoes for better quantitatively assessing the 
burn degree. Moreover, the m parameter estimated from the PDF of ultrasonic backscattered envelope and the 
Nakagami image implemented from signals of a local sliding window tended to be affected by system 
parameters minimally (Tsui et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 6, a fine region of dark-blue shading located at the 
front interface and the interface between the epidermis and dermis of the injured skin depicted the promising 
feature of Nakagami images. This phenomenon is partially due to the calculation of m parameter from signals 
resided in a sliding window that covers signals not only from the skin surface but also from those of saline or 
denatured dermis. Due to echoes obtained from the cutaneous surface are much stronger than those of from 
the saline and injured dermis, the corresponding statistical distribution of backscattered envelopes tends to be 
significantly pre-Rayleigh distributed resultant from small m parameters that lead to the dark-blue shading in 
the Nakagami image (Tsui et al., 2007). The dark-blue shading could be applied to estimate lateral range near 
surface of the burn skin. Due to the intensity of ultrasonic backscatter signals for normal skin were larger 
significantly than those for burn skin, the dark-blue shading were feasible to be created to estimate lateral 
extend of burn region. The wm  of normal dermis, in Fig. 7, is smaller than 1 indicating that the PDF of 
corresponding backscatter envelope to be pre-Rayleigh distributed, in which these results are consistent with 
those of previously reported data (Raju and Srinivasan, 2002). In the histology viewpoint, it is partially due to 
collagen fibers of the normal dermis are comprised of small fibrils and microfibrils, all of which constitute 
ranging from tens of microns to tens of angstroms in size (Raju and Srinivasan, 2002). Therefore, the effective 
scatterers in each resolution cell of the incident ultrasound lead scattering cross-sections to vary randomly 
with a comparatively high degree of variance and to distribute as pre-Rayleigh statistics. Moreover, the 
increase of temperature along the depth of skin with the increase of burn duration may result in the increase of 
shrinkage and coagulation of collagen fibers. Subsequently, the variance of scattering cross-sections raises to 
cause the PDF of backscattering envelope to represent more apparent pre-Rayleigh distribution associated 
with the decrease of wm  (see Fig. 7). 
The kinetics of thermal damage on biomolecular structures depends on multiple factors and that in 
general leads the burn injury degree as a function of burn duration to be described by an exponential 
relationship (Despa et al., 2005). This tendency is consistent with IB  and wm  results in this study. In 
mathematical viewpoint, the m parameter has some advantages over IB parameter to be easily applied to tissue 
characterization. First, m parameter calculates in time domain to have more estimative efficiency. Second, 
estimation using m parameter does not need the reference signals to calibrate the characteristics of transducer. 
Nevertheless, according to the results of statistical analyses, wm  did not have significant difference to

(英文) Detection of Kinetic Information in the Wrist Using  
      High-Frequency Ultrasound

CTS is usually diagnosed by the electrophysiology. Therefore, symptoms such as numbness, burning pain, 
and paresthesia in the distribution of the median nerve can be detected [2, 3]. However, due to complications 
tangled with other nerve entrapments or diseases, the electrophysiological diagnosis frequently results the 
false negative rate to be between 10 to 20% approximately [1]. Hence, it would be essential if there is a means 
able to provide a direct kinetic information associated with the median nerve and surrounding tissues in the 
wrist and to increase the accuracy of diagnosis. 
Medical imaging provides a non-invasive modality to examine internal structures of a tissue. Among those 
imaging modalities, ultrasound image with advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, real time imaging, high 
spatial resolution, and free of radiation, could be substantially applied to measure kinetic information in the 
wrist for diagnosing the CTS [4, 5]. The diagnosis with ultrasound images generally involves in the 
calculations of cross-sectional area and area flattening ratio of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel and 
that of the displacement of the flexor retinaculum [6]. In addition to imaging the morphological structures in 
the wrist, the kinetic information could also reveal conditions for assessing CTS. Yet, most of current clinical 
ultrasound scanners are with frequencies between 1 to 10 MHz that the resolution of which was not able to 
provide a substantial sensitivity and quantitative information for the diagnosis. This hurdle could be improved 
by the employment of high-frequency, above 20 MHz, ultrasound (HFU). With the improvement of resolution, 
HFU images have been utilized to measure the skin, the eye, vocal folds, vasculature, blood, and small 
animals [7-13]. The accompanying attenuation, on the other hand, may largely limits the depth of HFU 
penetration. 
In this study, a 30 MHz high-frequency ultrasound system was applied to measure morphology of the 
median nerve and the kinetic information of the wrist associated with movements of fingers from extended to 
flexed positions. The synthetic aperture focusing technique was implemented was utilized to increase the 
depth of image penetration. The correlation coefficient between two consecutive images was calculated for 
detecting variation of a tissue in region of interest. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
High frequency ultrasound imaging system 
The schematic diagram of a developed HFU system is shown in Fig. 1. The imaging of HFU system is 
achieved by translating a 30 MHz single element ultrasound transducer (NIH Ultrasonic Transducer Resource 
Center, USC, LA, CA, USA) linearly via a x-y-z motor stage that comprises of an axis of piezoceramic motor 
(HR8, Nanomotion Ltd., Yokneam, Israel) and two other axes of servo motors (CM1-C-17L30A, Cool 
Muscle, Japan) controlled by a motor controller (DMC-1842, Galil motion control Inc., CA, USA). The 
transducer was driven by a high-voltage monocycle generator (AVB2-TB-C, AVTECH Electrosystems

where p(k,t) is the spectrum of the delayed scan-line data along the scan direction, k is the spatial frequency 
index, and M0 is zero means at low frequency range [14]. After each acquired RF signals were processed with 
adaptive weighting SAFT, the envelope detection and logarithmic compression were applied for image 
formation. The motion tracking was implemented by the correlation coefficient (　) between two consecutive 
images, as following [7],

 where N denotes number of signal points, E1={e1(0),e1(1),…,e1(i),…,e1(N-1)} and E2={e2(0),e2(1),…, 
e2(i) ,…,e2(N-1)} represent signals from two consecutive images, respectively. The imaging formation and 
data analysis were implemented on a personal computer using MATLAB software (The MathWorks, MA, 
USA).  
Experimental arrangement 
In vivo experiments were carried out from the right wrist of each healthy volunteer, shown in Fig. 2. 
Measurements were performed in a water tank filled with degassed water, where the distance between the 
surface of the skin and transducer was adjusted to be approximately 6 mm. HFU

images were subsequently collected from the wrist covering the movements of fingers from extended to 
flexed at different angles. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A typical HFU image of the wrist is shown in Fig. 3, in which the anatomical structure of median nerve and 
flexor tendon are clearly discerned. The size of median nerve was estimated to be 6.32 ± 0.33 mm2, which is
