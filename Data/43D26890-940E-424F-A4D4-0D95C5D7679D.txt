and optimization technique, the Young’s modulus 
and Poisson’s ratio of the membrane can be 
determined through the inverse approach. In order 
to measure the out-of-plane displacement field, 
two sets of DIC images which were taken from 
two different view positions were required. The 
commercial software ANSYS was adopted for 
performing FEM analysis, the commercial 
software RapidCorrelator was adopted and the 
Hooke-Jeeves, Rosenbrock and Nowton-Raphson 
method [13] were used for optimization search. 
 
2.2 Three-Dimensional Displacement Fields 
Determination 
Let V be an arbitrary particle on the surface 
of an un-deformed body and V’ is the 
corresponding position of the particle V after the 
body was deformed as shown in the Figure 2. In 
the Figure 2, du0, dv0, and dw0 are the X-,Y-,and 
Z-component, respectively, of the displacement 
vector of the particle V. By setting a CCD camera 
in front of the body with the axis of the camera 
perpendicular to the X-Y plane, du0 and dv0 can be 
determined by using DIC technique [4-6]. 
However, dw0 can not be obtained easily by using 
conventional DIC technique. 
In order to measure the out-of-plane 
displacement field, it is necessarily to take two 
sets of DIC images from two different view 
positions as shown in the Figure 3. The angle 
between the axes of the CCD camera at two 
different positions is defined as θ and the angle 
between the Z0-axis and the axis of the CCD 
camera at position B is defined as ρ Position A 
and position B are located at the same X-Z 
plane.Let X1-Y1-Z1 be a coordinate system rotated 
(θ – ρ) counterclockwise around Y-axis and 
X2-Y2-Z2 is a coordinate system rotated ρ 
clockwise around Y-axis. It is noted that Y1-axis 
and Y2-axis coincide with Y0-axis, also, Z1-axis 
and Z2-axis coincide with the axes of the CCD 
camera at position A and position B, respectively. 
Let (du1, dv1, dw1) and (du2, dv2, dw2) be defined 
as the X1-,Y1-, Z1-component and X2-,Y2-, 
Z2-component, respectively, of the displacement 
vector of the particle V.  
By utilizing the DIC technique, (du1, dv1) and 
(du2, dv2) can be obtained from the images taken 
by the CCD cameras at position A and position B, 
respectively. It should be noted that dv1 = dv2 = 
dv0 since position A and position B are located at 
the same X-Z plane. Then the values of du0 and 
dw0 can be determined from the values of du1 and 
du2 by as shown in the following. 
Figure 4. shows X-Z projection of the 
displacement vector of the particle, where Vxz and 
Vxz’ are the projections of V and V’, respectively, 
on the X-Z plane. By using the vector components 
transformation rule, one can write 
du = (du1)(cosρ) - (dw1)(sinρ)                            (1) 
dw = (du1)(sinρ) + (dw1)(cosρ)                          (2) 
du1 = (du2)(cosθ) + (dw2)(sinθ)                          (3) 
dw1 = - (du2)(sinθ) +(dw2)(cosθ)                       (4) 
Solving the simultaneous equations (1) to (4), 
du and dv can be expressed as  
du=(du2)(cosρ)+[du1-(du2)(cosθ)](sinρ/sinθ)     (5) 
dw=-(du2)(sinρ)+[du1-(du2)(cosθ)](cosρ/sinθ) (6) 
Therefore, by using equations (5) and (6), the 
values of du0 and dw0 can be determined from the 
values of du1 and du2. If 1 cm of image contains 
400 pixels, one can show that the minimum 
in-plane and out-of-plane displacements which 
can be detected by the proposed technique are 
about 5 μm and 20 μm, respectively, and the 
precision error is about ± 0.5 μm. 
 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND 
DISCUSSIONS 
3.1 Experiment for Validity 
In order to test the validity of equations (5) 
 4
chosen to determine the Young’s modulus, E, and 
Poisson’s ratio, ν, of the membrane by using the 
proposed method shown in the Figure 1.  The 
coordinates of points dwa, dwb, dwc, dwd and dwe 
are (7, 0, 0) mm, (9, 0, 0) mm, (11, 0, 0) mm, (13, 
0, 0) mm, and (15, 0, 0) mm, respectively. Table 3 
shows the DIC experimental results. 
For any given values of E and ν, the 
out-of-plane displacements of points dwa, dwb, 
dwc, dwd and dwe, can be obtained by using FEM 
also. By setting the three points and five points 
objective function, F(E,ν), as 
F(E,ν) = (dwa - dwa’)2 + (dwb - dwb’)2 +  
(dwc - dwc’)2                     (7) 
F(E,ν) = (dwa-dwa’)2 + (dwb- dwb’)2 + (dwc- dwc)2 
+ (dwd - dwd’)2 + (dwe - dwe’)2     (8) 
The actual values of Young’s modulus, En, 
and Poisson’s ratio, νn, of the membrane can be 
determined through the flow chart shown in the 
Figure 1. The three point out-of-plane 
displacement fields were compared with the five 
point out-of-plane displacement fields. 
In the FEM analysis, element shell63 and 
contact element was chosen and the total number 
of elements and nodes were 540 and 598, 
respectively in the Figure 15. Hooke-Jeeves and 
Rosenbrock method were the chosen optimization 
technique with initial E0 = 70 GPa, ν0 = 0.30 and 
end conditions Eε = 2.5 GPa, νε = 2.5 × 10-2 . 
Nowton-Raphson method was the chosen 
optimization technique with initial E0 = 45 GPa, 
ν0 = 0.20 and end conditions Eε = 0.1 GPa, 
νε = 0.01. The table 4, 5 and 6 show results of 
equation (7) and (8). The table 7 shows calculating 
result of Young’s modulus and Possion’s ratio of 
the membrane. 
The Young’s modulus of the membrane was 
determined by using nano-indentor also and the 
membrane was experimented five points. By 
assuming ν = 0.18, 0.25 and 0.35 the obtained 
value of Young’s modulus was shown in the Table 
8. The three point error values seem less than five 
point values according to the Table 4, 5 and 6. But 
the five point Young’s modulus is better than three 
point Young’s modulus according to the Table 7 
compare with the Table 8. It is note when the more 
points or different optimization techniques can not 
convergence of Possion’s ratio according to the 
Table 7. 
The Young’s modulus are 41.6 ~ 45 GPa of 
DIC and 38.1 ~ 43.4 GPa of the nano-indentor 
according to 7. By comparing the result obtained 
from the proposed approach with the result 
obtained from the nano-indentor, the error was 9.1 
~ 3.6 %. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, in order to measure the 
out-of-plane displacement field, a simpler formula 
for calculating DIC three-dimensional 
displacement field was developed by using the 
concept of coordinate transformation. The 
experimental results showed that less than 8% 
error can be obtained. By combining the measured 
displacement fields, finite element method, and 
optimization technique, the Young’s modulus and 
Poisson’s ratio of a membrane can be determined 
through the inverse approach. By comparing the 
result obtained from the proposed approach with 
the result obtained from the nano-indentor, the 
error was within 10%. However, the 
corresponding cost of the proposed approach was 
much lower than the corresponding cost of the 
nano-indentor.
