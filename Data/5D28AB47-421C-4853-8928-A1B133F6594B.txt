Introduction
In construction industry, joint ventures (JVs) have become one of the major organizational
forms utilized in large-scale projects and been considered one of the major entry modes for
international markets. Due to the recent trend of using construction JVs (CJVs), major
construction firms are faced with various challenging issues in managing JVs. Among these
issues, the choices of governance structures have a profound impact on the JV success.
In their pilot study of the organizational governance structure choices in CJVs, Ho et al.
(2008) identified two major organizational control structures and developed a conceptual
framework for governance structure decisions. In addition to a critical literature review in both
management and construction disciplines, they have also conducted a qualitative empirical
study in evaluating their model. According to Ho et al. (2008), two distinctive organizational
forms, focusing on the control aspect of governance, are identified and defined for CJVs:
Jointly Managed JVs (JMJ) and Separately Managed JVs (SMJ). In JMJ, all partners jointly
share profits and risks and the JV officers make most of the decisions, which will be followed
by all partners. Plus, close coordination and frequent communications are extended to all
levels of a JV organization. On the contrary, in SMJ, a project is divided into a few distinctive
subtasks and each partner is primarily responsible, technically and/or financially, for its
assigned tasks and makes decisions directly without the formal consent from other partners.
The terms “Integrated JVs” and “Non-integrated JVs” are also found in construction practice
and literature (Chen, 2005) to describe two different modes of governance structures.
3三. 文獻探討
The Governance Structure Model and Propositions to be Tested
Theoretic Background of the Model Development
Ho et al. (2008) argue that an integrated framework fusing traditional Transaction Cost
Economics (TCE) and recent Resource-Based View (RBV) can provide a more comprehensive
explanation of the governance structure choices in CJVs. According to TCE, optimal governance
forms should minimize transaction overheads as well as the costs of exchange arising from
uncertainty and asset specificity (Williamson, 1985; Matthews, 1986). Proponents of TCE argue
that the choice of organizational governance form is affected by various transaction costs, such as
information cost, contracting cost, and monitoring and enforcing cost. Particularly, contractual
hazards, such as environmental and behavioral uncertainties imbued in transactional exchange,
are the main sources of transaction costs and the key determinants of how firms should enter into
a collaborative relationship (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1975, 1985).
While contractual hazards are thought to shape governance choices, they are not the only
factors that stand to influence the governance decisions. In addition to the impacts of transaction
costs, TCE scholars have gradually recognized the potential of the influence of firm capabilities
on governance modes (Argyres, 1996; Leiblein and Miller, 2003; Mayer, 2006; Nickerson and
Silverman, 2003; Nickerson and Zenger, 2002; Silverman, 1999).
In this regard, Ho et al. (2008) incorporated the resource-based view of organizational
control, which emphasizes value creation and sustainability of competitive advantages of a firm
5administrative practices, employee expectations, and interpretation of and response to strategic
issues (Park and Ungson, 1997). The rationale underlying this proposition is that, through limited
inter-dependence between partners, the SMJ structure helps to reduce the transaction costs caused
by the culture-associated management problems. On the other hand, a low level of cultural
difference provides a better environment for adopting the JMJ structure.
Proposition 2: A CJV with greater trust among partners is more likely to adopt JMJ, while
partners with less trust among them will tend to adopt SMJ.
Trust is built upon an expectation that one partner has for another in the partnership such
that their interaction is predictable and the behavior and responses are mutually acceptable to one
another (Harrigan, 1985). Based on the broader view of transaction costs (Matthews, 1986),
higher trust can reduce many transaction costs such as monitoring, outcome verification,
communication, etc, while the lack of trust among partners will cause major management
problems and subsequent transaction costs. Similar to the reasoning underlying the first
proposition, on the one hand, the use of SMJ structure may help to reduce transaction costs due to
distrust and, on the other hand, trust provides an appropriate environment for adopting the JMJ
structure.
Proposition 3: A CJV where partners have higher needs for procurement autonomy is more likely
to adopt SMJ, while a CJV with fewer needs from partners for procurement autonomy is more
likely to adopt JMJ.
In construction industry, the success of a contracting firm heavily lies in its capability to

Research Design and Methodology
Econometric Model for Testing Propositions
OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) multiple linear regression analysis was used to test our hypotheses.
OLS estimators are the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) (Wooldridge, 2003). However,
several regression diagnostics are needed to ensure that basic assumptions for OLS regression are
satisfied. In this study, White test (White, 1980) was performed to ensure that the sample met the
homoscedasticity assumption of the OLS regression. RESET test (Ramsey, 1969) was performed
to test specification errors such as omitted variables and non-linearity of functional form. The
empirical model designed to test Propositions One to Four is shown in equation (1), where the
first four regressors are control variables and the next four regressors are the hypothesized
determinants of governance structure choices. The dependent variable, JMJ Orientation, depicts
the degree of governance structure choice in a continuum from one extreme, the JMJ, to the other
extreme, the SMJ. Details concerning the regression variables will be given in later sections.
The empirical model is also depicted as shown in Fig. 1, where control variables are ignored.
JMJ Orientation =
Cb1Sizeb2Typeb3Nationalityb4 Experience
1Culture2Trust3 Pr ocurement4Learning
(1)
where C is the constant, b1 ~b4 and 1~4 are the regression coefficients and  is a random
disturbance. The first four regressors are project size, project type, foreign partner’s nationality, 
and cooperation experiences, respectively, and the last four regressors are the governance
structure determinants in Propositions One to Four, respectively.
To test each proposition, we evaluate the data against its null hypothesis that the
9project owners between March 2006 and December 2006, along with relevant literature review,
we designed and pre-tested a questionnaire including all constructs of interest for measuring the
model variables.
The questionnaires were then mailed to project managers of all partners in the
aforementioned CJVs, including 97 CJVs in Taipei Metro project, 9 in Kaohsiung MRT project,
17 in Taiwan High Speed Rail project, and 5 in others. Two weeks later, a second copy of the
survey was sent to the nonrespondents, along with follow-up letters. Responses with missing data
or unclear or contradictory answers that could not be reconciled through follow-up telephone
calls were removed from the sample. This approach yielded a total of 54 CJV observations from
questionnaire replies, with a response rate of 42.2%.
The sample size and response rate are in line with other recent empirical studies, such as
Mohamed (2003) on the performance of international CJVs in different stages using samples
from Australia and UK. In our study, the CJVs that responded to the survey represented a broad
coverage of CJVs, ranging in size from $33 millions to $ 462 millions and including different
international participants, among which 40 of them from Japan, eight from France, two from
Germany, two from Korea, one from Thailand, and one from Holland-Germany.
Measures of Regression Variables
Dependent Variable: JMJ Orientation
According to Ho et al. (2008), although JMJ and SMJ represent two conceptually opposite and
11
ranking in OLS regressions deviates from the regression assumption of interval data, it is a
common practice in literature that ordinal variables measured in Likert scales are treated as
interval variables and can be analyzed in OLS regression models. For example, the work of
Parkhe (1993), Michel and Hambrick (1992), Keats and Hitt (1988) and several Monte Carlo
studies (e.g. Labovitz, 1970) have suggested that the use of Likert-scaled ordinal variables in
linear regressions is not a serious problem.
For each variable in the regression, we calculated the Cronbach’s alpha (α) as a measure of
internal scale consistency, indicated by an α of 0.7 or above (Nunnaly, 1978; Mohamed, 2003).
For this variable, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.76, according to our data.

Independent Variables
Cultural difference This variable was used to test the impact of cultural difference among
partners on the JMJ orientation, as specified in Proposition 1. According to Ho et al. (2008),
cultural distance often results in differences within their value systems and administrative

control. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for this variable was 0.78.
Motivation for learning This variable was used to test the Proposition 4. The motivation for
learning was measured by averaging evaluations of the following three questions: (1) Employees
from different partners were arranged to work together so as to facilitate learning; (2) The
partner(s) with advanced technology or more experiences would guide the other partner(s) in the
JV; (3) The partner(s) with weaker technology or less technology had strong motivation for
learning from the other partner(s). The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for this variable was 0.84.
Control Variables
In order to ensure that our hypothesized relationships were under better-controlled environments,
we included four variables to control for potential factors that might be correlated with the
hypothesized determinants or dependent variable. Project size was measured by the natural
logarithm of the contracted project costs, ranging from $33 millions to $462 millions. Project
type is a dummy variable, where ‘0’ indicated non-transportation projects and ‘1’ indicated 
transportation projects. Partner nationality is also a dummy variable, where ‘0’ indicatedthe JV
having non-Asian foreign partner(s) and ‘1’ indicated the JV having Asian foreign partner(s).
Experience of cooperation is a dummy variable, where ‘0’ indicated that the JV partners had no
prior experience of cooperation and ‘1’ indicated otherwise.

learning together explain 53% of the variation of governance structure choice.
Most importantly, Table 3 shows that all four propositions are strongly supported by the
small p-values less than either 1% or 5%, based on the more stringent Hetero-robust standard
errors for heteroscedasticity adjustment. Moreover, the sign of each coefficient is consistent with
that in each Proposition. Note that given a medium-sized sample, the statistical significance
shown in each coefficient indicates that the hypothesized relationships between the decisional
variables and the governance structure choices are strong and sample size in this study is not a
concern for causing problems. To conclude the hypothesis tests, our econometric analysis results
strongly support the four propositions proposed by Ho et al. (2008).

variables in regression models is to compare their coefficients, given that the coefficients are
significant.
According to the regression results of Model 2, the “motivation for learning”and“needs for
procurement autonomy” are the most influential governance structure determinants with
coefficients equal to 0.39 and -0.37, respectively.The “cultural difference” and “trust” are about 
equally important with coefficients equal to -0.32 and 0.32, respectively. Why is the determinant
“motivations for learning” relatively more important than others? In recent literature on JVs and
international collaboration, one construct that particularly catches our attention is the“learning
intent”of partners (Hamel, 1991; Hamel et al., 1989). According to Hamel et al. (1989), learning
intent is particularly important in determining the success or failure of international
collaborations when there is a competence gap or information gap between the two partners.
Therefore, the“learning”construct may overlap with other possible impacting factors and plays a
more critical role in governance structure choices.
However, even given the statistical evidence presented in this study, we believe that the
relative impacts of proposed variables on governance structure choices may still vary
significantly in each unique project and the statistical results here may not be directly applied to
every project. To practitioners, the value of Ho et al.’s model is to ofer a new perspective and a 
set of constructs to determine the governance structure in a CJV. Thus, it may be better off to
leave the relative efect of each factor for the practitioners’ judgment based on each project’s 
unique characteristics.
21
the consequence of governance structure choices/JMJ orientation. If the ownership structure is
the consequence, for example, taking a smaller ownership under SMJ because of some SMJ
attributes such as cultural difference and the lack of trust, the ownership may not be critical in
influencing or measuring the constructs of JMJ orientation. Because of the complexity of the
ownership structure concerns, the impact of ownership structure on governance structure choices
deserves a separate study and can be a great topic for future research.
Some Extensions Due to the Descriptive Statistics of Regression Variables
According to the statistics in Table 2, there are several interesting observations worth further
analysis. Although these observations are not directly related to empirical evidence, they provide
insights regarding the tested model and model’s application in practice. These insights are based
on logical conjectures or inferences of the data within the context of tested model, which can be
the topics for future studies.
First, if we take a two-standard deviation range for“JMJorientation”, most governance
structure choices will fall within 2.7 to 6.9 of seven-point Likert scales. That is, the near-extreme
structure toward JMJ is more likely to be chosen and the near-extreme structure toward SMJ is
almost impossible. One possible reason is that, because of the nature of CJVs, the complete
independence without sharing any resources among partners is almost impossible and may not
match the owner’s expectation. Therefore, practitioners who wish to apply the tested propositions
should be aware that even if SMJ is a preferred structure based on the model variables, they
should avoid being too close to an extreme side.

六. 結論
Conclusions
The organizational governance structure choices in CJVs are critical to the success of both JVs
and participating firms. This paper empirically tests a model for governance structure choices in
CJVs. An econometric analysis was conducted to statistically test the model. According to the
OLS regression results, we conclude that cultural difference, trust, procurement autonomy, and
learning together explain about 53% of the variation of governance structure choice. Most
importantly, all four model propositions are strongly supported and the sign of each coefficient is
also consistent with the sign hypothesized in each proposition.
The regression results also provide statistically the relative importance of model variables,
although we believe that the relative importance of model variables may still vary significantly in
each unique project, depending on particular environments or project characteristics. Future study
may consider employing case study as an exploratory method to search for other important
decisional variables for governance structure choices. Further econometric study can incorporate
the JV success into a model and include those CJVs from other emerging countries and developed
countries.

HHT method is capable of analyzing non-stationary, non-linear, stochastic data sets.  The 
HHT method has been used in many fields (aeronautic, biology, physics, medical 
research and others) as an efficient analytical tool to evaluate time-varying processes 
(Huang and Shen 2006; Huang and Pan 2006).  Furthermore, the time series analysis 
performed using the HHT method can be plotted on a time, energy, frequency diagram or 
spectrogram, which gives a clear picture of the frequency, non-linearity and varying trend 
of the data.  In addition, the HHT method can provide physical insights into the 
investigated processes through the analysis of data for longer term prediction, thus 
greatly facilitating water quality management. 
 
2 HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM METHOD 
 
The HHT couples two distinct analytical methods to decompose observed data into 
independent Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) by the Empirical Mode Decomposition 
method and to transform these time-dependant functions into time-frequency functions by 
the Hilbert Transform method (Huang et al. 1998).  The combination of the above two 
methods can filter out the noise of non-stationary signals and identify different varying 
scales of the observed data.  Each IMF represents the analyzed signal in a different scale, 
in a sort of complete, adaptive and almost orthogonal mode.  In the EMD process, a 
specific frequency can be imposed, and data of lower frequency compared to the base 
value are removed. The resulting IMF is almost mono-component and as a result, the 
instantaneous frequencies can be extrapolated for a signal that is originally nonlinear and 
nonstationary (Peng et al. 2005).  Furthermore, application of the HHT facilitates the 
derivation of the local energy from each instantaneous frequency, resulting in a spectrum 
that represents the original signal in the energy-frequency-time distribution. 
 
The Hilbert Transform is a technique that was originally developed to solve integral 
equations.  The Hilbert Transform of a real function or signal X(t) is obtained by 
convoluting with t!/1  as in Eq. 1.  The new function or time series can be interpreted 
physically as a new time series that has been shifted by a 90º angle from its original 
format (Hsu 2005).  In other words, the time series X(t) by integral transformation has 
The contribution of the Hilbert Huang Transform method is to precede the application of 
the Hilbert Transform with a decomposition of the entire data set into a set of band-
limited functions called the IMFs (Huang et al. 1998).  The EMD is a repeated “sifting” 
procedure that decomposes complicated functions into independent polynomial and 
sinusoidal components.  This techniques leads to the definition of classes of functions 
(IMFs) based on their local properties for which the instantaneous frequency can be 
defined everywhere (Huang et al. 1998).  
 
An IMF is defined as a time series that satisfies the following two characteristics: 
(i) The number of extrema and the number of zeros crossing differs at most by one. 
(ii) At any point the mean values of the envelopes defined by the smooth curves passing 
through all the local maxima and all the local minima respectively is zero.  
The original signal can be easily represented by Eq. 6 as the sum of the IMFs ck(t) and a 
residual  
     
 
Equation 6 can be transformed into Eq. 7 by taking the Hilbert Transform of IMFs ck(t) 
and using the analytical function form as expressed in Eq. 2.

in which Re{…} represents the real part of the function. Equation 7 allows for plotting of 
the amplitude and instantaneous frequency as function of time in a three dimensional plot. 
The frequency time distribution of the amplitude is called the Hilbert Spectrum, H(",t).

Fig. 1  Original times series of Chrysene concentration 
 
The Hilbert Spectrum of the time series for log transformed Chrysene concentrations 
after EMD is presented in Fig. 2 where the amplitude obtained using Eq. 3 is plotted 
against time (on the x-axis) and frequency (on the y-axis).  As is often the case in many 
practical applications, the  concentrations are not mono-component.  the amplitude of 
Chrysene concentrations is subject to more scattered and less frequent variations.  The 
domineering time scales for Chrysene are 0.003 Hz (yearly), 0.02Hz (bi-monthly) and 
0.04 Hz (monthly).  Most of the time, the time scale of 0.03 Hz exists while other 
characteristic time scales can be observed at different times of the monitoring period. 
 
The EMD method facilitates the separation of an original multi-component signal into 
scales of band-limited sub-signals for which the application of the Hilbert Transform 
yields a much clearer picture of the instantaneous frequency (Tsai and Franceschini 2007).  
It can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 how the original signal is composed of “coexisting 
superimposed mode of oscillation” (Huang et al. 2003; Huang and Attoh-Okine 2005).  It 
is also important to understand that differently from other methods (e.g. Fourier 
transform) the scales are not set a priori, but are derived from data.   
 
From the decomposition, it is evident that in each case the first few IMFs are 
representative of highly fluctuating values and may include noises introduced in the 
sampling and handling procedure related to the measurement of the concentrations.  The 
important information that can easily be gained from the EMD is the predominant trend 
in the time series once noise, seasonality and influence by external factors have been 
removed by filtering of the corresponding frequency.  This trend is easily recognizable in 
the plot of the residual function, as shown in Figure 3. The predominant trend is 
decreasing for Chrysene. 
 
4 CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
Application of a state-of-the-art technique, the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) method, 
for the analysis of non-stationary and non-linear time series is proposed in this paper.   It 
has been demonstrated in this paper that use of the HHT method enables the analysis of 
nonlinear and non-stationary data, without the need for local assumptions.  In fact, the 
scales into which the dataset is decomposed are not set a priori, but derived from the data 
based on the local properties of the time series.  Thus, application of the EMD method 
enables the identification of the instantaneous frequency and local amplitude that can 
easily be represented in the 3-D space of Hilbert spectra.   
 
In this paper, a novel application of the Hilbert-Huang Transform method is proposed in 
the analysis of the Chrysene time series.  The combination of the EMD and Hilbert 
Transform can filter out the noise of non-stationary signals and identifies different 
varying time scales of the observed data.  The usefulness of the IMFs is twofold: (1) they 
can provide insights into the physical characteristics of the analyzed system and (2) they 
can be used as the basis for the simulation and forecast of the original non-stationary and 
non-linear signal.  It is shown that the EMD improves the spectral representation of the 
original time series, enabling a better detection of periodic and overall trends.   
 
It is shown from the case study that the trend of the Chrysene concentration is decreasing.  
The results reproduced in this paper show that it is possible to capture the trend and noise
