Abstract
Using polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR)
measurements together with associated
simulation, magnetic structures of two Ni80Fe20
(111)/Ru (0001) multilayer samples with Ru
thickness of 9 and 21 Å were investigated under
various external magnetic fields at room
temperature. The results reveal the existence of
layer thickness, interface roughness, magnetic
moment, interlayer coupling angle, and
non-collinear coupling. The former three are
independent of Ru thickness; while the latter
two are strongly dependent of the Ru thickness.
Keywords: Polarized neutron reflectivity;
Magnetic structures; Interlayer coupling angle
1. Introduction
Recently layered structures consisting of a
synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAF) layer, which
is two ferro-magnetic (FM) layers
antiferromagnetically coupled through a thin
spacer (typically Ru) layer, are of strong interest
for the read heads and magnetic media in very
high-density magnetic recording. In a SyAF, a
large change in magnetoresistance (MR) has
been observed in the transition metal multilayers
[1] and rare-earth multilayers [2]. As a result,
the magnitude of the MR is attributed to
spin-dependent scattering of the conduction
electrons and is correlated with the interlayer
coupling between adjacent FM layers. In
addition, a biquadratic coupling, which favors
90° spin alignment of the magnetization in
adjacent magnetic layers, was detected in some
systems for certain ranges of interlayer
thickness [3-6]. Since polarized neutron
reflectometry (PNR) is sensitive to the interlayer
and orientation of the internal magnetic axes
with respect to the external applied magnetic
field [7], PNR is thus employed in this study in
order to understand the magnetic structures of
the Ni80Fe20/Ru multilayers. The characteristics
under investigation include layer thickness,
interface roughness, magnetic moment,
interlayer coupling angle, and non-collinear
coupling.
2. Experimental
In this study, two 40 mm2 multilayer samples
with different Ru thicknesses (t) were prepared
by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) under an
ultra-high vacuum condition (< 5x10-6 Pa). A 40
Å thick NiFe seed layer was first deposited on a
sapphire Al2O3 (11-20)/Pt (111) substrate-buffer
system. Furthermore NiFe (40 Å)/Ru (t) (t = 9
and 21 Å) superlattices with five repeats were
consecutively grown. Notably, the orientations
of epitaxial NiFe and Ru are given by (111) and
(0001), respectively. The additional 15 Å Pt
layer was capped on the top of the samples on
purpose in order to prevent from oxidization.
The surface structure and epitaxial orientations
of the samples were monitored by in-situ
reflection high energy electron diffraction
(RHEED). The PNR measurements were
performed at the C5 beamline of National
Research Universal (NRU) research reactor at
