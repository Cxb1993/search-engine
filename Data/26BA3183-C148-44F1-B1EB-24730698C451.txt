Abstract
Wireless mesh networks are specific
ad hoc networks that are formed to provide
reliable networks with the support for low
cost of deployment, high scalability, and
high availability. This work designs,
develops, and implements load balance
routing and recovery point-based anycast
and multicast schemes in wireless mesh
networks. We first use gateway-based
metrics to develop network partition
scheme. Based on the scheme, we develop
dynamic load balance routing protocols.
Then, we develop reliable and efficient
anycast-K and multicast protocols based
on the recovery-point schemes. We also use
the virtual backbone techniques to enhance
the scalability of proposed schemes.
Finally, we design and develop reliable
multicast protocols based on recovery point
and forward error correction techniques.

二、計畫緣起與目的
無 線 網 狀 網 路 (Wireless Mesh
Network)是屬於隨意行動網路(Mobile Ad
Hoc Network, MANETs)中的一種特殊架
構，現在漸漸的被使用在一些實際的應用
4初步分群的目的。
為了可以運用特定的節點，適時地將
網路上的流量進行分流的動作，在分群完
成之後，閘道器會再傳送出 RST (Rooted
Spanning Tree)訊息， 用Breath First Search
的方式將歸屬於自己的節點連結為樹狀結
構，當隸屬於某個閘道器的節點收到來自
於鄰近閘道器的 RST 訊息時，表示自己應
臨界於兩閘道器之間，此時則將自己設定
為邊際點，而且不會再將來 RST 訊息廣
播下去，藉以挑選出適合的邊際點。完成
以上的步驟之後，每個閘道器會制定一個
門閥值，當流量超過這個值時則準備開始
執行調整流量，將多餘的流量導向其他閘
道器以增加資料傳送時的效率。在閘道器
上門閥值的設定我們採取能力大者分配較
多流量的原則，首先由於我們考量累進稅
率的概念定義出一個關於門閥值累進表，
如表 1 所示。在此表中將頻寬分為 n 個區
間，閘道器依照自己的頻寬落在那一個區
間之後，再利用公式(3)算出自己的門閥
值。

四、任播-K 協定
在我們過去所開發出來任播-K 機制
中，我們在任播樹上的一些特定節點上儲
存了群播樹中服務主機的數量與距離，這
些點再利用這些資訊來負責分配各個下游
分支要找尋的資源數量，這樣的方式雖然
可以很快的找到服務資源而且所造成網路
的負擔不會太大，但是當服務要求者變多
或是所要求的服務資源數量(K 值)變多
時，很容易造成服務找尋的成功率下降。
主要的原因是儲存資訊的不正確與資源尋
找過程的不完整。
因此我們發展出一個利用重找的機制
來增加服務尋找時的成功率。一般來說重
找機制都是由服務要求者所發動的，但是
如果每次重找都要由服務要求者重新尋找
的話，那將會造成很大的負擔與服務的延
遲。因此我們在服務要求者與提供者之間
設定一些恢復點，讓這些點來負責重找的
程序以增加尋找服務時的成功率，在這樣
的設計概念中我們考慮了以下幾點。第一
個部分是 恢復點的選擇，在我們過去所開
發出來任播-K 機制中，我們利用了在任播
樹上的一些特定節點來儲存服務主機的資
訊與利用這些資訊來分配各個下游分支要
找尋的資源數量。因為在服務資源尋找過
程中尋找的封包與回應的封包都會通過這
些特定的節點，所以我們將會選擇這些節
點來當做我們在發動重找機制時預設的恢
復點。此外在我們的機制中，原本的服務
資訊要求者也是預設的恢復點。以圖 1 為
例，節點 5、8、23 與 29 將是我們所設定
的恢復點。

圖 2 向前錯誤更正碼技術
基於以上的原因，我們利用向前錯誤
更正碼(Forward Error Correction，FEC)的
技術來結合我們原本的恢復點技術，在不
增加太多網路負擔的前提下增進群播協定
的可靠度。如圖 2 所示，向前錯誤更正碼
技術主要是利用編碼技術將原本所要傳送
的封包編碼(假設編碼前有 k 個封包，編碼
後有 n 個封包，且 n > k)，然後傳送者將
這 n 個封包傳送出去，接收者只要收到其
中任意 k 個封包就可以將原本 k 個封包解
碼。
我們利用向前錯誤更正碼技術讓群播
傳送者在傳送資料前編碼，然後將資料傳
送出去，群播樹上的恢復點在接收資料時
即使發現有封包遺失，只要有接收到足夠
的封包就不需要啟動封包恢復機制。但是
在這樣的設計概念下要考慮如何避免向前
錯誤更正碼技術對網路所造成的負擔，從
圖 2 我們可以知道編碼後的封包數量(n)
如果比原本的封包數量(k)多越多可以使
整體的資料傳送可靠度越高，但是如果多
太多將會使得網路上有許多重覆的封包在
傳送造成網路很大的負擔。

圖 3 以恢復點與向前錯誤更正碼技術為
基礎的群播協定
因此，在我們設計的概念中因為我們
有封包恢復點的角色，所以當恢復點接收
到足夠多的封包數量後，可以通知上游的
恢復點或是傳送者停止傳送封包，這樣既
可以增加傳送資料的可靠度也不會造成網
路太多額外的負擔。以圖 3 為例，傳送者
會先將要傳的資料切成一個一個傳輸群組
(TGi)，每個傳輸群組有 k 個封包，然後將
每 個 傳 輸 群 組 利 用 里 德 所 羅 門 碼
(Reed-Solomon code, RS code)去做編碼，
編碼後會產生 n 個封包，然後傳送者在傳
送每個群組的資料時不會將全部 n 個封包
都傳送到群播樹上，而是只先傳送一定比
例的封包出去，這樣可以減輕對網路所造
成的負擔。當我們群播樹上的恢復點或接
收者收到封包時，會去記錄每個傳輸群組
收到的封包個數，只要收到超過 k 個封包
就可以解碼得到原本 k 個封包的資料。在
群播樹上的恢復點則是會定期的與上游的
恢復點做封包比對與重傳的動作，在這個
動作中恢復點也會知道那些傳輸群組已經
接受超過 k 個封包，這樣上游的恢復點就
可以停止傳送與重送這些群組的資料以減
少不必要的封包在網路中傳送，這樣既可
以增加傳送資料的可靠度也可以減輕傳統
向前錯誤更正碼技術對網路所造成的負
擔。

Abstract
With the rapid development of agent technologies, it
has been an important application on education. There are
many researches on virtual teaching assistant (TA).
However, existing virtual TA systems are either for chatting
or general course uses, but lack assisting functionalities for
lab-based classes. Demonstration and guiding are accounted
very important activities in traditional laboratories.
However, it is difficult for TAs to do the same
demonstration many times, or to give more assistance at the
same time. For the reasons above, this work designs and
implements a lab-based virtual TA that provides more
teaching assistance, increase the interest of learning, and
also reduce both teacher and TAs’workload. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed system is efficient to
guide and assist students in solving their experimental
problems.
Keywords: distance learning, virtual TA, knowledge
retrieval, guiding.
1 Introduction
Nowadays, distance learning develops very quickly,
and the amount of learners also grows up fast. Consequently,
a teacher must cope with a large number of students. Thus,
virtual TAs [1] have been proposed on the educational
application to alleviate the teacher and TA’s loads. Virtual
TAs have been used to help teachers give students
assistance in classes. However, most existing virtual TA
systems provide assistance for general courses, but not for
laboratory courses. The experiment procedure of laboratory
courses need be efficiently demonstrated and guided with
detailed explanation to make students understand the
experiment detail. It needs more dynamic activities, such as
teaching the fundamental of courses, answering students’
questions, guiding students to solve their problems, and
demonstrating the experiment procedure for students. Thus,
TAs are too busy to give more assistance and interaction
with students well.
According to the lab-based course’s need, a virtual
TA should help students find their problems, especially step
by step, and these problems are according to the virtual TA’s
classification which is used to give students hint and guide
them solve their problems. Generally speaking,
demonstration is really important for lab-based course, thus
the virtual TA must conquer the limit of time and place to
present the experiment procedure anytime and anywhere.
Even the virtual TA can demonstrate the experiment
according to the procedure of different topic that is like a
real TA who is requested to demonstrate in class. Besides,
the virtual TA is better to have richer contents in knowledge
retrieval for lab-based course, such as multimedia
explanation content, when students do not understand the
hints of guiding. Moreover, according to everyone’s habits,
someone likes web presentation form, and someone likes
dialogue presentation form, thus the virtual TA should
provide different presentation forms for students to choose
what they want the virtual TA to explain the detailed
answers to them. For these reasons, the task of lab-based TA
agent is to integrate the three activities, guiding,
demonstrating, and explaining, into the general virtual TA.
The objective of this work is to develop and implement
a practical lab-based virtual TA that can be applied to
various laboratory courses, actively guiding students to
solve their problems step by step, making demonstration
many times as students want, and providing assistance at
anytime. Thus, the proposed agent not only can serve more
students in a timely manner but also can be used to reduce
the TA’s workload by answering repeated questions and
saving the valuable time of the TA. The remainder of the
paper is organized as follows. The related work is described
briefly in Section 2. The system architecture is presented in
Section 3. The system implementation is presented in
Section 4. The experimental results are shown in Section 5,
and the conclusions are finally made in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Over the past years, the traditional way of a lab-based
class is that a TA assists students in performing experiments
in a laboratory. Regarding TA’s work in traditional teaching
[15], no matter what kinds of courses, all TAs have their
assignments but it may have difference among different
teaching areas. Thus, there are various handbooks for TAs
[16] with the goal for new TAs, and for lab-based courses.
There are several general teaching tips for lab sections [19]
which can provide lab-based TAs suggestions for problem
solving and knowledge response.
invoke the learning module to get appropriate knowledge
from outside resources, such as other agents, related
materials even from the instructor, and then they can
recommend the probably answers to users. The feedback
mechanism is used to judge if users satisfy with the
retrieval results from our system, the answers and responses
can be effectively updated.
4 System Implementation
The implementation of four major modules,
knowledge retrieval, demonstration, and learning modules
are described in this section.
4.1 Guiding Module
The guiding module leads users by a script-oriented
manner. In the beginning, the virtual TA will lead users to
understand how to operate the system actively. When the
users ask the virtual TA questions, according to the
suggestions, the virtual TA would remind users to make
them take notice of the step that they may be wrong during
the experiment. If users can not solve the problems in a
short time, the virtual TA will help them follow its
instruction step by step to solve the problems.

Figure 2 Operation flow of the guiding module
Figure 2 shows the operation flow of the guiding
module. The guiding module has many interactions with
users, such as guiding users to gain cognition easily,
demonstrating the experiment procedure for users to be able
to accomplish this task and explaining users’questions to
solve their problems. Guiding module can also identify
users’learning situation through all activities of the virtual
TA and students.
4.2 Knowledge Retrieval Module
The knowledge retrieval module is used to provide the
users about the experiment knowledge, including
recommending the appropriate suggestions to solve users’
problems, explanation for suggestions, and the examples
through the Web interface. Our system supports basic
Boolean operations including brackets, AND, OR, and NOT
operators. Therefore, students can enter a set of keywords
which contain Boolean operators to query or sentences to
chat with the virtual TA via a user interface. First, our
system must translate a set of keywords or sentences
inputted from the user into queries expressed in a structured
language. Then, our system seeks the appropriate answers
which verify the meaning of keywords or sentences from
the knowledge base. Finally, our system replies the
appropriate answers to students immediately. We have
different approaches to handle a set of keywords which
contain Boolean operators and sentences. For sentences,
they will be removed the redundant words first, such as
“is,”“the,”and“of”words…etc,by the knowledge retrieval
module. After removing, sentences will be segmented to
words. For a set of keywords including Boolean operators,
they will be translated into queries expressed in a structured
language. In the final stage, the knowledge retrieval module
verifies those words by matching the knowledge in the
knowledge base. And then it will generate possible answers
with the corresponding question. If the virtual TA can not
answer the user’s query and the virtual TA will invoke the
learning module to find the answers.
4.3 Demonstration Module
After asking the virtual TA or practicing the
experimental examples, if users do not understand the
experiment steps, they can request the virtual TA to
demonstrate it for them. The complete experiment
procedure is segmented into several parts, and each part has
a main topic about its guiding content. Thus, there is a key
point in every topic to make students realize the goals of
this experiment. Users can choose the part that they want to
see, and they can also choose the step to see the detailed
explanation, or choose the demonstration again. Figure 3
shows the operation flow of demonstration module.

4.4 Learning Module
When the virtual TA receives unanswered questions, it
will invoke the learning module which has several learning
approaches to find the answers from outside resources. In
addition, in order to increase the usability of the answers
provided by the virtual TA, the feedback mechanism is used.
values of explaining in “importance”and “satisfaction”are
4.72 and 4.24. As the same as demonstrating, the TA’s work
on explaining is indeed heavier but is still insufficient to
compare with the ideal condition. Next, the user satisfaction
with the proposed virtual TA will be presented. One to five
points denote “totally disagree”to “totally agree”and are
adopted to calculate the total score and then computing the
average value for each item.

Figure 6 Average value of user feedback
The average value of user feedback with the proposed
virtual TA system is shown in Figure 6. It denotes that it
receives the higher satisfaction ratings in the
“demonstrating for many times”and“guiding users to solve
problems”. It is also conformed to the investigation of
activity beforehand, and it should denote that students
consider that the virtual TA can give assistance on guiding
and demonstrating. The average values of “guiding users to
solve problems,” “demonstrating for many times,”and
“helpful to assist on learning network lab”are higher. It
shows that the proposed virtual TA really can reach what
kind of assistance students want in lab-based courses. In
additional, “heighten interesting with communication” has 
the smaller average value. Because there are many kinds of
messengers which have strong functions at present that user
can have many choices, they may think that proposed
virtual TA with conversation is not such important for them.

Figure 7 Average value of activities between general and
lab-based course TA
The proposed virtual TA is applied in education to
assist students in learning and help them resolve their
experimental problems. We introduce the comparison
between the proposed virtual TA and the TA. First, we make
a statistic for 10 TAs in general course and 10 TAs in
lab-based courses. Figure 7 shows the average value of ten
activities between general course TAs and lab course TAs.
From the data, we can see that the TAs consider telling,
assessing, and explaining are more important in general
courses and the TAs consider demonstrating, practicing, and
explaining are more important in lab courses. There is more
difference between demonstrating, assessing, and practicing
in general and lab courses. According to this statistics, we
can be more determined that the requirements in different
quality courses are not the same. Next, we analyze and
compare the ten activities between lab TA and students.
Figure 8 shows the importance and satisfaction for lab
TA. Comparing importance with satisfaction, we can see lab
TAs consider demonstrating, practicing, and explaining are
very important, but their workloads on these are not equal
to or higher than their anticipation. It shows that their work
is very heavy to handle a lot of assistance for each student.
As a whole, the satisfaction values are almost lower than
the importance values, and this phenomenon interprets the
virtual TA’s importance to make up for traditional TAs that
they can not give assistance for students one by one very
well.
From the point of view of the TA, the TA’s tasks in
explaining and demonstrating have the higher average
values. After using the proposed virtual TA, it can not only
reduce the TA’s loads but also can give more assistance for
students to make up the shortcoming in class. The TA can
also realize the students’learning situation and the
frequently problems are recorded by the virtual TA system’s,
thus it can save much time on explaining the same question
again and again. Besides, the proposed virtual TA can
demonstrate the experiment for students and be requested
for many times to make students can understand the
experiment deeply.

6 Conclusions
In this work, we proposed a lab-based virtual TA,
various requirements for lab-based courses than the general
courses. According to our analysis results, the main
activities between TAs and students in laboratory courses
are guiding, demonstrating, and explaining to lead users to
solve their problems step by step and give the detailed
