In this investigation, the hand-transmitted vibration of the push-type compactor is measured and 
evaluated by using the method of spectrum analysis. It is in accordance with the international standards ISO 
5349Mechanical VibrationMeasurement and evaluation of human exposure to hand-transmitted vibration. 
Measure directions of the handgrip position of the operator are defined and frequency responses and 1/3 
octave are measured in the defined directions to evaluate the transmitted vibration from the compactor. Soil 
properties included the density of soil, dry density, and water content of soil are defined and examined on the 
effect of the hand-transmitted vibration. Effects of the velocity of compactor, operators with or without gloves, 
and users with or without shoes on the hand-transmitted vibration are also studied in this investigation. Effects 
of the hand-transmitted vibration on the vibration-induced white finger (VWF) are discussed. The value of 
daily vibration exposure can be expressed in terms of the 8-h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted vibration 
total value. Values of the daily vibration exposure in the operation of the compactor in the cases of different 
properties of soil and different velocities of compactor are obtained. Vibration exposure for predicted 10 % 
prevalence of vibration-induced white finger for a given number of years is discussed.

ABSTRACT 
A procedure is developed in this investigation to study the propagation of impact-induced axial waves in 
the constrained beams that undergo large rigid body displacements. The solution of the wave equations is 
obtained using the Fourier method. Kinematic conditions which describe mechanical joints in the system are 
formulated using a set of nonlinear algebraic constraint equations that are introduced to the dynamic 
formulation using the vector of Lagrange multipliers. The initial conditions which represent the jump 
discontinuity in the elastic coordinates as the result of impact are predicted using the generalized impulse 
momentum equations that involve the coefficient of restitution as well as the Jacobian matrix of the kinematic 
constraints. The convergence of the series solutions presented in this paper is examined and the analytical and 
numerical results are found to be consistent with the solutions obtained by the use of the classical theory of 
elasticity in the case of plastic impact. The cases in which without and with the gravity are also examined and 
it is shown that the generalized impulse momentum equations can be used with confidence to study the 
propagation of elastic waves in applications related to multibody dynamic systems.

section, matrix partitioning method is used to obtain a closed form solution for the algebraic generalized impulse 
momentum equations. The solution of these equations defines the jump discontinuity in the system variables as the result 
of impact.

By substituting Eq. (29) into Eq. (24), the inverse of the matrix Mλ given by Eq. (23) can be evaluated symbolically. 
This inverse can then be substituted into Eq. (21) in order to determine, in a closed form, the solution of the generalized 
impulse momentum equations given by Eq. (13). 
 
5. IMPACT INDUCED WAVES 
In this section the propagation of the impact-induced waves is analyzed using Fourier method, wherein the wave 
motion is represented by using the mode superposition technique. The longitudinal displacement of an arbitrary 
point on the beam after impact can be obtained by using the modal superposition as

By using Eq. 20, the longitudinal displacement of Eq. (31) can be expressed as the sum of two functions as follows

point in the beam is practically impossible. Furthermore, the excitation of the infinite number of modes cannot be 
achieved since the frequency content and the magnitude of any impulsive forcing function have an upper and lower 
limits. Observe also that in the analysis presented in this paper, the short-lived time interval of the collision is assumed to 
be equal to zero. In practical situations no event occurs in zero time and consequently the inertia of the mass and the 
contact forces in the impact zone during the period of collision may lead to deviations from the theoretical treatment 
presented in this paper. Since infinite number of modes cannot be practically excited, the momentum balance approach 
and the concept of the coefficient of restitution that allows for the possibility of the mass to be separated from the beam 
immediately after impact remain applicable to the impact problems in flexible body dynamics in general and in the 
analysis of wave propagation in particular.
