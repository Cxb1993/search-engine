ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this project is to provide the methodology to analyze the transient response 
problems of a laminated composite tube subject to time dependent mechanical loads, which 
include applied time dependent bending, torsion, extension and non-uniform surface tractions. 
The laminated composite tubes of this study are formed by perfectly bonding certain number of 
cylindrically anisotropic layers whose material constants are different. The main frame of this 
analysis is based on the state-space approach. The derivations are accomplished through using the 
theories of matrix algebra and the methods of complex Fourier series expansion. The transient 
solutions are considered to be the superposition of the quasi-static solutions and dynamic 
solutions. The quasi-static solutions have to be determined in advance such that the dynamic 
solutions can be derived based on them. Comparing to the solutions found in literature about 
transient or dynamic problems associated with similiar composite tubes, there are three features 
concluded for our results: (1), the solutions which are shown in matrix forms are more compact 
and applicable. (2), the transient solutions can be applied to an asymmetry problem while the 
other solutions, as the author’s understanding, are only for axisymmetric dynamic or transient 
problems. (3), the material properties of each layer cover wide span of material elastic constants, 
from isotropic to generally cylindrically anisotropy. 
 
摘要 
本研究計畫之主要目的在於針對複合疊層圓管受到時變機械負載作用下之暫態反應
階段彈性問題進行解析。該時變機械負載包含了考慮彎矩、拉伸、扭轉以及非軸對稱表面
牽應力之動態作用。本研究對象為複合疊層圓管，該圓管係由數個具有不同材料性質之柱
型異向性(cylindrically anisotropic)圓形管層所完全黏合而成。本項研究之解析過程以狀態
空間法 (state-space approach) 為基礎，運用矩陣代數理論以及複數富立葉級數展開等數學
方法或技巧進行推導。在求解過程中先行整理出準靜態解，而後再藉以該準靜態解導出動
態解。本計畫成果相較於文獻上之將關研究具有以下三項特點：（1）、相對於其他先前之
研究大多以 Bessel 函數展開動態解，本計畫則嘗試利用特徵向量展開之技巧，因此所呈
現之矩陣形式顯示式解具有相對簡潔及易於應用的特性。（2）、相對於先前其他文獻皆針
對於軸對稱位移問題，本計畫成果則能應用於非軸對稱問題，當然也就包含了軸對稱位移
問題。（3）、相對於先前其他文獻只能分析等向性或軸正交性材質之複合管，本計畫成果
能應用於從等向性到一般柱型異向性複合圓管問題。 
     
 
前言 
   The circular cylindrical tube is a widely used kind of structural members in the fields of 
industrial applications. Furthermore, the tubular composites are especially proper and useful in 
orbiting space structures. To analysis the strength and stress distribution in designing laminated 
composite tubes, the dynamic or transient response solutions are important and typical for 
engineers and scientists. As to the material properties of a cylindrical tube, cylindrically 
anisotropy is not uncommon to happen. For instances, some raw materials, such as bamboo, tree 
trunk and carbon fiber posses cylindrically anisotrpic behaviors (Christensen, 1994) and certain 
metallic forming process, such as extrusion, drawing, may result cylindrically anisotropic 
 3
dependent surface pressure. Ding et. al. (2003a, 2003b) and Wang et. al. (2005) extended the 
methodology of Yin and Yue (2002) to derive the dynamic solutions of a multilayered 
orthotropic piezoelectric hollow cylinder. Since the problems are also axisymetry ones, the 
method developed by Yin and Yue (2002) is successfully applied.

   Consider a laminated composite tube whose geometric configuration is shown as Fig. 1. The 
number of layers is N for this analysis. For the layer i, the inner radius and outer radius are 
denoted as ai and bi, respectively. Therefore, it is obvious that 21 ab = , 32 ab = , …, NN ab =−1  
and a1 and bN are respectively the inner radius and outer radius for the whole laminated 
composite structure. The results of this study are presented for the quasi-static part and dynamic 
part in sequence. In the following results, the quantities associated with layer i are denoted with 
the subscript (i).

ABSTRACT 
An analytical solution of the problem of a cylindrically 
anisotropic tube which contains a line dislocation is presented 
in this study. The state space formulation in conjunction with 
the eigenstrain theory is proved to be a feasible and systematic 
methodology to analyze a tube with the existence of 
dislocations. The state space formulation which expediently 
groups the displacements and the cylindrical surface traction 
can construct a governing differential matrix equation. By 
using Fourier series expansion and the well developed theory 
of matrix algebra, the asymmetrical solutions are not only 
explicit but also compact in form. The dislocation considered in 
this study is a kind of mixed dislocation which is the 
combination of edge dislocations and a screw dislocation and 
the dislocation line is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
tube. The degeneracy of the eigen relation and the technique to 
determine the inverse of a singular matrix are thoroughly 
discussed, so that the general solutions can be applied to the 
case of isotropic tubes, which is one of the novel features of 
this research. The results of isotropic problems, which are 
belong to the general solutions, are compared with the well-
established expressions in the literature. The satisfied 
correspondences of these comparisons indicate the validness of 
this study. A cylindrically orthotropic tube is also investigated 
as an example and the numerical results for the displacements 
and tangential stress on the outer surface are displayed. The 
effects on surface stresses due to the existence of a dislocation 
appear to have a characteristic of localized phenomenon. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The characters of cylindrical anisotropy not only exist in 
the natural raw materials, such as bamboo, tree truck, and so 
on, but also the metallic cylindrical body manufactured by 
metallic forming process, extrusion, and drawing [1]. 
Furthermore, some sorts of composite structures widely used in 
the industries, for example the filamentary wound composite 
tubes, also can be considered as a cylindrically anisotropic 
materials in a macroscopic point of view. 
 For many decades, scientists and engineers keep devoting 
to analyzing bodies made of cylindrically anisotropic materials. 
Among the formalisms used in the literature, the well-
established stress function method proposed by Lekhnitskii [1] 
is well known as an effective approach. However, it commonly 
happens to the analysis that the formulations and equations 
could lead to complicated and even formidable forms. 
Therefore, most of the researches focused on axisymmetric 
problems [2-4], or otherwise some restrictions on materials 
properties have to be made [5-7] to shape to a solvable 
situation. Similar to Stroh formalism, Ting [2,3] successfully 
established Stroh-like formalism for solving the problems 
associated with anisotropic materials in cylindrical coordinates. 
Nevertheless, if one wants to solve an axially asymmetrical 
problem by using this formalism, some breakthrough of the 
mathematical formulations should be further established. Tarn 
[8] constructed a state space formalism which is proved to be 
an efficient way in solving the problems of cylindrically 
anisotropic tubes. The state space formalism effectively groups 
the displacements and the cylindrical surface traction to a 
variable which is referred to as the state vector. By substituting 
the strain-displacement and stress-strain relations into the 
equilibrium equations, a first order differential matrix equation, 
the state equation, can be formed. By using the theories of 
matrix algebra, the variable can be explicitly determined such 
that the displacements and stresses are almost simultaneously 
solved. In addition, the state space formalism also has been 
proved applicable in solving the problems of laminated 
composite tubes [9]. 
Dislocations are one kind of defects exist in the structure 
elements. As a metallic component is manufactured by some 
particular machining process, such as metal forming, extrusion 
and so on, the dislocations do easily come to existence. The 
existence of dislocations admits metals and even nonmetallic 
crystalline materials being plastically deformed with ease. 
Taylor [10] is well known as the first one who proposed the 
concept of dislocation. Since then, there are numerous studies 
focused on the investigations of the damage effects due to the

It is emphasized that τr is the traction vector on a cylindrical 
surface of constant coordinate r. Furthermore, by substituting

The previous expressions are derived based on state space 
method [8] with taking account of the existence of eigenstrains. 
Equations (13) and (10) are respectively referred to as state 
equation and output equation and the variable [u rτr]T is the 
state vector by name. Once the state equation is solved, τs can 
be readily determined by using τr and u. However, although the 
appearance of Eq. (13) is a concise first order differential 
equation, the operators L1 and L2 involved in it actually make 
this equation a three-dimensional partial differential equation 
for a general cylindrically anisotropic elastic problem in 
general. To determine this most general problem would be a 
very cumbersome task, yet it will become feasible if one apply 
this formulation to a simplified case, such as the plane or 
axisymmetric problems. 
 
PLANE EIGENSTRAIN 
If a body is in a situation that the generalized plane strain 
can be maintained, the cylindrical coordinate system can be 
adjusted without losing generality such that the displacement 
and stress field are invariant along the coordinate z. The state 
vector and eigenstrain for the plane strain problem are 
accordingly functions of r and θ. Therefore, the general 
expression (13) can be reduced to a compact form

In view of the simple structures as shown in the above, we can 
anticipate that an axisymmetric problem is comparatively easier 
to be solved on condition that the eigenstrain can be properly 
formulated. 
 
LINE DISLOCATION PROBLEMS 
In this section, we try to analyze a tube which is infused 
with a line dislocation (see Fig.1). Consider a cylindrically 
anisotropic tube whose inner and outer diameters are 
respectively a and b and the dislocation line being parallel with 
the generator. The dislocation line passes through the point 
),( 0θρ  on the cross section as shown in Fig. 2. The dislocation 
considered here is a mixed dislocation whose Burgers vector is 
represented by b = [br bθ bz]T. The three components of b 
actually comprise two kinds of slips on the slip plane. The 
screw component bz is the slip magnitude along with the 
direction of dislocation line whereas the slip magnitudes br and 
bθ, perpendicular to bz, represents the edge components in the 
directions of r and θ, respectively. The dislocation discussed 
here acts as both characters of screw dislocation and edge 
dislocation.

concentrated line force applied at along the same line of 
application crossing the generator: 
The concentrated line force applied on the outer surface is 
F=[Fr Fθ 0]T and, at the same time, the inner surface is exerted 
by −F. This pair of concentrated line forces must satisfy the 
requirement of static equilibrium, which requires that they are 
along the same line of application θ=θ0. The surface loads 
demand the surface tractions in forms of aτr(a,θ)=aFδ(θ−θ0) 
and bτr(a,θ)=bFδ(θ−θ0), and hence

EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSIONS 
(a) Isotropic Tubes 
Although the methodology introduced in this paper 
assumes that the tube materials are generally cylindrical 
anisotropic, the general solutions still can be applied to 
degenerated materials. An isotropic material is a typical kind of 
degenerated materials [17]. The moduli of an isotropic material 
are

Equation (97) describes the variation of σrθ of an infinite elastic 
medium containing both a circular hole of radius a and a line 
edge dislocation with Burgers vector br. However, the rather 
deviation in the interval ρ/a ≤ r/a ≤5 is perceivable due to 
boundary effects of the traction-free outer surface. 
(b) Cylindrically Orthotropic Tubes 
In order to examine the effects of a line dislocation on a 
tube, we demonstrate the stress analysis of a cylindrically 
orthotropic tube. The material constants of the tube are 
presumed to be:

FIGURE 3 THE STRESS DISTRIBUTION FOR 
SCREW DISLOCATION 
Figures 5 and 6 are the numerical results of the edge line 
dislocation problem with b=[0 bθ 0]T. It can be visualized that 
by inserting or removing some half planes of atoms into the 
lattice plane (r≥ρ, θ=θ0) makes the tube infused with an edge 
dislocation whose Burgers vector exhibits in the θ direction. As 
Fig. 5 indicates, uθ undergoes a jump in the amount of bz at θ = 
π and, in addition, the curve of ur shoots up at the same place. 
One may notice that the peak value of ur is much higher than 
that of uθ. Figure 6 reveals the localized effect on the tangential 
stress. It is worth noting that, although one may perceive the 
insertion of addition atom half plane should cause compression 
in the nearby lattice, the region very close to inserting plane is 
subjected to tension stress on the contrary.
