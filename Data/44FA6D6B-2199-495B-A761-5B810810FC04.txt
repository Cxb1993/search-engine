compensating for the effects of the analog parts.
II. MODEL OF THE JITTER-INDUCED INTERFERENCE
Assume that the channel in Fig. 2 is a wide-band linear-phase
channel such that the channel model shown in Fig. 3 can be applied.
Let aˆ[m] denote the m-th transmitted data sample. The digital-to-
analog converter (DAC) is modeled as a zero-order-hold block where
T0 represents the sampling period. The ADC is modeled as a sampler
that takes samples at multiple time-instants nT0 +ε+τn where ε (0≤
ε < T0) denotes the deterministic timing offset between the transmitter
and the receiver, and τn represents the random timing jitter of the
ADC. Let hsm(t) and han(t) be the impulse responses of Sm(s) and
An(s), respectively, and let hana(t) = hsm(t)∗han(t).
If we denote r[n] = r(nT0 + ε+ τn), we can obtain
r[n] = ∑
m
aˆ[m]
∫ (n−m)T0+ε+τn
[n−(m+1)]T0+ε+τn
hana(τ)dτ
= ∑
m
aˆ[m]
{∫ (n−m)T0+ε
[n−(m+1)]T0+ε

−
∫ [n−(m+1)]T0+ε+τn
[n−(m+1)]T0+ε
hana(τ)dτ
}
. (1)
Next, denote
hεΠ[n] =
∫ nT0+ε
(n−1)T0+ε
hana(τ)dτ, n = 0,1,2, . . . . (2)
Thus, (1) can be written as
r[n] = aˆ[n]∗hεΠ[n]+
∑
m
aˆ[m]
{∫ (n−m)T0+ε+τn

∫ [n−(m+1)]T0+ε+τn
[n−(m+1)]T0+ε
hana(τ)dτ
}
. (3)
The first term of (3) is the jitter-free term. The second term of (3)
corresponds to the additive, data-dependent, jitter-induced interfer-
ence.
In practice, the jitter is sufficiently small. Therefore,
r[n] ≈ aˆ[n]∗hεΠ[n]+ τn ∑
m
aˆ[m]{hana((n−m)T0 + ε)
−hana((n−m−1)T0 + ε)}
= aˆ[n]∗hεΠ[n]+ τnaˆ[n]∗{h

δ[n−1]} (4)
where hεδ[n] = hana(nT0 +ε). Notably, since hana(t) is essentially time
limited in practice [14], so are hεΠ[n] and hεδ[n]. Therefore, the channel
can be modeled as an FIR channel in practice. Now, we put the jitter-
induced interference aside for a while. We will discuss it later in
Section IV.
It is noted that the values of hεΠ[n] depend on ε. Therefore, a
different timing offset ε leads to different hεΠ[n]. In order to obtain
an optimum sample timing, a clock recovery subsystem is required,
which is beyond the scope of this paper. When the clock recovery
subsystem works fine, we will have ε = 0. Because h0Π[0] = 0, we
use hT0Π [n] instead of h
0
Π[n] later. It is noted that h
T0
Π [n] = h
0
Π[n+1].
In general, since the sampling rate 1/T0 and the analog filters Sm(s)
and An(s) are known a priori, we can use them to construct an M-tap
FIR channel equivalence ˜hT0Π [n], n = 0,1, . . . ,M−1, by truncating the
first M samples of hT0Π [n]. Next, let
hins[n] = ˜hT0Π [M−1−n]. (5)
Thus, ˜hT0Π [n]∗hins[n] will possess a linear phase response. This implies
that the nonlinear phase distortion introduced by Sm(s) and An(s)
can be approximately compensated for by inserting hins[n] in the
transmitter or receiver.
III. THE FORMULATIONS OF TIME-DOMAIN AND
FREQUENCY-DOMAIN RESPONSES
Assuming a clock recovery subsystem works fine, we denote
hD[n] = ˜hT0Π [n]∗hins[n].
The length of hD[n] is 2M−1. From (5), hD(n) is symmetric.
Recall that N denotes the length of the SR filter. Since we
employ the matched SR filter pair, we have hr[n] = ht [N − 1− n],
n = 0,1, . . . ,N−1, and h[n] = ht [n]∗ht [N−1−n]. The length of h[n]
is 2N−1.
The complete impulse response of the system hc[n] is equal to h[n]∗
hD[n]. Since both h[n] and hD[n] are symmetric, so is hc[n]. The length
of hc[n] equals 2N + 2M − 3. For the sake of convenience, we let
hc[n] = hc[−n], |n| ≤N +M−2. We next express hc[n] in matrix form.
Let h = (h[0] h[1] · · · h[N−1])T , hD = (hD[0] hD[1] · · · hD[2M−2])T ,
and let Sn, |n| ≤ N +M−2, be an (2M−1)× (2N−1) matrix whose
kth-row, lth-column element is
(Sn)k,l =
{
1, k + l = n+N +M
0, otherwise. (6)
Denote as Il , Jl , and 0l the l× l identity matrix, the l× l antidiagonal
matrix, and the l×1 zero vector, respectively. Let
E =
(
IN
JN−1 0N−1
)
(7)
Then hc[n] can be written, for |n| ≤ N +M−2, as
hc[n] = hDT SnEh. (8)
Denote ˆSn = SnE, then
hc[n] = hDT ˆSnh. (9)
V. THE DESIGN PROBLEM FORMULATION
Having expressed hc[0], the frequency responses, ISI, and the
roughness cost function R in terms of h in (10)–(21), we can now
formulate our design problem. Let η denote the maximum stopband
gain of h[n]. The design problem becomes a linear semi-infinite
programming (SIP) problem :

where γISI represents the specification of the tolerable ISI. The
unknowns for the above optimization problem are h and α j, j =
1,2, . . . ,⌊(N +M−2)/T⌋. In (22), since A(ω)h is sufficiently smooth
in practice, we can sample A(ω)h to obtain a finite number of
constraints. Therefore, (22) can be solved by any linear programming
package [18].
The design procedure is as follows: Given the transfer functions
of two analog filters Sm(s), An(s), the estimated initial filter length
N of the SR filter [8], the roll-off factor ρ, the over-sampling ratio
T , the tolerable ISI γISI, and the specification of the stopband gain
constraint η of the Nyquist filter h[n].
1) Find the discrete-time equivalent ˜hT0Π [m] of the analog parts and
find the samples of h0δ[n].
2) Evaluate the M-tap phase-equalizing FIR filter hins[m].
3) Calculate hD[m] = hins[m]∗ ˜hT0Π [m] and h j[n] = hins[n]∗h0δ [n].
4) Use formulation (22) to obtain the solution of h.
5) If no feasible solution is found, then N = N +1. Go to Step 4.
6) Otherwise, perform a spectral factorization [18] of h[n],n =
0,1, . . . ,2N − 2, to obtain the SR filter coefficients ht [n] and
hr [n] = ht [N−1−n].
VI. DESIGN EXAMPLE
In this example, we demonstrate that designing the SR filter
considering the roughness of the waveform before the sampler is
effective in improving the error performance in the presence of
receiver clock jitter. The scenario of this example is listed as follows:
• The smoothing filter at the transmitter and the anti-aliasing filter
at the receiver are 3rd order lowpass Butterworth filters with the
3 dB frequency at 15 MHz. Hence,
Sm(s) = An(s) = 8.3717×1023
s3+1.8550×108s2+1.7765×1016s+8.3717×1023 . (23)
• The baud rate is set to 17.5 MHz and the sampling rate is set
to 70 MHz. Thus, T0 = 1/(70×106) sec. and T = 4.
• ρ = 0.5, η ≥ 41 dB, and γISI ≤−50 dB.
First, we must construct a phase equalizer hins[n] to compensate
for the nonlinear phase response of Sm(s)An(s) using the technique
shown in Section II. The hins[n] we found is shown in Table I, which
is a 17-tap FIR filter.

In this example, we design three FIR SR filters. The first one ht1[n],
with SBATT = 20.520 dB, is designed without considering the effect
of receiver timing jitter. The SR filter ht1[n] is a 11-tap FIR filter
whose coefficients are given in Table II.
The second SR filter is designed by the method of [8] that
employs the conventional eye-opening design methodology. We use
the measurement, EYE, defined in [9] to examine the eye-opening
caused by the hybrid analog/FIR-SR filters. A larger EYE value
corresponds to a wider eye opening. In designing the second SR
filter, we let EYE = 5 dB and obtain a 14-tap ht2[n] that can achieve
20.554-dB SBATT. The coefficients of ht2[n] are shown in Table II
too.
The third SR filter ht3[n] is designed by the proposed method. We
let the filter length be the same as that of ht2[n]. The SBATT of
ht3[n] is 20.525 dB and the roughness R defined in (21) we obtain
is 0.0521. The coefficients of ht3[n] are also given in Table II.
Performance indices (SBATT, ISI, EYE, and R) of the system
employing hti[n] (i = 1,2,3), hins[n], DAC, Sm(s), An(s), sampler,
and hri[n], are summarized in Table III. We can see that all three
systems satisfy the specifications of this example.
Three 256-QAM systems employing hti[n] and hri[n], i = 1,2,3, as
SR filter pairs are simulated. The standard deviation of the receiver
timing jitter is set to 7% of the sampling period in simulations. Their
symbol error rates (SER) are compared. Fig. 5 shows the SER results.
We can see that the system employing ht3[n] and hr3[n] (with its
consideration of the roughness of the waveform) outperforms the

Abstract—This paper presents a method for designing square-root (SR)
FIR filters against receiver timing jitter. The proposed method takes the
filter’s stopband attenuation, the system’s tolerable ISI, and the “roughness”
of the analog/FIR-SR filter’s impulse response into account. Unlike previous
publications, we show that the error-performance of a system employing a
matched SR filter pair, in the presence of receiver timing jitter, is more strongly
related to the roughness of the hybrid analog/FIR-SR filter’s impulse response,
than it is to the eye opening caused by the Nyquist pulse. The design example
validates the proposition that the proposed method can lead to improved error
performance of a QAM communication system in the presence of receiver
clock jitter.
Keywords—jitter-induced interference, pulse-shaping filter, clock jitter.
I. INTRODUCTION
A matched pair of square-root (SR) filters of a Nyquist filter,
used in the transmitter and the receiver of a band-limited digital
communication system, can provide zero inter-symbol interference
(ISI) [1]. In practice, the SR filters are realized in FIR form.
Conventionally, the SR filters are designed by directly designing the
Nyquist filter with a nonnegative frequency response (i.e., ignoring
the linear-phase factor), then getting the matched SR transmitter and
receiver filters by performing a spectral factorization of the Nyquist
filter polynomial [2]–[7].
Although zero ISI is theoretically desired, in practice, it is not
always necessary. In [3]–[7], recognition of the "tolerable ISI" was
proposed. The tolerable ISI should depend on the operating point
(the error rate vs. SNR) of a band-limited digital communication
system. As long as the ISI is smaller than the tolerable ISI, the
error performance of a communication system will not degrade
significantly at the operating point. A small but non-zero ISI provides
an increased degree of freedom in designing the SR filters.
Since there is interference and noise in the channel, the recovered
receiver clock signal must suffer from some timing jitter [8] in
practical implementations of band-limited communication systems.
This receiver timing jitter will deteriorate the error performance.
Consider two cases shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1(a), the designing of
a wide eye-opening Nyquist pulse can alleviate the jitter effect when
the transmitted signal is shaped by the designed wide eye-opening
Nyquist filter h[n]. On the contrary, Figure 1(b) shows the case of
having an SR filter ht [n] at the transmitter and having its matched SR
filter hr[n] at the receiver. Since the samplers are placed at different
locations, the ways how timing jitter affect the received signals in
two cases of Figure 1 should be different even if h[n] = ht [n]∗hr [n].
However, [6], [7], [9], [10] assume that the design of the wide
eye-opening Nyquist pulse is applicable to the Figure 1(b) case.
They assume that there is no jitter in the sampler of the Figure 1(b)
system and the sampled signal is perfectly digitized without any jitter-
induced interference. On the contrary, they assume that the jitter
is introduced in the down sampler such that the design results of
the wide eye-opening Nyquist pulse can be directly applied. The

assumptions of [6], [7], [9], [10] are unrealistic. In the Fig. 1(b)
system, the clock recovery subsystem produces the required clock for
the sampler. No matter how the clock recovery subsystem is realized,
the clock definitely suffers from timing jitter [11]. Thus, the sampler
is the source of the jitter-induced interference. On the other hand, the
down sampler just outputs a digital sample for every T samples it
received. Therefore, no jitter-induced interference will be introduced
in a digital down sampler.
In this paper, we derive the model for the jitter-induced interference
introduced by the sampler. By assuming that the jitter is small (that is
the case in practice), we derive a measurement called the ‘roughness’
that can indicate how bad the jitter-induced interference affect the
error performance of the system. We then propose a design method
for the asymmetrical SR pulse-shaping filters that can minimize the
power of the jitter-induced interference.
On the other hand, the effect of analog front-ends should also be
considered in designing the SR filter pairs [4]–[6], [12], [13]. Figure 2
shows the block diagram of a band-limited digital communication
system. In Figure 2, Sm(s) and An(s) represent the transfer functions
of the analog smoothing filter and the analog anti-aliasing filter,
respectively. Having the analog parts in the system, we are facing a
hybrid FIR-filter/analog-filter pulse-shaping problem. The designing
of ht [n] and hr[n] must consider compensating for the effects of the
analog parts.
II. MODEL OF THE JITTER-INDUCED INTERFERENCE
Assume that the channel in Fig. 2 is a wide-band linear-phase
channel such that the channel model shown in Fig. 3 can be applied.
Let aˆ[m] denote the m-th transmitted data sample. The digital-to-
analog converter (DAC) is modeled as a zero-order-hold block where
T0 represents the sampling period. The ADC is modeled as a sampler
that takes samples at multiple time-instants nT0 +ε+τn where ε (0≤
ε< T0) denotes the deterministic timing offset between the transmitter
and the receiver, and τn represents the random timing jitter of the
World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 78 2011

Fig. 4. A model of interference introduced by the receiver timing jitter.
Next, let us consider designing hybrid analog/FIR-SR filters to
cope with the receiver timing jitter. We assume that the phase
equalizer heq[n] is inserted at the transmitter. Hence, the model for
analyzing the timing jitter is given in Fig. 4 where a[k] is the data
symboland w[n] represents the interference introduced by the receiver
timing jitter. Comparing Fig. 4 with (4), we obtain
aˆ[n] =∑
k
a[k]δ[n−kT ]∗ (ht [n]∗heq[n]).
Let h j[n] = heq[n]∗h0δ[n] and v[n] = ht [n]∗h j[n]. From (4), we obtain
w[n]≈ τn∑
k
a[k](v[n−kT ]−v[n−kT −1]). (14)
Now, since hc[0] = 1/T , at the sampling instants n = k′T , g[n] can
be written as
g[k′T ] = a[k
′]
T
+ ∑
k
k 	=k′
a[k]hc[(k′ −k)T ]+∑
m
w[m]hr[k′T −m]. (15)
The second term of (15) is the conventional ISI term that is coped
with by (13). The third term is the interference caused by the
sampler’s timing jitter.
Next, consider the power of the third term of (15). Assume that
τn is zero-mean, i.i.d., and is uncorrelated with the data symbol. Let
the power spectral density of w[n] be Pww. Then
E
{∣∣∣∑
m
w[m]hr[k′T −m]
∣∣∣2
}

Pww
T
. (16)
To alleviate the interference caused by the receiver timing jitter, we
need to reduce Pww. From (14), we have
Pww = σ2τE
{∣∣∣∣∑
k
a[k](v[n−kT ]−v[n−1−kT ])
∣∣∣∣

where σ2τ represents the variance of τn. Assume that the data symbol
a[n] is i.i.d. with an average power A. Then,
Pww = Aσ2τ
(
T 20 ∑∣∣v[n]−v[n−1]∣∣2)/T 20 . (17)
In (17), we normalize the standard deviation of τn with respect to the
sampling period T0 of the ADC. Therefore, to obtain a small Pww,
we should minimize the roughness cost function
R = T 20 ∑∣∣v[n]−v[n−1]∣∣2. (18)
In order to represent R as a linear function of h, let V (ω),
Ht(ω), and Hj(ω) be the Fourier transforms of v[n], ht [n], and
h j[n], respectively. From Parseval’s theorem, (11), and the fact that
|Ht(ω)|2 = H(ω) (18) is equivalent to

programming package. After h is obtained, we perform a spectral
factorization of h[n] to obtain the SR filter coefficients ht [n] and
hr [n] = ht [N−1−n].
VI. DESIGN EXAMPLE
We compare the filter designed by the proposed method with those
designed by the conventional methods. The scenario is as follows:
• Sm(s) and An(s) are both 3rd order lowpass Butterworth filters
with the 3 dB frequency at 15 MHz. Hence,
Sm(s) = An(s) = 8.3717×1023
s3+1.8550×108s2+1.7765×1016s+8.3717×1023 . (21)
• The baud rate is set to 17.5 MHz and the sampling rate is set
to 70 MHz. Thus, T0 = 1/(70×106) sec. and T = 4.
• ρ= 0.5, 20log(η)≥ 41 dB, and 20log(γISI)≤−50 dB.
First, we construct a phase equalizer heq[n] to compensate for
the nonlinear phase response of Sm(s)An(s). The heq[n] we found
is shown in Table I, which is a 17-tap FIR filter.
We design three SR filters. The first one ht1[n], an 11-tap FIR
filter with SBATT = 20.520 dB, is designed without considering the
receiver timing jitter. The coefficients of ht1[n] are given in Table II.
The second SR filter is designed by the conventional widening eye-
opening method of [6]. We use the metric, EYE, defined in [7] to
examine the eye-opening caused by the hybrid analog/FIR-SR filters.
A larger EYE value corresponds to a wider eye opening. In designing
the second SR filter, we let EYE = 5 dB and obtain a 14-tap ht2[n]
(shown in Table II) that can achieve 20.554 dB SBATT.
The third SR filter ht3[n] is designed by the proposed method. We
let the filter length be the same as that of ht2[n]. The SBATT of
ht3[n] is 20.525 dB and the roughness R is 0.0521. The coefficients
of ht3[n] are also given in Table II.

一、參加會議經過 
 
由  World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology (WASET) 所 舉 辦 的 
International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Electronics and Communication Engineering 
(ICECEC) 是 WASET International University Conference (IUC) 旗下的子會議，每年會在世界各
地舉辦多次，本人參加的是7月13日至7月15日在荷蘭 Amsterdam 近郊 Naarden 所舉行的會
議，與我們熟悉的 IEEE 大型會議相比，WASET 的 IUC 規模相對小很多，以本人參加的這一
次為例，三天的議程有14個 sessions，但同時進行的 parallel sessions 只有兩場，因總共有約250
篇論文發表，平均每個 session 有約17篇論文報告，故每人只有6分鐘，含Q&A，所以 technical 
detail 都要省去，只把重要觀念交待一下，時間就到了。IUC 有一個特色，因 session 不多，但
會議主題包括的範圍卻很廣，跨不同領域的 papers 會出現在同一 session 中，所以報告6分鐘交
待一下重要觀念即可，對聽眾而言，把其他領域的觀念聽一聽，對現今強調跨領域的研究，未嘗
不是一件好事。 
 
Naarden 有Amsterdam 後花園的美稱，是個古
城，舊城的護城河、水道縱橫，防禦工事成星狀，有
犄角之勢，對我們當過預官的人而言，一看就知在火
器不發達、以冷兵器為主的中世紀時代，Naarden 舊
城絕對是個易守難攻之處，即使被包圍，守個一年半
載也不成問題。Naarden 風景優美，極具人文特色，
台灣的地方官員，應都來 Naarden 參觀，看看荷蘭
人如何把古蹟、人文、與現代社會融合得恰到好處。 
 
會議在 NH Naarden Hotel 舉行，旅館不大，對 WASET 的 IUC 而言剛剛好。本人的論文
