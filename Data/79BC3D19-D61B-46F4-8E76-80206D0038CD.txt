Diffusioosmotic Flow of Electrolyte Solutions in Fibrous Porous 
Media at Arbitrary Zeta Potential and Double-Layer Thickness 
 
Abstract   
The diffusioosmosis of an electrolyte solution in the fibrous medium constructed by a 
homogeneous array of parallel, charged, circular cylinders caused by a uniform concentration 
gradient prescribed in the direction along the axes of the cylinders at the steady state is studied 
theoretically.  The cylinders can have either a constant surface potential or a constant surface 
charge density of an arbitrary value.  The electric double layer surrounding each cylinder can 
have an arbitrary thickness relative to the radius of the cylinder.  A unit cell model, which 
allows for the overlap of the double layers of adjacent cylinders, is employed to account for the 
effect of fibers on each other.  The electrostatic potential distribution in the fluid phase of a cell 
is determined by an analytical approximation to the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.  
Solving a modified Navier-Stokes equation with the constraint of no net electric current arising 
from the cocurrent diffusion, electric migration, and diffusioosmotic convection of the 
electrolyte ions, the macroscopic electric field and the fluid velocity along the axial direction 
induced by the imposed electrolyte concentration gradient through the fluid phase in a cell are 
obtained semianalytically as functions of the radial position in a self-consistent manner.  The 
magnitude and direction of the diffusioosmotic flow relative to the concentration gradient are 
determined by the combination of the porosity of the array of cylinders, the zeta potential (or 
surface charge density) of the cylinders, the properties of the electrolyte solution, and other 
relevant factors.  The fluid velocity generally increases with increasing porosity of the array of 
cylinders, but there are exceptions.  The effects of the radial distribution of the induced 
macroscopic electric field and of the ionic convection in the double layers on the 
diffusioosmotic flow are quite significant.

When one considers the diffusioosmosis of an ionic fluid solution in a fibrous system 
constructed of an array of long parallel cylinders, the applied electrolyte concentration gradient 
can be taken as a combination of its transverse and longitudinal components with respect to the 
orientation of the cylinders.  Hence, the problem can be divided into two subproblems, if it is 
linearized, and they can be separately solved.  The overall diffusioosmotic velocity of the fluid 
solution can be obtained by the vectorial addition of the results for the two components.  
Recently, the problems of the transverse
25,26
 and longitudinal
27,28
 diffusioosmotic flows of 
electrolyte solutions in a homogeneous array of parallel charged circular cylinders were 
analytically solved using a unit cell model.  This model involves the concept that a uniform 
array of parallel circular cylinders can be divided into a number of identical circular cylindrical 
cells, one cylinder occupying each cell at its center.
7,29-32
  The boundary value problem for 
multiple cylinders is thus reduced to the consideration of the behavior of a single cylinder and 
its bounding envelope.   
In the existing analyses of the longitudinal diffusioosmotic flow of electrolyte solutions in a 
unit cell with a long dielectric cylinder,
27,28
 the effect of radial distributions of the counterions 
and co-ions (or of the electrostatic potential) on the local electric field induced by the imposed 
electrolyte concentration gradient in the tangential direction inside the double layer and/or the 
effect of the ionic convection on the induced electric field caused by the diffusioosmotic flow 
were not considered.  Moreover, the analysis for the case of arbitrary double layer is subject to 
the severe restriction that the zeta potential is sufficiently low (less than about 25 mV) for the 
Debye-Huckel approximation to be acceptable.  However, zeta potentials as high as 100-200 
mV are frequently encountered in practical applications.  
In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the diffusioosmosis of an electrolyte 
solution in an array of identical parallel circular cylinders with a constant prescribed 
concentration gradient in their axial direction.  As in the previous studies, the unit cell model is 
used in the analysis.  The zeta potential or surface charge density of the cylinders is assumed to 
 6 
LR   and 1)0(|| 
 nnL , where L  is the length of the cylinder and 0z  is set at 
the midpoint along the cylinder.  Thus, the variation with the axial position of the electrostatic 
potential (excluding the macroscopic electric field induced by the imposed electrolyte gradient, 
which is discussed in the next section) and ionic concentrations in the electric double layer 
adjacent to the surface of the cylinder can be neglected in comparison with their corresponding 
values at 0z .  That is, the principle of local equilibrium can be used to characterize the 
polarized double-layer structure.

2.1. Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions.  We first need to know the 
electrostatic potential distribution in the electrolyte solution on a plane normal to the axis of the 
cylinder in a unit cell.  If )(r  represents the electrostatic potential at a point with distance r 
from the axis of the cylinder relative to that in the bulk solution and ) ,( zrn  and ) ,( zrn

Here, the quantity )(H b  can be determined as a function of the parameters   and R  
from the above equations knowing that )(H R  .   
Note that, as indicated in Fig. 2, br *1  at the triple junction point of Subdomains II, III, 
and V.  The area of Subdomain V decreases with decreasing value of 2)( bR  and vanishes 
for the case of maximum porosity ( 0 ).  In the limit of minimum porosity ( 1 ), 
Subdomains II, III, and IV all disappear and Subdomain V dominates the area of 1 .    
    Usually, an analytical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the form of eq 3 is 
obtained either for a small zeta potential   or for a large electrokinetic radius R .  An 
advantage of the above analysis is the method to find the potential distribution   for any 
values of  , R  and b . 
 2.3. Solution for the Case of Constant Surface Charge Density.  If the constant surface 
charge density  , instead of the surface potential  , of the cylinder is known, the boundary

that E  is collinear with and proportional to the axially imposed electrolyte gradient

After substitution of eq 28 for u and eqs 8-16 for   into eq 20, the induced electric field 
distribution E can be numerically solved as a function of the dimensionless parameters R ,  , 
 ,  , and Pe.  With the known results of   and E, the diffusioosmotic velocity distribution 
of the electrolyte solution as a function of R ,  ,  ,  , and Pe can be determined from eq 
28 by numerical integrations.  Clearly, 0/

that, for given values of Rr / , R ,  , and Pe, the quantity */Uu  with specified values   
and   is equal to that with the values   and  .  
 
5. Results and Discussion 
The distribution of the macroscopic electric field )(rE  in the fluid solution of a 
symmetric electrolyte in a unit cell containing a charged circular cylinder induced by a 
concentration gradient prescribed axially can be determined numerically after substituting the 
fluid velocity 
*/)( Uru  in the form of eq 28 and the electrostatic potential ( )r  calculated 
from eqs 8-16 into eq 20.  A simple method for this numerical calculation is to make an initial 
guess of the fluid velocity distribution 
*
1( / ) /u r R U  for a given combination of the 
dimensionless parameters  ,  , Pe,  , and R , and to obtain the resulting induced electric 
field 1( / )E r R  from eq 20.  Then, the next result of the velocity distribution 
*
2 ( / ) /u r R U  
can be determined from the double integral involving 1( / )E r R  in eq 28.  If the difference 
between 2 ( / )u r R  and 1( / )u r R  is beyond the tolerable error, then 
*
2 ( / ) /u r R U  is used in eq 
20 to obtain 2 ( / )E r R , and the same procedure is repeated until an acceptable result for the 
velocity distribution is obtained.

concentration, and the magnitude of 
*/Uu  increases with an increase in the magnitude of   
for an otherwise specified set of conditions.  In general, the magnitude of */Uu  decreases 
with increasing value of Pe (and vanishes in the limit of Pe ) for given values of Rr / , 
R ,  ,  , and  .  This relaxation effect on the diffusioosmotic flow is quite significant if 
the magnitude of   is large.  Note that the cases with 10Pe  , which are not likely to exist 
in practice, are exhibited in Figure 6a for the sake of numerical comparison. 
5.3. Average Diffusioosmotic Velocity.  The dimensionless diffusioosmotic velocity of 
the electrolyte solution at the outer boundary of the unit cell, 
*/)( Ubu , and its average over the 
cross section of the cell, */Uu  , are plotted versus the parameter R  in Figures 7a and 7b, 
respectively, at several values of Pe and   for the case of 6  and 25.0 .  The 
dependence of 
*/)( Ubu  or */Uu   on  , R , and Pe is quite similar to that of */Uu  
for a given value of Rr / , and it is not necessarily a monotonic function of R  for given 
values of  ,  ,  , and Pe.  Again, the effect of the electrolyte convection is significant, 
irrespective of the thickness of the electric double layer adjacent to the surface of the cylinder. 
In Figures 8a and 8b, the dimensionless diffusioosmotic velocities */)( Ubu  and 
*/Uu   are plotted, respectively, versus the parameter   at several values of   and   
for the case of 1R  and Pe=1.  The dependence of */)( Ubu  or */Uu   on   and   
is quite similar to that of 
*/Uu  for a given value of Rr / , and it is not necessarily a 
monotonic function of   for fixed values of R ,  ,  , and Pe.  The magnitude of fluid 
velocity in general increases with an increase in the porosity 1  of the array of cylinders, but 
there are exceptions as indicated in Figure 8a.  The direction of the diffusioosmotic flow 
relative to the prescribed electrolyte concentration gradient is determined by the combination of 
the porosity of the array, the zeta potential (or surface charge density) of the cylinders, the 
properties of the electrolyte solution, and other relevant factors.   
Throughout this work we have adopted the mathematical approximation presented in 
 18 
cross section of a unit cell as a function of relevant parameters are presented in detail.  The 
results show that the effect of the deviation of the local induced axial electric field inside the 
double layer from its bulk-phase value and the relaxation effect cannot be neglected in the 
evaluation of the diffusioosmotic velocity of electrolyte solutions in the axial direction of the 
cylindrical cell, even for the case of thin double layer. 
 As for the diffusioosmotic motion of electrolyte solutions in an ordered array of identical 
parallel circular cylinders with an arbitrary thickness of electric double layers generated by a 
transverse electrolyte concentration gradient, the fluid velocity was already obtained in a 
previous work.
26
  For the diffusioosmosis about an ordered array of dielectric cylinders 
oriented arbitrarily with respect to the imposed electrolyte gradient, the relative fluid velocity is 
the vectorial sum of its transverse and longitudinal contributions.

（一）參加會議經過 
     「海峽兩岸工程力學研討會」 (Cross Strait Workshop on 
Engineering Mechanics)是由海峽兩岸各大學輪流主辦，每年舉行一
次，是兩岸間工程力學相關領域之重要學術會議。今（2007）年的
會議是第三屆，由西安交通大學及蘭州大學共同主辦，分別在兩校
會議廳舉行，會期從八月13日至17日共計五天。 
     此次會議共有47篇論文口頭發表，其中院士論壇由兩岸3位院
士各發表1篇，一般論文部份計有44篇。會議期間主要活動除了論文
發表與討論外，還包括參觀活動。此次參加會議的兩岸工程力學學
者專家共有49人，其中來自臺灣22人及大陸各地27人，包括鮑亦
興，林聖賢，朱位秋3位院士，他們並分別就其專長領域各做了30分
鐘的專題演講，內容頗為豐富。 
    筆者此次應邀與會所發表的研究論文「一表面滑移圓柱形粒子
鄰近一平行其軸之平板之緩慢移動及轉動運動」（Slow translation 
and rotation of a slip circular cylinder near a plane wall parallel to its 
axis）被安排在會議正式議程第一天（八月14日）的上午時段中作15
分鐘的口頭報告，並接受與會者之詢問與討論。在休息的時間中，
亦有不少與會人士與筆者繼續就此篇論文的內容交換意見，氣氛熱
烈融洽。 
 
（二）與會心得 
      此次會議，筆者除了發表一篇論文外，亦積極參與議程中之
聽講與討論，頗有獲益良多之感。筆者對於有關輸送現象以及電動
力現象的幾篇論文最感興趣，發現國際間此領域的研究有以下幾個
新的發展趨勢： 
    （1）對於粒子輸送現象之相關研究，已從過去的球形粒子，剛
