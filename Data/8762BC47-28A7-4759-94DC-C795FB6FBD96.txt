Abstract 
The fabrication, optical and field emission properties of ZnO-based nanorod emitters were 
studied. Two novel methods involving gallium doped ZnO nanorods and formation of tip 
structure on the top of ZnO nanorod by oxygen plasma treatment are employed to improve the 
field emission properties of the nanorod emitters. By either of these two methods, the nanorod 
emitters exhibit significantly reduced turn-on field and enhanced field emission factor. The 
morphology, crystal structure and composition of all the nanorods for making emitters are 
characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray 
spectrometer. The nanorods exhibit the highly preferred c-axis orientation single crystal 
structure. The photoluminescence spectra indicate the nanorods have better crystalline structure 
after doping and oxygen plasma treatment. Combination gallium doping process (Ga/Zn molar 
ratio of 1 % in solution) and oxygen plasma treatment (etching time of 60 sec), the tip structured 
Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) nanorod emitters with tip angle of 100º have a turn-on field of 1.99 V/μm 
under a current density of 1 μA/cm2, field enhancement factor of 2465 and stable operation over 
2×104 sec. Such improved field emission properties are attributed to decreased work function 
and sharp nanotips morphology. In addition, the GZO nanorod emitters with tip structure are 
successively and stably operated between the 25  and 100  over 3000 sec℃ ℃  based on the high 
temperature field emission measurement results. They have high potential for practical 
applications in flat panel display and light emitting device in the future.

(Ga(NO3)3‧xH2O, 99.9% purity), respectively. The substrates were placed downward in the 
above solutions at 90  for 2 h℃  to grow the nanorods. After the reaction, the substrates were 
removed respective from the solution, rinsed with deionized water thoroughly and dried using 
nitrogen. 
For making the nanorods with tip morphologies, nanorods were bound on a sputtering target 
by carbon tape and exposed to oxygen plasma for 0, 30, 60 and 120 sec, respectively. For the 
plasma treatment, process pressure and rf-power were maintained at 5x10-2 Torr and 30 W, 
respectively.  
The morphology, size distribution and crystal structure of all the nanorods were investigated 
by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4700I), a transmission 
electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F), and a X-ray diffractor (XRD, Bede D1). The chemical 
composition was estimated by a energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, Oxford ISIS300). 
The field-emission current-voltage (I-V) curves of all nanorod emitters were measured at a 
pressure of 2×10-6 Torr kept by a turbo molecular pump. A copper tip was employed to act as an 
anode with the tip area of 7.09×10-3 cm2 and p-type Si covered with ZnO emitters as an cathode 
with an area of 1cm2. We used micrometer (accuracy of ±1 μm) to adjust the distance between a 
copper anode and nanorod emitters. The distances of the as-grown and other nanorod emitters 
with the anode are 100 and 150 μm, respectively. The field emission properties are affected by the 
anode area and anode-cathode distance based on Filips model19. The turn-on and threshold fields 
are defined at current densities of 1 μA/cm2 and 1 mA/cm2, respectively. The dependence of the 
field emission current on the anode-cathode voltage was recorded using programmable Keithley 
237 picoammeter measurement system. The stability measurements were also carried out for the 
GZO nanorod emitters at temperature of 25, 50 and 100 ℃, respectively. The photoluminescence 
(PL) spectra were obtained using a He-Cd laser (325nm) as excitation source at room 
temperature. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figures 1(a-d) show the FE-SEM morphologies of as-grown ZnO and GZO (Ga/Zn molar 
ratios of 0.2, 1 and 2 % in solution, respectively) nanorod emitters. It can be observed that the 
small quantities of gallium doping would not significantly influence the length and diameter of 
the nanorod emitters. However, for the nanorod prepared with the solution of 2 % Ga/Zn molar 
ratio, it shows very different morphology, significant reduction of number density, length and 
diameter (Figure 1(d)).The higher amount of gallium doping has a great impact on the size, 
morphology and number density of the nanorod emitters. The ZnO nanorods are formed by two 
different processes: nucleation and growth.  The reactions can be explained as follows20-21:

ionic radius of gallium ion (0.62 Å) is smaller than that of zinc ion (0.74 Å). However, the 
intensity of (002) orientation peak of GZO (Ga/Zn molar ratio of 2 %) nanorods is reduced 
probably due to lattice distortion caused by the larger amount of gallium ions. Figure 2(b) shows 
that the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak increases with an increase of the oxygen plasma 
bombardment time up to 120 s. It indicates that the oxygen ions bombardment not only helps to 
form tip structure but also oxidizes of the oxygen vacancies at the ZnO nanorods.

ZnO nanorod emitters with the various oxygen plasma eching times. 
 
The crystalline properties and morphology of the nanorods have been studied using plane 
view TEM observations. The bright field images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) 
pattern and EDS analysis of the as-grown ZnO, GZO (Ga/Zn molar ratio of 2 %) and as-grown 
ZnO after oxygen plasma treatment for 60 s nanorods are shown in Figures 3(a-f), respectively. 
The (002) c-axis interplanar spacing is 2.56 Å (insets in Figures 3(a) and (c)), which is consistent 
with the XRD results. The SAED patterns (insets in Figures 3(a) and (c)) observe that the 
preferred growth of the nanorod is in the [0001] direction. The typical EDS spectrum (Figure 
3(b)), indicates the as-grown nanorods are composed of only Zn and O. No evidence of other 
impurities is found from the spectrum. With further quantitative analysis of EDS, it reveals that 
the atomic ratio of Zn/O is 49.13:50.87, which is close to stoichiometric ratio. The EDS spectrum 
(Figure 3(d)) for the GZO nanorods reveals that the atomic ratio of Ga/Zn is 1.73±0.11 %. Table 
(1) lists the comparison between Ga/Zn molar ratios in the solution and measured Ga/Zn atomic 
ratio. It shows no significant differences between them, which confirms the successful doping of 
gallium ions into ZnO nanorods by solution method. Figure 3(e) shows that the nanorod has a 
small tip, which is consistent with the result of FE-SEM observation and the tip angle 
approximately 100º can be obtained. The SAED pattern (insets in Figure 3(e)) show the preferred 
[0001] growth of the ZnO nanorods. A high resolution images shown in insets of Figure 3(e) 
reveals the tip and side of nanorods have lattice planes with interplaner spaces of 2.54 Å and 2.58 
Å, respectively, indicating the ZnO nanorods are wurtzite structure with [0001] direction. It is 
6 
 
indicating clearly the decreased oxygen vacancy concentration and consequently, the enhanced 
intensity of UV emission during oxygen plasma treatment occurred.

solution (inset show magnify of UV emission areas) and (b) ZnO nanorod emitters 
with the various oxygen plasma etching times (inset show magnify of green emission 
areas). 
 
It was reported that the gallium doped into ZnO nanorods provide much higher electron 
concentration with reduction of resistivity and lowers the voltage drop at the nanorod emitters27. 
On the other hand, the n-type doping can increase the possibility of electrons tunneling by lifting 
the Fermi level and reduced the work function of the nanorod emitters. We measured the carrier 
concentration of gallium doped ZnO nanorods (as listed in Table 1) by traditional Hall Effect 
measurement. The relation between electron concentration and the Fermi level can be written as28

Where n is carrier concentration, m* the electron effective mass, k Boltzmann constant, T

bottom of conduction band, respectively. Using the carrier concentration (n), m*=0.23 m0 (m0 is 
the electron static mass) and EC=4.35 eV for ZnO, the work functions of the GZO nanorod 
emitters with 0.2, 1, and 2 % of Ga/Zn molar ratios in the solution are estimated to be 4.65, 4.57, 
and 4.56 eV, respectively. 
Figures 5 (a) and (c) show the J-E curves of the as-grown ZnO, GZO and oxygen plasma

Based on the above results, we realize that the GZO nanorods (Ga/Zn molar ratio of 1 % in 
solution) with oxygen plasma treatment time for 60 s exhibit the optimum field emission 
properties. The FE-SEM images (inset in the Figure 6(a)) show the tip structure of GZO (Ga/Zn 
molar ratio of 1 % in solution) nanorod emitters, indicating that the GZO nanorods can be easily 
sharpened and exhibit a tip angle approximately 100 º by oxygen plasma treatment for 60 s.  
The J-E curves and F-N plots of nanorod emitters with different etched times are shown in 
Figures 6(a) and (b), respectively. The GZO (Ga/Zn molar ratio of 1 % in solution) nanorod 
emitters with tip angle of 100 º have the best field emission properties among those emitters, 
turn-on field of 1.99 V/cm, threshold field 2.91 V/cm and field enhancement factor 2465, 
respectively. The comparison of field emission properties of nanorod emitters with different 
treatments are listed in Table 3. The results demonstrate that combination of the gallium doping 
and oxygen plasma treatment are able to successfully improve field emission properties of the 
nanorod emitters, which not only reveal the low turn-on and threshold fields and high β value but 
also exhibit good stability.

nanorod emitters can be successively and stably operated between the 25 and 100 . During the ℃

Figures 8(b)-(c).
