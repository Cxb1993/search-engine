 wired network is that the available bandwidth on each assigned link varies not only 
due to the dynamic traffic on the link, but is also influenced by the traffic on the links 
within its interference range using the same channel. 
A.2: Mixed Integer Linear Programming Formulation 
The proposed MILP maximizes the overall network throughput and will obtain the 
channel assignment and routing for each link and node pair, respectively. The 
notations used in the formulation are as follows. 
z C Raw capacity of each channel. 
z W Set of non-overlapping channels. 
z D Set of source-destination (S-D) pairs having non-zero traffic demand. 
z ts,d Traffic load for (s, d) ∈ D. 
z nici Number of NICs node i is equipped with. 
z intf(i,j) Interference link set of link (i, j). 
z degi Node degree of node i. 
z dst ,′  Non-negative continuous variable representing the amount of load 
successfully routed for S-D pair (s, d) ∈ D.

channel w, and is 0 otherwise. 
z winic  0-1 variable that should be 1 if one of node i’s NICs is assigned channel w, 
and is 0 otherwise. 
The objective is to accommodate maximum requested load.

Equation (11) carries out the constraint imposed by (1). More specifically, the 
summation of load of links in intf(i, j) that are assigned channel w (including load on 
(i, j)) can not exceed the raw capacity of channel w if there are any load on link (i, j) 
using channel w (i.e., w jif ),( = 1). If there are no load on link (i, j) using channel w (i.e., 
w
jif ),( = 0), then the left hand side of (11) is not constrained. That is, the maximum load 
of each link in intf(i, j) can be equal to C. Therefore, the summation of load of links in 
intf(i, j) can be as large as raw capacity C multiplied by the number of links in intf(i, j) 
(i.e., |intf(i, j)|). 
 
 
  
B.2: Formulation 
In the cause of solving the problem which has been defined previously, for 
single-channel and single-radio (SCSR) and multi-channel and multi-radio (MCMR) 
environment, two MILP are proposed. The objective of the both MILP maximizes the 
number of accepted requests and will obtain the channel assignment and routing for 
each link and node pair, respectively. The notations used in the formulation are as 
follows. 
z C    Raw capacity of each channel. 
z W    Set of non-overlapping channels. 
z P    Set of multicast requests. 
z bwi   Traffic load of each multicast request i. 
z nici   Number of NICs node i is equipped with. 
z ( ,  )intf i j   Interference arc set of link (i, j). 
z ( ,  )vintf i j   Interference node set of arc (i, j). 
z ( )outdeg u   Node out-degree of node u. 
z ( )deg u   Node degree of node u. 
The objective is to accommodate maximum traffic throughput of the given 
traffic.

Note that iσ  is set to one if every paths from source to destination is bandwidth 
enough for request i. On the other hand, if any link of those paths is deficient in 
capacity to satisfy the incoming request i, iσ  is set to zero. 
 
B.2.1: Single-Channel and Single-Radio 
 The following constraints in this section are based on the single channel single 
interface wireless mesh network. 
 
B.2.1.1 Constraints of building a multicast tree 
 For each multicast group the communication from source to each destination, the 
source node needs several routes to each destination. The edges of those routes form a 
set, which is called multicast-tree. Any multicast-tree is a rooted tree. We define the 
rooted tree as a directed tree with a source node s called root with no incoming arcs, 
and its other nodes with exactly one incoming arc. Each node, except destinations, in 
the multicast-tree has one or several outgoing arcs to ensure that connectivity of the 
 respectively. Here the outgoing arcs from each destination do not be constrained since 
we assume that each destination can forward packet to its neighbors. Equation (3) is 
the conservation constraint for other nodes except source node and destination nodes. 
In other words, the node should have at least one outgoing arcs if it has an incoming 
arc. Equation (5), and (6) are employed to prevent cycle [23]. 
 
B.2.1.2 Constraints of Interference Model and Link Capacity 
 We now have the multicast tree for each multicast group. However, it is not 
sufficient to solve our problem since a matter need to take into consideration is that 
each arc of a multicast tree is capacity enough. In previous section, we have 
introduced our interference model, and the methodology to calculate capacity of each 
link. Thus the following we will define several variables and constants that are 
exploited later. 
(i) , ijz eg  It is a binary constant. It should be one if node z will interfere with 
link ije . Otherwise, it should be zero. 
(ii) , ij
i
z eF   It is a binary variable. It should be one if node z is in the two cases 
below. 
a) Node z interferes with link ije  and more than one of its outgoing 
links belong to multicast-tree i. 
b) Node z does not interfere with link ije  but more than one of its 
outgoing links, whose destination interferes with node z, belong 
to multicast-tree i. 
Otherwise, its value should be zero. 
(iii) 
ije
X  It is a binary variable. It should be one if there is traffic on link ije . 
Otherwise, it should be zero. 
Note the constants and variables we define here use the notation ije  to represent each 
undirected edge in the graph G. This does not conflict with the previous constraints 
which use link but not edge. Using edge instead of link will be easier and intuitional 
while computing the remaining capacity of each link. The following are the 
constraints for variables , ij

Equation (10) ~ (15) are similar to Equation (2) ~ (6) except that the environment at 
this place is multiple channels and multiple interfaces. Equation (10), (11), and (12) 
are the constraints of a multicast-tree for source node, internal nodes, and destination 
nodes respectively. Equation (13) ~ (15) are the constraints to prevent loops or cycles 
happening.  
 
B.2.2.2 Constraints of Interference Model, Link-Channel Capacity, and NIC 
 We have formulated the constraints of our interference model in section 3.2.1.2, 
and those are for single channel single interface environment. For now, in the 
following, we will expand those constraints to conform with the multiple channels 
multiple interfaces environment. In addition to interference model, we have to restrict 
the use of channels and network interface cards to a rational number, i.e. the number 
of channels and network interface cards used by a node or an edge cannot be more 
than the upper bound respectively. For instance, in a network system, there are 10 
available channels and each node has 2 NICs. If a node A which uses channel 1 and 
channel 2 to transmit traffic to its neighbor, node B, and node C respectively, node A 
cannot use the other channels expect channel 1 and channel 2 to transmit traffic to its 
any other neighbor which is neither node B nor node C, since it only has two NICs. In

edge e, which connects node u and node v, whose two arcs (u, v) and (v, u) should 
have the identical channel w, and furthermore node u can only exploit this channel, i.e. 
channel w, to transmit the traffic to node v, and vice versa.
