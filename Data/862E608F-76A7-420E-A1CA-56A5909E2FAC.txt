本計畫主持人發展數值黏性造波水槽，用以探討波浪與『剛性潛沒不可透水結構物』的
互制，並拓展至更符合實際海岸結構物的『剛性潛沒透水結構物』之計算模式。為廣泛應用
於不規則複雜固體邊界的情形，本模式結合貼壁座標系統（boundary-fitted coordinate 
system），以便於研究波浪通過透水之底床、潛堤或砂漣時，衍生的波形變化與渦流流場。為
提高本模式於國際間的能見度，同時廣納各界對於本數值模式的建議，本計畫主持人於計畫
執行期間與成功大學黃清哲教授及其博士班學生陳志欣合著 Propagation of Solitary Waves 
over Permeable Rippled Beds 並發表於 Proceedings of the Sixteenth (2007) International Offshore 
and Polar Engineering Conference，本研討會於國際性海洋工程學界佔有舉足輕重的角色。文
中主要探討孤立波通過透水與不可透水砂連底床之流場機制。為確立本模式應用於上述流場
的準確性，本文數值結果與前人解析解比對，成果令人滿意。在砂漣底床流場方面，本文可
成功地模擬當孤立波通過砂漣時，於底床附近順逆時針變化的渦流情形，並藉由標示質點隨
流場演變的移動軌跡，探討孤立波對砂漣底床沖刷的可能情形。此結果對於近岸淺水波浪與
底床間互制情形，提供更具體的流場演變機制。感謝國科會於計畫期間的補助，使本論文得

Huang et al. (2003) proposed the following Navier-Stokes type 
equations that govern pore flows and the matching conditions at the 
interface of the water and porous structure.  They are only briefly 
summarized below.

where u  and v  are the horizontal and vertical velocity components in 
the Cartesian coordinates ( , )x y , t  is the time, p  is the hydrodynamic 
pressure and υ  is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.  fC  is a 
dimensionless turbulent resistance coefficient, 1 (1 ) /w m wS n C n= + −  
is the inertial coefficient and 
mC  is a coefficient of added mass.  The 
velocity in the above equations is the discharge velocity, equals to the 
seepage (or Darcian) velocity divided by the porosity, and is physically 
understood as a spatially averaged quantity.  The left-hand-side terms 
in Eqs. (2) and (3) denote the inertial force per unit volume, while the 
right-hand-side terms represent the total forces acting on the fluid per 
unit volume.  The first term on the right-hand-side is the force caused 
by the pressure gradient.  The second term denotes the viscous force, 
which may become increasingly important near the interface between 
the porous media and outside flows.  The last two terms represent the 
effect of the fixed solid skeleton; with the linear term governing the 
low Reynolds number flow and the square law term dominating the 
high Reynolds number flow. 
 
The boundary conditions at the interface are the continuity of the 
velocities and the continuity of normal and tangential stresses 
(Deresiewicz and Skalak, 1963).  They can be expressed as

the subscript “ w ” denotes the physical variables in the water region, 
while “ p ” denotes those in the porous media. 
 
For the solutions to Eqs. (1) and (3), the permeability coefficient pK , 
the nonlinear resistance force fC , and the inertial coefficient S , must 
be determined.  According to McDougal (1993), if the porosity wn  
and the stone size d  of the rubble structure are known, pK  can be 
determined as follows

The inertial coefficient S  needs also to be determined from the 
experiment.  It was often taken as unity in analysis and practice.  In this 
study, S was taken as 1, too. 
 
NUMERICAL METHODS 
 
To make the computational meshes consistent with the rippled beds, the 
boundary-fitted coordinate system is used in this model.  The 
curvilinear grid system is generated using algebraic coordinate method 
(Thompson, 1985).  The physical domain ( , )x y  is transformed into the 
computational domain ( , )ξ η .  To transform the equations of motion 
from the familiar orthogonal coordinates, ( , )x y , to the new coordinate 
system, ( , )ξ η , partial transformation was used.  This means that only 
the independent coordinate variables were transformed, leaving the 
dependent variables (i. e. the velocity components) in the original 
orthogonal coordinates.  This approach has the advantage that the 
resulting equations are relatively simple and the results can be easily 
interpreted. 
 
The Navier-Stokes equations for the flow outside the breakwater and 
the model equations for porous flows were first non-dimensionalized 
and discretized using finite-analytic method (Chen and Patel, 1987).  
The Marker and Cell (MAC) and its modified version SUMMAC 
(Chan and Street, 1970) were used in combination to calculate the free 
surface boundary.  The SIMPLER algorithm was used to calculate the 
coupled velocity and pressure fields.  A staggered numerical grid was 
used.  A successive over-relaxation factor, about 1.2, was used to 
accelerate the speed of convergence in the SIMPLER algorithm for the 
pressure.  To adequately interpret the boundary conditions at the 
interfaces between water and the permeable rippled bed, numerical 
grids were distributed along both sides of the interfaces and the variable 
values at these grids were determined carefully to match the interface 
boundary conditions, Eqs. (4) to (7).  Detailed information relating to 
the method for implementing the match conditions at the interfaces 
refers to Huang et al. (2003). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Verification of the Numerical Scheme 
 
In order to verify the accuracy of the numerical scheme, the numerical 
results for the spatial distribution of wave amplitude on both the 
2495
  
two instants induced by a solitary wave of / 0.15i oH h = .  The 
geometry of the ripples studied in Case 1 and Case 2 can be expressed 
as

πξ ξ
λ= −  (13a)

cos( )

In these figures the time is normalized as 1/ 2( / )
o
t g h  and set to zero 
when the wave crest reaches the beginning of the wavy wall, namely at 
/ 106.5
o
x h = .  To make the flow field in the porous bed visible, the 
scale ratio is indicated in the figure, e.g., scale ration = 3 in Fig. 4 (a).  
We note that when the wave crest propagates onto the impermeable 
ripple section, * 1.10t = − , flow separation with reattachment was 
formed at the lee side of each ripple crest.  The flow separation 
develops gradually into a clockwise vortex with dimension covers the 
whole region between two successive ripple crests, * 2.63t = .  The size 
of the vortex decays spatially in the wave propagation direction.  The 
generated vortices are then lifted up and induced a secondary counter-
clockwise vortex at the weather side of the ripple crest, * 10.71t = .  The 
strengths and dimensions of the secondary vortices are much less than 
the primary vortices.  However, these periodically arranged vortices 
seem to induce a current in the opposite direction of wave propagation, 
* 15.69t = .  This current locates above the ripples and may play an 
important role for the sediment transport as the sands are lifted to 
suspension by the primary vortices.
