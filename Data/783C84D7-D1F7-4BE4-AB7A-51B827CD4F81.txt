2microwave performances, are favorable to
employ in low noise amplifiers (LNA) [14-15].
However, poor linearity is usually found in
HEMTs’characteristics.
In this project, InGaP/ InGaAs double
doped-channel field-effect transistor (DDCFET)
and InGaP/InGaAs double-channel high
electron mobility transistor (DCHEMT), based
on GaAs substrates, have been studied. The
double channels are used to increase the
effective thickness of channel and thus obtain
flat and wide operation regions in device
characteristics. [16] In the DDCFET, two
-doped sheets, formed inside the channels and
employed as carrier supply layers, are
introduced to reduce the impurity scattering
effect, which improves the microwave
performances [17-19]. In the DCHEMT, three
-doped sheets, formed outside the channels
and also employed as carrier supply layers, are
used to make the carrier distribution more
uniform, which increases linearity in the device
characteristics. The DCHEMT shows
comparable device linearity to the DDCFET.
RF performances of the DDCFET are
comparable to those of DCHEMT. In both
device characteristics, high turn-on voltages
Von, high breakdown voltages VBD and low gate
currents IG are observed due to the employment
of InGaP insulators as gate Schottky contact
layers, and high temperature operation
capabilities are also found.
III. Experiments
The studied devices were grown on
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrates
by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD). The detail structures are shown in
Table I. After the epitaxial growth, drain-source
ohmic contacts were formed on the n+-GaAs
cap layers by alloying the evaporated
AuGe/Ni/Au metals at 350 ºC for 30s. Wet
chemical etching process was used for device
isolation. Gate Schottky contacts with gate
length of 1 m were achieved by evaporating
Au metal on the exposed In0.49Ga0.51P insulators
after the cap n+-GaAs layers were removed for
both devices.
IV. Results and Discussion
InGaAs/GaAs lattice-mismatched material
system has been applied widely in transistors
due to its higher mobility, higher peak electron
velocity and lower effective mass of InGaAs
material. However, device characteristics are
limited by the critical thickness and indium
mole fraction of the InGaAs layer [20]. The
identical features of the studied devices are the
use of double channel structure to increase the
effective thickness of the InGaAs channel and
still maintain the In mole fraction of InGaAs at
20%. Wide-gap In0.49Ga0.51P material is also
employed in the studied devices due to its low
DX centers and low oxygen reactivity to
improve device reliabilities. The corresponding
conduction-band diagrams of the studied
devices are illustrated in Fig. 1. The reference
origin of the depth axis is defined as the top
position of the InGaP gate insulator layers. The
large conduction band discontinuity EC at the
In0.49Ga0.51P/In0.2Ga0.8As interface (0.38 eV)
offers a good carrier confinement. The upper
In0.49Ga0.51P layers in the studied devices can
improve the Schottky characteristics, and the
lower In0.49Ga0.51P layers can suppress the
leakage currents through the substrates.
Gate-drain current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics of the studied devices at 300K
and 450K are shown in Fig. 2. The turn-on
voltage Von and gate current IG as a function of
temperature at VGD=-15 V are revealed in the
inset of Fig. 2. The Von is defined as the
gate-drain voltage at which IG equals to
1mA/mm. Von values are 1.74 (1.41) and 1.46
(1.25) V for DDCFET (DCHEMT) device at
T=300K and 450 K, respectively. The high Von
can reduce the forward leakage current,
improve the output current and enlarge the
forward gate voltage swing. The Von of
DCHEMT is lower than that of the DDCFET. It
4V. Conclusion
InGaP/InGaAs DDCFET and DCHEMT,
based on GaAs substrates, have been fabricated
and studied. Due to the InGaP insulator layers
and InGaAs double channels, both device
characteristics exhibited high turn-on voltages,
high breakdown voltages, low gate currents,
flat and wide operation regions, and low
degradation rates. The double-doped sheets in
the DDCFET reduced the impurity scattering in
channels and improved the microwave
performances. The triple -doped sheets in the
DCHEMT caused a uniform carrier distribution
and an improved device linearity. Both devices
can provide the promise for high-temperature
and high-performance microwave circuit
applications.
