中文摘要 
 
本計畫的主要目標在於了解訊號傳輸的時變延遲特性對動態系統強韌特性的影
響；計畫中，吾人特別針對具時變延遲項之離散時間線性非時變系統，及具時變
延遲項之連續時間「漢米爾頓」非線性系統提出判別系統強韌性的方法。 
 
  針對具時變延遲項之離散時間線性非時變系統，吾人提出以操作子理論中之
「二次積分不等式限制分析法則」來推導強韌性判別法則。以這種方法，系統被
視為一線性非時變系統與一延遲差分項之迴路聯結。吾人只要推出延遲差分項之
二次積分不等式限制，即可藉由相關定理推導強韌性判別法則。在本計畫中，吾
人基於時變延遲之長短與時變率有上限的假設下，發展了一些創新的二次式積分
不等式限制，並以數值範例探討由這些限制發展出來之判別法則的適用性。 
 
  針對具時變延遲項之連續時間「漢米爾頓」非線性系統，吾人則以「李亞普
諾夫」方法推導強韌性判別法則。在這個研究主題，吾人同樣假設時變延遲之長
短與時變率有上限。基於這樣的假設，吾人可藉系統之「漢米爾頓」函數推求相
關之「李亞普諾夫」函數，並由此來推導強韌性判別法則。同樣地，吾人以數值
範例探討發展出來之判別法則的適用性；結果顯示，這些判別法則雖然保守，但
已具相當的準確性。

the plant port-Hamiltonian system is connected to a controller
port-Hamiltonian system via a feedback loop such that the
closed-loop system has desired stability properties, by using
various energy shaping techniques. Since the interconnection
preserves the port-Hamiltonian structure, the control by inter-
connection method has some inherent robustness properties
largely due to the structure of the port-Hamiltonian systems.
Now assume that there is some time delay in the communi-
cation between the plant and the controller. The presence of
time delays may often result in a closed-loop system which
is not exactly in the port-Hamiltonian form. In other words
the ”J − R” structure is actually destroyed and hence does
not reveal any information on the stability of the system. This
motivates us to ask the following question: When is a time
delay Hamiltonian system stable?
In the second research direction of this project we analyze
stability of interconnected port-Hamiltonian systems in the
presence of time delays for which we have information on the
upper bounds of the magnitude of the delay and its variation.
Based on these bounds, we derive sufficient conditions for
the interconnected system with time varying delays to be
stable. These conditions are derived based on the construction
of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals by making use of the
Hamiltonians of the individual subsystems.
The content of this report is summarized from our recent
articles [7], [9], which are to be published (in press or
accepted with minor revision) in international journals.
Notations: Symbols R, Rn, Rn×m, and Z+ are used to
denote the sets of real numbers, n-dimensional real vectors,
n ×m real matrices, and nonnegative integers, respectively.
The n×m-dimensional identity and zero matrices are denoted
by In×m and On×m, respectively. When n = m, we will
simply write In and On. The subscript is dropped when the
dimension is evident from the text. For a given matrix A, we
use the notation S(A) to denote A+A′, where A′ denotes the
transposition of A. When A is symmetric, “A > 0” (“≥”,“<”,
and “≤”, respectively) is used to denote positive definiteness
(positive semi-definiteness, negative definiteness, and negative
semi-definiteness, respectively). Given two matrices M1 and
M2, we use diag(M1,M2) to denote the block diagonal
matrix whose (1, 1) block is M1 and (2, 2) block is M2.
Symbol ln2 denotes the space of Rn-valued, square summable
functions defined on time interval [0,∞), and ln2e denotes the
extension of the space ln2 , which consists of functions whose
time truncation lies in ln2 . Given a signal f in the l2 space,
we use ‖f‖l2 to denote the l2 norm of f . Given a bounded
operator G on the l2 space, we use ‖G‖l2 to denote the l2
induced norm of G.
Given a sequence τ : Z+ → Z+, let Dτ denote the time de-
lay operator: (Dτv)[k] := v[k− τ [k]]. The “delay-difference”
operator (I −Dτ ) is denoted by Sτ ; i.e., (Sτv)[k] := v[k]−
v[k− τ [k]]. In this paper, we will exploit the information on
what we called “m-step total variation” of τ , defined as
δm[k] :=
m−1∑
i=0
|τ [k + i+ 1]− τ [k + i]| , k ∈ Z+
To simplify the notation, in the rest of the paper when the
context is clear, we will suppress the time dependency on
τ [k] and δm[k], and simply write them as τ and δm.
For a < b, the Banach space of continuous functions
mapping the interval [a, b] into Rn, with the topology of
uniform convergence, is denoted by c([a, b],Rn). For ψ ∈
c([a, b],Rn), the norm is defined as ‖ψ‖c = supa≤θ≤b|ψ(θ)|,
where | · | is the standard Euclidean norm of Rn. Finally,
cr([a, b],Rn) := {ψ ∈ c([a, b],Rn) : ‖ψ‖c < r}.
For given a continuous function x : [β,∞) → Rn,
the notation x´ denotes the mapping from [β − a,∞) to
c([a, b],Rn) defined as x´[t](θ) := x(t + θ), a ≤ θ ≤ b.
Given a function H(x) : Rn → R, the notations ∇H(x)
and ∇2H(x) are used to denote the gradient vector and the
Hessian matrix of H(x) at x, respectively. Likewise, given
a vector-valued function G(x) : Rn → Rm, the notation
∇G(x) denotes the matrix-valued function

III. THE MAIN RESULTS
In this section we present the findings of this research
project. In this project, we consider the problem of robustness
against varying time delays for two classes of systems: one
is the discrete-time (DT) linear-time-invariant (LTI) system
and the other is the continuous-time (CT) nonlinear port-
Hamiltonian system.
A. Robust Stability of DT LTI Systems with Time-Varying
Delays
We tackle the stability problem of DT LTI systems with
varying time delays using an operator-theoretic approach
called “integral quadratic constraint (IQC) analysis”. In order
for the readers who are not familiar with the IQC analysis to
appreciate the technical contents of the following sections, we
state in this section a stability theorem obtained by applying
the IQC analysis to discrete-time (DT) linear-time-invariant
(LTI) systems with time-varying delays. Consider
x[k + 1] = Ax[k] +Ad(x[k − τ [k]] + f), k ∈ Z+
x[θ] = 0, − Tu ≤ θ ≤ 0
(1)
where the n-dimensional signal x is the signal of interest, f ∈
l2 is a finite-energy external disturbance, A and Ad ∈ Rn×n
are constant matrices. We make the following assumptions
(A1) the delay sequence τ satisfies 0 ≤ Tl ≤ τ [k] ≤ Tu for
all k ∈ Z+;
(A2) there exist nonnegative integers d and m, such that d <
m and the m-step total variation of τ , denoted as δm,
satisfies δm[k] ≤ d for all k ∈ Z+.
System (1) can be equivalently expressed as the feedback
interconnection
x = Gw + e, w = Sτx (2)
where G is an LTI DT system with the transfer matrix
representation1 G(z) = −(zI − (A + Ad))−1Ad , Sτ is the
“delay-difference” operator, and e = −Gf ∈ l2. For the sake
of applying the general IQC theorem, we assume that A+Ad
1We will slightly abuse the notation and use the same symbol to denote
an operator and it’s transfer function representation.

Proposition 1: Suppose τ satisfies Tl ≤ τ [k] ≤ Tu

Proposition 2: Suppose τ satisfies Tl ≤ τ [k] ≤ Tu for all
k ∈ Z+. Furthermore, suppose that there exist nonnegative
integers m and d such that d < m and the m-step total
variation of τ satisfies δm[k] ≤ d for all k ∈ Z+. Then Sτ
satisfies integral quadratic constraints defined by any conic
combination of multipliers Πi, i = 1, 3, 4, 5, defined in Propo-
sition 1, and multiplier Π2 := Ψ′1diag((d + 1)X2,−X2)Ψ1,
where Ψ1 is defined in Proposition 1 and X2 = X ′2 ≥ 0.
Remark 2: IQCs defined by Π1, Π2, Π3, and Π4, are tied
to the l2-gain properties stated in Lemmas 1, 2, 3, and 4,
respectively. That is, these IQCs and various statbility criteria
based on them utlize certain l2-gain properties of Dτ and/or
Sτ . For example, the stability criterion based on the IQC
defined by Π1 +Π3 exploits that ‖Dτ‖l2 ≤
√Tu − Tl + 1 is

B. Robust Stability of Port-Hamiltonian Systems with Time-
Varying Delays
We tackle the stability problem of port-Hamiltonian sys-
tems with varying time delays using Lyapunov approach.
We will begin this part of presentation by introducing the
general Lyapunov stability theorem for systems described by
functional differential equations of retarded type. Consider
x˙(t) = f(x´[t]), (10)
defined on the positive time interval [0,∞), where f : Ω ×
R
p → Rn, Ω ⊆ c([−ξ, 0],Rn) and x´[t] ∈ Ω. The initial
condition of (10) is denoted by x´[0], and it is also a function
talking values in Ω. We assume that (10) has a unique solution
for any initial condition x´[0] ∈ Ω and that x(t) ≡ 0 (the zero
function) is a solution of (10). The concept of internal stability
of the solution x(t) ≡ 0 of (10) is given below.
Definition 1: The solution x(t) ≡ 0 of (10) is called stable
if for any ǫ > 0 there exists a δ(ǫ) > 0 such that for
any initial condition x´[0] which satisfies ‖x´[0]‖c < δ(ǫ),
the corresponding solution x(t) satisfies |x(t)| < ǫ for all
t ≥ 0. It is called asymptotically stable if it is stable and
δ(ǫ) can be chosen such that ‖x´[0]‖c < δ(ǫ) implies that
limt→∞ x(t) → 0. It is called globally asymptotically stable
if it is asymptotically stable, and for any initial condition x´[0]
the corresponding solution x(t) approaches 0 as t → ∞, no
matter how large ‖x´[0]‖c is.
A corner stone for studying internal stability of (10) is
the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem. The theorem is briefly
summarized below. The readers are referred to [4], [11] for
details. Let V : Ω→ R. The derivative of V with respect to
time along a solution x of (10) is defined as
V˙ (x´[t]) = lim sup
∆t→0
1
∆t
(V (x´[t+∆t])− V (x´[t])).
We have the following theorem for stability of the au-
tonomous system (10).
Theorem 2: (Lyapunov-Krasovskii) Suppose that for any
given r > 0, f defined in (10) maps cr([−ξ, 0],Rn) into a
bounded set in Rn. Let w1, w2, w3 be continuous nonnegative
nondecreasing functions which satisfy w1(0) = w2(0) = 0,
and w1(s) > 0 w2(s) > 0 for s 6= 0. If there exists V : Ω→
R such that V and the time derivative of V along the solution
of (10) satisfy
w1(|φ(0)|) ≤ V (φ) ≤ w2(‖φ‖c), and V˙ (φ) ≤ −w3(|φ(0)|)
for all φ ∈ Ω, then the zero solution x(t) ≡ 0 of (10) is
stable. If, in addition, w3(s) > 0 for any s 6= 0, then the
solution x(t) ≡ 0 of (10) is asymptotically stable. Finally, if
lims→∞ w1(s) =∞, then the stability is global.
As usual, stability of any nonzero equilibrium x∗, can be
studied as the stability of the zero solution x(t) ≡ 0, by
“shifting the equilibrium” to the origin.
Port-Hamiltonian systems: In this project, we are interested
in stability of interconnection of nonlinear systems, called
port-Hamiltonian systems, with a specific structure which is
of the form
x˙ = (J(x) −R(x))∇H(x) + g(x)u
y = g(x)′∇H(x) (11)
where x(t) ∈ Rn is the state vector at time t and u(t) ∈ Rp
is the control action. H : Rn → R+, which is sometimes
termed “total stored energy”, satisfies H(0) = 0, ∇H(0) = 0,
and H(x) > 0 for all x 6= 0. g : Rn → Rn×p is called
“the port matrix”. J : Rn → Rn×n and R : Rn → Rn×n
satisfy J(x) = −J(x)′ for all x and R(x) = R(x)′ ≥ 0
for all x 6= 0. J(x) and R(x) are often referred to as “the

where MH(x), MP (x), MΨ(x), and MΦ(x) are defined in
(18) to (20).
Proposition 4: Under assumption A2, the system (17) is
stable w.r.t. x(t) ≡ 0 if there exist symmetric and positive
definite matrices P and Ψi, i = 1, · · · ,m such that
M(x) :=F (x)′(MH(x) +MP (x))F (x)+
MΨ(x) < 0, ∀x ∈ Rn,
(22)
where MH(x), MP (x), MΨ(x) are defined in (18) and (20).
Proposition 5: Under assumption A3, the system (17) is
stable w.r.t. x(t) ≡ 0 if there exist symmetric and positive
definite matrices P and Φi, i = 1, · · · ,m such that
M(x) :=MH(x) +MP (x) +MΦ(x) < 0, ∀x ∈ Rn, (23)
where MH(x), MP (x), MΦ(x) are defined in (18) and (19).
Remark 3: Note that inequalities (22) and (23) are special
cases of inequality (21). More precisely, one recovers (22)
and (23) from (21) by setting Φi and Ψi to zero, respectively.
Thus, criteria stated in Propositions 4 and 5 are more conser-
vative than the criterion in Proposition 3. This is expected
since under assumptions A2 and A3, less information is
available to us. Without information on the upper bounds of
τ˙i(t) and τi(t), we lose the terms MΦ and MΨ, respectively.
Moreover, notice that (2, 2) to (m+1,m+1) diagonal blocks
of MH(x) +MP (x) +MΦ(x) are (di − 1)Φi, i = 1, · · · ,m,
respectively. Thus, di < 1 is necessary for stability condition
(23) to hold.
IV. EXAMPLES
In this section, we provide numerical examples to illustrate
the theorems we presented in Section III-A and III-B.
A. DT LTI Systems with Time-Varying Delays
Theorem 1 equipped with IQCs described in Propositions 1
and 2 renders a set of stability criteria for time-delay system
(1). We have performed a series of numerical experiments
on these criteria. The results are presented here to show the
effectiveness of the proposed analysis method.
Consider the following discrete-time system with a time-
varying delay
x[k + 1] =
[
0.8 0
0.05 0.9
]
x[k] +
[−0.1 0
−0.2 −0.1
]
x[k − τ [k]]
This academic example was considered in [5], [13], [16].
Assuming the rate of variation is arbitrarily, the results
presented in Table I are obtained by applying the proposed
IQC analysis, utilizing IQCs defined by Π1+Π3, Π4, and Π5,
respectively, and compared against those given by stability
criteria proposed in [5], [13], [16]. The rightmost column
shows the number of decision variables involved in each
criterion. We note that most of the problems were solved
in seconds, and the longest computation time we observed
was about one minute. Evidently, utilizing the IQC defined by
Π1+Π3 renders the most conservative criterion. However, the
number of decision variables involved in the corresponding
LMI condition is only 9, which is order-of-magnitude smaller
than those involved in the other criteria. Accuracy of analysis
is traded with computational efficiency. On the other hands,
utilizing the IQC defined by Π4 or Π5 renders the least
conservative criteria3, outperforming state-of-the-art criteria
in almost all cases as shown in Table I. However, the numbers
of decision variables involved in these criteria are several
hundreds – a price we pay to gain superiority in accuracy.
If we further assume that the m-step total variation of
τ is less than or equal to m − 1 (and thus the average
variation is strictly less than 1), then the IQC defined by Π2
becomes applicable. The results of utilizing the IQCs defined
by Π2+Π3 and Π2+Π4 are presented in Table II. First of all,
if we compare results of using Π2 + Π3 with those of using
Π1+Π3, we observe that the predicted stability boundaries are
all improved (and much improved in some cases). Comparing
results of using Π2 + Π4 with those of using only Π4,
we observe that the stability boundaries are all improved.
Secondly, we observe that for m = 2, the stability boundaries
predicted by IQC analysis utilizing Π2+Π3 (which has only
9 decision variables) are mostly better than those predicted
by [5], [13], [16]. Since the constraint on the average variation
of τ was not introduced in [5], [13], [16], this is not a fair
comparison; nevertheless, it shows that the idea of bounding
the total and average variation of τ is a useful concept which
may lead to less conservative analysis.
B. port-Hamiltonian Systems with Time-Varying Delays
To illustrate our results, let us consider the equation of a
normalized undamped pendulum
x¨1 + sinx1 = u, y = x˙1 := x2
3For this particular example, IQC defined by Π4 or Π5 renders the same
results as those obtained using the combination of all five multipliers.

V. CONCLUSIONS
We take an operator-theoretic point of view to stability
analysis of discrete-time linear systems with varying time de-
lays, and propose to tackle the problem via integral quadratic
constraint (IQC) analysis. Under this framework, the system
is viewed as feedback interconnection of an LTI operator and
the so-called “delay difference” operator, for which we derive
several novel IQCs based on the assumption that the time-
varying delay parameter and its variation are bounded. A
set of new stability criteria emerges as the result and their
effectiveness are examined via numerical experiments. The
results indicate that the approach we propose is in many cases
outperforms the state-of-the-art criteria in the literature.
Furthermore, we propose a methodology to test stability
of nonlinear time delay systems in the port-Hamiltonian
framework. Sufficient conditions for stability are derived by
construction of appropriate stability certificates. To illustrate
use of the main results, an example is presented in detail
with a set of margins for stability found and simulations to
verify these margins. A few issues however remain open.
One issue is how conservative the proposed method is and
how to improve it. Simulation results indicate that utilizing
only the bounds on τ(t) and τ˙ (t) could be conservative at
times. Another important issue is how to solve the state-
parameterized matrix inequalities in an efficient fashion.
VI. SELF EVALUATION
The expected outcomes and key performance index as
stated in the project proposal were:
• Develop stability and stabilizability criteria for dynam-
ical systems with time-varying delays, for both the
continuous-time and discrete-time settings.
• Implement the theorems as software package in MAT-
LAB language.
• Publish at least one conference and one journal articles.
The above mentioned goals have been successfully achieved.
As we have presented in this project report, we have
1) developed robustness criteria for discrete-time LTI sys-
tems with varying time delays;
2) developed robustness criteria for continuous-time port-
Hamiltonian systems with varying time delays;
3) implemented these criteria and numerically compared
them against those in the literature;
4) submitted these results to international journals and the
two manuscripts have been accepted [7], [9].
We have also extended our results to aperiodic sampled-data
systems. The scientific findings of this line of research is not
included here due to space limitation; however, the findings
are proven to be novel and have been presented in
• 2011 American Control Conference, San Francisco,
USA citation [8].
In addition to these, we have also done research that are not
directly related to “robustness against time-varying delay”,
but are within the scope of analysis of large-scale distributed
networked systems, which is the core motivation of this
project. The results of this line of research (not included in
this report) have been submitted to and accepted by IEEE
Transactions on Automatic Control [6].
In summary, through this research project, three articles
have been accepted to be published in international journals
(IEEE TAC and IET CTA), and one article has been presented
in important international conferences. Finally, this project
has trained and provided financial support for several Mas-
ter’s students.

Positive Realness of a Set of Matrix-Valued Time-Varying Uncertainties
Chung-Yao Kao and Hisaya Fujioka
Abstract— The manuscript is concerned with characteri-
zations of a set of matrix-valued, time-varying, uncertain
multiplication operators. The set of uncertain multiplication
operators arises from robust stability analysis of systems
with aperiodic sampling-and-hold devices, where the sampling
periods are assumed to be bounded within a given range.
Conditions under which the uncertain operator is positive real
are identified. Based on the positive real property, a number
of quadratic constraints are derived for the uncertain operator.
Such quadratic constraints are proven to be useful in analyzing
robustness of aperiodic sampled-data systems against variation
of sampling intervals.
I. INTRODUCTION
Consider the state space system
x˙(t) = Ax(t) +Bu(t)
where x and u respectively denote the state and the control
input taking values in Rn and Rm. A and B are two real-
valued matrices of comparable dimensions. We assume the
system is operated under the following scenario:
• Measurements of states are taken at time instances
t = τ [k] (k = 0, 1, · · · ) where {τ [k]} is a sequence
of unknown real numbers satisfying
τ [0] = 0, 0 < θ ≤ τ [k + 1]− τ [k] ≤ θ¯ <∞,
where θ and θ¯ are two given constants.
• The control input u is determined by the feedback rule:
u(t) = Fx(τ [k]), ∀ t ∈ [τ [k], τ [k + 1]).
Under the scenario stated above, the resulting feedback
system has the form
x˙(t) = Ax(t) +BFx(τ [k]), ∀ t ∈ [τ [k], τ [k + 1]). (1)
Systems of such form are called “aperiodic sampled-data
control systems”. Applications of such system model can be
found in networked and/or embedded control systems (see
[1], [2] and references therein), where resources for mea-
surement and control are limited. In view of the widespread
of use of networked and embedded control systems, robust
stability analysis of system model (1) against variation of
sampling intervals is both theoretically and practically im-
portant. Various approaches for analyzing such robustness
property have been proposed in the literature; see, for exam-
ples, [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].

Most existing results are based on the classical Lyapunov the-
orem, by either explicitly or implicitly constructing various
kinds of Lyapunov functions. In contrast, operator-theoretic
approaches receive relatively less attention; some previous
results are found in [7], [12], [13], [14]. In [14], system (1)
is transformed to a feedback interconnection of a linear-time-
invariant discrete-time system and a time-varying uncertain
multiplication operator, and a stability condition based on
the small gain theorem is proposed.
In this manuscript, we aim at refining the stability condi-
tion proposed in [14]. The key idea is to identify properties
of the uncertain multiplication operator useful to robustness
analysis of the aperiodic sampled-data system. In particular,
we are interested in the so-called “positive real” property
of the uncertain multiplication operator. Conditions under
which the uncertain operator is positive real will be derived.
Based on the positive real property, a number of quadratic
constraints are derived for the uncertain operator. Such
quadratic constraints are proven to be useful in analyzing sta-
bility of systems with aperiodic sampling-and-hold devices.
The remaining manuscript is organized as follows: the
rest of this section is devoted to introducing notations and
terminologies that will be used throughout the manuscript.
The exact problem formulation is given in Section II and
important characterizations of the spectrum of the uncertain
operator are presented in Section III. Integral quadratic
constraints which characterizes the positive real property of
the uncertain operator are derived in Section IV. Finally,
we give examples which demonstrate how the positive real
property is helpful in stability analysis in Section V and draw
a few concluding remarks in Section VI.
NOTATIONS AND TERMINOLOGIES
Symbols R, R+, Rn×m, C, C+, Cn×m, and Z+ are
used to denote the sets of real numbers, nonnegative real
numbers, n ×m real matrices, complex numbers, complex
numbers with nonnegative real part, n×m complex matrices,
and nonnegative integers, respectively. Given a matrix M ,
the transposition and the conjugate transposition of M are
denoted by M ′ and M∗, respectively. The spectrum of M
is denoted as eig(M). The notation M > 0 (“≥”) is used to
denote positive definiteness (positive semi-definiteness).
Symbol lm2 denotes the space of Cm-valued, square
summable functions defined on time interval [0,∞). In this
manuscript we consider the usual norm and inner product
functions for l2 space, which are denoted as ‖·‖l2 and 〈·, ·〉l2 ,
respectively. Likewise, given an operator H on l2 space, the
l2-induced norm of H is denoted by ‖H‖l2 A bounded linear-
time-invariant (LTI) self-adjoint operator Π on the l2 space
2, · · · , q. Clearly,
S−1∆(θ)S =

eJnq (λq)ηdη

 .
Furthermore, each
∫ θ
0
eJni (λi)ηdη is a upper triangular ma-
trix, whose diagonal entries are equal to θ if i = 1, and equal
to (eλiθ − 1)/λi if 2 ≤ i ≤ q. Finally, since the spectrum of
a matrix is invariant under similarity transformations, we see
that the spectrum of ∆(θ) consists of θ, which corresponds
to the zero eigenvalue of A, and (eλiθ − 1)/λi, which
corresponds to the eigenvalue λi of A, i = 2, · · · , q. This
concludes the proof.
Now consider the following subset of C
P := {a+ jb : |b|e
3api
2|b| ≤ |a|, a < 0} ∪ R+ (9)
An illustration of the set can be found in Figure 2. The
conditions under which eig(∆(θ)) ∈ C+ are given in the
following propositions.
Proposition 1: eig(∆(θ)) ⊂ C+ for all θ ∈ R+ if and
only if eig(A) ⊂ P.
Proof: Let λ := a + jb ∈ eig(A). Following Lemma 7
we know that the corresponding eigenvalue of ∆(θ) is either
equal to θ if λ = 0, or equal to e
(a+bi)θ−1
a+bi if λ 6= 0. In the
latter case, the real part of the complex eigenvalue is equal
to
R(θ) =
1
a2 + b2
(
a(eaθ cos bθ − 1) + beaθ sin bθ
)
.
Note that R(0) = 0 and dRdθ (θ) = e
aθ cos bθ. Hence, if b =
0, dRdθ (θ) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈ R+ which in turn implies that
R(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈ R+. This proves that eig(∆(θ)) ∈ C+
if eig(A) ∈ R.
Suppose b 6= 0. It is then easy to verify that R(θ) has
local minimums at θk = 3+4kpi2b if b > 0 or θk =
−(3+4kpi)
2b
if b < 0, k ∈ Z+. The corresponding local minimums are
R(θk) = −a+ be
aθk sin bθk = −a− |b|e
3api
2|b| e
2api
|b|
k
Clearly, if a > 0, R(θk) < 0 for all k ∈ Z+. This proves
that, if a > 0 and b 6= 0, then the real part of e
(a+bi)θ−1
a+bi is
negative for some θ ∈ R+.
Finally, suppose b 6= 0 and a < 0. Then clearly
min
k∈Z+
R(θk) = R(θ0) = |a| − |b|e
3api
2|b|
and therefore R(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈ R+ if and only if
|b|e
3api
2|b| ≤ |a|. Combining all cases together, we conclude
that R(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈ R+ if and only if λ ∈ P. This
concludes the proof.
Proposition 2: Suppose eig(A) ∩ Pc 6= ∅, where Pc =
C\P. Then eig(∆(θ)) ⊂ C+ for all θ ∈ [0, θ0], where
θ0 = min
λ∈eig(A)∩Pc
θ˘(Reλ, Imλ) (10)
and θ˘(a, b) is the greatest lower bound of the following set{
θ : θ > 0,
1
a2 + b2
(
a(eaθ cos bθ − 1) + beaθ sin bθ
)
< 0
}
.
Proof: Let λ := a + jb ∈ eig(A) ∩ Pc. Denote
the eigenvalue of ∆(θ) corresponding to λ as λ∆(θ). By
Proposition 1, we know that
Reλ∆(θ) =
1
a2 + b2
(
a(eaθ cos bθ − 1) + beaθ sin bθ
)
and Reλ∆(θ) < 0 for some positive θ. Hence θ˘(Reλ, Imλ)
is well defined. Furthermore, from the proof of Proposition 1,
we also know that Reλ∆(0) = 0 and the derivative of
Reλ∆(θ),
dReλ∆
dθ
(θ) = eaθ cos bθ,
which is nonnegative for θ ∈
[
0, pi2|b|
]
. Thus, by continuity
we know that Reλ∆(θ) ≥ 0 for θ ∈ [0, θ˘(Reλ, Imλ)].
Having established this, it is now clear that eig(∆(θ)) ⊂ C+
for all θ ∈ [0, θ0], where
θ0 = min
λ∈eig(A)∩Pc
θ˘(Reλ, Imλ).
A conservative estimate of θ0 is given in the following
proposition.
Proposition 3: Suppose eig(A) ∩ Pc 6= ∅, where Pc =
C\P. Then eig(∆(θ)) ⊂ C+ for all θ ∈
[
0, pi2b0
]
, where
b0 = maxλ∈eig(A)∩Pc |Imλ|.
Proof: Following the arguments in the proof of Propo-
sition 2, we know that Reλ∆(0) = 0 and
dReλ∆
dθ
(θ) ≥ 0, ∀θ ∈
[
0,
π
2|b|
]
.
Thus, Reλ∆(0) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈
[
0, pi2|b|
]
. This concludes the
proof.
Proposition 2 provides a mean to estimate an upper bound
of θ for which ∆(θ) is passive. The algorithm involves
finding all eigenvalues of A which locate in Pc and the cor-
responding θ˘. For a λ ∈ eig(A) ∩Pc, a good approximation
of θ˘(Reλ, Imλ) can be easily found by sweeping θ over a
dense grid of
[
pi
2|b| ,
3pi
2|b|
]
. Actually, numerical experiments
indicate that θ˘(Reλ, Imλ) is usually just slightly larger than
pi
2|b| .
IV. POSITIVE REALNESS OF ∆(A, θ) AND THE
CORRESPONDING INTEGRAL QUADRATIC CONSTRAINTS
In this section, we consider the multiplication operator
∆(A, θ) : v 7→ w defined in Section II
w[k] = (∆(A, θ)v) [k] = ∆(θ[k])v[k] (11)
Moreover, note that〈[
v
w
]
,Π3
[
v
w
]〉
l2
=
∫ pi
−pi
[
vˆT (e
jω)
wˆT (e
jω)
]∗ [
0 X(ω)
X∗(ω) 0
] [
vˆT (e
jω)
wˆT (e
jω)
]
dω
=
q∑
i=1
∫ pi
−pi
(2δi cosψi(ω))vˆT,i(e
jω)∗Xi(ω)vˆT,i(e
jω)dω
(17)
Since the eigenvalues of A are all real, by Lemma 1 all
δi are larger than or equal to zero. Furthermore, Xi(ω) =
Xi(ω)
∗ ≥ 0 and ψi(ω) ∈
[
−pi2 ,
pi
2
]
for all i and for all ω ∈
[−π, π]. Therefore, the integrant of integral (17) is greater
than or equal to zero for all ω ∈ [−π, π], which in turn
implies that 〈[
v
w
]
,Π3
[
v
w
]〉
l2
≥ 0
and ∆(A, θ) satisfies IQC defined by Π3. Finally, again,
taking X as the identify matrix (all Xi(ω) = I and all
ψi(ω) = 0 ∀ω) shows that T−1∆(A, θ)T is positive real.
To end this section, we provide for ∆(A, θ) an integral
quadratic constraint characterization that comes from the
upper bound of ‖∆(A, θ)‖l2 , and the general IQC theory
by which one can use to derive stability conditions for the
(Σ,∆) feedback system.
Theorem 4: Suppose 0 < θ[k] ≤ θ¯. Then ∆(A, θ) satis-
fies integral quadratic constraint defined by the multiplier
Π4 =
[
γ2e−A
∗ξe−Aξ 0
0 −e−A
∗ξe−Aξ
]
(18)
where ξ is any real number and
γ =
∫ θ¯
0
eµ(A)ηdη, µ(A) := λmax
(
A+A∗
2
)
.
Proof: See [14].
Theorem 5 (IQC): Consider the (Σ,∆) feedback system
shown in Figure 1. Assume Σ is stable and there exists a
constant θ¯ such that 0 < θ[k] ≤ θ¯. Suppose
1) ∆(A, θ) satisfies the IQC defined by Π;
2) Π11 ≥ 0 and −Π22 ≥ 0;
3) there exists ǫ > 0 such that[
Σ(ejω)
I
]∗
Π(ejω)
[
Σ(ejω)
I
]
≤ −ǫI, ∀ ω ∈ [−π, π].
Then the feedback interconnection of Σ and ∆ is stable.
Proof: The theorem presented above is completely ana-
log to that of [15], where the continuous-time systems were
considered.
V. EXAMPLES
In this section, we show how helpful the positive real
property is in reducing conservatism of stability analysis by
two examples.
Example 1: Let A = 0, B = 1, F = − ε
h0
, where 0 <
ε≪ 1. Let τ [k+1]− τ [k] = h0+ θ[k], where 0 ≤ θ[k] ≤ θ¯.
With these values, we have
Φ(h0) = e
Ah0 +
(∫ h0
0
eAηdη
)
BF = 1− ε
Ψ(h0) = AΦ(h0) +BF = e
Ah0(A+BF ) = −
ε
h
∆(θk) = θk
and the discrete-time system Σ has the form
Σ[z] = −
ε
h0
1
z − 1 + ε
.
Note that
Σ[ej0] = −
1
h0
,
Σ[ejφ0 ] = j
ε
h0
1
sinφ0
, cosφ0 = 1− ε, 0 < φ0 < π,
Σ[ejpi] =
ε
h0
1
2− ε
.
Thus we have
ReΣ[ejω] < 0, |Σ[ejω]| >
ε
h0
1
sinφ0
, ∀ω s.t. cosω > 1− ε,
ReΣ[ejω] ≥ 0, |Σ[ejω]| ≤
ε
h0
1
sinφ0
, ∀ω s.t. cosω ≤ 1− ε.
Hence by the small gain condition proposed in [14], which
is equivalent by applying Theorem 5 with IQC defined by
Π4, one obtain the upper bound θ¯ as
‖Σ‖−1l2 = h0.
On the other hand, with the positive real property of
∆(A, θ), we may apply Theorem 5 with IQC defined by
Π1 + Π4 (with T = I in Π1). In this case, the stability
condition becomes: there exists x ≥ 0 and ǫ > 0 such that
θ¯2|Σ[ejω]|2 − 1 + 2xReΣ[ejω] ≤ −ǫ, ∀ ω ∈ [−π, π].
It can be readily verified that, for the above stability condition
to hold, the upper bound θ¯ must satisfy the constraint
θ¯2
(
ε
h0
1
sinφ0
)2
< 1, ⇔ θ¯ <
h0 sinφ0
ε
= h0
√
2− ε
ε
.
Since ε ≪ 1, clearly, one obtain a much better bound for
θ[k] if the positive real property of ∆(A, θ) is taken into
account.
