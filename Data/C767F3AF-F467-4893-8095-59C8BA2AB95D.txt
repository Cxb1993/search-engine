cost can be saved.
(5) A novel mental poker protocol. Detail is given in this report.
All previous secure mental poker protocols are based on ANDOS (All-or Nothing
Disclosure of Secrets) as the crucial part since Crépeau’s protocol in 1987. ANDOS
is the most computational expensive part of the protocol. In [18], researchers
attempted to use another principle to replace ANDOS. The proposed protocol is
very efficient. Unfortunately, it has a serious security flaw which was pointed out
by [6]. A modified protocol is presented in [17] repairs this problem, but once again,
a new security flaw was found by [7].
In this paper, we present an efficient TTP-free mental poker protocol which
does not use ANDOS. To avoid possible security flaws, we prove our protocol is
secure against polynomial time adversaries. Our proposal shuﬄes 7x∼20x faster
than proposals using similar encryption scheme in typical situations. The length of
total message send between players during the shuﬄe is also reduced to 6%∼52%
compares to those of previous protocols.
2. Setting
Assume the card game is played by N players with a deck ofM cards. Cards are
enumerated as Card 1, Card 2,. . . , Cardm,. . . , CardM and players are enumerated
as Player 1, Player 2,. . . , Playerm, . . . , PlayerM . Players are modeled as auxiliary
input Turing machines and can communicate to each other via reliable and safe
private channels and open channel.
G be a cyclic group, and g be a generator of G. Let H be a multiply subgroup
of Z∗/ |G| and h is a generator of H. K > 0, (G, g) and (H,h) are the parameters
of our protocol. Also let I = Z∗/ |H|.
Assume that G and H are chosen from families of groups that satisfy DDH
assumption. Moreover, assume (G, g),(H,h) can be efficiently generated and the
order of |G| and |H| are known. Our protocol can be proved to be secure when
K ≥ 4. The security of our protocol is not known for for smaller K. However, we
conjecture that our protocol is also secure for K = 1, 2, 3.
An example implementation of (G, g), (H,h) is to find primes r, p, q such that
r = 2p+1 and p = 2q+1. Then let G = QR (Z/r), and H = QR (Z/p), where QR
means the quadratic residue group.
3. The Protocol: Basic Elements
3.1. Barnett-Smart Style Protocol. The basic structure of our protocol the
same as Barnett-Smart’s (see [2] for more detail). It have four sub-protocols: Deck
Initialization, Shuﬄe, Card Drawing and Card Opening.
Before the game started, players use Deck Initialization to prepare a deck. Then,
players can shuﬄe the deck, and draw/open cards many times in a polynomial time
bound. Players use Shuﬄe to shuﬄe the deck. A player can use Card Drawing to

2: rn←VExpx−1n (rn−1, gn, g0)
3: end for
return rN
3.3. Deck Initialization of Castellà-Roca. Fix distinct 〈cm〉1≤m≤M , where cm ∈
H. A pair(a, b) is a face up representation of Card m if logb a = cm. (gcm , gxS ) is a
face down representation of Card m. cm does not need to be random and is known
to all players.
To initialize a deck, players use the following protocol.
Protocol 5 Deck Initialization: Init
1: 〈gn〉 , [xn]← KeyGen . generate public and private keys
2: Players cooperatively choose distinct c1, c2, . . . , cM ∈ H
3: β←Enc (g0, 〈gn〉 , [xn])
return 〈(gcm0 , β)〉, 〈cm〉
3.4. Deck Initialization of Modified Castellà-Roca. Our protocol can be con-
sidered as
Protocol 6 Init2
1: 〈am,0, bm,0〉, 〈cm〉← Init
2: for n = 1 to N , Player n do
3: for m = 1 to M do
4: rm,n← rand

)
5: Broadcast am,n← arm,nm,n−1
6: Other players should verify that am,n 6= 1.
7: Broadcast bm,n←VExpr (bm,n−1, am,n−1, am,n)
8: end for
9: end for
return 〈(am,N , bm,N )〉1≤m≤M
3.5. Basic Shuﬄe. In Castellà-Roca’s protocol, In Castellà-Roca’s protocol, a
card is represented by a pair (a, b) ∈ G2 . The value of the card (a, b) is determined
by logb aK , where K is the shared private key. The shuﬄe of the modified Castellà-
Roca’s protocol is the same as Wang-Wei, except that Mix-up is replaced by the
following
Procedure 7 Mix-up a deck with y and pi: Mix-up(〈(am, bm)〉1≤m≤M , y, pi)
Require: pi is a permeation of {1, 2, . . . ,M} ;

4. The Protocol: our contribution
4.1. Deck Initialization. Players use the following protocol to prepare a deck.
Protocol 13 Deck Preparation
1: Using Init2 to generate D0 = 〈(am, bm)〉1≤m≤M , 〈cm〉m≤M
2: Players generate random h = 〈h1, h2, · · · , hK〉 ∈ HK .
3: Generate a random g0 ∈ G.
4.2. Operators. Before further description of the protocol, let us define notions
on componentwise operations,
ab = a · b
= (a1, a2, · · · , ak) · (b1, b2, · · · , bk)
= (a1b1, a2b2, · · · , akbk)
ar = (a1, a2, · · · , ak)r
= (ar1, ar2, · · · , ark)
ra = (ra1, ra2, · · · , rak)
Fix δ = (δ1, δ2) be some pair of elements of H (which players will joint generated
later in Shuﬄe Setup). Let a, a′, b, e, g ∈ G and f = (f1, f2, · · · , fΛ) ∈ HΛ. Define
the ∗ operation as following
(y, z, w) ∗ ((a, a′, b, e, g), f)
= ((aδ
w
1 , a′δ
w
2 , bz, e, g)y, ζw · f).
Note that ∗-operation has nice homomorphic property
(y2, z2, w2) ∗ ((y1, z1, w1) ∗ ((a, a′, e, g), f))
= (y1y2, z1z2, w1 + w2) ∗ ((a, a′, b, e, g), f).
During the shuﬄe, each card is represented in the form ((a, a′, b, e, g), f).
4.3. Shuﬄe. Shuﬄe contains 5 parts. Wrap-AWrap-B Shuﬄe-main, Reveal-Secrets,
Check-Secrets, Unwrap-Deck.

Shuﬄe-Main is the same as basic shuﬄe with above shuﬄe procedure.

At step 5 of SP and step 1 of Shuﬄe-Main, we pick a card ((a, a′, b, e, g), f) from
a deck. It does not matter which card is picked. The “g-component” of every card
in a deck is the same.

4.7. Unwrap a Deck.
5. Security Proof
5.1. Introduction. Alice, Bob, N = 3. Bob is Player 2.
5.2. A Generalized DDH Assumption. In this subsection, we prove a gener-
alized version of DDH assumption. In fact, it is a generalization of the generalized
DDH assumption appeared in [1]. It can also be considered as a useful special case
of (P,Q)-DDH, which is introduced by Bresson, Lakhnech, Mazaré, and Warinschi
in [4]. We prove Theorem 1 below directly from the standard DDH assumption.
Recall that G is a cyclic group of order p. GK can be considered as a K-
dimensional vector space over the finite field Zp. Since we use multiplicative nota-
tion for group operation, the vector “addition” of two vectors 〈a1, a2, . . . aK〉 and
〈b1, b2, . . . , bK〉 is 〈a1b1, a2b2, . . . , aKbK〉. Similarly, the scalar “multiplication” for
a λ ∈ Z/p and a vector 〈a1, a2, . . . , aK〉 is
〈
aλ1 , a
λ
2 , . . . , a
λ
K
〉
. A linear combination
of vi ∈ GK has the form
∏
vλkk , where λi ∈ Z/p are the coefficients. A set of
vectors {v1, v2, . . . , vN} is said to have rank r, if their linear span is r-dimensional.
Moreover, let (λl,k) ∈ (Zp)J×K be a J by K matrix. (λl,k) can be considered as a
linear transformation GK → GJ which maps 〈ak〉1≤k≤K to
〈∏K
k=1 a
λj,,k
k
〉
1≤j≤J
.
In this notation, DDH assumption says that random {(g0, a) , (b, c)} is indistin-
guishable from random {(g0, a) , (b, c)} with rank 1. We have the following gener-
alization.
Theorem 1. (Under DDH assumption) If r1, r2 > 0, then random v1, v2, . . . , vN ∈
GK with rank r1 is indistinguishable from random v1, v2, . . . , vJ with rank r2.
Proof. The case for J = 1 is trivial. Consider the case J = 2. Let A : G2 → GK be
a random linear transformation from G2 to GK with rank 2. Let v1 = A ((g0, a))
and v2 = A ((b, c)). The rank of v1, v2 is the same as the rank of (g0, a) , (b, c).
Therefore, if random v1, v2 with rank 1 and with rank 2 are not indistinguishable,
then we can solve the DDH assumption. Thus, random v1, v2 ∈ GK with rank 2 is
indistinguishable from random v1, v2 ∈ GK with rank 1.
Suppose J > 2. Given any u1, u2 ∈ GK , we can construct vj = uαj1 uβj2 for
all j ≤ J , where αj , βj are random. Since vj is the linear combination of a and
b, the rank of {vj}j≤J is the same as the rank of {u1, u2}, except for negligible
probability. Thus, {vj} is indistinguishable from random vectors of rank r, where
r is the rank of u1, u2. Since it is infeasible to determine the rank of u1, u2, random
v1, v2, . . . vJ ∈ GK with rank 1 is indistinguishable from random v1, v2, . . . vJ ∈ GK
with rank 2.
The rest of theorem can be proved by induction (on the rank). Suppose r <
min (J,K) and v1, v2, . . . , vJ ∈ GK with rank r−1 is indistinguishable from v1, v2, . . . , vJ ∈
GK with rank r. Let v′j = vλjvj , where v ∈ GK , λj ∈ Z/p are random. Since the
rank of {vj} is less than K, the probability of v in the linear span of {vj} is neg-
ligible. Moreover, except for negligible probability, the linear span of
{
v′j
}
is the
same as the linear span of {vj}
⋃ {v}. Thus, {v′j} is indistinguishable from random
vectors with rank r′ + 1, where r′ is the rank of {vj}. Therefor, if random vectors
with rank r and random vectors with rank r + 1 are not indistinguishable, then
random vectors with rank r − 1 and with rank r are not indistinguishable. This
contradicts to the induction hypothesis. 

Therefore, U, V are random variables independent to

(s1, t1) is not a solution.
By a graph theory results, this implies that there can have no more that |H| 32
