一、前言 
近年來，能源危機及環境污染的議題相當受到重視，許多替代性的能源被予考慮並迅速蓬
勃發展。其中氫氣就已被廣泛地應用在半導體工業製程、化學工業、鋼鐵工業、航太工程、
實驗室以及交通運輸工具等方面，做為原料、燃料、攜帶性能源或是其它用途；氫燃料電池、
氫動力汽車的開發更是未來發展的重點，至於生物醫療科技方面，超微量氫氣感測系統以偵
測人體呼吸氣息來探討各種機能異常現象也大受重視。然而，氫氣安全性仍是消費者、使用
人所最疑慮之因素之一，特別是於半導體工業製程、化學工業，交通燃料方面，當空氣中的
氫氣濃度大於 4.65%時，就有爆炸的危險性。因此，基於安全性的考量，如何發展高效能的
氫氣感測器來準確地檢測洩漏的氫氣及即時監控，就為當前極為重要的課題。基於不同偵測
原理與適用條件等，各式各樣的氫氣感測器長久以來便被廣予開發且上市。其中又因半導體
工業製程日益普及與能源問題日趨嚴重，更有積極開發該高效能氫氣感測器的急迫性與需求
性。對於半導體式氫氣感測器而言，因其具備輕薄短小、積體化、智慧化、商業化、可攜式
及整合性等優勢，因此可廣泛應用於各領域。 
相對於半導體式感測器，其中更又以場效應元件如金半、金氧半蕭基二極體，場效應電晶
體挾其製作簡單，相容性高而最受矚目。一般而言，這些場效應式感測器，以現今普遍使用
的化合物半導體如 GaAs系列、InP系列、GaN系列材料做為感測平台，而以催氫金屬如鈀、
鉑、鎳等為感測金屬，兩者接觸而簡單形成蕭基式二極體，雖然這些場效應式感測器之感測
機制仍眾說紛紜，但目前所廣予接納的感測機制有如：含氫氣體吸附於催氫金屬表面，經過
解離作用將氫分子解離為氫原子，接著氫原子可快速擴散通過催氫金屬層而到達感測平台與
感測金屬介面，因此由於氫原子受到介面電場極化而形成偶極層，進而改變了原有蕭基接面
的位障高度並產生額外之感測電流。由於可製作為感測平台的材料很多，因此相關發表的文
獻也不少，先進國家如美、日、德等均有許多研究團隊極力推動此類半導體式蕭基效應元件，
不過由於文獻太多，將擇要綜合分析比較如次。 
在感測特性方面：無論是所謂的MS或MOS元件，在無氫環境下之電流/電壓輸出曲線均具
有整流特性，如圖一虛線所示，一旦該元件處於含氫氣體氛圍，氫分子的吸附、解離、擴散
與定位形成偶極層，造成蕭基接面位障降低與感測電流的產生，如圖一實線所示，此一感測
特性仍呈整流特性。但值得注意的是，大部分的文獻資料顯示多偏好將操作特性偏壓在順向
工作區，如此一來衍生以下不希望的特性。對於即時、原位監控而言，感測器一旦處於待命
狀態下，順偏壓工作下的順向電流構成不必要的功率消耗，一般而言，即便小順偏壓電壓，
如 0.3Ｖ，也將造成數百到數千倍於反向飽和電流者。偏壓電路的穩定性，造成製作成本的提
高，此乃因在順偏壓工作，如 0.3Ｖ時，即時有些微的電壓浮動，乃至雜訊電壓的干擾，也容
易造成輸出電流的改變，以致錯動感測，造成不必要之處置動作，浪費人、物力。操作電壓

二、研究目的 
基於目前蕭基研究現況所遇可能之困難或尚待突破的瓶頸，本計畫則實質上透過感測特
性，簡化元件製作，調整感測機制並積體化感測放大器而達到下列目的： 
1、提供一完全平面式蕭基氫氣感測器，使其具有雙向/對稱感測特性。 
2、提供一完全平面式蕭基氫氣感測器並相容於各式電子元件以奠定積體化感測放大器之實
現。 
3、提供一可形成類三維偶極層(Three-dimensional like dipole layer)的氫氣感測器並建立完全
創新的感測機制。 
4、建立另類的感測機制，突破現有感測結構上的限制，以期提供同一領域學者，專家研發高
性能氫氣感測器。 
5、提供多孔化催氫金屬/氧化物體層(A bulk mixture of metal and oxide)的簡化製程。 
6、提供多孔奈米催氫金屬粒的簡化製程，優利於製成高效能感測器。 
7、提供超低含氫氣體的感測元件，優利於生物醫療。 
8、製作一氫氣感測元件期可同時用於洩漏監控和濃度鑑定 
9、提供一低功率散逸氫氣感測器，可即時、原位監控各項持用氫能源的設備。 
10、積體化ＨＢＴ與氫氣感測元件，用於低功率氫氣感測放大器。 
氫氣大量使用於如半導體製造工業，氫能源廣泛取代現有石油等能源勢必成為全球趨勢，
而在可成熟地應用於日常生活，並為廣大群眾接受之前，除氫能源製造/貯存等技術建立完整
外，安全性的考量也是目前最大的疑慮之一。不容否認國內、外相關產業無不積極扮演各自
重要角色，促進對於氫氣感測器之改善或突破對於目前市場需求度之限制，除部分醫療體系
外，國內也僅有少數學校發展，基於本計畫一改現有的結構、機制、製程和積體化技術，所
產生重要功效有：完全平面式蕭基感測器的完整分析，可以提供產學具實質致力於積體化感
測放大器的設計、製作，對於氫氣感測領域在技術上層面次的提升有正面助益。全新感測機
制的理論驗證，可以開啟另一世代氫氣感測器，或可帶動更多更高效能的氫氣感測器研發產
品上市。奈米催氫金屬粒材料研發成功，不但可實際應用在氫氣感測器上，相對於奈米材料
而言，或可提供催氫效應不同的現象以及其他氣體間選擇性之探討。可培育氫能相關的科技
人才，以投入能源相關的產業。超微量氫氣感測電路研發，或可建立其在生物科技方面的基
礎，提供相關領域之整合研究。 
 
三、文獻探討 
文獻[1]係第 1篇以催氫金屬鈀，結合MOS結構所開發出來的半導體式氫氣感測器，感測機制
也同時在這篇文章中揭露，對照現今各式各樣的半導體式氫氣感測結構、原理機制等，好像並沒
有特別令人印象深刻的衝擊影響，卻仍被視為半導體式氫氣感測器之開山祖師，造就了後續MS
系氫氣感測器的蓬勃發展。此時二氧化矽就是扮演閘介電層，氧的角色幾乎不受注意。 
文獻[2]-[5]則係成大研發半導體式氫氣感測器系列文章之一，說明MS系氫氣感測器可採用不同
的半導體[2]-[4]且果然產生不錯的感測特性。又、同時該團隊發現將MS系的蕭基層表面予以氧化

Schottky electrodes.
and GaN, respectively. Compared to commonly used MS- and
MIS-sensors, MSM-sensors exhibit key features as: (i) reduced pro-
cessing steps; (ii) elimination of noblemetals for ohmic electrodes;
(iii) bi-directional and symmetrical sensing performance; and (iv)
requirement of only a single lightly doped layer and hence being
easily integrated with other electrical/optical devices. The device
structure and fabrication are described in the next section. The
sensing mechanism of a MSM sensor compared to that of a MS one
was also introduced. In section 3, sensing performance including
sensing current–voltage characteristics, dynamic responses, and
switching behaviors were addressed and investigated. Finally, a
conclusion was made.
2. Experiments and sensing mechanisms
2.1. Experiments
Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional diagram of a Pd/GaN MSM
sensor fabricated with two multi-ﬁnger Schottky electrodes. The
originalGaN/AlGaNhetero-bipolar-transistor (HBT) epitaxial struc-
ture was employed and grown on c-plane (0001) sapphire
substrates by a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)
system. It consisted of a 1.2m GaN buffer layer, a 1.8m n+-
GaAs subcollector doped to 5×1018 cm−3, a 0.6m collector layer
doped to 3–5×1016 cm−3, a 0.18m p+-Al0.2Ga0.8N/GaN superlat-
ticed base layer doped to 2×1018 cm−3 (carrier concentration of
∼2×1017 cm−3), a 0.06m n-Al0.2Ga0.8N emitter layer and ﬁnally
a 0.11m n+-GaN cap layer. The device fabrication started with
complete removal of the cap, emitter, and base layers using a high-
density plasma etching system. After a device mesa process using
the same system, a solution of HF:H2O=1:1 was used to remove
the native oxide on the exposed GaN collector layer. Two Schottky
electrodeswithmultiple ﬁngerswere formedby thermally deposit-
ing a 35nm Pd thin ﬁlm. The thickness was monitored in situ
with a quartz crystal head (MAXTEK TM-350). Both of the ﬁnger
width and ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger spacing were 5m. The total effective
area of the Schottky electrode for sensing was 8×10−4 cm2. The
goal of using the HBT epitaxial structure was to demonstrate that
the MSM hydrogen sensor could be easily integrated with other
electrical/optical devices required. Hydrogen detectionwas carried
out at room temperature using a homemade gas-sensing cham-
ber of 235-ml volume. Hydrogen-containing mixtures of 1080,
4890, and 10,100ppm H2 in N2 gas were used in this experiment.
Current–voltage and dynamic response measurements were car-
ried out by mounting the sensors on a test ﬁxture with bonding
wires contacting to both of the Pd Schottky electrodes.
2.2. Sensing mechanisms
For a conventionalMShydrogen sensor shown in Fig. 2, the sens-
ing current density (JH2) in a H2 ambience is generally expressed
as:

concentrations in N2 at room temperature.
N2. Both forward and reverse current densities are smaller than
4×10−9 A/cm2 at Vbias = ±1.5V. This implies that the effective
barrier height available in N2 is at least higher than 0.88V, indi-
cating that good Schottky contacts were achieved. Concerning the
sensing characteristics of the MSM sensor, current densities are
substantially enhanced with introduction of hydrogen-containing
gases. This means that the MSM conﬁguration with two multi-
ﬁgure electrodes is also suitable for applying to hydrogen sensors
with good detecting capability. For a commonly used MS hydro-
gen sensor, rectifying behaviors are observed in both air/N2 and a
hydrogen-containing ambience. Besides,MShydrogen sensors usu-
ally fail to detect when a positive Vbias larger than 1V is applied
(i.e., a narrow spread forward-operating-voltage regime). How-
ever, symmetrical behaviors in I–V characteristics are observed for
our MSM sensors in both N2 and hydrogen-containing ambiences.
Sensing current densities measured are 6.52×10−7 (6.60×10−7),
3.68×10−7 (3.9×10−7), and 2.11×10−7 (2.09×10−7) A/cm2 at
Vbias = +1.5 (−1.5)V when 10,100, 4890, and 1080ppm hydrogen-
containing gases are introduced, respectively. Clearly, such a
voltage-polarity independent characteristic is beneﬁcial in design-
ing new sensing ampliﬁers. Fig. 5 shows the change in the barrier
height of the MSM sensor upon exposure to different H2 concen-
trations in N2 at room temperature. According to Eqs. (6) and (8),
the effective barrier-height variation (BR) of the MSM sensor
studied is directly calculated to be VTln(JH2/JN2). When the hydro-
gen concentration is increased, the effective barrier height of the
MSM sensor is decreased. It is because more hydrogen atoms can
be absorbed at the Pd/GaN interface to form a polarized layer when
more hydrogen molecules come to the front Schottky electrodes.
This polarized layer causes a signiﬁcant barrier-lowering effect as
reported previously. On the other hand, it is found that the BR is
independent of the Vbias applied between two Schottky electrodes
when hydrogen concentration is ﬁxed and Vbias is somewhat larger
than 0.3V. Note that the symmetrical behaviors in the BR vs.
Vbias characteristics were also observed. The symmetrical voltage-
independentBR explains that (i) current densities both inN2 and
in a hydrogen-containing ambience are dominated by the reverse
biased diode, MSR, in a MSM sensor and (ii) the dipoles formed at
the Pd/GaN interface are almost saturated by the built-in ﬁeld at
equilibrium. The saturated BR’s (S’s) are 131 (157), 116 (87), and
102mV (51) in 10,100, 4890, and 1080ppm H2-containing gases,
respectively. According to the I–V related performance experimen-
tally ﬁnished, it is concluded that (i) symmetrical and bi-directional

MSM hydrogen sensor at different Vbias. Listed in the inset are the corresponding
response and recovery times.
sensing characteristics are really obtained in the MSM device con-
ﬁguration, (ii) voltage-independent barrier-height variations and
hence responses with widespread voltage-operating regimes are
expected using aMSM sensor, and (iii) the origin of failing to detect
in a forward-biased MS sensor is due to the substantially reduced
electric ﬁeld and the sensing mechanism developed in the above
section well describes those important results about both MS and
MSM sensors.
3.2. Dynamic responses
Fig. 6 shows the transient response curves of the MSM sensor
to the introduction and removal of 1080, 4890, 10,100ppm H2/N2
gases at room temperature. Our experiments were not focused on
the effects of increasing temperature but on the effects of the Vbias
applied between two Schottky electrodes on both response and
recovery times. The response time is deﬁned as the time that the
current density reaches from JN2 to (1 − e−1)JN2,sat, while the recov-
ery time is deﬁned as the time that the current density from JH2,sat
to e−1 × JH2,sat. It is found from the inset in Fig. 6 that both hydro-
gen concentration and appliedVbias (i.e., electric ﬁeld) play very few
effects on the response time. In case of a ﬁxed hydrogen concentra-
tion of 1080ppm in N2, the response time is almost independent
of Vbias and is as short as 38±2 s. When the hydrogen concentra-
tion in N2 is increased to 10,100ppm, there is only several-second
reduction in response time (30±3 s). Although other experimental
results in Ref. [24] addressed that the higher the hydrogen con-
centration the shorter the response time, there is no signiﬁcant
evidence showing that the hydrogen concentration or the Vbias
affects the response time of the MSM sensor. On the contrary, the
recovery time exhibits a dissimilar attribute to the response time.
Considering again the effects of hydrogen concentration in N2, it is
found that the recovery time is shorter in 10,100ppm compared to
that in 1080ppm at the same Vbias. Besides, it is also longer with
increasing Vbias for a ﬁxed hydrogen concentration. Experimental
conclusions are (i) the time needed to form a dipole layer does not
seem to be related to Vbias if the electric ﬁeld is large enough and (ii)
when the hydrogen-containing gas is removed, theH atoms formed
as the dipoles are more difﬁcult to escape within a higher electric
ﬁeld.
Since it is highly desirable to develop a sensitive and reliable
sensor being able to detect the leakage of hydrogen, the transient
responses of a MSM sensor upon introducing hydrogen-containing
gases at different ﬂow rates are also presented in this study. Fig. 7

Abstract: This paper reviews both static and dynamic characteristics of a planar-type Pd-GaN 
metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) hydrogen sensor. The sensing mechanism of a 
metal-semiconductor (MS) hydrogen sensor was firstly reviewed to realize the sensing mechanism 
of the proposed sensor. Symmetrically bi-directional current-voltage characteristics associated with 
our sensor were indicative of easily integrating with other electrical/optical devices. In addition to 
the sensing current, the sensing voltage was also used as detecting signals in this work. With 
regard to sensing currents (sensing voltages), the proposed sensor was biased at a constant voltage 
(current) in a wide range of hydrogen concentration from 2.13 to 10,100 ppm H(2)/N(2). 
Experimental results reveal that the proposed sensor exhibits effective barrier height variations 
(sensing responses) of 134 (173) and 20 mV (1) at 10,100 and 2.13 ppm H(2)/N(2), respectively. A 
sensing voltage variation as large as 18 V was obtained at 10,100 ppm H(2)/N(2), which is the 
highest value ever reported. If an accepted sensing voltage variation is larger than 3 (5) V, the 
detecting limit is 49.1 (98.9) ppm. Moreover, voltage transient response and current transient 
response to various hydrogen-containing gases were experimentally studied. The new finding is 
that the former response time is shorter than the latter one. Other dynamic measurements by 
switching voltage polarity and/or continuously changing hydrogen concentration were addressed, 
showing the proposed sensor is a good candidate for commonly used MS sensors. Crown Copyright

gitated Schottky contacts by starting processes with a device
mesa. Then, a mixture of Pd and SiO2 was thermally
codeposited on a 0.6 mm n-GaN [n ¼ ð3{5Þ  1016 cm3]
layer using a conventional evaporator equipped with multi-
ple tungsten boats. As shown in Fig. 1, the interdigitated
Schottky contacts are composed of two multiﬁnger patterns.
Both of the ﬁnger width and ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger spacing are
5 mm. The ﬁrst and second multiﬁnger patterns have an
eﬀective area of 8 104 cm2 for sensing hydrogen-con-
taining gases. The thickness of the evaporated mixture was
monitored using a quartz crystal head in real time. The
expected thickness is 30 nm. Since no ohmic contacts are
required in our MSM sensor, low-cost device fabrication is
expected by eliminating high-price noble metals. Figure 2(a)
shows the secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) proﬁle
showing that the as-deposited mixture is composed of
palladium, silicon, and oxygen. Clearly, a 30 nm mixture of
Pd and SiO2 is intended to be deposited over the GaN layer.
It is worth to note that SiO2 is distributed into a Pd thin ﬁlm.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the as-
deposited Pd and mixture are shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c),
respectively. Compared with smooth dense surface observed
in Fig. 2(b) for the pure Pd metal, the surface morphology
formed by the Pd–SiO2 mixture exhibits much more and
wider pores. Clearly, inserting a bit of SiO2 into Pd brings
about stacked vacancies and interstitial sites, which are
beneﬁcial for hydrogen molecules being dissociated not
only on the surface but also inside the mixture. Hydrogen
detection was carried out at room temperature using a
home-made gas sensing chamber. Various hydrogen con-
centrations from 2.13 to 10100 ppm in N2 were used at a rate
of 500 sccm. The use of hydrogen in nitrogen is to realize the
role of oxygen species on trapping hydrogen atoms.2,3,8,9,13)
Room-temperature sensing characteristics at static [current
versus voltage (I–V) curves] and dynamic [current versus
time (I–t) curves] states were systematically measured using
an HP 4145 semiconductor parameter analyzer by applying a
diﬀerential voltage (V12) between two Ag/Au pads.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Static and sensing responses
Figure 3 shows I–V characteristics of the proposed sensor
subjected to 2.13 to 10100 ppm H2/N2. Symmetrically
bidirectional I–V curves are observed owing to the MSM
diode conﬁguration. Solid lines represent the proposed
sensor being operated in the absence of hydrogen. Both
forward and reverse current densities at V12 ¼ 1:0V are
1:10 106mA/cm2. Basically, there are two MS Schottky
diodes connected back to back in a single MSM diode. When
a diﬀerential voltage V12 is applied, one MS Schottky diode

V12 is expected to bring about the larger internal electric
ﬁeld inside the reverse-biased MS diode. However, the
enhanced internal electric ﬁeld has not contributed to more
dipoles. This implies that the built-in electric ﬁeld of the MS
diode at equilibrium is suﬃciently large for polarizing
hydrogen atoms and explaining why a stable B was
obtained for the reported MS sensors in a wide range of
reverse-biased voltages.1,6) At V12 ¼ 2:5V, B starts to
increase with a voltage coeﬃcient of 55mV/V. Since the
internal electric ﬁeld has no contribution to the formation of
dipoles, a further reduction in barrier height is believed to be
due to hydrogen atoms trapped inside the mixture. Another
important merit employed to assess the static performance of
a gas sensor is the sensing response (S, no unit) deﬁned as
S ¼ JH2  J
J
: ð5Þ
As shown in Fig. 4(b), sensing responses at V12 ¼ 1, 3, and
5V are 1:1 105, 1:8 105, and 3:8 106, respectively, for
the proposed sensor subjected to 10100 ppm H2/N2. Even if
a hydrogen concentration as low as 2.13 ppm is introduced,
the proposed sensor exhibits S values as high as 2:6 103,
4:2 103, and 8:7 104 at V12 ¼ 1, 3, and 5V, respective-
ly. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest values
ever reported. It is also found in Fig. 4(b) that S linearly
increases with hydrogen concentration with a slope of 0.45.
In addition to monitoring the leakage of hydrogen-contain-
ing gases, the proposed sensor can also be used as a detector
for measuring hydrogen concentrations in the wide range of
2.13 to 10100 ppm. If a hydrogen-containing gas with an
unknown concentration HðxÞ has a sensing response SðxÞ to a
sensing current, HðxÞ can be determined as
log
SðxÞ

¼ 0:45 log HðxÞ

; ð6Þ
where H1 and S1 are the baseline values obtained from a
standard hydrogen-containing gas at some a particular V12.
Clearly, such an S versus hydrogen concentration character-
istic is beneﬁcial for designing a new hydrogen-concen-
tration detector with simpliﬁed circuits.
3.2 Dynamic response and response time
Figure 5(a) shows the dynamic responses of the proposed
MSM sensor measured by switching V12 from a positive
voltage of 0.5V to a negative voltage of 2:5V and
performing in ambience cycled from N2 to 10100 (1080)
ppm H2/N2 and then back to N2. When V12 ¼ þ0:5V is
applied, clear sensing characteristics are observed at the time
indicated by a H2-on marker. The hydrogen-containing gas
is allowed to ﬂow through the sensor. After saturation at the
time indicated a H2-oﬀ marker, pure nitrogen is allowed to
continuously through the sensor to remove the absorbed
hydrogen. As a result, recovering characteristics are obtained
and the sensing current decreases to the baseline existing
prior to the introduction of a hydrogen-containing gas. By
switching V12 from +0.5 to 2:5V, clear sensing and
recovering characteristics are also observed at the times
indicated by the H2-on and H2-oﬀ markers, respectively.
These experimental results show that our MSM sensor is
completely reversible and durable. It is also found that V12
exhibits very few eﬀects on ta that is nearly the same as 40 s
at V12 ¼ þ0:5 and 2:5V for the proposed sensor subjected
to 10100 ppm H2/N2. Here, ta is the response time deﬁned
as the time that the increased current density reaches the
(1 e1) current diﬀerence between the saturated and
original currents. This again implies that the eﬀects of the
internal electric ﬁeld on ta can be ignored. However, ta is
increased to 110 s when the proposed sensor is subjected to
1080 ppm H2/N2. Experimental results for the measured ta
are in agreement with those previously reported.1–3,5) The
shorter ta in a higher hydrogen concentration is due to a more
eﬃcient dissociation of hydrogen molecules. Compared with
some other reported results, the response time of the proposed
sensor at room temperature seems to be somewhat long-
er.19,20) The mixture enhances the adsorption and dissociation
of hydrogen molecules, and simultaneously capture, hydro-
gen atoms. Although this is one of the possible origins of the
longer response time, the operation at an elevated temperature
should increase the eﬀect of the hydrogen and hence shorten
the response time.19) This approach is feasible since the GaN
material is capable of operating at a much higher temperature.
On the other hand, an excellent dynamic response to
hydrogen-containing gases is also conﬁrmed by continuous-
ly changing hydrogen concentration from 1080 to 4890 and
then to 10100 ppm H2/N2 at V12 ¼ 5V. Figure 5(b) shows
that the change in hydrogen concentration gives rise to a
rapid stair-like response. It is thus concluded that (1) our
proposed MSM diode with a mixture of Pd and SiO2 can be
used as a sensor to monitor hydrogen leakage and a detector
to measure hydrogen concentration; (2) a wide range of
positive or negative voltages is acceptable for this kind of
sensor in the circuit design; and (3) low power consumption
is expected when considering real-time in situ detection.

on a 0.6 μm n-GaN layer [n = (3–5) × 1016 cm−3]. The
Pd thin film and mixture were deposited by a conventional
thermal evaporator equipped with two tungsten boats. The
background pressure and deposition rates of the mixture and
Pd used for the thermal evaporation are 2 × 10−7 torr and
72 nm min−1, respectively. Both the finger width and finger-
to-finger spacing are 5 μm. The effective area (i.e., one
multifinger area) for sensing hydrogen-containing gases is
8 × 10−4 cm2. A compared MSM sensor with a 35 nm
Pd metal being directly deposited upon the n-GaN layer was
fabricated to exhibit the same device dimension. Figure 2(a) is
the SIMS profile showing that a 20 nm mixture of Pd and SiO2
was deposited upon a 15 nm Pd thin film. Figures 2(b) and (c)
show the SEM images of the sensing metals formed by the
mixture/Pd and Pd, respectively. The surface morphologies
of these two sensing materials are found to be different. The
porous-like morphology with more and wider pores distributed
over the mixture is observed in figure 2(b). In contrast,
a smooth dense surface is observed for the pure Pd metal.
Clearly, mixing SiO2 into the Pd metal brings about stacked
vacancies and hence a porous-like morphology. Typically,
three possible sensing modes take place in the MSM hydrogen
sensor with a porous-like mixture of Pd and SiO2. That is,
hydrogen molecules can be dissociated on the surface, inside
the mixture and at the mixture/Pd interface. Thus, a highly
efficient dissociation of hydrogen molecules is expected.
Room-temperature static and dynamic responses were carried
out by mounting the sensors on a test fixture with bonding wires
contacting both of the Au/Ag pads. Various concentrations

sensor (a), and the compared MSM hydrogen sensor (b) with

of oxygen inside the mixture also prevents hydrogen atoms
from escaping. Thus, more hydrogen atoms trapped inside
the mixture in advance will also reach the Pd/GaN interface
and/or form the dipoles in situ when Vbias increases. It is found
that S (qφB) increases from 8 × 105 (352 meV) to 7.7 × 106
(411 meV) as Vbias changes from −1 to −5 V in a 4890 ppm
H2/N2 ambience.
Figures 5(a) and (b) show dynamic responses of the
compared and proposed MSM sensors, respectively, by
alternately switching Vbias from a positive voltage to a negative
voltage (0.5 to −1.5 to 2.5 to −3.5 V) and performing in
ambiences cycled from N2 to 10 100 ppm H2/N2 and then
back to N2. When Vbias = +0.5 V is applied, clear sensing
characteristics are observed at the time indicated by the H2-on
marker. The hydrogen-containing gas is allowed to flow
through the sensor. After saturation at the time indicated by
the H2-off marker, pure nitrogen flows continuously through
the sensor to remove the absorbed hydrogen. As a result,
recovering characteristics are obtained and the sensing current
decreases to the baseline existing prior to the introduction of
a hydrogen-containing gas. By switching voltage polarity
applied between two Schottky electrodes (Vbias = +0.5 to
−1.5 V), clear sensing and recovering characteristics are also
observed at the times indicated by the H2-on and H2-off
markers, respectively. Measurements on different hydrogen
sensors in the same chip indicate nearly the same performance.
Repeated measurements on the same devices were also
performed after several days. No clear degradation in dynamic
responses was found. The experimental results show that our
MSM sensor is completely reversible and durable. Besides,
the MSM sensors are more suitable for integrating with other
electrical/optical devices due to voltage-polarity independent
sensing performance. It is also found that Vbias plays no effects
on ta ≈ 30 s for the compared MSM sensor. ta is response time
that is required for the increased current density to reach to
a (1 − e−1) current difference between the saturated and the
original currents. A somewhat larger ta ≈ 35 s is measured
for the proposed MSM sensor with a porous-like mixture. It
is reasonable since more hydrogen atoms should pass through
the mixture and arrive at the Pd/GaN interface.
4. Conclusions
A GaN-related MSM hydrogen sensor with a porous-like
mixture of Pd and SiO2 has been fabricated to compare to
a MSM hydrogen sensor with a Pd metal only. Concept of
hydrogen molecules dissociated on the surface, inside the
mixture and at the mixture/Pd interface explains its highly
efficient dissociation for the proposed sensor. High sensing
responses (Schottky barrier height variations) are in the range
of 8 × 105 (352 meV) to 7.7 × 106 (411 meV) as the biased
voltages are in the range of −1 to −5 V for the proposed
MSM sensor in a 4890 ppm H2/N2 ambience.

As shown in the inset, Vbias is found to have no effect on ta and Vbias-
independent ta is 40 s. The measured ta’s indicate no delayed response
when the dipoles are formed in 2D and 3D sensing regions. This is
reasonable since hydrogen atoms are trapped within the mixture in
advance. If the enhanced S is attributed to more 2D dipoles at the inter-
face, a longer ta is expected. Dynamic response again evidences that the
enhanced S is due to 3D dipoles. When the 10100 ppm H2/N2 gas is
removed, it is more difﬁcult for hydrogen atoms to escape at a larger
Vbias (a higher built-in electric ﬁeld). Experimental results reveal that
the tb’s are slightly increased from 95 to 115 s as Vbias increases from
0.5 to 3.5 V. Clearly, the concept of forming dipoles at the interface
(2D) and within the mixture (3D) well explains the I-V characteristics
and dynamic responses obtained from the proposed hydrogen sensor.

SiO2 has been studied. Pd nanoparticles with pores give rise to an
increased surface-to-volume ratio so that improved sensing perform-
ances are expected. In addition, there are three distinct sensing regions
observed in the proposed hydrogen sensor. The concept of forming
dipoles in 2D formation on the GaN surface and in 3D formation
within the mixture is introduced to well explain the I-V characteristics
and dynamic responses observed in our proposed hydrogen sensor.

This paper reports on new GaN sensors using a Pd-mixture-Pd triple-layer sensing structure to enhance
their sensitivity to hydrogen at the tens of ppm level. The proposed hydrogen sensor biased with a con-
stant voltage produced relatively high sensing responses of ∼4.84 × 105% at 10,100 ppm and ∼8.7 × 104%
at 49.1 ppm H2 in N2. The corresponding barrier height variations are calculated to be 220 and 168 mV.
When the sensor is biased by a constant current with maximum power consumption of 0.4 mW, a sensing
voltage as an output signal showed a voltage shift of more than 17 V (the highest value ever reported) at
49.1 ppm H2 in N2. By comparison to Pd-deposited GaN sensors, the improvement in static-state perfor-
mance is likely attributed to double dipole layers formed individually at the Pd–GaN interface and inside
the mixture. Moreover, voltage transient response and current transient response to various hydrogen-
containing gases were experimentally studied. The new ﬁnding is that the former response time is shorter
than the latter one.

1. Introduction
In addition to solar energy, wind energy, and water energy,
hydrogen energy is another possible solution to alleviate energy
crisis resulting from the limited sources of fossil oil. Hydrogen
is abundant and comes from renewable sources, which can pre-
vent the undesired air pollution problems. Hydrogen has also been
employed in the ﬁelds of electronic manufacture, industrial and
medical applications [1]. However, hydrogen is very volatile and
extremely ﬂammable. A small leakage of high concentration of
hydrogen-containing gases could eventually lead to a devastating
state. Thus, a lot of researches about various hydrogen sensors have
been reported over past two decades [2–4]. Many of the group VIII
transition metals such as nickel, palladium, and platinum absorb
hydrogen spontaneously. This absorption alters the electrical and
optical properties of these metals. These alterations have been
exploited for measuring hydrogen-containing gases [5,6]. A num-
ber of palladium- and platinum-based hydrogen sensors have been
demonstrated. Among them, metal–semiconductor (MS) Schottky
diodes [7–13] and metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) [14–18]
diodes are the promising devices for detecting hydrogen-containing
moieties. Commonly accepted sensing sequences for these kinds of

hydrogen sensors are as: the hydrogen molecules are adsorbed and
dissociated at a Pd (or Pt) surface, followed by rapid diffusion of H
atoms to the Pd-semiconductor (or Pd-insulator) interface where
the dipole layer is formed to result in the lowering of Schottky bar-
rier height and the increase of a sensing current. Recently, Chiu
et al. reported a new metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) hydro-
gen sensor [19] and employed a mixture of Pd and SiO2 as the
sensing metal [20]. Unlike commonly studied MS and MIS hydro-
gen sensors, symmetrically bi-directional sensing characteristics
were addressed in their MSM hydrogen sensor. Besides, the dipoles
formed not only at the interface but also inside the mixture were
also proposed. In this paper, sensing characteristics of a new kind
of GaN metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) hydrogen sensor with
double dipole layers formed by a Pd-mixture-Pd triple-layer sens-
ing structure were comprehensively investigated. The mixture used
was Pd and SiO2, the same as that in [20]. We evaluate the hydrogen
sensing characteristics of a Pd-mixture-Pd-deposited GaN sensor at
various hydrogen concentrations and make a comparison to previ-
ous results from a Pd-deposited GaN sensor.

H2/N2, a 600 times the magnitude of JN2 is still obtained. Clearly,
such a voltage-polarity independent characteristic is beneﬁcial in
designing new sensing ampliﬁers. The EBH variation is calculated
by B = VT ln(JH2 /JN2 ). Fig. 4(a) shows B as a function of hydro-
gen concentration ([H2]). The used parameter is Vbias. At a ﬁxed
Vbias = 3 V, the B is increased with increasing the [H2]. The calcu-
lated EBH variations are 220, 204, and 185 mV for the proposed
sensor at 10,100, 1080, and 98.9 ppm H2/N2, respectively. When
the [H2] is reduced to 49.1 ppm, the B is 176 mV. Experimental
results also reveal that the Vbias does not inﬂuence B at a ﬁxed
[H2].
Fig. 4(b) shows the logarithmic sensing response as a func-
tion of [H2] for the proposed sensor at room temperature. The
sensing response deﬁned as (JH2 − JN2 )/JN2 can be calculated by
[exp(BR/VT) − 1]. The used parameter is the Vbias at 1, 3, and 5 V.
In addition to Vbias-independent sensing response (S), the respon-
sive trend versus [H2] is nearly the same as that in Fig. 4(a). It is
reasonable since S is shown in logarithmic scale. So, we ﬁnd that
the S is increased with increasing the [H2]. For example, the S is
increased from 873 to 4842 when the [H2] introduced to the pro-
posed MSM sensor is increased from 49.1 to 10,100 ppm H2/N2.
Furthermore, the proposed MSM sensor subjected to various hydro-
gen concentrations has quite stable and ﬂat curves according to
the plot of sensing response as a function of applied bipolarity
biases. These results together with large breakdown voltages being
available in GaN material reveal that the Pd-mixture-Pd-deposited
GaN hydrogen sensor produces hydrogen sensing properties with
wide positive- and negative-bias regimes. Previously, we reported
that a Pd-deposited hydrogen sensor using the same epitaxial GaN
layer also showed symmetrically bi-directional sensing character-
istics. The Pd-deposited GaN hydrogen sensor produced sensing
responses (EBH variations) of 157 (131 mV) at 10,100 ppm, 87
(116 mV) at 4890 ppm, and 51 (102 mV) at 1080 ppm H2 in N2.
The calculated maximum EBH variation (B,max) and sensing
response (Smax) is 137 mV (194), respectively. By comparison, the
present Pd-mixture-Pd-deposited GaN hydrogen sensor gave sens-
ing responses (EBH variations) of 4842 (220 mV) at 10,100 ppm,
3341 (210 mV) at 4890 ppm, and 2649 (204 mV) at 1080 ppm
H2 in N2. In order to realize possible origins of such improved
properties, we ﬁrstly review the sensing processes occurring in con-
ventional MS- and MIS-type hydrogen sensors. In general, hydrogen
molecules are dissociated into hydrogen atoms when a hydrogen-
containing gas adsorbs at the Pd surface. Some hydrogen atoms
rapidly diffuse through the metal layer to the Pd–GaN (or Pd–SiO2)
interface. Then, these hydrogen atoms at the interface are adsorbed
and polarized to form a dipole layer. The dipole layer alters the
electrical properties of the Pd metal directly upon the interface and
produced the increased current. With regard to our Pd-mixture-
Pd-deposited hydrogen sensor, the lower Pd metal combined with
the GaN layer forms the same Schottky interface as that in MS-
type one. On the other hand, the surface of the upper Pd metal is
responsible for dissociation of hydrogen molecules, which is also
the same as that in MS-type one. Since the dissociation efﬁciency
and interfacial characteristic are compatible for the Pd-deposited
and the Pd-mixture-Pd-deposited hydrogen sensors, the improved
response should not come from the dipole layer formed at the
Pd–GaN interface. Chiu et al. reported that hydrogen atoms can
be possibly trapped inside the mixture of Pd and SiO2 [20]. Schal-
wig et al. also revealed that the hydrogen adsorption takes place
at the semiconductor side where the existence of oxygen at the
Pt–GaN is found [21]. It is likely to be the case for our proposed
hydrogen sensor with a Pd-mixture-Pd triple-layer sensing struc-
ture. The hydrogen atoms dissociated at the upper Pd surface can
be trapped when they diffuse into the mixture with oxygen. Thus
another dipole layer is formed above the lower Pd metal. This is
the ﬁrst disclosure that a dipole layer can be formed above the cat-
alytic metal. Chiu et al. reported ∼40 times the sensing response
when the dipole layer is formed inside the mixture. Our experi-
mental results (157–4842, 87–3341, and 51–2649) seem agreeable
to previous results. It is the ﬁrst ﬁnding that the electrical properties
of the Pd metal are altered by covering with a dipole layer. Based
on experimental results by Chiu and Schalwig et al., another mix-
ture with the Pd replaced by other catalytic metals (i.e., Pt) or SiO2
replaced by other dielectric with oxygen can possibly be employed
in our triple-layer sensing structure. Besides, the sensing struc-
ture together with GaN in nanocrystalline form [13] would be very
promising for low-cost and high performance hydrogen sensors.
Fig. 5(a) illustrates the sensing voltage characteristics which
is an enlarged view of region II marked in Fig. 2. The most left
curve represents current-dependent sensing voltages of the pro-
posed sensor in N2 and others represent those in various [H2]
ambiences. With regard to present measurements, the proposed
hydrogen sensor is biased by a constant current (Ibias) and sens-
ing voltages in response to various hydrogen-containing gases are
output as signals. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the current–voltage charac-
teristics from the proposed sensor were set with maximum power
consumption of 0.4 mW. At the Ibias = −5A, the proposed sensor
in N2 produces a voltage (VN2 ) as high as −38 V. The magnitudes of
sensing voltages (
∣∣VH2
∣∣) reﬂecting hydrogen-containing gases are
reduced with increasing the [H2]. The
∣∣VH2
∣∣ changes from 20.3 V at
[H2] = 49.1 ppm to 19.5 V at [H2] = 98.9 ppm, and to 18.4 and 18.1 V at
536 S.-Y. Chiu et al. / Sensors and Actuators B 141 (2009) 532–537
is due to more hydrogen molecules being dissociated into hydro-
gen atoms. Our previous work in [18,19] reported that Pd-deposited
GaN hydrogen sensors showed a response time shorter than that
of Pd-mixture-deposited GaN hydrogen sensors. By comparison,
the present Pd-mixture-Pd-deposited GaN hydrogen sensor has a
much longer response time at similar concentration of H2. The rel-
ative increase in the response time is likely limited by diffusion
rate of atomic hydrogen through the mixture. Another possible
origin is due to reduced adsorption efﬁciency because of the mix-
ture inserted between two Pd metals. Thus, further studies about
optimizing thickness and composition of the Pd–SiO2 mixture are
undergoing to improve the response time. Normally, e-gun evap-
oration used to deposit SiO2 is also another consideration for this
optimal composition.
Fig. 8 shows voltage transient responses of the proposed sensor
to the introduction and removal of various hydrogen-containing
gases with [H2] ranged from 49.1 to 10,100 ppm H2/N2. After sat-
uration in the sensing voltage, air/N2 gas is used to completely
remove the 10,100 ppm H2/N2 and the sensing voltage returns to its
baseline. Measurements have been repeatedly performed in ambi-
ences cycled from air/N2 to other hydrogen-containing gases and
then back to air/N2. At a constant Ibias = −5A, the sensor in N2
has the maximum magnitude of output voltage of VN2 ≈ 38 V. We
infer a conclusion that the current of the proposed sensor biased
at a high voltage is totally dominated by avalanche multiplication.
Besides, our sensor responds well to various hydrogen-containing
gases and produces transient voltages with repeatable curves. The
magnitudes of saturated voltages are decreased by introducing
higher [H2] gases, resulting in larger voltage variations. Similar
to the ta deﬁned in current transient response, the response time
(tb) in voltage transient response is deﬁned as the time that the

hydrogen sensor biased at a constant voltage (solid line) and a constant current

duction and removal of various hydrogen-containing gases.
voltage reaches from VN2 to Vb = (1 − e−1) × V + VN2 . We ﬁnd that
the measured tb in voltage transient curves also depends on the
hydrogen concentration. At 1080 ppm H2/N2, the tb is 380 s. When
the hydrogen concentration is increased to 10,100 ppm, the tb is
reduced to 60 s. The tb as a function of hydrogen concentration at
Ibias = −1A is also included in Fig. 7(a). Comparison between tb
and ta listed in table gives a new ﬁnding that the response times in
transient voltage curves is greatly shorter than those in transient
current curves. The reduction in response time is more substantial
at a lower hydrogen concentration. This implies that the proposed
sensor biased by a constant current is suitable for sensing a low
hydrogen concentration when considering the demand of a short
response time. Fig. 7(b) illustrates such reduction in response time
by relating sensing process of the proposed sensor biased with
a voltage and current in a hydrogen-containing ambience and in
N2. When the sensor is subjected to a [H2] ambience, the current-
voltage characteristic stabilizes at bottom curve after a period of
time. The proposed sensor biased with a voltage (current) is ﬁnally
operated at point A (B). The ta is required for the sensor’s current
density to increase from JN2 to Ja. At the same time, the sensor’s volt-
age changes from VN2 to Va that is larger than Vb. In other words,
the tb required for the sensor’s voltage to change from VN2 to Vb
is shorter than ta. Fig. 7(b) is employed to well explain the new
ﬁnding.

The lower lines represent the sensors in N2. An eﬀective
barrier height (EBH) in N2 is calculated to be higher than
880mV for both sensors. The sensing current densities of
both sensors are substantially enhanced with increasing
hydrogen concentrations. However, quite diﬀerent voltage-
related sensing currents are found between in Fig. 2(a) and
in Fig. 2(b). We ﬁrst refer to the sensor with the mixture as-
deposited and ﬁnd that eﬀects of applied voltages of 2:5 to
+2.5V on the sensing current density are not substantial. In
fact, increasing rates of current densities in N2 and in H2/N2
are nearly equal at voltages of 2:5 to +2.5V. At this
moment, no additional dipoles are formed except for the
dipoles at the mixture-GaN interface. However, the sensing
current density in H2/N2 is substantially increased at
voltages larger than 2.5V or smaller than 2:5V. The
increasing rate of the current density in H2/N2 is obviously
higher than that in N2. The current density in H2/N2 at 5V
is even more than two orders magnitude of that at 2V.
Chiu et al. previously proposed that hydrogen atoms can
possibly be adsorbed at the mixture-GaN interface and
inside the mixture. Hydrogen atoms inside the mixture have
not contributed to the increase in current density until the
internal electric ﬁeld is high enough. Kink behaviors are
observed at voltage magnitude of 2.5V on condition that
hydrogen atoms inside the mixture are polarized. If this is
the case, the voltage-dependent characteristics (i.e., kink)
should disappear when SiO2 inside the mixture is removed.
This is because hydrogen atoms are no longer trapped and
polarized inside the mixture. Furthermore, the current
densities in H2/N2 at voltages of 2:5 to +2.5V is expected
to be enhanced because (1) hydrogen atoms originally
trapped can be able to arrive at the interlayer to form dipoles
and (2) a larger surface-to-volume ratio is obtained due to
the removal of SiO2 covered over the Pd. As a result,
Fig. 2(b) really shows normal sensing properties as men-
tioned.
Figure 3 shows EBH variations () and sensing
responses (S) as a function of applied voltage for both
sensors.11) Here the S is deﬁned as the ratio of the current
diﬀerence between in H2/N2 (IH2) and in N2 (IN2) to that in
N2. That is S ¼ ðIH2  IN2Þ=IN2. Refer ﬁrst to the measured
results on the left-hand side of Fig. 3 for the sensor with the
mixture as-deposited. The  remains unchanged at voltage
magnitude smaller than 2.5V. Such a voltage-independent
 is increased from 225 to 280mV as the hydrogen
concentration is increased from 49.1 to 10100 ppm. Note
that the  is not voltage independent anymore at the
voltage magnitude larger than 2.5V. The S () at 4:5V
is 4 106 (385mV) while that at 2:0V is 6 104
(275mV) at 10,100 ppm H2/N2. Extremely high sensing
responses can also be obtained from the sensor with the
mixture wet-etched. Be worthy to note that the S () at
4:5V is 8 106 (405mV) while that at 2:0V is still as
large as 4 106 (385mV) for the sensor with the Pd-mixture
wet-etched at 10100 ppm H2/N2. The hydrogen atoms can
quickly diﬀuse through the Pd nanoparticles and locate at
the interlayer, instead of being adsorbed inside the mixture.
Thus almost all dipoles are formed close to the interfacial
layer once the voltage is applied to the sensor in H2/N2. This
also implies that the sensor with the mixture wet-etched
requires only a small voltage to obtain a compatible sensing
current (or S or ) as the sensing signal. So low power
consumption is expected. We contribute these improved
sensing properties to (1) the Pd nanoparticles, which are
responsible for highly eﬃcient dissociation and (2) the thin
supporting interlayer between Pd-nanoparticles and GaN,
which exhibits good hydrogen storage capability. Moreover,
the stable S over 105 ( over 275mV) is available even if
the sensor with Pd-mixture wet etched is at 2.13 ppm H2/N2.
The inset in Fig. 4 shows dynamic sensing current
densities of the sensor with the mixture wet-etched reﬂecting
the introduction and removal of hydrogen-containing gases
in wide range of 10100 to 49.1 ppm at 5V. The measured
current density starts to increase as soon as a 10100 ppm
H2/N2 gas is introduced. After ﬁnal saturation in the current
density (JH2,sat), air gas is used to completely remove the
10100 ppm H2/N2 gas and the sensing current density
returns to its baseline. Measurements have been repeatedly
performed in ambiences cycled from air to various
hydrogen-containing gases. The sensor responds well to
various hydrogen-containing gases and the responses show

Abstract: Pd-based mixtures comprising silicon dioxide (SiO2) were used as sensing materials in 
fabrication of GaN-based hydrogen sensors. The mixture as-deposited has a rough surface with 
many pores. After wet selectively etching to remove SiO2, the mixture turns into Pd nanoparticles 
with a size of similar to 30 nm on an interlayer with oxygen, as indicated by SEM, EDX, and SIMS 
methods. A careful study of the Pd-mixture on a metal-semiconductor-metal type of hydrogen 
sensor provides significant information on the roles of oxygen and the interlayer. Experimental 
results reveal that hydrogen atoms trapped inside the mixture as-deposited cannot contribute to 
changes in barrier height as an applied voltage is not large enough. Improved sensing properties 
such as hydrogen dissociation rate, diffusion rate, and storage capability were obtained when Pd 
nanoparticles were formed by selectively etching the mixture. The situation that hydrogen atoms 
were blocked and disturbed by oxygen will exist no more. Uniform sensing responses of higher 
than 105 (defined as (J(H2)-J(N2))/J(N2), J(H2) and J(N2) are current densities measured in H-2/N-2 
and N-2 ambiences, respectively), voltage shifts of larger than 20 V were obtained at 2.13 ppm 
H-2/N-2. In addition, hydrogen transport through grain boundaries of Pd nanoparticles is much 
faster than diffusion through a Pd-mixture layer. A much shorter response time was obtained from 
the sensors with the Pd-mixture wet etched. Furthermore, stable and reliable sensing 
characteristics were also expected. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

on (100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrates by a
metal–organic chemical vapor deposition system. It consisted
of a 0.6-μm n+-GaAs (n+ = 5× 1018 cm−3) subcollector
layer, a 0.8-μm n−-GaAs collector (n− = 8× 1016 cm−3),
a 0.08-μm p+-GaAs base layer (p+ = 4× 1019 cm−3), a
0.03-μm n-InGaP emitter layer (n = 3× 1017 cm−3), a 0.2-μm
n+-GaAs (n+ = 3× 1018 cm−3) subemitter layer, and, finally,
a 0.1-μm n+-InxGa1−xAs cap layer (x = 0−0.7 in 0.05 μm and
x = 0.7 in 0.05 μm). The device fabrication started with emitter
and base mesas. Emitter, collector, and base ohmic contacts
were performed by depositing AuGeNi and AuZn upon the cap,
subcollector, and base layers, respectively. The base–emitter
and base–collector junction areas are 2.56× 10−4 and 1.76×
10−3 cm2, respectively. Two Schottky electrodes with multiple
fingers were formed by depositing a 30-nm mixture of Pd and
SiO2 upon the exposed collector layer [15], [16]. The effective
sensing area is 8× 10−4 cm2. Hydrogen detection was carried
out at room temperature using hydrogen-containing gases in
the range of 49.1–10100-ppm H2 in N2. Fig. 1(b) shows the
equivalent circuit used to evaluate the static performance of
the Schottky-type hydrogen sensor and the Gummel plots of
the HBT. Fig. 1(c) is used to evaluate the static common-emitter
and Gummel-plot sensing characteristics and dynamic sensing
responses of the integrated hydrogen-sensing amplifier.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fig. 2(a) shows sensing diode currents as functions of
voltage (VBB′) for the GaAs Schottky-type hydrogen sensor.
Current–voltage (I–V ) characteristics indicate bidirectional de-
tection with nearly symmetrical curves. The lowest line repre-
sents the sensing diode current (IDN) of the sensor operated
in N2. On the other hand, sensing diode currents (IDH’s) are
enhanced with the introduction of hydrogen-containing gases.
The measured sensing diode currents are 4.25× 10−10, 7.10×
10−8, 9.09× 10−8, and 1.04× 10−7 A at VBB′ = −0.5 V in
N2 and in 1080-, 4890-, and 10 100-ppm H2/N2 ambiences, re-
spectively. The calculated sensing-diode-current gains (GD =
IDH/IDN) are 167, 214, and 247 corresponding to barrier-
height variations of 133, 139, and 143 mV. Even if the GaAs
Schottky-type hydrogen sensor is at 49.1-ppm H2/N2, a GD

acteristics and calculated sensing-base- and collector-current gains for the
integrated hydrogen-sensing amplifier.
of ∼93 is still obtained. Furthermore, other sensing regions are
also found at the magnitude of VBB′ that is larger than 2.5 V.
Previous works in [15] and [16] explained that such sensing
regions are likely attributed to the 3-D dipoles formed inside the
mixture. By comparison, a pure Pd-deposited GaAs Schottky-
type hydrogen sensor fabricated with the same structure shows
a GD of only two to three and no such sensing regions. How-
ever, the 3-D dipoles do not contribute to further improvement
in GD within these sensing regions. This is likely limited and
compensated by an additional leakage current. Fig. 2(b) shows
the Gummel-plot curves of the InGaP–GaAs HBT, indicating a
common-emitter current gain (βo) up to ∼75.
Fig. 3(a) shows the common-emitter sensing characteristics
of the integrated hydrogen-sensing amplifier represented by
Fig. 1(c). The operated condition is VBE = 3.0 V with max-
imum power consumption of 0.25 mW. Instead of the base
current, N2 and various hydrogen-containing gases are used
as input signals, and sensing collector currents (ICN and ICH)
are employed as output signals. Experimental results reveal
that ICN and ICH reflect well to the input signals. The bottom
line represents the ICN of the hydrogen-sensing amplifier in
standby mode, indicating power consumption that is smaller
than 0.4 μW. When a hydrogen-containing gas is introduced to
the integrated hydrogen-sensing amplifier, the dipole-induced
current (IBH) is operated as the base current that is amplified by
the HBT to ICH. Of course, the IBN in N2 can also be amplified
to ICN. However, βo that is base-current dependent determines
the final ICN and ICH. In fact, βo at IBH is larger than that at
IBN. Thus, relative high static sensing responses are expected.
In order to address the opinion and optimize the operating
point, Gummel-plot curves were measured to calculate sensing-
base-current gains (GB = IBH/IBN) and sensing-collector-
current gains (GC = ICH/ICN). As shown in Fig. 3(b), GB
has the highest value at VBE ≈ 1.5 V and then decreases with
increasing VBE. With regard to the output signals, GC starts to
decrease after the maximum value at VBE ≈ 1.9 V. We explain
the GB-versus-VBE and GC-versus-VBE behaviors according to
Fig. 2. Note that VBE is equal to the sum of VBB′ and VB′E. The

英文發明摘要： 
A high-performance semiconductor hydrogen sensor with nano-scale catalytic metal layer is 
disclosed by the present invention. The nano-scale catalytic metal layer with holes is formed as: i) 
the metal-oxide mixture is formed upon the semiconductor sensing platform, and ii) the etching 
process is employed to remove the oxide of the metal-oxide mixture. The large surface area of the 
nano-scale catalytic metal layer with holes could effectively increase the adsorbed and decomposed 
effect of hydrogen atoms. Also, hydrogen atoms trapped within the mixture below the catalytic 
metal layer could form the three-dimensional dipoles as function of the biased voltages. The 
sensitivity is relatively large and the response time is relatively short, which indicate the 
semiconductor hydrogen sensor is very promising for low-concentration hydrogen detection.

Conference)於 5月 1日至 6日在加拿大蒙特婁市之會展中心 5樓會議廳舉辦。該項國際會議分
春秋兩季，舉辦國遍及全球，而且會議長久以來所探討之主題內容眾多，但都是和當前尖端科
技息息相關者，例如有綠色能源、有機化學、關鍵性介電材料、光電半導體、奈米科技、感測
光電、記憶體等等非常廣泛。當然本屆所攮括主題亦不例外，涉及之主題近 40項，超過千篇
技術論文發表，當然與會之學者專家人數，參展之高科技廠商數目等自是相當的多。除了拜積
體電路高積極度日益增進，元件尺寸、製作不斷微縮所帶來的製程設備與表面電化性關鍵技術
外，能源需求亦促使相關產業不斷合作研發。另外、經過國內學、產界各教授專家近期來對該
會議的積極投入會議核心，從而廣受邀請擔任 Session Chair或 Invited Speaker，使得每年參與
本項會議之國內學者專家也越來越多，最後也證明大家的努力與成果終獲得肯定而發揮了進一
步之影響力。 
筆者因為國內直飛班機時程，而遲至 5月 2日才於桃園國際機場搭乘長榮航空班機直飛加拿大
而仍於 5月 2日抵達多倫多市，期間一同隨機同行參與此次國際會議的，尚有同系所譚仕煒教
授、筆者碩士班學生楊偉臣、韋志縈。筆者與一行人順利入境後，隨即驅車前往蒙特婁市，下
榻 138公路上旅店，距離邁基爾大學，蒙特婁大學校區之一均僅不到 10分鐘走路路程。依序
完成報到程序並拾取各項與會資料後，隨即按照先前預定與安排的程序參與議程，筆者團隊之
於 138公路旁的邁基爾大學，蒙特婁大學校區，乃至邁基爾大學醫學中心及隔壁美式足球場。
由於筆者返國之班機在多倫多當地 8日母親節凌晨，所以一行人也驅車前往市區南郊之尼加拉
瀑布，造訪位於多倫多中國城正北方之多倫多大學，但因時值假日，也未有熟識之友人，故而
僅約略地在校區隨處逛逛而已並不值一提。 
 
三、建議： 
    有關氮化物系列材料研發、藍光元件之技術開發一直以來也為國家積極推展之重點科技，事
實上學產界亦投下相當大的資金於此一領域，近一、二年在光電元件、特別是 LED顯然已有
理想成果。但是亦應積極著重於氮化物之其他應用，如高功率元件發展以免處處落居他國技術。
另則能源、環保相關之技術與議題，也是科技進步與落後之象徵。我國有幸一直處於世界電子
科技之先端，當思及如何在保有設計、製造之優勢下，再突破製程設備之依賴性，急需藉由政
府相關單位推動發展之。

Metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) types of hydrogen sensors 
with a Pd-SiO2 mixture as-deposited and wet-etched were 
evaluated by SEM, EDX, and SIMS. The results show that Pd 
nanoparticles and an interfacial layer with oxygen were formed, 
which contribute to improved dissociation rate, diffusion rate, and 
storage capability. In additional to responding well to various 
hydrogen-containing gases, the sensor with the mixture wet-etched 
produces a barrier-height variation over 275 mV at 2.13 ppm 
H2/N2.  
 
 
Introduction 
 
Semiconductor-type hydrogen sensors have recently received considerable interest in the 
applications involving detection of leaks in a variety of space and ground based vehicles 
and processing systems. Hydrogen is reported to be able to alter the effective charge at 
the metal-semiconductor interface or metal-insulator interface, resulting in changes in 
barrier height. Wide-gap metal-semiconductor diodes such as Pd-GaN and Pt-GaN 
structures employing such an effect have been evidenced to be hydrogen sensors used at 
high temperatures and in harsh environments (1, 2). Eventually, the permeability and 
hydrogen storage capability of catalytic metals may influence the reaction rates. Their 
sensing ability also depends on the properties of the hydrogen adsorption states at the 
interface. Therefore silicon dioxide (SiO2) used as a supporting layer is usually employed 
to improve interfacial properties (3). On the other hand, porous-like sensing metals are 
used when considering an increased surface-to-volume ratio and an enhanced dissociation 
rate (4). So far, most reports addressed that the hydrogen atoms were trapped at 
interfacial plane where a two-dimensional polarized layer is formed. Although three-
dimensional dipoles were proposed by Chiu et al. (5), no direct evidence was provided. In 
this study, a Pd-SiO2 mixture as a pre-sensing source was deposited upon the GaN layer. 
A metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) type of hydrogen sensors was then fabricated with 
the mixture as-deposited and wet-etched. The advantages found in the SiO2 supporting 
layer and a porous-like sensing metal are also observed in our mixture electrodes. 
Furthermore, sensing properties of the MSM hydrogen sensors with the mixture as-
deposited and wet-etched were compared to provide information on the roles of oxygen 
inside the mixture and/or the interfacial layer.

Results and Discussion 
 
Figure 3 shows static sensing current densities of the sensors with the mixture as-
deposited and wet-etched. The lower lines represent the sensors in a N2 ambience. An 
effective barrier height (EBH) in N2 is calculated to be higher than 880 mV for both 
sensors. The sensing current densities of both sensors are enhanced with increasing 
hydrogen concentrations. However, quite different voltage dependences of the sensing 
currents are found in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). We first find that effects of applied voltages in 
the range from −2.5 to +2.5 V on the sensing current density are not substantial for the 
sensor with the mixture as-deposited. The increasing rates of current densities in N2 and

H2/N2. The hydrogen atoms can quickly diffuse through the Pd nanoparticles and locate 
at the interlayer, instead of being adsorbed inside the mixture. Thus almost all dipoles are 
formed close to the interfacial layer once the voltage is applied to the sensor in H2/N2. 
We contribute these improved sensing properties to (i) the Pd nanoparticles, which are 
responsible for highly efficient dissociation and (ii) the thin supporting interlayer 
between Pd-nanoparticles and GaN, which exhibits good hydrogen storage capability. 
Moreover, the stable S over 105 (Δφ over 275 mV) is available even if the sensor with the 
mixture wet-etched is at 2.13 ppm H2/N2.  
 
The inset in Fig. 5 shows dynamic sensing current densities of the sensor with the 
mixture wet-etched reflecting the introduction and removal of hydrogen-containing gases 
in wide range of 10100 to 49.1 ppm. The measured current density starts to increase as 
soon as  a 10100 ppm H2/N2 gas is introduced. After final saturation in the current density 
(JH2,sat), air gas is used to completely remove the 10100 ppm H2/N2 gas and the sensing 
current density  returns to its baseline. Measurements have been repeatedly performed in 
ambiences cycled from air to various hydrogen-containing gases. The sensor responds 
well to various hydrogen-containing gases With regard to response times the sensor with 
the mixture wet-etched has a quicker sensor reaction at the same hydrogen concentration. 
This is expected since hydrogen atoms are no longer blocked and/or disturbed when they 
diffuse through the Pd nanoparticles with wider pores. The response time is reduced from 
~1010 to ~90 s (~3330 to ~320 s) when the hydrogen concentration is increased from 
49.1 to 10100 ppm H2/N2 for the sensor with the mixture wet-etched (as-deposited). 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
In summary, experimental studies on hydrogen sensors conclude that the mixture formed 
by co-evaporating Pd and SiO2 is an appropriate material for sensing hydrogen. A lot of 
2012年第 14屆國際化學性感測器研討會 
 
(IMCS 2012-The 14th International Meeting on Chemical Sensors) 
 
報告撰寫人：羅文雄 
國立台灣海洋大學電機系教授 
 
一、參加會議經過： 
 
(一) IMCS: 
2012 年第 14 屆化學性感測器國際研討會(The 14th International Meeting on 
Chemical Sensors)於 5月 20日至 23日在德國紐倫堡之會展中心舉辦。該項國際會
議之首屆 1983年於日本的 Fukuoka市舉辦，最近一屆則是 2010年澳大利亞的 Perth
市，由於參與人數、發表論文與範疇等急速增加、近幾屆以來演然成為全球涉獵
最大最廣的氣體感測技術領域國際型會議。會議名稱雖以化學(chemical)感測為名，
實際上卻包括了物理(physics)、化性(chemistry)、材料科學 (materials science) 以及
含生醫工程(biomedical engineering)的工程(engineering)領域。參加的與會學者專家
當然來自世界各科技先進國家，委員會除特定的指導委員會外，更因應區域所需
設立有亞太區、歐非區、北南美區議程委員會，足見與會者的廣汎與深度。本屆
更特別是的，其又結合了全球最大的感測器博覽會(SENSOR+TEST)，所有與會
IMCS者均可免費分享該博覽會展示之成果， 由於 IMCS比較偏向學術研究性質，
會展中心前廣場與大門。IMCS係在Messe之 NCC廳西區的平面層(level 0)和一樓
層(level 1)舉行，同廳東區則是 SENSOR+TEST的展示場，因此相當方便雙方參與
者作時間之調整和運用。完成報到程序並拾取各項與會資料後(攜回資料後記)，隨
即按照出發前預定與安排的程序參與議程，筆者壁報論文之發表於 5月 22日下午
3:30展開，並於期間報告個人在氫氣感測器之技術開發成果(詳見發表論文)。會議
期間筆者當然也利用空檔參與多項氣體感測和生醫感測的節次，交換彼此研究心
得，獲益良多。回程則依然搭乘中華航空班機返抵國門，結束整整一週的旅途。 
 
(三) 與會內容 
       具體的議程其實是從 5月 21日早上的歡迎會(welcome session)開始，接著是由
日本氣體警示工業協會主席 Tesshi Shigemori 所主講的 plenary talk，題目為”Gas 
Sensor Status and Future Trends for Safety Application” (註：本次議程另兩 plenary 
talks分別為 Prof. Krishna Persaud (Univ. Manchester, UK)之”Reverse Engineering of 
Nature in the Field of Chemical Sensors”和 Prof. Harry Tuller (MIT, US)之”Materials for 
High Temperature Electrochemical Applications”)，再來就是包括口頭、壁報論文發
表的主角出場。至於口頭論文發表部份，大會將每節分為五大會場，一樓層的會
場更特別的是以地名如 Brussel、Munchen 1、Munchen 2 、Mailand 及 Athen等來
稱呼，而壁報論文的發表則在平面樓層餐廳與巴臺旁。本次論文的研究主題雖然
相當廣泛，若仔細分類與比較，仍以氣體和生醫感測為大宗，再以學門領域來分，
又係以節能減碳的綠能感測，環境安全的環保科技、以及身心照護的生技為焦點。 
適於舉辦各項展覽與會議之會展中心外，另一原因主要是有一座古老城市位在中
央車站前，並為古城牆所圍繞而成者，城中有三座建築典雅的古老教堂(聖羅倫茨
教堂、聖母教堂及聖澤巴爾教堂)、凱薩堡為最有參觀價值，棋盤式街道兩旁則鄰
列著各種不同品味的商店、餐廳與百貨公司，是大會所極力推薦參訪的景點之一。
筆者幸運地下榻在離此不遠的 A&O旅社，所以和學生在會後傍晚(當地 9點過後
才天黑)也造訪了古城中位於國王街底的凱薩堡，從堡上俯瞰古城，不禁感慨與佩
服德國人對歷史的尊重和史績的維護、的確值得我輩學習。除紐倫堡外，筆者也
抽空造訪了德國所創立的第 1 所大學：海德堡大學，但因為只是因為班機空餘時
間的私人參觀遊覽，並沒有任何熟識之友人等，故而僅私自參觀該校的圖書館設
施與規劃、搭乘纜車遊覽半山腰的城堡外，未有特別意義而不值得進一步詳細說
明。 
 
四、建議： 
      學、產界對舉辦國內、國際性大型研討會、計畫成果發表等並不陌生，進幾年
來在產官學合力推動下更爭取了許多國際型重量級會議。但就針對學術研討會或
計畫成果發表會來說，主要型態為廣邀相關領域的學者專家作面對面的技術交流，
讓技術說明及理論驗證不受空間上的限制而得以實質交流。此外配合產界互動也
通常開闢有業界展示區，希望藉此廠商可快速地把最先進有用產品介紹給學界，
讓學產雙方互蒙其利。此次參與 IMCS研討會和 SENSOR+TEST博覽會後，閃過
一絲概念：如何把研討會或發表會的成果實質上運用在商品化或類似者，應該是
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NCC廳平面樓層壁報論文討論區 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
左圖為口頭論文發表會場，其位於一樓層，從右圖中樓梯即可抵達 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
左圖為從凱薩堡俯瞰紐倫堡古城區，右圖則係城中聖羅倫茨教堂 
 
 
而 SENSOR+TEST則著重在商業實用價值，因此大會特別安排兩者之技術交流，
希望學術研究之焦點能更貼近實務應用層面。 
 
(二) 與會過程 
筆者因為搭乘國內直飛班機，所以選擇 5月 18日晚間於桃園國際機場直飛德國
的中華航空班機，並在 5月 19日一早便抵達法蘭克福機場，期間一同隨機同行參
與此次國際會議的尚有筆者所指導的碩士班學生韋志縈(海大補助部份經費)。由於
會期在 20日午後才展開，所以順利入境後係直接先前往所要下榻之法蘭克福市中
央車站旁的 Savoy 旅社，但赫然發現整個市區除了一群和筆者們一樣茫然的外來
客外，就是排排站的警察或不斷移動的警車，地鐵(U-line)、捷運火車(S-line)和電
連車(H-line)均都停擺，路上完全沒有私人交通工具，經詢問當地駐守警察才知道
歐盟央行、德國央行正位於中央火車站和 Zeil 街之間，當日當地市民等則呼應華
爾街茉莉花活動而進行大規模的示威抗議遊行，筆者無奈只得繞過金融區沿梅因
河步行到羅馬廣場稍作參觀活動，所幸該示威活動圓滿結束，筆者等人得以安然
搭乘德國火車(DB train)前往紐倫堡市。 
從法蘭克福市搭乘 DB ICE火車到紐倫堡市約需 2個小時 10分鐘，下榻由大會
所推薦的 A&O旅社，該旅社雖然非常簡略，但在德國算是十分平價者且其距離中
央車站和紐倫堡古城區僅僅約 100 公尺而已，所以相當方便。簡單完成 check-in
和整理後，筆者隨即在中央車站搭乘 U1(或 U11)地鐵前往會場，期間要跨區通過 6
個車站，僅約需 10分鐘左右便可到達會展中心(Messe)站，通過天橋便可直接來到
 二、與會心得： 
      筆者係首次參與全球最大且純屬感測技術領域的國際研討會，這當然和筆者係
氣體感測研究領域的 3 年級生有關，但是相對地在本次與與會中也吸取更多技術
經驗，尤其是目前、未來感測材料、機制、應用等之趨勢，讓筆者在研究課題遭
遇瓶頸時，又有新的領會。緊接著把此次與會心得擇要並取重點說明如次。首先，
綜觀 plenary talks所揭和當前感測技術趨勢大體都隨著全球能源概念發展再生綠能
之監控、遵循尖端科技製造所需安全措施追求環安，因應人類身心照護而發展的
生醫晶片，國內其實一直都有朝向生醫發展的推動，值得肯定。第二、在感測的
推動下，感測訊號的擷取顯為大眾熟知，但在無線技術趨勢下，如何將訊號結合
無線傳輸達到無遠彿屆則是目前所應積極推動者。顯然當涉及無線傳輸時，如何
達成與提供無線氛圍又是所需面對的課題。拿筆者此次搭乘 DB ICE(Intercity 
Express)火車經驗舉例，德國幅員廣大，搭乘國鐵少則數小時，多則近十小時，但
列車上除如航空班機上提供有電源插座、e化娛樂消遣活動外，也提供有無線上網
功能，使從業人員得以善加利用時間。國內目前尚未見有此類服務與功能，但筆
者卻認為有發展在大眾傳輸交通工具的價值，政府並應儘早制定與規劃出標準規
範，繼之，各項感測、無線傳輸方得以全面配合研究發展，讓我國即早或迎上綠
能、環保、健康照護的氛圍。 
 
三、參觀訪問 
紐倫堡市為巴伐利亞省第二大城，每年都吸引許多觀光客到此，除了因為有
研討會或發表會除學術交流外，實務交流也應獲得響應。方法之一、例如是邀請
相關技術領域的業界、廠商及公司中研發單位，以壁報方式提出各自需求、所欲
解決技術瓶頸、零組件功能規格等類似者，同樣進行面對面的溝通、交流，希望
研討會或發表會的成果便直接可實質上運用或解決業界問題，又或建立合作管道
作為研究課題、計畫主題等，此種模式並不同於以往的廠商產品展示與輸出給學
界，反而是希望從學界輸入成果或技術。筆者知道微電子學門目前就存在有學門
網站提供此一平台，但終究仍處於被動模式，又或受限於空間，不如面對面的溝
通交流來得直接有效。

Abstract: 
Thermodynamic sensing properties of GaAs-based hydrogen sensors with a mixture of Pd and SiO2 
were investigated by raising ambient temperature. Temperature dependence of the ability of SiO2 to 
catch hydrogen atoms was addressed to introduce a newly possible sensing mechanism for innovative 
sensor design. A high sensing current gain over 3000, a detection limit lower than 50 ppm, and a 
response time shorter than 20 s were obtained from the sensor. 
Key words: GaAs, hydrogen sensor, metal-semiconductor-metal, response time, sensing mechanism, 
and thermodynamic. 
Introduction 
After the report on detection of hydrogen in [1], 
many studies were focused on sensing 
mechanism of various MOS structures. 
Commonly accepted sensing sequences were 
explained as: hydrogen molecules are 
dissociated at the catalytic metal surface 
followed by rapid diffusion of atomic hydrogen 
to the metal-oxide interface where dipoles are 
formed. Then metal-semiconductor (MS) diodes 
being sensitive to hydrogen were also 
explained by the similar sensing mechanism. 
The hydrogen atoms have been absorbed and 
hence the dipoles have been formed at the 
interface until [2] was raised by Chiu et al. 
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is intentionally mixed into 
a Pd metal to provide adsorption sites not only 
at the interface but also inside the bulk mixture 
in their work. However, no further investigation 
concerning those hydrogen atoms caught by 
the SiO2 is reported. Thermodynamic studies on 
ability of the SiO2 to catch the hydrogen are 
presented in this study. 
Experimental 
GaAs-based chemical hydrogen sensors with a 
suggested mixture of Pd and SiO 2 were 
fabricated on the same substrate design 
described in [3]. As shown in Fig. 1, a metal-
semiconductor-metal type of hydrogen sensor 
has two Schottky electrodes with multiple 
fingers formed by depositing a 30 nm mixture.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. A MSM type of hydrogen sensor fabricated 
with two multiple-finger Schottky electrodes. 
The thickness was monitored in situ with a 
quartz crystal head. Both of the finger width and 
finger-to-finger spacing were 5 m. The total 
effective area of each Schottky electrode for 
sensing hydrogen was 810
-4
 cm
2
. A custom-
made 235-ml flow-through test chamber made 
from stainless steel was used. The ambient 
temperature and relative humidity were well 
controlled at 252
o
C and 382%. Various 
hydrogen-containing gases with specific 
concentration of 0.01, 0.1, and 1% H2/N2 were 
employed. The nitrogen as carrier is used to 
avoid unnecessary effect of oxygen in air on the 
hydrogen atoms caught by SiO2. Temperature 
modulation in the sensing device was achieved 
by well-controlled stage from 25 to 110
 o
C. 
  
 
Fig. 5. Dynamic response of the sensor at various 
temperatures. Inset lists current gains and response 
times. 
 
introducing 0.1% H2/N2, air, 0.01% H2/N2, and 
air to the sensor at 25
o
C. Similar measurements 
have also been repeatedly performed by 
alternately introducing hydrogen-containing 
gases and air as described above at 
temperature of 50, 80 and 110
o
C, respectively. 
The MSM sensor responds well to various 
hydrogen containing gases at various 
temperatures and produces transient currents 
with repeatable curves.  
One of key merits used evaluate a gas sensor 
is the response time (ta) defined as the time 
needed for I to reach (1-e
-1
) total change in 
current. Inset in Fig. 5 lists current gains and 
response times. As the hydrogen concentration 
is increased from 0.01% to 1%, the ta is 
decreased from 485 to 60s at 25
o
C. Similarly, 
the ta is decreased from 60 to 20s by raising 
temperature from 25 to 110
o
C. Again, we 
contribute a shorter response time to both a 
higher dissociation rate and more energized 
hydrogen atoms at higher temperature. 
 
Summary 
Thermodynamic studies of GaAs-based 
chemical sensors with a mixture of Pd and SiO2 
will be presented to include static and dynamic 
responses and to introduce a newly possible 
sensing mechanism for innovative structured 
sensors.
