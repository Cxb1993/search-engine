I.  INTRODUCTION 
Many commercial sonar systems have been designed to detect and track 
divers/swimmers in harbors and coastal areas to prevent terrorist attacks.1 Since 
underwater intruders are acoustically quiet, detection often relies on target echoes 
from active sonar operated at high frequencies (tens of kHz). The sonar returns are 
normally displayed in range and bearing referred to as the echograph.  It is found that 
the echograph (using Doppler insensitive waveforms) is full of high level scattered 
returns, some of them form “tracks” and can be confused with targets.2 Discrete high 
level returns that are not target-related are referred to as clutter. Clutter reduction 
requires novel system solutions, signal-processing techniques1,2 and better 
understanding of the clutter statistics.   For example, advanced tracking techniques 
based on track kinematics have been widely used to analyze clutter data to detect 
moving targets.  See, for example Ref. 3 and 4, and references therein. We find, to our 
knowledge, little analyses on the acoustic properties of the signal and reverberation in 
the harbor environments, nor any capabilities to model/predict their levels and 
statistical properties. In general, active sonar can encounter high level reverberation 
returns from man-made structures, debris, uneven bottom depth, fish school, etc. in 
harbor environments.  As sonar resolution improves, scattered returns from discrete 
objects are more pronounced and can be confused with targets.  In this paper, we 
investigate the use of Doppler sonar to discriminate target from reverberation. 
Most sonar use linear frequency modulated (LFM) or hyperbolic frequency 
modulated (HFM) pulses for range estimation. The HFM pulse is used for its Doppler 
insensitivity, allowing all Doppler targets to be processed with only one replica. 
Doppler-sensitive waveforms, such as pulsed sinusoidal waves, have also been used 
in low frequency active sonar, often in combination with other waveforms, such as 
HFM. Other Doppler-sensitive waveforms include binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) 
and Costas signals. For a moving source, the Doppler of the reverberation are bearing 
(beam angle) dependent. Doisy et al. explored the bearing-dependent Doppler to 
discriminate/suppress reverberation from different look directions using pulsed 
sinusoidal waves and pulsed trains of frequency-modulated signals.5,6  Jourdain et al. 
used BPSK signals to study echo returns from target highlights moving along a 
rectilinear trajectory.7,8 The knowledge of the delay-Doppler values for different 
points allows estimation of target dimensions and longitudinal speed.7 The phase 
differences of the peaks of the cross-ambiguity surfaces between two sensors can be 
 
 
5 
the target spectral peaks.  In a Dopplergram, the presence of a “line” in the high 
Doppler space (say, with > 0.5 knot radial speed) is an “unambiguous” indication 
of a speedy target. 
Similarly, a strong peak in the high Doppler space in individual wideband 
ambiguity surfaces is a clear indication of a speedy target, even with a few 
snapshots of data.  
The paper is organized as follows.  The Doppler property of a BPSK signal coded 
with a maximum-length sequence (m-sequence) is reviewed in Sec. II to compare 
with other popular waveforms.  Target echo is identified by delay and Doppler. The 
active experiment is described in Sec. III, followed by data analysis.  The 
reverberation amplitude statistics is studied in Sec. IV. One-way TL measurement and 
modeling are presented in Sec. V to assess the echo strength as a function of range.  
System implications are discussed in Sec. VI.  A summary is given in Sec. VII. 
II.  DOPPLER ANALYSIS: THE WIDEBAND AMBIGUITY FUNCTION  
The purpose of active radar/sonar systems is not only to detect the echo buried 
in the noise/reverberation but also to estimate the range and velocity of the target, and 
distinguish the target echo from clutter to avoid false alarms. So the signals to be used 
must not only provide a sufficient processing gain to combat the noise but also exhibit 
a good time and frequency resolution.  Under noise-limited detection conditions, 
detection performance can be improved by increasing the signal energy/duration, 
using, for example, pulsed continuous waves (CW). Under reverberation-limited 
conditions (where reverberation level also increases with signal energy/duration), 
performance is dependent on both signal duration (T) and bandwidth (B), requiring 
normally wideband signals. The basic tool for performance characterization is the 
wideband ambiguity function (WAF) originally used to analyze a given (transmitted) 
signal.10-12 Here, we use a generalized WAF, which has been widely used in the 
literature to analyze the received data,13 defined as 
 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )r x t r t dt x t r tα ατ α τ

−∞
Φ = − = − ⊗∫ , (1) 
where ⊗  denotes the convolution operator, r(t) denotes the received signal, and 
( ) ( )x t s tα α α=  is the time compressed or dilated version of the transmitted signal 
( )s t , where α   is the compression/dilation ratio, referred as the Doppler ratio, and  τ

equations. The pulsed CW signal is given by 0( ) ( )sin(2 )x t A t f tπ= , the LFM signal is 
given by 20
1( ) ( )sin[2 ( )]
2
x t A t f t ktπ= + , and the HFM signal is given by 
x(t) = A(t)sin[2π
β
log(1+ β f0t)]  where A(t) is the signal envelope,  f0 is the initial 
frequency, f0 = fc ± B / 2 , and
 
k, β are the frequency sweep rates.11 The BPSK signal 
is given by x(t) = A(t)sin{2π[ fct + b(t)]} , where b(t) is a binary sequence of codes, 
each of duration 1/B.  We assumed zero Doppler. 
The WAFs of the above signals are displayed in Fig. 1 in terms of a two-
dimensional surface as a function of the delay time and Doppler shift (of the center 
frequency), henceforth referred to as delay and Doppler in short.  The peak of the 
ambiguity surface (the width of the peak) reveals the resolution in delay and Doppler 
- the accuracy to which a target's range and radial speed can be estimated.  Since the 
volume under the wideband ambiguity function is close to the square of the signal 
energy, it is conventional to plot the ambiguity function surface normalized by the 
signal energy.  For the numerical examples, we use signal parameters corresponding 
to the experiment data analyzed in Sec. III.  The CW, LFM, HFM, and BPSK pulses 
have a center frequency  fc = 50 kHz, a duration T = 0.26 s and a bandwidth B = 
15,625 Hz except for the CW.  A rectangular window is used. Figure 1a shows that 
the ambiguity function for the pulsed CW. It has a high Doppler resolution, on the 
order of 1/T, but lacks range resolution as is well-known. The HFM signal has a high 
range resolution, on the order 1/B.  It is known to be insensitive to Doppler; as seen in 
Fig. 1b the peak values of the ambiguity surface stay nearly flat across Doppler 
(within ~ 3 dB).  The ambiguity surface for the LFM signal, shown in Fig. 1c, is 
similar to that of the HFM signal, except that its peak values at near zero delay-time 
drop by 16 dB from 0 to ±100 Hz.  It has a range resolution approximately the same 
as that of the HFM signal.  The Doppler sensitivity of a LFM signal generally 
decreases with its bandwidth.  As a result, low bandwidth LFM is often used for 
Doppler insensitive processing.

a strong object mask the echo return from a weak target causing the target to be 
undetected.  
Figure 2a shows the wideband ambiguity surface of the BPSK signal coded 
with an m-sequence of length 4095.15  It shows a high peak centered at zero delay and 
Doppler, with low sidelobe levels in both delay and Doppler.16  The peak-to-sidelobe 
ratio in delay is theoretically of the order 10log(4095) ~ 36 dB; the low sidelobe 
levels are due to the cyclic orthogonality of the m-sequence.  Figure 2b shows the 
color display (in dB) of the ambiguity surface where one zooms in on the peak.  It 
shows more clearly the delay and Doppler resolution.  Near the peak, the ambiguity 
function can be approximated by ( )sinc( )B Tτ πΛ Δ , where B and T are the signal 
bandwidth and duration as defined above,  Λ is the triangular function, and Δ denotes 
the Doppler shift.7,14 The triangular and sinc function dependence is observed in Fig. 
2b. There is no coupling between delay and Doppler.  The delay resolution measured 
at -3 dB point is ~ 0.04 ms, corresponding to a range resolution of ~ 0.03 m.  The 
Doppler resolution measured at -3 dB point is ~ 2.5 Hz. Such fine resolution is the 
result of the large bandwidth and long duration of the signal for the purpose of 
boosting the processing gain and suppressing the sidelobe levels.

1 The fine range resolution turns out to be a disadvantage in target search in real data using a 
color display as discussed below, since the sharp peak is only observable when one zooms in 
on the peak due to the limited number of pixels in the color display.  This is confirmed using 
simulated data, for which signal distortion by the propagation channel is not an issue. One

III.  ACTIVE EXPERIMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS 
An experiment was conducted in the Woods Hole Harbor in August 2009 to 
study the active returns using both Doppler insensitive and sensitive waveforms.17 A 
32" air-filled steel sphere with a weight at the bottom (supported by another 32" 
sphere at the surface) was towed approximately 10 m behind a ship, at a depth of 
estimated 3-6 m, to emulate a moving target. A directional source with a beam width 
of 6° and a directional receiver with a beam width of 16° were deployed at the pier at 
a depth of ~9 m pointing to the target as shown in Fig. 3. The source and receiver are 
spaced horizontally at a distance of ~ 13 m forming a “mono”-static active system. 
The Woods Hole Harbor has an average depth of 12 m along the tracks. At some 
spots, the water depth can be as shallow as 9 m, and as deep as 15 m.  
LFM pulses and the Doppler sensitive m-sequence signals centered at 50 
kHz were transmitted in sequence, and repeated (one after the other), so that they 
encounter the same propagation and reverberation conditions.  The signals were 
separated by a sufficient time (~1 s) to allow target detection (up to 750 m) and 
reverberation to recede to the noise level.  The LFM signal has a bandwidth of 10,000 
 
 
13 
referred to as volume reverberation in this paper.

FIGURE 4 Matched filtered output as a function of the delay time for each LFM ping, 
stacked over many pings.  Vertical axis denotes the ping transmission (Tx) time. 
Amplitude in arbitrary units but fixed between the different pings. 
 
Figure 5 shows the time series of eight pings evenly spaced in time, when 
target is close and has a high signal level.  One sees that the time series show many 
high level peaks, which one is the target is ambiguous. Because of the ambiguities, 
one cannot localize the target since the target range cannot be reliably estimated.  
Whether the target has a high speed (and poses immediate danger) cannot be 
determined based on (just) eight pings of data.  Hence, one must rely on target track 
analysis based on target kinematics, which can be done, in principle, with just a few 
pings but, in practice, requires likely many pings to reduce the uncertainty. Thus, we 
explore alternative means of target discrimination using Doppler as the discriminator 
as done in airborne radar. In airborne radar, detection is based mostly on direct path; 
ground clutter is known and well separated in time from the target.  Target return has 
 
 
15 
transmitted at Tx Time = 97.8 s as an example, the ambiguity surface in the 
neighborhood of the target echo is shown in Fig. 6a, and is used to illustrate the data 
processing leading to the Dopplergram and Doppler filtered time series (presented in 
subsections 1 and 2 below). Figure 6a shows a sharp peak with  > 25 dB peak to 
sidelobe ratio at a delay time of ~0.129 s and Doppler frequency of ~100 Hz, 
indicating the presence of a target moving with a radial speed of 3 knots, located at a 
range of ~97 m from the source/receive.  Plotting the ambiguity function at a fixed 
delay time of ~0.129 s (the delay time of the peak) as a function of the Doppler 
frequency, one obtains the target ambiguity function as a function of Doppler shift 
(referred to as the Doppler spectrum) as shown in Fig. 6b. It shows a Doppler 
resolution of ~3 Hz at -3 dB level, approximately the same as expected theoretically 
(see above).  Plotting the ambiguity function at a fixed Doppler shift of ~100 Hz (the 
Doppler shift of the peak) as a function of the delay time, one obtains the echo time 
series as shown in Fig. 6c. It is the matched filtered output as a function of the delay 
time assuming a Doppler shift of 100 Hz. The Doppler Spectrum and echo time series 
are saved for each ping to create the Dopplergram and Doppler-filtered time series.

One finds two tracks in the Doppler space in Fig. 7. One, denoted by A, is 
concentrated at 100 Hz, decreasing to 75 Hz near the end, and the other, denoted by 
B, stays between -20 and 0 Hz.  Dopplergram follows the same concept as Lofargram 
used in passive sonar. In passive narrowband detection, given a snapshot spectrum, 
there are likely many spectral peaks that are not associated with the target.  Given a 
continuous record (Lofargram), target detection is improved since target spectral lines 
are continuous with time whereas the spurious lines are usually not.  The same 
concept is adopted for a Dopplergram.  The Dopplergram (Fig.7) suggests two (or 
more) potential moving targets (based on the aggregation of data points around two 
bands of Doppler frequencies): one with high Doppler shift or high radial speed, and 
the other with low Doppler shift, or low radial speed.  The high Doppler returns have 
much higher intensities than the low Doppler returns, suggesting higher target 
strengths.  Note that for harbor protection, one is interested in detecting an incoming 
underwater vehicle with high speed or Doppler.  In general, one can use Dopplergram 
to track a moving object through the closet point of approach as discussed in Ref. 9. 
For this experiment, one knows that there is no target moving with a small 
radial-speed.  The low Doppler returns must be some kind of reverberation returns.  
The origin of this low Doppler returns is discussed in the next subsection.

Applying the same processing to the low Doppler band between  -20 to 0 Hz, 
the echo time series of the ambiguity surfaces for each ping are plotted as a function 
of the delay and stacked over the transmission time as shown in Fig. 8b.  One finds 
that the low Doppler returns show a similar arrival pattern (with the same slopes) and 
can be identified as the “same” reverberation returns seen in Fig. 4.   
What could be the origin of these negative Doppler returns?  (None of such 
returns were reported in published literature to our knowledge.)  Possible sources that 
can contribute to the low Doppler backscattered returns are rough sea surfaces and 
wave generated bubbles, wakes generated by the tow ship, ocean currents, etc.  Upon 
further examination, one finds that the reverberation could not come from the surface 
waves as the sea is relatively smooth based on visual observation during the 
experiment.  Small sea surface ripples (at the scale of the acoustic wavelength) are 
expected to be random and isotropic in the absence of directional waves. For this 
scenario, one expects that the backscattered returns from the surface waves should 
have a Doppler shift with a mean centered at zero Doppler.  Second, the reverberation 
could not have come from the ship wakes (and bubbles generated by the ship) since 
the reverberation level did not increase as the ship gets close to the source/receiver.  
Third, one observes that reverberation is much more diffused in non-target than target 
directions (based on data collected on receivers pointing at other directions, which are 
not discussed in this paper). This suggests that the scatterers are moving more or less 
in one direction (target look direction) away from the sonar. The most likely source 
for the scattered returns is debris/fish/shrimp flowing with the ocean tidal current.  In 
the post analysis, we found some Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data 
collected in a nearby island (Martha's vineyard) which measured the tidal current 
around the experiment time, showing that the experiment took place at about 2 hours 
after the high tide.  The current speed measured by ADCP was 0.1 - 0.2 m/s, which is 
consistent with a Doppler shift of about 10-20 Hz found in the data.  We thus 
hypothesize that the low Doppler returns are backscattered returns from volume 
inhomogeneities or volume reverberation in short. 
One notes that the high-level low-Doppler returns in the echo time series in 
Fig. 8b are less dense than the high-level volume reverberation returns in Fig. 4. This 
is due to the fact that Fig. 8b only plots the echo time series associated with the 
(highest) peak of each ambiguity surface. In principle, if the low Doppler returns are 
volume reverberation, they will likely show up as multiple peaks in the ambiguity

FIGURE 9 (a) Probability distribution of the reverberation amplitude sampled at a 
delay time of 0.1 s. The LFM data (dashed line) show a non-Rayleigh distribution 
whereas the Doppler-filtered residue reverberation, shown by the solid line marked 
with +, follows a Rayleigh-like distribution. The solid line shows the Doppler-filter 
residue reverberation with a smaller bandwidth. (b) The corresponding probability of 
false alarm (Pfa) as a function of the reverberation level. 
 
We next investigate the amplitude distribution of the residue reverberation 
after applying the Doppler processing.  We apply the same analysis to the Doppler 
filtered echo time series in Fig. 8a at a delay time of 0.1 s, excluding the data samples 
when target is present.  The result is shown in Fig. 9a by the solid line marked by the 
plus sign; it is reasonably well fitted by a Rayleigh distribution. Alternatively, one can 
evaluate the reverberation statistics using the Dopplergram (Fig. 7) by taking samples 
30-50 Hz away from the target Doppler over all transmission time.   One finds that 
this method yields a similar distribution as the above method (the result not shown 
here).  We note that the m-sequence data has ~56% more bandwidth than the LFM 
data.  To study the bandwidth dependence, we apply a band pass filter to the time 
series in Fig. 8a limiting the bandwidth to 10 kHz and renormalize the time series to 
have the same variance as that before the filter.  The result is shown in Fig. 9a by the 
solid line. It has basically the same distribution as that found from the original 
(Doppler filtered) time series, i.e., the solid line marked by the plus sign. Using the 
first method, one finds that while the distributions of the amplitudes remain Rayleigh-
like at “all” delay time, the mean amplitude of the residue reverberation varies with 
the delay time since the total reverberation is a function of the delay time (or range). 
 
 
23 
questions have been studied extensively at low frequencies, little is known at high 
frequencies, nor can we answer these questions without detailed environmental 
measurements; detailed bathymetry and sound speed profiles were not available 
during the experiment. In this section we limit ourselves to two basic questions: How 
much shadowing would directional sonar produce for a more or less flat bottom, and 
can the mean signal level data be reasonably modeled?

FIGURE 10 Received signal level (RL) as a function of range for: two out-bound runs 
(b) and one in-bound run (c).  The ship tracks are shown on the left (a) together with 
bathymetry in the inner harbor (bottom depth in meter).  Data and ship tracks are 
associated by color. 
 
To model TL, we map out the bottom depth along the ship tracks using the 
bathymetry chart for the inner harbor (see the color plot in Fig. 10a).  For run 2, one 
finds that the propagation path (red line in Fig. 10a) encounters a "seamount" which 
rises ~10 m above the bottom in a water of average depth of 12 m.  The relatively 
large variation of the received level (Fig. 10c) may be related to the upslope 
enhancement and down slope spread of the signal over the "seamount".  For run 1, the 
bottom bathymetry is shown in Fig. 10a up to 400 m range, beyond that the bottom is 
assumed flat for lack of data.  Since the bathymetry along run 2 is not known in detail, 
we shall concentrate on run 1. For the TL calculation in a range dependent 
environment with a directional source, we use the Bellhop ray tracing program.19 The

VI.  SYSTEM IMPLICATIONS  
 To model the detection performance, one needs to know the target strength 
and echo amplitude statistics. The former is not measured although one can estimate it 
theoretically based on the manufacturer’s specification. The latter (statistical 
distribution) requires a large amount of data which we don’t have. While the system 
performance is beyond the scope of this paper, some implications can be drawn based 
on the data presented above (see below). 
A.  Normalized reverberation time series 
The active sonar return is often processed/displayed in terms of the so-called 
normalized reverberation time series.  In this processing, one cross-correlates the 
replica with sliding windows of data, with length equal to the replica, and normalizes 
the results by the square-root of the energy of the sliding windows of data.20 If the 
replica is already normalized to have unit energy, then the maximum of the 
correlation is unity.  This processing can be used to suppress the background 
reverberation which is random in nature, since the normalized cross-correlation of the 
replica with a random set of data is near zero.  On the other hand, discrete or target 
like returns are expected to have high cross-correlations. The high value reverberation 
returns in the normalized time series (that are not targeted related) are generally 
referred to as clutter.   
 
 
27 
one evaluates the amplitude distribution for the clutter return at ~0.1 s delay. One 
finds that the amplitude statistics of the normalized returns have almost an identical 
distribution as that determined from the matched filtered output, i.e., the dashed line 
(LFM data) in Fig. 9a, except that the amplitude is scaled down by a factor of ~10. 
This suggests that the reverberation (clutter)  returns at ~0.1 s are from discrete 
scatterers rather than random spatially distributed objects.  For data that are clutter 
dominated, normalization does not seem to (significantly) improve the signal-to-
reverberation ratio.  Target tracking at longer ranges (round trip delay time > 0.25 s) 
is facilitated using the normalized display shown in Fig. 13.

FIGURE 13 Target echo level (marked by ‘+’) compared with the peak level of the 
reverberation time series within 25 ms of the target signal (the solid line). Levels are 
estimated from individual ping data and displayed as a function of two-way travel 
time to the target (delay time): (a) the LFM data and (b) the m-sequence data. 
 
For the m-sequence data, since it is almost reverberation free, normalization 
does not show a dramatic effect except in leveling the background reverberation level 
to a near constant.  The signal to reverberation level remains practically unchanged. 
Note that the matched filtered outputs (the un-normalized data) display the 
 
 
29 
reverberation ratio (SPRR) is at times improved by > 10 dB using Doppler processing 
(comparing the m-sequence versus the LFM results). Note that the signal to 
reverberation ratio is, to a large extent, independent of the source level in a 
reverberation limited environment. 
The improved SPRR is evident in the Dopplergram (Fig. 7) due to the low   
reverberation background.  One can determine the SPRR following the second 
method mentioned in Sec. IV, based on the Dopplergram (Fig. 7). Using this method, 
the peak reverberation level can be estimated from the reverberation level over an 
area at, say, several Hertzs away, from the target track.  The result is approximately 
the same as that shown in Fig. 13b. 
One notes that the target echo level has a ~10 dB drop in Fig. 13 b after a 
round trip delay time of ~ 0.22 s preventing target detection beyond this time.  The 
reason for such a drop is not understood.  If the decrease in target echo level is due to 
decreased processing gain (due to e.g., decrease of coherence time with range), one 
expects that the drop to be gradual with respect to range.   It is suspected that the drop 
is amplifier related due to the higher duty cycle caused by the longer time duration of 
the m-sequence signal. 
C. Early Warning 
Detection based on first tracking the target may require many pings and 
extensive data processing. For defense against underwater swimmers, due to their 
limited speed, delayed detection may not be a problem since there is sufficient time to 
take action. For a fast approaching object, such as an unmanned underwater vehicle 
(filled with explosives, for example), delayed detection and high false alarm rates 
may be intolerable since time is critical, and a missed decision may carry grave 
consequences.  One needs an early warning system which can detect the intruder with 
high confidence based on a single or a few snapshots of data.  The Doppler-delay 
ambiguity surfaces, as shown in Fig. 14, for selected pings, may serve as an early 
warning tool. To do so, the ambiguity surfaces must cover a wide range of delay and 
Doppler based on possible target ranges and speeds. Looking at Fig. 14a, the target 
echo was not detected at Tx Time of 45 s. This figure (Fig. 14a) reflects essentially 
the background level of the reverberation in the delay-Doppler space. The presence of 
a target is unambiguous at Tx Time = 85 s as shown in Fig. 14b. The target is initially 
detected at Tx Time of 60 s (Fig. 14c), as indicated by a small peak (with >5 dB

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The Doppler properties of the target echo and reverberation are analyzed in 
this paper based on data collected in the Woods Hole Harbor. One finds that: (1) The 
matched filtered outputs using the LFM signal show many high level backscattered 
returns (clutter) in the target look direction that are not target related. (2) Using the 
Doppler sensitive waveforms, the target and clutter show up with different Doppler.  
The clutter is found to have a negative Doppler shift of -10 to 0 Hz at the carrier 
frequency, or equivalently a speed of ~0.15 m/s moving away in the target look 
direction.  A plausible cause for the low Doppler clutter is backscattering returns from 
debris/fishes/shrimps carried by the tidal currents in the harbor.  They are referred to 
as volume reverberation. (3) Target and clutter can be separated using Doppler 
processing. Target and clutter can be tracked using Dopplergram. (4)  The high level 
volume reverberation returns have a non-Rayleigh (heavy-tailed) amplitude 
distribution.  (5) The background reverberation after Doppler filtering has in general a 
low level Rayleigh-like amplitude distribution.  (6) The Doppler filtered time series 
shows a much higher SPRR than that found in the LFM data. This is due to the fact 
that the clutter has largely been removed.  (7) The wideband ambiguity surface using 
Doppler sensitive waveforms can be used to detect a moving target based on 
individual ping data due to the low (residue) reverberation level in the high Doppler 
space.  The target speed can be used as a cue for early warning. 
In this study we have used m-sequence signal due to its excellent (cyclic 
orthogonal) auto-correlation property which is responsible for the low sidelobe levels 
in the wideband ambiguity surface.  Selected m-sequences also have good cross-
correlation properties (at arbitrary delay) yielding minimal inter-sequence interference 
as demonstrated in code-division multiple-accessing underwater acoustic 
communications.21  This suggests that multiple active sonar systems can be 
distributed around the harbor, pointing at different directions, transmitting different 
m-sequence signals that are orthogonal to each other.  The advantages are that they 
can be operated simultaneously with minimal interference from other transmitted 
signals.

are present in the data, split-window normalization tends to highlight the clutter
