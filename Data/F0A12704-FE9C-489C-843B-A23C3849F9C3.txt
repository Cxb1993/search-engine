1. Introduction and Goal of this Project 
Dynamic systems with time-delay or dead-time are usually common in chemical processes 
and long transmission lines [7]. This phenomenon is generally from a variety of sources, 
including physical transport delay (e.g., in a rolling mill or in a chemical plant), signal 
transmission delay (e.g., in an earth based satellite control system or in a system controlled over a 
network) [2, 7, 12, 13, 15]. A typical approach for the analysis and synthesis of nonlinear system 
with time delay is local linearization [2, 13]. This only guarantees the local stability of nonlinear 
system.  
Recently, the intelligent systems have attracted great attention from both academic and 
industrial communities. They have been successfully used in widely various applications [3-11, 
19-25]. Especially, the fuzzy neural network systems (or neuro-fuzzy systems) combine the 
advantages of fuzzy logic systems and neural networks have become a very active subject in 
many scientific and engineering areas, such as, model reference control problems, PID controller 
tuning, signal processing, etc. [4, 9-11]. To date, the fuzzy neural system as been an alternative 
approach to conventional controller techniques for complex control problem. These systems have 
the properties of parallel computation scheme, easy to implement, fuzzy logic inference system, 
and parameters convergence [4, 9-11]. The fuzzy rules can be designed and trained from 
linguistic information and numeric data. That is, it is then easy to design an FNN system to 
achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy by manipulating the network structure and learning 
algorithm of the FNN. 
The TSK-type fuzzy dynamic model, proposed by Takagi and Sugeno [19-21], is described 
by fuzzy IF-THEN rules, which represents local linear input-output relations of nonlinear systems. 
In previous literature [19-25], several stable fuzzy controller design approach based on TSK-type 
fuzzy model have been proposed. These fuzzy models are obtained directly from the dynamic 
mathematical functions of nonlinear system. It is contradict for fuzzy control approach.  
In this project, we propose the Time-Delay-Fuzzy-Neuro systems (TDFN systems) to 
identify and control a class of nonlinear uncertain system with input time-delay. Using the TDFN 
system, the input-output states of nonlinear uncertain system are firstly used to identify the 
system. After training process, the system is represented by several Takai-Sugeno fuzzy if-then 
rules. The consequent part of each fuzzy rule is a linear system with input time delay. 
Subsequently, a novel method to design the Smith predictor base fuzzy PID controller for 
nonlinear uncertain systems is proposed. Based on parallel distribution compensation (PDC) 
approach, the Smith predictor compensation and dominate pole assignment technique are then 
adapt to design the fuzzy PID controller. Several simulations are shown to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of our approach.  
 
2. Description of Nonlinear Systems with Input Time-delay 
In general, most of physical systems are nonlinear and complex, which can be described as 
the following system 
))(),(()( tutxftx =&             (1) 
where ntx ÂÎ)( , rtu ÂÎ)( are the state vector and control input vector, respectively. Without 
loss of generality, the equilibrium point is set to be the origin. It is well known that there is no 
generalization method to analyze the nonlinear system (1) [16, 20]. Therefore, the linearized 
system is usually adapted to approximate system (1) to have system’s local properties and 
characteristics. Hence, the linearized system at the origin equilibria for (1) can be described as  
 )()()( tButAxtx +=&            (2) 
where nnA ´ÂÎ  and rnB ´ÂÎ . 
Time-delay or deadtime is frequently encountered in dynamical systems. This phenomenon 
is generally from the result of transmission of information between different parts of systems [2, 
7, 12, 13, 15]. Herein, we consider the transmission time-delay, the control input is thus replaced 
by )( q-tu . Therefore,  
))(),(()( q-= tutxftx& .          (3) 
In this paper, the nonlinear uncertain system with unknown input dead-time system (3) is 
 3 
network structure, called Time-Delay TSK-type Fuzzy Neuro systems (TDFN systems). The 
TDFN system contains the concept of neural network and the ability of learning from information. 
The structure of the TDFN system is shown in Fig. 3.  
Herein, we indicate the signal propagation and the basic function of every node in each layer. 
In the following description, )(kiu  denotes the ith input of a node in the kth layer; 
)(k
iO  denotes 
the ith output in layer k; and )(kinet  denotes the integration function result of the ith node in layer 
k. 
 
Layer 1: input layer 
For the ith node of layer 1 , the net input and the net output are: 
)()1()1( tuO ii = .             (8) 
Each node of the first layer transports the input to the membership layer. 
Layer 2:membership layer 
In this layer, each node performs a membership function, the I/O representation of each node 
is

3.2. Learning Algorithm for TDFN System 
Given a nonlinear uncertain system with input time delay (3), the object of learning is to 
model it by TDFN system from input and output data. If the unknown system can be 
approximated by the learned TDFN system, then, a fuzzy PID controller designed based on the 
TDFN system is available for the original system. Herein, a supervised learning algorithm, 
back-propagation (BP), is used to train the TDFN model for approximating system (3). 
Firstly, we define the cost function (or Error function) as

5. Conclusion 
This project has proposed the TDFN system for identifying and control a class of nonlinear 
uncertain system with unknown input time-delay. The uncertain unknown system was accuracy 
identified by training the TDFN system. The nonlinear uncertain system can be represented by 
several TSK-type fuzzy if-then rules. Using the identification results, a novel method to design 
the SP base fuzzy PID controller for nonlinear uncertain systems was proposed. Based on PDC 
approach, the smith predictor compensation and dominate pole assignment technique are then 
adapt to design the control performance and characteristics of the closed-loop system. Finally, the 
stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov approach. Several simulations 
are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TDFN approach.
