Abstract
This study is intended to provide an inverse
method for estimating the strength of heat source in a
non-Fourier heat conduction problem. In this study,
finite-difference methods are employed to discretize
the problem domain, and then a linear inverse model is
constructed to identify the unknown heat source
condition. The matrix forms of the original differential
governing equations are rearranged in order that the
unknown conditions can be represented explicitly, and
the linear least-squares method is then adopted to
determine their solution. The results show that the
proposed method is capable of generating precise
solutions using just a small number of measuring
points. Furthermore, it is indicated that the method is
capable of providing good numerical approximations
even where measurement errors are present. The
phenomenon of complicated reflection and interaction
of thermal waves reflects the fact that the inverse non-
Fourier heat conduction problem is different from the
inverse Fourier heat conduction problem. In contrast to
traditional approaches, the proposed inverse analysis
method: requires no prior information regarding the
functional form of the unknown quantities. In addition,
only one iteration is necessary for calculation, and no
initial guess is required. Furthermore, the existence
and uniqueness of the solutions can be easily identified.

Introduction
The inverse source problem is the
determination of the strength of the heat source from
the temperature measured at a different point other
than the source locations. It is practical in much design
and manufacturing areas in which the strength of the
heat source is undetermined. Common problems
include the detection of the quantity of the energy
generation in a computer chip, or in a microwave
heating process, or in a chemical reaction process.
Fourier’s law is usualy used to describe the 
heat transfer process and to predict the temperature
distribution in general problem. This approach is
sufficiently accurate for engineering problems under
regular conditions [1]. On the other hand, for situations
involving very low temperatures near absolute zero,
very high temperature gradients, or extremely short
times, heat is found to propagate at a finite speed. For
these situations, the hyperbolic heat conduction (HHC)
model is employed to account for the phenomena of
finite heat propagation speed. Such non-Fourier
conduction equations have been used successfully to
examine rapid transient conduction processes in
chemical process engineering [2], laser pulse heating
[3], and laser annealing [4]. Guo and Xu [5] addressed
the non-Fourier conduction in an IC chip with
emphasis on the discrepancy from the Fourier
conduction and its influence on thermal reliability.
Chan and Lin [6-8] have developed a powerful
numerical technique with a hybrid application of the
Laplace transfer and control-volume methods to solve
HHC problems. Many researchers have explored the
HHC problem of electronic component cooling in the
form of a ‘direct problem’, in which the heat flux or 
temperature histories at the surface of a solid are
treated as functions of time and then the temperature
distribution is found. However, when the heat flux or
temperature at electronic components is very high or
other special situations are concerned, direct
measurement of surface conditions is impossible.
Practicaly, ‘inverse problems’ are applied in these
cases. Measurements of temperature are often made at
one or more interior locations of the substrate. Then
these measurements are curve-fitted to estimate
physical quantities and surface conditions.
To date, there are only limited numbers of
researches that work in the inverse source problem
[10-17]. Most analytical and numerical methods have
only been used to deal with the Fourier’s conduction 
problem. For the HHC problem, the previous studies
[2-7] are restricted to the analysis of one-dimensional
direct problems. Due to the complicated reflection and
interaction of thermal waves, multi-dimensional
hyperbolic heat conduction problems are much more
difficult to solve than one-dimensional problems.
Therefore, to the authors’ knowledge, the inverse 
source problem for dealing with multi-dimensional
hyperbolic heat conduction problems has never been
studied. In order to complement this deficiency, at
least in part, of the literature in this field, this study
was intended to further recent studies of the
methodologies [18, 20] for solving inverse heat
conduction problem (IHCP). The method rearranges
the matrix form of the direct problem in order to
represent the unknown conditions explicitly. Then, the
inverse model can be solved through the least square
error method. The advantage of applying this method
in inverse analysis is that no prior information is
needed on the functional form of the unknown
quantities, and initial guess and iteration is not

where R= T111T1 )BA()]BA()BA[(  is the
reverse matrix of the inverse problems.
Equation (11) is assumed to represent the
measurements of all discretized points in the problem.
In most cases, not all of the points are needed to be
measured. Therefore, only part of matrix R and T,
and part of vector  that correspond to the
measuring positions need to be constructed. In
general, when a large portion of the matrices and
vector is selected, the number of transducers or
measuring points is large. Therefore, the cost of
computation and experiment increases. However, a
larger number of measuring points yield more
accurate estimated results.
In equation (11), the inverse problem is
solved by using the linear least-squares error method
so that the problem is solved in a linear domain to
avoid the iterative process. When the rank of the
reverse matrix is equal to the number of the unknown
variables, then: 1) If the matrix of equation (10) is
consistent, a solution exists and is unique; 2) If the
matrix equation is inconsistent, a unique least-squares
solution can be approximated.
Results and Discussion
The inverse problem defined by Eqs. (3) - (5)
is used in the following examples to verify the
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of the proposed
method for estimating the strength of the heat sorce
(x,y,t). All the computation is performed on a PC
with an 80486 microprocessor. Considering the
capacity of memory, each of the dimensionless spatial
intervals 0.0x1.0, and 0.0y1.0 is divided
into 8 intervals for all examples of the direct problem.
Twenty steps of dimensionless time are taken. The
iteration step corresponds to a mesh size of x =
y = 0.125, and t = 0.1.
The exact dimensionless temperature and the
heat sorce  (x,y,t) used in the following examples
are preselected so that these functions can satisfy
equations (3)-(5). The accuracy of the proposed
method is assessed by comparing the estimated
results with the preselected values of the heat sorce
 (x,y,t). Meanwhile, the temperature distributions
at some specific positions where the thermocouples
are assumed to be installed are generated from the
preselected exact dimensionless temperature in each
case of the board. In a real engineering application,
the temperature measurements are always subject to a
certain degree of measurement error. Hence, the
simulated temperature value used in the inverse
method, is given by:
T measurement = T exact (1+) (12)
where T exact is the exact temperature calculated
from the direct problem, T measurement is the
measured temperature at the grid points,  is
temperature measurement error, and  is the
random error of measurement and lies within the
range of -1 to 1. The measurement errors are caused
by the interpolation of the measuring instruments,
uncertainty due to calibration, and fluctuation in
sensor reading during measurement.
In the simulation problem, the accuracy of the
estimation of unknowns from the knowledge of the
temperature at measurement points depends strongly
on the accuracy of the measurements. As will be seen
in the examples, the estimated solutions without
measurement error ( = 0) converge to the solutions
solved by the finite-difference method for all
examples. Furthermore, the solutions are unique
through the proposed verifying method. Detailed
descriptions for the problem are presented as follows.
Example 1:
The unknown heat sorce  (x,y,t) is taken
as:
(x,y,t)=1.0 0.0t1.0 x=0.375, y=0.375
(x,y,t)=0.0 1.0t2.0 x=0.375, y=0.375
The estimated value using two measurement
points (x,y) = (0.25, 0.25), (0.5, 0.5) without
considering measurement errors are presented in Fig.
1. The inverse values from the present study are a
litter difference with the direct solutions. In the
Fourier heat conduction problem without
measurement errors that has a better estimated values.
Due to the complicated reflection and interaction of
the thermal waves, it is difference from the inverse
Fourier heat conduction problem
Fig. 1 also shows a comparison of the
estimated heat sorce  (x,y,t) for measurement
errors of  = 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10.0% with two
measurement points (of positions located at (x,y) =
(0.25, 0.25) (0.5, 0.5)). The result shows that the
magnitudes of the discrepancies in heat sorce heat
sorce (x,y,t), are directly proportional to the size
of measurement errors. The average discrepancies
between the estimated quality of (x,y,t) and the
exact value are 3.54%, 8.09% and 10.97% for the
cases of  = 0.1%,  = 1.0% and  = 10.0%,
respectively.
Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the estimated
heat sorce (x,y,t) for measurement error of  =
10.0% with two cases of sensor locations at (x,y) =
(0.25, 0.25) (0.5, 0.5) and (0.25, 0.75) (0.75, 0.25)
with t varying from 0.1 to 2.0 with a 0.1 increment.
The result appears better estimated value when the
sensores near the source location (x,y) = (0.25, 0.25)
(0.5, 0.5). The average discrepancies between the
estimated quality of (x,y,t) and the exact value are
10.97% and 19.09% for the cases of of sensor
locations at (x,y) = (0.25, 0.25) (0.5, 0.5) and (0.25,
0.75) (0.75, 0.25), respectively.
Example 2:
The second example is the same as the first
example, except that the unknown heat sorce
(x,y,t) are expressed in different forms as:
 (x,y,t)= t 0.0t1.0 x=0. 5, y=0. 5
 (x,y,t)= 2.0- t 1.0t2.0 x=0. 5, y=0. 5
Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the estimated
quality of (x,y,t) for three cases of measurement
errors, i.e.  = 0.1%, 1.0% and 5.0% with one
measurement point ((x,y) = (0.375, 0.375)) and
dimensionless time interval of t =0.01~2.0 in this
