Abstract 
Based on the nonlinear observer theory, in the first part of this research a novel virtual 
sensing approach for on-line estimation of important process variables of the injection 
molding was proposed. An on-machine evaluation positively demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the proposed virtual sensing method for the melt flow during the filling 
stage. This virtual sensing approach was further developed into a general observer theory 
for a class of cascade-feedback connected nonlinear systems. 
Organic electronics is viewed as a candidate for next generation electronics. In the 
second part of this research, we took an initiative to investigate how to bring the new 
micro/nano molding ideas, such as micro-capillary molding and micro-contact printing, 
into practical fabrication methods for future polymeric organic electronics. This effort has 
resulted in two novel fabrication approaches: (1) the directional spin-coating, an interesting 
integration of the micro-capillary molding and spin coating and (2) a high-quality 
micro-contact printing with innovative pre-wetting technique.

industry. Many efforts have been devoted to 
understanding how process variables determine 
part qualities. However, instead of regulating 
process variables directly, all existing machine 
controls were designed to regulate machine 
variables because of a lack of proper sensors of 
process variables due to cost, inaccessibility, and 
sometimes appearance concern. The lack of 
proper sensors prompted us to conduct a pilot 
study in which an observer-based virtual sensing 
system for general molding process was 
proposed [1]. In this second phase project, the 
virtual sensing approach has been fully 
developed and evaluated on a commercial 
injection molding machine [2]; the approach 
was then further extended to a general observer 
design theory for a class of cascade-feedback 
connected nonlinear systems [3]. 
With the rapid progress of conductive and 
semiconductive organic materials, the organic 
electronics has been viewed as a potential 
candidate for next generation electronics. In the 
second part of this research, we took an 
initiative to investigate how to bring the new 
micro/nano molding ideas, such as 
micro-capillary molding [4], micro-contact 
printing [5], into practical fabrication methods 
for future organic electronics, in particular, the 
polymeric electronics. This effort resulted in two 
novel fabrication approaches: (1) the directional 
spin-coating, an interesting integration of the 
micro-capillary molding and spin coating [6] 
and (2) a high-quality micro-contact printing 
with innovative pre-wetting technique [7]. 
In the following, the newly developed 
nonlinear observer design for cascade-feedback 
connected systems is highlighted in Section 2, 
and its evaluation on a commercial injection 
molding machine is summarized in Section 3. 
Section 4 introduces the interesting directional 
spin coating technique and its application to 
fabrication of polymeric light emitting diodes 
while Section 5 illustrates the performance 
attainable by the innovative micro-contact 
printing. At the end, a conclusion is prepared in 
Section 6.  
2. Nonlinear Observer for Cascade- 
Feedback Connected Nonlinear Systems 
In this section, we highlight a new 
nonlinear observer design for cascade-feedback 
connected systems [3]. 
2.1 Cascade-Feedback Connected Nonlinear 
Systems in Canonical Form 
Similar to the case of linear systems, the 
following canonical form under a Lie-derivative 
based coordinate transformation is introduced 
for the benefits of characterization of 
observability and observer design for cascade- 
feedback connected nonlinear systems:

following structural requirement is imposed for 
4 
position and nozzle pressure against the direct 
sensor measurements as well as the model 
prediction results. The observer achieved 
favorable performance. Fig. 5 presents the most 
important accomplishment of this work, the 
estimation of the melt front position. Since there 
were no sensors for the melt flow sensing in the 
experiment, indirect references to molding 
characteristics and suitable flow features in the 
measurement data were utilized to assess the 
estimation accuracy for the melt front position. 
In Fig. 4, the typical nozzle pressure portrayed 
two significant deflections, one at 0.1 sec and 
the other at 0.36 sec. Due to the changes in 
geometric shape and size in different sections of 
the mold, these two apparent deflections could 
be attributed to the flow transitions from the 
sprue to runner and then from the runner to 
cavity. As indicated in Fig. 5, the proposed 
high-gain observer estimated that it took 0.09 
sec to fill up the sprue and the melt filled up the 
runner at 0.38 sec. For statistical comparison, 
Fig.’s 6 and 7 respectively illustrate the 
differences, (estimated or predicted 1st transition 
time – 1st deflection time) and (estimated or 
predicted 2nd transition time – 2nd deflection 
time) over the one hundred injections. For the 
last 40 injections, the average error of the 
observer-estimated 1st flow transition time was 
-0.01 sec while the average error of the 
model-predicted time was -0.02 sec. For the 2nd 
flow transition, the average error of the 
observer-estimated times was 0.02 sec, again for 
the last 40 injections, while the average error of 
the model-predicted times was -0.07 sec. Noting 
that the sampling period was 0.01 sec and an 
injection cycle lasted only 0.63 sec, this 
assessment shows that the observer offered 
much better and timely information about the 
characteristic flow transition times than the 
model-predictor did. The assessment positively 
endorses the feasibility of the proposed observer 
for the virtual sensing of the melt-front position 
for the injection molding process.

the DSC for fabrication of organic displays. Fig.

linear array. Fig. 11 was a CCD image of a 
DSC-fabricated PLED array, illustrating 
feasibility of the proposed DSC process. The 
line width and length of the PLEDs were 200 
μm and 18 mm, respectively.

5. Micro-Contact Printing 
Low-temperature processing is crucial for 
fabrication of flexible electronics where most 
materials involved are organic with low 
glass-transition temperatures. To address this 
issue, in this part of the research, a new 
micro-contact printing (μCP) with an innovative 
pre-wetting technique was developed. The 
pre-wetting technique enables two significant 
benefits for fabrication of flexible electronics, 
i.e., the high-quality inking and room- 
temperature printing [7]. 
Fig. 12 describes the four phases of a 
typical μCP process involving a poly(dimethyl 
siloxane) (PDMS) stamp.

The present invention discloses a method of forming linear 
patterns, called “directional spin coating” technology. Parallel banks 
are formed on a substrate to define some trenches; the substrate is 
vertically erected on outer edge of a spin disc; and a liquid material is 
applied to the trenches followed by rotation of the spin disc, and with 
the centrifugal force of rotation, the material is uniformly coated on the 
substrate within individual trenches, forming a linear pattern. The 
thickness of the formed pattern is similar to that achievable using the 
conventional spin-coating approach. The present invention can create 
linear patterns made of more than one material by selectively coating
different materials on specific trenches.
