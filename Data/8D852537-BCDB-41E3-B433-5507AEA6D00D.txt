I.  INTRODUCTION 
 Small particles suspended in a nonisothermal gas acquire a mean velocity relative to the gas 
in the direction opposite to the temperature gradient.  This phenomenon, known as 
thermophoresis, was first described in 1870 by Tyndall, who observed the removal of dust 
particles from air in the vicinity of hot surfaces.
1,2
  Deposition by thermophoresis is of 
considerable practical importance in many industrial applications when hot gases containing small 
suspended particles flow over cool surfaces.  For example, thermophoresis can be effective in 
removing or collecting small particles from laminar gas streams in air cleaning and aerosol 
sampling devices.
3,4
  The phenomenon has also been cited as an origin for the deposition of 
particulate matter on surfaces of heat exchangers causing scale formation with the attendant 
reduction of the heat-transfer coefficient
5,6
 and supporting the development of systems for 
filterless removal of combustion aerosol particles.
7,8
  Convincing evidence has been provided that, 
in the modified chemical vapor deposition process for the manufacture of high-quality optical 
fibers, thermophoresis is the primary mechanism responsible for the deposition of aerosol particles 
(soot) onto the inner walls of the containing tube.
9,10
  On the other hand, deposition of 
contaminant particles by thermophoresis on wafers in clean rooms during manufacturing steps can 
be a major cause of loss of product yields in the microelectronics industry.
11,12
  In the area of 
nuclear safety, knowledge of thermophoresis is required to calculate the deposition rates of 
radioactive aerosol particles released in reactor accident situations where large temperature 
gradients exist.
13,14
   
 The physical explanation of the thermophoretic phenomena is based on kinetic-theory 
argument and depends on the fact that the aerosol particle receives a greater number of molecular 
impacts on its hotter side than on the other side, thus leading to a net rate of change of momentum 
in the direction opposite to the temperature gradient.  On the basis of the assumptions of small 
Knudsen number ( bl / , where b  is the radius of the particle and l  is the mean free path of the 
gas molecules), small Peclet number, and small Reynolds number, as well as the effects of 
temperature jump, thermal slip, and frictional slip at the particle surface, the thermophoretic 
velocity of an aerosol sphere in an infinite expanse with a constant temperature gradient T  can 
be expressed as 
      TT0 U ,                                                            (1)

spheroidal particle along its axis of revolution without temperature jump and frictional slip at its 
surface was also analytically studied.
38,39
  This analysis has been generalized to a spheroid
40
 and a 
particle departing slightly in shape from a sphere
41
 with an arbitrary orientation relative to the 
imposed temperature gradient.  Recently, the thermophoresis of a slightly deformed sphere with 
the effects of temperature jump, thermal slip, and frictional slip at its surfaces was investigated, 
and an explicit expression for the thermophoretic velocity was obtained to the second order in the 
small parameter characterizing the deformation.
42,43
  The thermophoretic motions of a general 
axisymmetric particle
44
 and a prolate or oblate spheroid
45
 with the effects of temperature jump, 
thermal slip, and frictional slip along their axes of revolution were also examined analytically and 
numerically to some extent by using the methods of internal singularity distributions, separation or 
semiseparation of variables in spheroidal coordinates, and boundary collocations.  However, the 
problem of thermophoresis of a general particle of revolution with the jump/slip conditions at its 
surface in an arbitrary direction has not been analytically or numerically solved yet, mainly due to 
the fact that, if the temperature jump and/or frictional slip is included, a separable solution of the 
temperature and/or fluid velocity fields is not feasible for most orthogonal curvilinear coordinate 
systems, such as the prolate and oblate spheroidal ones.   
 In the present report, the method of distributed internal singularities incorporated with the 
boundary collocation technique is used to explore the problem of thermophoretic motion of an 
aerosol particle of revolution with fore-and-aft symmetry perpendicular to its axis of revolution; 
the particle can be either prolate or oblate.  The thermophoretic velocity of the particle as a 
function of the physical and surface properties of the particle-gas system is calculated for various 
cases.  For the special cases of a sphere in general conditions and of a spheroid with no 
temperature jump and frictional slip, our results of the thermophoretic velocity show excellent 
agreement with the exact solutions.
15,40
  For the cases of a spheroid in general conditions whose 
shape deviates slightly from that of a sphere, our results also agree quite well with the approximate 
analytical solution in the literature.
43
  Because the governing equations and boundary conditions 
concerning the general problem of thermophoretic motion of a particle of revolution with 
fore-and-aft symmetry caused by a prescribed moderate temperature gradient in an arbitrary 
direction are linear, its solution can be obtained as a superposition of the solutions for its two 
subproblems: motion along the axis of revolution of the particle, which was previously 
examined,
44,45
 and motion normal to the axis, which is treated in this project. 
 
II.  MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION FOR A PROBLEM OF THERMOPHORESIS 
 We consider the steady thermophoretic motion of an axisymmetric rigid particle with 
 6 
A.  Temperature field 
  For the heat transfer in a system of thermophoresis, the Peclet number can be assumed to be 
small.  Hence, the energy equations governing the temperature distributions are 
  02  T   and  0ˆ2  T                                                   (3) 
for the fluid and particle, respectively. 
 The boundary conditions at the particle surface require that the normal component of heat 
flux be continuous and a temperature jump that is proportional to the normal temperature 
gradient
15
 occur. Also, the fluid temperature far from the particle approaches the undisturbed 
values.  Thus, we can write

where TEn  n , TEn
ˆˆ  n , n  is the unit normal vector at the particle surface pS  
pointing into the fluid, k and kˆ  are the thermal conductivities of the fluid and particle, 
respectively, and tC  is the temperature jump coefficient about the surface of the particle; k, kˆ , 
and tC  are assumed to be constant.  At the temperature range of 300-400 K, kˆ =0.022-0.024 
11 K mW    for silica aerosol and kˆ =0.9-3.0 11 K mW    for clay, soil, and stone, while 
k=0.026-0.033 11 K mW    for air.46   
 In order to solve Eqs. (3)-(5), a set of thermal spherical singularities is chosen and distributed 
along the axis of revolution within a prolate particle or on the fundamental plane within an oblate 
particle.
47,48
  The temperature distributions inside and outside the particle are approximated by 
the superposition of the set of the spherical singularities and the boundary conditions in Eq. (4) on 
the particle surface can be satisfied by making use of the multipole collocation method.  For the 
special case of a spherical particle, only a single singularity which is placed at the particle center is 
needed. 
 The temperature distributions external and internal to the particle caused by a spherical 
singularity at the point ( 1hx  , 2hy  , 3hz  ) are

Eqs. (8a)-(8c).  Owing to its axial and fore-and-aft symmetry, the particle does not rotate during 
thermophoresis.  
 Analogous to the solution procedure for the temperature field presented in the previous 
subsection, Eqs. (9)-(11) can be solved by distributing a set of hydrodynamic spherical 
singularities along the axis of revolution within a prolate particle or on the fundamental plane 
within an oblate particle.  The flow field surrounding the particle is approximated by the 
superposition of the set of the spherical singularities and the boundary condition (10) on the 
particle surface is satisfied by using the multipole collocation method.

A.  Temperature field  
 The temperature field inside and outside the spherical particle produced by the imposed 
thermal gradient can be represented by a spherical singularity placed at its center.  Thus, the 
distributions of the temperature and the components of its gradients for the heat conduction around 
the sphere are given by Eqs. (6) and (8) with 1h 2h 03 h .  To determine the unknown 
constants nH  and nHˆ , one can apply the boundary conditions in Eq. (4) at the particle surface to 
these distributions to yield

 A careful examination of the conditions in Eq. (17) shows that the solution of the coefficient 
matrix generated is independent of the   coordinate of the boundary points on the surface of the 
particle owing to its axially symmetric shape.  To satisfy Eq. (17) exactly along the entire 
half-circular generating arc of the particle in a meridian plane would require the solution of the 
entire infinite array of the unknown constants nH  and nHˆ .  However, the multipole collocation 
method
47-51
 enforces the boundary conditions at a finite number of discrete points on the 
generating arc (values of   between 0 and π ) and truncates the infinite series in Eqs. (6), (8), 
and (17) into finite ones.  If the boundary is approximated by satisfying Eq. (17) at TN  discrete 
points on the generating arc, the infinite series are truncated after TN  terms, resulting in a system 
of T2N  simultaneous linear algebraic equations in the truncated form of Eq. (17).  This matrix 
equation can be solved by any of the standard matrix-reduction techniques to yield the T2N  
unknown constants nH  and nHˆ  required in the truncated form of Eq. (6) for the temperature 
field.  In principle, the accuracy of the truncation technique can be improved to any degree by 
taking a sufficiently large value of TN .   
B.  Fluid flow field  
The fluid flow accompanying the thermophoresis of a spherical particle can be represented by 
 12 
 Since the particle is freely suspended in the surrounding fluid, the net force acting on the 
particle must vanish.  Applying this constraint to Eq. (16), one obtains 
 011 B .                                                                (23) 
To determine the thermophoretic velocity U of the particle, Eq. (23) and the H3N  algebraic 
equations resulting from Eq. (19) are to be solved simultaneously.   
 When specifying the points along the semicircular generating arc of the sphere where the 
boundary conditions are exactly satisfied, the first points that should be chosen are 0  and 
π , since these points define the projected area of the particle normal to the direction of motion.  
In addition, the point 2/π  is also important.  However, an examination of the systems of 
linear algebraic equations (17) and (19) shows that the coefficient matrices become singular if 
these points are used.  To overcome the difficulty of singularity and to preserve the geometric 
symmetry of the particle surface about the equatorial plane 2/π , points at   , 2/π , 
2/π  and π  are taken to be four basic collocation points.  Additional points along the 
boundary are usually selected as mirror-image pairs about the plane 2/π  to divide the   
coordinate into equal parts.  The range of optimum values of   has been found to be quite 
broad, and here we choose 
01.0 , with which the numerical results of the thermophoretic 
velocity of the particle can converge to at least four significant figures.  In principle, as long as 
the number of the collocation points is sufficiently large and the distribution of the collocation 
points is adequate, the solution of the particle velocity will converge and the shape of the particle 
can be well approximated, irrespective of the particle shape or boundary conditions. 
     In our continuum-with-slippage analysis given in the previous section, the Knudsen number 
( bl / ) of the system should be smaller than about 0.1.  As mentioned in the first section, a set of 
well adapted values for the temperature jump and frictional slip coefficients under the condition of 
complete energy and momentum accommodations are 2.18 and 1.14, respectively.  Consequently, 
the normalized coefficients *tC  and 
*
mC  must be restricted to be less than unity.  For 
convenience we will use the ratio 2/ *m
*
t CC  (a rounded value to 2.18/1.14=1.91) throughout the 
article, without loss in reality or generality.  On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of an 
aerosol particle is usually greater than that of the ambient gas.  Thus, the value of the relative 
conductivity *k  will exceed unity under most practical situations. 
 In Table I, a number of numerical solutions of the dimensionless thermophoretic velocity 
ECTU  s0f /  of the aerosol sphere are presented for various values of the parameters 
*
mC  
( 2/*tC ) and 
*k  using the boundary collocation technique.  All of the results were obtained by

viscous stress can be obtained accordingly using Eqs. (8) and (15).

In Section III, collocation solutions for the thermophoretic velocity of a spherical particle 
were presented and shown to be in excellent agreement with the exact solution.  We now use the 
same collocation scheme incorporated with the method of distribution of spherical singularities to 
obtain the solutions for a prolate spheroid.  In Table II, numerical results of the thermophoretic 
velocity U  of a prolate spheroid with *m
*
t 2CC   perpendicular to its axis of revolution 
normalized by the corresponding velocity of a sphere, 0U  given by Eqs. (1) and (2), are 
presented for various values of the aspect ratio ba /  and the parameters *k  and *mC .  The 
values of 0/UU  are computed for different values of TN  ( HN ) and TM  ( HM ) in Eqs. (29) 
and (31) (which shows convergence tests).  For each case, small values of TN  and TM  can 
achieve good convergence behavior for the calculations.  The exact solution of 0/UU  for the 
corresponding thermophoresis of a prolate spheroid with no temperature jump and frictional slip 
( 0*m
*
t CC ) calculated using Eq. (35) is also given in Table II for comparison.   It can be seen  
 18 
that our results from the method of distributed spherical singularities agree very well with the 
exact solution in this limit.  In general, the convergence behavior of the method of spherical 
singularities is quite good, except for the case of relatively large aspect ratio. 
     Recently, the problem of thermophoresis of an aerosol particle with a temperature jump, a 
thermal slip and a frictional slip at the surface whose shape deviates slightly from that of a sphere 
has been analyzed.
43
  The asymptotic formula for the thermophoretic velocity of a spheroidal 
particle correct to the second order in the small parameter characterizing the deformation, 
)/(1 ba , was obtained in a closed form.  The values of the normalized thermophoretic 
mobility 0/UU  of a prolate spheroid (with 0 ) perpendicular to its axis of revolution 
calculated from this approximate formula are also listed in Table II for comparison.  It can be 
found that the asymptotic solution agrees quite well with our collocation solutions for small 
magnitudes of  .  The errors are less than 0.03% for particles with 1.1/1  ba .  However, 
the accuracy of this approximate solution begins to deteriorate, as expected, when the value of a/b 
becomes greater. 
 The numerical solutions for the normalized thermophoretic velocity 0/UU  of a prolate 
spheroid with *m
*
t 2CC   perpendicular to its axis of revolution are plotted versus the inverse 
aspect ratio 1)/( ba , the thermal conductivity ratio *k , and the slip parameter *mC  (proportional 
to the Knudsen number bl / ) in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  The cases of 1* k , which are 
not likely to exist in practice, are considered here for the sake of numerical comparison.  For 
specified values of *k , *tC , and 
*
mC , the value of 0/UU  in general decreases with an increase 
in ba / , as shown in Fig. 2, which is consistent with the trend predicted from Eq. (35) for the 
limiting case of 0*m
*
t CC .  This behavior is understandable since the fraction of the thermal 
slip of the fluid at the particle surface in the direction normal to its axis, which drives the 
movement of the particle, decreases with the increase of ba / .  Therefore, the spherical 
approximation overestimates the transverse thermophoretic mobility for prolate spheroids.

For given finite values of *tC , 
*
mC , and ba / , the value of 0/UU  decreases with an 
increase in *k  when *k  is small, reaches a minimum at some moderate value of *k , and then 
increases with a further increase in *k , as displayed in Fig. 3.  This minimum occurs at a lower 
value of *k  if the value of *tC  )2(
*
mC  is larger or the value of ba /  is greater.  For the 
limiting case of 0*m
*
t CC , however, 0/UU  resulting from Eq. (35) becomes a monotonically 
decreasing function of *k , keeping ba /  as a constant.  The reason for this behavior is that the 
thermophoretic mobility of the spheroid in the direction normal to its axis of revolution increases 
with an increase in *k  and the sensitivity of this dependence increases with a decrease in ba / .
40
 
For fixed values of ba /  and *k , the value of 0/UU  increases monotonically with an 
increase in *tC  )2(
*
mC  when 
*k  is large [e.g., 100* k , as illustrated in Fig. 4(a)], but 
decreases with an increase in *tC  when 
*k  is small [e.g., 1* k , as illustrated in Fig. 4(b)].  
Because the effects of the four parameters *k , *tC , 
*
mC , and ba /  on the thermophoretic 
velocity of a spheroid interact one another in a quite complicated manner,
43
 it would be difficult to 
provide detailed physical analysis for the above observations from Figs. 2-4. 
If the particle velocity in Eq. (31) is disabled (i.e., U=0 is set), then the force obtained from 
Eq. (32) can be taken as the thermophoretic force exerted on the spheroidal particle due to the 
imposed temperature gradient T .  This force can be expressed as 
 *0π6 FbUF  ,                                                         (36) 
where 0U  is the corresponding thermophoretic velocity of a spherical particle of radius b  given 
by Eqs. (1) and (2), and *F  is the normalized magnitude of the thermophoretic force.  The value 
of *F  also equals 0
* /UUf , where *f  is the dimensionless Stokes resistance coefficient of the 
spheroidal particle with the same frictional slip translating perpendicular to its axis of revolution 
driven by a body force in the absence of the temperature gradient
53
 and U is the thermophoretic 
velocity of the spheroidal particle just obtained from the simultaneous solution of Eqs. (31) and 
(32).  
 
VI.  THERMOPHORESIS OF OBLATE PARTICLES  
 The thermophoretic motion of a prolate particle with axial and fore-and-aft symmetry 
perpendicular to its axis of revolution was considered in Section IV and a set of spherical 
singularities was distributed on a segment along the axis of revolution within the particle.  In this 
section we consider the corresponding thermophoresis of an oblate particle and the spherical 
 24 
where the functions nmM1 , nmM1
ˆ , and nmM 2  are given by Eq. (18) with the subscript n  of its 
functions being replaced by nm  [see the definitions below Eq. (A36)].  Thus, the collocation 
technique described in Sections III and IV can be used to satisfy the boundary condition (41) to 
determine the TT2 MN  density constants nmH   and nmHˆ   required for the temperature field in 
Eq. (40). 
    Similarly, the integration in Eq. (38) can be approximated by applying Eq. (27), with the 
expressions

results indicate that the shape (e.g., prolate or oblate) and the relative physical and surface 
properties of a nonspherical particle can have significant effects on its thermophoretic behavior.  
Although the numerical solutions were presented in the previous sections only for the 
thermophoresis of a sphere, a prolate spheroid and an oblate spheroid, the combined analytical and 
numerical technique utilized in this work can easily provide the calculations for the 
thermophoretic velocity of an axially and fore-and-aft symmetric particle of other shapes, such as 
a prolate or oblate Cassini oval.
47
   
It is worth repeating that our results are obtained on the basis of a continuum model for the 
gas phase with a slip-flow boundary condition at the particle surface.  For a perfect gas, the 
kinetic theory predicts that the mean free path of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the 
pressure.  As examples, the mean free path of air molecules at 25 
o
C is about 67 nm at 1 atm and 
is about 51 m at 1 torr.54  Therefore, our results obtained with the assumption of small Knudsen 
number can be used for a broad range of particle sizes (about 0.5 m or larger) around atmospheric 
pressure but is only applicable for relatively large particles (about 0.1 mm or larger) at low 
pressures. 
   The thermophoresis of an axisymmetric aerosol particle with a temperature jump, a thermal 
slip, and a frictional slip at its surface along its axis of revolution was investigated by using a 
similar method of internal singularity distributions
44
 and the corresponding motion of a prolate or 
oblate spheroid was also analyzed by using a method of separation or semiseparation of variables 
in spheroidal coordinates,
45
 and analytical and numerical results of the thermophoretic mobility for 
the particles with various values of aspect ratio were obtained.  It was found that, for specified 
values of *k , *tC , and 
*
mC , the value of the normalized axisymmetric thermophoretic mobility 
0/UU  of a spheroid in general increases with an increase in ba / , since the fraction of the 
thermal slip of the fluid at the particle surface in the direction along its axis of revolution increases 
with the increase of ba / .  For given finite values of *tC , 
*
mC , and ba / , the value of 0/UU  
of a prolate (oblate) spheroid increases (decreases) with an increase in *k  when *k  is small, 
reaches a maximum (minimum) at some moderate value of *k , and then decreases (increases) 
with a further increase in *k .  For fixed values of ba /  and *k , the value of 0/UU  of a 
prolate (oblate) spheroid decreases (increases) with an increase in *tC  )2(
