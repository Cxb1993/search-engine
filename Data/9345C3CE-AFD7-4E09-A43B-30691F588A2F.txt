1. Abstract 
This project presents an optimal control scheme 
for a multilevel inverter working for motor drive 
or audio power amplification. The proposed 
control scheme comprises two loops of feedback 
around a sliding-mode quantizer. The 
double-loop feedback generates a continuous 
equivalent control signal, while the quantizer 
which operates in the sliding mode converts the 
equivalent control signal into a staircase voltage 
used to drive a loudspeaker through an LC filter 
for audio signal tracking. The control scheme is 
optimized to reduce the frequency weighted 
tracking error and the equivalent control signal 
simultaneously, compromising between a 
satisfactory performance and a wide stable input 
range. With the proposed design, a nine-level 
class-D audio amplifier is built and tested, which 
exhibits high robustness and high quality audio 
reproduction with the THD+N as low as 
0.0045% for a 1kHz test input.

2. Project Purpose and Literature Review 
Using a multilevel inverter is superior to 
conventional two-level power amplification in 
many ways [1-3]. A multilevel inverter switches 
an array of DC voltage sources to generate a 
staircase output waveform, performing 
amplitude modulation and pulse modulation 
simultaneously [4-6]. In comparison with a 
two-level inverter undertaking only pulse 
modulation, a multilevel inverter generates less 
noise and distortion when switching at the same 
rate, and is particularly appropriate for 
high-power applications owing to its ability to 
allow power electronic devices to operate at 
lower frequencies and lower voltages [7-9]. 
Above advantages come at a cost of more 
complex modulation and control schemes.  
This work presents a novel multilevel control 
scheme for a nine-level inverter by integrating 
frequency-shaped optimal control [10] with 
multilevel sliding- mode modulation [11]. Based 
on control optimization and sliding-mode 
modulation, the proposed control scheme 
inherits many of their nice attributes: 
●Noise shaping: The noise and distortion 
incurred by multilevel control or other 
disturbances are highly attenuated in the audio 
band through optimal control;  
●Enlarged stable input range: The controller is 
optimized to track a reference input with a 
small control force to certain precision, thus 
enlarging the trackable input range under the 
limitation of the maximum control level;  
●Sliding-Mode Operation: Unlike the 
sliding-mode multilevel control scheme 
proposed by [12], which modulates by 
correcting the control level to steer the system 
towards the sliding mode, the proposed control 
scheme directly locates a precise level to 
ensure the system is always in the sliding 
mode;  
●Tractable simple behavior: The sliding- mode 
modulation linearizes the multilevel control,

bridge inverter driving an 8Ω loudspeaker 
through an LC filter, from two isolated battery 
supplies 6V and 18V. Each MOSFET switch is 
connected in parallel with a turn-off snubber 
circuit and a flywheel diode for eliminating the 
voltage spike and increasing the efficiency. The 
control circuit is designed to switch the power 
MOSFETs in order to reproduce a given audio 
input waveform r across the speaker. Figure 3 
schematically depicts the whole circuit design. 
The circuit comprises linear filtering part, 
switching logic part, predrive and cascaded 
H-bridge output stage, as well as LC filter and 
load. The first two parts operate from a single 
6V supply, constituting the main control circuit. 
The predrive and cascaded H-bridge output stage 
operates from two separate dc voltage sources 6 
V and 18 V in a cascaded manner, thus capable 
of supplying a waveform of maximum swing 
± 24 V across the LC filter and the speaker. 
Given the lower operating voltage of the control 
circuit, the feedback signals including state x, 
control u, and output y are all scaled down with a 
gain of 1/12. Consequently, the class-D amplifier 
has a gain of twelve in voltage amplification. As 
one of the state variables, the inductor current i 
is estimated by a current estimator rather than 
directly measured by a current sensor. The 
current estimator is a leaky integrator that 
emulates an actual inductor with inductance L 
and loss resistance RL, accumulating the inductor 
voltage and generating a proportional output that 
approximates the inductor current.  
The linear filtering part consists of feedback 
compensator H, state feedback gain K=[k1 k2], 
the integrator, and the inductor current estimator 
in Fig. 3. The plant is the LC-plus-speaker filter, 
which is lowpass of cutoff frequency 25 kHz and 
has the state space matrices in (16). A high 
SNDR at 80% of the full range output can be 
achieved by selecting design parameters n=3, 
Rs=40 and ωc=4π×104. Using the MATLAB 
program given in Appendix allows us to obtain

The integrator gain is chosen identical to the 
previous result (i.e. k = 2×106). The current 
estimator emulates the inductor in the LC filter 
with inductance L=33×10-6 H and loss resistance  
RL=0.1 Ω. Figure 4 displays the linear filtering
