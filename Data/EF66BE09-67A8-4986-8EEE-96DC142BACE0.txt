with
i = −i,
uv = u¯v¯ = v¯u¯, u, v ∈ C.
The complex-valued function which is defined in the domain Ω ⊂ R2 is represented as
f(x) = f2(x) + if1(x), (2)
where fi : R2 → R and f : R2 → C. On the basis of the above definition, the complex differential
operator can be written as follows:
DC =
∂
∂x2
+ i
∂
∂x1
. (3)
This is so-called Cauchy-Riemann operator and its conjugate operator is
DC =
∂
∂x2
− i ∂
∂x1
. (4)
It can be proved that these operators are equal to the operators 2 ∂∂z¯ and 2
∂
∂z , respectively.
According to Eqs.(3) and (4), the relation between the two-dimensional Laplace operator 42
and the complex differential operators is found as follows:

is called a holomorphic function. In complex analysis, a holomorphic function is exactly an analytic
function, that is an infinitely differentiable function which can be expanded as a convergent Taylor
series. A function satisfying 4f = 0 is called a harmonic function. Eq.(5) shows that a holomorphic
function must be a harmonic function, but the converse is not true in general.
Note: In some literature, the holomorphic function is also termed the regular function.
1.2 Quaternionic algebra H and Quaternionic analysis
1.2.1 Real quaternions and Fueter operator
A quaternion (or, more precisely, a real quaternion) is
a = a4 + e1a1 + e2a2 + e3a3 ∈ H, a1, a2, a3, a4 ∈ R, (6)
where
ekel + elek = −2δkl, k, l = 1, 2, 3,
and
e1e2 = e3.
Conventionally, e1, e2, and e3 are written as i, j, and k, respectively, and a4 is written as a0. The
conjugate a of the quaternion a is
a = a4 − e1a1 − e2a2 − e3a3 ∈ H (7)
2
It should be noted that the operator ∇H and its conjugate ∇H are dependent.
A function f satisfying ∇Hf = 0, i.e. the Moisil-Teodorescu equations

∂f4
∂x3
− ∂f1
∂x2
+
∂f2
∂x1
+ 0 = 0,
is called a monogenic function. A monogenic function must be a harmonic function, but the converse
is not true in general.
It f4 = 0, then f(x) is defined in the 3-dimensional space, and Eq.(10)1 expresses divf = 0, i.e.
no divergence, while Eqs.(10)2−4 express irrotational in the planes 23, 13, 12, respectively. In other
words, Eq.(10) describes a vector field f(x) which is incompressible and irrotational.
1.2.4 Reduced quaternion and Riesz operator
A reduced quaternion is
a = a3 + e1a1 + e2a2, a1, a2, a3 ∈ R, (11)
where
ekel + elek = −2δkl, k, l = 1, 2.
Reduced quaternions form a subset of H, designated by Hr. Subsequently, we define in the domain
Ω ⊂ R3 a function f : Ω→ Hr ⊂ H with reduced quaternion value
f(x) = f3(x) + e1f1(x) + e2f2(x),
where the domain Ω of the function f is in R3, and the range of the function is Hr. If x ∈ Ω ⊂ R3, x
may be treated as a reduced quaternion, and the reduced quaternionic differential operator
DHr =
∂
∂x3
+ e1
∂
∂x1
+ e2
∂
∂x2
, (12)
is called the Riesz operator, and its conjugate operator is
DHr =
∂
∂x3
− e1 ∂
∂x1
− e2 ∂
∂x2
.
The relation between the three-dimensional Laplace operator ∆3 and the Riesz operator can be deduced
as follows:
DHrDHr = DHrDHr = ∆3.
Note that DHr and DHr are independent. If a function satisfies
DHrf = 0, (13)
then one obtains the Riesz equations
∂f3
∂x3
− ∂f1
∂x1
− ∂f2

It is often called the Dirac operator. According to the multiplication rule of the base vectors, the
n-dimensional Laplace operator ∆ can be decomposed as
n∑
k=1
∂2
∂x2k
=: ∆ = ∇∇ = ∇2. (14)
1.4 Clifford algebra C`0,n−1 and Clifford analysis in C`0,n−1
Consider (n− 1)-dimensional anti-Euclidean space R0,n−1 with orthonormal base vectors e1 , e2,
. . ., en−1, and further define the multiplication rule of the base vectors:
ekel + elek = −2δkl, k, l = 1, 2, . . . , n− 1.
The Clifford conjugate (·) is defined by
uv = v¯u¯, u, v ∈ C`0,n−1,
e¯k = −ek, k = 1, 2, · · · , n− 1.
On the basis of the base vectors, the basis {eα} of Clifford algebra C`0,n−1 can be constructed as
follows:
eα = eα1α2...αk = eα1eα2 . . . eαk , 1 ≤ α1 < α2 < . . . < αk ≤ n− 1,
αi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n− 1}.
One further identify eφ with the unit element, eφ = e0 ≡ 1, and then any element a of real Clifford
algebra C`0,n−1(R) can be represented in terms of eα as
a =
∑
α
eαaα,
where aα ∈ R. Similarly, an element of complex Clifford algebra C`0,n−1(C) is written as
a =
∑
α
eαaα, aα ∈ C.
The function which is defined in domain Ω ⊂ R0,n−1 with range C`0,n−1(R) can be represented as
f(x) =
∑
α
eαfα(x).
Using the orthonormal base vectors and the unit element, one can define a first order paravector
differential operator
D :=
∂
∂xn
+
n−1∑
k=1

∂

.
It is often called the Cauchy-Riemann operator. Then the n-dimensional Laplace operator ∆ can be
decomposed as
∆ = DD = DD, (15)
where D
D =

∂xn
−
n−1∑
k=1
ek
∂

.
is the conjugate operator of D.

In addition, it is often seen in the literature and this report that C`n,0(R) and H(R) are simply
denoted by C`n and H, respectively.
2 Complex analysis and Clifford analysis for elasticity problems
In this chapter, by virtue of the experience gained from complex analysis methods for elasticity
problems, we develop Clifford analysis methods for two-dimensional cases and further extend to three-
dimensional cases.
2.1 Elastic problem in 2-dimensional space
Strictly speaking, any elastic problem in quasistatic state is a three dimensional problem. It
should be formulated as partial differential equations with three independent variables. However,
in engineering applications, it can be reduced to a two dimensional problem under some conditions.
Usually, two dimensional problems are divided into plane stress problems and plane strain problems.
Consider a plane strain problem with linearly isotropic elasticity, the constitutive law between
stress σ and strain ε is
σαβ = λδαβεγγ + 2µεαβ , α, β, γ = 1, 2, (17)
where λ and µ are Lame´ constants and δαβ is the Kronecker delta satisfying
δαβ =
{
0, α 6= β,
1, α = β.
For small deformation, the kinematic law and the compatibility condition between displacement u and
strainε are
εαβ =
1
2
(uα,β + uβ,α), α, β = 1, 2, (18)

∂x22
+

, (19)
respectively. And equilibrium equations is
σβα,β + ρbα = 0, α, β = 1, 2. (20)
According to Eqs.(17), (18) and (20), one can deduce two-dimensional equilibrium equations of dis-
placement (Navier-Cauchy equation)
(λ+ µ)uβ,βα + µuα,ββ + ρbα = 0, α, β = 1, 2. (21)
According to Eqs.(17), (18),(19) and (20), one can deduce two-dimensional compatibility equation of
stress (Beltrami-Michell equation)
∆(σ11 + σ22) = −2(λ+ µ)
λ+ 2µ

where ∆ = ∂

denotes two-dimensional Laplace operator.
2.2 Two-dimensional problems of linearly isotropic elasticity without body force
Introducing the potential function (Airy stress function) Φ, which satisfies
σ11 =
∂2Φ
∂x22
, (23)
σ22 =
∂2Φ
∂x21
, (24)
σ12 = − ∂
2Φ

and then one can rewrite Eq.(34) as
∂
∂z¯
∂
∂z
F − ∂
∂z
∂
∂z¯
F = 0.
From Eqs.(32) and (36), the relation between potential function and displacement are derived as
∂
∂z¯
u = − 1
4µ
∂
∂z¯
F. (37)
It is straightforward to show
u = − 1
4µ
F + w (38)
satisfies Eq.(37), in which
∂
∂z¯
w = 0. (39)
Applying the complex differential operator to Eq.(38) and substituting Eq.(35) into it, one obtains
∂
∂z
u = − 1
4µ
(σ11 + σ22 − 2ρV ) + ∂
∂z
w. (40)
Since Eq,(33) is identity with Eq.(40), one obtain
∂
∂z
w =
λ+ 2µ
4µ(λ+ µ)
(σ11 + σ22)− ρ2µV + i
1
2
(u2,1 − u1,2). (41)
Adding the above equation to its conjugate and substituting Eq.(35) into it, one can deduce
∂
∂z
F =
2µ(λ+ µ)
λ+ 2µ
(
∂
∂z
w +
∂
∂z
w)− 2µ
λ+ 2µ
ρV. (42)
If one assume there exist a functionW auch that V = ∂∂zW , the solution of Eq.(42) can be found
as follows:
F =
2µ(λ+ µ)
λ+ 2µ
(w + z
∂
∂z
w)− 2µ
λ+ 2µ
ρW + v,
where z ∈ C and
∂
∂z
v = 0. (43)
Now all physical quantities can be described by the functions w, v and W . In the following, the
complex analysis methods will be further developed into Clifford analysis methods in C`2,0, C`0,2−1
and C`0,2.
2.3.1.2 Clifford analysis method in C`2,0
Let us define the displacement vector in C`2,0
u = e1u1 + e2u2 ∈ C`2,0. (44)
Applying the Dirac operator ∇ to u yields
∇u = (u1,1 + u2,2) + e12(u2,1 − u1,2), (45)
Premultiplying and postmultiplying the Dirac operator by e1 and then applying it to u, one obtains
(e1∇e1)u = (u1,1 − u2,2) + e12(u2,1 + u1,2). (46)
10
Now all physical quantities can be described by the functions w, v and W , in which e1w and v
are left monogenic functions.
2.3.1.3 Clifford analysis method in C`0,2−1
Let us define the displacement
u = u1 + e2u2 ∈ C`0,2−1, (59)
Applying the Cauchy-Riemann operator D and its conjugate operator to u yields
Du = (u1,1 − u2,2) + e2(u2,1 + u1,2), (60)
Du = (u1,1 + u2,2) + e2(u2,1 − u1,2). (61)
Combining Eq.(17) and Eq.(18), one rewrites Eq.(60) and Eq.(61) as
Du =
1
2µ
(σ11 − σ22) + e12 1
µ
σ12, (62)
Du =
1
2(λ+ µ)
(σ11 + σ22) + e12(u2,1 − u1,2). (63)
Multiplying the α = 2 part of Eq.(20) by e2 and adding it to the α = 1 part of Eq.(20), one derives
1
2
D(σ11 + σ22 − 2ρV ) + 12D(σ11 − σ22 + e22σ12) = 0. (64)
On the basis of the above equation, one can assume there exists a potential function F which
satisfies
DF = σ11 + σ22 − 2ρV, (65)
DF = −(σ11 − σ22 + e122σ12). (66)
Then Eq.(64) can be rewritten as
1
2
D∇F − 1
2
D∇F = 0.
Comparing Eq.(62) with Eq.(66), one can find the relation between the potential function and dis-
placement, that is
Du = − 1
2µ
DF. (67)
It is straightforward to show
u = − 1
2µ
F + w (68)
satisfies Eq.(67), in which
Dw = 0. (69)
Applying the conjugate Cauchy-Riemann operator to Eq.(68) and substituting Eq.(65) into it, one
obtains
Du = − 1
2µ
(σ11 + σ22 − 2ρV ) +Dw. (70)
Since Eq.(63) is identical with Eq.(70), one has
Dw =
λ+ 2µ
2µ(λ+ µ)
(σ11 + σ22)− ρ2µV + e2(u2,1 − u1,2). (71)
12
It is straightforward to show
u =
1
2µ
F + w (83)
satisfies Eq.(spcl18), in which
(e1∇e1)w = 0. (84)
Applying the Dirac operator to Eq.(83) and substituting Eq.(80) into it, one obtains
∇u = 1
2µ
(σ11 + σ22 − 2ρV ) +∇w. (85)
Since Eq.(78) is identical with Eq.(85), one has
∇w = − λ+ 2µ
2µ(λ+ µ)
(σ11 + σ22) +
ρ
2µ
V + e12(u2,1 − u1,2). (86)
Adding the above equation to its conjugate and substituting Eq.(80) into it, one can deduce
∇F = −µ(λ+ µ)
λ+ 2µ
(∇w +∇w)− 2µ
λ+ 2µ
ρV (87)
If there exists a function W satisfying V = ∇W , the solution of Eq.(57) can be found as
F = −µ(λ+ µ)
λ+ 2µ
(w + x∇w)− 2µ
λ+ 2µ
ρW + v,
where x ∈ R0,2 and v is a left monogenic function, i.e.
∇v = 0. (88)
Now all physical quantities can be described by the functions w, v and W , in which e1w and v
are left monogenic functions.
2.3.2 Methods of displacement
2.3.2.1 Complex analysis method
In the last section, the methods of potential function have been introduced in complex analysis
and Clifford analysis. In this section, we address the methods of displacement.
On the basis of Eqs.(5), (29) and (30), Eq.(21) can be rewritten as follows:
(λ+ µ)
∂
∂x1

∂
∂z

u) + 4µ
∂
∂z¯
∂
∂z
u2 + ρb2 = 0. (90)
Multiplying Eq.(90) by i, adding it to Eq.(89) and assuming bi = ∂V∂xi , one obtains
2(λ+ µ)
∂
∂z¯
(

V = 0. (91)
This equation can be rewritten as
∂

w = 0, (92)
where
w := 2(λ+ µ)(
∂
∂z
u+
∂
∂z
u) + 4µ
∂
∂z
u+ ρV.
14
respectively. From the above equations we deduce
∇u = 1
2
λ+ 3µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
∇ψ − 1
2
λ+ µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
∇ψ − ρ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
V.
If the assumption of V = ∇φ is made, the displacement is
u =

2
λ+ 3µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
ψ − 1
4
λ+ µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
x∇ψ − ρ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
φ+ v,
where x ∈ R2 and the left monogenic function v satisfies
∇v = 0.
Now all physical quantities are described by the functions ψ, φ and the left monogenic function v.
2.3.2.3 Clifford analysis inC`0,2−1
On the basis of Eqs.(15), (59) and (60), Eq.(21) can be rewritten as follows:
1
2
(λ+ µ)
∂
∂x1
(Du+Du) + µDDu1 + ρb1 = 0, (99)
1
2
(λ+ µ)
∂
∂x2
(Du+Du) + µDDu2 + ρb2 = 0. (100)
Multiplying Eq.(100) by i, adding it to Eq.(99) and assuming bα = ∂V∂xα , we obtain
1
2
(λ+ µ)D(Du+Du) + µDDu+ ρb = 0. (101)
This equation can be rewritten as
Dw = 0 (102)
where the left monogenic function w is defined by
w :=
1
2
(λ+ µ)(Du+Du) + µDu+ ρV.
For Eq.(102) we assume there exists an analytic function ψ satisfying w = Dψ; hence,
Dψ =
1
2
(λ+ µ)(Du+Du) + µDu+ ρV. (103)
Adding and subtracting Eq.(103) to its conjugate, we obtain
Dψ +Dψ = (λ+ 2µ)(Du+Du) + 2ρV,
Dψ −Dψ = µ(Du−Du),
respectively. From the above equations we deduce
Du =
1
2
λ+ 3µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
Dψ − 1
2
λ+ µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
Dψ − ρ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
V.
If the assumption of V = Dφ is made, the displacement is
u =

2
λ+ 3µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
ψ − 1
4
λ+ µ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
xDψ − ρ
µ(λ+ 2µ)
φ+ v,
where x ∈ R⊕R0,1 and the function v satisfies
Dv = 0.
16
The equilibrium is
σij,i + ρbj = 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3. (111)
According to Eqs.(109), (110) and (111), we can derive the equilibrium equations of displacement
(Navier-Cauchy equation)
(λ+ µ)ui,ij + µuj,kk + ρbi = 0, i, j, k = 1, 2, 3. (112)
If the displacement is defined as
u = e1u1 + e2u2 + e3u3 ∈ C`3,0,
and we premutiply the i = 1 part, i = 2 part and i = 3 part of Eq.(112) by e1, e2 and e3, respectively,
and sum them up, we obtain
1
2
(λ+ µ)∇(∇u+∇u) + µ∇∇u+ ρb = 0. (113)
Comparing Eq.(113) with Eq.(96), we find that these two equations have the same forms but with
different dimensions. Hence, we follow the concept of Section 2.3.2.2 to deduce the solution of dis-
placement in three dimensional field
u =

where x ∈ C`3,0 and the left monogenic function v satisfies
∇v = 0.
2.5 Torsional problem
In Clifford analysis, the value f(x) of the Clifford valued function f at point x is a multivector and x
is a vector. For example, in a two-dimensional problem,
f : x = x1e1 + x2e2 → f(x) = f0(x) + e1f1(x) + e2f2(x) + e1e2f12(x),
where x1, x2, f0(x), f1(x), f2(x), f12(x) are all real valued. We illustrate the four real-valued functions
f0, f1, f2, f12 by the torsion problem in this section.
Consider a cylinder of length L subjected to a pair of couple M on its ends. Assume that no
body forces are present, and the cross sections warp according to
u3 = w(x1, x2).
w is called the warping function. It measures the warped deformation in the longitudinal direction x3
and is independent of x3.
Thus, the displacement field of the cylinder is
u1 = −αx2x3,
u2 = αx1x3,
u3 = w(x1, x2),
where α is the twist angle per unit length. By the strain-displacement relations, the strain components
are
ε11 = ε22 = ε33 = ε12 = 0,
ε13 =

Singular and hypersingular BIEs are established for any position y wherever located in the two-
dimensional space R2. We first derive the singular BIE in section 3.1.1 and then the hypersingular
BIE in the section 3.1.2.
3.1.1 Singular BIE
In two-dimensional Euclidean space R2, we consider an open, simply connected domain Ω ⊂ R2
bounded by boundary ∂Ω as shown in Fig.(1). There is an unknown scalar field variable u which
satisfies the Laplace equation, where the Laplace operator is defined as ∆ = ∂
2
∂x21
+ ∂
2
∂x22
. The so called
fundamental solution:
U(x− y) = 1
2pi
ln
1
|r|
satisfies
−∆U(x− y) = δ(x− y), ∀x, y ⊂ R2.
Here we let r = x− y be the vector from the source point y to the field point x and |r| = |x− y| is the
distance between the two points x and y. The fundamental solution U(x − y) exhibits singularity at
x = y due to the unit source at x = y represented by the Dirac delta function δ(x− y). Recall Green’s
second identity∫

Substituting f = U and g = u in the identity, one gets∫

dS(x), (116)
where ∂∂n(x) denotes a normal derivative and n(x) is the outward normal coordinate measured away
from the boundary point x. We also use n(x) to designate the outward unit normal vector at point x.
In Eq.(116)
∂U(x− y)
∂n(x)
=
−1
2pi
r · n(x)
|r|2 ,
where n in the left-hand side is the normal coordinate whereas n in the right-hand side is the normal
vector. The dot between two vectors denotes their inner product.
When y ∈ Ω, Eq.(116) can be rewritten as
u(y) =
∫
∂Ω
[
U(x− y)∂u(x)
∂n(x)
− u(x)∂U(x− y)
∂n(x)
]
dS(x). (117)
When y ∈ R2\Ω, where Ω := Ω ∪ ∂Ω and \ represents the region which we want to eliminate.
Eq.(116) can be rewritten as
0 =
∫
∂Ω
[
U(x− y)∂u(x)
∂n(x)
− u(x)∂U(x− y)
∂n(x)
]
dS(x). (118)
In the next step, we will see that if y ∈ ∂Ω then what form Eq.(116) will become. Let point
y be on the boundary ∂Ω, then Eq.(116) will yield singular terms. Therefore, we must invoke a
limiting process to account properly for the singularity of the fundamental solution, and, moreover,
the hypersingularity of the normal derivative of the fundamental solution. First, we need to temporarily
change the domain to Ω\B(y, ) as shown in Fig.(2). Thus the boundary may divide into two parts
∂Ω\B(y, ) and ∂B(y, ) ∩ Ω as shown in Fig.(3) and Fig.(4). We define B(y, ) := B(y, ) ∪ ∂B(y, ),
where B(y, ) is a circle with center y, radius , and boundary ∂B(y, ). When  tends to zero, Ω\B(y, )
and Ω are identical because both are open domains. That is lim
→0
Ω\B(y, ) = Ω. As a consequence their

We integrate a range from zero to a finite radius , and the above equation exists. Although  tends to
zero, the result is still a finite quantity. And we can use a similar step to discuss the Cauchy principal
value appearing later on.

3.1.2 Hypersingular BIE
In the previous section, we derived the singular BIE for the point y anywhere. In this section, we will
22
and expanding u(x), one gets
− lim
→0
{∫
∂Ω\B(y,)

.
By the same way, the above equation becomes
− lim
→0
[∫
∂Ω\B(y,)

]
. (123)
When  tends to zero, we find that the above equation still has an infinite term, although a limiting
process has been applied. Because the term are hypersingular, we need to do more. In order to raise
the order of the first term in the above equation, we change its kernel,
− lim
→0
[∫
∂Ω\B(y,)
[u(x)− u(y)] ∂
2U(x− y)
∂n(x)∂n(y)

. (124)
So it will exist if it satisfies the sense of Cauchy principal value, and go on to deal with the remainder
infinite term. Let the u(x) of the Eq.(122) be a constant function, have a quantity equal to one, one
gets
0 = − lim
→0
∫
∂Ω\B(y,)+∂B(y,)∩Ω
∂2U(x− y)
∂n(x)∂n(y)
dS(x).
Using the derivative result in the above, one easily obtains
lim
→0
∫
∂Ω\B(y,)
∂2U(x− y)
∂n(x)∂n(y)
dS(x) = − lim

.
Multiplying the u(y) to the above equation, and substituting into Eq.(124), one obtains
−
∫
−
∂Ω
[u(x)− u(y)] ∂
2U(x− y)

∂n(y)+
+
α

. (125)
So we can obtain the hypersingular BIE with the point y on the boundary
sinα

∂u(y)
∂n+(y)

∂Ω
[u(x)− u(y)] ∂
2U(x− y)
∂n(x)∂n(y)
dS(x).
Finally, we give a mention to the hypersingular BIE. The first square bracket of Eq.(123) is not a
finite term. So we use a symbol
∫
= to express its finite part, it is also called Hadamard principal value,
defined by∫

Substituting the kernel f = w(ζ)ζ−z into Eq.(126), where ζ = x1 + ix2, one gets

This is the Borel-Pompeiu formula [84] for z ∈ C\Ω. Also using the conjugate form of the Gauss
theorem, and letting f = ∂w(ζ)
∂ζ¯
ln |ζ − z|2, one obtains∫

2i
∫
∂Ω
∂w(ζ)
∂ζ¯
ln |ζ − z|2dζ¯,
where w(ζ) ∈ C1(Ω)∩C2(Ω). Inserting the above equation into Eq.(128) to replace the second integral
term, one obtains
0 =

ln |ζ − z|2dζ¯ +
∫
Ω
∂2w(ζ)
∂ζ¯∂ζ
ln |ζ − z|2dξdη.
But we should note that the w(ζ) ∈ C1(Ω) ∩ C2(Ω), which has some difference from the harmonic
function u(x) in the real variable BIE, so that we need to impose a restriction on the w(ζ), letting it
be a harmonic function. We discuss the third term of the right-hand side in the above equation, if
the w(ζ) is a harmonic function, then it satisfies ∂
2w(ζ)
∂ζ¯∂ζ
= 0 as we discussed before, and the integral
vanishes, yielding
0 =

2i
∫
∂Ω

∂ζ¯
ln |ζ − z|2dζ¯. (129)
Next we proceed to derive a BIE for z ∈ ∂Ω. For this aim, we temporarily change the domain
to Ω\B(z, ), and the boundary may be divided into two parts ∂Ω\B(z, ) and ∂B(z, ) ∩Ω as we did
in the previous section. We thus rewrite Eq.(129) as

∫
∂Ω\B(z,)+∂B(z,)∩Ω
∂w(ζ)
∂ζ¯
ln |ζ − z|2dζ¯. (130)
Now we will examine Eq.(130) term by term in the following. When  tends to zero, the first integral
term over ∂Ω\B(z, ) exists, and there are no singular terms, resulting in
lim
→0

Upon using the polar coordinates and expanding w(ζ), when  tends to zero, the first integral term
over ∂B(z, ) ∩ Ω becomes

which also exists and no singular terms come out. Once again, upon using the polar coordinates and

3.2.2 Hypersingular BIE from Borel-Pompeiu formula
In this section, we will derive the hypersingular Borel-Pompeiu formula. From Eq.(129), we take the
∂

0 =

But if z ∈ Ω, we need more process to discuss this problem. Let the domain Ω temporarily change to
Ω\B(z, ), and then the boundary is divided into two parts ∂Ω\B(z, ) and ∂B(z, )∩Ω as before. We
rewrite Eq.(131) as
0 =

Now we will examine Eq.(132) term by term in the following. When  tends to zero, the first integral
term over ∂Ω\B(z, ) exists, and there are no singular terms, yielding
lim

Upon using the polar coordinates and expanding w(ζ), when  tends to zero, the first integral term

From the above equations and let w = u + i0 and w = 0 + iv successively, we can obtain two
hypersingular BIEs in the same real variable forms as before, and, moreover, the complex valued
equation affords two more hypersingular BIEs which are acted upon by the tangent derivative in real
variable. In total we can get four hypersingular BIEs in the real variable forms from the complex

When y ∈ Ω, Eq.(135) can be rewritten as

∂Ω
U(x− y)n(x)∇f(x)dS(x).
When y ∈ Rn\Ω, where Ω := Ω ∪ ∂Ω. Eq.(135) can be rewritten as

∫
∂Ω
U(x− y)n(x)∇f(x)dS(x). (136)
In the next step, we will derive the boundary integral equation when y ∈ ∂Ω. We temporarily
change the domain to Ω\B(y, ) and the boundary may be divided into two parts ∂Ω\B(y, ) and
∂B(y, ) ∩ Ω. Then we rewrite the Eq.(136) as
0 =
∫
∂Ω\B(y,)+∂B(y,)∩Ω
E(x− y)n(x)f(x)dS(x)
+
∫
∂Ω\B(y,)+∂B(y,)∩Ω
U(x− y)n(x)∇f(x)dS(x), (137)
and we will examine it term by term. The first integral term can be written as
lim
→0
(∫
∂Ω\B(y,)
−
∫
∂B(y,)∩Ω
)
E(x− y)n(x)f(x)dS(x),
where the minus sign is because the n(x) on that boundary is opposite. The first term in the above
equation exists in the sense of Cauchy principal value; we use the symbol
∫− to represent the Cauchy
principal value of the integral. The second term is calculated as follows:
− lim
→0
∫

where ωin(y) is the surface area of the unit sphere S

The second integral term of Eq.(137) can be written as

(∫

−
∫
∂B(y,)∩Ω
)
U(x− y)n(x)∇f(x)dS(x).
The first term always exists, and there is no singular terms. For the one-dimensional case, the second
term is calculated as follows:
− lim
→0
∫
∂B(y,)∩Ω
1
2
|x− y| x− y|x− y|∇f(x)dS(x) = 0.
For the two-dimensional case, we get

ln |x− y| x− y|x− y|∇f(x)dS(x) = 0.

f(y) =

(139)
Comparing Eq.(138) and Eq.(139) and noting that the square of e2e1 is equal to i2 confirm that we
successfully prove their equivalence.
3.3.2.3 C`0,3
As in the previous steps, C`0,3 is now constructed in three-dimensional anti-Euclidean space R0,3, so it
should correspond to the three-dimensional BIE. Of course, we can find the BIE valued in R directly
from C`0,3. But, we deduce here the BIE valued in H from C`0,3, because H is only a special case
of C`0,n. C`0,n should have enough capability to represent. We start from the BIE of C`0,3 for the
boundary point y, one gets

−
∂Ω
E(x− y)n(x)f(x)dS(x) +

Substituting the three-dimensional fundamental solution, supposing the point y is at a corner on the
boundary, choosing n(x) = e1 to match the result that we obtained in C, one gets
ωi3(y)
4pi
f(y) =

From the result, we can find that quaternions are in the R4, but the vectors here are in the R3. So
we should use pure quaternions or reduced quaternions. In order to imitate C, we choose reduced
quaternions for correspondence.
3.3.3 Summary
We have successfully derived the Borel-Pompeiu formula in C`0,n, and transformed it to be a BIE
valued in C`0,n. Moreover, we have dealt with the singularity problem arising from locating the point
y on the boundary, smooth or nonsmooth.
In addition, we demonstrated that our derived n-dimensional BIE in C`even0,n indeed contains as
special cases one-dimensional BIE in R, two-dimensional BIE in C, three-dimensional BIE in Hr, and
36
where the minus sign is because the n(x) on that boundary is opposite. The first term in the above
equation exists in the sense of Cauchy principal value; we use the symbol
∫− to represent the Cauchy
principal value of the integral. The second term is calculated as follows:

3.4.2 Relations of BIEs
In this section we shall deduce the BIEs for one, two, three dimensional field variables with values
in C`1, C`2 and C`3. Taking their even parts, we can find the corresponding equations for R, C and
H-valued field variables, respectively.
3.4.2.1 C`1
C`1 is constructed in one-dimensional Euclidean spaceR1, so it should correspond to the one-dimensional
BIE. Let us see if it can deduce the BIE in R from C`1. We start from the BIE of C`1 for the boundary
point y,

f(y) =
∫
−E(x− y)n(x)f(x)dS(x)−

Substituting the three-dimensional fundamental solution, supposing the point y is at a corner on the
boundary. choosing the n(x) = e1 to match the result that we obtained in C, one gets

From the result, we can find that quaternions are is in R4, but the vectors here are in R3. So we should
use pure quaternions or reduced quaternions. In order to imitate C, we choose reduced quternions for
correspondence.
3.4.3 C`0,n, C`n and C`0,n−1
In Clifford analysis, we can easily transform between Rn → C`n, R0,n → C`0,n and R ⊕ R0,n−1 →
C`0,n−1. The three types of Clifford algebras and Clifford analysis are transformable as in the following
eIke
I
n = e
II
n e
II
k = e
III
k ,
− eInxI = eIInxII = xIII,
− eIn∇I = eIIn∇II = ∇III,
where the superscripts I, II, III represent the C`0,n, C`n, C`0,n−1, respectively.
Comparing C`0,n and C`n, we can see that the fundamental solutions for the Laplace operator
are the same in C`0,n and C`n. But the fundamental solutions for the Dirac operator are different in
C`0,n and C`n as
E(x− y) = 1
ωn
−(x− y)
|x− y|n
and
E(x− y) = 1
ωn
x− y
|x− y|n ,
respectively. Also the BIEs are different as
c(y)f(y) =
∫ (y)
∂Ω
E(x− y)n(x)f(x)dS(x) +
∫
∂Ω
U(x− y)n(x)∇f(x)dS(x)
and
c(y)f(y) =
∫ (y)
∂Ω
E(x− y)n(x)f(x)dS(x)−
∫
∂Ω
U(x− y)n(x)∇f(x)dS(x),
respectively. In fact, we can transform the fundamental solutions and equations from C`0,n to C`n
directly. So much as we may see the three types of Clifford analysis as one thing.
Finally, we should pay attention to the multiplication in Clifford algebras, which is not commu-
tative. So the multiplicators in left or right are different, and the operators are thus also clarified as
left and right.
