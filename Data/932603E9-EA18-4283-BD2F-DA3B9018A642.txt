limited success substantiating practical 
applications: 
(4) The majority of the analytical model for 
wetting front propagation has been based on a 
one-dimensional (1-D) assumption (Tan et al., 
2004), i.e., a subsurface flow in (or against) 
the direction of gravitation. Field monitoring 
and experimental results indicated that lateral 
(preferential) flows prevail in the hillslope 
(Anderson et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009; 
Huang and Yuin, 2010). Lateral flows in 
layered slope strata were observed in 
numerous studies (Weyman, 1973; Pilgrim et 
al., 1978; Weiler and Naef, 2003), but have 
rarely been considered in 
slope-stability-related analytical models.  
(5) The majority of the analytical model of 
slope stability was based on the assumption of 
infinite slope (Okimura and Ichikawa, 1985; 
Pradel and Raad, 1993; Rahardjo et al., 1995; 
Borga et al., 1998; Crosta, 1998; Enoki, 1999; 
Collins and Zndarcic, 2004; Kim et al., 2004; 
Meisina and Scarabelli, 2007; Lu and Godt, 
2008; Cho, 2009; Lee et al., 2009; Godt et al., 
2009; Montrasio et al., 2009) for which a 
phreatic line is parallel to the slope surface. 
However, numerous field studies have shown 
that shallow slopes consisting of colluvial 
deposits are often chair-shaped, i.e., a 
relatively gentle slope around the toe that 
forms a self-stabilizing mechanism (Lumb, 
1975; Johnson and Sitar, 1990; Jiao et al., 
2005; Gercovich et al., 2006; Lacerda, 2007; 
Cascini et al., 2008). Recent experimental 
evidence has shown the critical role of slope 
toe stability in seepage-caused slope failures 
and debris discharge (Orense et al., 2004; 
Chu-Agor et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2008; 
2009; Huang and Yuin, 2010). Analytical 
studies (Iverson and Major, 1986; Reid and 
Iverson, 1992) also indicated that seepage in 
hillslopes might introduce upward seepage 
force around the slope toe, causing static 
liquefaction, rather than shear failure, in that 
zone. A successful modeling of 
rainfall-induced slope failures should be able 
to address issues stated in (4) and (5) above. 
The present study creates a preliminary phase 
for a new finite shallow slope failure model 
with coupled hydraulic and mechanical 
analyses. The focus of this study is on the 
accuracy of subsurface hydrologic modeling 
and possible influence of the boundary 
condition change induced by progressive 
failures of the slope. 
 
MODELING SOIL-WATER 
CHARACTERISTICS CURVES 
  Figure 1 shows a cross section of the 
calibration box used for deriving the suction vs. 
water content relationships, namely the 
soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). Test 
specimens were prepared using a sandy soil 
identical to that discussed earlier. Sand 
specimens with specific water content w (= 0, 
5%, 10%, 17.5%, and 25%) were statically 
compacted with 50 mm-thick lifts to achieve 
targeted dry unit weights of d = 13.95, 14.26, 
14.74, and 15.17, 16 kN/m3 (or void ratios e = 
0.85, 0.809, 0.75, and 0.70, respectively). A 
tensiometer (Model 2725 and 5031-B.5, 
Soilmoisture Equipment Corp.) was placed at 
the center of the box and two soil moisture 
sensors (Model ECH2O-10, Decagon Devices, 
Inc.) were placed adjacent to the ceramic cup to 
measure the volumetric contents of the 
surrounding soils. These soil moisture sensors 
were calibrated prior to the test to ensure 
accurate water content measurements (Huang et 
al., 2008; 2009). To obtain the matric suction 
() vs. volumetric water content  (=   w / d; 
d: dry unit weight of sand, w: unit weight of 
water) relationships for various void ratios of 
sand, a specific amount of water (20 N) was 
uniformly spread across the top surface of the 
soil specimen. The box was then covered with a 
plastic sheet for a certain period of time (for 
about 90 min.) until a new equilibrium state of 
soil moisture for the entire soil box was 
reached. The matric suction and soil moisture 
outputs were recorded at equilibrium states. 
The use of 20 N of water for each step of 
water spreading was based on the result of 
trial-and-error tests. It was found that this 
amount of water generate detectable changes of 
volumetric water content of about 5% for each 
step of water spreading. Results of trial tests 
also showed that a smaller amount of water 
generated undetectable water content increase 
in the soil mass; a larger amount of water 
generated insufficient data points for the 
soil-water characteristic curve. A reversed

q: boundary flux  
mw: slope of  vs.  curve  
w: unit weight of water  
  In the present study, an isotropic condition, 
namely, kx = ky = ku(), was assumed. 
Although anisotropic conditions (kx  ky) have 
been used in some parametric studies (e.g., Ng 
and Shi, 1998), this assumption was not 
strongly supported by experimental and field 
evidences. In addition, Witt and Brauns (1983) 
investigated the permeability anisotropy due to 
flatness and orientation of particles. They 
showed theoretically and experimentally that a 
randomly packed flat particles with a ratio of 4 
(diameter):1 (thickness) was associated with 
kx/ky = 2.3. In view of the sub-rounded particle 
shape for the soil used in the present study, the 
permeability anisotropy is believed to be very 
small. The saturated permeability coefficients 
(ks) used here were obtained based on a 
standard test method ASTM D 2434. For the 
transient seepage analysis performed here, 
four-noded quadrilateral elements were used. A 
preliminary analysis of the wetting front 
propagation in a seepage box (to be discussed 
in the following section) showed a negligible 
advantage in using quadrilateral elements with 
more nodes. It is well-known that the accuracy 
of numerical calculations in time domain is 
ensured by using a small time increment. 
However, a too-small time increment entails 
unnecessarily long hour of calculations. To this 
end, a comparative study on the effectiveness 
of time intervals was conducted by using three 
time intervals (t), namely, 0.1 s, 1.0 s, and 5.0 
s in a preliminary seepage analysis. Analytical 
results show that a decrease of time interval 
from 1.0 s to 0.1 s caused negligible influence 
on the rate of wetting front propagation and 
time of wetting front arrival. Therefore, a time 
increment of 1.0 s was used in the following 
analysis. 
 
 
SEEPAGE ANALYSES USING FINITE 
ELEMENT METHOD 
  Figure 4 shows a cross section of the seepage 
test box and the locations of the soil moisture 
sensors. The soil specimen preparation method 
was identical to that used for the calibration 
box test described earlier. In this case constant 
water heads (h) of 10 mm or 50 mm were 
applied to the top surfaces of the soil specimens. 
Fig. 5(a) shows the measured and simulated 
soil water content responses at a depth of 0.2 m. 
Four soil moisture sensors were installed at 
each depth (0.2 m and 0.42 m), and they all 
provided similar experimental curves. The 
analytical curves of Green and Corey (1971) 
and Fredlund et al. (1994) provided better 
results than those of van Genuchten (1980). 
This is attributable to the fact that the PSF 
based on the SWCC of van Genuchten (1980) 
generally has lowest values of ku() among 
three PSF curves examined in Fig. 3. 
Note that none of them successfully simulated 
post-peak water content reduction behavior. 
This can be attributed to the fact that the 
analytical model was limited in that the 
air-phase flow was not modeled. To 
simultaneously simulate the water and air 
phases correctly, a rigorous approach such as 
that proposed by Fredlund and Rahardjo (1993) 
is necessary. Fig. 5(b) describes  vs. time 
relationships measured at the depth of 0.42 m 
for the test with e = 0.75 and h = 10 mm. It 
can be seen that the water content response at 
the depth of 0.42 m was simulated well using 
the SPF proposed by Fredlund et al. (1994). It 
can be seen in Fig. 5(b) that no post-peak 
reduction of  was observed at the depth of 
0.42 m, which is close to the base of the box. 
At this depth, the soil becomes ‘flooded’ or 
‘saturated’ immediately after the arrival of 
wetting front. This is different from the middle 
depth of 0.2 m, where trapped air bubbles 
existed. Based on the result of comparative 
study shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), SPFs of 
Fredlund et al. (1994) are used in the following 
analyses.
