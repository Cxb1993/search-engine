A new estimation technique to estimate the numerical error of the 
meshless methods for the boundary value problems of partial 
differential equations 
 
ABSTRACT 
In this report, we developed a systematic 
error estimation scheme to estimate the 
numerical error in the meshless methods without 
having an exact solution. The procedure of error 
estimation for three dimensions and for other 
types of differential equations follows as simple 
extensions with minor modifications. In this 
error estimation technique, an auxiliary problem 
is defined by substitutes for the real problem. 
The analytical solution of the auxiliary problem 
is generated by a Trefftz set. By solving the 
auxiliary problem and comparing the solution 
with the analytical solution, the error curve of 
the meshless methods versus shape parameter or 
the number of interpolate scattered points can be 
derived. Two selective examples are solved to 
demonstrate how to obtain the optimal parameter 
or the optimal number of points of the meshless 
methods.

  It is noted that the locations of source points 
(shape parameters) have important effect on the 
accuracy of the MFS. Because the fictitious 
boundaries involve the inner and outer 
boundaries out of domain, the off-boundary 
distances between the fictitious boundaries and 
the physical boundaries are not easily chosen. 
Furthermore, the factors of sources of numerical 
error come from not only the locations but also 
the number of source points on both the inner 
and outer fictitious boundaries. To overcome the 
above mentioned difficulty, an objective 
estimation technique to estimate the numerical 
error will be studied to derive the applicable 
region of off-boundary distances and number of 
source points.

shown in Table 1. The potential and its

collocation points, xi, on the Dirichlet boundary

two solvers of space is derived as:

where C is a bounded constant. 
 
3.2 Error analysis in the auxiliary 
problem 
The error norm of numerical solution of the 
auxiliary problem adopts the relative root mean 
squared (R.M.S.) error by comparing the 
numerical solution with the auxiliary solution 
which is defined as below:

where NF is the number of field points and 
 iF x  is the numerical solution of the auxiliary 
problem by BEM. Besides, the error norm can 
also be adopted by the relative error of rigidity 
as follows:

The flowchart of the formulation in 
implementing the new error estimation technique 
is shown in Fig. 1. Through the error 
convergence analysis in the auxiliary problem, 
we can obtain the error curve. Based on the 
specified criteria by the balance between 
computational cost and accuracy, we can obtain 
the optimal number of elements at the 
neighboring region of the corner in the error 
curve. 
3.3 Solving the original problem 
Adopting the optimal number of elements, 
the unknown boundary densities can be solved 
by collocating observation points to match the 
BCs in the original problem, and then the 
optimal solutions for the domain of interest of 
original problem can be calculated. 
 
4 Numerical examples 
To ensure the stability and validity of the new 
estimation technique in the Trefftz method and 
MFS for Helmholtz problem with 
multiply-connected domain subjected to the 
Dirichlet, two examples are given as: 
Example 1: Helmholtz problem with 
multiply-connected domain 
This problem subjected with Dirichlet B.C. is 
shown in Fig. 2, and the analytical solution is 
specified as: 
( )

u x y e

                   (23) 
The wave number, k, is given as π and R (the 
ratio of exterior boundary points to interior 
boundary points) is given as 1. After applying 
the error technique in the MFS for solving this 
problem, the R.M.S error versus d is plotted in 
Fig. 3(a)-(c) by distributing 50, 60 and 70 source 
points, respectively. By observing the error 
curves, the optimal parameter, ,optd  is obtained 
at the corner of the curves. To see the 
convergent analysis, Fig. 4 is plotted. A 
convergent result can be obtained after 
distributing over 70 points. The optimal 
parameter, ,optd versus number of source point, N,
