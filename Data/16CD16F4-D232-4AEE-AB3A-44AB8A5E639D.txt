ABSTRACT 
This study proposes a method which can generate high quality 
inverse halftone images from halftone images. This method 
can be employed prior to any signal processing over a halftone 
image or the inverse halftoning used in JBIG2. The proposed 
method utilizes the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm to 
establish a relationship between the current processing 
position and its corresponding neighboring positions in each 
type of halftone image, including Direct Binary Search (DBS), 
Error Diffusion (ED), Dot Diffusion (DD), and Ordered 
Dithering (OD). After which, a referenced region called a 
Support Region (SR) is used to extract features. The SR can be 
obtained by relabeling the LMS-trained filters with the order 
of importance. Moreover, the probability of black pixel 
occurrence is considered as a feature in this work. According 
to this feature, the probabilities of all possible grayscale values 
at the current processing position can be obtained by the 
Bayesian theorem. Consequently, the final output at this 
position is the grayscale value with the highest probability. 
Experimental results show that the proposed method offers 
better visual quality than that of Mese-Vaidyanathan’s and 
Chang et al.’s methods in terms of HPSNR (Human-visual 
Peak Signal to Noise Ratio). In addition, the memory 
consumption is also superior to Mese-Vaidyanathan’s method.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Digital halftoning [1]-[2] is a technique for converting 
continuous-tone images into limited-tone images. Halftone 
images resemble an original grayscale images when viewed 
from a distance, due to the low-pass filtering nature of the 
Human Visual System (HVS). The technique is used widely in 
computer print-outs, printed books, newspapers and magazines, 
as they are mostly constrained to black-and-white format (with 
and without ink). Another major application of digital 
halftoning is color quantization with a restricted color palette. 
Halftoning methods include Ordered Dithering (OD) [1], Dot 
Diffusion (DD) [3]-[4], Error Diffusion (ED) [5]-[16] and an 
iteration-based halftoning: Direct Binary Search (DBS) [17]-
[22]. 
Inverse halftoning is a conjugate technique to halftoning, 
which restores a halftone image with binary bit-depth to a 
continuous-tone image with multiple bit-depths. This 
technique can be employed for halftone image processing. For 
instance, inverse halftoning can be used in image rotation, 
intensity changing, or image size adjustment. These signal 
processes significantly decrease image quality, since the 
processed results may become in continuous-tone fashion as 
opposed to the desired halftone binary format. Thus, a halftone 
image is generally transformed to a grayscale image using 
inverse halftoning and then undergone those signal processing; 
the second round halftoning is applied to recover the halftone 
format after signal processing. In addition, inverse halftoning 
is also a part of the JBIG2 compression method. It is known 
that a binary image cannot achieve high compression ratio. 
Hence, inverse halftoning is employed in JBIG2 to obtain a 
grayscale image and then compressed for transmission. The 
decoder conducts the second round halftoning to recover the 
binary format for printing. In Chang-Yu’s study [23], the 
classification mechanism for different kinds of halftone 
images takes priority over the algorithm of inverse halftoning 
so as to increase the resulting quality of inverse halftone 
images. First, they tried transforming the halftone images into 
their Fourier spectrums in order to separate different halftone 
images. However, the complexity is inadmissible. Hence, the 
method was replaced by the cooperation between one-
dimensional correlation and a three-layer Back Propagation 
Neural (BPN) network. Mese-Vaidyanathan’s inverse 
halftoning [24] is a Look-Up Table (LUT) based method for 
all kinds of halftone images. The resulting images have clear 
edges and this method is computationally efficient. In addition, 
the memory consumption is based on the halftone value of 
possible combinations of all pixels in the referenced region. 
Consumption increases by L2 , where L denotes the referenced 
number of pixels on halftone images. Chang et al. [25] 
proposed a hybrid inverse halftoning technique. They 
employed the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) to train masks to 
obtain the grayscale value when an empty cell is encountered. 
After which, the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) was 
proposed for inverse halftoning, which also was a LUT-based 
method. This method offers excellent processing speed. In this 
work, the concept of Chang-Yu’s halftone image classification 
was adopted. Moreover, Bayesian theorem can provide a good 
classified result based on the known information. As 
documented in [26], the Bayesian can achieve an optimal 
classified result when appropriate features are employed. This 
work adopts the probability of black pixel occurrence as the 
feature to cooperate with the Bayesian theorem. The 
experimental results prove that good reconstructed image 
quality can be achieved. 
 The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 
2 describes the proposed inverse halftoning method in detail. 
Section 3 presents the performance and experimental results, 
and conclusions are drawn in Section 4. 
2. PROPOSED INVERSE HALFTONING BASED ON THE 
BAYESIAN THEOREM  
Figure 1 shows the proposed inverse halftoning algorithm. The 
objective of this algorithm is to transform halftone images (H) 
into inverse halftone images (IH). First, the halftoning 
technique ( iTech ) which yields H should be determined prior 
to inverse halftoning, because different halftoning schemes 
have various characteristics. Thus, the halftone image 
classification procedure is conducted in the first phase. Next, 
based on the prior knowledge of iTech , the optimized support 
region size (L) can be determined to offer the best image 
To obtain the feature (F), 153 natural training images of 
size 512x512 were employed. This set is different from the set 
used for the training support region in sub-section 2.1, but this 
set is also constructed from [27]’s database. First, select a 
halftoning technique iTech  and the corresponding ),( iTechLSR  
with limited support region size L. Mese-Vaidyanathan’s 
inverse halftoning [24] checks the combinations of black and 
white pixels in the support region with limited L to find the 
grayscale value of the current processing pixel. The memory 
consumption of this method increases by L2 , which means 
this method requires a lot of memory. To solve this problem, it 
is replaced by the probability of black pixel occurrence at each 
position in the support region. The memory consumption is 
thus reduced to LN
Rg
× , where variable 
Rg
N  denotes the 
number of Rg  in limited L. The probability is described as 
below,

where position ),(),( iTechLSRnm ∈ , and function )(⋅Num  
denotes the calculation of counts occurred for a given event. In 
the explanation of sub-section 2.1, 
Rg
N  cannot be 256 except 
for the cases when L is greater or equal to 255, and under 
common condition the L is further lower than 255, this makes 
the 
Rg
N  is also lower than 256 with the relationship of Fig. 4. 
According to this, in the procedure of statistical probability 
construction as Eq. (6), the 
jiori ,  only needs to take Rg  into 
consideration since others cannot be represented under this 
limitation on support region size L. This strategy can 
significantly reduce the memory consumption.  
 
2.3 Inverse halftoning technique based on the Bayesian 
theorem 
The performance of inverse halftoning techniques are 
determined by the degree of similarity between original image 
(Ori) and inverse halftone image (IH) obtained with limited 
information. The Bayesian theorem is a fundamental 
probabilistic approach to the problem of classification, which 
can obtain an optimum decision based on all known 
probabilistic features. Based on these features, the probability 
of the various grayscale values at the position currently being 
processed can be determined. The conditional probability is 
described as follows:

rewritten as follows:

qg  with respect to these features 
110 ,,, −Lhhh  , and ),,,( 110 −Lhhhp   is called the evidence. The 
memory consumption of the numerator is LgRN 2× , where the 
)( qgp  is assumed as an uniform distribution RgN/1  in this 
study, and the other parts are used for searching the mapping 
probability of )|,,,( 110 qL ghhhp − . Normally, the 
distribution )( qgp  for a well exposed image should be 
Gaussian, However, in our experience, not all of the natural 
images are well exposed candidates. Herein, 1000 common 
natural images [27], including the 153 training and the 202 
testing images used in this work, are employed for generating 
the corresponding distribution. As it can be seen from Fig. 5, 
the result is close to the uniform distribution as we suggested. 
Thus, without losing generality by simply using the Gaussian 
distribution for ideal exposed images, the uniform distribution 
is employed to better characterize the property of the most 
digital images. To simplify the implementation, the above 
equation is rewritten as follows to let all features be 
independent. The independent assumption is from the Naïve 
Bayes classifier, which has been proven that it still can 
maintain excellent performance from Zhang’s research [26].

As for the evidence, it is probably changed when H is different

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section we apply the proposed Bayesian-based inverse 
halftoning for quantitative evaluation. A comparison of the 
memory consumption of the proposed method with that of 
Mese-Vaidyanathan’s inverse halftoning [24] is shown in Fig. 
6. This figure represents the amount of required memory at the 
size L of different support regions. The vertical axis of Fig. 
6(a) is compressed by log function since we can observe that 
the memory consumption of Mese-Vaidyanathan’s method is 
increased by power law. The range of different support region 
sizes from 1 to 6 is shown in Fig. 6(b). The memory 
consumption of Mese-Vaidyanathan’s method is superior to 
the proposed method that ranges from 1 to 4. However, it 
cannot provide better inverse halftone image quality for 
different halftoning techniques with support region size as 
small as 4. 
 For image quality assessment, The traditional PSNR 
indeed is not suited for characterizing the response of human 
vision, since the distortions (MSE) between the original image 
and a reconstructed image is calculated pixel-wised. Normally, 
when we perceive an image, the information of the 
neighboring pixels is included. Thus, we modify the definition 
of PSNR to Human-visual Peak Signal to Noise Ratio 
(HPSNR) to better characterize the response of the human 
visual system. Suppose the image is of size PxQ, and the 
quality is defined as

where the variable 
nmcoe ,  is employed for representing the 
low-pass characteristic of HVS. In this study, 
nmcoe ,  is 
obtained by the following 2-D Gaussian Filter (GF) of size 
the single feature in this work. More effective features are left 
for future exploration to further improve image quality.  
Although the proposed scheme can provide superior 
image quality for those natural images in terms of HPSNR, the 
proposed method seems render inferior quality to that of 
Mese-Vaidyanathan’s method in those “special cases (details)”. 
We admit which can be a weakness of the proposed scheme. 
Yet, when it comes to a normal natural image, we found that 
most of the components in an image are rather smooth with 
low frequency textures. Thus, the proposed method mostly can 
generate a good image quality with natural images in terms of 
HPSNR, and consequently it can be considered as a good 
candidate for most applications which requires inverse 
halftoning. Future possible working directions can be put to 
develop a hybrid method, such as combining Mese-
Vaidyanathan’s work and the proposed method, to fully take 
care of all the possible components, smooth or detail, in an 
image.

郭景明 
國立台灣科技大學電機系教授 
會議時間地點 2010年 5月 30~6月 2日，地點:法國巴黎 
會議名稱 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems 
發表論文題目 
1. J. M. Guo* and Y. F. Liu, “Improved Block Truncation Coding Using 
Optimized Dot Diffusion,” IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and 
Systems, Paris, France, May 30-June 2, 2010.

一、參加會議經過 
ISCAS 是電路及系統方面辦得相當不錯的研討會，且本研討會提供了非常多相關的
交流技術平台。本次參加研究會除了參與本身發表論文的兩個場次外，也參加了許多其
他個人有興趣的主題，除了吸收最新發展技術外，也結識許多國際上知名的學者，對於
未來的國際合作奠立了基礎，並且也藉由參與本研討會讓國際上的學者瞭解台灣在這方
面的技術發展，也間接提升少許的國際知名度。 
 
二、與會心得 
本次會議除了發表本計畫衍生的成果， 聽取國際上相關的研究作品，也結識了幾位
國際上在半色調方便作得相當不錯的學者，例如:香港的 Oscar Au 教授, 新加坡的 Alex 
Kot教授,及美國 Gaurav Sharma教授等，其中也與 Prof. Sharma談到未來合作的可能性，
回國後也紛紛收到這幾位教授來信邀請審查國際上知名的期刊論文，如 IEEE Transactions 
on Image Processing及 IEEE Transaction on Information Forensics and Security，在審查的過
程又意外獲得了許多新的靈感，這連串在學術上的收穫如果沒有參加這次研討會，相信
機會是不多了。大體而言，這次的研討會參與相當重要，不僅瞭解國際上的學者在這個
議題上的態度與發展，也得到了不少新的啟發。 
 
本次個人所發表之論文摘要分別如下:
