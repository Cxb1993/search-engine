2.  THEORETICAL BASIS  
The energy-dissipation method involves the balance 
between the energy dissipated by the friction force of a 
real system against the energy input to the system.  This 
balance results in the “equivalent viscous and Coulomb 
friction” parameters, similar to the traditional “equivalent 
viscous damping” concept presented in undergraduate 
textbook such as [16].  To explain the idea, let’s 
consider a single DOF damped-forced oscillator with the 
following equation of motion 
)(),( taxxFkxxm =++ &&& ,          (1) 
where m is the mass, k represents the stiffness, x is the 
displacement, dots indicate derivatives with respect to 
time, and  represents the excitation.  In addition, 
 denotes the damping force occurring at the 
contact interfaces. Multiplying Eq. (1) by dx and 
integrating the resultant equation along the motion path 
C results in the following equation 
)(ta
),( xxF &
∫∫ =++ CC dxtadxxxFkxdxdxxm )()},({ &&& .   
To facilitate the implementation of integration, the 
integration variable can be changed to time.  Hence 
∫ + =++1 )()},({Ttt Ttt dtxtadtxxxFkxxm &&&&& ∫ + 1   
where  denotes a finite time interval.  Now, if the 
following expressions are defined 
1T
∫ += 1 ),(Tttd dtxxxFW && ; ;
, 
∫ += 1 )(Ttta dtxtaW &
∫ + += 1 }{Ttte dtxkxxmW &&&
Eq. (1) becomes 
ead WWW −=    (2) 
Equation (2) implies a balance among the dissipated, 
applied energy and the sum of kinetic and elastic energy.  
To implement the damping identification, we assume that 
x(t) (and its derivatives) and a(t) can be measured.  
Then, the terms involved in Eq. (2) are quantified while 
 is expressed using an assumed friction model 
with unknown parameters. By integrating and balancing 
Eq. (2), one acquires identification equations for the 
damping parameters.   
),( xxF &
When a(t) and x(t) are periodic, one can integrate Eq. 
(2) over a full cycle of periodic motion.  In that case, the 
contribution of the conservative components of the 
oscillator “ ” is zero, so that the following 
energy-dissipation equation can be obtained

here T represents the fundamental period of the response.  
To further illustrate the idea, we assume that  is 
modeled by “viscous plus Coulomb friction” while a 
harmonic base excitation is adopted for .

Here, and  are the equivalent damping 
parameters to be identified.  Eq. (4) can be used to 
estimate  and  using two excitation levels.  
Alternatively, more excitation levels can be applied to 
gain multiple versions of Eq. (4). In the latter case, the 
number of equations is more than the number of 
unknown parameters, thus, the least-squares criterion can 
be applied to improve the robustness of the method.

The algorithms outlined above are suitable for the 
single DOF vibration system.  A study focusing the 
single DOF systems subjected to periodic input (and 
response) has been presented in [10] in which the 
effectiveness and reliability of the method were 
demonstrated.  The method is not only valid for the 
periodic case but also applicable in the general-input or 
input-free case, for which  becomes an arbitrary time 
interval rather than a complete forcing period. It is worth 
to note that in the input-free case, vanishes in Eq. 
(2).  Therefore, initial states of the system should be 
large enough to introduce sufficient free responses.  
Damping parameters can then be estimated from these 
free-vibration data.

The basic concepts and procedures used in the single 
DOF case can be extended to handle multiple DOF 
problems.  To show how the extension can be 
accomplished, the following equation of motion of a 
multi-DOF system is considered

vector.   represents a vector of elements  
such that  models the Coulomb components 
locating at certain positions of the discrete model of the 
system.  To that end,  is a matrix 
comprising of sign functions of relative velocities 
occurring at contact interfaces.  Since, generally, not 
every damping components of vectors c  and  are

. APPLICATION OF THE METHOD TO 
SIMULATION DATA  
Two numerical systems with known parameter values 
are selected to validate the proposed schemes.  Both the 
periodic and general input cases are studied.  In 
implementing the method, the differential equations of 
motion are first formulated in a matrix form similar to 
that of Eq. (5).  A stiff, low-order ordinary differential 
equation (ODE) solver of Bogacki and Shampire 
(ode23tb) was then adopted to numerically integrate the 
ODEs of the numerical systems at a constant sampling 
rate after converting the ODEs to first-order form [17].  
Simpson’s rule was adopted to integrate ijτ , ijγ , and iβ  
in accordance with the contexts shown in Eqs. (10)-(12) 
or (10), (11) and (12a) depending on the excitation.  
 
3.1 Numerical study of a 2-DOF system  
A two-DOF vibration system, whose schematic 
diagram is presented in Figure 1, is first explored.  
According to Figure 1 and the contexts of Eq. (5), the

Note that both of the differential equations appearing 
in Eq. (14) are of second order. Therefore, theoretically, 
each of these equations can be used to solve for two 
unknown parameters provided that persistent excitation 
conditions are satisfied [18].  The maximal number of 
unknowns that can be estimated in this example is four, 
which equates the number of un-identified parameters.  
To that end, one can choose to excite the system with two 
different levels while both of the differential equations of 
(14) are adopted. 
Alternatively, one can also choose to use both ODEs 
of Eq. (14) with more excitation levels so that more than 
four algebraic equations are obtained.  In that case, 
more robust estimations can be gained through the 
application of the least-squares criterion. The latter 
approach will be adopted here which leads to the 
following

The procedures taken in the previous 2-DOF case 
were applied here.  It should be emphasized that two 
excitation levels, separately corresponding to 5 Hz and 
10 Hz, were adopted in this example.  The approach 
differed from the 2-DOF case where the system was 
excited at one single frequency and three different levels.  
Forcing the system at two different frequencies, both 
near resonance, could improve the estimation a bit.  For 
instance, the estimates obtained using the 
mixed-frequency excitation were: 04.20~*11 =c , 
05.20~ *12 =c , 19.20~*23 =c , 09.20~*33 =c , 01.1~ =kF . 
 
Figure 4 Three-DOF system with friction link between 
mass 3 and ground. 
The mean of absolute values of the normalized residuals 
was 7.94e-4, for numerically integrated noise-free 
numerical data with a perfect model.  The MSE values 
associated with the simulated and estimated acceleration 
signals were: %0012.01 =MSE , , %0013.02 =MSE
%0013.03 =MSE .  The effectiveness of the proposed 
method is again verified by the low values of MSE and 
the small mean of the normalized absolute residuals.. 
In contrast, if two excitation levels, 1000 =F  and 
200, corresponding to the same frequency, 10=ω Hz, 
were applied, the resultant estimates turned out to be: 
26.19~*11 =c , 16.18~*12 =c , 41.23~*23 =c , 80.20~*33 =c , 
015.1~ =kF , while the mean of the absolute residuals was 
9.49e-5.  The corresponding MSE values obtained based 
on these estimates were: , %0038.01 =MSE
%0014.02 =MSE , %0029.03 =MSE .  Obviously, the 
estimation accuracies obtained from the mixed-frequency 
case are better (especially the viscous damping estimate) 
than that of the single-frequency case. Although the latter 
ones are also acceptable which could be verified by the 
low MSE values associated with the estimates.  Our 
speculation is that forcing the system with more than one 
frequency, near resonance, might excite richer responses 
that contains more information regarding the system’s 
characteristics, including damping.  Thus, better 
estimates can be gained from these rich responses, 
although a thorough investigation might be required to 
conclude the statement. 
Similar to the 2-DOF case, we then added to the 
simulated force input, velocity and displacement 
responses a white random noise of 5% of their individual 
root-mean-squares values.  The excitation conditions 
were the same as those of the clean-data and 
mixed-frequency excitation case.  The estimates
