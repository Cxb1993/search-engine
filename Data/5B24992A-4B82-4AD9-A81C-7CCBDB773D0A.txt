Figure. 2. XRD patterns of deposited BaTiO3 thin films 
on the ITO/glass and Pt substrates. 
 
The crystal orientation and preferred phase of 
different substrates are important factors for ferroelectric 
thin films of MIM structures. The XRD patterns of 
BaTiO3 thin films with 40% oxygen concentration on 
Pt/Si substrates from our previous study are shown in Fig. 
3. The (111) and (011) peaks of the BaTiO3 thin films on 
Pt/Si substrates can be compared with those on ITO 
substrates. The strongest and sharpest peak was observed 
along the Pt(111) crystal plane. This suggests that the 
BaTiO3 films grew epitaxially with the Pt(111) bottom 
electrode. However, the (111) peaks of BaTiO3 thin films 
were not observed for (400) and (440) ITO substrates. 
Therefore, we determined that the crystallinity and 
deposition rate of BZ1T9 thin films on ITO substrates 
differed from those in this study.

BaTiO3 thin films. 
 
Leng et al. reported that rf-sputtered BaSrTiO3 
films grown on ITO substrates show better saturated P-E 
hysteresis and a high dielectric constant. Additionally, we 
observed that the remanent polarization of BaTiO3 thin 
films improves with post-treatment processes, such as 
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) and conventional furnace 
annealing (CFA). For a high substrate temperature, the 
remanent polarization of BZ1T9 thin films increases from 
5 to 7 μC/cm2. For this reason, we consider that the 
structure and grain size improved during the 
post-treatment process at high temperature.  
 
Figure 4 shows the capacitance-voltage (C-V) curves 
of BaTiO3 films as-deposited and annealed at 800 0C in 
air atmosphere for 1h by conventional furnace annealing 
(CFA). After CFA process, memory window of MFIS 
structure decreased from 3V to 1V, and threshold voltage 
decreased from 6V to 3V. It also demonstrated that the 
capacitance and grain size, observed from the SEM 
morphology, of annealed BaTiO3 films increased. The 
leakage current density-electrical field (J-E) curves of 
films as-deposited and annealed at 800 0C were shown in 
Fig. 5.

To analyze that this phenomenon of oxygen 
vacancies increases with the increase of annealing 
temperatures, the Schottky emission transport and 
Poole-Frenkel transport models can be used to discuss the 
mechanism. Figure 5 shows the lnJ-E1/2 curves of 
as-deposited BaTiO3 films under CFA annealing process. 
From the fitting experimental results shown in Fig. 5, the 
BaTiO3 films exhibit the Schottky emission transport

Figure 10 shows the P-E curves of BaTiO3 films 
observed at the frequency of 103 Hz and applied peak 
voltage of 8 V as time elapsed for 300 and 1800 seconds 
from the Sawyer-Tower circuits, respectively. After 1800 
second elapsed, the fatigue and imprint effect could be 
found. The coercive field decreased from 25 to 10 kV/cm, 
and the remnant polarization decreased from 1 to 0.5 
μC/cm2.

elapsed. 
 
Figure 11 shows the retention ability and remnant 
polarization of BaTiO3 films under different switching 
cycles. The remnant polarization decreased from 5 to 0.5 
μC/cm2 after 106 switching cycles. The dotted-line in the 
figure is prognosticated. Figure 11 shows the saturation 
polarization and coercive field of BaTiO3 films under 
different frequency of 102~106 Hz. The saturation 
polarization decreased from 8 to 4 μC/cm2 and coercive 
field decreased from 60 to 10 kV/cm as the frequency 
increased from 102 to 104 Hz, respectively. However, as 
the frequency increased from 102 to 104 Hz, the 
saturation polarization and coercive field of BaTiO3 films 
increased to 10 μC/cm2 and 30 kV/cm, respectively. 
From the results and description in above, the 
phenomenon that fatigue effect existed would be 
attributed to the correlation between space charge, defect 
and dipole of BaTiO3 films under different frequency 
between 102 and 106 Hz.

Figure. 12. Transmittance of BaTiO3 thin films as a 
function of oxygen concentration. 
 
Figure 12 shows the transmittance of BaTiO3 thin 
films within the UV-vis spectrum in the wavelength 
range of 300–1100 nm at different oxygen concentrations. 
The transmittance in the visible range, 400-700 nm, of 
as-deposited BaTiO3 thin films was determined, and the 
maximum transparency range was 92.8-97.8%. As the 
oxygen concentration increases, the maximum 
transparency value of the 40% oxygen as-deposited 
BaTiO3 thin films increases. However, the transparency 
of as-deposited BaTiO3 thin films of 60% oxygen 
concentration slightly decreases upon sputtering. In the 
infrared range, 700–1100 nm, the maximum transparency 
increases with increasing oxygen concentration. Figure 
12 also shows that the interference spectra and refractive 
index of thin films change for different oxygen 
concentrations. The high transparency of the BaTiO3 thin 
films should be developed for applications in SOP 
devices.
