Abstract 
 
This project is based on NSC 93-2213- E-230-017. 
In this project, we consider a certain class of 
two-level problems whose lower problem is 
generated by vector equilibrium problem. In my 
knowledge this kind of problems contain a lot of 
class for decision framework, such as 
optimization problems, variational inequality 
problems (VIP), saddle point problems and game 
theory problems, etc.. Based on the theorem of 
KKM, the semicontinuity of set-valued mapping, 
and the convexity properties of vector-valued 
mapping, we establish the existence of 
parametric vector equilibrium problems (PVEP in 
short) and its corresponding MPEC problems and 
the closed properties of solution mapping for 
PVEP. 
Keywords: Two-level problems, variational 
inequality problems, equilibrium problems, 
MPEC problems, game theory problems, KKM 
theorem. 
 
??????? 
Two-level decision problems, coupled with an 
increasing, powerful computational procedures, 
are new topics and play an important role in 
decision problems, including the engineering and 
experimental natural science, regional planning, 
management, and economics problems (e.g., see 
[6-9] or [11-13].). Based on the theory of two-level 
problems, hierarchical decision-making problems 
or multilevel programming problems will be easy 
to extend, so the two-level framework is more 
important. 
In this project, we first analyze the 
parametric vector equilibrium problem with 
variable domination structure then we shall 
study a two-level problem whose lower-level 
problem was generated by the parametric vector 
equilibrium problem based on what we obtain in 
previous. Sometimes we call this kind of 
two-level problem the generalized two-level

C-quasiconvex on K if it satisfies one of the following 
two equivalent conditions: 
(i) for each  and , 
 
where  is the set of upper bounds of 
, that is 
 
(ii) for each z , the level set 
 
is convex or empty. 
Remark 1. First statement is defined by Luc [11] 
and the second is by Ferro [3]. Some readers 
recall the following Helbig’s definition which is 
stronger than Luc and Ferro’s definition. When Z 
is locally convex space and C is closed, the 
definition is equivalent to C-naturally 
quasiconvex defined by Tanaka [14]. 
Definition 2 (see [3, 14]). Let X be a vector space, 
and Z also a locally convex space with a partial 
ordering defined by a closed pointed convex cone C. 
Suppose that K is a convex subset of X and that f is a 
vector-valued function from K to Z. Then, f is said to 
be (Helbig’s) C-quasiconvex on K if for every 
 and , and each'  
 
where  stands for the topological dual cone of C. 
Definition 3 (see [10, 15]) Let X be a topological 
space, and Z a topological vector space with a partial 
ordering defined by a solid pointed convex cone C. 
Suppose that f is a vector-valued function from X to Z. 
Then, f is said to be C-continuous at x  if it 
satisfies one of the following three equivalent 
conditions: 
(i)  is open. 
(ii) For any neighborhood  of f(x), there 
exists a neighborhood  of x such that 
 for all . 
(iii) For any , there exists a neighborhood 
 of x such that  for all 
. 
Moreover a vector-valued function f is said to be 
C-continuous on X if f is C-continuous at every x on 
X. 
Remark 2. C-continuity and (-C)-continuity are 
the same as ordinary lower and upper 
semicontinuity, respectively, whenever  
and . In [15, Definition 2.1 (pp.314–315)] 
corresponding to ordinary functions, 
C-continuous function is called C-lower 
semicontinuous function, and (-C)-continuous 
function is called C-upper semicontinuous 
function. 
Definition 4 (see [2]). Let X and Y be two 
topological spaces, T :  a set-valued mapping. 
Then T is said to be lower semicontinuous (l.s.c. for 
short) at  if for each open set V with 
, there is an open set U containing x such 
that for each  T is said to be l.s.c. 
on X if it is l.s.c. at all . 
Definition 5 (parameterized cone-continuity). Let 
P be a topological space. Let X and Z be two t.v.s.. 
Suppose that C is a set-valued mapping from P to  
such that C has solid convex cone values, and suppose 
that K is a set-valued mapping from P to . 
Then the vector-valued function f :  
is said to be parameterized C-continuous on 
 with respect to K, if for each  and 
 such that 
 
there exists a neighborhood U of (p, x) such that for all 
 
 
Definition 6 (joint -C(p)-continuity). A function g : 
 is said to be jointly 
-C(p)-continuous if for each , 
a neighborhood  of , and a neighborhood  of 
, there exist , , and  such 
 6 
by (1). Also we assume the following conditions: 
(i)  is a closed set; 
(ii)  has closed graph; 
(iii) g is parameterized (-C)-continuous on  
with respect to ; 
(iv)  is C(x)-quasiconvex on  for each 
, and  for 
each ; 
(v) for each  there exist  and a 
compact set  such that  and 
 
Then the problem (PVEP) has at least one solution, 
and SE has closed graph. 
As an application of closeness result of solutions 
map for PVEP above, we investigate the existence 
of solution for a MPEC problem as follows: 
 
where  is a real-valued 
functional and  is a set-valued 
mapping such that for each ;  is the 
solution set of the following PVEP, defined by 
equation (1). 
Theorem 4. Let  and  be two nonempty 
subsets of X and Y , respectively. Let C be a set-valued 
mapping from  to , such that C has solid poited 
convex cone values. Suppose that  is a set-valued 
mapping from  to , that g is a 
vector-valued function from  to Z, and 
that S is a set-valued mapping from  to  
defined by (1), and suppose that f is a vector-valued 
function from  to . Also we 
assume the following conditions: 
(i) f is lower semicontinuous on ; 
(ii)  and  are two compact sets; 
(iii)  is has closed graph; 
(iv) g is parameterized (-C)-continuous on  
with respect to ; 
(v)  is C(x)-quasiconvex on  for each 
,and  for 
each . 
Then the problem (MPEC) has at least one solution. 
The variable domination structure for PVEP 
is very important since each decision maker in 
group decision problems has his own preference.
