In order to build a finger-alike tendon-driven 
articulated manipulator, the model has to be compatible 
with the anatomical structure of a human finger and also 
has to abide the constitution of a tendon-driven system. 
Lee and Tsai [7] used graph theory and coaxial 
condition for the kinematic analysis of tendon-driven 
system. Later, Lee and Tsai [8] proposed a systematic 
methodology for the synthesis of manipulators with n 
DOFs and n+1 tendons. In the system, the radius of all 
pulleys on the same joint are assumed identical and this 
restricted the application of the manipulators. Ou and 
Tsai [9] suggested that, in an articulated tendon-driven 
manipulator, all tendons were in tension, no elongation 
of tendons was allowed, no slipping between tendons 
and pulleys and all links are rigid. Based on these 
assumptions, they proved that n+1 or 2n tendons were 
required for an n-DOF manipulator. Also, Ou and Tsai 
[9] further removed the restriction on the pulley sizes of 
a same joint. They allowed pulley sizes on the same axis 
to be different. Tsai [10] pointed out that the pseudo-
triangular structure matrix of a tendon-driven 
manipulator must satisfy: the rank of the structure 
matrix is greater or equal to the DOF of the system; the 
signs of elements in a row vector have to be at least 
changed once; the positions of non-zero elements have 
to be consecutive; elements in the null space vectors of 
structure matrix have to be all positive or all negative. 
Chen and Su [11] used QR factorization to decompose a 
matrix into an equivalent structure matrix, allowing 
non-pseudo-triangular matrix to be used as a structure 
matrix. 
This work starts from the finger anatomy and 
kinesiology to obtain the structure matrix of a tendon-
driven manipulator. Necessary assumptions regarding 
the relative motion between adjacent phalanges is 
suggested. The effect of the web-like expansion hood in 
the extensor mechanism of a human finger is disclosed. 
The equivalence between the finger tendons which are 
slipped inside sheaths and attached to the phalange via 
ligaments and the tendon-pulley system of a man-made 
manipulator is accomplished. Followed by the 
determination of the radius of the pulley sizes, the 
established kinematic model of a finger-alike, tendon-
driven, articulated manipulator for extension and flexion 
will be justified by the experimental data from other 
studies [12, 13]. Finally, synthesis of an isotropic finger-
alike, tendon-driven, articulate manipulator is 
accomplished. 
2  Anatomical Structure of a Human Finger 
A human finger possesses six tendons: one 
extensor is for extension; three flexors are for flexion 
and one abductor and one adductor on either side of a 
finger is, respectively, for abduction and adduction [13]. 
The muscles used to drive the extensor and flexors are 
on the human arm, while the muscles used to actuate the 
abductor and adductor are on the palm. Since one end of 
each tendon is attached to a phalange and the other end 
is connected to a muscle, a human finger is a base-
actuated, tendon-driven, articulate manipulator. 
Referring to the anatomical structure of a human 
finger as shown in Fig. 1 [14], a finger is constituted of 
three phalanges: distal, middle and proximal phalange, 
where proximal phalange is connected to a metacarpal 
bone. Ligaments are located between phalanges to 
connect heads and bases of phalanges and to hold 
tendons and sheaths onto the joints of a finger. Sheaths 
are held by ligaments and tendons are slipped inside the 
sheaths. Extensor digitorum communis (EDC) is an 
extensor which is routed through metacarpophalangeal 
joint (MCP), proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) and 
distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) to be attached to the 
dorsal of the distal phalange. Flexor digitorum 
profundus (FDP) is a flexor which is routed through 
MCP, PIP and DIP to connect to the palmar of the distal 
phalange. Flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) is a 
flexor which is routed through MCP and PIP and 
connects to the palmar of the middle phalange. 
Lumbricals (LU) is also a flexor which is routed 
through MCP and attaches to the proximal phalange. 
Interosseous (INs), routed through both sides of MCP 
and connected to the expansion hood, are abductor and 
adductor for the abduction and adduction of a finger.

The First IFToMM Asian Conference on Mechanism and Machine Science 
October 21 - 25, 2010, Taipei, Taiwan 
4. Characteristics of a Finger-Alike Tendon-Driven 
Manipulator 
According to Eq. (2), it is observed that, for a 
positive displacement of tendon 1 (EDC), joints of MCP, 
PIP and DIP are in extension, while for a positive 
displacement of tendon 2 (FDP), tendon 3 (FDS) or 
tendon 4 (LU), their associated joints of MCP, PIP and 
DIP is in flexion. Hence, the first characteristics of a 
finger-alike tendon-driven manipulator can be depicted 
as:  
C1. Each tendon only induces joints to move in 
one direction, where tendon 1 (EDC) is for extension 
and tendon 2 (FDP), tendon 3 (FDS) are tendon 4 (LU) 
are for flexion.  
Tendon forces and the joint torques of a tendon-
driven articulated manipulator can be related by the 
structure matrix A as 
=τ Aξ                                                                           (5) 
where column matrix ξ =[ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 , ξ4]
T stands for 
tendon forces and column matrix τ =[τMCP ,τPIP ,τDIP]
T 
represents joint torques. The radius of pulleys in the 
structure matrix is the moment arm of a tendon force. 
Since structure matrix A is not a square matrix, the 
tendon force ξ can be obtained as 
λ+= + Aξ A τ H                                                     (6) 
where A+=AT(AAT)-1 is the pseudo-inverse matrix of A, 
column matrix HA =[h1, h2, h3, h4]
T is a column matrix 
formed by the null space vector of matrix A, and λis an 
arbitrary value.   
The first term on the right hand side of Eq.(6) is the 
particular solution for the tendon forces, whose values 
depend on the given joint torques τ. The second term on 
the right hand side of Eq. (6) is the homogeneous 
solution for the tendon forces. All tendon forces from 
homogeneous solution result in the balance of all joint 
torques, i.e., zero joint torque due to the cancellation of 
all tendon forces. Since a tendon can only sustain 
tension, any negative tendon forces due to A+τ have to 
be compensated byλHA in order to get positive forces 
for ξ. Therefore, all elements in column matrix HA have 
to be of the same signs, i.e., all positive or all negative. 
The null space vector matrix HA can be obtained by 
0=AAH                                                   (7) 
Expressing Eq. (7) yields

Equations (8)-(10) show that the joint torques on 
DIP, PIP and MCP due to tendon 1 force are equivalent 
to the resultant joint torques due to all other tendon 
forces. Rearranging Eq. (8) gives

According to the anatomical structure of MCP joint 
as shown in Fig. 3 and based on assumption S4, since 
tendon 3 (FDS) is located outside of tendon 2 (FDP), 
the pulley radius of tendon 3 (FDS) on MCP is 
considered larger than that of tendon 2 (FDP). Thus, 
3M 2Mr r>                                                           (17) 
Moreover, since tendon 3 (FDS) is located inside 
tendon 2 (FDP) on PIP joint, the pulley radius of tendon 
3 (FDS) on MCP is smaller than that of tendon 2 (FDP). 
Hence, 
2P 3Pr r>                                                             (18)

Hence, we have 
C2. The ratio between the pulley radius on MCP 
and on PIP where routed by tendon 3 (FDP) is greater 
than that by tendon 2 (FDP) as described in Eq. (19).

and s1=sin(θMCP), s12=sin(θMCP+θPIP), s123=sin(θMCP 
+θPIP+θDIP), c1=cos(θMCP), c12=cos(θMCP+θPIP) and c123 
=cos(θMCP+θPIP+θDIP), and a1, a2 and a3 are the lengths 
of the proximal-phalange link, the middle-phalange link 
and the distal-phalange link, respectively. 
In order for all elements in the tendon force matrix 
ξC in Eq. (27) to be identical, all elements in null space 
vector matrix HB also have to be identical, i.e., HB=[1 1 
1 1]T. Thus, Eqs. (8)-(10) can be rewritten as 
31 32b b=                                                               (33) 
21 22 23b b b= +                                                       (34)

Based on Eqs.(30)-(35), nine system equations are 
used to solve for the nine design parameters, i.e., b11, b21, 
b23, b12, b22, b32, b13, b23, and b14, and constant μ in Eq. 
(30) can be assigned arbitrarily. Lengths of the proximal 
phalange, the middle phalange and the distal phalange 
of an index finger for an average male Taiwanese adult 
are obtained as a1=50 mm, a2=22 mm, a1=19 mm based 
on the statistics from the anthropometric database of the 
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) [17]. 
The isotropy configuration of an index finger is 
obtained by measuring the joint angles of MCP, PIP, 
and DIP while the index finger is pointing a specific 
object as θMCP=20o, θPIP=30 o, and θDIP=0. Substituting 
the anthropometric data into Eqs. (30)-(35) yields

Table 2 shows the width and the height of each 
tendon on MCP joint. Since the cross-section of a 
tendon is close to an oval shape, the physiological cross-
sectional area of each tendon is proportional to the 
product of its width and height. The reciprocal of the 
cross-section ratio can then be normalized as those

To avoid interference, sum of the maximum radius

The kinematic modeling and synthesis of a finger-
alike, tendon-driven, articulated manipulator based on 
the finger anatomy and kinesiology is presented. 
Through the investigation of the structure and 
functionality of an anatomical index finger, EDC, FDS, 
FDP, and LU are identified as the four tendons that 
control the primary extension and flexion motion of a 
finger. The constructed structure matrix of a finger-alike, 
tendon-driven, articulated manipulator abides the 
necessary conditions of an admissible tendon-driven, 
articulated manipulator [10]. The structure matrix is also 
complied with the characteristics of a human finger and 
justified by the experimental results from other studies. 
Synthesis of an isotropic finger-alike articulated 
manipulator considering the strength of tendon is also 
accomplished.
