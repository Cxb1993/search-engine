Abstract 
The manufacturing intelligence for 
successful enterprise is existed in human, 
process, system and data. Owing the rise of 
e-commerce and information technology (IT) 
enhancement, a large amount of data has been 
automatically or semi- automatically collected 
in modern industry. However, those 
manufacturing intelligence behind the data are 
not be extracted and kept. As the shrinking 
feature size and the advanced technology of 
integrated circuit (IC), the impact of 
unpredictable variations of manufacturing 
process are increasing and hardly be solved by 
manufacturing process improvement alone, 
while it can be improved by design of chip 
layout pattern. However, the spatial data of 
layout pattern for chip, mask and wafer are 
significant related to the yield, throughput due 
to the geometric characteristic and causal 
relationship between design and manufacturing 
management performance. This study aims to 
the construct model of spatial data mining for 
semiconductor which incorporated into 
manufacturing data, on-line metrology, and 
engineering data. The extracted rules are 
transformed to design guideline for IC designer, 
manufacturing engineer and equipment vendor 
for coordinating the design improvement for 
enhancing yield and cost reduction. An 
empirical study will be conducted for 
evaluating the validity of proposed approach.

Abstract. The wafer starts for production schedule significantly influences the production effectiveness and 
profitability for semiconductor fabrication. Demand forecast provides critical input to support the decision of 
wafer starts. The underestimate of demand leads to the loss of profit and customer satisfaction and the 
overestimated of demand results in the increase of stock cost. Moreover, the involved demand uncertainty and 
fluctuation in semiconductor supply chain also increases the difficulty of demand forecast. This study aims to 
propose a manufacturing intelligence approach to assist the decision of capacity allocation based on 
proposed fulfillment ratio and statistical decision theory. To estimate the validity of the proposed approach, an 
empirical study was conducted in a leading semiconductor manufacturing company, in which 72 months were 
applied to construct the demand adjustment model and the following 12 months were used to examine the 
model effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. The results show that the business loss can be reduced and also 
demonstrate the practical visibility of proposed approach.  
 
Keywords: manufacturing intelligence, statistical decision, wafer starts, demand under uncertainty  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive 
industry and need to maintain competitive advantages for 
manufacturing excellence by reducing cycle time, 
producing high quality products, on-time delivering 
product to customer, continual cost reductions and 
improving service capability for customer (Chien and Wu, 
2003) The semiconductor manufacturing process typical 
involves 6 to 12 week manufacturing lead-time by different 
technology and product (Karabuk and Wu, 2005). The 
wafer starts for production plan significantly influences the 
production effectiveness and profitability for 
semiconductor fabrication. Demand forecast provides 
critical input to support the decision of wafer starts. The 
quantity of semiconductor products affects capacity 
allocation and capacity level. If capacity level exceeds the 
demand, it leads to capacity idle and resource wastage. On 
the contrary, capacity shortage leads to orders loss and 
damage of satisfaction (Chien et al., 2005).  
Customers often overestimate the actual order to sales 
for ensuring the order fulfillment. In practice, most 
companies forecast the demand by the sales information 
from different customers and then adjust the demand by 
their domain knowledge. Moreover, the involved demand 
uncertainty and fluctuation in semiconductor supply chain 
also increases the difficulty of demand forecast (Geng and 
Jiang, 2009). Most of existing studies regarding the demand 
forecast focused on improving forecast accuracy by 
applying time series model, soft computing methods based 
on historical data. However, little research has been done 
on incorporating the risk of capacity shortage and capacity 
surplus with the forecast model of capacity allocation. 
Focused on the realistic needs for manufacturing 
intelligence, this study aims to construct a manufacturing 
intelligence framework to develop the statistical decision 
model for supporting decision of production plan based on 
adjustment of demand forecast and statistical decision 
theory. In particular, the customer fulfillment ratio is 
developed as the basis of demand estimation and predicted 
interval is built under different fabrication utilization. This 
approach considers each of possible outcomes along the 
time with multi-period demand forecast from sale and 
market perspectives to determine the optimal capacity 
allocation with minimizing the business loss because of 
capacity shortage and oversupply. Then, max-min return 
and min-max regret strategies are used to determine the 
demand under overestimate and underestimate, respectively,

Furthermore, the expected risk that is the aggregated risk 
function weighted by )(  can be used as a basis for 
choosing between different decision rules. Bayesian’s risk

Therefore, the best decision rule can be derived by 
minimizing the integration of expected loss with respect to 
the involved uncertainty as follows:

3. PROPOSED APPROACH 
 
This study proposes a manufacturing intelligence 
framework to develop a statistical decision model for wafer 
start policy based on proposed demand fulfillment ratio and 
statistical decision theory. Fulfillment ratio is proposed to 
detect the signal of demand recovery from stronger order 
booking behavior and to adjust the estimation of customer 
demand by considering fabrication utilization. Statistical d
ecision theory is applied to determine the quantity of capac
ity allocation according to the max-min return and min-
max regret strategies for overestimate and underestimate, 
respectively.  
 
3.1 Problem definition 
 
The wafer starts for production schedule significantly 
influences the production effectiveness and profitability for 
semiconductor fabrication. Demand forecast provides 
critical input to support the decision of capacity allocation 
for wafer starts. The amounts of semiconductor products 
also increase the complexity of capacity allocation and 
difficulty for determining capacity level. If capacity level 
exceeds the demand, it leads to capacity idle and resource 
wastage. On the contrary, capacity shortage leads to orders 
loss and goodwill damage.  
Customers are conservative and place order lately in 
low season. This might exist potential upside opportunity 
when inventory is relatively low. Customers usually book a 
higher demand to insure the sufficient capacity. To reduce 
the surplus capacity, company usually adjusts the capacity 
allocation conservatively for customer demand, i.e. original 
capacity allocation. However, it leads business loss and low 
degree of satisfaction while actual demand is 
underestimated. On the contrary, customers tend to over-
book and increase risk of surplus capacity in high season. 
The surplus wafer start increases work-in process (WIP) 
and longer cycle time.  
 
3.2 Data preparation 
 
A large quantity of historical data of customer order 
for different product is recorded. In order to eliminate noisy, 
missing, and inconsistent data, data preparation is used to 
improve the data quality and construct an effective model 
for estimating capacity allocation. Improving the data 
quality requires dealing with problems such as redundant, 
inconsistent, and missing data. Missing data can be deleted 
or replaced using data cleaning methods.  
The transaction database including order by different 
technology and capacity allocation based on demand 
forecast are integrated to facilitate convenient data analysis. 
The data are segmented by month with different technology 
and also separated into training data and testing data. 
Training data are used to construct the model for estimation 
of capacity allocation. Testing data are used to validate the 
accuracy of estimating capacity allocation by comparing 
with the actual demand. 
 
3.3 Capacity allocation estimation 
 
This study proposes a customer fulfillment ratio to 
evaluate the customer order behavior by order and allocated 
capacity and is defined as following.  
 
allocationcapacity 
orderratiot fulfillmen   (4) 
 
The fulfillment ratio is used to represent the baseline of 
booking behavior of customer under the specific period of 
demand forecast. Capacity allocation is based on demand 
forecast which is combined the regional sales inputs and 
then is adjusted by experience and market insights of 
domain expert (Chien et al., 2010). Customer often orders 
steadily to reduce the risk before the due day of booking. In 
addition, the fabrication utilization is fulfilled 
approximately in the high season. The customer order is 
booked conservatively in low season and results in low 
fabrication utilization. The order is still conservative even 
through the trend from low season to high season. 
Therefore, the upper bound and lower bound of fulfillment 
ratio are built as 
ijxij Skx   by different fabrication 
utilization and trend. In particular, ijx  is mean of 
fulfillment at ith region and jth trend, S  is standard error 
of fulfillment at ith region and jth trend, and k is constant. 
Then, fulfillment ratio can be derived from utilization and 
trend through linear interpolation method as follows:  
  
4. EMPIRICAL STUDY 
 
4.1 Problem definition and data preparation 
 
Capacity planning depends on demand forecasting. In 
order to fulfill the demand forecast, capacity allocation 
decision is made under both risk of capacity shortage and 
oversupply. If the actual demand is lower than the allocated 
capacity, the tool utilization is not used sufficiently due to 
oversupply and leads to waste of allocated capacity. If the 
actual demand is higher than the allocated capacity, 
capacity shortage and unsupported demand lead to loss or 
orders and influence customer satisfaction in the future. 
Furthermore, semiconductor companies also lose the 
market share (Chien and Zheng, 2011).  
To validate the proposed framework, an empirical 
study was conducted from a semiconductor company. 
Without loss of generality, the data were transformed for 
the empirical study. The historical data including the 
historical capacity allocation, different customer order, and 
utilization of each technology were collected. In particular, 
capacity allocation and utilization of each technology were 
recorded monthly. The orders of different customer were 
recorded daily and need to be aggregated by month. The 
capacity utilization is obtained by the amounts of output 
divide the capacity level. The total time horizon for the 
selected data is 84 months, in which the first 72 months 
were used for constructing model of fulfillment ratio and 
the remaining 12 months were used for examine the model 
effectiveness.  
 
4.2 Capacity allocation estimation 
 
A rolling forecast mechanism is applied to update 
demand forecast and incorporate the latest information for 
decision of capacity allocation in practice. Original 
capacity allocation is provided from different perspective of 
customer information in different area and judgment of 
industry growth trend and business cycle. However, the 
decision of amount of wafer starts need to be determined 
before 2 month due to the production lead time, which 
means the capacity allocation at period t+2 needs to be 
decided at the period t.  
The estimated model of fulfillment ratio is developed 
as the basis of demand estimation of capacity allocation. 
Firstly, the customer fulfillment ratio, order data of period 
t+2 are needed to divide into several regions by different 
utilizations and trends. To compare with the historical fab 
utilization, discuss with the domain experts, the utilization 
regions are divided into 50-70%, 70-80%, 80-100% and 
above 100%. The trend-up and trend-down are evaluated by 
the moving average. Then, the predicted intervals are 
constructed for different regions under different utilizations 
and trends by the equation 
ijxij Sx 1  as shown in Table 
1. Next, the linear interpolation method is applied to 
estimate the fulfillment ratio. For example, the utilization is 
76% and the trend is up, the estimation of fulfillment ratio 
is 03.26)7580()7576(18.259.25  .

4.3 Decision tree model 
 
After constructing estimated model for capacity 
allocation, decision tree model was used to determine the 
decision of capacity allocation with considering the risk of 
capacity shortage and capacity surplus. The alternatives of 
capacity allocation are provided based on the adjusted 
capacity allocation (A) and original capacity allocation (C). 
According to the historical data, when the adjusted capacity 
allocation is higher than the original capacity allocation, the 
probability that the actual demand is higher than the 
original capacity allocation by company is 0.9 and the 
remaining is 0.1. While the adjusted capacity allocation is 
less than the original capacity allocation, the probability 
that the actual demand is higher than the original capacity 
allocation by company is 0.1 and the remaining is 0.9. Then, 
several demand scenarios are considered for representing 
actual demand and the return for each scenario is calculated. 
By discussing with domain experts, the ratio of B1 to B
2 is about 1/3. Next, the max-min return or min-max 
regret strategies were applied to select the best decision of 
capacity allocation.  
Figure 3 illustrates the decision tree model while the 
74th month is used to determine the capacity allocation for 
76th month. Firstly, based on the estimated fulfillment ratio 
and current order, the estimation of capacity allocation is 
69312 and the original capacity allocation is 29414. The 
possible alternatives of capacity allocation are derived by 
both 69312 and 29414. Then, the alternative of capacity 
allocation is suggested 49363 with the maximum return 
(113709) according to the max-min return strategy.
