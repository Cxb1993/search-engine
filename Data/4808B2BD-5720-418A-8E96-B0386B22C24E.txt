I. INTRODUCTION
The direct heat conduction problems are concerned with the determination of
temperature at interior points of a region when the initial and boundary conditions,
thermophysical properties, heat generation and the geometry of the physical problems
are specified. In contrast, the inverse heat conduction problem involves the
determination of the surface conditions [1], energy generation [2] and
thermoproperties [3-5], etc, from the knowledge of the temperature measurements
taken within the body or on the surface. However, when the geometry of the problems
is subjected to change and unknown, the technique of Shape Identification Problem
should be utilized to estimate the unknown domain configurations.
In the previous work by Huang and Chao [6], a steady-state shape identification
problem has been solved successfully by using boundary element method with both
the Levenberg-Marquardt method (LMM) and conjugate gradient method (CGM) [7].
They concluded that the CGM is better than the LMM since the former needs very
short computer time, does not require a very accurate initial guess of the boundary
shape and needs fewer sensors. Based on the algorithm developed in [6], Huang and
Tsai [8] extended to a transient inverse geometry problem in identifying the unknown
irregular boundary configurations from external measurements. However, the search
directions for [6] and [8] are restricted in the y-direction, i.e. the unknown parameters
are y-coordinates only. To overcome this limitation Huang et al. [9] have developed a
new algorithm for two-dimensional multiple cavities estimations where they do not
confine the search directions, i.e. the unknown parameters become x- and
y-coordinates. Huang and Chen [10] extended the similar algorithm to a multiple
5transforms the inverse problem to the solution of three problems, namely, the direct,
sensitivity and the adjoint problems. The method will be discussed in detail.
II. THE DIRECT PROBLEM
The following two-dimensional heat conduction problem in a multiple (three)
region domain is used to illustrate the methodology for developing expressions in
determining simultaneously the interfacial configurations. The boundary conditions
for regions 1, 2 and 3 are all assumed insulated at x = 0 and L. The boundary
condition for 1 at y = 0 is subjected to a Robin condition with ambient temperature
hT and heat transfer coefficient h. The boundary condition for 3 at y = H is also
subjected to a Robin condition with ambient temperature cT and heat transfer
coefficient h. The interface conditions along (x) and 2(x) are assumed perfect
thermal contact condition, i.e. temperatures and heat fluxes for regions 1, 2 and
regions2 ,3 are the same alone(x) and2(x), respectively.
Figure 1 shows the geometry and the coordinates for the two-dimensional
composite material considered here, where the dots “” (M=20) and triangles “” 
(M=10) denote the sensors’ locations on the surface y = 0 and y = H.
The dimensionless mathematical formulation of this heat conduction problem in
three regions is given by:

7The direct problem considered here is concerned with the determination of the
medium temperatures when the interfacial configurations along(x) and2(x), other
thermal properties and the boundary conditions are known.
III. THE SHAPE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM
For the shape identification problem, the interfacial configurations along (x)
and 2(x)are regarded as being unknown, but everything else in direct problem, i.e.
equations (1) to (5) are known. In addition, temperature readings taken at some
appropriate locations at y = 0 and H are considered available.
Referring to Figure 1, we assume that M sensors installed along y = 0 and H are
used to record the temperature information to identify simultaneously the interfacial
configurations along (x) and 2(x)in the shape identification calculations. Let the
temperature reading taken by these sensors be denoted by Y1(xm,0) Y1(xm) and
Y3(xm,H) Y3(xm); m = 1 to M, where M represents the number of thermocouples.
We note that the measured temperatures Y1(xm) and Y3(xm) contain measurement
errors. This shape identification problem can be stated as follows: by utilizing the
above mentioned measured temperature data Y1(xm) and Y3(xm), estimate
simultaneously the unknown interfacial configurations(x) and2(x).
The solution of the present shape identification problem is to be obtained in
such a way that the following functional is minimized:

where(x-xm) is the Dirac delta function and xm (m = 1 to M) refers to the measured
positions. T1(xm) and T3(xm) are the estimated or computed temperatures along y = 0
and H at the measurement locations (xm,0) and (xm,H), respectively. These quantities
are determined from the solution of the direct problem given previously by using the
estimated(x) and2(x) for the exact(x) and2(x).
9order to develop expressions for the determination of these quantities, the sensitivity
problems and adjoint problems are constructed as described below.
IV-1. SENSITIVITY PROBLEMS AND SEARCH STEP SIZES
Since the problem involves two unknown interfacial boundary configurations
1(x) and2(x), in order to derive the sensitivity problem for each unknown function,
we should perturb the unknown function one at a time.
The first sensitivity problem can be obtained from the original direct problem
defined by equations (1), (2) and (3) by assuming that when 1(x) undergoes a
variation 1(x), T1, T2 and T3 are perturbed by 1Tˆ , 2Tˆ and 3Tˆ , respectively.
Then replacing 1 in the direct problem by 1+1, T1 by T1+ 1Tˆ , T2 by T2+ 2Tˆ
and T3 by T3+ 3Tˆ , subtracting from the resulting expressions the direct problem and
neglecting the second-order terms, the following sensitivity problem for the
sensitivity functions 1Tˆ , 2Tˆ and 3Tˆ are obtained.

problems.
Similarly, the second sensitivity problem can be obtained by assuming that
when 2(x) undergoes a variation 2(x), T1, T2 and T3 is perturbed by 1T
~ , 2T
~
and 3T
~ , respectively. By following the same procedures as stated before, the
equations for the second sensitivity problem are identical to the first sensitivity
problem except for the interfacial conditions. The interfacial conditions for the second
sensitivity problem can be obtained as

It is noted that the second sensitivity problem are also now de-coupled as two
independent problems at y = 2(x) since the interface conditions along 2(x) become
independent to each other now. The BEM technique is used to solve this sensitivity
problem.
Based on equations (5) and (17), the following interfacial conditions along2(x)
can also be obtained

IV-2. ADJOINT PROBLEM AND GRADIENT EQUATION
To obtain the first adjoint problem, equations (1a), (2a) and (3a) are multiplied
by the Lagrange multipliers (or adjoint functions) (1), (2) and (3),
respectively, and the resulting expression is integrated over the corresponding space
domains. Then the result is added to the right hand side of equation (6) to yield the
following expression for the functional  )x(),x(J 21  as:

The standard techniques of BEM can be used to solve the above adjoint
problems.
Finally all terms are utilized to set up the above complete expressions for
adjoint problems and nothing is left for the determination of gradient equation. This
also differs from our previous relevant study [10].
In order to obtain the expression of gradient equation for use in the conjugate
gradient algorithm, an over-utilized condition containing (x) must be used again.
It can be found that the following integral term must be used again even thought it
was used implicitly as the interfacial condition in equation (27)

If the problem contains no measurement errors, the traditional check condition
is specified as
  )]x(),x([J 1n21n1 (35)
where is a small-specified number. However, the observed temperature data may
contain measurement errors. For this reason we do not expect the functional equation
(4) to be equal to zero at the final iteration step. Following the experience of the
authors [6-8], we use the discrepancy principle as the stopping criterion, i.e. we
assume that the temperature residuals may be approximated by
1m1m1 )x(Y)x(T  (36a)
3m3m3 )x(Y)x(T  (36b)
where and 3are the standard deviation of the measurements at y = 0 and H,
respectively, which are assumed to be a constant. Substituting equation (36) into
equation (6), the following expression is obtained for stopping criteria:

The computational procedure for the solution of this shape identification
problem using conjugate gradient method may be summarized as follows:
Suppose1n(x) and2 n(x) are available at iteration n.
Step 1. Solve the direct problem given by equations (1) to (5) for
T1(1), T2(2) and T3(3).
Step 2. Examine the stopping criterion given by equation (35) withgiven by
equation (37). Continue if not satisfied.
Step 3. Solve the adjoint problems for1(1),2(2),3(3) and
 4(1),5(2),6(3).

In all the test cases considered here we have chosen L = 10.0 m, H = 3.0
m, hT = 100
oC, cT = 10
oC and h = 10 W/m2-oC. Twenty constant elements are
used on both upper and lower boundaries, while twenty constant elements are also
adopted for each domain on the right and left boundaries. The sensor's locations are
placed along y = 0 and H m, i.e. on the lower and upper boundaries. The initial guess
for all test case considered here is chosen as10(x) = 1.0 m and20(x) = 2.0 m.
We now present below two numerical experiments in simultaneous determining
1(x) and2(x) by the present shape identification analysis:

Firstly the shape identification analysis is performed by assuming k1 = 3, k2 =
20, and k3 = 8 W/m-oC. Twenty thermocouple measurements are used, i.e. M = 20,
along y = 0 and H m (referring to Figure 1 where the solid circular dots denote the
sensors’ location) withthermocouple spacing x = 0.5 m. The estimated results for
the interfacial configurations of1(x) and2(x) by using measurement errors (1,3)
= (0.0,0.0), (0.4,0.1) and (0.8,0.2) are reported in Table 1. The average relative errors
between exact and estimated interfacial boundary configurations are defined as

the same order when comparing with the previous test case with exact measurements
in Table 1.
Next let us discuss the influence of the measurement errors on the inverse
solutions. First, the measurement errors for the temperature are taken as (1,3) =
(0.8,0.2), i.e. about 1 % of the average measured temperature. Then error is increased
to (1,3) = (1.6,0.4), i.e. about 2 % of the average measured temperature. The
estimated interfacial shapes are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, which are also
reported in Table 1.
The number of iteration for (1,3) = (0.8,0.2) is 2 and the average errors for
1(x) and 2(x) are calculated as (ERR1,ERR2) = (3.41%,5.21%). The number of
iteration for (1,3) = (0.8,0.2) is also 2 and the average errors for1(x) and2(x) are
calculated as (ERR1,ERR2) = (3.42%,5.26%). By comparing the estimated results of
the above cases in Table 1 we found it is as what we expected that when the value of
difference between k1, k2 and k3 is increased, good estimations can be obtained by
using less accurate measurement data.
The above test cases seem unrealistic, since too many sensors were used in the
numerical experiments. Now the question arises, can the number of sensors be
reduced with the present approaches?
In the CGM, the measurement temperatures at sensors’ locations represent the
boundary point sources that appeared in the adjoint equations (24d) and (26d). It is
possible to reduce the number of boundary point sources even though it will influence
the value of J1' and J2'. Now the question is that will this strategy influence the
accuracy of the inverse solutions? To answer this, the numerical experiments are
moved on to the case with M = 10 (x = 1.0 m) in simultaneous estimating1(x) and
2(x) with measurement errors (1,3) = (0.0,0.0), (0.8,0.2) and (1.6,0.4), respectively.
The estimated interfacial configurations are plotted in Figures 2, 3 and 4, respectively,
and the results are also reported in Table 1 as well.
From the above comparisons of Figures and numerical data we learned that the
inverse solutions in predicting1(x) and2(x) with 20 sensors are slightly better than
23
(ERR1,ERR2) = (3.49%,4.16%), respectively. When (1,3) = (1.6,0.4) and M = 10
are considered, the number of iterations and the average errors for the estimated
interfacial configurations are 2 and (ERR1,ERR2) = (5.81%,9.38%), respectively.
Again, this denotes that the CGM is not sensitive to the measurement errors.
From the above two numerical test cases we concluded that the advantages of
using CGM in estimating unknown interfacial configurations lie in that (1). The rate
of convergence is fast and (2). The number of sensor can be reduced while the
accurate inverse solutions can still be obtained.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
The conjugate gradient method (CGM) was successfully applied for the solution
of the shape identification problem to determine simultaneously the unknown
irregular interfacial configurations by utilizing temperature readings. Several test
cases involving different functional forms of 1(x) and 2(x), different measurement
errors and different number of sensors were considered. The results show that (1). The
CGM needs very short CPU time on Pentium IV 1.4 GHz PC; (2). The CGM is not
sensitive to the measurement errors and (3). The number of sensors can be reduced in
performing the shape identification calculations.
