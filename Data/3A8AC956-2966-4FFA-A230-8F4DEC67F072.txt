1.  INTRODUCTION 
Spinel copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) powder and its properties has been 
the subject of many recent investigations [1-4]. Among bimetallic 
spinel-type oxides, CuFe2O4 is a useful catalyst. The basic properties 
of microstructure, predominate phase and magnetization have been 
obtained from fine particles[5,6]. Recently, Fu and Lin reported that 
the entire microwave-induced combustion synthesis process to 
prepare nano-powder requires only a few minutes to yield 
nano-powder [7,8]. The combustion synthesis process dissolves metal 
nitrate and urea in water, and then heats the solution in a microwave 
oven. The urea and metal nitrate decompose and produce gasses 
such as NH3, N2, and CO2, respectively. After the solution reaches 
the point of spontaneous combustion, it begins burning and becomes 
solid, and burns at a high temperature. The combustion is not 
finished until all the flammable substances are burned out,  
resulting in a loose substance displaying voids, pores, and high 
friability formed by the escaping gases during the combustion 
reaction.  
Because of its function as an anti-free radical, helping prevent 
aging, apoplexy, heart disease, cardiovascular vessel disease and 
anti-cancer, Vitamin E is an important vitamin today.  At present, 
the demand for this vitamin has reached several million pounds 
every year [9].  The reason for the high cost is that the initial 
reactant of Vitamin E is difficult to produce on a large scale.  
Therefore, many scientists are searching for a way to mass produce 
TMBQ, rapidly, effectively, and cost efficiently with an 
environmentally friendly process [10,11].  At present, in terms of 
industrial production and academic research, most researchers use 
2,3,6-trimethylphenol(TMP) as the initial reactant for synthesizing 
TMBQ by metal ions[12-19]. Jean-Pierre Aguer[20] observed that TMP 
efficiently oxidizes in the presence of  Fe(III) apuacomplexes.   
The common points of these methods are the metal ions used as 
catalysts to obtain a high yield.  However, these catalysts are 
expensive and difficult to prepare.  On the other hand, the catalysts 
and products are separated after the reaction when they are dissolved 
in solution. Molecular collisions are essential for a reaction of two or 
more molecules to occur.  Therefore, there is low conversion when 
two immiscible reactants react due to the low mutual solubility and 
limited contact surface area.  The conventional methods to 
overcome this problem are to carry out the reaction at a higher 
temperature, with a higher agitation speed, or to use a solvent or 
cosolvent which has both lipophilic and hydrophilic properties.  
However, improvement in the reaction of the two immiscible 
reactants is limited because the byproducts are frequently produced 
from side reactions at higher temperatures.  The reactivity of a 
nucleophilic reagent is decreased for solvation and hydrogen 
bonding with a protic solvent.  Therefore, the reaction rate is low 
when protic solvents are used.  The solvation of aprotic solvents 
and nucleophilic reagents was minimized. However, the reactions 
were carried out under anhydrous conditions using an expensive 
aprotic solvent.  Further, the higher boiling point of aprotic solvent 
is difficult to recover.  These problems have been overcome by 
introducing phase transfer catalysis [21]. Furthermore, the 
combination of oxidizing agents and copper ferrite is industrially 
important because the oxidation process is environmentally benign 
and therefore in line with green chemistry[22,23]. 
The purpose of this study is to synthesize the TMBQ from the 
reaction of TMP and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by CuFe2O4 
catalysis in an acid /organic solvent two-phase medium.  However, 
when an excessively large amount of H2O2 reagent in relation to that 
of TMP and a large amount of hydrogenchloric acid (HCl) were used, 
the oxidation took place in the solution in both cases.  The 
sequential oxidation of TMP was examined in detail. The reaction 
was greatly enhanced both in the presence of HCl and CuFe2O4 
powder.  Based on the experimental data, a rational mechanism is 
proposed to account for the observed reaction. A kinetic model is 
derived, from which the pseudo-steady-state hypothesis (PSSH) is 
applied. A simplified pseudo-first order rate equation is derived to 
describe the experimental data[17,24]. This study investigated the 
reaction conditions in detail. The conditions under investigation 
included various catalysts, organic solvents, the amount of copper 
ferrite catalyst, amount of HCl, amount of H2O2, volume of 
dichloromethane, and the volume of water on the yields of TMBQ 
obtained from TMP.  A rational reaction mechanism is proposed to 
satisfactorily explain the experimental results.

leads to poor crystallinity and reduced magnetic strength due to the 
formation of Fe2O3. Thus, the values of the magnetization measured 
at higher annealing temperatures are greater.  
3.2. Kinetics of synthesizing 2,3,5-trimethylquinone (TMBQ)  
The mechanism of the catalyzing oxidation reaction of TMP by 
copper catalyst is described as follows: copper ion first reacts with 
TMP, wherein the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the TMP is attacked by 
the copper ion, causing departure of hydrogen ions and the formation 
of free radicals on -O.  Thereafter, the free radicals on the oxygen 
atom transfer to the carbon atom opposite the oxygen atom on the 
ring of benzene, and react with oxidant to form TMBQ.  However, 
the carbon atom attacked by the copper ion is positioned opposite the 
hydroxyl group (-OH), resulting in the destruction of the ring of 
benzene and the formation of a free radical on the carbon atom of the 
ring of benzene.  Figure 4 shows the variations in the concentration 
of the three main components during the reaction, wherein, the 
intermediate TMHQ tends to be flat after 40 minutes under a high 
concentration of hydrochloric acid and copper ferrite, and the 
reaction forms the maximum amount of intermediate (TMHQ).  For 
further reaction, thereafter, the TMHQ gradually decreases and the 
amount of TMBQ increases with increasing reaction time. Based on 
this evidence, the kinetics of the CuFe2O4 catalysis are discussed 
below.  
(a) Effect of the agitation speed. 
The effects of the agitation speed on the yield of TMBQ were 
investigated for 1.200 g of TMP, 20 mL of H2O2, 5 mL of HCl, 0.402 
g of CuFe2O4 catalyst at 60℃, with a volume ratio of 50 mL/20 mL 
of C2H4Cl2/H2O.  The results are shown in Figure 5.  Clearly, the 
reaction follows the pseudo first-order rate law.  The yield of 
TMBQ is increased with the increase in agitation speed up to 800 
rpm. However, there are no significant improvements in the reaction 
when further increasing the agitation speed from 800 rpm to 1,000 
rpm. This result appears to show that the interface reaction of TMP 
and H2O2 plays an important role in the entire reaction system. 
Therefore, to study the reaction phenomena from which the 
resistance of mass transfer stays at a constant , the agitation speed 
was set at 1,000 rpm.   
(b) Effect of the amount of CuFe2O4 catalyst. 
As stated, the reaction is greatly enhanced by adding CuFe2O4 
catalyst to the yield of TMBQ.  Figure 6 illustrates the influence of 
the amount of copper ferrite on the yield of 
2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone with hydrogenchloric acid; 
wherein, the yield of 2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone is 
significantly influenced by using copper ferrite as a catalyst for 
oxidation 2,3,6- trimethylphenol . There is no reaction between TMP 
and H2O2 in the absence of the HCl and CuFe2O4 agent.  The yield 
of TMBQ is still low without the CuFe2O4 catalyst, even when HCl 
is present in the solution, and the reaction is dramatically increased 
by adding an additional 0.201 g of CuFe2O4 catalyst. Clearly, 
CuFe2O4 is an effective catalyst for enhancing the reaction. It 
possesses more copper active sites, so the oxidation reaction is 
enhanced, and it can be easily separated from the solution. The 
magnetic catalyst could be facilely isolated from the reaction 
mixture by magnetic decantation. Catalysts generally reduce the 
energy of activation so that the product might be formed at a higher 
yield of 2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone.  The reaction follows a 
pseudo-first order rate law with the conversion increasing with 
increasing amounts of CuFe2O4 catalyst up to 0.600 g. The basic 
CuFe2O4 and HCl reacted with TMP to produce an active 
intermediate TMHQ which can react with the organic-phase reactant 
to produce the desired product (TMBQ).  
(c) Effect of the amount of HCl. 
Figure 7 shows the effect of HCl on the yield of TMBQ in the 
presence of 0.400 g of CuFe2O4 catalyst.  The yield of TMBQ is 
relatively low when no HCl is added, although the expression of the 
kinetic model shown in the Equation (R3~R4) does not suggest that 
HCl affects the yield or the reaction rate.  However, we believe HCl 
affects the environment of the reaction.  The distribution of the 
active intermediate (TMHQ) in the organic phase is highly 
influenced by the concentration of HCl. Therefore, the reactivity of 
the active intermediate (TMHQ) is affected by the amount of HCl in 
the aqueous solution.  Figure 7 shows that both the conversion and 
the reaction rate increase when increasing the amount of HCl up to 
10.0 mL.  
(d) Effect of the volume of water. 
In general, the volume of water directly affects the concentration of 
HCl in the aqueous phase and the distribution of TMHQ between 
two phases.  Therefore, the conversion (or the reaction rate) should 
be affected by the volume of water.  Figure 8 shows the effect of 
the amount of water on the yield of TMBQ.  In principle, the yield 
of TMBQ is decreased when the volume of water is increased.  The 
generally accepted reason for this is that the moles or the 
concentration of TMHQ in the organic phase are almost constant 
when the amount of H2O is fixed at a certain quantity with an 
excessive amount of H2O2.  Therefore, the yield of TMBQ is 
decreased with the increase in the volume of water. 
(e) Effect of the amount of H2O2. 
The effect of the amount of H2O2 on the yield of TMBQ is shown in 
Figure 9.  It can be seen that the conversion of TMBQ (or the 
reaction rate) is not affected by the amount of H2O2.  The amount 
of H2O2 used is excessive. In this work, TMP, which is an organic 
soluble compound, is used in a limited quantity relative to the 
quantity of H2O2.  
(f) Effect of temperature. 
The effect of temperature on the yield of TMBQ for the reaction 
being carried out in 1,2-dichloroethane is shown in Figure 10.  The 
increase in temperature enhances the reaction rate and the yield of 
TMBQ.  The reaction also follows the pseudo-first order rate law. 
An Arrhenius plot for –ln(kapp,2) vs. 1/T is shown in Figure 11.  The 
activation energy is 73.29 kJ/mol for C2H4Cl2.   The Arrhenius 
equation for the reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane is  
C2H4Cl2 : kapp,2 = 1.028x109 exp(-8815/T) 
(g) Effect of the organic solvents. 
 This study examine the influences of four organic solvents, 
including 1,2-dichlorobenzene, benzene, chlorobenzene and 
1,2-dichloroethane, on the oxidation of TMP, with the results shown 
in Figure 12.  The order of reactivity for these four organic solvents 
is: C6H4Cl2(9.93) > C6H6 (2.27) > C6H5Cl (5.62) > C2H4Cl2 (10.37) .  
The yield of TMBQ is not affected by the dielectric constant of the 
organic solvent.   
 
4.  CONCLUSIONS 
The sequential reaction of oxidations of TMP by a H2O2 under 
copper ferrite catalysis was carried out in an acid solution of 
HCl/organic solvent with a two phase medium.  Copper ferrites 
were employed as the catalysts to promote the reactions. Recovery of 
the catalyst was facilely achieved by simple magnetic decantation in a 
green chemistry process. This goal was achieved using an excessive 
amount of H2O2 reagent relative to the amount of TMP and a high 
acid concentration of HCl. 
The effects of the reaction conditions, including various agitation 
speeds, the amount of CuFe2O4 powder catalyst, the amount of HCl, 
the volume of water, the amount of hydrogen peroxide, organic 
solvents and the temperature, on the yields of TMBQ oxidation were 
examined in detail.  A rational reaction mechanism is proposed to 
satisfactorily explain the experimental results. By plotting the

In this work, it is difficult to identify the occurrence of the reaction 
of TMP and H2O2 on the interface.  In fact, the two-phase reaction of 
TMP and H2O2 may take place on the interface between two phases or 
in the organic phase because of the water-soluble and organic soluble 
nature of TMP. The mass transfer of the H2O2, TMP, TMHQ and 
TMBQ are also rapid, and the reaction of the conformation of TMBQ 
is clearly a rate determining step (k1>>k2).  Therefore, a simple 
kinetic rate law is used to model the reaction system in this work.  
Based on the experimental data, it is noted the concentration of 
TMBQ in the organic phase follows a pseudo-first-order rate law.  
Therefore, we have
