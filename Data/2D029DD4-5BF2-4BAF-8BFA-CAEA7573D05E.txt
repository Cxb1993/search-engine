algorithm (MRBMA) [12], fast search with predictive searching area [13], and enhanced predictive zonal 
search (EPZS) [14]. Another approach for motion estimation is called the partial-matching error technique, 
which can obtain the same SAD as the FSBMA [15, 16]. Compared to FSBMA, this kind of approach 
may reduce the computational complexity significantly. This kind of technique first calculates the 
complete matching error at the predicted position and uses it as the initial minimum matching error (the 
initial minimum SAD). For each other search position, some forms of partial matching errors are first 
calculated. The calculation of the complete SAD can be avoided, if the partial error is larger than the 
minimum SAD. Otherwise, the complete matching error (the complete SAD) is calculated and the 
minimum SAD is updated if the newly calculated matching error is smaller than the original one. 
This project is planned for two years. In the first year, a fast block matching algorithm is developed. 
This algorithm uses the correlation between layers of the sum pyramid for a block to predict the searching 
set. Using elimination criteria and predicted motion vector, this method can further reduce the computing 
time significantly. In the following, we will present the primary results of the first year. 
3. 研究方法 
In the first year, a fast block matching algorithm is developed. Here, we will present our block 
matching algorithm using prediction. The blocks whose reduced resolutions are best matched to the 
reduced resolution of a template block are determined and used to predict the searching area.  
Assume that the current frame It is divided into nonoverlapping blocks of N×N pixels with N = 2n. For 
a block X in It, the pyramid of X can be defined as a set of blocks {X0, X1,…, Xn} with Xm being a 
reduced resolution version of X, where m = 1, 2,…, n. In this paper, Xm is called the mth resolution 
version of X. We note that Xm has 2m×2m pixels. The gray value at the pixel location (p, q) of Xm is 
denoted as Xm(p, q). Similarly, The gray value at the pixel location (p, q) of Xm-1 is represented by 
Xm-1(p, q), which can be obtained from four gray values: Xm(2p, 2q), Xm(2p, 2q+1), Xm(2p+1, 2q), and 
Xm(2p+1, 2q+1). That is, 
Xm-1(p, q) = Xm(2p, 2q)+Xm(2p, 2q+1)+Xm(2p+1, 2q)+Xm(2p+1, 2q+1) (3) 
Let Ym be the mth resolution version of a block Y in the previous frame It-1. The SAD of Xm and Ym is 
denoted as SADmX,Y, which can be calculated by the following equation: 
SADmX,Y = ⎥ Xm(p, q)- Ym(p, q)⎥ (4) ∑−

where M = 2m. Xm(p, q) and Ym(p, q) represent the gray values at the (p, q)th pixels of Xm and Ym, 
respectively. Suppose that the block Yb in the previous frame It-1 is the best matched block of a template 
block X in It. Denote Pri(l) as the probability that Ybi (0 ≤ i < n) is the lth best matched block of Xi and let 
CPri(l) be the corresponding cumulative probability, which is defined as: 
CPri(l) = Pri(j) (5) ∑

Let Li(r) be the minimum number of l such that CPri(l) ≥ r, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1. That is, 
Li(r) = (CPri(l) ≥ r) (6)

way that their SAD0X,Yj are minimum. Set i = 1. 
(3) Let S*i-1 = {Y*1, Y*2,…, Y*m(i-1)} = {Y1, Y2,…, Ym(i-1)}. For each Y∈S*i-1, calculate its SADiX,Y. From 
S*i-1, construct Si = {Y1, Y2,…, Ymi} such that SADiX, Yj are minimum, where mi = min(⏐Si-1⏐, Li(r)) 
and j = 1, 2,…, mi. 
(4) Set i ← i + 1. If i < n, go to step (3); otherwise go to step (5). 
(5) Find the best matched block of X from the set Sn-1 and output the corresponding motion vector (u, v). 
  
 The proposed fast block matching algorithm can be combined with other approach to achieve further 
speedup. In this section, we will present the rejection criteria for our algorithm to reduce the 
computational complexity. 
For a template block X in It, an initial motion vector (u , ) is estimated using the spatial correlation 
between two frames. The estimation of (u , ) will be discussed in the next subsection. The SAD between 
block X and a block with displacement (u , ) in frame It-1 is calculated and this value is stored as the 
minimum SAD, which is denoted as SADmin. For other candidate block Y in frame It-1, SAD0X,Y is 
determined first. If SAD0X,Y is larger than SADmin, the candidate block Y is rejected; otherwise 
SAD1X,Y is computed. If SAD1X,Y is greater than SADmin, block Y is also eliminated. That is, if SADiX,Y 
(0 ≤ i < n) is larger than SADmin, the candidate block Y is unlikely to be the best matched block of X. This 
rejection criterion can be combined with FBMAUP to reject candidate blocks in Si, 0 ≤ i < n. The process 
of constructing Si whose elements satisfy rejection criteria is described as follows. Set an upper bound 
UB=SADmin. For each block Y in the set Si-1, the block Y is deleted if (SADi-1X,Y ≥ UB). Let Ni denotes 
the number of blocks in Si. For each candidate block Y in Si-1, Y is added to Si if Ni < Li(r). In the case that 
Ni = Li(r) and SADiX,Y < UB, a block Ymax in Si is replaced by the block Y, where Ymax is determined by 
equation (7). In the present case, UB is updated by (SADiX,Y).

Combined the proposed rejection criteria with FBMAUP, we may obtain a new fast block matching 
algorithm. 
(B) Initial Motion Vector Estimation 
 The initial motion vector (MV) can be estimated through using spatial and temporal correlations of 
motion vectors. The idea is that select a set of candidate motion vectors from spatially and/or temporally 
neighbors and choose the best one as the initial motion vector. 
 Let Xi,j be a template block of N×N pixels at the (i, j)th position of the current frame It and Yk,l be a 
candidate block at the (k, l)th position of the previous frame It-1. Denote the motion vector of block Xi,j as 
(u, v)i, j. Let the sum pyramids of Xi,j and Yk,l be {X0i,j, X1i,j, ..., Xni,j} and {Y0k,l, Y1k,l, ..., Ynk,l}, 
respectively, where n = log 2 N. The SAD between Xmi,j and Ymk,l is denoted as SADm(u, v) for simplicity, 
where m = 1, 2, …, n, u = k – i, and v = l – j. Denote the four neighboring blocks of Xi,j as TBp (p = 1 to 
(7) Set i ← i + 1. If i < n-1, go to step (5). 
(8) Find the best matched block of X from the set Sn-1 and output the corresponding motion vector (u, v). 
4. 結果與討論 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, six sets of video sequences as shown in 
figure 2 are used  All computing is performed on a Pentium IV 3.2 GHz PC with 512 MB of memory. 
Each image of the above mentioned video sequences is of size 352×240. The computing time and PSNR 
(peak signal-to-noise ratio) are used to evaluate the performances of block matching algorithms. In this 
report, PSNR is defined by 
PSNR = 10log10(255 2/MSE) (9) 
where MSE is the mean square error between the original and estimated image frames. In this report, all 
the template and candidate blocks are of size 16×16 and the value of n is 4. The size of search window is 
33×33.  
The values of Li(r) used in our proposed algorithm are determined using the video sequences shown 
in figure 2. Figure 3 shows the values of Lr(i) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3. From figure 3, we can see that the values of 
Li(r) increase rapidly with r for r > 0.90. In our experiments, we find that the number of a candidate block 
Y, in the search window, satisfying SAD0X,Y < SADmin is smaller than L0(r). Therefore, any candidate 
block Y, in the search window, which satisfies SAD0X,Y < SADmin is added to S0 automatically.  
Tables I and II show the primary results. Table 1 and table II present computing time and PSNRs of 
six video sequences for FBMAUPR (for r = 0.98, 0.94, 0.90, 0.80. 0.70. and 0.50).  From table II, we 
can see the PSBR of the video sequence “Mobil,” which is outside the training set, is almost not affected 
by the value of r, when r ≥ 0.9 is used. This explains that the values of Li(r) are not critical for our method 
if r ≥ 0.9 is used. This also demonstrates that using these six video sequences shown in figure 2 to 
estimate the values of Li(r) is acceptable for our method.
