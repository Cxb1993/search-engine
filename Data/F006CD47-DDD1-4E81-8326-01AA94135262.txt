Abstract 
We investigated the temporal evolution 
of micellar nanostructures in solvent-annealed 
poly(styrene-block-4vinylpyridine) P(S-b-4VP) 
monolayer films on bare and PS-grafted 
substrates under tetrahydrofuran (THF) vapor. 
The size of end-grafted PS homopolymers on 
Si substrates has a large effect on the kinetics 
of transitions between spherical and 
cylindrical micelles at the early and 
intermediate stages of solvent annealing. At 
these stages, cylindrical micelles developing 
via micellar merger were dominant over 
spherical micelles growing via micellar 
splitting on substrates grafted with a layer of 
short PS brushes (PS4k-SiOx/Si). On substrates 
having an attractive surface (SiOx/Si) or a 
grafted layer of long PS chains (PS19k-SiOx/Si), 
the dominant surface morphology was 
inverted through the dominance of micellar 
splitting. Upon solvent annealing for a given 
interval in THF, micellar structures existed as 
a single morphology of cylindrical micelles on 
PS4k-SiOx/Si, but appeared as spherical 
micelles on SiOx/Si and PS19k-SiOx/Si. On 
immersion of those micelles in ethanol to give 
rise to opening of the micelles, dimple-like 
nanopores in hexagonal arrays were induced 
on SiOx/Si but stripe-like nanogrooves on 
PS4k-SiOx/Si. We demonstrate a novel method 
of kinetically controlled hierarchical 
self-assembly of P(S-b-4VP) micellar species. 
On combining the chemical micropatterning 
of the grafted layer of PS brushes with 
UV/ozone etching, we prepared P(S-b-4VP) 
films that have dimple-like nanopores and 
stripe-like nanogrooves coexisting with a 
micro-scale order within the same monolayer.

temporal evolution of micellar nanostructures 
on substrates grafted with a layer of PS 
homopolymers. Surface-grafted substrates of 
two molar masses were used (denoted briefly 
as PS4k-SiOx/Si and PS19k-SiOx/Si) to assess 
the effect of chain length of grafted PS. 
Achieving a concurrent presence of micelles 
of two kinds on the same layer registering 
with a macroscopic order on substrates is not 
yet demonstrated. We demonstrate a novel 
method of kinetically controlled hierarchical 
self-assembly of P(S-b-4VP) monolayered 
films on a chemically micro-patterned 
substrate, which was fabricated through 
selective etching of the grafted layer of PS 
brushes with ultraviolet light and ozone. 
Experiments  
Materials 
Hydroxyl-terminated polystyrenes 
(PS4k-OH: Mn = 4 kg/mol, index of 
polydispersity Ip=1.09, and PS19k-OH: Mn = 
19 kg/mol, Ip=1.19) and P(S-b-4VP) (Mn = 44 
kg/mol, fps = 50 % and fP4VP = 50 %, Ip = 1.09) 
block copolymer was purchased (Polymer 
Source, Inc.) and used as received. 
 
Surface Modification of Substrates with 
Spin Coating 
Bare silicon wafers were cleaned in a 
piranha solution (3:7 v/v 30 % H2O2:H2SO4) 
near 23 oC for 40 min, rinsed with deionized 
water, and dried under flowing N2. For 
substrates with surface modification grafted 
with PS brushes, PS-OH solutions (1 mass % 
in toluene) were spin-coated (1000 rpm, 1 min) 
on silicon wafers. The irreversibly grafted 
layers resulted from annealing (190 oC for 3 
days) spin-coated films on hydroxylated 
silicon wafers under vacuum. Non-grafted 
materials were removed on sonication in 
toluene, followed by drying the substrates 
under flowing N2. 
Film Preparation, Annealing and Chemical 
Micropatterning with UV light and Ozone 
P(S-b-4VP) powders were dissolved in a 
mixture (70/30) of toluene and THF at 70 oC 
for 2 h to yield 0.1 and 0.5 mass % solutions. 
P(S-b-4VP) films were spread on substrates 
via spin coating (2000 rpm, 60 s) from toluene 
solutions. The thin films were placed in a 
chamber of saturated THF vapor for varied 
periods (15 – 360 min) of solvent annealing, 
which was performed at a maintained 
temperature 26 oC with humidity less 20 %. 
Surface-reconstructed films were prepared on 
immersion of solvent-annealed films in 
ethanol for 20 min. Chemical micropatterning 
of PS brushes was performed via selective 
etching with ultraviolet light and ozone (10 
min) with a Cu TEM grid shadow mask. 
 
Characterization 
To determine micellar nanostructures, we 
investigated the surface of the thin films with 
an atomic-force microscope (AFM, SPA400 
Seiko) in the tapping mode and with a 
high-resolution field-emission scanning 
electron microscope (HR-FESEM, JEOL 
JSM-7600F) with a field emission source of 
energy 10 keV. AFM images were recorded 
with scan ranges between 1 μm×1 μm and 2 
μm×2 μm. We used aluminium-coated silicon 
cantilevers (length 150 μm, width 26 μm, 
thickness 300 μm); the force coefficient was 
approximately 7.4 N/m and the resonant 
frequency was 160 kHz. The micropatterned 
morphology of P(S-b-4VP) thin films was 
observed with an optical microscope (OM, 
Olympus BX-BLA2) in the reflection mode. 
The thickness of films was measured through 
X-ray reflectivity (X-ray source λ=1.54 Å, XR, 
Bruker,, D8 SSS) and a synchrotron source 
(λ=1.55 Å, beamline 17B at National 
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, 
NSRRC, Hsinchu). To probe the orientation 
5 
 
to the protected region show the developed 
cylindrical micelles. This result indicates that 
a protracted UVO exposure has an effect on 
the grafted PS chains in the protected region 
near the UVO-exposed area. As a result, the 
cylinders were unable to develop well in 
regions near the boundary. The optimum time 
scale to perform UVO exposure was thus 60 s 
to create a substrate with varied surface 
chemistry. As a result, a sharp boundary 
between spherical micelles and cylindrical 
micelles is obtainable for P(S-b-4VP) thin 
films on the substrate. An improved lateral 
ordering of the spherical micelles in regions 
with a brief UVO exposure is notably 
achievable upon solvent annealing in THF. 
Figure 3 a&b shows the 45o-tilted 
FESEM images for the cross-sectional 
morphology of surface-reconstructed 
P(S-b-4VP) films on SiOx/Si and PS4k-SiOx/Si, 
respectively. Before the FESEM 
characterizations, surface-constructed films on 
SiOx/Si and PS4k-SiOx/Si were prepared on 
solvent annealing in THF for 120 min 
followed by immersion in ethanol (effective 
solvent for the P4VP block) for 20 min. The 
preceding AFM images reveal that, with 
solvent annealing in THF for 120 min, long 
cylindrical micelles predominantly cover the 
surface of PS4k-SiOx/Si whereas spherical 
micelles predominate on top of SiOx/Si. The 
FESEM images show that the film on SiOx/Si 
reveals hexagonally arranged nanohole arrays 
whereas the film on PS4k-SiOx/Si reveals 
corrugated channels. The presence of holes 
and corrugated channels upon immersion in 
ethanol is due to selectively migration of the 
P4VP block onto the free surface of the film. 
The holes and corrugated channels thus have a 
depth that is nearly comparable with the film 
thickness. On examination of the strip-like 
nanostructures for the P(S-b-4VP) film on 
PS4k-SiOx/Si, we observed the presence of 
hemispherical caps at ends of the strips. This 
observation indicates that the strips shown in 
the cross-sectional FESEM image of the 
P(S-b-4VP) on PS4k-SiOx/Si are 
parallel-oriented nanocylinders rather than 
vertical nanolamellae. The average diameter 
of the cylinders is 36 nm and the distance 
between centers of neighboring cylinders is 47 
nm. 
As Figure 3(c)&(d) shows, the 
corresponding 2D GISAXS pattern for 
P(S-b-4VP) on SiOx/Si reveals sharp 
diffraction-truncated rods located at q// ratios 1: 
31/2 with respect to the position (q//=0.0138 
Å-1) of the principal rod whereas these 
features with q// ratios 1:41/2:91/2 are clearly 
discerned for P(S-b-4VP) on PS4k-SiOx/Si. A 
comparison between the two GISAXS 
patterns indicates that the rod at q//= 0.0239 
Å-1 that corresponds to the q// ratio 31/2 with 
respect to the position of the principal Bragg 
rod is absent for P(S-b-4VP) on PS4k-SiOx/Si. 
This 31/2 rod typically associated with 
diffraction of the {11} plane is observable 
only for ordered structures with a hexagonal 
packing. The forbidden diffraction might, 
however, be due to the fact that a single 
monograin of vertical cylinders revealed the 
angular dependence of reflections on rotating 
a sample with respect to the incident direction 
of X-rays. As the FESEM image of 
P(S-b-4VP) nanodomains on SiOx/Si reveals 
hexagonal arrays with in-plane polygrains, we 
exclude the existence of a single monograin in 
the case of P(S-b-4VP) on SiOx/Si. Thus, the 
absence of the 31/2 peak is taken to indicate 
that parallel P4VP nanocylinders on 
PS4k-SiOx/Si lack hexagonal order within the 
PS matrix. As only a single monolayer 
thickness of P(S-b-4VP) films was 
spin-coated on the substrates, only one row of 
P4VP cylinders with a parallel orientation 
contributes the q// Bragg peaks in a series with
