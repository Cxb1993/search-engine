bond tests. Therefore, extra test pads have to be 
added for pre-bond tests. Since the size of a test 
pad is significantly larger a TSV, only a limited 
number of test pads can be added. As a result, the 
environment of a pre-bond test is very different from 
that of a post-bond 3D IC test. The major differences 
include power distribution network (PDN), clock tree, 
and scan test architecture, and these differences may 
affect the test cost and correctness of test results. 
In this research project, we will study these test 
challenges in 3D IC testing, and look for ways to 
solve such problems. Our goal is to provide the same 
level of test quality in pre-bond tests and post-bond 
system test under test-pin-count constraint. To 
achieve this goal, the following topics will be 
addressed: (1) delay fault testing in pre-bond test, 
and (2) TSV testing method in low-cost 3D IC testing 
environment.

英文摘要 
Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) 
has attracted enormous attention in recent years, 
as the continuous scaling becomes technically 
difficult and expensive. 3D IC is a promising 
way to further improving IC technology, as it 
provides many advantages, including lower cost, 
low power, alleviating 2D communication 
bottleneck and make possible the integration of 
heterogeneous devices and systems. 
According to a recent study, 3D IC test 
flows with pre-bond testing significantly reduce 
the overall cost. Such a flow ensures the ability 
of known-good die (KGD) stacking. A 3D IC is a 
complete system; however, individual dies are 
not. Normally, all I/O pins are connected to the 
bottom die, while power supply and clock 
signals in upper dies are applied through TSVs, 
which cannot be directly probed in pre-bond 
tests. Therefore, extra test pads have to be added 
for pre-bond tests. Since the size of a test pad is 
significantly larger a TSV, only a limited number 
of test pads can be added. As a result, the 
environment of a pre-bond test is very different 
from that of a post-bond 3D IC test. The major 
differences include power distribution network 
(PDN), clock tree, and scan test architecture, and 
these differences may affect the test cost and 
correctness of test results. In this research project, 
we will study these test challenges in 3D IC 
testing, and look for ways to solve such 
problems. Our goal is to provide the same level 
of test quality in pre-bond tests and post-bond 
system test under test-pin-count constraint. To 
achieve this goal, the following topics will be 
addressed: (1) delay fault testing in pre-bond test, 
and (2) TSV testing method in low-cost 3D IC 
testing environment. 
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) 
has been proposed for more than two decades. 
However, this technology generated little 
interests in the past, as Moore’s law has been the 
Therefore, the modified test architecture shown 
in Fig. 1(b) is assumed. In this architecture, 
primary input vectors are loaded into an extra PI 
chain through SPI port, while test results are 
captured into the PO chain and unloaded through 
SPO port. 
It is assumed that LOC test is applied. The 
main difference between the proposed method 
and normal scan test architecture is that the 
primary input vectors also have to be loaded 
through scan shift operations. As a result, there 
are only two types of acceptable primary input 
vectors in a delay test: (1) p1 = p2, and (2) p2 is a 
1-bit shift of p1. In the second case, p2 is 
obtained in the same ways as LOS test. 
In an LOS test, the scan chains have to be 
switched from shift mode to capture mode in the 
capture cycle, which requires the scan enable 
(SE) signal to change state within a system clock 
cycle. Fortunately, in the proposed hybrid test 
scheme it is not necessary to flip SE in a system 
clock cycle. The reason is that PI chain does not 
capture response in the test process, so it is kept 
in the shift mode during a test. In contrast, PO 
chain is kept in the capture mode during test, 
which implies SE signal in the PO chain is also 
fixed in the test process. Therefore, the hardware 
overhead of the hybrid scheme is close to LOC 
test even though LOS operations are used. 
IR-Drop Aware Test Scheme: The amount of 
power consumed in the launch cycle is roughly 
proportional to the number scan flip-flops that 
change states in the launch cycle. In order to 
reduce power consumption, we need to reduce 
the Hamming distance between the two test 
vectors V1=p1s1 and V2=p2s2. In the proposed 
method, we shall try to reduce the Hamming 
distance between state vectors s1 and s2 by 
modifying the architecture of internal scan 
chains. The internal scan chains are divided into 
several groups whose clocks can be gated 
individually. Scan flip-flops will capture circuit 
responses in the launch and capture cycles only 
if their clocks are enabled in the test process. 
The scenario is shown in Fig. 2, where 
shadowed blocks indicating scan flip-flops 
whose clocks are disabled in the test process. 
This modified scan test architecture provides two 
advantages over the traditional method: (1) test 
power can be reduced as the Hamming distance 
between s1 and s2 is decreased, and (2) more 
possible two-pattern tests can be applied, as s2 is 
not necessarily the captured response of applying 
V1 in this case. It is assumed that the disabled 
scan chains will not capture response in launch 
and capture cycles so that the clocks do not have 
to be enabled within a single clock cycle. 
Therefore, errors must be propagated to either 
the PO chain or the same group of scan flip-flops 
to be observable, as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Scan chain clock gating. 
In order to apply the proposed scheme, we 
need to provide an automatic test pattern test 
generation (ATPG) tool as well as a way to 
partition scan cells to achieve the maximum 
power reduction. Details of the algorithms can 
be found in [3]. 
 
3.2 Low-Cost TSV Testing 
A possible way to reduce hardware 
overhead is to reuse functional FFs for TSV 
testing [2]. Inserting wrapper cells at both ends 
of TSVs enhances testability in two ways. (1) In 
pre-bond test, they replace TSVs and provide 
controllability and observability. (2) They are 
used to test TSVs in post-bond test. The wrapper 
cells are not useful in either system-level 
function test. In order to restrict hardware cost 
for DFT the functionality of wrapper cells for 
TSVs can be replaced by internal scan flip-flops 
in pre-bond test. In a two-die 3D-IC, if both dies 
are pre-bond testable without the wrapper cells, 
TSV faults can be detected by system-level test 
and the wrapper cells are not really necessary. 
The low-cost DFT scheme reuses PIs/PPIs in 
pre-bond test to achieve cost reduction [2].

Set up 
If a TSV fault cannot be detected by a given 
set of pre-bond test patterns, an extra test pattern 
has to be generated. Let TSVk be an outgoing 
TSV from Die i to Die i–1. The ATPG process 
for a fault on TSVk is outlined as follows [4]. 
 Configure Die i in pre-bond test mode 
and Die i–1 in normal mode. Combine 
these two dies into a single logic 
circuit C, in which all TSVs become 
internal wires. 
 Assign the target fault to TSVk. 
 Carry out TPG for circuit C. 
 
3.3 Experimental Results 
Low-Power Pre-bond Test: We have carried out 
experiments on the proposed low-power test 
scheme with benchmark circuits from ISCAS’89 
and ITC’99 suites. Statistics of the circuits are 
given in TABLE I, where the numbers of gates, 
primary inputs, primary outputs, and flip-flops 
are shown.

The transition fault model is used in our 
experiment. The effects of adding PI and PO 
chains are shown in TABLE II. In this 
experiment, two circuits are realized for each 
benchmark: one has PI & PO chains and the 
other has none. LOC test patterns are generated 
by TetraMax; the results, including the number 
of test pattern (#TP) and fault coverage (FC), are 
provided in the table. Columns two and three are 
results for transitional approach (i.e., without PI 
and PO chains), while columns four and five 
show results of circuits with PI and PO chains. 
The last two columns compare these two 
architectures. The results show that, on the 
average, the coverage is decreased by 2.44% 
while the pattern count increased by 1.08%. The 
fault coverage is lower because the 
controllability of PI vectors is significantly 
reduced due to the test pad constraint in 
pre-bond test.

TABLE III evaluates the effectiveness of 
the proposed in terms of the Hamming distance 
(HD) between initialization vector (V1) and 
activation vector (V2). Columns two and three 
give the maximum HD and average HD in each 
circuit assuming no clock gating is available, 
while columns four and five show the maximum 
HD and average HD in circuits with clock gating. 
The last three columns compare the two 
implementations. On the average, the maximum 
and average Hamming distances are reduced by 
48.88% and 62.91%, respectively. The drawback 
of the proposed method is that the pattern count 
is 1.88x higher. The main reason is that two tests 
can be merged only if the same set of partitions 
is disabled; as a result, test compaction is less 
effective in when clock gating is used. 
TABLE IV evaluates power reduction in 
terms by using weighted switching activity 
(WSA) of the circuit. The overall WSA is 
obtained by adding the WSA of all applied test 
patterns. The reduction of WSA is lower than 
that of Hamming distance as the power 
remains undetectable after Stage 1, Stage 2 TPG 
is executed for the fault, and the results are 
summarized in Table VI. Two rows are given for 
each circuit; the first row (#Det) shows the 
number of detected faults, while the second row 
(FC) gives the fault coverage in percentage. 
Results of Stage 1, Stage 2, and overall ATPG 
process are given in columns three to eight, 
respectively. For example, all 56 faults on 
outgoing TSVs in D1 or S13207 are detectable 
by pre-bond test vectors; hence, #Det is 56/56 
and fault coverage is 100% in Stage 1. Since all 
faults are detected, Stage 2 ATPG is not carried 
out; thus the corresponding entries are marked 
by “-”. 
If there are undetectable TSV faults after 
Stage 2 ATPG, DFT insertion is deployed. In 
only two cases there are undetectable faults after 
Stage 2 (S38584 and b17), and the reason is that 
the fault coverage of the two circuits are not 
100% in the first place. Stage 2 TPG is not 
executed in five out of the nine circuits. A few 
TSV faults require Stage 2 TPG in two other 
cases (S13207 and b22). The results show that 
most of the TSV faults can be detected by 
pre-bond test patterns. 
Table VII shows the number of test patterns 
applied in each stage.

四、 結論與討論 
In this project we have developed two 
techniques for 3D IC testing: a low-power delay 
test method targeted pre-bond test with limited 
supplied power, and a low-cost TSV testing 
architecture. 
The low-power test architecture has been 
presented in ISCAS 2012 [3], and we will 
prepare a complete version and submit a journal. 
A preliminary version of the los-cost TSV testing 
scheme has been presented in VTTW 2012 [4], 
and the final version has been submitted to 
VLSI-DAT 2013.

Due to limited test pads available in pre-bond tests, it is 
not possible to apply primary input vectors directly through 
primary inputs. Therefore, the modified test architecture 
shown in Fig. 1(b) is assumed in this paper. In the proposed 
architecture, primary input vectors are loaded into an extra PI 
chain through SPI port, while test results are captured into the 
PO chain and unloaded through SPO port. 
 
Figure 1.  (a) scan base architecture (b) proposed pre-bond test architecture. 
B. Hybrid At-speed Test Scheme 
It is assumed that LOC test is applied in this paper, as this 
method is more popular in practice. The main difference 
between the proposed method and normal scan test 
architecture is that the primary input vectors also have to be 
loaded through scan shift operations. As a result, there are 
only two types of acceptable primary input vectors in a delay 
test: (1) p1 = p2, and (2) p2 is a 1-bit shift of p1. In the second 
case, p2 is obtained in the same ways as LOS test; therefore, 
the proposed test method is actually a hybrid version of LOC 
and LOS test. 
In an LOS test, the scan chains have to be switched from 
shift mode to capture mode in the capture cycle, which 
requires the scan enable (SE) signal to change state within a 
system clock cycle. As a result, the global SE signal has to be 
specially treated to achieve this goal. Fortunately, in the 
proposed hybrid test scheme it is not necessary to flip SE in a 
system clock cycle. The reason is that PI chain does not 
capture response in the test process, so it is kept in the shift 
mode during a test. In contrast, PO chain is kept in the capture 
mode during test, which implies SE signal in the PO chain is 
also fixed in the test process. Therefore, the hardware 
overhead of the hybrid scheme is close to LOC test even 
though LOS operations are used in the PI chain. 
 
III. IR-DROP AWARE TEST SCHEME 
Test power has to be applied through a limited number of 
test pads in pre-bond test, and the locations of these pads are 
different from the locations of power TSVs used in the normal 
operations. As a result, the IR-drop issue should be carefully 
considered in the pre-bond test. A plausible way to achieve 
this goal is to reduce power consumption in the launch cycle. 
In this paper, we present a low-power test architecture targeted 
to reduce switching activities in the launch cycle, which can 
alleviate the IR-drop issue in pre-bond test. 
A. Clock Gating of Internal Scan Chains 
The amount of power consumed in the launch cycle is 
roughly proportional to the number scan flip-flops that change 
states in the launch cycle. In order to reduce power 
consumption, we need to reduce the Hamming distance 
between the two test vectors V1=p1s1 and V2=p2s2. In the 
proposed method, we shall try to reduce the Hamming 
distance between state vectors s1 and s2 by modifying the 
architecture of internal scan chains. The internal scan chains 
are divided into several groups whose clocks can be gated 
individually. Scan flip-flops will capture circuit responses in 
the launch and capture cycles only if their clocks are enabled 
in the test process. 
The scenario is shown in Fig. 2, where shadowed blocks 
indicating scan flip-flops whose clocks are disabled in the test 
process. This modified scan test architecture provides two 
advantages over the traditional method: (1) test power can be 
reduced as the Hamming distance between s1 and s2 is 
decreased, and (2) more possible two-pattern tests can be 
applied, as s2 is not necessarily the captured response of 
applying V1 in this case. It is assumed that the disabled scan 
chains will not capture response in launch and capture cycles 
so that the clocks do not have to be enabled within a single 
clock cycle. Therefore, errors must be propagated to either the 
PO chain or the same group of scan flip-flops to be observable, 
as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
Figure 2.  Scan chain clock gating. 
B. Hybrid At-speed Test Scheme 
Fig. 3 shows the circuit implementation of the proposed 
clock gating scheme where the internal scan chains are 
divided into four groups. Each partition may contain one or 
more scan chains; for simplicity, it is assumed that each 
partition consists of a single scan chain in Fig. 3. The 
proposed scheme introduces an extra Decision Chain that 
contains control signals for clock gating. The clock signal of a 
partition is disabled in a test only if SE is not asserted and the 
corresponding control signal is 0. In the example shown in Fig. 
3, only Chain 2 is enabled in the test. The control signals are 
scanned into Decision Chain through DI port. 
 
IV. TEST PATTERN GENERATOR 
The test generation process of the proposed scheme is 
outlined in Fig. 4 assuming that partitions of scan flip-flops 
are known. The scan chain partition algorithm will be 
presented in the next section. Details of the main steps are 
discussed as follows.

Hamming distance as the power consumption may be affected 
by other factors. Still, a 40% reduction in average WSA can 
be achieved. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
Ａ hybrid test architecture targeting for low-power delay 
test is presented. The proposed test architecture can effectively 
control the IR-drop problem in pre-bond test for 3D ICs; 
besides, it can also be applied to 2D circuits.
