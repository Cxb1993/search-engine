1 Introductions and Litera-
ture Review
Design is a multiobjective decision-making pro-
cess considering manufacturing, cost, aesthetics,
usability and many other product attributes. Of-
ten time decisions have to be made under various
operating and environmental uncertainties. This
research investigates solutions to biobjective opti-
mization problems under uncertainties quantified
as random design variables and/or random pa-
rameters. Equation (1) is the generalized biobjec-
tive optimization under uncertainty formulation
with objectives f = {f1, f2} that are functions of
the means of random variables only. Constraints
are formulated probabilistically with failure prob-
abilities being less than or equal to Pf . Constraint
reliabilities are therefore (1− Pf). All uncertain-
ties X are assumed to be Gaussian with means
µX as design variables and standard deviations
σX as fixed constants. In this problem setup, we
consider deterministic variables x as a special case
with zero variance. Deterministic constraint that
are not functions of random variables are consid-
ered as a special case with Pf being zero. All X
are uncorrelated with each other and all equality
constraints are implicitly removed with K being
the constraint set.

Values of the failure probability Pf in Eq.(1)
affect directly on the feasible space of Eq.(1), and
consequently change the optimal solutions. Let F
be the deterministic feasible space of constraints
g ≤ 0 and the mapping of F to the object space
forms the attainable set A.
Definition 1.1. Consider two design points xi,
xj in F . We say xi dominates xj if and only if
fk(xi) < fk(xj)∀k. (2)
If the set of all xi in F satisfying Eq.(2) is null,
we say xj is a non-dominated design. Let the
mapping of xi and xj to the object space be fi
and fj, respectively. The subset of A with all
non-dominated solutions forms the Pareto set, de-
noted as P . f∗ represents points on the Pareto
set.
Definition 1.2. A probabilistic feasible space
Fp(Pf), defined as Eq.(3), is the space of all µX
satisfying the probabilistic constrain in Eq.(1).
Fp(Pf) = {µX ∈ Rn : Pr[gj(X) > 0] ≤ Pf ∀j ∈ K, X ∼ N(µX,σ2X)}
(3)
Definition 1.3. A β-Pareto set Pβ is the set of
all Pareto at different Pf values.
Research about β-Pareto set exists in the liter-
ature. Li et al. used a multiobjective framework
to study the relations between manufacturing cost
and dimensional variations in multistation assem-
bly processes [1] and the effects of manufacturing
variations in fuel injector on engine emissions [2].
Results of β-Pareto sets at different uncertainty
levels (dimensional tolerance and manufacturing
variations, respectively) were presented. Levi and
coworkers generated β-Pareto set of a cantilever
beam with respect to buckling under material un-
certainties [3]. In [4], Singh and Minsker investi-
gated the simultaneous effects of uncertainty on
the cost and residual of different groundwater re-
mediation design.
Similar studies also exist in the literature as
stochastic multiobjective programming (SMP)
problems; for example, see [5–7]. Rommelfanger
used both random and fuzzy concepts to model
uncertainties in SMP by converting multiple ob-
jectives into a single objective problem using
weighted sum [8]. Tonon et al. also considered
SMP with both random and fuzzy uncertainties
in tunnel design [9]. In their work, and many
others in the SMP literature, probabilistic con-
straints are converted into equivalent determin-
istic ones such that standard deterministic op-
timization techniques can be applied. In addi-
tion, only parameter uncertainties are considered
in SMP and the solution approaches are mainly
focused on constructing Pareto set with known
uncertainties at a specified reliability level.
Although these research obtained the β-Pareto
set under various uncertainty levels or at different
Pf values, generating these β-Pareto sets is time
consuming. Figure 1 shows the approach used in
current literatures to generate β-Pareto set. After
a Pf value is known, the Pareto set P with re-
spect to the Pf is generated. Standard approaches
in generating a Pareto set involves finding a fi-
nite number of non-dominant design points via
weighted sum [10] or constraint method [11] and
then connect these non-dominant design to be the
2
design vector µX, Gj in Eq.(4) has the same feasi-
bility information as the probabilistic constraint.
Gj(µX) ≡ Pr[gj(X) > 0]− Pf,j (4)
Hence, Gj is a deterministic equivalent con-
straint function that can be used to represent
the activity of the probabilistic constraint func-
tion Pr[gj(X) > 0]− Pf,j. Assuming Gj is a con-
tinuous, differentiable function, the definitions in
Table 1 can be extended simply by replacing gj
with Gj.
2.2 Relations between Fp and Pf
Theorem 1. Let Pf,i and Pf,j be different failure
probability values in Eq.(1) and the correspond-
ing probabilistic feasible space be Fp,i and Fp,j,
respectively. With the increase of reliability re-
quirements, hence the decrease of Pf values, Fp
shrinks as stated in Eq.(5).
Pf,i ≤ Pf,j ⇒ Fp,i ⊆ Fp,j (5)
Proof. Denote g′i and g
′
j as the active constraints
of Eq.(1) with failure probability being Pf,i and
Pf,j, respectively. Let the corresponding deter-
ministic constraints set Ki = Kj. Fp,i
⋂Fp,j =
Fp,i or Fp,j. Let us now proof Theorem 1 by con-
tradiction. Assume there exist Pf,i and Pf,j such
that Fp,i ⊃ Fp,j. In optimization theory a larger
feasible space will yield a better solution than a
smaller one; therefore
max {Pr[gj(X(µX)) > 0],∀µX ∈ Fp,i} ≥ max {Pr[gj(X(µX)) > 0],∀µX ∈ Fp,j} .
(6)
Equation (6) also implies Pf,i ≥ Pf,i, which
contradict our initial statement in Eq.(5). In
addition, for cases which Fp,i
⋂Fp,j = ∅ or
Fp,i
⋂Fp,j 6= Fp,i or Fp,j, the initial assumptions
are violated. Thus the proof of Theorem 1.
2.3 Linear Constraint Boundary
Shift under Random Uncer-
tainties
Uncertainties in Eq.(13) result in probabilistic
constraints as in Eq.(12). Since we only consider
X with Gaussian distributions, a linear constraint
gj(X) = A
T
j X − b will also be Gaussian with
mean µgj and variance σ
2
gj
where
µgj = A
T
j µX − b, (7)
σ2gj =
n∑
i=1
(
∂gj
∂xi
∣∣∣∣
µX
)2
· σ2Xi
The probabilistic linear constraint can then be
written as the deterministic constraint gj with a
deviation ∆j, or as an equivalent deterministic
constraint Gj in Eq.(8) where ∆j = σgjΦ(1−Pf,j).
Pr[gj(X) > 0] ≤ Pf
⇒ Φ (µgj/σgj)− Pf ≤ 0
⇒ µgj − σgj · Φ−1(Pf) ≤ 0 (8)
⇒ gj(µX) + ∆j ≤ 0
≡ Gj(µX) ≤ 0
Theorem 2. Constraint deviations ∆ in Eq.(8)
due to Pf result in a constant shift to the Pareto
set P if constraint activity remains unchanged.
Proof. Let us now compare the Pareto frontiers
along the active constraints g and the probabilis-
tic active constraint g′ of the same active set G.
The vertex of the active set G is the solution of
the simultaneous equations as shown in Eq.(9).
x∗k = {g : ATx− b = 0, g ∈ G} (9)
Assuming the active set remains unchanged, the
vertex of the β-Pareto is x′∗k such that
x′∗k = {g′ : ATx− b + ∆ = 0, g′ ∈ G}
The shift of constraint boundaries result in the
vector
dx = xk − x′k
= A−1b−A−1(b−∆)
= A−1∆ (10)
If we transfer the constraint shift to the effect of
the objective space, we can obtain the following :
df = f
′ − f
= CTx′∗k −CTx∗k
= CTA−1∆. (11)
Theorem 3. Without changing constraint activ-
ity, the shift of P is proportional to (−Φ−1(1−Pf))
Proof. ∆ in Eq.(11) is proportional to (−Φ−1(1−
Pf)) based on Eq.(8). The shift of Pareto df in
Eq.(11) is therefore proportional to (−Φ−1(1 −
Pf)).

points f1 and f2 in P such that f¯ = αf1+(1−α)f2
for some α, 0 < α < 1.
Definition 3.4. For a k × h matrix M denote
the set of indices of the columns of M by IdM .
Hence if M = (m1,m2, · · · ,mh) then IdM =
(1, 2, · · · , h) [14]. For a matrix M we define the
positive cone spanned by the columns of M as :
cone(M) = cone
(
mi : i ∈ IdM
)
=
{
m ∈ Rk : m =
∑
i∈IdM
αim
i, αi ≥ 0
}
Definition 3.5. A frame, F , of cone M is a col-
lection of columns of M such that cone(mi : i ∈
IdF ) = cone(M) and for each j ∈ IdF , we have
cone(mi : i ∈ IdF \ {j}) 6= cone(M) [14]
The method starts by generating extreme
points of the Pareto frontier as the initial non-
dominant design, and then finding new vertexes
of the Pareto frontier from known extreme points
until all extreme points are reached. Dauer and
Lin have shown that an edge of the feasible design
space will map to an edge of the attainable set in
the object space if and only if the edge is a frame
vector. Figure 3 illustrates the solution concept
using a bi-objective linear problem. In what fol-
lows, we will define a Pareto set of MOLP via its
vertexes as :
P = {f¯1, f¯2, · · · , f¯nv} (15)
where nv is the number of vertexes. As can be
seen, the non-dominated solutions of the attain-
able set form the Pareto. Two extreme points, f∗1
and f∗2 are obtained, with one being selected as
the starting point to construct the entire Pareto
frontier. Constraint activity at the selected ex-
treme point, y¯1, is used to construct a reduced
cost matrix R. Elements of R are the vectors
from y¯’s mapping to the adjacent vertex in the de-
sign space, denoted as possible moving direction.
Boundaries of R constitute the frame of possible
moving directions that are obtained using a frame
algorithm. Once the frame of R is available, the
one that satisfies Pareto frontier definition can
soon be determined, shown as θ in Fig.3. The
largest step length in the given Pareto frame di-
rection is calculated by an optimization subprob-
lem as ‖θ‖. The new vertex in the Pareto frontier
is then f¯2 = f¯1 + θ. f¯2 is then used as the new
extreme point in finding the next vertex until f∗2
is reached. Detail procedures in each step of the
Pareto frontier construction is as follows.

Step 1. Generate extreme points
In this step Eq.(13) is considered as a col-
lection of single-objective linear problems in
Eq.(16) where ck is the cost vector of the kth
objective, C = [c1, c2]. Equation (16) can be
solved using Simplex. Let the optimum be
x∗k. f
∗
k = [f1(x
∗
k), f2(x
∗
k)] will be one extreme
point in the Pareto frontier. Since we focus
on biobjective problems only, one should ob-
tain two extreme points as [f∗1 , f
∗
2 ].

Step 2. Build reduced cost matrix
Once extreme points are found in Step 1,
the corresponding active constraint set Kk
for the kth objective in Eq.(16) is also know.
An extreme point is selected as the starting
point to Pareto frontier construction with the
base variables being xbk. The matrices A and
C are then decomposed according to the base
variables as Eq.(17).

The reduce cost coefficient R that contains
vectors of all directions from x∗k to adjacent
vertexes in the design space is then build us-
ing Eq.(18). Rank of R equals to the problem
dimensions n.

point Gj can be approximated locally using the
first order reliability method [16]. As noted, the
true λ is only computed at the optimum, and so
the Lagrange multipliers are only estimates in the
intermediate iterations. In an active set strategy,
as k → ∞ (or in practice as iterations proceed),
µkX → µ∗X, the multiplier estimates approach the
true ones, λk → λ∗, and the working set Gk be-
comes the true active set G∗.
Although Table 1 presents several refined ac-
tivity definitions, identifying these in algorith-
mic procedures is not practical, and algorithms
using multipliers and function values will sepa-
rate only strongly active constraints from inactive
ones. This is sufficient for most engineering ap-
plications and is assumed to be the case here as
well.
Lemma 1. The change of F due to Pf can be
observed from the vertex in the design space
Proof. This can be proved by contradiction such
that if a feasible space is altered without chang-
ing any vertexes, F will not be a polyhedral.
Therefore violates the basic principle of LP prob-
lems.
Lemma 2. The change of P due to Pf can be
observed from the vertex in the object space
Proof. When the change of F be mapped onto
the object space, one of the following cases will
occur.
• The new vertexes do not change P , then the
corner points of P will not have any effects.
• The vertexes map on P as corner points.
• The vertexes map on P as segments between
corner points.
• The vertexes map on P as
From all the cases, we can see that judging from
corner points will ensure obtain the correct infor-
mation of constraint activity change.
The theorem 3.1 in [14] shows that the edge in
a design space will be mapped as an edge in the
corresponding object space only if the vector is in
the frame. In this work we extend the concept and
connect the shifted vertexes to obtain the shifted
edge in the Pareto set in the object space. By
combining Lemma 1 and 2, one can easily show
Theorem 4 as follows:
Theorem 4. For an LP problem, any change in
constraint activity can be observed at the vertex
In this research, we use Theorem 4 in determin-
ing the critical failure probability level P ′f that
changes the active constraint set as the solution
to Eq.(23) where λf,j is the Lagrange multiplier
for constraint gj at a given failure probability level
Pf . This method only require the Lagrange mul-
tipliers at the vertexes.

4 Multiobjective Nonlinear
Programming under Un-
certainty
The β-Pareto set generated via the approach in
Section 3 is exact for MOLP problems. However,
this method faces several challenges for multi-
objective nonlinear programming (MONLP)
problems under uncertainty; including :
i). Deterministic Pareto set of a MONLP prob-
lem does not have exact forms. Only limited
number of Pareto points are available in gen-
eral engineering practices;
ii). The constraint activities in MONLP is much
more complex and the theorems in predict-
ing constraint boundaries shift for MOLP
might not be applicable;
iii). When constraints are nonlinear, using the
first order concept in estimating constraint
boundaries shift might not be accurate.
To extend the method for LP problems to NLP,
we assume that MONLP problems can be ap-
proximated by a finite set of MOLP problems.
In other words, the attainable set of an MONLP
problem A is the sum of the attainable sets Aˆk
of finite MOLP subproblems as in Eq.(24). If the
MONLP is highly nonlinear, one needs to use a
large number of subset Aˆk to ensure accuracy.
A ≈
∑
∀k
Aˆk (24)
Equation (24) is used in approximating a Pareto
set (P) via a finite set of linear segments (Pˆk)
such that P ≈

segments based on the np Pareto points available.
The upper and lower bounds approximation of a
Pareto set in [17] starts by connecting optimal
point of each objective function to form a two
dimensional hyperplane. Let the Pareto set be
partitioned into n segments. We have the upper
bound function ui of the ith segment as:
ui = f
i
2+
f i+12 − f i2
f i+11 − f i1
(f1−f i1), ∀f1 ∈ [f i1, f i+11 ] (26)
Define ei =
f i+12 −f i2
f i+11 −f i1
as the slope of the upper
bound function. The lower bound function li can
then be found as the function parallel to ui with
the maximal distance between them while remain
in contact with at least one Pareto point. Equa-
tion (27) shows the concept where f i′1 is the tan-
gent point of the function li to the Pareto set.
li = f
i′
2 + ei(f1 − f i′1 ) (27)
where f i′1 = arg min{f2 − eif1,∀f i1 ≤ f1 ≤ f i+11 }
The upper and lower bound approximations, ui
and li, contain the true Pareto. The more Pareto
points available, the higher accuracy this approx-
imations can be. The maximal number of seg-
ment is np while the minimal is 1. However, one
might want to have a smaller segmentation for ef-
ficiency purpose. The distance between ui and li
is therefore the index for approximation accuracy,
denoted as Es.
In this study, we use the values of one objec-
tive within ui and li to be the measure of Pareto
approximation error. For a bi-objective problem,
Eq.(28) uses the values of f2 within the bounds,
∆f2, as the error of the sandwich approximation
in Fig.6. If the objective function variation is not
acceptable, more linear segments should be added
until ∆f2 ≤ Es where Es is a predetermined ac-
ceptable error level.
∆f2 = max
i
{ui(f i′1 )− li(f i′1 )} (28)
4.2 Linear Subproblems in Pareto
Approximation
The attainable set of the original nonlinear prob-
lem is approximated as the sum of finite linear at-
tainable sets as in Eq.(24). The sandwich method
in Section 4.1 helps us identify number of lin-
ear sets in approximating the Pareto. The cor-
responding linear subproblems in each attainable
set approximate will be obtained in this section.
Let f ′ be the linearization point in the object
space. In this step we try to map this linear point
to the design space and find the corresponding lin-
ear boundaries of active constraints. The linear
point in the design space, x′, can be found via
using constraint method in the object space. In
Fig.6 we have f ′i as the linear segments in the ob-
ject space, the corresponding linear design point
x′ can then be found as the solution to :
min
x
f2(x) (29)
s.t. f1(x) = f
′i
1
∀x ∈ F
Once the linearization point in the design space
(x′) is found, the corresponding linear program-
ming (LP) subproblem with respect to x′ can be
obtained as :
LP(x′) :
{
min
x
fˆ(x) = CTf x
s.t. F ′ = {gˆ = ATx ≤ B,ga = ATax ≤ Ba}
where CTf = ∇f |x=x′ , AT = ∇g|x=x′ , B =
g|x=x′ − ∇g|x=x′ · x′. The feasible space F ′ in
LP(x′) considers not only the linearization of the
original constraints, gˆ, but also auxiliary con-
straints, denoted as ga, to ensure design will
not go beyond the extreme points in the original
Pareto. These auxiliary constraints ensure design
to match the original extreme conditions, thus
improving the accuracy of the Pareto set approx-
imation. Aa and Ba are obtained via identifying
the extreme points x∗ in the design space and
linearize the constraints at these points. There-
fore Aa = ∇g|x=x∗ , Ba = g|x=x∗ −∇g|x=x∗ · x∗.
Table ?? lists the results of two LP subproblems
generated at two break points f ′1 and f ′2.
4.3 Approximate β-Pareto Set
The solutions to each MOLP subproblem is then
obtained using the method describe in Section 3.
Different from LP case, the minimal failure prob-
ability a Pareto set can shift not only depends on
constraint activities, but also depends on the ac-
curacy of the shift. This is calculated via compar-
ing the true Pareto point using constrain method
with the Pareto approximate when all objective
functions are fixed but one as shown in Eq.(30).
The objective function in Eq.(30) is to obtain the
maximum reliability (minimal failure probability)

The initial lateral velocity of the 950 kilogram
moving deformable barrier (MDB) in vehicle side
crash test is at 56 kilometers per hour. A ve-
hicle must meet internal and regulated side im-
pact requirements specific to the vehicle market.
In this work the European Enhanced Vehicle-
Safety Committee (EEVC) side impact procedure
is adapted. Several dummy safety performance is
used as the criteria for occupant safety under side
impact including head injury criterion (HIC), ab-
domen load (g1), rib deflections (upper g2, middle
g3, lower g4) and viscous criterion (upper g5, mid-
dle g6, lower g7), pubic symphysis force (g8), and
the velocity of B-pillar at the middle point (g9).
5.2 Results and Discussions
The β-Pareto set of the the biobjective optimiza-
tion problem in Eq.(31) is obtained using the pro-
posed method with Es = 0.01 and Ep = 0.2%.
50 Pareto points on the deterministic Pareto set
are first obtained using the constraint method.
With the given Es, this deterministic Pareto set
is approximated using three linear segments with
corresponding break points being [24.25, 15.06],
[32.94, 13.45], and [34.09 13.45], respectively. The
resulting Pareto approximation Pˆ0 is listed in Ta-
ble 8. Although from these data, one can see
the failure probability limit without constraint
activity change is 1%, the nonlinearity in con-
straints restricts the shift of deterministic Pareto
to Pf = 14%.
The proposed method needs to be repeated
again with Pareto points at Pf = 14% identi-
fied using the constraint method. Four new lin-
ear segments are obtained to meet the Es re-
quirement with break points being [24.95, 15.04],
[25.77, 14.46], [31.25, 13.80], and [34.09, 13.54].
The Pareto approximation Pˆ1 is listed in Table
8. Within the Ep requirement, the β-Pareto set
up to Pf = 1% can be obtained.
Figure 8 compares the β-Pareto set of the ve-
hicle crashworthiness study using the proposed
method (solid lines) with validation using con-
straint method (?). As can be seen the proposed
method is able to capture the Pareto set with
high accuracy with a significant efficiency im-
provement. Another important feature using the
proposed method is that predictions between ob-
jective tradeoffs at untested Pf values can quickly
be obtained without running optimization. For
example, if a designer would like to know the
tradeoff between weight and door intrusion veloc-
ity at 95% reliability level (Pf=0.05), he can sim-
ply use Pˆ1 and Pˆ2 and then we have the Pareto
approximate at Pf = 5% as :

6 Concluding Remarks
Design under uncertainty is a field with growing
interest that studies practical engineering prob-
lems in an analytical manner. In this work we
extend the field of design under uncertainty to
multiple objectives. An exact β-Pareto set gener-
ating method is proposed for multiobjective lin-
ear programming problems. By identifying ex-
treme point on the Pareto set and subsequently
calculating the vertexes, the exact Pareto set of
the MOLP can be obtained. The entire β-Pareto
set at all Pf values can then be constructed by
calculating Pareto set shift at various reliability

本日主要行程有三：主持研討會及報告研究論文
	 
 8 
法被轉換的，我們開發的方法利用傳統的縮減梯度方法(reduced	 
gradient)並加入取樣點的排序，有效的提升計算等式限制式的速度，
已可立即與其他不等式計算方式結合，解決工程上可靠度最佳化的問
題。	 
8月17日 
本日主要行程有：報告研究論文，及與他校教授討論合作事宜。	 
本日報告之論文是洪子頡同學的碩士論文︽該研究的主要目的是提供
一個有系統的方法解決多目標設計下公差配置的問題︽除此之外︽本
研究更將該方法延伸至複雜系統的工程問題︽使的設計與公差配置可
以推廣至多目標的實際範例〈 
此外︽研討會的許多研究均與本實驗室相關︽以下將部分較有收穫的
報告簡列如下 
DAC 23-1 Design and Optimization of Sustainable Energy Systems 
• An extended pattern search approach to wind farm layout 
optimization by Dupont and Cagan 
該研究主要找尋最佳的風力發電配置︽每個葉片均有最佳的執
行範圍︽但也會影像的流場︽因而改變周遭葉片的效率︽因此
風力發電場的葉片擺設需要經過嚴密的計算〈 
• A MINLP model for global optimization of plug-in hybrid vehicle 
design and allocation to minimize life cycle greenhouse gas 
 10 
 
8月18日 
• 本日除參加研討會外︽也參加設計自動化委員會議。 機械自動
化委員會為機械設計最早成立的委員會之一︽申請者詹魁元自
學生時代便積極參與委員會的運作︽一直到加入成功大學之
後︽逐漸成為該委員會的亞洲代表之一︽也是國際聯絡人〈附
件為美國機械工程師協會提供的感謝狀〈 
• 以下擷取本日所聆聽的報告較有心得 
DAC 27-3 Simulation-based design under uncertainty 
• Validating Design through sequential simulation-based 
optimization 
為避免最佳化之結果與現實之差距︽該研究適當的使用實際量
測結果來驗證每個最佳化迴圈的更新步伐︽若是該步伐超出原
驗證範圍︽則取其中點再加以更新︽反之則可忽略驗證步驟︽
讓演算法逐步找到有足夠經度的最佳值〈這個研究屬於新穎的
領域︽值得同再最佳化領域鑽研的學者討論〈 
• Investigating the significance of one-to-many mapping in 
multiobjective optimization 
多目標設計空間若要映射至設計空間︽往往產生一對多的問
題︽此研究之學者針對何時會產生一對多現象加以探討〈然而
