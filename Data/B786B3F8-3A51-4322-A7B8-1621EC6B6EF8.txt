 
Abstract 
 
In many activities, an individual must reach for and touch or grasp an object located in 
the environment. Individual’s activities must involve gathering information from the 
environment and using it to visually guide movements towards a certain target. Therefore, the 
issuse concerning the poiting or reaching for visually impaired seems to be more studied. 
Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of characteristics of pointing 
movement on designing product for the visually impaired, myopia, and sighted subject. 
Experiment 1 was conducted to explore the effects of characteristics of target and presented 
direction on goal-directed pointing performance through a computer screen. Participants need 
to move the cursor on a target as quickly and accurately as possible, and then they had to 
press the button on the computer mouse using the index finger to disappear the target. Results 
showed that the main effects of subject group, diameter of target, spacing between targets, and 
luminance of target/background on aiming time were significant. Moreover, three two-way 
interactions were found, including interactive effect between the diameter of target and 
subject group, between subject group and luminance of target, and between subject group and 
spacing between targets. 
Experiment 2 was designed to investigate the effects of background light color and 
movement distance on reaching time varying reminding signal. Participants were asked to 
move their index finger to the illuminated target and press it to extinguish the target as quickly 
and accuracy as possible once target illuminated. Analysis showed that the main effect of 
subject group, color of interfered light, movement distance, and type of reminding signal on 
reaching time were significant. In addition, the two-way interactive effects between color of 
interfered light and subject group, between color of interfered light and type of reminding 
signal, and between movement distance and type of reminding signal were found. 
The purpose of Experiment 3 was to examine the effects of illumination, source of cue, 
and target direction on pointing performance. Participants were instructed to point the 
illuminated target with their index finger as quickly and accuracy as possible once the target 
illuminated. Results revealed that the effects of subject group, target direction, and source of 
cue on error of pointing angle were significant. In addition, three two-way interactive effects 
were found, including interaction of illumination and source of cue, target direction and 
subject group, and target direction and source of cue.  
These results can help the visually impaired to understand the nature of the disability by 
thoroughly studying the nature of the goal-directed aiming and have implications for the 
design of product for the visually impaired.

(Fitts, 1954; Augustyn & Roscnbaum, 2005). Some researches have shown that Fitts’s law 
arises from the motor system optimizing movement trajectories to minimize movement time 
in the presence of neuromotor noise (Harris and Wolpert 1998; Meyer et al. 1988; Tanaka et al. 
2006). These studies suggest that the motor system determines the minimum movement time 
based on the target’s width, before the movement even starts, and then chooses the optimal 
motor commands to build the required trajectory (Young, Pratt, & Chau, 2008). Other 
constraints known to affect pointing performance are the orientation of the movement in the 
workspace (Fernandez & Bootsma, 2004; MacKenzie & Buxton, 1992; Whisenand & 
Emurian, 1999) and properties of the graphieal interface such as the control display gain 
(MacKenzie & Riddersma, 1994). In recent years, with the increase in the use of computer 
displays and input devices (Thompson, McConnell, Slocum, & Bohan, 2007), for example, 
digitizing tablets, to investigate reaching performance, control display gain has been 
manipulated as a constraint on movement (MacKenzie & Riddcrsma, 1994). A common result 
is (hat overall movement duration varies sith C D gain (Bohan, McConnell, Thompson, & 
Chaparro, 2005; Van Doorn & Unema, 2005). A detailed kinematic analysis of discrete 
pointing movements made under varying gain settings rewa an effect similar to that of 
decreasing target size; the duration of the corrective suh-mowments increases with gain 
(Hohan, Thompson, & Samuelson, 2003).  
 
The vast majority of goal—directed reaching studies contrasting visually and 
memory-guided movements have done so in the context of a target presented in an otherwise 
neutral or empty visual background (Carlton, 1981; Elliott, 1988; Elliott & Madalena, 1987; 
Heath & Westwood, 2003; Heath, Westwood, & Binsted, 2004; Westwood, Heath, & Roy, 
2001, 2003). From this work, it has generally been shown that visually guided actions are 
more accurate and less variable than memory-guided ones (Elliott, Heath, Binsted, Ricker, 
Roy, & Chua, 1999; Flanders, Tillery, & Soechting, 1992; Heath et al.. 2004; McIntyre, 
Stratta, & Lacquaniti, 1998; Westwood et al., 2001). Presumably, that is because vision of the 
aiming environment (including limb and target) allow the performer to specify movement 
parameters in an egocentric visual frame of reference and evoke visually based limb/target 
amendments (Elliott, Hlelsen, & Chua, 2001).  
 
The mouse is the most common pointing device in everyday use (Bridger, 2009). 
Pointing at a target is a fundamental and frequent task in graphical user interfaces, so even a 
marginal improvement in pointing performance can have a large effect on a user’s 
productivity (Casiez, Vogel, Balakrishnan, & Cockburn, 2008). Although goal-directed 
pointing has been extensively studied in infants, adults (Bradshaw & Watt, 2002), and in older 
adults (Greenstein, 1997), few studies have investiagted pointing performance for the low 
vision (who is defined as visual acuity values between 20/60 and less than 3/60 by WHO, 
 3
addition, the visual acuity of the severe myopia group was obviously different from that of 
sighted subject group, however, the visual experience in everyday between severe myopia and 
sighted seemed to be the same.  
 
All participants were tested color vision based on the Ishihara color test plates. None of 
them have color deficiencies. The participants received a reward of 1800 New Taiwan dollars 
for their participation. 
 
Stimulus Materials and Design 
    The present experiment investigated four independent variables: diameter of target, 
target spacing, stimulus luminance, and presented direction. Five levels of diameter of target 
were used: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 cm. Two targets were presented on the screen 
simultaneously in a vertical or a horizontal direction. Three levels of spacing of inter-targets 
were used. There were 4, 8, and 12 cm, respectively. Targets were designed in a gray scale. 
Three kinds of target luminance were employed: lighter gray, gray, and darker gray. The color 
CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) coordinates values (L (cd/m2), x, y) for targets 
at lighter gray, gray, and darker gray were (7.6143, 0.3942, 0.2136), (3.3725, 0.3221, 0.2636), 
and (2.6733, 0.5411, 0.1221), respectively. 
 
      The mixed design consisted of diameter of target, target spacing, stimulus luminance, 
with presented direction as the between-subjects variable. Each participant was randomly 
assigned to each presented direction condition. The 15 stimuli (5 diameter of target × 3 
stimulus luminance × 3 spacing of inter-target) were presented to the participant. The 
presentation order of these stimuli was counterbalanced among participants. Some examples 
used in the present experiment were shown as Fig. 1.

In Table 1 are means and standard errors for all parameters. The main effect of subject 
group on aiming time was significant (F2,42 = 17.5,  p<.001, partial η2= 0.46). Multiple 
comparisons showed that the aiming time for low vision was significantly longer than that for 
myopia and sighted subject, but the difference between the latter two groups was not 
significant.

Analyses identified a main effect for diameter of target on aiming time (F4,168 = 20.2, 
p<.001, partial η2= 0.33). The results suggested that the aiming time for 0.3-cm, 0.4-cm, and 
0.6-cm was significantly longer than that for 0.5-cm and 0.7-cm. Moreover, the aiming time

time were not significant for myopia  (3.56 vs 3.23 vs 3.32; F2,30 = 2.10, p=.14, partial η2= 
0.12) and sighted subject (2.75 vs 2.75 vs 2.69; F2,30 = 0.60, p=.56, partial η2= 0.04).

The third significant interaction was between subject group and spacing between targets 
(F4,84 = 6.74, p<.001, partial η2= 0.24). Fig. 4 shows the mean aiming time versus subject

    Participants sat at a table of 75 cm in height and completed reaching movement test 
using their index finger of right hand. Reaching movements were performed form a start 
position, which was placed 10 cm from the edge of the table, to a target light. Three target 
lights were fixed on a stimulus plate which was put on the table. The vertical distance 
between start position and near target to participant was 30 cm and between start position and 
far target to participant was 40 cm, respectively. Two background lights were located on two 
sides (right and left) of the middle target simultaneously.  In a given background light color 
condition, the two background lights illuminated earlier than target did. The discrepancy of 
background and target lights was about 3 sec. A head and chin rest was used to control the 
constant viewing distance. Participants performed the test with binocular.  
 
Procedure 
   At the beginning of the experiment, participants were told the instructions to familiarize 
the experimental procedure. Before exposure the stimuli, participants received 3 practice trials. 
All participants were tested individually in a quiet experiment room in which the light level 
was approximately 300 lux.  
 
    Participants were asked to put their index finger on the start position after they sat on the 
table. To begin each trial, experimenter reported “Attention.” After 2 sec, participant was 
given a reminding signal to preparer for reaching movement. Then the background and target 
lights illuminated successively. Participants were instructed to move their index finger to the 
illuminated target and press it to extinguish the target as quickly and accuracy as possible 
once target illuminated (See Fig.5). The reaching movement activities were recorded by a 
digital camera which fixed over the table. Participant’s reaching time was analyzed by Adobe 
Preniere Pro 2.0 software. Participants had put their index finger on the start position again 
before to start next trial. Participants repeated the procedures until all 36 stimuli were 
completed. Each participant spent approximately 25 min. on the test.

Analyses identified a main effect for color of interfered light on reaching time (F3,135 = 
3.41, p=.02, partial η2= 0.07). The results suggested that the reaching time for red and yellow 
was significantly longer than that for green and blue one; however, the difference was 
significant neither between red and yellow light, nor between green and blue light. A main 
effect was also identified on reaching time for movement distance (F2,90 = 71.91, p<.001, 
partial η2= 0.62). Furthermore comparisons showed that 40-cm facilitated movement time, 
compared with 30- and 35-cm condition; moreover, the 35-cm condition yield reaching time 
greater than that for 30-cm condition. 
 
There was an effect of the type of reminding signal on the reaching time (F2,90 = 14.63, 
p<.001, partial η2= 0.25). The two reminding signal sound and touch yield reaching time 
shorter than that for no reminding signal. However, no difference between sound signal and 
touch signal was found.

Procedure 
   Participants sat at a table of 75 cm in height and completed pointing task using their index 
finger of right hand. Pointing tasks were executed form a start position, which was placed 15 
cm from the edge of the table, to a target light. At the beginning of the experiment, 
participants were told the instructions to familiarize the experimental procedure. Before 
exposure the stimuli, participants received 3 practice trials. All participants were tested 
individually in a quiet experiment room. 
 
    Participants were asked to put their index finger of right hand on the start position after 
they sat on the table. The index finger of participant’s pointing hand was stuck a red circular 
mark of 0.5 cm in diameter. To begin each trial, experimenter reported “Attention.” After 2 
sec, a target light illuminated. Participants were instructed to point the illuminated target with 
their index finger as quickly and accuracy as possible once the target illuminated. Participant 
was asked to report “OK” once he/she completed the pointing task. After 1 sec., participant 
returned their index finger and put on the starting position again to wait for performing next 
trial. The pointing activities were recorded by a digital camera which fixed over the targets. 
Participant’s pointing time and position (i.e., pointing angle) were analyzed by Adobe 
Preniere Pro 2.0 software and PicPick Image Editor software, respectively. Participants 
repeated the procedures until all 18 stimuli were completed. Each participant spent 
approximately 15 min. on the test. Participants were encouraged to rest if necessary. 
 
Data Analysis 
Pointing performance was analyzed in terms of error of pointing angle, measure in 
degree. The error of pointing angle was defined in terms of the angle constituted of 
intersection by two lines, i.e., target -center of participant’s eyes-pointing position in 
binocular condition; target-center of participant’s right eye-pointing position in the monocular 
condition. Data were obtained for 18 trials and entered into the analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
which was carried out using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). 
 
Results and Discussions 
 
In Table 4 are means and standard errors for all parameters. The main effect of subject 
group on error of pointing angle was significant (F2,39 = 17.33,  p<.001, partial η2= 0.47). 
Multiple comparisons showed that the error of pointing angle for low vision was significantly 
greater than that for myopia and sighted subject; however, the difference between the latter 
two groups was not found.

than that for monocular condition. However, the effect of the illumination on the error of 
pointing angle was not found (F2,39 = 1.37, p=.27, partial η2= 0.07).  
 
These results showed three two-way interactive effects. The first was a significant 
interaction between the illumination and source of cue (F2,39 = 3.37, p=.045, partial η2= 0.15) 
on error of pointing angle, as shown in Fig. 10. These data implied that the error of pointing 
angle of binocular was significantly greater than that for monocular, regardless of illumination. 
The simple effect on error of pointing angle of source of cue (monocular vs binocular) was 
significant for the illumination of 50 watt (1.91 vs 2.18; F1,15 = 11.09, p=.005, partial η2= 
0.43), 150 watt (1.65 vs 1.80; F1,15 = 6.66, p=.021, partial η2= 0.31), and 250 watt (1.57 vs 
1.99; F1,15 = 27.27, p<.001, partial η2= 0.65).

The second significant interaction was between target direction and subject group (F16,312 
= 1.73, p=.041, partial η2= 0.08). Fig. 11 shows the mean error of pointing angle versus 
subject group for the range of target direction. These data implied that the error of pointing 
angle of low vision was significantly greater than those for myopia and sighted subject, 
regardless of target direction; however, the difference between myopia and sighted subject 
seemed not be obvious.

Conclusions 
 
One hundred years ago Woodworth (1899) presented a model of goal-directed movement 
that attempted to explain the relation between movement speed and movement 
accuracy/consistency. Although his model had an open-loop or ballistic component, the main 
determinant of movement error was the time available to use kinesthetic and visual feedback 
to engage in closed-loop error reduction (Ricker, Elliot, Lyons, Gauldie, Chua, & Byblow, 
1999). The empirical studies have reatedly showed that the availability of visual feedback, 
and/or time to use it, is the major dterminant of movement accuracy/consistency in simple 
manual aiming tasks (Elliot & Allard, 1985; Smith & Bowden, 1980). Howerver, the 
participant in above mentioned empirical studies were normal person, not the visually 
impaired. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of other 
independent variables on single aiming performance for the visually impaired. 
 
In the foregoing experiments we observed that for goal-directed aiming or reaching the 
movement accuracy for low vision were greater than that for myopia and sighted subjects, 
indicating the abilities of gathering the visual information might be an important role in a 
goal-directed aiming movement. The results of the present experiments support and extend 
recent research on the effect of characteristics of target and visual feedback on aiming or 
reaching performance. These results can help the visually impaired to understand the nature of 
the disability by thoroughly studying the nature of the goal-directed aiming and have 
implications for the design of product for the visually impaired. 
 
Some future works are needed to study. First, should provide converging evidence for the 
role of attention in the control of single aiming movements. One prediction, from a 
limited-capacity model of attention, is that the slope of the relationship between target width 
and average velocity might be depend, up to a certain point, on the attention demands of the 
secondary task. Second, should provide a more thorough kinematic record of response 
trajectories and determine the extent to which subjects can control movement variablility prior 
to. Third, should design the user interface dependent upon users’ abilities to make it 
compatible with the task and the user, especially for the visually impaired.
