Abstract 
This research targets on developing the method of brain dynamics imaging to aggrandize 
the noninvasive detection techniques. We choose Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal as 
material because of higher temporal resolution and smaller attenuation comparing to functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), respectively.  
The MEG signal represents the summation of whole brain activities. Different 
combinations of signal sources may lead to the same MEG measurement, so the inverse 
estimation of MEG signal sources is an ill-posed problem. To localize sources, we use spatial 
filters constructed by maximum contrast beamformer (MCB) which is similar to other 
beamformer methods except the closed-form solution of optimum dipole orientations and the 
maximum contrast constraint. However, the result only represents the significant level of each 
position on brain jointing activities and can not reveal the true source activities in brain. 
We develop the method using a Bayesian framework. The distribution of weightings is 
constrained by a prior which uses the MCB result in our method, and the likelihood is defined 
by the forward model and the true measurement. Then we use maximum a posterior (MAP) to 
get optimum weightings which can be applied to estimate brain source activities. In the future, 
we would like to combine MEG and fMRI to reconstruct brain dynamics more accurately.

electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). They record signals 
through sensors outside the skull. fMRI detects brain activity with very high spatial solution 
which is up to 1 mm. What fMRI record is Blood Oxygen Level BOLD. BOLD is an 
accessory effect of neural activities changing with low speed, so the time resolution of fMRI 
just approaches to 1 second.  
 When human brain is working, the neurons on relative cortex exchange information 
through ion flows and chemical substances, which induce electric potential and magnetic field 
to change. MEG sensors and EEG electrodes measure the magnetic field outside the scalp and 
electrical potential on the scalp, respectively. We analyze those signals to get active area on 
cortex. Because EEG and MEG have high time resolution, they are suitable to research the 
dynamical brain activity and correlation between distinct areas. However, electrical potential 
is easy to disperse because of the brain tissue and the skull. Magnetism is one kind of field 
force, so the attenuation resulting from non-uniform of brain tissue, skull, and epidermis is 
smaller. Besides that, MEG is less affected by secondary currents induced by neural activities. 
Based on above reasons, it is more accurate to use MEG than use EEG to localize sources.  
 The measurement of MEG and EEG are sum of total activities in the brain. Because the 
number of sensors is much less than the number of sources, different combinations of sources 
may bring about the same measurement. Inverse estimation of sources is an ill-posed problem. 
To obtain a reasonable solution, there is an equivalent current dipole (ECD) model, which 
uses a dipole to represent total effects of activities in an area. And we often acquire a more 
meaningful solution through setting constrains, such like structure constraint and minimum 
norm constrain. 
 Technique of Estimating Brain Function 
There are many methods to solve this inverse problem now. The widely used technique is 
dipole fitting which supposes that the number of ECD is fixed then it estimates the parameters 
of sources to minimize the difference between estimation and measurement. But this 
optimization often falls to local minimum and always changes results when modifying initial 
parameters. MUSIC is a global optimization method, so it avoids above problems. It projects 
signal to signal subspace and the locations of peaks would be sources. However, the signal 
subspace can＇t be calculated accurately because of noise. This will affect the accuracy of 
source localization. MNE supposes that sources are dispersive currents. Goal of this method is 
also to minimize the distance between estimation and measurement. It sets minimum norm 
constrain to minimize the dispersal of current, but the resulting sources will tend to distribute 
near the cortical surface. 
 Beamformer Method 
 Beamformer is one kind of spatial filters. By linear combination of signal from sensors 
in different locations, we can get the signal beaming from a specific location in the brain. On

temporal smoothness, anatomy, and functional constraints, and propose to obtain a “maximum 
a posterior (MAP)” solution. At first, a popular solution called weighted minimum L2-norm 
method (WMN) introduces one constraint into a prior. But when we concern about more than 
one constraint, the introduction of multiple constraints and their appropriate weighting turns 
to difficult. A common solution is empirical Bayesian solution which constructs a hierarchical 
linear model where multiple constraints are specified in terms of variance components and 
then iteratively computes the hyperparameters and parameters using Expectation 
Maximization (EM) algorithm.  
Bayesian inference approach is also used. It does not result in a single best solution to 
the inverse problem but produce a large number of likely solutions that fit both the data and 
any prior information. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or other MCMC variants, such 
as reversible jump (RJ) MCMC and parallel tempering (RT) MCMC, are used to sample the 
many likely solutions. However, this approach using sampling method has two major 
problems: high complexity and slow convergence.  
The proposed Bayesian-based methods always use information from other modality, such 
as fMRI or PET, as a prior. The major problem of combining different modality is that 
different techniques detect different physiology indexes which are hardly to prove their 
coherences. We propose a method using MEG signal to construct prior information, i.e. 
F-statistic distribution, and avoid unsuspected errors which arise from multi-modality 
integration. 
IV. Methods

where ( ) ( )( )ttp mq |  is a posterior probability, and ( ) ( )( )ttp qm |  is likelihood which means 
that the probability of recording MEG signal m(t) under known brain activity strength q(t). 
When there are S sources in the brain, time sequence of source strength is a Ndx1 vector:

which is time sequence of estimated source strength considering whole sources in the brain.

 Simulations 
The performance of the proposed method is examined with simulation. MEG data are 
simulated over 306 sensors spread over the head by activating one focal source (Fig. 2a). The 
activation is modeled with 20 Hz sine wave over 400 msec. and random noise is added in both 
source space and sensor space (Fig. 2b, 2c, and 2d).

V. Results and Discussion 
We have implemented above method and a traditional method, called WMN, with the 
MCB result (Fig. 3) as a prior. The locations of sample points used to do reconstruction are 
shown in Fig.4. Fig. 5 and 6 show reconstruction activities of the simulated brain source after 
the trigger 90 ms. Fig. 5(a) and 6(a) are the power distribution maps reconstructed by WMN,

The goodness of fits of results constructed by the two methods is shown on Fig. 8(a) and

Bayesian-based algorithm doesn’t improve WMN. Because the hyperparameters aren’t

In this research project, we developed an integrative platform for imaging neuronal dynamics to 
understand mechanisms of cognitive brain functions and neural disease. The development included 
fusion of fMRI and MEG data and the algorithms for their signal processing. The developed 
algorithms have been described in our technical report, another electronic file. Originally, we 
planned to compare the results by using our developed algorithm with those by using the 
state-of-the-art algorithm (dSPM). However, in the end we did not apply our method to the above 
mentioned data sets. In what follows, functional MRI and MEG signals were processed and 
integrated by using the dSPM algorithm. 
 
The results revealed spatiotemporal dynamics of the information processing cascade to word 
reading. That is, information processing flow started from occipital cortex for encoding the visual 
inputs, and then proceeded to cortical areas for further processing steps, e.g. lexical identification, 
phonological retrieval , phonetic encoding, motor programming and execution.
