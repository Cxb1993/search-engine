 
Abstract─This project demonstrates single- 
band and dual-band low-IF image rejection 
receivers using Weaver and Hartley 
architectures. A dual-band reconfigure 
receiver is achieved by changing the polarity 
of the quadrature LO signals; thus, both the 
first- and second-stage mixers can be highly 
reused. On the other hand, at a higher 
operating frequency, the microwave 
quadrature signal generation methods are 
included to generate highly accurate 
high-frequency quadrature signals.  
 
Index Terms ─  Image rejection, low-IF, 
dual-band, Weaver, Hartley. 
 
I. Introduction 
Compared with the two (or multiple)- 
separate-system solutions for multi-band 
applications, the dual-band (or multi-band) 
reconfigurable system has a relatively high 
integration level. For dual-band transceivers, 
the direct-conversion architectures were 
demonstrated in the past. Besides, some 
dual-band dual-conversion systems were 
demonstrated while the signal was 
down-converted to the baseband (IF2=0) at the 
second stage; thus, there is no second image 
problem but the flicker noise and dc offset 
problems arise and need more efforts to solve. 
Most of these zero-IF multi-band receivers 
require more than one local oscillator. Since 
IF2=0, it is difficult to use one VCO covering 
both bands. The extra VCO may cause 
substrate cross-talk and spurious signals. 
 
II. Weaver-Hartley Image Rejection 
Architecture 
First, for a single-band application, the 
trigonometric analysis can be applied. Weaver 
architecture consists of two cascaded complex 
mixers. Received signals are twice 
down-converted to a low-IF band by the first 
LO and second LO signals. The angular 
frequencies of the desired, first image, and 
second image, first LO, and second LO 
signals are denoted as ωRF, ωIM1, ωIM2, ωLO1 
and ωLO2, respectively. The angular 
frequencies of the IF signal after the first and 
second down-conversions are defined as ωIF1 
and ωIF2, respectively. The relations of the 
signals defined above can be expressed as: 
 
1 1 1 1RF LO LO IM IFω ω ω ω ω− = − =      (1a) 
( ) ( )1 2 1 2 2 2RF LO LO LO LO IM IFω ω ω ω ω ω ω− + = + − = (1b) 
1 2 2IF LO IFω ω ω= +           (1c) 
 
The wire connection of the Weaver system 
with detailed mathematical analyses is shown 
in Fig. 1. The desired RF signal, first image 
signal, and second image signal are denoted as 
aRFcos(ωRFt), aIM1cos(ωIM1t), and 
aIM2cos(ωIM2t), respectively. Figure 1(a) 
indicates the results at each node of the 
Weaver system when the input signals are RF 
and first image signals. The first image signal 
and desired RF signal are converted to the 
same IF1 frequency (ωIF1) but with opposite 
signs of the quadrature signals after the first 
down-conversion. The high-frequency term 
(2ωLO1+ωIF1) can be eliminated by the 
low-pass or band-pass nature of the first-stage 
mixer. The other two signals entering the 
second-stage mixers are down-converted to 
ωIF2 and (2ωIF1-ωIF2) bands respectively. 
Therefore, the shifted-out image signal can be 
easily filtered-out by the low-pass filter at IF2 
stage.  
On the other hand, the RF and second 
image signals are down-converted to ωIF1 and 
(ωIF1-2ωIF2), respectively, after the first 
down-conversion, as shown in Fig. 1(b). 
Although the two signals do not locate at the 
same frequency, they are still very close and 
hard to be separated by a narrow-band filter. 
After the second conversion, the two signals 
locate at the same frequency (ωIF2) but with 
opposite signs of quadrature signals. That is, 
the Weaver system can reject the first image 
signal but it has no ability to reject the second 
image signal. To solve this problem, a 
polyphase filter is employed after the Weaver 
system. Because the polyphase filters can 
reject the negative-frequency signal but pass 
the positive-frequency signal. As a result, the 
image signals located at the negative spectrum 
can be highly rejected. The second-stage 
complex mixers with the subsequent 
polyphase filter can be called the Harley 
system. 
Instead of the conventional trigonometric 
analysis, the complex-signal diagrammatic 
explanation shown in Fig. 2 gives a more 
direct insight to the RF system architecture. 
 
1) Rejection of the First Image Signal 
The RF signal and quadrature LO signals 
can be denoted as RFcos tω  and LOj te− ω , 
respectively. On the other hand, the first 
positive ωIF2 complex frequency as shown in 
Fig. 2(c). On the other hand, the first image 
signal, 　IM1, is down-converted to the 
negative (2ωIF1-ωIF2) complex frequency. 
Because of the dual conversion phenomena, 
the first image signal can be easily filtered out 
by the low-pass filter as shown in Fig. 2(c). 
Normally, the frequency response of the IF 
circuits can serve as the low-pass filter as long 
as the ωIF1 is large enough. 
 
2) Rejection of the Secondary Image   
Signal 
The dual-conversion down-converter still 
suffers from the secondary image signal 
problem, and the frequency of the secondary 
image signal is 2ωIF2 away from the RF 
frequency as shown in Fig. 2(c). The 
secondary image signal is also shifted 
downward twice by the two complex mixers 
of the Weaver system.  However, the 
down-converted secondary image signal is not 
shifted outside the frequency response of the 
low-pass filter as with the first image signal, 
IM1. Instead, the frequency of the 
down-converted secondary image signal is 
shifted to the negative ωIF2 spectrum, while 
the down-converted RF signal is located at 
ωIF2, as shown in Fig. 2(c). This 
down-converted secondary image signal 
cannot be filtered out by the low-pass filter 
and disturbs the down-converted desired RF 
signal. On the other hand, the polyphase filter, 
which is an asymmetrical complex notch filter, 
can filter out the down-converted secondary 
image signal by eliminating the signals in the 
negative spectrum, as illustrated in Fig. 2(d).  
 
3) Band Selection 
The band selection at the 5.7-GHz band is 
depicted in Fig. 3(a). The solid-line, dotted 
line, and the dashed-line arrows represent the 
RF signal, the IM1 signal, and the IM2 signal, 
respectively. The RF signal, as well as the 
undesired IM1 and IM2 signals, are located at 
the positive spectrum, and down-converted by 
the LO1j te− ω  and LO 2j te− ω  LO signals, 
respectively. As discussed above, the 
Weaver-Hartley architecture can reject both 
the first and secondary image signals. On the 
other hand, when the desired signals are 
around 2.4-GHz, the signals located at the 
negative spectrum are down-converted by the 
LO1j te ω  and LO 2j te− ω  LO signals, as shown in Fig. 
3(b).

the signals filtered by the final IF polyphase filters.  
cycle signals preceding a polyphase filter 
(quadrature generator) generate high-order 
harmonics and lead to large phase error, 
especially when the following circuit is a 
hard-switched Gilbert mixer (second-stage 
mixer). Therefore, the 50% duty cycle is 
critical for the Weaver-Hartley image rejection 
system. The divide-by-five circuit consists of 
five current switchable source-coupled logic 
D flip-flops and employs the SHSHH 
(sample-hold-sample- hold-hold) scheme to 
achieve the 50% duty cycle. The schematic of 
the current switchable source coupled logic D 
flip-flop is shown in Fig. 6. Two extra 
differential pairs with control inputs θ and θ  
are inserted between the sample-and-hold 
stage and the clock stage of the traditional D 
flip-flop to commutate the clock current signal 
and switch the triggering edge of the clock for 
sample-and-hold. The input data is sampled 
when clock and θ  are the same; on the other 
hand, the data is held when they are opposite. 
Therefore, this current switchable D flip-flop 
can be triggered at both the positive edge and 
the negative edge. 
  A conventional Gilbert multiplier has a 
time-delay between the signal through the 
bottom differential pair and the signal through 
the top differential pair and thus gives rise to 
asymmetrical output waveforms. To remedy 
this problem, a fully symmetrical multiplier 
circuit with equal delay paths between two 
input signals is adopted in this work. Figure 7 
shows a truly balanced frequency doubling 
multiplier, consisting of two conventional 
Gilbert multipliers. The in-phase and 
quadrature-phase input signals connect to the 
top and bottom stages of one multiplier, 
respectively. On the other hand, the input 
signals of the other multiplier are connected in 
the opposite way. Therefore, one multiplying 
path contains a phase lead and the other path 
contains a phase lag. By summing the outputs 
of the two constituent multipliers, the phase 
delay is cancelled in the combined signals. 
The two-section polyphase filter in Fig. 7 
generates quadrature signals needed by the 
truly balanced frequency doubler. 
 
2) LO Switching Circuit 
The 2.4/5.7-GHz band selections are 
achieved by changing the polarity of the LO1 
signals. Figure 9 shows the band-selection 
switching circuits. When S1 is low and S2 is 
high, the 5.7-GHz band is selected. The LO1 
signals are in the clockwise sequence of I+, Q-, 
I-, and Q+, and can be represented by LO1j te− ω . 
On the other hand, the 2.4-GHz band is 
chosen when S1 is high and S2 is low. The

generator.

desired signal is 8 dB when the RF signal 
frequency is around 5.7 GHz. On the other 
hand, the first image signal near 2.4-GHz has 
a conversion loss of 32 dB, and the conversion 
loss of the secondary image signal      
(5.64-GHz) is 38 dB. Similarly, the gain is 9 
dB when the desired RF signal frequency is 
around 2.4-GHz, as shown in Fig. 14(b). The 
first image signal (near 5.7 GHz) and the 
secondary image signal (near 2.46-GHz) have 
a conversion loss of 31 and 35 dB, 
respectively.  
In other words, when the RF frequency is 
5.7-GHz  (2.4-GHz), the image rejection 
ratios of the first and secondary image signals 
are about 40 dB (40 dB) and 46 dB (44 dB), 
respectively. The frequency response of the 
secondary image signal is a band-stop shape 
because of the complex filtering behavior of 
the polyphase filter. The IF bandwidth of the 
measured image rejection ratio of the 
secondary image signal starts from 12-MHz to 
48-MHz. On the other hand, the image 
rejection ratio of the first image signal has a 
flat frequency response because the image 
rejection mechanism of the Weaver system 
comes from dual LO frequency shifting, as 
discussed in Fig. 2. 
Figure 13 shows the waveforms of I/Q 
output ports. The measured result indicates 
that the output signals are quite balanced. The 
in-phase and quadrature-phase waveforms 
also demonstrate that the circuit is highly 
balanced, including the signal phase and the 
signal magnitude. 
The measured RF-to-IF, LO-to-RF and 
LO-to-IF isolations are better than 60 dB, 64 
dB and 62 dB, respectively.  
 
(B) 
The block diagram of the 2.4/5.7-GHz 
dual-band dual-conversion downconverter 
using another LO generator is shown in Fig. 
14. The frequency multiplier with the multiple 
of 2.5 consists of a frequency doubler (×2) 
and a frequency divider (÷2). After the mixing 
operation of a single-sideband (SSB) 
up-converter, the LO1 (2.5×LO2) signal is thus 
generated. Both differential-quadrature signals 
of the LO1 and LO2 are generated by a 
two-section poly-phase filter with the center 
frequency of 4.05 and 1.62 GHz, respectively. 
Figure 15(a) shows the block diagram of the 
static divider consisting of two D-latches 
realized by emitter-coupled logic. The 
schematic of the D-latch, consisting of the 
sample and hold stages, is shown in Fig. 15(b). 
Instead of using a simple cross-coupled pair, 
the common-collector configuration is 
inserted into the positive feedback loop at the 
hold stage to achieve a wider output swing. 
Figure 16(a) shows the function block of 
the multiplier while the schematic of the 
multiplier is shown in Fig. 16(b). If f1≠f 2, the 
multiplier is an SSB up-converter while the 
(f1-f2) frequency component is cancelled if the 
two input signals have the perfect quadrature

RF performance. Figure 18 shows the CG and 
the SSB-NF of 2.4/5.7-GHz bands with a 
supply voltage of 3 V. The CG is 5/4 dB while 
the NF is about 20 dB for 2.4/5.7-GHz band 
while the IF frequency is below 100 MHz and 
the LO power is only 2 dBm. Besides, the 
IRRs of both the first and second image 
signals for 2.4-GHz band are shown in Fig. 19. 
The IRR1 is above 40 dB and is flat due to the 
one-way frequency shifting. Compared with 
the IRR1, the IRR2 is 44-dB within a narrow 
band from 15 to 45 MHz due to the frequency 
response of the four-section poly-phase filter 
following the second-stage mixers. On the 
other hand, the IRR1 and IRR2 are 39 and 46 
dB within the IF bands from 15 to 45 MHz for 
the 5.7-GHz mode as shown in Fig 20.  
Figure 21 shows the power performance of 
both 2.4/5.7-GHz bands. The IP1dB is -12/-9 
dBm while the IIP3 is 2/6 dBm for 
2.4/5.7-GHz band when IF=30 MHz. The 
output waveform of both I/Q channels are 
shown in Fig. 22 and the figure shows the 
0.46 dB magnitude mismatch and the 0.62° 
phase error.

(D) 
The passive mixer has a low flicker noise 
corner since the transistors operate at the 
off-overlap region, but the severe loss forfeits 
the capability of suppressing the subsequent 
noise contributions. Thus, a preceding 
low-noise amplifier with a much higher gain 
is necessary. On the other hand, the 
conversion gain of the active Gilbert mixer 
performs a good suppression of the noise 
contributions of the following stage. The 
dynamic-injection method can reduce the 
flicker noise contribution to the output 
through the direct mechanism if the RF 
frequency is not high. However, as the 
operating frequency becomes higher, the 
flicker noise issue becomes much serious 
since the indirect mechanism, resulting from 
the parasitic capacitances, dominates. 
Moreover, the inductor is placed at the source 
nodes of the Gilbert core to resonate the 
parasitic capacitances; however, the 
performance is still limited. 
Therefore, the low-IF architecture is 
preferred for a 10-GHz receiver because the 
several tens MHz IF band is far away from the 
flicker noise corner. Besides, the dc offset 
problem can be lessened by placing a large 
dc-blocking capacitor at the output. 
  On the other hand, the extra dc power 
consumption is needed to realize a frequency 
divider or a quadrature voltage-controlled 
oscillator (QVCO) for the LO quadrature 
signal generation. A poly-phase filter can 
generate accurate I/Q signals within a narrow 
bandwidth; however, the parasitic 
capacitances and the process variations lead to 
the shifting of the center frequency and the

compact since the center frequency of the 
coupler is several times the operating 
frequency, e.g., f0=1.85fbal1 if k=0.8; however, 
the multiple will be even larger when 
considering the loss effects. 
Since the RF coupler needs 50-Ω loads to 
maintain the quadrature outputs and thus the 
common-gate configuration is chosen to 
achieve a wideband 50-Ω matching for the 
10-GHz operation. 
The die photo of the 10-GHz Weaver- 
Hartley dual-conversion down-converter is 
shown in Fig. 32 and the die size is 1.92x1.7 
mm2. On-wafer measurement is employed for 
the RF performance. The supply voltage is 
1.8 V with the power consumption of 80 mW. 
In Fig. 32, the spiral-typed broadside coupler 
is realized using metal 6 and metal 5. The line 
width, line spacing and the outer diameter of 
the 10-GHz coupler are 10, 3 and 120 µm, 
respectively. On the other hand, the 4-GHz 
coupler has 10-µm line width, 3-µm line 
spacing and 200-µm outer diameter. From 
simulation, the center frequency of each 
10-GHz/4-GHz broadside- coupled coupler is 
25 and 13 GHz, respectively.  
Figure 33 shows the conversion gain with 
respect to the LO1 and LO2 power; thus, LO1 
power is chosen to be 10 dBm while the LO2 
power is 8 dBm for the fully current 
commutation of both the first- and second- 
stage active mixers.  
The image-rejection performances are shown 
in Fig. 34. The image-rejection ratio (IRR) of 
the first image signal (from 6.67 to 6.72 GHz) 
is 33 dB covering the IF2 frequency from 10 
to 60 MHz. On the other hand, the IRR of the 
second image signal (from 9.91 to 9.96 GHz) 
is over 40 dB. The output I/Q waveforms are 
shown in Fig. 35 when fRF, fLO1, fLO2, and fIF 
are 10, 4.175, 1.62 and 0.03 GHz, respectively.
