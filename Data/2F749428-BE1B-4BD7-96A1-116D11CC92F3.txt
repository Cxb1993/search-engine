2silver (melting point 961°C), in the fabrication of multilayer microwave devices,
low-firing-temperature microwave dielectric materials with high dielectric constant ( r), high
quality factor (Q) and small temperature coefficients of the resonant frequency ( f ) are needed [1].
Especially when they are used in UHF and SHF band, they should have a high r, since then the
guided-wavelength in the medium is rather long as compared to other higher frequency bands. In
the past years, many microwave dielectrics, such as (Pb,Ba)O-Nd2O3-TiO2 [2] and
(Ba,Sr)O-Sm2O3-TiO2 [3] were developed and widely used.
Generally, microwave dielectrics with high dielectric constant usually required high sintering
temperatures. For example, the sintering temperatures of CaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-TiO2 [4],
CaO-BaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-TiO2 [5, 6], CaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-Nd2O3-TiO2 [7] and
CaO-BaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-Nd2O3-TiO2 [8] ceramics system were reported to be around
1300°C–1400°C. Three methods are commonly used for reducing the sintering temperature of
dielectric ceramics: low-melting-point glass addition [9-12], chemical processing [13] and the use
of starting materials with smaller particle sizes [14]. The first method with liquid-phase sintering
was found to effectively lower the firing temperature. However, it also decreased the microwave
dielectric properties of dielectric resonators. The chemical process often required a flexible
procedure that was not only expensive but also time consuming. The CaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-TiO2
compound was first investigated by Ezaki et al [15]. At a sintering temperature of 1350°C, it
exhibited excellent microwave dielectric properties ( r~ 105, Q×f ~ 4640 GHz and f ~ 13
ppm/°C). With the addition of BaCu(B2O5), the sintering temperature of CaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-TiO2
ceramics could be lowered to 1050°C [16]. BaCu(B2O5)-doped CaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-TiO2 appeared to
be a potential candidate for low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC). Since B2O3 and CuO are
also well-known sintering aids, it attracted our attention and provided the motivation to study the
influence of CuO on the sintering behavior and the microwave dielectric properties of B2O3-doped
CBLSNT ceramics. In addition to B2O3, CuO was doped as a sintering aid to further lower the
4Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of CBLSNT ceramics with 4 wt% B2O3 addition
sintered at different temperatures (850–950C) for 4 h. It is found that the CBLSNT ceramic
contains two mixed phases. One phase consistent with the previous report [15] has been identified
as CaO-Li2O-(Sm,Nd)2O3-TiO2, while the other peak was identified as that of
BaO-(Sm,Nd)2O3-4TiO2 with JCPDS #43-0235 [19]. As compared to CaO-Li2O-(Sm,Nd)2O3-TiO2,
it is obvious that the secondary phase of BaO-(Sm,Nd)2O3-4TiO2 formed in the BaO modified
ceramics. As shown in Fig. 1, CBLSNT was present as the crystalline phase and no significant
difference was observed at different sintering temperatures. Furthermore, figure 2 shows the X-ray
diffraction patterns of CBLSNT ceramics with 1 wt% CuO addition sintered at different
temperatures (850–950C) for 4 h.
The crystalline phases of CBLSNT ceramics with 4 wt% B2O3 and 1 wt% CuO additions
sintered at different temperatures (850–950C) for 4 h are identified and illustrated in Fig. 3. The
diffraction patterns of the ceramics exhibited identical peaks as shown in Fig. 1.
The SEM micrographs of CBLSNT ceramics with 4 wt% B2O3 addition sintered at different
temperatures (850–950C) for 4 h are illustrated in Fig. 4. The CBLSNT ceramics was not dense
and the grain did not grow at 850C. As the sintering temperature increased, the grain size increased.
At the same time, the SEM micrographs of CBLSNT ceramics with 1 wt% CuO addition sintered at
different temperatures (850–950C) for 4 h are illustrated in Fig. 5. To investigate the morphologies
of the samples, the surfaces of the sintered specimens were examined.
The SEM micrographs of CBLSNT ceramics with 4 wt% B2O3 and 1 wt% CuO additions
sintered at different temperatures (850–950C) for 4 h are shown in Fig. 6. The sintered surfaces
were porous and the grains had not grown well at 850C. With increasing in sintering temperature,
the porosity decreased and the grain growth apparently increased. These results again suggested that,
in addition to B2O3, CuO addition could effectively further lower the sintering temperature of
CBLSNT ceramics. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used in combination with
6Figure 9 shows the Q×f values of CBLSNT ceramics with various additions as a function of its
sintering temperature. For all cases, the Q×f value increased with increasing sintering temperature,
which is a similar trend to that observed for apparent density. The Q×f values of the CBLSNT
ceramics increased from 370–1100 to 1250–3000 (GHz) as the sintering temperature increased
from 850C to 950C, depending on the type and the amount of additions. However, degradation of
the Q×f value was observed at higher doping levels since the addition of liquid phase flux at a
lower sintering temperature would normally cause an increase in dielectric loss. The microwave
dielectric loss is mainly caused not only by the lattice vibrational modes, but also by the pores, the
second phases, the impurities, or the lattice defect [20-22]. Apparent density also plays an important
role in controlling the dielectric loss, and has been shown for other microwave dielectric materials.
Since the variation of Q×f was also consistent with that of density, it suggested the dielectric loss of
CBLSNT ceramics was mainly controlled by apparent density.
Figure 10 shows the f values of CBLSNT ceramics with various additions as a function of
its sintering temperature. The temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ) is related to the
composition, the additives and the second phase of the material. For the 4 wt% B2O3 and 1 wt%
CuO-doped CBLSNT ceramics, the f value varied from 100 to 48 ppm/C as the sintering
temperature increased from 850C to 950C.
4. Conclusion
In this study, B2O3 and CuO additives are used as sintering aids to effectively lower (400°C)
the sintering temperature of CBLSNT ceramics. The CBLSNT ceramics with small amounts of
B2O3 and CuO additions could be well sintered at 950C. In particular, the 4 wt% B2O3 and 1 wt%
CuO-doped CBLSNT ceramics sintered at 950C for 4 h have optimum dielectric properties of r~
71.2, Q×f ~ 3000 GHz and f ~ 48 ppm/C. Obviously, B2O3 and CuO could be a suitable
sintering aids that improves densification of the CBLSNT ceramics at very low temperature, and 4
