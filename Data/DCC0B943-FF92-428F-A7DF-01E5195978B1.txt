Abstract 
    To address the problems of energy depletion and environmental pollution, every country 
is actively seeking for alternative energy sources such as hydrogen energy, biomass energy and 
solar energy. Bioethanol and biodiesel are generally produced by fermentation and are 
currently the most popular alternative energy resources. Hydrogen is one of the clean energy 
carriers and to be well used in the future with advantages of non pollution and high-profile 
heat-value. There are many fermentation residues from bioethanol and biodiesel production. 
These residues could be used for further bioenergy production. Another fermentation residue is 
condensed molasses fermentation soluble (CMS), which is a by-product from the microbial 
fermentation of molasses. CMS is a carbohydrate-rich wastewater which is easily to be 
coverted into hydrogen and methane. The cellulose-rich fernmentation residues from winery 
and oil-producing factories are not completely utilized. Using these fermentation residues to 
produce hydrogen, methane and ethanol is an attractive commercial energy generation process. 
This is a three year project. A two-stage hydrogen and methane production system using 
CMS was established in the first year. The results show that the total energy production was 
200 kJ/d. Anaerobic bacteria could convert the soluble metabolic products in the effluent from 
hydrogen fermentation process. This system had total chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
removal of 65%. In the second year, Taguchi experimental design method was used to 
optimize the seed inoculums source, substrate concentration, cultivation temperature, pH and 
seed pretreatment method for fermenting α-cellulose. The optimal conditions for hydrogen 
production were CH sewage sludge seed, α-cellulose 20 g/L, 40oC, pH 6.0 and heat 
pretreatment. The significant effect factors were pH > cellulose concentration > seed 
pretreatment method = temperature > seed inoculums. The bioenergy production potential for 
solid fermentation residues (vinasse and soybean oil-extracted cake) was studied in the third 
year. The conditions of maximum bioenergy production potential from vinasse were cow dung 
seed, cultivation temperature 50oC, pH 6.0 and heat-pretreatment. Moreover, the paek 
hydrogen production yield was 5.4 mL/g-substrate using base pretreatment (pH 9.0); this is 
230% higher than that of non-pretreatment. 
 
第一章 前言 
石油、天然氣、煤等隨著人類文明的發展，大量開採導致使用年限分別僅剩數十年或
一、二百年，但是消耗量仍然與日俱增；又因為大量使用化石能源，造成地球之溫室效應，
使地球氣候異常。基於上述兩種原因，當前重要且迫切之課題便是尋找生生不息且潔淨之
再生能源。為提高國內能源供應的自主性，唯有開發國內再生能源，才能減少能源進口量(台
灣能源仰賴進口佔 98%)，以確保國家之永續發展。行政院於「挑戰 2008：國家發展重點計
畫」中納入推動再生能源。根據「再生能源發展條例草案」之定義，再生能源包含氫氣、
甲烷氣、生質酒精與生質柴油，都是生質能，皆為農林植物、沼氣、一般廢棄物與一般事
業廢棄物等直接利用或經處理所產生之能源。生質能源可藉著厭氧生物醱酵能源作物、能
源作物廢棄物、農業廢棄物、食品廢棄物或都市有機廢棄物而得到氫氣、甲烷、甲醇、乙
醇與揮發酸等液態醱酵物質，且是具有相當經濟價值之生質能產物。 
醱酵工業是我國的重要產業之一，包含味精製造、釀酒等，均會產生仍是高濃度有機
物的固體或液體殘餘物；其中「糖蜜濃縮液」及「酒糟」是醱酵產物，富含醣類或纖維素。
申請人曾在 2005 年指導碩士生以批次試驗方式，發現糖蜜濃縮液極為適合用以產氫與產甲
烷，產能效率各有特點(吳等人，2005)。因此擬以兩醱酵槽串連方式進行連續流試驗，藉以
充分掌握糖蜜濃縮液能源化的機制與操作策略，也可掌握氫化及甲烷化系統組合的關鍵因
子。 
根據環保署管制中心 97 年分析，廢酒糟、酒粕、酒精膠量約 104715 噸/年，未來加上
生質酒精廠廢棄物數量更為可觀。此外，2006 年秋作在雲林、嘉義及台南地區推廣種植大
豆及向日葵兩種能源作物，分別種植 715 公頃及 206 公頃，之後將視執行成效逐步推展到
全國各地休耕農田約 22 萬公頃。但是油源作物(oil-producing crops)利用於生質柴油之生
產，必須先將油源作物收割取其相關部位榨油，例如黃豆油的生產，根據文獻榨油後黃豆
粕佔原來重量 80%估計，共約生產黃豆粕年約數十萬公噸，目前作為肥料或飼料。榨油後
之殘渣富含纖維素、半纖維素與木質素，及其他可供生物分解之糖類、脂肪與蛋白質等，
只作為肥料或飼料之利用殊為可惜。生產生質柴油與生質酒精所種植之大量能源作物，僅
使用作物本身，從收割至進廠篩選殘留許多未利用的根、莖、葉等部位，富含澱粉、纖維
素、半纖維素、木質素、醣類、脂肪與蛋白質等，經過適當的菌種篩選、前處理或是與醱
酵殘餘物共同消化，可產生能源物質(詹等人，2006；藍等人，2005；徐，2005；林與夏，
2006；Najafpour et al.,2006；Osullivan et al.,2005)。 
 
第三章 文獻探討 
3.1 醱酵殘餘物厭氧產氫  
  台灣目前以農委會為主軸的國家型生質能源計畫，是以產生質酒精及生質柴油為主。
前者是以玉米、蔗糖、芒草(狼尾草)等高糖分子及高碳水化合物為料源，後者則以油菜籽、
葵花籽、大豆、棕梠、痲瘋樹等高油份物質為料源。上述能源作物於產酒精及產油後的殘
餘物，目前尚未被利用也未被研究後續之使用價值；但其仍含有醣類、纖維素、半纖維素
等生物可再利用之物質，若能將其藉醱酵以再能源化程序提升其作為能源的附加價值，將
對國家生質能源之政策推動，及環境保護與資源的有效利用有相當大之助益。本計畫之目
的是配合國家型生質能源計畫之推動，將能源生產後的殘餘纖維素(蔗渣、稻桿產酒精後的
殘餘物、藻類產油後的殘餘物等)作為再次能源化之料源，以擴大生質能之料源。 
產能殘餘纖維素料源物含大量的纖維素(cellulose)、半纖維素(hemicellulose)及木質素
(lignocellulose)…等成分，相當難以被生物分解，因此適當的前處理。纖維素水解技術主要
包括物理方法、化學方法(如酸水解)與生物法(如纖維素酵素水解)等方法，並通常需經過前
處理(如蒸汽爆破)以提升效率。但物理及化學方法有能量消耗多及會產生抑制後續生物程序
的物質的缺點，故生物法漸受重視。生物水解法(Biological hydrolysis)可分細菌水解法
(Bacterial hydrolysis)及酵素水解法(Enzymatic hydrolysis)。在此方面之國內外研究現況，綜
合整理說明如下。Kim 等人 (2006)以厭氧菌 Clostridium butyricum NCIB 9576 分解
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 及 Chlorella，產氫率分別為 0.83 and 0.93 mL H2/mL broth。
Antonopoulou 等人(2008)以甜高樑在 35oC 及水力停留時間(HRT) 6 小時醱酵，得最大產氫
率 2550 mL H2/d。國內成功大學利用 110 L 厭氧流體化床(55oC、pH 6、HRT 7.3 day 及總迴
流量 35 L/min)以廚餘過篩液為主要基質和狼尾草為輔助基質，在 193 天連續氫醱酵操作，
有機荷負 17.7 g-COD/L/day 有最高產氫速率約 1.64 L-H2/L/day，但是氫氣產率僅 3.74 
mmol-H2/g-CODin (鄭等人，2009)。本研究室以都市污泥分解榨油後之殘留物，批次試驗結
果顯示在 pH 8 及溫度 55oC 及不添加營養鹽的條件有最大產氫率 2.11 mL/g-residue (Lay et 
al., 2009)。 
3.2 環境因子及操作系統  
3.2.1 基質前處理對醱酵產氫之影響  
有機物之厭氧分解可分為四個步驟：水解、酸化、乙酸化與甲烷化。大顆粒或固態
複雜有機物之生物水解效率較差，常被稱為厭氧分解之速率限制步驟(rate-limiting step; 
Tiehm et al., 2001; Wang et al., 1999；Li and Noike, 1992)。目前常用的前處理方法包括熱前
處理、酸或鹼前處理、超音波前處理、熱化學前處理…..等。Stucky and McCarty (1978)研
究化學法處理，提出脂質易於酸性或鹼性條件下水解成脂肪酸；蛋白質於酸性條件下可水
3.2.2 菌種前處理對醱酵產氫之影響  
菌種前處理可去除污泥中對於不利產氫菌生存或氫氣生成的細菌等，以提高基質利用
率和產氫效率。產氫菌中有部份是兼氣菌，有些則為產胞子菌，針對產氫菌的特性可應用
不同的前處理方法將產氫菌從污泥中篩選出來。Ueno et al. (1995)利用曝氣法將污泥進行強
烈曝氣，可篩出兼氣菌 Bacillus sp.和產胞子菌 Clostridium butyricum。林等(1999)以加熱方
法處理污泥，可分離產胞子菌 Clostridium 和 Sporosarcina。酸、鹼前處理法可將污泥環境
之 pH 改變為不適合菌種生長的情況，讓 Clostridium 形成內胞子而進入休眠狀態，其他無
法形成胞子的細菌(如甲烷菌)則受到抑制或破壞，再將污泥置於 Clostridium 生長的環境使
其萌發。曝氣法需要較長的時間才可完成篩選；加熱法則會消耗能源，且處理大量的污泥
時操作較不方便，而酸、鹼前處理法較節省時間和能源。 
Cai 等人(2004)將初沉池之活性污泥以 4 M NaOH 緩慢添加至 pH 12，並持續攪拌 30 分
鐘後靜置於室溫 25 oC 下 24 小時。再將鹼前處理後之污泥，以初始 pH 4~12 進行批次培養，
結果顯示初始 pH 11 可得產氫率為 16.6 ml H2/g DS，與原始污泥之 9.1 ml H2/g DS 相較有明
顯提升。Zhu and Beland (2006)將消化污泥以不同前處理方式(加熱、曝氣、酸、鹼、甲烷菌
抑制劑和碘丙烷抑制劑)，比較製備產氫菌種的適合性，曝氣方法無法完全抑制甲烷菌活
性，但有最高的產氫率 6.12 mol H2/mol sucrose added。Xiao and Liu(2006)利用四種前處理
(酸、鹼、熱及超音波)廢棄活性污泥，實驗顯示四種前處理方法皆可達到篩選產氫菌種並經
厭氧醱酵產生氫氣，其中以 pH 11.5 之鹼前處理可獲得最大產氫量 11.68 ml H2/g VS，其次
為熱前處理 8.62 ml H2/g VS。Jan 等人(2007)利用梭狀芽孢桿菌(Clostridium bifermentants)對
活性污泥進行厭氧消化作用，探討污泥經酸、鹼、滅菌、凍融等四種前處理以探討產氫能
力，結果顯示凍融前處理的污泥有最高的產氫量 0.68 g-H2/Kg DS。Ren 等人(2008)將菌種污
泥於培養前經過四種前處理(熱、酸、鹼和重複曝氣)，由重複曝氣的前處理方法可獲得最高
的產氫率 1.96 mol H2/mol-glucose。不同的前處理方式會造成醱酵類型的改變，加熱和鹼前
處理會造成丁酸型醱酵，酸前處理會獲得混合酸型醱酵，重複曝氣方法會造成乙醇型醱酵。
菌種前處理方法導致不同的初始菌群，直接反應在不同的氫氣產率和醱酵類型。 
3.2.3 pH 對醱酵產氫之影響  
  pH值對於微生物的生長具有很大的影響，各菌種皆有其特定之pH生長範圍，以及其最
適之pH生長範圍。不論微生物棲息地的pH值變化有多大，大部分微生物體內pH值仍接近於
中性。於非中性環境下，微生物之所以能維持其體內於中性，可歸因於其原形質膜(Plasma 
membrane)能不為質子所浸透(Impermeability to protons)。或許微生物是經由將質子以及氫氧
離子(OH-)抽出體外的方式，來維持細胞體內之正常pH值。雖然微生物通常能夠生長在pH 
4-9，但有些情況下其耐性還是會受影響。如將微生物生長環境之pH值予以猛烈變化，則微
生物的原形質膜會因受到破壞，其酵素及位於膜上面之傳送蛋白質(Membrane transport 
proteins)的活性將會因而受阻害，故微生物生長將會受傷害。由於改變外界pH值時，營養
且較節省能源(李，2003)。以經濟考量，中溫操作比較適當。 
中溫厭氧發酵產氫常採用 30~35 oC (Chang and Lin，2004；Chang et al.，2002； Yu et 
al.，2002)，但也有高溫產氫之報告(Hawkes et al.，2002)。Ueno et al. (2001)以牛肉汁和
peptone 及纖維粉末混合在 60 oC 發酵產氫；Zotemeyer et al. (1982)曾以 52 oC 研究葡萄糖之
厭氧酸化；Yu et al. (2002)以酒廠廢水在 20~55 oC 產氫，以 55 oC 有較高之效率。 
3.2.5 連續流操作系統  
文獻之暗醱酵反應器，有連續式完全攪拌混合(Continuously stirred tank reactor，
CSTR) 、上流式厭氧污泥氈 (Upflow anaerobic sludge blank ， UASB) 、膜反應器
(Membranebioreactor，MBR)、三相流化床(Fluidized bed reactor，FBR)、誘發式顆粒污泥
床法(Carrier-induced granular sludge bioreactor，CIGSB)及上升管式流體化床(Draft tube 
fluidized bed reactor，DTFBR) (吳等，2004)等種類。UASB 形成顆粒物泥需數個月之久，
雖可添加 Ca2+或 Al3+ 離子縮短顆粒形成時間，但仍需 1 個月(Yu et al., 2001；張，2004)。
MBR 可將微生物截留於反應槽中使微生物不易流失，但薄膜易阻塞且可能滋生甲烷菌，
需添加甲烷抑制劑或定期排泥(張，2001)。FBR 雖有極佳的熱傳與質傳效率，但反應器設
計、操作和控制很複雜。CIGSB 系統於 1-2 天內即可形成顆粒污泥(李，2004)且菌體濃度
高，因此能在極低 HRT( 1 h≦ ) 操作，最高產氫速率達 7.4 L H2/L-h，氫氣產率達 3.0 mol 
H2/mol sucrose；產氫優於 CSTR、FBR、MBR、Packed bed 及 UASB 系統(李，2004；吳
等，2004)。但林(2005)曾用上流式厭氧槽測試濃縮糖蜜醱酵液產氫，發現若未將基質作前
處理，優勢菌種與產氫量會隨著 HRT 與操作時間的增加而減少，甚至停止產氫。雖然固
定化細胞應用 DTFBR 有產氫效果，但因液體迴流速度快而不形成顆粒污泥，於低 HRT
之產氫效果不佳。

5.1.2 糖蜜醱酵殘餘物之降解情形  
氫醱酵槽的 COD 降解率很低，原因可能是殘餘物的分解量與代謝物的產生量互相抵
消，使 COD 降解量不明顯。但是醣類的降解率達 65%，顯示糖蜜醱酵殘餘物的醣類物質
很容易被分解(表 13)。第二階段之兩相串連操作時，甲烷醱酵槽之 COD 降解率比氫醱酵
槽高出很多，平均為 60%。此結果顯示，因醣類都在產氫醱酵槽耗用，串連的甲烷醱酵槽
之醣類殘餘濃度僅為 2,698 mg COD/L，故甲烷槽主要是分解氫醱酵液態代謝產物 (如乙
酸、丙酸、丁酸…等揮發酸)。出流之氨氮濃度比進流者高，顯示糖蜜的厭養分解會產生
氨氮。

圖 4 操作因子對纖維素厭氧產能的影響 
 
 
3. 操作因子之探討  
(1) pH 
pH 6 為纖維素產氫的最佳初始培養 pH 值，較低的初始 pH 值會抑制厭氧微生物之產
H2 反應；在初始 pH 5 時，產氫能力急劇下降，甚至沒有氫氣產生(圖 3)。Zhang et al.(2003)
以澱粉厭氧醱酵產氫依研究，也有相同現象。 
(2) 溫度 
纖維素厭氧醱酵產能的最適操作溫度為 40oC (圖 4)；於 60～70 oC 培養，可有效抑制甲
烷菌，但也可能抑制產氫菌和產醇菌的活性(表 16)。 
(3) 菌種前處理 
各類微生物有各自的生長環境條件，將菌種作前處理以抑制非產氫菌之活性，可以使
產氫菌種成為優勢。加熱方法則常被應用來篩選取自各種厭氧混合菌群之產氫菌種，且能
有效地抑制甲烷菌。本實驗結果顯示，熱篩處理和未處理厭氧菌群的產氫效果還是明顯優
於酸篩和鹼篩兩種前處理之結果。酸篩可有效抑制甲烷菌的活性，但產氫菌活性也可能被
抑制，故降低產氫能力。鹼篩處理則不會完全抑制甲烷菌的活性，但也影響了產氫能力。
最佳產能操作條件的組合為中興污泥、纖維素濃度 20 g COD/L、50 oC、pH 6 和熱篩菌種。 
(4) 纖維素濃度 
纖維素濃度 20 g COD/L 有最大的產能(圖 4)。先前的研究結果也顯示，纖維素濃度於
20～30 g COD/L，氫氣產率就會達到峰值(黃，2006)。

三、 心得與建議 
目前國內與國外對氫能源相關的研究多屬片段，如產氫、儲氫及氫能源轉換
與應用，極少有綜合性包含技術、社會、經濟與教育面整體的氫能源研發與探討。
韓國 KIER 在政府大力協助下(USD 100 M/yr，為期 10 年)，將生質產氫技術與業
界結合，並成功建立儲氫系統與加氫站、氫能巴士等設施，除了使氫能技術朝應
用面更往前邁一大步外，亦讓社會大眾未來對「氫能社會」有初步的瞭解。 
台灣(逢甲大學生物厭氧產氫研究團隊)所開發之產氫技術尚屬國際領先地
位，為持續保持國際領先地位，政府應持續推動生物產氫研究計畫，以加速產氫
技術量產目標，整合國內儲氫及氫能源轉換與應用技術，並鼓勵民間企業參與投
資，朝「潔淨能源-氫能台灣」目標邁進。

Abstract 
The effects of pH and substrate concentrations on fermentative hydrogen 
production from preserved fruits soaking solution was investigated by response surface 
methodology. Anaerobic wastewater sludge obtained from a paper mill factory was used 
as the seed sludge. The experiments of pH and substrate concentrations effects were 
conducted at pH 4–8 and 1.24-6.20 g COD/L, respectively. Batch experimental results 
indicate that hydrogen production yield peaked with 2.64 mol H2/mol glucose at a 
soaking solution concentration of 3.72 g COD/L and pH 6 without nutrient. Comparing 
the hydrogen production with other actual wastewaters, using waste soaking solution as 
the substrate could obtain high hydrogen production yield. Throughout this study, the 
hydrogen gas content in the biogas was from 3.3 to 50.6 % and no methane was 
observed. According to the response surface analysis, the peak hydrogen yield and H2 
concentration were obtained at pH 6.0. High ethanol concentration was obtained at high 
substrate concentration and pH. The maximum total volatile fatty acid concentrations 
were obtained at high substrate concentration and low pH (without nutrients) but 
obtained at the soaking solution concentration of 6.0 g COD/L and pH 6.5 (nutrients 
addition).

1. Introduction 
 51
fatty acids (VFAs) production at the 68 h cultivation and their compositions were 
determined. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
Two series of batch experiments were conducted. The hydrogen production 
potential was tested (1) without nutrients (Run 1-10) and (2) with adding nutrients (Run 
11-20) to determine the need for nutrient addition (Table 1). The fed medium contained 
sufficient inorganic supplements including NH4HCO3 (5240 mg/l), K2HPO4 (125 mg/l), 
MgCl2•6H2O (100 mg/l), MnSO4•6H2O (15 mg/l), FeSO4•7H2O (25 mg/l), 
CuSO4•5H2O (5 mg/l), CoCl2•5H2O (0.125 mg/l), and NaHCO3 (6720 mg/l) [4]. 
2.3. Analytical method 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods [5] were used to determine pH, 
ORP and VSS concentration of liquid content. Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a 
gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). 
Biogas volume was determined by a gas meter (Ritter, Germany) and gas composition 
was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector (China 
Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the VFA, ethanol and biogas assays 
were the same as those indicated in our previous studies [2, 6]. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Hydrogen production 
Conversion efficiency represents the hydrogen-producing yield on a defined 
substrate. To evaluate the relationship between substrate concentration and the 
conversion efficiency, the design matrix with the corresponding conversion efficiency in 
Table 1 were subjected to regression analysis, and the regression equation and ternary 
figure were generated as shown in Table 2 and Figs. 1~2. The hydrogen gas content in 
the biogas was from 3.3 to 50.6 % and no methane was observed. In Table 1, the 
hydrogen production yield and concentration in Run 1~10 (without nutrient) were 
higher than that of Run 11~20 (with nutrient). This result indicates that the soaking 
solution itself contained enough nutrients for hydrogen fermentation.  
The hydrogen production yield peaked with 2.64 mol H2/mol glucose at the 
soaking solution concentration of 3.72 g COD/L and pH 6 without nutrient (Table 1). 
The hydrogen production yields of some actual wastewaters were summarized in Table 
3. Comparing the hydrogen production with other actual wastewaters, using waste 
soaking solution as the substrate could obtain high hydrogen production yield (2.64 mol 
H2/mol glucose).  
pH is one of the key process parameters affecting hydrogen production because it

4. Conclusion 
The followings can be concluded from the experimental results. 
1. Preserved fruits soaking solution could be used to produce hydrogen without any nutrient addition. 
2. The hydrogen production yield peaked with 2.64 mol H2/mol glucose at the soaking solution 
concentration of 3.72 g COD/L and pH 6 without nutrient. Comparing the hydrogen production with 
other actual wastewaters, using waste soaking solution as the substrate could obtain high hydrogen 
production yield. 
3. High ethanol concentration was obtained at high preserved soaking solution concentration and pH. 
Nutrient addition affected VFA concentrations. The maximum total VFA concentrations were 
obtained at high substrate concentration and low pH (without nutrients) but obtained at the soaking 
solution concentration of 6.0 g COD/L and pH 6.5 (nutrients addition).

hydrogen production is well used (Lin et al., 2000; Li and Fang, 2007). Moreover, each organism 
has a pH range within which growth is possible and this pH range usually has a well-defined pH 
optimum (Brock et al., 1994). In any biohydrogen production system, pH affects process 
efficiency in terms of substrate utilization, hydrogen production activity, and distribution of liquid 
product or microbial community. To what extents pH affects rice straw-degrading mixed 
anaerobic microflora for hydrogen production has seldom been elucidated.  
Based on these considerations, this research was aimed at investigating the 
hydrogen–producing bioactivity of non pretreatment and thermal enriched anaerobic mixed 
microflora at various initial cultivation pH values for batch-fermenting rice straw. Specifically, 
the effects of these factors on hydrogen gas content and hydrogen yield (the ability converting 
starch into hydrogen, HY) were determined. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Seed sludge and Substrate 
The seed sludge was obtained from two municipal sewage treatment plants (Sludges W1 and 
W2), cow dung compost (Sludge C) and a paper manufacture plant (Sludge T1). The seed thermal 
enrichment was pre-treating the sludges with heat at 95℃ for 40 minutes. Seed sludges without 
thermal pretreatment were used as the comparisons.  
The rice straw was obtained from a rice field in middle Taiwan. Using a pulverizer to smash 
the rice straw as the substrate that passed through the 0.297 mm sieve. The substrate rice straw 
concentration was 30 g straw/L (W/V). The fed medium contained sufficient inorganic 
supplements (mg/l) including NH4HCO3 5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, 
FeSO4•7H2O 25, CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125 and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1985). 
2.2. Experimental design and procedure 
Hydrogen-production batch experiments were performed in serum vials with a working 
volume of 125 ml. The vials were initially gassed with argon gas followed by seed microflora (25 
ml) and substrate (20 ml) addition. The vials were placed in a reciprocal air-bath shaker (150 rpm) 
with the temperature controlled at 55 ± 1◦C. In the Experiment I, the initial cultivation pH and 
temperature were controlled at 6.5 and 55℃, respectively. In the Experiment II, the initial 
cultivation pH values were from 3.5 to 8.0 with an interval of 0.5 units. The total gas and total 
VFAs production at the 68 h cultivation and their compositions were determined. Each 
experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
2.3. Analytical method 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine pH, 
oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express biomass) 
concentrations of liquid content. Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph 
having a flame ionization detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by 
a gas meter (Ritter, Germany) and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph 
having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details 
for the VFAs, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in our previous studies

The liquid product produced by the anaerobic sludge without thermal enrichment is 
summarized in Table 3. The VFAs were acetate (HAc, 506-1698 mg COD/L), propionate (HPr, 
104-358 mg COD/L), butyrate (HBu, 116-414 mg COD/L) and valerate (HVa, 19-70) and ethanol 
(EtOH, 43-98) showing HAc was the dominant one. Many works also reveal that the main 
products are acetate and butyrate in the fermentation of carbohydrate by Clostridium species and 
most are of butyrate-pathway (Lin et al., 2006). However, the present results reveal that hydrogen 
production from rice straw was of acetate-pathway. 
Table 4 summarizes the liquid products produced from fermenting rice straw using the 
thermal enrichment sludges to generate hydrogen. The VFAs were HAc (3070-4261 mg COD/L), 
HPr (228-486 mg COD/L), iso-butyric acid (i-HBu, 63-208 mg COD/L), HBu (283-494 mg 
COD/L) and HVa (64-303 mg COD/L) and ethanol (EtOH, 768-1042 mg COD/L) with HAc the 
dominant one. Iso-HBu was determined. Comparing the VFA concentrations produced by these 
two pretreated seed sludges, it is known that the thermal enrichment sludge produced the liquid 
products in an increasing tendency except that of HBu by Sludge W1. Table 5 reveals the 
concentration increments of the liquid products by the thermally-enriched sludge showing 
thermal treatment enhancing liquid product production by 114-391%. However, the HBu 
concentration produced by Sludge W1 was reduced by 32% when the seed sludge was 
thermally-treated. Noted that thermally-treated Sludge W1 was the only seed sludge that had a 
decrease in hydrogen production when compared with that of non thermal-treated sludge (Table 
1). These results reveal that Sludge W1 contained some specific microorganisms different from 
the other seed sludges.

The experimental results indicated that hydrogen production from rice straw by sewage 
sludge microflora was of acetate-fermentation type. Sludge W1 contained special species that can 
directly degrade rice straw and produce hydrogen. Hydrogen production from rice straw by 
mixed anaerobic microflora was initial cultivation pH-dependent; heat-treatment on seed sludge 
could enhance hydrogen production. The optimal pH values for Sludge W1 to produce hydrogen 
were around 6.0-7.0 with peak HY of 7.4 ml/g. The thermal treatment of Sludge W1 enhanced 
liquid product production by 114-391%.

INTRODUCTION 
Kyoto Protocol was held in 1998 to promote the use of renewable energy sources, 
including biomass, geothermal, solar and wind. The target is to reduce the carbon 
dioxide emissions to 2000 levels by 2020. The renewable energy development plan of 
Taiwan aims to replace 10 percent of the total energy supply with renewable energy 
sources by 2010. The plan includes a number of incentives, such as government funding 
for up to 50 percent of installation fees for wind or solar energy systems. Some 
alternative energy sources are already up and running just like wind plant. The first 
wind plant already started operating in December 2004. Another potential renewable 
energy source is the sun. According to the bureau, more than 320,000 households have 
installed solar water heaters, and the total area covered by solar panels today is 1.3 
million square meters. However, the climate limits the efficiency of solar water heaters, 
which better suit the sunnier southern part of the island. Fermentative hydrogen 
production by anaerobic bacteria is recognized as the most promising biological route 
for hydrogen production due to its ability to convert biomass and organic wastes into 
valuable hydrogen energy. This H2 production method appears to endorse great potential 
for commercial applications. 
The main agricultural products in Taiwan include hogs, rice, poultry, shrimp, eels, squid, 
tuna, granulated sugar and bananas. There is enough to both satisfy the domestic market 
and still have some left over for export. This study the potential for biohydrogen 
production from agricultural wastes using anaerobic mixed microflora. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Hydrogen-producing sludge and fermentation medium 
The seed sludge was obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant located in 
central Taiwan. The collected wastewater sludge was heat-treated by 100◦C for 45 min 
to inhibit the methanogenic activity and select H2-producing spore-forming bacteria 
(Lin et al., 2006; Li and Fang, 2007). The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to 
express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the seed sludge 
were 7.5, 36.0 g/l and 67.2 g/l, respectively. The agricultural wastes were collected from 
a fertilizer company in Taichung, Taiwan and then stored at 4℃ before the experiment. 
The agricultural wastes were coffee waste (W1), guava waste (W2), mange waste (W3), 
Litchi waste (W4), and papaya waste (W5). The characteristic of these wastes are 
shown in Table 1.  
 
 
 69
RESULTS 
The accumulative hydrogen production of Mango waste was 3 times greater than that of 
Papaya waste. Figure 1 shows that hydrogen was produced in 20 h, which means that 
agricultural waste is very suitable for fermentative hydrogen production. The initial pH 
was controlled at 6.7. After fermentation the final pH decreased to 5.92-6.34. The 
hydrogen concentration of the batch test reached 10.7-12.0 %, but coffee waste only 4 
%.  The hexose degradation was 61-94 % for these wastes. This is only a preliminary 
test and in-depth research is necessary.

Abstract 
This study was aimed to investigate the effects of initial cultivation pH (4.5-10) and 
substrate concentration (6.24-56.25 g COD/L) on the H2 production from agricultural 
wastes by heat-treated sewage sludge inoculums. Four synthetic agricultural wastes 
were used as the substrates: banana fresh, banana peel, orange fresh and orange peel. 
The hydrogen fermentation was in batch at 35oC. The experimental results showed 
that the mixed microflora could produce hydrogen from the banana and orange wastes. 
The highest maximum hydrogen production rate 244 mmol H2/L/d, maximum specific 
hydrogen production rate 43 mmol H2/g VSS/d, and hydrogen yield 3.2 mmol H2/g 
COD substrate peaked at an initial pH of 7.0 and banana fresh of 50 g COD/L. Ethanol 
and butyrate were the major metabolites in biohydrogen fermentation from the 
agricultural wastes.  
 
Keywords: Agricultural waste; Biohydrogen production; pH; substrate 
concentration. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Carbohydrates are good feedstock sources for fermentative hydrogen production. Solid 
wastes, wastewaters or agricultural residues rich in carbohydrates could serve as cheap 
and abundant feedstocks for fermentative hydrogen production (Kapdan and Kargi, 
2006). There are more than 5 million tones of agricultural waste produced annually in 
Taiwan. Utilization of the agricultural waste could efficiently reduce the waste 
disposal/treatment problems. Sewage sludge containing variety of microflora is a 
potential source for obtaining dark fermentative H2-producing microorganisms (Lin and 
 75
water until 1 L (0.15 w/v). The TCOD concentrations, VSS, and moisture contents of 
the four synthetic agricultural wastes ranged from 21.5-48.5 g COD/L, 7.4-20.5 g/L, 
and 75-90 %, respectively (Table 1).   
 
Experimental design and procedure 
Batch hydrogen production experiments were performed in serum bottles (a volume of 
125 ml) with anaerobic head space. Argon gassed serum vial was added with 
sludge-inoculum of 30 ml and an  agricultural waste solution of 25 ml and pH 
adjusting solution (1 N HCl or 1N NaOH) of 5 ml. The vials were placed in a reciprocal 
air-bath shaker (150 rpm) with a cultivation temperature of 35 ± 1◦C.  
Three series of batch experiments were conducted. In the early stages of this study, 
banana fresh (BF), banana peel (BP), orange fresh (OF), and orange peel (OP) 
feedstocks were prepared at 40 g COD/L. The tested pH values were 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 
6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0; substrate concentrations were from 6.25 to 56.25 g COD/L 
from the highest hydrogen productivity of the waste obtained at the first stage 
experiment. The volume and composition of digestion gas and volatile fatty acids 
(VFAs) concentrations were determined after 104~107 h cultivation. 
The nutrient solution contained the following inorganic supplements (mg/l): NH4HCO3 
5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, FeSO4•7H2O 25, 
CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125, and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1982). Each 
experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine 
pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and VSS concentration of liquid content. 
Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization 
detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a gas tight 
syringe and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal 
conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the 
VFA, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in our previous studies 
(Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et al., 2006). Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to 
measure carbohydrate (Dubois et al., 1956). 
 
Data analysis 
The hydrogen activity was evaluated using the hydrogen productivity and HPR. These 
two values were determined based on the hydrogen production potential and maximum 
 77
methane and the carbohydrate degradations were from 37 to 91 %. Based on the 
modified Gompertz equation parameters, the lag-phase time was less than 20 h with the 
exception of pH 10.0 (Table 5). The highest HPRm (244 mmol H2/L/d) and SHPRm (43 
mmol H2/g VSS/d) peaked at initial pH 7.0 as well as HY (3.2 mmol H2/g COD 
substrate). This HPRm result was higher than that (220 mmol H2/L/d) of hydrogen 
fermentation from glucose with initial pH 6.2(Salerno et al., 2006). 
Using the optimal initial 7.0 for hydrogen production, the hydrogen production 
performance of cultures with various substrate concentrations of 6.25–56.25 g COD/L 
was investigated. The results clearly indicate that a BF concentration of 50.00 g COD/L 
exhibited the best performance in hydrogen production for the most of categories 
compared in Table 7, especially for the HPRm and SHPRm values. Table 6 and 7 indicate 
that the H2 productivity (H2 evolution, HPRm and SHPRm) increased as the BF 
concentration increased from 6.25 to 50.00 g COD/L, while they decreased slightly 
when the substrate concentration was 30 g COD/L. Fig 2 and Table 7 showed that the 
lag-phase time was less than 20 h. The hydrogen content in the biogas was higher than 
35 % with the exception of BF waste at 6.25 and 12.50 g COD/L (Table 6).   
 
Productions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol at different pH and 
substrate concentrations 
The formation of hydrogen is accompanied with VFA or solvent production during an 
anaerobic fermentation process. The production of liquid products reflects the 
metabolism of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Therefore, the VFAs and solvent 
concentration distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring 
hydrogen production (Chen et al, 2002). The environmental factors such as pH and 
substrate concentration affect the metabolic pathway during dark fermentative hydrogen 
production (Lin et al., 2006; Lay et al., 2007).  
The soluble metabolic product (SMP) included acetate (HAc), propionate (HPr), 
iso-butyrate (i-HBu), n-butyrate (n-HBu), and ethanol (EtOH). Fig 2 indicated that the 
SMP concentrations increased as pH increased from 4.5 to 7.0, which values gave peak 
H2 productivity. However, SMP concentrations decreased with pH ＞ 7.0. Ethanol is 
another important liquid fermentation product being used as an energy carrier. At high 
pHs of 7-10, ethanol concentration was quite high (9.0-10.0 g COD/L) at BF 
concentration 50 g COD/L. In the presented study, butyrate fermentation type reaction 
also resulted in efficient hydrogen production (Lin et al., 2006). At pH 6.0-8.0, higher 
HPRm (132-244 mmol H2/L/d) were determined with major metabolite of butyrate 
(i-HBu + n-HBu, 46-72 %).

the future because it can be efficiently converted into electricity via fuel cell technology 
and is also cleanly combustible without formation of CO2 (Das and Verzioglu, 2001; 
Levin et al., 2004). Biological hydrogen production via direct/indirect water 
biophotolysis or dark/photo fermentation (Das and Verzioglu, 2001) is an energy 
effective and environmentally friendly route of producing H2 (Claassen et al., 2005). 
Among them, dark fermentation is considered as the most commercially feasible 
biological means of producing H2 due to its high H2 production rate and an additional 
benefit of waste reduction (Levin et al., 2004). 
The biohydrogen research team in Feng Chia University has successfully developed an 
effective screening method for indigenous hydrogen-producing bacterial strains as well 
as a high-rate hydrogen-producing process of agitated granular sludge bed reactor 
(AGSBR) system. This system has a high chemical reaction rate due to effective contact 
among the reacting phases with higher heat and mass transfer (Lee et al., 2004; Chen et 
al., 2002; Chang et al., 2001) compared to other processes. The hydrogen production 
rate of the CIGSB system reached 7.2 mol H2/L/d, which is 4-fold higher than the 
reported values. This achievement indicates the world-leading role of biohydrogen 
production technology.  This technology was financially supported by Bureau of 
Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, and is to be commercialized. Therefore, 
a 300 L fermenter pilot plant of this system has been constructed for developing the 
scale-up operation parameters. The present work introduces the pilot plant technology.  
This development widens the range of applications of the biohydrogen technology and 
provides valuable information that able to facilitate commercialization of the 
fermentative hydrogen production processes.  In addition, the outcome of this work 
would be of great help in ensuring the pivotal role of Taiwan in global development of 
biohydrogen technology. 
 
 
THE FLOW SHEET OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM 
Most hydrogen fermentation has been conducted in well-mixed systems, such as 
anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, continuously stirred tank reactor, carrier-induced 
granular sludge bed, membrane bioreactor and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket.  
However, when the biological system was operating at short hydraulic retention time, 
washout of suspended cells might occur and results in operational instability and

MAIN UNITS 
The hydrogen fermentation system has five main units and their facilities are listed in 
Table 1. 
Feedstock Feeding 
During a lab-scale experiment, substrate and nutrients are generally mixed-up and 
stored at a refrigerator for usage. However, it is energy-consuming for a practical-scale 
hydrogen fermentation system. Therefore, a new feedstock feeding method with ease 
and energy-saving operation was tested. Carbon source and nutrient were separately 
stored but mixed-up before being fed into the fermenter. Two backup storage tanks were 
used for these two influents. With this feed method, substrate refrigeration was 
unnecessary and the loading for substrate preparation was well reduced.

4. It had a rectangular observation glass window for observing the liquid flow and 
granules. The fermentor installed a warm water jacket for temperature control. 
 
Gas-liquid separation unit 
1. This unit had a set of gas-liquid separation tank with a volume of 400 L (working 
volume, 300 L). 
2. The height-diameter ratio of the tank was 2:1.  
3. Gas and liquid separation was gravitational. Biogas (H2 + CO2) went into back-end 
collector and liquid was discharged into the wastewater treatment plant. 
 
Mechanical and electrical integration system 
1. This integration system contained a central control room and a central control panel.  
2. Except for the feed preparation, the other units were manipulated by the 
auto-control system.  
3. The system control panel could control and detect the motor speed, temperature, 
solenoid valve switch, fluid flow, pressure, and hydrogen concentration of the 
environment. This monitoring system could detect and record the data and draw a 
chart. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Pilot plants are used to reduce the risk for developing a commercialized plant. The pilot 
plants are substantially less expensive than a full-scale plant. The pilot plant can provide 
valuable data for designing a full-scale plant. Scientific data about reaction process, 
hydrodynamic behaviour in the system and bacterial community will be available from 
the pilot plant operation.

wind plant already started operating in December 2004. Another potential renewable 
energy source is the sun. According to the bureau, more than 320,000 households have 
installed solar water heaters, and the total area covered by solar panels today is 1.3 
million square meters. However, the climate limits the efficiency of solar water heaters, 
which better suit the sunnier southern part of the island. Fermentative hydrogen 
production by anaerobic bacteria is recognized as the most promising biological route 
for hydrogen production due to its ability to convert biomass and organic wastes into 
valuable hydrogen energy. This H2 production method appears to endorse great potential 
for commercial applications. 
The main agricultural products in Taiwan include hogs, rice, poultry, shrimp, eels, squid, 
tuna, granulated sugar and bananas. There is enough to both satisfy the domestic market 
and still have some left over for export. This study the potential for biohydrogen 
production from agricultural wastes using anaerobic mixed microflora. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Hydrogen-producing sludge and fermentation medium 
The seed sludge was obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant located in 
central Taiwan. The collected wastewater sludge was heat-treated by 100◦C for 45 min 
to inhibit the methanogenic activity and select H2-producing spore-forming bacteria 
(Lin et al., 2006; Li and Fang, 2007). The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to 
express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the seed sludge 
were 7.5, 36.0 g/l and 67.2 g/l, respectively. The agricultural wastes were collected from 
a fertilizer company in Taichung, Taiwan and then stored at 4℃ before the experiment. 
The agricultural wastes were coffee waste (W1), guava waste (W2), mange waste (W3), 
Litchi waste (W4), and papaya waste (W5). The characteristic of these wastes are 
shown in Table 1.

The modified Gompertz equation was used to describe the progress of cumulative 
hydrogen production (Lay et al., 1999).  The cumulative hydrogen production data 
obtained from these batch experiments was used to fit the modified Gompertz equation. 
The correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.87 to 0.912. The λ values were low 
showing microorganisms do not need adaptation time to the agricultural wastes.

Chang, 1999). Determining the hydrogen production potential of agricultural wastes 
enhances the efficient usage of these wastes. 
Previous studies have shown that the anaerobic bacteria obtained from sewage sludge 
could convert synthetic and sugar-rich wastewaters into biohydrogen (Lin and Chang, 
1999; Lin and Lay, 2005; Lo et al., 2006). pH and substrate concentration are the key 
process parameters affecting hydrogen production because they directly affect 
hydrogen-producing activity (Lin et al., 2006; Lay et al., 2007). Yu et al. (2006) 
suggests that concentration of carbon substrates (or organic loading) in wastewater had 
a slightly negative effect on the hydrogen yield (HY). However, the specific hydrogen 
production rate (HPR) substantially increased with increasing substrate concentration. 
In some cases, high substrate concentration might be unfavourable for hydrogen 
production due to substrate inhibition. On the other hand, since pH affects the growth 
rate of microorganisms, pH changes might cause drastic shifts in the relative population 
numbers of different species in the heterogeneous hydrogen-producing reactors 
(Horiuchi et al., 1999). A pH range is reported optimal for fermentation of 
carbohydrates by mixed bacterial cultures (Li and Fang, 2007). It is important to obtain 
the optimal cultivation substrate concentration and pH for hydrogen production using 
mixed microflora. 
In our present work, several sludges rich in hydrogen producers were used because they 
could convert xylose and sucrose into hydrogen effectively (Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et 
al., 2006). This study was aimed to investigate the the effects of the environmental 
factors of initial cultivation pH and substrate concentration on the H2 production from 
agricultural wastes by heat-treated sewage sludge inoculums. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Hydrogen-producing sludge and fermentation medium 
The seed sludge was obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant located in 
central Taiwan. The collected wastewater sludge was heat-treated by 100◦C for 45 min 
to inhibit the methanogenic activity and select H2-producing spore-forming bacteria 
(Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et al., 2006; Li and Fang, 2007). The pH, volatile suspended 
solids (VSS, to express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of 
the seed sludge were 7.5, 35.2 g/l and 65.1 g/l, respectively. The synthetic agricultural 
wastes were bananas and oranges from a supermarket in Taichung, Taiwan. The peel 
and fresh were minced individually by a juicer as pulps and then used in this study. For 
measured the TCOD (total chemical oxygen demands) concentration and VSS, each 
agricultural waste of 150 g was added into a volumetric flask and then filled deionized

RESULTS 
 
Hydrogen production from agricultural wastes 
Anaerobic hydrogen production bacteria cultured at substrate concentration 35.00 g 
COD/L and initial pH 7.0 for biohydrogen production from the agricultural wastes. 
Table 2 illustrates that the cumulative hydrogen productions were from 63 to 135 ml and 
the hydrogen contents were from 22 to 40 % without methane. There was considerable 
variation in both the TCOD and carbohydrate concentrations of the agricultural wastes 
with 28-77 and 37 - 91 %, respectively. The final pHs were 4.4 - 6.4 after 104 h 
cultivation. 
The modified Gompertz equation was fitted into hydrogen production curves to estimate 
the biogas production rate and the lag-phase time. The highest maximum hydrogen 
production rates (HPRm, 133 and 139 mmol H2/L/d) and specific maximum hydrogen 
production rates (SHPRm, 23 and 24 mmol H2/g VSS/d) were obtained from BF and 
BF+OF wastes, respectively (Table 3). The highest hydrogen production yield of more 
than 2 mmol H2/g COD substrate peaked in all the fresh wastes (BF, OF, and BF+OF). 
The average lag-phase time prior to exponential H2 production was 9.3 h with the 
exception for the blank. In this experiment, the highest hydrogen productivity peaked 
with BP. Therefore, BP was used as the substrate to investigate the effects of pHs and 
substrate concentrations on biohydrogen production. 
 
Hydrogen production at different pH and substrate concentrations  
The profiles of cumulative H2 production from BF at an initial pH of 4.5-10.0 with a 
substrate concentration of 50.00 g COD/L are illustrated in Fig 1, which clearly shows 
that H2 production at initial pH 7.0 was much more effective than those at others. Table 
4 showed that the hydrogen gas content in the product gas was higher than 30 % with no 
 107 
The ethanol distribution of SMP for all the BF concentrations (6.25-56.25 g COD/L) 
was very high (34-57 %), followed by butyrate (i-HBu + n-HBu) of 14-52 % (Fig 3). 
The production of acetate and propionate was also significant with 1.45-2.09 and 
0.05-6.0 g COD/L at various BF concentrations, respectively (Fig 3). These results 
indicated that high BF concentrations favored butyrate-type fermentation during 
hydrogen conversion. Similar results have been reported (Tao et al., 2007). 
 
DISCUSSION 
The degree of pH reduction depended on many factors such as substrate and sludge 
concentrations, temperature, duration, and so on. Many studies reported the optimal 
initial pH values for hydrogen activity at neutral pH range of 6.5-8.0 (Lin and Lay, 2005; 
Lay et al., 2007; Lin and Lay, 2004a; Lin and Lay, 2004b). Lin et al. (2006) reported 
that the optimal initial pH of cultures for hydrogen production was 6.5 with peak values 
of HY 1.3 mol H2/mol xylose and HPRm 0.25 mol H2/L/day. Kawano et al. also showed 
that the optimal initial cultivation pH was 6.5 and 7.0 for hydrogen production (Kawano 
et al., 2004). 
Sewage sludge is a good source of H2-producers for the fermentation of carbohydrates. 
Clostridia sp. were the dominant H2-producers in mixed cultures enriched from sewage 
sludge and their metabolic pathway from organic materials were shown in Fig 4. 
Butyrate and acetate were the two main products, while low pH seemed to favor 
butyrate production. Propionate production increased substantially at pH 7.0 and above 
(Antonopoulou et al., 2007). We obtained similar results in this study. 
Organic acids are produced during the dark fermentation of carbohydrate and they could 
be converted into hydrogen and CO2 by photo-fermentative bacteria. Higher hydrogen 
production yields could be obtained when two systems are combined (Yokoi et al., 1998; 
Yokoi et al., 2002). Combining dark and photo-fermentation processes seems to be the 
most attractive approach that could result in high hydrogen yields for carbohydrate-rich 
wastes. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results. The mixed 
microflora could produce hydrogen from the agricultural wastes of banana and orange. 
The highest HPRm (317 mmol H2/L/d), SHPRm (56 mmol H2/g VSS/d), and HY (3.7 
mmol H2/g COD substrate) peaked at initial pH of 7.0 and banana fresh of 50 g COD/L. 
The ethanol and butyrate were the major SMP in biohydrogen fermentation of banana 
fresh.

Abstract 
Hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier of the future. Dark fermentation is 
considered the most commercially feasible biological mean of producing H2 due to its 
high H2 production rate. The biohydrogen research team in Feng Chia University, 
Taiwan has successfully developed an effective screening method for indigenous 
hydrogen-producing bacterial strains as well as a high-rate hydrogen producing process 
of agitated granular sludge bed reactor system. This world-record high-rate system is to 
be commercialized. Therefore, a 300 L pilot plant of this system has been constructed 
for developing the scale-up operation parameters. The present work introduces the pilot 
plant technology.

INTRODUCTION 
The utilization of fossil fuels causes global climate change, environmental pollution, 
and health problems (Hallenbeck and Benemann 2002) mainly due to increasing 
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This 
has been strictly prohibited globally according to “Kyoto protocol” effective on 
February 16, 2005.  Many research and development approaches have been 
implemented to reduce CO2 emissions. Among them, photosynthetic process enabling 
CO2 fixation by microalgae is the most effective, natural and energy-saving way of 
reducing CO2 in the environment. Hydrogen is considered as an ideal energy carrier of 
 117 
granular sludge bed reactor system to enhance cell retention and enable formation of 
self-flocculated granular cells/sludge. 
The pilot plant layout was divided into five section areas including preparation tank, 
mixing system, fermentor, gas/liquid separator and automatic control system (Figures 1 
and 2).

1. Introduction 
It is well know that carbohydrates are the main source of hydrogen during 
fermentation processes and therefore waste/wastewater or agricultural residues rich in 
carbohydrates can be considered as potential sources of hydrogen [1]. Mixed anaerobic 
microfloras obtained from sewage sludge are well used for fermentative hydrogen 
production [2]. Preserved fruits are a kind of Chinese traditional snacks. A large amount 
of sugar is used in the manufacturing process but the soaking solution that contained 
high sugar concentration is almost discarded. Sugar is a good material for fermentative 
hydrogen. The waste soaking solution, therefore, was used to produce hydrogen gas in 
this study.  
    The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the environmental 
factors of initial cultivation pH and substrate concentration on clostridia-rich natural 
anaerobe germination for hydrogen production. In this study, a full-factorial 
central-composite experimental design [3] was employed in planning the experiments 
for learning the effects of pH and substrate concentration on the hydrogen production in 
a batch fermentor feeding preserved fruits soaking solution. For determining which 
experimental variable settings will affect hydrogen production, the response-surface 
methodology [3] was employed to determine and explain the conditions required for 
efficient hydrogen production. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Seed sludge and Substrate 
Anaerobic wastewater sludge obtained from a paper mill factory was used as the 
seed sludge. The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express the biomass 
concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the seed sludge were 7.5, 35.2 g/l and 
65.1 g/l, respectively. Heating at 100◦C for 45 min was used to treat the collected sludge 
to inhibit methane-producing bacteria activity. The soaking solution is from a preserved 
fruits manufactory in central Taiwan. The pH, sugar and chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) of the soaking solution were 4.0, 620 g/L and 500 g COD/L. 
2.2. Experimental design and procedure 
Hydrogen-production experiments were performed in serum vials with a working 
volume of 125 ml, using a batch test. The vials were initially gassed with argon gas 
followed by seed microflora (30 ml) and substrate (25 ml) addition. The vials were 
placed in a reciprocal air-bath shaker (150 rpm) with the temperature controlled at 35 ± 
1◦C. The tested pH values were 4–8 in an interval of 1 units. The substrate 
 125 
pH is one of the key process parameters affecting hydrogen production because it 
may directly affect the hydrogen-producing activity [7]. According to the response 
surface analysis, the peak hydrogen production yield and H2 concentration were 
obtained at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1). This indicates that the maximum hydrogen generation 
efficiency from preserved fruits soaking solution occurred at the pH range of 5.5~6.5, 
similar to the hydrogen fermentation from glucose [6] and sugar-rich wastewater (Table 
3). Kawano et al.[8] also reported that when the initial pH of cultures were adjusted to 
6.5 and 7.0 (uncontrolled), the pH value further decreased to a suitable pH condition 
(around 6) for hydrogen fermentation. 
3.2. Productions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol 
The formation of hydrogen is accompanied with VFA or solvent production during 
an anaerobic fermentation process. The production of these liquid products reflects the 
metabolism of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Therefore, the VFA and solvent 
concentration distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring 
hydrogen production [11]. 
The concentrations of the main metabolic products measured at 68 h are 
summarized in Table 1. The dominant VFAs were acetic (HAc, 377~1988 mg COD/L), 
propionate (HPr, 5~350 mg COD/L) and butyric acids (HBu, 153~1412 mg COD/L). To 
understand the relationship between the productions of hydrogen and TVFA, the TVFA 
and EtOH-producing contour lines against pH and substrate concentrations were plotted 
using the response surface analysis (Fig. 2). Many works also reveal that sewage sludge 
is a good seed microflora source for cultivating hydrogen-producing bacteria for 
efficient hydrogen fermentation using carbohydrate. Clostridium species were found to 
be the dominant microorganisms in incubated sewage sludge. Similar observations were 
found that the main products are acetate and butyrate in the fermentation of 
carbohydrate by Clostridium species [11]. 
The maximum TVFA concentrations were obtained at high substrate concentration 
and low pH (without nutrients) but obtained at a soaking solution concentration of 6.0 g 
COD/L and pH 6.5 (nutrients addition) (Fig. 2). Ethanol is another important liquid 
fermentation product being used as an energy resource. High ethanol concentration was 
obtained at high values of preserved soaking solution concentration and pH. Lin et al. 
[11] reported that the main fermentation product was ethanol at pH 8. Moreover, pH and 
substrate concentration could affect the metabolic pathway during hydrogen production. 
On the other hand, nutrient concentration also influences the concentration of 
metabolites. The strategies such as properly controlling nutrient [12], 
carbon/nitrogen-ratio [13], carbonate and phosphate concentration [14] could be used to

Abstract 
This study aimed at investigating the effects of seed thermal enrichment and initial cultivation 
pH on fermentative hydrogen production from rice straw by a batch test using vial serum 
bioreactors. The cumulative hydrogen production amounts were 16, 2, 3 and 2 ml for the raw 
sludges W1, W2, C and T1, respectively; methane amounts were 0, 32, 27 and 36 ml, respectively. 
However, thermal-enriched sludge W1, W2, C and T1 had higher hydrogen production with the 
amounts of 13, 16, 4 and 9 ml, respectively; no methane was detected. The liquid products for 
municipal sewage W1 contained acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and ethanol; their 
concentration distribution fractions were 70.9, 6.8, 17.4, 2.4 and 2.4 %, respectively. In the pH 
experiments, there was no gas detected for the initial pH values of 3.5 to 5.5. But the hydrogen 
gas amounts were 2.5, 13.4, 10.1, 0.6 and 0.7 ml for the initial cultivation pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 
7.0, 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The experimental results indicated that hydrogen production from 
rice straw by sewage sludge microflora was of acetate-fermentation type. Sludge W1 contained 
special species that can directly degrade rice straw and produce hydrogen. Hydrogen production 
from rice straw by mixed anaerobic microflora was initial cultivation pH-dependent; 
heat-treatment on seed sludge could enhance hydrogen production. The optimal pH values for 
Sludge W1 to produce hydrogen were around 6.0-7.0 with peak HY of 7.4 ml/g. The thermal 
treatment of Sludge W1 enhanced liquid product production by 114-391%.

1. Introduction 
There is 6.5×106 metric tons of agricultural wastes every year in Taiwan and 30% of them is 
rice straw waste. The anaerobic degradation of organics produces volatile fatty acids (VFAs), 
ethanol, hydrogen gas and methane. Disposal of the rice straw waste results in environmental 
pollution problems and squanders natural biomass resources. Hydrogen is a promising candidate 
as an ideal and clean source of energy in the future. It is known that Clostridium species are 
important anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms (Kataoka et al., 1997; Reimann et al., 
1996). Clostridia are spore-forming bacteria and resistant to heat environment (Brock et al., 
1994). Consequently, using thermal pretreatment on seed sludge to obtain dominant microbes for 
 133 
(Lin and Chang, 1999; Chen et al., 2002). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Hydrogen gas production 
Table 1 summarizes the thermal enrichment experimental results (Experiment I) of various 
seed sludges digesting rice straw. For the non thermal treated sludges, the cumulative hydrogen 
production amounts were 16, 2, 3 and 2 ml for W1, W2, C and T1, respectively with methane gas 
amounts of 0, 32, 27 and 36 ml, respectively. However, the thermal-enriched sludges W2, C and 
T1 had higher hydrogen production with 16, 4 and 9 ml, respectively; no methane was detected. 
This reveals that heat treatment on most sludges could enhance hydrogen production from rice 
straw except that of sludge W1. The efficiency of thermal enrichment on enhancing the hydrogen 
production was common in digesting carbohydrate (Lin et al., 2002). Heat-treatment can enrich 
the anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms tolerating high temperature but inhibit other 
bacteria not able to adapt to high temperature. Literature shows that the thermal enrichment can 
enhance most anaerobic sludges to increase hydrogen production (Li and Fang, 2007). Microbial 
analysis indicates that these microorganisms were spore-forming bacteria. Table 1 reveals that 
non-thermal treated sludge (W1) had high hydrogen production showing it contained a special 
microbial species directly degrading the rice straw. Further study on this seed sludge was 
conducted to elucidate its bioactivity.  
Table 2 summarizes the experimental results of initial cultivation pH effects (Experiment II) 
of sludge W1. There was no gas detected for the initial pH values of 3.5 to 5.5. The hydrogen gas 
amounts were 2.5, 13.4, 10.1, 0.6 and 0.7 ml for the initial cultivation pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 
7.5 and 8.0, respectively. In the hydrogen produced pH ranges the ORP values were in the ranges 
favoring hydrogen production. This result reveals that initial cultivation pH affected hydrogen 
production from rice straw and the optimal values were around pH 6.0-7.0. Proper control of 
initial cultivation pH could affect the fermentation pathway and enhance hydrogen production.  
 
3.2. Productions of volatile fatty acids and ethanol 
The formation of hydrogen is accompanied with VFA or solvent production during an 
anaerobic fermentation process. The production of these liquid products reflects the metabolism 
of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Therefore, the VFA and solvent concentration 
distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring hydrogen production (Lin et 
al., 2006).

pilot-scale system was constructed for determining scale-up operation parameters for 
commercializing the bioH2 production technology.  The pilot-scale system was mainly 
composed of feedstock tank, mixing system, fermentor, gas/liquid separator and automatic 
control system. The fermentor was fed with sucrose (20 g COD/L) and operated at 35oC. A 
batch strategy was used for system starting-up. The fermentor was first operated on a batch 
mode for two days and was then switched to a continuous-feeding mode (HRT 12 h) for one 
month. During the continuous operation, pH notably affected H2 production efficiency and 
bacterial community. For the first 14-day operation, the H2 production rate increased from 0.017 
to 0.256 L/L/h with a pH variation from 5.0 to 7.0. The DGGE results indicate the presence of 
two Clostridium species (namely, Clostridium butyricum and C. pasteurianum) in the fermenter, 
whereas stable hydrogen production rate was obtained at pH 5.5-6.0 when C. pasteurianum 
became dominant in the mixed culture.

INTRODUCTION 
Dark fermentation is the most commercially feasible biological method of H2 production due to its high 
production rate. Most hydrogen fermentation has been conducted in well-mixed systems, such as 
anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (Lin and Jo, 2005; Chin et al., 2003), continuously stirred tank reactor 
(Chen et al., 2002; Ueno et al., 2001), carrier-induced granular sludge bed (Lee et al., 2004), membrane 
bioreactor (Liang, 2003; Oh et al., 2004) and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (Chang and Lin, 2006). 
However, when the biological system was operating at short hydraulic retention time (HRT), washout of 
suspended cells might occur, resulting in operational instability and lowering the hydrogen production rate. 
The Feng Chia University (FCU) biohydrogen research team has successfully developed a high-rate 
hydrogen-producing process of agitated granular sludge bed reactor (AGSBR) system capable of operating 
at a very short retention time, while attaining a high biomass concentration. The AGSBR system could 
achieve a world-leading hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 7.3 L/L/h from glucose (Hung et al., 2007). 
This system had a high HPR due to retaining a high biomass concentration in the bioreactor as well as 
enabling effective contact between microorganisms and substrates (Chen et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004; Wu 
et al., 2005) when compared to other processes. Moreover, in lab-scale experiments, substrate and 
nutrients are generally mixed-up and stored at a refrigerator for usage. However, for the purpose of 
cost-effective operation in a commercial-scale hydrogen fermentation system, a new feedstock feeding 
method with simple and energy-saving operation needs to be examined. 
Based on the above considerations, the commercial viability of the AGSBR system is assessed in 
pilot-scale (400 L fermenter) operations. The pilot plant system was constructed to identify scale-up 
operation parameters for practical production of biohydrogen in a commercial scale. A batch strategy was 
also developed for effectively starting-up this pilot-plant system. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Pilot-scale hydrogen fermentation system 
The pilot-scale system possessed five functional units, including feedstock tank, mixing system, fermentor, 
gas/liquid separator and automatic control system (Figure 1). Carbon source and nutrients were separately 
stored but mixed up before being fed into the 400 L fermentor (working volume 380 L). Two backup 
storage tanks were used for these two influents. With this feeding method, substrate refrigeration was 
unnecessary and the laboring for substrate preparation was well reduced. The fermentor was equipped 
 145 
concentration of liquid content. 
 
 
16S rDNA gene based bacteria community structure analysis 
Total genomic DNA of sludge samples which derived from pilot plan was obtained and purified by using 
the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. DNA samples were stored at -20°C prior to PCR reactions. Primer set 
EUB968F (5’-AACGCGAAGAACCTTAC-3’) plus GC-clamp 
(5’-CGCCCGGGGCGCGCCCCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG-3’) and UNIV1392R 
(5’-ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3’) were used for targeting universal-consensus 16S rDNA fragment 
(Nielsen et al., 1999). PCR (polymerase chain reaction) mixtures (50 µL) contained each deoxynucleoside 
triphosphate at a concentration of 200 µM, 1.5 mM MgCl2, each primer at a concentration of 0.2 µM, 1.25 
U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA), and the PCR buffer supplied with the enzyme. The 
amplification consisted of a DNA denaturing step at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation 
at 95°C for 45 s, annealing at 54°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. The cycling included a final 
extension step at 72°C for 3 min to ensure full extension of the product. All PCR operations were 
performed with an automatic thermal cycler iCyclerTM (Bio-Rad, U.S.A.). PCR products were analyzed 
by electrophoresis at 100 V for 30 min through 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. The amplified products were 
visualized under UV light after being stained with ethidium bromide. Before PCR-amplified extracted 
rDNA fragments, sequence variations were assessed by DGGE. The DGGE profile of the PCR-amplified 
DNA was obtained following the method of Muyzer et al. (Muyzer, 1993) using a DCodeTM Universal 
Mutation Detection System (BioRad, U.S.A.). The 6% (w/v) acrylamide solution was used to cast a gel 
with denaturant gradients ranging from 30 to 65%. Electrophoresis was conducted in a 1 × TAE 
(Tris/acetic acid/EDTA) buffer solution at 180 V and 60°C for 5 h. The gels were stained for 10 min with 
ethidium bromide and visualized with UV radiation. The number of operational taxonomic units in each 
sample was defined as the number of DGGE bands. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fermentor performance 
Figure 2 shows the variations in biogas production rate (BPR), HPR, H2 content in biogas, pH, ORP, COD, 
VSS and carbohydrate concentrations during the start-up period in the pilot fermenter. At the beginning, 
there are two sensors for pH and ORP controls in the middle and bottom of the fermentor, respectively. 
The middle and bottom pH values were very close, but the bottom ORP values were lower than those of 
middle. During the batch operation, the pH was much higher than 6.0 and ORP varied from -200 mV to 
-400 mV with low biogas production. The carbohydrate concentrations decreased from 14 g/L to 2 g/L 
along with a biomass concentrations increasing from 1.0 g VSS/L to 2.7 g VSS/L. It shows that the 
pre-culture seed and the batch strategy could efficiently shorten the lag phase and enhance the biomass 
growth. 
After continuous-feeding mode (HRT 12 h) was activated, the pH was maintained at 6.0 and ORP ranged 
from -300 mV to -550 mV. Low ORP values were generally favorable to biohydrogen generation due 
probably to the accumulation of free electrons in NADH (Wan et al., 2006). Table 1 shows that the 
average sucrose degradation was 87.8±10.9% during unsteady-state operation (days 3-20), but was 
 147 
butyricum as the hydrogen production species, compatible anaerobic hydrogen production species 
Klebcieala pneumonia, and also several non-hydrogen producing species, such as Streptococcus sp. and 
Pseudomonas sp. From day 14, the predominant hydrogen producing bacterium shifted from C. butyricun 
to C. pasteurianum and then changed to C. tyrobutyricum at day 22. The bacteria composition structure 
and changes of HPR and pH values were compared over all start-up period.  
pH value is the main factor affecting the changes of bacterial composition structure and the HPR value in 
hydrogen fermentation. For the operation of days 0-13, the pH value was around 6.0, the bacterial 
composition structure results show random changes in bacterial species, while HPR values were low and 
unstable (0.2-3.8 m3/m3/d) when compared with other periods’ values. The best HPR performance (an 
average value of 4.2 m3/m3/d) was obtained at days 14-20 with the pH values of 5.5-6.0. C. pasteurianum 
became the dominant hydrogen production bacteria, while fewer substrate competitor species were present.  
In addition, the performance of HPR in the later stage (after 22-days operation) was more stable in 
contrast to that for the first 20-days operation, as the HPR was within the range of 2 to 4 m3/m3/d during 
this period. The foregoing results clearly indicate the performance of hydrogen production during the 
whole start-up operation period in the pilot fermenter. The best performance occurred when C. 
pastuerianum was the only predominant hydrogen-producing species. To maintain this preferable bacterial 
community structure, the pH values should be maintained at 5.5-6.0. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This work demonstrated a successful start-up of a 400-L pilot-scale H2 fermentation system feeding on 
substrate sucrose. The effective start-up strategy is using acclimated seed sludge and a two-day batch 
feeding mode followed by a continuous feeding operation. The hydrogen production performance had 
peak HPR and HY values of 5.22 m3/m3/d and 2.34 mol H2/mol sucrose, respectively. Two Clostridium 
species, C. butyricum and C. pasteurianum were observed in the system. Stable hydrogen production rate 
was obtained when C. pasteurianum was the dominant hydrogen-producing bacterial population as the 
fermenter was operated at pH 5.5-6.0.

Abstract Using anaerobic microorganisms to convert organic waste to produce hydrogen gas 
gives the benefits of energy recovery and environmental production. The objective of this study 
was to develop a biohydrogen production technology from food wastewater focusing on 
hydrogen production efficiency and microflora community at different hydraulic retention times. 
Condensed molasses fermentation soluble (CMS) was used as the substrate because it is 
sacchariferous and ideal for hydrogen production. CMS contained nutrient components that are 
necessary for bacterial growth: microbial protein, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, and 
coenzymes. The seed sludge was obtained from waste activated sludge of a municipal sewage 
treatment plant in central Taiwan and this seed sludge was rich in Clostridium sp. 
A CSTR (continuously-stirred tank reactor) lab-scale hydrogen fermenter (working volume, 4.0 
L) was operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3-24 h and an influent CMS 
concentration of 40 g COD/L. The results showed that the peak hydrogen production rate of 390 
mmol H2/L-d, was occurred at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 320 g COD/L-d at a HRT of 3 h. 
The peak hydrogen yield was obtained at an OLR of 80 g COD/L-d at a HRT of 12 h. At HRT 8 
h, all hydrogenase mRNA detected were from Clostridium acetobutylicum-like and Clostridium 
pasteurianum-like hydrogen-producing bacteria by RT-PCR analysis. RNA based analysis of 
hydrogenase gene and 16S rRNA gene suggests that Clostridium existed in the fermentative 
hydrogen-producing system and might be the dominant hydrogen-producing bacteria at tested 
HRTs (except 3 h). The feedstock cost of hydrogen production from CMS is lower than those of 
sucrose and starch, because CMS is a waste and is zero cost and no nutrient addition are 
necessary. Therefore, to produce hydrogen from food wastewater is a more commercial feasible 
bioprocess for further applications.

INTRODUCTION 
Hydrogen is a clean energy resource. Using anaerobic microorganisms to convert organic 
wastewater or waste to produce hydrogen gas gives the benefits of energy recovery and 
environmental protection. Organics like carbohydrates and peptones are readily biodegradable 
materials for hydrogen production (Wu and Lin, 2004). Dark hydrogen fermentation is 
economically feasible because it has higher H2 production rate than other biological hydrogen 
production methods such as photo fermentation.  
A CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) fermentation system is a common mode of 
continuous hydrogen production. This system’s completely mixing operation allows an intimate 
contact between substrate and biomass, as well as effective pH and temperature control. The 
 159 
using a pH controller and 6 M NaOH. The amount of biogas produced was measured using a 
wet-gas meter (Ritter, Germany, TG 1/5). When a steady-state condition reached and the desired 
data were obtained the HRT was reduced. Steady-state conditions reached when the product 
concentrations such as hydrogen gas content and biogas production maintained stable. 
 
Monitoring and analyses 
During the hydrogen-production experiments, the monitoring parameters were pH, ORP 
(oxidation- reduction potential), alkalinity, volatile fatty acid (VFA) distribution and gas 
production. The gas volumes were measured with a wet gas meter (Ritter, Bochum, Germany) at 
a standard temperature (0oC) and pressure (760 mm Hg) (STP). For the chemostat reactor, 
steady-state conditions are considered to be established when product concentrations are stable 
(less than 15% variations). The hydrogen production efficiency was evaluated using the hydrogen 
content in the biogas, hydrogen yield (the ability converting glucose into hydrogen, HY), 
hydrogen production rate (the rate of hydrogen production from the reactor, HPR) and specific 
HPR (the hydrogen production ability of the biomass in the reactor, SHPR). 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1975) were used to determine the above 
parameters of liquid content. Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a 
flame ionization detector (glass column, 145oC; injection temperature, 175oC; carrier gas, N2; 
packing, FON 10%). Gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal 
conductivity detector (column, 55oC; injection temperature, 90oC; carrier gas, Argon; packing, 
Porapak Q, mesh 80/100). Anthrone-sufuric acid method was used to measure hexose 
concentration (Dubois et al., 1956). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Biogas production 
The CSTR fermenter had been started-up successfully using the thermal pretreatment method for 
substrate at HRT 24 h. Fig. 2 illustrates the daily variations of HPR, ORP and hydrogen content at 
various HRTs. Low hydrogen production with hydrogen content 36% was observed at the 
beginning (days 1-2). HPR and hydrogen content increased to 153 mmol H2/L/d and 47%, 
respectively, with HRT decreasing to 12 h (Table 2). The RT-PCR analysis shows that 
Clostridium acetobutylicum-like and C. pasteurianum-like hydrogenase mRNA existed in both 
procedures. Clostridium pasteurianum has high hydrogen production efficiency (Chang et al., 
2008). Hsiao et al. (2005) used C. pasteurianum, C. tyrobutyricum and C. sporosphaeroides to 
produce hydrogen from CMS and the results indicate that the hydrogen production efficiency of 
C. pasteurianum was higher than that of the other two bacteria. Because these two clostridial 
strains are the dominant hydrogen-producing bacteria in the hydrogen fermenters using mixed 
bacteria, the thermal-pretreated system for inhibiting the hydrogen-consumed bacteria can be shut 
down during HRT of 8-3 h. The system could be successfully operated at non 
thermal-pretreatment CMS at HRT because no methane production was detected during HRT 8-3 
h. When the OLR was stepwise increased, HPR increased along with the increasing OLR. The 
peak HPR of 390 mmol H2/L-d at 320 g COD/L-d and a HRT of 3 h was 13-folds high to 30 
 161 
per mol of glucose.

C6H12O6 + 3H2O → CH3CH2OH + CH3COO- + 2H2 + 2HCO3- + 3H+ (4) 
 
A comparison of hydrogen production yield between experimental and theoretical values is 
shown in Table 2. The experimental yield value was much lower than that of theoretical value. An 
explanation is that the microorganisms producing acetate with hydrogen consumption are 
established in the system (Antonopoulou et al., 2008). Another reason is that there were some 
fermentation soluble metabolites such as lactate and formate were not measured.  
 
Comparison of hydrogen production between substrates CMS and molasses 
Molasses contains high concentrations of carbohydrates which is easy to be degraded 
anaerobically. Ren et al. (2006) used molasses as substrate to produce hydrogen. The results 
showed the higher hydrogen production efficiency (HPR and SHPR) was obtained at short HRT 
3-4 h (Table 4) from CMS than molasses. The HPR and SHPR values of CMS were 46% and 
112%, respectively, higher than that those of molasses. The reasons why CMS gave high 
hydrogen production could be (1) CMS contained glutamate which is also a good substrate for 
hydrogen producing bacteria, (2) CMS contained other microorganisms that could convert 
glutamate into hydrogen and (3) proper operation strategies were used. 
Genus Clostridium and Enterobacteria are known for evolving hydrogen during anaerobic 
fermentation by the hydrocarbon contents in CMS, and their existence in fermentative hydrogen 
production processes had been shown by scanning electron micrographs, RNA-based analysis of 
hydrogenase gene and 16S rRNA gene analysis (Chang et al., 2008; Hsiao et al., 2005; Ren et al. 
2006). Different Clostridium species (C. acetobutylicum, C. pasteurianum, C. saccharobutylicum, 
and C. sporosphaeroides) were existed in a fermentative hydrogen-producing system and might 
be the dominant hydrogen-producing bacteria at HRT 12, 8, 6, and 4 h (Table 4). C. 
sporosphaeroides can use monosodium glutamate, which is abundant in CMS, to produce 
hydrogen (Eq 5). Although Clostridium might be the major hydrogen producers and could give 
high hydrogen yield and butyrate concentrations, there were different microbial populations 
dominant at some situations. According to our pervious study, low pH environment is not suitable 
for Clostridium to dominate in fermenters (Hsiao et al., 2005). Fermenter at short HRT also 
indicated that Acidaminococcus was dominant at HRT 3 h and could use glutamate that already 
produced by Corynebacterium sp. to produce hydrogen and (Table 4). Although 
Acidaminococcus sp. produced hydrogen with high hydrogen production rate, its substrate 
conversion ratio was low at HRT 3 h (Chang et al., 2008). These results suggest that 
co-cultivating Clostridium and Acidaminococcus strains might efficiently consume the 
carbohydrates and monosodium glutamate contained in CMS to enhance hydrogen productivity.

studies of biohydrogen production from wastewaters in Taiwan”，內容是本校
生物氫能研發團隊於生質氫能模場的操作技術成果。 
 
二、 心得與建議 
此研討會之前數次名稱是「 International Workshop on Innovative 
Anaerobic Technology（創新厭氧科技國際研討會）」，係於 2003 年由日本東北大
學的 Tatsuya Noike 教授、韓國 KAIST 的 Hang-Sik Shin 教授、香港大學的方漢
平教授及台灣成功大學鄭幸雄教授共同發起。此研討會之主要目的包括：(1)提供
「創新性厭氧消化技術」交流；(2)學術及文化交流；(3)提供年輕研究員之發表研
究成國籍練習英文的機會。此研討會第一屆於 2003 年在韓國 KAIST 舉辦，相繼
於 2004 年日本東北大學、2005 年台灣逢甲大學、2006 年韓國 KAIST 以及 2008
年日本大學舉辦。 
本次研討會共有 100 餘人參加，分別來自荷蘭、美國、新加坡、泰國、中國、
日本、台灣、韓國與香港等 9 國家，人數算是歷年來最多之一次。這也是因為主
辦的方漢平教授國際知名，尤其在中國大陸更是多所高校之客座教授，算是桃李
滿天下。方漢平教授也是逢甲大學的特約講座教授。藉著此次的國際學者總動員，
大家也共同撰寫厭氧技術之專書，目前已經交稿整合編輯中。 
由發表內容觀之，厭氧技術包含傳統的產甲烷，也包含目前很熱門的產氫，
而且逐漸往包含液態產物之有機酸與醇類，尤其是更具熱能效益之丁醇。此外，
除生質氣體之產生外，後續之利用亦為大家重視；換句話說，大家已經朝向整體
程序研發，也有各種模場規模之研究。因此，厭氧技術在生質能源上之應用，顯
然是不可或缺技術之一。這對國際邁向既能節能減碳，也能減少環保處理成本之
「氫能社會」，是一大鼓勵。

2.與會心得 
這是我第一次參加國際型的研討會，藉由此次國際研討會，可以得知世界各地相關之
研究，並進行學術交流；藉此改進個人研究之方向及方法。在這兩天的議程規劃主要
涵蓋生質能源開發的近況、各國對於能源議題之因應政策及相關能源再生系統整合。
此次研討會所發表之研究內容包含厭氧醱酵菌（產生氫氣、酒精、丁醇、甲烷等）的
篩選、廢水處理及利用分生技術進行厭氧醱酵之能源整合系統。此次出國回來看到了
跟台灣不一樣的差異；雖然同為華人社會，但是在生活、文化上都有許多差異。對於
各國在生質能源領域的研究，都各有其優勢存在，因而開始思考我們的優勢是什麼？
我們需要去加強的地方在哪？整體而言，研究是可以相互支援，且發展是非常快速的，
畢竟個人力量是有限的，藉由截長補短增進自己的實力是一條非常快速的方法。研究
者之間應多多交流，閉門造車已不適合現代工業發展，若能將彼此之間的交流提升至
國際性的，則更有機會可以學習到新穎創新的尖端技術。

by sewage sludge microflora

Abstract 
There is annual 6.5×106 metric tons of agricultural wastes in Taiwan and 30% of those are rice straw waste. The 
anaerobic degradation of organics produces volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ethanol, hydrogen gas and methane. Disposal 
of the rice straw waste results in environmental pollution problems and squanders natural biomass resources. 
Hydrogen is a promising candidate as an ideal and clean source of energy in the future. It was demonstrated that the 
addition of surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (commercially also known as Tween 80), 
significantly increased the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses (Eriksson et al., 2002; Goto et al., 2003). 
Increased hydrolysis by the addition of surfactant was reported for delignified various plants, such as wood, orchard 
grass and corn stover (Helle et al., 1993; Goto et al., 2003; Kaar and Holtzapple, 1998). Surfactants have positive 
interactions with the microbial growth, intermediate production and dry matter degradability in rumen in vivo (Goto 
et al., 2003). However, some literature investigated the effect of surfactant Tween 80 on the conversion of rice straw 
wastes into biohydrogen by waste sludge microflora. Thus, based on these considerations, this research was aimed at 
investigating the conversion effect of rice straw wastes into biohydrogen by the addition of surfactant Tween 80. 
The experimental results indicated that the cumulative hydrogen production amounts were 9.6, 5.4, 3.4, 6.8, 
9.0, 3.9 and 0.004 ml for the concentration of Tween 80 were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 ml/l, respectively. There is no 
increasing effect of hydrogen gas production after the addition of surfactant Tween 80. However, the initial time of 
producing hydrogen gas on the blank test was about 20 hours, and the test that added Tween 80 could shorten the 
initial time of producing hydrogen gas to 8 hours. These results demonstrate the similar effect of catalytic agent on 
the addition of surfactant Tween 80 on the conversion of rice straw wastes into biohydrogen. It could accelerate the 
reaction time but no effect on increasing the amount of cumulative hydrogen production. 
The VFAs on the blank test were acetate (HAc, 841 mg COD/L), propionate (HPr, 248 mg COD/L), 
iso-butyrate (i-HBu, 386 mg COD/L) and butyrate (HBu, 74 mg COD/L) and ethanol (EtOH, 198 mg COD/L). This 
result showed HAc was the dominant liquid product. Many works also reveal that the main products are acetate and 
butyrate in the fermentation of carbohydrate by Clostridium species and most are of butyrate-pathway (Lin et al., 
2006). The blank test results reveal that hydrogen production from rice straw was acetate-pathway. However, when 
the surfactant Tween 80 was added, the concentration of HAc were decreased to 89-168 mg COD/L but the 
concentration of ethanol were increased to 364-1210 mg COD/L. The increments of ethanol production as compared 
with the blank test were 184-611 %. The pathway of hydrogen production from rice straw shifted to ethanol-pathway 
that decreased the hydrogen gas production but increased the ethanol production. The effect of increasing ethanol 
production on other microorganism that preferred to produce ethanol need to research further. 
 
Key words: anaerobic fermentation, hydrogen production, rice straw, surfactant, Tween 80.

grass and corn stover (Helle et al., 1993; Goto et al., 2003; Kaar and Holtzapple, 1998). Surfactants have positive 
interactions with the microbial growth, intermediate production and dry matter degradability in rumen in vivo (Goto 
et al., 2003). However, some literature investigated the effect of surfactant Tween 80 on the conversion of rice straw 
wastes into biohydrogen by waste sludge microflora. Thus, based on these considerations, this research was aimed at 
investigating the conversion effect of rice straw wastes into biohydrogen by the addition of surfactant Tween 80. 
The experimental results indicated that the cumulative hydrogen production amounts were 9.6, 5.4, 3.4, 6.8, 
9.0, 3.9 and 0.004 ml for the concentration of Tween 80 were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 ml/l, respectively. There is no 
increasing effect of hydrogen gas production after the addition of surfactant Tween 80. However, the initial time of 
producing hydrogen gas on the blank test was about 20 hours, and the test that added Tween 80 could shorten the 
initial time of producing hydrogen gas to 8 hours. These results demonstrate the similar effect of catalytic agent on 
the addition of surfactant Tween 80 on the conversion of rice straw wastes into biohydrogen. It could accelerate the 
reaction time but no effect on increasing the amount of cumulative hydrogen production. 
The VFAs on the blank test were acetate (HAc, 841 mg COD/L), propionate (HPr, 248 mg COD/L), 
iso-butyrate (i-HBu, 386 mg COD/L) and butyrate (HBu, 74 mg COD/L) and ethanol (EtOH, 198 mg COD/L). This 
result showed HAc was the dominant liquid product. Many works also reveal that the main products are acetate and 
butyrate in the fermentation of carbohydrate by Clostridium species and most are of butyrate-pathway (Lin et al., 
2006). The blank test results reveal that hydrogen production from rice straw was acetate-pathway. However, when 
the surfactant Tween 80 was added, the concentration of HAc were decreased to 89-168 mg COD/L but the 
concentration of ethanol were increased to 364-1210 mg COD/L. The increments of ethanol production as compared 
with the blank test were 184-611 %. The pathway of hydrogen production from rice straw shifted to ethanol-pathway 
that decreased the hydrogen gas production but increased the ethanol production. The effect of increasing ethanol 
production on other microorganism that preferred to produce ethanol need to research further. 
 
Key words: anaerobic fermentation, hydrogen production, rice straw, surfactant, Tween 80.

Abstract 
Dark fermentation is the most potential technology for H2 production due to its high 
production rate, technical simplicity, and few energy requirements. To investigate the core 
technology for hydrogen fermentation, synthetic wastewaters, such as glucose, xylose and 
sucrose were well used as the feedstocks. However, to enhance the commercial viability of bioH2, 
a low-cost and easy-conversion feedstock should be used. Among the possible candidates, starch, 
cellulose and actual wastewaters are considered as the cost-effective feedstocks for the 
commercialization of biohydrogen production. Environmental parameters affect the cellulosic 
hydrolysis enzyme activity and the metabolic pathways in anaerobic fermentation production 
processes. However, literatures (Lin and Fang, 2007; Hawks et al., 2007) indicate that various 
optimal operation conditions for this process have been carried out. In the present study, therefore, 
the effects of substrate concentration (15 and 30 g COD/L), temperature (30 and 55oC), pH (6 and 
8), nutrient (Endo et al., 1982) addition and optimal operation condition on hydrogen production 
from oil extracted biomass residue using sewage sludge seed were investigate by batch tests. The 
experimental result indicate that the peak hydrogen production yield of 2.11 mL/g-residue was 
obtained at pH 8, temperature 55oC and without nutrient addition. The main effect analysis result 
indicates that the effective levels were temperature > nutrient addition > substrate concentration > 
pH. These results indicate that the oil extracted biomass residue contains nutrients necessary for 
hydrogen-producing bacteria in anaerobic fermentation.

It is well know that carbohydrates are the main source of hydrogen during 
fermentation processes and therefore waste/wastewater or agricultural residues rich in 
carbohydrates can be considered as potential sources of hydrogen [1]. Mixed anaerobic 
microfloras obtained from sewage sludge are well used for fermentative hydrogen 
production [2]. Preserved fruits are a kind of Chinese traditional snacks. A large amount 
of sugar is used in the manufacturing process but the soaking solution that contained 
high sugar concentration is almost discarded. Sugar is a good material for fermentative 
hydrogen. The waste soaking solution, therefore, was used to produce hydrogen gas in 
this study.  
    The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the environmental 
factors of initial cultivation pH and substrate concentration on clostridia-rich natural 
anaerobe germination for hydrogen production. In this study, a full-factorial 
central-composite experimental design [3] was employed in planning the experiments 
for learning the effects of pH and substrate concentration on the hydrogen production in 
a batch fermentor feeding preserved fruits soaking solution. For determining which 
experimental variable settings will affect hydrogen production, the response-surface 
methodology [3] was employed to determine and explain the conditions required for 
efficient hydrogen production. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Seed sludge and Substrate 
Anaerobic wastewater sludge obtained from a paper mill factory was used as the 
seed sludge. The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express the biomass 
concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the seed sludge were 7.5, 35.2 g/l and 
65.1 g/l, respectively. Heating at 100◦C for 45 min was used to treat the collected sludge 
to inhibit methane-producing bacteria activity. The soaking solution is from a preserved 
fruits manufactory in central Taiwan. The pH, sugar and chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) of the soaking solution were 4.0, 620 g/L and 500 g COD/L. 
2.2. Experimental design and procedure 
Hydrogen-production experiments were performed in serum vials with a working 
volume of 125 ml, using a batch test. The vials were initially gassed with argon gas 
followed by seed microflora (30 ml) and substrate (25 ml) addition. The vials were 
placed in a reciprocal air-bath shaker (150 rpm) with the temperature controlled at 35 ± 
1◦C. The tested pH values were 4–8 in an interval of 1 units. The substrate 
concentrations were conducted at 1.24-6.20 g COD/L. The total gas and total volatile 
 9 
may directly affect the hydrogen-producing activity [7]. According to the response 
surface analysis, the peak hydrogen production yield and H2 concentration were 
obtained at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1). This indicates that the maximum hydrogen generation 
efficiency from preserved fruits soaking solution occurred at the pH range of 5.5~6.5, 
similar to the hydrogen fermentation from glucose [6] and sugar-rich wastewater (Table 
3). Kawano et al.[8] also reported that when the initial pH of cultures were adjusted to 
6.5 and 7.0 (uncontrolled), the pH value further decreased to a suitable pH condition 
(around 6) for hydrogen fermentation. 
3.2. Productions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol 
The formation of hydrogen is accompanied with VFA or solvent production during 
an anaerobic fermentation process. The production of these liquid products reflects the 
metabolism of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Therefore, the VFA and solvent 
concentration distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring 
hydrogen production [11]. 
The concentrations of the main metabolic products measured at 68 h are 
summarized in Table 1. The dominant VFAs were acetic (HAc, 377~1988 mg COD/L), 
propionate (HPr, 5~350 mg COD/L) and butyric acids (HBu, 153~1412 mg COD/L). To 
understand the relationship between the productions of hydrogen and TVFA, the TVFA 
and EtOH-producing contour lines against pH and substrate concentrations were plotted 
using the response surface analysis (Fig. 2). Many works also reveal that sewage sludge 
is a good seed microflora source for cultivating hydrogen-producing bacteria for 
efficient hydrogen fermentation using carbohydrate. Clostridium species were found to 
be the dominant microorganisms in incubated sewage sludge. Similar observations were 
found that the main products are acetate and butyrate in the fermentation of 
carbohydrate by Clostridium species [11]. 
The maximum TVFA concentrations were obtained at high substrate concentration 
and low pH (without nutrients) but obtained at a soaking solution concentration of 6.0 g 
COD/L and pH 6.5 (nutrients addition) (Fig. 2). Ethanol is another important liquid 
fermentation product being used as an energy resource. High ethanol concentration was 
obtained at high values of preserved soaking solution concentration and pH. Lin et al. 
[11] reported that the main fermentation product was ethanol at pH 8. Moreover, pH and 
substrate concentration could affect the metabolic pathway during hydrogen production. 
On the other hand, nutrient concentration also influences the concentration of 
metabolites. The strategies such as properly controlling nutrient [12], 
carbon/nitrogen-ratio [13], carbonate and phosphate concentration [14] could be used to 
promote the hydrogen production in dark fermentation.

Abstract 
This study aimed at investigating the effects of seed thermal enrichment and initial cultivation 
pH on fermentative hydrogen production from rice straw by a batch test using vial serum 
bioreactors. The cumulative hydrogen production amounts were 16, 2, 3 and 2 ml for the raw 
sludges W1, W2, C and T1, respectively; methane amounts were 0, 32, 27 and 36 ml, respectively. 
However, thermal-enriched sludge W1, W2, C and T1 had higher hydrogen production with the 
amounts of 13, 16, 4 and 9 ml, respectively; no methane was detected. The liquid products for 
municipal sewage W1 contained acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and ethanol; their 
concentration distribution fractions were 70.9, 6.8, 17.4, 2.4 and 2.4 %, respectively. In the pH 
experiments, there was no gas detected for the initial pH values of 3.5 to 5.5. But the hydrogen 
gas amounts were 2.5, 13.4, 10.1, 0.6 and 0.7 ml for the initial cultivation pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 
7.0, 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. The experimental results indicated that hydrogen production from 
rice straw by sewage sludge microflora was of acetate-fermentation type. Sludge W1 contained 
special species that can directly degrade rice straw and produce hydrogen. Hydrogen production 
from rice straw by mixed anaerobic microflora was initial cultivation pH-dependent; 
heat-treatment on seed sludge could enhance hydrogen production. The optimal pH values for 
Sludge W1 to produce hydrogen were around 6.0-7.0 with peak HY of 7.4 ml/g. The thermal 
treatment of Sludge W1 enhanced liquid product production by 114-391%.

1. Introduction 
There is 6.5×106 metric tons of agricultural wastes every year in Taiwan and 30% of them is 
rice straw waste. The anaerobic degradation of organics produces volatile fatty acids (VFAs), 
ethanol, hydrogen gas and methane. Disposal of the rice straw waste results in environmental 
pollution problems and squanders natural biomass resources. Hydrogen is a promising candidate 
as an ideal and clean source of energy in the future. It is known that Clostridium species are 
important anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms (Kataoka et al., 1997; Reimann et al., 
1996). Clostridia are spore-forming bacteria and resistant to heat environment (Brock et al.,

(Lin and Chang, 1999; Chen et al., 2002). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Hydrogen gas production 
Table 1 summarizes the thermal enrichment experimental results (Experiment I) of various 
seed sludges digesting rice straw. For the non thermal treated sludges, the cumulative hydrogen 
production amounts were 16, 2, 3 and 2 ml for W1, W2, C and T1, respectively with methane gas 
amounts of 0, 32, 27 and 36 ml, respectively. However, the thermal-enriched sludges W2, C and 
T1 had higher hydrogen production with 16, 4 and 9 ml, respectively; no methane was detected. 
This reveals that heat treatment on most sludges could enhance hydrogen production from rice 
straw except that of sludge W1. The efficiency of thermal enrichment on enhancing the hydrogen 
production was common in digesting carbohydrate (Lin et al., 2002). Heat-treatment can enrich 
the anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms tolerating high temperature but inhibit other 
bacteria not able to adapt to high temperature. Literature shows that the thermal enrichment can 
enhance most anaerobic sludges to increase hydrogen production (Li and Fang, 2007). Microbial 
analysis indicates that these microorganisms were spore-forming bacteria. Table 1 reveals that 
non-thermal treated sludge (W1) had high hydrogen production showing it contained a special 
microbial species directly degrading the rice straw. Further study on this seed sludge was 
conducted to elucidate its bioactivity.  
Table 2 summarizes the experimental results of initial cultivation pH effects (Experiment II) 
of sludge W1. There was no gas detected for the initial pH values of 3.5 to 5.5. The hydrogen gas 
amounts were 2.5, 13.4, 10.1, 0.6 and 0.7 ml for the initial cultivation pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 
7.5 and 8.0, respectively. In the hydrogen produced pH ranges the ORP values were in the ranges 
favoring hydrogen production. This result reveals that initial cultivation pH affected hydrogen 
production from rice straw and the optimal values were around pH 6.0-7.0. Proper control of 
initial cultivation pH could affect the fermentation pathway and enhance hydrogen production.  
 
3.2. Productions of volatile fatty acids and ethanol 
The formation of hydrogen is accompanied with VFA or solvent production during an 
anaerobic fermentation process. The production of these liquid products reflects the metabolism 
of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Therefore, the VFA and solvent concentration 
distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring hydrogen production (Lin et 
al., 2006).

Abstract 
This work aimed at studying the potential for biohydrogen production from agricultural 
wastes using anaerobic mixed microflora. The agricultural wastes used were coffee 
waste, guava waste, mango waste, Litchi waste (W4), and papaya waste. The seed 
sludge was obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant. The collected wastewater 
sludge was heat-treated by 100◦C for 45 min. This experiment was cultured at initial pH 
of 6.7, substrate concentrations of 7 g TCOD/L and temperature of 35oC. The mixed 
microflora could produce hydrogen from these wastes; peak hydrogen yield and 
hydrogen production rate were Mango waste  1.06 mmol H2/g COD substrate and 0.51 
mmol H2/L/d, respectively.

Experimental design and procedure 
Batch hydrogen production experiments were performed in serum bottles (a volume of 
125 ml) with anaerobic head space. Argon gassed serum vial was added with 
sludge-inoculum of 5 ml and an  agricultural waste solution of 40 ml and pH adjusting 
solution (1 N HCl or 1N NaOH) of 5 ml. The vials were placed in a reciprocal air-bath 
shaker (150 rpm) with a cultivation temperature of 35 ± 1◦C.  
To obtain the hydrogen production feasibility of these wastes, they were prepared 
individually at 10 g COD/L. Hydrogen fermentation was conducted at an initial pH of 
6.7, substrate concentrations of 7 g TCOD/L and temperature of 35oC. The volume and 
composition of digestion gas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentrations were 
determined after 120 h cultivation. The nutrient supplements were (mg/l): NH4HCO3 
5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, FeSO4•7H2O 25, 
CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125, and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1982). Each 
experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine 
pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and VSS concentration of liquid content. 
Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization 
detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a gas tight 
syringe and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal 
conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the 
VFA, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in our previous studies 
(Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et al., 2006). Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to 
measure carbohydrate (Dubois et al., 1956). 
 
 
 
 27
The modified Gompertz equation was used to describe the progress of cumulative 
hydrogen production (Lay et al., 1999).  The cumulative hydrogen production data 
obtained from these batch experiments was used to fit the modified Gompertz equation. 
The correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.87 to 0.912. The λ values were low 
showing microorganisms do not need adaptation time to the agricultural wastes.  
Table 3 shows the relationships between hydrogen yield (the ability to convert sucrose 
into hydrogen, mol-H2/mol-sucrose, HY), HPRmax (the hydrogen gas production rate, 
mmole-H2/L/d
 , HPRmax) and agricultural wastes. The peaked hydrogen yield for Mango 
waste was 1.06 mmol H2/g COD substrate, which is higher than reports (0.83 mmol 
H2/g COD substrate, Cai et al., 2004; 0.6 mmol H2/g COD substrate, Wang et al., 2003). 
Although other reported values (1.7 mmol H2/gpeptone, Lianget al.,  2003; 1.96 mmol 
H2/g hexose, Lay et al., 2001) are higher than the hydrogen production yields of  these 
wastes, agricultural waste have the potential for fermentative hydrogen production.

CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results. The mixed 
microflora could produce hydrogen from agricultural wastes of coffee waste, guava 
waste, mange waste, Litchi waste, and papaya waste. The peak hydrogen yield and 
hydrogen production rate were Mango waste with values of 1.06 mmol H2/g COD

Chang, 1999). Determining the hydrogen production potential of agricultural wastes 
enhances the efficient usage of these wastes. 
Previous studies have shown that the anaerobic bacteria obtained from sewage sludge 
could convert synthetic and sugar-rich wastewaters into biohydrogen (Lin and Chang, 
1999; Lin and Lay, 2005; Lo et al., 2006). pH and substrate concentration are the key 
process parameters affecting hydrogen production because they directly affect 
hydrogen-producing activity (Lin et al., 2006; Lay et al., 2007). Yu et al. (2006) 
suggests that concentration of carbon substrates (or organic loading) in wastewater had 
a slightly negative effect on the hydrogen yield (HY). However, the specific hydrogen 
production rate (HPR) substantially increased with increasing substrate concentration. 
In some cases, high substrate concentration might be unfavourable for hydrogen 
production due to substrate inhibition. On the other hand, since pH affects the growth 
rate of microorganisms, pH changes might cause drastic shifts in the relative population 
numbers of different species in the heterogeneous hydrogen-producing reactors 
(Horiuchi et al., 1999). A pH range is reported optimal for fermentation of 
carbohydrates by mixed bacterial cultures (Li and Fang, 2007). It is important to obtain 
the optimal cultivation substrate concentration and pH for hydrogen production using 
mixed microflora. 
In our present work, several sludges rich in hydrogen producers were used because they 
could convert xylose and sucrose into hydrogen effectively (Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et 
al., 2006). This study was aimed to investigate the the effects of the environmental 
factors of initial cultivation pH and substrate concentration on the H2 production from 
agricultural wastes by heat-treated sewage sludge inoculums. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Hydrogen-producing sludge and fermentation medium 
The seed sludge was obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant located in 
central Taiwan. The collected wastewater sludge was heat-treated by 100◦C for 45 min 
to inhibit the methanogenic activity and select H2-producing spore-forming bacteria 
(Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et al., 2006; Li and Fang, 2007). The pH, volatile suspended 
solids (VSS, to express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of 
the seed sludge were 7.5, 35.2 g/l and 65.1 g/l, respectively. The synthetic agricultural 
wastes were bananas and oranges from a supermarket in Taichung, Taiwan. The peel 
and fresh were minced individually by a juicer as pulps and then used in this study. For 
measured the TCOD (total chemical oxygen demands) concentration and VSS, each 
agricultural waste of 150 g was added into a volumetric flask and then filled deionized 
 33
HPR data obtained from the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. 1) (Lin and Lay, 2004a;

RESULTS 
 
Hydrogen production from agricultural wastes 
Anaerobic hydrogen production bacteria cultured at substrate concentration 35.00 g 
COD/L and initial pH 7.0 for biohydrogen production from the agricultural wastes. 
Table 2 illustrates that the cumulative hydrogen productions were from 63 to 135 ml and 
the hydrogen contents were from 22 to 40 % without methane. There was considerable 
variation in both the TCOD and carbohydrate concentrations of the agricultural wastes 
with 28-77 and 37 - 91 %, respectively. The final pHs were 4.4 - 6.4 after 104 h 
cultivation. 
The modified Gompertz equation was fitted into hydrogen production curves to estimate 
the biogas production rate and the lag-phase time. The highest maximum hydrogen 
production rates (HPRm, 133 and 139 mmol H2/L/d) and specific maximum hydrogen 
production rates (SHPRm, 23 and 24 mmol H2/g VSS/d) were obtained from BF and 
BF+OF wastes, respectively (Table 3). The highest hydrogen production yield of more 
than 2 mmol H2/g COD substrate peaked in all the fresh wastes (BF, OF, and BF+OF). 
The average lag-phase time prior to exponential H2 production was 9.3 h with the 
exception for the blank. In this experiment, the highest hydrogen productivity peaked 
with BP. Therefore, BP was used as the substrate to investigate the effects of pHs and 
substrate concentrations on biohydrogen production. 
 
Hydrogen production at different pH and substrate concentrations  
The profiles of cumulative H2 production from BF at an initial pH of 4.5-10.0 with a 
substrate concentration of 50.00 g COD/L are illustrated in Fig 1, which clearly shows 
that H2 production at initial pH 7.0 was much more effective than those at others. Table 
4 showed that the hydrogen gas content in the product gas was higher than 30 % with no 
 35
The ethanol distribution of SMP for all the BF concentrations (6.25-56.25 g COD/L) 
was very high (34-57 %), followed by butyrate (i-HBu + n-HBu) of 14-52 % (Fig 3). 
The production of acetate and propionate was also significant with 1.45-2.09 and 
0.05-6.0 g COD/L at various BF concentrations, respectively (Fig 3). These results 
indicated that high BF concentrations favored butyrate-type fermentation during 
hydrogen conversion. Similar results have been reported (Tao et al., 2007). 
 
DISCUSSION 
The degree of pH reduction depended on many factors such as substrate and sludge 
concentrations, temperature, duration, and so on. Many studies reported the optimal 
initial pH values for hydrogen activity at neutral pH range of 6.5-8.0 (Lin and Lay, 2005; 
Lay et al., 2007; Lin and Lay, 2004a; Lin and Lay, 2004b). Lin et al. (2006) reported 
that the optimal initial pH of cultures for hydrogen production was 6.5 with peak values 
of HY 1.3 mol H2/mol xylose and HPRm 0.25 mol H2/L/day. Kawano et al. also showed 
that the optimal initial cultivation pH was 6.5 and 7.0 for hydrogen production (Kawano 
et al., 2004). 
Sewage sludge is a good source of H2-producers for the fermentation of carbohydrates. 
Clostridia sp. were the dominant H2-producers in mixed cultures enriched from sewage 
sludge and their metabolic pathway from organic materials were shown in Fig 4. 
Butyrate and acetate were the two main products, while low pH seemed to favor 
butyrate production. Propionate production increased substantially at pH 7.0 and above 
(Antonopoulou et al., 2007). We obtained similar results in this study. 
Organic acids are produced during the dark fermentation of carbohydrate and they could 
be converted into hydrogen and CO2 by photo-fermentative bacteria. Higher hydrogen 
production yields could be obtained when two systems are combined (Yokoi et al., 1998; 
Yokoi et al., 2002). Combining dark and photo-fermentation processes seems to be the 
most attractive approach that could result in high hydrogen yields for carbohydrate-rich 
wastes. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results. The mixed 
microflora could produce hydrogen from the agricultural wastes of banana and orange. 
The highest HPRm (317 mmol H2/L/d), SHPRm (56 mmol H2/g VSS/d), and HY (3.7 
mmol H2/g COD substrate) peaked at initial pH of 7.0 and banana fresh of 50 g COD/L. 
The ethanol and butyrate were the major SMP in biohydrogen fermentation of banana 
fresh.

Abstract 
Hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier of the future. Dark fermentation is 
considered the most commercially feasible biological mean of producing H2 due to its 
high H2 production rate. The biohydrogen research team in Feng Chia University, 
Taiwan has successfully developed an effective screening method for indigenous 
hydrogen-producing bacterial strains as well as a high-rate hydrogen producing process 
of agitated granular sludge bed reactor system. This world-record high-rate system is to 
be commercialized. Therefore, a 300 L pilot plant of this system has been constructed 
for developing the scale-up operation parameters. The present work introduces the pilot 
plant technology.  
 
Key words: Bioreactor design, dark fermentation, biohydrogen energy, pilot 
plant technology 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The utilization of fossil fuels causes global climate change, environmental pollution, 
and health problems (Hallenbeck and Benemann 2002) mainly due to increasing 
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This 
has been strictly prohibited globally according to “Kyoto protocol” effective on 
February 16, 2005.  Many research and development approaches have been 
implemented to reduce CO2 emissions. Among them, photosynthetic process enabling 
CO2 fixation by microalgae is the most effective, natural and energy-saving way of 
reducing CO2 in the environment. Hydrogen is considered as an ideal energy carrier of 
 45
lowering the hydrogen production rate.  In this 300 L pilot plant, we use agitated 
granular sludge bed reactor system to enhance cell retention and enable formation of 
self-flocculated granular cells/sludge. 
The pilot plant layout was divided into five section areas including preparation tank, 
mixing system, fermentor, gas/liquid separator and automatic control system (Figures 1 
and 2).

Abstract 
This work aimed at studying the potential for biohydrogen production from agricultural 
wastes using anaerobic mixed microflora. The agricultural wastes used were coffee 
waste, guava waste, mango waste, Litchi waste (W4), and papaya waste. The seed 
sludge was obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant. The collected wastewater 
sludge was heat-treated by 100◦C for 45 min. This experiment was cultured at initial pH 
of 6.7, substrate concentrations of 7 g TCOD/L and temperature of 35oC. The mixed 
microflora could produce hydrogen from these wastes; peak hydrogen yield and 
hydrogen production rate were Mango waste  1.06 mmol H2/g COD substrate and 0.51 
mmol H2/L/d, respectively.  
 
Keywords: Agricultural waste; Biohydrogen production; mixed culture. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Kyoto Protocol was held in 1998 to promote the use of renewable energy sources, 
including biomass, geothermal, solar and wind. The target is to reduce the carbon 
dioxide emissions to 2000 levels by 2020. The renewable energy development plan of 
Taiwan aims to replace 10 percent of the total energy supply with renewable energy 
sources by 2010. The plan includes a number of incentives, such as government funding 
for up to 50 percent of installation fees for wind or solar energy systems. Some 
alternative energy sources are already up and running just like wind plant. The first

Experimental design and procedure 
Batch hydrogen production experiments were performed in serum bottles (a volume of 
125 ml) with anaerobic head space. Argon gassed serum vial was added with 
sludge-inoculum of 5 ml and an  agricultural waste solution of 40 ml and pH adjusting 
solution (1 N HCl or 1N NaOH) of 5 ml. The vials were placed in a reciprocal air-bath 
shaker (150 rpm) with a cultivation temperature of 35 ± 1◦C.  
To obtain the hydrogen production feasibility of these wastes, they were prepared 
individually at 10 g COD/L. Hydrogen fermentation was conducted at an initial pH of 
6.7, substrate concentrations of 7 g TCOD/L and temperature of 35oC. The volume and 
composition of digestion gas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentrations were 
determined after 120 h cultivation. The nutrient supplements were (mg/l): NH4HCO3 
5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, FeSO4•7H2O 25, 
CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125, and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1982). Each 
experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine 
pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and VSS concentration of liquid content. 
Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization 
detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a gas tight 
syringe and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal 
conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the 
VFA, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in our previous studies 
(Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et al., 2006). Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to 
measure carbohydrate (Dubois et al., 1956). 
 
 
 
RESULTS 
The accumulative hydrogen production of Mango waste was 3 times greater than that of 
Papaya waste. Figure 1 shows that hydrogen was produced in 20 h, which means that 
agricultural waste is very suitable for fermentative hydrogen production. The initial pH 
was controlled at 6.7. After fermentation the final pH decreased to 5.92-6.34. The 
hydrogen concentration of the batch test reached 10.7-12.0 %, but coffee waste only 4 
%.  The hexose degradation was 61-94 % for these wastes. This is only a preliminary 
test and in-depth research is necessary. 
 57
waste was 1.06 mmol H2/g COD substrate, which is higher than reports (0.83 mmol 
H2/g COD substrate, Cai et al., 2004; 0.6 mmol H2/g COD substrate, Wang et al., 2003). 
Although other reported values (1.7 mmol H2/gpeptone, Lianget al.,  2003; 1.96 mmol 
H2/g hexose, Lay et al., 2001) are higher than the hydrogen production yields of  these 
wastes, agricultural waste have the potential for fermentative hydrogen production.

CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results. The mixed 
microflora could produce hydrogen from agricultural wastes of coffee waste, guava 
waste, mange waste, Litchi waste, and papaya waste. The peak hydrogen yield and 
hydrogen production rate were Mango waste with values of 1.06 mmol H2/g COD 
substrate and 0.51 mmol H2/L/d, respectively. Agricultural waste have the potential for 
fermentative hydrogen production.

Abstract 
This study was aimed to investigate the effects of initial cultivation pH (4.5-10) and 
substrate concentration (6.24-56.25 g COD/L) on the H2 production from agricultural 
wastes by heat-treated sewage sludge inoculums. Four synthetic agricultural wastes 
were used as the substrates: banana fresh, banana peel, orange fresh and orange peel. 
The hydrogen fermentation was in batch at 35oC. The experimental results showed 
that the mixed microflora could produce hydrogen from the banana and orange wastes. 
The highest maximum hydrogen production rate 244 mmol H2/L/d, maximum specific 
hydrogen production rate 43 mmol H2/g VSS/d, and hydrogen yield 3.2 mmol H2/g 
COD substrate peaked at an initial pH of 7.0 and banana fresh of 50 g COD/L. Ethanol 
and butyrate were the major metabolites in biohydrogen fermentation from the 
agricultural wastes.

INTRODUCTION 
Carbohydrates are good feedstock sources for fermentative hydrogen production. Solid 
wastes, wastewaters or agricultural residues rich in carbohydrates could serve as cheap 
and abundant feedstocks for fermentative hydrogen production (Kapdan and Kargi, 
2006). There are more than 5 million tones of agricultural waste produced annually in 
Taiwan. Utilization of the agricultural waste could efficiently reduce the waste 
disposal/treatment problems. Sewage sludge containing variety of microflora is a 
potential source for obtaining dark fermentative H2-producing microorganisms (Lin and 
 61
water until 1 L (0.15 w/v). The TCOD concentrations, VSS, and moisture contents of 
the four synthetic agricultural wastes ranged from 21.5-48.5 g COD/L, 7.4-20.5 g/L, 
and 75-90 %, respectively (Table 1).   
 
Experimental design and procedure 
Batch hydrogen production experiments were performed in serum bottles (a volume of 
125 ml) with anaerobic head space. Argon gassed serum vial was added with 
sludge-inoculum of 30 ml and an  agricultural waste solution of 25 ml and pH 
adjusting solution (1 N HCl or 1N NaOH) of 5 ml. The vials were placed in a reciprocal 
air-bath shaker (150 rpm) with a cultivation temperature of 35 ± 1◦C.  
Three series of batch experiments were conducted. In the early stages of this study, 
banana fresh (BF), banana peel (BP), orange fresh (OF), and orange peel (OP) 
feedstocks were prepared at 40 g COD/L. The tested pH values were 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 
6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0; substrate concentrations were from 6.25 to 56.25 g COD/L 
from the highest hydrogen productivity of the waste obtained at the first stage 
experiment. The volume and composition of digestion gas and volatile fatty acids 
(VFAs) concentrations were determined after 104~107 h cultivation. 
The nutrient solution contained the following inorganic supplements (mg/l): NH4HCO3 
5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, FeSO4•7H2O 25, 
CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125, and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1982). Each 
experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine 
pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and VSS concentration of liquid content. 
Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization 
detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by a gas tight 
syringe and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal 
conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the 
VFA, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in our previous studies 
(Lin and Lay, 2004; Lin et al., 2006). Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to 
measure carbohydrate (Dubois et al., 1956). 
 
Data analysis 
The hydrogen activity was evaluated using the hydrogen productivity and HPR. These 
two values were determined based on the hydrogen production potential and maximum 
 63
methane and the carbohydrate degradations were from 37 to 91 %. Based on the 
modified Gompertz equation parameters, the lag-phase time was less than 20 h with the 
exception of pH 10.0 (Table 5). The highest HPRm (244 mmol H2/L/d) and SHPRm (43 
mmol H2/g VSS/d) peaked at initial pH 7.0 as well as HY (3.2 mmol H2/g COD 
substrate). This HPRm result was higher than that (220 mmol H2/L/d) of hydrogen 
fermentation from glucose with initial pH 6.2(Salerno et al., 2006). 
Using the optimal initial 7.0 for hydrogen production, the hydrogen production 
performance of cultures with various substrate concentrations of 6.25–56.25 g COD/L 
was investigated. The results clearly indicate that a BF concentration of 50.00 g COD/L 
exhibited the best performance in hydrogen production for the most of categories 
compared in Table 7, especially for the HPRm and SHPRm values. Table 6 and 7 indicate 
that the H2 productivity (H2 evolution, HPRm and SHPRm) increased as the BF 
concentration increased from 6.25 to 50.00 g COD/L, while they decreased slightly 
when the substrate concentration was 30 g COD/L. Fig 2 and Table 7 showed that the 
lag-phase time was less than 20 h. The hydrogen content in the biogas was higher than 
35 % with the exception of BF waste at 6.25 and 12.50 g COD/L (Table 6).   
 
Productions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol at different pH and 
substrate concentrations 
The formation of hydrogen is accompanied with VFA or solvent production during an 
anaerobic fermentation process. The production of liquid products reflects the 
metabolism of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Therefore, the VFAs and solvent 
concentration distributions and their fractions are useful indicators for monitoring 
hydrogen production (Chen et al, 2002). The environmental factors such as pH and 
substrate concentration affect the metabolic pathway during dark fermentative hydrogen 
production (Lin et al., 2006; Lay et al., 2007).  
The soluble metabolic product (SMP) included acetate (HAc), propionate (HPr), 
iso-butyrate (i-HBu), n-butyrate (n-HBu), and ethanol (EtOH). Fig 2 indicated that the 
SMP concentrations increased as pH increased from 4.5 to 7.0, which values gave peak 
H2 productivity. However, SMP concentrations decreased with pH ＞ 7.0. Ethanol is 
another important liquid fermentation product being used as an energy carrier. At high 
pHs of 7-10, ethanol concentration was quite high (9.0-10.0 g COD/L) at BF 
concentration 50 g COD/L. In the presented study, butyrate fermentation type reaction 
also resulted in efficient hydrogen production (Lin et al., 2006). At pH 6.0-8.0, higher 
HPRm (132-244 mmol H2/L/d) were determined with major metabolite of butyrate 
(i-HBu + n-HBu, 46-72 %).

the future because it can be efficiently converted into electricity via fuel cell technology 
and is also cleanly combustible without formation of CO2 (Das and Verzioglu, 2001; 
Levin et al., 2004). Biological hydrogen production via direct/indirect water 
biophotolysis or dark/photo fermentation (Das and Verzioglu, 2001) is an energy 
effective and environmentally friendly route of producing H2 (Claassen et al., 2005). 
Among them, dark fermentation is considered as the most commercially feasible 
biological means of producing H2 due to its high H2 production rate and an additional 
benefit of waste reduction (Levin et al., 2004). 
The biohydrogen research team in Feng Chia University has successfully developed an 
effective screening method for indigenous hydrogen-producing bacterial strains as well 
as a high-rate hydrogen-producing process of agitated granular sludge bed reactor 
(AGSBR) system. This system has a high chemical reaction rate due to effective contact 
among the reacting phases with higher heat and mass transfer (Lee et al., 2004; Chen et 
al., 2002; Chang et al., 2001) compared to other processes. The hydrogen production 
rate of the CIGSB system reached 7.2 mol H2/L/d, which is 4-fold higher than the 
reported values. This achievement indicates the world-leading role of biohydrogen 
production technology.  This technology was financially supported by Bureau of 
Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan, and is to be commercialized. Therefore, 
a 300 L fermenter pilot plant of this system has been constructed for developing the 
scale-up operation parameters. The present work introduces the pilot plant technology.  
This development widens the range of applications of the biohydrogen technology and 
provides valuable information that able to facilitate commercialization of the 
fermentative hydrogen production processes.  In addition, the outcome of this work 
would be of great help in ensuring the pivotal role of Taiwan in global development of 
biohydrogen technology. 
 
THE FLOW SHEET OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM 
Most hydrogen fermentation has been conducted in well-mixed systems, such as 
anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, continuously stirred tank reactor, carrier-induced 
granular sludge bed, membrane bioreactor and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket.  
However, when the biological system was operating at short hydraulic retention time, 
washout of suspended cells might occur and results in operational instability and 
lowering the hydrogen production rate.  In this 300 L pilot plant, we use agitated

MAIN UNITS 
The hydrogen fermentation system has five main units and their facilities are listed in 
Table 1. 
Feedstock Feeding 
During a lab-scale experiment, substrate and nutrients are generally mixed-up and 
stored at a refrigerator for usage. However, it is energy-consuming for a practical-scale 
hydrogen fermentation system. Therefore, a new feedstock feeding method with ease 
and energy-saving operation was tested. Carbon source and nutrient were separately 
stored but mixed-up before being fed into the fermenter. Two backup storage tanks were 
used for these two influents. With this feed method, substrate refrigeration was 
unnecessary and the loading for substrate preparation was well reduced.

plants are substantially less expensive than a full-scale plant. The pilot plant can provide 
valuable data for designing a full-scale plant. Scientific data about reaction process, 
hydrodynamic behaviour in the system and bacterial community will be available from 
the pilot plant operation.

Abstract 
The effects of pH and substrate concentrations on fermentative hydrogen 
production from preserved fruits soaking solution was investigated by response surface 
methodology. Anaerobic wastewater sludge obtained from a paper mill factory was used 
as the seed sludge. The experiments of pH and substrate concentrations effects were 
conducted at pH 4–8 and 1.24-6.20 g COD/L, respectively. Batch experimental results 
indicate that hydrogen production yield peaked with 2.64 mol H2/mol glucose at a 
soaking solution concentration of 3.72 g COD/L and pH 6 without nutrient. Comparing 
the hydrogen production with other actual wastewaters, using waste soaking solution as 
the substrate could obtain high hydrogen production yield. Throughout this study, the 
hydrogen gas content in the biogas was from 3.3 to 50.6 % and no methane was 
observed. According to the response surface analysis, the peak hydrogen yield and H2 
concentration were obtained at pH 6.0. High ethanol concentration was obtained at high 
substrate concentration and pH. The maximum total volatile fatty acid concentrations 
were obtained at high substrate concentration and low pH (without nutrients) but 
obtained at the soaking solution concentration of 6.0 g COD/L and pH 6.5 (nutrients 
addition).

concentrations were conducted at 1.24-6.20 g COD/L. The total gas and total volatile 
fatty acids (VFAs) production at the 68 h cultivation and their compositions were 
determined. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
Two series of batch experiments were conducted. The hydrogen production 
potential was tested (1) without nutrients (Run 1-10) and (2) with adding nutrients (Run 
11-20) to determine the need for nutrient addition (Table 1). The fed medium contained 
sufficient inorganic supplements including NH4HCO3 (5240 mg/l), K2HPO4 (125 mg/l), 
MgCl2•6H2O (100 mg/l), MnSO4•6H2O (15 mg/l), FeSO4•7H2O (25 mg/l), 
CuSO4•5H2O (5 mg/l), CoCl2•5H2O (0.125 mg/l), and NaHCO3 (6720 mg/l) [4]. 
2.3. Analytical method 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods [5] were used to determine pH, 
ORP and VSS concentration of liquid content. Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a 
gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). 
Biogas volume was determined by a gas meter (Ritter, Germany) and gas composition 
was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector (China 
Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details for the VFA, ethanol and biogas assays 
were the same as those indicated in our previous studies [2, 6]. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Hydrogen production 
Conversion efficiency represents the hydrogen-producing yield on a defined 
substrate. To evaluate the relationship between substrate concentration and the 
conversion efficiency, the design matrix with the corresponding conversion efficiency in 
Table 1 were subjected to regression analysis, and the regression equation and ternary 
figure were generated as shown in Table 2 and Figs. 1~2. The hydrogen gas content in 
the biogas was from 3.3 to 50.6 % and no methane was observed. In Table 1, the 
hydrogen production yield and concentration in Run 1~10 (without nutrient) were 
higher than that of Run 11~20 (with nutrient). This result indicates that the soaking 
solution itself contained enough nutrients for hydrogen fermentation.  
The hydrogen production yield peaked with 2.64 mol H2/mol glucose at the 
soaking solution concentration of 3.72 g COD/L and pH 6 without nutrient (Table 1). 
The hydrogen production yields of some actual wastewaters were summarized in Table 
3. Comparing the hydrogen production with other actual wastewaters, using waste 
soaking solution as the substrate could obtain high hydrogen production yield (2.64 mol 
H2/mol glucose).

promote the hydrogen production in dark fermentation. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The followings can be concluded from the experimental results. 
1. Preserved fruits soaking solution could be used to produce hydrogen without any nutrient addition. 
2. The hydrogen production yield peaked with 2.64 mol H2/mol glucose at the soaking solution 
concentration of 3.72 g COD/L and pH 6 without nutrient. Comparing the hydrogen production with 
other actual wastewaters, using waste soaking solution as the substrate could obtain high hydrogen 
production yield. 
3. High ethanol concentration was obtained at high preserved soaking solution concentration and pH. 
Nutrient addition affected VFA concentrations. The maximum total VFA concentrations were 
obtained at high substrate concentration and low pH (without nutrients) but obtained at the soaking 
solution concentration of 6.0 g COD/L and pH 6.5 (nutrients addition).

hydrogen production is well used (Lin et al., 2000; Li and Fang, 2007). Moreover, each organism 
has a pH range within which growth is possible and this pH range usually has a well-defined pH 
optimum (Brock et al., 1994). In any biohydrogen production system, pH affects process 
efficiency in terms of substrate utilization, hydrogen production activity, and distribution of liquid 
product or microbial community. To what extents pH affects rice straw-degrading mixed 
anaerobic microflora for hydrogen production has seldom been elucidated.  
Based on these considerations, this research was aimed at investigating the 
hydrogen–producing bioactivity of non pretreatment and thermal enriched anaerobic mixed 
microflora at various initial cultivation pH values for batch-fermenting rice straw. Specifically, 
the effects of these factors on hydrogen gas content and hydrogen yield (the ability converting 
starch into hydrogen, HY) were determined. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Seed sludge and Substrate 
The seed sludge was obtained from two municipal sewage treatment plants (Sludges W1 and 
W2), cow dung compost (Sludge C) and a paper manufacture plant (Sludge T1). The seed thermal 
enrichment was pre-treating the sludges with heat at 95℃ for 40 minutes. Seed sludges without 
thermal pretreatment were used as the comparisons.  
The rice straw was obtained from a rice field in middle Taiwan. Using a pulverizer to smash 
the rice straw as the substrate that passed through the 0.297 mm sieve. The substrate rice straw 
concentration was 30 g straw/L (W/V). The fed medium contained sufficient inorganic 
supplements (mg/l) including NH4HCO3 5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, 
FeSO4•7H2O 25, CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125 and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1985). 
2.2. Experimental design and procedure 
Hydrogen-production batch experiments were performed in serum vials with a working 
volume of 125 ml. The vials were initially gassed with argon gas followed by seed microflora (25 
ml) and substrate (20 ml) addition. The vials were placed in a reciprocal air-bath shaker (150 rpm) 
with the temperature controlled at 55 ± 1◦C. In the Experiment I, the initial cultivation pH and 
temperature were controlled at 6.5 and 55℃, respectively. In the Experiment II, the initial 
cultivation pH values were from 3.5 to 8.0 with an interval of 0.5 units. The total gas and total 
VFAs production at the 68 h cultivation and their compositions were determined. Each 
experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. 
2.3. Analytical method 
The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) were used to determine pH, 
oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express biomass) 
concentrations of liquid content. Ethanol and VFA were analyzed with a gas chromatograph 
having a flame ionization detector (Shimadze GC-14, Japan). Biogas volume was determined by 
a gas meter (Ritter, Germany) and gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph 
having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). Other analytical details 
for the VFAs, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those indicated in our previous studies

The liquid product produced by the anaerobic sludge without thermal enrichment is 
summarized in Table 3. The VFAs were acetate (HAc, 506-1698 mg COD/L), propionate (HPr, 
104-358 mg COD/L), butyrate (HBu, 116-414 mg COD/L) and valerate (HVa, 19-70) and ethanol 
(EtOH, 43-98) showing HAc was the dominant one. Many works also reveal that the main 
products are acetate and butyrate in the fermentation of carbohydrate by Clostridium species and 
most are of butyrate-pathway (Lin et al., 2006). However, the present results reveal that hydrogen 
production from rice straw was of acetate-pathway. 
Table 4 summarizes the liquid products produced from fermenting rice straw using the 
thermal enrichment sludges to generate hydrogen. The VFAs were HAc (3070-4261 mg COD/L), 
HPr (228-486 mg COD/L), iso-butyric acid (i-HBu, 63-208 mg COD/L), HBu (283-494 mg 
COD/L) and HVa (64-303 mg COD/L) and ethanol (EtOH, 768-1042 mg COD/L) with HAc the 
dominant one. Iso-HBu was determined. Comparing the VFA concentrations produced by these 
two pretreated seed sludges, it is known that the thermal enrichment sludge produced the liquid 
products in an increasing tendency except that of HBu by Sludge W1. Table 5 reveals the 
concentration increments of the liquid products by the thermally-enriched sludge showing 
thermal treatment enhancing liquid product production by 114-391%. However, the HBu 
concentration produced by Sludge W1 was reduced by 32% when the seed sludge was 
thermally-treated. Noted that thermally-treated Sludge W1 was the only seed sludge that had a 
decrease in hydrogen production when compared with that of non thermal-treated sludge (Table 
1). These results reveal that Sludge W1 contained some specific microorganisms different from 
the other seed sludges.

The experimental results indicated that hydrogen production from rice straw by sewage 
sludge microflora was of acetate-fermentation type. Sludge W1 contained special species that can 
directly degrade rice straw and produce hydrogen. Hydrogen production from rice straw by 
mixed anaerobic microflora was initial cultivation pH-dependent; heat-treatment on seed sludge 
could enhance hydrogen production. The optimal pH values for Sludge W1 to produce hydrogen 
were around 6.0-7.0 with peak HY of 7.4 ml/g. The thermal treatment of Sludge W1 enhanced 
liquid product production by 114-391%.

Abstract Under the financial support from Taiwan’s Bureau of Energy and Feng Chia 
University (FCU), the FCU biohydrogen research team has successfully developed a high-rate 
hydrogen production process able to produce H2 at a maximum rate of 15 L/L/h. En route 
toward commercialization of this highly efficient hydrogen fermentation system, a 400 L 
 101 
with a warm-water jacket for temperature control. The fermentor had a set of pneumatic motors 
controlling butterfly blender with an agitation speed of 10-15 rpm. The system control panel could control 
and detect the motor speed, temperature, solenoid valve switch, fluid flow, pressure, and hydrogen 
concentration of the environment. This monitoring system detected and recorded the data continuously 
(Lin et al., 2008). 
 
Seed sludge 
The seed sludge was collected from a beach in western Taiwan and was heat-treated (100oC for 
45 min) to inhibit the methanogenic activity. The heat-treated sludge was seeded into a 1 L 
agitated granular sludge bed reactor (AGSBR) operated at a HRT of 2 h at 37±1oC for 2 weeks. 
The operation pH was controlled at 6. The acclimation substrate was sucrose (20 g COD/L). The 
substrate solution contained the following inorganic supplements (Endo formulation, mg/L): 
NH4HCO3 5240, K2HPO4 125, MgCl2•6H2O 100, MnSO4•6H2O 15, FeSO4•7H2O 25, 
CuSO4•5H2O 5, CoCl2•5H2O 0.125, and NaHCO3 6720 (Endo et al., 1982). The hydrogen gas 
contents in AGSBR were 35-40%. 
 
Start-up strategy and hydrogen production in the fermentor 
At the beginning, 60 L of cultivated seed sludge and 300 L of substrate and nutrient solution were mixed 
in the fermentor using a batch strategy for one day to enhance the biomass concentration. The mixed 
liquid in the fermentor was first purged with argon gas for 10 min to ensure an anaerobic condition prior to 
H2 fermentation experiments. The system was then switched to a continuous-feeding mode (HRT 12 h) 
after 48 h in batch operation. 
This pilot-scale fermentor was fed on sucrose (20 g/L) and operated at 35oC. The nutrient solution 
contained the same nutrients (Endo formulation) used for the seed sludge (Endo et al., 1982). A varied 
NaHCO3 concentration (2.62-5.24 g/L) was used for maintaining the pH to 6.0.  
During the experiments, the quantity and composition of gas products (mainly, CO2 and H2) and the 
soluble microbial products (SMP) were monitored at a designated time interval. The biogas volumes 
measured by a natural gas meter (provided from Shin Chung Natural gas Co. Ltd) were corrected to a 
temperature of 25oC and a pressure of 1 atm. The hydrogen yield was calculated based on mmol of H2 
produced per gram of sucrose consumed. 
 
 
Analytical methods 
The composition of product gas was measured with a China Chromatography 8700T gas chromatograph 
(GC) equipped with a packed (packing, Porapak Q), stainless steel column and a thermal conductivity 
detector. Oven, injector, and detector temperatures were 40, 40, and 40 °C, respectively. Argon was used 
as the carrier gas. The concentrations of ethanol and organic acids were measured using a Shimadzu 
GC-14A GC equipped with a glass column (packing, FON), and a flame ionization detector. Oven, injector, 
and detector temperatures were 145, 175, and 185°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas 
(Chen et al, 2002; Lin and Chang, 1999). Anthrone-sufuric acid method was used to measure residual 
sucrose concentration (Dubois et al., 1956).The analytical procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1995) 
were used to determine pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and volatile suspended solid (VSS) 
 103 
93.5±1.4% at steady-state operation (days 21-30). 
 
Biogas production 
The start-up performance of the pilot-scale hydrogen fermentation system was evaluated in terms of BPR, 
HPR, and hydrogen yield (HY). Figure 2 depicts the variations in BPR, HPR, and HY. After the batch 
operation, the H2 content, BPR, and HPR reached 17%, 9.84 m
3/m3/d, 0.46 m3/m3/d, respectively. The 
BPR and HPR values ranged from 0.73-16.9 m3/m3/d and 0.42-5.22 m3/m3/d, respectively. Table 1 shows 
that the average HPR values at steady-state operation (days 21-30, HRT 12 h) was 18 folds higher than 
that obtained at the batch mode (days 0-2). These values were similar to a HPR value of 5.57 m3/m3/d 
reported by Ren et al. (2006) using substrate molasses with a pilot-scale bioreactor system. The peak HY 
was 2.34 mol H2/mol sucrose at day 15. Similar HY results were also obtained in our pervious study (Chen 
et al., 2008). The average HY values at steady-state operation (days 21-30, HRT 12 h) was 5.7 folds higher 
than that at the batch mode (days 0-2). The hydrogen content at the fed-batch mode (days 0-2) was only 
5.6%, but it increased to 10.8-35.8% at the continuous-feed mode (days 3-30). 
 
 
Productions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol 
Hydrogen production by anaerobic degradation of organics is accompanied with production of soluble 
microbial products (SMP, = VFA + ethanol). There were three liquid sample ports on the fermentor. As 
indicated in Table 1, the average SMP concentrations were 3,102±1494, 10,088±2,184, and 11,245±749 
mg COD/L while the fermentor was at batch operation (days 0-2), continuous operation at unsteady state 
(days 3-20) and continuous operation at steady state (days 21-30), respectively. Efficient hydrogen 
production is always accompanied with metabolites production (Chen et al., 2008). For instance, low VFA 
concentration of 2491±1030 mg COD/L was obtained at the batch mode (days 0-2), while the BPR and 
HPR values were also low.  
At batch operation (days 0-2) and unsteady-state continuous operation (days 3-20), a constant metabolite 
distribution was obtained with acetate 21.2-22.1%, propionate 12.2-19.2%, iso-butyrate 23.5-31.7%, 
normal-butyrate 7.4-18.2% and ethanol 19.7-24.8% (Table 2). Butyrate (iso and normal) was the major 
SMP and its distribution decreased to 48.9% at steady-state operation (days 21-30). Lin et al. (2006) 
reported that the ratios of acetate to butyrate and ethanol to acetate molar concentration (acetate/butyrate 
and ethanol/acetate ratios) might vary with microbial growth condition during fermentation process and 
could be used as an indicator reflecting the progress of hydrogen production. The acetate/butyrate ratio at 
the batch mode (days 0-2) was 1.36, which is in the same magnitude of a ratio of 1.28 obtained from the 
continuous feeding mode (days 3-30) (Table 1). Nevertheless, the acetate molar concentration was higher 
for the batch mode (days 0-2) and steady-state continuous mode (days 21-30), whereas the ethanol molar 
concentration increased during the unsteady-state continuous mode (days 3-20). 
 
Microbial community 
The composition of the microfloras was determined by a molecular-biological method without cultivation. 
In this study, a PCR-DGGE protocol was developed for the detection of bacterial composition shifts in the 
fermenter by 35-days operation. The DGGE band patterns and their indicated bacteria species are 
presented in Figure 3. For the operation of days 0-13, the bacterial population included Clostridium

本次會議第五階段是 12 月 28 日的技術參訪，參訪哈爾濱工業大學的「生物製
氫工場」。哈爾濱工業大學所開發之生物製氫模場於 2005 年建構完成，生物製氫反
應槽體積 63.5 m3。在有機負荷 68.21 kg COD/m3/d 的糖蜜培養下，最高產氫速率可
達 5.26 m3 H2/m3 reactor/day、氫氣產率 347 m3/day、比產氫速率有 0.83 m3 H2/kg 
VSS/day。並評估使用該設備分解碳水化合物廢水之基質的產氫成本約 US$ 0.17/m3。
參訪過程中，雙方在模場操作技術上進行討論與操作心得分享。參訪途中也去雪雕
公園，是哈爾濱市本年度的重要國際活動之ㄧ，令人印象深刻。 
2.與會心得 
「生物氫能」的製程因能源消耗低，CO2 排放量低，具有節能減碳的優勢。在
利用廢棄物生產潔淨能源的同時，所得之減碳效益亦可形成有價值之「碳額度」，故
由環境減廢、能源生產、製程減碳以及碳額度交易的整體角度來看，生質氫能之製
程實深具經濟效益。 
近年來，生物產氫技術已推展至商業化製程基礎之模場化階段。台灣(逢甲大學
生物產氫研究團隊)擁有領先國際之高速率產氫技術，以此技術為基礎，在 2007 年
建構完成世界首座之高速率產氫工場。以蔗糖為基質，所得之成果尚領先哈爾濱之
生物產氫製氫系統。國內另有國立成功大學鄭幸雄教授研究團隊正推動區域性廚餘
回收再能源化示範場、逢甲大學生物產氫研究團隊及工研院能環所皆有建立「厭氧
生物產氫模場」；在國外，美國、日本、中國大陸及英國亦有大規模的模場技術研究，
顯見「生質產氫技術」深具商業化之潛能，也受世界各國之重視。 
目前國際間的氫能研究正如火如荼地進行著，歐、美、日、韓等國都有自己的
「氫經濟社會」(hydrogen economy)藍圖。在目前生物產氫技術在國際間獨占鼇頭
的台灣，為持續保持國際領先地位，政府應以加速生物產氫量產能力為目標，並整
合國內儲氫、氫能源轉換與應用技術及生物氫能醱酵廢液等後端再利用技術等，鼓
勵民間企業參與投資，讓社會大眾對未來的「氫經濟社會」有更清楚的瞭解，藉以
朝著「潔淨能源-氫能台灣」之目標邁進，使「氫能」讓能源短缺的台灣，在國際舞
台上發光發熱。

substrates used for fermentative hydrogen production in CSTR are generally rich in 
carbohydrates like glucose (Lin and Chang, 1999; Mizuno et al., 2000), sucrose (Fang et al., 2002; 
Chen and Lin, 2003; Shin et al., 2004), starch (Lay, 2000; Lin et al., 2008), cellulose (Ueno et al., 
2001) and some actual wastewaters (Noike et al., 2002). 
Condensed molasses fermentation soluble (CMS) is a by-product from the microbial fermentation 
of molasses. CMS contained many kinds of microorganisms (Chang et al., 2008). Thermal 
pretreatment on some feeding substrates is efficient for elevating hydrogen production by 
inhibiting some microorganisms. Noike et al. (2002) reported that the inhibitory effect of lactic 
acid bacteria (LAB) on hydrogen production was caused by bacteriocins excreted from LAB. The 
inhibition of hydrogen production was reduced by heat treatment for 30 min at temperatures 
ranging from 50oC to 90oC. Another report on enhancing hydrogen production shows that thermal 
pretreatment of the influent CMS was at 60°C for 10 min and 40-70°C for 10-30 min for CSTR 
and up-flow anaerobic fermenter systems, respectively (Lin et al., 207). The results indicated that 
the pretreatment of CMS at a temperature of 40°C for 20 min increased hydrogen gas content by 
40% to a total content of 36% and HPR by 35% to 124 mmol H2/L/d. It means that a temperature 
of 40oC is already adequate to prevent the growth of hydrogen-consuming methanogens.  
Based on the above considerations, in his work the substrate CMS was pretreated at 60℃ for 10 
min to inhibit the hydrogen-consuming bacteria and enhance hydrogen production efficiency. The 
purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency of hydrogen production from CMS. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Seed sludge 
The seed sludge was obtained from waste activated sludge from the Li-Ming Municipal Sewage 
Treatment Plant in Taichung, Taiwan. The collected sludge was screened with a No. 8 mesh (dia. 
2.35 mm) and heated at 100°C for 45 minutes (to inhibit hydrogen consuming methanogen 
bioactivity). The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express the biomass concentrations) and 
TS (total solids) concentrations of the seed sludge were 6.92, 46330 mg/L and 72080 mg/L, 
respectively. 
 
Substrate 
Substrate wastewater was prepared from concentrated molasses-fermented soluble (320-350 g 
COD/L) from Vedan Corp, Taiwan. This molasses wastewater contained various nutrients and 
other fermentation products such as microbial protein, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, and 
coenzymes (Table 1). This molasses wastewater was diluted to 10-160 g COD/L for use. The 
substrate was pretreated at 60℃ for 10 min to inhibit the hydrogen-consuming bacteria and 
enhance hydrogen production efficiency. 
 
Experimental procedures 
A CSTR hydrogen fermenter (Fig. 1) with a working volume of 4.0 L was operated at a 
temperature of 35℃ and an HRT of 3-24 h. The fermenter was constantly mixed at 250 rpm with 
a flow level controller. A pH of 5.5 (favorable value for hydrogen production) was maintained 
 117 
mmol H2/L-d (at 40 g COD/L-d and HRT 24 h). This value is also higher than HPR of 228 mmol 
H2/L-d at 320 g COD/L-d and a HRT of 3 h from molasses 69 g COD/L and a HRT of 4 h (Ren et 
al., 2004). H2 content in the biogas varied from 35.9% to 51.7%. The maximum HY 2.1 mol 
H2/mol hexose was achieved at 320 g COD/L-day and HRT 2 h but HY decreased to 0.9 mol 
H2/mol hexose at HRT 3 h. 
 
Reactor performance 
ORP values (-355 to -400 mV) were in the range favorable to the biohydrogen generation (Table 
2). Hexose degradation varied from 60.2％at HRT 24 h to 74.9％ at HRT 4 h. The COD recovery 
was from 80-95％ during hydrogen fermentation. Similar results of hexose degradation 70% and 
COD recovery 80% were reported (Ren et al., 2006; Ueno et al., 1996). Table 3 shows that the 
COD recovery was 54.7-64.7％ during HRT 3-24 h.  
The carbohydrate in substrate CMS was converted to soluble microbial product (SMP) such as 
VFA and alcohol. The nitrogen sources were glutamate, protein and NH3-N in CMS. The NH3-N 
concentrations in the substrate CMS were 2698-3223 mg/L. However, the NH3-N concentrations 
in the effluent of HRT 6-24 h were almost the same with the influent. Little organic nitrogen was 
considered to be degraded into biomass with VSS 5.0-5.5 g/L at these retention times. However, 
the NH3-N concentrations in the effluents at HRT 3-4 h were 5.7-7.0% higher than that HRT 6-24 
h with higher VSS of 6.5 g/L. Some reports indicate that some bacteria, such as Acidaminococcus 
fermentans, C. sporosphaeroides and C. symbiosum could convert glutamate to produce hydrogen, 
NH4+ and acetate (Wohlfahrt et al., 1985). Our previous results show that Acidaminococcus sp. 
was the major strain at HRT 3 h (Chang et al., 2008). 
 
 
Variation in SMP concentrations during hydrogen production 
The end products of H2 fermentation include gases (H2 and CO2) and soluble metabolites (organic 
acid and alcohols). The SMP produced included ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and 
valerate during the hydrogen fermentation (Table 2). The maximum TVFA concentrations were 
obtained at long HRT 24 h but it decreased with HRT decreasement. Table 3 and Fig. 3 show that 
butyrate was the main soluble metabolite in the fermentation. Nevertheless, the butyrate contents 
in the SMP decreased but acetate increased with HRT reduction. The reason of SMP composition 
changed should be that the major microbial communities were shifted from clostridial strains to 
Acidaminococcus sp. at short HRT (Chang et al., 2008).  
In general, production of acetate and butyrate favors hydrogen production according to equations 
1 and 2 (Koskinen et al., 2008): 
 
C6H12O6 +4H2O→2CH3COO- + 2HCO3- +4H+                              (1) 
C6H12O6→CH3CH2CH2COO- + 2HCO3- +3H (2) 
 
In ethanol production pathway no hydrogen is consumed nor produced (Eq 3). However, coupled 
ethanol and acetate production pathways exist (Eq 4) with a theoretical production of 2 mol H2 
 119 
HRT and OLR are main operation parameters of a continuous H2 fermentation process. Generally, 
short HRT (high OLR) is favorable to hydrogen fermentation (Koskinen, 2008). The CMS reactor 
gave an optimal hydrogen performance at a  high OLR of 240 g COD/d than that of OLR 68 g 
COD/d for the molasses reactor.  
Using thermally-pretreated (100oC, 45 min) sewage sludge as the seed and thermally-pretreated 
(60oC, 10 min) CMS as the substrate at long HRT is a proper start-up strategy for hydrogen 
fermentation. The reactor with good hydrogen production performance was obtained when it was 
operated at 35oC, pH 5.5 and high OLR. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
CMS was an ideal and commercial potential substrate for hydrogen fermentation because it is a 
kind of food wastewater and contained sacchariferous and nutrient components that are necessary 
for bacterial growth. Co-cultivating Clostridium and Acidaminococcus strains efficiently 
increases consuming the carbohydrates and monosodium glutamate contained in CMS to enhance 
hydrogen productivity. A CSTR could be operated at HRTs of 24-3 h at a CMS concentration of 
40 g COD/L without adding nutrients for about 700 days. Peak HPR 390 mmol H2/L-d 
occurred at an OLR of 320 g COD/L-d at a HRT of 3 h. Peak HY of 2.1 mol H2/mol hexose 
was achieved with an OLR of 320 g COD/L-day at a HRT of 12 h.

Abstract 
Dark fermentation is the most potential technology for H2 production due to its high 
production rate, technical simplicity, and few energy requirements. To investigate the core 
technology for hydrogen fermentation, synthetic wastewaters, such as glucose, xylose and 
sucrose were well used as the feedstocks. However, to enhance the commercial viability of bioH2, 
a low-cost and easy-conversion feedstock should be used. Among the possible candidates, starch, 
cellulose and actual wastewaters are considered as the cost-effective feedstocks for the 
commercialization of biohydrogen production. Environmental parameters affect the cellulosic 
hydrolysis enzyme activity and the metabolic pathways in anaerobic fermentation production 
processes. However, literatures (Lin and Fang, 2007; Hawks et al., 2007) indicate that various 
optimal operation conditions for this process have been carried out. In the present study, therefore, 
the effects of substrate concentration (15 and 30 g COD/L), temperature (30 and 55oC), pH (6 and 
8), nutrient (Endo et al., 1982) addition and optimal operation condition on hydrogen production 
from oil extracted biomass residue using sewage sludge seed were investigate by batch tests. The 
experimental result indicate that the peak hydrogen production yield of 2.11 mL/g-residue was 
obtained at pH 8, temperature 55oC and without nutrient addition. The main effect analysis result 
indicates that the effective levels were temperature > nutrient addition > substrate concentration > 
pH. These results indicate that the oil extracted biomass residue contains nutrients necessary for 
hydrogen-producing bacteria in anaerobic fermentation.

Abstract 
There is annual 6.5×106 metric tons of agricultural wastes in Taiwan and 30% of those are rice straw waste. The 
anaerobic degradation of organics produces volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ethanol, hydrogen gas and methane. Disposal 
of the rice straw waste results in environmental pollution problems and squanders natural biomass resources. 
Hydrogen is a promising candidate as an ideal and clean source of energy in the future. It was demonstrated that the 
addition of surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (commercially also known as Tween 80), 
significantly increased the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses (Eriksson et al., 2002; Goto et al., 2003). 
Increased hydrolysis by the addition of surfactant was reported for delignified various plants, such as wood, orchard 
grass and corn stover (Helle et al., 1993; Goto et al., 2003; Kaar and Holtzapple, 1998). Surfactants have positive 
interactions with the microbial growth, intermediate production and dry matter degradability in rumen in vivo (Goto 
et al., 2003). However, some literature investigated the effect of surfactant Tween 80 on the conversion of rice straw 
wastes into biohydrogen by waste sludge microflora. Thus, based on these considerations, this research was aimed at 
investigating the conversion effect of rice straw wastes into biohydrogen by the addition of surfactant Tween 80. 
The experimental results indicated that the cumulative hydrogen production amounts were 9.6, 5.4, 3.4, 6.8, 
9.0, 3.9 and 0.004 ml for the concentration of Tween 80 were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 ml/l, respectively. There is no 
increasing effect of hydrogen gas production after the addition of surfactant Tween 80. However, the initial time of 
producing hydrogen gas on the blank test was about 20 hours, and the test that added Tween 80 could shorten the 
initial time of producing hydrogen gas to 8 hours. These results demonstrate the similar effect of catalytic agent on 
the addition of surfactant Tween 80 on the conversion of rice straw wastes into biohydrogen. It could accelerate the 
reaction time but no effect on increasing the amount of cumulative hydrogen production. 
The VFAs on the blank test were acetate (HAc, 841 mg COD/L), propionate (HPr, 248 mg COD/L), 
iso-butyrate (i-HBu, 386 mg COD/L) and butyrate (HBu, 74 mg COD/L) and ethanol (EtOH, 198 mg COD/L). This 
result showed HAc was the dominant liquid product. Many works also reveal that the main products are acetate and 
butyrate in the fermentation of carbohydrate by Clostridium species and most are of butyrate-pathway (Lin et al., 
2006). The blank test results reveal that hydrogen production from rice straw was acetate-pathway. However, when 
the surfactant Tween 80 was added, the concentration of HAc were decreased to 89-168 mg COD/L but the 
concentration of ethanol were increased to 364-1210 mg COD/L. The increments of ethanol production as compared 
with the blank test were 184-611 %. The pathway of hydrogen production from rice straw shifted to ethanol-pathway 
that decreased the hydrogen gas production but increased the ethanol production. The effect of increasing ethanol 
production on other microorganism that preferred to produce ethanol need to research further. 
 
Key words: anaerobic fermentation, hydrogen production, rice straw, surfactant, Tween 80.
