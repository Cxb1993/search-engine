（一） 英文摘要 
The embedded non-volatile memory (Embedded NVM) is widely used for carry-on electric equipments 
in recent years. Therefore, the research and development of NVM is more and more important. In this 
project, a new BJT-switch RRAM cell and a current-sampling-based sense amplifier are developed.  
 A new 3D vertical BJT RRAM with CMOS compatible process is demonstrated. The high density 3D 
RRAM cell can operate with superior set/reset efficiency and good reliability by a novel small size and high 
performance. 
 The current-sampling-based sense amplifier can sense the current as small as 100nA. If the voltage of 
bitline is very high, the data stored in RRAM cell may be re-write and cause an error. Therefore the voltage 
have to be low and cause small current. We can use this small current sense amplifier to help sensing the 
value of the data in RRAM cell precisely. 
 We will continue the research for RRAM circuits with higher performance based on these results in the 
future. 
（二） 中文摘要 
在可攜式手機、電腦日漸普及的時代，內嵌式非揮發性記憶體(Embedded NVM)被廣泛應用攜帶式
電子設備之中。因此非揮發性記憶體及周邊電路的研發也日益重要，本計畫中研發一新型BJT-switch 
電阻式記憶胞，以及一可感測小記憶胞電流之感測放大器。 
研發的新型CMOS 製程BJT-switch 記憶胞為一3D 結構記憶胞，利用3D 架構，可大大增加記憶胞
陣列的密度。此記憶胞擁有高效率的寫入能力，並擁有高穩定、高效能的特性。 
感測小記憶胞電流之感測放大器，則可以在極低(100nA)的電流下，準確量測出記憶胞所儲存的
值。由於在電阻式記憶體讀取資料時，不能將位元線施加太高的電壓，否則會造成記憶單元之電阻值
轉態，造成資料翻轉。因此，電阻式記憶胞所流出之可感測電流並不大，此感測放大器可用來準確量
測電阻式記憶胞所流出小電流。 
未來我們將以本次研究成果為基礎，繼續研發更高效能的的RRAM 電路。

可以大大降低成本。從2000 年以來，關於RRAM 的研究與論文數量逐年增加，成為電機電子業、物理
材料界爭相研究的新領域。目前世界各國於RRAM 的元件製作上都有長足的進步與發展，也證明了RRAM
確實具有成為記憶元件的能力，唯其性能還有待進一步最佳化。此外其物理現象與規律機制尚不明
確，仍有待進一步的實驗與歸納，將為當前首要任務之一。 
（二） 適用於接觸點電阻式記憶體之周邊電路:  
針對接觸點電阻式記憶體之小可感測電流以及高寫入電壓此兩需求，開發接觸點電阻式記憶體之
關鍵性的電路，我們設定目標為完成能夠滿足此兩需求的前瞻式電路。 
在電阻式記憶體上，有兩個關鍵性的電路，一是寫入(set/reset)功能所需要的高電壓產生電路，
一是讀取資料時的感測放大器電路。由於在電阻式記憶體讀取資料時，電阻式記憶胞所流出之可感測
電流並很小，容易造成電阻式記憶體讀取感測失敗。因此，本計畫將開發擁有能感測小電流之感測放
大器，進行精確的感測，使得電阻式記憶體可正常操作。 
 
文獻探討 
 國內外有關內嵌式非揮發性記憶體之研究情況: 
 磁電阻式隨機存取記憶體(MRAM)及相變化隨機存取記憶體(PCRAM)因高速以及高容量，在近年來
也被做為內嵌式記憶體用途。速度皆比快閃記憶體快速，容量上可比動態隨機記憶體(DRAM)。此兩種
記憶體有著高電阻值狀態(HRS)以及低電阻值狀態(LRS)來儲存資料。 
MRAM 是藉由組合不同磁階層，產生一個多層次的通道接合點(MTJ)，依磁場狀態可產生帄行磁態及非
帄行磁態，兩種狀態有不同的電阻值，用來儲存邏輯0 和1。MRAM 在寫入時，需要高電流(>300uA)
來改變磁態，產生的電阻值差異不大(參考：8kohm~16kohm [2])，但因電阻值小，因此感測電流較大，
可以穩定的感測出正確的資料。MRAM 的特點為近乎無限的持久度(infinite endurance)，目前有做
到4MB 之Toggle MRAM [3]，及新型Wiggle MRAM [2] 和運作干擾(disturb)很小的STT MRAM [4]。 
 PCRAM 是透過不同相位的晶格狀態時有不同的電阻值，依阻值而有不同的記憶胞電流，來儲存資
料。PCRAM 在寫入時，需要高溫度(>600℃)來轉換晶格狀態，因此需要供給高電流的脈衝(high 
current pulse) > 600uA [5] 來產生高能量使之產生高溫度來轉換。PCRAM 之高電阻值和低電阻值
差異有著10~100 倍的差異，和MRAM 的約兩倍差異大了很多。目前在90nm CMOS 製程下Samsung公司
製作出512-Mb 高容量PCRAM [6], [7]。 
MRAM 在寫入時需要大電流(>300A)，PCRAM 則需要近乎MRAM 兩倍的電流(>600uA)，相較之下，
RRAM 在電流需求就小得非常多(約150uA)，省了約50%的功耗(power)，在下一世代的NVM中比較起來
就RRAM 特別的引人注目。 
 目前國內外對於金屬氧化物電阻式隨機存取記憶體的研究非常多元，主要組成為金屬氧化物NiOX, 
TiO2, HfO2, WOx, ZnO [8]-[13]。其狀態分為低電阻值狀態(LRS)及高電阻值狀態(HRS)，當其在低
阻值狀態時，其金屬氧化物層會產生傳導細絲(Conductive Filament)；而當其為高阻值狀態時，傳
導細絲斷裂，不導通而為高阻值狀態，如圖2-1 [9]。但實際機制並不是完全被了解，根據不同的材
質其特性也不相同，內部轉換的機制也不太相同。

此為傳統電流感測放大器之架構。利用記憶體可感測電流(Icell)不小的特性，和一參考電流(Iref)
比較，進而得到感測資料。由於電流鏡(current mirror)傳遞電流速度很快，也適用於大電流系統。
但同樣的地，在奈米製程下電晶體mismatch 以及threshold 電壓(Vth)飄移，造成感測放大器有輸入
誤差(input offset)，也會使電流感測放大器操作錯誤。 
3. Inverter-type offset-free Sense Amplifier [17] 
 
此一比較器之特點為使用auto-zero 之offset-free 反向器的電壓感測放大器，增益很大，輸入
訊號很小也可以很快速的放大至軌對軌(rail-to-rail)。然而， 和latch-type comparator 相似，
一旦遭受mismatch，甚至因為其單端架構，更易遭受雜訊及訊號偏斜(skew)的影響，而產生不可回復
的錯誤輸出。 
在小電流的情況下，以傳統電流感測放大器的架構很難達成正確的感測。電流感測放大器必須有
參考電流(Reference Current)和記憶胞電流做比較來達成感測資料，但是在小電流的情況下，產生
的感測電流會因製程、電壓、溫度(PVT)的變動以及記憶胞陣列大小而有波動[14]。而且在高階製程
下，傳統的電流感測放大器在輸入電流差距不大時，容易遭受不對稱(mismatch)的影響，感測出錯誤
的資料。因電阻式記憶體之可感測電流很小，本計畫必須要設計一個在小電流的情形下，在不對稱的
情形下還能精準感測出資料的電流感測放大器。 
研究方法 
 BJT-switch 電阻式記憶胞[18]: 
 本計畫設計的 3D RRAM採用台積電 CMOS 邏輯製成製造，記憶胞可變電阻層由鈦合金與鉿氧化物
組成(圖 1)。記憶胞的電阻層垂直疊在傳統的 BJT上，形成一 3D 立體結構，藉此達到記憶胞面積最
小化的效果，最終組成的記憶胞陣列如圖 2.(a)。採用立體架構的記憶胞，最小面積可以小至 4F2，

而 M1、M2將提供大電流做為預先充電電流，進而提升 SA1與 SA2的電壓。此時通過 M1與 M2的電流，
M1電流主要由充電電流與記憶胞電流組成(IM1=ICELL+IPRE1)，，而通過 M2的電流組要由充電電流與參考
電流所組成(IM2=IREF+IPRE2)，M1、M2的電壓將會儲存於電容 C1、C2之中。 
第二階段為感測階段。於此階段，元件 S3、S4將會關閉，而使得 SA1/SA2 與 BL/DBL 形成斷路，
此時由 M1、M2為 SA1與 SA2充電，SA1與 SA2的電壓會因此慢慢提升。由於 C1 與 C2有交流感應效
應(AC-Coupling)，S1的電壓變化將降低 M2的 Gate電壓(G2電壓)、S2的電壓變化將降低 M1的 Gate
電壓(G1電壓)，我們可藉由此變化結果感測出通過 M1電流與 M2電流的比例，進而讀取記憶胞的值。 
於第三階段，訊號 EN打開元件 M5，小記憶胞電流感測放大器進行訊號放大，產生由 SA1與 SA2
電壓差所決定的數位訊號，完成電流感測的訊號放大。

 BJT-switch 電阻式記憶胞: 
 本計畫的 BJT-switch 記憶胞可配合 CMOS製程，藉此提高良率以及降低成本。本計畫所提出為
一 3D 結構記憶胞，利用 3D 架構，可大大增加記憶胞陣列的密度。此記憶胞擁有高效率的寫入能力，
並擁有高穩定、高效能的特性。寫入時，操作電壓可低至 2V，寫入時間可達 50ns(圖 6)，並可以保
存資料過 106個週期(圖 7)。而高阻態(HRS)與低阻態輸出時，讀取電流差異至少有 17倍以上(圖 8)，
可確保除取資料的穩定性。

Decreasing read cell current (ICELL) has become a key trend in nonvolatile mem-
ory (NVM). This is not only due to device size and VDD scaling while keeping the
same threshold voltage (VTH), but also to the growing spread of the following
applications: 1) multiple-level-cell (MLC) [1-2] to achieve smaller area-per-bit; 2)
lower-VDD [3] to save power consumption; 3) Logic-process-compatible one-
time programming memories (OTP) for embedding into mobile chips. A smaller
ICELL leaves the sense amplifiers (SAs) operation vulnerable to 1) bitline (BL)
level offset due to noise, bias and load (CBL) mismatches and 2) VTH variation.
As device size and BL-pitch is continually scaled down, the above factors have
become major showstopper for SAs. To tolerate these offsets, small-ICELL NVMs
suffer from slow read speed or high read fail probability. Thus, a more largely
offset tolerant SA is a prerequisite to achieve faster read speeds. In this study,
we propose a new offset tolerant current-sampling-based SA (CSB-SA) to
achieve 7× faster read speed than previous SAs for sensing small ICELL. A
fabricated 90nm 512Kb OTP macro, using the CSB-SA and our CMOS-logic-
compatible OTP cell [4], achieves 26ns macro random access time for reading
sub-200nA ICELL. Measurements also confirmed that this 90nm CSB-SA could
achieve sub-100nA sensing.
Many small-ICELL NVMs employ voltage-mode SA (VSA) [2] with a long BL
developing time to tolerate SA offset, at the cost of a reduced read speed.
Current-mode SA (CSA) achieves faster read speeds than VSA [1]. Cascode-
current-load or resistive-divider-like CSAs (RD-CSAs) [1], [5], achieve sub-
100nA sensing, but require long BL settling times to achieve high-accuracy 1st-
stage voltage difference. The inverter-offset-compensated SA (IOC-SA) [6]
reduces the SA offset. However, BL offset and BL settling time still limits its
advantages with regard to VSA/CSA. In comparison with ICELL and a reference-
current (IREF), current-mirror CSA (CM-CSA) [7], has fast read speeds but
cannot sense small ICELL due to its input-stage VTH mismatch. Figure 11.5.1
compares the concepts of CSB-SA with previous SAs. CSB-SA uses the same
MOS device for current sampling and current-ratio amplifying. This enables VTH-
independent current sampling schemes for its differential ICELL and IREF inputs.
This is significantly different from CM-CSA, using different MOS devices for cur-
rent-mirroring or I-V conveying, which results in increased vulnerability to VTH-
mismatch. In addition, CSB-SA uses sampled current to generate fast 1st-stage
voltage difference at its BL-decoupled small-load internal nodes. Unlike VSA or
RD-CSA, which have to develop their 1st-stage voltage on the heavy-load BL
using continuous ICELL driving. IOC alleviates SA VTH-mismatch but with a
complex multi-step VTH-nulling process and numerous switching devices. IOC
also does not cancel the SA offset due to transistor width/length or TOX
variations, and is still vulnerable to BL noise/CBL mismatch. In our CSB-SA, the
sampled currents are insensitive to transistor and CBL mismatch. Thus, CSB-SA
is able to achieve faster read speed while tolerating VTH/BL offset for sensing
small ICELL.
The CSB-SA operations are presented in Fig. 11.5.2. In phase-1 (current
sampling), S1~S4 are turned on to connect the BL and dummy-BL (DBL, at IREF
side) to the diode-connected M1 and M2, respectively. The M1/M2 provide large
precharge current (IPRE) to BL/DBL at the beginning of phase-1. When the
precharge time (TPRE) is sufficient, the node voltage SA1 (VSA1) and SA2 (VSA2)
are high, while the IPRE is low. The drain current of the M1 and M2 is
(IM1=ICELL+IPRE1) and (IM2=IREF+IPRE2), respectively. The gate voltages at the end
of phase-1 for M1 (VG1) and M2 (VG2) are stored on C2 and C1, respectively.
When the IPRE is low enough to be disregarded, the IM1/IM2 is equal to ICELL/IREF,
despite various M1-M2 VTH mismatch conditions. In phase-2 (current-ratio
amplifying), the S3/S4 is switched off to disconnect the SA1/SA2 from BL/DBL.
At the beginning of phase-2, the M1/M2 charges the SA1/SA2 with the current
sampled at phase-1. For a given TP2 period, M1/M2 raises the VSA1/VSA2 by the
amount of ΔVSA1/ΔVSA2. Due to AC-coupling behavior of C1/C2, the ΔVSA1
reduces the VG2 and ΔVSA2 reduces the VG1. This results in an amplification of
the current ratio (CR=IM2/IM1) or current difference (ΔIM1-M2=IM1-IM2) between
M1 and M2. This CR-amplification speeds up the development of difference
(ΔVSA) between VSA1 and VSA2. In phase-3 (2nd-stage amplifying), the EN turns
on the NMOS-latch and pulls down the SA2 while M1 continually charges the
SA1 to VDD. Finally, the digital output is generated at node SA1 and SA2.
Although VTH mismatch between M1 and M2 and different ICELL cause various
ΔVSA at the end of phase-1 (ΔVSA-P1), the CSB-SA does not suffer from sensing
failure. This is because the ΔVSA-P1 can be overcome by ΔIM2-M1 if TP2 is
sufficient, unlike un-recoverable sensing error due to VTH mismatch in CM-CSA.
As the Fig. 11.5.3 shows, the VSA1-VSA2 crossover point of VTH -mismatch case
occurs later than that of the no-mismatch case, but both are able to sense the
100nA ICELL. Although the ΔIM2-M1 is small when sensing small ICELL, the
required TP2 for tolerating large device mismatch is insignificant and remains
independent of CBL, thanks to the small parasitic load at node SA0 and SA1
(disconnection from BL) during phase-2. The TP2 penalty to compensate for the
150mV VTH-mismatch is 0.4% for the access-time of a macro with 2048 cells
per BL. Unlike the CM-CSA suffering from low yield due to VTH variations, the
CSB-SA can achieve 100% yield for sensing sub-100nA. This macro uses an
inactive sub-array to provide the DBLs for IREF without area penalty, as Fig.
11.5.4 shows. This enables the ICELL and IREF branches have improved common-
mode BL precharge behavior. Reducing the TPRE, the IPRE increases but does not
significantly influences the yield of CSB-SA. As switch-point analysis shows,
CSB-SA has 100% yield if its ΔIM1-M2 exceeds 3.8nA~7.8nA when the IPRE2 is
within 100nA. This analysis indicates that CSB-SA is not highly sensitive to IPRE.
When reading a 100nA ICELL with a 50nA IREF, the TPRE can be reduced by 76%
if IPRE2=50nA is used. Thus, CSB-SA can employ a shorter TPRE to achieve a
faster speed than previous SAs.
Figure 11.5.5 shows our OTP cell, which consists of two NMOS transistors in
series with a parasitic U-shaped nitride storage node formed by the two merged
nitride spacers. This cell is logic-process compatible and does not need any
additional process steps/masks. The 90nm cell size is only 0.26µm2, which is
smaller than other logic-process programmable NVMs (i.e. eFuse). A 90nm
512Kb asynchronous NOR-type OTP macro was fabricated. The measured ICELL
of this macro ranges between 160nA and 1µA. One SA in each testchip can use
external ICELL/IREF for exploration of detectable ICELL. From the IREF=50nA test
(Fig. 11.5.6), the detectable Read1 and Read0 ICELL are 70nA~85nA and
25nA~5nA, respectively. This OTP macro is functional from VDD=1.4V to 0.85V.
The minimum access time of this OTP macro at VDD=1.2V is 26ns. Compared to
previous SAs, the CSB-SA achieved 7× faster access time for 100nA ICELL on a
2048-cells BL. Figure 11.5.7 shows the die photo.

“Non-Volatile Memory and Normally-Off Computing:” 
A different sort of innovation in computing architecture based on non-volatile RAM is now 
advancing to enable further power reduction in addition to conventionally developed low-voltage 
technology. This new goal is to find a way to allow computing equipment to normally be turned off 
when not in use but be able to turn on instantly with full performance when needed. This is 
consistent with what we prefer to do in our daily life where there is an increasing interest to 
sustainable world. What is needed is a union of power control technology and 
information-communication technology. 
The key to achieving this is to ensure that any internal status of computation is memorized at any 
time before the power is turned off without consuming power. Non-volatile (NV) RAM is the 
critical component. NV RAM offers an infinite number of fast write and read operations as well as 
non-volatility. 
 
“Managing Increasing Complexity through Higher-level of Abstraction: What the past 
has taught us about the future” 
Time to market and design complexity challenges are well-known; we’ve all seen the statistics and 
predictions. A well-defined strategy to address these challenges seems less clear. Design for 
manufacturability approaches that optimize transistor geometries, “variability aware” physical 
implementation tools and design reuse strategies abound. While each of these techniques 
contributes to the solution, they all miss the primary force of design evolution. Over the past 30 
years or so, it has been proven time and again that moving design abstraction to the next higher 
level is required if design technology is to advance. In this keynote presentation, a new empirical 
model named Bose-Hackworth model will presented, examples of past trends will be identified, 
and an assessment will be made on what these trends mean in the context of the current challenges 
before us. A snapshot of the future will be presented which will contain some non-intuitive 
predictions. 
 
“Robust Systems: from Clouds to Nanotubes” 
Today’s mainstream electronic systems typically assume that transistors and interconnects operate 
correctly over their useful lifetime. With enormous complexity and significantly increased 
vulnerability to failures compared to the past, future system designs cannot rely on such 
assumptions. At the same time, there is explosive growth in our dependency on such systems. For 
example, in 2009, a glitch in a single circuit board of the air-traffic control system resulted in 
hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed. Robust system design is essential to ensure that 
future systems perform correctly despite rising complexity and increasing disturbances. For coming 
generations of silicon technologies, several causes of hardware failures, largely benign in the past, 
are becoming significant at the system-level. Furthermore, emerging nanotechnologies such as 
carbon nanotubes are inherently highly subject to imperfections. With extreme miniaturization of 
circuits, factors such as transient errors, device degradation, and variability induced by 
manufacturing and operating conditions are becoming important. While design margins are being 
squeezed to achieve high energy efficiency, expanded design margins are required to cope with 
variability and transistor aging. Even if error rates stay constant on a per-bit basis, total chip-level 
error rates grow with the scale of integration. Moreover, difficulties with traditional burn-in can 
leave early-life failures unscreened.

Circuit Design Challenges in Embedded Memory and Resistive RAM
(RRAM) for Mobile SoC and 3D-IC
Abstract - Mobile systems require high-performance and 
low-power SoC or 3D-IC chips to perform complex operations, 
ensure a small form-factor and ensure a long battery life time. A
low supply voltage (VDD) is frequently utilized to suppress 
dynamic power consumption, standby current, and thermal 
effects in SoC and 3D-IC. Furthermore, lowering the VDD 
reduces the voltage stress of the devices and slows the aging of 
chips. However, a low VDD for embedded memories can cause 
functional failure and low yield. This paper reviews various 
challenges in the design of low-voltage circuits for embedded 
memory (SRAM and ROM). It also discusses emerging 
embedded memory solutions. Alternative memory interfaces and 
architectures for mobile SoC and 3D-IC are also explored.
Introduction
The most important characteristics of a battery-powered 
mobile system are high performance, low power consumption 
and small form factor. To achieve small form factors, 
system-on-a-chip (SoC) and three-dimensional die-stacking 
(3D-IC) approaches are adopted instead of a conventional 
multiple-chip solution. 
Figure 1 compares the performance of volatile, nonvolatile 
and emerging memories. Mobile systems use nonvolatile 
memory (NVM) to provide storage for programs and data in 
the power-off mode. The most commonly used NVM are 
embedded Flash [1] and logic-ROMs [2]-[6]. Smart use of the 
power-off mode can reduce the system standby current. 
Except in logic-ROMs, NVM typically has a low read-write 
speed. Therefore, volatile memories (SRAM and DRAM) are 
frequently embedded in system-on-a-chip (SoC) or 3D-IC 
devices to achieve high-speed operations.
To ensure low power consumption and thus long battery life 
time, mobile systems require both a low dynamic power 
consumption and a low active-mode standby current. 
Numerous portable chips employ dynamic-voltage-scaling 
(DVS) schemes [7], [8] or a low supply voltage (VDD) to 
reduce power consumption. These methods reduce both 
dynamic power and active-mode leakage current, especially in 
ultra-low-power systems and health/biomedical applications 
[9]-[11]. Figure 2 presents an example of dynamic power 
reduction by using a lower VDD for a 90nm SRAM macro.
In 3D-IC, the thermal effect is one of the bottlenecks in 
reducing system standby power. Figure 3 displays the 
measured leakage current of a 512Kb SRAM macro at three 
operating temperatures. Increasing the operating temperature 
from its lowest value to its highest increases the SRAM 
leakage current by a factor of more than 150x. To suppress the 
thermal effect and power consumption in a 3D-IC, the VDD 
must be reduced.
Low minimum-operation-VDD (VDDmin) memory macros 
are needed in DVS and low-voltage devices. Unfortunately, 
many embedded memories cannot achieve low VDDmin 
because of read or write failure. Consequently, memories have 
become one of the bottlenecks to reducing the VDDmin of

bump at Q, associated with VTH variation, may cause data 
flipping in an SRAM cell during a read or dummy-read 
operation. This flipping raises an issue concerning the read 
stability or half-select stability for SRAM. Unfortunately, the 
cell stability, in terms of the static-noise-margin (SNM) 
[29]-[31], is worsened as the VDD decreases, as displayed in 
Fig. 6. The read and half-selection disturbances prevent the 
operation of SRAM at low VDD. Additionally, when the VDD 
is reduced, the SRAM cells also suffer from write failure 
because the write margin is reduced. Therefore, the on-chip 
SRAM is one of the bottlenecks in reducing the VDD (in OR 
of) a mobile SoC or 3D-IC.
B. Mask-programmable ROM
Embedded read-only-memory (ROM) provides a 
cost-effective and reliable solution for storing mature 
programs and data, which do not require code-changing after 
manufacture, because of its small macro area, high reliability 
(data-retention time), and pure logic process that does not 
require the use of high-voltage (HV) devices. The two popular 
embedded mask-programmed read-only memories (ROM) for 
nanometer process nodes are NOR-ROM and NAND-ROM.
NOR-type logic-ROMs [2]-[4] commonly adopted in 
high-speed, small-capacity applications. The
metal-programmable NAND-ROM [5], [6] has a smaller cell 
area, lower power consumption, and small standby current
than NOR-type ROMs.
As mentioned above, in column-multiplexing 
voltage-sensing memories, a wordline (WL) activates all 
bitcells on the same row, and only those bitcells on the 
selected BLs are read out. Hence, voltage swings occur in 
both the selected (selected reading) and unselected (unselected 
or half-selected reading) BLs that access 0-cells in the 
data-sensing phase. In voltage-sensing, the voltage drops on 
the unselected BLs (BL[n+1]/BL[n-1]) produce coupling 
noise, VBL-XT, on the selected BL (BL[n]). The BL crosstalk
from neighboring BLs detrimentally affects the selected BLs,
as shown in Fig. 7.
The charge-sharing effect and bitline leakage current also 
produce read-1 noise: The combined false voltage drop 
(VBL1-NOISE) that is caused by these read noises influences the 
sensing behavior of eNVMs. A small VBL1-NOISE reduces the 
effective VSM1. A large VBL1-NOISE (exceeding VSM1) causes 
sensing failure in the reading of a 1-cell. Unfortunately, 
VBL1-NOISE depends on data [2]-[6] and is worse at a lower 
VDD. Accordingly, choosing an appropriate VREF or
trigger-point for voltage-mode sense amplifiers that are 
operated at both nominal and low VDD is difficult. An 
ultra-low VREF is required to tolerate the VBL1-NOISE. A low VREF
requires a long TBL to tolerate a small ICELL of 0-cells because 
of data-pattern and process variations, creating a large speed 
penalty for eNVMs. Figure 8 reveals that an ultra-long TBL
does not increase VBL0-BL1, because of the BL leakage current. 
However, eNVMs can use a medium VREF and shorter TBL to
improve read speed at the expense of the data-pattern 
coverage rate.
III. Emerging Memories
A. Overview
High-performance mobile devices require fast access to
embedded NVM. The promising next generation of NVMs 
includes PCRAM, MRAM, CBRAM, FeRAM, and RRAM.
These designs have higher operating speeds than conventional 
eFlash devices. PCRAM has a shorter write time than eFlash,
but the write time is still 50ns~300ns owing to the long 
quenching times; PCRAM also has a large write power
consumption. PRAM requires extra circuitry for writing, such 
as that of a current cell regulator or multiple SET pulse 
generators [13], to provide a high resistance ratio for high 
yield sensing. MRAM has a high write speed (10ns~30ns) and 
excellent endurance, but suffers from the need for a limited 
R-ratio to ensure favorable sensing yield. RRAM is also a
promising candidate next-generation universal memory
because of its shorter write time, large R-ratio, multilevel 
capability, and relatively low write power consumption.
However, the switching mechanism of RRAM remains unclear.

stacking of DDR-interface DRAM dies significantly reduces 
the power consumed in processor-memory communication 
compared to that using conventional on-board (off-chip)
DRAM DIMM module.
Unlike the CMD-based approach, the use of an 
“embedded-memory-interface (EMI)” with additional
3D-dedicated pins can fully exploit the advantages of 
TSV-based 3D connection technologies, as shown in Fig. 12. 
The EMI-based approach enables a 3D-IC system to use 
wide-IO parallel data communication at a lower cycle speed 
than can be achieved using the DDR-based serial limited-IO 
high-speed communication between logic/processor and 
memory dies, for a target data bandwidth. Therefore, 
EMI-based processor–memory stacking can increase yield and 
reduce power consumption by eliminating the need for 
complex high-speed IO-interface circuitry.
B. New Memory Structure – Nonvolatile SRAM
Integrating emerging memories in a 3D-IC system with a 
new memory structure may significantly improve system 
performance, especially for mobile devices.
The speeds and VDDmin differences between SRAM and 
nonvolatile memories (NVMs), as displayed in Fig. 1, have 
led to the use of two-macro approach in many DVS mobile 
chips, instead of using a single slow-speed Flash macro. The
two-macro approach reduces the number of NVM access and 
relaxes the endurance requirements for NVM. However, the 
two-macro approach requires a long store time owing to the 
word-by-word (serial) SRAM read and long eNVM write 
procedures
Figure 14 shows several reported nonvolatile-SRAM 
(nvSRAM). These nonvolatile-SRAMs provide a faster 
store/restore speed than the two-macro approach for mobile 
chips, owing to their bit-to-bit parallel data storage. The 
SONOS-12T cell [40] requires a high store-voltage, has a long 
single-bit store-time (TSTORE), and a large area. The 
MRAM-19T2R latch [41] consumes a large store-current 
(ISTORE) and occupies a large area. The Fe-capacitor-6T2C cell

1. An offset tolerant current-sampling-based sense amplifier for sub-100nA-cell- current 
nonvolatile memory 
Decreasing read cell current (ICELL) has become a key trend in nonvolatile memory (NVM). This is 
not only due to device size and VDD scaling while keeping the same threshold voltage (VTH), but 
also to the growing spread of the following applications: 1) multiple-level-cell (MLC) [1-2] to 
achieve smaller area-per-bit; 2) lower-VDD [3] to save power consumption; 3) 
Logic-process-compatible one-time programming memories (OTP) for embedding into mobile 
chips. A smaller ICELL leaves the sense amplifiers (SAs) operation vulnerable to 1) bitline (BL) 
level offset due to noise, bias and load (CBL) mismatches and 2) VTH variation. As device size and 
BL-pitch is continually scaled down, the above factors have become major showstopper for SAs. 
To tolerate these offsets, small-ICELL NVMs suffer from slow read speed or high read fail 
probability. Thus, a more largely offset tolerant SA is a prerequisite to achieve faster read speeds. 
In this study, we propose a new offset tolerant current-sampling-based SA (CSB-SA) to achieve 7x 
faster read speed than previous SAs for sensing small ICELL. A fabricated 90nm 512Kb OTP macro, 
using the CSB-SA and our CMOS-logic-compatible OTP cell [4], achieves 26ns macro random 
access time for reading sub-200nA ICELL. Measurements also confirmed that this 90nm CSB-SA 
could achieve sub-100nA sensing.

Everywhere, from home appliances to space shuttles, such industrial growth has made human life
more productive and convenient. However, it has also created unprecedented levels of pollution,

4. Evening Session: ES3: Future System and Memory architectures: Transformations by 
Technology and applications 
 
The emergence of new enabling technologies and applications paradigms will likely drive radical
changes in the memory architecture of future systems. With multi-core CPU dies sporting 
embedded DRAM caches, ever-improving NAND flash storage densities for SSD and SCM, and 
3D-integration technologies to bring everything together into a single package, possibilities abound 
for system enhancements throughout the memory hierarchy. At the same time, applications needs 
are rapidly evolving as the world shifts from a product-centric economy to a service- and 
experience-oriented economy focused on hardware such as smartphones, set-top boxes, and 3D 
digital TV. This evening session will discuss future system and memory architectures from 
perspectives spanning the 3 C’s: computing, consumer electronics, and communications –
considering both what new technology might offer and what new applications might need.

Several emerging nonvolatile memories (NVMs) including phase-change RAM
(PCRAM) [1-3], MRAM [4-5], and resistive RAM (RRAM) [6-8] have achieved
faster operating speeds than embedded Flash. Among those emerging NVMs,
RRAM has advantages in faster write time, a larger resistance-ratio (R-ratio),
and smaller write power consumption. However, RRAM cells have large cross-
die and within-die resistance variations (R-variations) and require low read-
mode bitline (BL) bias voltage (VBL-R) to prevent read disturbance. This work
proposes process/resistance variation-insensitive read schemes for embedded
RRAM to achieve fast read speeds with high yields. An embedded mega-bit scale
(4Mb), single-level-cell (SLC) RRAM macro with sub-8ns read-write random-
access time is presented. Multi-level-cell (MLC) operation with 160ns write-ver-
ify operation is demonstrated.
Figure 11.2.1 shows the characteristic of the 1T1R RRAM cell, which consists of
an NMOS switch transistor and an HfO2-based bipolar resistive memory device
[8]. The RRAM is capable of two direct overwrite operations: SET (write-0) and
RESET (write-1). The SET operation changes the RRAM from a high-resistive
state (HRS) to a low-resistive state (LRS), by applying a SET-voltage (VSET) to
the BL and 0V to the source line (SL). The RESET operation changes the RRAM
from having a low resistance (RL, LRS) to having a high resistance (RH, HRS) by
applying a RESET voltage (VRESET) to the SL, and 0V to the BL. The mean R-ratio
(RH/RL) of our RRAM exceeds 100. The write operation consumes a small cur-
rent (<25µA) and a fast 0.3ns switch time. However, the VBL-R cannot exceed
0.3V for read disturbance consideration.
Current sensing (CS) [2-6] is commonly used in NVMs to achieve a faster read
speed than conventional voltage sensing (VS) [7] for NVMs, especially for long
BL and small read cell current (ICELL) memories. The CS scheme requires a ref-
erence-current (IREF) to compare with the to-be-sensed ICELL. To achieve good
process-voltage-temperature (PVT) tracking of ICELL, many NVMs use reference
cells [4-6] to generate the required IREF. However, RRAM devices have large
cross-die and within-die R-variations. R-variations occurring on reference-cells
[4] cause wide IREF distribution and low sensing yield for conventional single-cell
[3], parallel-cells or RH-RL-average reference-cell schemes [4-6], especially for
the large R-ratio RRAM. A dynamic BL-bias scheme achieves better VBL-R accu-
racy [6] with a faster settling time than a static BL-bias scheme. When VBL-R has
large fluctuations due to process and temperature variations, RRAM suffers read
disturbance. Figure 11.2.2 shows our read schemes and RRAM R-variation
effects. To achieve high read speeds, this macro uses differential-input-current
sensing with a dynamic VBL-R bias. A parallel-series reference-cell (PSRC)
scheme narrows the IREF distribution against R-variation. Also, this work devel-
ops a process-temperature-aware dynamic BL-bias circuit (PTADB) to achieve a
fast BL precharge with small VBL-R fluctuations for read disturbance considera-
tion.
Figure 11.2.3 shows the PSRC scheme. Each PSRC unit consists of p serial-con-
nected sub-reference-blocks (SRBs). Each SRB has q parallel-connected refer-
ence-cells. Unlike using both LRS and HRS cells in previous reference-cell
schemes [4-6], this work uses LRS cells only as the reference cells for SLC
operations. It is because the LRS cells dominated the IREF generation when R-
ratio is large. Moreover, the within-die R-variation range of RL is 10× smaller
than RH for our RRAM. The PSRC scheme prevents the IREF generation from
being dominated by one ultra-low resistance LRS cell (a tail-bit). Though the
series-parallel [5] scheme can generate the mid-point resistance, its IREF derived
from the mid-point resistance does not yield the mid-point current of two neigh-
boring MLC states. From the statistical analysis, the PSRC scheme narrows the
SLC IREF distribution and reduces the σ-IREF by 35 to 80% compared to previous
schemes. For MLC operation, the PSRC achieves a 99% smaller mean-IREF devi-
ation from the mid-point current compared to the series-parallel approach. Thus,
the PSRC scheme is suitable for both SLC and MLC RRAMs against R-variation.
Figure 11.2.4 shows the PTADB scheme, which consists of a process-tempera-
ture detector (PTD) and a process- temperature compensated feedback amplifi-
er (PTFA). The PTD circuit compares the PMOS-NMOS transistor strength
across various process corners and operating temperatures, then generates a k-
bit code. The PTFA, a common-source amplifier (P1) with a current bias (N1),
receives the k-bit code from the PTD to adjust its output voltage (VCLP) for con-
trolling the BL-clamping NMOS transistor (NCLP). Unlike the conventional
scheme of using a fixed current bias for the VCLP generation, the PTFA uses a
dynamic current-bias for N1 to enlarge VCLP swing ranges for accelerating the
BL precharge and clamping operation. Compared to conventional dynamic BL-
bias schemes [6] the PTFA reduces 50% VBL-R variation across global process
corners and achieves a 24% faster read access time.
An RRAM testchip, with a 4Mb RRAM macro and test-mode circuits, is fabricat-
ed using an HfO2-based RRAM device and a 0.18µm CMOS logic process. The
testchip access time (TAC-CHIP) includes the access time of the embedded RRAM
macro (TAC) and the path delay time (TP-DELAY,). The TP-DELAY consists of the
delay times of on-chip and load-board wirings. A dummy path is implemented
to measure TP-DELAY for extracting the TAC. Figure 11.2.5 shows the measured
IREF distribution and read access time. The PSRC scheme has a narrower IREF
distribution than the single-cell IREF scheme, with a 44% reduction in σ-IREF.
Since the RRAM device has fast write speed, the read-write access time is dom-
inated by the read operation. The measured random-access and burst-read TAC
of the 4Mb RRAM macro is 7.2ns and 3.6ns, respectively. Figure 11.2.6 shows
the measured SLC and MLC results. The read circuits are functional from 1.8V
to 700mV and detect a wide-range of ICELL variation, across a wide range of WL
voltage. These tests confirm that our read circuit shows good resistance-track-
ing capability and is scalable for a lower VDD. The MLC write-verify procedure is
presented. The Level-2~Level-4 writings are the SET operations but with differ-
ent WL voltages. This RRAM achieves 2b/cell MLC operation with 160ns random
access time. Figure 11.2.7 shows the die micrograph.

Eliminating a Need for Additional Sensing Tolerance Margins. 
 
A method for direct measurements of bit-line (BL) swing, sense amplifier (SA) offset and 
word-line (WL) pulse width is demonstrated in a 40nm CMOS 32kb fully functional SRAM macro 
with <2% area penalty. This allows, for the first time, deciding the best tuning option for WL-pulse 
(WLP) width based on the results being measured on site for BL swing and dynamic read/write 
stability (DRWS), which both depend on WLP width. It has enabled to eliminate a need of 
additional margin for BL swing, which was conventionally needed for ensuring tolerance against 
its simulation errors and inaccurate SA-offset estimation. As a result, it was found that more 
aggressive option for WLP width could be chosen while ensuring the target BL swing.

This work demonstrates the first fabricated TSV-based die-to-die bonding 
stacked-layer-number-scalable 3D-SRAM macro. This 3D-SRAM uses a semi-master-slave (SMS) 
structure and a self-timed differential-TSV signal transfer (STDT) scheme to 1) provide a 
constant-load logic-SRAM interface across various layer configurations; 2) suppress TSV-induced 
power and speed overheads; 3) tolerate die-to-die variation, and 4) enable pre-bonding KGD 
sorting, to improve the speed and yield of universal-memory-capacity platforms. Superior 
scalability of increasing stacked layer number with small speed overheads is demonstrated in the 
fabricated 3D-SRAM macro with layer-scalable test-modes. This macro has two SRAM layers that 
are stacked by a via-last process with die-to-die bonding.

By W. J. Dally, NVIDIA and Stanford Univ., USA 
 
Future computing systems from application processors in mobile devices to high-end 
supercomputers face fundamental challenges of power, bandwidth, and synchronization. The 
power dissipation of these systems will be dominated by communication and clocking. Bandwidth, 
both on-chip, and off-chip will be a major limit to system performance. Conventional synchronous 
systems will become increasingly costly in terms of both cycle-time overhead and energy. A 
combination of novel architecture and efficient circuits can help meet these challenges. This talk 
will discuss the challenges of power, bandwidth, and synchronization in more detail and present 
some potential solutions for each challenge.

Abstract 
A method for direct measurements of bit-line (BL) swing, 
sense amplifier (SA) offset and word-line (WL) pulse width 
is demonstrated in a 40nm CMOS 32kb fully functional 
SRAM macro with <2% area penalty. This allows, for the 
first time, deciding the best tuning option for WL-pulse 
(WLP) width based on the results being measured on site for 
BL swing and dynamic read/write stability (DRWS), which  
both depend on WLP width. It has enabled to eliminate a 
need of additional margin for BL swing, which was 
conventionally needed for ensuring tolerance against its 
simulation errors and inaccurate SA-offset estimation.  As a 
result, it was found that more aggressive option for WLP 
width could be chosen while ensuring the target BL swing. 
Introduction 
Since SRAM compiler design uses BL voltage sensing SA 
and its BL swing depends on the WLP width, which can also 
give a significant impact on DRWS, it is very crucial for the 
designer to decide WLP tuning option.  Getting more serious 
issues of process variability is making the WLP trade-off 
design more difficult. Based on the background above, 
several methods for direct measurements of cell current 
(ICELL) [1], DRWS, and WLP width were proposed [2-4] in 
dedicated test structures and well discussed the statistical 
bit-cell characterization. These measured data can be 
utilized for backannotation data while performing the 
corrections of original SPICE model parameters. However, 
measured dynamic SA offset, BL swing, BL leakage, 
BL-RC-delay (including Ron and C of Y-MUX), are still not 
well-given to the designers who have to decide the WLP 
option in fully functional SRAM macro. As a result, the 
excess margins for WLP width and BL swing are needed for 
ensuring tolerance against its estimation errors in the fail 
probabilities of the SA sensing and DRWS.   
In order to fulfill the longtime earnest wish of designers, a 
method for direct measurements of the BL swing, the SA 
offset and the WLP width while also measuring DRWS is 
proposed.  
The key concepts of proposed ideas (shown in Fig.1) are: 
1)  directly measuring of the impact of WLP tuning option 
on: a) BL swing, b) SA-offset, c) WLP width, d) DRWS,  
2) using for compilable fully functional SRAM macro (no 
need of area consuming dedicated test structure unlike the 
conventional one [2-4]). As shown in Fig.1, the designer can 
choose the best WLP width tuning option while confirming 
the BL swing and DRWS unlike the conventional designs 
which requires repeated backannotation trials based on the 
limited data for WLP, ICELL, and other estimating design 
parameters in SPICE, resulting in need of excess margins for 
ensuring tolerance against its estimating errors. 
Fig. 2 shows the block diagram of the proposed fully 
functional SRAM macro with test structure, which allows 
measuring of BL-swing (Vdiff), WLP width, BL-leakage, 
Icell, and DRWS.  In this paper, due to limitation of space, 
detailed explanations are focused on just three techniques 
for measuring: 1) SA-offset, 2) BL/BLB-swing, and 3) WLP 
width. The similar schemes proposed in [1-4] were used in 
this design to measure DRWS and ICELL.  
Direct SA Offset Detection (DSAD) Scheme 
A switch control of (SW1-4) and waveforms for DSAD 
scheme are shown in Fig.3. The external controlled 
differential signals M_DL/DLB are forced into the SA and 
swept until SA offset (˂Vsa) can be detected, i.e., until 
SA-Q flips as shown in Fig.3. 
Direct BL Swing Sensing (DBLS) Scheme 
In a functional read operation, the potential difference 
(Vdiff) between BL(DL) and BLB(DLB) is given by 1) ICELL 
discharging (˂Vrd), 2) BL leak discharging (˂Vlk), and 3) 
BL inter/intra coupling noises (˂Vcp).   
That is,   Vdiff = ˂Vrd – ˂Vlk – ˂Vcp.  
In this scheme, to measure each factor separately, only 
target DL(DLB) is connected with BL(BLB) while the other 
DLB(DL) is forced with M_DLB(M_DL) while 
disconnecting BLB(BL) by Y-MUX.    The given SA offset 
˂ Vsa by DSAD measurement is considered when 
measuring ˂Vrd, ˂Vlk, and ˂Vcp. ICELL and DRWS can 
also be measured in this scheme. 
WLP Width Measurement Scheme 
 The mechanism for WLP width measurement consists of 
the following two steps: 1) to make the loop path of ring 
oscillator (RO-path) by using the actual logic path of WLP 
generator, while making the total RO-path delay time the 
equal of the actual WLP width as shown in Fig.4, and 2) to 
measure 1/N- divided frequency f of RO. The WLP width is 
given by 1/(2fN). The impact of the RO jitter can also be 
mitigated by averaging the frequency detection. 
Measurement Results and Conclusion 
A 32kb SRAM macro was fabricated in TSMC 40nm LP 
CMOS process, whose die photo is shown in Fig.5, which 
embeds the test structure with <2% area penalty.  
The measured WLP width versus BL swing (Vdiff) is 
shown in Fig. 6 so that well-controlled Vdiff by WLP option 
can be verified. Fig. 7 shows the measured SA offset versus 
Vdiff. The gap of Vdiff and SA offset corresponds to the 
margins. Two cases of ICELL versus Vdiff with and without 
significant discrepancy between measured and simulated 
ICELL are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 to verify how important to 
get the measured Vdiff unlike only ICELL.  Each figure 
includes the three cases of 1) measured data, 2) simulation 
(˰ICELL), and 3) simulation (˰Cbl, ˰Y-MUX, ˰ICELL), and 
compares the impact of each estimation on the discrepancy 
with the measured data.  It is verified, for the first time, that 
whole measurement of BL swing, SA offset, and WLP width 
while monitoring DRWS on site allows for the designer to 
choose more aggressive option (about 10% in this case) for 
WLP width than that for the conventional decision.

Abstract 
This work demonstrates the first fabricated TSV-based 
die-to-die bonding stacked-layer-number-scalable 3D-SRAM 
macro. This 3D-SRAM uses a semi-master-slave (SMS) 
structure and a self-timed differential-TSV signal transfer 
(STDT) scheme to 1) provide a constant-load logic-SRAM 
interface across various layer configurations; 2) suppress 
TSV-induced power and speed overheads; 3) tolerate 
die-to-die variation, and 4) enable pre-bonding KGD sorting, 
to improve the speed and yield of universal-memory-capacity 
platforms. Superior scalability of increasing stacked layer 
number with small speed overheads is demonstrated in the 
fabricated 3D-SRAM macro with layer-scalable test-modes. 
This macro has two SRAM layers that are stacked by a via-last 
process with die-to-die bonding.  
Introduction 
 Through-silicon-via (TSV) is a promising 3D die-stacking 
solution because of its potential for realizing a large bandwidth, 
small form factor, and less limitations on the maximum 
number of stacked layers (NSTACK) [1-2]. TSV technology 
provides a universal-memory-capacity (UMC) platform, 
enabling a pre-designed logic die and different numbers of 
stacked memory layers to be used to satisfy various system 
requirements at lower costs and with a shorter time-to-market 
than 2D specific-memory-capacity SoC methods. 
Currently, TSV has a huge size and cannot fit into the small 
SRAM rows/columns pitch as required in novel conceptual 
3D-SRAMs [3-5]. The via-last process is a popular TSV 
approach because it is simpler than the via-first/middle process 
and provides a higher-yield die-to-die/wafer bonding [6] than 
the wafer-to-wafer bonding 3D-via approach [7].  However, 
the via-last process has the drawback of a larger parasitic load 
(~300fF/TSV) [1]. As shown in Fig.1, since the TSVs across 
layers are shorted in stacked dies using the same mask for both 
non-buffered via-first/middle and via-last processes, the 
parasitic load of a vertical signal is sensitive to NSTACK and TSV 
mismatch. Large-NSTACK designs generate large TSV-load and 
mismatch, resulting in a increasing cross-layer TSV signal 
delay and skew (Fig. 2) and increasing power consumption in 
TSV toggling in high-speed wide-bandwidth designs. Also, 
the TSV-load fluctuation causes variations in set-up time on 
the logic-SRAM interface. Thus, the conventional 
direct-stacking (DS) structure (Fig. 3) has difficulty in 
supporting large NSTACK for high-speed UMC platforms, owing 
to the TSV-induced overheads. 
To make the TSV-based 3D-SRAM much more scalable in 
terms of number of stacked layers, 1) a semi-master-slave 
(SMS) structure and 2) a self-timed differential-TSV signal 
transfer (STDT) scheme are, for the first time, proposed and a 
TSV-based scalable-capacity 3D-SRAM with two SRAM 
layers (die-to-die bonded) is fabricated. This enables 
comparisons of pros and cons with such alternatives as the 
3D-SRAM with inductor-coupling and wire-bonding [8]. 
High Layer-Scalability 3D-SRAM  
A. Semi-Master-Slave (SMS) Structure 
    The master-slave (MS) structure [1] achieves a constant RC 
loading logic-memory interface for various NSTACK by using a 
buffered interface. However, in MS, the central-timing scheme 
leads to less tolerance of die-to-die (D2D) variation across 
slave layers, because slave layers comprise only cell arrays and 
share the same control timings that are generated in the master 
layer. To perform pre-bonding known-good-die (KGD) 
sorting, each MS slave-layer needs extra test logics [3]. 
On the other hand, the SMS structure uses the same 
buffered-interface scheme as is used in MS to achieve a 
constant-load logic-SRAM interface, but each slave-layer has 
its own local timer and bias settings, as in DS, to tolerate D2D 
variation and perform pre-bonding KGD sorting, thus 
increasing the yield. Thanks to having both the main 
advantages of both DS and MS structures (Table I), the SMS 
scheme achieves higher layer scalability with better yield. 
B. Self-Timed Differential-TSV Signal Transfer (STDT) 
Scheme 
To suppress the speed and power overheads caused by the 
large TSV load even as NSTACK is increased, a 
small-voltage-swing STDT scheme is used for cross-layer 
global signal communication in SMS, as Fig. 4 shows. The 
STDT scheme consists of TSV-transmitters (T-TX), 
TSV-receivers (T-RX), and TSV-timers. Two TSVs are used 
to make a signal transmission in STDT differential manner.  A 
TSV-timer is used for each group of signals to control T-RXs 
and T-TXs. Each TSV-timer has 1) dummy T-TXs (DT-TX), 
2) a dummy TSV path (DTP), 3) a TSV voltage detector 
(T-VD), 4) a T-RX enable signal (T-RXEN), and 5) a T-TX 
disable signal (T-TXOFF).  
For example, when the selected slave layer transmits its local 
read data to the master layer, both regular T-TXs and the 
DT-TX of the selected slave-layer drive the regular TSV pairs 
and DTP. Since the driver strength of DT-TX is k times that of 
T-TX, the voltage swing on the DTP (VDTP) becomes k times 
that of T-TX for a given T-TX/DT-TX enabling period. If the 
trigger point for a T-VD is properly designed, then the 
TSV-timer can track the typical voltage of TSV (VTSV) and 
generate the required timing (T-RXEN) to enable the T-RX in 
the master layer to sense the TSV signal. Additionally, the 
TSV-timer sends out the T-TXOFF to disable the T-TXs to 
limit VTSV swing.  This TSV-tracking provides effective PVT 
tracking of the T-TXs and the TSV load of SMS 3D-SRAM 
across various NSTACK.
