1. Introduction 
In metal industry, plastic deformation processes are the most commonly used techniques in 
manufacturing.  Following the coming age of mass production and merchandized market, the 
goals of industry are to validate the deformation theory of materials, to find the controlling 
factors of material deformation, to ensure the mechanical properties of materials, to explore the 
most efficient ways of production, and to manufacture the stable qualities of merchandises. 
Contemporary theory of metallic plastic deformation mechanism at low homologous 
temperatures (less than one-half the melting temperature) is attributed to the physical processes of 
dislocations passing obstacles.  Nearly a century ago, Becker [1] and Orowan [2] pointed out 
that the energy needed to overcome obstacle barriers is provided not only by the resolved shear 
stress but also thermal energy, so that thermally activated deformation theory [3–6] is named 
accordingly.  However, Alden [7–9] proposed that besides the resolved shear stress and the 
thermal energy, the applied shear stress rate should also be included in the analysis of overcoming 
obstacle barriers, so that mechanically activated deformation theory [7–9] is termed 
correspondingly. 
Several experimental methods on the applied stress rate have been proposed to test the 
validity of both theories, load relaxation test [8,10–12], stress rate change test during creep 
experiment [13–15], and stress rate change test using servohydraulic dynamic material testing 
system [16–18].  In load relaxation test, strain rate change could not be detected because of 
small stress rate, low equipment resolution, and slow data acquisition time [10,11,19].  However, 
abrupt strain rate change due to stress rate change test using both creep and servohydraulic 
systems could be recorded [13–18].  Hence, Alden [13–15] claimed that the strain rate 
discontinuity be the evidence of mechanically activated deformation theory.  However, by using 
the concept of fluid dynamics, thermally activated kinetic flow theory with structural evolution 
law, and numerical methods, Kuo et al. [6] could simulate the very abrupt changes in strain rate 
that occur without invoking mechanically activation theory.  Consequent experimental work and 
numerical modeling [16–18] indicate that thermally activated deformation mechanism of metallic 
plastic deformation is adequately enough. 
Pure copper has been studied extensively in the stress rate change test during past 20 years.  
However, within FCC metals, pure aluminum is an easily acquired material.  In this study, stress 
rate change test on pure aluminum 1070 is also conducted by MTS servohydraulic load frame 
with MTS TestStar II controller.  Thermally activated deformation theory that consists of both 
flow kinetics and structural evolution law are the governing equations to describe the physical 
process of plastic deformation.  Incremental method and forward difference scheme for the 
coupled nonlinear system of equations are employed in the numerical simulation.  Excellent 
agreement is observed in the comparison between experimental data and numerical calculations, 
especially on the very abrupt change in strain rate at the stress rate change point.  Sensitivity 
analyses are also performed to better understand both flow kinetics and structural evolution law. 
2. Thermally activated deformation mechanism 
For metals at low homologous temperatures, the physical processes involved in plastic 
of plastic deformation, so that the time dependent strain hardening rate is expressed as 
βγαµτ 2/)/ˆ( P&=+dtd [5,18].  For FCC metals, 90/ =αβ  [8], so that 180/)/ˆ( Pγµτ &=+dtd . 
Dynamic recovery is associated with dislocation loss process.  The recovery of dislocation 
networks could be described by an effective recovery length RL  of opposite sign dislocations as 
schematically shown in Fig. 2.  By the statistical nature of dislocation annihilation, the time 
dependent dynamic recovery rate is expressed as bLdtd 2/ˆ)/ˆ( PRγττ &−=− [5,18]. 
For FCC metals, structural evolution law could be written as [5,18]

where RL  is the only parameter to be determined experimentally.  Plastic deformation of pure 
aluminum is described by the coupling way of both kinetic flow theory Eq. (2) at a fixed structure 
and structural evolution law Eq. (4) in the course of deformation. 
3. Experimental details 
Plate type pure aluminum 1070 (Al: 99.82 wt.%) with thickness 10 mm is chosen as the test 
material.  GDS/ICP composition analysis of test material is shown in Table 1.  According to the 
dimensions of ASTM E 8M–94a [20], standard sheet-type specimens with gage length 50 mm 
and width 12.5 mm were machined to the thickness of 7 mm, which complies to the flat wedge 
grip of material testing system.  Specimens were fully annealing for one hour at 618 K, 
subsequently furnace cooled.  After annealing, equal-axial grain structure is obtained with an 
averaged grain size 210 µm.  Polarized optical microscopic view of specimen is shown in Fig. 3. 
Standard tensile tests show Young’s modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and 
elongation rate are 59.95 GPa, 54.788 MPa, 76.52 MPa, and 51.38%, respectively.  A typical 
stress-strain curve conducted by standard tensile test is shown in Fig. 4. 
Stress rate change experiment was conducted at room temperature by using an MTS 318.10 
servohydraulic ±100 kN load frame, an MTS TestStar II 490 digital controller and an NT based 
personal computer running MTS 790.00 TestStar II system software & 790.10 TestWare-SX 
version 4.0D.  MTS 661.20-02 ±50 kN load cell is calibrated into four ranges, 10% (±5 kN), 
20% (±10 kN), 50% (±25 kN), and 100% (±50 kN) in order to achieve a better load resolution.  
MTS 632.25F-20 50 mm gage length axial extensometer is used for the strain measurement. 
In this research, long-range dislocation motion encounters short-range point obstacles, so that 
plastic deformation regime is the major concern.  All the stress levels should beyond yield 
strength.  Two stress rate change test schemes were employed.  As shown in Fig. 5, the first 
scheme requires that the final stress level ( fS ) be fixed and the duration of applied stress rate ( 1S& ) 
be 0.25 s.  Two different final stress levels ( fS ), 60 and 65 MPa are chosen, and three different 
applied stress rates ( 1S& ), namely, 5, 10, and 20 MPa/s are selected.  In the first scheme, the 
initial stress levels ( iS ) are then 58.75, 57.5, and 55 MPa for 60f =S  MPa as well as 63.75, 
62.5, and 60 MPa for 65=fS  MPa at ,51 =S&  10, and 20 MPa/s, respectively.  The second 
scheme shown in Fig. 6 asks that both the initial stress level ( iS ) and the final stress level ( fS ) be

Parameters in the numerical calculation could be found in Frost and Ashby [21]:

2.22=µ GPa, is calculated from Young’s modulus 59.95 GPa with the assumption that Poisson’s 
ratio 35.0=ν .  Shear stress function )(tτ  and time increment t∆  are imported from MTS 
data file.  Taylor factor, which is a conversion factor between normal stress and shear stress as 
well as normal strain and shear strain, is 3.1 [17].  A∆  and RL  are respectively 2500b2 and 
9.5b, which are obtained by trial and error from uniaxial tensile tests with different applied stress 
rates as shown in Fig. 7. 
Initial conditions are mostly obtained from experimental data.  In the numerical simulations, 
a starting point in the initial stress level iS  (usually after holding 2 s) is selected as 0=t ; initial 
conditions such as the applied shear stress )0(τ  and the plastic shear strain )0(Pγ  are obtained 
from MTS data file.  The initial plastic shear strain rate )0(Pγ&  is obtained from the average slope 
of 50 succession points after 0=t  of shear strain-time plot.  Initial obstacle strength )0(τˆ  is 
calculated based upon Eq. (2):

5. Results and discussions 
5.1. Comparison between numerical calculations and experimental data 
Time history plots of the first scheme for final stress level 60 MPa with three different stress 
rates 5, 10 and 20 MPa/s are shown in Figs. 8, 9 and 10, respectively.  Plots of the second 
scheme for stress level from 55 to 60 MPa are shown in Figs. 10, 11 and 12 for stress rates 20, 10, 
and 5 MPa/s, respectively.  Figs. 13, 14 and 15 are respectively the plots of the first scheme for 
final stress level 65 MPa with three different stress rates 5, 10 and 20 MPa/s.  Plots of the 
second scheme for stress level from 60 to 65 MPa are respectively shown in Figs. 15, 16 and 17 
for stress rates 20, 10, and 5 MPa/s. 
In the numerical simulation, A∆ , the area swept out by a dislocation in passing the obstacle, 
is assumed a constant value of 22500b  based upon the uniaxial constant stress rate test results.  
RL , an effective recovery length of dislocations, is very sensitive in the numerical calculation, so 
that the value is adjusted according to each experimental datum to have the best fit.  The 
averaged value is b7.9  with deviation within b6.0± .  Detail values are shown in Table 2.  
Essmann and Mughrabi [22] reported that the critical distance of annihilation of edge dislocation 
for copper is 1.6 nm or b26.6 .  However, the critical distance of annihilation of screw 
dislocation is reported [22] on the range of 50~500 nm.  Compared with the RL  value of pure 
copper, b2.10.8 ±  [18], it shows that the effective recovery length of dislocations is about the 
same order b10  for both pure copper and aluminum. 
Excellent agreement is observed between experimental data and numerical calculations, 
at stress raising period is more severe; on the other hand, for very low value of A∆ , strain rate is 
almost continuous. 
Based upon Eq. (2), the relationship between strain rate γ& and A∆  is a nonlinear 
exponential function.  Compared to RL , A∆  is very insensitive in the numerical calculation 
and could be in the range of 21500b  to 24500b , however, it controls the shape of the abrupt 
change in strain rate near the stress rate change point.  Simple kinetic model such as the 
regularly distributed rectangular obstacle is adequate enough.  There is no need for more 
complex model to describe the obstacle thermodynamics.  Similar results are also obtained for 
copper [18]. 
6. Conclusions 
In this study, stress rate change experiments on pure aluminum are conducted to test the 
validity of thermally activated deformation mechanism of pure metals, which consists of kinetic 
flow theory and structural evolution law.  These two governing equations are derived from 
physical processes of dislocation motion and its interaction with obstacles.  Incremental method 
and forward difference scheme for the coupled nonlinear system of equations are employed in the 
numerical simulation.  By small variation of dynamic recovery parameter RL , excellent 
agreement is observed in the comparison between experimental data and numerical calculations, 
especially on the very abrupt change in strain rate at the stress rate change point.  Sensitivity 
analyses are also performed to verify the area swept out by a dislocation in passing the obstacle 
A∆  and dislocation annihilation distance RL , which are key parameters in the kinetic flow 
theory and structural evolution law, respectively.  A∆  is very insensitive and could be in the 
range of 21500b  to 24500b , so that simple kinetic model such as the regularly distributed 
rectangular obstacle is adequate enough.  On the other hand, RL  is a very sensitive parameter 
and determines the obstacle structure during the course of deformation.  The averaged value of 
RL  is b7.9  that is in the same order as reported previously.  Constant obstacle structure seems 
impossible to maintain once the loading condition changes.
