Abstract 
In this project, a technique composed of supercritical fluid extraction and Rapid Expansion 
of Supercritical fluid Solutions is using to develop a fine particle in material. Supercritical fluid 
extraction method adjusts pressure, temperature and modifier to control the dissolution rate of 
extract and extracts the effective element in material. The Rapid Expansion of Supercritical fluid 
Solution System (RESS) method developed by this project will adjust the physical property of 
supercritical fluid to produce a fine particle and purify the particle.  
The second year of this project was established a fuzzy model of RESS and developed the 
application of a fine particle. This study performs a series of experimental investigations to 
determine the temperature and pressure conditions which maximize the quantities of caffeine and 
EGCG extracted from green tea using a supercritical fluid extraction process with a carbon 
dioxide solvent. The experimental data are then used to construct a fuzzy model for predicting the 
extract quantities given the temperature and pressure conditions of the extraction process. The 
average discrepancy between the experimental results and the predicted results for the quantities 
of caffeine and EGCG extracted at temperatures of 40°C, 50°C and 60°C, pressure 4500psi to 
1250psi respectively, thus confirming the viability of the fuzzy model as a predictive tool. Overall, 
the results reveal that a temperature of 40°C and a pressure of 2500 psi represent the optimum 
extraction conditions for both caffeine and EGCG. 
The manufacturing processes of this project can make paltry affect of environment and also 
keep the activation of material. By the way, these processes cannot need post-processes to obtain 
fine particles of heat impressible material. The techniques of fine particle manufacturing and 
purification will apply in bio-technique and medicine making etc.

Abstract—This paper studies the bifurcation behavior of the 
probe tip of an atomic force microscope with a 
proportional-plus-derivative (PD) feedback control using the 
DT (differential transformation) method. The dynamic behavior 
of the probe tip with PD control law is characterized by 
reference to maximum Lyapunov exponent plots produced 
using the time-series data obtained from differential 
transformation method. Furthermore, the detailed transitions 
in the dynamic response of the probe tip are examined using 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively. The results indicate that the probe tip 
behavior is significantly dependent on the magnitude of the 
proportional and derivative control gain. Specifically, the probe 
tip motion includes T-, 2T-, 3T-, 4T-, multi-periodic, and chaotic 
motion. Numerical results show that the dynamic behavior will 
leave chaotic motion to periodic motion at Kp=-0.45 in the 
steady state by changing the control loop gain Kv from -0.1 to 
-1.0. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the differential 
transformation method is in good agreement for the considered 
system. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE atomic force microscope (AFM) provides a powerful 
tool for surface analysis applications in the 
nano-electronics, materials and biotechnology fields. During 
operation, intermolecular forces between the AFM probe tip 
and the sample surface cause a deflection of the 
microcantilever on which the probe tip is mounted. The 
variation in force acting on the tip is then evaluated by using 
some form of optical technique to measure the deflection of 
the cantilever. 
The nonlinear dynamic behavior of an AFM system is a 
major concern since any irregular motion of the AFM probe 
tip inevitably degrades the precision of the measurement 
results. Burnham et al. [1], [2] showed that the

microcantilever of an AFM performed chaotic motion under 
specific physical conditions. Ashhab et al. [3] modeled the 
microcantilever of an AFM using a single-frequency mode 
approximation and analyzed the chaotic dynamics of the 
cantilever-sample system using the Melnikov method. Lee et 
al. [4] analyzed the effects of van der Waals and 
Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov forces on the tip-sample 
interactions induced in dynamic force microscopy (DFM). 
The authors also presented detailed experimental results 
which provided valuable new perspectives and insights into 
DFM. Ruetzel et al. [5] applied the Galerkin method to 
investigate the nonlinear dynamics of an AFM probe tip 
under the assumption that the tip-surface interactions were 
governed by Lennard-Jones potentials. Based upon their 
analysis, the authors showed that the probe tip exhibited a 
broad range of dynamic phenomena, including both periodic 
and chaotic motion. 
However, none of the studies reviewed above presented 
phase portraits, power spectra, Poincaré maps, maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots or bifurcation diagrams to confirm 
the validity of their predictions for the AFM behavior or use a 
PD (proportional-plus-derivative) feedback to control the 
chaotic motion observed in the AFM system. Accordingly, 
the present study investigates the dynamic behavior of an 
AFM probe tip using two numerical methods, namely the 
differential transformation method [6], [7] and the 
Runge-Kutta method and then characterizes the dynamic 
response of the system by reference to phase portraits, power 
spectra, Poincaré maps, and maximum Lyapunov exponent 
plots. Finally, the chaotic behavior in the AFM system is 
identified using bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement 
and tip velocity, respectively and a PD controller included 
proportional gain and derivative gain is applied to control this 
system.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents a mathematical model for the 
time-dependent motions of the microcantilever tip and 
describes the solution of this model using the differential 
transformation method. Section 3 compares and contrasts the 
numerical results obtained by the differential transformation 
method and the Runge-Kutta method for the dynamic 
response of the microcantilever tip at various proportional 
gains and derivative gains. Subsequently, the nonlinear 
dynamic behavior of the probe tip is analyzed by maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots and bifurcation diagrams, 
respectively. Finally, Section 4 draws some brief conclusions.

B. Situation 1 
In the first situation, the bifurcation parameter was chosen 
to be the Kp, and Kv=0. In the current study, Figs. 1 plot the 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively, taking Kp as the bifurcation parameter. 
Finally, Figs. 2(a)-2(f) present the maximum Lyapunov 
exponent of the microcantilever tip trajectory at Kp = -0.5, 
-0.47, -0.39, -0.32, -0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, respectively.  
Figs 1(a)(b) and 2(a) show that at lower values of Kp, i.e. Kp 
<-0.47, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip both 
exhibit a dynamic periodic response. As Kp is increased from 
-0.47 to -0.41, Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip 
displacement and the tip velocity perform chaotic motions. 
Fig. 2(b) presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp = 
-0.47 and proof the appearance of chaos. At Kp = -0.4, the 
chaotic motion is replaced by multi-subharmonic motion, as 
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). When Kp is increased over the 
interval -0.4≤Kp<-0.32, the tip response includes both 
multi-subharmonic and 4T-subharmonic motion. Fig. 2(c) 
presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp =-0.39(4T). 
However, at Kp =-0.32, the 4T-periodic motion is replaced by 
chaotic motion, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Thereafter, the chaotic 
motion changes its unstable state at Kp =-0.22 and is replaced 
by multi-subharmonic motion. In the range -0.22≤ Kp <0.1, 
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip displacement and 
the tip velocity perform 4 kinds of motions including T-, 3T-, 
4T-, and multi-subharmonic motions. Figs. 2(e)-2(h) present 
the maximum Lyapunov exponent corresponding to Kp = 
-0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, and the maps confirm the 
existence of multi-, 4T-, 3T-subharmonic and T-periodic 
behavior shown in the bifurcation diagrams.  
From the discussions above, it is clear that the dynamic 
response of the probe tip depends on the magnitude of Kp. The 
various motions performed by the tip as Kp increases from -2 
to 0.1 are summarized in Table 3.

D. Situation 3 
In order to analyze that the influence of both Kp and Kv, the 
case is restricted Kp ＜1 and Kv ＜A4 . Also, the PD feedback 
is used to control this system to avoid the chaotic motion 
appear. The bifurcation parameter was chosen to be the Kv at 
Kp =-0.45. 
Figs. 5(a)(b) and 6(a) show that at lower values of Kv, i.e. 
Kv <-0.1, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip 
both exhibit a dynamic periodic response. At Kv = -0.1, the 
T-periodic motion is replaced by chaotic motion, as shown in 
Figs. 5 and 6(b). When Kv is increased over the interval -0.1≤ 
Kv <0.13, the tip response is chaotic motion. Figs. 6(c) and 
6(d) present the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kv = 0 and 
0.02, respectively.

values of Kv : (a)-1.0, (b)-0.1, (c)0, and (d)0.02. 
 
It is known that if the tip of the AFM system operates in the 
state of aperiodic motion, the resulting broadband vibration 
with large amplitude will lead to a higher probability of 
fatigue failure of microcantilever and decrease the measure 
accuracy of the AFM system. At Kp =-0.45 and Kv =-0.1, the 
maximum Lyapunov exponent is positive and Poincaré map 
demonstrated a fractal structure. It shows that the trajectory of 
the tip displacement is in a state of chaos. In order to 
eliminate the system operating in a no synchronous motion, a 
decreased derivative gain Kv =-0.1 is applied to control this 
system. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the tip dynamics leave 
the disorder state and turns to a periodic motion in the steady 
state after the derivative gain changes from -0.1 to -1.0.

phones, television and satellite applications, therefore the 
Federal Communications Commission agreement states that 
two frequencies of 0.915 and 2.45GHz are specifically used for 
microwave heating in order to avoid interference with 
communications [6]. Microwaves can be used to heat water 
molecules. When microwaves stimulate molecules they 
promote molecular rotation and create kinetic energy which in 
turn releases heat or other forms of energy. As different 
materials have different dielectric constants, dielectric loss 
factors, heat and water contents, and different reflection and 
absorption characteristics in terms of subjection to microwave 
they can be selectively manipulated through microwave heating. 
These differential characteristics allow selective heating of the 
target material while allowing other components to be used as 
coolant during material processing. 
  
Abstract—This research uses propolis as the raw material. To 
study the microwave-assisted extraction technique in combination 
with a shearing mechanism that is adopted to increase the rate of 
contact between the solvent and extractive. The shearing 
mechanism is applied to accelerate the fracturing of the botanic 
cell walls on plant fiber. And, the integrated circulation system 
ensures the operating temperature controlled.

I. INTRODUCTION 
icrowave-assisted extraction (MAE) is a new extraction 
process method [1]. It uses microwave energy to heat a 
solvent which contacts the extract. The extract within the base 
material then attaches to the solvent. This method is 
characterized by rapid and uniform heating of the extract and 
solvent, and involves an extraction time of about 15-30 minutes 
[2]. These quantities are about 10 times smaller than volumes 
used by traditional extraction techniques, and significantly 
reduce extraction costs. In addition the microwave-assisted 
method is also used in environmental analysis [3], dry samples 
[4], microwave leaching [5] and other fields.

The traditional MAE uses microwave heating methods. 
Specifically this involves electromagnetic energy transmission 
by radiation. This method allows the heat to be applied directly 
to the solution or the materials without having to be transferred 
from the container. This significantly shortens the time required 
to complete the extraction process. To put it simply, microwave 
energy heats the solvent directly which is already in direct 
contact with the sample base material. However, high 
temperatures can easily degrade the active ingredients during 
this process. This is compensated for by the addition of a 
temperature control module that can accurately maintain the 
specified necessary temperature. 
Microwave energy is an electromagnetic radiation with 
wavelengths between 1mm to 1m and frequencies in the range 
of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. This range is most used as the 
frequency for communications, in particular the radar, cell Propolis is a substance produced by bees. It is made from 
elements of specific plant buds or bark juice which are mixed 
with bee secretions, pollen and beeswax. It has a gun like 
consistency and can be used to inhibit the reproduction of 
micro-organisms and the maintenance of an aseptic cellular 
state [7]. In addition, propolis contains many other natural 
ingredients: including gum (resin), wax, essential aromatic oils, 
pollen, various other substances and organic debris. Propolis 
does not dissolve in water, but is easily soluble in ethanol 
solution. Burdock [8] found that the main ingredient within the 
class of Propolis Flavonoids, have the ability to target and 
destroy cancer cells as well as strengthen the immune system.

D. Process of Experiment： 
This experiment used propolis soaked in ethanol as a base 
solution for extraction. The ethanol/propolis is mixed to a ratio 
of 1 gram of propolis to 9 cc of ethanol. For this experiment the 
propolis/ethanol solutions were then saturated for either 12 
hours or 14 days. The solutions were then placed in the extract 
vessels and subjected to the ultrasonic and microwave-assisted 
extraction methods shown in figure 3. The extract is then 
filtered before an HPLC analysis is conducted. The parameters 
of the experiment were set by processing a standardized 
propolis solution with known quantities of Artepillin C, CAPE, 
Quercetin and Rutin. Then, HPLC is analyzed for the quantity 
of compared with standard samples these active ingredients,

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Analysis of HPLC： 
A propolis mixture (before subjected to ultrasonic extraction 
or MAE process) was diluted 100 times and then analyzed by 
HPLC. HPLC was conducted using a separation column that 
was filled with silicone. The active ingredients separated and 
adhered to different areas on the separation column. The 
different compounds have been absorbed by specific 
wavelengths of light. These absorption properties are illustrated 
though the results of a chromatogram shown in Figure 5. The 
concentration of Artepillin C and the CAPE are 104.7ppm and 
73.8ppm respectively at the wavelength of 320nm. Figure 5 (b) 
shows that at 260nm wavelength the concentration of Quercetin 
and the Rutin are 789.9ppm and 15.2ppm respectively. The 
vertical axis denotes light intensity, and time is denoted by the 
horizontal axis.
