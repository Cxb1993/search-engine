performance demonstrated that the PZT film fabricated by the improved sol-gel method was able 
to serve as an actuator and sensor.  The frequencies of the first two modes were compared with 
the theoretical results obtained by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.  The experimental results are 
close to the theoretical data with an error of 5.19 % at the first resonance.   A simulation model 
using CFD-ACE+ was also created to verify the dynamic performance of the films.
