英文摘要 
The object of this project is to novel 
develop a high resistivity poly-Si resistor field 
plate (PRFP) which is applied to the junction 
termination design for high breakdown voltage 
power devices. Combining field plate and 
poly-Si resistor, the termination area will be 
optimized to approach the ideal plane PN 
junction breakdown voltage. 
In general, the breakdown point of the 
termination structure occurs at the high curvature 
PN junction or the silicon surface under the edge 
of the field plate, where the field plate is at 
constant potential. The object of field plate is to 
reduce the curvature effect of PN junction and 
make the distribution of potential lines smooth. 
The electric field at the silicon surface under the 
edge of field plate can be reduced by poly-Si 
resistor field plate which results in a linearly 
distributed Si surface potential from the PN 
junction edge to the field plate edge. 
In this project, the poly-Si resistor is formed 
by dual-implantation of p-type and n-type 
dopants and then annealing. The O or N ions 
may be implanted to increase the resistivity of 
poly-Si resistor. The higher resistivity of a 
poly-Si resistor will lower the power 
consumption of the termination structure. 
Second, there is a simple linear surface potential 
annealing process was performed on all samples 
for 30, 60, or 120 min. The annealing 
temperatures are 900, 1000, or 1100oC. Finally, 
BOE was used to remove the capping oxide and 
then the two terminal poly-Si resistors were 
measured by a semiconductor parameter 
analyzer of model Agilent 4156C. Three kinds of 
termination layout, disk, costa and spiral as 
shown in Fig.1 (a), (b) and (c), respectively, 
were implemented. An n-type single-crystal,

2.3x1013 - 2.9x1013 cm-3, phosphorus-doped, 
(100)- oriented silicon wafer, was used as 
substrate. First, phosphorous with dose 1x1015 
cm-2 and energy 80KeV was implanted into the 
backside of the substrate to provide ohmic 
contact at backside. Oxide was then grown to 
1µm-thick at 1050oC in wet ambient. Mask 1 
was used to define the P+ region, which was 
formed by implanting boron at 100KeV to a dose 
of 3x1015 cm-2. The P+ region was then drive-in 
to a junction depth of around 7µm. Mask 2 
defined the N+ region, which was formed by 
implanting phosphorus at 80 KeV to a dose of 
1x1015 cm-2. The N+ region was then drove-in to 
a junction depth of around 3.5µm. The poly-Si 
resistor was then defined and processed as 
described in previous paragraph. Mask 4 defined 
the contact window and mask 5 defined the 
electrode. Finally, sintering was performed at 
400oC for 30 minutes. The cross-sections of the 
final structures were shown in Fig.2(a) and (b).

Fig. 3 shows that the resistivity increases 
with the dose of phosphorous (P) for samples of 
group 4 in which amorphous silicon was formed 
at temperature 550oC. As the carriers transport 
in the poly-Si resistor, they face continuous 
P-N-P-N potential barriers. The more P-N-P-N 
potential barriers the carriers face, the higher

resistance the poly-Si has. When the dose of P 
increases, the P-N-P-N potential barrier height is 
raised and results in higher resistance for carriers 
resistivity of four set conditions is near 1MΩ-cm 
because nitrogen may suppress the growth of 
grain size. From the above results, the 
amorphous Si deposited at 550oC and implanted 
by phosphorus to a dose of 2x1015 cm-2 followed 
by 1000oC annealing achieve a resistivity higher 
than 1x106 Ω-cm for all anneal time.

Termination 
To optimize layout parameters, numerical 
simulation was performed and analyzed at first. 
Fig. 7 shows the breakdown voltage (Vbd) of the 
disk layout as a function of the poly-Si length 
(Xm) and field plate length (Xfp). When Xfp is 
fixed, Vbd increases with Xm and saturates at 
higher Xm. There is a maximum Vbd when Xm is 
fixed and Xfp increases. For a real 
implementation, Xm has a limited value so that 
an optimum Xfp can be found for a maximum 
Vbd. Fig. 8 shows the potential and electrical 
field  distribution for a seamed layout with 
parameters of seam width (Xg)=15µm, poly-Si 
width (Xf)=40µm, Xfp=100µm and Xm=900µm. 
The potential distribution demonstrates a linear 
step increasing from P+ junction. Therefore, the 
peaks of electrical field for step potential 
variations decreases linearly.

Fig. 9 shows that the variations of Xg and 
Xf have the same effect on the breakdown 
voltage. When one of these two parameters 
keeps at a fixed value, the breakdown voltage 
decreases with the increase of the other one. 
Therefore, the parameters Xg and Xf were set at 
15µm and 40µm, respectively, for seam and 
spiral layouts. The experiment for disk layout
