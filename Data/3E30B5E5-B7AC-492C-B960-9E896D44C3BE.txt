1. Introduction 
Recently, there has been an ever-increasing demand for robotic system. The two-foot robot 
needs high cost and advanced manufacture technology, while the four-wheeled mobile robot 
owns some drawbacks, e.g., large volume and circumgyrating radius etc.. In contrast, the 
two-wheeled mobile robot possesses the merits of low cost, slight volume, small circumgyrating 
radius and easy to carry etc.. If the bottlenecks of balance and stability can be tackled, the 
development space of two-wheeled mobile robot will be infinite. Although the Omniwheel or 
Transwheel can be utilized, the new problems of cost and capability will be produced. On the 
other hand, the SEGWAY has been as a personal transporter, but it needs 5 gyrospic sensors, large 
tire radius and human controlling, so it cannot be a vehicle with remote or unmanned capability. 
Looking over the IEL dissertations about two-wheeled mobile robot in recent five years, the 
design of controller is seldom and the conventional linear feedback, sliding mode or decoupled 
adaptive controllers were utilized mostly [1-7]. Although the intelligent controller has been 
adopted in other literatures, some drawbacks exist widely, such as difficult to steer on a bumpy 
road, large circumgyrating radius, needing more gyroscopes, chattering phenomena and 
increasing accumulated estimated error, etc. [8-14]. So it is a stringent topic to research a new 
two-wheeled mobile robot with high performance to overcome above drawbacks under same 
specifications of motor and tire. 
The object of this research project is to develop a novel architecture for remotely controlled 
two -autonomously-driven-wheeled robot. In the control scheme, the fuzzy inference is 
designated as a main controller and the neural network is designated as auxiliary part. To present 
the whole achievement of this development, the researching contents include the derivations of 
control equations, design of fuzzy and neuron controllers, simulation and debug under MATLAB, 
design and fabrication of the controller board as well as the chassis, writing the microcontroller 
program and dynamical tests, etc.. Finally, the simulated and experimental data will be provided 
and the results will be presented in comparison with existing two-wheeled vehicle. In this project, 
both the theory derivations and some simulation will be obtained.

3. Implementation and Numerical Simulation 
 The hardware of whole system includes a microcontroller, FPGA&RAM Card, RF receiver, 
gyroscope, infrared sensors, motor encoders, driving circuits, two autonomous controlled motors 
and mechanical chassis. The ET44210 (containing RISC CPU, AD channels and PWM outputs) 
is utilized as the control center of the system. The programmed controllers calculates the 
necessary driving currents of two motors according to detected angle of the tilt, angle rate of the 
gyroscope of the chassis, speed error, speed error rate of motors and observed lumped uncertainty. 
The hardware of the system is shown in Fig. 5; Fig. 6 shows part of the program flowcharts.

The simulation results of speed controller are shown in Fig. 7. The control law of the proposed 
intelligent controller is represented in (5), (9) and (10). To demonstrate the compactness of fuzzy 
control rules base, minimum number of membership functions are used for input and output 
linguistic variable in both simulation and experimentation such that only three fuzzy rules are 
involved in the fuzzy system ( 3,1 == mn ). The simulation condition including external load 
disturbance and parameter variationsare addressed as follows : JJ ×= 3 , BB ×= 3 , 
5.5)Nmcos( x .02 −= tTL occurring at 5.5s and removing after 8.5s, 14.0)Nmcos( x .02 −= tTL  
occurring at 14.0s and removing after 17.0s 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, a novel architecture for remotely controlled two-autonomously-driven-wheeled 
robot is developed. In the control scheme, the fuzzy inference is designated as a main controller 
and the neural network is designated as auxiliary part. In this paper,  both the  theory 
derivations and hardware implementation is presented.
