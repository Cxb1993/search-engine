I摘 要
美國 ACGIH 研究指出，已訂有容許暴露濃度之有害化學物質，其中約 25%可經由皮
膚吸收造成危害，因此選用適當有效的化學性防護衣物(chemical protective clothing)，則為
保護勞工健康的重要防護措施。各類防護手套因材質、成份、厚度及製程的差異，其防護
效果也不盡相同。在選擇安全的化學性防護手套時，除了要考慮其材質之強度、柔軟度及
化學穩定性，最重要的是其對化學物質之浸透性(permeation)需具有防護效果。而防護效能
主要考慮之因素為化學物質與手套接觸後，於手套內面偵測到化學物質的破出時間
(breakthrough time)，以及當浸透達到平衡狀態之穩定浸透速率(steady-state permeation
rate)，而此亦為一般選擇化學性防護手套之主要依據。
目前針對選擇及使用防護手套之研究，包括以下幾項重點，而此亦為本計劃之研究背
景及內容：
化學物質浸透防護手套之質傳機制；
化學混合物在防護手套之浸透性；
重複使用對手套防護效果之影響；
手套潔淨(decontamination)方法對其使用壽命(life-time)及防護效果之影響。

31. Introduction
Since use of chemical protective gloves is one of the available control options to prevent
hand skin exposure to hazardous chemicals in the work environment, appropriate selection
and use of protective gloves are important. Chemical protective gloves are made of
polymeric materials and are not indefinitely impermeable to certain chemicals such as organic
solvents. Chemicals may permeate through the protective gloves at a molecular level [1].
For a particular application, the chemical protective gloves must be selected based on
performance data indicating their resistance to the permeation of chemicals which in turn is
capable of providing adequate protection for the worker. Laboratory tests are typically
carried out to evaluate the permeation resistance of chemical protective gloves. However,
most glove manufacturers conduct permeation resistance tests for a single solvent in its pure
form, which rarely occurs in the industrial process. Workers are usually exposed to a
mixture of solvents. Data on permeation of mixture of chemicals through chemical
protective gloves are lacking. As such, there is a need to investigate the differences in
permeation resistance of protective gloves between individual and mixed chemicals.
The methods used to determine the permeation resistance of gloves include the immersion
gravimetric test and the permeation cell method [2]. The immersion method is limited as it can
provide the mass of chemicals sorbed with time but is unable to provide the permeation of mixed
chemicals through protective gloves. The permeation cell method, however, measures the
concentration of the chemicals in the collection chamber after it permeates the glove, which will
provide real time permeation information of the chemicals through the polymeric glove.
52. Experimental
2.1 Glove samples and chemicals
Permeation tests were conducted using neoprene gloves with a thickness of 0.74±0.05 mm
which were purchased from MAPA (414319, Brunswick, OH). Test samples with a diameter of
25 mm were cut from the palm section of the gloves. The thickness of each neoprene sample
was measured at five random locations to the nearest 0.01 mm using a dial thickness gauge
(Teclock Co., Japan). Before conducting permeation experiments, glove samples were prepared
by rinsing with deionized water and air-dried for 24 h at 25±1oC and a relative humidity of
50±5%. Table 1 shows the properties of chemicals for all permeation tests.
2.2 Permeation of single and mixture chemicals
Due to their low volatility, the permeation test of DMF and MEK was conducted using the
ASTM F739 method with a closed-loop system. Fig. 1 shows the sketch of the experimental
system and associated apparatus. The glove sample was mounted in the 25-mm permeation cell
(Pesce Lab Sales, Kennett Square, PA) and entirely covered by 22 mL of the test chemical.
Deionized water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and IPA were respectively used as the collection
medium and circulated through the collection chamber using a MasterFlex® PTFE tubing pump
system (CZ-77912-00, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) at a flow rate of 100 mL/min. These
solvents were selected because of their wide use as collection media in permeation tests [1, 4-6].
All equipment was connected with Teflon tubings (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) and placed in
an incubator at a temperature of 25±1oC.
7frequency of the permeant sampling [9]. For the ASTM F739 test, the standardized
breakthrough time is when a permeation rate of 0.1 µg/cm2/min is detected [3]. According to
Eq. (1), the minimum sensitivities of the GC/FID should be 0.045 mg/L for the closed-loop
system of this study. As given in Table 2, LDLs of DMF and MEK for GC/FID were 0.34~4.08
mg/L. For the closed system of ASTM F739 test, the minimum sensitivity, i.e. 0.1 µg/cm2/min,
may be inappropriate for most of the analytical methods with a GC. In ISO 6529 [10] and EN
374-3 [11], the breakthrough time isnormalized at a permeation rate of 1 μg/cm2/min instead of
0.1μg/cm2/min as used in ASTM F739 test. In this study, the standardized breakthrough time
was determined for the elapsed time at which the permeation rate reached 10 µg/cm2/min.
2.3 Back permeation of collection medium
An open-loop system was conducted to investigate the back permeation of methanol,
ethanol, acetone and IPA through neoprene samples. As shown in Fig. 2, the permeation cell
was assembled and immersed in a water bath at a temperature of 25±1oC. Nitrogen gas
supplied by a cylinder was used as the collection medium with a flow rate of 200 (±3%) mL/min,
which was measured using a flow meter in the upstream line and calibrated periodically using a
bubble flow meter (Gilibrator-2, Sensidyne Inc., Clearwater, FL) in the downstream line. The
exhaust of the downstream line was discharged into a fume hood. During the permeation
experiments, 50 μL gaseous samples were taken using a gas-tight syringe from the downstream
sampling point every 10 min. The gaseous samples were immediately injected into the
GC/FID.

energy change is defined as follows:

whereνis the volume fraction;δis the solubility parameter (M0.5LT-1); subscript s and p present
the chemical and polymer membrane, respectively.
As shown in Eq. (4), if the chemical and polymer have similar solubility parameters, the
chemical will be more soluble in the polymer. The solubility parameter for neoprene is 8.4
(cal/cm3)1/2 [13]. As shown in Table 1, the solubility parameters for DMF and MEK are 11.84
and 9.31 (cal/cm3)1/2, respectively. Therefore, the results of permeability coefficients and
breakthrough time indicate that MEK is more permeable through neoprene gloves than DMF.
For either DMF or MEK, the permeability coefficients and breakthrough time were
statistically different (p<0.05) between the five collection media using the Kruskal Wallis test.
As indicated in Table 3, the highest permeability coefficients and shortest breakthrough time
were obtained in the permeation tests using acetone as collection medium. For example, the
permeability coefficients of DMF were 10.6±0.7, 21.0±0.7, 15.9±0.3, and 12.7±1.2μg/cm/min
for the collection medium of deionized water, methanol, ethanol and IPA, respectively.
However, the permeability coefficient of DMF was as high as 76.2±0.6μg/cm/minfor acetone as
the collection medium.
From the open-loop test, methanol, ethanol, and IPA did not permeate through neoprene
samples during the 4 hour study. For the acetone challenge, the standardized breakthrough time

permeation concentration with respect to time in Eq. (8) can be solved using Maple software
(Waterloo Maple Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada). Fig. 3 shows the simulation results of MEK
in different collection media for the permeation experiments. It can be seen that the diffusion
coefficient D estimated from Eq. (9) was able to approximately simulate the permeation results
with S as the boundary condition.

where X is the mole fraction of individual chemical in the mixture; MV is the molar volume
(L3m-1);δs is the solubility parameter of pure chemical (M0.5L-0.5t-1).
As shown in Eq. (4), the smaller the difference in the solubility parameters, the more the
chemical mixture will permeate through the polymer membrane. If the difference of solubility
parameters between the pure chemical and polymer (i.e. |Δδ|) is less than that of chemical
mixture (i.e. |Δδm|), it is speculated that the breakthrough time for the component of chemical
mixture will be longer than its pure form.
The molar volume of DMF and MEK are 76.8 and 89.4 cm3/mole, respectively. In Table 5,
δm for DMF/MEK mixture was calculated to be 10.6 (cal/cm3)1/2 using Eq. (11). |Δδm| of
DMF/MEK mixture and neoprene sample was 2.2 (cal/cm3)1/2. |Δδ| for MEK was 0.91
(cal/cm3)1/2 and less than |Δδm|, which indicates that MEK promoted the permeation of DMF in
the mixture through neoprene sample. Therefore, the breakthrough time for MEK in the
mixture was 35.2±0.6 min which was longer than its pure form (i.e. 20.2±8.6 min). Also seen
in Table 5, |Δδ| for DMF was 3.44 (cal/cm3)1/2, which was greater than |Δδm|. DMF in the
mixture broke through more quickly than its pure form.
Fig. 5 shows the simulated results of Eq. (8) for the permeation experiments of DMF/MEK
mixture using methanol collection. As illustrated in Fig. 5, Eq. (8) was able to appropriately
simulate the permeation process of the mixture challenge. Because of the co-solvent effect, the
permeation concentrations of DMF and MEK were very close. Also indicated in Fig. 5, the

1. Introduction
Workers of synthetic leather industries may be exposed to the mixture solvents, such as
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and methyl ethylketone (MEK). Several studies have
indicated that dermal absorption is the important route for human DMF exposures [1-2].
DMF has been considered as a readily skin-absorbed chemical [3]. Therefore, appropriate
selection and use of the chemical protective gloves is important to prevent hand skin exposure
to DMF and MEK in the work environment.
Chemical protective gloves are not impervious to all chemicals such as organic solvents
which may permeate through the gloves at a molecular level [4-5]. The protective gloves
can be contaminated with the residual permeant. Contamination of the chemical protective
glove can degrade their resistance to the permeant and results in a potential exposure on
wearers’hands. Therefore, the chemical protective gloves should be effectively
decontaminated if they are reused [6-8].
Decontamination methods of chemical protective gloves must be effective and should
not pose any hazards to personnel or environment [7]. In general, the chemical contaminant
can be removed using wiping, rinsing, evaporation or thermal methods. Rinsing
contaminated protective gloves with surfactants or organic solvents can be more effective.
However, these decontamination methods are not economical and may damage the glove [9].
Vahdat [10] indicated that aeration and washing with detergent may not be an effective
decontamination method for removing organic solvents from neoprene, nitrile, butyl, and
PVC gloves. On the other hand, their study showed that gloves thermally decontaminated
31
2. Experimental
2.1 Glove samples and chemicals
Test specimens were cut from the palm of neoprene gloves (MAPA 414319, Brunswick,
OH), and then prepared by rinsing with deionized water and air-dried for 24 h at 25±1oC and a
relative humidity of 50±5%. The thicknesses of glove samples were measured at five random
locations to the nearest 0.01 mm using a dial thickness gauge (Teclock Co., Okaya, Japan). The
average thickness of glove samples was 0.75±0.03 mm. DMF (Mallinckrodt, UN2265), MEK
(Riedel-deHaën, 33407) and methanol (Mallinckrodt) were of GC grade with purity greater than
99%.
2.2 Permeation of DMF/MEK through gloves
The permeation test of DMF/MEK mixture (v=1:1) was conducted using the ASTM F739
method [13] with a closed-loop system. The schematic flow diagram of the experimental
apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. The glove sample was mounted in the 25-mm stainless steel
permeation cell (Pesce Lab Sales, Kennett Square, PA). Because the solubility of DMF in
water is low, methanol was used as the collection medium and circulated through the collection
chamber using a MasterFlex® PTFE-Tubing pump system (CZ-77912-00, Cole-Parmer, Vernon
Hills, IL) at a flow rate of 100 mL/min. In the closed-loop system, the total volume of
collection medium was 170 mL. As shown in Fig. 1, a spherical stirrer was used to mix well
the collection medium in the Teflon bottle. All equipment was connected with Teflon tubings
33
the DMF/MEK concentrations in the emptied challenge chamber were analyzed using GC/FID.
2.4 Decontamination and retest of gloves
In the re-exposed study, the task was conducted for 5 days which was simulated the work
shift in one week. After the first permeation test of a cycle, the specimen was then
decontaminated using one of the following methods. The decontaminated specimen was
re-exposed to the DMF/MEK mixture using the permeation cell, which was repeated four times
in a cycle. The first method of decontamination was simulated the most cases in practice. The
contaminated samples were rinsed with deionized water and aerated at 25±1oC overnight. For
the thermal decontamination methods, the contaminated samples were heated in an oven at
temperatures of 40, 70 and 100oC for 2 or 10 h, respectively. The thermally treated samples
were then aerated at 25±1oC overnight prior to the re-exposed experiments. The thermal
decontamination methods were selected because several researchers have indicated that no
degradation was detected visually in neoprene gloves heated for 16 h at 100oC [9-10, 14].
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Permeation of DMF/MEK mixture
Based on the sensitivity of GC/FID for DMF and MEK, the standardized breakthrough time
was determined for the elapsed time at which the permeation rate reached 10 µg/cm2/min. For
a closed-loop system, the steady state permeation rate, Js (ML-2T-1), was calculated by the plot of
the permeant concentrations versus time as follows:

Based on the acute toxicity, workers wearing the test glove should not continuously contact
DMF/MEK mixture more than 481 min. The steady state permeation rate for MEK was higher
than DMF, but the health risk of dermal absorption was mainly contributed from DMF.
Because of the co-solvent effect, the health risk assessment should be conducted using the
permeation test results of real components. If the worker is exposed to DMF/MEK via both
inhalation and dermal absorption routes simultaneously, Tu should be less than the estimation
calculated herein.

glove samples. As seen in Fig. 3, the DMF/MEK concentrations were obviously increased and
then maintained constant, i.e., approximately 200 and 185 mg/ L for DMF and MEK,
respectively. The volume of collection methanol was 170 mL, and the residual DMF and MEK
desorbed from gloves was approximately 34 and 31.45 mg, respectively, during a test period of
180 min. The desorbed DMF is lower than the dose of acute dermal toxicity, i.e., 4720 mg/kg
0.170 kg. However, desorption of DMF may pose a threat to the worker as wearing the
contaminated glove.
At the end of the desorption experiment, DMF and MEK volatilized into the emptied
challenge chamber was less than 1 and 5%, respectively, of the desorbed mass which can be
neglected for the modeling purpose. At the initial of desorption experiment, the residual
concentrations of DMF/MEK inside the contaminated glove were assumed to be a linear profile
described as Eq. (5). For the desorption experiment, the boundary and initial conditions of Eq.

condition of decontamination at 25oC, the average normalized SBTs were 0.69±0.23 and
0.62±0.21 min for DMF and MEK, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the breakthrough time of
the third to fifth re-exposed tests was significantly shorter than that of the new glove sample.
This may be resulted from the residual DMF/MEK permeating early through the contaminated
glove sample.
Fig. 5 shows that the permeability coefficients of the re-exposed tests were also less than
those of new samples for DMF and MEK at 25oC. This implied that steady state permeation
rates for re-exposed samples were decreased. One possible reason is the effect of dissolution of
additives, such as plasticizer, from neoprene gloves during permeation tests [14]. The
plasticizer may weaken the interaction between neoprene molecules, which enhanced
DMF/MEK moving freely. As DMF/MEK dissolved the plasticizer in neoprene samples, the
properties of re-exposed samples were different from the new ones. Therefore, the permeability
of re-exposed samples was reduced. Similar results were found in the re-exposed samples
thermally decontaminated at 40, 70, and 100oC.
As presented in Table 2, the average normalized SBTs of DMF/MEK for the re-exposed
samples, decontaminated at 40 and 70oC, were lower than those for their new ones. It was
speculated that the residual DMF/MEK was not well decontaminated from glove samples at
these temperatures. DMF and MEK may be thermally desorbed from glove samples at 100oC
for over 2 h, and the plasticizer was also come out from the glove samples. Therefore, DMF
and MEK permeated through glove samples slowly.
In order to compare the effectiveness of decontamination methods, a protective coefficient,
43
decontaminated gloves are not degraded and adequate to be reused.
4. Conclusion
As compared with DMF of the mixture, MEK had a higher permeability coefficient and a
shorter standardized breakthrough time. Therefore, MEK was more permeable through the
neoprene sample than DMF. As the permeation of DMF/MEK reached the steady state, the
concentration profiles of permeant in neoprene can be a linear distribution with the sample
thickness. Even without contacting chemicals, the residual DMF and MEK were desorbed from
the contaminated glove. Based on Fick’s law, the concentrations of DMF and MEK in the
collection medium can be appropriately simulated for the permeation and desorption experiments.
The diffusion coefficients for DMF and MEK in neoprene samples were found to be 1.39±0.14
and 1.69±0.2310-5 cm2/min, respectively.
The health risk of dermal absorption was mainly contributed from DMF because the
permeation rate of DMF through human skin is significantly higher that of MEK. According to
the acute dermal toxicity of DMF and MEK, the acceptable wear duration of test gloves was 481
min. It is noted that the permeation resistance to challenge mixtures should be determined
using the permeant of real constituents.
Based on the assessment of protective coefficients, decontamination of neoprene gloves at
70 or 100oC resulted in recovery of the permeation resistance to DMF/MEK as new ones. The
chemical resistance of neoprene gloves to DMF was the worst for decontamination at 25oC.
Although the thermal treatment was effective to decontaminate the reused gloves, further study
