英文摘要 
 
The project is proposed to develop new unconditionally stable explicit time integration 
methods which can inherit the numerical characteristics of high order implicit Runge-Kutta 
algorithms. The most important advantage for explicit methods is the calculation without solving 
any implicit system or involving any iteration procedure, and the most important advantage for 
implicit methods is the unlimited step size due to unconditional stability. Therefore, the objective 
of the proposal is to integrate these two advantages and to generate new unconditionally stable 
explicit schemes further. Moreover, we will investigate the numerical characteristics of time 
integration methods based on the viewpoint of mechanical energy conservation. To achieve this 
goal, the increment rate of mechanical energy for a linear structure is analytically derived. For 
nonlinear structures, the stability condition is derived by a spectral radius analysis based on a 
linearized map. Finally, the accuracy, computational efficiency, and numerical stability between 
the well-known time integration schemes and the proposed explicit approaches are compared when 
used to solve for numerical examples. Because the proposed explicit algorithms hold good 
numerical properties such as unconditional stability and numerical damping which can dissipate 
high frequency modes, they are valuable to be implemented in the computational process of 
real-time hybrid numerical-experimental simulation (testing) of multi-degree-of freedom systems.

After the mathematical discretization of a linear structural system, its equation of motion can be 
written as 
 + + =Mx Cx Kx f&& & ,  (1) 
where M, C, and K are the mass, viscous damping, and stiffness matrices, x , x& , and x&&  are the 
displacement, velocity, and acceleration vectors, and f is the external force vector. The general 
formulations of the proposed explicit method can be expressed as

where the subscript i denotes the ith time step, t∆  is the time increment, and 1β , 2β , 1γ  and 2γ  
are the coefficient matrices determined as the following procedure. 
First, for convenience, we assume that the system is undamped and free of external force. 
Equation (1) can be reduced to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations by introducing 
new variables which are usually made to be derivatives of the original variables as follows

Thus, the amplification matrix R is reduced to be a 2 2×  matrix in which R1, R2, R3, and R4 are 
reduced as scalars. By use of Equations (5) and (6), the coefficients in the corresponding 
amplification matrices to the three emulated Runge–Kutta methods are summarized as in Table 2. 
Furthermore, the coefficient matrices 1β , 2β , 1γ  and 2γ  used in the proposed explicit method 
are also reduced as scalars and obtained using Equation (8) as in Table 3. For convenience, these 
three proposed explicit methods are named the midpoint explicit method, the ME-BDF explicit 
method, and the 4th order SDIRK explicit method respectively. Note that the above procedure can 
be applied to any kind of Runge–Kutta algorithms and produces the equivalent explicit method. 
 
NUMERICAL STABILITY FROM VIEWPOINTS OF ENERGY CONSERVATION 
For linear or nonlinear conservative systems, energy conservation should be satisfied. Theoretically, 
the dynamics of the map resulting from different step-by-step integration schemes for solving such 
systems should closely obey this law. In other words, the law can be employed to investigate 
stability condition and algorithmic damping of these schemes. To achieve this aim, first, the 
equation of motion of an undamped single DOF system is considered as  
 0mx kx+ =&& ,  (9) 
and the energy conservation relation can be obtained by multiplying Equation (9) with the velocity 
x&  as

Theoretically, the incremental rate should be zero because energy conservation should be satisfied. 
However, due to the temporal discretization, this rate may be positive, equal to zero, or negative, 
depending on R1 and R2 for different Runge–Kutta algorithms. 
Because the amplification matrix of the proposed explicit method is the same as the one of the 
emulated implicit Runge–Kutta algorithm, the forms of the incremental rate of mechanical energy 
of the system for the proposed method and the emulated algorithm are identical. Figure 1, which 
contains two plots, shows the incremental rate of mechanical energy versus ω∆t in which ω is the 
natural frequency of the system and ∆t is the integration time step. Based on the observations on 
these two plots, there are some discussions. For the 4th order explicit Runge–Kutta method, the 
condition of stability of the method can be obtained by equating 2 2 21 2( 1)R Rω+ − to zero. The 
critical value of ω∆t is calculated as 2 2  in the case where 2 2 4 41 1 / 2 / 24R t tω ω= − ∆ + ∆  and 
2 3
2 / 6R t tω= ∆ − ∆ . When ω∆t is more than 2 2 , ∆Ei /Ei is more than zero. Thus, the energy 
grows with time, and the method becomes unstable. In contrast, for the midpoint explicit method, 
∆Ei /Ei is equal to zero and the energy can be conserved for all ω∆t. It is a well-known 
unconditional stable (A-stable) algorithm with no algorithmic damping. The ME-BDF and 4th order 
SDIRK explicit methods have two features in common. ∆Ei /Ei is less than zero for all ω∆t more 
than zero and is equal to -1 when ω∆t goes to infinity. The former means that the two methods are 
not only unconditional stable but also provide algorithmic damping, and the latter implies that the 
energy Ei+1 is completely damped out (i.e. the two methods are so-called L-stable). In particular, the 
properties of algorithmic damping of the two methods are compared. The ME-BDF explicit method 
is seen to damp the low modes too strongly since ∆Ei /Ei drops drastically when ω∆t is more than 
0.2. As a result, the ME-BDF explicit method may not only dissipate spurious high-frequency 
response due to the spatial discretization but also suppress real and dominant low-frequency 
response. In contrast, the 4th order SDIRK explicit method performs better as a “numerical low-pass 
filter”, suppressing high-frequency response and leaving low-frequency response intact. Therefore, 
from this viewpoint, the 4th order SDIRK explicit method is more valuable. 
Note that the stability criteria of time integration scheme (i.e. 1 / 0i iE E− ≤ ∆ ≤ ) derived in this 
study is equivalent to 0 ( ) 1tρ ω≤ ∆ ≤  in which ρ is the spectral radius based on eigenvalue analysis 
of the corresponding amplification matrix shown in Equation (11) in previous studies [13] and is 
equal to 2 2 21 2( )R Rω+ . 
 
NUMERICAL STABILITY IN NONLINEAR REGIME 
The advantage of involving no iterative procedures in explicit methods is more valuable when they 
are employed to solve for nonlinear problems. Thus, it is of great interest to explore the numerical 
 10
and the 4th order SDIRK explicit method.  
In this example, m and k are chosen as 1 kg and 1 Nt/m, a is considered respectively as 0.1 
Nt/m3, 1.0 Nt/m3, 2.0Nt/m3, and 10 Nt/m3, the integration time step is used as 1.0 sec, and the initial 
conditions are considered as (0) 0.5x =  and (0) 0x =& . Ideally, the mechanical energy 
( 2 2 4/ 2 / 2 / 4mx kx ax+ +& ) should be kept a constant for this nonlinear conservative system at any 
time. However, due to the temporal discretization and numerical characteristics of different 
algorithms, the mechanical energy may oscillate or decay with time. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the 
time series of mechanical energy of the system solved by the different time integration algorithms in 
the cases of different a. One may find that the midpoint and 4th order SDIRK explicit methods 
perform better than the other methods since the corresponding calculated mechanical energy 
oscillates with very small amplitude as shown in Figure 3 when a is moderately small. However, 
while a increases, this advantage may diminish because the calculated amplitude of the oscillating 
mechanical energy by the midpoint and 4th order SDIRK explicit methods is comparable with the 
one of the other schemes as shown in Figure 5. Finally, when a is large enough, all methods lose 
their stabilities as shown in Figure 6. According to the derived linearized stability condition as 
Equation (18), 0Ω  plays an important role on numerical stability of the proposed methods applied 
to nonlinear systems. 
In this example, 0Ω  can be expressed as 
2
0 0 (0)t k ax m tωΩ = ∆ = + × ∆ . Therefore, 
0Ω depends on the cubic spring stiffness a, the initial displacement (0)x , and the time step t∆  
while the linear spring stiffness k and the mass m are kept as constants. The increase of a, (0)x , 
and t∆  will increase 0Ω , which leads to numerical instability as shown in Figure 6. Furthermore, 
Figure 7 shows the defined stiffness ratio iδ  for the proposed explicit methods at each time step 
before numerical instability occurs when they are applied to solve for the Duffing oscillator with the 
cubic spring stiffness a=10.0 Nt/m3. One can easily prove that the inequality (i.e. Equation (18)) can 
not be satisfied when the stiffness ratios at the final two time steps (i.e. iδ  and 1iδ + ) shown in 
Figure 7 and the associated parameters 0Ω , 1β , 2β , 1γ  and 2γ  are substituted into Equation (18) 
for each proposed method. 
 
COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY 
In order to compare the computational efficiency between the well-known time integration schemes 
such as the Newmark explicit and average acceleration methods and the proposed explicit 
approaches such as the 4th order SDIRK explicit method, the free vibration of a couple of oscillators 
as shown in Figure 8 is solved. The mass im  and the spring stiffness ik  are considered as 1 kg 
and 10000 Nt/m and the initial conditions are assumed to be ix =  1 m and ix =&  0 m/sec for i = 1, 
2, …, n. The 50-DOF (n= 50) and 100-DOF (n= 100) systems are respectively computed. For the 
proposed explicit methods, the system mass and stiffness matrices are assembled to form the matrix 
A in Equation (3). This matrix and the coefficients mla  and mb  for the 4th order L-stable SDIRK 
method listed in Table 1 are substituted into Equations (5) and (6), and then the matrices R1, R2, R3,

500km north-south and 250km east-west, the 4th largest earthquake ever recorded in the world. The 
earthquake resulted in extensive damage in the wide areas along the Pacific coast including Tokyo 
Metropolitan area. The number of victims and missing people was nearly 20,000. This was much 
larger than the victims in 1995 Kobe earthquake. Damage was developed by ground motion, 
tsunami, liquefaction and fire. Ground motion induced damage was generally less because of the 
past seismic measures, but there are a number of lessons. Tsunami-induced damage and 
liquefaction-induced damage were extensive. Serious accident at a nuclear power plant made the 
problem complex. Since a variety of damage developed at wide area, there are a number of lessons 
learned from this earthquake. Because 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, 
2010 Maule earthquake, and 2011 Christchurch earthquake recently occurred, it is extremely 
important to share information among researchers and practitioners for mitigating earthquake risk in 
the earthquake prone countries.

ABSTRACT: In this study, a series of cyclic loading tests were conducted for three full-scale 
specimens including an existing column and two columns strengthened with wing walls 
respectively fabricated using Taiwan’s and Japan’s structural details. The experimental results 
show that the existing columns retrofitted with wing wall can effectively improve seismic 
strength and that there is no rupture of concrete cover in the base of the column with wing 
walls if using Japan’s structural details while the rupture does occur if using Taiwan’s 
structural details.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Fig. 6, 7, and 8 respectively present the hysteretic responses for the substandard column (i.e. S1), the 
substandard column retrofitted by wing walls using Taiwan structural details (i.e. S4), and the substandard 
column retrofitted by wing walls using Japan structural details (i.e. S5). Table 1, 2, and 3 summarize the 
important phenomenon observed during the test of each specimen. In addition, the ultimate shear strength for 
each column is calculated by the evaluation method found in Seismic Evaluation Standard for RC buildings

CONCLUSIONS 
 
This study focused on experimental testing for seismic retrofit of RC column with wing walls respectively 
fabricated using Taiwan’s and Japan’s structural details. The experimental results show that the existing 
columns retrofitted with wing walls can effectively improve seismic strength for either using Taiwan’s 
structural details or Japan’s structural details. It seems that the seismic performance of the columns with 
wing walls is not highly affected by different structural details since very similar hysteretic loops were 
obtained from the cyclic loading tests. It is interesting to find that there is no rupture of concrete cover in 
the base of the column with wing walls if using Japan’s structural details while the rupture does occur if 
using Taiwan’s structural details. This is because that both ends of vertical reinforcing bars near the outmost 
section of the wing wall were securely connected to existing stirrups if Japan’s structural details are 
adopted.
