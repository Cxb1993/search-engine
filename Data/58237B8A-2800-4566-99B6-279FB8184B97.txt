Abstract 
A novel numerical synthetic method, based on a recurrent circling search algorithm, is proposed 
to achieve a very low-loss normal-incidence wideband antireflection (AR) coating design. The 
design algorithm is simple and its resultant wideband AR performance is very good. The 
proposed method is then applied to the flexible poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrate for designing 
a wide-angle wideband visible (VIS) AR coating with incident angles distributing in 0-50o, and 
afterward a low-temperature ion-assisted deposition (IAD) technique is applied to realize the 
wide-angle wideband VIS AR coating on a PES substrate. It is shown that not only are the 
calculated and measured AR performances very satisfied and agreeable with each other, but this 
wide-angle VIS AR filter also reveals a quite acceptable omni-directional wideband VIS 
antireflective effect.       
 
Keywords: design algorithm, recurrent circling search method, wide-angle and wideband visible

Here, Y0  and Y  are the optical admittance of incident medium (air) and input optical 
admittance of the N-layer system, respectively. 
B) Recurrent circling searches the physical thickness of the layers in each circle one by one 
from the smallest circle to the largest circle of the multilayer system to reduce MF, and  
then recurrent circling searches from the largest circle to the smallest circle, in which the 
smallest circle contains the central two layers N/2 and N/2+1 of the multilayer stack, and 
the largest circle contains the innermost and outermost layers of 1 and N. The recurrent 
circling search operation is performed as follows: First, tune the thickness of layer N/2, 
then rotate from layer N/2 to layer N/2+1 and tune the thickness of layer N/2+1, and 
afterward rotate from layer N/2+1 to layer N/2 and tune the thickness of layer N/2. Repeat 
the circling search until the MF is no longer refined in these two layers of the smallest 
(central) circle and then search the next circle. Second, tune the thickness of layer N/2-1, 
then rotate from layer N/2-1 to layer N/2+2 and tune the thickness of layer N/2+2, and 
afterward rotate from layer N/2+2 to layer N/2-1 and tune the thickness of layer N/2-1. 
Repeat the circling search until the MF is no longer refined in these two layers of the 
second circle and then search the next circle. Third, tune the thickness of layer N/2-2, then 
rotate from layer N/2-2 to layer N/2+3 and tune the thickness of layer N/2+3, and afterward 
rotate from layer N/2+3 to layer N/2-2 and tune the thickness of layer N/2-2. Repeat the 
circling search until the MF is no longer refined in these two layers of the third circle and 
then search the next circle. Last, tune the thickness of layer 1, then rotate from layer 1 to 
layer N and tune the thickness of layer N, and afterward rotate from layer N to layer 1 and 
tune the thickness of layer 1. Repeat the circling search until the MF is no longer refined in 
these two layers of the largest (outermost) circle. Reverse the search direction and then 
recurrent circling search from the largest circle to the smallest circle. The recurrent circling 
search operation given above is continuously performed until the MF is no longer refined 
when passing through all the layers. When tuning the thickness of a layer, the layer 
thickness is either decreasing or increasing to reduce the MF and its thickness is replaced 
with the thickness that can yield a lower minimum MF; otherwise, the original layer 
thickness is restored and the next layer is then tuned. 
 
C) To improve the AR performance further and simplify the design structure as well, different 
types of elimination operation given below are then carried out. 
a) Elimination from layer 1 to layer N. 
b) Elimination from layer N to layer 1. 
c) Elimination from the thin layer to the thick layer. 
d) Elimination from the thick layer to the thin layer. 
In layer elimination, the layers with the same refractive index can be combined in to a 
new layer and then the recurrent circling search operation given in previous step is 
restarted to reduce MF. Once the MF is refined, a simple design accompanied by better 
AR performance is thus yielded and a new pass of the elimination operation is then 
performed. If the MF is not refined, then the eliminated layer is restored and the next layer 
is eliminated. Once when the MF is no longer refined when passing through all the layers, 
the elimination operation is then terminated and the desired solution is considered to be 
obtained.

The design method proposed in this study can generate its initial design using a two-material 
multilayer system with a binary code of high and low refractive indices, and then optimizes its 
broadband AR performance and design structure successively by the recurrent circling search 
operation and elimination operation to yield the desired designs. Moreover, the search algorithm 
of the design method is very plain and straightforward, and can be applicable to the film materials 
and substrate medium with dispersive or nondispersive optical constants. Even if the starting 
designs are the same, and different elimination operations may lead to different final designs, 
their resultant broadband AR performances were revealed to be very good and also quite 
agreeable to each other. 
 
2.3 Wide-angle and Wideband VIS AR Coating Design 
The proposed design method [11] as well as the scanning search approach [13] is then successive 
applied to the wide-angle wideband visible AR coating design of flexible PES substrate with the 
incident angles ranging in 0-50o [14]. It is shown that the final results of the wide-angle wideband 
visible AR coating design for both the recurrent circling search and scanning search approaches 
are very similar and comparable to each other. Here, the merit function of these methods in the 
search process, defined the average wide-angle wideband reflectance of incident angles 0 and 50o 
over 71 equal wavelength positions in the VIS regions, is used

range with the angle interval of 1o and the wavelength interval of 1 nm is reduced from 6.44% 
(uncoated substrate) to 0.51%. And the variation of AVSR with incident angle in the designed 
range 0-50o is displayed in Fig. 9(b); the AVSR for the uncoated substrate is increasing with 
incident angle from 6.09 to 8.05% and that AVSR of the simulated (calculated) AR coating 
substrate is slowly decreasing from 0.38% for the normal incidence to a minimum 0.32% at the 
angle of 23o, and then increasing to 1.59% at the angle of 50o. It is shown that the AVSR of the 
simulated AR coating substrate is barely changing as the angle smaller than 35o and then 
significantly increasing as the angle beyond then 40o. The AVSR dramatically increases at the 
large incident angle is mainly due to the difference between the substrate refractive indices of p- 
and s-polarizations (polarization effect) is significantly, which leads to the difficulty of the design 
of AR coating and an increase in AVSR at large incident angle thus results. It is also found that 
the reduction of AVSR (difference in AVSR for the uncoated substrate and simulated AR coating 
substrate) with respect to incident angle, shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 9(b), is slowly 
varying from 5.71 to 6.42%, indicating that the AR effects for every incident angle in the  
designed range are very comparable and close to each other. Furthermore, the values of AVSR for 
the incident angle beyond the designed range, shown in Fig. 10, are also reduced to lower than 
those of uncoated substrate except that at the angle of 90o, in which the difference in AVSR is 
increasing to a maximum 7.28% at the angle 69o and then decreasing to 0 at the angle of 90o. 
Thus, it is shown that not only the wide-angle wideband vis AR coating design has a quite 
acceptable wide-angular VIS AR performance in the designed angle range, but it also reveals a 
wideband VIS AR effect beyond the designed range.     
 
          Table III. Construction parameters of design in Fig. 8(a). 
 
 
The AVSR verses to incident angle of the simple AR coating design is also displayed in Figs. 
9(b) and 10. It is shown that the AVSR of the scanning search AR-coating design is much 
superior to that of the simple AR coating design for every incident angle (except 90o), and that the 
wide-angle wideband VIS AR performance of the total average reflectance over the designed 
angle range 0-50o in the spectral region 400-750 nm (with an angle interval 5o and a wavelength 
interval 1 nm) for the scanning search AR-coating design 0.55% is much better than that value 
2.45% for the simple AR coating design. Moreover, the simple V-coating design also displays an 
AR effect beyond the angle of 50o, but it reveals inferior to that of the scanning search 
AR-coating design.

source (Veeco Mark I) with a diameter of 5 cm as shown in Fig. 11. The distances for the electron 
gun and the ion source to substrate were 47 and 18 cm, respectively, and the incident angle of the 
ion beam was 35o. The coating materials were TiO2 and SiO2 with a purity of 99.99% and the 
physical thickness of the films was monitored using a crystal quartz thickness monitor. The area 
and thickness of the PES substrate were 22 cm2 and 2 mm, respectively.  
Before deposition, the base pressure of the coater chamber, 5105   Torr, was established by 
using a cryopump. During the deposition, a working pressure of 4102   Torr was maintained 
by introducing the mixture of O2 and Ar into the coater chamber. Film materials TiO2 and SiO2 
were evaporated using an e-gun and IAD with ion beam voltage of 130 V and beam current of 50 
mA, and the growth of film thicknesses were controlled at a deposition rate of 0.1 and 0.2 nm/s, 
respectively. The substrate was mounted on the substrate holder and rotated at 21 rpm; the 
substrate temperature, measured using a thermal couple, varied from 100 to 180oC during the 
deposition. The VIS reflection spectra when the AR coating was coated on the interface of the 
substrate were measured using a UV-NIR spectrophotometer.

3.2 Results and Discussions  
Figures 12 and 13 display the experimental AR performances of the IAD wide-angle and 
wideband VIS AR coating in the designed range. The measured VIS reflection spectra of the 
normal incidence and the oblique incidence at the angle 50o, shown in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b), are 
very close to those of the calculated AR performances, in which the measured and calculated 
AVSRs at normal incidence are reduced from 6.09% (uncoated PES) to 0.50 and 0.38 %, and that 
AVSRs at the incident angle 50o are reduced from 8.05% to 1.61 and 1.59%, respectively. These 
measured AR performances of the AR coated PES at incident angles 0 and 50o are quite 
acceptable and comparable to those of the simulated AR coating design. The AVSRs verses to 
incident angle for the uncoated substrate, calculated and measured AR coating substrates, 
displayed in Fig. 13, are shown by the black, gray and white columns, respectively, the VIS AR 
performances for the measured and calculated AR coating substrates at each incident angle are 
comparable to each other. It is shown that the measured AVSRs of the AR coated PES substrate 
for the incident angle less than 35o are good, and when the incident angle beyond than 40o, the

incident angle 80o. (b) Measured AVSR verses to incident angle in the range 51-80o. 
 
On the other hand, the average VIS reflection spectra Rav(λ), defined the average reflectance 
over a desired wide-angle range with an angle interval of 5o verses to wavelength in the VIS 
region, for the average over the designed angle range 0-50o and the incident angle range 0-80o are 
shown in Fig. 15; the measured average vis reflection spectra are very agreeable to that of the 
calculated spectra, in which their total average vis spectral reflectances (TAVSRs) over the angle 
range of 0-50o are reduced from 6.50% for the uncoated substrate to 0.63 and 0.55% and that 
TAVSRs over the angle range 0-80o are reduced from 11.46% to 5.16 and 5.21%, respectively. 
 The value of Rav(λ) increases dramatically at the long wavelength as the angle range is 
enlarged, implying that the VIS reflectance increases significantly at the long wavelength of large 
incident angles, which may be attributed to the polarization effect becomes strong and a decrease 
of the antireflective effect thus results. It is therefore found that not only the wide-angle wideband 
VIS AR performance of the AR coated PES is quite acceptable in the designed wide-angle range, 
but also its VIS reflectances beyond the designed range are reduced to lower than that of the 
uncoated substrate, which reveals an omni-directional wideband VIS AR performance.
