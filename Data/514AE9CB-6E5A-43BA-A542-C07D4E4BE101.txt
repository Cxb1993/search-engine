Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services are systems that assign users’ specific transport 
requests to different vehicles enabled to fulfill the required service. In particular this research 
focuses in describing the design of the human-machine interface agents for emergency handling 
and its dynamic route guidance. The perspectives of this research work on human-machine 
interfaces for supervision involve several points. Firstly, we construct a platform with simulation 
mechanism that can quickly make a quality response and decision to environment to enhance 
management. Secondly, one of the perspectives of this work is to put forward a multi-agent 
design method for more interactive applications in the process control/command field. Finally, 
our current research concerns the study of the utility and performance assessment methods for 
such agent-based human-machine interfaces.

In this period of research we have published the following papers:

multi-agent approach”, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management, Vol. 2, 
No. 2, pp. 360-386, 2009.

Multi-agent Approach to Transport Demands”, International Journal of Computer

In the following we will report on one of the topic in detail: 
  
the cooperating knowledge of each of the system’s software agents. In our architecture, we 
suggest using a division into three functional containers, which we have called, respectively: 
agent container, environment container, and scenario container (see figure 2). These three 
containers group together agents: 
 
Figure 2. The architecture of multi-agent system 
 
(1) The agent container, which have six kinds of agents: electric-taxis, control center, 
passengers, electric stations, road and stops. Agents are divided into two types. First type is active 
agents those have their own structures and behaviors. Second type is passive agents those only 
have their structures. 
The specification of each type of agent is as follows: 
(i) Passive Agents (PA): This category of agents represents entities that have a structure, 
without a behavior. Usually, a large part of the elements contained in the simulation 
environment belongs to this category. 
(ii) Active agents (AA): This category of agents represents entities, which have structures and 
behaviors: These entities actively participate in the simulation. For this category, we must 
specify the data structures of the entities (spatial and non-spatial structures) as well as their 
behaviors (spatial and non-spatial behaviors). 
 
(2) The environment container, which is composed of time container, data container, event 
container and interaction behaviors container. Interaction behaviors container includes traffic jam, 
dial-a-ride and electricity replenishing behaviors. 
(3) The scenario container, which includes scenarios and management policies (such as path 
planning etc.).

In simulation field, off-line can allow user to initialize MADRT operation system to understand 
the threshold and trend under certain scenario. On-line (graphic user interface) can allow user 
make a reasonable decision real time that can save a lot of cost and time for user. In order to 
achieve these objects, we provide off-line decision analysis and on-line decision support. We will 
apply case study PDP and DAR as our off-line decision analysis and off-line decision analysis 
will be specified in case study. For on-line decision support, we construct GUI to help user make 
decision real time. Another GUI function is as the communication bridge between user and agents. 
Through GUI, user can directly communicate with agent. An available simulation model should 
be operated by user. Simulation model is not only established for animation. Simulation model 
should be verified by user. A MADRT human-machine interface agents operation simulation 
system which can be operated by user will increase its application area and flexibility. 
 
5. 計畫成果自評 
   This project has been correctly carried out according to its original proposal. Major 
accomplishments include: 
 The goal of achieving highly flexible and adaptive behavior that would allow interface agents 
and humans to work effectively in DRT problem situations. 
    The development of user interfaces, following the “Design-for-all” philosophy, oriented 
towards a multi-agent system interacting with an intelligent engine.. 
 MADRT platform information will be useful in determining whether the vehicles are 
servicing customers according to the generated schedule. It is also useful in emergency 
handling and its dynamic route guidance. 
 The theoretical findings obtained in this project provide an important foundation for a systematic 
implementation of human-machine interface agents design. Two journal papers based on this 
research have been published. The results of this work enable a systematic and easy 
implementation of a MADRT platform for emergency handling and its dynamic route guidance. 
They are of a high value in practical applications. Collaborations with and technology transferring 
to industries are greatly feasible.
