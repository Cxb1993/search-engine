exhibit two problems. First, most navigation systems 
adopt a static shortest path algorithm to determine the 
routing path. They yield the shortest distance route to 
navigate, but may need higher exhausted gasoline and 
more travel time. Second, the TIC-based approaches 
require a centralized provider to gather traffic information 
from a huge number of monitoring devices and from 
drivers’ reporting information. It leads to low reliability, 
error reporting and obtaining partial traffic information 
only. 
In [19], Srini et al. studied the sensing technologies 
in WSN cooperating with the Global Position System 
(GPS) for a vehicle to collect real-time traffic 
information, and then the traffic information can be 
exchanged among vehicles. In [8], Obradovic et al. 
proposed a two-step sensor-fusion that can be applied to 
commercial vehicle navigation systems. Moreover, in 
Europe, the Car to Car Communication Consortium 
(C2C-CC) [20] defines the standards for ITC and 
communication between the wireless base station and 
vehicles. 
Most vehicle navigation systems, e.g., GARMIN [14], 
TomTom [15] and PAPAGO [17], adopt a static routing 
algorithm to determine the shortest distance path for 
navigated vehicles. Because these systems are lack of 
considering the real-time traffic information, e.g., the 
information of traffic jam and emergency accidents, the 
travel time and exhausted gasoline increase as the traffic 
load increases. For improving these systems using the 
static routing algorithm, TomTom PLUS [17], TomTom 
Radio Data System/Traffic Message Channel 
(RDS/TMC) [15] and Mio C710 navigation [16] have 
been proposed the optional function to obtain the traffic 
information sent from a centralized TIC via the General 
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or Radio Data System. 
Additionally, PAPAGO R15 [17] has proposed an 
optional function to gather periodical traffic information 
from TIC through the Internet. Two challenges exhibit in 
RDS/TMC [14][15][16] and PAPAGO [17]. First, the 
moving vehicles cannot always connect to the Internet. 
Second, it is expensive to deploy the huge number of 
monitoring devices on all roads. If vehicles cannot obtain 
the real-time traffic information from the TIC, the 
determined routing path is similar to the shortest distance 
path. 
In [21], Hull et al. proposed a distributed mobile 
sensor computing system, namely CarTel; however, the 
centralized system still has the problems of low reliability 
and small wireless coverage. Based on the Intelligent 
Transportation System (ITS), [22][23] proposed the 
Wireless sensor network ITS (WITS) to increase 
efficiency, but increases the time complexity of 
positioning and leads to inaccurate position. 
IVC provides peer-to-peer transmissions among 
vehicles, and thus reduces access delay and cost. Since 
IVC has not yet been developed successfully, Wischhof et 
al. [9] proposed the Segment-Oriented Data Abstraction 
and Dissemination (SODAD) scheme as the data 
transmission protocol for highly mobile C2C 
communications. However, in SODAD, all roads should 
be partitioned into several road segments, and each 
segment is viewed as a unit for traffic collection and 
analysis. Based on the Zero Public Infrastructure system 
(ZPI), Zhang et al. [10] proposed an inter-vehicle traffic 
information system for vehicles to exchange traffic 
information by using IEEE 802.11b. However, the small 
wireless coverage of IEEE 802.11b is unsuitable for 
high-mobility vehicles. 
Since high-mobility vehicles require an efficient 
communication protocol for exchanging information, 
Biswas et al. [11] proposed a highway Cooperative 
Collision Avoidance (CCA) system based on the 
Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) 
standard. DSRC was designed for the electronic toll 
collection rather than for the network-based IVC. Some 
routing protocols for C2C communications are mentioned 
in [24][25].  
The routing strategies in VANET can be classified 
into three types: the on-demand, proactive and Geocast 
routing strategies [37]. First, in protocols using the 
on-demand strategy require setting up a route before 
sending packets rather than periodically maintaining the 
routing table. Without maintaining the routing state 
information, mobile nodes significantly save energy 
power; thus, the network lifetime of the on-demand ad 
hoc network is longer than that of the proactive networks. 
The typical protocols of the on-demand strategy include 
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) [38] and Ad hoc 
On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) [39]. The DSR 
protocol has the problems of route discovery flooding and 
non-scalable for large scale of ad hoc networks. On the 
other hand, in AODV, the destination node only replies to 
the node that sends the first arrival RREQ message with a 
RREP message. AODV only stores one routing entry for 
each direction of an active route and is more scalable than 
DSR.  
Second, in protocols using the proactive strategy, the 
routing state information of mobile nodes is exchanged 
periodically with neighbor nodes. It achieves the 
advantages of fast routing but causes large energy 
consumption for maintaining the up-to-date routing table. 
The protocols of the proactive strategy adopt the link state 
algorithm. Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse 
Path Forwarding (TBRPF) [40], Fisheye State Routing 
(FSR) [41] and Optimized Link State Routing Protocol 
(OLSR) [42] are the typical examples of the proactive 
strategy. In addition, many researches [43][44] have 
compared the performance among these routing strategies 
and have shown that protocols using the on-demand 
strategy outperform those using other routing strategies.  
Third, the Greedy Perimeter Stateless ad hoc 
Routing protocol (GPSR) [26] are seldom adopted even 
though they efficiently support data transmission in IVC 
and can be selected as the protocol for VANET 
[27][28][29]. Additionally, the Geocasting protocol [29] 
could be applied to C2C as the position-based routing 
scheme. Moreover, FLEETNET [30] developed the 
Linux-based FleetNet Router with the GPSR routing 
protocol for C2C communications, but short transmission 
range of IEEE 802.11++ cannot meet the demand of 
high-speed vehicles.  
From extensive related works, most studies 
[9][10][21][22][23] use WiFi and Zigbee as the wireless 
transmission interfaces, but the low-mobility and

Phase 1: The phase of sensing and broadcasting the 
traffic information 
In D-WAN, some vehicles are equipped three 
devices, including 
(1) Different type sensors to sense the speed and 
direction of neighbor vehicles within the sensing 
range of sR , 
(2) The wireless network interface to send/receive the 
traffic information to/from neighbor vehicles within 
the wireless range of tR , and  
(3) GPS to get the longitude and latitude of its position. 
Only the vehicle equipped with the wireless network 
interface can receive the traffic information from 
neighbor vehicles equipped with the sensor and wireless 
network devices. In Phase 1, vehicles periodically sense 
the traffic information and then update into the local 
traffic table. The traffic information is exchanged with 
one-hop neighbor vehicles through the wireless network. 
As a result, vehicles can gather the up-to-date traffic 
information: the number of vehicles, the average speed of 
roads and current position. Note that the same message is 
with the same message ID. Thus, in this work a vehicle 
will simply discard a message that has been received 
before, and the work does not bring large overhead of the 
message exchange. 
In Fig 1, a two-way road is encoded by two 
unidirectional roads in a digital map; thus, in this work, 
the network topology consists of the unidirectional roads 
and every road has two end-nodes. For example, two 
directional roads x  and y are defined in Figure 1, where 
the road x  is from node j  to node k , and the road 
y  is from node k  to node j . The sensed traffic 
information of a vehicle is denoted by rN  and rv , 
where rN represents the number of vehicles and rv is 
the average speed on a road r , respectively, as indicated 
in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 1. Node and road structures 
 
After obtaining the sensed information, a vehicle n  
updates the information into its local traffic table, which 
will be periodically broadcasted with the information of 
the vehicle ID, current position and a timestamp, i.e., 
nID , ( , )nx y and nT , to one-hop neighbor vehicles 
through the wireless network, as indicated in Fig. 3. 
When the neighbor vehicle receives the broadcast 
information, it will update the traffic table.

Consequently, the traffic density on the road r  consisted 
of these two parameters can be expressed by ( ),r r rv Dr = .  
Step 3. Determine road weights based on the traffic 
density 
This paper considers two types of average vehicle 
speed, i.e., the high and low types of average speed, and 
two types of average vehicle distance, i.e., the long and 
short types of average vehicle distance. The average 
vehicle speed is more important than the average vehicle 
distance. Since a road with high average vehicle speed 
can support short travel time, a road with a long average 
vehicle distance couldn’t guarantee short travel time. Fig. 
7 demonstrates that the proposed approach classifies a 
road weight into four priorities (i.e., priorities 1, 2, 3, and 
4) based on two determined parameters of rv  and rD .

The concept of the classification of traffic density is 
to set the road with high average vehicle speed and long 
average vehicle distance to the first priority (i.e., the 
highest priority), to set the road with high average vehicle 
speed and short average vehicle distance to the second 
priority, etc. As a result, the road weight is formulated by 
the binary exponential function of the priority index, i.e., 
12 ,pw -= where w  and p denote the weight and 
priority of the road, respectively. Therefore, the proposed 
approach is capable of supporting V  types of the 
average vehicle speed and D  types of the average 
vehicle distance. It thus generates V D×   priorities that 
will be weighted by the exponential weighting function of  
( ) 12 V Dw × -= .  
Additionally, the phase of determining weights of 
roads is also called the traffic coloring phase. We color 
roads on the digital map based on the roads’ priorities, 
e.g., a light green road supports high speed and long 
vehicle distance. Such a coloring function clearly 
demonstrates the real-time traffic density of each road on 
the navigation system. Fig. 8 demonstrates an example of 
the coloring result. 
 
Fig. 8. An example of road coloring based on the traffic 
density 
 
Phase 4: The phase of determining the least cost route 
After weighting and coloring roads based on the 
traffic density, the proposed approach considers another 
two metrics of each road: the road class k  and the road 
distance d . That is, a road r  is associated with three 
metrics of ( ), ,r r rk w d , where 1 rk K£ £  and 1rk =  
is the highest road class (i.e., the highway class).  
The cost of a road is formulated by  
$ µ $
1 2 3 ,r r rrc k w da a a= × + × + ×       (7) 
where $ rk , µ rw  and $ rd are the normalized values of the 
road class rk , the road weight rw  and the road 
distance rd , respectively. The concept of the 
normalized parameters is to normalize the value range of 
individual metric between 0 and 1. As a result, the cost

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
This section evaluates the proposed D-WAN approach 
and other navigation systems by comparing several 
performance metrics: average travel time, average 
exhausted gasoline and average travel distance. The 
compared approaches include the Shortest Path approach 
(SP), the Road Class approach (RC) and the Shortest Path 
with Road Class approach (SPRC). Moreover, the 
performance metrics under the different number of 
vehicles, different accident probabilities and different 
sensor-based vehicle ratios are evaluated. Finally, the 
average traffic load and the traffic load balancing index 
(TLBI) are evaluated. The simulation tools are developed 
by using .Net C++ on the Windows operating system, in 
which the parameters of the simulation network, traffic, 
and mobility are set via a graphic user interface (GUI). 
The 95% confidence intervals of the simulation results in 
the following figures originate from 25 independent runs. 
For each run, the simulated time is 1100 units of mean 
connection holding time. The initial 100 time units are 
considered the transient period and performance samples 
are thus discarded. 
Figure 10 demonstrates the evaluated network that is 
located in Taipei, where the area covers 327 intersection 
nodes and 527 roads and 5 road classes. The network 
topology of the digital map is developed, in which several 
databases are created to record the geographic 
information of roads and nodes derived from the Road 
Network Digital Map v.1.2 [35] of the Institute of 
Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications (MOTC) in Taiwan. Fig. 1 demonstrates 
some important data structures of the digital map. In 
addition, the gasoline consumption of a vehicle under 
different speeds [36] is examined. Finally, the simulation 
parameters are summarized in Table IV.

We first evaluate three performance metrics of all 
compared approaches under different number of vehicles 
(i.e., denoted by NDS) ranging from 1000 to 8000, as 
shown in Figs. 11-13.  When NDS increases up to 7000, 
the traffic is entering into the peak state. Conversely, 
when NDS decreases to 3000, it is entering into the 
off-peak state. In Fig. 11, the average travel time of all 
approaches increases as NDS increasing. The result meets 
the real environment because the vehicle speed reduces 
when NDS increasing. In addition, D-WAN yields the 
least average travel time but SP always yields the longest 
average travel time. The reason is that D-WAN considers 
the traffic density and supports the adaptive re-routing, 
and thus D-WAN obviously avoids selecting high traffic

In Fig. 16, the average exhausted gasoline of all 
approaches increases when the accident probability 
increases. D-WAN yields the least average exhausted 
gasoline but SP results in the highest average exhausted 
gasoline. In addition, SPRC yields the lower average 
exhausted gasoline than that of RC. The main reason is 
D-WAN avoids routing to the roads occurred accidents. 
However, such static routing algorithms of SP, RC and 
SPRC may select the roads with some accidents, and then 
result in longer travel time and more exhausted gasoline.

To evaluate D-WAN with few vehicles equipped 
sensors, we consider the parameter of the sensor-based 
vehicle ratio, ranging from 0% to 100%. The 100% ratio 
means all vehicles are equipped the sensors, and vice 
versa. In Figs. 17-19, the compared approaches are 
evaluated under different sensor-based vehicle ratios. In 
Fig. 17, the average travel time of SP, RC and SPRC are 
independent of the sensor-based vehicle ratio, because 
they adopt the static routing algorithms. Clearly, SPRC 
yields the least time, but SP yields the highest time. The 
average travel time of D-WAN decreases as the 
sensor-based vehicle ratio increasing. If the ratio is 0%, 
D-WAN and SPRC yield the same average travel time. 
D-WAN reduces about 33% average travel time of SPRC 
under 100% ratio.

In Fig. 18, the average travel distance of SP, RC and 
SPRC are also independent of the sensor-based vehicle 
ratio. RC yields the longest distance, but SP and SPRC 
yield the shortest distance. The distance of D-WAN is 
between that of RC and SPRC. The distance of D-WAN 
may increase as the ratio increases, because the navigated 
vehicle can receive more traffic information and then 
performs re-routing through the roads with lighter traffic 
but longer distance.

 and Coding Scheme (MCS) by using the received feedback CSI 
information in a mobility environment. In [9][10][11], they 
propose the estimations of channel state.  
In the close-loop system, the water-filling theory can yield 
the optimal power allocation. Although the studies [12][13][14] 
adopt the water-filling-based schemes, they cannot lead to 
better results because the accurate CSI is difficult to be 
obtained. Several studies [18][20][21] try to reduce the number 
of feedback messages and to increase the accuracy of the CSI 
estimation, but the results are limited in the realistic wireless 
networks, especially in the high mobility environment. 
This paper thus proposes a MIMO close-loop-based solution 
that consists of two schemes. First, we propose the polynomial 
extrapolation-based SNR prediction (PESR) to estimate CSI 
accurately even though the sender cannot always receive the 
CSI message. Second, we propose the adaptive proportional 
power allocation (ARPA) to allocate transmission power to 
every MIMO antenna according to the determined SNR and 
MCS, and thus maximize the system capacity. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The 
network model of our strategy is proposed in Section . In Ⅱ
Section , we describe the proposed adaptive Ⅲ CSI prediction 
and the MCS determination in detail. Numerical results of the 
proposed approach are evaluated in Section . Conclusions Ⅳ
and future works are given in Section .Ⅴ   
II. NETWORK MODEL 
In this section, we model the MIMO channel between the 
sender and receiver as a matrix H , in which the wireless 
interference of each channel is formulated by the flat Rayleigh 
fading theory [5]. The MIMO channel matrix is demonstrated 
in Eq. (1), in which tN and rN are denote as the total number of 
transmission antennas and the total number of receive antennas, 
respectively.

For instance, ijh represents the channel of the i th-
transmission antenna and the j th- receive antenna; 
additionally, ijh is assumed to be generated by the Gaussian 
distribution random numnber. 
Thus, the received signal vector y , 1rNy ´Î£ , can be 
formulated by y H x n= × + , where x , 1tNx ´Î£ , denotes the 
transmitted signal vector and n  denotes the channel 
interference vector that is determined by the independent and 
identically distributed (i.i.d.) Additive White Gauss Noise 
(AWGN). 
The cross-interference is easily happened in MIMO, 
because the wireless signals are extremely close to each other. 
In [15][16], the studies propose the Zero-Forcing (ZF) 
approach to reduce the interference, and then increase the 
system capacity. Theoretically, by using the Singular Value 
Decomposing (SVD) operation, the MIMO channel matrix, H , 
can be divided into several parallel sub-channels as follows, 
,HH U S V= × × where U is a r rN N´ receive matrix and

where SE and 0N are the transmission power for each symbol

Finally, the received SNR at the i th-  subchannel is 
denoted as, i i iSNR Pl= × , where iP  is the i th- transmission

where ia is the Vandermonde index. After determining n+1 
ia coefficients, the next observation of the ( 1m + )-th one, 1mx + , 
can be computed by the extrapolation operation, 
1m mx m D+ = + ,                               (16)

Consequently, the prediction SNR of the (m+1)-th observation 
can be determined by 
1( )mf x + . Since 'predictionSNR , i.e., 
1( )mf x + , is obtained, the predictive SNR of the original 
sequence, predictionSNR , i.e., 1mS + , can be determined by the 
inverse transformation of Eq. (12), i.e., Inverse Accumulated 
Generating Operation (IAGO), as 
1 1m m mS x x+ += - .                            (18) 
B. Adaptive Proportional Power Allocation (ARPA) 
In a close-loop MIMO system, the sender cannot always 
receives the feedback CSI message that includes the 
information of SNR and MCS. If the CSI message is lost, the 
sender easily uses inaccurate SNR and MCS to allocate power 
for wireless channels and then leads to low system capacity and 
high power consumption. Especially, under high mobility or 
high wireless interference, the performance is degraded 
significantly.  
This paper has proposed the PESR and AHA schemes to 
predict SNR and MCS when the CSI message is lost. Based on 
the water-filling theory, we now propose the Adaptive 
Proportional Power Allocation, namely ARPA, to compute the 
new transmission power for channel j , jP , by using the 
predictive SNR. The total power used for N times transmissions 
is denoted as TotalP , and then the power allocated for the i th-  
transmission, denoted by iP , becomes  
,   1,2, , .totali

Thus, the power allocated for the j th-  channel at the i th-  
transmission, ,i jP , is formulated as

where il is the eigen value of allocated power used at the i-th 
transmission and ,i jl  is the eigen value of allocated power 
used for the j-th channel at the i-th transmission.  il  is defined

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
This section evaluates the proposed approach by comparing 
various performance metrics: mean relative error, the system 
capacity, the MCS hit ratio, and the MCS change probability. 
The compared approaches include the water-filling scheme 
(WF) [19], the QoS-based water-filling (IWF) scheme [13], and 
the equal power allocation (EP) scheme [19]. The compared 
prediction algorithms include the Exponentially Weighted 
Moving Average (EWMA) [25], Mobile EWMA (M-EWMA) 
[25], Gray Model (GM) [26], and Gray Polynomial (GP) [27]. 
The evaluated parameters, as shown in Table I, of the 
system model are based on the downlink channel of the IEEE 
802.16m Evaluation Methodology Document (EMD) [1]. The 
evaluated system is an 8*8 MIMO system with White Gaussian 
noise variance, 2s . The system adopts several different 
constellation sizes of M-QAM and M-BPSK as the adaptive 
modulation and coding scheme, where { }2, 4,16,64,256M Î . 
In addition, in the close-loop MIMO system, we assume that 
the high mobility feature is applied to the system, and then the 
MIMO channel state is always changed. The one-bit Change 
Indication Flag (CIF) is adopted to notify the sender whether 
the receiver replies the CSI message or not. If yes, CIF is set to 
1; otherwise, CIF is set to 0.

Figure 2 compares the accurate MCS determination among 
different SNR prediction schemes used in the proposed 
approach. From Fig. 3, we can see that the proposed PESR 
results in 97.02% accurate MCS prediction rate, i.e., the highest 
one. Conversely, EWMA yields the lowest accurate MCS 
prediction rate. The reason is that PESR achieves accurate 
prediction of SNR and selects the correct MCS scheme.
