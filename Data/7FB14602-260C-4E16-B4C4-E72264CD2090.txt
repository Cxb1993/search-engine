Abstract 
 
Cooperative bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is a key technology for the next-generation wireless 
communication systems. This paper investigates power allocation for the cooperative BICM systems with 
decode-remap-and-forward (DRF) relaying. Unlike the conventional decode-and-forward relays, the DRF 
relays may choose different constellation mappings from that of source so as to obtain a remapping gain. In 
spite of its importance, the power allocation in such a system has not yet been explored in the literature. Two 
new power allocation methods are proposed, aiming to minimize bit error rate at the destination. The first uses 
a cost function based on the minimum weighted squared-Euclidean distance (called PA-MWSED) and is 
optimized with the sub-gradient method. The second is based on a generalized MWSED (called 
PA-GMWSED) and is optimized with the Simplex method after the optimization is re-cast as a linear 
programming problem. Generally speaking, PA-MWSED has a better performance than PA-GMWSED but 
requires a higher complexity. Numerical results show that both of the proposed methods outperform the equal 
gain power allocation with large margins.

achieved by first obtaining BER at the destination, followed by an exhaustive search of the optimal power 
allocation. Unfortunately, such an approach is not practical because the true BER is very difficult to obtain if 
not impossible for a coded system and all possible allocations have to be examined. In this paper, two 
low-complexity power allocation methods are proposed. The first employs a cost function based on the 
minimum weighted squared-Euclidean distance (MWSED), which is shown to be convex and can be 
optimized with the sub-gradient method [19]. The second employs a cost function based on a generalized 
MWSED (GMWSED) to further reduce complexity. The optimization is done with the Simplex method [20] 
after the problem is re-cast as a linear programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed 
methods significantly outperform the equal gain power allocation. In addition, it was shown in [25] that the 
considered cooperative BICM system with DRF relaying achieves full diversity order.  
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system model, and Section 
III analyzes BER at the destination. In Section IV, the proposed power allocation methods are introduced. 
Simulation results and complexity comparisons are given in Section V, followed by conclusions in Section VI. 
II.   SYSTEM MODELS 
As is shown in Fig. 1, we consider a cooperative relaying network with one source, R  relays and one 
destination, which are indexed by 0, 1, ..., R , and 1R , respectively. Each node is equipped with one 
antenna and operates in the half-duplexing manner, implying that it cannot transmit and receive 
simultaneously. The channel gain between nodes i  and j  is denoted by ,i jh  which, in a block fading 
environment, remains unchanged over the transmission of a packet. Perfect CSI of 0, jh  is assumed to be 
known at the relay j , and perfect 0, 1Rh  , 0, jh  and , 1j Rh  , 1, 2,  ...,j R  are known at the destination and 
the power allocation unit. Since every link remains unchanged over the transmission of a packet, it can be 
treated as an AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channel from the power allocation perspective. Note that 
power allocation can be done either at source or destination depending on the required signaling overhead and 
where the complexity of power allocation is to be placed. From the signaling overhead aspect, allocation at 
destination seems favorable because only the CSIs of the source-to-relay links have to be reported to the 
destination.  
In the considered DRF relaying, transmission of a packet is divided into two phases. At phase-I, the 
source broadcasts the packet to all relays and the destination. If a relay decodes correctly, aided by a cyclic 
redundancy check (CRC), it re-encodes, remaps and forwards the packet to the destination at phase-II; 
otherwise, the relay keeps silence. The transmissions of relays are through orthogonal channels with the 
transmit power determined by the power allocation unit. At the destination, the received signals from phase-I 
and phase-II are combined and decoded jointly.  
 BICM is employed at all nodes. At the source, an information bit sequence b  of length K  is encoded 
by a channel encoder to a coded sequence c  of length N  and then interleaved by an interleaver  . The 
resulting binary sequence  v c  is successively partitioned into groups of m  bits, called the labels. The 
k -th label of v , denoted by kv , is then mapped to a complex symbol 
(0)
kx  in the constellation  ,

In this section, the BER performance is analyzed, and the new power allocation methods will be discussed in 
the next section.  
Let ,b jp  and ,f jp  denote BER and PER (packet error rate) at node j , respectively. Then, BER at the 
destination , 1b Rp   is evaluated by

where t  is the step size at the t -th iteration and   is the Euclidean projection on the feasible set of α . 
Some example performances of PA-MWSED will be provided in Section V. 
B. PA-GMWSED 
In PA-MWSED,  G α  needs to be evaluated repeatedly (according to (24) and (25)) in each iteration 
when the sub-gradient method is carried out, and there are total of 2R   ’s (each has different 
   I f jjg KW d g  ) needed to be included in the evaluation of  G α  in (20). As a consequence, 
PA-MWSED can be quite complex in some cases. In this subsection, the method of PA-GMWSED is 
proposed to further reduce the complexity of power allocation. The performance and complexity of 
PA-MWSED and PA-GMWSED will be compared in Section V for some examples. 
 The first idea in the development of PA-GMWSED is that instead of minimizing  G α  in (20), an α  
is searched to minimize   

Note that (i)  ln A α  does not change with 0TP N , (ii)   ln B α  as 0TP N  , and (iii) 
 ln A α  as 0 0   for R  . Using a very small 0 , however, is impractical because the source 
power will be too small to activate any relay in this case. Therefore, in practical systems, 
   ln lnA B α α  is dominated by  ln B α  at high SNRs, and it can be employed in search for good α  
with a reduced complexity.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
A. Power Allocations and BER Performances 
In this subsection, numerical results are given to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In all 
example systems, the channel code is the 1/2 convolutional code with the generator matrix 
 2 21 ,1D D D   , which has ( ) 1I fW d  , the interleaver is S-random with length 6144 and depth 20, and 
the constellation is 16-QAM. Equations (2) and (4) are used to evaluate the LLRs at relays and destination, 
respectively. The BCJR [23] decoders are employed in all receiving nodes.  
Figure 4 shows the power allocation results with PA-MWSED and PA-GMWSED for System-1, where 
1R  , (0) G  , 
(1)
A  , 
2
0,1 5h   and 
2 2
0,2 1,2 1h h  . For comparison, the power allocation, denoted 
by PA-UB, which is to minimize the BER bound in (5) and (6) (through exhaustive search) is also included. 
As is shown, for 0 1bE N  dB, all power is allocated to the source in all three methods; as the SNR increases, 
the allocated source power of PA-MWSED and PA-GMWSED are close with PA-MWSED slightly lower than 
PA-GMWSED, whereas PA-UB tends to allocate more power to source than the others. When 0 12bE N  dB, 
PA-MWSED and PA-GMWSED have the same power allocation at 0 0.5   (as predicted in Fig. 3 with 
1 2  ), which is achieved by PA-UB at 0 21bE N  . The BER performance of the system is given in Fig. 5. 
The proposed methods achieve almost the same BER performance and outperform PA-EG by at all ranges of 
SNRs. In particular, 0.5 dB gain is observed at BER of 
510 . Somewhat surprising, the proposed methods 
also outperform PA-UB: around 0.2 dB at BER of 
510 . The reason is that the union bound in Eq. (6) is 
usually quite loose at the low-to-medium SNR range (refer to Fig. 11 in [9]) and that makes PA-UB tend to 
allocate more power to the source as shown in Fig. 4. This misplace of power results in loss in BER 
performance.   
The power allocation results for System-2 are also plotted in Fig. 4, where 1R  , (0) (1) G    , 
2
0,1 5h  , 
2
0,2 1h   and 
2
1,2 10h  . Similarly, both the proposed methods allocate all power to the source 
when 0 1bE N   dB. As SNR increases, the allocated source power with PA-MWSED decreases much faster 
than that with PA-GMWSED. For 0 25bE N  dB, both methods allocate the same power to the source at 
about 0 0.67  . Figure 6 shows the BER performance. As is seen, PA-MWSED achieves the best 
performance at all ranges of SNRs, followed by PA-GMWSED and PA-EG. At BER of 
510 , PA-MWSED 
has about 1.8 dB gain over PA-EG, and PA-GMWSED has about 1 dB over PA-EG. 
Figure 7 shows the power allocation results for System-3, where 2R  , (0) G  ,

2

2
1,3 1h , and 
2
2,3 2h . The two relays have different qualities of the 
source-relay and relay-destination links and different mappers. Since 
2 2
0,1 0,2h h , relay 1 is more likely to 
have a correct decoding at low SNRs than relay 2. Therefore, each the power allocation method starts to 
allocate non-zero 1  at the SNR earlier than that of 2 . The BER performance is given in Fig. 8, where

can be proved to be true by evaluating the first and second derivatives of h  w.r.t. 1q  and 2q . Now consider 
the convexity of 1q  and 2q . According to [24], a function   S T α  is convex if S  is convex 
non-increasing and T  is concave. Define   32 21

   合作式中繼(cooperative relaying)技術是下世代行動通訊系統不可或缺的關鍵技
術；在系統網路層，中繼站技術可消除傳統行動通訊系統之室外涵蓋破洞(coverage 
holes)、增加系統容量、擴增基地台的涵蓋區域(coverage area)、提高在細胞邊緣(cell 
edge)使用者的傳輸率，因而提供較均勻的傳輸率涵蓋(uniform data rate coverage)，
另外，在上鏈路(uplink)則可降低行動台的傳送功率，減低細胞內(intra-cell)及細胞間
(inter-cell)之干擾，進而提升系統容量。在鏈路(link)層，使用者藉由中繼站可形成一
虛擬陣列天線(virtual antenna array)，因此提升鏈路分集(diversity)的維度(order)，
可提升鏈路品質(錯誤率、鏈路容量、中斷機率等)以及使用者的傳輸率，另一方面，由於
中繼站並非緊鄰使用者，中繼站所形成之虛擬陣列天線亦可克服遮蔽(shadowing)效應，
能更進一步改善系統之涵蓋率與提高整體系統的容量。 
本研究針對使用 BICM (bit-interleaved coded modulation)之合作式中繼系統的功率分
配議題進行探討，提出兩種新型之功率分配方法，相較於等功率方法，新提出之功率分配
方法具較佳錯誤率品質，方法亦相當簡單，實用性高。
