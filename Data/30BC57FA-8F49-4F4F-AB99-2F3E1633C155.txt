II. Introduction 
Modern CNC (Computer Numerical 
Control) machines not only provide 
linear/circular interpolations, but also offer 
parametric interpolations for curves such as 
Bezier, B-spline, and NURBS [1,2] curves. 
Some researches [3,4] have shown that 
parametric interpolations can reduce feedrate 
fluctuations and chord errors and shorten 
machining time in comparison with 
linear/circular interpolations.  
Many interpolation methods for 
parametric curves have been developed. 
Shpitalni et al. 錯誤! 找不到參照來源。 
developed a parametric curve interpolator 
using a Taylor series expansion algorithm. 
Zhang and Greenway [6] utilized the 
algorithm for NURBS interpolation and 
applied it to a six-axis robot. Chou and Yang 
[7] applied the parameter curve interpolation 
method to five-axes CNC machining and 
CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machines) 
systems. It can be shown that large chord 
errors might occur at sharp corners if a 
constant feedrate profile is used. To solve this 
problem, Yeh and Hsu [8] proposed an 
adaptive-feedrate interpolation algorithm. The 
feedrate was adjusted based on the curvatures 
and confined chord errors. Tikhon et al. [9] 
employed the adaptive feedrate algorithm, 
taking into consideration the constant material 
removal rate (MRR) to improve machining 
accuracy. Since this algorithm does not 
consider feedrate fluctuation, the acc/dec and 
jerk might be beyond the limits if the 
curvature of a curve changes abruptly. 
To overcome the acc/dec and jerk 
problems, Yong and Narayanaswami [10] 
proposed offline detection of sharp corners 
based on chord error information. The fine 
acc/dec feedrate profile was planned around 
the corner area, but the jerk limit was not 
considered in the algorithm. Jerk-limited 
feedrate planning was explicitly included in 
[11,12]. Liu et al. [13] developed an algorithm 
that integrated look-ahead, jerk-limited 
trajectory planning techniques to reduce 
velocity and acceleration fluctuations. Tsai et 
al. [14] applied a hybrid digital convolution 
technique to develop a look-ahead scheme 
that smoothes the feedrates between the joint 
of two curves. However, the algorithm was 
 4
implementation. 
When NURBS interpolation is performed, 
the feedrate )( kuV  in Eq. (8) should be 
determined first.  Most of the interpolation 
algorithms take into account geometric errors, 
such as chord errors, in determining the 
feedrate [8-17]. However, servo errors can 
only be compensated implicitly by 
constraining the feedrate, the acc/dec, and the 
jerk. To include servo errors in the design 
process, dynamic models should be 
developed. 
 
VI. DEVELOPMENT of a CONTOUR 
ERROR EQUATION 
In this section, a general dynamic model 
is given for an AC servo control system. The 
system parameters are as listed in Table I 
unless stated otherwise.  
4.1 General AC servo control system model 
The servo system shown in Fig. 2 
represents a dynamic model of a servo system 
which includes position, velocity loops, and a 
velocity feedforward path. The parameters a  
and b  in the block diagram were estimated 
by exciting the motor using a linear 
sweep-frequency signal set within the range 
0.1 to 500 Hz. The signal from the linear scale 
mounted in the X-Y stage was recorded, and 
the transfer function of the open loop system 
was identified using the ETFE (empirical 
transfer function estimate) method [19,20]. 
The parameters vpK  and iT  in the velocity 
loop were designed by setting the damping 
ratio and bandwidth of the closed-loop 
transfer function, which were given the values 
1.0 and 80 Hz, respectively. The position 
proportional gain ppK  in the position loop 
was determined based on the designed 
bandwidth of the position closed-loop transfer 
function, which was set to 40 Hz. The vffK  
was designed to increase the bandwidth of the 
servo control system. The first order low-pass 
filter with bandwidth nω  filters high 
frequency components of the commands. 
The closed-loop transfer function of the 
servo control system for each axis shown in 
Fig. 2 is given by

Equation (11) might not be suitable for 
interpolators which use feedrates as design 
parameters. To cope with the interpolation 
process, the second order approximation of 
the position command )(kr  for each axis is 
given as:

where )(kv  and )(ka  are the axial velocity 
and acceleration of the interpolator. The 
relation between )(kv  and )k(a  is 
expressed as:  
sT)k(a)1k(v)k(v +−=    (13) 
By taking the z-transform on both sides of Eq. 
(12) and (13), we get the relation between 
)(zR  and )(zV  as follows:

one can imagine that a tool is moving around 
the trident curve, shown in Fig. 1, under 
different feedrates. When the given feedrate 
(the feedrate command in a NC block) is high, 
the points A, B, C, D, and E in Fig. 1 can all 
be identified as sharp corners, and the 
feedrates at these points should be reduced 
such that contour accuracy can be maintained. 
However, as the given feedrate decreases to a 
lower value, the tool passes the points B and 
D slowly, and contour errors might still be 
within the specified accuracy without a 
reduction of the given feedrate. In such a case, 
points B and D need not be regarded as sharp 
corners. Based on this observation, the second 
criterion in identifying a sharp corner is that 
the curvature of a sharp corner should exceed 
the threshold value thκ , which is defined as:  
2
max
max
th
V
A=κ    (21) 
where maxA  is the maximum acceleration 
limit and maxV  is the given feedrate in the NC 
block. In other words, the second criterion 
examines whether the centripetal 
accelerations of the local max/min points 
exceed the maximum acceleration limit. If this 
condition is satisfied, the point is identified as 
a sharp corner, and the feedrate at that point 
should be reduced.  
A butterfly curve shown in Fig. 5 is used to 
further illustrate the concept. The curvatures 
for the butterfly curve are shown in Fig. 6. It 
is found that the number of points satisfying 
the first criterion is equal to 73, shown in Fig. 
6 (a). When the given feedrate is reduced to 
3500 mm/min, 11 sharp corners are detected, 
as shown in Fig. 6 (b). As the feedrate is 
increased to 5000 mm/min, 14 sharp corners 
are detected, as shown in Fig. 6 (c). 
Furthermore, when the given feedrate is 
increased to 7000 mm/min, 24 sharp corners 
represented by the characters A to X are 
identified in Fig. 6 (d). The selection of sharp 
corners that are dependent on the given 
feedrate introduces the dynamics effects into 
the interpolation process.  
After the sharp corners are obtained, the 
curve can be divided into small segments. For 
example, the trident curve is divided into 
segments OA , AB , BC , CD , DE  and 
EO , as shown in Fig. 1. The length of each 
segment is computed by applying the adaptive 
Simpson’s method [23]. The length of each 
segment msegL  is calculated using the 
following equations:  
∫ ′= end
str
u
u
m
seg du)u(CL       (22) 
where m is the index of each segment and 
endstr uu /  are the start/end interpolation 
parameters of the thm  segment. The length 
information will be provided to the 
jerk-limited module, which is presented next.   
 
5.3. The Jerk-limited Module  
The first task of the jerk-limited module 
is to obtain the feedrate )( kuV  at the sharp 
corners. To achieve this task, the proposed 
algorithm combines the adaptive-feedrate 
interpolation scheme [8] with the 
curvature-based feedrate interpolation 
algorithm [17]. The adaptive-feedrate 
algorithm can ensure that chord errors are 
bounded, and the curvature-feedrate algorithm 
adjusts the feedrate based on the curvature 
information. The algorithm for determining 
the feedrate )( k
m
sp uV  at the sharp corners is 
given as:  { })u(V),u(Vmin)u(V kcfkafkmsp =  (23) 
where )( kaf uV  and )( kcf uV  are given as 
follows:  
    2
ks
kaf )u(
2
T
2)u(V δκ
δ −=         (24) 
    max
k
kcf V)u(
)u(V κκ
κ
+=     (25) 
Here, afV , cfV , maxV  are the 
adaptive-feedrate, the curvature-feedrate, and 
the feedrate command, respectively. δ  and 
κ  are the chord tolerance and the curvature 
of a NURBS curve, respectively. κ  
maintains the derivative continuity of the 
curvature-feedrate in Eq. (25). The 
adaptive-feedrate ensures that the chord errors 
at the corner are bounded by the chord 
tolerance.  
After the feedrate at the sharp corners is 
obtained, the second task of the jerk-limited 
module is to plan the feedrate profile of each 
segment such that the constraints of the 
feedrate, acc/dec, and jerk limits are satisfied. 
 8
curvature-feedrate interpolations result in high 
acceleration and jerk because the feedrates 
cannot be reduced gradually without the 
look-ahead function. The proposed ILD 
interpolation with its look-ahead capability 
obtains smooth acceleration and jerk profiles 
compared to the other two approaches. 
Figure 10 (f), (g) and (h) show that the 
x-axis, y-axis tracking errors and the contour 
errors of the ILD are smaller than those of the 
adaptive-feedrate and curvature-feedrate 
interpolations. The ILD modifies the feedrate 
profiles of the segments AB  and CD  as 
the contour errors of the jerk-limited design 
are over the maximum contour error maxε . 
The contour errors using the ILD approach 
within the segments AB  and CD  are near 
maxε , which is set to 10 mμ .   
Because the calculated contour errors 
listed in Table III using Equation (18) are 
estimated values, the actual contour errors 
might be different from the calculated values. 
To compare the differences, a numerical 
method was applied to compute the actual 
contour errors for the trident curves. Assume 
that the path command and the actual position 
at 1tt =  are at point A and point B, 
respectively. The numerical method searches 
for point C on the path command where line 
BC  is perpendicular to the tangent of the 
path command at point C, as shown in Fig. 3. 
The actual contour error is defined as the 
length of line BC . It is found that the 
maximum value between the estimated and 
the actual errors is only 2um when the 
feedrate is equal to 3500 mm/min. The results 
demonstrate the feasibility of using Eq. (18) 
for real-time estimation of contour errors. 
 
6.2 Experimental Results 
Figure 11 shows the hardware setup, 
which includes an X-Y table driven by two AC 
servomotors, for the experiments. The built-in 
incremental encoders were used for velocity 
feedback. The resolution of the encoder is 
1000 pulses/rev. The linear scale mounted on 
the X-Y table is used for position feedback, 
and the resolution is 1 mμ . The PC interface 
utilized a D/A card and an encoder card to 
send the control output (voltage command) 
and to receive the feedback signals. The 
interpolator and servo controller were 
implemented on a PC platform using a 
Pentium IV 1.4GHz CPU. 
To validate the hardware capability for 
real-time control, the software real-time 
extension (RTX) [25] is applied. The 
computing time of the proposed algorithm is 
shown in Table IV. Here the real-time 
constraints of the look-ahead function and the 
motion controller are set to 10ms and 0.5ms.   
This shows that the ILD algorithm can be 
implemented with the current computational 
capability. 
The trident curve is tested under feedrate 
commands equal to 3500, 5000 and 7000 
mm/min. The contour error comparisons 
among the adaptive-feedrate, 
curvature-feedrate, and the ILD algorithms 
are shown in Fig. 12. The statistical data are 
summarized in Table V. It is clear that the 
proposed ILD achieves the best contour 
performances. The adaptive-feedrate 
algorithm, which only constrains chord errors, 
can cause large contour errors at the corners A, 
C, and E, as shown in Fig. 12. The 
curvature-feedrate reduces the feedrates at the 
corners A to E. However, the jerk limits are 
not satisfied, as shown in Fig. 10 (e). The ILD 
detects the sharp corners in advance, and thus 
a smoother feedrate profile can be planned to 
satisfy the constraints of the acc/dec and jerk. 
Table V shows that the ILD can reduce the 
maximum contour error by more than 90.65% 
and 69.04% compared to those of the 
adaptive-feedrate and curvature-based 
feedrate algorithm, respectively.  
To further illustrate the merits of the ILD, 
the butterfly contour shown in Fig. 5 is tested. 
For the maximum feedrate maxV  equal to 
7000 mm/min, the ILD detects 24 sharp 
corners marked as A to X, as shown in Fig. 6 
(d). The curve is divided into 25 segments, 
and the jerk-limited module plans a smooth 
trajectory for each segment. The dynamics 
module further modifies the feedrate of each 
segment, such as HI  ,QR , etc., by utilizing 
the flowchart shown in Fig. 8. The feedrate 
and curvature profiles are shown in Fig. 13. 
Comparisons of contour errors among the 
adaptive-feedrate, curvature-feedrate, and the

algorithms can be validated in real-time 
machining.

ABSTRACT  
 
A three-axis nano-positioning device is designed in the lab which consists of an X-Y table and 
a rotational stage on the top of the X-Y table. Each stage is actuated by a piezoactuator and the 
motion is sensed by laser displacement sensors and CCD camera. The dynamic models are 
developed using the Lagrange approach and analyzed through simulation. Due to install and 
fabrication errors, the dynamics of the X-Y table are coupled and thus a MIMO controller is 
developed to eliminate the coupling effects. The design process of the robust controller consists of 
two stages. First, the robust H∞ controller with the given specification is developed with different 
payloads. The H∞ controller is then reshaped by using the quantitative feedback theory (QFT). It is 
found that the noise effects and control efforts can be reduced significantly after applying the loop 
shaping of the QFT. The coupling of the X and Y axes is also eliminated.  The simulation and 
experimental results show that the rise time of the design stage is about 0.1 sec for a 20 um input. 
The positioning accuracy it can achieve is within 1um.  
 
Keywords: Robust H∞ control, MIMO system, QFT controller  
 
INTRODUCTION   
 
Due to the highly requirement on the market of the computer, LCD monitor and LCD TV, the 
demand on TFT-LCD has grown dramatically. The manufacturing process moves from the 
conventional injected process to the newly developed process called one drop filling (ODF). As 
shown in Fig. 1, the ODF process can increase the productivity of the TFT-LCD. In the process, the 
liquid crystal is first dropped on the first substrate where the glue is put on the perimeter of the 
substrate.  Then the second substrate is then bonded on the first substrate in the vacuum chamber 
with E-chucks holding the second substrate. This assembly requires the high precision alignment 
with the first and the second substrate. To ensure the accuracy of the assembly, the alignment is 
usually done with a highly precision platform and video cameras are used as the sensors to align 
the mark on the first and second substrate.  
 As compared to the mechanism for the alignment such as gear and ball-screw with the motors, 
piezoelectric actuators have the advantages such as high forces output, quick response, high 
positioning resolution and without considering friction effects. In this paper, we design a 
nano-positioning stage of the 3 DOFs (X, Y, θ), the lower substrate such that the high precision can 
be achieved with the stage. Furthermore, the coupling of the X and Y axis is solved by the control 
methodology.

The multiplicative uncertainty is used to model the system, and the overall system with the 
controller design is shown in Fig. 6. Here the coupling is treated as the disturbance input to the 
system.

   Here the weighting function on the system is chosen as W1x and W1y to reduce the tracking 
errors. The system uncertainties are covered by the weighted function W2xx and W2yy. By using 
the linear fractional transformation (LFT), the system can be represented as a standard form given 
as Fig. 7 [1-2].

  Equation (4) represents the performance bound while Eq. (5) represents the system 
robustness for the gain and phase margin. System uncertainties are included in the egg-like bound.  
  In this paper, the H∞ controller is designed first to obtain the controller since the time domain 
approach can achieve a systematic controller for the MIMO system. Then the QFT controller is 
applied to further loop shape the controller such that the high frequency noise can be reduced [6]. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
To evaluate the hybrid design of the controller, step response of the stage is tested [7]. The first 
step is design the H∞ controller for the plant with different loading condition. The results are 
shown in Fig. 10. It is shown that the controller gain is high as the frequency is higher than 1000 
rad/sec. The high frequency gain might enlarge the noise effect.

  Using the H∞ controller as the design basis, one can reshape the controller via the QFT 
technique. The Nichols chart is shown in Fig. 11. It is shown that the high frequency gain is must 
reduced as shown in Fig. 12.

CONCLUSIONS 
A three-axis nano-positioning device is designed to simulate the positioning for the TFT-LCD 
alignment system. The device is actuated by piezoactuators and the motion is sensed by laser 
displacement sensors and CCD camera. Due to installation and fabrication errors, the dynamics of 
the X-Y table are coupled and thus a MIMO controller is developed to eliminate the coupling 
effects. Here we first proposed a robust H∞ controller with the given specification is developed 
with different payloads. The H∞ controller is then reshaped by using the quantitative feedback 
theory (QFT). It is found that the noise effects and control efforts can be reduced significantly after 
applying the loop shaping of the QFT. The experimental results show that the rise time of the 
design stage is about 0.1 sec for a 20 um input. The positioning accuracy it can achieve is within 
1um.
