High Speed AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for MMIC and OEICApplication(3/3) 
1. Introduction: 
The GaN based materials such as GaN, and AlGaN have been widely utilized in the blue 
LED, UV LED, white LED, and Blue LED. Beside the optical application, the GaN based 
electronic device have also been developed and discussed. Owing to the excellent electronic 
properties such as high electron mobility (1000 ~ 1300 cm2/Vs), high saturation electron velocity 
(1.8x107 cm/s), wide bandgap (3.39 eV), and high breakdown electric filed (3 MV/cm), GaN 
transistors were developed in order to instead of the traditional III-V compound semiconductor 
transistor for the communication filed. Even though there are a lot of issues in GaN HEMTs 
including pizeo-electronic property, unstable surface state, and high lattice mismatch between 
substrate and expitaxy layers, the research of GaN HEMTs is hot and continuing.  
In 1st year project, high quality AlGaN/GaN HEMTs expitaxy layers will be grown on the 
sapphire substrate, and the gate length of 0.25 micron by using electron beam lithography will be 
applied into the fabrication of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Then the measurement and modeling will be 
done for the device characterization. Moreover, the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs will be combined with 
the flip chip technology to realize the microwave integrated circuit (MIC) such as amplifier and 
power amplifier.  
Because of the low thermal conductivity of conventional sapphire substrate under a very 
high dc power operation, the heating effect becomes a very serious problem to limit the device 
performance, especially for the device output power and power added efficiency (PAE). The 
heating effect will degrade the electron velocity, the device contact resistance, and the leakage 
current [5-7]. In 2nd year project, we demonstrate a process flow for fabricating the GaN power 
device with gate width form 200 µm to 1800 µm, and the self-heating effect on device with larger 
gate width can be observed. For the discussion of device layout versus heating effect, some report 
has demonstrated an modification of device layout such as the distance of gate pitch to obtain a 
lower thermal resistance by selecting a larger gate pitch distance in the device [8-10]. In this 
study, we fabricated three kinds of 1.8 mm gate width power devices with various gate pitch 
including 35 μm, 45 μm, and 55 μm distance. 
On the other hand, In order to achieve a enhancement of device breakdown performance, 
the filed plate technology is commonly used in the GaN HEMT device [11]. We applied the filed 
plate technology not only on GaN HEMTs [12-13] but also on Schottky diodes for the application 
of DC/DC converter. Additionally, the detail analysis of parasitic capacitance in the field plate 
GaN HEMTs by using various layouts was discussed. Then a better layout for providing a 
enhancement of breakdown performance and owing lower parasitic capacitance can be got. 
Finally, the combination of GaN/AlGaN HEMT and Schottky diode was fabricated as a cell for 
the demonstrating of boost converter. 
The III–V nitride semiconductors have a wurtzite crystal structure and a direct energy 
bandgap. At room temperature, the energy bandgap of AlInGaN varies from 0.78 to 6.2 eV. 
Therefore, III–V nitrides are useful for light emitters and photodetectors (PDs) in blue and green

2.2 The fabrication of GaN HEMT: 
 The Ti/Al/Ni/Au is widely utilized in the ohmic contact process on n-type GaN. In order to 
get the better contact resistance, the testing about the ratio of Ti/Al and annealing temperature had 
been done, and the results is shown in the Fig.2 (a). The best condition of ohmic contact process 
on the n-type GaN is using Ti/Al/Ni/Au 25/125/45/55 nm metals at 800 degree for 30 sec in a N2 
ambient, and the contact resistance is about 0.4 ohm-mm. For the mesa etching process, the 
Ar/Cl2 mixed RIE dry etching was used with an etching rate of 100nm for GaN, and the etching 
profile is shown in the Fig.2 (b). In order to enhance the device performance, the 0.2 micron 
T-shape gate and 2 micron drain-to-source spacing was realized, which are shown in the Fig. 3. 
The shorter gate length will result in the lower gate-to-source capacitance and higher average 
electron velocity. Additionally, the shorter drain-to-source spacing will also reduce the total 
electron transit time, and channel resistance in the device. Therefore, the higher current density, 
higher transconductance, and higher device speed will be expected.

the convention device, which is due to the enhancements of the fmax and output power density.

a Vds of 30 V, and the Ids was 25% of Ids, max. 
 
2.4 The discussion of gate-width versus device performance 
The dc performances of various gate width devices were shown in the Fig. 7, where the 
drain-to-source voltage (Vds) was sweep from 0 to 8 V, and the gate-to-source voltage (Vgs) was 
sweep from -4 to 0 V. It is obvious that the self-heating effect was more serious in the larger gate 
width device, where the negative resistance effect of I-V curve was obvious at high drain current 
and high drain voltage operation region. After calculating the current density of each kind gate 
width device, the current density was seriously decreased form 850 mA/mm of 50 μm gate width 
device to 450 mA/mm of 1800 μm gate width device. The reason of current density reduction 
could be attributed to the more serious heating effect caused by the larger dc power consumption 
in the large gate width power device.

2.5 The field plate on Schottky diode and DC/DC converter  
On the other hand, the field plate technology can also be applied into the Schottky diode. The 
field plate was connected with the circular Schottky metal and placed over the interjection of 
Schottky electrode, where the electric field was stronger and un-uniform. Additionally, the shape 
of ohmic metal near the interjection of Schottky metal was also a key parameter to affect the Vbr. 
In this study, we combine the GaN HEMT and GaN Schottky as a converter cell, to demonstrate a 
boost converter. The passive components such as inductor and capacitor were connected with cell 
by using bonding wires. The measure result of boost converter was shown in Fig. 10, where the 
ideal dc voltage gain was 2. The lower voltage gain in the higher voltage region was owing to the 
leakage current in the GaN HEMT device when the Vds was over 30 V.

2.7 The GaN/AlGaN HEMTs on Sapphire transferred substrate to Cu by LLO  
In 3rd year project, we make laser lift-off process by 248nm wavelength IX-100 KrF laser in 
NCU MOE lab. Laser pulses heat the surface between sapphire and GaN to 900℃. The GaN will 
decomposed to Ga metal and H2. Then the GaN HEMT will lift off from Sapphire successfully.

3. Conclusion 
The high selectivity RIE etching for the GaN HEMT recess process was completed. The 
selectivity between GaN and AlGaN was about 8, and the surface damage caused by the 
Ar/Cl2/CH4/O2 selective dry etching was lower than the traditional Ar/Cl2 dry etching. After 
comparing the un-recessed GaN HEMTs and recessed GaN HEMTs, the recessed GaN HEMTs 
demonstrated better current density, higher transconductance characteristics, higher fT, higher fmax, 
and higher output power density.  
In order to improve thermal effect of GaN HEMTs, we fabricated three kinds device with 
various gate pitches to observe dc I-V, and microwave power performance on the device 
performance. The device with larger gate pitch demonstrated a higher current density and a better 
microwave power performance even though the higher parasitic capacitance was also obtained 
simultaneously.  
For the dc/dc converter experiment, a field plate technology was simultaneously applied into 
the GaN HEMT and GaN Schottky diodes for the application of GaN dc/dc converter. By using a 
non-overlapping field plate structure, the device demonstrated a good enhancement of breakdown 
performance, and the parasitic capacitance will not be increased as much as overlapping field 
pate structure. Besides, the field plate technology can also obviously enhance the Vbr of GaN 
Schottky especially for the un-continued region in ohmic and Schottky metals.    
We have developed the 500nm wavelength metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photo 
detector using the InGaN as the absorption layer and GaN/AlGaN HEMT TIA to form the fully 
integrated OEIC. On the other hand, in order to improve the poor thermal conductivity of 
Sapphire, we lifted off AlGaN/GaN HEMTs by 248nm KrF UV laser in NCU and transferred 
them to other substrate of high thermal conductivity. We have fabricated 0.3μm gate-length 
AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on Sapphire and transferred them to Cu substrate; the microwave and DC 
performance both have been improved: the gm MAX increases 4.4% and improvement of fT is 
5.4%.

1. DUV LED chip either in 365nm or 405 nm is still debating. Japanese 
prefers the 405 nm since this is less harmful to human body. In addition, 
Mitsubishi has announced good phosphurs solution in this wavelength. 
2. Vertical LEDs receives a substantial attention.  
3. UCSB is now working on the M-plane to grow the non-polar GaN layer, 
where they give up to grow on the A-plane. They aslo find out the with the 
QW structure, indeed the output light is partially polarized. The reason is 
not clear yet.  
4. Photonic crystal for extracting more light and output of polarized light is 
promising.  
5. In fact, TV makers are not so concerned with the no fan BLU or the thinner 
BLU, which is really embrassing me after our presentation. Local dimming 
using the LED is their mostly wanted. Samsung and LG has demonstrated 
the local dimming LED/LCD TV in the exhibition hall.  
6. LED package for BLU is important, since the lifetime so far after the 
package is less than the CCFL.  
7. Using the high power or low power LED chip for BLU is still under the 
debating. Low power chip has the advantages of better mixing quality and 
optical efficiency; however the cost is higher, since more lamps are 
needed.  
8. Notebook is more promising for the LED BLU application, as compared to

Abstract —A phase-locked loop (PLL) MMIC based on a 
ring-type injection-locked frequency divider (RILFD) and a 
cascode-type voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) has been 
manufactured by using 0.5 µm enhanced/depletion mode (E/D) 
GaAs pHEMTs for Ka-band communications. In this circuit, the 
15 GHz cascode oscillator including the 2nd harmonic cascode 
buffer amplifier was designed to generate a 30 GHz output signal. 
To synchronize the oscillation signal with the input reference 
signal, the wide locking-range divided-by-four RILFD using 
injection-locked technique and the cascode mixer to be a phase 
detector were used with a reference signal of 3.75 GHz. With a 
RC low-pass filter and a dc amplifier based on the E/D-mode 
inverter circuit, the loop gain and the output phase noise can be 
further improved. The measured result of the locking range is 
about 400 MHz near 30 GHz and the output phase noise is about 
-116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset under a 2 V dc supply with 80 mW 
power consumption.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Millimeter-wave wireless applications have been rapidly 
developed in recent years applying to the automotive radars 
and the unlicensed local area network [1,2]. In order to reduce 
the cost and the package issues, it is becoming much more 
important that a highly monolithic integrated circuit applied in 
the transmitter or the receiver. The PLL is also the essential 
circuit for generating a reference frequency signal. In the 
conventional PLL design, the divider can be implemented 
either by the dynamic type or the static type. However, those 
circuits have a high design complexity due to the large 
number of transistors. That also increases the power 
consumption especially operating at millimeter-wave band. 
Hence, the injection-locked technique was proposed to be a 
frequency divider which is called “injection-locked frequency 
divider” (ILFD) or prescalar to replace the conventional 
dividers [3-6]. It has the characteristics of a low dc power and 
a low phase noise. To avoid the large circuit layout size used 
in the chip, the ring-type ILFD (RILFD) was also proposed 
for low power applications [7,8]. The E/D-pHEMT process 
has been used to fabricate the integrated PLL circuits because 
of the advantage of the single bias design [9,10]. In this report, 
we used the 0.5 µm E/D-mode pHEMT technology to further 
realize a low-power 30 GHz single-chip PLL using the 
RILFD with high-order division ratio.

function circuits were design by using 0.5 µm E/D-mode 
pHEMTs. The E-mode and D-mode devices have the 
threshold voltages of 0.3 V and -1.2 V and have the 
transconductances of 570 mS/mm and 500 mS/mm. The

output frequency range is between 29.3 GHz and 31.4 GHz in 
different biases of VG1,1. The maximum oscillator gain is 2.75 
GHz/V while the VG1,1 was set to be 0.8 V. Based on this 
tuning characteristic, the output oscillation frequency can be 
first determined before operating in locking state. 
Fig. 7 shows the locking range of the RILFD depending on 
the bias of Vosc (Fig. 4) in different injected powers. Owing to 
the locking range relies upon the nonlinear characteristics 
inside the injector and the RILFD, setting the Vosc to be 0.5 V 
will enhance the range up to 2 GHz under a 6 dBm power 
injection. For the highest operation locking range in this PLL, 
the injection power of the 15 GHz signal was set to 6 dBm. 
Moreover, the dc power dissipation of the RILFD is 15 mW 
under a 1 V supply. 
In the measurement, the whole power consumption of the 
PLL circuit is 80 mW. The measured phase noise of the 30 
GHz free-running signal is about -95 dBc/Hz at an offset 
frequency of 1 MHz with an output power of -6 dBm. In the 
locking state, the output spectrum of the 30 GHz signal is 
shown in Fig. 8 (a). The phase noise presents a -102 dBc/Hz 
at 100 KHz and -116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz as exhibited in Fig. 8 
(b). Additionally, this PLL can be locked in a frequency range 
from 29.7 GHz to 30.1 GHz, corresponding to a hold-in range 
of 400 MHz. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
This study we demonstrate a 30 GHz single-chip integrated 
PLL circuit by using 0.5 µm E/D-mode pHEMT process. The

oscillator, ring-type injection-locked frequency divider, phase
