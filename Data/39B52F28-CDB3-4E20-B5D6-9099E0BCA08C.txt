and others). The analysis above always considers that the switchover from a standby to an
operational unit is perfect. However, this might be unrealistic. For example, a system with cold
standbys has the advantage of a zero failure rate, there may be also drawbacks, such as a higher
probability of switching failure and longer warm-up times. Lewis [14] first introduced the concept
of the standby switching failures in the reliability with standby system. Chung [15] has ever
provided the reliability of k active and s cold standbys with multiple repair facilities and multiple
critical and non-critical errors when the switching mechanism is subject to failure. He derived the
reliability function in terms of LST of system state probabilities, which is very complicated and is
generally unsuitable for computational purposes.
The concept of fuzzy reliability has been introduced and developed by several authors
(Onisawa [16] and Cai et al. [17], [18], [19], [20]). According to the studies by Cai et al. ([17], [18],
[19], [20]), various forms of fuzzy reliability theory can be considered by taking new assumptions,
such as the possibility assumption (possibility distribution) or the fuzzy-state assumption, in place
of the probability assumption (probability distribution) or the binary-state assumption. In Cai et al.
[17], the fuzzy system reliability was established based on the binary-state assumption and
possibility assumption. However in Cai et al. [18], the fuzzy system reliability was established
based on the three-state assumption and possibility assumption. In Cai et al. [19], the fuzzy system
reliability was developed based on the basis of fuzzy-state assumption and probability assumption.
Utkin ([21], [22]) discussed the fuzzy system reliability based on the binary-state assumption and
possibility assumption, and considered the fuzzy availability and unavailability and the fuzzy
operative availability and unavailability. Wu [23] proposed the fuzzy probability to discuss the
system reliability in which the functioning probability of each component in the system was
assumed as a nonnegative fuzzy number. Recently, Jiang and Chen [24] developed a computational
model of fuzzy reliability focusing on solving the engineering problems with random general stress
and fuzzy general strength.
Reported research has largely been concerned with obtaining measures of system effectiveness.
However, while these results can be useful in analysis and assist the decision process, there are very
few studies that establish a decision model which directly determines an optimum maintenance
strategy. de Almeida and Campello de Souza [7] constructed a decision model using a Bayesian
approach and selected utility functions. Their approach motivates us to develop an alternative
method to analyze repairable systems in which the uncertainty of the parameters is accounted for
using a fuzzy approach. Repairable systems formulated in this way have broader applications for
reliability engineers and management than conventional models.
In the literature described above, times to failure and times to repair are required to follow
certain possibility distributions or probability distributions with fixed parameters. However, in
many real-world applications, the distribution parameters may only be characterized subjectively;
that is, parameters of failure and repair patterns are frequently summarized with everyday language
descriptions of central tendencies, such as “the mean failure rate is approximately 3 per day”or“the
mean time between failures is approximately 8/24 day”, rather than with complete (exactly)
parameter patterns. The looseness with which the system measures are reported is revealing of the
uncertainty concerning these parameter patterns. And because the parameter patterns of
time-to-failure and time-to-repair are therefore possibilistic rather than deterministic, the reliability
(or availability) problem becomes one of decision making in the context of risk (see Holloway [25]).
To broaden applications of reliability and availability analysis in engineering (see Cleland and
Kocaoglu [26]), general science, and management (Holloway [25]), this article extends the
parameter distributions to fuzzy environments (see Zadeh [27]).
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a detailed model description and
introduces the reliability and availability characteristics of the repairable system. In Section 3, the
repairable system is extended to the fuzzy environment and membership functions for system

3. The fuzzy repairable system and membership functions
To extend the applicability of the repairable system, we allow for fuzzy specification of system
parameters. Suppose the failure rate of an operating unit , the failure rate of a standby unit ,
and the repair rate of a failed unit  are approximately known and can be represented by the fuzzy
sets ~ , ~ , and ~ , respectively. Let )(~ x , )(~ v , and )(~ y denote the membership
functions of ~ , ~ , and, ~ , respectively. We then have the following fuzzy sets:
 Xxxx  ))(,(~ ~ , (11a)
 Vvvv  ))(,(~ ~ , (11b)
 Yyyy  ))(,(~ ~ , (11c)
where X , V , and Y are the crisp universal sets of the failure rate of an operating unit, the failure
rate of an standby unit, and the repair rate of a failed unit.
Let ),,( yvxh denote the system characteristic of interest (e.g., MTTF or availability). Since
~ , ~ , and ~ are fuzzy numbers, )~,~,~( h is also a fuzzy number. Following Zadeh’s 
extension principle (see Zadeh [27] and Prade [28]), the membership function of the system

From the definitions of )( , )( , and )( in Eq. (14), )(x , )(v , and
)(y can be replaced by ],[ UL xxx  , ],[ UL vvv  , and ],[ UL yyy  , respectively. The
-cuts form a nested structure with respect to  (see Kaufmann [29] and Zimmermann [30]); i.e.,
given 10 12   , we have ],[],[ 2211
ULUL xxxx   , ],[],[ 2211
ULUL vvvv   , and
],[],[
2211
ULUL yyyy   . Therefore, the lower bounds (15a), (15c), and (15e) have the same smallest
element and the upper bounds (15b), (15d), and (15f) have the same largest element. To find the
membership function )(~ zT , it suffices to find the left and right shape functions of )(~ zT , which is
equivalent to finding the lower bound LT )( and upper bound
UT )( of the -cuts of T

can be rewritten as:

At least one of x , v , or y must hit the boundaries of their -cuts to satisfy  )(~ zT . This
model is a set of mathematical programs with boundary constraints and lends itself to the systematic
study of how the optimal solutions change with Lx ,
Ux ,
Lv,
Uv ,
Ly, and
Uy as  varies
over ( ]0,1 . The model is a special case of parametric NLPs (see Gal [31]).
The crisp intervals [ LT )( ,
UT )( ] obtained from Eq. (16) represents the -cuts of T
~ . Again,
by applying the results of Kaufmann [29] and Zimmermann [30] and convexity properties to T~ ,
we have LL TT
21
)()(   and UU TT 21 )()(   , where 10 12   . In other words,
LT )(
increases and UT )( decreases as  increases. Consequently, the membership function )(~ zT
can be found from Eq. (16).
If both LT )( and
UT )( in Eq. (16) are invertible with respect to , then a left shape
function 1])[()(  LTzL  and a right shape function 1])[()(  UTzR  can be derived, from which
the membership function )(~ zT is constructed:
8as shown in Figure 2. The overall shape turns out as expected.
Next, we perform -cuts of the failure rate of an operating unit, the failure rate of a standby
unit, and the repair rate of a failed unit and the fuzzy MTTF at eleven distinct  values: 0.0, 0.1,
0.2,…, 1.0. Crisp intervals for the fuzzy MTTF at different possibilistic  levels are presented in
Table 1. The fuzzy MTTF T~ has two characteristics to be noted. First, the support of T~ ranges
from 1.4391 to 9.0; this indicates that, though the MTTF is fuzzy, it is impossible for its values to
fall below 1.4391 or exceed 9.0. Second, the -cut at 1 contains the values from 2.4306 to
3.1127, which are the most possible values for the MTTF.

as shown in Figure 3. Table 2 reports -cuts of the failure rate of an operating unit, the failure rate
of a standby unit, and the repair rate of a failed unit and fuzzy availability for the same eleven
selected  values. From Table 2, for possibility level 1 , the range of the availability is
approximately [0.9467,0.9631], which indicates that it is definitely possible that the availability
falls in this interval, although it is imprecise. For possibility level 0 , the range of the
availability is approximately [0.8980,0.9887]. This indicates that the availability cannot exceed
0.9887 or fall below 0.8980.
6. Conclusions
This paper applies the concepts of -cuts and Zadeh’s extension principleto a repairable
system with two primary units and one standby unit and then constructs membership functions of
MTTF and availability using paired NLP models. Following the proposed approach, -cuts of the
membership functions are found and their corresponding interval limits inverted to attain explicit
closed-form expressions for the system characteristics. Even when the membership function
intervals cannot be inverted explicitly, system management or designers can specify the system
characteristics of interest, perform numerical calculations, examine the corresponding -cuts, and
use this information to develop or improve system processes.
For example, a manager may consider the costs related to a repairable system to decide the
optimal maintenance strategy; to do so, he or she can set the range of MTTF to be between 2.1543
and 3.6337 to reflect the desired repair rate of a failed unit and find that the corresponding  level
is 0.8 with Ly=7.8 and
Uy =9.2. In other words, the manager can determine that the repair rate of
a failed unit should be between 7.8 and 9.2. Similarly, a manager can set the range of availability to
