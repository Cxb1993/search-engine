a finite energy signal. The multiresolution 
nature of wavelets can detect edges at 
different scales, while conventional 
techniques lack this kind of ability. 
Wavelet transform also has the advantage 
of noise handling which is almost noise 
free when compared with other common 
edge detection methods. For this reason, 
this project proposed to use the wavelet 
modulus to replace the derivatives 
operator. The inverse problems for 
noiseless and noisy cases were both 
investigated. As the Bayesian MAP 
estimation technique is applied the 
superresolution reconstruction problem is 
cast into a functional optimization from 
which we derive an iterative gradient 
projection approach to obtain the solution.  
    The proposed wavelet modulus 
method was compared with the binear 
interpolation and the Bayesian MAP 
estimation using the conventional edge 
detector for both noiseless and noisy 
models. We calculated the PSNR trend of 
the reconstructed SR image as the number 
of iterations increases. The PSNR as well 
as the visual content of the reconstructed 
SR image for each of the above method 
were reported. The improvement of the 
proposed wavelet modulus method over 
others was quantitatively calculated. 
 
 
一. 緣由與目的  
A promising approach in signal 
processing is to generate a high-resolution 
image from a given low-resolution image 
[1, 22]. Such a resolution enhancement 
approach is called super resolution (SR). 
The major advantage of the signal 
processing approach is that it may cost 
less and the exiting low-resolution image 
can be reused.  
     A related problem to super 
resolution is image restoration, which is a 
well established area in image processing 
applications [10]. The goal of image 
restoration is to recover a degraded image, 
but it does not change the size of image 
[14], [24], [33]. In fact, restoration and 
super resolution are closely related 
theoretically, and super resolution can be 
considered as a second-generation 
problem of image restoration. 
    Another related problem to super 
resolution is image interpolation, such as 
zero-order hold method, bilinear and cubic 
B-spline interpolation techniques [13]. 
Although this field has been extensively 
studied, the high frequency information of 
an image can’t be generated from a low 
resolution image by interpolation. For this 
reason, image interpolation methods are 
not considered as super resolution 
techniques. 
    The superresolution problem can be 
reduced to estimate the high resolution 
image Z  given the low resolution image 
.Y The reconstruction problem of 
superresolution is a highly ill-posed 
problem since there may exist many 
solutions from the given data [1, 2]. In 
such case, the result can be significantly 
improved by exploiting a priori constraint. 
The Bayesian maximum a posteriori 
estimation is often used to well-pose the

where [ ]wρ ⋅  is the Huber function. 
[ , , ]Z w jΩ is a function of both 
high-resolution image Z  and the 
threshold parameter w  for the wavelet 
coefficient. Then the MAP estimate Zˆ  
can be found by minimizing the convex 
functional in Eq. (5) which subject to the 
constraints   
              .Y HZ=              (6) 
Where H is the HR to LR sampling matrix. 
We used an iterative gradient projection 
technique to solve the constrained 
problem [14]. Suppose the image vector is 
denoted as ( )nZ  for the n th iteration. 
The gradient of the convex functional is 
given by 
 
( ) ( ) , .n ng Z w⎡ ⎤= ∇Ω ⎣ ⎦             (7)                           
 
    Define a vector 
( )nd  as the 
projection of the negative gradient onto 
the tangent subspace defined by the 
constraints. The iteration is then 
determined as 
 
( 1) ( ) ( ) ( )n n n nZ Z dα+ = +           (8) 
                                          
The iterative algorithm to solve the 
constrained problem is given by 
1. Set 0n =  and construct an initial 
guess (0)Z (e.g., use a zero-order 
hold interpolation to the given image, 
Y , by a factor of p  in both 
directions.)                  
  2. Calculate the gradient of 
    ( ) ,nZ w⎡ ⎤Ω ⎣ ⎦ , ( )ng .       
  3. Compute ( )nd from ( )ng  
  4.If ( )nd ε<  is not satisfied, 
calculate ( )nα  and multiply by ( )nd  
then add to   ( )nZ  to generate the 
next estimate ( 1)nZ + , i.e. update the 
image vector by  
( 1) ( ) ( ) ( )n n n nZ Z dα+ = + . Set 
1n n= +  and return to step 2 for 
next iteration. 
   5. If ( )nd ε<  is satisfied, then stop   
     and output ( )ˆ nZ Z= . 
 
For the case when the given image is 
corrupted with i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the 
cost function will be modified as 
                
2[ , , ] [ , , ]M Z w j Y HZ Z w jλ λ= − + Ω  
                              (9) 
               
 
In this expression, [ , , ]Z w jΩ is the 
noiseless model and λ  is the smoothing 
parameter which controls the tradeoff 
between fidelity of the solution to the data 
and the smoothness measured 
by [ , , ]Z w jΩ . The iterative algorithm in 
this case becomes 
 
1. Set 0n =  and construct an initial 
guess (0)Z (e.g., use a zero-order 
hold interpolation to the given image, 
Y , by a factor of p  in both 
directions.)                  
  2. Compute the smoothing     
    parameter ( )nλ .
