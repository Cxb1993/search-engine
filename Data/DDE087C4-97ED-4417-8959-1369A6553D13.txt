and tibia, and astragalus. As shown in Fig. 1, the pelvis is 
the structure of the vertebrate skeleton supporting the 
lower limbs in humans, the femur is connected to the 
pelvis at the hip joint, and the tibia is connected to the 
femur at the knee joint and to the astragalus (not shown 
in Fig. 1) at the ankle joint. The coordinate system of a 
human can be described by three anatomically aligned 
axes: axis of superior/inferior (SI), axis of 
anterior/posterior (AP) and axis of medial/lateral (ML). 
The axes of SI and AP form the sagittal plane, on which 
the side view is projected. The axes of SI and ML form 
the frontal plane and axes of AP and ML form the 
transverse plane, on which the front view and top view 
are projected, respectively. The sagittal plane, frontal 
plane and transverse plane are referred to as the three 
cardinal planes of a human body.

As the lower limb in motion, rotation of the femur 
with respect to the pelvis at the hip joint and rotation of 
tibia with respect to the femur at the knee joint in the 
sagittal and frontal plane are shown in Figs. 1 (a) and (b), 
respectively. While the lower limb is in motion, the 
pelvis exhibit a complex motion with respect to the body 
trunk, where the rotation in the sagittal, frontal and 
transverse plane are shown in Figs. 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c), 
respectively. 
 
Simplification and assumption of the model. 
Normal walking can be divided into two phases: as 
the foot is in contact with the ground is referred to as the 
stance phase, while the foot swings in the air is referred 
to as the swing phase. According to the studies [10], 
during a full gait cycle, the hip extension/flexion and the 
knee extension/flexion in the sagittal plane are the major 
rotations at hip joint and knee joint, respectively, and the 
other rotations are comparatively insignificant. Hence,  
 
S1: The knee joint can be simplified as a revolute joint in 
the sagittal plane. 
 
According to Fig. 1, posterior/anterior tilt, up/down 
obliquity and medial/lateral rotation of the pelvis with 
respect to trunk can be observed. Since the rotation center 
of pelvis for posterior/anterior tilt is close to the hip joint 
in the sagittal plane, the displacement of the hip joint due 
to posterior/anterior tilt can be ignored. On the contrary, 
the displacement of the hip joint due to up/down 
obliquity and medial/lateral rotation of pelvis is 
significant because the distance between the rotation 
center of the pelvis and the hip joint is about half of the 
bifemoral breath of the pelvis. Hence, as the 
displacements of the hip joint along the SI and AP axes 
are substantial and can’t be ignored. Hence, 
 
S2: The displacement of the hip joint with respect to 
the trunk due to the rotation of the pelvis is considered 
only along the SI and the AP axes of the sagittal plane. 
With two translations and one rotation, the hip joint is 
considered as a planar joint. 
 
Kinematic model of human lower limb. 
According to S1 and S2, the cardinal motion plane of 
the lower limb during a full gait cycle is the sagittal plane. 
Hence, as shown in Fig. 2(a), a human lower limb is 
considered as a planar mechanism of three links with the 
hip joint as a planar pair with two-dof translation and 
one-dof rotation and with the knee joint as revolute joint 
with axis perpendicular to the sagittal plane. For the 
graph representation of the model as shown in Fig. 2(b), 
body trunk, femur and tibia are respectively represented 
by vertices and labeled with B, F and T, respectively. The 
planar pair at the hip joint is represented by a heavy edge 
and labeled with E, and the knee joint is represented by a 
double thin edge and labeled with R.

IV. Determination of lower limb orthosis based on the 
gravity-balance requirement of the system. 
In order for the gravity-balance of the human lower 
limb, the gravity-balancing technique is considered. 
Although a human lower limb is composed of bones, 
muscles and other soft tissues, for simplicity, the mass 
centers of thigh and shank are assumed to be fixed on the 
femur and tibia, respectively. Moreover, if the orthosis is 
connected to the mass center of the shank, the weight of 
the shank can be balanced by the orthosis, and the joint 
force and torque at the knee joint can be zeros at any 
configuration of the lower limb. Similarly, if the orthosis 
is connected to the mass center of the thigh, the weight of 
the human thigh can be balanced by the orthosis, and the 
joint force and torque at the hip joint can be zeros as well. 
Hence, as the orthosis is connected to both mass centers 
of the human shank and thigh, the lower limb orthosis 
can be treated as an open-loop mechanism.  
A number of approaches had been proposed for the 
gravity balance of planar mechanisms. Counter-weight 
method uses additional masses to counter-balance the 
weights of all links of the mechanism. However, since a 
heavy and cumbersome orthosis is not desired, the 
counter-weight method is not adopted. Some gravity-
balancing mechanisms were achieved by fitting spring 
elements between links of the mechanism and a set of 
moving base constituted of parallel auxiliary links, while 
some were achieved by fitting springs between the 
ground and the mass center of the system, traced by 
parallel auxiliary links [14]. However, since the 
techniques utilizing auxiliary links may induce motion 
interference and increase the weight and inertia of the 
system, such methods are also not adopted. Lin et al. [12] 
proposed a spring-only technique for the gravity balance 
of planar articulated mechanisms, which is used for the 
gravity balance of the orthosis mechanism. 
 
Formulation for the conservation of the potential 
energy of the system 
Referring to the planar n-link articulated linkage as 
shown in Fig. 4, the gravitational potential energy of the 
system can be expressed as 
n
g T
i 1
i im
=
-åU = G P   (6) 
where mi is the mass of link i, G is the free vector 
representing the gravitational acceleration, Pi is the 
position vector of the mass center of link i, mi, from the 
origin of the coordinate system. Since G and Pi can be 
further expressed, respectively, as

added. Moreover, for each fitted spring, four attachment 
point parameters of each fitted spring, such as ac, bc, αc 
and βc, and spring constant kc are required to be 
determined. In practice, since the selection of a spring 
with any arbitrary spring constant can be difficult, spring 
constants of all springs used for the balanced system are 
pre-determined. Thus, for each spring, only four design 
parameters are available. According to Eqs.(10), (11) and 
(14), for a spring fitted between link x and y, Kxy 
possesses four parameters and each Kxj for x≦j≦y-1 and 
Kiy for x+1≦i≦y possesses two parameters. Therefore, 
in order for the number of the design parameters 
equations to exceed that of the equations, the minimum 
number of the spring, S, can be obtained as 
4
e a
b
n S
S S ceil
-é ù
= + ê ú
ë û
  (15) 
where ceil[x] returns the minimum integer greater than 
the real number of x, Sb represents the number of basic 
springs, i.e., λ1n and λ2n, Sa is the number of available 
design parameters of basic springs, ne represents number 
of equations for gravity-balancing. 
Referring to Eq. (15), ne-Sa represent the number of 
parameters should be provided by additional springs, 
hence, ne-Sa represents the number of additional springs 
that is required for the balance of the system. Because of 
that, if a minimum number of springs is desired and 
[ne-Sa]/4 is an integer, all spring parameters of additional 
springs should be available. Note that, for each mono-
articular spring, since there are four spring parameters in 
two equations, i.e., only two spring parameters are 
available. Hence, if [ne-Sa]/4 is not an integer, one of the 
additional spring can be chosen as mono-articular spring. 
Hence, an admissible spring configuration can be 
obtained as long as the number of the spring parameters 
is equal to or greater than that of the equations in any 
subset of the stiffness block matrix, K.  
For the eight admissible orthosis as shown in Table 
3.1, two types of the open-loop kinematic chains are 
classified: single-chain type and two-branch type.  
 
Admissible spring configurations of the designs. 
Referring the single-chain type orthosis in Table 1, 
design a-1, a-3, c-1, and d-1 are the linkages of five links, 
the number of equations is twenty, ne=20, and the basic 
springs are λ15=λ25=1, therefore, Sb=2, Sa=8. Referring to 
Eq. (15), the minimum number of springs required for the 
gravity balance is five. Now, consider any subset of the 
stiffness block matrix K. The admissible spring 
configurations for the single-chain type orthosis can be 
obtained as shown as Table 1, where no mono-articular 
spring is allowed. 
Referring to the two-branch type orthosis in Table 1, 
the off-diagonal components of K and Λ shaded by 
lighter gray is due to the first chain of the orthosis, 
component matrices shaded by darker gray is due to the 
second chain, and those non-shaded component matrices 
are due to common chain of the orthosis. Take design c-2 
as an illustrative example. In order to achieve gravity 
balance of the system, since gK14 and gK15 have to be zero, 
hence λ14=1 and λ15=1 are required. However, as a spring 
fitted between link 1 and 5 and a spring between link 1 
and 4, respectively, component matrices K23, K24, K25, 
K34, and K35 become non-zero. Therefore, λ24=1 and 
λ25=1 are required, i.e., Sb=4, there are eighteen design 
equations provided by off-diagonal elements of stiffness 
block matrix, ne=18. Since basic springs are multiple-
articular springs, Sa=16. Since ne> Sa, according to Eq. 
(15), one additional spring is required. Consider the fitted 
location for the additional spring. Since there are six 
equations and eight parameters in the second chain of K, 
no additional spring is required in the second chain. 
Again, because of eight design parameters for six 
equations in first chain, no additional spring is required in 
this chain. Lastly, consider the common chain of K. 
Since at least two extra design parameters are required in 
these portion, a spring fitted either between link 1 and 2, 
link 1 and 3, or between link 2 and 3 is admissible, i.e., 
either λ12, λ13 or λ23=1 is admissible.  
Similar to design c-2, the admissible spring 
configurations of design c-3 is with λ13=λ15=λ23=λ25=1, 
i.e., Sb=4. Since the basic spring fitted between link 2 and 
3 is a mono-articular spring, there are only fourteen 
parameters for sixteen equations, i.e. Sa=14 and ne=16. 
According to Eq. (15), one additional spring is required. 
Since, for the component matrices in the second chain, 
only eight design parameters are available for ten 
equations, at least two more design parameters are 
required. Hence, the additional spring can be fitted 
between link 1 and 4, link 2 and 4, or link 4 and 5, i.e., 
λ14, λ24 or λ45=1, as shown in Table 1. Following the 
methodology for the determination of the admissible 
spring configurations, the minimum number and the 
connectivity of the springs required for the gravity 
balance of the system can be evaluated. Since the 
minimum number of the springs required for the gravity 
balance of the system is four as shown in Table 1, design 
a-2 is selected as the mechanism for the orthosis. 
V. Gravity Balance of the Orthosis and the Human 
Lower Limb 
The functional representation of the a-2 type lower 
limb orthosis with fitted springs is shown in Fig. 5, where, 
the origin O is defined on the intersection of the vertical 
line of hip joint and the level of tenth rib, while a person 
stands still [13]. In Fig. 5, the dark-heavy lines and the 
thin-gray lines represent the orthosis and human lower 
limb, respectively. According to Eq.(9), the gravitational 
potential energy gU of the orthosis and the human lower 
limb can be obtained as 
2nd IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics , ISRM2011  November 3-5                                                                 IMD-123

Fig. 7 shows the joint force and joint torque are 
substantially reduced by the orthosis, and gravitational 
potential energy of the system is fully balanced by the 
elastic potential energy provided by fitted springs in the 
orthosis. Note that, because the motion of the human 
lower limb is assumed slow and the inertia effect is 
ignored, the simulation is implemented in the pseudo-
static mode.

VII. Conclusion 
Design of a portable lower limb orthosis for persons 
with motor system impairments is presented. In this 
design, the movement of the hip joint due to the rotation 
of the pelvis and the working space of the lower limb 
during walking is considered, such that the discomfort 
induced by the motion incompatibility between the 
orthosis and the human lower limb can be alleviated. The 
orthosis is also capable of compensating the gravity 
effect of the human lower limb and the orthosis during 
the swing phase. As a result, the motor-impaired persons 
can raise their lower limb with less effort since the forces 
and torques at the hip and the knee joints can be 
substantially reduced. Based on the anthropometric data 
for the middle-size subjects, the orthosis and the human 
lower limb are modeled and simulated in ADAMS, 
where the results show the conceptual design of such a 
gravity-balancing orthosis is feasible. Design of a device 
to switch on and off the spring forces between the swing 
phase and the stance phase, and the prototyping, testing, 
and performance evaluation of the orthosis will be 
implemented in the near future.

Fig. 1  TWO-DOF, SEVEN-LINK GKC OF 5-12-1 WITH 
TWO CLUCHES 
GKC of 5-12-1 is degenerated into a one-DOF, five-link GKC 
of 2210-2a [10] as shown in Fig. 1(c). On the other hand, as 
C2 is engaged, links 4 and 5 are connected as one link of (4+5) 
and the two-DOF GKC of 5-12-1 is degenerated into a one-
DOF, six-link GKC of 6505 [10] as shown in Fig. 1(d). The 
process for the reduction of mobility and the change of 
topological structure of a GKC by connection of two links for 
the desired kinematic behavior is referred to as mobility 
degeneration of a GKC. Comparing with these two topological 
changes of 5-12-1, it can be observed that, for both 
degenerations: (1) The DOF of 5-12-1 is reduced from two to 
one; (2) Connection of links results in the topological change 
of a GKC.  
In this paper, the necessary conditions and operation rules for 
a GKC to be degenerated into a changed GKC of lower 
mobility is disclosed. It has been shown that a GKC of higher-
DOF can be associated with its degenerated GKCs of lower-
DOF as illustrated in the example of Fig. 1. Since the 
degenerated GKCs of 2210-2a and 6505 can be considered as 
members of the degenerated kinematic family of 5-12-1, a 
DOF as illustrated in the example of Fig. 1. Since the 
degenerated GKCs of 2210-2a and 6505 can be considered as 
members of the degenerated kinematic family of 5-12-1, a 
higher-DOF GKC with its degenerated lower-DOF GKC(s) 
can be associated together to form a kinematic family through 
the process of mobility degeneration. Kinematic families 
among the non-fractionated GKCs with up to three-DOF, 
eight-link are fully investigated and classified. 
2. CLASSIFICATION OF GKCS BASED ON TYPES 
OF COAXAIL LINKS FOR MOBILITY 
DEGENERATION 
2.1. Prerequisites of Mobility Degeneration of a 
GKC 
To ensure a GKC to be workable after mobility 
degeneration, the degenerated GKC has to be satisfied with 
the fundamental constitution of a GKC, where the center 
distances of meshing gears has to be constant. To make the 
center distance of geared pairs constant, Buchsbaum and 
Freudenstein [12] pointed out that the sub-graph of a GKC 
formed by deleting all geared edges from its graph forms a 
tree, i.e., the sub-graph of 5-12-1 is a tree as shown in Fig. 
1(e). However, if two non-coaxial links, say, links 3 and 7 of 
5-12-1, are connected, the sub-graph contains a circuit formed 
by links 1, 2, (3+7) and 6 and their associated thin edges as 
shown in Fig. 1(f). Since it violates the structural 
characteristics of a GKC, the non-coaxial links 3 and 7 can not 
be connected. Hence, connection of non-coaxial links is not 
admissible for mobility degeneration. On the other hand, as 
coaxial links 2 and 5 are connected as shown in Fig. 1(c), both 
thin edges of 2-3 and 2-5 are removed and the sub-graph of 
such a degenerated GKC remains a tree.  Moreover, when two 
coaxial links, say, links 4 and 5 of GKC of 5-12-1, are 
connected, since links 4 and 5 are both adjacent to link 2 with 
the same axis level of “c”, one of the axes is redundant and 
can be removed. Hence, the sub-graph of such a degenerated 
GKC remains a tree as shown in Fig. 1(g). Therefore, 
F1 : Only coaxial links can be used for mobility degeneration 
of a GKC.  
2.2. Intra-KU and Inter-KU Coaxial Links of GKCs 
Although GKCs of 2210-2a and 6505 are both obtained 
by the connection of two coaxial links of 5-12-1, the results 
are different. Based on the concept of kinematic fractionation, 
GKC of 5-12-1 can be fractionated into four kinematic units 
(KUs) [11] as shown in Fig. 1 (h), where each KU is a single-
DOF sub-GKC. Since links 2 and 5 are two coaxial links in 
KU4, connection of link 2 and link 5 causes KU4 to lose one 
DOF, resulting in all links inside KU4 to behave as a rigidly 
connected link of (2+3+5). Hence, GKC of 2210-2a can be 
also achieved by connecting links 2 and 3. For the 
degeneration, both numbers of turning pairs and geared pairs 
of a GKC are reduced and the number of turning pairs is 
reduced more than that of geared pairs by one as shown in Fig. 
1(c). Hence,

3.1. Bases of Intra-KU Degeneration 
Except for single-KU GKCs, GKC contains multiple KUs 
where each KU connects to its adjacent KU(s) by common 
links and common turning pairs, or referred to as the common 
linkage of KUs [14]. Three types of common linkages among 
KUs are identified in the GKCs with up to three-DOF and 
eight-link as 
- Two-link chain type: the common linkage that is shared 
exclusively by two KUs, e.g., the common linkage 
between KU1 and KU2 of 5-12-1in Fig. 1(h). 
- Coaxial-triangle type: the common linkages that are 
shared by three KUs and their common turning pairs form 
a triangle, e.g., the common linkages formed by KU2, 
KU3 and KU4 of 5-12-1 in Fig. 1(h). 
- Coaxial-quadrangle type: the common linkages that are 
shared by four KUs and their common turning pairs form 
a quadrangle, e.g., the common linkages formed by KU1, 
KU2, KU3 and KU4 of 3F-2-2 in Fig. 2(a). 
The two-link chain type common linkage and the coaxial-
triangle type of common linkages are identified in the  two-
DOF GKCs with up to seven-link [15], while the coaxial-
quadrangle type is identified only in three-DOF GKCs of 
eight-link. A KU-chain is referred to a chain of KUs, where 
each KU is adjacent to other KUs by two-link chain type 
common linkage only, e.g., KU1 and KU2 of 5-12-1 of Fig. 1(g) 
forms a KU-chain. While any KU in a KU-chain is 
degenerated due to intra-KU degeneration, common links 
shared by its adjacent KU(s) would be connected as one link, 
resulting in consecutive degeneration of all KUs in the KU-
chain into one link.  
R1: All links of a KU or KU-chain is degenerated into one link 
when one of the KUs is degenerated by intra-KU coaxial links. 
Moreover, if such a degenerated KU or KU-chain is 
connected to other KUs by coaxial-triangle type or coaxial-
quadrangle type common linkages, an intra-KU degenerated 
GKC can be obtained by deleting the entire degenerated KU 
or KU-chain from its graph and then connecting common links 
shared with other KUs. As a result, the common linkages of 
coaxial-triangle type become two-link type and coaxial-
quadrangle type become coaxial-triangle type. Thus, 
R2 : An intra-KU degenerated GKC can be obtained by 
deleting the entire degenerated KU or KU-chain from its 
graph and then connecting the common links shared with 
other KUs, and. consequently, the common linkages of 
coaxial-triangle and coaxial-quadrangle type within such a 
GKC are degenerated into a two-link chain and coaxial-
triangle type, respectively.  
3.2. Intra-KU Degeneration Based on Graph 
Representation 
Referring to the three-DOF, eight-link GKC of 3F-2-2 in 
Fig. 2(a), one-DOF, four-link GKC can be obtained through 
two levels of intra-KU degeneration. As shown in Fig. 2(a), 
GKC of 3F-2-2 is composed of four KUs where each KU can 
be used for intra-KU degeneration. For the first level of intra-
KU degeneration, as two coaxial links in KU1 are connected, 
according to R1, KU1 is degenerated into one link of (1+4+5). 
According to R2, KU1 is removed from the graph, the 
remaining common links of links 1and 4 are connected, and 
the common linkages of coaxial-quadrangle type become 
coaxial-triangle type. Referred to the atlas of two-DOF, six-
link GKCs [4], GKC of 4-2-1 is obtained. Similarly, while 
KU2, KU3 and KU4 are degenerated, respectively, GKCs of 4-
1-1, 4-1-1 and 4-1-2 can be obtained. Since rotation graphs of 
4-1-1 and 4-1-2 are isomorphic, the two GKCs are considered 
to have identical kinematic behavior. This indicates that 
although GKC of 3F-2-2 has four options for the intra-KU 
degenerations, only two distinct kinematic behaviors, 4-1-# 
and 4-2-#, are obtained. 
For the second level of intra-KU degeneration, 
degeneration of each KU of 4-2-1 results in a GKC of 2200-1, 
while degeneration of KU1, KU2 and KU4 of the lower 4-1-1 
in Fig. 2(a) yields GKCs of 2200-1, 2200-2a and 2200-2b, 
respectively. Note that, since 4-1-1 and 4-1-2 are isomorphic 
rotation graphs, intra-KU degeneration of 4-1-1 or 4-1-2 leads 
to the same degenerated GKCs of either 2200-1, 2200-2a or 
2200-2b. For this specific example, it is observed that: (1) All 
GKCs of isomorphic rotation graphs result in a same 
kinematic behavior(s) by intra-KU degeneration; (2) Same 
kinematic behavior of a degenerated GKC may be obtained 
from various original GKCs, e.g., GKC of 2200-1 can be 
degenerated from either 4-1-# or 4-2-# as shown in Fig. 2(a). 
3.3. Modified Rotation Graph Representation for 
Intra-KU  Degeneration 
Since isomorphic GKCs due to intra-KU degeneration 
yield the same kinematic behavior(s), axis levels of graphs are 
insignificant for the intra-KU degeneration of a GKC. Hence, 
for intra-KU degeneration, GKCs can be conveniently 
clustered by rotation graphs. However, since the traditional 
rotation graph representation [1] does not contain information 
of the common linkages of a GKC, modified rotation graphs 
are used. A modified rotation graph can be obtained by 
removing all axis labels and their associated thin edges except 
common linkages from the graph of a GKC. In modified 
rotation graph representation, a heavy edge represents a geared 
pairs and a thin edge represents a turning pairs of a common 
linkage between/among KUs. For clarity, coaxial-triangle and 
-quadrangle type common linkages are represented by a 
shaded triangle and quadrangle, respectively and a heavy edge 
and a common linkage thin edge within a same KU are 
grouped by a thin-line arc. For a KU with more than one 
heavy edge, all heavy edges in a KU are grouped by heavy-
line arcs.  
Based on representation of modified rotation graph, GKC 
of 3F-2-2 can be represented as shown in Fig. 2(b). According 
to R2, as KU1 of 3F-2-2 is degenerated, the heavy edge and 
the thin edge of common linkage of KU1 is removed and 
common links of 1 and 4 are connected, yielding a 
degenerated GKC of 4-2-1. Furthermore, if KU2 of 4-2-1 is 
degenerated, a modified rotation graph representation of 2200-
1 can be obtained as shown in Fig. 2(b).

FIG. 3  INTER-KU DEGENERATION OF THREE-DOF, EIGHT-LINK GKC OF 3F-3-3 
4.3. Modified Rotation Graph Representation for 
Inter-KU Degeneration 
For clarity, easy operation and without loss of generality, 
the inter-KU degeneration can be performed based on the 
representation of modified rotation graph. Since the locations 
of the inter-KU coaxial links are required for the inter-KU 
degeneration, labels of axis levels and dash-lines are added. 
For example, referring to the GKC of 3F-3-3 in Fig. 3(b), 
coaxial links 5-(1)-6 are with labeled “b” and connected by a 
dash-line. For the first level of inter-KU degeneration, 
according to R4, since the thin edges of common linkages of 
KU1 and KU2 are both carrier-to-gear types, as links 5 and 6 
are connected, the geared edges of KU1 and KU2 are 
connected, the thin edges of 1-2 and 1-4 are removed, and a 
new KU’1 is yielded. Again, for  the second level of inter-KU 
degeneration, as the GKC of 5-9-2 is degenerated by 1-(4)-3, 
since the common linkages of KU’1 is gear-to-gear type, the 
common linkages of 2-3, 3-4 and 2-4 are removed to form a 
new KU as shown in Fig. 3(b). Note that, since the number of 
geared edges of a GKC stays unchanged through the process 
of inter-KU degeneration, the connection of heavy edges is 
determined by the connection of x-(z)-y. Referring to the GKC 
of 5-7-1 in Fig. 3(c), while the GKC is degenerated by the 
inter-KU coaxial links 4-(3)-7 labeled with “a”, since the thin 
edges of the common linkages of KU2 and KU3 are both 
carrier-to-gear type, thin edges of 1-2 and 2-3 are removed and 
links 4 and 7 are connected. As a result, a degenerated GKC of 
6506 is obtained. Similar operation can be performed as the 
GKC of 5-7-1 is degenerated by the inter-KU  
coaxial links 6-(2)-3 labeled with “b”, the thin edges of 1-2 
and 3-2 are removed and links 3 and 6 are connected. 
However,  
since geared edge 2-7 is disconnected from other geared chain, 
a common linkage is required between links 2 and (3+6) as 
shown in Fig. 3(c). 
5. KINEMATIC FAMILIES OF GKCS WITH UP TO 
THREE-DOF AND EIGHT-LINK 
5.1. Number of Links of GKCs Due to Intra-
KU/Inter-KU Degeneration 
According to C1 and C2, the numbers of turning edges 
and geared edges of an intra- or inter-KU degenerated GKC 
are reduced differently. Hence, the reduced number of links of 
an intra- or inter-KU degenerated GKC is also different. Let N 
be the number of links of a GKC and N’intra and N’inter as the 
numbers of links of the degenerated GKC due to intra- and 
inter-KU degeneration, respectively. Denote ni as the number 
of links of KUi in a KU-chain and k as the number of KUs in a 
KU-chain. Note that if a KU-chain contains only one KU, k=1. 
Since a KU-chain contains k KUs and (k − 1) two-link chain 
type common linkages, the total number of links of a KU-

THREE-DOF, EIGHT-LINKS DUE TO INTRA-KU 
DEGENERATION 
intra- or inter-KU degeneration. For example, GKCs of 4-1-1 
and 4-2-1 as shown in Fig. 2, have distinct topological 
structures, yet both GKCs can be degenerated into GKC of 
2200-1 after one level of degeneration. Thus, GKCs of 4-1-1 
and 4-2-1 are called degenerated isomorphism. Based on Figs. 
5 and 6, degenerated isomorphism of GKCs with up to three-
DOF, eight-link can be classified into three types: 
Identical type: Identical type of degenerated isomorphism is 
defined as GKCs, for which all their degenerated GKCs are 
identical. For example, in Fig. 4(b), the two GKCs of 5-10-# 
and three GKCs of 5-14-# are all degenerated into GKCs of 
2200-2 and 3020-1 by intra-KU degeneration. Hence, GKCs 
of 5-10-# and 5-14-# are referred to as the identical type of 
degenerated isomorphism. 
- Inclusive type: Inclusive type of degenerated isomorphism 
is defined as GKCs, for which all degenerated GKCs of 
one GKC fall into a subset of the degenerated GKCs of 
another GKC. For example, in Fig. 4(a), kinematic 
behavior of the degenerated GKCs of 3F-1-# is the subset 
of the degenerated GKCs of 3F-2-#. Thus, GKCs of 3F-1-
# and 3F-2-# are referred to as the inclusive type of 
degenerated isomorphism. 
- Partial type: Partial type of degenerated isomorphism is 
defined as GKCs which have some identical degenerated 
GKCs, while some are not. For example, in Fig. 5(c), 
GKC of 5-5-1 can be degenerated into 6402 and 6501, 
while GKC of 5-6-1 can be degenerated into 6402 and 
6404. Since 6402 are the same, GKCs of 5-5-1 and 5-6-1 
are referred to the partial type of degenerated 
isomorphism. 
5.5. Mapping of GKCs of higher-DOF to GKCs of 
lower-DOF  
Based on Figs. 5 and 6, kinematic families of GKCs with 
up to three-DOF and eight-link can be related as shown in Fig. 
7, where each block denotes a set of GKCs with specified 
DOFs and number of links. In each block, the first pound sign 
of #(#) denotes the number of kinematic behaviors and the 
second pound sign inside a bracket represents the number of 
GKCs. The number # inside a small corner-block denotes the 
number of GKCs with inter-KU coaxial links. Intra- and inter-
KU mobility degeneration is represented by the directional 
arrows of heavy-line and double-thin-line, respectively. 
It is observed that all one-DOF, four- and five- link GKCs 
in the atlas can be obtained from either from two-DOF, six- or 
seven-link GKCs due to intra-KU degeneration. Also, all two-
DOF, six-link GKCs in the atlas can be obtained from three-
DOF, eight-link GKCs due to intra-KU degeneration. Hence, 
by intra-KU degeneration, GKCs of higher-DOF can be fully 
mapped into all degenerated GKCs of lower-DOF. However, 
by inter-KU degeneration, GKCs of higher-DOF can be 
mapped into only partial GKCs of lower-DOF. For example, 
the four three-DOF, eight-link GKCs can only be degenerated 
into four out of twenty-nine two-DOF, seven-link GKCs as 
indicated in the small box on the directional arrow of double-
thin-line in Fig. 6. Similarly, the twenty-nine two-DOF, seven-
link GKCs can be degenerated into fifteen out of eighty-one 
one-DOF, six-link GKCs, and the only two-DOF, six-link 
GKC can be degenerated into one out of thirteen  one-DOF, 
five-link GKCs.

講，講述其研究的發展方向，並如何使其研究與教學結合，其經驗的分享，令人
獲益良多。當天參加了所有時段的技術研討會，並參加了此次會議的大會及閉幕
式。由於由台大張所鋐教授主導的團隊積極爭取 2015年的 IFToMM大會到台北舉
辦，與主要對手德國與日本間的競爭頗為激烈。第一次投票結果台北 15票、德國
15票、日本 2票，必需進行第二輪投票。 
會議晚宴的第二輪投票仍舊是台北 16 票與德國 16 票的同票結果，最後由主
席裁定 minority win 由台北主辦 2015年 IFToMM大會。晚宴中，顏鴻森副校長並
獲選為 IFToMM 的永久榮譽會員，以表彰其卓越的學術成就。張所鋐教授並獲選
為 IFToMM執行委員會員。 
隔天舉行 IFToMM 執行委員會會議，本人與幾位教授一起參觀獲選為世界遺
產的 Guanajuato 舊城區，傍晚搭機離開墨西哥，稍後抵達美國洛杉磯，停留二天
後，搭機返回台北桃園機場。研討會全程共歷經 5天，在 6月 23日結束，超過有
數百位專家學者與會。 
二、與會之學術心得與建議 
參加本次研討會深感國外學者對於全球科技所面臨的挑戰與亟待解決的問
題，都能提出創意的思考，並獲得到企業與政府的資源挹注。因此，企業或政府應
對基礎的工程研究有更多的支援。 
IFToMM每四年一次的研討會與每年的 ASME國際研討會，並列為全球最重要
的機構學術會議，使本人對世界各國在此領域發展的深度與廣度，有更近一步的了
解，並能有機會與來自各國及國內的學者互動，並討論到專業技術、經濟發展、與
文化等議題，並有機會學習其他學者的治學風範，確實令人獲益良多。 
除研討會外，本人也觀察到墨西哥社會的貧富差距之大令人吃驚，富人居住區
可比美歐美日的高級住宅區，而窮人則居住在沒水沒電的山坡貧民窟，月入 200美
元。在墨西哥市觀光區看到一個原住民父親帶著妻子與襁褓中的嬰兒，頂著烈日彈
著吉他，期望獲得微薄的小費過活，令人難過。 
三、預期成效 
過去幾年參加 IDETC與 IFToMM等大型研討會的論文，經修改後轉投至各 SCI
期刊，均有不錯的成果。此次報告的論文，亦將在修改後投至Mechanism and Machine 
Theory期刊。

kinematic chains (GKCs) [16] that could be used as one-
DOF transmission mechanisms. Based on these seven 
GKCs and design of the clutch sequence, five three-speed 
and nineteen four-speed transmission mechanisms were 
obtained. Chatterjee and Tsai [17] further proposed the 
canonical graph representation to exclude pseudo-
isomorphic graphs [18]. Based on concept of the one-
DOF transmission mechanisms, Tsai et al. [3] proposed a 
two-DOF hybrid transmission composed of a one-DOF 
GKC and a ground link. The graph representation of the 
two-DOF hybrid transmission is shown in Fig. 1(a), 
where links are represented by vertices, gear pairs by 
heavy edged lines, revolute joints by thin edged lines. For 
clarity, gray vertex, solid vertex and double vertex 
hereafter represent for the input, output and ground link, 
respectively. With various clutch sequences, such a two-
DOF hybrid transmission can be operated in five major 
modes: power mode, engine mode, motor mode, 
regenerative braking mode and continuous variable 
transmission (CVT) mode and in thirteen sub-modes with 
desired speed ratios. For this specific hybrid transmission, 
as a band clutch is engaged, ground link and one of its 
coaxial links are connected as one link, and the two-DOF 
transmission mechanism degenerates into a one-DOF 
transmission as shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1 (c), 
respectively. As a rotating clutch is engaged, two coaxial 
links in the one-DOF GKC are connected, the entire one-
DOF, six-link GKC degenerates as one rigidly connected 
link. Consequently, the two-DOF transmission becomes a 
two-link chain type mechanism as shown in Fig. 1(d). 
Similar to Tsai’s design, most proposed two-DOF 
parallel transmission mechanisms were composed of a 
one-DOF GKC and a ground link [3-10]. Although these 
two-DOF hybrid transmissions can provide various speed 
ratios for each operation mode, their degenerated one-
DOF geared mechanisms possess GKCs of identical 
topologies similar to those shown in Figs. 1(b) and (c). 
Because of this, determination of gear ratio between each 
gearing pair is difficult and can not be obtained 
independently. 
In this paper, a systematic methodology for the 
topological synthesis of a class of two-DOF fractionated 
parallel hybrid transmission is proposed, where the two-
DOF fractionated parallel transmissions are composed of 
a one-DOF GKC and a one-DOF geared mechanism, 
rather than a ground link. For such fractionated parallel 
hybrid transmissions, one-DOF geared mechanisms with 
various topologies can be obtained and determination of 
the gear ratio for each gearing pair will be handy. 
Characteristics of two-DOF fractionated parallel hybrid 
transmissions are first investigated. Admissible one-DOF 
GKCs and one-DOF geared mechanisms with up to six 
links that can be used in the two-DOF fractionated 
parallel hybrid transmissions are obtained from the 
enumerated atlas of the existing one-DOF GKCs. 
Operating rules for the degeneration of the two-DOF 
fractionated parallel hybrid transmission are developed. 
As a consequence, topological synthesis of two-DOF 
fractionated parallel hybrid transmissions with minimum 
number of links and with required numbers of distinct 
one-DOF geared mechanisms can be accomplished.

2 An Existing Fractionated Parallel Hybrid Transm-
ission 
Referring to the functional representation of the two-
DOF fractionated parallel hybrid transmission 
mechanism [19] with clutches C1, C2 and B1 as shown 
in Fig. 2(a). In the figure, link 3 is a direct-driving link 
from the engine (input 1), link 6 is connected to electric 
motor (input 2) through rotating clutch C2, link 4 is the 
output link, and link 7 is the ground link. The graph 
representation of the transmission mechanism of Fig 2(a) 
is shown in Fig. 2(b), where links are represented by 
vertices, gear pairs by heavy edged lines, revolute joints 
by thin edged lines and labeled according to their 
corresponding locations in space.

For this specific two-DOF fractionated hybrid

    Liu et al. [23] proposed that all end vertices of a geared 
mechanism had to be assigned as ground, input or output 
link to prevent redundant links. An end vertex is defined 
as an open end vertex of a heavy edged chain and is not 
shared by other kinematic units (KUs). For example, link 
4 of Fig. 1 (a) and link 3, 6 and 7 of Fig. 2(b) are end 
vertices. Note that link 1 of Fig. 2(a) is not an end vertex, 
since it is commonly shared with the output and the 
ground component. Link 3 of Fig. 1(a) is also not an end 
vertex, because it is commonly shared by two KUs. To 
prevent redundant links, all end vertices must be assigned 
as an input, an output, a ground or a cut link. Since each 
component composes of an output (or a ground) link, an 
input link and a cut link, respectively, an admissible 
component should possess no greater than three the end 
vertices as  
           e 3£                                                            (2) 
According to Eqs. (1) and (2), eleven admissible one-
DOF GKCs with up to six links from the existing atlas of 
the one-DOF GKCs [16] are obtained and tabulated in 
Table 2, where the one-DOF GKCs with three and four 
coaxial links are shown in Table 2(a) and 2(b), 
respectively. In Table 2(a), all GKCs possess two end 
vertices, while in Table 2 (b), GKC of 6506-1 has one 
end vertex, GKC of 6206-2, 6503-7 and 6503-8 have two 
end vertices, and GKC of 3020-2a and 6401-9 have three 
end vertices. 
5. Morphed Mechanisms of Two-DOF Hybrid 
Transmission Mechanisms 
Morphed mechanisms of a two-DOF hybrid 
transmission mechanism can be obtained by the 
engagement of a band clutch or a rotation clutch as 
shown in Table 1, where input link 3 and cut link 1 are 
connected with C1 engaged, input link 3 and ground link 
7 are connected with B1 engaged, and input 2 is 
connected to link 6 with C2 engaged. It is observed that: 
(1) all links that are connected by a clutch are coaxial; (2) 
ground and input links can be connected by a clutch; (3) 
connection of an output link to other coaxial link is not 
admissible [2]. Hence, 
R1. For a two-DOF fractionated transmission 
mechanism, all coaxial links, except the output link, can 
be connected to each other by either a band clutch or a 
rotating clutch.  
    Although connection of link 1 and 3 and connection of 
link 3 and 7 as shown in Table 1 are both coaxial 
connection of links, the results are different. Connection 
of coaxial links within a same component is referred to as 
the intra-coaxial connection, while connection of coaxial 
links pertaining to different components is referred to as 
the inter-coaxial connection. The morphed mechanisms 
due to the intra- and inter-coaxial connection are referred 
to as the intra- and inter-morphed mechanisms, 
respectively. 
5.1 Intra-morphed mechanisms 
As a pair of intra-coaxial links is connected, the 
number of thin edges and is always reduced more than 
the number of heavy edges by one. As a result, the one-
DOF component, where intra-coaxial connection is 
performed, degenerates into a zero-DOF component, i.e., 
a single link, and the GKC of the other component 
remains unchanged. Hence, 
R2. The intra-morphed mechanism of a two-DOF 
fractionated parallel transmission mechanism possesses 
a GKC of the other component where the intra-coaxial 
connection is not performed. 
According to R2, two intra-morphed mechanisms can 
be obtained if the GKCs of the components are distinct, 
while only one can be obtained if both GKCs of the 
components are identical. Hence,  
R3. The number of intra-morphed mechanisms, mA, of a 
two-DOF fractionated parallel hybrid transmission 
mechanism is equal to one, i.e, mA=1, if the GKCs of the 
ground and output component are identical, and mA=2 if 
they are distinct.

5.2 Inter-morphed Mechanisms 
As the inter-coaxial connection is performed, one of 
the thin edges incident to the coaxial links becomes 
redundant and can be removed. Referring to the two-
13th World Congress in Mechanism and Machine Science, Guanajuato, México, 19-25 June, 2011               A9_458

input link and the output link and hence link 1 can not be 
selected as either a cut link or an output link. 
    All admissible GKCs with up to six links for two-DOF 
fractionated parallel hybrid transmission and their 
possible assignments of the cut link and output link are 
also tabulated in Table 2. If such a GKC is used as the 
ground or output component, its corresponding cG and cO 
are given in the same row, respectively. Hence, the 
number of morphed mechanisms due to inter-coaxial 
connection can be obtained as the product of cG and cO.  
For example, in Table 2 (a), if 2200-2a is selected as the 
ground component with  as the cut link and 2210-3c is 
selected as the output component with  as the cut link 
and  as the output link, cG equals to two, cO equals to 
one, and mE equals to two. Consider the two-DOF 
fractionated transmission as shown in Fig. 3 (a). Since 
both components of the fractionated transmission are 
constituted by the identical GKC of 6401-9 as shown in 
Table 2 (b) and are jointed by the same cut link, such a 
fractionated transmission mechanism is referred to as the 
symmetric transmission mechanism. For the transmission 
mechanism, since cG and cO are both equal to two and 
link 5 is the output link, four inter-morphed mechanisms 
can be obtained due to inter-coaxial connection of link 1 
and 11, link 1 and 7 (or 8), link 4 and 11, and link 4 and 7 
(or 8). However, the two morphed mechanisms due to the 
inter-coaxial connection of link 4 and 11 and that of link 
1 and 7 (or 8) as shown in Fig. 3 (b) and 3 (c), 
respectively, are isomorphic, one of the inter-morphed 
mechanisms has to be excluded. Hence, 
R5. For a two-DOF fractionated parallel hybrid 
transmission, if the transmission mechanism is non-
symmetric, the number of the inter-morphed mechanisms 
can be obtained by 
           E G Om c c= ´                    (3a) 
, if the transmission mechanism is symmetric, the number 
of the inter-morphed mechanisms can be obtained by 
          E G O Em c c m¢= ´ -                                            (3b) 
where m’E is the number of isomorphic mechanism due to 
inter-coaxial connection. 
    Note that, for the two-DOF symmetric fractionated 
parallel hybrid transmission constituted by any GKC in 
Table 2 (a), m’E is equal to zero, while by any GKC in 
Table 2 (b), m’E is equal to one.

6 Synthesis of Fractionated Hybrid Transmission with 
m-Morphed Mechanisms 
A two-DOF fractionated parallel hybrid transmission 
can be degenerated into m one-DOF morphed 
mechanisms due to either intra- or inter-coaxial 
connection of coaxial links. Hence, 
       A Em m m= +                                                         (4) 
where mA and mE are the numbers of morphed 
mechanisms due to intra- and inter-coaxial connection of 
links, respectively. Moreover, since the ground 
component and the output component commonly share 
the cut link, the number of links of a two-DOF 
fractionated transmission mechanism is the number of 
links of a two-DOF fractionated transmission mechanism 
is 
      G On n n= +                                                            (5) 
where nG and nO are the numbers of links possessed by 
the ground component and the output component, 
respectively. Synthesis of a two-DOF fractionated hybrid 
transmission with three and four morphed mechanisms 
with minimum number of links is illustrated as follows. 
6.1 Fractionated hybrid transmissions with three 
morphed mechanisms 
For fractionated hybrid transmissions with three 
one-DOF morphed mechanisms, mA and mE can be either 
one and two or two and one, respectively, according to 
Eq. (4). 
(i)              Synthesis with mA=1 and mE=2  
For mA=1 and mE=2, the ground and the output 
component are of the same GKCs and (cG, cO) can be (2, 
1) or (1, 2), according to R5. For the case of (cG, cO)=(2, 
1), any GKC as shown in Table 2(a) satisfy the condition. 
Among them, the four-link GKC of 2200-2a possesses a 
minimum number of links and, according to Eq. (5), the 
synthesized transmission has seven links. Hence, as 
shown in Table 3, GKC of 2200-2a with its symmetric 
end vertex  as the cut link can be selected as the ground 
component, and GKC of 2200-2a with any coaxial link as 
the cut link and the output link can be selected as the 
output component as shown in the top figure of Table 3. 
Note that, no GKC in Table 2 (b) satisfy the condition of 
(cG, cO)=(1, 2). 
(ii)             Synthesis with mA =2 and mE =1 
  For mA =2 and mE =1, the ground and the output 
components are constituted of distinct GKCs and (cG, 
cO)=(1, 1), according to R5. With the consideration of 
minimum number of links, the four-link GKC of 2200-2a 
with cG=1 and the five-link GKC of 2210-3c with cO=1 
can be selected as the ground and the output component, 
respectively. GKC of 2210-3c with cG=1 as the ground 
component and GKC of 2200-2a with cO=1 as the output 
component are also admissible. Since these two resultant 
two-DOF transmission mechanisms have eight links, they 
are not shown in Table 3.
