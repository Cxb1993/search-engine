further annealing (450oC) to remove the C16EO8 and the total procedure takes more 
than 2h. Song et al. [4] further modified the pulse deposition process by using PVP as 
additive. Nevertheless, the cell efficiency of the DSSC was just 4.28%. The major 
reason might be due to the shielding effect of the long-chain PVP molecules. 
In this article, we proposed a simple, fast (within 30s) and room-temperature process 
by means of direct-current deposition in the presence of an additive, Me-EDA-Si 
generally used as a self-assembly monolayer (SAM) to modify the surface, which has 
found wide applications, especially on the electronics industry [5,6]. The morphology 
and deposition rate of the Pt counter electrodes were examined by a field-emission 
scanning electronic microscopy (FESEM). The other characterizations for serving as 
counter electrode, such as Pt loading, Rct and the cell efficiency were also carried out.

2.2 Preparation of Pt counter electrodes 
    First, the fluorine-doped tin oxide transparent glasses (FTO 13Ω/□, NSG) were 
ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone and distilled water (DI water) 
for 10 min, and then stored in isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The electrodeposition was 
carried out with an electrochemical analyzer system, CHI 627C (CH Instruments, 
USA). All experiments were done in a three-electrode cell, including a Pt plate as 
counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode (Bioanalytic 
System, 3M KCl) and FTO glasses with an exposed area of 0.64 cm2 as the working 
electrode. The base solution consisted of 10mM of PtCl4 and 0.05M of HCl. 
3-(2-Aminoethylamino) propyl -methyldimethoxysilane (Me-EDA-Si) was served as 
additive and added to the base solution in concentrations ranging from 0% to 0.5%. A 
constant current density of 10mA cm-2 was employed for electrodeposition. 
 
2.3 Characterization of electrodeposited-Pt counter electrodes 
    High-resolution filed emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi 
S4700I) was used to study the morphology of the various Pt electrodes. The Pt 
loading of the as-prepared electrode was examined by an inductively couple 
plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerKin Elmer Optima-2000DV). 
Prior to the ICP measurement, the Pt electrodes were placed in aqua regia with 
agitation for 24h to dissolve the Pt. The Chronopotentiometric study was used to 
study the overpotential during electrodeposition. The contact angle tests were 
conducted using a digital microscope (AM211, Dinolite Pro.) to investigate FTO 
surface modification.  
 
2.4 Measurement of electrochemical properties – Electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetric test 
To further investigate the catalytic activity of the Pt electrodes for tri-iodine 
reaction, its charge-transfer resistance (Rct) was measured by means of an 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a symmetric test cell with two 
identical electrodes. These two electrodes were wrapped with thermoplastic hot-melt 
Surlyn (30μm) leaving an exposed area of 0.64 cm2. The electrolyte for EIS tests 
contained 0.5M 4-tertpbutylpyridine, 1M 1, 3-dimethylimidazoliumiodine, 0.15M 
iodine, and 0.1M guanidine thiocyanate in 3-methoxypropionitrile solution. The EIS 
tests were carried out using a computer- controlled electrochemical interface system 
(Solartron Analytical, SI 1286) and HF frequency response analyzer (Solartron 
Analytical, SI 1255), and the impedance data covered frequency range from 0.1Hz to 
100kHz. In addition, cyclic voltammetric (CV) tests were employed both in 
iodine-based electrolyte and 0.5M H2SO4 solution to compare the catalytic activity 
7 
 
morphology while DC deposition was employed. For the base solution containing 
0.001 vol% Me-EDA-Si (Fig. 1(d)), the film was similar to that deposited in the 
absence of Me-EDA-Si, but rough surface with non-uniform dispersion could be 
observed. With 0.01 vol% and 0.05 vol% Me-EDA-Si added, the films became much 
rougher, and nodular structure with elongated, rod-like grains was observed. The grain 
size was about 100nm in length and 30nm in width. Although these two images 
seemed similar, there was still some difference between them. Partial aggregation of 
the nodular structures leads to clustering in the case of 0.05 vol% Me-EDA-Si. With 
0.01 vol% Me-EDA-Si in the base solution, the nodular structure was well dispersed 
and less aggregation was observed on the FTO surface, thus resulting in much more 
active surface area. When 0.5 vol% Me-EDA-Si was added in the base solution (Fig. 
1 (g)), the deposit was charcoal gray with both plate-like grains and clusters. The 
above observation indicates that the electrodeposited-Pt film obtained from the base 
solution containing 0.01 vol% Me-EDA-Si in 30s direct-current deposition seems 
more attractive than others because it shows the highest surface area. Moreover, the 
presence of Me-EDA-Si seems to inhibit the semicircle growth of Pt particles. 
 
The Pt loading was analyzed by an ICP-OES. Apparently, the loading of Pt 
increased with the increase in the concentration of Me-EDA-Si, as shown in Table. 4. 
The Pt loading in the absence of Me-EDA-Si was only about 1.06μg cm-2. 
Nevertheless, the deposition was found to speed up while adding Me-EDA-Si into the 
deposition bath. The more Me-EDA-Si was added, the higher current efficiency was 
obtained.

3.2 Chronopotentiometric studies 
Fig. 3 shows the Chronopotentiometric studies to investigate the function of 
Me-EDA-Si during Pt deposition. It can be observed that the depolarization effect can 
be observed within the first 5s of electrodeposition while the deposition bath was in 
the presence of Me-EDA-Si. The overpotential in the presence of 0.01 vol% 
Me-EDA-Si was less than that obtained in the base solution with the first 5s of 
deposition. With further increasing Me-EDA-Si concentration to 0.5 vol%, a very 
rapid drop in overpotential was found at the interval. Generally, the decrease in the 
overpotential could facilitate electrodeposition, thus resulting in an enhanced 
deposition rate [12]. This also indicates that an enhanced deposition rate can be 
obtained in the presence of ME-EDA-Si, which is in accordance with the finding from 
ICP-OES results. Therefore, Me-EDA-Si is likely to act as an accelerator during the 
Pt electrodeposition. To further realize in more detail regarding the function of 
Me-EDA-Si during electrodeposition, a FTO surface was modified with Me-EDA-Si 
prior to electrodeposition by dipping it into the solution containing 1 vol% 
Me-EDA-Si for 10 min and then the electrodeposition in the base solution was carried 
out. The change in overpotential of the pre-modified FTO substrate similar to that 
obtained in the base solution containing 0.5 vol% Me-EDA-Si can be observed, as 
shown in Fig. 3. Based on this result, we proposed that Me-EDA-Si was firstly 
anchored with the OH- functional group on the FTO surface at the start of the 
electrodeposition. Moreover, we found that Me-EDA-Si can anchor with the FTO 
surface in a very short time by means of the contact angle measurement, as shown in 
Fig. 4. An obvious increase in the contact angle on the FTO surface was observed no 
more than 2s due to the attached Me-EDA-Si, indicating that the interaction between 
FTO and Me-EDA-Si was very rapid. Consequently, a mechanism of Me-EDA-Si on 
Pt electrodeposition can be proposed, as schematically shown in Fig. 5. Firstly, 
Me-EDA-Si compounds diffuse faster than [PtCl6]2- ions from bulk solution into the 
diffusion layer in the base solution containing Me-EDA-Si due to the attraction of 
OH- functional group on the FTO surface. Then Me-EDA-Si compounds can anchor 
with OH- functional group on the FTO surface [6,10,13] and their amino group can 
provide the binding sites for the [PtCl6]2- ions, resulting in attracting more [PtCl6]2- 
ions. Thus the deposition rate can be enhanced.

本人此次以電化學研究者而會去參加在芝加哥召開之機械材料
年會，主要原因在近年來研究染料敏化太陽能電池之過程中，許多裝
配問題包括電解液外漏之技術瓶頸都是來自於電池組在陽光曝曬
下，冷縮熱漲，導致不同材質間之應力不均。所以電池技術要能產業
化，必須對材料之機械應力有所了解，也希望探討外國在此方面之研
究狀況。 
在會上，發現大多數的研究仍然是相當偏理論，能夠像我們實驗
室，就實際電能元件作材料熱應力量測的並不多，也許這方面的資訊
皆存在於美國業界，他們並不積極到公開場合發表。
