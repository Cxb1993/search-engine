圖 1 為本計畫擬製作之三軸微動平台架構圖，圖 2 則為完成的鋼製三軸微動平台。平
台機構中內含三組割痕式撓性結構，並以撓性結構來產生平台在各方向所需的位移。在本
計畫中，當一直流電場所施加於壓電致動器時，壓電致動器將會產生一股外應力施加於撓

透過三支壓電致動器(如圖 2 中三支銀色棒子)彼此的配合，而使結構中央的三角形平台，做
XYθ方向的移動。因本實驗的移動量很小，因此結合 LabVIEW 程式與 PSD 感測器量來測

no (for the ordinary ray). Many optical elements are deliberately fabricated from birefringent 
materials in order to exploit this effect, e.g. polarizers and phase retardation plates, etc. When a 
light ray passes through a phase retardation plate, a phase difference of δ  is induced. 
In a measurement system, the phase difference can be established using the heterodyne technique 
with a modulation system and a lock-in amplifier. The value of (no- ne), which is used to quantify 
the birefringence, can then be obtained. Although the refractive indices, no and ne, can also be 
determined using alternative methods, these methods generally involve complicated structures and 
procedures and are liable to errors induced by environmental and procedural noise or by an 
inadequate resolution of the experimental apparatus.  
  
Various researchers have employed linear polarized light to measure the characteristics of 
birefringent retardation waveplates. In 1997, Huang et al. [3] proposed a method for the 
simultaneous measurement of the no and ne refractive indices of quartz waveplates. The 
measurement system was based on the heterodyne type interference structure, in which the P wave 
and the S wave of the common path interference circuit were arranged such that the phase 
retardation of the quartz waveplate was measured relative to the azimuth of its main axes. 
Benkelfat et al. [4] used the Electro-Optical (E-O) modulation technique to measure the 
birefringence characteristics of optical components. In their approach, the linear polarized light 
from a He-Ne laser was passed through a linear polarized plate, where it was transformed to elliptic 
polarized light, and was then incident on a 1/4λ waveplate. The polarized state of the light, i.e. the 
phase difference between the ordinary light (i.e. the O-light) and the extraordinary light (i.e. the 
E-light) was modified by applying a voltage to the waveplate. By integrating the interferometer 
structure with suitable photoelectric circuitry, the corresponding change in the intensity of the light 
passing through the waveplate was detected and transformed into a electrical signal, which was then 
processed to obtain highly accurate measurements of the crystal’s birefringent characteristics. 
Building on the studies presented above, the present study proposes an effective, simple, and 
highly accurate optical refractive index measurement system, which is capable of quickly and 
simply measuring the refractive index of optical elements without using the complicated traditional 
heterodyne lock-in technique. 
Design and Analysis of Refractive Characteristics Measurement System  
The proposed measurement system is based on the classic Michelson interferometer structure. 
A single axis electric rotatory motor is used to rotate the tested waveplate and a PC is employed to 
process the interference signals to establish the birefringent characteristics of the tested component. 
The Michelson interferometer structure comprises a single bandwidth He-Ne laser, a beam splitter, 
two reflecting mirrors (one fixed and one movable), and a light detection circuit. In the current 
experiments, the test plate is clamped to a platform on the rotatory mirror and positioned between 
the beam splitter and the fixed reflecting mirror, as shown in Fig. 1(a). When the test plate is rotated, 
the light path through the test plate varies as a function of the angle of rotation and the refractive 
index of the waveplate. Since the light path is changed, the intensity of the detected interference

The interferometer will actually sense the light path difference, D, i.e. the path difference

where n is the refractive index of the path followed by the light and l is the path length 
difference of the path followed by the light. Multiplying Eq. 2 with the refractive indices of the 
respective paths, it can be shown that the light path difference, SD, sensed by the laser 
interferometer is given by:

In the equation above, θ, d, and , are all known. Therefore, only the function describing the 
variation of the light path difference, SD, with the refractive index, n
0n
1, of the waveplate is unknown.  
Experimental Results and Discussion 
To reduce the influence of environmental effects on the reliability of the experimental 
measurements, the experiments applied the optical experiment platform to decrease the influence of 
shake and consider the situation of the lowest temperature difference. To ensure the accuracy of the 
experimental measurements, it is necessary that: (1) the distributed light intensity of the linear 
polarized light of the laser is 50%, (2) the polarized light is vertical after passing through the beam 
splitter, (3) the surfaces of the two reflecting mirrors are vertical, and (4) the deviation angle of the 
incident light is minimized.  
The present experiments were performed using a 1/2λwaveplate fabricated of birefringent 
quartz material and a He-Ne laser with a central wavelength of 632.8 nm. Note that the choice of a 
He-Ne laser circumvented the color splitting problem. The chosen waveplate was a multi-order 
waveplate.  
Before the experiments, a vernier with an accuracy of 10 mμ was used to measure the total 
thickness, , of the waveplate. A value of 452.0totald mμ was obtained. It can be shown that:

measurement of the optical refractive indices and the thickness. The proposed design does not 
employ the traditional complex heterodyne lock-in technique. For the birefringence material, the 
optical path design of this study can measure the dual refractive indices at the same time. The 
results indicate that the thickness and refractive indices of optical elements can be measured rapidly 
and simply using the developed design. 
  
Measurement System 
Structural Design and Experimental Processes 
Fig. 1 shows the measurement system of the designing optical path. This system include the 
laser apparatus Measuring length host, a beam splitter, a motor, two quarter-wave plates and two 
plan reflectors. From the Fig.1, this can be found that the light beam pass through the sample wave 
plate at the same position. This can reduce the error of the experimental operation. 
 
Fig. 1 the high accurate measurement system. 
 
For illustration purposes, the proposed system is applied to measure the thickness and birefringence 
refractive index of a half wave plate. The measurement steps are as follows: 
(1) Adjust the beam splitter direction such that the incident light polarized in the vertical direction 
is transmitted towards the optical wave plate, while the reflex light polarized in horizontal 
direction is reference light.  
(2) Adjust the two quarter wave plates whose fast axis makes an angle  with the horizontal 
axis. Applying the reference and measured optical path. 
45o
(3) Adjust the wave plate such that the light beam enter the optical sample plate vertically and the 
go back to enter the sample plate horizontally as well as reflect from beam splitter. 
(4) Rotate the sample wave plate trough an angle θ  by using the stepping motor and record the 
corresponding interferometer experimental result. 
 
Mathematical Analysis 
Rotating the sample wave plate changes the optical path. In the present interferometer, the 
optical path difference, which is a function of the refractive index n and thickness of the crystal 
wave plate, is calculated. If the sample wave plate is birefringence, the optical path difference is a 
function of the refractive indices (  and ) and the thickness of the wave plate. The relationship 
between the optical path difference through the crystal and the rotational angle is illustrated in Fig. 
2.  The optical path difference

(HP5929A,the resolution is 100nm as the environment perturbation exits.) In this experiment, a 
birefringence waveplate is used as the test sample. the standard data [ 4 ] of the birefringence 
waveplate provided by the manufacturer (CASIX) are 1.5518en = 、  and

and refractive index of the birefringence material. From the above analyzing result, the advantages 
of the system have the following as

reflector then pass through the sample wave plate at the same position. This can reduce the error 
of the experimental operation.

Result and discussion 
The adhesive mass positions the cantilever beam tip. This paper is concerned with the variable 
volume and the material density of the adhesive mass. The radius of the spherical adhesive mass is 
shown in Table 1. The density of the variable material is shown in Table 2. In order to understand 
the relation between real mass and the equivalent mass of the adhesive mass, this paper considers 
the variable frequency of the cantilever beam with the variable volume and density of the adhesive 
mass. This result is shown in Fig.3. Fig.3 shows that the relation ship between the real mass and the 
equivalent mass of the adhesive mass is linear. The ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass 
for the Cu material is about 0.681. In order to understand the effect of the adhesive material on the 
natural frequency of the cantilever beam, this paper has taken into consideration the five materials 
of the adhesive mass. The ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass of the variable adhesive 
material is shown in Table 5. From Table 5, it can be seen that the real mass is greater than the 
equivalent mass and the ratio is from 0.6434 to 0.823. The ratio is determined by using the 
differential volume. In order to understand the effect of the density on the ratio, the density of the 
adhesive mass and the uniform volume (the radius of the spherical adhesive mass is 0.8 mμ ) change 
of the 1000 kg/m3 to 9000 kg/m3 (interval of the 1000 kg/m3) must be considered. This result is 
shown in Fig.4. From Fig.4, it can be seen that the ratio between real mass and the equivalent mass 
is more as the density of the adhesive material becomes greater. When the density of the adhesive 
mass is at 9000 kg/m3, the pC m m=  is 0.6361. As the density of the adhesive mass increases, the 
ratio converges to a special value. This means that the ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass 
of the adhesive mass is constant with the same material and position. From the comparison between 
the Table5 and Fig.4, it can be seen that the effect of the volume size of the adhesive material in the 
analytic result is clear.

Conclusion 
This paper investigates the ratio pm m  of the real mass and equivalent mass obtained by using 
the natural frequency method in consideration of the variable positions and the material density of 
the adhesive mass. From the above analytic result, this can be obtained by the following: 
1. The equivalent mass of the cantilever beam can be obtained by using the CAE method. The 
equivalent mass is . * 0.24 bm m=
2. The relation ship between real mass and equivalent mass of the adhesive mass is linear. The 
ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass is constant in the same adhesive position. 
3. The real mass is great than the equivalent mass. 
4. As the density of the adhesive mass increase, the ratio converges to a special value. 
5. As the small offset position of the adhesive exists, the variation of the ratio C is small. 
As the small adhesive mass is considered, the ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass is 
important. This can reduce the experimental error.

no (for the ordinary ray). Many optical elements are deliberately fabricated from birefringent 
materials in order to exploit this effect, e.g. polarizers and phase retardation plates, etc. When a 
light ray passes through a phase retardation plate, a phase difference of δ  is induced. 
In a measurement system, the phase difference can be established using the heterodyne technique 
with a modulation system and a lock-in amplifier. The value of (no- ne), which is used to quantify 
the birefringence, can then be obtained. Although the refractive indices, no and ne, can also be 
determined using alternative methods, these methods generally involve complicated structures and 
procedures and are liable to errors induced by environmental and procedural noise or by an 
inadequate resolution of the experimental apparatus.  
  
Various researchers have employed linear polarized light to measure the characteristics of 
birefringent retardation waveplates. In 1997, Huang et al. [3] proposed a method for the 
simultaneous measurement of the no and ne refractive indices of quartz waveplates. The 
measurement system was based on the heterodyne type interference structure, in which the P wave 
and the S wave of the common path interference circuit were arranged such that the phase 
retardation of the quartz waveplate was measured relative to the azimuth of its main axes. 
Benkelfat et al. [4] used the Electro-Optical (E-O) modulation technique to measure the 
birefringence characteristics of optical components. In their approach, the linear polarized light 
from a He-Ne laser was passed through a linear polarized plate, where it was transformed to elliptic 
polarized light, and was then incident on a 1/4λ waveplate. The polarized state of the light, i.e. the 
phase difference between the ordinary light (i.e. the O-light) and the extraordinary light (i.e. the 
E-light) was modified by applying a voltage to the waveplate. By integrating the interferometer 
structure with suitable photoelectric circuitry, the corresponding change in the intensity of the light 
passing through the waveplate was detected and transformed into a electrical signal, which was then 
processed to obtain highly accurate measurements of the crystal’s birefringent characteristics. 
Building on the studies presented above, the present study proposes an effective, simple, and 
highly accurate optical refractive index measurement system, which is capable of quickly and 
simply measuring the refractive index of optical elements without using the complicated traditional 
heterodyne lock-in technique. 
Design and Analysis of Refractive Characteristics Measurement System  
The proposed measurement system is based on the classic Michelson interferometer structure. 
A single axis electric rotatory motor is used to rotate the tested waveplate and a PC is employed to 
process the interference signals to establish the birefringent characteristics of the tested component. 
The Michelson interferometer structure comprises a single bandwidth He-Ne laser, a beam splitter, 
two reflecting mirrors (one fixed and one movable), and a light detection circuit. In the current 
experiments, the test plate is clamped to a platform on the rotatory mirror and positioned between 
the beam splitter and the fixed reflecting mirror, as shown in Fig. 1(a). When the test plate is rotated, 
the light path through the test plate varies as a function of the angle of rotation and the refractive 
index of the waveplate. Since the light path is changed, the intensity of the detected interference

where n is the refractive index of the path followed by the light and l is the path length 
difference of the path followed by the light. Multiplying Eq. 2 with the refractive indices of the

Experimental Results and Discussion

measurements, the experiments applied the optical experiment platform to decrease the influence of 
shake and consider the situation of the lowest temperature difference. To ensure the accuracy of the 
experimental measurements, it is necessary that: (1) the distributed light intensity of the linear 
polarized light of the laser is 50%, (2) the polarized light is vertical after passing through the beam 
splitter, (3) the surfaces of the two reflecting mirrors are vertical, and (4) the deviation angle of the 
incident light is minimized.  
The present experiments were performed using a 1/2λwaveplate fabricated of birefringent 
quartz material and a He-Ne laser with a central wavelength of 632.8 nm. Note that the choice of a 
He-Ne laser circumvented the color splitting problem. The chosen waveplate was a multi-order 
waveplate.  
Before the experiments, a vernier with an accuracy of 10 mμ was used to measure the total 
thickness, , of the waveplate. A value of 452.0totald mμ was obtained. It can be shown that:

measurement of the optical refractive indices and the thickness. The proposed design does not 
employ the traditional complex heterodyne lock-in technique. For the birefringence material, the 
optical path design of this study can measure the dual refractive indices at the same time. The 
results indicate that the thickness and refractive indices of optical elements can be measured rapidly 
and simply using the developed design. 
  
Measurement System 
Structural Design and Experimental Processes 
Fig. 1 shows the measurement system of the designing optical path. This system include the 
laser apparatus Measuring length host, a beam splitter, a motor, two quarter-wave plates and two 
plan reflectors. From the Fig.1, this can be found that the light beam pass through the sample wave 
plate at the same position. This can reduce the error of the experimental operation. 
 
Fig. 1 the high accurate measurement system. 
 
For illustration purposes, the proposed system is applied to measure the thickness and birefringence 
refractive index of a half wave plate. The measurement steps are as follows: 
(1) Adjust the beam splitter direction such that the incident light polarized in the vertical direction 
is transmitted towards the optical wave plate, while the reflex light polarized in horizontal 
direction is reference light.  
(2) Adjust the two quarter wave plates whose fast axis makes an angle  with the horizontal 
axis. Applying the reference and measured optical path. 
45o
(3) Adjust the wave plate such that the light beam enter the optical sample plate vertically and the 
go back to enter the sample plate horizontally as well as reflect from beam splitter. 
(4) Rotate the sample wave plate trough an angle θ  by using the stepping motor and record the 
corresponding interferometer experimental result. 
 
Mathematical Analysis 
Rotating the sample wave plate changes the optical path. In the present interferometer, the 
optical path difference, which is a function of the refractive index n and thickness of the crystal 
wave plate, is calculated. If the sample wave plate is birefringence, the optical path difference is a 
function of the refractive indices (  and ) and the thickness of the wave plate. The relationship 
between the optical path difference through the crystal and the rotational angle is illustrated in Fig.

and refractive index of the birefringence material. From the above analyzing result, the advantages 
of the system have the following as 
1. The manipulation of this study system is simple and easy. 
2. The measured method is a non-destructive measured method. 
3. The measured light beam pass through the sample wave plate and reflect from the plane 
reflector then pass through the sample wave plate at the same position. This can reduce the error 
of the experimental operation. 
4. In the optical refractive index measurement, the duel refractive indices of the birefringence 
materials can be determined by this study measurement method at the same time.

Result and discussion 
The adhesive mass positions the cantilever beam tip. This paper is concerned with the variable 
volume and the material density of the adhesive mass. The radius of the spherical adhesive mass is 
shown in Table 1. The density of the variable material is shown in Table 2. In order to understand 
the relation between real mass and the equivalent mass of the adhesive mass, this paper considers 
the variable frequency of the cantilever beam with the variable volume and density of the adhesive 
mass. This result is shown in Fig.3. Fig.3 shows that the relation ship between the real mass and the 
equivalent mass of the adhesive mass is linear. The ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass 
for the Cu material is about 0.681. In order to understand the effect of the adhesive material on the 
natural frequency of the cantilever beam, this paper has taken into consideration the five materials 
of the adhesive mass. The ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass of the variable adhesive 
material is shown in Table 5. From Table 5, it can be seen that the real mass is greater than the 
equivalent mass and the ratio is from 0.6434 to 0.823. The ratio is determined by using the 
differential volume. In order to understand the effect of the density on the ratio, the density of the 
adhesive mass and the uniform volume (the radius of the spherical adhesive mass is 0.8 mμ ) change 
of the 1000 kg/m3 to 9000 kg/m3 (interval of the 1000 kg/m3) must be considered. This result is 
shown in Fig.4. From Fig.4, it can be seen that the ratio between real mass and the equivalent mass 
is more as the density of the adhesive material becomes greater. When the density of the adhesive 
mass is at 9000 kg/m3, the pC m m=  is 0.6361. As the density of the adhesive mass increases, the 
ratio converges to a special value. This means that the ratio of the real mass and the equivalent mass 
of the adhesive mass is constant with the same material and position. From the comparison between 
the Table5 and Fig.4, it can be seen that the effect of the volume size of the adhesive material in the 
analytic result is clear.
