ABSTRACT 
 
Immune system is regarded a remarkable mechanism 
capable of self-organizing to best strengthen its function 
for defending outside attacks. As such, the Artificial 
Immune System (AIS) theory is gradually adopted in 
designing optimal computation systems. Despite that 
Artificial Immune Systems have recently attracted 
significant researches and demonstrated a high potential 
in various areas, its application to medical image 
analysis is relatively unexplored. To remedy this deficit, 
this paper presents the exploration of applying Clonal 
Selection Algorithm (CSA) of Artificial Immune 
Systems for the classification of the brain MR images. In 
order to verify the feasibility and efficiency of this 
method, evaluations using classification rate and 
likelihood ratios are adopted based on manifold 
assessment. Results are also compared with Perceptron 
neural networks and Fuzzy C-Means, and show its 
promising potential in medical image analysis.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Borrowing biological features to the design of advanced 
computational systems has been one of the pursuits to 
researchers in improving computation capabilities. Some 
of the examples are the development of neural networks  
and genetic algorithms. Recently the human immune 
system theory, due to its superior capability of producing 
antibody through mutation and clone selection for 
defending invaders, is regarded one of the most 
promising biological approaches which could lead to 
another break through in computation.  
Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) have been 
developed as one new computational intelligent 
approach and successfully applied in different fields, 
such as data analysis , TSP problems, etc. Because AIS 
has these characteristics: uniqueness, self/non-self 
discrimination, learning, and memory, it is very 
appropriate for pattern recognition. However despite of 
its extensive applications in various areas, using AIS in 
medical image analysis is relatively unexplored. Based 
on this consideration, this paper presents a study of 
using AIS in MR image analysis.  
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is considered 
one of the most commonly adopted image modalities in 
the diagnosis of complicated disease situations because 
of its high resolution, non-invasive nature, and 
superiority of presenting soft tissues. It has been applied 
to the diagnosis of various organs including the brain, 
the abdominal and the cardiovascular diseases. MRI is 
becoming the new favorite image modality and has the 
potential to gradually replace the present invasive 
examination methods.  
MRI usually contains a great amount of image 
information while also has high sensitivity to noise and 
artifacts. Therefore, traditionally in clinic the most 
common way of diagnosis is relying on professional 
medical personnel. Recently several algorithms have 
been developed, such as artificial neural networks, 
Fuzzy C-Means, K-Means etc., for MRI tissue 
classification. In this paper, the exploration of using AIS 
for MRI tissue classification is conducted. The results 
will also be compared with traditional algorithms for 
evaluation. 
The remaining parts of this paper are organized as 
follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of the natural 
immune system and related terminologies. The Artificial 
Immune Systems and the Clonal Selection Algorithm 
(CSA) are described in Section 3. Section 4 presents the 
algorithm using CSA for the classification of the MRI 
brain tissues. Section 5 presents the experimental results. 
Finally the conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 
 
 2.1.6. T Cells 
The T cell plays an important role in the immune 
response. It is differentiated in the thymus. The major 
function is ensuring that other cells operate normally 
and attack the pathogen directly. After a T cell is ripe, it 
will move to the lymphoid tissue. As regards to the 
regulating function, T cells can be divided into a Helper 
T cells and suppressor T cells. The function of the 
former is to excite B cells, achieving the purpose of a 
warning transmission. The latter is used to suppress B 
cells from proliferating because an overabundance of B 
cell duplication may cause over-immunity. Figure 2 
illustrates the relationships between the cells and the 
behavior of how they help and suppress the activation of 
B cells.

3. ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM 
 
Originally, the Immune network theory was developed 
by Jerne in 1973. In 1986, Farmer brought up the 
artificial immune system model [10] that sparked a lot of 
theoretical research about the artificial immune network 
system and its relevant applications. Some of the 
researches focus on the theoretical studies, such as the 
immunity algorithms, network models, etc. Some focus 
on its applications such as data mining, trouble 
diagnostics, network security, pattern recognition, 
adaptive control, etc. In this paper, we will focus on the 
use of the CSA of the immune system for MRI 
Classification. The algorithm of CSA is described in the 
following. 
 
Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) 
 
L. N. De Castro and F. J. Von zuben developed the 
Clonal Selection Algorithm [11] on the basis of the 
clonal selection theory. The basic concept follows 
biological evolution theory, with “survival of the fittest” 
as its foundation. The immune system has the 
phenomenon of evolution. Burnet proposed the Clonal 
Selection theory in 1959: As the system is excited by an 
antigen, it will cause antibodies to increase to certain 
levels and combine with the antigen. Briefly, after the 
pathogen has invaded the body, it will start to proliferate, 
and destroy the internal cells. In order to maintain the 
balance of physiological function, one of the ways the 
immune system fights against the pathogen is to 
proliferate the immune cells, then recognize and 
eliminate the pathogen.  
The diversity of Clonal Selection Algorithm is one 
topics often discussed by researchers. George and Gray, 
etc. presented a clear answer in a discussion in 1999, 
and proposed that CSA has the ability to prevent the 
Local convergent. Figure 3 illustrates this idea by 
considering all possible antigen-binding sites depicted in 
the x-axis, with the most similar ones adjacent to each 
other. The Ag-Ab affinity is shown on the y-axis. In 
CSA mathematical calculation processes, the antibody 
(A) is selected during a primary response; the mutations 
allow the immune system to explore the antibodies with 
higher affinity in the local areas around the antigen and 
keep the antibody with higher affinity. This phenomenon 
may cause local convergence (A'). However the 
explored antibody was calculated by its affinity and 
sifted again and again – this will stop it from changing 
to lower affinity. The result of sifting will only be better 
and better, and the global optimum solution will finally 
be found. This famous characteristic is named Receptor 
editing.

The CSA can be described as follows: 
 
(i) Available P repertoire that can be decomposed into 
several different subsets. Let M represent the set 
of memory cells. Pr represent the set of remaining, 
P = Pr + M. 
 
(ii) According to the affinity, select n of the highest 
affinity elements Pn. 
 
(iii) Clone the n selected elements, generating new 
clone set C and higher antigenic affinity, the 
higher the number of clones generated for each of 
the n selected.

(iii) Calculate the initial affinity 
One of the key elements to AIS is to determine the 
affinity measurement of antibodies and antigens. In this 
paper, the similarity measure which is computed as the 
Euclidean spatial distance is used as the affinity measure. 
Thus, the affinity of the antibody can be expressed as 
Equation (1): 
 (1) 
 
Dip here is the distance between the p-th antigen, which 
is also the i-th pixel value of the input data MR image, 
and the center of the i-th population (antibody). C is the 
number of antibodies in the antibody set, and Z is the 
total number of pixels in the image.  
 
(iv) Selection and differentiation  
After the affinity is computed, a selection is performed 
to retain those sets of antibodies of high affinity values. 
In our experiment, 5 of the 9 antibodies of higher 
affinities (regarded as superior antibodies) are selected 
for producing next generation. After the screening is 
finished, each selected antigen is assigned a number of 
Clones according to its affinity value. In order to 
compute the number of clones, these five retaining 
antibodies are first ranked from 1 to 5, with 1 being the 
one of the highest affinity value and 5 being the lowest 
affinity. Then the number of clones produced from the 
antibody of rank number k is computed as equation (2): 
 (2) 
 
Where Nc is the total number of clones generated, β is a 
multiplying factor, N is the total number of antibodies, 
and k is the rank of the target antibody. Suppose N = 9 
and β  with rank i = 1) 
will produce 9 clones, while the second highest antibody 
produces 5 clones, the third highest affinity antibody 
produces 3 clones, and so on. According to AIS an 
antibody with higher affinity congenital has relatively 
higher probability to keep its gene through more number 
of clones produced from it; On the other hand, 
antibodies with lower affinity congenital could be 
eliminated relatively easily. 
 
(v) Muturate 
Muturate is equivalent to the mutation in Genetic 
Algorithms. It is a very important step in the artificial 
immune system for increasing some individuals’ affinity. 
This is also an important procedure in solving the local 
optimum solution. The Muturate in AIS is based on the 
following principle: the higher affinity an antibody is 
with, the lower muturate rate it will perform. Thus the 
antibody will have a higher probability of retaining its 
original genes. In order to decide whether a mutation 
should be conducted in statistical sense, this paper 
employs a normal distribution, as described in the 
following.  
In order to describe normal distribution, two 
parameters are required, which are mean value μ and the 
variance σ2. The mean value μ determines the center 
position of the distribution, and variance σ2 determines 
the range of distribution. In this experiment, the mean 
value μ of the normal distribution is set to 0, and the 
variance σ2 is set to 1.  
 
(vi) Calculate affinity  
After the muturate is finished, the affinities are re-
calculated on the new generation of antibodies obtained 
following muturate. For each group, we then look for 
those individuals generated from maturate and having 
higher affinity than its previous generation. These higher 
affinity individuals will be retained in the next iteration 
for further maturate. If a group does not produce a better 
individual, this group will be kept unchanged. 
 
(vii) Keep diversity 
During our previous step of recalculating affinity, we 
can keep the superior individuals by replacing the 
original individual with the new one of higher affinity 
values. However, the individuals with lower affinity 
during the initial affinity calculation will not be 
discarded immediately. But, some mechanisms will be 
applied to re-investigate these individuals. If an 
individual can achieve a relatively high affinity 
revealing a potential, it will be given an opportunity to 
participate in the competition. This process guarantees 
the diversity of the antibodies.  
 
5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
In order to test the performance of the approach, both 
computer-generated phantom images (simulate brain 
MRIs) and the real brain MRIs are adopted for 
evaluation.   
The computer-generated phantom images have five 
bands, as shown in Figure 7, each of which have the 
same size of and were made up of six overlapped 
ellipses. The total number of image pixels is 65536. 
These ellipses represent structure areas of three 
interesting cerebral tissues corresponding to gray matter 
(GM), white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid 
(CSF). In Figure 7 from the periphery to the center are 
background (BKG), GM, WM and CSF. The gray level 
values of these areas in each band were simulated such 
that these values reflect the average values of their 
respective tissues in real MR images shown in Figure 10. 
In order to assess the robustness of the algorithm, 
Gaussian noises are added in the simulated brain MRIs.

Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the classification rate and 
false alarm rate for the simulated images with 10dB and 
5dB SNR, respectively, when AIS-CSA is applied. In 
order for comparison, FCM and two-layered Perceptron 
neural network are also applied on the same images. The 
results using Perceptron neural network are shown in 
Tables 3 and 4, while those using FCM are shown in 
Tables 5 and 6.  
From these results, we can see that CSA is slightly 
superior to perceptron neural networks and FCM in 
classifying the simulated brain MRIs. Despite that FCM 
method has 0.04% higher classification rate than CSA 
method for the 10db SNR images, when the data have 
lower SNR (5dB) the CSA presents better performance.  
We also apply the CSA method to real brain MRIs, 
one of examples shown in Figure 10. The parameters of 
this image are TR1/TE1=2500ms/20ms, 
TR2/TE2=1500ms/55ms, TR3/TE3=2500ms/75ms, 
TR4/TE4=2500ms/100ms, TR5/TE5 =500ms/20ms. 
The classification results by CSA are shown in Figure 
11. From the results, we can see that the AIS-CSA 
presents a good potential in classification of MR images.
