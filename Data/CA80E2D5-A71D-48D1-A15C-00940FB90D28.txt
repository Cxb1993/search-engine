set to 8.3%, 25.5%, 33.3% and 41.7%, respectively, and kept at a constant total working pressure of 0.47 Pa. 
The deposition parameters of the Cr-B-N coatings in second stage are listed in Table 2. 
The cross-sectional morphologies of thin films were examined with a field emission scanning electron 
microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6701, JEOL, Japan). Selected thin films were further analyzed by TEM to reveal 
the microstructures in details. Chemical compositions of thin films were analyzed with a field emission 
electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL, Japan). The phases of thin films were explored 
by a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer (XRD, XRD-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) with an incidence angle of 2o. 
Cu Kα radiation generated at 30 kV and 20 mA from a Cu target was used. The Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR, Spectrum One, Perkin-Elmer, USA) measurement was performed to explore the type of 
chemical bonds of the BN structure of each Cr-B-N thin film. The FTIR spectrum background of each coating 
was subtracted from the spectrum of uncoated Si wafer. The hardness and elastic modulus of thin films were 
investigated by means of a nanoindenter (TI-900, TriboIndenter, Hysitron, USA) using a Berkovich 142.3° 
diamond probe at a maximum applied load of 3 mN. 
 
3.Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Compositions and crystalline structures of Cr-B-N thin films 
The chemical composition of each coating is listed in Table 3. For A series coatings, the boron content 
increases monotonically from 3.7 at.% (A1) to 20.6 at% (A7), whereas the chromium content decreases from 
39.8 at.% (A1) to 20.4 at% (A7). On the other hand, the nitrogen content of each coating is almost the same, 
which is around 55 at.%. For B series thin films, the nitrogen content increased rapidly with increasing fN2 and 
became saturated at around 53.0 at.% for higher nitrogen gas flow rate, i.e., fN2 > 33.3%. In general, the 
chemical concentrations of chromium and boron decreased with increasing fN2.  
The X-ray diffraction patterns of series A and B coatings are shown in Fig.1 (a) and (b), respectively. 
Crystalline CrN phase can be observed for each coating depicted in Fig. 1(a). No XRD signals corresponding 
to BN and CrB2 phases are found. The peak intensities decrease and broaden as the boron content of series A 
coating increases. Clearly, the grain size of Cr-B-N coating in series A decreases with increasing boron 
content. In Fig. 1(b), the evolutions of peak intensities are strongly influenced by the fN2 and nitrogen contents 
of the films. When a limited amount of nitrogen, fN2 =8.3% was purged during sputtering, an amorphous-like 
or extremely fine-scale XRD diffraction pattern was found for the B1 coating. A similar result was also 
observed for sample B2 as nitrogen content increased to 40.7 at.% and fN2 increased to 25.5 %. Meanwhile, 
very broad XRD peaks corresponding to a CrN phase are obtained for the B3 and B4 coatings, which were 
deposited at fN2 higher than 33.3%. It has been reported that the addition of nitrogen into Cr-B films will 
induce the nucleation of BN and CrxN phases, and thus decrease their grain size dramatically [3]. In this work, 
the grain refinement effect by boron addition in the Cr-B-N thin film is confirmed. 
The FTIR technique was employed to investigate the existence of amorphous BN phase in the coating. 
According to the FTIR absorption spectrum of series A and B coatings depicted in Figs. 2(a) and (b), 
respectively, the intensities of h-BN characteristic peaks at 780 cm-1 increase with increasing boron and 
nitrogen contents, indicating the existence of amorphous h-BN phase. Meanwhile, no characteristic peak of 
c-BN at 1060 cm-1 is found [7, 8]. 
 
3.2 Microstructure of Cr-B-N thin films

and modulus. Finally, It can be concluded that the A1 coating containing Cr-3.7 at.%B-54.6 at.% N exhibits 
the optimal mechanical properties due to its fine columnar structure in this work. 
 
4.Conclusions 
In this work, two series of Cr–B–N thin films containing various boron and nitrogen concentrations were 
investigated. The amount of amorphous h-BN phase increased with increasing boron and nitrogen contents 
based on the FTIR analysis. It can be concluded that the boron and nitrogen elements showed strong influence 
on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Cr-B-N thin films. The hardness, elastic modulus and H/E 
ratio increased with increasing nitrogen content. On the other hand, the hardness, elastic modulus and H/E 
ratio decreased with increasing boron content, which was possibly attributed to the microstructure of Cr-B-N 
coatings containing small nanocrystallites and thick intergranular amorphous BN phase. The optimal 
mechanical properties was achieved on the fine columnar structured Cr-3.7 at.%B-54.6 at.% N thin film.

在敝人擔任通訊作者的論文報告中，第一篇文章題目為「The Influence of Bilayer Period and 
Thickness Ratio on the Mechanical and Tribological Properties of CrSiN/TiAlN Multilayer 
Coatings」，為敝人指導東南科大機電所碩士學生吳孟科同學之成果，由吳孟科同學親自上台口
頭報告，探討以反應式脈衝直流磁控濺鍍法鍍製七種不同雙層周期厚度之 CrSiN/TiAlN 奈米多層
薄膜。本研究利用分析薄膜表面與截面形貌，利用奈米壓痕儀、微小維克式硬度儀及 pin-on-disk
磨耗試驗機分析其薄膜之機械性質。由實驗結果發現，七種奈米多層薄膜之雙層週期厚度皆控制
在 5-40nm，且雙層週期厚度等於 12nm 時，硬度與抗塑性變形能力皆達到最大值，雙層週期厚
度在 6nm 時，具有最低之磨耗係數。而雙層週期厚度在 30nm 時，具有最佳之破斷韌性。由於
反應式脈衝直流濺鍍技術在工業愈來愈受到重視，具有增加鍍膜速率、抑制電弧放電與提升鍍膜
品質等優點，因此當吳同學報告結束之後，吸引相當多來自國內外的學者專家的提問與繼續討
論。由於吳同學事先多次訓練，因此英文報告內容尚屬流利，雖然對於現場聽眾提出的問題反應
不過來，但是也已經難能可貴，畢竟從台灣來的碩士班學生有勇氣上台報告非常稀少。 
第二篇文章題目為「Microstructure and Mechanical Properties Evaluation of Pulsed DC 
Magnetron Sputtered Cr-B and Cr-B-N Films」，是敝人指導東南科大機電所碩士班鄭智鴻同學的成
果，也是敝人國科會計畫的主軸，本研究藉著改變氮氣流量比例來鍍製不同氮含量的Cr-B 與
Cr-B-N薄膜，並從結晶特性、微結構與機械性質來分析不同氮含量對薄膜特性的影響，本論文由
敝人的恩師清大杜正恭教授口頭報告；由於鄭同學做了不少TEM分析，因此有許多極高倍率的
截面微結構影像，可以充分說明加入氮氣達特定比例之後，在Cr-B-N薄膜所形成的奈米複合結構
型貌，以及奈米複合結構當中，若是非晶質的氮化硼相太多所造成的軟化現象；由於報告內容豐
富，因此也獲得不少與會者的回響與討論。 
第三篇文章題目為「Mechanical Properties, Tribological and Corrosion Resistance Evaluation of 
Cathodic Arc Deposited ZrN/CrN Multilayer Coatings」，是敝人指導台灣科技大學機械所碩士學生
陳曉帆同學之成果，也是與產學合作廠商國碩科技工業公司合作的內容，由敝人親自上台報告。
本研究討論以陰極電弧法鍍製五種不同雙層周期厚度，自5~30nm之CrN/ZrN奈米多層薄膜之微結
 5
孔硬化機制談起，該磊晶成長薄膜的硬度隨著 x 值從 1 降至 0.67 而顯著提高，但是彈性係數與
鬆弛晶格常數則隨之線性降低，薄膜之電阻值則因為電子在氮原子空孔位置散射，從 13μΩ-cm
增加到 192 μΩ-cm。相對的，5d 族的 TaNx (001)的硬度、彈性係數與電阻值則幾乎無變化。與
TiN 與 TaN 相較，3d 族的 ScN (001)則為透明半導體薄膜，其Γ-X 間接能隙為 1.3eV，其 X-點直
接能隙為 2.4 eV，因此根據 Sc1-xTix(001)薄膜的反射率分析，可以獲得多色彩範圍的硬質薄膜。
而自組裝超硬奈米結構，例如奈米多層結構、奈米柱狀結構、奈米球與奈米管等結構可以大幅提
升過渡金屬氮化物薄膜及相關材料的性質。形成自組裝奈米結構的方法則包括控制的相分離、表
面誘導的離相分解(spinodal decomposition)、表面偏析(surface segregation)誘導的再成核、應變誘
導韌化、表面異向性與動態再濺射率增強等等。最後 Greene 教授以 Ti-B-N 薄膜為例，該薄膜具
有高溫硬化現象，亦即在高溫時具有奈米結構而增強其機械性質。綜合敝人數次聆聽 Greene 教
授演講的經驗，他的演講內容非常精彩，說明很清晰詳細，但是速度卻是很快，讓人目不暇，若
是稍有問題就容易讓人趕不上他的演講內容，因此雖然他講的內容有許多是我們所熟知的專業知
識，但是還是極具有啟發性與創新性，不禁讓我們再次折服於大師風範。 
在這個星期中，敝人亦聽取許多論文的口頭報告並於星期四晚上看了不少海報論文，例如星
期一(5/2)上午 11 時 20 分在 E-3-1-5 場次的邀請演講，由 Goto 教授報告「Design and deposition of 
amorphous carbon nanocomposite coatings for tribological application」，討論有關耐磨應用的非晶
質碳奈米複合薄膜的設計與鍍製，Goto 教授提到將低剪模數的金屬摻雜到類鑽石(DLC)膜當中可
有效降低殘留應力。他們使用 CVD 與 PVD 的複合製程製作奈米複合薄膜；由實驗結果發現，
妥善選擇前驅物、金屬摻雜物質與鍍膜條件可以獲得極佳之奈米複合微結構，而獲得極佳之耐磨
耗能力的類鑽石(DLC)薄膜。 
星期一下午 15 時 30 分在 B4-2-10 場次為北京清華大學博士班學生報告「Bonding structures 
and mechanical properties of silicon doped carbon nitride films」，這場也是本次學生論文獎的入圍
者報告，因此吸引許多人聽講，作者利用離子束輔助沉積(IBAD)技術鍍製 SiCN 薄膜，由於碳氮
化物的硬度僅在 30GPa 以下，加入矽元素可以促進薄膜的機械性質；該研究的 SiCN 薄膜的一次
厚度約為 250nm，矽含量為 0~53 at.%，採用具有成分梯度分佈的一次鍍膜方法。當矽含量為 39 
at.%，薄膜硬度可高達 66GPa，而矽含量為 53 at.%，薄膜硬度則降低至 26 GPa，具有 C1S，N1S，
Si2P 等鍵結。然而在敝人與其他與會者相繼提出一些硬度測量問題之後，發現該研究仍有一些
需要再確認之處，因此其結果的再現性是否足夠仍是疑問，實屬有些可惜。不過這個中國大陸博
士班學生的報告還是值得我們台灣來的學生學習，畢竟願意參與學生論文競賽，並且被選入前三
名，還能夠上台侃侃而談也是不容易的事。 
星期二(5/3)上午 8 時 20 分在 B4-3-3 場次的邀請演講，由法國 Pierson 教授報告「In situ 
structural characterization of TM-Si-N and TM-B-N coatings during air oxidation」，他使用 XRD、 
Raman 與 FTIR 等設備進行 Fe-Si-N、Nb-Si-N、Cr-B-N 等薄膜的高溫氧化研究，提到 CrB2的抗
溫性質可達 600oC，他也提出以 FTIR 分析判斷 B-O 與 B-OH 等鍵結的方法，以及在這些薄膜氧
化層的可能結構等等實驗結果；由於敝人自今年起以 Cr-B-N 等硼氮化合物薄膜為研究對象，因
此對此演講仔細聆聽，收穫非常豐富。

relative thickness ratios of CrSiN to TiAlN were synthesized by a reactive pulsed DC magnetron 
sputtering system. The effect of Λ values and thickness ratios of CrSiN to TiAlN layers on the 
microstructures, mechanical, toughness and tribological properties of coatings are discussed in this 
paper. Suitable microstructure design to an optimal mechanical properties and tribological 
performance is also proposed. 
2. Experimental Procedure 
Two series of CrSiN/TiAlN multilayered thin films were deposited on p-type (100) silicon 
wafer substrates by a bipolar asymmetry pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering system. The first 
series (denoted as L series) included seven multilayered coatings with the same thickness ratios of 
CrSiN: TiAlN= 1:1 and different bilayer periods. The second series (denoted as T series) were two 
multilayered coatings fabricated with the same Λ value, 20 nm and different thickness ratios of 
CrSiN: TiAlN, which were 2:8 and 8:2, respectively. Detailed description of the sputtering method has 
been reported elsewhere [10]. In this work, the 90Cr-10Si and 64Ti-36Al (both in wt.%) alloy 
targets were in opposite positions and substrates were mounted on two sides of a rotating barrel 
between two targets. Multilayers were deposited by alternately rotating the substrates between the 
plasma of 90Cr-10Si and 64Ti-36Al targets. Various bilayer periods were achieved by controlling 
the holding time of substrates in the plasma stream from 90Cr-10Si or 64Ti-36Al target. The 
deposition time of each coating was controlled to achieve a fixed thickness around 1μm. The 
starting nitride layer and the uppermost layer were TiAlN and CrSiN coatings, respectively, for all 
specimens. Sample designation and typical deposition conditions for the L and T series coatings are 
listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. 
Chemical compositions of coatings were analyzed with a field emission electron probe 
microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL, Japan) with a ZAF-corrected program. The surface 
morphology and surface roughness of each coating were investigated by an AFM (DI 3100, Bruker, 
USA). The cross-sectional morphologies of coatings were examined with a field emission FE-SEM 
(JSM-6701F, JEOL, Japan) and TEM (JSM-2010, JEOL, Japan). Glancing angle X-ray 
diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) with an incidence angle of 2owas utilized to study the 
crystal structures of each coating, respectively.  
The nanohardness and elastic modulus of multilayered thin films were investigated by means 
of a nanoindenter (TI-900, TriboIndenter, Hysitron, USA) using a Berkovich 142.3° diamond probe 
at a maximum applied load of 5 mN. A micro Vickers hardness tester was used to further evaluate 
the fracture toughness, KIC, of coatings based on the following equation [11]: 
)
c
P(
H
EK 3/2IC δ=    (1) 
where P is the applied indentation load and δ is an indenter geometry constant, equal to 4 N and 
0.016, respectively, for a Vickers diamond pyramid indenter. E, H and c are elastic modulus, 
hardness and radial crack length of the coating, respectively. The radial crack length was evaluated 
using a SEM. 
A pin-on-disk wear method was used to investigate the wear resistance of coatings. A 
cemented tungsten carbide (WC + 6 wt.% Co) ball, 5 mm in diameter was adopted as the stationary 
pin. A normal load of 1 N was applied. The sliding speed was 27.2 mm/s with a wear track diameter 
of 8 mm. The test temperature was 20oC, and the relative humidity was kept at 60%. The wear time 
was 40 min for each test. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Compositions and microstructure characterizations of CrSiN/TiAlN multilayers 
 4
period is presented in Fig 6(a). The hardness values of monolayer TiAlN and CrSiN coatings, both 
around 29 GPa, are also inserted. Apparently, the hardness values of multilayered coatings, except 
L6, are all higher than that of monolayer TiAlN or CrSiN. It is also found that the hardness levels 
off at Λ=12-40 nm and reaches a maximum value at Λ= 10 nm and, followed by a drastic decrease 
when the bilayer periods decreases to less than 10 nm. A maximum hardness, 31 GPa, was observed 
for the L10 coating with a 10 nm bilayer period, whereas a minimum hardness, 28 GPa, was found 
for the L6 coating. As compared with the hardness results reported in previous work [10], a 
decrease of maximum hardness around 4 GPa is observed in this study, which is primary attributed 
to different CrSiN/TiAlN thickness ratio in this work. On the other hand, the elastic modulus of 
each multilayered coating is between the values of TiAlN and CrSiN coatings, which is also 
different from previous report [10] due to different thickness ratio produced in this study. The 
tendency of hardness versus bilayer period is not found on the elastic modulus values. Since 
Leyland and Matthews [13] discovered that the H/E ratio is an important factor to describe the 
resistance of materials against elastic strain to failure, the H/E ratio of each coating is also plotted in 
Fig. 6. The similar tendency of H/E ratio versus bilayer period is also found. However, a maximum 
value, 0.101 was obtained for L8 coating. The lowest value, 0.077, is found for the monolayer 
TiAlN. Again, the resistance against elastic strain to failure of each multilayered coating was higher 
than that of single layer TiAlN and was more or less equal to CrSiN coating.  
The fracture toughness versus the bilayer period of L series coatings is shown in Fig. 6(b). A 
little bit different tendency is observed as compared with other mechanical properties of 
multilayered coatings. In general, the fracture toughness increases with decreasing bilayer periods, 
except the L12 coating. A maximum value, 1.7 MPa m , is obtained for L6 coating. 
On the other hand, the hardness, elastic modulus, H/E and fracture toughness for T series 
coatings are shown in Figs 7. Apparently, the hardness, elastic modulus and H/E ratio of T series 
coating increase with increasing thickness of TiAlN layer. The maximum hardness of T series 
coating reaches to 35 GPa as the CrSiN: TiAlN thickness ratio is 2:8. On the other hand, the 
fracture toughness for T2 coating (CrSiN: TiAlN thickness ratio is 8:2) was not obtained because 
either no cracking was found under 4 N loads or film was broken under higher indentation load. 
Nevertheless, an increasing tendency of the toughness with respect to the thickness ratio of TiAlN 
to CrSiN is also observed. 
The multilayered nitride coating is characterized for its specific strengthening effect when the 
bilayer periods reach to a given point and then decreased as bilayer periods increase or decrease 
[1-4]. Based on the phenomena of dislocation blockage by interfaces, Koehler theory [14] or the 
alternating-stress strengthening theory [15] is often used to explain the hardness enhancement of 
nanoscale multilayered coatings. According to the calculation in previous study [10], a maximum 
hardness enhancement of 2 GPa compared with monolayer TiAlN can be found in this work. It is 
noticeable that a higher value, around 5 GPa enhancement was found in previous work for the 
coating with Λ=12 nm and the CrSiN: TiAlN thickness ratio was 2:8.  
Research work on the dependence of individual layer thickness on the hardness enhancement 
effect of TiAlN/CrN multilayered coating was limited and showed contradiction results [2, 3, 7, 16, 
17]. According to the research work by Chu and Barnett [3], varying the individual layer 
thicknesses had relatively little effect on the strength enhancement. However, a peak hardness 
around 45GPa was reported for the single-crystal TiN/VN superlattices coating when the Λ=6.5 
nm and the TiN layer thickness (lTiN) and bilayer period ratio, lTiN/Λ, was 0.3 [2]. Further increase 
or decrease the lTiN/Λ ratio will decrease the hardness of multilayered coating. Meanwhile, for the 
 6
coating at fixed Λ=20 nm, the hardness, toughness and H/E values increased with increasing 
thickness ratio of TiAlN/CrSiN. 
It is concluded that for the multilayered coating at 10 nm bilayer period and equal individual 
layer thickness ratio, a combination of excellent mechanical properties, tribological performance 
and adequate toughness including an average hardness of 31 GPa, elastic modulus of 320 GPa and 
low COF of 0.49 have been achieved in this work.

Abstract 
The CrB2 and four Cr–B–N films with high Cr/B ratio and various nitrogen contents were 
deposited by a co-sputtering process using a bipolar asymmetric pulsed DC reactive magnetron 
sputtering system. The structures and BN bonding nature of thin films were characterized by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. The surface 
and cross sectional morphologies of thin films were examined by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface roughness of thin films was 
explored by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanoindenter, nanoscratch and nanowear 
techniques were used to evaluate the hardness, and nanotribological properties of thin films, 
respectively.  
The microstructure of Cr-B-N thin films changed from coarse columnar structure to glassy and 
featureless morphology as the nitrogen flow ratio, fN2 increased from 8.3 % to 41.7%, whereas the 
corresponding phase developed from amorphous state to nanocomposite structure consisting CrN 
nanograins and amorphous BN phases. It was found that a high hardness, good nanotribological and 
brittle properties were obtained on the CrB2 coating. The hardness and elastic modulus of Cr-B-N 
thin films decreased with increasing fN2 until the nanocomposite CrN nano grains formed. However, 
the hardening effect brought by the nanocomposite coating was limited due to the small CrN 
nanograins were surrounded by thick intergranular soft h-BN layer. On the other hand, the 
toughness and resistance against elastic strain to failure of Cr-B-N coatings were effectively 
enhanced by the addition of nitrogen.

1. Introduction 
Recently, research work on nanocomposite coatings for tribological applications has been 
studied extensively [1-4]. Among several elements added into transition metal nitride system, boron 
is an active element to form boron nitride and borides, which is further characterized for its high 
efficiency to produce a nanocomposite structure. Since the CrB2 thin film exhibits remarkable high 
hardness, high melting temperature and inert chemical property, the effect of nitrogen addition on 
the mechanical and tribological properties of Cr-B-N coating has attracted lots of attentions from 
researchers and industries. The Cr-B-N thin films deposited under different nitrogen partial pressure 
have been investigated thoroughly in literature [5-18]. The phase, microstructure, corresponding 
mechanical and tribological properties of the Cr-B-N coating are strongly influenced by the 
processing parameters and nitrogen gas ratio during deposition. In previous work, the fabrication of 
Cr-B-N coatings was always made by using a CrB2 compound target [5, 9-11, 13, 14, 16, 17] , 
which limited the chemical composition range of Cr-B-N coating, or using a Cr-B target with 
specific chemical composition [6, 8, 12, 15] or using pure Cr and B targets [7, 18], which made it 
expensive than usual. In this work, a co-sputtering process using a CrB2 compound target and a pure 
 16
Three scratch tests were conducted on each coating. Reciprocating nanowear test under 2000 μN 
normal load was executed on each film to explore the nanotribological property. Wear tests 
consisted of generating scratches in a reciprocatory mode at a given load for 21 cycles over a scan 
length (stroke length) of 4 μm at 0.4 μm/s. Similarly, forces and displacements in the normal and 
lateral directions were monitored as a function of number of cycles. AFM impressions of indents, 
nanoscratch and nanowear tracks were taken with the identical diamond tip.  
A Vickers micro hardness tester was further adopted to evaluate the toughness, K, of thin films 
based on the following equation [21]: 
H
E)
c
P(K 3/2δ=    (1) 
where P is the applied indentation load and δ is an indenter geometry constant, equal to 1.5-2.5 N 
and 0.016, respectively, for a Vickers diamond pyramid indenter. E and H are elastic modulus and 
hardness derived from nanoindentation tests. And c is the average of the radial crack lengths 
occurring on the thin films, which was evaluated using a FE-SEM. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Composition and phase characterization of CrB2 and Cr-B-N thin films 
The chemical composition of each coating as a function of fN2 is plotted in Fig.1 (a). It is 
obvious that the nitrogen content increased rapidly with increasing fN2 and became saturated at 
around 54 at.% for fN2 > 33.3%. In general, the chemical compositions of Cr and B decreased with 
increasing fN2. However, as compared with B0, the Cr content is higher for B1 coating due to the 
co-sputtering process using CrB2 and Cr targets in this work. Fig. 1(b) further illustrates the 
correlation between Cr, B concentrations and nitrogen flow ratio, fN2. Apparently, a linear decrease 
of Cr and B contents with respect to fN2 is clearly found. The Cr/B ratio is 0.53 for B0 coating and 
increases to 1.15 as fN2 = 8.3% and stabilizes at around 1.51 for higher fN2 A similar linear 
concentration ratio was reported by Gorishnyy et al. [9] except that the Cr/B ratios are higher in this 
work owing to the two targets co-sputtering process.  
The chemical compositions of CrB2 and Cr-B-N thin films as determined by FE-EPMA in 
respect to the ternary Cr-B-N phase diagram [22] are shown in Fig. 2. The positions of Cr-B-N 
coatings are located along with the central perpendicular line of ternary phase diagram and shift 
toward the corner of nitrogen with increasing fN2. As compared with other research results, quite 
different chemical compositions of Cr-B-N coatings were achieved in this work. 
It should be noticed that the oxygen content of each coating is around 1 to 2 at.%, except 
sample B2, which consists about 6 at.% oxygen. The oxygen contamination in the Cr-B-N coating 
was also reported elsewhere [14], which was attributed to the CrB2 target. Furthermore, the strong 
affinity of B and Cr to oxygen is also a possible reason. 
Figure 3 illustrates the X-ray diffraction patterns of all films. No XRD signals corresponding 
to BN are found. The evolutions of peak intensities are strongly influenced by the fN2 and nitrogen 
contents of the films. For the B0 coating, a pure CrB2 phase is observed. When limited amount of 
nitrogen, fN2 =8.3% was purged during sputtering, amorphous-like or nanocrystalline-structured 
XRD diffraction pattern is found for the B1 coating. A similar result is also observed for the sample 
B2 as fN2 increased to 25.5 %. Meanwhile, very broad XRD peaks corresponding to CrN phase are 
obtained on the B3 and B4 coatings, which were deposited at fN2 higher than 33.3%. The calculated 
average grain size of B3 and B4 are 3.8 and 3.4 nm, respectively, by the Scherrer formula using the 
integral width of the Bragg reflection [20]. It is reported that the addition of nitrogen into the Cr-B 
films will induce the nucleation of BN and CrxN phases, and thus decrease their grain size 
 18
According to the diffraction pattern of B4 coating shown in Fig. 7(a), the dominant crystal phase is 
CrN. These strong diffuse rings representing either a very fine nano crystalline structure or 
amorphous structure is achieved. The dark filed image in Fig. 7(a) indicates that the B4 coating 
consists of randomly distributed CrN nanograins with a very small grain size. The high resolution 
TEM micrograph of B4 coating is further revealed in Fig. 7(b). The two phases nanocomposite 
structure consisting of CrN nanograins around 2-3 nm in diameter surrounded by amorphous matrix, 
the h-BN phase is clearly seen. In literature, detailed TEM microstructure analysis on the Cr-B-N 
thin films deposited at different nitrogen partial pressure was conducted by Hegedűs et al. [17] and 
very similar result was also reported. Sharp columnar and nano crystalline structures were also 
found in the CrB2 films and Cr-B-N films containing more than 9 at.% nitrogen, respectively [16]. 
They reported that microstructures of Cr-B-N coatings can be either single CrB2 phase or two phase 
morphology or cubic CrN nanocrystalline structure when the nitrogen content was in the low, 
medium and high range [16]. The amorphous BN phase was always observed for the Cr-B-N thin 
films containing medium and high nitrogen content. Similarly, a nano crystalline structure with CrN 
nanograins around 1-3 nm in diameter embedded in the amorphous born nitride matrix was also 
revealed in their study [16].  
Apparently, comparing the microstructure evolution of thin films B0 and B4 as shown in Figs. 
6 and 7, the influence of nitrogen addition on the grain size refinement of Cr-B-N films is obvious. 
The introducing of nitrogen into the deposition process shows a pronounced suppression of 
columnar growth. 
3.3 Mechanical and nanotribological properties evaluation of thin films 
The relationship between average hardness, elastic modulus and nitrogen flow ratio, fN2, 
for all films are shown in Fig. 8. For the CrB2 film (B0), the highest hardness and elastic 
modulus around 29 and 325 GPa were obtained, respectively, due to its dense nanocolumnar 
structure and strong covalent bond of boride thin film [17]. On the other hand, the hardness 
and elastic modulus of Cr-B-N coatings decreases with increasing fN2. However, the hardness 
and elastic modulus of Cr-B-N coatings increases again when the fN2 is higher than 35.5% and 
reaches to 20 and 221 GPa in hardness and elastic modulus, respectively, for B4 coating. It is 
suggested that the softening of Cr-B-N film with increasing nitrogen content is caused by the 
soft amorphous h-BN phase and then strengthened again by the formation of CrN nanograins 
and corresponding nanocomposite structure. In addition, the lowest hardness and elastic 
modulus values are observed in the B2 coating, which is possibly attributed to its high B and N 
contents (20 at.% B and 46.3 at.% N) to form the largest volume fraction of soft h-BN phase 
than other coatings. The high oxygen contamination for B2 coating is another possible reason 
for its poor mechanical properties. 
For the nanocomposite coating, the hardness is directly linked to the nature of 
nanostructure. The ideal interaction between the nanocrystallites and surrounding amorphous 
phase was suggested by Patscheider et al. [26] and Vepřek et al. [4]. The hardness of 
nanocomposite is affected by a complex interaction of orientation of nanocrystallites, size of 
nanograins and the separation of the nanocrystallites by the surrounding amorphous phase [26]. 
In the superhard nanocomposite nc-TiN/a-Si3N4 thin film system, the peak hardness was 
obtained when the percentage of amorphous phase is around 20% [26]. It consisted of an 
appropriate nanostructure which hindered the growth and propagation of dislocations and 
microcracks. Its rather high thermally stable nanostructure is attributed to its immiscible 
phases and the formation of a 1-2 monolayer, around 0.5 nm thick a-Si3N4 grain boundary 
 20
its simplicity. Figure 12 illustrates the average toughness, K, of the CrB2 and Cr-B-N thin films 
versus the nitrogen flow ratio. The H/E ratio is also calculated and plotted in Fig. 8 since it is an 
important factor to describe the resistance of materials against elastic strain to failure [28]. This 
value, where H and E are the hardness and modulus of each film achieved from nanoindentation 
tests, respectively. 
It is obvious that the lowest toughness, 1.1 MPa m  is found for the hardest CrB2 coating. 
The toughness of coating increases with increasing fN2 and reaches to the maximum value of 1.9 
MPa m  for B4 coating. Again, the toughness enhancement by the addition of nitrogen in the 
Cr-B-N film is observed. Meanwhile, the H/E ratio decreases with increasing fN2 and increases to 
the maximum value, 0.09 as the fN2 is 41.7%. It is found that the H/E ratio has a similar tendency as 
compared with the toughness value, except for the B0 coating, which exhibits the highest H/E ratio. 
Among the Cr-B-N coatings, the high hardness combined with the low elastic modulus gives rise to 
the highest H/E value of 0.09 for B4 coating, The surface morphologies of the microindentation 
craters for B0 and B4 coatings, which were deformed under 1.5 N and 2.5 N are depicted in Figs. 
13(a) and (b), respectively. It is obvious that the size of indent for B0 coating is smaller due to its 
high hardness and lower indentation loading; however, the average lateral crack length is much 
longer than that of B4 coating as shown in Fig. 13(b), which makes the toughness value to be the 
lowest of all. Although the H/E ratio, the resistance of materials against elastic strain to failure is the 
highest of all for B0 coating, the brittleness of the covalent bonded CrB2 coating can be revealed 
from this toughness evaluation as shown in Figs 12 and 13. 
4. Conclusions 
In this work, the pure Cr and CrB2 compound targets were used to co-sputter the Cr-B-N thin 
films with high Cr/B rations under different nitrogen flow ratio. By adjusting the nitrogen flow ratio 
during deposition process, the microstructure, phase, chemical composition and mechanical 
properties of Cr-B-N coatings can be controlled. A dense and fine columnar structure around 40-50 
nm wide was obtained for the CrB2 coating, which exhibited the maximum hardness, 29 GPa, the 
lowest friction coefficient and the best wear resistance. The hardness of Cr-B-N coating decreased 
as fN2 increased from 0 to 25.5%, which was caused by the increasing amount of soft h-BN phase. 
The microstructure of the Cr-B-N coating changed from columnar to nanocomposite structures as 
the fN2 increased. A further increase of fN2 to 41.4% would change the phase into a nanocomposite 
structure consisting of CrN nanograins around 2-3 nm in diameter surrounded by amorphous h-BN 
intergranular layer. However, the hardness of Cr-B-N coating was only strengthened to 20 GPa due 
to too much soft h-BN phase and large intergranular separation layer between CrN nanocrystallites. 
Meanwhile, the nanotribological properties of CrB2 and Cr-B-N coatings were not influenced by the 
amount of h-BN phase. Nevertheless, the toughness and the resistance against elastic strain to 
failure values of Cr-B-N coatings were effectively enhanced as fN2 increased.

was reported to be highly competitive with CVD and PVD methods [2]. 
Among various carbide coatings obtained by TRD method, the niobizing layer on steel 
exhibits high hardness [1, 3-7], good toughness [1], and excellent wear resistance [1, 3-7]. 
Successful industry application of the niobium carbide coated pins by TRD method to prevent 
soldering in aluminum die casting and a remarkable prolonged lifetime was also reported [1].  
Lots of efforts have been devoted to study the growth kinetics [1, 8-10], microstructures 
and mechanical properties [1, 3-7] on the TRD deposited niobium carbide coatings, but to the 
author’s knowledge, no report has been published on the detailed chemical compositions 
analysis and the nanomechanical properties evaluation of such coating. In this work, the 
elemental redistribution analysis, the nanoindentation technique, Daimler-Benz Rockwell-C 
adhesion test [11], scratch test and pin-on-disk wear test were integrated to explore the 
chemical composition, nanohardness, Young’s modulus, adhesion and tribological properties 
of niobized coatings. 
2. Experimental Procedure 
Commercial AISI H13 tool steel (Fe-5.0% Cr-1.25% Mo-1.0% V-1.0% Si-0.37%C, in 
wt.%) discs were selected as raw materials. Specimens with φ 30 x 8 mm in dimension were 
cut, abraded up to #1200 SiC paper, cleaned in distilled water, ultrasonically degreased in 
acetone and rinsed in alcohol. Specimens were niobized by immersion in a molten salt bath 
consisting of borax, 10 wt. % ferroniobium and 5 wt. % ferrovanadium powders to form a 
carbide coating mixture on the surface. The salt bath process was held at 900 oC for 2 hours 
and specimens were then quenched in oil directly.  
Scanning electron microscope was adopted to examine the surface and cross-sectional 
morphologies of niobized specimens. The elemental redistribution of niobizing coating was 
detected with an Field Emission Electron Probe Microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL 
JXA-8800M) by quantitative analysis of concentration for Fe, Nb, Cr, V, Mo, C, Si with the 
aid of a ZAF-corrected program. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) in 
conventional mode and in glancing angle mode with an incidence angle of 1o was adopted to 
study the crystal structures of coating. The nanohardness and elastic modulus of the coating 
and substrate were investigated on the cross-sectional specimen by means of a nanoindenter 
(TI-900 TriboIndenter, Hysitron, USA) using a Berkovich 142.3° diamond probe at a 
maximum applied load of 4 mN. The indentation depth was controlled to less than 120 nm to 
eliminate the substrate effect. The Daimler-Benz Rockwell-C (HRC-DB) adhesion test was 
used to assess the adhesion of coatings. The load of 1471N was applied to cause a coating 
damage adjacent to the boundary of the indentation. Three indentations were conducted. The 
damage to the coating was compared with the adhesion strength quality maps HF1 to HF6 
[11]. 
A scratch tester was used to carry out the scratch adhesion test. The adhesion strength is 
usually determined by the following terms: LC1 and LC2 [12]. LC1, the lower critical load, was 
defined as the load where first cracks occurred (cohesive failure). LC2, the upper critical load, 
was defined as the load where the first delamination at the edge of the scratch track occurred 
(adhesion failure). Three scratch tracks were tested with ramping loads up to 100 N. The 
friction coefficient was also determined.  
A dry pin-on-disk wear method was used to investigate the wear resistance of coating. 
The cemented tungsten carbide (WC+ 6 wt% Co) ball of 5 mm in diameter was adopted as the 
 34
substrate are 27.8±0.5 GPa, 378±8 GPa and 6.6±0.5GPa, 206±4 GPa, respectively. The 
hardness of the H13 substrate is in good agreement with the data obtained from a 
conventional Micro Vickers hardness tester. Figure 5(a) and (b) illustrate the atomic force 
microscope (AFM) image of nanoindentation craters on the carbide layer and H13 substrate, 
respectively. A smaller and shallow indent can be found in Fig. 5(a) indicating a high hardness 
value of the carbide layer. On the other hand, a deep and wider indent crater with apparent 
pile-up phenomenon can be seen in Fig. 5(b), which was tested under a lower load of 3 mN on 
H13 substrate. 
In literature, the hardness of thermo-reactive treated NbC layer was always evaluated by 
Micro Vickers or Micro Knoop hardness testers. Different hardness values of NbC carbides 
were reported, for example, about 2800 Hv [1], 2372±93 Hv on AISI D2 substrate [3], 2598 
Hv on AISI H13 substrate [5], 2664 Hv on AISI D2 substrate [5], 2333.3±56.4 Hv on AISI 
H13 substrate [6] and 2344.9±69.6 Hv on AISI M2 substrate [6]. On the other hand, the 
hardness values of pack method produced niobium carbide layers coated on AISI 1040 were 
1792±154 [4] and 2512±190 HK0.01 [7], respectively. As compared with the hardness data 
revealed above, the hardness of the mixed niobium carbide and vanadium carbide layer is a 
little bit higher, which can be caused by the mixture of  NbC and V8C7 carbides and also by 
the solid solution hardening effects of Fe and Cr atoms dissolved in carbides. Meanwhile, the 
precision indentation positioning and load control to prevent the substrate effect during 
nanoindentation test is also a possible reason. In addition, it is believed that this is the first 
report on the nanomechanical property and Young’s modulus results on the TRD deposited 
niobizing coating material. 
Adhesion property of niobizing steel was evaluated by HRC-DB adhesion test. The 
HRC-DB adhesion test is a quick, easy and standardized quality control method of hard 
coatings adopted by the industry. The strength quality HF1 to HF4 indicates a sufficient 
adhesion, whereas HF5 and HF6 represent insufficient adhesion [11]. Microstructure of 
indentation crater on niobized steel after the HRC-DB adhesion test are shown in Fig. 6 and 
almost no obvious failure can be observed. There is no radial crack or delamination, but only 
some very tiny circular bulge wrinkles are found through high magnification microscopic 
examinations. The adhesion strength quality is classified as HF1 accordingly.  
3.3 Scratch and wear properties  
Figures 7 (a) and (b) depict the surface morphologies of the scratch track where the LC1, 
the lower critical load and LC2, the upper critical load are indicated by arrows, respectively. 
The average LC1 and LC2 values of the niobizing layer are calculated to be 27.0 ±4.3 N and 
55.8±9.0 N, respectively. It can be seen that only very small cracks are found in the scratch 
track as shown in Fig. 7(a). The conformal cracking is observed in the scratch channel under 
the lower critical load, LC1. On the other hand, very tiny chipping failure is observed in Fig. 
7(b). It is important to point out that almost no severe chipping failures are observed when the 
scratch force exceeds the upper critical load, LC2. The surface morphology of the end of 
scratch track, which was under 88 to 100 N loads is also illustrated in Fig. 7(c). The adhesive 
failure is, however, caused by small amount of chippings near the end of the scratch track. 
Apparently, even a very heavy loading, 100N, was applied during the scratch test, only very 
limited chipping failures are observed for this niobizing specimen, which indicates an 
excellent adhesion property achieved in this work. The coefficient of friction against a 
diamond stylus versus scratch distance of three scratch tests is shown in Fig. 8. A very 
 36
pin-on-disk wear tests can be integrated to assess the mechanical and tribological properties of 
the niobized steel. The TRD treated niobium carbide and vanadium carbide mixture coating 
can provide very high hardness and Young’s modulus, excellent surface adhesion, good wear 
and scratch resistance for the AISI H13 steel. 
Conclusions: 
The thermo-reactive diffusion niobizing treatment on AISI H13 steel at 900 oC for 2 
hours had been carried out. The NbC and V8C7 mixed carbide layer with dense outer layer and 
porous-like inner layer was formed, which contained 48.1% Nb- 42.8%C- 4.0%V- 3.8%Fe 
and 36.7%Nb- 34.1%C -23.1%Fe -2.8%V (in at.%), respectively. The average hardness and 
Young’s modulus of the outer dense carbide layer were 27.8±0.5 GPa and 378±8 GPa, 
respectively. The adhesion strength quality of the niobized layer was ranked as HF1 and both 
the lower and upper critical loads of coating were also high, indicating that excellent adhesion 
property was achieved. The wear resistance of AISI H13 steel could be significantly improved 
by the niobizing process. In conclusion, the nanoindentation test, HRC-DB adhesion, scratch 
and wear tests revealed that the niobized H13 steel exhibited very high hardness and Young’s 
modulus, excellent surface adhesion, good wear/scratch resistance and promising tribological 
property, which can be applied in related industries.

Abstract 
Surface modification technology can be used to deposit a foreign hard coating material 
onto the surface of interest to achieve specific properties, such as high strength, adequate 
adhesion, wear and corrosion resistance. In this study, the Ti-Al and Cr-Si targets were used 
to fabricate the Ti-Al-Cr-Si-N nanocomposite thin films with various Cr and Si contents by a 
pulsed DC magnetron sputtering system. The crystalline structure of coatings was determined 
by a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer. The surface roughness of thin films was explored 
by an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of thin 
films were examined by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), respectively. The adhesion, hardness and nanotribological properties of 
thin films were evaluated by a nanoindenter and scratch tester respectively. The hardness and 
elastic modulus decreased with the increasing Cr and Si contents of Ti-Al-Cr-Si-N 
nanocomposite coatings. The toughness, H/E and nanotribological properties were enhanced 
by the Cr and Si contents of Ti-Al-Cr-Si-N nanocomposite coatings in this work.

1. Introduction 
Recently several nanocomposite and multilayer nitride coatings have been successfully 
developed due to the marked mechanical and electrochemical properties. To modify the 
performance of cutting tools, there has been an increasing interest in the topic of nitride 
coatings with superiorly hard, tough, and tribological properties. The ternary nitride coatings 
included Cr-Ti-N, Cr-Mo-N, and Cr-Si-N reveal better mechanical properties than binary 
nitride coatings [1-3]. The quaternary TiAlCrN coatings with high Al content present marked 
performance for high speed cutting application since that combine high hardness with 
oxidation resistance [4]. To further expand the functions of coatings, the silicon has been 
doped into nitride coatings to form nanocomposites structure. Thus, the Si-doped TiAlN, 
CrAlN, and TiCrN coatings have been reported due to the excellent performance in hardness, 
wear resistance, and thermal stability [5-7]. With Si incorporation, the TiCrAlN coatings have 
better oxidation resistance and deformation resistance than that of the quaternary TiAlCrN 
coatings, suggesting that the Si incorporated TiCrAlN coatings can prolong the life time of 
cutting tools [8, 9]. In addition, the increasing hardness in nanolayered TiCrAlSiN thin films 
with AlSi arc current, indicating that there was a direct relationship between mechanical 
properties and thickness of the AlSiN layer [10]. Good fatigue scratch resistance and 
oxidation resistance was obtained due to the Si addition in the TiAlCrN coatings [11]. 
Within relevant review to TiCrAlSiN coatings has shown, however, there were few

where P is the applied indentation load and δ is an indenter geometry constant, equal to

modulus and hardness derived from nanoindentation tests. And c is the average of the radial 
crack lengths occurring on the thin films, which was evaluated using a FE-SEM. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Compositions and microstructure characterizations of TiAlCrSiN coatings 
The chemical composition of each coating is listed in Table 1. The distribution profiles 
are shown in Fig. 2 presents the chemical compositions of TiCrAlSiN coatings with various 
working distance. It is obvious that the Si and Cr contents increase monotonically from 
specimen A1 to A6, while the Ti and Al contents decrease instead. The gradient trend reflects 
the increasing contents of Cr and Si and decreasing contents of Ti and Al due to the difference 
of substrate position between the TiAl and CrSi targets. The contents of nitrogen as reactive 
gas reach saturation concentration suggesting that Ti, Cr, Al, and Si have been fully nitridized 
in all coatings. The ratio of Si/(Ti+Al+Cr+Si) as also listed in Table1 shows an increasing 
tendency when the sample position is closer to CrSi target. The nitrogen concentration 
slightly increases with increasing Si content in the film due to the higher reactivity of Si with 
N. The similar results have been reported in literature [3]. The ration of N/(Ti+Al+Cr+Si) of 
each specimen is also tabulated in Table 1. A maximum ratio of 1.07 is observed for the 
coating containing 4.6 at.% Si. In general, the N/(Ti+Al+Cr+Si) ratio increases with 
increasing Si content. This behavior is mainly attributed to the nitridation of Si atoms. 
The X-ray diffraction pattern of TiCrAlSiN coatings reveals NaCl-type structure with 
(111), (200), (220), and (311) peaks as shown in Fig. 3. A texture of (200) is observed for each 
coating. The identified XRD pattern indicates that all TiCrAlSiN coatings own cubic structure 
and no any hexagonal TiCrAlSiN signal is found. According to Fig. 3, the average grain size 
calculated based on the Scherrer formula using the integral width of the Bragg reflection [13] 
versus Cr and Cr contents of each coating is shown in Fig. 4(a). It is obvious that the grain 
size decreases from around 7.4 nm to 6.1 nm with increasing Si content from 2.0 to 4.6 at.%. 
In addition, with increasing Cr and Si contents, all characteristic peaks of cubic TiCrAlN shift 
toward CrN phase, and the broad peaks indicate that the Si incorporation switched the grain 
size to fine structure due to the nanocomposite forming. In addition, from the results of 
crystallographic analysis, there no any crystalline silicon nitride signal is manifested 
indicating that the silicon nitride phase may form an amorphous feature. 
The lattice parameter calculated from (200) reflection of each coating as a function of the 
Cr contents is schematized in Fig. 4(b). The lattice parameter values of TiN(200) and 
CrN(200) of TiAlN and CrSiN thin films were also plotted as a reference. As the result, the 
lattice parameter is significantly associated with the Cr doped. The more likely explanation 
rests in the amount of mixed TiAlN and CrSiN phase. As the Cr contents add, the increasing 
amount of CrSiN phase leads to a clear reducing lattice parameter of TiCrAiSiN coatings. As 
compared with little Si incorporation, the phenomenon of decreasing lattice parameter with Si 
contents may partially attribute to the displacement of lattice substitution sites of coatings due 
 46
modulus and H/E are also shown in Fig. 9. It is obvious that the lowest toughness, 0.8 
MPa m  is found for the hardest A1 coating. The toughness of coating increases with 
increasing Cr and Si contents and reach to the maximum value of 1.7 MPa m  for A5 
coating. Meanwhile, the H/E ratio also shows the similar tendency. It is believed that the 
toughness enhancement by the addition of nitrogen in the TiAlCrSiN film is observed.  
It is reported that tribological performance of a coating is strongly affected by complex 
interactions of various parameters, such as self-lubricating element, environmental and 
loading conditions [15]. The nanoscratch and nanowear tests were further conducted to 
evaluate the tribological properties of coating on nanoscale in this study. Figure 10 depicts the 
coefficient of friction (COF) against conical diamond tip obtained from the nanoscratch tests 
of each coating. The average COF calculated based on three scratches are also indicated. 
Almost the same COF is obtained.  
The 2D and 3D AFM surface morphologies of wear tracks after reciprocating nanowear 
tests on A1 and A6 thin films are shown in Figs. 11 (a) and (b), respectively. Not any pile-up, 
chipping or wear debris is observed along the nanowear track of each coating. Obviously, 
TiAlCrSiN thin films are very hard and yet not too brittle to form any crack or delamination 
on the surfaces after nanowear tests. The average of the entire cross sectional profiles of wear 
scar perpendicular to the reference line in the AFM images is calculated to ensure the 
accuracy of residual wear depths measurements. 
The relationships among the residual wear depth, COF and Cr contents are shown in Fig. 
12. It is obvious that the Cr and Si contents have some influence on the wear resistance of 
coating. The residual wear depth values are about 11 and 7 nm for A1 and A6 coatings. It 
seems that the hardness shows no direct influence on the residual wear depth. Nevertheless, 
the Cr and Si addition into nanocomposite TiCrAlSiN coatings have beneficial effect on wear 
resistance. 
4. Conclusions: 
In this study, the serial nanocomposite TiAlCrSiN coatings had been successfully 
fabricated with different working distance between the substrates and targets by pulse direct 
current magnetron-sputtering. As the XRD patterns, the broad peaks indicated that the Si 
incorporation switched the grain to fine structure due to the nanocomposite forming. In 
addition, all diffraction peaks of cubic TiCrAlN shifted toward CrN phase by increasing Cr 
contents. With addition of Cr and Si, the surface roughness decreased slowly within the Si 
contents of 1.9 to 3.7 at. %, and reduced significantly beyond the Si contents of 4 at. %. The 
hardness and elastic modules slightly decreased in nano-mechanical tests, and the fracture 
toughness and H/E value had been strongly enhanced following Cr- and Si-doped. As the 
results of friction coefficient and wear depth, furthermore, the nanocomposite TiCrAlSiN 
coatings with higher Cr and Si contents imply better tribological properties. The wear 
resistance was significantly positively related to the fracture toughness in this study, 
suggesting that the toughness may appropriately describe the crack resistant ability in 
TiCrAlSiN films. In conclusion, this finding presents an effective way to develop high cutting 
performance in nanocomposite TiCrAlSiN coatings by adjustment in Cr and Si contents.

Abstract 
Five nanostructured CrN/ZrN multilayer coatings were deposited periodically by the 
cathode arc deposition system. The bilayer periods of CrN/ZrN multilayer coating were 
controlled ranging from 5 to 30 nm. The crystalline structure of multilayer coatings was 
determined by a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer. Microstructures of thin films were 
examined by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), respectively. A nanoindenter, scratch tester, HRC-DB adhesion, microhardness and 
pin-on-disk wear tests were used to evaluate the hardness, adhesion, toughness and 
tribological properties of thin films, respectively. Electrochemical tests in 3.5 wt.% NaCl 
aqueous solution were performed to evaluate the corrosion resistance of multilayered coatings. 
It was found that the hardness, tribological and corrosion resistance were strongly influenced 
by the bilayer period of the CrN/ZrN multilayer coatings. An optimal hardness, tribological 
behavioral and adequate corrosion resistance was found on the coating with a critical bilayer 
period of 16 nm.

1. Introduction 
The surface engineering technology based on the plasma-assisted physical vapor 
deposition (PVD) has been developed for few decades [1]. such as, DC magnetron sputtering 
method, pulsed DC sputtering technology [2], cathodic arc evaporation [3] and etc. The 
cathodic arc evaporation (CAE) process is one of the most important developments in the 
PVD technology, which has been applied for tribological and cutting tools applications 
successfully due to its excellent mechanical properties of coatings and high throughput. 
Research work on TiN/CrN[4], TiN/ZrN[5] multilayered coatings have revealed that excellent 
mechanical properties were achieved owing to the combination of suitable nanoscale 
multilayered features. In addition, the hardness was enhanced as the bilayer period, Λ, 
increased to a certain level. After reaching optimal hardness, the coating showed loss of 
hardness as the bilayer period increased [6]. However, only limited reports on the 
multilayered CrN/ZrN coatings deposited by DC [7-10] or RF [11] magnetron sputtering 
system have been studied. Nor any research work on the CrN/ZrN coatings by CAE process 
has been revealed. In addition, the dependence of bilayer periods on the mechanical properties 
and toughness of CAE fabricated CrN/ZrN coatings has not yet been studied. In this study,

of the wear track, r is the radius of the wear track, Fn is the normal load and S is the sliding 
distance. 
Electrochemical tests in 3.5 wt.% sodium chloride aqueous solution were conducted with 
a Potentiostat (VersaSATA4, Princeton applied research, USA) to evaluate the corrosion 
behavior of coatings. A standard measuring cell with three electrodes was used. The auxiliary 
and reference electrodes were platinum and saturated calomel (SCE), respectively. The Tafel 
measurements in the range of −250 to 250 mV versus open circuit potential at the scanning 
rate of 1 mV/s were performed. The corrosion current density, Icorr, and corrosion potential, 
Ecorr, were determined using the Tafel analysis method. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Composition and phase characterizations of CrN/ZrN multilayers 
According to the FE-EPMA analysis, it was observed the similar chemical compositions 
were obtained for each coating as listed in table 1. The mean value of the chemical 
composition of the CrN/ZrN multilayered thin films were 32.9% Cr-25.2% Zr-41.9% N (at. 
%). The glancing angle XRD patterns of monolayer CrN, ZrN and CrN/ZrN multilayer 
coatings deposited under different bilayer periods are shown in Fig. 1. The (111), (200), 
(220)and (311) reflections of the single layer CrN coating were observed. No β-Cr2N phase is 
found due to a high N2/Ar ratio of 7 during deposition produce. On the other hand, the (111), 
(200), (220) and (311) reflections of the monolayer ZrN also can be observed. In addition, the 
XRD peaks of Si substrate were also observed due to a high incidence angle, 2°, of X-ray 
used to penetrate the CrN/ZrN multilayered coating. 
For the CrN/ZrN multilayer coatings, some of the ZrN and CrN characteristic reflections 
can be observed on each coating. However, as compared with monolayer, different XRD 
reflection intensities are observed for multilayered coatings. The diffraction peak of CrN (200) 
vanishes whereas a preferred orientation along CrN (111) plane is formed in the multilayered 
thin films. A similar resulted was also explored in the CrN/ZrN multilayer coatings by Zhang 
et.al [10]. It is suggested that this (111) texture was associated with the internal stress 
relieving of thin film [4, 10] 
When the bilayer period decreases, positions of CrN diffraction peaks shift to the lower 
diffraction angle, whereas the positions of ZrN diffraction peaks shift toward higher 
diffraction angle. On the other hand, the peak intensities of samples A4 and A5 decrease as 
the bilayer period decreases down to 6 and 5 nm, indicating that the nanostructure was 
produced.  
3.2. Microstructure characterizations of CrN/ZrN multilayers 
The surface morphologies were evaluated for coatings by AFM. Figure 2(a) and (b) 
illustrate the surface morphologies of ZrN and A3 Coatings, respectively. A typical fine 
granular structure was observed on the surface of ZrN coating. On the other hand, many 
macroparticles with smaller pin holes can be found on the surface of A3 coating. It is 
suggested that the arc discharge on the target surface would produce metallic macroparticles 
and then splattered to the coating surface during deposition process [3]. The spalling of 
macroparticles thus produced the so-called pin holes on the thin film surface. The average 
surface roughness, Ra, is listed in Table 1. In general, the surface roughness increases with 
increasing bilayer period, which is attributed to the larger grain size and higher degree of 
crystallization of multilayer thin films at higher bilayer periods. 
Figure 3(a), (b), and (c) illustrate the cross-sectional back scattered electron images (BEI) 
 58
observed. It is well known that the hardness increasing to a given point and then decreasing as 
bilayer periods increase is a typical phenomenon observed in multilayered coatings [14]. In 
the multilayer system, the hardness enhancement mechanism can be explained by the Koehler 
theory [15] or by the alternating-stress strengthening theory [16], which is based on the 
blocking of dislocations at interfaces.  
In this work, the maximum hardness enhancement of the CrN/ZrN coatings compared 
with the lower hardness of single layer CrN (H=20.3 GPa) may be calculated according to 
Koehler theory [15] in Eq. (3):

where R=(GB−GA)/(GB+GA), GA and GB are shear moduli of two layers, respectively, and GB 
> GA, The Taylor factor, m, is 0.3 for transition metal nitride, such as CrN and ZrN , whereas 
θ is the smallest angle between the interface and the glide plane of the low modulus layer. 
And G=E/2(1+ν) (E is the elastic modulus and ν is the Poisson's ratio). Using the data 
obtained from the single layer films, ECrN=228 GPa and EZrN=267 GPa, in this work, the 
Poisson's ratios are 0.2 for both CrN and ZrN, and θ is 45o for multilayer coating, the shear 
modulus values of CrN and ZrN can be calculated to 95 GPa and 111 GPa, respectively. The 
hardness enhancement of 1.87 GPa compared with CrN can be achieved based on Eq. (3), 
which is a little bit lower than the measured value of 25.2 GPa (A3 coating). It is suggested 
that the alternating-stress strengthening mechanism [16] has possibly strong influence on the 
hardness enhancement of CrN/ZrN coatings in this work. 
The fracture toughness, KIC, of the CrN/ZrN multilayered coatings versus the bilayer 
periods is shown in Fig. 6(a). The surface morphology of radial cracks on A3 coatings are 
shown in Fig. 6(b).  
The fracture toughness values of the monolayer CrN and ZrN coatings are around 1.75 
MPa m  and 1.54 MPa m , respectively. In comparison, the fracture toughness of 
multilayered coating almost keeps the same level as bilayer period increases, which is 
between the values of CrN and ZrN coating. However, the minimum KIC, 1.53 MPa m , can 
be found for the A4 coating. A similar tendency is observed as compared with the mechanical 
properties of multilayered coatings as shown in Fig. 5. The fracture toughness values of 
multilayered coatings are keep around 1.68 MPa m  when the bilayer period decreases from 
30 nm to 20 nm and then decreases drastically when the bilayer period is 6 nm. Finally, the 
KIC value increases when the bilayer period reaches to 5nm. The maximum fracture toughness 
is obtained for the A3 coating (Λ=16 nm) with the high hardness and plastic deformation for 
the multilayer thin films. It is well known that a multilayered coating can act as a crack 
inhibitor to achieve high hardness, adequate fracture resistance and high toughness values 
simultaneously [17–20]. In multilayered coatings, the cracks propagation toward the substrate 
can be retarded by the interfaces, whereas the cracks propagating straight downward to the 
substrate is always found in single layer coatings. Owing to the deflection of cracking at every 
layer interface, reduced stress intensities at the crack tip are thus observed. Consequently, 
more energy is required for the cracking to propagate again at the interface and this leads to a 
tougher coating [19]. Compared with the mechanical property results in Figs. 5 and 6, it is 
confirmed that the bilayer period of the CrN/ZrN multilayered coatings should be prepared in 
a moderate range to achieve high levels of toughness and an sufficient hardness, such as the 
A3 coating with Λ=16 nm.

resistance and the lower fracture toughness values shown in Figs. 5 and 6(a). 
In contrast, the wear scar morphologies of A1 coating are shown in Fig 10.(c). A smooth 
wear track was found on the A1 coating. Not any cracking or delamination was observed 
adjacent to the wear track. Similar result is also found on the A2 and A5 coatings. Smooth 
wear scar and a few delamination of coating were observed on the A5 coating. On the other 
hand, severe spallation of thin film in the wear track is found on A4 multilayered coating. It is 
reported [24, 25] that the multilayer structure designs, including the type of films, the number 
and thickness of interlayers can be adjusted to improve the mechanical properties and 
toughness of thin films. In this work, the layer by layer wear mechanism is also valid in the 
CrN/ZrN multilayered coating system [10]. The surface CrN layer begins to wear until fatigue 
cracks occur, which can propagate and reach the CrN/ZrN interface. Therefore, this CrN layer 
is delaminated and the underlying ZrN layer is exposed to against the wear loading. 
Furthermore, after a ZrN layer was worn out, a fresh CrN surface starts to wear and the 
process repeats again.  
3.3. Corrosion properties of CrN/ZrN multilayered thin films  
A family of Tafel curves of the single CrN, ZrN and CrN/ZrN multilayered coatings in 
3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 11 (a). The corrosion potential, Ecorr and 
corrosion current density, Icorr of coatings versus the bilayer period is represented in Fig. 
11(b). In this study, the CrN coating exhibits the higher corrosion potential and lower 
corrosion current density. The corrosion resistance of CrN coating is also better than that of 
the multilayered coatings and ZrN monolayer, In general, the corrosion current density of 
CrN/ZrN multilayered coating decreases with decreasing bilayer periods. For the multilayered 
coating, the highest corrosion potential, -147 mV and the lowest corrosion current density, 
5.49 × 10-9 A/cm2 are achieved when the bilayer period reaches to 5 nm. It is obvious that the 
number of interface between CrN and ZrN layers increases with decreasing bilayer period. 
The relatively high corrosion potential value for coatings with smaller bilayer period indicates 
that more time is required for the NaCl electrolyte to penetrate through numerous interfaces to 
reach the substrate [26]. However, an abrupt deviation of the tendency is found on the A4 
coating (Λ=6 nm). It is argued that thin film defects, such as macroparticles and pin holes 
produced during CAE process are possibly responsible for this corrosion resistance 
degradation.  
4. Conclusion 
Five CrN/ZrN multilayered thin films with different bilayer periods ranging from 5 to 30 
nm were prepared by a cathodic arc evaporation process in this study. The preferred 
orientation of CrN (111) is found for the multilayered coating. It was observed that the 
maximum hardness, elastic modules and plastic deformation resistance values reached 25.2 
GPa, 282 GPa and 0.3 GPa respectively, for the A3 coating with 16 nm bilayer period. The 
good fracture toughness of 1.68 MPa m  was also obtained for this coating. The lowest COF 
of 0.17±0.05 was achieved for the coating with 30 nm bilayer period in this work. It is found 
that the wear resistance was enhanced by increasing bilayer period thickness. The best 
anticorrosion property was achieved for A5 coatings. Due to its numerous interfaces between 
CrN and ZrN layers to stand the penetration of corrosive electrolyte effetely. For CrN/ZrN 
multilayered coating at 15 nm bilayer period, a combination of excellent mechanical 
properties, plastic deformation resistance, tribological and adequate anticorrosion 
performance have been achieved in this work.
