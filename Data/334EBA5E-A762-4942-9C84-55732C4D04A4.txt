Kinetics study of albumin and fibrinogen adsorption on 
Layer-by-Layer Assembled Polyelectrolyte Films of Chitosan and 
Polyanion 
ABSTRACT 
The layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly deposition technique as a suitable method for 
depositing biocompatible polymers on a poor substrate is utilized to establish an 
appropriate cell cultural surface construction is presented in this study. The results of 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier 
Transform Infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and contact angle tests revealed that the 
different polyanion/chitosan (polyanion/CS) multilayer films can be successfully 
deposited on the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified glass slides by 
alternately dripping polyanion of poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) or poly(aspartic acid) 
(PAsp) and chitosan solutions on the silanized glass slides. The measurement of the 
adsorption of albumin and fibrinogen was conducted on the LBL films. In order to 
investigate the mechanism of protein adsorption, the pseudo-first- and second-order 
kinetic equations, and intraparticle diffusion model was used to test the experimental 
data. In additional, the cell culture of 3T3 fibroblast on the LBL films was also 
evaluated. It is found that the protein adsorption on LBL films can be described well 
with pseudo second order kinetic. The dominating factor about the performance of 
protein adsorption and cell on the LBL films is the chemical structure difference 
between PGA and PAsp.

measurement of the adsorption of fibronectin on the membrane. In addition, the 
cytotoxicity of the membrane and cell culture of 3T3 fibroblasts on the membrane was 
also evaluated. According to the study of cell culture, it revealed that the cells not only 
remained viable but also proliferated on the surface of the tri-steps modified SBS 
membranes. As the tri-steps modified SBS membrane are sterile semipermeable 
membrane with  transparent allowing wound checks, they can be considered for 
shallow wound with low exudates.

1. Introduction 
Owing to the presence of phase separated structures, styrene–butadiene–styrene 
block copolymer (SBS) possesses very attractive bulk mechanical properties. It 
behaves as vulcanized rubbers at room temperature, and yet can be processed as 
thermoplastics at elevated temperatures. As a result, it has gained considerable 
attention in recent years. Since the SBS does not contain functional group, that limits 
its use. The modification of SBS is necessary to widen its applications. In our previous 
studies [1-8], the modification of SBS had been reported, and the effect of the 
modification of bulk and surface properties on their performances had been studied.

the interactions between alginate and chitosan in the PECs. 
The Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly was established by Decher and coworkers in 
the 1990s [39-42]. The fundamental procedure for LbL assembly is an alternating 
adsorption process. A substrate is repeatedly immersed into polyelectrolyte solution, 
and then the polyelectrolyte layer is continuously assembled onto the substrate. The 
driving force of LbL assembly comprises intermolecular forces, including electrostatic 
interaction hydrogen bonding, charge transfer interaction and stereocomplex 
formation. LbL assembly is a versatile technique that allows surface modification. 
Numerous charged polyelectrolytes have been used to build the LbL films [43-45] to 
provide functional coatings for implanted medical devices. Processing methods for 
LbL assembly have also been developed. Spraying assembly [46, 47], spin-coating 
[48-50] and patterning on the substrate [51-53] have already been reported. In the 
study of Akashhi [54] group, they had successfully demonstrated that the 
polyelectrolyte droplet method is a good candidate for the preparation of LbL 
assemblies in the biomedical field.  
Rapid and proper healing is important in the treatment of wounds. In cases of 
severe and large amounts of skin loss, immediate coverage of the wound surface with 
a dressing is needed. In general, one or more of the following functions should be 
performed for wound dressing [1]. The dressing material must be capable of absorbing 
the exuded liquid from the wounded area. It can permit water evaporation at a certain 
rate and allow no microbial transport. The material can maintain a moist environment 
at the wound/dressing interface. It can provide thermal insulation and mechanical 
protection for the body. It is non-adherent to the wound and easily removed without 
trauma. It can provide some debridement action to remove dead tissue and/or foreign 
particles.

membrane with epoxidation and followed by ring opening reaction with potassium 
hydrogen maleate (PHM) to prepare the maleate SBS ionomer membrane containing 
COO
－
 group. And then the maleate SBS ionomer membrane was further modified 
with LbL self-assembly deposition technique. The different chitosan/alginate 
multilayer films were deposited on the maleate SBS ionomer membrane surface to get 
the tri-steps modified SBS membrane. The tri-steps modified SBS membrane was 
characterized by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). 
The values of the contact angle, water absorption, and water vapor transmission rate 
on the membranes were determined. To evaluate the biocompatibility of the tri-steps 
modified SBS membrane, the adsorption of fibronectin on the membrane was 
determined, and cytotoxicity of the membrane was evaluated with cell culture of 3T3 
fibroblasts on the membrane. 
 
2. Experimental  
Styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS) was purchased from Shell 
Chem., Co. under the trade name Kraton D-1101. The molecular characteristics of 
Kraton D-1101 are listed in Table 1. Cyclohexane was used as solvent for the 
preparation of SBS membrane. Formic acid (99%) and hydrogen peroxide (35%) were 
reagent grade for the epoxidation of SBS. Maleic anhydride, N,N-dimethylaniline 
(DMA), poly(ethylene glycol) with molecular weight of 600 (PEG 600) were 
chemically pure and KOH was analytical reagent.  Chitosan (360.8 kDa, 97% 
deacetylated) and alginate with a molecular weight ranging from 32-250kDa were 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 
2.1. Preparation of SBS membrane 
10 wt% SBS solution was prepared by dissolving SBS into cyclohexane, and 
  - 10 - 
and MSBSI7, respectively.  
2.4 Fabrication of multilayer films on MSBSI surface 
 Chitosan was dissolved in 0.02M acetic acid solution containing 0.5M NaCl with a 
concentration of 1 mg/ml. Alginate solution of 1 mg/ml was prepared by dissolving it 
in distilled water containing 0.5M NaCl. Herein, chitosan was positively charged as 
polycation; the negatively charged alginate, was used as polyanion. The multilayer 
construction was accomplished by alternately dripping the chitosan and alginate 
solutions on the MSBSI7, which were placed on the spin coater (King Polytechnic 
Engineering Co., Ltd; Taiwan) and then spinning at the first speed of 1500 rpm for 30 
sec, and subsequently at the second speed of 3500 rpm for 15 sec. Between each 
deposition step, the membrane was rinsed with pure water and blown dry with a 
stream of nitrogen. This cycle was repeated until the desired number of CS/alginate 
layers was reached. To stabilize the film structure after the final assembly cycle, the 
membranes were immersed in a 0.1% 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) 
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; Sigma-Aldrich) solution with 0.1M MES 
(2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) buffer solution (pH 6.0) at 4 
o
C for 30 min to 
fix the CS/alginate structure. The preparation of the LbL membranes was shown in 
Scheme 1. The structure of the LbL membrane was identified with 1 wt% methylene 
blue and azocarmine G. 50 μL of 1 wt% methylene blue or azocarmine G was 
dropped onto the LbL membranes with spin coating for 3 min and then the membranes 
were washed with ultrasonication for 30 min. The change of color on the membranes 
was recorded. 
The measurement of water contact angle, water content and water vapor transmission 
rates (WVTR) on the membranes was evaluated with the same procedures as 
described in our previous study [5].

group exist. In Fig. 1a, it is also found that both the absorption peaks at about 1600 
cm
-1
 and 1700-1740 cm
-1 
for the COO
－
 and C=O group exist, which are the side 
products of the epoxidation [1].  
The FTIR spectra for the MSBSI membranes prepared from Scheme 1 were 
shown from Fig.1b to Fig.1e. Compared to the spectrum of Fig.1a of ESBS, both the 
intensities of the absorption peaks at about 1600 cm
-1 
and 1700-1740 cm
-1
 for the 
COO
－
 and C=O group of MSBSI are larger than those of ESBS. It is confirmed from 
the results of XPS spectra in Fig.2. The peak at about 285-290 eV is for the C1s and 
the peak at about 532-540 eV is for the O1s. The curve fitting of C1s peak of SBS, 
ESBS, and MSBSI were shown in Fig. 3. The peaks at about 285,287,288, and 289.4 
eV indicated –C-H, C-O, C=O, and COO
－ 
bonds on membrane surface, respectively. 
From the structure of SBS, the component of SBS should only contain C and H. But 
about 4 % of oxygen atom was found in SBS (Table 2). It might be the existence of 
the impurity on the SBS. After epoxidation, the oxygen content in ESBS is significant 
increased by comparing with SBS. Due to the ring opening reaction for the formation 
of MSBSI (Scheme 1), it was found that the relative content of oxygen on MSBSI was 
lower than that of ESBS (Table 2).Whereas the oxygen content in the MSBSI 
increased with the reaction time. 
The original membrane of SBS is transparent. After modification with 
epoxidation and ring opening reaction with maleated ionomer, the appearance of the 
modified SBS is still transparent (Fig.4a). Blue color was found in Fig. 4b, when 
methylene blue was dropped onto the MSBSI membranes. After washing with 
ultrasonication treatment for 30 min, the blue color still appeared in MSBSI 
membrane. From the structure of methylene blue in Scheme 2, it acts as a cation in 
  - 14 - 
found from Table 3. (1) With the increasing of the reaction time, the contact angle on 
the membranes decreased. The value of contact angle of water on SBS is about 95
o 
[1]. 
By comparing with the pure SBS, the MSBSI membranes become more hydrophilic 
and the wettability on the membranes is enhanced. It is due to the existence of the 
COOH and －OH groups in the MSBSI membrane. With the increasing of the 
reaction time of ring opening, there are more －COOH and －OH groups in the 
MSBSI membrane. It could be confirmed from the oxygen percentage in Table 2. By 
comparing with the MSBSI1, the oxygen percentage increased from 10.54 to 16.03 for 
MSBSI7. (2) With the increasing of the contact time of water on the MSBSI 
membrane, the contact angle of water on MSBSI membrane decreased. It means that 
the reorientation of the molecular structure on MSBSI membrane occurs, which is due 
to the strong hydration of the －COOH and －OH groups in the MSBSI membrane. 
Based on the structure of the top layer on the [Cs/Alg] membranes, two categories for 
the value of contact angle on the [Cs/Alg] membranes are shown in Table 4. The 
following results are found. (1) With the increasing of the LbL number, the contact 
angle on the membranes decreased. As chitosan and alginate are polysaccharide 
biopolymers. In addition to the －OH group, there are lots of －COOH and －NH2 
groups in alginate and chitosan, respectively. With the increasing of the LbL number 
on the membrane, the percentage of －COOH and －NH2 groups in the [Cs/Alg] 
membrane increases. The hydration on the membrane becomes easily and results in 
the decreasing of contact angle of water on the membrane. (2) The value of the contact 
angle of water on the top layer of chitosan is significantly higher than that on the top 
layer of alginate, illustrating that alginate is more hydrophilic than chitosan. The 
results can be explained as follows. The solubility of alginate is related to the pH of 
  - 16 - 
SBS increased It resulted from the existence of the －COOH and －OH groups on 
the MSBSI membrane. As proteins contain amino acid functional group, the 
interaction between the amino acid group and the oxygen atom of the MSBSI by 
dipole moment or hydrogen bonding will occur when proteins adsorb onto the MSBSI 
membranes. With the further modification by LBL process, the protein adsorption on 
the [Cs/Alg] increased. It seems that the amount of fibronectin adsorption on the 
surface of [Cs/Alg] is at about 2.7 μg/cm2. There is no significant effect of the LbL 
number on the adsorption of fibronectin (Table 5). 
3.3.Biocompatibility of modified SBS membrane 
In order to know whether the modified SSBS membranes contain substances 
harmful to cells, the 3T3 cells were cultured in the presence of the extractables from 
various modified SBS membranes. Compared to the positive control (TCPS), the 
appearances of cell adhesion in Fig8b, 8c, and 8d are the same as in that of Fig. 8a. 
During the three days observation, the cells grow well in Fig 8a to 8d. But the cell 
cannot spread and grow on the well due to the existence of DMSO in the culture 
medium (Fig. 8e). It was also confirmed from the morphology of the 3T3 fibroblast 
cultured on the various modified SBS membrane. As shown in Fig. 9, all of the 
morphology of 3T3 fibroblast cultured on various modified SSBS membrane (Fig 9b, 
9c and 9d) still retains its phenotype as that on control (Fig. 9a).  
The corresponding growth profile of 3T3 on the LBL specimens at different time 
was determined and shown in Table 6. As shown in Fig. 10, the results revealed that 
the cells not only remained viable but also proliferated on the surface of the LBL 
membranes, as indicated by the positive slopes of the cell growth curves. The results 
of the regression are listed in Table 7. It seems that the growth rate on both 
[Cs/Alg]3x2 and [Cs/Alg]5x4 membranes are higher than those on both [Cs/Alg]3x3 and
