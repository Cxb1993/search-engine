resolution, sensitivity and quantitative accuracy for small-animal imaging have been observed
during last decade [1--8]. The importance of these instruments will greatly increase even for the
future nano-technology in medical imaging [9]. As there have been considerable development
in human and small animal PET systems, the majority of PET systems is designed to meet with
certain general clinical goals (like resolution and sensitivity). However, a design of PET sys-
tem which can achieve certain level of flexibility (like accommodation of objects with different
sizes) while maintaining adequate spatial resolution and reasonable costs remains unaddressed.
For commercial PET scanners available for routine molecular/functional imaging for small
animal, these scanners usually have been optimized to the best spatial resolution and system
sensitivity based on their own individual hardware designs [2, 3, 5]. However, these scanners
usually are dedicatedmachines which have fixed and limited field-of-view (FOV) based on their
designs. That is, there exist a fundamental limitation on the animal size. For larger animals (like
primate, rabbits), one can either use these dedicated scanners to image a portion of the animal, or
use human scanners which usually are too large and have lower spatial resolution and sensitivity.
In addition to the demand for more flexible imaging settings, the cost-effectiveness is also
another motivation for the development of dual-penal animal PET. The system uses two large
FOV detector heads which can image multiple small animals at one single scan, unlike the
dedicated ones can only scan one animal at a time. It is possible to improve the throughput
of the animal scans which is another attractive feature for drug screening studies. Since these
detector heads can be mass-manufactured for both clinical and animal scanners, the cost for
such dual-penal system can will be more economic than those dedicated ones.
2 Methods
During the first year, the emphasis of the work focused on the computational issues of system
model of the dual-panel scanner. First, we would like to briefly review hardware characteris-
tics of the dual-penal animal PET scanner [10, 11] first. This system was intended to offer a
high throughput for small animal scans [10]. Recent studies also demonstrated the potential
of this system to serve as a high sensitivity animal PET scanner with similar spatial resolution
compared to dedicated scanners [11, 12].
Figure 1: Detector is made of dual-layer (LSO/LYSO) crystal. Each detector panel consists of
9× 13 blocks, and each block containing 8× 8 crystals of size 2.1× 2.1× 10 mm3 each.
The panel detector, shown in Fig. 1, head is designed to cover a detection sensitive area of
25×17 cm2 [13, 14]. It consists of a 9×13 array of crystal blocks, coupled to a 10×14 array of
photomultiplier (PM) tubes in a quadrant-sharing configuration. Every crystal block contains
8×8 double-layered LSO/LYSO detection elements, each of which is 2.1×2.1×20mm3 in size

Figure 3: Forward projection time of different image sizes.
Both projection results from CPU and GPU are consistent. This validation is vital for this
study since GPU uses single precision floating point (the more recent models have double pre-
cision floating point). The core number and RAM in GPU has great impact on the thread con-
struction. In this study, the GPU has 240 streaming units (like core). If we use the possible
LORs of each detector as a projection, this will require more jobs between CPU and GPU. A
more recent model of GPU can greatly improve the computation speed.
3.2 Iterative Image Reconstruction
We also tested the projection codes on a dual-panel data using MLEM with 30 iteration. The
image sizes are 100× 100× 100 with voxel sizes 0.5mm3. The geometric model is solid angle.
Some reconstructed image results are shown in in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. These results demonstrated
the intrinsic difficulty of dual-panel (or an non-circular geometry) PET. Such image degradation
ismainly due to themissing LORs and inevitably increase the under-parameterization (difficulty
in convergence to stable optimal solutions) in iterative image reconstruction. There are more
and more miss LORs as the projection angle rotates from the angle parallel to the panel to the
one perpendicular to the panel. We will conduct the reconstruction to cope with the missing
angle issue during the second year period.
4 Conclusion
We have successfully constructed a primitive imaging system for a dual-panel PET. The image
reconstruction can be executed on either CPU-based OpenMP or GPU-base CUDA environ-
ments. During the funding period, the PI is very grateful for the support from the National
Science Council. We have accomplished the following research publications, including 4 inter-
national journal papers (with total impact factors 7.758) [15--18], and 7 international conference
proceedings [19--25].

cyclotron. In the meantime, secondary radiation particles are generated by 
de-excitations of nuclides and other nuclear reactions during the operation of 
cyclotron, therefore, a mix radiation field is formed (Mendez et al., 2005). The 
workers need to enter the cyclotron room to make adjustment during the operation, if 
the cyclotron worked unsteadily due to the auxiliary system (cooling water system or 
the vacuum system or the radio-frequency system) losing efficacy. In these cases, the 
workers were exposed to the mix radiation (neutrons and γ-rays) in the cyclotron room 
(Kuo et al., 2010). 
The intensity of mix radiation field depends on operation parameters and radiation 
interactions with the structures of cyclotron. Different operation parameters such as 
beam current and target volume affect the production yields of 18F-FDG compound 
and also the doses and the spectra of induced neutrons in the cyclotron room. Several 
literatures were found to focus on estimating neutron spectra of different PET 
cyclotrons (such as IBA or Sumitomo cyclotron) and different source (such as protons 
or deuterons) as the cyclotron was operated, but less discussed neutron spectra under 
the different parameters of operation in the medical cyclotron center (Mendez et al., 
2005 and Vega-Carrillo, 2001).Thereby, this study evaluated the thermal neutron 
doses at specific locations inside and outside the self-shielding of the SK Cyclotron, 
by means of the dual-thermoluminescent dosimeter, dual-TLD (TLD-600/700) chips 
and gold (197Au) foils with bare and 113Cd covered, in the cases of using targets with 
different volumes (2.4 cm3 for target 1 and 1.5 cm3 for target 2). Besides, a 6LiI (Eu) 
detector with Bonner spheres in different diameters (0” to 12”) was used and placed at 
the specific locations in the cyclotron room to estimate the neutron spectra. The 
relationship between neutron doses and spectra was analyzed and discussed in present 
work. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
 
The SK Cyclotron (GE MINItrace) is a self-shielding cyclotron which was installed 
inside the vault (consists of concretes, leads and PE plates). It triggered for the 9.6 
MeV proton bombardment of 18O-water liquid target. The SK Cyclotron has been 
performing over 500 operations per year in average and 80 min per operation since 
2002. Therefore, information regarding the radiation dose of mix radiation fields in 
the cyclotron room is important for the workers when the cyclotron operates. In this 
study, the impact on operation parameters of beam current (30~35 μA) and target 
volume (geometry of targets are shown in figure 1) were investigated to evaluate 
fluctuations of neutron doses during the operation of cyclotron. In the routine 
conditions, the beam current was set as 30~35μA for target 1 and 30μA for target 2 
(LUDLUM Model 42-5) used in this study is a set of high density polyethylene 
spheres of different diameters: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 inches. The 6LiI (Eu) with BSS 
system was placed at location of 20 cm away from self-shielding to measure the 
neutron spectra of different targets of the cyclotron. The 6LiI (Eu) thermal neutron 
detector is a scintillator in the size of 4 mm diameter × 4 mm length. The gamma 
response of 6LiI(Eu) detector can be ignored, because the 6LiI(Eu) crystal is highly 
sensitive to thermal neutrons and its volume is so small. Each BSS sphere with the 
6LiI detector has a unique response to mono-energetic neutrons. The set of individual 
responses, known as Bonner Sphere response matrix (Mares et al., 1994), were 
calculated by Monte Carlo simulation in this study. The UMG 3.3 unfolding code 
was used to unfold the neutron spectra from the measured data. For validation of the 
spectrum method, the 6LiI(Eu) with BSS system was irradiated by a standard 252Cf 
source in the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research in Taiwan.  
 
2.3 MCNP calculation 
A General Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP), Version 5 was used to 
simulate and calculate the transport of neutrons at location P and targets. The target 
sizes were shown in figure 1. The target containers were mainly composed of silver 
(107Ag) metals (with density of 10.5 g cm-3). Area A was filled with helium (He) gas 
(with density of 0.1785 g cm-3). The targets were in area B and were filled fully of 
18O- water (with density of 1 g cm-3) with 2.4 cm3 and 1.5 cm3 volumes for target 1 
and target 2, respectively. The maximum energy of 9.6 MeV protons in SK cyclotron 
has maximum penetration depth of 0.112 cm in the water (ICRP Publication 49, 1994). 
Therefore, neutron source depth was set to 0.112 cm in which 18O (p, n) 18F reactions 
occurred. Besides, one 18O (p, n) 18F reaction induced on neutron is assumed in the 
neutron transport simulation, and the neutron source spectrum was assumed as a 
uniformed distribution spectrum (energy range from 2.5E-02 to 1.0E+07 eV). Due to 
some sizes of BSS were larger than the space (30*10*10 cm3) inside the 
self-shielding, BSS can’t be used inside the self-shielding. Therefore, the neutron 
spectra at the points located at 20 cm distance from target1 and target 2 were 
estimated by the calculated method. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
The dose distribution of thermal neutrons in the cyclotron room was estimated by 
using dual-TLD method, under the operation conditions of using target 2 (beam 
current of 30μA) (see figure 2). The maximum thermal neutron dose rate of 15.93 
nGy min-1 appeared at location L. Relative result of thermal neutron dose distribution 
for target 1 had been estimated and presented by Kuo et al., 2010. Maximum dose of 
target 1cases were lower than target 2 cases at location P. The amount of thermal 
neutron due to target 1 was relatively higher than that due to target 2 at locations 
inside the self-shielding (location P). After penetrated the self-shielding, the thermal 
neutrons were absorbed by the shielding, while the high energy neutrons were 
slowing down to thermal energies. Therefore, this explains why the amount of thermal 
neutron due to target 1 was lower than that due to target 2 at locations outside the 
self-shielding (location L). 
 
4. Conclusion 
This study addresses the impact of the volume of 18O-water target used in the SK 
cyclotron. From the results of Dual-TLD method and gold foil method, dose 
contributions of thermal neutrons for using target 1 were less than that using target 2 
at locations outside the self-shielding of cyclotron. However, results inside 
self-shielding were reversed. The volumes of targets affected the induced neutron 
spectra and doses. Larger volume of 18O-water target had larger amount of hydrogen 
ions. For this reason, the larger target volume would produce softer neutron spectrum. 
This was confirmed by means of the measurements using 6LiI (Eu) with BSS system 
and calculations using MCNP code of neutron spectra inside and outside the 
self-shielding of cyclotron. In conclusion, the large target volume (target 1) caused the 
higher production yield of 18F-radioisotope (about 8% higher than target 2) and 
induced lower dose and softer spectra of neutrons than small target, under the same 
operation parameters such as beam current (30μA) and proton energy (9.6 MeV) 
which were adopted for validation in this study.

一、參加會議經過 
今年 IEEE MIC研討會是在美國佛羅里達州奧蘭多市舉行。會議地點選在Walt Disney World樂園裡的
Hilton 飯店。由於會議地點是屬於家庭旅遊的地點，每天早上一群科學家和工程師們與要去遊樂園玩
樂的小朋友在大廳相會，非常奇怪的景象。由於全球金融風暴，與 IEEE EMBS和北京 3D等醫學影像
會議接近，今年參與人數也較為減少。由於 Hilton 飯店不是會議場所作主要的服務項目，今年研討會
的展覽需要分開在兩個會議廳展示，比較不方便（特別是需要與學者討論問題或交換意見）。 
 
今年個人所指導的研究團隊共有 4 篇論文發表，均有學者提問，反應不錯。最後應會完成所有的實驗
並進行期刊投稿。

detector heads was designed with 27 pinholes focusing on FOV center to achieve high sensitivity and 
high resolution. The goal of this paper is to evaluate different reconstruction approaches on image 
resolution from sparse or insufficient projection data in the stationary multi-pinhole SPECT system from 
simulated data. These methods include OSEM, OSEM with TV optimization, MAP-TV with smoothing 
prior, and MAP-TV with edge-preserving prior. The results showed the benefit on restoring both the 
effect on finite angular sampling and insufficient sampling coverage from TV optimization, but noisier 
on reconstruction image than the method above. In conclusion, for the stationary multi-SPECT 
reconstruction, OSEM without TV seems to generate compatible image to those with TV optimization. 
Further study on OSEM-TV is needed for the TV optimization parameters as well as the weighting 
between TV and OSEM reconstruction. In addition, MAP reconstruction with edge-preserving and 
smoothing prior without TV optimization should be studied as well.

SPECT with Overlapping Projection,” 2009 IEEE NSS-MIC, Orlando, Florida, USA.  
Abstract: Single pinhole SPECT can provide high-resolution functional imaging of small animals, while 
multipinhole SPECT can further increase photon sampling and hence improve system sensitivity. In 
addition, overlapping projection of a multipinhole system can improve the overall usage of detector area, 
but such a multiplexing detection inevitably leads to image quality deterioration. Since iterative image 
reconstruction permits the incorporation of these factors in the form of system matrix, we propose a 
voxel-based design which explicitly accounts for multipinhole geometry, aperture diameter, and 
projection overlap. For voxel-based system matrix, we can determine no only the entire process of 
photon emission from its source and through a pinhole (including voxel depth and aperture size), but also 
identify the pinhole channel which the photon is passing through. Furthermore, the projection of the 
central pinhole is a circle, while the projections of an off-centered pinhole consist of two half ellipses. 
The detection probabilities of each voxel through every pinhole can be then derived from the areas of 
these composite ellipses. Note the areas also depend on the depth of voxel to pinhole and aperture 
diameter. We plan to investigate a voxel-driven system matrix for multipinhole SPECT with overlapping 
projections. We will also investigate how such a system design can improve the uniformity of spatial 
resolution and sensitivity as well as computation and storage requirements for iterative image 
reconstruction. 
 
二、與會心得 
M01-1 The Long Life of the Anger Scintillation Camera and Attempts to Replace It 
Anger 攝影機中，最重要的組成元件是平行孔徑的準直儀，NaI（Tl）晶體和光電倍增管，也經存
活並被廣泛的使用超過 50 年。這些年來，它也不斷地被改良且價格也降低到無法被取代。Dr. 
Muehllehner 在本屆 IEEE MIC會議的第一場演講，回顧了這項造福人類健康的儀器設備的發展過程，
以及一些仍然存在的缺點。演講中也透露出許多沒有被發表的業界研究結果。雖然是失敗的成果，但
是許多設計概念卻是值得借鏡。特別是現代的電子科技進步，許多傳統 Anger 攝影機的元件已經被新
科技取代。最成功的例子為光電倍增管被半導體元件取代（如 CZT 或 CCD 攝影機）演講生動活潑，
啟發性十足。

若計畫可行，對未來的 PET儀器影響很大。 
 
M3-02 A New Non-Monotonic Algorithm for PET Image Reconstruction 
利用 KL Distance Function 來度量重建影像之正向投影與偵收資料的相似度，亦可進行 PET影像
重建。本演講者提出一個大膽的非單調遞減的演算法來計算最佳影像。這項研究可謂本次研討會最大
的『突破』，否定了過去 20年來學者的研究。在無法證明重建問題為絕對 Convex函數與忽略雜訊的前
提之下，講員可以作出如此大膽的假說，造成全場震驚。多位資深教授亦提出非常尖銳的問題，講員
也無法回應。個人還是覺得該講員的訓練不足（國內的研究生亦有相同的問題）。研究討論首重客觀意
見交流，證據和理論永遠是論證過程的左右護法，忌諱有太多個人主觀的感受。 
 
M12-5 
這是一項非常了不起的研究。芝加哥大學 Dr. Pan所領導的團隊證明了利用總額變異度的觀念可以
大幅降低 CT中 X光管的 KVA值和取樣點，仍可以取得與現有臨床影像相同品質的重建影像。該研究
未來將可大幅減少醫療診斷中所需的輻射劑量。 
 
M14-6 
Dr. Kao利用資訊理論與偵測理論重新檢視醫學影像系統設計，並利用經濟學中之供給與價格曲線
來說明系統設計的最佳化。是本次MIC研討會中少許有學理深度的研究。 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略)：無 
四、建議 
今年另一項較有趣的事件是中國與南韓均有意爭取 2013年研討會的主辦權。兩國均派出『全球』的重
量級學者來為各自國家遊說拉票。反觀國內，在已有的電子與原子科技基礎下，應該可以在高附加價
值的先進醫學影像產業大展鴻圖，而非勞力密集的加工產業。科技競爭（無論是業界或學界）是沒有
人會等待別人的，切莫放棄已有的基業，拱手讓人。 
 
此次MIC研討會已經可以聞到MR與 PET結合的多模組掃描儀將會愈來愈普遍。 
另一個趨勢是半導體偵檢器的開發。從過往的歷史可以證明真空管為主的光電倍增管會很快地被固態
電子為主的半導體偵檢器取代，可以大幅增昇未來生醫影像器材的品質與普及。國內是否也該開始著
重此一附加價值的高科技產業吧!?
