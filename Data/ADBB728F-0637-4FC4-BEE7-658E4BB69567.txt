Abstract 
 
The direct numerical simulation of coupling of a fluid-structure interaction is an 
important problem in computational mechanics. Any numerical analysis aims at 
finding engineering solution for the given conditions of interaction between the fluids 
and the structure. Such engineering problems have to be analyzed using the 
conservation principles of mass, momentum, energy and concentration. Thus the 
situations demand a multi-physic modeling of the fluid-structure interaction problems. 
In order to maintain conservation laws, other than the mass conservation, careful 
accounting of momentum, energy and concentration for the fluid-structure coupled 
system is very crucial to the numerical modeling. Furthermore, the effects of density 
stratification and the earth rotation can be easily incorporated too. As far as solutions 
of numerical methods are concerned, finite difference method, the finite element 
method, finite volume method, the method of fundamental solutions and differential 
quadrature method of both conventional and meshless numerical methods are adopted 
to analyze the fluid-structure interaction problems. The treatments of free surfaces 
and moving structures are proposed by Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE), Volume 
of fluid (VOF) and level set methods. 
The proposed research program will be achieved over a period of three years with a 
definite work allocation for each year. The first and second years of the research 
project will be devoted to the development of 2D numerical models for the 
fluid-structure system involving stationary solid structures with applications in the 
field of coastal engineering and oceanography with stratification and free surface. 
Furthermore, the free surface analysis for solitary waves generated by critical flow 
over a submerged solid structure will be carried out in this year. In the meantime, the 
2D model developed will be applied to simulate flow over structures of various 
geometries such as square and cylinder in homogeneous and satisfied fluids. After 
validating the model, we will accomplish the acceleration and deceleration of 
structures moving in a still fluid, and vibration of structures induced by the vortex 
shedding. In the third year, using the models developed in the first and second years, 
the work will be extended to develop numerical models to simulate the flow field for 
the moving structures as coupled system in 2D and 3D geometries. 
Keywords: fluid-structure interaction, free surface, direct numerical simulation.

1. Introduction 
Numerical solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is the prime 
subject in the field of computational fluid dynamics and many related fields in science 
and engineering. With the advent of high speed computing machines, obtaining 
numerical solutions of three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations have become much 
easier compared to the previous decades. Though the numerical solution algorithms 
are well established for the Navier-Stokes equations, research efforts are still focused 
on the development of new solution schemes such as meshless methods because the 
applications of the Navier-Stokes equations are extended to many interdisciplinary 
fields such as MEMS, bio-medical technology, etc. other than the classical fields of 
hydrodynamics and fluid mechanics. Further the mathematical characteristics of the 
Navier-Stokes equations provide wide options for developing new solution algorithms 
due to very high nonlinear nature.  
The analysis of free surface flows finds wide applications in the design of 
breakwaters and offshore structures. Many analytical methods have been developed to 
solve traveling and standing wave problems associated with incompressible and 
inviscid fluids as well as for the solution of linear and low order non-linear problems. 
Furthermore, the phenomena of solitary wave propagations in shallow water channel 
are the classical problems of flows with free surface. Theoretical studies of solitary 
waves and solitons have attracted many investigators to provide a series of work. 
Numerical techniques have allowed the solution of non-linear inviscid and viscous 
free surface motion. In order to comprehend the complexities of the phenomenon 
including the viscous effects, a more general approach to handle viscous free-surface 
flow is necessary. Lo and Young[1] developed a numerical model to obtain flow 
results for several free surface flow numerical examples including the interaction 
between two opposite solitary waves, seiche phenomenon in a rectangular reservoir, 
and the vortex formation during the passage of a solitary wave over a submerged 
rectangular structure. Most of the study cases are only 2D free surface flow examples. 
However, the present work intends to deal with fully 3D nonlinear free surface flows 
including the inviscid and the viscous effects. 
The numerical treatment of free surface problems involves the tracking of the 
 3
numerical schemes based on the boundary element method treats the time derivative 
term in the diffusion equation wither using the Laplace transform [2-4] or the finite 
difference scheme [5] to advance the solution in the time domain. However, the main 
drawback of the boundary element method is to determine the singular integrals at the 
boundaries, which require a great amount of computational effort especially for the 
case of three-dimensional problems. 
The problem posed by the boundary element method can be alleviated by the use of 
the method of fundamental solutions. The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) 
makes use of the fundamental solutions to get problem by satisfying the governing 
differential equation in the interior of the computational domain under consideration. 
By means of boundary collocation method, the boundary conditions for the problem 
are satisfied. This method is free from the singular integral evaluation problem as 
required by the boundary element method. Golberg [6] and Golberg & Chen [7] used 
the method of fundamental solutions to obtain numerical solution of the Poisson 
equation.  
In this proposal, the time-dependent fundamental solution of the diffusion equation is 
directly used with the method of fundamental solutions without the need for the 
Laplace transform or the finite difference method to take care of the time-derivative 
term. Since any diffusion process is a time evolution process, which stars from a set 
of initial conditions, the transient parts of the diffusion process can be obtained in a 
number of time steps using the MFS. 
2. Governing equations  
The Navier–Stokes equations describing the conservation laws of mass, momentum, 
and energy are respectively expressed in primitive-variable form as Eqs. (1)–(3).

equation, we use a semi-implicit time-advancement scheme which contains the 
second-order Adams-Bashforth and implicit Crank-Nicolson schemes for the 
convective and diffusion terms, respectively. In this study, the operator-splitting 
procedure is summarized in the following four steps.

 (13) 
Here *u  represents the intermediate velocity vector, and f and h  are forcing terms 
that are used to make the u  and T  at 1+n  time level satisfy the desired boundary 
conditions. 
 
3.2 Hybrid Cartesian/immersed-boundary method (HCIB) 
To set the HCIB method to satisfy the boundary conditions, the direct forcing as 
proposed by Mohd-Yusof [8] is added to the governing equations near or inside the 
immersed boundary. The direct forcing is a discrete-time forcing which is obtained in 
the context of the discretized equation. For example, consider an advection-diffusion 
equation, Eq. (13), we can add a direct forcing, h , by replacing the 1+nT  with the 
desired temperature bT  and rearranging the equation as follows.

Obviously, the desired temperature is available after adding the forcing into the 
advection-diffusion equation. Similarly, we also add a direction term to the equation 
 7
h pp p p= +  (19)
Once the particular solution, pp , is obtained from the MPS, we can get the 
modified boundary conditions for the homogeneous solution, hp . According to Eq. 
(19), the MPS and MFS can acquire the desired pressure filed. The following steps 
describe the complete procedures: 
1. Input the initial conditions 0u  and the boundary conditions ub  for velocity. 
2. Solve the unsteady advection-diffusion equations, Eq. (18), by employing the 
ELMFS to find the provisional velocity components *u . 
3. Calculate the particular solutions for Eq. (11) by the MPS. 
4. Solve the pressure Poisson equation, Eq. (11), by using the MFS-MPS scheme to 
find the 1np + . 
5. Find the new velocity 1n+u  by correcting the provisional velocity using Eq. 
(12). 
6. Return to Step 2 if the solution does not approach steady or terminal time. 
Output the solutions if it is already steady or has reached the terminal time. 
From the above procedures, the MFS, ELM and MPS are the essential techniques 
to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. The following sections will depict the detailed 
meshless numerical formulations.  
 
3.2.1 The ELMFS for the advection-diffusion equations 
The MFS can solve the governing equations of the physical problems including 
the convective terms with the coordination of the ELM. In the present ELMFS 
method, the Eq. (18) can be transformed into a diffusion equation in the Lagrangian 
coordinates and can be written as follows.

function. 
The solution of the diffusion equation can be obtained by a linear combination of 
the diffusion fundamental solution, since the diffusion fundamental solution satisfies 
the homogeneous diffusion equation everywhere except the source points. Solutions 
in Eq. (22) thus can be expressed as:

where N  is the number of source nodes. jα  is the unknown coefficients which 
denote the source intensities of the corresponding fundamental solution. Thereafter, 
the velocity of any field nodes in the time-space domain can be solved by using Eq. 
25) accordingly. 
  In our numerical experiments, Fig. 1 (a) illustrates the locations of the field 
and source nodes, and the field and source nodes are located at the same spatial 
positions with the same number but at different time level. In Fig. 1 (a), the parameter 
λ  is an arbitrary factor, which is chosen as a function of the maximum distance of 
the spatial domain. Then by collocating the initial and boundary conditions, the matrix 
equation can be formed by utilizing Eq. (25) and are listed below. 
             [ ]{ } { }gA =α                    (26)
The component of [ ]A  is the representation of the fundamental solutions. { }g  
is the combination of initial and boundary conditions. Once the unknown coefficients 
{ }α  are solved by inverting the above matrix equation, the function values of the 
diffusion equation inside the time-space box at ( )1t n t= + Δ  is acquired by Eq. (25). 
It is worth to mention that we did not need to deal with the inhomogeneous term due 
to the time discretization by using present time-space unification scheme of the

In Fig. 1(b), the line AB is the characteristic path on which the transport of a 
scalar quantity can be traced in 1D problem for a better illustration. If the velocity at 
event A is required, we can trace the spatial location of the event B from Eqs. 
(30)-(32). Once the spatial location of event B is decided, the solution along the 
characteristic AB will follow the diffusion equations. After calculating the diffusion 
process by the MFS, the velocities at event C can be obtained to represent the 
velocities at event A. Event B and C are at the same spatial position but located at

where the particular solution, ( )pp x , satisfies

Then the MPS is adopted to solve the particular solutions governed by the Eq.

radial basis functions (RBFs).

The collocation points are distributed in the interior domain. In this study we will 
solve the advection-diffusion equations and particular solutions with the same nodal 
distributions. The MPS procedures do not need boundary conditions to get the 
particular solutions, we only need to solve the equation with known functions ( )a x . 
After the jβ  have been solved, we can find the particular solution, which is in the

The component of [ ]H  represents of the fundamental solutions, { }l is the 
corresponding boundary conditions. The unknown coefficients { }γ  could be found 
by inversing the matrix [ ]H . 
After acquiring jγ , we can solve the homogeneous solutions through Eq. (42). 
The desired Poisson solutions can be obtained by applying Eq. (35), since particular 
solution ( )pp x  and the homogeneous solution ( )hp x  have been solved. 
Many RBFs have been well described and derived in the literature [10-11]. 
Duchon [10] suggested using the thin plate splines (TPSs) as optimal redial basis 
functions to improve the efficiency and reliability of RBF approximation. Therefore, 
the TPSs [10-11] are chosen to solve the particular solution of the Laplacian operator 
and the corresponding RBFs are shown below.

The present study applies the MFS combining with the MPS to solve the 
pressure-correction equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. As 
previously mentioned, the TPSs have been demonstrated for the efficiency and 
reliability to handle the particular solution for the Laplacian operator.

cavity with a stationary sphere inside, including the geometric parameter and 
boundary conditions. The top wall of cube is assumed to move parallel to the x  axis 
with a constant velocity of unity (dimensionless) and the sphere is located at the 
center of the cube with radius 0.125sr = . No-slip stationary boundary conditions are

with zero initial conditions everywhere in the interior of the domain, and then 
marched in time until a steady state is achieved. Obviously, the flows generated by 
co-rotating, counter-rotating and mixing stationary-rotating cylinders are so different 
that it is necessary to describe these cases separately.

in the isothermal distributions, it is concluded the heat transfer is dominated by the 
diffusion in the lower recirculation section. On the other hand, it is observed that the
