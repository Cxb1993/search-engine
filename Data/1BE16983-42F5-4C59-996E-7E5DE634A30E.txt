2A. Fundamental Concept
Started by a very important concept in analysis of mathe-
matical statistics, the logarithm of the likelihood ratio, defined
by
l(y) = ln
pθ1(y)
pθ0(y)
(1)
and referred to as the log-likelihood ratio, CUSUM algorithm
is developed from the key statistical property of this ratio as
following:
Given that Eθ0 and Eθ1 denote the expectations of the
random observation under the two distributions pθ0 and pθ1 ,
respectively. Then, it can be easily verified
Eθ0(l) < 0 and Eθ1(l) > 0. (2)
Namely, a change in the parameter θ is reflected as a change
in the sign of the mean value of the log-likelihood ratio,
which can be regarded as a kind of detectability of change
in distribution [4].
B. Page’s Procedure
Consider a sequence of independent random variables {yk}
with a probability density pθ(y) depending upon only one
scalar parameter. Before the unknown change time t0, the
parameter θ is equal to θ0, and after the change it is equal
to θ1. A decision strategy to raise an alarm of the presence
of change can be regarded as a stopping time ta, which
is characterized only by the past observations at each time
instant. Let Skj =
∑k
i=j li, with li = ln
pθ1 (yi)
pθ0 (yi)
, be the log-
likelihood ratio for the observations from yj to yk. Intuitively,
the typical behavior of the log-likelihood ratio Sk1 shows a
negative drift before change, and a positive drift after change.
Therefore, the relevant information, as far as the change is
concerned, lies in the difference between the value of the
log-likelihood ratio and its current minimum value; and the
corresponding decision rule is then, at each time instant, to
compare this difference to some threshold said h as follows:
gk = S
k
1 −mk ≥ h, where mk = min
1≤j≤k
S
j
1 (3)
which leads to the following equivalent decision function
gk = max
1≤j≤k
Skj and ta = min{k : gk ≥ h}. (4)
It is easily to verify that the stopping time ta is equal to the
one determined by Page’s procedure, also known as CUSUM
algorithm, which has been proved optimal in the sense that it
minimizes the worst mean delay τ¯∗ = supt0≥1 esssupEθ1(ta−
t0 + 1|ta ≥ t0,F
t0−1
1 ) for a fixed mean time between false
alarm T¯ = Eθ0(ta) [3].
C. Extension Algorithms to Composite Hypotheses Cases
Consider the case where the parameter before change θ0 is
assumed to be known while θ1 is unknown. There are two
possible approaches as described below.
1) Weighted-CUSUM Algorithm: It is an algorithm comes
from the idea of weighting the likelihood ratio with respect to
all possible values of the unknown parameter θ1 by using a
weighting function dF (θ1), where F (θ1) may be interpreted as
the cumulative distribution function of a probability measure.
It was first derived for change detection in [9], and is a direct
extension of the CUSUM stopping time defined as follows.
Let
Λ˜kj =
∫ ∞
−∞
pθ1(yj , · · · , yk)
pθ0(yj , · · · , yk)
dF (θ1) (5)
be the weighted likelihood ratio for the observations from time
j up to time k. Then the stopping time is
ta = min{k : ln Λ˜
k
j ≥ h} (6)
Note that this type of algorithm cannot be written in a recursive
manner as the classic CUSUM algorithm described before.
2) GLRT-based CUSUM Algorithm: In this approach, the
unknown parameter θ1 is replaced by its maximum likelihood
estimate as
Λˆkj =
supθ1 pθ1(yj , · · · , yk)
pθ0(yj , · · · , yk)
(7)
As the weighted-CUSUM algorithm, the GRLT-based ap-
proach still has no recursive expression thus needs to store
all the observations and re-estimate the unknown parameter in
all time slots.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
To detect the presence of WiMAX signals as quick as
possible, one approach is to exploit features of the WiMAX
packet. In our proposed scheme, we make use of the preamble,
which consists of two WiMAX OFDM symbols, is transmitted
at the beginning of the frame. Due to the periodicity of the
preamble structure and the aim that we want to detect the
presence at first hand, we may only consider the simplified
transmitted signal composed of repeated segments as the
replication part in the leading preamble.
In particular, under the concern of flat-fading channel over
one symbol period between cognitive transmitter and WiMAX
basestation, the received signal in time-domain could be mod-
eled as
yk = hΥ(k, t0) + nk (8)
with
Υ(k, t0) =
{
s((k − t0)modNs), as k ≥ t0
θ0 = 0, as k < t0.
(9)
In the above equation, t0 denotes the unknown presence
time instant of WiMAX signal, Ns denotes the length of
the repeated segment of the preamble signal, nk models the
additive white gaussian noise with variance σ2n at time k, and
s(i) is retrieved from the ith element of the periodic fragment
of preamble symbol s = [s(0), s(1), . . . , s(Ns − 1)]T . Note
that h is the fading effect over the start symbol of the new
frame and might be treated as deterministic but unknown
constant or as random variable of a stochastic process.
Thus, Our goal is to determine a decision strategy to fairly
detect the beginning of the WiMAX frame prefixed by the
preamble about which we have some preliminary information

That is, for every time instant k, we calculate the weighted
likelihood ratio from time j = 1, 2, . . . , k to determine the
most possible change point and compare the resultant log-
likelihood ratio to some determined threshold. Once exceed-
ing, we raise an alarm to declare that reoccupying has been
very likely occurred.
Choosing the weighting function ph as CN (0, σ2h) and after
some manipulations, we can get the close form of statistics
ln Λweightedk as

2) GLRT-based CUSUM algorithm: Conceptually, the de-
cision strategy of GLRT-based CUSUM algorithm is given by
ΛGLRTk = max
1≤j≤k
maxh pΘ(k,j)(yj , yj+1, · · · , yk;h)
pθ0(yj)pθ0(yj+1) · · · pθ0(yk)
(24)
and
tGLRTa = min{k : ln Λ
GLRT
k ≥ h}, (25)
where the unknown parameter h is hence replaced by its
maximum likelihood estimate.
By substituting the MLE of h over observations
{yj, yj+1, . . . , yk}, which can be easily verified as
hˆkj =
∑k

V. SIMULATIONS
In this section, we present some numerical results to demon-
strate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. In the
simulations, we consider the long preamble used in IEEE
802.16e, which consists of four replications in time domain, as
the target we want to recognize as quickly as possible. We set
the finite horizon as 50 and the reoccupying time is uniformly
distributed on the time instants 1, 2, . . . , 15 in one trial.
Fig. 1 shows the performance of non-coherent approach
as well as the modified truncated version with window size
W = 5. We can see that the non-coherent method performs
fairly effectively by using a well-chosen threshold and con-
verges to zero mean delay as SNR grows. Furthermore, the
performance curves of window-limited version show that only
five backward data is enough to keep the detectability because
we take the innately dependency among the received sequence
after change into account.
The performances of coherent approaches, weighted
CUSUM algorithm and GLRT-based CUSUM algorithm, are
shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. Similar to non-
coherent approach, also given the statistical information about
underlying fading channel, the weighted CUSUM algorithm
performs well and converges as quickly as non-coherent

此次參加 WCNC2010 主要任務在於擔任 OFDM I Session 議程主席，並藉此機會觀
摩學習。這次 WCNC 共有三個議程名稱以 OFDM 為名，顯見 OFDM 相關研究仍是
全球焦點之一。OFDM 系統的研究除了傳統被廣泛討論的通道估測與同步相關的
研究外，本次 WCNC2010 會議中也見許多在基於中繼站架構下的相關研究，其中
更有一些論文討論在實體層設計導入網路編碼的概念。 
 
在論文研討會(Technical Session)中，議程分成了許多主題分項，個人參加了有關 
MAC Design、Game Theory and Network Coding、MIMO Channel、Modulation and 
Coding、OFDM、Spectrum Sensing等。此外，還參加了一個 coaltional game in wireless 
communications 的介紹課程。 
 
以個人最近較感興趣的賽局理論領域，除了賽局理論較常處理的 Power control 和
頻譜分配的問題，還看到一篇 OFDMA 系統資源分配賽局的論文，此論文考量的
是離散式的策略(discrete strategy)，是更符合現實場合的 problem formulation。 
另外，在這次會議中，在許多不同場合會聽到有關 Femtocell、感知無線電(Cognitive 
Radio)、smart grid 和綠色通訊的議題和相關論文。由此可窺知目前通訊網論社群
中最受到矚目的研究方向。
