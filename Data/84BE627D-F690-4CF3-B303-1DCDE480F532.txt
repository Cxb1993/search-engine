In the speech by Dr. Z Pate, chairman of WANO at the BGM (Biennial General 
Meeting) in Seoul Korea in March 2002, addressed that the event of minor core 
damage could happen again if the conception of electricity and fuel burn up is 
required to rise. This event would not only cause huge management losses, but 
also be exaggerated and misunderstood by media and public as the same type of 
Three Miles Island event, which would severely strike the recovery of nuclear 
industry again. Therefore, preventing minor core damage to assure the fuel 
integrity and defending the first line of defense of nuclear safety is the current 
main theme in nuclear power industries. 
 
Power/flow oscillation from core instability is one of the main reasons that 
may cause a minor core damage event. In 1988, LaSalle unit2 experienced core 
instability incident, and drew world-wide attention. Such kinds of stability issue 
are closely related to operational safety of boiling water nuclear reactors. Many 
important parameters, such as system pressure, core flow rates, coolant inlet 
subcoolings, moderator void fraction, fuel physical and geometrical properties, 
have strong influences on system’s performance. These parameters can further 
categorize and summarize into a coupling feedback mechanism comprised of 
neutronic (void reactivity) and thermal-hydraulic (density wave propagation) 
induced instabilities [1, 2]. In the reload core design, the core wide and single 
channel instability are evaluated and it is assumed that the regional instability will 
not take place under conditions where these two mechanisms are stable. In the 
regional instability, the neutronic feedback is less predominate than in the 
core-wide instability because of the effect of sub-criticality of the core scale 
thermohydraulic feedback is very important [3]. From a practical point of view, 
the sensitivity analysis reveals that the decay ratio (DR) of the above-mentioned 
two instability mechanisms (void reactivity and density wave propagation) can be 
regarded as the indices of two factors investigated for accurate stability 
measurements [4,5]. 
 
In each BWR reload core design, fuel vendors are required to provide 
instability boundaries on power/flow map to assure safety operation of the nuclear 
reactor. In order to establish a capability to carry out independent verification of 
the vendor’s results, Taiwan Power Company (TPC), Institute of Nuclear Energy 
Research (INER), and National Tsing-Hua University (NTHU) are working 
together to develop a suitable methodology and a plant-specific stability analysis 
model for such purposes. In our current research, we have adopted two major 
computer codes, the frequency domain instability analysis code (LAPUR5) and 
coefficients, into formats compatible with LAPUR5X inputs. Two output files 
(LAPUR5X.OUT and LAPUR5W.OUT) are then obtained from LAPUR5. We 
check the consistency of density reactivity coefficient, pressure drop, and flow 
distribution between outputs of LAPUR5 and SIMULATE-3 [11]. If the accuracy 
is not met, new density reactivity coefficient, pressure drop, and flow distribution 
are assumed and new iterations are repeated. If the iteraction converges, the 
calculation will stop.

ATRIUM-10), and some of their fuel and operating initial conditions are shown in

Table 5 and Figure4 are the results for the sensitivity analysis of fuel rod gap 
conductance. A change in the fuel gap conductance will effect that in the 
fuel-to-coolant heat transfer. Small gap conductance (increase in conductance) will 
result in the reactor more unstable. Here, a variation of ?50% in the fuel gap 
conductance resulted in the decay ratio that changed from 0.89 to 0.63. The effect 
of gap conductance is not symmetrical. It affects much more when there is a 
reduction in gap conductance.

Table 8 shows the change in decay ratio if one chooses to replace delayed-neutron 
properties at EOC with those at BOC, other things being equal. The decay ratio reduces 
from 0.85 to 0.74. Compared with other parameters, delayed-neutron properties are 
relatively sensitive.

Table 9 shows the effects of axial power shape. Here we have replaced axial power 
shape at EOC with the BOC bottom peaked distribution. See Figure 5. Higher decay ratio 
for EOC (bottom peaked) indicates that the system is more unstable. In fact, a bottom 
peaked power distribution will initiate boiling inception point closer to the channel inlet 
and generate a lengthier two-phase region behind, which is really the main reason for 
system’s instability.

Table 13 shows the effects of total core flow on decay ratio. In this case study has 
deliberately changed the total core flow with operating power maintained constant. 
Larger flow rates will stabilize the system as one can see from the table.

5. CONCLUSION: 
In this research, we have established all procedures to form the LAPUR 
methodology that yields decay ratios for BWR operational instability assessments. 
Comparisons of our predictions in Kuosheng NPP cycle 17 reload design with 
vendor’s STAIF results show acceptable agreements, within ±0.2 in decay ratios. 
It is found that core conditions at EOC result in larger decay ratios than those at 
BOC. Detail sensitivity analyses concluded that density reactivity coefficient, 
delayed neutron fractions and time constants, core power axial shape, and total 
core flow are the most important parameters that might affect the magnitude of 
decay ratios.
