一、 中文摘要 
 
屋頂花園綠化一方面由於植栽的葉面遮蔭，提供良好的屋頂表面日射熱阻絕效果之
外，另一方面植栽的覆土層厚度減少屋頂構造的熱傳透率，提供良好的隔熱效果。此外，
屋頂綠化由於降低了表面輻射溫度加上植栽的蒸發散作用，亦有助於提升微氣候環境的舒
適性。本計畫針對一棟既有建築之屋頂花園為主要研究對象，探討屋頂綠化對微氣候溫熱
環境之影響，同時評估其日射遮蔽以及隔熱因素所造成的建築節能效益。 
在溫熱環境方面，考量人體之冷熱感覺因素，於不同季節以現場實地量測乾球溫度、
濕球溫度、風速、黑球溫度、日照強度等物理量，藉以換算平均輻射溫度(MRT)與綜合溫
度指標(WBGT)，以進一步探討環境舒適性之議題。 
 
二、 英文摘要  
 
Green roof, on one hand, due to the leaves of vegetation provide good shading to 
the rooftop surface, solar radiation that directly strikes onto the rooftop surface is 
drastically reduced. On the other hand, the soil layer also provides additional thermal 
resistance which cuts down the thermal transfer into interior. Moreover, evaporation and 
transpiration behavior of plants also increase the thermal comfort level. The research 
project studies on an existing office building’s rooftop garden. The research topics can be 
divided into two parts, the thermal impact to the environment and its building energy 
conservation benefits of green roof. 
The first part is the thermal environment evaluation. To take the thermal feelings of 
humans into consideration, dry and wet bulb temperature, wind speed, globe 
temperature, solar radiation intensity are measured and recorded by related instruments 
to further calculate the mean radiant temperature (MRT) and wet bulb globe temperature 
(WBGT) index with which thermal comfort issue of the green roof is able to discuss.

deployed at a height of meters above the roof surface to obtain environmental 
parameters. Calibrated T-type thermocouples placed in the white louver shelters were 
used to measure Ta and Twb and black globe thermometers were used to measure Tg. 
Meanwhile, WV was acquired by omnidirectional hotwire air speed transmitters and the 
global horizontal solar radiation was recorded via pyranometer placed on top of the 
overhead black veil. Tnwb could be obtained via placing cotton-wrapped Pt100 sensor 
within 2/3 water filled vacuum stainless bottles. 
 
The surface material of the rooftop bare slab is grey concrete tile. The roof garden area 
having Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon japonicus), Golden Dewdrop (Duranta repens) and 
Umbrella Grass (Cyperus alterniflius) planted on the 15cm constantly moisturized soil 
located at the north side. The instruments installed and their deployment are as shown in 
Figure 1 and 2. All the measurements were recorded by a 20 channel data logger every 
five minutes, and were continuously recorded for at least one week. Measured values 
were recorded on a day in which the weather on the day and two days beforehand was 
clear and had a low wind velocity. This ensured a stable climate that was valid for 
analysis, and the influences of cloud, strong wind and moisture variation could be 
neglected. 
2.2 Obtaining solar radiation blockage ability of the overhead back veil 
The overhead black veil shading applied in the study is made of PVC with 70% porosity. 
The solar radiation cut-off rate was obtained by performing a solar radiation 
transmittance experiment. This was done by comparing the radiation received by a 
pyranometer placed at the height of 1.5 m above the ground, with and then without the 
overhead shading at clear and shiny midday. The result reveals that the PVC black veil is 
able to reduce 69.65% of the solar radiation and let the other 30.35% part of solar 
radiation transmit through. 
2.3 Indices for describing thermal environment 
There were two indices employed to describe thermal environment. The mean radiant 
temperature (MRT) is a key variable in thermal calculations for the human body. It is the 
uniform temperature of an imaginary enclosure in which radiant heat transfer from the 
human body equals the radiant heat transfer in the actual non-uniform enclosure [1]. The 
simplified calculation of MRT can be easily obtainable using the measured parameters 
described in equation 1. The energy balance of one's body is highly responsive to 
changes in MRT. Consequently, it is more practical for describing a human's thermal 
sensation without considering clothing in comparison with predicted mean vote (PMV), 
predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) indices.

The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index is widely used for estimating the heat
