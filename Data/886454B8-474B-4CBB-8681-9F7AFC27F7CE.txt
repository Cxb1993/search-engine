英文摘要 
In this project, an output feedback dynamic sliding 
mode control for a nonminimum phase linear system 
with the matched disturbance is considered. A dynamic 
sliding surface in which the extra dynamics includes the 
control input and the system output can stabilize the 
closed-loop system. Although the perfect disturbance 
rejection is impossible to obtain in this design, the 
proposed algorithm can effectively search these pa-
rameter matrices in the sliding surface such that the 
effect of the disturbance should be reduced. Applying 
pole assignment to the overall system but not in the 
sliding mode to decide the sliding motion, our control 
law does not need the system state. Finally, a numeric 
example is included for demonstration.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Sliding mode control (SMC) using the discontinuous 
high speed switching action has been successfully used 
in controlling many uncertain systems [4, 15]. For a 
system with the matched disturbance, SMC can obtain 
the perfect disturbance rejection during the sliding mode. 
Most SMC designs assume that the system state is ac-
cessible to the control law. However, in many practical 
systems, only the system output is available. Under this 
situation, one has to utilize the output to design a con-
troller or construct a state observer. Zak and Hui [16] 
developed an output feedback SMC for uncertain dy-
namic systems and used the eigenstructure method to 
design output dependent sliding surface. El-khazali and 
Decarlo [6] proposed the design of the sliding surface 
using the results of established output feedback eigen-
value assignment. Kwan [9] presented a modified dy-
namic output feedback controller to eliminate two major 
limitations of the scheme in Zak’s method. Synthesizing 
output feedback controllers for uncertain systems based 
on the sliding-mode concepts were presented by Ed-
wards and Spurgeon [4, 5]. Ha et al. [7] combined the 
functional observer method into the output feedback 
SMC. However, all the aforementioned works require 
the system under consideration to be minimum phase.  
For nonminimum phase systems, the design of SMC 
is a challenging problem. Essentially, using only the 
output information in the SMC to stabilize nonminimum 
phase systems is still an open problem. The familiar 
method is dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC) in-
troducing extra dynamics into a sliding surface to im-
prove the system stability as well as obtaining the desired 
system performance [8]. Shtessel and Shkolinikov 
[11-13] applied the DSMC technology where a large 
number of integrators are introduced into a sliding sur-
face to stabilize the internal dynamics. However, their 
control law is necessary for the system state. For a 
growth rate of the zero dynamics that is no more than 
exponential, Lu and Spurgeon [10] developed a dynamic 
sliding mode controller to stabilize nonlinear nonmini-
mum phase systems. Diong and Medanic [3] proposed an 
observer-type sliding surface design and utilized the 
simplex control law for a nonminimum phase system 
without any disturbance. 
Based on the work of Diong and Medanic [3], an 
advanced method for a nonminimum phase with the 
matched disturbance is considered in this paper. First we 
show that the observer-type sliding surface design can-
not obtain the perfect disturbance rejection in the sliding 
mode. As a result, a search algorithm which can reduce 
the effect of the matched disturbance during the sliding 
motion is developed. The parameter matrices in the 
sliding surface are easily obtained by the solution of a 
Sylvester equation. For avoiding measuring the system 
state, Diong and Medanic used the simplex method to 
design the controller. This approach may result in the 
chattering problem. We apply pole assignment to the 
overall system but not in the sliding mode to decide the 
desired sliding motion and to design the control law. 
Hence, our controller easily integrates with the tradi-
tional sliding mode controller which uses the saturation 
function for avoiding the chattering problem. 
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Consider a continuous-time system with the matched 
disturbance:

n p m≥ ≥ ( ), ,A B C  is 
 where it includes m zero eigenvalues and n m v− +  
nonzero stable eigenvalues { }1, , n m vλ λ − +" . Note that the 
eigenvalues { 1, , m}ω ω"  do not exist in (9) and thus, 
have no influence in the sliding mode. Since 
{ }1, , n m vλ λ − +"  possess negative real parts, system (4) 
can be stabilized during the sliding motion. 
Decompose G as [ ]1 2=G G G  where 1 m n×∈G \  and 
. The sliding surface (8) can be rewritten as 2
m v×∈G \
 1 2( ) ( ) ( )p t t= +s G x G tξ  (10) 
where 1 m= =GB G B I . Since the true state is not ob-
tainable for system (1), the sliding surface (10) cannot be 
directly implemented. Hence, we design the dynamic 
sliding surface as

two conditions:

Since two matrices −A BGA  and J are stable, the sys-

system (1) are stable and . For a non-
minimum phase system, although the proposed method is 
able to stabilize the closed-loop system, the perfect dis-
turbance rejection is impossibly obtained. From (12), we 
know that the system performance can be improved if the 
value of

fluence, a search algorithm for T needs to be brought up.

the simulation results presented in Figs. 1-3. Fig. 1 shows 
the trajectories of the system output and Fig. 2 gives the 
responses of the control input. In Fig. 3, the sliding sur-
face is finally restricted to the sliding layer 0.05≤Ps . 
From these Figs., although the plant is nonminimum 
phase and has the unknown disturbance, the system 
output is close to zero and hence the success of the de-
veloped control algorithm is clearly demonstrated. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has considered an output feedback 
dynamic sliding mode control for a nonminimum phase 
system with the matched disturbance. Although the 
perfect disturbance rejection is not obtainable, an ob-
server-type sliding surface design can stabilize the 
closed-loop system. A search algorithm for finding 
these parameter matrices in the sliding surface is de-
veloped to effectively reduce the effect of the distur-
bance. Applying the concept of pole assignment in the 
overall system not in the sliding mode, our controller 
can avoid measuring the system state. The numerical 
example also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm 
should successfully be implemented.
