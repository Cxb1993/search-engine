implicit version of the weighted essentially 
non-oscillatory scheme with anti-diffusive 
flux corrections is adopted for the 2D 
compressible Navier-Stokes equations with 
Spalart-Allmaras one equation turbulence 
model for computing steady-state flows. 
The mapped WENO and original WENO 
with modified smoothness monitor are also 
considered. A new form of numerical flux 
for each of the variant WENO schemes is 
presented, which consists of first-order and 
high-order fluxes.   In order to improve 
the efficiency and convergence to the steady 
state, the lower-upper symmetric 
Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) implicit algorithm 
[8] is adopted. We apply the resulting 
schemes to compute standard transonic 
flows over NACA 0012 and RAE 2822 
airfoils to test the accuracy and the 
improved resolution of contact 
discontinuities of the methods.  In 
additional, we make comparisons in the 
convergence property between variants of 
implicit schemes, includes the original 
WENO scheme, the WENO scheme with 
anti-diffusive flux corrections, the WENO 
scheme with modified smoothness 
indicator, and the mapped WENO scheme 
[5].

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
4.1 FLOW OVER NACA 0012 AIRFOIL 
For comparing with the validations of 
CFDRC-FASTRAN and CFDRC-ACE [10], 
a C-grid topology similar to that used in [10] 
was employed to model the NACA 0012 
geometry. The airfoil was modeled using 
two domains: one domain for the airfoil and 
one domain for the wake. The grid system  
has 121 points on both the upper and lower 
surfaces of the airfoil with 31 points normal 
to the airfoil surface. This grid distribution 
and compared with the experiment. The 
present results are in close agreement with 
experimental data in all aspects. Fig. 8 
shows the contours of constant Mach 
numbers using WENO5-Roe scheme with 
anti-diffusive flux corrections.  All the 
flow features including the front leading 
edge structure, the supersonic pocket and 
shock separation are clearly resolved.  Fig. 
9 shows the convergence history and it can 
be seen that the WENO5-R-AD scheme 
gives better convergence rate in this RAE 
airfoil case. The computed lift and drag 
coefficients of WENO5-R-AD scheme are 
7400.=LC  and 01400.=DC , while those 
by the WENO5-R scheme are 7400.=LC  
and 01450.=DC , respectively.  Again, 
slightly better /L DC C  ratio can be 
obtained by the WENO5-R-AD scheme.  
The experimental values of lift and drag 
coefficients given by AGARD are 
7430.=LC  and 01270.=DC . Fig. 5 
shows the convergence of lift and drag 
coefficients using WENO5-R and 
WENO5-R-AD schemes. A comparison of 
the entropy contours using WENO5-R and 
WENO5- R-AD is given in Fig. 6.  It is 
noted that a noticeable difference in entropy 
production can be observed near the trailing 
edge for the anti-diffusive WENO methods. 
   Our computed results for both the 
NACA 0012 and RAE 2822 airfoils are 
consistent with those given in the extensive 
compendium of results by Holst [15]. 
 
4.3 3D Transonic Flow over ONERA M6 
Wing    
The result of three-dimensional case is 
the transonic flow over ONERA M6 wing at 
a ∞M =0.8395 and with 3.06 degrees angle 
of attack, reference Reynolds 
number, 6106.2Re ×=c . The ONERA M6 
wing is a symmetric airfoil section with a 
sweep angle of 30 degrees. The wing is 
tapered with a taper ratio of 0.56 and has an 
aspect ratio of 3.8. Extensive wind tunnel 
test data exist for the ONERA M6 wing, in 
particular, the pressure data for transonic 
flow conditions [16]. Takakura et al. [17] 
have computed this problem using 
Harten-Yee TVD scheme together with 
Jones-Launder ( ε−k )-model.   For 
comparison with results from 
CFDRC-FASTRAN [14], a C-grid topology 
similar to that used in [14] was employed to 
model the ONERA M6 wing geometry. The 
airfoil was modeled using two domains: one 
domain for the upper surface and upper 
wake with the grid dimension of 97×49×41, 
and the other domain for the lower surface 
and lower wake with the grid dimension of 
97×49×41. The outer boundaries were 
extended to 50 chord lengths in all 
directions of the mesh system. The first grid 
line is at a distance of 510−  chord length off 
the wall, which resulted in a min +y <2.0 
over the entire grid. The grid system was 
generated by letting j=1 plane to be the 
plane of grid points on the upper wing 
surface at the root section. The j-planes 
were then distributed by power law along 
the upper surface to j=33 at the upper 
surface tip. Planes 34 through 41 were then 
rotated in a circular arc to model the wing 
tip. This wraparound wing tip allows the 
modeling of the wing tip as it existed in the 
wind tunnel model. 
   The solutions were calculated using 
WENO5-R and WENO5-R-AD schemes.  
In Fig. 7, we show the surface pressure 
coefficients of the present results and 
compare with experimental data [17] and 
other computations using 
CFDRC-FASTRAN.  It is shown that our 
numerical results are in good agreement 
with the experimental data and are more 
accurate than the results of 
CFDRC-FASTRAN. This test case is at 
transonic condition and results in a double 
shocks configuration, which is evident in 
Figs. 7(a) to (c).  Finally, Fig. 7(d) shows 
the shocks having coalesced to form one at 
the 0.25 chord position and this shock is by 
far the strongest shock of all those observed
