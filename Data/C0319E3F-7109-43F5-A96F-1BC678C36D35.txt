Abstract 
 A nanofilm rotation method was developed to study the rotation of nanograins and the 
formation of various low energy interfaces.  Epitaxial NiO nanofilms were prepared by ion beam 
sputtering on tothe (100), (110), (111) and (112) surfaces of NaCl single crystal.  By overlapping 
of the above films with an angle difference, and annealing at relatively low temperatures the 
nanograins were induced to rotate till a stable interface was reached.  The rotation process and the 
stable interfaces were determined by transmission electron microscopy.  Many new interfaces 
between mixed planes were found, and their orientation relationships and structures were 
analyzed.  The nanograins rotate rapidly initially but slow down near the stable position.  The 
rotation speed increases with increasing temperature and is fast above 200 °C.

 Two NiO films of the same plane were overlapped with a misorientation angle and the 
specimen was annealed to induce the nanograins to rotate to form stable interfaces.  Since these 
nanograins were found to rotate uniformly, the angles between them could be measured easily 
with the angle changes of the respective selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of TEM.  The 
rotation were studied as a function of temperature and time.   
 
 The second purpose of this research is to identify the twist boundaries between mixed 
planes by the nanograin rotation method.  Epitaxial nanofilms of (100), (110), (111) and (112) 
surfaces were prepared on the corresponding surfaces of NaCl single crystals.  Two films of 
different planes were overlapped with a misorientation angle and then annealed till they rotated to 
stable interface.  The orientation relationships are determined and the structures of the interfaces 
were analyzed. 
 
2. Experimental details 
 NiO films were prepared using a radio frequency ion beam sputtering system.  The target 
was a 3-inch-diameter Ni disk of 99.9% purity. The NaCl (001) surface was prepared by cleavage, 
but the (110), (111), and (112) surfaces were prepared by cutting and polishing of NaCl single 
crystals at appropriate angles.  The films were prepared under a working pressure of 5x10-4 torr.  
The acceleration voltage was 700 V, the beam current was 50 mA, the substrate temperature was 
350 °C, the oxygen flow rate was 10 sccm and the deposition time was 20 min.  The specimen 
thickness was about 10 nm. 
 
 The thin film specimens were immersed in distilled water to dissolve the NaCl substrate 
and let the NiO film floating on the water surface.  It was scooped with another NiO specimen of 
certain crystallographic surface, together with the NaVl substrate, with a desired misorientation 
angle between the two NiO films.  The specimens were then placed into furnace to anneal at 
different temperature in air.  After annealing the specimen was immersed in distilled water again 
to dissolve the NaCl substrate and leave the composite NiO films floating on the surface.  It was 
then scooped up from under with a Cu grid covered with carbon-coated collodion film for TEM 
observation.  SAD, bright field image (BFI) and dark field image (DFI) were used to analyze the 
orientation relationships, the interfaces, and the microstructures. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Epitaxial NiO films 
 Epitaxial nanofilms of NiO were successfully prepared on the (001), (110), (111), and 
(112) surfaces of NaCl single crystal.  The diffraction patterns in Fig. 1 show that the nanograins 
are well aligned according to their respective substrates.  A parallel orientation relationships 
between NiO and NaCl of <100> // <100> was always found regardless of the planes of NaCl 
substrate.  The BEI and DFI are shown in Figs. 1e and 1f, respectively, which show that the film 
has grains nm in size. 
 
 The ions of NiO and NaCl of the above surfaces and their overlapping images are plotted 
in Fig. 2.  Since NiO (ao = 0.417 nm) and NaCl (ao = 0.564 nm) have a parallel orientation 
relationship, the misfit between them in the <100> direction is -26%, but every four NiO (100) 
plane and every three NaCl (100) the misfit reduces to -1.2%.  This can be seen in every direction 
in Fig. 2 and a good correspondence of the ions is clear in the figures. 
 
3.2. Nanograin rotation 
 Fig. 3 shows the angles of the nanofilms of (100)/(100) interface annealed at 200 °C as a 
function of annealing time.  The original angle is 15°, which reduces gradually with increasing 
annealing time and reaches 0° after 50 h.  Fig. 3f shows the angles as a function of time, which 
 The (100)/(100) twist boundary at 45° is a special low energy boundary although it is only 
a Σ29a boundary.  The cross section of this boundary was studied with TEM [10], which shows 
that many misfit dislocations are present at the boundary, as expected.  However, the boundary is 
highly symmetrical in the direction normal to the interface, which may explain the low interfacial 
energy [7, 10]. 
 
3.4. Interfaces between mixed crystallographic planes 
 After annealing, good orientation relationship was obtained of these mixed surfaces.  In 
the following report the notation A stands for the  (001) surface, B for the (110) surface, C for the 
(111) surface and D for the (112) surface for easier understanding of the results.  Fig. 9 shows 
the final orientation of the (001)A/(110)B interface after annealing to  stable interface.  The 
orientation relationship is (001)A // (110)B (zone axis), (110)A // (110)B, and (110)A // (001)B 
(relationship 1).  The atomic planes of these two surfaces are shown in Fig. 10, which shows a 
relatively good match of the oxygen ions on this interface.  The interface was reported previously 
in a cross-section view [29].  Looking through the [110]A and [001]B direction in Fig. 9, the 
interface and the diffraction patterns should become those shown in Fig. 11, which is the same as 
reported [29]. 
 
 Fig. 12 shows the final orientation of the (110)B/(111)C interface after annealing to  stable 
interface.  The orientation relationship is (110)B // (111)C (zone axis), (110)B // (110)C, and (001)B 
// (11 2 )C (relationship 2).  The atomic planes of these two surfaces are shown in Fig. 13. 
 
 There are two orientation relationships found on the (111)C/(001)A interface. Fig. 14 
shows the first orientation relationship.  The orientation relationship is (111)C // (001)A (zone 
axis), (110)C // (110)A, and  (11 2 )C // (110)A (relationship 3).  The atomic planes of these two 
surfaces are shown in Fig. 15.  Fig. 16 shows the second orientation relationship of the interface.  
The orientation relationship is (111)C // (001)A (zone axis), (110)C // (100)A, and (11 2 )C // (010)A 
(relationship 3').  The atomic planes of these two surfaces are shown in Fig. 17. 
 
 Fig. 13 (relationship 2), Fig. 15 (relationship 3), and Fig. 17 (relationship 3') show that the 
matches of the oxygen ions on the interface are generally not very good.  This may be due to the 
(111) plane, which has a 6-fold symmetry, is difficult to accommodate with the (100) and (110) 
surfaces 
 
 Fig. 18 shows the final orientation of the (112)D/(001)A interface after annealing to a 
stable interface.  The orientation relationship is (112)D // (001)A (zone axis), (110)D // (110)A, and 
(111)D // (110)A (relationship 4).  The atomic planes of these two surfaces are shown in Fig. 19.  
This orientation relationship is the same as the one shown in Figs. 12 and 13, only the interface 
was (110)/( 111). 
 
 Fig. 20 shows the final orientation of the (112)D/(111)C interface after annealing to a 
stable interface.  The orientation relationship is (112)D // (111)C (zone axis), (110)D // (110)C, and 
(111)D // (11 2 )C (relationship 5).  The atomic planes of these two surfaces are shown in Fig. 21. 
 
 The orientation relationship on the (112)D/(110)B interface, which is not yet performed, is 
inferred to be (112)D // (110)B (zone axis), (110)D // (110)B, and (111)D // (001)B (relationship 6), 
rapidly initially but slow down near the stable position.  The rotation speed increases with 
increasing temperature and is fast above 200 °C. 
 
 Many new interfaces on mixed planes, i.e., (001)/(110), (110)/(111), (111)/(001), 
(112)/(001), (112)/(111) and (112)/(110), with their respective orientation relationships, were 
found.  Except for one case of the (111)/(001) interface, the (110) // (110) orientation relationship 
was found in all the above interfaces.  The interfaces are then the [110] tilt interfaces of mixed 
planes.  The structures of the interfaces were analyzed and discussed. 
 
 
計畫成果自評： 
本研究之成果與原計畫大致相符，研究成果有學術價值，適合在學術期刊發表。以下第
一、二部份已寫成論文寄出發表，第三、四部份還有困難，在審慎分析實驗中。 
 
(1) 已完成NiO與NaCl晶面形成磊晶薄膜，並分析其界面。此為其後實驗之基礎。 
(2) 在尋找可能出現之低能量之Σ界面，本部份成果極為豐碩，發現很多以前未曾報導過
之不同平面之間之界面。並分析這些界面之結構。此為本研究所新發展之奈米晶
粒旋轉法之獨特成果。 
(3) 在溫度及時間之變化下，已完成奈米晶粒在薄膜之轉動狀況之變化。 
(4) 因奈米晶粒轉動速度不均勻，轉動之活化能無法求得。但奈米晶粒之旋轉為先甚快
而後轉慢，與所暸解之界面能與低能量面之角度差（先平緩後陡峭）之關係完全
不符（旋轉應為先慢後快）。此部份完全在意料之外，因此奈米晶粒旋轉之驅動
力亦不得而知。本部份得進行更多實驗，並更進一步做細密之分析才行。
