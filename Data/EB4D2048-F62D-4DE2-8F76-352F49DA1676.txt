dual-stack UE because the destination of the RTP 
packets resides in the IPv6 network. That is, IPv6 
network is unreachable for an IPv4 host. 
To resolve this problem, three solutions have been 
proposed in the literature, including the 
IMS-Application Layer Gateway (ALG) solution [5], 
the Redirect solution [6], and the Interactive 
Connectivity Establishment (ICE) solution [7]. 
These three solutions are described in Section 2. We 
propose an effective solution in Section 3 and 
evaluate these four solutions in terms of network 
node modification, call setup complexity, and RTP 
transmission latency in Section 4. The readers who 
would like to understand detail operations of normal 
IMS can refer to [4].  
 
三、 研究目的與文件探討 
 
The IPv4/IPv6 interworking environment for 
SIP-based VoIP is illustrated in Figure 1. The calling 
party (UE; see Figure 1 (1)) is an IPv4/IPv6 
dual-stack UE. The called party (UA; see Figure 1 (2)) 
is an IPv4-only UA. An IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack Call 
Session Control Function (CSCF; see Figure 1 (3)) 
can be viewed as a SIP server supporting a registrar 
and proxy. A Transition Gateway (TrGW; Figure 1 
(4)) is responsible for translating IPv4 RTP packets 
to IPv6 RTP packets, and vice versa. Similarly, an 
IMS-ALG (Figure 1 (5)) is responsible for 
translating SIP messages. For the three solutions 
described in this section (the IMS-ALG solution, the 
Redirect solution, and the ICE solution), the CSCF is 
required for all solutions while the TrGW and 
IMS-ALG are used in the IMS-ALG solution only. 
Without loss of generality, we assume that both UE 
and UA register their contact information at the 
CSCF in all solutions.

SIP-based VoIP 
 
Consider the SIP registration message flow in 
Figure 2 where UE's IPv4/IPv6 addresses are 
140.113.1.1 and 2001:f18:113::1. UA's IPv4 address 
is 140.113.1.2. The CSCF's IPv4/IPv6 addresses are 
140.113.1.10 and 2001:f18:113::10, respectively. 
In the registration procedure, UE first sends an 
IPv6 SIP REGISTER message to the CSCF with 
both its IPv6 and IPv4 contact information filled in 
two separate Contact header fields (Step 1 in Figure 
2). The CSCF then stores the contact information in 
its registrar database and replies an IPv6 SIP 200 OK 
message indicating that the registration is successful

Step 3. UE learns that UA is in the IPv4 domain 
and replies an IPv6 ACK message to the CSCF. 
Step 4. UE sends an IPv4 SIP INVITE message to 
UA through the CSCF. 
Steps 5 and 6. UA accepts the call and sends an 
IPv4 200 OK message to UE through the CSCF. UE 
then replies an IPv4 ACK message. 
The call is established, and IPv4 RTP packets are 
delivered between UE and UA. 
III. The ICE Solution 
In the ICE solution [7], UE and UA are responsible 
for selecting an appropriate IP version for RTP 
packet delivery. The CSCF translates the IPv4 
packets (at the IP layer) that carry the SIP messages 
(at the application layer) to IPv6 packets, and vice 
versa. However, the IP addresses in these SIP 
messages are not modified by the CSCF except that 
the CSCF will add an extra Via header field 
containing its IPv4 address to the INVITE message 
(so that UA can route back the 200 OK message). 
The call setup procedure (see Figure 5) is described 
in the following steps. 
 
Figure 5: Message Flow for the ICE Solution 
 
Step 1. UE sends an IPv6 SIP INVITE message to 
UA through the CSCF. In addition to its IPv6 address, 
UE includes its IPv4 address in the SDP c/m fields. 
Upon receipt of the INVITE message, the CSCF 
retrieves UA's IP address from its registrar database 
and learns that UA supports IPv4 only. The CSCF 
encapsulates the INVITE message in an IPv4 packet 
and forwards it to UA. 
Step 2. When UA receives the INVTE message, 
the Via header fields are retrieved (to be used for 
creating a subsequent 200 OK message). In addition, 
UE's IPv4 address in the SDP c field is retrieved (to 
be used in Step 6). Since UA supports IPv4 only, 
other IPv6 addresses in the message are ignored. UA 
then creates an IPv4 200 OK message with retrieved 
Via header fields and includes its IPv4 address in the 
SDP c field. The 200 OK message is sent to the 
CSCF in an IPv4 packet. The CSCF then forwards 
the 200 OK message to UE in an IPv6 packet. 
Step 3. After receiving the 200 OK message, UE 
retrieves UA's IPv4 address from the SDP c field (to 
be used in Step 4) and replies an IPv6 ACK message. 
Similar to the INVITE message, the ACK message is 
sent to the CSCF in an IPv6 packet and then 
forwarded to UA in an IPv4 packet by the CSCF. 
Unlike the IMS-ALG and the Redirect solutions, 
the IP addresses for RTP packet delivery are not 
confirmed in the ICE-based call setup procedure 
(Steps 1-3). Instead, they are confirmed after the 
connectivity checks, which are performed before UE 
and UA send the RTP packets to each other. 
Connectivity check utilizes Simple Traversal of User 
Datagram Protocol through Network Address 
Translators (STUN) Binding Request and Response 
messages. Suppose that UE's IPv4 address is X and 
UA's IPv4 address is Y. The connectivity check 
procedure (see Steps 4-7 in Figure 5) is described as 
follows. 
Step 4. To confirm that Y can be used for RTP 
packet delivery, UE sends UA a STUN Binding 
Request message carried by an IP packet with source 
X and destination Y. 
Step 5. Upon receipt of the Binding Request 
message, UA replies a STUN Binding Response 
message with source Y and destination X. When UE 
 6 
support ICE. Also, the called party should be able to 
process the SIP messages that contain IPv6 addresses. 
In the CSCF-Translation solution, the calling party 
needs to select the IP version for RTP based on the 
200 OK message sent from the called party. No 
modification is made to the called party. 
CSCF Modification: In the IMS-ALG solution, 
the CSCF is equipped with IP version comparison 
function and IMS-ALG. In the Redirect solution, the 
CSCF needs to perform IP version comparison and to 
act as a redirect server. In the ICE solution, the CSCF 
encapsulates the SIP messages in IPv4 or IPv6 
packets based on the destination of the SIP messages, 
which is determined according to the standard SIP 
message processing procedure. In the 
CSCF-Translation solution, the CSCF performs IP 
version comparison and translates the IPv6 INVITE 
message into an IPv4 INVITE message based on the 
calling party's contact information. 
Call Setup Complexity: Compared to the 
standard SIP call setup procedure, the IMS-ALG 
solution incurs additional call setup overhead for the 
SIP message translation (between IPv6 and IPv4) 
performed at the CSCF. The Redirect solution 
requires an extra INVITE transaction (including 
INVITE, 302 Move Temporarily, and ACK 
messages). In the ICE solution, extra call setup 
overhead is introduced to carry out the connectivity 
checks. In the CSCF-Translation solution, the SIP 
proxy needs to translate the first IPv6 INVITE 
message into an IPv4 INVITE message. 
RTP Transmission Latency: In the IMS-ALG 
solution, the RTP packets are delivered between the 
call parties indirectly through the TrGW. In other 
solutions, the RTP packets are directly delivered 
between the call parties. We have conducted 
experiments to measure the extra RTP transmission 
delay introduced by the TrGW. In our experiments, 
the TrGW is a PC (with an Intel Pentium 4 3.0GHz 
CPU and 1.0GB main memory) installed with the 
RTP Proxy [12] on Linux operating system. The 
TrGW connects to an IP network through 100 Mbps 
Ethernet. During the experiments, RTP packets are 
injected to the TrGW at the rate of 10 Mbps. Each of 
the RTP packets contains 20 ms voice data encoded 
in G.711 (172 bytes in length). The average latency 
of translating a RTP packet is 5.9 ms. The extra delay 
is more than twice the network latency in most cases 
we investigated. For example, the network latency 
from National Chiao Tung University to ArtDio 
VoIP operator (passing through 7 routers) is 2.012 
ms in average. Therefore, the RTP transmission 
latency in the IMS-ALG solution is about 6 to 8 ms 
more than that in other solutions. 
 
五、 結果與討論 
 
This paper utilized VoIP as an example to describe 
three existing IPv4/IPv6 interworking solutions for 
the SIP-based NGN telecommunication services: the 
IMS-ALG solution, the Redirect solution, and the 
ICE solution. Then we proposed a CSCF-Translation 
solution and compared the new approach with the 
three existing solutions. Our study indicated that the 
RTP transmission performance in the IMS-ALG 
solution is worse than the other three solutions. Both 
the Redirect solution and the ICE solution introduce 
extra call setup messages with extra call setup 
overhead. In the CSCF-Translation solution, the least 
extra call setup overhead is introduced, and no 
impairment is incurred to the RTP transmission 
performance.
