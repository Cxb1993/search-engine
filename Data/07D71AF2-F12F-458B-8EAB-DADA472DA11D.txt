parallel applications is complex and difficult. How to 
dispatch a large scale task executed in cloud 
computing environments is challenging as well. This is 
because applications running in cloud computing 
environment need to conquer some problems such as 
the network bandwidth, the faults tolerance, and the 
heterogeneity. Different solutions to programming and 
tasking in cloud computing environments have been 
proposed by several independent software vendors 
(ISV), each has its own strengths and weakness. Cloud 
computing service providers also have their own 
programming model and APIs to be used by users. 
Here we will briefly introduce the different cloud 
computing perspectives and show our approach in this 
study. Cloud computing currently under development 
consists of three areas, massive computing, 
connectivity, and smart terminal. The aim of cloud 
computing is towards low-cost (saving you money), 
green energy (energy efficiency), and the ubiquitous 
(at any time, any place, any device to access any of the 
services). 
Nowadays cloud computing become a popular 
term with high-tech concept. In fact, these 
technologies are not entirely new, probably inherited 
from the nature of "distributed computing" and "grid 
computing". That is, we divide a large work into small 
pieces because it is of the incompetence in a single 
computer, and then these pieces are carried out by a 
number of computers. After that, compiling their 
findings to complete the work is done. In addition, we 
have devoted to connect a variety of different 
platforms, different architectures, different levels of 
the computer through the network such that all of 
computers are cooperated with each other or network 
makes the computer to do services more far and wide 
in the cyber space, but the difference is that "cloud 
computing" has emphasized, even existing the limited 
resources in a local context, to make use of the Internet 
to access remote computing resources. 
Cloud computing is divided into two categories, 
namely "cloud services" and "cloud technology". 
"Cloud services" is achieved through the network 
connection to the remote service. Such services 
provide users installation and use a variety of operating 
systems, for example Amazon Web Services (CE2 and 
S3) services. This type of cloud computing can be 
viewed as the concepts: "Infrastructure as a Service" 
(IaaS) "Storage as a service" (StaaS), respectively. 
Both of them are derived from the concept of 
"Software as a Service" (SaaS) that is the biggest area 
for cloud services in demand, while "Platform as a 
Service" (PaaS) concept is an alternative for cloud 
computing service. Using these services, users can 
even simply to rely on a cell phone or thin client to do 
many of things that can only be done on a personal 
computer in the past, which means that cloud 
computing is universal. The "cloud technology" is 
aimed at the use of virtualization and automation 
technologies to create and spread computer in a variety 
of computing resources. This type can be considered as 
traditional data centers (Data Center) extension; it does 
not require external resources provided by third parties 
and can be utilized throughout the company's internal 
systems, indicating that cloud computing also has the 
specific expertise. Currently on the market the most 
popular cloud computing services are divided into 
public clouds, private clouds, community/open clouds, 
and hybrid clouds, where Goggle App Eng [1], 
Amazon Web Services [2], Microsoft Azure [3] - the 
public cloud; IBM Blue Cloud [4] - the private cloud; 
Open Nebula [5], Eucalyptus [6], Yahoo Hadoop [7] 
and the NCDM Sector/Sphere [8] - open cloud; IBM 
Blue Cloud [4] - hybrid cloud. 
 
2. Motivation and Background 
 
The main purpose of this study is to build a 
“Private Small-Cloud Computing” (PSCC). The idea 
of private small-cloud computing is based on three 
concepts: small clusters, virtualization, and general 
graphics processor [9]. This cloud system will include 
the use of Xen [10] virtualization technology, VMGL 
[11] planning to use general-purpose graphics 
processors, Open Nebula [5] Management of cluster 
structure, Eucalyptus [6] implementation of the cloud 
controller. 
In many applications, embedded devices often 
require huge computing power and storage space, just 
the opposite of the hardware of embedded devices. 
Thus the only way to achieve this goal is that it must 
be structured in the "cloud computing" and operated in 
"cloud services". The idea is how to use the limited 
resources of embedded devices to achieve the "cloud 
computing", in addition to using the wired Ethernet 
connection, and further use of wireless mobile devices 
IEEE802.3b / g or 3G to connect, as shown in Fig. 1. 
First, we use the standard J2ME [12] environment for 
embedded devices, where JamVM [13] virtual machine 
is employed to achieve J2ME environment and GNU 
Classpath [14] is used as the Java Class Libraries. In 
order to reduce the amount of data transmission, the 
acquisition of information processed is done slightly at 
the front-end embedded devices and then processed 
data through the network is uploaded to the back-end, 
private small-cloud computing. After the processing at 
the back-end is completed, the results sent back to the 
front-end embedded devices. As shown in Fig.2, an 
 4
The host takes a lot of capacity with CPU 
virtualization technologies (VT) [25], a large number 
of CPU computing power, large memory and fast disk. 
In order to verify the cloud system effectiveness and 
efficiency in access security, the experiment on 
fingerprint identification and face recognition by using 
rapid identification in PSCC cloud computing has been 
done successfully within 2.2 seconds in average access 
identification to exactly cross-examine the subject 
identity. As a result the proposed PSCC cloud 
computing has been performed very well when it has 
deployed in local area. Steps are as follows: (a) the 
operation for face recognition is quickly to open the 
video camera for the first, and then press the capture 
button, the program will execute binarization 
automatically as shown in Fig. 14; (b) the rapid 
fingerprint identification is first to turn on device, then 
press the deal button for feature extraction that reduces 
the amount of information as shown in Fig. 15; (c) at 
first the terminal device test the connection if Internet 
is working properly, and then we press the identify 
button and information sent to the cloud, and at last the 
cloud will return the identification results as shown in 
Fig. 16.

5. Conclusions 
 
This study has achieved a “Private Small-Cloud 
Computing” (PSCC) where the cloud computing can 
initiate the cloud services like SaaS, PaaS, and/or IaaS. 
Furthermore, low-capacity Linux embedded platforms 
can be attached to PSCC through the wired or wireless 
networking, for example, Ethernet, WiFi or 3G. 
Finally, the rapid identification fulfills access security 
within 2.2 seconds in PSCC.
