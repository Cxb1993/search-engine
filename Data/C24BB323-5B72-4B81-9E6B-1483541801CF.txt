Viterbi (IMM-EV) algorithm for state  estimation of a class of  Markov jump linear discrete-time 
systems. We develop a maneuver detection scheme, and a method for detecting maneuver 
termination. Both schemes, determining when  switches  between  two IMM-EV algorithms  have  to  be   
invoked, are integrated into the proposed algorithm. Unlike the algorithm given in our previous project 
NSC95-2218-E-033-041, we find that the proposed algorithm is more appropriate for state 
estimation of systems described by the models adopted herein and can achieve significantly 
improved performance. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can be an 
improvement  to several  known algorithms in the literature.  Preliminary results have been presented in the 
17th IFAC World Congress, 2008.  A complete paper is under review by a  highly regarded  IEEE  journal.

I.    INTRODUCTION   
         
 For dealing with state estimation for a class of jump Markov linear systems, the interacting 
multiple-model (IMM) algorithm has been a popular scheme. Besides, several other algorithms 
such as the re-weighted IMM and the interacting multiple-model extended-Viterbi (IMM-EV) 
algorithms have been proposed. In this work, we present a switched IMM-EV algorithm as a 
feasible alternative to the aforementioned  methods.  Unlike the algorithm given in our previous 
project NSC95-2218-E-033-041, we find that the proposed algorithm is more appropriate for state 
estimation of systems described by the models adopted herein and can achieve significantly 
improved performance. Specifically, we use a constant-velocity model which is correct for no 
change occurrences, and acceleration models for covering the system dynamics. The models 
employed  herein can be used to study fault detection and target tracking. 
        The novelty of the proposed algorithm is as follows. We adapt the detection scheme of Bar-
Shalom and Birmiwal (1982) by giving how to determine an appropriate  window length so that  
assuming no abrupt changes, the fading memory average of innovations from the estimator based 
on the most probable model identified can approximately serve as a chi-square detector for 
maneuver detection. The proposed algorithm makes use of switches between two IMM-EV 
algorithms for achieving improved performance. Moreover, we show how to initialize the other 
IMM-EV algorithm adequately when a switch from one IMM-EV algorithm is invoked.  
The operations of the  proposed  algorithm are described as follows. An  IMM-EV algorithm 
which can identify the  most  likely  model   path is utilized if  no  abrupt  system changes  take 
place; otherwise, an IMM-EV algorithm which  can  yield superior performance during change 
occurrences is employed. When a maneuver is detected, we utilize the IMM-EV which can yield

        For state estimation of jump Markov  systems described by  (1)-(2), we have introduced an 
algorithm: the combination of  the IMM-EV( 1=m ) and the IMM-EV( 2=m ). The proposed 
algorithm exploits the combined advantages of two IMM-EV algorithms based on some  pre-
determined switching rules. We  have developed a scheme for maneuver detection and onset 
estimation to invoke a switch from the IMM-EV( 1=m ) to the IMM-EV( 2=m ). Furthermore, we 
have proposed a method  for detecting maneuver termination to invoke a switch from the IMM-
EV( 2=m ) to the IMM-EV( 1=m ). Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm is a 
good alternative to several popular schemes in the literature.

Abstract :  We  consider state estimation for a class of jump Markov linear  discrete-time  systems. For this,  
we   present  an   algorithm employing  switches  among  two  interacting  multiple-model extended-Viterbi  
(IMM-EV) estimators.  The models  we adopt  for describing the systems can  be  used  in problems such as  
the  tracking  of   targets  capable of  abrupt  maneuvers  and  fault  detection  of  systems subject to possible 
component   failures. A  maneuver  detection scheme, and a method for detecting maneuver termination  are  
integrated  into  the  proposed  algorithm. Both  methods  determine when  switches  between  two IMM-EV  
algorithms  have  to  be   invoked.  A numerical  example illustrates  that  the  proposed algorithm can be an

1.  INTRODUCTION 
This paper is concerned with state estimation for  a 
class of jump Markov linear systems shown in Tugnait 
(1982), Bar-Shalom and Li (1993). For dealing with the 
problem, the interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm 
of Blom and Bar-Shalom (1988) has been a popular scheme. 
Besides, the reweighed IMM (RIMM) algorithm of 
Johnston and Krishnamurthy (2001), and some of the 
interacting multiple-model extended-Viterbi (IMM-EV) 
algorithms of Ho (2003), Ho and Chen (2006) have been 
proposed. In contrast, we introduce an approach herein 
using switched IMM-EV algorithms as a viable  alternative 
(in terms of performance improvement) to the 
aforementioned  methods.    
      The novelty of the proposed approach is that it switches 
between two IMM-EV algorithms in an adaptive manner.  
Specifically,  the  proposed  approach  utilizes  an  IMM-EV  
algorithm for identifying the  most  likely  model   path   for 
state estimation if  no  abrupt  system changes  take place, 
and  employs an IMM-EV algorithm  otherwise  which  can  
 
 
yield    superior    performance   in  state  estimation  during  
change occurrences.  We use a constant-velocity model 
which is correct for no change occurrences, and acceleration 
models for covering the system dynamics. Like the models 
of Willsky and Jones (1976), the models employed  herein 
can be used to study fault detection and target tracking.  We 
adapt the detection scheme of Bar-Shalom and Birmiwal 
(1982) and then incorporate it into the proposed approach.  
Assuming no abrupt changes occur, an appropriate  window 
length is determined so that the fading memory average of 
innovations from the estimator based on the most probable 
model identified can approximately serve as a chi-square 
detector for maneuver detection.  When a maneuver is 
detected, we utilize the IMM-EV which can yield superior 
performance in state estimation during change occurrences  
from the maneuver estimated onset   time   to   the  
estimated   time  when  the maneuver is terminated.  During 
the stage of an assumed change  occurrence, a maneuver 
termination is  declared  if  the  constant  velocity  model

maneuver is declared at the time step k ,  a switch from the 
IMM-EV(

estimated maneuver onset time. And the IMM-EV(
2=m
2=m ) 
subsequently updates the state estimates from the estimated 
maneuver onset time to the time step k . From the time step 
1+k  on, the IMM-EV( ) is employed and the 
detection of the maneuver termination is performed 
simultaneously.  A switch from the IMM-EV(
2=m
2=m ) to the 
IMM-EV( 1=m ) takes place when the termination of the 
maneuver is declared.  The  operational cycle is  repeated.  
Accordingly,  the  proposed  tracking  algorithm  is  given  
in  Table III.

 Simulations  are  carried out  based on 100 Monte 
Carlo runs. Figs. 1 and 2 show that the proposed algorithm 
and the IMM yield comparable performance and 
outperform the IMM-EV( ) substantially during the  
tracking of maneuvers.  The IMM-EV( ) performs 
slightly better than the proposed algorithm during the 34
1=m
1=m
th-
40th time steps because the proposed algorithm modifies the 
estimates using the IMM in accordance with  the estimated 
maneuver onset time. The performance of the proposed 
algorithm is superior to that of the IMM before and after 
maneuvers. It is apparent that  the proposed approach  and 
the IMM yield comparable performance when a switch

Abstract :  We  consider state estimation for a class of jump Markov linear  discrete-time  systems. For this,  
we   present  an   algorithm employing  switches  among  two  interacting  multiple-model extended-Viterbi  
(IMM-EV) estimators.  The models  we adopt  for describing the systems can  be  used  in problems such as  
the  tracking  of   targets  capable of  abrupt  maneuvers  and  fault  detection  of  systems subject to possible 
component   failures. A  maneuver  detection scheme, and a method for detecting maneuver termination  are  
integrated  into  the  proposed  algorithm. Both  methods  determine when  switches  between  two IMM-EV  
algorithms  have  to  be   invoked.  A numerical  example illustrates  that  the  proposed algorithm can be an  
improvement  to several  known algorithms.  Copyright © 2008 IFAC

1.  INTRODUCTION 
This paper is concerned with state estimation for  a 
class of jump Markov linear systems shown in Tugnait 
(1982), Bar-Shalom and Li (1993). For dealing with the 
problem, the interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm 
of Blom and Bar-Shalom (1988) has been a popular scheme. 
Besides, the reweighed IMM (RIMM) algorithm of 
Johnston and Krishnamurthy (2001), and some of the 
interacting multiple-model extended-Viterbi (IMM-EV) 
algorithms of Ho (2003), Ho and Chen (2006) have been 
proposed. In contrast, we introduce an approach herein 
using switched IMM-EV algorithms as a viable  alternative 
(in terms of performance improvement) to the 
aforementioned  methods.    
      The novelty of the proposed approach is that it switches 
between two IMM-EV algorithms in an adaptive manner.  
Specifically,  the  proposed  approach  utilizes  an  IMM-EV  
algorithm for identifying the  most  likely  model   path   for 
state estimation if  no  abrupt  system changes  take place, 
and  employs an IMM-EV algorithm  otherwise  which  can  
 
 
yield    superior    performance   in  state  estimation  during  
change occurrences.  We use a constant-velocity model 
which is correct for no change occurrences, and acceleration 
models for covering the system dynamics. Like the models 
of Willsky and Jones (1976), the models employed  herein 
can be used to study fault detection and target tracking.  We 
adapt the detection scheme of Bar-Shalom and Birmiwal 
(1982) and then incorporate it into the proposed approach.  
Assuming no abrupt changes occur, an appropriate  window 
length is determined so that the fading memory average of 
innovations from the estimator based on the most probable 
model identified can approximately serve as a chi-square 
detector for maneuver detection.  When a maneuver is 
detected, we utilize the IMM-EV which can yield superior 
performance in state estimation during change occurrences  
from the maneuver estimated onset   time   to   the  
estimated   time  when  the maneuver is terminated.  During 
the stage of an assumed change  occurrence, a maneuver 
termination is  declared  if  the  constant  velocity  model

IMM-EV(
1=m

estimated maneuver onset time. And the IMM-EV(
2=m
2=m ) 
subsequently updates the state estimates from the estimated 
maneuver onset time to the time step k . From the time step 
1+k  on, the IMM-EV( ) is employed and the 
detection of the maneuver termination is performed 
simultaneously.  A switch from the IMM-EV(
2=m
2=m ) to the 
IMM-EV( 1=m ) takes place when the termination of the 
maneuver is declared.  The  operational cycle is  repeated.  
Accordingly,  the  proposed  tracking  algorithm  is  given  
in  Table III.

 Simulations  are  carried out  based on 100 Monte 
Carlo runs. Figs. 1 and 2 show that the proposed algorithm 
and the IMM yield comparable performance and 
outperform the IMM-EV( ) substantially during the  
tracking of maneuvers.  The IMM-EV( ) performs 
slightly better than the proposed algorithm during the 34

1=m
th-
40th time steps because the proposed algorithm modifies the 
estimates using the IMM in accordance with  the estimated 
maneuver onset time. The performance of the proposed 
algorithm is superior to that of the IMM before and after 
maneuvers. It is apparent that  the proposed approach  and 
the IMM yield comparable performance when a switch 
from the IMM-EV( ) to  the IMM takes place during 
the tracking of maneuvers.  This is due to the appropriate 
selection of the window length  d  for eqn. (3). Moreover, 
because the detection scheme for  maneuver termination is 
adequate, the proposed algorithm and the IMM perform 
similarly when a switch from the IMM to the IMM-
EV( ) occurs. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm 
can switch adequately between the IMM-EV( ) and the 
IMM to achieve desirable performance. The proposed 
approach can outperform the IMM and the RIMM. We also 
show that the RIMM may not be an improvement to the 
IMM. The proposed algorithm and the IMM have similar
