Abstract This paper reports the fabrication of photoelectrode of dye-sensitized solar cells
(DSSCs) using TiO2-modified multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The self-developed
nanofluid synthesis system is employed to make TiO2 nanofluid which has good roundness and
uniform size, at an average particle size of 40 nm. The self-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles, after
being mixed with TiO2-nanoparticle-modified MWCNTs (TiO2-CNT) by sol-gel method, are
deposited in an indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass by electrophoretic deposition method,
thus forming a thin film of TiO2/CNTs of 14 μm thick. As seen from the FE-SEM image and
Raman spectra, the CNTs adhere well to the TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the developed
DSSCs make use of the natural dye extracted from ipomoea. The TiO2-nanoparticle-modified
MWCNTs prepared by sol-gel method can improve the performance of DSSCs by increasing the
short-circuit current density (Jsc). The enhancement of Jsc is attributed to the increased
adsorption area of thin films and the improved interconnectivity among TiO2 particles and
TiO2-CNTs. Experimental results show that TiO2-modified MWCNTs prepared using natural dye
extracted from ipomoea could enhance the light-to-electricity efficiency of DSSCs by as high as
30% (0.278% to 0.359%).

1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have
the advantages of easy fabrication and low
cost. Recent studies show that the
light-to-electricity efficiency of DSSC has
exceeded 10-11%.[1,2] Nevertheless, ever
since its initial development, problems of
efficiency and stability still need to be
overcome. Regarding the preparation of
photoanode in cell dye, mainly rhuthenium
polypyridyl complex nowadays, is employed
to sensitize the titanium dioxide (TiO2)
semi-conductive porous film of nanoscale
crystals. The type of dye being used affects
directly the light-to-electricity efficiency of
DSSCs. Ruthenium polypyridyl complex has
good absorption of visible light, good
chemical nature of converting light into
electricity, and highly stable excitation state.
These advantages lead to its extensive use.
However, rhuthenium polypyridyl complex
contains precious metals, which increase its
cost and cause environmental pollution.
Researchers have investigated the extraction
of natural dyes for DSSCs, which show
satisfactory light-to-electricity efficiency. [3-6]
At present, there are many different methods
for preparing photoelectrodes in DSSCs, such
as physical vapor deposition (PVD) and
chemical vapor deposition (CVD). All these
methods require high power consumption and
vacuum chambers, resulting in higher
production cost. In a broad sense,
electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a kind of
colloidal manufacturing process. It disperses
mainly the charged particles suspended in the
4Technomaterial Co. Ltd., Taiwan) used in this
study were 10-30 nm in diameter, 10-15 μm 
in length, prepared by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD), and had a purity of over
95%. The sol-gel solution was prepared by
blending titanium tetra-isopropoxide
(Ti(OC3H7)4) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries
Co. Ltd., Japan), isopropanol (IPA, First
Chemical Co. Ltd., Taiwan), nitric acid (First
Chemical Co. Ltd., Taiwan), and distilled
water. The weight ratio for preparing the
sol-gel solution was kept at 1:10:1:0.2 for
Ti(OC3H7)4:IPA:H2O:HNO3. [21] The
solution was under reflux at the temperature
of 80°C for 1 hour using a magnetic stirrer.
For each sample, 0.5 g of MWCNT was
mixed with 50 ml of sol-gel solution, and
stirred in closed vials for 3 hours. The
impregnated MWCNTs were separated from
the solution by filtration. The blended
solution was baked in an oven at 80°C for 1
hour, and then sintered in a furnace at 600°C
for 1.5 hours, thus yielding the composite
powder of TiO2-CNT.
2.3 Preparation of natural dye
Ten grams of fresh ipomoea (Taiwan) were
placed in 200 ml of 95 wt% ethanol solution.
Under different preset temperatures (20-80°C),
ipomoea was heated by indirect hydronic
heating in boiling water for 20 minutes to
extract its chlorophyll. The solid residue in
the solution was poured through the filter
paper in a clean and light-free working
environment to remove impurities of the dye
solution, thus giving a pure and natural dye
solution.
2.4 Preparation of photoelectrode for
DSSC
The self-developed arc discharge nanofluid
synthesis system was utilized to prepare a
TiO2 nanofluid with an average particle size
of 40 nm. The prepared TiO2 fluid was
pumped dry by vacuum to become a
nanopowder. After blending 0.35 g of
self-prepared TiO2 with 100 ml of IPA,
followed by addition of TiO2-CNT
(0.001-0.02g) composite powder of different
proportions, an electrophoretic suspension
was made. The electrophoretic suspension
was shaken in an ultrasonic vibrator for 1 hour.
After that, EPD was performed at 14oC.
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the
experimental setup for preparing TiO2/CNT
thin film by EPD. As can be seen, the anode
(aluminum plate) and cathode [7 Ω/sq, indium
tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass] were placed
parallel at a distance of 1 cm in the
electrophoretic suspension. The voltage was
set to be 40 V. In Fig. 1, there are two
electrophoretic baths. Hence, two TiO2/CNT
thin films can be formed for the subsequent
measurement. A TiO2/CNT film of around 14
μm thick was deposited. The thin film had
to undergo sintering treatment at 400°C for 2
hours to increase its compactness. Finally,
the TiO2/CNT film was immersed in natural
ipomoea dye for 24 hours, allowing the
natural dye molecules to be absorbed by the
surface of TiO2/CNT film.
2.5 Assembly and test of DSSC
After dye absorption by TiO2 electrode, the
photoelectrode surface was cleaned using
acetonitrile to remove any natural dye that
had not been absorbed by the TiO2/CNT
nanoparticle surface. Then the DSSC was
placed in quiescence and dried to develop the
photoelectrode of DSSC. In addition, the
oxidation-reduction electrolyte at I¯/I3¯ was
poured into the counter-electrode cracks and
then coated with platinum. The TiO2 electrode
and counter electrode were tightly bonded and
fixed by a binder clip to prevent the
production of air bubble, and a sandwich
DSSC was thus formed. In the performance
test of the prepared DSSC, xenon (Xe) light
of 150 W was selected to simulate the
sunlight (AM 1.5), and an I-V curve analyzer
(Keithley 2400) was employed to measure the
light-to-electricity efficiency of the prepared
DSSC.
Before the test, the distance between light
and the sample was adjusted, and the light
density was set to be 100 mW/cm2. The
measured results was plotted in an I-V curve,
from which the data of VOC (V), JSC
(mA/cm2), fill factor (FF) and η% could be 
further acquired.
6would be lost in the electrolyte solution.
Hence, there were not sufficient dye
molecules to transmit electrons to the
semi-conductive oxide, resulting in reduced
conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
Figure 6 shows the FE-SEM image of
TiO2/CNT thin film prepared by the EPD
process. As shown from the prepared
photoelectrode film in Fig. 6(a), there are
many TiO2 nanoparticles coated on the
surface of CNT. The particles around the
TiO2-CNT thin film are the TiO2 nanoparticles
prepared by the arc discharge nanofluid
synthesis system developed by the authors.
Figure 6(b) shows the cross-section image of
the photoelectrode film after being sintered at
400°C. As can be seen, the prepared
TiO2/CNT thin film is of 14 μm thick and is
highly compact. Figure 7 shows the Uv-vis
(V-650, Jasco, Japan) transmittance spectra of
the composite electrode. As can be seen,
within the range of visible light wavelength,
when more TiO2-CNT nanopowder is added
to prepare the CNT/TiO2 thin film, the
transmittance intensity falls due to the
increase in CNT content in the CNT/TiO2 thin
film. Figure 8 shows the acquired absorption
spectrum of ipomoea leaf extract after UV/Vis
illumination. As seen from the curves of the
spectrum, the absorption of ipomoea extract
fluid peaked at the wavelength of 410 nm.
The amount of dye-sensitizer adsorbed by the
as-prepared TiO2 thin film and the TiO2/CNT
(0.001g) thin film are 1.66 × 10−8 mol cm−2
and 5.32 × 10−8 mol cm−2 respectively.
Figure 9 shows the J-V characteristics of the
prepared DSSCs for the as-prepared TiO2 thin
film and the TiO2/CNT thin films prepared by
mixing TiO2 nanoparticles with TiO2-CNTs at
different proportions in the EPD process. In
Fig. 9, the required electrophoretic suspension
is added 0.001 g, 0.01 g and 0.02 g of
TiO2-CNTs, respectively to 0.35 g of
self-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles and 100 ml
of IPA. Table 1 shows the data acquired from
measuring the light-to-electricity properties of
DSSCs, which were obtained after blending
TiO2-CNTs at different proportions with the
self-prepared TiO2 in the electrophoretic
solution. The data include short-circuit
photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit
voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and energy
conversion eficiency (η). As seen in the table,
the open-circuit voltage increased from 0.54
to 0.56. Furthermore, for 0.001g of
TiO2-CNTs, the value of short-circuit
photocurrent density (Jsc) was found to
increase by 25% from 0.91 to 1.14 mA/cm2
when compared with the prepared TiO2
electrode. However, Jsc decreases (from 1.14
to 1.01 mA/cm2) with the subsequent increase
in TiO2-CNTs from 0.001 g to 0.02 g. Such a
gradual decrease in Jsc with increase in
TiO2-CNTs can be attributed to the increased
number of cracks on the surface of the porous
TiO2 electrode. Consequently, the addition of
TiO2-CNTs enhanced the electrical
conductivity of porous TiO2 electrode, but
decreased the adsorption area of ruthenium
dye and created cracks on the TiO2 film. Thus,
the TiO2-CNTs (0.001g) containing TiO2
electrodes had conversion efficiency
increased by 30% (0.278% to 0.359%), which
was higher than that of the prepared TiO2
electrode of DSSCs. However, the subsequent
increase in concentration of TiO2-CNTs (from
0.001 to 0.02 g) did not further help increase
the conversion efficiency. The
photoelectrodes in DSSCs had their CNTs
modified by TiO2 to become TiO2-CNT
composite powder. The CNTs added could
enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc),
providing more efficient electron transfer
effect and enhancing the efficiency of
photoelectrode. In addition, mixing the
self-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles with the
TiO2-CNT composite powder in the
electrophoretic solution also helps improve
the interconnectivity between TiO2 particles
and TiO2-CNTs, and further enhances the
overall light-to-electricity efficiency of
DSSCs.

1. Introduction
Recent developments in solar energy have led different countries to take a more affirmative
attitude towards the future prospects of solar energy. The current main stream use of single-crystal
silicon solar cells cannot be popularized because of its expensive material. Currently, solar cells
have developed to the third generation, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which receives
increasing attention from researchers due to its inexpensive material. Ever since, Gratzel
introduced the DSSC in the 1990s, its efficiency has been continuously improved and there have
been successive research reports on assembling DSSC in a sandwich structure. DSSC is mainly
assembled from 5 parts, including transparent conducting glass, nanocrystalline semiconductor
thin film, dye sensitized agent, redox electrolyte and counter electrode. Of these, the preparation
method of nanocrystalline semiconductor thin film is an issue that has received much attention
research. This is because with a thickness of only several micrometers, a photo electrode
composed of a mesoporous nanostructure thin film is can achieve a highly specific area for a large
number of dye molecules to be adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles.1) Therefore, the
photocurrent density can be increased to a great magnitude. The material of nanocrystalline
semiconductor thin film is mainly the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle due to its high porosity, high
stability and wide band gap energy. Among the various materials, Degassa P25 nanoparticle for
62. Experimental details
The study takes TiO2 (Degussa P25 with an average particle size of 21nm) as the material
required by the photo electrode of DSSC, and transparent indium tin oxide (ITO, 10/sq,
2.52cm2) conducting glass as the base. The cleaning procedures for ITO are the sequential
cleaning by acetone, secondary deionized water and alcohol with ultrasonic vibration at intervals
of 2 minutes. The electrophoretic suspension liquid is mixed with IPA and TiO2 nanopowder
(TiO2/IPA) at the proportion of 1000: 3, and vibrated in ultrasonic vibrator for 3 hours
continuously. Then, the TiO2/IPA allowed to rest cooled down to room temperature. The
Mg(NO3)2．6H2O with different concentrations (10-5~10-3M) serve as the electrolytes, and the
Zeta potentials are measured for the complex of TiO2/IPA and Mg(NO3)2．6H2O. The surface
energy Zeta potential is in colloidal particles, which could be observed to be in suspension status,
when the measured Zeta potential datum of sample is far away from isoelectric point (IEP), thus
keeping particles at excellent suspension situation.
For the electrophoresis experiment, the anode (Al foil) and cathode (ITO) are placed parallel
in an electrophoretic suspension liquid, with a distance of 1 cm in between. The EPD voltage is
set at 20V~100V. By means of multilayer electrophoresis, the thickness reaches between 10 to
12μm, and then recycle process is undergone for each single layer thin film of the multilayered
TiO2 film, which has to receive heat treatment at 400℃ (10℃/min).
Structural analysis for the composition of TiO2 thin film is conducted by XRD. A FE-SEM is
used to inspect the characteristics of the cross-section of TiO2 thin film and the morphological
characteristics of its surface. In addition, an α-step surface profilemeter is used to measure the
surface roughness Ra of TiO2 thin film on the substrate. The resulting product is compared with a
photo electrode prepared by doctor blade.
2.3 Photo electrochemical measurement
The prepared TiO2 thin film is soaked in 0.5mM of UR- N719 dye (C58H86O8N8S2Ru
produced by Solaronix SA) for 24 hours. Then, it is assembled with the electrolyte (0.05M of I2 and
0.5M of LiI mixed with propylene carbonate) and assembled with a Pt layer of counter-electrode to
8Excessively high electric field intensity in EPD would lead to an excessively high deposition
speed of particles, so the particles cannot be deposited or fall off at advantageous positions, causing
poor uniformity of thickness. Conversely, if low voltage is used, the experimental efficiency will be
reduced. But that causes nanoparticle to stack more well-regulated. The thin film prepared under the
voltage of 40V achieves a good uniformity of thickness. As observed from the SEM image of a
cross-section of thin film, the thickness is around 12μm (Fig. 1). The thickness uniformity of thin
film is a effect essence conversion efficiency of DSSCs module, if thin film thickness is not uniform,
that will cause charge recombination, and the electro-optical conversion efficiency of DSSC will be
reduced. 15,16)
As observed from the SEM image of the thin film cross-section for comparison, in Fig. 2(b), the
sample receives heat treatment at 400oC; and the thin film has more compact organization than the
sample without heat treatment, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Furthermore, gas still exists in the mesopores
of the TiO2 thin film prepared by EPD and this gas and voids can be eliminated after heat treatment
at 400℃ temperature. This will increase the number of TiO2 particles in a unit area of thin film, thus
enhancing the adsorption of dye molecules. In additionally, Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles has
already existed 30% rutile type crystalline. For this reason, the application of commercial
nanomaterial of TiO2 film with photoelectric pole must go through heat treatment after thin film
production, so as to change the crystal structure of rutile to be of anatase crystalline type.17)
As found in the FE-SEM images, there are many fissures on the surface of the TiO2 thin film.
Fissures were caused before sintering, and cannot be improved during sintering. The thin film
fissures have two influences a DSSC: (1) the adherence of TiO2 thin film to ITO surface is reduced,
which causes difficulty in the assembly of DSSC. (2) Since the functional group (-COOH) of dye
molecules has to conjugate with the hydroxyl (-OH) of TiO2, the dye molecules that have not been
conjugated in fissures will be lost in the electrolyte, disabling the transfer of electrons to
semiconductor oxide. The possible reason for the production of fissures is that the selected
electrophoretic suspension carrier liquid is isopropyl alcohol (IPA), which have a high rate of
evaporation. When the sample is taken out of the electrophoresis tank, the stress on the bottom layer
10
of times that multilayer electrophoresis is applied to the fissures on the thin film surface, the film
surface is improved. After 3 cycles of electrophoresis, the fissures on the thin film surface are
greatly improved.
Furthermore, the thin film structure as examined by XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 5, where
Line shows the XRD pattern of nanoparticles deposited at ITO base (TiO2/ITO), and Line b
shows the XRD pattern of ITO base. There patterns, indicator that the anatase structure of TiO2
appears to have peak values at 24°, 38° and 48°; its rutile structure appears to have peak values at
28°, 31° and 62°; and the SnO2 structure of ITO conducting glass appears to have peak values at
30°, 35° and 50°. Through heat treatment method diminishs existing propotion of rutile crystalline,
and to enhance existing percentage of anatase crystalline in further test sample.
3. 3 Fabrication of DSSC and measurement of conversion efficiency
After the TiO2 thin film is soaked in dye, it is assembled with a counter-electrode to form DSSC.
The influence of different number of layer thin films on the I-V curve of DSSC is shown in Fig. 6.
The photocurrent density increases with more layers. The performance of DSSC is shown in
Table 3, where the electro-optical conversion efficiency of 1 layer is η= 2.510%; electro-optical
conversion efficiency of 2 layers is η= 5.381%; and the electro-optical conversion efficiency of 3
layers is η= 6.739%. Compared with 1 cycle of electrophoresis, the electro-optical conversion
efficiency after 2 cycles of electrophoresis is enhanced by 53.4%. Compared with 2 single cycles of
electrophoresis, the electro-optical conversion efficiency after 3 cycles of electrophoresis is
enhanced by 20.2%. The fill factors (FF) of these 3 layers are 60.397%, 56.697% and 55.184%
respectively. Besides, the acquired open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 1 layer, 2 layers and 3 layers are
0.72V, 076V and 0.77V respectively. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of each layer is 5.722
mA/cm2, 12.488 mA/cm2 and 15.86 mA/cm2 respectively. Because of the great reduction of
fissures, many dye molecules are adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, immensely
enhancing the photo current value. In the test of dye adsorption, the model concentration for N719
