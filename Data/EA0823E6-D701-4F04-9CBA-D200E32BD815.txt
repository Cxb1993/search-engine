1. Introduction 
In recent years, microfluidics has become a mainstream technology. It has been demonstrated that 
large-scale laboratory instruments can be replaced by miniaturized systems, which offer a variety of 
advantages, such as reduced reagent/sample consumption, parallel processing, and short turn-around 
times. Many basic analytical steps can be integrated so that complex diagnostic tasks can be 
performed on a microfluidic substrate no larger than a credit card. This kind of system is sometimes 
called a “lab-on-a-chip” (Vilkner et al., 2004). One special type of these ‘‘lab-on-a-chip’’ systems is 
the “lab-on–a-disc” technology, which exploits the centrifugal forces to transport liquids, performing 
processes such as blood sedimentation (Haeberle et al., 2006; Steigert et al., 2006a), 
metering(Andersson et al., 2007; Steigert et al., 2005), mixing(Cho et al., 2007a; Duffy et al., 1999; 
Grumann et al., 2005; Haeberle 2005; Puckett et al., 2004; Rothert et al., 2005; Steigert et al., 2006b; 
Zoval 2004) and detection based on a centrifugal platform. 
Rapid mixing is essential to chemical reactions and biomedical analysis in the microfluidic systems. 
However, since typical hydrodynamic conditions encountered in microchannels are strictly laminar, 
mixing remains a major challenge in microfluidic systems. A few approaches have been attempted to 
achieve effective mixing by diffusion limited speed of mixing(Abonnenc, et al., 2009; Cooksey, et al., 
2009), generating the secondary flow with a three-dimensional structures(Lee, et al., 2009; Tofteberg, 
et al., 2010; Williams, et al., 2008) and utilizing the effect of Dean’s vortex(Ahn, et al., 2008; Mao, et 
al., 2007). On the centrifugal platform, it has been proposed to achieve mixing by utilizing the 
Coriolis force (Ducree, et al., 2006), magnetic beads(Grumann, et al., 2005), and by frequent reversal 
of the direction of spinning(Cho, et al., 2007b; Grumann, et al., 2005; Steigert, et al., 2006c). One of 
the advantages for the centrifugal platform is that it is capable of handling low volume of liquid since 
the liquid driving force is based on the body force. In this work, we present a design for mixing 
solutions with low volume on the centrifugal platform in which the effect of mixing is based mainly 
on the centrifugal force. The mixing mechanisms in the circular and bending sections of the flow 
channels were studied and the mixing efficiency for solutions with various viscosities and operating 
conditions. 
 
2. Experimental 
The flow visualization setup is shown in Figure 1. The spinning control system consists a motor (HC-
KFS053, Mitsubishi), and a motor controller (PCI-7390, National Instrument). The disc is fixed on 
the motor through an aluminum holder.  The rotational speed of the motor is managed by a computer 
program (LabVIEW, National Instrument). The image capturing system is composed of a stroboscope 
(DT-311N, SHIMPO), a triggering sensor and a high speed CMOS camera (SV-642, EPIX). The 
triggering sensor synchronizes the stroboscope with the disc spinning frequency by detecting reflected 
signals from the trigger mark on the disc. The digitized images acquired from the high speed camera 
were then analyzed by the software (NI Vision). 
Food coloring was added to deionized water as the model fluid to assist the visualization.  Model fluid 
was pumped through the channels by centrifugation.  Flowrates were determined by measuring the 
time required for a liquid of know volume to flow through the meandering channel.   
After the mixing process, the image in the detection area was captured by a fluorescent microscope 
(IX71, Olympus) with a cooled CCD camera (DP71, Olympus).  Each captured image is stored in a 
16-bit grey-scale bitmap.  The degree of mixing was quantified by the standard deviation of the 
grayscale value (ranging from 0 to 1) in the image of the mixed solution near the detection area.

有鑑於現有利用擴散作用或外加元件於微流道中混合流體在穩定性與製造方面
仍有不足之處，本發明之目的在於提供一種在離心系統中混合流體的混合裝置
與方法，其係利用離心力使流體於微流道中充份混合，因此容易製造且混合效
果穩定。
１．本發明係利用離心系統所提供之離心力來混合流體，使流體混合流道中的
流體產生離心方向的運動。由於絕大部分流體流動方向垂直於離心力方向，因
此可藉此突破流體間的界面，進而達成快速及有效的混合並且具有高重現性，
所以本發明具有相當穩定的混合效果。
２．由於本發明之流體混合流道係為迂迴設計而具有一個以上之彎折，若複數
流體間具有密度差時，則藉由彎折之設計可改變流體在流體混合流道中的內外
次序，使各流體能夠均勻進行離心方向的運動，以達到良好的流體混合效果。
３．本發明在流道的製作上相當的容易，流體之混合亦無須人工操作，可降低
製作與操作成本，使本發明可推廣至微量反應與檢測市場。
This patent reports a novel mixing design that is able to obtain
fast, batch-typed liquid mixing on a centrifugal platform.  Mixing is
an important procedure for the applications in chemical reactors and
biological assays especially in the field of microfluidics.  Due to
the small-sized geometry in microchannel, it is difficult to achieve
turbulence to assist mixing.  To overcome this problem, a meandering
fluidic design on the centrifugal platform is proposed.  Both
centrifugally induced lateral flow movement and the centrifugally
induced flow focusing effect in the bending section promote the
effect of mixing.  The degree of mixing is quantified by solutions
with various viscosities and an optimal operating flowrate range was
discovered.  Satisfactory mixing for aqueous solution with low volume醫療器材製造業；檢測維護業
