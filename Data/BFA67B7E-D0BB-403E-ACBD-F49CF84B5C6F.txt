Abstract  
It is well known that chemical stresses created by 
concentration gradients during diffusion could be large 
enough to cause dislocation generation. 
While in systems such as metals, surface 
dislocations may be helpful for hardening purposes or 
wear resistance, in semiconductor devices they are not 
desirable. Dislocations created during diffusion can 
increase the effective diffusivity and solubility of the 
dopant and thereby cause overdoping. Their presence 
may alter electronic properties of the materials. Thus, 
diffusion induced dislocations should be avoided if 
possible during the doping of semiconductors. 
It is the purpose of this project, using inverse 
modeling efficiently, to find the diffusion scheme 
during nonlinear dislocation-free diffusion processes.  
 
Keywords: doping of semiconductors, nonlinear 
diffusion, dislocation-free, inverse modeling,  
 
二、緣由與目的 
The diffusion-induced stresses in semiconductor 
materials during diffusion processes have been studied 
extensively over recent decades. The diffusion-induced 
stresses related to the dislocation density was studied in 
detail by Tuck [1]. Lee and Li [2] proposed that the 
most rapid diffusion processes occur without 
generation of dislocation. Menon et al. [3] studied the 
nonlinear diffusion in Cu-Au multilayer thin films. We 
investigated the nonlinear effect of the self-induced 
electric field on the diffusion-induced stresses in a thin 
plate [4] and in a long bar of square cross section 
[5]. 
 The diffusion-induced stresses are built up by 
composition inhomogeneity during mass transfer, i.e., 
they are caused by concentration gradients. The 
diffusion-induced stresses can cause dislocation 
generation which affects solute distribution and 
subsequent electronic properties [6]. According to 
Lee and Li [2], if the diffusion processes can be 
optimally controlled such that the homogeneity of the 
concentration can be satisfied within a short time, the 
diffusion-induced stresses can be reduced significantly. 
A non-linear optimal control algorithm was examined 
in obtaining homogenous concentration for the 
diffusion process of semiconductor materials by Huang 
and Li [7].  
To obtain uniform processing across the 
materials and to prevent the creation of slip 
defects due to chemical stresses, the concentration 
must be nearly uniform on the materials 
throughout the process cycle. Janicki et al. [8] had 
successfully applied an inverse problem algorithm, 
which was implemented as a digital filter, for 
integrated circuit temperature estimation. Kurz and 
Müller [9] presented an inverse-modeling algorithm 
that is able to calculate the powers of arbitrary number 
of heaters in a crystal growth configuration in order to 
obtain a prescribed temperature distribution in a 
growing crystal. The inverse problem deals with 
determining crucial parameters in analyses such as 
those for internal energy sources, surface heat fluxes, 
thermal properties, etc. and has been widely applied to 
many design and manufacturing problems [10, 11]. 
Recently, we [12-15] applied an inverse problem 
algorithm to study the temperature uniformity of 
300-mm silicon wafers during rapid thermal processes. 
2. Inverse Problem Algorithm 
 The inverse problem in application to the present 
nonlinear diffusion process is given 
concentration-distribution history across a thin plate to 
determine the applied unknown  concentration, at 
outer surface, )(ταs  required for achieving 
homogenous concentration during processes The given  
concentration-distribution history is just our desired 
concentration trajectory required for homogeneity. 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that the 
desired concentration trajectory is the surface 
concentration history as calculated from the diffusion 
model given above using constant diffusivity during 
processing [2]. 
The finite-difference method in the diffusion model 
above at  is used to construct the 
following matrix equation : 
τττ Δ== mm
[ ]{ } { } [ ]{ }mmmmm VF ϕθθ += −1 ,           (10) 
Then, the concentration distribution { }mθ  can be 
derived as follows: { } [ ] { } [ ] [ ]{ }[ ]{ } [ ]{ }[ ]{ } [ ]{ } mppmmm

The vector { }1−mθ  contains p  values of the initial 
distribution or the concentration distribution for the 
preceding time step. { }pu  is a unit column vector 
with a unit at the  component.  denotes 
the unknown surface concentration required to achieve 
concentration uniformity during processing. The vector 
thp − mp 1+θ
{ }mV  contains the coefficients for the unknown 
variables .  mp 1+θ
A time-sequential procedure was used to 
determine the unknown unknown surface concentration. 
The time domain was divided into analysis intervals of 
, where 11 −+− ≤≤ rmm τττ r  is the number of future 
time steps. The unknown parameters were determined 
for each analysis interval. For the next time step 
 we arrived at 1+m{ } [ ]{ } [ ]{ }

This equation provides a sequential algorithm that 
can be used to estimate the unknown surface 
concentration required for achieving homogenous 
concentration by increasing the value of  by one for 
each time step. Thereafter, the dynamic surface 
concentration on the the thin plate required for 
maintaining homogenous concentration during 
processing could be obtained. Fig. 2 shows the 
controlled surface concentration by direct constant 
diffusivity diffusion model and by inverse problem 
algorithm, respectively, during processing. Fig. 3 shows 
the inverse results of concentration distributions at 
some intervals.

四、計劃成果自評 
Even if the diffusion-induced stresses can cause 
dislocation generation which affects solute distribution 
and subsequent electronic properties during 
one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion or doping 
processes of semiconductor materials. However, a 
inverse problem algorithm was developed in the 
present study which was able to calculate the 
controlled surface concentration required for 
homogeneity during one-dimensional nonlinear 
diffusion/doping processes of semiconductor 
materials. The inhomogeneity of concentration could 
be acceptable during advanced  doping systems of 
semiconductor materials.
