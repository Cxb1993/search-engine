Abstract 
    This research includes two parts. In the first part, the adsorption behavior and 
electrochemical features of an organic thioether— 3,3’-thiobis(1-propanesulfonic acid, 
sodium salt) (TBPS) on Au(111) electrode were investigated by using cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) and in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Under the 
investigation of STM, an ordered TBPS adlattice can be observed at 0.8 V (vs. RHE) 
and the structure is identified to be (6 × 3√3). When the potential was negatively 
shifted, the TBPS adlayer becomes disorder at ca. 0.7 V and desorbed from the 
Au(111) surface at ca. 0.06 V. The CV spectrum reveals that the TBPS monolayer 
adsorbs stably at the potential range between 0.3 V ~ 1.0 V, and oxidizes when the 
potential was elevated up above 1.2 V.  
    For the second part of this study, electrochemical deposition of copper was 
performed on the TBPS-modified Au(111) surface. The CV results indicate that the 
TBPS adlayer has a slightly enhancement effect to the underpotential deposition 
(UPD) of copper. For the overpotential deposition (OPD), the modification of TBPS 
triggers a one dimensional growth mode of copper, formation of copper clusters with 
rode-like morphology. It’s also found that the deposition rate was also affected by the 
rinsing conditions of the TBPS-modified Au(111) substrates after the self-assembling 
process.

研究目的 
  自 IBM 提出電鍍填充盲孔的機制以來，目前工業界大多使用 SPS 或 MPS 作為
電鍍填孔的加速劑，因此近幾年來其加速機制和電化學基本性質也陸續被學者拿
來討論發表，使得 SPS 和 MPS 在電鍍填孔的機制也日趨成熟完善。然而除上述
兩種加速劑外，有學者發現目前文獻中很少看到類似加速劑之開發與研究，Dow
教授研究團隊選擇類似 SPS化學結構式的藥品進行電鍍填孔測試開發，該藥品為
3,3’-thiobis (1-propanesulfonic acid, sodium salt)，簡稱 TBPS，亦可作為電鍍填孔
的加速劑，其和 SPS最大的差異在於為單硫的結構，屬於硫醚的衍生物。 
因此本實驗將利用電化學掃描式電子穿隧顯微鏡 (EC-STM) 與循環伏安儀 
(CV) 研究TBPS單分子膜在過氯酸溶液下於金(111)表面的行為及經TBPS修飾後
的基板潤洗與否對於電化學鍍銅的影響；而且由於氯離子在鍍銅的過程中扮演電
子傳輸者的角色有助於銅的沉積，故在實驗中另外探討不同氯離子濃度對 TBPS
單分子膜於金(111)上鍍銅的效應。期望藉由 STM 及 CV 電化學分析讓這種新穎
的添加劑在單分子膜及鍍銅上的行為更為清楚。 
 
實驗方法 
將黃金的金屬絲利用濃硝酸及超純水清洗乾淨後，利用氫氧焰將金屬絲末端
熔融成一球狀，將熔融的球體中仔細觀察可看出固態和熔融態界面，控制火焰的
大小，使此界線緩慢的上下移動5至10次後可有效改善金單晶電極中的原子排列
規則度，若快速冷卻會使電極形成不規則多晶狀態。我們可利用單晶球面上所有
的小平面來判斷單晶電極的品質。完成單晶電極製作後，清洗好的金屬電極放在
氫焰上鍛燒數十分鐘，鍛燒金表面時，須小心避免金熔融於高達1063℃的氫焰中，
然後用以通入氫氣之超純水驟冷兩分鐘9,10，隨後將乾淨處理好的金(111)電極浸
入含有50 ppm TBPS分子的過氯酸溶液中約2分鐘，之後再浸到超純水中反覆潤
洗幾次，將殘留在電極表面多餘的分子沖掉，只留下我們所需要的單分子層，最
後快速轉移到EC-STM的電解槽中，並且利用STM在0.1 M過氯酸電解液的條件
下進行金(111)電極表面的分子吸附形態分析或將單晶電極移到CV電解槽中，進
行循環伏安法的電化學分析。

    接下來為了測試 TBPS 單分子膜的穩定性，我們在相同的電位區間下 
(-0.05~1.0 V(vs. RHE)) 作多圈的來回掃描，得到的 CV 圖如【圖 2】所示，再經
過重複的氧化還原之下，C1 的脫附峰和 A1 的吸附峰有逐漸變小的趨勢，而變
小的幅度從第一圈之後開始縮小，推測 TBPS 分子在第一圈脫附的量較多，因此
有大量的 TBPS 穿過電雙層，擴散進入 bulk 溶液之中，因此在掃描至第四、五
圈時，僅僅只是殘存在電雙層附近的 TBPS 分子作脫附再吸附的行為，造成之後
的特徵峰幾乎沒有甚麼變化。在電位 0.3 ~1.0 V(vs. RHE)之間，在經過多圈的掃
描後，該區間的曲線沒有甚麼變化，為 TBPS 單分子膜穩定的區域。  
    
【圖 2】金(111)電極上的 TBPS 單分子膜於 0.1 M 過氯酸下經多圈掃描後得到的
CVs 圖。掃描範圍：-0.05~1.0 V(vs. RHE)。掃描速率：50 mV/s。 
 
    【圖 3】可以看出硫醚難以氧化的特性，由該圖可以發現 TBPS 單分子膜要
到 1.2 V(vs. RHE)以上才會氧化，由於 TBPS 屬於硫醚的衍生物，文獻上得知 11,12
硫醚吸附在金屬上時，C-S 鍵並不會斷，仍然是六個碳的 TBPS 吸附在金上，而
且呈平躺的方式，不只是硫-金的鍵結，同時兩端富有極性的磺酸根官能基和帶
正電之金電極的交互作用，以及碳鏈間的凡得瓦作用力，三者的影響之下，使得
整個單分子層穩定不易氧化。

    實驗結果如【圖 5】所示，當電位往負掃描時，在 -0.50 V(vs. RHE)左右可
以發現 C1 的還原峰，對該脫附峰積分後得到 54.63 ± 0.05 μC/cm2，其面積代表
參與反應的電荷量，計算後得到TBPS單分子膜在金(111)上的覆蓋率為 0.23 ML。
由該實驗可以證明 TBPS 吸附在金(111)電極上乃是化學吸附，和文獻中硫醚分子
的吸附沒有斷 C-S 鍵的結果對照之下 14,15，我們推測 TBPS 吸附在金上極有可能
經由「配位共價」的方式，即硫原子上的孤對電子和金的空軌域形成「硫-金配
位共價鍵」的方式來作鍵結。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
【圖 5】 經 TBPS 修飾後的金(111)電極在 0.1 M KOH 下得到的脫附曲線。掃描
速率：50 mV/s。 
 
接下來，我們利用定電流模式的 STM 在 0.1 M 過氯酸溶液下觀察經 TBPS 修飾
的金(111)表面。在 OCP (0.7 V(vs. RHE)) 時可以觀察到 TBPS 的單分子膜，且有
部份的規則結構產生。當電位調至 0.8 V(vs. RHE)時，如【圖 6】(a)所示，可以
明顯觀察到大範圍的 TBPS 規則吸附結構，伴隨著一些顏色比較暗的暗點，這些
暗點是由於 TBPS 在自組裝的過程中，因硫-金之間的作用力移動第一層金原子
後所產生的缺陷。和硫醇比較後，發現硫醇蝕刻的情況更明顯，所以在表面產生
的坑洞（暗點）比較多且密集，使得規則結構出現的區域受到擠壓；反之，TBPS
出現的蝕刻洞比較少量，使得在該電位下形成規則結構的區域相對來說就大很多，
而且從【圖 6】(a)另外可以觀察到這種缺陷不會在能量較高的台階附近產生，傾
向在平台上形成。放大白色方框的區域可以得到解析度較高的小範圍 STM 圖，
從【圖 6】(b)可以看出，規則結構區域 A、B、C 有三種不同的分子排列位向，
測量其夾角發現 AB 及 BC 區域各夾 120 度角，為同一種結構。白色箭頭所指之
處為上述所提到的缺陷處。

的魚骨狀重排產生如【圖 8】(d)，表示 TBPS 分子在該電位下產生大量脫附的行
為，使得下層的金原子能夠被觀察到，在 STM 高解像裡面，甚至可以觀察到金
載體排列的方向，如【圖 4-12(d)】黑色方框內虛線區域所示。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
【圖 8】用 STM 觀察 TBPS 單分子膜的在金(111)表面上的脫附過程，圖(a)到(d) 
分別表示在不同的電位之下得到的 STM 影像圖─ 0.75、0.55、0.25 及 0.1 V (vs. 
RHE)。(a)到(d)的掃描範圍皆為 200 × 200 nm2。黑色方框內為圖(d)的 STM 高解
析影像，掃描範圍為 10 × 10 nm2。 
 
由以上一系列的實驗，對於 TBPS 自組裝單分子膜在金(111)上的特性有一定
程度的了解，之後的實驗將針對經 TBPS 修飾的金(111)電極作銅沉積效應的探
討。 
首先我們先在金(111)上自組裝一層TBPS單分子膜，隨後將電位固定在 0.8 V 
加入 1 mM 的過氯酸銅 (Cu(ClO4)2，使溶液中銅離子濃度達 77 μM，進行循環伏
安法的實驗。實驗結果如【圖 9】所示，實線是經 TBPS 修飾後的金(111)下去鍍
銅的結果，在 0.50V 可以觀察到 UPD 的還原峰 C1’，和乾淨未修飾前的金(111)
作比較(虛線)，其 UPD 產生的位置幾乎沒有甚麼差異；不過當電位繼續往負掃
描，在- 0.05 V(vs. RHE)時就觀察到有氫氣的產生，而乾淨未修飾前的金(111)其
氫氣產生的電位在則是在 -0.15 V(vs. RHE) 的位置。當電位往正回掃時觀察到
A2’的氧化峰電流密度較未修飾前的 A2 氧化峰較小，且形狀變得較寬，然而去
測量其電量大小為 165 μC/cm2，而 A2 氧化峰的電量只有 136.7 μC/cm2。將還原
曲線的部份放大如【圖 10】所示，可以明顯觀察到 0.5 V(vs. RHE) 的 UPD 還原
峰 C1’ 及在 0.1 V 左右的 OPD 還原峰 C2’，針對 C1’去作積分，得到的電量為
62.54 μC/cm2，覆蓋度約為 0.14 ML，其值比 C1 的 UPD 還原峰高。

時，可以觀察到原本平滑的台階邊緣產生鋸齒狀的形狀 (見【圖 11】(b)白色箭
頭所指之處)，表示銅開始在能量較高的台階邊緣作低電位的沉積；隨著時間的
增加，銅在台階邊緣沉積的量也逐漸變多，當電位調整至 0.42 V(vs. RHE)時可以
發現台階前緣有逐漸擴大的趨勢，如【圖 11】(c)白色箭頭所示，表示銅低電位
沉積的行為仍然持續發生，然而在遠離台階的平臺上幾乎沒有任何銅的沉積，量
其高度仍是一個 TBPS 分子層的厚度。當電位再往負調至 0.37 (vs. RHE)V 時，
如【圖 11】(d)所示，平臺上才開始有一些比較亮的亮點產生，代表銅準備在該
處成核成長，另外觀察台階邊緣，發現有明顯的變亮，說明銅仍傾向在該處進行
沉積。 
    隨著電位繼續往負偏移，可以發現除台階邊緣，平臺上銅沉積的量也開始變
多，而沉積的方式受到 TBPS 單分子膜的影響呈現二維的條狀沉積，至 0.15 V(vs. 
RHE)時幾乎蓋滿整個表面，達到一個穩定的狀態，如【圖 11】(e)所示。根據 CV
的結果，此時已進入大量沉積的電位區間，所以當電位繼續偏移至 0.05 V(vs. RHE)
時，銅的二維條狀沉積模式持續的進行，在表面的覆蓋度也越來越高，量其剖面
發現高度為 0.25 nm，只有一個銅層左右的高度，如【圖 11】(f)所示。由此可見，
自組裝單分子膜的不同，與銅離子的交互作用也會不同，而影響銅在低電位及過
電位的沉積模式，如果是類似結構的 SPS 單分子膜進行鍍銅，在低電位沉積的
過程，銅離子會在平臺的缺陷處成核成長，而形成大小均勻的島狀物散佈在平臺
上，當進入大量沉積的區域時，則會在島狀物上進行三維的成長方式。

300 nm

為了進一步了解銅於過電位的沉積型態，我們於 0.15 V(vs. RHE)之電位下作
詳細的觀察，由【圖 12】(a)可以看出，銅的條狀沉積方式變得更為明顯且相當
12 
 
結論 
    由電化學分析及 STM 的觀察，我們完整了解到 TBPS 單分子膜的一些重要
性質。由循環伏安法的實驗中，顯示 TBPS 單分子膜穩定而不易氧化，表現出一
般硫醚的特性；從脫附實驗的過程中，發現 TBPS 進行還原脫附的反應，證明
TBPS 吸附在金電極上經由化學鍵結的方式，在 STM 得實驗中觀察到 TBPS 以平
躺的方式形成 (6 × 3√3) 的結構於 0.8 V(vs. RHE)時。上述結果和相關文獻作結
合得知，TBPS 藉由中間硫的未共用電子對和金原子以配位共價的方式形成化學
鍵結，過程中並未包含碳硫鍵的斷裂。在 TBPS 分子修飾過的金(111)電極在電化
學鍍銅的過程中，低電位沉積的電位和沒有經過分子修飾的情況差不多，但積分
得到的電荷量稍大，顯示 TBPS 單分子膜對銅沉積有些微的促進效果。在 STM
觀察下，銅的低電位沉積僅發生在台階邊緣，過電位沉積則和 TBPS 形成複合體
沿載體方向進行二維的條狀沉積模式。

1. INTRODUCTION
Surface-active organosulfur compounds that form well-or-
dered, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on single crystal gold
surfaces have attracted a lot of attention since they allow
chemical, physical, and electron-transfer properties to be tailored.
SAM-modiﬁed surfaces have been used in many technological
applications including biosensing, biomimetics, corrosion inhibi-
tion, wetting inhibition and nanolithography.14 Organosulfur
molecules with short alkyl chains are also frequently employed as
additives in modern electroplating baths.5
While SAMs of alkanethiols and dialkyl disulﬁdes have been
extensively studied by various techniques69 the nanoscale
assembly of dialkyl sulﬁdes on metal surfaces has been character-
ized only sparsely under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV),1012 under
gas atmosphere,1319 and in electrochemical environment.20,21
These studies revealed ordered adlayer structures and novel
properties of monosulﬁde molecules, for example, a low su-
sceptibility to oxidation, an intact adsorption (no CS bond
cleavage)18 and an orientation of alkyl chains parallel to the
surface.11,22 Transitions from an unordered phase to several low
coverage (stripe) phases10,15,22 and rarely to more close-packed
adlayers with out-of-plane tilt of the terminal chains19,23 were
determined. The moleculesubstrate interaction was shown to
depend on the identity of the side chains and ranges fromweak to
strong interactions which can be almost comparable to those of
alkanethiols and disulﬁdes on gold.12,14,16 The possibility to
create stable, quasi-two-dimensional SAMs with a deﬁned lateral
spacing between the functional groups makes dialkyl sulﬁdes
attractive for a variety of self-assembly applications.
In this paper we present a detailed study of 3,30-thiobis(1-
propanesulfonic acid, sodium salt) (TBPS) SAMs on Au(111)
electrodes in aqueous perchloric acid solution. TBPS is a
thioether derivative (NaO3S(CH2)3S(CH2)3SO3Na)
with comparatively short alkyl chains and two terminal groups
of sulfonate. In the ﬁrst part of the paper we will describe our
experimental data acquired by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in TBPS-free and TBPS-
containing electrolytes. In contrast to ex situ characterization of
SAM-modiﬁed surfaces, in situ STM experiments allow the
monitoring of structural changes in the molecular adlayer as a
function of time and electrode potential. The latter induces
Au(111) surface reconstruction, alters the electric ﬁeld of the
electrochemical double layer, and determines the amount of
adsorbed molecules and coadsorbates. We will demonstrate that

ABSTRACT: Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 3,30-thiobis(1-propane-
sulfonic acid, sodium salt) (TBPS) on Au(111) electrodes have been char-
acterized by scanning tunnelingmicroscopy and cyclic voltammetry in aqueous
perchloric acid solutions. TBPS exhibits an adsorption behavior typically
observed for dialkyl sulﬁdes including intact adsorption and low coverage
phases with molecules predominantly lying ﬂat on the surface. On the other
hand, an untypical chemical bond and well-ordered domains were determined
which resemble the characteristics of alkenethiol SAMs. When the adlayer was
prepared at its open circuit potential (OCP), a (6 3√3) TBPS adlayer phase
was observed at potentials E > 0.7 VRHE in TBPS-free electrolyte. At more
cathodic potentials, the adlayer transforms irreversible to a disordered phase. In
contrast, in situ STM studies in TBPS-containing electrolyte reveal a very complex, potential-dependent adsorption behavior. With
increasing electrode potential, the structure of the adlayer transforms in sequence from a disordered phase σ, to a low coverage stripe
phase R, to a high coverage stripe phase β, and ﬁnally to a disordered aggregate phase σa. The reverse cathodic sweep shows
transitions from σa to β, back to σa, and to an ordered adlayer phase γ. All of these phases signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the (6 3
√
3)
phase and are not transient phases at OCP. This behavior is attributed to the inﬂuence of the electrode potential on intermolecular
and moleculesubstrate interactions as well as on the TBPS coverage. Furthermore, the cathodic deposition of AuTBPS
complexes results in the formation of Au islands with fractal morphology.

at ≈0.55 V. The double layer capacity is approximately twice as
large as the capacity of the bare surface.
The inset of Figure 1a shows a CV at more positive potentials.
The TBPS adlayer is electrochemically stable from 0.3 to 1.2 V
which marks the onset of oxidative desorption. This high stability
may be caused by strong interactions between Au surface atoms
and the TBPS molecules, that is, chemical adsorption is inferred.
According to the literature, no CS bond cleavage was observed
for similar molecules.18,33 Therefore, the adsorption of TBPS
should result from the interaction of lone-paired electrons of
sulfur atoms to the Au substrate. The latter gets support from
spectroscopic data of Takiguchi et al. which indicates dative
bonds between sulfur and Au surface atoms.23 At very positive
potentials, the sulfonate groups should as well interact with the
Au substrate due to electrostatic forces.
In order to determine the charge transfer associated with
TBPS desorption, additional experiments have been carried out
in 0.1 M KOH solution. As can be seen in the cathodic potential
sweep of Figure 1b, the desorption peak at0.51 V (C1) is much
sharper in alkaline electrolyte and well separated from the HER.
Peak integration yields a charge transfer of 28.7 μC/cm2.
Considering the density of adsorption sites on Au(111) electro-
des (1.38 1015 cm2) and a charge transfer of one electron per
molecule, the TBPS coverage is θSAM = 0.13 ((0.03) monolayer
(ML). The error was estimated with regard to recent studies,
which revealed errors of up to 20% for monolayer coverages
obtained by this method.3436
Au(111) in TBPS Solution. Figure 2 shows twoCVs of Au(111)
in 0.1 M HClO4 containing 155 μM TBPS (dE/dt =50 mV/s).
The first potential cycle (solid line) was acquired two minutes
after dipping the Au(111) electrode at open circuit potential
(OCP,≈0.75 V). Although the CV shape closely resembles that
of TBPS-modified electrodes (Figure 1, solid line) four addi-
tional small current peaks can be identified. The two cathodic
current peaks with maxima at 0.19 V (C2) and 0.64 V (C3), as
well as the anodic current peak at 0.56 V (A2), correlate with the
weak characteristics in the CV of premodified electrodes, i.e.,
with the shoulder of C1 at≈0.2 V and with the bulges at 0.7 and
0.55 V, respectively. The fourth current peak (A3) emerges at 0.8
V in anodic scans. However, the presence and characteristics of
these peaks strongly depend on the surface quality (e.g., on
sample pretreatment), on the number of CV cycles, and on the
potential sweep rate. Particularly sensitive to surface quality are
C2 and A2 whose amplitudes changed markedly in independent
experiments. The dependence of the CV profile on sweeping is
illustrated by the fourth potential cycle (Figure 2, dotted line).
With each cycle the amplitudes of C3 and A3 decrease and both
peaks gradually shift toward more positive potentials. The latter
is not observed at a lower potential sweep rate of 5mV/s (inset of
Figure 2) and the peaks are found at 0.53 V (A2), 0.76 V (A3),
and 0.64 V (C3), respectively.
3.2. Scanning TunnelingMicroscopy Study. TBPS-Modified
Au(111). The structure of TBPS SAMs on Au(111) has been
characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy. For this inves-
tigation the Au(111) electrode was first immersed for 2 min in
0.1MHClO4 containing 155 μMTBPS, then rinsed withMilli-Q
water, and transferred to the electrochemical STM cell. Figure 3a
shows an STM image of the as-prepared electrode at 0.8 V which
is close to the open circuit potential (≈0.75 V). The spontaneous
adsorption of TBPS molecules results in well-ordered domains
with many depressions (dark circular areas), resembling the
adsorption behavior of alkanethiols37 and thioethers.14,17 Under
the observation of STM at 0.8 V, nearly all the Au(111) surface
was covered by an ordered adlayer. For the short immersion time
(2 min), ordered regions with a low defect density are obtained.
The domain sizes range from 160 to 850 Å (≈410 Å in average)
and domains are clearly separated by a network of light domain
boundaries. A close-up view of the SAM (Figure 3b) shows three
types of TBPS domains (A to C) which are rotated by 120 with
respect to each other. All domains exhibit the same adlayer
structure on top of the 3-fold symmetry substrate.

ing 155 μMTBPS. Solid and dotted curves represent the ﬁrst and fourth
potential cycle, respectively. Data in TBPS-free solution are shown by
the dash-dotted line. The potential sweep rate was 50 mV/s. The inset
shows data at a lower sweep rate of 5 mV/s.

arrangement of atoms with nearest neighbor distances of

less denseR phase to the more compressed β phase. This process
may also account for the short-range order and smaller domain
sizes in the β phase. Similar defects in the molecular adlayer have
been reported for dioctadecyl sulﬁde (DOS) SAMs.17 At poten-
tials more positive than 0.8 V, the STM images show no clear
domain structure (Figure 6f) indicating an order/disorder transi-
tion within the TBPS adlayer. Noh et al. reported a similar surface
morphology for DOS SAMs and attributed small nucleations
with a size of 5 nm to aggregations of DOS molecules.16 The
disordered aggregate phase will be referred to as σa in the
following. The β f σa transition corresponds to the current
peak A3 in the cyclic voltammogram (Figure 2).
On the reverse cathodic sweep, a diﬀerent behavior is ob-
served. At potentials >0.8 V the surface is covered by σa. Stripe
phase β reappears negative of 0.8 V (Figure 6g) and is stable
down to 0.65 V. Although the order/disorder transition is
reversible, no cathodic current peak is observed in the cyclic
voltammogram (Figure 2) indicating that the structural change
from σa to β is a very slow process. The formation of large
domains is strongly hindered by a high defect density within the
TBPS layer, triggering an average domain size smaller than
10  10 nm2 (Figure 6h). Negative of 0.65 V, the TBPS layer
becomes disordered. This order/disorder transition corresponds
to the current peak C3 in the cyclic voltammogramm (Figure 2).
The surface morphology (Figure 6i) diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
phase σ at similar potentials in the anodic sweep (Figure 6b) but
resembles the morphology at 0.85 V (Figure 6f), i.e., phase σa. At
0.3 V, corresponding to a steep increase in the cathodic current
density (see CV in Figure 2), islands are observed on the
Au(111) surface (Figure 6j). These islands have an average
domain size smaller than 10  10 nm2 and exhibit an ordered
structure with a height of 0.060.1 nm (inset of Figure 6j). The
latter suggests an ordered TBPS adlayer. The islands—termed as
phase γ in the following—are observed in a narrow potential
regime around 0.3 V and disappear completely once the potential
is lowered to 0.23 V, i.e., in the advance of TBPS desorption.
However, the origin, the composition, and the stability of γ are
not clear at present and require further investigations.
At Ee 0.2 V small Au islands appear on the Au(111) surface
with a characteristic fractal shape and a height of ≈0.24 nm.
Figure 6k shows the deposit morphology at 0.1 V. In addition,
fractal growth at terrace steps is observed, which suggests that
gold atoms originate from the solution bulk. It is inferred that
gold complexes may be produced at more positive potentials
due to the etching function of TBPS to the Au surface. These
complexes can be reduced at suﬃciently negative potentials
(E e 0.2 V), leading to the redeposition of gold atoms. After a
time span of≈3 h at 0.1 V all small islands disappeared and the
surface is covered by large circular, fractal shaped Au islands
(Figure 6). This behavior indicates a time dependent Ostwald-
like ripening process based on surface transport of Au adatoms
or adsorbed AuTBPS complexes. The onset of Au redeposi-
tion correlates with the current peak C2 in the cyclic voltam-
mogram. In addition, a low number of comparatively large etch
pits provide evidence for a similar ripening process of Au vacancy
islands.

phase (γ), and the redeposition of AuTBPS complexes were
observed. All of these phases diﬀer from the TBPS SAM prepared
at OCP. In the potential regime where the (6 3√3) structure is
stable (E > 0.7 V), the β phase is formed. It is remarkable that the
coverages of both phases are similar (θSAM ≈ θβ = 0.11 ML)
although the lateral arrangement of molecules is very diﬀerent.
This strongly indicates that β is not a transient phase formed at
OCP. Stripe phaseR forms in a potential regime (E < 0.7 V)where
the TBPS adlayer is disordered in 0.1 MHClO4. A transition from
theR phase to the (6 3√3) phase (note that θR < θSAM) would
require a substantial rearrangement of TBPS molecules including
lateral displacements of the sulfur headgroups, as well as lateral
reorientations of all alkyl chains. For this reason and due to a
pronounced stability of stripe phases (see below), it is assumed
that R is not a transient phase at OCP either.
The absence of TBPS stripe phases at OCP is remarkable since
previous studies reported stripe phases of thioethers during the
self-assembly process.10,15 Only under potential control did the
stripe phases appear in the present study. In this context, it is
interesting to compare R and β with SAMs of dibutyl sulﬁde
(C8H18S, DBS) which were formed from the gas phase on
reconstructed Au(111) at low temperature (T = 120 K), i.e.,
far from thermal equilibrium.10 DBS closely resembles TBPS
with terminal groups of methyl instead of sulfonate. Bellisario
et al. reported a (10  √3) DBS stripe phase. The molecular
arrangement of DBS is very similar to the β phase including
intermolecular spacings and the orientation of domains with
respect to the Au substrate. According to Bellisario et al., the DBS
stripe phase is stabilized by van der Waals forces between
adjacent alkyl chains and signiﬁcant stripe-to-stripe interactions.
On the basis of this interpretation, the present data suggest that
the R phase forms at cathodic overpotentials because of a more
repulsive, electrostatic interaction between Au atoms and the
sulfonate groups, which likely favors lateral interactions between
the molecules. That is, the Au surface charge governs the relative
strength of intermolecular and moleculesubstrate interactions.
Suﬃciently negative potentials should weaken the tail group
inﬂuence mentioned above, allowing TBPS stripe phases to be
formed. A similar ordering of molecules into stripe phases under
the assist of the functional groups has been found for several
sulfonate species;56,57 i.e., the inﬂuence of sulfonate groups on
the self-assembly process seems to be a more general
phenomenon.
TBPS stripes tend to be stable at appropriate electrode
potentials. This is indicated by the R f β phase transition, i.e.,
the (6 3√3) phase is not formed, and by the fact that R and β
are kinetically stable for at least 2 h at constant potentials of 0.55
and 0.72 V, respectively (not shown here). The surface mor-
phology during the Rf β phase transition suggests that TBPS
molecules in neighbored stripes move closer together to form a
more densely packed adlayer. A similar mechanism was observed
for alkanethiols under UHV conditions in the initial stage of the
self-assembly process.58,59 However, in contrast to alkanethiols,
TBPS forms “lying-down” phases without a pronounced out-of-
plane tilt or interdigitation of the alkyl chains.
Our data furthermore suggest that the presence of an TBPS
adlayer structure depends not only on the applied electrode
potential but also on the phase from which it was formed.
Particularly, the disordered phases σ and σa have a pronounced
inﬂuence on adlayer structures. The low coverage stripe phase R
has been only observed in anodic sweeps and apparently requires
a disordered phase σ as indicated by the fact that it does not form
from σa or β at the same electrode potential in cathodic sweeps.
Growth at the domain boundaries suggests an attachment of
single TBPS molecules to the end of existing stripes. While σ is
expected to contain suﬃciently mobile and weakly interacting
TBPS molecules, the aggregates in σa may exhibit either a
substantial stability or a high molecule density which prevents
the formation of the R phase. Likewise, the βf σa transition in
cathodic sweeps, i.e., the absence of R, may be caused by an
excess amount of≈69% TBPS in the β phase. The β phase forms
either by compression of the R phase or from σa, suggesting that
β and σa have similar coverages. The γ phase forms from σa in
cathodic sweeps and apparently requires both a comparatively
negative potential and a suﬃcient amount of TBPS molecules.
However, all transitions indicate a dependence on the amount of
adsorbed TBPS in analogy to the results of previous gas phase
deposition studies which demonstrated that structural transitions
in molecular adlayers can be induced by altering the surface
coverage.59
TBPS has an impact on metal deposition processes. The
deposit morphology obtained after deposition of AuTBPS
complexes is characterized by two-dimensional, fractal-shaped
Au islands and diﬀers from 3D growth with pyramidal islands
which has been reported previously for Au homoepitaxial growth
in molecule-free, chloride-containing electrolyte.60 Nucleations
in the center of terraces, as well as the long time scale of an
Ostwald ripening process, indicate a low surface mobility of Au
adatoms or AuTBPS complexes in the present study.
5. CONCLUSION
We have presented a cyclic voltammetry and scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy study of Au(111) in TBPS-free and TBPS-
containing electrolyte. Although SAMs are frequently prepared
from the solution phase, in situ studies of adsorption processes
are still rare, in particular far from equilibrium conditions. Our
data demonstrate that various ordered adlayers can be formed,
controlled, and to some extent stabilized by applying appropriate
electrode potentials. TBPS shows partly the characteristics of
dialkyl sulﬁdes (intact adsorption, low coverage phases) and
partly the characteristics of alkanethiols (chemical bonds, highly
ordered domains). This behavior is evidence of a pronounced
inﬂuence of the sulfonate functional groups on adsorption and
self-assembly processes. An important factor determining the
adlayer phase is the electrode potential which allows control over
moleculesurface interactions and lateral van der Waals forces.
This eﬀect leads to TBPS stripe phases at cathodic overpoten-
tials. Due to the interesting, potential-dependent adsorption
behavior and the inﬂuence of TBPS on metal deposition TBPS
may be an attractive molecule for technological applications.
