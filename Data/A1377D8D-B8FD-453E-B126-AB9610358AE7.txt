2摘 要
吸附法為常見的廢水處理方法之ㄧ，目前當做吸附劑且實際應用中的以活性碳最
常見，但是價格昂貴為一大缺點，無法廣泛地被應用，雖然近年來已經有在尋找替代
性的吸附材料，但是處理的效果與回收仍有待探討。磁性顆粒的優點在於藉由外加磁
場即可達到分離的目的，於 Fe3O4 磁性顆粒表面包覆 SiO2，可保護磁性顆粒使其避免
在水溶液中水解而遭受破壞，將包覆完的 Fe3O4 再以氨丙基三乙氧基矽烷(APTS)修飾，
使 SiO2 表面能接上 NH2 官能基，利用此胺基對水溶液中的銅離子進行吸附實驗，實驗
以等溫吸附實驗(10~50oC)進行，將等溫吸附實驗數據代入分析後發覺其符合 Langmuir
吸附模式分析，並藉由此方程式估算其最大吸附量。

Abstract
Adsorption has been shown to be a feasible method to remove organic or inorganic
pollutant from water. The smaller size of adsorbent possesses larger surface area and causes
higher adsorption efficiency. Removing such fine particles from large volumes of water
involves further expense. This presents a major drawback to the application of this adsorbent
for treating pollutants in water.
A magnetic adsorbent permits easy recovery of the adsorbent from the treated water by
magnetic force, without the need for further downstream treatment processes. In this research,
a magnetic adsorbent synthesized by covering SiO2 film and anchoring amine group onto
magnetite particles and used to adsorb copper ion in aqueous solution. The experimental
results of isotherm were fitted to the Langmuir adsorption model.

4Abstract: This study evaluated the performance of a system combined with ultraviolet and O3,
denoted as UV/O3, to mineralize dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in an aqueous solution. Although
DMSO itself has low toxicity, the biological treatment of wastewater containing DMSO is known to
be difficult. A concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) was chosen as a mineralization index of
the decomposition of DMSO by the UV/O3 process. The experimental results of this study suggest
that ultraviolet irradiation 37.2 2/ cmmW (254 nm) and O3 dosages of 5.0 × 10–4 mol/min provides
the best condition for the mineralization of DMSO (20 mg/L), resulting in 95% mineralization, at 60
min reaction time. Adding H2O2 into the UV/O3 process will suppress mineralization efficiency.
The addition of chloride ions or ferrous ions to the reaction solution will also suppress the
mineralization efficiency of the UV/O3 process. Variable ionic strength in the reaction solution
shows no effect on the mineralization efficiency of the UV/O3 process.
Keywords: Dimethyl sulfoxide; Mineralization; Ozone; Ultraviolet.
Introduction
The semiconductor industry is an important component of the electronics industry, whose global
market yield has already exceeded that of the automobile industry (Chang and Sze, 1996). The
semiconductor manufacturing process involves a wide variety of distinct unit procedures and is
continually evolving. Although considerable efforts have been made through process modification
or chemical substitution to reduce environmental contamination, a number of the manufacturing
processes still give rise to emissions of a variety of pollutants, include inorganic and organic
solvents.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organic solvent, which is colorless, highly hygroscopic, thermally
and chemically stable, and has strong solvency for both organic and inorganic compounds. The use
of DMSO as a solvent for organic and inorganic compounds in semiconductor manufacturing
processes has been increasing in recent years (Koito et al., 1988; Park et al., 2001). Although
DMSO itself has low toxicity, the biological treatment of wastewater containing DMSO is known to
be difficult. This is because aerobic biological processes cannot achieve an effective level of DMSO
decomposition, and an aerobic biological processes can produce volatile and noxious compounds,
such as (CH3)2S or hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which makes it difficult to control the treatment process
(Koito et al., 1988; Park et al., 2001).
Ozone (O3) is a chemical agent widely used for the mineralization (i.e. transformation into CO2 and
inorganic ions) of herbicides and related bio-recalcitrant organic contaminants in water (Rice and
Browning, 1981; Langlais et al., 1991; Gottschalk et al., 2000). Disadvantages of ozonation alone
(O3 system) for water treatment are the high energy cost required for its generation and very limited
6parameters fixed.

Results and Discussion
Mineralization efficiency of DMSO under various conditions
To confirm the role of O3, UV, and H2O2 in the mineralization reaction of DMSO, six sets of
experiments were performed to compare the mineralization efficiency of DMSO under various
conditions as a function of time, which is given asTOC,DMSO = (TOC0 –TOC)/TOC0, and the results
are shown in Figure 2. Condition (a) denotes a reaction system only with UV 254 nm and the power
density of UV is 37.2 2/ cmmW , and condition (b) represents a reaction system only with O3. The
obtained TOC,DMSO was below 5% after 60 min of reaction time with these two conditions. We also
attempted to mineralize DMSO by H2O2 alone, and the result indicated that H2O2 does not possess
the ability to mineralize DMSO. Condition (c), using H2O2 and O3 (denoted here as H2O2/O3), a
betterTOC,DMSO (approximately 36.4% at t = 60 min) was achieved as compared to the values under
conditions (a) and (b), thereby confirming the strong oxidation ability of H2O2/O3. The oxidation
potential of H2O2/O3 is based on the fact that the conjugate base of H2O2 can catalyze ozone into the
formation of OH (Gottschalk et al., 2000). An optimum dose ratio of H2O2/O3 has often been
shown to be in the molar range of 0.5～1 depending on the presence of promoters and scavengers.
H2O2 itself can act as a scavenger as well as an initiator, and therefore determining the optimum
dose ratio of H2O2/O3 is important (Gottschalk et al., 2000). With the stoichiometric molar ratio of
H2O2/O3 being 0.5, the overall reaction of H2O2 catalyzes O3 to produce OH as shown in Eq. (1).
In this study, the dosage rates of O3 and H2O2 are 5.0 × 10–4 mol /min and 2.5 × 10–4 mol/min,
respectively.
8As a result, the mineralization efficiency of DMSO under various conditions follows the sequence:
UV/O3＞ UV/H2O2 > UV/H2O2/O3 ＞ H2O2/O3＞ O3 ＞UV.

for all cases was 20 mg/L, and without controlling pH values.
Figure 3 presents the variations of TOC and pH of the DMSO solution under the UV/O3 process as
a function of time. As shown in Figure 3, the removal of TOC is close to 94.6% at t = 60 min,
indicating that the UV/O3 process could mineralize DMSO efficiently. Furthermore, the pH value of
the reaction solution without a buffer system decreased considerably from 5.8 to 3.0 during the
entire reaction time, thereby revealing that acid intermediates are formed before DMSO is converted
10
order kinetic hypothesized, Table 1 reveals that the influence of the pH value on the reaction rate is
negligible at pH values in the range of 3.0 to 8.0. It is clear from Eq. (6) that more hydroxyl radicals
were produced at high pH values, thus enhancing the mineralization rate of DMSO. However, the
production of hydroxyl radicals by the UV/O3 process also proceeds according to Eqs. (3) and (4),
and it was not influenced by the pH value of the aqueous solution. The reasons of the pH effect on
the mineralization of DMSO by UV/O3 is negligible for pH values of the solution in the range of 3.0
to 8.0 may be due to the hydroxyl radicals were major produced by Eqs. (3) and (4). Table 1 also
reveals that the mineralization efficiency drop abruptly when pH = 10. Due to the high OH ion
content of the system may trap the mineralization generated CO2 in the solution and, as a result,
bicarbonates and carbonates are formed in the alkaline system. Both bicarbonates and carbonates are
efficient scavengers of hydroxyl radicals due to their very high reaction rate constants with the
hydroxyl radicals (k = 8.5 × 106 M–1 s–1 for bicarbonates and k = 3.9 × 108 M–1 s–1 for carbonates).

Effect of initial concentration of DMSO on the mineralization efficiency of UV/O3
The target compound concentration is an important parameter affecting the mineralization
efficiency in the photocatalytic ozonation reaction; therefore, the effect of the initial DMSO
concentration on the photocatalytic ozonation mineralization rate was investigated over the DMSO
concentration range of 20 to 100 mg/L, and the experimental results are presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4 shows that the mineralization efficiency decreases as the initial DMSO concentration
increases, and that theTOC,DMSO is in the range of 94.6% to 67.8% after 60 min of reaction time.

Ionic strength may affect the effective concentration of a compound in a solution, and this becomes
more significant in the presence of polar compounds (Skoog et al., 2000). As noted, DMSO is a
polar compound, which may be surrounded by ions in solutions, resulting in shielding off oxidizing
agents such as O3 and hydroxyl radicals. Presumably, it decreases the mineralization efficiency of
DMSO by the UV/O3 process. In an experimental study, Sotelo et al. (Sotelo et al., 1989) examined
the effect of ionic strength on the solubility of O3 for various types of inorganic solutions. These
researchers concluded that there is no significant effect on the solubility of O3 in sulfate solutions.
Additionally, sulfates are not oxidized by ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals. In the present
study, attempts have been made to evaluate the effect of ionic strength on the mineralization of
DMSO in sulfate solutions by the UV/O3 process, and the results are shown in Table 3. As can be
seen in the table, the variation of the ionic strength neither facilitates nor suppresses the
mineralization of DMSO. This indicates that, in the UV/O3 process, the inhibition of the
mineralization of polar organic compounds in an aqueous solution is not significant at high ionic
strengths.
