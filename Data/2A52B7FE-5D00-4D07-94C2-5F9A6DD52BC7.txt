This study identifies the critical variables for determining route construction priorities (RCP) 
in a common duct network (CDN) using expert interviews and questionnaire surveys. 
Statistical analysis is also conducted to check the validation and verification of the survey 
results. Furthermore, factor analysis is employed to derive 24 priority determinant variables 
and classify them into five groups, including utility agency, traffic condition, local 
government, infrastructure project, and site condition. The paired comparison method is then 
employed to determine the weightings of the five groups. It is found that the utility agency is 
the most important factor while the site condition is the least important one in determining 
RCP for a CDN. An assessment model for ranking the RCP in a CDN is developed. A 
six-route CDN located in northern Taiwan is analyzed using the proposed model, with 
multiple viewpoints being considered to ensure the objectivity of the analytical results.

The human population is supported by various types of life-lines, including power, 
electricity, water supply, gas, and sewerage all closely link to civilians. Lifelines generally 
have three forms, including underground, ground, and overpass. Traditionally, most city 
lifelines were built either underground or on the ground. To handle the growing demands of 
these lifelines, construction work was regularly required to fix, expand, or maintain these 
existing lines. Many types of construction, such as pipeline maintenance, expansion and 
tearing down, require frequent excavation of roadways and pavements (Beach et al., 2005; 
Huang, 1999). Consequently, the living environments are impacted by the traffic jams, dusts, 
noises, and air pollutions, and the social cost is significantly increased. Building common 
ducts (CDs) to contain various lifelines has been adopted as a new approach to reduce 
construction work and the associated public impact. 
CD, which can be built either above the ground surface or underground contains piping 
and wires for multiple sorts of public utilities, including electricity, water, gas, sewage, 
communication (also for military and police use), oil, gas, CATV (cable television or 
community antenna television), street lighting, traffic signs, and relevant surveillance and 
detection systems (Common duct, 2006). Common duct can improve the living quality of 
cities and villages, integrate public utilities, avoid the need to excavate roadways and thus 
 3 
select container shipping routes. Simulation was conducted to validate the feasibility of the 
model. The research found that shipping capacity and transportation price are main factors 
influencing container route selection, but a change in transportation price of a port pair has a 
little effect on container route selection. 
Based on the above literature, it is concluded that there is hardly any integrated 
assessment of the determination of RCP in a CDN currently and thus the appropriate routes 
may not be selected. Particularly, assessing the weights of route priority determinant variables 
depends upon various natural and human conditions. Various wide-ranging factors are 
complicated and difficult to quantify (Ling, 2005). All the above factors contribute to the 
difficulty of setting the RCP for a CDN. To solve the above problems, this study attempts to 
improve the RCP of a CDN in terms of its decision making value by establishing a practical 
prioritization model that considers factors and issues which government officials must 
consider before making decisions.

A model has been developed for the priority setting process to connect the factors 
identified via a questionnaire survey. Based on agreed criteria among CD professionals, the 
proposed model will reduce the subjectivity that has been a prominent feature of RCP 
decisions in Taiwan. The development of the proposed model comprises four main steps: (1) 
develop a list of nominated priority determinant variables (NPDVs); (2) identify the primary 
priority determinant variables (PDVs) and classify them into priority determinant groups 
(PDGs); (3) assign weights to PDGs and PDVs; and (4) use the proposed model to determine 
the RCP of an actual CDN located in northern Taiwan. Figure 1 displays the scheme of the 
developed model. For the model development, this study conducted a two-stage questionnaire 
survey to gather research data. The sample population includes two groups of professionals 
with sufficient knowledge of CD: (1) authority/design engineers, and (2) 
contractors/pipeline-firm engineers. 
This research proposed an assessment model for setting the RCP in a CDN. The 
procedure of carrying out the RCP is shown in Figure 2. When using the proposed assessment 
model, steps 2-5 should be repeated until all routes have been assessed. 
(1) Collect background information of the routes 
Background information of the routes will assist the assessment team to understand the 
condition of the routes, and thus improve the accuracy of the assessment results. The collected 
information should include width of existing roadway, up-to-date pavement restoration, 
budgeted costs, distribution of budgeted costs, frequency of pavement excavation, number 
and types of pipelines accommodated, and etc.  
(2) Rate IOF 
Each evaluation item in the RCP assessment table is rated in terms of its intensity of 
favorite (IOF) of RCP on a five-point scale (Score of Favorite; SOF) ranging from “5” to “1”. 
A SOF of “5” means “favorable” while “1” means “unfavorable”. 
(3) Calculate SOI 
The concept of SWAM is applied to calculate Score of Item (SOI), where SOI is 
calculated from Eq. (1). 
SOI = SOF*WOI  ….……………………………………….................................……(1) 
Where:  
SOF = Score of Aspect 
WOI = Weight of Item 
(4)Calculate SOA 
Raw Score of Aspect (RSOA) and Score of Aspect (SOA) can be calculated from Eq. (2), 
and Eq. (3), respectively. The weights of aspect, obtained by paired comparison method, are

1. Various complex and interactive variables must be considered when prioritizing CDN route 
construction, and decisions regarding the implementation of such a plan cannot be made by 
any individual or single agency. Consequently, it is highly desirable to develop a systemic 
approach to gather various viewpoints and define the relationship of these viewpoints. 
2. The proposed assessment model includes five aspects (utility agency, infrastructure project, 
traffic condition, local government, and site condition) and 24 evaluation items. Utility 
agency is the most important of the five aspects while construction site condition is the least 
important in terms of prioritizing route construction for a CDN. Notably, this is only a 
localized situation. In other countries, the aspects and evaluation items of prioritizing route 
construction may be completely different and the relative weights of assessment aspects and 
items may also vary. 
3. The proposed model can be applied to prioritize route construction for other CDNs in 
Taiwan, and average scores can be obtained to provide the baseline values for prioritizing 
route construction. 
4. Although the analytical methods used in this study are straightforward, the statistical 
analysis is relatively complicated. A computer-based assessment model can improve the 
effectiveness of model operation. In addition, numerical simulation methods may also to be 
applied to rank RCP in a CDN as well.
