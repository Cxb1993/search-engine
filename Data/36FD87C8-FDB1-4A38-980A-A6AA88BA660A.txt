 
ABSTRACT 
 
Intersystem handover is essential for seamless communication since subscribers move between 
different systems. This paper proposes an efficient GSM/WCDMA intersystem handover decision 
based on user mobility to suppress the ping-pong effect. By using GPS positioning, the proposed 
algorithm adjusts the power threshold associated with distance between the mobile and 
surrounding base stations. The performance was verified by applying the proposed method to an 
existing network in urban Taipei city. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms 
traditional method by decreasing the number of intersystem handover and increasing the data 
throughput.

• Event 1A (Radio Link Addition): Network establishes 
a new connection and adds the base station to active 
set. 
• Event 1B (Radio Link Removal): Network terminates 
the connection and removes the base station from 
active set. 
• Event 1C (Radio Link Replacement): Network 
replaces a base station with another in the active set 
when active set is full. 
Because the variation of signal strength caused by shadow 
fadings is a random process, the RSS from the nearest base 
station may be weaker than that from distant base stations due 
to deep fadings. Therefore, handover decision mechanisms 
based on measurements of signal strength induce the ping-
pong effect. This paper proposes an efficient handover 
decision based on user mobility to suppress unnecessary 
handovers. By using GPS positioning, the proposed algorithm 
adds a confidence parameter associated with distance between 
the mobile and surrounding base stations. 
    Figure 2 illustrates the conventional and proposed 
intersystem handover algorithms. The conventional algorithm 
makes handovers from WCDMA to GSM systems in T1, T2, 
T3 and T4 because the pilot strength of the best candidate base 
station in the active set is below WCDMA_Threshold for a 
period of ∆T. The decision can be expressed as 
 
ThresholdWCDMAM actbest _log10 _ <             (1) 
 
where Mbest_act is the pilot strength of the best candidate base 
station in the active set. Because of the variation of signal 
strength caused by shadow fadings, handover decision 
mechanisms based on (1) will cause many unnecessary 
handovers.

    Therefore, the proposed algorithm uses a more stringent 
criterion for handover decisions by introducing a parameter of 
link robustness, determined from the distance between the 
mobile and surrounding base stations, to adjust 
WCDMA_Threshold to suppress unnecessary handovers. The 
decision can be expressed as 
 
conactbest DThresholdWCDMAM −< _log10 _        (2) 
 
where Dcon is the robustness parameter. When the pilot 
strength of the best candidate base station in the active set is 
below WCDMA_Threshold, the distance between the mobile 
and surrounding base stations is used to access the robustness 
of the communication link. The link robustness is inversely 
proportional to the distance between the mobile station and 
the main serving base station in active set. Therefore, the 
proposed method will increase the difficulty of intersystem 
handover when the mobile station is close to the serving base 
station. Figure 3 show the flowchart of the proposed handover 
algorithm. From Fig. 2, the proposed algorithm makes 
handover in T5 only, reducing unnecessary handovers in T1, 
T2 and T3 compared to the conventional method. 
III. VERIFYING PERFORMANCE USING MEASUREMENT DATA 
The proposed handover algorithm was applied to an existing 
GSM/WCDMA network in urban Taipei city. The 
measurement equipment, “Nemo OutdoorTM” provided by 
NEMO Technologies, was used to conduct the measurements. 
Calls were made from a car, driving along the routes plotted 
in Fig. 4. The triangles in the figure indicate base station sites 
with an averaged cell radius of around 330m. The mean and 
standard deviation of building heights are 20.3m and 14.4m, 
respectively. The mean and standard deviation of base station 
heights are 26.4 m and 10.2 m, respectively. As the 
measurements were being made, the GPS coordinates of the 
mobile station along with the power levels received from 
surrounding base stations in the active set and monitored set 
were recorded. 
    The measurements data were applied for performance 
verification of intersystem handover algorithms. The 
maximum size of active set was set to three, and the distance 
threshold ranges were set from 200m to 500m. GPS 
positioning and location with different errors (modelled as 
Gaussian noise) were taken into account to assess the 
handover performances. Number of handovers and call 
dropping rate, defined as the rate that the received signal from 
serving base station(s) is less than a threshold, are used as 
performance measures. Figure 5 shows the comparison of 
handover numbers. The increasing of distance threshold 
facilitates the raising of the robustness parameter of 
communication link, thus decreases the number of 
intersystem handover. Meanwhile, the probability of 
communication linking with GSM system can be reduced, 
resulting in higher data throughput by using WCDMA 
system, as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 7 shows the comparison of 
call dropping rate, where the proposed method remains 
similar to the conventional method. 
The 17th Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC'06) 
algorithm introduces a link robustness parameter associated 
with distance between the mobile and surrounding base 
stations in Event 3A. The performance was verified by 
applying the proposed method to a GSM/WCDMA network 
in urban Taipei city. The result shows that the proposed 
algorithm improves the intersystem handover number about 
5% to 20% over the conventional one and the rate of data 
communication about 12% to 20%, while the signal outage 
probability remains similar.
