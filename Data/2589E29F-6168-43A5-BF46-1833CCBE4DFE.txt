1. About Old Architecture Rescue Center
1.1 A profile of OARC
Carved beams and painted columns are so beautiful and present exquisitecrafts’ 
aesthetics in every detail in the arts of eastern architecture which is far contrast to the
western. Although traditional arts of architecture still surprise many foreigners, it
stays in an inferior situation and gradually loses its importance under the impact of
modern industry and technology. Therefore, owing to acknowledge the important
task of cultural heritage preservation, Old Architecture Rescue Center (OARC) of
NPUST was established and preserves about one thousand pieces of architectural
elements with exquisite ornaments of old Xinhuei temple constructed in 1926 and
dismantled in 2005 (Fig. 1~3). 3

Old Architecture Rescue Center
In order to transmit the cultural beauty and techniques and to educate next
generations’traditional arts, the center proceeded several projects, such as digital
archive of NSC, international symposiums with workshops on emergency
conservation and exploit added value of digital archives to produce innovative
commodities. The center functions as a university museum as well as a research
center for conservation of historical architecture and a center of innovative design.
In 2008, the left structural frame (Jia-shan) of the central bay of back was
reconstructed in OARC.
1.2 The Purposes of OARC
The purposes of OARC are to preserve and transmit Taiwanese architectural
techniques and arts. Its four main functions are research, conservation, education,
3 Prof. April Hueimin Lu proceeded to rescue and dismantle an old temple, Xinhuei Gong, constructed
in 1926 and conserve in university campus of NPUST in October, 2005 immediately after she was
informed it being to be perished on July 14, 2005. In October of 2007, a hetero-preservation shelter,
called“Old Architecture Rescue Center”was established to preserve those precious dismantled
architectural elements.
exquisite techniques and aesthetics can be presented for public to invoke more
attentions for the beauty of arts crafts and construct a learning environment for arts
and humanities. The integrated function of archive, reconstruction, and education with
exhibition is one of distinguished features of the center.
(4) Creation and Production
From preservation of cultural heritage to creation of innovative cultural
products is a necessary process to promote the beauty and value of those architectural
elements. Some prototypes of innovative commodities are developed, such as 1/4
model, 3d animation of temple reconstruction, carving artifacts, and etc. Those
prototypes of innovative commodities has ever participated international Licensing
EXPO(Fig.4~7).

(http://oarc.npust.edu.tw) (Lu, 2008a; Lu,2010)
This project is to digitally preserve all the structural members decomposed from
an old temple through classification, coding, and digitalization with 2D and 3D
techniques to vividly display to the public. Besides, with convenient interface of

2. Reconstruction in Virtuality
The recording for digital archive of old Xinhuei temple architecture includes three
different scales of digital scanning - whole, object, and detail. They are for interior
study working pattern, predict working time)/collecting data (plan, site, and historical
documents) →working process and design working pattern (set up scanner, set up
spheres, other kinds of scanners’co-operation, it needs three spheres as conjugating
points between two scanning stations) →scanning each sphere to gain relative
position between measuring station and sphere, then calculate the supposed coordinal
point of measuring station→scanning the target (select the window scale, select the
suitable scanning dpi, obtain coordinate points of measuring station and the distance
of each scanning point) →check up screen and judge scanning is complete or not,
check conjugate accuracy is under 1cm( Then, one moves other stations to scan until
all necessary data are colleted) →making the 2D images ortho view of facade, and
sections (Fig. 13-16) → import into cad, those 2D images in the CAD can be drawn
and compensate with more manual measurement or compare previous measuring
drawing.

hall
Fig. 14 Ortho view of 3D scanning–facade of
back hall
Fig. 15 Ortho view of 3D scanning–section of front hall, court, and back hall
Those 3D scanning data of pointscloud are able to be transformed into CAD by
the software of Rapidform XOR by choose the functions of“mesh and surface”to draw
3D digital mode. After having 3D CAD data of the whole temple, it can produce 3D
animation through 3dmax.The 3D animation of temple before its deconstruction is
shown in the website ( http://oarc.npust.edu.tw/Xinhuei/movie.aspx).

The process of scanning: preparation (site, set up instruments, environmental control)
→select the suitable lens and do correction→discuss the measurable strategies
( schedule, direction, and procedure) →proceed measure work to obtain the single
data file of point cloud, and filter data→compare, fit the position, and conjugate
several data files a→integrate the whole conjugation→set up the references grids→64
dimensional working environment for rapid caculating grids→STL real grid print out
→post process
