Abstract
A mathematical model system was developed to describe simultaneous removal of phenol and
chromium (VI) in an anaerobic fixed biofilm reactor. The model system incorporates the
mechanisms of diffusive mass transport and double Monod kinetics. The model was solved
using a combination of orthogonal collocation method and Gear’s method. A laboratory-scale
column reactor was conducted to verify the model system. Batch kinetic tests were conducted
independently to determine the biokinetic parameters used in the model system. The removal
efficiencies for phenol and Chromium (VI) were approximately 98% and 91%, respectively, at a
steady-state condition. The experimental results are in agreement with model simulations. The
experimental and model approaches presented in this study could be used to design pilot-scale or
full-scale anaerobic fixed-biofilm reactor to remove phenol and chromium (VI) simultaneously in
industrial wastewater.
Keywords: Phenol degradation; chromium reduction, biofilm reactor, model system
molecular diffusion. These assumptions are essentially the same as those made by Suidan and
Wang [7]. The model system including substrates balance in the biofilm and in the reactor can
be summarized in the following equations

4. Materials and methods
Phenol-utilizing cells
The phenol-utilizing bacteria were inoculated with digester sludge from a sewage treatment
plant (Taichung, Taiwan) and was maintained in the laboratory for more than two years on a
The second part of the phenol curve ran from 1 day to 24 days, when the curves started to
deviate from the top of dilute-in curve. The effluent phenol concentration leveled off and then
decreased. Apparently, biofilm was vigorously utilizing phenol during this period of time.
Biofilm was also actively growing during this period.
The third part of phenol concentration curve ran from 24 days to 200 days. At this period,
the system reached a steady-state condition and the effluents of phenol and was about 8.4 mg/L
(0.0167 Sbp0). The removal efficiency for phenol was 98%. As can be seen, the experimental
data are slightly lower than simulation result for the effluent of phenol at this period.
The Fig. 2(b) shows that the Cr(VI) varied with time. As can be seen, the Cr(VI) curve first
increased to 2.3 mg/L (0.46 Sbc0) at 1 day. Second, the curve went down during the period of 32
days. The E. coli biofilm vigorously utilizing Cr(VI) during this period of time. The Cr(VI)
reduction reached a steady-state condition from 32 days to 200 days. The removal efficiency of
Cr(VI) was about 91% at a steady-state condition. At this period, E. coli biofilm and suspended
biomass reached a steady-state value, which were 350 μm and 85 mg cell/L, respectively.
To verify phenol degradation with Cr(VI) reduction in the anaerobic biofilm reactor, the Cr(III)
production was observed in this experiment. The Cr (III) production from Cr(VI) reduction is
shown in Fig. 2(c). It shows that E. coli effectively reduced Cr(VI) to produce Cr(III). The Cr
(III) production increased with time from 0 to 16 days during the transient period of time. The
Cr (III) curve reached a steady-state condition after 16 days. At a steady-state, the Cr(III)
production was about 1.9 mg/L (0.38 Sbc0).
6. Conclusion
In this study, the kinetic biofilm model for phenol degradation and Cr(VI) reduction was
developed and verified by conducting a laboratory-scale anaerobic fixed biofilm reactor. The
biofilm reactor was capable of achieving high simultaneous removal of phenol and Cr(VI) when
phenol and Cr(VI) was subjected to the feed concentration of 500 mg phenol/L and 5 mg
Cr(VI)/L, respectively.  A combination of orthogonal colocation method and Gear’s methodwas
most suitable to solve the anaerobic biofilm model. The model was able to predict the reactor
performance from a non-steady-state to steady-state condition. The approaches applied in this
study could be expand to design a pilot-scale or full-scale biofilm reactor to remove phenolic
organics and chromium (VI) in the industrial wastewater.
