Abstract 
This study cooperated the KOH anisotropic etching with the laser machining to fabricate small 
sonic nozzles in the shape of a pyramidal convergent inlet followed by a conical diffuser with a 
divergent angle of 5o.  Three different diffuser lengths were made for the nozzles.  The throat 
diameters were around 100 µm.  Experiments were performed to obtain discharge coefficients 
and critical back pressure ratios in Reynolds numbers ranging from 5.8×102 to 4.5×103.  The 
critical back pressure ratio for one of the nozzle type examined reached 0.486 at Re = 4.4×103.  
Numerical simulations were also implemented to discover the flow fields at an upstream pressure 
of 203 kPa.  The simulation results revealed that, besides flow separation, the first set of oblique 
shocks appeared in the nozzle jet could lead to tremendous pressure loss.  The weaker of the 
oblique shocks, the higher the critical back pressure ratio would be obtained.

1. Introduction 
Small sonic nozzles, that is, throat diameter smaller than 200 µm, are found more and more in the 
measurement of gas flow.  However, due to the small size, the geometries are quite difficult made 
to conform to the toroidal or cylindrical configuration in ISO 9300 [1], nor is the surface 
roughness.  The fabrication techniques for small sonic nozzles may differ from conventional 
machining and the employed technique usually determines the achieved nozzle shape.  The 
nozzles with shapes deviating from the ISO configurations and Reynolds numbers smaller than 
2.1×104 must be calibrated before applying to flow measurement.  Bignell [2] examined several 
  3
a sonic nozzle.  As mentioned above, the achieved convergent section would be like a pyramidal 
concave, resulting in a half angle of 35.3°.  From [9], the etching condition of this study would 
lead to a surface roughness less than 40 nm.  After the pyramidal concave being made, the laser 
machining was used to drill a cylindrical tube to penetrate the silicon wafer along the center line 
of the pyramidal concave.  Then, the diffuser with a divergent angle of 5° was carved step by step.  
The surface roughness by the laser machining employed was about 5 µm, high enough to cause 
non-negligible disturbances to some micro channel flows.  However, in this study, the flow 
separation or viscous boundary layer in the conical divergent might alleviate this roughness effect.  
Figure 3a shows the SEM (Scanning electron microscope) picture of the nozzle inlet or 
convergent section, and Fig. 3b is the exit of the conical diffuser.  In the figure, the throat 
diameter, d, is about 113 µm. 
 
The thickness of the silicon wafer employed was 525 µm.  In other words, this is the length of the 
silicon nozzle.  Figure 4 shows the sagittal views of the nozzles examined in this study.  The 
nominal dimensions labeled in the figure are corresponding to the throat diameter of 100 µm.  
However, due to the fabrication uncertainty, the actual sizes obtained differ more or less from the 
nominal dimensions.  The first one, called the A-L1 nozzle, bears a KOH-etched pyramidal inlet 
and a laser-drilled cylindrical tube as outlet.  The nominal length of the cylindrical tube is 39 µm, 
but it can not be measured.  Its diameter, however, is estimated about 96 µm by SEM.  As for the 
A-L2 nozzle, the pyramidal convergent section is followed by a cylindrical tube with a length of 
about 30 µm, and then a short conical diffuser with a length of about 37 µm and a divergent angle 
of 5°.  The throat diameter, actually the diameter of the cylindrical tube, is about 82 µm, 
estimated by SEM.  The third one, called the A-L3 nozzle, comprises a pyramidal convergent 
section, a cylinder tube (throat position), and a longer conical diffuser.  The diffuser length of the 
A-L3 nozzle is 3.7d, about 9 times of the A-L2 nozzle’s, which is expected to save more pressure 
recovery among the three nozzle types.  The throat diameter of the A-L3 nozzle is measured 
about 113 µm, see also in Fig. 3.  The last, called the B nozzle, has already been investigated in [7, 
8].  Its convergent and divergent sections are both pyramidal.  The side length of the nozzle throat 
is 94 µm.  Its results are shown here to be compared with the other three nozzles made in this 
study.

Maintaining the choked condition is crucial while measuring the flow rate by a sonic nozzle.  The 
ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure is often utilized to monitor if the nozzle is 
properly choked.  When the pressure ratio is higher than a critical value, usually called the critical 
back pressure ratio (CBPR), the sonic nozzle will lose its choked condition.  For the CBPR in this 
study, a given upstream pressure, Pu, was set, and the downstream pressure, Pb, would start at a 
very low value, i.e. Pb/Pu smaller than 0.025, to obtain a reference Cd, saying Cd0.  Pu and Pb 
were measured in the flow conduit at 1D (D = 14 mm) upstream and 1D downstream of the 
nozzle [8].  After that, the downstream pressure was increased gradually to obtain the other Cdi at 
different pressure conditions.  As known, the Cdi deviates gradually from the Cd0 as the 
downstream pressure increasing.  ∆Cd% is defined as follows to describe this deviation.

Figure 7 gives the results of ∆Cd% for Pu around 300 kPa.  The symbols employed are the same 
as those in Fig. 6.  For the A-L3 nozzle, the deviation can be neglected as Pb/Pu smaller than 0.4.  
After that, the ∆Cd% decays gradually.  As it reaches -0.1%, the pressure ratio is defined as the 
CBPR [3, 7, 8], signifying the unchoked condition.  With this definition, the CBPR for the A-L3 
nozzle is 0.486 at Pu = 300 kPa or Re = 4.4×103.  They are 0.304, 0.366, and 0.362 for the A-L1, 
A-L2, and B nozzles, respectively.  The results are consistent to our expectation.  The A-L3 
nozzle with the longest diffuser and a divergent angle of 5o leads to the largest CBPR, implying 
the least pressure loss.  The A-L1 nozzle without any diffuser performs the poorest. 
 
Likewise, the CBPRs for the nozzles at the other Reynolds numbers are found and shown in Fig. 
8.  For the A-L1 and A-L2 nozzles, the CBPRs are insensitive to Re.  The average values are 
0.308 and 0.367, respectively.  For the A-L3 nozzle, the CBPR increases from 0.452 to 0.486 
with Re.  Averagely speaking, the CBPR of the A-L3 nozzle is improved by 32% compared with 
the B nozzle [7, 8].  On the other hand, the CBPRs for the A-L2 and B nozzles are comparable.  
The A-L1 nozzle, as mentioned above, has the poorest.  In [3], the CBPR for the quadrant nozzle

The jet flows for the A-L1 to A-L3 nozzles are more confined in the core region and persist a 
longer distance in the downstream, compared with that of the B nozzle. Unlike the A-L1 to A-L3, 
the type B nozzle doesn’t have a straight tube at the throat position to restrict the flow to the 
streamwise direction. Instead, the sharp-edged throat and the large divergent angle (35.3°) result in 
a low-speed separation region between the high speed core and the diffuser wall [8]. The 
recirculation zone in the downstream tube is also seen broader than those of the A-L1 to A-L3. 
 
Figure 11a gives the Mach number variations along the centerlines of those planes in Fig. 10. 
Figure 11b shows the corresponding total pressure, Pt.  The expansion fans and oblique shocks, 
appeared in Fig. 10, cause the Mach number in Fig. 11a to increase and decrease alternatively.  For 
the A-L1 nozzle shown by the square symbol, the flow reaches the sonic condition at x/d = 5.21, 
quite near the throat exit.  The flow then suffers an abrupt expansion to reach a highest Mach 
number among the four nozzles.  For the A-L2 nozzle shown by the circular symbol, the sonic 
condition occurs at x/d = 4.93, about 0.05d behind the throat exit.  The flow of the A-L2 nozzle 
also keeps accelerating after the throat.  However, the short diffuser alleviates the expansion of 
the flow.  The Mach number variation is smaller than that of the A-L1 nozzle, signifying a 
weaker structure of expansion fans and oblique shocks.
