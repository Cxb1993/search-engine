ABSTRACT  
Soluble copolymers of trimethyl (4-(N-maleimido) phenoxy) silane (TMMS) with 
styrene-series monomers were synthesized by radical polymerization in toluene at 70oC using 2, 
2’-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. The comonomer reactivity ratios were calculated by 
the conventional Fineman-Ross and Kelen-Tüdos methods and a nonlinear least-squares 
Tidwell-Mortimer method. The glass transition temperatures (Tgs) and thermal degradation of 
copolymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric 
analysis (TGA) methods, respectively. The comonomer reactiviy ratio of TMMS with styrene 
was changed from a alternating to middle type between alternating and ideal copolymerization 
for the side-chain of TMMS and the deactivators of styrene. The curves of Tgs versus the 
different compositions of the above synthesized styrene-maleimide copolymers matched the 
modified Johnston’s equation as increasing the affect of weight ratio on alternating-segment, and 
exhibited an S-shaped curve of deviation in comparison with the Fox’s equation. The 
maleimide-segments and styrene-segments within these copolymers were completely compatible 
and the thermal stability and flame retardancy of polystyrene could be enhanced simultaneously 
via the introduction of silicon-containing maleimide.

INTRODUCTION 
Maleimide polymers have good thermal stability with high glass transition temperature (Tg) 
due to their polar five membered imide ring structure. The functional polymaleimides made from 
various functionalized maleimide monomers also provide some desirable properties. N-aryl 
maleimide (AM) monomers, such as N-phenyl maleimide (PM), N-hydroxyphenyl maleimide 
(HPM) and halide-substituted N-hydroxy- phenyl maleimide (XHPM), were usually 
copolymerized with ethylene or propylene series monomers to promote their heat and fire 
resistance. Many researches about the AM copolymers, such as the copolymers with styrene,1-4 
methyl methacrylate,5-7 acrylonitrile8 or vinyl acetate,9 have been reported.  
These copolymers synthesized by introducing the rigid and high thermal stability of AM 
segment own the higher softening points (or Tg) and good fire resistance. Comparing the double 
bonds of AM and styrene comonomers with poor-electron and rich-electron density, respectively, 
a nearby complete alternating copolymer can be formed by free radical copolymerization. The 
copolymerization behavior of truly alternating styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer has already 
been reported by many researches.10-13 But, the silicon-containing AM systems are still rarely

Scheme 1. Synthesis of silicon-containing St-MI copolymer 
    Basic properties of St-MI copolymers in different silicon contents and molecular weights 
obtained from elemental analysis and GPC analysis are given in Table I. The average number 
molecular weights ( Mn ) of each copolymer series were approximately in the range 
5.2~9.5×104(g/mole). The Mn  gradually decreased, while the polydispersity index (PDI= 
MnMw ) increased along with the increasing maleimide monomers in feed. This might due to 
that the silicon-containing maleimide monomer could easily cause the chain transfer during 
copolymerization reaction. Besides, the copolymerization degree and average molecular weight 
might be affected by the side-chain effect and steric hinderance generated from maleimide and 
styrene segments. The sequence of intermolecular steric hinderance should be B-St >A-St >C-St 
>St. Since B-St series copolymers would form a larger steric hinderance during copolymerization, 
a lower polymerization degree and a lower average molecular weight would be obtained. 
    The reactivity ratios of styrene/TMMS comonomers, as shown in Table II, were determined 
by the method of Fineman-Ross,28 Kelen-Tüdos,29 and Tidwell-Mortimer30 while all the 
instantaneous copolymer yield were under 10%. All the reactivity ratio for the above 
copolymerization is no longer nearby zero but changed to 0.48-0.88, and is larger than that of the 
general St-MI copolymerization.10-13 This was mainly due to the electron- withdrawing effect of 
silane side chains to inhibit the carbonyl pairs withdrawing electron effect of double bond within 
maleimide. Besides, the polarity of styrenes was also affected by their deactivators. The result of 
the reducing reversed polaritiy of double bond of TMMS relative to that of styrenes indicated that 
the above comonomers reaction had changed from a alternating to middle type between 
alternating and ideal copolymerization. As shown in Table I, all the 4 copolymerization systems, 
furthermore, exhibit azeotropic points (for example the system of B-St at about F1=f1=0.75) that 
represent a composition where polymerization proceeds to relatively high conversion with no 
change in either feed ratio or copolymer composition.  
As shown in Table II, the reactivity orders of TMMS-terminated radical towards the 4 series 
of styrene monomers was St >C-St >A-St >B-St, indicating that these copolymerizations were 
also affected by the properties of different side chains within styrene monomers. Since the 
copolymers, the Johnston’s equation33 modified from Fox theory was applied : 
where Pij: probability of forming ij-segment, Tgii: homopolymer’s Tg of comonomer i, and Tgij: 
glass transition temperature of alternating segment within copolymer. The Pij could be calculated 
as: 
 
It could also be noticed in Figures 1-4 that the Johnston’s curves of copolymers did not match the 
actual Tg curves. That means the effect of its Tg12 on the real Tg of copolymer cannot be 
sufficiently described by Johnston’s equation. Considering the influence of Tg12 that should be 
more significant, a modified Johnston’s equation can be taken as following 34 : 
where α is a parameter according to the effect of alternating segment. Substitution of actual Tg of 
all the 4 series copolymers into the equation (3) gave an average of Tg12 so as to obtain the 
modified Tg-W2 curves. The value α was determined by a try-and-error method so as to make the 
modified Tg-W2 curves approaching to the actual Tg as possible as it can be. It could also be 
noticed from Figures 2-5 that the actual Tg of all the 4 series of copolymers were proved to match 
our modified curves while α=1.24 in St, α=1.14 in A-St, α=1.10 in B-St, and α=1.22 in C-St 
series. That means the Tg of these copolymers could be sufficiently described by our modified 
equation as a result of increasing the affect of weight ratio on Tg12. Besides, the S-shaped curve of 
deviation is more not obvious as the difference of Tg between comonomers is small like B-St 
system.  
 
CONCLUSION 
The radical copolymerizations of 4 styrene-series with silicon- containing maleimide were 
carried out to get some novel copolymers. The factors, such as steric hinderance and chain 
transfer caused by silicon-containing maleimide, could affect the molecular weight, 
polydispersity index and segments distribution of copolymer. The actual Tgs’ curves versus the 
composition ratios for all the above copolymers were very consistent with the modified 
Johnston’s eqution as increasing the weight ratio of alternate segments. The maleimide-segments 
and styrene-segments within these copolymers were completely compatible and the thermal 
stability and flame retardancy of polystyrene could be enhanced simultaneously via the 
introduction of silicon-containing maleimide.
