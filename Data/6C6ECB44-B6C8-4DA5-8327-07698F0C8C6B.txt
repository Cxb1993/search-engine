• Subject 2. Performance analysis of cooperative localization: The major 
challenge in the aforementioned location-based SNSs is the precision of user 
location. In general, the precision of localization using GSM base stations could 
be around 100 meters while using GPS varies between 20 and 30 meters. Assume 
user 1 left a message at the coffee shop as shown in Figure II-1 below. 
 
Due to imperfect localization, the information embedded in the message contains 
the coordinates of point A. If user 2 finds himself at a music store, he may later on 
receive the message (left at the location that is R meter away from point A) since the 
SNS may mistakenly conclude that user 2 is at point A, again due to imperfect 
localization. In other words, the example shows the maximum error could be up to 
twice of the precision of the localization technique, or 60 meters in the case of GPS. 
In urban environments, our experiments suggest that the error could be easily up to 
several hundreds of meters or more.

研究目的 
 
• Subject 1.Program development: 
 
     This is the start point of our research development. We propose a system 
model iballoon that supply the following new services: 
 
1. Space Capsule: 
 iballoon allows a user leave a digital footprint in a place. The footprint 
includes text message, a picture or an audio message. The space capsule is 
hidden in the air of the place that it was made. Once another user passes 
through that place he can watch that footprint. Figure I-1 shows the main idea 
of space capsule. 
2. Data Collection: 
 iballoon is the system we collect real users data that can be used for 
digging into the relation between physical location and human social network. 
How does the information at a specific place spread? Does the information 
spread according to the relationship between people?  
3. User privacy protection: 
 iballoon service would notify users when there is space capsule near 
them. In addition, only a user who goes to the place that you left your space 
capsule can “open” it and watch what you left. This approach prevents 
continuously tracing where you are as Loopt [2]. For example (in Figure I-1), 
Rachael took a picture and left a text (So beautiful) at September 21 only users 
 5 
services will bump into localization problems. For example, Foursquare enforces 
users to take a picture in front of a store otherwise they cannot receive reword the 
store offers. 
 
研究方法 
 
• Subject1.Program development: We build a system, iballoon on android 
platform where is open and adaptive to many mobile devices. In the first version of 
our system, iballoon not only collect data but also push messages that were leaved 
by others to you. With those data we can achieve the three researchable issues 
aforementioned. Users use iballoon to send a balloon (as a space capsule we 
mentioned above). This balloon contains text, pictures and voice. In addition, this 
balloon either stays at the place it was created or moves at a random speed and 
random direction. Users who create this balloon has the right to decide to let the 
balloon stay at where it is created or let it float over the air. All of the users only 
can see the contents of a message within two hundred meters on map. When a 
message floats close enough to a user, for instance five hundred meters the 
application will remind the user. In other words, as soon as a message floats to a 
region centered upon a user, the application pops up a reminder to remind users.  
 
• Subject2. Performance analysis of cooperative localization: We consider two 
users, A and B, in the vicinity of each other. It is assumed that user i ∈ {𝐴,𝐵}  
acquires its 2-dimensional geographical coordinates, Gi, via its GPS receiver. The 
precision of user i's GPS receiver is assumed to be Ri meters. Under these 
assumptions, the actual position of user i, Pi, can be modeled as a random variable 
that is uniformly distributed in a circle centered at Gi with a radius of Ri. Denote 𝑃𝚤� 
as an estimator of user i's actual coordinates Pi. It is easy to show that 𝑃𝚤� = 𝐺𝑖 is 
the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator of Pi. User i should use 𝑃𝚤� = 𝐺𝑖 
as its coordinates in the location-based SNS if no other location information is 
available. 
 Now assume that users A and B obtain their distance, r, via short-range radios 
such as Bluetooth, ZigBee or ultra-wide band (UWB). In general, 𝑟 ≠ 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵������� since 
neither GPS nor the short-range radio is perfect. In our solution, we assume that r 
is much more accurate than 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵������� given that some short-range radios (e.g., UWB) 
can achieve a precision of less than 1 meter. To simplify our analysis below, we 
further assume that r is the actual distance between users A and B, and they utilize 
this information to find the new MMSE estimators of PA and PB. 
Figure II-2 illustrates a scenario where users A and B obtain their coordinates 
from the GPS and their distance 𝑟 ≪ 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������. The circles, CA and CB, represent the 
possible locations of users A and B, respectively, when only the GPS information 
is available. If the distance information r is also provided, the locations of users A 
and B can only in the shadowed areas shown in the figure. For example, user B can 
only be in the overlap of circles CA’ and CB, where CA’ is also centered at GA but 
with a radius of 𝑅𝐴 + 𝑟.

Fig. II-3. Equal probability density at any point 
of arc lx,B 
Fig. II-4. illustration 
 
Instead of deriving the marginal pdf of 𝑃𝐵 directly via 𝑙𝑥,𝐴 and 𝑙𝑥,𝐵, lets first 
consider the estimator 𝑃𝐵� for 𝑃𝐵. 𝑃𝐵� is said to be the MMSE estimator of 𝑃𝐵 if and 
only if 
                        (3) 
is minimized. If we analogize the probability density p(𝑝𝐵) in Eq. (3) to the mass 
density of the shadowed area (i.e., the overlap of 𝐶𝐵  and 𝐶𝐴′ ) at point 𝑝𝐵 , the 
MMSE estimator 𝑃𝐵� becomes the center of mass (CoM) of that area. Thus, we will 
obtain 𝑃𝐵�  by calculating the CoM of the shadowed area made by 𝐶𝐵  and 𝐶𝐴′  in 
Figure II-3. 
It has been shown that any point on arc 𝑙𝑥,𝐵 has the same probability density, 
which is proportional to the length of arc 𝑙𝑥,𝐴. Note that such an arc is inside the 
overlap of circles 𝐶𝐵 and 𝐶𝐴′ , and can be uniquely defined by its distance to circle 
𝐶𝐴, |𝑥|. If the arc is inside circle 𝐶𝐴 (e.g., lx2,B and 𝑙𝑥3,𝐵 in Figure II-5), x has a 
negative value. Otherwise, x is positive (e.g., 𝑙𝑥1,𝐵). Given that all such arcs must 
be inside both 𝐶𝐴′  and 𝐶𝐵 , we have −𝑑0 = −[𝑅𝐴 + 𝑅𝐵 − 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������] < 𝑥 <
𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟,𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵������� + 𝑅𝐵 − 𝑅𝐴). For any given x, the CoM of arc 𝑙𝑥,𝐵 is obtained as 
𝐶𝑜𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐,𝑋(𝑥) =  (𝑅𝐴 + 𝑥) ∙ 𝑠𝑖𝑛 �φ2� ∙ 2φ     (4a) 
𝐶𝑜𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐,𝑌(𝑦)  =  0        (4b) 
where 𝐶𝑜𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐,𝑋 and 𝐶𝑜𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐,𝑌  represent the x-axis and y-axis coordinates of arc 
𝑙𝑥,𝐵's CoM, respectively, and φ is obtained by Eq. (2b).

Fig. II-7. Adjustment of interval of  
integration in Eq. (5a) 
Fig. II-8. A special case: 𝑟 ≫ 𝑅𝐴 and 𝑟 ≫ 𝑇𝐵 
 
Finally, we consider a special case shown in Figure II-8 where 𝑟 ≫ 𝑅𝐴 and 
𝑟 ≫ 𝑅𝐵. In this case, the shadowed area is no longer oval-shaped since the points 
that are in 𝐶𝐵 and closer to 𝐶𝐴 cannot find a corresponding point in 𝐶𝐴 such that 
𝑃𝐴𝑃𝐵������ = 𝑟. In this case, the interval of integration in Eq. (5a) should be adjusted to 
as [𝑟 − 2 ∙ 𝑅𝐴,𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟,𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵������� + 𝑅𝐵 − 𝑅𝐴)]  to correctly calculate the CoM of the 
shadowed area. 
 
C. Simulation 
   In our derivation above, we claimed that if 𝑃𝐴,𝑖 and 𝑃𝐵,𝑖 are legitimate locations 
of users A and B, p(𝑃𝐴 = 𝑃𝐴,𝑖,𝑃𝐵 = 𝑃𝐵,𝑖)  =  p(𝑃𝐴 = 𝑃𝐴,𝑗,𝑃𝐵 = 𝑃𝐵,𝑗) for all i ≠ j. 
In what follows, we conduct some simulations to verify this claim. 
The values of RA, RB, r and 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵������� used in our simulations are listed in Table 
II-1. We consider three scenarios including 𝑅𝐴 = 𝑅𝐵, 𝑅𝐴 < 𝑅𝐵, and 𝑅𝐴 > 𝑅𝐵. In 
each scenario, circles CA and CB may be disjoint (if 𝑅𝐴 + 𝑅𝐵 <  𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������), just touch 
(if 𝑅𝐴 + 𝑅𝐵 = 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������) or intersect (if 𝑅𝐴 + 𝑅𝐵 > 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������) with each other. For each 
given 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������, we also consider the cases of 𝑟 < 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������, 𝑟 = 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������, and 𝑟 > 𝐺𝐴𝐺𝐵�������. In 
total, there are 18 cases considered in our simulation. 
In each case, we first calculate the areas where users A and B can possibly be 
located. These two areas, denoted as 𝐸𝐴 and 𝐸𝐵, are the shadowed areas shown in 
Figure II-2. 𝐸𝐴 is the overlap of circles 𝐶𝐴 and 𝐶𝐵′  while 𝐸𝐵 is the overlap of circles 
𝐶𝐵 and 𝐶𝐴′ . Two points, 𝑝𝐴 from EA and  𝑝𝐵 from EB, are then independently and 
randomly chosen each time. If 𝑝𝐴𝑝𝐵������� = 𝑟 , these two points are the legitimate 
locations of users A and B, and the corresponding coordinates are recorded. 
Otherwise, the coordinates are discarded. 
Since there are infinite points in EA and EB and we cannot store all these 
points in our simulation, only the points in EA and EB with integer-values 
coordinates will be selected and considered. The procedure is repeated for 400000 
times and the number of occurrence, 𝑁𝑝𝐴𝑝𝐵 , for each legitimate pair (𝑝𝐴,𝑝𝐵) is 
recorded. Finally, we take the average of all 𝑁𝑝𝐴𝑝𝐵 's in each case and calculate 
their standard deviation. The results are also shown in Table II-1. The result that 
the standard deviation is much smaller than the average ─ especially when we have 
sufficient data points (i.e., the average is large) ─ shows that 𝑁𝑝𝐴𝑝𝐵 for different

We build the system iballoon which is useful to collect different kinds of 
information. In the second year of the project, we will continue to improve this 
platform. For example, we make an effort to add video messages. In addition, we 
should take power consumption and GPS accuracy into consideration that are big 
issues in mobile devices. 
 
• Subject2. Performance analysis of cooperative localization: In this subject, a 
new cooperative localization scheme is proposed to improve the accuracy of user 
location information. The scheme requires users in vicinity to estimate the 
distance between them and at the same time obtain geo-coordinates from GPS or 
cellular networks. The information is then exchanged between users so that more 
precise geo-coordinates can be calculated. We develop a mathematical model to 
find the MMSE estimator of user location and conduct in-depth simulation. The 
results show that our MMSE location estimator improves the accuracy, compared 
to relying on GPS only, by up to 50% and provides location precision that is 
needed for wireless and mobile SNS.

2nately, user profiles (especially personal interests or
attention) could vary with the time of the day. For
example, getting restaurant recommendation from the
colleagues when you are really hungry (e.g., lunch
break) is valuable but the same information can simply
be filtered out if it is received after a big meal.
• Forged characteristics: Due to lack of physical in-
teraction, people are easier to incarnate as someone
they prefers to be, instead of who they really are.
For example, Mary may claim that she loves pets
even though she never has any experience with pets
or stepping into any pet store. This is referred to as
forged characterisitcs. Forged characteristic is different
from faked identity (e.g., identity thieves) since a user
may reveal his/her true identity (e.g., Mary) when
forging his/her characteristics. With the disguise via
online SNS, forged characteristics are much harder to
be identified.
The above issues, if not addressed properly, could impede
further development of online SNS. In this paper, we try
to address these issues with the help of recent advances in
wireless communications. Wireless communication has one
unique feature — mobility — that cannot be matched by
its wired counterpart. The support for mobility not only
enables ubiquitous access to online SNS, but more im-
portantly, provide user locality information. This additional
information, if used properly,2 has potentials to prevent SNS
users from suffering the aforementioned physical interaction,
information overload and forged characteristics.
For example, a US-based online service called Loopt
enables users to trace the locations of their friends based
on cellphone-based GPS. By doing so, friends using Loopt3
can meet with each other if they are in vicinity of each
other. Google Latitude also provides a similar service. In
November 2009, MIT also launches a “friend spotting”
service called iFIND4 based on their campus WiFi network
(composed of more than 3000 access points). MIT students
can trace the locations of their classmates in real time and
increase the chances of casual encounters. A proximity-
based introduction application based on Bluetooth, called
Serendipity, is also developed by MIT to help conference
participants to know each other more easily (as an ice
breaker). These new online SNSs, with the help of local-
ity information, increase physical interaction or encounters
among SNS users.
Moreover, applications such as Foursquare allow users to
leave private or public messages at certain points of interests.
The message may be retrieved later by the user themselves or
their friends when they return to those locations. Foursquare
and other applications such Placepop or Gowalla also allow
users to check-in at specific points of interests, thus leaving
their digital “footprints” at those locations. The location-

Fig. 1. Maximum localization errors in mobile SNSl
aware messages and footprints can potentially alleviate in-
formation overload or forged characteristics. For example,
providing dinning experience or recommended dishes of a
restaurant to a user when he/she is near the restaurant avoids
unnecessary real-time updates. Take Mary who forges her
characteristics as another example. It is also more difficult
for Mary to claim her love for perts if she never leaves any
digital footprint in pet stores or related events.
A major challenge in location-based SNSs is the precision
requirement for user location. In general, the precision of lo-
calization using GSM base stations is around 100 (or more)
meters while the precision achieved by GPS varies between
20 and 50 meters. Assume user 1 left a message at the coffee
shop as shown in Figure 1. Due to imperfect localization, the
location information embedded in the message may contain
the coordinates of point A, not the coffee shop. If later
on user 2 finds himself at a music store that is R meters
away from point A, he is able to retrieve the message left
at the coffee shop by user 1 since the SNS may mistakenly
conclude that user 2 is at point A, again due to imperfect
localization. The example shows that the information can
be retrieved at locations that are twice of the maximum
localization error away, or 100 meters in the case of GPS.
Our filed tests suggest that such localization errors usually
result in unpleasant user experience in location-based SNS.
In view of this problem, we propose a user-level cooper-
ative localization scheme. Our scheme is developed based
on the fact that existing handheld devices are generally
equipped with a GPS receiver and short-range radios such as
Bluetooth. These new embedded hardwares allow users to
obtain geo-coordinates from the infrastructure (e.g., GPS or
cellular networks), and estimate the distance between users
in vicinity. With exchange of these information, new and
more accurate coordinates can be obtained and used by the
location-based SNSs. It is noted that there exist many so-
called cooperative localization solutions in wireless sensor
networks. The majority of the existing work focuses on the
relative position among devices (e.g., robots or vehicles)
without support from infrastructure [5], [8], [9], [10], [11].
Our “cooperative” localization, however, utilizes the infras-
tructure localization support (e.g., GPS) with cooperation
from each other.

Instead of deriving the marginal pdf of PB directly via lx,A
and lx,B, lets first consider the estimator PˆB for PB. PˆB is said
to be the MMSE estimator of PB if and only ifZZ

is minimized. If we analogize the probability density p(pB)
in Eq. (3) to the mass density of the shadowed area (i.e.,
the overlap of CB and C′A) at point pB, the MMSE estimator
PˆB becomes the center of mass (CoM) of that area. Thus,
we will obtain PˆB by calculating the CoM of the shadowed
area made by CB and C′A in Figure 2.
It has been shown that any point on arc lx,B has the same
probability density, which is proportional to the length of arc
lx,A. Note that such an arc is inside the overlap of circles
CB and C′A, and can be uniquely defined by its distance to
circle CA, |x|. If the arc is inside circle CA (e.g., lx2,B and
lx3,B in Figure 5), x has a negative value. Otherwise, x is
positive (e.g., lx1,B). Given that all such arcs must be inside
both C′A and CB, we have −d0 =−[RA+RB−GAGB]< x <
min(r,GAGB +RB−RA). For any given x, the CoM of arc
lx,B is obtained as

Fig. 5. CoM of the shadow area: weighted sum of CoM of arcs lx,B
where CoMarc,X and CoMarc,Y represent the x-axis and y-
axis coordinates of arc lx,B’s CoM, respectively, and φ is
obtained by Eq. (2b).5
Finally, the CoM of the shadowed area can be computed
by the weighted “sum” over the CoM of all arcs lx,B where
−d0 < x < min(r,GAGB+RB−RA). The weight is the mass
of each arc and is proportional to lx,A · lx,B. Therefore, the
CoM of the shadowed area, or equivalently the MMSE
estimator PˆB, is obtained as
PˆB,X =
R min(r,GAGB+RB−RA)

B. Generalization
In the above derivation, we assume that d0 < r. Therefore,
θ given by Eq. (2a) is always less than pi. In the case of
d0 ≥ r, arc lx,A becomes a circle with a radius of r, as shown
in Figure 6, if x≤−r. For such x’s, lx,A in Eq. (5a) should
be replaced by 2pi · r. If −do < x < −[RA− (RB−GAGB)],
arc lx,B also becomes a circle — with a radius of RA + x
— as also shown in Figure 6. For such x’s, lx,B in Eq. (5a)
should be replaced by 2pi ·(RA+x). The CoM of such circles
is located at GA and thus, CoMarc,X in Eq. (4a) becomes 0.
In the case of d0 > RA, circle lx0,B (i.e., x = −RA)
degenerates to a single point GA as shown in Figure 7. One
can observe from the figure that the union of all arcs lx,B
for −[RA − (RB −GAGB)] ≤ x < r and all circles lx,B for
−RA ≤ x ≤ −[RA − (RB −GAGB)] has covered the entire
shadowed area formed by circles CB and C′A. Therefore,
the left endpoint of integration interval in Eq. (5a) should
be replaced by −RA instead of −d0 in order to correctly
calculate the CoM of the shadowed area.
5Note that x = 0 in all figures of this paper is used as a reference point
to calculate lx,A and lx,B and should not be considered as the origin of
Cartesian coordinate system, namely GA, when calculating the CoM.

different scenarios are given in Table III. Note that in the
case where only GPS is used, EM =RB. Therefore, only EM’s
for the cooperative scheme are presented. The results show
that our scheme could reduce the maximum error by up to
70%, when comparing with the the original non-sooperative
scheme.

In this paper, a new cooperative localization scheme is
proposed to improve the accuracy of user location infor-

coordinates from GPS or cellular networks. The information
is then exchanged between users so that more precise geo-
coordinates can be calculated. We develop a mathematical
model to find the MMSE estimator of user location and
conduct in-depth simulation. The results show that our
MMSE location estimator improves the accuracy, compared
to relying on GPS only, by up to 70% and provides location
precision that is needed for wireless and mobile SNS.
