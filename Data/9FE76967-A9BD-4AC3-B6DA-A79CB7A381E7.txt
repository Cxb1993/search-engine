三、 緣由與目的  
  SiGe quantum wells (QWs)1,2 and 
quantum dots (QDs)3,4 have drawn much 
attention in the applications of nanoelectronics 
and optoelectronics. The three- dimensional, a 
growth mode (Stranski-Krastanov, SK) is 
well-known to dominate the Ge epitaxial growth 
on Si 5,6. A few monolayer of Si directly grown 
on Ge has been reported to passivate Ge 
channels of metal-oxide-semiconductor field 
effect transistor (MOSFET) 7, 8. A doped epi-Si 
layer was reported to eliminate Fermi level 
pinning and to reduce the contact resistivity 9. 
However, there are limited reports on the growth 
mode of Si on Ge. The dot growth of 
4~20-monolayer Si on Ge (001) by molecular 
beam epitaxy (MBE) was studied over a wide 
range of growth temperatures. Under tensile 
strain, the Si dots with SK growth mode were 
analyzed 10. However, the further growth can 
lead to Ge segregation on the surface. The Ge 
segregation has been found in MBE and 
ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition 
(UHV/CVD) system due to the hydrogen 
desorption from the surface 11 and it can happen 
even at the temperature lower than 300oC 12. 
The open sites created by the Ge segregation on 
the Si surface are responsible for the growth 
mode transition from the traditional 
three-dimensional mode. The growth mode 
transition of Si on Ge is observed by the atomic 
force microscopy (AFM) and the cross-sectional 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  
二、 研究方法與結果 
All the samples were grown by the UHV/CVD 
system at 550oC. The base pressure was ~10-9 
torr. Pure silane (SiH4) at a fixed 100 sccm flow 
was used for Si growth. The Si is directly grown 
on Ge without the buffer layer. The Si dots 
grown at 550oC are shown in Fig. 1(a) with the 
dot density of ~ 7 ×108 cm-2 and the surface 
root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ~1.2 nm. 
The much lower density as compared to the Ge 
dots on Si (~1010 cm-2) probably due to the 
impedance of three-dimensional dot growth by 
the tensile strain 13, 14. The aspect ratios with the 
standard deviation at ~ 0.02 of Si dots on Ge are 
from ~ 0.05 to ~ 0.1, which are smaller than the 
Ge dots on Si (0.13-0.17) 14. The cross sectional 
TEM image of the Si dot with the aspect ratio of 
~ 0.05 is shown in Fig, 1(b). The wetting layer 
of the Si dots is ~5 nm, which is thicker than 
that of the Ge dot on Si (~1 nm). The thicker 
wetting layer of Si dots on Ge was also report in 
the ref.10. The observed thicker wetting is 
probably due to the tensile strain 13. It is evident 
that the SK mode growth is still valid for the 
tensile strained Si growth on Ge (001) 10 .

The evolution of strain in Si on Ge, which is 
determined by the lateral lattice constant, was 
analyzed by the in-plan x-ray diffraction (XRD) 
using synchrotron radiation source. The XRD 
in-plane radial scans across Si (400) and Ge 
(400) peaks for the samples with Si dots and 15 
nm Si on Ge are shown in Fig.5. The decrease of 
lateral lattice parameter, as revealed by the 
positive shift of ~ 0.5o from the Si dot sample to

grown on Ge. Note the surface roughness 
(~0.26 nm) is similar to bulk Ge. (b) The 
cross-sectional TEM images with Ge content 
by EDS measurement. 
After ~15 nm growth of Si on Ge (Fig.4 (b)), 
neither Si dots nor rings-like structures were 
observed on the surface (Fig. 4(a)). The surface 
RMS roughness is only about ~0.26 nm, which 
is similar to the bulk Ge substrate (~0.25 nm). 
From the EDS measurement (Fig. 4(b)), the Ge 
content is ~47% near the bottom of “Si film” 
and gradually decreases to ~2% near the top. 
With the assistance of the enhanced growth rate 
at the initial Si wetting layer, the transition from 
three-dimensional to two-dimensional growth 
mode was observed for Si growth on Ge. For 
even thicker Si, less Ge content near the top is 
expected. Note that there have some dislocations 
found to relax strain (Fig.4 (b)).  
Fig. 5 The (400) XRD in-plane radial scans 
of Si dots and 15 nm Si on Ge. Note the 
tensile strain is almost relaxed for 15 nm Si 
on Ge. 
to the 15 nm Si film sample, is attributed to 
the lateral tensile strain relaxation. Note that 
the Si dots have the lateral tensile strain of ~ 
0.34%. With the increasing Si thickness, the 
strain relaxation becomes significant. The 
15 nm Si on Ge is almost relaxed. The 
dislocation in the 15 nm Si film (Fig.4 (b)) 
is responsible for the tensile strain 
relaxation.
