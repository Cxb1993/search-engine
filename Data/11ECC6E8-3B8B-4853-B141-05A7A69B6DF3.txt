Abstract 
 
We study the fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) 
which mask on the erbium doped fiber 
amplifier (EDFA) to reduce noise and flatten 
the signal gain of a 
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) 
system. The unequalized signal power due to 
the four-wave mixing and Raman crosstalk 
can be compensated in the WDM 
transmission system. The proposed modules 
will be also experimentally demonstrated to 
verify the theoretic results. 
The FBGs with different center 
frequencies can be placed at different 
positions of the EDFA to reflect the signals 
from different channels. By designing the 
placed position of each FBG in the EDFA, 
signals from different channels can attain 
equal gain in the backward direction with 
increasing the power conversion efficiency. 
By adjusting the reflectivity of FBGs 
corresponding to different input power levels, 
the dynamic gain-equalization can be realized 
in the WDM system. To reflect the different 
channel signals at different position, the 
flattening gain spectrum of an erbium-doped 
fiber amplifier by using the fiber-Bragg 
gratings with different center frequencies is 
attained. The designed gain excursion less 
than 0.2 dB can be achieved for 16 channel 
multiplexed signals with 0.2 mW input 
power in the 1534-1564 nm wavelength 
region.

schemes based on a lasing mechanism are 
simple and effective ways to overcome this 
problem and achieve constant gain 
characteristics regardless of input power 
variations. All-optical feedback techniques 
applying a ring laser with tunable band-pass 
filter or laser cavity with FBGs have been 
proposed to stabilize the gain of a fiber 
amplifier [7,8]. However, there are no studies 
on ring lasing mechanisms in Raman/EDF 
hybrid amplifiers for WDM systems. 
Therefore, this paper proposes an all-optical 
gain-clamped Raman/EDFA hybrid amplifier 
scheme that reflects amplified spontaneous 
emission (ASE) into the hybrid amplifier 
using FBG and a circulator at the output end. 
This is the first experimental demonstration 
of broad band gain-clamped and gain 
flattened dispersion-compensated 
Raman/EDF hybrid amplifiers that recycle 
the residual Raman pump power with only a 
single FBG for WDM systems. The optimum 
gain clamped wavelength was 1564 nm. A 
gain variation of less than 0.21 dB can be 
achieved from 1525 to 1625 nm, and the 
dynamic input power exceeds 18 dB, ranging 
from -20 to -2 dBm. Further, a gain ripple of 
less than ±1.75 dB can be achieved from 
1530 to 1595 nm. 
 
四、研究方法 
 
The schematic diagram of a WDM 
transmission system with amplifier spacing 
50 km is shown in Fig. 1. Computer 
simulation is used to determine the signal 
output power and noise spectrum for an 
EDFA. Without the FBG, Fig.2 shows the 
optical spectra of 16 channel WDM signals 
and ASEN after the 40 m Al co-doped EDFA. 
The 16 channel WDM signals are allocated 
from 1532 to 1562 nm, the channel spacing is 
2 nm. The average signal gain is 20.4 dB 
with -10 dBm input signal power for each 
channel. There is 4.5 dB maximum 
inter-channel power difference at the output 
of EDFA (the minimum power 6.08 mW at 
1542 nm, the maximum power 16.98 mW at 
1560 nm). The gain unbalance can be 
flattened by the FBGs written at the different 
position of EDFA. Each FBG is designed to 
be centered at assigned frequencies with the 
bandwidth 0.6 nm. The each individual FBG 
position should be designed so that they have 
a maximum average gain over the 16 channel 
signal and optimum gain flatness for the 
given input signal power level. The optimum 
written position of each FBG along the 
EDFA for gain equalization is shown in 
Fig.3a. For the FBG with 1532 nm center 
frequency, the optimum written position is 
39.9 m and thus the longest amplifying 
distance for 1532 nm signal is 79.8 m. For 
the FBG with 1562 nm center frequency, the 
optimum written position is 28.8 m and thus 
the shortest amplifying distance for 1562 
signal is 57.6 m. By using the set of FBGs 
shown in Fig.3a, Fig.3b shows the flat signal 
amplification with the same condition shown 
in Fig.2. The average signal gain is 20.4 dB 
and the gain excursion is less than 0.1 dB for 
16 channel multiplexed signals. The energy 
conversion efficiency of EDFA with the FBG 
is equal to those of EDFA without the FBG. 
The signal to noise ratio of each channel is 
above 35 dB. By using the long period fiber 
grating as equalization filter at z = 20 and 40 
m, the output spectrum of 16 channel signals 
with 0.1 mW input signal power is shown in 
Fig.4, the gain excursion are about 0.87 and 
0.8 dB, the average signal gains are 19.5 and 
17.6 dB, respectively. The energy conversion 
efficiencies of EDFA with the long period 
fiber grating are lower then those of EDFA 
with the FBG, because the long period fiber 
grating acts as a wavelength-dependent 
attenuator, especially when it is placed at the 
output of the EDFA. 
For -20 dBm input signal power, Fig.5a 
shows the optimum positions of the FBGs 
with optical bandwidth 0.6 nm, Fig.5b shows 
the equalized output power spectrum of 16 
channel signals after EDFA with the FBG as 
shown in Fig.5a. There are 30.2 dB averaged 
signal gain and 0.15 dB gain excursion for 16 
channel WDM signals. The signal to noise 
ratio of every channel is above 30 dB, about 
5 dB lower than those of the -10 dBm input 
signal power. The optimum written positions 
are different from the -10 dBm case. 
However, The optimum position can be 
calculated for any other EDFAs by taking 
 6
shorter than 1575 nm. For an input signal 
power of -20 dBm, the clamping powers in 
the ring cavity are about 11.43, 8.17, and 
8.51 dBm when the clamping wavelength are 
1550, 1564, and 1575 nm, respectively. The 
clamping power can control the gain clamped 
level and the gain clamped range, but the 
latter mainly relates to the selected clamping 
wavelength. Figure 3 shows that the optimum 
gain-clamping wavelength is 1564 nm for a 
broad band gain-clamped and gain flattened 
dispersion-compensated Raman/EDF hybrid 
amplifier. 
 
六、計畫成果自評 
 
This project has been performed 
thoroughly. The results are outstanding in the 
respects of dispersion compensation 
EDFA/Raman amplifiers. We presents a 
dispersion-compensated Raman/EDF hybrid 
amplifier that recycles the residual Raman 
pump power for wavelength-division 
multiplexing (WDM) systems. This is the 
first experimental demonstration of a broad 
band gain-clamped and gain flattened 
dispersion-compensated Raman/EDF hybrid 
amplifier that recycles residual Raman pump 
power using a single fiber Bragg grating for 
WDM systems. The optimum gain clamped 
wavelength was 1564 nm. A gain variation of 
less than 0.21 dB can be achieved from 1525 
to 1625 nm, and the dynamic input power 
exceeds 18 dB, ranging from -20 to -2 dBm. 
Further, a gain ripple of less than ±1.75 dB 
can be achieved from 1530 to 1595 nm.
