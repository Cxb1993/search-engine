Abstract 
In this report, it summarizes most of the experimental results of the three year project. 
Organic fluorescent dyes doped in silica solid matrix show different fluorescence behavior 
from those dissolved in water, anhydrous alcohol and silica sol/gel.  Preliminary 
experimental results show that fluorescence intensity is dramatically increased and emission 
wavelength shifts toward shorter wavelength side (blue shift) after the fluorescence dye been 
immobilized in a silica matrix. In the experiment, an organic fluorescence dye has been 
successfully encaged into silica matrix via sol-gel technique.  The encaged organic dye have 
been confirmed to be more photo-chemically stable and less self-concentration-quench, 
compared to that dissolved in solvents such as water and alcohol.  The goal of current project 
is to investigate the mechanism of such phenomena as well as to find answers for the 
following five questions: (i) what is the difference in fluorescence emission bandwidth, gain 
and life-time after the dye doped in the silica gel, (ii)what is the effect of temperature on the 
behavior of organic fluorescence dye entrapped in the silica matrix.  Knowledge and 
techniques developed from the project will be of help to those who try to develop hybrid 
polymeric (organic/inorganic) materials, especially for applications in organic light-emitted 
diode (OLED), dye lasers, fiber optic chemical sensors, and plasma display.   
Current experimental results also show a certain progress: (i) the photoluminescence 
efficiency of the organic dye (thionine) has been promoted 800%, compared to that dissolved 
in water, and (ii) a machining-able dye-doped silica plate has been prepared via hybrid sol-gel 
synthesis and the sample can be cut and polishing to fit the criteria of solid-state dye lasers.
