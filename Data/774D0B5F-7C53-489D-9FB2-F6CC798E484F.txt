af = flow on arc a; f= [ af ] =vector of all arc flows; note that hf ∆= .

c(f)=[ca(f)]=vector of arc cost function. 
G=[ abg ]=the arc cost Jacobian matrix; note it is positive definite. 
Gˆ =the new arc cost Jacobian matrix after adding a new path connecting an origin-destination pair. 
cp(h)=cost on path p as a function of all path flows. 
c(h)=[cp(h)]=vector of path cost functions; note that c (h)= )( fcT∆ and a change in c(h) denotes )( ′hc . 
Uw=cost associated with origin-destination pair w and a change in U denotesU ′ . And, according to

2. Dafermos and Nagureny’s model 
 
Consider a network N, given the travel demand, and the case of affine cost function. Assume that the 
flow on each path of the network N, including the new route, is positive before and after the route 
addition. Now we add a new path r which connects the origin-destination pair w1, through some 
manipulation, we get the following model:

. Therefore,  
we can apply Cramer’s rule to get [ ]U ′− ,and realize whether Braess’s paradox occur. 
        rank ( T][ Λ∆ )= n  if T][ Λ∆  is a m×n matrix.      (4) 
 
3. The modified model 
 
Before we present our modified model, we briefly introduce the main definition and theorems of 
generalized inverse matrix. The theorems are proven in Graybill(1970), and they are not listed below. 
Let A be an m x n matrix. If a matrix denoted by −A exists that satisfies the four conditions below, it 
will be defined as a generalized inverse of A. 
 
Definition 3.1 
(i) −AA  is symmetric. (ii) AA−  is symmetric.  (iii) AAAA =− . （iv） −−− = AAAA . 
For each matrix A there exists a unique matrix −A satisfying Definition 3.1. 
Theorem 3.1: If A is an m x n matrix of rank m, then 1)( −− = TT AAAA  and A A− = I . 
Theorem 3.2: Let the system of equation Ax=g have a solution, where A is m×n matrix. For each n×1 
vector k, the vector x0 is a solution, where
