Production of High-Content Fructooligosaccharides by Immobilized 
Aspergillus japonicus and Pichia heimii 
 
Abstract 
 
An immobilized two-cell system consisting of Aspergillus japonicus and Pichia heimii 
was used for the production of high-content fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from sucrose. In 
this dual-cell system, sucrose was converted into FOS and glucose through the catalytic 
reaction by the intracellular fructosyltransferase (FTase) of A. japonicus. Glucose, the side-
product, was concurrently consumed by the yeast P. heimii to form ethanol, glycerol, acetic 
acid and lactic acid. After removing glucose, FOS content reached more than 95% on a dry 
weight basis. In order to continuously produce high-content FOS, a tanks-in-series system 
consisting of three stir tanks was employed. The first two tanks contain immobilized A. 
japonicus and P. heimii, where sucrose was converted into high-content FOS. In the third 
tank the residual monosaccharide was eliminated by the immobilized P. heimii. Substrate 
composed of 30%(w/v) sucrose and 0.1%(w/v) yeast extract was fed into the bioreactor at a 
dilution rate of 0.1 per hour. The reaction was carried out at pH 5.5 and 30°C. The pH of the 
reaction mixture was controlled by automatic addition of NaOH solution. With this tanks-in-
series system, the content of FOS can be further enriched to 97% on a dry weight basis. One 
gram of sucrose yielded 0.62 gram of FOS. This immobilized dual-cell system can effectively 
work for several weeks, if 1 g/L of yeast extract were daily added to each reaction tank to 
sustain life of the microbial cells.

1. Introduction 
FOS is one of important prebiotics, which can stimulate the proliferation of bifidobactria 
in intestine and thus improve human health. FOS is a collective name for 1-kestose (GF2), 
nystose (GF3) and fructosyl nystose (GF4). Generally, FOS is produced through the catalytic 
reaction of furctosyltransferase, using sucrose as substrate. The final product consists of 50-
60% FOS, 30-40% glucose and 10-20% unreacted sucrose. Glucose is a byproduct of the 
reaction and is also a competitive inhibitor for the fructosyl-transferring reaction. If during 
the reaction glucose can be consumed by means enzyme catalysis or microbial fermentation,

mixed thoroughly with equal volume of 4% sodium alginate solution. Through a plastic tip, 
the mixture was dropped into 1% CaCl2 solution using a peristaltic pump.  After 2 h of 
stirring, the formed calcium alginate beads were preserved at 4°C in a solution containing 2% 
glucose, 0.1% YE and 1% CaCl2. These pal-yellow beads of immobilized P. heimii were used 
in the further experiments. 
Continuous production of high-content FOS by the immobilized two-cell system: A tanks-in-
series bioreactor (figure 1) consisting of 3 tanks was used in this work. Every tank had a 
working volume of 3 L. Each of the first two tanks contained 1200 g (wet wt.) of 
immobilized P. heimii and immobilized A. japonicus having ~3000 units of FTase. One unit 
of FTase was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produced one micromole of 1-
kestose in the initial state at pH 5.5 and 30°C, using 50% (w/v) sucrose as substrate. Specific 
FTase activity of the immobilized A. japonicus was around 30 units per gram (wet wt.). 
 
The third tank contained 1200 g of immobilized P. heimii alone. The continuous reaction was 
initialized with batch reactions. Every 900 g of sucrose was mixed with the immobilized cells 
in the first two tanks. Then water was added to reach a volume of 3 L. The reaction was

Table 2 compared the sugar composition of the FOS product from different research. A 
membrane reactor containing A. japonicus and Gluconobacter oxydans had been employed 
for a continuous production of high-content FOS from sucrose, wherein the byproduct 
glucose was converted into calcium gluconate precipitate [4]. This reaction needed large 
amount of oxygen for the oxidation of glucose. Mass transfer of oxygen in water is rather low 
due to small solubility of oxygen from air in water and therefore only 87% on a dry weight 
basis of FOS was obtained. A two-step reaction catalyzed by β-fructofuranosidase and then 
by free cells of Pichia pastoris had been used for the production of high-purity FOS [5]. The 
byproduct glucose was converted mainly into glycerol. The FOS account for 93.8% (by mass) 
of total sugar in the product.  
In the tanks-in-series reactor with the immobilized A. japonicus and P. heimii as described in 
this work, the byproduct glucose was converted mainly into ethanol. Ethanol, a biofuel, can 
be recovered by mean of distillation. Concentrations of ethanol and other metabolites such as 
glycerol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were shown in table 3. Because ethanol and the organic 
acids inhibited the probably contaminated microorganisms from the surroundings, an aseptic 
process was not required for this reaction. However the feeding solution composed of 30% 
sucrose and 0.1% YE should be autoclaved previously.
