the TPVD approach to design the tri-way 
differencing scheme. Also, to reduce the 
distortion of stego-image quality brought from 
setting larger embedding capacity, an optimal 
approach of selecting the reference point and 
adaptive rules are presented. This can 
maintain the stego-image still at an acceptable 
quality. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 reviews the PVD method. In Section 
3, the proposed construction scheme is 
presented. Experimental results are illustrated 
and discussed in Section 4, prior to 
Conclusions in Section 5. 
 
2. Review of the PVD Method 
 
In the original PVD method [8], a gray-valued 
cover image is partitioned into 
non-overlapping blocks composed with two 
consecutive pixels, ip  and 1ip + . From each 
block, a difference value id  can be calculated 
by subtracting ip  from 1ip + . The set of all 
difference values ought to range from 255−  
to 255 . Therefore, id  ranges from 0 to 255. 
Thus, the block with a small value id  
locates in the smooth area, whereas a block 
with a large value id  is considered as a 
block with sharp edges. According to the 
properties of human vision, eyes can tolerate 
more changes in sharp-edge blocks than in 
smooth blocks. That is, more data can be 
embedded into the edge areas than into 
smooth areas. Therefore, in the PVD method, 
the first step is to design a range table with n  
contiguous ranges ( kR  where 1,2, ,k n= K ) 
and the table range is from 0 to 255. The 
lower and upper boundary of kR  are denoted 
by kl  and ku , respectively, then [ ],k k kR l u∈ . 
The width kw  of kR  is calculated by 
1k k kw u l= − +  and kw  decides how many bits 
can be hidden in two consecutive pixels. Since 
kR  is designed as a variable, the original 
range table is required to extract the 
embedded secret data. Based on the 
consideration of security, the range table is 
designed by selecting the set of { }8,8,16,32,64,128kw ∈  for the experiments. 
For the original PVD method [8], the secret 
data is assumed to be a long-bit stream and the 
cover image is a gray-level image. The 
embedding algorithm is described as follows: 
1) Calculate the difference value id  between 
two consecutive pixels ip  and 1ip +  for 
each block in the cover image. The value 
is given by  1i i id p p+= − . 
2) Using id  to locate a suitable kR  in the 
designed range table, that is to compute 
min( )k ikj u d= −  where k iu d≥  for all 1 k n≤ ≤ . Then jR  is the located range. 
3) Compute the amount of secret data bits t  
that can be embedded in each pair of two 
consecutive pixels by jR . The value t  
can be estimated from the width jw  of 
jR , this can be defined by 2log jt w⎢ ⎥= ⎣ ⎦ . 
4) Read t  bits from the binary secret data 
and transform the bit sequence into a 
decimal value b . For instance, if 
bit sequence 110= , then the converted value 
6b = . 
5) Calculate the new difference value id ′  
given by ,  if 0i j id l b d′ = + ≥ or 
( ),  if 0i j id l b d′ = − + <  to replace the original 
difference id . 
6) Modify the values of ip  and 1ip +  by the 
following formula:

where i im d d′= − . Until now, to embed the 
secret data into the pixel pair 1( , )i ip p +′ ′  is done 
by changing the values of ip  and 1ip + . 
Repeat Step 1-6 until all secret data are 
embedded into the cover image, then the 
stego-image is obtained. For instance, assume 
100ip = , 1 126ip + = , [ ]3 16,31R =  and binary 
secret data is 1101. So 26,id = 3 16,w = 13,b =  
16 13 29,id ′ = + =  3m = , / 2 2,m =⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥ / 2 1.m =⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦  
Since 1 iip p+ ≥  and ,i id d′ ≥  100 2 98ip′ = − =  
and 1 126 1 127ip +′ = + =  are computed. 
Therefore, after changing the pixel pair of 
(100,126)  into the new value of (98,127) , this 
4-bit binary secret data 1101 is embedded into 
the cover image. 
During the phase of secret extraction, the 
original designed range table is required. In 
the beginning, the same method in the 
embedding phase is used to partition the 
stego-image into pixel pairs (blocks). Then the 
difference value ˆid  for each pair of two 
consecutive pixels ˆ ip  and 1ˆ ip +  in the 
stego-image is calculated. Next, ˆid  is used 
to locate the suitable jR  in Step 2 during the 
embedding phase. Therefore, bˆ  is obtained 
by subtracting jl  from ˆ .id  If the 
stego-image is not altered, bˆ  is equal to b . 
Finally, bˆ  is transformed from a decimal 
value into a binary sequence with t  bits, 
where 2log jt w⎢ ⎥= ⎣ ⎦ . 
 
3. The Proposed Method 
 
2) If all im  have the same sign and only one 
{0,1, 1}im ∈ − , then the optimal pixel pair 
optimali  is selected from the other two pairs 
with the smallest m . For example, if 
{4,3,1}, {0,1,2}im i= ∈ , then 1optimali = . 
3) If only one im  has a different sign from 
the other two pairs, the optimal pixel pair 
optimali  is selected from the other two pairs 
with the smallest m . For example, if 
{7, 4,3}, {0,1, 2}im i= − ∈ , then 2optimali = . 
4) If only one {0,1, 1}im ∈ −  and the other two 
im  has different signs, the optimal pixel 
pair optimali  is the pair with {0,1, 1}.im ∈ −  
For example, if {0, 4, 2}, {0,1, 2}im i= − ∈ , 
then 0optimali = . 
5) If there exists more than one pair with 
{0,1, 1}im ∈ − , the optimal pixel pair optimali  
can be selected as any one pair with 
{0,1, 1}.im ∈ − For example, if {4,0,0}im = , 
{0,1,2}i∈ then 1 or 2optimali = . 
By following those selection rules described 
above, we can skip the calculation steps of 
MSE estimation to obtain the optimal 
reference pairs. Thus, the total computational 
complexity can be greatly reduced. 
 
3.4. Adaptive Rules to Reduce Distortion 
 
Although the proposed approach is feasible 
for embedding secret data, embedding large 
amount of bits can still cause serious image 
distortion easily. Since most distortion is 
generated from the offsetting process, the 
following two conditions are further designed 
to avoid too much offset described by 
1) 0_ ( ) 5embedding bit P ≥  and 
1_ ( ) 4embedding bit P ≥  
2) 0_ ( ) 5embedding bit P <  and 
2_ ( ) 6embedding bit P ≥  
where _ ( )iembedding bit P  represents the 
total embedding bits along the direction of iP . 
If either one of above two conditions is 
satisfied, the current block being processed 
can probably result in higher distortion. Then 
we use two pixel pairs, 0P   and 
3 ( , 1) ( 1, 1)( , )x y x yP p p+ + += , and adopt the original 
PVD method to individually process those two 
pairs along one direction. Here, we name 
those two conditions as “ branch 
conditions＂. 
 
3.5. Theoretical Estimation 
 
Suppose that mint  is the minimum amount of 
embedded bits, and minit t≥ . By considering 
the patterns and directional edges of a 2 2×  
pixel block, as shown in Table 1, each block 
has 2 patterns for the smooth area and 14 
patterns for the edge area. There are 2 patterns 
for the vertical edges, 2 patterns for the 
horizontal edges, and 10 patterns for two 
kinds of diagonal edges, respectively. To 
compare the capacity performance achieved 
by the PVD method and our approach, one 
sample block is adopted using block it t= ∑  to 
analyze the capacity as shown in Table 1.  
As shown in Table 1, our approach can 
achieve better performance than the PVD 
method in capacity, only the pattern in the first 
case of bottom-left diagonal is an exception. 
Since one-pixel-wide edges have less chance 
to appear than the smooth areas for natural 
images, the image degradation resulted by this 
case can be neglected. In fact, using our 
proposed branch conditions can also decrease 
the appearance of one-pixel-wide edges. 
Although it is uncertain that the patterns 
fulfilling designed branch conditions are all 
one-pixel-wide edge patterns, branch 
conditions still play an important role at 
balancing between a larger capacity on 2 2×  
pixel blocks and the reduction of image 
distortion.

difference values calculated from four pairs 
are 26, 15, 7, and -8, respectively. After using 
their absolute values to locate suitable ,k iR  
from the designed range table separately, we 
can obtain that 2,0 [16,31],R =  1,1 [8,15],R =  
0,2 [0,7],R =  and 1,3 [8,15]R = . That is, we can 
compute that 2,0 16,w =  1,1 8,w =  0,2 8,w =  and 
1,3 8w = . The amount of bits can be embedded 
into each of four pairs are 0 4t = , 1 3t = , 2 3t = , 
and 3 3t = , respectively. By considering the 
branch conditions in this block, pixel pair 3P  
is discarded. Suppose that the binary secret 
data to be embedded is 11010101001101. 
Therefore, the individual binary bit streams of  
,  i {0,1,2}iP ∈  are 1101, 010, and 100. The 
corresponding decimal values of those bit 
streams are 13, 2, and 4, respectively. By 
following the definition of ,i j i id l b′ = + , the new 
difference values of those three pairs are 
computed as 0 16 13 29d ′ = + = , 1 8 2 10d ′ = + = , 
and 2 0 4 4d ′ = + = , respectively. Based on Step 
7, we can obtain the new gray values of three 
pixel pairs, where 0 (98,127)P ′ = , 1 (103,113)P′ = , 
and 2 (102,106)P ′ = . Then 0 3m = , 1 5m = − , and 
2 3m = −  can be computed. Furthermore, since 
this situation satisfies rule 3 of the optimal 
selection approach for the reference point, the 
optimal reference pair is 2. Based on 2( , )x yp′  
of 2P ′ , the pixel values in another two pixel 
pairs are offset, until ( , )i x yp′  is equal to 2,( , )x yp′ . 
Now, the embedded block is obtained and 
given by (102,131,112,106) . 
3.7. The Extraction Algorithm 
To retrieve the embedded secret data from the 
stego-image, the extraction algorithm is 
described in the following steps. 
1) Partition the stego-image into 2 2×  pixel 
blocks, and the partition order is the same 
as that in the embedding stage. 
2) Calculate the difference values ,( , )ˆi x yd  
separately for each block in the 
stego-image given by 
0,( , ) ( 1, ) ( , )

3) ,( , )ˆi x yd  is used to locate the suitable ,k iR  
as introduced in Step 2 of the embedding 
phase. At the same time, the amount of 
embedding bits it  , where 2 ,logi j it w⎢ ⎥= ⎣ ⎦  
is obtained. If it  satisfies the branch 
conditions, two independent pixel pairs are 
selected; otherwise, three pixel pairs are 
used for further processing. 
After ,k iR  is located, ,j il  is subtracted from 
the selected ,( , )ˆi x yd  and iˆb  is obtained. If the 
stego-image is not altered, iˆb  is equal to ib . 
Finally, iˆb  is converted from a decimal value 
into a binary sequence with it  bits where 
2 ,logi j it w⎢ ⎥= ⎣ ⎦ . Note that the it -bit stream is 
only one part of the secret data before 
embedding. 
4. Experimental Results 
To demonstrate the accomplished performance 
of our proposed approach in capacity and 
security for hiding secret data in the 
stego-image, apart from the results of 
theoretical estimation listed in Table 1, we 
have also conducted different experiments 
using four images to compare the proposed 
approach with the PVD method. According to 
the invisibility benchmark for the 
watermarked images [11], a minimum peak 
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of 38 dB is 
adopted as the quality requirement for the 
stego-images in the experiments. 
4.1. Capacity and PSNR 
The secret binary data sequence S  is 
generated by pseudo-random numbers. We set 
the designed range table with the width in the 
set of { }8,8,16,32,64,128kw ∈ . The size of all 
cover images is 512 512× . Here, PSNR value 
is utilized to evaluate the invisibility of the 
stego-images. Some examples of the cover 
image and its stego-image are shown in Fig. 3. 
To compare the proposed approach with the 
PVD method, Table 2 lists the experimental 
results after the secret data is embedded using 
those two approaches. The hiding capacity (in 
bytes) and PSNR values achieved by the 
proposed scheme and the PVD method for 
four images are shown. The listed values are 
the average results after embedding 100 
randomly generated bit-sequences into the 
cover images. From Table 2, the accomplished 
capacity ratio of our method to the PVD 
approach is near 1.5 in average. Although the 
PSNR value is smaller than 38 for both 
schemes after embedding the data into the 
Baboon image, two stego-images are still 
hardly observed that the secret data is hidden 
inside. This is because of the high variance 
existed in the pixel values of the Baboon 
image. Therefore, this demonstrates that the 
proposed approach can provide a promising 
performance in increasing the capacity of the 
stego-images and maintaining the 
imperceptible quality simultaneously. 
From the root x  whose absolute value is 
the smaller one of the quadratic equation, 
predictive secret message length P  can be 
estimated by /( 1/ 2)P x x= − , where the value 
range of P  is 0~100%. If 0P ≤ , it means no 
embedded message exists in the image. 
Based on the above scheme, the estimation 
results for the message length of various 
images using our proposed method with 
constant secret message capacity are shown in 
Table 3. Although the estimation of message 
length for the Peppers image shows that tiny 
percent of secret message is embedded in the 
image, the value is affected by the initial bias 
locating in the range of standard deviation of 
inaccuracy. Based on the experimental results 
described above, it is proved that our proposed 
method can avoid the detection of 
stego-images and survive from dual statistics 
stego-analysis. 
5. Conclusions 
 
In this paper, we have proposed a 
steganographic method to embed the secret 
data into still images by using tri-way 
pixel-value differencing. Using three different 
directional edges can hide more secret data 
into the cover image than the PVD method. 
Also, we have presented an optimal selection 
approach for the reference point with adaptive 
rules to reduce the quality distortion of the 
stego-image. Experiment results demonstrate 
that the secret data embedded in the 
stego-image is imperceptible for human vision 
while compared with the cover image.  
Furthermore, the proposed approach can 
achieve superior embedding capacity than the 
PVD method, not only from theoretical 
estimation, but also from the experimental 
results. After the detection test for the 
embedded data by the proposed approach, the 
approach demonstrates the robustness to avoid 
the data detection and survive from dual 
statistical stego-analysis. Also, the extraction 
of the embedded secret data can work 
correctly from stego-images without the 
participation of original cover images. This 
shows multiple merits of the proposed 
technique for data hiding.

information and to provide a stego-image imperceptible for  
human vision, a novel steganographic approach based on 
tri-way pixel-value differencing (TPVD) is presented in this 
paper. This approach uses three different directional edges 
effectively to design the tri-way differencing scheme and to 
remove the capacity limitation of the original PVD method using 
only one direction. In addition, we propose an optimal selection 
approach for the reference point and adaptive rules to reduce 
distortion brought from setting larger embedding capacity. The 
theoretical estimation and experimental results demonstrate 
that our scheme can provide a superior embedding capacity. 
Besides, the embedded confidential information can be 
extracted from stego-images without the assistance of original 
images. 
I. INTRODUCTION
OWADAYS, due to a dense development of the modern 
technology of computer and communication, message 
transmission is rapid and convenient. To protect secret 
message from being stolen during transmission, there are two 
ways to solve this problem in general. One is encryption, 
which refers to the process of encoding secret information in 
such a way that only the right person with a right key can 
decode it successfully. Although encryption makes the 
message illegible, its appearance is easy to attract 
eavesdroppers. Another way is steganography, a technique 
which hides secret information into a cover media or carrier 
so that it becomes unnoticed and less attractive. If the cover 
media is a digital image hidden with secret data, it is called 
“stego-image”. This image provides a carrier for transmitting 
secret data to the desired destination stealthily. Moreover, the 
information hiding technique could be used extensively on 
applications of military, commercials, anti-criminal, and so 
on [1]. 
The scheme of least-significant-bits (LSB) substitution is a 
common and well-known steganographic method [2, 3]. 
Embedded data are converted to substitute the fixed length 
LSB of pixels. However, since some pixels could not tolerate 
changes of substitution during the embedding process, then 
those pixels turn apparently different from their original 
values. This effect appears easily in the smooth area that they 
are noticeable for human eyes. Therefore, an adaptive method

based on using variable amount of bits instead of fixed length 
is proposed [4]. 
Recently, two benchmarks are adopted by steganographic 
techniques to evaluate the performance. First one is the 
capacity of hiding data, and another one is the 
imperceptibility of the stego-image, also called the quality of 
stego-image. Normally, it is difficult to have high capacity 
and great image quality at the same time. The pixel-value 
differencing (PVD) method proposed by Wu and Tsai [5] can 
successfully provide both high embedding capacity and 
outstanding imperceptibility for the stego-image. Just like its 
name, PVD method uses the difference of two consecutive 
pixels to embed the secret data. However, only one 
directional edge is considered and the performance can be 
improved. Therefore, based on PVD method, various 
approaches have been proposed [6-7]. 
In this paper, we propose to use three different directional 
edges effectively and design the tri-way differencing scheme 
to remove the capacity limitation from the original PVD 
method using only one direction. Also, using the reference 
point selection and the adaptive branch condition rules can 
decrease the quality degradation of the stego-image from 
setting higher capacity of embedding data. This can make the 
stego-image still can maintain an acceptable quality. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
reviews the PVD method. In Section 3, the proposed 
construction scheme is presented. Experimental results are 
illustrated and discussed in Section 4, prior to Conclusions in 
Section 5. 
II. REVIEW OF THE PVD METHOD
In the original PVD method [5], a gray-valued cover image 
is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks composed with 
two consecutive pixels, ip  and 1ip + . From each block, a 
difference value id  can be obtained by subtracting ip  from 
1ip + . The set of all difference values ought to range from 
255−  to 255 . Therefore, id  ranges from 0 to 255. Thus, 
the block with a small value id  locates in the smooth area, 
whereas a block with a large value id  is considered as a 
sharply edged block. According to the properties of human 
vision, eyes can tolerate more changes in the sharply edged 
block than in the smooth block. That is, more data can be 
embedded into the edged areas than into the smooth areas. 
Therefore, in the PVD method, the first step is to design a 
range table with n  contiguous ranges ( kR  where

difference value id ′  for 0,1, 2i = . Here, the detailed 
embedding algorithm is left to be described in Subsection D. 
Now, the new pixel values in each pair are different from their 
original ones. That is, we have three different values for the 
starting point ( , )x yp  named 0( , )x yp′ , 1( , )x yp′ , and 2( , )x yp′  from 
0 ,P 1,P  and 2 ,P  respectively. However, there is only one 
value for ( , )i x yp′  can exist after finishing the embedding 
procedures. Therefore, one of ( , )i x yp′  is selected as the 
reference point to offset the other two pixel values. That is, 
two pixel values of one pair are used to adjust the other two 
pairs and construct a new 2 2×  block. Suppose the reference 
point is 1( , )x yp′ , the other two difference values, 0d ′  and 2d ′ ,
can be proven unchanged after the adjustment given by

Note that the embedded secret data are unaffected because of 
those three difference values are unaltered. Selecting different 
reference points results in varied distortion to the stego-image.
Here, we propose an optimal selection approach to achieve 
minimum Mean-Square-Error (MSE). Suppose that 
i i im d d′= − , id  and id ′  are the difference values of pixel 
pair i  before and after embedding procedures. The rules that 
can exactly determine one optimal reference pair without 
really estimating MSE are introduced as follows. 
1) If all of im  are great than 1 or smaller than -1, the 
optimal pixel pair optimali  is the pair with the greatest m .
For example, if { 8, 4, 3}, {0,1, 2},im i= − − − ∈  then 
0optimali = .
2) If all im  have the same sign and only one  {0,1, 1}im ∈ − ,
then the optimal pixel pair optimali  is selected from the 
other two pairs with the smallest m . For example, if 
{4,3,1}, {0,1, 2}im i= ∈ , then 1optimali = .
3) If only one im  has a different sign from the other two 
pairs, the optimal pixel pair optimali  is selected from the 
other two pairs with the smallest m . For example, if 
{7, 4,3}, {0,1,2}im i= − ∈ , then 2optimali = .
4) If only one 0im =  and the other two im  has different 
signs, the optimal pixel pair optimali  is the pair with 0m = .
For example, if {0, 4, 2}, {0,1,2}im i= − ∈ , then 
0optimali = .
5) If there exists more than one pair with 0im =  , the 
optimal pixel pair optimali  can be selected as any one pair 
with 0m = . For example, if {4,0,0}, {0,1, 2}im i= ∈ ,
then 1 or 2optimali = .
C. Adaptive Rules to Reduce Distortion 
Although the proposed approach is feasible for embedding 
secret data, embedding large amount of bits still causes 
serious distortion easily. Since most distortion is generated 
from the offsetting process, we design the following two 
conditions to avoid  too much offset described by 
1) 0_ ( ) 5embedding bit P ≥  and 1_ ( ) 4embedding bit P ≥
2) 0_ ( ) 5embedding bit P <  and 2_ ( ) 6embedding bit P ≥
where _ ( )iembedding bit P  represents the total embedding 
bits along the direction of iP . If either one of above two 
conditions is satisfied, the current block being processed can 
probably result in higher distortion. Then we use two pixel 
pairs, 0P   and 3 ( , 1) ( 1, 1)( , )x y x yP p p+ + += , and adopt the original 
PVD method to individually process those two pairs along 
one direction. Here, we name those two conditions as “branch 
conditions”. 
D. The Embedding Algorithm

3) Compute the amount of secret data bits it  that can be 
embedded in each pair by ,j iR . The value it  can be 
estimated from the width ,j iw  of ,j iR , this can be 
defined by 2 ,log j it w« »= ¬ ¼ .
4) If it  of iP  for 0,1, 2i =  satisfies branch conditions, two 
pixel pairs 0P  and 3P  are processed by the original PVD 
method. Otherwise, the proposed tri-way scheme is used 
to process iP  for 0,1, 2i = .

bit sequence into a decimal value ib .

Note that the it -bit stream is only one part of the secret 
data before embedding. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
To demonstrate the capacity performance of our proposed 
approach for hiding secret data in the stego-image, apart from 
the results of theoretical estimation listed in Table 1, we have 
also conducted different experiments using four images to 
compare the proposed approach with the PVD method. 
According the invisibility benchmark for the watermarked 
images [8], a minimum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) 
value of 38 dB is adopted as the basis for the stego-images in 
the experiments. 
The secret binary data sequence S  is generated by 
pseudo-random numbers. We set the designed range table 
with the width in the set of { }8,8,16,32,64,128kw ∈ . The 
size of all cover images is 512 512× . Here, PSNR is utilized 
to evaluate the invisibility of the stego-images. An example 
of the cover image and its stego-image are shown in Fig. 3. To 
compare the proposed approach with the PVD method, Table 
2 lists the experimental results of embedding the secret data 
using those two approaches. Four images are used and the 
hiding capacity (in bytes) and PSNR achieved by the 
proposed scheme and the PVD method are shown. The listed 
values are the average results after embedding 100 randomly 
generated bit-sequences into the cover images. From Table 2, 
the accomplished capacity ratio of our method to the PVD 
approach is near 1.5 in average. Although the PSNR value is 
smaller than 38 for both schemes after embedding the data 
into the Baboon image, two stego-images are still hardly 
observed that the secret data is hidden inside. This is because 
of the high variance existed in the pixel values of the Baboon 
image. Therefore, the proposed approach can provide a 
promising performance in increasing the capacity of the 
stego-images. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed a steganographic method 
to embed the secret data into still images by using tri-way 
pixel-value differencing. Using three different directional 
edges can hide more secret data into the cover image than the 
PVD method. Also, we have presented an optimal selection 
approach for the reference point and adaptive rules to reduce 
the distortion of the stego-image. Experiment results 
demonstrate that the stego-image quality is imperceptible for 
human vision.  The proposed approach can demonstrate 
superior embedding capacity than the PVD method, not only 
by theoretical estimation, but also from the experimental 
results. Furthermore, the extraction of the embedded secret 
data can work correctly from stego-images without the 
participation of original cover images.
