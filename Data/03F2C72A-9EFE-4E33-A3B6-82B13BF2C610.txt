一、簡介 
本計劃規劃之主要研究重點在於希望透過單元元件堆疊之方式，於電路操作上形成直流串聯的效
果，藉此提高整體操作電壓，進而達到提升輸出功率以及線性度之目的。在串聯後之阻抗部分，
由於電壓在相同電流狀況下以倍數方式提升，同時可以達到提高阻抗且易於匹配的效果。此一構
想主要希望藉由電路串聯之設計來協助提高元件可操作之電壓，換句話說，整體製程上不須為了
提升崩潰電壓進行任何特殊之考量。理論而言，在理想狀況下，堆疊 N 個元件單元便可以操作在
N 倍之汲極操作電壓。本結案報告將針對單一元件製程結果及其特性進行完整介紹，同時亦針對單
一元件之溫度分佈效應進行分析；此外，在實際堆疊過程中所遭遇之問題亦一併說明。為了驗證
所提出構想在電路實現上之可行性，我們利用 0.15um pHEMT 製程實際設計了一堆疊電路並完成
功能測試，相關結果亦將於報告中詳述。 
二、工作原理概述 
圖一所示為一個四個單元堆疊成之電路架構，在此架構中，閘極端之電阻值需要透過電路之直流
分析以確保每一個單元的電晶體均操作在同一偏壓點，意即有相同的汲極電流和相同的汲極－源
極與閘極－源極電壓。在此結構中的另一個重點在於最上端單元包括了一個由汲極到閘極的廻授
電阻(R5)，此廻授電阻存在有其必要性，由於此電阻的存在，將可以確保在輸出端之電壓可達其最
大振幅進而獲得最大之功率輸出，反之，在此廻授電阻不存在的情形下，每一單元之閘極電壓被
維持恆定而源極電壓將隨著輸入電壓之振幅而改變，此種操作模式將導致元件提早崩潰，主因在
於閘極到源極可允許之電壓變化有限，造成較低的輸出功率，反之，當廻授電阻 R5 存在時，閘極
端之輸入電壓之振幅會由迴授電阻所提供之路徑隨著汲極端之電壓振幅成正向變化，也因而可以
達成與源極的電壓大小相互追踪(voltage tracking)的目的，如此一來，整體 HiVP 架構可以視為有 4
倍(如果有 4 個 cell)汲極電壓。表一所示則為此 HiVP 架構相較於傳統架構之優點列表。

此不再贅述詳細元件製程之每一個步驟。圖三所示為實際元件佈局圖，圖中兩元件之大小分別為
100um 及 200um，而值得一提的是我們採用 non-backside 製程，也因而所有的接地須透過走線相連
接後再以打線之方式與外接地做 grounding，或透過 GSG probe 之接觸達成。

為了驗證所提出構想在電路實現上之可行性，我們利用 0.15um pHEMT 製程 (WIN Semiconductor)
實際設計了一堆疊電路在設計過程中，首先我們先針對一個 4x75μm 的電晶體進行偏壓選擇，使其
操作於 IDS=80mA，其偏壓為 VG1=-0.4V、VD1=2V，而設計為 80mA 的用意在於使輸出阻抗能夠直
接達到 50 Ohm，進而降低匹配網路之必要性，意即可以用最少的匹配元件達到所要求之頻寬。接
著為了使此兩級之 IDS1 與 IDS2 相同，我們必須讓兩級之 VGS相同，而為了使兩級之 VGS相同，我們
就必須使 VG1=VG2，並且第二級之 VD2=2VD1。最後再藉由搭配 R1=200 Ohm 及 R2=166 Ohm，我們
便可以使 VG1=VG2。圖十四為透過 CIC 下線後製成之晶片，圖十五為小訊號量測結果，可以看出
非常寬之頻寬表現。圖十六為功率量測結果，由圖可見此一架構在輸出功率上亦有寬頻及恒定之
特性，由上述之結果可以明顯驗證此構想在具體電路設計上之可行性。

ABSTRACT 
Recently, GaN-based devices on Si substrates have attracted much attention for high power electronic application. 
Due to the superior material properties, AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have realized 
high breakdown voltage characteristics [1]. However, high dislocation density is usually generated in GaN film 
due to the large lattice mismatch (17%) between GaN and Si substrate. The threading dislocations are paths for 
leakage current which affects the breakdown voltage of the GaN devices [2]. In order to improve the GaN crystal 
quality, it is necessary to design a proper buffer layer structure to reduce the threading dislocation propagation and 
further improve the breakdown voltage. 
 
In this work, 0.4-μm-thick GaN was grown on Si substrates using AlN and double AlGaN buffer layers. The 
quality of double AlGaN buffer layers which consisted of Al0.29Ga0.71N and Al0.07Ga0.93N was characterized by 
high resolution X-ray diffraction. The result is shown in Fig. 1. Rocking curves for GaN (002) and GaN (102) 
reflections reveal full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 934 and 1262 arcsec, respectively. As GaN 
thickness was increased to 2 μm, the FWHMs for GaN (002) and GaN (102) were further reduced to 572 and 675 
arcsec, respectively, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Fig. 3(a) is a cross-sectional TEM image, showing the whole 
epitaxial structure of GaN on Si substrate. The dislocations density in GaN film is much lower than those in 
AlGaN and AlN films. Some dislocations were annihilated in the AlGaN film which acts as a dislocation filter 
during GaN growth. Lattice image of GaN/AlGaN interface in Fig. 3(b) shows the crystalline atomic arrangement. 
Hall mobility of 1110 cm2/V-s and a sheet concentration of 1.38×1013 cm-2 were measured when the AlGaN/GaN 
HEMT structure was grown on this double AlGaN buffer layers. Breakdown voltage of 170 V was achieved when 
measured between two ohmic contacts of 10-μm-thick gap. These results indicate that the use of double AlGaN 
buffer layers is an effective way to eliminate the dislocation density in GaN film and the good device 
performances can be achieved by this way.

Abstract  —  A new approach for the measurement of 
radiation patterns for passive RFID tag antenna under chip-
loaded condition using Friis equation is proposed in this paper.  
Different from the conventional situation where the antenna is 
matched to 50Ω, the RFID tag antennas are usually designed to 
match to the conjugate chip impedance for maximum power 
transfer.  Besides, the impedance of the tag IC usually varies 
with received power and thus traditional way of characterizing 
the radiation patterns and gain of the tag antenna using 
50Ω system may not be adequate. Based on the Friis equation, 
the proposed approach provides a straightforward way of 
determin-ing the radiation patterns of tag antenna under chip 
loaded condition.  The proposed approach has been applied to 
the measurement of two types of commercially available tags 
and proven effective. 
Index Terms — passive RFID, tag, measured pattern, Friis 
equation. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is a 
rapidly developing technology which uses RF signals for 
automatic object identification and data acquisition in a 
contactless sense.  The basic operation principle of passive 
RFID can be traced back to the modulated backscatter back 
in 1948 [1], where the communication protocol sent from tag 
back to reader (the backward link) was modulated by 
reflecting back the CW signal with different load impedances.  
The most fascinating feature for a passive RFID system lies 
in the fact that the tag does not require any form of external 
DC power supply.  All the power required to turn the tag IC 
is converted from the RF power from the reader.  The other 
important feature that makes passive RFID system very 
popular is that it does not need line of sight between the tag 
and the reader to establish the communication link.  With the 
breakthrough in the IC technology that drives the manu-
facturing cost down drastically, passive RFID systems have 
been widely applied in warehouse management, 
transportation payments, supply chain management ,and so 
on [2].  
The design as well as the characterization of the RFID tag 
antenna has been very challenging and the majority of 
research efforts have been devoted to the design part [3-5].  
Unlike the ordinary case where the antennas are designed to 
match to real impedance of either 50Ω or 75Ω system, the tag 
antennas are loaded with the complex impedance of the chip.  
In general, the tag IC’s consume very little current and need 
reasonable voltage to turn on the charge pump diode of the 
voltage multiplier circuitry [6].  Hence, the IC’s always have 
a high impedance level in parallel to the antenna input.  The 
design challenge then lies in the arrangements in the 
matching configurations to provide conjugate match to the 
chip for good power transfer within the size constraint of the 
tag for specific applications.  Besides, a very unique 
characteristic of the IC impedance is that it changes with the 
total RF power received.  Apparently, conventional way of 
characterizing an antenna by its input return loss and 
radiation patterns in a real impedance system may not be 
adequate for RFID systems. 
The conventional approach of measuring the radiation 
characteristics of an antenna matched to real impedance, say 
50Ω, utilizes a standard antenna as the transmitter.  The 
antenna under test (AUT), placed on a turntable, rotates as 
the received power is recorded at each specific spatial 
location with respect to the pre-defined coordinate systems 
[7-8].  As described previously, characterization of RFID tag 
antennas using such approach may not be adequate since a 
complex load is presented at the antenna input.  Moreover, 
the corresponding impedance level varies with the actual 
power received by the tag.  In our proposed approach, 
general procedure for antenna measurement is adopted 
accompanied by Friis equation [9] for the determination of 
the radiation patterns under the chip loaded condition.  This 
proposed method has been applied for practical measurement 
cases of commercially available tags and the results have 
been validated.

The proposed approach was applied to measure the 
radiation patterns of two commercially available tags as 
shown in Fig. 2, ALN-9554 and ALN-9640 manufactured by 
Alien Technology [10]. ALR-9800 [10] reader with a 
circularly polarized antenna was adopted in the measurement.  
The RF power level out of the reader was 30 dBm and the 
reader antenna had a peak gain of 6 dBi to comply with the 
regulation of maximum 4W EIRP. In order to remove the 
possible multipath propagation from the background, the 
measurement was performed in an anechoic chamber as 
shown in Fig. 3.  Fig. 4 shows the measured radiation pattern 
of the circularly polarized reader antenna. It is clearly 
observed that the peak gain of the antenna is 6 dBi.

coordinate system setup of (a) x-y and (b) x-z cuts for the 
measurement system. The measurement procedure starts with 
lining up the tag with the center of the reader antenna where 
peak gain occurred. Then the distance between the tag and 
the antenna was increased to the extent that the MRR was 
achieved and this MRR was recorded as max
pR  since it 
occurred at the location of the peak reader antenna gain.

Abstract  —  Design of an aperture-coupled patch antenna for 
applications in radio frequency identification (RFID) system 
operating at UFH (915 MHz) and microwave (2.4 GHz) bands is 
presented in this paper.  The novelty of the proposed structure 
lies in the fact that the coupling aperture for the patch antenna 
is designed as the slot antenna radiating at UHF frequency.  The 
front-to-back ratio at UHF band was improved through the 
implementation of a non-radiating parasitic ring director in the 
structure.  The measurement results of the prototype reveal that 
the proposed antenna is well suitable for dual-band RFID 
mobile terminal applications.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is rapidly 
developing technology which is widely adopted for various 
data collection applications such as warehouse and retail item 
management [1]. Currently, several frequency bands have 
been assigned to RFID applications, such as 125 kHz, 13.56 
MHz, 840~960 MHz, 2.45GHz, and 5.8 GHz. The 
Microwave RFID band 2.45 GHz is allocated around the 
frequency range from 2.4GHz to 2.4835 GHz. Compared to 
the UHF RFID systems around 900 MHz, the 2.45 GHz 
systems have the advantages of compactness, flexibility, and 
maneuverability for the item management applications.   
With the drastic breakthrough in RFID technologies, the 
mobility of RFID system has been greatly improved.  
Portable devices such as handheld readers and mobile 
terminals have become very popular especially in retails 
management and logistics applications.  Figure 1 shows the 
conceptual drawing of RFID mobile reader installed on a 
forklift [2]. Different from antenna designs for fixed reader, 
the antenna design in an RFID handheld reader should fulfill 
several unique requirements, such as high gain, high front-to-
back ratio, high directivity and high efficiency.  
First of all, antenna with higher gain helps to increase read 
range for the same transmitted RF power, or equivalently one 
can decrease the transmitted power to achieve the same range. 
In compliance with maximum allowed 4W EIRP for 
Microwave RFID systems, the latter option is perhaps more 
valuable as it implies lower power consumption by the 
transmitter and thus longer battery life, which in turn 
guarantees robust operation duration. Secondly, for 
applications in RFID mobile terminals, antennas are likely to 
be close to human body. Therefore, for the associated health 
issue, the high front-to-back ratio can prevent users from 
exposure to the radiated electromagnetic energy. Additionally, 
in order to easily find the targeted tag reads, higher front-to-
back ratio is always desired.  In stationary applications, a 
narrow antenna beam may unduly constrain the read zone 
and cause tags to be missed, but in a mobile device the user 
gains information about the location of a tag from the 
behavior of tag reads as they redirect the antenna, which can 
provide fine read accuracy for such applications.

Research efforts have been devoted to meet the 
requirement of the antenna of RFID mobile terminal 
applications [3-6]. Printed dipole antennas using balun feed 
with truncated ground was commonly used to improve gain 
and front-to-back ratio in the past [5,6]. The surface wave is 
excited from the balun feed, and propagated in front direction 
due to the truncated ground as a reflector makes the 
backward wave bounced. Such approach can provide high 
gain and front-to-back ratio, but the performance is usually

back ratio.  However, tradeoff has to be made between the 
performance and overall size constraint.  The simulated and 
measured S11 are shown in Figure 6 demonstrating excellent 
agreement between each other.  The measured radiation 
patterns at 915MHz and 2.45 GHz are shown in the Figure 7.  
As shown in the figure, the front-to-back ratio are about 
5.414 dB and 14.37 dB at 915MHz and 2.45 GHz, 
respectively. The gain from the measurement is about 3.65 
and 8.49 dBi at 915MHz and 2.45 GHz, respectively. 
Compared with the omni-directional pattern of slot antenna, 
the front-to-back ratio and gain have been progressed 
substantially. Figure 8 shows the electric field plot for the 
proposed antenna at both bands.
