III. Results and Discussion 
Figure 3(a), (b), and (c) show the thermal radiation 
spectra of emitters at 280 oC with SiO2 thickness of 500 nm, 
100 nm, and 60 nm, respectively. In Fig. 3(a), peaks at 3.8 
μm are due to the degenerate modes composed of (±1,0) 
Ag/SiO2, (0,±1) Ag/SiO2, (-1,1) Ag/SiO2, (1,-1) Ag/SiO2 
modes [3], designated as (1,0) degenerated Ag/SiO2 mode. It 
is almost the same as the theoretical peak position at 3.79 
μm. The peak located at 3 μm is due to the cross coupling of 
the Ag/SiO2 mode and Ag/Air mode [3]. When the thickness 
of SiO2 reduces from 500 to 100 nm, the emission peak 
shifts from 3.8 μm to 4.56 μm as shown in Fig. 3(b). As the 
thickness of SiO2 becomes 60 nm, the emission peak shifts 
further to 5.34 μm as shown in Fig. 3(c), which is far away 
from the theoretical value. More light is generated in the 
thicker SiO2 layer and the degenerate (1,0) Ag/SiO2 modes 
are easier to distinguish. The red shift of emission peaks 
with the reduction of SiO2 thickness results from the 
coupling of surface plasmons between top and bottom metal 
plates. It is because the surface plasmons are also induced at 
the interface between the bottom silver film and SiO2 by the 
field of surface plasmons in top silver film when the 
thickness of SiO2 is not thick enough. 
Figure 4(a), (b), (c), and (d) display the reflection dispersion 
relations of emitters with SiO2 thickness of 500, 100, 60, and 
0 nm, respectively, for light propagating in ΓK direction 
with different incident angle. Dark lines on dispersion 
relation represent the dips in reflection spectra. Light which 
satisfies the momentum conservation and the dispersion 
relation of surface plasmons can couple with the surface 
plasmons. Therefore, less light are reflected from the 
emitters when satisfied with the coupling conditions. The six 
degenerate modes at 3.8 μm ( 0.326 eV ) for normal 
incidence light split into four dispersion lines as denoted in      
Fig. 4(a) when light incident angle increases ( vector xk
ρ
 
increases ). This dispersion relation provides the evidence 
that main mechanism of the thermal emission peak is due to 
the coupling of light with surface plasmons. Other dark lines 
in higher energy region are due to the higher order modes of 
surface plasmons. When the thickness of SiO2 is 100 nm, the 
dispersion relation is still the same but with all bands shift to 
lower energy slightly. Figure 4(c) shows the dispersion 
relation of emitter with SiO2 thickness of 60 nm. Now the 
degenerate Ag/SiO2 modes are at 0.23 eV which is 
consistent with the radiation emission peak at 5.34 μm (0.23 
eV) shown in Fig. 4.3(c). If no SiO2 layer exists in the 
plasmonic emitter, i.e. thickness of SiO2 equals to 0 nm, the 
dispersion curves due to the Ag/SiO2 surface plasmons mode 
all disappear except that of the Ag/Air mode as shown in Fig. 
4(d). This confirms again that the physical origin involved in 
the thermal emitter is the excitation of surface plasmons at 
the Ag/SiO2 interface. The split behaviors are all the same 
for emitters with different SiO2 thickness. It means the 
coupling of surface plasmons changes the energy of 
themselves. If the coupling effect is enhanced, surface 
plasmons can be induced by the light with longer 
wavelength even though the periodic structure on top Ag 
film is the same. The relation between peak position of 
degenerate (1,0) Ag/SiO2 mode and SiO2 is shown in Fig. 
5(a). The peak position can be fitted using an exponential 
function to determine the coupling length of (1,0) Ag/SiO2 
mode in the Ag/SiO2/Ag triple layer structure. The fitting 
curve is 3.93.6
58 += − xey , where x is the thickness of SiO2 
in nm. As the thickness of SiO2, x, increase to infinity, the 
peak position y approaches 3.9 μm which is very close to the 
theoretical value of 3.79 μm. The coupling length in this 
structure is 58 nm which is much shorter than that of 
Ag/SiO2 mode in a Ag/SiO2/Si triple layer structure [8]. It is 
because the strong coupling of surface plasmons between the 
two silver films. It can be seen that when the thickness of 
SiO2 is less than 100 nm, the peak position redshift 
substantially with the reduction of SiO2 thickness. The 
coupling of surface plasmons becomes less apparent when 
the SiO2 thickness exceeds 300 nm. 
Collin. et. al. [7] have theoretically calculated the coupling 
strength of surface plasmons in a metal/dielectric/metal 
structure. Their conclusion is that the coupling of surface 
plasmons increases the effective refractive index of the 
intermediate dielectric medium resulting in the redshift of 
wavelength. According to their work, the equation of 
effective refractive index of transverse magnetic (TM) mode 
in a thin dielectric layer sandwiched by two metal layers is 
given as follows

IV. Conclusions 
In conclusion, the emission spectra and reflection 
dispersion relations of Ag/SiO2/Ag thermal plasmonic 
emitters with different SiO2 thickness were investigated 
experimentally. The position of thermal emission peak of a 
plasmonic emitter is not only determined by the periodic 
structure on top Ag film, but also affected by the thickness 
of intermediate SiO2. Surface plasmons at the top and 
bottom Ag/SiO2 interface couple together if the thickness of 
SiO2 is not thick enough. This coupling effect makes the 
effective refractive index of SiO2 increase and therefore 
results in the redshift of the Ag/SiO2 SPs mode. The 
coupling length turns out to be 58 nm.

the incident angle as shown in Fig. 6(a). G
ρ
 is the 
reciprocal lattice vector of Ag grating with aG /2π=ρ , 
where a is the lattice constant, and i is integer. 
Figure 7(c) shows the dispersion relation of SPs in sample B 
which is the Ag/SiO2/Ag tri-layer plasmonic thermal emitter 
with the same top Ag grating film as that of sameple A, i.e., 
a = 4 μm, d = 2 μm. The darker line around 0.15 eV 
representing the reflection dip is attributed to the asymmetric 
longitudinal optical (AS1 LO) phonon vibration mode of the 
SiO2 layer [21]. The grating-coupled SP modes (Ag/air 
[± 1], Ag/air [-2], and Ag/air [-3]) were still observable. 
However, the Ag/SiO2 grating-coupled SP modes totally 
disappeared. Moreover, there exists four additional darker 
lines at about 0.12, 0.19, 0.33, and 0.49 eV instead. Different 
from the splitting characteristic of Ag/air grating-coupled SP 
modes, these four lines are almost independent of the 
incident angles. The group velocity of these four modes, / xkω∂ ∂ , at the x-direction is zero, which implies that these 
induced SPPs are localized. It is because when the thickness 
of SiO2 layer is thin enough, the induced propagating SPs at 
the top Ag/SiO2 interface will couple with the SPs at the 
bottom Ag/SiO2 interface [22-24]. This coupling effect 
results in the confinement of SPs at the top Ag/SiO2 
interface and forms LSPP modes underneath the metal lines. 
The LSPP modes exhibit the Fabry-Perot type resonance, i.e., 
the wavelength of incident light λ  and the Ag grating line 
 width d  satisfy , where m is 
integer and  is the effective refractive index of 
dielectric medium at λ  which will be influenced by the 
coupling effect of SPs [14,15]. The darker lines at 0.12, 0.19, 
0.33 and 0.49 eV are 1=m , 1=m , 2=m , and 
3=m  LSPP modes, respectively. Two 1=m  LSPP 
modes exist at 0.12 and 0.19 eV, which is due to the obvious 
difference of refraction index of SiO2 at wavelength of 
incident light λ  of 6.3 μm (0.19 eV) and 10.5 μm (0.12 
eV). The refraction index of thick SiO2 at 6.3 and 10.5 μm 
are n = 1.23 and 2.20, respectively [25]. These free space 
wavelengths in the SiO2 shrink to 5.12 and 4.7 μm, 
respectively. In our Ag/SiO2/Ag plasmonic thermal emitter, 
the SiO2 is thin (100 nm), the coupling of Ag/SiO2 SPs at 
both top and bottom metal/dielectric interface will 
effectively increase the refraction index [23] 1.25 to 1.17 
times, i.e., 63.2≈effn at 6.3 μm,  54.1≈effn at 10.5 
μm.  
Figure 7(d) is the thermal radiation spectrum of sample B at 
260 oC. The emission peaks at 6.3 and 10.5 μm are 
consistent with the two 1=m  LSPP modes as shown in 
Fig. 7(c), which confirms that the mechanism involved in 
the emission of plasmonic thermal emitter is due to the 
excitation of LSPPs. When the emitter is heated, the thermal 
radiation generated in the SiO2 layer resonates between two 
silver films. Then Ag/SiO2 LSPPs are induced and converted 
to light radiation. 
Figures 8(a)-8(c) show the thermal radiation spectra of 
samples B, C, and D, respectively. These emitters have the 
same Ag grating line width d = 2 μm but different lattice 
constant a, i.e., 4, 5, 6 μm. Different from the plasmonic 
thermal emitters whose emission peaks are determined by 
lattice constant a demonstrated by Tsai et al [13,14], these 
emitters have the same emission peaks at about 6.3 and 10.5 
μm which correspond to the two 1=m  LSPP modes. 
Figures 9(a)-9(c) show the thermal radiation spectra of 
emitters F, C, and E, respectively. These emitters have the 
same lattice constant a = 5 mμ  but different Ag grating line 
width d, i.e., 2.5, 2, 1.4 μm. The emission peaks shift from 5 
and 10.1 μm, 6.3 and 10.5 μm to 7 and 11 μm as the Ag 
grating line width d increases from 1.4 to 2.5 μm. According 
to the above result, the emission peaks attributed to the 
LSPP modes are independent of lattice constant and shift to 
long wavelength as the top Ag line width increases, which is 
consistent with the Fabry-Perot resonance. The refraction 
index of thick SiO2 at 5, 7, 10.1 and 11 μm are n = 1.342, 
1.09, 2.59 and 1.93, respectively. When SiO2 layer is thin 
(100 nm), they will be increased 1.17 to 1.3 times of the 
original values. 
In order to measure the polarization of the emitted light, 
a polarizer is placed between plasmonic thermal emitter and 
detector. Figure 10 shows the thermal radiation spectra of 
emitter B with polarizer angles of 0o, 30o, 60o, and 90o. The 
axis of polarizer is perpendicular to the metallic line when θ  is 0o. As the polarizer angle increases, the emittance of 
the two 1=m  LSPP emission peaks at 6.3 and 10.5 μm 
become weaker. Moreover, the emission peaks finally 
disappear when the polarizer angle reaches 90o. It implies 
that the emitted light is linearly polarized, and the 
polarization of the light radiated from such plasmonic 
thermal emitter is perpendicular to the parallel metal lines. It 
is because LSPPs exhibit the Fabry-Perot resonance in the 
x-direction, and the induced SPPs tend to couple with the 
local charge dipole oscillations between the long edges [26], 
i.e., only light generated from SiO2 layer with polarization 
perpendicular to metallic lines can induce LSPPs. 
 
IV. Conclusions 
 
In summary, the dispersion relation of LSPP and 
emission spectra of narrow-bandwidth plasmonic thermal 
emitters with one-dimensional Ag grating are investigated. 
The SPs induced at the top Ag/SiO2 interface will couple 
with the SPs at the bottom Ag/SiO2 interface if the SiO2 
layer is thin enough. Instead of propagating along the top 
Ag/SiO2 interface, the SPs are localized and exhibit the 
Fabry-Perot resonance. The thermal emission peaks of 
plasmonic thermal emitter are independent of lattice 
constant and redshift as the top Ag line width increases. In 
addition, the polarization of the emitted light is 
perpendicular to the metal lines.
