1 Introduction 
Frequency selective surface (FSS), which is two-dimensional periodic structure, has widespread 
applications over much of electromagnetic spectrum because of its filtering property. In the 
microwave region, a FSS can make an reflector antennas more efficient, and in radome design, it 
provides bandpass transmission characteristic at the operator frequency of the antenna [1]. In the 
far-infrared region, a FSS is used as polarizers and beam splitter [2], and in infrared sensor, a 
FSS absorbs the desired frequencies in the substrate material backing the screen [2]. Recently, 
FSS realize the multiband artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) surface, known as metamaterial, 
improve antenna performances and reduce surface wave within the substrate[3]. The split ring 
resonators (SRR) proposed by Pendry et al. [4] were shown to exhibit strong magnetic response 
to the incident field. In the long wavelength limit, the effective permeability of the SRR structure 
can be negative. Therefore, SRR serve as the key element for a left handed composite medium 
where the permeability and permittivity are simultaneously negative. 
Equivalent circuit model, mutual impedance approach and modal (integral) method are three 
major methods to analyze FSS. Here we use integral method and solve it by moment method. 
Simple is the benefit of equivalent circuit, but this method cannot handle arbitrary element shape 
and dielectric loading effects, and it is only accurate up to the resonant frequency of the screen. 
However, Ohira [5] purpose some equivalent circuit model to govern arbitrary shape FSS. 
Patch and aperture type of FSS, element shape, size, lattice constant, dielectric, grating lobes 
and Wood’s anomalies effect the transmission and reflection profiles of FSS.

3 Numerical Results 
3.1 Patch and Aperture  
At resonance, a patch-element freestanding FSS has total reflection, whereas an aperture-element 
freestanding FSS has total transmission, that is, a patch-element FSS is a bandstop filter while an 
aperture-element FSS is a bandpass filter. 
If the conducting screen is perfect conductor, the thickness of the conducting screen is 
infinitely thin without dielectrics, from Babinet’s principle, the reflection coefficient for patch 
equals the transmission coefficient as shown in FIGURE 3-1.The element shape is square with 
length equal to  illuminated by the normally incident field polarized in y direction, the 
lattice constant for x and y direction both equal to . A

3.2 Dielectric Effect 
3.2.1 Permittivity 
For infinite extent dielectric, the resonant frequency 0f of freestanding FSS will shift to lower 
frequency with the factor effε , where is the effective relative permittivity. The effε  is given by 
 5
3.2.2 Thickness 
In previous section, the resonant frequency was 0 efff ε ,if the thickness of dielectric assumed 
infinitely extent. In this section we show that the resonant frequency was decreased with the 
increase in the thickness of the dielectric layer surrounding FSS as shown in FIGURE 3-6. But 
actually if the thickness of dielectric increase up to 0.05 rλ [8], where rλ  denotes the resonant 
wavelength of freestanding FSS, the resonant frequency have no significant decrease, and its 
value is approximately equal to 0 efff ε . 
 
FIGURE 3-6 As the thickness of dielectric increases, the resonant frequency will decrease. 
3.3 Lattice Constant (Periodic Spacing) 
Lattice constant affects the bandwidth of an FSS. In general, the increase of lattice constant will 
decrease the bandwidth. However, Munk[8] shows some exception.

attributed to electric resonance and the other to magnetic resonance. Basically, the electric 
resonance can be attained as long as the incident electric field has a component parallel to the 
FSS plane, whereas the magnetic resonance can be achieved if the incident magnetic field has a 
component normal to the FSS plane, or the incident electric field has a component parallel to the 
ring edge with gap. In the latter case, the electric field can couple to the magnetic resonance 
through the ring gap. However, both resonances can produce gaps in the transmission spectra, 
around which the induced currents are enhanced to maximum values and the incident waves are 
hindered or even blocked. 
For the electric type of resonance, the induced currents on the SRR elements oscillate in phase, 
giving rise to a strong reflection. Across the resonant frequency, the induced current switches its 
orientation. Due to symmetry of the current pattern, the net effect of magnetic response is 
negligible. For the magnetic type of resonance, the induced current circulates around the SRR 
element. In addition to enhancement of the induced current near the resonance, its circulating 
direction is reversed across the resonant frequency. A redshift of the resonant frequency with 
increasing the ring size, and a blueshift with increasing the gap size are observed. This is 
consistent with the characteristic of the equivalent LC circuit for the SRR element. In order to 
further evaluate the two types of resonances for FSS, the electric and magnetic dipole moments 
per unit cell are calculated. It is shown that the electric dipole moment attains the maximum 
value at the electric resonance, and the magnetic dipole moment changes signs across the 
magnetic resonant frequency. With the help of the expressions for the electric and magnetic 
dipole moments, coherent nature of the induced current for the electric resonance and circulating 
nature for the magnetic resonance are also revealed. 
FIGURE 3-12 shows the schematic diagram of the SRR element for the FSS structure. In this 
study, we choose lattice constant a = 24 mm, l = 15 mm, w = 4:5 mm, and d = 3 mm. 
Denoting the surface current vector by sJ , the electric and magnetic dipole moments are 
given as [15, 16]

its orientation and the current strength is reduced away from the resonant frequency. This is 
manifest on the magnitude of the electric dipole moment , as shown in | |p FIGURE 3-15. At the 
resonant frequency, the electric dipole moment attains the maximum value. This comes from the 
coherent oscillation of sJ , as can be understood from Eq. (2). For oblique incidence ( ), the 
resonant frequency may split into two ones, as seen in 
>0θ D
FIGURE 3-13. At larger incident angles, 
the frequencies of the two resonant modes separate more distantly from each other. For , 
the electric resonances occur at f = 8.1 and 12.3 GHz, while for , the electric resonances 
occur at f = 6:6 and 11.85 GHz. The degeneracy lifting comes from a phase delay of the incident 
wavefront between the edges of SRR element. The transmission dips of lower and higher 
frequencies correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric induced current patterns, respectively. 
For TE incidence with the incident electric field polarized parallel to the edge with gap, the 
electric resonances occur at about the same frequencies.

FIGURE 3-17 shows the transmitted 
dips at f = 8:3 and 12.5 GHz for , and f = 6:6 and 11.7 GHz for . In this 
polarization, the transmission dips are sharper, and for larger oblique incidences the dip values 
are much larger than those in the other polarization (cf. 
=30θ D =60θ D
FIGURE 3-13). However, if the incident 
electric field does not have components along the FSS plane, electric resonances may disappear.

FIGURE 3-18 shows the transmitted power for TM incidence (the incident magnetic field lies

transmission dip occur. In the limiting case of  (the dashed line), the transmitted power

incident angle θ . Note that magnetic resonances for different incident angles occur at the same 
frequency f = 4.35 GHz, around which the induced currents are enhanced and the incident waves 
are hindered to different degrees. Although the transmission dip feature is similar 
to the electric one, the mechanism of magnetic resonance is quite different. FIGURE 3-19 shows 
the induced currents near the magnetic resonance for various incident angles. As θ  increases, 
the induced current on the lower edge changes its direction, and that on the left edge becomes 
stronger. As a result, a circulating current begins to take shape on the SRR element and the 
magnetic resonance gradually appears. 
If the incident electric field is polarized parallel to the edge with gap, as shown in FIGURE 3-17, 
the magnetic resonance occurs for normal as well as oblique incidence. This is due to electric 
coupling to the magnetic resonance through the electric field across the ring gap. In this case, the 
incident waves are blocked at the resonant frequency with nearly null transmitted power. The 
magnetic resonance also accompanies with the sign change of the magnetic dipole moment given 
in Eq. (3.5). FIGURE 3-21 shows the magnetic dipole moment (3) for normal incidence. Across 
the resonant frequency, the real part of the magnetic dipole moment goes from positive to 
negative value, where the imaginary part reaches the minimum. In the meanwhile, the circulating 
current turns from counterclockwise to clockwise direction, as shown in FIGURE 3-22. In this 
regard, the effective magnetic permeability of the FSS structure can be negative if the magnetic 
resonance is strong enough. The magnetic resonant frequency 0f  is basically determined by the 
effective inductance L and capacitance C of the equivalent  circuit for the SRR element, 
that is, 
LC
0 1 1f LC= = . Figure ?? shows the transmitted power for various ring sizes. A redshift of 
0f  with increasing the ring size l is observed. This is because the inductance L of the SRR is 
proportional to the area enclosed by the ring, and therefore a larger l corresponds to a lower 0f . 
For the same reason, a similar frequency shift can be found for a smaller ring width w (with the 
same ring size l), as shown in Fig. ??. In addition, the effect of the gap size on the transmitted 
power is shown in Fig. ??. A blueshift of 0f  with increasing the gap width d is observed, for C 
is inversely proportional to d, and larger d corresponds to higher 0f .

3.6.3 Multi-Layered SRR 
For multilayered FSS, The effect of the number of layers on the transmitted power is shown in       
FIGURE 3-23 for normal incidence with the incident electric field polarized normal to the edge 
with gap. As the number of layers increases, the transmission dip splits and gradually expands. 
For five layers of FSS, a wide stop band with nearly null transmission is formed between 8.2 and

4 Concluding Remarks 
Many design parameters of FSS, such as patch and aperture, thickness and permittivity of 
dielectrics, periodic spacing, and Wood’s anomalies have been demonstrated how these 
parameters affect the reflection and transmission coefficient. Patch-type FSS exhibits bandstop 
behavior while aperture-type FSS exhibits bandpass property. For the FSS embedded in infinitely 
extent dielectric (typically 0.05λ ), the resonant frequency will shift to lower frequency with 
factor is effε . For the thickness of dielectric between  and 0.050 λ , the resonant frequency 
will be somewhere between 0f  and 0 efff ε . The bandwidth decreases while lattice constant 
increases. We also presented Wood’s anomalies which denote the transmission null here. Finally, 
we showed a multi-layered FSS called Yee-surface, which its resonant frequency does not be 
affected by polarization and incident angle. 
metamaterials which exhibit novel electromagnetic properties not found in nature can be 
realized by FSS such as SRR. The SRR structure can be thought as LC resonant oscillator in 
circuit theory. We have shown the SRR pattern with different polarizations and incident angles. 
In transmitted power spectrum of SRR have two significant dips of SRR due to electric 
resonance and effective magnetic resonance though without magnetic material. We also h 
showed that electric and magnetic dipole moments of FRR at resonance frequencies have 
remarkable changes. The current density of SRR also changed its direction. Finally, we showed 
that multilayered SRRs that can increase the bandwidth at resonance peak.
