全球定位系統(GPS)可全天候提供精確的位置、速度與時間的資訊給全球的使用者。在 GPS
系統中，其導航數據資料是利用直接展頻 (DS-SS) 分碼多工的方式進行傳遞。而 Galileo 為歐盟
所規劃設計發展的一個全球性、全天候，多項服務的三維空間即時定位系統。其技術部份是由
JU(Joint Undertaking)所控管。利用三角定位原理以取得接收機之位置; 並藉由定位系統提供多
樣性的服務。由於展頻本身具抗干擾性，GPS 可利用 C/A 碼 43 dB 的程序增益(Processing gain:
PG)，將小功率的干擾信號予以壓制，但是當干擾源功率增大，而超過程序增益時，此時將導致接
收機之同步迴路發生信號處理失鎖，而無法接收衛星訊號。改進的方法就是必須加入抗干擾的功
能來彌補以上的狀況發生。

Abstract: The global positioning system (GPS) and the future advent of European Navigation system
Galileo can provide accurate positioning and timing information useful in many applications. The
GPS/Galileo satellites broadcast ranging codes and navigation data with the technique of direct sequence
spread spectrum (DS-SS). Although DS-SS inherently can cope with low power narrowband and
wideband obstacles by its near 43-dB processing gain, it cannot cope with high power obstacles. The
approaches of system performances that can be further enhanced by preprocessing to reject the intentional
or unintentional jamming will be investigated in this project.
We study the adaptive method to suppress wideband and narrowband interference in GPS/Galileo
system. The received signal is first transformed to time-frequency distribution. The Winger Hough
transform (WHT) is an effective ways to estimate the instantaneous frequency of interfering signals
embedded in noise. Once the parameters are estimated, the adaptive interference excisor is applied to
accomplish the jamming rejection. The simulation results of the adaptive interference excisor (AIE) are
obtained by using Matlab/ SystemView tool to verify the performances. Four types of narrowband
interference, i.e. continuous wave interference (CWI), multi-tone CWI (MCWI), swept CWI (SCWI), and
pulsed CWI (PCWI), are considered to emulate realistic circumstances. The interference-to-noise ratio
(INR) is varied from 20 to 50 dB. The anti-jamming performances are evaluated via extensive simulation
by computing mean squared prediction error (MSPE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements.

b. Galileo signal
Galileo is a global, all-weather and twenty-four-hours, precise three-dimensional navigation system,
which is developed by JU (Joint Undertaking) of ESA. It has been developed collaboratively by the
European Union (EU), the European Space Agency (SPA) and European industry. It is design for civilian
applications, but it is also aimed to be used for security applications. Galileo is to provide enhanced signal
structure and system capabilities in order to allow for the availability of new services and applications.
Galileo services include (1) open service (OS), free of charge, to be used for mass-market application, (2)
commercial service (CS) for applications with performance requirements that exceed those of OS; (3)
safety of life (SOL) service for transport applications; (4) public regulated service (PRS) for
governmental application; and (5) search and rescue (SAR) support service.
Galileo signals are to be transmitted on three frequency bands (E5, E6 and L1 bands) using four
carrier frequencies [12].
Fig. 2 Galileo signal spectrum
Two types of subcarrier modulation are to be used: BPSK and binary offset carrier (BOC). The L1 band
signal is free for civilian service. The L1A, L1B, L1C and GPS C/A code signals are listed in Table 1.

The received signal )(tr can be modeled as

where )(tn is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with variance 2 , and the jamming source )(tj
has a bandwidth much smaller than the GPS spreading bandwidth.
The received signal is bandpass filtered, amplified and down converted. Due to the downconversion, the
spectrum of the signal is shifted to the baseband frequency. To further simplify the analysis, we assume
that the received signal passes through a filter matched to the chip waveform and is sampled
synchronously once during each chip interval. The observation

where { )(kS }, { )(kn } and { )(kj } are discrete time sampled waveform of { )(tS }, { )(tn }, and { )(tj },
respectively. They are assumed to be mutually independent. The )(kn can be modeled as band-limited
and white, and the jamming source being considered has a bandwidth much narrower than CT/1 . The
)(kS sequence is )()( kCAkD  taking values of 1.
The low power jamming signal can be suppressed by GPS receivers with the 43dB processing gain (C/A
code). However, if strong jamming signals are present, they can result in degradation of navigation
accuracy or even complete loss of receiver tracking. In this project, five kinds of narrowband interference
will be considered :

where ( )r k is input signal and ( )w n is the window function. In this case, k is discrete and ω is 
continuous, but in most typical applications the STFT is performed on a computer using the Fast Fourier
Transform, so both variables are discrete and quantized. Again, the discrete-time index m is normally
considered to be "slow" time and usually not expressed in as high resolution as time n
3.2 The Wigner Distribution (WD)
The Wigner distribution (WD) [10, 13, 18] that give joint representation in the space and
spatial-frequencey domain, entails a rigorous mathematical framework in the study of thesese local
representatins. The Wigner distyribution is introduced by Wigner as a phase representatin in Qunatum
Mechanics[13] gives a simultaneous representation of signal in space and spatial frequencey variables. It
belongs to a large class of bilinear distributions known as the Cohen’s class.
In this Section, we consider the auto-Wigner distribution function corresponding to 1-D signals for
notational simplicity, being the extension to 2-D signals straightforward. Let suppose a continuous,
integrable and complex function r(t). The symmetric definition of the Wigner distribution  ,gW t  is
given by
     

where t and  are spatial variables,  is the spatial frequency variable and r*(·) means the complex 
conjugate of r(·). The product function fr ( , )t  is given by
   *fr ( , ) / 2 / 2t r t r t      (14)
The auto-Wigner distribution gives a generalized autoconvolution at non-zero frequency. From (14), it
can be observed that the WD is the Fourier transformation, for a given point , of the image product
r(·)r*(·). It may also be obtained from the Fourier transform, F()of r(·) by
      0*0 0 0, / 2 F / 2 j tFW t F e d     


     (15)
According to (13) and (15) the following relation is observed
   f t, = ,FW W t  (16)
which shows the symmetry between the two conjugate domains (space and spatial-frequency). The
mathematical foundations of the WD were considered by De Bruijn [20] in the context of Quantum
Mechanics applications. However they can be modified in many instances to the field of signal
processing.
The Wigner Distribution is closely related with the Ambiguity Function (AF) in the study of radar
signals, which definition is given by
     *f 1A ,t r t / 2 t / 22

Both Eq. (13) and (15) could be considered particular occurrences of the generalized local spectral signal
representation complex-spectrogram (CS), defined by
11
mode decomposition (EMD) that makes the data decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode
functions (IMF) which contain important information. This decomposition process is a time domain
algorithm, and is based on the local characteristics of the signal. In other words, the different signal has
different intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The obtained IMFs are then processed by Hilbert Transform to
create the analytical signals. Then, the instantaneous frequency of the data can be calculated by the
differentiation of phase of IMFs. In fact, estimating instantaneous frequency is the key part of the
application of HHT. In the paper, we will analysis GPS signals offended by FM interference. Through
empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) are obtained.
Among them, the largest energy IMF is FM interference. It is then removed from the original signal [2].
It is known that for a time series x t , the Hilbert-Huang Transform can be described as convolution
with 1
t
which is
 1 xy t d

Then, an analytic data z t can be defined as
    j tz t x t jy t m t e    (23)
Where     

(24)
Moreover, the instantaneous frequency is defined as
 d tF t
dt
 (25)
We should be careful with the instantaneous frequency can be defined only if we restrict a time
series x t to be symmetric locally with respect to the zero mean level. In other words, if an arbitrary
time series has undesired fluctuation or if it has biases in time domain, the data must be pre-processed
before doing the Hilbert Transform to obtain the correct estimated instantaneous frequency.
The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used for pre-processing as described in the previous
paragraph. The resulting signals need to match 2 requirements. First, data series must have the equal
number of extreme and zero crossing or the difference of them must not be larger than one. Second, at
any point, the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the
local minima is zero. Any data series that satisfies the above two conditions is called intrinsic mode
function (IMF). As a result, all the IMFs do not have the undesired fluctuations. They all have the
well-behaved Hilbert transform.
The EMD is, in fact, the procedure to make the original signal meets the IMF requirements. For an
arbitrary time signal ( )x t , to begin with the algorithm, the mean value, named 11( )m t , of the upper
envelope and the lower envelope will be found. Next subtract the mean value from the data set, that is
  11 11n t x t m t  (26)
Furthermore, we will consider whether 11( )n t is an IMF. If it is not, we will go back to the first step and
let 11( )n t be the signal to be analyzed. Finally, until 1 ( )in t is an IMF, we will obtain the first
decomposed function that is defined as
 1 1imf it n t (27)
and subtract the 1imf ( )t from ( )x t to get the residue 1( )r t . Similarly, let 1( )r t be the data set to be

4. Simulation results
In this section, we will introduce transmitter, channel and receiver in simulation environment.
1. Transmitter
The transmitted spread spectrum signal is
    c2 cos 2s t C t D t f t      (30)
Where D t is the data sequence representing the navigation data from the satellite , C t is the PRN
code sequence representing satellite 1 C/A code and cf representing simulated carrier frequency.
Fig.2. Transmitter model
2. Channel
After GPS signal was transmitted from transmitter, GPS signal superimposed to Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) plus intentional interference. AWGN is simulated as thermal noise, environment
noise and some unintentional wideband interference. Channel model is shown in Fig.3. In the thesis, we
consider that Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Interference to Noise Ratio (INR) are -16.6dB and 33.4dB
in Passband bandwidth of 2MHz, respectively.
Fig.3. Channel model
3. Receiver
In receiver environment, we first make received signal pass through BandPass filter, then apply A/D
converter to translate analog signal to digital data. Furthermore, we apply anti-jamming filter to remove
interference from original signal. Finally, we take the residual signal and synchronous C/A code and
carrier to find out their cross-correlation. The efficiency of anti-jamming approach is verified by
cross-correlation. The Fig.4 shows receiver model. The Anti-Jamming Filter includes HHT analysis and
OFFT analysis.

interference is suppressed. OFFT omit widely spectrum of signal. As a result, spectrum of signal is
destroyed seriously, so it cannot suppress FM interference as showed in Fig 9..
