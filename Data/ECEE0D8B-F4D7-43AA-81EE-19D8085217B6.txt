We propose three dimensionless approximate expressions to predict the thickness filling factor, gap center, and gap
width of the maximum omnidirectional gap (MODG) for various refractive indices in one-dimensional photonic
crystals. These expressions are simple and do not include trigonometric or inverse trigonometric functions. It is
easy to obtain the MODG from given refractive indices but also to estimate the refractive indices from the MODG
based on the results. © 2011 Optical Society of America

Omnidirectional reflection is a total reflection phenom-
enon for arbitrary incident angles and the polarization
of light [1,2]. Recently, omnidirectional reflectors have
been achieved using one-dimensional photonic crystals
(PhCs) for applications in mirrors, filters, and lasers
[3–8]. Omnidirectional gaps are the frequency ranges
of bandgaps in the PhC for all incident angles and polar-
izations. Studying the relationship between the maximum
frequency range of the maximum omnidirectional gap
(MODG) and the refractive indices of the materials is use-
ful in the design of omnidirectional reflectors [1,2,8–16].
The frequency range of the MODG has been approxi-
mately calculated by using quarter-wave stacks (QWSs).
Based on the QWSs, an approximate analytical expres-
sion for the ratio of gap width to the center of the MODG,
called the range-midrange ratio, has been proposed
[1,2,8,9]. However, each layer thickness at the occur-
rence of the MODG may not be just equal to the quar-
ter-wavelength thickness [10].
An alternative way to determine the frequency range of
the MODG can be achieved by using the gap map di-
agram, in which the overlap range of the photonic band-
gap for normal incidence (NI) and grazing incidence with
TM polarization (TMG) states versus different layer fill-
ing factors is displayed [11,12]. Based on the gap map dia-
gram, the frequency range of the MODG has been
determined by the optimal method [11]. The optical filling
factor, center frequency, and gap width of the MODG
(FFM, CFM, and GWM, respectively), versus the refrac-
tive indices of the practical optical materials have been
represented by graphs obtained by numerical analysis.
However, these results cannot be described by simple
mathematical expressions. Recently, alternative approx-
imate analytical expressions for FFM, CFM, and GWM
have been derived based on the gap map diagram [12].
Unfortunately, these proposed expressions include the
trigonometric or inverse trigonometric functions of the
refractive indices [1,2,8–12]. It is valuable to understand
not only the variation of the refractive indices of the basis
layers of the PhC to the induced MODG but also the
wanted frequency range of the MODG relative to the re-
quired refractive indices of the layers for design. How-
ever, it is difficult to straightforwardly obtain the
refractive indices and thicknesses for a required MODG,
specified by the gap center and gap width, using the
formulas in [1,2,8,9,12].
In this study, we find that the FFM, CFM, and GWM can
be approximately expressed by simple linear relations
with the refractive indices of materials based on suitable
selection of new variables of the refractive indices.
Errors obtained by the proposed formulas are calculated
and compared with other approximation expressions
[2,12] to show the feasibility of the proposed method.
Based on the proposed equations, it is easy to understand
the relationship between the frequency range of the
MODG and the refractive indices of materials.
We consider a one-dimensional PhC composed of bin-
ary layers A and B with refractive indices nA and nB, re-
spectively, nA < nB. It is assumed that the material is
optically isotropic for both layers. Reflection of light
from the vacuum to the PhC is dependent on the fre-
quency and incident angle. The frequency range of light
forbidden in the PhC can be represented by the band
structures, which are represented by the normalized fre-
quency Ω versus the normalized wave vector k== defined
by Ω ¼ ωD=ð2πcÞ and k== ¼ k0neD=2π with D ¼ dA þ dB,
where ne is the effective refractive index. The MODG can
be determined by overlap of the forbidden band in the NI
and TMG states. The bandgaps for each of the NI and
TMG states depend not only on the effective refractive
index but also the thickness of the basic layers. Thus,
the relationship between the bandgaps and the filling fac-
tor of the basic layers F , defined by F ¼ dA=D, has been
described by the bandgap map, as shown in Fig. 1. To
avoid numerical instability, the edges of each bandgap
in the gap map diagram are calculated by the band edge
equation [7,12].
The gap map for each of the NI and TMG states can be
divided by the half-wave lines, kAdA ¼ pπ and kBdB ¼ pπ
to several regions, in which p and q are integers. The re-
gion bounded by kAdA ¼ pπ, kAdA ¼ ðpþ 1Þπ, kBdB ¼ qπ,
and kBdB ¼ ðqþ 1Þπ is called region (p; q). There is only
one bandgap in each region. The maximum gap of each
state occurs in the region with the lowest frequency,
region (0,0). The greatest gap width for the NI state oc-
curs almost as the filling factor passes the center of the
gap hole in region (0,0), (F ðNIÞc ;ΩðNIÞc ), which is the inter-
section of the quarter-wave lines kAdA ¼ 0:5π and

Figure 3(c) shows that the errors of CFM obtained by
the proposed method can be reduced to less than 3%,
which is less than the errors obtained by the traditional
method [2].
As the filling factors for the maximum gaps in the re-
gions of the NI and TMG states are very close, the GWM,
denoted byGWðOmniÞc , is generally approached by using the
difference between the normalized frequencies of the top
edge of the maximum gap in the NI state and the bottom
edge of the maximum gap in the TMG state. If the mid and
maximum gaps for the NI and TMG states are very close,
the GWM can be approximately expressed by [12]
GWðOmniÞc ¼ ΩðNIÞc − ΩðTMGÞc þ 0:5ðGWðNIÞc þ GWðTMGÞc Þ
þΔS; ð4Þ
where ΔS is the correction slope. Because the right and
left ends of the gap hole in region (0,0) for theNI states are
very close to the ones for the TMG states, the correction
slope can be neglected when calculating the GWM,
ΔS ≈ 0. The first two terms on the right-hand side of
Eq. (4) can be expressed as 0:25n−1A ½ð1þ α1Þ − ð1þ
βAβ−1B α1Þ and approximated by 0:25n−1B ðδA − δBÞ. More-
over, GWðNIÞc andGW
ðTMGÞ
c are themidgapwidths in region
(0,0) for the NI and TMG states, given by ð1þ
α1Þ sin−1ΔðNIÞS =ðπnAÞ and ðβ−1A þ α1β−1B Þ sin−1ΔðTMGÞS =
ðπnAÞ, respectively, where ΔðNIÞS ¼ ð1 − α1Þ=ð1þ α1Þ and
ΔðTMGÞS ¼ ðβAβ−1B − α1Þ=ðβAβ−1B þ α1Þ. Because 0 < ΔðNIÞS ,
ΔðTMGÞS < 1, sin−1Δ
ðNIÞ
S , and sin
−1ΔðTMGÞS , Eq. (4) can be
approximated by GWðOmniÞc ¼ ðnB − nAÞ=πnAnB þΔW ,
where ΔW ¼ðδA −δBÞ½ð2nBÞ−1 − ðπnAÞ−1þðnB −nAÞ2×
ðnAþnBÞ−1. Figure 4(a) shows the relationships between
GWðOmniÞc and ðnB − nAÞ=πnAnB for differentnA. In the con-
sidered region, the gap width for a constant nA can be
fitted well by a straight line with an nA-dependent slope
ΔWS and offset ΔWO. Thus the gap width for a constant
nA can be rewritten as
GWðOmniÞc ¼ nB − nAπnAnB
ð1þΔWSÞ þΔWO; ð5Þ
where ΔWS ¼aWSn−2A þbWS , ΔWO ¼aWOn−4A þbWO, aWS ¼
1:22, bWS ¼ −0:01, aWO ¼ −0:53, and bWO ¼ −0:005.
Figure 4(b) shows the errors produced by the proposed
method in the considered region. We see that the error
of the GWM obtained by the proposed method is less than
2%, which is less than the errors obtained by the tradi-
tional method [2]. This indicates that the use of derived
expressions to approximately represent CFM and GWM
is reasonable.
In summary, the thickness filling factor, gap center,
and gap width of the MODG of the PhC can be predicted
by expressions (1) and (5), described by the FFM, CFM,
and GWM versus the refractive indices, for a bilayer PhC.
For most practical optical materials, we find that the
errors of the proposed expressions of the FFM, CFM,
and GWM are 10%, 3%, and 2%. Based on the proposed
results, it is convenient to understand not only the influ-
ence of the refractive indices of the basis layers on the
induced MODG, but also the wanted MODG relative to
the required refractive indices of the layers for design.
Compared to other traditional expressions, we see that
the proposed expressions are more efficient and reason-
able to find the materials for the required frequency
range of an MODG.
