of leaf hinges also include two dimensional [11~12] and three 
dimensional positioning applications [13].   
The analysis of compliant mechanisms, unlike rigid-body 
mechanisms, relies on a sophisticated model that precisely 
describes the kinematics of a nonlinearly deflected link. The 
pseudo-rigid-body model [4] finds the equivalent spring 
stiffness of a deflected link so that a compliant mechanism can 
be analyzed like a rigid-body mechanism. It is a lumped-
parameter model that best used to predict the deflection of 
compliant member with definite geometry (such as the notch 
hinge and leaf hinge). For a compliant member with more 
complicated shape, distributed-parameter models are required. 
They include the elliptical integral [14], the finite element 
method (FEM) [15], and the generalized shooting method [16].   
Since a compliant mechanism is essentially an elastic 
continuum, its design is similar to structural optimization [17] 
and hence can be defined into three hierarchical levels [4]. 
Topology is the highest level that determines the form 
(input/output ports and how different links are connected) of 
the mechanism. Once a topology is selected, the shape of each 
link needs to be optimized. Finally the size (thickness and 
width) has to be considered. Two approaches have been 
developed recently to design the topology of a compliant 
mechanism, namely, the continuum-element based approach 
[18~21] and the frame-element based approach [22~23]. They 
apply continuum finite elements and frame (or truss) elements 
to construct the topology, respectively. Both methods can 
determine the shape and size at the same time. However, the 
optimized topology usually consists of a few flexural hinges 
while the rest of the mechanism is rigid. This causes local stress 
concentration since they do not take advantage of the 
distributed compliance of a compliant segment [24]. In 
addition, high resolution (and thus larger problem size) is 
required for both approaches in order to obtain smooth shapes. 
An alternative design approach is to find an equivalent rigid 
body model (say, by using the pseudo-rigid-body model) for the 
compliant mechanism. Thus various design methods built for 
rigid mechanisms can be directly applied to their compliant 
counterparts. To make this possible, notch hinges are usually 
used since they can be easily replaced by two rigid links with 
one torsional spring. However, the compliance is lumped at the 
notch and hence stress concentration still needs to be avoided. 
Without an amplifying device, a compliant mechanism 
designed by the above approaches is limited by its deflection 
range. Hence there is a need to increase the deflection range to 
further exploit the merits of compliant mechanism. Since stress 
concentration is the main issue, some design methods have 
been proposed recently to distribute the material continuously 
over a compliant link. Hetrick and Kota [24] proposed a design 
method by varying movable nodes and the cross-sectional area 
of straight links. To explore the variations of link shape, splines 
(such as Bezier curves and basis splines) [25] are often used. 
Their ability to model curves with free-form shapes has made 
them attractive in designing the shape of compliant 
mechanisms. Xu and Ananthasuresh [26] used Bezier curves to 
describe the shape of a compliant mechanism. This approach 
was later improved [27] by using wide (fat) Bezier curve theory 
to account for link thickness. The advantages of Bezier curves 
are that the shape of the link always lies in the convex hull 
formed by control points. On the other hand, additional 
constraints are required to avoid cusps and intersecting loops.  
To further exploit the advantages gained from shape variation 
of compliant mechanisms, a shape design method is proposed 
in this paper to offer the following: 
1. Given (partially) the topology, a method that parameterizes 
the distributed shape using intrinsic functions will be 
presented to design compliant mechanisms. 
2. The generalized multiple shooting method (GMSM) will be 
developed to effectively analyze the deformation that is 
required when designing a compliant mechanism. 
3. Three examples are given to illustrate the proposed design 
method for a variety of applications. Convergence study will 
be shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of using intrinsic 
functions. Advantages of the proposed method are 
highlighted by comparing compliant mechanisms with 
various shapes.   
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
This section first introduces intrinsic functions to 
parameterize the shape of a link within a compliant mechanism. 
This is followed by objective functions and constraints that 
form the optimization problem. 
2.1 Parameterization Using Intrinsic Functions  
Consider a planar compliant link shown in Fig. 1. It has an 
initially varying angle of rotation and lateral thickness in the x 
and y direction. The link is characterized by a non-dimensional 
arc length u אሾ0 1ሿ along its neutral axis. The geometric shape 
can be described by angle of rotation η(u) and lateral thickness 
w(u). These two functions are here referred as the intrinsic 
functions since they together determine the appearance and 
performance of the link. For a particular point (x, y) on the 
neutral axis, there are two corresponding points ሺݔℓ, ݕℓሻ and 
 ሺݔ௥, ݕ௥ሻ on the left and right surfaces of the link, respectively. 
Without loss of generality, the link is assumed to have constant 
out-of-plane thickness d (along the z axis), hence the moment 
of area I (in the z direction) of the link is related to the lateral 
thickness w by I(u) = [w(u)]3d/12.

functions of a straight line or a curve. By imposing the 
constraints in Eq. (6), the entire shape of the ith link 
(represented by its control points) will be enclosed by boundary 
functions fi and fi+1. Hence function fi+1 prevents the ith and the 
(i+1)th links from intersecting each other. Similarly the 
function fi+2 prevents intersecting of the (i+1)th and the (i+2)th 
links, and so on. Though more control points would better 
describe the shape variation, five to ten segments (M=5~10) are 
sufficient to avoid intersections among links. 
 
Fig. 3 Control points and design domain 
To ensure that the optimized shape can be fabricated, 
additional constraints can be included to regulate the radius of 
curvature (ߩሺݑሻ ൌ ܮ/ߟᇱ) at specified location (say, to fit cutting 
tool). These constraints, however, may not be easily accounted 
for at the topology synthesis level.  
3 DEFORMATION ANALYSES 
The generalized shooting method (GSM) was proposed by 
Lan and Lee [16] to efficiently predict the deformed shape of a 
curved compliant mechanism. This method treats a boundary 
value problem (BVP) as an initial value problem (IVP) by 
providing guesses to the unknown initial values of a BVP. The 
method is adopted here with an improved technique called the 
multiple shooting to further ensure convergence of the GSM. 
We first presented the multiple shooting in Section 3.1. This is 
followed by applications to analyzing compliant mechanisms 
that have variable shapes and cross sections.  
3.1 Generalized Multiple Shooting Method (GMSM) 
Consider the following system of l  coupled, normalized 
sets of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations:

T
1 2[ ]i i i inq q q=q L is the ith state vector; /i id du′ =q q ; 
and iξ is the corresponding vector of r unknown 
parameters.  
For compliant mechanisms, each set of Eq. (7) governs the 
deformation of one compliant link. To apply multiple shooting, 
Eq. (7) is decomposed by dividing the interval of integration [0 
1] into N equally-spaced subintervals with N+1 points:  
0 10 1j Nu u u u= < < < < < =L L ; 0j N= L  
A single shooting method is performed in each subset of qi (as 
shown in Fig. 4(a)) so that the resulting solution segments are 
pieced together to form a continuous function over [0 1] (as 
shown in Fig. 4(b)).  
Fig. 4 Multiple shooting method 
Since shooting is performed more than once in the overall 
interval, the method is called multiple shooting. It is also called 
parallel shooting [30] because shooting method is performed 
independently on each subinterval.  
Similar to single shooting, each subinterval of the multiple 
shooting requires an initial set of values in order to integrate the 
ODE’s represented in Eq. (7). The initial values of each 
subinterval are denoted as

Fig. 6 Schematic of a compliant gripper 
Gripper design usually requires maximizing output 
displacement ∆x or output force Fout given a specified input 
force Fin. These two cases are considered respectively as 
follows. 
Case I - maximize output displacement: For clarity, we first 
consider variations due to η(u) and treat the cross-section  of 
links as uniform (w=constant). The optimization problem can 
then be formulated as

(12)
The coefficients c10~c1m and c20~c2m describe the first and 
second links, respectively. Hence there are 2(m+1) design 
variables for the gripper problem. Constraints g1~g6 are to 
prevent the links from exceeding pre-specified design domains. 
Constraints g7~g8 are to avoid self-intersection for each link. 
The last constraint g9 is to ensure that the stress caused by 
deformation lies within the material’s limit, where the stress σm 
is the maximum stress and σy is the yield stress of the material. 
The gripper is made of Polypropylene with E=1.4GPa and 
σy=34MPa. A safety factor SF=1.67 is set in this case. The 
maximum stress σm is computed from ߪ௠ ൌ ܧݓሺ߰ᇱ െ ߟᇱሻ/4ܮ. 
In this case both links have moment of area I = 1.042x10-
10m4. The initial guesses to the shapes are chosen as η1 = 1.26 + 
1.83u–2.46u2 and η2 = 4.40 + 0.082u + 1.80u2. With an input 
force Fin=12N, the optimal shapes with m=2 is obtained and 
shown in Fig. 7. The optimal intrinsic functions are η1 = 2.62 – 
3.57u + 1.61u2 and η2 = 5.15–2.95u + 4.08u2 with L1=19.43cm 
and L2=12.74cm. The optimization is realized by using 
Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) in MATLAB®. As 
shown in Fig. 7, the method tempts to take the best advantage 
of the space within design domain. At the same time, each link 
shape that represented by ten control points (M=10) will not 
exceed the design boundaries. 
Table 1 shows the output displacement of the gripper when 
using polynomials with various number of terms. Fig. 8(a~c) 
show the optimal shapes of m=1, 3, and 5, respectively. For 
m=0, it corresponds to two straight beams. One connects n1 and 
n2 and the other connects n2 and n3. For m=1, arcs appear (such 
as the link in Fig. 2(b)). As the number of terms increases, the 
convergence trend can be expected from the optimal shape and 
its corresponding output displacement. Note that under the 
same load, the maximum displacement ∆x for straight beams 
(m=0) is 1.40 cm, which is less than half of that optimized by 
using m=5 (∆x=3.139cm). This indicates that the variation of 
shapes can significantly increase the output displacement.

Case II - maximize output force: To show the effect of 
varying both η(u) and w(u), case II aims to maximize the output 
force Fout given the same gripper shown in Fig. 6. The input 
force, material properties, and other geometric parameters are 
identical as case I. When further accounting for the coefficients 
d10~d1k and d20~d2k, the objective function is reformulated as 
follows:  
max 10 1 20 2 10 1 20 2( , , , , , , , , , , , )out m m k kF c c c c d d d dK K K K  (13)
Hence there are 2(m+k+2) design variables. The constraint 
functions are the same as Eq. (12) except that the width of the 
links are limited to 5mm < w < 10mm. The optimal output 
forces when using intrinsic functions with m=5 and k=0~5 are 
shown in Table 2. Figures 9(a~c) show the optimal shapes of 
k=1, 3, and 5, respectively. It can be seen that with more terms,

The maximum rotation θ∆ of the platform is 2.73° (before 
yield) for the straight beam parallel mechanism, which is less 
than half of the one shown in Fig. 13. This indicates that by 
changing the shape, the working range of a compliant 
mechanism can be effectively enhanced.

4.3 Example III: Monolithic Stapler 
We design a monolithic stapler in this example for further 
illustration. The stapler incorporates two compliant segments in 
order to generate the stapling motion. As shown in Fig. 15, the 
compressive U-spring is used to hold the strip of staples in 
place before clinching. The flexural pivot connects the upper 
lever arm and lower anvil of the stapler. It provides the return 
force for the stapling motion. Figure 16(a) schematizes the 
compressive U-spring. It consists of periodic compliant 
segments connected in serial. Due to symmetry, only half of the 
first period needs to be considered. The design domain is set so 
that two adjacent periods don’t intersect each other. Two links 
are employed here to model the segment that starts from n1 to 
n3. Their intrinsic functions are denoted as η11, w11 and η12, w12, 
respectively. They also have to be C1 continuous at node n2. 
Two periods of U-spring are used in this example. Figure 16(b) 
also shows the schematic of the flexural pivot. Its intrinsic 
functions are denoted as η2 and w2.

The objective here is to minimize the stress within the 
compliant segments in order to improve durability of the 
stapler. The displacement loads are Din1=8mm and Din2=25mm. 
The material properties are E=2.4GPa (RenShape® SL 7580) 
with out-of-plane thickness d1= 4.9mm and d2=18.5mm. The 
boundary points of the design domains are (xRB1, yUB1) = (5.04, 
4.45)mm and (xLB2, yUB2) = (20, 25)mm. The length of the upper 
lever and lower anvil are L=50mm. Using polynomials with 
m=k=5, the resulting optimal intrinsic functions are listed in 
Table 3.

pivot are w10=0.4mm and w20=1mm, respectively. The optimal 
original shapes and their deformation are shown in Fig. 17. The 
maximum stresses of the U-spring and pivot are 
σ1,max=48.3MPa and σ2,max=9.82MPa. They occur in locations 
indicated by the dotted circles as shown. The variation of 
thickness, though not obvious, does exist.

一、參加會議經過 
The purpose of this trip is to present a research paper in the 2007 International Design 
Engineering Technical Conference held in Las Vegas, USA. The title of my paper is “Distributed 
Shape Optimization of Compliant Mechanisms Using Intrinsic Functions”. The abstract of this 
paper is provided as follows. 
A compliant mechanism transmits motion and force by deformation of its flexible members. It 
has no relative moving parts and thus involves no wear, lubrication, noise, or backlash. Compliant 
mechanisms aims to maximize flexibility while maintaining sufficient stiffness so that satisfactory 
output motion may be achieved. When designing compliant mechanisms, the resulting shapes 
sometimes lead to rigid-body type linkages where compliance and rotation is lumped at a few 
flexural pivots. These flexural pivots are prone to stress concentration and thus limit compliant 
mechanisms to applications that only require small-deflected motion. To overcome this problem, a 
systematic design method is presented to synthesize the shape of a compliant mechanism so that 
compliance is distributed more uniformly over the mechanism. With a selected topology and load 
conditions, this method characterizes the free geometric shape of a compliant segment by its 
rotation and thickness functions. These two are referred as intrinsic functions and they describe the 
shape continuously within the segment so there is no abrupt change in geometry. Optimization 
problems can be conveniently formulated with cusps and intersecting loops naturally circumvented. 
To facilitate the optimization process, a numerical algorithm based on the generalized shooting 
method will be presented to solve for the deflected shape. Illustrative examples will demonstrate 
that through the proposed design method, compliant mechanisms with distributed compliance will 
lessen stress concentration so they are more robust and have a larger deflected range. It is expected 
that the method can be applied to design compliant mechanisms for a wide variety of applications. 
This paper presents a shape (and thus size) optimization method. We are aiming to overcome 
some of the drawbacks of existing shape design methods so that the advantages gained from shape 
variation can be further exploited. In summary, this paper offers the following: 
1. Given (partially) the topology, a method that parameterizes the distributed shape using intrinsic 
functions will be presented to design compliant mechanisms. This method takes into account
