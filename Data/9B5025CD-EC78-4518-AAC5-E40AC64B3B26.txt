hodograph.  That is, if the curve is , and its derivative is 
 then the length of the derivative is polynomial. 
A PH has many properties, among them polynomial arc length, rational curvature and rational 
offset [12].  Moreover, the cyclographic map [6] of a PH has a polynomial form.  From [7] we 
recall the following:   
2.1. Planar PH Boundary 
Definition 1: (Complex representation) [10] 
A PH curve in the complex plane is a complex valued polynomial curve r(t) of the form 
  There must exist a complex polynomial , such that 
the hodograph is  
Although the hodograph so defined is in the complex plane, we can map the real and imaginary 
parts into the Cartesian x and y coordinates, respectively.  Thus, the hodograph of the PH curve 
 can be represented as  ,  so that the 
polynomial (t) has the form

Given two polynomial u(t) and v(t) of degree μ in Bernstein-Bézier form, where

Theorem 2: (PH curve in Bézier form) 
For the hodograph r’(t) in  
 
Theorem 1, the corresponding PH curve is a polynomial curve of degree 2+1. Given the choice

vector field of a PH curve in Bernstein Bézier form as:

 where the control 
points qk are qk=[-Jk,Ik,Hk],, for k = 0... 2, and the Ik and Jk are as in the theorem.  The B(t) and 
V(t) of Definition 4 define the ruled surface S(s,t)=B(t)+sV(t) which has inclination angle of 45 
degrees with the xy-plane. The ruled surface is the -map for B(t) with formula 
(B(t))=B(t)+sV(t)=[x(t)-sy’(t)),y(t)+sx’(t), s(t)].  
For a planar PH curve B(t) on the Z=0 plane, every point (x,y,z) on the rotated normal vector field 
of B(t) is associated with a cycle tangent to B(t) on the Z=0 plane that is compatibly oriented with 
the curve. The cyclographic map for a set of 2D boundaries is a set of ruled surfaces. We can find 
the Medial Axis Transform (MAT) of those boundaries by restricting the ruled -map surfaces to 
the segments of the generators between the Z=0 plane and the first singularity of the surface. 
Then the end points of the segments are points on the MAT [2].  The MAT for a PH curve B(t) 
with a ray can be found in general by intersecting a ruled surface and a plane; the MAT for a PH 
curve B(t) with a cycle similarly can be transformed to the problem of intersecting a ruled surface 
and a cone.

Example 1: (The CP problem) 
Let C be the cycle x2+y2-(-10)2=0 in the z=0 plane. The oriented radius is -10, (C) is a cone 
x2+y2-(z-(-10))2=0. For the planar PH curve B(t), whose initial value are (u0,u1)=(10,3), 
(v0,v1)=(2,-1),p0=(-20,-30,0),  it generate p1=(12,-50/3,0), p2=(68/3,-18,0), p3=(76/3,-20,0), and 
q0=(-40,96,104), q1=(4,32,28), q2=(6,8,10). The MAT for B(t) and C is the intersection curve of 
(B(t)) and (C). By Theorem 5, the MAT is a rational Bézier curve of degree 8, and its control 
points rk and the associated weights wk. listed in  
Table 1.  Figure 1 shows the circle and PH curve in 2D on the left with the associated bisector.  
To the right we see the cyclographic maps of the circle and the PH curve.  Their intersection 
projects to the bisector curve.

4m+4 columns, where m is the degree of L(t), ni is the degree of Bi(t), i=1,2. After this process, 
he finds the implicit form with degree n0+n1. For the implicitization of the cyclographic map of 
PH curves, we can generate the system of equations via B(t)·L(t)=0 and [B(t)+V(t)]·L(t)=0, 
which is equivalent to generating the system of equations for       B(t)·L(t)=0 and V(t)·L(t)=0.  
By Sederberg’s work, the degree of the implicit form is the sum of the degrees of B(t) and of V(t), 
which is 2n-1. 
 
Note that the plane L(t) passing through B(t) has a normal perpendicular to V(t), which is also 
perpendicular to the a generators of S(s,t). 
To determine the degree of the cyclographic map, we can compute the implicit form.  We find 
the Gröbner Basis for the polynomial set F: [X−Bx(t)−sVx(t), Y−By(t)−sVy(t), Z−sVz(t)] w.r.t. the 
lexicographic order with s>t>X>Y>Z. The Gröbner Basis of F will then contain the implicit form 
of the cyclographic maps of PH curves. 
Example 2: Consider the PH curve whose initial value are (u0,u1) = (1,5), (v0,v1) = (5, 1), p0 = (18,-52/3). 
Then the implicit form of its cyclographic map is of degree 5: 
F(X,Y,Z,W) = 144(X5-3X4Z+X3Y2+2X3Z2-3X2Y2Z+2X2Z3+3XY2Z2-3XZ4-Y2Z3+Z5)

3.3. The algebra of PP 
 
To simplify the description, we denote all of functions of the base curve and vector field without 
their parameter. That is, xi means xi(ti), and the notation for, Bi, Vi, yi,  i, x’i, y’i is analogous. 
Theorem  8:  Let Bi=(xi, yi, 0), i=1,2, be two base curves and let Vi=(-yi’, xi’,  i) be the vector 
fields of the cyclographic maps of two PH curves. That is, (Bi)=Bi+siVi, i=1,2. Then the 
intersection of these two surfaces satisfies: 
f(t1,t2) =  =  = 0 
Furthermore, the parametric form of the intersection points [X,Y,Z] under above restriction is: 
                   
Proof:  The theorem can be proved easily by the algebraic property of PH curves, namely [X,Y] 
= [x1,y1] +Z*[-y1’/1, x1’/1] = [x2,y2]+Z*[-y2’/2, x2’/2].  The Z value can be found by 
eliminating X and Y, and the function f(t1,t2) can be found by eliminating Z. After finding Z, X

Example 3[CPP problem]: Consider the circle C and one PH curve P1, the entities of Example 1, and the 
PH curve P2 defined in Example 2. We can find the circle tangents to these three geometric entities by 
intersecting their cyclographic maps. We plug the intersection curve found in Example 1 into the implicit 
form found in Example 2, and obtain a degree 36 equation with one variable.  After solving this equation, 
it takes less one second in Maple to find 8 real solutions, -1.489, 0.386, 1.089, 1.090, 1.503, 1.547, 2.380, 
4.139. There is only one solution in the range from 0 to 1, so we obtain just one circle with radius 6.018, 
centered at (6.906,-14.453), as shown in Figure 2.  Again, the spatial image shows the intersecting 
cyclographic maps. 
 
     
Figure 2: The CPP problem of Example 3.  The Apollonius circle is shown in black. 
Note that if the circle is not centered at the origin, we can always translate all three geometric 
entities, so that the center of the circle is at the origin. After we find the solutions, the inverse 
translation recovers the true solution. The translation of the p0 in the PH curve translates the 
whole PH curve since the other control points are derived from p0. 
 
3.5. The algebra of PPP 
 
Theorem  9:  Let Bi=(xi, yi, 0), i=1,2,3, be two base curves and let Vi=(-yi’, xi’, ) be the vector fields 
of the cyclographic maps of two PH curves. The intersection of these two surfaces satisfies: 
f1(t1,t2) =  = 0,        f2(t1,t3) =  = 0,  
and  
12 
Moreover, if we are to restrict to solutions in the parametric range [0,1], or any other domain, 
many of the equation roots obtained algebraically will not qualify.  For example, we expect only 
one common circle tangent to the three curves in Figure 3, yet the algebraic degrees of the two 
equations in (s3, t3) are 15 each, so that we should expect finding up to 225 roots.  Because of 
such considerations, we investigate a solution method that is both quick and immune to finding 
solutions that lie outside the region of interest.  We describe a solution method next that exploits 
the highly parallel nature of sampling and the capability of graphics hardware to evaluate such 
samplings rapidly.  Briefly, we will render the tessellated cyclographic maps by hardware and 
use the z-buffer to extract intersections of the various surfaces.  This is not a new idea, and an 
example of using this approach to compute Voronoi diagrams of points, line segments and 
polygons has been presented in [22].

P3 (1,5) (5,1) [18, -52/3] [10,-14] [10,-16/3] [18,-2] Example 2
 
Our approach is to approximate the cyclographic map by a tessellation of the appropriate 
accuracy, render the approximations in a raster of, say, 1000x1000 pixels, and then extract the 
intersection points from the graphics hardware.  Those points can then be used directly, or else 
we can use them as starting points for further refinement such as Newton iteration or other 
14

The control poly-arcs of the PH curves are drawn in light grey. 
4.2. Basic Algorithm and Results 
Given the three planar shape elements for which we wish to solve the Apollonius problem, we 
discretize them into connected segments.  The facets of the cyclographic map are generated as 
explained.  All facets belonging to one of the shape elements are colored with a specific color, in 
our examples red, green and blue.  They are then rendered using flat shading.  A shader code 
fragment is applied next that notes all pixels adjacent to a differently colored pixel and colors it 
white, so accentuating the medial axis of two of the three shapes.  Moreover, pixels adjacent to 
two or more other colors are the sought solution points and are likewise noted.  The coordinates 
of the intersections are printed to the console, but could be used instead for a subsequent 
refinement computation.  Assuming a raster of 1000x1000 pixels and a normal separation of no 
more than 3.6 degrees, we expect to obtain the points with a relative accuracy of the results of 
10-3, a good initial guess for a possible subsequent Newton iteration. 
In the examples we show, the two-sided cyclographic map is used.  That is, a shape element is 
considered in both direction and only the positive part of the cyclographic map is used.  End 
points are capped with half cones.  When using the one-sided distance function only, there are 
undefined distance regions outside the parametric domain, past the end of a PH curve, and no end 
caps.  Likewise, the interior of circles has no distance information, or the exterior does not, 
depending on the circle orientation. Since the signed, negative distance function must be clipped, 
those regions reveal the interaction of the positive part of the cyclographic maps of other shape 
elements beyond the distance function.  An example is shown in Figure 6 on the left. 
16 
 
Figure 7:  Distance maps of multiple objects including non-PH Bézier curves. 
The accuracy obtained by this approach to solving the generalized Apollonius problem depends 
not only on the accuracy of the tessellation but also on the condition number of intersecting facets.  
Briefly, when the facets of two different shape elements are nearly parallel, then the accuracy of 
determining their intersection declines.  This is primarily a characteristic of the problem, not the 
method.  However, as noted in [22], the graphics hardware determines the intersection by a 
depth sampling using floating-point numbers of only 16 bits.  Inaccuracies are visible in a large 
raster but are usually subtle in appearance.  Figure 8 shows an example: The control points are 
symmetric about the  axis and the two curves meet with tangent continuity at the point 
(-1,-1).  Thus, the cyclographic maps should intersect in the line of symmetry.  The actual 
intersection, however, shows a slight downward slope.  Note that the depth buffer resolution can 
be set to 32 bit floats.  This is helpful, but it does not solve the fundamentals of the problem. 
 
Figure 8:  Ill-conditioned intersection of the cyclographic maps.   
The red and green curves are symmetric, yet the intersection of the cyclographic maps is not quite. 
4.3. Medial Axis Transform 
The medial axis transform (MAT), e.g., [2], is a restriction of the cyclographic map and can be 
18 
of solutions, and decomposition of the cyclographic map in some of these cases.  We illustrate 
the situation with the classical Apollonius problem and sketch our approach how to deal with it. 
It is well-known that the classical Apollonius problem can be factored into 4 systems of equations, 
each requiring solving only a univariate quadratic equation; e.g., [26].  This can be understood 
by considering two cycles and asking for the locus of all cycles tangent to the two given ones.  
This locus is a conic section, and the different systems are based on different orientations of the 
three cycles which affects the cyclographic maps that must be intersected.   
We observe that we need to account for different cases arising from orientation.  however, this is 
not enough: If we are to find all solutions to the Apollonius problem using hardware assistance, 
as described, then we need to be able to generate the conics of two cycles in their entirety.  The 
problem that arises is that some parts of the conic do not correspond to the global bisector, as 
illustrated in Figure 11.  Here we are looking for cycles tangent to a positive cycle (green) and a 
negative one (red).  The blue cycle is an example of such a cycle, but the part of the hyperbolic 
arc on which its center is found is obscured by the lower part of the green cone.  Thus, we 
cannot find all solutions of the Apollonius problem without separate rasters rendering the 
sub-cases.  See also Figure 12 (left). 
      
Figure 11:  Hyperbolic locus of the centers of all cycles tangent to negative red and positive green cycles. 
Note the missing arc on which the center of the blue example solution lies. 
     
Figure 12.  Left: Instance of Apollonius problem requiring decomposition of cyclographic map. 
Right: Depth buffer reversal as an alternative to decomposition for circles. 
We can approach this situation by decomposing the cyclographic map of (positive) cycles into 
two parts: the lower cone, representing the interior distance function, extending from the 
perimeter to the vertex above the center, and the upper cone, beginning at the vertex above the 
center at height equal to the radius and extending upward to infinity.  Since the rendering 
process is so fast, multiple renderings are an attractive solution.  An alternative to 
decomposition, based on the geometry of cyclographic maps, is depth buffer reversal.  Briefly,

不惜耗資採購並字型於該設備上研發一些新的軟體介面來做未來 3D CAD 軟體的輸入/輸出
設備。在輸入設備方面，該公司採購了一個桌面大螢幕(約 52inches)，利用觸摸式的輸入
來做幾何設計。例如說以單指劃直線，三指同時觸摸螢幕則定義一圓，握拳後手摩擦桌面
銀幕則是刪除(擦掉)幾何物件。該硬體為該公司採購，但由公司員工來設計撰寫軟體。另
有一個 3D 印表機(下圖)為 SolidWorks 的輸出設備。如果以 SolidWorks 設計了一個手機，
以該印表機印出，則會產生一個 3D 的手機的模型。 
 
 
 
國科會給予學者此機會參觀國際級的軟體公司，同時與國內業界作比較，可提升學者的視
野。對未來提昇國內軟體工業提升，可有較為先進及中肯的建議，此措施之重要性，不言
而喻。
