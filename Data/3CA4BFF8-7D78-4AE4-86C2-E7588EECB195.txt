問題所進行的研究，分為二個部份：（一）規劃模型定義、以及（二）最佳化問題 
定義。分別說明如下： 
 
(一)  規劃模型定義：  
 網路模型(Network Model)：  
我們假設在一個邊界區域中，給定一群已部署的，固定不動的(stationary)無線感測節點(sensor 
nodes)，負責監控入侵事件資料及/或轉傳資料，而這群節點所形成的集合稱為節點集合(Vs)；也給定一
群已部署的，固定不動的匯集節點(sink node)，負責資料收集與處理，而這群節點所形成的集合稱為匯
集節點集合(Vk)。此外，我們定義一個基於節點集合 Vs 的無向圖 Gc，代表覆蓋圖(coverage graph)用以
表示感測節點所形成的感測範圍的覆蓋重疊關係，以及定義一個基於節點集合 Vs 與匯集節點集合 Vk
的有向圖 Gt，代表傳輸圖(transmission graph)用來表示節點間的傳輸關係(transmission relationships)。以
下我們分別描述覆蓋圖 Gc 與傳輸圖 Gt。我們規劃目標即為挑選出一個最小的 Vb 集合來建構 Barrier 
Coverage，其中，Vb 是由節點集合 Vs中所挑選出來的節點(Vb⊆Vs)，並且，Vb 在 Gc上具有最佳的 barrier 
coverage 偵測能力，而在 Gt 上具有連通到 Vk 的連通性。  
1. 覆蓋圖(Coverage Graph)： 
在一個覆蓋圖 Gc(Vs∪{S, T}, Ec)中，Vs 為節點集合，S 和 T為虛擬節點，Ec代表節點間的覆蓋
範圍重曡關係的無向邊(edge)集合。對於在 Vs 中任兩點 Ni 和 Nj，如果兩點之間覆蓋範圍重曡則存在
一個邊<Ni,Nj>於 Ec集合。另外，Gc中有兩個虛擬節點 S 和 T，分別對應於內側邊界(Inner side)和外
側邊界(Outer side)之外的兩個側邊，對於任何 Vs 中的節點 Ni 而言，若其感測覆蓋範圍與任何一個側
邊相交，則存在一個邊<Ni,S>或<Ni,T>於 Ec 集合。例如圖二即是一個覆蓋圖的實例。我們定義集合 PS 
為一群路徑集合，其中每條路徑起點為虛擬節點 S 而終點為虛擬節點 T的遊歷路徑(traversable path)，
另一方面，請注意一條遊歷路徑(traversable path)亦被視為在流量網路(flow network)中的一個流(flow)[1]。
我們可利用 traversable path 來定義 barrier coverage，在覆蓋圖 Gc中，若 PS 中存在 k 條節點不相交
的 traversable path，則我們稱其具有 k-barrier coverage。在本計畫中，我們用函數#DISJOINT_PATHS(Vr)
來代表在圖 Gc 上由虛擬節點 S 開始經過節點集合 Vr 遊歷到虛擬節點 T的具有節點不相 交性質的
遊歷路徑(node-disjoint traversable path)之個數。舉例而言，在圖二中，在虛擬節點 S 與 T 之間，存在二
條節點不相交的遊歷路徑 S-N1-N2-N3-N4-T 與 S-N5-N6-N7-N8-T，故此圖具 2-barrier coverage性質。
另一方面，對一節點集合 Vr={N1,N2,N3,N4, N5,N6,N7,N8}而言，#DISJOINT_PATHS(Vr)=2。 
 
圖二、覆蓋圖 Coverage Graph ( Gc) 
2. 傳輸圖  (Transmission Graph)  
在一個傳輸圖 Gt(Vs∪Vk, Et)中，Vs 為節點集合，Vk為匯集節點集合，Et 代表節點間傳輸關係的
有向邊集合。對於在 Vs∪Vk中任兩點 Ni 和 Nj，如果節點 Ni 可以正確地傳送訊息至 Nj，則存在一個
有向邊<Ni,Nj>於 Et 集合。我們接下來定義 Gt 上的 sink-connected性質，其定義為：針對子集合 Vb⊆ Vs
而言，若 Vb 的每一個節點都存在一條起點為節點本身而終點為 Vk 中的某一個匯集節點的遊歷路徑
(traversable path)，則稱 Vb在Gt上具有 sink-connected性質。舉例而言，在圖三中顯示具有 sink connected
性質的傳輸圖中的一些遊歷路徑，其中 Vb={N 1,…,N13}, Vk={K1,K2}。

Optimal Node Selection Algorithm (最佳化規劃演算法) 
Given : Vs, Vk, Ec, Et To Find: Vb  
Step1. 依據節點的覆蓋關係建構一覆蓋圖 Gc(Vs, Ec)，指定在 G上每一條邊流容量(flow capacity)為 1
及成本為 0，並在 Gc 上增加虛擬節點 S 及 T  
Step2. 對每一個在 Gc 上有多重 flow-in 和 flow-out 的 節 點 ， 執行Node-disjoint transformation(節
點不相交轉換)，並以轉換的結果產生新的圖 Gc'  
Step3. 在圖 Gc'上執行最大流最小成本演算法(Maximum Flow Minimum Cost Algorithm)，找出一個由 S
到 T的最大流最小成本的 Flow Plan (FP MinCt ) 
Step4. 依據 FP MinCt 建構一傳輸圖 Gt (Vs, Et)，指定在 Gt 上每一條邊流容量(flow capacity)為 1 及
成本為 0，並在 Gc 上增加虛擬節點 S 及 T，以及所有在 FP MinCt 中被選到的節點都會建立一
條由 S 到節點的邊，並且每一個 sink node都會新增一條 sink node到 T的邊 
Step5. 執行 Node-Edge transformation(節點到邊轉換)，將每一個節點(除了 S,T 外)轉換成二個節點和
一個成本為 1的邊，並以轉換的結果產生新的圖 Gt'  
Step6. 在圖 Gt'上執行最大流最小成本演算法(Maximum Flow Minimum Cost Algorithm)，找出一個由 S 
到 T的最大流最小成本的 Flow Plan (FP MCF )，再令 Vb 為 FP MCF 中所選擇到的節點集合 
在 Step 1中，我們將依據節點的覆蓋關係建構一覆蓋圖 Gc(Vs, Ec)，指定在 Gc 上每一條邊其流
容量(flow capacity)為 1 及成本為 0，並在 Gc 上增加虛擬節點 S 及 T。在 Step 2中，對每一個在 Gc 
上有多重 flow-in 和 flow-out 的節點，執行 Node-disjoint transformation (節點不相交轉換)。如圖四所
示，節點 X 被轉換成節點 X'和 X''以及一個 capacity(容量)為 1 且 cost(成本)為 1的邊，並以轉換後
的結果產生新的圖 Gc'。在 Step 3 中:在圖 Gc'上執行最大流最小成本演算法(Maximum Flow Minimum 
Cost Algorithm)，找出一個由 S 到 T 的最大流最小成本的 Flow Plan(FP MinCt)。其中，最大流最小成本演
算法的求解過程實作說明如下，首先，我們針對圖 Gc'執行最大流演算法(Edmonds-Karp algorithm[6])
找出最大流，再利用最小成本流演算法(Minimum Cost Flow algorithm [8])，找出最大流量之最小成本流。
在 Step 4 中:依據 FP MinCt 建構一傳輸圖 Gt (Vs, Et)，指定在 Gt 上每一條邊流容量(flow capacity)為 1 及
成本為 0，並在 Gt 上增加虛擬節點 S 及 T。以及所有在 FP MinCt 中被選到的節點都會建立一條由 S 到
節點的邊，並且每一個 sink node 都會新增一條 sink node 到 T 的邊。在 Step 5 中，每一個節點(除了 S,T
外)將執行 Node-Edge Transformation(節點到邊轉換)，如圖四(b)所示，節點 X 被轉換成節點 X'和 X''以及
一個 capacity(容量)為無窮大且 cost(成本)為 1 的邊，並以轉換的結果產生新的圖 Gt'。在 Step 6 中，針
對 Gt'執行最大流最小成本演算法，再令節點集合 Vb 為執行結果中所找出來的解(flow plan)中所選擇
到的節點。Step 6 的主要動作為執行最大流最小成本演算法(Maximum Flow Minimum Cost Algorithm)，
找出一個由 S 到 T 的最大流最小成本的 Flow Plan (FP MCF )，然後再令 Vb 為 FP MCF 之節點集合。

現在執行完演算法後，我們可以啟動屬於集合 Vb 中的節點，如圖七所示，被啟動的節點負責

圖七、2-Barrier Coverage 及 sink-connectivity的示意圖 
ONSA 主要的執行時間是被 Step 3 和 Step 6 兩步驟所支配。Step 3(或 Step 6)是針對覆蓋圖 Gc' (傳
輸圖 Gt')執行最大流最小成本演算法。最大流最小成本演算法可利用 Edmonds-Karp 最大流量演算法[5]
和最小成本演算法(MinCostFlow)[2]來實作。對於一個節點個數為  V 和邊個數為 E 的圖而言，
Edmonds-Karp 演算法和 MinCostFlow 演算法的時間複 雜度分別為 O(V E2)以及 O(VE2log(V))。因此
ONSA 演算法的時間為 O(Vc*E2c*log(Vc*) + Vt*E2t*log(Vt*))，其中，V c '及 E c '為 G c '的節點個數
和邊個數，以及 V t '及 E t '為 G t '的節點個數和邊個數，故 ONSA 演算法的時間複雜度為多項式執行
時間。

本計畫針對無線感測節點佈置 Barrier Coverage 中一個重要的最佳規劃問題-(Sink-Connected  
Barrier Coverage Optimization Problem:SCBOP)進行探討，其目的為去選擇一群感測節點將 
Barrier Coverage 之穿越偵測能力最大化，並使得感測節點能夠傳送資料到 sink node，且所需
的感測節點數最少。並提出一個同時考慮穿越偵測能力以及具有連接到 sink 節點的連通性的

nodes can remain inactive to save energy and detecting 
nodes can also help forward event notifications of other 
detecting nodes. The first goal is to maximize the degree of 
WSN barrier coverage while minimizing the number of the 
detecting nodes. The second goal is to make detecting nodes 
sink-connected (i.e., to make sure that every detecting node 
can find a path to send intruding event notification to a sink 
node) by adding a minimum number of forwarding nodes. 
When the number of forwarding nodes decreases, the 
collision probability goes down, and the energy 
consumption in transmissions is thus reduced. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Sections 2, we introduce some related work. In Section 3, we 
present the network model and problem definitions. The 
proposed algorithm is described in Section 4 and simulation 
results are reported in Section 5. Finally, conclusion is drawn 
in Section 6. 
 
II. RELATED WORK 
 
The notion of barrier coverage was first introduced by 
Gage in [6] aiming at sensor-based surveillance of the 
boundary barrier to minimize the probability of undetected 
enemy penetration through the boundary barrier. In [10], 
Liu and Towsley defined detectability to be the probability 
that no path exists for an object to penetrate a barrier. They 
also characterize the detectability and showed that if the 
sensor node density is below a critical density, an intruder 
can almost surely find a path to cross the barrier without 
being detected. Wang and Cao in [12] also studied how to 
construct barrier coverage to monitor moving objects in 
camera sensor networks. 
Kumar et al. [9] defined the notion of k-barrier coverage 
for precisely representing a WSN’s ability of intruder 
detection. A WSN is said to have the k-barrier coverage 
property if any intruder crossing the barrier is detected 
successful by at least k sensor nodes. The authors developed 
theorems and proposed a centralized scheme using the 
maximum flow algorithm to determine whether a belt 
boundary region is k-barrier covered or not. Besides, they 
showed that the individual sensors cannot locally decide 
whether a network can form barrier coverage due to the lack 
of the global information. Unlike the algorithm in [9] that 
returns either true or false (0 or 1) for measuring the quality 
of barrier coverage, the method proposed by Chen et al. in 
[4] returns a non-binary value for the measurement. They 
also proposed a method to identify local regions whose 
qualities do not reach the desired level of quality.  
Chen et al. [3] proposed a localized algorithm that 
guarantees the detection of intruders whose trajectory is 
confined to a slice of a belt boundary region. Saipulla et al. 
in [11] studied the barrier coverage of WSNs with line-
based deployment, in which sensors are deployed along a 
line (e.g., sensors are dropped from an aircraft along a given 
path). Balister et al. [2] estimated the reliable node density 
that achieves barrier coverage with s-t connectivity in a thin 
strip with finite length, where s-t connectivity means that a 
connected path exists between the two far ends of the thin 
strip. 
 
III. NETWORK MODEL AND PROBLEM 
FORMULATION 
 
In this section, we first describe the network model and 
then formulate the sink-connected barrier coverage 
optimization problem to be solved in this paper. 
 
A. Network Model 
 
Consider a WSN consisting of many sensor nodes and 
few sink nodes, in which sensor nodes are to form a virtual 
sensor barrier for monitoring a belt region to detect and send 
intruding events to one of the sink nodes. The sensor nodes 
are assumed to be randomly deployed; for example, they 
can be dropped from an aircraft as described in [11]. Each 
sensor node is equipped with a sensing module with a fixed 
sensing range to sense intruders and a communication 
module with a fixed communication range to communicate 
with other sensor nodes or sink nodes. Initially, a sensor 
node performs a bootstrapping task to pin point its location, 
discover its neighboring nodes, and report its information, 
such as the identification and the location, to one of the sink 
nodes. The sink nodes are more powerful than sensor nodes. 
They have more energy, memory, computing power and 
communication capacity. They can communicate with each 
other and with sensor nodes; they can also communication 
with the backend system, which is assumed to have 
unlimited power supply and enormous computing power to 
gather all WSN nodes’ information and perform the 
optimization computation. 
Let Vs and Vk denote the set of sensor nodes and the set 
of sink nodes, respectively. Below, we define a coverage 
graph Gc to represent the sensing area coverage 
relationships of nodes. Moreover, we define a transmission 
graph Gt to represent the nodes’ wireless transmission 
reachability relationships.  
 
(1) Coverage Graph 
 
A coverage graph Gc(Vs{S,T}, Ec) is an undirected 
graph, in which Vs is the sensor node set, Ec is the edge set, 
and {S,T} are two virtual nodes. The edge set Ec represents 
the sensing area coverage overlap relationships. For two 
nodes Ni and Nj in Vs, there exists an edge (Ni, Nj) in Ec if 
Ni’s coverage and Nj’s coverage have overlap. As shown in 
Fig. 2, the monitored belt region has the outer side, inner 
side and lateral sides. Intruders are supposed to cross the 
belt region from outer side to inner side. The virtual nodes S 
and T are associated the lateral sides; an edge (Ni, S) or (Ni, 
IV. OPTIMAL NODE SELECTION ALGORITHM (ONSA) 
 
In this section, we propose an algorithm, called optimal 
node selection algorithm (ONSA), to solve the sink-
connected barrier coverage optimization problem. Given the 
sensor nodes Vs, sink nodes Vk, coverage relationship Ec, 
and transmission relationship Et, ONSA can find the 
detecting node set Vr and the forwarding node set Vt. 
ONSA has three main tasks. The first task is to construct the 
coverage graph Gc and then perform the node-disjoint 
transformation to generate the graph Gc* such that Gc* is a 
flow network [5]. The second task is to find the minimum 
cost maximum flow in Gc*. The third task is to construct 
the transmission graph Gt based on Gc* and to find a flow 
plan by executing the maximum flow minimum cost 
algorithm. The nodes selected in the flow plan will be 
activated for constructing sink-connected barrier coverage. 
The details of ONSA are described below. 
 
Optimal Node Selection Algorithm (ONSA) 
 
Input: Vs, Vk, Ec, Et 
 
Output: Vr and Vt 
 
Step 1: Construct a coverage graph Gc(Vs{S,T}, Ec), 
where S and T are virtual nodes. Each edge in Ec is 
associated with one capacity and zero cost. 
 
Step 2: Execute node-disjoint transformation to transfer Gc 
into the new graph Gc*.  
 
Step 3: Execute the maximum flow minimum cost algorithm 
on Gc* to decide the minimum cost flow plan (FPMinCt), and 
let node set Vr contain the selected nodes in FPMinCt. 
 
Step 4: Construct a transmission graph Gt(VsVk, Et). Add 
a virtual source node S and a virtual target node T into Gt.  
 
Step 5: For each node in Vr on graph Gt, add an edge from 
the virtual source node S it to. For each sink node, add an 
edge from it to the virtual target node. 
 
Step 6: Execute node-edge transformation to convert Gt into 
Gt*.  
 
Step 7: Execute the maximum flow minimum cost algorithm 
to find the minimum cost flow (FPT) on Gt*. Let Vb be the 
set of the nodes selected in FPT. 
 
Step 8: Set Vt=Vb-Vr and return Vr and Vt 
 
In step 1, ONSA constructs a coverage graph Gc with a 
virtual node S and a virtual node T. In step 2, ONSA 
executes the node-disjoint transformation to convert each 
node with multiple inbound flows and multiple outbound 
flows into another form. The purpose of the transformation 
is to make the generated graphs node-disjoint. In the 
transformation, a node X will be transformed into a pair of 
nodes X' and X'' with one capacity and one unity cost (refer 
to Fig. 4 (a) ). 
 
 
 
(a) Node-Disjoint Transformation 
 
(b) Node-Edge Transformation 
Figure 4.  Two transformations of ONSA 
In step 3, ONSA executes the well-known maximum 
flow minimum cost algorithm, which has two procedures. 
The first procedure is to find a maximum flow by executing 
the maximum flow algorithm. The second procedure is to 
execute the minimum cost flow algorithm. The readers are 
referred to [5] and [8] for the procedure details. After 
executing the two procedures on Gc*, a set Vr of detecting 
nodes is obtained. Since the flow is maximized, the number 
of node-disjoint traversable paths is also maximized. 
Moreover, since the cost is minimized, the number of nodes 
in Vr is also minimized. 
In step 4, ONSA constructs a transmission graph 
Gt(VsVk, Et) and adds a virtual source node S and a 
virtual target node T into Gt. In step 5, ONSA adds arcs for 
connecting the virtual source node S and the nodes in Vr. 
Each newly added arc is associated with Cost=0 and 
Capacity=∞. 
In step 6, ONSA converts each node (excluding S and T) 
into two nodes with one arc of Cost=1 and Capacity= by 
the node-edge transformation. Please refer to the Fig. 4(b). 
In step 7, ONSA executes the maximum flow minimum 
cost algorithm on Gt* to decide the minimum cost flow 
(FPT). In this step, the nodes containing in FPT will be added 
into the node set Vb. Since FPT has the minimum cost, the 
number of nodes in Vb will also be minimized. 
In step 8, ONSA returns Vr as the set of detecting nodes 
and returns Vt=Vb-Vr as the set of forwarding nodes. 
Below, we take the WSN in Fig. 3 as an example to 
illustrate the execution of ONSA. In step 1, a coverage 
graph Gc will be constructed. After step 2, the nodes with 
multiple inbound flows and multiple outbound flows are 
transformed by the node-disjoint transformation. The 
transformation results are shown in Fig. 5.

sink-connected property, we again use the maximum flow 
algorithm for GDA to select extra sensor nodes to serve as 
forwarding nodes to make GDA satisfy the property. In this 
way, GDA and ONSA can both achieve the highest-degree 
property and sink-connectivity property of barrier coverage. 
We develop a simulator based on the MATLAB 
software [13] to solve the optimization problem. The 
simulations are conducted in the following settings. The 
sensing area coverage radius is 10m. The wireless 
transmission radius is equal to the coverage radius. All the 
sensors are randomly deployed by different number of 
sensors in a rectangle-shaped area of 100m x 10m. The 
number of sink nodes is 2 and their locations are 
respectively at (
   
 
m, 5m) and (
     
 
m, 5m) relative to the 
left-most and lowest position of the rectangle. 
We compare ONSA and GDA in terms of the number of 
nodes selected to achieve the highest-degreed and sink-
connected barrier coverage. As shown in Fig. 8, ONSA 
selects fewer nodes than GDA for all cases. It implies that 
ONSA needs fewer nodes than GDA to achieve the highest-
degreed and sink-connected barrier coverage. 
 
 
Figure 8.  Comparisons of ONSA and GDA in terms of the number of 
selected nodes 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we studied the sink-connected barrier 
coverage problem to achieve two goals: (1) to maximize the 
degree of barrier coverage using the minimum number of 
detecting nodes and (2) to minimize the number of 
forwarding nodes to hold the sink-connected property. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider 
the sink-connected property and the barrier coverage quality 
optimization at the same time. An optimal network flow 
planning algorithm, called optimal node selection algorithm 
(ONSA), is proposed to solve the problem. ONSA is based 
on the well-known maximum flow minimum cost algorithm. 
We also perform simulation experiments for ONSA and a 
related algorithm called global determination algorithm 
(GDA), which uses the maximum flow algorithm to find out 
the maximum degree of barrier coverage and does not 
consider the sink-connected property. For the sake of 
comparison, the maximum flow algorithm is again used to 
make GDA satisfy the sink-connected property. The 
simulation results show that ONSA is better than GDA in 
terms of number of selected nodes. 
In the future, we plan to study the optimization of barrier 
coverage with sink-node connectivity under the lifetime 
constraint. The lifetime is usually deﬁned as the time span 
from the time of network deployment to the time when a 
certain fraction of sensor nodes run out of their energy. If 
the lifetime of a wireless sensor network is too short, it is 
likely that the network will soon be partitioned and fail to 
deliver the sensed data to sink nodes. The lifetime constraint 
is thus an important factor to be addressed.

=======================================
second by comparing the RSSI values of beacon signals 
received from two perpendicular-orientationed directional 
antennas installed at the same place. In the proposed ALRD, 
we fit RSSI values received from a directional antenna into a 
parabola function of AoA between 0° and 90°. We also set up a 
beacon node with two perpendicular-orientationed directional 
antennas and fit the difference of the signal RSSI values of the 
two antennas into a linear function of the absolute value of one 
AoA between 0° and 90°. By two beacon nodes, ALRD can 
then allow a sensor node to self-localize itself fast (within 0.1s) 
by observing the RSSI values of the beacon signals emitted 
from the two beacon nodes. The fitting functions can easily be 
stored in a WSN node having limited storage space and their 
inverse functions can be used to speed up the localization 
process. Our experiments demonstrate that the average 
localization error is 124 centimeters in a 10m by 10m indoor 
square area. 
We further propose two methods, namely maximum-point-
minimum-diameter (MPMD) and maximum-point-minimum-
rectangle (MPMR), to reduce ALRD localization errors by 
gathering more beacon signals within 1s for finding the set of 
estimated locations of maximum density. Such estimated 
locations are then averaged to obtain the final location 
estimation. The experiment results demonstrate the two 
methods can reduce the average localization error by a factor 
about 29% to be 89 centimeters. ALRD is suitable for mobile 
sensing and actuating applications since it allows a sensor node 
to fast localize itself with small localization errors. 
The rest of this paper is organized as following: We review 
some AoA determination schemes in section II. In section III, 
we describe the proposed localization scheme ALRD in detail. 
Section IV shows our experiment results. Then we describe the 
improvement of ALRD and compare it with other schemes in 
section V. Finally, we conclude the paper in section VI. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
In this section, we review some research about determining 
AoA for localization. The system in [1] uses radio 
interferometric measurement to estimate AoA. The system 
consists of a beacon node and a target node. The beacon node 
is formed by grouping three sensor nodes to from an antenna 
array. The three sensor nodes are arranged in a manner such 
that their antennas are mutually orthogonal. Two of the sensor 
nodes transmit a pure sinusoidal signal at slightly different 
frequencies to create a low-frequency interference signal. The 
other sensor node and the target node both measure the phase 
of the low-frequency signal. The difference in the phase 
readings measured by these two nodes is then used to estimate 
the AoA from the beacon node to the target node. 
EDoA [8] estimates the AoA of an incoming signal by 
using a mechanically actuated parabolic reflector. The receiver, 
fixed to a parabolic reflector which is rotated by a step motor, 
is used to observe the RSSI values of signals emitting from a 
transmitter. When the orientation of the reflector is aligned 
with the direction from the receiver to the transmitter, the 
receiver will observe the highest RSSI value. Hence, the AoA 
can be obtained by searching for the reflector orientation in 
which the highest RSSI values is observed. In RAL [9], a 
beacon node is equipped with a rotatable directional antenna. It 
regularly rotates its antenna to emit beacon signals at different 
direction. A sensor node determines the angle from the beacon 
node to itself by observing the RSSI values of the received 
beacon signals which contain the location of the beacon node 
and the current orientation of its antenna. Similar to EDoA, 
RAL can find out AoA by finding out the strongest signal. 
With the estimated AoAs and locations of two distinct beacon 
nodes, a sensor node can then calculate its own location with a 
localization error of 76cm within a 10- by 10-meter indoor area. 
Two enhanced methods are further proposed to reduce the 
localization error by a factor of 10%. 
III. THE PROPOSED SCHEME 
A. Preliminary 
As shown in Fig. 1, we define AoA as the angle from the 
propagation direction of an incident RF wave to the orientation 
of the directional antenna emitting the RF wave. AoA is 
positive if it is counterclockwise; negative, otherwise. By 
experiment results shown in Fig. 2, we observe that if the 
distance between the sensor node and the directional antenna is 
fixed, RSSI varies like a parabola function of AoA, referenced 
to the orientation of the directional antenna, between 90° and 
90° with a symmetry axis at AoA=0°. Furthermore, we set up 
two perpendicular-orientationed directional antennas installed 
at the same location (refer to Fig. 3). By the experiment results 
shown in Fig. 4, we also observe that the difference of the 
signal RSSI values received by a sensor node locating between 
the orientations of two directional antennas varies like a linear 
function of the AoA absolute value between 0° and 90°. Note 
that we take absolute values of AoAs and that when one AoA 
absolute value is , the other AoA absolute value is 90. We 
then take only one AoA absolute value as the representative 
without ambiguity.

also needs to collect the signal RSSI values R2h and R2v of the 
horizontal and vertical antennas of beacon node B2. 
2. Estimating distance: For each distance kd, k=1, 2,…, M, 
two absolute values of AoAs αkd and βkd corresponding to the 
horizontal and vertical antennas of the beacon node B1 are 
obtained by calculating αkd=Qkd 
1
(R1h) and βkd=Qkd 
1
(R1v), 0°  
αkd, βkd  90°, where Qkd 
1
() is an inverse function of the 
quadratic function Qkd() obtained in RSSI gathering and 
analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, αkd + βkd should ideally be 90. 
Therefore, the sensor node can obtain a rough estimate of the 
distance from itself to the beacon node B1, by finding kd for 
k=1, 2,…, M, such that αkd + βkd is closest to 90°. Let the found 
kd be denoted by kd1. Similarly, by R2h and R2v the sensor node 
can find kd for k=1, 2,…, M, such that kd + kd is closest to 90°, 
where kd and kd, 0°  kd, kd  90°, are two absolute values of 
AoAs corresponding to the horizontal and vertical antennas of 
the beacon node B2, and kd=Qkd 
1
(R2h) and kd=Qkd 
1
(R2v). Let 
the found kd be denoted by kd2.  
3. Estimating AoA: The distance estimate kd1 obtained in 
step 2 is used to choose a proper approximation linear function 
Lkd1 for estimating AoA of the sensor node corresponding to 
the beacon node B1. The AoA corresponding to the horizontal 
antenna of B1 is calculated as αkd1=Lkd1 
1
 (R1h R1v), where Lkd1 
1
 () is the inverse function of the linear function Lkd1 () 
obtained in RSSI gathering and analysis stage. Similarly, by 
kd2 and (R2h R2v), the AoA corresponding to the horizontal 
antenna of the beacon node B2 can be calculated as kd2=Lkd2 
1
 
(R2h R2v).  
4. Calculating location: After obtaining the AoAs αkd1 (or  
for short) and kd2 (or  for short) corresponding to the 
horizontal antennas of the two beacon nodes B1 and B2, the 
sensor node can determine its location (x, y) by calculating 
(       
     
       
  
         
       
 , 0  x, y  D, 
where D is the known distance of B1 and B2. Note that we can 
also calculate by using only kd1 and kd2. However, our 
experiments show that using αkd1 and kd2 results in more 
accurate locations. This explains why ALRD uses R1h, R1v, R2h, 
R2v to calculate kd1 and kd2, uses kd1 and kd2 to calculate αkd1 
and kd2, and then uses αkd1 and kd2 to calculate the location. 
IV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
In this section, we describe the implementation of ALRD 
and the results of the experiments using the implementation. 
A. Implementation 
The sensor nodes and the beacon nodes of the proposed 
ALRD scheme are implemented in the nesC code with TinyOS 
support on the Moteiv BAT mote sensor. The BAT mote 
sensor has Texas Instruments MSP430 F1611 microcontroller 
running at 8MHz with 10k RAM and 48k flash memory. It is 
equipped with Chipcon CC2420 IEEE 802.15.4 compliant 
wireless transceiver using 2.4GHz band with 250 kbps data rate. 
With an integrated onboard omnidirecitonal antenna, the BAT 
mote sensor has a maximum of 50m (indoor) or 125m (outdoor) 
transmission range. 
The beacon node used for RSSI gathering and analysis is 
also attached with a Maxim AP-12 panel antenna, which is 
rotated by an Fastech Ezi-Servo 28L step motor, as shown in 
Fig. 7(a). The beacon node used in localization is attached with 
two AP-12 panel antennas with perpendicular antennas, as 
shown in Fig. 7(b). Its horizontal and vertical beamwidth are 
65 and 28 degrees, respectively.

VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose ALRD to estimate AoA by 
comparing the RSSI values of beacon signals received from 
two perpendicular-orientationed directional antennas installed 
at the same place. We have implemented and installed ALRD 
in a 10m by 10m indoor environment. Our experiment results 
show that a sensor node can estimate its location within 0.1s 
with an average localization error of 124cm. Furthermore, we 
propose two methods, namely maximum-point-minimum-
diameter (MPMD) and maximum-point-minimum-rectangle 
(MPMR), to reduce ALRD localization errors by gathering 
more beacon signals within 1s for finding the set of estimated 
locations of maximum density. The experiment results 
demonstrate that MPMD and MPMR can reduce the 
localization error by a factor about 29% to 89 centimeters. 
ALRD is thus suitable for mobile sensing and actuating 
applications since it allows a sensor node to fast localize itself 
with small errors. 
ALRD is currently implemented, installed and examined in 
a small indoor area with two beacon nodes. It is believed that 
by installing more beacon nodes, ALRD can still help sensor 
nodes in a large indoor area to estimate their locations quickly 
and accurately. We may need to equip four directional 
antennas, with orientations being east, north, west and south, 
in a beacon node and well plan the installation locations and 
beacon signal emissions of all beacon nodes. A sensor node 
can choose the two beacon nodes with the strongest signals 
from two perpendicular-orientationed directional antennas to 
perform ALRD localization procedure to locate itself 
accurately. We will focus on applying ALRD to realize a 
large-area localization system in the future. Moreover, we will 
also try to apply different types of directional antennas and 
their combinations to ALRD for the possibility to further 
reduce localization errors.
