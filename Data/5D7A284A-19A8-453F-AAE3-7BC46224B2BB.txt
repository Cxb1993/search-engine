gradually increase during the creep process of the 
model honeycomb with a steady-state rate of a . 
Equilibrium requires that the bending moment M  
at any cross-section of the cell edges be related to the 
normal stress within them. It is assumed that the 
creep strain rate of solid cell edges sε  under the 
induced normal stress sσ  can be described by the 
power law creep: ( )0 0/ sns sε ε σ σ=  . By assuming 
that plane cross-sections of the cell edges remain 
plane, the induced creep strain rate is related to the 
change rate of their curvature. The governing 
equation for the creep-buckling of honeycombs with 
plateau borders can be obtained by equating the 
work-rate due to the compressive load P  to the 
change rate of strain energy in the three cell edges 
AB, BC and BE. The governing equation for the 
creep-buckling of honeycombs with plateau borders 
expressed in terms of the elastic buckling strength of 
hexagonal honeycombs *elσ  is obtained:

Effects of the solid distribution in cell edges on the 
failure time, cbt , for the onset of creep-buckling of 
regular hexagonal honeycombs subjected to a 
normalized compressive stress * */cb elσ σ  when 
* / sρ ρ =0.02 is shown in Fig. 2.  From Fig. 2, it is 
seen that the failure time cbt  for the onset of creep 
buckling of regular hexagonal honeycombs increases 
as 2Φ  is increased when they are subjected to the 
same normalized compressive stress * */cb elσ σ . 
 
In addition, failure due to a substantial creep strain 
caused by cell-edge creep-bending should be taken 
into account in determining the service life of 
hexagonal honeycombs. In order to determine 
whether creep-buckling or creep-bending dominates 
the failure mechanism of hexagonal honeycombs 
with plateau borders, a substantial creep strain of 0.2 
is allowed before the failure time for the onset of 
creep-buckling. The failure times for both 
creep-bending (dashed lines) and creep-buckling 
(solid lines) of regular hexagonal honeycombs with 
2Φ =0.6 are shown in Figure 3 when 
* / sρ ρ = 0.02.  
From Fig. 3, it is found that the strain by 
creep-bending becomes large before creep-buckling 
occurs when the applied compressive stress *2σ  is
