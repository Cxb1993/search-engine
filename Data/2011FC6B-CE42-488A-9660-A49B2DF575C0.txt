典型污染河川之現地生物整治工程評估研究 
計畫主持人：陳博彥 
摘要 
本計劃將過去研究成果予以延伸，原提出典型污染河川現地生物整治評估，
但在西半部幾條污染較嚴重之河川(如：淡水河、基隆河、大仁溪)均未能篩選出
具優異脫色能力之菌株，反而意外的在台灣淨土─宜蘭水源地及河川中篩得。由
於在無污染條件仍能篩得具偶氮染料脫色能力之菌株(A.hydrophila)，這代表該菌
株之脫色能力是演化過程中即存源於基因上並長久存在。再者，其脫色能力可能
與相關致病性具相互關聯性存在。並以固定染料(反應紅 141 號)條件下，篩選具
優異染料脫色能力之菌株，並與過去研究中之西台灣染整活性污泥篩選出之染料
脫色菌(Pseudomonas luteola)作比較分析並排序比較。後以篩選出之優異菌株進
行不同染料之懸浮式批式培養，並將其生長動態響應曲線及生物脫色分別進行反
應動力學模擬評估，並以評估之結果作為現地生物整治工程之後續評估依據，以
及反應機構上之討論。  
關鍵字：本土性微生物、染料脫色、生物刺激、Aeromonas hydrophila。 
 
1.前言 
就台灣地理環境，中央山脈以地理屏障分隔成東、西台灣兩大部分，長期
以來亦由於地緣上先天之存在及台西為政治核心等因素使東、西台灣之工商分布
發展呈現不對等之成長情況，卻也因此使東台灣未經工業污染仍保有台灣最完整
的本土多樣生態，不因台灣快速之工商發展而消逝。尤其是位於東北台灣之蘭陽
平原，長久以來憑藉著雪山山脈之天然屏障保護下，雖緊鄰繁華北北基，卻因獨
特之地理屏障及縣治地方政府之阻隔污染工業政策，因此始能形成並保有獨特多
樣之本土生態系統，再者，宜蘭長久以來工作人口外流現象嚴重，至今仍未受到
工業帶來之環境破壞及污染。更重要的是宜蘭因地形導致高降雨氣候及在三面環
山之地形下具有豐沛雨量，因此對環境更有沖刷洗淨之作用，也因此低污染條件

而 Chen et al.[4]也在台灣苗栗之染整污泥中篩選出優勢脫色菌發現 A. 
hydrophila，並以各種不同類型之染料試驗 A. hydrophila 之脫色效果，發現 A. 
hydrophila 可脫除多種類型之染料，與先前脫色菌(如 P. luteola)[12][13]較不相同，
A. hydrophila 除可脫除偶氮(Azo)染料外，如蒽醌(Anthraquinone)、靛(Indigoid)
種類之非偶氮染料亦具有脫色能力，其中比較於不同生長條件(好氧/厭氧/缺氧)
下 A. hydrophila 是否仍能維持良好之脫色能力，並且研究在不同之 pH 值(4.5~11)
下其生長或脫色效果是否受限，以及在含有不同濃度(0~10 g L-1)之葡萄糖
(glucose)環境下其脫色差異是否受葡萄糖之刺激而增加。其中之亦發現 A. 
hydrophila 在 200 rpm 搖瓶培養下仍具脫色能力，但效果較靜置脫色差，此點與
本研究中所發現之現象相吻合，總體而言亦是於缺氧或靜置條件下之總脫色速率
較快，於先搖瓶後靜置之條件下，可培養出較高菌體濃度亦可大大縮短脫色所需
時間，此點與過去研究相吻合[14]。A. hydrophila 最適生長環境之 pH 值約在 6~9
之間，過酸或過鹼之環境容易抑制菌體生長導致脫色效果不佳，而添加葡萄糖並
不利於菌體生長及脫色，因葡萄糖被 A. hydrophila 分解後產生有機酸[10]，導致
pH 值降低，不利於菌體生長脫色。 
總結上述文獻可知，A. hydrophila 具破壞偶氮鍵結之能力，且可脫除非偶氮
之染料，於缺氧之環境下亦可緩慢生長且有助於脫色，但若以先好氧後厭氧方式
培養可使菌體濃度增加而有助於脫色，並適於弱酸或弱鹼環境下生長及脫色。因
此本研究將採先搖瓶後靜置之培養方式進行之，並與文獻[4]中使用相同之各種染
料進行實驗，比較於不同染料下之生長及脫色效果。 
 
2.材料與方法 
2.1 研究方法 
2.1.1 篩菌前處理： 
(a)(水樣)：以真空抽氣過濾(#5A or 1 濾紙, ADVANIEC)100 ml 水樣置於事先高溫
滅菌過之錐形瓶中初步篩除顆粒細沙部份，為有效篩除黴菌而加入 89.83 
mg(8200 U/L)紐黴素。 
(b)(土樣)：取 20 克土樣置於裝有高溫滅菌過之 100 ml 生理食鹽水(10 g L-1)之錐
形瓶中，加入 89.83 mg(8200 U/L)紐黴素以篩除黴菌，進行搖瓶(125 rpm)30 分鐘
以使孔隙內微生物均勻擴散相溶入水相中。而後真空抽氣過濾(#5A or 1 濾紙, 
ADVANIEC)去除顆粒細沙後置於另一事先高溫滅菌過之錐形瓶內。 
由各錐形瓶內取 0.05 ml 樣本(1%v/v)分別加入裝有 5 ml 1/5XLB((單位 g L-1); 
casein peptone 2.0, yeast extract 1.0, sodium chloride 10.0)培養液的試管中，進行 12
小時前培養，後各取 1 ml 菌液分別加入含有滅菌過之 9 ml 滅菌生理食鹽水(10g 
L-1) 進行 6 次連續十倍稀釋，分別平板塗抹於洋菜瓊脂上，置於 30℃之恆溫箱
培養 12 小時，再分別勾取單一菌落進行三次連續分離純化，並觀察單一菌落大
小尺寸及顏色外觀以初步判斷相同之可能。待菌株純化後勾取單一菌落分別加入
裝有 5 ml 1/5LB 培養液之試管內，進行 12 小時搖瓶前培養，再從各試管中取出
 - 6 - 
TEMED 2 µl )先將齒模放置旁邊預備，將下層膠迅速定點鑄進玻璃內至滿溢出
來，左手迅速將齒模放入玻璃之間約等 20 至 30 分鐘，確定膠已經凝固後，把
齒模抽掉，即可預備來跑電泳。 
 
2.1.2.5 Sample buffer 製備 
將 sample：水：sample buffer ( 2X ) 以 1：1：1 比例數加入微離心管中，以
沸水浴加熱五分鐘，即可預備跑電泳。 
 
2.1.2.6 電泳 
將所有設備擺好，將 Running buffer 稀釋成 1 倍 300 ml 後倒入電泳槽，將
配置好的 sample，load 進 well 中注意 sample 不可溢出 well，否則會影響實驗結
果。依其正負極，蓋上蓋子，起始先將伏特數調至 50 V，等約過 10 分鐘後，將
伏特數調至 100 V 跑到底即可 (此時約需 2 hr )。 
 
2.1.2.7 染褪色 
電泳跑完後將膠體拿出放在保鮮盒中，加入 CBR 染料 ( CBR 0.25 g, 甲醇 45 
ml, 水 45 ml, 乙酸 10 ml, 用過濾紙過濾，使用前須先搖晃使其均勻 )，染色約
15 至 20 分鐘，將 CBR 染料回收，加入脫色液 ( 70 ml 甲醇, 70 ml 醋酸加去離子
水至 1 L ) 脫色 15 分鐘，倒掉脫色液再加入新的脫色液脫色 15 分鐘，倒掉脫色
液再加入新的脫色液脫色 overnight (不可超過 12 小時，避免脫色過度)，取出膠
體進行照相。 
 
2.1.3 染料： 
本研究所使用之染料分別為反應紅 141 號 (RR141)、反應黑 5 號 (RB5)、反
應藍 171 號(RB171)、反應黃 84 號(RY84)、直接黃 86 號(DY86)、反應紅 198 號 
(RR198)、反應綠 19 號(RG19)，分別由台灣永光化學公司及明太企業所購買提
供。濃度測量則以分光度計(HITACHI spectropho- tometer, UV-2001) 波長分別於
544，600，609，411，393，522，631nm 之最大吸收下來進行。再者，由於染料
之化學結構可能會於高溫溼熱滅菌過程中因不穩定而分解，因此皆以滅菌過之微
過濾濾頭(Millipore Millex-GS 0.22 µm)除菌後，再行使用。 
 
2.1.4 相同染料之懸浮式批次實驗 
 分別於 LB 瓊脂平板中勾取 A. hydrophila NIU01~13 之單一菌落於 50ml LB
培養液((單位：g L-1 ); casein peptone 10.0, yeast extract 5.0, sodium chloride 10.0)
中培養， 以 30℃, 125 rpm 前培養 12 hr。培養後殖種 1 %(v/v)菌液分別加入含有
先行過濾除菌之 300 mg L-1 染料之 LB 培養液中，並以 30℃, 125 rpm 搖瓶方式進
行培養(此時 t=-6 h)，並同步監測菌體及染料濃度，於 t=0 時開始靜置脫色，亦
持續紀錄菌體及染料濃度之時間變化。

圖 3.1.1 礁溪水源地所篩選出 NIU 菌株 1~7 號生長及生物脫色特性曲線圖。 
針對礁溪水源地篩選結果來看，由圖 3.1.1 及圖 3.1.2 可得知脫色速率最佳
者為 NIU 01，其 SDR 約 64.5 mg L-1 h-1 ODU-1，而 SDR 速率依次分別為 NIU 
01(64.5)＞NIU 03(63.5)＞NIU 04(63.1)＞NIU 13(60.3)＞NIU 06(55)＞NIU 12(54.1)
＞NIU 02(53.5)＞NIU 08(53.7)＞NIU 09(51.7)＞NIU 05(51.1) ＞NIU 07(50.7)＞
NIU 10(47.7)＞NIU 11(46.8)。圖 3.1.3 至 3.1.4 並可明確看出此 13 株菌株之生物
脫色活性確實為非生長相關，與先前研究之 P. luteola 於 RR141 號染料 300mg L-1
下之最大比脫色速率(SDR)為 4.0 mg L-1h-1ODU-1[14]，相較之下本研究所篩選出之
菌株有更佳之脫色能力，其最大 SDR(64.5>4)可達 P. luteola 之 17 倍，由此點可
知本菌株於實際運用上能較其他同樣具有脫色能力之菌株可能有較佳之廢水處
理效果。 
再者，由冬山河口利澤簡橋附近水樣篩得菌株來看，由圖 3.1.5 之冬山河混
合菌株之脫色速率，相較於圖 3.1.1~2 之礁溪水源地之菌株之脫色效果，儘管兩
者經鑑定為同一 A. hydrophila，但是可知礁溪水源地之菌株相對具有良好之脫色
活性，其於相同染料濃度下之比脫色速率約為 1.8 倍(64.5 > 36.0 mg L-1 h-1 
ODU-1)，表示即使是同種菌株由於在不同地區篩選，仍有所差異(例如：黑人、
白人生理特性差異)，因此後續研究均取定脫色速率最佳之 NIU01 為標準菌株來
作評估。

3.2 不同染料之懸浮式批式培養 
由於 A. hydrophila 因具破壞偶氮鍵鍵結之能力而脫色[3][4]，而染料所有之化
學結構直接影響偶氮斷鍵難易程度[16]，比對各染料之相對化學結構[17]，以瞭解
菌株於斷鍵時，受官能基(團)之影響。 
這 7 種偶氮染料依結構大致可區分為兩大類：一為萘酚類(如 RR198、RB5、
RR141、RB171 及 RG19；圖 3.2.1) 和非萘酚類(如 RY84 及 DY86；圖 3.2.2)。大
致上萘酚類除了 RG19 以外，均較非萘酚類較易脫色。而這些萘酚類偶氮染料之
羥基(─OH; hydroxyl group)與偶氮鍵呈鄰位，這現象與文獻[18]之情形類似。文獻
[19]
 亦指出染料分子之位置及性質會影響偶氮羥基化合物之互變異構
(azo-hydrazone)，至於萘酚類偶氮染料之羥基與偶氮鍵呈對位或間位，是否有利
於本菌體之生物脫色，仍須繼續研究探討。 
另外，在萘酚之結構上均有亞硫酸鈉基(-SO3Na)與偶氮鍵呈鄰位，雖會造成
立體阻礙效應，但因亞硫酸鈉基為拉電子基，其憑藉著共振效應仍可對偶氮鍵具
有拉電子效應，而降低偶氮鍵之電子密度，有利於偶氮染料之生物還原降解 
(reductive biodegradation) [15]，而非萘酚類之亞硫酸鈉基與偶氮鍵呈間位，其共振
效應對偶氮鍵之拉電子效應較弱。 
在萘酚類中 RR198 為最易脫色，因其苯環上具有與偶氮鍵呈對位之拉電子
基(-SO2(CH2)2SO3Na)，這有利於偶氮染料之還原脫色，根據文獻[19]指出苯環上
之拉電子取代基與偶氮鍵若互為對位則會增加還原作用，且其又是單偶氮染料因
此較雙偶氮染料易脫色，因此在萘酚類中 RR198 為最易脫色者。其次則為 RB5，
RB5 之結構為以 H 酸呈對稱之雙偶氮染料，二個苯環上有拉電子基

圖 3.2.4 各染料持續搖動(好氧)之生長脫色曲線 
於各染料脫色比較中發現唯有 RB5 於好氧生長仍時具脫色能力，因此以好
氧生長實驗其他染料是否亦會於生長時脫色，由圖 3.2.4 可知 RB5 能於好氧生長
條件下脫色，因此如圖 3.2.5 將 RB5 於不同時間靜置，以推論其脫色效果差異。 
圖 3.2.5 反應黑(RB5)於不同時間靜置之生長脫色曲線圖。將菌體分別於時間為-3，-2，-1，0，1，
2 時靜置，起始染料濃度約為 300 mg L-1。 
由圖 3.2.5 可知菌體之靜置時間越早越有利於脫色，是因靜置時菌體處於
厭氧條件下，因此刺激脫色速率增加，但於 t=-1(搖動 5 小時)之後靜置之脫色速
率並無太大差異，通常較高之菌體濃度可得較快之脫色速度，但由此可知當菌體

附件一  赴國外出差或研習心得報告 
第六屆「含氯及生物難分解化合物復育國際研討會」 
陳博彥 
國立宜蘭大學化工與材料工程系 
參加會議經過 
 此次第六屆「含氯及生物難分解化合物復育國際研討會」於二○○八年五月
十九日至二十二日假臨北加州十七哩半島海岸邊之蒙特瑞爾 (Monterey, 
California USA)會議中心舉行。此次會議依往年慣例仍由享譽國際之 Battelle 研
究中心負責籌辦，大會分別於十八日下午四時起及次日上午八時三十分起受理與
會者之註冊報到。此次會議主要著重於具新穎性技術應用開發為主題：例如於不
同環境介質下特殊含氯化合物及生物難分解污染物污染場址之特性分析、處理及
監測；實驗室、模擬實場、污染現地應用則著重於新穎性之復育應用技術開發以
及可完成關閉場址清除之方法等。 
 筆者於十五日午夜搭乘華航班機於當日下午八時左右抵達美國洛杉磯國際
機場(LAX)，次三日即依事前約定自費前往拜訪鄰近學術(例如 UCI, UCSD, 
 - 20 - 
水層之處理及傳輸現象。而內容更包括可滲透性之阻擋技術 (Barrier 
Technologies)，化學性氧化處理，生物技術，以及聯合復育處理技術與加強式自
然降減等。而 panel discussion 中更提及風險性評估及污染場址管理等綠色議題更
著重於政府及工業專家來討論其他相關重要之環境議題。筆者發現美國環保署對
本土性生態之維繫及保持一如往昔十分關切及嚴謹，是以對「生物刺激」
(biostimulation)及「生物補強」(bioaugmentation)之做法極為關切及小心，像是夏
威夷 TCE 污染含水層之問題則堅持以現地本土篩選之菌株進行復育處理完全禁
止美國本土 Dhc 菌株進行處理。尤其是「生物補強」原則上以現存生物相之規
模放大為主，若慮及外加生物則必須經過環保署之嚴格把關核可，筆者更發現為
維護生態更不惜血本以數公噸工業級之發酵系統來大量生產現地處理微生物
(Dhc)來回注處理，真是難能可貴。再依聽講過程中統計，此次會議多為先進工
業國家之研究人員參加，此亦是因為此國際會議論文需經 peer-review 之「品管」
有關，共有 850 篇口頭或海報論文與會發表。我國與會者可能因國外出差經費不
足之緣故 除筆者外並無其他學校、生技中心或是工研院等單位參加並做論文報
告。此次會議八百餘篇的論文與會，唯會期安排僅有四天似感緊湊，其中有頗多
具經驗分享或學術價值之論文僅能以海報發表稍嫌可惜，應可延長時間以利實質
之學研交流，筆者位求補足研究新知能量之不足，筆者更在每日會後於旅館中重
新整理補充筆記，並歸納出可能應用於研究之新穎方向，以利於返國後之研究應

ness to live in hormony with their highly populated environment
to save “Formosa” for sustainable development. In particular, biore-
mediation of contaminated environments in Taiwan is considered
as apriority “green technology”, as contaminants canbe completely
destructed at a lower cost and faster rate with no lingering liability.
According to Taiwan EPA’s drafted guidelines for incorporating bio-
diversity conservation, indigenous rather than foreign microbiota
should be ﬁrst considered for bioremediation. Incidentally, to res-
cue this possibly last “Shangri-La” in Taiwan, an effective strategy
to protect vanishing the biodiversity in northeast Taiwan would be
inevitably required.
With the deliberate exclusion of polluted industries to be set-
tled in I-Lan County and the geological separation of Lanyang Plain
from Central Mountain Range, the abundant microbiota in such
a geologically speciﬁc and ecologically diverse environment were
saved to be explored in Taiwan. This ﬁrst-attempt feasibility study
tended to isolate the strains with the biodecolorization capabil-
ity of a model diazo dye reactive red 141 (RR141) from indigenous
microorganisms in the Lanyang Plain. This study indicated that
after serial acclimation to achieve stable color removal activities the
color removal efﬁciency of isolated strainswas approximately 4–5-
foldbetter than that ofPseudomonas luteola [19–21]. In addition, the
color removal efﬁciency of the mixed culture was nearly 10-fold to
that of P. luteola at ca. 600mgL−1 RR141, indicating a promising fea-
sibility of isolated cultures to be applicable for practical treatments
[22].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Screening protocol for decolorizers
To probe the presence of high-performance bacterial decoloriz-
ers, diazo reactive red 141 (RR141; chemical structure refer to Fig.
2 in Chen [22]) was used for comparative selection upon feasi-
ble dye-degrading isolates. In addition, to exclude fungi during
screening 0.1 g L−1 (ca. 8200units L−1) fungicide nystatin (powder-
ized from effervescent vaginal tablets— MycostatinTM; [23]) was
added via sterilization through 0.2m membrane ﬁlter. River and
mud samples were obtained from various sources (e.g., Lanyang
Hsi and Dongshan River in Lanyang River Basin (site to obtain iso-
lates herein), hot and cold springs and fountain springs sources
near the Central Mountain range such as Chiao-Hsi, Su-Ao) in the
Lanyang Plain. With a selection pressure of nystatin and RR141, the
bacterial strainswith color removal capabilitywere predominantly
separated from themicrobial communities in samples. Serial streak
selections (at least 3 cycles) were then applied to guarantee the
purityof individual isolated strains. At least 10bacterial strainswith
the excellent capability of azo dye decolorization were predomi-
nantly isolated from river water andmud samples of Lanyang River
Basin, hot and cold springs and fountain springs water sources on
the Lanyang Plain in the northeast Taiwan. The bacteria-isolating
procedures were conducted in a screening medium 1/5XLB (in
g L−1: casein peptone 2.0, yeast extract 1.0, sodium chloride 10.0)
and RR141 0.2 g L−1. To reveal the presence or absence of bacte-
rial decolorizers, all of the samples inoculated with isolates were
cultured in5.0mLRR141-containing1/5XLBmediumusingawater-
bath incubator (SHINKWANG, SKW-12) at 30 ◦C for 18–20h. Note
that to prevent any unintentional exclusion of possible decolorizers
in samples, only fresh samples (<4h storage in 4 ◦C after sampling)
were taken for a representative screening among viable popula-
tions on site. A loopful of seed from sampled vials in the presence
of nystatinwas then taken to streak onto a LB-streak agar plate (per

Samples were diluted to an optical density of less than

for convergence, numerical differentiations were compared
with differentiations by reducing step size as t/2 (i.e.,

deﬁned as calculated tolerance to achieve convergent criteria. Oth-

2.4. Morphological and biochemical test
Morphological examination was observed by a light micro-
scope (Zeiss Axioskop). Gram Stain Set S (BD, USA) and the Ryu
non-staining KOH method [24] were used to ascertain the Gram
reaction. Biochemical identiﬁcation presented in the Microgen
ID microtests was determined by Microgen ID software Version
1.1.16.19 according to the recommendation of the manufacturer
(Microgen Bioproducts, UK).
2.5. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Ampliﬁcation and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was
performed as described previously [25]. The sequence was com-
pared with others available in GenBank. The multiple-sequence
alignment including six hydrogen-producing strains and their clos-
est relatives were performed using the BioEdit program [26]. The
phylogenetic reconstruction was inferred by using the neighbor-
joining method in the BioEdit software. A bootstrap analysis
(conﬁdence values estimated from 1000 replications of each
sequence) was performed for the neighbor-joining analysis using
the CLUSTAL w1.7 program [27]. A phylogenetic tree was drawn
using the TREEVIEW program [28]. Sequence identities were cal-
culated using the BioEdit program.

mixed culture also slightly delayed the biodecolorization capabil-
ity to be expressed (i.e., early incubation at t=0–6h). As indicated
in Fig. 1(a), dye decolorization reached a maximal value when
cell growth had nearly stopped at the stationary phase (ca. 1–2h
delay after static incubation). Such a non-growth-associated phe-
nomenon suggested that anaerobic decolorizersweredominated in
the mixed culture. That is, SGR progressively decreased to approx-
imately zero and SDR gradually increased (Fig. 1(b)). However,
SDR reached a maximum value at nearly 3–5h after static incuba-
tion and then gradually decreased. This decrease in decolorization
might be due to a signiﬁcant accumulation of toxic intermediates
(i.e., aromatic amines), which were formed by a cleavage of azo-
bonds. In addition, the exhaustion of essential nutrients (e.g., basic
growth factors and energy sources) and formations of inhibitory
products limited cells to regenerate NADH, which is a required
electron donor for bacterial decolorization. In addition, as the ini-
tial RR141 concentration increased, the maximal SDR was also
increased in parallel. This point might suggest that RR141 and its
related intermediates were not so toxic to this mixed culture com-
pared to P. luteola [22]. This might explain why the maximal SDR
(ca. 60mgL−1 h−1 ODU−1) at 600mgL−1 RR141 was nearly 10-fold
to maximal SDR of P. luteola [21,22], showing a more promising
color removal capability taking place in the mixed culture.
Plane-curve proﬁles of SDR versus SGR at various time (Fig. 1(b))
also showed the trajectories of decolorization at various initial
RR141 concentrations. By increasing values of time, the orientation
of all proﬁles started at certain points (e.g., 0.24h−1 for 800mgL−1)
in +x-axis (i.e., +SGR-axis) and headed to negative x-direction to
the points (e.g., 0.01–0.02h−1) near the origin, and then turned
along +y-axis (i.e., +SDR-axis). Once the trajectories reached amax-
imal value of ca. 70mgL−1 h−1 ODU−1, they asymptotically decayed
back to the origin along negative y-direction. The resulting trajecto-
ries along x and y-axes clearly illustrated the growth-independent
characteristics of bacterial decolorization.
3.2. Unacclimated cultures
To reveal the existence of possible predominant “hero”
decolorizers in the mixed cultures, decolorization experiments
at 200mgL−1 using 55 SCs as seed cultures were carried
out (e.g., only rank top 10 in maximal SDR were plotted in
Figs. 2 and 3). As shown in Figs. 2(a) and 3(a), apparently none
of any maximal SDR (the best for KC13 at 8.6mgL−1 ODU−1 h−1;
Fig. 2(a)) in unacclimated seed cultures could achieve the
maximal SDR in the mixed culture (36.5mgL−1 ODU−1 h−1;
Fig. 1(a)). According to the maximal SDR (unit in
mgL−1 ODU−1 h−1), the top 10 rankings in a decreasing order are
KC13(8.6) >KB24(8.51) >KB15(7.6) >KB19(7.23) >KB4(7.2) >Ra2
(7.1) >KB17(7.0) >KB22(6.7) >KC3(5.6). Comparison upon Figs. 1–3
simply suggested that symbiotic and cooperative interactions
(e.g., the aluruistic behavior of some strain released extracellular
metabolites as “stimulators” for an enhancement in decoloriza-
tion; [29]) among species in mixed cultures for decolorization
might be still signiﬁcant to provide higher efﬁciency in color
removal compared to unacclimated single strains. It might suggest
that decolorization performance could be signiﬁcantly increased
after serial acclimation. With serial adaptations in dye-laden
environments, bacterial cells should provide a more efﬁcient
machinery for color removal in order to achieve maximal and
stable decolorization capability. As indicated in Figs. 2(b) and
3(b), dye decolorization performance of the top 10 strains was
conﬁrmed to be non-growth associated. Although RR141 is a diazo
dye, the biphasic phenomena of decolorization for diazo reactive
black B taking place in P. luteola [21] were not observed in these
isolated strains (Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)). This explained why all the
trajectories in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b) were almost not located within
the ﬁrst quadrant, but located in +SDR and +SGR axes. This might
indirectly suggest that RR141 was not toxic to our isolated strains
compared to P. luteola.
3.3. Acclimated cultures
As the unacclimated pure cultures could not perform efﬁcient
color removal efﬁciencies, serial acclimation upon these unaccli-
mated cultures was conducted in order to obtain metabolically
stable cultureswithmaximal decolorization capabilities. For exam-
ple, for the culture KB15, the initial SDR (in mgL−1 h−1 ODU−1) in
the serial acclimation gradually increased (i.e., 3.62 (ﬁrst) < 11.43
(second) <13.96 (third) <17.65 (fourth)). After the fourth cycle in
acclimation, the most metabolically stable dye decolorization was
achieved as SDR was nearly invariant (<∼5–10% variation). The
monotonic increases in initial SDR simply revealed a promising fea-
sibility of this acclimation protocol to attainmaximal color removal
performance. After this serial acclimation to obtain metabolically
stable decolorizers, the top 10 rankings of maximal SDR (in
mgL−1 h−1 ODU−1) among isolated strains in a decreasing order are
KB15(30.9) >KC22(29.0) >KC10(28.0) >KC20(26.9) >KB11(25.8) >
KA1(24.5) >KC7(24.0) >KB14(23.0) >Ra1(22.6) >KB3(21.7) (Figs.
5(a) and 6(a)). However, the maximal SDR for the best decol-
orizer KB15 was still ca. 20% less than the maximal SDR in mixed
culture (36.5mgL−1 h−1 ODU−1) at initial RR141 concentration
200mgL−1. This might point out combined cooperative interac-
tions among decolorizers played a crucial role for optimal color
removal. Since almost all of unacclimated cultures could tolerate
in the presence of RR141 for decolorization (Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)),
evidently fully acclimated cultures could perform much better
decolorization performance without any toxic stress (Figs. 5(a)
and 6(a)). This also conﬁrmed that the trajectories in phase-plane
plots in Figs. 5(b) and 6(b) were located in +SDR and +SGR axes for
non-growth-association of color removal.
3.4. Microbiological identiﬁcation
After screening upon the isolates via SDS-PAGE (sodium
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; data not
shown), all protein spectra (i.e., translation proﬁles) were simi-
lar and thus all isolates identiﬁed to be phenotypically related
(also genetically related if they are prokaryotic). In addition,
microscopic examination showed that six strains (27@M11K5,
133@D9E9, 157@G3.5H11, KB23, KB24, 52@D9E15) were in rod
shape (1.0–2.5m×0.5–0.8m) with the Gram negative reaction.
Note that strains 27@M11K5, 133@D9E9, 157@G3.5H11, 52@D9E15
were some indigenous strains also isolated from I-Lan as con-
trols. Biochemical identiﬁcation by Microgen ID microtest system
indicates that the six strains were similar to each other and all
belong to genus Aeromonas. Two strains (KB23 and 133@D9E9)
were randomly selected to determine their sequences of 16S rRNA
gene. Further inspections upon gene diversity [30] in samples
taken from the Lanyang Plain will be conducted for conclusive
remarks. Based on the sequence identity of 16S rRNA gene, KB23
and 133@D9E9 resemble to each other with a 99.9% identity. The
highest similarity values of two strains were obtained towards
type strains of Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966T (98.1% identity)
and Aeromonas media ATCC 33907T (97.8% identity). The simi-
larity levels towards other Aeromonas species were below 97.5%.
The 16S rRNA gene phylogenic tree was constructed for the two
strains and those of the described Aeromonas species were shown
in Fig. 7. According to the results of physiological and16S rRNAgene
sequence examinations, the strains should belong to Aeromonas
species.

Generally, due to Darwin’s ‘‘survival to the fittest’’ for
natural selection the appropriate site to isolate bacterials
strains with a capability for the biodegradation of a specific
contaminant is believed to be the site polluted with such a
contaminant. However, we tended to postulate a different
concept to test whether to seek for microbiota with such a
biodegrading power in a unpolluted environment is truly not
feasible. Due to a long-term geological isolation and
significant rainfalls to washout naturally polluted factors in
Northeast Taiwan, the microbiota present in Northeast Taiwan
had already become divided into somewhat different breeds
with specific biological functions from those in Western
Taiwan. In particular, regarding the site to obtain our isolated
strains (i.e., a site of fountain spring reservoir near Chiao-
Hsi), any human settlements around the water body and banks
of fountain spring had been banned in order to keep this spring
reservoir free of pollution as a drinking water supply to the
entire city of I-Lan ever since. Moreover, with the deliberate
exclusion of polluted industries from I-Lan County and the
geological isolation of Lanyang Plain from western Taiwan by
the Central Mountain Range, the plentiful bioresources from
such a geologically specific and ecologically diverse
ecosystem were still remained to be explored. This first-
attempt feasibility study selected azo decolorization cap-
ability of a model diazo-dye C.I. reactive red 141 (RR141) as
a selection pressure for the isolation of indigenous micro-
organisms from the Lanyang Plain. The suspected isolates
with dye decolorization capability would be predominantly
selected from the microbial communities in samples. To
clearly reveal species differences among isolated strains, the
protein gel-electropherosis based on expression profiles of
translated proteins was also carried out. The suspected
different strains were then identified via PCR-augmented 16S
rRNA gene analyses. Compared to gene sequences available
in the NCBI BLAST gene bank, >98% of gene sequences in
isolated strains NIU01 and NIU12 were identical to
Aeromonas hydrophila. In addition, the decolorization
performances of our isolated A. hydrophila NIU strains were
approximately 16-fold better than that of Pseudomonas
luteola (Chen, 2002; Hu, 1994, 1998), suggesting a promising
potential to be used for dye-laden wastewater treatment. It
might suggest that the bacteria with the most efficient color
removal capability were not necessary to be found only from
contaminated or polluted environments.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Screening protocol for decolorizers
River and mud samples were obtained from myriad of
sources (e.g., Lanyang Hsi and Dongshan River in Lanyang
River Basin, hot and cold springs and fountain springs near the
Central Mountain range such as Chiao-Hsi, Su-Ao) in the
Lanyang Plain. Note that the water body and banks of a
fountain spring near Chiao-Hsi were the location of isolated
strains. The screening principles were straightforward:
dispersing of the sample, distributing an aliquot to an
appropriate medium, incubating under suitable selection
conditions, and, finally, isolating the developed colonies.
The pretreatment of fresh samples taken from sites of isolation
was carried out in two ways: (1) water samples (ca. 100 mL)
were filtered via sterile #5A (90 mm, Quantitative ashless) or
#1 (90 mm, Qualitative) filter paper (ADVANTEC) to remove
particles. (2) Soil or mud samples (ca. 20 g) were mixed with
the fungicide nystatin in 100-mL sterilized saline solution
(NaCl(aq) 10 g/L). To exclude fungi during screening, 0.1 g/L
(ca. 8200 units/L) fungicide nystatin (powderized from
effervescent vaginal tablets—MycostatinTM) was added via
a filtration sterilization through 0.2 mm membrane filter. Note
that nystatin (a polyene antibiotic) can bind to sterol
components (mainly in ergosterol) on cell membrane of fungi
to alter cellular permeability to ultimate cell death due to this
augmentated toxic effects of nystatin to cells (Kinsky, 1967).
Then, samples were well agitated in a water-bath shaker
(SHINKWANG, SKW-12) at 125 rpm for 30 min to enhance
the diffusion of the microbiota within the porous particles into
the bulk aqueous phase. Moreover, to completely remove
residual particles in samples the vacuum filtration through #5A
or #1 filter papers was applied afterwards. Then, 50-mL seed
sample was cultivated in 5-mL 1/5XLB (in (g/L): casein
peptone 2.0, yeast extract 1.0, sodium chloride 10.0) for 12 h at
30 8C, 125 rpm. To reduce the numbers of bacterial cells down
to measurable levels for isolation of single cells, 10-fold serial
dilution was conducted via sterile test tubes (i.e., 1 mL sample
diluted with 9 mL sterile saline diluents); and then mixed
solutions taken from the test tubes were spread onto the
sterilized solidified agar medium for isolation. The strain
isolation through these serial plate-count diluents was carried
out at least three times to ensure the purity of isolates. Once
single colonies were obtained, a loopful of isolated seed taken
from a single colony on the agar-plate was cultured in 5-mL
1/5XLB broth for 12 h at 30 8C, 125 rpm. The 50-mL (1%, v/v)
culture broth was added to sterile test tubes containing 5-mL
1/5XLB for 6 h culture. Then, diazo RR141 (ca. 300 mg/L)
was added to cultures to proceed static incubation for
decolorization (ca. 48 h). The 13 well-performed decolorizers
were chosen afterwards for comparative analysis of color
removal in batch cultures.

where the derivatives dX/dt and d[Dye]/dt are both zero (i.e., lag
phases in growth and phenol degradation curves should be
excluded). Thus, it is feasible to apply this phase-plane analysis
to reveal growth-dependent phenomena of fermentation in this
study.
2.5. Morphological and biochemical test
Morphological examination was observed by a light
microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). Gram Stain Set S (BD, USA)
and the Ryu non-staining KOH method (Powers, 1995) were
used to ascertain the Gram reaction. Biochemical identification
presented in the Microgen ID microtests was determined by
Microgen ID software Version 1.1.16.19 according to the
recommendation of the manufacturer (Microgen Bioproducts,
UK).
2.6. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Amplification and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
was performed as described previously (Chen et al., 2001). The
sequence was compared with others available in GenBank. The
multiple-sequence alignment including six hydrogen-producing
strains and their closest relatives were performed using the
BioEdit program (Hall, 1999). The phylogenetic reconstruction
was inferred by using the neighbor-joiningmethod in theBioEdit
software.Abootstrap analysis (confidencevalues estimated from
1000 replications of each sequence) was performed for the
neighbor-joining analysis using the CLUSTAL w 1.7 program
(Thompson et al., 1997). A phylogenetic tree was drawn using
theTREEVIEWprogram (Page, 1996). Sequence identitieswere
calculated using the BioEdit program.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Color removal performance
After screening upon river and mud samples from various
sources, only soil and water sample obtained from a fountain
spring near Chiao-Hsi was found to reveal color removal
capability of diazo-dye RR141. As indicated in Figs. 1 and 2,
color removal was temporarily paused in flask cultures
(125 rpm). Decolorization of RR141 took place with static
incubation (i.e., anaerobic condition; t > 0+) and was repressed
in aerobic cultures during aerobic growth (t < 0). As literature
indicated (Palleria and Chambers, 1997; Yang and Yu, 1996;
Zhang et al., 1999), only fungal culture was feasible to develop
aerobic mineralization of azo-dyes. Thus, this finding simply
revealed that our isolates conducted decolorization at anaerobic
conditions due to our successful exclusion of fungi by use of
nystatin during strain isolation. As indicated in Figs. 1 and 2,
dye decolorization reached a maximal value when cell growth

16S rRNA gene. Based on the sequence identity of 16S rRNA
gene, NIU01, NIU12, KB23 and 133@D9E9 resemble to each
other with a 100–99.9% identity. Note that strains KB23, KB24
and 133@D9E9 were some indigenous strains also isolated
from I-Lan as controls. The highest similarity values of three
strains were obtained towards type strains of A. hydrophila
ATCC 7966T (98.1% identity) and Aeromonas media ATCC
33907T (97.8% identity). The similarity levels towards other
Aeromonas species were below 97.5%. The 16S rRNA gene
phylogenic tree was constructed for the two strains and those of
the described Aeromonas species were shown in Fig. 5.
According to the results of physiological and 16S rRNA gene
sequence examinations, the strains should belong to Aeromonas
species (more likely A. hydrophila).
4. Conclusion
Our isolated strains with color removal performances were
approximately 16-fold better than P. luteola (Chen, 2002,
2006a; Hu, 1994, 1998) (which was predominantly isolated
from activated sludge of a dye-containing wastewater treatment
plant). It suggested a promising potential to be applicable for
dye-laden wastewater treatment. Follow-up study will inspect
comparison of color removal using diverse dyes (e.g.,
triphenylmethane dyes) for conclusive remarks. This might
suggest that the bacteria with the most efficient color removal
are not absolutely necessary to be found only from
contaminated or polluted environments. According to the
results of physiological and 16S rRNA gene sequence
examinations, the strains should belong to Aeromonas species
(very likely A. hydrophila). However, most strains of A.
hydrophila are potential pathogen to fish, Aeromonas species is
probably more appropriate to be cultivated in closed-vessel
bioreactor systems preventing to spread out to the environment.

心舉行。此次會議依往年慣例仍由享譽國際之 Battelle 研究中心負責籌辦，大會分別於
十八日下午四時起及次日上午八時三十分起受理與會者之註冊報到。此次會議主要著
重於具新穎性技術應用開發為主題：例如於不同環境介質下特殊含氯化合物及生物難
分解污染物污染場址之特性分析、處理及監測；實驗室、模擬實場、污染現地應用則
著重於新穎性之復育應用技術開發以及可完成關閉場址清除之方法等。
筆者於十五日午夜搭乘華航班機於當日下午八時左右抵達美國洛杉磯國際機場
(LAX)，次三日即依事前約定自費前往拜訪鄰近學術(例如 UCI, UCSD, UCLA)及生物技
術工業界(CANJI,AMGEN)進行訪問，以取得新近美國生物技術研發方向資訊。於十八
日下午搭乘聯合航空由洛杉磯飛北加州蒙特瑞爾半島機場，並於當日午後完成報到手
續後，領取相關資料，迄行前往下榻之旅館，研讀所發之資料，以利次日起之會議議
程參加之學術研發交流。
與會心得
大會於十九日上午九時正舉行開幕儀式，由 Battelle主辦人 Dr. Bruce M. Sass主持，此
會議自 1998 年啟辦，迄今已十載，而此次共計大會超過 850 篇論文發表，與會者美加
地區佔 82%，世界其他地區則有 13%，依介紹此次大會之特色除依過去之慣例議程
外，更加入兩大主題進行 panel discussions，討論面對世界氣候變遷及水文變化時如何
規劃及管理復育工作之進行以及目前全球場址整治之熱門綠色議題「Sustainable
Remediation- Issues and Opportunities」。緊接著安排的是大會邀請的專題演說。由 Ohio
State University Paolo Gabrielli教授發表其多年來於世界各地調查冰河或凍原中針對冰
層(ice core)之CO2及溫度變化來作深入淺出之介紹，依目前近三百年來支冰層數據紀錄
顯示2005年是歷史上之最高溫年，而2006/2007則是歷史上之最暖冬季，全球暖化主要
歸因於溫室氣體之排放，空氣懸浮微粒之變化，地球本身反射力之變遷等因素所造
3程序作深入討論。D Session 則是分享現地化學氧化之改良技術部份(例如以雙氧水或
是觸媒添加方式進行) 。F Session 則以討論具高經濟可行性之處理方式之技術研發，
例如NASA於甘迺迪太空中心發射台附近之地下水污染; 再者像存在於高危害性廢棄物
污染場址如何進行地下水及土壤污染處理，再者是引入生命週期之概念來對現地處理
成效做整體性評估。G Session 則是針對自然降減效果之確認工作，則表示針對處理場
址之範圍，殘留量(像是 RDX及 TNT)及管理經營之工作部分作深入探討分享。
考察參觀活動
至於依事前約定自費前往拜訪鄰近學術(例如 UCI, UCR)及生物技術工業界(CANJI,
AMGEN)進行訪問部分，筆者發現生物技術之發展以擴展至各角落，不論醫藥、食品
及環境均需以DNA及RNA技術來偵測，以取得分子生物上之證據資訊。此點是值得觀
察之部分。「二十一世紀是生物之世紀」確實不假。生物產氫、本土性菌種開發及相關
生物支援之永續開發等部分均為未來研發極重要之主題。
建議
會議期間大會為除了在二十一日下午開放讓所有與會者及其家屬能安排一自由活
動之旅以欣賞此罕見之陸海空三景並列之半島風光「十七哩海灣線」之外，於美麗海岸
餐廳進食欣賞海獅共在生態美景，倒令人有置身桃源飽學研發成果之感。可謂使與會
者有賓至如歸之感。另會議期間之籌辦經驗，倒可提供國內各單位舉行國際會議時之
參考。下一屆之會議將於 2010 年在同地點舉行，屆時也期盼國外世界及之專家更可共
同結論出更具前瞻性之做法為美麗新世界提出更有效之做法。
