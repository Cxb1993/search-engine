High-Level Synthesis of Switched-Capacitor  
ΣΔ-Modulators Using Model-Based Designs 
 
 
Abstract — The conventional high-level SDM synthesis is mainly 
based on behavior simulation which is very time-consuming. This 
paper is the first in the literature to propose model-based SDM 
synthesis. Model-based approach can be at the order of 104 times 
faster than simulation-based approach, but it is never realized 
before due to the incompleteness of non-ideality models. The 
recent establishment of settling noise model and OTA distortion 
model facilitates model-based SDM designs. Nonetheless, new 
problems associated with model-based approaches arise, notably 
correlation between noises and overload on quantizers. In this 
paper, noise correlation models are derived, and a SDM input 
estimator is proposed to avoid quantizer overload. Quantitative 
comparisons between model-based and simulation-based 
approach are made. It is demonstrated that, in addition to much 
faster speed, the model-based approach can greatly enhance 
SDM design processes by explicitly compute all noise powers and 
distortion powers. Furthermore, a SDM design optimization 
scheme is proposed, which incorporates a DAC distortion model 
and a comprehensive power consumption model. This model-
based optimization is tested against two published SDM designs, 
achieving results with higher SNDR and lower power in a much 
shorter design time. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
igma-Delta modulator (SDM) A/D converter is the most 
popular topology for high resolution applications because 
the SDM is implemented by feeding back quantization signal 
which reduces the quantization noise power [1]. Besides, the 
SDM is essential for system-on-chip (SoC) designs, due to 
smaller area and lower power consumption [2]. The SDM can 
be implemented by continuous-time (CT) or discrete-time 
(DT). DT SDM with switched-capacitor (SC) implementation 
is much more popular than CT SDM because CT SDM suffers 
from problems such as sensitivity of clock jitter and excess 
loop delay [3]. We will focus on the design of SC SDM in this 
paper. 
In SDM designs, the designer needs to adjust design 
parameters so that high SNR or SNDR [4] can be achieved. 
The design parameters include oversampling ratio (OSR), 
sampling capacitance, op-amp gain bandwidth, op-amp slew-
rate, op-amp DC-gain, quantizer bit number, etc. The variation 
of any single design parameter can potentially affect several 
noises and distortions in different ways, and may change 
system power consumption. For example, increasing OSR can 
reduce quantization noise, but increases settling noise and 
power consumption. It is typically a complex task to adjust all 
design parameters to come up with a good design. Currently, 
the design tasks rely heavily on simulation tools. Conventional 
circuit simulator (SPICE) provides high accuracy, but it takes . 
too long a simulation time. In order to overcome this problem, 
various SDM simulators have been developed, such as circuit-
based macro models [5], time-domain macro models [6], finite 
difference equation [7], table-lookup models [8] and behavior 
simulation technique [9] [10]. The circuit-based macro models 
are equivalent circuits made from components available in the 
circuit simulator. It increases the speed over circuit simulator 
but still needs too much time for simulation. The time-domain 
macro models are based on the time-domain equations used to 
describe the circuit transient behavior. Although it produces 
quick simulation and can model dynamic error, this approach 
is not flexible. The finite difference equations model is based 
on the z-transfer function of SDM. It produces the quickest 
simulation time. However, the capability for modeling non-
idealities is poor. The table-lookup model is quick, but not 
flexible [11], [12]. Recently, behavior simulation technique 
provides good accuracy, high speed and more flexibility [2], 
[11]. In the early period, the behavior simulator used event-
driven behavior simulation techniques [13]-[15]. In these 
techniques, the behavior simulators are implemented in C-
language. Therefore, the block models can’t be easily 
modified [2]. Recently, in order to overcome this problem, the 
most popular approach is to implements the behavior 
simulation in MATLAB Simulink environment [2], [3], [16] - 
[18]. On the other hand, there exist behavior simulations by 
using VHDL-AMS and Verilog-A [19]-[23]. The VHDL-
AMS behavior simulation provides faster simulation time than 
MATLAB Simulink [23] and the Verilog-A behavior 
simulation can provide many choices between accuracy and 
efficiency [22]; however, to date, both simulations are not 
popular enough for SDM designs. Since behavior simulation is 
very time consuming, in order to search for adequate design 
parameter combinations at much lesser cost, recently 
techniques related to simulated annealing [2] and generic 
algorithm [14], [24] have been employed. However, the 
designs obtained in such cases are suboptimal. 
This paper is the first one in the literature to propose model-
based SDM design method. In contrast to simulation-based 
designs reviewed above, model-based designs can potentially 
be at the order of 10
4
 times faster. Model-based designs can 
also explicitly compute each noise power and distortion power, 
greatly enhancing design process, while simulation-based 
designs only generates sum of noise and distortion powers. 
However, model-based designs require that all relevant noise 
models and distortion models be available. During the past 
two decades, most non-ideality models have been developed 
[4, 13, 27, 28, 29], except that models for op-amp nonlinear 
DC-gain distortion and settling noise were critically lacking. 
This is the reason model-based SDM design has never 
materialized. Recently, however, both the nonlinear DC-gain 
distortion power model and the settling noise power model 
have been proposed in [25] and [26] respectively. Thus model-
based design becomes possible. Nonetheless, new problems 
S

 Capacitor nonlinearity distortion power model  
(PCap_distortion). The capacitor CS introduces harmonic 
distortion because its capacitance depends on the input 
signal. The related SDM output distortion power 
PCap_distortion is derived in [13] under the assumption that 
the gain of the second stage equals to 1. 
3) Finite and Nonlinear DC-gain 
 Finite DC-gain noise power model (PFinite_DC-gain). A0 
affects the noise transfer function, resulting in SDM 
output noise power PFinite_DC-gain [13]. 
 Nonlinear op-amp DC-gain distortion power model 
(PDC-gain_distortion). DC-gain is nonlinear because it varies 
with integrator output voltage. The related SDM output 
distortion power PDC-gain_distortion can be obtained from 
[25] which is a function of A0 and VOS.  
4) Bandwidth and Slew-Rate 
 Settling noise power model (PSettl ing_noise). The  
limited integrator GBW and SR make the voltage charge 
and discharge incomplete at integrator output, which 
causes SDM output noise power PSettling_noise [26]. 
 Slew-rate distortion power model (PSettling_distortion). If 
input signal of integrator is so large that it exceeds the 
integrator SR limitation, a dependency of the settling 
error on its input is created, which results slew-rate 
distortion. The related SDM output distortion power 
PSettling_Distortion can be obtained from [13]. 
5) OTA Noises 
 OTA thermal noise power model (POTA_thermal). The OTA 
thermal noise originates from the MOSFET non-
idealities of OTA. Form the input-referred noise PSD 
2
nOTAV  [4], [42]. the in-band OTA thermal noise power at 
SDM output can be derived as

where a1 is equal to CS1/Ci1, and Hsamp(f) and Hint(f)  are 
the transfer functions from noise source to integrator 
output in sampling phase and integration phase 
respectively.  
 
 Flicker (1/f) noise power model (POTA_flicker). The flicker 
noise also originates from the MOSFET non-idealities of 
OTA. The related SDM output noise power POTA_flicker 
can be obtained from [28] related to fcr.  
 Reference circuit noise power model (PRef_noise).  
Reference circuit noise usually contains OTA thermal 
noise and flicker noise, appearing at reference voltage of 
DAC circuit in figure 1. The related SDM output noise 
power can be obtained from [28], [4]. 
6) Clock Jitter Effect (PJitter_noise). 
The clock jitter noise originates from the σj in sampling 
phase, resulting in non-uniform sampling of converter 
input signal. The related noise power PJitter_Noise can be 
obtained from [29]. 
 
7) Comparator Hysteresis(PHysteresis) 
The h is defined as the minimum overdrive to change 
the comparator’s output, which leads to a loss of 
performance of SDM. The related SDM output noise 
power PHysteresis can be obtained from [29]. 
 
8) Multi-bit DAC Non-idealities   
 DAC noise power model (PDAC_noise). The DAC noise 
originates from the σdac (CU). The related SDM output 
noise power PDAC_noise can be obtained from [4]. 
 DAC distortion power model (PDAC_distortion). The DAC is 
nonlinear because the transfer function of DAC depends 
on the capacitance of CU. No DAC distortion model 
exists before. A PDAC_distortion is provided in Appendix A 
for DAC up to 3 bits. For DAC with more than 3 bits, 
DWA is usually activated.     
B. Non-ideality models for MASH 
 
Fig. 2: Block diagram of the 2-1 Mash SDM 
MASH architecture shown in Fig. 2 cascades low order 
single loops modulators in order to get higher order noise 
shaping effect. The output can be derived as follow:

1 1 2( ) ( ) ( ) (1 ) ( )Y z z X z z N z z z N z
        (3) 
where N1(z) and N2(z) are the noises and equivalent distortions 
generated by first and second stage single loop SDM 
respectively. According to (3), the noises and equivalent 
distortions generated by second stage single loop SDM are 
subjected to noise shaping effect. Furthermore, the 
quantization noise of first stage single loop SDM is the input 
of second stage single loop SDM; hence SDM input signal 
will not affects the integrators of second stage single loop 
SDM. The harmonic distortion due to non-idealities in second 
stage single loop SDM can be significantly reduced [44]. For 
these reasons, the MASH output noise powers and nonlinear 
distortion powers are dominated by those of the first stage 
single loop modulator. Therefore, most MASH output non-
ideality power models are the same as those discussed in 
Section II-A, except finite DC-gain noise and capacitor 
mismatch noise. Models of finite DC-gain noise and capacitor 
mismatch noise need to be re-derived and they can be obtained 
from [28].  
C. Non-idealities for other architectures 
The Single-loop and MASH SDM discussed above are by 
far the most popular architectures. Non-ideality models for

Fig. 4: The block diagram of single-loop 2nd-order SDM
 
Consider the five independent noises. The modified 
quantization noise (6) is expressed in Fig. 4 as EQ applied at 
nodes 3 and the factor μ at feedback loop of first integrator. 
The remaining four noises are applied at node 1 of Fig. 4, the 
sum of which is donated as E. These five noises are treated as 
independent because EQ and the four noises in E are all 
assumed to be Gaussian and white. Next, to explain why these 
five noises are correlated to settling noise, recall that settling 
error ε is approximated in [26] as

It is clear from (9) and (10) that settling error ε is correlated to 
E, EQ, and μ.

directly affects Y1 swing. Second part is white noise E(z) 
followed by unity gain transfer function. This part can be 
neglected because the magnitude of E is typically very small 
for median to high resolution SDM. For example, a 15 
effective number of bit design results in white noise smaller 
than -80dB which equals to the variance of E; hence the 
standard deviation of E is  
8 4( ) 10 10E         (30) 
Since E is typically of Gaussian distribution, the three sigma 
magnitude contains 99.73% of random number. The 
magnitude of E can be set as 
83 ( ) 3 10 0.0003E       (31) 
which is very small compared with X. Third part of (29) is the 
sum of two independent time sequences eq(n-2) and 2eq(n-1), 
denoted by q1(n) and q2(n). The probability density functions 
(pdf) of q1 and q2, i.e. fq1(x) and fq2(x), are shown in Fig. 9. 
Suppose q(n)=q1(n)+q2(n). The pdf of q(n) can be  obtained 
from convolution of fq1(x) and fq2(x)  [32], and is shown in Fig. 
10 (a). According to Fig. 10 (a), the swing of node Y1 due to 
quantization noise can be characterized as 3VLSB/2, where VLSB 
is defined after (6). This result has been verified by behavior 
simulation. For Vref=1 and B=2, the corresponding simulation 
result is shown in Fig. 10 (b).

The case for B=1 needs special attention, since quantizer 
overloads for all Ain except Ain=0. But it is indicated in [12] 
that the excess noise due to overloading the quantizer 
increases quite slowly; hence there is a margin linearly related 
to Vref for one bit quantizer. We evaluated this margin to be 
0.36 Vref by behavior simulation. Therefore, for one bit case,

IV. ADVANTAGES OF MODEL-BASED SDM DESIGN 
The first advantage of model-based design over simulation-
based design is obviously its speed; the former can be at the 
order 10
4
 times faster. The second advantage is that the model-
based approach provides more insights to guide the design, 
since this design method explicitly computes all noise powers 
and distortion powers. These issues are quantitatively 
analyzed in this section. 
A. SNDR Speed Comparison  
For model-based SDM design, the SNDR is computed by 
(5).  
In simulation-based SDM design (in MATLAB Simulink 
environment), generating SNDR is a more complex process. 
First, behavior simulation is conducted and output data points 
11 
 
which is a simplified OTA power model involves few 
design parameters. Although it is generally known that OTA 
consumes much power in SDM, [43] indicates that other 
parts of SDM may also consume significant amount of 
power. Hence, our model in Appendix B takes into account 
the power dissipation of every part of a SDM. Even data 
weighted averaging (DWA) power is included when DWA 
is activated. 
3) Cost Function Generation 
After the SNDR and POWER are computed in Fig. 12, 
they are used to generate 
 10log( )

     (37) 
which is a modified figure of merit (FOM) [1]. The factor K 
serves as a relative weighting. If high resolution design is 
required, the value of K can be set bigger, so that increasing 
SNDR would play a more important role than reducing 
POWER. In contrast, if low power design is emphasized, the 
value of K can be set smaller. 
 
   At the end of the optimization process, the design parameter 
set corresponding to the minimum cost function value is 
treated as the design achieved.

PDAC_distortion -77.05 - dB 
 
The design published in [33] and that achieved from our 
methodology are listed in Table IV. The noise powers and 
distortion powers for both designs are listed in Table V. 
 
Discussion 1: The design from model-based optimization is 
better than that of [33], achieving 89.91dB SNDR at 13.22mW 
compared with 75.51dB SNDR at 34.19mW in [33]. 
Discussion 2: Ref. [33] chose to use a 3-bit DAC without 
DWA, resulting in a dominating PDAC_distortion at -77.05dB and 
a large PDAC_noise at -85.68dB which brought down SNDR. In 
contrast, our method by nature tries to evenly distribute noise 
power and distortion power among all noise and distortion 
categories, while minimizing POWER at the same time. This 
is the main reason our design can achieve a higher SNDR with 
lower POWER. Our algorithm selected a 2-bit DAC with 
DWA, eliminating PDAC_distortion  and lowering PDAC_noise to  
-123.17dB.  
Discussion 3: The measured SNDR reported in [33] was 
78dB, but the computed SNDR by our models based on the 
design parameters reported in [33] is 75.5 dB. Since DAC 
distortion power is the dominating non-ideality, it is the sole 
factor which affects the SNDR values. DAC distortion power 
is a random variable; hence the PDAC_distortion computed by our 
model in Appendix A is an expected value. The DAC 
distortion power of the chip of [33] is specific only to that chip. 
This may explain the difference in measured and computed 
SNDR. 
Discussion 4: The power consumption by SDM of [33] is 
more than two times that of our SDM. This large power 
consumption is due to high values of GBW and SR used. 
Although large GBW and SR values indeed reduce PSettling_noise 
to -216dB in [33], this offered no help to boost SNDR. 
Discussion 5: The SNDR computed by our model are 
verified by Simulink.  
Discussion 6: Table VI shows model-based optimization 
design results for different K values. It can be observed form 
Table VI that when K increases, more emphasis is on rising 
SNDR; when K decreases, more emphasis is on reducing 
POWER.

The characteristic of nonlinear DAC I/O transfer curve 
depends on two factors. The first is the DAC output error 
variance (41), as is demonstrated by Fig. 14 that larger output 
errors would result in an I/O curve which is more nonlinear. 
The second factor is the number of DAC output levels. Fig. 15 
shows two I/O curves with the same output error variance, but 
Fig. 15 (b) is more nonlinear than Fig. 15 (a) because more 
levels in Fig. 15 (b) result in more variation. Accordingly, we 
propose to model DAC I/O relationship as

where Δcap is related to variation magnitude demonstrated by

uniformly distributed random variable in [0,2π] representing 
possible horizontal shift. Then, utilizing Taylor’s series, RHS

SW2 turn on. The capacitor C discharges to ground through a 
resister R2. Because of the motion of the switches turning on 
and off repeatedly, a signal of charging and discharging is 
produced.

B. Simulation of Numerical Analysis  
The circuit parameters are listed in Table I. Based on the 
iterating map from (9), we can generate the bifurcation 
diagram handily and fast. By controlling the sV  as the 
bifurcation parameter, we periodically collect the discrete-time 
values of cv  with the initial transient discarded. Thus, we 
have one set of data for each value of sV . A bifurcation 
diagram can then be constructed after a sufficient number of 
data sets are obtained as is shown in Fig.3. Fig.3 presents the 
results of the way from period-1 to chaos. The relationship of 
system states and controlling parameter sV  is shown in Table 
II. It is worth noting from Table II that the circuit generates 
chaotic signal when 
s
V  is less than 11.7V.

Table II  Relationship of system states and controlling parameter sV  
2) The average output voltage is not affected: 
In steady observation, the stability of a converter is 
decided by duty ratio. From the analysis of quasi-period, we 
know the average output voltage is the same in despite of 
period-1, period-2, period-4 or chaos states. In transient 
observation, because the frequency of clock signal under 
chaos state is broadband and well mixed, therefore 
duration of clock impulse is longer or shorter at different 
time and it affects the duration of charge or discharge of 
an inductor. In chaos analysis of the above, although the 
clock frequency is varying, the average output voltage is 
still in reference voltage level in close loop. Therefore, 
the voltage ripple oscillates in the reference voltage. So 
the average output voltage is not affected. 
 
IV. SIMULATION RESULT AND ANALYSIS 
A. Simulation of Stability 
When the input voltage of chaos generator, 
sV , is adjusted 
to be quasi-period state, the simulations are presented in

B. Response to Varying Loading Current 
We add a loading current 20% of original loading 
current and pump it from the converter. The simulation result 
is shown in Fig.11. We can observe that the output voltage 
still retain to be 40V in the steady state even through loading 
is varying.

C. Simulation of PSD 
We get data of simulation in PSIM and calculate PSD by 
Matlab tool. The following are the simulation diagrams of 
PSD in quasi-period. 
 
operating states, every power is still the same. Compare the 
period-1 state with different operating state form Fig.12 to 
Fig.14, the results present the degree of reduction and are 
shown in Tables III, IV and V. In Fig.12 and Fig.13, we can 
observe that there is obviously discrete spectrum in period-1 
state. Fig.12 presents clearly that the peak values in harmonics 
have reduced in period-2 state. Fig.13 shows the spectrum in 
period-4 state. There is the continue spectrum under chaos in 
Fig.14. Fig.15 shows the obvious difference with period-1 and 
chaos state. Because power is constant and chaos is broadband, 
the peak values in original harmonics are reduced. Therefore, 
the chaos can improve the question of EMI. 
Fig.16 presents the reduction percent for Period-2, 
Period-4 and chaos. In period doubling state, the peak values 
of operating and harmonics frequencies in the spectrum can be 
reduced. It must be noted that the operating frequency is 
reduced to 43% under chaos state and other harmonics are 
reduced to 35% at least. Therefore, chaos generator has well 
effects for suppressing EMI of harmonics.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we mainly employ a new chaos generator to 
suppress EMI of DC-DC converters. Unlike other chaos 
technique, our scheme can maintain the performance of 
DC-DC converters while significantly reduce their EMI. 
Moreover, the chaos-modulated clock by the new chaos 
generator can be realized by a simple analog circuit without 
any inductor. Therefore, it is possible to have inexpensive 
implementation in CMOS. 
This study have given a comparative investigation into the 
effects of the randomness level on the PSD of a chaos 
modulation scheme that are applied to classical DC-DC 
converters operating in CCM. The result has been 
demonstrated that controlling the degree of chaos can gradually 
spread the discrete frequency over the frequency spectrum, and 
harmonic power can be reduced up to 35%. Moreover, 
according to our theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, 
the average output voltage is not affected in the chaos state. In 
conclusion, a DC-DC converter operating in chaos state can 
effectively suppresses peak values of EMI in a converter, and 
can conform to several EMI norms.
