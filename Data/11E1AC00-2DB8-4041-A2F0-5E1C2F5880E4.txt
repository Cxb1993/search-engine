including blue, green and white light. Gaussian curve fitting of the PL spectra revealed that 
the competition between the blue, blue-green, green and yellow band emissions and their 
relative emission intensities were strongly associated with various defects. Blue emission was 
attributed to large numbers of oxygen defects in alumina, while green and yellow emissions 
were related to oxygen and zinc defects in ZnO, respectively. Under specific conditions, 
white light, consisting of blue, blue-green, green and yellow band emissions, was obtained. 
Further TEM analysis indicated that the defect structure of ANZTs could be manipulated by 
the interface interaction between alumina and the ZnO nanotubes.

I. Introduction 
Zinc oxides (ZnO) have attracted extensive attention for nanoscale electronic and 
optoelectronic device applications because of their wide band gap and large excitation 
binding energy (60 meV).[1] Numerous ZnO nanostructures have been demonstrated, 
including nanowires, nanotubes, amd nanobelts. [2-4] It is believed that tubular structures 
exhibit higher porosity and larger surface area than bulk materials, creating enhanced 
performance and activity.[5] Recently, ZnO nanotubes have been fabricated by many 
methods, such as a hydrothermal process, a template-assisted method and a thermal oxidation 
process.[6-8] Almost all reports of ZnO nanotubes focus on morphologies, synthetic methods, 
and growth mechanisms. As mentioned above, however, the increased surface area is a key 
feature of tubular ZnO. Inevitably, high surface areas will significantly modify the chemical 
and physical properties of materials, which can be reflected in photoluminescence (PL) 
spectra.  
Liu et al. studied the optical properties of faceted hexagonal ZnO nanotubes (ZTs) and 
reported that a strong yellow emission was detected after annealing at 400oC in ambient 
oxygen.[9] In contrast, Sun et al. reported that after annealing at 400 °C for 2h under vacuum, 
the PL spectrum of ZTs showed an increase in UV emission intensity and a concomitant 
decrease in green–yellow emission.[10] Zhang et al. recently mentioned that a strong green 
emission was obtained from ZnO nanotubes annealed in H2.[11] Considering the large 
surface area-to-volume ratio in nanostructures, large numbers of defects and impurities at the 
surface of ZnO nanotubes can produce new states that act as visible luminescence centers and 
broaden the visible emission band. This suggests that the ZnO nanostructure could, after 
low-temperature growth and high-temperature annealing treatments, be developed for 
application in photoluminescent devices. In our previous study, we found that an alumina 
film deposited on ZnO nanorods grown by a wet chemical process led to ultra-strong blue

3. Results and Discussion 
 
Figure 1 shows an SEM image of as-grown ZnO nanotubes synthesized in solution at 95oC 
for 24 h. A low-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1(a) reveals that the nanotubes are several 
(2~5 µm) micrometers in length. The corresponding high-magnification SEM image in Fig. 
1(b) shows that each nanotube has a uniform width over its entire length. The typical 
diameter is in the range of 20-30 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 
1(c)) shows that the ZTs are open-headed tubular structures with wall thicknesses of about 
5~7 nm and inner diameters of about 15~20 nm. Fig. 1(d), an enlargement of the marked area 
in Fig. 1(c), shows the highly preferential growth of ZnO nanotubes along the c-axis 
orientation (0002) with a lattice constant of ~ 0.52 nm. Compared to ZnO nanowires, the 
c-axis of ZTs is more dissolved.  In addition, rough inner surfaces were observed. Sun and 
co-workers reported that, during the formation of ZnO nanotubes in the solution, the 
concentration of all zinc-containing species falls and the concentration of OH- increases with 
increasing t, leading to a progressive reduction in the overall Zinc/OH- ratio.[14] At first, the 
solution supersaturation falls below that required for growth. It may even fall to the point of 
triggering dissolution, as suggested by the appearance of volcano-like surface structures that 
serve as templates for the emerging NTs. With increasing time, the c-axis plane dissolves into 
Zn(OH)2, forming the nanotube structure. Here, a rough inner surface was developed during 
the dissolution of the c-axis plane. 
The ZTs were annealed in O2 from 200oC to 600oC. At 200oC, no obvious changes were 
observed in the SEM and TEM images. Fig. 2(a) shows that ZTs annealed at 400oC in 
ambient oxygen had a diameter of 30 nm. After annealing at 400oC in oxygen ambient, 
surface roughness increased on the outside surface, probably due to the thermal etching seen 
in the TEM images in Fig. 2(a). Therefore, under these conditions, the diameter and wall 
thickness of the ZTs were possibly altered, and many surface defects were produced on the 
outside surface. The disappearance of the c-axis plane led to the formation of the nanotube 
structure, creating a rough inner wall at the initial stages. However, the inner surface 
morphology became flattened, as shown in Figure 2(b). When the ZTs were thermally 
annealed, the atoms may possibly have obtained enough energy to rearrange into their native 
morphology. To reduce the surface energy, the side plane wanted to flatten, but it was heavily 
thermally etched. It is believed that this is why the diameter of the ZTs decreased with 
increasing annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature increased to 600oC, 
low-magnification TEM of the ZTs indicated that the inner wall became very rough (Fig. 
2(c)). Further investigation by high-resolution TEM analysis (Fig. 2(d)) demonstrated that the 
inner wall became wave-like in shape. The lattice fringe of the ZT was different (marked 
with two arrows), indicating that the wave shape was probably related to structure relaxation 
during the high temperature treatment.

the following equations.[19] 
          
Al2O3             2 AlZn + 3 OO + VZn + 2 h 
         
2 ZnO              2 ZnAl + 2 OO + VO + 2 e  
 
The corresponding diffraction pattern clearly revealed that the ANZT structure consisted 
of ZnO nanotubes grown with (002) planes and poly-crystalline γ-phase alumina. Fig. 6(a) 
also shows lattice distortion and a local interaction at the ZnO/Al2O3 interface because of 
nanoscale effects. The lattice fringe changed from 5.2Å inside the ZnO (002) to about 4.6 Å 
at the interface of ZnO/Al2O3. This may be related to the formation of a spinel structure 
reported in the literature. [20]  
To observe emission at 600-700 nm, a 400 nm optical pass was used, resulting in the 
appearance of 410 nm emission. Fig. 7 shows the PL spectra of the ANZTs under different 
annealing conditions. As annealed in oxygen ambient, it was found that the PL spectra of the 
ANZTs exhibit a very broad peak from 425 nm to 750 nm as shown in Fig. 7(a). Furthermore, 
it was also observed that the PL spectra are also changed with annealing atmosphere. As seen 
in Fig. 7(b), ANZTs annealed in nitrogen at different temperatures displayed one strong blue 
and one weak green-yellow peak. The broad green-yellow peak dominated at low annealing 
temperatures (below 600°C), and a strong blue emission peak at ~450 nm occurred at 600oC. 
The blue emission was primarily due to singly ionized oxygen vacancies in alumina.[21] 
Large numbers of oxygen vacancies in the ANZT alumina nanoparticle shell were produced 
by annealing in nitrogen at high temperature. The above-mentioned results indicated that the 
PL spectra of the alumina-coated ZnO nanotubes (ANZTs) could emit different colors by 
varying the annealing conditions. Fig. 7(c) illustrates this with blue, green and white 
emissions. 
The PL spectra of the ANZTs annealed in oxygen at different temperatures were further 
analyzed by Gaussian curve fitting as shown in Fig. 8. The fit revealed four emissions located 
in blue, blue-green, green and yellow regions. When the samples were annealed at 200oC in 
oxygen, the yellow emission dominated due to OH bond absorption on the surface of ANZTs. 
Increasing the annealing temperature to 400oC increased the blue emission and decreased the 
yellow emission. The blue emission was probably related to phase transformation from the 
boehmite phase (octahedrally coordinated) to the γ-phase (tetrahedrallly coordinated), which 
starts to appear at this temperature. During phase transform, pentahedrally coordinated 
aluminum was produced, and singly ionized oxygen vacancies at the F+ centers were 
responsible for the blue emission. For a detailed discussion, refer to our previous study.[12] 
In general, the oxygen affinity in alumina is stronger than that in ZnO. Hence, the oxygen 
interstitials in the ZnO core diffused into the alumina shell, reducing the number of oxygen
