考(transmitted reference;TR)的方法[20,21]，可以解決上述的一些問題。在這種TR的架構上，發送
端會傳送成對的訊號(pulse pair)，第一個訊號稱為參考訊號(reference pulse)，第二個訊號稱為資
料訊號(data pulse)。在接生端會使用一個或多個的差分關連器(differential correlator)，其接收端的
架構如圖一所示。使用TR的優點除了可以完全接收多路徑的訊號及不需要事先估測通道的資訊
之外，也不需要在接收端產生一個樣本訊號(template signal)，因此架構上十分精簡。 
然而，TR存在兩個主要的缺點。其一是需要花費額外的頻寬和能量傳送參考訊號，另一個
缺點則是可能因為參考訊號和資料訊號之間的時間間隔不夠長，而造成多餘的幅間干擾
(inter-frame interference)。當資料速率越高時，IFI的影響會越嚴重。使用一種稱為幅差分(frame 
differential) [22-24]的方式可以避免這些缺點。幅差分的觀念是利用已知前後兩個幅內的訊號之間
的傳送時間間距(Di)，並將接收到的信號延遲Di的時間，再與下一個接收到的信號執行correlate
的運算，如圖二所示。使用幅差分方式不僅可以避免TR的缺點，還可以保留TR的優點。然而圖
二中所示的幅差分方法，不只硬體架構複雜(需要Nf -1個積分器)，也需要複雜的同步控制。 
如圖三，我們所提出的幅差分接收架構稱為「延遲線合併訊號接收器」(delay line combination 
receiver; DLC receiver)，其中的同步方法已經發表在 IEEE Communications Letters [25]。此方法不
只是硬體架構簡單，而且可以更簡單快速的達到時間同步。此接收器共包含三大部分，分別是前
端的幅差分延遲線(frame-differential delay line; FDL)，同步與估測裝置，及解調變裝置。 
FDL 的設計是此系統的一項簡單有效的創新，在理論上可以解決接收端因為跳時所衍生出
來的時序控制問題。其作用之一是把接收到的一個週期，例如符號週期，內的訊號集合到同一時
間點輸出。另一個作用是得到任意前後兩個幅之間的訊號乘積，其效果就如同發送參考(TR)接受
器的前端。在同步與估測裝置中，利用上述 FDL 的輸出訊號，經過積分器後，將會在每一個週
期開始的時間點產生一個驟然上升或下降的輸出。利用偵測此一訊號驟升或驟降的時間點，就可
以得到預定的週期開始時間，例如預定為某一段跳時碼的開始時間或是符號時間。

Abstract— We proposed a timing synchronization algorithm
designed as ”Timing with Delay Line Combination” (TDLC)
for impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) systems. In that
article, a delay line combination (DLC) receiver is introduced
to combine all correlation operations of received signals and
their delay versions in a previous frame. By taking advantage
of the DLC receiver, the synchronization scheme can achieve
symbol timing synchronization within a single symbol duration.
In this paper, the performance of the IR-UWB systems with DLC
receiver, including probability of detection (PD), mean square
error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER), is investigated.
Index Terms— Synchronization, modulation, delay line combi-
nation (DLC), impulse radio (IR), ultra-wideband (UWB).
I. INTRODUCTION
A time-hopping impulse radio (TH-IR) UWB system wasintroduced by Scholtz in 1993 [1]. The TH-IR UWB
system does not utilize a sinusoidal carrier to raise the signal
to a frequency band in which signals propagate well, but rather
communicates with trains of time-hopping baseband pulses
on the order of sub-nanoseconds. Since pulse durations are
very short, multipaths are resolvable down to path differential
delays on the order of ≤1 nanosecond (ns). The high time
resolution significantly reduces fading effects even in indoor
environments [2]-[4], and makes TH-IR UWB systems viable
candidates for short-range or indoor wireless communications.
However, ultra-fine time resolution also increased the design
challenges in timing synchronization and signal energy collec-
tion. Many studies have attempted to resolve synchronization
issues in TH-IR UWB systems [5]-[10]. Yang and Giannakis
[5] presented a symbol differential synchronization scheme
named timing with dirty templates (TDT). The synchronization
criterion of TDT exploits the fact that the cross-correlation
of these ”dirty templates” exhibits a unique maximum at the
correct symbol time. Although TDT algorithms are effective,
they are inoperable in multi-user environments without as-
signing a specific training pattern for each user. In [6], the
author of this dissertation presented a parallel search syn-
chronization scheme (PS-SLD) for frame-differential IR-UWB
receivers. The parallel search mechanism reduces the search
region of symbol boundaries to only a single frame duration.
Moreover, only one delay element is needed in each branch
as a shared looped delay-line (SLD) is utilized to reduce the
implementation complexity of the parallel search mechanism.
Furthermore, the author of this dissertation presented a more

effective synchronization scheme called ”timing with delay-
line combination (TDLC)” algorithm [7]. In that paper a novel
receiver front-end, called a frame differential delay-line (FDL)
was proposed. The FDL resembles a series of transmitted-
reference (TR) correlators [11],[12] arranged in a cascade to
combine all correlation operations from received signals and
their delay versions in a previous frame. By taking advantage
of the FDL, the TDLC algorithm can achieve symbol-time
acquisitions within a single symbol duration. In this paper,
performance of the DLC receiver [7], including probability of
detection (PD), mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate
(BER), is analyzed.
II. SIGNAL MODEL
As discussed in [12], the time offset between the p-th and
(p+1)-th transmitted pulses from the k-th user is designed such
that Dk,p = Tf + (ck,[p+1,Nf ] − ck,p) × Tc , where [•] is a
modular operation. The transmitted signal from the k-th user
is given by
sk(t) =
∞∑
i=−∞
Nf−1∑
j=0
(dk,i)jw(t−iTs−ck,0Tc−
j−1∑
p=0
Dk,p), (1)
where k is the user index; i is the symbol index; j is the
frame index; dk,i ∈ {+1,−1} is the data sequence for the kth
active user; w(t) is the transmitted pulse waveform; Ts is the
symbol duration; Tf is the pulse repetition time; {ck,j}Nf−1j=0
is the time hopping (TH) code; Tc is the chip duration;
and
−1∑
p=0
Dk,p = 0 is defined. Each symbol is transmitted in
Nf successive frames with one pulse per frame and the jth
transmitted pulse of the ith symbol is modulated by (dk,i)j .
The multipath channel corresponding to each user k is
modeled as a tap delay line with Lk+1 taps, whose amplitudes
{αk,l}Lkl=0 and delays {τk,l}Lkl=0 are invariant over one symbol
duration. The channel impulse response is given by
hk(t) =
Lk∑
l=0
αk,lδ(t− τk − τk,l), (2)
where τk,l = 0 and τk,l < τk,l+1 are defined; τk ∈ [0, Ts) is
the asynchronous time between the clock of the signal received
from the k-th user and the receiver clock. The maximum delay
spread is τk,l.
The aggregated waveforms from all active users at the
3where ti = (i + 1)Ts + τk + ε + ck,0Tc and Tw is the
integration interval. Notably, the Tw value should be designed
appropriately to optimize the performance of the proposed
synchronization algorithm.
We assume τk,l1 − τk,l2 > Tp, ∀l1 6= l2, where Tp is
the pulse duration of w(t). Therefore, w(t + ε − τk,l1) and
w(t+ε−τk,l2) are uncorrelated while l1 6= l2. Thus, Equation
(11) is reduced to
B[i] = (Nf )(dk,i)
Lk∑
l=0
α2k,l
∫ Tw

w2(t+ε−τk,l)dt+Ψ(ti+Tw).
(12)
By continuously integrating the combinative output signal
provided by the proposed FDL, the integrated output has
a marked increasing or decreasing transition when the first
signal per symbol arrives. The symbol boundary can be simply
derived by accurately detecting the time of the rising or falling
edge. The presented TDLC algorithm in [7] can achieve timing
synchronization within a single symbol duration. Notably, the
α(t) in [7] is recast as α(t, Tw) in this article because the α(t)
is related to Tw [13].
As shown in Figure 1, α(t, Tw) is defined by subtracting
z(t− Tw) from z(t), and is given as
α(t, Tw) = z(t)− z(t− Tw)

Figure 2 presents simulation results for z(t) and α(t, Tw).
If Ψ(t) is ignored and t = (i + 1)Ts + τk + ck,0Tc + Tw
is satisfied, α(t, Tw) exhibits a local maximum for each
symbol index i with dk,i = 1; or α(t, Tw) exhibits a local
minimum for each symbol index i with dk,i = −1. We assume
the time at which α(t, Tw) exhibits its local maximum or
minimum within the (i+1)-th symbol period is denoted as
t̂max(i + 1, Tw). Therefore, the true symbol boundary, i.e.,
tsymbol(i+1) = (i+1)Ts+τk, can be determined by acquiring
the t̂max(i + 1, Tw) − ck,0Tc − Tw in each symbol period.
Without loss generality, if dk,i = 1 is assumed, the time
at which α(t, Tw) exhibits a local maximum in the (i+1)-th
symbol period is given by
t̂max(i+ 1, Tw) = arg max
(i+1)Ts<t≤(i+2)Ts+Tw
(
α(t, Tw)
)
.
(17)
After t̂max(i+ 1, Tw) has been acquired, the estimated
first arrival signal time in the (i+1)-th symbol period,
t̂signal(i+ 1, Tw), can then be derived by
t̂signal(i+ 1, Tw) = t̂max(i+ 1, Tw)− Tw. (18)
Finally, the estimated symbol boundary t̂symbol(i+ 1) of the
(i+1)-th symbol can be derived by
t̂symbol(i+ 1, Tw) = t̂signal(i+ 1, Tw)− ck,0Tc. (19)

fn∗(y|ετ )
∏

(∫ y

(31)
We assume the timing synchronization is achieved when
−T∆ ≤ ετ < T∆ is satisfied; thus, PD is defined as
Pd = pd(n∗|ετ ,−T∆ ≤ ετ < T∆). (32)
As −T∆ ≤ ετ < T∆, there are two possible values for n∗ that
could satisfy the inequality, −T∆ ≤ τk+Tw+ck,0Tc−n∗T∆ <
T∆. Thus, the PD for coarse timing acquisitions are given by
Pd = pd(n∗1|ετ ) + pd(n∗2|ετ ), (33)
where n∗1 and n
∗
2 satisfy −T∆ ≤ τk+Tw+ck,0Tc−n∗1T∆ < 0
and 0 ≤ τk + Tw + ck,0Tc − n∗T∆ < T∆.
Moreover, we assume ετ is uniformly distributed over
the interval [−T∆, T∆). Thus, PD can then be derived by
averaging all possible ετ values over the interval [−T∆, T∆),
and is thus given by

Through the central limit theorem, Aετ ,k[n] can be treated as a

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
The multipath channels are generated using the UWB chan-
nel models proposed by IEEE 802.15.3a [15], with parameters
(1/Λ, 1/λ, Γ , γ )=(42.9, 0.4, 7.1, 4.3) ns. The channel impulse
response is assumed to be invariant over two successive
symbol periods, since the TDT algorithms are inoperable as
the channel impulse response is changed over the ”pair” of
symbols. For each user k, we assume the propagation delay
of the first arrival signal, τk, is uniformly distributed over
[0, Ts) ns, with symbol period Ts = NfTf . Each symbol
contains Nf = 32 frames. The frame period Tf is NcTc, where
Nc = 36 and Tc = 1 ns. For the desired user (indexed as 0), a
decimal TH code {c0,j}Nf−1j=0 is selected from c0,j ∈ [0, Nc)
that satisfies D0,p 6= D0,q , ∀p 6= q. The remaining users
are assigned random TH codes uniformly distributed over
[0, Nc). The pulse duration is specified as Tp = 1 ns and the
receiver bandwidth specified as Bw = 1Tp GHz. We assume
a pulse level alignment, thus the effects of pulse shapes are
not taken into account in the simulations. The SNR, shown as
the horizontal axis in following figures, denotes the SNR of
received signals, and it is given by SNRRec = EbNfNo .
Figure 3 compares the BER of the DLC receiver with
that of the dirty template (DT) receiver under a perfect
timing synchronization (ε=0). Moreover, the theoretical result
obtained by Equation (27) is also compared to the simulation
results. The BER performance of DLC receivers is better than
DT receivers, especially in a multiuser environment. Notably,
the BERs are obviously impacted by the number of users, due
to the TH codes for other users being randomly generated.
The BER can be improved significantly when orthogonal TH
codes are selected for other users.
Figure 4 plots the sensitivity of the BER to the timing

Abstract— We proposed a timing synchronization algorithm
designed as ”Timing with Delay Line Combination” (TDLC)
for impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) systems. In that
article, a delay line combination (DLC) receiver is introduced
to combine all correlation operations of received signals and
their delay versions in a previous frame. By taking advantage
of the DLC receiver, the synchronization scheme can achieve
symbol timing synchronization within a single symbol duration.
In this paper, the performance of the IR-UWB systems with DLC
receiver, including probability of detection (PD), mean square
error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER), is investigated.
Index Terms— Synchronization, modulation, delay line combi-
nation (DLC), impulse radio (IR), ultra-wideband (UWB).
I. INTRODUCTION
A time-hopping impulse radio (TH-IR) UWB system wasintroduced by Scholtz in 1993 [1]. The TH-IR UWB
system does not utilize a sinusoidal carrier to raise the signal
to a frequency band in which signals propagate well, but rather
communicates with trains of time-hopping baseband pulses
on the order of sub-nanoseconds. Since pulse durations are
very short, multipaths are resolvable down to path differential
delays on the order of ≤1 nanosecond (ns). The high time
resolution significantly reduces fading effects even in indoor
environments [2]-[4], and makes TH-IR UWB systems viable
candidates for short-range or indoor wireless communications.
However, ultra-fine time resolution also increased the design
challenges in timing synchronization and signal energy collec-
tion. Many studies have attempted to resolve synchronization
issues in TH-IR UWB systems [5]-[10]. Yang and Giannakis
[5] presented a symbol differential synchronization scheme
named timing with dirty templates (TDT). The synchronization
criterion of TDT exploits the fact that the cross-correlation
of these ”dirty templates” exhibits a unique maximum at the
correct symbol time. Although TDT algorithms are effective,
they are inoperable in multi-user environments without as-
signing a specific training pattern for each user. In [6], the
author of this dissertation presented a parallel search syn-
chronization scheme (PS-SLD) for frame-differential IR-UWB
receivers. The parallel search mechanism reduces the search
region of symbol boundaries to only a single frame duration.
Moreover, only one delay element is needed in each branch
as a shared looped delay-line (SLD) is utilized to reduce the
implementation complexity of the parallel search mechanism.
Furthermore, the author of this dissertation presented a more

the contract number NSC98-2218-E-251-001-.
effective synchronization scheme called ”timing with delay-
line combination (TDLC)” algorithm [7]. In that paper a novel
receiver front-end, called a frame differential delay-line (FDL)
was proposed. The FDL resembles a series of transmitted-
reference (TR) correlators [11],[12] arranged in a cascade to
combine all correlation operations from received signals and
their delay versions in a previous frame. By taking advantage
of the FDL, the TDLC algorithm can achieve symbol-time
acquisitions within a single symbol duration. In this paper,
performance of the DLC receiver [7], including probability of
detection (PD), mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate
(BER), is analyzed.
II. SIGNAL MODEL
As discussed in [12], the time offset between the p-th and
(p+1)-th transmitted pulses from the k-th user is designed such
that Dk,p = Tf + (ck,[p+1,Nf ] − ck,p) × Tc , where [•] is a
modular operation. The transmitted signal from the k-th user
is given by
sk(t) =
∞∑
i=−∞
Nf−1∑
j=0
(dk,i)jw(t−iTs−ck,0Tc−
j−1∑
p=0
Dk,p), (1)
where k is the user index; i is the symbol index; j is the
frame index; dk,i ∈ {+1,−1} is the data sequence for the kth
active user; w(t) is the transmitted pulse waveform; Ts is the
symbol duration; Tf is the pulse repetition time; {ck,j}Nf−1j=0
is the time hopping (TH) code; Tc is the chip duration;
and
−1∑
p=0
Dk,p = 0 is defined. Each symbol is transmitted in
Nf successive frames with one pulse per frame and the jth
transmitted pulse of the ith symbol is modulated by (dk,i)j .
The multipath channel corresponding to each user k is
modeled as a tap delay line with Lk+1 taps, whose amplitudes
{αk,l}Lkl=0 and delays {τk,l}Lkl=0 are invariant over one symbol
duration. The channel impulse response is given by
hk(t) =
Lk∑
l=0
αk,lδ(t− τk − τk,l), (2)
where τk,l = 0 and τk,l < τk,l+1 are defined; τk ∈ [0, Ts) is
the asynchronous time between the clock of the signal received
from the k-th user and the receiver clock. The maximum delay
spread is τk,l.
The aggregated waveforms from all active users at the
3where ti = (i + 1)Ts + τk + ε + ck,0Tc and Tw is the
integration interval. Notably, the Tw value should be designed
appropriately to optimize the performance of the proposed
synchronization algorithm.
We assume τk,l1 − τk,l2 > Tp, ∀l1 6= l2, where Tp is
the pulse duration of w(t). Therefore, w(t + ε − τk,l1) and
w(t+ε−τk,l2) are uncorrelated while l1 6= l2. Thus, Equation
(11) is reduced to
B[i] = (Nf )(dk,i)
Lk∑
l=0
α2k,l
∫ Tw

w2(t+ε−τk,l)dt+Ψ(ti+Tw).
(12)
By continuously integrating the combinative output signal
provided by the proposed FDL, the integrated output has
a marked increasing or decreasing transition when the first
signal per symbol arrives. The symbol boundary can be simply
derived by accurately detecting the time of the rising or falling
edge. The presented TDLC algorithm in [7] can achieve timing
synchronization within a single symbol duration. Notably, the
α(t) in [7] is recast as α(t, Tw) in this article because the α(t)
is related to Tw [13].
As shown in Figure 1, α(t, Tw) is defined by subtracting
z(t− Tw) from z(t), and is given as
α(t, Tw) = z(t)− z(t− Tw)

Figure 2 presents simulation results for z(t) and α(t, Tw).
If Ψ(t) is ignored and t = (i + 1)Ts + τk + ck,0Tc + Tw
is satisfied, α(t, Tw) exhibits a local maximum for each
symbol index i with dk,i = 1; or α(t, Tw) exhibits a local
minimum for each symbol index i with dk,i = −1. We assume
the time at which α(t, Tw) exhibits its local maximum or
minimum within the (i+1)-th symbol period is denoted as
t̂max(i + 1, Tw). Therefore, the true symbol boundary, i.e.,
tsymbol(i+1) = (i+1)Ts+τk, can be determined by acquiring
the t̂max(i + 1, Tw) − ck,0Tc − Tw in each symbol period.
Without loss generality, if dk,i = 1 is assumed, the time
at which α(t, Tw) exhibits a local maximum in the (i+1)-th
symbol period is given by
t̂max(i+ 1, Tw) = arg max
(i+1)Ts<t≤(i+2)Ts+Tw
(
α(t, Tw)
)
.
(17)
After t̂max(i+ 1, Tw) has been acquired, the estimated
first arrival signal time in the (i+1)-th symbol period,
t̂signal(i+ 1, Tw), can then be derived by
t̂signal(i+ 1, Tw) = t̂max(i+ 1, Tw)− Tw. (18)
Finally, the estimated symbol boundary t̂symbol(i+ 1) of the
(i+1)-th symbol can be derived by
t̂symbol(i+ 1, Tw) = t̂signal(i+ 1, Tw)− ck,0Tc. (19)
5function (pdf) of Aετ ,k[n] is fn(y|ετ ). The PD for every n∗
based on a determined ετ can be expressed as
pd(n∗|ετ ) =
∫ ∞
−∞
fn∗(y|ετ )
∏
n6=n∗
(∫ y
−∞
fn(x|ετ )dx
)
dy.
(31)
We assume the timing synchronization is achieved when
−T∆ ≤ ετ < T∆ is satisfied; thus, PD is defined as
Pd = pd(n∗|ετ ,−T∆ ≤ ετ < T∆). (32)
As −T∆ ≤ ετ < T∆, there are two possible values for n∗ that
could satisfy the inequality, −T∆ ≤ τk+Tw+ck,0Tc−n∗T∆ <
T∆. Thus, the PD for coarse timing acquisitions are given by
Pd = pd(n∗1|ετ ) + pd(n∗2|ετ ), (33)
where n∗1 and n
∗
2 satisfy −T∆ ≤ τk+Tw+ck,0Tc−n∗1T∆ < 0
and 0 ≤ τk + Tw + ck,0Tc − n∗T∆ < T∆.
Moreover, we assume ετ is uniformly distributed over
the interval [−T∆, T∆). Thus, PD can then be derived by
averaging all possible ετ values over the interval [−T∆, T∆),
and is thus given by
Pd=

Through the central limit theorem, Aετ ,k[n] can be treated as a
Gaussian distribution, with a mean and variance of mn(Aετ ,k)
and σ2n(Aετ ,k), respectively. Thus, the lower bound in Equa-

The time offset between the estimated index (n̂) and target
index (n∗) is defined as eετ (n̂) = ετ+(n̂−n∗)T∆. Therefore,
the MSE can be expressed as
JMSE(ετ ) =

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
The multipath channels are generated using the UWB chan-
nel models proposed by IEEE 802.15.3a [15], with parameters
(1/Λ, 1/λ, Γ , γ )=(42.9, 0.4, 7.1, 4.3) ns. The channel impulse
response is assumed to be invariant over two successive
symbol periods, since the TDT algorithms are inoperable as
the channel impulse response is changed over the ”pair” of
symbols. For each user k, we assume the propagation delay
of the first arrival signal, τk, is uniformly distributed over
[0, Ts) ns, with symbol period Ts = NfTf . Each symbol
contains Nf = 32 frames. The frame period Tf is NcTc, where
Nc = 36 and Tc = 1 ns. For the desired user (indexed as 0), a
decimal TH code {c0,j}Nf−1j=0 is selected from c0,j ∈ [0, Nc)
that satisfies D0,p 6= D0,q , ∀p 6= q. The remaining users
are assigned random TH codes uniformly distributed over
[0, Nc). The pulse duration is specified as Tp = 1 ns and the
receiver bandwidth specified as Bw = 1Tp GHz. We assume
a pulse level alignment, thus the effects of pulse shapes are
not taken into account in the simulations. The SNR, shown as
the horizontal axis in following figures, denotes the SNR of
received signals, and it is given by SNRRec = EbNfNo .
Figure 3 compares the BER of the DLC receiver with
that of the dirty template (DT) receiver under a perfect
timing synchronization (ε=0). Moreover, the theoretical result
obtained by Equation (27) is also compared to the simulation
results. The BER performance of DLC receivers is better than
DT receivers, especially in a multiuser environment. Notably,
the BERs are obviously impacted by the number of users, due
to the TH codes for other users being randomly generated.
The BER can be improved significantly when orthogonal TH
codes are selected for other users.
Figure 4 plots the sensitivity of the BER to the timing
