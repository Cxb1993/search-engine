using the CCS-PRBG with purturbance 
decreases a little, but its security is good 
enough to resist all known attacks and 
its key space is still very large. The AES 
scheme and the proposed scheme were 
compared by testing them on images:  
The encryption time of the later 
compared with that of the former 
decreases from 1.935159 (sec) to 
0.348148 (sec). Experiments show that 
the proposed scheme has good statistical 
properties, it passes FIPS 140-1 test, and 
has linear complexity profile. Therefore, 
our proposed scheme reduces the 
processing time for encryption but not 
sacrifices security. 
 
一. 緣由與目的 
Generally chaos can be regarded as 
unpredictability, and is the complexity 
of causality or the relationship between 
events. It means that any apparently 
insignificant event in the system has the 
potential to trigger a chain reaction that 
will change the whole system. The 
weather variation is one of the examples 
in chaos phenomenon. The well known 
statement about this phenomenon is “A 
butterfly flapping its wings in one part 
of the world can cause a hurricane on 
the other side of the earth.” This is 
also known as the butterfly effect. 
Since 1990s, many researchers 
have found that there exists some 
interesting relationship between chaos 
and cryptography. Because chaotic 
systems have the properties of 
sensitivity to initial conditions and 
control parameters, pseudo-randomness 
and ergodicity, chaos-based image 
encryption algorithms have become 
popular for applications. Although many 
good traditional ciphers have been 
widely used, such as AES, DES, RC5 
and etc, most of them are not suitable for 
large-scale data encryption, including 
audio, image and video data, because the 
encryption speed is not fast enough to 
meet real-time, especially when they are 
realized by software. Compared with 
traditional ciphers, the ones based on 
chaos can be realized easily, this make 
designing a fast chaotic encryption 
algorithm without loss of security 
become possible. 
In digital images, uncompressed 
image data have particular properties as 
follows: bulk capacity, high redundancy 
and high correlation among pixels. The 
property of bulk capacity will avail an 
attacker enough ciphertext samples for 
statistical analysis. The property of high 
redundancy or high correlation that 
adjacent pixels have similar values will 
result in information leakage. Huge size 
of uncompressed image data makes 
real-time encryption difficult. This is the 
reason that we prefer to encrypt 
compressed images. The main challenge 
of compressed image encryption is how 
to obtain reasonable security when we 
reduce the computation complexity and 
maintain the compression performance. 
JPEG2000 is a novel still image 
compression standard. Compared with 
JPEG, it can eliminate the block effect

compliant encryption scheme 
 
The counter mode AES employed in 
[3] is not efficient. Therefore, we 
replace it by the proposed chaotic key 
stream generator (called CCS-PRBG 
with perturbance) to increase the 
processing speed. chaotic maps 
implemented by computers with finite 
precision will lead to dynamic 
degradation. The dynamic degradation 
will cause the practical behavior of a 
chaotic system vastly different from the 
theoretical one. For example, problems 
such as cycle length, non-ideal 
distribution and correlation. These 
problems reduce the cryptosystem 
security strength greatly and the 
generated sequence may not be used as 
the key stream. In this project we 
modified the pseudo-random bit 
generator based on couple chaotic 
systems called CCS-PRBG proposed by 
S. Li [17] to enhance cryptographic 
properties such as cycle length and 
statistical properties so that it can be 
used to construct our stream ciphers 
with higher security. The diagram of the 
proposed CCS-PRBG with disturbance 
is shown in Fig. 2.

三. 研究結果 
 Experimental results are given in 
this section to demonstrate our proposed 
algorithm. A standard 512 512  BMP 
format image (Lena) is compressed into  
a JPC format image with compression 
rate 0.5 and the number of resolution 
levels 4, and the result is used in our 
encryption scheme. Fig. 3 shows the 
encrypted and decrypted results 
respectively. In Tables 1, the encrypting 
time for Lena by using our proposed 
scheme is compared with the one by the 
AES counter mode. The encrypted 
image shown in Fig. 3 is compared with 
the original one. Obviously, there is no 
visual information in the encrypted 
image and the PSNR of the encrypted

Testing for compliance with FIPS 
140-1 is carried out with sequences of 
20000 bits. Three sequences, 1,S 2S and 
3S were generated using the parameters 
shown in Table 2. The results of the test 
on the sequences are shown in Table 3.

According to the key definition, we 
can calculate the key space size in our 
encryption scheme.  
1. When 1 2(0) (0)x x , the key space 
size is calculated as  
32 32 32 31 31(2 2 2 ) (2 1) (2 1)      
16 17 50(2 1) (2 1) 256 1.871 10     
 
2. When 1 2p p  , the key space size is 
calculated as  
32 32 31 31 31
16 17 50
(2 2 ) [(2 1) (2 1) (2 1)]
(2 1) (2 1) 256 1.871 10
      
        
According to the calculation, the key 
space size is near . Therefore, the key 
space size is large enough to resist 
brute-force attacks in our encryption 
scheme [1]. 
In order to demonstrate the key 
sensitivity of our encryption scheme, we 
test the performance with one of the 
parameters being slightly changed. The
