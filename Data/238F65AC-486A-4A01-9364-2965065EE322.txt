A crate diagram can be found based on controllability invariant and controllability
indices i. In this research work, an m-file ALMU.M is implemented by MATLAB software,
subjecting to the following features:
1. Controllability indices: {1,2, . . .p }
2. Controllability invariant:= max{i }
3. j

A generic output vector (t) := [ 1(t), 2(t), . . ., p(t)]T can be expressed as a linear
combination of x(t), addressed as hypothetical output. Let
(t) = H x(t) (A4)

Here hi, plays as the role of observability probe, is a non-zero row n-vector. The purpose of
this choice for H is to make the system {A, B, H} preserve observability from the
hypothetical output(t), under any state feedback design, via the loop decoupling framework.
The transfer function matrix (TFM) from u to will be all-pole, i.e. the TMF contains no
finite zeros.
The choice of H will be as follows. There exists a particular H such that,
