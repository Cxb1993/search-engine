摘要 
鎳鈷元素因其原子直徑相近，故鎳鈷合金之固溶強化效果很小，適用於探討疊差能對
其機械性質之影響。鎳之疊差能隨著鈷元素之添加而降低，本研究製作不同成分之鎳鈷合

低疊差能之奈米晶鎳鈷合金具較小之晶粒尺寸、高差排及雙晶密度，而此微觀結構具較高

Abstract 
Co-Ni alloy has very small solution-hardening effect and is, therefore, perfect for studying 
the effect of stacking fault energy on the mechanical properties. Nanostructured (NS) Co-Ni alloy 
samples were processed by high-pressure torsion + rolling. The addition of cobalt to nickel 
reduces the stacking fault energy (SFE) in nickel. The microstructure analysis shows that the low 
SFE can refine grain size, increase dislocation density and twin density. The NS Co-Ni alloys 
were then tested under tension. It was found that low SFE alloy has high tensile stress and 
elongation. Higher tensile stress is the result of smaller grain size in the low SFE alloy. The better 
ductility in the low SFE alloy can be attributed to higher work hardening rate, which is caused by 
more stacking fault ribbons and twins intersecting with slip dislocations as well as inhibiting 
dynamic recovery.  
Keywords: Ultrafine-grained material, severe plastic deformation, high pressure torsion, stacking 
fault energy, mechanical property 
The Ni-40wt.%Co alloy and Ni-65wt.% Co alloy represent high and low SFE materials, 
respectively. The Co-Ni alloys were machined into discs of 1mm thickness and 10mm diameter. 
Discs were then subjected to HPT for 5 turns at 1 turn/min under 6 GPa followed by cold-rolling 
to a thin ribbon with a thickness of 0.2mm (80% rolling reduction) at room temperature.  
The as-deformed specimens were mechanically thinned to a thickness of ~80μm and final 
thinning was done by Ar+ ion milling at 4 keV ion energy. Microstructure was characterized in a 
Philips CM200 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 200keV. Dark field images were 
employed to determine the grain sizes. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were 
also recorded in both alloys from regions with diameter of 1μm. These patterns were used to 
determine the boundary misorientation angle. 
Quantitative X-ray diffraction measurements of the samples were performed using an X-ray 
diffractometer equipped with a Cu target. The Cu Kα radiation was selected at the goniometer 
receiving slit section. The θ-2θ scans were performed to provide a record of the XRD patterns at 
room temperature. Pure Al annealed at 400oC was used as an XRD peak-broadening reference for 
both the grain size and the microstrain calculations. The peak parameters, including peak intensity, 
the peak-maximum position, the full width at half maximum and the integral breadth, were 
determined by fitting a Pearson VII function to the measured peaks. The XRD results were 
averaged from the whole ribbon samples.  
Tensile test samples were machined from the cold-rolled samples to have a gauge length of 
10mm, width of 2mm and thickness of 0.2mm. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on the 
samples with the initial strain rate of ~10-4/s at 298K. After tensile tests, the fracture surface of 
the samples was observed in a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope 
(FESEM) at 10keV.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
The typical as-deformed microstructures of the two alloys are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen 
that both samples have high strain field, indicative of high dislocation densities. The majority of 
grains have equiaxed shape. Twins are observed in the grain interiors in both alloys. It is found 
that more twins appear in the Ni-65wt.%Co alloy than the Ni-40wt.%Co alloy. The grain sizes 
between them in low SFE materials. It is more difficult for full dislocations to cross slip or 
climb when encountering barriers, and this subsequently reduces the recovery rate. As a result, 
lower SFE usually leads to a higher work hardening rate.  
2. Work hardening rate can also be increased by interaction of the slipping dislocations with the 
wide stacking faults in low SFE materials. 
3. Lower SFE makes it easier for deformation twins to form. It has been demonstrated that 
deformation twins can be formed from the overlap of wide stacking fault ribbons, successive 
emission of partials from the grain boundaries and self-propagation via cross slip [32]. 
Therefore, the high twin density in the Ni-65wt.%Co alloy should help raising its work 
hardening rate. Additionally, the twins can act as dislocation barriers and contribute to higher 
strength.  
The low SFE Ni-65wt.%Co alloy has smaller grain size, higher dislocation density and twin 
density than the Ni-40wt.%Co alloy. As a result, the lower SFE causes the Ni-65wt.%Co alloys to 
have high tensile strength and ductility combination. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The following conclusions can be drawn from this work:  
1. The effect of SFE on the microstructure is observed. Grain size decreases with decreasing 
SFE while dislocation density and twin density increase with decreasing SFE.  
2. Low SFE Ni-Co alloy has higher tensile stress due to smaller grain size, high dislocation 
density and higher twin density.  
3. Low SFE Ni-Co alloy exhibits higher strain hardening rate to higher strain and therefore has 
higher tensile elongation. 
4. By excluding the solid solution effect, the effect of SFE becomes clear. The lower SFE in NS 
Ni-Co alloy can simultaneously increase its strength and tensile ductility.

此會議之規模相當大，分為五十六個組別，共有超過 2200 篇的論文。大家於為期五天的會議
中，以口頭或張貼海報的方式輪番發表。今年本會吸引全世界約 3000 人以上參加，為全球性
之材料科學研討會。本人所參加之 section 為 Ultrafine-Grained Materials: Fifth International 
Symposium，共有 130 篇論文發表，其中 77 篇為口頭發表，53 篇為壁報展示。 
經由此次會議可發現，目前大家用於製造 ultrafine-grained materials 之 SPD (severe plastic 
deformation)方式仍以等徑轉角擠型(equal channel angular extrusion, ECAE)及高壓扭轉變形
(high pressure torsion, HPT)為主。而相較於 ultrafine-grained materials 剛發展之初，大家只著重
於 ultrafine-grained materials 的製作，此次會議以研究其變形組織、提升其延展性及解釋
