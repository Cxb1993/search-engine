2二、緣由與目的
本計畫構想乃是應用計畫主持人過去之
研究專利[1]，創新應用於醫學工程之骨質
疏鬆(osteoporosis)之量化檢測，由於構想較
目前所使用之檢測法有相當程度之不同，
故擬分期執行以減少計畫之風險，該構想
之理論背景將於本計畫書之第肆部份，詳
細說明。
隨著醫學科技之進步，人類之壽命雖然
延長，但相對地所謂之「骨質疏鬆」併發
症，也逐漸的普遍，依據世界衛生組織
WHO之定義：所謂的正常骨質、骨質疏鬆
等，都是以統計資料、距離年輕之成年平
均 BMD (Bone Mineral Density) 或 BMC
(Bone Mineral Content) 值之來顯示，因
此，進一步思考時，我們可以得到兩個結
論：(1)以「年輕之成人(young adult)」之平
均值(或以年齡來界定)來定義骨質疏鬆與
否、是否有骨折之潛在危機，顯然不夠精
準，這當然與量測工具有關，如果無法精
準地掌握骨質密度之絕對單位，以統計平
均值為基準，也不失為一種可以接受的方
法；(2)骨質密度是以間接方式呈現，如表
1 中之 T-score，也即無法真正地提出骨質
密度或骨骼強度多寡，而是以骨頭內含有
之礦物質多寡來間皆呈現和定義，然而，
骨骼之生物力學強度。以科學或工程而
言，兩者都有進一步努力之空間，有鑑於
此，本研究以超音波為量測介質，嘗試以
振動理論為背景，創新建立一套可直接量
測骨骼機械性質(mechanical properties)之
新量測方法。
整理文獻後，發現幾個重點：(1)UT 或
QUS 目前之功能，必須以各種族之統計標
準模版比對，因此，對數據之解讀上，需
要依賴專業醫生來協助，一般民眾較難理
解；(2)最進步之 QUS(即所謂之 “QUS”)
仍然無法做到將檢測量即時以物理量顯
示；而且，(3)絕大多數之報告僅在末端之
使用 QUS、或病患狀態與統計、比對，對
於 QUS 根本之原理、準確與否等設備資
訊，大都沒有交代。有鑒於此，本計劃主
持人以為：與過去幾年前之「血壓計」一
般，超音波骨質檢驗設備仍被視為「醫療」
用，但曾幾何時，由於工業水準的進步，
直接顯示血壓值之血壓計就自自然然地進
入家庭，成為家庭保健之必備儀器之一，
相信價廉之 QUS也會如此，因此有投入研
究之潛在市場價值。
有鑑於此，本計畫構想中，針對目前研
究報告中所使用或提出之探針彈簧常數各
種校準方法進行調查，結果發現，方法雖
然很多，但是，各有其優缺點，值得具有
工程背景者，特別是有結構與分子動態行
為背景者，加入研究，以創新之手法提出
更實用之校準方法。

如同前言所敘述，本計畫之關鍵技術係

ABSTRACT 
The main objective of the report is to present a new 
identification method has been derived for single-degree, base-
excited systems. The system is actually to mimic a probe of 
cantilever type of AFMs. In fact, the idea of the present report 
was initiated by needs for in situ spring constant calibration for 
such probe systems.  Calibration processes can be treated as 
parameter identification for the stiffness of the probe before it 
is used. However, sine a real probe is too small to be seen by 
bare eyes and too costly to verify, a cantilever beam was 
adopted to replace it during the study. The present method 
starts with giving a chirp excitation to the target system, and to 
lock the damped natural frequency. Once the damped natural 
frequency is obtained, it is possible to locate the frequency at 
which the phase lag is equal to /2. From which, the excitation 
frequency is then purposely changed to that frequency and the 
corresponding steady-state responses are measured. In the 
meantime, the system dissipative energy or power may also 
need to be stored. In fact, the present identification formulation 
is to express the spring constant of the target systems in terms 
of two measurable parameters: the phase angle and the system 
damping. The former can be computed from the damped 
natural frequency while the latter can be identified along with 
measuring the input power. The novel formulation is then 
numerically simulated using the Simulink toolbox of 
MATLAB. The simulation results clearly showed the current 
identification method can work with good accuracy. Following 
the numerical simulation, experimental measurements were 
also carried out by a cantilever beam that its free end was 
immersed to viscid fluids. The fluids of different viscosity were 
used to mimic the environments of a probe in use. The 
experimental results again substantiated the correctness of the 
present method. Thus it is accordingly concluded that the new 
recognition algorithm can be applied with confidence.   
INTRODUCTION 
 Calibration of the spring constant for the cantilever probe 
of atomic force microscopes (AFM) is necessary for lots of 
applications.  And there is an increasing need for the accurate 
measurement of small forces, particularly for researches in 
surface science.  Using a probe without careful calibration or 
direct applying the data from suppliers normally leads to very 
large errors in force measurements.  During the last decade, a 
number of calibration methods have been developed and 
reviewed [1] for calibration of various applications. In general, 
those calibration methods for a cantilever probe may be divided 
into a few major approaches based on their technical principles.  
They include like methods using geometric dimensions 
together with FEA, dynamic or static response methods, 
comparison with a reference quantity, and thermal noise 
methods, etc.   
 Methods using the physical dimensions as well as material 
properties may be the simplest, even though they may not be 
the most accurate ones.  By applying the well-known Euler-
Bernoulli beam theory, it is possible to obtain a reasonable 
spring constant for that cantilever probe. However, since 
probes are made by utilizing an MEMS process, the physical 
dimensions are not as homogenous as one has expected.  For 
example, the thickness of cantilevers, which are in cubic 
relation to the spring constant, may result in as high as 50% 
error [2]. Hence, applying one of these methods may be a good 
reference but not that practical. In addition, to measure the true 
dimensions of a probe, compute its spring constant, and then 
mount it on the probe clip seems to increase the possibility of 
damaging that probe. However, [3] has applied such calibration

if the excitation from the bimorph is u(t), where m, c, and k are 
the equivalent mass, damping and stiffness of the cantilever,

Examining eqns (7) and (8), the transmissibility and the phase 
lag are function of r and , and cannot be known unless the 
correct damping ratio is precisely measured a priori.   
In order to identify the damping ratio of a structural 
system, several methods have been developed by the first 
author [e.g., 17], in addition to a lot of ones.  Here, however, 
one is to apply an excitation with its frequency  in such way 
that the phase angle  is purposely equal to /2 (or 90).  That 
is, let the frequency where  = /2 be 0, i.e., the present 
method is to urge the experimenter to set  = 0 in eqn (8).  
Under this circumstance, the denominator of eqn (8) is actually 
cos , and hence cos   0 at  = 0.  Or, the denominator of 
eqn (8) has to satisfy

where Q is the system quality factor.  Here, one has defined 
d is the so-called damped natural frequency, which can be 
experimentally measured by a chirp or wide-band excitation.   
On the other hand, because the present method requires 
the frequency of the external excitations to be exactly at 0, the 
phase angle must satisfy tan  .  Equivalently, it mathe-
matically means that not only the denominator of eqn (8) must 
be zero, but also the numerator has to be an arbitrary non-zero 
constant. Therefore, one writes

in which  represents an unknown, non-zero, real constant.  
Solving eqn (13), one at least can have a set of solution that 
satisfies

By using equation (5) which is the definition of the natural

Substituting this expression back into eqn (14), this allows one 
to identify the probe spring constant k, in addition to m as a 
function 0:  
   20 0( ) 1 k c Q    . (16) 
The formulation in eqn (16) is exact and good for  = 0.  To 
the best of authors’ knowledge, this expression has not been 
attempted in literature. And the formulation is an “almost” 
close form, since the only assumption made is in eqn (12) for 
the quality factor through the derivation.  Alternately, one may 
writes the estimated spring constant k in eqn (16) in terms of d 
which can be directly measured as

Unfortunately, notice that from either eqn (16) or (17), one can 
experimentally or indirectly obtain all parameters on RHS 
except system damping c.  Or, unless the probe damping is 
known, the two expressions, both involve one unknown, are 
not much helpful in identifying system stiffness.  Thus, one 
has to recognize the system damping prior to estimate the 
spring constant.  
2.1 SYSTEM DAMPING: DISSIPATIVE ENERGY 
Theoretically, the total energy involves in every z(t) cycle 
of probe oscillations may be obtained by integrating eqn (1).  
Or,   
 5 Copyright © 2009 by ASME 
In addition to the error sources from the estimated quality 
factor Q and the frequency location 0, one other possible error 
source may be from the measurement of the dissipative power 
or energy.  Refer to Fig. 1, it is quite clear that the bimorph 
actuator of probes also dissipates away certain amount of 
energy during beam oscillations, mostly due to the material 
damping of bimorphs.  Fortunately, this can be reasonably 
measured before probes are mounted onto the clip.  In other 
words, one is first to calibrate the power consumed at 0 
without a probe, i.e., by the bimorph itself.  Let the power 
without a probe be Pb0 and remain constant for the whole 
period of stiffness detection.  And also let the total power 
dissipated after probes mounted be Ptotal.  Then, one is able 
to obtain a good estimation of the dissipative power for the 
probe cantilever itself by subtracting the two [19]:  
  0 total 0bP P P      (30) 
if the air friction to the beam is relatively negligible.  
Otherwise, the product modulation method [20] can be a good 
alternative.    
VERIFICATION BY NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS 
Numerical simulations using the commercial package, 
MATLAB Simulink toolbox, were carried out for confirmation 
of the theoretical derivation in the former section.  The main 
objective was to ensure those formulations could properly work 
for various damped environments.  However, since the size of 
probes for a real AFM is too small to see or to verify by bare 
eyes, the experiment was designed to carry out by a cantilever 
beam that mimics the real AFM probe.  Anticipating the size 
of later experiments, to verify the current calibration method, 
the following system parameters with consistent units, were 
freely given: m = 0.06, c = 0.10 ~ 8.0 (ca. equivalent to  = 0.2 
% ~ 13.3 %), and the system natural frequency fn was set to 
around 80 Hz, i.e., to fix the spring constant at k = 1.50e04.  
The Simulink model, as shown in Fig. 3, was established to 
identify these given values.  
Simulating the calibration procedures, one started with 
finding the natural frequency of the beam. A chirp signal, from 
3 to 250 Hz in 3 sec, was adopted to scan the damped natural 
frequency here. The sampling frequency fs and sampling time T 
were 2 kHz and 5 sec, respectively.  Once the damped natural 
frequency of the cantilever system was locked, the location of 
0 can be easily computed.  Following the chirp excitation, 
the excitation was then changed to 0 so that the steady-state 
responses under that excitation were properly recorded for later 
analyses. In the meantime, it had assumed that the dissipative 
energy could be correctly measured, while it can be calculated 
from the model.  The results are given in Table 1 where the 
notations with over-hat denote estimated values.   
It can be seen clearly from the table that quite small 
percentage of errors for estimated stiffness k.  Even when the 
error in the quality factor, Q , is as large as ca. +6.19 %, the 
present identification method still can correctly recognize the 
probe stiffness with acceptable amount of errors (+5.18 %).  
Notice also that it has a trend that the larger damping tends to 
have a lager error in stiffness estimation. This may mainly 
stems from the approximate form of the Q-sharpness factor in 
eqn (12). Furthermore, when system damping is small, the 
estimated error for stiffness also tends to increase. However, 
the reason is because that discrete numerical simulation is 
normally hard to accurately locate their peaks when system 
responses are very sharp. This is somehow different from those 
of larger damping.  In addition, this also implies that an

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 
In addition to the numerical verifications given in the last 
section, several experimental measurements were carried out.  
The main objective of the experiments is to verify the validity 
of eqn (16) or (17).  The experimental setup for the mea-
surements is shown in Fig. 4.  The test specimen was an 
austenite stainless steel (Young’s modulus E = 210 GPa) 
cantilever with dimensions 1.6T  20.2W  194L mm (ca. 45.68 
g) directly mounted to a shaker by a bolt.  At the end of the 
beam, it was a plastic straw with the length 96 mm and the 
outer diameter 8.6 mm (ca. 2 g) firmly glued to one end of the 
beam.  Meanwhile, in order to simulate the damping forces 
acting on the beam, the straw was inserted into a cup of viscid 
fluid during the experiments.  The depth of submersion was 
set in such a way that the straw was at the depth d when the 
beam at its static equilibrium position. For example, in the case 
of d = 0 mm, the tip of the straw was just about to contact the

Under these circumstances, a large damping at the straw tip 
was simulated.  That is, the dissipative energy from the straw 
might be much higher than that of from the beam itself.  As a 
consequence, the present method recognized a lower spring 
constant for the beam.  Furthermore, similar to the results of 
numerical simulations presented in the last section, low quality 
factors have been noticed that may also include some error 
from other sources as well.

Case 4 and 5 shown in Table 2 represent two strongly 
nonlinear damping systems.  The straw was set slightly above 
the viscid fluid surface when it was in its static equilibrium.  
When the beam started oscillating, one half of the straw 
oscillation stays in the liquid while the other half in air.  The 
former half in fluid stands for a strong damping, while the latter 
one for weakly damped.  Even though the identified results 
shown in the table are still quite reasonable, the possible reason 
may originate from that the present method is actually evaluate 
the equivalent dissipative energy [18].  It does not matter if 
the energy is initiated from linear or nonlinear damping.  
How-ever, it has been found that the main error source of these 
experimental measurements were from determining the location 
of 0. This situation also implies that a robust control algorithm 
may be needed in case of systems with strongly nonlinear 
damping.  Nevertheless, the experimental results once again 
confirmed that the present identification method can 
successfully detect the spring constant of a cantilever beam 
which mimics the probe of AFMs.  However, more studies on 
real AFM probes may be still desired. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
A new identification method has been derived for sdof, 
base-excited systems.  The system is to mimic a cantilever 
probe system of AFMs.  In fact, the idea of the present report 
was initiated by needs for in situ spring constant calibration for 
the probe systems.  Such a calibration process can be treated 
as parameter identification for the stiffness of each probe 
before it is used.  However, sine a real probe is too small and 
costly to verify, a cantilever beam was adopted to replace it 
during the study.  Unlike other existing methods, the present 
method starts with giving a chirp excitation to the system, and 
acquires the corresponding responses that are then used to lock 
the damped natural frequency of the beam.  Once the damped 
natural frequency is obtained, it is possible to compute the 
frequency location where the phase lag is equal to /2 (or 90) 
by using the formulation given in the present report.  From 
which, the present calibration process is to require the external 
excitation frequency purposely changes to that frequency and 
the steady-state responses are stored for the later analyses.  In 
the meantime, the system dissipative energy or power may also 
be experimentally measured for estimation of the probe 
damping.   
In fact, the present identification formulation is to 
express both the stiffness of the target probe in terms of two 
directly measurable parameters.  They are the phase angle as 
well as system damping.  The former can be computed from 
the damped natural frequency and then used to locate the input 
excitation frequency of steady-state responses.  On the other 
hand, the latter can be identified along with measuring the 
input power since the equivalence of the dissipated and input 
energies when the system oscillations are in steady-state.   
After the theoretical derivation, the report also provided 
numerical simulations using the Simulink toolbox of 
MATLAB.  Depending on the error of the quality factor, 
which is a function of the probe damping, the simulated results 
clearly showed the current identification method can work with 
good accuracy.  Following the numerical simulation, 
experimental measure-ments were also carried out by a 
cantilever beam that its free end was immersed to viscid fluids. 
Fluids of different viscosity were used to imitate the 
environments of a probe in use. The experimental results again 
substantiated the validity of the method.  Thus it is 
accordingly concluded that the new recognition algorithm can 
be applied with confidence.  In addition, one summarizes the 
whole calibration procedures as follows:  
(1) Apply a chirp or wide-band signal to scan the location of 
the damped natural frequency of the target system as well 
as the quality factor of the system.   
(2) Use the formulations given in (11) and (12) to compute 
the frequency location where the phase angle equals to 
90.  Denote that frequency as 0.   
(3) Apply external excitation again to the target system but 
with the frequency right at 0 .  
(4) Acquire the steady-state responses, both input and output.  
In case power meter is available, it is recommended to 
measure the dissipative power simultaneously.   
(5) Utilize the equations given in the present report and 
compute the corresponding spring constant of the system.   
(6) Repeat the former steps for checking.
