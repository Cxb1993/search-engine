mixtures passing below the restricted zone (BRZ 
gradation). Moreover, the TRZ gradations exhibit the 
higher fracture toughness in the semi-circular 
bending tests, the lower exponential values in the 
creep compliance tests, and the higher fracture 
energy in the indirect tensile strength tests. All 
results indicate that the TRZ gradations could have a 
better capability against fatigue cracking. However, 
the BRZ gradations reveal the higher dynamic modulus 
observed at longer reduced time in the dynamic 
modulus master curves, the more reduced time required 
to reach the same strain in the repeated loading 
triaxial tests, and the slightly larger value of ψ 
obtained in the triaxial shear tests, all illustrate 
their superior performance against rutting. Based 
upon these experimental results, it can be stated 
that the TRZ gradations exhibit better resistance 
against fatigue cracking, whereas, the BRZ gradations 
possess greater performance in rutting resistance.

Taiwan is incorporated in this study. The physical properties of 
Penetration Grade 60/70 of Asphalt Cement were tested and the 
results are listed in Table 1.  
The aggregates were taken from the Wu-Shi riverbed in central 
Taiwan and the major physical property test results together with 
the criteria are listed in Table 2. The results indicate that all the 
consensus aggregate properties meet the criteria, except that the 
FAA value just fulfills the minimum requirement for the heavy 
traffic level. It indicates that the fine aggregate particles did not 
have sufficient amount of fracture faces.  
Following Superpave Level 1 design procedures, the trial blends 
of the mixture gradation [1] were evaluated and the aggregate 
structures for both BRZ and TRZ gradations of the 19.0 mm 
nominal mixture are established, respectively as shown in Fig. 1. 
After the mixture properties such as air voids, VMA, and VFA 
are calculated, the design asphalt contents for the BRZ and the TRZ 
gradation structures are thus determined as 4.7% and 5.0%, 
respectively. The design mixture properties at design asphalt content 
as well as the criteria for these two gradation mixtures are shown in 
Table 3.

the concept of path independent J-integral was derived by Eshelby 
[5] and subsequently developed by Rice [6] for its application in 
fracture mechanics. This test accounts for the resistance of the 
flawed material to crack propagation. The 150 mm (5.9 in.) by 57 
mm (2.25 in.) high cylindrical specimens were prepared using 
Superpave Gyratory Compactor and the cylindrical specimens was 
sliced along their central axes to form two equal semi-circular 
samples. The semi-circular specimens with different notch depths 
such as 25.4mm, 31.8 mm and 38.0 mm were fabricated using a saw 
blade of 3.0 mm thickness. This test was conducted following the 
test procedures as outlined by Mohammad et al. [7]. A crosshead 
loading rate of 0.5 mm/min was applied on the specimens until the 
fracture fail occurred as shown in Fig. 2. During the test, the load

|E*| : dynamic modulus. 
In this research, shift factors at reference temperature of 25℃ 
were determined. 
 
Permanent Deformation of Repetition Loading Test 
 
The negligible damage specimens which were used in the dynamic 
modulus tests could be reused in the repeated loading triaxial 
permanent deformation tests. In this test, a constant vertical stress of 
826.8 kPa (120 psi) with a loading frequency of 1 Hz was applied 
on the specimen in the confined triaxial cell (confining pressure 
206.7 kPa (30 psi)) at the temperatures of 25, 40, and 55℃, 
respectively. The results of accumulated permanent strain versus 
physical time were simultaneously and continuously recorded until 
the strain of 4% was reached. Subsequently, the strain was replotted 
versus reduced time which was converted from physical time by 
using the time-temperature shift factors obtained from a series of 
complex modulus tests as discussed in the previous section. 
 
Indirect Tensile Creep Compliance Tests (Kim and Wen, 
2002) [13] 
 
The creep compliance determined from the indirect tension creep 
test was used to assess the resistance of the fatigue cracking for the 
asphalt concrete mixtures. The viscoelastic solution for the creep 
compliance was developed from the displacements measured on the 
specimen surface (Kim and Wen 2002) [13]. A set device of 
displacement measurement was used in this study. Vertical and 
horizontal LVDTs with gauge length of 50 mm were 
surface-mounted on both faces of the specimen to eliminate any 
possible stress concentration of the end effect under the loading 
strips as shown in Fig. 4. The linear viscoelastic solution for creep 
compliance D(t) is (Kim and Wen, 2002) [13] : 
 )t(V)t(U
P

)t(D 21                      (5) 
in which 
U(t) : horizontal displacement (mm); 
V(t) : vertical displacement (mm); 
d : specimen thickness (mm); 
P : applied load (N);  
β1, β2 : coefficients which are dependent on gauge length and 
specimen diameter [13]. 
To ensure the magnitude of applied load is within the range of 
linear viscoelastic state during the creep test, the strain was limited 
to 50-100 μ. At temperature of 25℃, a crosshead constant load was 
applied on the specimens for 200 seconds using material testing 
machine. The creep compliance D(t) is determined by using Eq. (5) 
which is based on the average displacement measurement of the 
vertical and horizontal LVDTs on both faces of the specimen. The 
test results of D(t) and time t were simultaneously recorded and 
were plotted on double-log of D(t) versus time t to get the slope of 
the exponential n-value for analysis.

(Jc) expressed as the fracture toughness was then determined by Eq. 
(1). Three triplicate specimens were tested for each notch depth and 
the average test results were used for analysis. The results show that 
the fracture toughness for the BRZ and the TRZ gradations are 1.27 
kJ/m2 and 4.26 kJ/m2, respectively. It indicates that the TRZ 
gradation might demonstrate the higher resistance against crack 
propagation. 
 
Dynamic Complex Modulus Test Results  
 
Dynamic modulus values for each gradation were obtained through 
a series of dynamic complex modulus tests. Following the 
time-temperature superposition principles, shift factors as a function 
of temperature for the TRZ gradation were obtained using Eq. (4) 
and shown in Fig. 8(a). The dynamic modulus as a function of time 
at any temperature could then be shifted as a function of reduced 
time at a desired reference temperature of 25°C to form the dynamic 
modulus master curve.  
The dynamic modulus master curves for both BRZ and TRZ 
gradations were collected together for comparison as plotted in Fig. 
8(b). The results show that the BRZ gradations exhibited the higher 
dynamic modulus at longer reduced times (higher temperature) 
compared to the TRZ gradations. It appears that the BRZ gradation 
could have better performance against rutting.  
 
Permanent Deformation of Repetition Loading Test 
Results 
 
Based on the time-temperature superposition principles, the curves 
of accumulated permanent strain versus physical time up to a strain 
of 4% for different temperatures of 25, 40, and 55°C were shifted to 
the reference temperature of 25°C by using the time-temperature 
shift factors aT obtained from a series of complex modulus tests as 
described earlier. The test results for all strain histories of the three 
temperatures are combined into a single strain history on a reduced 
time scale for the TRZ gradation as shown in Fig. 9(a). For 
comparison, the average accumulated strain of these three 
temperatures versus reduced time for both BRZ and TRZ gradations 
were collected together as shown in Fig. 9(b). The results show that 
a more reduced time is required to reach the same strain of 4% for 
the BRZ gradations. It indicates that the BRZ gradations exhibited 
better resistance against rutting. The results are consistent with the 
previous findings that the BRZ gradations with higher dynamic

strain conducted in the repeated loading triaxial tests, and the 
slightly higher value of ψ determined in the triaxial shear tests, all 
illustrate their superior performance against rutting. This study was 
undertaken to evaluate the mechanical characterization of the 
gradations passing through and below the restricted zone, with the 
FAA value of 45 barely meeting the minimum requirement for the 
condition of heavy traffic. More researches are needed to investigate 
the aggregates with varying values of FAA on the performance of 
the mixtures.

在 Superpave 設計當中，級配的選用上增加了控制點(control points)，以及限制區
(restricted zone)。控制點是級配必須通過:它們放置於最大標稱粒徑、中間篩號(2.36 
mm)、及最小篩號(0.075 mm)處。至於限制區是沿最大密度級配線上設置於中間篩號(2.36 
mm)及(0.3 mm)篩號間。此樣的設計是避免有駝背級配(humped gradation)有過多砂量或
砂中間較多的細砂量，而引起夯實問題及降低抵抗車轍的性能。不過亦有學者 Roberts et
