ash. Hydroxyapatite [Ca5(PO4)6(OH)2] was reacted with aqueous Pb, by dissolution of
Hydroxyapatite and precipitation of hydroxypyromorphite [Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2] [5-6]. By
forming pyromorphite, the bioavailability of the ingested soil Pb is expected to be reduced to
the low solubility of the pyromorphite [Pb5(PO4)3(Cl,F,OH…)] mineral. [5].  Although 
stabilization of wastes is an approved technology, little is actually know about the
mechanisms of leaching from the stabilized waste. A better understanding of leaching
behavior would enable us to predict how to disposal the waste. However, little research has
been reported to identifying the speciation of elements in the residue for leaching behavior.
The TCLP method is generally used in regulation of threshold concentrations of
leachable metals in environmental solids for a landfill processing [6-9]. However, the
toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) data can only provide the level of
pollutant concentrations with little chemical structure information. Nevertheless, it is not
clear what specific reactions take place during the chemical extraction of the operationally
defined phase. Commonly employed in situ speciation methods (e.g., EDX, XPS) can
potentially avoid such limitations, but these methods have often not been sensitive enough to
detect the fine structure of toxic elements. Moreover, the analysis must be conducted under
conditions that may alter chemical species distributions or modify the sample, thus
appending other potential artifacts and confuse data interpretation [10].
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can be used in characterization of the valency
and local structure (< 10 Å) of elements in a complex solid matrix [11]. Extended X-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy can provide structural information including
the coordination number, bond distance, and oxidation state [12-15]. The EXAFS, in fact,
offers a chemical structure of toxic elements in a complex matrix that also facilitate the
development of an effective method for disposal of hazardous wastes [16,17]. By XAS, we
found that copper oxide clusters involved in the catalytic decomposition of NO [18] and
oxidation of chlorophenols in supercritical water [19]. Note that copper oxides may also
catalyze the formation of PCDD/DFS in incineration processes [20].
Thus the main objective of this work was to investigate the chemical structure of
copper in leaching stabilized fly ash by XAS. In addition, discussing the relationship
between copper leaching and coordination number, bond distance by EXAFS.
2 EXPERIMENTAL
Values in Table 1 are the result of TCLP with copper in the stabilization. It seems that
leachable copper concentrations decreased significantly (from 0.469 to 0.112) after
phosphate stabilization. It is well know that pH value effects the leaching of metals
concentration. Table 2 shows that different pH value including initial, after add 3.5 ml
HCl, TCLP 8 hr, TCLP 18 hr. Stabilization 3 has the high acidity due to add more
phosphate acid. After adding 3.5 ml HCl stabilization 1 increased small pH value, it due to
the bad alkaline capacity than the other two stabilizations. However, the stabilization 2,
and 3 increase a little pH value, it may be due to the alkaline material solubility after adding
3.5 ml HCl. After TCLP 8hr, The pH value slow down by acetic acid extracted. But the
pH value a little decrease, it provide the good alkaline buffer capacity.
The XRD patterns of fly ashes are shown in Figure 1. CuO.3H2O and a small
amount of metallic Cu (Cu(0)) and Cu2O were observed in the fly ash. After extracted that
Cu and Cu2O were decreased significantly. In comparison to the unleached fly ash many
of the soluble minerals were dissolved, so the peak height of insoluble minerals was high
significantly. After stabilization and acid extracted, the formation product not including
Cu(OH)2. However, it is clear to find the low solubility product Cu3(PO4)2
(LogKsp=-36.85) and Pb3(PO4)2 (LogKsp=-44.3--4.60) existed. That is the reason that
lead to the decreasing of copper leaching after fly ash solidification. In order to further
understand the chemical structures of the stabilized fly ashes, X-ray absorption spectra of
the fly ashes were measured.
Figure 2 are the XANES spectra of the in the extracted stabilization fly ashes.
The pre-edge XANES spectra of the fly ash sample exhibits a very week 1s→3d transition
(8975-8980 eV) which is forbidden by the selection rule in the case of perfect octahedral
symmetry. A shoulder at 8984-8988 eV and an intense band at 8995-9002 eV were
attributed to the 1s→4p transition that indicates the Cu(II) is existed. The pre-edge band at
8981-8984 eV that is due to the dipole-allowed 1s→4p transtion of Cu(I), was found in the
fly ashes. Cu(II) and a small amount Cu(0), Cu(I) were observed in the fly ash. However,
the stabilization 1 was still found Cu(I), stabilization 2,3 there were only Cu(II) existed.
To some extent, metallic copper is easy to leaching out due to its low solubility product in
acetic acid. Stabilization 3 formation Cu3(PO4)2 due to the ionic copper ion (including
Cu(0), Cu(I), leading to the more low TCLP value. Stabilization 3 has the more phosphatic
acid and Ca(OH)2. At first, addition phosphate and ionic Cu2+ ion, then with phosphate
