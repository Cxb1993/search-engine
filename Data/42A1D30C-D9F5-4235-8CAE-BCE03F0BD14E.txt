本計劃分成研究分成三個階段，第一階段先討論多變數控制的策略，一般認為多變數控制
(MVC)系統較多環路控制(MLC)系統涵蓋為廣。這是因為一般認為多變數控制系統具有去偶合
的能力，能使控制性能變得較好。然而，事實上並非如此。如果控制系統是針對去除負荷而設，
則 MLC 有可能會勝於 MVC。因此在這種情況下，選擇適用的控制結構變得很重要。本研究提
出一個評估選擇的辦法。作法上，先針對某一個 MIMO 程序演導出兩種系統所能產出的最佳
性能。依此性能制定評估的指標作為選擇的依據。 
第二階段主要是設計一個開環控制策略，第一型的糖尿病患者控制血糖必須仰賴於每天地注
射胰島素。對於這類型的病人來說，利用注射胰島素的治療方法去維持病人體內的血糖濃度在
一個可接受的範圍內是相當重要的。此外如果有一個適合的體內血糖數學模型來模擬出真實的
病人體內的血糖系統，這樣的模型就可以促進此類型患者的血糖控制。本研究針對於第一型糖
尿病患者之建立血糖模型以及血糖的開環控制是採用修改過後的 Hovorka 模型 (Hovorka et al., 
2002; Hovorka et al., 2004; Wilinska et al., 2005) 。而臨床上的數據則來自於連續性的血糖偵測系
統(CGMS)，這些數據套用在本研究採用的模型上後，可以用來檢驗血糖模型以及血糖開環控制
的可行性。因此本研究提出一種第一型糖尿病患者的血糖開環控制策略，這個策略是利用胰島
素幫浦來注射適當的胰島素基礎量以及餐前追加量於病人的皮下組織以達到血糖控制的目的。 
第三階段主要是開發和驗證一個類神經網絡（ANN）模型，此模型用以預測第一型糖尿病患
者的葡萄糖濃度以及模仿葡萄糖與胰島素的調節系統，而數據的來源是收集病患使用連續血糖
監測系統（CGMS）的數據。該網絡的結構根據 Hovorka - Wilinska 模型（HWM）和一個自主

ABSTRACT 
A decoupling multivariable controller (abbr. DMVC) is generally considered more general than a 
multi-loop controller (abbr. MLC). This is because DMVC can eliminate the interactions in an MIMO 
process and result in better performance. Nevertheless, MLC may perform better than the DMVC 
while dealing with disturbance rejection. If the control objective is aimed at disturbance rejection, 
selection between these two types of controller for better control is thus necessary. In this paper, a 
method to assess the performances of these two types of controller for a given process is proposed. 
Given an MIMO transfer function model, the achievable performance is derived; indices for assessing 
these two systems are proposed. By making use of these indices, a proper type of system (DMVC or 
MLC) can be selected in the precedence of designing the controller. 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus must rely on daily insulin injection/infusion for the control of blood 
glucose. The treatments on those patients to maintain their blood glucose within an acceptable level is 
thus of essential importance. A good mathematical model of blood glucose may facilitate such a 
control.  In this research, modeling and open-loop control of blood glucose for a type-1 patient using 
a model extended from the works of Hovorka and his coworkers (Hovorka et al., 2002; Hovorka et al., 
2004; Wilinska et al., 2005) are studied.  Clinical data from a continuous glucose monitoring system 
is used to develop the model for such use. Open-loop control strategies for patients that use basal and 
bolus subcutaneous infusions via an insulin pump are presented. 
1 Introduction 
The multi-loop controllers (abbr. MLC) and decoupling multivariable controllers (abbr. DMVC) 
have been used in the control of MIMO chemical plants. The MLC has a diagonal structure with PID 
controllers on the diagonal entries. On the other hand, the DMVC has a full matrix structure. Due to 
the structural difference, it is usually considered that DMVC is superior to the MLC in control. But, 
this is not quite true. In a paper of Niederlinski (1971), an MLC was illustrated to have better load 
rejection ability than a DMVC does. In general, the DMVC is aimed to inverse the transfer function 
matrix (abbr. TFM) of the process, so that the loop transfer function (abbr. LTF) becomes diagonal or 
diagonal dominant. In other words, most multivariable controllers embed, implicitly or explicitly, the 
inverse of   in their designs. Due to this requirement for   inversion, DMVC may not perform 
better than MLC. In contrast, the MLC may suffer from the interactions in a multi-input-multi-output 
(abbr. MIMO) process, which may degrade the performance seriously. In many occasions, depending 
on the process TFM, the DMVC has no absolute advantage over the MLC in performance, especially, 
in dealing with disturbance rejection. In order to achieve better control performance, guidance for the 
selection of control structure prior to the design of controller will be helpful.  
For the selection of controller structure, theoretically achievable performances of these two types of 
controllers in MIMO control systems are required. In fact, the issue of theoretically achievable 
performance has been extensively studied. Papers in literature and books (Harris et al., 1996; Harris et 
al., 1999; Huang et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999) are available. In the past, the minimum variance was 
benchmarked as the optimal achievable performance index. Although theoretically best, this 
benchmarked performance is not practical because the performance that a practical system can 
The motivation of this paper is to show, by making uses of a modification to the Harvoka’s model 
(Hovorka et al., 2002; Hovorka et al., 2004; Wilinska et al., 2005) and real CGMS data, an open-loop 
control that aims to desired HAb1c and blood glucose levels for type 1 patients can be developed. 
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic diseases and is characterized by an 
incapability to control blood glucose concentration in the body. There are two basic types of diabetes 
mellitus: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by failure of the pancreas to 
secrete insulin due to the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islet β-cells. Therefore, patients 
with T1DM must rely on daily insulin injections/infusions for the regulation of blood glucose, i.e., 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Those daily injections/infusions, insulin therapies, 
artificially mimic the endogenous insulin secretion in normal human bodies to maintain their blood 
glucose (BG) levels within an acceptable range. This mimicking can be attained to a certain degree by 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with an insulin pump, which provides a continuous 
basal insulin infusion rate and prandial insulin boluses. However, based on infrequent subcutaneous 
BG measurements, the administration of such insulin infusions to prevent hyperglycemia and 
hypoglycemia and to maintain BG at an acceptable level is still a challenge, especially when the 
patient has irregular diet or activities. The CGMS is a recently commercialized device which can 
provide maximal information about BG levels throughout a long period of time and can help 
physicians to make optimal therapy recommendations for patients with T1DM. 
For the improvement of insulin therapies, currently, a number of model-based glucose-insulin 
regulation systems have been developed that can be used to analyze past therapies, to predict future 
BG levels and to give therapy recommendations. So far, those systems are either based on 
physiological or empirical models. One of the pioneering papers in this field is that of Bolie
1
, and the 
maximal information. In this work, we propose a prediction model with a structured neural network, 
and this model was identified and validated by the CGMS data from patients with T1DM who have 
regular meals and insulin dosages. Furthermore, an additional update scheme is also embedded in our 
model so that the multi-steps ahead prediction can be updated whenever new measurements are 
available. 
Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most important multivariable advance control 
technique implemented in process industries. In general, MPC promises several advantages: (1) Its 
algorithm provides a systematic way to the treatments of constrains; (2) accurate predictions can early 
deal with potential problems; (3) the measurable disturbances can be compensated by feedforward 
control in a natural way. However, for any model-based approach (e.g. MPC), the accurate process 
model call those advantages into existence. In this work, we demonstrate the preliminary experiment 
for tuning MPC and assume that the physiological model we used is a perfect model. To design the 
experimental procedures, we simply take this physiological model as the in silico patient (virtual 
patients). Although the computational load of MPC is somehow more complex than classic control 
algorithm, for example, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, we chose MPC to deal with 
this glycemia control problem because of it is well known that the glycemia regulation system contain 
nonlinearity, time-varying parameters, and delays. This control results show in the preliminary 
closed-loop control experiment section.

The controllers may then be synthesized by using either of the following methods: 
Detuning methods (Luyben, 1986; Monica et al., 1988) 
Sequential loop closing methods (Mayne, 1992; Chiu and Arkun, 1992; Hovd and Skogestad, 1994; 
Shiu and Hwang, 1998) 
Iterative or trial-and-error methods (Shen and Yu, 1994; Lee et al., 1998)  
Simultaneous equation solving or optimization methods (Wang et al., 1998; Bao et al., 1999)  
Independent methods (Economou and Morari, 1986; Grosdidier and Morari, 1986; Skogestad and 
Morari, 1989; Hovd and Skogestad, 1993)  
Providing controllers in all other loops, the transfer functions iq  and ,L ig  can be found and the 
performance of each loop can be evaluated. Since these two transfer functions in (5) and (6) depend 
on all controllers in other loops, the designs of controllers are usually coupled and are conducted in an 
iterative manner. 
A DMVC, denoted as ( )K s  consists of a decoupler ( )D s  and a filter matrix ( )C s . As the design 
in Huang and Lin 
8
, it is possible to find a decoupled process ( )Q s , as shown in Figure 1(b) for a 
By making use of the above-mentioned methods to design the MLC and DMVC, the performances 
of the controllers will be compared, using example processes in the following:

The performances of the systems have been tested for disturbance rejection along different 
directions in the ,1 ,2 vs. L Lk k  plane. For each pair of ,1Lk  and ,2Lk , the optimal performances in 
terms of ISE values of MLC and DMVC can be found and compared. As shown in Figure 2, the 
,1 ,2 vs. L Lk k  plane can be divided into four areas, where the dark areas mean that MLC has a smaller 
ISE than DMVC does. For example, when ,1 5Lk   and ,2 4Lk  , the responses and ISE obtained 
from these two control systems are given in Figure 3.  
In contrast, reverse the sign of ,2Lk , that is ,2 4Lk   , Then, the point ( ,1Lk , ,2Lk ) lies in the gray 
area of Figure 2. As shown by the simulated responses in Figure 4, the performances of DMVC are 
better than those of the MLC, even though the open-loop processes in the two cases are the same. 
From these results, it is found the DMVC is not always superior to the MLC (e.g. the dark zone in 
Figure 2).

Similarly, in MLC systems, a multivariable system can be decomposed into several equivalent 
single-loop systems as shown in (5) and (6). In theory, to formulate , ( )L ig s  requires the controllers 
in all other loops. However, a method to circumvent this difficulty was given by Huang et al. (2003). 
In other words, ( )iq s  and , ( )L ig s  can be given as:

denotes an approximation of ( )jh s , which is specified to achieve reasonable control performance. 
The notation   means element-to-element product of two vectors. 
So, the performances of disturbance rejection for MLC and DMVC systems are given by the 
following transfer functions:

In other words, each of the system has its complementary sensitivity function, , ( )iw s , i.e. 
,MLC ( )iw s or ,MVC ( )iw s , defined for the equivalent SISO loops. In practical design, usually, , ( )iw s  
needs to be confined to some simpler forms so that the performance can be specified clearly; and, the 
resulting controllers can be synthesized with reasonable costs. The optimal performance achievable 
under these restrictions is considered as the practically achievable performance. For this reason, the

and

where ,f i  is the filter time constant, and, has a default values as ,0.05 a i  in MLC and ,0.05 a i  
in DMVC. Furthermore, m  is selected to make ,C ig  proper. 
Based on the closed-loop transfer function of disturbance rejection as shown in (16) and (17), the 
achievable performance of an MLC system depends on the load transfer function of (15) and the 
apparent dead times in the equivalent open-loop transfer function, ( )iq s . Similarly, the performance 
of an DMVC system depends on the original ( )LG s  in (1) and the apparent dead times in the 
decoupled open-loop process, ( )iq s . These apparent dead times in both control systems are required 
to assign , ( )iw s  in (18), and their values are introduced in the following remarks. 
 
where 1{ , , }n   diag   and i  is the dead time of the element in ( )oG s .  Notice that the 
determinant of ( )G s  (i.e. ( )G s ) contains at least one term which is free of dead time. 
With the factorization in (25), the extra dead time is taken as:

this RDG to a generalized disturbance gain (GRDG) for the same purpose was given by Chang and 
Yu (1992). Although applicable to the DMVC systems, this GRDG emphasizes differentiating if the 
interactions favor the change of controller output, but not on the performance.  
Theoretically, errors caused by the disturbances can only be eliminated after a dead time period. 
During this period, the error magnitude in the output is proportional to the load gain of the system. 
Consequently, similar to the above-mentioned RDG, a relative load gain (RLG) is thus defined as 
follows.

2.1.2.2 Assess by dynamic TFM 
In the previous section, the indices for assessing the two control structures are based on an 
assumption that only steady-state gains are available. A more reliable index is to use information not 
only from steady state but also from its dynamics.  
For MLC Systems 
To estimate the control performance for MLC systems, (16) is used. The approximate equivalent 
disturbance transfer function is given in (15) where each element in the matrix ( )ˆ iH  is given by (19) 
or (20) whose parameters have been optimized with respect to ( )iig s  and , ( )L ig s . The estimation of 
optimal performance in MLC systems is to minimize the following 2-norm error by adjusting the 
parameters in ,MLCiw .

Here, f  is the frequency bandwidth of concern. The value of f  has to be selected large 
enough beyond the bandwidth of transfer function iq . In this work, f  is taken as 10 times the 
bandwidth or greater. 
For DMVC Systems 
The responses of disturbance rejection in DMVC systems can be treated as the responses in single 
loop systems as given in (17) where ,MVC ( )iw s  is the complementary sensitivity function for each 
decoupled system. The 2-norm error for practical disturbance rejection of DMVC systems can be 
obtained by minimizing the following with ,MVCiw .

First, steady-state gains are used to compute the assessing indices for the nominal case. From (34), 
the RLGs calculated are: 1 0.26    and 2 0.6  . From (36), it gives 1( ) 0.26K   and 
2 ( ) 0.6K  .  
To take into account the dynamics, the indices will be computed under 1 2 1.6Ms Ms  . First, in 
MLC systems, ˆih  used in (15) are found as following:

So, the equivalent disturbances can be found by (15). According to (24), the apparent dead times 
can be determined as ,1 1a   and ,2 3a  . Then, the 2-norm error for disturbance input are found by 
minimizing (37). Secondly, in DMVC systems, the apparent dead times in both loops are determined 
by (28) as 1 and 3, respectively. Similarly, the 2-norm error for disturbance input in DMVC systems 
are found by minimizing (38). Finally, the assessing indices in (39) can be obtained as 1( ) 0.557G   
and 2 ( ) 1.08G   for the nominal case. Notice that the indices based on steady-state gains are not 
consistent to those based on dynamics.

can avoid model overfitting.  In addition, the compensation RNN (Recurrent Neural 
Network) to take care of the discrepancy between the HWM data and the CGMS data 
from the real patient is constructed and embedded in our model. In the following, we 
will briefly demonstrate the identification of the HWM and the model with structured 
RNN are briefly introduced. 
2.3 The identification of the HWM 
The detailed equations of the HWM are given in Appendix A. In this model, totally, 
there are fourteen parameters which must be determined for each specific patient.

Firstly, we assumed that the insulin dosages and the content of each meal provided 
from a diary and the BG data collected by the CGMS are accurate during an 
experimental period. Using only those first two days of the data, the parameters of the 
HWM are then identified to fit the data by minimizing the following objective 
function.

2.4 Open-loop control via subcutaneous insulin infusion 
Using an artificial pancreas, subcutaneous infusion of insulin according to a 
pre-programmed basal and bolus dosages is one approach to control the blood glucose 
of a type-1 diabetic patient in an open-loop manner. However, artificial pancreas is 
somewhat an expensive device that most of the patients may not afford. Fortunately, 
due to the availability of effective long acting insulin, the pre-programmed 
subcutaneous insulin injection can also be applied to patients who do not use artificial 
pancreas. The multiple subcutaneous injections with long acting and short acting 
insulin can be used to mimic the insulin secretions in a normal body.  The basal 
insulin rate is aimed to maintain a given fasting level of blood glucose (e.g. 100 
mg/dl). The bolus insulin dose is taken to enhance the control of blood glucose at each 
CHO intake.   
2.4.1 Development of bolus dosage plan for Prandial CHO-uptake 
While planning the bolus dosage under a prandial condition, some constraints 
should be considered. These constraints come from clinical demands for normal 
control of blood glucose.  For example,  
(1). Fasting blood glucose   100 mg/dl ( 5.6 mmol/l) 
(2). Two-hour Post-prandial blood glucose   120 mg/dl  
 42 
latter is used to mimic the secretion of the basal insulin in a normal human body. 
Mathematically, basal insulin can be considered as a step dose lasting for 24 hours a 
day that leads G  to a fasting level. In fact, this value can be obtained by solving the 
set of algebraic equations obtained from setting the derivatives in the extended 
Hovorka model to zeros.  The fasting glucose to mimic the effect of the secretion of 
basal insulin in a normal human body is taken as 100 mg/dl in this study (γ0=100 
mg/dl).  A lower value may also be taken, however, a too low value may lead (62) 
without having feasible solution.  Based upon this basal insulin amount (or, in other 
words, the targeting blood glucose) the bolus dosage plan will then be computed.   
Next, we need to develop the function, ( )bo iu x , which describes the required bolus 
dosage to a CHO intake from meals.  The parameters *
1*,and    are considered for 
type-1 diabetic patients to have an acceptable glycated hemoglobin (i.e., hemoglobin 
HbA1c or, simply, A1c) value. The use of hemoglobin A1c for monitoring the degree 
of control of glucose metabolism in diabetic patients was proposed in 1976 by Koenig 
and coworkers.  A buildup of A1c within the red cell reflects the average level of 
glucose to which the cell has been exposed during its life cycle (approx. 120 days). 
Thus, the A1c level is proportional to the averaged blood glucose concentration over 
the previous four weeks to three months. According to ADA (American Diabetes 
 44 
For easier application, one may consider to replace the (24 )avG hrs  with the 
following:


    (68) 
Where, 1x , 2x , 3x  are CHO amounts in terms of grams taken from the daily three 
meals. (67) compute the mean BG by assuming that daily BG has a level at (6 )avG hrs  
in a period of three meals (i.e.18 hours) and at 100mg/dl in the fasting period (i.e. 
another 6 hrs).  Thus, specifying *1  in (65) is to specify the target A1c as shown in 
Figure 4. An effective control of blood glucose should make this A1c value to remain 
below 7.  In practical treatment, the values of *
1*,and    may differ from subject to 
subject. If a bolus-to-CHO relation is available, then, given a daily CHO-plan, the 
average blood glucose can be computed from integrating the model.  A graphical 
approach to the solution of a bolus-to-CHO relation will be demonstrated in the 
example that follows. 
2.4.2 Preliminary case study 
As mentioned, the basal insulin amount versus the fasting blood glucose levels can 
be calculated from the steady-state solution to the modified Hovorka model given in 
 46 
under a give basal insulin amount, the bolus dosage required for each CHO-intake can 
be read from these curves. If, a CHO meal-plan is taken (e.g., breakfast: 30gm, lunch: 
60gm, dinner:60gm) with the bolus dosage plan as shown in Fig. 15 (e.g. breakfast: 
1.05U, lunch: 2.1U, dinner: 2.1U), the averaged blood glucose could be expected to  
be 113.5 which gives 5.76 for the A1c value.  Compared to the current record from 
the CGMS, the A1c value as well as the blood glucose could be significantly 
improved.

2.5 Prediction model with structured RNN 
Based on the HWM, these identified parameters generate data for neural network 
training. A prediction model with structured RNN was developed based on the 
structure of this compartmental physiological HWM. A block diagram of our 
proposed SRNNM is shown in Figure 13. The two inputs in this model are meal 
(u1={DG, tmax,G}) and insulin (u2={ubasal, ubolus}). As can be seen, the sub-RNN for q3 
was constructed to mimic the dynamic response of q3 from (88) - (91) in Appendix A. 
Similarly, sub-RNNs for x1, x2, and x3 were constructed to describe the dynamic 
behavior from (85), (86), and (87), respectively in Appendix A. Then, RNN for Q1 & 
Q2 was constructed for (79) and (80) in Appendix A. After that, an additional

2.5.1 New available measurements update scheme 
In addition, we designed an update scheme to improve the performance of 
prediction whenever new measurements are available. As shown in Figure 13, when 
the blood glucose was reported by a new infrequent measurement (i.e., *G (t) ), the 
difference between *G (t) and Gˆ(t) was weighted, then added to Gˆ(t) to estimate 
Gˆ(t | t) .  
2.6 Long term prediction 
The following prediction horizons were employed in this work (sampling time: 5 
min): 6-step-ahead (30-min-ahead), 24-step-ahead (2-hr-ahead), and 48-step-ahead 
(4-hr-ahead). Firstly, the uncorrected prediction of BG (i.e., ˆ ( | 1)G t t  ) was obtained 
from implementing the SRNNM shown in Figure 13. By recursive use of this model, 
the prediction of BG can be computed out to an extended time in the future, i.e., 
ˆ ( | 1); 1,2, ,G t i t i N    . 
The predictive BG can be refreshed whenever a new measurement of BG is 
available to use in the following update scheme: 
 *ˆ ˆ ˆ( | ) ( | 1) [ ( ) ( | 1)]G t t G t t w G t G t t      (70) 
The appropriate proportional weight w  can be obtained by optimizing the 
following objective function:

3.2 Structured RNN model simulation 
In this work, the SRNNM was simulated using the Matlab neural network toolbox. 
For each sub-RNN in this model, we employed the feed-forward back-propagation 
network with one hidden layer. The data set which contained three day worth of 
measurements was divided into two parts. The first part consisting of two days of the 
data set was used to identify and train the networks (i.e., training set), and the other 
part called validation set contained one day of the data set. In addition, the 
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM) was used to optimize the mean square error 
(MSE), that is, the quantitative measure of the performance.  This LM optimization

4 Preliminary Closed-loop Control In Silico Experiment  
4.1 Model predictive control  
A more detailed overview of MPC can be found in textbook, and brief introduction 
of the basic MPC algorithm is shown below. The MPC algorithm include: prediction 
model, objective function, and receding horizon optimization. In this work, we simply 
take the HWM as the in silico patient (virtual patients), and we conducted the 
experiment to tuning MPC. This experiment can be simply designed by making an 
assumption which the prediction model is a perfect model (i.e. HWM). The objective 
function is given as

where the integers Ny and Nu (Ny > Nu) are refer to as the prediction horizon and 
control horizon, respectively. The set-point for MPC is yr, and the prediction model 
outputs ˆ( | )y t j t  mean that the multi-step prediction based on the past and the 
current information. The control signals over time (u) are computed in the control

After a feasible solution is obtained, only the first control signal is implemented to 
update the real control signal. In this work, this optimization problem is solved used 
the constrained nonlinear programming solver in MATLAB, and the 
trust-region-reflective optimization algorithm is chosen in this solver. 
4.3 In silico experiment results 
4.3.1 Tuning MPC 
Firstly, because the glucose-insulin regulation dynamics are relatively slow, the 
prediction horizon is chosen as 48 (i.e. 4-hours-ahead) to guarantee that the forecasted 
outputs are rich enough. Secondly, the control horizon is chosen as 6 (i.e. 
30-minutes-ahead) to lighten the computational load and consider the system 
dynamics. Thirdly, there are two weights, including weight on the outputs ( ) and 
weight on the rate of change (  ) needed to designed. Therefore, we conducted the 
experiments under two different pairs of weights: { , } {1,1}    and { , } {1,0}   . 
 62 
penalty. In the Figure 20 and 21, hypoglycemia, which is the worst situation for 
glycemia control, appear several times so that the fixed set point MPC is not a good 
choice for this control problem. The results shown in the Figure 18 indicate that the 
BG profile is within the safe range (70~180 mg/dL) but not the optimal one. To 
compare the results shown in the Figure 19, this BG profile is obviously better than 
previous one shown in the Figure 18. Furthermore, to facilitate comparing the control 
performance, Table 4 summarizes the quantification of the control performance for 
each controller design. To compare the control performance under 
region-penalty-MPC with different weighting pairs, the MAGE value under the 
weighting pair{ , } {1,0}    is 49 mg/dL lower than the value under the weighting 
pair{ , } {1,1}   . Those results indicate that the weight on the rate of change (  ) is 
not necessary for this control problem.  The value of MAGE is the arithmetic mean 
of the glycemia excursions of two successive twenty-four-hour periods. The reason of 
this index selection is that our interest lay in the amplitude of the blood glucose 
swings and not in the dispersion of all the blood glucose values.

5 Discussion and Conclusions 
Multi-loop and decoupling multivariable controllers are commonly used in the 
control of MIMO processes. Prior to the design of controller, selecting a proper type 
of controller is an important issue. For this purposes, methods to assess the 
performance between two types of systems are proposed. These methods are derived 
 68 
human body and control the blood glucose to an acceptable level.  The basal amount 
is to be determined to maintain the fasting glucose value at a given level. The bolus 
dosage is then determined based upon this basal insulin and the CHO intake in each 
meal. The bolus is aimed to keep the blood glucose within upper and lower bounds. 
The lower bound is 70 mg/dl which is normally considered in medical treatment to 
prevent the occurrence of hypoglycermia. The upper bound can be considered on a 
person-to-person basis. Besides setting the glucose value in the upper/lower bounds, 
the bolus dosage plan is also aimed to have a targeted A1c value, which is normally 
less than 7.0 in general medical treatments for the diabetes patients. The basal insulin 
amount and the bolus dosage plan are demonstrated with the utilization of the 
developed models. 
The results derived from this investigation indicate that prediction of BG levels for 
patients with T1DM is possible. To compare with two relevant research papers, firstly, 
the paper by Bellazzi et al. (1995) is focused on implementation of a mathematical 
model for the simulation of a patient with T1DM, identification using neural networks, 
and performing simulation studies with closed-loop control. By contrast, we try to 
clarify and solve the problems for a real patient with T1DM. Secondly, Mougiakakou 
et al. (2005) developed a simulation model but validated by the data from invasive 
finger lacing test instead of the CGMS data which can provide maximal information
