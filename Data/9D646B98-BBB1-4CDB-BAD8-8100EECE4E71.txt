Abstract
Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 
scale has been widely used in studying various 
tasks and physical activities. In addition to the 
RPE scale, Borg’s category rating 10 (CR-10) 
scale has also been constructed for a similar 
purpose. The objectives of this project were to 
determine whether calibration of the CR-10 is 
required for hand exertion and how to calibrate 
the rating if a calibration is needed. In addition, 
the difference in reporting the CR-10 scores 
between the two genders was also discussed. 
Two experiments were performed. The first one 
will tested the power grip forces for both the 
dominant and non-dominate hands under two 
arm postures. Regression analyses were 
performed for the grip force and the CR-10
scores. The second experiment was performed to 
test the pinch grip forces for the two hands 
under five postures. The pinch was conducted 
using the thumb and the lateral of the index 
finger. Regression analyses were performed for 
the grip force and the CR-10 scores. The results 
of this study were helpful in interpreting the 
perceived exertion when using the CR-10 scale 
in both power and pinch grip.

Introduction
The study of perceived effort has long been 
dominated by Borg’s concept of perceived 
exertion (Borg, 1982; 1990). Borg’s ratings of 
perceived exertion (RPE) scale have been 
4The objectives of this project were to test 
the hypotheses that the perceived exertions of 
hand grip of dominant hand and non-dominant 
hand are different and perceived hand exertions 
dependent on the postures.
Methods
This study was conducted in the laboratory.
Subjects
Twenty male college students were 
recruited as human subjects. All the subjects 
were free from musculoskeletal injuries. Their 
age, stature, and body weight were 22.1 (±2.5) 
yrs, 172.3 (±5.3) cm, and 69.8 (±12.5) kg, 
respectively. All the subjects received payment 
and had signed informed consent for their 
participation in the study. All the subjects, 
except one, were right-handlers. They were 
requested to refrain from physical activities at 
least one hour before joined the experiment.
Apparatus
A TAKEI
®
5001 hand dynamometer was
used to measure the grip force of the hand. The 
dynamometer was calibrated by the supplier 
before the experiment. A commercially available 
handgrip to build up hand/arm muscles was also 
adopted. A Borg CR-10 scale (Borg, 1982) was 
used for subjective rating.
Hand/posture conditions
The hand exertions were measured under 
two hand conditions and two posture conditions. 
The measurements were conducted using either 
dominant hand or non-dominant hand. The hand 
postures included 90q and 180q at the elbow.
Grip force measurement 
Before the study, the subjects were verbally 
instructed the nature and use of the CR-10 scales. 
The grip-to-scale calibrating procedure proposed 
by Spielholz (2006) was adopted. In this 
procedure, each subject was required to exert 
hand forces corresponding to different CR-10
scale levels. Four levels on the CR-10 scale 
were tested: 2 (weak), 5 (strong), 7 (very strong) 
and 10 (extremely strong). Each subject was
requested to grip the dynamometer to one of 
these levels. The grip span of the dynamometer 
was 5 cm. The power grip sustained for four 
seconds and the peak value of the grip force was 
recorded. 
Estimation of CR-10 rating
The handgrip was adopted as a basis to 
examine the CR-10 rating for the subjects under 
different experimental conditions. The subjects 
were requested to apply a 10 kgf force. The grip 
span was approximately 4 cm. He, then, 
reported a CR-10 rating of the hand exertion.
Experiment design & data analysis
The grip force measurement experiment 
was conducted using a three-factor completely 
randomized design. Both the descriptive 
statistical analysis and analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) were performed. 
In addition, linear regression equations
without intercept were built:
CR-10 rating=ȕ×grip force+͍i (1)
where ȕ LV the regression coefficient and͍i is a 
random error.
In the handgrip test, the CR-10 ratings after 
applying a 10 kgf power grip force were also 
collected under a three-factor completely 
randomized design with one trial in each 
treatment. A total of 80 measures were collected. 
6the force at level 10, the grip forces were 
converted into %MVC. The %MVC at levels of 
2, 5, and 7 for dominant hand were 24.7%, 
56.2%, and 75.6%, respectively. The %MVC 
values at the three levels for non-dominant hand 
were 25.6%, 60.5%, and 80.0%, respectively. 
All the %MVC values were higher than their 
corresponding CR-10 levels times 10. This 
implies that the subjects applied a force exertion 
higher than they perceived. Comparing the 
%MVC between the two hands at the 2, 5, and 
levels, non-dominant hands showed higher 
values than those of the dominant hand at all 
three levels.
The interaction effects between the exertion 
level and posture in Fig. 4 showed similar trends 
as in Fig. 3. The grip forces between the two 
postures at low exertion levels such as 2 and 5 
were negligible. At level 10, the grip forces at 
180° posture were higher than those at the 90°.
The %MVC at levels of 2, 5, and 7 for the 90°
posture were 26.1%, 59.2%, and 79.0%, 
respectively. The %MVC values at the three 
levels for the 180° posture were 24.3%, 57.4%, 
and 76.6%, respectively. All the %MVC values 
were higher than their corresponding CR-10
levels times 10. The %MVC values for the 90°
posture were higher than those of the 180°
posture for all the 2, 5, and 7 levels. 
The regression coefficients in Table 1
indicate that the increases of the CR-10 rating
due to an increase of grip force depend on the 
hand used and posture. With each unit (kgf) 
increase in grip force, the CR-10 ratings at the 
90° posture increased 0.24 and 0.23 for 
non-dominant and dominant hands, respectively. 
At the 180° posture, the increases were 0.23 and 
0.21 for non-dominant and dominant hands, 
respectively. A pair-wised t-test results 
comparing the regression coefficients showed 
that the difference between dominant and 
non-dominant hands was statistically significant 
(p<0.001). In Table 1, lower increases in the 
CR-10 rating associated with an increase in grip 
force were also observed for the 180° posture 
than those of the 90° posture. A pair-wised t-test 
results comparing the regression coefficients 
also showed that the difference between the two 
postures was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
The R
2
represents the percentage of 
variation of the dependent variable which could 
be explained by the independent variable. An R
2
of 0.96 or higher indicates that almost all the 
variation of the subjective rating may be 
explained by the grip force. It was shown in 
Table 2 that the estimated CR-10 ratings were 
significantly (p<0.01) lower than those of the 
actual values under all the hand/posture 
conditions. For non-dominant hand, the 
estimation errors for the 90° and 180° postures 
were 1.50 (38.1%) and 1.54 (40.2%), 
respectively. For dominant hand, the estimation 
errors for the two postures were 1.18 (33.7%) 
and 1.08 (33.7%), respectively. The subjects 
reported subjective scores higher than those
estimations based on their own perception and 
grip force data even though the corresponding 
regression models had very high R
2
values.
The results of the current study indicated 
that the CR-10 rating scale has high correlation 
with the power grip force. This was consistent 
with those in the literature (Buchholz et al.,
2008). However, perceived exertions of power 
grip might be affected by both the hand used and 
hand/arm posture. In addition, the subjects had a 
tendency to report the subjective ratings of
power grip exertion higher than the actual 
%MVC values.

I. INTRODUCTION
The study of perceived effort has long been 
dominated by Borg’s concept of perceived exertion 
[1]. Borg’s ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) 
scale (ranged from 6 to 20) have been widely used 
in analyzing various manual tasks as well as in 
many physical works [1] as a supplementary 
measure in addition to physiological measures. In 
addition to the RPE scale, Borg [2] has constructed 
another subjective scale, called CR-10 scale. Borg 
[2] claimed that the advantage of the CR-10 scale 
over the RPE scale is that the former lacks of an 
inter-subjective unit for direct determinations of 
intensity levels while the latter provides direct level 
estimates for determinations of ratio relationships 
between perceptual responses. Both the RPE and 
the CR-10 scales may be used to measure muscular 
exertion and physical workload for whole body or 
specific body segment. 
Even though the Borg’s RPE and CR-10 scales have 
been claimed function well, investigations and 
discussions on the design, function, and requirement 
of calibration are still continued. Buchholz et al. [3]
examined the agreement of subjective ratings of 
upper extremity exposures with corresponding 
direct measurements obtained simultaneously from 
workers. Psychophysical ratings of exposure, based 
on the Borg CR-10 scale, were obtained for the 
period of time in which direct measurements were 
acquired using electro-goniometers, 
electro-inclinometers and electromyography.
Subjects from workers at two automobile 
manufacturing plants were selected. Significant 
relationships between subjective ratings of wrist 
position and measured wrist posture or motion and 
between ratings of shoulder position and measured
shoulder posture were not found. 
In the study of Spielholz [4], twenty subjects 
applied power grip forces corresponding to their 
perceptions of different Borg CR-10 scale levels 
using both ‘‘grip-to-scale’’ and ‘‘guided-grip’’ 
procedures. These data were used separately to 
define relationships between scale ratings and actual 
force application. Two gripping tasks were 
performed and corresponding subjective hand force 
ratings were calibrated using the grip-to-scale 
calibration data. The results showed that the mean 
estimation error for a 44.5 N power grip task was 
significantly reduced from 142.8 to 62.3 N. The 
guided-grip calibration method also significantly 
reduced rating error for the power grip task. 
Spielholz’s [4] study indicated that calibration of 
hand force ratings using the grip-to-scale procedure 
may improve the accuracy of hand exertion
measurements using the Borg CR-10 scale.
Handgrip is a fundamental element in performing 
many tasks. The Borg’s CR-10 has been discussed 
in the literature [1,2,3]. The objective of this study 
were to examine the relationship between the grip 
force of the dominant hand and the Borg’s CR-10
ratings and to report the deviation of predicted grip 
force from measured force based on a linear 
regression model developed in the study.
