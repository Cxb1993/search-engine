一、前言與文獻探討 
本計畫原本預計利用二年的時間，完成五項關鍵微波被動電路之小型化研
究。這五個研究分別是小型化雙頻濾波器、具寬頻之雙頻帶通濾波器、具寬截止
頻帶之寬頻帶通濾波器、縮小型平衡至非平衡轉換器及小型化阻抗轉換器。由於
審查結果僅能執行一年，因此計畫完成項目也略作調整，將後三項設計即具寬截
止頻帶之寬頻帶通濾波器、縮小型平衡至非平衡轉換器及小型化阻抗轉換器優先
進行。 
 
二、研究目的 
本計畫已在一年之中完成三項關鍵微波被動電路之小型化研究。同時爲能達
到低成本目的，這些電路皆採用平面印刷電路板的技術。 
 
三、研究方法 
第一項成果具寬截止頻帶的寬頻帶通濾波器，也是研究微波濾波器非常重要
的主題。圖一的濾波器架構則是能產生此寬截止頻帶與寬頻帶之特性，它是同時
結合了寬頻帶通濾波器與低通濾波器。而圖二則是模擬與量測結果。

    第三項成果是小型化阻抗轉換器。阻抗轉換器常被用作阻抗匹配、功率分配
或結合，以及平衡至非平衡阻抗轉換上。四分之ㄧ波長的阻抗轉換器是最常使用
的阻抗轉換器，但是它的缺點是頻寬小以及尺寸需四分之ㄧ波長的電氣長度而不
夠微小。因此本研究的目的乃是在提出一尺寸微小但仍擁有足夠頻寬的阻抗轉換
器電路，而圖五即是所提出的小型化阻抗轉換器架構。

Fig. 2 displays the relationship between the operating 
bandwidth BW and electrical length θ with given real 
impedance ratio RL/RS. In particular, the operating bandwidth 
in Fig. 2 refers to the frequency range with |S11| smaller than   
-20 dB. Fig. 2(a) shows that with the real impedance ratio 
RL/RS from 2 to 4, the operating bandwidth becomes wider 
when the electrical length increases. On the other hand, Fig. 
2(b) indicates that with the real impedance ratio RL/RS greater 
than 4, the operating bandwidth becomes narrower when the 
electrical length increases. Moreover, with real impedance 
ratio RL/RS from 2 to 4, Fig. 2(a) shows that the operating 
bandwidth becomes wider with greater real impedance ratio 
when the electrical length is small than 64o; the operating 
bandwidth becomes narrower with larger real impedance ratio 
when the electrical length is larger than 64o. On the other hand, 
with the real impedance ratio RL/RS equal to/greater than 4, a 
similar conclusion as Fig. 2(a) can be drawn from Fig. 2(b) 
with 66o as the critical electrical length.

Table I lists dimensions of this impedance transformer with 
broadside coupled line. Fig. 5 shows photographs of the 
fabricated impedance transformer; in addition, the compared 
results of EM simulation and measurement are also shown in 
Fig. 4. It is shown that the measured operating central 
frequency shifts upward a little from 1 to 1.05 GHz; the 
measured operating bandwidth is 7% while the EM simulated 
operating bandwidth is 8%. In brief, these results echo the 
theoretical prediction even with the slight difference.

IV. CONCLUSION 
The impedance transformer with broadside coupled line has 
been developed and fabricated. The coupled line, whose 
electrical length is smaller than a quarter wavelength, is 
employed for size reduction of the proposed impedance 
transformer. The simulated and measured results demonstrate 
the potential for wideband operation as well. The analytic 
equations for the design of impedance transformer with 
broadside coupled line are applicable to complex impedance 
transformation. Because of the easy design procedure and 
compact size, the impedance transformer with broadside 
coupled line introduced in this paper is suitable to be 
integrated in single-chipped circuits and implemented on 
printed circuit boards.

Where Vth is the threshold voltage and Vsat is the saturated 
voltage level. The limiting amplifier stage successively 
performs the limiting action in response to the input signal 
(Vin) before it reaches the final output port (VLIM OUT). The 
output (Vo) from each limiting amplifier stage substantially 
couples to a full-wave rectifier for providing an output current 
signal of which logarithmically varies as a function of the 
input signal. In a successive detection logarithmic amplifier, 
the limiting amplifier plays a major role on the applicable 
frequency range.  
The bandwidth of the rectifier need not be as high as that of the 
limiting amplifier. If the rectifier gain rolls off with frequency, 
the output current from the rectifier will decrease, but the 
dynamic range of the log-amp is unchanged. This paper 
proposes a wideband linear-in-decibel RF power detector by 
properly employing a Cherry-Hooper topology [7] as the 
limiting amplifier and two unbalanced source-coupled pairs 
[8] as the full-wave rectifier. In general, the limiting amplifier 
could be a common-source differential amplifier with a load of 
the PMOS diode, as shown in Fig. 3.  
 
 
The gate of the transistor M3 ties to drain, so does the 
transistor M4. Both of transistors M3 and M4 operate in the 
deep triode region that serves as a resistive load. Transistor M5 
operates in the saturation region and acts as the current source. 
The small-signal gain is dependent on the physical dimensions 
of the transistors. Figure 3 shows the simulated frequency 
response of limiting amplifier with PMOS diode-connected 
Load. It is obvious that this configuration is not applicable to 
the RF power detection above 2GHz. 
 
In order to achieve a linear RF power detection under higher 
frequency (e.g. C-band), this study employs a Cherry-Hooper 
architecture in limiting amplifier stage. The pole of the transfer 
characteristic in such topology is higher due to the existence of 
resistance feedback between drain and gate. The features of 
the Cherry-Hooper amplifier are broadband and suppressed 
gain (as depicted in Fig. 4).  
 
 
For the sake of overwhelming the suppressed gain, a 
modification with source follow feedback (M5, M6) and split 
resistors (Rs1, Rs2) is necessary [9]. This study uses the 
modified Cherry-Hooper topology in the limiting amplifier 
stage as depicted in Fig. 5 to make the RF power detection 
applicable for higher frequency with proper dynamic range. 
 
Owing to the high gain feature of the cascaded limiting 
amplifiers, a DC offset resulted from the non-ideal effects and 
the device mismatch between differential pair will be 
amplified large and result in smearing the real input signal. 
Severely, it will make the output stage saturated and becomes 
incorrect. Therefore, it is necessary to employ an offset 
cancellation circuit to compensate the DC offset. An AC 
coupling method is the simplest one and used in this design. 
The AC coupling capacitors (CC1, CC2) blocks the DC offset 
voltage. The resistor (Rb1, Rb2) is the bias resistor of the next 
stage. Both of coupling capacitors (CC1, CC2) and bias resistor 
(Rb1, Rb2) should be larger enough to minimize the high pass 
cutoff frequency. 
The functionality of rectifier after each limiting stage is to 
rectify the carrier signal to a dc current Iout. A full-wave 
rectifier consists of two identical unbalanced source-coupled 
pairs (M11-M12 and M13-M14) connected in parallel [9]. They 
are cross-coupled on input stages and parallel connected on the 
output stages. Each source-coupled pair includes two 
transistors with different aspect ratio (W/L) in feature size. 
Both of M11 and M13 are N times larger than M12 and M14. 
Most of the current steers to M11 (or M13) in the presence of

IV. CONCLUSION  
In this study, a linear-in-decibel radio-frequency power 
detector of wide bandwidth successfully realized with high 
dynamic range at the same time. Whatever the point of view is 
on dynamic range or logarithmic error, the working range can 
range from DC to 8GHz. The power consumption is less than 
70mW. Usually, it is difficult to have the dynamic range 40dB 
with log error ± 1dB at 8GHz under such low power 
consumption. Vdd supply voltage is 2.8V as it usually used in 
the handset chip set. This study successfully demonstrates a 
wideband linear-in-decibel RF power detector using CMOS 
technology with higher dynamic range and lower power 
consumption.

With the assistance of the proposed structure, the 
transmission line with CSRRs, transmission zeros are 
generated and can be employed to suppress harmonics. 
Moreover, by rotating the angle θ  between two open circles 
in the ground plane and adjusting the width W of 
transmission line shown in Fig. 4, the frequency of the 
transmission zeros generated can be tuned. In particular, the 
wider the width of the transmission line is, the lower the 
frequency of the transmission zeros is.
