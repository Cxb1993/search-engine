cross-sectional bulk mean velocity, of 10000. Results were discussed in terms of streamwise and transverse 
mean velocity component distributions, turbulent kinetic energy distributions, and pressure coefficient 
distributions. The presence of spatial fully developed streamwise mean velocity profile was examined as well. 
The fluid flow results were subsequently used to explain previously published heat transfer trends and 
provide rationale for the differences in the heat transfer enhancements attained. It is found that the near-wall 
transverse mean velocity component is the most critical flow dynamic factor in augmenting the proposed 
turbine blade internal coolant passage.

International Journal of Heat and Mass1. Introduction
Methods of passive heat transfer enhancement (HTE)
have been extensively explored with the attempts to over-
come the thermal problems subject to high heat ﬂuxes. A
variety of surface ribs [1–6], dimples [7–9], pin-ﬁns
[10,11], perforated baﬄes [12], twisted tapes [13–16], wing-
let-type vortex generators [17,18] and the scaled roughness
[19] has been devised to enhance heat transfer rates in
ducts. Mechanisms for heat transfer augmentation vary
with diﬀerent HTE elements [1–19] that generally elevate
ribbed channels include the periodical penetration of pro-
truding ribs across boundary layers, turbulence promotions
and the generation of large scale secondary ﬂows. The cross
stream vortices induced by angled ribs convey the cooler
ﬂuid from the duct core towards the heated surface that
augment heat transfer further by diminishing the thickness
of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. Depending
on the conﬁgurations of rib ﬂoor and channel geometry [1–
6], HTE ratios in ribbed channels vary between 2 and 3.5
times of the Dittus–Boelter references [20]. Thermal perfor-
mances of rib-roughened surfaces are generally impaired byAvailable online 26 July 2007
Abstract
A novel heat transfer enhancement (HTE) roughness with V-shaped ribs and deepened scales is devised. Performances of heat transfer
and pressure drop in a rectangular channel ﬁtted with such HTE surfaces are experimentally examined for both forward and backward
ﬂows in the Re range of 1000–30000. Relative to the smooth-walled pipe ﬂow conditions, HTE ratios for the present test channel with
forward and backward ﬂows, respectively, reach 9.5–13.6 and 9–12.3 for laminar ﬂows and 6.8–6.3 and 5.7–4.3 for turbulent ﬂows. Com-
parisons of heat transfer data, pressure-drop measurements and thermal performance factors with previous results collected from vari-
eties of HTE devices demonstrate the superiorities of this compound HTE device. The decrease of HTE ratio as Re increases for
turbulent ﬂows, which is a common setback for several HTE elements, is almost diminished in the channel ﬁtted with present compound
HTE surfaces. Experimental correlations of heat transfer and friction coeﬃcient for the tested channel with forward and backward ﬂows
are derived for design applications.

f Hebetween the upstream and downstream sides of each VG.
These VG-induced vortices swirl the bulk ﬂow that pro-
mote ﬂuid mixings close to and far from the channel walls
that generates considerable heat transfer augmentations
[17]. But the large cost of pressure loss in VG channel pre-
vents its wide applications and has led to an alternative
approach by ﬁtting VG on one wall with the rib ﬂoor on
the opposite wall [18]. HTE ratios of a VG channel from
the smooth-walled references are in the ranges of 2.9–3.41
for turbulent ﬂows [18]. In view of preserving the structural
stiﬀness and integrity of a coolant channel, the scale-rough-
ened surface is proposed [19]. A large amount of deepened
scales over the roughened wall breaks the boundary layers
and promotes turbulence activities. Localized vortical ﬂow
cells are triggered when the bulk ﬂow traverses each scale
either from the forward or backward direction. Nusselt
number ratios (Nu/Nu1) for laminar forward and back-
ward ﬂows in the scale-roughened channel of H/W = 1/8
were in the range of 7.4–9.2 and 6.2–7.4, respectively. Tur-
bulent heat transfer rates in the scale-roughened narrow
channel were about 4.5 and 3 times of the Dittus–Boelter
levels for the forward and backward ﬂows, respectively
[19].
The on-going search for better heat transfer perfor-
mances is continued by combining diﬀerent HTE elements
into a compound HTE device. The so called compound
enhancement generally oﬀers the higher HTE ratio than
the individual techniques applied separately. Research
goals in this respect involve the further elevations of
HTE ratio and thermal performance factor with the
extended eﬀective Re range. Typical examples of such com-
pound HTE measures for channel ﬂows include the combi-
nation of twisted tape and corrugated tube [21] and the
serrated twisted tape [22]. The corrugated tube with twisted
tape insert could elevate Nusselt numbers to 1.9–9.6 times
of the plain tube value in the Re range of 4000–60,000 [21].
Insertion of rib-roughened twisted tape in a tube with
5000 6 Re 6 25,000 acquires the HTE ratios of 2.5–4.8
times of the plain tube value [22]. Compound techniques
have become the frontier area of enhancement that proves
promise for a variety of practical applications. Following
on our previous work [19] that examined the thermal per-
formances of the scaled roughness, this study was moti-
vated by the need to further elevate HTE ratios for the
coolant passages in a gas turbine blade. Blade cooling
applications require the considerations of structural integ-
rities of HTE devices and the cost and availability of fabri-
cation means. The present experimental study examines the
HTE ratios, pressure drop characteristics and the thermal
performance factors for a novel compound technique that
combines the scaled roughness and V-shaped ribs to form
an eﬀective element of surface roughness. With turbine
blade cooling applications, requirements for structural
integrities of HTE device itself are satisﬁed by the present
compound HTE surface. There is no previous study avail-

ids Laboratory.2. Experimental details
2.1. Apparatus
Fig. 1 depicts the experimental apparatus that shows
the schematics of test assembly (a) and the geometrical
details of compound V-ribs and scale roughness (b). As
shown in Fig. 1a, the IWATA SC-175C screw-type com-
pressor (1) and the refrigerating unit (2) continuously fed
the dehumidiﬁed and cooled airﬂow to the test assembly
at the ambient temperature level. The test airﬂow was then
channeled through a set of pressure regulator and ﬁlter (3)
with the mass ﬂow rate measured and adjusted by the
Bronkhorst mass ﬂow meter (4) and the needle valve (5),
respectively. The pressure transducer (6) with digital dis-
play detected the entry pressure of coolant ﬂow. Prior to
entering the rectangular test section with two opposite
walls roughened by compound V-ribs and scales (7), the
pressurized airﬂow entered a 150 mm  150 mm  80 mm
plenum chamber (8). The cross-sectional area ratio
between the plenum chamber and the test channel was
3.75 that simulated the abrupt entry condition. Dimen-
sions of the test channel were 80 mm  40 mm  220 mm.
Channel aspect ratio (H/W) and hydraulic diameter are
1/2 and 53 mm, respectively. A K-type thermocouple pen-
etrated into the core of plenum chamber adjacent to the
entrance of test channel to measure the coolant entry tem-
perature. This ﬂuid entry temperature was selected to
deﬁne the ﬂuid properties at the ﬂow entrance for the eval-
uation of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers at the ﬂow
entrance. Streamwise increments of ﬂow bulk temperature
(Tb) from one measurement spot to its successive down-
stream location were determined using the sequential
energy balance method. This method determined Tb values
at the axial locations where wall temperatures (Tw) were
detected. At the exit plane of the heated test section, three
type K thermocouples with equal spanwise interval pene-
trated into the core of the converging section (9) to mea-
sure the ﬂuid temperatures. The exit temperature of ﬂuid
was obtained by averaging the three thermocouple mea-
surements. To check for the accuracy of energy conserva-
tion at the stage of data acquisition, the evaluated Tb value
was constantly checked with the measured ﬂuid exit tem-
perature. Data batch was accepted when the diﬀerences
between the measured and calculated Tb values were less
than 8% at the exit plane.
Structural consolidations of V-ribs and scales over each
roughened heat transfer surface are depicted in Fig. 1b.
The V-ribs on two opposite heated walls were arranged
in the staggered manner with the following geometrical def-
initions for the rib conﬁgurations:
Rib angle of attack, aR, = 45;
Rib height, eR (1.77 mm)/channel height, H (40 mm) =
0.04;
at and Mass Transfer 51 (2008) 457–468 459Rib pitch, PR (17.7 mm)/rib height, eR (1.77 mm) = 10;
Rib land, lR (1.77 mm)/rib height, eR (1.77 mm) = 1.
f Heconductivity, the Nu data generated by the present study
represents the average Nusselt number at each axial loca-
tion. As indicated in Fig. 1b, 12 K-type thermocouples with
equal interval were installed on the back face of along the
centerline the roughened surface for wall-temperature mea-
surements. These thermocouple locations for Tw measure-
ments corresponded to the rib and mid-rib locations. All
the temperature measurements were monitored and stored
in a PC using through the data logger for the subsequent
data processing. Wall temperature measurements at all
the axial locations were corrected into the base-line surface
as indicated in Fig. 1b using the one dimensional heat con-
duction equation. The origins of streamwise (x) and span-
wise (y) coordinate systems for the forward and backward
ﬂows were selected at the middle span of each entry edge.
Thermal insulation material was wrapped over the outer
surface of the test channel to minimize the external heat
loss. Via the heat loss calibration tests, it was found that
the external-heat loss over the heat transfer surface
increased with the increase of wall-to-ambient temperature
diﬀerence. As the wall temperatures over the roughened
surface were not uniformly distributed, local heat loss
ﬂuxes varied spatially. With a uniform heat ﬂux supplied
from the Minco thermal foil, the convective heat ﬂux over
the heat transfer surface was not perfectly uniform. Axial
distributions of convective heat ﬂux were obtained by sub-
tracting the local heat loss ﬂux from the total heat ﬂux sup-
plied. A review for the entire data of convective heat ﬂux
revealed that the non-uniformities in heat ﬂux distributions
were less than 9.1% due to the small amount of external
heat loss. Therefore, the basically uniform heat ﬂux heating
condition was simulated by the present test rig.
Measurements of pressure drop were performed sepa-
rately at isothermal conditions. To measure the pressure
drop across the test channel at each predeﬁned Reynolds
number, two ﬂexible tubes were equipped with pressure
taps of 0.5 mm diameter at two origins of the coordinate
systems speciﬁed in Fig. 1b. A short 1 mm diameter stain-
less steel tube was glued on the top of each pressure tap-
ping to connect the ﬂexible tube. Pressure diﬀerences
between these two taps were metered by a digital type
micromanometer with precision of 0.001 mm-H2O. This
arrangement for pressure-drop measurements absorbed
the friction loss in the developing ﬂow region. As a part
of the coolant ﬂow inside a gas turbine blade was under
developing, the present arrangement for pressure-drop
measurements oﬀered the overall assessments for the ﬂow
resistance over the entire test channel, which generated
the higher levels of pressure drop than those acquired from
the developed ﬂow regime.
2.2. Program and data processing
Heat transfer and pressure drop tests were performed
with the airﬂows directed in the forward and backward
S.W. Chang et al. / International Journal odirections at Re = 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000,
20,000, 25,000 and 30,000. This tested Re range coveredboth laminar and turbulent ﬂows. Streamwise heat transfer
variations along the centerline of the roughened surface
and pressure drops across the test channel at various Rey-
nolds numbers were examined. As the top face of each scale
was deepened into the heated wall with an inclined angle
(aS) and the V-ribs were pointed in the downstream direc-
tion, performances of heat transfer and pressure drop in
the test channel were aﬀected by the direction of ﬂow.
Inﬂuences of Re and ﬂow direction on the local and spa-
tially averaged heat transfers, the pressure drops and the
thermal performance factors were analyzed for this partic-
ular test channel roughened by the compound V-ribs and
scales. The HTE ratios, friction augmentations and ther-
mal performance factors between the present test channel
and those collected from a variety of enhanced channels
were compared to highlight the superiority of present com-
pound HTE technique. Empirical correlations that evalu-
ated the spatially averaged heat transfer rates and the
overall friction coeﬃcients in the present test channel at
both forward and backward ﬂow conditions were gener-
ated for design applications.
Heat transfer measurements were performed under
steady-state conditions. The steady state was assumed
when the variations of local wall temperatures with several
successive scans were less than 0.3C. The elapsed time to
achieve the steady state generally took 30 min after the
heating power or ﬂow rate was adjusted. The various heat
ﬂuxes fed into the heating foil aﬀected the Reynolds num-
ber at the ﬂow entrance even if the airﬂow rate remained
invariant due to the thermal impact on ﬂuid properties.
After the adequate adjustment of coolant mass ﬂow rate
to compensate the thermal impact on Re value, maximum
variations in Reynolds number at the entry plane of test
channel were controlled within ±1% deviation from the
targeting value. Reynolds number (Re) and local Nusselt
number (Nu) were experimentally deﬁned using Eqs. (1)
and (2), respectively,
Re ¼ qW md=l ð1Þ
Nu ¼ qd=½kfðT w  T bÞ ð2Þ
The symbols of q, Wm, d and l in Eq. (1) are the ﬂuid den-
sity, bulk mean ﬂow velocity, hydraulic-diameter of test
channel and viscosity of ﬂuid, respectively. The local con-
vective heat ﬂux (q) in Eq. (2) was obtained by subtracting
the local heat loss ﬂux from the supplied heat ﬂux over the
electrical heating foil. The heating surface adopted to eval-
uate the supplied and lost heat ﬂuxes was the projected area
of the V-ribs and scales. Having determined the local con-
vective heat ﬂux, the local Nusselt number (Nu) was deﬁned
using Eq. (1). All the ﬂuid properties appeared in Eqs. (1)
(2) were evaluated from the local ﬂow bulk temperature, Tb.
Dimensionless pressure drops over the test channel were
evaluated as the Fanning friction factors (Cf) using the
pressure drops (DP) across the test channel of length L with
mean ﬂow velocity (Wm) as

f HeS.W. Chang et al. / International Journal oFig. 5a. Fanning friction factors for the present test chan-
nel with forward ﬂows constantly operate at the lower lev-
els than the backward-ﬂow counterparts. This result agrees
with our previous work that examined the variations of
Fanning friction factor against Re in the scale-roughened
channel [19]. In the range of 1000 6 Re 6 30,000, Fanning
frictions factors in the present test channel with forward
and backward ﬂows are, respectively, correlated as

Augmentations of friction factor from the smooth-walled
tube levels for the present compound HTE roughness are
indexed by the Cf/Cf1 ratios. Fig. 5b plots the variations
of Cf/Cf1 ratio against Re for forward and backward ﬂows
Fig. 4. Comparison of present Nusselt number raat and Mass Transfer 51 (2008) 457–468 465in which the Cf/Cf1 data reported for varieties of single
and compound HTE measures are included for compari-
son. The Cf/Cf1 ratios for the present test channel and
the scaled roughened channel of H/W = 1/8 [19] are among
the highest magnitudes between the comparative groups
collected in Fig. 5b. In the present test channel of aspect ra-
tio (H/W) = 1/2, the compound surface roughness that
consolidates protruding V-ribs and deepened scales con-
stantly exhibits the higher Cf/Cf1 ratios than those coun-
terparts in the scale roughened channel of H/W = 1/8
due to the additional pressure drops induced by V-ribs. Ra-
tios of Cf/Cf1 for the present forward and backward ﬂows
also decrease with the increase of Re which fall, respec-
tively, in the ranges of 32.4–16.8 and 46.7–27.7. The signif-
icant HTE impacts observed in Fig. 4 for the present test
channel are accompanying with the high pressure drop
tios ððNu=Nu1Þ with varieties of HTE devices.

laminar ﬂows, the thermal performance factors in present
test channel and the scale-roughened channel [19] increase
as Re increases. This particular data trend reverses the typ-
ical results found in the rib-roughened channels and dem-
onstrates the superiority of present compound HTE
roughness in thermal performances for laminar ﬂows. With
Re < 3000, thermal performance factors for the present for-
ward and backward ﬂows are considerably higher than the
comparative groups shown in Fig. 6. Once again, the ther-
mal performance factors for the present compound HTE
roughness with forward turbulent ﬂows score the highest
values among the various single and compound HTE mea-
sures compared in Fig. 6. Even for the backward ﬂows with
Re > 20,000, the g values are higher than those developed
Fig. 6. Comparison of present thermal performat and Mass Transfer 51 (2008) 457–468 467in the channel ﬁtted with discrete ribs. In view of the com-
parative results depicted in Figs. 4 and 6, the present com-
pound HTE roughness with forward ﬂows simultaneously
oﬀer the highest values of Nu=Nu1 and g that is suitable
for cooling applications of gas turbine blades for which
the structure integrity of the roughness itself is satisﬁed.
4. Conclusions
A novel compound HTE roughness that consolidates
the deepened scales and protruding V-ribs is developed.
In the range of 1000 6 Re 6 30,000, the performances of
heat transfer and pressure drop in a rectangular channel

channel are also influenced by the trade-offs between these 
streamwise enhanced HTE mechanisms against the thickened 
boundary layers. Such trade-offs elevate heat transfer rates 
progressively over the first 3-4 pin-rows. The different flow 
conditions over the surfaces around pin-fins and on the 
endwalls generate the higher HTE effects on pin surfaces by 
35% [3] or 10-20% [4] over those on endwalls. These flow 
features generalize the heat transfer performances in a static 
pin-fin channel but the detailed HTE effects vary with the 
height-to-diameter ratios of pins [5-7], shapes of pin-fin [9], 
pin-fin arrangements [10-12] and the orientation of pin-array 
in the cross flow [13-14]. These geometric factors [5-14] are 
interrelated to affect the endwall cooling performances. 
Among the various pin-fin geometries, the staggered diamond 
pin-fin array with pitch ratios of 1.5-2.5 pin-diameters offers 
the considerable HTE effects; while the elliptical pins offer 
the higher thermal performance factors [15]. 
 
Although the rotating pin-fin channel has a long term history 
of cooling application to turbine rotor blade, the heat transfer 
study with rotation is very rare [16] and the detailed flow 
measurements are not available in the literature. The 
pioneering heat transfer study for rotating pin-fin channel [16] 
is limited at low rotation rates with no attempt to investigate 
both rotational buoyancy effects and spanwise heat transfer 
variations over two opposite rotating endwalls. Heat transfer 
correlations as the design references for the rotating pin-fin 
channels are also absent. The lack of experimental heat 
transfer data and its correlations for rotating pin-fin channels 
motivates this study. Nevertheless, the evaluations of heat 
transfer rates in a rotating pin-fin channel need to consider the 
Coriolis and centrifugal force effects which act 
simultaneously and interact with the pin-fins to generate the 
complex flow structures. The synergistic Coriolis and 
buoyancy effects modify the endwall cooling performances 
from the non-rotating conditions in the rotating pin-fin 
channel; while the degrees and extents of such impacts are the 
research focus for this study. 
 
In general, Coriolis forces affect mean flows and turbulent 
fluctuations considerably. The cross stream Coriolis secondary 
flows drive the relatively cool fluids from the channel core 
towards the unstable wall and return to the stable wall after 
washing the peripheries of a rotating channel. But with the 
presence of pin-fin array in the rotating channel, the Coriolis 
secondary flows are considerably disturbed with less 
opportunities to generate the three dimensional Taylor-Görtler 
roll cells which normally develop at high rotation rates [17]. 
However, the mechanism for producing turbulences triggered 
by the momentum exchange through intensive interactions 
between the fluctuating streamwise and cross-stream 
velocities still prevails in a rotating pin-fin channel within 
which the turbulent activities are augmented as Coriolis forces 
act in tandem with these events but are attenuated when the 
two act in opposition [18]. Heat transfer differences between 
the stable and unstable endwalls of a rotating pin-fin channel 
are realized as a result of Coriolis force effects. With heat 
convection taking place inside a rotating pin-fin channel, the 
interaction between centrifugal acceleration and density 
gradients of fluids due to temperature differences vary the 
volumetric body forces to large extents since the centrifugal 
acceleration reaches the order of above 104g. This rotational 
buoyancy force motivates the warmer and less dense fluids 
towards the axis of rotation and alters the heat transfer 
performance by way of distorting the velocity and temperature distributions with turbulence structures modified. Features of 
the combinative effects between rotating buoyancy and 
Coriolis secondary flows that interact with the roughness 
elements such as surface ribs [19] are highly complicated and 
interrelated. In this respect, there is no previous attempt 
available to examine the interactive and individual buoyancy 
impacts on heat transfer in a rotating pin-fin channel which 
will be examined in details here. Because the buoyancy effects 
in a rotating channel are relevant to the structures of 
mean-flow and turbulence, the effects of rotating buoyancy on 
heat transfer deem to be Reynolds number (Re), rotation 
number (Ro) and location dependent as suggested by various 
research groups [20-27]. But due to the limitation on the range 
of rotational parameters examined and the various rotating 
buoyancy effects reported to date [20-27], the impacts of 
rotating buoyancy on heat transfer at the engine representative 
conditions remain unclear. 
 
Most of the previous laboratory-scale heat transfer 
experiments used simplified blade cooling geometry to 
examine heat transfer performances in these rotating channels 
at low Ro and low Bu [17-27]. Only few of the previous 
studies simulate closely the real engine scenarios by operating 
experimental tests at conditions of Ro>1 [28-30]. This 
experimental study examines endwall heat transfer 
performances for a radially rotating rectangular pin-fin 
channel with the aspect ratio of 8. Local endwall heat transfer 
measurements along two opposite pairs of streamwise 
centerlines and spanwise centerlines between two adjacent 
pin-rows in the developed flow regime are generated with the 
rotating parameters, namely Ro and Bu, extended considerably 
from the past experiences. Heat transfer performances in 
association with the individual and interactive effects of Re, 
Ro and Bu are illustrated along the line of developing the 
empirical heat transfer correlations. These empirical heat 
transfer equations not only stand for the entire set of heat 
transfer data generated with the capabilities to uncouple the 
individual but mutually interactive Ro and Bu effects on heat 
transfer but also determine the spanwise- averaged Nusselt 
numbers ( Nu ) in the developed flow region. However, this set 
of Nu  correlations is limited to determine the endwall heat 
transfer performance. The operational conditions with the 
worst endwall heat transfer scenarios for this rotating pin-fin 
channel are parametrically identified using the heat transfer 
correlations generated by this study. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
Rotating test rig and heat transfer test module 
The constructional details of this rotating test rig and its 
instrumentations for measurements of flow-rate, heat-flux and 
temperature as well as the data acquisition system have been 
previously reported [28]. The 420mm long pin-fin test 
channel is mounted on the platform of the rotating rig giving 
the mid-span radius (R) of 420mm. The maximum rotational 
speed of heat transfer test channel is 500 rev/min. The 
pressurized and dehumidified test coolant (dry airflow) is 
channeled through a set of pressure regulator and filter, a 
pressure transducer, a mass flow meter and a needle valve that 
controls the mass airflow rate into the pin-fin test channel. Air 
flows radially outward through the rotating pin-fin channel. 
Fig. 1(a) depicts the heat transfer test section that shows the 
assembly of the test module and the geometry of the pin-fin 
array. The origin of the present X-Y coordinates is located at 
the mid-span of the bottom edge of the endwall as indicated in

In equation (1), the experimentally defined Nusselt number 
(Nu) is calculated by equation (2). Re, Ro and Bu are defined 
in the nomenclature section. The boundary conditions as well 
as the coordinate system adopted here are specified by the 
heat transfer test section as described in the previous section.

The local convective heat flux (q) in equation (2) is obtained 
by subtracting the external heat loss flux from the total heat 
flux supplied. The heating area selected to calculate the heat 
flux is the endwall area with the pin-fin sectional areas 
deducted. Heat loss calibration tests are performed to generate 
the correlation between external heat-loss fluxes and the 
wall-to-ambient temperature differences at various rotational 
speeds. This set of heat loss correlation is incorporated into 
the data processing program to evaluate local heat loss fluxes 
and consequently the local convective heat fluxes. The 
maximum heat loss flux takes place at the test conditions with 
the highest rotational speed and wall temperatures, which is 
about 8.9% of the total heat flux supplied. Having determined 
the local convective heat flux (q) at each axial station where 
the wall temperature (Tw) is detected, the local enthalpy 
balance is accounted to calculate the fluid bulk temperature 
(Tb) at this particular Tw spot. To check the accuracy of such 
energy accountancy, the calculated and measured Tb values at 
the flow exit are constantly compared when the heat transfer 
tests are performing. Only the raw data can be collected for 
subsequent processing when the differences between the 
calculated and measured Tb values are lesser than 10%. All the 
fluid properties used to define the dimensionless parameters in 
equation (1) are evaluated at these Tb values. Table 1 
summarizes the parametric conditions examined here. The 
maximum Re and Ro in Table 1 are not simultaneously 
attainable. The present ranges of Ro and Bu are considerably 
extended from the previous experiences [16-27] by increasing 
test pressures and the channel hydraulic diameter (d). Test 
pressures are controlled in the range of 1.1-2.4 bars that allow 
for the full coverage of the parametric conditions summarized 
in Table 1.

The present experimental programs perform heat transfer tests 
at static and rotating conditions with a final phase of deriving 
Nu  correlations. Steady state heat transfer measurements are 
carried out at both static and rotating conditions. The steady 
state condition is assumed when the temporal Tw variations 
after several successive scans are lesser than +0.30C. 
Generally, the flow and heater power have to be kept for 
about 45 minutes in order to satisfy such steady state criterion. 
The heat transfer results obtained from the static pin-fin 
channel are compared with the relevant data available for 
validation. This set of heat transfer data obtained at the 
zero-rotating speed is treated as the database against which the 
heat transfer results detected from the rotating channel are

4ompared. Each set of heat transfer data generated by the 
otating pin-fin channel is produced at fixed Re and Ro by 
djusting the rotational speed, coolant mass flow rate and the 
ressure level. At each Re-Ro tested, four heater powers that 
aise the highest Tw levels to 363, 383, 403, and 423 K are 
upplied to generate four different steady state conditions with 
ifferent buoyancy levels. These four sets of heat transfer data 
re acquired at fixed Re and Ro with four ascending buoyancy 
evels which reflect the isolated Bu effect on local Nu. 
owever, adjustments of heat flux vary local Tb values and 
ccordingly vary the fluid properties such as viscosity and 
hermal conductivity of the test coolant (dry air). To control 
e and Ro at the flow entrance within the maximum 
eviations of +1% from the targeting values, the mass airflow 
ates are frequently adjusted so that the changes of fluid 
roperties due to variations in Tb are compensated. 
 
or heat transfer tests, the acquisition of experimental heat 
ransfer data requires the finite wall-to-fluid temperature 
ifference which inevitably inherits certain degrees of 
uoyancy impact on heat transfer results. Therefore an 
dditional set of data that is needed to separate Re or Ro 
mpact from Bu interaction is alternatively obtained by 
xtrapolating the rotational heat transfer data into the limiting 
ondition of Bu=0 while Re and Ro remain as the targeting 
est values. This regression process generates a set of Nu data 
t the zero-buoyancy conditions with which the analysis of 
ndividual Re or/and Ro effects on Nu or Nu  can be 
erformed. Having realized the individual and 
nter-correlative relationships between Re, Ro and Bu on heat 
ransfer, a set of Nu  correlations is derived to evaluate the 
ndividual and interactive effects of Re, Ro and Bu on Nu  
long the leading and trailing endwalls in the developed flow 
egion of the rotating pin-fin channel. Typical HTE effects 
enerated by various surface enhancements for rotating 
hannels are also compared with the present pin-fin channel to 
eveal the different degrees of rotational impacts on heat 
ransfer. The uncertainty analysis indicates that the most of 
xperimental uncertainties result from the temperature 
easurements because the fluid properties are estimated from

ESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
tatic results 
n the static channel, the Tw measurements at two opposite 
eading and trailing endwalls exhibit negligible differences 
ue to the lack of rotational forces. But the axial and spanwise 
w variations generally show the lower Tw value behind the 
in relative to its adjacent location in front of the pin. Fig. 2-a 
ypifies such axial Tw variations along leading and trailing 
enterlines at Re = 15000. Local bulk temperature (Tb) 
epicted in Fig. 1-a increases linearly along the test channel. 
he locations behind and in front of a pin are respectively 
eferred to the notations as BP and FP hereafter. As the 
xperimental heating condition on each of the two opposite 
eading and trailing endwalls corresponds closely to the 
niform heat flux, the axial and spanwise Nu0 variations 
eassemble the zigzag pattern of Tw variations with the higher 
u0 values at the BP locations. By way of normalizing the Nu0 
alue with Dittus-Boelter Nusselt number (Nu∞) [32], the HTE

ratios cited in [33] are the spatially averaged Nu0 values 
calculated from the full-surface Nu0 distributions over the 
entire endwall, the spanwise-averaged 0Nu  value defined by 
this study seems to be close to the spatially averaged Nu0 
value. The validation demonstrated in Fig. 3 seems to be 
satisfactory. The 0Nu  correlations at BP and FP locations are 
respectively derived as equations (3) and (4) to level the 
averaged heat transfer performances in the developed flow 
region of the present static pin-fin channel.

Rotational heat transfer results in general 
It is a well known fact in this technical community that the 
Coriolis secondary flows convect the cooler fluids from the 
duct-core to the trailing edge with the heated coolant flowing 
along the periphery of the rotating duct toward the leading 
edge when the mainstream of airflow is radially outward. This 
is referred to a major impact of Coriolis forces on mean flow 
fields as the so-called Coriolis washing effect. However, in the 
rotating pin-fin channel, the Coriolis secondary flows are 
constantly disturbed by the pin-fin array. But the velocity 
components driven by Coriolis and rotating buoyancy forces 
can still affect the vortical flows tripped by pin-fins as well as 
the turbulent structures. In addition, the Coriolis forces 
generate the spanwise pressure gradient that modifies the local 
flow instability phenomena with the turbulence promoted and 
suppressed at the unstable (trailing) and stable (leading) 
endwalls respectively. These interactive effects produce heat 
transfer differences between the leading and trailing endwalls 
with the higher heat transfer rates on the trailing endwall. 
With the basically uniform heat flux heating condition, 
leading Tw values constantly operate at the higher levels than 
the trailing counterparts as typified by Fig. 4-a.

Fig. 4 (a) axial Tw and Tb variations (b) axial Nu/Nu∞ variations 
along centerlines on leading and trailing endwalls with different 
Δρ/ρ at Re = 5000, Ro = 1.4. 
 By way of normalizing the rotational endwall Nusselt 
number (Nu) with Nu∞, the HTE effects produced by the 
pin-fin array in the rotating channel are revealed. Fig. 4-b 
typifies the axial distributions of Nu/Nu∞ along two opposite 
centerlines over leading and trailing endwalls with four 
different Δρ/ρ ratios at Re = 5000, Ro = 1.4. The heat transfer 
levels along the centerline of trailing endwall constantly 
operate at the higher values than those leading counterparts 
due to the Coriolis force effects. Unlike the static pin-fin 
channel in which the buoyancy effect is non-existent, four 
pairs of descending Nu/Nu∞ profiles along each centerline on 
leading or trailing endwall are driven by increasing Δρ/ρ at the 
fixed Re and Ro showed in Fig. 4-b. This clearly demonstrates 
the impairing buoyancy effect on heat transfer on both leading 
and trailing endwalls.  
 
Fig. 5 depicts the spanwise variations of Nu/Nu∞ over the 
leading (a) and (b) trailing endwalls in the developed flow 
region (x/d = 7.14) of the rotating pin-fin channel at Re = 
5000.

Fig. 5 Spanwise distributions of Nu/Nu∞ over (a) leading and (b) 
trailing endwalls with Re = 5000, Δρ/ρ = 0.15, Ro = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 
1.4 at 7.14 x/d location. 
 
As seen in Fig. 5-a where Nu/Nu∞ obtained with Ro = 0, 0.1, 
0.5 and 1.4 with Δρ/ρ ≈ 0.15 are compared, the increase of Ro 
from 0 to 0.1 reduces heat transfer levels from the Nu0 
reference on the leading endwall. Further increasing Ro from 
0.1 to 0.5, Nu/Nu∞ starts increasing on the leading endwall. 
With Ro>0.5, Nu/Nu∞ increases with the increase of Ro on the 
leading endwall. On the trailing endwall as showed in Fig. 5-b, 
the increase of Ro from 0 to 1.4 produces the consistent heat 
transfer elevations from the Nu0 reference. Such heat transfer 
characteristics found in this rotating pin-fin channel on the 
leading and trailing endwalls follow those found in the 
rotating channels operating at high Ro [28-30]. It is also worth 
comparing the attendant variations in the spanwise Nu/Nu∞ 
profiles over the leading and trailing endwalls as Ro increases. 
In Figs. 5-a, the spanwise zigzag pattern are systematically 
moderated as Ro increases from 0 to 1.4. But such spanwise 
zigzag Nu/Nu∞ patterns are persistent over the trailing endwall 
as seen in Fig. 5-b. It has previously stated that the different 
heat transfer values at the BP and LP locations are produced 
due to the endwall vortices tripped by pin-fins. The Coriolis 
forces directing toward the trailing endwall of this rotating 
pin-fin channel seem to lift the endwall vortices from the

enables the isolation of Re effect from the synergistic Ro-Bu 
impacts on Nu by presenting the rotational heat transfer data 
in terms of Nu/Nu0. The axial Nu/Nu0 profile displayed in each 
plot of Fig. 7 can therefore be treated as the streamwise 
development of the combined Ro-Bu effects on Nu. In view of 
all the plots collected in Fig. 7, the axial Nu/Nu0 profiles 
follow a general pattern with an initial fall of Nu/Nu0 at the 
flow entry region where the boundary layers and Coriolis 
secondary flow are both developing. The values of Nu/Nu0 
gradually evolve into the two asymptotic values in the 
developed flow region after the airflow traverses about four 
pin-rows where the vortices tripped by pin-fins are developed. 
Over the entire length of the rotating pin-fin channel, the 
higher Nu/Nu0 ratios consistently develop at the trailing edge 
relative to its leading counterpart. The leading-wall heat 
transfer impediments from the non-rotation conditions 
develop at Ro = 0.05 and 0.1. These combined Ro-Bu impacts 
on axial Nu/Nu0 profiles typified by Fig. 7 are followed by all 
the test results obtained with different heat flux settings. 
 
Parametric analysis of rotational results 
The parametric analysis identifies the functional structures of 
Nu versus Re, Bu and Ro to reflect the heat transfer physics in 
this rotating pin-fin channel. The individual and interactive Re, 
Bu and Ro impacts on heat transfer have to be examined along 
with the development of heat transfer correlation. As 
described previously, the seven spanwise Nu measurements at 
the BP and FP locations in the developed flow region over the 
leading or trailing endwall of the rotating pin-fin channel are 
averaged as Nu . The processes of generating the Nu  
correlation with the associated heat transfer physics illustrated 
are summarized in this section. Initially, the isolation of Re 
impacts generate the synergistic Ro-Bu effects on Nu  is 
permitted by presenting the heat transfer data in terms of 
Nu / 0Nu . This is confirmed by the converged Nu / 0Nu  
obtained with different Re but at the same values of Ro and Bu. 
With the Re impacts isolated, the individual Bu effect on heat 
transfer is analyzed by plotting Nu / 0Nu  against Bu at BP and 
FP locations on leading and trailing endwalls. Fig. 8 depicts 
the variations of Nu / 0Nu   against Bu at Ro = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 
0.7, 1 and 1.4.

Fig. 8 Variations of Nu / 0Nu  against Bu at fixed Ro of 0.1, 0.3, 
0.5, 0.7, 1 and 1.4. 
 
With each Ro tested, the Nu / 0Nu  descends linearly as Bu 
increases. Due to the negative slopes for all the Ro controlled 
data trends as seen in the plots of Fig. 8, the isolated Bu effect 
impairs heat transfer within the range of parametric conditions 
tested here. But the magnitude of the slope for each data series 
as shown in Fig. 8 systematically decreases as Ro increases. 
8The degrees of impairing buoyancy impact on heat transfer 
in this rotating pin-fin channel are consistently weakened as 
Ro increases. Such inter-correlative Ro-Bu structure needs to 
be considered in the Nu  correlation.  
 
The subsequent analysis is devised to reveal the individual Ro 
effect on heat transfer. But it is not practical to uncouple the 
Bu effects from the Ro controlled thermal physics based on 
the direct heat transfer measurements as the finite 
wall-to-fluid temperature differences, and therefore the 
buoyancy interactions, are inevitable. In this respect, an 
additional set of zero-buoyancy heat transfer data is generated 
by extrapolating each Ro controlled data series as seen in the 
plot of Fig. 8 to the limiting condition of Bu=0 using the 
regressive type of analysis. As the data trend with a fixed Ro 
in each plot of Fig. 8 follows a general trend of linear 
variation, the extrapolating process adopts the linear curve 
fitting routine that leads to the generation of Nu / 0Nu  data 
corresponding to zero β(Tw-Tb). These fitted lines as well as 
the Nu / 0Nu   ratios at the zero-buoyancy condition are 
showed in Fig. 8. The Nu / 0Nu  ratios over the leading and 
trailing endwalls at the BP and FP locations are accordingly 
correlated by equation (5).

In equation (5), φ 1 and φ 2 are functions of Ro. The φ 1 
function evaluates the Nu / 0Nu   ratios at the zero-buoyancy 
condition that quantifies the individual Coriolis force effects 
on heat transfer. The interactive mechanism between the 
Coriolis forces and rotating buoyancy is captured as φ2 
function by taking into the account of the various Ro 
controlled slopes for the fitted lines shown in Fig. 8. A 
physical interpretation of these φ 2 values is the various 
degrees of buoyancy impact on Nu / 0Nu . The negative φ 2 
values signify the impairing heat transfer impacts; while the 
magnitudes of φ 2 index the degree of Bu impacts on heat 
transfer. Fig. 9 displays the varying manner of φ 1 value, which 
represents the Nu / 0Nu   at zero-buoyancy condition, against 
Ro at BP and FP locations.

Conclusions 
This experimental study simulates closely both parametric and 
geometric conditions of a rotating pin-fin channel with 
cooling applications to the typical coolant passage inside the 
trailing edge of a gas turbine rotor blade. The Ro range of 
0-1.4 examined here considerably extends previous 
experiences with the first time heat transfer data generated by 
this study. Several concluding remarks are obtained as 
follows. 
1. Local Nu0 values over the first 3-4 pin-rows along the 
pin-fin channel increase progressively toward the 
asymptotic levels as the trade-off between the thickened 
downstream boundary layers and the streamwise 
enhanced HTE mechanisms tripped by pin-rows. The 
spanwise heat transfer variations show the zigzag patterns 
with the higher heat transfer rates at BP locations. With 
5000<Re<20000, the range of Nu0/Nu∞ falls between 3.1 
and 2.3. The reduced Nu0/Nu∞ (HTE ratio) as Re increases 
indicates the HTE effect produced by this pin-fin array is 
Re dependent. The spanwise-averaged 0Nu  correlations 
at BP and LP locations are derived as equations (3) and 
(4). 
2. Rotational heat transfer rates on trailing endwall are 
constantly higher than those leading counterparts with the 
rotating buoyancy effects impair local heat transfer. The 
increase of Ro from 0 to 0.1 reduces heat transfer levels 
on leading endwall from the Nu0 references. But the heat 
transfer levels on leading endwall are subsequently 
increased as Ro increases from 0.1 to 1.4. On the trailing 
endwall, the increase of Ro produces consistent heat 
transfer elevations from the Nu0 references. Along with 
these typical rotational effects on local Nu, the spanwise 
zigzag Nu patterns over the leading endwall are 
systematically moderated as Ro increases; but the 
spanwise zigzag Nu patterns are still persistent on the 
trailing endwall. Acting by the Coriolis forces, the 
endwall vortices tripped by pin-rows attach firmly on the 
trailing endwall but are lifted on the leading endwall in 
this rotating pin-fin channel. 
103. Isolations of Re effects from the synergistic Ro-Bu 
impacts on Nu is achieved by representing the rotational 
heat transfer data in terms of Nu/Nu0. Due to the 
combined Ro-Bu impacts involving the impairing Bu 
effects, the ranges of Nu / 0Nu  on the leading and trailing 
endwalls are 0.8-1.6 and 1-2.1 respectively. The upper 
bounds of maximum Nu / 0Nu  develop at the conditions 
without buoyancy impacts with Nu / 0Nu  respectively 
reaching 1.8 and 2.4 on the leading and trailing endwalls. 
The worst heat transfer scenarios develop on the leading 
endwall that lead Nu / 0Nu  to 0.89 and 0.8 at the BP and 
FP locations respectively. 
4. Increasing rotating buoyancy caused a decrease in wall 
heat transfer at all measurement locations. The relative 
decrease in heat transfer with buoyancy was greater at 
low Ro and less at the highest Ro. 
5. A set of heat transfer correlations that permits the    
evaluation of Nu  at FP and BP locations in the 
developed flow regime of present rotating pin-fin channel 
is derived to represent the experimental heat transfer data 
generated by this study with the individual and interactive 
influences of Re, Ro and Bu assessed.
