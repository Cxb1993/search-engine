and the overall efficiency and control flexibility of 
a conventional DG system will be further 
decreased if the number of energy conversion and 
storage units is increased. To improve the above 
shortcomings, this project develops an integrated 
power flow control scheme to meet 
multifunctional control requirement. The 
effectiveness of the proposed system is verified 
with comprehensive simulation studies.

二、報告內容： 
 
(一) 前言 
 
In Taiwan, most electric power generation is 
centralized in large-scale units and delivered to 
end users with long distant transmission lines at 
high voltage levels and bulky distribution systems. 
Although there are a number of operating 
advantages in using such high-capacity power 
networks, there are also many vital disadvantages; 
e.g., high-level pollutions, low efficiency in 
energy conversions, low reliability of power 
supplying and lacking of flexibility in system 
control. To eliminate some of the above 
shortcomings, it has been commonly believed that 
the distributed generation systems, which have the 
advantages of high flexibility, multifunctional and 
low impact on the environment can be 
interconnected to possible points in the electric 
power distribution systems. Based on this 
development, it is now a crucial need to seriously 
consider the efficiency and flexibility of the 
possible control strategies and the related power 
interfaces as well as the means to reduce the 
influence on power quality and stability issues 
when the distributed generation systems with 
various energy resources are introduced to the 
conventional electric power distribution systems.     
In recent years, some researchers have already 
studied the influence of distributed generation 
systems on voltage deviations and other related 
issues [l, 2] and shown that the effective use of 
such systems with proper control algorithms can 
greatly improve the flexibility, efficiency and 
power quality problems of an electric power 
distribution system. 
In recent years, Flexible AC Transmission 
Systems (FACTS) technology has been expected 
as a potential means in various power system 
control issues. FACTS is based on the use of 
power electronic controlled devices for allowing 
transmission circuits to be used to their maximum 
thermal capability [3]. In particular the FACTS 
devices aim principally to control the three main 
parameters directly affecting AC power 
transmission namely voltage, phase angle, and 
impedance. None of the FACTS devices is new in 
basic concept but the use of advanced power 
electronics has revolutionized the design and 
engineering of them. Of the reported FACTS 
controllers, the Unified Power Flow Controller 
(UPFC) was proposed for real-time control and 
dynamic compensation of ac transmission systems, 
providing the necessary functional flexibility 
required to solve many of the problems facing the 
utility industry [4]. It has been proved that a 
number of important control and optimization 
functions, which were unattainable in the past, can 
now be realized by utilizing these 
high-performance power flow controllers with the 
state-of-art computer and control technologies.  
In order to further identify the potential of 
distributed generation systems, this project aims at 
investigating the effect of the control algorithms 
on improving stability of the control system and 
the overall control effects of power quality issues; 
i.e., reactive power and harmonics 
compensations.  
 
(二) 研究目的 
 
The main objective of this research project is 
therefore to investigate a new integrated 
multifunctional power flow control scheme 
(IMPFCS) based on the hardware configuration of 
 4
FACTS technology have been proposed and 
implemented [3-10]. More recently, with its 
unique control capability, the UPFC can be used 
for power flow control, loop-flow control, load 
sharing among parallel corridors, voltage 
regulation, enhancement of transient stability and 
mitigation of power quality problems [5-10]. The 
fast active and reactive power flow control of the 
UPFC in the transmission line are influenced by 
both the amplitude and the phase angle of the 
series compensation voltage, therefore the 
performance of the UPFC system is decided by a 
variety of different controllers which are utilized 
here in this project to design new power interfaces 
for DG systems .  
 
(四) 研究方法 
 
z The configuration of IMPFCS 
 
As discussed previously, a UPFC has the 
flexibility to control either its series branch or 
shunt branch or both to achieve a desired effect on 
the power flow transmitted between two busbars 
in which the UPFC is connected. In this research 
project, the development of a IMPFCS, based on 
the basic UPFC configuration, is designed to 
provide flexible, simultaneous and real time 
control of the power flow with a variable control 
structure and system ratings. Theoretically there 
are a number of feasible solid-state 
implementations of the above mentioned IMPFCS; 
however, when practical implementation is 
considered the feasibility of circuit configuration, 
the control algorithm for a specific operating 
mode, the availability of high capacity power 
electronics, and most importantly the economical 
factors must also be taken into account. In order to 
achieve the purpose of capability transfer between 
the series and shunt branches of an IMPFCS, a 
number of small converter modules can be 
designed for the series and shunt converters. For 
the sake of simplicity, a feasible IMPFCS using a 
set of voltage sourced three-phase inverters 
operated from a common DC link capacitor 
shown in Fig. 1 has been developed as the 
prototype of a IMPFCS in this project for 
investigating the possible control modes, and the 
derivation of its mathematical models for further 
studies. The same as a conventional UPFC, an 
IMPFCS can be treated as a universal power flow 
controller with its rating and structure variable. 
Therefore, an IMPFCS has the flexibility to 
control either its series branches or shunt branches 
or a combination of them to achieve an optimal 
effect on power flow parameters and cost effective 
installations.

Fig. 1. Basic implementation of an IMPFCS 
 
z IMPFCS operating principles and control 
methods 
 
The IMPFCS operating principles and control 
concepts are the same as that of a UPFC, the basic 
IMPFCS configuration which consists of two 
switching converters using gate turn off (GTO) 
thyristor valves (Fig. 1) is chosen to introduce the 
IMPFCS operating principles. The two converters 
(series and shunt branches) in the figure are 
designed to be operated from a common DC link 
voltage provided by a DC storage capacitor.  In 
normal operations, the phase angle of the series 
voltage can be chosen independently of the line

To calculate the injected current components of 
IMPFCS system to the grid,  the related current 
and voltages signals must be transformed to 
synchronously rotating reference frame, i.e., in 
d-q components. In this transformation d-axis 
vector is in the direction of voltage vector. With 
this consideration, vertical component of voltage 
(q-component of voltage) in rotating synchronous 
reference frame is always zero.  Fig. 2 shows   
the   voltage   and   current components in 
stationary and rotating synchronous reference 
frames. Transformation matrix based on Park 
equations is given in (2):

at t=0.2 sec. After the transient time passed the 
source current becomes zero. To evaluate the 
capabilities of DG link to compensate harmonic 
currents, the spectra of various currents before 
and after connection of DG link and after 
connection of additional load are shown in Fig.6. 
The comparison between these data demonstrates 
the capabilities of DG link to compensate
