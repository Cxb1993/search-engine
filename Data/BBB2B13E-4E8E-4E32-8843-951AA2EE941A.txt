21. Background and objective
Self-assembled nanostructures have attracted great attentions in recent years due to their
extraordinary properties and numerous applications in many technological areas[1,2]. One of the
recently discovered self-assembled nanostructures is self-assembled alternating metal(-rich) and
metal-deficient layers in metal-containing amorphous carbon (a-C:Me) films[3,4]. Gerhard et al.
obtained a-C:Au and a-C:Fe thin films with alternating metal-rich layer and metal-deficient layer
using a hyperthermal ion beam sputter co-deposition technique[5]. The self-organized formation
of metal-rich and metal-deficient multilayers was attributed to a mechanism in which an interplay
between (a) the ion impact triggered atomic transport, (b) the segregation of metal atoms at the
surface, (c) the preferential sputtering of surface metal atoms, and (d) the stability of small metal
or metal carbide clusters under ion impact is considered. Corbella et al. obtained a-C:Ti thin films
with alternating nano-layers of Ti and C using a pulsed-dc reactive magnetron sputter deposition
technique[6]. The proposed mechanism involves phase segregation induced by spinodal
decomposition, which explains in a qualitative way for the formation of a-C:Ti multilayer
nanostructures. Using a dc magnetron sputter deposition technique, we obtained a-C:Cu, a-C:Ni,
and a-C:Pt thin films consisting of self-assembled alternating nano-layeres[7]. The formation of
the alternating nano-layer structures was explained by a mechanism, which considers the
difference between the metal and carbon deposition rates, and the catalytic reaction activity of
metal.
In the first mechanism mentioned above, the energy of the impinging particles plays an
important role in influencing the deposition rates. In the second mechanism, the energy of Ar ion
is also critical during the impact. In the third, we proposed, the energy is crucial in the diffusion
process involved in the self-assembled scenario. In the mean time, regardless of the differences in
the metals and the deposition techniques used in these studies, it appears that not all the
deposition conditions and the metal types lead to the formation of such interesting
microstructures. These suggest that further investigations of the effects of the impinging particle
energy or the factors affecting the energy on the synthesis and the microstructures of a-C:Me
films is required. Factors affecting the impinging particle energy include a number of deposition
parameters such as sputter gas composition, working pressure, electrode distance, and substrate
temperatures. As a result, we have investigated the effects of these deposition parameters on the
synthesis and microstructures of a-C:Me thin films deposited on various types of substrates.
2. Experimental
A dc reactive sputter deposition system equipped with one single magnetron gun was used
to deposit a-C:Cu, a-C:Pt, and a-C:Ni thin films on single crystal wafers of (100) silicon. The
target materials were platinum (99.99%), copper (99.95%), nickel (99.99%) and graphite
(99.99%). To deposit a-C:Me (Me=Pt, Cu and Ni) thin films, the sputter deposition chamber was
first evacuated to a pressure lower than 5x10-5torr and then back-filled with an argon/methane gas
mixture to a working deposition pressure of 1x10-2 or 5x10-2 torr. The CH4 concentration used
were 0% to 75%; while the total flow rate was 15 sccm. The dc powers used was 100 W. The
4The deposition rate is also affected by other deposition parameters. We first present the
effects of working pressure and electrode distance. The three curves shown in Fig. 3A compares
deposition rates for a-C:H/Cu films obtained under different pressures and electrode distances as
the CH4 concentration varies. The comparison is focused on the second stage and the third stage.
It is obvious that the deposition rate decreases with the CH4 concentration in transition mode
(stage 2). The methane concentration range where the transition mode occurs in each case will
be discussed later. However, all three curves decrease at different rates. The top black curve
decreases slowly and then sharply. The middle red curve decreases sharply from the beginning.
The bottom green curve decreases at the slowest rate. After the transition mode, the deposition
rate becomes almost constant in reactive mode (stage 3), i.e., when the methane concentrations
are greater than 40%. In general, it appears that a lower pressure (black curve vs. red curve) or a
shorter electrode distance (red curve vs. green curve) gives a higher deposition rate. A similar
trend was observed for the deposition of a-C:H/Ni thin films as shown in Fig. 3B. It is noted
that all three curves shown in Fig. 3B also decrease at different rates.
Now we present the effects of working power and substrate temperature. Fig. 4 shows the
deposition rates of various a-C:H/Ni thin films as a function of CH4 concentration obtain under
different dc powers (black curve vs. red curve) and substrate temperatures (black curve vs. green
curve). As mentioned above, the deposition rate decreases in the transition mode region and is
almost constant in the reactive mode region. Also, the methane concentration range where the
transition mode or the reactive mode occurs will be discussed later. Furthermore, the rate
decreases are also different for all three curves. This is to be discussed later too. In general, a
higher power gives a higher deposition rate or almost doubles the deposition rate. On the other
hand, the deposition rates obtained at different substrate temperatures are similar or differ
insignificantly.
Figs. 5A and B show respectively XTEM bright-field and high angle annular dark-field
(HAADF) images of an a-C:H/Ni thin film sample which was prepared using hand polishing and
ion milling. The deposition condition is 100W of d.c power, 28 % of CH4 concentration, 50 mm
of electrode distance, and 5x10-2 torr of working pressure. The film thickness is 850 nm and the
alternating dark and bright layers are obvious throughout the entire film thickness as shown in
Fig. 5A. It is also found that there are 34 periods with an average periodicity of 26 nm. The
HAADF image in Fig. 5B is capable of providing an enhanced contrast due to the difference in
the atomic number. An element with a higher atomic number shows a brighter contrast in
HADDF images. Therefore, the bright layers of the layered structure shown in Fig. 5B have
higher Ni contents than the dark layers. The film image shown in Fig. 5B consists of a dark
band and a bright band due to the non-uniform XTEM sample thickness as a result of the ion
milling process. A thinner section gives a darker contrast; while a thicker section gives a
brighter contrast. The layered structure was also examined using contrast scan through the dark
band in Fig, 5B. The result is given in Fig. 6A. The scan direction is from the film surface
toward to the film/substrate interface. The increasing count with the scan direction is due to the
increasing film thickness. Nevertheless, the contrast spectrum of the HAADF image consists of
6exhibit reversed wavy signals, indicating the existence of alternating a layer structure. The
average atomic concentrations of C and Pt in the dark layers are 80 and 18 at%, respectively.
The average atomic concentrations of C and Pt in the bright layers are 70 and 25 at%,
respectively.
Alternating layered structures were also analyzed using SIMS and the results are compared
with the XTEM results. Fig. 10, Fig. 11, and Fig. 12 show the XTEM images and the SIM
depth-profiles of a-C:H/Ni, a-C:H/Cu, and a-C:H/Pt thin films, respectively. The deposition
condition is 100 W of d.c power, 40 % of CH4 concentration, 50 mm of electrode distance, and
1x10-2 torr of working pressure. As seen in the XTEM image shown in Fig. 10A, the 680 nm
thick a-C:H/Ni thin film consists of 49 periods and has a periodicity of 14.2 nm. In the mean
time, the SIMS analysis (Fig. 10B) also gives zigzagged depth profiles, indicating alternating
compositions. However, not all the periods observed in the XTEM image are revealed. The
obvious compositional periods are marked by arrows. This is attributed to structural damages
during the secondary ion bombardments and the limited resolution of the SIMS used. The
SIMS analysis gives a thicker film thickness of 900 nm. The periodicity measured from SIMS
spectrum, 16.6 nm, is also longer than that (14.2 nm) measured on XTEM image.
The XTEM image of a-C:H/Cu thin film exhibiting a self-assembled layered structure is
shown in Fig. 11A. The film thickness is 970 nm and the periodicity is 16 nm. The SIMS
spectrum given in Fig. 11B shows a smaller film thickness 550 nm. The depth profile shows flat
signals of C, Ni, O, and Si. In other words, the SIMS analysis fails to give any alternating
composition. This is also attributed to structural damages during the secondary ion
bombardments and the limited resolution of the SIMS used.
Fig. 12A shows the XTEM image of an a-C:H/Pt thin film having a film thickness of 630 nm,
29 periods, and a periodicity of 21.6 nm. The SIMS spectrum given in Fig. 12B shows a clear
zigzagged depth profile. From the SIMS analysis, the film thickness was determined to be 1050
nm. However, only the C and O depth profiles show periodic variations while the Pt profile
does not. The compositional periodicity of C measured from SIMS spectrum is 18.6 nm which
is smaller than that (21.6 nm) measured on the XTEM image.
Fig. 13 shows depth-profiled AES spectra of the a-C:H/Pt thin film shown in Fig. 12A. The
deposition condition of a-C:H/Pt is 100W of d.c power, 40 % of CH4 concentration, 50 mm of
electrode distance, and 1x10-2 torr of working pressure. The data counts and the composition of
Pt, C, and O in a-C:H/Pt thin films are given as a function of the scan times as shown in Fig. 13A
and Fig. 13B, respectively. The average atomic compositions of Pt, C, and O in the a-C:H/Pt
thin film are 90, 10, and 0 at%, respectively. The average concentrations of carbon and Pt are
7.5% and 92.5% in Pt-rich (dark) layers, respectively; while in the Pt-deficient (bright) layer are
12.5% and 87.5%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 13, both C and Pt show wavy spectrum and
no oxygen exists in the a-C:H/Pt thin film. For the wavy spectra, it is noted that a Pt peak
always accompanies a C trough, and the vice versa is true. Therefore, the wavy spectra of C and
Pt verify the existence of alternating layered structure. The scan rate of AES is 3 nm/min and
the periodicity of the layered structure was determined to be 27 nm, which is longer than that
8possible some metal were observed. In the second group, nanoparticles are distributed
homogeneously in an a-C matrix. The nanoparticles are iron carbide and Fe in the case of
a-C:H/Fe thin films, nickel carbide and nickel in the case of a-C:H/Ni thin films, and pure Cu
and Pt in the cases of a-C:H/Cu and a-C:H/Pt thin films, respectively. In the last group,
a-C:H/Me thin films of a-C:H/Cu, a-C:H/Pt thin films, a-C:H/Fe, and a-C:H/Ni thin films
exhibiting unprecedented self-assembled, alternating nanolayered structures were observed.
(c) Regardless of the film structure, Cu and Pt exist as pure metal particles while Al, Si, Fe,
and Ni exist of as pure metal and/or carbide particles. The carbon exists as a connecting
network or matrix having an amorphous structure
(d) Clear relations exist among the deposition rate, metal concentration, and surface
roughness. A higher deposition rate gives a higher metal composition, a rougher surface
morphology, better crystallinity structure, and a larger average metal particle size.
(e) The most important result of the research is the discovery and explanation of
self-assembled, alternating nanolayered structures. Such a structure consists of alternating
dark and bright layers, exist from the substrate-film interface and to the film surface. A dark
layer always has a high metal concentration or lower carbon concentration tan a bright layer.
A dark layer and a bright layer constitute a period. A period has a thickness ranging from 100
to 101 nm, depending on the deposition conditions. A processing window for the formation of
self-assembled, alternating nanolayered structures have been established.
(f) Using one single sputtering gun and a rotating but not revolving substrate,
self-assembled, alternating nanolayered structures are obtained under controlled sputter
deposition conditions for selected metals, including Ni, Cu, Pt, and Fe. In other words, this
research has shown that the structures of a-C:H/Me thin films can be controlled simply using a
conventional reactive sputter deposition technique.
(g) A growth mechanism considering key issues of deposition rate of metal and carbon,
clustering of metal and carbon, segregation of carbon, catalytic effect of metal, energy of
adatom, formation of carbide, and surface diffusion of metal and carbon has been established.

Both presentations drew quite a few questions and comments.  The 
audiences were pleased with the answers and comments that I replied.  
There were also several after-conference contacts from which some 
future research directions for my own were outlined.   
In addition to my own presentation, I also enjoyed other 
presentations and the exciting exhibition.  
二、與會心得 
NanoSMat2009 covered a wide range of research and application 
relating to latest development and discoveries in nanomaterials, 
nanotechnology, materials processing, characterization, testing, 
and evaluation.  The conference was instantiated in 2005 and had 
about 500 delegates this year.  It provided a good opportunity to 
showcase my latest result to the researchers/speakers from the rest 
of the world.  It was wonderful.
