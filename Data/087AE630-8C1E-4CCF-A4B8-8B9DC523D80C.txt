2biocompatibilities for the polymerized thin
films. The deposition rates revealed by
measuring the thickness of thin films are
characterized by profilometer under various
plasma conditions. FTIR and AFM are used
to study the chemical structures and
morphology of the deposited thin films. In
order to examine the applicability of the
deposited polymers for biosensors, the
activities of the incorporated biomolecules on
deposited thin films are analyzed. Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells are cultivated on
the polymerized thin films. Both propylamine
and allylamine polymerized thin films show
enhanced cell viability than on glass slide
substrates.

2. Introduction
Plasma polymerization has demonstrated
as a promising technique in preparing thin
films for versatile applications in the fields of
anticorrosive, electrical resistors, barrier
coatings, immunosensors, and interfaces for
biomaterials [1, 2]. The advantages of plasma
polymerized thin films include pin-hole free,
great homogeneity, mechanical, chemical,
and adhesion properties [3]. Research works
have been focused on investigating important
parameters for polymerization such as the
mode of power (continuous or pulsed) and
structure of precursors [4, 5].
Considering the applications of plasma
polymerized thin films in biomaterials, one
of the critical requirements is the specific
interaction between the thin films and
biomolecules [6, 7]. Various monomers have
been chosen to prepare polymer thin films in
order to provide nitrogen-containing
functionalities which is believed to promote
cell adhesion and proliferation [1, 8].
However, few works have been done on
investigating the biocompatibility of plasma
polymerized thin films.
In this work, in order to introduce
amine-containing functionalities, saturated
propylamine and double-bond containing
allylamine are deposited by plasma onto glass
substrate for the growth of CHO cells.
Physical-chemical analyses demonstrate that
the plasma polymerization is a stable process
to produce uniform thin films containing
amine functions. The dissociation of
unsaturated structure of allylamine can be
clearly observed by FTIR characterizations.
The CHO cell viability is promoted by both
precursors up to 1.3 folds. The correlations of
current studies with the plasma operational
parameters and the functionalities of thin
films play important roles for the applications
in medical and sensor fields.
3. Materials and methods
The precursors used for plasma
polymerization, propylamine and allylamine
(Sigma-Aldrich), are used without further
purification. Figure 1 shows schematically
the plasma configurations used in the present
study. The plasma is composed by a reaction
chamber, a radio-frequency generator, and
vacuum systems. The precursors were
introduced into the reaction chamber by a
mass flow system. The gas flow was adjusted
between 10-50 sccm depending on the
conditions required for the polymerizations.
The total pressure was controlled from
50~10010-3 Torr. For thin film
4nitrogen-oxygen binding can be identified
(Figure 3b).

The chemical properties of deposited
polymers were studied by Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The IR spectra
were presented in Figure 4 to show the
effects of the applied power on the chemical
composition of the deposited thin films. For
propylamine, the thickness of the deposited
polymer is too thin to be analyzed by FITR
due to the very low deposition rate under the
applied power of 5W and 10W. For plasma
polymerized propylamine thin film, FTIR
spectra showed a wide absorption band at
3390-3360cm-1 which is originated from the
combination of primary amine, secondary
amine and imine functions. The multiple
absorption peaks between 2960-2880 and
1460-1380cm-1 are due to the methyl group
stretches of aliphatic C-H components.. The
peak at 1640cm-1 is present on the spectra of
the polymer and it is associated with C=C
alkenes or from N=N imine stretches. It is
noticeable that, for propylamine deposited
under 50W, a band at 2200cm-1 can be
observed. This specific band is associated
with the stretching vibration of nitrile groups
and it can not be found for propylamine
deposition at 30W.

allylamine deposited on KBr pellets.
The effects of applied power can be
observed more clearly by the IR spectra of
polymerized allylamine. Higher applied
power can increase the peak formation of
nitrile and methyl functions. As shown in
Figure 4c-4g, a clear formation of nitrile
groups can be observed for the applied power
up to 30W and it increased further for the
applied power at 50W. Moreover, the
absorption bands representing the vibration
of methyl groups at range 2960-2880 cm-1
and 1460-1380 cm-1 increased significantly
as the applied power increased. This suggests
that plasma polymerization resulted in the
transformation of the unsaturated groups into
saturated ones. At the same time, higher
applied power can facilitate functionalization
during polymerization processes.
In order to study the surface morphology,
the precursors were deposited on silicon
6power for deposition (10W). More research
works such as the density of amine
functionalities provided by XPS analyses and
various plasma operational parameters will
be correlated to show the applicability of
these plasma polymerized thin films for
biosensors.

For the eco and environmental sessions, most of the talks focused on the developments and
modification of existed materials into ecomaterials. The strategy includes develop new materials
such as nano materials or hybrid of various materials. The strategies include using multi-walled
carbon nanotubes, nanoribbons, or using adhesion molecules for waste removal by vanadium (iv)
benzenedicarboxylate, formaldehyde-free adhesives, copper implanted austenitic, enzyme biofuel,
dendrimers, reinforced composites, or polymer composites. Some novel catalysts are proposed,
some computational study methods are also suggested to combining with material research works.
The Photovoltaics sessions are probably the most populated sessions that many people are very
interested in providing various novel energy generation methods are discussed. For example,
different methods are discussed to develop photovoltaics by direct write methods, by PECVD, or by
heterojunction structure in terms of materials managements and costing down.
In the fields of solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells and quantum dot solar cell are heavily
discussed. These include the discussions on the thin films developments for the energy generation
cells: by using quasi-solid polymer electrolytes, diamond-like carbon and iii nitride thin-films or
highly crystalline low band-gap indolocarbazole /benzothiadiazole copolymers.
Novel catalysts or nanomaterials in the energy generation methods are also discussed by using
electrocatalysts, nanoporous metals. Platinum/carbon anodic catalyst or modificative chitosan and
carbon nanotubes supported palladium-based catalysts.
My research works actually associated with both material and biomedical sciences. Therefore,
during this conference, I am particularly interested in the sessions of “Biomaterials for Medical 
Applications”. The subjects presented in this meeting are not only trying to solve the curent 
problems but also to propose novel methods and materials. For example, due to the
highly-demanded applications in the fields of Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering, there are
extensive discussions on the synthesis and modification of Nanobiomaterials.
The most important consideration while designing a biomaterials is the biocompatibility of the
materials, the subjects focused on Cell-biomaterials Interactions and Biomaterials-Surface
Modification have drawn tremendous attention in this meeting. Novel materials have been proposed
to either integrate conventional metal, ceramic and composite into biometal, bioceramics and
multi-components composites, the newly designed materials with nano-structures with good
compatibility have also been investigated.
My paper was presented on the afternoon of the 11th of June. This is my first conference since I
returned to Taiwan and to give presentation international-wise. I am very pleased with the results of
presentation. First of all, I have got few good questions from audiences. One question as asked from
Professor Yu, from Missouri University, he has been conducting similar research topics as I did and
he is particularly interested in the plasma polymerization techniques in my lab. The second
