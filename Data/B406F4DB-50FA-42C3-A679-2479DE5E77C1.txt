  本計劃所提出之自激返馳型轉換器具有兩種操作
模式：啟動模式和穩態模式。 
 
啟動模式： 
    交流電源 Vac 通過全橋整流與啟動電阻 Rst 對閘-源
極電容 Cgs充電以驅動開關 S，如圖 4 所示。閘-源極電

模式一：[t0 ~ t1] 
 在 t = t0，齊納二極體 Dz2崩潰且開關 S 導通。在此
模式，齊納電流 Iz2流經電阻 Rb和 Rsn，如圖 6 所示。在
此同時汲-源極電流 Ids線性增加且流經電阻 Rsn。在 t = t1
時，此模式結束，電阻 Rb和 Rsn兩端的電壓達到電晶體
Q 基-射極接面的臨界電壓值。 
 
圖 6 提出之自激返馳型轉換器操作模式一 
 
模式二：[t1 ~ t2] 
    在 t = t1，電晶體 Q 導通。電容 Cgs經電晶體 Q 放電。
因此電容器 Cgs兩端的電壓開始下降，開關 S 開始截止，
如圖 7(a)所示。對於汲-源極電流 Ids，電阻 Rb、Rsn 和電
晶體 Q 組成一電流限制電路。如圖 7(b)中，在 t = t2，
端。此外，儲存在漏感 Llk_ps1的能量仍傳送到緩震電容
Csnb直到電流 Ics下降到零，如圖 11 所示。開關 S 的汲-

Summary 
In vehicular technology, the main requirements over the past 10 years were improvement of comfort and safety. A lot of new 
services and equipments were devised for these purposes. In recent years a lot of new requirements have been for sustainable 
environment. For these new requirements, improvements of the vehicle entirely depend on electronics and support of infrastructure. 
As the frst step, communication infrastructure and power infrastructure are to be involved and vehicle technology will help these 
infrastructures to cultivate new markets. In further steps required in the latter half of 21st century, total adaptation of the society will 
be needed to realize a sustainable environment.

Abstract—This paper presents the analysis and design of the 
full-bridge (FB) LC parallel resonant plasma driver at the 
radio-frequency (RF) operation with variable-inductor based 
phase control scheme. Since the switching frequency of the RF 
plasma module is mainly fixed at 13.56MHz for EMC regulation, 
the variable-inductor control scheme can adjust the 
transconductance amplitude to enable load-current regulation. 
Additionally, in order to have minimal conduction loss on the 
switches, the design criterion of the required dead-time for ZVS 
condition with the minimal circulating current of the LC parallel 
resonant tank is required. Based on the equivalent circuit models 
of the RF plasma module described prior work, the analysis and 
design of the driver for the RF plasma module are presented. 
Finally, by using the SIMPLIS® simulation software, the FB LC 
parallel resonant plasma driver with the variable-inductor based 
phase control is simulated to validate the achievement of required 
functions. Furthermore, the dead-times and lagging phases are 
obtained from the simulation results, which are compared with 
the calculated results to validate the feasibility of design criterion.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Unlike the conventional wet-type decontamination methods, 
the plasma effluents do not cause the corrosion, and destroy 
the wiring, electronic components and plastics [1-3]. Therefore, 
the plasma is suitable for the decontamination of the sensitive 
equipment and interior spaces [1-3]. The APPJ at the RF 
technology can be used in the decontamination of the large 
areas such as airfields and ships, and in the decontamination of 
the small areas such as the sensitive equipment, the military  
vehicles and human skin [1-3]. In the RF plasma driver, 
according to the standards of European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI) [4], the RF (13.56 MHz) band is 
from 13.553MHz to 13.567MHz. Since the RF band is narrow, 
the operating frequency should be fixed at 13.56 MHz. The 
variable-inductor control scheme was used to adjust the 
voltage gain of the resonant tank for the regulation of lamp 
currents [5-8]. Therefore, in this paper, the variable-inductor 
control scheme is adopted to adjust the transconductance 
amplitude of the resonant tank in the RF plasma module to 
regulate plasma current. The design criteria required for ZVS 
condition developed in prior work [9-12]. Additionally, this 
paper will discuss the design criteria of the required dead-time 
for ZVS within the variable-inductance. 
II. EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODEL OF LAAPPJ 
Fig. 1 shows the variable-inductor based FB LC parallel 
resonant plasma driver with the RF plasma module. In order to 
analyze the electrical characteristics of the APPJ in the RF 
discharging mode, the equivalent circuit models of the APPJ 
were developed in prior works [13,14]. Fig. 2 shows the 
equivalent circuit models of the RF plasma module in the 
no-discharge mode and the α mode [13,14]. According to the 
measured values of the peak voltages Vpl,pk, the peak currents 
Ipl,pk, and the time differences tθ from the experimental 
waveforms in [13,14], the parameters of the equivalent circuit 
models for the large-area atmospheric pressure plasma jet 
(LAAPPJ) in the no-discharge mode and the α mode are listed 
in Tables 1(a) and (b), respectively.

 Since the LC parallel resonant tank functions as a band-pass 
filter, the fundamental component magnitude of the input 
voltage, Vin,fund, for the trapezoid waveform, as shown in Fig. 3, 
with the RF plasma module in the no-discharge mode can be 
further simplified. Therefore, the variable-inductance, Lvar,ND, 
can be derived as Equation (7). Similarly, the lagging phase, 
θlag, is equal to the input phase difference, θin, as shown in Figs. 
1 and 3, with the RF plasma module in the α mode. Therefore, 
the variable-inductance, Lvar,α, can be derived as Equation (8).

According to the specifications, as listed in Table 2(a), the 
resonant capacitance, Cr, can be calculated as 33.2 pF by 
Equation (6). The resonant capacitance, Cr, is chosen as 39 pF 
as listed in Table 2(b). The minimal and maximal 
variable-inductance, Lvar,ND, can be calculated as 1.9 μH and 
2.64 μH by Equation (7), respectively. Considering the 
resonant capacitance, Cr, tolerance, 39pF±10%, the minimal 
and maximal variable-inductance, Lvar,min and Lvar,max, can be 
calculated as 1.16 μH and 2.53 μH by Equation (8). According 
to the specifications and parameters, as listed in Tables 1 and 2, 
the curves of the dead-time percentage vs. the peak resonant 
current can be plotted as shown in Fig. 4 by Equations (1), (2), 
(4) and (5), respectively.

Fig. 4. Curves of dead-time percentage vs. peak resonant current with RF 
plasma module: (a) no-discharge mode, and (b) α mode. 
 In Fig. 4, the peak plasma current, Ipl,pk, should be greater 
than the minimum value of the peak plasma current, Ipl,pk,min, 
for ZVS condition. If the dead-time, td, is fixed, the maximal 
percentages, Dtd,max, of dead-time over the switching period 
should be larger than the minimal percentages, Dtd,min, of the 
dead-time for achieving ZVS condition. Meanwhile, the 
minimum value of the peak resonant current, Ir,pk, can be 
obtained as 6.9A, as shown in Fig. 4(b). If the dead-time is the 
variable time, the minimum value of the peak resonant current, 
Ir,pk, can be obtained as 4.6A, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Therefore, 
the variable dead-time control [15-20] is required to achieve 
the minimal peak resonant current, Ir,pk and conduction loss. 
Fig. 5 shows the curves of the transconductance amplitude, 
|Ipl/Vin|, and the input impedance phase, Zin, vs. the inductances, 
Lvar. Since the minimal variable-inductance, Lvar,min, is not 
adjusted in the region for ZVS condition, as shown in Figs. 5(a) 
and 5(c), the phase-locked loop control is required to adjust 
the variable-inductance, Lvar, to ensure the input impedance, 
Zin, in inductive mode.

Design Criteria for Resonant Tank of

Abstract- This paper presents the design criteria for the resonant 
tank of the LLC resonant DC-DC converter. In order to have 
high efficiency within wide input voltage range, high power 
factor for the LLC resonant tank should be ensured. The 
inductance ratio of the series and parallel resonant inductors is 
designed according to the voltage gain and input power factor of 
the LLC resonant tank. Finally, the prototype circuit of the full-
bridge LLC resonant converter with 48V output voltage at 12A 
output current is built to verify the proposed design criteria for 
the resonant tank. 
  
Key words- resonant tank, DC-DC converter, LLC resonant 
converter, zero-voltage switching, soft-switching 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, it has been a world-wide trend to reduce 
the volume of switching power supplies by increasing the 
switching frequency [1]. However, the high frequency causes 
low efficiency because of high switching losses. Since the 
resonant converter has ZVS or ZCS function for reducing 
switching losses, the resonant converter has been widely used 
in Power industry [2].  
The LLC resonant DC-DC converter, as shown in Figure 
1, is composed of the bridge driver; the LLC resonant tank 
and the rectified DC load [3-4]. Figure 2 shows the LLC DC-
DC resonant tank excited with an AC source Vin(s). This 
LLC resonant tank is composed of series resonant capacitor 
Cr, series resonant inductor Lr, parallel resonant inductor Lm, 
and equivalent load resistor Req. The voltage gain curves of 
the LLC resonant tank is shown in Figure 3. When the 
operating frequency is higher than the frequency at peak 
voltage gain of LLC resonant tank with different load 
conditions, the MOSFETs achieve ZVS condition in their 
turn-on transition [4-8]. 
Considering the required hold-up time for DC-DC 
converters, the DC-bus capacitor CDC-BUS discharges its 
stored energy to the load side through the converter within 
the hold-up time of 20mS after the input voltage source 
blacks out [7-9]. The minimum DC-bus voltage VDCmin of the 
DC-DC converters during the hold-up time can be obtained 
in Equation (1).

where  
VDCnor is the normal input voltage,   
thu is hold-up time, 
PO is the output power of DC-DC converter, and 
CDC_bus is the value of DC-bus capacitor. 
 
For the 330μF capacitor on 400V DC-bus in the 576W 
LLC DC-DC resonant converter, the minimum DC-bus 
voltage to fulfill the required hold-up time of 20mS can be 
calculated as 300V at full load condition from Equation (1). 
While the DC-bus voltage falls down from 400V to 300V 
after the DC voltage source fails, the operating frequency of 
the LLC DC-DC resonant converter is decreased in order to 
increase the voltage gain to regulate the output voltage within 
the hold-up time, as shown in Figure 3. In order to have high 
efficiency within wide DC-bus voltage range, the design 
criteria are proposed in this paper with the considerations of 
the load matching for optimal efficiency, the voltage gain and 
input power factor for the LLC resonant tank.

calculated as 24.3n F. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Based on the specifications and parameters, listed in Table 
II and III, respectively, the prototype circuit of a full-bridge 
LLC resonant converter is built to verify the above design 
criteria. In order to ensure that the MOSFETs of the LLC 
DC-DC resonant converter achieve ZVS condition during the 
turn-on transition, the PLL control scheme is utilized [10].

full-bridge bottom MOSFETs for the prototype circuit with 
DC-bus voltages of 300V and 400V, respectively, at full-load. 
These experimental waveforms show that the MOSFETs 
achieve ZVS condition in the turn-on transition. Additionally,

voltage VAB and input current ILr for the LLC resonant tank 
with DC-bus voltage of 300V. These experimental 
waveforms shows that the phase difference is 36°, and then 
the input power factor of the resonant tank is 0.81,which 
approximates the previous design, as shown in Figure 8(a). 
Furthermore, Figure 12 illustrates the measured efficiencies 
with different DC-bus voltages at different load conditions. 
With DC-bus voltages of 300V and 400V, the measured full-

Abstract- This paper presents a non-inverting buck-boost 
based power-factor-correction (PFC) converter operating in the 
boundary-conduction-mode (BCM) for the wide input-voltage-
range applications. Unlike other conventional PFC converters, 
the proposed non-inverting buck-boost based PFC converter has 
both step-up and step-down conversion functionalities to provide 
positive DC output-voltage. In order to reduce the turn-on 
switching-loss in high frequency applications, the BCM current 
control is employed to achieve zero current turn-on for the 
power switches. Besides, the relationships of the power factor 
versus the voltage conversion ratio between the BCM boost PFC 
converter and the proposed BCM non-inverting buck-boost PFC 
converter are also provided. Finally, the 70-watt prototype 
circuit of the proposed BCM buck-boost based PFC converter is 
built for the verification of the high frequency and wide input-
voltage-range. 
Key words: power-factor-correction (PFC), boundary-
conduction-mode (BCM), boost converter, buck-boost converter. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Currently, in order to reduce the input-current harmonic 
distortion to fulfill the IEC 61000-3-2 Class-D Standard [1], 
the power-factor-correction (PFC) converters are widely used 
for the power converter systems. The boost converter, as 
shown in Fig. 1, is widely applied to PFC applications with 
the only step-up voltage conversion functionality [2, 3]. In 
general, the boost converter operates in the discontinuous-
conduction-mode (DCM) and boundary-conduction-mode 
(BCM) current control to have lower turn-on switching loss 
on the switch rather than the continuous-conduction-mode 
(CCM) one [4]-[8]. 
A. Conventional DCM Boost PFC Converter 
However, in the wide input-voltage-range PFC applications, 
the capability of both step-up and step-down voltage 
conversion functionality is required. The curve of the power 
factor versus the voltage conversion ratio α for the DCM 
boost converter is provided in [9], as shown in Fig. 2. α is the 
ratio of the maximum input voltage Vm to the output voltage 
Vo.With α=0.96 on this curve for PF>0.8, the DCM boost 
converter with high input line-voltage at 264Vrms provides 
output voltage more than 390V, which causes the high 
voltage stresses and cost of the components for the boost PFC 
converter and the following DC-DC converter stage. 
 
B. Wide Input-Voltage-Range PFC Converters 
With the same input power condition, the BCM PFC 
converter has the lower peak input current, as compared with 
the DCM PFC converter. Therefore, the BCM current control 
is widely adopted for the PFC applications. The BCM flyback 
based PFC converter with wider voltage-conversion range is 
presented in [10]. However, the isolated transformer and 
additional snubber circuit cause the more volume and power 
loss for the flyback converter. Therefore, the non-inverting 
buck-boost  based PFC converter with BCM current control is 
utilized to achieve high efficiency and power factor in this 
paper.

converter [7]. 
 
II. PROPOSED BCM NON-INVERTING BUCK-BOOST 
BASED PFC CONVERTER 
The non-inverting buck-boost based PFC converter, as 
shown in Fig. 3, is the combination of a buck converter and a 
boost converter. Based on the operation of the switches, this 
converter has two operational modes to provide both step-up 
and step-down voltage conversion functionality including the 
buck+boost, buck-boost modes [11]-[14]. Figures 4 (a) and 5 
show the gate signals of switches for these two modes, 
respectively.

conversion ratio α between the boost PFC converter and the 
proposed non-inverting buck-boost PFC converter both with 
BCM will be provide. 
A. BCM Boost PFC converter 
In a BCM boost PFC converter, as shown in Fig. 8, the on-
time is constant over an ac line cycle. Where T is the period 
of a switching cycle, and α is the ratio of the maximum input 
voltage Vm to the output voltage Vo. From the key waveforms, 
as shown in Fig. 9, the input line-current iin(t) in a switching 
period is given as follows:

Equations (3), the PF and total-harmonic-distortion (THDi)

Therefore, the PF and THDi curves of BCM boost PFC 
converter are plotted with different voltage conversion ratios 
α, as shown in Figures 11 and 12 respectively. As like the 
DCM boost PFC converter, the power factor and THDi are 
limited by the voltage conversion ratio α for the BCM boost 
PFC converter.

a switching period is given as follows:

synchronous and the measured switching frequency fsw is 
about 56 kHz. Besides, the inductor current is negative and 
flows through the body-diodes of the switches after the gate 
signals Vgs,1, Vgs,2 are on, which allows switches, S1 and S2, to 
achieve zero current turn-on condition.

Abstract- This paper presents the positive feed-forward control 
(PFFC) scheme for the distributed buck conversion system with 
the multiple non-ideal voltage sources. Since the employed 
voltage sources are non-ideal, the output voltage level of the 
individual voltage source varies with the output current of the 
individual voltage source. Moreover, the employed voltage 
sources with the different electrical characteristics have 
different power ratings. With the use of the conventional 
negative-feedback control (NFBC) schemes, the maximum input 
power of the individual power module cannot be limited at the 
maximum output power rating of the corresponding voltage 
source. Therefore, the proposed PFFC scheme is used to ensure 
the maximum power harvesting function for the individual 
power module. Furthermore, the average current-mode control 
(ACMC) associated with PFFC is able to ensure the stability for 
the power converter. Finally, the experimental results show that 
the paralleled buck power module system achieves the 
maximum power harvesting function.  
Index Terms- Distributed buck conversion system, Average

I. INTRODUCTION 
Recent years, the DC distributed power system (DPS) 
with a single DC voltage source, as shown in Fig. 1, has been 
widely used in many industrial applications. It has several 
advantages over the centralized power system, which has 
high reliability, redundancy, standardization for design, and 
ease for maintenance [1]. Furthermore, the active current-
sharing control techniques [3-7] were developed to achieve 
the balanced current distributions among the paralleled power 
modules. Each current-balanced bus (CB_bus) is used to 
carry the current-balanced reference signal to power modules.

Although the ratability of the DPS is better than that of 
the conventional single DC-DC power-conversion system, the 
DC DPS completely fails when the single DC voltage source 
is shut down. The DC distributed power system with multiple 
DC voltage sources, as shown in Fig. 2, can be applied in 
solar energy generation, fuel-cell generation, wind power 
generation, and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.

Since the employed voltage sources are non-ideal, the 
voltage level of the individual voltage source varies with its 
output current. In addition, the individual voltage sources 
with the different electrical characteristics have different 
power ratings. If the required input power of the individual 
power module in the paralleled power module system is 
greater than the output power rating of the corresponding 
voltage source, the output power of the voltage source 
decreases correspondingly. 
 
II. PROPOSED POSITIVE FEED-FORWARD CONTROL FOR 
PARALLELED BUCK CONVERTER SYSTEM 
In order to allocate the output powers among the different 
voltage sources, the PFFC scheme is proposed for the 
distributed power system, as shown in Fig. 1.3. By using the 
proposed PFFC scheme, the maximum input power of the 
individual power module in the paralleled power module 
system is limited at a specified value.

The equivalent circuit of two input voltage sources in 
parallel is constructed, as shown in Fig. 7, where each non-
ideal voltage source can be constructed with an ideal voltage 
source and a resistor.

levels Vin1 and Vin2 decrease.

The input voltage sensing network in the proposed PFFC 
circuit is shown in Fig. 8. Since the TL-431 has an inherent 
reference voltage Vref_TL431 = 2.5 V [15], the TL-431 is able to 
function as a voltage-threshold detector on the input voltage 
source to enable the maximum power harvesting function or 
current-balance function for the power modules.

Since the PFFC scheme is used to adjust the input or 
output currents of the power modules, the input impedances 
of the power modules in the paralleled power module system 
are regulated by the corresponding PFFC loops, respectively. 
In order to increase the low-frequency gain of the input 
impedance of the individual power module, the PFFC-loop 
compensator, as shown in Fig. 9, is used to provides one 
integrator, one pole, and one zero.

Once the input voltage level of the individual power 
module decreases to a specified threshold value, the PFFC 
circuit begins to limit the output current of the corresponding 
power module. 
 
III. EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS 
Fig. 10 shows the paralleled buck converter system 
including the ACMC and the proposed inner-loop PFFC 
schemes. According to the Tables 1(a) and (b), the prototype 
circuit of the paralleled ACMC+PFFC buck converter system 
is built to verify the functionality of the proposed PFFC 
scheme.

From Figures 13(a) and (b), the prototype circuit (with 
interleaved control) works at different loads IO= 5A and IO= 
6A, respectively. The plots illustrate that the maximum 
average value of the current IO2 is limited at 1.88A and the 
duty-cycle d2 is limited at 0.69 by the PFFC circuit in the 
power module #2.

According to the experimental results, the measured 
curves of the prototype circuit are shown in Figures 14 to 18. 
Fig. 14 shows that the input voltage level Vin2 is limited at 
18.3V after the load current exceeds 4A. The curve VO-IO 
illustrates that the prototype circuit has good output-voltage 
regulation at different load conditions. From Fig. 15, the 
duty-cycle d2 is clamped at 0.69, and the duty-cycle d1 of the 
power module #1 remains at 0.53 at different load conditions. 
Referring to Figures 16 and 17, the maximum values of the 
output current IO2 and the input current Iin2 are limited at 
1.88A and 1.34A, respectively. Fig. 18 shows that the 
maximum input power of the power module #2 is limited at 
25W. Therefore, the maximum power harvesting function is 
achieved for the prototype circuit.

conduction-mode (CCM) voltage-source (VS) charge-pump (CP) 
power-factor-correction (PFC) self-oscillating full-bridge 
electronic ballast for fluorescent lamps. Unlike the conventional

self-oscillating full-bridge electronic ballast has advantages of 
high power factor and low cost. The circuit analysis and the 
theoretical design criteria for the proposed AC-side CCM VS-
CPPFC self-oscillating full-bridge electronic ballasts are 
presented. Finally, an 80W prototype circuit is built to validate 
the feasibility and performance of the proposed electronic 
ballast.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Comparing with the electromagnetic ballasts, the electronic 
ballasts for fluorescent lamps have the advantages of small 
size, light weight, less flicker and longer lifetime [1]. In order 
to meet the IEC 61000-3-2 Class C regulation for the input 
current harmonics of electronic ballasts, the power-factor-
correction (PFC) techniques were developed. 
The active PFC electronic ballasts can be categorized into 
two types: two-stage and single-stage. The boost converter is 
usually employed in the PFC stage of the two-stage active 
PFC electronic ballast [2]. The disadvantages of the two-
stage PFC electronic ballasts include more cost and complex 
control circuit. In order to reduce the cost and circuit volume 
of the electronic ballasts, many single-stage PFC electronic 
ballasts have been developed.  
In recent years, the charge-pump power-factor-correction 
(CP-PFC) electronic ballasts have been proposed [3]. The 
CP-PFC electronic ballasts contain the PFC circuit and the 
inverter with sharing a common switch. When the CP-PFC 
electronic ballasts operate in discontinue-conduction-mode 
(DCM), the switches have high conduction losses. Therefore, 
the continuous input current (CIC) CP-PFC electronic 
ballasts are used to reduce the conduction loss on the power 
switches [3]-[4]. 
The gate-drive circuit for the electronic ballast can be 
categorized into two types: self-oscillating and IC-controlled. 
Comparing with the IC-controlled, the self-oscillating 
electronic ballasts have the advantages of lower cost and 
simple control circuit [5]. 
In order to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional 
PFC electronic ballasts, the AC-side CCM VS-CP-PFC self-
oscillating full-bridge electronic ballast is proposed in this 
paper.

Figure 1 shows the conventional rectified-side CCM VS-

inverter, a CP capacitor Cin, a PFC inductor Lpfc and a diode 
Dy. The resonant tank includes a resonant capacitor Cp, a 
resonant inductor Ls, a DC-blocking capacitor Cs, and the 
lamp. The half-bridge inverter is composed of the switch S1 
and switch S2. The CP capacitor Cin, the PFC inductor Lpfc, 
the diode Dy, the switches S1 and S2 are utilized to achieve

Figure 2 shows the simulation waveforms of the 
conventional rectified-side CCM VS-CP-PFC electronic 
ballast. When switch S1 is turned on, the charge-pump 
capacitor is decreased instantaneously. Meanwhile, the inrush 
current discharged from the charge-pump capacitor flows 
through the switch S1 through the diode Dy. Therefore, the 
switch S1 has high turn-on switching loss. The conventional 
rectified-side CCM VS-CP-PFC electronic ballast is not

Mode 1 (t0~t1): 
According to the key waveforms shown in Figure 8, the 
voltage vm is clamped at the DC-bus voltage Vbus before t0. 
At t = t0, the switch S2 is turned on. Since the input current 
iLpfc begins to charge the bulk capacitor Cdc, the input current 
iLpfc decreases linearly. Meanwhile, the resonant inductor 
current iLx discharges the bulk capacitor Cdc through the 
clamping diode Dr1. Based on the volt-second balance of 
inductor, Equations (1) and (2) are obtained.

At t = t1, the resonant inductor current iLx decreases to zero. 
Then the clamping diode Dr1 is turned off. Meanwhile, the 
bulk capacitor Cdc begins to charge the CP capacitor Cin and 
the resonant inductor Lx. Therefore, the resonant inductor 
current iLx and the charge pump-capacitor voltage vcin 
increase linearly. Based on the volt-second balance of 
inductor and amp-second balance of capacitor, the resonant 
inductor current iLx(t) and the CP capacitor voltage vcin(t) can 
be expressed and shown in the following equations.

capacitor voltage vcin. Then, the level of voltage vm follows 
the CP capacitor voltage vcin. When the voltage level of vm 
reaches the DC-bus voltage Vbus at t3, the diode Dx1 conducts. 
Based on the volt-second balance of inductor and amp-

Abstract-This paper presents the continuous-conduction-mode 
charge-pump power-factor-correction (CCM CP-PFC) 
electronic ballast with DC-bus voltage stress reduction function. 
The CP-PFC techniques are widely applied to the electronic 
ballasts in order to achieve high power factor. However, the DC-
bus voltage at preheat or ignition mode is higher than that at 
steady-state operation, which causes high voltage stresses on the 
active and passive components. Therefore, the input notch filter 
for the CCM CP-PFC electronic ballast is proposed in order to 
reduce the DC-bus voltage stress at preheat and ignition modes. 
Furthermore, to achieve high power factor functionality, the 
design guidelines for the CCM voltage-source (VS) CP-PFC 
electronic ballast is presented. Finally, one prototype circuit of 
the CCM VS CP-PFC electronic ballast for one T5-54W 
fluorescent lamp is built to verify the performance of the PFC 
and the voltage-stress reduction capability of the DC-bus.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Electronic ballasts have been commonly used in the 
lighting industry because of their light weight and flicker-free 
[1-5]. Conventionally, the DC voltage for the electronic 
ballast is obtained with a rectified line voltage and is filtered 
by a bulk capacitor CDC. If the value of the bulk capacitor CDC 
is increased, the voltage-ripple on the DC-bus voltage vDC can 
be reduced, thus achieving low crest factor for longer lamp 
lifetime. However, the bulk capacitor’s greater value causes 
low power factor (PF) and high total harmonic distortion 
(THD), and consequently the IEC 61000-3-2 Class-C 
Standard cannot be satisfied. In order to achieve high PF and 
low THD, the power-factor-correction (PFC) circuits are 
required for the electronic ballasts.  
The two-stage PFC electronic ballast has been widely used 
in the lighting products. The PFC pre-regulator in the two-
stage electronic ballast is usually implemented with a boost 
AC-DC converter to achieve high PF, and it also provides 
constant DC voltage vDC for the half-bridge inverter. 
However, an additional PFC control IC is required, which 
causes a higher component count and cost. In order to reduce 
the component count for cost-effectiveness, the single-stage 
PFC electronic ballasts have been proposed in prior work [6-
10]. Among these, one of the single-stage electronic ballasts 
in [6] is the combination of a boost PFC circuit and half-
bridge inverter. The control scheme for the power switches 
can be implemented with one single pulse-width-modulation 
(PWM) control IC in order to save the additional PFC control 
IC. However, the discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) 
operation used for achieving high PF causes high current 
stresses and high conduction losses on the switches [11,12]. 
The charge-pump power-factor-correction (CP-PFC) 
technologies have also been presented in prior works [11-21]. 
The charge-pump capacitor Cin is utilized to achieve high PF. 
Moreover, in order to reduce the current stress on the power 
switches, the continuous input current (CIC) CP-PFC 
electronic ballasts have been proposed [11,18,19] for lower 
current stress on the power switches. Furthermore, based on 
the CIC CP-PFC electronic ballasts, the continuous-
conduction-mode voltage-source (CCM VS) CP-PFC 
electronic ballast was proposed in other work [20] according 
to the bridgeless concept, as illustrated in Figure 1. One 
bridge of the full-bridge rectifier can be saved, and thus the 
component count is reduced and a cost-effective solution is 
provided. 
 
Fig. 1.  CCM VS CP-PFC electronic ballast for fluorescent lamp [20]. 
 
In order to have longer lamp lifetime, the preheat function 
is required for fluorescent lamp [5,21,22]. However, when the 
CP-PFC electronic ballasts operate in preheat or ignition 
mode, the DC-bus voltage is higher than it is during steady-
state operation, and this increase causes high voltage stresses 
on the active and passive components [11,14]. 
In this paper, the analysis and design for the CCM VS CP-
PFC electronic ballast will be presented. Furthermore, the 
input notch filter for the CCM VS CP-PFC electronic ballast 
will be proposed to reduce the DC-bus voltage stress at 
preheat and ignition modes. Finally, a prototype circuit of 
CCM VS CP-PFC electronic ballast for one T5-54W 
fluorescent lamp will be built to verify the design criteria and 
the functionality of the DC-bus voltage reduction.

Since the switching frequency fs is much higher than the 
line-frequency, the inductor current iLpfc can be considered as 
a constant DC level in one switching cycle. Based on the 
derived equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6, the analysis of 
the CCM CP-PFC electronic ballast will be presented in 
Section B. 
 
B.        Analysis of CCM VS CP-PFC Electronic Ballast 
Figure 7 shows the key waveforms for the simplified 
equivalent circuit for the CCM VS CP-PFC electronic ballast 
over one switching cycle in the positive value of the input AC 
voltage vAC. The operational principle is described with two 
operating stages as follows: 
 
Stage 1 [t0~t2]: 
Before t0, the diode D1 conducts and the level of the node 
voltage vx is equal to VDC. When the level of the capacitor 
current iCin reaches that of PFC inductor current iLpfc at t0, the 
diode D1 turns off and the input current iLpfc begins to charge 
the charge-pump (CP) capacitor Cin. Meanwhile, the level of 
the node voltage vX begins to decrease. At t1, the CP capacitor 
Cin discharges to the DC-bus capacitor CDC. Until the voltage 
level of vX increases to VDC, the diode current iD1 begins to 
conduct and this stage ends. 
Based on the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6 and key 
waveforms shown in Figure 7, the state equations of the 
inductor current iLpfc and the node voltage vX in Stage 1 can 
be derived, as illustrated in Equations (2) and (3), 
respectively.

Stage-2 [t2~t4]: 
In this stage, the diode D1 conducts and the level of the 
node voltage vX is equal to VDC. The CP capacitor Cin 
operates as resonant capacitor with the capacitors Cf and Cb 
during this stage. At t3, the current iCin of the CP capacitor Cin 
increases. When the level of capacitor current iCin reaches to 
that of the PFC inductor current iLpfc at t4, the diode D1 is 
turned off and one switching cycle finishes. According to the 
equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6 and key waveforms 
shown in Figure 7, the state equations for the inductor current 
iLpfc and the node voltage vX in Stage 2 can be derived, as 
illustrated in Equations (8) and (9), respectively.

which results in high PF. Referring to Figure 8, however, a 
high value of the CP capacitor Cin causes high DC-bus 
voltage stress. Therefore, in order to achieve high PF and 
ensure low DC-bus voltage stress, the value of the CP 
capacitor is selected as 12nF.

Abstract--This paper presents a novel single-stage charge-pump 
(CP) power-factor-correction (PFC) electronic ballast for the 
MH lamps driven with the low-frequency square-wave current 
to avoid the acoustic-resonance problem. In order to achieve 
high power factor and meet the IEC regulation, the CPPFC 
technique is applied to the full-bridge inverter of the 
conventional electronic ballast. Based on the analyses of the 
operational modes for the proposed electronic ballast, the design 
criteria of the CP components for the proposed electronic 
ballast are presented. A prototype circuit for 35-W MH lamp is 
implemented to confirm the presented design criteria. 
 
Keywords: Charge-pump (CP), power-factor-correction (PFC), 
single-stage, metal halide lamp, electronic ballast. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the metal halide (MH) lamp has become an 
attractive lighting source because of its good color rendering, 
compact size, and high luminous efficiency [1-3]. However, 
the MH lamp has the phenomenon of acoustic resonance, 
which causes arc fluctuation, visible flicker, and damage of 
arc tube [4-7]. In order to avoid the acoustic-resonance 
problem, driving the MH lamp with low-frequency square 
waveform current is an excellent solution [7]. 
The block diagram of the conventional two-stage 
electronic ballast for the MH lamp is shown in Fig. 1 [8-10]. 
The first stage, a boost converter, is the power factor 
correction (PFC) stage, which is used to achieve high power 
factor and provide a constant DC bus voltage to the second 
stage. The second stage is a full-bridge inverter, which is 
utilized to adjust the lamp power and drive the MH lamp with 
the low-frequency square wave current.  
In order to simplify the conventional electronic ballasts 
and meet the power factor regulations, many single-stage 
charge-pump power factor correction (CPPFC) schemes for 
electronic ballasts have been studied and developed [11-15]. 
The voltage source (VS) CPPFC electronic ballast for 
fluorescent lamp and the equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 
2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively [15]. According to the 
designs for the parameters of the CP components Cin1, Cin2 
and Lr1 in [15], the input current can be shaped into 
sinusoidal waveform to meet the requirements of high power 
factor. 
In this paper, the CPPFC technique is applied to the full-
bridge inverter of the conventional electronic ballast for the 
single MH lamp. Comparing the conventional electronic 
ballast, the power switch and the control circuit of the PFC 
stage can be saved. Consequently, the developed single-stage 
electronic ballast has potentially cost-effective advantage.

II. PROPOSED ELECTRONIC BALLAST 
Fig. 3 shows the proposed single-stage CPPFC electronic 
ballast for the MH lamps. In the CPPFC network, the CP 
components LX, Cin1 and Cin2 are utilized to shape the line 
current into sinusoidal waveform to meet the requirements of 
IEC 61000-3-2 Class-C Standard. The resonant inductor Lr of 
the CPPFC network is used to reduce the current stress on the 
switches SH1 and SH2 and the diodes Dr1, Dr2, Dy1, and Dy2. In 
addition, the resonant inductor Lx is used to improve the 
input power factor of the electronic ballast. 
The key waveforms of the proposed electronic ballast are 
shown in Fig. 4, where the switches SH1 and SH2 of the full-
bridge inverter are operated with high-frequency pulse width 
modulation (PWM). In addition, the switches SL1 and SL2 of 
the full-bridge inverter are operated complementarily at low-
frequency with 50% duty ratio. With the operations of the 
full-bridge inverter and rectified line voltage, the operational

Mode-8 [t7 ~ t8]: Since the voltage level of the capacitor Cin1 
is higher than the lamp voltage Vlamp, the CP capacitor Cin1 
discharges to the CO-Rlamp-L1-Lr network. Therefore, the 
voltage VCin1 decreases and the inductors currents iL1 and iLr 
increase. When the voltage VCin1 reaches the rectified line 
voltage |VAC| at t8, the diode DX conducts. 
Mode-9 [t8 ~ t9]: The CP capacitor Cin1 discharges to the CO-
Rlamp-L1-Lr network. Besides, the inductor LX and capacitors 
Cin1, Cin2 are charged by the line input current while the 
voltage level across the capacitors Cin1, Cin2 is lower than 
rectifier line voltage |VAC|. The capacitor Cin1 is charged by 
the difference current between the inductor currents iL1 and 
iX until the voltage vCin1 reaches zero at t9. 
Mode-10 [t9 ~ t10]: The inductors Lr and L1 discharge to the 
resistor Rlamp and capacitor CO. The inductor currents iL1 and 
iLr decreases linearly. The capacitor Cin2 is charged by the 
inductor current iX until the inductor current iX reaches zero at 
t10. 
Mode-11 [t10 ~ t11]: The inductors Lr and L1 discharge to the 
capacitor CO and resistor Rlamp. When the inductor currents iL1 
and iLr reach zero at t11, the switch SH2 is turned on and the 
next high-frequency switching cycle begins.

IV. DESIGN GUIDELINES 
In order to simplify the derivation for the expression of the 
line current, the following assumptions are made: 
¾ Steady-state operation and constant DC bus voltage, 
¾ switches and diodes are ideal components, 
¾ values of CP capacitors Cin1 and Cin2 are specified the 
same, 
¾ resonant inductor Lr is neglected, 
¾ iL1 during Mode-9 in Interval-Ⅱ are assumed as a 
constant current source. 
The equivalent circuits to represent the conducting paths of 
the inductor current iX are shown in Fig. 10. And Fig. 11 
shows the key waveforms of the equivalent circuits to 
represent the conducting paths of the inductor current iX.

The specifications for the proposed electronic ballast are 
listed in Table 1.Plotted from Equation (11), Fig. 12 shows 
the relationship between the values of the CP capacitors Cin1, 
Cin2 and the DC-bus voltage Vbus with different values of 
inductor LX. Fig. 12 shows that the DC-bus voltage Vbus 
increases as the values of the CP capacitors Cin1 and Cin2 
increase.  
Plotted from Equation (13), Fig. 13 shows the relationship 
between the value of inductor LX versus the value of CP 
capacitors Cin1 and Cin2 with different value for factor Ke. 
According to Fig. 13, the value of inductor LX increases as 
the values of the CP capacitors Cin1 and Cin2 increase. 
By applying η=0.8, Vbus=380V, Ke=5, iL1(tc3)=0.796 A, 
and the specifications in Table 1 to Equations (11) and (13), 
the value of the CP capacitors Cin1, Cin2 and the value of the 
inductor LX can be calculated as 4.37nF and 312μH, 
respectively.
