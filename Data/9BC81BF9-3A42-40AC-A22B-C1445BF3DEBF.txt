photocurrent response and second harmonic generation 
all yielded dissimilar results for two differently 
oriented PM chips, demonstrating the possibility of 
maneuvering PM immobilization orientations. 
Therefore, with the fabrication process and 
fabrication-monitoring methods developed in this 
study, we can continue to improve and optimize the 
coating process of PM photoelectric chips in the 
future.

consisting of several spectrally distinct inter- 
mediates. The exceptional photochromic, photo- 
electric, photo-induced proton transport, and 
nonlinear optical properties of bR render it a 
potential green photonic material for a wide 
variety of applications [1]. Furthermore, due to 
its high chemical and thermal stabilities, bR is 
considered one of the most promising nanobio- 
materials. 
Due to the fact that the proton pump of bR is 
unidirectional across PM from the cytoplasmic 
(CP) toward the extracellular (EC) sides, a high 
orientation-degree of PM layers fabricated on 
devices is decidedly demanded to avoid the 
cancellation of photoelectric effects arising from 
opposite light-induced proton fluxes generated 
by counter-oriented PM layers. Among several 
ways to directionally immobilize PM onto 
substrates, the electrophoretic sedimentation 
technique has been acclaimed as the most 
convenient and effective and consequently the 
most widely used one. However, it still suffers 
the drawbacks of high PM-consumption and 
poor stability of the deposited PM films in 
aqueous electrolytes. 
Herein, a robust layer-by-layer fabrication of 
highly oriented PM patches on ITO, which 
combined self-assembled monolayer (SAM), 
bioaffinity interaction, covalent linkages, and 
selective chemical modification, was developed 
to prepare PM-based photoelectric chips. SAM- 
fabricated ITO glass was first coated with avidin 
and then used to affinity-immobilize PM patches 
which had been conjugated with biotin at their 
either CP or EC sides (Fig. 1). Furthermore, 
AFM, XPS, cyclic voltammetry, contact angle, 
nanoparticles light scattering, photoelectric res- 
ponse, and second harmonic generation analyses 
were employed to monitor the layer-by-layer 
coating process. The results demonstrated the 
feasibility of the proposed fabrication scheme as 
well as the fabrication-monitoring methods. 
 
II. 實驗方法 
2.1 Materials 
PM was produced and purified in this 
laboratory following the standard procedures. 
Papain and biotin derivatives were purchased 
from Sigma and Pierce, respectively. Avidin 
was obtained from Invitrogen. 
 
2.2 PM biotinylation 
To prepare PM conjugated with biotin at 
the EC side, named biotin(EC)-PM, undigested 
PM was reacted with an EC-active biotin 
derivative, followed by dialysis or centrifuga- 
tion wash. To prepare PM conjugated with 
biotin at the CP side, named biotin(CP)-PM, 
PM was first digested with papain, then reacted 
with another CP-active biotin derivative, and 
finally centrifugation-washed.    
 
2.3 PM immobilization 
ITO glass or glass slides were first 
amine-functionalized with amine-terminated 
short-chained SAM molecules, then coated with 
avidin and biotinylated PM in sequence. The 
PM-coating area was 0.25 cm2. 
 
2.4 Measurements 
The equipment set up to measure photo- 
currents of PM-coated chips is shown in Fig. 2. 
A platinum wire and a solution of 10 mM KCl 
at pH 8.5 were used as the counter electrode 
and the electrolyte, respectively. The chip was 
illuminated with a Xenon arc lamp at 140 W 
equipped with a green-light filter and the 
photoelectric signals were retrieved with a 
current amplifier connected with an oscillo- 
 4
further increased on the avidin layer, and finally 
decreased after PM layering. 
To verify the directional immobilization 
of each biotinylated-PM, avidin-conjugated 
gold nanoparticles were managed to attach on 
PM-coated glass and detected by light 
scattering analysis. As shown in Figs. 8A-D, 
after modification with the EC-active biotin 
derivative, the biotin(CP)-PM coated glass was 
able to capture avidin-conjugated nanogolds 
and be detected, suggesting that the PM was 
coated with its CP side facing glass. The 
analysis with the biotin(EC)-PM coated glass 
exhibited stronger scattered intensities after 
silver enhancement (Figs. 8a-d) than the other 
PM-coated glass because there are more 
residues accessible to the CP-active biotin 
derivative on the CP side than the ones to the 
EC-active derivative on the EC side. 
 
3.2 Characteristics of PM-coated ITO 
The photocurrent responses of both 
differently coated PM ITO were distinctly from 
each other, as shown in Fig. 9. The chip coated 
with biotin(CP)-PM exhibited a response with 
reverse polarity and slower decay as compared 
to the one coated with biotin(EC)-PM. In 
addition, another separate study by using 
thick-gel PM ITO chips, which were prepared by 
drop-casting PM onto ITO without constraining 
its orientation, suggested that papain digestion 
could also affect both the photocurrent polarity 
and intensity of PM. Therefore, the reason 
causing the polarity changes of the photocurrent 
responses of the two different monolayer-coated 
PM chips prepared in this study still cannot be 
conclusively determined. As for the difference in 
the decay rates of both responses, a theoretic 
model simulating the electric circuits of the 
photocurrent-measuring system is needed. 
Therefore, more intensive studies to investigate 
the photocurrent-production mechanisms of both 
differently prepared chips are strongly suggested 
in the future. 
In addition, the effects of electrolyte pHs 
on the photoelectric behavior of both prepared 
native PM chips were investigated. There are a 
maximum of total photocurrents at pH 8.5 and a 
reversal of the current polarity between pH 5.5 
and 6.5 for the chips coated with biotin(EC)-PM 
(Fig. 10a), while the maximum and polarity 
reversal of total photocurrents of the other chips 
coated with biotin(CP)-PM occurred at pH 7.5 
and between pH 9.5 and 10, respectively (Fig. 
10b). Further investigation indicated that the 
photocurrent reversal of the latter chips under 
extremely alkaline conditions arose from the 
intrinsic characteristics of ITO. In addition, 
asymmetry of peak photocurrents, i.e. inequality 
of the absolute values of light-on and light-off 
photocurrents, was observed at all responses of 
the latter chips and sometimes at extreme 
conditions for the former ones (Fig. 10). Those 
observations also provide us valuable informa- 
tion for future studies on the photoelectric 
mechanisms of the prepared chips. 
Finally, the SHG capabilities of glass 
slides coated with monolayers of either 
biotinylated PM were examined. As shown in 
Table 1, the bare glass slide exhibited no SHG 
capability, while the signals arose after it was 
coated with avidin as well as with PM. Due to 
the fact that the second-order nonlinear optical 
effects are only allowed in noncentrosymmetric 
structures, proteins, which generally comprise 
different amino acids, are considered to be SHG 
materials. Regarding their tertiary structures, 
PM is much more noncentrosymmetric than 
avidin, because PM is a plain film composed of 
two dimensional lattices of bR trimers and

Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a light-driven unidirectional proton-pump protein embedded in the 
purple membrane (PM) of Halobacterium salinarum with exceptionally attractive properties, 
including photochromism, photoelectricity, photo-induced proton transport, and nonlinear optics. It 
resides in PM in a trimeric form and as a stable two-dimensional crystalline lattice structure, which 
offers the molecule advantages of easy manipulation and good sustainability at extreme pH and 
temperature conditions. Therefore, PM has recently been considered as a potential green photonic 
material for a wide range of applications. 
The PM samples previously used for application or characteristic studies were mainly dry thin 
films or aqueous suspensions. In this study, a hybrid-crystal form of PM lightly doped in an achiral 
amino acid, -alanine, was first prepared and characterized. The pure non-doped crystals grew as 
truncated rhombic bipyramids with the large angles around 120.5 ± 6.1°, wherein the zwitterion 
molecules adopted a gauche conformation about the C(2)–C(3) bond and were held together in a stable 
layer structure by hydrogen bonds. The light doping of PM caused no significant distortion of crystal 
shapes. Nevertheless, successful PM incorporation was evidenced by distinctive color changes of 
crystals from transparent crystal-clear colorlessness to translucent purple after the doping, presumably 
due to the structure similarity between PM patches and -alanine crystal plates. The single-crystal 
X-ray diffraction study as well as the powder X-ray diffraction and FTIR analyses revealed only the 
-alanine structure for both crystals because of extremely low PM incorporation levels. 
The crystalline macrostructure difference between those two crystals was manifested by further 
TGA/DTA and SAXS studies. In the TGA/DTA thermal analysis, the doped crystal started losing 
significant weight at a 5.5 °C lower temperature but reached the last two onset stages at higher 
temperatures than the pure one, suggesting macrostructural disturbance and delayed thermal 
decomposition of crystal caused by PM doping. The SAXS study revealed that increasing PM doping 
concentrations led to augmentation of the scattering light intensity at around 15-17 nm lattice spacing 
as well as of the spark intensity appeared at the east-northeastern corner of the diffuse ring in the 
two-dimensional SAXS pattern of the crystals, suggesting a preferential orientation for PM doping. 
BR possesses high hyperpolarizability due to the retinal chromophore bound to its Lys216 
residue. The nonlinear optical properties of both crystals were investigated by measuring their SH 
intensities after irradiation by a 1064-nm, 10-Hz Q-switched Nd:YAG ns-pulsed laser beam. Distinct 
upsurges of SHG efficiencies were observed in the PM-doped crystals rather than in the pure ones, 
with values varying with the irradiation surfaces, crystal orientations, and probe-polarization 
directions. Moreover, a much stronger dependence of SHG efficiencies on the incident angles of the 
irradiation light was observed in the doped crystal than in the pure one, confirming the arranged 
orientation of doping PM. Finally, the current-voltage recording showed the doped crystal had a 
stronger and much more illumination-dependent photoelectric property than the pure one. In summary, 
this study demonstrated the feasibility of tuning the photoelectric and nonlinear optical properties of 
organic crystals by PM doping.
