分波多工網路上具存活性虛擬拓樸重新調整之問題考慮具存活性虛擬

組態動作後能夠降低虛擬拓樸之目標函數值，該目標函數值為平均權重延遲。

有限的情況下，CRHA 的改善效果會較 PRHA 來的好；反之，則 PRHA 會有

1.導論 
由於網際網路的興起使得現今的網路使用日趨普及，加上
網際網路的應用不斷推陳出新，使得各種多媒體的傳輸需求日
益增大。因此，對屬於骨幹網路的頻寬需求也就愈來愈受重
視，便促成了高密度分波多工網路（Wavelength-division 
Multiplexing， WDM）的發展。分波多工網路在同一條光纖
上能夠以數十個不同的波長通道（wavelength channel or 
wavelength）同時傳送訊號，而每個波長通道的傳輸容量為
10G/s。在發送器與接收器之間將雷射光以不同的波長
（wavelengths）同時在光纖中進行資料傳遞，而這些不同波長
的光訊號在傳遞時彼此之間並不會互相干擾。發送器與接收器
間會經過許多的中間節點，每個中間節點均是由光交錯連接
（Optical Cross Connect，OXC）節點所組成，可以快速地將
訊號切換傳送到所要到達的節點[1]。 
給定一個 WDM 的實體虛擬拓樸（physical topology,，
PT），在兩個節點之間發送器與接收器之對應即稱為一個光徑
（lightpath），亦即，光徑為一條從傳送端到接受端的 WDM 通
道。許多的光徑便可組合構成虛擬拓樸（virtual topology， 
VT）。在設計光徑時，若 WDM 網路的節點不具有波長轉換
（wavelength conversion）的功能時，需要滿足波長連續性限
制（wavelength continuity constraint），也就是該光徑從發送器
到接收器所經過的光纖鏈結中都要使用相同的波長。而且，不
同的光徑，若有經過相同的光纖鏈結，則此兩個光徑須指派不
同的波長。但若是傳遞路徑當中某個節點具有波長轉換
（wavelength conversion）的功能，那麼就可以進行波長轉換。 
實體拓樸（PT）為光纖網路的實際 OXC 節點的配置與節
點間光纖鏈結組合，可以用一個圖（graph）來表示。實體拓
樸上若兩節點（node）間存在著鏈結（link），則表示在該節點
之間有配置光纖鏈結，一般而言，我會假設實體拓樸為一個連
通圖（connected graph）。而邏輯拓樸（logical topology）也可
稱為虛擬拓樸（virtual topology, VT）則是光徑的集合，也可
以用一個圖表示。在虛擬拓樸中，每一個鏈結表示兩節點間存
在著光徑。實體拓樸與虛擬拓樸的節點相同，鏈結也存在著對
應的關係，每一個虛擬拓樸的鏈結（或光徑）代表在實體網路
上光訊號實際經過的節點與光纖的集合。 
隨著分波多工技術廣泛的使用，光學網路的傳輸容量大大
的提升。但由於同時傳送較多的資料，當網路上有故障發生時
（此故障包含節點及鏈路的失效），如果因處理的延誤將造成
大量資料的流失。所以必須有一個快速的故障保護與恢復機
制，當故障發生時能夠快速的轉換傳送路徑，使得資料得以繼
續傳輸。在網路傳輸時障礙發生的處理方式中，相關的管理機
制已經被提出 [3]，主要包含在主要頻寬中預留備用頻寬的保
護（protection）機制及故障發生時尋找可用替代傳輸路徑的恢
復（restoration）機制 [3]。 
恢復機制(restoration)是當故障發生時才開始找尋恢復的
路徑，尋找一條可以到達目的節點的可用路徑。恢復機制的特
點如下： 
（1）耗時（Time-consuming）：恢復機制由於牽涉到重新計
算及建立網路的繞行路由表（Routing table），一般需要較
多的時間來完成。 
（2）恢復機制運作較為複雜，其需要複雜的數學運算，才能
得到最佳的頻寬利用率。 
（3）恢復機制較為依賴動態的資料繞行（Dynamic Routing）
機制，需根據故障發生當時的流量情形而進行動態調整。 
（4）恢復機制運作時，需要收集與利用到較大範圍的網路拓
樸上許多節點的資訊。 
（5）可以提供較彈性的保護，可以保護故障發生時，緊接而
來發生的第二個甚至第三個的故障問題。 
（6）頻寬利用較有效率。 
 
保護機制(protection)中，兩點之間的傳送必須有一組主要
路徑及備用路徑，在網路正常情況下，利用主要路徑來傳輸，
當鏈路發生中斷導致主要路徑失效時，則立刻將主要路徑上的
訊務全部轉換到備用路徑上來傳輸。保護機制的特點如下： 
（1）快速：保護切換一般皆在非常短的時間內完成。

分波多工網路上具存活性虛擬拓樸重新調整問題：考慮具
存活性虛擬拓樸在有限轉換次數限制下如何獲得最佳的新的
虛擬拓樸。假設實體拓樸、現有的虛擬拓樸與新的交通流量為

平均權重延遲。 
由於當重新調整的次數(r) 較大時，要在多項式時間內找

料量成指數分配。 故本計劃中提出啟發式演算法、基因演算
法與模擬退火演算法等方法來解決此問題。  
  
3.1 啟發式演算法(heuristic algorithm) 
大致上整個演算法可以分成三個部份：前置處理
（preprocessing）、直接調整（direct adjustment）與間接調整
（indirect adjustment），在一開始將 i（節點對之編號）的初始
值設為 1，當 r 值大於 0 且 i 值小於 CR（該網路上所有節點對
的總個數）時將持續進行調整動作。針對每一個節點對，在一
開始會先判斷該節點對之剩餘收發器是否足夠進行直接調
整，若該節點對之剩餘收發器不足以進行直接調整，則該節點
對將進入間接調整階段。在直接調整及間接調整的過程當中，
若順利完成調整動作則更新 r 值並將 i 值加 1；反之，則僅將 i
值加 1。在前置處理主要為透過已知資訊來建立波長使用表
（wavelength usage table, WUT）、針對每一傳輸需求尋找出鏈
路不重疊之最短路徑對；而直接調整階段則是藉由前置處理所
獲得的資訊來作進一步的判別、建立光路徑。若當下的網路剩

計間接調整時以下兩點問題將是我們必須去克服的：（1）如何
避免破壞虛擬拓樸的連通性、（2）如何更有效率地運用有限的
r值。為了能夠找到與既有光路徑存在著最少衝突的路徑對來進
行新增，所以演算法的主要想法為事先求得(s, d)節點對之間的
k條繞送路徑以便增加路徑選擇上的彈性，之後再從中挑選出
不會破壞虛擬拓樸連通性且具有最少衝突的路徑對。 
在尋找k條鏈路不重疊路徑的程序當中，將藉由KSP去尋
找出k條候選繞送路徑。在求得數條候選繞送路徑之後，再去
做進一步的路徑篩選，以期許該新繞送路徑對在建立的過程能
與既有的虛擬拓樸發生最少的衝突。當衝突的個數越少，即表
我們可以更有效率地去使用有限的r次調整階段，而為了能挑選
出衝突個數最少的繞送路徑對，在此便提出了Least Conflict

algorithm）來解決問題。基因演算法已經被證明適用於最佳化
問題的求解。利用基因演算法，我們期望可以找到近似最佳化
的解。 
基因演算法的設計可以分成以下幾個部份：(1)染色體編

1 Introduction
There is a growing consensus that the next generation Internet will employ an IP-over-WDM
architecture [1]. In this architecture, IP routers are attached to the optical cross-connects (OXCs)
and IP links are realized by lightpaths. A virtual topology (VT) consists of a set of lightpaths in an
optical network. The virtual topology design (VTD) problem is an important problem in WDM
networks. Given the traffic demand and the physical topology, the goal of the VTD problem is to
design a virtual topology with some resources constraints (e.g., links, wavelengths, transceivers,
etc) so that the objective cost can be minimized [2, 3].
Independence between virtual topology and physical network is an important characteristic
of WDM networks. When the traffic pattern changes, the virtual topology reconfiguration (VTR)
becomes a significant topic. The main idea of VTR is to reconfigure the current virtual topology
to get a better VT instead of re-designing a whole new one. In contrast with the re-designing
approach, VTR can find a virtual topology quickly to meet the goal pattern [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] within constraints.
In WDM networks, a wavelength channel has a transmission rate greater than gigabits per
second. If the fiber links fail, a lot of connection streams will be dropped. So survivability is im-
portant in IP-over-WDM networks. Many protection and restoration schemes have been proposed
to achieve survivability in the optical layer [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Protection strategies
can be further classified as dedicated protection, shared-link protection, shared-path protection, and
shared sub-path protection. Because dedicated protection has better performance and efficiency
than shared protection, most of the existing topologies use the dedicated protection design. In
dedicated protection, for each connection, there is a pair of edge-disjoint (primary and a backup)
lightpaths [17, 18]. Survivable WDM network design problems are mostly formulated as integer
linear programs (ILP) and are identified as NP-hard to solve.
In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem (VTRP) in survivable WDM net-
works with a reconfiguration constraint is studied. The formulation and definition of the VTRP
of WDM networks were studied in [25, 26]. Given the WDM network, an existing dedicated
path-protection virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal is to reconfigure the
2
was formulated with new variables and constraints by a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). In
[14], a distributed algorithm for virtual topology reconfiguration in the event of traffic changes in
IP-Over-WDM networks was proposed.
In [15], an iterative local search algorithm was proposed to track rapid changes in traffic
pattern for virtual topology reconfiguration and load balance. In [27], the virtual topology design
problem was formulated and three objective functions were proposed for finding the optimal virtual
topology for a given traffic pattern. Tradeoffs between the amount of reconfiguration steps and
optimization of the proposed objective function were considered. In [28], the best virtual topology
for a given network traffic-matrix was calculated by ILP formulations. This methodology was
based on both optimizing a given objective function and minimizing the changes required to
obtain new virtual topology from the current virtual topology. The closest virtual topology was
chosen for reconfiguration but the reconfiguration procedure was not considered. In [27, 28], the
best virtual topology for a given network traffic using MILP formulation and heuristic techniques
were shown. In [29] three reconfiguration schemes were proposed that attempt to shift from one
virtual topology to another while keeping the network availability as high as possible. Proposed
reconfiguration algorithms can arrange a reconfiguration sequence to minimize the mean number
of disrupted transceivers.
2.2 Reconfiguration with Survivability
Two studies have discussed the issue which combines survivability and reconfiguration. In [30],
the authors studied the VTRP of survivable MPLS/WDM networks by using the existing shared
protection backup resource. A novel group-based mechanism was proposed. With this mechanism,
lightpaths are divided into groups and those in the same group can be reconfigured simultaneously
at one step and no service disruption may incur during the reconfiguration process. The goal is to
find the optimal reconfiguration policy (or sequence) which minimizes the reconfiguration steps.
Lee et al [31] considered the survivable reconfiguration problem on a WDM ring. In their study,
given a logical topology with its survivable embedding over a physical ring network and a new
virtual topology to be reconfigured, the goal is to find a sequence of lightpaths adding and deletions
which satisfy the given wavelengths and ports constraints such that the virtual topology remains
4
P ∩B = ∅, and P ∪B = E ′. The minimal propagation delay between nodes vs and vd on virtual
topology G′(V, P, wei) and G′(V,B,wei) are denoted as dPsd and d
B
sd, respectively. Let TXi and
RXi represent the number of transmitters and receivers of node vi, respectively.
3.2 Assumptions
In this paper, the physical topology, existing virtual topology, new traffic demand, and the re-
configuration constraint (RC, a positive integer) are known in advance. Moreover, we assume
that:
• For each edge in the physical network, there is a single fiber connecting the end-nodes in
the WDM network, and the data can be transmitted bidirectional.
• For each node in the physical network there is no wavelength converting capability. All
lightpaths should satisfy the wavelength continuity constraint [2].
• Only the single fiber failure scenario is considered in this paper.
• The physical topology is two-connected, i.e., the single fiber failure does not disconnect the
physical network.
• The existing and final virtual topologies are connected.
• The transmitters and receivers are tunable. The number of transmitters and receivers are
fixed and known.
• The reconfiguration constraint is used to constrain the number of changes on bi-directional
lightpaths (including delete, add, or re-route).
3.3 Objective
The minimal hop distance between nodes vs and vd on virtual topology G
′(V, P, 1) and G′(V,B, 1)
are denoted as hPsd and h
B
sd, respectively. The average weighted hop-distance (AWHD) is defined
as
Have =
∑
∀vs,vd∈V Tsd × (hPsd + hBsd)∑
∀vs,vd∈V Tsd
. (1)

4.1 Preprocessing Stage
In the preprocessing stage, first, for the given current virtual topology, a wavelength usage ta-
ble (WUT) is constructed to store the information of wavelengths usage of all fibers in phys-
ical network. WUT can be implemented by a two-dimension array with size |E| × |W |. Let
WUT (eij, k) = 1, if the k
th wavelength of the fiber eij is used by a lightpath of virtual topology;
WUT (eij, k) = 0, otherwise.
Let Ds,d be the sum of the propagation delay of the primary and backup lightpaths between
nodes vs and vd on G(V,E
′, wei), that is, Ds,d is equal to dPsd + d
B
sd. For each pair of nodes
(vs, vd), vs, vd ∈ V , perform edge-disjoint shortest path algorithm (EDSPA) on physical topology
G(V,E, f) to find the minimal min-sum shortest edge-disjoint paths and let D∗s,d be the sum
of delay of the edge-disjoint paths of the pair of nodes (vs, vd), vs, vd ∈ V . Let ISs,d = Ts,d ×
(Ds,d − D∗s,d) denote the possible improvement for minimal weighted delay between the pair of
nodes (vs, vd), ∀vs, vd ∈ V . Then all pairs of nodes {(vs, vd), ∀(vs, vd) ∈ V × V } are sorted in the
descending order according to the value of ISs,d. The pair of nodes with the greatest value IS
is with priority to be selected for performing reconfiguration action. Without loss of generality,
assume the sequence of all pairs of nodes is listed in the set NP = {(s1, d1), (s2, d2), ..., (sCR, dCR)},
where CR = n× (n− 1)/2.
The details of the Preprocessing Stage is shown as follows:
Algorithm: Preprocessing
Step 1: Construct WUT according to the current virtual topology.
Step 2: For each pair of nodes (vs, vd), perform EDSPA to find the minimal min-sum edge-disjoint
shortest paths on G(V,E, f) and compute D∗s,d. For each pair of node (vs, vd), compute ISs,d =
Ds,d −D∗s,d.
Step 3: Sort node pairs (vs, vd), ∀(vs, vd) ∈ V ×V in the decreasing order according to the value of ISs,d.
The sequence of the set of node pairs is constructed as the setNP={(s1, d1), (s2, d2), ..., (sCR, dCR)},
where CR = n× (n− 1)/2.
4.2 Direct Adjustment Stage
After performing preprocessing stage, several pairs of nodes in the NP are to be selected one
by one and reconfigured. For the selected pair of nodes, two possible strategies are designed
8
The details of the EDPA are shown as follows:
Edge-Disjoint Path Algorithm(EDPA)
Input: physical topology G, virtual topology G′, the source node vs and the destination node vd in V
Output: two edge-disjoint paths or fail (when the resource is not sufficient)
Step 1: Construct the layered graph LG according to the current virtual topology G′.
Step 2: Perform Dijkstra Algorithm on LG to find the shortest routing path p1 from D′ to D′.
Step 3: If (path p1 is found)
{
Remove edges of the shortest path p1 (except for edges in Link) from wavelength graph
Gl(V,E, f),
l=1, 2, ..., w of layered graph LG.
Perform Dijkstra Algorithm on LG to find the shortest routing path p2 from s′ to d′.
If (p2 is found)
return p1 and p2.
else
return fail.}
else
return fail.
If performing the EDPA algorithm fails to find a pair of edge-disjoint paths on G, that is,
current virtual topology cannot be reconfigured by performing the Direct Adjustment, then the
Indirect Adjustment algorithm will be used to do the reconfiguration. If performing the EDPA
can find a pair of edge-disjoint paths between source and destination nodes on layered graph, this
means that the virtual topology can be adjusted if the remaining r is greater than rc, where rc
(rc=1 or 2) is the number of configuration actions needed for reconfiguring these two lightpaths.
After performing the Direct Adjustment, the value of r is decreased by rc. The details of the
Direct Adjustment are shown as follows:
Direct Adjustment (DA)
Input: si, di, r, [Tij ]n×n, G(V,E, f), G′(V,E′, wei)
Output: two edge-disjoint paths and the assigned wavelengths
Step 1: Perform EDPA on layered graph LG to find a pair of link-disjoint routing paths (p1, p2) from
si to di.
Step 2: If (fail to find paths) then
return fail;
else
compute the sum of delay of paths p1, p2 denoted as D(p1, p2) and rc.
Step 3: If (D(p1, p2) < Di) and (r > rc) then
{
Change the routing paths of node pair (si, di) to p1, p2, and subtract rc from r.
Update the layered graph LG, WUT and virtual topology.
return success.}
else
return fail.

of element Conflict[j, l] is used to store the number of occurred conflicts if lightpath pij in P
i
is assigned to wavelength l, j=1, 2, ..., k; l=1, 2, ..., w. Then, from all the possible feasible
paths, find two paths with smaller delay and conflicts, and when adding two paths into current
virtual topology and removing the conflict lightpaths, these actions will not disconnect the virtual
topology. The details of the LCPFA is described as follows:
Least Conflict Paths Finding Algorithm (LCPFA)
Input: si, di, P i = {pi1, pi2, ..., pik}, WUT , r, G(V,E′, wei)
Output: two edge-disjoint paths or fail
Step 1: Initial k × w matrix Conflict=[0]k×w.
Step 2: For each lightpath pij , j=1,2, ..., k and for each wavelength l=1, 2, ..., w, find the value of
Conflict[j, l] which represents the number of conflicts occurred if lightpath pij is assigned to
wavelength l, (j=1, 2, ..., k; l=1, 2, ..., w ).
Let CF (j, l) denote the set of lightpaths in current virtual topology which are conflict with path
pij , if path p
i
j were assigned to wavelength l.
For the following cases the Conflict(j, l) is changed to ∞.
Case 1: If removed paths in CF (j, l) and added path pij disconnected the virtual topology.
Case 2: If the propagation delay of path pij greater than the delay of current lightpath
(the delay of two nodes with no lightpath is assume to be infinity).
Case 3: If Conflict[j, l] greater than the current reconfiguration constraint r.
Step 3: Find a path in P i (say pix) with smallest value of (delay, CF (j, l)) (in lexicographical order)
and with and CF (j, l) <∞ and the assigned wavelength.
Step 4: If (pix found) then{
Remove pix from P
i, add pix into virtual topology.
Update Conflict matrix and re-perform Step 2 and 3 to find a path (say piy).
If (piy found) then
return (pix, p
i
y ) and rf (the sum of conflicts);
else
return fail.}
else
return fail.
4.4 Positive reconfiguration heuristic algorithm (PRHA)
In the PRHA, after performing preprocessing stage, nodes are selected according to the value of
IS. The pair of nodes with largest value is with the highest priority to be selected to perform
the reconfiguration action. For the selected pair of nodes, if there is a link in the current virtual
topology, then the information (including lightpaths and wavelengths) of this link is stored (for
restoration if need) and then the possessed resources are released. The Direct Adjustment is
performed if there are spare transceivers on the nodes of selected pair. If performing Direct
12
by performing the Direct Adjustment for all pairs of nodes. We change the timing for calling
Indirect Adjustment in PRHA and propose a new algorithm named as Conservative Reconfigura-
tion Heuristic Algorithm (CRHA). In CRHA, first, only Direct Adjustment is performed. After
checking all possible node pairs, if the number of remaining reconfiguration actions r is greater
than zero, the Indirect Adjustment is performed. To get more accurate result by performing the
Indirect Adjustment, the ISs,d values for all pair of nodes (vs, vd) are recomputed according to
the virtual topology after performing Direct Adjustment. The details of CRHA are described as
follows:
Conservative Reconfiguration Heuristic Algorithm (CRHA)
Step 1: Perform Preprocessing and set index i to 1.
Step 2: While (r > 0 and i ≤ CR)
{
if (Di == D∗i ) then
i++; // can’t be reduced
else{
if ((si, di) ∈ G′(V,E′, wei))
{
Backup the information of node pair (si, di) which includes the source node,
destination node, the routing path and assigned wavelength.
Release the resource of node pair (si, di).
}
if ( TXi ≥ 2 ∧RXi ≥ 2 )
{
Perform Direct Adjustment Algorithm for node pair (si, di).
}
i++;
}
}
Step 3: For each pair of node (s, d), compute ISs,d = Ds,d −D∗s,d.
Step 4: Sort node pairs (s, d) ∀(vs, vd) ∈ V × V in decreasing order according to the value of ISsd.
The new sequence of node pairs is {(s1, d1), (s2, d2), ..., (sCR, dCR)}, where CR = n× (n− 1)/2.
Set i to 1.
Step 6: While (r > 0 and i ≤ CR)
{
if (Di == D∗i ) then
i++; // can’t be reduced
else{
if ((si, di) ∈ G′(V,E′, wei))
{
Backup the information of node pair (si, di) which involves the source node,
destination node, the routing path and assigned wavelength.
Release the resource of node pair (si, di).
}
Perform Indirect Adjustment Algorithm for node pair (si, di).
i++;

different number of wavelengths (w), respectively. Observation from Fig. 7(a) shows that CRHA
can get better performance than PRHA. But in Fig. 7(b) PRHA can get better performance than
CRHA. Because the spare resource in N1 is less than N2, thus CRHA will have more chance to
reconfigure more node pairs. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the comparison of PRHA and CRHA on
networks N1 and N2 with different number of transceivers (TR), respectively. Observation from
these figures shows that CRHA can get better performance than PRHA when the TR = 18. But
in the cases TR = 10 PRHA can get better performance than CRHA.
Fig. 9 shows the CPU time in microsecond of PRHA, CRHA on network N2 with different
number of reconfiguration (r). CRHA can run faster than CRHA.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we studied the virtual topology reconfiguration problem (VTRP) onWDM networks.
A new problem model was defined which combines the survivability and reconfiguration. Given
the physical topology, dedicated path-protected virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix,
the goal is to reconfigure current virtual topology to generate a new one under the pre-specified
reconfiguration constraint (r, a positive integer) so as to minimize the objective value, which is the
average weighted propagation delay (AWPD). Because designing a polynomial time algorithm to
find the optimal solution of VTRP is impractical when the reconfiguration constraint RC is larger,
two heuristic algorithms are proposed here to solve it. They are Positive Reconfiguration Heuristic
Algorithm (PRHA) and Conservative Reconfiguration Heuristic Algorithm (CRHA). Experiment
results reveal that the objective value can be decreased effectively by using proposed heuristic
algorithms.

Abstract— In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration
Problem (VTRP) on survivable WDM networks with reconfigura-
tion constraint is studied. Given a physical topology, a dedicated
path-protected virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix,
the goal of VTRP is to reconfigure the current virtual topology
under the pre-specified reconfiguration constraint such that the
objective value can be minimized. The objective value considered
in this paper is the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD).
Because designing a polynomial time algorithm to find the
optimal solution of VTRP is impractical when the reconfiguration
constraint is larger. In this paper, a simulated annealing (SA)
and a genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed to solve this problem.
Experiment results of these algorithms are also given. 1

I. INTRODUCTION
There is a growing consensus that the next generation
Internet will employ an IP-over-WDM architecture [1]. In
this architecture, IP routers are attached to the optical cross-
connects (OXCs) and IP links are realized by lightpaths. IP
network topology and IP links are referred as virtual topology
(VT) and links, respectively. Given the traffic demand and the
physical topology, the goal of virtual topology design problem
is to design a virtual topology with some resources constraints
(e.g., links, wavelengths, transceivers, etc) so that the objective
cost can be minimized. When the traffic pattern changed, the
virtual topology reconfiguration problem (VTRP) became as a
significant topic. The goal of VTRP is to reconfigure current
VT to get a better one within constraints [2], [3].
Since a network failure (such as a fiber cut or node failure)
can cause tremendous data loss. Several schemes have been
proposed to achieve survivability in the optical layer [4].
Survivability can be achieved by protection or restoration. In
the edge-disjoint path protection strategy, each link is mapped
to working and backup lightpaths which are edge-disjoint [5]–
[7]. Protection strategies can be further classified as dedicated
and shared. In dedicated protection, backup lightpaths are
not allowed to share common capacity (wavelength channels),
while in shared protection, backup lightpaths can share com-
mon capacity if failures in their respective working lightpaths
are not expected to occur simultaneously [5], [6]. Survivable

of Taiwan, R. O. C. under Grant Number NSC-96-2221-E-018-007
WDM network design problems were mostly formulated as
integer linear programming (ILP) formulas which have been
proved as a NP-hard problem [5], [6].
Two studies have discussed the issue which combines
survivability and reconfiguration. In [8], the virtual topology
reconfiguration problem of survivable MPLS/WDM networks
by using the existing shared protection backup resource is
studied. The goal is to find the optimal reconfiguration policy
(or sequence) which minimizes the reconfiguration steps. In
[9], Lee et al considered the survivable reconfiguration prob-
lem on WDM ring.
In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem
(VTRP) on survivable WDM networks with reconfiguration
constraint is studied. Given a physical topology, a dedicated
path-protection virtual topology and a new traffic demand
matrix, the goal of VTRP is to reconfigure the current vir-
tual topology under the reconfiguration constraint so as to
minimize the objective value, which is the average weighted
propagation delay (AWPD). Because designing a polynomial
time algorithm to find the optimal solution of VTRP is
impractical when the reconfiguration constraint is large and
heuristic algorithms may trap into local optima. In this paper,
a simulated annealing (SA) [10] and a genetic algorithm (GA)
[11] are proposed to find a near optima solution of this
problem.
II. PROBLEM DEFINITION AND RELATED WORKS
A. Notations
Let G(V,E, f) represent the physical topology of WDM
network, where V = {vi|i = 1, 2, ..., n} is the set of
(OXC) nodes, E = {eij|vi, vj ∈ V } is the set of fibers,
eij be the fiber connects nodes vi and vj , f(eij) is the
propagation delay of the fiber e ij between nodes vi and vj .
G′(V,E′, wei) is the virtual topology of WDM network G,
where E ′ = {e′ij|vi, vj ∈ V } is the set of virtual links.
Virtual link e′ij represents the link between nodes vi and
vj . All links are bidirectional, i.e., e′ij = e′ji, for all vi,
vj ∈ V . For each link e′ij on virtual topology G′ there is a
lightpath on physical network G. Let pathi,j represent the set
of physical fibers passed by the lightpath e ′ij and wei(e′ij) be
the propagation delay between node v i and vj , i.e., wei(e′ij) =∑
exy∈pathij f(exy). Note that wei(e
′
ij) = wei(e
′
ji). Assume
there are w wavelengths on the network G. Tn×n = [Tij ]n×n,
is a symmetric traffic matrix, element Tij , i, j = 1, 2, ..., n,
of data (EN , AD, RP , WA) is constructed. The structure of
configuration used in SA for solving VTRP is shown in Fig 1.
The configuration can be represented by CONF= {conf i|
i =1, 2, ..., R}, where confi= {(ENpi , EN bi ) | (ADpi , ADbi )
| (RP pi , RP bi ) | (WApi ,WAbi )}. Together with the current
virtual topology, the configuration can be used to represent
the final virtual topology after performing reconfiguration.
Assume the number of reconfiguration actions of conf i is
denoted as ri, where ri ≥ 1. It is worth noting that ri
may be greater than 2, since the new paths and the assigned
wavelengths may conflict with more than two lightpaths.
Since the configuration constraint is RC, the total number of
configuration actions acted by the configuration CONF may
be greater than RC. If this case happen, a maximal integer
bound which satisfies
∑bound
j=1 rj ≤ r, is used to store the
position of configuration CONF , the remaining actions (with
index greater than bound) are ignored. The order of the actions
in the array CONF is also the order that acts on links of
virtual topology.
For a given CONF , a decoded algorithm DECODE is de-
veloped to find the final virtual topology acted by performing
actions in CONF and the objective value. The details of the
DECODE are shown in Fig. 2(a).
B. Initial Configuration Generation
From the observation in previous subsection, change the
content of EN does effect the contents of the AD, PR,
and WA. That is, once the acted link of virtual topology
is changed, the action acted on the paths, the corresponding
routes of (primary and backup) paths, and the assigned wave-
lengths should be updated according to the content of EN .
The similar situations are also applied to the changing content
of AD.
An algorithm Random Initialization is proposed to generate
he initial content of the configuration. After performing the
Random Initialization, the resulted virtual topology should be
a connected graph. First, select randomly a logical link and
the action type. Then the content of the PR is randomly
selected from the edge-disjoint path-table of the pair of nodes
(ENp, EN b). Final the assigned wavelengths are determined
by performing the First-Fit heuristic algorithm. This process
is repeated until the configuration is constructed. The details
of the Random Initialization are shown in Fig. 2(b).
C. Perturbation Mechanisms
Several types of perturbations are introduced to the SA
algorithm to generate the possible next configuration.
• P1 Addition-first perturbation (AFP): For a given
CONF , shift all link-addition actions ( (ADpi , ADbi ) =
(2, 2)) to the left of the CONF .
• P2 Path-reroute perturbation (PRP): First, randomly se-
lect an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) from a given configuration
whose value of (ADpi , ADbi ) is in {(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (3,3)
}. Second, for each lightpath whose value of correspond-
ing adjustment not equal to zero, random select a new
routing path (by random select an integer in [1, K]) in the
Fig. 2. (a) DECODE, (b) Random Initialization, (c) Simulated annealing
algorithm.
edge-disjoint path-table of the node pair (EN pi , EN bi ).
Note that the value is not equal to the number of another
path of the same link. Final, determine the assigned
wavelength of the new routing paths by performing the
First-Fit wavelengths assignment algorithm.
• P3 Action-change perturbation (ACP): First, randomly
select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) from a given configu-
ration. The value of AD is random changed to another
type of adjustment. If there is a link in original virtual
topology, then all actions can be selected except link-
addition action. If there is no link in original virtual
topology, only the link-addition action can be selected.
After determining the action of link, the routing paths can
be determined randomly and the assigned wavelengths
can be determined by performing the First-Fit method.
• P4 Link-addition perturbation (LAP): First, randomly
select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) from a given configuration
whose adjustment (ADpi , ADbi ) is in {(1,0), (0,1), (1,1),
(3,3) } and change the value of (ADpi , ADbi ) to (2, 2).
Random selected a pair of nodes not in current virtual
topology. Then, the routing paths can be determined
randomly and the assigned wavelengths are determined
by performing the First-Fit method.

Fig. 4. Comparison of SA and GA with different values of R and |E′|.
The relationship of objective cost and R for different values
of |E′| is shown in Fig. 4. Observations from Fig. 4 also
show that as the value of |E ′| increases, the objective cost
decreases. The result shows that genetic algorithm can obtain
better results than simulated annealing algorithm in most of
the test problems.
The average objective cost (AGA, ASA) and standard deriva-
tion (STDGA, STDSA) obtained by executing algorithms
SA and GA on network N are compared and shown in
Table I. In Table I, the ratio of average cost (A = ASA/AGA)
and standard derivation (STD = STDSA/STDGA) are also
given. Observe the result shown in Table I, it is easy to find that
GA can get better performance than SA on average objective
cost and standard derivation ratio. As seen in Table I, the ratio
of average objective cost and standard derivation is 108.1%
and 190.6%, respectively.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the virtual topology reconfiguration problem
on WDM networks is studied. A new problem model was
defined which combines the survivability and reconfiguration.
A simulated annealing and genetic algorithm are proposed
to solve it. Experiment results show that GA can get better
performance than SA on average and standard derivation ratio.
The ratio of objective cost and standard derivation is 108.1%
and 190.6%, respectively.

imm2.2. Assumptions
In this paper, the physical topology, existing virtual topology
and new trafﬁc demand and the reconﬁguration constraint (RC, a
positive integer) are known in advance. Moreover, we assume that:
 For each edge in physical network, there is a single ﬁber con-
nects the end-nodes in WDM network, and the data can be
transmitted bidirectional.
 For each node in physical network there is no wavelength con-
verting capability. All lightpaths should satisfy the wavelength
continuity constraint [2].
 Only the single ﬁber failure scenario is considered in this
paper.exploiting information sampled from different regions of the solu-
tion space. The combination of crossover and mutation helps GA
escape from local optima. Due to the complexity of the VTRP prob-
lem onWDM networks, the provision of an optimal solution in rea-
sonable time cannot be guaranteed. In this respect, the usual step
is to devise an approximate algorithm to ﬁnd a near optimal solu-
tion of the problem. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) is pro-
posed to solve the VTRP on survivable WDM networks. Experiment
results of the algorithms are also given.
The organization of this paper is as follows: the related works of
the VTRP are given in Section 2 and a formal description of the
VTRP problem is given in Section 3. Section 4 describes the pro-
posed genetic algorithm. Simulation results are presented in Sec-
tion 5, and some concluding remarks are given in Section 6.
2. Problem formulation
This section ﬁrst provides an overview of various terms and
notations used to explain the concepts in subsequent sections.
Thereafter, the assumptions and the objective cost of the problem
are presented.
2.1. Notations
Let GðV ; E; f Þ represent the physical topology of WDM network,
where V ¼ fvi j i ¼ 1;2; . . . ;ng is the set of (OXC) nodes,

nodes vi and vj, f ðeijÞ is the propagation delay of the ﬁber eij.
G0ðV ; E0;weiÞ is the virtual topology of WDM network G, where
E0 ¼ fe0ij j vi; vj 2 Vg is the set of virtual links. Virtual link e0ij repre-
sents the link (or lightpath) between nodes vi and vj. All links in
E0 are bidirectional, i.e., e0ij ¼ e0ji, for all vi, vj 2 V . Let pathi;j represent
the set of physical ﬁbers passed by the lightpath e0ij and the weiðe0ijÞ
is a weighted function of link e0ij which represents the propagation
delay between node vi and vj, i.e., weiðe0ijÞ ¼

that weiðe0ijÞ ¼ weiðe0jiÞ. K ¼ fkl j l ¼ 1;2; . . . ;wg represents the set
of wavelengths, and j K j¼ w. Tnn ¼ ½Tijnn, is a symmetric trafﬁc
matrix, element Tij, vi; vj 2 V represents the trafﬁc ﬂow between
nodes vi and vj. The virtual topology is dedicated path-protected,
each link in E0 is mapped to a pair of edge-disjoint paths. Let
P ¼ fp1; p2; . . . ; pjE0 jg and B ¼ fb1; b2; . . . ; bjE0 jg represent the set of
primary and backup lightpaths in the WDM network, respectively.
Note that P  E0, B  E0, P \ B ¼ ;, and P [ B ¼ E0. The minimal prop-
agation delay between nodes vs and vd on virtual topology
G0ðV ; P;weiÞ and G0ðV ;B;weiÞ are denoted as dPsd and dBsd, respec-
tively. Let TXi and RXi represent the number of transmitters and
receivers of node v , respectively.
D.-R. Din, Y.-S. Chiu / Computer Co The physical topology is two-connected, i.e., the single ﬁber fail-
ure does not disconnect the physical network.
 The existing and ﬁnal virtual topologies are connected. The transmitters and receivers are tunable. The number of trans-
mitters and receivers are ﬁxed and known.
 The reconﬁguration constraint is used to constrain the number
of changes on bidirectional lightpaths (include delete, add, or
reroute).
2.3. Objective
The minimal hop distance between nodes vs and vd on virtual
topology G0ðV ; P;1Þ and G0ðV ;B;1Þ are denoted as hPsd and hBsd,
respectively. The average weighted hop-istance (AWHD) is deﬁned
as
H ¼
P

P
sd þ hBsdÞP
8vs ;vd2VTsd
: ð1Þ
The value of hPsd is equal to h
B
sd in the dedicated path-protection vir-
tual topology. The performance and efﬁciency of a survivable virtual
topology cannot be measured by the AWHD, because it will not re-
veal the extra cost when transmitting by backup lightpath. There-
fore, the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD) is deﬁned
and used to model the performance of dedicated path-protection
virtual topology. The average weighted propagation delay is deﬁned
as

In this paper, the reconﬁguration action is performed on link of vir-
tual topology, lightpaths mapped by the link of the exiting virtual
topology can be deleted, added, and rerouted. The action performed
on one primary or backup lightpath is counted by one. In this paper,
the total number of reconﬁguration actions should be less than or
equal to RC. After performing reconﬁguration, the ﬁnal virtual
topology must be a connected graph and be survivable with dedi-
cated path-protection. In this paper, the virtual topology reconﬁgu-
ration problem (VTRP) with reconﬁguration constraint is deﬁned
and studied. Given the physical topology, virtual topology, trafﬁc
demand matrix, and the reconﬁguration constraint, the goal is to
reconﬁgure current virtual topology under the reconﬁguration con-
straint to a new one so that the AWPD can be minimized.
3. Related works
This section describes the related works of the VTRP. There are
two important issues involved in the virtual topology reconﬁgura-
tion [4–16]. One issue is selection, the goal is to determine a new
virtual topology by reconﬁguring the current virtual topology for
new trafﬁc pattern [4–11] within constraints. The other is transi-
tion, given current and new virtual topologies and the trafﬁc de-
mand, the goal is to determine the optimal transition sequence
which can be used to shift the current virtual topology to a new
one in optimal manner and/or with no service disruption
[12,13,41,42], for minimal disruption [40], or for average weighted
hop distance [39]. The VTRP studied in this paper is a selection
problem.
3.1. Reconﬁguration
In [9,16] branch-exchange algorithms were introduced to incre-
mentally adjust the virtual topology towards a desired conﬁgura-
tion. In [16], authors have sought a suitable sequence of two
branch-exchanges to transition between the two virtual topology
unications 31 (2008) 2520–2533 2521with little disruption. In [10] the authors have studied algorithms
for joint WDM reconﬁguration and IP-layer routing in IP-over-
WDM networks. The designing algorithms can operate based on
a chromosomal coding scheme, (2) initial population generation,
(3) a chromosome adjustment procedure, (4) crossover operators,
(5) mutation operators, (6) a ﬁtness function deﬁnition, (7) a
replacement strategy, and (8) termination rules.
4.1. Chromosomal coding
To solve the VTRP problem on WDM networks, three types of
genes denoted as adjustment gene (AG), routing gene (RG), and
wavelength gene (WG) are introduced. The details are described
as follows:
 Adjustment gene (AG). The adjustment gene is used to denote the
reconﬁguration action affected on logical links of the current vir-
tual topology. As described above, each link in virtual topology is
mapped to two edge-disjoint paths in physical topology. An
array AG with size 1 CR of pair integers are used to denote
the reconﬁguration actions, where CR ¼ n ðn 1Þ=2. The ith
element of AG consists of AGi and AG
0
i which are used to repre-
sent the action performed at the primary and backup paths of
the point-to-point routing problem and used by Hwang et al.
in [36] to solve the multicast routing problem in general net-
work. For each pair of nodes, there is a path table, consisting
of K edge-disjoint paths, associated with it. The edge-disjoint
path table of a pair of nodes can be computed by performing
the (K-SSLDP) proposed in [31]. Moreover, paths in the path
table are indexed increasingly according to the length of the
paths. The size of the path table, K, is a parameter of algorithm
and is initially set to a small number. The ith element of the
routing gene, denoted RGi and RG
0
i are integers z and z
0 in
f0;1;2; . . . ;Kg, for i ¼ 1;2; . . . ;CR, which represent the zth and
z0th shortest paths in the path table between vsi and vdi , respec-
tively. Note that, we assume z0 > z.
 Wavelength gene (WG). The wavelength gene is a 1 CR array
and is used to denote the assigning wavelengths of routing light-
paths. The ith element of the WG denoted asWGi andWG
0
i are in
{1, 2, . . ., w} and used to represent the assigned wavelengths of
routing paths RGi and RG
0
i, i ¼ 1;2; . . . ;CR.
The number of nonzero elements in AG is deﬁned as NZ. The
D.-R. Din, Y.-S. Chiu / Computer Communications 31 (2008) 2520–2533 2523link i, respectively. Note that, the value of ðAGi;AG0iÞ is in
{(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)}, each of which represents the
type of reconﬁguration action on the primary or backup light-
paths. If the value of ðAGi;AG0iÞ is (0, 1), then the corresponding
primary lightpath remains unchanged and the backup lightpath
is rerouted. If the value of (AGi, AG
0
i) is (1,0), then the corre-
sponding primary lightpath is rerouted and the backup lightpath
remains unchanged. If the value of (AGi, AG
0
i) is (1,1), then both
the corresponding primary and backup lightpaths are rerouted.
If the value of (AGi, AG
0
i) is (3,3), then the corresponding light-
paths are deleted from virtual topology. For these cases, they
can be applied only when the link exists on the selected node
pair of the current virtual topology. If the value of (AGi, AG
0
i) is
(2,2), then a new link (which connects the node pair and maps
to a pair of edge-disjoint paths) is added into virtual topology.
This case can be applied only when there is no link exists on
the selected node pair of the current virtual topology.
 Routing gene (RG). The routing gene (RG) is used to represent the
routing paths of the links. For a given pair of nodes (vsi ; vdi ), there
are usually many possible paths between the nodes. To repre-
sent the routing paths of the ith logical link, the path-oriented
encoding method is used to encode the path routing gene. The
path-oriented encoding scheme was ﬁrst proposed in [35] forFig. 1. The encoding mstructure of encoding used in GA for solving VTRP is shown in
Fig. 1.
4.2. Initial chromosome generating procedure
As the encoding method described in previous subsection, since
AG is the high-level gene, the content of AG does affect the contents
of the RG andWG. Once the link of virtual topology is rerouted, de-
leted or added, the corresponding routing (primary and backup)
paths and the assigned wavelengths should be updated according
to the content of AG. The initialization of chromosome can be di-
vided into three stages: (1) the initialization of AG, (2) the initial-
ization of RG, and (3) the initialization of WG. To avoid
generating infeasible solutions, the number of reconﬁguration ac-
tions of the each chromosome should be less than or equal to
reconﬁguration constraint RC and after performing these reconﬁg-
uration actions, the resulted virtual topology should be a con-
nected graph.
Let M0 be the template chromosome which represents the ori-
ginal virtual topology without performing any reconﬁguration ac-
tion. The contents of RG and WG of chromosome M0 are
represented the routing paths and assigned wavelengths of the
current virtual topology, and the content of AG of M0 is set to zero.ethod of the GA.
virtual topology is connected and NZ < RC, (2) virtual topology is
connected and NZ > RC, (3) virtual topology is disconnected and
NZ 6 RC, and (4) virtual topology is disconnected and NZ > RC. Let
CC ¼ fCC1;CC2; . . . ;CC jCCjg be the set of connected components of
the virtual topology represented by the chromosome. CC can be
found by performing connected component ﬁnding algorithm
(CCFA) proposed in [38]. Let CP ¼ fðCCg ;CChÞ j CCg ;CCh 2
CC; ðCCg ;CChÞ ¼ ðCCh; CCgÞg be the set of all pairs of connected com-
ponents. Let TCCg ;CCh ¼
P
8s2CCg ;8d2CCh ;g 6¼hTsd be the sumof demands be-
tween all pair of nodes in difference connected components CCg and
CCh. All pairs of connected components in CP are sorted in the
descending order according to the value of TCCg ;CCh .
Thedetails of thegeneadjustment algorithmareshownas follows:
 Case 2, the chromosome only violates the reconﬁguration
constraint (i.e., NZ > RC): Soft-Reducing algorithm is per-
formed to adjust the chromosome to a constraint-satisﬁed
one. Since the virtual topology is connected, some actions
of links used to reconﬁgure the virtual topology are
restored. First, randomly select a link z and the value of
(AGz, AG
0
z) not equal to (0,0). If there are some sparse
resources (wavelengths, transceivers), restore the value of
AG in the selected link z from chromosome M0, such that
the value of NZ of M can be reduced. Then this process
repeated until NZ 6 RC. The details of Soft-Reducing algo-
rithm are shown as follows:
D.-R. Din, Y.-S. Chiu / Computer Communications 31 (2008) 2520–2533 2525 Case 1, the virtual topology of the chromosome is connected and
NZ < RC: The remaining r ¼ RC  NZ actions can be used to
reconﬁgure the virtual topology. In this case, the Increment
algorithm is performed.Fig. 2. The example of crossover operated on AG (a) before crossover, (b) after crossover.
4.5. Mutation
For the gene mutation, two types of mutation operation are
used:
 Single-point mutation of routing gene (SPMRG). First, a pair of
D.-R. Din, Y.-S. Chiu / Computer Communications 31 (2008) 2520–2533 2527nodes ðvsi ; vsi Þ are randomly selected where i 2 ½1;CR and
ðAGi;AG0iÞ is in {(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)}. According to the
type of reconﬁguration action of the selected node pair, path(s)
is(are) randomly selected from the path table of the pair of
nodes ðvsi ; vsi Þ. It is worth noting that the resulting paths of the
same link should be edge-disjoint, that is, with different path
numbers. Final, the assigning wavelength of the new selecting
path(s) is(are) determined by performing the First-Fit wave-
length assignment algorithm. Because the mutation operation
does not affect the adjustment gene, there is no need to consider
the connectivity and reconﬁguration constraint.
 Bridge-retune mutation (BRTM). In general, to speed up the
convergence of the GA, heuristic algorithm is encoded into
mutation. The bridge-return mutation is tried to reduce
the weighted delay of the pair of nodes with maximal
weighted propagation delay, which are in different bi-con-
nected components. A new link, which connects the pair
of nodes and with smaller weighted delay, is selected to
adjust the virtual topology and the original bridge is
deleted. It is worth noting that, after ﬁnd a pair of edge-
disjoint paths, the values of NZ may be greater than RC-
2, thus Soft-Reducing algorithm is performed then release
some actions if necessary, so that the new link can be
added. After mutation, the original bridge link is deleted
from Bridge.
Let BCC ¼ fbcc1; bcc2; . . . ; bccjBCCjg be the set of bi-connected
components of the virtual topology represented by the
chromosome. Bridge ¼ fðbccg ; bcchÞ j 1 6 g 6¼ h 6j BCC j and
ðbccg ; bcchÞ ¼ ðbcch; bccgÞ} be the set of bridges of virtual
topology. Deﬁne WDg;h ¼
P
8s2bccg ;8d2bcch ðTsd  dsdÞ be the
weighted propagation delay between bi-connected compo-
nents bccg and bcch, where dsd be the propagation delay
between nodes vs 2 bccg and vd 2 bcch. The bridge with
the maximal weighted propagation delay is selected as
the link to be mutated. To mutate the selected link (say
(i, j)), ﬁrst, the bridge is removed from the virtual topology
and the routing information is stored and resources (wave-
lengths, transceivers, reconﬁguration actions) are released.
For the pair of bi-connected components ðbccg ; bcchÞ, per-
forming the EDPA algorithm to ﬁnd a pair of edge-disjoint
paths and the assigned wavelengths from vs 2 bccg to
vd 2 bccg on the layered graph. If the edge-disjoint paths
cannot be found, restore the edge deletion and terminate
the bridge-retune procedure. If the edge-disjoint paths are
found, then check whether the value of NZ is less than
or equal to RC  2 and the weighted delay can be reduced.
If yes, perform the mutation; otherwise if the weighted
propagation delay can be reduced, perform the Soft-Reduc-
ing algorithm to reduce NZ such that NZ 6 RC  2, and then
perform the link addition. Otherwise, restore the edge dele-
tion and terminate the bridge-retune procedure.
tion probability (pm) are shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, the

mmunications 31 (2008) 2520–2533 2529best mutation probability is 0.4.
For the mutation, the purpose is to allow GAs to avoid local min-
ima by preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming
too similar to each other, thus slowing or even stopping evolution.4.8. Termination rules
Execution of GA can be terminated when the number of gener-
ations exceeds an upper bound speciﬁed by the user.
5. Experimental results
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed GA, the
algorithm was implemented and applied to solve problems that
were randomly generated. The results of these experiments are re-
ported below. In all the experiments, the algorithms were con-
ducted in C++, and all the experiments were run on a personal
computer (PC) with a Pentium IV 2.8 HZ CPU, 1024MB RAM, and
Windows XP operation system. Two networks (N1 with 8n13e
and N2 with 24n181e) with different number of wavelengths,
transceivers, and reconﬁguration steps are used to examine the
efﬁciency of the GA. To against the single edge failure, these net-
works are two-connected. The trafﬁc demand between each node
pair ðs; dÞ of virtual topology is randomly generated according to
a uniform distribution over the range of [0,100]. The delay of ﬁber
is also randomly selected over the range of [0,100]. The virtual
topology for a given trafﬁc pattern was determined by using the
max multihop (MM) algorithm proposed in [7].
The reducing ratio deﬁned as formula (5) is used to evaluate the
performance of the virtual topology before and after performing
reconﬁguration. Deﬁne
reducing ratio ¼ OBJ
a
OBJb
; ð5Þ
where OBJa and OBJb represent the average weighted propagation
delay that offered by existing virtual topology after and before per-
forming reconﬁguration (deﬁned in Eq. (2)), respectively. Because
after performing reconﬁguration actions, the performance of the
resulting virtual topology should be better than the original virtual
topology, the value of reducing ratio is less than or equal to 1.
5.1. Parameters
In this subsection, the effects of the various parameters of GAs
are discussed. For each case, let the possible mutation probability
ðPmÞ is in {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, the possible population size pop is in
{100, 200, 400, 800}, and the number of generations Ngeneration is
2000. To determine the parameters of GA, For the networks N1
and N2 GA was performed ﬁve times and the average results are
used for the comparison.
Experiments of network N1 is associates with w ¼ 8 wave-
lengths, TR ¼ 16 ¼ TXi ¼ RXi; 8i, K ¼ 3, and RC ¼ 20. For the net-
work N1 the experimental results of different population size
ðpopÞ are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the best population
size is 400. For the network N1 the experimental results of different
mutation probability ðpmÞ are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4,
the best mutation probability is 0.3.
Experiments of Network N2 is associated with w ¼ 4 wave-
lengths, TR ¼ 14 ¼ TXi ¼ RXi; 8i, K ¼ 6, RC ¼ 120. For the network
N2 the experimental results of different population size ðpopÞ are
shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the best population size is
400. For the network N1 the experimental results of different muta-

may change intensely and be difﬁcult to converge and ﬁnd the opti-
mal solution. Moreover, increasing the mutation probability will Fig. 6. Result of GA on N2 with different value of mutation probability.
ﬁguration constraint (RC) is large. For the case of the larger net-
work, because the length of the chromosome may be long, it will
affect the efﬁciency of the GA. To tackle this problem, the encoding
method can be changed to a dynamical fashion, a new link-list of
chromosome (with maximal size less than or equal to 2 RC)
can be used to encode the reconﬁguration. The chromosome
should consist of four genes, node pair gene, adjust gene, routing
gene, and wavelength gene, each of which is the same as the one
proposed in Section 4.1 except for node pair gene. The node pair
gene is used to denote the selection of pair of nodes directed.
Moreover, the methods for initialization of chromosome, crossover,
mutation should be changed accordingly. These will save the
requirement of memory space and the new algorithm can be used
to solve larger problem in the future.
Appendix A
Because it is hard to design an efﬁciency algorithm to ﬁnd the
optimal solution if the value of reconﬁguration constraint ðRCÞ is
larger. In [34], author gave two heuristic algorithms to solve the
VTRP. They are positive reconﬁguration heuristic algorithm
(PRHA), and Conservative reconﬁguration heuristic algorithm
(CRHA). These algorithms can be divided into three stages, Prepro-
cessing, Direct Adjustment, and Indirect Adjustment.

[23,24]. Survivable WDM network design problems are mostly
formulated as integer linear programs (ILP) and are identi-
fied as NP-hard to solve.
In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Prob-
lem (VTRP) in survivable WDM networks with a reconfigu-
ration constraint is studied. The formulation and definition of
the VTRP of WDM networks are presented. Given the WDM
network, an existing dedicated path-protection VT, and a new
traffic demand matrix, the goal is to reconfigure current VT
to generate a new VT under the pre-specified reconfigura-
tion constraint (RC, a positive integer) so as to minimize the
objective value. The objective cost considered in this paper is
the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD). Because
designing polynomial time algorithms to find the optimal
solutions of VTRP is impractical, in this paper, a simulated
annealing (SA) algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) are
proposed to solve the VTRP on survivable WDM networks.
Experimental results of these algorithms are also given.
The following are the major contributions of this paper.
This is the first article that studied the problem combining
reconfiguration and survivability of WDM networks. Two
stochastic searching algorithms (based on the SA and GA
techniques) are first proposed to find the optimal VT. In the
proposed searching algorithms, several domain heuristics are
encoded into the operations of the SA and GA to help the
algorithms to find near optimal solutions.
The organization of this paper is as follows: The related
works of the VTRP are given in Sect. 2 and a formal descrip-
tion of the VTRP is given in Sect. 3. Sections 4 and 5 describe
the proposed SA and GA, respectively. Simulation results are
presented in Sect. 6, and some concluding remarks are given
in Sect. 7.
2 Related works
There are two important issues involved in the VT recon-
figuration [4–16]. One issue is selection, where the goal is
to determine a new VT by reconfiguring the current VT for
new traffic pattern [4–11] within constraints. The other is
transition; given current and new virtual topologies and the
traffic demand, the goal is to determine the optimal transition
sequence which can be used to transform the current VT to
the new one in an optimal manner and/or with no service dis-
ruption [12,13]. The VTRP studied in this paper is a selection
problem.
In [9,16] branch-exchange algorithms were introduced to
incrementally adjust the logical topology towards a desired
configuration. In [16], the authors have sought a suitable
sequence of two branch-exchanges to perform the transi-
tion between the two VT with little overall disruption to
the network. In [10], the authors have studied algorithms
for joint WDM reconfiguration and IP-layer routing in
IP-over-WDM networks. The designing algorithms can oper-
ate based on maximum weight scheduling, and reach asymp-
totically optimal throughput. In [11], the authors investigated
the VTRP of optical WDM networks by taking the traffic
grooming factor into consideration. In [11], the VTRP con-
sidering traffic grooming was formulated with new variables
and constraints by a mixed-integer linear program (MILP).
In [14], a distributed algorithm for VT reconfiguration in
the event of traffic changes in IP-Over-WDM networks was
proposed.
In [15], an iterative local search algorithm was proposed
to track rapid changes in traffic pattern for VT reconfigura-
tion and load balance. In [25], the VT design problem was
formulated and three objective functions were proposed for
finding the optimal VT for a given traffic pattern. Tradeoffs
between the amount of reconfiguration steps and optimiza-
tion of the proposed objective function were considered. In
[26], the best VT for a given network traffic-matrix was cal-
culated by ILP formulations. This methodology was based on
both optimizing a given objective function and minimizing
the changes required to obtain new VT from the current VT.
The closest VT was chosen for reconfiguration but the recon-
figuration procedure was not considered. In [25,26], the best
VT for a given network traffic using MILP formulation and
heuristic techniques was shown. In [27], three reconfigura-
tion schemes were proposed that attempt to shift from one
VT to another while keeping the network availability as high
as possible. Proposed reconfiguration algorithms can arrange
a reconfiguration sequence to minimize the mean number of
disrupted transceivers.
Two studies have discussed the issue which combines
survivability and reconfiguration. In [28], the authors stud-
ied the VTRP of survivable MPLS/WDM networks by us-
ing the existing shared protection backup resource. A novel
group-based mechanism was proposed. With this mecha-
nism, lightpaths are divided into groups and those in the same
group can be reconfigured simultaneously at one step and no
service disruption may incur during the reconfiguration pro-
cess. The goal was to find the optimal reconfiguration policy
(or sequence) which minimizes the reconfiguration steps. Lee
et al. [29] considered the survivable reconfiguration problem
on a WDM ring. In their study, given a logical topology with
its survivable embedding over a physical ring network and a
new VT to be reconfigured, the goal was to find a sequence
of lightpaths additions and deletions which satisfy the given
wavelength and port constraints such that the VT remains
survivable throughout the reconfiguration.
There are several studies related to VTRP. In [30,31],
the edge-disjoint shortest paths problem was studied. The
goal was to find a pair of routing paths which are edge-
joint and whose sum of delay is minimal. The proposed
algorithm in [30] was named as edge-disjoint shortest path
algorithm (EDSPA). In [32], the authors proposed the
123
Photon Netw Commun
AWPD is defined as
Dave =
∑
∀vs ,vd∈V Tsd × (dPsd + dBsd)∑
∀vs ,vd∈V Tsd
. (2)
In this paper, the reconfiguration action is performed on
a link of the VT; lightpaths mapped by the link of the exiting
VT can be deleted, added, and rerouted. The action performed
on one primary or backup lightpath is counted by one. In this
paper, the total number of reconfiguration actions should be
less than or equal to RC. After performing reconfiguration,
the final VT must be a connected graph and be survivable
with dedicated path-protection. In this paper, the VTRP with
a reconfiguration constraint is defined and studied. Given the
physical topology, VT, traffic demand matrix, and the recon-
figuration constraint, the goal is to reconfigure current VT
under the reconfiguration constraint to a new one so that the
AWPD can be minimized.
4 SA Algorithm for VTRP
The key elements in designing a SA algorithm are: (1) config-
uration encoding, (2) initial configuration generation, (3) per-
turbation mechanisms, and (4) cooling schedule. The details
of the SA are now described.
4.1 Configuration encoding
To reconfigure a VT under the constraint RC, the algorithm
developed to solve the VTRP should select the links to be
updated, added, rerouted, or deleted; determine the primary
and backup routing paths and assigned wavelengths of the
selected lightpaths so that the objective function can be min-
imized. To do this; the configuration space is designed to be
the set of possible solutions. Consider a given logical link
of the VT; the configuration encoding of the reconfigura-
tion action of the link includes (1) end-nodes, (2) the type of
reconfiguration action, (3) the routes of primary and backup
paths, and (4) the assigned wavelengths of the paths. These
are denoted as End-nodes (EN), Adjustment (AD), Routing
Path (RP), and Wavelength Assignment (WA), as shown in
Fig. 1. The details of the configuration encoding of a config-
uration are described as follows:
− End-nodes (EN): The end-nodes are the source and des-
tination nodes of the link (including the primary and
backup lightpaths). The source and destination node of
the selected logical link is denoted as ENs and ENd ,
respectively.
− Adjustment (AD): The adjustment is used to denote the
reconfiguration action affected on the logical link of
the current VT. As described above, each link in VT
Fig. 1 Configuration of the SA
is mapped to two edge-disjoint paths in physical topol-
ogy. The value of AD consists of ADp and ADb which
are used to represent the actions affected on the primary
and backup paths, respectively. Note that the value of
pair (ADp, ADb) is ∈ {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3,
3)}, each of which represents the type of reconfiguration
actions on the primary and backup lightpaths. If the
value of AD is (0, 1) the corresponding primary lightpath
remains unchanged but the backup lightpath is rerouted.
If the value of AD is (1, 0) the corresponding primary
lightpath is rerouted but the backup lightpath remains
unchanged. If the value of AD is (1, 1) the correspond-
ing primary and backup lightpaths are rerouted. If the
value of AD is (3, 3) the corresponding lightpaths are
deleted from VT. These cases can be applied only when
the link exists on current VT. If the value is (2, 2) the cor-
responding link (which maps to two lightpaths) is added
into VT. This case can be applied only when no link
exists on current VT.
− Routing path (RP): The RP is used to represent the rout-
ing paths of the link. To represent the routing paths of the
link which connects node pair (ENs,ENd ), the path-
oriented encoding method is used. First, for each pair
of nodes, an edge-disjoint path-table is constructed by
performing the K-SSLDP algorithm proposed in [32].
Then, paths in the path-table are indexed increasingly
according to the delay of the path. The size of the path-
table, K , is a parameter of the algorithm and is initially
set to a small integer. The routing paths RPp and RPb
are integers z and z′ in {1, 2, . . . , K} which represent
the zth and z′th smallest delay paths in the path-table
between ENs and ENd , respectively. Without lost of
generation, assume that z′ is greater than z.
− Wavelength Assignment (WA): The WA is used to
denote the assigned wavelengths of routing lightpaths.
The WAp and WAb are in {1, 2,…,w} and used to repre-
sent the assigned wavelengths of routing paths RPp and
RPb, respectively.
To use a configuration to represent a solution of the VTRP,
an 1×R (the value of R is determined through experiments)

4.3 Perturbation mechanisms
Several types of perturbations are introduced to the SA algo-
rithm to generate the possible next configuration. They are:
(1) Addition-first perturbation (AFP), (2) Path-reroute per-
turbation (PRP), (3) Action-change perturbation (ACP), (4)
Link-addition perturbation (LAP), and (5) Heuristic-add
perturbation (HAP).
− P1 Addition-first perturbation (AFP): For a given
CONF , shift all link-addition actions (ADpi ,ADbi ) =
(2, 2) to the left of CONF .
− P2 Path-reroute perturbation (PRP): First, randomly
select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) from a given config-
uration whose adjustment (ADpi , ADbi ) is in {(1, 0), (0,
1), (1, 1), (3, 3)}. Second, for each lightpath whose value
of AD is not equal to (0, 0), randomly select a new rout-
ing path in the edge-disjoint path-table of the node pair
(ENsi , ENdi ). Note that the value cannot be equal to the
path number of the other path of the same link. Finally,
determine the assigned wavelengths of the routing paths
by performing the First-Fit wavelength assignment algo-
rithm.
− P3 Action-change perturbation (ACP): First, randomly
select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) from CONF. The value of
AD is randomly changed to another type of adjustment.
If there is a link in the original VT, then all actions can
be selected, except the link-addition action. If there is no
link in the original VT, only the link-addition action can
be selected. After determining the action of the link, the
routing paths are determined randomly and the assigned
wavelengths can be determined by performing the First-
Fit method.
− P4 Link-addition perturbation (LAP): First, randomly
select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) from CONF whose value
of AD is in {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (3, 3) } and change the
value of (ADpi , ADbi ) to (2, 2). Randomly select a pair of
nodes not in the current VT. Then, the routing paths can
be determined randomly and the assigned wavelengths
are determined by performing the First-Fit method.
− P5 Heuristic-add perturbation (HAP): First, randomly
select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ R) and change the value of
AD to (2, 2). The pair of nodes NE is determined by the
following steps. First, let G′′ = Gnew and apply actions
conf1,…,confi−1 on G
′′
. Then, find the logical link with
minimal cost for a pair of nodes (NEsi , NEdi ) not in the
current VT. Then, the routing paths are selected from the
edge-disjoint path-table of node pair (NEsi , NEdi ) and
the assigned wavelengths are determined by performing
the First-Fit method.
These perturbations are used to change the state of the con-
figuration. Let probi be the probability of transforming the
current configuration to a new one by applying the perturba-
tion Pi , i = 1, 2, . . . , 5, respectively. Let ∑5i=1 probi = 1,
AP0 = 0, and APi = ∑ij=1 probj be the accumulated prob-
ability of performing perturbation Pi , i = 1, 2, . . . , 5.
4.4 SA algorithm
SA starts from a random initial configuration which is
obtained by performing the Random Initialization algorithm.
Given a temperature T , the algorithm randomly selects one
of the perturbations and computes the variation. As typical
in SA, the probability of accepting a non-improving per-
turbation decreases over time. This behavior is obtained by
decreasing the temperature as follows. SA uses a variable
counter that is incremented for each non-improving pertur-
bation and reset to zero when the best solution found so far
is improved. When the counter reaches a particular upper
limit, the temperature is updated to T ×γ (where γ is a fixed
constant smaller than 1) and the counter is reset to zero. The
details of the SA are described as follows:
Algorithm: SA
set initial temperature T ;
perform Random Initialization to generate CONF;
BestSoFar = Cost (CONF).
counter = 0; phase = 0;
while (phase ≤ maxPhases) do
{
counter = 0;
while (counter ≤ counterLimit) do
{
generate a random number p in [0, 1);
if (APi−1 ≤ p ≤ APi , (i = 1, 2,…, 5))
{
apply the Pi perturbation schema to generate new configuration NCONF ;
compute C = Cost (CONF) − Cost (NCONF);
}
if (C ≥ 0)

Fig. 2 Single point crossover operator
mosome should have a probability of being selected as parent
that is proportional to its fitness, the fitness function needs to
be expressed in a maximization form. This can be done by
subtracting the objective from a large number Dmax. Hence,
the fitness function becomes:
max {Dmax − Dave}, (3)
where Dave be the objective value and Dmax denotes the max-
imum value observed so far, of the cost function in the pop-
ulation. Let Dcost be the value of the cost function for the
chromosome; Dmax can be calculated by the following iter-
ative equation:
Dmax = max{Dmax,Dcost}, (4)
where Dmax is initialized to zero.
5.5 Replacement strategy
This subsection discusses a method used to generate a new
generation of population after crossover and mutation are
applied on the chromosomes of the previous generation.
After crossover, chromosomes are sorted according to the
fitness function in increasing order. According to the com-
puted fitness values, some of the chromosomes are selected
in order to generate more offspring through crossover opera-
tions; chromosomes with large fitness values will survive and
reproduce more. On the other hand, chromosomes with small
fitness values will die off. The reproduction process selects a
certain number of chromosomes with the best fitness values
from the current generation for reproduction. Another group
of chromosomes, again with the best fitness values, is selected
to reproduce offspring through the crossover operation. Note
that the number of the chromosomes in the chromosome pool
is always restricted to the population size (pop). Execution
of GA can be terminated when the number of generations
exceeds an upper bound (Ngeneration) specified by the user.
5.6 Termination rules
Execution of GA can be terminated when the number of gen-
erations exceeds an upper bound specified by the user.
6 Experimental results
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SA and GAs,
these algorithms were implemented by the C++ language.
Experiments were run on a personal computer with Pentium
IV 2.8 GHz CPU, 1024 MB RAM, and Windows XP opera-
tion system. Three physical networks (N1 with 30n348e, N2
with 50n980e, and N3 with 20n152e) were randomly gen-
erated and used to examine the efficiency of the proposed
algorithms. The VT for a given traffic pattern was determined
by using the max multihop (MM) algorithm proposed in [7].
The traffic demand between each node pair (s, d) of VT is
randomly generated according to a uniform distribution over
the range of [0, 1000]. The delay of fiber is also randomly
selected over the range of [0, 100].
In this section, first, the experiments for determining the
parameters (such as chain length, rate γ , and R) of SA are
reported. Then, the effects of the parameters (such as pop-
ulation size (pop), mutation probability (pm), iteration (or
generation Ngeneration), and configuration length (R) of GA)
are reported. Finally, the two algorithms are compared and
the results are shown. In the following, for each experiment,
10 runs are tested and the average result is computed and
compared.
6.1 Parameters of SA
In network N1, each link consists of 30 wavelengths and
each node consists of 16 transceivers. The minimal num-
ber of edge-disjoint paths between two nodes in N1 is 13,
the number of links in VT is 50, reconfiguration constraint
RC is 50, and the configuration length R is 25. In network
N2, each link consists of 50 wavelengths and each node con-
sists of 16 transceivers. The minimal number of edge-disjoint
paths between two nodes in N2 is 34, the number of links in
VT is 150, reconfiguration constraint RC is 100, and the
configuration length R is 100.

R = 100)

6.1.4 Effect of RC
For network N2 with R = 100, the effect of objective cost
and the CPU time in milliseconds (ms) for different values
of RC is shown Fig. 8. The result shows that SA with RC =
200 exhibits the best result on average.
6.2 Parameters of GA
In this subsection, the effects of the various parameters of
GA are discussed. In network N3, each link consists of 20
wavelengths and each node consists of 16 transceivers. The
minimal number of edge-disjoint paths between two nodes
in N1 is 8, the number of links in VT is 50, reconfiguration
constraint RC is 50, and the configuration length R is 25.
For network N3, the effect of objective cost and the CPU
time in milliseconds (ms) for different population sizes (pop)
is shown in Fig. 9. As shown, for the average case behav-
ior, the best population size is 200. When the population
increases, the CPU time spent by the GA also increases.
For network N3, the effect of objective cost and the CPU
time in milliseconds (ms) for different values of mutation
probability (pm) is shown in Fig. 10. As shown, for the aver-
age case behavior, the best mutation probability (pm) is 0.9.
Fig. 10 Result of GA on N3 with different values of pm (n = 20)
Fig. 11 Result of GA on N3 with different values of Ngeneration (n =
20)
When the mutation probability increases, the cost of the final
VT decreases and the CPU time spent by the GA increases.
The effect objective cost and the CPU time in milliseconds
(ms) for different values of iterations (Ngeneration) is shown
in Fig. 11. As shown, when the value of iterations increases,
the cost of the final VT decreases and the spent time also
increases.
6.3 Comparisons
This subsection compares the SA and GAs. The algorithms
were run with 10 random seeds on each problem in order

bandwidth allocation with multiple services (DBAM) 失敗。除此之外， Q-DBA可以達到
fairness index of average data delay 接近 1。 
4. Signaling Protocol to Reduce Blocking Probability in Optical Burst Switching Mesh 
Networks with Limited Wavelength Conversion Capabilities: Optical Burst Switching (OBS)
為下一代光學骨幹的先進的交換器，但將 OBS 商品化仍會遭遇到兩個問題上：burst 
contention 與 limited wavelength conversion capability (LWCC)。在本論文中，作者提出
OBS-LWCC 網 路 上 的 一 個 新 的 訊 號 協 定 (signaling protocol) ， 稱 為
Wavelength-Amend-on-Demand (WAoD)。為先前 Delay-on-demand的 一個改進的版本。其
主要目的在當 resource contentions發生時，避免資料被拋棄，並部份消除波長連續性的限
制(wavelength continuity constraint)。所研究的結果顯示，心的協定在 overall burst blocking 
probability有極大的改進。 
5. Delayed reservation decision in optical burst switching networks with optical buffers : The 
proposed delayed reservation decision scheme offers the same node complexity as that in 
general OBS networks with optical buffers. Simulations show the proposed scheme has better 
performance than existing schemes in terms of burst loss probability. 
6. A Study On Resilient Packet Star-Ring: Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) is a key technology on 
the development of Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN). Because of the limitation of ring 
structure, this paper propose a novel scheme which combines RPR and WDM technology: by 
putting ring structure together with star structure , we get a bidirectional four-ring structure, in 
which the outer two rings form a standard RPR, and the inner two rings form a star structure 
logically. The simulation analysis shows the performance of the proposed structure including 
transmission delay and throughputs are prior to the RPR. 
7. Fault Detection for OSPF Based E-NNI Routing with Probabilistic Testing Algorithm: In 
this paper, a probabilistic testing algorithm is proposed to increase the fault coverage for OSPF 
based E-NNI routing protocol testing. It automatically constructs random network topologies 
and checks database information consistency with real optical network topology and resource 
for each generated topology. Theoretical analysis indicates that our algorithm can efficiently 
increase the fault coverage. This algorithm has been implemented in a software test tool called 
E-NNI Routing Testing System (ERTS). Experiment results based on ERTS are also reported. 
8. Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem on Survivable WDM Networks: In this paper, 
the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem (VTRP) on survivable WDM networks with 
reconfiguration constraint is studied. Given a physical topology, a dedicated path-protected 
virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal of VTRP is to reconfigure the current 
virtual topology under the pre-specified reconfiguration constraint such that the objective value 
can be minimized. The objective value considered in this paper is the average weighted 
propagation delay (AWPD). Because designing a polynomial time algorithm to find the optimal 
solution of VTRP is impractical when the reconfiguration constraint is larger. In this paper, a

Dedicated Protection
 In dedicated protection, for each connection (or virtual link), 
there is a pair of edge-disjoint (primary and a backup) 
lightpaths on physical network.
 Survivable WDM network design problem is defined as: Given 
the traffic demand and the physical topology, the goal is to 
design a survivable virtual topology with some resource
Introduction
        
constraints (links, wavelengths, transceivers) to against the 
single fiber failure so that the objective cost can be minimized.
 The survivable WDM network design problems are mostly 
formulated as integer linear programs (ILP) and identified as 
NP-hard to solve.

Goal of this paper
 In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem 
(VTRP) in survivable WDM networks with a reconfiguration 
constraint is formulated and studied.  
 Given the WDM network, an existing dedicated path-protection 
virtual topology and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal is to 
reconfigure current virtual topology to generate a new virtual
Introduction
         
topology under the pre-specified reconfiguration constraint (RC, 
a positive integer) so as to minimize the objective value. 
 The objective cost considered in this paper is the average 
weighted propagation delay (AWPD). 
2008/8/29 Der-Rong Din, CSIE NCUE Taiwan ROC 8
VRTP
When the value of RC is large, the VTRP is a hard 
problem.
 In this paper, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm 
and a genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed to solve 
the VTRP on survivable WDM networks.
Introduction
     
 Experimental results of these algorithms are also given.
2008/8/29 Der-Rong Din, CSIE NCUE Taiwan ROC 9
Assumptions of VTRP
 In this paper, the physical topology, existing virtual topology, 
new traffic demand, and the reconfiguration constraint (RC, a 
positive integer) are known in advance. 
 For each edge in the physical network, there is a single fiber 
connecting the end-nodes in the WDM network, and the data 
can be transmitted bidirectionally
Definition
   .
 For each node in the physical network there is no wavelength 
converting capability.
 All lightpaths should satisfy the wavelength continuity 
constraint .
 Only the single fiber failure scenario is considered in this 
paper.
2008/8/29 Der-Rong Din, CSIE NCUE Taiwan ROC 10
Assumptions of VTRP(cont.)
 The physical topology is two-connected, i.e., the 
single fiber failure does not disconnect the physical 
network.
 The existing and final virtual topologies are connected.
 The transmitters and receivers are tunable
Definition
     . 
 The number of transmitters and receivers are fixed and 
known.
 The reconfiguration constraint is used to constrain the 
number of changes on lightpaths (including delete, add, 
or re-route).

GREETINGS FROM THE TECHNICAL PROGRAM COMMITTEE CHAIRS 
 
Welcome to the technical program of the Third International Conference on Communications and 
Networking in China (CHINACOM 2008). Communications and Networking play a vital role in today's 
global economy, and certainly so in China. Following the great success of CHINACOM 2006 and 
CHINACOM 2007, CHINACOM 2008 will again bring together Chinese and international researchers and 
practitioners to showcase recent research advances in communications and networking.  
We received 822 submissions from 36 countries/regions in 5 continents, among which over 500 submissions 
were from mainland China. This reflects the fact that China is the host of this conference and also that the 
growth of her research activities is aligned with her economic growth. After employing a thorough review 
process to ensure an excellent technical program, 270 papers, including some invited papers, have been 
accepted for presentation, representing an acceptance rate of less than 33%. The technical program consists 
of 8 symposia, 3 workshops, and 2 special/industrial sessions. Papers reflect research activities at the 
forefront, with topics ranging the full spectrum of communications and networking. The program also 
features two keynote addresses by Dr. Andrzej Jajszczyk, Professor at AGH University of Science and 
Technology, Krakow, Poland, and Mr. Houlin Zhao, Deputy Secretary-General of ITU.  
The technical program team did an excellent job in soliciting participation, coordinating the review process, 
and promoting the technical program. We would like to thank everyone of them for taking leadership roles in 
organizing the various aspects of the technical program. This includes the symposium chairs, workshop 
chairs, special session chairs, and panel chairs: Mohammed Atiquzzaman, Subir Biswas, Alister Burr, 
Rajarathnam Chandramouli, Hsiao-Hwa Chen, Jun Chen, Chong-Yung Chi, Károly Farkas, Hongya Ge, 
Stefanos Gritzalis, Jianjun He, Aiping Huang, Fei Hu, Nei Kato, Cheng Li, Shiwen Mao, Yongyi Mao, 
Neelesh B. Mehta, Claude Oestges, Peiliang Qiu, Abdallah Shami, Gerard Smit, Lingyang Song, Zhifeng 
Tao, Wade Trappe, Chonggang Wang, Yi Wang, Sarah Kate Wilson, Linda Jiang Xie, Lu Yu, Baoxian 
Zhang, Yan Zhang, Chi Zhou, and Luying Zhou.  
Another important component of the technical program is the reviewers who volunteered their time and 
professional expertise. We also would like to take this opportunity to thank each and everyone of them. Last 
but not the least, we would like to thank the authors for contributing their quality works.  
Finally, on behalf of the entire TPC, we welcome you to CHINACOM 2008 and we hope you will enjoy the 
technical program and get a chance to meet new friends and colleagues from all over the world.

Global ICT Development and ITU 
 
ABSTRACT 
Telecommunications and information and communication technologies (ICT) are amongst the main drivers for the social and 
economic development of mankind and play a vital role in enhancing access to basic services in all sectors of life and in meeting 
the targets in millennium development goals. With almost half of the world’s population having access to mobile cellular services, 
the increasing and sustained growth in Internet usage and broadband deployment, ITU, as the leading United Nations Agency in 
ICTs with a mission to connect the unconnected, is playing a leading role in the global coordination of activities and initiatives 
aimed at using ICTs to contribute towards solutions to a number of global issues. As the oldest UN agency, with a global presence 
and a membership that includes 191 countries and 700 sector members, ITU’s mission is to bring the benefits of ICTs to the 
world’s inhabitants. Global issues as the digital divide, cyber-insecurity, emergency telecommunications and climate change are 
high priorities in the agenda of ITU and central to its strategies and work programmes. In its unique role in the global management 
of the radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits for fixed, mobile, broadcasting, amateur, space research, ITU activities pave 
the way for the current and future landscapes of mobile and wireless communications worldwide. Through its global telecom 
forums and exhibitions, ITU brings together policy makers and industry leaders to showcase technologies and discuss global 
policies and strategies. 
BIOGRAPHY 
Born on 7 March 1950 in Jiangsu (China), Houlin Zhao graduated from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 
1975. Between 1979 and 1980, he studied as a visiting scholar in Switzerland. He joined the University of Essex (United Kingdom) 
in 1984, where he obtained a Master of Science degree in Telematic in 1985. From 1975 to 1986, Houlin Zhao worked as an 
engineer in the Designing Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of China. He took an active part in his 
country's experts meetings on national telecommunication standards as well as in various national projects. He received a prize in 
1985 for his science and technology achievements in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Between 1982 and 1983, he 
participated in CCITT Study Group meetings as a Chinese delegate. He published a number of technical articles in several Chinese 
magazines. Houlin Zhao joined the CCITT Secretariat (now Telecommunication Standardization Bureau TSB) in 1986. responsible 
for standardization on non-voice telecommunication technologies including telex, telegraph, data communication, videotext, 
message handling system (MHS), open system interconnection (OSI), directory, network security, etc. He was designated as 
CCITT Coordinator for the cooperation with ISO, IEC and ISO/IEC JTC 1 in 1989. From 1998, Houlin Zhao was elected by ITU 
Plenipotentiary Conference as Director of the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB), the first non-European expert at 
this position in the ITU history since 1865, In 2002, he was re-elected. In his two terms as Director of TSB from 1999 to 2006, he 
introduced effective and efficient measures to improve ITU's standards environment and strengthened its promotion. He also 
enhanced the strategic partnership between Member States (governments) and Sector Members (industries), while initiating and 
maintaining good relationships with industry members. Under his leadership, ITU facilitated international cooperation with other 
standards development organizations and forums and helped bridge the standardization gap between the developing and developed 
countries. Houlin Zhao was elected Deputy Secretary-General of ITU at the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference in Antalya, Turkey, in 
November 2006 for a term between 2007 and 2010. As the only Deputy Secretary-General, he assists the Secretary-General to 
manage ITU. Houlin Zhao holds a number of honorable titles or senior consultation member in various entities in China, including 
Telematic Honorable Chairman of the ICT Committee of China Association of Senior Professors and “visiting Professor” at a 
number of well-known universities in China. He holds also a number of honorable titles or member of Advisory Group of various 
institutions or fora abroad, including Honorable Doctor of Russian Telecommunication Academy.
