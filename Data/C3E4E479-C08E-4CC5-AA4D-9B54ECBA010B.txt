  
materials, such as polyacrylonitrile-polyethylene oxide copolymer [4]. Sivakumar [5] 
reported the conductivity and phase structure of PVA-PMMA blend electrolytes complexed 
with LiBF4 salt. Gurunathan reviewed the developments in conducting polymers [6]. The 
electrical conductivity in the conjugated polymers could be further improved for solid-state 
rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. On the other hand, sulfonation has been effective 
in providing hydrophilic surfaces [7,8]. The strongly polarized sulfuric acid groups act as 
electrophilic centers that could react with carbon atoms in the polymer chains. 
Chemical and physical treatment techniques play important roles in polymer surface 
modification [9,10]. It has led to the development of various applications in biomedical uses 
and electrochemical systems such as blood-compatible polyethylene [11], sulfonated 
polyether ether ketone [12,13] and sulfonated polystyrene [14]. However, there has been little 
discussion on anionic conductivity. The issues on long-term stability and production cost 
remain to be resolved. The power density and discharge current density need to be further 
improved to meet the stringent requirements for the electrochemical applications. 
In this paper, we studied the high anionic conducting membranes from microporous 
polypropylene. The membranes had numerous pores of about 400x50 nm in size. The 
porosity was about 40-50%. Infrared study verified the incorporation of sulfonic acid groups 
(-SO3H), and the sulfur content was determined by elemental analysis (EA). XRD was used 
to investigate the crystal structure and crystallinity. SEM was to reveal the microporous 
structure and morphology. The surface hydrophilicity was measured by a video contact angle 
system. The anionic conductivities of the sulfonated membranes with KOH electrolyte were 
studied by AC impedance spectroscopy. The anionic transport number values with different 
alkaline metal hydroxide solutions were measured using the Hittorf’s method [15,16]. The 
mechanical strength and the elongation properties were determined by the tensile stress-strain 
tests. In addition, the solid-state zinc-air cells were assembled and the battery electrochemical 
performances would be evaluated. 
 
2. Experimental 
The membrane samples were immersed in 32 wt-% KOH solution for 24 h, and the 
conductivity was measured by an AC impedance method. The alkaline membrane composite 
was sandwiched between SS316 stainless steel, ion-blocking electrodes, each of the surface 
area 0.785 cm2, in a spring-loaded glass holder. A thermocouple was used to monitor the 
temperature. AC impedance analysis was carried out using an AutoLab from Eco Chemi and 
a computer program FRA. The frequency ranged from 100 Hz to 100 kHz at an excitation 
  
carbons were not much different after the sulfuric acid treatments. The IEC of membrane 
sample was analyzed in Fig. 4. It became as high as 0.21 meq./g when the sulfonation 
reaction time was 128 h. During the reaction with membrane surface molecules, the polarized 
acid could abstract hydride ions, producing more stable alkane or alkene sulfonic acid groups.  
The AC impedance spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The Rb value was converted into ionic 
conductivity, using the equation σ = l Rb-1 A-1. It has been in the range of 0.5-1.5 ohm.  The 
ionic conductivity of the sulfonated sample could be as high as 3.52×10-2 S cm-1. This 
represented an improvement of 132% from that of the control (σ = 1.52×10-2 S cm-1). 
The anionic transport numbers were in the range of 0.73-0.81 for 1 M LiOH solution, 
0.78-0.85 for 1 M NaOH solution, and 0.81-0.89 for 1 M KOH solution. The polymer 
membrane-KOH composites thus exhibited higher anionic transport numbers than those of 
the other two systems. This was likely due to the higher ionic mobility and the degree of 
dissociation/activity of KOH alkaline metal salts in the polymer matrix. The hydrodynamic 
radius of cation also affects the access of free OH- ions in the membrane composite system. 
The anionic transport number for the control membrane was 0.73 for 1 M LiOH solution, 
0.77 for 1 M NaOH solution, and 0.79 for 1 M KOH solution. The results indicated that the 
sulfonation reaction could enhance the anion transport ability in the microporous membranes. 
The results also corresponded to the trend in ionic conductivity change with sulfonation time. 
The t- values exhibited the highest data at 0.89 for the highly sulfonated membranes with 1 M 
KOH solution. 
The solid-state zinc-air cells were assembled for electrochemical evaluation using a 
charge/discharge unit. Fig. 6 shows the cell potential of the Zn-air cells as a function of 
discharge current density using the different membranes as separators. The open-circuit 
voltage was in the range of 1.25-1.35 V, depending on the membrane sulfonation treatment 
time. Higher discharge current densities were also achieved for the sulfonated samples. On 
the other hand, the corresponding power density curves were also included in the same figure. 
It was indicated that high power density of 38 mW/cm2 had been successfully achieved under 
the discharge current density of 45 mA/cm2 with the sulfonated membrane separator. This 
was about 90% improvement over the original, untreated sample, which was only around 20 
mW/cm2. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The effects of sulfonation on microporous membranes had been investigated. Infrared study 
verified the proper incorporation of sulfonic acid groups in the polymer that could increase

Enhanced light extraction in GaN based light emitting diodes by focused ion 
beam generated photonic crystals 
 
High brightness light emitting diodes (LED) have drawn much attention for a variety 
of applications in printers, flat panel displays, automobiles, and general lighting 
devices. Improvements in light extraction with lower power consumption are greatly 
desired. Although the internal quantum efficiency (QE) of GaN based LEDs has been 
close to 98-100%, only a small fraction of light can escape because of the interface 
refraction between GaN and the outer medium. Two-dimensional photonic crystal 
structures have been designed and incorporated on the top p-GaN layers to improve 
the emission efficiency by the factor of 1.3-2.2. The photonic crystals could be 
fabricated using the focused ion beam (FIB) in a dual-beam nanotechnology 
workstation system SMI 3050. The acceleration voltage of the Ga ion beam was fixed 
at 30 kV and the ion beam current was 6 nA. The LED area was chosen to be 155×85 
μm2 with both top and bottom pads. The structures had a hole diameter of 150 nm, 
but with different periods. In addition, we developed Bandsolve simulation tools for 
the photonic crystal band structures, and the simulation results supported our 
experimental observations. The correlations in structure-property analyses would be 
discussed in details.
