source. In this way, the effect on the light path of 
each boundary surface within the optical system can 
be systematically examined. Traditionally, 
determining optical aberrations mathematically has 
always been a formidable task, involving a virtually 
infinite amount of ray tracing. However, sensitivity 
analysis enables the construction of basic aberration 
functions which greatly simplify the optical design 
task [4, 5]. Moreover, sensitivity analysis provides 
a convenient means of calculating the path of the 
chief ray; an important characteristic ray in optical 
systems. For example, Lin and Liao [7] performed a 
sensitivity analysis based on a Jacobian matrix and 
the Newton–Raphson method to determine the path 
followed by the chief ray in a binocular stereo 
vision system. Sensitivity analysis also enables the 
orientation of an image to be accurately determined. 
For example, Tsai and Lin [8] employed a merit 
function derived from a sensitivity analysis to track 
the change in orientation of an image as it was 
successively reflected / refracted at the flat 
boundary surfaces within a prism. 
In many ways, designing an optical system is 
analogous to the process of designing a machine 
tool. In the same way that optical systems comprise 
a series of optical elements, machine tools comprise 
a series of mechanical links and joints. When 
designing mechanical systems, it is essential to 
identify the potential sources of error within the 
system, and to clarify their individual and combined 
effects, such that the quality of the machined 
products can be reliably determined. In 1972, 
Tlusty [9] examined the correlation between the 
overall error of a six-axis NC machine tool and the 
errors in each of its degrees of freedom. Ferreira 
and Liu [10] developed a generic model based on 
three rotational errors, i.e. ,  and iΔΓ iΔΨ iΔΦ , and 
three translational errors, i.e. ,  and , to 
enable the systematic analysis of the machining 
performance of a multi-link machine tool. Taking 
the case of a jig-boring machine for illustration 
purposes, Schultshik [11] applied the same errors to 
investigate the combined effect of the various 
components of the volumetric accuracy of a 
machine tool on its machining precision. In a 
similar study, Dobowsky et al. [12] employed a 
parameter identification approach to identify the 
principal kinematic errors in planar mechanisms. 
iΔX iΔY iΔZ
The geometrical precision of the components 
produced by a machine tool is dependent upon the 
quality and configuration of each of its links and 
joints. In the same way, the quality of the image 
produced by an optical system is determined by the 
errors which inevitably exist in the fabrication and 
assembly of the individual optical components 
within it. Provided that the resolution of each 
optical component is known, sensitivity analysis 
provides the means to establish the respective 
contribution of each optical boundary surface along 
the ray path to the overall resolution of the optical 
system. However, ray tracing though aspherical 
surfaces such as those considered in the present 
study is difficult since the point at which the ray 
intersects the aspherical surface cannot be directly 
determined. Hence, conventional ray tracing 
methods do not easily lend themselves to the 
sensitivity analysis of optical systems comprising 
aspherical elements. Smith [13] attempted to 
resolve this problem by developing an iterative 
method for aspherical-boundary skew ray tracing 
based on a series of approximations which 
continued until the approximation error reduced to a 
negligible value. However, the method was time 
consuming and computationally expensive. 
In recent studies, the current author developed a 
computationally straightforward error analysis 
technique based on a skew ray tracing approach for 
the analysis of light path errors as the light ray was 
reflected and/or refracted at a succession of optical 
elements with flat boundary surface [14]. In the 
current study, this technique is extended to the error 
analysis of optical systems comprising elements 
with paraboloidal boundary surfaces. The error 
analysis model proposed in this study considers six 
specific sources of light path error, i.e. three 
rotational errors and three translational errors, and 
incorporates an error matrix which takes account 
not only of the effects of these errors on the 
deviation of the light path at each boundary surface, 
but also the differential changes induced in the 
incident point position and unit directional vector of 
the refracted / reflected ray as a result of differential 
changes in the position and unit directional vector 
of the light source. 
In general, the homogeneous coordinate 
representation of a vector in 3-space is a 4-space 
entity specified such that a particular perspective 
projection recreates the 3-space. Transforming a 
vector in 3-space to a homogeneous coordinate 
representation requires the addition of an additional 
coordinate (i.e. a scale factor) to each vector such 
that the vector retains its original meaning when

The ambiguous sign of the root term in Eq. (6) 
corresponds to the two possible points of 
intersection of the ray with the paraboloidal 
boundary surface. In the current ray tracing analysis, 
only one point is required, i.e. the initial incident 
point, and thus the appropriate sign must be 
carefully chosen. The parameters  and  of 
the incident point on the paraboloidal boundary 
surface are crucial in determining the subsequent 
path of the refracted ray, and are defined as follows:

3. Simulation of ray path errors induced at 
refractive paraboloidal boundary surface 
This section demonstrates the validity of the 
error analysis methodology presented above using 
the case of a generic optical element with a 
paraboloidal boundary surface for illustration 
purposes. In performing the analysis, it is assumed 
that the light source is located at 
and the unit directional vector 
of the incident ray  is refracted 
at the paraboloidal boundary surface. In defining 
the boundary surface, the paraboloidal boundary 
parameter a1 is assigned a value of 0.015 unless 
stated otherwise and N1 (i.e. the refractive index 
parameter) is assumed to have values of 1.5, 2.0 or 
2.5 (see Figure 4). The relative configuration of the 
world frame  with respect to the paraboloidal 
boundary surface frame  is given by

Abstract—This paper studies the bifurcation behavior of the 
probe tip of an atomic force microscope with a 
proportional-plus-derivative (PD) feedback control using the 
DT (differential transformation) method. The dynamic behavior 
of the probe tip with PD control law is characterized by 
reference to maximum Lyapunov exponent plots produced 
using the time-series data obtained from differential 
transformation method. Furthermore, the detailed transitions 
in the dynamic response of the probe tip are examined using 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively. The results indicate that the probe tip 
behavior is significantly dependent on the magnitude of the 
proportional and derivative control gain. Specifically, the probe 
tip motion includes T-, 2T-, 3T-, 4T-, multi-periodic, and chaotic 
motion. Numerical results show that the dynamic behavior will 
leave chaotic motion to periodic motion at Kp=-0.45 in the 
steady state by changing the control loop gain Kv from -0.1 to 
-1.0. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the differential 
transformation method is in good agreement for the considered 
system. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE atomic force microscope (AFM) provides a powerful 
tool for surface analysis applications in the 
nano-electronics, materials and biotechnology fields. During 
operation, intermolecular forces between the AFM probe tip 
and the sample surface cause a deflection of the 
microcantilever on which the probe tip is mounted. The 
variation in force acting on the tip is then evaluated by using 
some form of optical technique to measure the deflection of 
the cantilever. 
The nonlinear dynamic behavior of an AFM system is a 
major concern since any irregular motion of the AFM probe 
tip inevitably degrades the precision of the measurement 
results. Burnham et al. [1], [2] showed that the

microcantilever of an AFM performed chaotic motion under 
specific physical conditions. Ashhab et al. [3] modeled the 
microcantilever of an AFM using a single-frequency mode 
approximation and analyzed the chaotic dynamics of the 
cantilever-sample system using the Melnikov method. Lee et 
al. [4] analyzed the effects of van der Waals and 
Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov forces on the tip-sample 
interactions induced in dynamic force microscopy (DFM). 
The authors also presented detailed experimental results 
which provided valuable new perspectives and insights into 
DFM. Ruetzel et al. [5] applied the Galerkin method to 
investigate the nonlinear dynamics of an AFM probe tip 
under the assumption that the tip-surface interactions were 
governed by Lennard-Jones potentials. Based upon their 
analysis, the authors showed that the probe tip exhibited a 
broad range of dynamic phenomena, including both periodic 
and chaotic motion. 
However, none of the studies reviewed above presented 
phase portraits, power spectra, Poincaré maps, maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots or bifurcation diagrams to confirm 
the validity of their predictions for the AFM behavior or use a 
PD (proportional-plus-derivative) feedback to control the 
chaotic motion observed in the AFM system. Accordingly, 
the present study investigates the dynamic behavior of an 
AFM probe tip using two numerical methods, namely the 
differential transformation method [6], [7] and the 
Runge-Kutta method and then characterizes the dynamic 
response of the system by reference to phase portraits, power 
spectra, Poincaré maps, and maximum Lyapunov exponent 
plots. Finally, the chaotic behavior in the AFM system is 
identified using bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement 
and tip velocity, respectively and a PD controller included 
proportional gain and derivative gain is applied to control this 
system.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents a mathematical model for the 
time-dependent motions of the microcantilever tip and 
describes the solution of this model using the differential 
transformation method. Section 3 compares and contrasts the 
numerical results obtained by the differential transformation 
method and the Runge-Kutta method for the dynamic 
response of the microcantilever tip at various proportional 
gains and derivative gains. Subsequently, the nonlinear 
dynamic behavior of the probe tip is analyzed by maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots and bifurcation diagrams, 
respectively. Finally, Section 4 draws some brief conclusions.

B. Situation 1 
In the first situation, the bifurcation parameter was chosen 
to be the Kp, and Kv=0. In the current study, Figs. 1 plot the 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively, taking Kp as the bifurcation parameter. 
Finally, Figs. 2(a)-2(f) present the maximum Lyapunov 
exponent of the microcantilever tip trajectory at Kp = -0.5, 
-0.47, -0.39, -0.32, -0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, respectively.  
Figs 1(a)(b) and 2(a) show that at lower values of Kp, i.e. Kp 
<-0.47, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip both 
exhibit a dynamic periodic response. As Kp is increased from 
-0.47 to -0.41, Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip 
displacement and the tip velocity perform chaotic motions. 
Fig. 2(b) presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp = 
-0.47 and proof the appearance of chaos. At Kp = -0.4, the 
chaotic motion is replaced by multi-subharmonic motion, as 
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). When Kp is increased over the 
interval -0.4≤Kp<-0.32, the tip response includes both 
multi-subharmonic and 4T-subharmonic motion. Fig. 2(c) 
presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp =-0.39(4T). 
However, at Kp =-0.32, the 4T-periodic motion is replaced by 
chaotic motion, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Thereafter, the chaotic 
motion changes its unstable state at Kp =-0.22 and is replaced 
by multi-subharmonic motion. In the range -0.22≤ Kp <0.1, 
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip displacement and 
the tip velocity perform 4 kinds of motions including T-, 3T-, 
4T-, and multi-subharmonic motions. Figs. 2(e)-2(h) present 
the maximum Lyapunov exponent corresponding to Kp = 
-0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, and the maps confirm the 
existence of multi-, 4T-, 3T-subharmonic and T-periodic 
behavior shown in the bifurcation diagrams.  
From the discussions above, it is clear that the dynamic 
response of the probe tip depends on the magnitude of Kp. The 
various motions performed by the tip as Kp increases from -2 
to 0.1 are summarized in Table 3.

D. Situation 3 
In order to analyze that the influence of both Kp and Kv, the 
case is restricted Kp ＜1 and Kv ＜A4 . Also, the PD feedback 
is used to control this system to avoid the chaotic motion 
appear. The bifurcation parameter was chosen to be the Kv at 
Kp =-0.45. 
Figs. 5(a)(b) and 6(a) show that at lower values of Kv, i.e. 
Kv <-0.1, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip 
both exhibit a dynamic periodic response. At Kv = -0.1, the 
T-periodic motion is replaced by chaotic motion, as shown in 
Figs. 5 and 6(b). When Kv is increased over the interval -0.1≤ 
Kv <0.13, the tip response is chaotic motion. Figs. 6(c) and 
6(d) present the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kv = 0 and 
0.02, respectively.

values of Kv : (a)-1.0, (b)-0.1, (c)0, and (d)0.02. 
 
It is known that if the tip of the AFM system operates in the 
state of aperiodic motion, the resulting broadband vibration 
with large amplitude will lead to a higher probability of 
fatigue failure of microcantilever and decrease the measure 
accuracy of the AFM system. At Kp =-0.45 and Kv =-0.1, the 
maximum Lyapunov exponent is positive and Poincaré map 
demonstrated a fractal structure. It shows that the trajectory of 
the tip displacement is in a state of chaos. In order to 
eliminate the system operating in a no synchronous motion, a 
decreased derivative gain Kv =-0.1 is applied to control this 
system. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the tip dynamics leave 
the disorder state and turns to a periodic motion in the steady 
state after the derivative gain changes from -0.1 to -1.0.
