2Abstract
We discovered two different pearlites after two separate eutectoid reactions in a
Fe-20.0 Mn-0.50 C (wt%) steel. The pearlites are lamellae of ferrite + M3C and
lamellae of ferrite + M23C6, respectively. The steel was processed under solution
heat treatment at 1373 K and isothermal holding at temperatures from 1073 to 773 K.
The constituent phase of the steel is single austenite at temperatures between 1373
and 1023 K. M3C and M23C6 carbides precipitate at the austenitic grain boundaries
of the steel at temperatures below 973 K. In addition, at temperatures below 873 K,
two pearlites appear in the austenitic matrix simultaneously after two separate
eutectoid reactions. The eutectoid reactions are as follows: austenite  ferrite +
M3C and austenite  ferrite + M23C6. The austenite decomposed into two different
pearlitic systems of lamellae, i.e. one system of lamellae of ferrite and M3C and the
other system of lamellae of ferrite and M23C6. Therefore, we found the co-existence
of two different pearlites in the high manganese steel.
Key words: M23C6 carbide, high manganese steel, eutectoid reaction, pearlite.
4parameters of M3C carbide are adopted as a = 0.4524, b = 0.5089, and c = 0.6743
nm [12].
Another pearlite with the lamellae of ferrite and M23C6 carbide has been
found in the Cr and Mn-Al steels [6,14]. The lamellar M23C6 plates replaced the
M3C plates and embedded in the ferritic grains of the pearlite. Thus, another
eutectoid reaction features the decomposition of the austenite into ferrite and M23C6
carbide, i.e.  + M23C6 in the alloy steels. A well-known K-S orientation
relationship exists between the layer ferrite and M23C6 (C6) grains, i.e. (110) //
(111)C6 and [111] // [011]C6. The close packed planes of the ferrite are parallel to
the closest packed planes of the FCC M23C6 carbide, and the closest packed
direction of ferrite is parallel to that of M23C6 carbide [14].
When steels containing more or less carbon than the eutectoid composition
are cooled slowly or isothermally held below the eutectoid temperature, the
formation of pearlite is usually preceded by the precipitation of proeutectoid
cementite or ferrite, respectively, at the austenitic grain boundaries prior to the
eutectoid reaction [1]. In the eutectoid reaction of high manganese steels, the
partitioning of Mn and C solutes has been discovered in the pearlitic lamellae. The
M3C carbide contains a high concentration of Mn and C, and the ferrite has a low
concentration of Mn and C [15-16].

Samples were sectioned, mechanically polished and etched in a 5% nital
solution for observation in an optical microscope. Some of the samples were also
examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a RIGAKU DMAX-B x-ray diffractometer
operated at a maximum power of 12 kW. Samples used for observation in a
transmission electron microscope (TEM) were mechanically polished into thin foils
about 80 m in thickness, punched into circles with a diameter of 3 mm, and then
electro-polished using a twin jet polisher in a 10% HClO4 and 90% CH3COOH
solution. The TEM samples were examined in a JEOL JEM 2010 transmission
electron microscope equipped with a Link ISIS 300 Energy Dispersive X-ray
analyzer (EDS) operated at 200 kV.
Results and discussion
Figure 1(a) shows an optical micrograph (OM) of the high manganese steel
after being heated at 1373 K and quenched in water at room temperature. There are
lots of irregularly long and thin plates distributed in the matrix. The XRD analysis of
the steel with the same heat treatment as Fig. 1(a) is shown in Fig. 1(b). Some peaks,
with Miller indexes underlined, come from FCC phase and the others from HCP
phase. Thus, we confirmed that the matrix is FCC, austenite, and the irregular plate
8precipitate in Fig. 3(a) is the orthorhombic M3C carbide, the well-known cementite.
The zone-axis of the cementite as the SAD shows in Fig. 3(b) is along the [100]
direction. The lattice constants of the orthorhombic M3C carbide are a = 0.458, b =
0.510, and c = 0.668 nm. Besides the M3C carbide, we further verified that another
precipitate has the crystal structure of FCC, and is confirmed as the FCC M23C6
carbide. Fig. 3(c) shows the M23C6 carbide appears at the austenitic grain boundary
of the steel. The accompanying SAD from the [011] M23C6 carbide and its
neighboring [011] austenitic matrix is shown in Fig. 3(d). The lattice constant of the
FCC M23C6 carbide is a = 1.040 nm. Note that a cubic to cubic orientation
relationship exists between the M23C6 carbide and the austenitic matrix in the SAD.
This orientation relationship is frequently discovered for the precipitation of the
M23C6 carbide in the austenitic steels, such as Cr steels [6]. We further found that the
grain size of the M23C6 carbide is, on average, much bigger than that of the M3C
carbide from the TEM observation.
No precipitates appear in the austenite at 1073 K as shown in Fig. 2(a), and
only a small number of grain boundary precipitates distributed at the austenitic grain
boundary of the steel at 973 K as the OM shows in Fig. 2(b). The upper temperature
limit for the formation of M3C and M23C6 carbides at the austenitic grain boundaries
is just above 973 K. Therefore, we concluded that the grain boundary precipitates
10
in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) is the BF showing the lamellar structure of the low-temperature
phases. After analyzing the SADs of the lamellar phases, we confirmed that the
lamellae are the conventional pearlite comprising ferrite and M3C carbide. Fig. 5(b)
is the accompanying SAD from the [113 ] ferrite and [100] M3C carbide. Note that a
new orientation relationship between the ferrite and M3C carbide has been
discovered as follows: (110) // (031)C and [11 3 ] // [100]C. This orientation
relationship between the ferrite and the cementite in steels has never been previously
reported in the literature. Thus, it is a new orientation relationship between the
ferrite and the cementite, and suggests another way for the accommodation of M3C
carbide embedded in ferritic grains of the pearlitic colonies.
Besides the conventional pearlite comprising ferrite and M3C, we discovered
another new pearlite in the high manganese steel. Fig. 5(c) shows the BF of the new
pearlite comprising lamellae of the ferrite and M23C6 carbide, and Fig. 5(d) is the
accompanying SAD from the [111] ferrite and [011] M23C6 carbide. Note that an
orientation relationship exists between the BCC ferrite and FCC M23C6 carbide, i.e.
(110) // (111)C6 and [111] // [011]C6. It is the well-known K-S orientation
relationship between BCC and FCC crystals [1,14]. The lamellae of the product
ferrite and M23C6 phases in the high manganese steel are the new pearlite which is
similar to the conventional pearlite in steels. In the following text, we use M3C
12
higher than the eutectoid temperatures, for example, for the M3C and M23C6 carbides
shown in Fig. 3.
From the preceding analyses, we concluded that after the isothermal holding
of the steel at temperatures below 873 K, two different pearlitic systems form in the
austenitic matrix; i.e. one system of lamellae of ferrite and M23C6 carbide, and the
other system of lamellae of ferrite and M3C carbide. The BF in Fig. 5(e) illustrates
the co-existence of these two different pearlites in the same austenitic grain. The
micrograph in Fig. 5(e) is assembled from several BFs showing various pearlites in
one austenitic grain. One of the M23C6 pearlites is located at the left side and the
M3C pearlite is at the right side of the micrograph as the labels show in Fig. 5(e). In
the central region of the micrograph in Fig. 5(e), an unidentified pearlite exists.
Since the unidentified pearlite contains the carbide with roughly the same size as
that of M23C6 pearlite at the left side of the micrograph in Fig. 5(e), it is most likely
the M23C6 pearlite.
During the isothermal holding of the steel at temperatures below 873 K,
some austenite in the high manganese steel decomposed into ferrite and M23C6
carbide. This is characteristic of the different eutectoid transformation as follows: 
+ M23C6. So far, no study we are aware of in the literature reports the different
eutectoid transformation in high manganese steels. This eutectoid reaction has only
14
for the high manganese steel. No evidence for the precipitation of the proeutectoid
ferrite has been found in the high manganese steel prior to the eutectoid
transformation. Instead of the ferritic precipitate, two different carbides precipitate at
the austenitic grain boundaries of the high manganese steel at temperatures above
the eutectoid temperature as shown in Figs. 2(b) to (d). Since the M3C and M23C6
are proeutectoid carbides prior to the eutectoid reactions, the specimen steel belongs
to the hypereutectoid group of steels. The reason for the change in the carbon
concentration of the eutectoid reaction might be the high alloy concentration of Mn
in the steel.
We analyzed the chemical compositions (wt%) of the constituent phases
which include carbides at 873 K and pearlites at 823 K by means of EDS equipment
in the TEM. Due to carbon contamination on the surface area of the TEM specimen,
all the carbon signals shown in the EDS are neglected. The chemical compositions
of both carbides in the steel at 873 K are as follows. The M23C6 is Fe-33.6 Mn, and
the M3C is Fe-26.9 Mn. The chemical compositions of the constituent phases in the
pearlites of the steel at 823 K are as follows. Ferrite is Fe-3.2 Mn, M23C6 is Fe-38.6
Mn, and M3C is Fe-30.7 Mn. The ferritic grains in both pearlites contain similar low
Mn contents. Mn is an austenite stabilizer; therefore, it is reasonable that the
composition of the ferrite in the lamellae is low in Mn. Note that the metallic
16
K is single austenite. The microstructure of the steel in the as-quenched condition is
the austenite with the martensitic plates. M3C and M23C6 carbides precipitate at the
austenitic grain boundaries simultaneously at temperatures below 973 K. The grain
size of the M23C6 carbide is usually much bigger than that of the M3C carbide. The
upper temperature limit for the precipitation of these two carbides is just above 973
K.
Two pearlites form after two separate eutectoid reactions in the austenitic
matrix at the same time at temperatures below 873 K. The eutectoid reactions are as
follows:  + M3C and  + M23C6. The austenite decomposed into two
different pearlitic systems, i.e. one system of lamellae of ferrite + M3C and the other
system of lamellae of ferrite + M23C6. The morphologies of both pearlites are similar.
The lamellae of the product ferrite and M23C6 phases in the high manganese steel are
the new pearlite which is similar to the conventional pearlite in steel. Therefore, we
found the co-existence of two different pearlites from separate eutectoid reactions in
the high manganese steel.
From the M3C pearlite, a new orientation relationship was discovered
between the ferrite and M3C carbide, i.e. (110)// (031)C and [113 ]// [100]C. This
orientation relationship between the ferrite and the cementite has, previously, never
been reported in the literature. Thus, it is a new orientation relationship between the
