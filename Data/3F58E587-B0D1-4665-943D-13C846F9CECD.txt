[4], Elsayed and Teresi [5], Mak [15], Kang and Kim [9], and Heng et al.[8] continued 
to refine the model. 
There are a number of studies that incorporate the perspectives of both the buyer 
and the supplier. Goyal [7] first introduced the idea of joint total cost for the buyer 
and the supplier. Chakravarty and Martin [1] derived the optimal order period and 
discount price with joint minimum cost for the buyer and the supplier. Kao [10] 
considered both the perspectives of buyer and the supplier for deteriorating inventory 
with a constant exponential rate. Susan et al. [18] considered the cooperative and the 
non-cooperative situation, and obtained an optimal order price and quantity for each 
case. Kim and Ha [11] developed an integrated inventory model with JIT concepts 
and small lot size to derive the minimal joint total cost. Chou [2] developed an 
integrated two-stated inventory model for deterioration items, his research results 
shows that the cooperative strategy of the buyer and the supplier results in higher 
profit. 
Pan and Liao [16] implemented the JIT concept of small lot size to derive the 
optimal solution. Their research showed that the use of JIT concept is worth pursuing. 
Larson [14] modified the model by Pan and Liao [16] and considered the 
transportation cost, the receiving cost, and the quality control cost for small size 
deliveries. Kim and Ha [12] applied the small size deliveries concept from the 
perspectives of both the buyer and the supplier. Kim and Ha [12] extended the 
research to consider the perspectives of both the supplier and the buyer in a JIT 
environment. Later, Wee and Jong [19] applied the concept of multiple deliveries and 
developed an optimal deterioration production strategy. Lin [13] considered the 
perspectives of both the buyer and supplier, and applied a single order and multiple 
deliveries in model development. Wu [20] extended the research to consider the 
deterioration inventory. Yang and Wee [21] developed an integrated deterioration 
inventory model for both buyer and vendor, but they simplified the problem formation 
by assuming continuous demand. In this paper, our model assumes discrete demand 
and deliveries. 
 
2. Assumption and notation 
The mathematical model developed in this paper is based on the following 
assumptions: 
(1) Planning period is known. 
(2) A single buyer and producer are assumed. 
(3) Both demand rate and production rate are deterministic and constant. 
(4) Production rate is greater than demand rate. 
(5) Deterioration rate is deterministic and constant.

3.1 The Buyer’s Inventory Model 
The buyer inventory model for deteriorating item with multiple lot-size 
deliveries can be depicted as in Figure 1.

The producer’s inventory quantity for the nth time is equal to the lot-size per delivery. 
From (11), (12) and (13), under the assumed conditions, can derive the lot size at

3.3 The integrated joint total cost 
The integrated joint total cost of the buyer and producer, TC is the sum of (5) and 
(15), .e. PB TCTCTC +=            (16) 
 
4. Numerical example 
Substituting the following parameters into the derived the buyer and producer 
inventory model for deteriorating items with multiple lot-size deliveries, a computer 
code is developed to derive the optimal solution. T =1 year, D = 12,000 units; A =$25;

The values of the joint total cost TC are not sensitive to buyer’s order cost A, 
slightly sensitive to θB、θp、F、HB 、PB 、HP 、PP, and very sensitive to D and P. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In the past, most researches only consider the viewpoint of either the buyer or the 
producer. In a competitive market environment, it is important to consider the 
perspectives of both the buyer and the supplier. This study develops an integrated 
inventory model of a deteriorating item in the supply chain with multiple lot-size 
deliveries to derive an optimal joint total cost. A computer code is developed to derive 
the optimal solution. A numerical example and sensitivity analyses are given to 
validate the results. This study shows that the optimal policy adopted by the integrated 
approach results in consistent lower joint total cost.
