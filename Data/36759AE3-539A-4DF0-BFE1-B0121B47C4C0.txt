Abstract
This study evaluates the effects of display
medium (tablet PC, paper-pencil), academic
major (design, technology major) and gender on
visuospatial ability tests, visuospatial short-term
memory test, visual fatigue, subjective
preference and mental workload. Sixty
university students participated in the study. The
results indicate that the display medium had a
significant effect on all measurements (p<0.001).
When using a paper-pencil test, the visuospatial
test performance was higher, visual fatigue and
mental workload were lower than using the
tablet PC test. The interaction effect of display
medium and academic major is significant on
visuospatial test performance. The design major
students performed better on visuospatial ability
test but worse on visuospatial short-term
memory test than technology major students
under the tablet PC test. The gender effect is not
significant on all measurements. When assessing
visuospatial ability using the tablet PC based
test, it should be noticed that the visuospatial
ability may be underestimated especial for male
testers or design major students.

1. Introduction
The visuospatial ability, imagining an
object’s shape while it is rotated and
remember the positions of objects and
including the cognitive processes of
perception, attention, memory, mental
imagery, and problem solving [6], is an
important ability for some professional tasks,
for example, medical students who are
learning anatomy [9]. Moreover, the
visuospatial ability test has been used for the
assessment of cognition ability in
neurodegenerative disease patients [1],
mental development in children [10] and
human intelligence [17]. The “nature” (the
biological differences, e.g. gender) and
“nurture” (environmental factors which lead
to the differences, e.g. education) factors
would affect the visuospatial ability
3substance that may possibly affect the test
results. All subjects had no previous
experience using a tablet PC.
2.2 Experimental design
2.2.1 Independent variables
This study employed a nested factorial
design. The independent variables included
gender, academic major (design and
technology) and display medium (tablet PC
and paper-pencil). The academic major was
nested within gender and subject was nested
within academic major and gender. Subjects
were requested to take both a tablet PC and
paper-pencil test.
2.2.2 Visuospatial short-term memory test
The visuospatial short-term memory
test is the arrow span task [22] (Fig. 2).
2.2.3 Visuospatial ability test
The visuospatial test battery includes
the space relation test [4], card rotation test
and hidden pattern test [8] as shown in Fig. 3.
In the space relation test as shown in (Fig.
3(A)), (Fig. 3(B)), (Fig. 3(C))
2.2.4 Visual fatigue, subjective preferences and
mental workload
To measure visual fatigue, the critical
flicker fusion (CFF) frequency and the
subjective eye fatigue were evaluated. As for
subjective eye fatigue evaluation, the Borg
CR-10 scale [5] was used. The Borg CR-10
scale is a 10-point scale, with 0 denoting
‘nothing at al’ and 10denoting ‘almost 
maximal’.
The subjective mental workload was
assessed by using the NASA Task Load
Index (NASA-TLX) [11].
2.3 Experiment Procedure
A standard classroom computer desk and chair
were used for experimentation. Prior to the
experiment,
3. Results
The summarized ANOVA results are
shown in Table 1. The test display medium
had a significant effect on all measurements
(p<0.05 or better). Table 2 shows the
corresponding mean values of all
measurements for display media, academic
majors and gender. As can be seen in the
table, the average arrow span task scores for
the paper-pencil test and tablet PC test are
78.43 and 72.47, respectively. In other words,
the tablet PC test score is about 8% lower
than that for the paper-pencil test. The
answer time for the arrow span task for the
tablet PC is about 22% longer than those the
paper-pencil tests.
The average score of the space relation
task is 38 for the paper-pencil test and is 24
for the tablet PC test. The test score with the
tablet PC test is about 58% lower than for
the paper-pencil test. The tendency of test
card rotation and hidden patterns task scores
are similar to that for the space relation task.
The card rotation and hidden patterns task
scores for the tablet PC test are about 26%
and 33% lower than for the paper-pencil test,
respectively.
The increase in CFF change after the
tablet PC test is 1.74 Hz which is about 0.98
Hz greater than for the paper-pencil test.
Moreover, the subjective eye fatigue rating
for the tablet PC test is about 65% higher
than that of the paper-pencil test. The mean
value for the subjective preference for the
5were similar, there are still some differences.
For the table PC test, the subject had to click
on an icon to go to the next page, whereas in
the paper-pencil test the subject only had to
turn to the next page. Additional mental
resources are needed to manipulate the tablet
PC resulting in a visual imagery translation
processing delay and visuospatial ability
decreasing.
The industrial design students
performed better than the technology major
group on the space relation task, where
spatial visualization was required [12]. This
further supports the notion of undergraduate
programs improving specific abilities, such
as visuospatial processing, exemplified as
perspective taking and looking at mental
objects from different angles, which are
strategies that are used in the space relation
task. Thus, spatial visualization might have
been performed well in the design student
group. However, the effect of academic
major was not significant on card rotation
task and hidden patterns task in the study.
Compare with space relation task, the card
rotation task and hidden patterns task are
simpler [17] and the visuospatial ability
training is also included in undergraduate
programs of technology major [24]. Thus,
the performance of card rotation task and
hidden patterns task were similar for both
academic groups.
For gender effect, the current study
found no difference between the
performance of males and females on
visuospatial ability, which is consistent with
the finding reported by Loring-Meier and
Halpern [15] and Weiss et al. [26]. It could
be explain by the interaction between
academic major and gender. Academic
training with more visuospatial related task
practice, benefited females more than males
and, as a result, reduced the original gender
differences in performance [20]. More
interesting finding was that under tablet-PC
test, the space relation task score for male
was lower than female, but the CFF change
was greater for male students than female
students (Fig. 6). Kang et al. [13] also
reported that female subjects had less eye
fatigue than male subjects while reading the
electronic book. Thus, males’ eye fatigue 
increased more easily than females’ and 
resulted in visuospatial ability decreased
greatly.
In conclusion, the current findings
show that the display medium effect is more
significant than academic major and gender
effects. The visuospatial ability test was
better administered with paper-pencil than
with a tablet PC. This would underestimate
the visuospatial ability when using the
Tablet PC, especial for male or design major
students. An improvement in PC display
quality is needed to increase performance
and preference in the visuospatial ability
test.
