friction coefficient was measured from a three-particle sliding test, 
whilst the inter-particle friction coefficient was measured from a test 
of repose angle. The particle-wall and inter-particle restitution 
coefficients were determined from a drop test. The transport 
properties (i.e. the local average velocity, local fluctuation velocity, 
granular temperature, fluctuation velocity distribution and self-
diffusion coefficient) were evaluated. The comparison between 
DEM simulations and experiments was made and discussed in this 
report. The majority showed good to excellent match, providing a 
quantitative validation for the DEM simulation of the problem 
studied. The main conclusions are as follows: 
(1) Both the experiment and the DEM simulation have shown that 
particle rotation does play a significant role in the vibrated granular 
bed, rotated granular drum and sheared granular cell. This 
phenomenon may not be observed by the traditional PTV technique, 
which can not measure the particle rotation. 
(2) Although most of the DEM predicted transport properties gave 
plausible match with experimental results, the rest produced larger 
discrepancies. These discrepancies need to be further investigated 
by exploring the influence of the particle scale (micro) parameters 
on the bulk scale (macro) responses.

explored the diffusion of a grain pulse in a horizontal rotating drum through discrete element 
simulations. They found that the self-diffusion of spherical grains is normal and that the diffusion 
coefficient is independent of the grain size. Chou and Lee [12] investigated cross-sectional and 
axial flow behaviours of dry granular material in rotating drums by flow imaging analysis. In their 
study, the dimensionless granular temperature exhibits linear distribution in the flowing layer, being 
maximum at the free surface and being negligible at the interface in the rolling regime. 
Elliott et al. [13] experimentally studied the rapid flow behaviour of spherical glass beads in a 
two-dimensional annular Couette flow apparatus. They reported that the resulting mean velocity 
profiles have a roughly linear variation across the test section and that the root-mean-square 
fluctuation velocities are roughly constant, with the streamwise fluctuation larger than that in the 
transverse direction. Hsiau and Shieh [14] employed the PTV and investigated the influence of solid 
fraction on the fluctuation and self-diffusion of sheared granular flows in a shear cell device. They 
reported that the velocity fluctuation and self-diffusion are anisotropic with greater components in 
the stream wise direction and that the flow rheology is very sensitive to the mean solid fraction of 
the granular flow. Jasti and Higgs [15] explored the influence of wheel rough surface and angular 
velocity on flows of spherical granule in a two-dimensional annular shear cell by conducting shear 
experiments. Their experimental results indicate two distinct regions in the steady-state: a 
high-velocity and dilute-gas-like kinetic region near the moving wall and a high-solid-fraction 
liquid-like frictional flow regime away from the moving wall. They also reported that the 
normalized slip near the moving wall decreases with increasing wall roughness and decreasing wall 
rotation rate. Wang and Zhou [16] performed DEM simulations to investigate the influence of the 
packing fraction on the shape of mean tangential velocity profile in a 2D annular dense shear 
granular flow. Their numerical results indicate a critical packing fraction that distinguishes between 
two different flow regimes. For the packing fraction less than the critical value, the mean tangential 
velocity profile shows a roughly exponential decay from the shearing boundary and is almost 
invariant to the imposed shear rate. However, for the packing fraction greater than the critical value, 
the tangential velocity profile exhibits a rate-dependence feature and changes from linear to 
nonlinear gradually with the increasing shear rate. 
Most experimental and numerical studies have focused on the dynamic behaviour of spherical 
particles in the last few decades. There have been relatively fewer papers studying non-spherical 
particulate systems although most real particles in industrial applications are not spheres. There is 
thus a need to explore the flow behaviour of non-spherical particulate systems. The aim of this 
project is to investigate the quasi-2D flow behaviour of non-spherical particles subject to different 
loading conditions by using physical experiment and DEM simulation. The loading conditions 
include vibration tests, rotation tests and shear tests. We validated the DEM results against the 
corresponding experimental results. The non-spherical particles used in this study were POM paired 
particles, composed of two single beads. In the experiment, the improved PTV technique was 
applied to measure translational and rotational velocities for non-spherical particles. In the discrete 
element modeling, the Hertz-Mindlin no-slip contact model was adopted to model particle collision

Figure 3 shows the shear test setup that was designed to investigate the flow behaviour of 
granular materials in an annular shear cell. The experimental setup mainly consists of two driving 
motors and a quasi-2D shear cell. One of the two motors controls the inner wheel and the other 
drives the outer ring. The two motors can be independently tuned to give the prescribed angular 
velocity to shear the granular solids. The non-spherical particles used in the test were also POM 
paired particles, as used in the rotation test. There were 910 POM paired particles (819 black paired 
particles and 91 white paired particles) filled in the shear cell. These white paired particles 
constituted 10% of the total particles. The shear cell had an inner diameter of 105 mm and an outer 
diameter of 150 mm. Its top face plate was also made of transparent glass for optical purpose. The 
thickness of the shear cell was also 1.1 times single bead diameter, so the particulate system 
constitutes a quasi-2D representation.

be made in the first image. The bi-cubic interpolation method (Sonka et al. [18]) is used to increase 
the accuracy during image rotation. A total of 16 neighboring points are used for interpolation, as 
shown in Fig. 6. The one-dimensional interpolation kernel function ch  is given in Eq. (5).

The DEM calculation was performed using the PFC3D code [22]. Input parameters for the 
circular disks and paired particles are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. The circular disks 
and paired particles were made of Polyformaldehyde (POM). The Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio 
and density for the paired particles were taken from Gere and Timsohenko [24]. A drop test 
apparatus was devised to determine the particle-wall and particle-particle restitution coefficients. 
The particle-wall static friction coefficient was measured from a three-particle sliding test, whilst 
the particle-particle friction coefficient was measured from a repose angle test.

The mean square diffusive displacements ( ( )xx SS Δ×Δ , ( )yy SS Δ×Δ  and ( )yx SS Δ×Δ ) and 
rotation ( ( )RR Δ×Δ ) were also averaged from 36 tracer particles taken from 4001 frames. Figure 13 
shows the mean square diffusive displacements for the experiment and DEM simulation. Both 
results match reasonably and all show that the mean square diffusive displacements increased with 
diffusive time and that their trends are close to linear. The diffusive behaviours here are similar to 
those in a spherical particulate system (Tai and Hsiau [2] and Wildman et al. [25]). The 
self-diffusion coefficients can be determined from Fig. 13 by using linear regression. The 
self-diffusion coefficients xxD , yyD  and xyD  from the experiment, corresponding to 
( )xx SS Δ×Δ , ( )yy SS Δ×Δ  and ( )yx SS Δ×Δ , are 0.099 cm2/s, 0.156 cm2/s and 0.083 cm2/s 
respectively, whilst the self-diffusion coefficients xxD , yyD  and xyD , are 0.102 cm
2/s, 0.129

In the rotation tests of POM paired particles, the filling fraction was 50%. The rotational speed 
of the drum was maintained at 4rpm with a steppermotor, which corresponds to the Froude number  
of 7.154×10-3 ( gRFr /2ω= , where ω is the angular velocity of the drum; R is the radius of the 
drum; and g is the gravitational acceleration). The same test condition was also applied in the DEM 
simulation. By dividing the domain including the drum into 40 rows x 40 columns giving 1600 
square sub-regions, spatial variations of the local velocity and granular temperature were evaluated. 
The size of each sub-region is 10 mm which is 1.25 times the major dimension of the paired 
particles. The local average velocities were averaged from 194 tracer particles of 1940 particles 
taken from 6001 frames in the experiment and DEM simulation. Figure 16 shows the local 
translational velocity vectors of the paired particles for the experiment and simulation. The DEM 
predicted translational velocity field reasonably matches with the measured one. Both results show 
that the flowing layer formed in the drum. Figure 17 shows the local rotational velocity field of the 
paired particles for both results. Both results show that the particles rotated violently in the flowing 
layer. It can be seen from Figs. 16 and 17 that these tracer particles not only translated but also 
rotated in the drum. The granular temperature distribution of the entire drum for the experiment and 
simulation is shown in Fig. 18. The DEM predicted granular temperature reasonably matches with 
the measured one. The larger granular temperature indicates that the particle flow is more excited 
and more fluidized. Both results show that the motion in the flowing layer was more fluidized and 
more excited.

The DEM predicted fluctuation velocity distributions are in good agreement with those from the 
experiment. Both results show that the fluctuation velocity distributions are close to the Maxwellian 
distribution.

The mean square diffusive displacements ( ( )xx SS Δ×Δ , ( )yy SS Δ×Δ  and ( )yx SS Δ×Δ ) and 
rotation ( ( )RR Δ×Δ ) were also averaged from 194 tracer particles taken from 6001 frames. Figure

energy had a mean value of 91 cm2/sec2. The average rotational kinetic energy from the test had a

of 3 cm2/sec2. The rotational component thus constitutes approximately 13.9% and 3.3% of the 
average kinetic energy for the experiment and simulation respectively. The DEM simulation 
underestimates the kinetic energy and particle rotation of the granular system and this should be 
further investigated.

In the shear tests of POM paired particles, the filling fraction of the granular materials was 
78%. The rotational speed of the outer ring was maintained at 4rpm, whereas the inner wheel was 
fixed. The corresponding DEM simulation was conducted with the same test condition. By dividing 
the shear cell into 10 layers along the radial direction, spatial variations of the local velocity were 
evaluated. The size of each layer is 4.5 mm which is 1.125 times the minor dimension of the paired 
particles. The local average velocities were averaged from 91 tracer particles of 910 particles taken 
from 5998 frames in the experiment and DEM simulation. Figure 23 (a) shows the local radial 
velocity of the paired particles along the radial position for the experiment and simulation, whereas 
Fig. 23 (b) shows the local circumferential velocity along the radial position. The DEM predicted 
circumferential velocity reasonably matches with the measured one, whilst the DEM predicted 
radial velocity seems to be much smaller than the measured one. This discrepancy should be further 
investigated.

Outcome self-assessment  
We have finished this project. The following main achievements have been obtained. 
(1) The developed improved PTV technique has been successfully applied to measure the 
translational and rotational velocities of spherical and non-spherical particles in a vibrating bed, 
a rotating drum and a shear cell. This developed technique is also applicable to any 
irregularly-shaped particles. The feasibility and application of this developed technique to 
different loading scenarios have been proven in this project. 
(2) The role of particle rotation in the systems studied here has been explored, which provides a 
basis for the theoretical development. 
(3) The developed discrete element model for the vibrated granular bed, rotated granular drum and 
shear granular cell has been validated and can be applied to industrial problems.
