摘要 
Photoelastic analyses have been successfully 
conducted by several researchers and many 
equations based on digital images were 
presented. Although these equations were all 
derived using the light intensity emitted 
from the analyzer, pixel values of the digital 
image were actually used in the real 
calculations. In this paper, we proposed that 
relative light intensity should be used 
instead for more accurate photoelastic 
analysis. Real isochromatic images were 
generated based on relative light intensity as 
well as pixel value. The analysis showed 
that the proposed approach can obtain better 
result than that of the previous method.

function; Polarizer; isochromatic images 
 
1. 前言及研究目的 
Measurement of photoelasticity is an 
important experimental method for knowing 
the stress in material. In the past, even 
though researchers can see the isoclinics and 
isochromatics, it was difficult to obtain light 
intensity emitted from every part of the test 
object; people were hardly to know the 
detail of whole-field stress direction. 
Besides, it took a cumbersome process to 
find the phase map of isoclinics and makes 
users dread to use this technology. However, 
more and more tiny component is 
manufactured for many size dwindled 
equipment, many manufacturers need to 
know the inner situations of the component 
in order to control the production conditions. 
For example, in the cell phone and digital 
camera, there are small lenses for 
photographing; lens manufacturers are 
looking forward to determine the stress 
inside this tiny lens because of its influences 
on image quality. They need to understand 
what happened inside the lens not only the 
shape but also stresses that makes the 
refraction of light different from the 
aspiration of designer. Obviously, a correct 
quantity answer of stress distribution for the 
manufacturer is necessary, and photoelastic 
technique is still a convenient optics method 
for stress analysis. 
 
 
2. 文獻探討 
With the advancement in computer 
system, digital image processing (DIP) has 
become a powerful technology of analyzing 
photoelastic images in yielding full field 
information of stress. In many studies, 
isochromatics and isoclinics have been 
investigated by many researchers for 
photoelastic analysis [1-5]. These two types 
of images are the major patterns found in the 
photoelastic measurement. While it is very 
straightforward to obtain a pure 
isochromatics image without the 
interference of isoclinic lines, there is no 
simple optical configuration can capture a 
pure isoclinic image without isochromatics 
inside it in a single shot. 
One way to get a pure isoclinic image is 
to combine two or more images by using 
phase-shifting technology [6]. Even though 
an isochromatic image can be captured by a 
circular polariscope, it still needs 
multi-images and further image processing 
to obtain the phase map because of the 
background light of the polarizer [1]. 
Phase-shifting method can derive phase 
maps for the isochromatic and isoclinic 
images and has been an important technique 
used in many studies [5]. 
The objective of the present study was to 
take the camera response function (CRF) 
 where s is the spatial constant of the whole 
imaging system. Then, the exposure X  on 
camera film can be written as t sIt EX ΔΔ == . 
Substitute Eq. (6) into Eq. (5), we have the 
equation for pixel value and analyzer’s 
intensity as 
 ( )tsIfZ Δ=  　 　 　 　 (7) 
 
Camera response function is usually 
nonlinear and unknown. The algorithm of 
finding response function is named high 
dynamic range imaging and requires the 
scene to be rather static. Fortunately, images 
of the photoelastic pattern can stay 
stationary during the measurement process 
for multiple exposures. Consequently, the 
HDRI technique will fit our application on 
photoelasticity satisfactorily.  
 
4.  研究方法 
The Eq. (3) shows that we can create an 
isochromatic image by combining two dark 
field images of a crossed-axes plane 
polariscope. In order to know how the 
advantageous is when we using response 
curve in analyzing photoelastic digital 
images. Two different combining methods 
are used as follows: 
 
4.1 The first method 
In former studies, pixel value had 
displaced relative light intensity emerging 
from the analyzer onto the CCD array, that 
means the response function was a simple 
linear function. Here we write down this 
algorithm in DIP representation way as  
( )α-β2sin

ΔsinItsktsIkXkZ 22P111 ⋅=== ΔΔ  (8) 
In this equation, 1k  is the constant of the 
linear relation, and we have substituted Eq. 
(1) into the linear response function. Let 
pixel value 0Z =β  and 
4
Z πβ=  to be the pixel 
values for the two dark field images of 0I =β  
and
4
I πβ = , following the Eq. (8), we 
represent them as

4.2 The second method 
If the response function of the camera 
using in experiments was known, images 
process can be done in intensity space as 
following steps: 
Transfer pixel values into relative 
intensities by using inverse response 
function. The mathematical representation 
calculated intensities  is

5. 結果 
There were two systems for this 
experiment. The first arrangement was as in 
Fig. 1, we rotated polarizer and analyzer 
simultaneously, in which we had an images 
that is described by Eq. (1).  Applying the

(英文) Studies on photoelasticity have been conducted by many researchers in recent years, and 
many equations for photoelastic analysis based on digital images were proposed. While 
these equations were all presented by the light intensity emitted from the analyzer, pixel 
values of the digital image were actually used in the real calculations. In this paper, a 
proposal of using relative light intensity obtained by 
the camera response function to replace the pixel value for photoelastic analysis was 
investigated. 
Generation of isochromatic images based on relative light intensity and pixel value were 
compared 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the new approach. The results showed that when relative 
light intensity 
was used, the quality of an isochromatic image can be greatly improved both visually and 
quantitatively. 
We believe that the technique proposed in this paper can also be used to improve the 
performance for the other types of photoelastic analysis using digital images.
