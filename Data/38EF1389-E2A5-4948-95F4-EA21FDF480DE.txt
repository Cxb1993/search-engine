Abstract 
Nowadays businesses around the world are attempting to position themselves to operate in a 
highly competitive marketplace. Most enterprises are looking for their suppliers to work together 
as their partners to strength their competitions under current supply chain management (SCM) 
strategy. SCM becomes a key strategy for most enterprises. Enterprises can increase their supply 
chain competition by using selecting excellent suppliers to develop collaborative relationships 
with suppliers by cutting supplier lists and treating the remaining suppliers as allies, thus supplier 
selecting and reducing the supplier base has become a priority and an important goal for some 
firms in SCM. This article integrates an extended association rule algorithm and Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) to enable a selection and reduction in the number of suppliers and find 
the best key suppliers. An example of finding the key suppliers of SCM in an electronic devices 
manufacturer in Taiwan is described for its effectiveness. 
Keywords: Data Mining, Association Rules, Analytic Hierarchy Process, Supplier Relationship

association rule is used to discover certain association relationships among a set of objects in a 
database and the set theory is used to provide a quantitative, numerical measure of classification 
approximation and deals with information which can be represented in the concept of the space to 
discover the value of relationships based on every part. The second approach uses a Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate each supplier performance based on the history transaction 
record. The AHP approach will look for the appropriate suppliers to form a group which will be 
considered primary suppliers. Several criteria (factors) which have effects on the selection of 
suppliers are considered in a given period, such as, cost, quality, and due date.  
 
三、 文獻探討 
The field of data mining has emerged as a new method in business, engineering and 
computer science. Data mining comprises a number of techniques, such as clustering, 
classification, association rules, prediction, regression, and neural networks. One of the important 
problems in data mining is the association rule that implies certain association relationships 
among a set of objects in a database. Agrawal et al. (1993) introduced association rules to the data 
mining community. There has been a marked tendency to extend the association rule in a wider 
variety of problems of academia and practitioners with applications, such as customer 
relationship management (CRM), market baskets analysis (MBA), economic and financial 
time-series analysis, production process, are manufacturing diagnosis (Agrawal et al., 1993; 
Houtsma and Swami, 1993; Agrawal and Srikant, 1994; Mannila et al.,1994; Park et al., 1995; 
Holsheimer et al., 1995; Savasere et al., 1995; Agrawal et al., 1996; Zaki and Hsiao, 1999; Chen 
et al., 2002). The association rule, based on the market basket analysis, is directed toward 
establishing “aggregate” customer behaviors to help managers determine, which items are 
frequently purchased together by customers. With an enormous amount of historical purchase 
data having been collected in databases, data mining tools can allow buyers collecting and 
analyzing such data to find buyer and supplier relationship for support further purchase decision 
making. 
The selection of an appropriate supplier can be important for a firm’s competitive advantage. 
Selecting the right suppliers can significantly improve corporate competitiveness. Selection of the 
wrong suppliers could cause many problems for the purchasing company such as operation, 
quality, cost, and so on. Thus, today’s fierce competitive environment and strong emphasis on 
efficient supply chain management entices companies to select appropriate suppliers. Some 
publications have addressed this issue in recent years to discuss the complexity of the supplier 
selection. The literature survey reveals that various methodologies have been suggested in linear 
programming, mixed integer programming and other quantitative approaches (Sharma et al., 1989; 
Weber and Current, 1993; Wang et al., 2003). On the other hand, various researchers have 
reported on the benefits of a systematic approach to supplier selection decision-making. Vokurka 
et al. (1996) develop an expert system that covers multiple phases in the supplier selection 
process, among which the formulation of supplier selection criteria. Some other different 
methodologies (Ghobadian et al., 1993; Timmerman, 1986; Narasimhan, 1983; De Boer et al. 
2001) for supplier selection have been proposed in the literature including linear weighted point, 
cost ratio, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA) and some others. 
In all of this research, the strongest emphasis is placed on the strategic factors that need to be 
considered in selecting suppliers.

4.1 Define the criteria for supplier selection: Define the important criteria, which create a 
decision hierarchy by breaking down the problem into a hierarchy of decision elements. Different 
companies have different specific requirements concerning supplier performance. Supplier 
selection processes differ depending upon a variety of factors. The primary criteria used in this 
paper to evaluate the performances of supplier are mainly included here as following: 
1. Cost is measured based on total cost and unit price in the firm’s supplier selection. 
2. Quality refers to the supplier to conform to the buying firm’s specifications which include 
the incoming process quality control (IPQC), in-process quality control (PQC), and 
customer’s rejection.  
3. Delivery refers to the ability of a supplier to meet delivery schedules and production 
support. 
4. Service refers to the supplier to provide after-sales service and engineering support. 
 The above primary elements in the hierarchy of criteria are decomposed into sub-criteria, the 
AHP hierarchy structure is constructed in Figure 3.

4.2 Rate the alternative suppliers: In many situations one may not be able to assign weights to 
the different decision factors. AHP will allow the estimation of the weights based upon multiple 
criteria. According to each criterion of supplier selection, the preference levels and the rating 
score are determined based on nine verbal judgments shown in Table 2. The suppliers are then 
analyzed by using the ratings scales with respect to each criterion. The rating levels of each 
supplier for each criterion can be determined based on the experts’ judgments. The use of the 
ratings-feature enables the analysis of numerous suppliers and makes it easy to add new suppliers 
to the evaluation process at any time.  
The detail algorithms of rate the alternative suppliers will be described in the following: 
1. Create a decision hierarchy and determine the relative importance of criteria. 
2. Collect input by a pairwise comparison of decision elements. 
3. Determine whether the input data satisfies a “Consistency Test”, if it does not, go back to 
Step 2 and redo the pairwise comparisons. 
4. Calculate the relative weights of the decision elements. 
5. Aggregate the relative weights to obtain scores and hence rankings for the decision

considered as secondary suppliers { 985 ,, SSS }. According to the algorithm for identifying

In supplier group 1, a set of four candidate suppliers is constructed. The set of alternatives 
consists of Suppliers 1, 2, 4, and 7. The supplier selection policy at the company is based on a 
subjective tradeoff among quality, price, delivery, and service of the different suppliers 
considered. Assuming that cost, quality, delivery and service are criteria, we can create a decision 
hierarchy, by breaking down the problem into a hierarchy of decision elements. The quality is the 
most important in all criteria, then cost, delivery, and service in a descending sequence. After 
calculation, the relative weights of the decision elements for cost, quality, service and delivery are 
equal to 0.191, 0.664, 0.092 and 0.053, respectively and checked their summation is equal to 1. 
Then, aggregate the relative weights to obtain scores and hence rankings for the decision 
alternatives. After applying the Expert Choice software, the relative overall scores of suppliers 1, 
2, 4, and 7 for item 1 are equal to 0.389, 0.095, 0.345 and 0.171, respectively. The Supplier 1 is 
the highest overall score with the priority of 0.389. Therefore, the key supplier for item 1 is 
Supplier 1. Supplier 4 is the second important with a priority of 0.345. 
After repeatedly applying AHP in Expert Choice 2000 for each item, the key supplier(s) for item
