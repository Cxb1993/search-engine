certain parameters using an LMI approach. In opposition
to try and error, the control gains in both speed loop and
current loop can be obtained systematically by solving the
corresponding LMIs.
(2) Diﬀerently from the conventional PI controller, a
novel controller is proposed where a low-pass filter instead
of a pure integrator is proposed. By a suitable adjustment
for a design parameter, both the overshoot and the steady-
state error can be improved simultaneously.
(3) The speed controller and current controller are con-
sidered simultaneously using the proposed LMI approach.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The model
description is presented in Section II. In Section III, prob-
lem formulation and its solution are presented. In Section
IV, simulation examples are provided. Finally, concluding
remarks are made in Section VI.

where K2 is some positive constant (control gain) to be

Remark 4: The transfer function from eds (or eqs or e)
to edsI (or eqsI or eI) is 1s+κ which is a low-pass filter. The
behavior of a low-pass filter is similar to a pure integrator
at high frequency. Moreover, the behavior of a low-pass

The main objective of this study is to determine the
control gains K1 ∼ K6 in (11) and (15) such that the
closed-loop system in (25) with the adaptive laws in (19)-
(20) is stable. Let us consider the following candidate of

where ρ is also called adaptation gain, then
V˙ = ηT (A˜T + A˜)η (29)
If the control gains K1 ∼ K6 are chosen properly such that
A˜T + A˜ < 0 (30)
then
V˙ ≤ 0 (31)
which guarantees that the closed loop system in (25) with
the adaptive laws in (19)-(20) is stable in the sense of Lya-
punov.
Remark 8: Although, the stability of the closed-loop sys-
tem is guaranteed for any adaptation gain ρ, the perfor-
mance of the adaptive laws depends critically on ρ. If a
small gain is chosen, the adaptation will be slow and the
transient error will be large. Conversely, the magnitude of
the gain should be limited because too large an adaptation
gain will lead to very oscillatory parameters [15].
In the rest of this section, the procedure is developed to
determine K1 ∼ K6 in terms of LMI formulation such that
the closed loop system in (25) is stable. It is clear that
the uncertain (interval) matrix A˜ in (30) is function of four
uncertain parameters, i.e., A˜ = A˜(R˜s, L˜s, λ˜f , B˜m), and can
be characterized in terms of the following sixteen (24 = 16)
vertex (or corner) matrices [16]
A˜ =
16[
i=1
αiAi (32)
where A1 = A˜(R+s , L
+

+

+

−
f , B
−
m) and
16S
i=1
αi = 1 with 0 ≤
αi ≤ 1 (i = 1, ..., 16).
Remark 9: In this study, the exact values of αi are not
required.
From the formulation for uncertain matrix A˜ in (32), the
stable condition in (30) is equivalent to
16[
i=1
αi(ATi +Ai) < 0 (33)
Obviously, a suﬃcient condition for (33) being satisfied
is that the following linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
ATi +Ai < 0 (34)
hold for all i = 1, . . . , 16.
From the analysis above, the problem of determining the
control gainsK1 ∼ K6 can be formulated in term of solving
the LMIs in (34) for all i = 1, . . . , 16.
Remark 10: The LMIs problem (LMIP) in (34) can be
eﬃciently solved by the LMI toolbox in Matlab [14].
Remark 11: A necessary condition for ATi +Ai < 0 being
satisfied is that all diagonal entries of Ai should be nega-
tive. This is the reason why three error dynamics for edsI ,
eqsI , and eI are defined as that in (5)-(7), which are all
low-pass filters instead of pure integrators. By the asser-
tion in (5)-(7), the diagonal entries of Ai at (1, 1), (3, 3),
and (5, 5) are −κ which is negative and thus some feasible
solutions for the LMIs in (34) may be possibly obtained
by this arrangement. In other words, if pure integrator
scheme, κ = 0, is adopted for edsI , eqsI , and eI defined in
(5)-(7), then the diagonal entries of Ai at (1, 1), (3, 3), and
(5, 5) are all zero and obviously no feasible solutions for the
LMIs in (34) can be found. Note that (34) is only a suf-
ficient condition for the stability of the closed-loop system
in (25). However, it does not guarantee that there always
exist the control gains K1 ∼ K6 such that LMIs in (34)
hold.
Remark 12: From the stability analysis in this section,
it does not guarantee that all error states including esti-
mated errors can approach zero asymptotically, but it does
guarantee that all error states are bounded. However, the
steady-state errors for e, eds, and eqs can approach zero by
a suitable adjustment for the parameter κ, which is shown
in the next section. Although, bounded estimated errors
are guaranteed, as well-known, the convergence of the esti-
mated parameters is guaranteed only for the driving signal
Y with persistent excitation condition in the adaptive law
(28). However, the persistent excitation condition for the
signal Y is diﬃcult to be verified in advance.

A novel formulation for the PMSM drive system is devel-
oped and by this formulation the stability condition for
the closed-loop PMSM drive system with the proposed con-
trollers can be characterized in terms of some linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs). The LMIs problem (LMIP) can be ef-
ficiently solved. Numerical solutions of the control gains
using the proposed LMI formulation and simulation exam-
ples are provided to illustrate the design procedure and
corresponding performances. In opposition to try and er-
ror, the control gains can be obtained systematically in this
study.

Remark 1: In this study, the parameters Rs, Ls, λf ,
Jm, and Bm are assumed to be uncertain constants or
slowly time-varying. Therefore, the lumped parameters
ωrLs = θ1 and ωrλf = θ2 are also considered to be un-
certain constants or slowly time-varying in the case that
ωr is fixed at some speed or slowly time-varying during
the sampling period. This assumption is valid in practi-
cal digital estimator because the sampling period of the
estimator is short enough compared with the variation of
ωr. The sampling period of the estimator is about 0.1ms
in practical applications. In additional, it is assumed that
Rs = Rs0 +∆Rs and Ls = Ls0 +∆Ls, where Rs0 and Ls0
are nominal values of Rs and Ls, respectively, and ∆Rs
and ∆Ls are uncertain constant terms of Rs and Ls, re-
spectively. In this study, ∆Rs is assumed to be uncertain
constants or slowly time-varying and the upper bound and
the lower bound of ∆Ls are assumed to be known. In other
words, ∆L−s ≤ ∆Ls ≤ ∆L+s , where the upper bound ∆L+s
and the lower bound ∆L−s are known.

The main objective of this study is to determine the
control gains K1 ∼ K6 in (12), (20), and (21) and estima-
tion gains K7 ∼ K8 in (5)-(6) such that the closed-loop
system in (30) is stable. Let us consider the following can-
didate of the Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system
in (30)

where ρ is some positive constant then its derivative can
be expressed as

where ρ is also called adaptation gain, then
V˙ = ηT (AT +∆AT +A+∆A)η (34)
If the control gains K1 ∼ K8 are chosen properly such that
AT +∆AT +A+∆A < 0 (35)
then
V˙ ≤ 0 (36)
which guarantees that the closed loop system in (30) is
stable in the sense of Lyapunov.
In the rest of this section, the procedure is developed to
determine K1 ∼ K8 in terms of LMI formulation such that
the closed loop system in (30) is stable. It is clear that
the uncertain (interval) matrix ∆A in (35) is function of
three uncertain parameters, i.e., ∆A = ∆A(∆Ls,∆λ,∆B),
and can be characterized in terms of the following sixteen
(23 = 8) vertex (or corner) matrices [12]
∆A =
8[
i=1
αi∆Ai (37)
where ∆A1 = ∆A(∆L+s ,∆λ+,∆B+), . . . , ∆A8 =
∆A(∆L−s ,∆λ−,∆B−) and
8S
i=1
αi = 1 with 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1
(i = 1, ..., 8).
Remark 6: In this study, the exact values of αi are not
required.
From the formulation for uncertain matrix ∆A in (37),
the stable condition in (35) is equivalent to
AT +A+
8[
i=1
αi(∆ATi +∆Ai) < 0 (38)
Obviously, a suﬃcient condition for (38) being satisfied
is that the following linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
AT +A+∆ATi +∆Ai < 0 (39)
hold for all i = 1, . . . , 8.
From the analysis above, the problem of determining the
control gains K1 ∼ K6 and estimation gains K7 ∼ K8 can
