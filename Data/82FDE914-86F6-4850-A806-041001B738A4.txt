Abstract 
Construction time matters for activities where rental equipment must be utilized. The 
building of a secant pile wall requires the rental of equipment and finding the optimal sequence to 
minimize the construction time is one way to lower construction costs. In this study we develop 
an effective and efficient optimization algorithm, which we call Self-Organizing Feather 
Map-based Optimization (SOMO), to minimize the construction time. The algorithm is applied to 
a case study to obtain the optimal sequences for both primary and secondary bored piles for a 
secant pile wall. The new SOMO algorithm is developed based on the ability of the human brain 
to produce topologically ordered mapping, so as to exploit better solutions via updating the 
weighting vectors of the neurons in a self-organizing topological way that occurs in the evolution 
of the feature map for optimization. Given detailed building time of the 16 activities of each 
bored pile, we find that 143.92 hours or 27.21% of the original construction can be saved. The 
optimal sequences for both primary and secondary bored piles are also determined. The 
practicability of the SOMO algorithm is substantiated.

Introduction 
The reduction of pollution, improvement of waterproofing, and lengthening of durability are 
three key factors in the selection of retaining walls. Most of the relatively simple and inexpensive 
types of retaining walls still suffer from the possible problems of air and noise pollution, damage 
 3
A secant pile wall is a type of retaining wall which can provide support for vertical or 
near-vertical grade change and effectively prevents the leaking of water. This type of wall is 
commonly used in heavy construction and infrastructure projects. Studies have been done 
regarding concrete strength of the secant pile wall during boring and cutting (Suckling 2005), the 
problem of borehole enlargement in alluvium (Zhou et al 2006), the feasibility of lateral supports 
for a tunnel crossing difficult geologic conditions (Anderson and Williams 2004), and the 
necessity for stiff supports in soft to medium stiff clays (Finno et al 2002). However, the 
construction techniques for most of the secant pile walls mentioned above remain similar. 
The typical construction technique involves 7 steps per unit, which consists of two primary 
bored piles and one secondary bored pile (Land Transport Authority 2007). The first step is to 
construct a guide wall so as to position the secant pile wall. The next step is the installation of 
casing for the first primary bored pile. This requires the casing being to be driven into the ground, 
leaving about one meter of the casing protruding above the ground. In the third step, the soil 
within the casing is removed to form a borehole. It is possible that the casing will not be long 
enough for the designed or required depth in the ground. Bentonite slurry is usually utilized as the 
support material below the casing. Concrete is subsequently poured into the borehole to produce 
the primary bored pile, Step 4. The second primary bored pile can be fabricated by repeating 
Steps 2 to 4. Steps 5 to 7 involve the construction of the secondary bored pile. The casings of the 
two primary bored piles need to be pulled out after a minimum 24-hour curing time is reached. A 
secondary borehole is formed by using an auger to cut and remove the soil in between the two 
primary bored piles. The last 2 steps used to form the secondary bored pile are to place a steel 
cage into the secondary borehole, and then pour concrete into the borehole. Steps 2 through 7 are 
repeated until the secant pile wall is completed. Figure 1 is a sketch diagram illustrating how a 
unit of the secant pile wall is constructed.

Again, the entire training procedure must be iterated until a pre-specified number of iterations or 
the termination criteria are reached. 
 
Lattice Initialization Method 
Based on the efficient initialization scheme from a previous study (Su et al 1999), we let the 
smallest hyper-rectangle of the parameter space be denoted as [ ] [ ]nn hlhl ,, 11 ××L , where il is the 
lowest valid value of the ith parameter and ih is the highest one. Supposing that the neurons on the 
four corners have their corresponding weight vectors as follows: 
T
nlllw ),,,( 211,1 K=  ,            (6) 
T
nNM hhhw ),,,( 21, K=  ,            (7)

⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦ TnnnM llhhhw ),,,,,,( 122211, KK +=  .         (9) 
We can find the initialization for the weight vectors on the 4 edges, as shown by

where the initialize process is on the basis of “from top to bottom and from left to right”. We can 
keep the weight vectors from being linearly dependent by randomly adding a noise vector r . 
Accordingly, we define Tnrrr ),,( 1 L=  which is a uniformly distributed number between

Projected Fitness Landscape 
The fitness landscape is used to provide a possible better solution by searching for a peak in a 
specific region. This broadly searching, so-called projected fitness landscape, can be applied to 
one or multi-dimensional cases, which is an important feature of the SOMO. To visualize the 
selection of a specific region, given a small group of neurons in the space of NM × , we first 
narrow down a searching space for the winning neuron and its neighbors ff NM × . Using the 
hyper-rectangle of ],[],[ 11 fnfnff hlhl ××L , the proposed lattice initialization method is repeated 
to re-initialize the NM × neuron lattice. Thus, the local optimization can be obtained and reserved 
for comparison with others derived from repetition of the training procedure and the lattice 
 7
There are only two limitations for this computation which tries to simulate reality. One is the 
number of sets of equipment used. The maximum capacity allowed for simultaneous construction 
work at the site is 4 sets of equipment, but 3 sets were utilized throughout. The other is the 
assumption of sequence. There is only one condition for a construction sequence for bored piles: 
a secondary bored pile can not be built until setting is complete in its two neighboring primary 
bored piles. In addition, the pre-specified iteration number is set to 100 with a randomly assigned 
hyper-rectangle of the parameter space where there are 104 neurons in the space.  
Following the 3 modifications described in the previous sections we can compute the optimal 
construction time using the SOMO algorithm. As a total of 207 bored piles, the input data are 
considered as a 207 by 16 matrix. According to the lattice initialization method, the smallest 
hyper-plane is a 16 dimension hyper-plane with the corresponding upper and lower bounds of 
each dimension. For example, the upper and lower bounds of the first dimension in the smallest 
hyper-plane are defined, respectively, based on the maximum and minimum values of the first 
activity, or say, grading. Given a small group of neurons in the space of NM × , we narrow down 
the searching space for the winning neuron and its neighbors ff NM × . Repeating the training 
procedure to maximize the objective function shown in Equation (3) and adjusting the weights 
using Equation (4) and (5), SOMO yields the optimization result shown in Table 1 and Table 2. 
Table 1 presents the corresponding weights and the global winner neuron at (9, 9). Table 2 also 
demonstrates the construction time and the sequences for both primary and secondary bored piles.

and secondary bored piles are based on the sorting of the weights of the corresponding 104 
neurons. For example, the No. 50 primary bored pile has the smallest weight, indicating that it is 
the first primary bored pile to be constructed among all 104 bored piles. Such sorting can easily 
yield the results shown in Table 2 that is the best sequence for the construction of a secant pile 
wall. Effectively and efficiently solving a time optimization problem by the SOMO algorithm is 
indeed useful. 
The results reveal that using the new SOMO algorithm has potential for improvements in the 
civil engineering and construction areas. There are many issues related to optimization, to which 
the SOMO algorithm can be applied, with only a few assumptions or restrictions, such as costs, 
route, and resource allocation. However, in the application discussed here, the following 
assumptions are made. The first one is related construction time. Only 16 activities plus concrete 
coagulation are considered in the time computation. Other activities, such as equipment 
movement, redeploying, and interaction with other facilities, could easily lead to extra time when 
the number of the equipment sets exceeds one. Although such activities do not appear in the 
collected data, they may affect the construction time of those 16 activities and the degree of their 
impact remains unknown. Another important assumption made in this case study is the given time 
for the setting of the concrete. In fact, this can vary depending on many conditions such as 
humidity, temperature, and water-cement ratio. It is difficult to know the coagulation time in 
advance which may lead to inaccuracy in predicting the optimal sequence. In addition, during the 
SOMO computation, it is found that the concrete coagulation time may be one of critical factors 
that determine the optimal sequences of both primary and second bored piles. Thirdly, soil 
conditions are not considered. The composition of the soil under the construction site may affect 
the construction time. For example, in the original sequence, the construction time of No. 72 
primary bored pile is about a half hour longer than No. 71’s and No. 73’s. In the optimal sequence 
yielded by the SOMO algorithm, No. 71 and 73 primary bored piles are completed ahead of 
No.72. This may change the soil condition and may reduce or increase the construction time of 
No. 72 primary bored pile. The last factor is associated with the skill level and physical condition 
of the equipment operators. Operators with different levels of operating skills or different levels 
of physical condition contribute to differentiation of the construction time. Such human effects 
are not included in the scope of this research. To achieve a better outcome closer to the reality, the 
impact of the afore-mentioned factors, although difficult to measure, should be considered. 
 
Conclusion 
In this study we examine a novel algorithm, SOMO, which can be used to solve optimization 
problems related to the construction time needed for a secant pile wall. The construction 
technique and sequence of the construction of the secant piles are first described, followed by the 
introduction of the original SOM concepts. The learning procedures carry out to obtain the
