model’s parameters were treated to be temperature dependent. 
 
Experimental Section 
The densities were determined with a pycnometer and the kinematic viscosities ν were 
measured using Cannon-Fenske routine viscometers. The kinematic viscosities ν were obtained 
from the relation, ktν = , where k is the capillary constant of viscometer and t is the flow time. The 
values of absolute viscosities η were calculated by using the equation of η = ρν.  
Results and Discussion 
Experimental results for the three binary systems of 1-butanol with MAA, BzMA, and 2-HEMA are 
listed in Tables 1 to 3, respectively. The excess volumes and viscosity deviations were correlated by 
a Redlich-Kister type polynomial1:

The coefficients of Ak and Bk were obtained by fitting the equations to the experimental values with 
a least-squares method. The correlated results for excess volumes and viscosity deviations are given 
respectively in Tables 4 and 5, in which the tabulated standard deviation σ was defined as:

where Y refers to VE or δη, n is the number of data points, and p is the number of coefficients. The 
subscript, exp. and cal., denote the experimental value and the calculated value, respectively. 
 
The variations of VE and δη with the mole fraction of 1-butanol for these three investigated 
systems at 308.15 K are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.  Figure 1 shows that the excess 
molar volumes are asymmetric and positive in 1-butanol + BzMA system, asymmetric and negative 
in 1-butanol + MAA system, and negative but nearly zero in 1-butanol + 2-HEMA system, over the 
These parameters in Eqs. 1, 2, 4, and 5 were also treated to be temperature dependent, as 
given by the following equations, respectively.

The best-fit values of the parameters together with the standard deviations σ of the calculated 
excess volumes and viscosity deviations and the average absolute deviations of the calculated 
kinematic viscosities for 1-butanol + MAA, 1-butanol + BzMA, and 1-butanol + 2-HEMA are 
given in Table 7.  As seen from Tables 4, 5, and 7, the standard deviations of the calculated excess 
volumes and viscosity deviations are approximately within the experimental uncertainty, regardless 
of the parameters treating as temperature-specific or temperature-dependent in the Redlich-Kister 
type polynomial. However, from Tables 6 and 7, the McAllister’s multi-body interaction model 
with temperature-specific parameters yielded better calculated results than with 
temperature-dependent parameters did for those three investigated systems.
