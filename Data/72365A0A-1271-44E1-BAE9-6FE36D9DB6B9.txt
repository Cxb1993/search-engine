Abstract 
RNA plays a crucial role in 
post-transcriptional regulation. Unlike DNA 
binding proteins, which recognize motifs 
composed of conserved sequences, RNA 
protein binding sites are more conserved in 
structures than in sequences. Though some 
current approaches can now identify common 
structure motifs from a set of RNAs, they 
typically assume the given set forms a single 
family, which is not necessarily correct. We 
proposed and developed a new adaptive 
method that conducts structure prediction as 
well as clustering simultaneously. We 
demonstrated its performance on several real 
RNA families. 
 
Keywords: RNA, secondary structures, 
clustering 
 
Introduction 
Like proteins, RNA functions generally 
depend on their structures. Although structural 
genomics, the systematic study of all 
macro-molecular structures in a genome, is 
currently focused more on proteins, thousands 
of genes produce transcripts exerting their 
functions without ever producing protein 
products [1]. It can be easily argued that the 
comprehensive understanding of the biology 
of a cell requires the knowledge of identity of 
all functional RNAs (both non-coding and 
protein-coding) and their molecular structures. 
Since it is often difficult to acquire the 3D 
spectrum data of RNA molecules for structure 
determination, versatile and reliable 
computational methods that can predict RNA 
structures are highly desirable. 
Many computational methods for the 
prediction of RNA secondary structures have 
been developed. According to the search 
strategies used, they can be roughly classified 
into the following categories: (1) 
thermodynamics, (2) comparative sequence 
analysis, (3) stochastic context-free grammars, 
(4) heuristics and (5) hybrid. By applying 
dynamic programming, thermodynamic 
methods are aimed to find the optimal 
secondary structure for single RNA sequences 
with the global minimum free energy [2-4]. If 
homologous sequences are available, from the 
alignment of these sequences, comparative 
approaches look for covariance evidence 
between base pairs to identify consensus 
structures [5-8]. Some researchers applied 
stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG) to 
build a probabilistic model for consensus 
structures in a family of related RNAs, which 
is considered the SCFG-based analogue of 
profile HMMs [9,10]. The tree structure of 
this SCFG-based analogue allows for a 
convenient graphical representation that 
intuitively and compactly reflects the structure 
of the RNA family being modeled [11]. Due to 
the fact that the time and space complexity of 
most methods are still too high to be practical, 
some approaches adapt useful heuristics to 
alleviate the problem [12-15]. Although these 
methods are not guaranteed to fine the optimal 
structure, they are able to produce the 
approximately best solutions. There also exist 
some hybrid approaches that combine the 
virtue of various strategies such as 
thermodynamic stability, sequence covariance, 
phylogenetic analysis, etc. [16-18]. Besides 
the search strategy that describes how to find 
the solutions, RNA secondary structure 
the evolutionary process in genetic 
programming. Nevertheless, when the input 
dataset contains multiple functional classes, 
the recall measure may dominate the 
calculation of F-score if the fitness function 
treats the entire dataset as a single class. This 
will mislead the system to find over-general 
elements shared by most sequences. To 
alleviate the bias, we defined a new measure 
of recall. By taking cluster size into account, 
we can better constrain the search space and 
allow conserved clusters to emerge more 
likely instead of being buried in bigger but 
much less coherent clusters.  
The GP (Genetic Programming)-based 
structure prediction method can find the fittest 
secondary structure elements according to a 
given range of the cluster size, while the 
significance of the cluster found along with its 
characteristic structure elements is highly 
dependent on the range we choose. With 
proper adjustment of cluster size through the 
generate-and-test procedure combined with 
the GP-based prediction method, we can 
identify a meaningful cluster and the 
associated characteristic structure elements.  
The adaptive adjustment of cluster size in 
the generate-and-test procedure is controlled 
by the consensus structure specificity. It is 
defined as the Laplace prior precision. The 
Laplace prior approach has also been applied 
to inductive leaning to evaluate the 
significance of inductive rules [24]. We 
incorporate the Laplace prior into the 
calculation of precision with the aim to avoid 
well conserved but too small clusters. Note 
that the Laplace prior precision is only used to 
determine the significance of a cluster found, 
unlike the F-score, which is used to direct the 
optimization process to find the best structure 
elements under the constraints of the cluster 
size. By the comparison of the Laplace prior 
precision with a pre-specified threshold, we 
can adjust the range of cluster size accordingly, 
and then re-run the GP-based method to 
predict a new structure element and derive the 
new cluster it characterizes. 
Once a significant cluster is found, we 
separate all its members out of the given 
dataset of RNA sequences. We then apply the 
same procedure to those that still remain in the 
dataset until the entire set is emptied. This 
separate-and-conquer strategy is effective 
even when no prior knowledge of the 
identities of the clusters is given. It can 
automatically partition the given dataset into 
meaningful clusters, and also identify their 
characteristic structure elements. 
 
Experimental Results 
Two types of quality were considered to 
evaluate the performance of our method. One 
is to measure the agreement between the 
predicted clusters and the actual cluster 
identities; the other, to quantify the agreement 
between the predicted structure elements and 
the actual structure assignment. We applied 
the adjusted Rand index [28] and the 
Matthews correlation coefficient [29] to 
measure the qualities. 
Our algorithm is designed to automatically 
partition a given set of unaligned RNA 
sequences into meaningful clusters, each 
associated with characteristic conserved 
secondary structure elements. The number of 
real clusters and the distribution of cluster size 
may affect the prediction of partitions and 
characteristic structure elements. To measure 
their effect on the performance, we tested our 
method on different datasets with various 
number and size of clusters. We used three 
families, including 16S RNA, IRE (Iron 
Response Element) and viral 3’UTR, to 
prepare the test datasets. They have been used 
in previous experiments and published in 
literature [15,19]. The sequence data and the 
correct structure elements can be accessed at 
public databases [26,27]. The 16S RNA 
dataset contains 34 archaea 16S ribosomal 
sequences originally derived from a set of 311 
sequences extracted from the SSU rRNA 
database. The archaea set of 311 sequences 
was further reduced to 34, filtering out the 
sequences that miss base assignments or are 
greater than 90% identical. The IRE dataset 
was constructed by Gorodkin et al. [19] from 
14 sequences from the UTR database. They 
modified the IREs and their UTRs to make the 
search more difficult. By iteratively shuffling 
the sequences and randomly adding one 
nucleotide to the IRE conserved region, they 
built a set of 56 IRE-like sequences from the 
14 IRE UTRs. The third data set includes 18 
viral 3'UTRs each of which contains a 
pseudoknot. Seven of the RNA sequences are 
the soil-borne rye mosaic viruses; the others 
are the soil-borne wheat mosaic viruses. 
With the three real families of RNA 
sequences, we first tested our method on each 
possible pair of the families, i.e. 16S 
RNA/IRE, 16S RNA/viral 3’UTR, and 
IRE/viral 3’UTR. We then applied our method

Like zinc, magnesium is also a versatile and important metal cofactor. It helps stabilize a 
variety of protein structures, e.g., the interface of the ribonucleotide reductase subunits [12]. It is 
also used to stabilize nucleic acids by alleviating electrostatic repulsion between negatively 
charged phosphates [13]. A few relatively short sequence motifs have been discovered for Mg2+ 
proteins with close sequence homology. Examples include the NADFDGD motif, found in 
different RNA polymerases, DNA Pol I and HIV reverse transcriptase, and the YXDD or LXDD 
motifs in reverse transcriptase and telomerase, where the residues in bold are the Mg2+ ligands 
[2]. Nevertheless, these Mg2+ sequence motifs are sometimes too short to be statistically specific 
to Mg2+-binding sites, and may easily escape detection. On the other hand, the Mg2+-binding 
sites share sufficient structural similarity that can characterize Mg2+-proteins. 
As the conserved local structural features can be identified in various ways and described in 
different representations, e.g., the relationships between local sequences and structures [14-16], 
we took a simpler approach and applied the widely used 1D motif detection algorithms to protein 
structural alphabet sequences. Representing conserved local structural features by 1D structural 
alphabets instead of 3D co-ordinates is more efficient in comparison and more economical in 
storage. The 1D-based approaches can also serve as a pre-processor to filter out remotely related 
or irrelevant proteins before we apply other more accurate but more computationally intensive 
structure analysis tool. To demonstrate its applicability, we applied the 1D-based approach to 
discovering structural motifs in Zn-binding and Mg-binding proteins, and compared the motifs 
found against those reported in literature. 
  
2. Materials and Methods 
 
We first transformed protein sequences into a 1D representation, and later identified 
significant motifs from the 1D alphabet sequences that could characterize the local structural 
features. There are several protein structural alphabets available [17-19]. As these alphabets were 
derived from different design philosophies, their sizes can vary from a dozen to nearly a hundred. 
They address different structural characteristics and have various applications. Therefore, in 
different domains, we can apply an appropriate structural alphabet to transform amino acid 
sequences or protein 3D structures into 1D structural alphabet sequences as required. Currently, 
we use the alphabet designed for SA-FAST [20]. It contains 18 letters, five of which represent 
the helix structure, eight for the sheet, and the rest for the coil. 
Given a set of functionally or structurally related proteins, after the conversion into 1D 
structural alphabet sequences, we can apply a sequence motif detection algorithm to discover 
significant motifs. There has been significant amount of research on motif discovery with 
different objective functions, motif representations and search strategies [21-23]. In our study, we 
used MEME [24] to detect structural motifs, which adopts an expectation maximization 
approach to find motifs represented as weight matrices. Unlike IUPAC-IUB codes, motifs 
described in weight matrices are more flexible because a weight matrix can show each alphabet 
letter preference in every motif position. Besides, a weight matrix can be easily transformed to 
IUPAC-IUB codes or regular expressions when necessary, but not vice versa.  
We call the motifs found by MEME in the structural alphabet sequences simple motifs. When 
the local properties in protein structures are too complicated, e.g. multiple binding sites or 
sub-domains, to capture in a simple motif, we combine several simple motifs into a compound 
motif. To avoid the computational complexity of combining matrices, we transform simple 
transcription factor IIIA, and has since been found in many transcription factors and in other 
DNA-binding proteins.  
This classic C2H2 zinc finger typically contains a repeated ~30 amino sequences. To 
demonstrate that our approach is capable of detecting the structural ββα-unit, we first 
transformed the 156 zinc finger proteins in SCOP C2H2 zinc finger family into structural 
alphabet sequences, and then applied standard motif-finding algorithms to these sequences to 
identify common motifs that can characterize the ββα-unit.  
We used 8 as the motif width and ran MEME to find motifs. A motif found was considered as 
corresponding to a sub-domain correctly if more than half of the residues in the sub-domain were 
included in the motif. If any simple motif or compound motif correctly corresponded to a 
sub-domain, we claimed this sub-domain was recovered successfully (i.e. a hit). In Table 1, we 
present the simple motif or compound motif found to characterize the sub-domains, and its 
coverage. The results suggest that using standard motif-finding algorithms, e.g. MEME, 
combined with an appropriate structural alphabet was able to recover the structural sub-domains 
in C2H2 zinc finger proteins. We show some C2H2 zinc finger proteins with structural motifs 
highlighted in color in Figure 2. 
Unlike Zn2+ binding sites, Mg2+ binding sites have less sequence similarity, but sufficient 
structural similarity, which make an appropriate test case to verify our motif-finding method’s 
capability of discovering structural motifs with low sequence homology. Previously, Dudev and 
Lim applied a similar idea to identify the structural motifs in Mg2+-binding proteins [13]. In the 
study, they successfully discovered four motifs corresponding to the Mg2+ binding sites in 16 out 
of 70 Mg2+-binding proteins. For comparison, we used the same 70 proteins in our experiments. 
Instead of the structural alphabet in PBE [27], we used the alphabet designed for SA-FAST [20] 
to represent the 70 Mg2+-binding proteins. Furthermore, we used a widely-used motif-finding 
system, MEME, rather than a method solely based on motif occurrence frequency [28], to 
identify common motifs (simple motifs) first, and then combined those significant simple motifs 
(i.e. with low E-value) into compound motifs.  
We show in Table 2 some of the compound motifs that cover the Mg2+-binding residues. Each 
of the simple motifs has an E-value lower than 1.9e-015 as presented in Table 3. Based on the 
compound motifs generated, we noticed that Mg2+-specific structural compound motifs are not 
commonly shared among the 70 Mg2+-binding proteins. This observation is similar to that by 
Dudev and Lim [13], who found only four first-shell structural motifs shared by more than three 
Mg2+-binding proteins, with a total of 16 proteins containing these motifs. Unlike Dudev and 
Lim, who defined a structural motif based on its occurrence frequency, we constructed 
compound motifs, more flexible and expressive than Dudev and Lim’s, from significant simple 
motifs found by MEME. By constraining the number of simple motifs, e.g. setting a reasonable 
E-value threshold, we can reduce the search space for compound motif candidates, and still avoid 
the risk of overlooking less frequent but significant structural motifs.    
 
4. Conclusion 
 
 In this paper, we introduced a general framework for structural motif discovery, and applied 
it to two types of metalloproteins, Mg2+-binding proteins and C2H2 zinc finger proteins. Two 
major components in our framework are the structural alphabet used to describe protein 
structures and the motif-finding algorithm used to discover significant local structure features. In

Abstract 
RNA plays a crucial role in 
post-transcriptional regulation. Unlike DNA 
binding proteins, which recognize motifs 
composed of conserved sequences, RNA 
protein binding sites are more conserved in 
structures than in sequences. Though some 
current approaches can now identify common 
structure motifs from a set of RNAs, they 
typically assume the given set forms a single 
family, which is not necessarily correct. We 
proposed and developed a new adaptive 
method that conducts structure prediction as 
well as clustering simultaneously. We 
demonstrated its performance on several real 
RNA families. 
 
Keywords: RNA, secondary structures, 
clustering 
 
Introduction 
Like proteins, RNA functions generally 
depend on their structures. Although structural 
genomics, the systematic study of all 
macro-molecular structures in a genome, is 
currently focused more on proteins, thousands 
of genes produce transcripts exerting their 
functions without ever producing protein 
products [1]. It can be easily argued that the 
comprehensive understanding of the biology 
of a cell requires the knowledge of identity of 
all functional RNAs (both non-coding and 
protein-coding) and their molecular structures. 
Since it is often difficult to acquire the 3D 
spectrum data of RNA molecules for structure 
determination, versatile and reliable 
computational methods that can predict RNA 
structures are highly desirable. 
Many computational methods for the 
prediction of RNA secondary structures have 
been developed. According to the search 
strategies used, they can be roughly classified 
into the following categories: (1) 
thermodynamics, (2) comparative sequence 
analysis, (3) stochastic context-free grammars, 
(4) heuristics and (5) hybrid. By applying 
dynamic programming, thermodynamic 
methods are aimed to find the optimal 
secondary structure for single RNA sequences 
with the global minimum free energy [2-4]. If 
homologous sequences are available, from the 
alignment of these sequences, comparative 
approaches look for covariance evidence 
between base pairs to identify consensus 
structures [5-8]. Some researchers applied 
stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG) to 
build a probabilistic model for consensus 
structures in a family of related RNAs, which 
is considered the SCFG-based analogue of 
profile HMMs [9,10]. The tree structure of 
this SCFG-based analogue allows for a 
convenient graphical representation that 
intuitively and compactly reflects the structure 
of the RNA family being modeled [11]. Due to 
the fact that the time and space complexity of 
most methods are still too high to be practical, 
some approaches adapt useful heuristics to 
alleviate the problem [12-15]. Although these 
methods are not guaranteed to fine the optimal 
structure, they are able to produce the 
approximately best solutions. There also exist 
some hybrid approaches that combine the 
virtue of various strategies such as 
thermodynamic stability, sequence covariance, 
phylogenetic analysis, etc. [16-18]. Besides 
the search strategy that describes how to find 
the solutions, RNA secondary structure 
the evolutionary process in genetic 
programming. Nevertheless, when the input 
dataset contains multiple functional classes, 
the recall measure may dominate the 
calculation of F-score if the fitness function 
treats the entire dataset as a single class. This 
will mislead the system to find over-general 
elements shared by most sequences. To 
alleviate the bias, we defined a new measure 
of recall. By taking cluster size into account, 
we can better constrain the search space and 
allow conserved clusters to emerge more 
likely instead of being buried in bigger but 
much less coherent clusters.  
The GP (Genetic Programming)-based 
structure prediction method can find the fittest 
secondary structure elements according to a 
given range of the cluster size, while the 
significance of the cluster found along with its 
characteristic structure elements is highly 
dependent on the range we choose. With 
proper adjustment of cluster size through the 
generate-and-test procedure combined with 
the GP-based prediction method, we can 
identify a meaningful cluster and the 
associated characteristic structure elements.  
The adaptive adjustment of cluster size in 
the generate-and-test procedure is controlled 
by the consensus structure specificity. It is 
defined as the Laplace prior precision. The 
Laplace prior approach has also been applied 
to inductive leaning to evaluate the 
significance of inductive rules [24]. We 
incorporate the Laplace prior into the 
calculation of precision with the aim to avoid 
well conserved but too small clusters. Note 
that the Laplace prior precision is only used to 
determine the significance of a cluster found, 
unlike the F-score, which is used to direct the 
optimization process to find the best structure 
elements under the constraints of the cluster 
size. By the comparison of the Laplace prior 
precision with a pre-specified threshold, we 
can adjust the range of cluster size accordingly, 
and then re-run the GP-based method to 
predict a new structure element and derive the 
new cluster it characterizes. 
Once a significant cluster is found, we 
separate all its members out of the given 
dataset of RNA sequences. We then apply the 
same procedure to those that still remain in the 
dataset until the entire set is emptied. This 
separate-and-conquer strategy is effective 
even when no prior knowledge of the 
identities of the clusters is given. It can 
automatically partition the given dataset into 
meaningful clusters, and also identify their 
characteristic structure elements. 
 
Experimental Results 
Two types of quality were considered to 
evaluate the performance of our method. One 
is to measure the agreement between the 
predicted clusters and the actual cluster 
identities; the other, to quantify the agreement 
between the predicted structure elements and 
the actual structure assignment. We applied 
the adjusted Rand index [28] and the 
Matthews correlation coefficient [29] to 
measure the qualities. 
Our algorithm is designed to automatically 
partition a given set of unaligned RNA 
sequences into meaningful clusters, each 
associated with characteristic conserved 
secondary structure elements. The number of 
real clusters and the distribution of cluster size 
may affect the prediction of partitions and 
characteristic structure elements. To measure 
their effect on the performance, we tested our 
method on different datasets with various 
number and size of clusters. We used three 
families, including 16S RNA, IRE (Iron 
Response Element) and viral 3’UTR, to 
prepare the test datasets. They have been used 
in previous experiments and published in 
literature [15,19]. The sequence data and the 
correct structure elements can be accessed at 
public databases [26,27]. The 16S RNA 
dataset contains 34 archaea 16S ribosomal 
sequences originally derived from a set of 311 
sequences extracted from the SSU rRNA 
database. The archaea set of 311 sequences 
was further reduced to 34, filtering out the 
sequences that miss base assignments or are 
greater than 90% identical. The IRE dataset 
was constructed by Gorodkin et al. [19] from 
14 sequences from the UTR database. They 
modified the IREs and their UTRs to make the 
search more difficult. By iteratively shuffling 
the sequences and randomly adding one 
nucleotide to the IRE conserved region, they 
built a set of 56 IRE-like sequences from the 
14 IRE UTRs. The third data set includes 18 
viral 3'UTRs each of which contains a 
pseudoknot. Seven of the RNA sequences are 
the soil-borne rye mosaic viruses; the others 
are the soil-borne wheat mosaic viruses. 
With the three real families of RNA 
sequences, we first tested our method on each 
possible pair of the families, i.e. 16S 
RNA/IRE, 16S RNA/viral 3’UTR, and 
IRE/viral 3’UTR. We then applied our method

Like zinc, magnesium is also a versatile and important metal cofactor. It helps stabilize a 
variety of protein structures, e.g., the interface of the ribonucleotide reductase subunits [12]. It is 
also used to stabilize nucleic acids by alleviating electrostatic repulsion between negatively 
charged phosphates [13]. A few relatively short sequence motifs have been discovered for Mg2+ 
proteins with close sequence homology. Examples include the NADFDGD motif, found in 
different RNA polymerases, DNA Pol I and HIV reverse transcriptase, and the YXDD or LXDD 
motifs in reverse transcriptase and telomerase, where the residues in bold are the Mg2+ ligands 
[2]. Nevertheless, these Mg2+ sequence motifs are sometimes too short to be statistically specific 
to Mg2+-binding sites, and may easily escape detection. On the other hand, the Mg2+-binding 
sites share sufficient structural similarity that can characterize Mg2+-proteins. 
As the conserved local structural features can be identified in various ways and described in 
different representations, e.g., the relationships between local sequences and structures [14-16], 
we took a simpler approach and applied the widely used 1D motif detection algorithms to protein 
structural alphabet sequences. Representing conserved local structural features by 1D structural 
alphabets instead of 3D co-ordinates is more efficient in comparison and more economical in 
storage. The 1D-based approaches can also serve as a pre-processor to filter out remotely related 
or irrelevant proteins before we apply other more accurate but more computationally intensive 
structure analysis tool. To demonstrate its applicability, we applied the 1D-based approach to 
discovering structural motifs in Zn-binding and Mg-binding proteins, and compared the motifs 
found against those reported in literature. 
  
2. Materials and Methods 
 
We first transformed protein sequences into a 1D representation, and later identified 
significant motifs from the 1D alphabet sequences that could characterize the local structural 
features. There are several protein structural alphabets available [17-19]. As these alphabets were 
derived from different design philosophies, their sizes can vary from a dozen to nearly a hundred. 
They address different structural characteristics and have various applications. Therefore, in 
different domains, we can apply an appropriate structural alphabet to transform amino acid 
sequences or protein 3D structures into 1D structural alphabet sequences as required. Currently, 
we use the alphabet designed for SA-FAST [20]. It contains 18 letters, five of which represent 
the helix structure, eight for the sheet, and the rest for the coil. 
Given a set of functionally or structurally related proteins, after the conversion into 1D 
structural alphabet sequences, we can apply a sequence motif detection algorithm to discover 
significant motifs. There has been significant amount of research on motif discovery with 
different objective functions, motif representations and search strategies [21-23]. In our study, we 
used MEME [24] to detect structural motifs, which adopts an expectation maximization 
approach to find motifs represented as weight matrices. Unlike IUPAC-IUB codes, motifs 
described in weight matrices are more flexible because a weight matrix can show each alphabet 
letter preference in every motif position. Besides, a weight matrix can be easily transformed to 
IUPAC-IUB codes or regular expressions when necessary, but not vice versa.  
We call the motifs found by MEME in the structural alphabet sequences simple motifs. When 
the local properties in protein structures are too complicated, e.g. multiple binding sites or 
sub-domains, to capture in a simple motif, we combine several simple motifs into a compound 
motif. To avoid the computational complexity of combining matrices, we transform simple 
transcription factor IIIA, and has since been found in many transcription factors and in other 
DNA-binding proteins.  
This classic C2H2 zinc finger typically contains a repeated ~30 amino sequences. To 
demonstrate that our approach is capable of detecting the structural ββα-unit, we first 
transformed the 156 zinc finger proteins in SCOP C2H2 zinc finger family into structural 
alphabet sequences, and then applied standard motif-finding algorithms to these sequences to 
identify common motifs that can characterize the ββα-unit.  
We used 8 as the motif width and ran MEME to find motifs. A motif found was considered as 
corresponding to a sub-domain correctly if more than half of the residues in the sub-domain were 
included in the motif. If any simple motif or compound motif correctly corresponded to a 
sub-domain, we claimed this sub-domain was recovered successfully (i.e. a hit). In Table 1, we 
present the simple motif or compound motif found to characterize the sub-domains, and its 
coverage. The results suggest that using standard motif-finding algorithms, e.g. MEME, 
combined with an appropriate structural alphabet was able to recover the structural sub-domains 
in C2H2 zinc finger proteins. We show some C2H2 zinc finger proteins with structural motifs 
highlighted in color in Figure 2. 
Unlike Zn2+ binding sites, Mg2+ binding sites have less sequence similarity, but sufficient 
structural similarity, which make an appropriate test case to verify our motif-finding method’s 
capability of discovering structural motifs with low sequence homology. Previously, Dudev and 
Lim applied a similar idea to identify the structural motifs in Mg2+-binding proteins [13]. In the 
study, they successfully discovered four motifs corresponding to the Mg2+ binding sites in 16 out 
of 70 Mg2+-binding proteins. For comparison, we used the same 70 proteins in our experiments. 
Instead of the structural alphabet in PBE [27], we used the alphabet designed for SA-FAST [20] 
to represent the 70 Mg2+-binding proteins. Furthermore, we used a widely-used motif-finding 
system, MEME, rather than a method solely based on motif occurrence frequency [28], to 
identify common motifs (simple motifs) first, and then combined those significant simple motifs 
(i.e. with low E-value) into compound motifs.  
We show in Table 2 some of the compound motifs that cover the Mg2+-binding residues. Each 
of the simple motifs has an E-value lower than 1.9e-015 as presented in Table 3. Based on the 
compound motifs generated, we noticed that Mg2+-specific structural compound motifs are not 
commonly shared among the 70 Mg2+-binding proteins. This observation is similar to that by 
Dudev and Lim [13], who found only four first-shell structural motifs shared by more than three 
Mg2+-binding proteins, with a total of 16 proteins containing these motifs. Unlike Dudev and 
Lim, who defined a structural motif based on its occurrence frequency, we constructed 
compound motifs, more flexible and expressive than Dudev and Lim’s, from significant simple 
motifs found by MEME. By constraining the number of simple motifs, e.g. setting a reasonable 
E-value threshold, we can reduce the search space for compound motif candidates, and still avoid 
the risk of overlooking less frequent but significant structural motifs.    
 
4. Conclusion 
 
 In this paper, we introduced a general framework for structural motif discovery, and applied 
it to two types of metalloproteins, Mg2+-binding proteins and C2H2 zinc finger proteins. Two 
major components in our framework are the structural alphabet used to describe protein 
structures and the motif-finding algorithm used to discover significant local structure features. In
