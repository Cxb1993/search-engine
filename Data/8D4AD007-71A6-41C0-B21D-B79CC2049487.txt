一、報告內容 
In the study of molecular evolution, 
traditional tree-building approaches are 
usually based on only the sequence 
similarity of a single gene or some selected 
ones (we hereinafter refer this kind of tree 
analysis to as “gene-tree” building). 
However, the phylogenies derived from 
such gene-tree buildings are rarely 
consistent with each other, due to unequal 
rates of nucleotide substitution, horizontal 
gene transfer and unrecognized duplication 
genes (i.e., paralogy). Now, with the 
multiple and complete genome sequences at 
hand, it appears natural to seek for 
alternatives to gene-tree buildings in terms 
of the complete set of genes contained in 
species genomes (that is, genome-tree 
buildings). One of the promising ways is to 
compare the difference of gene orders, 
which had been pioneered by Dobzhansky 
and Sturtevant (1938) in their classical 
work of the reconstruction of Drosophila 
chromosomes based on reversals (or called 
inversions) [DS38]. 
During species evolution, the gene 
orders on chromosomal genomes are subject 
to genome rearrangements by altering the 
ordering and orientation (i.e., strandedness) 
of genes on the chromosomes. Generally, 
gene order is well conserved at closely 
related species, mostly because the 
rearrangement events have not yet had time 
to occur. On the other hand, for distantly 
related species, the degree of gene order 
conservation is usually low. Compared to 
point mutations (such as substitution, 
insertion and deletion of a single 
nucleotide/amino acid in a genomic 
sequence), the rearrangement events that 
change genomes in large scale are rare and 
hence they can give us valuable information 
about the inference of the evolutionary 
history of organisms. 
The genomes in the studies of 
genome rearrangements are usually 
denoted by a permutation of ordered 
(signed or unsigned) integers with each 
integer representing a gene and its sign (+ 
or -) indicating the transcriptional 
orientation. To evaluate the evolutionary 
distance between two related genomes in 
gene order, various rearrangement events 
(or operations) acting on genes within or 
among chromosomes have been proposed, 
such as reversal (also known as inversion 
in biology) of a chromosomal segment (of 
some consecutive genes) [BP96, BYM01, 
KST00], transposition of a segment from 
one position on a chromosome to another 
[BP98, EH05], block-interchange of two 
segments on a chromosome [Chr96, 
LLCT05, LWLT05, LHWC06, LLLT06], 
translocation of terminal segments 
between two chromosomes [Han96, KR95], 
fusion of two chromosomes (into a larger 
chromosome) [MD01, LHWC06] and 
fission of a chromosome (into two smaller 
chromosomes) [MD01, LHWC06]. Given 
two permutations of genomes, the objective 
of the genome rearrangement problem is 
to find a shortest sequence of 
rearrangement operations required to 
transform one genome into another. If one 
of the two permutations is the identity 
permutation, then the above problem can

ROBIN and SPRING can only be applied to 
uni-chromosomal genomes. Moreover, if the 
input is a set of genomes, the SoRT2 extracts 
the genes annotated in the genomes and 
identify the orthologous genes between any 
pair of species genomes. Finally, we have 
conducted several experiments using many 
Proteobacteria complete genomes to assess 
the quality of the SoRT2 web server. 
Compared with those genome trees obtained 
by the ROBIN and SPRING, the genome 
trees created by the SoRT2 are greatly 
consistent with those reference trees that 
were constructed based on 16S rRNAs.
