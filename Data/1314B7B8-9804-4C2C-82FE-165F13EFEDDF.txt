continuous-coordinate system to consider the effect of mass distribution in the beam elements, 
which can be achieved by using the dynamic stiffness method. From the differential equation 
of beam vibration, the relationships between harmonic forces and displacements at the ends 
of a beam element can be exactly established. These relations are usually referred to as the 
dynamic stiffness matrix. After the dynamic stiffness matrices of beam elements are derived, 
the dynamic stiffness matrix of the whole frame can be assembled by exactly the same 
procedure used in the static matrix structural analysis. The historical development of using 
the dynamic stiffness method in structural dynamics has been highlighted by Akesson [2]. 
There are two types of beam vibration theories. One is Bernoulli-Euler beam theory and 
the other is Timoshenko beam theory. Timoshenko beam theory considers the effects of shear 
deformation and rotational inertia, so that it is more accurate in the high-frequency response. 
Cheng [3] applied the dynamic stiffness method to analyze Timoshenko plane frames, but did 
not include the axial deformation effect in the dynamic stiffness matrix, which makes the 
analysis for the frames having side sway become not robotic. Wang and Lin [4] presented the 
transfer matrix method to analyze multi-span Timoshenko frames, but required all spans 
having the same span length and the same column height. 
The elements in the dynamic stiffness matrix are nonlinear functions, trigonometric and 
hyperbolic, of vibration frequency. The dynamic stiffness matrix can be directly employed in 
solving the steady-state response of the frames subjected to harmonic loadings. To solve the 
problems of transient response, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the frames must 
be first calculated from the dynamic stiffness matrix. The calculation is usually referred to as 
a nonlinear eigenproblem and is different from the linear eigenproblem encountered in the 
dynamic analysis of discrete systems. Extending the Sturm sequence property of linear 
eigenproblems, the Wittrick-Williams algorithm [5,6] can count the number of vibration 
modes exceeded by a specified frequency from the dynamic stiffness matrix. This ensures 
that no natural frequencies are missed when using the bisection or other methods [7] to solve 
the zero determinant equation of the dynamic stiffness matrix. There are several methods to 
solve the mode shapes from the dynamic stiffness matrix [8,9]. A deflated matrix approach to 
solve the mode shapes from the dynamic stiffness matrix is proposed by Tsai [10]. 
The orthogonality of vibration modes is the required condition of using the vibration 
modes to solve the transient response of the frames. The publications on the orthogonality of 
vibration modes employed in the dynamic stiffness matrix are few and less rigorous [11]. 
Tsai [10] derives the mode orthogonality condition of the Bernoulli-Euler plane frames with 
distributed mass. 
 In the present paper, the vibration theory of Timoshenko beams is applied to derive the 
dynamic stiffness matrices of beam elements. Orthogonal properties between vibration modes 
of different natural frequencies in Timoshenko plane frames considering distributed mass are 
theoretically derived, through which the equations of motion in beam elements can be

4. Dynamic stiffness of plane frames 
 
The plane frame shown in Fig. 2 is defined by a global coordinate system ),( yx . Let iu , 
iv  and iθ  denote the displacements in the x  and y  directions and the counter-clockwise 
rotation at node i, respectively. The total number of the unconstrained degrees of freedom in 
the joints of the frame is denoted as . The element J has two ends at nodes i and j. Let dn iX , 
iY  and iM  denote the forces in the x  and y  directions and the moment acting at the 
node i of element J, respectively. The transformation between the element local coordinates 
and the frame global coordinates gives

If the mode shapes that span the space of the repeated-root mode are orthogonal to each other, 
the magnitudes of  become negligible for nkm kn ≠ . 
 
8. Solution of natural frequencies and mode shape vectors 
 
The dynamic stiffness matrix of beam elements has a characteristic of being infinite at 
particular frequencies. The flexural dynamic stiffness in Eq. (20) becomes infinite when the 
function )(0 ωB  defined in Eq. (16) for 1<brs  or Eq. (26) for  becomes zero. The 
frequency satisfying 
1>brs
0)(0 =ωB  is the natural frequency of the corresponding beam element 
with clamped-clamped ends, i.e., 0)()0()()0( ==== LL φφψψ , which is called the flexural 
pole. The axial dynamic stiffness in Eq. (34) becomes infinite when the frequency fulfills 
, which is the natural frequencies of axial vibration in the corresponding beam 
element without axial displacement at ends, i.e., 
0)sin( =rb
0)()0( == Lχχ , and is called the axial 
pole. 
The difficulty in finding the natural frequencies of frames from Eq. (39) arises from the 
existence of element poles. This can be overcome by using the Wittrick-Williams algorithm 
[5,6]. The algorithm states that )(ωfn , the total number of natural frequencies in a frame 
below a specific frequency ω , is given by 
)}({)()( ωωω Ksnn pf +=  (73) 
where )(ωpn  is the total number of axial and flexural poles in all elements of the frame 
below the frequency ω ; )}({ ωKs , the sign count of )(ωK , is the number of negative 
pivots in the diagonal matrix of pivots  after D )(ωK  is factorized as 
TLDLK =)(ω  (74) 
 14
where  has been defined in Eq. (26). In Eq. (78), 0B bβα2  and b)( 22 μλ +  are 
independent of the length L of beam elements; bα  and bβ  are proportional to the length L, 
i.e., Lfb αα =  and Lfb ββ =  where  and  are the length-independent parameters. 
One possible solution of Eq. (78) is the frequencies satisfying 
αf βf
πα αα nLfb ≈=  ,   ππβ βαβ nmnLfb =+≈= )2(  (79) 
with  and  being integers. Added by an interior node, the beam element is divided 
into two sub-elements with the length 
αn βn
)2()1( LLL += . In the sub-element , one possible 
flexural pole is the frequencies satisfying 
)1(L
πα αα )1()1( nLfb ≈=  ,    (80) πβ ββ )1()1( nLfb ≈=
If the flexural poles in Eqs. (79) and (80) have the same frequency, it must be 
)1()1( LnLn αα ≈  ,   )1()1( LnLn ββ ≈  (81) 
In other words, adding an interior node to the beam element may not normalize the null mode 
if the length  of the sub-element meets the condition in Eq. (81). )1(L
To demonstrate this theory, Fig. 3 plots the function  in Eq. (78) varied with  
which is proportional to the frequency 
bB0 brs
ω  and is independent of the beam length L. The 
properties of the corresponding beams are , , 2m1=A 42 m10−=I 24 mN10=E , 
23 mN104×=G , 667.0=k  and mkg1=Aρ . Fig. 3(a) shows that the curves for 
 and  have two common poles near m5=L m5.2=L 13.1=brs  and another two common 
poles near . The data of these four common poles are listed in Table 1 which 
shows that the values of 
27.1=brs
πα /b  and πβ /b  can be approximated by integers  and , 
respectively, and the integers  and  fulfills the relation in Eq. (81) between 
αn βn
αn βn m5=L  
and , which means adding an interior node to the middle of a Timoshenko beam 
element (
m5.2)1( =L
5.0)1( =LL ) cannot eliminate the null modes at the frequencies listed in Table 1. 
The mode shapes corresponding to the poles listed in Table 1 for the fixed-end beam of 
length 5m are plotted in Figs. 4-7. In these mode shapes, the transverse displacements and 
sectional rotations at the centers of the beams, listed in Table 2, are very close to zero, which 
means that adding a middle node to beam element may have high residual. The residuals 
listed in Table 2 show that modes 32 and 38 have higher residual than modes 33 and 37. This 
is because the values of πα /b in modes 32 and 38 are closer to the corresponding integer 
 than those in modes 33 and 37. αn

can be more easily solved by using the equilibrium of nodal forces to find the axial force in 
beam elements, the same approach used in the Bernoulli-Euler plane frames [10]. 
 
10. Numerical examples 
 
10.1. Example 1 
 
Adapted from reference [10], the cross frame shown in Fig. 8 consists of four prismatic 
beams. Every beam has the same length of m4=L  and the same properties of , 
, , , 
22 m10−=A
44 m10−=I 29 N/m10=E 29 N/m104.0 ×=G 5.0=k  and . The 
transverse displacements and sectional rotations of the first four modes are plotted in Figs. 
9-12. Modes 2 and 3 are the double-roots modes which have the same natural frequency and 
orthogonal mode shapes. In these two modes, the center joint of the cross frame does not 
rotate but has small vertical and horizontal, respectively, translations. Table 4 shows that the 
first four natural frequencies of the Timoshenko frame are less than those of the 
Bernoulli-Euler frame. To prevent the null modes of flexural poles, an interior node is added 
to the middle of each beam, so the sub-element length ratio is . However, modes 
162 and 163, which are double-roots modes with natural frequency being 398.388Hz, have 
high residuals, a magnitude of 887.5, because the sub-element  has a pole of 
frequency 398.180Hz which is very close to the natural frequency of modes 162 and 163. The 
floating interior node approach moves the interior nodes and changes the sub-element length 
ratio to become , which can reduce the residuals of modes 162 and 163 to 
become 0.5097.

A vertical harmonic force kNsin tω with frequency zH400=ω is applied to point a at 
the middle of the beam shown in Fig 8. The damping properties of the cross frame are 
and 410−=ζ 1=η . The vertical displacement of point b at the middle of the beam shown in 
Fig. 8 is calculated by using 336 modes below 800 Hz and plotted in Fig. 13(a) which shows 
a lot of difference from the response of the Bernoulli-Euler frame depicted in Fig. 13(b). In 
the Timoshenko frame, point b starts vibrating at 0.02 second, but the Bernoulli-Euler frame 
starts vibrating at 0.008 second. The speed of flexural wave in the Bernoulli-Euler beam is 
faster than that of the Timoshenko beam. 
 
10.2. Example 2 
 
Adapted from reference [4], the three-span frame shown in Fig. 14 consists of five 
prismatic beams. Every beam has the same length of m10=L  and the same properties of
