Abstract – The ultimate goal of this research is to 
find the dispersion property of a cylindrical 
microstrip line with a substrate consisting of 
composite and chiral materials. We have proposed 
using 2x2 reflection matrices to deal with the 
fields in layered chiral media and using finite 
difference approach to tackle fields in layered 
composite materials. Before computing the 
dispersion property of the whole structure, we 
have concentrated on the dispersion property of 
the background material (without the presence of 
the metallic strip) in the first year of the project. 
Wherever possible, we compared our computed 
results with data available in the literature. 
Otherwise, we cross-verified our results obtained 
using the finite-difference approach and the 
reflection-matrix approach. 
Keywords: Chiral media, composite material, 
dispersion property. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Chiral media are the substances where their 
molecular structures possess handedness (or 
chirality). Natural chiral media include quartz, 
amino acid, DNA, sugar water, and tartaric acid, 
to name a few. For applications in microwave 
frequencies, chiral media can be constructed by 
embedding in a host material a large number of 
handed substances, such as twisted strips, Mobius 
strips, and helical wires. Owing to advances in 
material sciences and fabrication technology, 
material parameters of man-made chiral media 
can be better controlled and characterized; hence, 
more new applications of chiral media may be 
expected to appear in the future [1], [2]. 
Composite materials can be realized by combining 
electrically resistive polymeric resins with long 
conductive fibers, such as graphite, boron, or 
aramid (also called Kevlar). Because of their 
superior properties in terms of mechanical 
strength, structure stiffness, corrosion resistibility, 
and weight-to-volume ratio, composite materials 
have been widely applied as a good replacement 
for metal in aircraft, automobile, construction, and 
electronic industries [3], [4]. 
The ultimate objective of this study is to 
determine the dispersion property of a cylindrical 
microstrip line with a substrate consisting of 
composite and chiral materials. Before 
investigating the whole structure, we ought to find 
the dispersion property of the background 
structure that is without the presence of the 
metallic strip. The fields in the composite 
materials were tackled using a finite-difference 
approach, whereas the fields in the chiral 
materials were dealt with by a finite-difference 
approach or using 2 x 2 reflection-matrix 
approach. 
 
II. SOLUTION PROCEDURE 
Figure 1 shows a general cylindrical shell 
( ca ≤≤ ρ ) consisting of both the fiber-reinforced 
composite material ( ba ≤≤ ρ , called region 2) 
and the chiral medium ( cb ≤≤ ρ , called region 3). 
Interior to the shell ( a<ρ , called region 1) may 
be a simple medium (including air, of course) or a 
PEC; exterior to the shell ( c>ρ , called region 4) 
is air. With Mf  layers in region 2 and Mc layers 
in region 3, the material layers are numbered, 
from the innermost to the outermost, by 1,2, …, 
Mf + Mc. The thickness and outer radius of layer 
 are denoted by  and A Ad Aρ , respectively. This

Non-trivial solutions exist only when

in smaller effective dielectric constants. 
Presented in Fig. 11 are the dispersion curves of 
the HEM11-like mode for a circular dielectric 
waveguide covered with a composite material in 
region 2 and a chiral material in region 3 for 
different values of rκ . Interpretation of these 
results remains to be pursued in the future.  
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this report, a reflection-matrix approach and 
a finite-difference approach have been developed 
for analyzing the dispersion properties of the 
cylindrical layered structure consisting of 
composite and chiral materials. This layered 
structure is the background of a cylindrical 
microstrip line, whose dispersion characteristics 
will be determined in the second year of the 
three-year project period in the future. Before 
dealing with the dispersion property of the whole 
cylindrical microstrip line, we still need more 
efforts on the interpretation of the dispersion 
characteristics of the background structure.
