ABSTRACT 
 
    The fundamental theory of evaluating the representative polynomial of a set of smooth three-dimension- 
al surface data set is developed. Suppose that the representative polynomial of a given smooth data set exists. 
It is proven that one can use interpolation method to construct it provided that the exact form of the 
polynomial should be given. Numerical test shows that, if the representative polynomial is known, the error 
is insignificantly small only if the given interpolated polynomial takes exactly the same form. According to 
this theorem, a searching procedure is proposed to find the representative polynomial and is verified by a 
designed case. The procedure assign a data point as an identification point but does use it to evaluate the 
interpolated polynomial, the different between the data and interpolated result is considered as the error of 
the examined polynomial. As a first application, the present representative polynomial is interpreted in the 
one-dimensional form and applied to enhance the accuracy of the numerical solution solving a linear 
ordinary differential equation down to the machine error level. 
 
Keywords：Three-dimensional smooth surface data, representative polynomial, interpolation, searching rule

1. Introduction 
Rapid developments of computer software and 
hardware have opened many new fields such as the 
numerical analysis, data analysis, data mining, and 
etc.. Meanwhile, people have punched incredibly 
huge amount data via the computer and related 
technologies For example, numerical solutions of 
the ordinary and partial differential equations and 
data sets collected by available computer controlled 
data acquisition systems are familiar cases.     
Generally speaking, how to analyze, realize and 
store these data sets are frequently difficult topics. 
Consider the numerical solution of a partial 
differential equation as an example, people always 
ask the following questions: “Does the mesh fine 
enough? Does the solution consist to the desired 
solution? What are the embedded mechanisms? And 
etc.” Unfortunately, it is frequently very difficult to

Theorem 1 
 
Most results of the corresponding ija  and ijb  
are different from each other. The exception cases 
are that all the resulting coefficients ija  and ijb  
are equal to each other, and those coefficients of 
distinct ji yyxx )()( 00  s of Eqs.(2) and (3) are 
all zero.

Now many elements of A~  and B~  matrices are 
the same because they use the same powers of

elements of A~  and B~  are different from each 
other because they use different powers of

results of the corresponding ija  and ijb  are 
different from each other. The exception cases may 
exist in the following situations. That all the

Since ijij ba   and some terms even have different 
powers of x  and y , except at the interpolation 
points ),,( kk yx  nk ,...,1,0 , Eqs.(6) and (7) 
clearly show that ),( yxz  is different from 
),( yxze . Consequently, one can choose a medium 
different of z  and ez  as   and the theorem is 
proven. ■ 
 
Based on this theorem, the following extension 
can be easily constructed. 
 
Corollary 1.1 
 
   Consider a point Dzyx lll ),,(  which is a 
point different form all the original interpolation 
points ),,( kk yx  nk ,...,1,0 . Let ),(~ ll yxz  and 
),(~ lle yxz  be evaluated by the interpolated 
polynomials of Eq.(2) and Eq.(3), respectively. If 
ijij ab  is not valid for all indices ),( ji , there 
exists constants   and 1 such that

                     (8) 
If the computing procedures are free of the 
round-off error,   of Eq.(8) takes the zero value. 
 
Proof: 
 
 Since Eq.(2) is exact, lll zyxz ),( + round-off 
error. The resulting interpolation polynomial 
obviously proves the first inequality of Eq.(8) 
where   is the upper bound of the round-off error. 
Because Eq.(3) is a poor approximation as shown in 
Theorem 1, it is clear that  yxzyxze ,),(   for all 
Dyx ),(  that are not the interpolation points. 
Therefore, ),(~ lle yxz  deviates from lz  and hence 
the corollary is proven. ■ 
 
For convenience, let us make the following 
definition.

where   is the prescribed error tolerance, stop 
the searching procedure such the this 
polynomial is the desired one; otherwise go to 
step 5 and repeated; 
10. After searching all the defined polynomials, 
choose the one with minimal pd . The 
corresponding polynomial is the representative 
polynomial of the data set. 
 
After obtaining the representative polynomial, 
one should check if the corresponding pd  is 
satisfactory small. If pd is not small enough, one 
may Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) to see if the polynomial 
involve the Runge oscillatory behavior. Note that 
the searching range may not include the exact 
polynomial. In order to exclude such an undesirable 
result, the identifying point and data set S should 
be careful chosen. How to define the rules of 
choosing ),,( ppp zyx  and S  needs extensive 
future studies.  
 
2.2 Accuracy Enhancement of Numerical 
Solution of Ordinary Differential 
Equation. 
 
Let a well posed differential equation problem 
be written as follows. 
fTDL }){(                             (14) 
The numerical approximation of Eq.(14) is then 
fTL  }){( 0                            (15), 
where 0T  is the stable numerical solution of 
Eq.(15). Suppose 0T can be accurately 
approximated by a high degree approximating 
polynomial 0P . It is clearly that 
00  PT                             (16), 
where 0  is the error corresponding to the original 
numerical solution 0T . Since all the derivatives of 
Eq.(14) can be precisely estimated in terms of 0P , 
the following equations are valid.

             (17), 
where 0s is the estimated truncation plus round-off 
errors of Eq.(15) and 1T is the numerical solution 
to approximate 0 . Next, one can find another 
high degree approximating polynomial 1P to 
accurately approximate 1T . Following the same 
procedure, up to the k step, it can be summarized 
into the following relations.

The above procedure should modify the initial 
and/or boundary condition at every iteration step 
that may be suitable for the boundary value 
problem.  
 
For the initial value problem, the version 
without modifying the initial condition is more 
convenient than the form of Eq.(18). Therefore, the 
above formulas are rewritten into the following 
relations.

in which one needs not to update the 
initial/boundary conditions.  
 
According to the criteria of Eq.(19), one can 
then check if ks  so as to stop the iteration, 
where  is the error tolerance which can be around 
the machine error. In this study, a stiff ordinary 
differential equation, which is solved by the fourth 
Runge-Kutta method, will be employed to show the 
accuracy enhancement procedure. 
 
3. Results and Discussions

desired one. This restriction is numerically proven 
by an assign set of data. It is believed that, with the 
proposed theory, the study of evaluating the 
representative polynomial of a smooth set of data 
point can be started. The application of the 
polynomial to enhance the accuracy of the 
numerical solution, the iterative strategy works very 
well as shown in a numerical test case.

I. Introduction 
 
Rapid developments of computer software and hardware have opened many new fields such as the numerical 
analysis, data analysis, data mining, and etc… Most of these fields become practical issues today. For example, 
numerical solutions of the ordinary and partial differential equations are familiar cases [1-6]. For the latter problems, 
after ensuring the stability and consistency conditions, the first thought to most people is to refine the mesh so as to 
ensure the mesh independence of the numerical solution [1, 7, 8]. In order to achieve the independence as easy as 
possible, many extremely high order schemes have been developed and obtained bright achievements [9-32]. 
Principally speaking, they use the finite element, finite difference, or finite volume method. Recently, for the sake of 
achieving the truly high order accuracy, the spectral methods developed by Wang et al. [26-31] used the technique 
of the polynomial reconstruction [17, 19] to calculate all the necessary variables and fluxes. Their works achieve 
great successes because they employed the completely expanded polynomials of finite degree. When the grid 
independence and code validation via experimental data are satisfactory, therefore, these spectral methods are 
reliable for most engineering problems provided that the necessary numerical diffusions are properly addressed. 
Since to conduct an experiment takes a long time and costs a lot of money, only limited experimental data is 
available. Thus, once a few typical numerical solutions are validated, all the other numerical solutions, whose 
conditions and parameters are moderately deviated from typical ones, are considered corrected results. However, the 
correctness of these un-validated solutions is not very solid.

2.1 Evaluating Truncation Error of Numerical Solution 
 
Consider a smooth two dimensional data set, ,),,( Sfyx iii  where Ni ,...,1,0 . They are generated from a 
smooth function ),( yxff  within a domain, D , where ),( ii yx and if  are the coordinates and dependent variable 
at the i th data point, respectively, and some data points are distributed along the boundary, D . Here ),( ii yx also 
denotes the structured and/or unstructured grid system, if represents one of the numerical solutions, and ),( yxf is 
the continuous function corresponding to all the if s. In order to restrict the present study on the topic of precisely 
estimating the T. E. of a numerical solution, assume that grid distribution of ),( iii yxff  is properly arranged so as 
to resolve all the features of ),( yxf . This means that the grid system is fine enough and that all the curvatures of 
the surface )),(,,( yxfyx are substantially resolved by the data of S . According to the Weierstrass approximation 
theorem [2, 4-6], one can find a polynomial properly approximating to the smooth function, ),( yxf .

For the sake of practical application, the following definitions are made. 
 
Def. 2.1 Simple Smooth Function 
 
),( yxf is said to be a simple smooth function for all Dyx ),(  if it can be properly approximated by a 
polynomial of Eq.(2.1) and if there exists a positive integer M  for a given 0 such that 
 || , kJka  for all MJ   and Jk ,...,1,0                                                                                                (2.3) 
In other words, the series expansion should have a convergent sum by summing up finite terms without applying any 
transformation. 
 
Def. 2.2 Extremely Smooth Function  
 
),( yxf is said to be extremely smooth in D  if it is a simple continuous function and satisfies the following 
properties. 
 
1. The function in D contains at most one extreme point, a ridge line, or a gorge line. 
2. Consider )),(,,( yxfyx as a three dimensional surface within D . Let r be the longest distance from the central 
point of D  to any point on the boundary, D . The surface has at least one of the following properties. (a) 
|| minmax ff  is very small. (b) There is a plane which properly approximates the surface.  Along the normal 
direction of the plane, the maximum difference between the surface and the approximating plane is very small. (c) 
At every point of D , the radii of curvature of the curved surface, )),(,,( yxfyx , are much larger than r . 
3. The magnitude of the high order partial derivative of the function at any point of D  rapidly decays as the order 
is larger than two or any other small positive integer. Ortherwise, for the Taylor series expansion of ),( yxf with 
respect to a point of D , the magnitudes of the high order terms rapidly decay as the order increases. 
 
A simple smooth function may be an extremely smooth function. Otherwise, by properly dividing the domain 
of a simple smooth function into many sub-domains, it shall become extremely smooth within every sub-domain. 
Consider the data in S  whose grid density is fine enough.  They represent an extremely smooth function if the first

them. The following fundamental theorems of evaluating the T.E. of the numerical solution by solving a partial 
differential equation can then be derived and proven.  
 
Theorem 2.1 
 
Consider a data set S  generated from a simple smooth function, ),( yxff  . These points are fine enough to 
represent all the features of ),( yxf . Next, all the points of S are divided into two subsets 1S and 2S which are 
arranged according to the above mentioned rules. The data points of the subset 1S are also fine enough to resolve the 
whole S . These points are used to generate the interpolation polynomial of Eq.(2.4). Assume at these interpolation 
points, a stable solution of  kJka , s offer a finite and small constant iP  such that

where   is an estimation of the machine error of the computing device. Besides, there exists another finite and 
small constant  cP  such that 
        cjjj Pyxzf  |),(|                                                                                                                              (2.7), 
where ic PP   and ),( jj yx s are coordinates of those points in 2S  whose number of points is LN  . If LN 2 , 
there exists a finite constant K  such that 
        Kyxzyxf  |),(),(|  for all Dyx ),(                                                                                               (2.8) 
As N , Eq.(2.7) is true such that the magnitude of K  is in the same order of magnitude of cP . 
 
Proof: 
 
Since Eq.(2.6) is valid for all the interpolation points of 1S , the round-off error is not significantly amplified by 
the ill-conditioned property of the Vandermonde matrix during the solution procedure. 
 
Next, consider an interpolation point ),( rr yx in 1S  as the temporary reference point. The Taylor series 
expansions of ),( yxf and the polynomial are, respectively,

The last approximation is valid because ),( yxf  is a simple smooth function. If LN  , Eq.(2.10) is over-
determined. One can choose ])!1(!/[)!1(  LNLN difference combinations of simultaneous equations whose 
right-handed-side are almost zero to solve for all the partial derivatives of Eq.(2.10). These facts mean that all the 
partial derivatives of ),(),( yxzyxf   in the right-handed side of the last equation are bounded. Otherwise one or 
more than one equations of Eqs.(2.7) and (2.8) must be violated. 
 
The deviation e  can be rewritten in the following forms.

derivatives of ),( yxf are infinitesimal. The proof of Theorem 2.1 shows that the high order partial derivatives of
zf  are infinitesimal as N . Consequently, the corresponding high order derivatives of ),( yxz are 
infinitesimal too. Accordingly, ),( yxz coincides with ),( yxf in D with infinitesimal error. Consequently, the 
theorem is proven. ■ 
 
Numerical experiments show that the evaluation of the reconstructed polynomial for a smooth function is 
frequently suffered from the serious interference of the round-off error. On the other hand, for an extremely function, 
most of these evaluations are available when the interpolation range D is properly chosen. To show this fact, the 
following one-dimensional extremely smooth function is examined by the interpolation procedure via the Newton 
divided difference interpolation method.

The interpolation points starts from 1024/1x  with a uniform interval of 1024/45x . If the interpolation point 
goes beyond 5x , it is fold back by taking the point xx 1052 as a reflection mirror. The solid line shown in the 
upper figure of Fig.1 is the original function (denoted as y ). For the long dash and dotted lines in the regions of 
xx  271  and xx  496 , the resulting polynomials become the extrapolation forms, respectively. Therefore, they 
are significantly deviates from the original data. Their distributions of the approximation error are plotted in the 
bottom figure of Fig.1 and quantitatively shown the corresponding error order. The resulting polynomial of using 16 
interpolation points is an extrapolation in region where 5721  xx . However, the error cannot be clearly seen in 
the top figure. It is interested to see that the case of using 23 interpolation points attains the minimum error in which 
errors at all the checking points are less than 1210 . Moreover, the maximum error approximately occurs at the 
center of the interval in between two successive interpolation points which confirms the phenomenon shown in 
Ref.[6]. The case of using 26 points gives a larger error distribution than that of the 23 points. The reason is that the 
round-off error plays a key role of the error performance when too many interpolation points are used. As shown in 
Ref.[33], because of the error accumulation, the error performance of applying the Lagrangian interpolation is much 
worse than that that using the Newton divided difference method and is not discussed here. 
 
Those shown in Fig.2 are the resulting absolute errors of the approximating polynomials using several 
interpolation points. Since the data in the set 1S  are not fine enough for the function over the entire range of 
50  x , errors of 6, 8, 10, and 16 interpolating points cannot reach the machine error level. The error of the case 
using 23 interpolating points achieves the machine error level as shown.  
 
In Figs.3a and 4a, errors of the two and four segment approaches (with 23 interpolating points) are shown, 
respectively. Now )(xf becomes more smooth in every sub-domain than that in the original data span. In spite of the 
fact that the interpolating range is shrink, the error level of these figures are roughly the same. Therefore, it is judged 
that their errors are in the machine error level. These figures show a fact that, once the number of interpolating point 
and data span are properly arranged, any reduction of the interpolating range cannot further reduce the 
approximating error significantly. As the interpolating points are reduced to be 16, the resulting error distribution of 
the two segment case is shown in Fig.3b and is only slightly worse than that of Fig.3a. For the four segment case, 
the 10 interpolating point case shown in Fig.4b is only slightly worse than the error level of Fig.4a as shown. 
Therefore, after properly restrict the interpolation regions, the cases of employing 10, 11, or 12 interpolating points 
are suitable for the two-dimensional problems. 
 
This example gives several important and well known properties. 
 
(1) The performance of using the interpolation is better than that of the extrapolation. 
(2) The interpolation range together with the number of interpolation points (say the maximum degree M of Eq.(2.4)) 
are related factors. Generally speaking, a low degree interpolation polynomial cannot precisely resolve the 
original function even it is extremely smooth. However, by properly dividing the original data span into several 
sub-domains, the function can be locally represented by a low degree reconstructed polynomial. 
(3) When the interpolation function is extremely smooth within the interpolation range, it is recommended to put the 
error checking point approximately at the center of the region surrounded by all nearby interpolation points. 
Thus, only a limited number of error checking point, say LN  1 L , is sufficient to check whether the 
approximation error is in the machine error or not.

4. If Eqs.(2.6) and (2.7) are valid for all the corresponding points, evaluate all the necessary partial derivatives of 
the interested partial differential equation(s). 
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for all the D s. Note that all the D s can be dynamically adjusted during the iteration 
procedure.  
 
It is well known that to approximate the function )251/(1 2x via a uniformly distributed interpolation points is 
much worse than that using the points associated to the roots of a proper orthogonal polynomial [6]. Therefore, one 
has better to choose additional points on or around the enclosed boundary D  of D as the interpolation points of 
1S . In the following content, the proposed method of quantitatively evaluating the T.E. is applying to enhance the 
solution accuracy by solving a Laplace equation problem within a uniformly distributed rectangular mesh system. 
 
When a numerical solution cannot be validated by available experimental data, the present method is a potential 
tool to examine whether the corresponding T.E. is satisfactory or not. In general, if an extremely high order scheme 
such as the spectral method of Wang et al [26-32] is used, one only needs to check the T.E. in some isolated regions 
with complicated or unknown physical property and in regions where the mesh quality is not satisfactory. For a low 
order scheme, the proposed tool of estimating the T.E. suggests a method to significantly suppress the final T.E. of 
the numerical simulation.

such that the numerical equation should consist with the original partial differential equation and the solution 
procedure must be stable [1]. In order to fix the non-uniqueness problem of ref.[34], a multiple one dimensional 
interpolating method was proposed. For the sake of completeness, these materials are briefly stated in the following 
section.  
2.3 Non-Uniqueness of Two-dimensional Interpolating Polynomial  
 
In Ref.[34],  the following function is employed to generate a series of data points.

Next, the following two interpolating polynomials are separately assumed to be the interpolating polynomials whose 
coefficients are to be determined by 9 points among the given data points.

Obviously, Eq.(2.25) uses the same form of polynomial as Eq.(2.24). On the other hand, Eq.(2.26) takes slightly 
different form because the 3x term is replaced by the 3y term. These interpolating relations were solved by the 
Gaussian elimination method with row-pivoting in Ref.[34]. Except the interpolating points, the error level of the 
interpolating polynomial using Eq.(2.25) is about 1210  but that employing Eq.(2.26) is roughly equal to 310 . 
Therefore, one should at least use the same form of the original function which is generally not known a priori. 
 
In addition to this example, several fundamentals related to the non-uniqueness were also derived in Ref.[34]. 
The main difficulty is that the suitable highest degree M of Eq.(2.3) is an unknown parameter. In a subsequent 
study [38], it was found that we must guess a large enough M in Eq.(2.4) to fix the problem of non-uniqueness 
provided that the polynomial should be completely expanded. Unfortunately, to the author’s knowledge, there is not 
any simple strategy except the iterative method. As a first study, this issue is partially skipped by using a multiple-
one dimensional interpolation procedure discussed below. For convenience, how to choose the interpolation and 
checking points from a smooth data set [33] is first restated in the following section. 
2.4  Selecting Interpolation points from One Dimensional Data 
 
In Ref.[6], it was pointed that, by the use of interpolating points associated to the Legendre polynomial’s roots, 
the Runge phenomenon can be suppressed to certain extend. Moreover, it is shown that the oscillatory deviation 
attains the maximum magnitude in the interval between two interpolation points next to an end. In addition, the 
maximum magnitude gradually decays as the interval moves inward. These properties are verified by the above 
discussions of Figs.1 through Fig.4 which test the one-dimensional function of Eq.(2.12). According to Corollary 2.1 
and these facts, the resulting interpolation points of 1S should be similar to the following relations.

where the superscript denotes the index of the interpolating points. In other words, one or more than one checking 
points should be put in between two successive interpolation points.This rule ensures that, for the sake of properly 
checking the Runge oscillatory phenomenon, N must be larger than 12 L . 
2.5 Generation of Multiple One Dimensional Interpolating Polynomial 
 
Suppose an extremely smooth function ),( yxf  is defined on a rectangular grid system where ),( ,, jiji yx =
),( yjxi  , Ii ...,,1,0 , Jj ,...,1,0  and 12, JI . For convenience, the reference point ),( 00 yx is set to be )0,0( . 
These data are elements in 1S  which is a subset of the original data set S and I and J are related to the above 
mentioned L  of Eqs.(2.5) and (2.27).  At first, along every grid line of yjy  , a one-dimensional interpolating 
polynomial is generated by the Newton divided difference interpolation method [33]. After completing the sweeping, 
the following polynomials are obtained.

Under this constraint, the rules of §2.1 and that of §2.4 are interpreted as the following iterative strategy of 
determining the vertical patch boundaries. 
 
1. Choose all the interpolating points according to the rule of Eq.(2.27) and evaluate the corresponding divided 
differences of the first and second orders. 
2. If two or several successive first and second order divided differences are roughly equal to one another and their 
left or right neighbor has significantly large or small magnitude of the corresponding divided differences, they are 
considered as a patch without any one of these neighbors. 
3. A patch with large magnitudes of divided differences should not contain one or two points with very small 
magnitude of the divided differences. 
4. If the first order divided differences are very small or very close to a constant value over a certain region, it is 
chosen to be a patch. 
5.   Properly adjust the patch boundary so that every grid line satisfies those stated in item 2, 3, and 4. 
6. On the same grid line, generate the approximating polynomial of every patch and examine if all the 
approximating errors roughly close to error tolerance. Otherwise adjust the patch boundaries. If necessary, add 
more patches to reduce the approximating error. 
Along every data string of Eq.(2.29), the same rules are applied to define the horizontal patch boundaries. 
 
This approach introduces infinitesimal data jumps along the common boundary of two neighboring patches. 
Note that jumps of the corresponding derivatives are amplified as their order increases because of the negative effect 
of the round-off error upon the differential operators. Numerical tests show that a suitable overlapping region uses 
3q  for a real*8 computing to obtain an acceptable magnitude of all the jumps. Note that, as a suitable patch 
arrangement is chosen, the related evaluations of the T.E. in all the patches are mutually independent. Therefore, the 
algorithm of the parallel computing can be easily implemented. 
 
III. Results and Discussions 
 
3.1 Two-Dimensional Reconstructed Polynomial 
 
The exact solution of Eq.(2.14) with the following parameter was used to examine the interpolating properties: 
)...,,( 50 aa (0.1, 05.0  , 0.013, 0.026, 017.0 ) and )...,,( 50 bb )037.0,045.0,,053.0,025.0,2.0(  . At first, the 
88  patches were considered as an example. In Fig.5a through 5c, the resulting magnitude distributions of the 
coefficients, kla , of the patch in the left-low corner with respect to their indices k  and l  are plotted with different 
number of interpolating points. It is seen that, as the number of interpolating points along a direction increases, the 
property of the attenuation of the coefficients with respect to the increase of k and/or l is gradually destroyed by the 
round-off error’s interference. Fortunately, when the deteriorating effect is not serious, the resulting approximating 
error is not serious too as shown in Fig.6 where 12 interpolating points along x and y directions were employed. 
In the interior region of Fig.6, all the large approximating error regions around boundaries of interpolation regions 
are in the overlapping strips and beyond patch boundaries so that they are ultimately removed by the rules of §2.4 
and §2.6. Consequently, the error in the interior region is less than 1510 and then any point can be considered as the 
error checking point. The approximating error of the interpolating polynomial around the boundaries is larger than 
that in the interior region about 2 to 3 order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the maximum error is about 1310 which is 
still satisfactory.  Therefore, both 8 and 12 interpolating points are considered in the following content.  
3.2 Accuracy Enhancement of Finite Difference Solution for Laplace Equation  
 
The finite difference solution of Eq.(2.15) with the coefficients mentioned in previous section was first carried 
out with the help of the FAS multi-grid algorithm [35-37] and then improved by the proposed enhancing algorithm. 
Errors of the original numerical solution, the second and twenty-fourth cycles are shown in Figs.7a and 7b, where 
the former is in the regular view and the latter is plotted from another view of the distributions. The solution 
procedure used 12 interpolating points, 88  patches, and 256256  uniform grid points. It is obviously that the

sub-domains, the numerical solution should be an extremely smooth function within every sub-domain and can 
be properly resolved by the interpolation points, and the error of the reconstruction can be properly checked at 
points around every interpolation point. 
2. For two-dimensional numerical solution on a rectangular grid system, the multiple-one dimensional interpolation 
is a candidate to generate the reconstructed polynomial. It effectively fixes the unique problem of the two-
dimensional interpolation polynomial with the penalty of suffering from the accumulation of the round-off error. 
In other words, the calculation should be carefully handled by the double or even higher precision 
3. The suitable number of interpolating points for the Newton divided difference method for the multiple one-
dimensional interpolation method is from 10 to 12 points. 
4. The method of accurately calculating the T.E. is successfully used to suppress the final approximating error of 
the finite differenced Laplace equation and hence the accuracy of the numerical solution. 
5. The proposed accuracy enhancement strategy can reduce the solution error of the Laplace equation problem but 
required much longer computing time than that of the original numerical method. The impulsively distributed 
residue around a boundary blocks the efficiency of the error reduction that should be carefully improved in the 
further studies. 
 
IV. Conclusion 
 
A universal algorithm of precisely evaluating the T.E. is developed. Subsequently, it is successfully applied to 
enhance for the solution accuracy of a two-dimensional Laplace equation problem. The penalty is that the required 
computing resource is significantly increased. There is still a problem that should be addressed in the application of 
the proposed method. Nevertheless, it seems that the proposed method has the potential of effectively suppressing 
the T.E. for solving the two- and three-dimensional partial differential problems. In particular, if the proposed 
algorithm is properly equipped with any numerical scheme and is computed with a long enough significant figure, 
the numerical solution has the potential to be a valid solution. In other words, after reasonable interactions between 
the solution procedures with experimental data, one has the chance of identifying both physical properties and 
relations of many problems.
