1. General Description of the Program 
This three-year project proposes the single chip solution based on CMOS 
technology for X- and K-Band frequency modulation continuous wave radar system 
(FMCW). In the first year, the CMOS transceiver is designed for the 
multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) antenna system, realizing the two-dimensional, 
analog signal processing FMCW radar in X-Band. The completed transceiver, which 
includes the building blocks of voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), low-noise amplifier 
(LNA), mixer, transmission-line (TL) based active bandpass filter, TL-based power 
divider, are realized in the single CMOS chip. The transmitter can directly generate the 
output signal with frequency modulation at 10.525 GHz. In the receiver, the 
analog-based delta-sigma signal processing is realized before the down-converter. The 
practical estimations on the antenna design and electrical characteristics of radar chip 
are also reported in details. In the second year, a single chip of FMCW transceiver at 
K-band is designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. The transceiver, 
which consists of one transmitter and one receiver, can connect with two individual 
antenna arrays and simultaneously transmit the modulated signal at K-band and receiver 
the reflected signal from the object. The building blocks of the transceiver, which 
include multi-stage amplifier (MSA), voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), orthogonal 
signal generation、up-conversion mixer、down-conversion mixer、active bandpass 
filter (ABPF), power divider, are individually designed and characterized before the 
(System on Chip, SOC) integration. In the third years, the project focused on developing 
the on-chip guiding structure, named the complementary-conducting-strip coupled line 
(CCS CL) to realize more building blocks for the RF signal processing in the sensor 
applications. These analog blocks, which include the variable attenuator, phase shifter, 
and delay line, are applied to implement the feedforward loop in the front-end of the 
transceiver in K-band for suppressing the leakage of the signal paths. 
2. Breakthrough and Major Achievements 
This project focus on developing the advanced on-chip synthesized transmission 
lines and successfully implements the large-scaled system-on-chip (SoC) based these 
guiding techniques for the integrated sensor applications in the radio frequency bands. 
These advance guiding structures are regarded as the basic elements to construct the 
building blocks of the transceivers and provide the well-defined reference potential for 
the interconnections inside the SoC. Additionally all the building blocks for the RF 
signal processing in the sensor applications, including the amplifier, mixer, active 
bandpass filter, power divider, hybrids, variable attenuator, phase shifter, and delay line,

III. K-Band CMOS Front-End Device Incorporating Feedforward Techniques for 
Signal Antenna Transceiver 
 
 The innovative architecture of the RF front-end circuit for single antenna 
transceiver is reported to break the structural limitation on the leakage suppression. A 
practical prototype is implemented at K-band and fabricated by using standard 0.18-m 
1P6M CMOS technology. The comparisons between simulations and on-wafer 
measurements are reported in detail to confirm the feasibility and capability of the 
proposed architecture. At 24 GHz, the prototype has dual transmission gains of 22.4 and 
12.3 dB in the transmitting and receiving paths, respectively. The measured isolation, 
which is defined by the ratio of the forward transmission to reverse transmission 
coefficient in the same path, is higher than 50.0 dB at 24.0 GHz. By comparing the 
leakage phenomena between the prototype with and without feedforward cancellations, 
the leakage suppression can be improved with a maximum value of 44.7 dB at 23.63 
GHz. 
 
IV. K-Band 0.18-m 1P6M CMOS Active Bandpass Filter Using Complementary 
Current-Reuse Pair 
A low-power active Bandpass filter (BPF) at K-band is fabricated by the standard 
0.18 m 1P6M CMOS technology. The proposed filter is evolved from the conventional 
half-wavelength resonator filter, using the complementary-conducting—strip 
transmission line (CCS TL) as the half- wavelength resonator. Furthermore, the 
complementary MOS cross-couple pair is proposed as a form of current-reuse scheme 
for achieving low-power consumption and high Q-factor simultaneously. The proposed 
active BPF of order two occupies the chip area of 360 m 360 m without contact pads. 
The measured results show that the center frequency of the active BPF is 22.70 GHz 
and a bandwidth of 1.68 GHz (7.39 %). The measured 1 dB and noise figure at 22.70 
GHz are 7.65 dBm and 14.05 dB, respectively. There is a 56.84 dB suppression between 
the fundamental tone and the second harmonic when the input power is 11.26 dBm. 
While showing 0 dB loss and some residual gain, the active BPF consumes 2.0 mA at 
1.65 V supply voltage with maximum of 0.15 dB insertion loss and 9.96 dB return loss 
at pass band. 
 
V. K-Band CMOS Miniaturized Phase-Invertible Variable Attenuator 
A CMOS miniaturized phase-invertible variable attenuator (PIVA) consists of one 
3-dB transmission line (TL) based directional coupler, two NMOS transistors, and 
simple matching network. The technique of complex impedance matching is proposed 
 7
processes. The measured tuning range on the group delay confirms the predictions 
given by the design equations.

Appendix II: Technical Content 
I. Introduction 
Rapid advances in silicon processes make system-on-chip (SOC) possible [1]–[3]. 
Scalable CMOS technologies are inexpensive, highly integrated, and reliable, especially 
in digital circuits. Recent studies indicate that most RF transceivers of single-chip 
[4]–[11] or chip-set [12]–[15] frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) radars 
adopted for range or velocity detection were designed at W-band for chip size, antenna 
size and transmission characteristic considerations. Furthermore, most of the monolithic 
microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) were realized by pseudomorphic HEMTs 
(pHEMT) [4]–[6] or dual-gate pHEMT [7] due to their high transit frequency, 
maximum oscillation frequency, and good isolation characteristics on gallium arsenide 
(GaAs) substrate. In the past, coplanar waveguide (CPW) technology was often applied 
to radar applications, for its easier flip-chip package and integration than microstrip line 
[16], [17]. FMCW sensors that integrate two antennas, hybrid circuits and CMOS single 
chip for short-range detection have been developed recently [18], [19]. In this three-year 
project, we accomplished three single-chip CMOS transceivers, including the X-band 
monopulse sensor for connecting three antennas, the K-band FMCW sensor for two 
antenna, and K-band sensor with feedforward technique for single antenna system. The 
core passive and active building blocks in these transceiers, including the 90 hybrid, 180 
hybrid, the resonators of the active bandpass filter (BPF), the vector-sum based phase 
shifter, the reflection-type attenuator, the variable delay line, the oscillator, the 
multi-stage amplifier and the mixer, are constructed by the on-chip synthesized 
transmission lines (TLs). The low susceptibility, slow propagation, high flexibility, and 
integration characteristics of the synthetic TLs make them suitable for the 
monolithically integrated designs, and demonstrate that the capability of overcoming the 
size limit imposed by Maxwell’s equations [20]–[23]. The measured results show that 
the X-band transceiver has more than 60 dB isolations between T/R, a 35-dB second 
harmonic suppression in the transmitter. The amplitude and phase imbalance of I/Q 
signals are 0.6 dB and 7o, respectively. The first K-band transceiver has more than 55 
dB isolations between transmitter and receier, a 42 dB second harmonic suppression in 
the transmitter. The amplitude and phase imbalance of I/Q signals are 1.2 dB and 4.2o. 
The second K-band prototype has 22.4 dB and 12.3 dB transmission gains in 
transmitting and receiving paths. The leakage suppresison between two paths is 44.7 dB 
at 23.63 GHz.

decreased from 45.8 Ω to 24.8 Ω. The maximum K of TFCL is 0.65. On the other hand, 
the black curve represents the CCS CL with Wh of 29.5 um. The maximum and 
minimum values of the Z0e are 139.8 Ω and 78.3 Ω. The maximum and minimum values 
of Z0o are 45.9 Ω and 20.4 Ω, respectively. Therefore, the maximum K of the CCS CL is 
0.7. The comparisons between the black and grey curves show that the proposed CCS 
CL can improve the K of 7.7 % with the identical line-width and line spacing to those of 
the TFML. Moreover, Fig. 2(b) shows the extracted results of the CCS CL with 
different metal thickness of the mesh ground plane. The comparisons between the black 
and grey curves in Fig. 2(b) show that K of the CCS CL can be controlled by only 
adjusting the thickness of the mesh ground plane. When h is increased from 0.9 m to 
6.7 m, K is increased from 0.28 to 0.7. Fig. 2(b) shows the proposed CCS CL can 
achieve wider range of K than that of the TFCL.

The grey curve shows that the SWFe and SWFo can be equalized by properly choosing 
the S and W of the CCS CL. The design curves reported in Fig. 4 demonstrate that phase 
velocity equalization of edged-coupled TLs can be realized using monolithic CMOS 
techniques for the first time. Additionally, Fig. 3 shows that the increasing of the IMD 
thickness slightly affects on the k, revealing the orthogonal syntheses on the phase 
velocity equalization. This structural parameter of the CCS CL is reported for first time 
to demonstrate its capability on the phase velocity syntheses. As reported in this section, 
the proposed CCS CL provides a high flexibility for synthesizing the desired guiding 
characteristics.

B. X-band CMOS FMCW Monopulse Radar 
As stated before, difficulties in reducing the chip area of an RF transceiver make 
its cost can’t be scaled down with scalable CMOS technology. Passive components and 
circuits such as inductors and hybrids generally dominate the chip area of an RF 
transceiver. In this transceiver, inductors and TL based hybrids are implemented by 
meandered CCS TLs. Due to the distances between the switch and output ports of the 
rat-race are far away. Therefore, the impedance transformation network (ITN), or 
 19
transceiver integrating 16 building blocks is merely 2.6 mm  3.3 mm, including all 
contact pads. The layout of the chip can be summarized as follows, 
a. Independent power lines for transmitter and receiver to prevent mutual coupling. 
Both transmitter and receiver have two power lines, or pads sharing power 
consumption as equally as possible. 
b. Thick and wide power lines are composed of metal 6 and metal 5 provide stable 
voltage supply, prevent from electro-migration and IR-drop.  
c. The most power consumption circuits are near to the power pads as possible. The 
power pads of the transmitter are close to the VCO and amplifiers to provide the 
power supply.  
d. Bypass capacitors are added as many as possible to ground noise and meet design 
rules of metal density. In the layout, bypass capacitors are added along power lines. 
e. Separate the RF, IF and dc signals. RF, IF and dc signals are isolated with each 
other by dummy metals as possible. 
f. Make the unwanted coupled lines as short as possible. 
g. Use meshed ground plane in the entire chip to avoid vertical couplings through the 
silicon substrate. 
h. Use dummy metals to meet metal density rules and avoid horizontal couplings 
between adjacent circuits. 
i. Make the chip as square for ease of external routing or packaging. 
 
The simulated transmission coefficients between transmitter and receiver are 
characterized by full-chip EM field analyses with AnsoftTM HFSS simulator as shown in 
Fig. 5(a). The transmission coefficients with and without CCS ground plane shielding 
between TX and RX1 are -40 dB and -64 dB, respectively, demonstrating 24-dB 
improvement around 10.5 GHz. Similarly, the transmission coefficient with and without 
CCS ground plane shielding between TX and RX2 are -58 dB and -74 dB, respectively, 
demonstrating 16-dB improvement around 10.5 GHz. The leakage phenomena in the 
transceiver are then experimentally investigated by measuring the isolations between TX, 
RX1 and RX2. The transceiver is switched fully on, and a modulated signal is injected 
into the VCO to generate an FMCW signal with a 50-MHz spread spectrum at TX. The 
measured FMCW signals at RX1 and RX2, as shown in Fig. 5(b), are leakages from TX 
 21
A conventional monopulse architecture is two receiving antennas followed in 
sequence by a rat-race hybrid, a switch, and an LNA. However, a rat-race hybrid, and a 
switch implemented in CMOS process is too lossy degrading the NF of the receiver. 
Therefore, the proposed architecture is two receiving antennas, followed in sequence by 
two LNAs, a rat-race hybrid, and a switch. The LNA in the receiver provides 20-dB 
gain and 6.5-dB NF. Furthermore, the measured insertion loss, or the NF of the rat-race 
and switch are 4.3 dB and 3.0 dB, respectively. Moreover, the equivalent NF from 
active BPF to Gilbert-cell mixers is 19.5 dB. Table I summarizes the measured gain and 
the measured NF of each building block in the receiver. Therefore, the calculated and 
measured NFs of the proposed receiver are 9.7 dB and 11.5 dB. A difference of 1.8 dB 
is observed between the calculated and measured results due to the losses of 
interconnections in the receiver. As mentioned above, the conventional architecture 
would feature 14.6-dB NF calculated by measured NF of each building block in the 
receiver. Thus the receiver provides 3.1-dB NF better than that of conventional 
monopulse receiver.

The switching and filtering capabilities of the receiver chain are tested from the 
input of the LNA1, or RX1 to the output of the WPD3, or Tap through a small capacitor. 
The control voltage of the switch is 1.5 V for the on-state, and 0 V for the off-state. 
When the switch turns on, or connects to Σ port, the overall transmission coefficient of 
the receiver chain is -17 dB. When the switch turns off, the in-band impedance 
mismatches between the active BPF and the switch result the overall transmission 
coefficient of -47 dB, as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, the switching capability 
demonstrates 30-dB isolation at 10.5 GHz. Due to the integrated active BPF, the

The amplitude and phase imbalances of I/Q signals are characterized in time 
domain with Pin of -75.5 dBm, as shown in Fig. 9. The amplitudes of I/Q signals are 4.3 
mV and 4.6 mV with 1-MΩ load, respectively. The approximate amplitude and phase 
imbalance are 0.6 dB and 7°, respectively. The amplitude and phase imbalance are 
mainly affected by the asymmetrical layout of the interfacial interconnects in the 
receiver. Table II summarizes the characteristics of the transceiver for X-band 
monopulse radar.

the substrate. The necessary dummy metals, which can be observed in the chip area of 
the adjacent pads, are filled for meeting the requirement of metal densities defined by 
the processes rules.

The measured results, which exclude the parasitics of the contacting pads, are 
compared with those of the circuit simulations, showing the following observations. 
When the Vctrl is increased from 0 to 1.8 V with a step of 0.05 V, as shown in Fig. 12(a), 
measured and simulated input return losses, which are represented by the black curves 
and dots, are changed from -10.2 to -14.7 dB and -13.3 to -17.7 dB at 24 GHz, 
respectively. Similarly, measured and simulated output return losses, which are 
represented by blue curves and dots, are changed from -11.2 to -14.9 dB and -13.1 to 
-19 dB at 24 GHz, respectively. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 12(b), both 
measured and simulated attenuations, which are represented by blue curves and dots, are 
nearly kept as a constant value from 20 to 28 GHz. The blue dots in Fig. 12(b) shows 
the minimum and maximum values of attenuation are -6.6 dB and -31.0 dB based on the 
simulation. Similarly, the measured results, which are represented by the blue curves in 
Fig. 12(b), are increased from -7.1 dB to -29.9 dB. The comparison shown in Figure 
12(b), which reveals the measured dynamic range of the attenuations, is fall into that of 
the simulations, confirm the function of the prototype on attenuation control. 
Moreover, Fig. 12(c) shows the performances of the prototype on the phase

D. 24 GHz Vector-Sum Based Phase Shifter 
Figure 13 shows the schematic of the phase shifter based on the vector-sum 
method. The building blocks include one 3-dB directional coupler, two identical 
phase-invertible variable attenuators (PIVAs), and one 3-dB power combiner. The 
reference impedance of all the building blocks is equal to 50 ohm. The phase shifting is 
accomplished by combining two vector signals after performing the signal processing in 
the complex domain. The processing is initiated by performing the in-phase and 
quadrature-phase decomposition of the input signal with the coupler (C1). After 
decomposing the input signal, the two output signals of the coupler (C1) enter into two 
PIVAs. The PIVA performs the magnitude adjustments of the input signal with either 
in-phase or out-of-phase shifting. Finally, the power combiner gathers the signals at the 
outputs of two PIVAs to complete the processes. 
 
Fig. 13 The schematic of the vector-sum based phase shifter. Design parameters of the 
proposed phase shifter are following: the length and width of M1(M2, M3, M4,) are 0.3 
m and 48 m, respectively. The characteristic impedance and electrical length of T1(T2, 
T3, T4) are 50.2  and 13.2o,respectively. The resistance of Rp1 (Rp2, Rp2, Rp4) is 200 . 
The even- and odd- mode characteristic impedances of the C1 (C2, C3) are 143.8  and 
25.2 , respectively.  
As shown in Fig. 13, the 3-dB directional coupler is realized by the meandered 
edge-coupled complementary-conducting strip coupled lines (CCS CLs) [32]. The even- 
and odd-mode guiding characteristics are synthesized by the five structural parameters 
of the CCS CL. In this presented design, the period of the unit cell is 30 m with a mesh 
 31
combinations of the control voltages for VC1 and VC2 are set to measure the two-port 
scattering parameters for covering full 360o phase shifting. The ranges of the control 
voltages are from 0.21 to 0.66 V and from 0.74 to 1.76 V, respectively. The CMOS 
prototype has a RMS phase error less than 1.5o, 0.45 dB of RMS magnitude variation, 
and 6.3 ps of the group-delay deviation from 22.0 to 26.0 GHz. The measured input P1dB 
and IIP3 of the prototype are 12.0 and 28.0 dBm, respectively.

The on-wafer measurements for the proposed CMOS VDL were conducted by using 
the vector network analyzer, E8361C PNA, AgilentTM. When the VC is increased from 0 
to 2 V, as shown in Fig. 17(a), the measured and simulated input return losses are 
changed from 17.9 to 18.5 dB and from 17.4 to 19.5 dB at 24 GHz, respectively. The 
measured and simulated output return losses are changed from 14.9 to 16.0 dB and from 
15.2 to 16.2 dB at 24 GHz, respectively. As shown in Fig. 17(b), the measured and 
simulated insertion losses are changed from 11.6 to 13.8 dB and from 11.0 dB to 14.8 
dB at 24 GHz during the group delay adjustment, respectively. Referring to Fig. 4, the 
proposed CMOS VDL keeps the impedance matching at two RF ports, and has low 
magnitude variation of 2.2 dB during the group delay adjustment. However, the 
variation of the insertion losses is due to the parasitic resistors of the varactors. 
Moreover, Fig. 18 shows the capability of the proposed VDL on the group delay tuning. 
The curves of the measured results show that the tuning range of the group delay is 87.1 
ps. The experimental results of the prototype show a good agreement with those of the 
simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed topology for improving on the 
tuning range of the group delay.

G. 24 GHz sensor with feedforward technique 
Figure 21 shows the 24 GHz sensor with feedforward technique based on standard 
0.18 m 1P6M CMOS technology, consisting of four-stage common-source amplifiers 
(AMP1-AMP4) in a chip area of 1940 m by 1660 m including pads. The feedforward 
path, which is realized by the magnitude/phase control unit (MPCU), consists of two 
phase shifter and one attenuator. The sensor is fully shielded by the mesh ground plane 
of the synthetic transmission lines (TLs), thereby eliminating the coupling through the 
silicon substrate substantially. The connections between the adjacent components are 
realized by the complementary-conducting-strip transmission line (CCS TL) with a 50 
 characteristic impedance to support the well-defined electromagnetic propagation. 
Inside the building blocks, either TL elements or coupled lines are randomly arranged in 
the meandered form for the compactness. The dummy metals are also filled into the 
prototype to maintain the global metal density of 30.0 % for each metal layer [21]. As 
shown in Fig. 21, the architectures of the components, which include the amplifiers 
(AMP1-AMP4) and active bandpass filter (ABPF), are identical to those of reported in 
the [33] and [34]. This amplifier had demonstrated the highest gain-area efficiency with 
CCS TL using 0.18 m CMOS technology at 24 GHz. The proposed sensor integrates 
the ABPF as the first stage of the input in the transmitting path. This feature can assist 
in suppressing the harmonic signals generated from the transmitting terminal, resulting 
in the output spectrums with good quality at antenna terminal. The half-wavelength 
resonators of the ABPF are constructed by the CCS TL and the complementary 
current-reuse cross-coupled pairs. The current-reuse pairs generate the negative 
 37
coefficient of 3.0 dB with 0.5 dB variation from 22.8 GHz to 28.9 GHz. The isolation 
is 19.2 dB at 24.0 GHz. The phase difference between coupled and through ports is kept 
from 90 to 95 degrees from 11.7 GHz to 26.1 GHz. The amplitude imbalance between 
the two output ports is less than 1.0 dB from 18.0 GHz to 35.0 GHz. Table 3 
summarizes the measured performances of the prototype. At 24 GHz, the prototype has 
dual transmission gains of 22.4 dB and 12.3 dB in the transmitting and receiving paths, 
respectively. The measured isolation, which is defined by the ratio of the forward 
transmission to reverse transmission coefficient in the same path, is higher than 50.0 dB 
at 24.0 GHz. By comparing the leakage phenomena between the prototype with and 
without feedforward cancellations, the leakage suppression can be improved with a 
maximum value of 44.7 dB at 23.63 GHz.
