1. Introduction  
Recently, microwave dielectric resonators have being widely used in communication system, 
such as cellular phones, wireless local area network (WLAN) and global positioning system (GPS) 
[1-3]. In particular, miniaturized GPS antennas have become more and more popular in the last few 
years. Materials with dielectric constant 90~100 can cut the antenna size to 12mm×12mm. However, 
further size reduction will require materials with a higher dielectric constant. it also possesses a 
much higher equivalent capacitance. In order to achieve appropriate capacitance, the antenna 
thickness is increased. The mentioned problem can be solved using dielectrics with k~50. Still, it 
suffers from its high dielectric loss. Low loss would then play a more prominent role instead. 
Requirements for the dielectric resonators (DR) must be combined with a high dielectric 
constant for possible size miniaturization, a low dielectric loss for a stable resonant frequency and a 
near-zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency( f ) for temperature stable circuits. When 
they are used in UHF and SHF band, they should be high dielectric constant material, since the 
guided-wavelength in the UHF and SHF band is rather long as compared to other higher frequency 
bend. So far, many high permittivity microwave dielectric materials, such as (Pb, Ba)O-Nd2O3-TiO2 
[4], (Pb, Ca)ZrO3 [5] and BaO-Sm2O3-TiO2 [6] has been developed.  
Generally, dielectric material of a high permittivity has a large positive temperature coefficient 
of resonant frequency [7]. With the combination of CaTiO3 [8] ( f ~ +800 ppm/C) and 
(Li1/2Sm1/2)TiO3 [9] ( f ~ –260 ppm/C), the CaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-TiO2 ceramics system exhibits good 
temperature stability. The non-stoichiometric compensation of CaO:Li2O:Sm2O3:TiO2=16:9:12:63

mA. The microstructures were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (ESEM; FEI Quanta 200 
Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, 
Philips XL-40FEG, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). The apparent densities of the sintered pellets were 
measured by the Archimedes method. The dielectric constant ( r ) and the quality factor values (Q) 
at microwave frequencies were measured using the Hakki-Coleman dielectric resonator method [10, 
11]. A system combining an HP8757D network analyzer and an HP8350B sweep oscillator was 
used in the measurement. For temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ), the technique is 
the same as that of quality factor measurement. The test cavity was placed over a thermostat in the 
temperature range of 25 to 80 C. The f  value (ppm/C) was calculated by noting the change in 
resonant frequency ( f )

3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Different replacement amount of SrO 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of (16-x)CaO-xSrO-Li2O-Sm2O3-Nd2O3-TiO2 ceramics system 
sintered at 1210 C for 3 h with different x values. The XRD patterns showed that peaks indicating 
the presence of (Ca, Sr)O-Li2O-(Sm, Nd)2O3-TiO2 phase. The main reflection lines are in agreement 
with the reflection line of CaTiO3, which is orthorhombic with a GdFeO3 perovskite structure [12]. 
Thus, it is understood that crystal structure of the main phase in the system is that the same as

system are listed in Table 2. When the substituted amount of BaO is 1 mol% (Sample No. 7), the 
dielectric properties：an r  of 124, fQ  value of 1,100 GHz (at 3.8 GHz) and f  value of 6 
ppm/C. This is because BaO-Sm2O3-4TiO2 possesses a dielectric constant r  ~ 81.8, a quality 
factor fQ  ~ 5,180 GHz and negative f  ~ -19.2 ppm/C [14], it is reasonable for the 
degradation of r , the improvement of the fQ  value and a negative shift of f  value in the 
modified system. 
The SEM micrographs of 
0.05CaO-0.1SrO-0.01BaO-0.09Li2O-0.1Sm2O3-0.02Nd2O3-0.63TiO2 (hereafter referred to as 
CSBLSNT) ceramics system sintered at different temperatures for 3 h are illustrated in Fig. 4. The 
CSBLSNT ceramics was not dense and the grain did not grow at 1120 C. As the sintering 
temperature increased, the grain size increased. The pores were almost eliminated for specimen 
sintered at 1180 C and the grain growth rapidly increased above 1210 C. However, the 
photograph of CSBLSNT ceramics showed that there co-existed two different grains in the 
specimen. One has a cuboid shape similar to that of CaO-SrO-Li2O-Sm2O3-Nd2O3-TiO2, while the 
other one has a bar shape similar to that of BaO-(Sm, Nd)2O3-4TiO2. The different grain might 
influence the microwave dielectric properties of the ceramics. 
Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used in combination with scanning electron 
microscopy to distinguish each grain for CSBLSNT ceramics sintered at 1180 C. As shown in Fig. 
5 and the EDX data of the CSBLSNT ceramics for spots A - E are listed in Table 3. Spot A - B 
revealed that the surface of CSBLSNT ceramics had Ca, Sr, Li, Sm, Nd, Ti and O ions, while Spot

Fig. 9 shows the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ) of the CSBLSNT 
ceramics at different sintering temperature for 3 h. The f  is known to be governed by the 
composition, the (Ca, Sr)O-Li2O-(Sm, Nd)2O3-TiO2 ceramics system and the second phase of 
materials. Since the f value of (Ca, Sr)O-Li2O-(Sm, Nd)2O3-TiO2 and BaO-(Sm, Nd)2O3-4TiO2 
are positive and negative, respectively. The CSBLSNT ceramics system can possess good 
temperature stability. A near-zero f  value of 6 ppm/C was obtained for CSBLSNT ceramics 
sintered at 1180 C for 3 h. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The microstructures and dielectric properties of 
(16-x-y)CaO-xSrO-yBaO-Li2O-Sm2O3-Nd2O3-TiO2 ceramics has been investigated. With partially 
substitution of SrO for CaO, the dielectric constant was significantly promoted and the f  value 
showed was positive. However, the substitution of BaO for CaO causes the presence of the second 
phase BaO-(Sm, Nd)2O3-4TiO2. The second phase possesses lower dielectric constant, high quality 
factor fQ  value and negative f  value. Thus, near-zero temperature coefficient of resonant 
frequency ( f ) can be expected by properly adjusting the (Ca, Sr)O/BaO ratio of CSBLSNT 
ceramics. A dielectric constant r  of 124, a high fQ  value of 1,100 GHz (measured at 3.8 
GHz) and a f value of 6 ppm/C can be obtained for 
0.05CaO-0.1SrO-0.01BaO-0.09Li2O-0.1Sm2O3-0.02Nd2O3 ceramics sintered at 1180 C for 3 h.
