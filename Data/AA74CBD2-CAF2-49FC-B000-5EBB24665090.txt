1 Introduction
Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) has been adopted in many communi-
cation systems, such as IEEE 802.16 [1] and long term evolution (LTE) [2], as a future multiple
access transmission scheme. The OFDMA system has the advantages of the multiuser diver-
sity, scalibity/adaptability in the selection of modulation coding scheme and low complexity
equalization. These advantages are based on the perfect synchronization of the system pa-
rameters between the users and the base station. The synchronization in an OFDMA system
consists of both the downlink and the uplink synchronization. The downlink synchronization is
quite similar to the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme
[12]. On the other hand, the uplink synchronization is a more challenging work [12]. It is
because at the uplink transmission, the received signal at the base station is a superposition
of the signals from different users. Different users may suffer different mismatch parameters
during the transmissions. These mismatch parameters include carrier frequency offset (CFO)
and timing offset etc. [12]. When the received signals from different users suffer different CFO
values, the received signal at the base station would be affected by not only the intercarrier
interferences but also the multiuser interferences. There have been many reports discussing
the issue of the uplink synchronization [3]-[12]. In this project, we study the CFO estimation
in the uplink OFDMA transmission using training sequences.
Some conventional OFDM synchronization techniques were applied to the uplink OFDMA
system [3][4]. The authors in [3] used the cyclic prefix (CP) to perform the CFO estima-
tion in the OFDMA uplink transmission. The subband subcarrier assignment was adopted
in [3] so that the multiuser interferences can be minimized. In [4], the author assumed that
the base station allows only one user to establish the uplink transmission while all the other
users are assumed to be perfectly synchronized. Then the conventional maximum likelihood
(ML) estimator of single user case for the CFO estimation can be applied. The ML estimator
for finding the multiple CFO values was studied in [5]. It was found [5] that the estimation
problem is nonlinear and involves a multidimensional numerical search to solve this problem.

with those assigned to the jth user if p ̸= j. The users then send their training symbols on
the correspondingly assigned subcarriers. After taking an M−point IDFT and adding a cyclic
prefix (CP) of length L, the users obtain their time-domain transmission symbols xp(n). Note
that after performing the downlink synchronization, it is reasonable to assume that at the base
station, the received signals from all users are located in the interference free region of the CP
[12][5]. Without much loss of generality, we assume the perfect timing synchronization in this
project. The channel from the pth user to the base station is modeled as an FIR filter hp(n) of
order Lp. Assuming the CP length L of the system satisfies L ≥ Lp, the interferences between
the OFDM transmission blocks can be avoided by removing the CP. Now suppose the users in
an OFDMA system may suffer different CFO values. Denote the normalized CFO for the pth
user as θp. It can be shown [5][12] the received signal at the base station is a superposition of
the signals from all users. To express the received signal in matrix form, we define an M ×M
diagonal matrix
Ep , diag
[
1 ej
2pi
M
θp · · · ej 2piM (M−1)θp
]
, (1)
an M × (Lp + 1) Toeplitz matrix Xp with the first row and first column respectively given by
[
xp(0) xp(M − 1) · · · xp(M − Lp)
]
(2)
and
[
xp(0) xp(1) · · · xp(M − 1)
]T
(3)
and an (Lp + 1)× 1 vector
hp ,
[
hp(0) hp(1) · · · hp(Lp)
]T
. (4)
Using these definitions, we can write the received vector as [12][5][9]
r =
P∑
p=1
EpXphp + q, (5)
where q is the blocked-version of the AWGN noise. From (5), we see that due to the CFO effect,
the orthogonality of the subcarriers is destroyed. That introduces not only the intercarrier
3
−0.5 < θp < 0.5 for all p. Using this assumption and the fact that the DFT size M is usually
large, we make an approximation to the CFO matrix Ep in (1) as
Ep ≈ ejpiθp
(
I− j 2pi
M
θpΓ
)
(9)
for p = 1, . . . , P , where Γ is an M ×M diagonal
Γ , diag
[
M
2 · · · 1 0 −1 · · · 1− M2
]
. (10)
Substituting the above approximation into (5), we can write
r ≈
P∑
p=1
ejpiθp
(
I− j 2pi
M
θpΓ
)
Xphp + q. (11)
From the above equation, we will show how to estimate the CFO θp without knowing the
channel response hp(n). To do this, we define an M × 2(LT + P ) matrix
B ,
[
X1 −j 2piMΓX1 · · · XP −j 2piMΓXP
]
, (12)
and a 2(LT + P )× 1 vector
v ,
[
vT1 v
T
2 · · · vTP
]T
, (13)
where the subvectors vp of v are 2(Lp + 1)× 1 vectors
vp ,
[
ejpiθphp
ejpiθpθphp
]
,
[
vp0
vp1
]
. (14)
Using the definitions in (12)-(14), we can express (11) as
r = Bv + q. (15)
From (15), we first obtain an estimate of the desired vector v. Suppose that M ≥ 2(LT + P )
and B has full column rank (proved in [15]). A least-squares estimate of v is given by
v̂ = (B†B)−1B†r. (16)
The desired subvector v̂p can be obtained from v̂ by taking the corresponding subvectors (using
(13)). Denote v̂p0 and v̂p1 as the first half and second half of v̂p respectively. From (14), an
estimate of the scaling factor θp is obtained by
θ̂p = Re
{
(v̂p0)
†v̂p1
‖v̂p0‖2
}
, (17)

significantly. Consider the computation of the vector v̂ in (16). Since the matrix B in (12)
consists of the circulant matrices Xp and the diagonal matrix Γ, computing B
†r and B†B are
in the order of O(M logM). The main cost is the computation of the matrix inverse (B†B)−1.
For the initial CFO estimate, the matrix B depends only on Xp and Γ. The matrix inverse
(B†B)−1 in the initial CFO estimate can be stored at the receiver. Hence the main cost is the
computation of (B†B)−1 for the CFO refinement. It’s because in this case the matrix B in (19)
depends on θ0p, for p = 1, . . . , P . It can be shown [13] that computing (B
†B)−1 is in general in
the order of O((2(LT + P ))3). Make a comparison with the alternating-projection frequency
estimator (APFE) in [5]. It is seen that the main cost of the APFE method has an order of
O(NcP ((P − 1)L)3) + O(L3NcPNw), where Nc and Nw denote the number of iterations and
the resolution of the CFO search respectively. Take the following as an example. Suppose
L = 4, P = 4, Nc = 3, Nw = 256 and LT = LP = 16 (Simulation results show that in this
case our proposed method provides a comparable performance with the APFE method). Our
method takes a total of 32768 complex multiplier operations while the APFE method takes a
total of 217344 complex multiplier operations.
4 Simulation Results
In this section, we carry out Monte-Carlo experiments for the performance evaluation. The
channel taps from the users to the base station are modeled as i.i.d complex Gaussian random
variables with zero-mean and the variances are normalized by
∑Lp
l=0 E
{|hp(l)|2} = 1 for all p.
The channel order is Lp = 3 for all p. The CP length is L = 4. The training symbols of each
user are QPSK symbols with the interleaved subcarrier assignment. The MSE of the CFO
estimate shown in the following experiments is obtained by taking the average of the MSEs
from all users’ CFO estimates. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power over the
noise power.
In the first experiment, we assume the number of the subcarriers is M = 256, and a
number of P = 4 and P = 6 users are considered. Each user is assigned with a number
of 64 and 42 subcarriers correspondingly. In Fig. 1, we first show the MSEs of the CFO

論文摘要 
In this paper, we study the estimation of multiple carrier frequency 
offsets (CFOs) in a uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access 
(OFDMA) system using training sequences. The proposed method can estimate 
the CFO values of all users in one OFDM block without knowing the channel 
responses. Unlike most earlier results, the proposed method does not 
involve any nonlinear search and thus has a much lower complexity. 
Simulation results show that our proposed method provides a comparable 
performance with the maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimator.
