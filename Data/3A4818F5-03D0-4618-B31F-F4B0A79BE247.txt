摘要 
 
本報告探討感知無線網路的頻譜管理問題。在此網路中，來自主要使用者
的『多次中斷』將大大地影響次要使用者的通訊效能。每當次要使用者被主要
使用者中斷時，次要使用者必須選擇一個適合的通道進行頻譜切換，以便繼續
未完成的傳輸。很明顯地，『多次中斷』將造成多次的頻譜切換，並且增加次
要使用者連線的傳輸延遲。為了從一個宏觀的角度來分析感知無線網路下『多
次中斷』行為對『次要使用者連線』所造成的傳輸延遲，本報告提出一個優先
權排隊理論的分析模型替感知無線網路的頻譜使用行為進行建模。藉由此模
型，我們分析次要使用者的一個重要服務品質參數：『完整系統時間』。 
在此報告中，基於排隊理論分析模型，我們發展具服務品質考量的頻譜管
理機制，其中包括 (1) 頻譜選擇機制、(2) 頻譜切換機制、和 (3) 頻譜分享
機制的設計與討論。針對這些機制的具體研究成果敘述如下：(1) 針對頻譜選
擇問題，我們提出一個具有負載平衡功效的頻譜選擇機制來優化次要使用者的
『完整系統時間』；(2) 針對頻譜切換問題，我們量化在多通道下多次頻譜切
換對次要使用者所造成的『完整系統時間』增加量；(3) 針對頻譜分享問題，
我們提出一個允入控制機制來避免主要使用者被次要使用者干擾並優化次要使
用者的『完整系統時間』。此外，我們也分析不同的媒介存取協定所造成的傳
輸延遲，並提出兩種媒介存取協定來改善網路效能。我們完整探討這三種頻譜
管理機制對次要使用者所造成的傳輸延遲。基於這些分析結果，在不同資料到
達率與服務時間分佈下，我們可以設計相對應的頻譜管理機制來增強次要使用

總而言之，本報告的主要貢獻是提出一個以排隊理論為基礎的分析模型並

可以提供一個很好的感知無線網路效能之分析架構。 
various MAC protocols is analyzed and two MAC protocols are proposed to
enhance the QoS performance of CR networks. From numerical results, we
can develop traffic-adaptive spectrum management policies to enhance the
QoS performance of the secondary users in CR networks with various traffic
arrival rates and service distributions.
To summarize, the main contribution of this report is to investigate the
modeling techniques for CR networks from a macroscopic viewpoint based
on the queueing theory. The proposed analytical framework can help ana-
lyze the performances of CR networks and provide important insights into
the design of various spectrum management techniques with enhanced QoS
performances.

spectrum handoffs for the secondary users, various spectrum management
techniques in CR networks are re-examined from a link connection quality
perspective. There are four spectrum management functionalities in CR
networks [12]:
1. Spectrum sensing: The secondary users should monitor all channels
in order to capture channel characteristic and detect spectrum holes.
Based on sensing results, the secondary users can find some candidate
channels to transmit data. In this report, we consider a fully-connected
CR network. Hence, the transmitter and receiver of a secondary con-
nection can have the same consensus on sensing results.
2. Spectrum decision: The secondary users can select the best channel
from many candidate channels to transmit data. This decision should
take the traffic statistics of the primary users as well as the secondary
users into account.
3. Spectrum mobility: The secondary users must vacate the occupied
channel when the primary user appears because the primary users
have the preemptive priority to access channels. In order to return
the occupied channel to the primary users and resume the unfinished
transmission at the suitable channel, the spectrum handoff procedures
are initiated for the interrupted secondary user.
4. Spectrum sharing: The secondary users must coordinate their trans-
missions and avoid interfering with transmission of the primary users.
Referring to [13], the relationships of these four spectrum management
functionalities are shown in Fig. 1.3. In the beginning, the traffic requests
of secondary users arrive at the CR network. With the spectrum decision

spectrum sharing issues. In order to evaluate the system performance of the
proposed spectrum management techniques, an analytical framework based
on the preemptive resumption priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing theory is de-
veloped to characterize the connection-based channel usage behaviors with
multiple handoffs. We investigate the effects of multiple handoffs on the
QoS performance and study the performance limitation of various spectrum
management techniques in different traffic loads. Different from the tradi-
tional work which investigated the effects of multiple handoffs on the network
throughput, this report concentrates on the effects of latency performance of
the secondary users. Based on the proposed analytical framework, some use-
ful insights into the design of the spectrum management techniques can be
provided and the traffic-adaptive spectrum management schemes can be de-
veloped according to traffic conditions such as traffic arrival rates and service
time distributions.
1.1 Problems and Solutions
In this section, we will briefly describe our problem formulations and the cor-
responding solutions, including modeling technique for CR networks, traffic-
adaptive spectrum mobility issues, load-balancing spectrum decision issues,
and interference-avoiding spectrum sharing issues.
1.1.1 Modeling Techniques for Cognitive Radio Net-
works
In this part, we outline the fundamental modeling issues of opportunistic
spectrum access in cognitive radio (CR) networks. In particular, we identify
6
channels and the optimal channel selection probability for the sensing-based
and the probability-based spectrum decision schemes, respectively. We find
that the probability-based scheme can yield a shorter overall system time
compared to the sensing-based scheme when the traffic loads of the sec-
ondary users is light, whereas the sensing-based scheme performs better in
the condition of heavy traffic loads. If the secondary users can intelligently
adopt the best spectrum decision scheme according to sensing time and traf-
fic parameters, the overall system time can be improved by 50% compared
to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed analytical model also
takes into account of the probability of missed detection and false alarm for
the appearance of the primary users, and can help evaluate the impacts of
imperfect sensing on the spectrum decision schemes for CR networks.
1.1.3 Proactive Spectrum Handoff
In this part, we present an analytical framework to evaluate the latency
performance of connection-based spectrum handoffs in cognitive radio (CR)
networks. During the transmission period of a secondary connection, multi-
ple interruptions from the primary users result in multiple spectrum handoffs
and the need of predetermining a set of target channels for spectrum hand-
offs. To quantify the effects of channel obsolete issue on the target channel
predetermination, we should consider the three key design features: (1) gen-
erally distributed service time of the primary and secondary connections; (2)
different operating channels in multiple handoffs; and (3) queueing delay due
to channel contention from multiple interrupted secondary connections. To
this end, we propose the preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queue-
ing network model to characterize the spectrum usage behaviors with all the
three design features. This model aims to analyze the extended data delivery
8
greedy algorithm can approach that of the optimal solution.
1.1.5 Reactive Spectrum Handoff
Spectrum handoff is an important functionality in cognitive radio (CR) net-
works. Whenever a primary user appears, transmission of the secondary users
must be interrupted. In this case, spectrum handoff procedures are initiated
for the secondary users in order to search the idle channel to resume the un-
finished transmission. Although this dynamic spectrum access scheme can
enhance channel utilization, multiple interruptions from the primary users
will result in multiple handoffs and thereby increase the transmission latency
of the secondary users. Hence, two fundamental issues in CR networks are
how much channel utilization can be improved and how long transmission
latency is extended for the secondary users due to multiple spectrum han-
odffs. To solve the first problem, we introduce the preemptive resume priority
(PRP) M/G/1 queueing network to characterize the channel usage behaviors
of CR networks. Based on this queueing network, channel utilization under
various traffic arrival rates and service time distributions can be evaluated.
Furthermore, on top of the proposed queueing network, a state diagram is
developed to characterize the effects of multiple handoff delay on the trans-
mission latency of the secondary users. The analytical results can provide a
helpful insight to study the effects of traffic arrival rates and service time on
the transmission latency and then facilitate the designs of admission control
rules for the secondary users subject to their latency requirements.
1.1.6 Interference-Avoiding Spectrum Sharing
In this part, we present an analytical framework to design key system param-
eters for an interference-avoiding admission control mechanism to enhance
10
one fundamental issue arises: how can the spectrum be dimensioned for con-
trol channels in order to minimize the access delay of MAC protocol in CR
networks? In this paper, we provide a comparative study in an analytical
manner on the latency performance of two MAC protocols: 1) dedicated con-
trol channel, and 2) embedded control channel approaches. Our results show
that an optimal ratio of the control channel bandwidth over the total chan-
nel bandwidth can be found to minimize the latency of MAC with dedicated
control channels. However, the delay performance of MAC with dedicated
control channels is more sensitive to the variations of the data lengths than
that of MAC with embedded control channels. Hence, we conclude that the
way of dimensioning the spectrum for control frames for MAC in CR net-
works should be adaptive to the variations of the traffic characteristics and
the number of users.
1.1.8 Location-Aware Concurrent Transmission for Spec-
trum Sharing
In traditional way, the spectrum sensing over a wide frequency range involves
the sophisticated time and energy-consuming signal processing [14]. Instead
of developing another efficient spectrum sensing technique, in this part, we
discuss a challenging but fundamental issue – Can CR devices effectively
identify the available spectrum holes without wideband spectrum sensing?
Intuitively, when the secondary CR users are far away from the primary
user of the legacy system, both CR and the primary users can concurrently
transmit their data without causing interference. If a CR device knows the
region where it can concurrently transmit with the primary user, the user
does not need to rely on the time- and energy-consuming wide-band spectrum
scanning to detect the spectrum holes. In addition, it is clear that concurrent
12
Can the CSMA/CA MAC protocol be directly adopted for the overlaying
ad hoc networks without changes? If not, how should the CSMA/CA MAC
protocol be modified to become an appropriate cognitive MAC protocol for
the overlaying ad hoc networks in the presence of primary users?
To this end, we propose a MAC protocol with QoS provisioning for over-
laying single-hop ad hoc networks on the legacy system, which is assumed to
adopt the time-division multiple access (TDMA) MAC protocol for packet
transmissions to guarantee QoS requirements, like GSM and WiMax. The
proposed MAC protocol coincides with the four stages of the cognition cy-
cle, as shown in Fig. 1.4 [17–19]. Corresponding to the cognition cycle, the
neighbor list establishment mechanism maps to the observe stage, which
can help a secondary user to recognize the spectrum usage around its neigh-
borhood. In the plan stage, the improved contention resolution mechanism
can enhance the overall performance in terms of throughput, access delay
and fairness. In the decide stage, the newly proposed reservation scheme
ensures the established ad hoc link with satisfactory QoS requirements. The
distributed frame synchronization mechanism then coordinates the transmis-
sions among stations in the act stage. With the helps of these QoS enhanced
techniques, an ad hoc network based on the proposed improved CSMA/CA
MAC protocol can coexist with a legacy TDMA system.
1.2 Report Outlines
This report consists of four themes as shown in Fig. 1.5. The first part is
to outlines the fundamental modeling issues of various spectrum manage-
ment techniques in CR networks. Then, an analytical framework based on
the preemptive resumption priority M/G/1 queueing theory is introduced to
14
characterize these modeling issues simultaneously. In order to demonstrate
the effectiveness of this model, three illustrative examples are presented in the
second. third, and fourth parts as follows. The second part investigates the
spectrum decision issue. We determine which channels to probe and trans-
mit in a load-balancing manner. The third part focuses on the spectrum
mobility issue. We illustrate how to model the effects of multiple handoffs,
where the secondary users can have different operating channels before and
after spectrum handoff. The final part considers the spectrum sharing issue.
The optimal admission probability for the secondary users is determined to
satisfy the interference constraint to the primary users. Furthermore, the
latency performance of various MAC protocols is analyzed and two MAC
protocols are proposed to enhanced the QoS performance of CR networks.
The remaining chapters of this report are organized as follows. In Chapter
2, we first give a literature survey of the state-of-the-art techniques. Chapter
3 provides an analytical framework to characterize the general channel usage
behaviors with multiple handoffs from a macroscopic viewpoint. Based on
the proposed analytical framework, Chapter 4 designs system parameters for
load-balancing multiuser spectrum decision schemes in CR networks. Fur-
thermore, Chapters 5 and 6 evaluate the latency performance and determine
the optimal target channel sequence for the proactive spectrum handoff, re-
spectively. Next, the effect of sensing time on the latency performance of
the reactive spectrum handoff is investigated in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8,
an admission control mechanism for the secondary users’ spectrum sharing
is discussed. Chapter 9 analyzes the latency performance of various MAC
protocols. Furthermore, two MAC protocols are proposed to enhanced the
QoS performance of CR networks in Chapters 10 and 11. Finally, the con-
cluding remarks and some suggestions for future research topics are given in
16
Chapter 2
Background and Literature
Survey
In this chapter, we firstly survey related work to the modeling techniques of
the connection-based channel usage behaviors with multiple handoffs. Then,
the existing spectrum management techniques, which consist of spectrum
decision, spectrum mobility, and spectrum sharing, also are discussed.
2.1 Modeling Techniques for Cognitive Radio
Networks
Most of the modeling techniques of channel usage behaviors in CR networks
can be classified into three categories: the partially observable Markov de-
cision process (POMDP), the two-dimensional Markov chain (TDMC), and
the PRP M/G/1 queueing model (QM). However, these models have not
simultaneously considered all of the five design features. Table 2.1 classifies
the existing modeling techniques, where the signs “ ◦ ” and “ × ” indicate
that the proposed model “does” and “does not” consider the corresponding
18
them to the case with generally distributed service time is not clear.
Some researchers used the PRP M/G/1 queueing model to character-
ize the spectrum usage behaviors of each channel. For example, the effects
of multi-user contention and multiple interruptions on the latency perfor-
mance of the secondary users’ connections were studied in [22–24]. This
PRP M/G/1 queueing model assumed that the secondary user must stay on
its current operating channel to resume its unfinished transmission when it
is interrupted. That is, there is one candidate channel for spectrum handofff
and thus the sensing time issue has not been addressed.
2.2 Load-Balancing Spectrum Decision
The load-balancing spectrum decision schemes can be categorized into two
methods: the sensing-based spectrum decision and the probability-based
spectrum decision. Table 2.2 compares the existing load-balancing spectrum
decision schemes. In the following, we discuss the features of these spectrum
decision methods in more details.
2.2.1 Probability-based Spectrum Decision
In the literature, many probability-based spectrum decision schemes were
proposed to balance the traffic loads of secondary users in multi-channel
CR networks, which can be categorized into three types: (1) packet-wise
probabilistic (PP) approach [25–29]; (2) game-theoretic (GT) approach [30–
32]; and (3) learning automata (LA) approach [33].
• Packet-wise probabilistic spectrum decision approaches [25–29] aim at
maximizing the expected throughput of the secondary users at each
slot by determining the probability of selecting each channel from the
20
pool of candidate channel. Based on busy probability and capacity
of each channel, [25] suggested a method to determine the probabil-
ity for selecting channels on top of p-persistent carrier sense multiple
access (CSMA) medium access control (MAC) protocol in a decentral-
ized manner. They claimed that their proposed sub-optimal channel
probability assignment can achieve the Nash equilibrium as the number
of secondary users tends to infinity. Furthermore, [26, 27] considered
the effects of sensing errors in terms of false alarm and missed detec-
tion on the throughput of the secondary users in a two-channel system,
and proposed a probabilistic channel selection approach to maximize
the throughput of the secondary users in each slot while maintaining
the latency constraint of the primary users. Moreover, [28] formulated
an optimization problem for channel selection probability to maximize
the throughput of the secondary users in each slot while maintaining
the interference constraint of the primary users when the primary and
secondary networks are asynchronous. Unlike [26–28] considered only
the case that one single secondary user can select the channel at each
time instant, [29] further extended the probabilistic channel selection
approach of [26, 27] to the case that multiple users can simultaneously
select their operating channels from the pool of candidate channels, and
analyzed the throughput of the secondary users based on the proba-
bilistic channel selection approach taking into account of the effects of
channel contention as well as sensing errors. Note that the packet-wise
probabilistic spectrum decision approaches in [25–29] were executed
in a slot-by-slot manner, which may lead to many channel-switching
behaviors during each secondary user’s link connection. Moreover, it
is assumed that the traffic loads of the secondary users are saturated.
22
• In [33], a learning automata (LA) approach was suggested to determine
the channel selection probabilities by exploring the uncertainty of traffic
patterns in CR networks. After a huge number of trials, the secondary
users can estimate the optimal channel selection probability. However,
the problem for this method is its converging speed, especially for a
large number of users.
2.2.2 Sensing-based Spectrum Decision
The sensing-based spectrum decision scheme requires scanning all the candi-
date channels to determine the most suitable operating channel. Thus, the
total number of candidate channels significantly affects the overall system
time in the sensing-based spectrum decision scheme. In [34–36], the opti-
mal number of candidate channels to maximize the spectrum accessibility
and the procedures to determine the optimal set of candidate channels were
investigated. Furthermore, the authors in [37, 38] formulated the sequential
channel sensing problem as an optimal stopping problem with the objective
of maximizing the throughput of the secondary users. They studied when
the secondary users shall stop sensing and start transmitting data. Never-
theless, the effects of multiple interruptions from the primary user and the
sensing errors for the primary user’s occurrence on the overall system time
of the secondary users in the CR networks have not been addressed in these
existing sensing-based spectrum decision methods.
2.3 Proactive Spectrum Handoff
In order to characterize the multiple handoff behaviors in CR networks, we
should consider the three key design features, consisting of (1) generally
24
Note that the Markov chain model is suitable for the exponentially dis-
tributed service time, and it is not clear how to extend it to the case
with generally distributed service time. In this model, the target chan-
nel selection problem in every time slot is modeled as a Markov decision
process. According to the channel occupancy state at the current time
slot, a decision maker (secondary user) can preselect the best action
(target channel) to maximize its immediate reward at the next time
slot such as expected per-slot throughput [35,40–43], expected idle pe-
riod [44], or expected waiting time [45]. Note that this model belongs
to the slot-based modeling technique because the secondary user shall
decide its target channel at each time slot. In this scheme, even though
the primary users do not appear at the current operating channel, the
secondary user may still need to change its target channel, resulting in
frequent spectrum handoffs.
• Arbitrary ON/OFF random process (OORP): Unlike [35,40–45]
assumed that the channel usage behaviors of the primary networks have
the Markov property, the authors in [46–48] used the ON/OFF random
process with arbitrary distributed ON/OFF period to characterize the
channel usage behaviors of the primary networks at each channel. It
was assumed that the secondary user can estimate the distributions of
the ON period and the OFF period based on long-term observations.
In each time slot, the secondary user must calculate the expected re-
maining idle periods of all channels and then will immediately switch
to the channel with the longest remaining idle period. This model
also belongs to the slot-based modeling technique because the target
channel is decided in each time slot.
26
To summarize, the first three analytical models, two-state Markov chain,
arbitrary ON/OFF random process, and bernoulli random process, did not
incorporate the effects of the traffic loads of the secondary users on the statis-
tics of channel occupancy. How to extend these models to consider the queue-
ing delay due to channel contention from multiple secondary connections is
unclear. The last two models, multi-dimensional Markov chain and M/G/1
queueing model, can characterize the effects of spectrum sharing between
multiple secondary users. However, these two models assumed that the in-
terrupted secondary user must stay on the current operating channel. and
have not dealt with the handoff interaction issue among different channels.
2.4 Optimal Proactive Spectrum Handoff
In the literature, some predetermined target channel selection methods for
spectrum handoffs have been proposed and can be categorized into two kinds:
probability-based channel selection methods and Markov decision process.
• In [26,27,29], the probability-based channel selection methods were de-
veloped to predetermine the probability that each channel is selected
to the target channel. Based on the predetermine probabilities, the
optimal channel hopping sequence can be decided in packet-by-packet
or slot-by-slot manners. The work in [26, 27] designed of the optimal
channel hopping sequence in the single-user case, while [29] extended
the similar problem to the multiple user case. The above approaches
for channel hopping sequence design are optimal in the sense of maxi-
mizing the per-slot throughput. However, the latency issue in spectrum
handoff has not been considered yet. Clearly, the cumulative delay in
one connection due to multiple spectrum handoffs is an important QoS

dimensional Markov chain; and (4) M/G/1 queueing model. One can observe
that the current modeling techniques have not considered all the aforemen-
tioned three design features. In the following, we briefly discuss the features
of these analytical models for spectrum handoff behaviors.
• ON/OFF random process (OORP): In [49, 56, 57], the ON/OFF
random process was used to characterize the channel usage behaviors
of the primary networks at each channel, where the distributions of ON
(busy) period- and OFF (idle) period at each channel are geometrical
distributed. The OFF state can be regarded as a potential spectrum
opportunity for the secondary users. The authors in [56] and [57] inves-
tigated the channel utilization factors and the extended data delivery
time of the secondary users, respectively. Unlike [57] that did not ad-
dress the effects of spectrum sensing time, the authors in [49] examined
the effects of spectrum sensing time on the extended data delivery time
of the secondary users. However, [49] assumed that at least one chan-
nel is certainly available after spectrum sensing, and the case that all
30
characterize the channel usage behaviors of a secondary network, where
each secondary user can simultaneously use all idle channels to transmit
its data. Because the total number of idle channels depends on how
many channels are occupied by the primary users, the service rates of
the secondary users are related to the traffic statistics of the primary
users, which results in a non-trivially distributed service time. Thus,
the authors suggested using the M/G/1 queueing system to characterize
this system. However, authors did not show how to obtain this non-
trivial service time distribution.
2.6 Interference-Avoiding Spectrum Sharing
In order to determine the optimal admission probability, we should con-
sider four key design features: (1) interference on the primary users (PUs),
where the transmission of the primary users may be stained by the secondary
users due to missed detection; (2) channel contention between multiple sec-
ondary users (SUs), where channel contention will increase waiting time of
the secondary users; (3) multiple handoffs, a secondary user may have mul-
tiple handoffs due to multiple interruptions from the primary users during
its transmission period; and (4) generally distributed service time, where the
probability mass functions (pmfs) of service time of the primary and sec-
ondary connections can be any distributions. Based on these four design
features, Table 2.5 classifies the existing admission control techniques.
2.6.1 Admission Control with Perfect Sensing
• Network-throughput-oriented approach: The authors in [6,25,50]
determined the optimal admission probability to maximize the overall
32
• User-throughput-oriented approach: [55] determined the optimal
payload length of the secondary users to maximize the throughput of
each secondary user. They assumed that the interrupted secondary
users must retransmit whole data connection instead of resume the un-
finished transmission. They found that the longer payload length can
increase per-secondary-user throughput when header length is a con-
stant, but it also increase the interrupted probability, thereby degrad-
ing per-secondary-user throughput. Then, a preemptive repeat priority
queueing model was proposed to solve this tradeoff issue.
• Dropping-probability-oriented approach: In [63], the optimal ar-
rival rate (admission probability) is determined to minimize the drop-
ping (or forced termination) probability of the secondary users by for-
mulating it as a nonlinear optimization problem with the constraint
of given the blocking probability for the secondary users. In order to
derive the closed-form expressions for the dropping and blocking proba-
bilities in terms of arrival rate, a two-dimensional Markov chain is used
to characterize the channel usage behaviors of a CR network, where
the two dimensions represent the total numbers of the primary and
the secondary users, respectively. Note that this Markov chain model
is suitable for the exponentially distributed service time, and how to
extend it to the case with generally distributed service time it is not
clear.
• Latency-oriented approach: In [70], authors proposed a Markov
chain model to characterize channel usage behavior of both the primary
users and the secondary users. Based on this model, the transmission
latency of the secondary users under various arrival rates of the primary

2.7 Latency Analysis for Spectrum Sharing
We summarize some current multi-channel MAC protocols. Then, we discuss
their operation process and drawbacks.
2.7.1 Dedicated Control Channels Method
The typical operation process for the multi-channel MAC protocols with ded-
icated control channels [76–81] is shown as Fig.2.1. All nodes have assigned a
common (or some) dedicated control channel(s) beforehand. Thus, all nodes
can exchange the spectrum usage situation and control packets (request-to-
send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS)) on common spectrums. Then, after
exchanging some control messages, transmitter and receiver can know which
channel is the desired data channel and can communicate on it.
Assigning a dedicated common control channel can give each node a com-
mon communication platform and decrease the complexity of spectrum ac-
cess. However, this operation process may cause the control channel satura-
tion problem (we will discuss in next section) and increase the access latency.
Furthermore, this operation process is suitable for CR environment. Thus,
this operation can be considered when design a CR MAC protocol.

2.7.3 Common Hopping Sequence Method
Another kind of multi-channel MAC protocol is shown in [87–89]. The basic
idea for this method is to use a common hopping sequences to do channel
switch as shown in Fig.2.3. Each node uses a hopping sequence to do channel
hopping and can communicate with another node once switch to the same
frequency band.
This operation process can ignore the control channel saturation problem.
However, this method needs all nodes to be tightly synchronized. Further-
more, it needs to have a schedule beforehand and is not suitable for the
time-varying CR networks.
2.7.4 Embedded Control Channels Method
We introduce a CR MAC with the embedded control channels in Fig.2.4.
There are two candidate data channels CH 1, CH 2 in this system and CH 2
has the largest idle period.
1. At T1 - In the beginning of the procedure, SU 2 doesn’t have data to
transmit and its default channel CH 3 is busy. Thus, SU 2 switches
to the idle channel CH 1 even though the CH 2 has the longest idle
period.
38
2.7.5 Summary
Basically, the design of control channels in multi-channel networks can be cat-
egorized into four kinds as shown in Figure 2.5: (I) common control frequency,
non common control period (ex: dedicated control channel [76, 90–92]); (II)
non common control frequency, common control period (ex: dedicated con-
trol period [82, 93, 94]); (III) common control frequency, common control
period. (ex: common hopping sequence [87, 95]); (IV) non common control
frequency, non common control period. (ex: embedded control channel). Be-
cause we focus on CR networks, Types II, III are not discussed in this thesis.
Thus, we only focus on Type I (called the dedicated control channel) and
Type IV (called the embedded control channel) in this thesis.
2.8 Concurrent Transmission for Spectrum Shar-
ing
In general, the goal of concurrent transmission can be achieved by the physical-
layer or the MAC-layer techniques [96]. From the aspect of physical layer,
the power control mechanism has been used to avoid interference between the
concurrent transmission links [8,97–100]. In addition, [24,101,102] tuned the
physical carrier sensing threshold to increase the opportunity of spatial reuse.
Next, the rate adaptation approach has been proposed to improve the sig-
nal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) of communication links [103,104].
Thus, more links can concurrently transmit. Furthermore, the multiple-
input and multiple-output (MIMO) and the directional antenna techniques
have been used to cancel interference from other active links [105] and avoid
interference to other active links [106], respectively.
40
2.9 Cognitive MAC Protocol for Spectrum
Sharing
The carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) MAC
protocol is a well known MAC protocol for resolving the contention issue
in many existing wireless networks, such as the IEEE 802.11 wireless local
area network (WLAN) [16]. Since the CSMA/CA MAC protocol requests a
station to sense the channel usage before transmissions, this kind of MAC
protocol has potential and is natural to become a strong candidate for the
CR networks. Thus, we are motivated to ask two natural and fundamental
questions: Can the CSMA/CA MAC protocol be directly adopted for CR
networks without changes? If not, how should the CSMA/CA MAC protocol
be modified to become an appropriate cognitive MAC protocol?
To answer the above questions, we examine the CSMA/CA MAC pro-
tocol in the four stages of the cognition cycle one by one. First, from the
viewpoint of the observe stage, the cognitive MAC protocol is required to
record the spectrum usage time of the primary users and to collect the traffic
characteristics, such as the delay-sensitive or non-real-time data traffic. For
the CSMA/CAMAC protocol, most research results currently focus on either
sensing the carrier transmission in the surrounding environment or avoiding
interference [16, 107–109], instead of identifying the interference. Thus, the
functions of recording the spectrum usage and traffic characteristics are not
fully considered in the current CSMA/CA MAC protocols.
Second, in the plan stage of the cognition cycle, the cognitive MAC pro-
tocol shall determine whether the requested frame transmission from a CR
device will interfere the primary user’s connection. Because the cognitive
MAC protocol will only permit a CR device to utilize the spectrum of the
42
specific functions in the four stages of the cognition cycle . In this paper,
we propose such a cognitive MAC protocol with QoS provisioning for the
CR networks. The proposed MAC protocol is extended from our previous
works [124,125] and coincides with the four stages of the cognition cycle. The
neighbor list establishment mechanism maps to the observe stage, which can
help a CR user recognize the channel usage around its neighborhood. Corre-
sponding to the plan stage, the improved contention resolution mechanism
can enhance the overall performance in terms of throughput, access delay and
fairness over the legacy CSMA/CA MAC protocol. In the decide stage, the
newly proposed reservation scheme ensures the established ad hoc link with
satisfactory QoS requirements. The novel distributed frame synchronization
mechanism coordinates the transmissions among stations in the act stage.
In the following sections, we detail our proposed cognitive MAC protocol.
44
latency-sensitive traffic for the secondary users.
In this chapter, in order to evaluate the QoS performances of spectrum
management techniques in the non-hopping or the hopping modes, an analyt-
ical framework based on the preemptive resumption priority (PRP) M/G/1
queueing theory is developed. The proposed analytical framework can pro-
vide important insights into the system parameter design of spectrum man-
agement techniques and can be adapted more flexibly for various traffic ar-
rival rates and service time distributions. Finally, we also provide some new
research directions and open issues on top of this model.
3.1 Motivation
Although it is conceptually simple, the proposed PRP M/G/1 queueing net-
work model faces the new challenges. Specifically, it is needed to consider the
general behaviors of the connection-based channel usage, including the fol-
lowing key design features: (1) multiple interruptions and handoffs; (2) spec-
trum sensing time; (3) various operating channels, the operating channels
before and after spectrum handoff can be different; (4) generally distributed
service time, where the probability mass functions (pmfs) of service time of
the primary and the secondary connections can be any distributions; and (5)
channel waiting time due to multiple secondary connections’ contention.
How to find a unifying analytical model to characterize the effects of the
five key design features is important. Because there are many approaches
for target channel selection in the hopping model, it is challenging to find a
unifying model to facilitate the QoS performance evaluation for various spec-

3.3 Queueing Theoretical Framework for Spec-
trum Management
3.3.1 Assumptions
Assume that the considered CR network is a time-slotted system as [40,128–
131]. In order to detect the presence of primary users, each secondary user
must perform spectrum sensing at the beginning of each time slot. If the
current operating channel is idle, the secondary user can transmit one slot-
sized frame in this time slot. Otherwise, the secondary user must perform
spectrum handoff procedures to resume its unfinished transmission at the
preselected target channel. This kind of listen-before-talk channel access
scheme is implemented in many wireless techniques, such as the quiet period
of the IEEE 802.22 standard [132] and the clear channel assessment (CCA)
of the IEEE 802.11 standard [133].
3.3.2 Overview of the PRP M/G/1 Queueing Network
Model
Now we propose a preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing net-
work model to characterize the connection-based spectrum usage behaviors
in CR networks. This queueing network analytical framework is quite general
and can be easily adjusted to evaluate the performance of various spectrum
management techniques under different traffic conditions. Furthermore, it
can also be applied to general CR network architectures, including ad hoc

• The arrival processes of the primary and the secondary connections are
Poisson.
• Only one user can transmit on each channel at any time instant.
• The secondary transmitter can notifies its corresponding receiver of the
interruption event by certain spectrum handoff protocols [136].
Figure 3.2 shows an example of the PRP M/G/1 queueing network model
with three channels. Let λs (arrivals/slot) be the arrival rates of the sec-
ondary connections in CR network. When a secondary connection arrives

channel according to the predetermined probability or the outcomes from in-
stantaneous spectrum sensing. If the spectrum sensing is executed to search
the idle channels, S can be regarded as a tapped delay line or a server
with constant service time, which related to sensing time. Hence, the ef-
fect of spectrum sensing time on the latency performance of the secondary
connections can be characterized.
3.3.3 Modeling of the Connection-based Channel Us-
age Behaviors
Now, we explain why the proposed model can characterize the connection-
based channel usage behaviors in a CR network. In order to accurately
characterize the transmission processes of a secondary connection, we must
take the seven events as discussed in Section 3.2 into account.
1. Secondary connection arrival event as shown in Fig. 3.1(a): We assume
that the arrival process of the secondary connections is Poisson. Let
Xs be the service time of the secondary connections and fs(x) be the
probability mass function (pmf) of Xs.
2. Initial channel selection event of the secondary connections as shown
in Fig. 3.1(b): We use p(k) to represent the probability that the sec-
ondary connection selects channel k for its initial operating channel.
Furthermore, if the spectrum sensing is executed to decide the initial
operating channel, the effect of sensing time can be modeled by S .
3. Primary connection arrival event as shown in Fig. 3.1(c): We assume
that the arrival process of the primary connections is Poisson. Denote
λ
(k)
p as the arrival rate of the primary connections whose default chan-
nels are channel k. Furthermore, let X
(k)
p be the service time of the
54
tions where i ≥ 0. At channel k, denote ω(k)i as the arrival rate of traffic
flows redirected from the type-(i − 1) secondary connections. That is, ω(k)i
is the arrival rate of the type-i secondary connections at channel k. Note
that ω
(k)
0 = λ
(k)
s . Furthermore, let Φ
(k)
i be the transmission duration of a sec-
ondary connection between the ith and the (i+ 1)th interruptions at channel
k and f
(k)
i (φ) be the pmf of Φ
(k)
i . That is, Φ
(k)
i is the effective service time of
the type-i secondary connections at channel k.
Figure 3.3 illustrates the physical meaning of random variable Φ
(k)
i . Recall
that Xs is the service time of the secondary connections. We generate Xs five
times in Fig. 3.3. The five realizations are divided into many segments due
to multiple primary users’ interruptions. For example, the first secondary
connection (realization) is divided into four segments because it experiences
three interruptions in total. The first, second, third, and fourth segments
are transmitted at channels 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively. Thus, this secondary
connection’s initial operating channel is Ch1 and its target channel sequence
is (Ch1,Ch1,Ch2). In Fig. 3.3, random variable Φ
(1)
2 is one of the gray
regions, representing the transmission duration of a secondary connection
between the 2nd and the 3rd interruptions at Ch1. That is, Φ
(1)
2 is one of the
third segments of the first, the third, and the fourth secondary connections
in Fig. 3.3. Note that the fifth secondary connection in Fig. 3.3 does not
have the third segment because it is interrupted only once.
In the hopping mode, it is quite complex to find the probability mass
function of the effective service time of each segment because the effective
service time is dependent on the traffic statistics of the primary and other sec-
ondary users of each channels and the operating channels for these segments
can be different. Fortunately, based on the proposed analytical framework,
we provide a systematic approach to study the effects of various system pa-

we can design the suitable parameters to shorten the overall system time.
Unlike the non-load-balancing methods that multiple secondary users may
contend for the same channel, the channel selection schemes based on the
designed parameters of the proposed analytical model can evenly distribute
the traffic loads of secondary users to multiple channels, thereby reducing
the average overall system time. The major contributions of this chapter are
summarized in the following:
• Derive the optimal selection probability for the probability-based chan-
nel selection scheme.
• Develop a method to determine the optimal number of candidate chan-
nels for the sensing-based channel selection scheme.
• Compare the sensing-based and the probability-based channel selection
methods and suggest which spectrum decision scheme can result in
shorter overall system time with various sensing error probabilities and
traffic parameters.
• Characterize the effects of sensing errors on the spectrum decision
schemes of CR networks in terms of the overall system time of the
primary and the secondary connections.
4.1 Motivation
The overall system time of the secondary users’ connections is affected by
the multiple interruptions from the primary users and the sensing errors like
missed detection and false alarm for the primary users. Within the transmis-
sion period of the secondary users’ connection, it is likely to have multiple
spectrum handoffs due to the interruptions from the primary users. Clearly,
60
ber of candidate channels to minimize the overall system time. On the other
hand, the probability-based spectrum decision scheme needs to prevent the
secondary users from selecting a busy channel. Hence, the most important
issue is to determine the optimal channel selection probability to minimize
the overall system time.
4.2 System Model
4.2.1 Assumptions
In practice, many reasons may lead to an error on sensing the presence of
the primary users. If such an sensing error occurs, not only the primary
user’s connection will be stained, but the secondary user’s transmission will
be affected. There are two types of sensing errors regarding the detection
of the primary users: false alarm and missed detection. False alarm occurs
when the detector reports the presence of a primary user while it is absent,
while missed detection occurs when the detector reports the absence of a
primary user while it is present. In this chapter, the effects of false alarm
and missed detection on CR network performance are discussed in Section
4.5.
4.2.2 Spectrum Decision Behavior Model
Fig. 4.1 illustrates the spectrum decision behavior model, which will be used
to evaluate the overall system time of a secondary user’s connection for dif-
ferent channel selection schemes. We assume that the arrival processes of the
primary and the secondary connections1 are Poisson. Let λ

connection at channel k is λ
(k)
s = p(k)λs. Note that various channel selection
algorithms yield different distribution probability vectors.
4.3 Problem Formulation
4.3.1 Performance Metric: Overall System Time
The overall system time (denoted by S) is an important quality of service
(QoS) metric for the connection-based service of the secondary users. It
consists of the waiting time (denoted by W ) and the extended data delivery
time (denoted by T ) as shown in Fig. 4.2. Hence, we have
E[S] = E[W ] + E[T ] , (4.1)
where E[·] is the expectation function. Here, the waiting time is defined as
the duration from the instant that a data transmission request arrives at
the system until the instant of starting transmitting data. The duration of
waiting time depends on the channel selection scheme that the secondary
users adopt. Furthermore, the extended data delivery time is defined as
the duration from the beginning of transmitting the data in the first time
slot until the completion of the data in the last time slot. Clearly, multiple
handoff behaviors significantly affect the extended data delivery time.
4.3.2 Overall System Time Minimization Problem for
Probability-based Channel Selection Scheme
For the probability-based channel selection method, each secondary user se-
lects its operating channel from all the M candidate channels based on a
64
predetermined distribution probability vector ppb. In this case, an Overall
System Time Minimization Problem for Probability-based Channel
Selection Scheme can be formulated as follows. Given the set of candidate
channels Ω = {1, 2, . . . ,M}, we aim to find the optimal distribution proba-
bility vector (denoted by p∗) to minimize the average overall system time of
the secondary connections (denoted by E[Spb]). Formally,

where ρ(k) is the busy probability of channel k. Furthermore, ρ

are the busy probabilities resulting from the primary and the secondary con-
nections at channel k when sensing errors are considered, respectively. In
Section 4.4, we will derive the closed-form expressions for ρ

(k)

4.3.3 Overall System Time Minimization Problem for
Sensing-based Channel Selection Scheme
For the sensing-based channel selection scheme, the secondary users perform
wideband sensing to find an idle channel from all the candidate channels. If
more than one idle channel is found, the secondary user randomly selects one
channel from the idle channels for its operating channel. Furthermore, if all
the candidate channels are busy, the secondary user still randomly select one

line S . In this case, S can be regarded as a server with constant service
time, which equals to sensing time. If an idle channel can be found, the
secondary connection can be served immediately. Finally, in Figs. 4.3 and
4.4, the channel usage behaviors of each channel is characterized by a PRP
M/G/1 queueing model, which had been presented in Chapter 3. Here, we
assume that the non-hopping mode is adopted. Hence, the secondary user
must stay on its current channel when it is interrupted.
Based on the proposed performance models, we can analytically compare
the overall system time resulting from both the spectrum decision schemes for
various sensing time and traffic parameters. Then, each secondary user can
intelligently adopt the best channel selection scheme to minimize its overall
68
system time. Thus, the optimal overall system time (denoted by S∗) can be
expressed as follows:
S∗ = min (E[Spb],E[Ssb]) . (4.7)
In the next section, we will show how to derive E[Spb] and E[Ssb].
4.4 Analysis of Overall System Time
As discussed in Section 4.3.1, the overall system time consists of the waiting
time and the extended data delivery time. Let E[Tpb] and E[Tsb] be the
average data delivery time for the probability- and sensing-based spectrum
decision methods, respectively. Furthermore, denote E[Wpb] and E[Wsb] as
the average waiting time for the probability- and sensing-based spectrum
decision methods, respectively. Then, we can have
E[Spb] = E[Wpb] + E[Tpb] , (4.8)
and
E[Ssb] = E[Wsb] + E[Tsb] . (4.9)
In the following, we will investigate how to obtain the average extended data
delivery time and the average waiting time.
4.4.1 Extended Data Delivery Time
First, we investigate the effects of multiple interruptions on the extended data
delivery time. Within the transmission period of a secondary connection, it
is likely to have multiple spectrum handoffs due to the interruptions from the
primary users. The spectrum handoff procedure helps the secondary users
vacate the occupied channel and then resume the unfinished transmission

according to to [141]. Note that E[X˜s]
and E[X˜

Finally, the average extended data delivery time for the probability- and
sensing-based channel selection methods can be expressed as follows:
E[Tpb] =

(k)] , (4.11)
and
E[Tsb] =
n∑
k=1
p
(k)
sb E[T
(k)] . (4.12)
For various channel selection algorithms, we use different methods to eval-
uate the corresponding distribution probability vectors p. For the probability-
based scheme, the distribution probability vector ppb can be designed by solv-
ing theOverall System Time Minimization Problem for Probability-
based Channel Selection Scheme in (4.2). For the sensing-based scheme,
the distribution probability vector psb is determined inherently based on the
given traffic patterns. Intuitively, a channel with larger idle probability will
be selected more frequently through spectrum sensing. How to derive psb
from the given traffic parameters will be discussed in Appendix A.
4.4.2 Waiting Time
Next, we focus on the derivations of the average waiting time for the probability-
based and sensing-based channel selection schemes.
Probability-based Channel Selection Scheme
For the probability-based channel selection scheme, a secondary connection
selects its operating channel based on the predetermined probability. Then,
it is directly connected to the low-priority queue of the selected channel. It

the Overall System Time Minimization Problem for Probability-
based Channel Selection in (4.2).
Sensing-based Channel Selection Scheme
The waiting timeWsb for the sensing-based channel selection method consists
of the total sensing time and the queueing time (denoted by W ′sb). Let τ
be the sensing time for scanning one candidate channel. Hence, nτ is the
total sensing time for scanning all the n candidate channels. After wideband
sensing, the secondary user can decide channel availability and then transmits
data at one of the idle channels. Moreover, if the idle channel cannot be
found, the secondary user cannot transmit immediately. In this case, the
secondary user’s connection will be put into the low-priority queue of the
randomly selected channel. Hence, we can have
E[Wsb] = nτ +Pr(E)× 0 +Pr(Ec)× E[W ′sb] , (4.16)
where E is the event that at least one idle channel can be found after sensing,
and Ec is the compliment of E .
Next, the closed-form expressions for Pr(E) and Pr(Ec) can be derived
by the following two observations. First, a channel is called actual idle if
and only if (1) this channel is not occupied by the primary connections and
(2) the low-priority queue of this channel is empty. Note that the second
condition should be contained because the FCFS scheduling discipline is
adopted. Secondly, an actual idle channel is assessed as idle through spectrum
sensing if and only if false alarm does not occur. Hence, we can have
Pr(E) =
n∑
k=1

vestigates the effects of false alarm and missed detection on the transmission
time of the secondary and the primary connections. Specifically, we will show
how to derive the first and the second moments of X˜s and X˜
(k)
p .
4.5.1 False Alarm
First, we study the effect of false alarm on the actual service time of the
secondary connections. When a false alarm occurs, a secondary user cannot
transmit data even with an idle channel. Hence, the actual service time
of a secondary connection will be extended to X˜s (slots/arrival) from Xs
(slots/arrival). The first and the second moments of X˜s can be expressed as
follows:
E[X˜s] =
∞∑
x=1
E[X˜s|Xs = x]Pr(Xs = x) , (4.20)
and
E[(X˜s)
2] =
∞∑
x=1
E[(X˜s)
2|Xs = x]Pr(Xs = x) . (4.21)
Note that because the false-alarm slot cannot be exploited by any secondary
or primary connections, it can be regarded as a busy slot. Hence, we can
have ρ
(k)
s = λ
(k)
s E[X˜s].
When a false alarm occurs, the data transmission is postponed to the
next slot. Hence, for a connection with x slots, its actual service time will be
extended to x + i slots if and only if false alarms occur in i slots out of the
first x+ i− 1 slots and false alarms do not occur at the (x+ i)th slot. Thus,
the conditional expectation of the actual service time follows the negative
binomial distribution with parameter PF . That is,
E[X˜s|Xs = x] =

its first sensing phase. We call this situation the class-A missed detection.
After a secondary user arrives at a CR network for a while, it may also fail to
detect the presence of primary users. In this case, the class-B missed detec-
tion occurs. The authors in [64,66] found that the class-B missed detection is
small because the sensing results at the first sensing phase can be employed
to improve the accuracy of the sensing results at the following sensing phases.
Next, we explain the effect of class-A missed detection on the actual ser-
vice time of the primary connection at channel k. We consider a transmission
slot of this primary connection. During this slot, more than one arrival of
the secondary connection appears with probability 1 − e−λ(k)∆s , where ∆ is
the slot duration. For these arrivals of secondary connections, each of them
will assess this busy slot as idle if and only if (1) a missed detection oc-
curs and (2) the low-priority queue of channel k is empty. Let Q
(k)
s be the
length of the low-priority queue at channel k. Hence, the first arrival at
the considered slot will make an error channel assessment with probability
PMPr{Q(k)s = 0}, where PM is the missed detection probability for spectrum
sensing and Pr{Q(k)s = 0} has been derived in [144]. However, for the re-
maining arrivals in the considered slot, we have Pr{Q(k)s = 0} = 0 because
the first arrival has been put into the low-priority queue of channel k. Thus,
the remaining arrivals do not make the error channel assessment. From above
observations, we can conclude that a primary connection’s transmission slot
is stained by the arrivals of the secondary connections with probability
P
(k)
I = (1− e−λ
(k)∆
s )PMPr{Q(k)s = 0} . (4.29)
Similar to the case of missed detection, we find that the random variables
X˜
(k)
p and (X˜
(k)
p )2 follows the negative binomial distribution with parameter
P
(k)
I when X
(k)
p = x. Then, because Pr(X
(k)
p = x) can be determined by
f
(k)
p (l), we can calculate the values of E[X˜
(k)
p ] and E[(X˜
(k)
p )2] in (4.27) and
78
probability vector is plotted in each bar and the summation of all proba-
bilities in each bar is 1. In the figure, we consider a four-channel system
with the following traffic parameters: λ
(1)
p = 0.01, λ
(2)
p = 0.01, λ
(3)
p = 0.02,

(2)
p ] = 30, E[X
(3)
p ] = 20, and
E[X
(4)
p ] = 25. When λs = 0.01, all the secondary users prefer selecting chan-
nel 1 to be their operating channels because channel 1 has the lightest traffic
loads. Furthermore, as λs increases, some secondary users tend to select
other channels to transmit data in order to balance the traffic loads in each
channel. For example, when λs = 0.1, the optimal distribution probability
vector is (0.4142, 0.2784, 0.2131, 0.0943). Inevitably, channel 1 is still selected
to be the operating channel with the largest probability.
Furthermore, Fig. 4.6 shows the channel busy probability under various
arrival rates of the secondary connections. In the beginning, channel 1 has the
lowest busy probability. However, when λs ≥ 0.05, channel 1 has the highest
busy probability because most secondary users prefer to select channel 1 to
transmit data. Although channel 1 has the highest busy probability in this
case, one can find that the secondary users still favor channel 1 from the
viewpoint of the overall system time. The performance advantages of the
choosing the probability vector based on the proposed analytical framework
over the traditional channel selection methods will be illustrated in Fig. 4.11
from the perspective of the overall system time.
Figure 4.7 shows that most secondary connections prefer selecting a chan-
nel with the largest arrival rate and the shortest service time of the primary
connections even though all the channels have the same busy probability of
the primary connections. Here, we consider the following traffic parameters:
λ
(1)
p = 0.01, λ

p = 0.02, λ

p = 0.04, and λ

4.6.3 Comparison between Different Spectrum Deci-
sion Schemes
Figure 4.11 shows the effects of λs on the average overall system time for
three different channel selection schemes: (1) sensing-based method; (2)
probability-based method; and (3) non-load-balancing method. Consider a
three-channel system with the following traffic parameters: (λ
(1)
p , λ
(2)
p , λ
(3)
p ) =
(0.02, 0.02, 0.03), (E[X
(1)
p ],E[X
(2)
p ],E[X
(3)
p ]) = (20, 25, 20), and E[Xs] = 10.
The overall system time of the probability-based and sensing-based channel
selection schemes are calculated from (4.8) and (4.9), respectively. For the
non-load-balancing method, all the secondary connections will select chan-
nel 1 to be their operating channels because channel 1 has the lowest busy
probability. One can find that both the load-balancing channel selection
schemes can significantly reduce the average overall system time compared
to the non-load-balancing scheme, especially for larger λs. When τ is small
(e.g. 5 slots), the sensing-based spectrum decision scheme can result in the
shortest overall system time. As τ increases, the improvement of the sensing-
based spectrum decision over other schemes decreases. In addition, we also
observe that when τ = 17 and λs < 0.026, the probability-based scheme
has better overall system time performance than the sensing-based scheme.
This is because the probability-based spectrum decision scheme can select
the channels with lower interrupted probability. By contrast, if λs > 0.026,
the sensing-based scheme can result in shorter overall system time because
the sensing-based scheme can significantly reduce waiting time through wide-
band sensing. Based on (4.7), each secondary user can intelligently adopt the
best channel selection scheme to minimize its overall system time. The two
considered load-balancing spectrum decision methods can reduce the over-
all system time by over 50% compared to the existing non-load-balancing
88
Chapter 5
Proactive Spectrum Handoff
Spectrum handoff mechanisms can be generally categorized into two kinds
according to the decision timing of selecting target channels [141]. The first
kind is called the proactive spectrum handoff1, which decides the target chan-
nels for future spectrum handoffs based on the long-term traffic statistics be-
fore data connection is established [128, 146, 147]. The second kind is called
the reactive spectrum handoff scheme [148]. For this scheme, the target
channel is searched in an on-demand manner [149, 150]. After a spectrum
handoff is requested, spectrum sensing is performed to help the secondary
users find idle channels to resume their unfinished data transmission. Both
spectrum handoff schemes have their own advantages and disadvantages. A
quantitative comparison of the two spectrum handoff schemes was provided
in [151].
1In this report, we assume that spectrum handoff request is initiated only when the
primary user appears as discussed in the IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks
(WRAN) standard. In this scheme, the proactive spectrum handoff represents the spec-
trum handoff scheme with the proactively designed target channel sequences. It is different
from the proactive spectrum handoff in [35,40–48] that assumes spectrum handoff can be
performed before the appearance of the primary users.
90
5.1 Motivation
To characterize the channel obsolescence effects and the spectrum usage be-
haviors with a series of interruptions in the secondary connections, we suggest
a new performance metric - the extended data delivery time of the secondary
connections. It is defined as the duration from the instant of starting trans-
mitting data until the instant of finishing the whole connection, during which
multiple interruptions from the primary users may occur. In the context of
the connection-based spectrum handoffs, how to analyze the extended data
delivery time is challenging because three key design features must be taken
into account: (1) generally distributed service time, where the probability
density functions (pdfs) of service time of the primary and secondary con-
nections can be any distributions; (2) different operating channels before and
after spectrum handoff; and (3) queueing delay due to channel contention
from multiple secondary connections. To the best of our knowledge, an ana-
lytical model for characterizing all these three features for multiple handoffs
has rarely been seen in the literature.
5.2 System Model
5.2.1 Assumptions
In this chapter, we make the following assumptions:
• A default channel is preassigned to each secondary user through spec-
trum decision algorithms in order to balance the overall traffic loads of
the secondary users to all the channels [135]. When a secondary trans-
mitter has data, it can transmit handshaking signal at the default chan-
nel of the intended receiver to establish a secondary connection [152].
92
lows:
1. In the beginning, SCA is established at its default channel Ch1. When
an interruption event occurs, SCA decides its target channel according
to the predetermined target channel sequence.
2. At the first interruption, SCA changes its operating channel to the idle
channel Ch2 from Ch1 because the first predetermined target channel
is Ch2. In this case, the handoff delay D1 is the channel switching time
(denoted by ts).
3. At the second interruption, SCA stays on its current operating channel
Ch2 because the second target channel is Ch2. SCA cannot be resumed
until all the high-priority primary connections finish their transmis-
sions at Ch2. In this case, the handoff delay D2 is the duration from
the time instant that Ch2 is used by the primary connections until the
time instant that the high-priority queue becomes empty. This du-
ration (denoted by Y
(2)
p ) is called the busy period resulting from the
transmissions of multiple primary connections at Ch2.
4. At the third interruption, SCA changes its operating channel to Ch3
because the third target channel is Ch3. In this example, because Ch3
is busy, SCA must wait in the low-priority queue until all the data in
the present high-priority and low-priority queues of Ch3 are served2.
2Here, the 1-persistent waiting policy is adopted. That is, the interrupted secondary
user must stay on the selected target channel even though the selected channel is busy and
then transmit unfinished data when channel becomes idle. Another possible approach is
to reselect a new channel at the next time slot when a busy channel is selected. However,
this approach is more impractical because it will lead to many channel-switching behaviors
during a secondary connection.

(5.7)
Proof. The handoff delay E[Di] depends on which channel is selected for
the target channel at the ith interruption. For the secondary connection
with (i − 1) interruptions, its current operating channel is si−1,η. When it
is interrupted again, its new operating channel is si,η. When si−1,η = si,η,
it means that the considered secondary connection will stay on the current
channel. When si−1,η 6= si,η, it represents that the considered secondary
connection will change its operating channel to another channel. Both cases
are discussed as follows.
(1) Staying case: When the considered secondary connection stays on
its current operating channel si,η = k, it cannot be resumed until all the

The value of E[W
(k′)
s ] can be derived as follows. Let E[Q
(k′)
p ] be the
average number of the primary connections which are waiting in the high-
priority queue of channel k′ and E[Q(k
′)
i ] be the average number of the type-i
secondary connections which are waiting in the low-priority queue of channel
k′. Because the newly arriving secondary connections cannot be established
until all the secondary connections in the low-priority queue and the primary
connections in the high-priority queue have been served, the average waiting
time of channel k′ is expressed as
E[W (k

s ] = E[R

p E[W
(k′)
s ]E[X
(k′)
p ] ,
(5.11)
where E[R
(k′)
s ] is the average residual effective service time of channel k′.
That is, E[R
(k′)
s ] is the remaining time to complete the service of the con-
nection being served at channel k′. This connection being served can be
the primary connection or the type-i secondary connection. Furthermore,
E[Q
(k′)
p ]E[X
(k′)
p ] and
∑∞
i=0E[Q
(k′)
i ]E[Φ
(k′)
i ] in (5.11) are the cumulative work-
load resulting from the primary connections and the secondary connections
in the present queues of channel k′, respectively. Moreover, the fourth term
(λ
(k′)
p E[W
(k′)
s ]E[X
(k′)
p ]) in (5.11) is the cumulative workload resulting from
the arrivals of the primary connections during W
(k′)
s .
In (5.11), the closed-form expression for E[Φ
(k′)
i ] is derived in Appendix
C. Next, we will derive E[R
(k′)
s ], E[Q
(k′)
p ], and E[Q
(k′)
i ]. Firstly, according to
tribution, the arrivals of the interrupted secondary connections at channel k′ also follow
Poisson distribution. Applying the property of Poisson arrivals see time average (PASTA)
on the arrivals of the interrupted secondary connections at channel k′ [153], all of them
must spend time duration E[W (k
′)
s ] on average to wait for an idle channel k′. This waiting
time is uncorrelated to the number of interruptions.

Proposition 2.
p
(k)
i =
 λ
(k)
p E[Φ
(k)
i ] , k = si,η
0 , k 6= si,η
. (5.18)
Proof. The value of p
(k)
i can be evaluated as follows. Because the considered
secondary connection will operate at channel si,η after i
th interruption, we
have p
(k)
i = 0 when k 6= si,η. Furthermore, for the case that k = si,η, we
consider the time interval [0, t] at channel k. Total λ
(k)
p t primary connec-
tions and ω
(k)
i t type-i secondary connections arrive at channel k during this
interval. Hence, there are total ω
(k)
i tp
(k)
i type-i secondary connections will
be interrupted on average during this interval. Furthermore, applying the
property of Poisson arrivals see time average (PASTA) on the arrivals of the
primary connections [153], we can obtain the probability of a primary connec-
tion finding channel k being occupied by the type-i secondary connections
is ρ
(k)
i . Thus, during this interval, the total λ
(k)
p tρ
(k)
i primary connections
can see a busy channel being occupied by the type-i secondary connections.
For each primary connection, it can interrupt only one secondary connection
when it arrives at a busy channel being occupied by the secondary connection
because only one secondary user can transmit at any instant of time. Thus,
the total number of the interrupted secondary connections at channel k is
also λ
(k)
p tρ
(k)
i . Hence, we have ω
(k)
i tp
(k)
i = λ

ρ

Next, we consider a type-i secondary connection at channel k. Before the
(i+1)th interruption event occurs, its effective service time is E[Φ
(k)
i ]. Thus,
from queueing theory, we can have
ρ

i = ω

neighboring channel. Without loss of generality, its corresponding target
channel sequence can be expressed as (Chη + 1, Chη + 2, · · · , ChM , Ch1,
Ch2, · · · , Chη, Chη + 1, · · · ), where channel η is the default channel of the
secondary connection. That is, at the ith interruption, the target channel of
the interrupted secondary connection is channel si,η ≡MOD(i+η,M) where
MOD(a, b) is the Modulus function and it returns the remainder resulting
when a is divided by b. Hence, we have E[Di] = E[W
(si,η)
s ] + ts for each i
in (5.4). Thus, the average extended data delivery time of the secondary
connections for the always-changing sequence can be expressed as follows:
E[Tchange] = E[X
(η)
s ] +
∞∑
n=1
[(
n∑
i=1
(E[W (si,η)s ] + ts)
)
(1− p(sn,η)i )
n−1∏
i=0
p
(si,η)
i
]
.
(5.22)
Based on the analytical results, the secondary connection can adaptively
adopt the better target channel sequence to reduce its extended data delivery
time. Thus, the average extended data delivery time with this adaptive
channel selection principle (denoted by E[T ∗]) can be expressed as follows:
E[T ∗] = min (E[Tstay],E[Tchange]) . (5.23)
5.5.2 An Example for Homogeneous Traffic Loads
Now, we give an example to explain how to apply our analytical results to find
the better target channel sequence when traffic parameters are given. We con-
sider a special case that the primary and the secondary connections have the
same traffic parameters in a three-channel system (i.e., λ
(1)
p = λ
(2)
p = λ
(3)
p ≡
λp, λ
(1)
s = λ
(2)
s ≡ λs, and E[X(1)p ] = E[X(2)p ] = E[X(3)p ] ≡ E[Xp]). Because
the three channels are identical, three channels have the same performance
metrics. Thus, the superscript (k) can be dropped to ease the notations.
Furthermore, we assume that the service time of the secondary connections
106
Then, referring to (5.18), it follows that
p
(si,η)
i = pi =
λp
λp + µs
. (5.30)
Finally, substituting (5.29) and (5.30) into (5.22), we can obtain the closed-
form expression for the extended data delivery time with the always-changing
target channel sequence. Note that this closed-form expression for pi in this
special case had been discussed in [127]. However, [127] cannot extend to the
case with the generally distributed service time.
In summary, the average extended data delivery time with our adaptive
target channel selection approach can be expressed as follows:
E[T ∗] =
 E[Tstay] , E[Yp] ≤ E[Ws] + tsE[Tchange] , E[Yp] ≥ E[Ws] + ts . (5.31)
Note that the always-staying and the always-changing sequences have the
same extended data delivery time when E[Yp] = E[Ws] + ts.
5.6 Numerical Results
We show numerical results to reveal the importance of the three key design
features for modeling spectrum handoffs as discussed in Section 5.1, which
consist of (1) generally distributed service time; (2) various operating chan-
nels; and (3) queueing behaviors of multiple secondary connections.
5.6.1 Simulation Setup
In order to validate the proposed analytical model, we perform simulations
in non-slot-based (continuous-time) cognitive radio systems, where the inter-
arrival time and service time can be the duration of non-integer time slots.
We consider a three-channel CR system with Poisson arrival processes of rates
108
and E[X
(1)
p ] = E[X
(2)
p ] = E[X

(slots/arrival) for the Pareto and the exponential distributions. Furthermore,
we consider that λs = 0.01 (arrivals/slot). Recall that ρp is the channel busy
probability resulting from the transmissions of the primary connections. We
only consider the case that 0 ≤ ρp < 1−λsE[Xs] = 0.9 in the following numer-
ical results. When ρp+λsE[Xs] ≥ 1 (or equivalently λp ≥ λsE[Xs]E[Xp] = 0.045 (ar-
rivals/slot)), the secondary connections will encounter the infinite extended
data delivery time on average.
Figure 5.3 compares the effects of Pareto and exponential service time
distributions for primary connections when the always-changing spectrum
handoff sequence is adopted. First, we find that the simulation results match
the analytical results quite well, which can validate the slot-based assump-
tion used in our analysis. Next, compared to the exponentially distributed
service time for primary connections, the Pareto distributed service time
results in longer average extended data delivery time in the secondary con-
nections. This phenomenon can be interpreted as follows. Because of the
heavy tail property of Pareto distribution, the second moment E[(Xp)
2] of
service time with Pareto distribution is larger than that with exponential
distribution. According to (5.29) and (5.22), an interrupted secondary con-
nection will encounter longer waiting time and extended data delivery time
when the primary connections’ service time distribution is Pareto. For ex-
ample, when ρp = 0.44 or equivalently λp =
ρp
E[Xp]
= 0.022 (arrivals/slot), the
average extended data delivery time with the Pareto-typed primary connec-
tion service time is four times longer than that with the exponential-typed
primary connection service time. Because the developed analytical frame-
work can characterize the effects of generally distributed service time, it is

adaptive channel selection approach can improve latency performance by
changing to the always-changing sequence. For example, when ρp = 0.2,
the traffic-adaptive approach can improve the extended data delivery time
by 15% compared to the always-staying sequence. Compared to the single-
channel spectrum handoff model [22–24,32, 51–55], the developed analytical
framework for multi-channel spectrum handoff is more general because it can
incorporate the effects of changing operating channels.

requirement. Fig. 5.7 shows the admissible region for the normalized traffic
workloads (or channel utilities) (ρp, ρs)
6 for the Voice over IP (VoIP) services.
The maximum allowable average cumulative delay resulting from multiple
handoffs is 20 ms for the VoIP traffic [156]. Assume E[Xp] = 20 (slots/arrival)
and E[Xs] = 10 (slots/arrival). The admission control policy can be designed
according to this figure. When ρp < 0.166, a CR network can accept all
arrival requests from the secondary users until the CR network is saturated,
i.e., ρp + ρs ' 1. Furthermore, when 0.166 < ρp < 0.312, a part of traffic
workloads of the secondary users must be rejected in order to satisfy the
delay constraint for the secondary users. In this case, 0.31 < ρp+ρs < 0.645.
For example, when ρp = 0.25, a CR network can support at most 0.214
workload for the secondary users. That is, a CR network can accept at
most λs = 0.0214 (arrivals/slot) based on the results shown in the figure
when λp = 0.0125 (arrivals/slot). In order to design the most allowable
λs to achieve this arrival rate upper bound for the secondary connections,
many arrival-rate control methods can be considered, such as the p-persistent
carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol in [25] and the call admission
control mechanisms in [50, 63, 157]. Finally, when ρp > 0.312, no secondary
user can be accepted.
5.6.4 Performance Comparison between Different Chan-
nel Selection Methods
Now we compare the extended data delivery time of the following three
schemes: (1) the slot-based target channel selection scheme; (2) the random-
based target channel selection scheme; and (3) the traffic-adaptive target
channel selection scheme. We consider a three-channel network with various

p ]) = (5, 15, 25) (slots/arrival), and
(E[X
(1)
s ],E[X
(2)
s ],E[X
(3)
s ]) = (15, 15, 15) (slots/arrival). For the slot-based
scheme, the secondary connections prefer selecting the channel which has
the lowest busy probability resulting from the primary connections in each
time slot. That is, when handoff procedures are initiated in the beginning of
each time slot, all the secondary connections will select channel 1 to be their
target channels. Furthermore, the random-based scheme selects one channel
out of all the three channels for the target channel. Hence, each channel
is selected with probability 1/3. Moreover, based on the considered traffic
parameters, the traffic-adaptive scheme will adopt the always-changing se-
quence and the always-staying sequence when λp ≤ 0.018 (arrivals/slot) and
λp ≥ 0.018 (arrivals/slot), respectively. The three target channel selection
schemes result in various target channel sequences. Based on the proposed
analytical model, we can evaluate the average extended data delivery time
resulting from these target channel sequences.
Figure 5.8 compares the extended data delivery time of the three target
channel selection methods. We have the following three important obser-
vations. First, we consider λp < 0.018 (arrivals/slot). Because the proba-
bility of changing operating channel is higher than that of staying on the
current operating channel for the interrupted secondary user in the random-
based scheme, we can find that the average extended data delivery time for
the random-based target channel selection scheme is similar to that for the
traffic-adaptive target channel selection scheme, which adopts the always-
changing sequence. Secondly, when λp > 0.018 (arrivals/slot), the traffic-
adaptive scheme can shorten the average extended data delivery time be-
cause it adopts the always-staying sequence. For a larger value of λp, the

Optimal Proactive Spectrum
Handoff
Extended to the discussions of the proactive spectrum handoff in Chapter
5, we further investigate how to predetermine the optimal target channel
sequence for future handoffs. We incorporate two important features in the
design of spectrum handoff to ensure the quality of service (QoS) for the
secondary users. First, due to multiple interruptions from the primary users
in each secondary user’s connection, a series of spectrum handoffs are consid-
ered in our model. Secondly, we consider the impacts of the traffic statistics
of both the primary and secondary users on the handoff delay.
In this chapter, we formulate an optimization problem of finding a target
channel sequence for multiple handoffs with the objective of minimizing the
cumulative delay per connection for a newly arriving secondary user. We
will simultaneously consider two design features in spectrum handoffs: (1)
multiple spectrum handoffs and (2) various service time of the primary and
secondary users. The contributions of this chapter can be summarized in the
following:
120
sequence for L spectrum handoffs, we aim to determine a target channel se-
quence (denoted by s(η)∗) to minimize the average cumulative handoff delay
E[D(s(η))] for a newly arriving secondary user’s connection. Formally, we
have
s(η)∗ = argmin
∀s(η)∈ΩL
E[D(s(η))] , (6.1)
where E[·] is the expectation function. In the next section, the closed-form
expression for E[D(s(η))] will be derived given the arrival rates and service
time distributions of both primary and secondary users.
6.2 Cumulative Handoff Delay Analysis
In this section, we derive the closed-form expression for the average cumula-
tive handoff delay with different target channel sequence s(η) of the newly
arriving secondary user’s connection. To ease notation, we denote s for s(η)
in the rest of this chapter. Let N be the total number of interruptions in
the considered connection. According to the total probability principle, it
follows that
E[D(s)] =
L∑
n=1
Pr{N = n}E[D(s)|N = n]
=
L∑
n=1
[
Pr{N = n}
n∑
i=1
E[d(si−1, si)]
]
, (6.2)
where d(si−1, si) is the handoff delay when the interrupted secondary users
change their operating channel from channel si−1 to si.
Firstly, we evaluate E[d(si−1, si)] in (6.2). When a primary user’s connec-
tion appears at the channel being occupied by the newly arriving secondary
user’s connection, an interruption event occurs. The spectrum handoff delay
depends on which channel is selected for the target channel. The interrupted
122
n times can be expressed as
Pr{N = n} = (1− p(sn)n )
n−1∏
i=0
p

i . (6.4)
Now, we apply the proposed preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1
queueing network model in Chapters 3 and 4 [158] to derive the closed-form
expressions for E[d(si−1, si)] and Pr{N = n}. Let λ(η)p (arrivals/slot) and λ(η)s
(arrivals/slot) be the initial arrival rates of the primary users’ and secondary
users’ connections at channel η in G, respectively, and X(η)p (slots/arrival)
and X
(η)
s (slots/arrival) be their corresponding service time, respectively.
Furthermore, we assume that the existing secondary users’ connections in
G must stay on the current operating channel when they are interrupted.
Then, referring to [135], a newly arriving secondary user’s connection will
experience the following performance measures:

k. When the service time (denoted by χs) of the considered newly arriving
secondary connection is given, we can derive the closed-form expression for
E[Φ
(k)

Figure 6.1: An example of state diagram of the target channel sequences for a
newly arriving secondary user, where the default channel η = 1, the number
of total channels M = 3, and the required length of the target channel
sequence L = 4. Furthermore, (k, i) stands for the state of operating at the
channel k with the ith interruption.
6.3.1 State Diagram for Target Channel Sequences
The proposed state diagram is a two-dimensional chain where state (k, i)
represents that channel k is selected for the target channel at the ith inter-
ruption. Because the default channel is channel η, the initial state of this
state diagram model is (η, 0). Furthermore, the set of all possible states for
the ith interruption is called stage i. The state transitions occur only at the
states between the adjacent stages. Specifically, a transition link from (k, i)
to (k′, i′) exists if i′ = i+ 1, and vice versa. An example of state diagram is
shown in Fig. 6.1, where η = 1, M = 3, and L = 4.
The cost of state transition shall be proportional to the handoff delay
of the interrupted secondary user’s connection. For example, the transition
from states (k, i − 1) to (k, i) represents the situation that the considered
secondary user’s connection stays on the current channel k when the ith

Furthermore, from (6.2), we can have

. (6.12)
Comparing (6.11) and (6.12), we can obtain (6.10).
6.3.2 Optimal Substructure Property
Next, we show that this optimization problem has the optimal substructure
property based on the proposed state diagram. Letm(k′, i) be the cumulative
cost of the minimum cost path from the initial state (η, 0) to the state (k′, i)
where i ≥ 1. Then, we have the following recursive relationship:
m(k′, i+ 1) = min
k∈Ω
{m(k, i) + w(k; k′, i+ 1)} , (6.13)
where
m(k′, 1) = w(η; k′, 1)

Based on this optimal substructure, we can build an optimal solution to the
considered optimization problem from the optimal solutions to the subprob-
lems. Then, the shortest cumulative handoff delay (denoted by m∗) can be
obtained as follows:

6.4 A Suboptimal Low-Complexity Greedy Al-
gorithm
In the section we present a suboptimal greedy algorithm to further reduce the
time complexity of solving theCumulative Handoff Delay Minimization
Problem. Based on the suggested greedy target channel selection strategy,
the proposed greedy algorithm has time complexity of O(M).
6.4.1 Greedy Target Channel Selection Strategy
In each spectrum handoff, the greedy target channel selection strategy is sug-
gested to select the channel with the shortest expected handoff delay. Some
permutations of the target channel sequences will never occur when this
shortest-handoff-delay strategy is adopted. Here, we give such an example.
Consider a secondary user’s connection whose default channel is channel 1
(Ch1). In a two-channel system, it can select either channel 1 or channel
2 (Ch2) for its target channel when an interruption event occurs. Now, we
assume that the average busy period of Ch1 (denoted by E[Y
(1)
p ]) is shorter
than the sum of channel switching time (denoted by ts) and the average
waiting time of Ch2 (denoted by E[W
(2)
s ]). Hence, when the first inter-
ruption occurs and the greedy target channel selection strategy is adopted,
the secondary user selects Ch1 as its target channel for spectrum handoff.
The similar argument can be held again for all the upcoming interruptions.
That is, the target channel sequence will be (Ch1, Ch1, Ch1, Ch1, Ch1, · · · ).
In this case, some permutations of the target channel sequences, such as
130
to a new channel. Now, we discuss what conditions will cause target chan-
nel sequences not to be considered by the greedy target channel selection
strategy.
(1) At the first interruption: The secondary user can select channel
α or channel k (k ∈ Ω/{α}) for the target channel. If staying on channel α,
the expected delay for the non-hopping spectrum handoff equals the average
busy period of the primary users’ connections at channel α (denoted by
E[Y
(α)
p ]). If changing its operating channel to channel k, the secondary user
will experience the delay of the hopping spectrum handoff, which is equal
to the sum of the channel switching time (denoted by ts) and the average
waiting time on channel k (denoted by E[W
(k)
s ]). On the one hand, if the
following condition (C1) is satisfied,
(C1) : E[Y (α)p ] ≤ min∀k∈Ω/{α}{E[W
(k)
s ] + ts} ,
channel α is the first element in the target channel sequence. This implies
that the interrupted secondary user must wait until all the primary users’
connections leave channel α. When the traffic statistics of all channels are
stationary, the interrupted secondary user will always stay on channel α
because (C1) always can be satisfied for all the upcoming interruptions.
That is, the target channel sequence becomes (α, α, α, α, α, α, · · · ), as shown
in Fig. 6.2. On the other hand, if the condition
(C2) :

β = argmin
∀k∈Ω/{α}
E[W (k)s ]
E[W
(β)
s ] + ts < E[Y
(α)
p ]
is satisfied, the first element in the target channel sequence is channel β.
Clearly, (C2) is not sufficient to determine the remaining elements in the
target channel sequence.
132
elements in the target channel sequence, the third interruption event
will be considered.
(3) At the third interruption: In this case, we need to compare the
expected handoff delay of staying on channel γ and that of switching back to
channels α and β, i.e., E[Y
(γ)
p ], E[W
(α)
s ] + ts, and E[W
(β)
s ] + ts, respectively.
Given (C2) and (C5), three different situations exist.
• First of all, if the condition
(C6) : E[Y (γ)p ] ≤ min∀k∈Ω/{γ}{E[W
(k)
s ] + ts}
is satisfied, the interrupted secondary user prefers staying on channel
γ. Hence, (C2), (C5), and (C6) result in the target channel sequence
(β, γ, γ, γ, · · · ).
• Furthermore, if the condition
(C7) : E[W (α)s ] + ts < min{ min∀k∈Ω/{α,γ}{E[W
(k)
s ] + ts},E[Y (γ)p ]}
is satisfied, the interrupted secondary user switches back to channel α.
Then, (C2) and (C5) will make this secondary user switches to channel
β and channel γ at the fourth and fifth interruptions, respectively.
Thus, when (C2), (C5) and (C7) are satisfied, the target channel
sequence becomes (β, γ, α, β, γ, α, β, γ, α, · · · ).
• Similarly, when
(C8) : E[W (β)s ] + ts < min{ min∀k∈Ω/{β,γ}{E[W
(k)
s ] + ts},E[Y (γ)p ]}
is satisfied, one can show that the target channel sequence is (β, γ, β, γ, β, γ, · · · ).

6.4.2 Greedy Target Channel Selection Algorithm
The shortest-handoff-delay strategy is adopted to select the target channel
in the proposed greedy algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 2. Hence, this
Algorithm 2 has time complexity of O(M).

According to Fig. 6.2, determining the target channel sequence.
6.5 Numerical Results
In this section, by applying the proposed analytical models to the environ-
ments with various statistics of service time distributions for both primary
and secondary users, we show the cumulative spectrum handoff delay perfor-
mance for the proposed target channel sequence design approaches subject
to the effects of multiple handoffs. Five target channel selection schemes
are compared, which consist of (1) the random selection strategy; (2) the
throughput-orientated strategy; (3) the greedy shortest-handoff-delay target
channel selection strategy; (4) the dynamic programming (DP)-based solu-
tion; and (5) the exhaustive search (ES)-based solution. For the random se-
lection strategy, the secondary user randomly selects one channel for its target
channel when an interruption event occurs. Furthermore, the throughput-
136
optimal solution when the primary user service time has similar distri-
butions in different channels, where (E[X
(1)
p ],E[X
(2)
p ],E[X
(3)
p ],E[X
(4)
p ])
= (14, 15, 15, 15), and (E[X
(1)
s ],E[X
(2)
s ],E[X
(3)
s ],E[X
(4)
s ]) = (10, 12, 14, 16).
However, if the primary user’s service time distributions of each channel
are different, the cumulative handoff delay resulting from the suggested
greedy strategy is slightly larger than the optimal solution. For ex-
ample, when (E[X
(1)
p ],E[X
(2)
p ],E[X
(3)
p ],E[X
(4)
p ]) = (10, 15, 20, 25) and
(E[X
(1)
s ],E[X
(2)
s ],E[X
(3)
s ],E[X
(4)
s ]) = (10, 10, 10, 10), Fig. 6.3(b) shows
that the cumulative handoff delay of the greedy strategy is 9% higher
than that of the optimal solution at E[χs] = 20 .
• When the arrival rates and service time of the secondary users’ con-
nections are the same at all the four channels as shown in Fig. 6.3(b),
the throughput-orientated strategy and the suggested greedy strategy
result in the same cumulative handoff delay. However, when the sec-
ondary users’ connections have different traffic statistics as shown in
Fig. 6.3(a), it is shown that at E[χs] = 20 the greedy strategy improves
the cumulative handoff delay of the throughput-orientated strategy by
46%. This is because the suggested greedy strategy takes into account
of the traffic statistics of both the primary and secondary users when
determining the target channel.
6.5.2 Effects of Traffic Statistics of Existing Secondary
Users’ Connections
Figure 6.4 shows how the existing secondary connections’ traffic statistics,
including the average service time E[Xs] and the arrival rate λs, affect the
cumulative handoff delay of the newly arriving secondary user’s connection.

6.5.3 Effects of Traffic Statistics of Existing Primary
Users’ Connections
Figure 6.5 shows the effects of the average service time E[Xp] and the arrival
rate λp of the primary users’ connections on the cumulative handoff delay
of the newly arriving secondary user’s connection. We consider that λ
(k)
s =
λs and E[X
(k)
s ] = E[Xs] for 1 ≤ k ≤ 4 as well as the service time χs is
geometrically distributed and E[χs] = 10. In Fig. 6.5(a), we assume that
E[X
(k)
p ] = E[Xp] for 1 ≤ k ≤ 4. We can find the following:
• For all methods, the cumulative handoff delay increases as E[Xp] in-
creases because a larger value of E[Xp] results in heavier traffic load.
• For the throughput-orientated strategy, the greedy strategy, and the
optimal solution, their cumulative handoff delay at various E[Xp] will
ultimately converge to the same value as shown in the region of E[Xp] ≥
13 in Fig. 6.5(a). In the region, the handoff delay is only related to
the busy period E[Yp] and uncorrelated to the value of E[Xs] because
the interrupted secondary users always stay on the current operating
channel when E[Xp] ≥ 13.
Note that we can have the similar conclusions in Fig. 6.5(b), where λ
(k)
p = λp
for 1 ≤ k ≤ 4.

on the channel utilization and the extended data delivery time of the sec-
ondary users’ connections with various traffic arrival rates and service time
distributions. We consider the three key design features for spectrum han-
odff, consisting of (1) heterogeneous arrival rates of the primary users at
different channels, where various channels have different traffic arrival rates
of the primary users because these channels may belong to different primary
system operators; (2) various arrival rates of the secondary users at different
channels, where the arrival rates can be determined by the initial operating
channel selection mechanisms [135]; and (3) handoff processing time, result-
ing from the sensing time, the handshaking time, and the channel switching
time. How to model the channel utilization at each channel and the extended
data delivery time in the context of multiple handoffs is challenging since the
operating channels for multiple handoffs are selected according to the chan-
nel occupancy states at the moments of link transitions. To the best of our
knowledge, an analytical model for characterizing all the three features for
multiple handoffs has rarely been seen in the literature. The contributions
of this chapter are summarized in the following:
• First, The preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing network
model is proposed to characterize the channel usage behaviors of CR
networks. Based on this queueing model, we can evaluate the channel
utilizations of different channels under various traffic arrival rates and
service time distributions.
• Next, a state diagram is developed to characterize the effect of multiple
handoff delay on the extended data delivery time of the secondary con-
nections. Then, we can evaluate how long the extended data delivery
time is prolonged due to multiple spectrum hanodffs.

sion period of the secondary connection SCA, where SCA’s initial (default)
channel is Ch3. We assume that the transmitter of SCA wants to establish
a connection flow with 30 slots to the corresponding receiver. Its extended
data delivery time is denoted by T . Furthermore, Di is the handoff delay of
the ith interruption. Here, the handoff delay is defined as the duration from
the instant that transmission is interrupted until the instant that the unfin-
ished transmission is resumed. Then, the transmission process with multiple
handoffs is described as follows:
1. In the beginning, SCA is established at its default channel Ch3. When
an interruption event occurs, SCA performs spectrum sensing to search
the idle channel for spectrum handoff.
2. At the first interruption, SCA changes its operating channel to the idle
channel Ch2 from Ch3. Thus, the handoff delay D1 is δc.
3. At the second interruption, SCA stays on its current operating channel
Ch2 because all channels are busy. SCA cannot be resumed until all the
high-priority primary connections at Ch2 finish their transmissions. In
this case, the handoff delay D2 is the sum of δs and the duration from
the time instant that Ch2 is used by the primary users’ connections
until the time instant that the high-priority queue becomes empty. This
duration (denoted by Y
(2)
p ) is called the busy period resulting from the
transmissions of multiple primary users’ connections at Ch2.
4. At the third interruption, SCA finds both Ch1 and Ch3 are idle. Then,
SCA randomly selects one channel to be the target channel. In this
example, SCA selects Ch1 to be its target channel. Note that the
handoff delay D3 in this case is δc.

s . Figure 7.2 shows an example of the PRP M/G/1 queue-
ing network model with three channels. The traffic flows of the primary
connections and the secondary connections are directly connected to the
high-priority queue and the low-priority queue, respectively. A secondary
connection will be interrupted when the primary connection appears. The
interrupted secondary connection can decide its target channel for spectrum
handoff according to the instantaneous spectrum sensing outcomes. Note
that the required time for spectrum sensing is modeled in S . It can be
regarded as a tapped delay line or a server with constant service time, which
equals to the handoff processing time. In the proposed queueing network,
the interrupted secondary connection can either stay on its current chan-
nel or change to another channel through different feedback paths. If the
interrupted secondary connection chooses to stay on its current operating
channel, its remaining data will be connected to the head of the low-priority
queue of its current operating channel. On the other hand, if the decision
is to change its operating channel, the remaining data of the interrupted
secondary connection can be connected to the empty low-priority queue of
the selected channel. In the figure, ⊕ represents that the traffic of the inter-
rupted secondary connection is merged. Furthermore, when the interrupted
secondary connection transmits the remaining data on the target channel, it
may be interrupted again. Hence, this model can incorporate the effects of
multiple interruptions.
7.2.1 Notations
Now, we define some notations as follows. We call the secondary connection
that has experienced i interruptions, where i ≥ 0, the type-i secondary con-
nection. Firstly, we consider the type-i secondary connections whose default
152
channels are the channel η. Two more important system parameters ω
(k)
i,η and
Φ
(k)
i,η are defined as follows:
• ω(k)i,η is the arrival rate of the considered secondary connections at chan-
nel k. Note that ω
(η)
0,η = λ
(η)
s . How to derive ω
(k)
i,η from the four traffic
parameters is discussed in Section 7.3.
• Φ(k)i,η is the effective service time of the considered secondary connections
at channel k. That is, Φ
(k)
i,η is the considered secondary connection’s
transmission duration between the ith and the (i+1)th interruptions at
channel k. In Section 7.3, we will discuss how to derive E[Φ
(k)
i,η ] from
the four traffic parameters.
Next, let ω
(k)
i and Φ
(k)
i be the arrival rate and the effective service time of
the type-i secondary connections at channel k, respectively. We can have

Finally, we denote ρ

p and ρ

i as the channel busy probabilities resulting
from the transmissions of the primary connections and the type-i secondary
connections whose current operating channels are the channel k, respectively.

7.3 Analysis of Channel Utilization Factor
Based on the proposed PRP M/G/1 queueing network model, we can evalu-
ate many performance measures of CR networks with various traffic param-
eters. In this section, we show how to evaluate the channel utilization factor
ρ(k). Referring to (7.5), for each channel k (1 ≤ k ≤M), it follows that

Note that ρ(k) is unrelated to channel sensing time τ , channel notification
time tn, and channel switching time ts. In (7.6), λ
(k)
p and E[X
(k)
p ] are system
parameters and can be known in advance. In the following, we will show how
to derive ω
(k)
i,η and E[Φ
(k)
i,η ].
156
7.3.1 Derivations of ω
(k)
i,η and E[Φ
(k)
i,η ]
Without loss of generality, we consider a secondary connection whose default
channel is channel η , s0 in the following discussions. Its target channel
sequence is denoted by S(η) , (S1,η, S2,η, S3,η, · · · ), where Si,η is the target
channel at the ith interruption. Note that Si,η is a random variable for each
i ≥ 1. It is decided according to the instantaneous sensing results after the
ith interruption event occurs. Thus, S(η) is a random sequence. Based on
the definitions of these notations, ω
(k)
i,η and E[Φ
(k)
i,η ] can be derived from the
Propositions 8 and 9, respectively. Then, the channel utilization ρ(k) can be
obtained.
Lemma 5. Let p
(k)
i,η be the probability that the considered type-i secondary
connection is interrupted again at channel k. It follows that
p
(k)
i,η = λ
(k)
p E[Φ
(k)
i,η ] . (7.7)
Proof of this lemma can be found in [159].
Definition 6. Let sn , (s1, s2, s3, · · · , sn) be any target channel sequence
which has n elements. That is, sn ∈ Ωn, where Ω = {1, 2, · · · ,M}.
Claim 7. Denote Pr[Si,η = si|Si−1,η = si−1] as the probability that the con-
sidered secondary connection will select the channel si to be its target channel
when an interruption event occurs at the channel si−1. Then, we have

The values of ω
(k→k′)
i+1,η can be evaluated as follows. For the type-i sec-
ondary connection at the channel k, it will be interrupted again with prob-
ability p
(k)
i,η . When an interruption event occurs at the channel k, the type-i
secondary connection must search its target channel for spectrum handoff
through spectrum sensing. Without loss of generality, we assume that the
channel k′ is selected to be the target channel. This situation occurs with
probability Pr[Si+1,η = k
′|Si,η = k]. When channel k′ is selected, the type-i
secondary connection will turn into a new arrival of the type-(i+1) secondary
connection at channel k′. Hence, we can have (7.10).
Proposition 9. Based on the proposed PRP M/G/1 queueing network model,
we can derive the closed-form expression for E[Φ
(k)
i,η ].
Proof. According to the total probability principle, we have
E[Φ

i,η ] =
L∑
N=1
∑
∀sN∈ΩN
Pr[S(η) = sN ]E[Φ
(k)

where L is the maximum number of interruptions among all secondary users’
connections, i.e., the maximum length of the target channel sequence. Based
on the proposed queueing network, we can derive E[Φ
(k)
i,η |S(η) = sN ] for any
given sN can been derived when λ
(k)
p , λ
(k)
s , f
(k)
p (x), and f
(k)
s (x) are given. The
derivation detail can be found in [159]. As to Pr[S(η), it can be expressed as
follows:
Pr[S(η) = sN ] = (1− p(sN )N,η )
N∏
i=1
Pr[Si,η = si|Si−1,η = si−1] , (7.12)
where S0,η is the default channel s0 = η. By substituting (7.7) and (7.8) into
(7.12), the value of Pr[S(η) = sN ] can be obtained.
160
7.4 Analysis of Extended Data Delivery Time
In this section, we show how to evaluate the extended data delivery time,
which is an important performance measure for the latency-sensitive traffic
of the secondary connections. Without loss of generality, we consider the
secondary connection whose default channel is the channel η in the following
discussions. It extended data delivery time consists of the original service
time X
(η)
s and the cumulative delay resulting from multiple handoffs E[D(η)].
Let E[D|S(η) = sN ] be its cumulative handoff delay when its target channel
is sN . Then, its average extended data delivery time (denoted by E[T
(η)])
can be expressed as
E[T (η)] = E[X(η)s ] + E[D
(η)]
= E[X(η)s ] +
L∑
N=0
∑
∀sN∈ΩN
Pr{S(η) = sN}E[D|S(η) = sN ] .(7.16)
Hence, in order to calculate E[T (η)], we will show how to evaluate Pr{S(η) =
sN} and E[D|S(η) = sN ] in the following.
7.4.1 Derivations of Pr{S(η) = sN} and E[D|S(η) = sN ]
In order to evaluate Pr{S(η) = sN} and E[D|S(η) = sN ], a state diagram
is developed by characterizing the evolutions of the target channel sequence
and the corresponding cumulative handoff delay for the secondary connec-
tion. The proposed state diagram is a two-dimensional chain. Because the
considered secondary’s default channel is η, the initial state of this state di-
agram is (η, 0). Next, the state (k, i), where 1 ≤ k ≤M , represents that the
channel k is selected for the target channel at the ith interruption. The state
(M +1, i) represents that the secondary user can finish its transmission after
the (i− 1)th interruption, and thus the state (M +1, i) is the ending of state
162
ing. The probability that each channel is selected to be the target channel
is related to the statistics of channel occupancy. Let P [(k′, i)|(k, i − 1)] be
the transition probability from states (k, i − 1) to (k′, i). At channel k, the
considered secondary connection may do not experience interruption again
and can finish its transmission at channel k. In this case, the transition from
states (k, i − 1) to (M + 1, i) will occur. On the other hand, the transi-
tion from states (k, i − 1) to (k′, i) where 1 ≤ k′ ≤ M will occur when the
considered secondary connection is interrupted again at channel k. Thus,
P [(k′, i)|(k, i− 1)] can be expressed as follows:
P [(k′, i)|(k, i− 1)] =
 1− p
(k)
i−1,η , k
′ =M + 1
p
(k)
i−1,η ·Pr[Si,η = k′|Si−1,η = k] , k′ 6=M + 1
.
(7.17)
State Transition Cost
The cost of state transition is defined as the handoff delay of the interrupted
secondary connection. The handoff delay from channels k to k′ depends on
the state of channel occupancy. Recall that δs and δc are the total processing
time for executing spectrum handoff procedure when the secondary users
stay on the current channel and change to another channel, respectively. If
one idle channel exists after spectrum sensing, the interrupted secondary
connection will change to this idle channel. Hence, the handoff delay in this
case is δc. Furthermore, if all channels are busy, the interrupted secondary
connection will stay on its current operating channel (i.e., k = k′). Hence,
the expected handoff delay is the sum of δs and the duration from the time
instant that channel k is used by the primary connections until the time
instant that channel k becomes idle. This duration is called the busy period
resulting from the transmissions of multiple primary connections at channel
164
complex. Fortunately, the derivations of the cumulative handoff delay can be
simplified due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution.
Without loss of generality, we consider the secondary connection whose
default channel is the channel k. It cumulative handoff delay E[D(k)] in
(7.16) can be derived as follows. Because the considered secondary connec-
tion’s service time distribution is the exponential distribution, its remaining
service time after an interruption event occurs also follows the identical ex-
ponential distribution. Hence, for the secondary connections at state (k, i)
and (k′, i′), they will experience the same cumulative handoff delay and in-
terrupted probability in their remaining transmissions if k = k′, k 6=M + 1,
and k′ 6=M + 1.
From the aforementioned discussions, we can re-plot the state diagram
expression for the target channel selection as a tree-structured representation
as shown in Fig. 7.5, where Chk represents that channel k is selected for the
target channel and the “grounding symbols” represent the endings of state
transition. Note that at the second stage of Fig. 7.5, the average cumulative
handoff delay of the type-1 secondary connection is equal to E[D(k)] when
this type-1 secondary connection’s current operating channel is the channel
k. Furthermore, because the state transition probability is independent of
the number of interruptions for the secondary connections due to memoryless
property, we can have P [(k′, i + 1)|(k, i)] = P [k′|k] for each i ≥ 0. Hence, it
follows that
E[D(k)] = P [M+1|k] ·C[M+1|k]+
M∑
k′=1
P [k′|k] ·(C[k′|k]+E[D(k′)]) , (7.22)
for any k where 1 ≤ k ≤ M . Finally, substituting (7.17) and (7.18) into
(7.22), we can obtain M independent equations. Hence, the closed-form
expressions for the cumulative handoff delay E[D(k)] can be derived by solving
these simultaneous equations iteratively.
166
7.5 Numerical Results
We show numerical results to reveal the importance of the three key design
features for modeling spectrum handoffs, which consist of (1) various arrival
rates of the secondary users’ connections; (2) heterogeneous arrival rates of
the primary users’ connections; and (3) the handoff processing time.
7.5.1 Simulation Setting
In order to validate the proposed analytical model, we perform simulations
based on the Monte-carlo method in non-slot-based (continuous-time) cogni-
tive radio systems, where the inter-arrival time and service time can be the
duration of non-integer time slots. We consider a two-channel CR system
with Poisson arrival processes of rates λp and λs for the high-priority primary
connections and the low-priority secondary connections, respectively. The
high-priority connections can interrupt the transmissions of the low-priority
connections, and the connections with the same priority follow the first-come-
first-served (FCFS) scheduling discipline1. Referring to the IEEE 802.22
standard, we adopt time slot duration of 10 msec in our simulations [145].
7.5.2 Effects of Various Arrival Rates for the Secondary
Users’ Connections
Firstly, we investigate the effects of various arrival rate for secondary users’
connections on the channel utilization and the extended data delivery time
1In fact, the analytical results of mean values obtained in this report can be applied
to other scheduling discipline which is independent of the service time of the primary
and secondary connections because the averages of system performance metrics will be
invariant to the order of service in this case (see page 113 in [134]).

Figure 7.7 shows the effects of the arrival rate of the primary connections
(λp) on the extended data delivery time of the secondary connections whose
initial default channels are the channels 1 and 2. We have three important
observations. First of all, because the channels 1 and 2 have the same arrival
rate of the primary connections, the secondary connections at the two chan-
nels will encounter same interrupted probability according to (7.14). Hence,

nections whose initial channels are the channels 1 and 2. We can find that
the extended data delivery time of the secondary connections increases as λs
increases because a larger λs will lead to a higher channel busy probabilities
as shown in Fig. 7.8. Furthermore, the secondary connections whose initial
channel is channel 2 has shorter extended data delivery time compared to
the secondary connections whose initial channel is channel 1. This is because
the secondary connections whose initial channel is channel 2 can have lower
interrupted probability and the smaller number of interruptions during their
transmission period.
7.5.4 Effects of Handoff Processing Time
Finally, we discuss the effects of handoff processing time. A two-channel
CR network is considered with the following parameters: tn = 0 (slot),
ts = 1 (slot), λ
(1)
p = λ
(2)
p , λp, λ(1)s = λ(2)s = 0.02 (arrivals/slot), E[X(1)p ] =
E[X
(2)
p ] = 5 (slots/arrival) and E[X
(1)
s ] = E[X
(2)
s ] = 10 (slots/arrival). Then,
based on the proposed analytical model, we can evaluate the average ex-
tended data delivery time and then design the admission control rule for the
secondary users as shown in Figs. 7.10 and 7.11.
Figure 7.10 compares the cumulative handoff delay of the following three
target channel selection schemes: (1) the always-staying strategy; (2) the
random selection strategy; and (3) the reactive selection strategy. For the
always-staying approach, the interrupted secondary user always stays on its
default channel to resume its unfinished data transmission. The method
is one kind of proactive spectrum handoff [141] because the target chan-
nels are predetermined and it is similar to the non-hopping mode of IEEE
802.22 [126]. In the random selection approach, the interrupted user ran-
domly selects a target channel from all channels. From this figure, we have
174
the following three important observations. First, we find that the cumu-
lative handoff delay resulting from the random selection method is longer
than that resulting from the always-staying strategy when λp ≥ 0.052. For a
larger value of λp, the interrupted secondary users with the random selection
method must spend much more time to wait when it changes its operat-
ing channel because this selected target channel is likely busy. Thus, the
handoff delay of the random selection method becomes longer in this case.
Next, it is shown that the reactive spectrum handoff can result in the short-
est cumulative handoff delay in the ideal sensing case (i.e., τ = 0) because
it can reliably find idle channels by performing spectrum sensing. In this
case, the cumulative handoff delay can be shortened around 40% compared
to the other approaches under various arrival rates of the primary users’ con-
nections. However, when the spectrum sensing time becomes longer (e.g.,
τ = 4), the reactive spectrum handoff is worse than the random selection
method in terms of cumulative handoff delay when λp ≤ 0.071. Finally, we
find that the sensing technology can effectively shorten the average cumula-
tive handoff delay only when τ ≤ 2 compared to the always-staying strategy.
The analytical results developed in this chapter can be used to design
the admission control rule for the arriving secondary users subject to their
latency requirement. Fig. 7.11 shows the admissible region for the normalized
traffic workloads (or channel utilities) (ρp, ρs)
2 for the Voice over IP (VoIP)
services when τ = 0 (slot). The maximum allowable average cumulative
delay resulting from multiple handoffs is 20 ms for the VoIP traffic [156].
The admission control policy can be designed according to this figure. When
ρp < 0.1667, a CR network can accept all arrival requests from the secondary
users until the CR network is saturated, i.e., ρp+ρs ' 1. Furthermore, when
2ρp = λpE[Xp] and ρs = λsE[Xs].

secondary users. Our cross-layer design can incorporate the effects in the
physical, medium access control (MAC), and application layers. In the phys-
ical layer, we incorporate the sensing errors for missed detection as well as
false alarm, and power outage. In the MAC layer, traffic admission prob-
ability for the secondary users is considered. In the application layer, we
consider the traffic statistics and QoS constraints of both the primary and
the secondary users. The proposed analytical approach can calculate the
optimal traffic admission probability under various cross-layer parameters.
Furthermore, it also provides useful insights into the tradeoff design between
channel utilization and the QoS performances for the primary as well as
secondary users. To our knowledge, such a PHY/MAC/APP cross-layer an-
alytical approach to determine the optimal traffic admission probability for
CR networks has rarely been seen in the literature.
8.1 Motivation
In order to satisfy the two QoS constraints, the secondary users must be
able to accurately sense the presence of the primary users. However, missed
detection and false alarm may occur because the perfect sensing is impossible.
Missed detection occurs when the detector reports the absence of a primary
user while it is present. In this case, the transmission of the primary users
will be affected by the secondary users. On the contrary, false alarm occurs
when the detector mistakenly reports the presence of a primary user. In this
situation, the secondary users cannot transmit data even though channel is
indeed idle, which cause the transmission latency of the secondary users.
Basically, a smaller missed detection probability implies a larger false alarm
probability, and vice versa, which is a performance tradeoff design issue [143].
182
8.2 System Model
8.2.1 Assumptions
In CR networks, there are four key system parameters. Assume that the
arrival processes of the primary and the secondary users’ connections are
Poisson. Denote λp (arrivals/slot) and λs (arrivals/slot) as the traffic arrival
rates of the primary and the secondary users’ connections, respectively. Fur-
thermore, let Xp (slots/arrival) and Xs (slots/arrival) be the service time of
the primary users’ connections and the secondary users’ connections, respec-
tively. Then, the probability density functions of Xp and Xs are denoted by
fp(x) and fs(x), respectively.
The service time of the primary and secondary connections will be ex-
tended due to imperfect sensing and power outage. Denote PM and PF
as missed detection and false alarm probabilities, respectively. Their rela-
tionship can be characterized by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve [143]. When missed detections occur, the primary user must retrans-
mit these stained data frames in the next slots. Thus, the service time
of a primary connection will be extended from Xp (slots/arrival) to X˜p
(slots/arrival). Furthermore, a secondary user cannot transmit data even
with an idle channel when a false alarm occurs. Hence, a secondary user
needs to spend more time to complete its connection transmission. Then, the
service time of a secondary connection will be extended to X˜s (slots/arrival)
from Xs (slots/arrival). Furthermore, power outage will extend the actual
service time to Zp (slots/arrival) and Zs (slots/arrival) from X˜p (slots/arrival)
and X˜s (slots/arrival), respectively. In the remaining part of this chapter,
we call X˜p and X˜s the actual service time of the primary and secondary
connections as well as Zp and Zs the actual service time of the primary and
184
channel utilization (denoted by U). Formally,
α∗ = argmax
0<α≤1
U(α) , (8.1)
subject to
Θp(α) ,
E[Zp(α)]
E[Xp]
≤ Θmax , (8.2)
and
E[Ss(α)] ≤ Smax , (8.3)
where E[·] is the expectation function and Ss(α) is the average overall system
time of the secondary connections, which is defined as the duration from the
instant that data arrives at system until the instant of finishing the whole
transmission. Note that from queueing theory, it follows that
U(α) = λpE[Xp] + αλsE[Xs] . (8.4)
From (8.4), we can found that U(α) is a strictly increasing function of α.
Hence, our optimization problem can be solved by maximizing α while main-
taining the constraints (8.2) and (8.3).
In the Utilization Maximization Problem, (8.2) and (8.3) represent
the interference and latency constraints of the primary and secondary con-
nections in the application layer, respectively. Obviously, U , E[Zp] and E[Ss]
are related to not only α in the MAC layer and traffic statistics of the pri-
mary and secondary users in the application layer but also missed detection
probability PM , false alarm probability PF , outage probability pip for the pri-
mary users, and outage probability pis for the secondary users in the physical
layer. To solve this optimization problem, we use the preemptive resume
priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing model to evaluate these unknown system
performance measures. We will detail this queueing mode in the following.
186
8.4 Analysis of Constraint Functions in the
Utilization Maximization Problem
This section show how to derive the closed-form expressions for E[Zp] and
E[Ss] in (8.2) and (8.3).
8.4.1 Analysis of Actual Service Time of the Primary
Connection in the Physical Channel
Effect of Missed Detection
Basically, missed detections in CR networks can be categorized into two
kinds [64, 66]. Firstly, when a primary user is transmitting data, a newly
arriving secondary connection may incorrectly assess that this specific chan-
nel is available in its first sensing phase. In this case, the class-A missed
detection occurs. Next, a secondary user may also fail to detect the presence
of primary users after it arrives at a CR network for a while. This situation
is called the class-B missed detection. The authors in [64, 66] found that
the class-B missed detection is small because the sensing results at the first
sensing phase can be employed to improve the accuracy of the sensing results
at the following sensing phases.
Next, we explain the effect of class-A missed detection on the actual
service time of the primary connections. We consider a transmission slot
of this primary connection. During this slot, more than one arrival of the
secondary connection appears with probability 1−e−λs∆, where ∆ is the slot
duration. For these arrivals of secondary connections, each of them will assess
this busy slot as idle if and only if (1) a missed detection occurs and (2) the
low-priority queue of the considered channel is empty. Let Qs be the length
188
Effect of Power Outage
When outage occurs, the users must retransmit the failed slot. Hence, the
actual transmission time of the primary connections in the physical channel
will be extended from X˜p to Zp. The first and the second moments of Zp can
be expressed as follows:
E[Zp] =
∞∑
x˜=1
E[(Zp)|X˜p = x˜]Pr(X˜p = x˜) , (8.8)
and
E[(Zp)
2] =
∞∑
x˜=1
E[(Zp)
2|X˜p = x˜]Pr(X˜p = x˜) . (8.9)
When outage occurs, the failed slots must be retransmitted in the next
slot. Hence, for a connection with transmission duration x˜, its actual service
time Zp in the physical channel will be extended to z+i if and only if outages
occur in i slots of the first x˜ + i − 1 slots and outage does not occur at the
(z + i)th slot. Hence, the conditional expectation of the actual service time
in the physical channel follows the negative binomial distribution. That is,
E[Zp|X˜p = x˜] =
∞∑
i=0
(x˜+ i)
(
x˜+ i− 1
i
)
(1− pip)x˜piip , (8.10)
and
E[Z2p |X˜p = x˜] =
∞∑
i=0
(x˜+ i)2
(
x˜+ i− 1
i
)
(1− pip)x˜piip . (8.11)
where pip is the outage probability for the primary connections.
Finally, when Pr(X˜p = x˜) is given, we can obtain E[Zp] and E[(Zp)
2] by
substituting (8.10) into (8.8) and (8.11) into (8.9), respectively. Note that
how to derive Pr(X˜p = x) from fp(x) has been discussed in Appendix D.
For example, if fp(x) is the geometric distribution, i.e.,
fp(x) = (1− 1
E[Xp]
)x−1(
1
E[Xp]
) , (8.12)
190
phenomenons will extend the overall system time. In the following subsec-
tions, we will investigate the effects of waiting time due to channel contention,
multiple handoffs, false alarm probability PF , and outage probability pis on
E[Ss].
Effect of Waiting Time Due to Multiple Secondary Users’ Con-
tention
When a secondary connection arrives at system, it cannot be transmitted
immediately until all the secondary connections in the low-priority queue
and the primary connections in the high-priority queue have been served.
Hence, when more secondary users access channel, waiting time will increase.
Referring to [135], the average waiting time can be expressed as follows:
E[W ] =
1
2
λpE[(Zp)
2] + 1
2
αλsE[(Zs)
2]
(1− λpE[Zp]− αλsE[Zs])(1− λpE[Zp]) . (8.16)
Effects of Multiple Handoffs
The extended data delivery time of each secondary connection consists of
the actual service time Zs in the physical channel and the cumulative delay
resulting from multiple handoffs. Let N and D be the number of interrup-
tions for the secondary connection and the handoff delay for each spectrum
handoff. Then, we have
E[T ] = E[Zs] + E[N ]E[D] . (8.17)
Referring to [135], it follows that
E[D] =
E[Zp]
1− λpE[Zp] , (8.18)
and
E[N ] = λpE[Zs] . (8.19)
192
8.5 Numerical Results
In this section, we show the impacts of different system parameters on Θp,
E[Ss], and α
∗. We consider the following system parameters: λp = 0.02 and
pip = pis = 0.1. Furthermore, because this report focuses on the latency-
sensitive traffic, we can assume that the service time Xp and Xs of the
primary and secondary connections follow the geometric distributions (see
page 135 in [142]). Note that we only use the geometric distribution as an
example here. Indeed, the proposed analytical framework can be applied to
any distributions. It only requires the knowledge of the first and the second
moments of the data transmission time distributions for the primary and the
secondary connections.
Figure 8.1 compares the interference ratio (Θp) for various traffic admis-
sion probabilities (α). Obviously, Θp increases as the arrival rate (λs) of the
secondary connections increases. Furthermore, because a larger α will lead
to much more traffic loads of the secondary connections, the primary con-
nections will be stained with a larger probability. Based on the analytical
results, we can design an admission control rule to satisfy the interference
constraint on the primary connections. For example, we consider λs = 0.019
and Θmax = 1.1175. In this case, when admission control had not imple-
mented (i.e. α = 1), the interference ratio is 1.1325, which is larger than
Θmax. In order to satisfy the interference constraint, we must lower the
effective traffic loads of the secondary connections by setting α = 0.3.
The effects of the traffic admission probability α and the arrival rate
λs of the secondary connections on the average overall system time (E[Ss])
of the secondary connections in shown in Fig 8.2. We can found that the
average overall system time increases as α or λs increases. Similarly, we
can also develop the admission control rule for the arriving secondary users

subject to their latency requirement. For example, we consider λs = 0.016
and Smax = 63. If we do not use admission control mechanism, the average
overall system time is 86, which is larger than Smax. Hence, a part of traffic
workloads of the secondary users must be rejected in order to satisfy the
delay constraint for the secondary users. In the considered case, we must set
α = 0.3.
The optimal traffic admission probability for various arrival rates of the
secondary connections is shown in Fig. 8.3. This figure shows that α∗ de-
creases as λs increases because a larger λs implies much more interference
and channel contention. Furthermore, a higher PF will lead to longer ex-

Latency Analysis for Spectrum
Sharing
Cognitive radio (CR) aims to improve spectrum efficiency by allowing the
secondary users to temporally utilize the unused licensed spectrum by the
dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technique. There are many important chal-
lenges needed to be overcome to achieve the objective of DSS. One of key
challenges is the fact that the secondary users can only borrow the licensed
spectrum from the primary users for a short period of time, and will lose the
channel access privilege when the primary user appears. Hence, unlike many
available multi-channel MAC protocols for ad hoc networks where through-
put is the main performance issue, the MAC protocols for CR networks shall
place more emphases on the access latency. Access latency to the borrowed
licensed spectrum for the secondary users should be minimized because the
primary user may appear to take back its spectrum any time.
In this chapter, we propose an analytical approach to evaluate the latency
performance of MAC protocols in CR networks with the dedicated and the
embedded control channels. The key ingredient of the analytical approach is
198
control channels in order to minimize the access delay of MAC protocol in
CR networks?
9.2 Problem Formulation
In this chapter, we focus on analyzing the CR MAC with dedicated and
embedded control channels. For dedicated control channel case, it has control
channel saturation and data channel saturation problems. For embedded
control channel, it has channel mismatch problem.
In [164], the authors finds that minimizing the per packet delay may not
minimize the total packets delay. From Fig. 9.1 and assume there are four
packets in the network, one can see that the total packets delay is smaller
than four times of the per packet delay. Thus, in this paper, we consider not
only the per packet delay but also the total packets delay. The goal of this
chapter is to evaluate the per packet and total packets delay by modeling the
control and data channel saturation problems in dedicated case and channel
mismatch problem in embedded case.
9.2.1 Saturation Problem with Dedicated Control Chan-
nel
In [165], the authors showed that splitting the total channel bandwidth leads
to the control channel saturation issue, thereby degrading the throughput
due to the overlong contention duration. Let Tdata be the data transmission
duration, Tc the sum of the contention duration and the control frames trans-
mission duration. When
∑n
i=1 Tdata∑n−1
i=1 Tc
< 1, the control channel saturation issue
occurs, as shown in Fig. 9.4.
One way to mitigate the control channel saturation is to increase the
200
control channel bandwidth. If the control channel bandwidth increases too
much, i.e.,
∑n
i=1 Tdata∑n−1
i=1 Tc
> 1, the data channel saturation issue occurs as shown
in Fig. 9.5. In practice, it is hard to adjust the optimal control channel
bandwidth for with varying data lengths and contention durations.
9.2.2 Problems with Embedded Control Channel
Mismatched Problem
In Fig. 9.2, we illustrate the channel mismatched problem using the embed-
ded control channel.
1. At T1 - SU 2 doesn’t have data to transmit and its default channel CH
3 is busy. Thus, SU 2 switches to the idle channel. However, CH 1 and
CH 2 are still busy until T1. If SU 1 has data to transmit at T1, SU
1 switches to CH 1 because it has the longest idle period. However, if
SU 2 switches to CH 2, then SU 1 and SU 2 can’t exchange data on
the same spectrum. We call it the channel mismatched problem.
2. At T2 - SU 1 transmits RTS and waits for the CTS.
3. At T3 - After waiting for a period of RTS timeout and doesn’t receive
the CTS, transmitter guesses that SU 2 is not in CH 1. Then, SU 1
switches to the second longest idle period CH 2. Receiver SU 2 finds
CH 2 is still idle. Thus, SU 2 stays on CH 2. Thus, SU 1 and SU 2 can
transmit data on the same spectrum.
4. At T4 - SU 1 receives a CTS from SU 2. Thus, SU 1 knows that SU 2
is on CH 2. Then, SU 1 can transmit data to SU 2 on CH 2.
202
be a transmitter is another issue. To solve this problem, SU 1 should go back
to SU 2’s default channel when CH 3 becomes idle (this timer can be known
from NAV). After that, SU 1 should go back to its default channel when SU
1 transmits to SU 2 successfully.
9.2.3 Definition of Access Delay for CR MAC with
Dedicated and Embedded Control Channels
Our goal is to evaluate and minimize the access delay for CR MAC with
dedicated and embedded control channels as follows. As to dedicated control
channel case, the delay E[D] with considering the control channel and data
channel saturation problems:
E[D] = PcsE[D|the kth packet with control channel saturation]
+ PdsE[D|the kth packet with data channel saturation] .
(9.1)
where Pcs and Pds are the saturation probabilities of the control and data
channels, respectively.
As to embedded control channel case, the delay E[D′] with considering
the channel mismatch problems:
E[D′] = E[T ]E[N ] , (9.2)
9.2.4 System Model and Assumptions
Now, we introduce the system model that we use to evaluate the access
delay. Figure 9.3 shows a system model for CR networks, where there are
204
The rest of this chapter are organized as follows. Section 3.1 analyzes the
per packet dynamic access latency for cognitive radio medium access control
protocol with dedicated and embedded control channels. In Section 3.2, we
analyze the total packets dynamic access latency for cognitive radio medium
access control protocol with dedicated and embedded control channels.
9.3.1 Per Packet Latency Analysis
In this section, we analyze the average delay of dynamic spectrum access
for the CR MAC protocols with dedicated and embedded control channels
as described in Chapter 2. The per packet access delay is defined as the
duration starting from the instance that an RTS packet is at the head of
the queue and starts to content for the transmission until the instance that
the associated acknowledgment (ACK) packet for a data packet is received.
The total packets access delay is defined as the total deliver time to send
total number packets. It is assumed that each CR node always has packets
to transmit. In the case of low traffic load, the dedicated case may be better
than the embedded. However, in the case of full load, whether the dedicated
control channel is still better than embedded control channel is unknown.
Thus, we perform the worst case study to compare the dedicated control
channel and the embedded control channels. It is assumed that the channel
switching time is zero.
Case I : Dedicated Control Channel
Now we discuss how to calculate the average delay of dynamic spectrum
access for the CR MAC protocols with dedicated control channel. Let Pcs
and Pds be the saturation probabilities of the control and data channels,
respectively, both of which can be obtained from Fig. 9.9 for a given ratio
206
Figure 9.4: The access delay under the control channel saturation (T1=T2)
208
Substituting (9.5)-(9.10) into (9.4) for a given value of E[Tdata], one can ob-
tain the average access delay conditional on the occurrence of control channel
saturation.
(2) Delay With Data Channel Saturation: Referring to Fig. 9.5, we
discuss how to calculate the access delay with data channel saturation. In the
figure, there are three possible events in the control channel: idle, successful
transmission, and collision. Assume that a node waits for a duration of
(E[T ]E[N (c)]+ts) before successfully transmitting a control frame, where T is
the virtual slot duration; N (c) is the number of virtual slots; and ts is defined
in (9.8). Specifically, (E[T ]E[N (c)] + ts) is the duration starting from the
beginning of channel contention until the first data frame transmission. Next,
this particular user will need further wait for a duration of (N (d)−1)E[Tdata]
before transmitting its own data frame, where N (d) is the average number
of transmitted data frames of other users and this user and E[Tdata] is the
average duration of a data frame. Thus, the average access delay with data
channel saturation (denoted by E[D|data channel saturation occurs]) can be
expressed as
E[D|the kth packet with data channel saturation]
=
(
E[T ]E[N (c)] + ts
)
+ E[Tdata]E[N
(d)] . (9.11)
Note that (9.11) means a particular node sends out its data packets at kth
order and previous k-1 packets may suffer from control or data channel sat-
uration problems.
In the case when no node successfully transmits a control frame, only two
events possibly occur at each virtual slot. The first one is an empty slot with
the probability of 1−Ptr
1−PsPtr ; the second one is a collided transmission with the
probability of (1−Ps)Ptr
1−PsPtr . Hence, the average duration of a virtual slot T in
210
this case can be written as
E[T ] =
1− Ptr
1− PsPtrσ +
(1− Ps)Ptr
1− PsPtr tf . (9.12)
Moreover, given the probability without successful transmissions 1 − PsPtr,
the probability that the number of virtual slots N (c) = k + 1 in the control
channel until the first data frame transmission is equal to (1− PsPtr)kPsPtr.
Hence, it is followed that the average number of virtual slots N (c)
E[N (c)] =
∞∑
k=0
(k + 1)(1− PsPtr)kPsPtr
=
1
PsPtr
. (9.13)
To calculate E[N (d)], it is assumed that a particular user successfully
sends a control frame at the first time with k− 1 previous transmitting data
frames. The probability Ps(k) that the first data frame of this user as the
k − th data frames in the data channel can be expressed as follows
Ps(k) =
(
1
n
)(
1− 1
n
)k−1
. (9.14)
Then, the average total number E[N (d)] of data frames in the data channel
including this user’s frame is equal to
E[N (d)] =
∞∑
k=1
k
(
1
n
)(
1− 1
n
)k−1
. (9.15)
Substituting (9.8), (9.12), (9.13) and (9.15) into (9.11) for a given value
of E[Tdata], one can obtain the conditional average access delay given the
occurrence of data channel saturation.
Case II : Embedded Control Channel
Now we consider the access delay D′ for CR MAC with embedded control
channel. When considering a CR MAC with embedded control channels,
212
and
Pmismatch =
m− 1
m
. (9.20)
Recall that the probability with an empty slot is 1−Ptr, and the probability
with collided transmission is (1 − Ps)Ptr. When considering all the four
possible events at each virtual slot, the average virtual time slot duration
E[T ] can be expressed as
E[T ] = (1− Ptr)σ + (1− Ps)Ptrtf
+ PmatchPsPtrtmatch
+ PmismatchPsPtrtmisatch , (9.21)
where Tmismatch, Tmatch, Pmatch, and Pmismatch are given by (9.17), (9.18),
(9.19), and (9.20), respectively.
Now, we calculate E[N ] in (9.27). Consider m candidate channels. With
previous k− 1 mismatched events, the probability of the two CR users select
the same channel in the k − th attempt is equal to
m− 1
m
· m− 2
m− 1 . . .
m− k + 1
m− k + 2 ·
1
m− k + 1 =
1
m
. (9.22)
Before a CR node transmits RTS, it needs to wait for a contention du-
ration. The number of virtual slots before the successful transmission of an
RTS frame can be denoted by N (c) as shown in (9.10). With previous k − 1
mismatched events, this node will undergo kE[N (c)] virtual slots on average.
The probability of the occurrence of the first matched event in k events is
1/m according to (9.22). Thus, E[N ] can be expressed as
E[N ] =
m∑
k=1

Substituting (9.21) and (9.23) into (9.27) for a given value of E[Tdata], one
can obtain the average access delay for embedded control channel .

tion. We consider the whole packets delay of whole c packets as shown in
Fig. 9.7. Firstly, the system wait a duration of the first user’s control frame
transmission time equals to (E[T ]E[N (c)]ts). Because the data channel satu-
ration occurs, we will calculate the latency resulted from c data frames rather
than that resulted from control frames. Because there are c data frames need
to be transmitted, we can express the conditional whole packets access delay
given that the data channel saturation occurs as follows:
E[Doverall|the last packet with data channel saturation]
= cE[Tdata] + (E[T ]E[N
(c)]ts) , (9.26)
where c is the whole number of packets in the network and (E[T ]E[N (c)]+ts)
can be obtained from (9.12), (9.13), (9.8) and (9.9).
Substituting (9.8), (9.9), (9.12) and (9.13) into (9.26) for a given value of
E[Tdata] and c, one can obtain the conditional whole packets delay given the
event that data channel saturation occurs.
Case II : Embedded Control Channel
Now we consider the whole packets access delay D′overall for CR MAC with
embedded control channel. When considering a CR MAC with embedded
control channels, control channels and data channels use the same frequency
spectrum and are not split into two portions in the frequency domain. Thus,
from the average viewpoint, the whole packets can be seen that distribute
uniformly on the whole number of channels (we denote this number as m).
Then, we calculate the average time duration to send a complete control
frames and a data frame that equal to E[T ′]E[N (c)]t′s. From Fig. 9.8, one can
express the average whole packets access delay for CR MAC with embedded

Substituting (9.29), (9.30), (9.28) and (9.13) into (9.27) for a given value
of whole packet numbers c, one can obtain the conditional whole packets
delay for CR MAC with embedded control channel.
9.4 Numerical Results
In this section, we first show the relation between the delay of dedicated
control channel and the control channel bandwidth ratio. Then we compare
the per packet and total packets access delay performance of the dedicated
control channel and embedded control channel for various user numbers and
data sizes. As to the analytical result of the total packets delay, we use 2000
packets to simulate the total packets delay. The related system parameters
are listed in Table 9.1. The basic transmission rate is used in each control
channel. The data rate is used in each channel for embedded case. In our
simulation, it is assumed that data length and the contention period are
exponential distribution [168].

channel saturation probability

MAC with dedicated control channel only for the case of 17 users. Neverthe-
less, the optimal control bandwidth ratios for the dedicated control channels
varies for different data sizes and contention periods. Thus, it may be hard
to trace the optimal bandwidth ratio dynamically.
Effect of Number of Users and Data Lengths on Confidence Interval
Comparison of Access Latency
Because the confidence interval can jointly consider the mean and standard
deviation, we use confidence interval to compare these two control channel
methods.
First, Figure 9.12 shows the confidence interval (90 percent confidence)
of the per packet access latency for CR MAC with dedicated and embedded
224

cated and embedded control channels under small data length

control channels under small data length
dedicated and embedded control channels under large packet length (2000
bytes). It shows that the per packet access delay of the CR MAC with ded-
icated control channel is shorter than the CR MAC with embedded control
when user numbers is large (23 users).
9.4.3 Total Packets Access Latency
Effect of Number of Users on Access Latency
Figure 9.16 shows the effect of different number of users on the total packets
delay of the CR MAC with dedicated and embedded control channels. This
figure shows that the total packets latency of dedicated case is higher than
that of embedded case when the user numbers is not large(under 18 users).

cated and embedded control channels under small data length
232
Figure 9.19: Total packets access latency for CR MAC with dedicated and
embedded control channels under small data length
First, Figure 9.19 shows the total packets access latency for CR MAC
with dedicated and embedded control channels under small packet length
(300 bytes). It shows that the total packets access delay of the dedicated
case is longer than the embedded case when the average data length is small.
Then, Figure 9.20 shows the total packets access latency for CR MAC
with dedicated and embedded control channels under large packet length
(2000 bytes). It shows that the total packet access delay of the CR MAC
with dedicated control channel is shorter than the CR MAC with embedded
control when user numbers is large (over 17 users).
Hence, from the standpoint of access latency, we find that the legacy
IEEE 802.11 CSMA/CA MAC protocol is worth extending to CR MAC
by adding the channel search capability under some system characteristics.
234
We can conclude that DSA protocol in CR networks can dedicate a certain
portion of spectrum for sending control frames if user numbers is large (i.e.,
25 users or higher than 1.13 times of the typical 15-user case); otherwise,
the embedded control channel shall be considered. Furthermore, from total
packets delay viewpoint, when the data length is small (i.e., 300 bytes or
lower than 0.29 times of the typical 1024-byte case), the embedded control
channel method is suggested to be used even though the user numbers is
large.
236
• Based on the CSMA/CA MAC protocol, a physical/MAC cross-layer
analytical model is developed to compute the coexistence probability
of a peer-to-peer connection and an infrastructure-based connection.
Based on this analytical model, we find that concurrent transmission
of the secondary CR users and the primary users in the legacy system
can significantly enhance the total throughput over the pure legacy
system.
10.1 Motivation
In the literature, the coexistence issue of the hybrid infrastructure-based and
overlaying ad hoc networks has been addressed but in different scenarios.
In [169–172], the idea of combining ad hoc link and infrastructure-based link
was proposed mainly to extend the coverage area of the infrastructure-based
network. That is, the coverage area of ad hoc networks is not overlapped
with that of the infrastructure-based network. In the present hybrid ad
hoc/infrastructure-based network, as shown in Fig. 10.1, the peer-to-peer
CR users are located within the coverage area of the existing legacy wireless
network. In [173], to further improve the throughput of a wireless local
area network (WLAN), it was suggested that an access point (AP) could
dynamically switch between the infrastructure mode and the ad hoc mode.
In our considered scenario, the decision of establishing ad hoc connections is
made by the CR users in a distributed manner.
238
10.2 System Model
In this section, we define the generic system model discussed in this report.
Figure 10.1 illustrates a hybrid ad hoc/infrastructure-based network consist-
ing of two CR devices (MS1 and MS2) and a primary user MS3. Assume that
the secondary CR users MS1 and MS2 try to make a peer-to-peer connection,
and the primary user MS3 has been connected to the base station (BS) or
access point (AP) of the legacy infrastructure-based system. In the figure,
MS1, MS2 and MS3 are located at (r1, θ1), (r2, θ2) and (r3, θ3), respectively;
the coverage area of the base station is piR2. All the primary and secondary
users stay fixed or hardly move.
We assume the CR devices can perform the positioning technique to ac-
quire their relative or absolute position by using GPS or detecting the signal
strength from the BSs of legacy systems [174–179]. The location information
is broadcasted by using the geographical routing protocols [180–182]. Al-
though both the positioning and geographical routing may waste time and
consume the energy, they have no need to be processed for every data trans-
mission. They are only performed when a new node joins or the node changes
its position. Furthermore, with the help of upper layer, the location infor-
mation is already stored in the device. Therefore, compared to the spectrum
sensing at every transmission, we believe the additional energy consumption
and memory space due to the positioning and location update is relatively
small. The overhead and optimal reserved resources for acquiring the loca-
tion information are beyond the scope of this paper and have been studied
in some research works [183,184].
Based on the CSMA/CA MAC protocol, multiple users contend the chan-
nel, and only one mobile station within the coverage of the base station can
establish an infrastructure-based communication link at any instant. To set

10.3 Signal-to-Interference Ratio Analysis
10.3.1 Uplink SIR Analysis
In the uplink case when the primary user MS3 transmits data to the base
station, denote SIR
(u)
i as the uplink SIR of MS3 and let P30 and P10 be the
received power from MS3 and MS1 at the base station, respectively. Then
from (10.2), we have
SIR
(u)
i = (
r1
r3
)α =
P30
P10
, (10.3)
where r1 and r3 are the distances between MS1 and MS3 to the base station,
respectively. Similarly, the SIR of a peer-to-peer ad hoc link from MS1 to
MS2 can be written as
SIRa =
P12
P32
= (
d23
d12
)α , (10.4)
where P12 is the received power at MS2 from MS1 and P32 is the interfer-
ence power from MS3; d12 and d23 are the distances from MS1 and MS3 to
MS2, respectively. Substituting (10.3) and (10.4) into (10.1), the concurrent
transmission probability P
(u)
CT in the uplink case can be written as
P
(u)
CT = P{(r3z1/αi < r1 < R) ∩ (d12 <
d23
za1/α
)} , R
(u)
CT
piR2
. (10.5)
Note that R
(u)
CT denotes the concurrent transmission region where MS1 can
connect to MS2 without interfering the uplink signal of MS3 to the base
station. As shown in Fig. 10.2, the condition (r3z
1/α
i < r1 < R) leads to
a donut-shaped area consisting of two circles centered at the base station
with the radii of r3z
1/α
i and R, respectively. Meanwhile, the condition (d12 <
d23/z
1/α
a ) yields the circular area centering at MS2 with a radius of d23/z
1/α
a .
From the figure, the region R
(u)
CT can be computed as

CT = pi(

downlink direction. Then from (10.2), we have
SIR
(d)
i =
P03
P13
= (
hbs
hms
)2(
d13
r3
)α , (10.9)
where P03 and P13 are the MS3’s received powers from the base station and
MS1, respectively; d13 stands for the distance from MS1 to MS3; hbs, hms and
r3 are given in (10.2) and (10.3). Similarly, the ad hoc link’s SIR from MS1
to MS2 can be expressed as
SIRa =
P12
P02
= (
hms
hbs
)2(
r2
d12
)α , (10.10)
where P12 and P02 are the received powers at MS2 from MS1 and the base
station, respectively; r2 represents the distance between MS2 and the base
station; d12, hbs and hms are defined in (10.4) and (10.2).
Substituting (10.9) and (10.10) into (10.1), we can obtain the concurrent
transmission probability P
(d)
CT of a CR-based peer-to-peer ad hoc link and an
infrastructure-based downlink transmission as follows:
P
(d)
CT = P{(d13 > r3z′1/αi ) ∩ (d12 < r2z′1/αa ) ∩ (r1 < R)} ,
R

where z′i = zih

a = 1/za · h2ms/h2bs. From (10.11), the concurrent
transmission region R
(d)
CT in the downlink case is shown in Fig. 10.3. The
criterion (d13 > r3z
′1/α
i ) results in the region outside the circle centered at
MS3 with a radius of r3z
′1/α
i , while the criterion (d12 < r2z
′1/α
a ) yields the
region inside the circle centered at MS2 with radius r2z
′1/α
a . At last, r1 < R
because MS1 is assumed to be uniformly distributed within a cell of radius
R.
The coexistence probability of the CR-based ad hoc link and the infrastructure-
based downlink can be obtained by calculating the area of R

and H, respectively.
10.3.3 Multiple Ad Hoc Connections Coexisting with
One Infrastructure Link
After evaluating the concurrent transmission probability of the infrastructure
link and the one overlaying CR-based ad hoc link, one may be interested in
knowing how many secondary users can concurrently establish ad hoc links
together with the primary user. This question is non-trivial since it needs to
consider the interference from a set of ad hoc links to the infrastructure link,
and vice versa. Besides, different from the pure infrastructure network, both
the locations of the transmitter and receiver in an ad hoc link are random.
Instead of calculating the maximum number of ad hoc links, we suggest
constructive procedures enabling CR devices to establish ad hoc links in
the presence of an infrastructure transmission. The detailed procedures are
summarized as follows:
1. Consider a network in which all the primary and secondary users are
fixed, and the CR device can learn the locations of its receiver and
neighbors by the routing mechanism [15]. Here, we assume that l ad
246
hoc links have been established and coexisted with the infrastructure
link at the same time. Before establishing a new ad hoc connection,
the CR device has to overhear the channel and memorizes the locations
of all the existing transmitters.
2. With the location information, the new CR device starts evaluating
the concurrent transmission region RCT . The device should consider
the interference from the infrastructure link as well as other existing
ad hoc links, and vice versa. Denote the indices {p,m, n, k} as the
primary user, the transmitter and receiver of the new ad hoc link, and
the transmitter of other existing ad hoc link, respectively. Using similar
procedures in deriving (10.5), the three conditions in the infrastructure
uplink case can be written by
rm ≥ ( 11
zi
( 1
rp
)α −∑k( 1rk )α ) 1α ; (10.22)
dmn ≤ ( 1
za((
1
dpn
)α +
∑
k(
1
dkn
)α)
)
1
α ; (10.23)
rm ≤ R , (10.24)
where ri and dij are the distances between the base station and CR
device j to i, respectively. Similarly, from (10.11), the three criteria in
the downlink case are
dmp ≥ ( 11
zi
( 1
rp
)α −∑k( 1dkp )α ) 1α ; (10.25)
dmj ≤ ( 1
za((
1
rn
)α +
∑
k(
1
dkn
)α)
)
1
α ; (10.26)
rm ≤ R . (10.27)
3. Since the concurrent transmission regions R
(u)
CT and R
(d)
CT are known, the
CR device can determine whether it can concurrently transmit data
248
SIR(d)a (ξ12, ξ02) =
10
ξ12
10 /dα12
10
ξ02
10 /rα2
. (10.31)
Note that the index 0 represents the base station and ξ30 of (10.29) in the
uplink case is equivalent to ξ03 of (10.31) in the downlink case. Let ξ =
(ξ10, ξ30, ξ12, ξ32) and ξ
′ = (ξ13, ξ03, ξ12, ξ02) and assume that these shadowing
components are identical and independently distributed. Taking shadowing
into account, the concurrent transmission probability PCT can be represented
by
• uplink case:
P
(u)
CT (ξ) = P{(r3(zi10
ξ10−ξ30
10 )1/α < r1 < R) ∩ (d12 < d23(za10
ξ12−ξ32
10 )1/α)} ;
(10.32)
• downlink case:
P
(d)
CT (ξ
′) = P{(d13 > r3(zi10
ξ13−ξ03
10 )1/α) ∩ (d12 < r2(za10
ξ12−ξ02
10 )1/α)
∩(r1 < R)} . (10.33)
We define the reliability of uplink concurrent transmission F
(u)
CT (ξ) as the
probability that, in the region RCT , a CR device can successfully establish an
ad hoc link in the presence of the primary user’s uplink transmission subject
to the shadowing effect. That is,
F
(u)
CT (ξ) = P{(SIR(ui (ξ30, ξ10) > zi) ∩ (SIR(u)a (ξ12, ξ32) > z)|MS1 ∈ R(u)CT} .(10.34)
Note that F
(u)
CT (ξ) = 1 when shadowing is not considered. Substituting
(10.28) and (10.29) into (10.34), we can obtain
F
(u)
CT (ξ) = P{(ξ30−ξ10>10 log10(zi(
r3
r1
)α))∩(ξ12−ξ32>10 log10(za(
d12
d23
)α))
|MS1∈R(u)CT} . (10.35)
250
this constraint, we use the location and channel station information to re-
place the RSS measurement for CCA in the traditional CSMA/CA MAC
protocol. Therefore, the CR device can establish the ad hoc connection once
the new connection does not injure the existing primary infrastructure link.
Next, we first summarize the throughput calculation in the traditional
CSMA/CA MAC protocol [187, 188]. Assume N stations always transmit
data packets in the network, and let W and 2bW be the minimum and max-
imum backoff window sizes, respectively. Given the stationary transmission
probability τ that a station transmits packet in a given slot and the success-
ful transmission probability ps(N), the throughput S(N) of the CSMA/CA
MAC protocol can be expressed as
S(N) =
ptrps(N)E[P ]
(1− ptr)σ + ptr(1− ps(N))Tc + ptrps(N)Tc , (10.38)
where ptr = 1−(1−τ)N ; E[P], Ts, Tc, and σ are the average payload size, the
average successful transmission duration, the average collision duration, and
the slot duration. The stationary transmission probability τ is a function of
the packet loss probability pL, that is
τ(pL) =
2
1 +W + pLW
b−1∑
i=0
(2pL)i
. (10.39)
Note that both the packet loss probability pL and the successful transmission
probability ps(N) are influenced by the radio channel effect and the multiuser
capture effect in the physical layer [188].
Then, we evaluate the total throughput performance of the concurrent
transmission in the hybrid infrastructure and overlaying CR-based ad hoc
network. Here, we assume NCR CR devices and N non-CR devices using
the same frequency band in the coverage of a base station. Since the CR
device can establish an ad hoc connection without interfering the existing

agrees well with that in the simulation. The other system parameters are
listed in Table I.

an optimal concurrent transmission probability P

sion probability is higher than that of the downlink’s. For zi = za = 0 dB
and r2 = 100 meters, P
(u)
CT = 49% and P
(d)
CT = 39%, respectively. This is
because in the considered scenario the interference to the ad hoc user from
the infrastructure-based uplink transmission is weaker than that from the
downlink transmission.
10.6.3 Effects of Shadowing on the Concurrent Trans-
mission
Figures 10.8(a) and (b) illustrate the reliability of the concurrent transmis-
sions with various shadowing standard deviations versus r3 and r2, respec-
tively. In general, comparing σξ = 6 dB and σξ = 1 dB, one can find that
the larger shadowing variance leads to a lower reliability for both uplink and
downlink concurrent transmissions. For example, in Fig. 10.8(a), when the
primary user’s distance to the base station r3 in the range of 0 ∼ 100 me-
ters, F
(d)
CT is larger than 0.9 for σξ = 1 dB, whereas it decreases to 0.6 ∼ 0.7
for σξ = 6 dB. However, when the primary user moves to the cell edge, the
reliability of uplink and downlink concurrent transmissions decreases due to
shadowing and weaker received signal strength. As shown in Fig. 10.8(a), for
σξ = 6 dB, F
(d)
CT and F
(u)
CT decrease from 0.7 to 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. Since
the uplink signal strength is weaker than the downlink signal, the reliability of
uplink concurrent transmission is usually more sensitive to shadowing effects
than downlink concurrent transmission, especially when the primary user is
at the cell edge. In Fig. 10.8(b), it is shown that, subject to the influence of
shadowing, the reliability of uplink and downlink concurrent transmissions
increases when the receiver MS2 of the ad hoc link approaches to the cell
edge. For σξ = 1 dB, F

11.1 Motivation
According to [17–19], the main functionality of a cognitive MAC protocol,
as shown in Fig. 1.4, can be summarized as follows:
• observe stage - to sense the surrounding environment and record the
spectrum usage of the existing legacy systems;
• plan stage - to evaluate if a temporary ad hoc link can be established
without interfering current users;
• decide stage - to determine the transmit power, frequency, the time
and the duration of the frame transmission;
• act stage - to perform transmission with specified resources at the
scheduled time.
To achieve the aforementioned objectives, we design an enhanced CSMA/CA
MAC protocol for the spectrum access of secondary users. The CSMA/CA
MAC protocol has the preliminary function of spectrum avoidance to the
primary users. To start with, we examine the CSMA/CA MAC protocol by
referring the four stages of the cognition cycle in Fig. 1.4. First, from the
viewpoint of the observe stage, the cognitive MAC protocol is required to
record the spectrum usage of primary users and to collect the traffic char-
acteristics, such as the delay-sensitive or non-real-time data traffic. For the
CSMA/CA MAC protocol, most recent research results, instead of identify-
ing the interference, focus on either sensing the carrier transmission in the
surrounding environment or avoiding collisions [107–109]. Thus, the func-
tions of recording the spectrum usage and traffic characteristics are not fully
considered in the current CSMA/CA MAC protocols.
266
To synchronize the clock of each station, the methods designating a cen-
tralized controller to broadcast “beacon” signals or utilizing the global clock
provided by Global Positioning System (GPS) were suggested in [16,122,123].
However, both methods require additional devices.
Here, we propose such a generic cognitive MAC protocol in overlaying
ad hoc networks with emphases on achieving the aforementioned objectives:
high spectrum utilization, QoS satisfactory and short access delay. Specif-
ically, in the observe stage, we propose a mechanism of establishing the
neighbor list to help stations to recognize the spectrum opportunities. In
the plan stage, an improved contention resolution mechanism, consisting of
the gating mechanism, linear backoff algorithm and stall avoidance scheme,
is suggested to enhance the performance of throughput, access delay and
fairness from the aspect of short access delay for CR devices. In the decide
stage, a novel invited reservation procedure is developed to ensure a sec-
ondary user with QoS provisioning. At last, in the act stage, a distributed
frame synchronization mechanism is proposed to coordinate frame transmis-
sions among secondary users without a centralized controller.
11.2 Neighbor List Establishment in Observe
Stage
To have the knowledge of the spectrum usage by the existing legacy sys-
tem, we suggest a neighbor list establishment mechanism to record frame
transmissions from primary and secondary users in the observe stage of the
cognition cycle. Here, we assume the cognitive MAC protocol can cooper-
ate with other spectrum sensing, identification, and allocation mechanisms
to obtain the spectrum usage of primary users. Then, we partition the ob-
268
The RIT collects the reservation information in the MAC header of the
delay-sensitive data and its corresponding ACK frames for secondary
users. The header in the proposed MAC protocol is similar to that
in IEEE 802.11 WLAN [16], except for the duration field in the MAC
header for delay-sensitive data and its ACK frames. In our proposed
cognitive MAC protocol, the duration field represents the length of the
next delay-sensitive frame in the flow instead of the length of the cur-
rent frame as in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN. This duration field will be
set to zero if the delay-sensitive traffic flow has no remaining packets.
By overhearing the MAC header of frame transmissions in all the re-
served flows, CR devices can update its RIT and remove the canceled
flow from the list. In addition, the RIT can also use the received order
of the observed information for the sequence of reserved flow transmis-
sions. The transmission sequence and frame length incorporating with
the newly proposed distributed frame synchronization mechanism help
secondary users to recognize the time whether it can transmit packet
without interfering to the transmission of PU s and reserved frames,
which will be detailed in Section 11.5.
• Contention Information Table (CIT) records the properties of non-real-
time traffic including:
– the source address of the non-real-time data traffic flow.
– the transmission time of the observed frame;
– the number of non-real-time data traffic flows;
The CIT provides the information with the number of non-real-time
traffic flows, which will be used to reduce the collisions and improve
the channel throughput in the act stage of the cognition cycle.
270
unused spectrum in a short available transmission time. To this end, we
suggest three improved approaches as follows:
1. gating mechanism - to forbid the transmissions that may interfere to
primary users or collide with other CR users;
2. linear backoff algorithm - to expedite the link establishment of delay-
sensitive traffic flows;
3. stall avoidance scheme - to speed up the transmission of stalled non-
real-time data packets.
The three above mechanisms help to achieve the objectives of high through-
put, low access delay, and fairness for secondary users.
11.3.1 Gating Mechanism
The gating mechanism is used to avoid interfering the primary user of the
legacy system and to reduce the collision among CR users. The basic idea
is cooperating the spectrum usage information obtained from the spectrum
sensing, identification and allocation techniques to prevent from interfering
the primary users. Recall that the PIT stores the information of primary user
transmissions. The gating mechanism postpones the secondary user trans-
mitting packets when the primary user appears on the channel. In addition,
we also suggest the modified p-persistent CSMA algorithm to improve the
efficiency of spectrum usage for CR users, where the optimal value of p can
be computed according to the number of nrt-nodes in CIT [187].
The detailed procedure of the proposed gating mechanism is described as
follows:
272
the first frame of a delay-sensitive traffic flow is collided, the CW size (CWrt)
for that particular frame increases according to the following principle:
CWrt = min(CWmax, CWmin × (Nreq − 1)), (11.1)
where Nreq is the number of attempts for sending the frame; CWmax and
CWmin are the maximum and minimum CW sizes in the contention resolution
mechanism, respectively.
Figure 11.1 shows the CW sizes for the linear and binary exponential
backoff algorithms. As shown in the figure, the CW size in the linear backoff
algorithm increases less slowly than that in the binary exponential backoff
algorithm. Therefore, the channel access of the first frame in a delay-sensitive
traffic flow can be faster than that of the non-real-time data flows. As long
as the delay-sensitive traffic flow is successfully established, the remaining
frames are sent in the reserved time slot according to the proposed invited
reservation procedure (which will be discussed in Section 11.4). Based on our
design, because only the first frame contends for accessing the channel, the
number of attempts of establishing a delay-sensitive traffic flow is much fewer
than that of non-real-time traffic flows. Thus, the proposed MAC protocol
can avoid the collisions issue of the linear backoff algorithm, while reducing
the access delay in the link establishment of delay-sensitive traffic flows.
11.3.3 Stall Avoidance Scheme
In order to improve the fairness for the CR users, we develop a stall avoid-
ance scheme aiming to reduce the transmission delay of the nrt-nodes with
excessive buffered frames. The specific goal of the suggested approach is to
minimize the variance of the access delay among all the nrt-nodes. Due to the
short available transmission time of the spectrum in an overlaying cognitive
274
ad hoc network, the small variance of the access delay makes CR users have
equal opportunities to access the channel. Here, the access delay includes the
waiting time in the queue and the channel access time. Therefore, obviously,
reducing the variance of access delay implies to speed up the back-logged
frame transmission.
The suggested stall avoidance scheme with respect to nrt-nodes is de-
scribed as follows. Select a pre-determined threshold Qth for the maximum
allowable buffered data frames and the guaranteed CW size for the stalled
nrt-nodes CWstall, where
CWstall < CWmin. (11.2)
If the number of buffered frames in an nrt-node is more than Qth, the CW
size of the subsequent frames in the queue is reduced to CWstall. Because
a smaller CW size leads to a higher transmission probability, the lagging
frames in a stalled nrt-node with CWstall can be transmitted earlier than
others, thereby improving the fairness performance among nrt-nodes. Both
Qth and CWstall are system parameters, which optimal values can be obtained
through heuristic search but beyond the scope of this paper.
One may argue that reducing the CW size worsens the network congestion
in a crowded system and thus causes the instability for a network. However,
this situation may seldom happen because secondary users in a cognitive
network have plenty of channels, and the number of secondary users choose
and access on the same channel is small compared to the legacy system.
Furthermore, our simulation results shown in the later section illustrate that
the system up to 140 stations can still remain stable. Therefore, we believe
the system instability is not a severe problem for the proposed MAC protocol.

Furthermore, recall that the MAC duration field of delay-sensitive data and
its ACK frames represent the frame length of the next packet in the reserved
flow. This value will be set to zero if the reserved flow is cancelled, and thus
the receiver knows whether the sender has packets once the flow is estab-
lished. On the other hand, since the receiver can learn the spectrum usage
time of primary users in observe stage of the cognition cycle, the receiver al-
ways has the knowledge to adjust the invitation without interfering primary
users.
In our design, the transmission based on the reception of rt-CTS may in-
duce an issue that the transmission from the hidden node of the receiver may
cause collisions at the sender. In fact, assuming that the hidden node also
follows the proposed MAC protocol, it can transmit packets only after it re-
ceives all the data or ACK frames from all the reserved flows in RIT. In other
words, the hidden node has to wait for the end of all delay-sensitive frame
transmissions and then transmits packets accordingly. Therefore, we believe
the considered situation may not happen in our proposed MAC protocol.
278
of contentions, we design the linear backoff algorithm for the first packet
transmission to shorten the access delay. The linear backoff algorithm de-
creases the CW size of the collided frame to expedite the link establishment
of a delay-sensitive traffic flow. The simulation results in the later section
demonstrate that the dropping rate of delay-sensitive frames in the proposed
MAC protocol is almost negligible compared to that in the IEEE 802.11 DCF
mode. Therefore, we believe the impact of contentions to the link establish-
ment for delay-sensitive traffic is insignificant because most of packets are
reserved and sent during an acceptable period.
On the other hand, for a reservation based MAC protocol, one important
issue is the starvation problem for non-real-time data traffic. As shown in
Fig. 11.3, the fixed total transmission time in each round is partitioned into
two periods: the CFP and CP. To prevent the starvation problem, the time
duration of the two periods shall be appropriately allocated so that the delay
constraints for the delay-sensitive traffic flow can be satisfied, while its im-
pact on the non-real-time data transmission can be limited to an acceptable
level. However, precisely controlling the duration of CFP and CP in a dis-
tributed way is sophisticated for CR device. Instead, in this paper, the stall
avoidance scheme is designed to avoid the bandwidth suppression by expe-
diting the stalled frame transmission. Recall that the stall avoidance scheme
will decrease the CW size to CWstall if an nrt-node has excessive buffered
frames, and CWstall < CWmin. The stalled non-real-time data frame with
the small CW size CWstall can have a higher probability to win the chan-
nel contention and prohibits from rt-nodes establishing a new delay-sensitive
traffic flow. Therefore, in this way, the access delay of non-real-time data
frames can be still controlled within a reasonable range without sacrificing
the delay constraint for delay-sensitive traffic.
280
the information in RIT can be applied to identify the first and last stations
transmitting the delay-sensitive frames. Thus, when the channel is available,
the receiver of the first reserved flow in RIT broadcasts rt-CTS frame to
start a new CFP. During the CFP, the rt-nodes transmit frames based on
the sequence in RIT, whereas the nrt-nodes wait until receiving the ACK
frame from the receiver of the last flow in RIT. If the primary user become
active during CFP, the receiver of the delay-sensitive traffic flow will halt
sending the rt-CTS and resume it when the spectrum turns idle. Therefore,
through the information stored in PIT and RIT, all the CR users can access
the channel in the designated period without influencing the primary users
and the transmissions in the reserved time.
Figure 11.4 illustrates an example for the proposed distributed synchro-
nization mechanism. Assume that STAs 1∼6 establish delay-sensitive traffic
flows. At the start of the nth CFP, when STA 1 senses the channel is avail-
able, it immediately sends rt-CTS to start a new CFP and waits for receiving
the frame from STA 2. After sending the ACK frame to STA 2, STA 1 waits
for a fixed duration and repeats the above procedure until flow 1 is termi-
nated. In the meanwhile, STAs 3 and 5 overhear the channel and recognize a
new CFP. When the previous reserved transmissions are finished, STA 3 send
rt-CTS to STA 4 to start flow 2. At last, when the transmissions of the last
flow in RIT are ended, i.e., flow 3 from STA 6 to STA5, the CP in the nth
round starts. All the nrt-nodes are allowed to contend for the channel during
this duration until the next CFP starts. Note that the proposed distributed
frame synchronization is only needed when delay-sensitive traffic flows exit.
The legacy CSMA/CA MAC protocol with the suggested gating mechanism
is enough when only non-real-time traffic exists.
Three interesting scenarios are discussed as follows. First, when a CR
282
the interference of unsynchronized stations. As shown in Fig. 11.4, when
STA 5 identifies a new CFP, it waits for rt-CTS or data frame from STA 3
or 4. Once the channel is idle longer than PIFS as shown in the n+1th CFP,
STA 5 directly sends rt-CTS to prevent the non-real-time frame transmissions
from unsynchronized stations. Therefore, the frame synchronization can be
maintained even though some frames are lost due to signal outage.
At last, one may be curious that whether the new distributed frame syn-
chronization mechanism is backward compatible and interoperable with the
legacy DCF and PCF modes in IEEE 802.11 WLAN. On the one hand, the
transmission in DCF mode has no influence to that in our invited reservation
procedure. Because the maximum spacing between any two delay-sensitive
frames in our MAC protocol (PIFS) is shorter than the minimum duration
of two data frames in DCF mode (DIFS), i.e., PIFS < DIFS. The frame
transmission in DCF mode cannot disturb the reserved frame transmission
in CFP. On the other hand, the neighbor list establishment helps secondary
users to recognize the transmission in the PCF mode and treat them like
primary user transmission. Therefore, with the gating mechanism and infor-
mation in PIT, all the secondary user transmissions in our MAC protocol are
postponed until the end of PCF mode to avoid interfering the transmission
in PCF mode.
11.6 Throughput Analysis
In this section, we analyze the throughput of our proposed cognitive MAC
protocol with mixed delay-sensitive and non-real-time data traffic flows. To
ease the analysis, we make the following assumptions: (1) the spectrum us-
age information is correctly obtained by the spectrum sensing, identification,

11.7 Simulation
In this section, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed cognitive
MAC protocol through the NS-2 simulator [192]. We also use the IEEE
802.11 DCF mode with the RTS/CTS handshaking for the performance com-
parison. The RTS/CTS DCF mode is naturally a good candidate for sec-
ondary user in a cognitive network because the carrier sensing avoids inter-
fering primary user transmissions at the moment of any packet transmission.
Furthermore, most of current cognitive MAC protocol still use the CSMA/CA
MAC protocol to resolve the collisions among secondary user [190,193,194].
Thus, the performance of the CSMA/CA MAC protocol with RTS/CTS
handshaking can be a baseline in a cognitive network.
11.7.1 Simulation Environment
To begin with, we explain the considered simulation environment. In this
paper, we consider two network topologies, in which nodes are 1) allocated
in one cluster and 2) distributed to three clusters in string-type topology. In
the first network topology, all the primary and secondary users are located
in the same cluster with the area of 10 m × 10 m. On the other hand, in the
second network topology, primary users are only located in Region II, but
secondary users are distributed at all the three regions, as shown in Fig. 11.7.

the maximum retry limit, will not be taken into account for the access
delay calculation.
• Fairness is evaluated by the maximum standard deviation of the frame
access delay among all the non-real-time traffic flows. Note that the
available transmission time for the secondary user in a cognitive net-
work is short. The reduced delay variance among traffic flows represents
that all secondary users have equal opportunities to send packets on
the channel during the short transmission time. Thus, the maximum
standard deviation of access delay among user is more appropriate for
measuring the fairness performance in a cognitive network.
• Dropping rate is defined as the ratio of the number of dropped frames
to the total number of transmitted frames. The frame is considered
to be dropped if the access delay of the delay-sensitive frame or the
primary user transmission is beyond 20 msec.
11.7.3 Numerical Results
First, we examine the dropping rate of primary user transmissions in the net-
work topology that all user are located in one cluster, as shown in Fig. 11.8.
Because of the gating mechanism and the information stored in PIT, the
proposed cognitive MAC protocol dynamically stops secondary users send-
ing frames at the time when primary users access the channel. Surprisingly,
the dropping rate of primary users in the legacy CSMA/CA MAC protocol
is less than 3%. This phenomenon results from the carrier sensing that the
node performs before sending packets. This carrier sensing satisfies the basic
requirement of spectrum sensing in a cognitive network. However, the carrier
sensing only detects the channel at the time instance when it executes instead

for throughput computation. On the contrary, all the delay-sensitive frames
in the legacy CSMA/CA MAC protocol still contend for the channel with
other non-real-time frames. The contention leads the access delay of delay-
sensitive frames is beyond the delay constraint due to retransmissions, and
causes the neglect of those frame in throughput calculation. Furthermore,
the gating mechanism in the proposed cognitive MAC protocol reduces the
collisions in the CP. Hence, the throughput of the proposed MAC is better
than that of the CSMA/CA MAC protocol in supporting mixed-type traffic
flows.

includes 10 rt-nodes and various number of nrt-nodes establishing voice and
FTP data traffic flows, respectively. As shown in the figure, the result from
the analytical model by (11.4) are close that from simulations, especially
for the case with a small packet size. Even for the large packet size, the
discrepancy between analysis and simulation is still less than 3%. As shown
in the figure, the throughput still remains stable even in the system with
more than 100 nrt-nodes. This observation illustrates that the use of small
CW size in the linear backoff algorithm and stall avoidance scheme do not
deteriorate the network stability in a crowded environment.

1. Introduce a queueing-theoretical framework to characterize the effects
of the general channel usage behaviors with multiple handoffs.
2. Design system parameters for load-balancing multiuser spectrum deci-
sion schemes to evenly distribute the traffic loads of secondary users to
multiple channels.
3. Propose a traffic-adaptive spectrum handoff scheme, which changes the
target channel sequence of spectrum handoffs based on traffic condi-
tions.
4. Determine the optimal target channel sequence for the proactive spec-
trum handoff.
5. Provide a framework to determine whether the spectrum sensing tech-
nology can effectively shorten the extended data delivery time under
various sensing time and traffic parameters.
6. Develop a cross-layer admission control rule for the secondary users.
7. Analyze the latency performance of various MAC protocols.
8. Propose a location-aware concurrent transmission MAC protocol.
9. Propose a neighbor-aware cognitive MAC protocol.
In the following, we summarize the results from the above contributions.
302
duce the overall system time compared to the sensing-based scheme when
the traffic loads of the secondary users is light, whereas the sensing-based
scheme performs better in the condition of heavy traffic loads. This obser-
vation provide an important insight into design a traffic-adaptive spectrum
decision scheme in the presence of sensing errors.
12.3 Proactive Spectrum Handoff
In this part, we have used the PRP M/G/1 queueing network model to char-
acterize the spectrum usage behaviors with multiple handoffs. We studied
the latency performance of the secondary connections by considering the ef-
fects of (1) generally distributed service time; (2) various operating channels;
and (3) queueing behaviors of multiple secondary connections. The proposed
model can accurately estimate the extended data delivery time of different
proactively designed target channel sequences. On top of this model, we
showed the extended data delivery time of the secondary connections based
on the always-staying and the always-changing sequences in the IEEE 802.22
standard. If the secondary users can adaptively adopt the better target chan-
nel sequence according to traffic conditions, the extended data delivery time
can be improved significantly compared to the existing target channel selec-
tion methods, especially for the heavy traffic loads of the primary users.
12.4 Optimal Proactive Spectrum Handoff
In this part, we have investigated the Cumulative Handoff Delay Mini-
mization Problem. We formulated an optimization problem of determining
a target channel sequence for multiple handoffs with the objective of mini-
304
control rule for the secondary users and can provide a framework to deter-
mine whether the spectrum sensing technology can effectively shorten the
data delivery time under various sensing time.
12.6 Interference-Avoiding Spectrum Sharing
In this part, we proposed an adaptively arrival rate control mechanism by
adjusting traffic admission probability of the secondary connections in order
to maintain the interference constraint of the primary users and the latency
requirement of the secondary users. Although a larger traffic admission prob-
ability for the secondary connections can increase channel utilization, it leads
to more interference on the primary connections as well as more contention
between the secondary connections. In order to find the best traffic admis-
sion probability, we formulate this issue as a cross-layer optimization problem
by considering the effects of sensing errors and power outage in the physical
layer, traffic admission probability in the MAC layer, and the traffic statistics
as well as the QoS constraints in the application layer. The analytical results
show the optimal traffic admission probabilities under various cross-layer pa-
rameters and provide important insight into the design tradeoffs between the
system-level performance measure (channel utilization) and the user-level
performance measures (interference ratio and transmission latency).
12.7 Latency Analysis for Spectrum Sharing
There are two major contributions in this thesis. First, we propose an ana-
lytical model to evaluate the per packet dynamic channel access latency for
the CR MAC with dedicated and embedded control channels. The per packet
306
concurrent transmission opportunity can be identified first, it is clear that
the need of the time- and energy-consuming wide-band spectrum scanning
process required by most existing cognitive radio systems can be reduced
dramatically.
12.9 Neighbor-Aware Cognitive MAC Proto-
col for Spectrum Sharing
In this part, we have proposed a cognitive MAC protocol to establish an
overlaying cognitive ad hoc network with QoS provisioning in the presence
of the legacy wireless systems. The proposed mechanisms can supplement
the insufficiency of the legacy CSMA/CA MAC protocol to fulfill the goals
of the cognitive wireless networks. With respect to the four stages in the
cognition cycle, we suggest the following techniques:
• Neighbor list establishment in the observe stage: to help CR users
having the knowledge of the spectrum usage by the primary and other
CR users;
• Improved contention resolution algorithm in the plan stage: to
prevent CR users from interfering the existing legacy system and to
allow CR users to efficiently and fairly access the channel in the short
spare time of the spectrum usage by primary users.
• Invited reservation procedure in the decide stage: to schedule the
transmissions of delay-sensitive traffic with satisfactory QoS require-
ments for secondary user without interfering the legacy system and to
dynamically allocate the bandwidth for various traffic types to avoid
the starvation issue for low priority traffic.

quential sensing. For example, in the sensing-based spectrum decision
scheme in Chapter 4, we assume that the secondary user performs wide-
band sensing to find the idle channel when a new connection request
arrives at CR network. In fact, the secondary user can perform sequen-
tial sensing to find the idle channel. In this case, the sensing procedures
can be terminated once one idle channel is found, and thus the sensing
time can be shorter than nτ . Furthermore, in Chapters 4 and 8, we
assume that the class-A missed detection and false alarm probabilities
are constant. In fact, as transmission time increases, missed detection
and false alarm probabilities can be reduced because the sensing results
at the previous sensing phases can be employed to improve the accu-
racy of the sensing results at the following sensing phases. Hence, it is
also worthwhile to investigate the effects of variable missed detection
and false alarm probabilities in Chapters 4 and 8. Besides, the effects
of the class-B missed detection is another important research issue.
2. From the viewpoint of spectrum decision issue, it is worthwhile deter-
mining the optimal distribution probability vector for the probability-
based spectrum decision method when the secondary connections may
have different opinions on the observed traffic statistics λ

B Derivation of ω
(k)
i
First, we consider the type-i secondary connections whose default channels
are channel η. Denote ω
(k)
i,η as the arrival rate of these secondary connections
at channel k, p
(k)
i,η as the probability that these secondary connections are
interrupted again at channel k, and Φ
(k)
i,η as the effective service time of these
secondary connections at channel k. Hence, we have
ω
(k)
i =
M∑
η=1
ω
(k)
i,η , (B1)

i =
M∑

(k)

E[Φ
(k)
i,η ] , (B3)
and
E[(Φ
(k)

2] =
M∑
η=1
ω
(k)
i,η
ω
(k)
i
E[(Φ
(k)
i,η )
2] . (B4)
Next, we derive ω
(k)
i,η as follows. For the type-i secondary connections
whose default channels are channel η, their operating channels are channel si,η
340
their effective duration at channel k can be expressed as follows:
Φ
(k)
0,η =
 0 , k 6= s0,ηmin(Γ(η)p , X(η)s ) , k = s0,η , (C1)
where min(a, b) is the minimum function. It returns the minimal value among
a and b. Hence, the cdf of Φ
(k)
0,η can be expressed as follows:
F
(k)
0,η (φ) =
 0 , k 6= s0,η1− [(1− A(η)p (φ))(1− F (η)s (φ))] , k = s0,η . (C2)
where A
(k)
p (γ) and F
(k)
s (φ) are the cdfs of Γ
(k)
p and X
(k)
s , respectively. They
are system parameters and are known in advance.
Next, let Φ˜
(k)
i,η be the remaining transmission time when a type-i secondary
connection whose default channel is channel η is interrupted at channel k.
Furthermore, the pdf and the cdf of Φ˜
(k)
i,η are denoted by f˜
(k)
i,η (φ) and F˜
(k)
i,η (φ),
respectively. According to the definition of Φ˜
(k)
i,η , we have
Φ˜
(k)
0,η =
 0 , k 6= s0,ηX(η)s − Φ(η)0,η , k = s0,η . (C3)
Because the pdf of X
(η)
s has been known and the pdf of Φ
(η)
0,η can be derived
by differentiating (C2), we can derive F˜
(η)
0,η (φ) as follows:
F˜
(η)
0,η (φ)
= Pr(Φ˜
(η)
0,η ≤ φ)
= Pr(X(η)s − Φ(η)0,η ≤ φ)
= Pr(X(η)s −min(Γ(η)p , X(η)s ) ≤ φ)
=
∫ ∫
x−min(γ,x)≤φ
a(η)p (γ)f
(η)
s (x)ηγηx , (C4)
where a
(k)
p (γ) and f
(k)
s (x) are the pdfs of Γ
(k)
p and X
(k)
s , respectively. Then,
we can obtain f˜
(k)
0,η (φ) by differentiating F˜
(k)
0,η (φ). Furthermore, according to
342
i+ 1) for any i can be expressed as follows:
F
(k)
i,η (φ) =
 0 , k 6= si,η1− [(1− A(si,η)p (φ))(F˜ (si−1,η)i−1,η (φ|N ≥ i))] , k = si,η ,
(C9)
and
f˜
(si,η)
i,η (φ|N ≥ i+1) =
f˜
(si,η)
i,η (φ)
Pr(N ≥ i+ 1) =
f˜
(si,η)
i,η (φ)∏i
j=0 p
(sj,η)
j,η
=
f˜
(si,η)
i,η (φ)∏i
j=0 λ
(sj,η)
p E[Φ
(sj,η)
j,η ]
,
(C10)
where F˜
(si−1,η)
i−1,η (φ|N ≥ i) is the integration of f˜ (si−1,η)i−1,η (φ|N ≥ i). Because
the arrivals of the primary connections follow the Poisson process, we have
A
(k)
p (γ) = 1− e−λ(k)p γ. Based on the relationships of (C9) and (C10), we can
derive the functions f
(k)
i,η (φ) from F
(k)
i,η (φ), and thus E[Φ
(k)
i,η ] and E[(Φ
(k)
i,η )
2] can
be also evaluated.
D Derivation of Pr(X˜p = x)
Now, we show how to derive Pr(X˜p = x) from fp(x). Let fp(x) = Pr(Xp =
x). We can have
Pr(X˜p = x˜) =
X˜p∑
x=1
Pr(X˜p = x˜|Xp = x)Pr(Xp = x) . (D1)
Referring to [135], we find that Pr(X˜p = x˜|Xp = x) follows the negative
binomial distribution with parameter PMρs. That is,
Pr(X˜p = x˜|Xp = x) =
(
x˜− 1
x˜− x
)
(1− PMρs)x(PMρs)x˜−x . (D2)

表 Y04 
Based on this model, we derive a new performance measure - the overall system 
time of the secondary connections. The overall system time is an important 
performance measure to provide the quality of service (QoS) provisioning service 
for the secondary users. It is defined as the duration from the instant that data 
arrives at system until the instant of finishing the whole transmission. Clearly, 
multiple interruptions from the high-priority primary users will increase the 
overall system time of the low-priority secondary users. Based on the PRP M/G/1 
queuing model, the impacts of multiple interruptions on the overall system time 
can be evaluated. On top of this model, a spectrum sensing, a spectrum decision, a 
spectrum sharing, and a spectrum handoff algorithms are investigated to reduce 
the overall system time. From the numerical results, we can design better 
spectrum management policies to satisfy the QoS requirement of the secondary 
users in CR networks and provide useful insight into the design tradeoff for 
different spectrum management technologies.
