1. Introduction 
The critical linewidths have been reduced to deep submicrometer dimensions in 
ultralarge-scale integration (ULSI) circuits, thus increasing on-chip packing density and improving 
the performance of devices. The problems of resistance-capacitance (RC) delay and 
electromigration are increasingly serious with the decrease in dimensions of interconnections. 
Copper has been used instead of aluminum for the interconnection in ULSI devices because of its 
lower electrical resistivity (1.7μΩ-cm) and higher electromigration resistance as compared with 
aluminum (2.7μΩ-cm).（1, 2） Copper interconnects can be deposited by physical vapor deposition 
(PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrochemical deposition (ELD) and electroless 
deposition.（3-5） Electroless deposition is under increased investigation as an alternative to other 
techniques for copper metallization due to its low processing temperature, superior deposition 
selectivity, self-aligning and conformal deposition ability for high aspect ratio features filling. 
Furthermore, the electroless copper deposition possesses good electrical characteristics and 
compatibility with low-K materials.（6-11） 
However, copper diffuses readily into the Si and SiO2 to form copper silicides which cause the 
degradation of electrical performance. Therefore, an effective diffusion barrier for preventing the 
copper diffusion is one of the most important aspects of the Cu metallization. A suitable diffusion 
barrier of Cu should have slow transport rate for Cu atom and strong adhesion to the substrate and 
Cu interconnect. Moreover, the diffusion barrier should have low electrical resistivity and superior 
thermal stability. There are many materials which have been studied and developed for being a 
 6
substrates as diffusion barriers between the electroless Cu and silicon. The failure behavior of the 
electroless CoWP film in Cu/CoWP/Si sample and the effect of CoWP film thickness on diffusion 
barrier properties have been investigated by TEM, SEM, XRD and sheet resistance measurement. 
2. Experimental 
    The substrates used in this study for electroless plating CoWP and Cu were p-type (100) 
silicon wafer (resistivity about 1~20 Ω ㎝). The silicon wafers were degreased in acetone by 
ultrasonic vibration. After degreasing, the degreased specimens were cleaned with a solution mixed 
one part of H2SO4 and one part of H2O2 for 10 minutes and then etched in 10% HF aqueous solution 
to remove oxide. Prior to the electroless plating process, it is necessary to sensitize and activate the 
depositing surface of silicon wafer using SnCl2/HCl solution (40g/l SnCl2 + 40ml/l HCl) and 
PdCl2/HCl solution (0.15g/l PdCl2 + 3ml/l HCl). The specimens were rinsed in distilled water after 
each pretreatment step. The electroless CoWP and Cu films were deposited on the activated silicon 
substrate sequentially. The electroless plating bath compositions and operating parameters of 
electroless CoWP and Cu are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The thickness of electroless copper film 
in the Cu/CoWP/Si sample was controlled about 120 nm. The Cu/CoWP/Si samples with 30, 60, 75 
and 100 nm electroless CoWP films were made for studying the effect of CoWP film thickness on 
the diffusion barrier between copper and silicon. The as-deposited samples were annealed in rapid 
thermal annealing (RTA) furnace at 300-800 ℃ for 5 min in vacuum. 
    The sheet resistances of various samples were measured by a four-point probe. Surface 
morphologies of various samples were observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL 
 8
500 ℃ for 5 min, it slightly increases at 500-600 ℃ and increases dramatically after 600 ℃. The 
sheet resistance of Cu/CoWP 60 nm/Si varies like that of Cu/CoWP 30nm/Si. The sheet resistances 
of the Cu/CoWP 75 nm/Si and Cu/CoWP 100 nm/Si increase abruptly after annealing at 650 ℃. 
The electrical measurements of Cu/CoWP/Si samples with CoWP films of various thicknesses 
reveal that the 30 nm electroless CoWP film in the Cu/CoWP/Si structure prevents the penetration 
of copper up to 500 ℃; the 75 nm-thick electroless CoWP does so up to 600 ℃, indicating that 
increasing the thickness of the electroless CoWP film effectively increases the failure temperature 
of the Cu/CoWP/Si samples. 
The samples were observed using SEM, TEM and XRD to understand the failure behavior of 
electroless CoWP film and the associated phase formations in the Cu/CoWP/Si structure. Figures 
2(a)-(e) present the SEM surface morphology of the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si samples that are annealing 
at 500 (b), 550 (c), 600 (d) and 650 ℃ (e) for 5 min and are in the as-deposited state (a), 
respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), the surface morphology of the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si 
that is annealed at 500 ℃ is the same as that of the as-deposited sample. The observation indicates 
that the 30 nm electroless CoWP film can validly prevent the diffusion of copper into the Si 
substrate up to 500 ℃. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) shows the surface morphology of the Cu/CoWP 30 
nm/Si samples annealed at 550 and 600 ℃, respectively. In Fig. 2(c), many tiny granular particles 
are present in the copper film when the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si was annealed at 550 ℃. After annealing 
at 600 ℃, many large conglomerations are formed in the holes of Cu film, as seen in Fig. 2(d). The 
main elements of these conglomerations are Co and Si, as characterized by EDS. The EDS analysis 
 10
with annealing temperature also resembles that of Cu/CoWP 75 nm/Si. These SEM surface 
morphology observations of the Cu/CoWP/Si samples that are annealed at various temperatures can 
validly account for the variation of the sheet resistance with the annealing temperature. 
     Figures 4(a)-(c) present the XRD patterns of the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si, Cu/CoWP 60 nm/Si and 
Cu/CoWP 75 nm/Si before and after annealing at 500-800 ℃ for 5 min, respectively. In these 
patterns of Cu/CoWP/Si samples with various thicknesses of electroless CoWP films, only the 
copper peaks are obtained from the as-deposited state. The disappearance of the cobalt peaks in the 
as-deposited Cu/CoWP/Si samples may follow from the fact that the amount of CoWP is too little 
to be detected precisely by XRD and the electroless CoWP film with the amorphous structure yields 
a broad peak that is hidden in the background of the diffraction pattern. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the 
pattern of the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si annealed at 500 ℃ is similar to that of the as-deposited state and 
the peaks of copper from the sample that was annealed in 500 ℃ are sharper than those from that in 
the as-deposited state. This result indicates the grain growth and the defect annihilation in the Cu 
film during the thermal annealing. As mentioned above, the sheet resistance therefore decreases 
upon annealing at the temperatures below 500 ℃. Additionally, the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si annealed at 
550 and 600 ℃ exhibit similar patterns to that annealed at 500 ℃, indicating no variety of phases at 
500-600 ℃. In fact, observations of surface morphology reveal tiny granular particles and cobalt 
silicide conglomerations that have formed in the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si that was annealed at 550-600 
℃. The inconsistency between the results of XRD analysis and SEM observation is clarified by the 
TEM observations, which will be discussed later. As the annealing temperature rises to 650 ℃, the 
 12
shows that the copper silicides and cobalt silicides are formed at 700 ℃, but SEM observations of 
the surface morphology show the breakage of copper film and the formation of cobalt silicide 
conglomerations at 650 ℃. The inconsistency between the results of XRD analysis and the SEM 
observations was also observed in the Cu/ CoWP 30 nm/Si and Cu/CoWP 60 nm/Si. 
      Cross-sectional TEM analysis was performed to clarify the inconsistency between the XRD 
analysis and SEM observation and elucidate the failure behavior of the electroless CoWP film in the 
Cu/ CoWP/Si sample during thermal annealing. Figures 5(a)-(d) show the TEM cross-sectional 
micrographs of Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si that was annealed at 500 (b), 550 (c) and 650 ℃ (d) for 5 min 
and of that in the as-deposited state (a), respectively. In Fig. 5(a), clear interfaces exist between the 
electroless copper film, the electroless CoWP film and the Si substrate in the as-deposited 
Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si. Figure 5(b) shows the TEM cross-sectional image of the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si 
that was annealed at 500 ℃ for 5 min. It has a similar microstructure to that of the as-deposited 
sample. The interfaces in the Cu/CoWP 30 nm/Si sample that was annealed at 500 ℃ are still clear 
and the multilayer structure appeared to be preserved. The TEM observations of are good evidence 
that the 30 nm electroless CoWP film is stable between the electroless copper film and the Si 
substrate up to 500 ℃, which result is consistent with the SEM observations. After annealing at 550 
℃, facet-like grains are clearly present at the silicon substrate and granular grains had appeared on 
the copper film, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The facet-like grains comprise Cu and Si and the granular 
grains are Co, as determined by EDS. The results reveal the interdiffusion of copper and cobalt, and 
that the 30 nm electroless CoWP film fails to prevent the diffusion of copper into the Si substrate in 
 14
copper produces a hole in copper film. Finally, the silicon in the copper silicide reacts with the 
cobalt granular grain on the top of copper silicide to form the cobalt silicide in the hole of the 
copper film. 
4. Conclusions 
In this work, the electroless CoWP film deposited on the silicon substrate as a diffusion barrier 
for the electroless Cu and silicon has been studied. Four different Cu 100 nm/CoWP/Si stacked 
samples with 30, 60, 75 and 100 nm electroless CoWP films were prepared and annealed in a rapid 
thermal annealing furnace at 300-800 ℃ for 5 min. The failure behavior of the electroless CoWP 
film in the Cu/CoWP/Si sample and the effect of CoWP film thickness on the diffusion barrier 
properties have been investigated by TEM, SEM, XRD and sheet resistance measurement. The 
composition of the electroless CoWP films is 89.4 at.％Co, 2.4 at.％W and 8.2 at.％P. The result of 
sheet resistance measurement shows the electroless CoWP film is a good diffusion barrier for the 
electroless copper film and silicon. The 30 nm electroless CoWP film can prevent the copper 
penetration up to 500 ℃, and the 75 nm electroless CoWP film can survive up to 600 ℃ at least. 
Therefore, increasing the thickness of electroless CoWP films effectively increases the failure 
temperature of the Cu/CoWP/Si samples. The observations of SEM and TEM show the failure of 
the electroless CoWP diffusion barrier in Cu/CoWP/Si during the thermal annealing is caused by 
the interdiffusion of the copper and cobalt.
