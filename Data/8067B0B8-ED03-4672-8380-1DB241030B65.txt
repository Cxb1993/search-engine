Abstract 
Secretion is the process of elaborating, releasing, and oozing chemicals, or a secreted chemical 
substance from a cell or gland. In contrast to excretion, the substance may have a certain function, 
rather than being a waste product. Secreted proteins usually contain a signal sequence with all the 
essential information required to target them for secretion. However, , some proteins like fibroblast 
growth factors (FGF-1, FGF-2), interleukins (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta), galectins and thioredoxin are 
exported by an alternative pathway. This is known as non-classical secretion and works without a 
signal sequence. This project is one-year project, aims to propose an efficient sequence-based approach, 
namely Sec-PSSM-GO, to predict 1) non-classical secretory proteins in mammalian genomes; 2) 
non-classical secretory proteins in Gram-positive bacteria. The Sec-PSSM-GO method using 
PSSM-GOmining identifies two informative feature sets of position-specific-scoring-matrix (PSSM) 
profiles and GO (Gene Ontology) terms。The small set of m top-ranked GO term features is first 
identified by using a simple ranking scheme, where m<<n. In the ranking scheme, all of the n GO 
terms are ranked according to their scores—a score is the difference in the occurrence frequencies 
of the GO term between positive and negative datasets, where n is the total number of GO terms in 
a complete annotation set (a component of 1 is assigned when the annotation is hit and 0 is assigned 
otherwise). The number m is determined using the number of GO terms with scores exceeding the 
mean of n scores. This work combines the m GO terms with PSSM into PSSM-GO composition 
features to represent secretory proteins. The set of PSSM-GO features are identified by using an 
intelligent genetic algorithm (IGA) based method in conjunction with the support vector machine 
(SVM) learning model to mine characteristic PSSM profiles.  
To evaluate the proposed Sec-PSSM-GO method, two existing methods, SPRED [1] and 
NClassG+ [2] as well as their datasets, ES_SPRED and PS(prokaryotic secretory proteins), 
respectively, are adopted for performance comparisons. An additional mammalian dataset, ES 
(eukaryotic secretory proteins) from ES_SPRED, is established to have a sequence identity of 25%.  
Using this ES dataset, the Sec-GO method, a part of this Sec-PSM-GO project, identifies a set of  
m=501 GO terms and obtains a test accuracy of 96.8%. Additionally, the Sec-GO method using 
m=436 top-rank GO terms yields an independent test accuracy of 96.7% on ES_SPRED, better than 
that of SPRED which has an accuracy of 82.2%. Compared with the NClassG+ method, which has 
a test accuracy of 90.0%, the proposed Sec-GO method yields a higher accuracy of 94.5% on the 
一定的作用的。若分泌蛋白質有信號序列(signal sequence)參與，則分泌途徑為典型(classical)
的內質網(endoplasmic reticulum，簡稱 ER)- 高爾基體(Golgi Apparatus)途徑；若沒有信號序列
參與，則是非典型(non-classical)分泌途徑。 
真核細胞(eukaryotic cells)，包括人類細胞，擁有高度進化過程中的分泌系統(圖 2.1) [3]。
其分泌蛋白質是在內質網(endoplasmic reticulum)合成的。分泌蛋白質合成的開始階段和其他
的蛋白質是一樣的。首先，是攜帶訊息 RNA(message RNA，簡稱 mRNA)形成，並且被運輸
到細胞質(cytosol)得以和自由胞漿核糖體(cytosolic ribosome)互動。NH3-ter是一個由6至12 個
具有疏水性(hydrophobic)側鏈氨基酸(amino acids)的信號序列(signal sequence)。這個 NH3-ter
信號序列可以被所謂的 SRP(Signal Recognition Particle)細胞質蛋白質所辨認，來停止蛋白質
的轉譯 (translation)、協助 mRNA核糖體複合物運輸到位於細胞內質網 (endoplasmic 
reticulum，簡稱 ER)膜上的轉譯通道 (translocon)。當 NH3-ter 序列到達轉譯通道時，這個轉
譯通道蛋白質便會打開，而 NH3-ter 序列便順勢引入到內質網腔(ER luman)。接著，NH3-ter
序列被刪除，而蛋白質轉譯隨著蛋白質合成鏈移動通過合作轉譯方式的轉譯通道
(co-translational translocon)，而繼續進行(圖 2.1 步驟 a)。分泌蛋白質在內質網轉譯後，也在內
質網確認正確地折疊蛋白質(圖 2.1 步驟 b)。如果在嘗試第一次折疊不是成功的，便要嘗試第
二次折疊。除了蛋白質須折疊外，也有一些聚醣(glycan)會加入於蛋白質裡。之後，含有正確
折疊蛋白質便被使用外套式蛋白質 COPII 的囊泡(vesicle)送到高爾基體(Golgi Apparatus) (圖
2.1 步驟 c)。如果第二次蛋白質折疊也失敗，那麼錯誤折疊的蛋白質會輸出到細胞質，而且標
示不良品，並退化成一個蛋白酶(proteasome) (圖 2.1 步驟 d)。這即是具有信號序列的典型性
(classical)內質網高爾基分泌途徑。 
至於細菌物種上的分泌機制是屬於原核細胞上的分泌機制。致病性細菌(pathogenic 
bacteria)使用多種機制穿透其細胞膜將其有毒性因子(virulence factors)侵入動物與植物宿主細
胞具有保護性質的上皮組織層，進入宿主身體。此毒性因子蛋白質即是入侵效應分子(effectors)
蛋白質。例如霍亂弧菌(Vibrio cholerae)分泌的霍亂毒素(cholera toxin)即為入侵效應分子蛋白
質。這些輸送入侵效應分子的機制即為分泌系統，是細菌能得以適應、生存運作於周遭環境
非常重要的一項機制。

菌、古細菌(archaea)的生命系統是相同的。大部分蛋白質經由胞質膜到輸出、或是與胞質膜
組合都是由進化性保守的 Sec 分泌系統處理(圖 2.2)。Sec 分泌系統也是另一種保守的分泌系

並結合 PseAAC 等多種特徵及合奏式分類器(ensemble classifiers)來預測亞細胞中多種位置的

圖 3.1 說明這 Sec-PSSM-GO 預測系統，包含數個重要的部分：1) 研究搜集整理哺乳動

(2) 研究分析訓練資料集中基因地圖註解(GO)特徵 n 維度向量空間 
分泌蛋白質序列與基因地圖註解的關係是經由蛋白質序列編號(accession numbers)所建
立的，即是蛋白質序列編號是用來搜尋基因地圖註解資料庫的鑰匙。然而，並不是每一未知、
新的蛋白質序列都具有編號，所以應用 BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法[22]去找與欲預測蛋白
質序列極相似、同源蛋白質序列的編號，藉以查詢基因地圖註解資料庫其相關聯的 GO 特徵
是需要的[18, 23]。 
應用 BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法於目前最新 GOA 基因地圖註解資料庫[9] 與其搭配
的 SWISS-PROT[21]蛋白質知識庫，依序從 h{1, 2…5} and e{10-1, 10-2…10-10}搜尋出相對
應的基因地圖註解。根據文獻[15, 24]得知 e=10-9，是個良好的參數值。即使始使用這個參數
值，BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法仍會因為同源參數 h 設定值不同，而取得不同品質的基因
地圖註解集。因此，使用 KNN 分類器來評量哪個 h 參數設定值獲取最高品質的基因地圖註
解集。圖 3.2 顯示出 h= 5 參數設定值對於訓練樣本資料集 ESL、PSL 都有最佳的預測準確率，
分別為 90.6%、85.7%，其中使用最近鄰居數量 k=1 於 KNN 分類器中。 
 
圖 3.2 使用不同的同源參數設定值 h 所產生的 KNN 預測準確率 
當使用 BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法來擷取相似蛋白質序列以進一步取得 GO 特徵，便
會想當然爾以為是 BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法的貢獻，提高預測非典型分泌蛋白質序列
的準確率。為了破除此迷思，所以統計有註解四個亞細胞中位置(表 3.2 中 “extracellular“、
“periplasm“、“cytoplasm“、“nucleus“)的分泌蛋白質序列數量。舉 HES1_MOUSE (P35428)分
泌蛋白質序列為例子，來描述統計的過程。當 BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法搭配(h, e) = (5, 
10-9)運用時，這個分泌蛋白質序列有五個相似蛋白質序列：P35428、Q04666、Q14469、
Q3ZBG4、Q5PPM5，其相似程度超過 90%。其中 P35428 是這個 HES1_MOUSE (P35428)分
泌蛋白質序列本身，應該移除，以維持本計畫將要預測的分泌蛋白質序列，視為未知的分泌
蛋白質序列。剩餘四個相似分泌蛋白質序列都註解“nucleus”亞細胞位置，結果預測正確的統
計數量變累加一個。這個統計過程多少是高估的，因為有些分泌蛋白質序列是註解多個亞細
胞位置[25]。統計結果如表 3.1 在 ESL、PSL 訓練資料集中分別有 45.2% (=313/692)、46.0% 
(=392/852)的分泌蛋白質序列數量比例，單使用 BLAST 量測蛋白質序列相似法，就能正確預
測非典型分泌蛋白質序列。 
步驟 3: 計算每一個 GO 特徵出現頻率 fk，是將步驟 1 的出現次數除以步驟 1 的出現次數總和。
例如 GO:0005737 在哺乳動物 ESL 典型、非典型分泌蛋白質訓練資料集的出現頻率，
是 0.046930、0.007720。 
步驟 4: 針對每一個 GO 特徵，計算其典型、非典型分泌蛋白質訓練資料集的出現頻率的差
值 Dk =|fk  Fk|，再依照次數差值由大而小排序，將此差值分數視為此 GO 特徵的分

(=|0.007720 0.046930|)。 
步驟 5: 正規化所有 n 個 GO 特徵的分數於[0, 1]之間，定義為{s1, s2, … sn}. 例如 GO:0005737
在哺乳動物 ESL 分泌蛋白質訓練資料集的正規化分數是 0.628(表 3.5)。排序前 m 個
GO 特徵，極為具有辨識性的特徵。表 3.5、3.6 列出 ESL、PSL 分泌蛋白質訓練資料

 (4) 研究分析相同分數的 GO 特徵子集 
首先統計每一個 GO 特徵的正規化分數，並計算其平均值，如圖 3.3 (a)所示 ESL 分泌蛋
白質訓練資料集的分數平均值分別為 0.009。將有>0.009、相同分數的 GO 特徵蒐集成一個個

從大量長度為個 PSSM-GO 特徵篩選具有資訊性、少量的特徵子集(數量為 r)，可視為
尋求組合最佳化問題(combinatorial optimization problem) C(, r)上的解。而雙目標智慧型基因

中直交交配(Orthogonal array crossover，OAX)系統化推理的方式，可以有效率地搜尋 C(, r)
解的空間。並且藉由繼承 C(, r)空間中的一組良好的解，有效率地搜尋 C(,r+1)空間找到此
組合最佳化問題的一組完整無法鎖定的解(non-dominated solution)，亦即每次執行實驗都可能
獲取不同的解。其中尋獲最高準確率、最少量的特徵子集 (數量為 r)為其雙目標。
PSSM-GOmining 探勘平台是以智慧型基因演算法並隨繼承機制與 SVM 整合而建構成的

bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (i.e. the classical secretion pathway)
(Bendtsen and Wooldridge, 2009). However, many proteins secreted
via alternative routes (i.e. the non-classical secretion pathway) are
involved in pathogenesis (Bendtsen and Wooldridge, 2009). Six
secretion systems which transport proteins across the cytoplasmic
membrane have been identiﬁed in Gram-positive bacteria, secretion
(Sec), twin-arginine translocation (Tat), ﬂagella export apparatus
(FEA), ﬁmbrilin-protein exporter (FPE), hole-forming (holin), and
WXG100 secretion system (Wss) (Desvaux and He´braud, 2006).
Numerous bacterial proteins that are released via the Sec and Tat
secretion pathways can be secreted without N-terminal signal pep-
tides and are also called non-classically secreted proteins, such as
proteins released via Wss in Gram-positive bacteria (Bendtsen et al.,
2005a; Desvaux and He´braud, 2006).
Several sequence-based methods using hybrid feature types
have been developed to predict proteins secreted via non-classical
pathways (Bendtsen et al., 2004, 2005b; Garg and Raghava, 2008;
Hung et al., 2010; Kandaswamy et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010)
(Table 1). SecretomeP uses neural networks (NNs) with various
sequence-derived features comprising the number of atoms,
number of positively charged residues, low complexity regions,
transmembrane helices, propeptide cleavage sites and subcellular
localization to predict non-classical secretion in mammals
(Bendtsen et al., 2004). In addition to these feature types, Secreto-
meP also integrates additional feature types, such as amino acid
composition (AAC), secondary structure and disordered regions, and
uses an artiﬁcial NN (ANN) to predict non-classical secretory
proteins from Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria
(Bendtsen et al., 2005b).
The SRTpred method uses a hybrid approach to integrate a
PSI-BLAST module and support vector machine (SVM), which uses
AAC and dipeptide composition as input features (Garg and
Raghava, 2008). The SPRED method uses an information gain
algorithm with the ranking method to select the 50 top-ranked
features from 119 sequence-based features including frequencies
of tri-peptides and short peptides, the secondary structure, and
physicochemical properties (PCPs) (Kandaswamy et al., 2010).
The SecretP2.0 method fuses AAC, auto-covariance, and pseudo-
AAC (PseAAC) with SVM to predict bacterial l secretory proteins
(Yu et al., 2010). A novel method NClassGþ utilizes SVM with
various sequence transformation vectors, frequencies, di-pep-
tides, physicochemical factors, and the position speciﬁc weighting
matrix (PSSM) to predict non-classically secreted Gram-positive
bacterial proteins (Restrepo-Montoya et al., 2011).
These methods combine various types of complementary fea-
tures in designing accurate classiﬁers. Conversely, one SVM-based
method uses a single type of PCP features to predict non-classical
secretory proteins (Hung et al., 2010), where the set of informative
PCPs is identiﬁed by utilizing a high-performance feature selection
algorithm (Ho et al., 2004). Due to different design aims, feature
selection, classiﬁers and datasets used, determining which feature
type is the most effective in classiﬁcation is extremely difﬁcult.
However, this study aims to propose a novel and highly-effective
feature type to predict non-classical secretory proteins in eukar-
yotes and prokaryotes.
The Gene Ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary used to
describe the biology of a gene product in any organism (Ashburner
et al., 2000). The GO annotations have three structured and
controlled vocabularies (i.e. ontologies) that characterize individual
gene products in terms of their associated biological processes,
cellular components and molecular functions in a species-inde-
pendent manner. The Plant-associated Microbe Gene Ontology
(PAMGO) Consortium (Torto-Alalibo et al., 2009) has developed
standardized terms for describing biological processes and cellular
components that play important roles in the interactions between
microbes and plant and animal hosts, including bacterial secretion
processes (Tseng et al., 2009). Hence, the GO annotations have a
high potential in improve prediction performance when identifying
non-classically secreted proteins in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Notably, GO annotation has been used successfully to solve in
various sequence-based prediction problems and to extract many
other important features of proteins, such as protein subcellular
localization (Chou and Shen, 2010a; Chou et al., 2011, 2012; Shen
and Chou, 2010), enzyme classiﬁcation (Chou and Cai, 2004),
membrane protein type (Chou and Cai, 2005b), and protein–
protein interaction (Chou and Cai, 2005a). However, proteins are
often represented as high-dimensional vectors of n binary fea-
tures, where n is the total number of GO terms in a complete
annotation set (a component of 1 is assigned when the annotation
is hit and 0 is assigned otherwise). For example, 60,020 GO terms
are used in Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (Chou and Shen, 2010a) and Gneg-
mPLoc (Shen and Chou, 2010), both of which use PseAAC and GO
terms with ensemble classiﬁers to predict proteins in multiple
subcellular locations.
Additionally, each gene product is generally annotated by
only few GO terms, which results in long and sparse vectors
and renders the clustering algorithm problematic (Popescu et al.,
2006). Therefore, this study proposes a novel approach, namely
Sec-GO, to identify a small set of m top-ranked GO term features
for non-classical secretory protein prediction where m5n. The n
GO terms are ranked according to their scores—a score is the
difference in the occurrence frequencies of the GO term between
positive and negative datasets. The numberm is determined using
the number of GO terms with scores exceeding the mean of n
scores.
To evaluate the proposed Sec-GO method, two existing meth-
ods, SPRED (Kandaswamy et al., 2010) and NClassGþ (Restrepo-
Montoya et al., 2011) as well as their datasets, ES_SPRED and PS,
respectively, are adopted for performance comparisons. An addi-
tional mammalian dataset, ES from ES_SPRED, is established to
have a sequence identity of 25%. Using this ES dataset, the Sec-GO
method identiﬁesm¼501 GO terms and obtains a test accuracy of
96.8%. Additionally, the Sec-GO method using m¼436 top-rank
GO terms yields an independent test accuracy of 96.7% on
ES_SPRED, better than that of SPRED which has an accuracy of
82.2%. Compared with the NClassGþ method, which has a test

dataset is done with the purpose of estimating scores of GO terms,
identifying a small set of GO terms and ﬁnding the best para-
meters of a SVM to train the complete dataset. Similarly, the ES
dataset is divided into two parts, ESL for training and EST for
independent testing. Table 2 lists the numbers of proteins in each
dataset.
2.2. Homolog-based GO extraction
To identify novel non-classical secretory proteins, the pro-
posed Sec-GO method only uses sequences of query proteins
without their accession numbers. To extract GO terms from a GO
database, the accession number is indispensable. Thus, this work
ﬁrst uses BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990; Altschul et al., 1997) to ﬁnd
good homologies of a query protein from the Swiss-Prot database
(version 55.3). The accession numbers of the homologies are then
applied to the GO database (released on August 25, 2011) at
www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/ to retrieve annotated GO terms. Finally,
the query protein sequence is represented for GO-term feature
vectors.
2.2.1. Representation of GO-term features
According to Eq.(6) of a recent comprehensive review (Chou,
2011), the general form of Chou0s PseAAC can be formulated a
query protein P as
P¼ ½C1 C2    Ci    CnT ð1Þ
where T is a transpose operator, operator, while the subscript n
reﬂects the dimension of the vector and its value as well as the
components c1, c2, y will be deﬁned by a series of feature
extractions as elaborated below. Thus, when using the general
formulation of PseAAC to incorporate the GO information, there
are n GO terms, i.e.
P¼ ½CG1 CG2    CGi    CGn T ð2Þ
The variable ciG¼1 if a hit is found against the ith GO term for
the protein P; otherwise, ciG¼0, i¼1, 2, y, n. For example, the
query protein sequence in Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (Chou and Shen, 2010a)
are represented for n¼60,020 GO-term feature vector.
2.2.2. Retrieval of GO terms from homologies
Two threshold parameters of BLAST, the E-value and the
number of homologies h, have inﬂuence in the quality of homolog
GO term retrieval. This work ﬁnds (h, e)¼(5, 109) are good
trade-off values after using the k-nearest-neighbor classiﬁer
(k-NN) to test from eA{100, 101, 102,y, 1010} and hA{1,y, 5},
where prediction accuracies are 90.6% and 85.7% for the ESL and
PSL datasets, respectively (Fig. 2). The parameter value e¼109
may cause that two proteins are thought to be homologous when
they are only 460% pair-wise identical. The protein sequences
may be very few; thus, the k-NN classiﬁer can obtain a prediction
accuracy 485%.
2.2.3. Analysis of homolog annotation
Some secretory proteins in the ES and PS datasets are derived
according to the sequences annotated in such subcellular loca-
tions as ‘‘extracellular’’, ‘‘periplasm’’, ‘‘cytoplasm’’ and ‘‘nucleus’’
(Table 3). Therefore, the analysis of the subcellular location
annotations of homologies is important when using BLAST to ﬁnd
homologies of query secretory proteins and retrieve their corre-
sponding GO terms. First, this work ﬁnds all homologies for each
training sequence in datasets by using BLAST with (h, e)¼
(5, 109). This work then investigates the annotation information
of homologies (subcellular location) in the ‘‘General annotation’’
(Comments) ﬁeld. If one homology is annotated in the same
subcellular location as the query sequence, a true prediction is
obtained; otherwise, a false prediction is obtained.
Take one secretory protein HES1_MOUSE (P35428) as an
example. This protein sequence, which is annotated in the
‘‘nucleus’’ location, corresponds to ﬁve homologies, P35428,
Q04666, Q14469, Q3ZBG4 and Q5PPM5 by using BLAST with
(h, e)¼(5, 109), where the pair-sequence identity exceeds 90%.
Homolog P35428 is removed out due to all query proteins are
regarded as unknown in this work. The remaining four homo-
logies are annotated in the subcellular location ‘‘nucleus’’ through
retrieving the Swiss-Prot database, such that a true prediction is
obtained for HES1_MOUSE (P35428). This prediction rule is over-
estimated because some secretory proteins may be annotated in
multiple subcellular locations (Chou and Shen, 2010a).
The number g of (g) in Table 2 represents the number of true
predictions obtained by using the above-mentioned subcellular
location annotation. The percentages of true predictions are 45.2%
(¼313/692) and 46.0% (¼392/852) for the ESL and PSL datasets,
respectively. Roughly, 50% of the training datasets can be cor-
rectly distinguished between classical and non-classical secre-
tions. These analytical results reveal that this homolog search
using BLAST plays an important role in accurate prediction of
non-classical secretion; however, the homolog search cannot be
used alone when designing prediction methods. This fact moti-
vates this work to design a computational method based on the
homology search rather than only using this homology search to
identify non-classical secretion.
2.2.4. Distribution of GO terms
Tables 4 and 5 show the sizes of the complete sets of all GO terms
from the ESL and PSL datasets, where n¼2741 and 1039, respec-
tively. The percentage of training proteins obtained using no anno-
tated GO term (i.e., t¼0) is 6.79% (¼47/692) and 21.2% (¼181/852),
where 6.5% (¼47/692) and 18.3% (¼181/852) of proteins without
homologies are included in the ESL and PSL datasets, respectively.
Speciﬁcally, the percentage 14.52% (¼27/186) in the positive dataset
Fig. 2. Accuracy performance with different number of homologies. The highest
accuracies 90.6% and 85.7% are obtained by using k-NN with k¼1 and h¼5 for ESL
and PSL, respectively.

Among the independent dataset test, sub-sampling or N-fold
(e.g., 5- or 10-fold) cross-validation test, and jackknife test, which
are often used for examining the accuracy of a statistical predic-
tion method (Chou and Zhang, 1995), the jackknife test was
deemed the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result
for a given benchmark dataset (Chou, 2011). Therefore, the jack-
knife test has been increasingly recognized and widely adopted to
various prediction methods (Cai et al., 2005; Chou and Cai, 2005a;
Chou and Shen, 2006a, 2006b, 2007, 2010a, 2010b; Chou et al.,
2011, 2012; Shen and Chou, 2010). When using the jackknife test
like Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (Chou and Shen, 2010a) and Gneg-mPLoc
(Shen and Chou, 2010), the high dimensional (n¼60,020) GO term
feature vector is actually necessary for a universal representation
of the protein sequences. Conversely, this work calculates scores
of GO terms and thus identiﬁes a small set of m GO terms.
Consequently, 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) is adopted as done
by many investigators with SVM as the prediction engine, where
m5n.
In addition to the overall accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN) and
speciﬁcity (SP) are also widely used performance evaluation
parameters, and are derived as follows:
ACC ¼ ðqcþscÞ=ðqcþscþucþocÞ ð3Þ
SN¼ qc=ðqcþocÞ ð4Þ
SP¼ sc=ðucþscÞ ð5Þ
where qc is the number of sequences of class c that are predicted
correctly, sc is the number of sequences not in class c that
are predicted correctly, uc is the number of under-predicted
sequences, and oc is the number of over-predicted sequences.
Additionally, the value of the Matthews correlation coefﬁcient
(MCC) is also recorded (Matthews, 1975), belonging to [1,1].
A coefﬁcient of 1.0 is a perfect prediction; 0 represents an average
random prediction, and 1.0 represents an inverse prediction.
The MCC value is deﬁned as follows (Ferreira and Azevedo, 2007;
Matthews, 1975):

2.5. Prediction of query sequences
The proposed SVM-based classiﬁer uses an m-dimensional
feature vector as input to implement the prediction system.
Parameter settings of the SVM are determined in the training
phase. The block diagram shows that the input of this prediction
system is a secretory protein sequence P with FASTA format. The
output is the predicted non-classical secretion. The prediction
procedure is as follows.
Step 1: For the query sequence P, BLAST with (h, e)¼(5, 109)
is utilized with the Swiss-Prot database to obtain homologies
with known accession numbers for secretory proteins in
eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Step 2: The obtained accession numbers are used to retrieve
their annotated GO terms from the GO database. Let the total
number of GO terms obtained be j.
Step 3: Conﬁrm whether each j GO term exists in the m
features of GO terms. If the jth GO term is in the set of m GO
terms, then element ciG¼1 (Eq. (2)); otherwise, ciG¼0, where
i¼1, 2,y, m.
For the query protein sequence, when no of the j GO terms
belongs to the set of m top-ranked GO terms or no homologies are
obtained, this Sec-GO method simple predicts the query protein
with non-classical secretion under concerning the possibility of non-
classical secretion annotated by GO is larger than that of classical
secretion in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Tables 4 and 5). For
example, only 6.8% (¼(45þ2)/692) of the proteins in the ESL
dataset are represented for zero vectors, whereas 45 proteins have
no homologies and two proteins are not annotated by the m top-
ranked GO terms.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparison of other feature types
This proposed Sec-GO method is implemented by using SVM
with a set of m top-ranked GO term features. Figs. 3 and 4 show
two sets of m¼501 and 158 GO terms are identiﬁed; their
correlated training accuracies are 96.2% and 93.7% for the ESL
and PSL datasets, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
GO terms used in Sec-GO, the SVM with three additional feature
sets—20 AAC features (SVM-AAC), 531 PCP features (SVM-PCP),
and PSSM (SVM-PSSM)—are individually evaluated in terms of
the prediction accuracy of 10-CV using two ESL and PSL datasets.
The 531 PCP features are derived from the 20 physicochemical
properties of AAindex (Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000) by aver-
aging over the entire protein sequence (Huang et al., 2007; Hung
et al., 2010). The PSSM proﬁle along with compositional attributes
and similarity search based information are generated using
PSI-BLAST (Garg and Raghava, 2008).
The best values of parameters g and C in the SVM-based
classiﬁers were determined using a step-wise approach from
Fig. 4. Accuracy performance for all sets of m GO terms: (a) the highest accuracy 96.2% is obtained by using m¼501 GO terms with SVM on ESL dataset, where each of the
501 GO terms has a score Z0.009 (the mean score). (b) For PSL, the m¼158 GO terms with SVM can yield the best accuracy 93.7%. Each of the 501 GO terms has a score
Z0.0138 (the mean score).

(Kandaswamy et al., 2010) to evaluate these 19 proteins. Predic-
tion results (Table 11) show that Sec-GO correctly predicts 18
proteins, which is better than SPRED (15), SecretomeP 2.0 (12)
and SRTpred (5).
3.4. Discussion
For those who do not really understand GO, it may be of help
to carefully read an incisive analysis elaborated in Chou and Shen
(2006b). For reader0s convenience, some of its key points are
summarized as follows:
(1) Since the GO database was established according to the
molecular function, biological process, and cellular compo-
nent, when a protein already has a GO annotation, why does
one need to predict its biological function, pathway, and
subcellular localization, which are merely different names
for molecular function, biological process, and cellular com-
ponent, respectively?
Although the GO database is constructed based on protein
function and cellular component, for those proteins with the
annotation of ‘‘subcellular location unknown’’ in the Swiss-
Prot database, most (499%) of their corresponding GO terms
in the GO database are also annotated with ‘‘cellular compo-
nent unknown’’ (Chou and Shen, 2006b).
(2) Is it merely a procedure for converting GO annotations from
one format into another?
Even for those proteins whose secretions are clearly anno-
tated in the Swiss-Prot database, their corresponding GO
terms in the GO database do not always directly indicate
their corresponding non-classical secretion function.
(3) Is the high success rate obtained via the proposed GO
approach merely due to a trivial utilization of annotations in
the GO database?
Importantly, only GO numbers of a query protein, not its GO
annotations, are used, which is similar to using all other pre-
dictors in identifying subcellular localization, in that only the
sequence of a query protein, not its Swiss-Prot annotation, is
used. Accordingly, when BLAST is used to ﬁnd homologies for
non-classical secretion prediction, only 45.2% and 46.0% of true
predictions are obtained according to the homologies’ subcellular
location annotations for the ESL and PSL datasets, respectively.

Abstract— Bioluminescence proteins are becoming increasingly 
important in a variety of research fields such as in situ imaging 
and the study of protein-protein interactions in vivo, and 
increased spectral variety of bioluminescent reporters is needed 
for further progress. The existing method BLProt using support 
vector machine (SVM) and physicochemical properties to predict 
bioluminescence proteins.  The BLProt method identified the 
most prominent features using various filter approaches, ReliefF, 
infogain, and mRMR. BLProt utilized 100 features to achieve a 
training accuracy of 80% and test accuracy of 80.06%. 
Physicochemical properties are well recognized to be effective in 
designing various predictors for understanding the functions and 
characteristics of proteins. In this study, we propose an efficient 
method for designing predictors of bioluminescence proteins 
using a small set of informative physicochemical properties 
obtained by using an inheritable bi-objective genetic algorithm. 
The benchmark datasets were used to evaluate the proposed 
method using SVM and informative physicochemical properties 
as the features. The prediction accuracy of independent test is 
81.79% using 15 properties. From the analysis of informative 
physicochemical properties, some knowledge of bioluminescent 
problems can be revealed. The proposed physicochemical 
property mining method can be used conveniently as the core for 
designing predictors for various types of bioluminescent

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Bioluminescence is a light producing process. The basic 
two factors included in this process are luciferase and 
luciferin, which are the catalytic enzyme and its substrate 
respectively. Work on bioluminescence is actively pursued at 
all levels, such as naturalist or phtochemist, due to it abnormal 
characters. The visible light, generated from luciferase, is 
emitted at room temperature while light often can be generated 
at extreme high temperature causing violent oxidation of some 
objects. The actual emission of bioluminescence is the 
extremely rapid final process of usually multistep reaction. 
Most often, the excited state of luciferin is excited by electron 
or photon [1].   
Bioluminescence provides an ideal tool to solve scientific 
problems. Previous studies [2] are already renowned for the 
preparation and application of an extended series of 
radiometric ion-sensitive indicators and a number of 
sophisticated reporter molecules based on fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer (FRET). In order to generate 
genetically encoded FRET probes which are suitable for 
radiometric measurements, more fluorophores are need to be 
discovered or generated. 
However, the biofunction of those bioluminescence 
proteins are quite alike, they do not share strongly 
homologous. Many orgasms use different proteins which have 
different mechanisms to generate light [3]. Bioluminescence 
proteins are becoming increasingly important in a variety of 
research fields such as in situ imaging and the study of 
protein-protein interactions in vivo, and increased spectral 
variety of bioluminescent reporters is needed for further 
progress.  
Beside the bioluminescent characters, some characters are 
also interesting. First, the luciferins are extremely hydrophobic 
macro molecules. To catalyze the molecules, the catalytic sites 
must be very different to tune the catalytic orientation between 
the enzymes and subtracts. Secondly, the bioluminescence 
light in some live orgasms, like firefly, is regulated. The GFP 
does not have a significant regulation structure like the C-
terminal ball-chain structure of voltage-dependent gate 
channel on neuron. But some regulation mechanisms still 
occur for this purpose [4]. Third, the bioluminescence does not 
share homologous but they have a similar function. 
Understanding physicochemical properties of the 
bioluminescence proteins may help improve the applications 
of bioluminescence proteins. 
Kandaswamy et al. [5] proposed an accurate prediction 
method BLProt that uses a support vector machine (SVM) and 
physicochemical properties to predict bioluminescence 
proteins. BLProt used a training dataset consisting of 300 
bioluminescence proteins and 300 non-bioluminescence 
proteins, and an independent test dataset consisting of 141 
bioluminescence proteins and 18202 non-bioluminescence 
proteins. To identify the most prominent features, they carried 
out feature selection with three different filter approaches, 
ReliefF, infogain, and mRMR. For the aim of designing 
accurate prediction methods, the major concern is to identify 
feature vectors with high discrimination abilities for 
classifying positive and negative samples. Their feature 
selection method suffers from a large set of candidate features. 
We investigate the optimal design of predictors for 
978-1-61284-101-4/12/$26.00 ©2012 IEEE40
discrimination in this paper. The GA-chromosome consists of 
n=531 binary GA-genes bi for selecting informative properties 
and two 4-bit GA-genes for tuning the parameters C and γ of 
SVM. If bi=0, the ith property is excluded from the SVM 
classifier; otherwise, the ith property is included. This encoding 
method maps the 16 values of γ and C into {2-7, 2-6…, 28}.  
The feature vector for training the SVM classifier is 
obtained from decoding a GA-chromosome using the 
following steps. Consider a given DNA-PBs sequence. At 
first, the index vectors for all selected physicochemical 
properties are constructed from AAindex for each amino acid. 
Feature vector of a peptide consists of the selected features 
whose values are obtained by averaging the values in their 
corresponding index vectors. Finally, all values of the feature 
vectors are normalized into [-1, 1] for applying SVM. 
Fitness function is the only guide for IBCGA to obtain 
desirable solutions. The fitness function of IBCGA is the 5-
CV overall accuracy. IBCGA with the fitness function f(X) 
can simultaneously obtain a set of solutions, Xr, where r=rstart, 
rstart+1, …, rend in a single run. The algorithm of IBCGA with 
the given values rstart and rend is described as follows: 
Step 1) (Initiation) Randomly generate an initial population 
of Npop individuals. All the n binary GA-genes have r 
1’s and n-r 0’s where r = rstart. 
Step 2) (Evaluation) Evaluate the fitness values of all 
individuals using f(X). 
Step 3) (Selection) Use the traditional tournament selection 
that selects the winner from two randomly selected 
individuals to form a mating pool. 
Step 4) (Crossover) Select pc ·Npop parents from the mating 
pool to perform orthogonal array crossover on the 
selected pairs of parents where pc is the crossover 
probability. 
Step 5) (Mutation) Apply the swap mutation operator to the 
randomly selected pm · Npop individuals in the new 
population where pm is the mutation probability. To 
prevent the best fitness value from deteriorating, 
mutation is not applied to the best individual. 
Step 6) (Termination test) If the stopping condition for 
obtaining the solution Xr is satisfied, output the best 
individual as Xr. Otherwise, go to Step 2). In this 
study, the stopping condition is to perform 40 
generations. 
Step 7) (Inheritance) If r < rend, randomly change one bit in 
the binary GA-genes for each individual from 0 to 1; 
increase the number r by one, and go to Step 2). 
Otherwise, stop the algorithm. 
D. Prediction Method PBLP 
The selected m physicochemical properties and the 
associated parameter set of SVM by using PBPL are used to 
implement the computational system and analyze the 
physicochemical properties to further understand the BLPs. 
Since the PBPL is a non-deterministic method, it should make 
more effort to identify an efficient and robust feature set of 
informative physicochemical properties in five aspects. The 
procedure is as the following steps: 
 
Step 1 : We prepare the independent data sets where each set 
is used as the training data set of 5-CV. 
Step 2 : PBPL is performed R independent runs for each of 
independent data sets. In this study, R = 30. There are 
total 30 sets of m physicochemical properties for each 
of independent data sets.  
Step 3 : Choose the set of selected physicochemical properties 
with a maximal accuracy.   
 
PBLDs will automatically determine a set of informative 
physicochemical properties and an SVM-model for prediction 
bioluminescent and non- bioluminescence proteins. 
 
III. RESULTS 
A. Results of training and test datasets  
The training data sets contain 300 positive and 300 
negative samples. The sequence similarity of the training data 
set is smaller than 40%. We performed 30 independent runs of 
PBPL to select robust feature set which could improve the 
performance of SVM classifier on discriminating the two 
classes of proteins. The highest training accuracy of 30 PBPL 
runs was 84.11% and its corresponding test accuracy was 
81.79%. (Table 2).

BLProt and PBLP. 
 
B. Selected a small set of physicochemical properties. 
The quantified effectiveness of individual physicochemical 
properties on prediction is useful to characterize the PBLP 
mechanism by physicochemical properties. Orthogonal 
experimental design with factor analysis can be used to 
estimate the individual effects of physicochemical properties 
according to the value of main effect difference (MED) [7, 12]. 
The property with the largest value of MED is the most 
effective in predicting BLPs. 
According to MED, the 15 informative properties are 
ranked and their descriptions are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. 
The most effective property with MED=16.16668 is

A. Results of training and test datasets  
The training data sets contain 300 positive and 300 
negative samples. The sequence similarity of the training data 
set is smaller than 40%. We performed 30 independent runs of 
PBPL to select robust feature set which could improve the 
performance of SVM classifier on discriminating the two 
classes of proteins. The highest training accuracy of 30 PBPL 
runs was 84.11% and its corresponding test accuracy was 
81.79%. (Table 2).  
 
Table 2. Results of the training and independent test by 
BLProt and PBLP. 
 
B. Selected a small set of physicochemical properties. 
The quantified effectiveness of individual physicochemical 
properties on prediction is useful to characterize the PBLP 
mechanism by physicochemical properties. Orthogonal 
experimental design with factor analysis can be used to 
estimate the individual effects of physicochemical properties 
according to the value of main effect difference (MED) [7, 12]. 
The property with the largest value of MED is the most 
effective in predicting BLPs. 
According to MED, the 15 informative properties are 
ranked and their descriptions are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. 
The most effective property with MED=16.16668 is 
RACS820111 denoting “Differential geometry and polymer 
conformation. Conformational and nucleation properties of 
individual amino acids”.
