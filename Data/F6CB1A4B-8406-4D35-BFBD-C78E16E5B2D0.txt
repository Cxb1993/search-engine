studied using the angular dependent Raman 
spectroscopy both theoretically and 
experimentally. The polarized Raman 
scattering spectra were recorded from the 
cross-section of c-axis oriented GaN films as 
a function of the angle between the 
polarization direction of the incident laser 
and the film normal direction in three 
different polarization configurations, the 
perpendicular, parallel, and un-polarized 
configuration. The Raman intensity of A1(TO) 
showed a sinusoidal dependence on the 
rotating angle, as did the E1(TO) mode. The 
theoretical fit is weighed in the susceptibility 
contribution and the phase differential of the 
different vibrating elements. The intensity of 
E2 is quite different to the A1 and E1, because 
E2 mode has the same vibrating elements but 
the A1 and E1 have two types of the elements 
and will have the phase differential 
contributing to the susceptibility of the 
polarized angle. This combination 
investigation of experiments and theory can 
also be applied to other non-cubic types of 
wide energy gap semiconductors and other 
materials and therefore, it has opened a good 
Raman application field for materials. 
 
3) Rapid thermal annealing effects on the 
structural and optical properties of ZnO films 
deposited on Si substrates [3] 
 In this research work, the structural and 
optical properties of ZnO films deposited on 
Si substrate following rapid thermal 
annealing (RTA) have been investigated by 
X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force 
microscopy (AFM), and photoluminescence 
(PL) measurements. After RTA treatment, 
the XRD spectra have shown an effective 
relaxation of the residual compressive stress, 
an increase of the intensity and narrowing of 
the full- width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 
the (002) diffraction peak of the as-grown 
ZnO film. AFM images show roughening of 
the film surface due to increase of grain size 
after RTA. The PL spectrum reveals a 
significant improvement in the UV 
luminescence of ZnO films following RTA at 
800 oC for 1 min. 
 
4) Temperature dependent and time-resolved 
photoluminescence studies of InAs 
self-assembled quantum dots with InGaAs strain 
reducing layer structure [4]  
 In this study, we have grown four types 
of InAs self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) 
by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). A thin 
InGaAs stained reducing layer (SRL) is 
adopted to investigate the influence of strain 
to QDs and extend the emission wavelength 
to 1.3 µm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
measurements show that the SRL can release 
the strain between wetting layer (WL) and 
quantum dots, and then enlarge size of 
quantum dots. As the thickness of InAs layer 
decreases, the QDs with the SRL are chained 
to strings and have a significant increase in 
density, which leads to a abnormal red-shift 
of the 1.3 µm photoluminescence (PL) peak 
at room temperature (RT). PL peaks of InAs 
quantum dots with the SRL show red-shift 
compared with the quantum dots directly 
deposited on GaAs matrix. We study 
systematically the dependence of PL lifetime 
on the QDs size, density and temperature (T). 
We observe that the PL lifetime of quantum 
dots is insensitive to T below 50 K, increases 
till a temperature point TC, and then drop 
with temperature. The values of TC are 
related with the SRL and the thickness of 
InAs. We have also observed an obvious 
red-shift at low T as the measuring time 
delay. The PL lifetime of quantum dots with 
the SRL is less than those without the SRL 
and the QDs with different densities have 
different PL lifetime dependence on the QDs 
size. We explained these measuring results 
from the competition between the carriers 
redistribution and thermal emission. 
 
5) Suppression of Phase Separation in InGaN 
layers Grown on Lattice Matched ZnO 
Substrates [5] 
 In this investigation, InGaN layers were 
grown on standard (0002) GaN 
template/sapphire and (0001) ZnO substrates 
by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. 
These two substrates exhibited two distinct 
states of strain relaxation, which have direct 
effects on phase separation. InGaN with 32% 
indium exhibited phase separation when 
grown on sapphire. Sapphire samples were 
 6 
decreases with the decrease in temperature. 
Compared with the QDs directly deposited 
on GaAs, the QDs grown on SRL have a 
larger PL lifetime below 50 K, but up 50 k, it 
is the reverse condition. PL lifetime 
increasing with temperature can be attributed 
to several mechanisms, such as more carriers 
migration from barriers and WL (Wetting 
layer) to the QDs, thermally induced carrier 
redistribution among the different QDs, the 
thermally induced population of dark 
excitons, and the thermally induced reduction 
of the effective oscillator by the carrier 
expansion. Thermal emission and the 
non-radiative recombination reduce the PL 
lifetime above TC. We have observed the 
QDs with different densities have the 
different size-dependent PL lifetime, which 
can be explained by the competition of the 
exciton wave function overlap between 
intra-dots and inter-dots. 
9) Optical and structural properties of dual 
wavelength InGaN/GaN multiple quantum 
well light emitting diodes [9],  
 In this research, we have studied two 
InGaN/GaN MQW LED samples, consisting 
of the so-called Charge Asymmetric 
Resonance Tunneling (CART) structure, with 
different growth temperature, and explored 
the influence of growth temperature of the 
well on the structural and optical properties. 
From the result of HRTEM, we can observe 
that there are obvious quantum wells with 8 
periods. Besides, the PL spectrums show that 
the emission wavelength shift toward the side 
of long wavelength (red shifts) due to lower 
growth temperature. The deposition 
(composition) of Indium is better (higher) 
than the higher growth temperature, and 
furthermore the activation energy 
(localization depth) is relatively higher 
(deeper). In order to obtain the specific 
emission wavelength in the LED industries, 
we can adjust the flow rate of TEGa and 
TMIn, and the temperature and time of 
growth. In this paper, we draw our attention 
to the growing temperature of quantum wells. 
Actually, the appropriate growth temperature 
is needed to achieve required emissive 
wavelength. The deposition of Indium is 
unable to be formed below the proper 
temperature, and also melt easily with GaN 
(exceeding 9000C) above the proper 
temperature. Therefore, the radiative lifetime 
at the low-energy side of the InGaN peaks is 
longer, activation energy is bigger; the 
Stokes’ shift is bigger and has a deeper 
localization depth for higher indium. Second, 
in order to obtain the specific emission 
wavelength in the LED industries, we can 
adjust modifiable-CART InGaN/GaN MQWs 
and active- MQWs structure. This 
investigation is helpful to better understand 
the luminescent mechanisms and find ways 
to further improve the material design and 
growth of InGaN/GaN MQWs for the wide 
spectral LED applications. 
10) Surface and Material Characteristics of 
Ga2O3 Thin Films on GaAs [10] 
In this work, properties of dielectric 
Ga2O3 films deposited on the GaAs substrate 
have been studied. Thin-film properties 
including stoichiometry, microstructure, 
phase, homogeneity, uniformity, and 
temperature integrity as well as optical 
characteristics make these films well suited 
for electronic and optoelectronic applications. 
From the XPS measurement, we can know 
that the Ga 3d core level spectra has two 
peaks, one at 19.4 eV (Ga bonded as GaAs), 
and the other at 21 eV (Ga bonded to oxygen). 
And the binding energies which are bounded 
as Ga2O3 have been known. Furthermore, 
EDX measures the relative proportions of Ga 
and O by calculating a weighted ratio of the 
characteristic x-ray fluorescence peak 
intensities belonging to each element. It tells 
us the proportions of Ga and O are changed 
after annealing and the oxygen components 
are higher as the annealing temperature is 
high. It also can explaine the phenomenon in 
the XPS experiment. The components of 
oxygen increased in gallium oxide resulted in 
the binding energy increase. Finally, we 
identify the quality of samples from XRD 
experiment and find out database to identify 
which signals are produced from Ga2O3 and 
which signals are produced from GaAs. The 
peaks of Kα1 and Kα2 are getting larger; the 
FWHMs of Kα1 and Kα2 are getting smaller.

ABSTRACT 
Dual wavelength InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs with 
Charge Asymmetric Resonance Tunneling (CART) 
structure have been grown on sapphire by 
MOCVD and studied by high-resolution transmis-
sion electron microscopy (HRTEM), high- resolu-
tion X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), temperature de-
pendent photoluminescence (PL), photolumines-
cence excitation (PLE) and time-resolved photo-
luminescence (TRPL). Their unique structural and 
optical properties are reported and discussed.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
GaN based III-nitride semiconductors, possessing 
large direct band gaps, extremely high hardness, 
very large heterojunction offsets, high thermal 
conductivity, high melting temperature, and great 
breakthroughs, have been in recent years 
achieved much in applications for light emitting 
diodes (LEDs), laser diode (LDs) and other opto-
electronic and electronic devices [1–2]. Recently, a 
new type of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well 
(MQW) light emitting diodes (LEDs), consisting of 
the so-called Charge Asymmetric Resonance 
Tunneling (CART) structure, has been reported, 
which can emit dual wavelength lights and expect 
to have better device performance [3]. In this arti-
cle, we reported on the metalorganic chemical va-
por deposition (MOCVD) and investigation of In-
GaN/GaN CART MQW LEDs grown on sapphire 
with dual wavelength emissions. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Two typical samples are studied, both consisting of 
six periods of CART InGaN wells with 3.3 nm 
thickness and with 8.5 nm thickness of GaN barrier, 
respectively, and two periods of InGaN wells with 2 
nm thickness of 7 nm GaN barrier with different 
well growth-temperature of 7970C and 7820C, re-
spectively. Figure 1 shows their structures. 
 
A variety of materials characterization and optical 
techniques are employed to study these MQW 
LED wafers with distinguishing features.

integrated PL intensity for the QW-related PL 
emission over the T-range in 15-300K, for blue 
emissions (left）and yellow-green emissions (right). 
The best fit obtained by using equation (2), giving 
the activation energies for GF3 of 48.3 meV (blue) 
and 51.2 meV (green), and for GF195 of 59.4 meV 
(blue) and for 67.1 meV (yellow), respectively.  
 
It has been suggested that the measured activa-
tion energy Ea in MQW samples represents the 
localization energies of excitons, resulting from 
band edge fluctuations. Generally, the quenching 
of the luminescence with T can be explained by 
thermal emission of the carriers out of a confining 
potential with an activation energy correlated with 
the depth of the confining potential. So we can in-
fer that the lower growth-T in the deposition (com-
position) of Indium is better (higher) and leads to 
higher localization effect owing to the formation of 
In-rich QDs structure.

It is seen that the Stokes’ shift of the blue part 
emission is smaller than the green part, which is 
due to the energy transference. It is also seen, the 
Stokes’ shift as higher, which is consistent with the 
large value of Ea associated with the strong local-
ization of the carriers in this MQWs structure. Fur-
ther, larger Stokes’ shift of green part emission, 
than blue part, indicates deeper localization of 
green part, inferring higher Indium composition of 
green part. From the PLE result, we can generally 
infer this MQW LED structure, the six periods of 
InGaN/GaN QWs (blue part) are used to collect 
carriers, which then transfer to active InGaN/GaN 
QWs (green part) to enhance the strong emission.

and 590 nm (2.101 eV), respectively. In order to 
avoid the laser response, we let the fitting begin at 
about 2 ns.

Abstract  
Raman scattering and polarization-dependent synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption, in 
combination, have been employed to examine the residual stress of undoped GaN epitaxial 
layers grown on Si by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and Si-doped n-type GaN layers grown 
on sapphire by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with the carrier 
concentration of 2.2 × 1018 – 6 × 1018 cm–3. Values of the lattice constant of different GaN 
films can be deduced from the interatomic distances in the second coordination shell around 
Ga by polarization-dependent extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis and 
the strain of the films can be obtained. This result is further confirmed by Raman scattering 
spectra in which the phonon modes show a significant shift between different GaN epitaxial 
layers with different growth conditions.

according to the change of the bond length due to residual strains. Therefore, both techniques 
can provide complementary information to reveal the local variation of stress in epilayers, 
which is quite unique among all currently available tools.

Raman scattering spectra were recorded by a Jobin-Yvon T64000 triple spectrometer 
equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charged-coupled device (CCD) detector at room 
temperature in the backscattering geometry. A Si sample is used to calibrate the system..The 
excitation laser source with a wavelength of 514.5 nm at a power of 100 mW was used and 
the spectral resolution was less than 0.5 cm−1. The spot size of the laser beam was first 
measured with a micrometer, which is around 1 µm, and the power across the light spot 
approximately forms a Gaussion distribution.  
X-ray absorption fine-structure spectra were collected for the GaN
 
samples (list in Table 
1) at Ga K-edges in X-ray fluorescence yield mode at beamline 17C and N K-edges in 
total-electron yield mode at beamline 20A of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research 
Center (NSRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. All measurements were made at room temperature. 
Polarization XAFS were operated at 15° and 90° which is the angle between the the sample 
surface and the X-ray direction. The incident photon flux (I0) was monitored simultaneously 
by a Ni mesh located after the exit slit of the monochromator. All X-ray absorption spectra 
were normalized to I0.

from the difference spectra, which has been reported by M. Katiskini et al. [8], the anisotropic 
characteristic of p-orbital can be easily observed.

3.3 EXAFS 
Polarization dependent EXAFS studies were performed for all samples at the Ga K-edge. 
The fitting of polarized spectra in the wurtzite structure raises some specific issues which we 
now address, distinguishing between the first and the second shell. In the plane-wave 
approximation the weight can be attributed to the structural signal due to an atom pair 
oriented at an angle φ with the photon polarization vector is 3cos2φ. However, the splitting in 
the first shell is very small, ~0.007 Å, and we have not been able to detect any significant 
difference either in the simulated signals or in the average first shell distance measured in the 
two geometries. Consequently, we have always fitted the Ga-N first shell with a single 
contribution. The Ga-Ga second shell is, in contrast, strongly influenced by the polarization 
geometry, and indeed it is the value of the second shell distances that provide us with 
information on the strain in the GaN epilayer since they have a simple relation to the in-plane 
and out-of-plane lattice parameters, a and c. In fact, in bulk GaN, six Ga atoms lie in the same 
(0001) basal plane as the central atom at a distance.

3.4 Strain 
3.4.1 Strain determination from extended X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy 
As Table 4 shown, the lattice constants a and c can be obtained from the interatomic

and (5). Further, the values of strain can be derived from the following equations.

Here, a and c are the strained lattice constants of GaN and a0 , c0 are reference values for 
stoichiometric and defect-free GaN crystals. To calculate these strains, the lattice constants a0 
and c0 of the relaxed, unstrained bulk material must be known. Due to our lack of bulk GaN, 
the reliable reported values are used with a0 = 3.1878 and c0=5.1850 Å [15]. The results are 
listed in Table 5.

4. Conclusion 
MOCVD grown Si-doped GaN and MBE grown undoped GaN have been studied by 
combined Raman scattering and X-ray absorption fine structure. The X-ray absorption near 
edge structure (XANES) can prove the isotropic characteristic of p-orbital and due to the 
information depth the effect of Si doping in the GaN films can be seen obviously from the 
variation of the XANES peaks which was measured under the grazing incidence. Besides, the 
spatial correlation model was used to fit the Raman E2 mode for the measured GaN samples. 
The further work is under way to study the relationship between fitting results and growth 
parameters, which is hopeful to help to optimize the growth parameters and obtain the 
relationship between the GaN film crystalline quality and the doping level. Moreover, values 
of the lattice constant of different GaN films can be deduced from the interatomic distances in 
the second coordination shell around Ga by polarization-dependent extended X-ray absorption 
fine structure (EXAFS) analysis and the strain of the films can be obtained. This result is 
further confirmed by Raman scattering spectra in which the phonon modes show a significant

ABSTRACT 
Silicon Carbide (SiC) based devices have been of technical importance for high temperature, high 
frequency, and high power electronic devices. A series of N-doped n-type 6H-SiC bulk wafers are studied. 
Interesting results are obtained and discussed. We have employed Raman scattering technique in 
combination with the Tender X-ray (around 1700eV) absorption spectroscopy measurements to perform a 
penetrating analysis on these SiC materials. The synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray absorption fine-structure 
(XAFS) spectroscopy technology was successfully used to investigate silicon K-edge absorption spectra for 
this series of 6H-SiC. The XAFS spectroscopy that we measured can yields information on the local 
structure around specific atoms in solids with element resolution. Their Fourier transform spectra, analyzed 
by a specific program, and simulation can yield the bond length between Si-C and Si-Si. The relationship 
between growth condition and bond length of SiC could be established. Raman scattering in combination 
with high energy and high intensity synchrotron radiation technology is approved to be a powerful tool for 
materials fundamental research on wide band gap semiconductors, and it can play an important rule to 
promote research in the field.

They are nitrogen doped n-type with different values of resistivity and concentration, as listed in Table 1.  
Raman spectroscopy was performed by J.Y. (Jobin Yvon) T6400 Raman system and under excitation 
of 514 nm at room temperature. The laser power is controlled at 200mW. And the XAFS spectroscopy was 
measured in National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Result and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows the Raman spectra which are employed by the JY T6400, 514nm. As shown, the 
significant change in three transverse optical (TO) mode peak with different samples is not obvious. But the 
longitudinal optical (LO0) signal shift a little toward high frequency with the increase of N dopings. While 
the FWHM (Full-Width Half-Maximum) of LO0 mode is getting broaden. The FWHM of LO mode 
increase from 4.596 cm-1 of 6H9 to 8.261 cm-1 of 6H1 as listed in Table 2. We believed that it is arisen from 
the amorphous Si-Si vibration, indicating a slight damage of crystalline structure from the heavy N-doping.

peak tells us that the position of reflective wave from the nearest atoms, C here. Second peak which is at 
around 2.7 Angstrom means the second reflective wave from next nearest atoms, Si. By the fitting process 
from the specific software, the bond length between the absorbing atom and its near atoms could be 
simulated, as list in table 3. From table 3, the change of bond length is obviously observed. The bond length 
of Si-C is going to decrease as the doping concentration increases. In figure 5, the relationship of Si-C bond 
length and doping concentration is shown combined with the polynomial curve fitting. It is reported that in 
nitrogen doped 6H-SiC, the carbon atoms are going to be replaced by the nitrogen atoms [6]. And from the 
literature [7], the bond length of Si-N is smaller then Si-C in nitrogen doping of 6H-SiC. It indicates that 
the bond length is around 1.74 Angstrom for Si-N and 1.89 Angstrom for Si-C. And this result is in good 
agreement with our research. The decrease of Si-C bond length is attributed by the replacement from C into 
N. And further research evidence work is needed. But in the Si-Si bond length, the change of bond length 
becomes not so obvious. It indicates that the doping concentration is still not heavy enough to influence the 
whole structure, only at local area.

Conclusion 
 The Raman and XAFS spectroscopy are combined to analyze a series of N-doped n-type 6H-SiC bulk 
wafer. The first order Raman transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes can be 
detected at same runs at room temperature by using a high sensitive microscopic system. Synchrotron 
Radiation X-ray absorption fine-structure has been proved to be a strong spectroscopic analysis technique 
for the structure information from material. The tender x-ray (around 1700eV) absorption spectroscopy for 
Silicon K-edge x-ray absorption measurements were employed in NSRRC, Taiwan.
