morphology and microstructure of condensed carbon deposits and their formation mechanism in the 
combustion environment.  
The SEM, TEM, HR-TEM and EDS images show that carbon nanotubes and carbon 
nano-spheres are successfully synthesized at suitable operating conditions. Many carbon 
nanotubes are harvested in the soot zone of flame whose temperature range is about 750-1250℃. 
Curved and entangled tubular multi-walled canbon nanotubes are found, which have only typical 
straight tubular structures. In addition to curved CNTs, a small amount of helically coiled tubular 
CNTs are also synthesized when the sampling position is located at a distance of 1.5-2 mm from 
the soot zone where the temperature is about 1048-1082℃. However, carbon nano-spheres can 
be observed only at higher height above of burner (i.e. 15 and 10 mm) and higher methane 
concentration, 30%, for fixed ethylene concentration, 5%. The temperature range of carbon 
nano-spheres formation is around 1000  and 1300℃ -1400℃. It is of interests to note that the 
formation zones of carbon nanotubes and carbon nano-spheres are different although they can be 
synthesized at the same operating conditions.

1. 前言 
1985年Kroto等人[1]發現碳六十的存在並提出足球模型來解釋其結構，此後即對碳化合
物的研究有著重大突破。1991年日本NEC資深研究員飯島澄男(Sumio Iijima)[2]在以電弧放
電法製備碳六十時，偶然發現奈米碳管的(Carbon Nanotube)存在。自碳六十和奈米碳管發
現以來，近年來不同形貌和結構的奈米碳結構(Carbon Nanomaterials)也陸續被學者發現。奈
米碳結構主要包括：碳六十、奈米碳管、奈米碳球(Carbon Nanocapsule)…等。由於奈米碳
結構具有特異的結構和奇特的物理、化學、機械和光電等特性，其廣泛應用的前景備受人
們的關注，並因此迅速在世界上掀起一股研究的熱潮。 
奈米碳結構的合成需要三大要素，亦即碳源、熱源和金屬觸媒(催化劑)。奈米碳結構的
製備技術主要有電弧放電法[3]、雷射氣化法[4]、化學氣相沈積法(CVD)[5]等，這些方法都
有產量少且價格昂貴的缺點。新近的火焰合成法[6]，利用火焰燃燒提供高溫環境，碳氫化
合物燃料提供碳源，只需再加入適當的金屬觸媒，即可提供合成奈米碳結構所需的三要素，
且火焰合成法反應快速，只要找出適當的合成條件即可大量生產奈米碳結構，因此本研究
希望能找出合成奈米碳結構的燃料種類、溫度、催化劑等最佳條件，進而尋找簡單且能大
量生產奈米碳結構材料之方法。目前火焰合成法，可分為預混火焰合成法和擴散火焰合成
法兩類。 
2000年Vander Wal等人[7]使用標準噴流擴散火焰合成奈米碳管，研究中以乙烯氣、乙
炔氣添加氮氣作為稀釋氣，在同軸噴流燃燒器內管通入燃料，外管通入氧化劑產生標準擴
散火焰，研究中認為奈米碳管合成有下列步驟：(1)金屬物質分解形成奈米金屬顆粒；(2)碳
氫化合物沉澱並分解於奈米金屬顆粒上；(3)碳原子擴散聚集到金屬顆粒上並促進形成奈米
碳管。

表 Y04 
簡述如下： 
This contribution provides a review of crucial topics in theoretical research on electrochemical 
materials for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, arising at scales from Ångstroms to meters. It focuses 
on structures, properties, and operation of proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membranes and 
of catalyst layers. The insights from theory and modeling can advise us how fuel cell components 
with optimal specifications could be made and how they can be integrated into fuel cells. The 
themes addressed include self-organization phenomena in complex media, proton conduction
phenomena in hydrated polymer electrolytes, effective properties of random heterogeneous media, 
distribution and transport of water in various components and at various scales, and performance in 
the working fuel cell. The two common threads of these themes are the pivotal role of water for 
structure formation and operation of fuel cell materials and the wide range of scales that determines 
structure vs. property relations.

ABSTRACT 
An experimental study was conducted to 
investigate the effects of acoustic excitation and inert 
dilution on the flame structure near the nozzle exit in a 
jet diffusion flame at low exit velocities. Pure ethylene 
or the mixture of ethylene and nitrogen was 
introduced into a straight copper tube long enough to 
produce a diffusion flame with a fully-developed 
velocity profile at the tube exit. The diffusion flame 
was then acoustically modulated to observe changes 
in the flame structure. The acoustic excitation 
frequency was varied from 0 (unexcited) to 90 Hz. No 
matter the fuel gas (ethylene) with or without inert 
dilution, as the excitation frequency approached the 
resonant frequency (66 Hz), the flame structure was 
dramatically changed from single-flame structure to 
double-flame structure and the yellow flame near the 
burner exit became much more luminous. At the 
resonant frequency, the radius of the inner flame was 
reduced to its smallest value, and the height of the 
blue flame portion of the outer flame was increased to 
its largest value. It is interesting to note that the 
change of flame structure occurred not only at the 
resonant frequency but also at some lower 
frequencies. The mean flame height reduced 
significantly at the resonant frequency, but slightly 
increased at the lower frequencies. In addition, it was 
found that the blue flame formed at flame base near 
the burner exit for the ethylene diluted with 60% 
nitrogen became more luminous and bluer than the 
ethylene without inert dilution, and that the flame 
height decreased with inert dilution.

INTRODUCTION 
 “Singing” diffusion flames were first noted by Higgins 
in 1777 [1]. In 1990, Gore et al. [2] oscillated a jet 
diffusion flame with low power (5 W) at its natural 
frequency. Relatively short and apparently premixed 
flames were stabilized under these conditions. Significant 
enhancement in mixing rates was shown when the flame 
was oscillated at its natural frequency. 
 Demare and Baillot [3] pointed out that acoustically 
modulation could cause the excited jet diffusion flames to 
lift-off stably above the burner. This phenomenon 
occurred because the axial velocities of the flame were 
higher than the maximum velocity in the hysteresis zone. 
A sufficiently high frequency was needed to avoid 
excessive fluctuations of the lift-off height and the 
reattachment. 
 Lakshminarasimha et al. [4] focused on the 
mechanisms responsible for the flow and flame 
structure changes in the case that the forcing was 
strong enough that significant reverse flow existed at 
the burner exit. Simultaneous OH and acetone PLIF 
images were utilized to show the flames anchored on 
the outer-upstream edge of the vortical structures 
where the fuel mixture fraction was reduced due to 
enhanced entrainment. The in-tube premixing and the 
enhanced entrainment were regarded as the 
predominant mechanisms that caused the reduction in 
length and luminosity of the pulsed non-premixed jet 
flames. 
 Besides turbulence combustion applications, Lee 
et al. [5] found that the occurrence of lift-off strongly 
depended on the Reynolds number. The flame lift-off 
appeared easily for Re > 900, for Re < 900 the 
amplitude of acoustic exciter must be increased to 
facilitate the lift-off. In the low Reynolds number cases 
(non-liftoff), the flame features changed in turn 
through unforced flame, fat flame, elongated flame, in-
burning flame and lift-off flame with increasing 
acoustic amplitude. And the directions of the vortices 
were also changed with increasing acoustic amplitude. 
 In Ezekoye et al. [6], the flame issued from a 
closed tube burner was oscillated at its resonant 
frequencies at 230 and 940 Hz. They showed that the 
averaged soot number concentration was reduced by 
almost three orders of magnitude if the flow oscillation 
velocity magnitude was much bigger than the 
averaged flow velocity (0.1 m/s). In addition, the soot 
number concentration was also measured for the 
premixed flame, and it was found that the reduction in 
soot concentration was due to the partially premixed 
flame resulting from the acoustically enhanced air 
entrainment. 
 Constituents of the flue gases by a lift-off flame 
with acoustic excitation were investigated by Chao et 
al. [7]. The NOx concentration emission was 
compared between the flames with and without 
acoustic excitation. The technique of the flame lift-off 
by acoustic excitation could suppress CO 
concentration and reduce NOx emission at the same 
time. Acoustic excitation promoted the mixing in the 
upstream, shortened the flame length, and thus lead 
to low NOx emission. 
 Rocha et al. [8] studied the oscillated flame over 
an industry combustor for the first three resonant 
frequencies. Besides observation on the flame length 
reduction and premixed flame structure, the O2, CO, 
CO2, NOx concentrations and temperature at the

diameter. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 We first discuss the features of the flame 
associated with 0~90 Hz modulating frequencies. The 
concentration of the ethylene (ΩE) without dilution was 
defined as 100%, and the mean flow velocity (V) was 
0.2 m/s. The electric power (P) was set at 15 W.  
Figure 2  shows direct photos of jet flames formed by 
injecting ethylene into a still-air environment under 
the influence of excitation at various frequencies in 
the range of 0 Hz (unexcited) ~ 90 Hz. From the 
results depicted in Fig. 2, the effects of acoustic 
excitation frequency on the appearance of the flame 
can be observed. For the excitation frequencies 
below the characteristic frequency (about 66 Hz) at 
which resonance occurred corresponding to the 
longitudinal mode of the fuel injector tube, the flames 
were attached at the burner exit and their length 
nearly remained constant. Both the unexcited and 
excited flames appeared bright yellow due to soot 
particles. The flame was observed to roll up under 
the influence of vortices near the burner exit. 
Number of vortices shed from the jet increased as 
the excitation frequency increased gradually.   
It is interesting to note that with an increase in 
frequency, the structure of the flame base gradually 
varied from a single-flame structure to a double-
flame structure since the vortices evolved and 
interacted in the mixing region. This implies that the 
mixing of fuel with ambient air near the burner exit 
was apparently enhanced with increasing excitation 
frequency gradually. For a double-flame structure, 
the radius of the outer flame surface at flame base 
was nearly the same as that of the flame without 
acoustic modulation. But the radius of the inner 
flame surface was smaller than the tube diameter 
and was gradually decreased with the increase of 
excitation frequency. 
It was noteworthy that although f = 20 Hz was not 
at the resonant frequency, the flame also had clearly

double flame structure. The inner flame was as 
luminous as the resonant flame, but the root of the 
outer flame appeared yellow. 
With further increasing the frequency to approach 
to 50 Hz, the inner and outer flame surfaces merged 
together. As the modulation frequency was 
increased to be greater than 50 Hz, the inner and 
outer flame surfaces separated again, and the blue 
flame formed at flame base near the burner exit 
became more luminous at the modulation frequency 
close to the resonant frequency 66 Hz. At the 
resonant frequency (f = 66 Hz), the radius of inner 
flame surface was narrowed to the smallest value, 
and the blue flame had the highest height. The 
resonant frequencies in the tube closely matched 
with the values between the calculated and the 
measured resonant frequency, respectively. That is, 
the calculated and the measured resonant frequency 
in the tube are nearly the same, which is about 66 
Hz. Furthermore, the second resonant frequency 
(the first harmonic frequency) was found to be about 
132 Hz (not shown herein), which was also close to 
that calculated by theoretical prediction (133 Hz).  
As discussed above, compared with the un-
modulated flames, the flames with acoustic excitation 
transformed from a single sheet flame (the flame 
without acoustic excitation) to a double flame, 
especially 20 Hz and 66 Hz. Acoustic excitation 
caused the axial velocity to vary sinusoidally. If the 
amplitude of the excitation was large enough, for 
about half of the acoustic phase, the axial velocity 
near the tube wall was reversed. This reversed flow 
caused ambient fluid entrainment into the burner tube 
(in Fig. 3). Therefore, the mixing between ethylene
