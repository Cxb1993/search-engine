2gold on its end faces to perform the streaming potential and
current measurements. They emphasized on the importance of
electrode and reservoir impedance in these measurements.
Using a single nanoslit made on silica glass, van Heyden et al.
[18] show that the maximum conversion efficiency can be
reached is about 3.2% when nanoslit has the depth of 75nm.
Similar to the syuyd of van der Heyden et al. [18], Xie et al.
[19] studied the electrokinetic energy conversion through a
single track-etched nanopore with double-conical shape. The
reported that the conversion efficiency is about 5% as KCl is
driven through the nanopore with small radius of 31nm.
Although several experimental measurements have been
carried out in the past for the electroninetic energy conversion,
most of these studies focused on using neutral electrolyte
such as KCl as the working fluid. In this study, we
experimentally examine the effect of electrolyte types on the
EK performance. The aqueous solutions of potassium
chloride (KCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and formic acid
(HCOOH) are employed as the working electrolytes. An
alumina membrane similar to the one used in the study of Lu
et al. [16] is employed as the nanopore array.
2. Experimental
2.1 Working fluids
In this study, aqueous solutions of KCl, H2SO4 and
HCOOH with bulk concentration 0c varied from 10-6 to
10-1M are used as the working fluids. The KCl, H2SO4 and
HCOOH are ionized in the water according to the following
stochiometric equation,

  
zz BABA  (1)
where (  , z ) and (  , z ) are the stochiometric
coefficient and valence of the cation zA and anion zB ,
respectively.
It is assumed that the KCl and H2SO4 are completely
ionized in the water and considered as the strong electrolytes.
For the aqueous HCOOH solution, the ion concentration
depends on the degree of dissociation and is considered as the
weak electrolyte. Fundamental properties of these working
fluids are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 for KCl, H2SO4 and
HCOOH electrolytes, respectively. In Table 1, the
concentrations of K+ and Cl- are equal to the bulk
concentration value. The pH value deviates slightly from 7
due to water dissociation. In general, they can be regarded as
the neutral solution. 1 is the Debye length defined as,

where F is the Faraday constant,  is the dielectric constant

  zz  . a is the dimensionless Debye
length using the nominal pore radius a (=10nm in this study)
as length reference. In Table 2, concentration of H+ is equal to
two times of the bulk concentration for the requirement of
electronetrality while the concentration of SO42- ion is the
same as the bulk concentration. The pH value decreases as the
bulk concentration increases. The H2SO4 can be regarded as
strong acidic solution when the bulk concentration is high. In
contrast to KCl and H2SO4, HCOOH is a weak electrolyte due
to low degree of dissociation in the water. For temperature of
25℃, the concentrations of H+ and HCOO- are computed and
listed in Table 3. The measured pH value indicates that
HCOOH solution is a weak acidic solution as compared with
the H2SO4 solution. The Debye length of HCOOH calculated
using Eq. (2) is also listed in Table 3. However, it should be
noted that Eq. (2) is defined under the condition for
completely ionized electrolytes and it may have no meaning
for the incomplete ionized solution. In Table 4, the electric
mobilities of the ions appear in the present study are listed for
temperature of 25℃.
2.2 Test devices
The EK cell test unit used in the present study is depicted
schematically in Figure 1(a) and a picture of the EK cell is
shown in Figure 1(b). The nanoscale capillary array was
obtained by using an alumina membrane (Whatman Inc.,
USA) with SEM image shown in Figure 2. As reported by the
manufacturer, the membrane has nominal pore size of 20nm
in diameter and pore density of 10
11
cm
-2
. The diameter and
thickness of this membrane are 25 mm and 60 μm, 
respectively. The membrane is sandwiched between two
PMMA holding blocks with pre-drilled holes for fluid
handing, electrode placement and pressure drop measurement.
Circular well with diameter and depth of 20mm was also
fabricated in each PMMA block serving as the fluid reservoir
after the cell is assembled. A syringe pump (SKD200, SK
Scientific Co., USA) was used as the pumping device to
provide a constant flow rate through the cell. A differential
pressure sensor was connected to the inlet and outlet
reservoirs for measuring the pressure drop as the flow across
the membrane. Silver wires inserted in front of the membrane
are used as the electrodes for measuring the electric current
and potential of the EK cell.
To measure the EK cell performance, the electric potential
and current are measured simultaneously by electric circuit
shown in Figure 1. Two multi-meters (Agilent 34401A and
Keithley 2000, USA) are used to measure the potential and
electric current, respectively. A high-precision adjustable
electric resistance is connected in current measurement circuit
and served as the external electric load. By changing the
resistance, the voltage-current curve (I-V curve) can be
obtained. All the measured results reported in the following
are taken under the steady state and temperature of 25℃.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Experimental results
In this study, the syringe pump is used to deliver the
working fluid into the EK cell. The pressure drop p as the
flow across the membrane is measured by a differential
pressure transducer when the flow becomes steady. During
the experiment, the flow rate can be precisely controlled by
the syringe pump. The flow rate cannot be too high because
the alumina membrane used in the present study is very
fragile. Since the main purpose of the present study is to
investigate the effect of electrolyte types, we fixed the flow
rate Q to be 4ml/min. Under this flow rate, the measured
p across the membrane is 0.07 bar. That is, the pumping
power input is inP = Q ( p )= 41067.4  W.
Using the test procedures described above, the measured
I-V curves for three electrolytes are shown in Figure 3 for
various bulk concentrations. It is seen that the I-V curves are
all linear. This indicates that the EK cell can be treated as a
battery with ideal current source plus an internal resistance
[18]. From the I-V curves, several parameters that
characterizing the EK cell can be deduced. Based on the
streaming potential theory, the maximum electric potential
under zero current is referred to as the streaming potential
4study of van der Heyden et al. [9], higher max can be
resulted with lower counter-ion mobility. By comparing the
results of max for KCl and H2SO4 electrolytes shown in
Figure 6, this is clearly demonstrated experimentally.
Another factor affecting the electrokinetic energy
conversion is the EDL thickness. The EDL overlap is defined
as the situation when the dimensionless Debye length is less
than 1. As indicated in Tables 1 and 2, Debye length of the
KCl electrolyte is smaller than that of H2SO4 electrolyte. In
the low bulk concentration regime, EDL overlap is more
significant when the KCl electrolyte is used. The theoretical
study indicated that higher energy conversion efficiency can
be achieved as the Debye length is small and significant EDL
overlap. Again, this is clearly verified experimentally by
comparing the max obtained using KCl and H2SO4
electrolytes shown in Figure 6. Figure 6 also shows that better
electrokinetic energy conversion efficiency can be obtained
when HCOOH electrolyte is used in high bulk concentration
regime. If the definition of Debye length is also true for the
weak electrolyte, this is again showing that EDL thickness
plays an important role in electrokinetic energy conversion.
4. Estimation of surface charge density
One of the important parameters in electrokinetic energy
conversion is the surface charge density at the membrane
surface. As discussed in the experimental results, it can be
realized that the surface charge density depends on the pH
value, pore size, and charging mechanism. To obtain the
surface charge density is complicated and cannot be measured
directly. Instead of carrying out detail procedures to obtain
the surface charge density, we propose a method for
estimating the overall surface charge density based on the
fitting the theoretical result with the experimental data. As
mentioned earlier, most of the theoretical models were built
using a single channel or capillary as the physical model
[7-12]. A brief summary based on the results reported by
Xuan and Li [27] is given below. We consider a cylindrical
capillary having a radius of a and a length of L . The
capillary wall is charged with a surface charge density of 
as it is in contact with the electrolyte. The ends of the
capillary are connected to inlet and outlet reservoirs which are
assumed to be infinitely large as compared with the capillary
size. For the EK cell operation, fluid flow is driven by an
applied pressure difference and creates an electrical potential
difference. This can be described using the pressure and
voltage differences between the inlet and outlet reservoirs.
Pressure and potential in the inlet and outlet reservoirs are
denoted as 1, 1p , 2 , 2p , respectively. The externally
applied pressure difference is 012  ppp and
the created streaming potential is 012   .
Under such applied pressure difference, the fluid flow
direction is from the inlet reservoir to outlet reservoir. Based
on the Onsager reciprocal theorem, the relations between the
flow rate Q, electric current I, pressure difference p , and
the voltage difference  for the flow with electrokinetic
effect through a channel with any cross-sectional shape can be
written as,

where G represents the hydrodynamic conductance, M
characterizes the electroosmotic flow rate in Eq. (1) and the
streaming current in Eq. (2), and S represents the electrical
conductance. Detail expressions for G, M and S can be found
in several studies [27-29].

To carry out the theoretical prediction, we use a=10nm and
L=60um which are taken from the nominal diameter of the
membrane pore used in the experiment, p =0.07 bar based
on the experimental data, and ion mobilities listed Table 4.
The only remained unknown is the surface charge density 
which is used as a boundary condition for solving the Poisson
equation. By carefully adjust  to let the theoretical
predicted max be fitted with experimental data shown in
Figure 6, one may estimate the overall surface charge density
