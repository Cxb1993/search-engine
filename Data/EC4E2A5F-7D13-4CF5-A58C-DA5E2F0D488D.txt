Abstract 
Effects of tool size on fracture and fatigue behaviors of friction stir spot welds (FSSW) in 
cross-tensile specimens of 6061-T6 aluminum sheets were investigated based on experimental 
observations. Welds made by three tools with different sizes, T1, T2 and T3, at different rotational speed, 
dwelling time and indentation depth were tested under quasi-static opening conditions. The nugget 
pullout, interfacial and mixed type failure modes can be observed. The experimental results indicate that 
the failure strengths and failure modes of “good＂ welds made under different processing conditions 
show significant dependence on the tool size. Then, welds made by the three tools at the optimum 
processing parameters of T3 tool were tested under cyclic opening conditions. Under cyclic loading 
conditions, the fatigue lives and failure modes of the welds strongly depend on the tool size and applied 
load amplitude. For T1 tool, the mixed mode failure mode can be found. For T2 tool, when the welds are 
subjected to high and low cycle fatigue loading conditions, the upper-sheet and lower-sheet nugget 
pullout failure modes can be found, respectively. For T3 tool, except the two failure modes mentioned 
above, another transient failure mode can be found between them. Finally, optical and scanning electron 
micrographs of the welds made by the three tools before and after failure were examined and micro 
indentation tests of these welds were conducted.

3-1.3摩擦攪拌點銲十字拉伸試片拉之微觀觀察 
圖 3-2 為攪拌刀具 T3 於最佳參數製作之摩擦攪拌點銲經拉伸測試前之橫斷面圖。圖 3-2(a)是
試片經拉伸試驗前的橫斷面圖，圖 3-2(b)為圖 3-2(a)中的區域 I、II、III以及 IV放大圖。圖中銲點
採用攪拌刀具 T3，銲接參數為(1)轉速 800 rpm，(2)進给深度 1.65 mm，(3)停留時間 1 sec.。如圖
3-2(a)所示，銲點上方可以看到一個經由攪拌刀具銲接加工所造成的凹陷輪廓，此為攪拌刀具之探
針及肩部的幾何外形。依據摩擦攪拌點銲横斷面中各區域顯微結構的定義，靠近中心凹孔的兩側為
攪拌區(stir zone)，由於本研究中的刀具探針外形並無螺紋，導致此區域在金相圖中並不明顯。在
刀具肩部凹痕下方有一弧形的交界線，交界線左右對稱，起點大致從刀具肩部的外緣，向下逐漸內
縮最後消失在凹孔底部，外觀近似碗形。在交界線內側區域因受刀具攪拌、擠壓與摩擦熱的影響，
產生較細晶粒使其顏色相對於母材偏暗，此區域即為熱機影響區(TMAZ)。在交界線外側僅受摩擦
熱影響而未受到刀具攪拌與擠壓的區域即為熱影響區(HAZ)，此區域的晶粒較母材略粗但金相上有
時很難區別，需依靠微硬度測試才能確認其範圍。如圖 3-2(a)所示，上下試片未銲接處的介面在銲
點外圍自然形成兩道縫隙，延伸到熱機影響區與攪拌區交界附近時，縫隙受高溫高壓的攪拌及擠壓
而形成兩道接近水平之直線，最後消失在攪拌區內。受刀具肩部下壓和摩擦的作用，部份上試片的
材料被擠壓至肩部外，同時也推擠部份上試片材料沿著肩部壓痕外緣向外延伸，造成壓痕下方上試
片的厚度減少。然而，受附近材料的限制，使上試片沿著壓痕外緣產生少許彎曲現象，造成上下試
片的間隙。一部份受刀具肩部擠壓出來的上試片材料會堆積在上試片表面形成一環狀隆起，分布在
肩部壓痕外圍。值得一提的是，Thornton 等人[2]研究指出，鋁合金電阻點銲時，在銲點處常會有
多孔性的缺陷結構出現，但在本實驗中摩擦攪拌點銲的銲點並沒有出現類似的缺陷。 
在圖 3-2(b)中，可以看到區域 I的放大圖，顯示母材(base metal)上有較為粗大的晶粒，區域 II
的放大圖則顯示熱機影響區(thermal-mechanical affected zone)的晶粒比較細緻，並可觀察到晶粒在
由粗變細的交界處有扭曲的現象。區域 III的放大圖則顯示出攪拌區(stir zone)的晶粒非常細緻。在
攪拌區內的細緻晶粒可能是在銲接過程中，晶粒受高溫高壓及攪拌的影響發生再結晶而成形的等軸
細晶粒。這些在摩擦攪拌點銲區的等軸細晶粒也出現在 Lin 等人的研究中[1]。如圖 3-2(b)區域 IV
的放大圖所示，圖中的縫隙從熱機影響區延伸向攪拌區，在攪拌區附近微微向上傾斜並且逐漸消失
在攪拌區內。

第四章 結論 
本研究在探討刀具尺寸對鋁合金 6061-T6摩擦攪拌點銲十字拉伸試片之破裂與疲勞行為之影
響。研究中根據文獻[16]的刀具尺寸設計原則，製作三把不同尺寸的攪拌刀具 T1、T2及 T3。採用
實驗設計法取得攪拌刀具 T3在最大開裂強度下的最佳參數，並以此參數為基礎，探討各種製程參
數對不同刀具尺寸的影響。最後，攪拌刀具 T1、T2、T3以 T3的最佳參數備製試片，對銲點進行
疲勞試驗。最後以微硬度試驗、金相顯微觀察及 SEM觀察，詳細觀察銲點在測試前後的顯微結構
與破壞模式並進行討論。主要研究結果如下所列： 
1. 利用實驗設計法得到攪拌刀具 T3在最大開裂強度下的最佳參數為: (1)刀具轉速 800 rpm、
(2)進給深度 1.65 mm、(3)停留時間 1 sec.、(4)進給速率 0.2 mm/s。 
2. 攪拌刀具 T1、T2、T3 以 T3 的最佳參數製備的十字拉伸試片經靜態拉伸破壞後皆為銲點
拔出破壞模式，其平均拉伸強度分別為 1321N、1701N及 2372N。 
3. 製程參數的主效應顯示，轉速、停留時間與進給深度的變化對接合機理與破壞模式有顯著
的影響。轉速的增加會大幅減少接合面積。停留時間的增加雖然會使接合面積增加，但太
長的時間反而會使材料過度軟化。最後，進給深度的增加會減少銲點上試片的厚度。這些
因素造成銲點強度顯著地變化。 
4. 根據攪拌刀具 T1、T2 及 T3 在相同參數下的銲點橫斷面流動性觀察，三把刀具的攪拌效
果為 T3 > T2 > T1。 
5. 根據銲點微硬度的觀察，硬度從母材、熱影響區至熱機影響區附近，硬度值逐漸減少，在
熱影響區與熱機影響區的交界附近有最小值，之後硬度值逐漸提高，在中央凹孔附近有局

ABSTRACT 
In this paper, the stress intensity factor solutions for spot 
welds in U-shape specimens are investigated by finite 
element analyses.  Three-dimensional finite element 
models are developed for U-shape specimens to obtain 
accurate stress intensity factor solutions.  In contrast to 
the existing investigations of the stress intensity factor 
solutions based on the finite element analyses, various 
ratios of the sheet thickness to the nugget radius, the 
half width of the central square portions to the nugget 
radius and the half specimen length to the half specimen 
width are considered in this investigation.  The 
computational results confirm the functional dependence 
on the nugget radius and sheet thickness of Zhang’s 
stress intensity factor solutions for U-shape specimens.  
The computational results provide a geometric function 
in terms of the normalized width of the central square 
portions and the aspect ratio of the bottom and top 
sheets of the U parts to Zhang’s stress intensity factor 
solutions for U-shape specimens.  Finally, based on the 
analytical and computational results, the dimensions of 
U-shape specimens are suggested. 
INTRODUCTION 
Resistance spot welding is widely used to join sheet 
metals for automotive components.  The fatigue lives of 
spot welds have been investigated by many researchers 
in various types of specimens, for example, see Zhang 
[1].  Since the spot weld provides a natural crack or 
notch along the weld nugget circumference, fracture 
mechanics has been adopted to investigate the fatigue 
lives of spot welds in various types of specimens based 
on the stress intensity factor solutions at the critical 
locations of spot welds [1-11].  Note that the stress 
intensity factors usually vary point by point along the 
circumference of spot welds in various types of 
specimens.  In order to obtain accurate stress and strain 
distributions and/or stress intensity factor solutions for 
spot welds in various specimens, finite element analyses 
have been carried out by various investigators [12-16].  
However, no systematic investigation of the effects of 
the geometric factors on the stress intensity factor 
solutions for U-shape specimens exists in the literature. 
Figure 1 schematically shows three types of U-shape 
specimens, typical U-shape specimen, double-U 
specimen and Chrysler specimen, commonly used to 
investigate the strength and fatigue lives of spot welds 
under opening or opening/shear loading conditions.  As 
shown in the figure, the double-U specimen is developed 
by Hahn et al. [17], the Chrysler specimen is developed 
by Lee et al. [18], and the typical U-shape specimen is 
given in the standard of AWS [19].  The applied opening 
force 2/F  is shown as the bold arrows.  The weld 
nugget is idealized as a circular cylinder as shown in the 
figure.  The critical locations with the maximum mode I 
stress intensity factors are marked as point A and point 
B.  The U-shape specimen has the sheet thickness t , 
the nugget diameter a2 , the specimen width W2 , the 
specimen length L2 , the flange height H , and the 
corner radius r  as shown in Figure 1.  Note that b2  is 
the width of the central square portions of the bottom 
and top sheets of the upper and lower U parts marked 
by dashed lines as shown in Figures 1(b) and 1(c).  
Based on the standard of AWS [19] and the research 
work of Lee et al. [18], two cuboidal spacers are needed 
to insert inside the upper and lower U parts of the 
specimen.  The flanges of the specimen with the 
spacers are clamped by the fixtures/grips or bolts to 
apply the opening load. 
In this paper, we investigate the stress intensity factor 
solutions for spot welds in U-shape specimens by a 
systematic finite element analysis.  Three-dimensional 
finite element models based on the finite element model 
for two circular plates with connection [20] are used to 
obtain the stress intensity factor solutions for U-shape 
specimens.  The stress intensity factor solutions as 
functions of the ratios at / , ab / , WL /  and aH /  are 
Due to symmetry, only a half U-shape specimen is 
considered.  Figure 2(a) schematically shows a half U-
shape specimen with a uniform displacement applied to 
the upper edge surfaces of the specimen shown as the 
bold arrows, a clamped boundary condition applied to 
the lower edge surfaces of the specimen and a roller 
edge boundary condition applied to the side surfaces of 
the flanges.  The half cylinder represents the half weld 
nugget.  The specimen has the sheet thickness t  (=0.65 
mm), the half specimen length L  (=12.7 mm), the half 
specimen width W  (=12.7 mm), the flange height H  
(=25.4 mm), the corner radius r  (=0 mm) and the 
nugget radius a  (=3.2 mm) based on the dimensions of 
the U-shape specimen listed in the standard of AWS [19].  
Note that the corner radius r  is in general determined 
based on the bendability of the sheet material and is 
usually very small [19].  Therefore, the corner radius r  is 
taken as 0 mm for simplicity.  Both the upper and lower 
sheets have the same thickness.  A Cartesian 
coordinate system is also shown in the figure.  As shown 
in Figure 2(a), a uniform displacement is applied in the 
z−  direction to the upper edge surfaces of the specimen, 
and the displacements in the x , y  and z  directions for 
the lower edge surfaces of the specimen are constrained 
to represent the clamped boundary conditions in the 
experiment.  The displacement in the y  direction of the 
symmetry plane, the zx −  plane, is constrained to 
represent the symmetry condition due to the loading 
conditions and the geometry of the specimen.  The 
displacement in the x  direction of the inner and outer 
side surfaces of the flanges is constrained to represent 
the constraint conditions due to the spacers and fixtures. 
Figure 2(b) shows a mesh for a left half finite element 
model.  Figure 2(c) shows a close-up view of the mesh 
near the main crack tip.  Note that the main crack is 
modeled as a sharp crack here.  The three-dimensional 
finite element mesh near the weld nugget is evolved 
from the three-dimensional finite element mesh for two 
circular plates with connection as discussed in Wang et 
al. [20].  As shown in Figure 2(c), the mesh near the 
center of the weld nugget is refined to ensure 
reasonable aspect ratios of the three-dimensional brick 
elements.  The three-dimensional finite element model 
for the half U-shape specimen has 25,240 20-node 
quadratic brick elements.  The main crack surfaces are 
shown as bold lines in Figure 2(c). 
In this investigation, the weld nugget and the base metal 
are assumed to be linear elastic isotropic materials.  The 
Young’s modulus E  is taken as 200 GPa, and the 
Poisson’s ratio ν  is taken as 0.3.  The commercial finite 
element program ABAQUS [21] is employed to perform 
the computations.  Brick elements with quarter point 
nodes and collapsed nodes along the crack front are 
used to model the r/1  singularity near the crack tip. 
First, the distributions of the stress intensity factor 
solutions along the circumference of the nugget are 
investigated here.  Figure 3 shows the normalized IK  
solutions as functions of θ  for the crack front along the 
nugget circumference based on the three-dimensional 
finite element computational results for the U-shape 
specimen with 2.0/ =at , 97.3/ =ab , 1/ =WL , 
94.7/ =aH , and 0/ =ar .  Note that both U-shape 
specimens with and without spacers are considered.  
The IK  solutions are normalized by the IK  solution for 
the U-shape specimen with spacers at o180=θ , denoted 
by ( )maxIK .  The normalized IK  solutions based on the 
computational results for U-shape specimens with and 
without spacers and fixtures are denoted as SpacerK I _  
and NoSpacerK I _ , respectively.  As shown in Figure 3, 
the general trends of SpacerK I _  and NoSpacerK I _  
agree well with each other.  The maxima of the IK  
solutions are located at o0=θ  and o180  and the minima 
of the IK  solutions are located at 
o90=θ  and o270 .  
Note that the maxima of NoSpacerK I _  are larger than 
those of SpacerK I _  but the minima of NoSpacerK I _  
are smaller than those of SpacerK I _ .  The distributions 
of the stress intensity factor solutions along the 
circumference of the nugget as shown in Figure 3 are 
similar to those in Radaj et al. [12]. 
Next, we investigate the effects of the boundary 
conditions on the right and left edge surfaces of the 
bottom and top sheets of the upper and lower U parts of 
the specimen.  Two models of two square plates joint by 
a spot weld subjected to a uniform displacement along 
the right and left edge surfaces of the upper plate shown 
as the bold arrows and different types of boundary 
conditions are considered.  One square plate model is 
subjected to simply supported edge boundary conditions 
on the right and left edge surfaces of the lower plate.  
Another square plate model is subjected to roller edge 
boundary conditions on the right and left edge surfaces 
of the square plates.  The two square plate models 
represent the bottom and top sheets of the upper and 
lower U parts.  The normalized IK  solutions based on 
the computational results for the two square plate 
models subjected to roller edge and simply supported 
edge boundary conditions on the right and left edge 
surfaces are denoted as RollerKI _  and SimpleKI _ , 
respectively.  The square plates have 2.0/ =at , 
97.3/ =aW , and 97.3/ =aL .  As shown in Figure 3, the 
general trends of RollerKI _  and SimpleKI _  also 
agree well with those of SpacerK I _  and NoSpacerK I _ .  
The maxima of NoSpacerK I _  are smaller than those of 
SimpleKI _  but larger than those of SpacerK I _  and 
RollerKI _ .  On the other hand, RollerKI _  virtually 
coincides with SpacerK I _  as shown in Figure 3.  This 
indicates that the flanges with spacers and fixtures gives 
full constraint and is identical to the roller edge boundary 
condition.  Therefore, the effects of the flange height for 
specimens with spacers and fixtures can be neglected. 
Now, the effects of ab /  on the geometric factor IF  are 
investigated.  In order to investigate the effects of ab /  
on the geometric factor IF , a nearly square U-shape 
specimen with 1/ =WL  is considered here to avoid the 
effects of the aspect ratio WL / .  Figure 5 shows the 
normalized IK  solutions at the critical locations (point A 
and point B as shown in Figure 1) as functions of ab /  
based on our three-dimensional finite element 
computations with 1/ =WL , 94.7/ =aH , 0/ =ar , and 
20.0/ =at , the analytical solution of Zhang [9] for 
double-U specimens in Equation (1), and the analytical 
solution of Zhang [9] for Chrysler specimens in Equation 
(2).  The IK  solutions are normalized by the analytical 
solution of Zhang [9] in Equation (1) without Dξ .  Note 
that we select a small value of 20.0/ =at  to avoid the 
effects of the thickness.  The range of the ratio ab /  is 
selected from 2.0 to 25.0.  The normalized IK
~  solutions 
based on the computational results, the analytical 
solution of Zhang [9] for double-U specimens in 
Equation (1), and the analytical solution of Zhang [9] for 
Chrysler specimens in Equation (2) are denoted as 
FEMKI _
~ , DoubleUK I _
~ , and ChrylserK I _
~ , 
respectively.  Therefore, FEMKI _
~  represents the 
geometric factor IF  for 1/ =WL , 94.7/ =aH , 0/ =ar , 
and 20.0/ =at  according to Equation (6).  Here, we 
develop different three-dimensional finite element 
models by changing the half width of the square portions 
b  with the nugget radius a  being fixed. 
As shown in Figure 5, IF  decreases significantly when 
ab /  increases and appears to decrease slowly when 
ab /  is greater than 13.  As ab /  decreases from 5, IF  
increases significantly.  For example, the values of IF  
are nearly 3.60 and 1.51 as ab /  equals 2 and 5, 
respectively.  As 13/5 << ab , the rate of decrease 
slows down as ab /  increases.  When ab /  increases 
from 13, IF  decreases slowly as ab /  increases further.  
For example, the values of IF  are nearly 0.76 and 0.43 
as ab /  equals 13 and 25.  As ab /  further increases 
from 25, IF  seems to decrease slightly based on the 
trend of IF  as the function of ab / .  IF  should continue 
to decrease as ab /  increases based on the analytical 
solution of Lin and Pan [11] in Equations (3)-(5).  As 
shown in Figure 5, the general trends of DoubleUKI _
~ , 
ChrylserK I _
~  and IF  are similar when 7/3 << ab .  As 
ab /  decreases from 7, the deviations between the 
Zhang’s solutions, DoubleUK I _
~  and ChrylserK I _
~ , and 
the computational results IF  gradually increase.  For 
example, the values of IF  are nearly 50% and 20% 
higher than those of DoubleUK I _
~  and ChrylserK I _
~  
when as ab /  equals 3 and 7, respectively.  Note that 
the IK  solutions for double-U specimens and Chrysler 
specimens of Zhang [9] are only applicable for 
7/3 ≤≤ ab . 
Note that Zhang [9] used the analytical stress solution 
for a rigid inclusion under center bending in an infinite 
plate to approximate that under counter opening for the 
IK  solution of U-shape specimens.  In addition, the 
effects of aL /  and aW /  or those of WL /  and ab /  are 
not considered together for the geometric factors Dξ and 
Cξ .  Therefore, the underestimation of the IK  solution 
for finite ratios of ab / ’s based on Zhang’s IK  solutions 
can be attributed to these reasons.  In order to estimate 
the IK  solution for U-shape specimens, Lin and Pan [11] 
derived the IK  solution (Equations (3)-(5)) at the critical 
locations for a spot weld at the center of two square 
plates under opening, cross opening/closing, and 
counter bending conditions, denoted as PanLinK I &_
~ .  
Note that for a square U-shape specimen with spacers 
and fixtures, the value of cg  for PanLinK I &_
~  in 
Equation (5) is identical to 1 whereas ch  can be 
neglected.  As shown in Figure 5, the general trends of 
IF  based on our three-dimensional finite element 
computations and PanLinK I &_
~  of Lin and Pan [11] 
are quite similar.  As 25/4 << ab , IF  and 
PanLinK I &_
~  agree very well with each other.  
Therefore, the IK  solution of Lin and Pan [11] can be 
used to represent the solution for a U-shape specimen 
with ab /  between 4 and 25.  Note that the difference of 
PanLinK I &_
~  becomes larger as ab /  decreases from 
4.  For example, the value of IF  is nearly 30% higher 
than that of PanLinK I &_
~  when ab /  equals 2.  A 
possible reason is that the closed-form stress solutions 
of the finite plate model based on the approximated 
boundary conditions are only acceptable for 5/ ≥ab  as 
mentioned in Lin et al. [22], Lin and Pan [10], and Lin 
and Pan [11]. 
EFFECTS OF SPECIMEN LENGTH TO SPECIMEN 
WIDTH ( WL / ) 
Next, the effects of WL /  on the geometric factor IF  are 
investigated.  First we investigate the effects of WL /  on 
the geometric factor IF  for Chrysler specimens.  the 
three-dimensional finite element models for Chrysler 
specimens have different values of the half specimen 
length L  with the half specimen width W  ( b= ), the 
nugget radius a , the sheet thickness t , the flange 
height H , and the corner radius r  being fixed.  Figure 6 
shows the normalized IK  solutions at the critical 
locations (point A and point B as shown in Figure 1) of 
Chrysler specimens as functions of WL /  based on our 
three-dimensional finite element computations.  The 
for the two cases.  As listed in the table, IF  is much 
greater than 1 for the specimen used in our computation 
and is a bit greater than 1 for the specimen used in 
Radaj et al. [12].  Note that the interpolation method is 
approximate in nature since we do not have the results 
to account for the coupling effects of ab /  and WL /  in 
this investigation. 
Table 5 lists the normalized IK  solutions by 
*
II KF .  As 
listed in Table 5, the normalized IK  solution of Radaj et 
al. [12] equals 1.  This indicates that the geometric 
functions IF  based on our computational results are 
indeed needed and useful to scale the IK  solutions.  
Note that the effects of at /  cannot be accounted by IF , 
and the coupling effects of ab /  and WL /  cannot be 
accounted based on our interpolation method.  The 
determination of IF  is based on the computational 
results for the small ratio of 2.0/ =at .  Further 
investigations to account the effects of at /  can be found 
in Lin and Pan [23] 
CONCLUSIONS 
Three-dimensional finite element analyses are carried 
out to investigate the stress intensity factor solutions for 
spot welds at the critical locations in U-shape specimens.  
In contrast to the existing investigations of the stress 
intensity factor solutions based on the finite element 
analyses, various ratios of the sheet thickness to the 
nugget radius, the half width of the central square 
portion to the nugget radius and the half specimen 
length to the half specimen width are considered in this 
investigation.  The computational results confirm the 
functional dependence on the nugget radius and sheet 
thickness of Zhang’s analytical solutions for U-shape 
specimens.  The computational results provide a 
geometric function in terms of the normalized width of 
the central square portion and the aspect ratio of the 
bottom and top sheets of the U parts to Zhang’s 
analytical solutions for U-shape specimens.  Finally, 
based on the analytical and computational results, the 
dimensions of U-shape specimens are suggested.
