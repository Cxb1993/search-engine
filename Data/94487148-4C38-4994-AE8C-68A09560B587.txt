 1. Introduction 
In the first-year project, we develop the prototype of I3S that is applied to be a platform for building 
the “travel” domain knowledge portal (Travel@I3S). To verify the usability of I3S, following 
subsystems are tested for the case study. Detailed design and implementation of the I3S prototype is 
illustrated in [20]. 
 I3MC (MetaCrawler): I3MC integrates functionalities of the web crawler, metacrawler, and 
focused crawler, domain-related websites and pages can be efficiently and effectively collected 
by I3MC through a few manual interactions. 
 I3ME (Metadata Extractor): I3ME automatically extracts metadata from domain-related pages. 
In the Travel@I3S case study, the system successfully extracts metadata information from two 
famous travel websites in Taiwan and integrates those data into 7,768 travel objects. In par with 
fully-manual operations, precision and recall rates of I3ME are 84.98% and 94.01%, 
respectively. 
In the second-year project, we select an alternative domain “Book” for verifying the I3S platform 
for various domain applications. Following the three-phase SOP (standard operation procedure) 
draft applied in the first-year project, steps of building the Book@I3S for the “Book Domain 
Knowledge Portal” and observed troubles are spelled out as follows:  
 Domain Data Collection (I3DDC Phase). Given the domain keyword “book (書)”, I3MC 
rapidly returns important websites: 博客來網路書店, 臺灣大學圖書館, and 金石堂網路書
店. The domain expert observed that collecting the book metadata information by issuing ISBN 
to these websites is the most efficient approach to explore all book objects from these websites. 
However, how to train computer programs to realize the search format of each website? The 
similar problem is also discussed in “the Hidden Web [23] or the Deep Web [15]”. Some 
databases or knowledge bases behind websites can not be explored through hyperlinks. An 
alternative approach to explore the knowledge from a website is mining the search format 
defined in the <form>-clause of the site. Therefore, the problem motivates the novel study of 
the project “mining search arguments of websites” so that I3DDC is able to automatically 
crawl domain-related pages through the intelligent MetaSearcher (I3MS) developed in the 
second-year project. By solving this problem, Book@I3S has successfully gathered all 
book-related pages by sending Taiwan’s ISBN codes (shown in Figure 1) to search interfaces of 
provided by I3MI, I3KM employs concepts within domain hierarchies, extracted keyphrases and 
metadata fields to analyze some metadata information (i.e. attribute-value pairs) to build the 
conceptual knowledge map. An alternative data from the “attribute-values” is applying metadata to 
improve the classification performance in the system I3DOC. Detailed illustrations about these 
research problems and systems are spelled out in following sections.

2. Related Work 
Several ideas and concepts employed in the I3S, such as Focused Crawler, Page Partition and 
Information Extraction, are studied the report of the first-year project. Most studies about the 
project have already surveyed in the project proposal, we omit the detail in this concise report. 
Following subsections illustrate studies related to novel topics discussed in the second-project. 
More detailed surveys on related works can be referred in [17][20][35]. 
2.1. Explore the Hidden Web 
Many professional websites provide ad hoc search services, in which several fields are available as 
parameters for users to precisely search domain-related information. For example, library sites 
relevant” to the query. Undoubtedly, search results provide hints to obtain the desired information 
or knowledge. We define different types of pages retrieved by search engine to spell out concepts 
and ideas used in remaining sections, as shown in Figure 3. 
 Result pages, retrieved by search engines, consist of links to target pages and next pages. 
 Target pages, pointed by links within a result page, may contain informative content relevant 
to the user’s query. However, the user must visit the page for the usability. 
 Next pages are regular links within a result page for browsing all result pages. 
 Metadata pages are pages containing useful metadata, as shown in Figure 4, that are directly or 
indirectly (transitively directly) visible from target pages. 
Target Pages are recognized 
as “relevant” to the query.
Next Pages link to more 
search results
Result Pages summarize 
the search result.
Click and Click
Metadata Pages are target 
pages that may contain 
useful metadata about the 
query.

When a domain expert interacts with the system and wants to collect domain data, he or she sends 
 Analyze seed pages retrieved by search engines and recommend websites, categories, and pages 
for the domain expert. 
 Expand seed pages from selected websites or categories. 
 Extract domain concepts from the expanded seed pages. 
 Use these concepts to retrieve more seed pages for advanced analysis.

3.2. Web Pages Grouping 
Aforementioned “category” means a set of domain-related pages since not all pages of a website 
are always relevant to a specific domain. After parsing web pages, the system may get many pages 
with titles published by the same website, URL and title strings are used to group pages into 
categories. Grouping pages ion categories facilitates the domain expert to efficiently realize the size 
and domain-relevance of a category. Therefore, the expert may recognize some important 
domain-related websites or categories through interactions with the user interface as follows. 
 URL-based grouping: The system classifies pages, sharing the same hostname or IP address, 
into the same category, i.e. a website is also regarded as a category. Figure 7 is an example of 
grouping pages by the website (hostname). By clicking links below the “UrlGroup” column, the 
website is refined into categories based on the hierarchical “path” of the URL. Therefore, by 
browsing the websites step-by-step through the path, the expert can gradually refine the whole 
website into smaller sized categories and observe the domain-relevance based on averaging 
pages similarities to the domain concepts. 
After performing URL and title-based grouping methods, highly domain-related websites or 
categories are selected by domain experts. The system can extract more keywords and phrases from 
these titles or pages. As results shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, the system extracts several 
domain-related concepts about “線上購物”, like “PChome”, “24h”, “商店街” etc, for expanding 
the domain knowledge. 
3.3. Exploring the Website 
Among these recognized important domain categories, some websites have search interface for 
querying their hidden databases. The system explores the main search interface started from the 
“homepage” of a website by analyzing the <form>-clause with embedded tags (e.g. <input>, 
<select>, <option>, etc.). Also, the <form>-clause may be metadata-rich, in which search fields 
with corresponding to text-based input areas are considered as attribute-value (AV) pairs for 
representing the domain metadata. The “action” attribute has a string indicating the URL of the CGI 
program that usually connects to the database behind the website. By submitting system-generated 
strings (e.g. ISBN for querying books of the library), the system automatically collects 
domain-related metadata pages, the hidden Web of the website’s database is therefore automatically 
explored. Parameters of the CGI program (e.g. search.cgi?q=library) consist of the left-hand side (q) 
and the right-hand side (library), which are corresponding attributes and values, respectively. As 
shown in Figure 9, the value is a textbox for typing query strings, and the attribute is a field to 
indicate the parameter name. By analyzing tags and texts within the <form>-clause and assigning 
each text string to correct components (attribute or value), parameters of the CGI program can be 
uncovered. 
ValueAttribute

DC fields for providing unified domain metasearch. Obviously, providing cross-domain search 
services is also possible by mapping different domain metadata into the common 15 DC fields.

4. Metadata-based Integration and Classification 
Metadata facilitate the information integration in digital libraries. I3S also thoroughly applies 
domain metadata to integrate and classify domain objects. For the example of travel domain 
developed in the first-year project, extracted domain objects are categorized into the geographic 
Domain Concept Hierarchy (DCH) based on the attribute “地址 (address)” that is also mapped to 
the DC field “dc:coverage”. In this way, the scenic spot “日月潭  (Sun Moon Lake)” is 
automatically assigned to the hierarchical path “中部 /南投縣 /魚池鄉 / (Mid-land/Nantou 
County/Yuchih Township/)” according to the “dc:coverage” attribute. Consequently, all scenic 
domain objects of are perfectly and efficiently assigned to the geographic DCH. Obviously, I3DOC 
runs the metadata-based classification process to assign domain objects to correct directories 
according to the knowledge of domain experts. 
Based on the geographic DCH, metadata integration is also efficient and effective by restricting to 
domain objects in the same directory. Given a domain object, finding the most semantically 
identical object is restricted to searching “the best matched dc:title” objects from the specific 
directory rather than the whole database. Regarding one object’s title as a query sequence and titles 
the whole database. Using the category “北部/基隆市/ (Northern/Keelong City/)” as an example, 
domain metadata extracted from different websites can be easily integrated by aligning title strings, 
as examples shown Figure 11. This idea also dramatically reduces the complexity of “pairwise title 
alignment” from aligning the whole database objects O(N2) to aligning objects in some directory 
O(mk2), where k is far less than N and m is the number of directory. 
The complete domain metadata of “Sun Moon Lake” integrated from different travel websites is 
shown in Figure 12. The address attribute is used to locate the position on Google Map. Hyperlinks 
of news and blog articles about the scenic spot are automatically collected from Google News and 
famous blog sites by issuing significant keywords (estimated from “dc:title” and “dc:description”) 
to the metacrawler, I3MC. In this way, I3S automatically integrates all metadata for the domain 
object and presents all information needs in the same web page that avoids users visiting too many 
pages for integrating the information. 
In the book domain constructed in this project, I3MI is applied to integrate the complete book 
metadata including, basic metadata, book comments, pricing information, libraries, owners, and 
associations, as shown in Figure 13. 
 
Figure 12: The integrated scenic domain object (Sun Moon Lake) is knowledgeable with complete 
metadata information and is valuable for many web applications. 
KM to provide browsing services. I3KM is already applied in several domain case studies (news, 
telecommunication, and book) to provide KM-based browsing services that is useful for users to 
explore domain-related information. Detailed design and implementation of I3KM (i.e. O2RES) is 
spelled out in [17]. 
6. I3CF: Domain Catalog/Ontology Fusion 
In this project, we recognize two types of catalog fusion mechanism:  
 Metadata-based catalog identification and fusion. 
 Multi-DCH catalog fusion. 
6.1. Metadata-based Catalog Identification and Fusion 
The geographic DCH seems properly to be the global directory hierarchy that satisfies the browsing 
behavior of the web user. However, there are conceptual categories can be extracted and integrated 
into the DCH. I3CF analyzes integrated domain metadata and interacts with the domain expert to 
explore more feasible categories. For example, by running simple SQL queries to analyze 
cardinalities of fields based on integrated domain objects, the attribute “dc:type” is identified as a 
feasible DCH. Then, I3S automatically extract 16 concepts from the database as follows:  
 古蹟寺廟 (historic spot and temple),  
 展示中心 (exhibition center) 
 主題農場 (topical ranch),  
 風景休憩 (scenic area for recreation),  
 公園休憩 (park area for recreation), 
 旅客服務 (passenger service center),  
 自然景觀 (natural scenic area),  
 主題樂園 (topical paradise),  
 藝術人文 (arts and culture),  
 港口濱海 (harbor and sea area),  
 溫泉冷泉 (hot and cold spring),  
 林場森林 (forest and farm),  
 地標建築 (landmark and building),  
 美食購物 (delicacy and shopping),  
 步道古道 (trail and old way), and 
 都會人文 (metropolis and civilization). 
These conceptual categories are adequate to provide the DCH from the “topical subject” perspective. 
The topical DCH is verified by the expert and merged into categories of the geographic DCH. 
Combine topical and geographic DCHs, Travel@I3S provides topical tours services while web 
users are focusing on counties or townships. Consequently, I3CF integrates concepts, domain 
finally the same with the master DCH. Therefore, following bottom-up operations are employed to 
dynamically adjust the framework of DCH. 
 Generalization. If two or more catalogs, sharing the same parent catalog, are similar, the system 
attempts to generalize these catalogs into one common catalog. 
 Specialization. If objects of a catalog are not similar, these objects should be specialized into 
two or more catalogs to retain the coherence of each catalog. 
As for estimating the similarity between two catalogs, following measures are employed:  
 Concept-based similarity. The catalog name is regarded as the most representative concept for 
denoting the common properties of its sub-catalogs and objects. For example, “商業理財” is 
one of the level-1 catalog in the master DCH, and “商業” is the level-one catalog of the slave. 
To measure the similarity between tow names, the edit-distance is employed to align two 
strings.  
 Object-based similarity. Common objects shared by two catalogs are used to measure the 
similarity of both catalogs. 
Basically, high-level (close to the root) catalogs tend to have similar names, so that the 
concept-based measure is better for high-level catalogs. Also, high-level catalogs frequently have 
few objects since most objects are organized into hierarchical sub-catalogs. On the other way, the 
object-based measure is adequate to estimate similarities between low-level catalogs, in which these 
catalogs contain many objects. 
7. Conclusion and Future Work 
In this project, we design and implement subsystems of the Intelligent Internet Information System 
(I3S), including I3MS, I3MI, I3DOC, I3KM and I3CF. These subsystems gradually explore 
databases behind domain-related websites, extract and integrate metadata into more complete 
domain objects, classify these objects based on metadata, learn the knowledge map of the domain 
from domain objects, and fuse websites directories into the global DCH. 
In future, we would like to improve subsystems of I3S to become more intelligent with less manual 
interactions. Then, I3S will be tested in various domains, such as education, recipe, auction, health, 
learning, culture, environment, etc. In fact, solving a problem frequently needs information, 
metadata and knowledge from several domains. For example, people using the travel domain also 
need domains about auction, weather information, culture, etc. By building several domain
