characteristics are often highly correlated, or automated test and inspection 
procedures where every process or product characteristic is measured on 
every unit in time order of production. The purpose of the present paper is to 
report the results of a simulation study on the behavior of the BCa bootstrap 
confidence interval for estimating Cpmk when collected data are correlated 
and follow a specific Burr distribution. The Burr distribution is employed 
here to represent various probability distribution functions. Effects of 
sample size, process capability, non-normality and correlation in the data on 
the BCa bootstrap interval of Cpmk are simultaneously studied. The BCa 
bootstrap confidence interval, the Burr distribution, and generation of a set 
of correlated data are briefly reviewed in the following sections. The 
simulation study is then described. Finally, a detailed discussion on the 
simulation results is presented and some conclusions are given. 
 
2. The BCa bootstrap confidence interval 
Let x1, x2, …, xn be a sample of size n taken from a process. A bootstrap 
sample, denoted by *1x , 
*
2x , …, 
*
nx , is a sample of size n drawn with 
replacement from the original sample. From this bootstrap sample, the 
corresponding bootstrap pmkCˆ , denoted by 
*ˆ
pmkC , may be calculated. 
Suppose that we have B bootstrap samples, then we can obtain B bootstrap 
pmkCˆ ’s and order them from the smallest to largest, denoted by )1(ˆ *pmkC , 
)2(ˆ *pmkC , …, )(ˆ * BC pmk , which constitutes an empirical bootstrap 
distribution of Cpmk. Efron and Tibshirani (1986) indicated that a rough 
minimum of 1000 bootstrap samples is usually sufficient to compute 
reasonably accurate confidence interval estimates. Therefore, in this study, it 
is assumed that B = 1000 bootstrap samples are taken and then 1000 
bootstrap pmkCˆ ’s are calculated and ordered from the smallest to largest. 
The BCa bootstrap confidence interval was developed by Efron and 
Tibshirani (1988) to improve the performance of BCPB. Construction of the 
BCa bootstrap confidence interval depends on two numbers 0z  and a, 
where 0z  is the biased-correction factor and a is the acceleration factor. 
To obtain the biased-correction factor 0z , first use the ordered bootstrap 
distribution of *ˆ pmkC  to calculate the probability 
   p0 = Pr ( pmkpmk CC ˆˆ * ≤ ),      (3) 
where pmkCˆ  is the estimated value of Cpmk from the original sample. Then, 
it can be determined that  
   z0 = )( 01 p−Φ ,       (4) 
where )(⋅Φ  is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. 
Several ways are available to compute the acceleration factor a. A simple 
expression for a, which may be considered as the jackknife value of a 
statistic, is

The following example illustrates how the BCa bootstrap confidence 
interval of Cpmk can be applied in a working environment. 
Example Consider the cylindrical workpieces produced by an integrated 
numerical control lathe. Suppose that the diameter (in cm) of the workpieces 
is a key process characteristic with specifications 09.000.4 ±  cm. Five 
data values are measured from the process as follows: 3.96, 4.01, 3.99, 4.05 
and 3.97. The process capability index Cpmk is used as a quality indicator of 
the turning process of the numerical control lathe. Quality engineers would 
like to establish a 95% confidence interval for Cpmk such that the subsequent 
statistical hypothesis testing about the process quality can be conducted. 
Since the sample size is small and population distribution is unknown, 
bootstrap confidence intervals could be appropriate for this situation. From 
Eq. (2), 7963.0ˆ =pmkC . One thousand bootstrap samples are generated 
from the original sample, and their corresponding estimated values of Cpmk 
are calculated and ordered from the smallest to the largest, denoted by 
)1(ˆ *pmkC , )2(ˆ *pmkC , …, )1000(ˆ *pmkC .Since there are 644 )(ˆ * iC pmk ’s that 
are less than or equal to 0.7963, the probability p0 in Eq. (3) is 0.644. Then, 
Eq.(4) leads to that z0 = 0.3692. The values of )(ˆ ipmkC ’s are respectively 
that 8295.0ˆ )1( =pmkC , 6822.0ˆ )2( =pmkC , 7901.0ˆ )3( =pmkC ,

Step 6. Repeat Step 1 to Step 5 m times, each with a sample size n. Each 
replication generates one estimate of ρ . We then have m estimates, 
denoted by )1(ρˆ , )2(ρˆ , …, )(ˆ mρ .

Step 8. If ρ  is close to ρ , i.e. )(se ρρρ ≤− , then terminate the 
iterative procedure and accept the current value of Wρ . Otherwise, adjust 
the value of Wρ  and reapply the procedure from Step 1 through Step 8. 
In Step 8, we adjust the value of Wρ  if necessary. If ρ > ρ , we adjust 
Wρ  by taking ∆  as the decrement, where ρρ −=∆ . If ρ < ρ , we 
take ∆  as the increment in Wρ . 
    In the present paper, five levels of autocorrelation coefficient ρ  (i.e. 
-0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, 0.8) are planned to study the effect of lag-one 
autocorrelation on the BCa 95% bootstrap confidence interval of the index 
Cpmk. We only consider lag-one autocorrelation because the present paper is 
the first step to including correlation effect in the study of the bootstrap 
confidence interval of Cpmk. 
 
4. The simulation study 
    A simulation study on the behavior of the 95% BCa bootstrap 
confidence interval for estimating Cpmk, when data are correlated and follow 
a specific Burr distribution listed in Table 1, is described. Suppose that the 
target value of the process characteristic is 49, and the upper and lower 
specification limits are 61 and 40, respectively. For each combination of the 
Burr distribution and autocorrelation coefficient, four different simulations 
are run for the combinations of µ  = 50 or 52 and σ  = 2 or 3.5. Each 
combination of µ  and σ  represents a specific process capability. The 
process capabilities of the four processes span from good to relatively poor 
processes. The four processes and their corresponding values of Cpmk are 
listed in Table 2. For each process, a sample of size n = 25, 50, or 100 is 
drawn, and B = 1000 bootstrap samples with each of size n are drawn from 
the original sample. Consequently, a 95% BCa bootstrap confidence interval 
of Cpmk is constructed. It is then determined if the true value of Cpmk is 
covered by the 95% BCa bootstrap confidence interval.  
********** Table 2 is about here. ********** 
    This single simulation is then replicated N = 1000 times. A computer 
program in Visual Basic is coded to run the simulation. Thus, the percentage 
of times that the true value of Cpmk is covered by the 95% BCa bootstrap 
confidence interval, which is called the “coverage percentage” of the 
bootstrap confidence interval, can be obtained. In addition, an average 
length (or width) and standard deviation of the length of the bootstrap 
confidence interval is calculated based on the N = 1000 different trials. A 
complete simulation for a particular n, µ , σ , and ρ  is run under each 
Burr distribution listed in Table 1. 
 
5. Discussion of the simulation results 
    Simulation results of coverage percentage of the BCa bootstrap 
confidence interval and the resulting average interval length and the 
standard deviation of the interval length may be obtained by contacting the 
corresponding author. 
5.1. On the coverage percentage 
    Coverage percentage is generally a major indicator for evaluating the 
bootstrap confidence interval of an index. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
table of coverage percentage is obtained to study the effects of sample size, 
process capability (i.e. effects of µ  and σ ), non-normality (i.e. effects of 
3α  and 4α ) and lag-one autocorrelation on coverage percentage. With the 
use of ANOVA, it is assumed that the distribution of the output (i.e. the 
coverage percentage) is approximately normally distributed. Table 3 shows 
that the R-square value of the four main effects plus the two-way 
interactions is over 0.99360. (If only four main effects are included in the 
ANOVA, then the R-square value is just about 0.80.) It is noted that all of 
four main effects and some of two-way interactions are significant to the 
coverage percentage. By examining the column of mean square or F-value, 
we find that the influences of the significant two-way interactions are less 
than their corresponding main effects. For example, the F-value of “Process 
× Correlation” is 760.81, which is significantly less than the F-value of 
“Correlation” (i.e. 9770.08). Therefore, we only discuss the effects of main 
effects on the coverage percentage. Table 4 presents multiple comparisons 
for each level of the four main effects in Table 3 and the resulting average 
coverage percentage. The last column labeled “Group” shows the outcomes 
of multiple comparisons using least square t test with significance level 5%, 
in which different letters indicate that the means under comparison are 
significantly different. It can be seen, from Table 4(a), that a larger sample 
size always produces the better coverage percentage. Thus, when 
constructing the bootstrap confidence interval for Cpmk, the sample size 
should be as large as possible. From Table 4(b), it may be observed a 
process of which the mean is farther away from the target value always 
higher coverage percentage, a shorter average length and a smaller SD 
of the length of bootstrap confidence interval. This result is consistent 
with the general intuitive reasoning, i.e., the sample size should be as 
large as possible when bootstrap method is applied in interval 
estimation of Cpmk. However, a larger sample size always increases the 
time duration required for obtaining the corresponding interval. 
2. In the aspect of coverage percentage, the effect of process capability 
may be heavily influenced by correlation. Therefore, if there is 
correlation among the collected data, it is inappropriate to 
independently study the effect of process capability. 
3. If the population distribution is not far from normality, bootstrap 
confidence interval is still able to provide a satisfactory coverage 
percentage, average interval length and the standard deviation of 
interval length for Cpmk. That is, except that data are heavily skewed, 
the bootstrap method generally produces a satisfactory confidence 
interval for Cpmk. 
4. If there is correlation among the collected data, the traditional 
bootstrap method may not be appropriate for constructing the 
confidence interval for Cpmk, because highly correlated data always 
produce a large variability in the bootstrap distribution, which 
certainly leads to a very low coverage percentage. One of “possible” 
reasons for this situation is that the capability index Cpmk itself does not 
involve the measurement of correlation. Thus, before applying the 
bootstrap method for interval estimation of Cpmk, one should examine 
the autocorrelation in the data. If the data are independent, then the 
traditional bootstrap method can reach a satisfactory confidence 
interval for Cpmk; however, if the data are correlated, then the 
traditional bootstrap method can not be applied for interval estimation 
of Cpmk. Therefore, future research can be directed toward developing 
the capability index Cpmk for correlated data and constructing its 
confidence interval.
