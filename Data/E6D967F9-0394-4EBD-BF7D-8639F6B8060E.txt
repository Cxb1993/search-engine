英文摘要 (Abstract in English) 
By the project support, we have developed:  
 (1) An approach to retrieving 1-D subwavelength feature variation from far-field irradiance 
measurement precision.  It was numerically verified could have precision better than 1 nm.  
The relations between 1-D subwavelength feature variation and corresponding far-field 
diffraction pattern was investigated and provides good far-field characteristics in measuring 
1-D subwavelength feature variation.  （published in Optics Letters） 
(2) A tunable asymmetrically embedded-aperture interferometer configuration to enhance 
detection sensitivity of 1-D subwavelength variation measurement at arbitrary aperture width. 
   (published in JOSA A) 
(3) A multi-detector, embedded-aperture interferometer configuration accompanies blind signal 
separation method to recover coupled 2-D subwavelength variation information of a 
rectangular aperture with far-field irradiance measurement with error ratio below 1%.  
(Published in JOSA A) 
(4) By using the approach to retrieve 1-D subwavelength variation from far-field irradiance 
measurement, a constructed-aperture measurement system behaving as an optical ruler was 
proposed could measure the marginal roughness of the test sample with error ratio below 3%. 
(to be published in Optics Communications)

However, as the roadmap of investigation shown below that we have figured out one year 
ago, there remains a lot of works for further investigation
