計畫英文摘要 
Image modeling is a foundation for many image processing applications. 
Markov Random Field (MRF) is an important image model and has been 
successfully applied to the fields of pattern recognition and image analysis such 
as the applications of texture analysis and image segmentation. The model of 
MRF is very much related to the energy concept. Besag first introduced the 
concept of Gibb’s energy from the thermal dynamics into the field of picture 
modeling. Ten years later, Geman provided the real data for the energy of line 
fields. MRF has thus been successfully applied to many applications. 
C.C. Chen [1] has pointed out the verification difficulty of the NRF 
research: the research results from the published literature are usually not 
reproducible by different researchers. Chen listed the following three reasons 
for this problem: (1) the involved mathematic equations are not clearly defined 
(2) the computation algorithm is not clearly described (3) the involved 
parameters in the algorithms are not clearly listed. Considering this problem 
has not been improved for these 18 years, we propose to achieve the parametric 
optimization for Markov Random Field by using energy criterion in this project. 
Using energy criterion, we shall clearly define the involved mathematic 
equations, processing algorithms, and the involved parameters. Accordingly, 
we shall verify our obtained parameters by image restoration. 
Key words: Markov random field, Image restoration, Line field.

Abstract. The emergence of imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging sometimes can replace conventional radiography in osteoporosis diagnosis. 
The new technologies call for more elaborate techniques such as efficient image 
segmentation by the active contour (digital snake) method using gradient vector flow 
to overcome the leakage at weak boundaries. The gradient vector flow can be 
approximated by distance transform to speed up the execution. Therefore, an accurate 
and fast distance transformation is a powerful tool for osteoporosis diagnosis. Up to 
present, only the chessboard (8-Neighbor) distance has been applied to this 
approximation for its simple computation structure. The purpose of this paper is thus 
to develop an error-free Euclidean distance transform algorithm with the same simple 
computation structure to replace the coarser chessboard distance.  
Keywords: Active contour, Osteoporosis diagnosis, Distance transform, 
Euclidean distance. 
1   Introduction 
The detection of morphological change in trabecular thickness and cartilage defects 
between bones are important tasks for osteoporosis diagnosis. This detection work is 
still one of the most challenging image understanding tasks. For instance, the cartilage 
surface can be easily obscured by surrounding tissues of similar water content [1]. 
Also, the boundary between two cartilages may be too weak to be distinguished in 
MR images and may not be noticed by human observers. The emergence of imaging 
technologies such as MR imaging call for more elaborate techniques for measuring 
structural thickness.  
A creative tool for vision functions called Snakes to model deformable contours have 
been developed for boundary detection for non-rigid objects. With the help of the 
enhanced diffusion map, the gradient vector flow (GVF) snakes sensitivity to 
overcome leakage at weak boundaries is successful [1]. However, the execution speed 
is unacceptably slow. To speed up this execution, Chi et al. [2] uses chessboard 
2 Computation Strategies 
In contrast to the city block distance or the chessboard distance, the Euclidean 
distance is measured on a setting of irregular tracks, which may vary among every 
different pair of pixels. In such case, pixels may not be able to pass through its 
neighbors for reaching the interested pixels. Therefore, the neighboring pixels (U-
neighbor and L-neighbor) may provide incorrect information to the working pixel (P-
pixel ) as illustrated in Fig. 1. The working pixel thus has an incorrect answer for 
distance. As a result, the error propagates and causes more errors.  
We therefore propose an off-line prepared table to correct the above mentioned 
information. For on-line efficiency a looking-up condition is further defined to avoid 
unnecessary looking-up since in many situations the neighboring information is 
sufficient for the Euclidean distance. A schematic diagram for our strategy to achieve 
the correction answer and maintain the same local computation structure as city block 
distance is illustrated in Fig. 2.

4. Recursive Algorithm 
The Euclidean distance is computed in two scans. In each scan, the Euclidean distance 
for a current pixel is recursively computed by its previous (for that specific scan) two 
neighboring pixel's distance records and a further check-up in the candidates region 
for correction if necessary. Applying the principle of mathematical induction to the 
pixels, the validity of error-free quadrant for a current pixel is guaranteed by the 
corresponding validity for its two previous neighbors. Similarly, applying the 
induction to the scans again, the error-free Euclidean distance for the whole picture is 
accordingly achieved in this double recursive computation structure. We have our 
algorithm summarized below.

5 Mathematical Proof  
The correct distance can be proved by mathematical deduction. Owing to the 
limitation of the space, only a sketch of the proof is provided with the help of the 
explanatory diagrams in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.  
 
Initial procedure: This is checked by the correctness of the first pixel. 
Deduction procedure: the correctness for the present (working) pixel can be ensured 
by the correctness of the all previous pixels. The all previous pixels obviously include 
the upper and left neighboring pixels. Thus, exploiting the deduction schemes in 
Figure 2, the deduction procedure is verified.  
Therefore, the correctness of the whole picture is verified according to mathematical 
deduction. 
 However, some concepts involved in the proof are not very straightforward such 
as the notion of correctness. To be more precise, the above mentioned correctness is 
confined to the region for the field of view corresponding to the involved scan. More 
clearly, the shaded region between A and B in Fig. 4-(a) is one example of candidate 
region in the field of view for the first scan (from left to right in the first supper scan). 
The four fields for different scans are illustrated in Fig. 4-(b).
