Abstract 
We proposed a novel numerical design method based on a spiraling search algorithm and 
applied to design a wide angular visible antireflection (AR) coating with an incident angle up to 
50o from the normal. Only a two-material multilayer system with high- and low-index is used in 
the design. It is shown that the maximum visible reflectivity and maximum average angular 
visible spectral reflectivity can be reduced to below 1.26 and 1.06%, respectively, and that the 
total average wide-angle visible spectral reflectivity can be reduced to lower than 0.33%. Not 
only is the wide-angle visible AR performance in the designed range very acceptable, but it is 
found that the visible reflectivity for that incident angle beyond than 50o can also be decreased; 
that is, the wide-angle visible AR design can yield an omnidirectional antireflective effect for all 
incident angles ranging from 0 to 90o.

Introduction 
AR coating belongs to the most important optical coating designs, and has had the greatest 
impact on optics [1, 2]. It makes up more than 50% of the total optical thin-film market [3]. The 
widely uses of AR coating in optical and optoelectronic systems is mainly due to it can effective 
reduce the undesired surface reflection and/or increase the transmittance of optical system. A 
broadband visible AR coating is essential to an optical display system to eliminate the ghost 
image to increase the contrast of optical image. However, most visible AR coatings are designed 
for the normal incidence [4-7]. It is a difficult task to design a very low-loss broadband visible 
AR coating over a wide range of incident angles since the reflectance of dielectric thin film at 
large incident angle has a strong polarization effect, which leads to the AR coating design should 
simultaneously suit for two different effective substrate indices of the s- and p-polarization over a 
wideband visible spectral region.

MF is no longer improved in one pass of all the layers, the spiraling operation is terminated. 
D) To further simplify the design structure and refine the AR performance, an eliminating 
operation is used afterward, which can be carried out using the different types: 
(a) Eliminate from the thin layer to the thick layer. 
(b) Eliminate from the thick layer to the thin layer. 
(c) Eliminate from the first layer to the last layer. 
(d) Eliminate from the last layer to the first layer. 
When eliminating a layer, we may merge the layers of the same refractive index to form a 
new layer, and then restart the spiraling adjusting search to obtain a lower minimum MF. 
Once the MF is refined using an eliminating operation, the layer number is reduced, a new 
design is obtained, and a new pass of the eliminating operation is then carried out. If the MF 
is no longer refined in one pass of all the layers, the eliminating operation is completed 
E) The reflectivity of the large incident angle generally becomes increase at the long-wavelength 
spectral region. To suppress this tail effect to improve the wide angular AR performance, an 
additional spiraling search process with a modified merit function MF’ is than used, in which 
the weighting of wavelengths greater than 730 nm in eq. (1) is replaced by w (>1), and the 
MF’ is given by

Restarting the spiral search of the design obtained in step (C), and the desired design is 
considered to be achieved if MF' is no longer reduced in a pass in all layers. 
 
Results and Discussions 
To demonstrate the spiraling search algorithm, we applied the spiral search technique to design 
a wide-angular visible AR coating for the incident angle lying in 0-50o using a two-material 
20-layer system starting with a total physical thickness of 1080 nm and the refractive indices 
coded as nH-nL-nH-nL-..., here nH and nL were the high- and low-index of film materials TiO2 and 
MgF2 used in the design, respectively. Dispersion of optical constants of the film materials and 
BK7 glass substrate shown in Table I [13] were taken into account in the calculations. The 
adjusting thickness used for the spiral search was 0.1 nm. After 134 passes of spiral search 
operations, and with the w=3.8 in the additional spiral operation, the results were obtained and 
are shown in Figs. 2-4.
