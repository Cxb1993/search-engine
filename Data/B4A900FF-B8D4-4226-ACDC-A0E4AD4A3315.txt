英文摘要
In this project, the construction of one-to-many node-disjoint paths in a star
network will be studied. Given a source node s and another m distinct destination
nodes d1, d2, …, dm, we will construct m node-disjoint paths from s to d1, d2, …, dm,
respectively, in an n-dimensional star network so that their maximal length is
minimized in the worst case, where 1mn1. As a by-product, the Rabin numbers of
star networks are obtained. The Rabin number of a network W is the minimum l so
that for any+1 distinct nodes s, d1, d2, …, dof W, there exist node-disjoint paths
from s to d1, d2, …, d, respectively, whose maximal length is not greater than l, where
is the node connectivity of W.

3naturally from the study of routing, reliability, and fault tolerance in parallel and distributed
systems. Throughout this project, processor and node are used interchangeably.
In order to reduce the transmission latency, disjoint paths are desired to have their maximal
length minimized. In an Sn, m disjoint paths from one source node to other m distinct destination
nodes were constructed in [21] so that their maximal length is not greater than 3(n1)/2+2,
where mn1 and 3(n1)/2is the diameter. In this project, m disjoint paths from one source
node to other n distinct destination nodes are constructed in an n-cube so that their maximal
length is not greater than3(n1)/2, which is minimized in the worst case.
三、文獻探討
There are three categories of disjoint paths, i.e., one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
Suppose that W is a network with connectivity. According to Menger's theorem [4], there exist
disjoint paths between every two distinct nodes of W. They belong to the one-to-one category.
Many one-to-one disjoint paths constructed for a variety of networks can be found in the
literature [6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34-36, 41, 42]. On the other hand, according to
Theorem 2.6 in [3], there exist disjoint paths from one node to another distinct nodes in W.
They belong to the one-to-many category. One-to-many disjoint paths were first studied in [39]
where the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) was proposed on the hypercube. Taking
advantages of disjoint paths, the IDA has numerous potential applications to secure and
fault-tolerant storage and transmission of information. Some examples of one-to-many disjoint
paths can be found in [6, 9, 12-14, 21, 26-30, 34, 35, 39].
Many-to-many disjoint paths (or named set-to-set disjoint paths), which connect two sets of
nodes in W, can be found in [17-20]. According to Menger’s theorem [4], the m disjoint paths for
5shortest. Then procedure merge({P1, P2, …, Pm1}, {Q1, Q2, …, Qm}) can produce
disjoint paths R1, R2,…, Rm so that each of them is either shortest or second shortest.
In [27], we obtain procedure container(w, x, y) by slightly modifying the procedure proposed
in [8]. By executing procedure container(w, x, y), we can obtain w-wide container Cw(x, y) so that
each path in Cw(x, y) is either shortest or second shortest. Please see [27] for the detailed
description of the procedure container(w, x, y). The time complexity of procedure container(w, x,
y) is bounded above by O(n2logn) in the worst case.
Finally, we give the procedure dpaths(s, d1, d2, …, dm) below for constructing disjoint paths
from s to d1, d2, …, dm , respectively, so that each of them is either shortest or second shortest.
Procedure dpaths(s, d1, d2, …, dm).
Step 1. Construct P1 as a shortest path from s to d1.
Step 2. For i=2, 3,…, m, do {
Obtain Ci(i, s, di)={Q1, Q2,…, Qi} by executing procedure container(i, s, di).
Obtain R1, R2, …, Ri by executing procedure merge({P1, P2, …, Pi1}, {Q1,
Q2,…, Qi}).
Reconstruct P1, P2,…, Pi as R1, R2,…, Ri, respectively. }
Step 3. Return P1, P2,…, Pm.
We note that the Step 2 of procedure dpaths(s, d1, d2, …, dm) is a loop statement, which will
do the construction statements for i=2, i=3, …, and i=m sequentially. Since each of the resulting
disjoint pahts P1, P2, …, Pm is either shortest or second shortest, their maximal length is not
greater than the diameter of Sn plus one. Hence, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Suppose that s, d1, d2, …, dm are m+1 distinct nodes of an n-dimensional star
network, where mn1 and n3. There are m disjoint paths from s to d1, d2, …, dm,
respectively, whose maximal length is not greater than 3(n1)/2+1, where
3(n1)/2is the diameter.
It was shown in [32] that there exist n distinct nodes s, d1, d2, …, dn1 of Sn so that any n1
disjoint paths from s to d1, d2, …, dn1, respectively, have maximal length at least 3(n1)/2+1.
Since Theorem 1 provides an upper bound3(n1)/2+1 for the Rabin number of Sn, we have the
following corollary.
Corollary 1. The Rabin number of an n-dimensional star network is3(n1)/2+1 for n3.
五、結果與討論
During the execution of this project, we obtain deeper knowledge about star networks,
containers, node-disjoint paths, and fault tolerant routing techniques. Besides, our research
abilities are improved. As shown in [27], m node-disjoint paths from one source node to other m
distinct destination nodes were constructed in an n-dimensional star network so that their
maximal length is minimized in the worst case, where mn1. As a by-product, the Rabin
numbers of star networks are obtained.
