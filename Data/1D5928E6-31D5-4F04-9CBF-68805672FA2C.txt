Two parameters, Ω  and ω , are obtained 
by the solvability condition (Nayfeh, 1981), 
leading to

geometric ( λ ), flow ( 0,β θ ) and sediment

the domain into ‘stable’ and ‘unstable’ 
regions, where ( , )c cβ λ  are defined as the 
minimum value of β  for bed instability and 
the corresponding wavenumber, respectively. 
Linear solutions severely suffer from the lack 
of precision. Spatially, they fail to describe 
the observed troughs and diagonal fronts. In 
addition, the maximum scour and deposition 
occur at the same cross section, which is 
against reality. Temporally, positive values of 
Ω  imply continual growth of alternate bars. 
It is thus a matter of time before the solutions 
go out of control, which is the most 
inadequate feature of the linear solution.

( , )β λ  is replaced by ( , )c cβ λ , the 
corresponding values of ( , )ωΩ  are given by

the multiple scale method. At ( )O ε , the

At )( 2/3εO , the solutions of the

presented to counteract the secular terms; the

The superscript ‘2’ denotes 2p =  and the 
subscripts ‘2’ and ‘0’ denote solutions for the 
‘second’ and ‘zero’ harmonics; ‘ p ’ and ‘ h ’ 
in the subscript denote ‘particular’ and 
‘homogeneous’ solutions. Incorporation of 
homogeneous solutions is required to satisfy 
the boundary conditions, which are main 
origins of the forcing effect. Grouping the 
terms with the same harmonics ends up 
solving 11 systems of equations, which can 
be expressed as 
2 2 2j j j=A X B    1 ~ 11j =  (20)
For the homogeneous solutions, the variables 
with a second harmonic are first solved. The

Substituting (19a) into (21), and using the 
particular solutions, it is possible to solve the 
rest of the components in 20hX . Thus, a 
complete set of solutions for 2( )O δ  is 
obtained. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Nonlinear Solutions of Free Bars 
 
The linear and nonlinear solutions of 
bed deformation over three wavelengths of 
the alternate bars are shown in Figures 3a and 
3b, respectively, where the perturbed term 
η′  is expanded to 
1
2( )O ε for the linear 
solution and ( )O ε  for the nonlinear solution. 
The linear result is inappropriate for 
describing the natural features of alternate 
bars because: (1) it does not show diagonal 
fronts and the deep pools at their downstream 
faces; (2) the maximum deposition and scour

To see whether the present model, while 
predicting simultaneously the bar wavelength 
and height, still holds a fair accuracy, the 
predicted results of alternate bar wavenumber 
and bar height are plotted against the 
observed results in Figures 5a and 5b, 
respectively. Aside from the line of perfect 
agreement, two other solid lines correspond 
to the range of error between –20% ~ 60% in 
Figure 5a and –60% ~ 20% in Figure 5b. A 
total of 66 experimental data are shown in 
Figure 5. In Figure 5a, more than 77% of the 
data fall within the –20% ~ 60% error range, 
indicating an overall trend of overestimation. 
A scatter of data with errors > 60% shows 
that the present model may at times 
overestimate the wavenumber by 3~5 times. 
On the other hand, for the alternate (or 
maximum) bar height in Figure 5b, 79% of 
the data fall within the –60% ~ 20% error 
range, indicating an overall trend of 
underestimation. 
The wide range of prediction errors has 
been also reported in previous studies. In this 
study, such errors still exist although the 
range of error has been significantly reduced, 
especially for the prediction of bar height. A 
comparison of wavenumber prediction errors 
associated with various models is 
summarized in Table 1. The possible causes 
for these prediction errors include: (1) 
Misusage of shallow water equations for 
deep flow problems; (2) Neglecting 
suspended load could often over-predicts bed 
stability; (3) The helical flow effect is not 
taken into account. The alternating pattern of 
fronts and pools causes distortion of 
streamlines and thus results in the secondary 
flows. The importance of secondary flows in 
meandering channels is well known, but 
remains both qualitatively and quantitatively 
vague concerning the alternate bars in 
straight channels, which will be addressed in 
the third year. 
3.2. Nonlinear Solutions of Forced Bars 
 
Fig. 6. Comparison between (a) experimental 
result, (b) linear and (c) nonlinear 
solutions of bed deformation in our 
run S6 
The ability of the linear model, with the 
helical flow effect incorporated, in predicting 
various types of forced bedform has been 
shown in our previous work (Wu and Yeh, 
2005). On this basis, we further investigate 
the microscopic corrections due to the 
nonlinear effects. The linear and nonlinear 
solutions for our run S6 and Bittner’s run 
C1-11, along with the experimental results, 
are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. In 
Figure 6, no apparent change is found by 
introducing the second-order solutions. All 
scour and deposition occur at very similar 
 8
location where its maximum occurs. This is 
most obvious at the distance *x = 170, 330, 
and 490 cm where a rise is predicted as a 
corresponding drop, or a secondary trough, is 
found. The second harmonic from solutions 
at 2( )O δ  fairly describes such drops but 
underestimate the primary troughs. 
For lateral profiles, both solutions agree 
well with the results of our run S6 (Figure 9). 
In the narrowest section, however, the scour 
depth is underestimated by ~0.6cm at the 
center although the general concave profile is 
captured. Such error could be caused by 
relaxing the no-slip boundary conditions, as 
will be discussed later. For Bittner’s run 
C1-11 (Figure 10), the data measured over 
four cycles are presented with a mean value 
and error bars showing the range of observed 
values. A similar error is found in the 
prediction of the narrowest sections. In the 
narrowest sections, the deformation of the 
bed profiles is rather weak. An overall form 
of a convex can however be seen. Both linear 
and nonlinear solutions give the prediction of 
the convex form at the center but with 
exaggerated curvature of the convex. The 
maximum deviation is ~0.7cm. Hence, at the 
narrowest section, the scour depth is 
underestimated. However, this is 
compensated by the excessive erosion 
predicted at the two sides. At the widest 
section, on the other hand, the incorporation 
of the nonlinear solutions gives a positive 
correction toward reality. The linear solutions 
showed greater bar heights than the actual 
value, also the locations for the occurrence of 
the maximum bar height are shifted toward 
the centerline. Both defects are reduced with 
the nonlinear effects considered. The 
comparison at the narrowest sections for both 
experimental studies (Figures 9b and 10b) 
shows that the present model tends to 
underestimate the scour depth near the 
centerline but overestimate that near the bank. 
Such errors could arise from neglecting the 
no-slip boundary condition at the sidewalls 
whose effect becomes more important in the 
narrow sections (Wu and Yeh, 2005).

A Novel HMA for Optimization of Mandatory Environmental Flows

ABSTRACT 
We present a novel HMA (Histogram Matching 
Approach) for optimization of the mandatory 
environmental flows. The HMA uses the degree of 
histogram dissimilarity as a metric for impact 
assessment, which is based on the quadratic-form 
distance between the frequency vectors of the pre- 
and post-impact histograms weighted by a specified 
similarity matrix. The HMA is coupled with an 
aggregated multiobjective optimization GA (genetic 
algorithm) and applied to a case study on the 
Kaoping diversion weir (Taiwan) for determining the 
optimal environmental flow scheme that balances the 
ecosystem and human needs objectives. We compare 
the performances of the HMA and existing RVA 
(Range of Variability Approach). We also employ 
three types of similarity function to investigate their 
effect on the outcomes of the HMA. The results 
reveal that the HMA consistently outperforms the 
RVA in preserving the natural flow variability 
regardless of what type of similarity function is used. 
However, no single type of similarity function can be 
found that would simultaneously best preserve the 
natural patterns of 32 IHA (Indicators of Hydrologic 
Alteration).

1. INTRODUCTION 
Rivers downstream of reservoir and/or weir operation 
facilities typically experience a loss of natural flow 
variability, leading to alterations of geomorphic 
processes, physical habitat, nutrient cycling, water 
quality, temperature, and biotic interactions, thus 
deteriorating the health of the riverine ecosystem. In 
an effort to mitigate these impacts and support 
sustainable ecosystems, a managed release of water 
to meet the instream flow requirements (or termed 
‘environmental flows’) is currently mandated by the 
governmental and natural resources agencies in many 
nations around the world. 
Determining the environmental flows for the riverine 
ecosystems continues to be a challenge for 
contemporary scientists and natural resources 
managers. A key issue regarding the definition of 
environmental flows is to determine how much of the 
original flow regime should continue to flow down a 
river and onto its floodplains in order to maintain the 
valued features of an ecosystem. Over the last decade, 
the concept of ‘natural flow regime’ has been 
emerging as a paradigm for river management (Poff 
et al., 1997), which recognizes the full range of 
natural flow variability as a primary driving force for 
sustaining the ecological health of a river. To 
characterize the natural and altered flow regimes, a 
number of hydrologic index systems have been 
proposed. A thorough review can be found in Olden 
and Poff (2003). Richter et al. (1996) adopted 32 
hydrologic parameters to develop a suite of IHA 
(Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration). The 32 
ecologically relevant IHA are categorized by five 
groups of hydrologic features, i.e., flow magnitude, 
duration, timing, frequency, and rate of change. 
The IHA have become increasingly popular tools for 
river management. Abundant examples can be found 
where researchers have employed the IHA to assess 
the hydrologic changes induced by flow regulations, 
as demonstrated by the IHA Applications Database 
(The Nature Conservancy, 2005). Despite the 
popularity of IHA, studies that incorporated the 
natural flow regime to optimizing water release 
strategies were rarely reported, primarily due to a 
lack of widely accepted methodology for quantifying 
the ecological fitness of environmental flows. Only 
recently, incorporation of the regime-based 
environmental flows in water resources and 
ecosystem management becomes practicable with the 
aid of the RVA (Range of Variability Approach) (see 
Shiau and Wu, 2004a, 2004b, 2006, 2007a, 2007b). 
The RVA employs the natural (or pre-impact) flow 
series to establish the IHA target ranges (Richter et al., 
1997). The management goal is to recommend 
environmental flow schemes that would attain the 
target ranges as frequently as the natural flow series. 
Richter et al. (1998) further suggested an IHA target 
range bracketed by the 25th- and 75th-percentile 
values, implying that 50% of the pre-impact years 
would have the values of the hydrologic parameter 
within the target range. To evaluate the deviation of

3. CASE STUDY 
3.1 Overview of Kaoping Diversion Weir 
The Kaoping diversion weir is located in the 
midstream of Kaoping Creek, southern Taiwan. Its 
alluvial plain is a major agricultural area. To mitigate 
the impacts of groundwater overdraft and provide an 
alternative source of water supply, construction of the 
Kaoping diversion weir was initiated in 1992 and 
completed in 1999. The monthly flow characteristics 
(1951−2004) of the Lilin Bridge gauge station, 
located immediately above the weir site, exhibit a 
highly fluctuating and uneven flow pattern. The 
water-supply objectives of the diversion weir are to 
meet the agricultural and domestic water demands. 
Currently a minimum flow (= 9.5 m3/s) is released 
from the Kaoping diversion weir for protecting the 
downstream water quality (WCA, 2000), which is 
unlikely to create a sufficient resemblance to the 
natural flows (Shiau and Wu, 2006). Since the 
post-diversion flows vary as a function of the 
environmental flow prescriptions, a weir operation 
model is used to simulate the flow series diverted for 
water supplies and released for ecosystem 
preservation. 
 
3.2 Weir Operation Model 
The system of flows in the weir operation model is 
depicted in Figure 3, where two flow criteria are to be 
met at time t , i.e., the projected diversions tPDQ  and 
environmental flows tEFQ ; tIQ  denotes the natural (or 
pre-diversion) inflow; tADQ  denotes the amount of 
flow actually diverted for water supplies; tOQ  
denotes the post-diversion outflow. The projected 
monthly diversions tPDQ  are summarized in Shiau 
and Wu (2007b), and the values of tEFQ  are the only 
decision variable to be specified. A total of twelve 
t
EFQ  values are to be prescribed for the monthly 
varying environmental flow scheme. The operational 
rules are given by

These operational rules are currently implemented by 
the Water Resources Agency of Taiwan with a 
constant value of tEFQ  (= 9.5 m
3/s). Here we modify 
the operational rules by allowing the values of tEFQ  
to vary monthly. The daily flows at the Lilin Bridge 
gauge station (1951−2004) are used in the simulation 
as the inflow series tIQ . The post-diversion series, 
t
OQ , are used to assess the degree of flow regime 
alteration. The flow series actually diverted for 
human demands, tADQ , are used to evaluate the water 
supply deficit.

flow regime alteration associated with these four 
AMOGA-based optimal environmental flow schemes 
are relatively low. Although such a result may have to 
imply that the RVA is as useful as HMA for finding 
the optimal environmental flows, the strength of the 
HMA becomes apparent as we look at the 
post-optimal series of IHA. Two examples are given 
below to demonstrate this. 
Figure 4a shows the natural and post-optimal series 
of monthly flows in December, obtained using both 
the RVA and HMA with a pulse similarity (referred to 
as HMA-pulse hereinafter). The post-optimal series 
based on the HMA-pulse closely resembles to the 
pattern of natural series, while the post-optimal series 
based on the RVA exhibits much less variability 
despite that 50% of the data points are within the 
target range. Most of these within-target data points 
obtained with the RVA have values that are just 
passing the lower target. Moreover, the percentage 
above the upper target is reduced to 11% while that 
below the lower target is increased to 39%. The 
frequency histograms (Figure 4b) further reveal that 
the post-optimal series based on the HMA-pulse 
closely follows the natural distribution, whereas 65% 
of the RVA-based post-optimal series are 
concentrated in the second class, which is a 37% over 
the corresponding natural frequency and 24% over 
the post-optimal frequencies resulting from both the 
HMA-linear and -exponential.

As the second example, the natural and post-optimal 
series of annual mean low-pulse durations are shown 
in Figure 5a. The post-optimal series obtained with 
the HMA-linear exhibits a reasonably good 
resemblance to the natural series. The RVA-based 
post-optimal series of low-pulse durations is not as 
disturbed as that of monthly flows in December, with 
most of the RVA-based results being slightly greater 
than the corresponding values obtained with the 
HMA-linear. As a result, the frequency of the 
RVA-based post-optimal series in the fourth class is 
higher than the corresponding HMA-based 
post-optimal frequencies (Figure 5b), while the 
RVA-based post-optimal frequency in the first class is 
consistently lower than the corresponding 
HMA-based post-optimal frequencies.

The above two examples demonstrate that the HMA 
outperforms the RVA in preserving the natural flow 
variability, which is achieved at the cost of greater 
water-supply deficits, as revealed by the slightly 
greater values of SR associated with the HMA (i.e., 
ranging from 30.9 to 34.1%) than the RVA-based 
value of SR (= 29.2%). Such minor degradation in 
human needs fitness, however, may be overlooked as 
we compare the statistics of DQ derived from the 
RVA- and HMA-based post-optimal series of 32 IHA.
