Abstract 
 
Following power market deregulation 
and the proposed standard market design, the 
activities of cross boundary power 
transactions are increased significantly. 
Traditional company based stability analysis 
can not satisfy today’s operating environment. 
However, simulating the entire 
interconnection power system may exceed 
the capacity of existing commercial stability 
analysis software. Fortunately, most of the 
stability problems are started from the local 
level. One will be able to avoid most of the 
system wide stability issues by mitigating the 
problems in the early stage. Based on 
eigenvector decompositions of the Jacobian, 
this plan proposes a new algorithm for 
performing the dynamic stability problem for 
a large interconnected power system. Using 
Python and MATLAB to build an integrated 
simulation environment around PSS/E not 
only overcomes the large-scale power system 
problem but also shortens the simulation time. 
The proposed method will be verified on the 
Taiwan Power Company and Southwest 
Power Pool (SPP) system, which has close to 
30,000 buses.

1. Introduction 
As social advancement and industry 
development have increased power 
consumption, the demand for power on the 
North America continent has been doubling 
every ten years since the invention of the 
induction motor by Nikola in 1888 [1]. Due 
to the utility deregulation, the complexity of 
the power system connecting generators and 
users across the US and Canada has 
increased dramatically as independent system 
operators transfer increasing amounts of 
power to each other. Controlling and 
managing this huge and complex power 
system has therefore become an engineering 
challenge. Moreover, even though many 
software packages are available to assist 
engineers with these tasks, no available 
commercial software enables to simulate the 
entire eastern interconnection system.

Therefore, the diagonal term of δ

inserted into the diagonal elements. 
In addition to the traditional Jacobian 
matrix solution [4], another technique can be 
used to account for the power system losses. 
For the purposes of this proposed application, 
this derivation [5] is deduced and modified 
during the final phase of the development.

Solving the sensitivity area requires 
injection of 1MW power into the fault bus, 
followed by calculation of the power flow 
difference in each branch to identify those 
branches with larger variations and find the 
buses in their two ends. For this method, the 
power flow must first be solved; however, if 
the system is too large, an alternative method 
can be used to find the nearest n layers of 
buses from the fault bus, which then become 
the sensitivity area.

 (2) The next step is the spectral graph

advance preparation of the power flow data, 
the first step in which is partitioning the SPP 
system. Some of the corresponding 
partitioning processes and results are shown 
in figure 2. 
The gray area of figure 2 shows the final 
subareas, the tip elements of the binary tree. 
The final result is shown in figure 3. 
Once the sensitivity area is calculated, 
the final cutting areas are the subareas that 
cover the sensitivity area. For example, if the 
fault bus is bus 25044, we start from the fault 
bus and expand out 15 layers of buses. We 
then choose both the fault bus and 15 layers 
of buses for the sensitivity area. If we do not 
weight the sensitivity area in the original 
system, we obtain the final cutting areas 
shown in the black blocks in figure 3. 
We also deduce another partition 
process by first calculating the Laplacian 
matrix of the sensitivity area and then 
directly weighting the Laplacian matrix to the 
original system. The final Jacobian matrix 
can now apply to any partitioning method. As 
long as the weighting is not large, both 
methods are feasible and their results are 
almost identical. After partitioning, we must 
first run the power flow, after which our 
program will assign a swing bus if the 
separated area does not include the swing bus 
from the original system. 
4.2 Single fault scenarios 
To verify the proposed algorithm, six 
independent faults at different locations were 
studied. Because of the security issue, the 
map will not be shown but the relative 
locations of the faults are shown in Fig. 4. 
The adjustable parameters chosen for 
the simulation are explained below: 
w = 1 (which is similar to no weighting). 
We then use the original Jacobian matrix to 
partition the power system. 
N = 100, because the total number of 
buses in the SPP system is 29,528. Every 
subarea will then be around 100 buses. 
C = 0.5. If the coupling of the next two 
subareas is tight, this parameter can avoid 
forward recursive partitioning. 
During data validation, the first two 
seconds of stability simulation are a no-fault 
test. We create a fault in two seconds and 
keep it 0.0833 seconds (5 cycles), after which 
we allow the simulation to run to 15 seconds. 
After all stability cases have been simulated, 
we compare all the simulation graphs and list 
the results in Table I. 
As shown in Figures 5 and 8, 6 and 9, 
and 7 and 10, respectively, some simulation 
results for the separated system are almost 
the same as those for the original system, 
some are similar, and some are different. 
Because the four simulation results on fault 
bus 25044 are the same as those for the 
original system and fault bus 87456 is near 
the boundary, we choose both cases to 
compare simulation time. Our simulation 
environment is a laptop with 2.4G Hz CPU, 
512MB RAM and Microsoft Windows XP 
Home Edition. The comparative results for 
the simulation time of dynamic stability are 
listed in Table II. 
The simulation results indicate that the 
safest method is to choose 30 layers of buses 
near the fault in the SPP system. Their 
simulations results are almost the same as the 
original system. However, only partitioning 
eight layers of buses would produce a similar 
simulation result as for the whole system if 
the fault is far away from boundary. 
4.3 Multiple faults scenarios 
As described below, three multiple 
faults cases are created to study two distant 
faults and two near-by faults scenarios:  
Case 1: Two faults occur simultaneously 
in load bus 54121 and generator bus 87456. 
Case 2: Two faults occur simultaneously 
in load bus 64895 and load bus 83904. 
Case 3: Two faults occur simultaneously 
in load bus 31426 and generator bus 25044. 
The simulation results are shown in 
Table III. A comparison of the single and 
double fault test results shows that the double 
faults correspond to the single fault. Even 
though the fit is not 100%, the subsystem 
simulation is similar to the original whole 
system.
