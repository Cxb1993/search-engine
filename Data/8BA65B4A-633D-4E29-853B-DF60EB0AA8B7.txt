effectively convert to the kinetic energy. However, if there 
has an abrupt flow area change, it would cause a significant 
loss. 
 
Single-phase pressure loss coefficient 
For a single-phase flow, the pressure loss is normally in 
terms of the contraction loss coefficient (K) and 
multiplication of kinetic energy of the flow: 
2 2
2 2c
K u KGP ρ
ρ
∆ = =
                        (1)  
Where σA is the passage cross section area ratio and 0 < σA 
< 1, mass flux (G) and velocity (u) are calculated based on 
the smaller cross sectional area of the outlet tube. The value 
of K is related to the Reynolds number and contraction ratio, 
and it is close to 0.5 and 1.0 with a very small cross area 
ratio (σA < 0.05) (Kays, 1984). 
As the flow approaches the contraction area, the flow 
separates from the inner wall and eddy zones are developed 
just at the front of transitional cross section. The contracted 
flow forms itself into a small jet flow pattern with the 
narrowest cross section of the jet being called vena-
contracta which is located immediately after the transition 
cross section. In the contracted flow region the static 
pressure decreases rapidly than the fully developed flow at 
the upstream and downstream. After the ventral-contracta, 
the pressure gradually increases and reaches its maximum, 
and then merges into the fully developed pressure gradient 
line at the downstream.  
For single-phase flow through the contraction, Chisholm 
(1983) combined the static pressure drop to the vena 
contracta and the pressure recovery downstream of the vena 
contracta to give the total static pressure drop at the 
contraction (∆Pc):

Two-phase pressure change across sudden contraction 
Geiger (1964) measured pressure drops for steam-water 
mixtures flowing through sudden contraction with area 
ratios (σA) of 0.398, 0.253, and 0.144. His test conditions 
are summarized in Table 1. The data were compared with 
the homogeneous model, momentum equation and 
mechanical energy equation across the contractions. The 
homogeneous model gave the best predictions of the data. 
McGee (1966) had also measured the steam-water mixtures 
flowing through sudden contraction using the same test rig 
as Geiger (1964), but with different test sections and 
conditions (σA = 0.608, 0.546). His test conditions are also 
listed in Table 1. The predictions by homogeneous model 
against the test data are quite satisfactory. The predictions 
by the momentum and mechanical energy equations were 
much lower than the test data. This deviation is believed due 
to the assumption of no mechanical energy loss for the 
acceleration of the fluids at the downstream of the 
contraction.  
For two-phase flow, the frictional pressure drop due to 
contraction can be estimated using a homogeneous flow 
model as recommended by Collier and Thome (1994):

        (6) 
The mass flux G is calculated based on the cross sectional 
area of the outlet tube with smaller cross sectional area. 
Chisholm (1983) also used his contraction loss coefficient 
K, Eq. (5), in association with the homogeneous model, i.e.,

Furthermore, Chisholm (1983) introduced a constant B

the contraction loss:

where ∆PcL is the contraction pressure drop for total flow 
assumed liquid across the same sudden contraction as  
Based on the momentum and mass transfer balance, 
Schmidt and Friedel (1997) developed a new pressure drop 
model for sudden contraction which incorporates all of the 
relevant boundary conditions. In this model all the relevant 
physical parameters were also included in their sudden 
expansion paper (1996).  
Recently, Abdelall et al. (2005) investigated air-water 
pressure drops caused by abrupt flow area expansion and 
contraction in a very small test section. The larger and small 
tube diameters were 1.6 and 0.84 mm, respectively. Their 
test conditions are listed in Table 1. The two-phase flow 
pressure change across the sudden contraction data was 
found significantly lower than the predictions of the 
homogeneous model. It may be attributed to the significant 
velocity slip at the vicinity of the flow area change.  
From the foregoing review of the two-phase pressure 
change across the sudden contraction, most of the 
investigations are related to the abrupt area change for the 
upstream and downstream having round tube configuration 
and the tube size are generally above 10 mm. However, it 
should be mentioned that configuration variation across 
singularity (e.g., from rectangular to round) is very common 
in practice. Hence the first objective of this study is to 
provide newly test data regarding to this influence. Further, 
it will be shown in subsequent comparisons that most of the 
proposed correlations/model is only applicable to their own 
database. In addition, flow visualization experiment is also 
carried out to link with certain special pressure drop 
phenomenon. In summary of the above objectives, the effort 
mass quality region (x < 0.1). This phenomenon was also 
observed by Schmidt and Friedel (1997) for their air-water 
data at G = 1000 kg/m2s, where a local peak of pressure 
drop vs. vapor quality is seen at a low mass flow quality. 
This phenomenon was characterized as a change of flow 
pattern in the inlet pipe or outlet pipe. In this study, we also 
find out a notable pressure drop is seen for G = 100 kg/m2s 
and a gas quality of 0.05 as appeared in Figs. 3 and 4. As 
delineated by Collier and Thome (1994), the presence of 
vena contracta effectively converted the accelerated and 
pressure energy into kinetic energy with little or no 
frictional dissipation from upstream. This will certainly 
offset the irreversible pressure loss caused by the 
singularity. Beyond the vena contracta position, the 
conditions are similar to those of sudden enlargement 
through which considerable frictional dissipation occurs. In 
essence, the considerable deflection of the contraction 
pressure drop is associated with the transition of forming the 
vena contracta. For a larger mass flux like G = 300 kg/m 
m2s, the vena contracta is still seen even at a very low 
quality range of 0.001 ~ 0.005. However, the rising 
frictional contribution with mass flux will counteract the 
occurrence of vena contracta, thereby leading to a 
comparatively small influence of vena contracta on the 
pressure drop.

To test the validity of the foregoing described 
models/correlations from the existing literatures, the 
measured two-phase pressure drop data subject to abrupt 
contraction in two test sections are compared with the 
previously described Homogeneous model, and correlations 
of Chisholm (1983), Schmidt and Friedel (1997)  and 
Abdelall et al (2005). All the models/correlations give fair 
predictions of the present data, but none of them can 
accurately predict the entire database. The average mean 
deviations of the relevant predictions are 49.15%, 50.8%, 
64.5%, 74.8% by Homogeneous model, Chisholm 
correlation, Friedel correlation, and Abdelall et al. 
correlation, respectively. The homogeneous model gives 
better predictive ability than the others which had also been 
indicated by Geiger (1964) and McGee (1966). For 
homogeneous predictions, the data with higher pressure 
drop give a good agreement with the predictions. Note that 
the flow patterns for these data with good predictions are 
actually annular flow. However, the data for all slug and 
stratified flows, where buoyancy force plays a significant 
role, are greatly over the predictions.

Figure. 5. Comparison between all available data and 
predictions of homogeneous model. 
There are some pressure drop data for two-phase flow 
across sudden contractions available from the literature as 
shown in Table 1. For comparison purpose, the present data 
and the available data from these literatures are compared 
with the predictions by the homogeneous model as shown in 
Figure 5. In general, the homogeneous predictions give a 
very good agreement with the two data sets reported by 
Geiger8 and Megeff10 with corresponding mean deviations 
of 19.93% and 16.81%, respectively. The mean deviations 
for the data of Schmidt and Friedel5 and the present data are 
43.46% and 49.15%, respectively. Nevertheless, the 
homogeneous model significantly over predicted the data of 
Abdelall et al.3 with 468.79% mean deviation which was 
also previously reported by themselves3. The possible cause 
for this large deviation is associated with the micro-tubes 
(with one inner diameter of 1.60 mm and the other of 0.84 
mm) being tested. For these micro tubes, influence caused 
by surface tension takes control. For obtaining a better 
predictive ability, one should also take into account the
