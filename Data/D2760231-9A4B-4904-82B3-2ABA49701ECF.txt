一、中文摘要
近年來，P2P 技術已經漸漸地受到學術
界與業界的重視，因此有越來越多的學者投
入這方面的研究。目前已經有 CAN、Pastry、
Chord、Tapstry 等許多 P2P 系統被提出來。
然而，這類型的系統只能提供簡單的查詢。
因此，有另一種類型的 P2P 系統被提出來，
這類型的系統被稱之為 PDMS (Peer Data
Management System)。PDMS 主要是利用
metadata 來對資源進行描述，不但使得對資
源的描述變得更有彈性，也能支援複雜的查
詢。不過大部分的 PDMS 依然是使用關鍵字
進行查詢，只有少部分的 PDMS 是使用 RDF
進行查詢。因此，本論文提出了一個建構於
ML-Chord 架構下的分散式 RDF 儲存庫。主
要作法是將節點依照本身所擁有的資源加入
到適當的資源層中，查詢時只需要在適當的
資源層當中進行搜尋，進一步提升了搜尋速
度並降低了搜尋成本。

Abstract
In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) computing
has attracted much attention in both research
and industrial communities. Many P2P systems
have been proposed such as CAN, Pastry,
Chord, Tapstry, etc., but they can only support
exact-match lookups. There is a new arena of
P2P research, called peer data management
system (PDMS), they use metadata which
provide great flexibility for annotating
resources to describe the shared resources and
can support complex queries. However, most of
them use the keywords to locate the
corresponding resources, and only a few of
them can support RDF queries to retrieve the
RDF documents that describe the requested
resources. In this thesis, we propose a
distributed RDF repository called RDF-Chord.
In RDF-Chord, nodes are assigned into the
appropriate ring sets based on the shared
resources and a query is forward only to a
subset nodes that stores the indexes of the
requested resources by using the appropriate
ring sets. Via detailed simulations, we show
that our approach is highly scalable and can
resolve RDF queries efficiently.
Keywords: Semantic-based P2P Systems, RDF,
Peer-to-Peer networks.
Since the wide spread usage of Napster and
KazAa, people started to realize the power of
resource sharing in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
manner. A P2P system is composed of a large
number of nodes. The nodes in the P2P system
called peers which can exchange data and
services in a decentralized and distributed
manner.
So far, many P2P systems have been
proposed. These P2P systems were classified
into three categories: centralized, decentralized
and unstructured, as well as decentralized and
structured. Napster, a well-known centralized
P2P system, requires a centralized directory
server to facilitate the file search. Hence, it is in
general not scalable and has the single point of
failure problem. For decentralized and
unstructured P2P systems such as Gnutella,
messages are flooded throughout the entire
network to locate requested resources.
Although they support multi-attribute queries
but they generate a large volume of query
traffic with no guarantee to find the desired
resources even if it exists. There are many
3predicate, find the subjects
and predicates of matched
triples
Q3 (?s, pi, ?o) logN given predicate pi, find the
subjects and objects of the
triples having this predicate
Q4 (?s, pi, oi) logN given object oi of predicate
pi, find the subjects of
matched triples
Q5 (si, ?p, ?o) logN given subject si, find all
predicates and objects of
the resource identified by si
Q6 (si, ?p, oi) logN given subject si, find its
predicate which has object
oi
Q7 (si, pi, ?o) logN given subject si, find its
object of predicate pi
Q8 (si, pi, oi) logN return this triple if it exists
otherwise return nothing
From the result of previous study
[11], it was shown that assigns nodes into
appropriate categories can reduce search space
and provide faster queries. In addition, less
maintenance traffic can be expected because
fewer nodes are assigned to each category layer.
According to the aforementioned advantages,
we design an appropriate ring sets based on the
different component of a triple that can resolve
the query efficiently by reducing the search
space. In this thesis, we propose a distributed
RDF repository called RDF-Chord. In
RDF-Chord, nodes are assigned into the
appropriate ring sets based on the shard
resources whose hash value of subject,
predicate and object respectively. A ring set is
consisted of multi-rings and each ring is
corresponding to a range of hash space. Nodes
are organized in a Chord-like manner on each
ring. By using the appropriate ring sets, fewer
nodes will be involved for answering queries.
RDFPeers defines eight possible atomic
triple queries which are summarized in Table I.
Based on these atomic queries, RDFPeers also
supports disjunctive and range queries as well
as conjunctive multi-predicate queries. Since it
is required to find all triples for Q8 queries, the
query cost of Q8 is O(N) where N is the number
of all nodes.
Although RDFPeers is efficient and scalable,
it has a few major drawbacks. RDFPeers is a
fully distributed PDMS. However, in reality,
only a small portion of nodes (called seeds in
BitTorrent clients) actually provides resources.
If only these nodes constitute a PDMS, the
queries will be faster and the maintenance cost
is lower because the search space is smaller.
Additionally, RDFPeers does not take full
advantages of metadata in range queries. For
example, a node wishes to find products whose
price falls within 100 and 500 and issues a
range query, <?s, price, ?o> AND 100  ?o
&& ?o500. In RDFPeers, the search space of
the query includes not only price that falls
within 100 and 500, but also all other
predicates (?p) that falls within 100 and 500. A
better approach is only to lookup the price that
falls within 100 and 500.
In this paper, we propose a flexible PDMS for
P2P networks called RDF-Chord. RDF-Chord
can be either fully distributed (if every node
has at least one shared resource) or hybrid (if
only partial nodes have resources to share). In
RDF-Chord, a set of keys is ingeniously
designed so that the advantages of metadata can
be further utilized. Shared resources and nodes
are assigned into the appropriate ring sets based
on the keys. A ring set contains multiple rings
and each ring is organized in a Chord-like ring.
From various experimental results, it can be
concluded that RDF-Chord is far superior than
RDFPeers.
