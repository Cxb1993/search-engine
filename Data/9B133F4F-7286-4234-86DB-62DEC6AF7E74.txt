內其他資通訊系統整合，仍以導航功能為其主要產品特色，近年來也
逐步整合車用娛樂等功能，由於可攜式導航裝置在價格上較 END 具
有優勢，且可在不同車輛間拆卸使用，對於擁有兩台車以上的消費者
有其使用上的便利性，因此讓許多中古或平價車款的車主亦可享受到
高級車款的服務裝置，所以受到許多消費者青睞。而具備 GPS 功能
的智慧型手機，使得消費者在行車時為車用導航機，在行走時為個人
導航機，再加上手機在服務功能及使用者習慣上，擁有較高的擴充彈

找出台灣消費者對於車用導航產品服務及功能的需求，針對現行台灣
各種車用導航產品所提供的服務與功能與台灣消費者需求的落差，找

壹、 研究目的 
GPS 是由美國政府所發展，整個系統約分成太空衛星、地面管
制站及使用者接收機等三大部份，其應用環境相當廣泛，故使用者接
收機 (泛稱為導航機)產品種類也相當的多樣化，依用途可分為車
用、航空用及航海用等各種不同用途的導航系統，而車用 GPS 目前
已廣泛應用在嵌入式導航裝置、可攜式產品、通訊產品及 3C 產品等
各種通訊裝置平台上(Pace, 1996; Pace & Wilson, 1998; Zheng & Ni, 
2006)。GPS 的基本應用就是導航與定位，定位的基本原理為計算太
空衛星與導航機間的距離，並依三角向量關係列出一個相關的方程
式，以計算出所在位置的座標資料，此資料在 GPS 裏稱為一個航點 
(Waypoint)。而導航就是利用所求出的定位資料來計算，由於在地球
表面上的任何位置，都可用座標值來表達，因此只要知道兩個不同航
點的座標資料，就可計算兩航點間的直線距離、相對方位及航行速
度，這就是導航機導航資料的來源，故要利用 GPS 做導航功能，最
基本的就是先建立航點的資料，然後儲存在導航機內，以供日後辨識
計算使用(Pace, 1996; Pace & Wilson, 1998；Theiss et al., 2005)。現今
車用導航系統包括兩部分：全球定位系統和自動導航系統。就硬體而
言，導航裝置可分為 GPS 晶片模組，無線傳輸模組、應用處理器模
組及螢幕等；就軟體而言，核心關鍵是電子地圖、導航軟體，導航所
需的道路資訊都來自電子地圖，地圖資料的質量，諸如精確度、覆蓋

參、 相關議題探討之文獻 
自從美國政府 1995 政策性開放 GPS 系統免費予民間使用，使得
與 GPS 系統應用有關的產品及技術，不斷的蓬勃發展及進步(Lechner, 
2000)，從產品端及消費者端的觀察來看，新技術藉由產品與終端消
費市場的互動，逐步改進以符合市場需求，而技術成熟後，產品終究
會達生產的經濟規模，促使生產成本下降，並調降產品價格回饋消費
者或者在既有產品上附加新功能或服務，以維持或增加消費者的滿意
度，這樣的需求互動及利潤回饋或加值的過程，不僅會改變消費者的
使用習慣及選購意願，更會影響產業結構與獲利模式。本章節共分三
大部份：第一部份著重在車用導航技術及市場概況；第二部份為市場
定位概念的探討；第三部份則是車用導航服務構面的探討。 
 
3.1 車用導航技術及市場概況 
 
GPS 科技的發展，改變了消費者對於導航服務的需求與行為模
式，藉由電子導航，駕駛車輛到目的地，已不必按圖索驥尋找地點，
而無線科技的興起，更造就車用導航即時資訊相關服務及其它加值應
用的興起，以下就導航科技的演進、GPS 系統運作方式、GPS 技術
的應用領域及範圍、車用導航市場發展概況等作介紹。導航科技的演
進為人們藉由閱讀的行為，控制載具(車、船及飛機等)，方便人們從
一地移動到另一地，所有導航的技巧及技術，皆需利用相較已知的地

一致。衛星定位訊號的發送時間與使用者接愛器的時間差乘以光速，
可得 GPS 接受器與 GPS 衛星之間的距離，GPS 接受器藉由偵測、解

衛星所發出的 GPS 訊號，如：個人導航裝置(如：手機、車用導航機
等)、飛機及武器等(Pace, 1996; Pace & Wilson, 1998; Zheng & Ni, 
2006)。

GPS 系統的運作方式，如圖 3-1 所示，GPS 運作的基本概念是
量測 GPS 接受器與 GPS 衛星之間的距離(或範圍)，即衛星定位訊號
的發送時間與使用者接愛器的時間差乘以電波傳送速度(光速)，簡單
來說，24 個 GPS 衛星其在太空軌道的特定位置為已知值，而 GPS 接
受器在地球表面上的位置為未知值，經由比對 GPS 衛星時鐘與 GPS
接收機內的時鐘，計算衛星定位訊號傳送所花的時間差，再將此時間
差乘光速，可得 GPS 衛星與 GPS 接收機間的距離，如此就可依三角

及武器系統仍能發揮最大的整合功效及攻擊手，並精確的命中目標，
而 GPS 被視為盟軍能夠獲勝的關鍵因素之一，從此 GPS 便廣泛應用
於各種軍事行動、武器系統及高精度的衛星軌道定位用途(Lechner & 
Baumann, 2000; Theiss et al., 2005)。 
 
在民生消費用途方面：GPS 系統在日常生活中的應用隨處可
見，並散見於各領域，如：導航、環境保護、農林漁牧礦業、交通運
輸、健康及居家照護、法律及公權力執行、社會安全、航海及水文、
資源探勘及工程建設、基礎設施的建構及管理、天氣預測及公共安全
等(Theiss et al., 2005)。在導航用途方面：目前事故地點通知及道路援
救、失竊協尋及拖吊通知、路線規劃及指引、即時交通資訊，已普遍
為大眾接受與使用。導航再加上追蹤功能，可使警消救難人員在第一
時間確定事發地點，並調度及動員車輛、飛機或船艦與專業人員做災
難的處理，以發揮最佳救援時機及效率(Chen & Stauss, 1997; Liu et al., 
2005; Sadoun & Bayari, 2007; Acierno et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009)。在
農林漁牧礦業及資源探勘方面；GPS 廣泛應用於農機導航、礦油資源
探勘、自動駕駛、漁牧追蹤定位 (Higitt & Warburton, 1999; Peyret et al., 
2000; Ruff & Holden, 2003; Sikanen et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; 
Dell'Ariccia et al., 2008)。在工程施工及建設方面：GPS 應用於戶外量
測，可節省大量的人力及成本，且效率提升(Amore et al., 2002; Li et al., 
2005)。在社會安全及公共安全的應用方面：如預防兒童老人及特殊
人群的走失、健康及居家照護、限制住居或行動人員監視、地殼板塊
運動及地震預防等(Loevenbruck et al., 2001; Tsiknakis et al., 2002; 
Nunn, 2001; Weyerer et al., 2005; Angelier et al., 2009)。 
 
自從美國政府 1995 政策性開放 GSP 系統予民間使用，使得與
GPS 系統應用有關的產品及技術，不斷的蓬勃發展及進步，有關車用
導航的應用最初首見於高級車輀的所使用的 END 中(Nam et al., 
2005)，除了導航功能外，亦提供其它如人車安全及人車保全及行動
通訊與服務的功能，單價頗為昂貴，且大多裝載於特定車廠的高價車
款，但隨著車用導航的需求殷切，產業因應潮流所需推出可攜式導航
機 (PND)，較 END 更具有成本較低及簡易快速更新地圖資訊的優
勢。而美國 E911 法案規定在 2005 年底前，美國境內民眾所使用的手
機須具備基本的 GPS 定位功能，使民眾在使用手機撥打 911 電話求
時，能追蹤顯示使用者的位置，以便急難救助與處理，而後來許多先
進國家，亦推行相關類似的法令，如：歐盟 E112、日本的 E110/119
法案(Lechner, 2000; Sadoun & Bayari, 2007)，由於政府政策的要求，
無形中促成 GPS 手機的需求，故引發近來年 GPS 手的爆炸性成長。
10 
 
美市場是較低。 
 
從上述國外服務或內容設計的發展歷程來看，歐美的廠商對於
END，除了基本的導航功能外，更偏重在安全與保全服務，而日本的
車載資通訊系統則是以導航與地圖服務起家，近年來則逐步強化其溝
通與資訊服務、影音娛樂服務方面的功能。而台灣的 END 則是採開
放系統，在融合的日本的導航技術之後也逐漸開始重視當地的使用者
需求。因應台灣車輛失竊率高與違規拖吊頻繁，服務內容整合供應商
也在安全與保全服務方面找到當地使用者的需求。有鑒於區域市場特
性的差異，使用者的需求亦會隨著所處環境的不同而有所差異，因此
一個適合使用者的 END 勢必整合現有的資訊技術、通訊技術與車輛
技術，才能讓汽車由封閉的機械系統轉變為開放的行動服務系統，讓
汽車除了原本核心運輸價值之外，增添了導航、安全、保全、資訊、
通訊、娛樂等附加價值，讓駕駛與乘客可以透過車載資通訊系統與支
援中心 (Call center)聯絡，取得所需的資訊與通訊服務，一方面提高
車輛使用便利性，另一方面也確保在適度的監控下，車輛的操控上能
夠更加安全。雖然目前車載資通訊系統硬體雖然面臨價格較高的問
題，隨著資通訊的科技創新以及系統服務走向普及化，有助於廠商的
裝置生產與服務提供能夠早一步達到經濟規模，屆時 END 將會成為
車輛的基本配備。現今 END 的產業價值鏈(如圖 3-2 所示)，車廠及服
務內容整合供應商扮演關鍵的角色，車廠主導汽車的規格及標準出廠
的基本配備，而服務內容整合供應商扮演系統整合的關鍵角色，透過
電信網路提供使用者各式各樣的服務。 
 
(2) PND 市場發展概況 
 
人們對於車用導航的需求已經被 END 引爆，而 PND 憑著其價
格上的優勢，迅速的進入車用導航商品市場，而隨著無線通訊寬頻技
術的成熟及進步，亦改變了 PND 產業價值鏈(如圖 3-2 所示)的生態，
無線科技為 PND 所帶來的主要衝擊，為使 PND 從一封閉的系統，轉
換成開放式的系統，從前電子地圖資料庫及導航資訊或軟體為在購買
時預先燒錄至 PND，若需更新電子地圖資料及導航資訊或軟體，則
需購買更新光碟或透過個人電腦自網路下載資料完成更新。 
 
現今 PND 藉由無線科技的協助，除了可即時傳輸、下載並更新
相關電子地圖資訊及軟體，同時更可提供其它與即時性或動態性有關
的加值服務，如：路況、天氣、油價、救援服務、停車場空位、休閒
遊憩地點及商家資訊等服務(Chen & Stauss, 1997; Liu et al., 2005; 
12 
 
備，以刺激消費者的需求。而以技術整合的觀點來看，手機只需在原
有晶片組中，加入 GPS 模組，即可具備 GPS 功能，而隨著技術的進
步，現行市場主流多朝向 SoC 方案發展，此舉不但可節省製造成本，
亦可節省手機的耗電量。

2-4 為 2007~2010 全球各類車用 GPS 產品銷售量，依圖 3-3 及圖 3-4
所示，在 END 產品方面：全球 Telematics 市場規模逐年成長，但年
成長率趨緩， END 的發展雖然最早亦最久，裝載比例仍屬偏低，但
隨著消費者使用習慣的養成、車廠將 END 列為新車標準配備、服務
內容整合供應商各項加值服務的提供及政府政策支持或要求的推動
下，END 市場仍保持穩定的成長，但成長幅度不大，分析原因有四：
一為 Telematics 系統的建立，尚需政府法規政策、基礎軟硬體設施、
車廠及服務內容整合供應商業者的配合等諸多因素，才能將技術及產
品建構完成，並提供完整的 Telematics 服務，這需要長時間的建構及
發展，故市場呈現穩定的成長；二為 END 的價格昂貴且只裝載特定
高級車款中；三為完成車廠車用電子的認證需要 2~3 年的時間，拉長
商品上市時間；四為近年來售價較低廉的 PND 及 GPS 手機瓜分車用
導航市場的大餅，此舉勢必會影響到 END 的銷售量，END 勢必要有
差異化的服務及功能，如：著重在車用安全的發展，方能繼續獲得車
主及消費者青睞。 
在 PND 產品方面：雖然市場規模仍逐年成長，但年成長率卻呈
現趨緩下降的情況，最主要係因全球經濟不景氣的影響，汽車銷售量
的下跌，進而影響到 PND 的銷售量，而在不景氣的年代，消費者可
能轉而購買兼具導航功能及手機功能的 GPS 手機，亦間接造成 PND
的需求量下降。而全球 PND 的產值預估，銷售量雖仍有成長，但因
隨著技術成熟及製造成本的下降，使得 PND 產品平均單價下降所
致，導致 PND 產業總體產值下跌，未來 PND 產業的產值要向上提升，
只能依靠售後加值服務市場的收入。而未來全球 PND 各區域出貨量
比例的預估，亞太市場應為成長最迅速的地區，起因為中國大陸等新
興國家，隨著經濟成長，交通建設大增，國民所得提高，能負擔得汽
車的消費者大增，進而帶動 PND 的需求成長，而 PND 硬體單價的逐
年下跌，亦對刺激消費者購買，有一定的助益。 
在 GPS 手機方面：在各國政府政策支持、手機業者紛紛將 GPS

3.2 市場定位概念探討 
Porter (1985)指出企業價值鏈(value chain)為將企業的經營活動
分割成一系列投入至產出的連續流程，流程中每個階段的活動，都對
最終產品的價值有所貢獻，企業依賴這此活動附加價值的增加
(value-added)，藉由交易與外部環境資源互換。而 Porter 亦認為產品
的競爭優勢來自於廠商許多的價值活動，每個活動都有助於提升相對
的成本地位，並創造差異化的基礎，而關鍵活動能創造最高的附加價
值。故對於顧客而言，企業創造差異化於其產品的手段，可為增加價
值或降低價格，而企業能夠生存及獲利的理由，在於使顧客進行購買
時同時滿足其需求，故了解顧客的需求，進而生產符合顧客需求的產
品，為企業能持續經營及獲利的關鍵。本研究擬藉由建構車用導航服
務構面的價值體系，來評估消費者對於各項車用導航服務價值或價格
準則的需求及滿意程度，企業可依此來了解顧客重視的準則，以開發
符合顧客需求的產品。 
 
CroninJr. et al. (2000)在評估有關服務品質、服務價值及顧客滿意
16 
 
消費者是無法把所的成本及效益指標都與以貨幣化，對於消費者而
言，決定是否購買取決於該產品是能夠滿足其需求與該產品的價格與
價值組合是否能夠達到其渴望水準，此外大部份的消費者在進行評選
決策時，並非只追求功能或價值的不斷擴充，相對的他們也會去考慮
到產品或服務的成本或定價，因此他們在進行決策時會在產品價值與
價格間作取捨，所以一個廠商的價值創造是應該要兼顧產品的價值與
價格，因此只有不斷提升價格與價值滿意度，才能真正使得顧客滿意。 
 
D’Aveni (2007)與 Lin et al. (2008)的研究都點出了價格與效益價
值間的抵換關係，然而 D’Aveni (2007)採用回歸分析來處理價格與效
益間的抵換問題，其優勢在於可以直接處理許多現存並容易取得價格
的產品，不過該方法很難處理多元效益的評價問題，因此必須分別求
取個別效益與價格的抵換關係，Lin et al. (2008)採用的價值與價格滿
意度的衡量指標並透過多評準決策模式的方法來處理多元效益的問
題，該方法可以一次處理(多個)有形效益與無形效益，同時可以處理
不同屬性的偏好問題，因此本研究採用了 Lin et al. (2008)所提出的模
式，並據以建構車用導航裝置的市場定位模式。 
 
3.3 車用導航服務構面探討 
早在十多年前，歐洲學者在研究先進交通資通訊系統 (Advanced 
Transport Telematics, ATT)時，運用動態模擬方式以解決各項交通問
題，即指出公共建設的效率及安全性，為歐洲經濟與社會凝聚不可或
缺的必要條件，同時亦反應出當時歐洲社會對於利用資通訊技術進行
道路導航，以因應交通狀況，改善堵塞問題是的迫切性。也希望在不
久的將來，隨著科技的進步，即時的資訊更新，能夠動態反應交通狀
況(Chen & Stauss, 1997)。現今與交通有關的車用導航與地圖服務，交
通狀況資訊已可提供即時更新來服務用路人，而與行車安全、保全有
關的車載資通訊服務，如行車安全與救援服務，都將使人們在行的方
面更加便利及安全。依據原國際電報電信委員會 (International 
Consultative Committee for Telephone and Telegraph, ICCTT)對於資通
訊服務的定義為：資通訊服務能提供電信網絡的使用者。不同以往以
電話或電報方式所提供的相關服務，它能幫助大眾或個人的資訊傳遞
與接收，包含檔案傳輸、商業或金融交易等，如：視訊會議、電子郵
件、電傳視訊、傳真、行動電話等，都可算是資通訊服務的一環
(Adamopoulos et al., 1998)。 
 
而後續研究指出，資通訊科技的快速進步，如：網際網路、行
動電話及 PDA 等發展，將對人們未來的生活造成重大的影響，未來
18 
 
讓聲音、圖像和影像檔案得以自由存取的全球資訊標準)的功能，系
統會根據個人資訊(如：年紀、興趣等)，及透過行動裝置所傳送使用
者當時所處的環境資訊(如：地點、時間等)，來提供觀光客所需要的
資訊。舉例來說，喜歡買書消費者在經過一家書店時，GUIDE 系統
會主動發送電子書單型錄到手持裝置中，消費者可即時地決定可以買
什麼書及到什麼地點買書，系統能幫助消費者在移動中的當下，做出
兼顧效率及有效的決定，相較其它沒有使用此系統的人，能提升消費
者的滿意度。在最佳路線規劃方面：近期南韓研究者開發出一套 OYT
系統 (Optimize Your Time System)，系統內建首爾所有火車的時刻
表，消費者只要持有裝載 GPS 接收器的行動終端裝置，藉由 GPS 產
品傳送至系統伺服器使用者的情境資料(現在時間及所在地點座標資
訊)，系統即能自動為消費者規劃，自目前所在地所需路程最短及費
時最少的行進路線至指定的火車站(Kim et al., 2009)。另外有學者研究
指出，藉由情境認知計算技術的協助，業者能為每位消費者量身打
造，提供個人化的服務與需求(Economides & Grousopoulou, 2009; 
Reuver & Haaker, 2009)。除了上述購物資訊及最佳路線規劃外，情境
認知計算技術對於行車當中的食、住、行及娛樂等資訊，亦有其它廣
泛的應用(Theiss et al., 2005)，如：使用者在行車中查詢晚餐餐廳及價
位資訊，系統將自動列入方圓幾公里內的所有餐廳，再配合系統內建
的餐廳營業時間，將營業時間以外的餐飲店排除(如早餐店)，提供最
迎合使用者所需的資訊。在行動資訊與服務中，傳統的車用多媒體娛
樂，為一封閉型系統，人們必需針對自己喜好的多媒體儲存形式，選
擇不同的硬體設備播放，如：錄音帶、VCD、DVD 及 MP3 等，其傳
輸介面皆不同。雖然隨著科技的進步而有整合型的影音播放裝置的出
現，經由不同介面的整合，免除使用者系統轉換的困擾，但卻不易解
決流行性、即時性或喜好性等因人而異的需求。同樣拜資通訊科技之
賜，消費者已可透過行動裝置藉由無線網路，直接上網作影音、音樂
等各項多媒體資訊的即時蒐尋及下載，隨著情境，選擇自己最想要的
多媒體娛樂服務(Golob & Regan, 2001)。

學者在探討行動電話的訂價模式指出：較低的價格為維持既有

於不知如何使用，業者可藉由免費體驗或限時體驗方案，讓消費者熟
悉使用新功能或服務(Economides & Grousopoulou, 2009)。荷蘭學者在

4.1 市場定位評估模型建構 
本研究模式採用 Lin et al. (2008)提出的概念，思維是從大部份的
消費者在進行產品評選決策時，並非只追求功能或價值的不斷擴充，
相對會考慮到所支付的成本或價格，所以選購者的決策模式會是在價
值與價格間作取捨，所以一個廠商的價值創造是應該要兼顧產品的價
值與價格，因此只有不斷提升價格與價值滿意度，才能真正使得客戶
滿意。因此本研究就是基於這個想法建構出一個融合價格滿意度與價
值滿意度的決策圖，圖 4-1 呈現出一個決策者在面臨採購問題時所經
常發生的問題，但傳統的成本效益概念為不錯的思維，但在許多決策
情境下，一個採購者並無法將所有的成本以及效益項目都給予量化的
金錢指標，相對的他們往往只有一個滿意度的概念，而這也正是本研
究採用滿意度作為決策雙軸的原因。 
 
Lin et al. (2008)採用的價值與價格滿意度的衡量指標並透過多
評準決策模式的方法來處理多元效益的問題，該方法可以一次處理
(多個)有形效益與無形效益，同時可以處理不同屬性的偏好問題，因
此本研究採用了 Lin et al. (2008)所提出的模式概念圖，透過圖 8 的分
析模式找出車用導航系統的產品發展策略圖。圖 4-1 中橫軸代表著客
戶藉由產品或服務的各個面向所構成的價值滿意度，以本研究所討論
的案例就是以導航與行動服務、資訊與系統服務與產品形象與客戶關

面向所構成的價格滿意度，以本研究所討論的案例就是以費率與付款
方式構面所形成，而由價值滿意度(V)與價格滿意度(P)構成了選購者
的決策空間，在 VSI 與 PSI 獨立成立的前提下，圖 4-1 中的 45 度線
代表著不同滿意程度的客戶滿意度線，當客戶滿意度線往右上方移代
表客戶滿意度提高，相對的客戶滿意度線往左下移代表客戶滿意度降
低。而平面上的每個點代表一個產品點，當產品點往右上方移則代表
產品的滿意度增加，反之往左下移代表產品的滿意度下降，若產品點
在客戶滿意度線上平移則代表相同的滿意程度。圖中 10P V+ = 的線代
表消費者的滿意度基準，也就是說一單位的價值滿意度增加就會使一
單位的價格滿意度下降，因為這部份的價值增加來自於價格的增加，
也因此價格滿意度就會下降，而在 10P V+ = 的滿意度線上面最極端典

低廉，但現實上並不會存在這兩種產品點，比較多的產品點則是如圖

徵 ie 會影響到特徵 je ?」之類的問題，若答案為「是」則 1ijπ = ，若為
「否」則 0ijπ = 。關聯矩陣的一般形式可表示成如下面所示:

其中 I 為單位矩陣，k 表示冪次，M*為可能到達矩陣，注意在此的矩

4.3 準則權重關係建構—層級網路分析(ANP)模式 
層級分析法 (Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP)為美國匹茲堡大
學教授 Saaty 於 1980 年提出，是一種有效率的多準則評估方法，主
要將決策問題分解為垂直階層的關係，再透過量化的判斷進行評估。
但在使用層級分析法時有必須滿足的前提，譬如各階層準則其他層級
間必須為獨立關係。但現實生活中的問題常存在相依或是回饋的關
係，隨著問題與要素的增加，關係也愈加複雜，因此過於理想化的層
級分析法(AHP)便無法適合現實世界的問題，導致評估結果產生偏
差，因此才有後續 Saaty 在 1996 年所提出的網路層級分析法( Analytic 
Network Process, ANP)的觀念。Saaty 為了改善層級分析法過於理想的
缺點，於 1996 年提出 ANP 的觀念。網路層級分析模式可以處理問題
的相依性及回饋關係，使得此評估方法更能貼近實際問題的應用

4.4 方案偏好選擇模式建構—VIKOR 模式 
完成車用導航系統功能及服務評選準則之選取及準則權重的建
立後，即可進入另一個階段－替選方案績效評選。在實際的評估問題
中，評估準則間經常具有許多互相競爭(衝突)的情況，因而導致沒有
辦法找到一個能夠同時滿足所有準則的解。透過 MCDM，對於互相
競爭(衝突)的評估準則之間能夠產生妥協解，以協助決策者制訂最後
的決策。在車用導航系統評選準則中，車用導航系統的功能及服務愈
多，則該車用導航系統將愈昂貴，因此在需求面中的功能及服務準則
和成本準則是相互衝突的。由於評選準則之間存在著相互衝突的特
性，因此本研究乃採用 MCDM 中可以產生妥協解的 VIKOR 法
(Opricovic & Tzeng, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007; Tzeng et al., 2002a; Tzeng 
et al., 2002b; Tzeng et al., 2005)，對於各個車用導航系統方案之績效逕
行評估和排序。 
VIKOR 是由 Opricovic 所提出(Opricovic & Tzeng, 2002, 2003, 
2004, 2007; Tzeng et al., 2002a; Tzeng et al., 2002b; Tzeng et al., 
2005) ，是屬於多準則決策中最佳化妥協解方法 (Compromise 
programming)之一，其基本觀念乃在於先界定理想解 (最佳解，
Positive-ideal solution)與負理想解(最差解，Negative-ideal solution)，
所謂理想解是指各備選方案在各評估準則中之最佳者；而負理想解則
是各替選方案在各評估準則中之最差者。而後經由比較各備選方案的
評估值和理想方案的接近程度來排列方案之間的優先順序。在計算各
方案與理想方案的接近度時，必須將各評估準則的分數予以加總。在
加總的方法上，VIKOR 的加總方法乃是由折衷規劃法的 Lp-metric 發
展而成(Yu, 1973; Zeleny, 1982)，其特色為提供最大化之「群體效益」，
以及最小化的「反對意見的個別遺憾」，所以其妥協解可被決策者接
受。以一個兩評估準則的評選問題為例，VIKOR 的妥協解之概念可
以圖 4-2 表示。

上式中，v 為決策機制係數，v 大於 0.5 時表示根據大多數決議
的方式制訂決策，v 近似 0.5 表示根據贊同情況制訂決策，v 小於 0.5 
時表示根據拒絕的情況制訂決策。在 VIKOR 中乃將 v 設定為 0.5，
以同時追求群體效用最大化和個別遺憾最小化。min kk S 所得之值即是
群體最大效用(Majority rule)，而min kk R 所得之值即是最小個別遺憾。
kQ 的意義為 k 方案能產生的利益比率。 
 
(4)進行方案排序 
本研究進行方案排序的方式，系列用 v 值為 0.5 時的 kQ 值來建立
價值滿意度指標(VSI)與價格滿意度指標(PSI)，研究選出 v 值為 0.5
時的 kQ 值，以建立同時追求群體效用最大化和個別遺憾最小化的滿意
度指表，不過由於 kQ 值是屬於望小指標( kQ 值越小越好)，而其範圍在
0~1 之間，因此本研究將其轉成望大指標(1 kQ− 值越大越好)，因此當
價值滿意度的 v 值為 0.5 時 V 等於 kQ 值，其 VSI 指標為1 kQ− ，反之
當價格滿意度的 v 值為 0.5 時 kP Q= 值，其 PSI 指標為1 kQ− ，然後即
可得到不同方案的價值滿意度指標(VSI)與價格滿意度指標(PSI)。

(4)進行方案排序 
由表 5-22 與表 5-23，可以看出不同 v 情況下 kQ 值表，研究選出 v 值為
0.5 時的 kQ 值，以建立同時追求群體效用最大化和個別遺憾最小化的滿意度
指標，不過由於 kQ 值是屬於望小指標( kQ 值越小越好)，而其範圍在 0~1 之
間，因此本研究將其轉成望大指標(1 kQ− 值越大越好)，因此當價值滿意度的
v 值為 0.5 時 V 等於 kQ 值，其 VSI 指標為1 kQ− ，反之當價格滿意度的 v 值
為 0.5 時 kP Q= 值，其 PSI 指標為1 kQ− ，然後即可得到不同方案的價值滿意
度(VSI)與價格滿意度(PSI)指標，如表 5-22 所示，M 公司 L 產品在 v 值為
0.5 時的價值滿意度 kQ 值為 0.726，而其 VSI 值為 0.274，而 M 公司 L 產品
在 v 值為 0.5 時的價格滿意度 kQ 值為 0，而其 PSI 值為 1，研究將各方案的
VSI 與 PSI 指標以二維圖表示，如圖 5-6 所示，圖中的 45 度的斜直線代表
等效用線，也就是 VSI 與 PSI 值相加為定值，也就是在 45 度線上的總滿意
度(價值滿意度與價格滿意度)是相同的，越往右上其總滿意度越高，越往左

為最低，而總滿意度最高為 M 公司 L 產品 (0.274, 1.000)，其次是 G 公司 N

經由準則滿意度及重要度的分析，可看出使用者對於車用導航直接相
關的服務及系統功能：語音導航服務、行車狀況資訊、電子地圖資訊、介
面與軟硬體設計、資訊更新頻率、售後服務及服務費率等為滿意度高且重
要度高 ○ (+,+)，顯示對消費者而言，車用導航裝置最重要的價值仍在與「導
航」有關的功能，消費者重視於使用導航功能時，能得到最新及最正確的
資訊，並在最短的時間內到達目的地，故業者仍應在這些重要度高的項目
上持續的精進及改善，以維持高滿意度；而使用者認為行動資訊與服務、
平台整合服務、資訊安全防護、計價方式、付款方式、繳費通路、外形設
計、品牌形象及個人隱私保護為滿意度低且重要度低 [▼ (-,-)]，但仍為應
該被改善的項目，這些項目短期雖不至於影響評估系統滿意度，不過隨者
科技的進步，使得新服務及新功能不斷推陳出新，消費者將不再滿足於現
況所提供的功能或服務，將使上述準則重要度提高，並對系統滿意度造成
影響。 
 
在運用 ISM 所得之結構關聯分析中，研究發現導航與行動服務構面 
(NM)、資訊與系統服務構面 (IS)與品牌形象構面 (PI)構成一個雙向回饋的
系統，研究將其命名為價值滿意度系統，而由費率與付款方式構面 (FP)獨
立構成一個系統，將其命名為價格滿意度系統。而本研究運用網路層級法 
(ANP)得到各評估準則的相對權重，並經由 VIKOR 分析，可以看出目前台
灣車用導航裝置廠商的競爭策略可分為三種：G 公司是以提升價值滿意度
的高價值策略，而 M 公司是提高價格滿意度的低價格策略，而 Y 公司則是
兼顧價值滿意度與價格滿意度的平衡策略，而 A 公司在價格滿意度上呈現
劣勢，在價值滿意度上仍有差距，因此其改善策略應該加以明確，不過研
究建議其改善方向應該朝向距離最近的平衡模式，同時提高價值滿意度與
價格滿意度，其次才是提升價值滿意度的高價值策略與提高價格滿意度的
低價格策略。 
 
陸、 結論 
車用導航產品於近幾年快速興起，從過去高階市場的奢侈品變成大眾
市場上的必需品，而電子地圖服務的質量也在持續的快速進步當中，以求
達到消費者可接受的水準，故面對越見激烈的車用導航的市場競爭，業者
若僅侷限於硬體設備及電子地圖軟體的服務，已不足以滿足消費者的需
求，故不少台灣業者推出針對分眾市場所設計的特殊應用機種，如：運用
於自行車及重型機車騎士的專用導航機，強調其防水耐震防護功能，以及
抗 UV 高背光觸控螢幕，讓騎士在太陽光下也能輕易讀取資料，或是整合
多媒體娛樂功能的複合機型，如：整合數位電視娛樂及衛星導航雙功能產
品。本研究試圖將客戶滿意度的概念導入產品發展中，並建立一套整合價
值滿意度與價格滿意度的產品評選模式，試圖找出產品的市場定位並進一
46 
 
全面搭配觸控螢幕的搭載，以方便文字輸入，尚需一段時間、螢幕大小要
在 3 吋以上，以方便觀看地圖資訊、手機處理器夠強大，能同時處理及運
算大量電子地圖資訊、聲音及日益增加的功能服務，以上問題勢必將隨時
間而獲得解決。但 PND 由於功能及服務擴充有限，不及手機來得多樣及有
彈性，而消費者亦沒有必要改變使用習慣，將 PND 脫離車子行進間使用，
而應用於一般日常生活中， PND 將來應走向 M 型化發展，其一為發展純
導航用途的低價 PND，以價格取勝 GPS 手機，供經常開車者用途單純的車
輛導航；其二為持續發展高精度之 PND，如：魚群探測、精密量測、航空
及礦脈探勘等專業級應用，方可與手機 GPS 做市場區隔。不過本研究目前
僅對少量產品進行實證，希望後續研究可以增加更多類型產品實證，並進
一步找出同一廠商的不同時期的產品發展策略，以及針對不同種消費者屬
性進行更深入的研究。

FMCDM with Fuzzy DEMATEL Approach for Customers’ Choice  
Behavior Model 
 
Hsu Chen-Yi, Chen Ke-Ting, and Tzeng Gwo-Hshiung 
 
Abstract1
At present, there are many factors affecting 
customer’s choice when they decide on what to buy 
in a fuzzy environment. In the current customer’s 
market, everyone wants things that are affordable 
but of high quality. Taking this into consideration, it 
becomes very important for each business to make a 
competent marketing strategic decision. They must 
be aware of the customer’s thoughts to expand their 
market share and outdo their competitors. Clearly, 
the market still has a lot of factors to consider. 
Therefore, the critical issue is to identify with the 
customer’s thoughts and construct a Customer’s 
Choice Behavior Model (CCBM) for solving this 
problem of Customer’s Choice. In this paper, a 
framework that considers customer’s choice behav-
ior, applies the graph-theory-based fuzzy Decision 
Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy 
DEMATEL) approach combined with Fuzzy Multi-
ple Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) is proposed. 
First, fuzzy DEMATEL is used to find the key fac-
tors and attributes in building the structure rela-
tions of an ideal Customer’s Choice Behavior. Then, 
FMCDM is demonstrated to evaluate whether the 
firm’s performance and customer’s satisfaction have 
differences or not. Empirical studies of Lexus and 
BMW are illustrated to show how well Lexus’ sales 
is doing, whether or not they had satisfied Custom-
ers’ needs, and determine the magnitude of the gap 
between them in order to correct this with the right 
strategy. 
 
Keywords: Customer’s market, Customers’ Choice 
Behavior Model (CCBM), graph theory, Fuzzy DE-
MATEL, Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making 
(FMCDM). 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The environment becomes more complicated, so 
effective decision-making is more desired. In our life,

we have to meet the complex and confusing situation 
everyday, thus making decisions are hard. We try to 
identify the causal or complex relationships of a prob-
lem, in order to make the appropriate solution when 
customers choosing or buying. The Decision Making 
Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method 
is presented in 1973 [11-14], [38], as a kind of struc-
tural modeling approach about a problem. It can clear 
see the cause-effect relationship of criteria when meas-
uring a problem. Although this DEMATEL method is a 
good technique for evaluating problems and making 
decisions, we decide the relationships of systems are 
usually given by crisp values in establishing a structural 
model [9], [18], [20], [35]. However, in this real world, 
crisp values are inadequate to as clinical standard. 
Many evaluation criteria are surely imperfect [40-43]. 
They are probably uncertain factors, with the result that, 
these criteria cannot measure by crisp value [40-43]. 
Thus, we apply the concept of Fuzzy theory [40-43] to 
the DEMATEL method for solving multi-criteria deci-
sion-making problems. We propose the utilization of 
the fundamental principles encompassed in the fuzzy 
set theory to analyze and consider a multiplicity of 
complex criteria and determine the most suitable crite-
ria in marketing strategic planning. The fundamental 
emphasis of the current Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Deci-
sion-Making (FMCDM) methodology [3], [6] is the 
determination, definition, testing and comparison of 
complex multi-level criteria used in the criteria selec-
tion process. 
With this in mind, we provide a framework which 
considers both factors and applies the graph theory 
based on Fuzzy DEMATEL method combined with 
FMCDM approach; accurately aiming for a more useful 
way to solve customers purchasing-decision problems 
of automobile. Empirical studies of automobile modes 
(Lexus and BMW) in Taiwan are illustrated as our test 
case to demonstrate the proposed framework with re-
gard to its usefulness and validity.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we will discuss the Customers’ Choice Be-
havior Model (CCBM) of automobile. The methodol-
ogy includes the Fuzzy DEMATEL with FMCDM ap-
proach of fuzzy environment is derived in Section 3. 
Empirical studies are presented to illustrate the proce-
dure of the proposed method and to demonstrate its 
usefulness and validity in Section 4. Finally, based on

STEP 1: Defining the evaluation criteria and design 
the fuzzy linguistic scale 
It is necessary to establish sets of criteria for 
evaluation. However, evaluation criteria have the nature 
of causal relationships and usually comprise many 
complicated aspects. To gain a structural model divid-
ing involved criteria into cause and effect groups, the 
Fuzzy DEMATEL method is an appropriate technique. 
To deal with the ambiguities of human assessments, the 
research discard the comparison scale used in crisp 
DEMATEL method but adopt the fuzzy linguistic scale 
used in the group decision-making proposed by Li [19]. 
 
Table 3.1: The correspondence of linguistic terms and lin-
guistic values (example) 
Linguistic terms Linguistic values 
No influence (N): 1 (0, 0, 0.25) 
Low influence (L): 2 (0, 0.25, 0.5) 
High influence (H): 3 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) 
Strongly influence (S): 4 (0.5, 0.75, 1.0) 
 
That is the different degrees of “influence” are 
expressed with five linguistic terms as “Strong”, “High”, 
“Low”, “No” and their corresponding positive triangu-
lar fuzzy numbers are shown in Table 1. 
 
STEP 2: Establishing the directed-relation matrix 
To measure the relationship between crite-
ria { 1,2,...,iC C i n= = } , a decision group of p experts 
were asked to make sets of pair-wise comparisons 
in terms of linguistic terms. Hence, p fuzzy matri-
ces 1 2, , , pZ Z Z% % %L  each corresponding to an expert 
and with triangular fuzzy numbers as its elements, 
were obtained. Fuzzy matrix is called the initial 
direct-relation fuzzy matrix. For simplicity, de-

elements ,iiz% 1,2, ,i n= K , it will be regarded as a trian-
gular fuzzy number (0, 0, 0), whenever it is necessary. 
 
STEP 3: Establishing and analyzing the structural 
model 
The linear scale transformation is used here as a 
normalization formula to transform the criteria scales 
into comparable scales. Let

sions. Aside from this, they should also consider the 
interactive relationships among these criteria. In the 
real world, the independence of the dimensions and 
criteria does not exist. It is important to find not only 
the key success factors but also to evaluate the rela-
tionships among these criteria. Strategy is an interactive 
decision-making process and is influenced by many 
factors. We understand the thinking of customers by 
Fuzzy DEMATEL approach to discuss the customer 
customers’ choice behaviors in automobile market and 
how the firms use this information to make manage-
ment strategy, to earn more benefit to them and to the 
customers. Thus key success factors are important to 
marketing managers and customers at the same time. 
According to the formula of Fuzzy DEMATEL, we find 
the influence value of dimensions and criteria; they 
show as Table 4.3 and Table 4.4.

sions

Based on the Step 4 and Step 5 of Fuzzy DE-
MATEL approach, a causal diagram is created. The 
features of decision criteria are visualized as oriented 
graphs. This study uses the threshold value (p) to obtain 
the total relationship follow different matrix. It is the 
most appropriate value to acquire a suitable relationship. 
Using the threshold values of dimensions (0.980) and 
criteria (0.371), we illustrate the diagram of the total 
relation of dimensions and criteria as shown in Figure 
4.1 and Figure 4.2.

These evaluation criteria are independent and in-
teraction, we use the FAHP weights to obtain the weights 
of key evaluation criteria by FANP method according to 
Figure 4.4. Because the weights of FAHP include the 
concept of independence, thus interacts with the FANP 
method to attain the weights of key evaluation criteria. 
The weights of evaluation criteria for FANP methods are 
shown in Table 4.8.

The weights of evaluation criteria in these situations 
are different from the weights of independent structure. 
These values obtained are more accurate in the real 
world since these include two weighted conditions: in-
dependent and interaction. Then we rank each alternative 
by SAW method which is illustrated in Table 4.8. In Ta-
ble 4.9, there is little difference in each alternative. At 
the same time, the performance value of Lexus mode is 
number one but it needs to improve to raise its perform-
ance value. In all evaluation dimension and criteria, 
Lexus ranks the number one high-class automobile in the 
customer’s mind. It is a fact the Lexus sold the highest 
quantity (6,541 vehicles) in 2005. But the two high-class 
automobile modes (Lexus and BMW) need to improve 
its product to get higher performance values.

According to the results of empirical studies, we 
find the independent structure having errors. It lacks the 
244 International Journal of Fuzzy Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, December 2007 
price (C11), car space (C13), and maintenance cost (C18); 
the criteria (C1), (C2), (C4), and (C18) have an interaction. 
Its effect, having multi-criteria considerations, is impor-
tant. Generally, customers usually consider multi-criteria 
while making purchasing decisions. It shows safety de-
vices (C1), interior equipment (C2), theft-proof devices 
(C4), and maintenance cost (C18) could have a reciprocal 
effect. 
These findings are important to managers. If these 
four criteria are good, then the dimensions of “equip-
ment factors (D1)” and “service factors (D6)” can be 
considered to be good. For this reason, these four criteria 
are the bases on how to develop the whole CCBM. The 
“theft-proof devices (C4)” is also developed, based upon 
safety devices (C1), image (C10), price (C11), and main-
tenance cost (C18). Based on these results, it is necessary 
to establish good equipment to combine price with 
high-class automobile and to develop a good manage-
ment model. Many people want to have a better thing 
rather than a cheaper price. Hence, the dimension of 
equipment factors (D1) and the dimension of price fac-
tors (D4) are deeply related. Furthermore, the “interior 
equipment (C2)” is influenced by safety devices (C1), it 
can be seen that the safety devices (C1), interior equip-
ment (C2), and theft-proof devices (C4) are quite critical 
in eighteen criteria. These three criteria- safety devices 
(C1), interior equipment (C2), and theft-proof devices (C4) 
are included in the dimension of equipment factors (D1); 
the equipment factors (D1) will be the core to develop 
the other dimensions. As far as the brand factors (D3) is 
concerned; it is a powerful dimension. The “public 
praise (C8)” and “image (C10)” is significant in the di-
mension of brand factors (D3). The “public praise (C8)” 
is influenced by the safety devices (C1). On the other 
hand, “image (C10)” is negatively influenced by the other 
criteria, because the value of ( )i j i id r d r− = −  is nega-
tive and it is also significant. The image (C10) affects the 
attraction for customers in safety devices (C1), interior 
equipment (C2), theft-proof devices (C4), comfortable-
ness (C15), and maintenance cost (C18). Furthermore, the 
image (C10) increases trust in the high-class automobile 
and discourages fraudulent of the customers. The “price 
(C11)” is special characteristics of high-class automobile. 
Customers generally want to maximize their utility and 
minimize the price they have to pay for it. We have 
shown that the “price (C11)” is important to customers. If 
the price of the high-class automobile is low and the 
safety devices (C1) and theft-proof devices (C4) are good, 
the customers are more likely to purchase the high-class 
automobile. Thus, the pricing strategy is successful. We 
show that the “price (C11)” is influenced by the safety 
devices (C1) and theft-proof devices (C4). 
In Figure 4.1, the dimension of sense perceptions 
(D5) is also weakly important. In the sense perceptions 
(D5), there are car space (C13), style appearance (C14), 
and comfortableness (C15). The  value 
and 
(i j i id r d r+ = + )
( )i j i id r d r− = −  value of style appearance (C14) is 
not significant; we skip it. The “car space (C13)” is in-
fluenced by safety devices (C1), and the “comfortable-
ness (C15)” affects the safety devices (C1) and image 
(C10). These two are the most important criteria for cus-
tomers. The safety devices (C1) and theft-proof devices 
(C4) influence the “maintenance cost (C18)”, which af-
fects the safety devices (C1) and image (C10). 
Realizing the relationships of dimensions and crite-
ria, and understanding which dimension is the key status, 
which criterion is an important role, the CCBM of 
high-class automobile market is proposed through our 
study. Managers have to know what the CCBM of 
high-class automobile market is, so that firms can make 
right marketing strategies to increase their market share. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Labora-
tory approach (DEMATEL) is proposed in 1973. Fuzzy 
theory is presented in 1965. These two were the ap-
proaches to access the high-class automobile market. 
The evaluated criteria are uncertain in the real world; 
previous studies lack this consideration of multi- dimen-
sions or multi-criteria. Due to the precious studies’ defi-
ciency, an approach of combining the DEMATEL 
method and fuzzy theory is introduced. In order for a 
company to verify management strategies and satisfy 
customer’s needs, we identify the customers’ choice be-
haviors among decision criteria of high-class automobile 
market. We take two high-class automobile modes as test 
cases, and proposed Fuzzy DEMATEL approach com-
bined with FMCDM to demonstrate the non-independent 
structure problem. Through our study, the novel hybrid 
method (Fuzzy DEMATEL approach combined with 
FMCDM) is found as a useful or effective assessment 
for businesses to meet customer’s needs.

Abstract
As the advanced integration of communications, information and vehicle technologies, 
VTS (Vehicle Telematics Systems), have been initiated for satisfying consumers’ needs with 
respect to automobile movement. Importantly, VTS enables a vehicle to become a 
multifunction mobile-services platform. Cars are now designed not only for transportation, 
but also to provide value-added services covering navigation, safety, security, information, 
communications and entertainment. Drivers or passengers can contact a call center via VTS 
to access aspired/desired services and information online. Therefore, VTS increases both the 
utility/functions and the safety of driving. Developing the optimal VTS that satisfies with 
consumers’ needs has become the foremost concern of automobile producers. This study will 
attempt to identify the required VTS utilities between distinguishing characteristics/features
of consumers and propose the ideal service combinations for the next e-era generation VTS. 
An evaluating model by six aspects to be considered/constructed, which encompasses
twenty-five criteria, is built to identify consumers’ needs for the next e-era generation VTS.
In the paper, a DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is 
used to construct the network relation-map (NRM) among the criteria of each aspect. These 
criteria are not mutually independent; instead, they have feedback mechanisms. The ANP
(Analytical Network Process) based on NRM is used to determine the relative weightings 
among those criteria. Moreover, the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity 
to Ideal Solution) is used to determine and improve the gaps among the distinguishing 
characteristics/features of consumers’ desired utilities with respect to services/provide the 
decision-maker of TSP (Telemetics Service Provider) for improving existing functions or 
planning further utilities in the next generation VTS. Based on above NRM those results can 
be served as a suggestion for the TSP to improve the existing functions or plan further 
utilities/functions for reducing the gaps and satisfying the users’ needs in next e-era 
generation VTS.

1. Introduction
With the extensive traffic network and the changes in lifestyles, automobile users will 
no longer be pleased with just a pleasant driving experience and comfortable interior. Instead, 
people will expect their navigational device to change from a closed system into an open

3e-era generation VTS. We propose a novel MCDM model which combines DEMATEL with
ANP and TOPSIS. It is generally introduced and applied with real products to illustrate the 
VTS innovation/creation. VTSs are applied to four regions (i.e. North America, Western 
Europe, Japan and Taiwan) for empirical analyses. The DEMATEL technique is used to build
the NRM among criteria of each aspect. Then, the ANP method is used to determine the 
relative weightings among those evaluation criteria based on NRM. Finally, the TOPSIS is 
used to determine and improve the gaps between consumers’ negative (the worst levels) and 
positive ideal solutions (aspired/desired levels) among utilities of the existing VTSs and 
preferences of various consumers for improving the gaps in each criterion based on whole 
systems of NRM. The gaps between the consumers’ most appropriate and most inappropriate 
service of the existing/developing VTS in each criterion are analyzed to achieve the 
aspired/desired level for satisfying the customers’ needs. Those conclusions will
serve/provide the decision-maker of TSP for improving existing gaps of functions or planning 
further utilities/functions for the next e-era generation VTS. Commercial VTSs of four 
regions (i.e. North America, Western Europe, Japan and Taiwan) are illustrated to use as
empirical analyses. The result shows that user ages will influence the preference of desired 
utilities of VTS. Those comments can help automobile manufacturers develop new e-era 
generation VTS, modulize the service functions and satisfy target consumers’ requirements 
for customized purposes. This paper recommends that TSPs improve the current utilities or 
initiate new utilities/functions on the basis of Japan’s or Taiwan’s existing VTSs in order to 
shorten the time to market.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, telematics system markets 
based on consumers’ requirements/needs of VTS are discussed. In section 3, the evaluation 
model of the best VTS market for the next e-era generation VTS is proposed by combined the 
DEMATEL technique with ANP and TOPSIS methods. In section 4, an empirical analysis of 
evaluation model of VTS market is proposed to apply to four empirical cases. Finally,
conclusions and further planning strategies for the next e-era generation VTS are proposed in 
Section 5.
2. The development of vehicles telematics markets based on consumers’ 
needs
The development experiences of VTSs in countries with advanced automobile 
industries (i.e. North America, Western Europe, and Japan) can be benchmarked by Taiwan’s 
TSPs. In Europe, the United States and other advanced countries, car users care about and 
focus on the security and safety functions of automobiles. The law of strict/severe rules is 
also legislated regarding car safety. Accordingly, emergency services, automatic notification,
stolen vehicle location assistance, security protection, vehicle diagnosis, and other safety and 
security-related services have been developed (Golob and Regan, 2001; Magnusson, et al., 
2002). In North America, many people work in cities but live in suburbs. Therefore, the car 
becomes people’s main form of transportation and car users are interested in receiving correct 
traffic information and in driving safety. Those characteristics have influenced automobile 
producers and TSPs to initiate R&D plans regarding real-time traffic information, driving 
safety and security measures. Additionally, with increased time for enjoying leisure time, 
entertainment and location-based services (abbreviated LBS) have become the basic utilities
for future VTSs. In the long history of Western Europe, under the circumstances of multiple 
languages and multiple cultures, the constructions and plans of routes are denser and more 
reticular than in North America, and the car density is higher than in North America. Like 
people in North America, the Western European consumers are also concerned about 
receiving correct traffic information and pursuing driving safety. The mainstream European 
5required utilities/functions and services for the next e-era generation VTS. The aspect of 
safety and security services would be divided into five criteria; safety and emergency services, 
remote central control services, vehicle location services, car security services and vehicle 
diagnosis and maintenance services to find out the required utilities/functions for the next 
e-era generation VTS regarding safety and security services.
2.3 Communications and Information Services
The core of VTS is communications and information services. The transmission, 
reception, and communication of information need to be operated via various 
communications and information technologies, particularly wireless technologies. 
Accordingly, automobile users can get various kinds of real-time and precise information 
when they have different needs on moving such as personal e-commerce (Anker and Arnold, 
1998; Golob and Regan, 2001). In this paper, four commercial VTS products from different 
TSPs (Taiwan, the U.S., Europe, and Japan) will be analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the 
required utilities/functions and services for the next e-era generation VTS. The aspect of 
communications and information services is divided into five evaluation criteria: mobile 
information services, user interfaces, platform integration services, information security 
protection and information update frequency to find out the required utilities/functions of the 
next e-era generation VTS regarding communications and information services.
2.4 Audio-video and Entertainment Services
Traditional automobile multimedia entertainment was a closed system; people could 
choose their favorite form of multimedia storage, and its corresponding hardware players, 
such as cassette tapes, compact discs, DVDs, MP3s, etc. With the advances in development 
of technologies, the integrated player supporting different audio-video formats has been 
created. It eases the inconvenience of converting different systems, but it cannot satisfy the 
needs of fashion, real-time, and preference between people. With the advances in 
technologies, consumers can search and download video, music, and other multimedia 
information in real-time via the VTS (Golob and Regan, 2001). In this paper, four 
commercial VTS products from different TSPs (Taiwan, the U.S., Europe, and Japan) are 
analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the required utilities/functions and services for the next 
e-era generation VTS. The aspect of audio-video and entertainment services is divided into 
four evaluation criteria: real-time multimedia services, vehicle multimedia playing systems, 
game services, and personal platform services to find out the required utilities/functions for
the next e-era generation VTS regarding audio-video and entertainment services. Six aspects
based on the above four functions (navigational and location services, safety and security 
services, communications and information services, audio-video and antertainment services) 
with the cost consideration (fee rate and payment methods) and the image consideration 
(product image) use to construct the entire evaluation network of VTS systems.
3. Building an evaluation model for the best vehicle telematics system
In this Section the general concept of evaluation model is proposed to build a best 
vehicle telematics system model using MCDM techniques for evaluating and improving the 
existing vehicle-telematic products. The study is divided into four Subsections. Subsection 
3.1 deals with the survey of VTS functions and consumers’ preference. In Subsection 3.2, the 
DEMATEL method is used to build the value-created and influence network system. In 
Subsection 3.3, the ANP method will be introduced based on influence network system. In
Subsection 3.4, the TOPSIS method for improving the gaps in each criterion will be 
described based on the whole system.

(4) Calculating the total (direct and indirect) influence matrix
The total (direct and indirect) influence matrix T as shown in Table 6 — the infinite
series of direct and indirect effects of each aspect—can be obtained by the matrix operation 
of X. The matrix T shows the final structure of aspects after the continuous process (see 
Equations (4)–(8)). Setting a threshold value, P, to filter the obvious effects can be denoted 
by the aspects of matrix T, is necessary to explain the structure of the aspects. Based on the 
matrix [ ]ij n nt T , each aspect, ijt , of matrix T provides information about how aspect i
influences aspect j. If all the information from matrix T converts to the NRM, the map will be 
too complex to show the necessary information for decision-making. To obtain an appropriate 
NRM, the decision-maker must set a threshold value for the influence level. Only some 
aspects, whose influence level in matrix T are higher than the threshold value, can be chosen 
and converted into the NRM for simplicity. The threshold value is determined by the 
decision-maker or, in this paper, by experts through discussion in real case. Like matrix X, 
contextual relationships among the aspects of matrix T can also be converted into a NRM. If 
the threshold value is too low, the map will be too complex to show the necessary 
information for decision-making as shown in Fig. 1. If the threshold value is too high, many 
aspects will be presented as independent aspects without showing the relationships with other 
aspects. Each time the threshold value increases, some aspects or relationships will be 
removed from the map. After the threshold value and relative impact-digraph-map are 
decided, the final influence result can be shown. For example, the NRM of a factor is the 
same as Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and six aspects exist in this map. The total direct/indirect influence 
matrix (T) can be gained as Equations (4)-(6). The higher the sum of column value plus row 
value ( i id r ) is shown the stronger the influence of the aspect or criterion i to the others. 
The sum of column value minus row value ( i id r ) shows the net influence relationship. 
If 0i id r  , it means the degree of affect on the others is stronger than the degree it is 
affected. This can be seen in Table 7.

questionnaire in areas with which they were familiar. In order to limit information loss from 
the DEMATEL technique’s results, threshold values (P=1.04) were determined after 
discussions with these experts and an acceptable NRM was found as shown in Table 6 and 
Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, safety & security services (S) is the main net influence aspect, 
product image (P) is the main be affected aspect, and communications & information services 
(I) is the main total influence aspect as shown in Fig. 2. and Fig. 3..

3.3 The analytical network procedure (ANP) model
The ANP method is expressed by a unidirectional hierarchical relationship among 
decision levels. The top element of the hierarchy is the overall goal for the decision model. 
The hierarchy decomposes to a more specific criterion until a level of manageable decision 
criteria is met (Meade and Presley, 2002). Under each criterion, sub-criteria elements relative 
to the criterion can be constructed. ANP was originally applied to uncertain problems with 
multiple criteria, and has been widely used in solving problems of ranking, selection, 
evaluation, optimization, and prediction decisions(Aragones-Beltran et al., 2008; Dagdeviren 
et al., 2008; Erdogmus et al., 2005; Kahraman et al., 2006; Shyur, 2006; Shyur and Shih, 
2006; Wu). The steps of the ANP method are described as follows: (1) clarifying the 
questions and constructing the structure of evaluating system, (2) designing the questionnaire 
and survey the effect, (3) pair-wise comparison to determine relative importance of 
aspects/criteria, (4) calculating the super matrix, (5) calculating the synthesical index and 
improving the gaps of each criterion (Saaty, 2006; Shyur, 2006; Shyur and Shih, 2006).

(4) Calculating the super matrix
The super-matrix can be gained by 2 +1( ) ,kT T where k is determined by assumption. 
Based on the independent ctiteria obtained in Section 3.1 and the reduced criteria derived 
from Section 3.2, the ANP method could gain criteria weights and criteria , and then obtain 
the final effectiveness of the VTS (as shown in Table 11~Table15).
(5) Calculating the synthesical index and improving the gaps of each criterion
The synthesical index can be gained as DI calculated as shown in Equation (9):

and services of the next e-era generation VTS. The results using the TOPSIS method could 
determine which one is the most appropriate for consumers. The TOPSIS procedure consists 
of the following steps: (1) calculating the normalized decision matrix (Table 16~Table18); (2)
calculating the weighted normalized decision matrix (Table 19), (3)determining the positive 
ideal and negative ideal solution; (4) calculating the distance of the utility value of each 
criterion between the positive and negative ideal solution, (5) calculating the relative 
closeness to the ideal solution, and (6) improving the gaps in criteria.

4. The empirical analysis of evaluation model for VTS market
In this Section, the study is divided into 5 subsections. Subsection 4.1 deals with the 
survey of consumer preference for VTS functions. Subsection 4.2 uses the decision making 
trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method for analysis of empirical cases. 
Subsection 4.3 uses the analytic network process (ANP) method for analysis of empirical
cases. Subsection 4.4 uses the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution 
(TOPSIS) method for analysis of empirical cases. Subsection 4.5 is the discussion.
4.1 Finding the consumer preference for VTS functions
The priority of needs of males and females is the same (as shown in Table 20). The 
utility value from the best aspect to the last is N, S, I, V. As shown in Table 21, the priority of 
demand of the 21-30 year-old group and the 31-40 year-old group is the same. The utility 
value from the best to the last is N, S, I, V. The priority of demand of the 41-50 year-old 
group, the utility value from the best to the last one is S, N, I, V. As a result, the priority of 
need of services of VTS will differ by age group. TSPs could take the age factor into 
consideration for modulizing the VTS services. The 41-50 year-old group put stress on safety 
and security services, perhaps due to their wealth and concern for family members.

4.2 Finding the degree of importance and satisfaction for VTS functions
As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 22, the analysis the degree of importance and satisfaction 
of criteria is conducted and the surveyed data is normalized into equal measuring scales. 
According to the results of surveyed data, the criteria is divided into four categories as 
follows: The first category is a high degree of satisfaction with a high degree of importance  
shown by the symbol ○ (+,+). The second category of criteria is a high degree of satisfaction
with a low degree of importance shown by the symbol ●(+,-), and the third category of 
criteria is a low degree of satisfaction with a low degree of importance shown by the symbol 
 ( -,-). The fourth category of criteria is a low degree of satisfaction with a high degree of 
importance shown by the symbol X(-, +). In this study, the strategies of the value-created 
system of VTS are proposed as follows; First, to improve those criteria (i.e. I5, C3) falling 
into the fourth category [X (-, +)]; the next immediate step is to improve those criteria (i.e. S4, 
S5, I1, I3, I4, V1, V2, V3, V4, P1) falling into the third category [ (-,-)]. The fourth category 
criteria [X (-, +)] are key factors that affect the whole satisfaction degree of VTS. About the

4.3 The empirical analysis using ANP method
The criteria weights can be gained by using the ANP method. In the process of limitation, 
multiples of the super matrix M for 13 squares and the weights can be obtained. The results 
are shown in Table 23. In this paragraph, the parenthetic value means the weight of aspect or 
criterion. The largest value of factor weights of the criterion is I5 (11.4%), the next is I1
(11.0%), P3 (8.8%), I4 (8.7%), N3 (8.1%), P2 (7.4%). From the view of aspects, the aspect of 
I (39.8%) is the most important weighted value, followed by P (21.7%), N (20.5%), S (7.2%), 
C (7.2%), and V (3.6%). With the results of using the ANP method, the key decision-making
consideration factor affects the consumer’s purchasing of VTS is I. Among the criteria of the 
aspect, I5 (11.4%), I1 (11.0%), I4 (8.7%) are the main influencing factors. Regarding the P 
aspect (21.7%), P3 (8.8%) and P2 (7.4%) play the key roles. About the N aspect (20.5%), N3
(8.1%), N2 (6.4%), and N1 (6.0%) are the main influencing factors.

sequence, the Taiwan’s T VTS (0.743) is the better one; the next ones are the Japan’s J VTS 
(0.688), the U.S.’s U VTS (0.665), and Europe’s E VTS (0.588) (gap ratio 0.412, i.e. 41.2% 
should be improved). As a result, Taiwan’s T VTS seems be the most appropriate one for 
Taiwan’s consumers.However, there are still gaps in the criteria between the T VTS and the 
consumers’ ideal VTS (25.7% should be improved). There is still much ratio to improve the 
performance of existing solutions for satisfying customers’ needs. TSP should pay efforts to 
improving the gap 25.7% to attain the real ideal solution shown by consumers’ needs.

evaluation model for the best ND; In section 4, A novel evaluation model for the ve-

the conclusions and further planning strategies for the next e-Era generation ND are 
presented. 
2   Demand Model for ND Based on Consumers’ 
Requirements/Needs 
In the ND industry, system service providers and electronic providers co-play the role 
of system integration and provide various vehicle-related navigation services and ap-
plications. Four commercial ND products in Taiwan are used to discuss as-
pired/desired functions/utilities of the ideal ND. This research organizes services and 
utilities into four dimensions: (1) Navigation and mobile information services, (2) In-
formation system services, (3) Fee Rate & Payment Methods, and (4) Product Image 
and Customer relationships. (1) Navigation and mobile information services: With the 
rapid growth of road networks and total numbers of cars on the road in Taiwan, traffic 
problems seem inevitable. With the advanced development of information and com-
munications technologies, people do not need to find roads via traditional maps, 
rather they just enter their desired destination into a navigation system, and the loca-
tion services of the ND will map the routes with vocal instructions to help people 
reach the desired location. But, in addition to directions to the destination, consumers 
are concerned about real-time traffic situations for route planning, in order to avoid 
areas of congested traffic [2]. In this paper, four commercial ND products are ana-
lyzed and benchmarked to discuss the required utilities/functions and services of the 
next e-era generation ND. The dimension of navigation & mobile information servi-
ces (NM) contains four criteria: voice-guided navigation services (NM1), traffic in-
formation (NM2), electronic map information (NM3) and mobile information services 
(NM4) to determine the required utilities/functions for the next e-era generation VTS 
regarding Navigation and Location Services. The traditional automobile multimedia 
entertainment was a closed system; people could choose their favorite form of multi-
media storage and its corresponding hardware players, such as cassette tapes, compact 
discs, DVDs, and MP3s. With the advances in the development of technologies, the 
integrated player supporting different audio-video formats has been created. It eases 
the inconvenience of converting different systems, but it cannot satisfy the needs of 
fashion, real-time, and preferences between people. With the advances in technolo-
gies, consumers can search and download videos, music, and other multimedia infor-
mation in real-time via the ND[3]. (2) Information & system services (IS): The core of 
VTS is communications and information services. The transmission, reception, and 
communication of information are needed for the operation of various communica-
tions and information technologies, particularly wireless technologies. Accordingly, 
automobile users can obtain various information of real-time and precise when they 
have different needs on moving, such as personal e-commerce [3, 4]. In this paper, 
four commercial ND products will be analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the  
required utilities/functions and services for the next e-era generation ND. The dimen-
sion of information system services contains four criteria: user interface (IS1), plat-
form integration services (IS2), information security protection (IS3), and information

point  from A to B. Low price strategy is reached by the mass manufacture and scale 
economy. From point B of Figure 1, we can see the high value strategy ( 2S ) is to fix 
the price satisfaction degree and increase the value satisfaction degree. If this hap-
pens, the direction of the product point moves from B to C. The low price strategy is 
reached by reducing the surplus function and increasing the insufficient function. 
From point C of Figure 1, we can see the strategy of diverse product portfolios ( 3S ) is 
to create diverse products in the same satisfaction level, and move the direction of the 
product point from C to D. The strategy of diverse product portfolios is reached by 
increasing the opportunity of product choice. From point D of Figure 1, we can see 
that the mass customization strategy ( 4S ) is to increase the value satisfaction degree 
by mass customization. When this is conducted, the direction of the product point 
moves from D to E. The mass customization strategy is most difficult, because it inte-
grates the customization product and mass manufacture at the same time.

3.2   Building the ISM Model 
ISM (Interpretive structural modeling) was proposed by Warfield as a computer assis-
tant methodology [5, 6]. It was used to derive and understand the interrelationship 
among the complex elements and a set of different and directly related elements can 
be structured into a comprehensive systemic model [7]. The first step of the ISM was 
to identify the variables relevant to the problem or issue. It extends with a group of 
problem-solving techniques. A structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) was devel-
oped based on the pair-wise comparison of variables. The SSIM was formed by ask-
ing questions such as “will element ei affect element ej?” If the answer was yes, then 
πij=1. If the answer was no, then πij=0. SSIM can be described as below:

consumers’ most satisfied one and most unsatisfied one is also analyzed, with respect 
to services/utilities of the existing NDs. The VIKOR method was started with the 
form of the pL metric− , which was used as an aggregating function in a compromise 
programming method and it developed the multi-criteria measure for compromise 
ranking [22, 23]. VIKOR provided a maximum group utility of the “majority” and a 
minimum individual regret of the “opponent”. The compromise solutions could be the 
base for negotiation, involving the decision makers’ preferences by criteria weights. 
where: *F is the ideal solution. *1F  represents the ideal value of criterion 1. *2F  repre-
sents the ideal value of criterion 2. The compromise solution, cF , is a feasible solu-
tion that is “closest” to the ideal *F . A compromise means an agreement estab-
lished by mutual concessions. The VIKOR method is presented with the following 
steps 
Determine the best *jf  and the worst jf −  values.

Where j is the number of feasible alternatives; i is the criterion; 
ijf  is the value of the 
ith criterion function; I1 is the cluster of utility-oriented criteria; I2 is the cluster of 
cost-oriented criteria; *jf  is the positive-ideal solution (or setting the aspired level); 
and jf −  is the positive-ideal solution (or setting the worst level). Compute the values 
iS  and iQ , 1, 2,...,i m= . The functions are:

Where: jw  are the weights of the criteria, expressing the relative importance value of 
the criteria gained via the application of the ANP method, based on NRM. Compute 
the values: jQ ,  j = 1,2,. . . ,J, by the relationship:

the weight of the strategy of “the majority of criteria” (or “the maximum group util-
ity”), here, v =0.5.; iiMin S is with a maximum group utility (majority rule), iiMin R   
is with a minimum individual regret/gap of the “opponent” for first taking improve-
ment action. vjQ and pjQ are the compromise performance of alternative i. Rank the al-
ternatives: In this paper, vjQ and pjQ  (here, v =0.5) are applied to determine the value

Finally, the reach ability matrix can be obtained by using formula (2). The star (*) 
indicates the derivative relationship, which does not emerge in the original relation-
ship matrix. The correlation between every aspect is shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.  
4.2   Computing the Weights of Criteria - the ANP Method  
The weights could be gained by using the ANP method. In the process of limitation, 
the multiples of the super matrix M, for 16 squares, and the weights of the dimensions 
and the criteria could be obtained. The results are presented in Table 3. FP is the only 
price-oriented dimension.  The largest value of factor weights of the price-oriented 
criterion is FP1 (w=28.6%), the next is FP2 (w=26.2%), FP4 (w=23.8%), and FP3 
(w=21.4%). NM, IS, and PI are the value-oriented dimensions.  The largest value of 
factor weights of the value-oriented dimension is NM (w=43.9%), the next is IS 
(w=33.3%), and finally PI (w=22.8%). The largest value of weights of the value-
oriented criterion is NM3 (w=11.8%) and the lowest one is PI1 (w=3.9%). As a result 
of using ANP method, we determine that the key decision consideration factor that  
affects the consumer’s purchasing of VTS is the communication and information  
services.

4.3   The VIKOR Model  
The compromised solution is stable within a decision making process, which could be 
the strategy to achieve maximum group utility (when v > 0.5 is needed), “by consen-
sus”v = 0.5, or with veto”(v < 0.5). Here, v is the weight of the decision making 
strategy of maximum group utility. The v would be assumed to be 0.5 for considering 
a maximum group utility of the ”majority”, and a minimum individual regret of the 
“opponent”. jjMin S is with a maximum group utility (“majority" rule) and jjMin R  is 
with a minimum individual regret of the “opponent”. vjQ is the benefit of alternative j. 
As shown in Figure 3, the vjQ  of VSI would not change the vjQ of G Company nüvi 
200W ( jQ =0) under different v. However, the vjQ of M company Leap K1 would be 
reduced as v rises and the vjQ of T company MVC 8100 would be changed slightly. As

5   Conclusions 
In this paper, we applied the concept of customer satisfaction into the development of 
products, built the evaluation model of products under the thorough consideration of 
both VSI and PSI, applied the model to position the product, and proposed the strat-
egy of product development. In the analysis of preferred alternatives, four commercial 
NDs are benchmarked.  Therefore, the competition strategies could be proposed as the 
following three types: G company adopts the high value strategy of raising the VSI, 
M company adopts the low price strategy of raising the PSI, and T company adopts 
the value-price balanced strategy. There are few commercial NDs benchmarked and 
discussed in this paper. We recommend in the future that different NDs be added to 
discuss the product development strategy of the same producer in different periods, 
and the consumers’ preferences of different characterizations.

Abstract. As the commercial fulfillment of GPS technology, there are more and more GPS-applied products 
emerged. Besides the embedded vehicle telematics device, GPS is applied and integrated to portable devices 
such as PDA and smart phone. This research would like to discuss the functions and the services of GPS-
applied products, and to decide key inducement factors driving users to buy the products. Those key factors 
would not only affect the satisfaction but also the demand of future vehicle navigation device market. There 
are four categories of navigation device (abbreviated ND), embedded ND, off-board ND, on-board ND and 
mixed ND. It is strong recommended that ND producers should survey the consumer’s demand and 
expectation of ND in advance, clarify the consumer’s requirement of various characters/features, segment the 
market and decide the niche ND. In this paper, the value evaluation model of ND is proposed to construct the 
indicator of purchasing ND, and the developing strategy of ND is also presented to initiate product roadmap. 
Criteria for evaluation are constructed via reviewing papers, interviewing experts and brain-storming. The 
ISM (interpretive structural modeling) method is used to constructing the relationship between each criterion. 
The existing NDs are sampled to benchmark the gap between the consumer’s aspired/desired utilities with 
respect to utilities of the existing/developing NDs. The VIKOR method is applied to rank the sampled NDs. 
This paper will propose the key driving criteria of purchasing new ND and compare the consumer behavior of 
various characters. Those conclusions can be served as a reference for ND producers for improving existing 
functions or planning further utilities in next e-era generation ND.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In the past years, drivers could only get limited and 
secondary traffic information from maps or radio 
broadcasting. Now new navigation device (ND) was 
developed and could be applied to satisfy drivers’ 
aspired/desire of real-time traffic information. ND not only 
provides real-time traffic information but raises the driving 
efficiency via its hint on optimal route. Global positioning 
system (GPS) and geographical information system (GIS) 
technologies had been applied to form vehicle navigation 
system. Drivers could input key-in their required 
information such as present location and desired destination, 
and the ND would give useful hints on the optimal route, 
traffic congestion, required driving time. Drivers could 
refer such hints shown on LCD and turn their driving route 
according to real-time traffic condition. 
GPS was originally designed for military purposes, 
and then to civilian applications. GPS-applied technologies 
are more and more flourishing since more precise 
positioning and graphics technologies are going to be 
developed. Nowadays GPS is widely applied to Embedded 
Navigation Device (Gonzalez-Perez and Henderson-
Sellers), Portable Navigation Device (PND), Personal 
Digital Assistant (PDA) and Smart phone. END is proposed 
to be equipped in high class car for luxury good by 
automobile producers. END is a highly system-integrated 
device and takes control of air conditioner, vehicle body, 
telematics, vehicle safety, communication and 
entertainment utilities. It is mainly promoted as a value-
added device by automobile producers and therefore its 
price is higher than other devices. PND is equipped with 
car cradle attached on the windscreen or placed upon the 
instrument board. Navigation is a main utility of PND, and 
however entertainment utility is also integrated inside in 
recent years. PND can be easily demounted and installed 
among different cars and therefore lots of consumers apply 
it to unequipped cars such as the second-hand car or 
  3
planning in order to avoid areas of congested traffic (Chen 
and Stauss, 1997). In this paper, four commercial ND 
products are analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the 
required utilities/functions and services of the next e-era 
generation ND. The dimension of Navigation and Location 
Services (NLS) contains three criteria: (1) Voice-Guided 
Navigation Services (VNS), (2) Traffic Information, and (3) 
Electronic Map Information to find out the required 
utilities/functions for the next e-era generation VTS 
regarding Navigation and Location Services.  
Traditional automobile multimedia entertainment was a 
closed system; people could choose their favorite form of 
multimedia storage, and its corresponding hardware players, 
such as cassette tapes, compact discs, DVDs, MP3s, etc. 
With the advances in development of technologies, the 
integrated player supporting different audio-video formats 
has been created. It eases the inconvenience of converting 
different systems, but it cannot satisfy the needs of fashion, 
real-time, and preference between people. With the 
advances in technologies, consumers can search and 
download video, music, and other multimedia information 
in real-time via the ND (Golob and Regan, 2001). 
 
2.2 Communications and Information Services  
The core of VTS is communications and information 
services. The transmission, reception, and communication 
of information need to be operated via various 
communications and information technologies, particularly 
wireless technologies. Accordingly, automobile users can 
get various kinds of real-time and precise information when 
they have different needs on moving such as personal e-
commerce (Anker and Arnold, 1998; Golob and Regan, 
2001). In this paper, four commercial ND products will be 
analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the required 
utilities/functions and services for the next e-era generation 
ND. The dimension of Communications and Information 
Services contains four criteria: (1) User Interfaces, (2) 
Platform Integration Services, (3) Information Security 
Protection, and (4) Information Update Frequency to find 
out the required utilities/functions of the next e-era 
generation ND regarding Communications and Information 
Services. 
 
2.3 Fee Rate & Payment Method   
In this paper, four commercial ND products will be 
analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the required 
utilities/functions and services for the next e-era generation 
ND. The dimension of Fee Rate & Payment Method 
contains four criteria: (1) Service Fee Rate, (2) Pricing, (3) 
Payment Method, and (4) Payment Channel to find out the 
required utilities/functions of the next e-era generation ND 
regarding Fee Rate & Payment Method. 
 
2.4 Product Image and Customer Relationship 
In this paper, four commercial ND products will be 
analyzed and benchmarked to discuss the required 
utilities/functions and services for the next e-era generation 
ND. The dimension of Product Image and Customer 
relationship contains four criteria: (1) Product Design, (2) 
Pricing, (3) Brand Image, After-Sales Services, and (4) 
Privacy Policy to find out the required utilities/functions of 
the next e-era generation ND regarding Product Image and 
Customer relationship. 
 
3. BUILDING A NOVEL EVALUATION MODEL 
FOR THE BEST ND 
 
In this Section the general concept of evaluation 
model is proposed to build a best ND model using MCDM 
techniques for evaluating and improving the existing ND 
products. The study is divided into three Subsections. 
Subsection 3.1 deals with the survey of ND’s 
functions/utilities and consumers’ preference. In Subsection 
3.2, the ISM is used to construct the structural NRM among 
the criteria of each dimension. Additionally, the analytic 
network process model (abbreviated ANP) is used to 
determine the relative weightings among those criteria 
according to structural NRM. In Subsection 3.3, this paper 
would like to determine and improve the gaps among the 
distinguishing characteristics/features of consumers’ 
desired utilities with respect to services and provides the 
decision-maker of ND for improving existing functions or 
planning further utilities in the next e-era generation ND. 
Based on above NRM those results can be served as a 
reference for the ND producers to improve the existing 
functions or plan further utilities/functions for reducing the 
gaps and satisfying the users’ needs in next e-era generation 
ND. 
 
3.1 Survey for VTS functions and consumer preference 
In this Subsection based on Section 2, consumers 
answer the questionnaires by considering the following 
four dimensions: (1) Navigation and Location Services, (2) 
Communications and Information Services, (3) Fee rate and 
Payment Methods, and (4) Product Image. These four 
dimensions encompass sixteen criteria to identify their real 
needs for the next e-era generation ND. Descriptions of the 
contents of each criterion are shown in Table 1. 
Most customers make purchasing decisions for 
products and services. They not only chase to improve the 
functions and increase the product value, but also consider 
product price. So the purchasers choose between product 
low price and high value. Therefore, a suitable value 
created system should integrate the price and the value of 
product by mass customization for good fit in custom-made 
and for low cost in mass production to satisfy the 
  5

prefer. 
Payment method (FP3) Flexible payment methods can satisfy consumers with 
different spending habits. 
Payment channel (FP4) More payment channels can enhance consumers’ 
convenience. 
Product image (PI) 
Product design (PI1) More popular product design, more selective & easier to 
carry can stimulate the desire to buy the product.

Services (PI3) 
More after-sales service locations & wider channels, 
consumers will feel confident about maintenance & warranty 
services. 
Privacy Policy (P4I) More stringent privacy protection policies can avoid the 
leakage of car & personal information for criminal use. 
Note: The parenthetic code will be used to represent the dimension or the 
criterion throughout the rest of this paper. 
 
3.2 Building the ISM model 
ISM (Interpretive structural modeling) was proposed 
by Warfield as a computer assistant methodology (Agarwal, 
et al., 2007; Sharma, et al., 1995). It is used for derive and 
understanding the interrelationship among complex 
elements and a set of different and directly related elements 
can be structured into a comprehensive systemic model 
(Fontela, 2003). The first step of ISM is to identify the 
variables relevant to the problem or issue. And it extends 
with a group problem-solving technique. A structural self-
interaction matrix (SSIM) is developed based on pair-wise 
comparison of variables. The SSIM is formed by asking 
questions such as “will element ei affect element ej?” If the 
answer is yes, then πij=1. If the answer is no, then πij=0. 
SSIM can be described as below:

               (1) 
 
The ei means the ith element. The πij means the 
interrelationship between ith and jth elements. D is a SSIM. 
After we established the SSIM, we can convert it into a 
reachability matrix and its transitivity is checked such as 
formula (1) and (2) (Huang, et al., 2005): 
IDM +=                     (2) 
1+== kk* MMM 1>k          (3) 
where I is the unit matrix, k denotes the powers, and 
M* is the reachability matrix. Note that the reachability 
matrix is under the operators of the Boolean multiplication 
and addition (i.e. 1 · 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 1, 1·0=0, 1+0=0+1=1, 
1·0=0·1=0). For example:

3.3 The analytical network procedure (ANP) model 
ANP method is expressed by a unidirectional 
hierarchical relationship among decision levels (Blair, et al., 
2002; Niemira and Saaty, 2004; Saaty, 2006). The top 
element of the hierarchy is the overall goal for the decision 
model. The hierarchy decomposes to a more specific 
criterion until a level of manageable decision criteria is met 
(Meade and Presley, 2002). Under each criterion, sub-
criteria elements relative to the criterion can be constructed. 
The ANP separates complex decision problems into 
elements within a simplified hierarchical system. The steps 
of the ANP method are described as follows: (1) clarifies 
the questions and constructs the framework, (2) designs the 
questionnaires and survey, (3) determines the relative 
importance of factors by pair-wise comparison to calculate 
factor weights by dependence and feedback, and check the 
consistency of logical judgment, (4) calculates the 
supermatrix, (5) determines the factor weights (Shyur, 2006; 
Shyur and Shih, 2006). 
   
3.4 The VIKOR model 
After establish the evaluation model including criteria 
and given weights in each crision, the next step is to 
evaluate the performance of benchmarked alternatives. The 
more utilities/functions of the ND, the more expensive the 
ND is. Thus, among the evaluation model of ND, 
functional criteria are mutually conflicted with cost criteria. 
The VIKOR method is used to evaluate and rank the 
performance of benchmarked alternatives. The VIKOR 
method is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) 
method, and applies to solve a discrete decision problem 
with noncommensurable and conflict criteria(Opricovic and 
Tzeng, 2002; 2003; 2004; 2007; Tzeng, et al., 2002a; Tzeng, 
et al., 2002b; Tzeng, et al., 2005). This method focuses on 
ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives, and 
determines compromise solutions for a problem with 
conflicting criteria, which can help the decision makers to 
reach a final decision. Here, the compromise solution is a 
feasible solution which is the closest to the ideal one, and a 
compromise means an agreement established by mutual 
concessions. Thus the VIKOR method would be applied to 
rank and evaluate the performance of proposed GPS 
alternatives.

According to the results of surveyed data, the criteria 
is divided into four categories as follows: The first category 
is a high degree of satisfaction with a high degree of 
importance  shown by the symbol ○ (+,+). The second 
category of criteria is a high degree of satisfaction with a 
low degree of importance shown by the symbol ●(+,-), and 
the third category of criteria is a low degree of satisfaction 
with a low degree of importance shown by the symbol 
▲ ( -,-). The fourth category of criteria is a low degree of 
satisfaction with a high degree of importance shown by the 
symbol X(-, +). In this study, the strategies of the value-
created system of VTS are proposed as follows; First, to 
improve those criteria (i.e. NM4, IS2, IS3, FP2, FP3, FP4, 
PI1, PI2, PI4) falling into the third category [▲ (-,-)]. 
About the third category criteria [▲ (-,-)], a higher degree 
of importance would affect the whole satisfaction degree of 
ND in the short run as consumers’ requirement coming 
higher.

4.2 Empirical study in ISM techniques 
The real practice is illustrated by using ISM method to 
obtain a reachability matrix is demonstrated as following. 
The selected criteria of ND include: (1) Navigation 
and Location Services (N), (2) Communications and 
Information Services (I), (3) Fee rate and Payment Methods 
(F). (4) Product Image and Customer relationship. The 
original interrelationship data among all dimensions is 
listed as Table 3. 
Table 3. The original interrelation matrix

Setting the threshold value=0.73. If the value of the 
element inside the matrix is >0.73, the value would be 
counted as 1. If the value of the element is <0.73, the value 
would be counted as 0. Then interrelation matrix (D) could 
be gained and matrix(M) could gained using formula (1) as 
Table 4 and Table 5.

4.3 Computing the weights of criteria-the ANP method  
The ANP method are described as follows: 1.clarifies 
the questions and constructs the framework, 2.designs the 
questionnaires and survey, 3.determines the relative 
importance of factors by pair-wise comparison to calculate

15. As shown in Table 15, FP is the only price-oriented 
dimension, and the largest value of factor weights of the 
price-oriented criterion is FP1 (w=28.6%), the next is FP2 
(w=26.2%), FP4 (w=23.8%), FP3 (w=21.4%). NM, IS, PI 
are the value-oriented dimension, and the largest value of 
factor weights of the value-oriented dimension is NM 
(w=43.9%), the next is IS (w=33.3%), PI (w=22.8%). The 
largest value of factor weights of the value-oriented 
criterion is NM3 (w=11.8%) and the lowest one is PI1 
(w=3.9%). 
As the results of using ANP method, the key decision 
consideration factor affects the consumer’s purchasing of 
VTS is Communication and Information Services. Among 
the criteria of the aspect, Information Update Frequency 
(w=11.4%), Mobile Information Services (w=11.0%), 
Information Security Protection (w=8.7%) are the main 
influent factors. About the aspect of Product Image 
(w=21.7%), After-sales Services (w=8.8%), Brand Image 
(w=7.4%) plays the key roles. About the aspect of 
Navigation and Location Services (w=20.5%), Electronic 
Map Information (w=8.1%), Traffic Information (w=6.4%), 
Voice-guided Navigation Services (w=6.0%) are the main 
influent factors.

4.4.4 Rank the alternatives 
    The 
j
Q  under different v is shown in table 20 & 21, 
jQ (here v =0.5) is applied to determine the value satisfaction 
index (VSI) and price satisfaction index (PSI). 
j
Q (here v 
=0.5) could also consider the index of the maximum group 
utility and the minimum individual regret of the “opponent”, 
where 
j
Q smaller is better, and 0≦
j
Q 1. However this ≦
research prefers 1-
j
Q  for evaluation which means 1-
j
Q  
bigger is better. When the v value of value satisfaction is 0.5, 
then v=
j
Q , VSI=1-
j
Q , and when the v value of price 
satisfaction is 0.5, then p=
j
Q , PSI=1-
j
Q . Therefore VSI and 
PSI of different alternatives could be gained. As shown in 
table 22, under v=0.5, 
j
Q of VSI=0.726, VSI=0.274 of M 
company Leap K1 and 
j
Q of PSI=0, PSI=1 of M company 
Leap K1. As shown in figure 7, the distribution of VSI and 
PSI would be shown by two-dimension-axis graph, the 45 
degree slope line means equal utility which means the sum of 
VSI and PSI is fixed (i.e. VSI=PSI). The total satisfaction 
degree is higher rightward and is lower leftward. Thus the 
value of total satisfaction from high to low is M company 
Leap K1(0.274, 1.000), G company nüvi 200W (1.000, 
0.162), T company MVC 8100 (0.529, 0.521) and A company 
R700. The competition strategies could be proposed as the 
following three types, G company adopts the high value 
strategy of raising the VSI, M company adopts the low price 
strategy of raising the PSI, T company adopts the value-price 
balanced strategy, and A company is relatively weak at PSI 
and VSI. A company is suggested to take balanced strategy 
first to raise the PSI and VSI, and next step is to adopt those 
strategies like what G company and M company does.

5. CONCLUSION 
GPS-applied products have been emerging quickly, and 
have become the quasi-essential goods from luxury goods in 
the past. The quality and quantity of electronic maps has been 
progressed rapidly in order to satisfy at least the consumers’ 
acceptable requirements. since more precise positioning and 
graphics technologies are going to be developed. Therefore, 
in the fierce competition GPS-applied market, electronic 
maps with general device would not satisfy the consumer 
anymore. Taiwan’s enterprises have developed special 
segmented applications for bicycle and motorcycle riders. 
Water resistance, shockproof, highly-bright LCD and 
entertainment utilities such as digital television are also 
emphasized for such products. This paper would like to apply
