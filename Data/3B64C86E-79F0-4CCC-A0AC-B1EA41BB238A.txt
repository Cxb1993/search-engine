Cost estimation begins in the early stages of construction projects and may repeat 
frequently during the entire life cycle. The reliability of cost estimation is important to ensure 
the success of the project since it serves as the foundation for making critical financial 
decisions. 
In construction projects, the prices of all the resources (material, equipment, and labor) are 
exposed to certain levels of uncertainty (Russell and Ranasinghe 1992). To manage such 
inherent uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulation methods have been widely applied for various 
types of projects, such as (Touran 1993; Elkjaer 2000). In Monte Carlo simulation, a 
mathematical model is constructed based on pre-specified probability distributions, which 
describes the possible outcomes of major cost elements involved in a project, and run to see 
what the overall project cost will be for each simulation replication. After a certain number of 
replications, the collected samples are used to derive the output distribution of the overall 
project cost. 
An important enhancement of ordinary simulation methods has been directed to consider 
statistical correlations (dependencies) between cost elements. The correlation represents the 
co-movement of two cost elements; when one is more expensive, the other tends to cost more 
as well (or cost less for a negative correlation). Arguments and evidences for the existence of 
correlations and their profound impact on simulation results have been presented in the 
literature (Diekmann 1983; Wall 1997). To treat the correlations, various approaches have 
been proposed, such as (Touran and Wiser 1992; Wang 2002). 
The goal of this project is to develop a simulation-based method, which incorporates 
correlations between cost elements with more modeling capabilities. The present method 
fulfills the following requirements: 
1. To allow the distributions (i.e., marginal distributions) of individual cost elements to be of

5.  Normalize the diagonal elements to ensure unit diagonals (fundamental requirement for a 
correlation matrix): 
 EMEM =  (4)
where M  is the new (approximated) correlation matrix. 
A preliminary test is performed to ensure the effectiveness of the setup stage. We use a 
documented 19  × 19 correlation matrix (Chau 1995) as an example. This correlation matrix 
has been proved to be non-positive-semidefinite (Ranasinghe 2000). Our tasks here are to 
apply the proposed steps and to check if the differences between the approximated values and 
the original specifications are small enough. The differences are quantified in two metrics: 
Lave (average) and Lmax (maximum):

where M is the specified correlation matrix and M* is the approximated one; n is the number 
of cost elements. 
|MM|max *max −= > jiL  (6
)
After performing the correction steps, Lave is 18108954.4 −×  and Lmax is 15107208.1 −× . 
This shows empirically that the setup stage can adjust the infeasible correlation matrix to a 
feasible one with ignorable changes. 
The setup stage is to treat possible infeasibility, which may result from either erroneous 
input or inconsistent estimation. In other words, the setup stage would not be of any good if 
the correlation coefficients are incorrect or inconsistent. Thus a careful review is critical to

For Step 1, there exist several efficient algorithms to perform the Cholesky decomposition. 
The generation of a uniform random vector in Step 2 is a standard feature supported by 
almost all the popular computer languages (such as C++, Java, Visual Basic, FORTRAN). 
The transformation in Step 3 can be approximated by the following equation:  
Pi=(Yi0.135-(1-Yi) 0.135)/0.1975 (7)

The marginal CDF in Step 6 can be of any type of distribution as long as their inverses can 
be calculated either directly or via approximation. This is why the proposed method is able to 
treat different kinds of distributions simultaneously. It is much easier when the marginal 
distribution has a closed-form inverse (such as uniform or triangular). Otherwise, one has to 
rely on numerical approximation algorithms to find the inverses of the commonly-used 
 8 
 
 
of “services” and “external works”. These arrangements have been justified in previous 
sections. 
Table 2 shows the rank correlation coefficients between the cost elements of the full data 
set. Before applying the proposed method, the rank correlation coefficients are reviewed and 
adjusted to verify (1) if they can reflect the actual behavior of the correlations and (2) if they, 
derived from past data, are suitable for the current project. This process is based on practical 
judgments and can complement pure mathematic analysis. In this example, the rank 
correlation coefficients between “external works” and other cost elements are adjusted to be 
zero. 
A simulation experiment is designed to implement the proposed method and to evaluate 
the impact of correlations between cost elements. In the experiment, every simulation 
replication leads to a sample of the project cost by simply summing up cost elements drawn 
from individual distribution. The output statistics can then be used to assess the behavior of 
the true project cost.  
After 1000 simulation replications, Table 3 lists the descriptive statistics for the unit cost 
of the project. To assess the impact of correlations, we compare two scenarios: including and 
excluding correlations. Fig. 1 is a box-and-whisker plot which is used to visually compare the 
distributions of the two scenarios. The first observation is that both distributions are skewed 
to the right because the mean (shown as the cross) is larger than the median. 
The second observation is that the scenario of “including correlations” has a much longer 
tail to the right than that of “excluding correlation”. This indicates the former has a larger 
variability (uncertainty) than the latter. This conclusion is unsurprising because the former 
has a much greater standard deviation that the latter (149.55 versus 108.92, a 37% difference). 
Consequently, the 95% confidence interval of the former is much wider than that of the latter. 
Fig. 2 plots the CDFs of both scenarios. A practical use of the chart is to estimate the

The modeling capabilities of the proposed method are empirically validated by an 
application to a modified British data set consisted of 216 office buildings. With the modeling 
capabilities, the proposed method helps cost estimators assess the true impact of correlations 
between cost elements on the project unit cost. The impact has been shown significant and 
should be considered with caution.
