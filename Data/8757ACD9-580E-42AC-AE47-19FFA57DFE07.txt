英文摘要 
ESD discharge current is distributed 
non-uniformly along the channel width in a 
MOSFET usually. The substrate resistance 
plays a critical role in this case. This project 
will study the following issues: (1) the role 
and mechanism which the substrate resistance 
may play in nonuniform ESD current 
distribution, (2) device/circuit analysis and 
design of a gate- and- substrate common 
triggering NMOSFET. This research will 
mainly utilize electro- thermal simulation with 
device lattice temperature in technology 
computer-aided design. The simulation will 
extend its quasi-three-dimensional or 
horizontal top-view layout capability, and also 
device-circuit mixed mode to integrate a 
device structure itself and its peripheral 
equivalent circuits. These abilities can 
reproduce the behaviors and properties of a 
device/circuit region under the real ESD 
environment, thus to deal with ESD 
three-dimensional effect. After that, based on 
the simulation results, the device/circuit 
testkey layout design will be carried out and 
foundried for measurement and failure 
analysis. The simulation will further used to 
help analyze and evaluate the results of the 
various experiment conditions, also to verify 
the validity of the assumptions. At last, robust 
ESD protection devices/circuits will be 
developed according to the above research 
activities. 
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
Electrostatic discharge（ESD）issues 
has been a serious problem in semiconductor 
components and systems. When device size 
shrinks continuously, its ESD performance 
degrades more and more [1]-[3]. Gate- 
grounded NMOS’s are commonly used as 
ESD protection devices, but the ESD 
capability is not enough. Because the 
multi-finger layout style has nonuniform 
current behavior and poses an ESD threshold 
limit. Gate-coupling technique that increases 
gate bias enables uniform ESD current 
distribution [4][5]. But this style still has its 
weaknesses. Because the gate coupling has 
gate over-driving problem and this limits its 
ESD capability. The main ESD current is 
designed to conduct through the MOS surface 
channel and a very wide channel dimension 
has to be used. This will consume quite large 
chip area either [5]. Therefore this project 
develops substrate-and-gate- triggering (SGT) 
structure, which utilizes dynamic threshold 
MOS (DTMOS) [7][9] technique to resolve 
the above problem [10]. This project further 
- 4 - 
RC-GCNMOS or the RC-inv- GCNMOS case. 
The RC-GCNMOS and RC-inv- GCNMOS 
cases both exhibit large gate voltages, which 
lead to gate over- driving problem. On the 
other hand, RC-inv- SGTNMOS clamps the 
gate voltage to about 1V.  
Next the analysis turns to the wider 
device cases. Fig.8 shows the voltage/current 
transient response of two intrinsic transistors 
M1 and M2, for comparison between the 
RC-inv- SGTNMOS and RC-GCNMOS (dash 
line) with channel width 1500µm. Fig.9 
exhibits the voltage/current transient response 
of two intrinsic transistors M1 and M2, for 
comparison between the RC-inv-SGTNMOS 
and RC-inv-GCNMOS (dash line) with 
channel width 1500µm. The RC-inv 
-SGTNMOS has much faster drain voltage rise 
time by one order of magnitude. The rise time 
difference becomes very larger than the 
300µm case for the RC-GCNMOS and 
RC-inv- GCNMOS cases. Thus the 
RC-inverter triggering circuit plays a more 
critical role in wide and large protection 
devices.  
An RC network gate-driven ESD clamp 
circuit always leads to the so-called gate over 
driven problem [11]. The high voltage at gate 
introduces a serious damage effect that is due 
to over heating located under the gate channel, 
thus the device failure threshold degrades. 
From Fig. 10 the transient response of RC 
gate-coupled GCNMOS, the effective gate 
resistance is 15kΩ. A tendency is apparent 
that the gate voltage rises while the gate 
coupled capacitance increases. The gate 
voltage reaches 9.3V corresponding to the RC 
time constant about 200 nsec. In contrast, the 
RC SGTNMOS performances well in the gate 
transient response with different gate 
capacitance parameters as shown in figure 14. 
No matter the increase in gate -coupled 
capacitance, the gate voltage always remains 
around 0.8V because the substrate connection 
can help eliminate the influence of the gate 
bias effect.  
Fig. 12 (a) and (b) reveal the temperature 
distribution of the transistor M1 and M2 in the 
RC-inv-SGTNMOS case with channel width 
1500µm. They illustrate simultaneous self- 
heating in both M1 and M2 transistors. 
 
四、 結論與討論 
A new substrate/gate triggering (SGT) 
device /circuit which combines the advantages 
of gate- coupling and substrate triggering 
technique has been developed. The 
comparisons among the gate- grounded 
NMOS, resistance/ RC gate-coupled NMOS 
and resistance/ RC substrate/gate triggering 
NMOS show the effectiveness of this device. 
This structure has the following advantages： 
it threshold voltage can be reduced by the 
substrate voltage, hence enables enhancement 
of drain current. This structure can maintain 
the minimum channel length with normal 
off-state leakage current and without 
hot-carrier effect concern either. The gate over 
driven problem can be eliminated by the 
SGTNMOS structure. Finally we reorganized 
the improvements of this device as follows: 
 The non-uniform turn-on issue can be 
solved by the SGTNMS and this leads to 
a good It2 performance such as 
2.61Amps. 
 The gate coupled resistance layout area 
can be reduced by 30%. 
Further, the RC-inv-SGTNMOS circuit 
exhibits a good ESD capability with a higher 
second breakdown current It2 2.95A. As 
Compared with the RC-inv- GCNMOS and 
RC-GCNMOS styles, the RC-inv- SGTNMOS 
has faster drain voltage response time and also 
a higher It2 value as well as no gate over- 
driving effect. Therefore the RC-inv- 
SGTNMOS has better ESD performance than 
RC-inv-GCNMOS and RC-GCNMOS, the 
RC-inv- SGTNMOS with only minor channel 
width size can reach a good ESD capability.

Abstract-An SCR-buried BJT with a high holding voltage is 
developed for ESD protection in a 0.6 µm high voltage 10V 
process. This device simply consists of a floating P+ diffusion 
buried in a parasitic NPN BJT. A robust 6~7KV ESD threshold 
and high- latchup-immune 15~18V holding voltage can be 
achieved by layout optimization of the anode-to-floating- 
P+-diffusion spacing and this P+ diffusion width.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The demand of high-voltage technologies increases recently 
for analog and smart power IC applications. ESD protection in 
these high voltage technologies becomes more difficult to 
handle than that in standard CMOS logic technologies. High 
voltage operation results in high power dissipation and 
relatively weak ESD threshold of N-type carrier devices such 
as NMOS or NPN BJT [1]-[3]. The parasitic NPN BJT is 
difficult to turn on [1][2]. Thus options of ESD protection 
devices are far less than the standard technologies. Latchup 
immunity is also harder to achieve because high voltage power 
supply requires a larger latchup-free holding voltage [3]-[5].  
In view of the above difficulty, the purpose of this work is to 
develop an ESD protection device for trade-off between 
latchup and ESD in high voltage CMOS technologies. This 
structure is simply a parasitic BJT accompanied with a floating 
P+ diffusion in its N-well. It can be regarded as a parasitic BJT 
structure in parallel with a buried SCR. We will discuss the 
holding voltage adjustment and the second breakdown as well 
as ESD properties related to layout parameters. Numerical 
device simulation will further investigate its detail 
characteristics and operational key points. 
 
II. DEVICE STRUCTURE AND ESD 
CHARACTERIZATION 
 
Fig. 1(a) shows the cross-sectional diagram and equivalent 
circuit of the SCR-buried BJT device. This NPN BJT is simply 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1(a) The device structure and equivalent circuit of the SCR-buried BJT. 
 
composed of the N+ cathode in the P-substrate as its emitter, 
the P-substrate as its base, the N-well as its collector, and an 
additional floating P+ diffusion in the N-well. The devices were 
fabricated in a 0.6 µm high voltage 10V CMOS process. Its 
equivalent circuit is the parallel connection of a buried PNPN 
SCR part and an NPN BJT part. The buried SCR part can be 
further regarded as a reverse-biased PN diode formed by the 
floating P+/N-well/ N+ anode in series with the parasitic SCR. 
In this device the width W of the floating P+ region, and the 
spacing L between the N+ anode and floating P+ region are two 
critical structure parameters related to ESD ability. 
Additionally, a lateral SCR, a parasitic NPN BJT, and a 
high-voltage NMOS (HVNMOS) FET were also fabricated as 
comparisons. The only structural difference of this SCR-buried 
BJT from a standard SCR is its open interconnection at the P+ 
region just like a floating P+ anode in an SCR. The standard 
SCR, parasitic NPN BJT, and SCR-buried BJT all have the

longer, the total resistance of the PN diode increases. The 
voltage drop across the PN diode becomes larger and the final 
VH increases. This relation can be formulated as: 
eq_DHH_SCRDH_SCRH RIN
1VVVV ×+=+=              (1) 
where VH, VH_SCR, and VD are the voltage drop across the whole 
structure, buried SCR and PN diode, respectively, at holding 
point. 1/N is the ratio of the current magnitude that flows 
through the buried SCR to the total current, N factor is roughly 
3.8, which is revealed by the simulation. Req_D is the equivalent 
resistance of the diode at the holding point, and ranges from 
410Ω to 6.5kΩ as the L increases from 0 to 4µm. Increase in 
the Req_D make the VH value of this device tunable. For the 
device operation beyond the holding point, the high current 
will heat up the device faster through Joule heating power, as L 
increases the VH and Ron also increases so that the power 
consumption increases accordingly. This self- heating will 
accelerate the coming of thermal breakdown [7], thus It2 
decreases with respect to L. As to the NPN BJT, though its VH 
values are very high >20V, its DC I-V curves do not show 
snapback behaviors so that its ESD thresholds drop from 
medium to very low values. Its TLPG I-V curve in Fig. 1(b) 
also indicates that it fails immediately after its curve traces into 
the snapback state. Actually some of its TLPG data for the 
multiple samples show much lower It2 thresholds unstably. 
Hence, a simple additional floating P+ region in the 
SCR-buried BJT has a great influence on its electrical 
characteristics. 
The HBM ESD voltages and their per-µm data of all devices 
versus L are also shown in Fig. 2(b). The average ESD 
thresholds of the SCR-buried BJT descend slightly between 
125V/µm (7KV) and 116V/µm (6.5KV) as the L spacing 
increases from 0 to 4µm. The ESD performance per µm is far 
superior to that of the parasitic NPN BJT at L=1 / 2µm as well 
as the HVNMOS by 82% and 19 times, respectively. The ESD 
levels for most SCR-buried BJT cases are nearly the same as 
that of the normal SCR. The ESD level for the L=0µm case is 
the same as that of the normal SCR and its It2 value is very 
close to that of the SCR. The minimum ESD value 116V/µm 
(6.5KV) occurs at L=4µm. This device has the largest turn-on 
resistance Ron=4.1Ω. This result reveals apparently that a larger 
turn-on resistance will heat up device itself faster and reduce 
the It2 level due to the higher power consumption.  
 
B. I-V characteristics with respect to width W 
Fig. 2(c) shows the trend of the It2 per unit width versus the 
width W. When the W increases from 1 to 4µm with the 
spacing L fixed at 1µm, the It2 increases linearly from 
27.9A/µm (1.6A) to 52.6A/µm (2.9A) and the Ron decreases 
from 5.4 to 2.4Ω. The It2 values are higher than that of the NPN 
BJT at L=1µm by 30%~2.5 times, and higher than that of the 
HVNMOS by 34 times at W=4µm. As the W increases, the 
wider heavily-doped P+ region will provide a lower series 
resistance along the current flow path as compared with 
lightly-doped N-well region otherwise. The Ron as well as its 
voltage drop should decrease. Therefore, self-heating effect 
will be less serious, and the higher It2 together with better ESD 
threshold should be obtained. Fig. 2(d) and (e) illustrate the VH 
and the HBM/ESD levels per unit width versus W 
characteristics, respectively. As for the VH tendency, although 
the VH with L=1µm falls rapidly from 33 to 2.5V, the VH with 
L=2µm can rise up to 16.5V (RT) and 9.5V (85°C). The VH is 
determined by the SCR structure and the length of the diode 
lightly doped region. As the W increases from 1 to 4µm with L 
fixed at 1µm in Fig. 2(e), the average ESD failure threshold 
will increases from 50.6V/µm (2.8KV) to 119V/µm (6.7KV). 
The ESD levels beyond W=3µm are higher

Fig. 2(e) The HBM ESD levels per unit width versus W. 
 device is dominated by the parasitic NPN BJT in parallel with 
the series connection of the buried SCR and the reverse-biased 
diode as shown in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 1(a). Hence, the 
reverse-biased diode is the key point in the ESD protection 
performance. As the L increases, the longer diode adds to the 
increase of the Ron so that it leads to the decrease of the It2 and 
its voltage drop sustains a higher VH. The W can further 
provide an adjustment parameter to raise It2 value for 
compensation. When its width is wider, the heavily-doped P+ 
region provides low impedance for the whole Ron. It can inject 
more holes into the well/substrate region and in turn conduct 
more It2 current, i.e., the buried SCR aids current conduction. 
Thus the wider floating P+ region can sustain a higher It2. As a 
whole, the SCR-buried BJT exhibits not only a far superior 
ESD performance than either the NPN BJT or HVNMOS, but 
also compatible with the normal SCR in addition to a much 
higher VH. 
It is noted that this SCR-buried BJT structure was 
simply constructed in the standard 3.3V supply voltage region. 
Due to the excellent wide range variety of its VH, it is still 
suitable in high voltage operation with strong ESD robustness 
and high latchup immunity up to about 15V. It is believed that 
with proper modulation of the layout parameters this simple 
structure could also be feasible for the applications of much 
higher voltage operations by just implementing it in the high 
voltage layout area according to the high voltage design rules. 
In addition, this work did not deal with the triggering property 
of the SCR-buried BJT. Of course its present triggering voltage 
Vt1 is too high for the practical use of ESD protection just like 
that of an intrinsic SCR. However, low- voltage- triggering 
mechanism for SCR’s (LVTSCR) [10] can be easily 
implemented in this new structure to realize the same voltage 
triggering property of either HV or standard 3.3V/5V logic 
devices. This kind of mechanism can be laid out in the N+ 
cathode side to trigger the device earlier and will not interfere 
the function of the floating part. Thus this BJT structure is 
suitable for ESD applications in high voltage operation as well 
as normal standard logic technologies. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
An SCR-buried BJT for high latchup immunity and robust 
ESD protection has been developed. This structure consists of a 
BJT in parallel with a buried SCR and a reverse-biased diode. 
It is shown that the floating P+ region plays the key role in this 
device. The devices with holding voltage up to 18V and ESD 
level up to 7000V are demonstrated for ESD protection 
application. The holding voltage of this device is tunable by the 
spacing between the N+ anode and floating P+ region. 
Meanwhile, the ESD failure threshold can be further enhanced 
and optimized with the wider floating P+ region.

same total device width 56µm. The W and L parameters in the 
SCR and SCR-buried BJT cases are 4 and 2µm, respectively, 
while the parasitic NPN BJT is also very similar to the 
SCR-buried BJT merely without a floating P+ region in its 
N-well collector and its L value is 1µm. Its N+ anode to P+ 
cathode distance is specifically shorter than the SCR and 
buried-SCR BJT by its nonexistent W value, namely 4µm, in 
addition to the difference between L=1 and 2µm. The 
HVNMOS is the standard high voltage 10V NMOSFET with 
its channel length 2µm, total channel width 80×6µm, drain 
contact to gate spacing 5µm, and source contact to gate spacing 
2µm. We measured the pulse I-V characteristics of these 
devices with a Barth 4002 transmission-line pulse generator 
(TLPG) and DC I-V curves by both HP4156 and Tek 370 
curve tracers. The Human-Body-Model (HBM) ESD data were 
also tested by a wafer-level Thermo KeyTek ZapMaster ESD 
tester. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the typical TLPG I-V curves for all 
devices and a DC I-V curve for the SCR-buried BJT. The SCR 
exhibits the best second breakdown current (It2) value 3.72A. 
The parasitic NPN BJT shows a much lower It2 1.19A. The 
HVNMOS has the worst It2 0.75A. The SCR-buried BJT 
exhibits an excellent It2 2.73A and a quite high AC holding 
voltage. The DC I-V curve for the SCR-buried BJT exhibits an 
even higher DC holding voltage VH 16.5V than the AC holding 
voltage.

BJT, and HVNMOS, in addition to a DC I-V curve for SCR-buried BJT. 
 
Concerning design optimization between latchup 
resistance and ESD robustness, the two major parameters, the 
spacing L and width W, were varied in the device layout 
experiment. We can modify DC holding voltage VH by 
modulating L for the PN diode breakdown. Then we can raise 
the It2 value by enlarging W for decreasing the gradient of 
potential. The resulting electrical characteristics are 
demonstrated in Fig. 2(a) ~ (e) and discussed in the following. 
 
A. I-V characteristics versus spacing L
 
The Effect of the spacing L on It2 per unit total device width 
with W fixed at 4µm is presented in Fig. 2(a). The HVNMOS 
does not possess spacing L type layout. Its data point is put at 
the same place of the SCR just for comparison. The maximum 
It2 is about 65.4A/µm (3.7A). A linear relationship exists 
between the L and It2: It2 (L)=3.6-0.5×L. The It2 level decreases 
with the increase of the L. The plot reveals that the It2 per µm 
at L=0µm is almost the same as that of the SCR. The It2 value 
at L=2µm is also greater than that of the HVNMOS by 31 
times and the NPN BJT by 2.5 times at L=1µm. It is noted that 
the only split condition in the experiment for the parasitic NPN 
is L=1µm, the data of the L = 2µm condition in all the 
following plots were generated by the device simulation. Its N+ 
anode to P+ cathode is longer than the L = 1µm case by an 
additional W value plus the L difference, i.e., 5µm. In other 
words, the simulated L=2µm condition possess the same N+ 
anode to P+ cathode distance as the SCR and buried-SCR BJT 
cases for the purpose of comparison. 
Fig. 2(b) shows the trend of the DC VH and ESD/HBM level 
per unit width with respect to the L. The KV number beside 
each point is its corresponding HBM ESD threshold level. The 
HVNMOS data point is again put at the same place of the SCR 
just for comparison. As the L increases from 0 to 4µm with W 
fixed at 4µm, the VH at RT increases from 2V to 15~18V. The 
VH’s with L>1µm are well above the maximum power supply 
voltage 1.1×Vdd, i.e., 11V for the high voltage 10V technology. 
Even at 85°C the VH’s with L>1µm are around 10V. This 
implies almost latchup-free capability in these devices. The VH 
is strongly controlled by parameter L. Combining Fig. 2(a) and 
(b), the device will consume more power with the larger VH 
and thus it shows lower It2 and can be damaged more easily [6]. 
The key factor that determines the final VH is the 
reverse-biased PN diode. Its breakdown property dominates the 
VH values. As the N-well region of the PN diode becomes

than that of the NPN BJT by more than 80%, and at W=4µm 
higher than that of the HVNMOS by 19 times. This implies 
that the W together with L can be used to optimize the 
electrical characteristics of this SCR-buried device. The VH can 
be raised by the increase of the L. Although the It2 and ESD 
failure threshold will decrease, this can be compensated by 
mere increase of the W. Hence, an efficient ESD protection 
device with high latchup resistance can be achieved by 
optimization of the two layout parameters L and W. 
 
III. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 
We further investigated the operation mechanism by 
numerical simulation. The simulation utilized a two- 
dimensional device simulator Synopsys MEDICI [8] to 
establish the simulation structure and compute the electrical 
and thermal behaviors for the device with L=2µm and W=4µm. 
The detail steps of simulation followed [9]. The investigation 
aims at the holding point behavior. In Fig. 3(a), the large VH in 
(1) is mainly contributed by the reversed voltage bias 18V 
across the N+ anode and the floating P+ diffusion. During pulse 
I-V test mode / ESD transient pulse mode, the reverse PN 
junction can conduct much more displacement current through 
its junction capacitance, thus allows more current contribution 
via the buried-SCR part. This action enables the reduction of 
the voltage drop across the reverse junction diode as well as the 
holding voltage. While during DC I-V test mode this PN 
junction capacitance stays steadily in the off blocking state and 
sustains higher holding voltage accordingly. Therefore, this 
BJT exhibits excellent latchup-prevention capability and also 
quite robust ESD protection level around 7KV. 
At L > 1µm in Fig. 2(b), punchthrough effect cannot 
reach from the floating P+ region to the N+ anode, so that the 
buried SCR could not control the whole voltage drop and the 
reverse-biased N-well / floating P+ anode junction could 
sustain the high holding voltage. On the other hand, for L < 
1µm punchthrough effect penetrates the N- region between the 
N+ anode and floating P+ region. The reverse PN junction could 
not sustain high voltage drop such that the holding voltage is 
mainly determined by the buried SCR. Thus, the holding 
voltages 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3(a) The potential-contour plot of the SCR-buried device. 
around 2V are observed in Fig. 2(b) as well as in Fig. 2(d) for 
L = 1µm. 
In the respect of the W effect on the holding voltage, a 
wider floating P+ region leads to a lower holding voltage. This 
result implies that the wider W results in a larger portion of the 
buried SCR action. This larger P+ region enables a much lower 
series resistance path for the current conduction to give rise to 
a lower holding voltage, otherwise the N- region for the same 
current conduction produces a higher voltage drop as shown in 
Fig. 2(d). 
During the holding condition in Fig. 3(b), a large portion of 
the current flow transports from the N+ anode directly through 
the N-well bottom to the N+ cathode. It also reveals a minor 
part of the current flow is concentrated through the parasitic 
reversed diode at the surface, i.e., through the buried SCR. The 
SEM image at the It2 point is also illustrated in Fig. 3(c). The 
failure spot is majorly located at the N+ anode edge with certain 
extension to the floating P+ area. Therefore, the operation of
