I. 前言、、、、結果與討論（與建議）
The major goal of this project is to study and reduce Curtain Mura (Fig. 1) caused by COG ACF or NCF
process. Because the rigid IC chips of COG ACF or NCF process generate a severe warpage on panel
than TCP package, a display visual defect called Curtain Mura as shown in the following figure will
appear if no proper techniques are developed to avoid its occurrence. When the thickness of the
substrates for TFT-LCD panels reduces for lighter panel, and the shoulder area for drivers shrink for
smaller-size module, it becomes more difficult to prevent the Curtain Mura from occurrence during COG
ACF or NCF process. Recent publication showed the correlation of Curtain Mura with warpage[1] on the
panel caused by the COG ACF process.
However, no Curtain Mura occurred in an empty cell after passing through similar COG ACF process
implying that the Curtain Mura was caused by optical effects of disturbed liquid crystals within the
warpaged panel. For future flexible displays, the reduction of Curtain Mura will be extremely difficult
due to very thin panel composing of plastic substrates or one glass and one flexible substrate.
To understand the root cause of Curtain Mura for its reduction in COG process to increase yield becomes
significant in cost reduction for local panel makers.
II. 研究目的
To understand and eliminate the display visual defect of Curtain Mura occurred during COG ACF or
NCF process from viewpoints of stressed-induced liquid crystal misalignments and stress-induced
cell-gap variations.

V 結果與討論
We have developed simulation methods and experimental methods to investigate the stress-induced Mura
generated by COG ACF process on TFT-LCD panels. Our results indicated the Mura area has variations in
pretilt and twist angles from non-Mura area. The twist angle of Mura area changed from 90 degrees to about
97.07 degrees. The pretilt angle of Mura area decreases from 4.1 degrees to about 3 degrees. Our results
indicated that the cell gap of Mura area did not have detectable change different from the results by previous
publications.

成果所代表之意義、價值、影響或進一步發展之可能性）（以 500 字為限）
In this project, we have carried out both theoretical analysis and experimental measurements to
investigate the phenomena of stress-induced “Curtain Mura”in a COG ACF (or NCF) process.
Such analyses have pointed out suitable routes to identify the variation of LC cell parameters
associated with the occurrences of “Curtain Mura”. In our experiments, we have used
inexpensive dummy TN cells and a home-made COG bonding head to create Mura on the TN
cells. We have used a He:Ne Zeeman laser with orthogonal-polarization outputs and built up
automatic rotation stages and electronics for heterodyne phase detections when the TN samples
were subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane rotations. The data on retardation (in terms of phase
difference) versus out-of-plane rotation can be used to determine the pretilt angle, and versus
in-plane rotation can be used for the determination of cell-gap, and the twist angle. By
comparing the measured cell parameters on the normal areas and compared them to that of Mura
areas, we have obtained the variations in cell parameters in the Curtain-Mura area. Our results
indicated the Mura area has variations in pretilt and twist angles from non-Mura area. The twist
angle of Mura area changed from 90 degrees to about 97.07 degrees. The pretilt angle of Mura
area decreases from 4.1 degrees to about 3 degrees. Our results indicated that the cell gap of
Mura area did change differentiating our results from previous publications.
attendants of this year SID International Conference were only more than 3,000, about
60% level compared to last year SID08 at Los Angeles due to the occurrence of H1n1
flu and the inconvenient location for the Asian attendants. I focused my attention on
the Symposium and Exhibition. For the Symposium, I have attended the Keynote
addresses and a total 11 Technical Sessions:
二、與會心得
On the Keynote address by Dr. In-Jae Chung of LGD on“LCD’s Future
Opportunities with New Applications”.Dr. Chung described Cu-gate and 4-mask
process as two of most important technologies developed by LGD that started to use
them for array production in 2004 at P4 fab and gradually progressed to P8 fab, and
have obtained an accumulated saving of about 700 M $ (USD). Dr. Chung also
mentioned few outstanding products from LGD.
(a) 42”W LCD TV with S-IPS, EEFL, D-IC, high AR and high transmittance...
(b) 15.4”NBPC with reduced PCB size, prism-LGP, micro-lens array and GOP.
(c) 14.1”NBPC with VIC (viewing angle control) by switchable S-IPS mode.
(d) 3D displays, wall displays, flexible displays
(e) Some process of BLU assembly in clean room to reduce particles
(f) Cooperation with glass vendor to reduce particles on glass surface.
On the Keynote address by Yasuhiro Takaki of Tokyo University of Agriculture and
Technology on“Three-dimensional Displays: Present and Future”.
Prof. Takaki emphasized the human-factor aspects of 3D-displays, especially on
visual fatigue and jerky-motion parallax. The following table summarized his view.
Glass-type 3D Glassless 2View Glassless multi-view
Binocular disparity O O O
Convergence O O O
Accommodation X X X
Motion parallax X X fair
Glassless multi-view includes 3D displays by parallax barrier and lenticular lens.
Visual fatigue is caused by conflict between convergence and accommodation. He
also mentioned natural 3D displays by SMV (super multi-view), HDD (high density
directional display), and holography 3D that are free of binocular disparity, motion
parallax, and eye fatigue but it require 1 um pixel pitch. Prof. Takaki also explained
the activities related to international 3D display standards organization such as IEC,
ICDM, and ISO. Some examples are ISO/TC159/SC4 and ISO/TC157/SC4/study
group.
development of blue-phase and PSI mode. I think that Prof. S.–T. Wu, as well as
some of Taiwanese professors are working on this subject. As of today, the
temperature ranges of blue-phase and PSI mixtures are not wide enough and their
Kerr coefficients are not large enough for below 5V operation. However, we have to
watch out when the successful usage of blue-phase or PSI mixtures into TFT-LCD
will occur and becomes the dominant cost differentiator.
The second group is related to fast response using conventional nematic LC
mixtures. This group contains 2 papers: 45.1: Fabrication of Fast Switchable Patterned
Vertical Alignment Mode Using Modified Surface with Reactive Mesogen, and 45.3:
Quasi-impulsive Driving for High-Speed Operation of a Homogeneous Aligned LC Cell
with 3-Electrode Structure. I recommend that most of LC engineers in CMO should
read these two papers carefully. The first paper named as SC (surface controlled)-PVA
mode by SEC to use uv-curing of reactive mesogen (RM) mixed into PI alignment
layer under an applied electric filed on LC cell to create a pretilt angle. To
differentiate with PSA (polymer-stabilized alignment)-MVA mode published by
Fujitsu and AUO. SEC used RMs from Merck and BASF and PI from JSR. The cell
gap was 3 um. Eight domain SC-PVA was demonstrated. SEC claimed that,
concerning the display quality and manufacturability, the superiority sequence could
be expressed as
SC-PVA (both side uv) > PSA-PVA > SC-PVA (single side uv) > PVA.
The second paper used three electrodes (2 Vcom and 1 Vpixel to generate in-plane
and up-down fields for switching on and off for IPS-LCD, respectively. The
gray-to-gray response times of 3-eletrode IPS-LCD were improved quite a lot with a
trade-off of complicated waveforms to drive three electrodes. This paper may be
useful to panel makers in IPS camp.
The third group consists of color e-paper by 5.1: Invited Paper: Development of
E-Paper Color Display Technologies, and 3 cholesteric LCDs papers: 22.1: Novel
Black/White Flexible ChLC Display, 22.2: Frequency Response of Cholesteric LCDs and
Its Application in the Driving System, and 22.3: High Performance Full Color
Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Display with Dual Stacking Structure. The paper of 5.1
offered no new significant information concerning color e-paper technologies. We all
know that there are three ways to make color e-paper: (a) single-layer pixilated
additive color mixing, (b) multi-layer additive color mixing, and (c) multi-layer
subtractive color mixing. Important points are summarized as (1) Pixilated additive
color mixing has a trade off between contrast ratio and color gamut, and high color
gamut can not obtained unless contrast ratio reaches 100:1, (2) Since additive color
mixing systems (RGB or RGBW) are simple by design, and could be mass produced
on short term, this will probably be the first mass-produced color e-paper, (3)
measurements and calculation of 3D properties in the observer space with a very
high angular resolution. The new Fourier optics instrument exhibits a practical
angular resolution better than 0.03° for an aperture angle of 50° and a very low
level of parasitic light. The specific problem of geometric compensation of 3D
displays is examined using multi-locations measurements from different displays.
11.5L: Late-News Paper: Full Resolution Autostereoscopic 3D Display for Mobile
Applications, This paper reported an excellent auto stereo 3D/2D convertible
portable or mobile display for a single user. The novelty was the directional
backlight unit including two-side LED lit LGP and an optical film placed
adjacent to the panel. Right-eye images were provided by right-side LED
synchronized with right-eye images displayed on the panel, and vice versa for the
left-eye images. The panel was operated at 120 Hz to provide 60 Hz images for
each eye in sequence. A 3”prototype of WQVGA (400x240) OCB mode from
TMD was shown at author interview. The prototype showed excellent
autostereo3D images for a single viewer. A companion paper, Poster 190L,
described a new method to measure visual disparity for an auto stereo 3 D display.
It concluded that if the stereo image disparity was kept within 0.5 degrees or
roughly a depth perception of +/- 0.5 inches for the 3”display, the 3D
experiences were excellent. I am fond of the results of this paper. I suggest that
3D engineers in CMO should investigate this paper carefully to see if there is an
opportunity for CMO to get in similar technology. 31.2: Crosstalk-Free 3D Display
with Time-Sequential OCB LCDs, The authors were from TMD. The technology is
rather straightforward if you have TFT-OCB panel technology with blinking
backlight control system. Active glass shutters using OCB mode were
synchronized with display panel with blinking backlights operated at 120 Hz
using time sequential to provide equivalent 60 Hz images for left and right eye,
respectively. The newly developed OCB has a Td+Tr=3 msec and the rise times
from all gray levels to black level are less than 0.26 msec. The blank black
insertion can be applied to the end of each frame of image on panel and on glass
shutters to avoid 3D cross talks. The 15.4”1280RGBx800 3D prototype showed
no 3D cross talks, no pseudoscopy, and no 3D moiré.with wide viewing angles. I
believe that 3D TFT-OCB technology is both high quality and low cost and
suitable for NB 3D/2D convertible displays. 31.3: Reduction and Measurement of
3D Moiré Caused by Lenticular Sheet and Backlight, The paper reported a new
method to measure previous-unknown 3D moiré caused by the interference
between a 3D display’s lenticular sheet and a backlight prism sheet. The thinner
the LCD module is, the more noticeable and unavoidable this 3D moiré becomes.

right eyes receive 60 Hz images.

having a resolution of 1920X1080 and a brightness of 450 nits but 3D images
having a resolution of 1920x540 and a brightness of 200 nits.

digital cinema applications.
There were 5 Exhibitors’Forum Sessions for 5 different technical areas. The most
interesting Session was on Touchscreen Technologies that included 7 different
companies making sequential presentations. Due to schedule conflict, I did not
attend this Session. Dr. Wei Chen of Apple Inc. told me that the most interesting
presentation was by L. Engelhardt of N-trig Ltd. on“Pen, Touch and Multi-Touch
Input: Today and into the Future”.
四、建議
My first recommendation is based on following four presentations related to COG
LCD package technologies:
56.1: A Novel Composite Bump Design for Chip-on-Glass Package Using
Non-Conductive Adhesive Film (Page 834)
Pao-Yun Tang etc (HannStar Display Corporation), Kei-Hsiung Yang (National Chiao Tung University
56.2: Distinguished Student Paper: Effects of Localized Warpage and Stress on
Chip-on-Glass Packaging Induced Light Leakage Phenomenon in 13" TFT-LCD (Page 838)
Chin-Cheng Chang, Jihperng Leu (National Chiao Tung University), Mao-Hsing Lin, Kun-Feng Huang
and 1 paper (by LGD) in Session 58]. Samsung contributed 5 out of a total
10 papers indicating that Samsung has invested heavily on in-cell touch
technologies. I believe that in-cell touch screen products will eventually win
the largest market share among all competing products based on other
touch-input technologies.
