Rashba effects in bulk wurtzite materials 
(manuscript) 
 
Abstract 
The spin-splitting energies in strained bulk wurtzite AlN are studied using the linear combination of 
atomic orbital method. It is found that strain and crystal field induce not only a Rashba linear-k 
( wzα ) but also two Rashba cubic-k terms ( Rγ and Rλ ) in the two-band k ． p

changes to a hexagonal cone, and eventually becomes a hyperboloid of one sheet, due to the 
strain-induced Rashba effect. Such shape-controllable MSS surface makes the [001]-wurtzite 
quantum well also a potential candidate for spintronic devices. 
To calculate the spin-splitting energies in bulk wurtzite, the band structures for both unstrained 
and tensilely biaxial strained wurtzite AlN are computed using the sp3 LCAO method with 
spin-orbital coupling. The Hamiltonian H( k

splitting of anion and cation p states (e.g. ΔN=9 meV and ΔAl=24 meV) in αβSOH  (α, β =↑ or↓ ) has 
been given in Refs. 19 and 20. When crystal field is taken into account, the band structure of the 
unstrained wurtzite is obtained by differentiating the bond in the [001] direction from three other 
bonds.21 The optimized lattice constants and the internal parameter of the unstrained wurtzite AlN 
used in )(0 kH

 are a0 =3.084 Å, c0 =5.362 Å and u0 = 83 .22 On the other hand, the lattice constants 
and the internal parameter u of biaxially strained wurtzite AlN used in )(0 kH
r
 are adopted from 
Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(d) of Ref. 22, respectively. The corresponding LCAO parameters used in these 
strained cases are obtained through Harrison’s 2−d rule23-25 and modification of Slater-Koster 
coefficients26 from those in the ideal wurtzite.18 The spin-splitting energies of the lowest conduction 
band are obtained from the eigenvalues of the above Hamiltonian H( k

(see Fig. 1(a)) instead of the 3//k -dependent behavior in the ideal wurtzite (see the inset of Fig. 1(a) 
in Ref. 9). It is because the crystal field induces both the Rashba linear-k// term ( CRα ) and the Rashba 
cubic-k// term ( CRγ ); however, the latter is diminished by Type-II WBIA term ( 0γ ) with the opposite 
sign. As the tensile strain is applied, the strain-induced Rashba linear-k// term ( SRα ) counteracts the 
crystal-field-induced Rashba linear-k// term ( CRα ), and therefore the value of wzα  is reduced. At 
strain =1.43%, the Rashba linear-k// term just vanishes due to SRα  and CRα  canceling each other, 
which yields the 3//k -dependent behavior in spin splitting (see Fig. 1(b)). When strain >1.43%, the 
interplay between the linear-k// and cubic-k// terms generates the spin-degenerate points on the plane 
of kz = 0.0 (π/c), as shown in Fig. 1(c). 
wzα , wzγ  and wzλ  evaluated from the calculated spin-splitting energies fitting to Eq.(4) 
under various biaxial strains are shown in Fig. 2. Within the first-order approximation, these 
coefficients exhibit linear behaviors under small biaxial strain,

respectively. Both wzα  and wzγ decrease as the tensilely biaxial strain increases, while 
wzλ increase as the tensilely biaxial strain increases. On the other hand, 0γ  is found to remain 
nearly a constant and such variation is due to small change of volume under various strains. Note 
that the values of wzwz γλ vary over a range under various strains and may deviate from that in the 
ideal wurtzite ( 00 γλ ≈ 4),9 since it is related to the curvature of the MSS surface (i.e.,

where Eα  is the electric-field-induced Rashba effect, and kz is replaced by 〈 kz2 〉  considering the 
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface. Theoretically, a spin-degenerate Fermi 
surface can be achieved by proper adjustment of the variables in the above equation, and Ref. 9 has 
discussed the importance of the Type-II WBIA term (corresponding to 0γ ) on this subject. 
Experimentally, phenomena related to the spin-degenerate Fermi surface have been partly observed 
by Tsubaki et al.30 via varying gate voltage (corresponding to Eα ), and by Lo et al.31 via varying 
carrier concentration (corresponding to k//), independently in 2DEGs of GaN/AlGaN wurtzite 
heterostructures. However, experimental results related to the influence of strain (corresponding to 
wzα , Rγ , and Rλ ) on the spin-degenerate Fermi surface in wurtzite materials have rarely been 
reported. Since strain is one of the crucial variables that can be adjusted during semiconductor 
manufacturing process to manipulate device characteristics, further experimental results related to 
the spin-degenerate Fermi surface are expected on this factor, whose importance has been 
illustrated in this report. Thorough understanding of this issue can be a significant key to the 
successful development of spin electronic devices. 
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that crystal field and biaxial strain induce not only a 
Rashba linear-k but also two Rashba cubic-k terms in the two-band k．p Hamiltonian. Besides, we 
have also illustrated that the MSS surface with the shape of a hexagonal hyperboloid of two sheets 
exists in the unstrained bulk wurtzite AlN, due to the crystal-field-induced the Rashba effect. As 
tensilely biaxial strain increases, the shape of the MSS surface changes to a hexagonal cone, and 
eventually becomes a hyperboloid of one sheet, due to the strain-induced the Rashba effect. These 
results indicate the shape of the MSS surface can be altered by crystal field or strain through the 
interplay between these Rashba linear-k and cubic-k terms.
