reduced, a phenomenon that is crucial to improving computer mechanics. However, this continuous 
size reduction cannot continue for long. Transistors that are too small restrict the overall functionality 
of a computer. Hence, in 1982, Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman [39] proposed the 
concept of the quantum computer, which exploits the quantum features such as superposition and 
entanglement. 
The most basic structural element of a traditional computer, the bit, can exist in only one of two 
mutually exclusive states, 0 or 1. However, this rule does not apply in Feynman’s proposed quantum 
computer. A quantum bit can exist not only in the traditional 0 or 1 state, but also in continuous or 
overlapping states. A quantum bit that is in continuous or overlapping states can be recognized to be in 
two domains, namely 0 and 1. However, the operations based on such a quantum bit affects the two 
values simultaneously, as revealed in Fig. 1. Therefore, operating on a single quantum bit implies 
working on two values. Similarly, a bi-quantum bit system can work on four values, and a tri-quantum 
bit system can operate on eight values. Accordingly, as the number of quantum bits rises, the quantum 
collateral effect obtained from the system is increased by the exponential method. 
 
Figure 1: State of quantum bit cache 
Although the concept of quantum computers has remained purely theoretical for a long time, 
recent developments in quantum computers have aroused interest. Shor et al. [38] designed an 
algorithm that successfully calculated a large amount of data using quantum computers. A quantum 
computer can utilize this algorithm as a solution to problems based on exponential operations, such as 
the NP problem [44, 45] or factorization [16]. The temporal cost is much less than that of any 
conventional computer. Therefore, quantum computer is now increasingly studied with many 
researchers attempting to produce a practical quantum computer. 
1.2. Origin of quantum cryptographic system 
While most current cryptographic technologies, such as RSA, DES, ECC and others are based on 
factorization, discrete logarithms, and other exponential operations, Shor's algorithm [38] for a 
quantum computer can efficiently solve the exponential equation problems. Thus, currently available 
cryptosystems will in comparison become useless and lacking in security [17, 20, 28] when quantum 
computers become practical reality. Most public key cryptosystems apply simple mathematics that can 
be hacked easily by scanning for loopholes and backdoors. This weakness is the limitation of modern 
cryptography. Accordingly, developing an entirely new cryptosystem has become the research goal in 
various fields [9, 34]. The quantum cryptosystem is one such system. 
Wiesner [42] proposed the one-time pad method for key distributions, exploiting the laws of 
physics to scan for system intrusion or wiretap in the 1970s. A wiretap was identified from an altered 
quantum state. Quantum mechanics does not regard measurement as an external and passive process,

specific methods for key distribution under various attacks. 
Lutkenhaus [37] was one of the first to examine the security of quantum cryptosystems. Biham 
and Mor [24, 25] presented a method of resolving collective attack. Mayers [21], Yao [2] and Mayers 
and Salvail [22] based their research on BB84 Protocol [11], believing that this method could provide 
unconditional security and resist various attacks. Bennett et al. examined the security of even-odd bits 
of quantum cryptography [13]. 
After 20 years of development of QKDPs, a group of scholars asserted that although quantum 
cryptosystem based on the QKDP can achieve unconditional security, its key generation is not 
efficient in practice because the qubits transmitted in the quantum channel cannot be completely 
employed. For instance, out of 10 qubits, only 5 qubits are used for key generation. Additionally, its 
key distribution applies one-time pad method, and the length of the key must be the same as that of 
the plaintext, so the number of qubits required far exceeds the length of plaintext. Therefore, the cost 
of frequent transmission of bulk messages is much too high. Consequently, the idea of Quantum 
Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) is proposed. It transforms plaintext to qubits to replace the key, 
and transmits the messages via the quantum channel. This reduces the number of qubits used, thus 
enables automatic detection of eavesdroppers. 
QSDC Protocol was initialized by Beige et al. in 2002 [1]. In the scheme, the secure message 
comprises a single photon with two qubit states; it becomes read-only after a transmission of an extra 
classical message via a public channel for each qubit. Boström and Felbingeer later developed a 
Ping-Pong QSDC Protocol [33] that adopts the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs [3] as the 
quantum information carriers. In the protocol, the secure messages are decoded during transmission, 
and no additional information needs to be transmitted. Deng et al. in 2004 proposed a QSDC scheme 
using batches of single photons that act as a one-time pad [26]. Lucamarini and Mancini presented a 
protocol [36] for deterministic communication without applying entanglement in 2005. J. Wang et al. 
proposed a QSDC approach that employs single photons, of which the concepts were resulted from 
the order rearrangement and the block transmission of the photons [32]. 
3. Two principles used in QKDPs 
The Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the Bell's Inequality are the two main theorems 
utilized in the development of QKDPs, and are still widely applied today. Their basic principles and 
their role in the design of the QKDPs are explained below. 
3.1. The QKDPs based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle 
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that two complementary quantum states cannot be 
simultaneously measured. Heisenberg discovered this principle when he was performing a light 
diffraction experiment. He noted the decoherence of wave function of the system while measuring the 
position of photons. A shorter wavelength corresponds to a more precise position of the photons; as 
the wavelength rises, disturbances increase, and the position of the photons becomes imprecise and 
uncertain. Hence, the simultaneous measurements of two complementary quantum states are 
imprecise, and they alter the system. The new state differs from that before the measurement. 
The security of early QKDPs is mainly based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. An 
eavesdropper attempting to tap into a system to hack secret information needs to measure the quantum 
state. However, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the measurement of a quantum system 
affects the entire system. Consequently, the legitimate users can monitor any change to determine the 
presence of an eavesdropper or a wiretap.

The polarized photons are usually used to denote the individual bits, 0 and 1, in the classical

reason is that if Alice and Bob are adopting the same orthogonal bases and eavesdropper Eve is 
coincidentally also applying the same basis, not only can she perfectly obtain all information 
transmitted by Alice, but she can also remain undetected. Such a cryptosystem is thus easily hacked. 
When the type of polarized photon used each time by Alice for transmission is unknown, the 
receiver Bob also randomly selects an orthogonal base measurement instrument, e.g., rectilinear-basis 
or diagonal-basis, to measure the photon's polarization. 
【Step 2: Generating the source session key via the open channel】 
On receiving the photon transmitted by Alice, Bob informs her via public channels of the basis 
used to accept each bit that was transmitted. Thereafter, Alice informs Bob, which bits were applied 
the correct basis and which ones weren’t. They then discard the incorrect ones and use the remaining 
to form the original session key. 
【Step 3: Detecting the eavesdroppers on the open channel】 
Alice and Bob are both in the open transmission. Together, they select a part of the source session 
key for comparison. When only one photon is used for comparison, then under the two conditions 
stated below, an eavesdropper can disable the two communicating parties from detecting intrusion. 
The first condition is that the eavesdropper and Bob choose the same basis, which also happens to 
match the polarization of the photon sent by Alice. Since the photon finally received by Bob is the 
same as that originally transmitted by Alice, the presence of the eavesdropper cannot be determined, 
as displayed in Fig. 6(a). The second condition is that the basis selected by the eavesdropper is 
different from that chosen by Bob, but the basis chosen by Bob matches the polarization of the photon 
transmitted by Alice. Though the eavesdropper changes the original polarization of the photon owing 
to the mismatched basis, there is still a 1/2 probability that the polarization of photon may be changed 
back to the original because the basis applied by Bob matches the original photon. Thus, the presence 
of the eavesdropper cannot be determined. Similarly, if Bob does not change the polarization of the 
photon back to its original, then the eavesdropper's presence will be detected, for the state of the 
photon has changed, as illustrated as Figs. 6(b) and 6(c). Hence, the probability of not detecting the 
presence of the eavesdropper is 1/2 + (1/2)*(1/2) = 3/4. If two photons are adopted, then the 
probability is (3/4)2. Therefore, the probability of undetected eavesdropping in case of n photons is 
(3/4)n. Restated, the probability that eavesdropping fails is 1−(3/4)n. If n is a very large integer, then 
the probability almost equals 1. Hence, if an eavesdropper is present, then the probability of the two 
communicating parties detecting the intrusion is close to 100% for a large integer n.

4.1.3. B92 Protocol 
B92 Protocol is another QKDP that uses the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. This protocol is 
similar to the BB84 System except that the polarization is employed to transmit the photons and its 
bases are of non-perpendicular form, explained as follows.  
The sender Alice chooses either rectilinearly or diagonally polarized photons to represent the 
binary bits 0 and 1. For example, the rectilinear polarization |→〉 indicates the bit 0, and the diagonal 
polarization |↗〉 denotes the bit 1. 
Similarly, the receiver Bob also selects one of the two non-perpendicular bases to perform the 
measurements, but note that it must be different from the photon polarization chosen by Alice. 
Therefore, if Alice selects |→〉 and |↗〉 as the polarization of the photon, then the polarization of the 
photon used by Bob is |↖〉 and |↑〉. Accordingly, |↖〉 is used to accept |→〉 which denotes 0, and |↑〉 
for |↗〉 which denotes 1. 
Table 2: Four groups of polarized photons for denoting binary bits in B92 Protocol 
User    Bits 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 
Sender |→〉 |↗〉 |↑〉 |↗〉 |→〉 |↖〉 |↑〉 |↖〉 
Receiver |↖〉 |↑〉 |↖〉 |→〉 |↗〉 |↑〉 |↗〉 |→〉 
As noted in Section 4.1.1, measuring a rectilinearly polarized photon with regard to the diagonal 
can cause all information about the rectilinear polarization of the photon to be lost. That is, if |↖〉 is 
used to receive |→〉, then |↖〉 or |↗〉 have an equal chance of occurring; thus, there is only 50% 
chance of correctly obtaining |↖〉 which denotes the 0 bit. Similarly, the chance that |↑〉 can correctly 
produce |↗〉 is also only 50%. Furthermore, because the photon polarization appears to be 
perpendicular to the basis, the basis cannot detect the presence of photons. Hence, the chance that the 
photons are correctly obtained when applying |↖〉 to obtain |↗〉 or |↑〉 to obtain |→〉 is 0%. Therefore, 
in the case of only one photon, the possibility that B92 can correctly detect and obtain the photon is 
only 25%, as demonstrated in Figs. 9 and 10.

where the photons could not be received is not addressed in this study. 
 
Figure 11: The measurement outcomes while the eavesdroppers are present 
Furthermore, because interference easily affects light, a key may include erroneous codes created 
in a noise-congested environment by instruments and other factors. Therefore, the two communicating 
parties can set an acceptable error rate of R. If R exceeds the limit RMax, then the probability of a 
wiretap being present exceeds the probability that noise caused the error. Therefore, Alice and Bob 
return to the procedure in Step 1; otherwise, they move on to the next step. 
【Step 4: Obtaining the final session key via the open channel】 
This procedure is similar to that of Step 4 in BB84 discussed previously. 
Figure 12 illustrates the state of B92 key distribution when no wiretap is present. In this state, the 
sender and the receiver obtain the source key string after the undetected qubits (represented as NG) 
have been discarded. 
Figure 13 indicates how the presence of eavesdroppers causes the quantum states to be changed. 
Based on the state of the first received qubit, if no eavesdropper exists, then such a qubit should not be 
detected, and should thus be treated as undetected. Nevertheless, the eavesdropper intrudes using a 
different basis from Bob, and the state of this qubit changes. Thus, Bob shall detect the qubit. This 
violates the originally expected result. So, Bob shall then become aware of the possible existence of 
an eavesdropper. Additionally, the green arrow appearing in the second and sixth qubit demonstrates 
that this photon (qubit) can not be detected because its polarization is changed and not equal to the 
polarization of the measuring instrument.

Similarly, if photon 1 is obtained in |↑〉, then photon 2 will also be obtained in |↑〉. For instance, the 
photon 1 received by Alice can be either 0 (|→〉) or 1 (|↑〉). The measurement outcome of the photon 
made by Alice is completely random, and thus each possible outcome has a probability of 1/2. By 
contrast, the measurement outcome is not randomly executed by Bob; rather, it is the same as that 
performed by Alice. Even if Alice and Bob received the photons at the same time, they shall still 
achieve the same outcome. Therefore, the two photons can be said to be correlated through the 
apparently random outcomes, as shown in Fig. 14. 
 
Figure 14: States of receiving the entangled photons for Alice and Bob 
Consider the case where Alice and Bob randomly select dissimilar bases to measure the photons. 
For example, Alice chooses two different bases, a1 and a2, and Bob chooses b1 and b2. E(a, b) 
denotes that Alice uses the basis a and Bob uses the basis b. We will see that, if a1, a2, b1, and b2 
were suitably chosen, then the outcomes of the experiment always violate the following inequality [4].

To the Bell state of |Φ+〉, the right hand side of the inequality can unexpectedly reach 22 , which 
is greater than 2. There are three other states of two qubits that lead to this maximal value of 22 . 
The states, |Φ+〉, |Φ–〉, |Ψ+〉, and |Ψ–〉, are known as the Bell states, as shown below and in Fig. 15.

channel remained stable [40] even with lengthy transmission. Japan's NEC utilized flat Planar 
Lightwave Circuit (PLC) technology and a low-noise photon receiver to stretch the key transmission 
length to over 100km. A transmission length of 150 km was reached in 2004, [30], indicating that 
quantum cryptosystem has considerable potential both in theory and in practice. Quantum 
cryptosystems are expected to cause a strong influence over our daily lives in future in the following 
three areas. 
First, a quantum cryptosystem can be used to design smart cards. Its quantum attributes can be 
applied to authenticate IDs, withdrawals, deposits and transfers, and medical IC smart cards. The 
quantum cryptosystem can improve the security of smart cards, and the quantum technology in the 
smart card removes the requirement for calculations. Therefore, no processor will be required, and the 
manufacturing cost is decreased. 
Second, the integration of a quantum cryptosystem into modern electronics depends on physics 
and technology, for instance, analyzing system entities such as particles, atoms, photons and electrons 
[27]. This characteristic may be considered a new direction in information processing, and it may 
open up a new technological avenue based on fundamental particle science. 
Finally, a quantum cryptosystem can be employed to develop a strong information security 
software system [5, 19, 35]. This system can improve e-commerce technology [14, 6] for units that 
depend on high security, for instance, national defense, and it can support national economies and 
promote development of high technology. 
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the validity and potential benefits of quantum cryptology.

Abstract. This study presents an approach to improving the (t, n) ring signature, which permits a signer to sign anonymously.  Using 
fair partitioning to design a new (t, n) threshold ring signature based on bilinear pairing, the study develops a threshold signature method. 
The proposed method not only permits total signer anonymity, but also resist the signature of an anonymous signer from being forged 
even in a random oracle mode. Besides, the method is competent for protecting the identity and signature of a signer in regard to the 
anonymity property of ring signature. Therefore, this method trends suitable for those application complex, such as electronic voting and 
electronic cash, as well as for democratic management in which members with specific threshold value voice their opinion. 
Keywords. Ring signature, fair partitioning, threshold signature, bilinear pairing, and anonymity. 
1 Introduction 
The ring signature scheme [3] was developed by R. Rivest et al. in 2001. This scheme was created from the concept of 
“How to leak a secret;” it was a special group signature that did not require the creation of a group; in spite of the 
management of an administrator; a signer only required randomly choosing a portion of the public keys of members and 
then creating a ring signature through his private key.  Such a signature method significantly lowered the complexity of 
the mutual authentication process, to achieve the greatest advantage that allows then signer to remain anonymity thus to 
protect the privacy of a signer. 
The threshold signature method [6] was first introduced by Y. Desmedt and Y. Franke in 1991. A threshold signature 
enables a group to share signing power with other members. It is the most commonly employed cipher element in group 
security. 
Some contexts, such as multi-user electronic shares, multi-user united elections and employee opinion survey, require 
the sharing of signing power in consideration of protecting the signer's identity. The threshold ring signature scheme was 
developed to meet both these requirements, and it is one of the recent hot research topics. 
Bresson, Stern and Szydlo constructed a threshold ring signature scheme [8] based on the ring signature scheme [3] by 
Rivest et al. in 2002, and demonstrated that their method is secure using the random oracle mode. In the method, the 
verifier could confirm that in an n-member group, at least k members had signed the message, but which k members had 
signed the message could not specifically known. H. Kuwakado and H. Tanaka presented a (k, n) threshold ring signature

the message m and L using the originally provided system parameter, as shown below. The values of zj corresponding to Pj 
are obtained by verifying signatures, where j = 0, 1,..., n-1. 
【Simplified signature algorithm】 
for i = 0, 1,..., n-1 do 
Step 1: Calculate zi = gXk(i) mod p and ci = H( L || m || gi
α(i) mod pi || gα(i) mod p), where L is the public key list, α(i)
←{0,..., 2u - 1}, u is a security parameter 
Step 2: Calculate si = α(i) - Xk(i) ci (∈Z) 
Step 3: Send m, L, and (zi, ci, si) 
end 
【Verification of simplified signature algorithm】 
Render m, L, and (zi, ci, si), where i = 0, 1,..., n - 1 
for i = 0, 1,..., n - 1 do 
Calculate di = H( L || m || gi
si yi
ci mod pi || gsi zi
ci mod p) 
If ci = di, then zi corresponds to yi and zi is generated due to zi = gXk(i) using the private key Xk(i) of Pi 
end 
【Analysis of simplified signature algorithm】 
Owing to ci = H( L || m || gi
α(i) mod pi || gα(i) mod p) and si = α(i) - Xk(i) ci, so α(i) = si + Xk(i) ci can be obtained via a 
swapping equation 
Then H( L || m || gi
α(i) mod pi || gα(i) mod p) = H( L || m || gi
si yi
ci mod pi || gsi zi
ci mod p) 
Because di = H( L || m || gi
si yi
ci mod pi || gsi zi
ci mod p)  
Therefore ci = di 
According to the above, it can be shown that the simplified signature algorithm is correct. 
This simplified signature algorithm is clearly degraded from the (t, n) threshold ring signature such that only a 
one-member group exists. The threshold ring signature does not satisfy anonymity, because a person in P = {P1,..., Pn} who 
does not participate in the (t, n) ring signature can generate a simplified signature, which can be demonstrated through 
verification not to match any of the sub-ring signatures, which proves that the signer has not participated in the ring 
signature. Thus, any member of the group not participating in the ring signature can perform the above action to shake off 
suspicion; however, a participant in a ring signature cannot do so, making the identity of the (t, n) ring signature 
participants very easy to determine. Even if the t members refuse to create simplified signatures, their identities can be 
determined through other members with simplified signatures. 
3 Proposed Identity-based threshold ring signature scheme 
To raise system efficiency, simplify key management process, and combine the threshold ring signature [8] in Ad-hoc 
group, this study proposes an ID-based threshold ring signature scheme. The process comprises four steps, namely setup, 
fair partitioning, signing, and verification. The participants are the TA, signer, and verifier.  
3.1 Setup 
First, let G be Gap Diffile-Hellman (GDH) with order q, e: G × G → V be bilinear pairings, and P be the generator of G. 
Next, the TA randomly selects as MASTER-KEY, calculates Ppub = sP, and defines two hash functions H:{0, 1}*→Z/q and

end 
Step 3: Use the gap value obtained in the previous step to calculate super-ring )(  ,}1 ,0{ 1 ssitRs Fu σσ ←⎯⎯← +

ui←F (ui-1♁(   || ... ||     ))

Step 4: Seal the super-ring, and calculate the gap value of sub-ring

Step 5: Find the solution to the sub-ring of the fair partition  
for k = 1, 2,..., t do  
Let the correct thk  sub-ring of fair partition ( )tssss ππππ ,...,, 21=  be Rsk ={Psk1, Psk2,..., Pskw}; its 
corresponding identity list is Ls
k = {IDsk1, IDsk2,..., IDskw}. Suppose that Rs
k∩P = {Psks}, then the sub-ring 
signature can be determined through Psks and the private key SIDsks. The signer randomly selects Ak∈R G,

4.2 Unforgeability 
The theorem and proof for satisfying the unforgeablity feature are as follows. 
【Theorem 1】 Under the random oracle mode and the hardness of assumptions of the CDHP (the hardness 
assumption of computational Diffie-Hellman problem), ECDLP, and BPIP, the ID-based (t, n) threshold ring signature 
method can withstand a compatibility chosen message attack.  
【Proof】 First, define qH, qG, and qS which denote the request number of the oracle systems H and G and the 
signature oracle system S, respectively.  Next, prove that a certain valid signature is commonly generated by 
multi-members, and the number of participant members is greater than or equal to the agreed number, t.  Then, an 
attacker A might take a compatibility-chosen message attack and might have a success probability of .ε   Compared with 
another attacker B, who attacks the unidirectional nature of the expanded bilinear pairings function, the result can be 
proven as follows, where )(ASucccmasign  denotes the success attack probability of A and )(BSucc

Let ,log2  and  log n

Next, B randomly selects a pointer ],1[0 ni ∈  and a subset ],1[0 nI ⊂ , where the base of 0I  is 1−t  also satisfies 
.00 Ii ∉   Attacker B might guess and expect that the subset 0I  contains bribed members. B  sets the public key of 0iP  
as )( 010 IDHQID =  using 1−t  pairs of the paired public and private keys of all members in ,0I  and B  randomly 
selects the public keys for other members, without using the corresponding private keys.  Then, B  randomly selects an 
integer 0t  from ], ,1[ t  two integers 0h  and '0h  from ], ,1[ qH  and two integers 0g  and '0g  from ], ,1[ qG  all of 
which satisfy ,'' 0000 hhgg <<<  and qH  and qG  denote the attack process in which A  sends requests to the oracle 
systems H  and .G   Finally, A  performs initialization through the random coin tossing method, in which employs all 
public keys as input. 
B  imitates the random oracle systems H  and ,G  uses a random value as the respondence to the request proposed 
by ,A   and stores the requests in a list.  Let 0Γ  denote the difference value generated by the request 0g  and ;'0g  let 
0γ  denote the sub-chain between 1)1(0 0][ +−Γ tl  and 0 0 ][ tlΓ  generated by .0Γ   If H-request '0h  satisfies ,0 ni <  then 
B  replies with );  ),(  ( /

);  ),(   )   (( / 0100 pubPIDHrxey ⊕  where 0x  denotes the response to request .0h  
A  can employ his compatibility method to send the private key requests to 1−t  participants.  B  uses the direct 
method to respond to the request from A  unless the private key of participant jP  does not belong to ;0I  in this case, 
B  stops functioning and outputs an output failed message.  B  can correctly guess that the probability of corrupt 
members in subset 0I  is at least .1

Finally, B  signs by imitating a signature oracle, and therefore can imitate the signing process of any sub-group of 
participants.  The imitation is achieved simultaneously by randomly selecting signature construction processes, and 
appropriately responding to G-request and H-request (a successful imitation of oracle G  and H ). 
At the same time, attacker A  outputs a t -forged signature with a probability of ε  which is forging a valid 
signature generated by t  members.  The forged signature is ).) , , , , ,(  ,  ,  ,  ,(

4.4 Efficiency analysis 
The fundamental operation in this method is to calculate the bilinear pairing. The time complexity of the threshold ring 
signature algorithm based on secret sharing is O(n2) [8], while the proposed scheme uses the super-ring method and fair 
partition methods, and has a time complexity of O(nlogn). Clearly, the efficiency of the proposed scheme is significantly 
increased. 
5 Conclusions 
This study presents a new threshold ring signature scheme in terms of identity authentication, with proof against total 
security in random oracle mode. Through the application of fair partitioning to design a (t, n) threshold ring signature on 
bilinear pairing, the anonymity of signer can be achieved, and the potential forgery attack of signature resisted. Having got 
the characteristics established, the practicability of the method can be fulfilled to complex application, including electronic 
transaction, or the democratic management system.
