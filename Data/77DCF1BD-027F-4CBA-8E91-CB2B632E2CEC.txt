Abstract
We propose several regression-based procedures for building confidence
interval estimators of steady-state parameters in discrete event simulations
and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. In this project, we
will explore the theoretical properties of these procedures and test their
empirical performance on various classical problems in discrete event and
MCMC simulations. These procedures can be implemented on parallel
processors or single processor architecture.
Keywords: Regression, discrete event simulation, steady-state simu-
lation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo

The steady-state simulation problem is a very important topic in simu-
lation. It has been studied for a long time and is continue to be a hot
research topic; see Law and Kelton (2000), Bratley et al. (1983), Banks
et al. (2000), Meketon and Heidelberger (1982) Cash et al. (1992), Glynn
(1995), Goldsman et al. (1994), Schruben (1982), Schruben et al. (1983),
K. Preston White (1997), and Jr. et al. (2000), Hsieh et al. (2004), and
Steiger et al. (2005).
We start with a justification of (2). It is typically the case that when
(1) holds, there exists a random variable (rv) Y (∞) for which
Y (t)⇒ Y (∞) (4)
as t → ∞, where α = EY (∞). (For example, (4) holds when Y is a
positive recurrent regenerative process having a spread-out cycle-length
distribution; see ?, p. 351). In the presence of uniform integrability,
a(t)
△
= EY (t)− α→ 0
as t→∞. The representation (2) then hinges on the question of how fast
a(t) converges to zero as t→∞.
Proposition 1.1 If a(t) = o(t−p) as t → ∞ for p > 1 and a(·) is a
bounded function, then
EY¯ (t) = α+

as t → ∞, where k = ⌊p⌋ and 0 = b2 = b3 = · · ·. If a(t) = o(exp(−rt))
as t → ∞ for r > 0 and a(·) is a bounded function, then EY¯ (t) = α +
o(exp(−rt)) as t→∞.

where 0 < t1 < · · · < tm = t. The minimizer αˆ1 = αˆ1(t) of (8) is given
by
αˆ1(t) =

Put si = ti/t and s0 = 0. For m = 2, αˆ1(t) simplifies to
αˆ1(t) =
Y¯ (t)− s1Y¯ (s1t)

so that αˆ1(t) corresponds then to the time-average obtained when the first
interval [0, t1] of observations is deleted from the sample. Furthermore, in
the presence of (7),
E(αˆ1(t)− α)2
E(Y¯ (t)− α)2 →
1
1− s1
as t→∞, establishing that αˆ1(t) is inferior (in terms of mean square error
(MSE)) to the time-average Y¯ (t) when t is large.
For m = 3 and s1 = 1/3, s2 = 1/3, and s3 = 1,

Here, αˆ1(t) deletes the initial interval [0, t/3] but weights observations
from two subsequent intervals [t/3, 2t/3] and [2t/3, t] unequally. Also

establishing again that the original time-average estimator Y¯ (t) is prefer-

For general values of m, the following result provides an exact expres-
sion for the limiting ratio of the MSE of αˆ1(t) to that of Y¯ (t).

4 Numerical examples
In this section, we present computational results which illustrate the theo-
retical properties of the regression based estimators mentioned above. We
start with a description of the (three) stochastic processes and associated
paramaters.
The first stochastic process is the waiting time process in the M/M/1
queue with server utilization ρ = 0.9, service rate µ = 1, and an empty-
and-idle initial condition.
We next turn to review the specific estimators for α that we shall
consider in this paper. Given a realization of Y up to time t, our first
steady-state estimator is the time average estimator
Y¯ (t) ≡ 1
t
∫ t
0
Y (s)ds
Given selection of time points t1 < · · · < tm = t, our regression based
estimators are all linear combinations of Y¯ (ti)’s.
Let T denote matrix transpostion and set
Y¯ = (Y¯ (t1), Y¯ (t2), . . . , Y¯ (tm))
T , A =


1 1/t1
1 1/t2
...
...
1 1/tm

 , and θ =
(
α
b
)
.
Then the ordinary least square problem (8) can be rewritten as
min
θ
(Y¯ − Aθ)T (Y¯ −Aθ) (12)
It is well known that the solution θ∗ to (12) must satisfy the normal
equation (Golub and Van Loan, 1996, p. 238):
(ATA)θ∗ = AT Y¯ (13)
It is clear that A has full rank, thus θ∗ = (ATA)−1AT Y¯ . Our first
regression-based estimator α1(t) is therefore just the first element of θ
∗,
i.e. θ∗(1).
Let Σ be the covariance matrix of Y¯ . We have shown that, when Σ is
assumed to be the asymptotic matrix obtained from (7), the estimators
based on the ideas of generalized least squares and best unbiased linear
estimator lead to the same standard truncated time-average estimator
αˆ2(t) (equation (??)). However, we are also interested in investigating the

tions.

312500 0.0393 0.0648 0.0592 1.6476 1.5058
Multiplying both sides by AT , we find that
e = Aw∗ = ATΣ−1Aλ
Now using the fact A has full rank, we can invert ATΣ−1A and write
λ = (ATΣ−1A)−1e
Next using above equation and (17) to obatin
w∗ = Σ−1A(ATΣ−1A)−1e
It follows that, when Cˆ is used in place of Σ, the best linear unbiased
estimator for α is
(w∗)T Y¯ = (Cˆ−1A(AT Cˆ−1A)−1e)T Y¯ = eT (AT Cˆ−1A)−1AT Cˆ−1Y¯ ,
which is just α3(t).
Our first set of numerical experiments produce Y¯ (t), αˆ1(t), and αˆ2(t)
from single replication of Y up to time t. W e use a simple rule to select
time points selection. In particular, we select batch size and the number
of time points m and set ti = i× batch size.
The results of this project is a joint work with Professor Glynn at
Stanford University. We will submit the results of this project to a suitable
journal for publication in the near future.

ABSTRACT
Equity Indexed Annuities (EIAs) are popular insurance con-
tracts. EIAs provide the insured with a guaranteed accu-
mulation rate on their premium at maturity. In addition,
the insured may receive extra benefit if the return of the
linked index is high enough. There are a few variations of
EIAs. We consider two types of EIAs: compound ratchet
and simple ratchet. Under the geometric Brownian motion
assumption for the equity index, plain compound ratchet
options is known to have closed form solutions, but plain
simple ratchet option is not. In this paper, we derive a
closed form solution for plain simple ratchet option. For
more exotic options, Monte Carlo methods are usually used
for their valuation. To improve their efficiency, we propose
two control variates based on the analytical solutions for the
price of plain ratchet options. The effectiveness of the pro-
posed control variates is examined via numerical examples
of a typical contract.
1 INTRODUCTION
An Equity Indexed Annuity contract provides the policy-
holder with a guaranteed minimum annual return and offers
participation in the equity market. The returns to be credited
are based on the index-linked return, which is tied to the
performance of an equity price index such as the Standard
and Poor’s 500, the participation rate and the guaranteed
minimum return. The participation rate determines how
much of the index increases will be used to compute the
index-linked return. With the guaranteed minimum return,
the downside risk of the equity market is limited. EIAs
usually have a maturity ranging from one to ten years, with
seven years being typical.
There exists a few variations of EIA contracts. The
major contract types include point-to-point (PTP), ratchet
(which comes in simple and compound versions), and high
water mark; see Hardy (2003) for more information. The
ways to calculate the index-linked return is usually called

indexation method or indexing. For PTP EIAs, the indexing
is based on the growth of the two time points, which is
the simplest indexation method. High water mark EIAs
have the feature similar to a lookback option. They choose
the maximum index level over the entire term of an an-
nuity for calculating payoff at maturity. Under the ratchet
contract design, the indexing is usually evaluated annually
based on the index growth during each time period. With
a compound ratchet (CR), the returns in each time period
are compounded, while the returns of each period of a sim-
ple ratchet (SR) are summed arithmetically. These types of
contracts are more popular than the traditional life insurance
products. Hence, their fair value and hedging strategies are
crucial for life insurance companys. The valuation meth-
ods of EIAs has been discussed in a few papers: Tiong
(2000) valued a contract slightly different to the usual con-
tract design under the assumptions within the Black-Scholes
framework. Lee (2003) used the method of Esscher trans-
forms (similar to exponential twisted change-of-measures)
to derive the explicit pricing formulas for four types of
EIAs embedded with path-dependent options. The effects
of stochastic interest rates and mortality were explored in
Lin and Tan (2003).
In this paper, we focus on valuation methods for ratchet
EIA contracts. In particular, we will discuss valuation
methods for the following 4 types of ratchet EIA contracts.
For most ratchet EIAs, the index participation is evaluated
annually. To simplify the presentation, we assume this
convention.
Let T be the maturity of a ratchet EIA contract and
S(t) be the linked-index at time t ≤ T . We set
Rt =
S(t)
S(t−1) , t = 1, . . . ,T, (1)
which are the annual returns of linked-index. The effective
annual returns of the EIA contract are defined as
R˜t = 1+min(max(α(Rt −1), f ),c) (2)
Hsieh and Chiu
where φ(·) and Φ(·) are the density function and the cu-
mulative distribution function of standard normal random
variable, respectively.are independent normal random variables with parameters
r−d−σ2/2 and σ2 (Hull 2006). Now using (2) we can
get
R˜t = (1−α)+αmin(max( fα ,Rt),cα), (12)
where fα = 1+ f/α and cα = 1+ c/α . Set
Xt =min(max( fα ,Rt),cα). (13)
Then it is easy to see that Xt ’s are independent censored
lognormal random variables with censored values fα and cα .
We use (3) and (8) to obtain
Vcr = E[e−rT
T
∏
t=1
(1−α+αXt)]
= e−rT (1−α+αEX1)T , (14)
and use (4) and (9) to obtain
Vsr = E[e−rT (1−T +
T
∑
t=1
R˜t)]
= e−rT [(1−αT )+αTEX1]. (15)
Therefore, we just need the explicit formula of EX1 to derive
the explicit formulas for Vcr and Vsr.
To compute EX1, we first write
EX1 = fαP(R1≤ fα)+E[R1; fα ≤R1≤ cα ]+cαP(R1≥ cα).
Then, by representing R1 as er−d−σ
2/2+σN(0,1) and letting
d1 =
log fα − r+d
σ
+
σ
2
, (16)
and
d2 =
logcα − r+d
σ
+
σ
2
, (17)
we obtain
P(R1 ≤ fα) = P(N(0,1)≤ d1) =Φ(d1),
P(R1 ≥ cα) = P(N(0,1)≥ d2) =Φ(−d2),
and
E[R1; fα ≤ R1 ≤ cα ] =
∫ d2
d1
er−d−σ
2/2+σzφ(z)dz
= er−d [Φ(d2−σ)−Φ(d1−σ)]1000Combining these three terms, we get the explicit formula
for EX1:
fαΦ(d1)+cαΦ(−d2)+er−d [Φ(d2−σ)−Φ(d1−σ)] (18)
With (18), (14), and (15), the following two propositions
are straightforward. Note that the pricing formula for the
compound ratchet EIAs had been derived in the literature;
see, for example, Hardy (2004).
Proposition 1 The explicit pricing formula for the
compound ratchet EIA contracts is
Vcr = e−rT{1−α+α( fαΦ(d1)+ cαΦ(−d2)
+er−d [Φ(d2−σ)−Φ(d1−σ)])}T
Proposition 2 The explicit pricing formula for the
simple ratchet EIA contracts is
Vsr = e−rT{1−αT +αT ( fαΦ(d1)+ cαΦ(−d2)
+er−d [Φ(d2−σ)−Φ(d1−σ)])}
We use the formulas in Proposition 1 and 2 to compute
the theoretical prices of typical ratchet EIA contracts. Tables
1 and 2 summarize the results. From these results, it is easy
to see that simple ratchet EIAs is cheaper than compound
ratchet EIAs.

To further quantify the effectiveness of each control
variate, we define variance reduction ratio as follows.
VRR=
Var(naive estimator)
Var(estimator with control variate(s))
(21)
Because most of the computational effort was used to gen-
erate the sample paths of (R˜1, · · · , R˜T ), the additional work
needed to compute C1 and C2 is minor. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to use VRR as a proxy of computational gain.
Table 7 shows the results for the compound ratchet EIA
contract with ‘life of contract” guarantee; and Table 8 shows
the results for the simple ratchet EIA contract with ‘life of
contract” guarantee. C1 is every effective for the compound
ratchet EIAs and C2 is very effective for the simple ratchet
EIAs. The combination of C1 and C2 are most effective in
reducing the estimator’s variances.

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
WORKS
In this paper, we introduced four types of ratchet EIA con-
tacts: compound ratchet, simple ratchet, compound ratchet
with “life of contract” guarantee and simple ratchet “life
of contract” guarantee. We derived the explicit pricing for-
mulas for compound ratchet and simple ratchet contracts.
To our best knowledge, the pricing formula for the simple
ratchet contract is new in the literature. For the products
with “life of contract” guarantee, we suggest using their
counterparts without “life of contract” guarantee as control
variates. The numerical results show that these controls are
quite effective. This also suggests that Monte Carlo meth-
ods can be a very efficient computational tool for pricing
complex insurance products.
Our study also provides computational tools for an-
alyzing the trade-off among various parameters when the
insurance companys design ratchet EIA contracts. For ex-
ample, the following information can be obtained from our
study:
1. The cost difference between compound or simple
ratchet;
2. The effect of participation rate α on cost;
3. The effect of ceiling rate c on cost;
4. The effect of floor rate f on cost; and
5. The effect of the “life of contract” guarantee rate
g on cost.2
