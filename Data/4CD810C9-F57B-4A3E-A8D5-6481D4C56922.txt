1. Introduction 
In recent years, the Taiwan government has exerted 
much effort and allocated required budget in promoting 
the creative and design industries as well as in cultivating 
design talents. Not only are small and medium 
enterprises setting up new design departments and 
recruited industrial designers, many large corporations, 
including internationally renowned brands, Acer, Asus, 
BenQ, etc. have also expanded their design departments 
and upgraded the status of the design function within the 
organization. In a word, the government and enterprises 
in Taiwan are placing great importance to design and 
expect to upgrade the quality of products and national 
competitiveness. According to Er [1997], the 
development of industrial design (ID) in the newly 
industrialized countries can be classified into seven 
stages: 1) Proto-Design Phase, 2) Embryonic Phase, 3) 
Emergence Phase, 4) Development I Phase, 5) 
Development II Phase, 6) Take-off Phase, and 7) 
Maturity Phase. The development of industrial design in 
Taiwan today can be positioned somewhere between the 
Take-off Phase and the Maturity Phase.  
Taiwan established the first collegiate level of industrial 
design department in 1964 and the development of 
industrial design education in Taiwan has a history 
spanning more than forty years. As shown in Figure 1, 
there was six ID related programs in Taiwan in 1987 and 
has been increased up to 26 schools with 29 programs 
now. The number of ID graduates from the years of 1980 
to 1990 was less than two hundred annually, and it is 
about thirteen hundred annually nowadays [Huang & 
You, 1985; Ministry of Education Department of 
Statistics, 2007]. According to the estimation of the 
Chinese Industrial Design Association, the annual need 
of the ID talents in Taiwan is about 600-800 people, 
compared to 1,300 graduates each year, the supply 
should be more than sufficient. However, the design 
departments in industries have claimed that it is not easy 
to find qualified ID talents in the job market [Weng, 
2003]. In addition, the R.O.C. Council for Economic 
Planning and Development [2006] estimated that the 
supply of ID talents would be short of demand in Taiwan 
for the next 10 years. While the industry is eagerly in 
demand of ID talents, can the quality of ID graduates 
satisfy the industry’s need? A study found that 63 
percent of respondents considered a gap existing between 
the quality of design graduates and the industry’s need in 
Taiwan [Chang, 1997]. Kaufman [1998] also reports that 
the quality of ID graduates in the U.S. is less than 
expected. This shows that there is a lack of link between 
what design students’ learn in school and the real

2. Research Design 
The study was conducted in three stages: literature 
review, in-depth interviews, and questionnaire survey. 
The ID profession covers various specialties, and indeed 
there are diverse employment opportunities in the job 
market for the ID graduates. In addition, there indeed 
exist individual differences among ID students with 
various backgrounds and learning processes [Yang et al., 
2005a,b; You et al., 2007a]. Therefore, there is a need to 
systematically collect and sort the vocational information 
about the ID profession. This study referred to some 
international sources, such as International Council of 
Societies of Industrial Design [ICSID, n.d.], Industrial 
Designers Society of America [IDSA, 2004] and U.S. 
Department of Labor [1991, 2008], as well as some 
domestic literature from the government [ROC Council 
of Labor Affairs, 2000&2005] and researchers [Wang & 
Bian, 2003; Zhou et al., 2003]. Then, the above 
information was organized as Table 1.  
Next, the authors conducted in-depth interviews with ID 
practitioners and students to understand their viewpoints 
about the ID profession to supplement the deficiency of 
literature review. Then, following the literature review 
and in-depth interviews, a questionnaire was designed 
and pilot tested before being used in the formal survey. 
The content of the questionnaire is mainly structured 
according to the four aspects addressed by Wise et al. 
[1976], including knowledge, values, preferences, and 
self-concepts. In addition, the authors also consulted to 
related studies done by other disciplines to learn the 
items about career awareness, employment preparations

of the interview results. The required competency for 
industrial designers can be divided into three parts: 1) 
affection: capabilities that cannot be trained within a 
short period of time, such as creative thinking, aesthetic 
literacy, international perspectives, abilities of 
observation and communication, etc.; 2) skills: 
capabilities that are possible to be trained within a 
shorter period of time, such as the skills of sketching, 
computer graphics, model making, etc.; 3) knowledge of 
other disciplines: including marketing, management, 
engineering, etc. Most of the practitioner interviewees 
claimed that the main competency industrial designers 
should possess is the aspects of affection, and skills and 
knowledge of other disciplines are comparatively 
auxiliary. The competences emphasized by the six 
companies are slightly different; for example, the ICT 
industry seeks ID talents with better abilities in the 
aspects of affection, while the CAID team focuses more 
on skills. As for Company E, which does not organize 
the designers in the company into task teams, ID talents 
with both aspects of affection and skills are preferred. 
Company F, a shoe manufacturer with only a few 
designers in the organization, emphasizes on all three 
aspects of competences for the industrial designers. 
Comparing the interviewees’ viewpoints with the 
literature about the work content of the ID profession, 
both are quite consistent. However, the actual content 
about design tasks and required competences would vary 
based on the type of industry and the scale of enterprises. 
These detailed differences are not shown in current 
information about ID profession. For example, most of 
the ICT industry or big scale enterprises have set up 
various task teams to design and develop new products 
together; therefore, there is a need for different 
specialists in the design domain. On the contrary, 
designers work in the traditional industry or small and 
medium sized enterprises usually have to handle a design 
project from the beginning to the end so they are 
expected to be equipped with comprehensive 
competences. The above interview result matches with 
the study done by Yang et al. [2005b]. 
Most interviewed students perceived the ID work content 
as: designing product forms, proposing design concepts, 
observing and understanding user/customer needs, 
creative thinking and sketching, etc. However, there is 
inconsistence among the interviewed students about 
some tasks that industrial designers should be 
responsible for. Some students claim industrial designers 
should personallytake care of everything about design 
projects, such as model making, advertising, package 
design, and marketing, etc., while some consider 
industrial designers are only responsible for their own 
core expertise. In terms of industrial designers’ lifestyle, 
most of the interviewed students claim that it is common 
for designers to work longer hours, staying up late, 
without distinction between workday and holidays, 
flexible schedule on or off duty, etc. The summary of 
interview with the students are: 1) Students perceive 
differently about the ID profession before and after 
entering the university; 2) Students seem to be limited in 
identifying the job titles that ID graduates can be 
qualified; 3) Students perceive that the ratio of female 
designers is out of proportion to male ones and the 
opportunity of promotion for two genders is different; 4) 
Part of the female students claim they are not 
comfortable to deal with mechanism design; 5) Students 
perceive that the distribution of industry, employment 
opportunities, salary, and available information, etc. for 
industrial designers vary from region to region. 
In sum, practitioner and student interviewees agree most 
of the descriptions about the ID profession, but there is a 
need to supplement the details and differences about the 
ID tasks, working environment, salary, and competences 
within the various type of industry and scale of 
enterprises. In addition, those senior student interviewees 
are curious to know more about the industrial designers’ 
actual working situations and lifestyles. For example, 
how designers cooperate within a design team? How

Q19 Industrial designers have a regular work-and-rest lifestyle. 1.87 0.83 
 
In terms of the environment for ID work, students 
perceive: industrial designers might not work in a 
healthy and non-harming environment; ID environment 
might not be simple and it is more liable to have conflicts 
with others. The authors conjecture that students might 
project the learning situations in school to the future 
employment. For example, industrial designers need to 
make models in a workshop; the intensive interactions 
between fellow students might cause arguments or even 
fights. Regarding to industrial designers’ working hours, 
students perceive: industrial designer’s daily working 
hours would be over 8 hours and would not have a 
regular work-and-rest lifestyle. In addition, students 
worry that the task of model making and the lifestyle of 
staying up late would influence one’s health. However, 
according to practitioner interviewees’ viewpoint, the 
task of model making is outsourcing mostly so industrial 
designers in corporations are not usually responsible for 
that. Moreover, designers are fully in charge of design 
projects, if they can arrange the schedule appropriately, it 
is not a common condition for industrial designers to stay 
up late. Regarding the required competences, most of the 
respondents do not hold the language or professional 
license or have passed the qualification examination. In 
addition, they are not equipped with the capabilities of 
utilizing ergonomics in design and doing website design. 
The issue about what competences should industrial 
designers possess is popularly discussed by design 
educators and professionals. Several studies have shown 
that an industrial designer’s competences would vary 
based on what role he is playing during the product 
development process [Ho et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2003], 
the content of design tasks [Yang et al., 2005b], the level 
of design personnel [Wang & Bian, 2003], the scale of 
enterprises and type of industry [Yang et al., 2005a], and 
the need for each country [Yeh, 2003]. In sum, the 
students’ awareness in some of the tasks, required 
competency, and lifestyles of industrial designers does 
not match the reality. If such information does not match 
the students’ expectations, it might lead to their hesitance 
to commit a design career and even influence their 
choice about the future. 
5. Conclusion and Suggestions 
5.1 Conclusion 
College education nowadays is playing an increasingly 
important role in national human resource development. 
It not only teaches knowledge and skills to the youth for 
  12
determine if they are really interested in the design 
occupation, and to generate a network of professional 
contacts as early as possible. In-house ID departments 
and design offices provide intern opportunities for ID 
students, in return, will have a higher prospect of 
recruiting the interns to the company after completing 
education with little or no further on-the-job training. On 
the other hand, if internships are not available, ID 
departments of universities can hold design workshops 
for their students as well. Practitioners and design 
educators from domestic institutions as well as from 
abroad can be invited to lecture or tutor the design 
workshops. Similarly, if students come from different 
departments, universities, and/or countries, the effect of 
interaction and exchange of experience may even be 
better. 
3) To update and revise the ID curriculum and increase 
interdisciplinary interactions. 
In order to enhance the ability of ID students for 
challenge in the future work, the courses of ID program 
need to be updated regularly. Most ID programs 
nowadays belong to college of design and have 
curriculum emphasizing in art and design. This has been 
reflected in the survey, that ID student feel a knowledge 
deficiency in mechanism design, marketing, and material 
and processing. Hence, it is necessary to take a closer 
look into the appropriateness of the current curriculum in 
cultivating qualified designers for the job market. One 
way to supplement necessary knowledge of engineering 
and management is to organize the senior studio project 
teams with students from engineering and management 
departments. This would facilitate cooperation of 
students from different disciplines. The interdisciplinary 
interaction will greatly help the students to get in touch 
of related knowledge and skills from other fields in 
addition to the benefit of personal experience in the 
teamwork.  
4) To improve student abilities in time management 
and personal relations, and to enhance career 
guidance 
The survey reveals that the student conception of 
industrial designers as people working without a regular 
schedule and easy to get conflict with others. They 
project such conception based on their own experiences 
of executing course projects. Therefore, it is important 
for the students to learn how to make good management 
of time and get along with others as early as possible. 
Finally, due to the increase of school positions and 
relaxation of educational regulations, many students are 
entering colleges and quite a big ratio of them may drop 
out or transfer to and from other departments or 
universities consequently. In such circumstances, 
educators should note individual differences of the 
students while giving career guidance. For example, 
students from general high schools and vocational 
schools are different in previous training hence their 
difference in abilities should be taken into consideration 
in course work as well as in career guidance.

221、22日的四個半天中舉辦了 4場的 Doctoral Symposium，使來自世界各地正在進
行設計相關研究的博士生能藉由這樣的機會，發表自己目前的研究內容，並且得到
設計領域資深學者及與會學者的回饋與建議，而能夠更深入思考自身的研究議題。
而在 23-25日的研討會過程，大會於研討會開幕當天 (23日) 安排了一場專題演講。
演講主題為 Creative IT: Does IT Enhance Creativity or Does Creativity Enhance IT? 演
講者Mary Lou Maher教授，是美國國家科學基金會 Creative IT program 的 Director，
目前於澳洲雪梨大學教授設計運算，並擔任學校設計運算與認知中心的
Co-Director。其演講中論及 IT工程對於設計創意的輔助及影響，並說明自己認為創
意的定義是 novel, useful, 和 unexpected，在 Creative IT的相關研究上需考量這三項
操作型定義。其中列舉多項相關之研究成果供與會學者參考，並在結論中提到創意
是一個高層次的評估過程，應併入設計運算的相關研究思考中，且她認為將焦點鎖
定在創意上面，能夠帶來新的設計運算技術、新的研究模式與新的教育環境。因此，
Maher 教授的演說，給予我們對於創意思考的省思，亦即無論在設計實務和設計研
究上，創意都是一個不變的概念核心，即便設計的運算到達如何的尖峰程度，都還
是要回歸到將焦點置放在更勝於新奇與驚奇的創意上面，如此一來，設計實務或是
設計研究才都會是具有生命力的。
本次研討會的研究領域主要包含設計認知與設計運算等相關設計研究領域，涵蓋的
研究主題大致如下所示。研討會的論文發表分為全文發表及海報發表兩種形式，全
文發表部分共有 9個場次、38篇論文，包括 Shape Grammars相關研究 5篇、Design
Cognition-1 相關研究 4 篇、Knowledge-Based Design 相關研究 5 篇、Sketching,
Diagrams, and Visualization相關研究 5篇、Design Creativity相關研究 3篇、Design
Cognition-2相關研究 4篇、Design Support相關論文 5篇、Spatial Configuration相關
研究 3篇, 及 The Virtual and the Physical相關研究 3篇，每個場次的論文發表皆為全
部與會學者共同參與討論，而不似一般研討會分場地進行 parallel sessions，這樣的進
行方式，使所有研究發表能夠因與會學者的多元背景而有不同方向的深入提問與討
論。而在兩個 poster session中，能夠依序聽到 37位研究者分別簡述研究內容，並於
後續的 Poster Viewing Time更進一步的與研究者針對其研究議題進行討論與詢問。
因此，在研討會進行過程中，經由聆聽各國與會學者的論文發表及現場的熱烈問答
情形，使我們對於現今設計研究的發展近況有了更多研究面向的發現與深入的了
解。例如，在有關設計草圖、圖表與視覺化的相關研究之發表場次中，研究者觀察
一般受測者及蒙上眼睛的受測者在心像空間詮釋上的差異，並藉以探究設計經驗, 知
識, 或是視覺刺激對於設計師在空間設計作品上的影響，對於以往著重於評估設計作
品內容來探究設計思維的相關研究，提出了一些有趣而具有評估價值的研究取徑，

6On the other hand, Gero and Kannengiesser (2004) utilized the interactive relationship among the
three worlds, “external world”, “interpreted world” and “expected world”, to illustrate the situated
designing (Figure 1) that may interpret the intention of designer’s active searching-retrieving (S-R)
behaviour. That is, the designer’s S-R behaviour could be regarded as the external presentation of
his/her expected world, and the targets that a designer is searching for or retrieving are predicted
according to current goals and interpretations of the current state. However, what is the designer’s 
behavioural flow like? And what kind of stimuli connects with which type of idea has not been
discussed so frequently in the past research. Especialy, most related research about the designer’s 
thinking and designer’s behaviour has concentrated on the area of product design, engineering design 
and architectural design. Therefore, it is very important to explore the linkage relationship between the
searched content and the transformed ideas in graphic designer’s ideation processes through the 
methods of in-situ observation. Furthermore, our observations on the designers’ sketches aim at
tracing the interlinking of their ideas as far as possible, in which the sketches therefore could be
regarded as a means of providing clues to trace the transformation of the designer’s ideas.

2. Method
This study conducted in-situ observation mainly to research the designer’s behavioural flow and to 
attempt to find the linkage relationship between the content they are searching for and the content they
are sketching in the ideation process. Every participant in this experiment was allowed the greatest
freedom and unrestricted searching for relevant data to perform an assigned task in her practicing
space as the situated designing happened in everyday. Each participant was given the needed time to
perform her task in spite of the progress rate she achieved. We stopped recording when the designer
thought that she has developed an idea she expected to serve as the final representation. At the same
time, in order to avoid interrupting the participants’ ideation process, their behaviour and external 
representation throughout the period were monitored by a digital camera which was placed to the left
side of the designer (see Figure 2), with the aim of gathering the designers’ nonverbal representations.
82.2. CODING SCHEME
The experimental data in this study was segmented according to a set of behavioural codes using the
content analysis technique. The designer’s behaviour coding scheme developed for the analysis were 
adjusted and shared the characteristics of Atman and Bursic’s design activity coding scheme (1996), 
Chusilp and Jin’s cognitive activity model of conceptual design (2004) and Cardela et al.’s 
representation coding scheme (2006). Therefore, ten kinds of behavioural codes were the coding
standards of this research (the ten codes with definition are shown in Table 2). Moreover, the
researchers also examined the whole film to certify that both designers’ behaviours within the 
recorded data could be categorized into the ten codes.
A segment is the behavioural unit that the participants presented which was cut from the raw data
that was transcribed from the video part of the experiment. It is the basic unit to analyze the presenting
order of designer’s searching-retrieving behaviour (S-R behaviour) and other behaviours during the
participants’ ideation process in this study as wel. Furthermore, the completed segments from the 
observations were categorized by two people, one researcher and a coder who was provided with a
behavioural record that had been segmented. Each segment categorized and coded by the coder was
compared to the researcher’s, evaluated for inter-coder reliability, calculating an average rating of
92% agreement.

Figure 3. The behavioural flow of participant A and B
The three stages of the two participants’ behavioural flow in their ideation process is shown in 
Table 3 and interpreted as follows. First of all, in the first stage both participants are reading the task
exposition to analyze the design problem they confronted in which they are appearing to exhibit
chiefly analyzing behaviour. For this reason, the “analyzing stage” absolutely is the term of this period. 
The timescale of this stage is the shortest of the four stages, and took only about 1 minute to 2
minutes of participant A’s and B’s ideation time respectively.
Then participant A started to retrieve relevant information on-line and printed the visual data out as
the reference material to write down the keywords as the ideas they were generating in the first part of
the second stage. Participant B exhibited the same behaviour to record a few keywords in this period
as well. Thus, the main behaviour they are presenting in this period is searching-retrieving for
generating ideas (S-R for GI). After the first part of the second stage, participant A searched for some
visual information from a reference book mainly to create new sketches. At the same part of this stage,
participant B was retrieving visual information on-line through keying in some keywords to create
new representations similar to participant A’s intention. In particular, a large number of sketches were 
done by the two participants in this period: participant A created 11 sketches and participant B 16.
Therefore, the chief behaviour they are showing in the second part of the second stage is
searching-retrieving for creating new sketches (S-R for CNS). However, the major intention of the two
participants in the first and second parts of the stage is forming the conceptualization to solve the
design problem through the connections between S-R behaviour and GI behaviour and between S-R
behaviour and CNS behaviour. The two parts therefore are combined as the “conceptualizing stage” in 
this study.
Lastly, both participants seemed to revise and adjust the sketches, adding some elements to the
previous figures or drawing clear-cut outlines of the previous designs they accomplished in the
previous stage. Therefore, the stage is caled the “visualizing stage” in this study since the major 
intention of the two participants is visualizing the design solution specifically. However, the major
difference between participant A and B is the use of drawing tools while they are sketching in this
period. That is, participant A was drawing the previous designs which were done on paper by the
12
book and pasted memory stickers on the targets she needed as reference materials. And then, she
continued by writing down five keywords which include “wings”, “lines”, “colorful”, “silhouete” and 
“movement”. 
Next, she simultaneously drew some sketches as the first arrow shows and referred to the visual
stimuli she had marked after having pasted memory stickers by or by looking at the keywords she has
writen down before. This period therefore transfered “S-R for GI” into “S-R for CNS” at this point. 
However, the four sketches obviously were influenced by the keywords, such as “heart”, “wheel 
chair”, “people” and “sun”. Then she did another three designs by refering to an abstract form as the 
picture shows which is placed to the left of the second arrow. We then found the three sketches that
participant A had done differed from the others from which we conjecture that she was inspired by the
abstract form. After that, she accomplished another three sketches by referring to the left picture near
the third arrow, which includes figures of people, a running person and several circles, and the ideas
she has used in the figures of the first arrow. Subsequently, she finished the two sketches below by
referring to the picture near by the fourth arrow. She obviously combined a moving figure and the
archery. Following this, she added wings on the first sketch which resulted in the picture below the
fifth arrow. Then she added a square with three figures beneath on the fourth sketch of the first line
that was influenced by the picture above the all the sketches. Lastly, she added a semicircle above the
third sketch of the third line that was affected by the keyword, “rainbow”.
However, we also traced the participant B’s “conceptualizing stage” and describe it as folows. 
During the beginning of the “S-R for GI” period of her conceptualizing stage, she keyed in 
“defectives” and “gymkhana” to retrieve some information on-line to generate ideas. Then she wrote
down eight keywords on a piece of paper like “gymkhana”, “a relay baton”, “activity”, “people”, 
“posture”, “torch”, “moving” and “circle”. After that, she started to draw an incomplete sketch.
Afterward she started to draw a more complete sketch as the first arrow shows accompanied with
S-R behaviour and referred to the marks of defective and Paralympics on-line. This period therefore
transfered “S-R for GI” into “S-R for CNS” at this point. After this, she carried out the second and 
third sketches by referring to the two abstract figures as the picture shows that are placed to the left of
the third arrow. And we also found the sketch as the third arrow directs is different from previous
sketches from which we may conjecture that she was inspired by the two abstract forms. After that,
she carried out the fourth sketch which is composed of the third sketch and a heart figure. Then she
tried to transfer the form of the fourth sketch into the fifth sketch by adjusting the position of the heart
figure. Subsequently, she carried out the sixth sketch by changing the colored ribbon of the previous
sketch to the fire form by referring to the keyword she has writen down, “torch”. And then, she tried 
to draw some new sketches indicated by the seventh and the eighth arrows which were affected by the
keyword, “laurel”. Then she gave up the idea of laurel and kept on adjusting or revising the sixth 
sketch into another two sketches which are indicated by as the ninth arrow. Lastly, she accomplished a
mark through clearly drawing the outline of the figure as the tenth arrow shows and adding black tone
to it.

Figure 5. The model of designer’s behavioural flow in the ideation process
4. Conclusions
This study utilized in-situ observation to examine two professional designers’ ideation process. From 
our results we propose a model for ilustrating the designer’s behavioural flow in the ideation process. 
Four main findings in the study were: first, the designers’ behavioural flow in the ideation process is
divided into three main stages between the problem input and the solution output, that is, the
“analyzing stage”, the “conceptualizing stage” and the “visualizing stage”, and the “conceptualizing 
stage” includes the duration of “S-R for GI” and “S-R for CNS”. Second, the designers tend to 
generate more diferent directions of ideas in the “S-R for GI” period and combine diferent ideas or 
combine them with their imagination in the “S-R for CNS” period. Third, the visual stimuli with more 
concrete features that designers found was utilized to combine with others to form a complete idea
while the visual stimuli with more abstract features seem to be combined with the designer’s 
imagination to form some ideas that differed from the previous ideas. Fourth, designers tend to
develop similar ideas when the references they searched for were more concrete. On the contrary, the
abstract visual stimuli seem to give designers more different kinds of perspectives to form a greater
diversity of ideas than the concrete visual stimuli did.
Finally, there are some restrictions and insufficiencies during our research that we should revise in
any further study. They include the number of the participants and the results through in-situ
observation are the limitations in this study. For the number of the participants, the research may be
regarded as a pilot study for proposing an analytical method to the related research in the design field.
However, it is still insufficient to interpret the deep linkage relationship between the searched content
and the transformed ideas in designer’s ideation flowmerely through the method of in-situ observation.
Therefore, other possible methods should be utilized as future studies.

DESIGNERS’BEHAVIORAL FLOW IN IDEATION PROCESS

1. The Purpose of This Study
A designer’s designing is described as the wel known interactive structure of “seeing-moving-seeing” 
(Schön and Wiggins 1992) based on his/her “reflection”. Designers’ seeing action may include both 
their active searching intention and the content they are seeing. Refering to Gero and Kannengiesser’s 
discourse (2004) about the designers’ three worlds in designing, their searching-retrieving (S-R)
behaviour could be regarded as the external presentation driven by their expected world, and the
targets they are seeing might be the searched content that exists in their external world. However, what
kind of stimuli a designer saw connects with which type of idea he/she got has not been discussed so
frequently in the past research. In particular, most related research about the designers’ thinking and 
behaviour has concentrated on the area of product, engineering and architectural design (Akin 1984;
Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995; Lawson 2004). Therefore, the study chiefly researched the graphic
designers’ searching-retrieving (S-R) behaviour and attempted to find the linkage relationship between
the content they are searching for and the content they are sketching in the ideation process for tracing
the interlinking of their ideas as far as possible.
2. Experimental Design
The study carried out an experiment in the two professional graphic designers’practicing space in
order to capture their external behaviours, searched content and the changing process of their sketches
within the ideation process. Every participant in this experiment was allowed the greatest freedom to
search for relevant data and given the needed time to perform an assigned task in spite of the progress
rate they achieved as the situated designing happened in everyday practice. Moreover, in order to
avoid interupting the participants’ ideation process, the study merely monitored their external and
nonverbal behaviours throughout the period by a digital camera which was placed to the left side of
the designer.
The observed data of the two graphic designers was segmented according to a set of behavioural
coding scheme and examined to ensure that all recorded behaviours could be categorized into the
behavioural codes by the researchers. Then the connective relationships between the searched content
and the transformed ideas were drawn after discussing the exhibited order of the two designers’ al 
behaviours and sketches in detail (see Figure 1).
