4optically smooth and uniformly flat as well. It is less expensive to produce flat
glass than it is to grind and polish glass produced by other processes, and the
quality of the float-glass surface is higher. Nature abounds with examples of
self-assembly, such as a rain drop on a leaf. The liquid drop has a smooth,
curved surface of just the kind required for optical lenses. Grinding a lens of
that shape would be a major undertaking. Yet the liquid assumes this shape
spontaneously, because molecules at the interface between liquid and air are
less stable than those in the interior. The laws of thermodynamics require that a
raindrop take the form that maximizes its energetic stability. The smooth,
curved shape dose so by minimizing the area of the unstable surface. This type
of self-assembly is known as thermodynamic self-assembly, works to construct
only the simplest structures.
On the other hand, living organisms represent the extreme in complexity.
They are also self-assembling: cells reproduce themselves each time they
divide. Complex molecules inside a cell direct its function. Complex
subcomponents help to sustain cells. The construction of a cell's complexity is
balanced thermodynamically by energy-dissipating structures within the cell
and requires complex molecules such as ATP. An embryo, and eventually new
life, can arise from the union of two cells, whether or not human beings attend

[4].
It is believed that learning how to create large supramolecular units, and
the elucidation of rules mediating their macroscopic organization into
functional materials, will offer a fascinating prospect for technology.
Supramolecular chemistry has already demonstrated the possibility of
assembling well-defined smaller structures, as pioneered by Lehn and
co-workers [6]. The meaning of this term is“chemistry beyond the molecule”,
that is the chemistry of molecular assemblies using noncovalent bonds [7]. As
mentioned previously, Whitesides and co-workers have also studied some
systems with the objective of synthesizing well-defined nano-scale compounds
with molar mass of a few kilodaltons [8]. The self-assembly of other organic

1.2.1 Self-assembly Principles ofπ-Conjugated Systems
π-conjugated polymers are the most promising materials for applications
in less expensive and flexible electronic devices. The basic structures of these
semi-conducting polymers are listed in Figure 1-3 [11]. They have been
fabricated into light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [12-13], field-effect transistors
(FETs) [14], and photovoltaic cells [15]. The performance of molecular devices
is determined by the chemical structures, purity, and the supramolecular
structures (see Figure 1-4) of theπ-conjugated molecules [11]. Thus, the
importance of controlling supramolecular architectures is by so far the most
delicate for semi-conducting polymers.

point charges of -1/2 each) (as shown in Figure 1-5). One of the important
outcomes of this model is that geometries different from face-to-face have
hardly been recognized in the design of supramolecular architectures.

Besides, the stiffness asymmetry of rod-coil block copolymers would result in
the increase inχparameter. Thus, even in low molecular weight oligomer
systems (consisting ofπ-conjugated rigid segments), micro-phase separation
could exactly occur. While a non-solvent for one block is used, the polymer
would have self-assembled in the solution and the final supramolecular
architecture has been decided.
1.2.2 Literature Survey for Self-assembly ofπ-Conjugated Systems
During the past decade, molecular packing and self-assembly of
conjugated polymers and oligomers have interested many research groups all
over the world due to the versatile applications in optoelectronic devices
[60-73]. Among them, Stupp [74-79] and Meijer [80-97] groups are most active
and have already got many results and derived reasonable theories for
π-conjugated systems.
Figure 1-6 Chemical structure of the rod-coil polymers studied in ref. 74. The
structural units of the polyisoprene segments result from 3,4 addition (x) (~
71%) and 1,2 addition (y) (~29%) [74].

Figure 1-7 Unfiltered TEM image of rod-coil polymers having rod fraction=
0.35 (upper left), 0.20 (upper right), 0.30 (down) [74].
Stupp reported in 1999 [75] on synthesis and characterization of several
triblock rod-coil molecules consisting of blocks of oligostyrene, oligoisoprene,
and a rigid rod block (as shown in Figure 1-8). These molecules contain
conformationally rigid and flexible sequences and luminescent chromophores
based on phenylene vinylene. By electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction
results, it was found that these systems could self-organize into supramolecular
nanostructures which in turn assemble into monolayers. The nanostructures
have diameters between 3.5 and 5 nm, and the regularity of the nanostructures
depends on rod-to-coil volume fraction. Interestingly, the formation of
supramolecular nanostructures and the observed hierarchical order in the
materials formed by rod-coil molecules can be completely suppressed by
lowering the rod-to-coil volume ratio. When the chemical structure of rod

with nano-scale dimensions. The strips are 8 nm in width and approximately 80
nm in length (left). (Right) Molecular graphics model showing the herringbone
packing of the phenylene vinylene oligomeric rods. [75].
In 2004 [76], Stupp and co-workers synthesized a series of three
molecules with dendron rod-coil architecture that contain conjugated segments
of oligo(thiophene), oligo(phenylene-vinylene), and oligo(phenylene) as shown
in Figure 1-10. Atomic force microscopy revealed self-assembly of the
molecules into high aspect ratio ribbon-like nanostructures (see Figure 1-11)
which at low concentrations induce gelation in nonpolar solvent. The assembly
of these molecules into one-dimensional nanostructures is a route toπ-π
stacked supramolecular polymers for organic electronic functions. In the
oligo(thiophene) derivative, self-assembly leaded to a 3 orders of magnitude
increase in the conductivity of iodine-doped films due to self-assembly.

The same group reported the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic
molecules consisting of oligo(phenylene vinylene) (OPV) asymmetrically
end-substituted with a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segment and a
hydrophobic alkyl chain [77]. This amphiphilic structure induces self-assembly

onto freshly cleaved mica were imaged by AFM (see Figure 1-15). Images
reveal collections of micron-long, one-dimensional nanostructures with a
height that varies periodically from 6 to 9.3 nm above the mica surface and
with a regular pitch of 28 (3 nm along their length. Images of isolated
nanostructures formed by R- and S-DRC molecules are clearly mirror images
of each other (Figure 3), forming left- and right-handed helices, respectively.
Interestingly, AFM studies of self-assembled racemic DRC molecules show
similar helical features with left- and right-handed ribbon-like structures with
the same periodicity. They proposed that interactions among chiral coil
segments of R- and S-DRC molecules control the handedness of the helical
pitch. They believed this control is rooted in steric constraints imposed by the
chiral centers in the coil segment, hence, the supramolecular handedness they
observed. The formation of the well-defined, molecular scale, mirror image
nanostructures may result from the significant separation between the
stereocenter and hydrogen bonding dendron (more than 4 nm). They proposed
when stereocenters and intermolecular bond-forming functional groups are in
proximity, supramolecular structures might be more prone to organize into
large, hierarchical chiral structures than to form well-defined objects on the
molecular scale.
24
Figure 1-16 Chemical structures of sexithiophenes with chiral and achiral
penta(ethylene glycol) chains [84].
fluorescence, circular dichroism, and circular polarization of luminescence
spectroscopic data showed that these compounds form chiral aggregates in
polar solvents and in the solid state. Solid state aggregation behavior was
investigated by AFM. AFM data they have previously collected on various
conjugated / nonconjugated rod-coil copolymers all showed regular
arrangements of microfibrillar structures, such as those observed in Figure
1-17a. This fibrillar morphology appeared to be a typical signature of the
organization of these conjugated copolymers in the solid state. The fibrils are in
fact ribbon-like objects, as their width is much larger than their height (in the
image of Figure 1-17a, the width ranges from 30 to 50 nm, while the height is
around 3 nm). Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) allows one to
image the internal structures of those large ribbons. A typical image is shown
in Figure 1-17b: the large ribbons comprise a few (often five) individual thin
ribbons, approximately 7 nm in width. The formation of ribbons, as in the case
of other conjugated homopolymers [98] or block copolymers [99], took place
by self-assembly governed byπ-πstacking of the sexithiophene units. These

In 2003, Meijer group [85] synthesized a series of
oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) dimers, tetramers and hexamers (see Figure
1-18) and observed their organization into highly organized 2D crystals on
graphite by spontaneous self-assembly. The unit cell parameters of these
monolayers could be determined and a profound effect of the length of the
π-conjugated backbone on the adlayer structure was discovered (as shown in
Table 1-2 and Figure 1-19 ~ Figure 1-21). For all oligomers, the OPV-units
were aligned in rows, with the alkyl chains residing in between the rows. In the
hexamer, the organization was strongly determined bythe π-system.

complementary approaches for the control of molecular assembly into
well-defined structures on the nano-scale, applied to oligothiophenes (as shown
in Figure 1-22) as a typical conjugated system [86]. They considered
self-assembly in solution, sublimation of individual molecules in the vapor
phase, and aggregation in thin deposits from compounds molecularly dispersed
in a solution. They demonstrated that the development of substituted, soluble
π-conjugated materials allows not only a control of their organization in the
solid state but also the possibility of determining the degree of order in solution.
During these self-assembly processes, the interplay between the conjugated
molecules, the solvent, and the substrate surface is of primary importance.
Depending on the interactions between the molecules and the substrate,
two-dimensional (platelets, see Figure 1-23, 1-24) or one-dimensional
(nanowires, see Figure 1-25) objects can be generated.

(2.5 x 2.5μm2). Only 3b shows left-handed helical aggregates [86].
PPV-series oligomer systems were also investigated by Meijer and his
coworkers. They reported in 2004 [87] an interesting case of a gelation-assisted
helix transition during the hierarchical self-assembly of a rigidπ-conjugated
system (see Figure 1-26) to form coiled-coil helical ropes. Field emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of C-OPV1 from a dilute
solution in dodecane showed left-handed helical fibers of 20–50 nm in
diameter and a few micrometers in length with an uniform helical pitch of
approximately 150 nm (Figure 1-27a). However, the FESEM image of
C-OPV1 (partially gelled) from a more concentrated solution in dodecane

main plot at different temperatures, but just within the range 24–35oC [87].
Fluorene-based diblock and triblock copolymers (Figure 1-31) were also
studied by Meijer [88]. Figure 1-32 illustrates the typical results obtained on
different oligofluorene-based systems. The AFM images of thin deposits of
these compounds showed a typical morphology: fibrils as long bright objects
lying flat on the mica substrate. The AFM technique thus provided an
extremely detailed description of the microscopic morphology of the material
under study, but usually it did not allow to distinguish individual molecules or
polymer chains. Therefore, in order to understand how those were formed from
molecularly dissolved solutions and how the molecules were packed within the
supramolecular organizations leading to the observed morphologies, models of
the chain assembly can be proposed, using a theoretical approach based on
molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.
Molecular mechanics is a theoretical approach developed to provide
information on the structure of large molecules such as proteins and polymers.

segments. Among the different possible configurations, the most stable is the
‘head-to-tail’ configuration, where the fluorene chains have the possibility to
pack and form the core of the ribbon, and the PEO segment of one chain is on
the opposite side of the nano-ribbon compared to the PEO segment on the
adjacent molecule. This configuration globally provided enough space for the
PEO segments to be fully extended, and could explain the larger width of
nano-ribbons compared to the estimation of the length of the molecule (11± 1
nm vs 9.7 nm) as shown on Fig. 1-33b.
In 2005, Meijer reported a feature article [89] to introduce self-assembled
fibers based on π-conjugated segments. He gave a plot (concluded from their
previous work [90]) to show the dependence of morphology on both the
solution concentration and surface type (see Figure 1-34). At higher
concentrations an intertwined network was formed while at low concentrations
ill-defined globular objects were observed. Molecule–surface interactions are
also crucial to successfully transfer the supramolecular stack present in solution
to a solid support (inert surfaces: graphite and silicon oxide). When the
molecule–molecule interactions present in the supramolecular stacks in
solution were perturbed by stronger molecule–surface interactions (attractive
surfaces: gold), the stacks cannot be transferred to the surface. Repulsive

1.3. Introduction to Hybrid Organic–Inorganic Nanocomposites
Organic-Inorganic hybrid materials have opened a door to innovative and
advanced applications. They can be defined as nanocomposites with organic
and inorganic components, intimately mixed. Hybrids are either homogeneous
systems derived from monomers and miscible organic and inorganic
components, or heterogeneous systems (nanocomposites) where at least one of
the components’domains has a dimension ranging from some Å to several
nanometers [100]. It is obvious that properties of these materials are not only
the sum of the individual contributions of both phases, but the role of the inner
interfaces could be predominant. The nature of the interface has been used to
grossly divide these materials into two distinct classes. In class I, organic and
inorganic components are embedded and only weak bonds (hydrogen, van der
Waals or ionic bonds) give the cohesion to the whole structure. In class II
materials, the two phases are linked together through strong chemical bonds
(covalent or iono-covalent bonds).
Sanchez and co-workers have reported many articles about hybrid
44
Figure 1-35 Scheme of the main chemical routes for the synthesis of
organic–inorganic hybrids [101].
Route A2: The use of bridged precursors such as silsesquioxanes.
X3Si–R’–SiX3 (R’is an organic spacer, X = Cl, Br, OR) allow the formation of
homogeneous molecular hybrid organic–inorganic materials which have a
better degree of local organisation. Route A3: Hydrothermal synthesis in polar
solvents (water, formamide, etc.) in the presence of organic templates had
given rise to numerous zeolites with an extensive number of applications in the
domain of adsorbents or catalysts.
Path B corresponds to the assembling (route B1) or the dispersion (route
B2) of well-defined nanobuilding blocks (NBB) which consists of perfectly
46
strategies and those above described along paths A, B, and C allow the
construction of hierarchically organized materials in terms of structure and
functions [106,107].
In a word, hybrid materials have great potential to be made into
commercial products. In combination of the merits of organic and inorganic
individuals [Figure 1-35], hybrid materials truly play the major role in the
nanoscience/ nanotechnology field in the 21st century. In this proposal, the
hybrid systems of amphiphilic organics / silica as well as amphiphilic organics
/ titania are studied.

The synthesis of these two molecules began with the Horner–Wittig
reaction to form a co-planar p-conjugated trans-phenylene vinylene oligomer,
followed by linking with PEO17 (PEO8) through a sulfonate group. Notably,
the PPV trimer is recognized as almost a co-planar trans-linkage structure
because little resonance at d = 6.5–6.8 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum
attributable to the cis-vinylene protons was detected (Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-9 presents their 3-D primary structure, constructed by a Cerius 2
energy minimization. It is interestingly to find that the as-tetrahedral shape of
the sulfonate linking group caused a twist in the molecule between
hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. Due to the soft nature of the PEO
segment, PEO17–
OPV3 and PEO8–OPV3 are also considered as a rod–coil molecule.
Undoubtedly, both amphiphilic and rod–coil characters play improyant roles on
the formation of self-assembling supramolecular structure.

Chapter 3 Molecular Packing in the Solutions
3.1. Introduction
In this Chapter, we used surface tension meter and photoluminescence
technique to investigate the molecular packing and aggregation behaviors of
amphiphilc molecules in the solutions.
Surface tension is historically one of the more popular means to determine
critical micelle concentrations (CMC) [108,109]. The surface tension plotted
against the log of the surfactant concentration, as shown in Scheme 3-1
typically shows three main regions: (a) an almost horizontal section at very low
concentrations; (b) a steep linear decline at intermediate concentrations; and (c)
a flat region at high concentrations. The point at which region (b) intercepted
with region (c) is taken as the critical micelle concentration (CMC). In our
work, both amphiphilic molecules showed these behaviors (and we used this
term“CAC”, critical aggregation concentration).
Since our amphiphilic molecules are also light-emitting molecules, we
subjected them into photoluminescence measurement. Some groups tried to use
PL technique to study the molecular packing behaviors and supramolecular
architecture forming [60, 76-77]. Under dilute condition, the amphiphiles could
be assumed molecularly dispersed in the solution and emit light reflecting their
66
amphiphiles’packing behavior. And the photoluminescence results were truly
consistent to the surface tension results. Thus, PL technique could be applied to
our system to investigate the formation of supramolecular architectures.
3.2. Experimental
3.2.1. Preparation of Amphiphilic PEO17-OPV3 Solution Samples for
Measurements of Surface Tensiometry and Fluorescence Spectroscopy
A stock solution of 1.08 x10-2 M was prepared by dissolving 1.25 g
PEO17-OPV3 in selected solvents to 100 mL. For toluene system, the stock
solution was diluted to 9.46x10-3, 8.6x10-3, 6.75x10-3, 5.56x10-3, 4.3x10-3,
3.38x10-3, 2.15x10-3, 1.08x10-3, 9.46x10-4, 8.6x10-4, 6.75x10-4, 5.56x10-4,

5.56x10-5, 4.3x10-5, 3.38x10-5, 2.15x10-5, 1.08x10-5 (M). For water system, the
stock solution was diluted to 5.56x10-3, 4.3x10-3, 3.38x10-3, 2.15x10-3,
1.08x10-3, 9.46x10-4, 8.6x10-4, 6.75x10-4, 5.56x10-4, 4.3x10-4, 3.38x10-4,

3.38x10-5, 2.15x10-5, 1.08x10-5 (M). Excitaion wavelength of 340 nm was
chosen for the photoluminescence measurements.

3.3. Results and Discussion
3.3.1. Determanation of Critical Aggregation Concentration (CAC) by
Surface Tension Meter
Critical aggregation concentration (CAC) values of 3.67 x 10-4 M for
PEO17-OPV3 in water and 9 x 10
-4 M for PEO8-OPV3 were determined by
surface tension meter (as shown in Figure 3-1 and 3-2). It is believed that
above CAC, molecular aggregation to larger domains occurs. With a
hydrophilic long segment linking with hydrophobic PPV conjugated segment,
PEO17-OPV3 and PEO8-OPV3 could dissolve in both polar and aploar solvents.
In our study, the CAC of PEO8-OPV3 is higher than that of PEO17-OPV3. These
two amphiphilic molecules both have a three-ring aromatic rod segment, but
the length of hydrophilic polyethyleneoxide soft chain is different. Two
possible mechanisms can be used to explain the higher CAC of PEO8-OPV3. If
the hydrophilic-hydrophilic interaction (crystallization of PEO segments)
drives the packing, it is believed longer the PEO soft chain, amphiphilic
molecules could easily self-assemble into stable structure such as PEO17-OPV3
in our study. Thus, PEO8-OPV3 needs higher concentration to form molecular
clusters. Another possible driving force for molecular packing is π- π
interaction. Taking PEO free chain behavior into consideration, PEO8-OPV3

formation of excimers. Meanwhile, the second peak shifted to 440 nm and
became the major peak in the concentration(c) range: 3.38 x 10-4 M < c < 4.3 x
10-3 M. Finally, the major peak shifted to 471 nm as c > 5.56 x 10-3 M. At this
point, it is reasonable to make a conjecture that a larger molecular-packing
structure was formed and had a different photophysical emission center from
the excimers. From the plot of relative intensities (as shown in Figure 3-5,
I474nm/I445nm for water and I471nm/I440nm for toluene), two-step slopes for the
increase of relative intensities were found. Interestingly, the intersection for
water was located at ~ 5 x 10-4 M near the CAC value determined by surface
tension meter. It indicates that the PL measurements are able to detect the
formation of supramolecular structures.
Similar results were observed in PEO8-OPV3 case. In water (as shown in
Fig. 3-6), excimer-like emission at 475 nm was dominant in dilute solution.
With increasing concentration, the main peak would be shifted to 488 nm as a
result of forming large aggregates or supramolecular structures. On the other
hand, in toluene (as shown in Fig. 3-7), typical 0-0 and 1-0 vibrational peaks
located at 415 and 435 nm were observed in dilute solution. As concentration
was increased, 0-0 vibrational peak that was often attributed to the molecularly
dispersed emission gradually disappeared due to the formation of excimers.

tensiometry). On the other hand, in toluene system, another strange difference
was found. While concentration went higher, the third peak (468 nm) did not be
dominant in PEO8-OPV3 case as it behaved in PEO17-OPV3 case. In our opinion,
it might be due to the higher hydrophobicity for PEO8-OPV3 compared to
PEO17-OPV3. As a result, in apolar toluene system, PEO8-OPV3 would form a
stable structure in the second stage (emission at 440 nm) with little amount of
larger aggregates.
3.4. Concluding Remarks
Surfactant behavior of both PEO17-OPV3 and PEO8-OPV3 was evidenced by
surface tension meter. The CAC is 3.67 x 10-4 M for PEO17-OPV3 and 9 x 10
-4
M for PEO8-OPV3. Longer the hydrophilic PEO segment would result in lower
critical aggregation concentration (CAC). The possible reason might be the
severe hindrance of PEO to prevent OPV segments from forming larger
molecular clusters by π- π interaction. Besides, we used PL technique to
probe the formation of supramolecular architectures. The transition

In our study, we used tapping mode AFM to operate our experiments. In
AFM applications to soft materials, such as polymers and biological samples, it
was found that high tip-to-sample forces in the contact mode and, especially
the presence of lateral forces, often led to mechanical deformation of the
surface. The need to avoid surface damage was one of major motivations for
the development of the tapping mode, a popular AFM technique. In this mode,
short, intermittent contacts between the tip and the surface minimizes the
inelastic deformation of the sample. Numerous examples confirmed that the
effective forces experienced by the sample in the tapping mode are smaller than
in the contact mode.
A broad range of soft materials, especially biological samples, became
accessible for imaging with the advent of the tapping mode. The operation at
small forces does not totally exclude the possibility of surface deformation
during scanning. Measurements at different force levels are an indispensable
part of tapping mode imaging. In this mode, variation of the tip-to-sample force
can be achieved by changing the driving amplitude and the set-point amplitude

Observation
The solution was prepared by dissolving PEO17-OPV3 in water/THF (1:1

was placed into the prepared solution in a Petri dish and maintained in flat
position for 48 h before the solution was removed with a dropper. The
sample-deposited mica was then conditioned at ambient environment for 24 h,
followed by thermal annealing at 120 oC in vacuum oven for 12 h.

propose that this enclosed periphery area has a core-shell morphology with the
OPV rigid segments forming the core and the PEO soft segments forming the
shell. The top view of supramolecular model is schematically shown in Figure
4-3. The brown part represents the rigid OPV core and the red represents the
soft PEO shell.
To our knowledge, the formation of these self-assembly supramolecular
structures might be influenced by the hydrophilicity of mica surface. Owing to
the strong polarity of mica surface, hydrophilic PEO segments would have a
tendency to lie flat on the surface whereas the hydrophobic OPV segments
would tilt with its co-planar configuration normal to the surface. Most of the
research groups (as we have mentioned in Chapter 1) studying the
supramolecular structures of oligo-PPV observed the structures with high
aspect ratio, such as fibril or cylindrical textures, truly different from our
observation. Two factors are possibly involved for the formation of ring
structures: (1) The twist of molecules in between hydrophobic and hydrophilic
segments renders them to have only one side with the same curvature to
proceed π-π stacking and; (2) The high interfacial tension between mica and
hydrophobic OPV segments causes the π-π stacking region to curl in order
to reduce the interfacial area. Thus, thermodynamically, the packing region of

(a) THF/water = 10:4. Figure 4-5 and figure 4-6 shows a
cylindrical-like structure (on a mica disk) with an average size of 10-20 nm in
short axis and 30-40 nm in long axis. In reality, under low magnification, these
cylindrical-like particles would be likely to form a liner, columnar, single or
double strand ribbons as shown in Figure 4-7. Similar to that reported by
Akutagawa [112], the formation of the oriented linear ribbons might to
attributed to the self-assembly of cylindrical-like particles along the directions
of the K+ array on the mica surface having 6-fold symmetry during the film
deposition process. From previous discussion, we might see the cylindrical-like
structures as the primary assemblies where columnar stacking might be seen as
the secondary supramolecular architectures. While wafer was applied to the
thin film preparation, close-packed ellipse-like particles were observed (as
shown in Figure 4-8 ~ Figure 4-10). The dimension of each particle was
exactly the same as that on the mica disk. Due to the native oxide formed on
the wafer, the surface was isotropic which could not induce the ellipse-like
particles to form linear, ribbon-like oriented domains. Instead of isolated
particles, the amphiphilic PEO8-OPV3 molecules seemed to rearrange to a
continuous network structure while deposited on an ITO glass (Figure 4-11 ~
Figure 4-13). The width of each coil was about 5 nm that was identical to a

While water content overweighs THF, the self-assembling molecules will tend
to form denser spherical assemblies due to more severe hydrophilic
environment for OPV segments, which result in circular-shaped architectures
after solvent evaporation. As THF overweighs, loosely cylindrical assemblies
form in the solution and finally result in oval-shaped structures. These results
are summarized in Table 4-1.

4.4. Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to observe and to
identify the supramolecular structures formed by neat PEO17-OPV3 and
PEO8-OPV3. In PEO17-OPV3 case, ring-like assemblies of 30 nm in diameter
were found. The width of enclosed periphery area on both side of the ring
ranging from 5 to 10 nm is the same order of magnitude as the length of
PEO17–OPV3 molecule. Thus, we believe that this enclosed periphery area has
a core-shell morphology with the OPV rigid segments forming the core and the
PEO soft segments forming the shell. For PEO8-OPV3 case, the final structures
are co-solvent and substrate dependent. While THF overweighed water,
cylindrical assemblies were seen due to its loosely packing. However,
tightly-packing to form spherical assemblies were found while water content
overweighed THF. In general, the size is about 30 nm and the possible model is
a hollow sphere or a cylinder. The wall is in core-shell type. The OPV
segments form the inner core and the PEO coils make up the outer shell.
Substrate dependence of supramolecular architectures was also pronounced. Ito
glass could make the assemblies collapse and break, then rearrange to another
structure in loosely packing case. Automatically-flat mica and wafer could give
the assemblies better condition to deposit onto them. On mica, for

zeolites to present different types of shape selectivity, i.e., product, reactant,
and transition state, which can be used to direct a given catalytic reaction
toward the desired product avoiding undesired side reactions. (6) All of these
properties of zeolites, which are of paramount importance in catalysis and
make them attractive choices for the types of processes listed above, are
ultimately dependent on the thermal and hydrothermal stability of these
materials. In the case of zeolites, they can be activated to produce very stable
materials not just resistant to heat and steam but also to chemical attacks.
To extend the idea of mesoporous materials templated by short chain
surfactants, some groups used amphiphilic block copolymers to fabricate
organic / inorganic silica hybrids [116-120] in order to looking for possible
applications. For example, Wiesner [116] prepared the silica-type
mesostructures from block copolymer phases and study the formation
mechanism (as shown in Scheme 5-1 and Scheme 5-2). Since our molecules
have amphiphilic properties combined with rod-coil feature, we tried to hybrid
amphiphilic molecules with silicate precursors to fabricate organic / inorganic
composites. Interestingly, ring-like thin disks and islands of nano-dimension
were observed and their formation mechanisms were discussed.

5.2.3. Preparation of PEO8-OPV3/Silica Hybrid Samples for AFM
Observation
A solution of 0.15 g (0.2 mmol) PEO8-OPV3 in 5 mL THF was prepared
and vigorously stirred for 30 min while the silica source solution (0.9 mmol
TEOS, 2.7 mmol ethanol, 7.2 mmol water, and 0.12 mmol HCl ) was added
dropwise. The mixture was heated to 60 oC with stirring and maintained for 90
min. Afterward, the mixture was diluted by 2 mL EtOH and 1 mL water before
allowed to react for another 96 h at room temperature. The molar composition
was 1.0 TEOS: 77 THF : 69 H2O : 0.13 HCl : 0.22 PEO8-OPV3 : 51.9 EtOH.
To prepare a thin film for AFM observation, 1 mL of the above solution was
further diluted by 3 mL THF and 6 mL water in a Petri dish and an
automatically-flat mica disk was dipped into the solution and maintained in flat
position for 48 h. Then, the solution was removed with a dropper. The

play as a template for the formation of supramolecular structure of
PEO17-OPV3/Silica hybrid.
The exact mechanism to form the ring-like thin supramolecular
architecture is not clear. However, we believed that at least three criterions
listed below should be followed for its formation. First, PEO17-OPV3
molecules dissolving in solution in the first step of sample preparation should
not have a tight packing either for hydrophobic or hydrophilic segments.
Otherwise, further organization to a larger supramolecular architecture would
be difficult. Thus, THF, a good solvent for both segments, was used. Second,
the condensation reactions of TEOS through hydrolysis by HCl to form silicate
oligomers should not go over 25% of total reacting groups. Otherwise a three
dimensional network will form and will condense as a small gelled particle
[143]. A large scale gelation occurs as the extent of reactions reaches 33%.
Third, only the silicate oligomers that participate the formation of
supramolecular architectures are allowed to deposit on mica in the second step
of sample preparation. The sililcate oligomers that have no interaction with
PEO17-OPV3 molecules should remain in solution and should be removed as
much as possible after deposition of supramolecular architectures.
132
5.3.2. Solid-state Self-assembly from a PEO8-OPV3 / Silica Hybrid
Similar to PEO17-OPV3/Silica hybrid case, the solution system of
PEO8-OPV3/Silica hybrid becomes more complex after addition of a pre-gelled
silicate solution to PEO8-OPV3 in THF. After reaction and dilution at proper
conditions, the supramolecular architecture of nano-islands was formed (Figure
5-9 ~ Figure 5-18). Although each island did not have the same morphology,
the assemblies distribution was order and the size of the width was rather
uniform and of about 100 nm. Besides, simple dip coating could provide a
monolayer (mostly of 1 nm in thickness, some bright spots of 2 nm) thin film.
All the features described above point out that the self-assembly process truly
occurred and the architecture was thermodynamically stable. However, the
mechanism and driving force to this kind of island structures are not clear and
should be complex. In our view, PEO8-OPV3 templated silica nanocomposite,
compared to PEO17-OPV3 templated one, the surface is quite rough and it looks
like many small domains to assembly into a larger one. If this is true, we
should go back to check their supramolecular architecture formed by neat
PEO8-OPV3 molecules. According to the results in Chapter 4, the basic
structure is spherical-like assemblies. Thus, we can propose that these
assemblies attracted silicate oligomers due to the outer-layer hydrophilic PEO
134
5.4. Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we successfully fabricate nano-scale silicate hybrids for
PEO17-OPV3 and PEO8-OPV3 cases. In the former case, ring-like disks of about
150 nm in diameter were observed and a multi-lamellar model was proposed.
By analyzing the thickness of these thin disks, it is concluded that each layer
was assembled byπ-πstacking between OPV segments. The general packing
type is the same as that in neat PEO17-OPV3 system. The future work would be
manipulating these thin disks and applying them to some optoelectronic
devices, such as photodiodes. However, in PEO8-OPV3 case, we got
nano-islands of about 100 nm in width. Different from PEO17-OPV3 case, these
assemblies are not uniform in morphology and look like secondary
architectures. Each island is assembled by several small spherical assemblies
which is the primary structure in neat PEO17-OPV3 system. Thus, we propose a
spherical-assembled model for the formation of larger supramolecular
architectures.
In combination of Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, it is clear to see that the
relationship between neat system and hybrid system is truly close. Thus, if we
want to use organic / inorganic nano-hybrids in some aspects, understanding
the basic assembly and packing type for amphiphilic organic parts is quite

Chapter 6 Solid-State Supramolecular Architectures of
Amphiphilic Molecules’Titania Hybrid
6.1. Introduction
Titania (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted vast attention during the past
two decades [144-171] owing to their versatile applications, such as solar cells
[144-145] and photocatalysts [146]. Various forms of TiO2 nanostructures have
been reported including spheres [147], wires [148], tubes [149] and rods [150].
However, the resulting morphologies are highly dependent on the synthetic
routes and their associated preparation method, such as sol-gel processes
[151-152], template methods [153-154] and hydrothermal treatments [155].
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) based on TiO2 nano-crystals are
currently attracting widespread and intense academic and industrial interest for
the conversion of sunlight into electricity because of their low cost and
environmentally friendly photovoltaics with good efficiencies comparable to
those of silicon cells. Isoda and his co-workers [172] have prepared highly
crystalline TiO2 nanorods with lengths of 100-300 nm and diameters of 20-30
nm by a hydrothermal process in a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
surfactant solution (see Scheme 6-1). The microstructure measured by X-ray
diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was a pure
158
In this Chapter, we used a light-emitting amphiphilic molecule,
PEO17-OPV3, to serve as a structure-directing agent for co-organizing with
titania precursors to fabricate the nano hollow-rods and their aggregating
microspheres. FT-IR and EDX were employed to examine the composition of
this hybrid material. The formed microspheres of ~1 μm observed by SEM 
were composed of bundles of hollow-rods. By grinding the microspheres,
isolated hollow-rods of ~100 nm in diameter were collected and investigated
by TEM and AFM. Two sets of crystalline plane, rutile (110) and (101), in the
skin of hollow-rods were resolved. As we stained the OPV3 packing domains of
the hollow-rods with RuO4, the rutile layer of the skin was rip off and the
stained inner layer of ~20 nm in diameter was clearly observed by TEM.
In combination of all experimental evidences, we proposed a cylinder with
a core-shell skin model to explain the formation of nano hollow-rods.
160
To prepare the precipitate powders, the final solution was spread on a Petri
dish and aged for 1 month as large amounts of products formed. Filtration and
evaporation of the residue solution were performed and finally we got solid
products then subjected them into SEM observation. TEM and HRTEM
samples were prepared by grinding the powders, suspending in methanol,
finally put onto a copper grid. For AFM observation, an automatically-flat mica
disk was dipped into the solution and maintained for 5 min. The deposited mica
was conditioned at ambient environment for 24 h, followed by thermal
annealing at 120 oC in vacuum oven for 24 h.
6.3. Results and Discussion
6.3.1. Microspheres formed by a PEO17-OPV3 / Titania Hybrid
SEM micrographs of the PEO17-OPV3/titania microspheres are shown in
Figure 6-1 ~ Figure 6-3. The size of these spheres is rather uniform with a
diameter of ~1μm and almost al of them have flaws.It should be noted that no
shear or other forces were imposed during sample preparation. Therefore, these
cracks should be created in association with the formation of microspheres.

bonds respectively. The 1100 and 1250 cm-1 peaks are the stretching modes of
C-O bonds. Indeed, the FT-IR results confirm that the hollow nano-rods are a
PEO17-OPV3/titania hybrid material.
6.3.3. Futher Study for the PEO17-OPV3 / Titania Nano-hollow Rods
To enhance the contrast of OPV3 portions, the samples were stained by
RuO4. Surprisingly, the stained rods are thinner (about 20 nm) and shorter than
the unstained samples (see Figures 6-9). It strongly suggested that RuO4 could
tear off the shell portion of the rods and remained the stained hollow cylinder
core with the external diameter of ~20 nm. Thus, a possible mechanism for the
assembly process to form the nano hollow-rods and their aggregating
microspheres is suggested as follows.
In Chapter 4, we have shown that PEO17-OPV3 molecules tended to form
a ring structure on the mica surface with the external diameter of ~30 nm. It is
because of the amphiphilic nature of PEO17-OPV3 and the twist of molecules in
between hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments (caused by the as-tetrahedral
shape of sulfonate linking group) that renders them to have only one side with
the same curvature to proceed the π-π stackingof conjugated OPV3 portions.
Therefore, we believe that as titania involved in the primary self-assembly of
164
To further approve our suggestion, we used TEM to check the shell region
of the nanorods. Figure 6-12 shows the HR-TEM image of titania/PEO17 shell
region in the skin of PEO17-OPV3/titania nano hollow-rod. Lattice images were
clearly observed, indicating that these PEO17-templated titania had high
crystallinity despite the small size. Two sets of crystalline planes were found,
rutile (110) and rutile (101). The d-spacing calculated by FFT pattern (see table
in Figure 6-12) was 0.325 nm for rutile (110) and 0.25 nm for rutile (101).
Rutile structure is a thermodynamically stable phase of TiO2 and usually
formed above 1200 oC. The anatase to rutile transformation occurs in the
temperature range of 700-1000 oC and the allowing temperature to grow
anatase crystal is 670-680oC [158-159]. In our case, however, all preparation
procedures were performed at low temperature. It indicated that our
amphiphilic molecule, PEO17-OPV3, could induce the crystallization of
titania even at low temperature. A similar case was also reported by Han and
his coworkers [160]. They used a triblock copolymer, Pluronic P-123
(PEO20PPO70PEO20), served as a surfactant to synthesize highly crystalline
TiO2 nanocrystals at room temperature.
Another work is to check the ring-packed pore structure. It is difficult to
get good images to make sure the exact structure due to the complexity in
166
should be a promising material for application on the photocatalysts and
organic solar cells. Further researches on these subjects are ongoing.
6.4. Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we have successfully developed a facile method to prepare
the PEO17-OPV3-templated titania microspheres of ~1 μm in diameter and the
nano hollow-rods of 100 nm in short axis. A cylinder with core-shell skin
model is proposed for the formation of nano hollow-rods. The π-π stackingof
conjugated OPV3 portions governs the formation of primary ring structure.
Further stacking of the ring structure to form a cylinder with the skin consisting
of the hydrophilic PEO17 and titania afforded the nano hollow-rods. Through
the final stage of polymerization among the Ti-OH dangling chains and
subsequent formation of TiO2 nano crystals, the adjacent nano hollow-rods
were aggregated together to form a microsphere. Because the core is a
photoharvest material and the shell is an electron-transporting material, the
fabricated PEO17-OPV3/titania nano hollow-rods and their aggregating
microspheres are believed to be a promising material for application on the
photocatalysts and organic solar cells. Besides, the PEO8-OPV3 / titania

nm in diameter are observed. By analyzing the width of enclosed region, it is
believed that π-π interaction drives the molecular packing. On the other
hand, in PEO8-OPV3 case, the final structures are highly dependent on
co-solvent ratios and deposited substrates. The basic structures are spherical-
(water overweighed system, tightly-packing) or cylindrical-like (THF
overweighed system, loosely-packing) core-shell assemblies of about 30 nm
in diameter and they will be deformed after substrate-deposited and solvent
evaporation. By tuning preparation conditions, such as co-solvent ratio or
deposited substrates could make morphology control achievable!!

fabricated. Ring-like thin disks of 150 nm in diameter and 0.65 nm in
thickness are found in PEO17-OPV3 /silica system. The thickness is
comparable to the width of OPV3 segment, so the molecular packing should
be driven by π-π interaction, which is similar to its neat system.
Multi-lamellae ring model is proposed to explain the formation mechanism.
Nano-islands of 100 nm in size are observed in PEO8-OPV3 /silica system.
By AFM analysis, the surfaces are rough and appeared to be assembled by
spherical-like assemblies which are the supramolecular architectures formed

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1. Introduction to Self-assembly and Supramolecular
Chemistry
In the 21st century, people want to make the smaller, more complex
machines with high quality and intense quantity. To this end, “these
machines cannot be built with current methods and they must almost
make themselves,”as G. M. Whitesides has said [1]. This method, which
is called “self-assembly,”is hard to define by what it is but easiest to
define by what it is not. In Whiteside’s view, a self-assembly process is
one in which humans are not actively involved, in which atoms,
molecules, aggregates of molecules and components arrange themselves
into ordered, functioning entities without human intervention. We people
could only design the process, launch it, but once under way it proceeds
according to its own internal plan, either toward an energetically stable
form or toward some systems whose form and function are encoded in its
parts [2-3].
Two types of self-assembly are classified [1]: thermodynamic
self-assembly and coded self-assembly. Most window glass is made by
floating molten glass on a pool of molten metal. The metal tends to
minimize its surface area by becoming smooth and flat; consequently, the
204
now, researchers are only beginning to understand the kinds of structures
and tasks that could exploit this approach.
To rationally design self-assembling machines, it should begin with
the ration design of self-assembling materials. During the past two
decades, one of the great challenges for materials sciences is the creation
of supramolecular materials in which the constituent units are highly
regular molecular nanostructures as shown in Figure 1-1 [4]. For organic
materials, such as amphiphilic (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic) block
copolymers, they can self-organize into different types of supramolecular
architectures under proper conditions as shown in Figure 1-2 [5].
Figure 1-1 Supramolecular nanostructures with well-defined shapes and sizes
[4].
It is believed that learning how to create large supramolecular units,
and the elucidation of rules mediating their macroscopic organization into
206
π-conjugated systems) which has attracted much attention during the past
ten years. The following introduction in Section 1.2 will focus on the
main research groups in this field and discuss their recent results, so as to
find out something that could inspire our work.
1.2. Introduction to Self-assembly and Supramolecular
Assemblies ofπ-Conjugated Systems
1.2.1. Self-assembly Principles ofπ-Conjugated Systems
π-conjugated polymers are the most promising materials for
applications in less expensive and flexible electronic devices. The basic
structures of these semi-conducting polymers are listed in Figure 1-3 [11].
They have been fabricated into light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [12-13],
field-effect transistors (FETs) [14], and photovoltaic cells [15]. The
performance of molecular devices is determined by the chemical
structures, purity, and the supramolecular structures (see Figure 1-4) of
the π-conjugated molecules [11]. Thus, controlling their supramolecular
architectures is by far the most delicate work for semi-conducting
polymers.
208
π-conjugated molecules. Hunter and Sanders have developed a practical
model for π-π interactions[17]. In their model, which is entirely
electrostatic, three point charges are assigned to the atoms in an aromatic
molecule, one at the site of the atom (often a positively charged carbon
atom) and one above and below the plane of theπsystem (πpoint charges
of -1/2 each) (as shown in Figure 1-5). One of the important outcomes of
this model is that geometries different from face-to-face have hardly been
recognized in the design of supramolecular architectures.

abundant [19-59]. In general view, some factors evidently affect the
micro-phase separation: the Flory-Huggins χparameter, the volume
fraction of the constituent blocks, and the degree of polymerization.
Segregation product, χN, is often adapted to determine the degree of the
micro-phase separation. Higher the χN value, microphase separation is
more severe. By introducing π-conjugated rigid segments into block
copolymers, rod-coil block copolymers could be obtained. The
self-assembly behavior and the associated supramolecular structures
would be affected not only by previous factors but by the aggregation of
π-conjugated rigid segments. Besides, the stiffness and asymmetry of
rod-coil block copolymers would result in the increase in χparameter.
Thus, even in low molecular weight oligomer systems (consisting of
π-conjugated rigid segments), micro-phase separation could exactly occur.
While a non-solvent for one block is chosen, the final supramolecular
architecture would have been decided.
1.2.2. Literature Survey for Self-assembly ofπ-Conjugated Systems
During the past decade, molecular packing and self-assembly of
conjugated polymers and oligomers have interested many research groups
all over the world due to the versatile applications in optoelectronic
devices [60-73]. Among them, Stupp [74-79] and Meijer [80-97] groups
are the most active and have already obtained many results and derived
many reasonable theories forπ-conjugated systems.

0.35 (upper left), 0.20 (upper right), 0.30 (down). [74].
Stupp reported in 1999 [75] on synthesis and characterization of
several triblock rod-coil molecules consisting of blocks of oligostyrene,
oligoisoprene, and a rigid rod block (as shown in Figure 1-8). These
molecules contain conformationally rigid and flexible sequences and
luminescent chromophores based on phenylene vinylene. By electron
microscopy and X-ray diffraction results, it was found that these systems
could self-organize into supramolecular nanostructures which in turn
assemble into monolayers. The nanostructures have diameters between

with nano-scale dimensions. The strips are 8 nm in width and approximately 80
nm in length (left). (Right) Molecular graphics model showing the herringbone
packing of the phenylene vinylene oligomeric rods. [75].
In 2004 [76], Stupp and co-workers synthesized a series of three
molecules with dendron rod-coil architecture that contain conjugated
segments of oligo(thiophene), oligo(phenylene-vinylene), and
oligo(phenylene) as shown in Figure 1-10. Atomic force microscopy
revealed self-assembly of the molecules into high aspect ratio ribbon-like
nanostructures (see Figure 1-11) which at low concentrations induce
gelation in nonpolar solvent. The assembly of these molecules into
one-dimensional nanostructures is a route to π-πstacked supramolecular
polymers for organic electronic functions. In the oligo(thiophene)
derivative, self-assembly leaded to a 3 orders of magnitude increase in the
conductivity of iodine-doped films due to self-assembly. Besides, they
also found that electric field alignment of these supramolecular

the gold electrode begins on the substrate. Ribbons are aligned in the gap. [76].
The same group reported the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic
molecules consisting of oligo(phenylene vinylene) (OPV) asymmetrically
end-substituted with a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segment
and a hydrophobic alkyl chain [77]. This amphiphilic structure induces
self-assembly into both thermotropic and lyotropic lamellar liquid
crystalline (LC) phases as shown in Figure 1-12. These self assembled
structures have been characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS, see Figure 1-13). Photoluminescence (PL) is influenced by the
structure of the material, with enhanced emission in the LC state due to
assembly of the chromophore in confined two-dimensional layers (see
Figure 1-14).

In 2005 [78], Stupp reported the use of enantiomerically enriched
self-assembling molecules to create one-dimensional nanostructures with
well-defined chiral structure. The stereocenter at carbon 3 of the
dimethyloctyl coil is enantiomerically enriched. DRC nanostructures cast

surface, indicating that interactions with the substrate can also play an
important role in the chain-packing in the solid. When deposits were
prepared on the surface of a silicon wafer, thin fibrils were also formed,
but they present a helical shape (Figure 1-17c), which is a clear signature
of the chirality of the assemblies.

In 2003, Meijer group [85] synthesized a series of
oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) dimers, tetramers and hexamers (see
Figure 1-18) and observed their organization into highly organized 2D
crystals on graphite by spontaneous self-assembly. The unit cell

In 2004, Meijer reported a review which presented different
complementary approaches for the control of molecular assembly into
well-defined structures on the nano-scale, oligothiophenes (as shown in
Figure 1-22) as a typical conjugated system [86]. They considered
self-assembly in solution, sublimation of individual molecules in the
vapor phase, and aggregation in thin deposits from compounds
molecularly dispersed in a solution. They demonstrated that the
development of substituted, soluble π-conjugated materials allows not
only a control of their organization in the solid state but also the
possibility of determining the degree of order in solution. During these
self-assembly processes, the interplay among the conjugated molecules,
the solvent, and the substrate surface is of primary importance.
Depending on the interactions between the molecules and the substrate,
two-dimensional (platelets, see Figure 1-23, 1-24) or one-dimensional
(nanowires, see Figure 1-25) objects can be generated.

(2.5 x 2.5 μm2). Only 3b shows left-handed helical aggregates. [86].
PPV-series oligomer systems were also investigated by Meijer and
his coworkers. They reported in 2004 [87] an interesting case of a
gelation-assisted helix transition during the hierarchical self-assembly of
a rigid π-conjugated system (see Figure 1-26) to form coiled-coil helical
ropes. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of
C-OPV1 from a dilute solution in dodecane showed left-handed helical
fibers of 20–50 nm in diameter and a few micrometers in length with an
uniform helical pitch of approximately 150 nm (Figure 1-27a). However,
the FESEM image of C-OPV1 (partially gelled) from a more
concentrated solution in dodecane showed the formation of left-handed
coiled-coil ropelike structures of 50–100 nm in diameter with an average
pitch of 330 nm. These ropelike structures were formed by the twisting
together of several helical fibers (Figure 1-27b). AFM analysis of the
C-OPV1 gel from dodecane clearly showed the formation of entangled

main plot at different temperatures, but just within the range 24–35oC. [87].
Fluorene-based diblock and triblock copolymers (Figure 1-31) were
also studied by Meijer [88]. Figure 1-32 illustrates the typical results
obtained on different oligofluorene-based systems. The AFM images of
thin deposits of these compounds showed a typical morphology: fibrils as
long bright objects lying flat on the mica substrate. The AFM technique
thus provided an extremely detailed description of the microscopic
morphology of the material under study, but usually it did not allow to
distinguish individual molecules or polymer chains. Therefore, in order to
understand how those were formed from molecularly dissolved solutions
and how the molecules were packed within the supramolecular
organizations leading to the observed morphologies, models of the chain
assembly can be proposed, using a theoretical approach based on
molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.
Molecular mechanics is a theoretical approach developed to provide
information on the structure of large molecules such as proteins and
polymers. It is based on empirical force fields, optimized to reproduce
molecular potential energy surfaces. The energy of a molecule is usually
written as a superposition of various two-body, three-body, and four-body
interactions; it is expressed as a sum of bonded interactions (consisting of
bond stretching, bond angle bending, torsion, and inversion terms) and
nonbonded interactions (consisting of van der Waals and electrostatic
terms). Authors presented the case of a diblock copolymer made of eight
9, 9’-dioctylfluorene units and eight ethylene oxide units (F8-b-EO8,
Figure 1-33). The width of these structures appears to be constant, about

Chapter 3 Results and Discussion
3.1. Molecular Packing in Solutions
In this section, we used the optical techniques including UV-vis and
photoluminescent spectroscopies to investigate the molecular packing and
aggregation behaviors of π-conjugated molecules in solutions by
following the techniques published in the literature [60, 76-77]. Hexane,
decane, and chloroform were chosen as a solvent. Under diluted condition,
the π-conjugated molecules except chloroform could be assumed
molecularly dispersed in the solution and emit light reflected their
original photo-physical centers. However, as concentration increases, the
π-conjugated molecules tend to aggregate with each other so that the
exciplexes might be formed. Thus, PL technique could be applied to
investigate the formation of supramolecular architectures.
3.1.1. Optical Absorption Properties in Solutions
We investigated the absorption and fluorescence behaviors in
relation to molecular aggregation or packing of OBHPV3 and OBHPV4
in solutions and also studied their associated solvent effects. For
OBHPV3 system in hexane and decane, we could first see the emitting
color changing with the concentrations (see Figures 3-1 and 3-2). For the
most concentrated solution, it showed yellow-green and the colors
changed to light-green (just a little transparent) with decreasing
258
concentrations (see Figure 3-14, 3-16, and 3-18).
3.1.2. Luminescence Properties in the solutions
Light-emitting behaviors in relation to molecular aggregation or
packing of OBHPV3 and OBHPV4 were also investigated. For OBHPV3
system in hexane (see Figure 3-19), the emission at 487 nm was dominant
in dilute solution that was believed to be attributed to the molecularly
dispersed emission. With increasing concentration, the main peak was
shifted to 522 nm (over ~ 3 x 10-5 M) a little higher than the origin peak
at 519 nm as a result of the formation of excimers [96]. Besides, a
shoulder peak also appeared at 564 nm which was believed to be due to
the formation of supramolecular structures. As Figure 3-19 was
normalized at 487 nm (see Figure 3-20), the intensities at 519 and 564 nm
increased with increasing concentration. From the plots of relative
intensities (see Figure 3-21), two-step slopes for the increase of relative
intensities were found. In diluted concentrations, the plots increased
gradually with increasing concentrations. As the concentration was above
~ 3 x 10-5 M, the plots tended to stay flat. Next, we defined the equivalent
intensity Ieq as I/I0C, where I was the measured peak intensity at the
concentration C and I0 was the intensity at the most diluted concentration
(~ 1.056 x 10-6 M). The equivalent intensities Ieq for three emitting peaks
at 487, 522 and 564 nm versus concentrations were estimated. Less than
~ 3 x 10-5 M (see Figure 3-22), the values decreased rapidly with
increasing concentrations, but the slope tended to level off as the
260
equivalent intensity Ieq (see Figure 3-30).
For OBHPV4 system, the emission behavior was similar to those of
OBHPV3 in hexane and decane solutions. The emission peaks in hexane
were 502, 535 (over ~ 3 x 10-5 M), and 581 nm (see Figures 3-31 and
3-32). The transition point was at 3 x 10-5 M (see Figures 3-33 and 3-34).
The emission peaks in decane were 504, 540 (over ~ 3 x 10-6 M), and 585
nm (see Figures 3-35 and 3-36). The transition point was at 3 x 10-6 M
(see Figures 3-37 and 3-38).
However in chloroform, only one emission peak at 584 nm was
observed even at very low concentration (see Figure 3-39).

with the average diameters ranging from 200 to 400 nm deposited from a
solution of OBHPV3 in hexane at a concentration of 1.065 x 10-6 M.
Further increase of the concentration (1.065 x 10-5 M) resulted in two
kinds of aggregated features (see Figure 3-42). Larger particles were also
found, but wire-like structures were formed at this concentration.
However, their contours were not very distinct. The width of wires was
about 20 ~ 30 nm. However, when we raised the concentration to 1.065 x
10-4 M, another different texture was found (see Figure 3-43). The
architectures in concentrated solution could be self-assembled into
elongated but short rods of 20 ~ 50 nm in width and 100 ~ 200 nm in
length. In larger magnification, tube-like features with the external
diameter of ~ 30 nm and height of ~ 2.8 nm (see Figure 3-45), as crooked
as water pipes, were distinctly observed (see Figure 3-44). It was difficult
to determine the exact length of the tube-like aggregates because the
exact structures could not be identified in most of the aggregates.
3.2.2. Solid-state Self-assembly from OBHPV3 in Decane
Figure 3-47 showed the AFM image of OBHPV3 domains with
diameters ranging from 20 to 50 nm precipitated on mica from a solution
of OBHPV3 in decane at a concentration of 1.065 x 10-6 M. Further
increase of the concentration to 1.065 x 10-5 M resulted in well-defined
fiber-like structures (see Figure 3-48). The width of fibers was about 40
nm (see Figures 3-49 and 3-50), the height was about ~ 2.5 nm, and
several micrometers in length (see Figures 3-51 and 3-52). TEM image
284
individually appeared but could aggregate into larger laurel wreaths with
several micro-meters (see Figures 3-62 and 3-63). However, as we raised
the concentration to 1.023 x 10-4 M, the thin needle domains turned to
aggregate into wider, thicker but shorter flake-shape domains with 80 ~
100 nm in width, ~ 2 nm in thickness and 150 ~ 200 nm in length (see
Figure 3-64). These flake domains would further aggregate into elongated
ropes with 80 ~ 100 nm in width and ~ 4 nm in height (see Figure 3-65).
The TEM investigation also confirmed these textures. Each flake might
be composed of two stacked layer of packing molecules, whereas each
rope-like texture might be self-assembled from stacking of those flakes
(see Figure 3-66). The self-assembled ropes could also form thicker rings.
Unlike the laurel wreaths formed in 10-5 M, those formed at 10-4 M could
be fused into larger and denser rings with a diameter of several
micro-meters and a peripheral width of ~ 200 nm (see Figure 3-67).
3.2.4. Solid-state Self-assembly from OBHPV4 in Hexane
Figure 3-69 showed the AFM image of OBHPV4 deposited from
hexane solution at a concentration of 1.056 x 10-6 M. Wormlike textures
and larger particles were observed. When the concentration was increased
to 1.056 x 10-5 M, many small particles were observed with an average
diameter of 40 ~ 60 nm (see Figure 3-70). Interestingly, high
magnification revealed that the OBHPV4 molecules had aggregated into
a vesicular texture with ~ 56 nm in diameter and 2.23 nm in height
aggregated by OBHPV4 (see Figures 3-71 and 3-72). In addition, most of
286
the inside of domain has the height variation of ~1.2 nm. Some vesicles
located outside of domains have the height of ~5 nm (see Figure 3-83).
Accordingly, we considered that the skin of the vesicles consisted of the
double layers of packing OBHPV4 molecules (see Figure 3-82).
3.2.7. The Overall discussion
We concluded all the textures observed from the AFM and TEM in
Tables 3.3 and 3.4.

In general, three kinds of forces were involved for aggregation of
OBHPV3 and OBHPV4 molecules: hydrogen bonding,π-πstacking, and
Van der Waal interaction. The self-assembled features of OBHPV3 in
these three solvents were easier to form fiber-like or rope-like
supramolecules and OBHPV4 molecules liked to form vesicular texture.
The driving force for OBHPV3 molecules to packing into sheet-like
textures in hexane was π-πinteraction and hydrogen bonding (see Figure
3-46). Because these sheets were too thin, they would roll up into tubes in
order to overcome the surface energy. For OBHPV4 in hexane, distinct
vesicular textures were found instead tubes. It might be due to the fact
that the tert-butyl group of OBHPV4 could rotate during packing (see
Figure 3-73).
Similar to the packing of OBHPV3 molecules to tubes in hexane,
