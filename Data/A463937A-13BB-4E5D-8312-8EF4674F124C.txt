2. THE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL 
Following the work by Duncan and 
Chang (1970) and Vaid (1985), the nonlinear 
part of the relationship of deviator stress and 
strain can be expressed as 
df

i
d R
E σ
ε
εσ
Δ+
=Δ

,                  (1) 
where dσΔ  is the increment of deviator 
stress beyond the 0K  state, dσΔ = dσ - 0dσ ; 
dσ  is the deviator stress, dσ = 31 σσ −  
where 1σ and 3σ  denote the major and mi-
nor principal stresses, respectively; 0dσ  is 
the deviator stress at the 0K  state; dfσΔ  is 
the increment of deviator stress at the failure 
state beyond the 0K  state; dfσΔ = dfσ - 0dσ  
where dfσ  is the deviator stress at the fail-
ure state; iE  is the initial Young’s modulus; 
fR  is the failure ratio, fR = dudf σσ ΔΔ / ; 
duσΔ  is the increment of deviator stress at 
the ultimate state beyond the 0K  state, 
duσΔ = duσ - 0dσ  where duσ  is the deviator 
stress at the ultimate state ; ε is the strain. 
Differentiating Equation (1) with re-
spect to strain, the tangent Young’s modulus 
(Et) can be derived as 
2)1( SLREE fit −= ,                  (2) 
where SL is the stress level, SL= dfd σσ ΔΔ / . 
Since soil usually exhibits high stiffness 
at small strain and its behavior is that of line-
arly elastic response (e.g., Jardine 1992, Shi-
buya and Mitachi 1997, Ng et al. 2000, Kung 
and Ou 2004), an elastic surface, ES , is 
constructed to represent the linearly elastic 
response for the state of stress within the 
elastic surface. The elastic surface on the q-V 
coordinate is expressed as

VqqES σ ,           (3) 
where q  is the normalized deviator stress 
on the x-y plane, q = [( yσ - xσ )/2]/suc; yσ  
is the vertical total stress; xσ is the horizon-
tal total stress; suc is the undrained shear 
strength obtained from the triaxial 
ACUCK −0  test; V is the normalized shear 
stress in the x-y plane, V=τ /suc; τ is the 
shear stress on the x-y plane; 0q is the 
q-value at the K0 condition; diσΔ  is the in-
crement of deviator stress beyond the 0K  
state that corresponds to the threshold value 
of the elasto-plastic response or initial yield 
strain in the triaxial loading condition, 
diσΔ = diσ - 0dσ = iiE ε ; iε is the threshold 
value of the small strain or initial yield strain; 
diσ  is the deviator stress corresponding to 
initial yield strain. 
Therefore, when the state of stress is 
within the elastic surface, i.e., ( q - 0q )
2+ 2V  
≤  [( diσΔ /2)/ ucs ]2, its behavior is linearly 
elastic and its Young’s modulus is treated as 
the initial Young’s modulus ( iE ) or the 
maximum elastic Young’s modulus, max,eE . 
When the state of stress exceeds the elastic 
surface, the soil is in the primary state and its 
behavior is elastoplastic. Figure 1 shows the 
relationship of deviator stress and strain, in-
cluding the small strain response, from the Ko 
state to the initial yield state, and elastoplas-
tic response, from the initial yield state to the 
failure state.

describe the stress-strain relationship. 
 
On the other hand, when the state of 
stress exceeds the elastic surface, the elastic 
Young’s modulus, eE , degrades with the in-
creasing stress level ( SL ) (Wood 1990). 
Figure 2 shows the schematic representation 
of the degradation of eE  and its relation to 
the tangent Young’s modulus. In the USC 
model, the degraded Young’s modulus is as-

where fq  is the q  value at the failure 
condition; cq  is the q  value at the center 
of the failure surface, qc=(1-Ks)/2; sK  is the 
anisotropic undrained strength ratio, sK = 
ues / ucs ; ues  is the undrained shear strength 
from the AEUCK −0 test; fV  is the V  
value at the failure condition; R is the radius 
of the failure surface, R= 
[(3Ks+1)(Ks+3)/12]1/2; SL is the stress level at 
the current stress state; and SLR  is the ra-
dius of the yield surface. 
Figure 4 shows the relationship between 
the elastic surface, yield surface and failure 
surface. 
 
Figure 4. Relationship among elastic surface, 
yield surface and failure surface. 
 
The stress level corresponding to the 
current stress state (q, V) can then be deter-
mined by substituting the current stress state 
(q, V) into Equation (8). Note that the stress 
level as defined in the original hyperbolic 
model is a special case of the new definition 
of stress level for 0K =1. For the stress paths 
of axial undrained compression tests and ax-
ial extension tests, the new stress level defi-
nition gives the same results as those pro-
posed by Vaid (1985). 
In the analysis, when the state of stress 
is within the elastic surface, i.e., 
( q - 0q )
2+ 2V ≤  [( diσΔ /2)/ ucs ]2, the Young’s 
modulus (Ei) at small strain should be used, 
i.e., iEE = . When the state of stress is out-
side of the elastic surface, i.e., ( q - 0q )
2+ 2V  
> [( diσΔ /2)/ ucs ]2, and the current stress level, 
currentSL , is smaller than the past maximum 
stress level, max,pastSL , the soil is in the 
unloading/reloading state where the unload-
ing/reloading Young’s modulus ( urE ) or the 
elastic Young’s modulus, eE ,  at the current 
stress state should be employed. When the 
state of stress is on the yield surface and 
currentSL = max,pastSL , the tangent Young’s 
modulus (Et) should be used. 
Furthermore, dfσΔ  in Equation (1), or 
the undrained shear strength, often varies 
with the principal rotation. Therefore, it is 
necessary to take the strength anisotropy into 
account when the state of stress reaches the 
failure condition. In the USC model, the 
undrained shear strength ( psus −β ) in the di-
rection of β , under the plane strain condi-
tion, can be estimated by the following equa-
tion, which was derived by Hsieh et al. 
(2008): 
ucccpsu sqqRs ]2cos)2sin([
22 βββ +−=− (9) 
where β is the angle between the major prin-
cipal direction and the vertical direction. 
A total of seven parameters are required 
for the USC model to describe the undrained 
soft clay model, that is, ucs , iE , εi, fR , and 
sK ,as well as m and n. Of these, ucs  and fR  
are exactly the same as those in the original 
Duncan-Chang model. iE  can be obtained 
from small strain tests, bender element tests 
or empirical correlations and εi from small 
strain tests or empirical correlations. Based 
on Jardine (1992), εi is between 10-3%~10-5%. 
sK  is obtained from triaxial compression 
tests and extension tests. m and n can be ob-
tained from multiple unloading-reloading 
tests.  
 
3. CALIBRATION 
A TNEC (Taipei National Enterprise 
Center) excavation case is examined the 
characteristics and rationality of the model 
when it is applied to the actual problem. In 
the TNEC case history (Ou et al. 1998), 
many types of soil tests, such as small strain 
tests, triaxial ACUCK −0  and AEUCK −0  
tests and multiple unloading-reloading tests

3.4 Analysis results and discussions 
The finite element analysis is performed 
following the construction sequence shown 
in Figure 5. Figure 7 shows the wall deflec-
tions and surface settlements computed using 
the USC model with those from field obser-
vation for stages 3, 4, 6 and 7. The computed 
wall deflections for these stages agree well 
with the field observations. The computed 
maximum wall deflection is almost the same 
as that observed for stages 3 and 4, while the 
computed maximum wall deflection at stage 
7, which is equal to 11.1 cm, is slightly larger 
than the observed one, which is 10.6 cm. 
Moreover, the development of the wall de-
flection shape with the construction sequence 
and the location of the maximum wall de-
flection computed from the model are also 
very close to those from field observation. 
The computed surface settlements are also in 
good agreement with the observed settle-
ments. The location of the maximum surface 
settlement computed from the model is al-
most the same as that from field observation. 
However, the computed maximum surface 
settlement at stage 7 is slightly less than that 
of the observed settlement. The USC model 
predicts both wall deflection and surface set-
tlement well. 
 
Figure 7. Comparison of the wall deflections 
and surface settlements from field observa-
tion and those from analysis using the USC 
model for the TNEC case. 
 
For comparison, analysis of the TNEC 
case using the USC model without consider-
ing stiffness degradation is also executed. 
The parameters used in the analysis are ex-
actly the same as those listed in Tables 1 
through 3. The comparison of the wall de-
flections and surface settlements for stages 4 
and 7 are presented in Figure 8. Both the wall 
deflections and surface settlements for these 
stages are much smaller than the field obser-
vations. The initial Young’s moduli, ui sE / , 
are overestimated. 
To investigate the effect of the new 
definition of stress level in the USC model 
on the prediction, analysis using the original 
Duncan-Chang model, where the stress level 
is defined by principal stress difference, was 
also conducted. Because the USC model 
considers both the high stiffness at small 
strain and stiffness degradation with stress 
level, the initial Young’s modulus, ui sE / , 
should be estimated from the bender element 
test or from the stress strain relationship at a 
 8
indicated by point D to E in Figure 11(b). 
The Young’s modulus evaluated from the 
model is virtually equal to the unload-
ing/reloading Young’s modulus. When ex-
cavation advances to stages 3 to 5, removal 
of the soil in the excavation zone will cause 
the principal stress rotation, i.e., 1σ = xσ  
and 3σ = yσ , as shown in Figure 9. The soil 
is subject to the reloading condition, follow-
ing the unloading-reloading line as indicated 
by point E to D. The Young’s modulus 
evaluated from the model is also equal to the 
unloading/reloading Young’s modulus, as 
shown in Figure 10. When excavation goes 
to stage 6, Young’s modulus jumps to a small 
value, which is inconsistent with the me-
chanical behavior of soil. This result occurs 
because the deviatoric stress, 31 σσ − , at this 
stage is larger than the previous maximum 
deviator stress, which causes the state of 
stress to move beyond point D toward point 
F. The Duncan-Chang model yields unrea-
sonable and inconsistent mechanical behav-
ior for the soil in the excavation zone. 
 
Figure 11. The stress strain relationship un-
der the undrained loading condition: (a) K0 
consolidation and (b) isotropic consolidation. 
On the other hand, the soil outside the 
excavation zone, far from the diaphragm wall, 
should be subject to lateral unloading. The 
USC model causes the soil to stay in the pri-
mary loading state, as indicated by point A to 
C in Figure 11(a). On the contrary, the Dun-
can-Chang model induces the soil to move 
from the initial state, point D in Figure 11(b), 
to point F. The Young’s modulus at point D 
( tE ) in Figure 11(b) is much smaller than 
that at point A ( iE ) in Figure 11(a), which 
causes the soil far from the diaphragm wall 
to have larger vertical settlement. 
In many Asian countries, like Japan and 
Taiwan, the basal heave of an excavation is 
analyzed with the assumption that the critical 
circular surface is centered at the lowest level 
of strut and passes the toe level of the dia-
phragm wall. The safety factor of the basal 
heave is defined as the ratio of the resisting 
moment, provided by the undrained shear 
strength along the critical circle, to the driv-
ing moment, induced by the weight of soil 
outside the wall (Hsieh et al. 2008). There-
fore, the undrained shear strength along the 
critical circle, as shown in Figure 12, is ex-
amined to study the rationality of the 
undrained shear strength predicted by the 
USC model.

the critical circle adopted for basal heave 
analysis.

ments 1 to 9, along the critical circle relative
