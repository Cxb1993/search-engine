ABSTRACT 
This research determined the rate constant between 2,6-dimethy-aniline (2,6-DMA) 
and hydroxyl radicals (OH•) by using Fenton reaction and competitive kinetics technique. 
Regardless of experimental conditions either batch or continuous mode, presence or 
absence of media, complete suspension or fluidized-bed reactor, the intrinsic 2nd-order rate 
constant between 2,6-DMA and OH• were found to be consistent in between 1.59×1010 and 
1.80×1010 M-1sec-1 with the average and 95% confidence interval of 1.70±0.04×1010 M-
1sec-1. Aromatic intermediates from 2,6-DMA oxidation by OH• were 2,6-dimethyl-
nitrobenzene, 2,6-dimethy-phenol, 2,6-dimethyl-nitrophenol, 2,6-dimethyl-hydroquinone, 
2,6-dimethyl-benzoquinone, and 2,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-benzoquinone indicating the 
methyl groups on the benzene ring were less susceptible to OH• attack than the amino and 
hydroxide groups. Maleic, lactic, oxalic, acetic, and formic acids were also identified as the 
carboxylic intermediates. Degradation mechanism of 2,6-DMA oxidation by OH• was also 
proposed. 
Considering iron crystallization, it was found that ferrous (Fe2+) was immediately 
transformed to ferric (Fe3+) after the initiation of Fenton reaction and sequentially 
precipitated out in the form of Fe(OH)3 due to its low solubility even in the acidic solution. 
However, if precipitation occurred in the labile zone, Fe(OH)3 was formed via 
homogeneous nucleation and crystallized very slowly onto the fluidized media. On the 
other hand, if it happened in the metastable zone, Fe(OH)3 crystallized onto the fluidized 
media more rapidly via heterogeneous nucleation and iron was removed significantly from 
the aqueous phase. Crystallization was controlled by the transport step rather than the 
surface interaction step. Rate of crystal growth followed the orthokinetic flocculation when 
the mixing was sufficiently provided; however, it became under the influence of molecular 
diffusion or perikinetic flocculation depending on the crystallite size under the stagnant 
conditions. Presence of organic intermediates which could form complex with Fe3+ 
increased the solubility of Fe3+ and sequentially deteriorated the crystallization process. 
Crystallization rate onto fluidized media decreased with time; thus, continuously replace 
certain portion of coated solids with fresh media will maintain satisfactory crystallization 
rate. Catalytic activity of the Fe(OH)3-coated sand with 3.5% iron content by weight was 
only equivalent to 4% of the goethite.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1 Research Rationale 
 
Nowadays, several chemicals which are highly persistent in the environment 
have been synthesized and used intensively and become hazardous wastes afterward. 
These chemicals cannot be degraded by traditional treatment processes due to their 
toxic and refractory property. Variation in the chemical composition leads to a need to 
develop a special and specific treatment method for each persistent pollutant. One 
group of the pollutants that is typically persistent and needs advanced treatment is the 
aromatic compounds. 
2,6-dimethyl-aniline (2,6-DMA) is a metabolite of the xylidine group of 
anesthetics including lidocaine and can also be produced by the reduction of certain 
azo dyes by intestinal microflora. It may also enter the environment through 
degradation of certain pesticides. 2,6-DMA has been commercially produced and 
widely used as a chemical intermediate to produce many products such as pesticides, 
dyestuffs, antioxidants, pharmaceuticals and other products. 2,6-DMA-contaminated 
wastewaters from these manufacturers can pose adverse impacts in receiving waters 
due to its biorefractory and highly toxic properties. 2,6-DMA has been classified by 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as group 2B carcinogens. As a 
result, appropriate and effective treatment technologies are needed to purify or clean 
up these contaminated wastewaters prior to discharge to the environment. 
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are one of the possible alternatives 
which can provide the destruction of refractory and hazardous organic compounds. 
Hydroxyl radicals (OH•), generated in the AOPs, are extremely reactive, short lived 
and unselective transient species which can readily oxidize organic/inorganic 
pollutants in water and wastewater and convert them into simple, relatively harmless 
substances.  A number of methods can lead to the generation of OH• including 
 3
1.2 Objectives 
 
The main objectives of this study are: 
1. To characterize the kinetics of 2,6-DMA oxidation by OH• using Fenton 
and fluidized-bed Fenton processes. 
2. To characterize the iron precipitation and crystallization in the fluidized-
bed Fenton process. 
The first objective led to the determination of the intrinsic kinetic rate constant 
between 2,6-DMA and OH• and the oxidation pathway of 2,6-DMA. The second 
objective provided the fundamental understanding on the characteristics of iron 
crystallization onto the carrier’s surface in the fluidized-bed Fenton process as well as 
the catalytic ability of iron-coated media on H2O2 decomposition to generate OH•.  
 
1.3 Hypotheses 
 
1. Oxidation of 2,6-DMA by OH• is a second-order reaction. 
2. 2,6-Dimethyl-aniline decomposition by ordinary and fluidized-bed Fenton 
processes depends on system pH and chemical dosages. 
3. Metal oxide can effectively serve as a medium for iron crystallization in 
the fluidized-bed Fenton process. 
4. Iron concentration as well as 2,6-DMA and its intermediates have an effect 
on iron crystallization in fluidized-bed Fenton process. 
 
1.4 Scope of the Research 
 
1. Using lab scale reactors of 1.35 liter for the fluidized-bed Fenton and 0.5 
liter for the ordinary Fenton. 
2. Using a synthetic wastewater. 
3. For the fluidized-bed Fenton process, the carriers were either silica dioxide, 
aluminum oxide, or construction sand. 
4. Working at 25°C under room condition. 
5. Operating in both batch and continuous modes.

CHAPTER II  
THEORIES AND LITERATURE REVIEWS 
 
 
2.1 2,6-Dimethyl-aniline 
 
 2.1.1 General Information 
 
2,6-dimethyl-aniline (2,6-DMA) is one of the six dimethyl-aniline isomers of 
which their molecular formula are (CH3)2C6H3NH2. 2,6-dimethyl-aniline has two 
methyl groups positioned on both sides of the amino group on the benzene ring (at 
both ortho-positions) as shown in Figure 2.1. 2,6-dimethyl-aniline can be either 
obtained as a by-product in the fractional distillation of the coal tar or synthesized by 
heating aniline hydrochloride with methanol at 220 °C. Furthermore, 2.6-DMA is a 
metabolite of the xylidine group of anaesthetics including lidicaine and is produced by 
the reduction of certain azo dyes by intestinal microflora. It may also enter the 
environment through degradation of certain pesticides. 2,6-dimethyl-aniline is an 
aniline homologue and has similar properties of aromatic amine. 2,6-dimethyl-aniline 
is sparingly soluble in water but miscible with ethanol and diethyl ether and is 
sensitive to air and light and tends to darken on storage. 2,6-dimethyl-aniline is used 
to manufacture many products including pesticides, dyestuffs, antioxidants, 
pharmaceuticals and other products. 
2,6-dimethyl-aniline damages hemoglobin, a protein that normally transports 
oxygen in the blood, so that oxygen cannot be transported to cells and tissues causing 
them to lack oxygen for their metabolisms. This condition is known as 
“methemoglobinemia”. Methaemoglobinemia causes headache, cardiac arrhythmia, 
blood pressure drop, dyspnoea, spasms, and cyanosis (blue coloration of the blood). 
Sensitization with allergic manifestations in predisposed persons. Direct contact with 
2,6-DMA can also produce skin and eye irritation. 2,6-dimethyl-aniline is released 
into the environmental primarily from industrial uses, and may cause long-term 
adverse effects in the aquatic environment (NTP, 2002).

and symptoms of exposure may include photophobia, visual disturbances, sluggish 
pupillary reaction, tinnitus, speech disturbances, anorexia, nausea, colicky pain, 
muscle pain, faintness, paresthesias of the extremities, tremor, seizures, 
cardiacarrhythmias, tachycardia, and heart block. Urinary signs and symptoms may 
include painful micturition, hemoglobinuria, methemoglobinuria, hematuria, oliguria,

health effects, a Heinz-body hemolytic crisis may follow the development of 
methemoglobinemia. Heart, kidney, and liver damage may occur, possibly as 
secondary effects of hemolysis (NTP, 2002). In addition, 2,6-DMA may also cause 
mutagenic effects for bacteria and/or yeast; however, there is currently no solid 
evidence that 2,6-DMA is human mutagen. 2,6-DMA has been classified as group 2B 
carcinogens (possible for human) by International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC). 
 
2.1.4 First Aid Measures 
 
 9
Fenton’s reagent was discovered in 1894 by its inventor Henry J. Fenton, but 
its application as an oxidizing process for destroying toxic organics was applied in the 
late 1960s (Huang et al., 1993). Fenton reaction is one kind of AOPs used to generate 
OH• for degradation of pollutants. This reaction involves chemical reagents called 
“Fenton’s reagent”, which are the combination of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and a 
ferrous ion (Fe2+). Fenton’s reagent is an effective and simple oxidant of various types 
of organic contaminants. 
 
2.3.1 Hydrogen Peroxide 
 
Hydrogen peroxide is an aqueous solution which has clear, colorless, water-
like in appearance, and can be mixed with water in any proportion. It is miscible with 
cold water and is soluble in alcohol and ether. At high concentration, it has a slightly 
pungent or acidic odor. The chemical formula is H2O2 and it has a molecular weight 
of 34.015 g/mole and is non-flammable at any concentrations. Hydrogen peroxide is a 
diprotic acid with KA1 and KA2 equal to 10-11.8 and <10-14, respectively. 
Although pure H2O2 is fairly stable, it significantly decomposed into water and 
oxygen when heated above about 60°C or in the presence of reducing agents. 
Aqueous solution of H2O2 is mainly used for oxidation reactions, including bleaching 
process, chemical syntheses, and for water and wastewater treatment. In drinking 
water purification, Hydrogen peroxide is used to pre-oxidized organic constituents 
and to eliminate iron and manganese ions. Furthermore, by dissociation into oxygen 
and water, H2O2 can also supply oxygen to microorganism in biological treatment 
facilities and in the bioremediation of contaminated sites. It can be used as a 
disinfecting agent in the control of undesirable biofilm growth. Since the oxygen 
concentration is generally limiting factor during the in-situ biodegradation of organic 
contaminants, many applications using injection of H2O2 into the subsurface have 
been successfully applied to enhance the biodegradation activity. The decomposition 
of H2O2 to water and oxygen can be toward enzymatic and non-enzymatic routes. 
Hydrogen peroxide also catalytically decomposes in the presence of numerous 
catalysts, e.g., most transition-metal ions such as Fe2+, Cu+, Cr2+, Co2+, or UV 
irradiation via different route to form a highly-oxidative OH•.

strongest oxidant, which is inferior only to fluorine. Hydroxyl radical can decompose 
the organic compounds relatively unselective with the rate constants ranging from 
109-1010 M-1s-1 (Buxton, et al., 1988). 
 Hydroxyl radical is generated among various AOPs in the reaction mixture 
and has been used for achieving the treatment of a myriad of contaminated waters and 
industrial wastewaters. Hydroxyl radical can react in aqueous solution by different 
types of reactions (Eqs. 2.1 to 2.4) depending on target compounds, wastewater 
composition, and environmental conditions (Hoigné, 1998): 
 
Electron transfer reaction:  OH• + Mn  Ö Mn+1 + (OH-)(aq) (2.1) 
Hydrogen abstraction: OH• + R-H Ö R• + H2O   (2.2) 
Electrophilic addition:  OH• + R2C=CR2 Ö •CR2-C(OH)R2           (2.3) 
Radical interaction: OH• + OH • Ö H2O2   (2.4) 
 
For complex or large aliphatic hydrocarbons, OH• will oxidize via electrophilic 
addition to form carbon-center radicals which immediately further react in a 
bimolecular reaction with dissolved oxygen to produce peroxyl radicals and 
sequentially stable oxidation products. On the other hand, OH• tends to react with 
small aliphatic compounds by the hydrogen abstraction mean in which carbon dioxide 
can be formed as the final product (complete mineralization). The oxidation of 
aromatic compounds by OH• is more complex than aliphatic hydrocarbons and could 
involve hydrogen abstraction, electrophilic addition, and radical interaction. Direct 
electron transfer normally occurs with inorganic pollutants. In addition, OH• itself can 
react with another OH• to combine or to disproportionate to form a stable product 
(Peres et al., 2003).

comply with the effluent standard and the ferric hydroxide will precipitate out as 
illustrated in Eq. (2.16). This ferric hydroxide sludge will cause a burden for further 
separation and disposal which is a major drawback for ordinary Fenton process. 
 
2.4 Fluidized-bed Fenton Process 
 
As mentioned previously, the major disadvantage of Fenton process is the 
production of a substantial amount of iron precipitation. To overcome and/or ease this 
problem, the fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) is one of the possible alternatives. The ferric 
ion generated from Eq. (2.5) can precipitate and crystallize onto the carriers’ surface 
in the form of iron oxide; hence, reducing the production of puffy ferric hydroxide 
sludge. In FBR, several important and complicated processes occur simultaneously 
including: 1) homogeneous chemical oxidation (H2O2/Fe2+); 2) heterogeneous 
chemical oxidation (H2O2/ iron oxide); 3) fluidized-bed crystallization; and 4) 
reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Factors influencing iron oxide crystallization on 
the surfaces of fluidized-bed carriers operated in FBR are pH, specific iron loading, 
H2O2/Fe2+, and superficial velocity (Chou, et al., 2004). Figure 2.2 illustrates the 
fluidized-bed Fenton mechanisms in details. The Fenton’s reagent can produce the 
non-selective oxidant OH• via homogeneous reaction (a). Then, this strong oxidant 
attacks the aromatic hydrocarbon to initiate ring opening as reaction (b). After that, 
the intermediate products from previous reaction appears, these lead into further 
oxidation (reaction (c)). From this Fenton’s reaction, Fe3+ is form (reaction (d)). The 
Fe3+ can be converted back to Fe2+ and initiate Fenton reaction further as in reaction 
(h). However, in the presence of solid carriers, the ferric hydrolysis product of 
Fenton’s reaction can also crystallize and grow on the surface of the carriers 
(reaction(e)); hence, decreasing the precipitation of puffy ferric hydroxide forms

where [2,6-DMA]0, [AN]0, and [2,6-DMA], [AN] are concentrations of 2,6-DMA, 
AN before and after the reaction, respectively; [OH•] is concentration of the hydroxyl 
radical; k2,6-DMA, kAN are the rate constants of OH• reacting with 2,6-DMA and AN, 
respectively. This final equation is similar to the one used by Shen et al. (2008) in the 
determination of the rate constant between p-chloronitrobenzene and OH•. According

physical and chemical processes. Reverse process of precipitation is called 
“dissolution.” Since these two processes are reversible but sometimes progress very 
slowly, both equilibrium and kinetics considerations are important. Knowledge of 
equilibrium relationships permits the calculation of equilibrium concentrations of 
cation(s) and anion(s) from the dissolution/precipitation of any salts. Nonetheless, in 
some heterogeneous systems, the equilibrium calculation may only provide the 
boundary conditions of the system rather than the situation that truly exists because 
the equilibrium is slowly established. In such cases, the kinetics consideration which 
is more complicated will play a major role in predicting the system behavior. 
 
2.6.2 Nucleation 
 
Once the product of cation(s) and anion(s) according to the solubility equation 
exceeds the dissociation constant, the solution will be oversaturated and a solid phase 
will be simultaneously formed. Various processes are involved in the solid formation; 
however, only three steps are believed to control the overall process. The first step is 
the interaction between ions or molecules leads to the formation of a critical cluster or 
nucleus or so called “nucleation” as shown in Eqs. (2.29) to (2.32). These nuclei can 
serve as the centers from which spontaneous growth of crystals can occur. The 
nucleation process determines the size and distribution of crystal produced. The 
second step is the formation of crystallites (crystal growth) as a result from sequential 
deposition of material on the nuclei formed from the first step as shown in Eq. (2.33). 
The last step is the formation of large crystals from the crystallites by a process called 
“ripening” as shown in Eq. (2.34) 
X + X     ↔ X2    (2.29) 
X2 + X    ↔ X3    (2.30) 
Xj-1 + X  ↔ Xj (critical cluster)  (2.31) 
Nucleation:   Xj + X    ↔ Xj+1    (2.32) 
Crystallite formation:   Xj + X    ↔ Xj+1  → crystal growth (2.33) 
Crystal formation:  Xj+1 + X  ↔ Xj+1  → crystal ripening (2.34) 
Nucleation can be divided into two types, i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous 
nucleation, depending on the number of phases during the initial step of solid 
 19
 
Figure 2.3 Schematic solubility isotherm of a solid electrolyte (Adapted from Stumm 
and Morgan, 1996).  
 
A nucleus will be formed if total Gibb’s free energy of the system decreases as 
a result from the formation of a new solid phase from an aqueous phase. In other word, 
the change in free energy of the formation of a nucleus (ΔGf) has to be negative. The 
“ΔGf” is the summation of free energy in the system which has two parts, i.e., free 
energy from bulk phase (ΔGbulk) and free energy from solid phase (ΔGsurface). The 
“ΔGbulk” is a function of supersaturation degree in the aqueous phase and is always 
negative for a supersaturation solution. On the other hand, the “ΔGsurface” is related to 
the interfacial energy between the surface of the solid being formed and the solvent; 
hence, is always positive. Then, the “ΔGf” will be negative if the negative quantity of 
“ΔGbulk” is greater than the positive quantity of “ΔGsurface” and; thus, the nucleus 
formation can be thermodynamically favorite. As a result, a large supersaturation 
must be exceeded before the pure solid nucleus can be formed from the homogeneous 
oversaturated solution by itself or so called “homogeneous nucleation”. 
 
 
2.6.2.2 Heterogeneous Nucleation 
 
 Heterogeneous nucleation is in many cases the predominant formation process 
for crystals in natural waters. In the presence of foreign solid particles, the “ΔGsurface” 
is reduced due to the interference of the interfacial energy of the external seeds 
(should match well with the crystal to be formed), thus reducing the formation free 
energy, and sequentially allow the nucleation to proceed more easily (Figure 2.4). In 
other words, these foreign solids are serving as the catalyst to reduce the energy 
barrier of the nucleation process similar to chemical catalysts which reduce the 
activation energy for chemical reaction. Theoretically, with proper matching between 
the foreign solid and the crystal to be precipitate, the nucleation may take place at a 
lower saturation ratio (in the metastable zone in Figure 2.3) on the solid surface than 
in solution (homogeneous nucleation).

from a step edge (surface diffusion); and 4) migration along a step edge to or from a 
kink (edge diffusion). Considering on the precipitation part, the ion or molecule will 
be more stable (lower free energy) as it embeds deeper into the solid matrix: a < b < c 
< d < e < f. If step 1 only is limiting, the kinetics are said to be diffusion or transport 
controlled. In this case, there is a concentration gradient in a liquid layer adjacent to 
the solid surface as shown in Figure 2.6. The liquid-film thickness depends on the 
mixing condition. On the other hand, if step 2, 3 and/or 4 only are limiting, the 
kinetics are said to be surface-interaction control and there will be no concentration 
gradient in the liquid adjacent to the solid surface. If the growth of crystal is 
controlled by the surface interaction; then, a zero-order rate law could be applied if 
the steady-state conditions at the surface prevail (Stumm and Morgan, 1996):

crystallites during the crystal growth stage as a result from colloidal transport and 
collision could be described by the second-order rate law as proposed by O’Melia and

where “N” is the number concentration of particles in suspension at time “t” and “ka” 
is a second-order rate constant which is a function of physical and chemical properties 
of the system including mass transport coefficient and collision efficiency factor. The 
second-order rate law of Eq. (2.38) is comparable to the very well-known rate of 
change in the concentration of colloidal particles during the flocculation process both 
in perikinetic (random diffusion control) and orthokinetic (movement of solvent or 
velocity gradient control) manners. 
 In this study, both transport equations (Eqs. (2.36) and (2.38)) were used to 
characterize the behavior of crystal formation in order to provide a better 
understanding on the crystallization process. 
 
2.7 Literature Reviews 
 
2.7.1 Competitive Kinetics Technique 
  
 Leitner and Roshani (2010) determined the rate constant of benzotriazole (BT) 
by the reaction of direct ozonation and OH• at different pH. They accessed the 
kinetics information by 2 approaches, i.e., the log-reduction of BT in the case which 
ozone was present in excess (1st-model) and the competition kinetic technique in the 
case which a reference compound was co-existed (2nd–model). The results showed 
that the 2nd order rate constant of BT with molecular ozone at pH 2 by the 1st-model 
was 36.4±3.8 M-1s-1 as compared to 18.4±0.8 M-1s-1 for the 2nd-model. With the 2nd-
model, the 2nd order rate constant at pH 5 was found to be 22.0±0.2 M-1s-1. In a 
second stage, the reaction of BT and OH• was carried out by using the 2nd–model 
 25
Photolysis of H2O2 at 254 nm was used to generate OH• and carbonate radicals were 
generated by the photolysis of Co(NH3)5CO3+ at 254 nm. Atrazine was used as the 
reference compound for both processes. The results found that the 2nd order rate 
constant of fenuron with OH• and carbonate radicals were found to be 7±1×109 M-1s-1 
and 7-12±3×106 M-1s-1, respectively. The intermediates of fenuron oxidized by 
hydroxyl and carbonate radicals were also identified by LC-MS.   
 
 Einschlag et al. (2003) determined the rate constant of a set of nitroaromatic 
compounds with OH• using competition experiment in the UV/H2O2 process. For a 
given pair of substrates S1 and S2, the relative reactivity β (defined as kS1/kS2) was 
calculated from the slope of the plot between ln[S1] VS ln[S2]. This method allows a 
better estimation of the relative reactivity than the plot of ln[S1] and ln[S2] against 
time. The rate constants of nitroaromatic substrates with OH• were found to be in 
between 0.33×109  and 8.6×109 M-1s-1.  
 
Spanggord et al. (2000) examined the kinetics of aminodinitrotoulenes (2-
amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT)) by 
using the competition kinetics in a peroxone (ozone and H2O2) oxidizing system 
where both OH• and ozone are important oxidants. The results found that the rate 
constant of 2- and 4-ADNT with ozone by using resorcinol as a reference compound 
were around 1.45×105 and 1.8×105 M-1s-1, respectively. For OH• oxidation, 
determined using p-nitoracetophenone (PNAP) as the reference compound, the rate 
constants were found to be 1.6×109 and 1.9×109 M-1s-1 for 2-, and 4-ADNT, 
respectively. Although rate constants for OH• oxidation were much higher than those 
for ozone, the kinetics modeling revealed that ozone was the dominant oxidant for 
ADNTs oxidation in the peroxone mixture, except when the ADNTs were below 1 
μM (200 ppb).

were effectively decolorized and 80% of the original COD was removed. 
 
Zelmanov and Semiat (2008) investigated the catalytic behavior of iron-based 
nano-catalysts on ethylene glycol and phenol treatment in the advanced oxidation 
processes. The results showed that the Fenton-like reaction using iron (III) oxide-
based nano-catalysts in the presence of H2O2 could degrade both substances 
efficiently. 
 
Dantas et al. (2006) evaluated the use of new composites as the adsorbents 
and/or heterogeneous catalysts for Fenton process to treat textile wastewater. The 
efficiency of the process was explored as a function of the experimental parameters: 
pH, H2O2 concentration and iron oxides content. The composites with high iron oxide 
content could effectively adsorb the contaminants in textile wastewater, and the 
adsorptive capacity increased with the iron content. These solids were also applied as 
the catalyst in the heterogeneous Fenton reaction and found to be very effective at pH 
3.0 with the consumption of H2O2 lower than those required by the homogeneous 
Fenton process. 
Baldrian et al. (2006) used the heterogeneous catalysts based on magnetic 
mixed iron oxides to decolorize several synthetic dyes. All the catalysts could 
catalyze H2O2 to produce highly reactive OH• which able to decolorize the synthetic 
dyes effectively. The most effective catalyst was FeO.Fe2O3 which provided more 
than 90% decolorization. The fastest decomposition proceeded during the first hour of 
the reaction. In addition to dye decolorization, all the catalysts also caused a 
significant decrease in COD. These catalysts were active in the pH range of 2–10 
depending on their structures and able to perform sequential catalytic cycles with low 
metal leaching. 
 
Christopher et al. (2005) studied Fenton-mediated oxidation in the presence 
and absence of oxygen. The experiment showed that the oxidation of formic acid 
could occur effectively under a variety of experiment conditions by Fenton process. 
The intermediates generated during formic acid oxidation were found to increase the

Chou and Huang (1998) studied on the oxidation of benzoic acid (BA) via 
Fenton-liked reaction using an innovative supported γ -FeOOH catalyst. Oxidation of 
BA by H2O2 was performed to understand the effects of initial pH and H2O2 dosage. 
The removal efficiency of BA at an initial pH of 3.2 was higher than at initial pH of 
6.0 and 10.0; this result can be partly explained by reductive dissolution of γ -
FeOOH. Therefore, the extent of heterogeneous catalysis was evaluated and found 
that the majority of mineralization of BA takes place on the catalyst surface while 
some occur in the aqueous phase due to iron dissolution of the catalyst. 
 
Lin and Gurol (1998) described the kinetics, mechanism, and implication on 
the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 with granular size goethite (∝-FeOOH) particles 
in aqueous solution. The results showed that the decomposition rate of H2O2 over 
goethite surface can be explained by the 2nd-order kinetic expression and the apparent 
reaction rate was dominated by the intrinsic reaction rates on the oxide surface rather 
than the mass transfer rate of H2O2 to the surface. The reaction mechanism for the 
decomposition of H2O2 on goethite surface was proposed on the basis of the 
fundamental reactions explaining the surface complexation chemistry for iron oxide 
and interaction of H2O2 with the surface sites as shown in Eqs. (2.43) to (2.47):

Lin et al. (1996) investigated on the possibility of using mixture of H2O2 and 
iron oxide (goethite, α-FeOOH) particles as a chemical oxidant for wastewater 
 31
Chou et al. (2001) applied a novel supported γ-FeOOH catalyst to oxidize 
benzoic acid (BA) in a circulating fluidized-bed reactor by H2O2 and to determine the 
effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They found that the degradation 
rate of H2O2 was proportional to its concentration and the BA decomposition 
depended on both BA and H2O2. Conclusively, although heterogeneous catalysis 
contributed primarily to the oxidation of BA at pH 4.4-7.0, the homogeneous catalysis 
was of increasing importance below pH 4.4. 
 
 Chou and Huang (1999) investigated on the effect of Fe2+ on the catalytic 
oxidation of benzoic acid (BA) in the FBR applying supported γ-FeOOH as the 
carrier. They found that both mineralization of organics and crystallization of Fe3+ 
were simultaneously well performed under proper condition. Moreover, the reductive 
and the crystallization of γ-FeOOH as well as the oxidation of BA was proposed 
based on the experiment results. The reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 2.7

  CHAPTER III 
METHODOLOGY 
 
 
3.1 Materials and Chemicals 
 
3.1.1 Chemicals 
 
2,6-DMA, n,n-dimethyl-aniline (n,n-DMA), aniline (AN), 2,6-dimethyl-
phenol (2,6-DMP), 2,6-dimethyl-nitrobenzene (2,6-DMN), 2,6-dimethyl-
benzoquinone (2,6-DMB), FeSO4•7H2O, H2O2, and all chemical substances used in 
this work were analytical reagent grade. Fluidized media were quartz sand (SiO2), 
construction sand (CS), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Except stated otherwise, the 
diameter sizes of SiO2 and CS were 0.42 to 0.59 mm by using the sieves #30 & #40 
(passing #30 but retained on #40) whereas the size of Al2O3 was 2.5 mm which was 
the smallest size commercially available. All media were soaked in HCl solution at 
pH 1 for 24 hours, washed with de-ionized water until the solution pH was 7, and then 
oven dried at 103°C (Lo and Chen, 1997). De-ionized water from a Millipore system 
with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ /cm was used for preparing all solutions. 
 
3.1.2 Batch Reactor 
 
 For the batch experiments both for 2,6-DMA degradation kinetics study and 
iron precipitation/crystallization study, a 0.5-liter Pyrex beaker in a water bath for 
temperature control at 25±0.2°C was used as the reactor (as shown in Appendix A). 
 
3.1.3 Fluidized-bed Reactor 
 
A 1.35-liter glass-cylinder reactor with an inlet, outlet, and a recirculation 
pump as shown in Figure 3.1 was used as the fluidized-bed reactor (FBR). The carrier 
used in this study was either quartz sand, construction sand, or aluminum oxide. The  
 
 35
reaction was simultaneously started. At selected time interval, an appropriate amount 
of aliquot was taken from the reactor for analysis. To stop further Fenton reaction, an 
appropriate amount of 0.1 N NaOH was added to the sample to raise the pH to 
alkaline range. After that, the solution was filtered by a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate 
membrane filter to separate precipitated iron before analysis. Solution pH was 
controlled constantly by the addition of 1+3 H2SO4 or 1 or 6 N NaOH whenever 
necessary. All experimental activities are described in Figure 3.2. 
For the continuous study, the synthetic wastewater with Fe2+ dissolution and 
H2O2 solution were separately, but continuously and equally (18 ml/min), fed into the 
0.5-liter beaker by a peristaltic pump. The effluent characteristics were monitored 
until the steady state has been reached. All other procedures were similar to the batch 
study. 
 
3.2.1.2 Fluidized-bed Reactor 
 
For fluidized-bed Fenton experiment, the synthetic wastewater with desired 
Fe2+ concentration was prepared in a beaker before pouring into the FBR. After that, 
300 gm (300 g per 1.3 L) of carriers was filled into the reactor. The internal 
recirculation pump was switched on to mix the solution and suspend the carrier at 
50% bed expansion. The pH was adjusted to 3.0±0.1 by 1+3 H2SO4. Next, H2O2 
solution was added and the reaction was simultaneously started. Solution pH was 
controlled constantly by the addition of 1+3 H2SO4 or 1 or 6 N NaOH whenever 
necessary. At selected time interval, an appropriate amount of aliquot was taken from 
the FBR for analysis. Pretreatment step was similar to the case of Fenton experiment. 
Experimental steps are summarized in Figure 3.2. 
 
 
 
3.2.2 Iron Crystallization 
 
All experimental procedures and setup for completely mixed reactor and 
fluidized-bed reactor in this part were similar to those in the kinetics study. 
 37
3.3 Experimental Scenarios 
 
 This research study was divided mainly into two parts. The first part aimed to 
determine the kinetics and mechanism of 2,6-DMA degradation by OH•. Various 
experimental scenarios, including batch and continuous modes, with and without solid 
media, were performed to determine the intrinsic 2nd-order rate constant between 2,6-
DMA and OH• to ensure the accuracy of the obtained values. For mechanism 
determination, several extra experiments were performed using the initially identified 
aromatic intermediates, i.e., 2,6-DMP, 2,6-DMN and 2,6-DMB, as the target 
compounds for cross-checking purpose. In the second part, the behavior of the iron 
precipitation and crystallization onto the media in the FBR was investigated. 
 
3.3.1 Kinetics of 2,6-Dimethyl-aniline Degradation  
 
 To determine the intrinsic 2nd-order rate constant between 2,6-DMA and OH•, 
6 experimental scenarios (Scenarios B to G) were set up and carried out. In addition, 
one control experiment was also performed for system control (Scenario A). 
 
Scenario A 
Determination of the effect of volatilization and H2O2 on the disappearance of 
2,6-DMA, n,n-dimethylaniline, and aniline in a batch reactor under the conditions as 
shown in Table 3.1. This experiment was conducted to observe the reactivity of all 
target compounds with H2O2 as well as their ability to volatile to the atmosphere 
under the studied conditions.

part aimed to investigate the effect of solid media on the disappearance rate and rate

 3.3.3 Iron Precipitation and Crystallization 
 
 Since the precipitation and crystallization of solid particles occur 
simultaneously and simultaneously, this research decided to investigate all the 
conditions involving in these two processes. 
 
Scenario I 
Preliminary study on the effect of pH on iron solubility with the conditions as 
shown in Table 3.9. Since Fe2+ is one of the Fenton’s reagent and Fe3+ is the oxidize 
product from Fenton reaction, it is important to determine the aqueous solubility of 
both iron species. This can ensure that all FeSO4•7H2O being added could completely 
dissolve in the water and the precipitation of Fe3+ can be understood.

Scenario M  
 Determination of effect of Fe(OH)3 crystallites on crystallization process with 
the conditions as shown in Table 3.13. In this part, the Fenton reaction was allowed to 
proceed in a completely mixed reactor (CMR) for 1 hour without any medium before 
transferring into the FBR for crystallization for 3 hours (1-hr pre-CMR+FBR). This 
scenario was different from previous in term of the crystallite formation. In previous 
scenario, the iron crystallites were formed and the crystallization onto the sand 
surface occurred simultaneously. On the other hand, the crystallites were allowed to 
ripen for 1 hour (the crystals became larger) before the crystallization in the FBR 
could happen.

3.4 Analytical Methods 
 
3.4.1 Measurement of Aromatic Compounds 
 
After raising the pH by 0.1 N NaOH addition and filtered by cellulose acetate 
membranes with 0.22 μm pore size to separate precipitated iron, the sample was 
analyzed for residual organic compounds and its intermediates by using a GC-17A 
gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and HP-5 capillary 
column (Hewlett-Packard) with 0.53-mm in inside diameter and 15-m length. Exactly 
1.0 μl of sample was injected into the injection port. The column temperature was 
initially set at 85°C for 3 minutes, then increased by 65°C per minute to 200°C and 
maintained at this temperature for the final 5 minutes. Injector and detector 
temperatures were set at 250 and 280°C, respectively. o-toluidine was used as the 
internal standard. Chromatogram of all aromatic compounds used in this study is 
shown in Figure 3.3 and the standard curves are shown in Appendix B.

hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane. The flow rate and temperature were 
set at 1.2 ml min-1 and 40 °C, respectively. Exactly 10 μl of the alkaline sample after 
NaOH addition was injected into the injecting port. 
 
3.4.6 Identification of Aromatic Intermediates 
 
 To identify the aromatic intermediates from 2,6-DMA oxidation by OH•, 4 ml 
of the sample after stopping Fenton reaction was injected into an extraction tube 
containing 2 ml of n-hexane. The tube was then shaken by hand 100 times, followed 
by 15 minutes of sonication, and then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The 
upper-layer of n-hexane was withdrawn as much as possible into a 5-ml analyzing 
tube. The remaining mixture in the extraction tube was then re-extracted twice more 
following the same procedure. At the third extraction, the upper-layer of n-hexane 
was pulled out and filled the analyzing tube up to the 5-ml mark. A small amount of 
anhydrous Na2SO4 was added to remove moisture before GC analysis. One μl of the 
extraction solvent into the Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC System 
equipped with a J&W DB-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m) and connected 
with the 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector. The GC temperature program was as 
follows: 40°C for 2 min, followed by a 15 °C min-1 ramp to 280 °C, then hold for 5 
min. 
 
3.4.7 Solid Characterization 
  
 Iron oxide coated media were characterized for their surface properties, 
including specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size, and iron oxide species by 
BET surface analyzer (Autosorb-1 from Quantachrome) and XRD analyzer (D8 
Discover from Bruker AXS.), respectively.

be greater than aniline. Following the experimental triplications from Figure 4.4(b), 
the results showed that the ratios of the rate constant between 2,6-DMA and aniline 
by the Fenton process under the condition of 1 mM of 2,6-DMA, 1 mM of aniline, 1 
mM of Fe2+, 20 mM of H2O2, pH 3, and 25°C were quite steady with an average of 
3.61. The rate constants were estimated to be in the range of 1.65×1010 to 1.80×1010 
M-1sec-1 as shown in Table 4.1. Furthermore, under other conditions as described in 
Scenario D, the rate constants between 2,6-DMA and OH• in the Fenton reaction were 
found to be quite steady between 1.59×1010 and 1.80×1010 M-1 sec-1 as summarized in 
Table 4.1 (graphical determinations are shown in Appendix E). By averaging the 
values in Table 4.1, the second-order intrinsic rate constant between 2,6-DMA and 
OH• obtained from the batch study without media was 1.71×1010 M-1sec-1.  
 
4.1.3.2 Batch Study in the Presence of Media 
  
In this section, the intrinsic rate constant of 2,6-DMA with OH• was 
determined in a silica-suspension batch reactor to simulate a fluidized-bed reactor 
(Scenario E). Figure 4.5(a) shows the time profiles of aniline and 2,6-DMA in the 
presence of SiO2. As compared to ordinary Fenton process without SiO2 (Figure 4.4a), 
it can be seen that both removal rate and efficiency in the presence of SiO2 were 
significantly lower. This is possibly due to the limitation of Fe2+ in the presence of 
SiO2 suspension as a result from surface complexation which should be similar to the 
condition which occurs in the fluidized-bed Fenton reactor. Certain portion of added 
Fe2+ was adsorbed onto the surface of SiO2; hence, reduced the amount of free Fe2+ to 
catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to generate the powerful OH•. As a result, the 
disappearance rates of aniline and 2,6-DMA were decelerated as compared to in the 
absence of SiO2. Nonetheless, the results showed that the ratio of the rate constants 
between 2,6-DMA and aniline obtained from the SiO2-suspension reactor which 
simulating the fluidized-bed Fenton reactor of 3.34 (Figure 4.5(b)) which is 
corresponding to the value of the rate constant of 1.6×1010 M-1 sec-1 (Table 4.1) was 
comparable to the results from previous part.

the degradation of 2,6-DMA and AN (using the data obtained from Scenario D). 
Figure 4.8 shows the degradation profiles of 2,6-DMA and AN concurrently present 
in the Fenton process. It can be seen that when the Fe2+:H2O2 ratio was kept constant 
at 1:20, the disappearance rate of both target compounds increased as the 
concentration of Fenton’s reagent increased. This implies that, for the 2,6-DMA and 
AN solution at 1 mM each, the amounts of Fe2+ and H2O2 being added in this study

OH• attack than amine- and nitro-functional groups. In addition to the aromatic 
intermediates, several carboxylic acids were also detected; including maleic, lactic, 
oxalic, acetic, and formic acids. The pathway of 2,6-DMA oxidation by OH• is 
proposed as shown in Figure 4.9. The proposed mechanism is quite similar to those of 
aniline oxidation by OH• either in the Fenton processes (Brillas et al., 1998) or in the 
catalytic ozonation (Sauleda and Brillas, 2001) or by oxygen in the wet air oxidation 
(Oliviero et al., 2003). This is understandable since the methyl group on the aromatic 
ring of 2,6-DMA was not susceptible to OH• attack as mentioned previously; 
therefore, OH• would attack other sites around the benzene ring of 2,6-DMA (either at 
the amine or hydrogen positions) as if it was AN. In addition, several identified 
species obtained from this study were also in agreement with Skoumal et al. (2008) 
who studied the oxidation of chloroxylenol by electrochemical advanced oxidation 
processes. They found OH• attacked at the chlorine position to form 2,6-DMH, which 
was further oxidized to 2,6-DMB and several carboxylic acids similar to the 
observation in this study. Moreover, the ring-cleavage C-3 or lower compounds 
identified in this work were corresponding very well with the reaction network for the 
catalytic wet air oxidation of maleic acid proposed by Oliviero et al. (2001). 
The time profiles of the major products are illustrated in Figure 4.10(a), which 
reveals that the concentrations of the aromatic intermediates were very low (i.e., less 
than 0.015 mM) even though 80% of 10 mM 2,6-DMA have been already 
transformed. This indicates that the aromatic ring was rapidly ruptured to form open-
chain products. Hence, the toxicity impact of these aromatic intermediates could be 
neglected since 2,6-DMP which is more toxic than 2,6-DMA was accumulated at the 
very low concentrations of around 0.014 mM or less and disappeared rapidly when 
the oxidation process proceeded. Acetic and formic acids, which are the most 
successive organic products prior to conversion to CO2, were accumulated in the 
solution. This implies that under the studied conditions within 60 minutes of reaction 
time, 2,6-DMA could not be completely mineralized to CO2. This is in agreement 
with the total organic carbon profile as shown in Figure 4.10(b) in which only 35% of 
initial organic carbon was converted to CO2. Considering the carbon balance at the 
end of the reaction period, it can be seen that approximately 70% of the organic 
carbon could be quantified from the identified intermediates.

On the other hand, Fe3+ which was the product from Fe2+ oxidation by H2O2 in Fenton 
reaction was much less soluble than Fe2+, i.e., only 10 mg/l dissolved at pH 3 and 
became lessen as the pH increased as shown in Figure 4.11(b). These results suggest 
the Fe3+ should continuously precipitate out in the form of Fe(OH)3 during the Fenton 
reaction at pH greater than 3 since the concentration of Fe2+ being used was typically 
higher than 10 mg/l. These results are in agreement with the theoretical principle as 
shown in Figure 4.12. The lines which representing the concentrations of various 
ferric-hydroxo complexes as a function of pH are calculated based on theoretical 
principle of ferric-hydroxo complexes and ferric hydroxide precipitation at 25°C in 
ideal solution (neglecting the ionic strength). Details for the calculation are shown in 
Appendix F. The points were the solubility data observed from the experiments. The 
difference might be due to the effect of ionic strength in the real solution. The data at 
pH greater than 3 could not be detected accurately because they were lower than the 
detection limit of the Phenanthroline method. 
In order to ensure that the solid ferric phase precipitated out was Fe(OH)3 
rather than other ferric oxide species, a test was performed in the absence of oxygen 
gas by purging with nitrogen gas during the dissolution and placing into the BOD 
bottle (Scenario O). The results in Figure 4.13 show that the solubility of Fe3+ 
gradually decreased with time and the soluble Fe3+ was approaching the value

solution. The crystallization can occur without the concomitant nucleation stage if the 
solution is seeded with crystallites or foreign particles which could provide their 
surfaces for nucleation or so called “heterogeneous nucleation”. These differences in 
solid properties also impacted the crystallization onto fluidized-bed media as will be 
discussed later. 
It is important to note that the iron solutions prepared at pH 2 to 12 would 
significantly have different ionic strength due to acid/alkaline addition for pH 
adjustment. The difference in ionic strength might affect the solubility of iron due to 
activity dissimilarity. As a result, another test (Scenario I) was conducted by buffering 
the ionic strength of the solutions at different pH with 0.1 M of NaClO4.  Figure 4.11(a) 
shows that the effect of ionic strength on ferrous solubility. Between pH 5.4 and 5.8, 
the ionic strengths of Fe2+ solution with and without NaClO4 were approximately 
2.0×10-6 (mainly from SO42-) and 1.0×10-1 M (mainly from Na+ and ClO4-), 
respectively. It can be seen that the effect was diminutive and could be neglected even 
though the ionic strengths of these solutions were almost 50 times different. This was 
possible due to the accuracy of the phenanthroline method at very low Fe2+ 
concentration; i.e., the remaining Fe2+ concentration might be lower than the 
detectable limit for 1 cm light path. Nonetheless, the ionic strength of the solution was 
buffered by 0.1 M NaClO4 in the case of Fe3+ solubility test. 
 
4.2.2 Fe(OH)3 Crystallization in Fluidized-bed Reactor 
 
In this part (from Scenario K), Fe3+ was precipitated out in the form of 
Fe(OH)3 at pH 7 in the absence of H2O2 to simulate the neutralization condition after 
Fenton treatment. Under this condition, the concentration product of Fe3+ and OH- 
was much higher than the solubility product of Fe(OH)3 implying a supersaturated 
solution. It was very interesting to found that Fe(OH)3 very poorly crystallized onto 
the fluidized media including SiO2, Al2O3, and CS as shown in Figure 4.14. It is 
believed that the formation of Fe(OH)3 at pH 7 is very rapid; hence, the mechanism 
mainly followed the homogeneous crystallization rather than the heterogeneous 
crystallization. Fe(OH)3 cluster or nucleus was rapidly formed from the 
supersaturated solution and serving as nuclei for further material deposition to  
 71
simultaneously into the FBR with either CS or SiO2 serving as the fluidized materials 
at pH 3. In this scenario, the experiment with CS was duplicated to determine the 
reliability and repeatability of the experimental setup and procedure. It can be seen 
from Figure 4.15 that these two duplicated runs provided very close results which 
implied that the experimental setup and procedure were reliable and accurate. 
Regarding on the type of fluidized material, it was found that the iron crystallization 
onto the CS was faster than onto the SiO2 even though the iron removal efficiencies at 
180 minutes were comparable. This may be due to the impurity on the CS surface 
and/or surface property of the CS. To verify this hypothesis, CS with different size 
distribution, i.e., passing sieve #30 but retained on sieve #40 (0.42 mm < φ < 059 mm) 
versus passing sieve #30 (φ < 059 mm), were tested and the results were shown in 
Figure 4.15. It can be seen that the iron crystallization rate and efficiency of both sets 
were comparable indicating that the size of CS did not have any significant impact on 
iron crystallization under the studied conditions. It is well documented that most of 
Fe2+ is simultaneously transformed to Fe3+ after the initiation of the Fenton reaction. 
Data from this study confirmed with this statement as shown in the Table D.30, i.e., 
Fe2+ disappeared instantly within the first 5 minutes to form Fe3+. Most of

also increased with iron concentration. 
 
4.2.6 Effect of Turbulence 
 
 After the nucleation process (i.e., the initial formation of solid nuclei), 
spontaneous growth of crystal will occur. The attachment of a molecule/nucleus to 
another nucleus to form a solid lattice which includes the transportation of materials 
to the surface of these nuclei and surface deposition will become very important and 
should follow the mechanism of solid-solution interface at the molecular level. To 
understand the mechanism of iron crystallization, a set of experiment was performed. 
Ferric solution at 1 mM was prepared at pH 3 and vigorously purging with either air 
or O2 (Scenario O). The results show that soluble iron decreased at the same pace for 
both conditions as shown in Figure 4.19. In addition, the reduction of soluble iron in

Figure 4.25 Reusability of iron-coated CS for iron crystallization with the initial 
conditions as follows: 230.77 g/l of CS, pH 3 at 25°C and 1 mM of Fe2+ and 20 mM 
of H2O2 for cycle 1 to 5 and 2 mM of Fe2+ and 40 mM of H2O2 for cycle 6 to 101.  
 
It can be seen that the iron crystallization efficiency in 1 hour decreased gradually 
from 80% in the first cycle to 65% in the 101st cycle. This is believed to be due to the 
decreasing in the crystallization rate of iron crystallites onto the interaction sites on 
the iron-coated CS as the Fe(OH)3 accumulating on the surface. Exhaustion of 
effective sites for crystallization was not believed to be the main cause because the 
reduction in iron still proceeded after 3 hours as shown in the profile plot of the 101st 
cycle as compared to the first cycle (Figure 4.26). It is very interesting to observe that 
the reduction of soluble iron in the 101st cycle was more rapid than those in the first 
cycle whereas the reduction of total iron turned to the opposite direction. This implies 
that the Fe(OH)3 coated on the CS could somehow accelerate the formation of iron 
nuclei and crystallites; however, retard the crystallization rate of those crystallites 
onto the sand surface. The results from this part reveal that the iron crystallization 
performance in the real fluidized-bed Fenton reactor will be gradually deteriorated or 
decelerated with time. Hence, to maintain the high iron removal performance, it is 
wisely to continuously and constantly replace a portion of iron-coated CS in the FBR 
with the similar amount of fresh CS. To characterize the iron oxide coated on the CS 
surface, the 101st-cycle CS sample was analyzed by the XRD analyzer to determine

Figure 4.27 XRD analysis of the 101st-cycle iron-coated CS. 
 
determine the catalytic activity of iron-coated CS and compare with those of 
commercial goethite (Scenario R). The results show that the 75 g of the 101st-cycle 
iron-coated CS had the catalytic activity approximately equivalent to 3 g of goethite 
in terms of AN and 2,6-DMA oxidations as shown in Figure 4.28. It is important to 
note that goethite had higher BET surface than iron-coated CS (8.63 versus 13.51 
m2/gm) which might affect the catalytic activity of these two iron oxides since the 
reactions involved surface interaction. In spite of surface difference, other factors 
such as iron oxide species should have more impact on the catalytic activity since the 
difference in surface area between these two iron oxides was only 1.6 time but the 
difference in reactivity was enormous, i.e., 75 g/l of iron-coated CS could remove 
only 30 and 40% of 1 mM of AN and 2,6-DMA, respectively, at 180 minutes whereas 
the same amount of goethite could completely remove both compounds in just 15 
minutes. It was well documented that Fe(OH)3 has much lower catalytic activity than 
goethite and this should be the main contribution to poorer performance of the 101st-
cycle iron-coated CS as compared to goethite (α-FeOOH).

Certain amounts of iron in the forms of Fe2+ and Fe3+ were leaching out into 
the mixture as shown in Figure 4.29 indicating that the reductive dissolution of iron 
oxide also happened in the mixture as suggested by Lu (2000). Nonetheless, further 
analysis for the determination of the rate constant between 2,6-DMA and OH• by 
using competitive rate kinetics with AN as a reference compound as shown in Figure 
4.30 (as an example plot) provided the slope, which is the ratio of k2,6-DMA to kAN, of 
1.2725. This value was significantly different from the average of 3.5462 obtained 
from previous part where Fe2+ was added as illustrated in Section 4.1. This indicates 
that the degradation mechanism of 2,6-DMA and AN in the heterogeneous Fenton 
reaction was different from those in homogeneous Fenton reaction. As proposed by 
Lin and Gurol (1998), the decomposition of H2O2 occurred at the iron oxide surface. 
Hence, the oxidation of 2,6-DMA and AN in the heterogeneous Fenton reaction might 
involve the surface reaction resulting in different apparent rate constant from those of 
homogeneous reaction.

fluidized-bed Fenton process. The outcomes of this part could be concluded as 
follows: 
• Solubility of ferric is much less than those of ferrous; hence, after the initiation 
of Fenton reaction, ferric from ferrous oxidation should precipitate out in the 
form of ferric hydroxide even in the acidic solution. 
• Saturation degree is the major factor controlling the precipitation process. 
Solid phase will be formed via the homogeneous nucleation if the precipitation 
occurs in the labile zone; iron removal in the fluidized-bed Fenton reactor will 
be sequentially unimpressive because the crystallization rate of iron onto 
fluidized media is very slow. On the other hand, if the precipitation happens 
within the metastable zone, heterogeneous nucleation will become 
predominate and the removal of iron in the fluidized-bed Fenton reactor will 
be rapid and exceptional.  
• Newly formed crystallite has higher affinity with the foreign solid surface than 
aging or ripening crystallites; hence, the crystallization should occur 
simultaneously with the Fenton reaction in the fluidized-bed reactor in order to 
obtain the highest iron removal rate. 
• Under the studied conditions, the crystallization process was controlled by the 
transport step rather than the surface-interaction step. Rate of crystal growth 
under turbulent condition followed the 2nd-order rate with respect to iron 
concentration (orthokinetic flocculation). In contrast, the growth rate under 
stagnant condition could be sufficiently explained by the transport mechanism 
both at the molecular and crystallite (perikinetic flocculation) levels. 
• Presence of organic compounds/intermediates which can form complex with 
ferric such as oxalic acid will increase the solubility of ferric; hence, 
deteriorate the crystallization process. As a result, to obtain the significant iron 
removal in a full-scale fluidized-bed Fenton reactor, the oxidation reaction 
should proceed intensively toward complete mineralization. 
• The rate of iron crystallization in the fluidized-bed Fenton reactor will 
gradually decrease with time; hence, to maintain the crystallization rate, a 
portion of coated-media has to be continuously replaced with fresh media.

2006), no intrinsic kinetic rate constant of the reaction between aniline and OH• has been reported.  
This constant is very important and useful scientific and engineering information and is deserved to 
be investigated.  As a result, this research project will focus on the determination of the 
second-order rate constant between aniline and OH•.  In addition, this research will also 
characterize the iron crystallization onto the carriers in a fluidized-bed reactor in order to provide a 
better understanding on iron removal from Fenton process which is valuable to field practice. 
 
2) Objectives  
1. To determine the intrinsic rate constant between aniline and hydroxyl radicals in 
ordinary and fluidized-bed Fenton processes. 
2. To characterize iron precipitation and crystallization onto the carriers in fluidized-bed 
Fenton process. 
 
3) Hypotheses 
1. Oxidation of aniline by hydroxyl radicals is a second-order reaction. 
2. Aniline decomposition by ordinary and fluidized-bed Fenton processes depends on 
system pH and chemical dosages. 
3. Metal oxide can effectively serve as a medium for iron crystallization in fluidized-bed 
Fenton process. 
4. Aniline and its intermediates have an effect on iron crystallization in fluidized-bed 
Fenton process. 
 
4) Theoretical Background 
 
Properties of aniline (USEPA, 1985; ASTDR, 2002) 
  
Aniline (C6H5NH2) is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring and an amino 
group. The chemical structure of aniline is shown in Figure 1. Aniline is a clear to slightly yellow 
liquid and is moderately soluble in water but mixes readily with most organic solvents.  Aniline 
ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame.  It possesses a somewhat pleasant vinous odour 
and a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison.  It is used to manufacture many products 
including polyurethane foam, agricultural chemicals, synthetic dyes, antioxidants, stabilizers for 
rubber industry, herbicides, varnishes, and explosives.  Aniline can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or 
by skin contact. Aniline damages hemoglobin, a protein that normally transports oxygen in the 
blood, so that oxygen cannot be transported to cells and tissues causing them to lack oxygen for 
their metabolisms. This condition is known as “methemoglobinemia”.  Dizziness, headaches, 
irregular heart beat, convulsions, coma, and death may also occur resulting from an acute exposure 
to high aniline dosage.  Direct contact with aniline can also produce skin and eye irritation. 
Long-term exposure to lower levels of aniline may cause symptoms similar to those experienced in 
acute high-level exposure.  Aniline is released into the environmental primarily from industrial 
uses.  Aniline has been found in industrial wastewater and leachates from disposal sites.

  As mentioned previously, the major disadvantage of Fenton process is the production of a 
substantial amount of iron precipitation. To overcome and/or ease this problem, the fluidized-bed 
reactor (FBR) is one of the possible alternatives. In FBR, several important processes occur 
simultaneously including: a) Homogeneous chemical oxidation (H2O2/Fe2+); b) Heterogeneous 
chemical oxidation (H2O2/ iron oxide); c) Fluidized-bed crystallization; d) Reductive dissolution of 
iron oxides.  The ferric hydrolysis product of Fenton’s reaction can crystallize and grow on the 
surface of the carriers; hence, decreasing the precipitation in puffy ferric hydroxide form (Chou et 
al., 1999). At the same time, the synthesized ferric oxide can also serve as a catalyst for hydrogen 
peroxide decomposition in a heterogeneous oxidation (Chou et al., 2001) 
 
Rate constant determination 
 
 In this research, the intrinsic second-order rate constant of the reaction between aniline and 
OH• will be determined by using a technique of competitive kinetics between aniline and an organic 
probe in the presence of OH•.  This organic probe has to have the intrinsic rate constant with OH• 
reported (Buxton et al., 1988).  Nonetheless, the competitive kinetics as will be described later is a 
very useful and simple tool to estimate the unknown rate constant of a compound without any 
complexity in experimental setup and equipments.  It is well established that OH• will react with 
any compound in a second-order manner; hence, the rate laws can be written as follows: [ ] [ ][ ]

At the initial stage where the competition reactions from the intermediates from the oxidation of 
aniline and organic probe are minimal, Eq (15) can be neglected; hence: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, this organic probe should have a comparable rate with OH• to aniline in order to be able 
to obtain accurate initial rates for both compounds at the same time.  In this study, several 
aromatic compounds with known rate constants such as benzene and benzoic acid will be tested for 
their potential to serve as an organic probe.

of H2O2 was necessary along the reaction. 
 
Removal of organic compound in heterogeneous catalysis by hydrogen peroxide  
 
Zelmanov and Semiat (2008) investigated the catalytic behavior of iron-based 
nano-catalysts for ethylene glycol and phenol treatment in the advanced oxidation processes. The 
results showed that the Fenton-like reaction using iron (III) oxide-based nano-catalysts in the 
presence of H2O2 could degrade both substances efficiently. 
Flores et al. (2008) demonstrated that H2O2 could be activated in the presence of a 
heterogeneous catalyst (Fe3+-containing ashes) to become a powerful oxidant. Fe3+ was 
immobilized by leaching test which indicated that more of the 99 wt.% of the iron ion still stayed in 
the solid catalysts and the presence of H2O2 did not alter this relation. It is concluded that radical 
species (HO2•) are formed when H2O2 was activated by the immobilized Fe3+. The results show that 
it was possible to oxidize reactive black 5 dye using a stoichiometric amount of H2O2. After 2 hours 
of treatment, reactive solutions were effectively decolorized and 80% of the original COD was 
removed. 
Dantas et al. (2006) evaluated the use of new composites as the adsorbents and/or 
heterogeneous catalysts for Fenton process to treat textile wastewater. The efficiency of the process 
was explored as a function of the experimental parameters: pH, H2O2 concentration and iron oxides 
content. The composites with high iron oxides content could effectively adsorb the contaminants in 
textile wastewater, and the adsorptive capacity increased with the iron concentration. These solids 
were also used as the heterogeneous Fenton catalysts and were effective at pH 3.0 with a 
consumption of H2O2 lower than those required by the homogeneous Fenton process. 
Baldrian et al. (2006) used the heterogeneous catalysts based on magnetic mixed iron oxides 
to decolorized several synthetic dyes. All the catalysts could catalyze H2O2 to yield highly reactive 
hydroxyl radicals which able to decolorize the synthetic dyes effectively. The most effective 
catalyst was FeO.Fe2O3 which provided more than 90% decolorization. The fastest decomposition 
proceeded during the first hour of the reaction. In addition to dye decolorization, all the catalysts 
also caused a significant decrease of COD. These catalysts were active in the pH range of 2–10 
depending on their structures and able to perform sequential catalytic cycles with low metal 
leaching. 
Christopher et al. (2005) studied Fenton-mediated oxidation in the presence and absence of 
oxygen. The experiment showed that the oxidation of formic acid occurred under a variety of 
experiment conditions by Fenton’s process. The intermediate generated during formic acid 
oxidation was observed to increase oxidation efficiency, especially at high initial organic 
concentrations, by contributing in the redox cycling of iron. In the presence of oxygen, however, 
such improvement was attenuated through competition for the organic intermediates. 
Lu et al. (2002) investigated how surface dissolution of goethite affected 2-chlorophenol 
oxidation in the goethite/H2O2 process. The results show that ligand and reductant could enhance 
the dissolution rate of goethite which was a surface-controlled mechanism. Furthermore, the result

Photocatalytic process  
Photocatalytic process is one process of advance oxidation processes (AOPs).  These 
AOPs are very useful for the degradation of nonbiodegradable organic or toxic pollutants.  
Moreover, they are much more efficient than the conventional techniques such as coagulation, 
precipitation, adsorption on activated carbon in that the AOPs can lead to

the complete mineralization and can also dechlorinate the halogenous compounds.  
 
Photocatalysis of TiO2 
Photocatalysis over a semiconductor oxide such as TiO2 is initiated when TiO2 absorbs 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or illuminated light source (fluorescent lamps), it will 
produce pairs of electrons and holes. The electron of the valence band of TiO2 becomes excited 
when illuminated by light.  The excess energy of this excited electron promoted the electron to 
transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 creating the negative-electron (e-) and positive-hole (h+) 
pair. This stage is referred as the semiconductor’s “photo-excitation” state.  The energy difference 
between the valence band and the conduction band is known as the “Band Gap”.  Wavelength (λ) 
of the light necessary for photo-excitation of TiO2 is 380 nm which is equivalent to 3.2 eV.  The 
positive-hole of TiO2 breaks apart the water molecule to form hydrogen gas and hydroxyl radical 
(●OH).  The negative-electron reacts with oxygen molecule to form super oxide anion (O2-).  
These 2 powerful oxidizing agents will then disintegrate and rearrange the structure of the organic 
pollutants and convert them into CO2 and H2O.  The overall process is illustrated in the Figure 2. 
 
Photocatalysis of doping TiO2 
Recently, TiO2 has been utilized as a photocatalyst for environmental remediation such as 
air-purification, deodorizing, sterilization, self-cleaning and water treatment.  However, it is facing 
with two major limits in real practice.  Firstly, TiO2 requires UV of the wavelength shorter than 
380 nm, whose energy exceeds the band gap of 3.2 eV of the anatase crystalline phase; hence, 
utilizing only a very small fraction of sunlight.  Secondly, TiO2 has a high recombination rate of

Sol-gel process 
The sol-gel process is a flexible solution process for making ceramic and glass materials.  
In general, the sol-gel process involves the transition of a system from a liquid “sol” (mostly 
colloidal) into a solid “gel” phase.  Applying the sol-gel process, it is possible to fabricate ceramic 
or glass materials in a wide variety of forms: ultrafine or spherical shaped powders, thin film 
coatings, ceramic fibers, microporous inorganic membranes, monolithic ceramics and glasses, or 
extremely porous aerogel materials. 
 The sol-gel process begins with the starting materials used in the preparation of the “sol” 
which are usually inorganic metal salts or metal organic compounds such as metal

phenoxy herbicides.  Indirect sources include discharges from pulp and paper mills as by-products 
of chlorine-based bleaching, the release from manufacturing industries are significant with 
accidental spillage being negligible, as a result of disinfection of sewage and industrial wastewater 
with chlorine and from slow microbial breakdown of herbicides during post-application period.  
The compound is also used as a solvent for extracting sulfur and nitrogen compounds from coal.   
2-Chlorophenol is very toxic and poorly biodegradable.  A wastewater stream containing 
2-chlorophenol over 200 mg/l may not be treated effectively by direct biological methods [8]. There 
are many researches studied on the oxidation of 2-chlorophenol under photocatalytic, 
electrocatalytic, and Fenton oxidation. It has been observed that the types and distribution of 
intermediates depended on the experimental conditions.  Thus, catechol and cyclopentadienic 
acids were reported as major intermediates in photolysis, whereas phenol, hydroquinone,
 benzoquinone, chlorohydroquinone, and hydroxyhydroquinone were formed under 
photocatalytic conditions. 
  It is reported that higher pH discouraged the formation of aromatic intermediates.  Moreover, 
when organochlorine compounds undergo oxidation, they may produce other organochlorine 
compounds that may be more toxic than the parent compound itself.

compared to the single TiO2 or SnO2 system. 
 Shchukin et al. [14] synthesized nanocrystalline bicomponent TiO2-In2O3 powder and studied 
the photodegradation of 2-chlorophenol in water. From the results, it found that photocatalytic 
activity increased with decreasing In2O3. The concentrations of the main aromatic intermediate 
products (chlorohydroquinone and catechol) were considerably lower for TiO2-In2O3 photocatalysts 
than pure TiO2.  On the basis of various characterizations of the photocatalysts, the reasons 
invoked to explain the photocatalytic activity enhancement of  In2O3 included a better separation 
of photogenerated charge carriers, an improved oxygen reduction and an increased surface acidity 
inducing a higher extent of adsorption of the aromatics. 
Barakat et al. [15] studied the photocatalytic degradation of 2-chlorophenol by nanoparticles 
Co-doped TiO2.  The results revealed that Co-doped TiO2 exhibited high activity for 
UV-photocatalytic degradation of 2-chlorophenol.  The efficiencies of the          
2-chlorophenol photodegradation were 93.4% and 96.4% at solution pH of 9 and 12, respectively.  
The presence of Co ion in the TiO2 structure caused a significant absorption shift towards the 
visible region.  
 
Scopes of the study:  
 -Sol-gel techniques will be used to synthesize TiO2 with and without doping. 
 -All the experiments will be conducted at 1 atm. 
 -All the photocatalytic processes will be done with synthetic wastewater using          
2-chlorophenol as an organic probe in a lab-scale reactor at 25°C.

對系統的反應能力造成極大的影響 Fenton 反應對陰離子的存在很敏感，其中以 PO43-對 Fenton
系統的影響最大，主要原因為 PO43-會與系統中的鐵或亞鐵離子產生錯合物，降低鐵離子的催化能

However, in the Fenton chain reactions, the rate constant of equation (1) is between 53 and 76 M-1s-1 
(Rigg et al., 1954; Metelitsa, 1971; Walling, 1975), while that of equation (2) is only 0.01 M-1s-1 (Walling, 
1975). This means that ferrous ions are consumed more rapidly than they are produced. However, the iron 
species need to be removed leading to production of large amount of ferric hydroxide sludge, which 
requires additional separation and disposal processes. 
 
An electrochemical application method in the Fenton processes, named the electro-Fenton method, has 
been reported. Different authors have shown that in aqueous mediums, several non-biodegradable organic 
pollutants can be detoxified in both the Fenton and electro-Fenton processes (Sirés et al., 2007a&2007b; 
Brillas et al., 2003). Furthermore, electro-Fenton methods with UV irradiation are also being developed 
for wastewater treatment, so-called photoelectro-Fenton process (Boye et al., 2002; Flox et al., 2007). The 
process is irradiated with UV light under electro-Fenton conditions. The action of this irradiation is 
complex and can be described as: (i) the production of a greater amount of hydroxyl radicals from the 
photoreduction of Fe(OH)2+, the predominant Fe3+ species in acid medium, by equation (3) and (ii) the 
photolysis of complexes of Fe(Ⅲ) with generated carboxylic acids, as shown in equation (4) (Exposito et 
al., 2007).

Although advanced oxidation technologies for wastewater treatment show high efficiency but work at 
high consume of energy and reagents. AOPs were classified as expensive treatment option, but the cost 
can be minimized and optimized such as integration of chemical and biological treatment processes. 
Partial chemical oxidation of a toxic wastewater may increase its biodegradability up to high levels. 
Therefore, detection of intermediates and biodegradable efficiencies for Fenton, electro-Fenton and 
photoelectro-Fenton processes were investigated in the study.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Chemicals and analytical method 
2,6-DMA (purity, 98%), ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide (purity, 35%) were manufactured by 
Merck. The rest of the used reagents were at least reagent grade. All the preparations and experiments 
were conducted at 30±2 oC. The 2,6-DMA was analyzed by an HP4890 gas chromatography with a flame 
ionization detector and an HP-5 column (0.53 mm in inside diameter, 15 m long). The concentration of 
hydrogen peroxide was analyzed using a titanium sulfate spectrophotometric method (Roland et al., 1997). 
Biodegradability was measured by the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) analysis. TOC was 
determined with an Elementer-liquid TOC  total organic carbon analyzer (Germany). The intermediates 
were detected by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using an HP 6890 gas 
chromatography and an HP 5975 mass spectrometer. DB-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 
0.25 lm film, from J&W, USA) was used. The GC temperature program was as follows: 40 °C for 2 min, 
followed by a 15 °C/min ramp to 280 °C, and hold for 5 min. 
 
Experimental apparatus 
The cylindrical reactor (radius: 6.5 cm and height: 35 cm) was operated at a constant current mode. The 
total volume of the reactor was 3.5 liters. The anode used was a titanium net coated with RuO2/IrO2 
(DSA), and the cathode was made of stainless steel. The double electrode cell had a DSA anode with an 
 133 
 
133
The degradation of 2,6-DMA in the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes follows 
pseudo-first-order kinetics in which the k value is determined by the following expression: 
 
0ln /C C kt=                                  (7) 
 
where C0 represents the initial concentration of the organic compound, and C represents the concentration 
of the organic compound at time, t. The first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined from the slopes 
of the plots of ln([2,6-DNA]t/[2,6-DNA]0) vs. time (R≥0.95). The kobs values for 2,6-DMA degradation in 
each process were determined as shown in Table 1. The degradation rate of electro-Fenton process with 
UV irradiation would be faster than that without it. The photoelectro-Fenton process exhibited a good 
ability on the degradation of organic contaminants in this work. It is due to the fact that ferrous ion 
catalyst can be regenerated through the photoreduction of ferric ions, and then catalyzes hydrogen 
peroxide to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. These findings confirm that UV light contributed 
the additional generation of hydroxyl radicals in the photoelectro-Fenton process.

mM; CDa= 7.6 A/m2; CDc=7.1 A/m2; 48 W UVA irradiation 
 
The role of UVA irradiation in promoting the oxidation efficiency of 2,6-DMA could be clearly illustrated 
with the values obtained in Table 2. The ratios of UVA irradiation promoting the efficiency on the initial 
rates of 2,6-DMA could be obtained as follows: 
 
rPE-F/rE-F = Initial rate of PE-F /Initial rate of E-F               (8) 
 
Where rPE-F represents the initial rate of the photoelectro-Fenton process and rE-F represents the initial rate 
of the electro-Fenton process. The initial oxidation rate by hydroxyl radicals of organic compound in the 
electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes can be expresses as equation (9) and (10), respectively 
(Valentine et al., 1998):

•
− − −− = =                       (10) 
 
where CE-F and CPE-F are the concentrations of 2,6-DMA in the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton 
processes, and the kOH represents the rate constants for the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and organic 
compound. The ratios (rPE-F/rE-F) of UVA promoting the efficiency were 2.01, 2.56 and 2.66 while the 
initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased from 15 to 20 and 25 mM, respectively. It can be 
concluded that the UVA irradiation can promote the 2,6-DMA degradation.

CONCLUSIONS 
In the degradation of 2,6-DMA, the performances of the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton methods 
are significantly superior to that of the Fenton process. Higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations induced 
faster 2,6-DMA degradation, but reduce E. These phenomena may be due to the hydroxyl radical 
scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide. The electro-Fenton oxidation under UV irradiation accelerated 
the degradation rate higher than that in electro-Fenton method. These findings confirm that the significant 
combination (photoelectrochemical/Fenton reagent) led to the formation of additional recycling of ferrous 
catalyst and hydroxyl radicals. The intermediates, aminobenzene, nitrobenzene, 2,6-dimethylphenol, 
phenol and oxalic acid, were detected in this study. IN addition, based on the BOD5/TOC ratios, it reveals 
that 2,6-DMA can be successfully detoxified in the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes. 
Some organic intermediates; i.e. were detected.

Abstract Fenton technologies for wastewater treatment have shown their worthiness in the field of toxic 
compounds elimination. The study explored the effects of hydrogen peroxide concentration and UV light 
on the oxidation processes. However, total mineralization through these technologies is expensive 
compared with biological ones. Therefore, partial chemical oxidation of toxic wastewaters with Fenton 
processes followed by biological units may increase the application possibility of Fenton technologies. 
Consequently, the detection of oxidation intermediates and their biodegradable efficiencies after 
treatment by Fenton, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes were investigated in the study.  
 
2,6-Dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA) was the target compound in this study. Results show that the UV light 
promoting efficiency, rPE-F/rE-F , were 2.01, 2.56 and 2.66 while the initial concentration of hydrogen 
peroxide increased from 15 to 20 and 25 mM, respectively. It can be concluded that the UV irradiation 
promoted the 2,6-DMA degradation significantly. Biodegradability results show that for electro-Fenton 
and photoelectro-Fenton processes, the ratios of BOD5/TOC increased with time of reaction. It means that 
the 2,6-DMA can be successfully detoxified in the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes. 
Some organic intermediates; i.e. aminobenzene, nitrobenzene, 2,6-dimethylphenol, phenol and oxalic 
acid were detected in the different oxidation processes. 
Keywords: 2,6-dimethylaniline; electro-Fenton process; photoelectro-Fenton process 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
2,6-Dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA) is used mainly as an intermediate in the manufacture of azo dyestuffs 
and pharmaceuticals agents. Large amounts of aromatic amine compounds have been produced for the 
synthesis of dyes and released into the environment as waste during their manufacture and use  Although 
2,6-DMA has been produced and applied for a long time, little information is available on its toxicology 
and environmental behavior (Ting et al., 2009). 
 
Recently, more demanding requirements imposed by law to the treatment plants have forced on the 
development of new alternatives, like stronger oxidizing agents or advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). 
AOPs are defined as the oxidation processes that generate hydroxyl radicals in sufficient quantity for 
wastewater treatment (Walling, 1975). The Fenton reaction is a widely used and studied catalytic process 
based on an electron transfer between hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions acting as a homogeneous 
catalyst. The process may be applied on the treatment of wastewaters, sludge, and contaminated soils for 
reducing toxicity, improving biodegradability, and removing odor and color (Lu, 1999&2003). During the 
Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by ferrous ions to produce hydroxyl radicals (Walling, 
1975).

Electro-Fenton process 
Solutions with 1 mM 2,6-DMA (corresponding to 96 mg/L total organic carbon (TOC)) and 50 mM 
NaClO4 as background electrolyte were treated by all Fenton processes for comparison. The ferrous ions 
were added after the pH was adjusted to the desired value. The pH of the solution was not controlled 
during the reaction. In the meantime, the power supply was turned on, and hydrogen peroxide was added 
to initiate the reaction. Fenton reaction was stopped instantly by adding NaOH to the reaction mixtures 
after sampling. The samples were filtered with Toyo 0.45 µm mixed cellulose ester filters to remove 
precipitates before analysis.  
 
Photoelectro-Fenton process 
The irradiation source was a set of sixteen 3 W UV lamps (Sunbeamtech Com) fixed inside a cylindrical 
Pyrex tube (allowing wavelengths λ>320 nm to penetrate).  In addition to all the experimental conditions 
mentioned above, UV lights with maximum wavelength of 360 nm was irradiated inside the reactor, 
supplying a photoionization energy input of 48 W to the solution. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Degradation of 2,6-DMA 
The degradation of 2,6-DMA was explored by electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes. To 
compare the performance of different oxidation processes, three indexes: (i) the stoichiometric efficiency 
(E), (ii) the rate constant (kobs) and (iii) UVA-promoted efficiency (rPE-F/rE-F) were evaluated.  An index, 
E, is defined as below: 
 
2 2E (mM/mM) = [pollutant]/ [H O ]Δ Δ                       (5) 
 
To evaluate the effect of UVA light on the degradation of 2,6-DMA, electro-Fenton and 
photoelectro-Fenton processes were compared at different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (15, 20 
and 25 mM). Table 1 indicates that higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations induced faster 2,6-DMA 
degradation, but reduce E. These phenomena may be due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of 
hydrogen peroxide as shown by equation (6) (Walling, 1975; Rigg., 1954 ).

biodegradability of the treated mixtures. Fig. 1 shows the biodegradability based on BOD5/TOC in 
each process at various reaction times. The BOD test measures organic pollutant concentrations indirectly 
in terms of an equivalent oxygen demand by biological oxidation of the organic matter. However, not all 
organic materials are biologically degradable. Conversely, the BOD/TOC (molar ratio) evaluation 
measures the amount of total organic carbon decomposable by microorganisms. A high BOD/TOC ratio 
means high degree of biodegradation. An increase in the BOD5 of a sample due to the different treatment 
would indicate a greater amenability to biodegradation. Thus, an increase in BOD5/TOC ratio after Fenton, 
electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes were indicative of improved biodegradability due to 
enhancement in the proportion of TOC amenable to biological mineralization.

Reaction pathway for 2,6-DMA mineralization 
Hydroxyl radicals react with organic compounds by the addition to double bonds possessing sufficient 
electron density, by hydrogen abstraction from alkyl groups or hydroxyl groups, or electron transfer. 
Therefore, aminophenols should be generated during the addition reaction with hydroxyl radicals. Brillas 
et al. (1998) reported that different oxidation reactions led to the formation of nitrobenzene and 
benzoquinonimine. Benzoquinonimine produced benzoquinone. The oxidation of phenol leads to 
hydroquinone, which can be further degraded to either benzoquinone. The destruction of nitrobenzene 
with the release of NO3-, benzoquinone and 1,3,4-trihydroxybenzene gives maleic, fumaric and oxalic 
acids.  
 
In this study, the formation of aminobenzene, nitrobenzene, 2,6-dimethylphenol, phenol and oxalic acid 
were detected by GC-Mass in this study. Therefore, the degradation mechanism of 2,6-DMA is proposed 
in Fig. 2.

1) Introduction 
 
Aniline has been used widely as a chemical intermediate to produce many products such as 
polyurethane foam, agricultural chemicals, synthetic dyes, antioxidants, herbicides, pharmaceutical 
products, and explosives (US EPA, 1985). Aniline contaminated wastewaters from these 
manufacturers can pose adverse impacts in receiving waters due to its biorefractory and highly toxic 
properties (Brillas and Casado, 2002). Aniline has also been found in at least 59 of the 1,585 
National Priorities List sites identified by the US EPA (ATSDA, 2002).  In Thailand, aniline has 
been classified as a toxic hazardous chemical by Ministry of Industry which required a special 
control, treatment, and disposal (MOI, 2540). As a result, appropriate and effective treatment 
technologies are needed to purify or clean up these contaminated wastewaters. 
 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are one of the possible alternatives which can provide 
the destruction of refractory and hazardous organic compounds including aniline.  Hydroxyl 
radicals (OH•) generated in the AOPs are extremely reactive, short lived and unselective transient 
species which can readily oxidize organic/inorganic pollutant in water and wastewater and convert 
them into simple, relatively harmless substances.  A number of methods can lead to the generation 
of OH• including H2O2/UV, O3/H2O2, O3/UV, TiO2/UV, and Fenton’s family which is of interest in 
this research. 
 Fenton process is normally initiated by the addition of ferrous (Fe2+) and   hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) which are called “Fenton’s reagent”.  The conventional Fenton process is typically simple 
and effective, and requires no highly capital investment.  Nonetheless, it has one serious 
disadvantage considering on the production of an enormous amount of ferric hydroxide sludge 
which requires further separation and disposal.  The use of fluidized-bed reactor can overcome or 
lessen this problem.  Ferric ions result from Fenton reaction can precipitate and crystallize onto 
the carriers’ surface; hence, significantly reduces the formation of iron puffy sludge (Chou and 
Huang, 1999).  In addition, it was also found that these crystallized iron oxides could catalyze the 
decomposition of H2O2 to generate OH• which enhancing the removal of pollutant (Lin and Gurol, 
1998). 
Although the oxidation of aniline by OH• has been investigated previously by several 
studies (Brillas and Casado, 2002; Sauleda and Brillas, 2001; Brillas et al., 1998; Anotai et al.,

Chemistry of Fenton’s reagent 
 
 Fenton process and its modified versions are being increasingly used in the treatment of 
contaminated water and soil.  The conventional “dark” Fenton process involves the use of an 
oxidizing agent (usually H2O2) and a catalyst (usually Fe2+) to generate highly reactive OH•.  Once 
the Fenton’s reagent is combined together, its sequential reactions are very complicated but well 
specified as shown in Eqs. (1) to (12) (Pignatello, 1992; Lu et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2001). 
 Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + •OH + OH-  k1 = 76 M-1s-1  (1) 
 H2O2  ↔ HO2- + H+   K2 = 1.59×10-12 M (2) 
 Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + HO2•   k3 = 0.02 M-1s-1 (3) 
 HO2•  ↔ O2•- + H+   K4 = 1.6×10-5 M (4) 
 Fe2+ + •OH → Fe3+ + OH-   k5 = 4.3×106 M-1s-1 (5) 
 Fe2+ + O2•- → Fe3+ + O2-   k6 = 1×107 M-1s-1 (6) 
 Fe2+ + HO2• → Fe3+ + HO2   k7 = 1.2×106 M-1s-1 (7) 
 H2O2 + •OH → HO2• + H2O   k8 = 2.7×107 M-1s-1 (8) 
 HO2• + HO2• → H2O2 + O2   k9 = 8.3×105 M-1s-1 (9) 
 •OH + •OH → H2O2    k10 = 5.3×109 M-1s-1 (10) 
 RH + •OH → RH• + OH- → → → products or CO2 + H2O  (11) 
 Fe3+ + 3OH- → Fe(OH)3(s)   Ksp = 4×10-38  (12) 
Although Fe2+ is acting as a catalyst in the Fenton reaction series, it can be seen that the 
consumption rate of Fe2+ in Eq. (1) is almost 3,800 times faster than the regeneration rate of Fe2+ 
from Fe3+ in Eq. (3).  As a result, the pollutant degradation in Fenton process typically proceeds in 
two sequential steps.  In the first step, the pollutant disappears rapidly under sufficient Fe2+ 
leading to the OH• excessive environment whereas, in the slower second step, the oxidation rate of 
the pollutant is controlled by Eq. (3) which is known as “Fenton-like process” (Lunar et al., 2000).  
After treatment with Fenton process, the mixture will be neutralized to comply with the effluent 
standard and the ferric hydroxide will precipitate out as illustrated in Eq. (12).  This ferric 
hydroxide sludge will cause a burden for further separation and disposal which is a major drawback 
for ordinary Fenton process.

5) Literature Reviews 
 
Degradation of aniline by advanced oxidation processes 
 
Sun et al. (2007) determined the appearance kinetic rate constant (kap) for p-nitroaniline 
(PNA) degradation at different conditions by Fenton process including the role of pH, Fenton’s 
reagent, PNA concentration and temperature. The results demonstrated that the oxidation of PNA 
increased rapidly only at the pH value of 3.0. The kap of PNA oxidation increased with increasing 
the dosage of Fenton’s reagent and the temperature. However, the oxidation reaction was inhibited 
at the higher level of H2O2 and decreased with the increasing of initial PNA concentration. 
Anotai et al. (2006) investigated the degradation of aniline at pH 2 by Fenton and 
electro-Fenton processes. The experiments showed that electro-Fenton process was superior to 
ordinary Fenton process with the current impacts of 1.2 to 3.1 for removal efficiency and 1.2 to 5.8 
for degradation rate depending on initial Fe2+ concentration. With current application, aniline 
degradation rate seems to be autonomous from Fenton’s reagent concentrations and approaching a 
half order with respect to aniline. Furthermore, the delay of current supply at the initial stage could 
save up to one-third of the total energy required by the ordinary electro-Fenton process. 
Li et al. (2003) investigated the degradation of aniline solution in alkaline medium of pH 
11.0 by electrocatalytic oxidation using an electrochemical reactor containing a SnO2-Sb2O3-PtO 
anode and a Ti cathode. The results showed that electrocatalytic oxidation was a high efficiency 
process for aniline degradation. A possible mechanism involving OH• reaction with aniline was 
proposed. The first reaction step was the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring to yield dianiline, 
4-anilino phenol and azobenzol, which further oxidized by OH• to yield phenylsuccinic acid. All 
intermediates formed initially were finally decomposed by OH• to form CO2 and H2O. 
Sarasa et al. (2002) ozonated aqueous solution of aniline and p-chloroaniline to investigate 
the reaction and oxidation by-product. The main examined aromatic by-products were nitrobenzene 
and azobenzene when the experiment was performed at acidic pH. All the aromatic by-products 
found were less toxic than the raw materials. 
Sauleda et al. (2001) investigated on the mineralization of aniline and 4-chlorophenol in 
acidic solution by ozonation catalyzed with Fe2+ and UVA light. The initial mineralization rate was 
enhanced as more oxidizing hydroxyl radical being produced in the medium by the catalyzed 
ozonation. Each initial pollutant was degraded at the similar rate in all processes. p-Benzoquinone 
and nitrobenzene were identified as intermediates of aniline oxidation. Nitrate ion attained 
maximum production under UVA irradiation, indicating that the generation of nitrobenzene from 
selective attack of O3 on the amino group of aniline was a photocatalysis reaction. 
Utset et al. (2000) studied on the consumption of oxygen during the degradation of aniline 
by Fenton and photo-Fenton reaction. This study examined the effects of aniline, Fenton’s reagent 
concentrations, pH, temperature, and O2 flow rate on the ratio of O2,consumed to H2O2. The 
experimental results indicated that this replacement took place in a variable extent, but the presence 
  
108
108
from this study indicated that 2-chlorophenol could be effectively degraded by Fenton-liked 
reaction using the goethite as a catalyst at acidic pH. The extent of 2-chlorophenol degradation 
increased with increasing goethite dosage which providing more surface sites for the reductive 
dissolution. 
 
Iron crystallization in fluidized-bed Fenton reactor (FBR) 
 
Hsueh et al. (2006) used a novel supported iron oxide, prepared in a fluidized-bed reactor 
(FBR), as a catalyst for the heterogeneous photoassisted Fenton degradation of azo-dye Reactive 
Black 5 (RB5). This catalyst was much cheaper than Nafion-based catalysts, and could markedly 
accelerate the degradation of RB5 under irradiation by UVA (λ = 365 nm). The effects of the molar 
concentration of H2O2, the pH of the solution and the catalyst loading on the degradation of RB5 
were elucidated. A simplified mechanism of RB5 decomposition which was consistent with the 
experimental findings for a solution with a pH of up to 7.0 was proposed. About 70% 
decolorization was measured and 45% of the total organic carbon was eliminated on the surface of 
the iron oxide at pH 7.0 after 480 minutes in the presence of 0.055 mM RB5, 5.0 g iron oxide/L, 
29.4 mM H2O2, under 15W UVA. 
Chou et al. (2004) determined the effect of operational pH, superficial velocity, specific iron 
loading, and influent H2O2 concentration on the crystallization efficiency of FeOOH. The results 
demonstrated that all these parameters were found to significantly influence the crystallization 
efficiency. Two types of FeOOH catalysts were synthesized: FeOOH I was prepared at pH 3.5, and 
FeOOH II was formed by aging FeOOH I at pH 13.  The crystalline property significantly affects 
the performance of catalytic oxidation of benzoic acid. 
Chou et al. (2004) applied a novel supported iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) catalyst to treat 
benzoic acid by H2O2 using a fluidized-bed crystallization reactor. Four operating variables, 
including pH, specific iron loading, H2O2/Fe2+ ratio, and superficial velocity, have been 
demonstrated to affect the crystallization efficiency. The crystallization reached the maximum 
between pH 3.0 and 4.0. When the specific iron loading increased, crystallization decreased 
gradually and proportionally. The crystallization increased with increasing H2O2 /Fe2+ ratio, and 
then attained a plateau. The superficial velocity must be maintained higher than 30 m/hr to avoid 
the aggregation of suspension solids and formation of flocs that retained in the reactor. 
Chou et al. (2001) applied a novel supported γ-FeOOH catalyst to oxidize benzoic acid 
(BA) in a circulating fluidized-bed reactor (CFBR) by H2O2 and to determine the effects of 
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They found that the degradation rate of H2O2 was 
proportional to its concentration and the BA decomposition depended on both BA concentration 
and H2O2. Conclusively, although heterogeneous catalysis contributed primarily to the oxidation of 
BA at pH 4.4-7.0, the homogeneous catalysis was of increasing importance below pH 4.4.

Objectives: 
 The main objective of this study is to synthesize TiO2 doping with various elements which can 
be activated by the visible-light region by using the sol-gel process. The specific objectives of this 
study are:  
1. To study the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 doping with various elements by using 
2-chlorophenol as an organic probe. 
2. To studies the optical and structural properties of TiO2 doping with elements by using 
BET, TEM, XRD and XPS methods. 
Hypothesis: 
 Doping can expand the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 down to the visible light region. 
 
Theoretical background: 
 
Titanium Dioxide 
Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium (IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring 
oxide of titanium with the chemical formula “TiO2”.  Normally, TiO2 crystallizations have three 
polymorphic forms which are anatase, rutile, and brookite as shown in Figure 1. 
TiO2 is the most widely-used white pigment because of its brightness and very high 
refractive index.  When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and color make it an excellent 
reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones.  TiO2 is also an effective 
opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to 
products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as 
well as most toothpaste.  In cosmetic and skin care products, TiO2 is used both as a pigment and a 
thickener.  This TiO2 pigment is used extensively in plastics and other applications for its UV 
resistant properties where it acts as a UV absorber, efficiently transforming destructive UV light 
energy into heat. 
In the environmental applications, TiO2 is the most preferable photocatalyst because of its 
physical and chemical stability and non-toxicity.

electron-hole pairs because it has wide band gap energy.  The mechanism of TiO2 photocatalysis 
mainly depends on the semiconductor interfacial redox reactions of electrons and holes.  The 
efficiency of TiO2 photocatalysis is low for its application because the photogenerated electron-hole 
pairs recombine rapidly after excitation leading to low charge carrier transfer rate on semiconductor 
surface.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 Schematic of photocatalytic process [2]. 
Three approaches have been made to reduce recombination of photogenerated 
electrons-holes and extend the light absorption of TiO2 down to the visible region.  The first is to 
introduce defects into the TiO2 lattice by doping with transition metal ions.  The second approach 
is to couple TiO2 with other semiconductors in order to enhance the charge separation in the 
photocarriers generation process.  The third possibility is to modify TiO2 by surface deposition of 
noble metal.  
 
Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression [3, 4]  
 Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression is one of kinetic model that used to analyze the 
heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation [5, 6] on the assumption of no competition with reaction 
byproducts.  The photocatalytic oxidation of 2-chlorophenol over TiO2 complies with the 
following equation: 
 
  r  =  - 
dt
]2CP[d  =  
]CP2[K1
]CP2[Kkr
+      (1) 
 
Where “r” is the reaction rate for the oxidation of 2-chlorophenol (M.min-1), “kr” is the specific 
reaction rate constant for the oxidation of 2-chlorophenol (M.min-1), “K” is the equilibrium 
adsorption constant of 2-chlorophenol (M-1), and ”[2CP]” is the concentration of 2-chlorophenol 
(M). This equation is a linear line when plotted between inverse initial rate and initial concentration 
as shown in equation 2.

alkoxides.  In a typical sol-gel process, the precursor is subjected to a series of hydrolysis and 
polymeration reactions to form a colloidal suspension, or a “sol”.  Further processing of the “sol” 
enables one to make ceramic materials in different forms.  Thin films can be produced on a piece 
of substrate by spin-coating or dip-coating.  When the “sol” is casted into a mold, a wet “gel” will 
form.  With further drying and heat-treatment, the “gel” is converted into dense ceramic or glass 
articles.  If the liquid in a wet “gel” is removed under a supercritical condition, a highly porous 
and extremely low density material called “aerogel” is obtained.  As the viscosity of a “sol” is 
adjusted into a proper viscosity range, ceramic fibers can be drawn from the “sol”.  Ultra-fine and 
uniform ceramic powders are formed by precipitation, spray pyrolysis, or emulsion techniques.  
Figure 3 shows the mechanism of sol-gel process. 
 
2-Chlorophenol or ortho-Chlorophenol 
 2-chlorophenol is a benzene that is substituted with hydroxyl group (-OH) in first position and 
covalently bonded chlorine atoms in second or ortho position. 2-chlorophenol is produced by 
electrophilic halogenation of phenol with chlorine. It has a medicinal smell and is a slightly acidic 
liquid.  According to the Notification of the Ministry of Industry No. 6 (1997), 2-chlorophenol is 
classified as a toxic hazardous waste and the industrial effluent standard for 2-chlorophenol is less 
than 1 mg/L.  2-Chlorophenol has been used as a biocide and disinfection and is also used as an 
intermediate in chemical industry.  There are toxic for a wide range of organisms.  
2-Chlorophenol is also used to preserve wood.  It is used as an intermediate in the production of 
pesticides, dyestuffs and preservative. This chemical compound has an appearance as a light amber 
liquid at room temperature.  2-Chlorophenol is toxic to plants, fish and invertebrates.  It spills 
have resulted in fish kills. Exposure to large quantities of 2-chlorophenol impairs algae 
reproduction and primary production.  Biodegradation in soils is lightly to be reasonably rapid 
(day-weeks) and it binds moderately with soil/sediment particles, however for significant spills to 
land, leaching to groundwater may be possible.  Bioaccumulation of 2-chlorophenol appears to be 
moderate. Explosive exposure to 2-chlorophenol can effect if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed 
through the skin.   2-Chlorophenol may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic 
environment.   
It may cause eye and skin damage, respiratory tract irritation, central nervous system effects, liver 
and kidney gastrointestinal system damage.  The molecular structure and MSDS are shown in 
Figure 4 and Table 1 below. 
 
2-Chlorophenol in wastewater 
2-Chlorophenol represents an important water pollutant and has been named as the priority 
pollutant by the USEPA.  The stability of the C–Cl bond in halo-hydrocarbons is responsible for 
their toxicity and persistence in the biological environment.  The main entry routes of 
2-chlorophenol to the aquatic environment are discharges from plants manufacturing it, or from 
plants those employ it as an intermediate in the production of higher chlorinated phenols or

 TiO2 is one of the most preferable photocatalyst because of  its optical and electronic 
properties, stability, low cost and non-toxicity, and can be applied in eliminating persistent organic 
pollutants in air or water.  However, the wide spread technological applications of TiO2 are 
impaired by its wide band gap (3.2 eV) which requires ultraviolet irradiation (wavelength <380nm) 
for photocatalytic activation [9]. Research efforts have been performed to synthesize specific TiO2 
that can be effectively activated by visible light, the main portion of solar light. It was initially 
reported that the doping of various transitional metal ions into TiO2 could shift its optical 
absorption edge from UV into visible light range.   
In 2005, Liu et al. [9] synthesized the visible-light responsive TiO2-V2O5 photocatalyst by 
using a binary sol-gel and in-situ intercalation method.  The photoactivity of the prepared catalyst 
under UV and visible light irradiation were evaluated by decolorization of methylene blue solution.  
The results showed that the composite catalyst displayed             a homogeneous anatase 
phase, and the vanadium pentoxide species was highly dispersed in the TiO2 phase.  The 
composite catalyst responded to visible light because of the narrowed band gap.      
Huang et al. [10] studied Pt/N-codoped TiO2 nano tubes and its photocatalytic activity under 
visible light by photodegradation of Rhodamine B in an aqueous solution. It was confirmed that 
Pt/N-codoped TiO2 nanotubes could be excited by visible light and the recombination rate of 
electron–hole pairs reduced significantly.  The higher visible light activity was due to the 
codoping of nitrogen and platinum.   
Ishibai et al., (2008) [11] synthesized TiO2 photocatalyst with Pt-modification which was 
active to visible-light.  The results showed that Pt on the surface of TiO2 increased photocatalytic 
activity under visible light irradiation, depending on the calcination temperature.  The temperature 
correlated with the light absorption properties of the Pt complex on TiO2 nano-particles.  It was 
found that TiO2 surface structure played an important role in the formation of Ti–O–Pt bonds 
resulting in a large visible light absorbance and high photocatalytic activity under visible light 
irradiation. 
F-doped TiO2 film prepared in the low-temperature was studied by Xu et al. [12].     The 
photocatalytic activity was evaluated by decomposing X-3B under artificial solar light.  The 
results showed that the crystallinity of TiO2 was improved by F-doping.  Fluoride ions could 
prevent the grain growth, and the transformation of anatase to rutile phase was also inhibited.  
F-doped TiO2 film exhibited better photocatalytic activity.  The high photocatalytic activity of 
F-doped TiO2 film may due to extrinsic absorption through the creation of oxygen vacancies rather 
than the excitation of the intrinsic absorption band of bulk TiO2.   
Lin et al. [13] studied the degradation of 4-chlorophenol in TiO2, WO3, SnO2, TiO2/WO3 
and TiO2/SnO2 systems and found that TiO2/WO3 increased the band edge wavelength to 475 nm 
and the gap energy decreased reduced to 2.61 eV.  Although the specific surfaces area of 
TiO2/WO3 decreased due to its larger size as compared to either TiO2 or WO3, the 4-chlorophenol 
degradation efficiency significantly increased as compared to single TiO2 or WO3 system at 435 nm 
wavelength.  The TiO2/WO3 degradation of 4-chlorophenol at 369 nm was inhibited. For 
TiO2/SnO2, the degradation efficiency also suffered at 369 nm, and only slightly increased as

the acid or base catalyst will be added into the solution.  Mixed liquor will be thoroughly mixed to 
undergo hydrolytic condensation for the required period.  After that the resulting precipitate will 
be put into an oven to dry at 110°C for 2 hours. Finally TiO2 powder will be calcined at appropriate 
temperature and maintained at that temperature at selected time interval. The overall procedure of 
synthetic TiO2 is illustrated in the Figure 5 below. 
Doping with tungsten (W/TiO2) 
 The W/TiO2 will be synthesized following the similar procedures as mentioned above; 
however, appropriate amount of Na2WO4.2H2O will be added to the ethanol aqueous solution 
before mixing with the tetra (n-butoxyl) titanium ethanol solution. 
Doping with fluorine (F/TiO2) 
 In this experiment, all procedures will be similar to the case of tungsten doping except 
the NH4F will replace the Na2WO4.2H2O.  
Doping with platinum (Pt/TiO2) 
 In this experiment, all procedures will be similar to the case of tungsten doping except 
the Pt(NH4)4(NO3)2 will replace the Na2WO4.2H2O. 
Optimization of  TiO2 Synthesis 
 -Effect of calcination temperature  
   Calcine temperature will be varied from 150 to 500°C . 
 -Effect of ramp rate 
  During the calcination, the temperature will be raised at different rate from 1 to 4 and 
9°C/min. 
 -Effect of catalyst type 
  From literature survey, it was found that good catalytic property is governed by two 
major opposing physical properties: crystallinity and surface area of the photocatalysts.  The high 
crystallinity helps to prolong the recombination rate, hence, strongly increases the activity of the 
photocatalyst. The high surface area helps to facilitate adsorption of the target molecules onto the 
surface of the catalyst [16].  From these reasons, effect of catalyst type which will be categorized 
into 2 groups will be studied. Firstly, acid group including HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4 and HCl will be 
used. Secondly, base group in which the diethanolanime will be used as the catalyst.

the activity of the synthetic TiO2. The pH and temperature were controlled through out the 
experimental period.  The following scenarios will be performed to determine the effect on TiO2 
property and 2-chlorophenol degradation:

3. Analytical methods

of synthetic TiO2. 
-X-ray diffraction (XRD) will be performed to get the crystal structure of synthetic TiO2. 
-Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)  will be used to determine the surface area and pore size 
distribution of  the synthetic TiO2.  
-UV-VIS spectrophotometer will be used to analyze the absorption spectrographs of the 
synthetic TiO2 photocatalyst. 
-Point of zero charge(PZC) will be determined the surface charge of synthetic TiO2. 
-4-aminoantipyrine colorimetric method will be used to analyze residual concentration of 
2-chlorophenol. One ml of buffer solution, 1 ml of 4-amino-antipyrine solution, 1 ml of potassium 
ferric cyanide solution will be added into the 2-chlorophenol water sample and mixed together to 
produce a color reaction product. The color intensity representing the 2-chlorophenol concentration 
will be measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer.
