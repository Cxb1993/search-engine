Introduction 
In recent years, increasingly more experimental evidences from microscopic techniques1-8 
have demonstrated that polymer crystal surfaces often comprise nodules in the nanometer-sized 
scale. Complementary to imaging studies, X-ray and light scattering observations in a number of 
polymeric materials suggest a precursory ordering process prior to crystallization.9-19 In previous 
scattering studies, density fluctuations before crystallization were typically analyzed in terms of 
correlation function or scattering invariant, which gave only indirect information on morphological 
features before the formation of stacked crystalline lamellae. With a different approach in SAXS 
data analysis for the cold crystallization of a conjugated polymer, poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-2,7-fluorene) 
(PFO),20 we have quantitatively correlated structural features revealed via in-situ small/wide angle 
X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) to nodules observed in earlier scanning/transmission electron 
microscopic (SEM/TEM) images. Specifically, using analytical models of prolate/oblate ellipsoids, 
we have interpreted the observed density fluctuations during cold crystallization of PFO in terms of 
nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanograins. Similar evolution of nodular structure was also 
qualitatively proposed by Konishi et al.21 for the crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) 
upon heating of a quenched mesomorphic glass.  
In spite of the fact that PFO of conjugated (and semi-rigid) backbone with n-octyl grafts 
(providing amphiphilic characteristics in terms of aromatic vs. aliphatic interactions) is not a typical 
polymer, we were nevertheless compelled to comment20 on similarities and differences of the 
proposed nanograin picture as compared to earlier concepts of nanocrystalline blocks by Perlin,22 
mesomorphic precursor by Strobl,18 and spinodal-like cold crystallization mechanism by Ryan in 
particular.19 For a more realistic comparison, here we report results of our recent investigation on 
the cold crystallization of a more traditional polymer of random-coil chains, syndiotactic 
polystyrene (sPS). Using synchrotron-based, in-situ/simultaneous SAXS/WAXS and differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC), we illustrate features of nanograin evolution during cold 
crystallization of sPS. Similarities and (delicate yet intriguing) differences in nanograin size and 
4 
placed in the absolute scale (defined as the differential scattering cross section per unit volume, 
hence in units of cm−1)25 according to established procedures.20,24 Experimental reproducibility was 
generally confirmed by repeated runs using fresh specimens.  
To observe detailed molecular ordering during crystallization, in-situ WAXS/DSC, covering 
most of the Bragg reflections of sPS in a broader q-range of 0.2 to 2.1 Å−1, were further performed 
at the powder X-ray diffraction endstation of beamline 01C (16 keV, λ = 0.775 Å, and sample- 
to-detector distance = 324 mm) at NSRRC. All other experimental parameters were kept unaltered, 
i.e., the same specimen preparation procedure, the same DSC setup, and the same heating rate, etc. 
were adopted.  
 
Data Analysis 
SAXS intensity profiles were modeled according to I(q) = IoP(q)S(q) where P(q) is the 
normalized form factor of the nanograins (i.e., P(0) = 1), S(q) the structure factor, and Io = 
np(Δρ)2V2 the zero-angle scattering intensity, with nanograin concentration np, nanograin volume V, 
and scattering contrast Δρ.20,25,26 The scattering contrast between the nanograins and the matrix was 
assumed constant throughout the cold crystallization process. Comparing to spheres, rods, or discs, 
the ellipsoidal form factor was found to best-fit experimental data. With semi-major axis A and 
semi-minor axis B, the ellipsoid form factor averaged for spatial orientation is given by P(q) = 
μνν∫ d|j|10 21 /)(3  where ν = q [A2μ2+B2(1−μ2)]1/2 and j1 is the spherical Bessel function of the first 
order.25,26   
Drawing analogy from micellar solutions, we have adopted the hard-sphere structure factor 
S(q) = [1−npC(q)]−1 to describe spatial arrangement of nanograins, in which C(q) = 4πσ3ξ−6 {αoξ3 
(sinξ−ξcosξ) + βoξ2 [2ξsinξ−(ξ2−2)cosξ−2] + γ [(4ξ3−24ξ)sinξ−(ξ4−12ξ+24)cosξ+24]} with σ the 
effective diameter, ξ = qσ, αo = (1+2φ)2(1−φ)–4 (where φ is the effective volume fraction), βo = –6φ 
[1–(φ/2)]2(1−φ)–4, and γ = φαo/2.27-29 For a system to reach ordered spatial arrangement (such as the 
6 
composed of primary particles arranged in a self-similar manner,34-37 the mass increases with linear 
dimension r in the form of M(r) ~ fDr  whereas the scattering intensity scales as I(q) ~ fDq− . The 
exponent Df of a fractal system can be a non-integer between 1 and the Euclidean dimension D. For 
instance, Df = 2 for Gaussian chains whereas 2 < Df < 3 for silica aggregates of porous 
structure.34-37 In comparison, conjugated polymers such as PFO or poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'- 
ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) with nematic order in solution-cast films 
exhibit power-law scattering with p ≈ −3.4 as detailed in our previous studies,4-8,20 which 
corresponds to surface-fractal structure34-37 (of a surface fractal dimension of Ds = 6 + p) with 
non-smooth domain-matrix interface.  
Shown in Figure 1b are the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of the sPS specimen 
obtained during heating from 30 to 240 °C. As temperature was raised to the vicinity of the glass 
transition temperature Tg (≈ 95 oC) of sPS, additional scattering (other than that contributed by the 
glassy matrix) emerged in the higher-q region (0.02 to 0.2 Å−1). This additional scattering develops 
with increasing temperature up to 240 °C but changes little in the subsequent 1-hr annealing at 240 
°C, indicating that the kinetic process involved is quickly completed in the time scale of 1 min or so. 
All SAXS profiles shown in Figure 1b contain a common contribution from the glassy state (i.e., 
the power-law scattering in Figure 1a). Removal of this constant scattering of the glassy state from 
the as-obtained SAXS profiles gives the scattering contribution directly related to the structural 
evolution of sPS nanograins. As detailed below, the reduced SAXS profiles clearly reveal features 
of nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanograins.  
Nucleation. Illustrated in Figure 2a are SAXS profiles obtained at 95, 105, and 125 °C with 
the contribution from the glassy matrix subtracted. On the basis of the Guinier approximation26 
(inset of Figure 2a), a common value for the radius of gyration Rg = 2.8 ± 0.2 nm of nanograins can 
be extracted from the three sets of data. To determine the shape of the nanograins, we fitted the 
SAXS profiles with possible form factors of spheres, discs, rods, and ellipsoids. Among them, the 
8 
SAXS profiles; such densification in packing or mesomorphic ordering before development of 
long-range order contributes to the first exotherm (mainly between 90 and 110 °C and hints of 
tailing up to 130 °C) in the simultaneously measured DSC profile in this region (Figure 3b).  
The mismatch in the broader temperature range of steadily increasing nuclear density and the 
narrower range of the main exothermic responses at comparatively lower temperatures is intriguing. 
It may be taken to imply that intermolecular interactions are established first as precursory embryos, 
releasing a major portion of the corresponding crystallization heat. This is followed by further 
adjustments in molecular packing and hence densification, yet releasing only residual heat. Shown 
in Figure 4a are the wide q-range WAXS profiles (separately obtained at the powder X-ray 
diffractometer end-station at Beamline 01C of NSRRC for a similar sPS specimen) that cover most 
of the reflections of sPS, including those two monitored WAXS reflections in Figure 3a. The full- 
range WAXS profiles in Figure 4a indeed support the notion of a frozen-in state below Tg and the 
general absence of long-range positional order within nuclei up to 132 °C. In other words, the 
densification in nuclei of limited size is not yet adequate to result in effective diffraction.  
Growth. As illustrated by the SAXS profiles in Figure 2b, there emerges an interference peak 
near qc = 0.044 Å−1 at 132 °C, which quickly locks into the position of qc = 0.049 Å−1 at subsequent 
temperatures up to 175 °C. Such behavior suggests that, after a quick increase of nanograin 
concentration np up to ca. 130 °C, further heating results in quickly saturated concentration of 
nuclei np ≈ d−3. The fixed mean center-to-center spacing d ≈ 16 nm between neighboring nuclei 
(which corresponds to np ≈ 2.3 × 1017 nanograins/cm3) is estimated from d = 7.884/qc by assuming 
distorted FCC packing of ellipsoids.31 It should be emphasized that this FCC-like ordering of the 
nanograins is different from the stacked-lamellae structure in melt-crystallized polymers, hence the 
center-to-center inter-grain spacing d bears different significance from the long period L in stacked 
crystalline lamellae. 
The scattering invariant (Qinv) increased strongly (by ca. 230 %) with a modest decrease in the 
10
 
the interference peak from qc = 0.047 to 0.035 Å-1 with only a marginal decrease (by 16%) in peak 
width (from 0.015 to 0.012 Å-1), whereas the peak intensity increases strongly with temperature by 
more than threefold (from 0.5 to 1.8 cm–1). We attribute the growing intensity mainly to size 
increase, as revealed by the fitted P(q) and S(q) profiles extracted (inset of Figure 2d). Using the 
same ellipsoidal form factor and hard-sphere structure factor, we fitted respectively SAXS profiles 
at 185, 205, 215, 225, 235, and 240 °C (Figure 2c) to yield ellipsoid dimensions (A, B) = (2.6 nm, 
4.6 nm), (2.8 nm, 4.9 nm), (3.0 nm, 5.4 nm), (3.2 nm, 6.5 nm), (3.7 nm, 6.7 nm), and (3.8 nm, 6.7 
nm), with Rg increasing from 3.2 nm at 185 °C to 4.6 nm at 240 ° C and d from 13 to 17 nm. Values 
of fitted parameters are summarized in Figure 5.  
We have also attempted to fit the SAXS data with stacking of discs as parallel arrays of 
lamellar crystals in the traditional view, using the disc form factor and the arrayed-lamellae 
structure factor42 expressed SAL = N + 2∑ −= 11Nk (N−k) cos(kqL) exp(−k2q2Δ2/2) where N is the 
number of stacked layers and Δ the root-mean-squared fluctuations of long period L. As shown in 
Figure 6, the fitting curves obtained deviate significantly from the data for q > 0.07 Å−1, in dramatic 
contrast to Figure 2c using a combination of ellipsoidal form and equivalent-sphere structure 
factors. This alternative (and more traditional) model of stacked discs may thus be safely excluded. 
Incidentally, the fitted number of layers is around 2 for all curves in Figure 3 (cf. Supporting 
Information), implying very limited order in spatial arrangement of the nanograins and hence 
reaffirming the picture of disordered FCC-like packing. 
Concomitant with the increase in nanograin size revealed via SAXS, gradual sharpening of 
(110), (300), (220), and (211) reflections of α crystals is observed in WAXS profiles given in 
Figures 3a and 4a; this is more clearly illustrated by the evolution of the crystallite dimensions 
(calculated from the reflection peak widths using the Scherrer equation) in Figure 5b. These 
crystallite dimensions match closely with the nanograin envelopes extracted with SAXS (cf. Figure 
5a). 
12
 
the eventless frozen-in stage, and hence trivial. Between T1 and T2 (≈ 130 °C) is the nucleation 
stage, where oblate-like nuclei of similar size emerge and increase in number; concurrently, the 
emergence of the scattering invariant Qinv reflects the increased degree of heterogeneity due to the 
formation of nanograins (Figure 5b). In the growth stage between T2 and T3 (≈ 180 °C), nanograins 
(of fixed concentration np and center-to-center spacing d) grow significantly with decreased shape 
anisotropy (cf. Figure 5a, the smaller B/A ratio than that in the nucleation stage) and develop into 
distorted-FCC-like arrangement, resulting in extensively developed heterogeneity and hence rapidly 
increased Qinv (Figure 5b). Thermal events concerning cold crystallization are essentially completed 
at the end of this stage as revealed by DSC (Figure 3b), although WAXS results (Figures 3a and 4) 
indicate an on-going development in the long-range positional order (Figure 5b).  
Above T3 is the coalescence stage, where the nanograins grow by coalescence, resulting in a 
rapid increase in size, especially along the plane of minor oblate axis. This leads to extensively 
developed lateral dimension up to 14 nm (in terms of the minor axis 2B), with some concomitant 
ordering and lamellar thickening along the chain axis up to ca. 7 nm (in terms of the major axis 2A), 
as given in Figure 5a. This coalescence process does not involve significant changes in the degree 
of heterogeneity Qinv as compared to the growth stage (Figure 5b); nor does it involve any 
discernible thermal event (Figure 3b). On the other hand, the crystallinity Xc,WAXS extracted from the 
WAXS profiles is still strongly increasing in this stage (Figure 4b), with intensified/sharpened (hk0) 
reflections. These results indicate a drastic improvement in the long-range positional order 
transverse to the molecular axis that is consistent with the steadily increasing lateral size up to 14 
nm at 240 °C (Figure 5a). The dynamic process is temperature-dependent and essentially 
instantaneous (within the time scale of 1 min); further annealing at 240 °C results in no discernible 
changes.  
 
Discussion 
Nanograin Images in Real Space. All structural features discussed above correspond to 
14
 
isolated nanograins. In other words, the quasi-2-D environment (and hence easier orientation of 
nanograins)45 in cold crystallized sPS thin films tends to enhance the lateral attachment of 
nanograins into fibrils and even flat-on single crystals. This is consistent with the ease of obtaining 
single crystals via melt crystallization of thin films,4,46-48 in contrast to the traditional view that 
single crystals are supposedly limited to crystallization from dilute solutions.   
Nuclear Size and Chain Rigidity. Reminiscent of the fringed-micelle model49 for 
nanometer-sized crystallites and the more recent bundle model50 for molecular nucleation, we have 
proposed in the previous case of PFO that nucleation during cold crystallization corresponds to 
laterally aggregated stems with the molecular axis oriented along the major axis. As stems 
aggregate, the entangled chains in the immediate neighborhood are expected to become more 
tightly locked: only limited reptational displacement is expected in view of the low mobility of 
chains at temperatures only modestly higher than Tg. Such behavior not only sets a natural limit to 
the nuclear size/shape but also excludes further nucleation in the “knotted” vicinity of an existing 
nucleus. The latter results in subsequent nucleation at sites midway between neighboring nuclei and 
hence the distorted FCC-like structure at the end of the nucleation stage, yielding a clearly emerged 
SAXS peak at the end of the nucleation stage.  
The nucleation scenario appears applicable to the present case of sPS (cf. Figures 2 an 5) as 
well. The nuclear size and shape, however, differ characteristically from that of PFO, originating 
presumably to the differences in chain characteristics between the two polymers. The nuclei of PFO 
(A ≈ 6.4 nm, B ≈ 2.4 nm, and Rg ≈ 3.3 nm) are prolate in shape and generally greater in size as 
compared to the oblate nuclei in sPS (A ≈ 1.3 nm, B ≈ 4.0 nm, and Rg ≈ 2.6 nm). Values of the 
shorter principal axis compare reasonably with corresponding values of the persistence length (lp,sPS 
≈ 1.9 nm and lp,PFO ≈ 8.6 nm).51-53 The greater lateral dimension of sPS nuclei is attributed to the 
higher flexibility (and hence stronger tendency to fold back and re-enter the nucleus) of sPS as 
compared to PFO backbones. The lower value of the nuclear volume (V = 4πAB2/3 = 20.8 nm3) for 
sPS in contrast to the case of PFO (37.4 nm3) may have several contributing factors such as free 
16
 
below the corresponding d values.  
Coalescence Opposed by Matrix Chain Entanglement. Coalescence of neighboring 
nanograins leads to the increased nanograin spacing, as revealed by the characteristic low-q shift of 
the SAXS peak in Figure 2c. As proposed previously, coalescence of neighboring nanograins 
involves orientated attachment via thermal fluctuations. At a given temperature, the final coalesced 
nanocrystallites are kinetically trapped to a size at which the thermal energy can no longer provide 
sufficient rotational freedom for nanograin alignment, as demonstrated by the absence of changes in 
SAXS/WAXS/DSC traces under isothermal annealing once a maximum temperature (240 °C here 
for sPS and 145 °C in the previous case of PFO) is reached.  
Countering the thermally activated rotation in the process is the elastic force from the melt 
matrix of knotted/tightened chains. In the case of PFO, this effect is weak in view of the low 
entanglement density directly; the nematic nature of the melt state is also advantageous for 
coalescence, as chains in the melt and hence nanograins nucleated are largely aligned. Compared to 
PFO, sPS melt is isotropic and highly entangled, resulting in stronger resistance toward nanograin 
rotation in spite of the higher experimental temperatures (up to 240 °C, as compared to 145 °C in 
the previous case of PFO). Consequently, sPS nanograins coalesce modestly with Rg increasing 
from 3.2 nm (at 180 °C) to 4.6 nm (at 240 °C), as contrasted by Rg ≈ 5 nm (at ca. 110 °C) to 10 nm 
(at 145 °C) for PFO. In other words, the higher entanglement density in the present case of 
random-coiled sPS chains results in not only the smaller nuclear size but also the more limited final 
size upon nanograin coalescence as compared to rigid PFO chains.  
 
Conclusions 
In terms of nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanograins, proposed previously for the 
cold crystallization of PFO based on SEM and TEM images and SAXS/WAXS/DSC results, we 
have demonstrated here that a similar nanograin evolution process explains the observed density 
fluctuations during cold crystallization of random-coiled sPS chains. It appears that the
