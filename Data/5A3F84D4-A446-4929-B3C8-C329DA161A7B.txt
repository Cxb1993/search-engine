三、理論基礎： 
Given a negative integer J , J−  is referred to the decomposition level. Let Js  be an N-sample 
sequence a finite 1-D signal with JN −= 2 . For 0 ≥ j > J, let js  and jd  denote two vectors 
consisted of the scaling and wavelet coefficients of the jth level, respectively. By applying the two filter 
matrices H and G defined in [5], the vectors js  and jd  can be obtained from Js  with 
Jj
Jj
−= Hss  and GHsd 1−−= JjJj ,         (1) 
where the column vectors of Jj−H  and GH 1−−Jj  are called the low-pass and high-pass channel 
filters of the jth level, respectively. Note that both Jj−H  and GH 1−−Jj  contain Jj−2  cycles of 
channel filters. In each cycle, the filter coefficients of two adjacent columns have Jj−2 -shift property 
in vertical direction. For convenience, let jA  denote the 
jN −× 2  matrix consisted of the j−2  
column vectors in one cycle of GH 1−−Jj  and 0B  be a column vector of 
J−H . By introducing a 
NN ×  non-recursive filter matrix ]A , ,A ,A ,B[A 1100 −= JL , the overall stages decomposition can 
be performed by 
=d =+ ]d , ,d ,d ,s[ 1100 J- L As J .          (2) 
Eq. (2) is called the 1-D NRDPWT, where 0s  denoting the scaling coefficient at the terminate level is 
the mean of input sequence and jd  contains 
j−2  points of the wavelet coefficients at the jth level. 
With the determinant of A being equal to one, A is a unitary matrix, i.e., tAA 1 =− , where 1A−  and 
tA denote the inverse and transpose of A, respectively. This property implies that the inverse process 
can be also performed with non-recursive form. This can resist the quantization error propagation in 
inverse process. 
The 1-D RRO-NRDPWT 
RROLT is a reversible transformation theorem able to quantitatively analyze the 
word-length-growth effect and minimizing the register word length of 1-D NRDPWT. For convenience, 
let =*d 「d」, where 「d」 denotes the round-off operator that rounds each element of d to the nearest 
integer. From eq. (2), the round-off linear transformation of 1-D NRDPWT can be defined as: 
=*d 「 As J 」and =*s J 「 1* Ad − 」.          (3) 
Eq. (3) will produce two round-off error vectors 'r  and "r  given by 
1* A)dd('r −−=  and −= −1*Ad''r 「 1* Ad − 」,       (4) 
provide a set of non-linear quantization scales for all bands.

Abstract 
 
Maintaining retrieved signal with desired quality is 
crucial for ECG data compression. In this paper, a 
high efficient quality control strategy is proposed for 
wavelet-based ECG data compression. The strategy is 
based on a modified non-linear quantization scheme 
that can obtain a linear distortion behavior with 
respective to a control variable. The linear distortion 
characteristic supports the design of a linear control 
variable prediction algorithm. By using the MIT-BIH 
arrhythmia database, the experimental results show 
that the linear control variable prediction method can 
effectively improve the convergence speed than the 
previous literatures. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Heart disease diagnosis and patient care greatly rely 
on the long time recording and ambulatory monitoring 
of ECG signals. Since the amount of ECG data grows 
so fast, ECG data compression is demanded for 
efficient storage and real-time data transmission. Many 
ECG data compression methods have been proposed to 
have high CR result and well preserve clinical 
information. These methods can be categorized into 
time-domain [1-2] and transform-domain [3-9] groups. 
Recently, the wavelet-based approach, one of 
transform-domain methods, attracts much attention of 
researchers due to simplicity and high compression 
performance. 
In ECG data compression, quality control is an 
important issue that requires a reconstructed signal 
with desired quality guaranteed. The PRD is usually 
used for quality criterion. Data compression methods 
based on fixed bit rate or fixed quantization scale 
design, generally, can not satisfy the requirement due 
to the non-stationary property of ECG segments vary 
with the complex pattern. If the quality of the retrieved 
ECG signal is not guaranteed, the compression system 
will be useless. 
For keeping the retrieved quality, several quality 
control strategies were proposed for ECG data 
compression in the previous literatures [6-9]. The 
retrieved quality is recursively estimated until the PRD 
is reaching in the error bound ( ε ) of the desired 
quality. In these methods, the traditional DWT was 
used for recursive pyramid decomposition process 
which will induce serious error propagation due to 
word-length-growth effect was described in [10]. The 
propagation of high octave quantization error is the 
main factor causing the compression performance 
rapidly descended in high CR situation. 
In this paper, we proposed a high efficient desired 
quality guaranteed scheme based on the 1-D RRO-
NRDPWT ECG data compression system. The 1-D 
RRO-NRDPWT is our previous research [5] that is 
associated with non-recursive 1-D discrete periodized 
wavelet transform (1-D NRDPWT) and a reversible 
round-off linear transformation (RROLT) theorem. 
The use of 1-D NRDPWT and RROLT is to resist 
error propagation effect and normalize the significance 
of octave coefficients, respectively. In this modified 
ECG compression system, the two processes of 1-D 
RRO-NRDPWT and quantization are separated from 
modA in Fig. 3 of [5]. For improving the compression 
performance and advantaging the quality control, the 
modified quantization scheme is proposed in this paper. 
This scheme is formed by the non-linear quantization 
scales with single-variable (QF), and keeps the 
approximately linear relationship with PRD and QF. 
Based on this linear property, we utilize the linear QF 
prediction to control the retrieved quality. By using the 
MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the experimental 
results show that the proposed method can effectively
