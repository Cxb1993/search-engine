increased from ND to 0.88 mg L-1 with the presence of 1 g L-1 of SG. The residual 
1.7% of the TCE could be further remediated via the enhanced bioremediation stage, 
and the TCE concentrations dropped from 0.69 mg L-1 to below detection limit at the 
end of the bioremediation experiment. Results also indicate that the remaining 
KMnO4 had no significant inhibition on bacterial growth and TCE biodegradation. 
Thus, SG flushing and KMnO4 oxidation would not cause adverse effect on 
subsequent bioremediation process using intrinsic bacteria. Thus, complete TCE 
remediation was observed in this study using the three-stage treatment scheme. The 
proposed life cycle design system would be expected to provide a more efficient and 
cost-effective alternative to remediate chlorinated solvent and petroleum 
hydrocarbons contaminated sites.

Soils Pollution of Petroleum Hydrocarbons 
Petroleum products are some of the most widely used chemicals in society today. 
With the massive quantity of fuel required to power automobiles and heat homes, and 
the number of times each gallon of petroleum is stored, transported, or transferred, 
accidents and leakages are unavoidable. Petroleum contamination results from leaking 
aboveground and underground storage tanks, spillage during transport of petroleum 
products, abandoned manufactured gasoline sites, other unplanned releases, and 
current industrial processes. As petroleum contains hazardous chemicals such as Fuel 
oil, diesel, BTEX (e.g., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes), and naphthalene, 
this contamination can be hazardous to the health of plants, animals, and humans. 
 
Among petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants, fuel oil is one of the most widely used fuel 
oils in society today (Gallego et al., 2001). Fuel oil is more difficult to treat compared 
to gasoline and diesel oil due to its characteristics of high viscosity, low mobility, low 
volatility, and low biodegradability. It also contains more recalcitrant and less

technologies (US EPA, 2004). 
 
 
 
 
 
In-Situ Chemical Oxidation Technology 
In-Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) has been applied as an alternate method for soil 
and groundwater remediation, as it offers significant contaminant destruction and the 
possibility of fast treatments, thus minimizing contaminant dispersion and lowering 
the overall treatment cost (ITRC, 2005). ISCO technology is particularly useful in the 
remediation of soils and groundwater polluted by toxic or recalcitrant compounds 
because it is insensitive to their toxicity, aggressive, nonselective and can be coupled 
with a successive biological treatment step. However, ISCO application may be 
difficult owing to problems related to adsorption of organic pollutant to natural 
organic matter, with very slow desorption rates, high reactivity of oxidant towards soil 
constituents and low permeability of the matrix.  
 
Every oxidant has its own unique advantages and disadvantages (Table 2-2). The 
chemical oxidants widely applied in soil and groundwater remediation including 
Fenton’s reagent and Fenton-like, persulfate, permanganate, and ozone have been 
explored as chemical reagents for chemical oxidation with all but persulfate applied to 
chlorinated solvents such as chlorinated alkenes (Levin et al., 2000; Chung et al., 
2002; DeHghi et al., 2002). All of the aforementioned oxidants, except permanganate, 
can generate non-selective free-radicals that might react with a variety of reduced 
compounds in addition to the target contaminant. Permanganate, on the other hand, is 
selective toward the alkenes functional group (C=C) in chlorinated alkenes (Singh and 
Lee, 2001). Discussion and reviews regarding aforementioned the two oxidants are 
depicted in the following sections.

Soil oxidant demand varies with soil type; contaminant oxidant demand is

Natural organic 
matter (NOM) 
Any reduced species in the system can exert a demand for oxidant. Of particular 
importance are NOM, and anthropogenic organic matter. 
and microbiological evaluation of these systems after Fenton's reagent application are 
needed (Miller et al., 1996; Kulik et al., 2006).  
 
Potassium Permanganate in Groundwater Remediation 
ISCO schemes using KMnO4 have been demonstrated as an effective approach to 
degrade chlorinated solvents via an oxidative dechlorination process in contaminated 
groundwater (Li and Schwartz, 2004). There is increasing interest in in-situ treatment 
of chlorinated solvents to utilize oxidant KMnO4 due to the oxidant might migrate by 
diffusion and degrade chlorinated solvents within a low permeability media. Oxidant 
KMnO4 has been well studied for the treatment of water and wastewater and it has 
been investigated under laboratory and field conditions to determine its potential for 
in situ remediation of chlorinated solvents (Schroth et al., 2001; Urynowicz and 
Siegrist, 2005).  
 
A promising alternative for the remediation of sites contaminated by TCE is the 
injection of a KMnO4 solution into the subsurface to chemically transform TCE into 
harmless compounds. This treatment concept has been intensely evaluated in many 
studies over the past decade. Laboratory batch studies have demonstrated that KMnO4 
can completely mineralize TCE, based on the complete recovery of chlorine atoms 
liberated from TCE. The study results indicated that the degradation rate of TCE by 
KMnO4 was influenced predominately by reactant concentrations and temperature, 
and was independent of both ionic strength and pH (Zhai et al., 2005). The reaction 
between TCE and KMnO4 is a complex reaction involving several steps, and the 
overall reaction has been reported as (Huang et al., 1999; Seol and Schwartz, 2000): 
2 MnO4- + C2HCl3 → 2 CO2 (g) + 2 MnO2 (s) + 3 Cl− + H+ 
The production rate of chloride was equal to the degradation rate of TCE for pH 
addition of electron acceptors, electron donors to stimulate naturally occurring 
microbial populations (biostimulation) or could introduction of specific 
microorganisms to enhance the biodegradation of the target compound 
(bioaugmentation).  
 
An alternative to increase the population of contaminant biodegraders in situ is the 
practice of biostimulation. Petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents in 
subsurface environment can be limited by many factors, for example: microorganism 
type, nutrients, oxygen, and contaminant concentrations (Namkoong et al., 2002; 
Atlas and Philp, 2005; Kulik et al., 2006). However, biostimulation is a type of natural 
remediation that can improve pollutant degradation by optimizing conditions such as 
addition of nutrients, oxygen (e.g., H2O2 and pure oxygen), and carbon 
supplementation (e.g., surfactant) into a contaminated system, which increases the 
population of the indigenous microorganisms.  
 
Characteristics of H2O2 that make it a desirable source of oxygen include the 
following: (1) it is relatively cheap and available, (2) it can be added to the 
environment at high concentrations (from 100 to 500 mg L-1), and (3) it does not 
persist in the environment (API, 1987; Kulik et al., 2006).  
different surfactant SG levels were first mixed for 24 h in a rotary shaker.  After 
centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min, the surface tension of the supernatant was 
measured by the tensiometer (Fisher Surface Tensiomat Model 21) consisting of a Du 
Nouy platinum–iridium ring suspended in the surfactant solution by a torsion balance 
(Chu et al., 2005). All of the samples were measured in duplicate. 
 
Life cycle design System Development of TCE in Groundwater 
Surfactant Selection Study 
Three major objectives of this surfactant selection study included: (1) evaluation of 
the surfactant solubilization, (2) evaluation of the effects of applied surfactant on TCE 
biodegradation, and (3) selection of appropriate surfactant for TCE-contaminated 
aquifer flushing. Three non-ionic surfactants were used in the surfactant selection 
experiment including Simple GreenTM (SG), Triton X-100, and Tween 80. Surfactant 
SG was purchased from Sunshine Makers, Inc. (USA), and Triton X-100 and Tween 
80 were purchased from J.T. Baker, Inc. (USA). The properties such as CMC and 
hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) were taken into consideration during the selection 
and were shown in Table 3-1. The HLB [calculated as HLB=% wt. EO (Ethylene 
Oxide) /5] were 13.4 for Tween 80, 13.6 for Triton X-100, and 15.0 for SG. The CMC 
values for Tween 80, Triton X-100, and SG were 0.012, 0.24, and 9.34 mM, 
respectively (Kim et al., 2001). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions. Microcosm experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of TCE 
biodegradation under aerobic conditions. Each microcosm was constructed with 20 
mL of simulated groundwater (mineral medium), 15 g (or 15 mL) of inocula (aerobic 
activated sludge), 5 mL of TCE solution, and surfactant solution in a 70-mL bottle 
sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa (Kao and Lei, 2000). The initial TCE 
concentrations in microcosm bottles were approximately 1 mg L-1 (after equilibration). 
Components of the mineral medium were described in Kao et al. (2001). The medium 
solution was autoclaved before use. The aerobic activated sludge was collected from 
an industrial wastewater treatment plant with influent wastewater containing aliphatic 
chlorinated compounds [e.g., tetrachloroethene, dichloroethene (DCE), dichloroethane] 
and phenol.  
 
Five groups (control, sludge without surfactant, sludge + 1 g L-1 of SG, sludge + 1 g 
L-1 of Triton X-100, and sludge + 1 g L-1 of Tween 80) of microcosms were 
constructed. Control experiment were carried out using groundwater and TCE only, 
and control bottles contained 250 mg L-1 HgCl2 and 500 mg L-1 NaN3, and 
groundwater used for the control groups were autoclaved before use. Aerobic 
conditions were maintained by purging the groundwater solution and bottles with air 
during the preparation. Triplicates microcosms were scarified at each time point (e.g., 
0, 3, 8, 20, 40, 60, 75, 80, 90, and 100 d) during the analysis. Water samples were 
collected and analyzed for TCE and culturable bacterial counts periodically. TCE 
analyse was described in the above section. The spread-plate technique was used for 
microbial enumeration (culturable bacterial counts) following the procedures in 
described Standard Methods (APHA,2001). 
 
 
Groundwater samples were collected periodically (e.g., 0, 20, 40, 80, 120, 200, 250, 
and 300 min). Samples were placed in a Hettich-Zentrifugen EBA 21 Centrifuge for 
30 min at 5,000 rpm. The centrifuged samples were then stored in the dark at 10°C for 
the analysis of TCE, KMnO4 and chloride. TCE analyse was described in the above 
section. Potassium permanganate concentrations were analysed by UV-vis 
spectrometer (ATI Unicom) at 526.5 nm. Chloride concentrations were measured by 
chloride electrode (HORIBA 6560 10C, Japan).  
 
Column Experiment of Surfactant Enhanced Permanganate Oxidation of 
Trichloroethylene in Groundwater 
The column experiment was conducted to assess the potential of different treatment 
schemes to degrade TCE. Oxidant KMnO4 containing surfactant SG was applied to 
oxidize free product of TCE in the column via the surfactant-enhanced oxidation.  
Glass columns were constructed of a Plexiglas cylinder with a wall thickness of 0.30 
cm, length of 30 cm, and an inner diameter of 7 cm. A schematic of the column 
apparatus is shown in Figure 3-1. Washed and sterilized quartz sand (0.2 mm diameter) 
obtained by sieving tested soil was packed at each end (2 to 3 cm depth) to provide 
uniform flow distribution of the groundwater. A nylon mesh of 8 µm pore size on top 
of a wire mesh provided a barrier between the quartz sand and tested soil. The tested 
soil was uniformly placed in the middle layer in small increments and packed down 
using a 450 g weight. Plexiglas plates on either end of the cylinders were secured 
using threaded rods.  
 
One pore volumes of tested groundwater were first pumped into the bottom of the soil 
column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min to ensure that the soil was completely saturated. 
38.1 µM TCE was then pumped into the bottom of the column at 0.2 mL/min using a 
Effect of Surfactant on Contaminant Biodegradation 
Aerobic microcosm experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of TCE 
biodegradation using surfactant SG as the primary substrate under aerobic 
cometabolic conditions. The inocula used in this microcosm study included 
un-contaminated groundwater and tested soil from a TCE-spill site (Site A).  The 
aerobic activated sludge was collected from an industrial wastewater treatment plant 
with influent wastewater containing aliphatic chlorinated compounds (e.g., 
tetrachloroethene, dichloroethene, dichloroethane) and phenol. Each microcosm was 
constructed with 30 mL groundwater (mineral medium), 15 mL of inocula (aerobic 
activated sludge), 5 mL TCE solution, and surfactant (0.1 g L-1 and 1 g L-1 SG) in a 
70-mL bottle sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa (Kao and Lei, 2000). The initial 
TCE concentrations in microcosm bottles were approximately 7.62 µM (1 mg L-1) 
(after equilibration).   
 
Four groups (control, sludge, sludge + 0.1 g L-1 SG, and sludge + 1 g L-1 SG) of 
microcosms were constructed. Control experiments was carried out using 
groundwater and TCE with soil only, and control bottles contained 250 mg L-1 HgCl2 
and 500 mg L-1 NaN3, and inocula used for the control groups were autoclaved before 
use. Aerobic conditions were maintained by purging the groundwater solution and 
bottles with air during the preparation, using a 0.2 µm filter and a syringe. A 
colorimetric redox indicator (resazurin, 0.0002%) was also added to the reactions to 
verify maintenance of aerobic conditions during incubation. Duplicate microcosms 
were scarified at each time point (e.g., 0, 3, 5, 8, 13, 18, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, and 
80 d) during the analysis. TCE analyses were described in the above section. 
 
 
were collected periodically (e.g., 0, 20, 40, 80, 120, 200, 250, and 300 min). The 
samples were centrifuged and then stored in the dark at 10°C before analyses. All 
samples were analysed for TCE, KMnO4, MnO2, and chloride. TCE analysis was 
described in the above section. Both the KMnO4 and MnO2 concentrations were 
analysed by UV-vis spectrometer (ATI Unicom) at 526.5 and 418 nm, respectively. 
Chloride concentrations were measured by chloride electrode (HORIBA 6560 10C, 
Japan).  
 
Stage 3 - Enhanced Bioremediation 
The third stage was the application of enhanced bioremediation technique for the 
remediation of residual TCE after the first two treatment processes. The initial TCE 
concentrations in 100-mL microcosm bottles were approximately 0.69 mg L-1 
(remaining of Stage 2). Aerobic microcosm experiment was conducted to examine the 
feasibility of TCE biodegradation using surfactant SG (approximately 1 g L-1) as the 
primary substrate (remaining of Stage 2) under aerobic cometabolic conditions. In 
addition, the aerobic activated sludge collected from an industrial wastewater 
treatment plant (with influent wastewater containing aliphatic chlorinated compounds 
and phenol) was injected into the microcosm bottles as inocula. Control experiment 
was carried out using groundwater and TCE with soil only, and control bottles 
contained 250 mg L-1 HgCl2 and 500 mg L-1 NaN3. Groundwater used for the control 
groups were autoclaved before use. Aerobic conditions were maintained by purging 
the groundwater solution and bottles with air during the preparation. Triplicates 
microcosms were scarified at each time point (e.g., 0, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 55, 60, 
65, 70, 85, and 90 d) during the analysis. For each datum point, error bars were used 
to stand for standard deviations of triplicate samples. Water samples were collected 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Surface Tension Test 
The results of surface tension investigation to test the property of surfactant SG are 
shown in Figure 4-1. The surface tension of the solution decreased as the surfactant 
SG concentration increased before reaching its CMC. The CMC value of surfactant 
SG was 1 g L-1 (0.1 wt%) that was comparatively higher than those of commonly used 
non-ionic surfactants, namely Tween and Triton.

Life cycle design system development of chlorinated solvents in groundwater 
Surfactant Selection Study 
In general, the surfactants with greater solubilization capability for DNAPLs (e.g., 
TCE) would be selected for contaminated aquifer flushing. Figure 4-2 presents the 
solubilization enhancement of these surfactants for TCE following the order of 1 g L-1 
Tween 80 (26.5%) > 1 g L-1 Triton X-100 (15.4%) > 1 g L-1 SG (9.0%) after 0.2 h of 
CMC: 0.1 wt% (1 g L-1) 
In this study, effects of surfactant addition on the aerobic TCE biodegradation and 
microbial growth were evaluated in microcosm experiments. Figure 4-3 presents the 
removal efficiency of TCE (1 mg L-1) in microcosms containing various surfactants. 
Figure 4-4 presents the growth patterns of culturable bacterial counts with the addition 
of three different surfactants. In Figure 4-3, TCE biodegradation efficiency was in the 
order of [sludge + 1 g L-1 SG (61.1%)] ＞ [sludge + 1 g L-1 Tween 80 (50.5%)] ＞ 
[sludge + 1 g L-1 Triton X-100 (44.3%)] ＞ [sludge (26.7%)] ＞ [control (7.4%)] 
during the first 20 d of microcosm operation. Similarly, TCE biodegradation 
efficiency was in the order of [sludge + 1 g L-1 SG (99.6%)] ＞ [sludge + 1 g L-1 
Tween 80 (96.2%)] ＞ [sludge + 1 g L-1 Triton X-100 (93.3%)] ＞ [sludge (76.1%)] 
＞ [control (9.4%)] after 60 d of incubation. Complete TCE removal was observed 
after 75 d of incubation in microcosms with the appearance of sludge and 1 g L-1 SG. 
Results from this study suggest that the highest TCE degradation rate was observed in 
microcosms with SG addition.  
 
Results from the microbial enumeration experiment show that the culturable bacterial 
counts of the control group were approximately 105 (CFU mL-1) after 100 d 
incubation (Figure 4-4). However, results also show that the microbial population had 
a significant increase in other four groups of microcosms. The observed culturable 
bacterial counts in microcosms with sludge without surfactant, sludge + Triton X-100, 
sludge + Tween 80, and sludge + SG were 108.3, 108.6, 108.8, and 108.9 CFU mL-1, 
respectively, after 100 d of incubation (Figure 4-4). Results indicate that all three 
surfactants would not cause the inhibition of bacterial growth. Because SG could 
significantly enhance the microbial activity and TCE biodegradation rate, it is selected 
as the surfactant for the following bench-scale experiments of the life cycle design 
system. Results also indicate that the applied surfactant was able to desorb the

efficiency versus flushed pore volumes in batch experiment using groundwater and

and the surfactant concentration addition increased.  The significantly increased of 
kobs might be induced by the enhanced solubilization of TCE by surfactant SG. TCE 
degradation rates ranged from 74.1 to 85.7% without addition of surfactant SG while 
the TCE degradation rate increased to ranging from 83.8 to 96.3% with presence of 1 
g L-1 surfactant SG.  
 
The oxidation of TCE by KMnO4 was investigated under different concentrations of 
surfactant SG. With 38.1 µM TCE and 12 mg L-1 KMnO4 initial concentration, TCE 
degradation rates were 83.8, 75.2, and 70.3% for the dosage of surfactant SG as 1, 0.5, 
and 0.1 g L-1, respectively. With the increase TCE (152.4 µM) and KMnO4 (48 mg L-1) 
concentration, TCE degradation rates were increased as 94.9, 94.1, and 84.6% for the 
conditions of 1, 0.5, and 0.1 g L-1 SG addition. These results revealed that surfactant 
SG has significantly increased the degradation rates of TCE by oxidant KMnO4. The 
generation of chloride and the consumption of KMnO4 were further tested to confirm 
these results under the feasible testing condition as 96 mg L-1 of oxidant KMnO4 and 
1 g L-1 surfactant SG.

can be used as an indicator for the oxidation efficiency under TCE dechlorination 
process. The generation of chloride was lower under the condition of without 
surfactant SG addition compared to that added 1 g L-1 SG. In addition, the amounts of 
chloride generation under both conditions were below 114.1 µM (4.1 mg L-1). This 
chloride concentration value was calculated based on the stoichiometry for complete 
TCE degradation. The chloride generated was 6.7 and 2.9 µM for the condition as 
with 1 g L-1 addition and absence of surfactant, respectively, at 120 min of reaction 
time. The chloride generation concentrations were increased to 8.5 and 10.2 µM for 
two aforementioned surfactant SG addition conditions at 300 min. Chloride 
concentrations generated under these oxidation reactions were approximately 
one-tenth of the value (114.1 µM) based on stoichiometry calculation. These results 
indicated that intermittent by-products (e.g., cis-DCE and VC) might not be 
completely degraded under these oxidation reactions. The following column 
experiments might further confirm these results.  
 
TCE degradation by KMnO4 enhanced by surfactant SG was demonstrated in this 
study. The merits of surfactant addition during the remediation of TCE contaminated 
groundwater might include enhancing KMnO4 mass transfer, augmenting oxidation 
efficiency, and preventing MnO2 clogging problem. This study results showed that 
combination of KMnO4 with a proper type of surfactant can improve contaminant 
removal. It is possible to combine surfactant-enhanced solubilization of chlorinated 
solvents with KMnO4 oxidation in a synchronized ‘‘pump-while-treat’’ step (Li, 
2004). The finding of this batch test was further verified by the following column 
studies.

min reaction (Figure 4-10). The consumption rate of KMnO4 was reduced that leads 
to less TCE degradation due to hindering of mass transfer efficiency. Following study 
results might further explain these phenomena.  
 
The ratios of [TCE]/[MnO4-] during two oxidation stages are shown in Figure 4-11.  
Yan and Schwartz. (1999) reported that the complete dechlorination of TCE was 
achieved at the [TCE]/[MnO4-] ratio of 0.06. Additional KMnO4 need to be further 
employed to achieve complete TCE degradation if [TCE]/[MnO4-] ratio is greater than 
0.06. Potassium permanganate was continuously injected in this column test for the 
first ten min to increase the ratio of [TCE]/[MnO4-] and to achieve the expected TCE 
degradation. The concentration of KMnO4 in the outlet of the column was 
approaching 96 mg L-1 of oxidant initially added around 40 min of reaction. The ratio 
of [TCE]/[MnO4-] at this reaction time equals to 0.03 indicating that complete 
dechlorination of TCE via cis-DCE and VC to chloride was achieved. The ratio of 
[TCE]/[MnO4-] was increased from 0.08 to 0.12 for the reaction from 120 min to 300 
min. This result demonstrated that further oxidant KMnO4 needed to be added to 
achieve the complete TCE degradation. Therefore, an additional 48 mg L-1 of KMnO4 
was further injected at 300 min of the reaction. Though the ratios of [TCE]/[MnO4-] 
were ranged from 0.03 to 0.04 indicating the feasible condition for complete 
dechlorination of TCE, the degradation rate of TCE was decreased for this second 
stage of oxidation from 300 min to 560 min reaction. The reduction of TCE 
degradation might be caused by emulsion of surfactant that clogged the pore volume 
of tested soil. The ratio of [TCE]/[MnO4-] can be used as the indicator of the potential 
of oxidation reaction within the soil matrix.

Surfactants are useful for the biodegradation of contaminates because they are able to 
enhance desorption and solubility of hydrophobic compounds. Many studies have 
been conducted to enhance biodegradation of TCE employing surfactant in 
contaminated soil and groundwater (McCray et al., 2001；Boopathy, 2002; Fortin et 
al., 2004; Mulligan, 2005). Two predominant mechanisms including to enhance 
solubility of the substrate for the microbial cells and to interact with the cell surface 
might be responsible for biodegradation enhancement. These mechanisms increase the 
surface of hydrocarbons allowing hydrocarbons substrates to contact more easily with 
microorganisms. Results from this study revealed that the addition of surfactant is a 
feasible method to enhance bioremediation efficiency for TCE contaminated 
groundwater. 
 
TCE degradation rate in the order of 0.1 g L-1 SG (52.0%)＞1 g L-1 SG (48.4%)＞
sludge without SG (29.2%)＞control (10.5%) at 18 d of incubation. Similarly, TCE 
degradation was in the order of 0.1 g L-1 SG (98.9%)＞1 g L-1 SG (97.8%)＞sludge 
without SG (90.3%)＞control (24.7%) at 70 d of experiments. TCE degradation rate 
was not enhanced as the increase dosing concentration equalled to its CMC (1 g L-1) 
of surfactant SG. In addition, the degradation rate was decreased ranging from 1.1 to 
16.8% after 18 d and was level off toward the end of the experiments.   
 
Similar researches (Arostein et al., 1991; Laha and Luthy, 1992; Mulligan, 2005; 
Sanchez et al., 2005) have pointed out that the biodegradation of hydrophobic 
hydrocarbons was not increased proportional to the dosage of surfactant. The reasons 
were attributed to that hydrocarbons entrapped within the micelle due to the increase 
surfactant addition might not be completely available for microorganism to utilize. 
With the addition of surfactant concentration greater than or equalled to its CMC, the

Life cycle design System Development 
Stage 1 - Groundwater and Surfactant Flushing  
Figure 4-13 presents the percentage of TCE removal versus the number of PVs of 
groundwater and SG (1 g L-1) used. Results show that more than 36.2% of TCE can 
be removed after seven PVs of groundwater flushing. Results reveal that the TCE 
removal efficiency increased after flushing with eight PVs of SG. Approximately 
51.4% of the remaining TCE could be further removed in the second phase through 
eight PVs of SG (1 g L-1) flushing (from 7 to 15 PVs). Results from the batch 
experiment indicate that approximately 87.6% of TCE could be removed after 
groundwater flushing followed by biodegradable surfactant (1 g L-1 of SG) flushing. 
Stage 2 - Potassium Permanganate Oxidation  
The merits of surfactant addition during the remediation of TCE-contaminated 
groundwater might include enhancing KMnO4 mass transfer, augmenting oxidation 
efficiency, and preventing MnO2 clogging problem. It is possible to combine 
surfactant-enhanced solubilization of chlorinated solvents with KMnO4 oxidation in a 
synchronized “pump-while-treat” step (Li and Schwartz, 2004).  
 
In this experiment, the generation of chloride and the consumption of KMnO4 were 
further tested to confirm these results under the feasible testing condition as 96 mg L-1 
of oxidant KMnO4 and 1 g L-1 of SG (remaining of Stage 1). The amounts of chloride 
generated due to the reaction of TCE with 96 mg L-1 of KMnO4 in the presence of 1 g 
L-1 of SG are shown in Figure 4-14. Results show that TCE was reduced from 4.96 to 
0.69 mg L-1, and chloride concentation was increased from 0 to 0.88 mg L-1 with the 
presence of 1 g L-1 of SG. The overall TCE removal was around 10.7% within 300 
min of reaction time. Chloride concentration generated under the oxidation reaction 
was approximately one-fifth of the theoretical value (4.02 mg L-1) determined from 
the stoichiometry calculation. Results indicate that intermittent by-products (e.g., 
cis-DCE and VC) might not be completely degraded under these oxidation reactions.  
 
In this experiment, the ratios of [TCE]/[MnO4-] during oxidation stage were shown in 
Figure 4-15. The ratio of [TCE]/[MnO4-] dropped from 0.06 to 0.02 from the start of 
the experiment to 300 min after reaction. This result demonstrates that extra KMnO4 
addition was not necessary to achieve the complete TCE degradation. The ratio of 
[TCE]/[MnO4-] can be used as the indicator of the potential of oxidation reaction. In 
Figure 4-16 and 4-17, the concentration of MnO2 in the supernatant was significantly 
higher in the experiment with the addition of 96 mg L-1 of KMnO4 and 1 g L-1 of SG.

Removal Efficiency of Life cycle designs 
Table 4-3 presents the TCE removal efficiency versus treatment processes. Results 
from the batch experiment indicate that approximately 87.6% of TCE removal could 
be observed after the groundwater and biodegradable surfactant SG (1 g L-1) flushing 
(Stage 1). The chemical oxidation process (Stage 2) was able to remove 10.7% of the 
remaining TCE with the presence of surfactant. The residual TCE (1.7%) could be 
further remediated via the enhanced bioremediation process (Stage 3). Thus, complete 
TCE could be obtained using the three-stage treatment scheme.  
 
 
batch study of surfactant selection study, it was selected for the following 
experiments of the life cycle design system because SG was more biodegradable 
and enhanced the microbial activity of the intrinsic microorganisms. 
2. Application of groundwater and SG flushing is able to remove significant 
amount of TCE from the aquifer. Groundwater flushing can be applied before 
the SG flushing to improve the efficiency of TCE removal and minimize the 
treatment cost.  
3. Results from CSBR and column experiments revealed that combination of 
KMnO4 with surfactant SG can improve contaminant removal. 
4. The amounts of TCE degraded by KMnO4 were significantly enhanced, 
particularly when the surfactant SG concentration equals to its CMC so that the 
TCE solution concentration could be greatly increased due to solubilization by 
surfactant micelles.  
5. Chloride concentrations generated under these oxidation reactions were 
approximately 23.7% (27 µM) of the value (114.1 µM) based on stoichiometry 
calculation. This result indicated that intermittent by-products (e.g., cis-DCE 
and VC) did not completely degrade under these oxidation reactions. 
6. The proposed “life cycle design” scheme would be expected to provide a more 
efficient and cost-effective alternative to remediate TCE-contaminated 
groundwater.

Application of persulfate-releasing biobarrier to remediate petroleum-
hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater 
 
Abstract 
Contamination of groundwater supplies by gasoline and other petroleum 
hydrocarbons released from underground storage tanks (USTs) is a serious and 
widespread environmental problem. Petroleum hydrocarbons contain methyl tertiary-
butyl ether (MTBE) (a fuel oxygenate), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene 
isomers (BTEX), the major components of gasoline, which are hazardous substances 
regulated by many nations. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of 
using a passive in situ oxidation barrier system to remediate gasoline contaminated 
groundwater. The oxidation barrier system included a persulfate-releasing barrier, which 
contained persulfate-releasing materials. The persulfate-releasing materials would 
release persulfate when contacts with groundwater, thus oxidizes the MTBE and 
benzene (target compounds in this study) in groundwater. In this study, the components 
and optimal component ratios of the persulfate-releasing materials were determined. 
Bench-scale experiment was performed to evaluate the persulfate-releasing rate of the 
designed persulfate-releasing materials. Results indicate that the highest persulfate 
releasing rate can be obtained when the mass ratio of persulfate/cement/sand/water was 
1/1/0.16/0.5. Results from the column experiment indicate that approximately 87% of 
MTBE and 99% of benzene could be removed during the early persulfate-releasing 
stage. However, the removal efficiencies for MTBE and benzene dropped to 
approximately 38% and 54%, respectively, during the latter part of the releasing period 
(after 3-month operation) due to the decreased releasing rate of persulfate. Results 
reveal that TBF and TBA, byproducts of MTBE, were observed and then further 
oxidized completely in this study. Results from this study suggest that the appearance of 
Fe (II) would cause the decrease in oxidation rates due to the reaction of sulfate with Fe 
(II). Results show that oxidant reduction potential (ORP) and concentrations of 
persulfate, sulfate, and contaminant would affect the contaminant oxidation rate. The 
proposed treatment scheme would be expected to provide a more cost-effective 
alternative to remediate MTBE, benzene, and other petroleum-hydrocarbon 
contaminated aquifers.

Introduction 
Accidental releases of petroleum products from pipelines and fuel-oil storage tanks 
are among the most common causes of groundwater contamination. Petroleum 
hydrocarbons contain benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEX), 
which are hazardous substances regulated by many nations. Gasoline contains 
approximately 10 - 20% of BTEX, and thus, the residual amount of BTEX persists in a 
pure liquid phase [commonly referred as non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs)] within 
pore spaces or fractures at many gasoline spill sites. The slow dissolution of residual 
BTEX results in a contaminated plume of groundwater. In addition to BTEX, methyl 
tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is another major chemical of concern, which is also toxic to 
humans.

those components were determined in this study; (2) column study was performed to 
assess the potential of using a passive in situ oxidation barrier system. The oxidation 
barrier system included a persulfate-releasing barrier, which contained persulfate-
releasing materials. The slow-released persulfate would oxidize MTBE and benzene in 
aquifers. The persulfate-releasing materials would release persulfate when contacts with 
groundwater, thus oxidizes the MTBE and benzene (target compounds in this study).  
 
Materials and methods 
All chemicals used were reagent grade: MTBE (99.97%, TEDIA Company Inc., 
Fairfield, Ohio), benzene (99.97%, TEDIA Company Inc., Fairfield, Ohio) and sodium 
persulfate (Na2S2O8, min. 99% Riedel-de Haen, Germany) were select as the target 
compounds and the oxidant, respectively. Ferrous sulfate (FeSO4‧7 H2O min. 99.5% 
Riedel-de Haen, Germany) was used to activate persulfate. The cement (type I) and 
sand obtained from Taiwan Cement Corp. Sand was sieved with a 2 mm sieve to 
remove large sand. 
In this study, persulfate-releasing material was designed in an attempt to 
continuously supply oxidant. Preliminary laboratory studies were conducted to identify 
an appropriate composition of the mixture. The mixtures of the persulfate-releasing 
material were prepared by blending persulfate (Na2S2O8), cement, sand, and water 
together at a ratio of 1: 1: 0.16: 0.5 by weight. Cement was used as a binder; persulfate 
was used as oxidant for in situ oxidant supplement. Regular medium filter sand (grain 
size range: 0.4-2 mm) was used to increase the permeability of the mixture. Persulfate, 
cement, and sand were introduced into a 100-mL beaker. Distilled water gradually 
added to the beaker while continuously mixing (15 min) to ensure uniform dispersion of 
the persulfate, cement, and sand. The persulfate-releasing material was then air-dried at 
25℃ for 24 h till the cube-shaped persulfate-releasing material was formed. 
Serum bottles (2 L) were used as batch released reactors. Each serum bottles 
containing persulfate-releasing material was filled with the distilled water and then 
placed at 25±1℃. During the experiments, samples were collected after various time 
points. The water sample was collected and analyzed for persulfate concentration, 
which was represented as sodium persulfate concentration equivalent. Typically, most of 
the experiments were stopped when persulfate concentration were not detected. The 
released persulfate weight was calculated using the equation described in Kao et al. 
(2003). Results were recorded as mg S2O -28 /d/g of cube versus time. 
A laboratory-scale barrier system was developed using a series of continuous-flow 
glass columns: the first soil column followed by the persulfate-releasing material 
column (the second column) and the third column (the second soil column). Each glass 
column was 25-cm long with an inside diameter of 5 cm. The first column (soil column) 
was used to represent the upgradient area of the persulfate-releasing material barrier, 
and it was also used to equilibrate the feed solution with the aquifer materials and 
evaluate the absorbability of MTBE and benzene without the supplement of oxidant. 
The second column was designed to simulate the persulfate-releasing material barrier, 
and it was filled with persulfate-releasing cubes, which were used to supply persulfate. 
The third column (soil column) was used to represent the downgradient area of the 
persulfate-releasing material barrier, and it was applied to evaluate the effectiveness of 
MTBE and benzene oxidation by the released persulfate. The produced byproducts after 
MTBE and benzene oxidation were also evaluated.

material barrier system. Peristaltic pumps (Cole Parmer MasterFlex L/S®) were used to

Figure 4(b) shows the variation in ORP. Overall, ORP increased dramatically (270-
650 mV during 1.4-18.3 PV) because of production of sulfate radicals (Chen et al., 
2009). Measurement of persulfate concentration and ORP varied 1,448-14 mg/L and 
650-369 mV during 18.8-43.5 PV, respective. Because of lower persulfate concentration 
caused sulfate radicals production. The ORP data were used to track the arrival time of 
the persulfate or sulfate radicals in the aquifer. It can also be determined by field 
instrument. It is a measure of the oxidizing environment and can be used to determine 
oxidant movement in the field. Positive values of redox reflect oxidizing conditions and 
generally coincide with the oxidant movement (ITRC, 2005). 
Figure 4(c) presents the variations in pH measurements from the third column 
effluent. Measurements of pH varied 7.24-1.63 during 1.4-15.1 PV. The results indicate 
that the application of in situ persulfate oxidation has the potential to lower the pH of 
groundwater. In a persulfate oxidation system, high concentration of sulfate may be 
produced to form sulfuric acid. For the field application, pH might not be a concern 
because of the natural soil/groundwater buffer and dilution capacity (ITRC, 2005). 
Measurements of pH varied 1.63-7.96 during 15.1-43.5 PV. Because of lower persulfate 
concentration caused sulfuric acid production.  
Figure 4 (d) presents the variations in sulfate concentration and conductivity 
measurements from the third column effluent, respective. Measurements of persulfate 
and sulfate concentration varied 0-21,905 mg/L and 225-10,700 mg/L during 1.4-5.53 
PV, respective. Sulfate concentrations were analyzed in the experiments because sulfate 
production is related to persulfate decomposition and consumption. Measurements of 
persulfate and sulfate concentration varied 21,950-14 mg/L and 10,700-1,179 mg/L 
during 1.4-5.53 PV, respective. The decrease in persulfate and sulfate concentration 
indicates the occurrence of persulfate releasing- material exhaustion of persulfate. 
Figure 5 presents the concentration of MTBE and Benzene and its degradation 
byproducts versus PV in the first to the third column effluents. Results show that no 
significant MTBE and benzene removal were observed in the first column effluents 
indicating that MTBE and benzene cannot be degraded or absorbed of with tested soil. 
The MTBE and benzene removal via the ferrous ion-activated persulfate oxidation was 
approximately 73% and 97% during 1.4-22.9 PV in the second column. The MTBE and 
benzene removal via the ferrous ion-activated persulfate oxidation was approximately 
31% and 49% during 22.9-43.5 PV in the second column. The MTBE and benzene 
removal via the ferrous ion-activated persulfate oxidation was approximately 87% and 
99% during 1.4-22.9 PV in the third column. The MTBE and benzene removal via the 
ferrous ion-activated persulfate oxidation was approximately 38% and 54% during 22.9-
43.5 PV in the third column. These results indicate that high persulfate-releasing 
concentration caused more efficient MTBE and benzene degradation. Results also 
reveal that oxidative power of persulfate was enhanced by ferrous ion because of 
production of sulfate radicals (Liang et al., 2004) Liang et al. (2008) evaluated 
persulfate oxidation for simulated groundwater contaminated with BTEX and reported 
BTEX degradation rate constant of BTEX were found to increase with increased 
persulfate concentrations. Chen et al. (2009) reported the persulfate concentration has a 
linear correlation with MTBE degradation rate and higher persulfate concentration 
caused more efficient MTBE degradation. Replacement of the material at 43.5 PV 
intervals might be required to maintain desired persulfate release rates. The result also 
shows the variation in MTBE and its byproducts, during the oxidation processes. TBF 
and TBA were first detected in the second and third column effluents on 4.03 PV,

persulfate, cement, sand and water. The average persulfate release rates were 14.98 
mg S2O -28 /d/g of material during the 22-day batch experiment period. 
2. Based on the results from the column experiment, the designed persulfate-releasing 
material could release significant amount of persulfate continuously during the 
43.5 PV operation periods. Thus, frequency replacement of this designed material 
is necessary. Replacement of the material at 43.5 PV intervals might be required to 
maintain desired persulfate release rates. 
3. Occurrence of ferrous activated persulfate oxidation in the column experiment of 
the berrier system can be verified by the parameters, which would affect the 
oxidation rate include persulfate concentration, oxidant reduction potential (ORP), 
sulfate concentration, and contaminant concentration. 
4. Significant MTBE (87%) and benzene (99%) removal during the early persulfate-
releasing stage from this system indicates that the proposed persulfate-releasing 
material barrier has the potential to become a cost-effective remediation alternative. 
5. The naturally occurring iron minerals might be used to continuously supply iron 
catalyst to activate the persulfate oxidation process. 
6. This persulfate-releasing material barrier system is an environmentally acceptable 
technology. Results from this study will be useful in designing a scale-up system 
for field application.
