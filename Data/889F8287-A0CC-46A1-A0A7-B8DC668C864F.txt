Introduction and literature survey. 
Crystallization is a vitally important unit operation for separation and purification in the chemical and related 
industries. Although many large-scale crystallization operations are conducted continuously, the majority of 
crystallization operations are conducted batch-wise. In a typical operation, a solution with a high 
concentration of solute is prepared, seeds are added, and then the solubility of the solute is gradually reduced 
(by cooling, solvent evaporation, or some other method). As the solubility is reduced, the solution becomes 
supersaturated and this supersaturation provides the driving force for crystal growth. If the supersaturation is 
maintained within the metastable limit, primary nucleation does not occur, but nuclei may still form via 
secondary mechanisms. Since both the nucleation rate and the crystal growth rate increase with increasing 
supersaturation, there is an inherent tradeoff between these phenomena. 
A commonly studied problem related to batch crystallizer operation is the determination of the optimal 
temperature, saturation concentration, or crystal growth rate trajectory. A survey of the literature shows that 
many different objective functions have been used by different authors to identify saturation concentration 
trajectories. Table 1 provides an incomplete list of journal articles in which an optimal saturation 
concentration trajectory is determined based on an objective that is formulated in terms of the final moments 
of the CSD (either seed crystals, nucleated crystals, or the combination of these). There are more than 10 
different objectives reported in 21 different articles.1–21 Many of these objective functions can be classified 
into one of three broad groups: those that aim to maximize a product average size (either the number-average 
size or weight-average size), those that aim to maximize a moment of the seed crystals or minimize a moment 
of the nucleated crystals, and those that attempt to minimize a coefficient of variation (either the number 
coefficient of variation or the mass coefficient of variation). There is apparently no consensus about which 
objective function is best, and as far as we know, no researchers have investigated the relative merits of 
different objective functions. 
 In this work, we compare different objective functions by comparing the resulting final product crystal 
size distribution when different objective functions are used to determine the saturation concentration 
trajectory. Based on the results, we conclude that the best objective function for almost all applications is to 
minimize the nucleated mass. This objective is closely correlated with maximizing the product average crystal 
size. Minimizing the number of nuclei formed or a total product coefficient of variation leads to an excess of 
nucleated mass and is therefore undesirable. We also show that the product coefficients of variation (mass and 
number) can both be easily improved by adjusting the seed properties. 
Theory 
 The crystallization process model used in this work is the dimensionless model originally presented by 
Ward et al.1 This model has the advantage that it is not particular to any solute-solvent system. The key 
equations are presented here and the reader is referred to Ward et al1 for the details. 
 The population balance equation for a well-mixed batch crystallizer with no agglomeration or 
breakage is:

where ( ),f L t  is the crystal size distribution (CSD) function, and G is the crystal growth rate (m/s). 
Equation 1 is subject to an initial condition based on the properties of the seeds at the beginning of the batch,

Results 
As stated previously, from inspection of Table 1, many of the objective functions considered by different 
authors can be classified into one of three groups: those that aim to maximize a product average size, those 
that aim to maximize a moment of the seed crystals or minimize a moment of the nucleated crystals, and those 
that attempt to minimize a coefficient of variation. As a first step, the best objective within each category was 
identified by determining the trajectory that minimizes each objective function and then comparing the results. 
The results (not shown due to space constraints) show that among objectives that aim to maximize a product 
average size, the best objective is to maximize the volume mean size. Among objectives that aim to minimize 
a moment of the nucleated crystals, minimizing the third moment works the best. Among objectives that aim 
to minimize a coefficient of variation, minimizing the weight coefficient of variation works the best. 
 Finally, the results of the best objective from each category are compared to determine the best one 
overall. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the growth rate trajectories. The trajectory that maximizes the weight 
mean size is similar to the trajectory that minimizes the third moment of the nucleated mass, while the 
trajectory that maximizes the weight COV has peaks and both the beginning and end of the batch. Figure 2 
shows the number and volume crystal size distributions. The trajectory that minimizes the weight COV causes 
excessive nucleation at the beginning of the batch, which leads to a larger nucleated mass and a reduced 
product mass. The trajectories that maximize the weight mean size and minimize the third moment of the 
nucleated crystals perform similarly, but the objective of minimizing the third moment of the nucleated 
crystals performs somewhat better, therefore we recommend this one as the best overall. 
 Regarding the modeling and optimization of systems where the crystal growth rate is size-dependent, 
Figure 4 shows the results of a case-study system where the growth rate is assumed to be size dependent 
according to the expression ( ) 20 11G G a L
a
= + . Parameters for the system are given in Table 3. As α1 
increases, the overall growth rate increases and the growth rate depends more strongly on size. Therefore, as 
α1 increases, the total amount of nucleation decrease, and the width of the seed peaks increases. 
Figures 5 and 6 show the growth rate as a function of time and the final crystal volume size distribution 
for four different trajectories and different values of the size-dependent growth rate parameters α1 and α2 for a 
dimensionless system. The four trajectories are the constant growth rate trajectory, the linear concentration 
trajectory the Mullin-Nyvlt trajectory, and the optimal trajectory (the trajectory that minimizes the nucleated 
mass at the end of the batch). As the values of α1 and α2 increase, the batch performance improves because the 
average growth rate is larger and the width of the seed crystal peak broadens due to the size-dependent growth. 
Other results are similar to those observed previously for the size-independent case: The Mullin-Nyvlt 
trajectory performs nearly as well as the constant growth rate trajectory and the optimal trajectory, while the 
linear concentration trajectory gives an inferior performance. 
Conclusions 
The research funded under National Science Council Project # NSC-99-2221-E-002-188- has been 
substantially completed. We have compared objective functions for seeded batch crystallization and 
determined that minimizing the nucleated mass is the preferred objective. Furthermore, a narrow product 
crystal size distribution can be achieved more easily by manipulating seed properties than by manipulating the 
saturation concentration trajectory. 
 We have also successfully modeled crystallization processes for the case where the growth rate is 
size-dependent. The results show that although the size-dependency causes the product crystal peak to
