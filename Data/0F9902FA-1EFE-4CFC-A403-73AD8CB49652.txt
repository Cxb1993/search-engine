Abstract-- This project presents a new version of constriction
particle swarm optimization (NCPSO) with mutation mechanism
for solving the security-constrained optimal power flow (OPF) with
both the steady-state security constraints and the transient stability
constraints. The objective of SCOPF in considering the valve-point
loading effect of the unit and the operating limits of FACTS devices
is defined not only to minimize total generation cost but also to
enhance transmission security, reduce transmission loss, and
improve the bus voltage profile under normal or post-contingent
states. The proposed NCPSO method involves a new cognitive
behavior of particle; that is, the particle can remember its
previously visited best and worst positions, thus it can explore
effectively the search space. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated for the IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems.
The results show that the NCPSO method has excellent
effectiveness and robustness in solving security-constrained OPF
problems.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE purpose of an optimal power flow (OPF) function
is to schedule the power system controls to optimize
an objective function while satisfying a set of
non-linear equality and inequality constraints. The equality
constraints are the nodal power balance equations, while the
inequality constraints are the limits of all control or state
variables [1]-[2]. The objective function mainly includes
both active-power and reactive-power dispatch optimizations.
Currently, the security and optimality of system operation
has been treated simultaneously for a power system
economy-security control, thus adding to the complexity of
system operation [3]-[5].
Currently, the concept of performing the optimal plan of
power system operation with system security assessment
considered is positively presented to ensure that the system
can secure operation without interruption to customer service
even if the system suffers the contingency impact. For this
reason, the pre-protection strategies of the system and the
security constraints should be taken into consideration
including the transmission capacity limit, bus voltage limit
and transient stability constraints that must be embedded in
the objective function or constraints [5]-[11].
In [3], the security-constrained OPF scheduling can be
undertaken to bring the system to the more acceptable level
of security represented by level 1 or 2. Whether the system
is in a normal operation or contingent state, the security
constraints can ensure that the system can secure operation.
Therefore, the aspect of system economy-security control
can be carried out. In [7], the stability-constrained OPF using
step by step integration (SBSI) method is implemented to
ensure that the system is stable during fault occurrence. In
[8], a multi-contingency stability-constrained OPF using
primal-dual Newton interior point method (IPM) is presented
to guarantee system stability when the system suffers
multi-contingency. In [9], the OPF with transient stability
constraints is equivalently converted into an optimization
problem in the Euclidean space and can be solved by the
standard nonlinear programming technique adopted by the
OPF.
In practical power system operation, the OPF problem
with both continuous and discrete control variables is a
highly constrained, large-dimensional, and non-convex
optimization problem with the valve-point loading effects of
the thermal generator being taken into consideration
[12]-[16]. The continuous control variables are generations
of generators, generator-bus voltage magnitudes, and
var-injection values of static var compensators, while the
discrete ones are transformer-tap settings, phase shifter angle
positions, and var-injection values of switchable shunt
capacitor/reactor. However, installing the suitable FACTS
(Flexible AC Transmission Systems) devices at key locations
to increase the power-transfer capability of transmission
system and keep power-flow over designed routes has also
been developed actively [17]-[19]. An efficient and effective
OPF discretion procedure is needed to help the operators
utilize these discrete controls in a realistic and optimal or
near-optimal manner [5]-[6].
In practical operation, because the reactive power
injection of the switched shunt device depends on the bus
voltage, the specified var-injection value of the switched
shunt device (such as shunt capacitor bank) is difficult to
adjust. A solution to the problem is to select the switched
shunt admittance as the discrete control associated with the
switched shunt devices. It will be capable of obtaining a
good control level.
In this project, an OPF scheduling that considers all
security constraints is presented to ensure that the system can
secure operation even if it suffers contingency impact. The
security constraints including both steady-state security
constraints and transient stability constraints are integrated
into the OPF problem. Thus, the objective of the
security-constrained OPF (SCOPF) with transient stability
constraints is defined not only to minimize the real power
loss of network and improve the bus voltage profile under
pre- or post-contingent states, but also to satisfy the transient

The discriminator of system stability is expressed as (7).
According to previous studies [7]-[9], a real-world power
system is always operated such that any rotor angle of
generator i at any time will not be greater than a threshold
 ( as =100o). If a rotor angle of generator i is larger
than such a threshold  , the generator will be tripped
off-line by out-of-step relay to protect it from being
damaged.
C. Function of Series FACTS Devices
According to their steady-state characteristics of variant
FACTS devices, the function of series controllers, such as
TCPS (Thyristor-controlled phase shifter) and
TCSC( Thyristor-controlled series capacitor), is mainly used
to control the power flow of the lines close to their thermal
limits. The TCPS device can to adjust the phase-angle  to
control the active power flow of transmission line. The
TCSC device can permit to modify the reactance LX of
transmission line. However, the operation limits of both
series controllers must be valid. The models of TCPS and
TCSC are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 Models of TCPS and TCSC
D. Objective Function
Practically, in the security-constrained OPF problem
with both the steady-state security constraints and the
transient stability constraints, there are two kinds of control
variables that are self-constrained. The continuous control
variable is the generator-bus voltage magnitudes ( GV ), while
the discrete ones are the transformer tap-settings ( pT ) and
the equivalent admittance of the adjustable shunt
capacitor/reactor ( hY ). Moreover, the operating limits of
FACTS devices, such as the phase-angle  of TCPS and
the reactance cX of TCSC, should be taken into
consideration. Consequently, the state variables, such as the
voltages of PQ-bus ( iV ), the reactive power output of
generator ( GQ ), the transmission line loading power ( lS )
and the variation in rotor angle of generator ( i) during fault
occurrence, are constrained by adding them as penalty terms
to the objective function. In addition, the constraints of the
valve-point loading effects of generating units are considered,
thus the objective is to minimize the objective function F that
is generalized as follows.

contingency cases.
III. A CONSTRICTION PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
WITH MUTATION MECHANISM
In a PSO system, particles fly around in a
multidimensional search space. The particle swarm works by
adjusting trajectories through manipulation of each
coordinate of a particle. Let xi and vi denote the positions and
the corresponding flight speed (velocity) of the particle i in a
continuous search space, respectively. In an traditional PSO

C. NCPSO-based SCOPF
In general, for power systems with a higher X/R ratio of
transmission line, the fast decoupled load flow (FDLF)
method has superior computation efficiency. To enhance the
effectiveness of the proposed method, the FDLF method is
employed to measure the fitness of the individual for the
acceptable solution quality. The maximum number of
iterations is set to be 30, and the power mismatch accuracy is
0.001 p.u. in the FDLF method.
The search procedures of the NCPSO-based SCORPD
method are shown in Fig. 2, the description is as follows:
1 According to the boundary limits of continuous/discrete
control variables, establish randomly the initial
individuals and the population )( ts using (24), and (25),
respectively.
2 Initialize an array of individuals with random position
and velocities inside the space. Evaluate the fitness
using the FDLF method and the fitness function (27) for
each individual.
3 Compare the fitness with the individual’s previous best
and worst values. If the current value of the i-th
individual is less than the previous best value of the
individual, then set the individual as )(tpbests (i. e.

7i<1000. After line 6-7 tripped, the bus voltage profile of
system shown in Fig. 6(a) reveals that each bus voltage is
within 0.95 pu to 1.05 pu.
For Case II, the NCPSO method has the best fitness of
4113, thus implying a total generation cost of $4004, a
transmission loss of 5.97 MW and a summation of bus
voltage deviation of 0.43 pu. Fig. 5(b) shows the swing
curves of all rotor angles of generator i t during the line
2-6 fault that is also a stable situation. It indicates that
generator G5 has the largest rotor angle i = -83.27560 at t
= 1.3092(s). Figure 6(b) shows the bus voltage profile.

VI. CONCLUSION
An efficient new constriction particle swarm
optimization (NCPSO) for solving the security-constrained
optimal power flow (SCOPF) with both the steady-state
security constraints and the transient stability constraints is
presented. The verifications of the proposed method using
two study systems can be summarized as follows.
 The objective of SCOPF is defined not only to
minimize the real power loss of network and improve
the bus voltage profile under pre- or post-contingent
states, but also to satisfy the transient stability
constraints during fault occurrence. Thus, the operation
point of the SCOPF will enhance obviously the
security of system operation even though the system
suffers a specific contingency impact.
 The proposed NCPSO method involves a new
cognitive behavior of particle; that is, the particle can
remember its previously visited best and worst
positions, thus it can explore effectively the search
space. Compared with the results obtained by the PSO
and EP in terms of solution quality and convergence
rate, our experimental results show that the advantage
of the NCPSO method are superior to those of the PSO
and EP.
 Because the reactive power injection of the switched
shunt device depends on the bus voltage, the specified
var-injection value of switched shunt device is difficult
to adjust. However, in order to select the switched
shunt admittance as the discrete control associated
with the switched shunt devices, it will be capable of
obtaining good control level.
 Due to the FACTS devices in a modern meshed
network can be an alternative to reduce the flows in
heavily loading lines, resulting in an increased
loadability, low system loss, improved stability of the
network, reduced cost of production, and fulfilled the
security requirements by controlling the power flows
in the network. Therefore, a SCOPF problem with
considering the parameter settings of FACTS devices
will be a more valuable investigation.
