1. Introduction 
 
Statistical process control (SPC) is very useful in maintaining an acceptable and stable level of 
some quality characteristics in manufacturing. The most important part of SPC implementation is 
control charting. The effectiveness of the control chart lies in its ability to separate out special 
disturbances (out-of-control data) from inherent variability (in-control data) in a process. In the 
implementation of control charts, the process should be considered out-of-control when points fall 
outside the chart control limits, or when control charts present unnatural patterns (Montgomery, 
1996). Unnatural patterns in control charts can be associated with a specific set of assignable causes 
provided that appropriate process knowledge is available (Western Electric, 1958). Hence, 
effectively recognizing control chart patterns (CCP) can greatly narrow down the set of possible 
assignable causes to be investigated, and significantly reduce the diagnostic search. The 
measurements of each item can be obtained virtually at the point of manufacture by implementing 
automatic data acquisition systems (e.g., machine vision system) (Choudhary et al., 2009), thus 
enabling the development of computerized CCP recognition systems based on traditional analytical 
approaches or data mining (DM) techniques. Many researchers have recently applied DM 
techniques to control chart pattern recognition (CCPR). In particular, neural network (NN) is the 
most frequently used DM tool in the field of CCPR in the recent decade (Cheng, 1997; Ho and 
Chang, 1999; Yang and Yang, 2002; Hwarng, 2004; Guh and Shiue, 2009). In recognition problems, 
NNs can recall learned patterns from noisy or incomplete representations, making NN suitable for 
CCP recognition because unnatural CCPs are usually contaminated by common cause variations. 
The pertinent literature shows that the results of this approach were very encouraging. However, 
nearly all of the studies in this area have assumed that the in-control process data in the control 
charts follow a normal distribution. This assumption violates observations of practical situations. 
Alwan and Roberts (1995) empirically studied 235 control chart applications in industry and 
revealed that the underlying normality assumption is often unsatisfied, especially when individual 
observations are used. It is obviously indicated by this fact that whether the DM-based models 
trained with only normal distributed data are robust to the non-normality of the real process data is 
the key to the feasibility of successfully implementing this technique in a real manufacturing 
environment.  
This research carried out a systematic investigation using simulation to examine whether the 
departure from normality imposes a problem to the DM-based CCP recognizer. The recognizers 
were tested using unnatural patterns generated in non-normal distributions with two performance 
evaluation indices: recognition accuracy and speed. Skewness and kurtosis were used to measure the 
non-normality of the distributions. Numerical results indicate that the neural network based control 
chart pattern recognition models can still perform well in a non-normal distribution environment in 
terms of recognition accuracy and speed. 
 
2. The neural network model for CCPR 
 
Back propagation network (BPN) has been used by most of the applications in the field of NNs 
for SPC (Zorriassatine and Tannock, 1998). The BPN based CCP recognition model adopted herein 
was proposed by Guh et al. (1999). A detailed description of the training and testing of this model 
were given there, with corresponding results. This model is designed to be applied to an automated 
manufacturing process where process data are collected automatically and monitored by a computer 
based pattern recognition system, without the need of human intervention. The model can recognize 
six typical types of unnatural CCPs (i.e. upper shift, downward shift, upward trend, downward trend, 
cycle and systematic), as well as the natural pattern of random variation. All patterns were defined 
according to the text definition in the Western Electric Handbook (1958). 
generated; (4) If Oj (j = 2 ∼ 7) ≥ θ (cut-off value), conclude that an unnatural pattern has been 
detected in the current recognition window. The corresponding time t is the alarm point. Go to Step 
5. Otherwise, increment t by 1, and go to Step 2. Repeat this procedure until an unnatural pattern is 
detected; (5) Trigger the ‘pattern discrimination algorithm’ to distinguish the detected pattern; (6) 
Determine the ARL of the pattern. The ARL is the difference between the alarm point and the 
pattern starting point (25 in this research). 
 
3. Performance evaluation with non-normal distributions 
 
Skewness and kurtosis, the third and fourth moments of a distribution, can be used to quantify 
the degree of non-normality in the data (Kendall and Stuart, 1976). These statistics are often 
calculated by statistical software applications, and also by many spreadsheets. Skewness 
characterizes the degree of asymmetry of a distribution, around its mean. Normally distributed data 
is symmetrical with zero skewness. Kurtosis represents the relative peakedness and flatness of the 
given data, relative to those of a normal distribution. Normally distributed data has a kurtosis of zero. 
The following equations are used to calculate skewness and kurtosis.

This research employs the triangular distribution, which is normally used as a rough distribution 
when random data cannot be collected to determine the actual distribution, to model non-normal 
data. Figure 1 shows a typical density function. The shape of a triangular distribution is determined 
by three parameters – a, b and c. a, b and c are real numbers with a<c<b. a and c are the named 
location parameter and the shape parameter respectively. b-a determines the scale factor of the 
distribution. The density for the triangular distribution is, 
     f(x) =

The mean and standard deviation of the triangular distribution are,

The gamma distribution was also selected to model non-normal data as it offers various shapes 
for the data (as shown in Figure 2). These shapes can be chosen through a shape parameter (α), and a 
scale parameter (β). The data becomes increasingly normal as α is increased. The distribution can be 
considered normal when the α has a value of about 15. The density for the gamma random variable 
is, 
       f(x) =

5. Conclusions 
 
Recognition of unnatural patterns is a critical tool supplementing conventional control charting 
in SPC implementation for determining the potential assignable causes. DM-based techniques have 
been applied in recent year for on-line recognition of unnatural CCP. NN-based model is the most 
frequently used tool in this area and the results are promising. However, nearly all previous studies 
have assumed that the recognizer works with an environment in which the in-control data are 
normally distributed. This assumption is frequently not valid in a real manufacturing situation. This 
research extensively investigates the effects of non-normality on the performance of NN-based CCP 
recognizers. 
Numerical results indicate that the presence of non-normality in the in-control data of control 
charts only slightly influenced the recognition accuracy of the NN-based model, while the 
recognition speed remained robust in non-normal situations. The departure from normality does not 
create a serious problem for the recognizer. It can be concluded that the commonly encountered 
non-normality in the practical manufacturing process data does not damage the usefulness of the 
NN-based CCP recognizer. This could be explained by the fact that what the NNs are seeking here 
are just unnatural features that conform to deterministic equations. This result can be reasonably 
extended to other DM-based CCP recognizers. On the other hand, other statistical based approaches 
(e.g., run rules, zone tests) are not useful in non-normal distribution background, because the 
probability of getting a false signal can not be estimated and controlled in advance due to the normal 
assumption of these approaches. Therefore, this research further confirms the feasibility and 
excellence of applying a DM-based CCP recognizer model in monitoring and controlling practical 
manufacturing processes.

資料探勘技術已被有效地應用在線上辨識管制圖形狀(CCP)的領域中，並比其他
的工具擁有較佳的績效表現(辨識準確度與速度)，在 1991 到 2010 年間，共有

顯示資料探勘模式還是能在製程數據顯示非常態性的狀況下保有良好的辨識精
