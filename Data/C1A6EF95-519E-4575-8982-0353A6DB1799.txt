ZrNxOy thin films were deposited on 304 stainless steel substrates by reactive magnetron 
sputtering.  The specimens were produced by s puttering a Zr target at 500°C and the reactive 
gases were N2 and O2 at various flow rates (ranging from 0 to 2 sccm).  The purpose of this 
study wa s t o i nvestigate the effect o f oxygen flow r ate on  the phase tr ansition and 
accompanying mechanical properties of the ZrNxOy thin films.  The oxygen contents of the thin 
films in creased significantly w ith increasing oxygen flow rate.  X-ray D iffraction ( XRD) 
revealed that the characteristics of the films can be divided into three zones according to the 
major p hase with i ncreasing o xygen content: Zone I (ZrN), Z one II (Zr2ON2) a nd Zone III 
(m-ZrO2).  The hardness of the ZrNxOy films decreased with increasing oxygen content due to 
the formation of the soft oxide phase.  Modified XRD sin2ψ method was used to respectively 
measure the residual stresses of ZrN, Zr2ON2 and m-ZrO2 phases.  The residual stress in ZrN 
was r elieved a s t he oxygen content i ncreased. Z r2ON2 and m -ZrO2 were found t o be  l ow 
residual stress phases.   Compositional depth profiles showed that there was a ZrO2 interlayer 
near the f ilm/substrates interface for all samples except the m ononitride Z rN specimen.  
Contact angle was used as an i ndex t o assess the wettability of  the f ilm on  substrate.  The 
contact angles of ZrN, Zr2ON2 and m-ZrO2 on stainless steel were indirectly measured using 
Owens-Wendt method.  The r esults showed th at ZrO2 possessed t he l owest wettability on 
SS304 among the three ZrNxOy phases, indicating that the ZrO2 interlayer may account for the 
spallation of the ZrNxOy films after salt spray tests.

oxygen content, t he structure ev olves from Z rN t o multiple oxynitride phases ( ZrN +  
monoclinic-ZrO2 (m-ZrO2)) [8,9]. In subsequent studies Huang et al. [10,15] confirmed that 
the phase separation of ZrN and m-ZrO2 occurs in the ZrNxOy films, and the film properties are 
strongly a ffected by t he ph ase separation.  For Z rNxOy-coated s tainless steel, t he p hase 
separation w as f ound to s ignificantly influence t he c orrosion r esistance o f the c oated 
specimens [9]. 
Although our previous studies [8,9] showed that the mechanical properties and corrosion 
resistance o f ZrNxOy films are c omparable t o t he t raditional m ononitride c oatings, t he film 
deposition was by using a less popular HCD-IP technique.  Magnetron sputtering is a  more 
versatile and convenient method and has been widely applied in industry.  Most of the previous 
studies on ZrNxOy used d.c. or  r.f. magnetron sputtering t echniques.  To c ompare t he p hase 
transition and the accompanied mechanical properties of the ZrNxOy films on s tainless s teel 
substrate by HCD-IP, unbalanced magnetron sputtering (UBMS) was chosen as the deposition 
method in this study. 
The phase transition of ZrNxOy with increasing (N2+O2) flow rate has been extensively 
studied by Carvalho et al. [5,6,11].  ZrNxOy thin films were deposited on glass, Si and metal 
substrates at room temperature by d.c. magnetron, and the compositions of the thin film varied 
with gas flow rates.  The structure of the ZrNxOy thin film was categorized into four different 
zones: Zone I was ZrN phase with some texture changes, Zone II may have a structure similar 
to Zr3N4, but with some probable oxygen inclusions within nitrogen positions, Zone III was 
similar to Zr2ON2 with some oxygen atoms occupying some of  t he nitrogen positions, and 
Zone IV was monoclinic-type ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) structure.  On the other hand, there were only 
two ph ases indentified, namely ZrN and m-ZrO2, for t he ZrNxOy thin films d eposited b y 
HCD-IP [8,9], and Zr2ON2 was obtained after the specimens were annealed [10].  Furthermore, 
substrate temperature may also affect the phase transition of ZrNxOy thin film.  Signore et al.

steel remained intact after 500-hr salt spray test and showed excellent corrosion resistance.  It is 
possible that the a dhesion o f t he c oatings may be di fferent due t o deposition method.  T o 
understand the difference in adhesion, the wetting of ZrNxOy on stainless steel was examined in 
the present study by measuring the contact angles of three ZrNxOy phases. 
The objectives of this research were to investigate the influence of oxygen flow rate on 
phase transition and related mechanical properties of ZrNxOy thin films and to evaluate the 
wettability of different phases of ZrNxOy on stainless steel substrate.  In this study, ZrNxOy thin 
films were deposited on AISI 304 stainless steel at 500°C by unbalanced magnetron sputtering, 
and oxygen flow rate was chosen as the controlling parameter. 
2. Experimental Procedures 
ZrNxOy thin films w ere d eposited by a reactive dc unbalanced magnetron s puttering 
system.  The substrate material was commercial AISI 304 stainless steel with dimensions of 
14×14×0.8 mm3.  Before de position, t he substrates were und ergone ul trasonic cleaning 
progressively in acetone and ethanol each for 5 minutes. Then the substrates were blown dried 
with N2 gas and immediately placed into the coating chamber.  
The coating chamber was evacuated down to a base pressure of 2.67×10-4 Pa (2×10-6 torr).  
Then, the substrate was heated up to 500±5°C.  A circular zirconium target (99.9% in purity) 
with a diameter of 7.62 cm was used and the target-to-substrate distance was 12 cm.  Prior to 
deposition, t he su bstrate wa s p re-sputtered by Ar i on for 5 minutes a t an Ar (99.9995% in 
purity) flow rate of 50 sccm and a substrate bias of -1000 V.  During deposition, the cathode 
current was maintained a t 0 .55 A.  A negative bias of 60 V  was a pplied on to the s ubstrate 
rotating at a constant speed of 12 rpm.  The working pressure was ranged from 0.16 Pa (1.3 
mtorr) to 0.19 Pa (1.4 mtorr).  The working gases consisted of Ar and N2 (99.9995% in purity) 
gases at fixed flow rates of 35 sccm and 5 sccm, respectively, and O2 at a flow rate ranging 
from 0 to 1.5 sccm.  The deposition time was 120 minutes.  The designation of the specimens is

issue was solved by calibrating the AES data using the results of RBS analysis.  Since the N/Zr 
ratio o f mononitride ZrN determined from RBS was more accurate than t hat from AES, the 
N/Zr ratio of AES for ZrN was first calibrated using the result of RBS from the same specimen, 
and t hereafter the N /Zr r atios o f all o ther ZrNxOy specimens could be obtained from A ES 
analysis.  Then, the O/Zr ratio could be determined by subtracting the N/Zr ratio by AES from 
the (N+O)/Zr ratio by RBS.  The contents of Zr, N, and O could thereby be ca lculated from 
N/Zr a nd O /Zr r atios.  The el emental contents obt ained from AES a nd R BS were the bulk 
average values, which may be different from the surface compositions determined by XPS. 
The thickness of ZrNxOy film on 304SS was determined from the sputtering time of the 
AES depth profiles.  The sputtering time was correlated to the film thickness by carrying out 
AES measurement on a ZrNxOy thin film deposited on Si wafer, where the film thickness was 
measured from the cross-sectional image of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
The evolution of t he c rystalline structure a nd texture of t he Zr NxOy films w ere 
characterized by XRD θ/2θ scan. The XRD measurements were c arried out using a 
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.5405 Å.  The operating power was 50 
keV ×  200 m A.  For θ/2θ scan, 2θ was ranged from 20° to 65° with a scanning rate of 4 
degree/min.  The phase ratio of ZrN, Zr2ON2 and ZrO2 phases was estimated by the equation 
2 2 2ZrN Zr ON ZrO
iI
I I I+ + , where Ii is the integrated intensity of the corresponding phase peak 
and i represents ZrN, Zr2ON2 or ZrO2.      
The hardness o f the de posited f ilms was measured b y a  na noindenter e quipped with a  
Berkovich indenter head attaching on an atomic force microscope (AFM).  The applying loads 
ranging from 2 mN to 4 mN were employed and the indentation depth was controlled at 40±5 
nm, which was less than one-tenth of the film thickness to avoid the substrate effect.  A quartz 
standard sample was used to calibrate the instrument and the accuracy was within 10%.  The

The contact angles between test liquids and substrates were determined using a FTA 200 
Contact Angle System from FirstTenAngstroms.  Four kinds of liquids with known surface free 
energy, including distilled water, 50% ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol and glycerin, were used 
[23].  Test liquid drops, each with a volume of 2 ml, were applied to the surfaces of ZrN (S00), 
Zr2ON2 (S75), ZrO2 (S200), and 304 stainless steel.  The contact angles between test liquids 
and the s pecimens were acquired by the measuring de vice, w hich were t hen u sed i n the 
Owens-Wendt m ethod to calculate the contact angles between thin films a nd stainless steel 
substrate. 
The corrosion endurance of the ZrNxOy films was evaluated b y 500-hr salt sp ray test. 
ASTM standard B117 and G85 were adopted as the specifications for the salt spray test [24]. 
3. Results 
The variation of element contents from XPS with oxygen flow rate is shown in Fig. 1.  It 
can be seen that t he contents of Zr a nd N decrease while O  increases w ith the i ncrease o f 
oxygen flow rate.  The integrated intensities of the ZrN, ZrNO, Zr2ON2, and ZrO2 peaks from 
the deconvoluted Zr-3d spectra are used to calculate the bonding fraction.  Fig. 2 shows the 
bonding fraction with respect to the oxygen flow rate.  T he variation of the bonding fraction 
can be divided into three zones: Zone I is predominated by ZrN bonding with the oxygen flow 
rate ranging from 0 to 0.38 sccm, Zone Ⅱ is the mixing of Zr2ON2 and ZrO2 bondings where 
the oxygen flow rate ranging from 0.5 t o 1.25 sccm and ZrO2 bonding dominates Zone Ⅲ 
where the oxygen flow rate raging from 1.5 to 2 sccm.  It can be seen that as the oxygen flow 
rate i ncreases, t he fraction of  ZrN bond decreases while t hat of ZrO2 bond i ncreases.  T he 
fraction of Zr2ON2 bond increases as the oxygen flow rate increases from 0 to 1 sccm, and then 
decreases with oxygen flow rate ranging from 1 to 2 sccm.  
The compositional depth profiles of the ZrNxOy thin films are determined using AES, as 
shown in F ig.3 ( a, b, c, d ).  The film/substrate interface is d efined to  be lo cated a t the 
12 
 
two methods are fairly consistent and show the same trend. 
Table 1 also lists the thickness of the ZrNxOy films.  Since the deposition t ime was 120 
minutes for all specimens, the film thickness may represent the deposition rate.  However, due 
to the films with different compositions and structures, the increase of film thickness may be 
from the formation of lower de nsity compounds, and therefore i t is not certain t hat the 
deposition rate increases as the film thickness increases.  It can be seen that the film thickness 
increases with increasing oxygen flow rate up to 1.25 sccm, and then decreases as the oxygen 
flow rate reaches 1.50 sccm.  The decrease of film thickness for the last two specimens could 
be due to Zr target poisoning by oxygen gas.    
Fig. 4  depicts the XRD patterns for all samples.  As shown in Fig. 4(a), ZrN (111) and 
(200) peaks, corresponding t o t he N aCl structure of Z rN phase [ 25], a re obs erved for t he 
samples deposited at oxygen flow rates ranging from 0 to 0.38 sccm.  Among the samples, 
strong (200) preferred orientation is found except specimen S38.  ZrN (111) and (200) peaks 
still a ppear i n S38, but t he i ntensity r atio of ( 200)/(100) i s much smaller t han t hat of t he 
previous three specimens.  In addition, a small Zr2ON2 (222) peak appears, which corresponds 
to the bixbyite structure of Zr2ON2 phase [26].   
It is a lso found that a  br oad peak can be deconvoluted between Zr2ON2 (222) and ZrN 
(111) peaks, as shown in Fig. 5(a).  Since the peak is quite diffuse, it is difficult to be identified 
with a distinct crystal structure.  A few studies have discussed the possible species of this peak.  
Some authors [4-6,11,16-18] reported the phase could be Zr3N4 with dissolving oxygen, while 
our pr evious studies [10,15] suggested that the peak could be m-ZrO2(111).  H owever, both 
findings are not conflicted.  For those studies claimed the diffuse peak is Zr3N4(O), the supply 
of reactive gases N2 and O2 in deposition was from one f ixed-ratio mixing gas[4-6], or two 
separated gases [11], or water vapor and N2[16-18].  The common condition was that N2 gas 
flow could be increased during deposition, which favors the formation of Zr3N4(O).  On the

Fig. 2, and the phase transition boundaries for the three zones are consistent in both results of 
XRD and XPS. 
Fig. 7 s hows the hardness of ZrNxOy films with respect to oxygen flow rate.  T he film 
hardness i s ranged from 10.0 t o 22.6 GPa a nd i s divided i nto t hree zones according t o t he 
previous XRD and XPS results.  In Zone I, the hardness decreases rapidly from 22.6 GPa to 
13.2 GPa as the oxygen flow rate increases from 0 to 0.25 sccm.  Then, the hardness goes up to 
18.0 GPa at 0.38 sccm O2.  In Zone II, the hardness decreases linearly from 15.9 GPa to 10.6 
GPa with increasing oxygen flow rate.  In Zone Ⅲ, the oxygen flow rate further increases while 
the hardness changes slightly, from 10.9 GPa to 10.0 GPa.  In general, the hardness of ZrNxOy 
thin film is significantly affected by the oxygen flow rate.  
The residual stresses in ZrNxOy thin films and substrates can be individually determined 
by XRD using the modified sin2ψ method [19].  Fig. 8 shows the variation of  compressive 
residual stresses of ZrN, Zr2ON2 and ZrO2 phases with different oxygen flow rates.  
The residual stress in the ZrN phase was determined from ZrN (220) peak for the samples 
in Zone I, and the Young’s modulus E of the sample S00 obtained from nanoindentation was 
used for the calculation of residual stress.  As shown in Fig. 8, the compressive residual stress 
in the ZrN phase decreases from 5.22 to 1.41 GPa with increasing oxygen flow rate.  There is a 
significant decrease of stress, from 5.22 GPa to 2.14 GPa, as the oxygen was first introduced at 
a flow rate of 0.13 sccm. 
Zr2ON2 (222) peak was used to determined the residual stress in the Zr2ON2 phase for the 
samples deposited at oxygen flow rates ranging from 0.38 to 2 sccm, and the Young’s modulus 
of sample S75 from nanoindentation was adopted to calculate residual stress.  Fig. 8 shows that 
the stress decreases distinctly from 2.82 GPa to 1.49 GPa as the oxygen flow rate increases 
from 0 .38 t o 0 .5 sccm. For t he r emaining samples, t he compressive stress i n Z r2ON2 phase 
almost levels off in a range from 1.55 GPa to 1.08 GPa.  Noticed that the compressive stress in

500°C using a UBMS system.  Higher deposition temperature was chosen to compensate the 
lower ionization efficiency of the UBMS system.  The controlling parameter was the oxygen 
flow rate ranging from 0 to 2 sccm, while maintaining a fixed nitrogen flow rate at 5 sccm.  It 
can be seen that the oxygen and nitrogen contents of the thin films are significantly affected by 
the oxygen flow rate (Fig. 1), wh ich leads to the occurrence of the phase transformation and 
phase separation.  
The bonding fraction by XPS (Fig. 2)  and t he phase ratio by XRD (Fig. 6) show the 
consistent results, indicating that the phase transition with increasing oxygen flow rate can be 
divided i nto t hree zones which ar e respectively dominated by Z rN ( Zone I), Z r2ON2 + 
amorphous ZrO2 (Zone II) a nd m-ZrO2 (Zone III).  The formation of dominant pha ses in the 
corresponding z ones was commonly a ttributed t o t he c ompetition b etween k inetic a nd 
thermodynamic factors [ 5,7-9,11,16-18].  M ost p revious s tudies used reactive gases with a 
large N2/O2 ratio (flow ratio or gas content ratio).  Under this condition, the impingement flux 
of nitrogen on the substrates is higher than that of oxygen and hence the formation of nitride 
phase i s k inetically favored than t hat of oxide phase.  O n t he other h and, ox ide i s the 
thermodynamically preferred phase than nitride due to stronger affinity of Zr with oxygen than 
with nitrogen [28].  When oxygen flow rate is much smaller than that of nitrogen, the kinetic 
factor dominates the reaction and ZrN can form even in the existence oxygen.  As the oxygen 
flow r ate increases, t hermodynamic factor be comes prevailed, a nd t hereby t he dominated 
phase changes to high oxygen content phases such as Zr2ON2 and m-ZrO2.  
Comparing the phase transition of ZrNxOy occurred in this study with previous literatures, 
it is found that the formation of different phase is influenced by not only the ratio N2 to O2, but 
also by substrate temperature, substrate material and deposition method.  The phase transition 
sequence in this study is similar to those reported in the previous literatures where the ZrNxOy 
thin films were prepared by magnetron sputtering; as oxygen gas content or flow rate increases, 
18 
 
excited states due to high ionization efficiency in HCD-IP [30,31].  Those high energy particles 
may elevate the energy state of the reactants and thereby lowering the activation barrier and 
enabling the formation of m-ZrO2 at lower oxygen flow rate.  On the other hand, in the UBMS 
processing, the energy of the sputtered metal atoms is much lower than that in HCD-IP such 
that the more stable Zr2ON2 phase with lower activation barrier is produced. 
The variation of the compressive residual stress in ZrN, Zr2ON2 and m-ZrO2 phases with 
oxygen flow rate is shown in Fig. 8.  In general, the residual stress decreases with increasing 
oxygen flow rate in the three phases, which is consistent with the findings in our previous study 
[8,9].  In z one I, t he excess oxygen a toms i n ZrN i nterstitial sites may be absorbed by t he 
formation of the oxide or  oxynitride phases (ZrO2, ZrNO, and Zr2ON2) thereby relieving the 
stress in ZrN.  In the next zones, the residual stresses in the major phases, Zr2ON2 and ZrO2, are 
lower than that in ZrN phase.  The decrease of residual stress in oxynitride and oxide phases 
may be attributed to less dense structure and hence the interstitials due to ion-peening effect 
can be more ea sily accommodated.  Notice that the residual stresses of the specimens before 
reaching the zone boundaries (samples S38 and S125) are higher than those of the major phases.  
This may be derived from excess N atoms inducing lattice distortion.  The residual stresses in 
the two phases were determined individually.  For sample S38, stress in Zr2ON2 is significantly 
higher than that in ZrN.  Since excess N a toms may remain in the Zr2ON2 lattice due to the 
phase transition from ZrN(O) to Zr2ON2, these defects lead to distortion in the Zr2ON2 lattice 
and increase the residual stress.  Similar reason may account for the increase of st ress in the 
m-ZrO2 phase in sample S125.  The m-ZrO2 lattice may contain excess N atoms in the ZrO2 
lattice causing lattice distortion and thereby increasing residual stress. 
The hardness of the ZrNxOy thin films ranges from 10.0 to 22.6 GPa, as shown in Fig. 7.  
The film hardness is associated with the structure and defects of the film [1,2].  Therefore, the 
variation of film hardness can be understood by  considering the d ifferent phases an d t he 
20 
 
layer 3 is the ZrNxOy film. The atomic percentage of O/Zr in region 1 is about 2, but there is no 
ZrO2 peak in the XRD patterns for the samples deposited at O2 flow rates lower than 1.25 sccm; 
therefore, layer 1 is likely to be amorphous ZrO2.  
Comparing the thickness of oxide interlayer in the two AES profiles (Figs. 9(a,b)), it can 
be found that the interlayer is formed in the early stage of deposition and keeps growing during 
deposition.  Previous study [ 7] r eported t hat when using N2/O2 as the reactive g ases i n 
depositing ZrNxOy films, since the formation free energy of ZrO2 is much less than that of ZrN, 
the Zr adatoms may consume the oxygen atoms to form as much ZrO2 as possible while the 
remaining Zr atoms form ZrN.  This is consistent with our finding that Zr reacts with oxygen 
first to form oxide phase at the beginning of deposition.  
In addition, the oxide layer thickness is 36 nm at 30 min and 69 nm at 120 min, indicating 
that the thickness is approximately parabolically p roportional to time.  For t he pa rabolic 
oxidation, the growth of oxide film conducts not only cations but also electrons and oxygen 
anions, so that the location of the plane at which film growth occurs is a competition between 
the cation transport and anion transport [31].  Therefore, if the diffusion of anions is faster than 
that of cations, the plane of the film growth will lie at the metal/oxide interface.  In Fig. 9 (a), it 
can be seen that the concentration profile of oxygen decrease initially from surface and then 
increase from minimum to the maximum at oxide interlayer while that of Zr keeps constant.  
This suggests that the growth of oxide interlayer is controlled by the diffusion of oxygen from 
surface through the film to the ox ide interlayer.  I t has been reported that ZrO2 is not a good 
diffusion barrier for O atoms [33] and our previous studies found that ZrN can dissolve large 
amount of oxy gen [ 8,9].  Z r2ON2, with similar structure as ZrO2 and containing a nion 
vacancies may have similar diffusion characteristics for O atoms.  Therefore, it is reasonable 
that the growth of oxide interlayer may be due to the diffusion of oxygen through the ZrNxOy 
film and the interlayer thickens outwards from the interface between ZrNxOy film and the oxide 
22 
 
continuously due to the O atoms diffuse from surface through the film to the interlayer during 
deposition. 
The contact angle between two materials, deriving from the relative surface energy, can be 
a convenient and effective index to evaluate the wettability of a thin film on a specific substrate.  
In this study, the ZrNxOy thin films including ZrN(S00), Zr2ON2(S75) and m-ZrO2 (S200) have 
been deposited on SS304 substrate.  Contact angle measurements were carried out for each thin 
film material on stainless steel substrate.  The results listed in Table 2 show that θ  /SS304ZrO2  is 
86.3° and θ SS304 / ONZr 22  is 54.5° while θZrN/SS304 is 0°.  This suggests that the wettability of ZrO2 
and Z r2ON2 on SS304 is lower than t hat of Z rN.  In addition, θ
2 / ZrOZrN
 and θ
222  / ZrOONZr
 are 
36.4° and 0°, respectively, indicating that the wettability of both ZrN and Zr2ON2 on ZrO2 is 
better than that of ZrO2 on SS304. 
The AES depth profiles delineate that there is a ZrO2 interlayer between the ZrNxOy film 
and substrate, which exists in almost all the samples except samples S00 (ZrN).  Concomitantly, 
salt spray tests show that all the ZrNxOy thin films were peeled off except the mononitride ZrN 
sample (S00).  This indicates that the ZrO2 interlayer may lead to the spallation of the ZrNxOy 
films, which is consistent with the large contact angle between ZrO2 and SS304.  On the other 
hand, the extremely small contact angle between ZrN and SS304 also agrees with the good film 
wettability o n sample S00.  Therefore, t he contact a ngle can s erve as an effective index t o 
assess the wettability between two materials. 
5. Conclusions 
1. The dominant phases in the ZrNxOy films are in a sequence of ZrN, Zr2ON2, and m-ZrO2 
with increasing oxygen flow rate.  The characteristics of the films can be divided into three 
zones: Zone I (ZrN), Zone II (Zr2ON2) and Zone III (m-ZrO2).  
2. In general, the residual stress decreases with increasing oxygen flow rate in the three major 
phases.  The residual stresses in the Zr2ON2 and ZrO2 phases are lower than that in ZrN

Abstract
Nanocrystalline ZrNxOy thin films were deposited on P-type (100) Si wafers using unbalanced 
magnetron sputtering (UBMS) system. The reactive gases consisted of nitrogen and oxygen, where 
oxygen with various flow rates accompanying nitrogen at constant flow rate were introduced into 
the deposition process. The purposes of this study were to investigate the phase transition due to 
changing oxygen flow rate and the related variation of structure and properties of the thin films. As 
the oxygen flow rate increased, the oxygen content of the film determined using X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) increased significantly. The major phases observed from X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) were in an order of fcc-ZrN, c-Zr2ON2, t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 with increasing 
oxygen content. The characteristics of the films could be categorized into three zones respectively 
predominated by ZrN (zone I), Zr2ON2 (zone II) and ZrO2 (zone III). The properties of the films 
including electrical resistivity, mechanical and optical properties were substantially affected by the 
oxygen content in the film and the predominant phase in the three zones. The residual stresses of
ZrN, t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 phases were measured separately using modified XRD sin
2ψ method. The 
residual stress in ZrN was relieved with increasing oxygen content. High residual stress in the 
t-ZrO2 may be ascribed to the lattice distortion due to the insertion of excess interstitial anions. 
Zr2ON2 and m-ZrO2 were found to be low stress phases, and might relieve the residual stresses of 
the films. Experimental results implied that t-ZrO2 may be stabilized at room temperature by the
nitrogen interstitials in the octahedral sites along the c-axis. The increase of nitrogen content in 
ZrO2 phase may lead to the increase of refractive index and the decrease of band gap.
4methods. By introducing oxygen into the optimized nitride-deposition process, the composition and 
crystal structure of the ZrNxOy films can be controlled and thereby varying the mechanical, optical 
and electrical properties of the oxynitride films. 
The film hardness of the ZrNxOy films simply is related to the microstructure and deposition 
conditions. In general, the hardness deceases with increasing oxygen content.  Our previous 
studies [19,20] found that the maximum hardness appears at a low oxygen flow rate, which may
derive from solution hardening of O atoms or precipitate hardening of oxide. Similar findings have 
been published by Carvalho [21] and Vaz et al. [22]. They suggested that lattice distortion caused by 
oxygen insertion may inhibit the mobility of dislocations and result in the increase of film hardness.
Huang et al. [19] observed that the average residual stress of the ZrNxOy film is close to the 
stress in ZrN phase at relatively low oxygen contents, while it is dominated by the stress in m-ZrO2
phase when the oxygen content increases to a certain amount. Carvalho et al. [21] reported that the 
relatively high compressive stress in ZrNxOy film is suggested to be due to the interstitial insertion 
of oxygen atoms in ZrN lattice. As oxygen content increases, the newly forming oxide phase 
strongly prevails over other oxygen-doped nitride phases. Thus, they believed that the relief of 
compressive residual stress is due to increasing oxide phases.
It has been reported that the refractive index (n) of ZrNxOy films decreases with increasing 
oxygen content (or decreasing nitrogen content) [13,23,24]. This was attributed to the changes in 
crystal and electronic structures caused by the variation of nitrogen and oxygen contents in the films. 
In addition, the band gap (Eg) of the film increases with decreasing refractive index, which is 
consistent with Moss rule [25]. Coloration of ZrNxOy thin films is also strongly affected by the 
oxygen content, which can be divided into two kinds: intrinsic color and extrinsic color. The 
intrinsic color was derived from the selective absorption of the incident light by the electron in the 
material and the reflection of the remaining light spectra. On the other hand, the extrinsic color is
due to the interference of with different wavelength, which may be influenced by surface roughness 
and thickness of thin films. The increase of oxygen contents might change both the band gap and 
6sputtering (UBMS) system. The substrate material was 4-inch P-type Si (100) wafer with a 
thickness of 0.525 mm. Before deposition, the Si substrate was undergone ultrasonic cleaning 
sequentially in acetone and in ethanol, each step for 5 minutes. Then the substrate was blown dried 
by N2 gas and immediately placed into the coating chamber. 
The coating chamber was evacuated down to 2.7×10-4 Pa (2×10-6 torr) for preventing 
contamination during deposition process using a pumping system consisting of a turbo-molecular 
pump and a rotary pump as forepump. Then, the substrate was heated up to 500C. Prior to 
deposition, the substrate was pre-sputtered by Ar ions for 5 minutes at an Ar (99.9995% in purity) 
flow rate of 50 SCCM and a substrate bias of -1000 V to remove the surface oxide layer. The 
working pressure was about 2×10-1 Pa (1.5×10-3 torr) during pre-sputtering.
After pre-sputtering, high purity working gas Ar and reactive gas N2 (99.9995% in purity) were 
introduced to deposit ZrN at flow rates of 35 SCCM and 5 SCCM, respectively. For depositing 
ZrNxOy, O2 gas was added at a flow rate ranging from 0.13 to 1.5 SCCM. The total gas pressure 
was ranged from 1.60×10-1 to 1.87×10-1 Pa (1.2×10-3 to 1.4×10-3 torr) and the pumping speed was 
maintained at 500 l/min during deposition. A 3-inch sputter gun with a Zr target (99.2% in purity) 
was operated at 0.55 A using constant-current mode. The target-to-substrate distance was 12 cm, 
and the substrate rotational speed was 12 RPM. The sputter gun was tilted at an angle of 25° from 
the normal of the specimen. The substrate bias voltage was -90 V and the deposition temperature 
was maintained at 500C. The deposition duration was 120 min for each batch of sample. The 
sample designation, from 000 to 150, represents the oxygen flow rate with a unit of 10-2 SCCM, as 
listed in Table 1.
The chemical compositions of ZrN and ZrNxOy thin films were measured by a PHI 1600 X-ray 
photoelectron spectrometer. Prior to analysis, the specimen was pre-sputtered by 3 kV Ar+ ions for 3 
minutes to eliminate the surface oxide. A computer program XPSPEAK 4.1 was used for the 
deconvolution and fitting of the multiplex XPS spectra. The background of the spectra was 
8attached on a Digital atomic force microscope (AFM) with a Berkovich diamond indenter head. In 
order to avoid the substrate effect and ensure undergoing deformation, the residual indentation 
depth should be kept about one-tenth of film thickness. The accuracy was within 11% calibrating by 
the quartz standard sample. The precision of each reported average value was within 11% from ten 
indentations for each sample. The Young’s modulus E can be obtained from nanoindentation by the 
following equation
2 21 (1 ) (1 )i
r iE E E
    ,
where ν (νZrN= 0.186 [33], νZrO2=0.33 [34]) and νi (= 0.07 [35]) are the Poisson’s ratios of the thin 
films and diamond indenter tip, respectively, and Ei (=1141GPa [35]) and Er are the Young’s 
modulus of the diamond indenter tip and the reduced modulus from nanoindentation, respectively.
The residual stress determined by optical curvature measurement can be calculated by Stoney 
equation [36]. The modified XRD sin2ψ method [37] was adopted to separately measure the 
residual stress in ZrN, tetragonal-ZrO2 (t--ZrO2) and monoclinic-ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) phases using a 
4–circle diffractometer with psi-goniometer. Nine tilt ψ angles, 500, 420, 330, 230, and 00, were 
selected. The grazing incident angle of X-ray was set at 20. The residual stresses of ZrN, t-ZrO2 and 
m-ZrO2 phases can be calculated from the linear fitting of the following equation

t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 phases, respectively.
The surface roughness of the ZrN and ZrNxOy films were measured with an atomic force 
microscope (AFM) operated at contact mode. Electrical resistivity was measured using a four-point 
10
3 (a), ZrN film (sample S000) possesses a columnar structure with a column width less than 60 nm. 
Fig. 3 (b) shows the image of sample S013, where the columnar structure is refined with a smaller 
column width, about 20 nm, than S000. The morphology of sample S038 shown in Fig. 3 (c) can be
divided into to two parts: a fine grain structure in the lower part, and a cone-shape column structure 
in the upper part of the film. Fig. 3 (d) shows the images of sample S150. The distinct column 
structure appears again in the sample with a fine column width less than 20 nm.
Fig. 4 depicts the XRD patterns for all specimens. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), ZrN (200) [38] is the 
predominant peak for the pure ZrN sample S000. For the samples S013 and S025, ZrN (111) 
prevails over ZrN (200) and relatively small t-ZrO2(101) [39] and m-ZrO2 [40] peaks appear. In 
addition, small Zr2ON2 [41] peaks are found in the sample S025. The results indicate that the 
preferred orientation of ZrN phase in the three samples S000, S013 and S025 is shifted from ZrN 
(200) to ZrN (111) with increasing oxygen content. Fig. 4 (b) shows that samples S038 and S050 
consist of ZrN, Zr2ON2, t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 phases, and the intensity of t-ZrO2 (101) peak increases
significantly. The t-ZrO2 (101) and ZrN (111) peaks are unsymmetrical and can be deconvoluted 
into four peaks, t-ZrO2 (101), Zr2ON2 (222), Zr2ON2 (321) and ZrN (111). In Fig. 4 (c), ZrN peaks 
are no longer existed, and the Zr2ON2 peaks also disappear for the samples S100, S125 and S150. 
For the samples S075, S100 and S125, t-ZrO2 (101) is the major peak with very high intensity. It is 
also observed that a significant phase transformation from t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2 occurs in the sample 
S125, where the m-ZrO2 ( 111 ) peak emerges, and then becomes prevailed over t-ZrO2 (101) in the 
sample S150.
Fig. 5 shows the phase ratio obtained from the integrated intensity of XRD peaks with respect to 
oxygen flow rate. Similar to the bonding fraction in Fig. 2, the phase ratio can be divided into three 
zones according to oxygen flow rate, where the major phases are ZrN, Zr2ON2, ZrO2 and the 
corresponding oxygen flow rate regions are (I) 0 to 0.25 SCCM, (II) 0.38 to 0.5 SCCM and (III) 
0.75 to 1.5 SCCM, respectively. Compared with Fig. 2, it is found that the trend of phase ratio is 
12
using UV-visible spectrophotometer for samples containing ZrO2 as major phase. It can be seen that 
these films with interference phenomenon have extrinsic color and the absorption edges of the three 
samples, S075, S100 and S125, appear at wavelength shorter than 400 nm. In addition, as the 
oxygen flow rate increases, the absorption edge shifts towards shorter wavelength (higher energy). 
This finding is consistent with the previous results by Venkataraj [13] and Mohamed [24], implying 
that the band gap increases with increasing oxygen flow rate.
Fig. 8 depicts the refractive index with respect to oxygen flow rate at a wavelength of 650 nm. 
For the samples in zone I and II, the absorption of light is too high to obtain the refractive index of 
the films. In zone III, the refractive index decreases from 2.6 to 2.2 as oxygen flow rate increases. 
The decrease of refractive index and the increase of band gap of the films agree with the trend 
predicted from Moss rule [25]. 
4. Discussion
From the bonding fraction and the phase ratio (Figs. 2 and 5) of the ZrNxOy thin films, the 
experimental results can be categorized into three zones, predominating by ZrN (zone I), Zr2ON2
(zone II) and ZrO2 (zone III) in different range of oxygen flow rate. In addition, due to the phase 
transformation of ZrO2, the zone III can be further divided into two parts: one is dominated by 
t-ZrO2 and the other by m-ZrO2 phases. Therefore, there are four phases associated with three zones, 
where structure transition occurs as the oxygen content of the thin film varies.
4.1 Phase Separation and Phase Transformation
The structure of the film may be determined by the competition between kinetic and 
thermodynamic factors. The nitrogen flow rate was maintained at 5 SCCM, always higher than the 
oxygen flow rate ranging from 0 to 1.5 SCCM, and therefore the impingement flux of N2 was 
higher than that of O2 on the deposited film. As a result, the formation of ZrN is kinetically favored 
than that of ZrO2. On the other hand, the affinity of Zr with O is higher than that with N [42]; 
14
and Zr2ON2, one can realize the similarity between these two species. Both crystal structures are 
cubic with Zr atoms locating at face center and corner sites. The major difference is the position of 
anions. For ZrN, the anions are at the octahedral interstitial sites, while for Zr2ON2, the anions are at 
the tetrahedral sites with two anion vacancies. Considering a ZrN unit cell, as the ratio of (N+O)/Zr 
is larger than 1, the number of octahedral sites is obviously insufficient to contain the anions. 
Without changing the basic FCC lattice, the best alternation is to use the 8 tetrahedral sites. In 
addition, the high deposition temperature may provide energy to overcome the energy barrier for 
pushing anions from larger octahedral sites to smaller tetrahedral sites. However, the Zr2ON2 exists 
in sample S075 without ZrN, indicating that Zr2ON2 may also form independently as the oxygen 
content increases. In summary, the Zr2ON2 in zone II may be transformed from ZrN by atom 
rearrangement and/or directly form due to increasing oxygen content.
4.1.3 Zone III
In this zone, the major phase is ZrO2 including two polymorphs t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, which 
suggests that ZrO2 is thermodynamically favored at high oxygen flow rate. As shown in Table 1, the 
(N+O)/Zr ratio is ranged from 1.5 to 1.9, less than 2, implying that the understoichiometric ZrO2
structure may contain vacancies and N defects.
Separation of ZrO2 phase has been reported when ZrNxOy films were annealed above 600C
[42]. The mechanism was suggested to be that heat treatment supplies thermal energy for oxygen 
atoms to segregate at grain boundaries, and thereby facilitating the formation of m-ZrO2 or t-ZrO2.
ZrO2 can grow separately or transform from Zr2ON2. Since the structure of Zr2ON2 is similar to 
ZrO2, the transition from Zr2ON2 to ZrO2 is possible as the O content increases, which can be 
carried out by replacing N atoms with O atoms and filling the anion vacancies with O atoms in the 
tetrahedral sites of Zr2ON2. It is noticed that the stress in t-ZrO2 is much higher than that in m-ZrO2. 
In table 1, closely examining the c/a ratios of samples S075 and S100 (1.44 and 1.46, respectively),
one can find that the ratios are larger than that of pure t-ZrO2 (1.43 from JCPDS [39]). This 
16
is due to the decrease in N content, and the lowering of residual stress is the cause but not the effect 
of phase transformation.
4.2 Residual Stress
4.2.1 Zone I
Our previous study [19] found that residual stresses of the ZrN and ZrNxOy thin films decrease 
with increasing oxygen content. For those films containing lower ratio of m-ZrO2, the average 
residual stress of thin film is mainly due to the residual stress in ZrN. In addition, the residual stress 
in m-ZrO2 is lower than that in ZrN phase, which is attributed to lower ion impingement resulting 
from the lower electrical conductivity of m-ZrO2.
In Table 1, as the oxygen content increases, the electrical resistivity of the film increases, due to 
the decreasing ratio of conducting nitride to dielectric oxide. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 6, the 
average residual stress from ion-peening decreases. The stress in the major phase ZrN displays a 
similar trend with the average stress, but is generally lower than the average stress. Examining the 
stress in pure ZrN (sample S000), there is a 0.6 GPa difference between the optical and XRD values, 
which may come from the uncertainty in elastic constants of ZrN. However, the disparity of the two 
stress measurement methods in specimens S013 and S025 may be also contributed from the 
formation of second phases, which consumes the excess O atoms from ZrN and thereby relieving 
the stress in ZrN.
4.2.2 Zone II
In this zone, Zr2ON2 is the major phase with a phase ratio higher than 50 %, and the rest phases 
are ZrN and t-ZrO2 with about the same ratio for each phase. The average stress of the two samples 
(S038 and S050) in this zone is almost the same, while the stress in t-ZrO2 is larger than that in ZrN. 
Unfortunately, due to the peak overlapping, the stress in Zr2ON2 cannot be measured by XRD 
method. However, the average stress is supposed to be mainly from the stress in Zr2ON2 phase. 
Compared with the stress in pure ZrN (sample S000), the stress in Zr2ON2 is about 60% lower than 
18
2. The properties of the films including electrical resistivity, mechanical and optical properties are 
substantially affected by the oxygen content in the film and the predominant phase in the three 
zones.
3. The residual stress in ZrN is relieved with increasing oxygen content. The high residual stress
in t-ZrO2 phase may be ascribed to the lattice distortion due to excess interstitial anions.    
Zr2ON2 and m-ZrO2 can be considered as low stress phases, and may relieve the residual stress 
of the films.
4. Experimental results imply that nitrogen interstitials in the c-axis octahedral sites may increase 
the stability of t-ZrO2 at room temperature. The increase of nitrogen content in ZrO2 phase 
results in the increase of refractive index and the decrease of band gap.

參加 2010國際冶金鍍膜與薄膜國際會議報告 
 
報告撰寫人：國立清華大學工程與系統科學系 黃嘉宏教授 
 
一、 參加會議經過： 
本年度之國際冶金鍍膜與薄膜國際會議於四月二十六日至四月三十日在美
國加州聖地牙哥市之 Town and Country Hotel 的會議中心舉行。本人與喻冀平教
授於四月二十四日由台灣搭馬來西亞航空班機於同日先到洛杉磯停留一夜後，
於四月二十五日租車前往聖地牙哥會議地點，並於四月二十六日下午一時三十
分口頭發表邀請論文。在四天主要的議程中，分八個主專題與四個先進專題同
時舉行。每天議程由早上八時開始，中午休息一個半小時，至下午五時結束。
由於議程平行進行，本人只能選擇與研究方向相近之議程參與，其他議程僅能
選擇性的參與。週四(四月二十九日)晚上五時至七時為海報論文發表時間，議程
結束後於當日先返回洛杉磯停留至五月一日，並搭乘五月二日凌晨零時三十分
馬航班機於三日清晨返抵國門。 
 
二、 參加會議心得與建議 
今年是本人第十二次參加 ICMCTF 會議。由於歐洲火山爆發與美國管制簽
證影響，今年各國與會人數較去年減少，約有六百人的規模，但台灣代表團約
有六十餘人，被會議接受發表之口頭與壁報文章將近百篇，以人數與論文數而
言，是除了美國之外參與人數第二的國家。歐洲國家參加的人數較往年減少，
但仍維持相當比例約佔所有與會人數的百分之三十，與會主力為歐洲幾個傳統
工業國家如：德國、瑞士、瑞典、法國、英國、與奧地利，美國仍為參加人數
最多的國家約佔百分之三十。亞洲國家參與人數今年也減少一些，除了台灣人
數最多之外，韓國與會人數較往年減少，日本參加人數亦不多，與台灣和韓國
不同之處在於，日本與會者大多來自工業界。中國大陸方面今年由大陸直接來
 4 
相反，經過預應變的試片，反而呈現塑性軟化現象。事實上，此結果並不相互
矛盾，其不同現象的原因在於起始的差排密度不同。由於微柱試片受尺寸的限
制，起始差排密度遠較巨觀試片小，因此預應變所增加之差排可以促進後續之
塑性變形，導致應變軟化現象。同時亦可利用不同形狀之壓痕頭，如圓錐狀或
角椎狀，藉以改變應力狀態，研究材料不同的機械性質表現。此外，結合奈米
硬度機與電子顯微鏡更有很大的進展，今年已有商用的奈米硬度機台附件放入
掃描式或穿透式電鏡中，此種設備使奈米壓印測試過程，可以直接使用電鏡觀
察，對微觀之塑性變形機制的了解，產生極大的助益。如同過去數年的發展，
奈米壓印測試亦結合了分子動力學模擬，此種實驗結合模擬的測試方式，可以
加速許多難以進行的實驗，藉由模擬亦可了解無法以實驗觀察的變形機制。國
內在硬體設備與模擬方面均落後國外甚多，應加速投資設備與培養模擬方面的
人才，否則一旦落後距離擴大，將來很難追趕。 
在本次會議中由於議程分成多線平行進行，因此不可能全部參與，本人主要
參與三方面:硬膜與功能奈米結構鍍膜之製程、薄膜機械性質與薄膜結構與性質
測量分析技術。  
在硬膜與功能奈米結構鍍膜製程方面，在去年的報告中本人提及，由於多靶
濺鍍與電弧離子鍍膜製程的進步與普及，多元薄膜材料在國際上的研究遽增，
近數年來幾乎已成為主流材料。今年的趨勢一如以往，與會者所發表的論文不
論是口頭發表或海報論文，其材料特色為成份多元，鍍膜多層或為奈米複合膜。
今年使用傳統陰極電弧離子覆膜法或磁控濺鍍法製作氧化物、氮化物、與氮化
物奈米複合膜仍佔多數。一般而言，工業界會較重視此類論文，因為工業量產
上的參考價值較高。不過由於材料成分與結構過於複雜，學理上的探討易日趨
困難，多元材料在學理方面的突破亦較少見。目前有許多的製程研究仍屬於改
變製程參數與製程方法，製作出硬度高或抗氧化性佳之保護鍍膜或是調整成分
改變鍍膜顏色。在新增議程方面有脈衝雷射蒸鍍法(PLD)的議程，此鍍膜法在學
 6 
力與結合理論計算與實驗，希望能縮短差距。 
在薄膜機械性質方面，今年主要重點仍在於奈米壓痕硬度與彈性係數量測方
法的精進。有許多研究利用微柱(micro-pillar)的壓痕法以量測脆性材料之塑性變
形機制，並探討隨著試片尺寸的縮小，材料塑性變形機制的改變。值得注意的
是硬體設備的進步相當迅速，現今先進的研究團隊都已將臨場(in situ)實驗數據
列入最可信的證據，如前所述在奈米壓印法方面，已有商用之機台可以將奈米
壓印測試設備置入掃描或穿透式電子顯微鏡中，再利用聚焦離子束製作試片，
進行微觀材料機械性質試驗，此種實驗經常得到與巨觀現象相反的結果，其原
因主要在於試片的尺寸效應。目前國內尚無此種硬體設備，希望國科會貴儀中
心能儘速充實此方面的設備，已利國內學者進行尖端之研究課題。 
如前所述，本次會議台灣的與會人數有六十多人，成員主要來自國內公私立
大學教授與研究生，業界參與人數仍居少數，只有一位在美國與大陸設廠的台
商。由於每年參與人數眾多，台灣已有學者進入籌備委員會，並擔任 session 
chair，並有多位學者獲得邀請演講者的榮譽。在提高國際能見度方面，本人認
為應繼續鼓勵國內產學界參與此會，以保有的來不易之地位。此外，雖有如此
眾多的參與人數，惟口頭發表論文的水準不夠，部分碩博士班的研究生英文口
語能力仍待加強，須知上台即代表國家，不可讓沒有充分準備的研究生上台發
表，以免有損國家形象。值得欣喜的是，相較於往年，今年台灣學生英文已有
進步。今年我所參與的議程中，台灣的碩博士生大多數能用達意的英文口頭發
表論文，但在回答問題方面，多數仍需再加強訓練。 
此次會議中論文所顯示的幾個鍍膜重要發展方向如下： 
(1) 理論計算模擬與實驗結合。此趨勢已漸成為國際研究團隊之主流，鍍膜與薄
膜製程如今已成為跨領域研究之重要主題之一，參與研究者之領域有材料科
學、物理、化學、化工、機械、電機等；亦有生物與醫學方面的人加入生醫
薄膜材料的研究。不論在鍍膜製程、機械性質、薄膜成長與材料科學，均有
 8 
供經費補助研究生出國開會，應該讓國際學界人士藉由開會的機會，了解我
國的科技能力，英語能力是不可或缺的工具，因此口頭發表論文的人選必須
慎選並有充分準備。 
 
三、 攜回資料

報告撰寫人：國立清華大學工程與系統科學系 黃嘉宏教授 
 
四、 參加會議經過： 
本年度之薄膜與表面鍍膜科技進展國際會議於七月十一日至七月十四日在
中國大陸哈爾濱市之哈爾濱工業大學舉行。本人與部分台灣鍍膜科技協會教授
組團前往哈爾濱與會。同行教授有清華大學杜正恭教授、明道大學郭正次、張
奇龍、連水養教授、東南科技大學黃仁清教授、明志科技大學李志偉教授、虎
尾科技大學蔡丕椿、謝淑惠、楊崇煒教授、雲林科技大學陳文照教授。我們於
七月十日由台灣搭海南航空班機到達大連市停留一夜後，於七月十一日轉機前
往哈爾濱會議地點，下午到達哈爾濱。本人所發表論文為本年度國科會計畫成
果於七月十二日以海報方式發表論文。本次會議在三天主要的議程中，分九個
主專題同時舉行。每天議程由早上八時三十分開始，中午休息一個小時，至下
午七時結束。由於議程平行進行，本人只能選擇與研究方向相近之議程參與，
其他議程僅能選擇性的參與。週三(七月十四日)並應邀到哈爾濱工業大學等離子
體表面技術與設備研究所演講並參訪，與所長田修波教授實驗室進行學術交
流，大會議程於週三結束後，在大陸東北旅遊三日後於七月十七日下午搭乘海
南航空班機由大連返回台北。 
五、 參加會議心得與建議 
今年是本人第一次參加 ThinFilms系列會議。此系列會議每兩年舉辦一次，
最早係由新加坡南洋理工大學張善勇(Sam Zhang)教授所發起舉辦，過去四屆會
議地點均在新加坡，今年首次在中國大陸舉行。各國與會人數相當多，主要係
來自中國大陸、台灣、香港、韓國、日本、澳洲、東南亞各國，歐美國家與會
者較少，與會者發表之論文總數有九百篇以上，台灣代表團包括各校師生超過
百人，被會議接受發表之口頭與壁報文章超過百篇，以人數與論文數而言，是
 12 
(Spinodal Decomposition)的現象，應用此原理，在適當的成分之下，可製作
出硬度高於 40 GPa之超硬薄膜。關於 TiSiN薄膜的研究，即為第二位 Keynote 
speaker Veprek 教授的研究主題。Veprek 教授是世界上第一位提出製作奈米
複合超硬薄膜的學者，同時亦在 2000年發表硬度為 105 GPa的超硬 TiSiN薄膜，
雖然到目前為止，仍未能有其他研究團隊再度複製其結果，但製作硬度超過 40 
GPa 之 TiSiN薄膜則以成為相當常見的結果，TiSiN亦已有工業上的應用，因此
Veprek教授在奈米超硬膜之貢獻為舉世所認定。本次演講題目為 Search for New 
Ultrahard Materials: Go Nano!其內容仍在引申其奈米複合物硬膜原理，並提
出第一原理理論計算，支持其過去的研究成果，並且提出超硬膜硬度下降之原
因主要在於氧的影響，同時說明 105 GPa 的硬度是可能達到的硬度。其演講中
最令人印象深刻的是理論計算部分，主要研究者為大陸旅德學者張瑞豐博士，
他由第一原理的計算，結合進一步的分子動力學可以計算出材料拉伸曲線，使
材料機械性質的研究前進一大步。 
在本次會議中本人主要參加的是Mechanical properties of thin films (MPF)議
程。此議程約有 100 篇論文，分為兩天的議程，因口頭發表的時間有限，約有
一半的文章在海報中發表，以下綜合整理其內容。  
在此議程中所包含的論文相當多樣，但論文主題最多者仍在於金屬氮化物、
氧化物與碳化物。如前所述，本次會議由於在中國大陸舉辦，因此可以藉由此
次會議的論文主題，觀察大陸在機械硬質鍍膜科技方面的發展。比較特別的是
中國大陸仍有相當多的學者從事金屬碳化物如 TaC、GeC、CrC 的研究。再者類
鑽碳膜(DLC)仍有相當多的論文。微電弧氧化(MAO)是大陸較特別的研究課題，
主要應用於鎂合金和鋁合金表面防蝕，尤其是工業上大面積防蝕之應用。當然
在 ICMCTF會議中主流的課題奈米複合膜 TiSiN,CrSiN與奈米多層膜亦有不少論
文。中國大陸學者另一特別的課題在於金屬鍍膜，如 CoCrAlY、RuNiAl、NiAl。
此類薄膜鍍著於超合金之上，用途在於防止高溫氧化。NiAl 原本就是鎳基超合
 14 
層膜結構應力分析，與奈米壓印之殘餘應力分析，雖然台灣方面亦有數篇論文
主題在此方面，但力量較分散整合度不足，仍需有更多人投入。尤其看到大會
兩位 Keynote Speaker 都使用第一原理加上分子動力學模擬，研究奈米結構薄
膜，而其中中國大陸旅外學者扮演重要角色，如果我們不急起直追，在計算材
料科學上著力，我們在鍍膜科技方面的優勢，將很快喪失。 
在週三(7/14)參訪哈爾濱工業大學等離子體表面技術與設備研究所並應邀發
表演講，演講題目為利用 X 光繞射法測量金屬氮化物薄膜應力。本次交流主要
是由該研究所所長田修波教授所促成。田教授是我在 2002年於香港城市大學材
料物理系訪問研究時所認識，他在城市大學畢業後返回哈爾濱工業大學任教，
目前是大陸在等離子體設備方面的頂尖專家之一。田教授的研究主力在高功率
電源供應器的製作，由於此種電源供應器由歐美進口相當昂貴，田教授已能將
此設備的成本壓低到十萬人民幣，大約是歐美設備五分之一的價錢，將來如能
量產相當有競爭力。國內此方面的研究，主要在核能研究所艾啟峰博士的電漿
組，我們目前的能力稍高於田教授的實驗室，但其成本則約為田教授實驗室的
1.5倍。本人除了參訪其實驗室外，並與參加此次國際會議的香港城市大學材料
物理系鍾志源與周志烽教授進行學術交流，在週三上午各發表三十至四十分鐘
的演講，主要聽眾為等離子所的研究生。由於學術領域相近，我們有相當深入
的討論，會後希望能有機會能在兩岸三地持續進行學術交流。  
如前所述，本次會議台灣的與會人數超過百人，成員主要來自國內公私立大
學教授與研究生。由於每次參與人數眾多，台灣已有學者進入籌備委員會，並
擔任 symposium chair，並有多位學者獲得邀請演講者的榮譽。在提高國際能見
度方面，本人認為應繼續鼓勵國內產學界參與此會，以保有的來不易之地位。
不過此次在大陸舉辦的會議仍有一些缺點，可以作為將來我們在台灣舉辦國際
會議之參考，首先在會場的選擇不是很恰當，交通方面的便利性不足；其次議
程方面的安排太過緊湊，尤其每天由早上 8:30一直到晚上 7:00中間僅有一小時
