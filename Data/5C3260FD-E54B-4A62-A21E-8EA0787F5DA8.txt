1. Abstract 
 
  The explicit, closed-form expressions of the Green’s functions for generally anisotropic elastic 
solids in three-dimensions that have been derived using Stroh’s formalism are employed in a 
formulation of the boundary element method (BEM).  Unlike several other existing schemes, the 
evaluation of these fundamental solutions does not require further numerical integration in the BEM 
algorithm; they have surprisingly not been implemented previously.  Three numerical examples 
are presented to demonstrate the veracity of the implementation and the general applicability of the 
BEM for the 3D elastic stress analysis of generally anisotropic solids. The results are compared 
with known solutions in the literature where possible, or those obtained by another numerical 
method, namely, the finite element method; in all cases, very good agreement is shown to be 
achieved. For treating thermoelasticity, consideration is given to the case of transversely isotropy. 
As is well known in the direction formulation of BEM, thermal effect will lead to an extra volume 
integral that will destroy the BEM’s notion of boundary discretization. To avoid domain 
discretization, this extra volume integral is analytically transformed into a series of boundary 
integrals and, thus, the BEM’s distinctive notation is fully recovered. 
 
 
Keywords:  Green’s function, anisotropic thermoelasticity, boundary element method. 
 
 
2. Introduction 
 
The determination of accurate stress distributions in structural details such as those near stress 
concentrations is very important in the design and safe-life assessment of many engineering 
components. To this end, the boundary element method (BEM) is well recognized as a very efficient 
numerical tool for the linear elastic stress analysis of isotropic solids. This is also true for treating 
problems of anisotropic solids in two-dimensions.  However, the advances that have been made of 
this method on its application to three-dimensional anisotropic elastic solids had been rather limited 
and quite sporadic. This is in spite of the increasing use of such materials in engineering over the 
past few decades. The main reason for the relatively slow pace of development is the mathematical 
complexity of the fundamental solutions to the governing equations in anisotropic elasticity in 
three-dimensions (3D). These fundamental solutions, or Green’s functions, are a necessary item in 
the formulation of the boundary integral equation (BIE). An efficient and accurate means of 
evaluating them is a key to the successful implementation of the BEM, as well as of other numerical 
techniques (such as the method of fundamental solutions and the meshless local BIE method).   
The fundamental solution of the displacement field due to a unit point load in a 3D generally 
anisotropic infinite solid in elastostatics has been derived by Lifschitz and Rozentsweig (1947).  It 
 4
noted by Tavara et al. (2008) as well, to the present authors’ knowledge, no BEM formulation 
employing them has hitherto been published in the literature.  
In this report, the explicit-form fundamental solutions for the displacements and its derivatives by 
Ting and Lee (1997) and Lee (2003) are used in the conventional BEM formulation for the general 
case of 3D elastic anisotropy.  The implementation has been successfully carried out by modifying 
a BEM code based on the quadratic isoparametric element formulation that has been previously 
developed for 3D isotropic elastostatics (Tan and Fenner, 1978, 1979; Tan, 1983). In the following 
sections, the fundamental solutions employed will first be reviewed.  Some aspects of the 
numerical implementation into the BEM code will also be discussed. This will then be followed by 
three examples, including test problems and those with stress concentrations.  
As is well known in the direct formulation of BEM, thermal loads manifest themselves as an 
additional volume integral.  Any numerical integration in a direct manner often faces difficulty in 
efficiently and correctly computing the volume integral when the temperature change inside the 
body is not uniform.  More seriously, the discretization of the whole domain into interior cells for 
the direct numerical integration will destroy the BEM’s distinctive notion of boundary 
discretization.  Over the years, several schemes have been proposed in the BEM analysis of 
isotropic, elastic bodies to avoid such domain discretization. They include Monte Carlo and domain 
fanning approach (see, e.g. Camp and Gipson (1992)), the Particular Integral approach (e.g. Deb 
and Barnerjee (1990)), Dual Reciprocity Method (e.g. Niku and Brebbia (1988)), and Exact 
Transformation Method (ETM) (e.g. Rizzo and Shippy (1997)). Among these approaches, the ETM 
that exactly transforms the volume integral into boundary ones is most appealing.  This is mainly 
due to its fundamental recovery of the BEM’s notion of boundary discretization, yet it does not 
resort to further numerical approximations per se like the other schemes.   
The ETM treatment for isotropic thermoelasticity has been commonly applied for both 2D and 
3D cases.  The success of such ETM treatment for anisotropic thermoelasticity was not achieved 
until Shiah and Tan (1999a) firstly applied a domain mapping technique to make the 
volume-to-surface integral transformation for the anisotropic thermoelasticity of two-dimensional 
cases only.  Moreover, Shiah and Tan (1999b) applied the ETM to derive the Somigliana’s identity 
for stress calculations at interior points of 2D anisotropic bodies.  However, the volume-to-surface 
integral transformation for 3D anisotropic thermoelasticity has not been accomplished, even not 
attempted yet, in the past decades. This is mainly due to the mathematical complexity of the 
fundamental solution for 3D anisotropic bodies, lacking of a truly closed-form expression.  Having 
laid down the groundwork of a challenging work- 3D anisotropic thermoelasticity, this paper 
focuses on making the volume-to-surface integral transformation for 3D transversely isotropic 
bodies, whose explicit closed-forms of the fundamental solution exist in open literature.   
The first fundamental solution for transversely isotropic materials can be credited to Lifshitz and 
Rozentsveig (1947) using the Fourier transform method.  Since then, a variety of different explicit 
forms for expressing the fundamental solution of 3D transversely isotropic bodies have been

The integrand Z-1 in eq. (2) is the inverse matrix of ijZ≡Z which can be expressed as (Ting and 
Lee, 1997)

where C≡ijksC  is the elastic stiffness tensor of the anisotropic material. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By introducing the following three tensors (Ting, 1996), 
ik ijks j s ik ijks j s ik ijks j sQ =C n n , R =C n m , T =C m m≡ ≡ ≡Q R T ,                   (6) 
eq. (5) can be rewritten into a simple form, 
( ) cos ( )pψ ψ2Z =  Γ ,                                (7) 
where p = tanψ , and the matrix ( )pΓ is given by 
          ( ) ( )T 2p = +p + +pΓ Q R R T .                           (8)          
By letting V= ( )T+R R , eq. (8) may be rewritten as 
( ) 2p = +p +pΓ Q V T .                               (9) 
A sextic equation in p is obtained by setting the determinant, | ( )pΓ |, to zero, the six independant 
roots of which are the Stroh’s eigenvalues. These roots must be complex for positive strain energy, 
and they appear as three pairs of complex conjugates. It can be proved (Hagedorn, 2000) that the 
sextic equation is not analytically tractable, however the computational effort to obtain the roots,

straightforward; the only numerical approach required in any of the steps is for the solution of the 
sextic equation for p. 
The numerical evaluation of the fundamental solution for tractions *ijT  is also required.  This may 
be carried out using 
* *( )ij ik k jT Nσ= ,                            (17) 
where *ikσ  is the fundamental solution for stresses at a field point due to a concentrated force 
applied in the xj direction at the source point, and kN  is the outward normal vector on the surface 
at the field point.  These stresses, denoted also by *jσ  here, can be determined using the 
generalized Hooke’s law, as follows,

In this paper, the analytically exact, explicit expression of the derivatives of Uij as obtained by Lee 
(2003), following the work in Ting and Lee (1997), is adopted. The first derivative of Uij can be 
written as follows (Lee, 2003; Shiah et al., 2008b):

As proved by Shiah and Tan (2004), Eq. (29) can be transformed to the standard Laplace equation by

It should be noted that the degenerate case when 11 33 13 442 0C C C C− − =  will lead to 1 2ν ν= .  
Theoretically speaking, this degenerate condition 1 2ν ν= will invalidate the computations of A1 and 
A2 if Eq. (39a) is to be used.  For testing the numerical stability of using Eq. (39a) instead of Eq. 
(39b) for the degenerate case, a few numerical experiments were performed to compute the 
fundamental solutions.  The results showed that the constants iA  were stably calculated using Eq. 
(39a) for the degenerate case owing to a small numerical perturbation introduced from calculating 
1 2,ν ν  by Eqs. (37a) and (37b).  Therefore, the degenerate case is no more treated separately on 
account of the fact that all equations for regular cases may yield accurate results.  Referring to the 
conditions in Eqs. (39a), one obtains 
+ 0i iA B = ,                               (40) 
As a result, the displacements of Eqs. (36a)-(36c) are simplified to

(1974) have been simplified to Eqs. (41a)-(41c) and (42a)-(42c), which are applicable to all cases 
including the degenerate one when 11 33 13 442 0C C C C− − =  occurs.  The first-order derivatives of 
displacements can thus be derived by simply making spatial differentiations of the displacements.  
Their explicit expressions are needed not only for computing the fundamental tractions but also for 
making volume-to-surface integral transformation that will be presented in the next section. 
 
6.  Exact volume-to-surface integral transformation 
Thermal load can be treated as an effective body force that leads to a volume integral 
expressed as 
, ( ) ,j i ij ik ijV VV B q U P q dV q U P q dVγ= = − Θ∫ ∫ ,k( ) ( ) ( ) ,              (48) 
where γik are the thermal moduli defined as 
ik ikmn mnCγ α= ,                                 (49) 
where mnα represent the thermal expansion coefficients.  For transversely isotropic materials, the 
thermal moduli are represented, for brevity, by 11 22 0 13 23 1 33 3 12 2, , ,γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ= = = = = = .  Recall 
that the heat conduction equation is now governed by the standard Laplace equation defined in the 
xˆ -coordinate system.  Using the chain rule to make partial differentiations, the temperature 
gradients are expressed as 
,1 ,1 1,1 ,2 2,1 ,3 3,1ˆ ˆ ˆx x xΘ = Θ + Θ + Θ ,                       (50a) 
,2 ,1 1,2 ,2 2,2 ,3 3,2ˆ ˆ ˆx x xΘ = Θ + Θ + Θ ,                     (50b) 
,3 ,1 1,3 ,2 2,3 ,3 3,3ˆ ˆ ˆx x xΘ = Θ + Θ + Θ .                     (50c) 
As a result of using the coordinate transformation, the above equations can be written in a matrix 
form,

.             (51) 
By using Eq. (51), the volume integral expressed in the mapped domain becomes 
ˆ

V U dV= − Γ Θ∫ ,k ,                           (52)

To integrate the above boundary integral using the Gauss quadrature scheme, one has to 
numerically compute the integrand at Gauss points.  As the usual process for treating 
thermoelasticity, the associated thermal data, including the temperature and its gradients, are 
determined by solving Eq. (34), defined for the mapped domain.  For numerical computation of 
the integrand in Eq. (36), the remaining task is to determine ijkW and ijk ,tW by Eq. (31).  Due to 
the mathematical complexity for expressing ij ,kU , derivation of the analytically explicit 
formulation of ijkW  cannot be readily achieved.  Instead of analytically deriving their explicit 
formulations, the fundamental solutions of ijkW and ijk ,tW at Gauss points can be numerically 
evaluated in the following manner that will be elaborated next. 
 
7.  Numerical determination of ijkW and ijk ,tW  
Consider a mapped domain with P and Q representing the source and field point, respectively.  
The goal is to determine the numerical values of ijkW and ,ijk tW at Q, an arbitrary Gauss point whose 
local spherical coordinate is (r, θ, φ).  It is noted that ,ijk tW  can be accurately computed by the 
finite difference scheme

therefore our focus is on using BEM to compute ijkW from Eq. (31), a standard Poisson’s equation.  
For solving this Poisson’s equation, a spherical domain with the source point P at the origin is 
designed to have the radius R such that the radial distance of all Gauss points r is always smaller 
than R.  In other words, these Gauss points are treated as internal points of this auxiliary spherical 
domain.  The boundary integral equation for solving this Poisson’s equation is given by

8.  Numerical implementation 
 
Three numerical examples are presented here to demonstrate the veracity of the formulations 
implemented and the application of the BEM to three-dimensional stress analysis in anisotropic 
elasticity. As an initial check of the BEM models employed for these problems, the established 
BEM code for isotropy was first used to solve each of them using isotropic material properties. The 
analysis was repeated using the implemented anisotropic algorithm; identical numerical results were 
obtained in all cases. The first example considered, Problem A, is a rectangular prism of alumina 
crystal (Al2O3) subjected to pure shear for which an exact analytical solution of the displacements 
has been derived by Lekhnitskii (1963). In Problem B, the stress distributions around a spherical 
cavity and in a hollow sphere subjected to remote hydrostatic stress are determined.  The problem 
of a cylindrical bar with a spherical cavity and under remote tension is then analyzed in the last 
example, Problem C. Using Eshelby’s equivalent inclusion method, Chiang (2007) has investigated 
the stress concentrations around a spherical cavity in an infinite cubic medium under different 
uniform loading conditions; his solutions are used for comparison with some the present BEM 
results in Problems B and C using the properties of niobium (Nb) crystal which is cubic. In the 
analysis of these problems, the principal material axes of the crystals are taken be coincide with the 
global Cartesian axes, unless indicated otherwise. In Problem C, additional analyses involving 
rotations of the principal material axes were further carried out as will be explained later. These 
were done solely for the purpose of further demonstrating the suitability of the present BEM 
program to treat fully general anisotropic materials. The elastic constants (stiffness coefficients) for 
the Nb and Al2O3 crystals are taken to be as follows (Huntington, 1958): 
 
For Nb crystal,    C11= 246 GPa; C12= 134 GPa; C44= 28.7 GPa. 
 
For Al2O3 crystal,  C11= 465 GPa; C33= 563 GPa; C44= 233 GPa; C12= 124 GPa;  
C13= 117 GPa; C14= 101 GPa. 
 
Problem A 
 
Figure 2 shows a rectangular alumina crystal parallelepiped which is subjected to a unit uniform 
shear stress τ23 = τo= 1 on four of its sides.  The BEM mesh employed is shown in Fig.3; it has 10 
quadrilateral elements and 32 nodes. Proper nodal constrains are prescribed to preclude rigid body 
motion in the analysis.  The displacements, ui, obtained from the present BEM analysis at the five 
points A – E indicated in Fig. 2 are listed in Table 1. The numerical values are compared with those 
calculated using Lenitskii’s (1963) exact analytical solution, where it can be seen that there is 
excellent agreement between the two sets of results.

Problem B 
  
In the second example, the stress distributions at the inner and outer surfaces of a thick-walled 
sphere subjected to uniform hydrostatic tensile stress, σo, at the outer surface are determined for a 
cubic material.  Referring to Fig. 4, the radius ratios considered were K = R2/R1= 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 
20. The same basic mesh design shown in Fig. 5 and the material properties of niobium crystal were 
used in the BEM analysis; the BEM mesh contains a total of 64 elements and 156 nodes, the 
exterior surface being modeled with just 16 triangular elements with 34 nodes. It should be 
remarked that advantage can be taken of the symmetry of the material properties for the cubic 
medium and the loading conditions, and only a fraction of the physical problem needs to be 
modeled. However, the whole sphere was modeled to establish the suitability of the mesh design 
which can then be employed for more general anisotropic properties in future studies. Table 2 lists 
the computed normalized stresses, kθ = σθ/σo and kz =σφ/σo, at the four nodal points along the inner 
surface of the sphere in the plane of the “horizontal” equator (i.e. in the x1- x2).  Also shown in the 
table are the corresponding analytical solution and BEM results using the same mesh for the case of 
isotropy; it is evident that the anisotropic material properties has a significant influence on the stress 
distributions in the sphere. Unlike in isotropy, the direct stresses σθ and σφ are no longer of the same 
magnitude in the sphere of Nb crystal under the hydrostatic stress loading. A comparison of the 
BEM results for the case of R2/R1= 20 with Chiang’s (2007) analytical solution can be made; the 
errors introduced by the finite external radius in the BEM analysis for this case are not expected to 
be significant. The deviations between the two sets of results at the nodal points are all within 1.0% 
for kz and 1.5% for kθ, demonstrating the veracity and accuracy of the present formulation.

Problem C 
 
The third example considered is a cylindrical bar with a spherical cavity under remote tension, σo, 
as shown in Figure 6.  The range of cavity sizes considered was a/R = 0.1 to 0.5, where a and R 
are the radii of the cavity and the cylindrical bar, respectively; also, the half-length of the bar H = 
2R. A typical BEM mesh used is shown in Figure 7; the same basic mesh configuration was used in 
all cases of a/R. The problem was first solved for a cubic medium where a check of the results for 
the case of a/R = 0.1 can be made with the solution by Chiang (2007) for an infinite body using the 
properties of Nb crystal. Table 3 shows the computed BEM results of the normalized stresses, kz= 
σ33/σo and kθ = σθ/σo, around the horizontal equator for a niobium crystal cylindrical bar with the 
spherical cavity. A comparison of the BEM anisotropic results and Chiang’s (2007) solution is also 
shown. Again, excellent agreement was obtained between the two sets of results; the deviations for 
kz were all within 1.0% while those for the significantly smaller magnitudes of kθ were less than 
3.0%.

cavity. Figure 8 shows the variation of the stress concentration factor, kz = σ33/σo, for the various a/R 
ratios considered.  Also shown for comparison are the results obtained using ANSYS FEM 
analysis, where it can be see that there is excellent agreement between them; a typical FEM mesh 
employed is shown in Fig. 9. For isotropy, the stress concentration factors are dependent on the 
Poisson’s ratio; the results for the case of Poisson’s ratio of 0.3 are plotted in Fig. 8 as well. 
Interestingly, the deviations of corresponding values of kz between the anisotropic and isotropic 
cases are relatively small. In addition, the magnitudes of σθ/σo are typically two orders of magnitude 
smaller than kz, and hence are not presented here. This is not too surprising in view of the near 
quasi-isotropy in the x1- x2 plane.  
As a demonstration of the applicability of the BEM program to treat full general anisotropy, the 
principal material axes in the x1-, x2- and x3-directions of the alumina are rotated clockwise by 30o, 
45o and 60o, respectively.  These rotations are arbitrarily chosen; they result in a fully populated 
stiffness matrix in the Cartesian coordinate system for the physical problem as follows:

The BEM analysis was repeated for all the cases of a/R treated above, and the ANSYS FEM 
analysis was also carried out for comparison of the results.  It was found that even with the 
rotation of the three principal material axes, the stress concentration factor kz does not vary 
significantly around the horizontal equator of the spherical cavity, with the deviations of the nodal 
values from one another being less than 2.5% for all the geometries analyzed. Thus it may, for all 
intents and purposes, be considered to be also uniform. The variation of kz with a/R is also shown in 
Fig. 8. What is clearly evident is the elevation of its magnitude with the change in orientations of 
the material axes. The BEM and FEM results again show very good agreement indeed.

9. Conclusions 
 
A BEM formulation based on closed-form algebraic expressions of the fundamental solutions for 
the elastostatic three-dimensional stress analysis of solids with general anisotropy has been 
presented in this paper. These Green’s functions have been derived by Ting and Lee (1997) and Lee 
(2003) and are expressed in terms of Stroh’s eigenvalues; they have never been previously 
employed in BEM formulations for general anisotropy. Their explicit algebraic forms allow 
relatively simple implementation into an existing BEM code which had been developed for 3D 
isotropic elasticity.  Three example problems have been presented to illustrate the veracity of the 
numerical implementation.  They include those with stress concentrations for which the BEM is 
well known to be very well suited to treat. Where possible, the numerical results obtained from the 
BEM analysis have been compared with known solutions in the literature or with those obtained by 
the finite element method, and very good agreement between them have been obtained.

the previous explicit formulation given in terms of high-order tensors. Numerical results computed by both 
algorithms for two examples will be presented. First, a review of the fundamental solutions is in order. 
Fundamental solutions of 3D anisotropic elastic bodies 
The availability of an efficient scheme to evaluate the Green’s functions is important for the 
development of the BEM as a robust and successful computational tool for the stress analysis of 3D 
anisotropic elastic solids. To this end, it is highly desirable that these fundamental solutions are not just 
concise and fully explicit in form for ease of implementation, but that they are also efficient to evaluate. 
The Green’s function for displacements in 3D anisotropic bodies derived by Ting and Lee [2] as 
implemented by Tan et al. [1] can be expressed in simple closed-form as

where r is the radial distance between the load and field point, and [ ]H x , the Barnett-Lothe tensor, is

The expressions for T , ( )ˆ nΓ  and  nq  in eq. (2) may be found in [1], [2].  It has been demonstrated [1], [10], 
that the numerical evaluation of this Green’s function is relatively straightforward; no issue concerning the 
computational efficiency with its use would arise. This displacement fundamental solution has to de 
differentiated to obtain the traction fundamental solution which is another required item in the direct 
formulation of the boundary integral equation.  The two different approaches to obtain the derivatives of 
this Green’s function by Lee [3][4] and resulting explicit forms will now be briefly outlined below.  
In the earlier work by Lee [3], the differentiation of the above Green’s function is carried out 
directly, in the Cartesian coordinate system. The derivatives obtained this way can be expressed as

In eq. (3), pqrsC are the stiffness coefficients of an anisotropic body; yi is defined by 
1 sin cosy φ θ= , 2 sin siny φ θ= , 3 cosy φ= ,                          (4) 
where yi are the components of a unit position vector y = x/r in a spherical coordinate system, and  θ, φ are 
the spherical angles defined in the usual manner. Also ijklmnM  is defined by

where pt are the roots of the Stroh’s eigenvalues with the subscript t following the cyclic rule t=(t-3) if t>3.  
The reader is referred to [1] or [3] for the full algebraic expression of ijklmnΦ . It is evident that the 
computation of the terms in eq.(3) and eq.(5), although direct and simple in principle, involves numerous 
arithmetic operations due to the presence of the high-order tensors. It should also be noted that this 
formulation is not valid when there are repeated roots. This is, however, not a serious problem in the 
numerical implementation as it may be resolved quite simply by introducing a small perturbation to the 
repeated roots. In the course of verifying the implementation of this formulation into a BEM code [1], it 
was found that when treating the degenerate case of transversely isotropic bodies, serious truncation errors 
may occur in computing these derivatives in some instances.  The errors may also be easily rectified by 
using double precision arithmetic. As all these computations are carried out using complex variables, 
Stroh’s eigenvalues being complex numbers, the use of double precision arithmetic together with the 
operations of complex variables, can involve a significant increase in the computational effort especially 
when compared to the corresponding problem in isotropic elasticity.  
By differentiating with respect to the spherical coordinates as an intermediate step, separating the 
terms associated with the radial distance, and then applying the chain rule for the total derivative, Lee [4]

The above formulation is valid for the general case with distinct Stroh’s eigenvalues. The procedure can be 
applied to the case of repeated roots and the corresponding simpler expressions may be obtained; for these, 
the reader is referred to [4]. It is apparent that the previous formulation for computing the first order 
derivatives of displacements, given by eq.(3), is more concise in form and easier to program into a 
computer code than the latter, given by eq.(6).  However, this newer formulation avoids the need to high-
order tensors. In addition, the computations of ( , )nA θ φ , ( , )nB θ φ and all the terms in eq.(9) involve only 
real variables. Furthermore, eq.(13) needs to be computed only for its imaginary part since numerical values 
of the integrals must be real. All these should help improve the computational effort in obtaining the 
derivatives of the displacement Green’s function. 
Numerical examples 
 
The second example examines the relative computational efficiency of the present formulation as 
compared to that of [3] which has been implemented in [1]. Both of these formulations for the displacement 
derivatives have been implemented into an existing BEM program code which was originally developed for 
3D elastostatics analysis of isotropic bodies. This program adopts the quadratic isoparametric elements, and 
4x4 Gauss integration is employed for the quadrilateral element. Figure 1(a) shows the problem considered; 
it is a long rectangular alumina crystal parallelepiped with one end fully constrained in all directions and the 
other end subjected to a unit uniform tensile stress σo= 1 unit. The elastic stiffness coefficients of the 
alumina are as follows:

A typical BEM mesh used is shown in Fig. 1(b), and the Von Mises equivalent stress, σeq, along centreline 
AB at the top surface is determined. As further verification of the present formulation, this problem was 
also analyzed using the FEM commercial code ANSYS. A total of 1296 SOLID186 quadratic elements with 
a total of 6685 nodes were used in the FEM analysis, while the BEM analysis employed 40 quadrilateral 
elements with 122 nodes.  Figure 2 shows the computed Von Mises stress by the two different numerical 
methods, where it can be seen that there is very good agreement between these results. To compare the 
relative efficiency of using the two formulations for the displacement derivatives by Lee [3] and Lee[4], 
respectively, the number of boundary elements used was varied from 24 to 104 elements. The total CPU 
time taken for each analysis using a personal computer (PC) is nomalised with respect to the corresponding 
total CPU time for the isotropic case using the same mesh.  The results are shown plotted in Fig. 3. Clearly, 
the newer formulation for the displacement derivatives of the Green’s function for obtaining the traction 
fundamental solution in the BEM algorithm produced a significantly better performance in the overall 
computer run times than when the previous formulation in [3] was used. The improvement in the overall 
CPU time was by at least a factor of two. The results shown in Figure 3 should also be viewed with the 
proper perspective, for it should be remarked that even with a less than most up-to-date PC, the real time to 
carry out a computer run with the smaller mesh designs was typically in the order of several seconds.

二、與會心得 
 The Boundary Element Method (BEM) also known as the Boundary Integral Equation Method 
(BIEM) has in recent years become an established method of solution in several important areas of 
engineering such as fracture mechanics, acoustics and solid dynamics among others. However, there 
are still many areas where the method needs to be developed further. In this conference there were
many participants presenting innovative ideas for a wide range of applications and advances made 
on the numerical implementation of the method. The applications of the method to practical 
problems reported in this conference were very extensive. The conference series have the support of 
the leading experts in the field of Boundary Element Methods and has rapidly become a leading 
computational mechanics forum for presentation of latest research in the field. 
The conference is an interesting one that inspired me a great deal in terms of new approaches 
and applications in engineering problems, such like contact stress, shape optimization, drilling 
rotations, and some 3D BEM implementations. Having discussed with some participants, I was 
inspired to implement new approaches for 3D BEM elastostatics. Totally broadened by the 
conference, I now realize the boundary element technique may deal with many engineering 
problems that I have not considered before. Through discussions with participants, I got to know the 
pros and cons of my recently developed algorithm to compute the 3D Green’s functions.  One of 
the most valuable gains is to get acknowledged by international renowned researchers for my new 
approach to compute the displacement derivatives, especially the second-order derivatives of the 3D 
Green’s displacements in anisotropic bodies.  This approach has laid the foundation for carrying 
out my NSC project proposed for the next few years.  Also, I got to meet my former advisor for 
my PostDoc research in Canada, Professor Tan. We had a few idea exchanges for implementing my 
current approach in the problem of 3D fracture of anisotropic bodies.  He suggested using the 
displacement formula of COD (crack opening displacement) to compute the SIFs before we proceed 
to submit a paper to an international journal.  This can be used as a check of the results for those 
computed by the traction formulas.  Also, we also meet Dr. Sladek again, whom I had met in the 
last Beteq conference held in Italy and Spain. He has been actively participating at the BEM 
technique.  Through the discussion with him, I acquired an important piece of information that the 
BEM analysis for 3D anisotropic thermoelasticity had been a challenge in this field.  This is 
because the fundamental solution does not have an analytical form that may be used to make 
volume-to-surface integral transformation. When thermal effect is involved, the boundary integral
shall have a domain integral term that requires domain discretisation in the conventional BEM 
analysis.  By applying Green’s divergence Theorem, we may transform the volume integral into a 
series of boundary ones, provided the fundamental solution is of an analytical form. Unfortunately, 
this fundamental solution exists in a numerical format.  So far, I have implemented the analytical 
formulations of the 3D anisotropic Green’s functions into my 3D BEM code. I am on the final stage 
of implementing the volume to surface integral technique to treat the 3D anisotropic 
thermoelasticity. To carry out such transformation, I plan to compute the fundamental solution by 
solving the Poisson’s equation.
