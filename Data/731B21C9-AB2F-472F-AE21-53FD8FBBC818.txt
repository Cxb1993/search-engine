Abstract. This project studies the application 
of the stable fuzzy optimal control strategies 
for reducing the dynamic responses of the 
bridges with sliding bearing isolation hybrid 
protective system. Hence it is necessary to 
develop non-linear control methods. The 
control method is a combination of the sliding 
mode control (SMC) and the Fuzzy control. 
The performance and robustness of the 
proposed control methods are all 
demonstrated by numerical simulation. 
Simulation results demonstrate that the 
presented methods are viable and an attractive 
control strategy for application to seismically 
excited bridges with sliding bearing isolation.  
Keywords: Fuzzy Control, Isolation 
1  Introduction 
For protecting the safety and integrity of the 
structures, the theory of structural control was 
proposed. The hybrid control methods, 
possessing the advantages of both passive and 
active control systems, have received 
considerable attention recently [1]. Hybrid 
protective systems, consisting of a 
combination of passive base-isolation system 
and active control devices, as shown in Figure 
1, have been shown to be quite effective in 
reducing the structural responses when 
subjected to strong earthquakes.  
The disadvantage of the isolators is large 
lateral displacement may induce damages[2]. 
The idea of hybrid control is to utilize the 
advantages of both active and passive control 
systems. The sliding bearing isolation system 
is used to reduce the ground motion 
transmitted to the bridge, whereas the active 
control devices are used to reduce the 
response of bridge. Since the dynamic 
behavior of sliding bearing isolation systems 
is either highly nonlinear or inelastic, it is 
necessary to found a nonlinear control method 
for such nonlinear systems. The concept of 
structural control in civil engineering 
applications was originated in the early 
system controlled by actuators and subjected 
to ground excitation gx&&  can be written as

respectively, for the superstructure; l= r-vector 
denoting the influence of the earthquake 
excitation; mb , cb , and kb are base mass,

U(t) corresponds to the actuator forces 
(generated via active tendon system or an 
active mass damper, for example), f(t) is the 
forces from the isolators; this is only a static 
model, neglecting the dynamic equations of 
actuators.. The frictional force of the sliding 
bearings is given by 
f(t)= µ mgv(t)                       (3) 
in which mg = the weight of the structural 
system above the sliding bearing; and µ is the 
coefficient of friction. Generally, the 
coefficient of friction µ  is velocity-dependent. 
A approximate model for the frictional 
coefficient µ of sliding bearings using 
Teflon/strainless steel plates is obtained 
experimentally[24, 25]:  
µ =µm-µf bxae &µ−                        (4) 
in which µm, µf and µa are constants to be 
obtained experimentally using curve-fitting 
procedures; and xb is the relative displacement 
of the sliding system. The constants µm, µf  
and µa depend on the surface condition and 
the pressure of sliding bearings.

3 Sable Fuzzy Optimal control  
For a complete account of robust control such 
as sliding mode control theory, the reader can 
consult the references[16, 17]. The design of a 
sliding mode controller consists of two steps: 
(1) The design of the sliding surface (2) The 
design of the control strategy to steer the state 
trajectory to the sliding surface. 
The design of the sliding surface is 
described in the following. Consider the 
equation of system have the form 
X& =AX+BU+BH+F+W               (8) 
where X(t) is a n state vector, n=2(r+1), A is a 
n×n system matrix, B is a n×m matrix, H is a 
n vector which contains the uncertainty and

Assume uf  exists a specific fuˆ  which 
achieves minimum control cost. fuˆ  satisfies 
the sliding mode condition.  
From (16), fuˆ  can be written as follows: 
fuˆ = Tvˆ Ψ                           (17) 
where vˆ is the optimal vector which achieves 
the minimum control cost. 
Define the parameter vector as  
v~ = v- vˆ                            (18) 
Let the Lyapunov function for each controller 
as  
V= )~~1(
2
1 2 vvs Tα+                     (19) 
where α is a positive constant. 
Finally, the adaptive law is obtained as 
Ψ−= isPbv α&                         (20) 
The adaptive law adjusts the centers of the 
membership function. From above can see 
that the traditional fuzzy sliding mode 
controller requires the upper bound of 
uncertainty. While the uncertainty increases, 
the control cost increases as well. But the 
optimal value of uncertainty can not be 
obtained exactly owing to the unknown of 
structure or system complexity. Stable fuzzy 
optimal control proposed in this paper can 
deal with the problem and estimate the 
minimum control cost.  
Next section some examples are used to 
illustrate the stable fuzzy optimal control in 
sliding bearing isolated bridges. 
4  Numerical Simulation and Results 
The stable fuzzy optimal controller is used to 
control bridge with sliding bearing isolator. 
Fig. 1 shows an isolated two-span continous 
deck bridge. The nominal value of bridge deck 
mass is 770 ton, pier mass is 128 ton, stiffness 
of pier is 3.1e5 KN/m, damping ratio is 0.02. 
The coefficient of friction µ for Teflon 
/strainless steel bearings is given by (3) with 
mµ =0.1, fµ =0.05, µa =20 s/m. The parameter 
values for (4) are α =1.0, β =0.5, η =2, 
γ =0.5, and Dy=1.2×10-4m. Firstly, the El 
Centro earthquake scaled to a peak ground 
acceleration of 0.3g is used as input excitation. 
The optimal sliding mode method is used to 
determine the sliding surface with a diagonal 
weighting matrix Q; Q11 =1000, Q22 = 10, and 
Q33 = Q44 = 1. The sliding surface of bridge 
with sliding bearing isolation device can be 
obtained as –1.63x1+3.26x2+6.31e-3 1x& + 2x& = 0. 
x1 is pier displacement relative to the ground, 
x2 is deck displacement relative to the pier. 
There are 49 fuzzy rules in this fuzzy 
controller. They are shown in Table 1.  For 
each fuzzy number, the triangular membership 
function is used.  
To examine the robustness of the stable 
fuzzy optimal control, we vary the stiffness of 
all the unit of the bridge by ± 40% and 
suppose 60 ms time delay. All maximum 
response quantities of bridge with sliding 
bearing isolation are shown in Table 2. xd= x1, 
xp= x2, dx&& = 1x&&  , Fp,  Umax, and σU are deck
