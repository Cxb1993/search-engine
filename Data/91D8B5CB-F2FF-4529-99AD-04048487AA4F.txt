During CdSe nanocrystal growth, loss of surface capping molecules occurs leading to a decrease of
photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield. In general, aliphatic capping molecules are applied to
passivate the surface of CdSe nanocrystals to modulate the optical properties of the CdSe. In this work,
two kinds of alkylamine (n-butylamine (n-BA) and n-hexylamine (n-HA)) and oleic acid (OA) were used
to modify the surfaces of the CdSe nanocrystals. From the PL spectra and quantum yield analyses, we
observed that the PL emission peak positions of the modified CdSe nanocrystals have blue shifted for
all three capping molecules. However, the PL quantum yield of the CdSe nanocrystals increased after
introduction of the alkylamine molecules, but decreased with oleic acid. The detailed mechanism was
not clear until now. In this study, a density function theory (DFT) simulation was employed to
demonstrate binding energy and charge analyses of CdSe with n-BA, n-HA and OA. By comparing the
binding energy of the bare CdSe nanocrystals to that of the CdSe with the capping molecules, it was
shown that n-BA and n-HA as capping molecules help to increase the charge on Se and decrease it on
cadmium of the CdSe.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great interest over
the past years because their properties are remarkably different
from bulk semiconductors and can be tailored by controlling
their composition, size and surface.1 These characteristics arise
from several phenomena (viz. quantum confinement of charge
carriers, surface effects, and geometrical confinement of
phonons) and have turned semiconductor nanocrystals into
promising materials for many applications, such as light-emitting
diodes,2–4 lasers,5,6 photonic band gap crystals,7 ultrafast
photonic switches, and biomedical tags for biological imaging,
and nanosensors.8,9
It has been established that the mechanism responsible for the
photoluminescence (PL) of nano materials is electron-hole
recombination, an event that takes place in the interior of the
crystallites. Therefore, proper electronic passivation of the
nanocrystal surface serves to reduce the number of surface
defects, which are thought to be responsible for non-radiative
recombination, to achieve a high quantum yield. While the
surfaces capped by various organic or inorganic molecules
appear to influence only moderately the absorption characteris-
tics, it is well know that the emission efficiency and time evolu-
tion are very strongly affected by the surface treatment. Control
of the surfaces is in particular the key to highly luminescent
nanocrystals. Recently, several groups studied inorganic passiv-
ation of CdSe nanocrystals with higher band gap materials, such
as CdSe/ZnS,10,11 CdSe/ZnSe,12,13 CdSe/CdS,14,15 etc. Generally,
choosing the relative band gap positions leads to enhanced
charge transfer or improved luminescence. However, syntheses
of core/shell nanocrystals go through additional coating proce-
dures using highly active precursors, which have to be chosen
very selectively for appropriate passivation and quantum
confinement effects. Also, ideally epitaxial encasing would not be
easily achieved and the bonding characteristics introduce addi-
tional difficulties to maintain size control or prevent alloying.16
In a previous report, capping molecule-protected CdSe
nanocrystals consisting of semiconductor cores surrounded by
organic monolayer have attracted considerable interest for
applications in materials science and nanotechnology.17–19
Majeitch et al. showed increased PL of CdSe nanocrystals
capped with butanethiolate.20 Talapin et al. reported blue shifts
in the UV/visible absorption and PL spectra of the CdSe nano-
crystals upon exchange of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) with
amines, such as n-hexadecylamine, n-dodecylamine or allyl-
amine, producing roughly an order of magnitude increase in PL
quantum yield.10 Although these studies enabled syntheses of
stable capping molecule-protected semiconductor nanocrystals
with various sizes, shapes, and compositions, very few studies
have been conducted on the surface structures and properties of
capping molecules. Not much is known regarding the nature and
chemical properties of the binding between nanocrystals and
their ligands. In selecting the capping molecules for the nano-
crystals, a general practice is to extend the knowledge from
traditional solution-coordination chemistry and surface chem-
istry on bulk materials. It must, however, be noted that
compared to atoms on the flat surface of bulk substrates, the
binding abilities of the atoms on the curved surfaces may be
affected by their diverse structural environments and size-
dependent electron configuration.
Despite the importance of surface exchange reactions with
organic capping molecules for functionalization of semi-
conductor nanocrystals, information on the influence of the

The high resolution TEM image in Fig. 1(b) also shows the
crystallinity of CdSe nanocrystals. The corresponding fast
Fourier transfer (FFT) diffraction pattern of Fig. 1(b), shown in
Fig. 1(c), indicates the crystal structure of CdSe nanocrystals as
zinc blend.
The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of these CdSe
nanocrystals varying with growth time are shown in Fig. 2(a),
(b). The luminescence spectra from these CdSe nanocrystals are
symmetric and narrow. However, the PL quantum yields
decreased with growth time and were down to 5%, as shown in
Fig. 2(c). It has been reported by Qu and Peng that the PL
quantum yield of CdSe nanocrystals is not very sensitive to the
imperfection of crystallinity of nanocrystals caused by the
stacking faults, but it is still sensitive to the surface environment
of nanocrystals, for instance, organic ligands or inorganic
passivation on the surface of CdSe nanocrystals have improved
the PL quantum yield dramatically.37 Talapin et al. also reported
that a decrease of the PL efficiency of size-selected fractions in
comparison with the initial crude solutions when the ligand
molecule is more labile and can be washed out easily.38 In this
study, only oleic acid and TBP were used to passivate the surfaces
of CdSe nanocrystals and the surface coverage decreased with
increasing growth time due to increasing size of CdSe nano-
crystals. Our results also showed that the PL quantum yield is
very sensitive to the surface environment of the CdSe nano-
crystals. On the basis of the above observations, it is reasonable
to rationalize that the control of the surface, probably a recon-
structed surface of CdSe nanocrystals, may be very important for
controlling and improving their PL properties.
To understand the changes in the optical properties of the
CdSe nanocrystals upon modification by the capping molecules,
n-BA, n-HA or OA, were added to a solution of as-grown CdSe,
and the PL and the UV/vis spectra were recorded before and
after the addition. The PL spectra and the quantum yields of the
CdSe nanocrystals modified by n-BA, n-HA or OA are shown in
Fig. 3. We can observe that the positions of the luminescence
emission peaks of the ligand-modified CdSe nanocrystals shifted
to lower wave lengths for all the three capping molecules
compared to the as-grown CdSe nanocrystals, Fig. 3(a). A
similar blue-shift in emission following amine addition has also
been observed in some other studies.10,39 Moreover, Fig. 3(b)
shows that the PL quantum yield increased to 45% and 61% for
the amines n-BA and n-HA, respectively, while OA showed
a decrease to 5%. Generally, it is believed that the capping
molecules effectively passivate the surface states and suppress the
non-radiative recombination at surface vacancies, leading to
enhanced PL quantum yield. But, contrary to this, of the three
capping agents in our work, OA ligand exhibited an opposite
behavior. Besides, some researchers reported that the quenching
emission of the CdSe nanocrystals was observed at a relatively
high concentration of capping molecules around 40 mM.40–42
But, we observed the variations in the PL quantum yield of the
ligand-modified CdSe nanocrystals with relatively lower
concentration of all the aliphatic organic compounds at 5 mM
(Fig. 3(b)). These observations clearly indicate that the passiv-
ation effect of the capping molecules for CdSe nanocrystals are
indeed more complex, suggesting a careful examination of the
photoinduced charge transfer between CdSe nanocrystals and
capping molecules. The present work was undertaken to unravel
some of these aspects.

molecule’s capping effect (with lower Eb values). Additionally,
the OA molecule with linear carbon-carbon structure can easily
form a dense and stable cover layer on the surface of CdSe,
preventing other molecules from approaching the CdSe QDs.44
Moreover, the structure of the OA molecule has large stereo-
hindrance. All these factors severely reduce effective bonding
between the OA molecule and CdSe. Thus, the present study
clearly demonstrates that the improved charge transfer of amine-
capped CdSe mainly arises due to higher value of Bader charge,
implying a larger charge donation than OA, and the modification
of CdSe QD by molecular capping plays an important role for
improvement of CdSe charge donation.
Fig. 5 illustrates the PL intensity dependence on charge
donation between CdSe and ligands. At present, we are inter-
ested in a preliminary estimation of how atomic charges may
change with the HA ligand.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that amines can be used as
the capping molecules for CdSe nanocrystals to largely enhance
PL quantum yield based on the DFT computation. We propose
that the interactions between capping molecules and CdSe
nanocrystals may be attributed to the NH2 group and CdSe
cluster. A better understanding of this interaction will facilitate
the design of better conjugates for CdSe nanocrystals for various
applications.
