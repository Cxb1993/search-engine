 2 
detectabilities. By combining probability 
calculations based on the use of the POD 
functions together with Monte Carlo 
simulations of the crack growth for the 
fracture-critical member, a total cost 
function is formulated that includes the 
cost of inspections and failure that result 
with each alternative NDI technique and 
inspection schedule. The selection of an 
NDI technique with an associated 
inspection schedule is modeled as an 
optimization problem. The POD 
function corresponding to the NDI 
technique and the inspection interval are 
optimization variables for this problem. 
With appropriate constraints on 
inspection intervals and on a minimum 
(target) safety level, an optimal 
combination of NDI technique and 
inspection schedule that yields the 
minimum total cost and ensures the 
prescribed acceptable safety level for the 
specified detail can be obtained. 
 
PROBABILITY OF DETECTION 
The four possible outcomes of any 
NDI procedure are: true positive (hit), 
false negative (miss), false positive 
(false call) and true negative (correct 
accept). The probability of detection 
(POD) of a crack of a given size is the 
conditional probability of a true positive 
call given that a crack with that size 
exists. Hence, from repeated inspections, 
an estimate of the POD can be obtained 
as follows: 
FNTP
TPˆ
NN
N
DOP
+
=  (1) 
where P Ô D = POD estimate for a 
specific crack size; NTP = number of true 
positive calls; NFN = number of false 
negative calls. After introducing cracks 
of various sizes into test specimens and 
performing inspections, POD estimates 
for various crack sizes from different 
NDI techniques can be obtained. 
Generally, two analysis approaches – the 
Hit/Miss method (Berens and Hovey, 
1981) and the Signal Response method 
(Berens, 1989)– are employed to 
formulate the POD function, POD(a), 
for any crack size, a, with any NDI 
technique. 
 
FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH 
MODEL 
 The basic fatigue crack growth 
relation can be derived from the Paris’ 
Law (1963) and Linear Elastic Fracture 
Mechanics (LEFM) as follows: 
   
( )[ ]
m
RE
a
a m
SNC
aaF
daN ××=ò
0
  
p
 (2) 
where N = number of stress cycles; a = 
crack size; a0 = the initial crack size; aN 
= the crack size after N stress cycles; 
F(a) = the geometry function of the 
crack tip ; C = fatigue growth parameter; 
m = fatigue growth exponent; SRE = the 
effective stress range. If Y(a) is defined 
as the indefinite integral of the left side 
term of Eq. (2), the crack growth 
function can then also be represented as: 
[ ]mREN SNCaa ××+YY= - )( 01  (3) 
The number of stress cycles, N, in steel 
bridges can be specifically modified as a 
function of average daily truck traffic 
(ADTT), cycles per truck passage (Cs) 
and service years (Y). For structural 
details and components in a steel bridge, 
the main source of fatigue loadings 
comes from the vehicles, especially 
trucks, passing through the bridge. To 
account for the variable-amplitude stress 
ranges resulted from the random truck 
traffic, the effective stress range SRE 
proposed by Schilling et al. (1978), 
which represents the global effect of 
various stress ranges occurred in the 
detail, can be expressed as follows: 
3/1
1
3
,
þ
ý
ü
î
í
ì
×= å
=
n
i
iRiRE SS g  (4) 
where gi = ratio of the number of SR,i 
stress range amplitude cycles to the total 
 4 
to experience inspections more than 
once before the crack size reaching acr.  
The repair action could occur at any 
inspection while acr ³ aN ³ aR. As a 
result, different repair timings result in 
different crack growth scenarios. In 
order to represent all the possible crack 
growth scenarios that might need to be 
considered after prospective inspections 
and repairs, an event tree analysis is 
needed (see Fig. (1)). The formulation of 
the probability of not detecting a crack, 
Pnd, needs to be modified to include the 
repair effect and event tree analysis: 
jB
n
j
jndnd PPP
b
,
1
, ×= å
=
 (9) 
where Pnd,j is the probability of not 
detecting a crack for branch j scenario, 
which can be evaluated from Eq. (5); 
PB,j is the probability of going to branch 
j scenario, which can be computed by 
the product combination of PR or (1-PR) 
at each inspection time when aN ³ aR 
(see Fig. (1b)); nb is the total number of 
possible scenarios (branches). A new 
quantity E[R] that represents the 
expected number of repairs during the 
service life is generated due to repair 
activities.  E[R] can be evaluated from 
the event tree analysis by collecting the 
PR values at inspections that are 
followed by repair actions. 
 
OPTIMAL NDI TECHNIQUE 
 To transform the selection of a 
proper NDI technique to an optimization 
problem, a cost function reflecting the 
consequence of choosing a NDI 
technique and the associated inspection 
schedule for the considered detail and 
two constraints related to structural 
safety and schedule feasibility need to 
be created. The optimization problem 
for selecting an optimal NDI technique 
and associated inspection schedule may 
be stated as follows: 
[ ] [ ] [ ]ndFRIT
y
PEKREKnEKC ++= min
int POD,
 (10a) 
optimization variables: POD & yint (10b) 
subjected to: [ ] max,ndnd PPE < ;  
 
maxintmin yyy <<  (10c) 
where CT = cost function; KI = cost of a 
single inspection of the specified detail;  
KR = cost of a detail repair after 
inspection; KF = cost associated with a 
failure. Pnd,max = the maximum 
allowable probability of not detecting a 
crack (i.e., the minimum acceptable 
safety level); ymin or ymax = the lower or 
upper bound of inspection interval. In 
cost function CT, the first term (KI E[n]) 
represents the expected cost of 
inspections over the service life. Note 
that, if an NDI technique continuously 
fails to detect the growing crack in the 
detail, the expected fatigue failure 
probability will be high. Hence, E[Pnd] 
gives an indication of the likelihood of 
fatigue failure for the detail over the 
service life as a result of failure to detect 
a crack growing by the selected NDI 
technique. The second term KRE[R] 
denotes the expected cost of repairs over 
the service life. The third term (KFE[Pnd]) 
in CT, therefore, denotes the possible 
costs relating to the failure consequences 
of the considered detail. Pnd,max, defined 
as the maximum allowable probability 
of not detecting a crack (i.e., the 
minimum acceptable safety level) for the 
NDI technique applied on the specified 
fatigue detail, is applied as the first 
constraint to exclude combinations of 
NDI techniques and inspection 
schedules that might be deemed unsafe 
because E[Pnd] is too high. In addition, 
the second constraint sets restrictions on 
the time between inspections so that this 
inter- inspection interval is neither too 
large nor too short. Upon minimizing the 
total cost, an optimum inspection 
interval, yint, may be found. In addition, 
by changing the POD functions, i.e., 
changing the NDI technique, the total 
cost correspond ing to the different  POD 
functions may be compared so as to 
 6 
crack, E[Pnd], and the relative costs of 
inspection and failure. 
(4) Regarding the effect of crack 
detectability, the NDI technique with the 
higher detectability for cracks tends to 
yield a lower E[Pnd] especially for 
schedules with a longer inspection 
interval. This lower E[Pnd] contributes in 
turn to lower costs of failure in the total 
cost. However, an NDI technique with a 
higher crack detectability is usually 
more expensive and involves higher 
inspection costs. 
(5) Regarding the effect of repair 
activities considered in the proposed 
optimization procedure, the longer 
service life set for the detail demands 
more inspections and possible repairs, so 
the increased inspection cost and repair 
cost raise the total costs of the schedules 
with shorter inspection intervals (see Fig. 
(5)). This pushes the optimization result 
to the schedule with longer inspection 
interval.
