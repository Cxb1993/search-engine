ABSTRACT 
Direct current electropulsing was used to improve the plasticity of (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.5Si0.5 
bulk metallic glasses. After the electropulsing treatment, the specimen showed reductions in both 
the glass transition and the crystallization temperatures while retaining its amorphous structure, 
and both Young’s modulus and the hardness decreased while the nanoindentation loading curve 
became more serrated. Using the bond-interface method and Vickers indentation, the treated 
specimen showed more branching of semi-circular shear bands and less radial shear bands 
compared to its as-cast counterpart. The possible plasticity enhancement mechanism of the 
electropulsing treatment was also discussed.

1.	 前言	 
Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are alloys quenched from the melt at a cooling rate high 
enough to suppress nucleation and growth of crystalline phases. The resulting solid amorphous 
material shows no crystalline structure and, hence, no dislocations and grain boundaries. For this 
reason, BMGs constitute a new class of metallic materials with attractive mechanical properties, 
including near theoretical strength, high hardness, extremely low damping characteristics, 
excellent wear properties, and good potential for forming and shaping in the supercooled region 
[1,2]. However, because of the amorphous structure, our traditional understanding of the 
behavior of crystalline metals governed by dislocation plasticity does not apply, and the 
deformation behavior of BMGs is not well understood at the present time even after extensive 
studies. Nevertheless, BMGs often deform by the formation of localized shear bands and display 
little plasticity before catastrophic fracture at room temperature [1–3]. In the past decade, efforts 
have been devoted to improve the plasticity of BMGs, and various methods like reinforcing 
inclusions [4–8] and in situ formation of second phases [9–11] have been developed. Other than

halves with a warm acetone bath for 24 hrs, and the vertical cross-section of Vickers indentation 
was revealed. SEM images of the cross-section were taken using a FEI Quanta 3D FEG.

DSC and selected area electron diffraction were used to characterize the crystallinity of the 
as-cast and the EPT (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)Si0.5 BMGs. The glass transition temperature and the 
crystallization temperature of the as-cast BMG were 754 K and 790 K, respectively, whereas 
those of the EPT BMG were reduced to 750 K and 774 K, respectively. Both curves showed a 
step at glass transition as well as a one-step crystallization peak, implying that the crystallization 
kinetics was unchanged after EPT. High resolution TEM micrographs and diffraction patterns of 
the as-cast and the EPT BMGs are showed, respectively, in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). No crystalline 
phase can be observed in the micrographs and typical diffused rings are shown in the diffraction 
patterns, implying an amorphous structure for both the as-cast and the EPT BMGs. This result 
agreed with Zhang & Shek’s result [24] that EPT only caused peak-shift in DSC while the 
specimen remained amorphous.

amorphous structure of (a) as-cast and (b) EPT BMGs. 
 
The measured Young’s modulus and hardness of BMGs before and after EPT are listed in 
Table 1. The modulus and hardness of the EPT BMG are always lower than those of the as-cast 
BMG. It was suggested that the extent for the BMG to deform plastically could be characterized 
by the following plastic criterion [25]:  
€ 
Rw =
Wp
Wt
=
hf
hmax
 (1) 
where Wp and Wt are the work done by plastic deformation and total deformation, and hf and hmax 
are the residual displacement after unloading and the displacement at the maximum load, 
 5 
both Figs. 3(a) and (b) become smoother as the loading rate increases. This signifies a transition 
from inhomogeneous to homogeneous plastic deformation with the increasing loading rate as 
suggested by Schuh & Nieh [26]. It was concluded that homogeneity under high loading rates 
was due to shear transformation zones (STZs) clustered and moved collectively upon 
deformation. As STZs acted as embryos of shear bands, shear bands would have fewer sites to 
nucleate upon deformation if they responded to deformation in terms of cluster [27]. In the 
present work, serration steps still can be clearly observed at loading rate as high as 1.6 mN/s for 
the EPT BMG while they become almost indistinguishable for the as-cast BMG. Therefore, more 
serrations in the loading curve for the EPT BMG signify more likely to deform with discrete 
plasticity; i.e., forming more shear bands upon deformation. In contrast, serrations in the P-h 
curves of annealing embrittled BMGs are always flattened because of the annihilation of free 
volume by the structural relaxation regardless whether crystallization occurs after annealing 
[28–30].

serrations for EPT-BMG for all loading rates. 
 
Using the bond-interface method, the micrographs of sub-surface shear band patterns 
induced by Vickers indentation on the as-cast and the EPT BMGs are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 
4(b), respectively. The typical shear band pattern; i.e., semi-circular (referred as primary) and 
radial (referred as secondary) shear bands, can be observed in Fig. 4(a). However, a fractured 
region underneath the indenter tip and severe cracking along primary shear bands as indicated by 
arrows in Fig. 4(a) are also observed for the as-cast BMG. In the meanwhile, the radial shear 
bands are less obvious in Fig. 4(b) for the EPT BMG. Instead, the tails of semi-circular shear 
bands are more branched than the as-cast BMG, as indicated by arrows. Higher magnification 
images of the selected area (marked by rectangle) in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) are shown in Figs. 5(a)

Based on the expanding cavity model, it has been shown that the plastic flow underneath the 
indenter is dominated by the compression mechanism which results in the formation of 
semi-circular shear bands [32,33]. Also, using the bond-interface method and Vickers 
indentation, shear band patterns have been studied for various BMGs. While the patterns reveal 
more semi-circular shear bands for highly ductile Pd-based BMGs, [34,35], radial shear bands 
are more prone to form for less-ductile Zr- or Fe-based BMGs [32,33]. Hence, it can be 
concluded that the EPT BMG is more ductile than the as-cast BMG based on the observed shear 
band morphologies shown in Figs. 4 and 5. 
Based on Yu et al.’s work [28], more secondary shear bands were observed after the 
annealing treatment of Zr-based BMGs. In this case, BMG becomes more brittle after annealing 
which is the opposite in comparison with the present EPT BMG. Using the free volume theory 
[36,37], the flow mechanism of BMGs can be interpreted in terms of the free volume, which can 
be treated as defects in amorphous alloys similar to vacancies in crystalline materials. Annealing 
would result in the structure relaxation of BMGs, such that the free volume is redistributed and 
annihilated which, in turn, results in the loss of plasticity. 
While the shear band morphology is correlated with the deformation mechanism, it can be 
concluded that EPT modifies the mechanical property of Zr-based BMG in a way different from 
annealing. Summarizing above observations, EPT lowers the shear band onset stress in Zr-based 
BMGs such that more shear bands can be initiated to provide plasticity, evidenced by both 
serrations in nanoindentation and the shear band morphology from the bond-interface method 
and Vickers indentation. For BMGs with limited macroscopic plasticity, the deformation is 
highly localized, such that the plastic strain is accumulated in a few very narrow shear bands 
exhibiting strain softening [37]. Plasticity enhancement can be achieved by dense pattern [38,39] 
or branching [40] of shear bands. It has been concluded that more homogeneous nucleation and 
continuous multiplication and branching of shear bands during deformation can better 
accommodate the applied strain and prevent damage from strain accumulation at localized shear 
bands [40]. Therefore, in our case plasticity is enhanced as branched shear bands delocalize 
deformation upon indentation. This also leads to less cracking between primary shear bands for 
the EPT-BMG as shown in Fig. 4b. 
The above distinct results for the EPT-BMG might result from the different ways in heating 
up BMGs. For annealing, heating is achieved by heat conduction, convection, and radiation. 
However, for EPT, it is joule heating with electrons dissipating part of the electrical energy as 
heat, and the BMG is rapidly heated up from the internal. Also, part of the electrical energy 
could transfer the momentum to the atom by electron bombardment; i.e., the electromigration 
(EM) force. Studies in the Nineties have found that DC would exert EM force on BMGs, 
inducing internal stress in the crystalline alloy. However, to result in the same magnitude of

bowtie nanostructures have recently been shown to give a large enhancement factor 
sufficient for single molecule detection.  In this work, we simulate the plasmon 
resonance for periodic gold bowtie nanostructures.  The difference between the dipole 
and the quadrupole resonances is described by examining the magnitude and phase of 
electric field, the bound surface charge, and the polarization.  The gap size 
dependence of the field enhancement can be interpreted by considering cavity field 
enhancement.  Also, additional enhancement is obtained through the long-range 
collective photonic effect when the bowtie array periodicity matches the resonance 
wavelength. 
In addition to the above work, ellipse nanostructures have been processed recently 
at ORNL and Fig. 1 shows the nanostructures with different periodicities.  Surface-
enhanced Raman scattering from these nanostructures has also been measured.  The 
PI will perform finite-difference time-domain simulations to compare with the 
experimental results.  Publication from this collaboration is expected.

“Controlled-Shear Tests of Bulk Metallic Glasses” at UTK.  The abstract of the 
presentation is as follows. 
Abstract: Limited plasticity inhibits the engineering applications of bulk metallic 
glasses (BMGs), which often deform by the formation of localized shear bands.  
Overcoming the brittleness of BMGs necessitates advances in our understanding of 
the mechanisms of shear band initiation and propagation.  Up to now, a major hurdle 
has been the ability to control the generation of shear bands and the associated 
fracture.  A unique loading fixture is demonstrated in the present study which allows 
one not only to control the locations of shear band formation and shear fracture but 
also to alter the ratio of the normal to shear stress on the fracture plane.  The ability of 
controlling the location of shear bands paves the way for in-situ observations of (i) the 
initiation and propagation of shear bands, and (ii) how shear bands interact with 
second-phases and particles when they are used for ductility enhancement of BMGs.  
The capability of altering the stress ratio allows one to systematically examine how 
the normal stress affects shear fracture of BMGs.
