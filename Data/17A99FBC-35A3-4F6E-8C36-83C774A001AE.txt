Abstract
For a preventive maintenance (PM) model
with failure rate reduction over a finite time
span, it is found from literature that a shorter
interval between each PM (T) can result in a
better expected total maintenance cost (TC). The
optimal policy of the stated PM model (called
the original PM model in this paper) is usually
obtained by searching the value of T over the
specified range [Tmin, Tmax) for every given
number of PM (N) which has the minimal TC.
However, the original PM model does limit the
possibility of finding a smaller TC since the
value of T is constrained in the range of [Tmin,
Tmax). In this paper, we propose a new
failure-rate-reduction PM model in a finite time
period which can have a better optimal solution
than the corresponding original PM model by
releasing the constraint of the searching range of
T. The algorithm of finding the optimal solution
for the new model is developed. Examples are
provided and are compared with the
corresponding original PM model.

1. Introduction
For a deteriorating and repairable system, the preventive maintenance (PM) can slow
down the aging process and restore the system to a younger state (Pham and Wang [1],
Nakagawa [2]). It can be seen that most of the PM models are defined over the infinite time
span where the theoretical optimal PM policy is obtained based on the long-term
expectation of failure occurrences. These PM models have the assumption that the system
in each replacement cycle has the same conditions and costs. Thus, the optimal solution
(policy) is obtained by minimizing the expected average cost over a single replacement

3.1 The Algorithm For The Modified Model
1. Let N = 0, TN = L,N = 0.
2. Calculate Cmin = TC(N, TN, N) using Eq.(4) or (5). (Note: Cmin equals to the
expected total maintenance cost of no PM being performed.)
3. Let N = 1.
4. Calculate TU = L/N.
5. Use Nelder-Mead method to Search the values of TN in the range of (0, TU] and
N in the range of [0, 1] such that TC(N, TN, N) shown in Eq. (4) or (5) is
minimized;
let C0 = minimal value of TC(N, TN,N).
6. If C0Cmin then obtain the optimal solution:
N* = N-1, T* = TN*,* =N*, and TC(N*,T*,*); stop,
else
let N = N+1 and Cmin = C0; go to Step 4.
4. Numerical Examples
Some numerical examples are performed and the optimal solutions of the modified PM
model are compared with those of the original PM model proposed by Cheng and Liu [5].
The conditions of these numerical examples are described as follows: L=5; Cmr=1; and
Cpm is defined by Eq.(2); the coefficients a, b, and c of Cpm are assigned with different
values as shown in Tables 1. The system’s life is assumed to follow Weibull distribution
with scale parameter=1 and shape parameter= 1.5, 2.5, and 3.
Table 1 shows the optimal solutions for the examples. It can be found that the* = 1
for each example. From Eq.(2) and Figure 2, we know that δ* =λ(T*) which implies that
the 1st PM becomes a perfect maintenance. This implication is same as the result
obtained in the original PM model.
The values of TC marked with shadow are examples with the modified PM model
having better optimal solution than the original PM model while the others examples
reveal that both PM models have the same optimal solutions. It can be seen that the
modified PM model is preferred for all the examples of= 1.5. When further examining
the optimal solution of the examples, it can be noticed that those with larger optimal TC
are from the original PM model and have the fully-periodic PM policy (with N*=1 and
T* =2.5) and the others have the partially-periodic PM policy. It can also be seen from
Table 1 that a PM model with a shorter PM interval does provide a better optimal
solution. This makes the proposed hypothesis acceptable.
We also analyze the sensitivity of each parameter to the optimal solution for the
proposed new PM model by using the ANOVA method as shown in Table 2. It can be
found thatand c are significantly sensitive to the optimal total maintenance cost TC.
5. Conclusions
For the preventive maintenance problem in a finite time span, based on the fact that a
shorter time interval of PM can result in a better expected total maintenance cost, a
modified PM model with failure rate reduction and the algorithm for finding the optimal

Abstract—For a repairable and deteriorating system, the 
theoretical preventive maintenance (PM) models are usually 
complicated and need numerical methods to obtain the optimal 
PM policies since the system’s hazard rate function is changed 
after each PM. It makes the application of the theoretical 
model not quite suitable for real cases. Moreover, the 
theoretical optimal PM solution is obtained by assuming the 
system is evaluated over an infinite time span. Yet, in reality, 
the deteriorating systems always have a finite life time.  Hence, 
searching for an optimal PM solution in a finite time span 
might not be rational for a deteriorating system. Therefore, we 
consider using the simulation method to obtain a range of the 
near-optimal PM policy.  The critical step of the simulation 
method for obtaining a near-optimal PM policy is the 
generation of the random variates (RV). Since the rejection 
method is a simple and easy-to-use method in simulating the 
failure process of a PM model, it is applied to generate the RVs 
of the time-between-failures (TBF) for the finite-time-span PM 
model with age reduction effect. In this research, examples of 
the near-optimal PM policies are presented and discussed.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
For a deteriorating system, the theoretical preventive 
maintenance (PM) models are usually complicated and need 
numerical methods to obtain the optimal PM policies since 
the system’s hazard rate function is changed after each PM.  
This limits the application of the theoretical model in real 
world. Furthermore, the theoretical optimal PM policy is 
obtained based on the long-term failures occurrence under 
the assumption of the infinite time span. Yet, in reality, the 
life time of a system is always finite. Hence, the optimal 
solution from the theoretical model may not suitable for a 
single system with finite life time. In practical, a near-
optimal PM policy might be good enough for the real 
applications. In order to obtain a near-optimal PM policy for 
the real situations, the simulation method is applied to 
generate random variates (RV) of the time between failures 
(TBF). However, recent literature survey has shown that 
little research has been done in using the simulation method 
to obtain a near-optimal PM policy. 
The critical step of the simulation method for obtaining a 
near-optimal PM policy is the generation of the random 
variates (RV). In this research, Rejection method is 
developed to generate the time-between-failures (TBF) RVs 
for the finite-time-span PM model with age reduction effect. 
Cheng [1] applies the inverse transformation method to 
generate the RVs of the TBF for a PM model with age 
reduction effect. The algorithm developed by Cheng [1] 
requires the derivation of the cumulative failure distribution 
functions for each PM. It makes the algorithm difficult to use. 
Since the rejection method is commonly applied in 
generating the RVs with complicated distributions [2], we 
develop an algorithm which applies the rejection method to 
generate the RVs of the TBF for the age-reduced PM model 
in this paper. Examples of finding the near-optimal PM 
policies are also provided and discussed.

else j = j; m = m+1; go back to Step 4. 
10. If tm < L, let i = i + 1 and j = 1; go back to Step 7 
else stop. 
It can be seen that the rejection method is easy to use 
since it does not need to derive the formula of Ri(t) for i = 1, 
2, …, N. 
IV. EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION 
In the examples, let the finite life time period (L) be 6 
time units and the PM interval (T) be 1 time unit. The values 
of parameters are set as: θ = 0.4; N = 5; Cpm = a+bi = 5+100i 
for the ith PM; Cmr =3.1036. The near-optimal solutions are 
obtained by the simulation method with 30 runs. 
A. Example 1 
Table I shows the parameter values used in the proposed 
simulation models as well as in the theoretical model of Yeh 
and Chen [3]. In this example, we assume the PM restoration 
value (γ) for each N is pre-determined, which is same as the 
optimal restoration value obtained from Yeh and Chen [3] as 
shown in Table 2. The 30-run simulation results for N = 1 to 
6 using the rejection method are presented in Table 3. The 
smallest (best) total maintenance cost of each run is 
highlighted with shadow background. 
It can be seen from Table 3 that, for each N, the average 
value of TC from the 30-run simulation is very close to the 
value obtained by using the theoretical method based on Yeh 
and Chen [3]. Both methods (simulation and theoretical 
model) provides the same optimal policy of N*=3 and 
γ*=0.4781. It has demonstrated that the experimental results 
obtained by simulation method are consistent with those 
obtained by the theoretical model when large sample runs are 
generated. 
It should be noted that the best solution of N, γ, and TC 
(marked with shadow) resulted from each simulation run are 
different from those obtained by the theoretical model. It is 
because the optimal solution of the theoretical model is 
obtained by taking the expected cost rate over the infinite 
time interval or over the large number of systems in a finite 
time interval. However, the simulation method considers the

situations of a single system in a finite time interval, which is 
more close to the real situation. 
For a single system in a finite time span, according to 
Table 3, the best solutions of each run (with shadow) can be 
categorized into three near-optimal policies: (N=2, γ=0.6667), 
(N=3, γ=0.4781), and (N=4, γ=0.3655). Table 4 lists the 
simulation runs in each category of the near-optimal policy 
and presents the average, the smallest, and the largest 
minimal TC of the near-optimal policy. Among these best 
solutions, the average of the minimal TC (184.1143) is 
smaller than the theoretical minimal TC (189.7280). The 
results have demonstrated that the theoretical PM model 
might not be suitable for a single system over a finite time 
interval. 
Hence, in practical, when considering a single system to 
be preventively maintained in a finite time period, especially 
for short time period, more than one single near-optimal 
policy is suggested. In this example, either (N=2, γ=0.6667) 
or (N=3, γ=0.4781) or (N=4, γ=0.3655) may be chosen as the 
best (near-optimal) PM policy. 
B. Example 2 
In this example, we assume that the PM restoration value 
(γ) for each N is a decision variable and has to be determined 
from the simulation method. Therefore, different values of γ  
are used for each N. We let γ = 0.2T, 0.5T, 0.8T, 0.985T, and 
γ*(the theoretical optimal value). Using the rejection method,
