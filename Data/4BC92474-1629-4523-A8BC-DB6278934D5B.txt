ABSTRACT 
In general, the model used to analysis or 
design control systems is only an 
approximation of the actual plant transfer 
function. The most common models used for 
stable plants are a first-order plus dead-time or 
second order plus dead-time model and for 
integrating processes a pure integrating plus 
dead-time or an integrating plus first-order 
plus dead-time model. 
The Proportional-integral-derivative 
(PID) controllers are the most common 
control algorithms. Due to their simplicity and 
robustness, the PID controllers are widely 
used. During the last five years, we 
established an intelligent controller and 
proposed some new tuning rules (Based on 
genetic algorithm.) for PID controllers for 
stable plants. 
It is known that the Smith predictor (SP) 
has been used as an effective control scheme 
for stable systems with dead-time. However, 
the disturbance response of the classical SP is 
sometime unsatisfactory. When the SP is used 
and the process has an integral mode, a 
constant load disturbance results in a 
steady-state error. Recently, there are many 
modifications have been proposed for SP to 
improve the disturbance performance. These 
modifications concerned with the problem of 
designing linear controllers for plants which 
are assumed to be linear. In fact, the actuators 
associated with any implementation limit the 
magnitude of the signal entering the plant. 
However, any controller with relative slow 
modes will experience windup problems if 
there are actuator saturations. Till now, there 
still no literature that proposed the 
anti-windup scheme for SP and its 
modifications.  
The goals of this project are to (1) 
propose PID tuning rules for integrating plants; 
(2) analysis the structure of SP and its 
modifications and propose the anti-windup 
scheme for each modification.  
Keywords ： Genetic algorithm, PID 
controllers, tuning rules, second-order plus 
integrator systems. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
PID controller is the most common 
control algorithm and is widely used. There 
are a lot of tuning rules for PID controllers 
(Ziegler et al., 1942, Cohen et al., 1953, Smith 
et al., 1985, Shinkey, 1988, Morari et al., 1989, 
Chien et al., 1990, Hang et al., 1991, Astrom 
et al., 1993, Zhaung et al., 1993, Astrom et al., 
1995, Ho et al., 1995, Abbas, 1997, Ho et al., 
1997, Wang et al., 1999, Shen, 2000, 2001, 
2002, 2006, Hagglund et al., 2002, Haeri, 
2002). Most of the tuning rules are derived 
under idealized assumptions, such as infinite 
constant 1>m  represents the minimal 
requirement of stability robustness (In this 
study, we let m = 2.0 .). Clearly, this is a 
constrained nonlinear optimization problem. 
In this paper, the genetic algorithm that 
proposed by Shen (2002) is used to solve this 
optimization problem. 
 
DERIVATION OF THE TUNING RULES 
The PID controller design method 
described in last section is a time consuming 
procedure. If we can find simple formulas that 
describe the relations between the parameters 
of PID controller, the parameters that 
characterize the system dynamics, the user can 
obtain proper PID controller parameters easily 
and need not to run the entire design 
procedure. In this section, the way to derive 
the tuning rules will be described. 
The closed-loop transfer function of the 
system G  controlled by the PID controller 
described in (4) is

is the normalized system model. Systems with 
the same K , iT , dT , b  and ζ  will have 
similar responses, both in time and frequency 
domain. The only difference is in the scale of 
time and frequency axis (scaled by ωn ). If we 
can find the relations between ζ  and the 
normalized control parameters, and represent 
K , iT , dT  and b  as functions of ζ , these 
functions can be used to tune the PID 
controllers for the systems that modeled by 
G . 
For deriving the tuning rules, the PID 
controllers for the normalized systems G  
with ζ =0.05, 0.1, 0.15, K , 2.0 were 
designed. Then the normalized controller 
parameters were plotted as functions of ζ . 
We then utilized curve fitting technique to 
find the relations between the normalized 
controller parameters and ζ .  
Fig. 1 depicts the designed results for 
normalized system G . It can be found in Fig. 
1, the normalized controller gain K  
increased rapidly with ζ  and ranges from 
0.05 to 20, the normalized integration time iT  
ranges from 1.5 to 5.5, the normalized 
derivation time dT  ranges from 0.2 to 1.5, 
and the setpoint weighting b  ranges from 
0.45 to 0.9. Note that the values of iT , dT  
and b  vary in large ranges for small ζ . 
This indicates that it is difficult to tune the 
PID controller for the systems with small ζ .  
For reference, the bandwidth of the 
resulted closed-loop system is shown in Fig. 2. 
It can be found that the bandwidth of the 
optimal system ranges from 0.15 nω  to 
2.5 nω . 
Now, we are going to derive the tuning 
rules for systems that can be modeled by G . 
The values of iT , dT  and b  vary in large 
ranges for small ζ . For obtaining better 
fitting results, the data of these parameters are 
separated into two groups before the curve 
fitting process is performed. Table 1 lists the 
fitting results. The curves of the fitting results 
also been shown in Fig. 1.

III. SYSTEM MODELING AND CONTROLLER DESIGN 
This section describes the way to model the piezoelectric 
actuated system and how to design the feedback controller. 
Firstly, PI hysteresis model is used to model the hysteresis 
nonlinearity of actuator and the inverse of this model is 
used to cancel out the hysteresis nonlinearity. Then the 
linearized model of the piezoelectric actuated system is 
estimated and an integral sliding mode controller is 
designed to compensate the remaining uncertainties and 
disturbances. 
 
3.1 Prandtl-Ishlinsjii Hysteresis Model 
The elementary operator in the PI hysteresis model is a 
backlash operator (see Fig. 2). A backlash operator is 
defined by

r  is the magnitude of backlash. The initial condition of (1) 
is given by 
}},)0(min{,)0(max{)0( 0yrxrxy +−=  
Where initial state Ry ∈0 , and is usually but not 
necessarily initialized to 0. 
Hysteretic nonlinearities can be modeled by a linearly 
weighted superposition of many backlash operators with 
different threshold and weight values,

where iw  are the weightings, ir  are the threshold values 
with nrrr <<<= ...0 10  and iy0  are the initial states. 
The control input threshold values ir  are usually chosen 
to be equal intervals. 
To find the parameters of hysteresis model, the responses 
of the actuator must be measured experimentally. Then the 
values of ir  are selected and the weight parameters iw  
are found by doing a least square fit of equation (2) to the 
response data of actuator. Fig. 3 shows the hysteresis 
response of the actuator and its PI model (n=14).

Ensuring a sliding regime 0=S  requires consideration 
of the Lyapunov candidate 25.0 SV = . Differentiating V 
with respect to time and substituting (8-11) to obtain ( )[ ])()(sign)( tSSezSV φη +−=−= &&&    (14) 
From (13) and (14), it is seen that  
0 if0 ≠< SV&           (15) 
Thus the sliding condition is satisfied. Note that 
)0()0( ez = , therefore 
0=S   for  0=t           (16) 
From (15) and (16), it can be concluded that the sliding 
mode exists at all times, i.e., 
0=S&   for all 0≥t         (17) 
Denote the equivalent value of ψ  as eqψ . Since 0=S& , 
eqψ  can be determined from (8), (10) and (11): 
φψ −=eq              (18) 
This means that the equivalent value of ψ  equals the 
uncertainties and disturbances. By selecting eqd Tu ψ= , 
the uncertainties and disturbances can be compensated. It 
was shown in [10] that the equivalent eqψ  is equal to the 
average value measured by a first-order linear filter with 
the switched action as its input. Therefore, du  can be 
written as 
eqavd TTu ψψ ==             (19) 
with 
ψψψτ =+ avav& .             (20) 
The time constant τ  should be made small enough that 
the plant and disturbance dynamics are allowed to pass 
through the filter without significant phase delay. 
Substituting (19) and (9) into (8) yields 
φψλ −−=+ eqee& ,           (21) 
which is equivalent to 0=+ ee λ& . This equation 
represents the desired error dynamics. 
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In order to identify the nominal time constant T  and 
estimate the bound of Δ , step response tests at various 
working points are executed. From the test results, it was 
found that the time constant of this stage lies between 2.2 
and 3.5 ms. When designing the controller, λ  is chosen as 
large as possible to obtain wider bandwidth. The final 
controller parameters are chosen as follows: 550=λ , 
20=η  and 0018.0=τ . 
In order to check the performance of this control method, 
sinusoidal waves with mμ9  amplitude and different 
frequencies range from 1-20Hz were used to test the 
tracking performance. Fig. 8 depicts the tracking results of 
10Hz signal. Table 1 summarizes the maximum tracking 
errors of tracking test at different frequencies. Comparison 
was made with the integral sliding-mode controller 
(without inverse model compensation). It can be found 
from Table 1 that the inverse model compensation can 
improve the tracking accuracy significantly. Fig. 9 shows 
the tracking results of a multi-frequency, nonstationary 
dynamic motion profile (modulated 2 and 10 Hz sinusoids 
with varying amplitudes). The maximum tracking error is 
mμ039.0 . It can be seen that the output still can track the 
reference very well. For determining the precision of the 
tracking control, a 5Hz sine wave with 4nm amplitude was 
used to command the stage. Fig. 10 shows the trajectory 
following results of this stage to 4nm amplitude input. For 
very small amplitude of reference position of 4nm which is 
almost the same as the magnitude of noise, the measured 
position still tracked the reference fairly well. It can be 
concluded that the tracking resolution is about 4nm. In 
order to determine the closed-loop bandwidth of this stage, 
a mμ9  magnitude sinusoidal signal was command to this 
nano-stage. The frequency of the command motion was 
slowly increased until an attenuation of 0.707 in the 
tracking magnitude. The measured bandwidth was 
approximately 80 Hz. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This article reported the precision tracking control of a 
piezoelectric actuated motion stage. Firstly, Prandtl- 
Ishlinskii (PI) model is used to model the hysteresis 
nonlinearity of the actuator. Then, the inverse PI model 
was used to reduce the hysteresis nonlinearity and a 
sliding-mode controller was used to compensate the 
remaining nonlinear uncertainty and disturbances. The
