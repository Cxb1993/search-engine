1Abstract
Kelvin probe force microscopy is currently used to measure contact potential difference and
topography of sample on a nanometer scale, based on the behaviors of the first two resonant
frequencies. In this project, an analytical method to determine the frequency shifts of several
modes in dynamic force microscopy subjected to a.c. electrostatic force is proposed. The
numerical results determined by the proposed method are close to the experimental ones. If the
amplitude and the frequency of the a.c. voltage are suitable, a large frequency shift and a linear
relation between the frequency shift and the tip-sample distance will be obtained. In other words,
properly controlling the a.c. voltage will increase the accuracy of measuring the sample’s
topography. Moreover, it is found that even without an optimized compensation d.c. voltage,
increasing the first frequency shift and decreasing the tip radius and the half open angle of the tip
can increase the accuracy of measuring a step height. Finally, it is found that when the oscillation
amplitude and the tip-sample distance are constant, increasing the negative d.c. voltage will
increase the accuracy of the measurement of contact potential by using the frequency shift. In
addition, an assessment of the conventional perturbation method is presented and the two
methods are compared.

1. Introduction
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is now widely used for imaging the surfaces of materials
from the micrometer to the subnanometer scale. Atomic force microscopy with the frequency
modulation technique (FM-AFM) has been developed as a powerful tool for obtaining
atomic-scale images and also information about tip-surface interactions [1, 2]. When a.c. and d.c.
biased voltages are applied to a conventional AFM, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is
obtained. It is a powerful measuring technique on a nanometer scale using atomic force
microscopy with an electrostatic force. It is currently used to image the protein [3] and the
contact potential difference on a large variety of samples, such as semiconductor [4, 5] and
organic materials [6].
It is well known that a quantitative interpretation of the AFM signal invariably depends upon
the tip geometry and the model of the electrostatic force. Studies [7-10] have been published on
the effects of the tip geometry and the model of the electrostatic force. Belaid et al. [7] calculated
3where mt is the tip mass, W the flexural displacement, E the Young's modulus, x the coordinate
along the beam, and L the length of the beam. A and I denote the cross sectional area and the
area moment of inertia, respectively. is the mass density per unit volume. F is the interacting
force composed of the background force and the electrostatic force as follows:
bg esF F F  (6)
where Fbg represents any non-voltage-dependent background term originating from, for
example, the van der Waals force. The van der Waals force [16] is

where AH is the Hamaker constant, D the tip-surface distance, R the tip radius, and Fes the

a.c.-voltage Vac at a frequency a is superimposed on the tip-sample voltage Vdc. Then the
electrostatic force is expressed as [13]

are the same as Eqs. (22b). Because the coefficients 1af

and

depend on the a.c.-frequencya, the frequency shift also depends ona.
Because the distributed parameter system is simulated by a concentrated mass one in the
perturbation method, one degree of freedom is considered. In other words, the perturbation
method can determine correctly the first resonant frequency only. Unfortunately, the first
resonant frequency is used to measure a sample’s topography and the second resonant frequency
for the potential measurement in AM mode [13]. It is concluded that the conventional
perturbation method is not suitable for the potential measurement in AM mode. This conclusion
is numerically verified and presented in Figure 2b. Further, there are background and electrostatic
interacting forces. Because they are applied to the tip simultaneously and the system is nonlinear,
the total frequency shift cannot be determined theoretically by the superposition method used in
the perturbation method. A comparison of the first two frequency shifts determined by the
proposed method and the perturbation method are demonstrated in Figures 2a and 2b.
5. Numerical results and discussion
Assume that the probe is made of silicon dioxide. The tip is modeled as a spherical apex and
cone. The corresponding derivative of the capacitance modeled by Hudlet et al. [10] is used. The
Young's modulus E = 70.3×109 Pa. The mass density per unit volume = 2.5×103 kg/m3. The
uniform beam is considered. The corresponding bending rigidity and mass parameter are b = m
=1. The corresponding normalized fundamental solutions are

The comparison of the first two resonant frequencies determined by the proposed analytical
method and the perturbation method is presented in Figure 2. Figures 2a and 2b show the first and
second resonant frequency shifts, respectively. Figure 2a shows that the first frequency shifts due
to the van der Waals force and the a.c.-electrostatic ones, determined by the perturbation method,
are slightly different from those determined by the analytical method. However, because the
background and electrostatic forces are applied to the tip simultaneously and the system is
nonlinear, the total frequency shift may not be determined theoretically by the superposition
method like the relation described in equation (29). Figure 2b shows that the error of the second
frequency shift determined by the perturbation method is very large. The reason is that the
effective spring constant k of the first mode is different from that of the second mode. Using the
9can increase the accuracy of measuring a step height.
Based on experimental results, Sommerhalter et al. [12] and Glatzel et al. [13] proposed
that the first resonance should be assigned for the tip height control and the second resonance for
the potential measurement. The reason is theoretically addressed in Figure 6. Figures 6a and 6c
show the relations between the contact potential and the tip-sample distance with the frequency
shifts 1 2 10 Hzf f   , and 1 2 100 Hzf f   , respectively. In Figures 6a and 5c, the
compensation voltage Vdc is not equal to the contact potential Vcp. It is observed from Figure 6a
that in the first resonance and without a compensation voltage, the variation of the tip-sample
distance is about 1.45 nm between the contact potential of 0 and 0.6 V. For the compensation
voltages of -0.5 and 1 V, the variations of the tip-sample distance are about 5.33 and –4.42 nm,
respectively. It means that an unsuitable compensation voltage Vdc will induce a wrong measured
height. However, without a compensation voltage and with 1 100 Hzf  , the variation of the
tip-sample distance is about 0.09 nm. It means that without the compensation voltage the
accuracy of measuring the topography with 1 100 Hzf  is better than that with
1 10 Hzf  . Figure 6b shows the relation between the contact potential and the tip-sample
distance with 1 2 10 Hzf f   and a compensation voltage Vdc equal to the contact potential
Vcp. It is found that the influence of the contact potential on the tip-sample distance is negligible.
In other words, with a proper compensation voltage the sample’s topography can be measured
accurately. Further, it is observed from Figure 5 that when the compensation voltage is negative,
the step height will be overestimated. When the compensation voltage is positive, the step height
will be underestimated. The reason, presented in Figure 6a, is that when the compensation
voltage is negative or positive, the slop dD0/dVcp is positive or negative.
Figure 6a shows that with a fixed frequency shift and amplitude, the tip-sample distance in
the second mode changes slightly with the contact potential. Moreover, the influence of the bias
voltage Vdc on the relation between the tip-sample distance for the second mode and the contact
potential is slight. When the second frequency shift and the tip amplitude are constant, influence
of the contact potential on the tip-sample distance is negligible. It means that when the second
frequency shift and the tip amplitude are constant, the sensitivity of the potential measurement is
very small. Although the compensation dc voltage is given, the contact potential cannot be
measured accurately.
Figure 7 shows the influence of the dc bias voltage Vdc on the relation between the first two
frequency shifts and the contact potential with constant oscillation amplitude and tip-sample
distance. When Vdc = 0.5 V, increasing the contact potential increases the first two frequency
shifts. When 0dcV  , it is the reverse. Further, the larger the negative dc bias voltage Vdc, the
larger the absolute slope /i cpd f dV . Moreover, when the negative dc bias voltage Vdc is large
enough, the curves of  1, cpf V and  2 , cpf V are almost linear. It is helpful for the
measurement of contact potential to use the frequency shift.
6. Conclusion
Analytical solutions for the frequency shifts of several modes of non-uniform AFM subjected
to a.c.-electrostatic force are obtained. It is revealed that the conventional perturbation method
