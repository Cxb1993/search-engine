ABSTRACT
The isolation and characterization of the indigenous dioxin-biotransformation
bacteria of Taiwan whad been investigated in this study group. Using that
consequence, the culture enrichment, and strains acclimation were also conducted for
the isolated bacteria for bioremediation. The soil samples, Tainan#1, Tainan#2 and
Tainan#3 which gathering from the downstream of the announced dioxin
contamination site in southern part of Taiwan, and analyze PCDDs/PCDFs
concentration to confirm the contamination of the soil. Accordingly, Tainan#3 has the
highest total toxic equivalence, 2450ng- TEQ/kg of the contaminants. After go
through ten sub-culture inoculum, four bacteria strains which can survive in dioxin
media were isolated. The identification results shown that the strains were
Achromobacter xylosoxidans、Ochrobactrum anthropi、Ralstonia mannitolilytica and
Agromyces sp.. The morphology of the strains shown that all of the strains aregram’s 
negative. The configuration of the strain presented that Ochrobactrum anthropi and
Agromyces sp. obtain the length and width of 2μm and 1μm, which are bigger than
others. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Agromyces sp. is the closest with
Mycobacterium chlorophenolicum strain PCP-1, which is a PCP-degrading bacterium
that with bootstrap value of 95.
According the growth test, it decrease inhibition of growth by add 1000 mg/L
glucose in the culture contain 10 μg/kg of 2378PCDD. The kinetic analysis shown
the bacterium Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Ochrobactrum anthropi achieve the
best growth condition with the maximum specific growth rate of 0.115h-1. Ralstonia
mannitolilytica has the smallest Ks with the value of 43.2 mg/L. In substrate inhibitory,
Ochrobactrum anthropi has the greatest inhibition coefficient of 0.948 mg/L.
Concerning the dioxin degradation, strain Achromobacter xylosoxidans 、
Ochrobactrum anthropi、Agromyces sp., can degraded 2,3,7,8-TCDD in lag phase,
however, the result for the strain of Ralstonia mannitolilytica is not observed. For
Ralstonia mannitolilytica, log phase is the major decomposition period for
2,3,7,8-TCDD. In these strains, Agromyces sp. has the better degradation efficiency
than the others, and the 2,3,7,8-TCDD was decline by 97%. The biotransformation
enzyme for the toxicant 2,3,7,8-TCDD request more study.
The proteomics study using SDS-PAGE of 10%, 12.5%, and 15% gel with 120
voltage for 60 minutes, and finding the proteomics expression as follow. The 40 and
50 kD protein was increase when the strain sustained Achromobacter xylosoxidans in
the culture contain 2,3,7,8-TCDD of 10 mg/L. Similar results were found by
Ochrobactrum anthropi. However, the 50 kD protein not increase as Achromobacter
xylosoxidans. For Ralstonia mannitolilytica, most of the protein were decline in the
PAGE except 120kDa. A different result was found by Agromyces sp. which only
found the protein variation in 20 and 120 kD.

四、結果與討論
1. 戴奧辛分解菌鑑定結果
16SrDNA 菌種鑑定結果
本研究將菌株序列分別以NCBI與商用的Applied Biosystem資料庫進行比對
鑑定，各菌株相似度最高的菌種名稱整理如表 1，NCBI 資料庫比對結果顯示，
A 菌株相似度比對結果以 Achromobacter xylosoxidans clone B5 為最高 99.7%，B、
C、D 菌株均以 Ochrobactrum anthropi strain SRK5 為最高。雖然 C 菌株第二繼代
比對結果為 Ochrobactrum anthropi strain AS5，但其相似度僅為 96.88%，故此比
對結果不予採用。E菌株比對以Ralstonia mannitolilytica strain SDV相似度 99.72%
為最高， F 菌株比對結果以 Agromyces sp. BJS1 的相似度最高 99.84%。在 Applied
Biosystem 資料庫比對方面，A、B、C、D 菌株的比對結果與 NCBI 資料庫大致
相同，但 E 菌株比對之結果則為 Ralstonia pickettii，而 F 菌株比對結果以 Agrom-
yces mediolanus 的相似度為最高。
以上結果顯示，A、B、C、D 菌株在 NCBI 資料庫與 Applied Biosystem 資
料庫的比對結果相同，因此可確定 A 菌株其名稱為 Achromobacter xylosoxidans，
菌株 B、C、D 均為 Ochrobactrum anthropi。E 菌株在兩資料庫核酸序列比對之
結果則略有不同，其中 Applied Biosystem 資料庫比對結果的相似度僅 98.70%，

2、蛋白質體分析結果
為了清楚分析培養基中戴奧辛的變化，先以Agromyces sp.及Achromobacter
xylosoxidans兩株菌進行蛋白質體分析，首先將分別培養48小時後的菌液進行濃
縮後，以10% gel進行SDS-PAGE分析，將每個槽注入25ul的樣品，以120V、60
分鐘進行分析，結果顯示Figure 4.1分子量25K以下的蛋白都已跑掉，所以無法清
楚了解此區蛋白是否有差異，因此將再以12.5% gel進行分析。
Figure 4.1 SDS-PAGE analysis for dioxin degraders.The proteins introduced to dioxin degraders were
as follow:

lane 4, Achromobacter xylosoxidansgrowths in 1000mg/L glucose and 10μg/L 2,3,7,8-TCDD
再以Agromyces sp.及Achromobacter xylosoxidans兩株菌進行蛋白質體分析，
將蛋白濃縮後，以12.5% gel進行SDS-PAGE分析，將每個槽注入25ul的樣品，以
120V、60分鐘進行分析，結果顯示Figure 4.1比Figure 4.2 較為清楚，可以明顯看
出兩株菌在添加戴奧辛後蛋白質皆有所不同，但是結果還是不清楚，所以必須再
做一次SDS-PAGE。
xylosoxidans 兩株菌培養基增加至 200ml，培養 48 小時後的菌液進行濃縮後，以
12.5% gel 進行 SDS-PAGE 分析，由 Figure 4.4 可以看出在蛋白質量有明顯增加，
且在 lane 3 小分子量的位置能看出有差異，但由於 lane 1 再跑電泳時失敗，所以
會有一條藍線，因此還需要再一次進行分析。
Figure 4.4 SDS-PAGE analysis for dioxin degraders.The proteins introduced to dioxin degraders were
as follow:

同樣的樣品再以12.5% gel進行SDS-PAGE分析，由Figure 4.5 這次背景值就
明顯少了很多，蛋白也相對的較明顯。

This conference were smoothly took place for whole three days for all the oral presentation
and Postor presentation, and over 500 papers were presented in this conference.
2. 與會之學術心得與建議
My paper entitled of “The Screening of Dioxin Biotransformation Bacteria from the
Contaminated Soil(受污染土壤中戴奧辛分解菌之篩選與特性分析)” was presented in 
this conference. It major presents the toxicant dioxin in the soil, which reaction to the soil
microorganisms. Four strains of the bacteria isolated from our lab. include Achromobacter
xylosoxidans, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Ralstonia mannitolilytica, and Agromyces sp. were
investigated in this study. On the other hand, I join several oral presentation sections. Those
include the major of the biological effect of nanohydroxyapatite materials and its toxicity by
professor Pang, Lead Contributed by the Environment and Raw Materials to Popular Street
Foods in Metro Manila, Philippines by professor Solidum, Heavy metal accumulation in
plants: A case study of Ipomoea reptans and Helianthus annuus. By professor Shahul Hamid,
and Inactivation of viruses in water by biogenic silver by professor Gusseme. Most of the
presenters gave a detail and comprehensive results in the presentation. Also, there were
most hot discussion during the conference processes.
After attended this conference, for us, it was worth to think for the environmental
protection and public health area of Taiwan, that is how do we need to improve our study
level and do more connection and interaction to the other countries. During the presentation
processes, there are so many graduate students from China, Japan, etc. They got very good
performance on their research and presentation. It indicates the other aspect that the
fundamentals research in these countries is also practical application. Specially, the
progresses of the environmental technology and molecular biology in China obtain great
improvement. Same conditions also happen in Sigapore, Korea, and Japan. People in
Taiwan need to think and work hard for the environmental biotechnology and public health
development. Besides, the statement ability of the environmental biology and public health
also need to emphasis in our country. The universitys in Taiwan also need to re-consider
how to improve and encourage the research of this related area.
4Janthinobacterium sp. An8 were predominant in all the treatment processes. The strain
Zoogloea oryzae(B11), Nitrosovibrio tenuis(N1) and Aquaspirillum sp. are all the
mainly strain which can cultured from the bacteria community. The strain Nitrosovibrio
tenuis can perform in aerobic and anoxic conditions of the wastewater treatment
processes.

Use these two proteins to be the preliminary outcome for designing the chicken anemia
vaccine to against the chicken anemia virus. The study succeeds to clone CAV viral
proteins VP1 and VP2. And predict use these two protein to be the antigen for
investigate the CAV vaccine. The results of this study have been in press to publish in
the international journal of “ProcessBiochemistry”.
(4)Conduct ozonation process to treat the wastewater from the scientific industrial park. The
experiment was investigated by detection the BOD5/COD ratio variation after the
ozonation treatment. The results shown that the BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.27 to
0.38. After 30 minutes ozonation, most of the COD components became biodegradable.
The COD molecular weight distribution demonstrate the 500 kD molecule obviously
decrease and the 2 kD molecule COD increase apparently. The results indicated that the
ozonation process can enhance the biodegradability of the organic pollutants from the
scientific industrial park.
(5)The study results of NSC proposal: An-Shun plant in Tainan city was product PCP at
1960s. The PCP and dioxin contamination in that site was found at 1990s. To prevent
the extent of pollution, the portion of soil in the plant area was storage, and the plant was
restrain for get into and announced a PCP and dioxin contamination site by Taiwan EPA.
Because PCP and dioxin have high stability and toxicity in the soil, the An-Shun plant
was still restrain for general use. In order to understand the stress environment of PCP
and dioxin contamination in An-Shun plant, We granted the research proposals in 2007
(NSC96-2221-E-131-018: The dynamic interaction impact study of soil microbial
community variation in bioremediation process with double pollutants-a simulation
study base on pentachlorophenol and dioxin contamination) and 2008
(NSC97-2221-E-131-014: The proteomics study of soil microbial community variation
and interaction in bioremediation process with double pollutants - a study based on
pentachlorophenol and dioxin contamination (Ⅰ)). These two studies dealing with the

biochemistry characteristics for the strains is now keeps conducting in our laboratory.
8ABSTRACT
The isolation and preliminary characterization of the indigenous dioxin-biotransformation
bacteria of Taiwan was conducted in this study. After that, the culture enrichment, and strains
acclimation were also carried out for the isolated bacteria. The soil samples, Tainan#1, Tainan#2
and Tainan#3 were gathering from the downstream of the announced dioxin contamination site in
southern part of Taiwan, and analyze PCDDs/PCDFs concentration to confirm the contamination of
the soil. According to the results, Tainan#3 has the highest total toxic equivalence about 2450ng-
TEQ/kg of the contaminants. After go through ten sub-culture inoculums, four bacteria strains
which can survive in dioxin media were isolated. The identification results shown these strains were
Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Ralstonia mannitolilytica, and Agromyces
sp.. The morphology of the strains revealed that all of the strains are gram’s negative. The
configuration of the strain presented that Ochrobactrum anthropi and Agromyces sp. obtain the
length and width of2μm and 1μm, which are bigger than others. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
Agromyces sp. is the closest with Mycobacterium chlorophenolicum strain PCP-1, which is a
PCP-degrading bacterium that with bootstrap value of 95.

2.The screening of the bacteria
The isolation of this study was conducted in this study by using the culture containing the minimal
salt base (MSB) and the 2.3.7.8. PCDD in the liquor culture. The 2 g soil was added to every culture
incubated in the stable environment of 30℃ and 150 rpm shaking. During the screen processes, the
facilitate carbon source succinate and glucose were also added to some of the specific culture to
enhance the growth of the microorganisms. The result of the screening included over 24 strains of
the bacteria in the pure culture. The culture of bacteria was then sent to identify the genus and
species after at least 10 folder of the sub-cultures. The result of the strains identification will be
shown as followed.
2. The identification of the isolated strains

(4) The phylogentic analysis
The analysis of the phylogentic relationship was shown on figure 2. From the present of the figure,
there was no closer consanguinity for these four strains isolated from this study. If compare the
phylogenetics one to one, the strain of Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Ralstonia mannitolilytica
had the closer consanguinity than the other strains. However, the bootstrap value of 37 was not high
enough to indicate the relation of these two strains. The strain Agromyces sp. obtains the closer
relation to the pentachlophenol degradation bacteria Mycobacterium chlorophenolicum strain PCP-1
with the Bootstrap value of 95. The strain Ochrobactrum anthropi obtains the closer genetic relation
to the genus of Sphingomonas species with the Bootstrap value of 95. The phylogenetics analysis of
these four strains indicated that the the strains in this study achieved the biodiversity since the
diversify of the genetics relations among these four strains.
