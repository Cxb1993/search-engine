1Abstract—A novel H.264/AVC fragile 
watermarking method is proposed which not only 
enables the authenticity and integrity of the video 
streams to be verified, but also yields a significant 
improvement in the compression ratio of the 
video streams. The effectiveness of the proposed 
scheme is demonstrated by way of experimental 
simulations. The results show that by embedding 
the watermark information in the last 
nonzero-quantized coefficient in each DCT block, 
the proposed scheme induces no more than a 
minor distortion of the video content. In addition, 
it is shown that the scheme not only detects 
unauthorized changes in the watermarked video 
content but also reduces the size of the 
watermarked H.264 file, and therefore reduces 
both its transmission time and its storage 
requirements.

1. INTRODUCTION 
  The widespread proliferation of digital video 
applications and the ready availability of ever 
more powerful duplication / manipulation tools 
have created an urgent need for sophisticated 
schemes capable of verifying the integrity of 
video streams upon receipt at the receiver end. 
The integrity and authenticity of multimedia 
content are generally verified using some form of 
fragile watermarking scheme [1-4]. Such schemes 
are capable not only of detecting any changes 
made to the original media, but also of locating the 
particular point in the watermarked media at which these 
changes have been made. 
 In general, traditional fragile watermarking 
schemes should satisfy the following criteria: 1) 
perceptual transparency, 2) a high sensitivity to 
tampering attacks, and 3) the ability to detect changes 
without requiring the original image.  Although many 
watermarking algorithms (both fragile and robust) have 
been proposed [5-10], the related researches focus 
principally on satisfying the three watermarking criteria 
outlined above, and general seldom discussed the size 
variation of the watermarked -media content due to 
watermark embedding. Generally, an important issue is 
to keep the variation of file size small as possible before 
and after compressed-domain watermarking. The reason 
is that a compressed-domain codec's output data should 
be constantly consumed in a constant bit-rate (CBR) 
channel. However, in this investigation we consider the 
variable bit rate (VBR) channel case to design a 
watermarking scheme that can further reduce the size of 
watermarked video stream after watermarking. In 
practice, keeping the bit-rate unchanged after 
watermarking is a very difficult problem for 
high-efficiency compression methods such as 
H.264/AVC [11-12] since the alteration of even just one 
bit can have a significant effect on the bit-rate or visual 
quality of the video content. For example, in the 
watermarking algorithm proposed by Wolfgang et al. [8], 
the bit-rate increased after the watermark information 
was embedded in the host content. Noorkami et al.[9] 
proposed a watermarking scheme for H.264-encoded 
video in which a human visual model based on 4×4   
discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks within each

The CWA scheme proposed in this study 
operates in the coefficient domain using the 
following 4×4 DCT transformations [11]: 
Y=AXAT                                                              
(1) 
Where X is a matrix of samples, Y is a matrix of 
DCT coefficients, and A is a 4×4 transform matrix 
represented as follows: 
A =
cbbc
aaaa
bccb
aaaa
                                                       
(2) 
where the elements of A are a =1 /2 , b

1 cos(π/ 8) , and c =
2
1 cos(3π/ 8). 
                        
CWA is designed to insert a watermark bit 
ϖ  at a specific location within each quantized 
DCT block q. The watermark embedding 
procedure commences by applying an adaptive 
selection strategy to determine the specific DCT 
coefficient in q at which to embed the watermark 
information. The adaptive selection strategy 
satisfies the requirements for size reduction, 
perceptual transparency and sensitivity to 
tampering attacks by specifically choosing the 
final non-zero coefficient in q (as identified in a 
zigzag scan) as the location at which to embed the 
watermark bitϖ .  Let ϕ  denote the selected 
DCT coefficient. In embedding the watermark, 
ϕ  is modulated to ϕ  in accordance with Eq. (3), 
resulting in a watermarked block, wq , i.e.

positive or negative, and ϕ  denotes the 
absolute value ofϕ . Furthermore, E (Λ ) = (Λ +1) 
mod 2 and Λ  is the number of odd value 
coefficients in q. As shown in Eq. (3), the number 
of encoded symbols is likely to reduce following 
the watermarking process since when the 
watermark bit is embedded in a block, there exists 
a finite possibility that the value of the final 
non-zero DCT coefficient will be modified to 
“0”ommission (IEC) [3].

        3. Proposed Watermarking Scheme 
 
Fragile watermarks are specifically designed to have 
a low resistance to malicious attacks such that the 
extracted watermark will be visibly damaged if the 
multimedia content is modified by a pirate or hacker. To 
demonstrate the video watermarking capabilities of CWA, 
this section discusses its application to the watermarking 
of standard H.264 format test videos.  
It is well-known that H.264/AVC improves the 
coding efficiency relative to that of the MPEG-2 standard 
whilst preserving an acceptable cost. H.264 encodes a 
video sequence into I-frames and P-frames and uses 
intra-prediction or inter-prediction technique to predict 
the current frame information in order to remove 
intra-frame and inter-frame redundancies. As described 
in Section 2, CWA embeds a fragile watermark into each 
quantized 4×4 DCT block and then passes the block to a 
variable length CAVLC encoder.  
Figure 2 illustrates the integration of the proposed 
CWA fragile watermarking algorithm with the H.264 
video encoder. As shown, in the encoding process, each 
macroblock of the current frame is predicted using either 
an intra prediction mode or an inter prediction mode. The 
difference between the current macroblock and the 
predicted macroblock is the residual. The residuals are 
then transformed, quantized, reordered, entropy coded 
and finally written to the bitstream. As shown in Fig. 2, 
the CWA watermarking scheme embeds watermark 
information into the quantized DCT blocks prior to the 
entropy coding process. Since the watermarking process 
simply involves modifying the last non-zero coefficient 
in each quantized DCT block, little change is required to 
the H.264 encoder structure, and thus the CWA scheme is 
implementationally straightforward.  
 
5DCT block such that the block contains an odd 
number of odd value coefficients. Thus, the 
watermark extraction process performed at the 
receiver end will fail to detect that the contents of 
the DCT block have been changed. As described 
above, the watermarked DCT blocks are fed back 
to the MD5 hash function as an input in order to 
form a new watermark bit for insertion in the 
following block-group. The output digest of the 
MD5 hash function is highly sensitive to even 
slight changes in the input. Thus, during the 
extraction process, the digest will vary widely if 
the contents of the watermarked block have been 
tampered with and the extracted watermark in the 
corresponding block will have the form of 
random noise. 
As shown in Fig. 2, each macroblock is 
processed using either an intra-prediction mode (I 
frame) or an inter-prediction mode (P frame) in 
the encoding stage. The resulting residual 
macroblock comprises 16 4×4 DCT blocks. As 
shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), CWA embeds four 
watermark bits within the four DCT blocks in 
each intra-frame residual macroblock and 16 
watermark bits within the 16 DCT blocks in each 
inter-frame residual macroblock. Since CWA 
embeds watermark bits in both the I-frame and 
the P-frame of the video stream during the 
H.264/AVC encoding phase, three specific 
watermarking procedures exist, namely Intra-MB 
mode, Inter-MB mode, and a combined mode (i.e. 
Intra-MB mode + Inter-MB mode). In the 
intra-MB mode watermarking, the watermark bits 
are embedded in the residual DCT-blocks in the 
intra-prediction coding procedure and form 
watermarked I-frames (see Fig. 4(a)). Similarly, 
as shown in Fig. 4(b), in the inter-MB mode 
watermarking, the watermark bits are embedded 
in the residual DCT-blocks in the inter-prediction 
coding procedure and form watermarked 
P-frames. Fig. 4(c) shows the intra-inter-MB 
mode watermarking combined from Intra-MB 
mode and Inter-MB mode.  
Figure 5 illustrates the insertion of a 
watermark bit into a residual quantized DCT 
block. As shown, the process commences by 
locating the last nonzero-coefficient, Hj,n, within 
the residual block. The watermarking scheme 
then counts the total number of odd coefficients, 
Oj,n, within the block and modulates Hj,n with the 
specified watermark bit, si,n, in order to produce 
the watermarked residual quantized DCT block. 
The watermark bit is modulated in accordance with

Where E (Oj,n) = (Oj,n+1) mod 2, sign(.) is a sign operator,

 The watermarked residual quantized DCT blocks 
are then entropy coded (see Fig. 2), CAVLC, forming a 
video stream to the receiver end.  Figure 6 presents a 
pictorial representation of a typical watermark 
embedding procedure. In this example, the final non-zero 
coefficient has a value of “1” and the block contains a 
total of 4 odd coefficients. In accordance with Eq. (4), if 
the specified watermark bit has a value of “1”, the value 
of the last non-zero coefficient in the residual block is 
modified to “0”; else its value is not changed.

In the decoding scheme described above, the value of 
each watermarked bit is determined simply by 
establishing the total number of odd coefficients in the 
reconstructed watermarked block. If the block contains 
an odd number of odd coefficients, the extracted 
watermark bit has a value of “1”; else it has a value of 
“0”. 
 
4. Experimental Results 
 
This section presents the results of a series of 
experimental simulations in which the performance of 
the proposed CWA watermarking scheme was evaluated 
in terms of three criteria, namely (1) its effect on the 
video quality, (2) the sensitivity of the watermark to 
various forms of attack, and (3) the compression rate 
improvement. The evaluation tests were performed using 
the standard video sequences “Mobile”, “Bus”, “Akiyo”, 
“Foreman”, “Tempete”, and “Stefan” and the 88 × 72 
binary watermark image shown in Fig. 8. The 
experimental parameters specified for the H.264/AVC 
codec are summarized in Table 1.

From mentioned above comparisons 
between inter-MB watermarking and intra-MB 
watermarking, we confirm that the intra-MB 
watermarking does not apply in the Intra frame for 
consideration of fragile watermarking due to its 
significant degradation. Conversely, the inter-MB 
watermarking is well applied in the prediction frame for 
consideration of fragile watermarking due to its good 
receivable quality. To meet the requirement for 
transparency and sensitivity to tampering attacks, the 
intra-MB watermarking scheme was modified to embed 
the watermark bit into the last non-zero coefficient of the 
last residual block in each residual macroblock. In other 
words, the watermark bit is embedded only in the last 
non-zero coefficient of the last residual block of one 4×4 
residual block in each residual macroblock rather than in 
the last non-zero coefficient of four residual 4x4 blocks. 
The modified intra-MB watermarking scheme was then 
combined with the inter-MB watermarking scheme to 
create a hybrid intra-inter-MB watermarking scheme for 
embedding the watermark bits into both the I-frames and 
the P-frames of the H.264 video stream. As a result, the 
intra-inter-MB watermarking scheme enables the 
integrity of the content of each frame within the 
sequence to be uniquely identified.  In addition, in the 
I-frame the number of watermark bits embedded in each 
residual macroblock is reduced from four to one, and 
thus a corresponding improvement in the visual quality 
of the watermarked video content is obtained. 
 
 
4.1.2 Video quality of intra-inter-MB 
watermarking scheme 
Figure 13 compares the frame-by-frame PSNR data of 
the original Bus video sequence with the PSNR results 
obtained when watermarking the two sequences using 
the intra-MB, inter-MB and intra-inter-MB schemes, 
respectively. It is clear that for both test sequences, the 
intra-inter-MB watermarking scheme results in a lower 
quality degradation than that induced by the intra-MB or 
inter-MB schemes. The average PSNR of the 
non-watermarked Bus sequence is 37.85 dB, whereas 
that of the intra-inter-MB watermarked sequence is 37.29 
dB; corresponding to a PSNR degradation of around 0.56 
dB. Figure 14 illustrates the variation of the PSNR with 
the QP for the original Stefan sequence and for 
watermarked Stefan sequences processed using the 
intra-MB scheme, inter-MB scheme and intra-inter-MB 
scheme, respectively. It is observed that the quality 
degradation induced by the intra-inter-MB watermarking 
scheme falls between that of the intra-MB scheme and 
the inter-MB scheme, respectively. Because 
intra-inter-MB watermarking scheme can embed the

z Noise attack 
To evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed 
watermarking to detect malicious attack, 
simulations were performed in which a 
watermarked video was manually modified by a 
hacker. That is, several random bytes of the 
watermarked video stream were tampered and the 
watermarks were then extracted. Figure 16 
presents a typical example of the watermark 
extracted from the “Tempete” video sequence 
following the byte attack. The results show that 
the proposed watermarking scheme is highly 
sensitive to even low levels of byte modification.

video contentExperimental Results 
 
   As described in Section 3, the watermark 
information is embedded in each 4 x 4 DCT block 
by modulating the value of the last non-zero 
coefficient in accordance with the value of the 
specified watermark bit. As illustrated in 
Appendix A, this strategy has the advantage of 
yielding a potential reduction in the number of 
bits within each CAVLC encoded block. In this 
study, the size reduction achieved by the proposed 
watermarking scheme is quantified using the 
following size reduction rate (SRR) metric:

where NS  and WS  are the file sizes of the

Fig. 17 Variation of SRR with QP for intra-inter_MB watermarking 
scheme 
 
Figure 17 illustrates the variation of the SSR with the 
QP for each of the six video sequences when processed 
using the intra-inter-MB watermarking scheme. The 
results clearly show that the proposed watermarking 
scheme achieves a reduction in the size of the 
watermarked file for virtually all values of the QP. In 
other words, the watermarking scheme not only provides 
a means of verifying the integrity of the transmitted 
video stream, but also provides a post-compression 
capability, and therefore reduces both the storage 
requirements and the transmission time of the encoded 
video content. Figures 18(a) and 18(b) present the 
variation of the SSR with the QP for the Foreman and 
Tempete video sequences, respectively, when processed 
using the intra-MB, inter-MB, and intra-inter-MB 
watermarking schemes. In Fig. 18(a), it is observed that 
for both the inter-MB and the intra-inter-MB schemes, 
the SSR increases rapidly with an increasing value of QP 
until a value of approximately QP=15, and then 
decreases sharply as the value of QP is increased further. 
Similarly, the SSR value for the intra-MB scheme 
increases with an increasing QP until a value of 
approximately QP=32, and then reduces rapidly at higher 
values of QP. Similar tendencies are observed for the

focused specifically on video streams encoded 
using the H.264/AVC standard, the proposed 
watermarking technique is equally applicable to 
multimedia content encoded in accordance with 
the MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 video 
standards. 
Although the simulation results have 
confirmed that the proposed watermarking 
scheme yields a reduction in the size of the 
watermarked field, the SSR is reduced at higher 
values of the control parameter (CP) due to the 
corresponding increase in the number of “all 
zero” coefficient blocks. Thus, in a future study, 
the proposed watermarking scheme will be 
extended to include a mechanism designed 
specifically to accomplish the watermarking of 
“all zero” blocks in a coding efficient manner.
