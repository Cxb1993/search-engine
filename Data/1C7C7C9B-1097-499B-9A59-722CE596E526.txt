where Yij denotes the Y-parameters of the two-port and R = 
Z1/Z2 is called the impedance ratio of the stepped-impedance 
line section. On the other hand, the Y-matrix of a straight λ/4-

It is known that ZT = Zo in the traditional 6λ/4-ring design, 
where Zo is the reference port impedance. Assume that the 
two designated operation frequencies are f1 and f2 = nf1. By 
enforcing the Yij entries in (1) and (2) identical to those of (3) 
at these two frequencies, four equations can be obtained as 
follows:

where y21(f1) = Im[Y21(f1) × Z1] and y21(nf1) = Im[Y21(nf1) × Z1]. 
Note that the sign of the shunt admittance B(f1) is not 
necessarily the same as that of B(nf1).  
If the impedance ratio R = 1, the solution to the above 
equations can be readily obtained and explicitly expressed as

When R ≠ 1, values of θ1 and θ2 can be obtained by enforcing 
(4) identical to (5). Provided n = 2.12 (for operation at 
5.2/2.45 GHz), Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) plot both y21(f1) and 
y21(nf1) curves against θ1 for various R values when θ2 = 5o 
and 10o, respectively. Both θ1 and θ2 are evaluated at f1. For 
each R, the intersection point of the y21(f1) and y21(nf1) curves 
gives the solution. The Z1 value can then be obtained by 
substituting the y21 solution into (4) or (5). 
Based on the solutions in Fig. 3, circuit miniaturization can 
be obtained simultaneously if R > 1 is chosen, since θ1 value 
decreases when R is increased. At the same time, however, y21 
= Z1/ZT also increases. By the standard microstrip process, 
there is an upper limit for realizable Z1. This means that the 
miniaturization cannot be arbitrary. For a microstrip line on a 
0.508-mm substrate with εr = 2.2, the upper limit of Z1 is 
about 150 Ω, so that the constraint on y21 is
