A Multi-Tool Integrated Methodology for Distributed Resource Allocation in Healthcare 
     1
1. Introduction 
Resource allocation assigns available resources to accomplish goals (various activities) within the 
framework of certain constraints and objectives. In general, we can express a resource allocation problem 
in a quadruple <R, A, X, O> where (1) R is the set of available resources: R = {R1, … Ri, …, Rm}, 1≤ i ≤ m,  
(2) A = {A1, … Aj, …An} is a set of activities competing for the resources in R, 1≤ j ≤ n, (3) X is m by n 
matrix where x i,j represents the amount of resource i allocated to activity j, and (4) O = u (X) - c (X) is the 
objective function, where u (X) is the revenue and c (X) represents cost associated with a given allocation of 
resources. For one kind of resource whose total amount is Ri (1≤ i ≤ m), we want to allocate it to n activities 
{A1,…Aj,…An} so that the objective function u (X) - c (X) is maximized. A simple structure of a resource 
allocation can take the form of a specific objective function with the sum total of available resources as the 
constraint. The amount of each resource to be allocated to each activity, xi,j, can be treated as a continuous 
or discrete variable which varies from case to case. Traditionally, research has focused on centralized 
resource allocation (Koopman, 1953). Ibaraki and Katoh (1988) and Katoh and Ibaraki (1988) provide a 
comprehensive review of centralized methods and algorithms in which the decisions are made based on the 
information collected from different entities with one global objective. However, the assumption that full 
knowledge is available to formulate and solve a centralized optimization problem may be too strict to real 
world applications. This is because allocating resources among a group of participants itself is a 
decentralized activity. Moreover, some information may be incomplete and error-prone which prohibits the 
formulation of a centralized problem. Over the last decade, research in the area of distributed artificial 
intelligence, studying how self-interested decision units (also called agents) can coordinate autonomously 
and effectively through an iterative compromising process to solve problems, has attracted more and more 
attention (Weiss, 1999). In 2005, Wu et al. review some distributed methods in this area. The methods 
studied include price-based negotiation (linear pricing and nonlinear pricing), compensation-based methods, 
and coalition formation-based methods. Wu et al. (2005) conclude that a price-based approach fits better 
than the other two approaches for large scale problems when available information is incomplete. These 
distribution methods have been applied successfully to production planning, supply network management, 
transportation, and computing. However, to our knowledge, application of the distribution method to 
healthcare has been less studied.  
Recently, a noteworthy research trend to study resource allocation for healthcare has emerged. This is 
probably due to rising healthcare expenditures as well as increasing demand for quality healthcare. Davis et 
al. (Davis et al., 2007) demonstrate a trend in U.S. healthcare expenditures in the last 25 years showing that 
the average U.S. healthcare cost per capita is higher than all other countries. In 2006, national healthcare 
expenditures in the U.S. reached $2.16 trillion, and are projected to reach $3.6 trillion in 2014, growing at 
an average annual rate of 7.1%. The growing population in the U.S., combined with continued medical 
advances, has increased the demand for quality healthcare services. With this growth, however, comes the 
challenge of managing rising costs and maintaining efficient operations. Recent research indicates that

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background literature as 
motivation for studying this problem. Section 3 presents the proposed framework followed by comparison 
experiments in Section 4. The conclusion and suggestions for future research are presented in Section 5. 
2. Literature Review 
Resource allocation is a method used to allocate limited resources among various activities so as to 
achieve a specific or given objective. As early as 1953, Koopman (1953) explicitly investigates resource 
allocation problems and shows how to construct a mathematical formula, and interprets the results for 
particular cases. Later on,  various methods, which are mainly centralized approaches, are developed in the 
area of Operations Research (OR) to consider objective functions (i.e., concave or convex), constraints (i.e., 
general linear constraints, lower bound, upper bound, etc.), and types of variables (i.e., continuous or 
discrete) for the purpose of dealing with resource allocation problems. Specifically in the area of healthcare 
resource allocation, efforts can be classified into two categories based on the OR techniques summarized in 
Table 1: (1) mathematical models including linear programming (LP), goal programming (GP), etc., and (2) 
simulation models.

As shown in Table 1, earlier research concentrates on goal programming (Lee, 1973; Keown and 
Martin, 1976; Wacht and Whitford, 1976; Trivedi, 1981; Tingley and Liebman, 1984; Chae et al., 1985; 
Kwak and Lee, 1997; Blake and Charter, 2002). This is driven by the multi-objective nature of resource 
allocation in healthcare. Linear programming, mainly DEA, has also been extensively studied to tackle 
resource allocation as a multiple criterion decision problem. Recently, various simulation models have been 
developed to conduct “what-if” analysis, which is a way to assess the efficiency of a hospital under a 
specific resource allocation setting. GP and LP approaches may suffer from a scalability shortfall that limits 
their applications to healthcare resource allocation. The size of a healthcare system, as opposed to one 
single hospital, means that GP/LP approaches may involve an overwhelming number of variables and 
constraints. Maintaining the model under such circumstances can be inordinately difficult and the 
computational burden can be heavy. Simulation models can be thorough but are time-consuming. In 
addition, the number of details needed to develop a suitable model can become cumbersome. Notable 
research efforts have focused on the applications of various methods (GP, LP, Simulation etc.) to the 
healthcare problem which is formulated in a centralized decision model. However, the decision problem 
itself has intrinsic distribution issues, that is, there is no central controller with all the necessary and 
complete information needed to formulate and solve a centralized optimization problem. Thus, centralized 
models are indeed inadequate for effective real-world resource allocation (Fan et al., 2003). Instead,

 Step 1 – Hospital Level: Each hospital employs crossover, mutation, and evaluation operations to 
generate new configurations (see section 3.1). The configuration information is exchanged between 
hospitals and headquarters. 
 Step 2 – Headquarters Level: Headquarters checks on the feasibility of the total request from all 
hospitals subject to budgetary constraints. 
 Step 3 – Headquarters Level:  Feasible requests are communicated back to each hospital.   
Step 4 – Hospital Level: A simulation is run for the requested configuration (see section 3.2) and 
DEA models are studied for the possible configurations (see section 3.3). The top performing configuration 
remains in the pool returning to step 1 and continuing the process until a converged solution is located or 
achieved. 
Figure 1 illustrates the communications between hospitals and headquarters based on the four steps 
explained above.

3.1 Configuration Generation 
Crossover and mutation are two basic operations of Genetic Algorithm (GA) used to generate 
configurations. The GA (Holland, 1975) is a stochastic search technique that is used on complex problems 
where traditional search techniques may be unsuitable. Solutions that perform poorly are stochastically 
eliminated and then replaced by splicing together pairs of surviving solutions or slightly altered surviving 
solutions. In this research, the main reason the crossover and mutation operations are applied is due to the 
computational concern. We set the number of configurations as the population size. Thus, instead of 
enumerating all possible configurations for further assessment, which in most cases is impossible, the 
evolution process will explore the configuration space gradually and converge to better solutions. Secondly, 
given a fixed number of configurations, simulation and DEA can be applied for efficiency study.

As shown in Figure 2a, when the patients walk into an ER, they are classified into two levels of cases 
at the triage station: some need to go through the acute care process (upper level), while others as well as 
patients coming to the ER by ambulance need to go through the critical care process. The patients are either 
discharged or admitted to other hospital units at the end of the ER treatment process. Figure 2b is an 
improved ER process which adds a fast track process.  
In the ER simulation model, the information regarding patients’ processing time is collected from a 
local hospital during the study. We first verify the collected data with that from the literature (Hall et al., 
2006; PR Newswire, 2006). For example, the overall patient waiting time from the simulation was within 
the range of 3.5 to 4.5 hours which is the same as reported by GAO. The model is also validated by 
simulation experts and ER staff. The patient arrival is assumed to be a Poisson distribution, the process 
time of lab tests is assumed to be a triangle distribution, and the other steps (diagnosis/processing by staff 
members) are all assumed to have exponential distributions. Note that we are looking at the peak arrival 
pattern which is the average patient arrival rate of the winter in this prototype study. Additionally, we 
assume the critical care process has higher priority to utilize the resource (i.e., staff members) than acute 
care, while maintaining a minimum number of staff reserved for acute care. Another note is that the 
simulation model does not include balking and reneging. The model run length is a day (1440 minutes) 
with 10 replications and includes no warm up time because we are interested in the pure transitive response 
condition instead of the steady state condition.  
Thus, for a given staffing configuration, that is, the number of RNs, LPNs, NPs and MDs, simulation is 
triggered to collect two performance measures: the average waiting time of admitted patients and average 
waiting time of discharged patients. The wait time here refers to the total actual wait time for all operations 
to take place, excluding the waiting for lab results while in the ER bed without any active treatment. The 
DEA model can then be developed treating the staffing configuration as inputs and the two performance 
measures as outputs.  
3.3 Efficiency Assessment 
DEA has been shown to be an effective tool for measuring efficiency in healthcare with applications 
dating back to the 1980s (Grosskopf and Valdmanis, 1987; Wilson and Jadlow, 1982; Nunamaker, 1983; 
Sherman, 1984; Register and Brunning, 1987). In a DEA model, the efficiency of an ER configuration 
(known as Decision Making Unit (DMU)) is defined as the ratio of the weighted sum of its outputs to the 
weighted sum of its inputs. The weights for each DMU are determined entirely from the output data of all 
DMUs in the peer group. For each DMU, the DEA method finds the most favorable set of weights, i.e., the 
set of weights that maximize the DMU’s efficiency rating under the constraint that the efficiencies of all 
DMUs are less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the weights used for each DMU are those that maximize the 
staffing configuration’s operational efficiency. There are various DEA models that have been developed to 
calculate efficiency. In the healthcare sector, the use of the variable returns to scale (VRS) measure (also 
known as BCC model which is named after Banker, Charnes, and Cooper in 1984) is recommended for

nonlinear price based negotiation method. A comparison index is then introduced to analyze the 
performance of the two approaches.  
4.1 MTIM Experiment 
4.1.1 Data and Model 
The flowcharts of the two ERs are shown in Figure 2.  We assume the two ERs have different patient 
arrival rates, but have the same distribution of station processing time in Table 2. Based on interviews of 
the two ER staffs, we set the configurations with RNs (1~20), LNPs (1~8), NP (1~5), and MDs (1~7).

First, each ER randomly proposes 121 different configurations (DMUs) as the initial population. Staff 
scale constraints are considered for the configurations. For example, the ratio between the doctors to the 
nurses should be less than 1:4. Next, roulette wheel (Goldberg, 1989), one of the traditional GA selection 
techniques is applied to randomly select two DMUs for crossover operation after which two newly 
generated configurations are introduced. The new configurations need to satisfy the staff scale constraints. 
If not, mutation operation can be implemented to modify the configuration. Each ER then triggers the 
simulation on the configurations (12 initial configurations and 2 newly generated configurations). The 
results are used in DEA models to assess the operation efficiency. In each iteration, efficient configurations 
of ERs will be sent to the headquarter to ensure the overall budget constraints are satisfied. For the cases 
                                                          
1 The number of DMU in DEA study has been suggested to be greater than m x s where m is the number of this inputs, 
and s is the number of outputs (Dyson et al., 1990). In this experiment, we have 4 inputs and 2 outputs.

discharged), the utility function ui(Xi) is fit by the regression function based on 5600 
( MDsNPsLPNsRNs 758205600 ×××= ) possible staffing configurations where X={x1,i x2,i x3,i x4,i} represents 
the number of RN, LPN, NP and MD for the ERi (i=1, 2). All four variables in the regression function (as 
resources) need to be considered because the P-values are significant (<0.05). Therefore, the linear 
regression is used to formulate the utility function because the adjusted R-square values (ER1: R2=0.52 and 
ER2: R2=0.85) are better than that of the quadratic models (ER1: adjusted R2=0.29 and ER2: adjusted 
R2=0.32). For simplicity, the utility function of ER simulation models only considers the treated patients 
who have healthcare insurance. Thus, the profit of an ER is directly related to the number of treated 
patients. Given the simulation data, the utility functions of the two ERs are: 
ER1: 7.84x11+1.1x21+4.7x31+9.42x41 
ER2: 10.4x12+0.01x22+12.4x32+16.7x42 
Thus, the price-based model of ERs in the bi-level structure is described as shown in Figure 5 below.

O> for healthcare resource allocation, we need to define  O = u (X) - c (X) to conduct further comparison 
analysis, where u (X) is the profit and c (X) represents cost associated with a given allocation of resources. 
Note that u (X) has two parts: one is the profit generated by treating the number of patients, which is the 
first term in Equation 4, and the other is the penalty imposed for the average patients’ waiting time, which 
is the second term in Equation 4. In this study, we assume the utility function u (X) is linearly related to the 
number of patients being treated. Cost function c (X) includes two components. The first component is 
derived from the salary information of staff and the expense of medical equipment. The second component 
is a penalty imposed on the hospital for the average patients’ waiting time. Thus, the objective function 
considers both budgetary issues and services to the patients.

A Multi-Tool Integrated Methodology for Distributed Resource Allocation in Healthcare 
     21
experimental results show that proposed methodologies can solve the problems of distributed resource 
allocation systems in the healthcare industry. 
Future work in this area can consider applying other techniques to improve the computation time. 
When an ER increases a new DMU between the iterations, DEA has to run p+1 linear programs. Also, it is 
interesting to find a reliable staffing configuration that is the best benchmark for a hospital during a year 
because the arrival distribution of patients changes tremendously from season to season in the real world. 
Thus, the demand of human resources is changes based on seasonal change. This benchmark can contribute 
to lower waste costs and higher efficiency performance as the seasons change.

ABSTRACT 
As in many other parts of the world, overcrowding in Taiwan’s hospital Emergency Departments (ED) is 
an increasingly scrutinized area. EDs in Taiwan hospitals must implement efficient systems that minimize 
costs while also providing satisfactory levels of care. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop 
and deploy a mixed method incorporating Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Data Envelopment 
Analysis (DEA) to evaluate potential bottlenecks, maximize throughput flows, and identify solutions in 
reducing patient time in the ED while also increasing patient satisfaction.   Hospital administrators can 
use the model data as a realistic reproduction to evaluate different scenarios and make modifications 
which best fit hospital operations.  This paper incorporates various types of ED resources as inputs 
including: number of physicians, number of nurses, and number of beds. We assessed the impact of 
changing levels of these inputs on ED operation efficiency, with optimal efficiency resource allocations 
as the goal. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Emergency Department crowding, a consequence of simultaneous increasing demand for health care and 
a deficit in available hospital beds and ED beds, has become an increasingly significant public health 
problem (Derlet 2002; Fatovich, Nagree, and Sprivulis 2005; Twanmnoh and Cunningham 2006; 
Ackermann et al. 1998). ED crowding has been associated with negative effects, including adverse patient 
outcomes (such as long wait times, reduced quality of care treatment delays, and increased numbers of 
patients who leave without being seen), as well as detrimental financial effects (Hoot and Aronsky 2008).  
Crowding is a problem in the US where one study found it occurs 12%-73% of the time (Weiss et al. 
2004) and it is also a global problem (Yoon, Steiner, and Reinhardt 2003). Significant overcrowding also 
exists in Taiwan (Shih et al. 1999); consequently, great efforts are being made by the administrators of 
EDs to consider patient satisfaction as a relevant factor (along with the medical treatment they receive) 
when addressing ED overcrowding.

gives an efficiency index which has been used in healthcare evaluation for the past three decades. Thus, 
we propose this mixed method for examining the issue. 
3 SIMULATION MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DATA COLLECTION 
An ED simulation model was developed involving a cooperative effort at a large teaching hospital 
research center in Taiwan over a year period. We developed the model with a preexisting data set, along 
with institutional information and expert clinician input. The ED department has a 53 non-trauma bed-
capacity in the ED, divided into three individual areas. Specifically, these are:  the Resuscitation Room 
(RM), with 8 beds reserved for critical care; the Main Emergency Department (MED), with 5 fixed beds 
and the Observation Unit (OU), with 40 assigned to the OU in the back of the ED. The RM treats patients 
needing to see a physician immediately, whereas the MED deals with less-severe conditions. OU patients 
stay for other treatments or lab tests after 6 hours of waiting. 
  During the study period, attending physicians staffed the main emergency department (MED) during 
different shifts. The staffing levels and available resources used in the model are summarized in Table 1. 
For example, two physicians (PHs), two PHs, and one PH staffed the ED-RR from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, 
4:00 PM to 12:00 AM, and 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM, respectively. The ED directs different proportions of 
patients to home, hospital, and the observation unit based on the patient dispatch distribution (Table 2). 
Thus, our research placed emphasis on three dispatch situations: discharge, admitted, and observed 
patients, and our goal was to find the mix of physicians, nurses, and beds to achieve efficiencies; that is, 
for each shift period, what number of PHs, nurses, and beds in the RR, TS, MED, and OU would 
maximize efficiency.

We used patient ED visit data from January 2009 to December 2009 as the benchmark figure, 
including 32,139 total ED visit codes with a mean of 89 visits per day. The patient arrival pattern over a 
24-h period in our study (Figure 1) is valid based on data collected from a study conducted at 163 
Canadian Hospitals (Oviatt and Hollingsworth 2005). The probability distribution of daily patient arrivals 
is fitted using an ARENA input analyzer. For the simulation model, patient arrival times during the 
seven-day study period were used to create an exponential distribution of patient interarrival time. 
Interarrival time is the time between consecutive patient arrivals. The exponential distribution is the 
standard distribution to use for fitting interarrival times. Thus, the time between consecutive occurrences 
of patients has assumed an exponential distribution.

medical crew is directly proportional to the quality of treatment. Shortage of human resources would lead 
to blood infections, the increase of rate of patients hospitalized and death. (Fridkin 1996) Khare (2009) 
mentioned that lack of sickbeds would delay the treatment of an emergency patient. McMillan (1986) 
referred that when the patient comes to the emergency department, regardless of which triage level is 
assigned, the patient and their family will feel anxious and pressing, wish to receive treatment 
immediately; if this expectation can not be achieved, unsatisfaction occurs and the quality of treatment is 
affected. 
2 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
In this study, our aim is to improve the flow of the ED by increasing the quality of treatment in ED. 
Waiting time, cycle time, emotion of doctors, management of doctors, and etc, indicates the quality. The 
following methods were used in this study. 
2.1 System Simulation  
Saunders et al. (1989) said the system simulation is an infinite potential tool to plan how to allocate the 
resources without changing the actual resources in the system. Kelton (1999) defined system simulation 
as a process to simulate the actual system by computer technology. Simulation can also be what the 
outputs may produce due to different allocations made under different conditions and to study the outputs 
to make a reference for improvement. Since the processes in an ED are very complicated, high costs 
would be incurred if every new resource allocation takes an actual test; so, system simulation is used.  
Due to the changing of number of doctors, nurses, sickbeds, and other variables, the waiting time, system 
time, and efficiency of the human resources can be obtained and then analyzed. 
The Opt Quest function in Simul8 is a Tabu search which is a macro-type heuristic algorithm for 
solving combinatorial optimization problems and not in the traditional local search escape local optimal 
solution using their own mechanism (Local Optimum) to achieve the best Solution (Global Optimum). It 
needs to generate a starting solution, according to a neighborhood of the initial solution generated by 
other nearby neighborhoods to find the best solution among the search of the initial solution as the next 
starting solution, and then generate a new neighborhood, and repeated until it reaches the stop searching 
criteria.  
2.2 National ED Overcrowding Study (NEDOCS) 
The crowdedness in the ED is being qualified over a few years, and NEDOCS and EDWIN (Emergency 
Department Work Index) are indicators to measure the crowdedness. NEDOCS is more commonly used   
by the medical industry. (Weiss 2004) NEDOCS is now used to measure the congestion in ED, using 
waiting time, amount of sickbeds, number of hospitalized patients, number of emergency patients and 
other parameters to analyze the factors via a regression equation.  The greater the value of this equation 
the greater the degree of congestion. 
3 MODEL DESCRIPTION 
This study is based on the situation at a medical center in Taiwan. The hospital currently employs 
approximately 2721 crews; there are 625 physicians (which includes 285 attending physicians), 1500 
sickbeds, 95,262 hospitalized patients annually, 1,517,745 outpatients annually, and 63,843 emergency 
patients annually. Thus, by analysis, there are 5320 times of emergency patients. 
This research applied system simulation to achieve an “actual: status of ED. The input parameters of 
this simulation are shown in the following: 
 
The distribution of patient arrival time  
1. The proportion of patient triage level 
2. The frequency of inspection of patients

 Resuscitation Room (RR): Patients with triage level of 1 from CR will receive treatment in RR. This 
area consist of 8 sickbeds, and every patient needs to be treated on sickbeds. Seriously injured 
patients will be sent to the operating room (OR); the operating time is Uniform (30, 50) (units: 
minutes). The ratio of patients needing an operation is 4.73:95.27. The processes in this department 
follow First In First Out (FIFO). Two physicians and two nurses are in charged in this area, while the 
data analysis cycle time and disposal is not discussed due to limited space. 
 Observing unit (OU): The flow of patients in this unit follow FIFO, and the two procedures treating 
and examining are repeating. Physicians will make an inspection patrol every 8 hours, and the time 
needed for patrolling is corresponding to the amount of patients, with each patient requiring 5 minutes. 
The maximum observation time is 48 hours; after that, patients will be informed the next treatment 
management. The proportion of different treatment management is not discussed herein due to limited 
space. 
 
The allocation of resources are distributed as follows: 
 
 Distribution of physicians: Assume that the abilities of every physicians are the same. 
 Distribution of nurses: Assume that the abilities of every nurse are the same. Allocate 1 nurse in triage 
area, 3 in MED, 2 in RR and 3 in OU. 
 Distribution of sickbeds: In this case, there exists a total of 60 sickbeds in ED, in which 52 are for 
emergency treatment and 8 are for first aid. If the amount of sickbeds available is zero, substitute 
wheelchairs as sickbeds. In this study, we assume that enough sickbeds are provided and patients 
cannot be hospitalized if sickbeds are insufficient.

In this study, we try to allocate 9 people as optimal allocation. The results obtained are shown in 
Table 5. It shows that shifting of 1 physician from OU to MED can reduce the NEDOCS value from 
97.63 to 88.73, which represents 9% of improvement.  The results from allocating 7 people are shown in 
Table 6

5 LIMITATION 
In this research, we assumed that: 
 
1. The qualifications, efficiency for every crews are equal 
2. Patients follow the queuing rules, arranged according to severity of disease and no 
unexpected events 
3. Departments are all independent operation 
4. Patients will not leave, even with long waiting times. 
5. ED stays in stable situation and won’t be affected by any other external factor 
6. Volunteers, interns and other uncertainties are not included in the study 
7. No problem on staff scheduling  
6 CONCLUSION 
In this study, our target is to improve the quality, flow in ED and the management of patients; we applied 
Simul8 to simulate the situation with 8 and 9 people in ED, and analyzed the results. The results showed 
that the allocation of human resources had obvious influence on the NEDOCS value and the degree of 
crowdedness with 8 people. Besides, we obtained a solution by Simulation Optimization, which is simpler 
in the actual situation. In the actual case, there are other factors which will affect the results; for example, 
the abilities of crews, interns having less experience than employed physicians, and other factors. The 
results of this study can be presented as a reference to the hospital management and the ED. In the future, 
this study can be enhanced by using more controlled variables to present a more reliable reference.
