Circuit Implementations  
Low Noise Amplifier Design:  
The TSMC 0.18-μm CMOS process offers polysilicon resistor, MIM capacitor, 
various spiral inductors, varactors, and six metallization layers. The topmost metal 
layer is with 2 μm metal thickness to implement the transmission lines and inductors. 
The substrate resistivity is 10-12 Ω/cm. The extended MOSFET model is based on the 
BSIMv3 SPICE model by adding parasitic elements to fit RF operations. The 
transistor with 30 fingers and total gate width of 75 μm is biased at 1 V of VDS and 4.5 
mA of IDS which exhibits a cut-off frequency fT of 50 GHz and a maximum oscillation 
frequency fmax of 80 GHz. Since octal inductor has greater Q than square one, an half 
and 1.5 turns’ octal inductors were chosen for the LNA. An optimized line width of 15 
μm for transmission line and inductor were chosen to minimize the conductor and 
substrate losses. All inductors and MIM capacitors were verified by full-wave EM 
simulator to consider the coupling effects from the layout geometries. Three-stage 
cascaded with common source topology is applied to obtain higher gain and reduces 
the noise from subsequent stages. The schematic diagram of LNA is shown in Fig. 1. 
Each transistor is with the same gate width. In the first stage, the inductive 
degeneration Ls1 is used to adjust the input impedance of M1 and provides the 
stability of the circuit. With the appropriate selection of Ls1, the input impedance for 
maximum gain and minimum noise figure are closer each other. The gate inductance 
Lg is used to shift optimum source impedance ZOPT to make LNA easily match to 
optimal NF. The series capacitor C1 acts as dc block and together with input 
capacitance Cgs to resonate out the series octal inductor Lg [5]. The MIM capacitors 
C5 and C6 with capacitances of 27 pF and 11 pF are used as on-chip bypass 
capacitors to suppress the supply noise. The pad with 60 μm × 60 μm in area is 
formed of the top metal six with metal one shielding layer. This pad parasitic 
capacitance of input and output ports is around 100 fF. The pad capacitance was also 
used as a matching element. The inter-stage matching network of each stage is 
constructed with a high-pass combination of L-C-L to achieve conjugate matching 
between two stages. These inductances are made of transmission lines. The inductors 
must be separated with at least 50 μm to reduce the unwanted coupling effects. Figure 
2 shows the die photo of the fabricated chip and the size is 0.8 × 0.57 mm2. 
 
Experimental Results:  
The chips were measured on-wafer using high frequency probes. The circuit was 
biased at total current of 16 mA from a 1.5 V power supply. The measured gain and 
return loss versus frequency is plotted in the Fig. 3. The small signal gain has a peak 
of 10.3 dB at 29 GHz with 3-dB bandwidth of 4.6 GHz from 27 to 31.6 GHz. The

60 dB and 40 dB as the LO frequency varies from 10 to 16 GHz. The measured 
LO-to-RF isolation also well agrees with the simulation and is better than 32 dB for 
the LO signal. Fig. 10 shows the measured output power of input power for the mixer 
at 28 GHz. The observed input 1-dB compression point is -2.7 dBm under the 13 dBm 
LO drive. Table II presents a summary of the mixer characteristics.  The simulated 
and measured results are matched very well. 
  A figure of merit (FOM) is the value of a fair presentation that represents the 
performance of a circuit. The FOM of mixer has been defined here is 
FOM=20log (fRF/ft) + CG – NF + IIP3 – 10log(PDC) 
where fRF is the RF frequency normalized to 1 Hz, CG is the conversion gain in dB, 
NF is the single-sideband noise figure in dB, IIP3 is the third-order input-referred 
intercept point in dBm, and PDC is the power consumption in mW normalized to 1mW. 
Here we particularly include another important parameter of ft to normalize the used 
process. All higher parameter values show better performances are accounted to the 
FOM. Therefore, a larger FOM would show an overall better performance of a mixer 
design. Table II compares the experimental results of Si-based mixer designs operated 
at millimeter-wave frequencies. The high performance sub-harmonic mixer discussed 
here is able to achieve a FOM up to 158, which is higher compared to the other 
previous works.  
 
CONCLUSIONS: 
The proposed sub-harmonic mixer has features of low conversion loss, small size, 
and a simple architecture for integrated millimeter-wave circuits. The LO signal is 
generated by a NP-MOS frequency doubler to provide an efficiently pumping to a 
single end mixer. The obtained FOM of 158 is the best result among the previous 
CMOS subharmonic mixer design at Ka band.

Input stage. (b) Output stage. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Topology of three-stage cascaded single-stage distributed amplifier 
impedance Zo,int can be boosted to increase the 
overall gain performance. In addition, by adding the 
number of cascaded stage, n, the overall gain of the 
CSSDA will be amplified. This is because the gate 
voltage of the interstage is increased, and 
substantially improves the available power gain of 
the amplifier. Compared with CDA, this is the most 
important advantage of the CSSDA.  
The small signal equivalent model of three-stage 
CSSDA is shown in Fig. 2. Besides the capacitors at 
gate and drain ports of the active device, the 
capacitor effects of the artificial transmission line 
are also took into consideration. The bandwidth of 
the amplifier is limited by the cutoff frequency of 
the artificial transmission line, i.e. the input and 
output capacitors of the pHEMT and the 
corresponding inductance of the artificial 
transmission lines. 
CSSDA uses the artificial transmission line in 
conjunction with the pHEMTs, which is composed 
of second order wide band low pass filters with two 
complex conjugate transmission poles. The transfer 
function is given by (1) [9],

and Zod is the external characteristic impedance

that Lg11=Lg12, Ri << 1/(ωCgs), Ld31=La, Cds,new=Ca

 from 26 to 65 GHz was shown in Fig. 5. Table I 
shows the features and performances of the 
previously published DAs compared with this work. 
As can be seen, the moderated gain bandwidth 
product (GBW) of 260 GHz is obtained which 
attributed the applied DC block capacitors to lead 
the roll off in low frequency range. However, in 
comparison the recent works, this circuit yields the 
best gain/area efficiency up to 12.05 dB/mm2.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
A compact three-stage CSSDA with a 16.5 dB 
gain over the frequency range from 26 GHz to 65 
GHz has been successfully designed and realized. 
The detail design formulas have also been derived. 
Compare with other GaAs-based broadband 
amplifiers and proof that the available gain of 
CSSDA can be boosted by increasing the Zo,int or the 
number of stages n. A 12.05 dB/mm2 gain/area 
efficiency is achieved which is the best record 
among the recent published V-band distributed 
amplifiers. These results show that this three-stage 
amplifier is adapted for optical communication 
systems.

the other tank of the oscillator to compensate total 
imaginary impedance of the network to zero. Thus, 
the circuit will finally oscillate on the desired 
fundamental frequency band. Fig. 3 depicted the

CPW push-push oscillator. 
 
B. Push-Push Circuit Design 
For push-push oscillator design, each sub-
circuit must satisfy the push-push mode conditions 
that suppression even mode oscillation and enhance 
odd mode oscillation. Fig. 4(a) gives the detailed 
schematic of the monolithic pHEMT Ka-band FG-
CPW push-push oscillator. Each sub-circuit is the 
same with topology as shown in Fig. 3, which 
oscillating at fundamental frequency (f0/2). The 
peripheral circuits TLOUT and COUT are designed to 
enhance odd mode oscillation such that its 
fundamental frequencies are added out of phase but 
second harmonics (f0) added in phase. Fig. 4(b) and 
Fig. 4(c) are the even mode and odd mode 
equivalent circuits of Fig. 4(a), respectively. 
Fig. 5(a) (b) are the simulations of even mode 
and odd mode sub-circuit oscillation condition. Fig. 
5(a) shows the even mode analysis, which indicates 
that the total real positive impedance exceeding 5 Ω 
is obtained; therefore even mode oscillation is 
quenched. Fig. 5(b) shows that the total real 
negative impedance is about -20 Ω at the 
fundamental oscillation frequency, thus odd mode 
oscillation is enhanced.

III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
The measurement results of the Ka-band FG- 
CPW push-push oscillator and its sub-circuit which 
operates at half oscillation frequency are shown in 
Fig. 6 ~ Fig. 9. These two chips were measured via 
on-wafer probing and the oscillation signal was 
monitored through the spectrum analyzer. Fig. 6 
shows the measured output spectrum of these 
fundamental and push-push oscillators. The 
oscillation frequency of the fundamental oscillator is 
14.75 GHz, and 30.3 GHz of the push-push 
oscillator. Due to the existence of peripheral circuits 
TLOUT and COUT, the oscillation frequency of the 
push-push oscillator is not exactly twice of the 
fundamental oscillator. The phase noise are 
measured from spectrum analyzer as shown in the 
log plot of Fig. 7, which indicates that the phase 
noise is -118.4 dBc/Hz for the fundamental 
oscillator, and is -113.2 dBc/Hz for the push-push 
oscillator at 1 MHz offset. This is the best result

IV. DISSCUSIONS &CONCLUSIONS  
A Ka-band push-push oscillator using FG-
CPW structure provides high Q value of the 
passive elements that exhibits the low phase noise 
performance. Table II is the benchmark of this chip, 
and the performance of phase noise at 1MHz offset 
is better than previous works which are 
fundamental topologies in the Ka-band. 
From Lesson’s model, the phase noise will be 
degraded by 6 dB if the oscillation frequency 
becomes double in the same oscillator topology. The 
topology of the sub-circuit of push-push oscillator is 
the same with the fundamental oscillator, so they 
can be compared under the same conditions. In Fig. 
7, the measured phase noise of push-push oscillator 
is higher than fundamental oscillator 5.2 dB, the 
push-push topology improves better phase noise 
than fundamental oscillator topologies. Due to the 
special DC bias schemes, this push-push oscillator 
core consumes lower DC power. So the circuit 
performs a good FOM of -188.16 dBc/Hz at 1MHz 
offset.

Fig. 2 Configuration of the CPW fed-line with SIR  
 
The tapered step impedance fed structure with Slotline ring 
resonator is shown in Fig. 2, Z1 and Z2 are the characteristic 
impedances of CPW line. The fed structure has two 
transmission zeros by varying the aspect ratio of the two 
impedances, i.e., K=Z2/Z1 which transforms 50 Ω input/output 
impedance to high impedance of Slotline ring. The gap controls 
the electric coupling coefficient of the Slotline ring resonator 
[4]. The optimized gap width is investigated by HFSS 3D EM 
simulator. Fig. 3 shows the return loss of the different coupling 
gap width G1 which is calculated in three dimensions of 0.18, 
0.2 and 0.3mm, respectively. As can be observed, for a narrow 
gap width obtains the better return loss since it increases the 
coupling capacitor [4].  In this design, a 0.2 mm gap width is 
chosen by tradeoff between the match condition and process 
limitation.

An anti-coupled lines structure of cascaded CPW ring 
resonator with shorted end is shown in Fig. 4(a). The short-end 
coupling mechanism is also evaluated by HFSS simulator. As 
shown in Fig. 4(b), the current flows in the metal surface 
around the short-end of the Slotline, and there is appreciable 
energy stored beyond the short-end, which gives rise to an 
inductive coupling to the neighbor Slotline resonator.

Since the coupling enhancement between the cascaded 
CPW/Slotline ring resonators in short-end, the wide band 
performance is then obtained. We utilize this cascaded ring 
resonator to realize a bandpass filter which is composed a 
CPW feedline structure and a Slotline resonator with short-end.  
The layout and equivalent circuit of the cascaded ring 
resonators are shown in Fig. 5, where λs/4 is the quarter 
wavelength of the Slotline, X1 is self-inductance and M1 is 
mutual inductance.

on the FR-4 PCB substrate. The filter is simulated by the HFSS 
software, which is based on an integral-equation and method-
of-moment algorithm. Fig.6. shows the simulated results for the
