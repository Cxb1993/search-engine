Abstract 
 A flexible planar monopole antenna is 
proposed for use in the radio frequency 
identification (RFID) tags at 5.8 GHz. The 
antenna was fabricated on an 13×15 mm2 thin 
laminate dielectric substrate and fed by using a 
coplanar waveguide (CPW) stripline to 
thereupon provide a low-profile and flexible 
antenna prototype for suitable use as a tag 
antenna. By embedding a folded slot into the 
proposed antenna, good radiation characteristics 
of about 480 MHz impedance bandwidth, 
monopole-like radiation patterns, and ≥ 5 dBi 
average antenna gain, for operating at 5.8 GHz 
can be obtained. In addition, the antenna 
performance for the proposed design with 
different curvatures are also examined and 
discussed.

1. Introduction 
     Recently, from security and control point of 
view, the radio frequency identification (RFID) 
systems have received much attention for use in 
efficiently tracking and identifying objects in the 
various supply chains such as logistics, 
automatic billing, access control and work 
tracking for factory automation, inventory 
management and bio-engineering applications. 
The RFID system basically consists of a 
read/write device and a tag, and data is 
transferred between the tag and the read/write 
device wirelessly by means of electromagnetic 
  4
ws=12 mm, sl =6 mm, fl =10.2 mm, wf=1 mm, 
and g=1 mm. 
In this design, the dimensions of the 
fabricated antenna were chosen to be of height 
13 mm and width 15 mm, and the length of the 
folded-strip arm (ws/2+ sl ) was found about 12 
mm, which are all very close to one quarter 
wavelength in free space at resonant frequency 
of 5.8 GHz (≅13 mm), and these indicate that the 
antenna can effectively excite a 5.8 GHz 
resonant mode. Moreover, to investigate the 
effects of curving the proposed antenna on 
radiation performance, the measured results for 
the proposed antenna design with a curvature 
angle of φ, which provides an appropriate radius 
of r according to the fixed patch width W  (i.e. 
W=rθ), are presented and discussed in more 
detail in the following section.  
 
3. Results and Discussions 
   The prototype of the proposed flexible CPW-
fed folded-slot antenna for 5.8 GHz RFID tag 
use as depicted in Figure 1 was constructed and 
tested. Figure 2 shows the measured frequency 
responses of return loss for the proposed design 
without curvature. For comparison, the 
frequency responses of return loss for the 
proposed antenna with two different curvatures 
of φ=95.5° and 143.2°, which result in an 
associated radius of 6 mm and 9 mm, 
respectively, have also been examined and 
plotted in Figure 2. For the case of the proposed 
antenna without curvature, as can be seen from 
the simulation, the antenna has a near resonance 
occurred at about 5.5 GHz. However, the 
measured results show that the resonant mode is 
excited at 5.73 GHz with -10 dB impedance 
bandwidth of 480 MHz, ranging from 5.45 to 
5.93 GHz and simultaneously suitable for 5.8 
GHz RFID and 5.8 GHz WLAN (5.725~5.825 
GHz) applications. As the antenna is curved, the 
resonant frequency is slightly moved. The larger 
the curvature angle, the higher the resonant 
frequency moves toward. Table 1 has 
summarized the measured results for the three 
cases including the proposed antenna design 
without curvature, θ=95.5° (r=9 mm), and 
θ=143.2° (r=6 mm). Obviously, the impedance 
bandwidth seems not  
affected from curving the antenna. 
Figure 3 plots the measured far-field radiation 
patterns including the co-polarization (Eθ) and 
cross-polarization (Eθ) in the E-planes (x-z and 
y-z planes) and H-plane (x-y plane) for the 
proposed antenna without and with two different 
curvatures at the appropriate resonant 
frequencies. Clearly, the nearly conical radiation 
patterns in the E-planes and almost 
omnidirectional pattern in the H-plane are 
observed, especially for the cases of without 
curvature and with a smaller curvature. The 
antenna in general shows a monopole-like 
pattern. In addition, we have also found that for 
the three cases discussed here, both the Eθ and 
Eφ components have comparable intensities in 
all three planes. These results occurred from the 
nearly equal length of the horizontal and vertical 
current paths, ws/2 and sl , respectively, of the 
inverted U-shaped antenna. However, this 
implies that the antenna is capable of receiving 
arbitrary polarization angles at a constant level. 
Such a characteristic can alleviate polarization 
loss and is an advantage for wireless 
communication applications, such as RFID 
application, where the wave propagation usually 
experiences multiple reflection effects due to the 
complex transmitting-receiving environment or 
the orientation resulting from the movement of 
the transmitting or the receiving systems. 
The antenna gains were also measured. The peak 
antenna gains for the proposed design with or

Dual-band CPW-fed G-shaped Monopole Antenna for 2.4/5 GHz
WLAN Application
Wen-Chung Liu and Chao-Ming Wu
National Formosa University, Taiwan
Abstract— A novel planar monopole antenna with dualband operation suitable for WLAN ap-
plication is presented in this paper. The antenna resembles as a “G” shape from combining two
folded strips and is fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line. By optimally select-
ing the antenna dimensions, dualband resonant modes with a much wider impedance matching
at the higher band can be produced. Prototypes of the obtained optimized design have been
constructed and tested. The measured results explore good dualband operation with −10 dB
impedance bandwidths of 9.7% and 62.8% at bands of 2.43 and 4.3GHz, respectively, which
cover the 2.4/5.2/5.8GHz WLAN operating bands, and show good agreement with the numer-
ical prediction. Good antenna performances such as radiation patterns and antenna gains over
the operating bands have also been observed.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recently, with the wireless communications, such as the wireless local area network (WLAN),
having evolved at astonishing rate, it has been well known that the future communication technology
pressingly demands integration of more than one communication system into a limited equipment
space. This indicates the future communication terminal antennas will not only be desired to be
low-profile lightweight, flush mounted, and single-feed but also need to meet the requirements of
dual- or multiband operation for sufficiently covering the possible operating bands. To comply with
this requirement, a compact planar high performance antenna with function of dual- or multiband
operation, and good radiation characteristics is therefore needed. However, the difficulty of antenna
design increases when the number of operating frequency bands increases. So far, many antenna
designs with enhanced dual- or multiband operation capabilities to satisfy the IEEE 802.11 WLAN
standards in the 2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz operating bands have been developed and presented [1–6]. Among
these antennas, the CPW-fed monopole antennas have especially received much more interest than
others owing to their potential in providing various required radiation features of dual- or multiband,
broad bandwidth, simple structure of a single metallic layer, and easy integration with system
circuit board. However, for the available CPW-fed antenna designs capable of dual- or multiband
operation for use in a WLAN system, as references of [4–6], some of them are with a complex
structure and some are large in antenna sizes.
In this study, we propose a CPW-fed G-shaped planar monopole antenna with optimal dualband
operation simultaneously suitable for use in the 2.4/5.2 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN)
applications. The geometry parameters of the proposed antenna, including the dimensions of the
G-shaped strip structure, the sizes of the coplanar ground planes, and the spaces between the
ground plane to either the G-shaped strips or the CPW feeding line, were all carefully selected
by using moment method code IE3D to achieve good dualband operation. Prototypes of the
obtained antenna for dualband operation were constructed and the predicted and measured antenna
performance such as input return loss, impedance bandwidths, radiation patterns, and gains are
presented and discussed.
2. DESIGN OF ANTENNA
Figure 1 shows the geometrical configuration of the proposed CPW-fed planar monopole antenna
for achieving dualband operation. The antenna is printed on only one side of an FR4 microwave
substrate with the substrate thickness of 1.6mm and the dielectric constant of 4.4. The main
structure of the proposed antenna comprises two folded strips, denoted as L1 and L2, respectively,
and a CPW feeding line. The strips L1 and L2 are both have a fixed strip width of s and are
folded to resemble the antenna in a “G” shape. For the smaller folded strip L1, it includes two
