Chitosan scaffolds as drug deliver carriers 
幾丁聚醣支架作為藥物輸送載體之應用 
 
Abstract  
In this study, we tested the performance of a chitosan porous scaffold as a drug delivery carrier. 
Chitosan (CS) and chitosan crosslinked with alginate (CS-ALG) were made into porous scaffolds 
and their physical properties related to controlled release and biocompatibility were measured. 
The CS-ALG had a sharper amide II peak based on the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) results 
and a lower thermo decomposition temperature compared to CS, confirming crosslinking took 
place. ALG/CS scaffold had smaller pores and more compact structure (SEM), lower swell ratio 
and bovine serum albumin release rate, and higher Young’s modulus compared to CS scaffolds. 
The ALG/CS material was more hydrophilic and provided better bone cell attachment than CS. 
This initial study suggests porous chitosan scaffolds can be made into drug delivery carriers and 
their release rates could be modified by crosslinking process. This finding provides basic but 
important information for tissue regeneration processes that require precise and slow release of 
medicine. 
 
Key words: Controlled release, drug delivery, chitosan, alginate, porous scaffolds, crosslinking.

nitrogen before test. Scaffolds (n=5 of ALG/CS and CS) were heated from 25℃ to 600℃ while 
weights of specimens were measured. Percentage of derivative weight loss was plotted verses 
temperature to find the maximum thermal decomposition temperature of each sample. 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) 
Films (n=5 of CS and ALG/CS) were placed in FTIR (Spectrum Gx, PerkinElmer, MA, USA) 
and scanned from 4000cm-1~400 cm-1. Absorbance peaks were identified in order to confirm 
crosslinking.  
Hydrophilicity (Contact angle) 
Five microliters of DI water was placed on each film (n=5) and contact angles were measured 
using a contact angle meter (CA-D, Kyowa Interface Science Co., Japan).  
Scaffold morphology (Scanning Electron microscope (SEM))  
Dried CS and ALG/CS scaffold specimens (n=3) were cut and sputter coated with Au before 
placed in the vacuum chamber of SEM (Hitachi S-3000H, Japan).  
Swell ratio 
After measuring average diameters (Do) of dry scaffolds (n=5 for CS and ALG/CS), the 
scaffolds were placed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH=7.4) and their diameters (Dt) were 
measured at each designated time point. Swell ratio at each time point was calculated as SR(%)= 
[(Dt-Do)/ Do]×100%.  
Loading and release rate of bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
Ten of each CS and ALG/CS scaffolds were placed in beakers filled with 100mL of 1% (w/v) 
BSA (Mo). At each designated time point, BSA concentration (Mt (mole/L)) in the solution was 
measured using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce, IL, USA). The amount of BSA loaded in the 
scaffolds was calculated based on the amount of BSA decrease in the solutions L(%)= 
[(Mo–Mt)/Mox100%]. Specimens were left in the BSA solution overnight to so they were 
saturated with BSA. The amount of BSA absorbed by each specimen (M24h) was calculated based 
on the final concentration BSA in the solution. Excess liquid was removed from scaffolds. Ten 
scaffolds were transferred a beaker filled with 100ml PBS (pH=7.4) and the amount of BSA 
released at designated time point was measured (Mt). The release rate was calculated as R (%)= 
[Mt/M24hx100%]. 
Degradation 
Four scaffolds (Wo) were placed in a 15mL centrifuge tube filled with 5mL lysozyme solution 
(70000U/mL PBS, pH=7.4). The tubes were placed in an incubator (37oC) and the lysozyme 
solution was changed every three days. On day 4, 7, and 10, three tubes of CS and ALG/CS were 
removed from the incubator and the remaining of the specimens were rinsed with DI water twice 
and air dried before their weights were measured (W). The percentage weight loss was calculated 
as [(Wo-W)/Wo]x100%.  
Compression 
Young’s modulus of scaffolds (n=4; diameter=7mm; height=9mm)) was determined by using 
a Universal Micro-tribometer (model UMT-2, CETR, CA, USA). Specimens were submerged in 
PBS overnight and excess liquid was removed before testing. The speed of crosshead was 
0.3mm/sec and a 10N load cell was used. The initial slope of the stress-strain (30% strain) curve

denser structure and smaller pores than CS. Scale bar = 500μm.  
Swell ratio 
Both CS and ALG/CS specimens reached their maximum swell ratio in approximately 20 
minutes (Figure 3). By the end of 60 minutes, CS specimens had a higher swell ratio (31.5 
percent) than ALG/CS specimens (26.4 percent) (p<0.01).

Figure 3. Swell ratios of CS and ALG/CS. Both reached their maximum swell ratios in less 
than 20 minutes. The CS specimens had an average swell ratio of 31.5 percent and ALG/CS 
specimens had 26.4 percent. 
Loading and release  
Loading efficiency of CS (42.1%) was about half of that of ALG/CS (23%) by 60 minutes 
(Figure 4A). Loading of BSA on chitosan scaffolds quickly rose and reached plateau in

Figure 5. Degradation rates of CS and CS/ALG. CS/ALG degraded at a slower rate than CS in 
lysozyme solution (p<0.01). 
Compression 
ALG/CS had a higher compressive Young’s modulus (3.55±0.44kPa) than CS (2.44±0.06kPa) 
(p<0.01).  
Osteoblast cell attachment  
Osteoblasts attached to ALG/CS films faster than to CS films (p<0.01) (Figure 6). Almost 
93% of osteoblasts were attached to ALG/CS by the end of the first hour, while less than 56% of 
them attached to CS.

DISCUSSION  
This project is the first attempt to quantify controlled release pattern of porous tissue 
engineering scaffolds made of chitosan. The chitosan scaffolds, after crosslinked with alginate, 
had a higher contact angle (hydrophilicity), a denser porous structure, a smaller swell ratio, and 
slower BSA loading and release rates. The crosslinked chitosan was less susceptible to lysozyme
