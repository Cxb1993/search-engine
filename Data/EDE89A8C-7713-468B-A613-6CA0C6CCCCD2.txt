used such systems to investigate the sensitivity of our biosensors. The liquid-gate electrode comprised a 
gold (Au) microwire (this inert metal was used to suppress electrochemical reactions between the 
solution and the electrode) inserted into a solution of known pH. The conductance measurements were 
performed using the lock-in technique at room temperature. A sine wave (47 Hz; amplitude, 10 mV) 
was applied to the drain electrode. The source electrode was connected virtually to the ground of the 
lock-in amplifier system. Figure 1(c) provides a schematic representation of the measurement setup for 
characterizing the conductance in the liquid-gating device. The measured conductance of the device 
increased upon increasing Vlg from 0.96 to 1.5 V in the pH-7.5 solution (Figure 2), indicating the typical 
electrical behavior of an n-type device in which electron carriers play the dominant role in current 
transport. The inset to Figure 2 presents the equivalent circuit of the measured conductance in the 
liquid-gating NW device system; competition between the inherent conductance of the poly-Si NWs 
and the ionic conductance of the leakage paths would govern the measured conductance of the NW 
device. The threshold voltage (Vth) of this device, extracted through linear extrapolation, was 1.23 V. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
To change the surface potential at the solution–SiO2 interface, and, thereby, to evaluate the 
sensitivity of the NW biosensor, we increased the degree of deprotonation of the silanol (SiOH) groups 
by varying the pH from a low to high value to increase the density of negatively charged groups 
(SiO–)[1, 16], as illustrated in Figure 3(a). We performed real-time conductance measurements to 
observe the change in conductance caused by the change in surface potential at the solution–SiO2 
interface upon increasing the pH from 7.5 to 8.5. Initially, we used a syringe pump to deliver the pH-7.5 
solution into direct contact with the NW. When the conductance of the device became electrically stable, 
the pH-7.5 solution was replaced by the corresponding pH-8.5 solution. We positioned an air bubble (ca. 
50 µl) intentionally between the two different solutions. As this bubble flowed across the surface of the 
NW, we observed in real-time that the electrical signal was disturbed, confirming that the change in 
solution pH occurred simultaneously with the change in the signal. We measured the conductance of the 
device under pH changes from 7.5 to 8.5 at various values of Vlg. Figure 3(b) presents the data 
normalized to ∆G/GpH-7.5 for comparison. The conductance of the n-type NW device decreased upon 
increasing the pH from 7.5 to 8.5; we attribute this behavior to the presence of additional negative 
charges at the SiO2 surface. According to previous reports[1, 5, 12, 17], the conductance of p-type NW 
devices will increase upon increasing the pH from low to high values—opposite to the trend we 
observed for our n-type system. Furthermore, the value of ∆G/GpH-7.5 of our NW device could be 
controlled electrically by varying the value of Vlg, as indicated in Figure 3(b). Figure 4 presents a 
semilogarithmic plot of the conductance of the device with respect to the value of Vlg in the pH-7.5 
solution. The subthreshold swing of this device was extracted to be as high as 132 mV/dec. Moreover, 
the measured conductance was weakly dependent on the value of Vlg when the device was operated in 
the low conductance regime, as indicated in Figure 4, suggesting that the ionic conductance of the 
leakage paths played a major role in the measured conductance. The magnitude of the ionic conductance 
contributed by the leakage paths in our NW device reached as high as ca. 4 × 10–9 S, as denoted in

Accordingly, gm/GpH-7.5 is proportional to the differential conductance change divided by the 
conductance, indicating that it can essentially be correlated to the sensitivity of the NW biosensor. 
Therefore, it suggests that we have developed a new methodology for optimizing the sensitivity of NW 
biosensors: by applying an appropriate value of Vlg that has been extracted from the gm/G curve. Note 
that the device-to-device variations in the threshold voltages and electrical performances of the 
electronic devices cannot be ignored when their feature sizes are decreased to the nano-scale, especially 
in the case of NW devices. Therefore, it remains highly unlikely that we could control all NW 
biosensors, fabricated using the same fabrication process flow, so that they operate with similar 
sensitivity performances when applying the same operational bias conditions. How we can optimize the 
sensitivity of NW biosensor prior to performing the biological measurements is, therefore, an important 
issue for the practical application of NW biosensors. Thus, we have demonstrated a method for 
evaluating the sensitivity of NW biosensors using solutions of various values of pH; this approach can 
be applied practically to the field of highly sensitive NW biosensors. 
To further investigate the dependence of the sensitivity on the value of Vlg in the NW device, as 
plotted in Figure 5, we divided the whole sensitivity into two stages. In the first stage, the sensitivity of 
the NW device decreased as the value of Vlg increased beyond 1.06 V. We attribute this behavior mainly 
to the potential coupling effect between all effective capacitances connected in series within the 
liquid-gating system. The inset to Figure 5 displays the equivalent capacitive model, comprising Cox and 
CNW, that we used to explore the correlation between the sensitivity of the NW biosensor and the 
capacitive coupling effect in the solution/NW system. The increased negative charge (–∆Q) due to 
deprotonation at the oxide surface is also labeled in the circuit. The coupling ratio (α) of the surface 
potential change in the NW to the liquid-gate voltage change, based on the capacitive model, can be 
given as

where ∆ψox and ∆ψNW are the surface potential changes at the solution–SiO2 interface and at the NW, 
respectively. When Vlg is swept from the subthreshold regime to the above-threshold regime, the 
increase in the electron carrier density of the n-type NW will result in an increase in CNW, which will 
play an increasingly important role in determining the value of α. As a result, the sensitivity of the NW 
device will decrease, due to the decrease in the coupling ratio, upon increasing the value of Vlg. 
Consequently, capacitive competition between CNW and Cox will govern the sensitivity of the NW 
biosensor in the high conductance regime, depending on the value of Vlg, in terms of the potential 
coupling ratio of ∆ψNW to ∆ψox. 
Notably, a significant drop in sensitivity occurred in the low conductance regime, which can be 
regarded as the second stage (Fig. 5), presumably because the inherent conductance of the NW was 
comparable with the ionic conductance of the leakage paths through the solutions (ca. 4 × 10–9 S in this 
study, as mentioned above). The measured conductance of the biosensor was contributed mainly by the
