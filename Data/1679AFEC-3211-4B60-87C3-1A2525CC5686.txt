摘要 
本報告總結此子計畫執行三年之研究成果，並提出未來之發展。有鑑於電子/機械網路
之不對稱關係，劍橋大學於 2001 提出慣質 (Inerter) 的觀念，並將其應用於汽車懸吊
系統之設計 [20]，以增進系統之性能。倫敦帝國理工大學延續這個觀念，將之應用於
摩托車之穩定控制 [3]。我們則於 2004 在台灣開始這項研究，延續筆者於劍橋大學開
創慣質研究之經驗，討論其系統性能及應用。在第一年我們首先進行第一代慣質模型 
(齒輪式慣質) 的製作，並探討其與汽車懸吊系統之應用；在第二年我們製作第二代慣
質模型 (螺桿式慣質)，並探討慣質非線性因素對系統之影響；在第三年我們著重於發
展第三代慣質模型 (液壓式慣質)，並進一步討論慣質於火車及建築物系統之應用。我
們並且建立一個實驗平台，驗証各種慣質模型之性能。 
 
關鍵詞: 慣質、機械網路、電子網路、汽車懸吊、火車懸吊、建築物隔震 
 
1. Introduction 
如眾所皆知，機械及電子網路系統之間存在著兩種對應關係，即”力-電壓”及”力-電
流”的對應。近代越來越多人使用”力-電流的對應關係，因為力和電流同樣被視為網路
元件中的穿越變數 (through variable) ，即在元件兩端的作用力 (電流) 是一樣的。”力-
電流”的對應關係如表 1 所示。然而由表 1 我們可以發現在這看似完美的對應關係中，
存在一個瑕疵，即機械系統中的質量 (mass) 並非完整的兩端點元件，必須有一端接
地。然而對應的電子網路系統 (電容) 卻是一個完整的兩端點元件。因為這一個不完美
的對稱關係，限制了被動式機械系統所能達到的性能。 
 
表 1.傳統機械/電子網路對應(“力-電流”對應) 
 
 
慣質的發明，即是針對這個不完美的對應關係所提出的一項解決方式。慣質和彈簧、
阻尼一樣，是一個兩端點元件。藉由此元件，可彌補原本機械/電子系統之間的不完美
對應關係。慣質之運動方程式表示如下： 
2
2
d x
dt
F b a b= ⋅ = ⋅
 
其中 F 為慣質兩端受力，b 為慣質係數 (Inertance) ，a 為兩端點間的相對加速度，x 為
兩端點的相對位移。由於慣質是一個兩端點元件，所以取代原來的質量 m 而形成一項
新的對應，如表 2 所示。 
 
有了慣質的觀念，所有被動式的網路阻抗 (impedance) 都可以用三種機械元件－彈
簧，阻尼及慣質－來實現。其好處是，我們可以使用完整的被動式阻抗來達到系統的最
佳性能。Smith and Wang 首先將慣質應用於汽車懸吊系統之設計[20]，使用彈簧，阻尼
及慣質的搭配探討其最佳設計；其結果顯示慣質可以增進系統之性能，而且不同的搭配
適合不同的性能要求。慣質的最佳化設計更被進一步的討論 [13]，使用 LMI (Linear 
Matrix Inequalities) 來達到性能的極限； LMI 得到的結果係使用 Bott-Duffin 方式來
作系統之實現。其結果顯示使用 LMI 可以讓慣質系統的性能得到更進一步的改善，其
2. Vehicle Suspension Systems 
汽車懸吊系統的設計已行之有年。一般來說，一個好的懸吊設計，應該在有限的避
震器運動空間內，達到以下的性能要求：(1)提供乘客舒適性；(2)提升車輛操作性能。
汽車在行駛中，懸吊控制所要處理的外界干擾主要有兩個，分別為路面顛簸及加諸車身
之作用力。略而言之，傳統的懸吊系統設計所要達到的目標，一方面是採用“軟式”懸
吊來隔絕路面的顛簸，另一方面則需採用“硬式”懸吊來隔絕車身作用力的干擾；因而
最終的懸吊設計，必須是在這兩個目標間採取的折衷設計。  
 
2.1 被動式懸吊控制 
傳統被動式懸吊系統採用彈簧、阻尼等被動式元件；從能量的觀點來看，這些元件
至可以儲存及消耗能量。雖然彈簧、阻尼可以有無限多種的組合，但絕大部分被動式懸
吊系統可以視作一組平行的彈簧、阻尼搭配(通常稱之為一個“柱”(strut))，所以傳統
懸吊系統可以視作在每個車輪與車體之間各有一個柱支撐。傳統懸吊系統還搭配一些額
外的元件及幾何設計，來改善局部的性能。前者常見的例子是抗轉彈簧 (anti-roll bar)
的使用以增加轉動的剛度，後者最常見的例子則為支撐桿 (trailing arms)的設計以改善
車輛加減速時的後座及前蹲現象 (anti-squat and anti-dive)。 
 
2.2 主動式懸吊控制 
一般依照其控制架構，可以再區分為半主動以及全主動式控制。前者是搭配被動式
元件，通常是利用彈簧支撐車身重量，而使用主動式驅動器來改善車輛性能從；後者則
是完全使用主動式驅動器來支撐車身重量及改善車輛性能。相較於被動式元件只能儲存
及消耗能量，主動式元件可以提供能量，因而主動式懸吊控制即是以額外的能量輸入來
改善車輛性能；尤其是全主動式懸吊控制因為使用驅動器來支撐車身重量，因此能量消
耗極大。因為能量的限制，使得目前只有極高價的車輛採用主動式控制。

在本計畫中，我們將慣質的概念引入汽車懸吊系統。利用慣質與傳統懸吊元件 (彈
簧、阻尼) 作各種方式的結合，從性能最佳化的比較，討論慣質所帶來的性能增益。本
計畫以五種不同的被動式懸吊系統來分析，包含傳統懸吊系統以及四種搭配慣質的新懸

在本節中我們將討論慣質對於汽車懸吊系統之性能增進。我們將分別就四分之一
車、二分之一車以及全車系統，使用前述的五種懸吊系統對四種性能指標作最佳化，以
顯示慣質系統的性能增益。

常出現的文字。

3.1.2 J3 (輪胎抓地力) 的分析 
 
J3 的分析結果如圖 3 所示，其表現與 J1 類似。性能提升以 S5 表現最佳；而 S2 雖然
性能提升較少，但所需的 bopt 與 copt也較小。另外，當彈簧的彈性係數 (Kst) 小於 75 kN/m
時，bopt=0，即此時 S2 等同於 S1。

以下針對四分之一車系統，參考現有的汽車懸吊系統參數[7]做為分析，觀察加入最
佳慣質之後，能提升其多少性能。這裡性能以四種不同的性能指標表示：ζ、J1、J3、J5。

J1 的分析結果如圖 8 所示，由圖可以發現 S2 和 S3 隨著 Kst 增加，越明顯優於 S1 的
表現，而 S2 又略優於 S3。隨著 Kst 增加，所需要的 copt 及 bopt愈大，特別是 S3 所需使

受路面訊號視為一時間延遲的關係。 
 
4. The Realizations of Inerter 
慣質元件可以依不同的機械方式來實現，目前發展出第三種方式分別為齒輪式慣質
(rack-and pinion inerter)、螺桿式慣質 (ball-screw inerter) 以及液壓式慣質 (hydraulic 
inerter)。本節將分別介紹這三種不同的實現方式。 
 
4.1 慣質雛型 
慣質的應用，包括了系統減振以及質量模擬。我們先根據慣質的原理，製作一個慣
質的雛型，如圖 12 所示。這一個慣質的原型，總重量不超過兩公斤，然而藉由齒輪組
的放大作用，在系統當中卻猶如加入一個 250 公斤的質量，因此對於抑制系統的震動非
常有幫助。 
 
 
圖 12. 台灣的第一個慣質模型 
 
4.2 第一代齒輪式慣質 (rack-and pinion inerter) 
 
仿照慣質雛型的原理，我們設計類似的齒輪式慣質機構如圖 13 所示，其工作原理
可以圖 14 說明，輸入力量於端點 1 齒條上，利用齒條與端點 2 外框架間的相對位移，
帶動齒輪組轉動，而齒輪組再帶動飛輪旋轉，將直線運動轉變為旋轉運動，達到能量轉
換之目的。 
 
4.3 第二代螺桿式慣質 (ball-screw inerter) 
雖然齒輪慣質設計方便，材料取得容易而且成本較低，但其缺點在於摩擦力較高
且齒輪與齒輪接觸間存在背隙問題，如果調整齒輪軸距，可減少背隙問題，但相對的卻
會造成摩擦力的增加。在齒輪高速轉換運動方向時，齒輪間的背隙將造成系統遲滯或相
位落後的問題，為解決此缺陷，因此有了第二種滾珠螺桿慣質的實現方式。 
滾珠螺桿在元件結構上的優點在於，其背隙較齒輪系統小，此外摩擦力也低於齒
輪組。圖 15 為滾珠螺桿慣質工作原理示意圖。由支撐座連接外套筒，固定滾珠螺桿於
端點 1，將力施加於螺帽上推動螺帽（端點 2），當螺帽向前行走時帶動螺桿旋轉，將直
線運動轉為旋轉運動，達到能量轉換之目的。 
 
 
圖 15. 滾珠螺桿慣質工作原理 
 
經力學方程式推導，可得理想滾珠螺桿慣質機構的力與位移關係式如下： 
22( )F I x b a
P
pi

其中 I 為飛輪轉動慣量與螺桿轉動慣量總和，P 為螺桿螺距（Pitch），x 為兩端點相對位
移量。圖 16 為我們在台大機械系工廠實際製作的滾珠螺桿慣質模型。

4.4 第三代液壓式慣質 (hydraulic inerter) 
前述的兩種慣質機構，都擁有整體質量輕、體積小、組裝便利的優點，較適合應
用於車輛避震系統上。然而，在一些減震系統應用中，欲提升減震系統的性能，勢必需
要很大的慣質係數 (譬如建築物減震)，換而言之，整個慣質機構就必須承受極大的負
載，考慮到滾珠螺桿（齒輪）的材料剛性，以及成本等問題，前述兩種機構設計對於建
築物減震之應用就顯得不適宜，因此我們思考了第三種慣質實現方法。 
第三種慣質機構設計是利用液壓設備的機械特性，來完成慣質的實現。液壓設備
常久以來就被應用於各個領域，在土木領域中，最常見的應用就是建築物的液流阻尼
器，擁有承受大噸位負載以及成本相對較低的優點，時至今日仍普遍應用於建築物的減
震設計上。我們所設計的液壓慣質機構，除了含有慣質之特性外，同時也包含了液壓阻
尼器的性質。 
液壓慣質是由液壓缸與液壓馬達所組成的封閉液壓系統，如圖 20 所示。液壓慣質
工作原理類似水力發電機，圖 21 為液壓慣質的簡化工作原理圖，液壓慣質兩端點分別
為液壓缸（端點 1）與液壓缸內活塞（端點 2），x 代表兩端點相對位移。 cA 代表液壓缸
內管截面積， pA 代表回流管截面積， iL 代表各段管線長度。當向右施予一推力於液壓
桿，此時液壓缸的活塞向右移，P2、P3 形成高壓區，P1、P4 為低壓區， 由於 P3 與
P4 間有一壓力差，此壓力差將帶動液壓馬達旋轉作功，液壓馬達出口流體再經回流管，
流回液壓缸中。反之當施力方向向左，液壓缸活塞與馬達朝反方向運動，其原理相同。
在液壓馬達出、入口處，分別裝設有數位壓力計，用以量測兩端壓力差。 iu 則代表流體
各質點之流速。 
 
5. The Nonlinear Properties of Inerter 
慣質是由各種不同的機械元件，加以實現而成的機構。然而在機械系統中含有許
多非線性因素，可能會造成真實機構與理想機構之間的性能落差，因此我們將考慮背
隙、彈性效應、摩擦力三種非線性因素對慣質機構的影響。 
 
5.1 背隙與彈性效應 
背隙是指兩齒輪由於在裝配上無法使用緊配合，所以在兩齒輪運轉時，會有兩齒輪
沒有互相接觸的情形發生。圖 22 為齒輪背隙模型。 
 
圖 22. 齒輪背隙模型 
假設齒輪間背隙角度為 2α， 1θ 為輸入轉角，並將齒輪軸視為由一彈簧與阻尼表示之
彈性體， 3θ 為背隙側軸轉角， 2θ 為被帶動齒輪所轉之角度。定義軸扭轉變型角度
1 3sθ θ θ= − ，背隙角度 3 2bθ θ θ= − ， 1 2dθ θ θ= − 。而作用於齒輪軸之力矩（T）可表示為

當右接觸時 ,  0b bθ α θ= = ，當左接觸時 ,  0b bθ α θ= − = 。因此兩齒輪間有無接觸之條件式
可表示為： 
          ( ) ,      ( ) 0

而滾珠螺桿上，在螺桿與螺帽也存在一類似齒輪間的背隙問題。圖 23 為滾珠螺桿背

6. Experimental Design and Results 
本節將介紹實驗設備以及實驗方式，並對第五節介紹之齒輪與滾珠螺桿慣質加以
測試，利用系統鑑別、遲滯曲線圖等方式來進行討論分析。 
 
6.1 實驗平台 
本試驗裝置之示意圖如圖 27 所示，所有裝備包含線性移動平台、馬達驅動系統、資
料擷取系統、試驗台與慣質避震器。本實驗使用的線性平台具有低摩擦高滑動之特性，
經由伺服馬達驅動滾珠螺桿，使運動平台做前後的直線運動，可操作之工作行程長度約
10 公分，最大輸出力約 1000 牛頓。整個線性移動平台固定於約兩百公斤的水平鋼板上，
以降低實驗操作時可能引起的震動。力量的量測採用 S-type 的 Load Cell，如圖 28，其
最大負載可量測 250Kg。而根據我們所使用的訊號擷取卡（NI PCI-6071E）規格，可進
一步計算最小解析為 0.16Kg，取樣率 1KHz。位移的量測，則利用光學尺作為量測來源，
已獲得馬達控制所需要的回受訊號，其精度為 1µm，如圖 29。

實際齒輪機構中我們必須考慮摩擦力、背隙、彈性係數等非線性因素，因此我們利用
5.3 節發展之數學模型，使用 MATLAB / Simulink 建立此模型，再經由系統最佳化處理
方法，求得各係數，並比較實驗值與理論值的結果。

6.4 滾珠螺桿慣質避震器實驗結果 
本節將討論滾珠螺桿慣質避震器之實驗結果，滾珠螺桿慣質避震器即是將滾珠螺
桿慣質結合彈簧與阻尼之避震系統。 
 
在滾珠螺桿慣質機構中，利用 4.3 節所述設計原理，我們設計了一油壓阻尼，並將
其視為一線性阻尼系統，本節將介紹如何量測此油壓阻尼之阻尼係數。 
如同前系統最佳化處理方法，我們可在數學模型中增加阻尼的影響效應，利用最小

桿慣質避震器於 2Hz 的時域響應結果。在實驗量測到力量結果部分，我們可以看到每
隔一定間距，會有類似脈衝的較大雜訊出現，此現象是由於 Load cell 的傳輸線，接受
到馬達一高頻雜訊所造成之影響。此外我們也可看到無論是實驗值或理論值的力量圖
形，在完整輸出波形上皆含有一較高頻的震盪，此小幅的高頻震盪主要是由於摩擦力此
非線性因素所引起，如在無摩擦力狀態下，則不會有高頻震盪。

圖 38. 滾珠螺桿避震器時域響應結果（2Hz） 
 
圖 39 為螺桿慣質避震器於 7 Hz 時時域響應結果。可發現實驗與理論值非常貼近，
由於此時所量測到輸出值很大，所以馬達的高頻雜訊與摩擦力的影響，皆不會呈現在圖
形上。 
 
圖 41 為滾珠螺桿慣質避震器於 1-6Hz 間的頻域響應圖。由於當頻率高於 6Hz 後，
系統表現全由慣質決定，再加上當高頻增益太大，不易觀察低頻時的結果。因此我們可
藉由圖 41 頻域響應結果來驗證，阻尼係數與估測值吻合。

其中最後一個等號是從 Paseval 理論得到。也就是說， 5J  可以被看作是 輸入能量對輸
出能量的最大比值。[13]. 所以我們首先從線性系統的分析得到其 infinity norm 發生的
頻率 0ω ，然後我們設定輸入訊號為 sin(  )sF A tω= , 其中對四分之一車我們採用 A = 1000 
N，而對二分之一車則採用 A = 2000 N。我們設定 0ω ω≈  並利用上式以找出最大的能
量比值。 
 
7.2 彈性效應 (the Elastic Effect)的影響 
為了討論彈性效應對於性能的影響，我們採用兩種不同的彈性設定: 第一是 ks = 
1000kN/m, cs = 3200Ns/m, 第二則是採用 ks = 2000kN/m, cs = 6400Ns/m. 從表 12 我們可
以發現僅考慮彈性效應的話，非線性的慣質就如同是一個理想慣質與彈簧/阻尼的串聯
結合，其最佳化的分析如圖 43 所示。

7.4 摩擦 (Friction)及彈性效應 (the Elastic Effect)的雙重影響 
同時考慮摩擦以及彈性效應對系統性能的影響，設定彈性係數 k = 120 kN/m，其最
佳化的結果整理於表 14，其中 cases 1, 2, 6 使用理想的慣質，cases 3, 7 代表使用彈性慣
質(ks = 1000kN/m, cs = 3200Ns/m)，cases 4, 8 使用具有摩擦力的慣質 (f=10 N)，cases 5, 9 
則是用同時具有摩擦以及彈性效應的慣質。對於 J1 而言，我們發現彈性效應比摩擦力
對系統性能的影響更明顯，而整體性能降低約 2-3%。對於 J3 而言，性能的影響幾乎
可以忽略，大約只有 0.5%。對於 J5 而言，彈性效應會使性能降低 (cases 3 and 7)，而
摩擦會稍微增加性能 (S3)。 
 
8. Applications of Inerter to Train and Building Systems 
慣質是一個新的機械元件，可以被應用在各個不同的機械系統當中以增加系統性
能，我們首先討論在火車懸吊系統以及建築物避震系統加入慣質之後的性能增進。 
 
8.1 慣質於火車懸吊系統之應用 
火車懸吊系統與汽車懸吊系統不同之處在於火車的車體以及車輪之間還有一個 
bogie 的構造，如圖 44 所示，我們可以針對 Q1 以及 Q2 進行懸吊設計。

行政院國家科學委員會補助專題研究計畫成果報告 
 
出席國際會議研究心得報告及發表論文報告 
 
一、 簡介 
 
這一次非常榮幸得到國科會的補助，能夠出席在北京舉行的複合醫學工程研
討 會 (2007 IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical 
Engineering-CME2007)。到了會場之後，才發現我們的文章是台灣唯一入選的
會議論文，因此除了感覺榮幸之外，亦深感背負著展現台灣學術水準以及風格
的壓力。藉這一個機會將參與這次會議的感想記錄下來，尤其是觀察到的大陸
與台灣在學術發展上面的優劣勢，在報告最後並且附上這一次發表的會議論
文。 
 
本次國科會計畫所發展出來的論文 (The Impact of Inerter Nonlinearities on 
Vehicle Suspension Control) 已經分別投稿到  IAVSD 20th Symposium: 
Dynamics of Vehicles on Roads and Tracks、CDC (the 46th IEEE Conference on 
Decision and Control) 以及 Vehicle System Dynamics (SCI Journal)，並且皆獲得
錄取，但是因為時間的關係，所以必須使用別的計畫的經費參與這一些會議。
而使用這一次國科會補助的會議出國經費參與 IEEE/ICME 2007，特此報告。 
 
二、 出席國際會議研究心得報告 
 
這一次北京理工大學爭取到主辦 IEEE/ICME 2007，除了展現大陸的經濟實
力發展迅速，更是他們在學術上想要進軍國際的各種動作之一。近年來參加各
個國際會議，發現大陸的出席者越來越多，而且他們也愈來愈有能力爭取到大
型國際會議到大陸主辦，使得台灣一向自豪學術國際化的程度遠勝於大陸的優
勢，正在逐年喪失，這一個此消彼長的驅勢，實在值得國內的學術領導單位特
別注意。 
 
IEEE/ICME 2007 於 23-27/May/2007 在北京舉行，大約收錄了 350 口頭報
告論文，主要的參與者還是來自大陸各地的學者，大約占了超過 80%，其次
是乃至日本的學者，大約有 10%，我們的文章是台灣唯一入選的會議論文，而
除了在大會晚宴的時候，李校長代表 IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 
Society 參加致詞之外，只有我一個台灣代表，因此言行都要格外注意，並且
趁機跟他們介紹台灣，增加彼此的了解。 
 
特別值得一提的是，在 22/May 早上完成報告程序之後，回到飯店房間，馬
上接到大陸其他大學的教授的電話邀約打麻將，可見大陸學術界雖然有物質方
 3 
3. 大陸目前還是一個貧富相當懸殊的社會，人民的素質良莠不齊，這是他
們發展的隱憂，也是歐美國家認為大陸不理性因素存在的原因之一。台
灣作為他們的鄰居，這一個不確定因素讓我們在與大陸的關係發展，必
須格外的注意。 
 
最後在離開北京的時候，在機場遇到詐騙的工作人員，呼應了之前對大陸人
民的感覺，也為這一次到大陸參與國際會議之行劃下一個完整的句點。 
 
三、 ECC 2007 
 
我們另外使用學校補助的經費參加 ECC (European Control Conference) 2007 研討會，發
表另外一項計畫－燃料電池的控制－的成果。在會議過程中，我們提出的新的控制理論
受到與會學者的關注，並且在會後紛紛與我們討論。值得一提的是，在會後恰好在雅典
碰到控制領域的大師- M. Vidyasagar，並且利用他在搭乘飛機之前半天的時間一同遊覽
雅典，建立私誼。希望將來能夠有機會邀請他來台灣訪問。 
  
 
四、 IAVSD 2007 
 
我們要另外使用了台大機械系補助的經費參與兩年一度的 IAVSD 20th Symposium: 
Dynamics of Vehicles on Roads and Tracks，發表本計畫所完成的論文。會議中與各國在
汽車動態研究領域頂尖的學者進行交流，並參觀了加州著名的 PATH 計畫重鎮。

influence of moving tracks on body loadings. The sit-to-stand 
movement is selected and analyzed, in order to illustrate how a 
special form of physical therapy known as the Alexander 
Technique can effectively reduce the loads placed on the joints. 
Because force and moment sensors cannot be implemented to take 
direct measurements within the joints, we used a motion analysis 
system to analyze information about body position and then input 
the data into ADAMS models to estimate the reaction forces and 
moments on the joints. Furthermore, an optimal control 
algorithm is introduced to quantitatively identify the optimal 
contours of the movements. By analyzing the reactions of the 
joints, this paper demonstrates that better moving tracks are 
beneficial for reducing body loads. 
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper adopts an engineering perspective to analyze the 
reaction forces and moments of the joints in order to identify 
ways to reduce body loads by improving moving tracks. Some 
special therapies, such as the Alexander Technique, attempt to 
optimize these body motions and suggest that our bodies 
should move in certain patterns to reduce physical stress. We 
will discuss whether good moving tracks are beneficial for 
reducing body loads. 
Early studies designed to analyze body movements used 
multiple-image photographs to collect data about body position 
[1]. As technologies developed, more sophisticated instruments, 
such as the motion analysis system used in this paper, were 
introduced to record body movement data. In [2], W. 
Mathiyahom et al. discussed the modifications of CoM (center 
of mass) trajectories during STS (sit-to-stand) tasks. Their 
results showed that the NJMs (net joint moments) on the knee 
and hip joints were significantly reduced by lowing the 
horizontal and vertical CoM displacements. In [3], Rodosky et 
al. studied the influence of chair height on STS tasks. They 
found that the maximum reaction moments on hip and knee 
joints were reduced when the chair height was shifted from 
65% KH (Knee Height) to 115% KH.  
Modern gait analysis is another powerful and non-invasive 
tool that has been used to calculate the mechanical factors 
involved in pathological processes, such as knee osteoarthritis 
(OA), cerebral palsy and total knee replacements. In [4], J.L. 
Astephen and K.J. Deluzio introduced a multidimensional gait 
data analysis technique to detect the discriminatory mechanical 
features of gait patterns for patients with knee OA. In [5], K.J. 
Bell et al. made use of motion analysis with a force plate, 
three-dimensional kinematics methods and dynamic 
electromyography (EMG) to observe the gait of children with 
cerebral palsy before and after surgery. In [6], L.S. Borden et al. 
utilized the Motion Analysis System and a force plate to collect 
body movement and force data, in order to analyze the gait 
cycle of patients with total knee replacements.  
In this paper, we establish a method to evaluate 
performance efficiency experienced during common 
movements performed using various moving tracks. The paper 
is arranged as follows: in Section II, the history and 
suggestions of Alexander Technique are briefly introduced. In 
Section III, the position data of the body is measured by a 
motion analysis system. In Section IV, ADAMS models are 
developed in order to calculate the joint reactions based on the 
measured data. In Section V, we introduce an optimal 
algorithm to identify the optimal moving contours for specific 
motions. Finally some conclusions will be drawn in Section VI. 
The results demonstrate that utilizing good moving tacks can 
help reduce body loads and increase work efficiency.  
II. ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE AND SUGGESTED MOVEMENTS
The Alexander Technique was developed in the 1890s by F. 
Matthias Alexander, who investigated body movements and 
devised a form of therapy known as the Alexander Technique 
[1]. The point of this technique was to retrain the movement of 
the body, and to provide a framework for people to recognize 
and rectify these improper habits. Based on this technique, the 
following recommendations are made for the sit-to-stand (STS) 
movement [7]: 
“To stand up, the legs should be placed hip-width 
apart. Make sure that the feet are flat and not placed 
so far forward that standing is difficult. The body 
should be led by the head.”  
To conduct the experimental work in this paper, a qualified 
Alexander Technique instructor assists the experiments by 
guiding the test subject to complete motions. The body loads 
before and after the training will then be compared. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS AND MEASUREMENTS
The experiments utilize a 3D motion analysis system 
and an AMTI force plate. This system was used to record 
the positions of markers attached to the body and the 
corresponding reaction force on the floor. The standard 
Helen Hays marker set [8], as shown in Figure 1, is used to 
mark the anatomical features.

To explicitly indicate the difference between the habitual 
and guided motions, Joint Power ( iP ) [9] is defined as follows: 
i i iP M ω= i ,                                       (1) 
where iM  and iω  represent the moment and relative angular 
velocity of the joints, respectively. When iP  is positive, the 
moment and the angular velocity are in the same direction, 
otherwise, they are in the opposite directions. As illustrated in 
Figure 4, the joint powers for both of the hip and knee joints 
were reduced in the guided motion. 
The efficiency of the motions is also investigated in this 
paper. Considering the 2D STS model, the change in potential 
energy is as follows: 
3
1
i i
i
V m gh
=
∆ =∑ ,                                 (2) 
where 1m , 2m  and 3m  are the masses of the leg, thigh and trunk, 
respectively and 
1h , 2h  and 3h  are the vertical change of CoM 
positions of the leg, thigh and trunk, respectively. Given the 
following parameters of 1m = 5.208 kg, 2m = 11.2 kg, 3m = 40 
kg, 
1h = 7.44 mm, 2h = 189.7 mm, and 3h = 300 mm, the net 
change of the potential energy is 139.8V∆ =  (N-m). The total 
work consumed to complete the motions is defined as follows: 
0

ft
it
i
U P dt
=
=∑∫ ,                               (3) 
where 1P , 2P  and 3P  are the joint powers of the ankle, knee and 
hip, respectively, and 0t  and ft  are the initial and the final time 
of the motion. The total work for the habitual motion was 
habitualU =207.2 (N-m). This value is reduced to guidedU =190.6 
(N-m) for the guided motion. The efficiency of the movement 
is defined as follows: 
V
e
U
∆
= .                                          (4) 
Note that the efficiency was increased from 67% to 73% by the 
guided motion, as illustrated in Table 2. 
Table 2. Energy analyses of the 2D STS motion.

Guided 139.8 (N-m) 190.6 (N-m) 73% 
To verify the accuracy of the ADAMS model, the force 
data from the force plate was compared with the reaction force 
on the floor calculated in ADAMS, as shown in Figure 5. 
When the hip leaves the seat, the body weight is supported by 
the feet. Therefore, the reaction force gradually increases and 
reaches a steady value when the motion is completed. 
Comparing the trajectories, the experimental and simulation 
data were relatively similar to each other. Minor differences 
could have been ascribed to the simplification and estimation 
inherent to the model.

Like the 2D STS model, the 3D STS model presented in 
Figure 2(b) was analyzed using ADAMS. The reaction 
moments on the joints are calculated by the measured position 
data and shown in Figure 6(a, b). This figure demonstrates that 
the guided movement was better than the habitual movement in 
terms of the maximum reaction moments. The comparison was 
further demonstrated by the joint powers, which are shown in 
Figure 6(c, d). The improvement associated with the guided 
motion was even more significant according to this data. The 
reactions of the left and the right sides are notably similar; 
therefore, only the right sides are given for illustration.

We next calculated the amount of energy consumed in 
order to quantify the improvement. The change in potential 
energy was first calculated as V∆ = 133.3 (N-m). Next, the 
total work expended by the habitual movement was calculated 
as habitualU =220.1 (N-m) and the total work expended by the 
guided movement was calculated as 
guidedU =201.2 (N-m). 
Therefore, by performing the guided motion rather, the 
efficiency was increased from 60.6% to 66.2%, as illustrated in 
Table 3.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper has proposed a method to evaluate the impact of 
moving contours on body loadings. In order to compare the 
habitual and guided motions, a qualified Alexander Technique 
instructor was invited to assist the experiments. The study was 
carried out in three phases. First, a motion analysis system with 
a force plate was utilized to record the moving tracks. Second, 
ADAMS models were developed to calculate the reactions on 
the joints, given the measured position data. Finally, an 
optimization algorithm was developed to quantitatively 
identify the optimal contours given the appropriate cost 
functions. From the comparison of the maximum loads, the 
joint powers and the working efficiencies, our results 
demonstrated that the guided motion was beneficial for 
reducing body loads. Furthermore, the results of the 
optimization were similar to the contours suggested by the 
Alexander Technique. Future research will likely extend these 
findings to more complicated models for use in rehabilitation.

 Abstract—This paper utilizes the system identification and 
robust control techniques for a Proton Exchange Membrane 
fuel-cell system. The dynamic behaviour of the fuel-cell system 
is influenced by many effects, such as the reaction mechanism, 
pressure, flow-rate, composition and temperature change, and 
is inherently non-linear and time-varying. However, from the 
system point of view, a fuel cell can be modeled as a two-input, 
two-output linear system with inputs of hydrogen and air flow 
rates, and outputs of cell voltage and current. And the 
un-modeled non-linear and time-varying characteristics of the 
system can be regarded as system uncertainties and 
disturbances that are treated by the designed robust controllers. 
This paper is comprised of three parts. First, system 
identification techniques were adopted to model the fuel-cell 
system. Secondly, a H∞ robust controller was designed to 
stabilize the system. Finally, the system stability and 
performance were compromised by introducing a weighting 
function to the controller design. From both the simulation and 
experimental results, the designed H∞ robust controllers were 
deemed effective. 
I. INTRODUCTION
N recent years, alternative energy resources gain more and 
more attention due to the greenhouse effects and 
decreasing levels of fossil fuel. Among them, the fuel cell 
is an important candidate to replace traditional fuel because 
of the advantageous features, such as functioning in low 
operation temperatures, quick power responses, high power 
density, no air pollution, and high system efficiency. Until 
recently, fuel cells have been applied to many systems, such 
as bikes, motorcycles, vehicles, and boats etc. As a result, the 
control of fuel cells to increase system efficiency and 
stability is becoming more and more important. The 
traditional methodology to control fuel-cell systems is

mainly based on classical control algorithms, such as PID 
controllers. However, these methods cannot fully satisfy the 
complex load change for many applications and may cause 
instability and performance problems. Therefore, more 
elegant control strategies, such as robust control, should be 
applied to improve the system performance. 
Rodatz et al. [1] presented a dynamic model of air supply 
and developed an LQG regulator for a Proton Exchange 
Membrane fuel-cell (PEMFC) system. From the results, 
performance improvements with the PI controller were noted. 
Moreover, the pressure trace was successfully decoupled 
from the mass flow trace, and a faster response time was 
achieved. Pukrushpan et al. [2] employed linear quadratic 
techniques to develop an observer-based feedback controller 
in order to protect the fuel-cell stack from oxygen starvation 
when the current commands were changed. Sedghisigarchi et 
al. [3] developed a H∞ controller to regulate the output 
voltage of the system under small load variations. From their 
simulations, the variation of the output voltage was less than 
5% by controlling the hydrogen flow rate. Caux et al. [4] 
aimed to control the air supply of a PEMFC system under 
varying current loads. In the simulations, a species balance 
model was proposed to maintain constant pressure on the 
cathode (oxygen) compartment and to follow a desired air 
flow-rate. Takeuchi et al. [5] emphasized the power 
management of fuel-cell systems interconnected with a utility 
grid, and succeeded in introducing typical topologies of 
fuel-cell based distributed generation systems. Jurado et al. 
[6] developed an adaptive controller for a fuel-cell 
micro-turbine hybrid power plant. Considering the 
time-varying dynamics of the plants and disturbances, the 
adaptive controller designed at a fixed operating point was 
applied to stabilize the system under different operating 
conditions. 
The fuel-cell system demonstrated in this paper was
designed and manufactured by CSIST (Chung Shan Institute 
of Science and Technology) and assembled by DELTA 
Electronics TM. The inputs of the system are hydrogen and air, 
while the outputs are cell voltage and current. Considering 
the nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of the system, 
robust control strategies were proposed to control the fuel 
cell in order to provide satisfied performance. This paper is 
arranged in the following sections. In Section II, the

system with loading of 4A is shown in Figure 3, and the 
resulting third-order transfer functions are illustrated in

III. ROBUST STABILITY DESIGN
In this section, robust control strategies are introduced. 
From the analyses of gap metrics and coprime factorisation, 
robust controllers are designed to provide the maximum 
stability bound for the fuel-cell system. The resulting 
controllers are then verified from both simulations and 
experiments. 
A. Principles of Robust Control 
Robust controllers can be designed for the identified 
linear models by using robust control strategies, such as 
Small Gain Theorem, perturbations of coprime factors, 
stability margin and gap metric [10]. A closed-loop system is 
said to be internally stable if all the system states are 
asymptotically stable, i.e., the states go to zero from all initial 
state conditions when the input signals are zero. For the 
discussion of internal stability, Small Gain Theorem is 
frequently used for robust controller design as follows: 
Theorem 1 (Small Gain Theorem) [10]:  
Suppose M RH
∞
∈  and let ͋>0. Then the interconnected 
system shown in Figure 5 is well- posed and internally stable 
for all ( )s RH

which gave the stability bound 0 3( , )b G K = 0.9131.  
It must be noted that the maximum gap between the 
nominal plant and the perturbed plants is 0.3403, which was 
less than the stability bound (0.9131), so that internal 
stability can be guaranteed for all systems perturbations by 
the designed controller 3K . 
C. Simulation and Experimental Results 
The designed controller 3K  was implemented to verify 
the effects from both the simulations and experiments. In the 
simulations, the plants were set to vary within the nine 
models in turns at intervals of 50 seconds. By using the step 
input (1V), the simulation results are revealed in Figures 7. It 
is shown that the designed H∞ robust controllers achieve 
internal stability for perturbed plants

Figure 7. The step responses of the perturbed systems. 
For the experiments, a closed-loop control system of the 
PEMFC system was developed by using the National 
Instrument’s (NI) Data Acquisition (DAQ) card and 
Simulink. This was accomplished by transferringthe control 
signal through the output port of the DAQ card and by 
measuring the voltage of the PEMFC system to the input port 
of the DAQ card. A step-down circuit was constructed to 
divide the measured fuel-cell voltage by 2 to protect the 
DAQ card since the allowable voltage range of the DAQ card 
is from -10V to +10V, while the maximum voltage of the 
PEM fuel-cell system is about 14V. The output responses of 
the closed-loop systems are shown in Figure 8,where the 
controller 3( )K s of (9) was implemented to control the 
fuel-cell system with different loading conditions when the 
reference voltage was set at 9.5V. First of all, it was noted 
that the closed-loop system remained stable under system 
variations. Secondly, the controlled voltage of the air-pump 
was 5~6V. Finally, the output voltage was approximately 
10~11V, while the reference (or desired) voltage was set at 
9.5V

From both the simulation and experimental results, it was 
shown that the closed-loop systems were stabilized by the 
designed robust controller 3K . However, we noticed that the 
system performance was not satisfactory in that the output 
voltage did not follow the reference signals. The reason is 
that the controller was designed to achieve the maximum 
stability bound, such that system performance was relatively 
ignored. For example, in the simulations, the reference 
voltage was set at 1V, but the steady-state of the output 
varied from 0.5V~1.7V, with the maximum overshoot of 
approximately 25V. Similarly, for the experiments the 
reference voltage was set at 9.5V, but the output voltage 
varied from 10V to 11V. Therefore, it is necessary to 
consider the overall performance criteria by adding 
weighting functions into the controller design. These issues 
are discussed in the following section
IV. ROBUST PERFORMANCE DESIGN
The controller design discussed in Section III focused on 
the stability of the closed-loop systems: That is, the design 
criterion was to discover the maximum stability bound to 
cope with system uncertainties. However, the system 
performance was relatively ignored, as shown in Figures 7 
and 8. Therefore, in this section, weighting functions are 
introduced to improve the system performance. It is shown 
from the results that the system performance is significantly 
improved by sacrificing a little stability bound 
A. Controller Design with Weighting Functions 
As illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, there were steady-state 
errors between the reference and the system outputs. 
Therefore, to track the reference command, an integral was 
added to the weighting functions. A weighting function

With the introduction of inerters, all passive network impedance (admittance) can be mechan-
ically realised by three mechanical elements – springs, dampers and inerters. Consequently, a
broader use of passive network impedance (admittance) is allowed to achieve better system per-
formance. The first successful application of the inerter was to vehicle suspension systems [19],
where several layouts of inerters, dampers and springs were optimised for various performance
criteria. It was concluded that some layouts are more suitable than others for particular perfor-
mance criterion. In [13], the optimisation was further carried out by using the Linear Matrix
Inequalities method, in which all passive transfer functions with fixed order were optimised for
various performance measurements. The resulting passive networks were then synthesised by
the Bott–Duffin realisation method. It was shown that the system performance can further be
improved by allowing higher-order passive impedance, with the drawback of very complicated
network synthesis. The second application of inerter was to the mechanical steering compen-
sator of high-performance motorcycles [3], where the inerter was used to replace a conventional
steering damper to stabilise the system in both the ‘wobble’ and ‘weave’ modes. The third inerter
application was to train suspension systems [25], in which the inerter was located in both the
body–bogie and bogie–wheel connections. Significant performance improvement was achieved,
especially when employing an inerter between the bogie and the wheel.
Inerters can be mechanically realised in various ways. Until now, two realisations of inerters
have been presented [13, 19, 25]. Due to the mechanical construction, some inerter nonlinearities
have been noticed [12, 14, 19]. In [19], the friction force and damping effect of inerters were
noted and used to simulate the frequency responses of a real inerter model. It was pointed out that
the experimental data matched better with the theoretical inerter by considering friction forces.
In [14], a model was proposed to take the backlash and elastic effect into consideration. The
parameters were then adjusted by comparing the time responses of the theoretical and practical
inerter models. In [12], a buffer network was placed in series with an inerter to remove the
nonlinear spiking of the force signals from the hydraulic testing rig. Through this arrangement,
the inerter device behaves as a damper around the crossover frequency and as an ideal inerter in
the intermediate frequency range, while at low frequencies it is dominated by friction.
In this paper, a nonlinear inerter model is proposed by considering three nonlinear properties,
namely the friction, backlash and elastic effect. Based on the model, we discuss the influence
of inerter nonlinearities on vehicle suspension systems. This paper is arranged as follows: in
Section 2, three basic suspension layouts are introduced to evaluate the performance of the quarter-
and half-car models. In Section 3, a nonlinear inerter model is proposed by considering three non-
linear properties. In Section 4, an experimental platform is built to verify the nonlinearities of a
ball-screw inerter model. The parameters of the nonlinear model can be tuned by comparing the
experimental and theoretical data. In Sections 5 and 6, nonlinear inerters are applied to vehicle sus-
pension analysis of the quarter- and half-car models. It is shown that the suspension performance is
slightly influenced by the inerter nonlinearities. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 7.
2. Vehicle suspension models
In this section, three basic suspension layouts are introduced to evaluate the performance of the
quarter- and half-car models.
2.1. Suspension models
Three kinds of basic suspension layouts, shown in Figure 1, are used for analyses. Among them,
S1 is the traditional suspension, while S2 and S3 are suspension models that employ ideal inerters.
It is noted that S2 is a basic parallel arrangement and S3 is a basic serial arrangement.

In equations (4)–(6), V represents the driving velocity, while κ is the road roughness parameter.
The parameters are set as V = 25 m/s and κ = 5 × 10−7 m3 cycle−1 for performance analyses.
It was shown in [19] that system performance can be improved by adopting inerters into the
suspension design. For example, setting the parameters of ms = 181.75 kg,mu = 25 kg, kt =
120 kN/m [2], J1 is improved by 13.75%(S2) and 18.74%(S3), and J3 is improved by 8.28%(S2)
and 16.26%(S3), while J5 is improved by 46.44%(S2) and 33.06%(S3) (Table 1). It is noted that
for J1 and J3, the achievable performance is better with the serial layout (S3), while for J5 it is
better with the parallel layout (S2).

3. Nonlinearities of inerters
As a mechanical network element, an inerter can be realised in various ways. Until now, two
types of inerters have been presented, namely the rack-pinion inerter [19] and the ball-screw
inerter [12, 25]. However, due to the mechanical construction, the nonlinearities of Inerter models
need to be considered [12, 14, 19]. In this section, three nonlinear properties of a ball-screw inerter,
including the backlash, elastic effect and friction, are discussed and a nonlinear inerter model is
proposed. Furthermore, a testing platform is introduced to experimentally verify the parameters
of the model.

If (xd(t0), x˙d(t0)) ∈ A− with xb(t0) = −ε (left contact), then xb(t1) = −ε for all times tq > t0
such that (xd(t), x˙d(t)) ∈ A− for all t ∈ [t0, t1].
• Assuming that xb(t0) = ε or xb(t0) = −ε and the trajectory (xd(t0), x˙d(t0)) reaches the release
set Ar, contact is lost at the first time t1 > t0.
3.2. Friction
Friction force exists in the contact surfaces. In order to reduce the friction, devices are often
lubricated to reduce the roughness of the contact surfaces. For the gear motion, friction happens
in the contact of the teeth. For the ball-screw, the contact between the nut and screw threads is
normally considered as rolling contact with a small friction coefficient [11]. However, for the
application of suspension systems, the friction force is not negligible because the normal force
on the contact surfaces is significant by preloading.
3.3. Inerter Model with nonlinear properties
Considering the aforementioned three nonlinearities, a nonlinear inerter model is proposed in
Figure 6b, where cs and ks represent the elastic effect, while ε is the backlash and f the friction
force.
4. Experimental design and results
In this section, a testing platform is established to verify the proposed nonlinear inerter model.
4.1. Testing platform
The testing platform is a motion table that is driven by a servo motor to control the displacement
of the suspension strut, as shown in Figure 7. The force of the device is measured by an S-type
load cell with the maximum load of 100 kg and resolution of 0.02 kg, while the displacement is
measured by a position encoder with an accuracy of 1 μm. Both the force and displacement signals
are transferred to a LabViewTM program to control the movement of the platform and recorded.
4.2. Theoretical model
Considering the nonlinear properties, the nonlinear inerter model of Figure 6b is implemented
in SimulinkTM. The simulation results are then compared with the experimental data to tune the

Figure 9. Parameter tuning of the nonlinear inerter model: (a) displacement, (b) force.
From the optimisation results, there is no backlash in the ball-screw inerter. The reason
is that the ball-screw set is normally preloaded to eliminate the backlash in the man-
ufacturing process [28]. For instance, four preloading methods, namely the double nut
preloading, spring preloaded double nut, offset preloading and oversized-ball preloading, are
described in [28].
4.4. Frequency-domain responses
To compare the frequency responses of the experimental and theoretical models, the time-domain
data is transformed into the frequency domain using the method illustrated in [Section 6.2, 9].
With parameter settings as follows: f = 10 N, ks = 1000 kN/m, cs = 3200 Ns/m, ε = 0 and
b = 113 kg, the frequency responses from the displacement input to the force output are shown in
Figure 10. It is illustrated that the theoretical and experimental gains match very well, with little
difference in the phase plot. From Figures 9 and 10, it is noted that the theoretical and practical
inerter models have similar time- and frequency-domain responses. Therefore, these parameter
settings will be used to discuss the impact of inerter nonlinearities on vehicle suspension design
in the next sections.

(b) J1 improvement (%), (c) optimal J3, (d) J3 improvement (%), (e) optimal J5, (f) J5 improvement (%).
5.2.1. Analysis methods
For linear systems, the performance measures can be evaluated by directly calculating the H2
and H∞ norms of the system transfer functions, as shown in Equations (4)–(6). But for nonlinear
systems, they can not be directly obtained because the transfer functions are time-varying and
depends on the input. For example, considering the backlash of the inerter, the transfer function
when it is in the range of backlash is different from the transfer function when it is in contact.
Besides, it is also noted that the performance depends on the input signal. For instance, when the
disturbance is large, the suspension displacement and the spring force are also large such that the
friction force is relatively negligible. Since there is no backlash in the ball-screw inerter from the
experimental results, the analysis will be focused on friction and the elastic effect.

Figure 12. Input signal zr for the expected-value method.
Input signal. For J1 and J3, the input signal is zr . Considering the spectral density Szr (f ) =
κV/f 2 [19], a time sequence
zr =
N∑
i=1
Ai sin(ωi t + θ) (17)
is generated to represent the input, where N is the number of frequency points. The magnitudes are
taken asAi = √(8πκV · 	ωi), in which	ωi = ωi+1 − ωi and	ωN = 	ωN−1, and the phase θ is
random such that the spectral density of zr is close to κV/f2. In the simulation, the frequency points
ωi are set between 0.1 and 1000 Hz with intervals of 0.1 Hz, i.e.ωi = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1000] Hz.
An input signal generated from Equation (17) is illustrated in Figure 12. To verify the accuracy
of this method, the performance indexes of the linear systems are evaluated by this method and
compared with the direct calculation of system norms. The results are shown to match with each
other. Therefore, the performance of nonlinear systems can be estimated by this method.
For J5, the input signal is Fs . First, the peak frequency ω0 where the infinity norm of the linear
system occurs is found.Then, for the nonlinear systems, the input signal is taken asFs = A sin(ωt),
in which we set A = 1000 N for the quarter-car model and A = 2000 N for the half-car model.
Then we search the nearby frequency by setting ω ≈ ω0 to simulate the output responses in order
to numerically find the maximum energy ratio by Equation (16).
5.2.2. Performance indexes by the approximated linear model method
In order to to illustrate the impact of friction on suspension performance, two settings are applied
to the inerter models. The first is f = 10 N from the experimental results of Section 4, and the
second is twice as big with f = 20 N. The optimisation of the performance measures is shown in
Figure 13.
For J1, the results are shown in Figure 13a and b, where the performance benefits are degraded
by friction, especially with larger friction.When the suspension stiffness k is small (k ≤ 15 kN/m),
the performance is even worse than the traditional suspension. But when k is large, although the
achievable performance is decreased by friction, the overall suspension performance with the
frictional inerter is still better than the traditional one (S1). For J3, the results are similar to J1,
i.e. the performance improvement is decreased by friction, as illustrated in Figure 13c, d. When k
is small, the performance of S2 and S3 is even worse than the traditional suspension (S1). For J5,
the results are shown in Figure 13e and f where larger friction implies more performance decreaseQ2

Table 1, where cases 1, 2, and 7 are with ideal inerters and cases 4, 5, 9 and 10 are with frictional
inerters. The expected values of J1, J3 and J5 are taken as the average of four simulations. For
accurate comparison, the expected values of the linear models (cases 1, 2 and 7) are compared
with the direct calculations of the system norms. It is shown that the errors are within 1%, so the
expected value is a reliable performance index.
For J1, when the friction is small (cases 4 and 9), it is noted that the performance varia-
tion is relatively negligible. But when the friction is large (cases 5 and 10), the performance
decrease is obvious. For J3, the influence of friction is similar. When the friction is small
(10 N), the influence on the performance is almost negligible. But when the friction is large
(100 N), the performance degrades ∼1% for S2 and 2.5% for S3 layouts. To numerically eval-
uate J5, the peak frequency at which the linear system achieves infinity norm is found. Then,
for the nonlinear systems, an input signal Fs = A sin(ωt) with 0 ω = ω0 is taken to simulate
the output responses in order to find the numerical optimisation for each case of Table 1. For
the linear systems (cases 1, 2 and 7), J5 is calculated from both the theoretical H∞ norm of
Equation (6) and the energy ratio of Equation (16) to illustrate the accuracy of this method. It
is shown that the performance is decreased by friction for the parallel arrangement and slightly
improved for the serial arrangement. The tendency is more obvious with larger friction settings
(cases 5 and 10).
5.3. Performance indexes by applying inerters with both friction and the elastic effect
Considering both friction and the elastic effect, a nonlinear inerter model of Figure 6b with the
following parameters will be used for analyses: ks = 1000 kN/m, cs = 3200 Ns/m, f = 10 N,
ε = 0, and c and b the same as the optimal suspensions settings obtained in section 5.1 (inerter
with the elastic effect only).
5.3.1. Performance indexes by the approximated linear model method
Using the first method, a nonlinear inerter is applied to the quarter-car model. From the simula-
tion responses, the system gains are obtained at specified frequencies and used to estimate the
performance indexes. The results are also compared with the norms of the linear systems. The
optimisation results are shown in Figure 14.
For J1, the optimisation using S2 and S3 are separately illustrated in Figure 14a and b. When
k is large, an inerter with only friction is better than an inerter with only the elastic effect. But
when k is smaller than 50 kN/m in S2 and 150 kN/m in S3, the result is contrary. And, an inerter
with both the elastic effect and friction is always the worst one.
For J3 analyses, the results are shown in Figure 14c and d, where the serial arrangement (S3)
is slightly different from the parallel arrangement (S2). For S2, when k is soft, the ideal inerter 15
is the best one, followed by the inerter with only the elastic effect, the inerter with friction only
and the inerter with both friction and the elastic effect. On the other hand, when k is stiffer than
140 kN/m, the ideal inerter is the best one, followed by the inerter with friction only, the inerter
with the elastic effect only, and the inerter with both friction and the elastic effect. But for S3,
when k is softer than 30 kN/m, the inerter with only the elastic effect is the best one, followed by
the inerter with both friction and the elastic effect, the ideal inerter and the inerter with friction
only. On the other hand, when k is stiffer than 230 kN/m, the ideal inerter is the best one, followed
by the inerter with friction, the inerter with the elastic effect and the inerter with both friction and
the elastic effect. That is, J3 is improved by the elastic effect for the serial arrangement (S3) when
k is soft.

5.3.2. Performance indexes by the expected-value method
Using the second method, an inerter with both friction (f = 10 N) and the elastic effect (ks =
1000 kN/m and cs = 3200 Ns/m) is applied to the quarter-car model. Similarly, those results are
compared with the norms of the linear systems to demonstrate the accuracy of this method. Setting
the suspension stiffness k = 120 kN/m, the impact of inerter nonlinearities on performance is
illustrated in Table 1, where cases 3 and 8 are suspension models with inerters applying the elastic
effect only, and cases 6 and 11 are the suspension models with inerters applying both friction and
the elastic effect.
For J1, it is shown that the performance is much more influenced by the elastic effect than
friction, and the overall performance is degraded by inerter nonlinearities by 2–3%. For J3, the
influence of inerter nonlinearities is less significant, with the overall degradation of ∼0.5%. For
J5, the performance is in general decreased by the elastic effect (cases 3 and 8), but slightly
improved by friction for the serial arrangement (S3).
6. Impact of inerter nonlinearities on the suspension design of a half-car model
Similar to the quarter-car model, the performance benefits of inerters for the half-car model
are investigated. Setting the suspension stiffness kf = kr = 120 kN/m, the influence of inerter
nonlinearities on suspension performance is illustrated in Tables 3 and 4. In the tables, the opti-
misation is carried out using several suspension layouts and settings. There are 13 cases in the
tables. Case 1 is the traditional suspension. Cases 2 and 8 are the parallel and serial arrange-
ments with an ideal inerter. Cases 3, 4, 9 and 10 are the suspension layouts applying inerters with
friction only. Cases 5, 6, 11 and 12 are the suspension layouts applying inerters with the elastic
effect only, with ks = 1000 kN/m and cs = 3200 Ns/m in cases 5 and 11, and ks = 2000 kN/m
and cs = 6400 Ns/m in cases 6 and 12. Cases 7 and 13 are the suspension layouts applying
inerters with both friction and the elastic effect, in which ks = 1000 kN/m, cs = 3200 Ns/m
and f = 10 N.
6.1. Approximated linear model method
Using the first method, the nonlinear inerters are implemented to the half-car model to evaluate
the performance indexes. The results are shown in Table 3, where the comparing friction force is
taken as f = 20 N in cases 4 and 10 in order to emphasise the influence of inerter friction.
For J1, the results are similar to the results of the quarter-car model. First, the performance
benefits of an inerter are decreased by both friction and the elastic effect. Second, from cases 2–4
and 8–10, the performance is degraded more by larger friction forces. Third, from cases 5, 6, 11
and 12, the performance is decreased more by softer elastic settings. Finally, the inerter with both
friction and the elastic effect is always the worst one.
ForJ3, it is noted that the performance is much more influenced by friction than the elastic effect.
With a slight increase in friction, the performance is significantly degraded. On the other hand,
the performance change is not much when the elastic effect is doubled. Finally, the performance
is the worst when considering both the nonlinearities.
The analyses of J5 suggest that the performance is significantly influenced for the S3 model
(cases 9–12), considering either friction or the elastic effect. On the other hand, for the S2 model,
the individual influence of inerter nonlinearities is not significant (cases 3–6). However, with both
friction and the elastic effect, the overall performance degradation is ∼8% for both the 17 S2 and
S3 models.

the performance (cases 5–6 and 11–12) at the stiffness setting kf = kr = 120 kN/m. The overall
performance degradation is <1% when considering both of the inerter nonlinearities.
For J5, the performance degradation is not obvious for the S2 arrangement (cases 2–7), but
reaches 6.5% for the S3 arrangement (case 13). Taking the nonlinearities individually, it is shown
that the influence is mainly caused by the elastic effect for S3 (cases 11–12), especially for the
soft settings.
7. Conclusions
This paper has discussed three nonlinear properties of inerters and proposed a nonlinear inerter
model. From the experimental results, it was shown that a ball-screw inerter has both friction
and the elastic effect. The nonlinear inerter was then applied to vehicle suspension design. The
individual and combined effects of inerter nonlinearities were discussed in three scenarios. Con-
sidering the nonlinearities, two analysis methods were proposed to investigate the performance
of the suspension systems. From the results, it was noted that the suspension performance was
influenced by inerter nonlinearities. In general, the performance benefits of inerters were degraded
by considering inerter nonlinearities, except for the S3 model where J3 was slightly improved by
the elastic effect when the suspension stiffness k was small. From the analyses, the performance
benefits were slightly degraded by inerter nonlinearities. However, it was illustrated that the over-
all suspension performance with a nonlinear inerter is still better than the traditional suspensions,
especially when the suspension stiffness k is large.
