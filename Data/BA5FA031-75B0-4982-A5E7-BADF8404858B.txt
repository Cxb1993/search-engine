2.2 Inverse Problem in DOT 
Owing to the non-linearity with respect to the optical properties, an analytic solution 
to the inverse problem in DOT is absent. Instead, the numerical way of obtaining the 
inverse solution is to iteratively minimize the difference between the measured 
diffusion photon density data, MΦ , around the tissue and the calculated model data, 
CΦ , from solving the forward problem with the current estimated optical properties. 
This data-model misfit difference is typically defined as follows,

where the goal is to reach MΦ  from the current CΦ .  As well, the vector ( )a∆μ  
and ( )∆κ  denote the updates respectively for aµ  and κ  with dimension NN  
(the number of total nodes in the finite element mesh) and, thus, the dimension of the 
matrices C a ∂ ∂ Φμ  or  
C ∂ ∂ Φκ  is M NN N× .  From Eq. (3), the inverse 
problem in DOT can be formulated as

matrix, i.e., the rate of change of model data with respect to optical parameters, and 
∆χ  means a

. It is worth to emphasize that Eq. (4) can be efficiently calculated 
using the adjoint method. 
However, solving this linearized inverse problem from Eq. (4) usually runs 
into difficulty with an ill-conditioned problem which typically happens as the number 
4 
 
∆χ . Therefore, the minimization of the proposed objective function is not an easy 
task because of non-linearity shown in Eq. (5). 
Introduced to simplify the minimization task is half-quadratic regularization, 
of which the principle is to bring in the auxiliary variable ( )1 2, , , l=b b b b , capable 
of making the first-order necessary condition linear in ∆χ  and then making the 
manipulation of the necessary condition  easier. After applying half-quadratic 
regularization, it is proven that the original objective function ( )EpQ ∆χ  can be 
written as the minimum of a dual energy, i.e., 
 *( ) inf ( , )Ep EpQ Q∆ = ∆bχχb  (7) 
where

Q λ ϕ∆ = ∆ −∆ + ∆ +∑∑χb JχΦb Dχb  (8) 
Note that Eq. (8) has the property that this dual energy is quadratic in ∆χ  when b  
is fixed.  As a result, the first order necessary condition is linear in ∆χ  when the 
auxiliary variable is fixed. 
Adopted for the reconstruction of the optical-property images by iteratively 
updating ∆χ , a strategy is to calculate the update vector ∆χ  based on minimization 
of this dual energy. First, n∆χ  is fixed at iteration step 1n +  and 1n+b  is simply 
computed using the expression obtained from minimization of * ( , )nEpQ ∆χb

where ijδ  is the distance between the node i  and the node j . Since triangular 
elements are considered in the 2D finite element forward solver of image 
reconstruction, six triangular finite elements can be regarded as a hexagon; i.e., there 
always have six neighboring nodes around an interior node and three different 
directions, here, are calculated for the first-order difference. 
3. Results and Discussions 結果與討論 
 Figure 1 presents image reconstructions for inclusions with different geometric 
sizes which are 6 mm, 10 mm, and 14 mm in diameter at the bottom right, the top, and 
the bottom left, respectively, and all of three inclusions are located at an off-center 
distance 20 mm. Apparently, Fig. 1 demonstrates a considerable contrast improvement 
in the reconstructed images when edge-preserving regularization was invoked, 
especially for the smallest inclusion at the bottom right region of the phantom (Fig. 
1(f)).  
 A two-layered phantom with an inclusion embedded inside the inner layer was 
used to evaluate the ability of edge-preserving regularization to resolve a more 
realistic structure in the simulation of breast imaging. The outer layer has optical 
property values of 0.006aµ =  mm
-1 and 0.6sµ′ =  mm
-1 and the inclusion with 
0.024aµ =  mm
-1 and 0.6sµ′ =  mm
-1 was placed inside the inner layer having the 
optical property values of 0.012aµ =  mm
-1 and 1.2sµ′ =  mm
-1. Reconstructed 
images for this two-layered domain case are shown in Fig. 2, in which iteration started 
from optical properties of the inner layer.  As compared with those using the 
Tikhonov reconstruction algorithm, shown as Figs. 2 (b) and (e), the reconstructed 
images were highly enhanced using the proposed edge-preserving reconstruction 
algorithm, shown as Figs. 2 (c) and (f), where two layers and the inclusion are 
identified without interaction.
