Abstract 
Process intensification is one of state-of-the-art technologies in green chemical process and becomes a 
very important trend in chemical process technology.  Internally heat-integrated distillation, externally 
heat-integrated distillation, and reactive distillation are successful examples of such process intensification.  
In this first-year study, the performance of internally and externally heat-integrated reactive distillation, a 
novel technology combining internally heat-integrated distillation, externally heat-integrated distillation, and 
reactive distillation, is investigated for three ideal reactive distillation processes with a reaction zone located 
at top, middle, and bottom, respectively, of a reactive distillation column.  The effect of exothermic reaction, 
endothermic reaction, different relative volatilities between components and different chemical equilibrium 
constants on TAC is examined for internally heat-integrated reactive distillation.  The optimal reactive 
distillation with external heat integration of condenser/reboiler type and rectifying zone/stripping zone type 
are also designed.  Simulation results demonstrate that internally and externally heat-integrated reactive 
distillation can provide better economic benefit than conventional reactive distillation.  Externally 
heat-integrated reactive distillation gives the least TAC for the reactive distillation process with separation 
column(s).

1. Introduction 
Heat pump principle is often adopted as an effective means of reusing rejected heat to improve the 
energy efficiency of a distillation column.  Internally heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC) used this 
heat pump concept to integrate heat between the rectifying and the stripping zones.  The rectifying zone is 
operated at a higher pressure than the stripping zone and a compressor and a throttling valve are installed to 
adjust the pressures.  The HIDiC was shown to give a substantial energy savings of around 30–50% in the 
separation of various mixtures when compared with the conventional column.1 
Regarding the external heat integration between two individual distillation columns, the most frequently 
employed schematic is the condenser/reboiler type configuration, where heat is transferred from the condenser 
of the high-pressure distillation column to the reboiler of the low-pressure distillation column.  The 
rectifying zone/stripping zone type of heat integration was also considered by Huang et al.2 and it can be 
In type IP, two products are the lightest and heaviest components while two reactants are LK and HK.  
The reaction zone is located in the middle of a RDC from a simple rule that the reaction zone is placed at 
where the reactants are most abundant.7  Huang et al.9 have shown that changes in the feed tray location can 
lead to substantial energy saving.  However, to independently identify the effect of internal heat integration 
on the TACs of a RDC and a HIRDC, in the study, two reactants are fed to the column by the same feed 
policy.  Figure 1a shows the nominal process flowsheet of type IP with stoichiometric design under the 
optimal condition with the minimum TAC.  Reactants A (LK) and B (HK) with a flow rate of 12.6 kmol/hr, 
respectively, are fed into a RDC operated at 9 bar.  Table 1 gives some costs of the conventional RDC under 
the optimal condition.

Figure 1. Configurations of (a) nominal column, (b) H-HIRDC, and (c) M-HIRDC with exothermic reaction 
for type Ip. 
In implementing internal heat integration for a HIRDC, the column is divided into a low-pressure section 
and a high-pressure section.  The vapor from the low-pressure section is pressurized by a compressor and 
entered into the high-pressure section.  With heat transfer from the high-pressure section into the 
low-pressure section, heat input from the reboiler and heat removal by the condenser can be reduced.  For 
the process of type IP, three configurations of HIRDC are designed, depending on the reaction zone located in 
the high-pressure section (H-HIRDC), in both the high- and low-pressure sections (M-HIRDC), or in the 
low-pressure section (L-HIRDC).  The number of trays for the high-pressure section and that for the 
low-pressure section are assumed to be the same in the study so that this annular structure can easily be 
constructed. 
Figure 1b shows the configuration of H-HIRDC where rectification and reaction zones are located in the 
high-pressure section while stripping zone in the low-pressure section.  The pressure of low-pressure section 
is set at 2 bar, the same value as that used by Lin10 in the conventional distillation columns for the processes 
of different types.  The number of trays in low-pressure section is equal to that in high-pressure section.  
Operating cost mainly from energy can be substantially reduced by making use of internal heat integration 
between the high-pressure and low-pressure sections.  A 22.9% reduction of TAC is obtained for H-HIRDC 
in comparison with RDC. 
Figure 1c shows the configuration of M-HIRDC where reaction zones are located in both the 
high-pressure section and the low-pressure section.  Reaction zones are equally distributed in high- and 
low-pressure sections.  Lower pressure in high-pressure section is designed for M-HIRDC than H-HIRDC.  
Energy consumption is substantially reduced by implementing the internal heat integration between the 
high-pressure and low-pressure sections.  A 32.8% reduction of TAC is obtained for M-HIRDC in 
 3
3.1 are also repeated in the design of RDC and HIRDCs with different configurations.  There is still no 
convergent solution for L-HIRDC under the constraints of product specifications.  Figure 3 shows the effect 
of relative volatility on capital cost, operating cost, and TAC for the optimal RDC, H-HIRDC, and M-HIRDC 
configurations.  Two HIRDCs need more capital cost than RDC.  Especially, capital cost of H-HIRDC 
increases sharply as the relative volatility decreases.  However, operating cost can be substantially reduced 
for HIRDCs by internal heat integration.  Higher sensitivity of operating cost to relative volatility is observed 
for the RDC with low relative volatility.  Saving of operating cost increases with decreasing relative 
volatility for two HIRDCs.  There is only little difference between the operating costs of H-HIRDC and 
M-HIRDC.

In the TAC comparison, two HIRDCs provide more economical design than RDC.  TACs of RDC and 
two HIRDCs decrease with increasing relative volatility.  M-HIRDC again provides the lowest TAC among 
these designs.  However, little difference of TACs between H-HIRDC and M-HIRDC is observed for relative 
volatility equal to 2.6.  These simulation results indicate that HIRDC provides more economical benefit than 
RDC for various relative volatilities.  The TAC difference between these two HIRDCs decreases with 
increasing relative volatility.

4.2 Design of externally heat-integrated reactive distillation 
To investigate the effect of external heat integration between RDC and separation column on TAC, the 
optimal configurations of condenser/reboiler type and rectifying zone/stripping zone type heat integration are 
designed and shown in Figure 6.  In the condenser/reboiler type heat integration, the pressure of RDC is 
raised and the temperature at the RDC top is sufficiently higher than that at the separation column bottom.  
The heat removed from the condenser of the RDC is used as the heat input to the base of the separation 
column.  Table 3 gives different costs for this configuration.  Operating cost is substantially reduced and a 
22.5% reduction of total TAC is obtained for this type of heat integration in comparison with the conventional 
reactive distillation process.  In the other type of heat integration, the pressure of RDC is also raised and the 
external heat integration is implemented between the rectifying zone of the RDC and the stripping zone of the 
separation column.  Only three heat exchangers are used in the configuration.  Table 5 also shows some 
costs and a 10.5% reduction of total TAC is obtained for this type of external heat integration in comparison 
with the conventional reactive distillation process.  From the results given in Tables 2 and 3, the 
 7
high-pressure section, for the process of type IR.  The energy consumption is substantially reduced by the 
implementing internal heat integration between the high- and low-pressure sections.  Some costs for the 
internally heat-integrated reactive distillation process can also be found in the Table 4.  A 45.2% reduction of 
TAC can be obtained for the H-HIRDC in comparison with the RDC. 
M-HIRDC is the other possible reactive distillation configuration with internal heat integration by 
extending the reaction zone from high-pressure section to the low-pressure one.  Simulation results indicate 
that M-HIRDC with one reaction tray in the low-pressure section has a little higher TAC than the H-HIRDC 
shown in Figure 7b.  The TAC of M-HIRDC increases with the number of reaction trays in the low-pressure 
section.  That is, H-HIRDC gives the most economical design among different configurations for the process 
of type IR.

 External heat integration is also implemented for the process of type IR.  In the condenser/reboiler type 
of heat integration, two configurations shown in Figures 8a and 8b are designed by removing the heat from 
the condenser of the RDC as the heat input to the base of the first and second separation columns, respectively.  
There are also two configurations for the rectifying zone/stripping zone type of heat integration.  External 
heat integration is implemented between the RDC and the first and the second separation columns, 
respectively, for the type of heat integration.  Table 5 gives the cost comparison of these four configurations 
for the process of type Ir with external heat integration.  Only small difference of total TAC is observed for 
these designs.  From the results given in Tables 4 and 5, the configurations with external heat integration can 
all give smaller total TAC than those with internal heat integration.  The process with condenser/reboiler 
type of heat integration between the RDC and the first separation column provides the most economical
