loss of information. This model is based on the concept of symbolic translation. It represents 
linguistic information by means of linguistic 2-tuples and defines a set of functions to 
facilitate computational processes over 2-tuples. 
  Another important shortcoming of conventional RPN methods is that the 3 parameters S, 
O, and D are evaluated according to discrete ordinal scales of measure. But, they are treated 
as if the numerical operations on them, most notably multiplication, are meaningful. The 
results are not only meaningless but in fact misleading (McCrum-Gardner, 2008). Therefore, 
this paper used the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) operator to resolve the problem of 
measurement scale. The concept of OWA operators was proposed by Yager (1988). It is a 
technique to get optimal weights of attributes based on the rank of these weighting vectors 
after processing aggregation. O’Hagan (1988) developed a procedure to generate OWA 
weights for given degree of orness α, to maximize entropy. Many related studies have been 
published in recent years. For example, Fuller and Majlender (2001) used Lagrange 
multipliers to derive a polynomial equation and then determine the optimal weighting vector 
by solving a constrained optimization problem. Chang et al. (2008) used intuitionistic fuzzy 
set and OWA operators to evaluate the system reliability of an aircraft propulsion system. 
  In order to effectively resolve the above mentioned RPN evaluation problem, this paper 
proposed a novel technique, combining 2-tuple and OWA operator for prioritization of 
failures in DFMEA. For verification of the proposed approach, a numerical example of a 
1.8-inch Color Super Twisted Nematic (CSTN) DFMEA is adopted in this paper. The result of 
the proposed method is compared with the conventional RPN and Linguistic Ordered 
Weighted Averaging (LOWA) operator methods.

2.1 OWA operators  
 
The concept of OWA operators was first introduced by Yager in 1988. It is an important 
aggregation operator within the class of weighted aggregation methods. The OWA operator 
has the ability to get optimal weights of the attributes based on the rank of these weighting 
vectors after an aggregation process (see Definition 1). 
Definition 1: An OWA operator of dimension n is a mapping : nF R R→ , which has an 
associated n weighting vector 1 2[ , , , ]TnW w w w= …  that has the properties

β , mh ,...,3,2= , and B  is the associated ordered label vector. Each element 
Bbi ∈  is the ith largest label in the collection a1, a2, ..., am. ⊗ and ⊕ are the product of a 
number by a label and the addition of 2 labels, respectively. mC  is the convex combination 
operator of m labels, and if m = 2, then it is defined as

where round(⋅) is the usual round operation, and jsb =1 , isb =2 . 
If 1=jw  and 0=iw  with ji ≠  i∀ , then the convex combination is defined as:

2.3 The 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation method  
 
    The 2-tuple linguistic variable is formed by combining the 2-tuple linguistic variable 
),( αis  (Herrea & Martinez, 2000), where the semantic element is  is assessed by the 
linguistic variable S defined in the linguistic term set },...,,{ 10 gsssS =  and ],0[ gi ∈ . 
Definition 2 (Delgado et al., 2002; Herrea & Martinez, 2000): Let β be the result of an 
aggregation of the indexes of a set of labels assessed in a linguistic term set S; i.e., the result 
of a symbolic aggregation operation. ],0[ g∈β , and g + 1 is the cardinality of S. Let i = 
round (β) and i−= βα  be 2 values such that ],0[ gi ∈  and )5.0,5.0[−∈α ; then α is 
called a symbolic translation. 
Definition 3 (Delgado et al., 2002; Herrea & Martinez, 2000): Let },...,,{ 10 gsssS =  be a 
linguistic term set and ],0[ g∈β  be a value representing the result of a symbolic 
aggregation operation; then, the 2-tuple that expresses the equivalent information to β is 
obtained with the following function: 
    )5.0,5.0[],0[: −×→∆ Sg                                         (9)

RPN value of 105 (S, O, and D are 5, 7 and 3, respectively). In this example, it is found that S 
is 5 in both scenarios 1 and 2. In scenario 1, the value of D is higher than scenario 2’s. In 
scenario 2, the value O is higher than scenario 1’s. For any decision-maker, he should give 
higher allocation resources to defend the most dangerous scenario. He would choose the 
highest value of 7 in scenario 2 as a higher priority. According to the conventional RPN 
method, scenario 1 (RPN = 120) is assumed to be more important than scenario 2 (RPN = 105) 
and is given a higher priority. However, in practice, scenario 2 is more important than 
scenario 1. 
 
3.2 The procedure of the proposed approach 
This paper proposes 7 steps in order to implement risk assessment on a 1.8-inch CSTN 
failure diagnosis. The following steps also are the basis of a model for combining the 2-tuple 
and the OWA operator approach for risk assessment. 
Step 1. List potential failure modes. 
Step 2. List potential effects of failure modes. 
Step 3. Define the scales for S, O, and D, respectively. 
Step 4. Calculate the OWA weights. 
Step 6. Rank the priority for assessing failure risk. 
Step 7. Analyze the results and provide suggestions. 
 
四、分析與比較 
 
This research uses a real case of a 1.8-inch-CSTN in order to demonstrate the procedure 
proposed in this paper. The CSTN has a lower cost than TFT LCD. It has major applications 
in mobile phones and MP3/MP4. The DFMEA of this CSTN is shown in Table 1.

thus, they have the same priority based on these 2 approaches. However, in practice, No. 5 is 
more serious than No. 4. In the proposed method, use the 2-tuple linguistic variable ),( αis  to 
represent the collective value of S. The No. 4 collective value is (5, -0.25) and the No. 5 
collective value is (5, 0.25) for S. The results show that the proposed method is without loss 
of information, which the experts provide to have valued information. 
Fourth: verify performance of the proposed method. In order to verify the performance 
of the proposed method, this research has gathered domain experts to check the results of the 
ranking orders of risk for failure. According to the domain experts, they indicate that this 
proposed method, which ranks the orders of risk for failure in the 1.8-inch CSTN, is 
reasonable in real-world situations. As a result, the stability of the product and process can be 
assured.

五、結果與討論 
 
This paper proposed a novel technique to assess the risk of the CSTN. It is useful when 
conducting DFMEA using 2-tuple and the OWA operator approach to assess the risk of 
potential failure modes. This approach provides a more flexible structure for combining 
severity, occurrence, and detection parameters. In order to further illustrate the proposed 
method and compare it with the listing techniques of RPN methods, a CSTN example is 
adopted. This study also compared the results with the conventional RPN (Ford Motor 
Company, 1988) and LOWA (Delgado et al., 2002; Yager, 1988) methods. The results showed
