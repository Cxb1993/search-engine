closed-form solution for the field can be found. This is different from the Rayleigh-Ritz method in 
which two-dimensional cosine series expansions were needed [16]. In the following, one can find that 
the proposed method provides much better accuracy in determining the modal index than these 
aforementioned semi-analytic methods. In some examples presented below, we will show the 
efficiency of the proposed method. In Section two, the theory of the proposed matrix method is 
outlined for the case of quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes. The computational results are presented in 
Section three, where one can see the accuracy and efficiency the method provides. Finally, Section 
four concludes this paper.    
 
 
                           
2. Theory 
     The geometric structure of the optical rib waveguide considered in this study is shown in Fig.1, 
where the width and height of the rib are denoted by w and h, respectively, and the thickness of the 
slab is represented by d. The refractive indices of the guiding region, substrate and cover in the 
structure are 1n , 2n  and 3n , respectively. Only quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes are discussed in 
this study.

that one period extends from - x3 to x3  and each period includes two images of a rib waveguide.  
In this case all fields (including symmetric and anti-symmetric modes ) are expanded in 
cosine series.

where det{.} represents the determinant of a matrix. The equation in (17) is thus used to determine the 
modal index (which is equal to 0/ kβ ). A Newton-Raphson algorithm [17] is quite efficient in solving 
Eq. (17) and is used in this study. Once β is found, all the vectors 1H , 2H , 3H  and 4H  (see Eq.

to be arbitrary) appearing in Eq.(12) can be determined by using the boundary conditions stated in

BeamPROP and the proposed method with the same PC. 
Table 2 shows the effective index effn  calculated by the proposed method, the commercial 
software BeamPROP and the method of Ref. [4], for the quasi-TE mode of the rib waveguide of 
structure 1 (single-mode waveguide). In the proposed method, the number of terms in the Fourier 
cosine series expansion (i.e., N) varies from 15 to 41, and these effn  converge to 3.388646. It is 
evident that the calculated effn  is almost the same as those obtained by BeamPROP and Ref. [4]. 
The CPU time spent by the proposed method is only 0.38 sec for N = 41, while BeamPROP needs 
much more time. Here, the result obtained by the widely-used commercial software BeamPROP with 
the finest discretization shown in the table is considered as a benchmark. The relative error caused by 
the proposed method is thus about 3x 10-6.  
The rib waveguide of structure 2 was studied by a semi-analytic method (i.e., Fourier operator 
transform method) outlined in Ref. [15]. The proposed method is also used to calculate the modal 
index effn  of this single-mode waveguide. From Table 3 we can see the modal indices calculated 
by the proposed method, the software BeamPROP and Ref. [15] for the quasi-TE mode. It is clear 
that the calculated values of effn  for increasing N converge to a value quite close to that obtained 
by BeamPROP. Meanwhile we can see that the effn  obtained by Ref. [15] for this waveguide is 
relatively inaccurate, noting that the result obtained by BeamPROP is considered as a benchmark. 
Note that the three semi-analytic methods described in Ref.[15] (i.e., the discrete spectral index 
method, the generalized Fourier variational method and the Fourier operator transform method) all 
yielded an inaccurate result, compared with the proposed method. The proposed method produces the 
results with an error of 3x 610− for the quasi-TE mode. The CPU times spent by the proposed method 
is  only 2.52 sec. However, BeamPROP would spend much more CPU time, as indicated in the 
table. 
Table 4 shows the calculated effn  for the quasi-TM mode of the structure-1 waveguide. We 
can see that the proposed method produces almost the same result as those obtained by BeamPROP 
and Ref. [4] with N= 32 for the quasi-TM mode. Again, note that the result obtained by BeamPROP 
with the finest discretization shown in the tables can be considered as a benchmark. The relative error 
caused by the proposed method is thus about 3x 10-6. The calculated field distribution of the 
quasi-TM mode is shown by the contour drawn in Fig. 3, where contour levels are at 4.5% intervals 
of the maximum field. The proposed method is also used to calculate the modal index effn  of the 
structure-2 waveguide. From Table 5 we can see the modal indices calculated by the proposed 
method, the software BeamPROP and Ref. [15] for the quasi-TM mode. The calculated values of 
effn  for increasing N converge to a value quite close to that obtained by BeamPROP. Meanwhile we 
can see that the effn  obtained by Ref. [15] for this waveguide is relatively inaccurate, noting that 
the result obtained by BeamPROP is considered as a benchmark. The proposed method produces the 
result with an errors of 2x 510− for the quasi-TM mode. The CPU times spent by the proposed method 
is only 0.41 sec for the quasi-TM mode, much less than that needed by BeamPROP.

4. Conclusion 
We have proposed a new semi-analytic method to compute the eigenmodes of optical rib 
waveguides. In the proposed method, the cross-section of a rib waveguide is divided into several 
regions. The wave equation is then treated separately in each region. By expanding the modal field as 
well as the index profile into a Fourier cosine series, a second-order differential matrix equation 
corresponding to the wave equation in each region is derived. An analytic solution form for the 
modal field in each region can then be readily found. By matching the boundary conditions at the 
interfaces between two adjacent regions, we obtain an eigenmode equation to be solved for modal 
indices. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, two examples (which were previously 
studied) are given in this study. Numerical results show that the modal index can be found quite 
accurately and furthermore the CPU time spent in computation is much less than that when using the 
commercial software BeamPROP.

Chapter 2 Shortening the Longitudinal Length of Waveguide Beam 
Splitters by Using Tilted Layout 
 
 
Abstract-A new layout of waveguide beam splitters is presented for the first time to shorten the size. In this 
layout, some 1x2 beam splitters, i.e., the building blocks of a 1xN (where N ≧ 4) beam splitter, are not placed in 
parallel with each other as in the design for conventional ones. These building blocks are tilted in some angles to 
relieve waveguide bending and reduce the bend loss. A 1x8 beam splitter is demonstrated to show the reduction in 
size to a half with respect to the conventional counterpart.  
Keywords: optical waveguide, beam splitter, excess loss, fiber coupling loss, bend loss. 
 
 
1.Introduction 
Optical beam splitters are important components for signal branching in passive 
optical network (PON) systems. As the fiber-to-the-home technology booms owing to the 
increasing demand for wider communication bandwidth, GPONs (giga PONs) with 
1x16,1x32 and even 1x64 beam splitters incorporated in use have attracted worldwide 
attention [1,2]. Waveguide beam splitters play an important role in realizing these systems 
because they are compact in size (compared with the conventional counterparts) and can be 
mass produced[ 3-8].  
     Conventional waveguide beam splitters are fabricated by a photolithographic or 
e-beam lithographic technique followed by an etching process. To form a 1xN (N≧4) 
splitter, they usually use multiple 1x2 splitters as building blocks. These building blocks are 
always patterned in parallel as shown in Fig. 1 (a) in the case of a 1x8 beam splitter. It is 
noted that such waveguide beam splitters would couple to optical fibers at their output ends 
for practical application and thus requiring at least 125μm for each spacing between fibers. 
It is proposed here that the building blocks of a 1xN (N≧4) beam splitter can be tilted in 
order to reduce the bending of each branch and the length of the whole device. Before 
showing our new design pattern, a SiO2-based 1x8 waveguide beam splitter in the layout of 
Fig. 1(a) was re-studied first. We assumed a spacing of 127μm between fibers at the output 
end. Seven 1x2 splitters were used for this beam splitter and each one was of MMIC 
(multimode interference coupler) type as shown by the enlarged portion in Fig. 1(a). The 
cross-section of the single-mode waveguide for this case, as shown in Fig. 1(b), is a 
square-like region (with a core of the refractive index n1=1.4901) clad by a medium of 
lower refractive index (n2=1.4839). The waveguide would operate near the cutoff of the 
second-order mode,and that means evanescent wave is kept low enough in this case. The 
longitudinal length of the 1x8 beam splitter is totally 13000μm ( with the segmental 
lengths shown in Fig.1(a)). Such a long waveguide length is required for low enough bend 
losses incurred by the branches connecting two MMICs.

2. Proposed Layout 
    To start with the study of the proposed 1x8 beam splitter, we first re-draw the layout of 
the conventional 1x8 beam splitter (i.e., Fig. 1(a)), but adding some dashed lines to show 
the new layout. The resultant figure is shown in Fig.2, where the second-stage and 
third-stage MMICs, as well as the required branches of the new design are drawn in dashed 
lines. These components and branches drawn in dashed lines and the first-stage MMIC 
form a new 1x8 beam splitter.  It can be seen that these newly-added MMICs are placed 
closer to the first-stage MMIC. And most obviously, some MMICs ( such as the 
second-stage and the two outermost third-stage MMICs) are tilted against conventional 
longitudinal orientation.  
 
Fig.2 Shown in dashed lines are the new layout for some MMICs and branches. 
 
Because the second-stage MMICs are tilted, the subsequent branches might go along a
