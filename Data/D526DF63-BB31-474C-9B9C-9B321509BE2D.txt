 Abstract 
Overexpression of recombinant N-acetyl-D- 
glucosamine 2-epimerase, one of the key enzymes 
for the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid, in E. 
coli led to the formation of protein inclusion 
bodies. In this study we report the recovery of 
active epimerase from inclusion bodies by direct 
solubilization with Tris buffer. At pH 7.0, 25% of 
the inclusion bodies were solubilized with Tris 
buffer. The specific activity of the solubilized 
proteins, 2.08±0.02 U/mg, was similar to that of 
the native protein, 2.13±0.01 U/mg. The result of 
circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis indicated 
that the structure of the solubilized epimerase 
obtained with pH 7.0 Tris buffer was similar to 
that of the native epimerase purified from the 
clarified cell lysate. As expected, the extent of 
deviation in CD spectra increased with buffer pH. 
The total enzyme activity recovered by 
solubilization from inclusion bodies, 170.41± 
10.06 U/l, was more than 2.5 times higher than 
that from the clarified cell lysate, 67.32±5.53 U/l. 
The results reported in this study confirm the 
hypothesis that the aggregation of proteins into 
inclusion bodies is reversible and suggest that 
direct solubilization with non-denaturing buffers is 
a promising approach for the recovery of active 
proteins from inclusion bodies, especially for 
aggregation-prone multisubunit proteins.

1. Introduction 
Although a general approach for protein 
renaturation from inclusion bodies, involving 
solubilization and reduction of protein aggregates 
and subsequent refolding and oxidation of the 
solubilized protein has long been established, 
activity yields are generally low due to 
re-aggregation of the solubilized polypeptide 
chains during the refolding process. In our 
previous effort with a fed-batch refolding strategy, 
the activity yield of epimerase obtained was only 
30% with a specific activity less than 40% of the 
native protein. 
Instead of using high concentration of 
denaturants, such as 6 M guanidine hydrochloride 
or 8 M urea, milder conditions for inclusion body 
solubilization protein, involving the use of alkaline 
buffers, have been previously proposed for the 
refolding of recombinant proteins under the 
premise that protein inside inclusion body 
aggregates may assume native-like secondary 
structure [1]. Recently, it has further been reported 
that inclusion bodies obtained at low growth 
temperature might contain correctly folded 
recombinant protein and thus could be readily 
extracted with nondenaturing solvents [2]. 
Although it has been shown that the percentages 
of correctly folded proteins in inclusion bodies 
might varied greatly depending on the nature of 
proteins, the notion that inclusion bodies contains 
correctly folded protein might be a common 
phenomenon, regardless of the folding pathways 
of proteins [3]. The activity yields reported were 
generally higher than those obtained for processes 
involving the use of harsher solubilization 
processes with chaotrophic agents. In light of 
these findings, we investigated in this study the 
feasibility of recovering active proteins from 
inclusion bodies by solubilization with 
non-denaturing buffers.  
  
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Microorganism and culture conditions 
Recombinant E. coli NovaBlue (Novagen, USA) 
containing plasmid pQEE harboring the gene 
encoding porcine kidney N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 
2-epimerase (courtesy of Dr. W.H. Hsu., Institute 
of Molecular Biology, National Chung-Hsing 
University, Taiwan) was grown in 100 ml LB 
medium (USB, USA) at 37 oC. The 
overexpression of epimerase was induced by 
adding IPTG (Sigma, USA) to a final 
concentration of 1.0 mM, when the optical density 
of the culture measured at 600 nm reached 1.0. 
Upon induction, the cultivation temperature was 
either maintained at 37 oC or reduced to 25 oC. In 
both cases, the E. coli cells were harvested 12 h 
after induction by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 
10 min.  
 decline in specific activity for epimerase 
solubilized with pH 8.0 Tris solution cannot be 
solely attributed to the intrinsic decline in activity 
at high pH, because, as shown in Table 1, the 
specific activity of native epimerase declined only 
10.8 % from 2.13 ± 0.01 U/mg to 1.90 ± 0.05 
U/mg over the same pH range, suggesting that the 
conformation of epimerase solubilized from 
inclusion bodies at pH 8.0 was significantly 
different from that of the native epimerase at the 
same pH. Further increase in solution pH could 
further alter the conformation of epimerase as 
suggested by a complete loss of activity at pH 
above 9.0.  
As shown in Table 1, the specific activity of 
epimerase solubilized from inclusion bodies with 
pH 7.0 Tris solution was essentially identical to 
that of the native protein at the same pH, and is 
more than threefold higher than refolded proteins 
obtained by a fed-batch refolding process reported 
in our previous study. The optimal pH for the 
recovery of active epimerase from inclusion 
bodies coincides with the optimal reaction pH of 
the enzyme, as shown in Table 1.  The total 
enzyme activity recovered by solubilization from 
inclusion bodies obtained from 1 l culture, 170.41 
U, was more than 2.5 times higher than that from 
the clarified cell lysate obtained from equal 
volume of culture, 67.32 U. This result is 
consistent with the notion that inclusion bodies 
contain native-like proteins [1] and, therefore, 
should not be disregarded for the recovery and 
purification of recombinant proteins. The results 
obtained also support the hypothesis that the 
aggregation of recombinant proteins into inclusion 
bodies in E. coli is, at least in part, reversible.  
 
3.2 Structure analysis by circular dichroism 
spectroscopy 
   To elucidate the possible structural 
differences between the epimerase recovered from 
inclusion bodies and the native epimerase purified 
from the clarified cell lysate, circular dichroism 
(CD) spectroscopy analysis of the various protein 
preparations was performed. Absorption in the far 
UV region, 240 nm and below, due to peptide 
bonds can provide valuable information about the 
secondary structure of proteins. The mean residue 
ellipticity of the native epimerase at a wavelength 
of 222 nm corresponding to n → * transition was 
monitored. As shown in Fig. 3, the mean residue 
ellipticity of epimerase increased from -9.3×103 
deg/cm2 dmol1 to -2.0×103 deg/cm2 dmol1when the 
solution pH was increased from 4.0 to 12.0. While 
the mean residue ellipticities measured at pH 6.0, 
pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 were reasonably close, a sharp 
increase in the mean residue ellipticity was 
observed between pH 9.0 and pH 10.0. This 
observation is consistent with the results of 
activity measurements. As shown in Table 1, 
while at pH 9.0 the epimerase retained a specific 
activity of 0.90±0.02 U/mg, ca. 42% of what 
measured at pH 7.0, a complete loss of enzyme 
activity was observed at pH 10.0. The extent of 
deviation in mean residue ellipticitiy can thus be 
used as a measure of variation in protein 
conformation and thus enzyme activity. 
CD spectroscopy analysis of both native and 
the solubilized epimerase over the far UV region 
was performed. Consistent with the specific 
activities measured, the CD spectra of the native 
epimerase and the solubilized epimerase at pH 7.0 
are almost identical as shown in Fig. 4. The 
calculated contents of 　-helix structure, based on 
the CONTIN algorithm, of the native epimerase 
and the solubilized epimerase at pH 7.0, 25% and 
24%, respectively, are essentially identical as 
shown in Table 2. However, the native and the 
solubilized epimerases exhibited different 
responses to the change in buffer pH. For the 
native epimerase, the CD spectra and contents of 
　-helix structure at pH 7.0 and 8.0 are similar, 
indicating that the structure of the native 
epimerase is stable at the said pH range. This 
result is in line with the result of activity analysis, 
as shown in Table1, and mean residue ellipticity 
measurements, as shown in Fig. 4. No significant 
deviation in CD spectra or change in the content of 
-helix structure was observed until the buffer pH 
reached 9.0. At pH 9.0, the content of  -helix 
structure for the native epimerase decreased to 19 
%, accompanied by a concomitant increase in the 
content of 　-strand and unordered structure. Such 
change in CD spectrum and thus protein structure 
is reflected by the relatively low specific activity, 
0.90±0.02 U/mg, as shown in Table 1. 
For the solubilized epimerase the CD 
spectrum and the content of 　-helix structure at 
pH 8.0 deviated significantly from that measured 
at pH 7.0, suggesting solubilization of misfolded 
epimerase under alkaline conditions. In fact, the 
CD spectrum and the content of 　-helix structure 
of the solubilized epimerase at pH 8.0 resembled 
that of the native epimerase at pH 9.0. These 
finding are consistent with the results of activity 
analysis, Table 1. The specific activity of the
