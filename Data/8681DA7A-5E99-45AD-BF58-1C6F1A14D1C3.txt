Key Words: (System on Chip, Scan Test, Test Compression, Test Power) 
Advances on System on Chip in its size and complexity in recent years lead to two issues on 
scan testing, first, the large size of test data makes test time, consequently, test cost increase; 
second, the test power also becomes intolerable. In this project, we offer a solution to above issues.  
We have proposed a new random access multiple scan design which differs from the 
conventional random access scan design in its access is addressed by column instead of a single bit. 
The number of cells of each column is arranged to be the number of scan chains. It utilizes a clock 
generator to produce clock signals which activate columns during pattern shifting and uses a new 
scan cell, which can hold two bits, to provide a bypasses path to reduce the transition power of 
scan path as well as the clock power. It can not only reduce shifting power but also reduce capture 
power with no need to consider the capture dependency of scan cells. It also can be used for delay 
test with arbitrary two test patterns to obtain power reduction.

ABSTRACT 
In this work, a column-addressable multiple scan (CAMS) 
architecture is proposed for the scan-based design to reduce 
testing power. The architecture utilizes a clock generator to 
produce clock signals during pattern shifting and uses a new 
scan cell to provide a bypasses path to reduce the transition 
power of scan path as well as the clock power. It can not only 
reduce shifting power but also reduce capture power with no 
need to consider the capture dependency of scan cells. It also 
can be used for delay test with arbitrary two test patterns to 
obtain power reduction. Experimental results show that it can 
save total test power and peak power by up to 73% compared to 
the conventional multiple scan design. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
For the scan-based design ICs, creative scan architectures 
were proposed to reduce the pattern-shifting power by reducing 
the number of transitions of CUT [1-8]. However, for the delay 
test, which requires two test patterns to test the circuit, work 
was rarely reported on dealing reducing the testing power. This 
paper proposes a column-addressable multiple scan (CAMS) 
architecture to tackle the problem of reducing the testing power 
even for the delay testing for the scan-based design. It utilizes a 
clock generator to produce clock signals during pattern shifting 
and uses a new scan cell which provides a bypasses path to 
reduce the transition power of scan path as well as the clock 
power, thus reducing both the shifting power and the capture 
power without the need to consider the capture dependency of 
scan cells.  
 
ARCHITECTURE  
 
The proposed CAMS architecture is shown in Figure 1, 
which is a traditional multiple scan (MS) architecture with a 
clock generator (CGen) which provides two non-overlapping 
clock signals. The test responses of scan chains are fed to a 
MISR to be compacted to be a signature. In the test mode, each 
column can be accessed randomly by controlling the clock 
signals of each column. When one column is addressed, the 
scan-in data will be stored in that column while the test 
response of that column will pass to the next column. The 
proposed scan cell shown in Figure 2 can achieve the above 
mechanism. For the cell, CLK1 and CLK2 clock the master and 
slave latches respectively. In addition, CLK1 controls the 
shifting of the scan-in data SI to the next scan cell without 
affecting the content of the present cell. This makes the latch 
transparent.  
The CAMS has the following advantages as compared to the 
traditional multiple scan (MS) structure: 
Power Reduction: For the traditional MS structure, it needs 
to take k transfers, which may cause k transitions both in the 
scan path and the CUT, to transfer data to the kth column. For 
CAMS, it only causes k transitions of a multiplexer and one 
transition in the CUT to do the same. Therefore, the power 
consumed is much lower than that of the conventional MS. 
Furthermore, for the pattern loading, the clock is gated only for 
the addressed one. For the conventional MS, if N scan cells of 
the CUT is organized into √N x √N configuration (√N scan 
chains each with √N shift length), the total number of clock 
transitions to shift a test pattern is N x √N. For CAMS, the 
clock transitions is only N. The clock power is reduced by (√
N-1) times!

applied to low power two-pattern delay test. It can achieve the 
column reordering without using the complicated multiplexers 
and wiring to save test power. The added clock tree is very 
regular, hence is very easy to be routed with commercial 
place-and-route tools. Experimental results have shown the 
scheme achieves 73% test power reduction with only 10% 
penalty in the area cost. Table 3 compiles comparison of CAMS 
with some other conventional schemes and it can be seen that 
CAMS has many advantages. It is a very good design for 
multiple scan when the test power and delay testing are 
considered.

Reordering of Scan Cells: CAMS also has a good feature to 
support reordering [4] of scan cells of columns. This can further 
reduce the test power. The traditional reordering approach uses 
multiplexing wire network which are adaptively routed for scan 
cells according to test patterns to achieve the power reduction.
