both Gregory et al. (1992, 1993) and Cowpertwait (1991) have found that the 
variability of seasonal totals and the autocorrelation of daily amounts are both lower.  
The LARS-WG approach (Semenov and Brooks, 1999) uses a semi-empirical 
approach that, although an improvement upon a basic Markov process, is still unable 
to provide a correlation between precipitation amounts on successive wet days, the 
reproduction of dry spells or extreme rain events (Kilsby et al., 2007). However, the 
stillness of generation are still improved (Kilsby et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2009), the 
validation of these weather generators are also presented in months. 
There are several methods to present or detect a drought event, which are 
dependent on different purposes and different components. Many researchers have 
reported drought indexes to present that such as Standardized precipitation Index 
(SPI, Mckee et al., 1993), the Crop specific index(CSDI; Meyer et al .1993), Palmer 
Drought Severity Index(PDSI; Palmer, 1965), Soil moisture Drought Index(SMDI; 
Hollinger et al., 1993), and Effective Drought Index (EDI; Kim et al., 2009), etc. Among 
these indexes, SPI is the most commonly used. Even two limitations are presented, 
including monthly considered and only for a certain period (Kim et al., 2009). The SPI 
becomes commonly method, because the method is simple and only based on 
precipitation. When a hydrological model and water resource model are ready, the 
SPI method is powerful to present a drought and the corresponding precipitation can 
be directly used as input in a hydrological model. 
The purpose of this study is to build a daily weather generator with the 
standard precipitation index from copula generator. Our main interests is on the 
ability of drought properties of weather generators. Several cases are provided to 
test the ability. 
2. Method 
Records of four weather stations from 1976 to 2007, in Taiwan are used in this 
threshold -1 
-mean SPI is defined as the mean of SPI values within a drought event. 
-minimum SPI is the minimum value within a drought even. 
The regional parameter is not considered in our study. A drought event can be 
displayed by these three parameters, which may present separated or jointed 
behaviors. The copula method is a powerful to deal with this problem. Serinaldi et al. 
(2009) showed an application of copula to the probability analysis of drought 
characteristics. Drought occurrences are analyzed by the SPI, mean SPI, minimum SPI 
and regional parameter.  
The weather generator with the ability to describe drought characteristics is 
the main purpose of this study. The new generator is combine WGEN and drought 
characteristics, but two different time scales in WGEN and drought characteristics. 
The most popular drought characteristics are from the SPI in monthly time step and 
the WGEN generate daily precipitation. Merging these two features into a drought 
event is an important process in this study. In this study, weather generation merging 
with copula generation drought event is called as WGMCD. Detail processes are 
follows. 
(1)Historical statistics 
The weather feature is from observed daily precipitation records and monthly 
statistics which are mean precipitation, rainfall rate, rainfall distributions are built. A 
drought event defined as the SPI below -1. The drought characteristics are described 
by the starting drought month, duration, drought strength, and minimum drought. 
From the monthly precipitation and the SPI method (McKee, 1993), the drought 
events in record can be screened. For preparing the generating by copula, the 
marginals of these four parameters are built, based on SKlar’s theorem (Sklar, 1959), 
every joint distribution can be written in terms of a copula and its univariate marginal 
switched at the same time. Because the SPI is based on the aggregated precipitation 
in three months, the months before the starting month is included in switch. For 
speeding the procedure, three steps are built in switch for fitting suitable 
precipitation and allowed ten percent error in switch. First is the random choosing in 
the pool, which is corresponding months in switch. When the precipitation can be 
fitting the SPI arrangement among the event, the first step is finished and dealing 
with the next drought event. Ten percent error is accepted; otherwise, it is hardly 
possible to find perfect fit period for drought all events. For validation our results, 
four parameters, which are the number of drought event, drought duration, drought 
strength and maximum drought during, are involved. 
 
3. Results 
Copula generation of drought events and the drought characteristics are 
validated. Figure 3 shows the Q-Q plot of the four drought characteristics, including 
the starting month, duration, average SPI and minimum SPI. Figure 3(a) and Figure 
3(b) are analyzed from historical drought events and copula generation of drought 
event. The results show the copula generation is a efficient tool to generate and 
represent drought events. In our study, two discrete variables, the starting month 
and duration, are generated. The patterns of results are close to the historical events. 
In the average SPI and minimum SPI, the different exists between historical and 
generated data. Some ladder-like patterns exist in copula generation. Because the 
constrain of minimum SPI should be less than when the duration is more than one 
month and be equal to average SPI when the duration is one month. For example, 
the failure in Kaohsiung is about 28.7% in generation during one thousand times 
generation 
The results after WGEN and merging the drought characteristics show as Fig.

心得報告 
本次參與 2011AWRA Spring Specialty Conference舉辦日期為 2011/4/18-20，
發表日期為 4/20，session 14:Modeling Tools II，發表內容如附件。本次討論的議
題主要為氣候變遷在水資源影響上，內容涵蓋操作、策略、水量、水質、模式、
調適、海洋與海岸、水資源供給、能源、暴雨與模式工具。在水資源需求問題上，
Elisabeth Jenicek 發表內容主要為在氣候變遷對水資源供給與需求問題上，美國
陸軍已經將此問題視為一重要，事實上人類活動對於地下水與地表水的影響已經
越來越顯著，可用資源也越來越少，在用水安全上，該單位建立一套用水的脆弱
度地圖，除以往水利工程建設外，陸軍也針對不同地區的地理、水文、政治環境
等，推估氣候變遷後的可能影響，並結合區域性的各項行動，以確保長期的供水
安全問題。 Kirshen等在水資源問題，也對於遠距離的水資源規劃問題提出建議，
因為氣候變遷的影響涵蓋時間尺度長與空間尺度大的特性，因此應用上受限於不
缺定性極高的特性在規畫上極為困難，而在考量不同情境條件下往往最對應出的
調適方法不盡相同，因此，如何選定調適方案則為本研究的重點，除可以利用邏
輯性的建立不同情境外，可增加多階段不同層級的組合與發生機率，以選擇適當
調適策略，策略中的層級可以目前所知與外來推行與規劃的內容進行架構分析，
以確保如上位計畫、中期與長期等計畫位階；而部分策略或調適方案有關連性或
是具有排斥關係應進一步釐清；其他如社會經濟與生物多樣性問題也被同時提及，
對有些調適策略與社會經濟等問題，關聯性較不明確。Lopez等提出的研究為量
化水資源影響的研究上，採用合成 1000年的溫度資料以評估氣候變遷的可能影
響，採用統計特性分析可能變化情形，也就是研究中所謂的混和經驗模式，並以
實際流量為驗證的依據，其中主要為建立相關資訊的關聯性，就部分需求或供給
而言，可與水文量、氣候特性、經濟條件相互結合以建立未來氣候變遷評估的依
據。 
Vazquez 等人發表一份有關一個島嶼社區所建立的暴雨規劃與管理系統，由
準值逐一向上修訂的同時，如何取得空間、區位、設施所應負起的調適責任，而
非全由公共設施來負擔所有累積的風險為下一個重要課題。

Toward a Collaborative Water Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation: Federal Agencies Working Together
Matt Larsen, USGS  
When President Obama directed the federal agencies to form an Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, 
several workgroups were formed to examine particular issues in depth. One was the Water Workgroup, co-chaired by 
the Department of Interior's USGS, the US EPA, and the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The Water 
Workgroup evaluated a range of climate change and water resources adaptation challenges and developed 
recommendations that were included in the Progress Report of the Task Force released in October. This presentation 
will describe the work underway for building national capacity and resilience in the water sector. 
NOAA Climate Program Office 
Chester J. Koblinsky  
Individuals and decision-makers across widely diverse sectors – from agriculture to energy to transportation – are 
increasingly asking for authoritative and timely information about climate change in order to make the best choices for 
their families, communities and businesses. To meet the rising tide of these requests, NOAA and the other agencies 
of the US Global Change Research Program have been working to strengthen and integrate climate science and 
service delivery capabilities. This discussion will give participants a chance to understand NOAA and interagency 
plans to provide improved climate services. 
DOI Landscape Conservation Cooperatives and Climate Science Center- Thomas Armstrong  
The Department of the Interior is establishing Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) and Climate Science 
Centers (CSCs) to address current and future impacts of climate change on our land, water, wildlife, cultural heritage 
and tribal resources. The regional CSCs and their partnership networks will provide science to understand which 
resources are most vulnerable to climate change. The LCCs are intended to engage federal agencies, local and state 
partners, and the public in crafting practical, landscape-level strategies for managing climate change impacts on 
natural resources. This presentation will provide a birds-eye view of progress in establishing these regional centers 
and discuss opportunities for local engagement.

The answer to the question depends on the particular circumstances of an individual utility. For utilities dependent on 
reservoirs, the answer is very likely to involve investigating Dynamic Reservoir Operations, but is also likely to include 
demand management, watershed management, and perhaps new facilities. Each panelist will be given a particular 
"case" utility and asked to prepare a short description of what may and may not be appropriate in that case. The panel 
will discuss the cases and then open the discussion to the audience at large.
