Abstract: - This paper is to continue our previous work (Niu, 2006) on solving a locally homogeneous two-phase 
mixture for water-steam flows using a modified AUSMDV scheme.  Here, a simple unified hybrid flux splitting 
algorithm for multi-phase flows with arbitrary equation of state based on the preconditioning derived from 
AUSMD scheme (Wada and Liou, 1997) and flux difference scheme (Weiss and Smith, 1995)  is proposed 
presented. In the cavitated flow model, we consider a homogeneous two-phase mixture model with the 
assumption of kinematics and thermodynamics equilibriums. The thermodynamics behaviors of liquid phase, 
vapor phase and their phase transitional process are described by a temperature dependent hybrid equation of 
state which includes an empirical formula of water-vapor saturation process. The preconditioning strategy is 
utilized to reformulate the compressible mixture type Navier-Stokes equations coupling with a 
condensation-vaporization convective equation to be hyperbolic at all-speed. The proposed  robust low diffusion 
upwind flux splitting is shown to be robust in the simulation of several general cases at steady and transient 
states which include two-phase nozzles, shock tubes and low-speed cavitating flows over a 3D blunt body.

1   Introduction 
 
The development of high-resolution algorithms to 
simulate perfect gas flow problems has achieved 
tremendous progress during the past 20 years. Based 
on successful resolutions of shock waves and 
discontinuities in single phase flows, these successful 
numerical techniques are currently applied on the 
simulation of the compressible hydrodynamics flow 
problems which contain the complicated phase 
interfaces, material discontinuities and phase 
transition behaviors. These multi-phase transitioning 
flow phoenomena, widely seen in the power cooling 
system, the fuel transport system, the underwater 
cavitation, recently attract many efforts in developing 
the related numerical models.  As we know, the low 
Mach number hydrodynamics usually is considered 
as incompressible. The incompressible flow 
assumption always ignores the density variation and 
the thermodynamics property of pressure. In the 
formulation of incompressible flows, the 
hyperbolicity is no longer considered. Consequently, 
the related propagation of the acoustic waves and the 
compressibility are ignored in the simulation. As 
noted in [1, 2], cavitation is one of important 
phenomena in compressible hydrodynamics.  
Cavitation is well known to associate with three 
aspects: formation, growth and collapse of bubbles 
within the body of a liquid due to the process of 
nucleation in a liquid flow where the pressure falls 
below the vapor pressure. During the liquid-vapor 
phase transitions, vapor bubbles or cavities in a fluid 
usually collapse at a high frequency and generate 
high pressure gradients and acoustic waves to erode 
microscopic pieces of metal if they are close to the 
metallic wall. Therefore, the acoustic waves induced 
by abrupt density variation and the pressure drop 
during the phase change of cavitating flows would be 
beyond the scope of the incompressible flow 
assumption. 
A primary issue in the simulation of compressible 
cavitated flow is how to accurately simulate 
multi-acoustic phenomena [3, 4]. The speed of sound 
in two-phase mixtures can be extremely low 
compared to the sound speeds in the individual 
component phases. Thus, multiphase flows are 
frequently characterized by local regions, wherein 
the flow may be transonic or even supersonic with the 
presence of shocks, although the bulk of the flow 
may remain essentially incompressible. This 
situation presents a big challenge, especially to the 
numerical stability of algorithms. Several numerical 
methods have been proposed in the past in order to 
The 6th IASME/WSEAS International Conference on FLUID MECHANICS and AERODYNAMICS 
Rhodes (Rodos) Island, Greece, August 20-22, 2008 
and AUSM+up based on preconditioning strategy are 
performed for the comparison. 
 
 
 
2   Problem Formulation 
 
In this study, a two-dimensional two phase mixture 
model with a saturation model and a precondition 
matrix is proposed here. In the numerical strategy, a 
TVD type Runge-Kutta Time accurate scheme is 
used to solve the model equation to keep the 
numerical stability. In the spatial differencing, the 
interface conservative variables are determined 
through a third order accurate MUSCL interpolation 
[27] with the minmod limiter. Subsequently, the flux 
splitting based on an improved AUSMDV to 
discretize the convective fluxes of, gas mass, total 
mass, momentum, energy, respectively. In addition, 
to model the phase transitions among the steam-water 
mixture, three equations of state for water, vapor and 
saturation states modified from [18, 26] based on 
local phase equilibrium are selected together to yield 
a smooth link at the so-called spinodal points, the 
extreme points on the both sides of the saturation 
zone in the temperature-pressure diagram, also 
accurately cover the range ( KTK 15.62315.273 ≤≤  & 
( ) MPapTps 100≤≤ ). They are briefly described as 
the following sections: 
 
 
2.1 Governing Equations 
 
For all-speed flow regime, a preconditioning strategy is to 
extend the functionality of existing codes for fully 
compressible flows to almost incompressible flows. 
Applying the preconditioning method to Eq. (1), we obtain 
2-D preconditioned governing equations with unknown 
variable vectors W = [p, u, v, w, T, Y ] written in curvilinear 
coordinates as follows [13]: Here we used the 
preconditioning techniques of Weiss and Smith which 
introduced artificial time scale τ  and a reconditioning 
matrix to rescale the original governing equations A 
mixture type two-phase compressible Navier-Stokes 
Equations conjunction with a mass-fraction (Y) type 
cavitation model and a water-vapor saturation model based 
on hybrid equations of state are chosen here.  They are 
demonstrated as

formulation (9-18), the diagrams of speed of sound to the 
gas volume fraction and the pressure to density for 
temperature=300k are depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2, 
respectively. It is shown that the speed of sound is near 
1500 m/s for a pure liquid, the speed of sound for a pure 
vapor is over 400 m/s and the minimum effective speed of 
sound of the saturated flow is below 5 m/s.   Also from 
Figure 2, we can see the curve of pressure to density on the 
diagram is convex and connected smoothly.

Spatial Difference： 
 
Considering the derivative of the convective flux in the ξ 
-direction, we use the following difference formula for the 
flux derivatives: 
 
The convective flux at the cell interfaces is computed by 
the Roe type flux-difference splitting.  The flux difference 
splitting scheme is constructed based on the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix A . This approach 
admits that numerical flux F contains the characteristic 
information propagating through the domain, with speed 
and direction according to the eigenvalues of the system. 
By splitting F into parts, where each part contains the 
information traveling in a particular direction, i.e., 
characteristic information, and the split fluxes are 
differenced according to the directions of the 
corresponding wave propagation, the interface numerical 
flux of each cell is then expressed as

Concluded Remarks 
 
In this work, a modification of the AUSMDV scheme 
based on the preconditioning scaled techniques is shown to 
be robust and accurate in the solving an all-speed type 
compressible cavitated water-vapor flow model with VOF 
type phase transition effects. Numerical validations are 
performed on the cases of an unsteady 1D 
shock-condensation tube and a quasi-1D nozzle flow. Also, 
the modified AUSMDV achieves robust and stable 
calculations of the cavitation phenomena in the 2D injector 
nozzle and blunt body flows. Though the turbulence 
effects are not considered in our computations, numerical 
validation against experimental data in the simulation of 
blunt body flows is satisfactory and demonstrates a very 
similar surface pressure coefficient prediction as the data 
of Rouse and McNown [28]. A further work is required to 
study physical phenomena contain many sizes of length 
and time scales such as the turbulence effects and surface 
tension effects of bubbles.
