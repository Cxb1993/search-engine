Abstract—This study proposes an efficient detection algorithm4
for double space-time block codes (DSTBCs) to improve the algo-5
rithm of Kim et al. The proposed algorithm applies QR decom-6
position to the channel matrix of the DSTBC to obtain an upper7
triangular matrix. The diagonal entries of the upper triangu-8
lar matrix contain two different values. The proposed algorithm9
adaptively determines the number of candidates for the DSTBC10
according to the ratio of these two diagonal values. When their11
ratio is large, the number of the candidates decreases. Finally,12
the detection result is searched among the candidates based on13
a maximum-likelihood criterion. Numerical results demonstrate14
that the computational complexity for the search process can be15
reduced by 70% with little performance loss at a bit error rate16
(BER) of 10−4.17

I. INTRODUCTION21
THE DOUBLE space-time block code (DSTBC) [1] of22 a multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) system is also23
called the double space-time transmit diversity [2], [3] or rate-24
2 quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) [4]. The25
DSTBC provides higher symbol rate than the OSTBC [5] or26
the quasi-OSTBC [6] proposed by Alamouti and Jafarkhani,27
respectively. Nevertheless, its decoding complexity is lower28
than that of the high-rate space-time block code presented in29
[7]. The DSTBC provides a tradeoff between the decoding30
complexity and the symbol rate and has been adopted by the31
IEEE 802.11n [8] and 802.16e [9] standards.32
The DSTBC consists of two OSTBCs. Nevertheless, its33
detection is not as simple as that of the OSTBC. Traditional34
suboptimal algorithms such as zero forcing (ZF) and min-35
imum mean square error have low complexity but achieve36
poor error performance. On the other hand, search algorithms37
are employed for optimal detection results [1], [10], [11]. In38
this case, the detection results are based on the maximum-39
likelihood (ML) criterion. However, the detection complexity of40
the optimal search algorithm is usually high. Thus, researchers41
have proposed near-optimal search algorithms to reduce this42
complexity [4], [12].43

The QR decomposition is a popular technique to reduce 44
the computational complexity of a search algorithm to detect 45
MIMO signals [13]–[19]. It can also be applied to a channel 46
matrix corresponding to the DSTBC. Applying the QR decom- 47
position yields one orthonormal matrix and one upper triangular 48
matrix. The ML criterion is then computed according to the 49
upper triangular matrix in the search process. Because the upper 50
triangular matrix usually has more zero entries than the chan- 51
nel matrix, the resulting search process requires fewer com- 52
putations. Kim et al. proposed a low-complexity suboptimal 53
algorithm based on the QR decomposition [4]. This approach 54
first decodes one of the two OSTBCs. Several candidates for 55
the first decoded OSTBC are then used to search for the best 56
DSTBC solution based on the ML criterion. More candidates 57
lead to higher detection complexity and better performance. 58
The number of candidates is preset before detection in [4]. 59
Because the DSTBC includes two OSTBCs, only two differ- 60
ent values appear in the diagonal entries of the upper triangular 61
matrix. One value corresponds to the first stage of decoding to 62
decide the candidates. The other value is only used to search for 63
the best solution based on the ML criterion. If the first diagonal 64
value is much larger than the second diagonal value, then the 65
decoding in the first stage dominates the search. In this case, the 66
number of candidates can be reduced with little performance 67
loss. This study determines the number of candidates for the 68
first OSTBC based on the ratio of the two diagonal values. 69
Specifically, the searching complexity is directly related to the 70
relationship between the two diagonal values. Computer sim- 71
ulations show that the computational complexity of searching 72
for the best solution decreases by 70% when the bit error rate 73
(BER) is approximately 10−4. The error performance also 74
improves by up to 2.5 dB, compared with searching with fixed 75
complexity. 76
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 77
briefly addresses related works. Section III presents the pro- 78
posed algorithm. Section IV evaluates the performance of the 79
proposed algorithm. Finally, Section V draws conclusions and 80
presents directions for future work. 81

constellation points for sj and C = P 4, s˜C is the ML solution.131
When P = 2, a fast sorting method can be used to choose132
the C candidates; this significantly reduces the complexity.133
Because the upper four entries of x are interchangable with134
the lower four entries, the source symbols sj , j = 1, 2, . . . , 4135
may be estimated first, as previously mentioned. In [4], the136
estimation order is determined according to the relationship137
between138

. (6)
In other words, if H2 ≥ H1, the source symbols sj , j =139
5, 6, . . . , 8 are estimated first. Otherwise, the source symbols140
sj , j = 1, 2, . . . , 4 are estimated first. Note that H1 and H2141
are the channel responses corresponding to the two OSTBCs,142
respectively. This ordering technique reduces the search com-143
plexity of the algorithm. However, Kim et al. gave no analysis144
on the reduction.145
Equations (4) and (5) indicate that the searching process is di-146
rectly related to the upper triangular matrixR and, particularly,147
the values of δ1 and δ2. In many MIMO detection algorithms,148
the channel condition has an important effect on computational149
complexity in addition to performance [20]. In particular, the150
ordering technique is usually used to reduce the complexity151
[14]. Nevertheless, the complexity of the algorithm proposed152
by Kim et al. remains fixed when the values of P and C are153
determined in advance [4]. The relationship between H1 and154
H2 is only employed to improve performance. Therefore, the155
complexity of the algorithm may be reduced further through156
the relationship between δ1 and δ2.157
III. ADAPTIVE DETECTION SCHEME158
This section first reformulates the optimization problem in159
(5) and then indicates that the ratio (δ2/δ1) is critical for the160
algorithm in [4] from the reformulated optimization problem.161
When the number of candidates C in (5) is fixed, the ratio162
determines the probability that the ML solution is one of the163
candidates. An adaptive algorithm is proposed based on this164
indication at the end of this section.165

∆=

j=5

− s˜(p)j
)2
.
Notably, the values of d1(s˜(p)) and d2(s˜(p)) vary with the values167
of s˜(p)j , j = 1, 2, . . . , 8. The values of δ1, δ2, x˜j , and Rj,k are168
known at the receiver. The optimization problem in (5) can be 169
rewritten as 170
s˜C = arg min
s˜(p),p=1,2,...,C
(
δ21d1
(
s˜(p)
)
+ δ22d2

(
d1
(
s˜(p)
)
+
δ22
δ21
d2
(
s˜(p)
))
. (7)
That is, d2(s˜(p)) is weighted by (δ22/δ21) in the objective 171
function of (7). When (δ22/δ21) is larger, d2(s˜(p)) becomes 172
more critical in searching the best solution. The probability 173
that a candidate with larger d2(s˜(p)) is the ML solution is 174
lower. This implies that it may be unnecessary to estimate 175
sj , j = 1, 2, . . . , 4, using the candidate with larger d2(s˜(p)) in 176
a suboptimal detection algorithm. This effectively lowers the 177
value of C and reduces the computational complexity. Different 178
values of C may be found for different ranges of (δ22/δ21). Since 179
δ1 and δ2 are positive according to their definitions in (3), the 180
ratio (δ2/δ1) can be used instead for simplicity. 181
Since a larger value of (δ2/δ1) indicates a lower computa- 182
tional complexity, it is desired to change the decoding order for 183
increasing (δ2/δ1). Let H′

Therefore, if (δ2/δ1) ≥ (δ′2/δ′1), no interchange between the 187
first and last four columns of H is necessary. Otherwise, H′ is 188
chosen for DSTBC detection. However, it is necessary to apply 189
QR decomposition to bothH andH′ before making this choice. 190
Fortunately, these two decomposition operations can be avoided 191
because of the following lemma: 192
Lemma 1: H2 ≥ H1 if and only if (δ2/δ1) ≥ (δ′2/δ′1). 193

[4] with ten candidates and the proposed algorithm with (T1, T2, T3) =

can be determined when the BER performance is the best.251
Those values, which are marked by “×” in Fig. 1, are 0.93,252
0.66, and 0.66, respectively. Since T2 and T3 have the same253
best value, (T1, T2, T3) are set to be (0.93, 0.66, 0.66). In this254
case, only two thresholds are employed, and Step 3 of the255
proposed algorithm only requires two comparisons. Notably,256
the thresholds can be found at any SNR. Another possible257
choice for the SNR is 15 dB, at which point the BER is258
close to 10−3. The resulting thresholds are (1.13, 0.81, 0.61),259
necessitating the three comparisons in Step 3.260
This study also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed261
algorithm over that proposed by Kim et al. [4]. The previously262
found thresholds (0.93, 0.66, 0.66) are employed. Fig. 2 shows263
that, in the case of SNR ≥ 19 dB, the error performance of the264
proposed algorithm is almost identical to the method in [4].265
Fig. 4. BER performance for the scheme given in [4] with two or three

and (0.74, 0.54, 0.54) when 16-QAM modulation is implemented.
However, Fig. 3 shows that the average number of candidates 266
searched in the proposed scheme is only approximately 3.0. 267
Thus, the proposed algorithm decreases the complexity of find- 268
ing the best solution by 70%. Since the number of candidates is 269
determined based only on (δ2/δ1), which is computed from the 270
channel matrixH, the reduction is identical at all SNRs and for 271
all modulation methods. If the thresholds (1.13, 0.81, 0.61) are 272
used, the complexity reduction is 69%. The performance of the 273
proposed scheme is almost identical to that of the scheme given 274
in [4] at SNR ≥ 15 dB. 275
When (T1, T2, T3) = (∞,∞, 0), the proposed algorithm is 276
identical to the method using three candidates (C = 3) in [4]. 277
Its complexity for the searching process is close to the proposed 278
algorithm with (T1, T2, T3) = (0.93, 0.66, 0.66). However, the 279
proposed algorithm outperforms the method in [4] by 1.5 dB 280
at a BER of 10−4, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the pro- 281
posed algorithm with (T1, T2, T3) = (0.74, 0.54, 0.54) requires 282
an average of two candidates for the searching process. Fig. 4 283
shows that its performance is better than the method using two 284
candidates in [4] around 2.5 dB. 285
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 286
This paper has proposed an adaptive algorithm for DSTBC 287
decoding based on the channel condition. The proposed method 288
reduces computational complexity for searching by 70% with 289
little performance loss. When a decoder is power limited, the 290
searching complexity could be upper bounded. If only two 291
candidates for the best solution in average are allowed, the 292
error performance of the proposed algorithm achieves 2.5-dB 293
improvement at a BER of 10−4. 294
The performance of the proposed algorithm has been demon- 295
strated by computer simulations. However, future research 296
should theoretically analyze this method. Moreover, it would 297
be very useful to extend the proposed algorithm to soft-decision 298
decoding. 299
