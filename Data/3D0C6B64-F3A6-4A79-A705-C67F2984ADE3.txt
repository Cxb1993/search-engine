(三)、研究方法，進行步驟及執行進度 
    本計畫預期以三年時間完成對溶劑鑄膜技術的分析。因溶劑鑄膜技術相當複雜，三年分工
大致分為三大區塊，分年執行。第一年的工作大致以建立簡單製程、操作視窗及流體力學分析
為主。第二年的工作以熱傳、質傳的分析為主，主要偏重理論工具的建立，實驗部份可能利用
到工研院提供的材料進行分析。第三年的工作為建立對成膜之物性進行預測與分析，包括對光
學膜之雙折射現象，捲曲現象及剝離黏著性進行理論預測工作之建立和對實驗數據之比較與分
析。對於三年的工作內容分述如下： 
 
I、第一年工作 
    第一年的工作主要有三個項目，分別為(A)、設計建立鑄膜流場觀測系統，(B)、各種不同
物性溶液之鑄膜實驗與分析及決定操作視窗，(C)、利用商用軟體FLOW 3D 進行流場模擬，
並與實驗結果比較。其工作內容分述於下: 
 
(A)、設計建立鑄膜流場觀測系統 
    本實驗現有兩台 lab coater，可進行slot die coating 之實驗，其構造流程及照片如圖1，2 所
示，塗液經由pump 運送至 slot die 中展開成均勻液膜，然後塗佈至鍍鉻轉動之背輪上後，進
行塗佈視窗分析及缺陷觀測，之後利用刮刀及白色拭紙除去塗於背輪上之塗液，經recycle 再
反覆進行實驗。此種lab coater 之好處為實驗及觀測皆相當容易，但對於高黏度之塗液，則刮
刀無法快速移除背輪上之塗液，在殘存塗液上再進行塗佈，與實際情形不符，會造成觀測失真。
因此針對高黏度之鑄膜溶液而言，必須另行設計一個流動觀測系統，可以有效除去塗於基材上
之溶液，以保持觀察及量測結果之合理性。本計畫提出設計製作的lab 鑄膜觀測系統如圖3 所
示，用一小卷之基材，放卷後進行溶液鑄膜實驗，然後清除溶液，再進行收卷。其基本構想為
拉長溶液被清除所需之時間，而在鑄膜和操作上，與圖1 所示slot die lab coater 相似。此項設
備的困難之處在於用少量經費製作一穩定可靠之基材收放卷系統，在長期操作下不產生張力問
題，例如放收卷基材張力不勻，斜行等。圖3系統中之其他部份，如slot die，die mount 及清洗
系統皆不難製作，另一可能必須注意的問題是當以真實的溶液系統進行實驗時，會有溶劑揮發
的問題，亦必須設計一類似 Hood 的系統，抽走在實驗設備上之溶劑，連接於實驗室現有的
排氣Hood 中。 
 
(B)、溶液鑄膜實驗決定操作視窗： 
    此項實驗，類似以往slot die coating 決定操作式窗的方式。所謂操作視窗，就是一個可以
穩定操作範圍，通常如圖4 所示，以單位時間、單位塗佈寬度流量q 對基材拉速V 作圖，可
以得到一封閉的操作區域，在此區域內操作可以得到良好的鑄膜，區域以外，則會出現各種不
同的缺陷，將q 除V 作圖，得到鑄膜(濕膜)之厚度h，亦可以h 對V 作圖得到濕膜厚度的操作
視窗。溶劑鑄膜與slot die coating 最大的不同，在於因溶液黏度較高，因此模具與運送基材之
間的空隙(gap)較大，一般slot die coating gap 很少大於350 um，但是溶劑鑄膜之gap 可以從200 
um 延伸至1 公分左右。但是因溶液黏度較高，又不似curtain coating，以重力加速度為主要的
driving force，故其機制及各種缺陷需由實驗決定。本計畫在(A)項設備完成後，將以四大類溶
12 
 
顧部分所載，有關乾燥(包括熱傳與質傳)的理論模式之建構，在Duda 和Scriven 等之努力下已
相當完整，但是目前商用軟體，較少能有效建立合理之分析工具，其原因可能在於熱傳及質傳
中有相當多的物性參數，如不能準確預測這些參數，則不可能有效預測乾燥結果。本計畫預期
依據Lei 及Duda(表中所列)之熱傳及質傳模式，建立電腦程式，以作為理論之分析工具。本計
畫所預建立的模式，在基礎理論合於質量守恆及能量守恆，原則上是正確的，但是必須能精確
掌握材料物性之預測下，能測是理論預測的正確性。本計畫預定以兩種高分子材料，做為測試
比較的基礎，一為長春石化公司所生產的聚乙烯醇(poly vinyl alcohol)PVA，代號PB24。長春
所生產的PVA 取得容易，物性亦易於評估，且為水溶液，成膜性佳，故以手塗成膜，再於烘
箱內以定溫加熱，易於評估其乾燥的情況，可與理論預測做完整比較。PVA 光學薄膜亦為LCD 
面板偏光系統中重要之光學薄膜基材，目前全世界市場為日商Kuraray 公司壟斷，進化對PVA 
膜之研究成果，可以提供未來企圖製作PVA 膜的廠商參考。此外本計畫預期和工研院材化所
合作，由該單位提供研發中之PI 材料，對其物性進行預測或量測，然後以手塗鑄膜，進行乾
燥實驗。PI 為國內光學膜發展最關鍵的基材之中，工研院已投入極多心血開發此種高分子材
料，並已有專利保護。本計畫由工研院提供測試用之PI 材料，可能用於LCD 中之光學補償膜
或為可recycle 之PI，皆屬含揮發溶劑材料，其分析結果與水性PVA 有一定的區別，可以了解 
分析水性和溶劑性材料之同異之處。 
 
III、第三年的工作 
    第三年的工作，為對所得之鑄膜關鍵性的物性進行分析，分析的方式分為理論與實驗兩部
分。所謂關鍵性物性主要有三點，一為鑄膜之可剝離性。通常鑄膜在運送帶上乾燥或固化之後，
應加以剝離再進行後處理，而鑄膜是否能從運送帶上順利剝離而不產生缺陷，為溶劑鑄膜生產
的關鍵之一。富士寫真公司因為利用二層溶劑鑄膜技術，可以有效快速將TAC 膜從運送網帶上
剝離，才能有效提升量產速率達50 m/min。第二關鍵性物性為光學膜基材之雙折射性
(birefringence)。雙折射性之產生為光學膜在乾燥過程中有非等向應力收縮之情形，造成非
等向光折射率之不同，亦可利用此一性質製備LCD 面板所需用到的補償膜。第三項關鍵性質為
翹曲(curl)，此一特性代表光學膜材料在乾燥過程中 stress 收縮在machine 和transverse 
direction 上不同，造成光學膜之翹曲現象，此三種現象皆有人研究，相關重要文獻已列於前表
之中。本計畫預期先引用前人發展建立之數學模式，用以從理論上預測這三項物性，如同第II 
項之研究，模式之預測正確與否，在於對光學膜材料之物性是否能做精確的預估和量測。本計
畫預期使用PVA 膜及工研院材化所提供的PI 膜材料進行實驗分析，再與理論預測的結果進行
比較，甚至進一步修改延伸現有的理論模式，以期發展理論模式預測的功能。本計畫可能遇到
的困難主要為溶液性質之量測與解釋，其因應之道，分列於下： 
 
(1)、溶液物性—流變特性之鑑定：因高分子溶液可能具有黏彈性，本實驗室並無合適的流變
儀進行精確流變特性的量測，本計畫可能請求工研院材化所的相關部門提供量測上的協助。對
於數據之解釋，本計畫將請澳洲Monash 大學的榮譽教授林貽清博士(Carlos Tiu)協助，林教授
為知名之流變學專家，與本實驗室有長期合作的關係。

折射剝離及膨脹之論文四篇，摘要如下，本文則列於附件： 
 
附件一、  
    Drying-induced birefringence of polyimide film was investigated. The polyimide solutions were 
coated and dried on two different types of substrates and then removed for optical measurements. 
The operating window, which was a region for stable and uniform film formation, was determined 
experimentally. The out-of-plane birefringence (OPBR) was found to increase with decreasing dry 
film thickness, and the increase became more significant for films less than 10 lm thick. The 
experimental OPBR results were compared with the predictions of two theoretical models. The 
results agreed reasonably well with the one-dimensional model of Lei et al. (J Appl Polym Sci. 
2001;81:1000-1013). On the other hand, a simple viscoelastic model, which is an extension of the 
elastic model of Croll (J Appl Polym Sci. 1979;23:847-858), could provide clear physical insight, but 
its applicability was somewhat limited. The effects of several variables such as elasticity number, 
solidification concentration, yield stress, and mass transfer rate on OPBR were examined. 
附件二、  
    The peeling behavior of polyimide film coated on steel substrates was experimentally 
investigated and compared with existing models. An operating window for peeling, which is defined 
as a closed domain for steady and defect-free peeling, is presented in terms of peeling force versus 
residual solvent content. The window is bounded by two major defects: the film becomes too brittle 
for peeling at high peeling force, and stick-slip striation defect appears at low peeling force. There 
exists a critical residual solvent content below which the adhesion between the polyimide film and 
the substrate is too strong and then peeling is impossible. Existing models for predicting steady 
peeling and the onset of peeling defects have been modified and applied to setup the boundaries of 
the operating window. There also exists another operating window for drying of polyimide and is 
presented in the form of drying temperature versus film thickness. 
附件三、  
    An operating window, which is bounded by two temperatures and draw ratios, defines the stable 
and defect-free stretching region of a polymer film. Physical properties including the coefficient of 
thermal expansion (CTE), birefringence, and Young’s modulus of a recyclable polyimide (PIR) film 
were measured under stretching conditions. While values of birefringence and Young’s modulus 
increased with increasing stretching stress in the machine direction, the CTE was found to decrease. 
A semiempirical model for the prediction of birefringence and Young’s modulus under stretching 
conditions was developed, from which the CTE could be estimated from the Young’s modulus data. 
Theoretically evaluated physical properties were found to be in qualitative agreement with the 
experimental data.

the belt. During the drying process, the volume of the coated
ﬁlm may shrink due to solvent evaporation. Crystallization,
crosslinking, and phase separation may also appear in the
process. The volume shrinkage should be isotropic without
substrate sticking, but the adhesion between the belt and the
polyimide ﬁlm restricts the horizontal movement of solidi-
ﬁed coated ﬁlm. Accordingly, this volume shrinkage will
induce an in-plane stress development.
From a microscopic point of view, the asymmetric shrink-
age of coatings implies the appearance of polymer orienta-
tion on the ﬁlm plane. This in-plane orientation induces an
out-of-plane birefringence (OPBR). Figure 1 shows the coor-
dinate system of the coating ﬁlm. Following Greener and
Chen6 the OPBR is deﬁned as,
DnOP  nz  1
2
nx þ ny
 
(1)
and the in-plane birefringence (IPBR) as,
DnIP  nx  ny (2)
where ni is the refractive index in the i direction. The polymer
has no orientation in the xy-plane because of the symmetric
strain developed during drying. Hence, the development of
IPBR is nearly zero after drying. On the other hand, the OPBR
is proportional to the drying-induced stress6,7:
DnOP ¼ C r; (3)
where r is the in-plane stress, and C is the stress-optical
coefficient of the material. If an optical film has an OPBR,
then a phase retardation in the thickness direction, Rth, will
appear when a light beam passes through the film. This phase
retardation is related to the OPBR according to the following
equation8:
Rth ¼ DnOP  l (4)
where l is the film thickness. In a LCD panel, phase retardation
appears when light passes through the liquid crystal. The
appearance of phase retardation will reduce the wide-viewing
angle and causes the deterioration of the display image. A
compensation film made from the soluble polyimide will
create the necessary birefringence to offset this phase
retardation caused by the liquid crystal, thus, minimizing the
phase retardation of the whole LCD panel.5 Therefore, it is
important to control and manipulate the OPBR of polyimide
compensation films for different types and arrangements of
liquid crystals.
Control of OPBR of polyimide ﬁlms can be executed by
modifying the molecular structure or manipulating the drying
process. The drying-stress induced birefringence was dis-
cussed by several investigators previously; in 1972, Sosnowski
and Weber9 discovered that the stress developed in the coated
ﬁlm during drying would cause the polymer to lie on the coat-
ing plane, resulting in an induction of birefringence. They also
found that the birefringence could be reduced by baking the
coated ﬁlms. Prest and Luca10 observed that the birefringence
was dependent upon the orientation of the dominating polariz-
able group, and found that ﬂexible polymer chains could be
helpful in the stress relaxation of the drying ﬁlm. The effect of
birefringence was found to be more signiﬁcant when the ﬁlm
was thinner. Later, Prest and Luca,11 Cohen and Reich,12 and
Machell et al.8 studied the effects of coating thickness, drying
temperature, polymer concentration, and molecular weight on
the drying-stress induced birefringence. All of their ﬁndings
were interpreted in terms of a competition between the planar
orientation induced by the drying process and the random con-
formation driven by thermodynamic equilibrium.
To evaluate OPBR, it is necessary to determine the drying-
induced stress accurately. Croll13 developed a simple elastic
model to predict the stress. This model is applicable to a
purely elastic coating ﬁlm, but it fails when plastic deforma-
tion is not negligible. Lei and coworkers14,15 proposed a more
realistic one-dimensional model to predict the drying-induced
stress with both elastic and plastic deformations included.
Later Lei et al.16 extended the model from one- to two-dimen-
sional by including the boundary effects. Greener and Chen6
showed that the formation of OPBR occurred when the solvent
concentration was below a critical value cs , where the stress
started to build up and induce molecular orientation. However,
when the solvent concentration dropped below the solidiﬁca-
tion concentration cs , polymer chains would no longer move
and the formation of OPBR would cease. They also used the
two drying-stress models developed by Croll13 and Lei et al.14
to calculate the birefringence, and found the predictions based
on the latter model were in better agreement with the experi-
mental data of a polystyrene/toluene system.
Soluble polyimide is an expensive material, and control-
ling the OPBR is a critical operating parameter for optical
application. The evaluation of OPBR is solely based on a te-
dious trial-and-error approach, which would be costly and
inefﬁcient. Hence, a good theoretical model for the predic-
tion of OPBR would be highly desirable.
In this study, the drying-stress induced birefringence of
soluble polyimide ﬁlms is experimentally and theoretically
investigated. To predict the OPBR after drying, a new sim-
ple viscoelastic model, modiﬁed from the elastic model of
Croll,13 is developed. In addition, the stress model developed
by Lei et al.14 is also used to compare with the experimental
results. The stress model developed by Lei et al.14 has been
found to work for certain polymer systems,7 but has never
been tested for soluble polyimide systems.

The two theoretical models used to compare with the
experimental results in this study are described below. The

equations, it is assumed that the physical properties of the
soluble polyimide: kg, hg, D, H, G, k, C^p, and q are functions
of temperature. Accurate predictions of the two models are
highly dependent on reliable, meaningful and realistic physi-
cal properties, and various parameters in the models as listed
in Table 2. Overall, 17 properties and parameters need to be

Experimental
Materials
The soluble polyimide was prepared following a patented
formulation.5 Monomers of diamine and dianhydride were
added to a solvent under nitrogen atmosphere at the reﬂux
temperature, and polyimide was formed by a polycondensa-
tion reaction. The weight-average molecular weight Mw and
the number-average molecular Mn were measured with gel
permeation chromatography by dissolving polyimide in
N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The value of Mw was found
to be around 50,000 with a polydispersity index of around 3.
The higher molecular weight polymers have been found to
hinder stress relaxation during drying, which could cause an
increase in OPBR.11 As the present research was focused on
the effects of processing variables on OPBR, the effect of
molecular weight was not investigated further. The test solu-
tion was prepared by dissolving 
15 wt % of the polyimide
in cyclopentanone solvent. Cyclopentanone (Aldrich) has a
molecular weight of 84.12 g/mol, speciﬁc gravity of 0.95
(25C), and melting and boiling point of 51.5C and
131.15C, respectively. The polyimide solution was hand-
coated on two different types of substrates (PET and glass),
and then baked in an oven. The dry ﬁlm was removed from
the substrate for optical measurement.
The poly(ethylene) terephthalate (PET) ﬁlm was manufac-
tured by Toyobo (Code. A4100). It has a speciﬁc gravity
qsub of 1.34, glass transition temperature of 76C, crystalliza-
tion temperature of between 130 and 140C, thermal conduc-
tivity of 0.218 W/mK, and heat capacity C^subp of 1130 J/kg
K. The ﬁlm thickness lsub of 188 lm was cut into A4 sizes
for experimental purpose. The glass substrate was provided
by Wei-Yen (Taiwan). The thickness lsub is 700 lm, speciﬁc
gravity qsub is 2.6, thermal conductivity is 1.05 W/mK, and
heat capacity C^subp is 880 J/kg K.
Measurements of physical properties
The rheological properties of polyimide solutions were
obtained using a TA Rheometrics Fluid Spectrometer RFS2
equipped with a concentric-cylinder sensor at low shear
rates. The dry ﬁlm thickness was determined by a VIS 4-120
optical thickness-measuring instrument (ETA-Optic). Retar-
dation and OPBR were detected by a 21ADH birefringence
analysis instrument (Kobra). The glass transition temperature
of polyimide Tg2 was measured by a DSC7 differential scan-
ning calorimetry (Perkin Elmer). The amount of residual sol-
vent was measured by a Q500 thermogravimetry analysis
(TGA) device (TA Instruments). Young’s modulus and
yielding point of optical ﬁlms were measured by a QC-
503B1 Tensile Testing Machine (Cometech).
Experimental procedure
The experimental procedure involved six major stages
described below.
(1) Solution preparation and coating: The polyimide solu-
tion was prepared and hand-coated to an approximate size of
15  25 cm2 on a selected substrate by a laboratory blade
coater.
(2) Drying: The coated ﬁlm together with the substrate
was dried in a DH-600 oven (YSC) for around 5–10 min,
over a temperature range of 40C to 120C.
(3) Peeling: The dried coating ﬁlm had to be removed by
peeling immediately after solidiﬁcation under the condition
/s \ /s . The timing of the removal was critical since the
ﬁlm would be too sticky for peeling if under-dried, and the
adhesion between the ﬁlm and the substrate would be too
strong if over-dried.
(4) Baking: The peeled ﬁlm was returned to the oven
for further drying, until the residual solvent was less than
3 wt %.
(5) Thickness measurement: Once the ﬁlm was removed
from the oven, the quality of the ﬁlm was visually examined.
If there were no defects, then the ﬁlm thickness was meas-
ured. Each data point reported represents an average value
of ﬁve measurements.
(6) Measurements of optical properties: After a piece of
dry ﬁlm of around 15  25 cm2 in size was peeled from the
substrate, birefringence was measured at ﬁve locations on
the sample, with ﬁve measurements at each location and the
average value taken.
Results and Discussion
The solution viscosity was assumed to depend exponen-
tially on solvent concentration and temperature by the equa-
tion:
l ¼ O /sð ÞQ Tð Þ ¼ c1 exp a1/sð Þ: exp b1=Tð Þ (42)
The coefﬁcients a1, b1, and c1 were evaluated by least-
square ﬁttings, and found to be a1 ¼ 36.69, b1 ¼ 4553, and
c1 ¼ 3.975  106 (GPa	s), with a conﬁdence level of R2 ¼
0.988. The ﬁtting is valid for 0.80\ /s\ 0.96 and 20\ T
\ 80 (C).
Figure 2 shows the plot of the shear modulus G against
the solvent volume fraction /s. The lowest value of G was
measured at a solvent volume fraction /s ¼ 0.28. Above this
concentration, the sample became too ﬂuid-like, and no
meaningful G data could be obtained with the existing ten-
sile testing machine. The shear modulus would drop sharply
and approached zero when the solution concentration
reached its stress built-up concentration /s .
15 For the poly-
imide solution, the stress built-up concentration was found to
be /s ¼ 0.39. This end-point condition was selected for the

the polymer skin to buckle and form a corrugated surface.33
The second mechanism suggested that the corrugation pat-
terns were the result of an evolution of Raleigh-Bernard or
Be´nard-Marangoni convective instabilities.34 It is thought
that the ‘‘orange peel’’ observed in this study is due to the
ﬁrst mechanism because it is unlikely for the Marangoni
effect to appear under the condition of slow heat transfer
through a thick glass substrate.
Comparisons between the theoretical predictions of Model
B and the experimental results of OPBR as a function of dry
ﬁlm thickness, over several drying temperatures, are dis-
played in Figures 6 and 7 for the PET and glass substrates,
respectively. Both the theoretical predictions and experimen-
tal results indicate that OPBR increases with decreasing dry-
ing thickness. Within the experimental uncertainty, there is
little variation of OPBR with the drying temperature, as sim-
ilarly predicted from Model B. On the other hand, the
observed OPBR increases more rapidly below a ﬁlm thick-
ness of 10 lm for both substrates. The theoretical predictions
appear to be closer to the experimental ﬁndings for the glass
substrate than the PET substrate. Machell et al.8 reported the
experimental ﬁndings on the effect of surface energy, and
showed that the lower the surface energy for a substrate, the
smaller the OPBR. The effect of lowering the surface energy
of the substrate is similar to an early removal of the ﬁlm
from the substrate. The present results show that the PET
substrate, which has a lower surface energy, produces a
smaller OPBR for the same ﬁlm thickness as compared to
the glass substrate. This ﬁnding is consistent with the results
of Machell et al.8 Model B assumes that materials move
only in the z-direction and not on the xy-plane, which is
expected for a substrate with a high surface energy. There-
fore, Model B is more accurate in predicting the OPBR for
the glass substrate, which has a higher surface energy than
the PET substrate.
As conﬁrmed in Figures 6 and 7 above, Model B is con-
sidered to be more accurate for the prediction of OPBR as a
function of ﬁlm thickness. This model is used as a basis to
check the validity of Model A. Figure 8 compares the pre-
dictions of the two models without the experimental results.
Model A predicts that OPBR is independent of the ﬁlm
thickness until the ﬁlm thickness drops below a critical
thickness (around 3–4 lm), below which the OPBR
increases rapidly. This prediction is similar to the prediction
of Model B in which OPBR continues to decrease slowly
throughout the experimental range of ﬁlm thickness. How-
ever, Model A predicts a slight increase in OPBR with
decreasing drying temperature, whereas the temperature
effect is not evident in the Model B prediction.
Although the prediction of Model A is not as accurate as
Model B, it may still provide a meaningful physical interpre-
tation of the drying mechanism. The model predicts that the
residual stress r or OPBR is dependent on four physical pa-
rameters: kg, D, E, and l. As seen in Eq. 7, when the wet
ﬁlm thickness is increased, the drying time required for
/s ¼ /s to reach /s ¼ /s also increases owing to the
higher value of Sh*. Equation 10 predicts that a longer dry-
ing time causes more stress relaxation and reduces the
OPBR until the stress reaches the yield strength, beyond
which it remains unchanged. On the other hand, a higher

shows a sharp increase in OPBR only when the dry ﬁlm
thickness is less than 7 lm. Since Model A assumes the dry-
ing ﬁlm behaves as a homogeneous viscoelastic material, it
cannot predict accurate OPBR under rapid drying conditions,
due to the development of high concentration gradient inside
the ﬁlm. It can be seen from Figure 12 that OPBR can be
adjusted effectively by manipulating the external mass trans-
fer rate kg and the ﬁlm thickness l. For example, if one
desires to make a polyimide ﬁlm with OPBR  0.02 and a
ﬁlm thickness of 20 lm, it can be achieved by ﬁxing the
value of kg at around 0.003.
The limiting values of OPBR for the soluble polyimide
ﬁlm as predicted by Model B are 0.035 and 0.011 for zero
and inﬁnite dry ﬁlm thickness, respectively. In practice, the
maximum wet ﬁlm thickness is limited by the operating win-
dow. Values for the maximum wet ﬁlm thickness found in
Figures 5 and 6 are about 220 lm and 320 lm for the glass
and the PET substrates, respectively. The maximum phase
retardation for PET and glass substrates as computed from
Eq. 4, using a volume fraction of the soluble polyimide of
0.12, are 660.5 nm and 514.8 nm, respectively.
Conclusions
The OPBR of a soluble polyimide ﬁlm obtained on PET
and glass substrates was theoretically and experimentally
investigated.
The drying experiment revealed that the OPBR of a solu-
ble polyimide increases slowly as dry ﬁlm thickness
decreases until a critical ﬁlm thickness of around 10 lm is
reached, below which it increases rapidly.
Two theoretical models for the prediction of OPBR were
presented and compared with the experimental results.
Model A is an extension of the model developed by Croll,13
Model B is the model developed by Lei et al.14 Physical pa-
rameters of soluble polyimide were evaluated for these two
models. Although Model B was found to agree better with
the experimental results, Model A is easier to use, and also
provides some valuable physical insights on the formation
mechanism of OPBR.
The effects of the elasticity number NEl, dimensionless
yield stress j, solidiﬁcation volume fraction /s , and exter-
nal mass transfer rate kg were also investigated by the two
models. Model A provided acceptable predictions except for
cases with rapid drying rate and large ﬁlm thickness varia-
tions after stress build-up. Although the limiting values of
OPBR as dry ﬁlm thickness approaches either zero or inﬁn-
ity are predictable from Model B, the actual maximum dry
ﬁlm thickness is limited by the operating window, as pre-
sented in Figures 3 and 4. The OPBR of polyimide ﬁlm can
be effectively controlled by adjusting the external mass
transfer rate kg and the ﬁlm thickness l.

The peeling behavior of polyimide ﬁlm coated on steel
substrates was experimentally investigated and com-
pared with existing models. An operating window for
peeling, which is deﬁned as a closed domain for
steady and defect-free peeling, is presented in terms
of peeling force versus residual solvent content. The
window is bounded by two major defects: the ﬁlm
becomes too brittle for peeling at high peeling force,
and stick-slip striation defect appears at low peeling
force. There exists a critical residual solvent content
below which the adhesion between the polyimide ﬁlm
and the substrate is too strong and then peeling is
impossible. Existing models for predicting steady peel-
ing and the onset of peeling defects have been
modiﬁed and applied to setup the boundaries of the
operating window. There also exists another operating
window for drying of polyimide and is presented in
the form of drying temperature versus ﬁlm thickness.

INTRODUCTION
Polyimide is a polymeric material consisting of mainly
aromatic rings with imide groups. Owing to its special
structure, polyimide has superior thermal, mechanical,
chemical, and electronic properties and also provides
strong resistance for moisture absorption [1, 2]. Polyimide
has wide applications in aerospace, military, optical, and
electronic industries. This study is focused on the peeling
window of a novel polyimide ﬁlm that has great potential
application for ﬂexible printed circuit industry.
The solvent casting process has served as a vital and
efﬁcient tool for the production of many important poly-
mer thin ﬁlms, such as cellulose triacetate, polycarbon-
ates, and polyethersulfone, for advanced electronic and
optical applications [3]. Polyimide thin ﬁlm is also made
by the solvent casting process. To make polyimide thin
ﬁlm, polyimide is ﬁrst dissolved in a solvent and depos-
ited on a moving steel belt. The deposited wet ﬁlm is then
passed through an oven for drying. Once the residual sol-
vent content is low enough, the polyimide ﬁlm can be
peeled off from the steel belt. The peeled ﬁlm is then
stretched in the cross direction, dried, and wound into the
ﬁnal product [4–7]. One of the key issues for the solvent
casting of polyimide ﬁlm is that the ﬁlm must be peeled
from the steel belt smoothly and defect-free. Several
physical and chemical approaches have been proposed to
improve the peeling process, including the using of water
bath or air jet [8]. Release agent such as hydroﬂuoric acid
was also considered [9]. All of these approaches may add
capital investment or may deteriorate the quality of the
polyimide ﬁlm.
The research on polymer ﬁlm peeling in open literature
can be divided into two categories. One aims at improv-
ing the peeling quality by modifying the composition or
the processing conditions of polymeric materials. There
was not much theoretical analysis involved in this
category. The other category involves mainly theoretical
analysis of peeling behavior based on force and energy

the adhesion of polyimide materials. Gent and Lai [12]
considered the degree of crosslinking, different types of
additives and substrates with different surface characteris-

Perera [27, 28] and Georgiou [42] proposed that the
total energy input per unit area required to peel the ﬁlm,
deﬁned as G : P(1  cos y), G has the same unit as
P and is balanced by three types of energy, or
G  g bþWpd; (1)
where g is the interfacial work of adhesion, b is the elas-
tic energy due to the stored strain energy in the bonded
adhesive layer, and Wpd is the work expended in plastic
deformation. Perera [27, 28] explained that Eq. 1 is appli-
cable for most organic coatings, Wpd cannot be neglected
if the coating is viscoelastic. g, b, and Wpd are deﬁned,
respectively, as follows [29–31]:

any defects. A good sample must have a smooth sur-
face and without any visible defects such as blisters,
cracks, and craters.
5. The good quality sample was prepared at a controlled
environment of 258C and RH 50% for peeling test, fol-
lowing the procedure adopted by Hu and Chen [13,
14]. The sample was cut into a long stripe (15 cm)
with a width of around 1 cm. A sharp steel scalpel
was used to cut the interface between the polyimide
ﬁlm and the steel plate, and then one end of the polyi-
mide stripe was pulled up slowly. The ﬁlm thickness
was measured by the ﬁlm thickness detector
(ID-C112MB, Mitutoyo).
6. The stripe sample was clamped to a Shimadzu (AG-
5000A, Shimadzu) machine for peeling test.
7. A ﬂow visualization device as shown is Fig. 3 was
setup to observe the critical peeling angle during the
peeling test. Spontaneous detachment would occur if
the ﬁlm was thick enough. The method proposed by
Perara [28] and Croll [31] was adopted for the evalua-
tion of peeling angle.
8. The quality of the peeling ﬁlm was observed during
the test. The ﬁlm surface roughness was measured and
quantiﬁed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM,
JSM-5600, JEOL). Other parameters such as the resid-
ual solvent content and glass transition temperature of
coated ﬁlm were separately measured.
Several physical properties of the polyimide solutions
and the coated sample stripes had to be measured
for the theoretical analysis. The viscosity data of the
polyimide solutions were obtained by a parallel-plate
rheometer (ARES, Rheometrics) at low shear rates. The
relaxation time was evaluated at high shear rates, owing
to fast stress relaxation during the peeling test. The aver-
age molecular weight Mp was evaluated by a Waters
chromatography unit interfaced with a Waters 2414
refractive index detector (Waters) using Styragel
columns with NMP as the eluent at a ﬂow rate of
1 mL/min. The calibration was based on a narrow distri-
bution polystyrene standard.
The glass transition temperature was evaluated using a
differential scanning calorimetry by a DSC7 machine
(Perkin Elmer). The residual solvent contents of the sam-
ples were measured by means of thermogravimetry analy-
sis by a TGA7 machine (Perkin Elmer).
The Young’s modulus, yielding strength, and peeling
force of a sample stripe were determined by a Shimadzu
peeling test machine (AG-5000A, Shimadzu). The maxi-
mum crosshead velocity of the machine is 500 mm/min.
The peeling forces were measured and recorded at differ-
ent crosshead velocities.
The coefﬁcient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the dry
polyimide ﬁlm was determined through thermal machine
analysis (TMA) with a Q400 TMA machine (TA Co.).
Values of CTE of steel plate and NMP were obtained
from the literature [53, 54].
The CTE of the polyimide ﬁlm with residual solvent
was estimated as
aTF ¼ jmsaTSO þ 1 jmsð ÞaTPO; (21)
where aTSO is the CTE of NMP and a
T
PO is the CTE of
polyimide.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The values of parameters required for the theoretical
calculations are listed in Table 1. The values of critical
peel angle y0 for samples with different residual solvent
contents were evaluated from the visualization experi-
ment, and the results are presented in Fig. 4. It appears

drying temperature, the peeling force increases with
decreasing ﬁlm thickness, which is consistent with the
predictions in Eqs. 6b and 7b. Also, at constant solvent
content and ﬁlm thickness, the required peeling force
increases with decreasing drying temperature. Equations
6b and 7b also predict an increase in the thermal strain
when the drying temperature decreases, resulting in an
increase of peeling force.
Comparisons between the model predictions and the
experimental peeling forces are shown in Figs. 8 and 9.
The agreement appears to be reasonably good, especially
for the two low drying temperature cases, such as Fig. 9.
At lower drying temperature of 1208C, the time requires
to dry a wet ﬁlm to reach a certain residual solvent con-
tent would be much longer than that the case when the
drying temperature is at 1808C. It is expected that at low
temperature drying, the stress distribution inside the polyi-
mide ﬁlm is more uniform, which results in a better
match with the theoretical assumptions.
The operating windows for peeling can also be pre-
sented as the peeling force versus residual solvent con-
tent. The operating windows presented in Figs. 10 and 11
are bounded by several lines and curves; Line A corre-
sponds to the solidiﬁcation point at a critical residual sol-
vent content, which is 16.5 wt% for all the cases under
investigation. However, the actual peeling was carried out
at a lower solvent content to reduce the drying load dur-
ing the poststage operations. Line B corresponds to the
critical condition for ﬁlm breaking, as determined from
Eq. 13. Curve C is the theoretical prediction for the
occurrence of the stick-slip phenomenon from the modi-
ﬁed model of Furukawa [32] or Eq. 8. Line D refers to a
critical residual solvent content, where peeling becomes
impossible because of the strong adhesion between the
polyimide ﬁlm and the steel substrate. This line is deter-
mined as the intersection of Line B with the extrapolated
curve, which represents the steady peeling force in Figs. 8
and 9. The experimental results show that within the oper-
ating window, the required steady peeling force increases
as the residual solvent content goes down until a critical
concentration is reached Line D, below which the ﬁlm is
too brittle to be removed smoothly. Note that there are no
experimental data points in the upper right regions of the
four windows, owing to the limitation of the peeling de-
vice used in the experiment. The data in Figs. 6 and 7
indicate that the steady peeling force is related to the
crosshead velocity applied in the experiment. As the max-
imum crosshead velocity is only 500 mm/min, the corre-
sponding peeling force is also limited for the polyimide
ﬁlm under investigation. In practice, the residual solvent
content should be as low as possible to reduce the load of
postdrying treatment after peeling, so the operating point
should be close to Line D in Figs. 10 and 11.
Figure 12a and b shows the SEM images of two
polyimide ﬁlms obtained under different experimental
conditions. It is observed that irrespective of the drying

The yield point of each polyimide ﬁlm sample was
measured as a function of residual solvent content at dif-
ferent drying temperature and ﬁlm thickness, as presented
in Fig. 15. The yield strength here is deﬁned as the
peeling force P at yield point. Intuitively, one may expect
that yield strength will continue to increase with decreas-
ing residual solvent content. However, the experimental
results show that the yield value appears to reach a maxi-
mum at around 8–9 wt% residual solvent content and then
decreases slightly at lower solvent content. This phenom-
enon could be explained from the competing effects of
the two mechanical properties, peel stress O and Young’s
modulus E, present in the deﬁnition of the peeling force,
P  X2t
6E . The magnitudes of these two properties will
determine the effect of residual solvent content on yield
strength. Figure 16a and b displays the experimental data
of O and E measured as a function of residual solvent
content. It is observed in Fig. 16a that O increases rapidly
with decreasing residual solvent content until it reaches
the critical concentration of about 9 wt%, and then levels
off with further decrease in solvent content. On the other
hand, Young’s modulus increases linearly as the residual
solvent decreases below 14 wt%, as shown in Fig. 16b.
Therefore, in the region above the curve in Fig. 15, the
yield strength is dominated by plastic deformation,
whereas in the region below the curve in Fig. 15, it is
dominated by elastic deformation. The experimental
results appear to fall into two distinct groups; one for the
28-lm ﬁlms and the other for the 15-lm ﬁlms. The yield
strengths for the thicker ﬁlms are much stronger
than those of the thinner ﬁlms, regardless of the drying
temperature. Within the experimental uncertainties, it is
difﬁcult to separate the drying temperature effect on the
yield strength. It is noted that for all the cases under
investigation, yield points appear at relatively low peeling
forces, which implies that most of the peeling operations
took place in the plastic region.

ABSTRACT: An operating window, which is bounded by
two temperatures and draw ratios, defines the stable and
defect-free stretching region of a polymer film. Physical prop-
erties including the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE),
birefringence, and Young’s modulus of a recyclable polyi-
mide (PIR) film were measured under stretching conditions.
While values of birefringence and Young’s modulus
increased with increasing stretching stress in the machine
direction, the CTE was found to decrease. A semiempirical
model for the prediction of birefringence and Young’s modu-
lus under stretching conditions was developed, from which
the CTE could be estimated from the Young’s modulus data.
Theoretically evaluated physical properties were found to be
in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. VC 2011

INTRODUCTION
Polyimide (PI) has been extensively applied in opti-
cal-electronic and other industries, owing to its supe-
rior thermal and mechanical properties. In recent
years, the use of recyclable polyimide has received
wide attention because of environmental considera-
tions.1,2 PIR is first produced in solution form by
first adding soft segments or side chains of different
materials to the main chain, to make it soluble in
certain solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) or dimethylacetamide (DMAC). The solution
is then coated on substrates at room temperature,
and the PIR film is produced after drying. The PIR
film produced can also be laminated with other
materials. The addition of soft segments or side
chains such as long alkyl chains onto the PI main
chain or alkyl side chains onto the phenylene rings
of the PI chain will inevitably change the thermal
and mechanical properties of the product.3–5 For
example, the PIR tends to have a higher value of the
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). This could
lead to de-lamination or curling between the PIR
films and substrates such as copper foils. A conven-
tional approach to reduce the CTE of PI materials is
surface modification by introducing hard segment
molecules; for example, biphenyltetracarboxylic acid
or benzene rings can be fused at para-positions into
the main chains. The addition of inorganic nano-par-
ticles into the PI material is another approach.6 Phys-
ical methods such as sand blasting or flame, corona
and UV rays’ treatments were also considered by
various researchers.6–15 However, the main disad-
vantage of using the above approaches is that the
resulting PI materials are in general brittle, which
will be more difficult for processing.8,16–18
A conventional way of improving the mechanical
properties of polymer films is by stretching. A poly-
mer film can be uni-axially or bi-axially stretched to
change the orientations of molecules. Most research
efforts have been focusing on uni-axial stretching, as
it is harder to perform the experiments on bi-axial
stretching. Some experimental results were reported
on the CTE of certain polymers,19,20 but the theoreti-
cal analyses are very limited in open literature. Sato
et al.21 made an attempt to simulate the molecular
orientation, including its relaxation, during the
stretching of cycloolefin copolymer films. Hibi
et al.22 proposed an ideal aggregation model to pre-
dict the birefringence and Young’s modulus of
unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). To date,
there appears to be no theoretical prediction of phys-
ical properties of stretching PI film in the literature.
Several researchers have presented experimental
observations on the effect of stretching on physical
properties of various polymers other than PI.

To date, there is no theoretical formula relating
the Young modulus to the CTE of a polymeric mate-
rial. However, there were some experimental data
presented for various polymers such as acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate (PC), and
others37 in the form of CTE as a function of Young’s
modulus. This is the second set of data required for
the present approach, as displayed in Figure 2. Fig-
ure 2 presents the literature data for different types
of polyimides,43–46 as well as the PI films used in the
present study, plotted in the form of CTE versus
Young’s modulus. It appears that there is a correla-
tion between CTE and the Young modulus, and a
master curve can be constructed by a least-square
fitting procedure. This curve can be used to deter-
mine the CTE from the Young’s modulus of a PI
sample. When Em and Et are available, values of
CTE in the stretching and transverse directions, MD
and TD, can be evaluated with the aid of Figure 2.37
The advantage of the proposed approach is that
once an operating temperature is fixed, and a suita-
ble draw ratio is selected, the related stress can be
readily obtained using the formulas presented
above. Consequently, values of birefringence,
Young’s modulus, and CTE can be evaluated with-
out experimentation.
EXPERIMENTAL
The procedure for preparing the PIR was described
previously by Wang et al.,47 which was based on a
patented formulation.48 The polymerization was
carried out in one-step chemical imidization. Bis(tri-
mellitic acid anhydride)phenyl ester 45.8 g (0.1 mol),
1-(4-aminophenoxy)-4-(4-aminophenyl)-2,6-di-tert-
butyl-benzene 38.8 g (0.1 mol), and NMP(270 g)/xy-
lene(68 g) cosolvent were mixed at a temperature
273–277 K for about 4 h in a nitrogen environment.
The mixture was then heated to 453–473 K, and sub-
jected to dehydration reaction at that temperature
for 3 h. The PIR obtained has an intrinsic viscosity
of 0.8 dL g1 (NMP, 0.5 dL g1, 303 K), and a molec-
ular weight between 30,000 and 40,000 g mol1
(MW). The glass transition temperature is around
578 K, and its specific gravity is 1.4. The PIR was
dissolved in N-methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (NMP), with an
initial solid content of 14.6 wt %. The viscosity of
the PIR solution was around 5000 mPas. For the
stretching experiments, the PIR solution had to be
hand-coated on a flat steel plate, then peeled and
dried. The detailed procedures: for the film prepara-
tion are as follows:
1. A highly polished steel plate with surface
roughness less than 1 lm was first cleaned
using a nitrogen spray gun to remove dusts,
then wiped by acetone. The plate was then
immersed into an ultrasonic DI water bath
(DC300H, Delta) for 20 min. The plate was
wiped by paper and then cleaned again with
the nitrogen spray gun.
2. The PIR solution was placed in a mixer (ARE-
250, YSC) with steady stirring and de-gassing
for 20 min. The solution was then coated on
the steel plate by a laboratory blade coating
system.
3. The steel plate with the coated film was placed
in an oven for drying. The drying temperature
was set at 393 K and the drying time was
around 500 s.
4. According to the peeling window found by
Wang et al.,47 the PIR film could be peeled

points were taken from open literature and the present

images of the molecular orientation at the mid-neck
section and the two ends of the PIR film samples
were taken using a polarized optical microscopy
(POM) (BX51, Olympus).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Values of parameters required for the theoretical cal-
culations are listed in Table I. All the parameters
were determined experimentally. The average film
thickness is about 18 lm. In carrying out the stretch-
ing experiments, a temperature range suitable for
stretching must be decided first. Observations on the
variation of Young’s modulus as a function of tem-
perature can serve as an indicator to determine the
operable temperature range.20 Values of Young’s
modulus obtained for various PIR samples as a func-
tion of temperature are displayed in Figure 3. It is
observed that Young’s modulus is independent of
temperature in the low temperature range up to T ¼
573 K. The Young modulus then drops sharply as
the temperature rises from 573 to 613 K. It reaches a
minimum at around 613 K, and increases again with
further increase in temperature. According to Shir-
ouzu et al.,20 a sharp drop of Young’s modulus in
the temperature range between 573 and 613 K indi-
cates a structural change from the glassy to rubbery
state, where the strength of the structure is weak-
ened. When the temperature exceeds 613 K, strain
hardening is likely to appear and the strength of PIR
is enhanced. It is easier to carry out stretching
experiment in the temperature range between 573
and 613 K because the stress required to stretch the
sample is smaller, thus preventing the slippage
between the PIR film and the holder. Hence, the two
operating temperatures selected for the stretching
experiment in the present study were 583 and 608 K.
Another critical parameter for the stretching
experiment is the draw ratio. The PIR film thickness
may become nonuniform during stretching. The
nonuniformity can be either in the machine direction
(MD) or the transverse direction (TD). The variation
of film thickness d obtained as a function of draw ra-
tio is presented in Figure 4. It is observed that the
PIR films are not uniform in TD if the draw ratio is
smaller than 1.4. Increasing the stretching stress can
minimize the nonuniformity of the film. According
to Galay and Cakmak,51 the surface smoothness is
determined by the molecular structure of the film. If
the structure is strong, then the resulting surface is
smooth; and if the structure is weak, then nonuni-
form surface will appear during stretching. Higher
stretching temperature will reduce the strength of
the molecular structure and consequently increases
the possibility of surface nonuniformities. The film
surface can be smoothened by increasing the draw
ratio, owing to the higher stretching stress.
King et al.35,36 observed the appearance of necking
when the draw ratio was too high. Necking implies
a variation of physical properties of the test sample
due to the unevenness of molecular orientation.
However, necking cannot be easily identified by just
observing the appearance of samples. Photographs
of the PIR samples taken at two temperatures and
different draw ratios are shown in Figure 5. Even
though the widths of the PIR samples are smaller in

observations for both temperature and stretching
stress ranges. The discrepancies appear to be more sig-
nificant at high stretching stress. This observation was
further examined from the polarized optical micro-
scopic images (POM), which show the molecular ori-
entation patterns of samples at different draw ratios
between 1.4 and 2.7, and temperatures 583 and 608 K,
as shown in Figure 8. El-Tonsy et al.28 observed a fibril
structure of the stretched poly(propylene) sample at
the mid-point of the sample at lower k, and the struc-
ture was less regular at two end points of the sample.
The images in Figure 8 show a similar pattern. Regular
fibril structure was observed when k is less than 2.4.
At k ¼ 2.7, irregular patterns shown inside the dotted
enclosure as marked by arrows were observed at two
end points. When the draw ratio is above 2.4, mole-
cules at the mid-neck section in the stretched PI film
are regularly oriented, but not at the two ends. The
model developed here was based on the assumption
that molecular orientation would not be influenced by
imminent necking. Hence, the prediction may not be
correct if necking affects the molecular orientation.
Therefore the deviations between the predictions and
the experimental results are larger at high draw ratios.
Comparison of the theoretical predictions of
Young’s modulus Em in the MD direction with the
experimental results is displayed in Figure 9. The
trend is similar to the birefringence results shown in
Figure 7, i.e., the Young modulus increases with
increasing stretching stress due to the molecular ani-
sotropy in the stretching direction. For the same
stretching stress, Em is smaller at higher stretching
temperature, because the sample becomes more iso-
tropic. The differences of Em between the two tem-
peratures are less significant at lower stress. The the-
oretically predicted values of Em are higher than the
experimental values, with a maximum deviation of
about 10%, occurring at the draw ratio 2.7.

irregular patterns of molecular orientations.

draw ratio, from which the required stress can be
determined. A master curve can be constructed
based on the experimental data that relate Young’s
modulus to CTE for different types of PI materials
currently available in open literature. This curve can
be used to estimate the CTE of PIR from Young’s
modulus data.
Comparisons of the theoretical predictions with
the experimental data showed that the theory over-
predict the birefringence and Young’s modulus, but
under predicts the CTE at the same stretching tem-
perature and stress. This is due to the fact that the
theoretical model does not include the effect of mo-
lecular orientation. Although there are certain dis-
crepancies between the theoretical and experimental
values, the general trends of variation are similar
and qualitative agreement is obtained. Young’s mod-
ulus and CTE in the transverse direction were diffi-
cult to obtain experimentally due to sample size, but
they can also be evaluated from the model.
Valuable suggestions of Prof. Carlos Tiu,Monash University,
Australia, were highly appreciated.

 INTRODUCTION 
  Polymer films that are widely used in various industrial applications are made by three 
processing methods; the first one is melt extrusion, such as the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
films [1]. The second method is film blowing molding [2~6], such as plastic bags. The third method 
is usually called solution or solvent casting [7]. Many important polymer films that are needed for 
optical applications are made by solution casting processes. For example, polyimide (PI) films 
[8~11], triacetyl cellulose (TAC) films [12~16] are made by the solution casting processes. The 
advantages of solvent casting include that the high flatness of film uniformity can be achieved, 
polymer molecules can have isotropic arrangements, it is suitable for temperature-sensitive 
polymers and excellent optical properties and low hazes of the polymer films can be retained. There 
have been extensive studies on the extrusion and blown molding processes [1~6]. However, the 
fundamental analysis on the solution casting process appears to be rare. The earliest patent on 
solvent casting was issued to Steven and Lefferts [17] on the production of celluloid film. Kinsella 
[18] used nickel-plated band to make cellulose disacetate film through continuous solvent casting 
operations. Juergen and Siemann [19] replaced the melt extrusion process by the solvent casting 
process so that the isotropic properties of polyarylate film products can be significantly improved. 
Recently, several authors examined the optical properties of the cast TAC[20~24], PI[11,25]and 
other polymer films[26~28].Nakayama et al. [20] controlled TAC film’s in-plane birefringence and 
out-of-plane birefringence. Hamamoto et al. [28] suggested to make high tensile and elongation of

   The fluid motion in the slot exit region is similar to those in the slot die and curtain coating 
operations. Analysis on these two types of coating operations can be found in several standard 
textbooks [34~35]. However, there are two major differences; the first is that the viscosity of the 
cast solution is usually much higher than those used in slot die and curtain coating operations. 
Another difference is the gap between the slot die and the moving belt is usually larger than the gap 
for slot die coating, but smaller than the height of curtain coating operation. The edge guides to 
support the curtain usually are not required for solution casting. In the present analysis, we shall 
determine the operating window of solution casting for Newtonian fluids, we shall also apply the 
flow visualization developed previously for slot die coating [36, 37] to observe the fluid motion at 
the slot exit. Comparison of the performance of these two operations based on some previous works 
on slot die coating [36, 37] and curtain coating [37, 38] will also be presented.

 lighting source are placed close to the slot die as shown in Fig.4. Proper lighting is necessary to 
observe the two free surfaces of the flow domain clearly. The Photoshop software is necessary to 
improve the quality of the photos taken. During the flow experiment, the gap Ho between the slot 
die and the moving PET substrate was adjusted between 200 and 1000μm. The substrate speed V 
changed from 1m/min to the maximum speed 30m/min.

 postponed if the upstream die lip length Lu is increased. Fig.7. displays the effect of increasing Lu 
from 500μm to 1000μm. Initially the flow is stable as shown in Fig.7. (a) and (b) for both cases 
with Lu equal to 500μm and 1000μm, respectively. As the line speed is decreased to 
V=13.0×10-2m/s, the flow with Lu equal to 500μm becomes unstable and the upstream meniscus is 
left behind the upstream die lip as shown in Fig.7. (c), unstable pooling appears. On the other hand, 
the flow as shown in Fig.7. (d) remains stable at V=13.0×10-2m/s for the Lu=1000μm. Once an even 
lower line speed is reached, as V=8.5×10-2m/s, the flow becomes unstable as shown in Fig.7. (e). 
  The effects of two different start-up approaches on the operating windows were examined first. 
The first approach S1 is that the fluid emanating from the slot die starts to coat on the substrate at 
time t=0 with the line speed of the substrate being zero. The line speed then starts from zero and 
increases to a specified value. On the other hand, the approach S2 is that the solution starts to coat in 
the substrate only when the line speed of the substrate has already reached the specified value. S1 
and S2 are two limiting situations for industrial practice, usually the solution casting operation will 
start when the line speed is slow (but not zero), then the flow rate will increase proportionally to the 
line speed until the specified wet thickness and line speed are both reached and then the steady 
operation will continue. It was found that if the viscosity of the solution is low, or the gap is large, 
the two approaches will generate the same operating window. On the other hand, if the viscosity is 
high, or the gap is small, the operating window generated by S1 approach is much smaller than that 
generated by S2. Fig.8. presents the operating window for the cast solution with viscosity

 increases. Actually there are three distinct regions. In Region I, Vmax will go down as the fluid 
viscosity is increased until μ=250mPa·s, then Vmax in Region II will go up as the fluid viscosity 
increases until μ=450mPa·s, Vmax will go down again as the fluid viscosity is further increased in 
Region III. It is interesting to investigate why for a smaller gap Ho and in a certain range of 
viscosity, Vmax will go up instead of going down as one may generally expect. The case of the gap 
Ho=500μm was selected for detailed analysis. The photos of the flow domains between the slot exit 
and the moving substrate for the three regions are displayed in Fig.11.; it can be seen that the flow 
domain as shown in Fig.11. (a) is similar to a coating bead in slot die coating operations in Region I 
and is relatively large when compared with other two cases. A previous study [36] found that 
coating flow is more stable if the coating bead is larger. On the other hand, the sizes of the flow 
domain in Regions II and III are compatible as shown in Figs.11. (b) and (c).However, after careful 
measurement on the dynamic contact angles at point A in Regions II and III, it was found that the 
angles are close to 160°in Region III. Air entrainment would appear theoretically if the dynamic 
contact angle approaches 180°, a previous study found that the angle could be observed before air 
entrainment was 160° [40], therefore it implies that air entrainment is likely to appear in Region III. 
  The areas of the flow domain can be measured from the four corners ABCD as shown in Fig.11. 
The areas of the flow domain together with the dynamic contact angles estimated from the photos 
for Ho=500μm as a function of fluid viscosity are given in Fig.12.; it can be seen that the areas of 
the flow domain become smaller in Region I as the fluid viscosity increases and Vmax drops, the

 (5) inertial force on the moving web FIw : ρVV 
  Where V, Vs, ρ and σ are the casting velocity, slot exiting liquid velocity, density and surface 
tension, respectively. The effects of these five forces on Vmax were analyzed for three different gaps. 
It was found that Fg and FIw are rather small for the cases we studied, therefore only the other three 
forces can be relevant. Fig.14. presents the three forces calculated at Vmax for solutions with 
different viscosities. The results in Fig.14. (a) clearly indicate that only Fv and Fs are important for 
the cases with gap=200μm, therefore a capillary number Ca≡ Fv /Fs is the only relevant 
dimensionless group that will influence Vmax. The results for the gap Ho=500μm are displayed in 
Fig.14. (b), if the fluid viscosity is lower than 295mPa·s, only two forces, i.e. , FIs and Fs are 
important, therefore a Weber number We≡ FIs /Fs can represent the influence of force on Vmax. 
However as μ is higher than 295mPa·s, all the three forces are relevant, consequently in addition to 
the Weber number, capillary number Ca≡ Fv /Fs should be relevant, too. We have made attempts to 
develop some universal correlations to relate three dimensionless groups with Vmax; the results are 
inclusive because it can be seen from Fig.14. that the ratios of forces change significantly as the 
fluid viscosity varies.
