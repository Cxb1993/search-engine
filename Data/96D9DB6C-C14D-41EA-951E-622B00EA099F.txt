Abstract 
In this proposed three-year project, we intend to 
develop and systematically characterize a non-
thermal atmospheric-pressure capacitively coupled 
plasma jet (APPJ), which is able to generate reactive 
atoms or radicals of practical interest. Interested 
radicals may include oxygen- (electronegative) and 
nitrogen-based (electropositive) species, which have 
tremendous practical applications. Research 
approaches include both experiments and modelings.  
In the first two years, in the experimental part in 
the earlier stage we focusdc on examining the post-
glow fluid dynamics, plasma physics and chemistry 
by varying all kinds of test conditions. In later stage, 
we will shift our focus to study the effects of the 
discharge by pure helium, pure argon and adding 
oxygen into the helium. Mechanism of introducing 
oxygen into the discharge, how to extend the 
downstream distance of the “alive” reactive oxygen 
atoms, and increase the oxygen atoms are the three 
most important tasks. In addition to all the 
measurements in the first year, distribution of the 
species concentrations, especially the oxygen atoms, 
were measured in the post-glow region using the 
OES system.  
 
Keywords: atmospheric-pressure plasma jet, helium, 
argon, nitrogen, air, fluid modeling. 
 
一、計畫背景說明 
低壓電漿已經在表面改質及半導體製程有廣
泛的應用，其優點是在低壓環境產生大量高化學
反應活化基及離子相對傳統必須高溫環境才可產

年來常壓電漿 (atmospheric-pressure) 吸引許多人
的投入[see References in 2000-2005]因為其相對不
需如低壓電漿需要昂貴真空設備及為維護成本，
針對工業生產線需要連續線生產，常壓電漿有相
對優勢[Schutze et al., 1998; Becker et al., 2004; 
Moravej et al., 2004; 2005a; 2005b; 2006] 。但針對
電漿反應機制透過模擬及實驗相互驗證的研究團
隊，相對少之又少。所以希望透過此計畫能以射
頻電源供應器 (13.56 MHz) 常壓電漿束為研究方
向, 逐步從實驗參數測試及最佳化 (電性，光譜，
熱流場)，模擬電漿反應機制，表面改質及鍍膜應

stochastic (random) processes like the DSMC method [3], thus removing all statistical scatter 
traditionally associated with such schemes. The analytical foundation of the particle property 
calculation and zero statistical scatter allows the number of particles to be small: 3 or 4 particles are 
usually sufficient. Following the convention of other kinetic-theory founded schemes, particles are 
permitted to move unobstructed during the free flight or flux phase of the simulation resulting in a 
solver with very high locality, making the method ideal for large-scale distributed-memory and/or 
vector computing. This nature also makes the QDS method a true direction coupling numerical 
scheme, which is very difficult for the conventional finite volume methods in CFD to achieve. 
 
There are several advantages to particle-based Euler solvers.  Firstly, hybridization between the solver 
and a pure DSMC solver which is capable of simulating the non-continuum regions of flow is 
relatively simple.  Several authors have developed such particle-based hybrid methods including 
Macrossan [4], Chen [5], Smith [6] and Wu [7].  The second major advantage is that particle-based 
methods can exchange fluxes between any two cells on the grid for any given time step.  Direction 
decoupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods only allow fluxes to be exchanged between 
cells sharing a common interface. This obviously unphysical treatment often results in non-physical 
results in CFD simulations [8]. 
 
Recently, Wu’s group [9] has applied the second order reconstruction using slope limiters to reduce 
the numerical diffusion of the QDS method, which was validated using several 1D and 2D cases. Later, 
the 2D QDS method was further extended to simulate axisymmetric 2D flow by the same group [xx], 
which, to the best knowledge of the authors, is the world’s first true-direction, two-dimensional 
axisymmetric solver. Several interesting and important studies are also currently under investigation in 
Wu’s group, which include: extension to multi-species, a parallel QDS scheme using the distributed-
memory MPI library, and the even larger reduction of computational time by combing graphic 
processor units (GPUs) and distributed-memory machines. In addition, several ideas for future 
extensions of the QDS method are briefly presented, which include: 1) extension to N-th order spatial 
reconstructions to further reduce the numerical diffusion, 2) extension to viscous flow simulation 
using Chapman-Enskog distribution, 3) hybridization with the DSMC method for rarefied-continuum 
flow simulation. It is thus the objective of this paper to provide an overview the QDS method and its 
outlook as a gas flow solver. 
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The QDS method is first introduced briefly and 
then followed by its extension using the 2nd order spatial reconstruction. Several 1D and 2D gas flows 
are presented, which include 1D Sod’s problem, 2D explosion and implosion problems and 2D blast 
wave simulation. Next, its extension to simulate the axisymmetric gas flow problems are presented 
and validated by computing several 1D-radial and 2D-axisymmetric flows.  Later, two strategies in 
reducing the computational time are introduced, which include parallel computing using distributed-
memory machines and by combining GPUs and distributed-memory machines. Finally, several 
possible research directions are outlined at end of the paper. 
 
2. The QDS Method and Its Extensions

By using a Gaussian quadrature approximation, the integral of equation (1) over its limits can be 
approximated by:

where wj and qj are the weights and abscissas of the Gaussian quadrature (also known as the Gauss-
Hermite parameters).  The abscissas are the roots of the Hermite polynomials which can be found 
tabulated in reference [13] or can be defined by the recurrence equation: 
 22
theory based flow solvers. The introduction of a higher order interpolation scheme on data which is 
linearly varying (in space, in this instance) will, at best, perform no better than a linearly interpolating 
scheme. In addition, no information regarding gradients of conserved or primitive variables appears in 
either linear or higher order interpolation routines. 
 
2.2 Extension to a Second Order Scheme 
 
In order to extend the scheme to high order accuracy in a more conventional fashion, the estimates of 
flux values are improved by adjusting the particle mass, velocity and internal energy in equations (5) 
to (7) by considering the gradient values calculated at the previous time step using a second order flux 
reconstruction scheme.  Thus, as an example, the particle mass becomes: 
    
 jLi
ij
xwx
dx
d
m


 
         (14) 
where ΔxL represents the location in the cell from where the flow properties are taken.   
 
This is demonstrated in Figure 1 showing the addition of a linear variation of density within a cell. 
Since QDS is essentially a direction coupled volume-to-volume solver, conditions within a region of 
space are required.  Particles moving to a region right of the source cell are likely to have their 
properties defined by a region in the right half of the cell. In the present implementation, fluxes 
moving to the right are assumed to take their quantities from the reconstructed state ΔxL = 0.5(Δx – 
vijdt) to the right of the cell center.  This corresponds to the centre of mass of the flux which moves 
into the destination cell.  Left moving fluxes have properties constructed in a similar fashion.  Particles 
are then moved in free flight, justifying the use of a linear interpolation routine. 
 
To prevent unphysical and unstable oscillations in the solution, the gradients are calculated using slope 
limiters.  In this scheme, gradients are first determined using the MINMOD (Minimum Modulus) and 
the MC (Monotonized Central Difference) scheme [10]. Using density as an example, the gradient 
using the MC slope limiter is:

2.3 Extension to a Second Order Axisymmetric Scheme 
 
The simple method for calculating the overlap function becomes more complicated for axisymmetric 
flows. Two corrections must be applied, since cells at different radii have different volumes, even if 
their cross-sectional area is the same. The first correction is applied to the momentum of each cell to 
account for the variation in the force due to static pressure across the top and bottom interfaces of the 
cell, as shown in Figure 3. At each time step, an amount of momentum is added to each cell which is 
given by: 
     txrPM        (23) 
where P (=ρRT) is the pressure in the cell, Δr is the radial size of the cell, Δt is the simulation time 
step and the arbitrary angle α is set to π is the current implementation of the QDS code. If this 
difference is not accounted for, an artificial flow will be set up towards the axis of symmetry, even for 
flows with zero bulk radial velocity. 
 
Fig. 3:  Schematic of the forces due to static pressure P on an axisymmetric cell leading to the 
requirement for a momentum correction ΔM at every QDS time step Δt. 
 
The second correction accounts for fact that the simple overlap method described above must now be 
corrected for radial components of fluxes which will result in the mass, momentum and energy 
moving to differing cell volumes (i.e. fluxes which move away from the axis must expand into a larger 
cell volume and vice-versa).  It can be shown from Figure 4 that for a flux having radial velocity vr 
over a time step Δt, the ratio between the displaced volume Vd, having a centroid at radius r and a 
radial width Δr, to the volume where this mass originated V0 is:

Thus, for an axisymmetric simulation, radial fluxes are calculating using equations (29a) and (29b) 
while axial fluxes use equation (9). These are combined in a 2N flux formulation to obtain the fluxes 
to the eight surrounding neighbor cells.

2.4 Parallel Implementation Using Distributed-memory Machines 
 
For large scale computation using QDS, proper parallelization is necessary to reduce the runtime for a 
meaningful simulation. By applying the spatial domain decomposition method, the QDS method itself 
is perfect for parallel implementation using distributed-memory machines through MPI libraries 
because of: 1) explicit in time marching scheme and 2) highly local flux scheme inherited in the 
scheme. In the present paper, we have simply divided the computational domain by enforcing 
approximately equal number of cells in each processor. 
 
2.5 Parallel Implementation by Combining Distributed-memory Machines and GPUs 
 
GPUs have been playing very important role in gaming software design because of the high speed 
calculation due to hardware computing, and low cost due to mass production in the IT industry. 
Recently, several disciplines of scientific computing have taken advantage of this fast development, 
which include astronomy, molecular dynamics, lattice Boltzmann method, and CFD, to name a few. 
Unlike the conventional finite-volume method in CFD, the QDS method may have much larger 
potential in applying this new technique because of similar reasons as mentioned in previous sections: 
explicit in time and highly local scheme. In addition, by combining the distributed-memory machines 
and GPUs, very large reduction of computational time can be expected. However, some paradigm shift

3. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 The Second Order Extension 
 
Figure 8 illustrates the typical results of density profiles of Sod’s problem using different numerical 
schemes as compared to the analytical Riemann solution. Results clearly demonstrate that the 2nd order 
QDS using slope limiters improves the solution greatly with only minimal amount of extra 
computational cost. Figure 9 shows that simulated density profiles using different CFL numbers (0.1, 
0.5 and 1.0). Results show that the present 2nd order QDS scheme is relatively insensitive to the 
variation of CFL number less than 1.0, although the a slight bump occurs at the edge of the right-
moving shock.

and Lien [11]. 
3.2 The Second Order Axisymmetric QDS 
 
Figure 12 illustrates the comparison of results of a spherical explosion using the 2nd order 
axisymmetric QDS with other numerical schemes including the 1st order QDS and HLL. Results 
clearly show that only the 2nd order axisymmetric QDS predicts the flow reasonably because of the 
inherited true direction coupling. Even with 2nd order HLL scheme, unphysical results also appear at 
least in the early stage of the evolution. As for the 1st order QDS, it is obviously too diffusive as 
expected. 
 
Figure 13 presents a series of snapshots of density contour for the simulation of shock propagation 
through a pipe with a sudden expansion using the second order axisymmetric QDS scheme. All the 
shock and expansion waves are clearly captured along with the other complicated interaction among 
these waves. This has also been validated by the good agreement with a direct simulation assuming 
infinite collision rate, which is shown in Figure 14.

Figure 16 shows the speedups of different number of nodes, having one or two GPUs within each node, 
as compared to a CPU (Intel Xeon X572). Note the protocol for the GPU and network communication 
is CUDA (developed by NVIDIA Inc.) and MPI library, respectively. Result shows that speedup can 
reach as high as 623.9 using the combination of 16 nodes with 2 GPUs within each node. Also the 
speedup is slightly higher as the number of GPUs per node is larger for the same total number of 
GPUs.  This tremendous reduction of computational time by using the hybrid computing approach is 
very important in some practical applications such as the simulations of a realistic 3D blast wave 
propagation under the urban environment. One typical example is shown in Figure 17. More details 
shall be provided in the meeting.

Abstract 
 
An overview of the current status of the kinetic-based QDS method is presented. The recent 
progress of QDS as a Eulerian flow solver is presented, which includes: (1) a novel second order 
extension to the QDS scheme, 2) the QDS extension to axisymmetric flow - the world’s first true-
direction, two-dimensional axisymmetric solver, 3) extension to Nth order QDS scheme, 4) a parallel 
QDS scheme using the distributed-memory MPI library, and 5) the large reduction of computational 
time possible using graphic processor units (GPUs) which enable speedup approaching ~100-300 
times. At the end, several ideas for future extensions of the QDS method are briefly outlined.

1. Introduction 
 
There are a number of approaches for the simulation of gas flows and a large variety of solution 
methods depending on the nature and level of rarefaction of the flow. Computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) codes typically us a finite volume method to solve a set of discretized governing equations, 
usually the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. Contemporary finite volume CFD codes divide the 
computational domain into a grid of finite volumes and fluxes of mass, momentum and energy are 
calculated through the interfaces between these volumes. The technique suffers from the major 
disadvantage that poor alignment of the grid with the flow field results in large errors since fluxes can 
only occur between elements which share an interface. Thus, CFD requires careful grid design to 
ensure accurate results, convergence and stability. 
 
Alternative approaches take into account kinetic theory and the particle-based nature of gases in 
simulating the flow field. Recently, the Quiet Direct Simulation (QDS) method was invented by 
Albright et al. [1] as a method for modeling plasma physics. They subsequently applied QDS to the 
simulation of Eulerian fluids for Sod’s one dimensional shock tube problem and a simple two 
dimensional blast wave problem. Since then little further work has been done, the only example being 
by Peter [2] for simulating a typical diffusion equation using random time step for particle movement. 
In the QDS method, the effect of sampling using random numbers is replaced by using the weights and 
abscissas of a Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Thus, QDS is a particle- and kinetic-based Euler solver 
which exhibits negligible statistical scatter, has a large dynamic range, is easily extended to multi-
dimensions and multi-species, is computationally inexpensive, is easily implemented on parallel 
computers and, since it is a particle-based method, does not require direction decoupling like 
conventional finite volume method. The major disadvantage is the scheme is inherently very diffusive. 
Albright et al. named the technique the Quiet DSMC (QDSMC) method; however the present authors 
feel this is a misnomer as no there is no random number (or Monte Carlo) component to the algorithm 
and, unlike DSMC, it is valid only when thermal equilibrium can be assumed. 
 
The QDS method employs trial particles to carry fluxes of mass, momentum and energy in physically 
realistic directions regardless of the underlying computational grid. Particle velocities are determined 
through an analytical discretization of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution without the use of

Equation (2) becomes exact when the function f(x) is a linear combination of the 2J-1 polynomials x0, 
x1, … , x2J – 1. 
 
Thus the basic first-order one-dimensional QDS algorithm consists of three basic steps (the method 
can be readily extended to higher dimensions) [6]: 
(1)  Particles undergo a “quiet start”.  Here j = 1,…,J particles are generated on the grid point xi from 
the known grid quantities of density (ρi), velocity (ui), velocity variance (σ2vi) and energy (Ei).  The 
particles masses, velocities and internal energies are, respectively:

where x  is the uniform grid size,  is the total number of degrees of freedom (2(-1)-1) and is 
the number of simulated translation degrees of freedom (i.e. for one-dimensional simulation, .  
Any unused translational and other non-translational degrees of freedom are thus treated as internal 
structural degrees of freedom. 
(2)  Particles are advanced to their new position over a time step Δt such that: 
      tvxttx ijiij        (8) 
(3)  The grid properties are updated by linearly distributing the properties carried by the particles on to 
the grid.  The grid properties of mass, momentum and energy can be calculated from the individual 
particle mass (mP), velocity (vP) and internal energy ( P ) with:

This linear interpolation scheme is the mathematical representation of the assumption that each 
particle represents a very large number of particles with identical velocities uniformly distributed 
across the source cell. Such a scheme is inherently first order accurate in space. The interpolation 
routine implemented by Albright et al. [1] in the original QDS does no more than effectively replace 
the free flight phases of molecular motion which is an assumption present in many modern kinetic 
 23
 
The extension of the scheme to two-dimensions is relatively straight-forward; however, at this stage it 
becomes convenient to move away from the concept of a particle whose properties are interpolated 
onto a grid towards a conventional finite volume approach. In this approach, conserved quantities such 
as mass, momentum and energy are exactly conserved by tracking fluxes from source volumes to 
destination volumes. Discrete simulation particles are now considered as a very large number of 
smaller particles uniformly (or linearly) distributed over the source cell.  If the particle position 
distributions (i.e gradients of density in the flow) are known, the flux from the source region to any 
arbitrary destination volume can be calculated.  This concept is illustrated in Figure 2 for a 2D case. 
The amount of mass, momentum and energy moving from the source to the destination cell is 
proportional to the ratio of the area (or volume for 3D) of the overlap to the area of the original cell. 
This scheme requires minimal computation, works between arbitrarily sized source and destination 
cells (which makes in suitable for adaptive mesh refinement). Using this concept, the particle mass 
and velocities in equations (5) and (6) become:

where there are k = 1,…,K particles in the y-coordinate direction. 
 
The internal energy remains identical to the one dimensional case, allowing for a corresponding 
increase in to account for the extra simulated dimension.  
 
As shown in Figure 2, the fraction of mass from the source cell which fluxes to the destination cell can 
be determined by the overlap area A= vxj(new)vyj(new)dt2 divided by the source cell area dxdy for the 2D 
case. Thus the amount of mass mflux, energy Eflux and momentum in each coordinate direction px,flux and 
py,flux which must be added to the destination cell and subtracted from the source cell are given by:

These ratios can be multiplied directly to the radial components of mass, momentum and energy fluxes 
to correct for the difference in radial volumes of source and destination regions.   
Equations (24) and (25) are suitable for first order simulations; however in second order the effect of 
property gradients must be taken into account.  Figure 5 shows the radial flux from a source cell at 
radius rcell (with upper and lower boundaries rL and rR respectively) to a cell of greater radius.  Note 
here that the source cell has a centre of mass at rcm and, given there is a density gradient across the cell 
of a constant B = dρ/dr, the centre of mass is given by:

of the QDS scheme is required to suit the hardware structure of the GPUs. All the GPU codes were 
programmed through the use of CUDA, which is developed by Nvidia Inc. The modifications are 
described briefly in the following. 
 
 
 
Fig. 6: Basic algorithm of QDS computation using GPUs. 
 
The major idea of a successful GPU computation of the QDS scheme strongly relies on the possibility 
of conducting all the computations (flux calculations, flux exchange and state calculations) on the 
device after the initiation from the host, which is shown in Figure 6. This is mainly caused by the fact 
that the data exchange between device and host is very inefficient. Most important of all, since each 
cell is an independent thread on GPUs, all communications between the cells becomes inefficient 
because of the slow communication between threads.  Thus, to conduct an efficient GPU computation, 
some modification of the serial QDS scheme is necessary to avoid any possible data exchange 
between host and device. One feasible and easy way is to collect and add all incoming fluxes from 
neighbor cells (Figure 7b), rather than to store outgoing fluxes to the destination cells (Figure 7a). 
Since the Cartesian grids are used in the present QDS scheme, all incoming fluxes from all neighbor 
cells can be calculated easily and stored once the macroscopic properties of the neighbor cells are 
known.  In addition to the computation of QDS on GPUs, we have also demonstrated that it is possible 
to do the computation by combining conventional distributed-memory machines (through MPI 
libraries) and GPUs (through CUDA).

shock. 
 
Figure 10 illustrates the density contours of a two-dimensional blast wave resulting from different 
numerical schemes. It clearly shows that the 2nd order QDS scheme predicts the flow field 
symmetrically without the defect caused by the direction decoupling of the conventional finite volume 
method, such as the Riemann solver. 
 
Figure 11 shows the comparison of the snapshot of density contour at t=4.0 s for Mach 3 flow past a 
square block using the 2nd order QDS scheme with that obtained earlier by Keats and Lien [11], who 
have applied adaptive mesh refinement.

3.3 Parallel Implementation of the QDS Using Distributed-Memory Machines 
 
Figure 15 shows the parallel performance of Mach 3 flow past a square block using different number 
of cells. Results show that for the large problem (1,064,700 cells) parallel efficiency can still reach 
92% using 128 processors of IBM-1350 (dual processors, dual cores) at National Center for High-
Performance Computing, Taiwan. For the small problem (10,647 cells), the parallel efficiency 
decreases rapidly with increasing number of processors, e.g., 50% using only 36 processors. With this 
implementation, very large problems can be readily simulated using the 2nd order QDS scheme, which 
is otherwise very time-consuming.

In this paper, an overview of the current status and future direction of the QDS method is presented. 
The recent progress of QDS as a Eulerian flow solver is presented, which includes: (1) a novel second 
order extension to the QDS scheme, 2) the QDS extension to axisymmetric flow - the world’s first 
true-direction, two-dimensional axisymmetric solver, 3) extension to multi-species, 4) a parallel QDS 
scheme using the distributed-memory MPI library, and 5) the large reduction of computational time 
possible using graphic processor units (GPUs) which enable speedup approaching ~100-300 times. 
Several flows, which include 1D shock tube simulations, 2D explosion and implosion simulations, 2D 
supersonic flow problems, 2D-axisymmetric pulsed pressure chemical vapor deposition (PP-CVD) 
simulations, and 2D/3D blast wave propagation in an urban environment, are presented to demonstrate 
the capability of the QDS method for inviscid fluid simulation.  
 
Several ideas for future extension of the QDS method are briefly outlined as follows, which include: 1) 
extension to arbitrary Nth order spatial reconstructions to further reduce the numerical diffusion, 2) 
extension to viscous flow simulation using Chapman-Enskog distribution, 3) use of cut cells for 
simulation of complex geometry whilst maintaining a Cartesian grid, and 4) hybridization with the 
DSMC method for rarefied-continuum flow simulation.
