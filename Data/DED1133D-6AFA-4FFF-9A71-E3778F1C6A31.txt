slider for use in designing next generation disk. The 
purpose of the study is to achieve robust 
tribological properties between the HDI optimized by 
using the Taguchi experimental design method and Grey 
relational analysis. This study will investigate the 
microstructure, hardness and lubricant bonded 
properties of the DLC film which will be correlated 
to the wear resistance of the disk and slider of the 
HDI. Based on the analysis, the deposition process 
parameters of the source gas type and substrate bias 
voltage are the most significant factors on SNR 
related to Id/Ig, hardness and lube bonded ratio of 
DLC films, disk wear density and head slider delta 
touch-down power, respectively. DLC film with a 
higher hardness and lube bonded ratio can enhance the 
disk wear resistance. The higher lube bonded ratio 
and the lower hardness of DLC films result in lower 
slider delta touch-down power (or a better slider 
wear resistance). There is a good correlation among 
Id/Ig, lube bonded ratio, disk wear density and 
slider delta touch-down power. Simultaneously, to 
optimize the disk wear density and the slider delta 
touch-down power for head disk design interface with 
a thermal protrusion slider, the optimum wear 
resistance of disk and slider were obtained using a 
C2H2 source gas, 25 sccm flow rate, -60 V substrate 
bias voltage and 0.5 A emission current, 
respectively.

Abstract 
This paper will study the effects of 
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(PECVD) parameters (source gas type, gas 
flow rate, substrate bias voltage and emission 
current) of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films 
on tribological properties with a thermal 
protrusion slider for use in designing next 
generation disk. The purpose of the study is to 
achieve robust tribological properties between 
the HDI optimized by using the Taguchi 
experimental design method and Grey 
relational analysis. This study will investigate 
the microstructure, hardness and lubricant 
bonded properties of the DLC film which will 
be correlated to the wear resistance of the disk 
and slider of the HDI. Based on the analysis, 
the deposition process parameters of the 
source gas type and substrate bias voltage are 
the most significant factors on SNR related to 
Id/Ig, hardness and lube bonded ratio of DLC 
films, disk wear density and head slider delta 
touch-down power, respectively. DLC film 
with a higher hardness and lube bonded ratio 
can enhance the disk wear resistance. The 
higher lube bonded ratio and the lower 
hardness of DLC films result in lower slider 
delta touch-down power (or a better slider 
 4
between the head/disk interface [7]. Hence, 
regarding the development of disk DLC 
overcoats, how can we meet the disk 
reliability requirements in tribology and 
read/write performance? How can we avoid 
the wear between a head thermal protrusion 
slider and disk? These are the core and 
important topics addressed in this paper. 
Compared with sputtering and ion beam 
deposition techniques, plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [8-10] is 
a good candidate to further improve the 
durability performance of the media by using 
thinner overcoats because it has the inherent 
advantage of offering better control of the 
chemical composition and bonding structure 
in the deposited thin films. Regarding the 
structure [11], physical [12], chemical [13,14] 
and mechanical properties [15] of PECVD 
DLC films, as studied by many researchers, 
the source gas with a different C/H ratio will 
result in different sp2/sp3 ratio of the DLC 
films, which correlated to their hardness, 
chemical inertness, thermal conductivity and 
electrical conductivity [16,17]. Ito [18] 
illustrated that a lower hydrogen content in 
DLC films will enhance its thermal stability 
and tribological properties. Park [19] 
illustrated that increasing the deposition bias 
voltage from 0 to 300 V resulted in a higher 
density and hardness of DLC films. Rubio [20] 
illustrated that decreasing the hydrogen 
content within the films gave higher thermal 
stability and wear resistance of DLC films. 
However, it has not yet been investigated 
whether or not improving the disk and thermal 
protrusion slider wearing resistance can be 
achieved by manipulation of the deposition 
conditions, i.e. optimization of source gas type, 
gas flow rate, substrate bias voltage and 
emission current. Therefore, developing a thin 
DLC, and providing better disk and thermal 
protrusion slider wear resistance is a necessity 
to meet the challenges of future HDD 
technology. This project will study the effects 
of PECVD DLC deposition parameters 
(source type gas, gas flow rate, substrate bias 
voltage and emission current) on disk wearing 
density and slider delta touch-town power 
with a thermal protrusion slider, in next 
generation hard disks. The microstructure, 
hardness, lubricant bonded ratio of DLC film, 
which is directly correlated to their disk 
wearing density and slider delta touch-town 
power of head/disk interfaces, shall be 
investigated. 
The need for improved product 
manufacturing has driven engineers to search 
and find an optimal recipe for processing. 
Therefore, the Taguchi method [21] was 
introduced as a useful engineering 
methodology to optimize the process 
conditions. This results in less experiments 
being required in order to study all levels of 
input parameters and also filters out some 
effects due to statistical variation [22]. The 
Grey system theory [23] was used to analyze 
the experimental results in order to obtain the 
optimal DLC overcoat deposition parameters 
for maximizing simultaneously the disk and 
thermal protrusion slider wear resistance 
between head disk design interface. Finally, 
this optimization of deposition parameters of 
DLC films will be confirmed, and the disk and 
slider surface characteristics of optimized 
DLC film deposition will be analyzed. 
三、實驗步驟與方法 
Glass substrates with a diameter of 65 mm 
and a thickness of 10 mm were utilized in this 
study. All substrates were sequentially 
deposited with under layers, inter layers of Cr, 
 6
nm ultra thin DLC films, the hardness of 
overcoats is defined as a “composite” value of 
an ultra thin films/magnetic layer system. The 
1.2 nm lubricant layer thickness was measured 
by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) 
spectrometer. The amount of the lubricant 
bonded to the overcoat surface was measured 
by FTIR on the disk surface before and after 
solvent washing. The lubricant bonded ratio 
was defined as the ratio of bonded lubricant 
thickness to the 1.2 nm total lubricant 
thickness. 
The wear resistance test of disk DLC films 
was conducted using a thermal protrusion 
slider in a tribological tester. (Testing 
procedure step 1: start disk at rotating speed of 
7200 rpm with 50% relative humidity and 23 
°C temperature. Step 2: load head slider on 22 
mm of disk radius position. Step 3: adjust 
tribological tester chamber pressure to 30 KPa. 
Step 4: perform on track tribological test of 
slider/disk interface for 10 minutes.) After test, 
each disk was scanned with an optical surface 
analyzer to examine the worn surface quality 
and measure the disk wear density. The disk 
wear density shall be obtained from the 
integrated density of worn surface reflective 
image by optical surface analyzer. The lower 
disk wear density correlates to a better wear 
resistance of the disk DLC film. Meanwhile, 
each slider after test was examined with 
optical microscopy and SEM/EDS to examine 
the slider surface cleanness, respectively. The 
wear resistance test of the thermal protrusion 
slider was performed using a head burnish 
sweep testing procedure (Step 1: slider 
loading site is 22.30 mm of disk radius 
position, then move to 17.30 mm and check 
the stability of head touch-down system. Step 
2: test touch-down power and apply extra 40 
mW for overstress. Step 3: slider sweeps from 
17.30 to 27.18 mm, and back to 17.30 mm. 
Step 4: after a repeat of step 3 for 10 cycles, 
measure the delta touch-down power. Step 5: 
repeat 10 cycles of steps 3 to 4.). Totally 10 
data points of delta touch-down power were 
obtained after 100 cycles of head sweep 
iterations for each of the Taguchi experiments. 
The lower delta touch-down power correlates 
to a better wear resistance of the thermal 
protrusion slider. 
After using Taguchi experimental design, 
the experimental results, i.e. Id/Ig, hardness 
and lube bonded ratio of DLC films, disk 
wearing density and slider delta touch-down 
power, were first transformed into 
signal-noise ratio (SNR) form and then 
investigated by using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). The optimal parameters of DLC 
overcoat deposition for maximizing the 
hardness and lube bonded ratio, and 
minimizing the Id/Ig, disk wear density and 
slider delta touch-down power of DLC films 
can be finally obtained. The Taguchi method 
was then used to analyze the significant 
factors and contribution values. The SNR of 
the disk wear density and slider delta 
touch-down power can be further normalized 
and then investigated by using Grey relational 
analysis. Optimized disk and slider wear 
resistance parameters simultaneously which 
were obtained from the Grey relational 
analysis were then verified using the DLC 
deposition parameters optimization for head 
disk design interface with a thermal protrusion 
slider from a tribological point of view. 
四、結果與討論 
4.1. Microstructural characterisation of DLC 
films 
The Raman spectra of 2 nm DLC CH films 
with conditions 1, 5 and 7 are shown in Fig. 2.

voltage is the second most significant factor 
with its percentage contribution being 24.7% 
on the SNR of Id/Ig. The increases of emission 
current, from 0.5 to 1.5 V, results in a SNR of 
Id/Ig change from 1.38 to -0.18. A higher Id/Ig 
of the overcoat film was found using higher 
emission current. But, the emission current is 
not significant factor because its percentage 
contribution is only 13.9% on the SNR of Id/Ig. 
The increase of gas flow rate, from 25 to 45 
sccm, results in only a slight increase in SNR 
of Id/Ig as it increases from 0.37 to 0.60. A 
lower Id/Ig of the overcoat film was found 
using higher gas flow. Thus the Id/Ig ratio 
decreases with increasing source gas flow rate, 
indicating a compositional change from a less 
dominant sp3 structure towards a highly 
dominant sp3 structure (i.e. increasing sp3 
fraction) [26]. Consequently, the DLC films 
with higher source gas flow rate are seen to 
have a higher number of sp3 bonds than those 
of DLC films with lower gas flow. But, the 
gas flow rate is not a significant factor 
because its percentage contribution is only 
1.3% on the SNR of Id/Ig. However, there is 
no significant change on the main parameters 
over these emission current and gas flow rate 
ranges. Therefore, the deposition process 
parameters of the source gas type and 
substrate bias voltage are the most significant 
factors for the SNR of Id/Ig ratio when the 
DLC films are deposited on the top magnetic 
layer. 
Table 4 elucidates the main effects and 
their percentage contribution of each factor on 
the SNR relative to hardness. The influence of 
source gas type, C2H2, C2H6 and CH4, which 
results in a change in the SNR related to 
hardness as it decreases from 22.97 to 21.76. 
The decrease in the SNR related hardness 
value is explained by a higher hydrogen 
incorporation using CH4 source gas. 
Obviously, lower hardness is illustrated to be 
found in CH4 source gas film compared with 
the film with the C2H2 source gas. The higher 
sp3 structure of CH4 source gas DLC film 
results in a lower hardness than that of C2H2 
gas. A study by Zhao et al. [27] demonstrated 
that the sp3 components include the stronger 
C–C and weaker C–H groups. Thus, the 
sp3/sp2 fractions can be evaluated by the 
integrated area of these bands over the C=C 
band. This lower Id/Ig ratio (or higher sp3/sp2 
ratio) in CH4 source gas films occurred 
because CH4 provided more hydrogen content, 
which induced more and weaker C–H bonds, 
resulting in the lower hardness. Compared 
with C2H2 source gas films, the D and G peak 
positions of CH4 source gas film have been 
shifted to lower wavenumbers. The shift of the 
G band can be partially related to the 
detraining action of higher hydrogen, which 
can also be responsible for the decrease in the 
Id/Ig ratio. The presence of C–H bonds can 
also weaken the adjacent C–C bonds. Finally, 
Liu et al. [28] showed that as disorder 
structure sp3 increased, the averaged bond 
length increases, resulting in a low frequency 
shift of the D band. One notes that the 
mechanical properties are degraded as the 
sp3/sp2 ratio increases and the Raman intensity 
ratio Id/Ig decreases. This indicates that the 
stabilisation of tetrahedral coordination sp3 
bonding occurs alongside the development of 
a C–H bonded structure, with a corresponding 
decrease in hardness. Based on the analysis, it 
can be concluded that the source gas type is 
the most significant factor with its percentage 
contribution being 68.3% on the SNR of 
hardness. 
On the other hand, the increase of bias 
voltage, from -60 to -180V, results in an 
 10
results in a change in the SNR related to the 
lube bonded ratio shows a decrease from 
34.35 to 33.02. The decrease in the SNR 
related to lube bonded ratio is explained by a 
higher hydrogen incorporation using CH4 
source gas. Obviously, the lower lube bonded 
ratio is shown to be found using CH4 source 
gas film compared with the film using C2H2 
source gas. The lower Id/Ig and the higher sp3 
structure of CH4 source gas DLC films results 
in a lower surface energy than that of C2H2 
gas. A previous study demonstrated that the 
stabilisation of tetrahedral coordination sp3 
bonded structure results in a corresponding 
decrease in lube bonded ratio [30]. Based on 
the analysis, it can be concluded that the 
source gas type is the most significant factor 
with its percentage contribution being 52.1% 
on SNR related to lube bonded ratio. Other 
parameters such as, the increase of bias 
voltage, from -60 to -180V, results in a 
decrease in SNR related to lube bonded ratio 
as it decreases from 34.47 to 33.17. A higher 
substrate bias leads to a higher deposition 
impact energy, this causes more sp3 bonded 
structure and less surface energy, with a 
corresponding decrease in lube bonded ratio. 
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that 
the substrate bias voltage is the second most 
significant factor with its percentage 
contribution being 41.9% on SNR related to 
lube bonded ratio. The increase of gas flow 
rate and emission current resulted in a SNR 
related to lube bonded ratio of a slight 
decrease from 34.10 to 33.67 and increase 
from 33.78 to 33.97, respectively. Overall, the 
gas flow rate and emission current are not 
significant factors because their percentage 
contributions are only 5.0% and 1.0% on SNR 
related to lube bonded ratio. However, the 
deposition process parameters of the source 
gas type and substrate bias voltage still are the 
most significant factors for the SNR related to 
lube bonded ratio. 
As shown in Fig. 5, there is no obvious 
correlation between Id/Ig and hardness. But 
with an increase in the Id/Ig from 0.67 to 1.17, 
the lube bonded ratio increases from 42.5 to 
57.3%. There is a good correlation between 
Id/Ig and lube bonded ratio. A higher Id/Ig of 
the DLC film results during overcoat 
deposition condition variations resulting in a 
higher sp2 bonded structure, which then 
corresponds to the higher lube bonded ratio. 
 
4.2. Wearing resistance of disk and slider 
Table 6 shows the main effects and their 
percentage contribution of each factor on SNR 
related to disk wear density. The influence of 
source gas type, C2H2, C2H6 and CH4, results 
in a change in the SNR related to disk wear 
density as it decreases from 8.10 to -1.14. The 
decrease in the SNR of disk wear density is 
explained by a higher hydrogen incorporation 
using CH4 source gas. Obviously, the lower 
hardness and lube bonded ratio are also shown 
to be found in CH4 source gas film compared 
to the film with the C2H2 source gas. Based on 
the analysis, it can be concluded that the 
source gas type is the most significant factor 
with its percentage contribution being 60.4% 
on SNR related to disk wear density. 
For the other parameters, an increase of 
bias voltage, from -60 to -180V, results in a 
decrease in SNR related to disk wear density 
from 6.94 to 0.69. This decrease is due to 
DLC film structure changes which result in 
the lube bonded ratio decreasing along with 
hardness increasing with an increasing bias 
voltage. However, compared with hardness of 
the DLC film, the lube bonded ratio is a more 
dominant factor to affect the disk wear density. 
 12
rate and emission current are not significant 
factors because their percentage contributions 
are small, only 18.3% and 1.8% on the SNR 
related to delta touch-down power. 
 
4.3. Optimization of DLC deposition 
parameters simultaneously for disk and slider 
wear resistance 
In general, a higher lube bonded ratio in 
DLC overcoat films can improve the disk 
wear resistance (or disk wear density 
decreases) and slider wear resistance (or slider 
delta touch-down power decreases). A higher 
DLC overcoat films hardness can improve 
disk wear resistance and also result in worse 
slider wear resistance. Therefore, based on the 
Taguchi ANOVA analysis of the experimental 
results illustrates the best disk wear resistance 
can be obtained from an optimized source gas 
C2H2, gas flow rate 25 sccm, bias voltage -60 
V and emission current 1.5 A, respectively. 
On the other hand, the best slider wear 
resistance can be obtained from the optimized 
source gas C2H2, gas flow rate 25 sccm, bias 
voltage -60 V and emission current 0.5 A, 
respectively. 
The objective of this study was to explore 
and determine how to optimize the DLC 
deposition parameters in order to achieve an 
optimized disk and slider wear resistance 
performance for future HDD product 
requirements. Consequently, the Grey 
relational analysis was used to obtain the 
optimum design for disk and slider wear 
resistance, simultaneously. In order to obtain 
the optimal DLC deposition parameters 
simultaneously for disk and slider wear 
resistance of DLC films, the SNR of disk wear 
density and slider delta touch-down power, 
which are shown in Table 2, were used for the 
Grey relational analysis. 
Table 8 illustrates the signal-noise ratio 
(SNR, Si), normalization (Ni), difference (Di), 
Grey relational coefficient (Gi) and Grey 
relational grade value (Vi) of disk wear 
density and slider delta touch-down power for 
each of the Taguchi experiments. Each 
normalization (Ni), difference (Di), Grey 
relational coefficient (Gi) and Grey relational 
grade value (Vi) were obtained from the 
different calculation formulas, as defined in 
Table 8. 
The result of Grey relational grade values 
of disk wear density and slider delta 
touch-down power for each of the Taguchi 
experiments is shown in Table 9. Based on the 
analysis, it can be concluded that the source 
gas type is the most significant factor with 
36.9% contribution. The substrate bias voltage 
and gas flow rate are the second and third 
significant factors with 29.1% and 27.9% 
contributions. The emission current is not a 
significant factor with only 6.0% contribution. 
Overall, after Grey relational analysis, to 
optimize the disk wear density and the slider 
delta touch-down power for head disk design 
interface with a thermal protrusion slider from 
tribological point of view, it can be seen from 
Table 9 that the optimal DLC deposition 
parameters simultaneously evaluated for disk 
wear density and slider delta touch-down 
power of DLC films are A1(source gas type: 
C2H2), B1(gas flow rate: 25 sccm), C1(bias 
voltage: -60 V) and D1(emission current: 0.5 
A), respectively. Condition 1 of the 
experiment matrix meets these optimal 
deposition parameters. Compared with current 
design of condition 5 DLC film, as shown in 
Table 2, the disk wear density is improved 
from 0.90 down to 0.20% and the slider delta 
touch-down power is improved from 20.67 
down to 10.24 mW, by using Condition 1. 
 14
the most significant factor with a 36.9% 
contribution. The substrate bias voltage and 
gas flow rate are the second and third most 
significant factors with 29.1 and 27.9% 
contribution. The emission current is not a 
significant factor with only 6.0% contribution.

四、建議 
z 增加補助：本次會議雖收穫很多，然而往返法國卻是可謂長途跋涉，交通費用
固然較為昂貴，除了自行負擔食宿外，在交通補助上建議能有所提高。 
z 多元化：一般國內學術研討會都較為保守，多數以演講討論為主，若能廣泛邀
請國外學者及產業專家，並開發其他的聚會形式，也許更能刺激產業與研究學
者間的交流。 
 
五、攜回資料名稱及內容 
z 相關論文集及光碟片 
z 參展廠商相關技術資料 
z 面對面討論之廠商研發者、研究機構學者之相關名片 
 
六、其他 
研討會結束後，特別抽空去參觀斯德哥爾摩市政廳(如下列相片所示)，此為諾貝
爾獎之頒獎地點。參觀後，讓人有感於諾貝爾之偉大及獲得此獎之殊榮。有為者 亦若
是。

本研究將探討電漿輔助化學氣相沉積(PECVD)技術對硬碟片之類鑽碳膜沉積參數(氣體種
類、氣體流速、基板偏壓功率及發射電流)對下世代熱突出磁頭/硬碟片界面之磨潤、潤滑
劑鍵結特性的影響。本研究利用田口實驗設計法及灰階系統理論，以獲得最佳化的磁頭/
硬碟片界面之磨潤特性。開發新的磁頭/碟片飛行讀寫界面，即當磁頭在讀寫時，利用熱
突出磁頭滑行塊技術來降低磁頭/碟片的讀寫間距，但此熱突出磁頭滑行塊雖可用來降低
磁頭/碟片的讀寫間距，但其讀寫頭本身容易被碟片表面類鑽碳膜刮傷而造成讀寫可靠度
的問題；另外，此熱突出磁頭亦容易刮傷碟片表面類鑽碳膜，而造成下世代硬碟片磨潤及
磁性讀寫等耐久性問題。 
在下世代碟片磁性層表面保護層的類鑽碳膜研究上，如何開發適當的類鑽碳膜來改善硬碟
片本身的磨潤性；且硬碟片類鑽碳膜不刮傷熱突出磁頭滑行塊，以增進磁頭/碟片讀寫特
性及可靠度，乃為下世代碟片的核心研究重點。因為藉由 PECVD 之不同沉積氣體及各製程
參數的最佳化設計，對熱突出磁頭動態飛行情況下之耐久性及可靠度提出探討，來獲得最
佳化的類鑚碳膜與熱突出磁頭動態飛行。 
研究分析發現，類鑚碳膜沉積氣體種類與基板偏壓對拉曼 Id/Ig 比值、硬度、潤滑劑鍵結
比例、碟片耐磨與磁頭耐磨性之影響最大。高硬度及高潤滑劑鍵結比例之類鑚碳膜可增進
碟片耐磨性；但低硬度及高潤滑劑鍵結比例之類鑚碳膜才可改善磁頭耐磨性。Id/Ig 比值、
