An integrated circuit approach- Lowest Voltage Switching (LVS), for boundary mode 
buck converters is proposed. This technique automatically locates the optimum timing of 
turning on the power MOS at lowest drain-source voltage by compensating the circuit 
delay. Switching loss can be reduced and efficiency improved. No additional external 
components or timing calculation circuits are needed. It can also be applied to boost, 
buck-boost converters and so on. Circuit implementation, simulation, experimental results, 
and layout are shown for an example with VIN of 5V and VOUT of 0.938V. At 3MHz 
operation, the measured conversion efficiency of the tested circuit with LVS, is 11% higher 
than that without LVS.

1.2 Power System Solutions 
1.2.1 General Concepts 
There are mainly three types of voltage conversion and regulation stages: 
switch-mode power supplies, charge pumps, and linear regulators. A switch-mode 
power supply typically contains at least a magnetic component such as an inductor or a 
transformer to facilitate the energy conversion [1]. The output voltage of a switch-mode 
power supply can be either higher or lower than the input voltage by using different 
circuit topologies. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of a switch-mode 
power supply is normally the highest compared with the other two types of voltage 
conversion stages. However, it is more complex, more expensive and needs more 
off-chip components. Also, the bulky energy-storing magnetic component limits the 
board size reduction and is not feasible for on-chip integration. 
On the other hand, a charge pump, which switches connections of capacitors to 
transfer electrical charges and thereby shift the voltage level, is usually designed for 
low-power low-voltage-accuracy applications [2]. Similar to a switch-mode power 
supply, the output voltage of a charge pump can be either higher or lower than the input 
voltage by selecting different topologies. Moreover, a charge pump can achieve over 
90% power conversion efficiency under optimal operation [3]. Its relatively simpler 
structure and fewer off-chip components make it popular for the light-emitting diode

2 Research purpose 
2.1 Backlight Inverter 
A fluorescent lamp is lighting by emitting ultraviolet light to fluoresce the phosphor 
coating on the surface of lamp, and the ultraviolet light is generated by gas discharge in 
the lamp tube. CCFL induces the gas discharge without heating the cathode. As a result, 
the operating voltage is usually high and increases with the length of lamp. 
Conventionally, a backlight inverter with magnetic transformer is designed to provide 
the high sustaining voltage of CCFL. However, the turn ratio of magnetic transformer is 
determined by the striking voltage of CCFL. CCFL has a striking voltage 1.5~2 times 
higher than sustaining voltage. Since magnetic transformer has a flat gain through the 
operating frequency, the turn ratio should be designed for the maximum output voltage, 
and the extra voltage drop to the sustaining is absorbed by a ballast capacitor in series 
with CCFL. 
2.2 LDO 
In a generic LDO system, there is a long-lasting stability issue, which limits the stable 
range of the load capacitor with its parasitic equivalent series resistance (ESR). Because 
an LDO utilizes a negative feedback to regulate its output voltage, the phase margin and 
the gain margin of the LDO system must be sufficient to maintain the stability of the 
LDO and to prevent the output voltage from oscillation. However, for a stable LDO 
using the conventional compensation scheme, both the off-chip load capacitor and its 
ESR value are required to fall into a specific tunnel-like region, that is, for a known load 
capacitor value, its ESR must lie in between a lower limit and an upper limit [5,6].  
Moreover, as far as the SoC integration is concerned, the load capacitor of an LDO is 
likely to be fully integrated into the chip to save the board size and the pin counts. 
However, the load capacitor of a typical LDO usually ranges between 1μF and tens of 
micron farads, so the load capacitor would be off-chip if a conventional LDO is used. 
Even if an LDO is specifically designed and fully integrated into a SoC system without 
an off-chip load capacitor, the exact value of the effective on-chip load capacitor and its 
ESR are difficult to be predicted accurately because of the process variation. 
Furthermore, all the subsequent circuits supplied by the LDO would affect the total 
effective capacitance at the output. As a result, the compensation for the LDO without 
an off-chip load capacitor is extremely troublesome due to the loosely-controlled load 
capacitance, so the stability of the fully-integrated LDO is difficult to be guaranteed.  
Also, as the post-regulation stage of a switch-mode power supply, an LDO should 
isolate its output from the fluctuations at the main supply voltage. However, at the

3.1 Backlight Inverter 
3.1.1 Introduction 
This chapter will give an overview on some prior techniques for driving piezoelectric 
transformer inverter. The introduction is given in two directions. The first one is the 
feedback control for piezoelectric transformer. Since piezoelectric transformer has 
narrow bandwidth and the resonant frequency drifting with load resistance, it is 
dangerous to drive piezoelectric transformer open loop at constant frequency [10-[12]. 
The second one is the driving topologies of the inverter. Since piezoelectric transformer 
has a large equivalent input capacitor, ZVS design is necessary for the efficiency of 
switching power stage. Advantages and drawbacks of these techniques will be discussed 
to give a summary. 
3.1.2 Control Strategies for Piezoelectric Transformer 
The first traditional control scheme is current control which is designed to provide 
constant lamp voltage by adjusting the operating frequency of piezoelectric transformer. 
錯誤! 找不到參照來源。 show block diagram of a control IC from Texas Instrument 
Inc. Current control has the advantage that it is suitable for most of the driving 
topologies. It can also provide the equal current function in a multi lamp system 
[13],[14].  
Since current control design fixes the lamp current, designer should design the 
controlled lamp current to match the operating points of piezoelectric transformer. And 
if the driving condition changes, the constant output current may force piezoelectric 
transformer to be driven at a worse efficiency. 
The other popular control scheme is phase control. Phase delay between input and 
output of piezoelectric transformer is usually the controlled parameter of phase control. 
Since piezoelectric transformer is modeled as a RLC resonant circuit, phase delay 
changes sharply at the resonant frequency. By forcing the phase delay as a proper 
constant, the operating point can track the change of resonant frequency. As a result, 
phase control is suitable to maintain the piezoelectric transformer operated near the 
resonant frequency [15]-[21]. 
However, phase control is only suitable for half-bridge or Full-Bridge driver. 
Furthermore, when determining the control phase, the other phase delay in the control 
loop, for example the filter, should be considered.

phase with different ZVS inductance, so phase control strategy can not be utilized with 
push-pull topology. The two magnetic devices in the power stage is also one another 
disadvantage. 
3.1.4 Half-Bridge Backlight Inverter with Series Inductor 
Fig. 0-3 shows a typical half-bridge driving piezoelectric transformer inverter. To be 
the power stage driving piezoelectric transformer, half-bridge topology has the 
advantages that it is suitable to utilize phase control as the control strategy for 
piezoelectric transformer [15]-[20],[24].  
For half-bridge driving piezoelectric transformer, there is usually a series inductor in 
front of piezoelectric transformer. This inductor forms a band pass filter with input 
capacitor of piezoelectric transformer to reject the input harmonics. It also provides 
half-bridge circuit an inductance load to create lagging current for ZVS. Since the

design is realized with a radial vibration mode piezoelectric transformer and fluorescent 
lamp, and a Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer driven CCFL may not have enough 
current for ZVS [27], [28]. Furthermore, the operating point is far away from resonant 
frequency. It may cause a lower efficiency. 
3.1.6 Summary 
Feedback control and ZVS are two important issues to the efficiency of inverter 
based on piezoelectric transformer. In order to operate the piezoelectric transformer at a 
better operating point, phase control strategy is a better choice. As a result, the 
half-bridge topology should be the driving circuit and the ZVS should be achieved with 
the series inductor. In next chapter, the control phase will be analyzed based on the 
equivalent circuit of piezoelectric transformer. And in chapter 4, a high order harmonic 
ZVS technique is presented to solve the delay problem the series inductor.

 are at relatively 
higher frequencies and they are normally much higher than the unity-gain frequency 
(UGF) of the loop gain. So, they are neglected in the following stability analysis. 
Therefore, the following analysis considers two low-frequency poles, one zero, and one 
high-frequency pole. They are ωPL ,ωPI, ωZESR, and ωPBUF, respectively. The Bode 
plot of the loop gain for a stable LDO using the conventional compensation scheme is 
shown in Fig. 3-7.

3.2.2 Tunnel of Death Problem 
In Fig. 3-8, the first non-dominant pole, ωPAR, usually equals to ωPBUF because of 
the large parasitic capacitance at the gate of the pass device. The zero ωZESR, if well 
located, raises the phase shift and helps maintain a sufficient phase margin. As long as 
the UGF is located between ωPAR and ωZESR, the stability of the LDO, which is a

As a result, the loop gain ADC and the load pole ωPL in equation (3.5) are functions of IL 
such that the stable range of RESR would vary with IL. 
A 150mA/2.5V LDO with a load capacitor of 10µF and a supply voltage of 3V is 
designed and simulated using SPICE model to verify the analysis above. The minimum 
phase margin is set to be 45 degrees and the stable region of RESR at different load 
currents is depicted as Fig. 3-9.

As Fig. 3-9 shows, the analysis is quite consistent with the simulation results. 
Moreover, to ensure the LDO being stable for all loading conditions, the RESR should be 
limited between 0.45Ω and 0.65Ω in this example. The resultant stable range of RESR, 
which can be precisely predicted by equation (2.13) under different loading conditions, 
is quite small. The narrow stable range makes the major design effort for LDO usage is 
to select a load capacitor with proper ESR [29]. However, ESR, which varies with 
temperature and bias voltage, is not well controlled [30]. Moreover, the nonzero ESR 
would limit the optimization of the transient load step response performance [6, 31]. 
Since the shape of the strict stable region of the ESR is like a tunnel, it is known as the 
“tunnel of death.＂

Fig. 0-7 The typical LDO system for PSR analysis. 
 
From equation (3.8), both PSRA and PSRB can influence the PSR because of the effect 
of the numerator. However, the effect is significant only if the sum of PSRA and PSRB is 
close to (1+1/GMPRDS) so that the numerator can be affected significantly. Furthermore, 
there are one zero at ωPI, two poles at moderate frequencies, and another zero at ωZESR 
from equation (3.8). The exact position of the two poles depends on the value of K and 
the relative position of ωPI, ωPL and ωZESR. It should be noted that the two poles 
would become complex if the discriminant of the denominator is negative.  
Assuming that the effect of PSRA and PSRB is minor as frequency changes, the 
simplified PSR over frequency can be plotted as Fig. 3-11. The internal pole ωPI at low 
frequency will inevitably cause the PSR degradation at the frequency higher than ωPI 
due to the zero at ωPI in equation (3.8). Moreover, the possible complex poles in 
equation (3.8) might cause a peaking, which would further deteriorate the PSR as the 
dashed line shown in Fig. 3-11. To avoid the PSR peaking, the following equation

4  Circuit Design 
4.1 Backlight Inverter 
4.1.1 Introduction 
For piezoelectric transformer driven with half-bridge topology, a large inductor is 
usually series in front of piezoelectric transformer. This inductor has two functions. The 
first one is to form a band pass filter with input capacitor of piezoelectric transformer. The 
second one is compensating the capacitance of the piezoelectric transformer input to create 
the lag current for ZVS [16]-[19]. Both of the two designs cause the nature frequency of 
LC tank close to the operating frequency of piezoelectric transformer. As a result, the LC 
tank introduces voltage gain and phase delay to the control loop. It complicates the phase 
control design for piezoelectric transformer [24].  
Since quasi-modal piezoelectric transformer can take over the filter function, a high order 
harmonic ZVS design is presented to reduce the phase delay and voltage gain. 
Quasi-modal piezoelectric transformer can filter out high order harmonics by its input 
electrode. As a result, the harmonics of input square voltage can be utilized to generate 
ZVS current. A smaller inductor can be applied to resonant with input capacitor of 
piezoelectric transformer at a high order harmonic. At fundamental frequency, the smaller 
inductance introduces few phase delay and nearly unity voltage gain to the feedback 
control loop. In this chapter, the ZVS condition is analyzed to determine the small series 
inductance. 
4.1.2Analysis of High Order Harmonic ZVS 
ZVS is achieved if input current can completely charge or discharge the MOS 
parasitic drain-to-source capacitance, Cds. However, the input LC tank does not filter out all 
harmonics, so the total input current has harmonic components. According to superposition, 
the PT backlight inverter could be decomposed into several equivalent circuits 
corresponding to different harmonic frequencies. Integrate the input charge during 
deadtime by applying phasor analysis separately, and the total input charge during 
deadtime could be added up. 
4.1.3Single Frequency Phasor Analysis  
To apply phasor analysis, the input square voltage should be decomposed into 
separate sinusoid voltage sources. Fig. 4-1 shows a half-bridge driving voltage with  ZVS 
waveform and small deadtime. It is approximately a 50% duty cycle periodic square-wave 
and can be decomposed into Foueier series, which is shown in (4.1). The K-th cosine 
function can be applied to phasor analysis as input voltage phasor at K-order harmonic.

Input charge of separate harmonic current can be derived by substituting corresponding 
input impedance into (4.4). 
4.1.4 Input Impedance of Piezoelectric Transformer 
In order to apply (4.4), load of half bridge circuit at different harmonics should be 
derived. According to Fig. 4-2, ZPT,1 has the equivalent RLC resonant circuit at fundamental 
frequency. Thus ZIN,1 has a complex equivalent circuit. At high order harmonics, however, 
the quasi-modal piezoelectric transformer decompresses the resonance, so there is no 
resonant circuit. The piezoelectric transformer can be equivalent into the input capacitor 
Cin,K, then ZIN,K is a simple LC circuit.

Suppose the harmonic current is designed for ZVS, two conditions should be fulfilled. 
The first one is K2ωn2LrCin,K>1 to make QK positive. It means that the current flows out of 
the half bridge circuit to discharge Cds while input voltage is switching down. The second 
one is that the resonant frequency of Lr and Cin,K should be close to harmonic frequency K
ωn. As a result, the small K2ωn2LrCin,K-1 can enlarge QK to completely discharge Cds. The 
parasitic DC resistance Rr is usually small, however it may have to be considered at the 
harmonic near the resonant frequency. 
To other harmonics, Rr could be neglected and (4.6) can be simplified into

The RLC equivalent circuit of piezoelectric transformer should be considered when 
calculating the input charge at fundamental frequency. The equivalent circuit is shown in 
Fig. 4-5. The CCFL equivalent resistance and output capacitance are reflected to primary 
side, and the parasitic DC resistance of Lr is neglected.

Equation (4.13) shows the estimated ZVS condition for resonant inductor design. The 
Cin,K can be measured with impedance analyzer; the ωn can be calculated by the equivalent 
circuit of piezoelectric transformer; the Cds can be get from datasheet of the power MOS, 
and the td can be set as 500ns which is a normal spec. of half bridge driver IC. Finally, the 
resonant inductor Lr is the only parameter left for design.  
If a small Lr is designed to resonant at a higher order harmonic, it may induce some 
lower order harmonics to have negative QK. Then the selected harmonic needs to generate 
larger resonant current to make up for the additional negative charge. However, the 
maximum positive QK may be limited by an unknown Rr according to (4.6). As a result, it 
is safer to confirm that all lower order harmonics have positive QK. 
Designing Lr with the smallest K2ωn2Cin,K can guarantee the positive QK of all harmonics. 
Since K2ωn2Cin,K increases with square of harmonic order, calculating the value of 3rd, 5th 
and 7th is usually enough for comparison.

The charge at N-order harmonic is designed to fulfill the negative input charge of 
fundamental frequency and the charge for Cds. And the positive input charge of other 
harmonics is considered as over design. Equation (4.14) is simple enough to give a solution 
of Lr. Finally, after the resonant inductor is made, the parasitic DC resistance Rr can be 
measured. Substitute Lr and Rr to (4.6), (4.7), and (4.12) for check. If Rr is too large to 
fulfill inequality (4.12), slightly reduce Lr can increase positive input charge. On the 
contrary, over design current may introduce more conduction loss. If the positive input 
charge is large enough, it is good for efficiency to increase the Lr a little. 
4.1.8 ZVS Design and Phase Control 
The resonant inductor Lr is in series with piezoelectric transformer and forms an LC 
circuit with the input capacitance. It will introduce additional phase delay to the phase 
control loop. In order to determine the control phase, the effects of Lr at fundamental 
frequency should be estimated. 
The VIN, Lr and Cin in Fig. 4-5 are transferred into a Thevenin equivalent circuit, and the 
new equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 4-6.

4.1.9 Summary 
This chapter presents a ZVS method for PT backlight inverter utilizing high-order 
input current harmonics. By applying smaller resonant inductor, high order current 
harmonic is enhanced to charge and discharge the power MOS parasitic capacitance. ZVS 
condition is analyzed to design the inductor, and the phase delay is also estimated to adjust 
the phase control loop. Since the phase delay is small, the ZVS design can be independent 
from the design of phase control loop. 
4.2 LDO with Extended Stable Region for the ESR of the Load Capacitor 
 From the aforementioned stability analysis in Chapter 2, an LDO using the 
conventional compensation scheme relies on the zero generated from the ESR of the load 
capacitor to maintain the stability. Moreover, the stable range for the ESR of the load 
capacitor is relatively narrow. As a result, one of the major concerns for the LDO usage is 
to select the load capacitor with appropriate ESR. However, the ESR of a capacitor, which 
is a parasitic value, highly depends on types of capacitors, temperature, operating 
frequencies and biasing voltages so that it is difficult to be precisely controlled [15].

Fig. 4-9 Frequency response of single pole-zero pair. 
However, for three pole-zero pairs as shown in Fig. 4-3, the most negative phase shift 
PhaseMIN might occur at 1 1P Z , 2 2P Z  or 3 3P Z  and it depends on the zero-to-pole 
ratio of each pole-zero pair and the relative position between all the pole-zero pairs. In the 
example of Fig. 4-3, assuming the zero-to-pole ratio are the same for all the three pairs, 
PhaseMIN would occur at 2 2P Z  because both pole-zero pairs P1-Z1 and P3-Z3 would 
contribute negative phase shift from P2 to Z2 and makes the phase shift at 2 2P Z  the

To sum up, equation (4.3) and (4.4) are the stability criterions of the LDO using the 
proposed compensation scheme. From equation (4.3), it is clear that there is no lower 
bound for RESR. In other words, RESR can be as low as possible to optimize the transient 
response performance. However, a minimum load capacitor is required to stabilize the 
LDO using the proposed scheme according to equation (4.4).  
4.2.2 Circuit Implementation 
 To realize the LDO using the proposed compensation scheme, both the pass device 
and the internal error amplifier are specially designed to provide the required pole-zero 
pairs in Fig. 4-8. The pass device with split structure is proposed to produce multiple 
pole-zero pairs. Moreover, an error amplifier with the R-C path is used to generate another 
pole-zero pair [6]. A source follower using PMOS is also utilized to push the parasitic pole 
at the gate of the pass device to a high frequency.  
4.2.3 Pass Device Structure 
The proposed pass device structure is depicted in Fig. 4-11. The split structure is used 
to generate multiple pole-zero pairs required for the proposed compensation scheme. In our 
design, the aspect ratio of Mi is larger than M(i+1) and Ri is much larger than R(i+1). Intuitively, 
the structure mainly utilizes the parasitic gate-to-source capacitance and the additional 
resistive elements to produce multiple poles. Furthermore, zeros are obtained by the effect 
of current summation at the drain terminals of the split transistors M1~M4.

In equation (4.23), the right-half-plane (RHP) zero CGD1/gm1 and the non-dominant pole 
which is approximately CGS1/gm1 would be nearly at the transition frequency of the 
MOSFET and are much higher than the UGF of the loop gain [13]. Therefore, they can be 
neglected in our analysis. By comparing equation (4.24) with equation (4.23), it can be 
observed that a pole and a zero are generated through the structure by adding M2, CGS2, CGD2 
and R2. Moreover, the RHP zero becomes approximately CGD2/gm2 which is the same as 
CGD1/gm1 in equation (4.23) and can also be neglected.  
Considering the effect of adding another split transistor, the frequency of interest would be 
at higher frequencies since R3 and the aspect ratio of M3 are much smaller than R2, M2 and 
R1, M1, respectively, in our design. Therefore, the transfer function is dominated by M2 
because the gate signal of M1 is effectively attenuated by R1 and CGS1. As a result, the 
transconductance of M1 can be ignored and another additional pole-zero pair is generated 
by M3, C3 and R3 which can be estimated as

4.3.1 Compensation Scheme 
A pole-zero pairs compensation scheme, which is an extension of the compensation 
scheme introduced in Chapter 4, is proposed to remove the strict constraints on the load 
capacitor and the ESR for stability. Depicted in Fig. 4-17 is the conceptual Bode plot of the 
LDO loop gain using the pole-zero pairs compensation scheme, where the load pole PL is 
excluded. Similar to Fig. 4-15, several pole-zero pairs are placed to produce a roughly flat 
phase response. However, in this compensation scheme, the load pole PL is not required for 
stabilizing the LDO. As long as the relative frequencies of the pole-zero pairs are designed 
properly, the phase margin can be guaranteed and the LDO is stable with any load 
capacitance.

Fig. 4-17 Conceptual Bode plot of loop gain using the pole-zero pairs compensation 
scheme. 
 
Both gain and phase response of multiple pole-zero pairs are required to be 
investigated in order to verify the stability of the proposed scheme. Similar to the analysis 
in Chapter 4, the average gain slope MA of the multiple pole-zero pairs in Fig. 4-17 can be 
estimated from equation (4.5). Moreover, although the exact phase response of the 
pole-zero pairs, which depends on the relative position of poles and zeros, is quite 
complicated, an intuitive insight can be acquired if the spaces between different pairs are 
assumed to be far enough such that the mutual interaction can be neglected. Under the 
assumption, the phase response of the multiple pole-zero pairs would behave like Fig. 4-10 
and the most negative phase shift PhaseMIN would occur within one of the pole-zero pairs. 
PhaseMIN can thereby be estimated from equation (4.1). In the real design, the phase 
response of multiple pole-zero pairs is wavy as shown in Fig. 4-10 and it is shaped as flat 
40 
 
To sum up, as long as RESR is smaller than RL, the phase margin of the LDO with the 
proposed pole-zero pairs compensation scheme is at least (90-PhaseMIN) degrees, which is a 
design choice and can be adjusted by the relative positions of poles and zeros. Nevertheless, 
RESR is rarely larger than RL in generic applications, so the LDO using the proposed 
compensation scheme is almost stable with any load capacitor. Moreover, in the 
capacitor-free case, the LDO would achieve the highest bandwidth which is limited by PPAR 
as shown by case 1 in Fig. 4-18. The pole PPAR can be pushed to a high frequency by the 
buffer stage for improving the loop bandwidth of the LDO.  
It should be noted that although the settling time for high accuracy such as 0.01% will be 
degraded due to the internal multiple pole-zero pairs, the settling time for moderate 
accuracy such as 1%, which is sufficient for our LDO, will not be largely affected [64]. 
4.3.2 Circuit Implementation 
The required pole-zero pairs in Fig. 4-17 can be produced through an amplifier with an 
R-C path and the pass device with split structure introduced in Chapter 4. However, the 
amplifier with an R-C path can generate only one pole-zero pair and the DC loop gain is 
therefore limited due to the lack of pole-zero pairs at lower frequencies. Consequently, the 
regulation performance might not be satisfactory. To achieve a higher loop gain, the 
proposed error amplifier is made of three parallel-connected signal paths with different 
gain and bandwidth to produce more pole-zero pairs at lower frequencies.  
 The multi-path error amplifier has been used to achieve higher gain and/or higher 
bandwidth in the low-voltage processes [65, 66]. Also, the error amplifier with parallel 
structure is used within LDOs to improve the transient response speed and regulation 
performance in [67] and [68], respectively. Nevertheless, in the proposed LDO, the 
purpose of the multi-path amplifier is to produce low-frequency pole-zero pairs required 
for the proposed compensation scheme to achieve a higher DC loop gain while maintaining 
the stability. Fig. 4-19 shows the overall block diagram of the proposed error amplifier 
with the split-structured pass device. The VREF is generated by a VBE-referenced self-biased 
bandgap reference circuit, which is not shown for simplicity [13].  
In Fig. 4-19, path1 is formed by GM1 and GM2a. On the other hand, path 2 consists of GM1 
and GM2b, and GM3 forms path3. These three signal paths, path1, path2, and path3, have 
different gain and bandwidth as shown in Fig. 4-20 , so multiple pole-zero pairs can be 
generated through the summer stage SUM. Assuming the gain of the summer stage is unity 
for each path, the total gain from the input through all transconductance stages to the 
output of the summer stage would be simply the summation of the gain of the three signal 
paths. 
 
42 
 
where A1, A2, P1, P2 are the DC gain of path1, path2 and the dominant pole of path1, path2, 
respectively. Similarly, as the second zero Z2 is considered, the frequency of Z2 can be 
estimated by neglecting path1 as the following equation: 
 ( )2 3 1 2 22 2
2 2 3 3 3
1
A A PP AZ P
A P A P A
+ ⎛ ⎞= ≈ + ×⎜ ⎟+ ⎝ ⎠
,             (4.32) 
where A3 and P3 are the DC gain and the dominant pole of path3. Beside the zeros 
generated from equation (4.31) and (4.32), poles are generated directly from the three 
signals paths as P1, P2 and P3. Therefore, the frequency of each pole and zero can be 
adjusted by appropriately modifying the gain and bandwidth of each signal path. 
Fully-differential operational transconductances (OTAs) are used to construct the 
error amplifier with three signal paths, and GM1 provides the two sets of outputs for GM2a 
and GM2b, as shown in Fig. 4-19. The buffer stage utilizes a high-bandwidth large-swing 
OTA connected as the unity gain configuration [69]. It can reduce the effect of the 
parasitic pole and to provide large output swing to drive the pass device such that the 
dropout voltage can be reduced. Fig. 4-21, 4.22 and 4.23 show the detailed circuit 
schematics with the bias currents of GM1, the buffer stage, and the summer stage, 
respectively. The corresponding aspect ratios of transistors and component values are listed 
in Table 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. The common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuits for GM1, which are 
not shown for simplicity, sense the output common-mode voltage and adjusting the tail 
currents, such as M9~M12 in Fig. 4-21 [13]. I2 and I3 in Fig. 4-21 are used to reduce the 
output impedance of GM1.

4.4 LDO with High PSR Bandwidth 
LDO has been used to provide a clean supply voltage for sensitive circuit blocks such 
as RF circuits and analog circuits. One of the major purposes of this kind of LDO is to 
isolate its output from the fluctuations at the main supply voltage. Sufficient power supply 
rejection (PSR) is thereby required. Moreover, if the main supply voltage is provided by a 
switch-mode power supply, there are inevitable voltage ripples at the switching frequency.

where K is the DC loop gain which is the same as in equation (3.9) and other terms can be 
referred to equation (3.8). In equation (4.33), because the pole and the zero at ωPI will 
roughly cancel with each other, the PSR transfer function contains only one pole at K×ωPL 
equivalently, as depicted in Fig. 4-27. Comparing Fig. 4-27 with Fig. 2.11, there is no PSR 
degradation at high frequencies in Fig. 4-27 such that the PSR at high frequencies can be 
effectively improved. In fact, the PSR at frequencies higher than K×ωPL is even better 
than the PSR at DC if the proposed strategy is used.

4.4.2 PSR Enhancement of the Proposed Strategy 
To validate the proposed compensation strategy, two 3.3V/50mA LDOs with 1µF load 
capacitor are designed and simulated for comparison. The schematics with the bias  
50 
 
conditions of the two LDOs are shown in Fig. 4-28. The LDO in Fig. 4-28(a) uses the 
conventional compensation scheme, and the LDO in Fig. 4-28(b) uses the proposed 
compensation strategy illustrated in Fig. 4-26. For comparison, except the compensation 
scheme, the topology and the bias conditions are exactly the same for these two LDOs. The 
aspect ratio of each corresponding transistor is also identical. The aspect ratios and 
component values are listed in Table 4.5. 
 As shown in Fig. 4-28(a), the LDO uses the conventional scheme consists of a 
buffer stage, a pass device, and an error amplifier with two gain stages. RESR is used to 
create ωZESR for the conventional compensation scheme. CC and RZ comprise the internal 
compensation network and generate an internal low-frequency pole ωPI1. It is worth to 
mention that although the internal low-frequency pole is produced using an additional 
on-chip capacitor CC in this design sample, a low-frequency pole could be generated 
without additional capacitors if other operational amplifier topologies with high output 
impedance are used, such as folded-cascode or telescopic operational amplifiers [13].  
The LDO using the proposed compensation strategy shown in Fig. 4-28(b) also has two 
gain stages as the LDO in Fig. 4-28(a), but the internal compensation network consisting of 
RZ and CC is excluded. Because the output impedance of each gain stage is less than 
500KΩ, the parasitic poles at these nodes are placed beyond the UGF of the loop gain. The 
buffer stage separates the gate of the pass device from the output of the second gain stage 
to avoid the generation of low-frequency parasitic poles. In this way, all poles of the 
internal circuits are higher than UGF and no on-chip capacitor is required. Two gain stages 
are used to attain 60dB loop gain at DC in this design sample. Larger gain and higher 
bandwidth are possible if more gain stages are used.  
The two LDOs are simulated using SPICE models of a 0.5-µm CMOS technology. 
Fig. 4-29 shows the Bode plot of the loop gain of the two LDOs at full load. Both the 
LDOs have the load pole fPL at 2.4KHz. The internal pole fPI1 in the conventional scheme is 
at low frequency as in Fig. 2.7. However, for the LDO using the proposed scheme, the 
internal pole fPI2 is placed beyond the UGF. Therefore, there is only one low-frequency 
pole fPL in the proposed compensation strategy.

Table 4.5 lists the key parameters used in the analysis of PSR. The frequency 
response of PSR at full load is depicted in Fig. 4-31. The curves of analysis are drawn 
according to equation (3.7), (4.34) and Table 4.5. As shown in Fig. 4-31, the analysis 
results correspond with the simulation results. The PSR of the conventional LDO starts to 
degrade around fPI1 as predicted. Moreover, since PSRB increases to nearly unity at high 
frequency, the overall PSR using the conventional compensation scheme starts to improve 
around 4MHz. On the other hand, in the proposed LDO, there is no PSR degradation at 
high frequencies. The small peaking around 5MHz of the PSR is caused by the multiple 
parasitic poles near UGF, which are not included in the analysis for simplicity. Compared 
with the conventional LDO, the PSR of the proposed LDO improves by 26dB at 1MHz. 
Furthermore, the PSR of the proposed LDO is better than -40dB from DC to 100MHz from 
the simulation result.

Fig. 4-33 Schematic of the current-efficient LDO with high PSR bandwidth 
 
Applying the proposed compensation strategy, a current-efficient 3.3V/50mA LDO 
with high PSR bandwidth is designed and the schematic with the bias currents at no load is 
depicted in Fig. 4-33. The aspect ratios and the component values are listed in Table 4.6. 
Similar to Fig. 4-28(b), it has two gain stages to generate sufficient DC loop gain. 
However, a buffer with the diode-connected PMOS MPS is used instead of the simple 
PMOS source follower used in Fig. 4-28(b) [35].  
 
Table 4.6 Aspect ratios and component values of the LDO in Fig. 4-33 
 
The 
advantages of the 
buffer with the 
diode-connected 
PMOS are twofold: 
First, it can further 
improve the overall 
PSR. Second, the 
buffer is dynamically biased such that the ground current of the LDO at no load is largely 
reduced. The bias current of the buffer stage is proportional to the load current flowing 
through the pass device MP because of the current mirror formed by MP and MPS. At no

This buck converter is designed to be operated in voltage mode control. “Peak 
Detector＂ and “LVS＂ determines the best timing to turn on S1. 
In transient state, “Peak Detector＂ is activated while “LVS＂ is not. As resonance 
occurs (in stroke Ⅲ), “Peak Detector＂ stores the peak value of VLX. Then it compares 
this stored value with resonating VLX through a comparator and then sends a “0＂ to 
“R-S Latch＂. S1 is thus switched on and the stored value in “Peak Detector＂ is reset 
to GND level.  
In steady state, “Peak Detector＂ and “LVS＂ are both activated. VLX is sampled in 
“LVS＂. When VLX swings to its peak value VLXL, “Peak Detector＂ stores this value 
and “S/H＂ of “LVS＂ keeps sampling VLX. Just as in transient state, VLXL is 
compared to VLX and “0＂ is sent to turn on S1. As S1 is on, VLX swings down to VLXLD 
and this value is held in “LVS＂ as VLXLA. The time from VLXL stored to S1 actually 
switched on is denoted by ᇞtD in the form of a differential voltage VLXL - VLXLD = VLXL - 
VLXLA. That is, the time VLX swings from VLXL to VLXLD is equal to that from VLXLA to VLXL. If 
“LVS＂ compares VLXLA with resonating VLX and sends “0＂ to turn on S1 in 
resonance stroke in the coming cycles, S1 will be exactly switched on as VLX swings to its 
peak value, VLXL. LVS is thus achieved and switching loss can be minimized.

5.1.1 High Order Harmonic ZVS 
The resonant inductor is designed according to (4.14). Fig. 5-2 shows some 
parameters of the piezoelectric transformer measured by the impedance analyzer Angilent 
4294A (Agilent Technologies Japan, 2003). Suppose the equivalent resistance of CCFL is 
150KΩ, the piezoelectric transformer has resonant frequency at 59.5 kHz. The 3rd 
harmonic current is designed for ZVS according to the analysis in section 0. Applying the 
parameters in (6.1), Cin,3 and CIN in Fig. 5-2, a 820mH resonant inductance is derived from 
(4.14). Finally, a 791.5uH inductor with 0.14Ω parasitic dc resistance is made.

5.1.2 Waveforms of Harmonic Current 
Fig. 5-3shows the experimental results of the harmonic input. It is obvious that the 3rd 
order harmonic current is enhanced at input stage and then filtered out by the quasi-modal 
piezoelectric transformer itself. The CCFL still have a sinusoid lamp voltage at 
fundamental frequency. The amplitude of harmonic current at input stage is about 150mA 
to 200mA. 
5.1.3 ZVS Waveforms 
Fig. 5-4 shows the ZVS waveforms of the half-bridge circuit. Comparing the VIN and 
the gate-to-source voltages (VGS) of two power MOS, the Cds of power MOSs are 
completely charged or discharged during deadtime. ZVS waveforms are shown in Fig. 5-5 
with a smaller time scale. The deadtime is 800ns and it takes about 500ns to charge or 
discharge the Cds.

5.1.4 Phase Delay of ZVS Design 
Since there are 3rd order harmonics in the input voltage of piezoelectric transformer, it 
is hard to tell the phase angle of the fundamental frequency. In order to estimate the phase 
delay of the ZVS design, a sinusoid voltage driven piezoelectric transformer is measured to 
find the phase delay of piezoelectric transformer only and compare with the half-bridge 
driven one.  
Fig. 5-6 shows the circuit for estimation. The sinusoid voltage source VIN,SIN is a 
function generator sinusoid signal enhanced by power amplifier HSA4052 (NF 
Corporation Japan, Ltd, 2000), and the VIN,SQR is the square voltage of half-bridge output. 
The experiments are measured with open loop circuit since the sinusoid voltage driven 
circuit can not apply feedback control. For comparison, the two voltage sources apply the 
same operating frequency and the amplitude of VIN,SIN is adjusted to have the same lamp 
current as the 150V VIN,SQR. 
By measuring the voltage gain and phase delay of VOUT over VIN, the differences 
between the two circuits are the estimating voltage gain and phase delay of the LC tank.  
 
Fig. 4-6 Experimental circuit for estimating delay and voltage gain of ZVS design. 
 
Fig. 5-7 shows the experimental waveforms. In Fig. 5-7 (a), the phase difference of 
piezoelectric transformer is 81.1° and the step up ratio is 7.39. Comparing with the 
experimental result in Fig. 5-7 (b), the control phase is 87.0° and the the step up ratio is 
7.72. Comparing the two experimental results, the LC tank introduces 6.1° phase delay and 
0.96 voltage gain.

5.2 LDO with Extended Stable Region for the ESR of the Load Capacitor 
The proposed LDO with a bandgap reference has been implemented using a 0.5-μm 
1P2M CMOS technology. The micrograph of the die is shown in Fig. 5-9. The chip area of 
the LDO without bandgap reference is 520μm×450μm and the chip area of the bandgap 
reference is 485μm×170μm. The LDO is designed to deliver a maximum load current of 
150mA and the preset output voltage is 2.5V. The load regulation is 0.53mV/mA and the 
line regulation at full load is 7.3mV/V. The power supply rejection (PSR) s 41dB at 10Hz 
and decreased to 28dB at 100KHz.  
Fig. 5-10 shows the experiment setup for the load step response. A load resistor of 16.7
Ω is connected to an N-type power MOSFET MSW in series which is driven by a square 
wave from a function generator. MSW is switched on and off such that the load current of 
the LDO changes periodically between 0 and 150mA. The rise and fall time of the load 
step are smaller than 100ns.

The 80mV voltage drop in Fig. 5-11 as the load changes is mostly produced by the bond 
wire resistance and on-chip routing resistance because the sampled output voltage VFB in 
Fig. 4-14 changes by only 12mV as the load current changes from 0 to 150mA. Therefore, 
the estimated actual output voltage drop should be 25mV, which is consistent with the 
simulated step response in Fig. 4-16. The total resistance composed of the on-chip routing 
resistance and bond wire resistance can be estimated to be around 0.37Ω since the 
maximum load current is 150mA. The extra voltage drop due to the parasitic resistance can 
be improved by better layout and multiple bond wires for the output pin. 
Summarized in Table 5.1 are the comparisons of several key performance parameters 
among the LDOs in literature and the fabricated LDO. The figure of merit   (FOM) 
mentioned in Chapter 2 is used to evaluate the overall performance of the LDOs. A smaller 
FOM indicates that the LDO has better performance by considering both the current 
efficiency and the load step response. As listed in Table 5.1, [1] and [24] have smaller 
FOM than the LDO proposed in this work. The LDO proposed in [60] achieves very fast 
response with only 0.6nF on-chip load capacitor, but the quiescent is 6mA such that the 
current efficiency is relatively low. The LDO in [75] provides the smallest FOM without 
the requirement of ESR. It utilizes the buffer impedance attenuation technique to realize a 
single-pole response with only 20μA quiescent current and 1μF output capacitor.

The total measured current consumption of the LDO including the scaling network 
without the bandgap reference is 69.1μA and the current used by the bandgap reference is 
37.5μA. The dropout voltage is 40mV at the load current of 50mA. The load regulation is 
0.76mV/mA and the line regulation at full load is 2.3mV/V. The power supply rejection 
(PSR) of the LDO is -46dB at 1KHz and -30dB at 10KHz without an off-chip load 
capacitor.  
The load step transient response is used to verify the stability of the LDO. The load 
current is periodically switched from none to 50mA and back to none with rise and fall 
time less than 100ns. Fig. 5-14 shows the waveforms of the load step response with 
different combinations of load capacitor and ESR. The upper trace and lower trace in Fig. 
5-14 are the output voltage and the load current, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5-14(a), the 
LDO is stable without an off-chip load capacitor. From Fig. 5-14(a) to 5.14(d), it can be 
observed that the transient voltage variation is reduced as a larger load capacitor is used, 
but the settling time is increased because UGF is decreased as

depicted in Fig. 5-3. Moreover, the LDO is still stable with the combination of small 
load capacitor and high ESR, as shown in Fig. 5-14(e). The load step response validates 
that the output voltage of the proposed LDO remains stable with different combinations 
of CL and RESR. Thus, the LDO with the proposed pole-zero pairs compensation scheme 
can withstand large variation of the load capacitor and ESR while providing a stable 
output voltage.

is -42dB at DC and the PSR bandwidth is 1MHz. However, there is an unexpected peaking 
around 1MHz to 10MHz, which is different from the previous analysis. The possible cause 
of the peaking is discussed in the next section.

Fig. 4-18 PSR performance of the LDO. 
 
The peaking of the PSR in Fig. 5-18 may caused by the bond wire resistance of the 
output pin and the ESR of the load capacitor. Fig. 5-19 demonstrates the two parasitic 
resistances, RBOND and RESR. Both of the two resistances would introduce zero with the load 
capacitor in the loop gain and thus affect the PSR performance. The zero in the loop gain 
might be located around UGF and influences the system stability. Therefore, the simple 
single-pole assumption for the error amplifier is no longer valid and the high-frequency 
poles should be taken into consideration. In Fig. 5-19, the error amplifier is modeled as a 
two-pole system in order to include the effect of high-frequency parasitic poles. Following 
the similar procedure in section 2.3 and assuming RBOND and RESR are considerable, equation

Fig. 5-20 shows the simulated PSR performance under different RBOND and RESR. It can 
be seen that larger RBOND and RESR would cause larger peaking and the corresponding worse 
PSR performance.  
The measured RESR of the load capacitor is 28mΩ at 100KHz and the estimated RBOND 
is 0.2Ω. These two resistances could cause a PSR peaking around 3MHz in Fig. 5-18 and 
the resultant PSR bandwidth is limited to 1MHz. Nevertheless, using the proposed 
compensation strategy, the PSR bandwidth can still be largely extended compared with the 
conventional compensation scheme. 
5.5 Buck Converter 
An LVS control IC has been designed and fabricated in 0.5um process and the 
die-photo is shown in Fig. 5-21. Fig. 5-22 and Fig. 5-23 show the measured waveforms 
with external components L1=10uH, CL=47uF, RL=7.5, and fast-recovery diode FR107. 
Here, VDD=5V, and VOUT=0.938V. LVS is not enabled in Fig. 6(a) while in Fig. 5-22(b) it is 
activated. It can be figured out from Fig. 5-22(b) that in resonance stroke, S1 is switched 
on as VLX swings to its peak value VLXL – Lowest Voltage (VDS) Switching. Because of

the optimum timing for turning on the power MOSFET at the lowest drain-to-source 
voltage. No additional external components and timing calculation circuits are needed. The 
operation principle is analyzed and circuit implementation and layout are shown. 
Experimental results are also shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control 
concept. At 3MHz (9.38mA output current), the conversion efficiency with presented 
control technique, LVS, is 11% higher than that without LVS.
