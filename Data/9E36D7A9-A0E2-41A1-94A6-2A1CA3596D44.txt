致性線性陣列，能夠同時估測二維來臨方向 (2-D DOAs)和重疊複合正弦頻率。這
個提出的方法是建立於由電磁感測向量陣列所取得的數據而產生的一對鉛筆矩陣
(matrix pencil)，而即使感測元素間距超過半波長，也能夠利用特徵向量 (eigenvector)

3completely polarized transverse electromagnetic plane waves with different baseband modulated frequencies.
The signals travel through a homogeneous isotropic medium, incident on a linear array of equally spaced and
identical electromagnetic vector-sensors. The kth signal has the electric field vector ek and magnetic field vector
hk and can be expressed as [4], [5]
ek=sin γkejηkvθ (1)
hk=Zo
(
cos γkvφ + sin γkejηkvθ
)
, (2)
where 0 ≤ γk < π/2 is the auxiliary polarization angle and −π ≤ ηk < π is the polarization phase difference.
For linearly-polarized transverse electromagnetic waves ηk = 0; for circularly-polarized waves, γk = 45◦ and
ηk = ±90◦ (+ for left circularly polarized and − for right circularly polarized),Zo is the transmission medium’s
intrinsic impedance and is real-valued, v is a unit vector along the subscript’s coordinate. After normalization
and expressing (1) and (2) in Cartesian coordinates, we have
ek=
(
sinγk cos θk cosφkejηk − cos γk sinφk
)
vx +
(
sin γk cos θk sinφkejηk + cos γk cosφk

)
vx −
(
cos γk cos θk sinφk − sin γk cosφkejηk
)
vy
+cosγk sin θkvz , (4)
where 0 ≤ θk < π is the signal’s elevation angle measured from the vertical z-axis, and 0 ≤ φk < 2π is the
azimuth angle. The kth signal is characterized by its six component electromagnetic field vector

5and similarly, the signal subspace of Y is spanned by the columns of AΦ. Define E1 and E2 as the signal
subspace matrix for X and Y, respectively. Assuming K < M < N , where N is the number of snapshots
taken, E1 and E2 can be obtained by performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) on X and Y such
that
E1 = first K columns of UX, (8)
E2 = first K columns of UY, (9)
where X = UXΣXVHX and Y = UYΣYV

Y . Since the columns of E1 and A span the same K-dimensional
subspace, and the columns of E2 and AΦ span the same K-dimensional subspace, they are related by an
arbitrary nonsingular K ×K matrix, T, such that⎡

To obtain the frequency estimates f1, f2, . . . , fK , we need to solve for Φ. From (10), we have
E2=E1T−1ΦT
⇒Φ = TE−11 E2T−1 = TΨT−1. (11)
Thus, Φ is the eigenvalue matrix of Ψ with T as its eigenvector matrix. Using Φ and T, the estimates of θk
and φk can be obtained by computing A. This can be done by noting from (10) that

does not have to be included in the above equation because when γk = 0, ezk will be equal
to 0. nf can be estimated by noting that since Δx ≤ λmin/2, then −π ≤ Arg (q̂ (θk, φk)) < π, so that
n̂f = argmin

As a result, the disambiguated frequency estimates can be obtained as
f̂k = f̂k0 +
n̂f
ΔT
.
It can be seen from (17) that the estimation accuracy of n̂f depends on the estimation accuracy of f̂k0 and
ûk. and q̂ (θk, φk). According to [8], the accuracy of Â in (12) is adversely affected when the SNR is low.
Since estimates ûk and q̂ (θk, φk) are deduced from Â, thus, in low SNR condition, the estimate for fk can
be adversely affected. The same situation applies to n̂f as well so that the disambiguation algorithm for the
frequency estimate is influenced by the SNR and under low SNR, it can fail if the number of snapshots N is
not sufficient.
III. RESULTS
The performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by the following three simulations which show the
standard deviation and bias of the 2-D DOA and frequency estimates. The K signal sources are monochromatic
uncorrelated sources with energy Pk normalized to 1, for k = 1, 2, . . . ,K . The integer NT is set to 1. The
total least-squares ESPRIT algorithm [8] is used in all the simulations. A total of 400 snapshots were utilized.
In the first simulation, we show the case for unambiguous frequency estimates by setting the temporal
sampling frequency to half the Nyquist rate. K and M are set to 3 and 4, respectively. The parameters for the
three signals are:
{θ1, θ2, θ3}={100◦, 30◦, 76.7◦},
{φ1, φ2, φ3}={60◦, 335◦, 69.1◦},
{γ1, γ2, γ3}={0◦, 45◦, 45◦},
{η1, η2, η3}={0◦, 0◦, 90◦},
{f1, f2, f3}={6.9, 7.1, 7.3}.
Figure 1 shows the results for standard deviation of the the direction cosine estimates, frequency estimates and
the root mean square bias for the direction cosine estimate and frequency estimates for the 3 sources. The
temporal sampling frequency is set to Fs = FNyp/2 = fmax = 7.3. The sensor spacing Δx = 7.3c2fmax . As the
figures show, the accuracy of the estimates improves as the SNR increases. In addition, all the estimates are
unbiased.
9Figure 2 shows the results for standard deviation of the direction cosine estimates, frequency estimates and the
root mean square bias for the direction cosine estimate and frequency estimates for the 8 sources. Once again,
the accuracy of the estimates improves as the SNR increases. However, the bias of the estimates does not seem
to be affected by the SNR, as in the case for the first simulation. This might be due to the increased number
of parameters which needs to be estimated.

Emerging Topics in DSP, FIR Digital Filters, Convolutive Blind Signal Processing for Speech 
Signals, OFDM/CDMA Systems, and Blind Signal Processing & Applications.  I have found 
many papers to be of great interest and importance to my research, including papers on 
using instrumental variables as an efficient identification algorithm for FIR filtering with noisy 
data, design of cosine-modulated pseudo-QMF banks using semidefinite programming 
relaxation,the equalization of channels with ZP precoders, training-based estimation of 
correlated MIMO fading channels in the presence of colored interference, the persistentcy of 
excitation for blind channel estimation in cyclic prefix systems, a sequential constrained 
least-square method for minimax design of linear-phase FIR filters with Time-Domain 
constraints, and fractionally spaced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems.  All 
these papers have proven useful in my own research topics related to robust 
precoder/equalizer design, insufficient guard interval equalizer design and blind channel 
estimation and equalization.  I have also spoken to the authors of several of these papers 
and the discussions have been fairly fruitful. 
3、 Recommendations 
I strongly recommend my own students to attend this conference as it contains many papers 
relevant to their research.  Since this is the flagship conference of the Circuits & Systems 
Society at the IEEE, not only will the students benefit from the technical content, but they will 
also be able to meet many people who are working in similar research areas.  I have found 
enhancements in my own research through active discussions with many of these experts 
during and after the conference.  This conference also serves to give students more of a 
global view of what is going around besides the research topics they are working on.  This 
will be extremely useful to Ph.D. students, who will possibly be faculty themselves upon 
graduation, in order to assist them in selecting which research topics others are working on 
and problems that remain to be solved. 
4、 Title and content of conference data 
The 2007 ISCAS was focused on ubiquitous computing, sensing and perception.  18 tracks 
were organized, including analog signal processing, biomedical circuits & systems, blind 
signal processing, cellular neural networks & array computing, circuits & systems for 
communications, computer-aided network design, digital signal processing, graph theory & 
computing, life-science systems & applications, multimedia systems & applications, 
nanaelectronics & gigascale systems, neural systems & applications, nonlinear circuits & 
systems, power systems & power electronics circuits, sensory systems, visual signal 
processing & communications, VLSI systems & applications, and ubiquitous computing.  
There were also 21 special sessions.  Three keynote speeches were held including Dr.
