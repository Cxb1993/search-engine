ABSTRACT
This article proposes a use of the dual-tree discrete wavelet
transform (DT DWT) to the problem of signal detection in
underwater sound. This approximately shift invariant DT DWT
can generate multi-resolution subspaces that keep more of their
coefficient energy in each of these subspaces than discrete
wavelet transform’s (DWT). The detection performance com-
parison, under the same value of the false alarm probability PF,
of this proposed DT DWT-based empirical model and DWT-
based method is presented. A performance comparison has
shown that this proposed DT DWT-based empirical model of
noise is better than the DWT-based detector.
I. INTRODUCTION
For signal detection underwater, several approaches have
been used and each involves some transformation of the raw
data. Various time-frequency approaches have been developed
to address this problem. Some of the methods make use of
wavelets to solve it [1], [2], [3], [4]. When the wavelet analysis
is viewed as a filter bank, the filter bank is composed of band-
pass filters with constant relative bandwidths [5]. The time
resolution of wavelet increases with the central frequency of
the analysis filters. This kind of analysis is suited for signals
composed of low frequency components of long duration
and high frequency components of short duration. This paper
attempts to use a dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DT
DWT) to detect transient signals underwater.
A period of noise-only data is used to build an adaptive
noise model of the background continuum utilizing the approx-
imately shift invariant DT DWT. The density estimation of the
joint distribution of the multivariate vectors of the following
observations, considered outliers from this noise model at any
time, are flagged as potential signals. Because the DT DWT
can generate multi-resolution subspaces that keep more of their
coefficient energy than that of discrete wavelet transform’s
(DWT), those retaining energy at different scales can improve
the performance of this proposed DT DWT-based detector.
II. APPROXIMATELY SHIFT-INVARANCE
WAVELET TRANSFORM
An efficient algorithm to implement this scheme using filters
is obtained by Mallat [6]. The DWT is an excellent way to
process a transient signal, as wavelets are compactly supported
in a time domain. The DWT uses scales and positions based
on powers of two, so its calculations are much more efficient.
One commonly used series of mother wavelets is constructed
by Daubechies [7]. In the DWT, the lowpass filter h0(n) fully
determines the orthogonal wavelet base. The analysis filters
of DWT are regularly spread in a logarithmic scale over the
frequency axis. Several researchers have proposed the use of
two wavelet transforms for signal analysis, where one wavelet
is the Hilbert transforms of the other [1]. Kingsbury found that
the dual-tree DWT is nearly an approximately shift invariant
when the lowpass filters of one DWT should be offset from
the lowpass filters of the second DWT by a half sample [8].
Selesnick gave an alternative derivation for the result from
Kingsbury [9]. He considered the design of Hilbert transform
pairs of wavelet bases, based on the limit function defined
by the infinite product formula, and arrived at the same result.
Let h0(n) and h1(n) be a class of exactly reconstructing filters
called “conjugate quadrature filters” or CQF’s [10]. That is
∑
n
h0(n)h0(n + 2k) = δ(k) =
{
1, k = 0
0, k = 0
and h1(n) = (−1)(n)h0(M − n). The scaling and wavelet
functions are given by the dilation and wavelet equations

in Fig.2 (a),(b). The plot of the function |Ψh(ω)+ jΨg(ω)| in
Fig.2 (c) shows that it approximates zero for ω < 0 as desired
if ψh and ψg form a Hilbert transform pair. Using these two
digital filters, the dual-tree discrete wavelet is made in Fig.3.

Based on this dual-tree structure, we form the approximately
shift invariant DT DWT in Fig.4. The degree of shift invariance
of this scheme is illustrated in Fig.5 (a). The input is a unit
step, shifted to 17 adjacent sampling instants in turn. Each
unit step is passed through the approximately shift invariant
DT DWT in Fig.4. The outputs D1,...,D4 of this structure are
reconstructed from the wavelet coefficients at each of levels 1
to 4 in turn and depicted in Fig.5 (a). Good approximately shift
invariant property is shown when all the 17 output components
from a given level have the same shape. It is clear that
the DT DWT in Fig.5 (a) is independent of shift while the
imperfections of the DWT with wavelet db8 are fairly obvious
in Fig.5 (b).
III. SIGNAL DETECTION AND COMPUTER
ANALYSIS
Summary characteristics of the wavelet analysis within
temporal windows can be relevant to signal detection [3], [4],
[13], [14]. According to [3], the dolphin sounds are divided
into appropriate time scales, or time ”windows,” that can
effect any summarization. Any given input data is subdivided
into periods of 0.743 second (with each period containing
215 = 32, 768 data points).
The wavelet reconstructing details of the dolphin sounds
S [15] (involving 215 = 32, 768 data points) based on the
DWT with db8 produce a summary in a way that lent itself
to use in detection. The input signal is sampled at 44.1
kHz; thus a window with a length of 128 samples of the
reconstructing detail (32, 768 data points) corresponds to a
time period of .0029 seconds. This window is sufficient to
capture significant changes in the dolphin sounds in this
application. The reconstructing details in level 2 to level 5,
covering the frequency ranges that are of interest in this case
(i.e. 1–10 kHz), are summarized in terms of four mean sums
of squares, (xt,2 , · · · , xt,5) for each time window t, so that
xt,j =
∑128
k=1 Dj
2
k
128
j = 2 , · · · , 5, j = 2 , · · · , 5,
where Dj2k are taken from time window t. We focused on three
mean sums of squares and forming a vector of multivariate
observation xt= (xt,2 , xt,3 , xt,4) in time window t. The be-
havior of these observations xt, t = 1, · · ·, 256 cover the range
2.5–10KHz. xt= (xt,2 , xt,3 , xt,4) represents the behavior of
the multivariate observation of typical dolphin signals. During
a period of noise when no ’signal’ is present, the behavior is
symbolized as xt= (xt,2 , xt,3 , xt,4) .
The joint behavior of these mean sums of squares of noise
is significantly different from that of signals. This result
suggests the usage of density estimates to establish the initial
density estimate of noise and then to detect the signal. Density
estimates can be obtained by using a multivariate kernel
density estimator with a multivariate normal kernel [16] such
that, given data xt, ...,xT , the estimator used is
gˆ(x) =
(detR)1/2
(2π)3/2Th3
T∑
t=1
exp(− (x− xt)
′R−1(x− xt)
2h2
),
(3)
where R is a robust estimate of the covariance matrix [17],
[18], [19] and h is a suitable global window width. The
optimal choice of h can be determined by cross-validation,
by maximizing the approximate log-likelihood for the data∑T
t=1 log(gˆt(xt)), where gˆt refers to the kernel density esti-
mate based on all given data x1, ...,xT , except xt itself. The
duration T of the initial sample size in Eq. (3) has to be large
enough to ensure stable kernel estimates [16].
In this particular case, the duration T = 256 is selected.
This kernel estimator gˆ(x) is first applied to an initial sample,
x1, ...,xT , taken from the sound recording, which consists of
pure background noise without signals of interest. Once this
