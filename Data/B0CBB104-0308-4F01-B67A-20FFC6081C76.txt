英文摘要
Ten-year of bio-hydrogen research projects funded by National Science Council would be
introduced in this study. The multidiscipline-integrated project which included the region of
engineering, life science, and biotechnology would be divided into four phases for introduction.
In the second part the results of the continuous processes fed with the dual substrates mixed with
carbohydrate and peptone will be listed. Higher dilution rate has the positive effect for hydrogen
fermentation could be summarized. According to the results of bio-molecular monitoring, the
dominant population of Clostridium sp. could found in hydrogen fermentation system. In the
starch-peptone fed system, the dominant population shifted to Lactobacillus sp. could also be
found. The introduction of kitchen waste fermentation would be introduced in the last part. A
completed database of kitchen waste characteristic has been developed. The kitchen waste
collected from several metropolises in Taiwan such as Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, and Tainan
City, have been studied. Some of the laboratory scale reactors fermenting kitchen waste would
also be introduced.
二、報告內容：
前言與研究目的
The majority of environmental issues in 21th century would be global warming and energy crisis.
To solve this problem, bio-hydrogen is a good alternative method to develop clean and renewable
energy for the global environment. Hydrogen is an ideal alternative fuel because of its clean,
sustainable and renewable characteristics. Hydrogen has the energy yield of 122 kJ/g that is 2.75
times higher then hydrocarbon fuels and could be directly used to produce electricity through fuel
cells [1, 2]. Some scientists predict that a new economy empowered by hydrogen will
fundamentally change the nature of our market, political and social infrastructures in the 21th
Century, just as coal and petroleum did in the 19th and 20th Centuries [4,5]. Among the hydrogen
production methods, the most promising and environmentally friendly one seems to be the dark
fermentation of organic wastes as it solves the problems of energy production and waste disposal
at the same time [6]. The possibly use of hydrogen as one of the major energy sources in the near
future has been studied in the US and Japan since the early 1990s. The President of US had
characteristics of kitchen waste are listed in Table 1. The total solid (TS) of raw kitchen waste
was 63.7 g/L and 80% of TS was volatile. The total COD was amounted as 102 g/L in raw
kitchen waste, but the carbohydrate was only occupied 17% of COD. The raw kitchen waste was
further shredded by the blender in the laboratory. The blended kitchen waste was stored at 4oC
refrigerate to prevent acidification happened in the storage tank. The seeding microorganisms
were obtained from 3-ton pilot scale acidogenesis tank in a kitchen waste composting plant in
Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.

Operation of Intermittent-Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor
An intermittent-continuous stirred tank reactor (I-CSTR) is shown in Figure 1. The total
volume of the CSTR is 3 L. The mechanic mixer was at an agitation speed of 160 rpm. The
screw-type of baffle was set to increase the turbulence during operation. The amount of gases
produced was measured with a wet-gas flow meter. The I-CSTR was kept in an air-bath
incubator and the temperature was maintained at 35±1oC. The agitation rate was 160 rpm. The
collected kitchen fed into the I-CSTR using a peristaltic pump with fill-and-draw operation. The
pH controller (Suntex pH/ORP controller PC-330) was set to maintain pH value between 5.3 and
5.6. Every runs has operated at least 20 days to get the sufficient samples for statistic evaluation.
Different hydraulic retention times (HRT) controlled are listed in Table 2.

Figure 1 gives the hierarchy of this integrated project from 1998 to 2001. The subprojects 1, 2,
and 5 investigate on the effect of different substrates to hydrogen production; subproject 3 studies
on the isolation and identification of hydrogen producing bacteria; subproject 4 works on the
photosynthetic hydrogen production; subproject 6 conducts the reactive system modeling; and
subproject 7 studies the microbial community and diversity of hydrogen producing bacteria. Each
subproject led by 1-3 professors in the area of their expertise investigates on some key elements
of the biohydrogen process.

Another integral project funded by National Science Council titled “A zero CO2 emission
bioenergy system –the solution to global warming and energy crisis in the 21th century”was
started since 2007. The objective of this study was to combine the region of life science,
engineering and environmental management for “Environmental-friendly Bio-fuel”production.
Mainly, two-stage of hydrogen production process (i.e. dark-fermentation and
photo-fermentation). The innovative carbon dioxide removal process by micro-algae absorption
was established in this project. The produced micro-algae-biomass is intended to be recovered for
the feedstock of first-stage of dark-fermentation. The enzyme-cellulolytic process will also be
developed prior to dark-fermentation process. The members of this project include seven
professors in National Cheng Kung University: Professor Sheng-Shung Cheng, Professor Hsin
Chu, Professor Jo-Shu Chang, Associated Professor I-Cheng Tseng, Associated Professor
Liang-Ming Whang, Assistant Professor Yasuhiro Fukushima, and Assistant Professor Jer-Horng
Wu. The research structure was presented in figure 2. In summary, the short-term goal of this
project is to develop an effectively cellulosic compound hydrolyzing system. The mid-term goal
is to integrate the system for a better performance. Finally the long-term goal is to demonstrate a
commercially viable bio-hydrogen system without CO2 emission.

under different dilution rates. (A) hydrogen producing rate, (B) biomass concentration in these
two fermentors
In the glucose-peptone fed reactor, the microbial sample was taken when the operation of
dilution rate as 0.083/hr. In starch-peptone fed system, the microbial sample was taken at the
operation of dilution rate as 0.33/hr. All the sequences, about 1,500 bps, were identified with the
reference sequences available on the GenBank database. The most abundant ones found in the
glucose-peptone fed system were closely related to Clostridiaceae family. Oppositely, in
starch-peptone fed system, the most abundant ones were closely related to Lactobacillus
plantarum. Lactobacillus plantarum is a kind of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria and has
advantages to ferment starchy substrates directly to lactate [16]. The results of phylogenic
analyses were illustrated in figure 4.
4. Process performance evaluation of hydrogen fermentor fed with kitchen
waste
In Taiwan, the kitchen waste has been collected and classified by the collecting systems of the
local environmental protection administrations since 2003, and the amount of it is increasing.
According to the statistic data, the amount of kitchen waste collected in 319 towns in Taiwan
amounted to 1,600 tons per day, and the recycling percentage was about 33.5%. The government

A 110-L fluidized bed was also established for treating vegetable kitchen waste. The progress of
this study is to modify the anaerobic fluidized bed and to make the functional improvement from
the traditional anaerobic hydrogen fermentor. The basic concept of the improvement of fluidized
bed design is to refine the fluid characterization of previous fermentor. To tell the difference from
traditional fermentor, the jet was set for completely mixing and replaced the function of stirred
propeller to make better turbulence for high-solid-contained substrates. Besides, the scum
collecting system was set at the top of the reactor. A typical continuous stirred tank reactor
(CSTR) model was clear according the results of this tracer study. Highly dispersion situation
was occurred with special down-flow jet-mixing with headspace air recirculation.
At start-up of anaerobic fluidized bed reactor about 25-day operating period, the hydrogen
production rate would be measured as 0.26 L-H2/L/day and yield was 0.8 mmol-H2/g-COD when
the volumetric loading rate was 14 g-COD/L/day. Because of scum blocking in the air pipe, the
hydrogen performance might be discount by uncompleted gas collection.

Summary
Based on our results, batch test, morphology observation, and molecular method detection,
abundant and potential hydrogen producing bacterium existed in the acidogenesis biological
system. To get sufficient degradable substrate, shorter hydraulic retention time and higher organic
loading rate are suggested to apply for the hydrogenation process performance. Previous attempts
showed the thermal treatment of the sludge and acid/base acclimation could be applied in
screening the hydrogen producing bacteria. However, in our experiences, it is believed that if the
environmental condition can be controlled well, the hydrogen producing system can be

一、參加會議經過
Anaerobic Digestion 11th World Congress in Brisbane, Australia
On Tuesday, Fatih Birol, the head of Economic Division of the International Energy Agency
(IEA) reviewed the evolution of world energy demand in the 21at century. First of all, he
asserted that the primary oil demand is increasing at an astonishing rate. With only few
major oil producers and high-risk countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq,
consumers are confronted with serious security supply issues. Iran, for example, is a very
important player with 4 bbl/day of oil production while Iraq struggles under a complicated
political situation, leaving its future unclear. Natural Gas (NG) importance is also increasing
rapidly and alone two countries, Russia and Iran, process 50% of the world’s reserves. 
Considering the disputes between Russia and Ukraine, NG supply security has become a
highly debated and sensitive theme worldwide. Secondly Briol addressed some of the
environmental issues that are plaguing the entire globe. He touched on few European
topical such as the effort to close 80% of all coal-fired power plants in Europe over the next
few decades. The third challenge he discussed was energy and the poor. Worldwide more
than 1.6 billion people ( one out of four ) live daily without access to electricity.
To summarize, humanity faces three major challenges: oil & NG supply security,
environmental issues and energy and the poor. IEA believes that World Alternative Policy
Scenarios (WAPS) must be set into action in order to improve the energy-environmental
situation worldwide. Better efficiency of energy utilization, less tension in and around the
countries at risk, and greater investments in the New Energy Policy must be the initial
steps towards change.
Hydrogen, environment and sustainable development
During Tuesday morning’s plenary session chaired by Olivier Appert, Chairman and CEO 
of the Institute Francais du Petrole (IEP ), the main issues ;inked with energy, climate
change and sustainable development brought several viewpoints to light. During a first
presentation, Jean Jouzel, CEO of Pierre Simon Laplace Institute and Research Director
of CEA, gave his conclusion on the climate change, based on the research and data
collected by the IPCC ( International Panel for Climate Change ). Extreme events such as
hurricanes, cyclones and droughts have become more prevalent, supporting the
conclusion of human activities’ undeniable influence on global climate. 
Amory Lovins, CEO of the Rocky Mountain Institute ( USA ) proposed a complete set of
actions for curbing CO2 emissions, based on the use of innovative technologies. As a first
step he recommended to improve the efficiency in the energy end use, In the area of
transport, he advocated to reduce the weight of vehicles by using new materials such as
light alloys, light steel and carbon composites. As a second step, a future reduction in CO2
emissions can result through the use of alternative fuels, biofuels first and hydrogen later
on. In his view such a strategy cannot only result in reducing risk of climate change but
also help to build a competitive industry.
During the Round Table which followed, two further participants gave their vision of the
future. Giorgio Simbolotti from the Canadian University of Victoria, insists upon the
catastrophe which climate changes may represent in the future. For him, hydrogen as a
energy vector will be critical for the future. Although he shares many of the views
expressed by Amory Lovins, Scott considers that nuclear energy is needed. Fuel cells are
to be considered as an embedded technology, which can find a market if it incorporates
progresses similar to those which have been accomplished with computer silicon chips,
especially by miniaturizing the equipment, according to Scott. Yet for Amory Lovin, our
visions for the future should take into account innovation and not only rely upon
econometrics.
In conclusion Olivier Appert stated that because this issue of climate change is so
immediately crucial, we have to take into account all options which could help to reduce
CO2 emissions.
二、與會心得
All WHEC2006 participants are cordially invited to attend the 17th World Hydrogen
Energy Conference at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Center in Queensland,
Australia, June 15-19, 2008. The Conference theme –Supplying Energy to A Changing
World –will focus on how hydrogen can be used to deliver clean power to a world that
traditional sources such as oil for transport are in decline. The meeting will bring together
leading speakers from governments, industry and academia from around the world. They
will come to Brisbane to share their knowledge, initiatives, insight and experience through
keynote and plenary sessions. An exhibition will also form an integral component of the

一、參加會議經過
Anaerobic Digestion 11th World Congress in Brisbane, Australia
On the first day, Willy Verstrate, the professor of Ghent University gave a opening speech
and reviewed the evolution of world energy demand in the 21st century. First of all, he
asserted that the primary oil demand is increasing at an astonishing rate. With only few
major oil producers and high-risk countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq,
consumers are confronted with serious security supply issues. Prof. Verstrate also gave a
short talk of microbial fuel cell in this speech. The fuel cell has been known for almost as
long, since Grove successfully reversed the action of the electrolysis of water, recombining
hydrogen and oxygen to produce water and electrical current. Some of the simple
chemicals, like hydrogen or methanol, would be applied as the fuel in the fuel cell.
However, the hydrogen and methanol are not the only possibilities. After the bio-catalysts
applied in the fuel cell device, many of the organic compounds, like sugars, organic acids,
or alcohols, could be oxidized on the anode then generated current. Some studies even
reported that the current could be generated from waste water.
To summarize, the mocrobiologists faces three major challenges: energy supply, security,
and environmental issues. IEA believes that World Alternative Policy Scenarios (WAPS)
must be set into action in order to improve the energy-environmental situation worldwide.
Better efficiency of energy utilization, less tension in and around the countries at risk, and
greater investments in the New Energy Policy must be the initial steps towards change.

Hydrogen, environment and sustainable development
During three day’s plenary session chaired by J. Keller, Chairman, the main issues linked
with energy, climate change and sustainable development brought several viewpoints to
light. After all the plenary sessions, a technical tour was held, and the world first pilot scale
of Microbial fuel cell was exhibited. A pilot scale microbial fuel cell (MFC) has recently
been constructed at a brewery in the Brisbane area. The design power production is 500
W at a rated organic loading rate of 10 kg COD (chemical oxygen demand) per cubic
metre of reactor per day. The total reactor volume is 2.4 m³, divided into 24 100-litre
independent MFC modules. Each module is a cylinder with height of 3 metres and
diameter of 0.2 metres. Each cylinder is made out of a cation exchange membrane, which
separates the anode (inside) from the cathode (outside). This modular design enables low
internal resistance, estimated at less than 0.01 Ohm per cylinder. The anode and cathode
are made of graphite fibre brushes, with stainless steel rods as current collectors. The
cathodic process is bio-catalysed oxygen reduction. The anode influent is a pre-acidified
brewery wastewater, with a COD of approximately 5,000 mg/litre, at least half of which
comprises volatile fatty acids and sugars. A sequential anode-cathode configuration will be
implemented to enable COD polishing and proton transfer from anode to cathode. The
voltage from each cylinder will be converted to 12 V DC and the power generated will be
used to drive an electrical device.
二、與會心得
All AD11 participants are cordially invited to attend the 12th Anaerobic Digestion at the
German, June 15-19, 2009. The Conference theme –Supplying Energy to A Changing
World –will focus on how hydrogen and methane can be used to deliver clean power to a
world that traditional sources such as oil for transport are in decline. The meeting will bring
together leading speakers academia from around the world. They will come to Brisbane to
share their knowledge, initiatives, insight and experience through keynote and plenary
sessions. An exhibition will also form an integral component of the AD11, showcasing the
latest in technology from leading developers in the global hydrogen and fuel cell industry.
二、中文摘要
為促進國立成功大學環工系與新加坡南洋理工大學土木環工系雙邊
合作關係，我係先主動前往新加坡拜訪新加坡南洋理工大學。此次行程共
兩天一夜，包含一天的小型研討會，主要是由雙方老師及我方的幾名學生
來報告兩邊所正在進行的研究領域，藉由這樣的報告方式，讓我們可以較
快的對新加坡南洋理工大學所研究的領域有所認知，且互相在簡報上的內
容作交流，最後，我們也與他們簽訂雙方的協議書，也邀請他們明年度來
台灣國立成功大學環工系走訪一趟。除了一天的報告行程外，我們參訪了
他們的實驗室及研究大樓，讓我們看到一個乾淨的研究環境，以及他們牆
上精美的研究成果展示，這點是我們也該效仿的地方。最後一天下午，則
是城市巡禮了，行走幾個新加坡的景點，讓我們的旅程有個美好的結尾。
三、本文
1. 目的
促進成功大學環工及永續研究中心與新加坡南洋理工土木與環工兩校
間的國際合作
2. 過程
此次行程一共兩天，第一天是由我校與對方師生的小型研討會報告(table
1. 有議程資料)，使雙方了解兩校所研究的方向以及一些成果，當天老師
們也有進行兩校合作的會議及簽定合約書的程序，而晚上則是由新加坡南
洋理工大學的人員招待我們到他們學校的招待餐廳吃晚飯。第二天，是一
天的參觀行程，首先我們參觀他們系上的實驗室，跟我們不太一樣的是，
他們是屬於公共的實驗室，做同一領域的老師ㄧ同使用公共實驗室，也參
觀了他們系上的儀器設備，設備和我們這邊大同小異，都是屬於蠻完善。
接著我們到他們新的環境工程研究中心，裡面就包含了分子生物、固體廢
棄物等…一些分析設備，那在這裡比較像是一個研究中心，在走道上都是
掛著他們成果的海報，可以讓我們更加了解這裡研究及發展。最後，我們
拜訪了他們的工學院的院長，(prof. Pan Tso-Chien) 教授，他是台灣人，
是成大土木與環工系畢業，算是成大的傑出校友之ㄧ，同程的老師溫清光
