curious pattern formation of dense colloidal suspensions observed previously in the 
experimental work of Acrivos and his coworkers. The phenomenon involves field-induced 
dipole-dipole alignment and dielectrophoretic interactions. Saintillan and his student have done 
quite beautiful simulations to elucidate the effects at work.

[1,2], but also can be used to decode genetic barcodes [3]. A judicious control of the DNA motion in 
nano/micro structures further provides renewed strategies for separation of DNA on a gel-free basis [4,5]. 
Also because DNA is a charged and extendible polymer that permits physical and chemical binding to other 
substances, it can also serve as a molecular template, in concert with appropriate tailoring of its conformation, 
for realizing self assembly of nanostructures with functionalized building blocks [6]. 
However, as a genomic DNA is typically a long molecular chain in the size of 10-1000 kbp and 
naturally in the random coiled form, it must first be unraveled prior to any specific manipulation or before any 
genetic information can be extracted from it. To do so, it not only requires stretching a DNA to a linear 
configuration, but also necessitates stretching forces to be sufficiently large to counteract persistent recoiling 
forces on the chain for sustaining its extension. In other words, a successful stretch entails the characteristic 
relaxation time τrelax of an elongated DNA to be sufficiently long compared to the time scale τ associated with 
the applied stretching force. That is, the Deborah number De = τrelax /τ must be an order of unity or larger. For 
the most commonly used DNAs such as λ-DNA (48.5kbp) and T4 DNA (165.6kbp), their relaxation times are 
of an order of seconds or less in typical buffer solutions. To stretch these DNAs to 10-100μm in length, a 
force must be applied such that local velocity variations over the chains reach as high as 100μm/s. As the 
required force field will be extremely high, it is more desirable to pull DNAs in small-scale environments. In 
addition, when length scales are down to nano or submicron levels, a DNA must inevitably change its 
conformation to minimize the free energy for compensating the entropy loss due to confinement [4], which 
provides an added advantage to control the manipulation. 
Because of the above reasons, it is quite appealing to utilize nano- and microfabrication techniques to 
facilitate manipulation of DNA. Many strategies have been developed along this line. By tethering a DNA on 
a surface or attaching it to a bead, one can stretch it by pulling it at its free end by hydrodynamic flows [7], 
electric fields [8], and optical/magnetic tweezers [9,10]. One can stretch free DNAs with force/field gradients 
induced by non-uniform geometries or flow designs such as cross slots [11,12], converging channels [3,13], 
and hydrodynamic focusing [14]. Other techniques are also shown effective to stretch DNAs, including 
hooking DNAs over obstacles [15], electrophoretically driven reptation in gel matrices or nanopillar arrays 
[16], re-directing  DNAs in nanoslits [17], and combing them onto a surface by a moving interface [18,19]. 
The up-to-date development for linearization of DNA can be found in the recent review [20].

by PDMS and fabricated with standard photolithography techniques. After sealed by a glass substrate and 
assembled with tubing, the entire device is treated by plasma exposure for 1~ 3hr, where the plasma is 
operated at radio frequency of 8-12 MHz, power of 29.6 W, and vacuum in 0.1-0.3 torr. 
     The DNA solution was prepared by adding T4-DNA (165.6 kbp, Nippon Gene) of 3μg/ml in a pH=8 
buffer solution containing 10mM Tris-HCl solution, 10mM NaCl, and 2mM EDTA with the addition of 4% 
2-mercaptioethanol. The T4 DNA molecules were labeled with YOYO-1 fluorescence dye at a basepair-to-dye 
ratio of 5:1. We further added 2.2% Tween 20 non-ionic surfactant (MW=1228, Sigma) to the solution for 
preventing the droplet from being in contact with the channel wall. The conductivity of the solution is about 
2000 μS/cm and the corresponding thickness of the electric double layer is 2 nm. 
The generation of droplet was carried out in a cross-slot microchannel according to the following 
procedures. We first filled the solution in the channel followed by injecting silicone oil (50cp, Fluka) of 100μl 
/hr in the horizontal portion of the channel. After pumping the solution and silicone oil at the respective flow 
rates of 43μl/hr and 100μl/hr, a closely fitting oil droplet of 550μm in length was created in the channel, 
displacing the solution ahead and hence forming a thin liquid layer behind. This microdroplet was then 
re-directed to the observation channel (of 200μm in width and 120μm in height) for stretching DNAs. By 
flowing latex particles in different sizes into the film, the film thickness is estimated as 0.92 μm, as larger 
particles are blocked by the constriction whereas smaller ones can enter the film. The motion of DNA was set 
by dc voltage ranging 7−70 V with the corresponding electric field 30−300 V/cm within the film. DNA 
molecules within the film were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 2000S) with a 100X oil 
immersed objective lens. The motion was recorded by an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Cool 
SNAP HQ2, Roger Scientific). 
 
3. Entropic Trapping, Escape, and Translocation of Single DNA Molecules within Interfacial 
Constriction   
     Upon an application of an electric field, a DNA migrates toward the positive pole due mostly to 
electrophoresis because of negative charge on its backbone, while the droplet still remains stationary (unless 
the applied voltage is higher than 90 V). Since DNAs remains coiled in the bulk and has the radius of gyration 
Rg =0.97±0.16 μm (taken from our images), they tend to be hindered by the submicron constriction imposed 
escape from the trap, is  
ΔFmax / kBT ≈ − (2RB g/h)  + (E5/3 0/E) ,                      (1) 
with E0 = (kBT/ )/(4αημ ) representing the characteristic field for the activation. At weak fields, the 
barrier is infinitely high and hence DNA molecules will be completely trapped by the constriction. Thereby, 
the onset of translocation occurs at the threshold field 
B pA pA
 Ethreshold ≈ (h/2Rg)5/3E0,                         (2) 
beyond which a DNA molecule can overcome the entropic barrier.  
With the activation energy (1), we can obtain the trapping time through the Arrhenius law:   
τtrap = τ0 exp(ΔFmax /kBT) =τB contact exp(E0/E).              (3) 
Here τcontact = τ0 exp(−(2Rg /h)5/3)= τ0 exp(−E0/E threshold) is the contact time whose inverse measures the 
frequency of a coiled DNA in touch with the constriction; the larger coil, the more monomers can be exposed 
to the constriction and hence render the more probability per unit time to overcome the barrier [4]. Figure 3 is 
an Arrhenius plot for the measured trapping time of T-4 DNA against 1/E and clearly shows the exponential 
relationship predicted by the model. In addition, with the fitted slope E0 = 117. 1 V/cm, we obtain the 
threshold field Ethreshold = 33.8 V/cm which is in good agreement with 28.5 V/cm observed in the experiment. 
 
4. Anchoring, Cyclic Stick-Slip Phenomenon, and Surface Electrophoresis 
    After translocation, stretched DNA molecules will take a shuttle with the descending energy ladder set by 
the applied field. They, however, do not fully relax back to coils as travelling through the film. Instead, as 
shown in Figure 4, these 
DNAs exhibit a peristaltic creeping motion along the surface accompanied by “stick-slip” behavior with their 
cyclic stretching/recoiling tails. In some cases, they can even be stuck completely onto the surface.  
The observed DNA motion is likely attributed to occasional anchoring of elongated DNA chains to the 
surfactant sea on the surface. As illustrated in Figure 5, near the surface which is hydrophilic owing to plasma 
oxidation, surfactant molecules tend to re-orient themselves with their hydrophilic heads toward the surface 
while leaving their hydrophobic tails exposed in the bulk phase of the film, which in turn forms a surfactant 
monolayer brush of about 10nm in thickness on the surface. As an unraveled DNA also exposes its less 
 10
electrophoretic mobility according to the well-known “free-draining” picture [24].  
       Following Ref. 22, the field-dependent behavior of the translational mobility μtrans found in Figure 6 
can be written in the simple form:  
μtrans =μ∞ (1−Es/E),                          (4)  
with μ∞ being the mobility of a free DNA when the applied field E is sufficiently high. Here, Es (<E) is the 
least field required to drive the DNA by overcoming the surface drag, which depends upon the fraction of a 
DNA chain dragged on the surface and the friction coefficient between the chain and the surface. It is also 
clear that E must be higher than Ethreshold. Fitting the curves in Figure 6, we find μ∞ = (6.06±0.098) ⋅ 10-4 
cm2/(s⋅V) and Es = 14.75 V/cm for T4 DNA. For phi X 174 DNA, μ∞ = (5.73±0.12) ⋅ 10-4 cm2/(s⋅V) is close to 
that of T4 DNA, but Es = 7.36 V/cm is smaller than that of T4 DNA. With Eq. (4), it takes the translation time 
of τtrans =L/(μtransE) for a DNA to cross the film of length L. Also because a DNA is trapped at the entrance 
before entering the film, the entire trip will take time τ = τtrap + τtrans. As the mobility is inversely proportional 
to the associated time scale, the apparent mobility becomes  
1 /
trans trans trans
app
trap trans trans trapE L
μ τ μμ τ τ μ τ= =+ + .                     (5) 
It thus follows that μapp is controlled by the process with the longer time scale. That is, in the “translation” 
limit τtrans > τtrap, μapp ≈ μtrans; otherwise, μapp ≈ (L/E)/τtrap in the “trapping” limit τtrans < τtrap.   
     Eq. (5) furnishes the basis for potential applications in DNA separation using our system. Compared to 
the scheme using non-uniform nanoslits [4,5], ours is distinct from theirs in the following aspects. First, as the 
confinement here can be readily created by two phase flows in a microchannel, standard photolithography 
techniques can be employed to create an interfacial constriction at the submicron level without needs in direct 
fabrications of nano structures. Second, having the unique anchoring of DNA molecules to surface surfactants 
and its combination with entropic trap, our scheme offers a new means to selective fractionation of DNA 
molecules on a gel-free basis. Third, as the mobility of DNA now can be regulated by the film thickness and 
length via a suitable control of the droplet size, our platform has an ability to manipulate the DNA movement 
and hence provides a tunable control on DNA separation.    
     
5. Dynamic Template for Molecular Combing and Assembly of DNAs

Upon an aggregate forms, it tends to trap water molecules through the hydrophilic backbones of the entangled 
DNAs, behaving like a swollen globule with buildup of osmotic pressure therein. For an aggregate of size R 
containing monomers of number n, the osmotic pressure is Π ~ kBT n/R  according to van’t Hoff law and 
hence scales like R , where m = 3 −1/ν ranges between 1 and 4/3 by following R ∝ n  with the corresponding 
exponent ν = 1/2 and 3/5 for ideal and swollen chains respectively. Hence, a larger aggregate acts like a lower 
pressure “sink”, prone to draining its surrounding smaller aggregates toward it. As a result, small aggregates 
will coalesce due to size difference and larger clusters will continue to grow by attracting smaller ones, giving 
rise to collective flocculation of DNA molecules. According to the Kedem-Katchalsky law, the sink induced 
by a larger aggregate creates an inward osmotic flow of velocity U
B
3
−m ν
s ~ Lp Π around its periphery, where Lp 
measures the hydraulic permittivity of the water flow. For small aggregates in a distance r away from the sink, 
the former will then be drifted toward the latter at speed of U ~ Us (R/r) due to the local osmotic flow (Here 
the flow can be thought nearly two-dimensional, as it occurs on the surface). As such an osmotic suction 
decays at the rate of r , DNAs can be trapped remotely, thereby leading to the observed long-range 
flocculation at the mesoscopic scale.

We also found surprisingly that the combing formed at a higher field can even develop to DNA bundles 
after turning off the field, as shown in Figure 9. These bundles appear aligned to the prior field direction, 
suggesting that there exists a memory effect, as stretched DNAs must necessarily maintain their extensions 
during the aggregation. Alternatively, the relaxation time of stretched DNA chains is much longer (due to 
much stronger surface binding) than the time scale associated with the aggregation between the chains (due to 
much denser combing). More precisely, the phenomenon is attributed to a unique combination of 
surfactant-assisted combing, short-range crosslinking, and long-range osmotic attraction of stretched DNA 
molecules. Having anchoring effects enhanced by increasing the surfactant brush density on the surface, 
DNAs can have more extension under applied fields and hence retain stronger binding to the surface. Because 
more DNAs can be fed into the film and combed onto the surface at high fields, one can obtain much denser 
combing of DNAs, hence rendering themselves to become more susceptible to undergoing interchain 
attraction due to short-range van der Waals effects. As long extension of DNA molecules now can prolong the 
chain relaxation, combed DNA crowds will have time to crosslink laterally, forming entangled aggregates 
over the as-stretched micron-sized chains. These aggregates then continue to grow into larger islands due to 
 16
features. First, the fabrication of this platform is straightforward without the needs in complicated channel 
designs, hence providing a relatively simple approach for manipulation of DNA at the single-molecule level. 
Second, as the confinement can be adjusted by the droplet and channel dimensions, this provides a tunable 
control on the motion and deformation of DNA. Third, the behavior of the DNA motion can be further 
mediated by surface or/and surfactant effects, which offers a new paradigm for manipulation of DNA. Finally 
and most importantly, a diversity of manipulations, such as stretching, separation, molecular combing and 
dynamic assembly, can be achieved on a single miniaturized platform.

with a zero cycle-averaged extension, as expected. In a traveling electric field, 
on the contrary, the chain can be periodically pulled by subsequent strokes of 
the field without being fully contracted, and therefore can exhibit some 
extension during a cycle. And yet, the chain will not stretch at all if the field 
travels too fast. The detailed response would depend on the Deborah number, 
the ratio of the elastic force to the stretch force, and alpha, the ratio of the 
traveling field speed to the characteristic electrophoretic velocity of the chain. 
We not only show how the stretching is characterized by these parameters, but 
also provide the criteria for realizing the stretching in terms of electrode 
dimensions, the chain size, and the strength and frequency of an applied 
traveling field. 
二、與會心得 
   The session I attended is in the area of microfluidics with an emphasis 
on small scale phenomena under the influence of magnetic and electric 
field. So this session actually covered a broad range of topics, including 
colloidal suspensions, interfacial flows, electrokinetic phenomena, and 
polymers. The most impressive work I saw is Saintillan’s study to explain 
curious pattern formation of dense colloidal suspensions observed 
previously in the experimental work of Acrivos and his coworkers. The 
phenomenon involves field-induced dipole-dipole alignment and 
dielectrophoretic interactions. Saintillan and his student have done quite 
beautiful simulations to elucidate the effects at work.
