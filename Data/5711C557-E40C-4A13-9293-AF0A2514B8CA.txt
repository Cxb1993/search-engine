Abstract 
The aim of this research project was to develop optical as well as amperometric enzyme and 
nanomaterial based biosensors for detection of pesticides. During the first year, the objectives 
were to screen some of the enzyme and nanomaterials for the formation of nano-bioconjugates to 
develop a fast, reliable and economical analytical method for the determination of trace amounts 
of pesticides. For these purpose, novel bio-composite matrix including fenugreek gum (FG) and 
agarose (A) was used for enzyme and nanoparticles immobilization. Different enzymes 
(Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Tyrosinase (Tyr)) and nanoparticles (Gold nanoparticles 
(GNPs), silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) were screened during the 
initial screening process. Also, different pesticides including carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl and 
oxamyl were tested. After the screening, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and gold 
nanoparticles (GNPs) were selected for optical biosensor preparation due to their high sensitivity 
and better response. The enzyme stability was found to be markedly improved due to 
immobilization. The sensor performances for linear range, lower detection limit, reproducibility, 
stability, etc. were checked in due course. The Limit of detections for different pesticides of the 
current system was found to be way below than that of the prescribed MRL values of Taiwan 
FDA. The real sample testing was also done to prove the practical applicability of the fabricated 
optical biosensor. 
During second year, we tried to develop enzyme based electrochemical biosensors for pesticide 
detection with a better sensitivity and limit of detection. For this purpose we modified platinum 
electrodes by immobilizing enzyme and nanomaterials. The novel composite matrix was 
prepared using fenugreek and guar gum hydrogels for the first time in due course of study. The 
matrix with entrapped AChE and nanomaterials such as gold, silver and carbon nanomaterials 
was further characterized for its physical and chemical properties. The newly designed nano-

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme which stabilizes the levels of the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine by catalyzing the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ATC) to thiocholine (Du et al., 2010). 
Indeed, the inhibition of AChE activity by pesticides can lead to a disturbance of normal 
neuronal function and possibly death (Videira et al., 2001; Saez et al., 2006). Therefore the exact 
and speedy measurement of pesticides in water and food is of great importance. Biosensors based 
on AChE have emerged as a promising technique for toxicity analysis, environmental monitoring, 
food quality and military investigations in recent years (Alder et al., 2006; Tuba et al., 2009; 
Musameh et al., 2013). The main application of AChE biosensors is for the detection of 
organophosphate and carbamate pesticides based on enzyme inhibition. These devices are 
designed to complement or replace the existing reference analytical methods such as HPLC, GC, 
GC/MS and etc which offer powerful trace analysis with high reproducibility and very low 
detection limits. However, these techniques involve extraction of large volumes of water, require 
extensive purification, often including derivatization, and demand qualified personnel and 
expensive equipment (Culea et al., 2000; Stan et al., 2005; Du et al., 2010; Gaun et al., 2012). 
Thus, by simplifying or eliminating sample preparation, thus decreasing the analysis time and 
cost. Our research purpose is to develop a sensitive and stable nanomaterial based AChE 
biosensor for detection of pesticides to reach the same or more sensitive level of these analytical 
instruments.  
Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an annual herb, which belongs to the legume family 
widely grown in India, Egypt and Middle Eastern countries (Figure 1). Fenugreek gum (FG) is 
extracted from the endosperm of the Fenugreek seeds. The main polysaccharide present in 
Fenugreek seed endosperm is a galactomannan (galactose and mannose) which resembles the 
other galactomannans such as locust bean, guar gum and tara gum (Stephen and Churns, 1995 
and Youssef et al., 2009). FG was shown to reduce the glucose level in blood and regulate the

developing composite matrix using fenugreek and agarose sol-gel for fabrication of nanomaterial 
based pesticide biosensor. The novel matrix was prepared and used for immobilization of AChE 
enzyme along with different nanomaterials and employed for fabrication of optical biosensor.  
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1. Synthesis of nanomaterial 
 Our preliminary work was involved synthesis of various nanomaterials. We adopted easy, rapid 
techniques for preparation of nanomaterials. The key issue here was to control the size, shape and 
lateral dimensions of nanostructures because unique properties are dependent on these 
parameters.  
2.2. Gold nanoparticle synthesis  
Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) synthesis was undertaken after complete characterization of the 
stabilizer molecule. GNPs were synthesized according to previous report (Liu et al., 2006). 
Generally, 100 mL of HAuCl4 (1 mM) solution was heated to reflux with vigorous stirring and 
then 10 mL of 38.8 mM sodium citrate was quickly added. The color of the solution changed 
from pale yellow to wine red within 1 min. The solution was heated under reflux for another 20 
min and treated as GNPs solution after cooling. 
2.3. Silver nanoparticles preparation  
For the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), silver nitrate solution (from 1.0 mM to 6.0 
mM) and 0.3% (w/w) polyvinyl pyrrolidone were used as precursor and stabilizing agent, 
respectively. Hydrazine hydrate solution with a concentrate ranging from 2.0 mM to 12 mM and 
citrate of sodium solution (1.0 mM to 2.0 mM) were used as reducing agents. The transparent 
colorless solution was converted to the characteristic pale yellow and pale red color, when citrate 
of sodium was used as stabilizing agent. The occurrence of color indicated the formation of silver

achieve the lowest possible detection, only a minimum amount of enzyme must be used (Evtugyn 
et al., 1999; Bucur et al., 2004; Sotiropoulou et al., 2005).  
2.7. Film morphological studies by Scanning Electron Microscopy 
 To understand the distribution of enzyme molecules as well as respective nanomaterials in the 
immobilization matrix, the SEM analysis was performed.  
2.8. Kinetic study of nanomaterial-enzyme conjugates   
The kinetic parameters for the drop sensor were checked by different substrate concentrations 
and the rate of the reaction was calculated using Lineweaver-Burk plot and Km was checked for 
different systems.  
2.9. Effect of immobilization, pH and Temperature  
The response of enzyme sensing was tested at different pH and temperatures. The pH dependent 
studies of soluble and immobilized AChE were carried out using acetate buffer (pH 3.0–5.0), 
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0) and Glycine Sodium hydroxide buffer (pH 9-10). Enzyme 
sensitivity for temperature was studied within the range of 0–100 C.  
2.10. Fabrication reproducibility and Storage Stability 
The fabrication process of dip-strips was evaluated for suitability of the novel composite material 
used. Adhesion of the membrane to plastic support was the key point during these studies. A set 
of 10 experiments in different batches were carried out to check reproducibility. The storage 
stability of the dip-strips was checked with regular interval of time when stored at 4◦C under dry 
conditions. 
2.11. Response curve and limit of detection (LOD) 
The inhibition profile of the fabricated dip-strips was checked using different pesticides. For 
these purpose different pesticides such as carbaryl (Carbamate pesticide), carbofuran (Carbamate

3. Results and discussion 
For pesticide detection, the nanomaterial-enzyme based optical biosensors were fabricated and 
characterized.  The enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and tyrosinase (Tyr) were used for 
pesticides detections. The reaction schemes for the two enzymes are listed as follows: 
 
Scheme 1: Estimation of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity from Electrophorus electricus. 
 
Scheme 2: Estimation of Tyrosinase (Tyr) activity from mushroom Agaricus bisporus. 
3.1. Fabrication of dip-strip for optical sensor 
The polymer composite matrix was prepared using 2% (w/v) fenugreek gum and 2% (w/v) 
agarose. The gels were prepared separately and mixed together in equal amount at 60C. The 
enzyme and respective nanomaterials were added to the composite gel of FG-A mixture after 
14 
 
showed the SEM image of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) embedded in the agarose 
fenugreek gum membrane.  
 
Figure 3: SEM image of (A) GNPs-AChE (B) AgNPs-AChE and (C) MWCNT-AChE in 
fenugreek gum-agarose sol-gel film (The white bar as the inset refers to 1 µm scale).  
16 
 
The AgNPs concentration at this level was found to have inhibitory effect on AChE with slow 
and low optical response. Therefore GNPs and CNTs based FG-A-AChE systems were chosen 
for further studies. The immobilization efficiencies for the FG-A-AChE-GNP, FG-A-AChE-CNT 
and FG-A-AChE-AgNP were found to be 114%, 103% and 31% respectively.  
3.4. Response characteristics of the choline biosensor 
Depending upon the process curve and sensitivity, FG-A-AChE-GNP drop test sensor was 
selected for further studies. Figure 5 shows the typical response current–time curve of the choline 
biosensor after the successive addition of 5 mM acetylthiocholine to the phosphate buffer 
solution under stirring. A clearly defined change in optical density was observed, and the sensor 
responses quickly after the addition of choline, the response time was about 5 mins. The fast 
response is because of the porous structure of the sol–gel matrix through which acetylthiocholine 
can diffuse easily to reach the enzyme.

stored at 4 ◦C under dry conditions (Figure 7B). The drop in enzyme activity with storage 
duration was monitored and it was observed that the half life (loss of 50% of activity) for soluble 
enzyme was less than 10 days. While, after immobilization the half life increased to 55 days. 
Thus the dipstrips have a considerable amount of storage stability which improved to a great 
extent as compared to the soluble enzyme. 
 
Figure 7: Fabrication reproducibility (A) and storage stability (B) of the FG-G-AChE-GNP dip-
strips. 
3.7. Detection of pesticides  
Inhibition effects were investigated by measuring the biosensor response towards pesticides after 
inhibited by different concentrations of carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl and oxamyl, respectively. 
The calibration plots of inhibition percentage versus pesticides concentration were calculated to 
obtain the working dynamic range and limit of detection (LOD) values for the respective 
pesticides. The wide concentration inhibition profile and linear relationships between inhibition 
percentage and the concentration of pesticides were obtained and shown in Figure 8. From the 
LOD values we could conclude that the current dip strip system is capable of detecting pesticide 
levels much below than that of the prescribed maximum residual (MRL) values allowed by 
Taiwan government (Table 1).

3.8. Application of FG-A-AChE-GNP dip- strips: Real sample testing 
The fabricated dip-strips were checked for their practical reliability using fruit and vegetable 
samples. Fruits and vegetable juices were spiked with pesticides and tested using the dip-strips. 
The results are as given below. The results indicate that the dip-strips possessed good detection 
precision and reproducibility (Table 2).

Second-Year Research Project Report 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Pesticides are intentionally toxic, often towards non-target organisms and their intentional release 
into the environment has serious environmental consequences. Three classes of pesticides have 
been problematic, namely organochlorines, organophosphates and carbamates. 
Organophosphates pesticides, which are commonly used in agricultural practice, are highly 
neurotoxic to human beings and other animals in our ecosystems (USEPA, 2001; Zourob et al., 
2007; Shang et al., 2011; Viswanathan et al., 2009). Gas chromatography, liquid chromatography 
or combinations are the traditional analytical techniques for identification and quantity 
determination of pesticide residue. Nonetheless, the heavy and expensive equipment, the time-
consuming and complex procedures and the requirement of highly skilled technicians made these 
methods unsuitable for field usage. For the past few years, various inhibition and non-inhibition 
biosensor systems based on the immobilization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or 
organophosphorus hydrolase onto various electrochemical, piezoelectric or optical transducers, 
have been used to detect organic phosphorous residue (Halamek et al., 2005). Many studies have 
focused on techniques to enhance the sensitivity, stability and reproducibility for the biosensor 
and to improve the efficiency of enzyme immobilization.    
In recent years, electrochemical biosensor techniques have made encouraging progress 
and drawn people's wide concern due to the advantages of low cost, easy operation, fast response 
and high sensitivity (Mishra et al., 2012). The catalytic activity of AChE is inhibited by trace 
amounts of pesticides. Biosensors based on AChE have found environmental applications in the 
detection of pollutants such as OP and carbamates (Sinha et al., 2010 and Stoytcheva et al., 2009). 
26 
 
The ability of many water/electrolyte soluble polymers (WSPs), such as guar galactomannan, to 
form molecular solutions when dispersed in water is important industrially, for example in food 
applications, and in controlling the release of drugs in the gastrointestinal tract. Certain WSPs, 
including guar, are also referred to generically as ‘soluble fiber’ and some of these fiber 
preparations are currently available on prescription in the UK and elsewhere (Wang et al., 2008). 
However, there have not previously been studies much on the use of such hydrocolloid 
polysaccharides as a source of practical and functional materials. 
 Guar gum (GG), which is a galactomannan extracted from the seed of the leguminous 
shrub Cyamopsis tetragonoloba, is one of the common hydrocolloid polysaccharides (Bagal and 
Karve, 2006). It has the structure consisting of a (1→ 4)-linked β-D-mannopyranose main chain 
with a branched α-D-galactopyranose unit at the 6-position (Figure 9).  
 
 Figure 9:  Cyamopsis tetragonoloba herb with green pods, dried seeds and primary structure of 
guar gum (GG).  
Although GG has often been considered as a substitute for starch in many applications, very few 
attempts have been made to prepare new materials using it (Prasad et al., 2009; Mine et al., 2010; 
Bagal-Kestwal et al., 2011).  
28 
 
 
Figure 10A: SEM image of gold (A), carbon nanotubes(B) and silver (C) nanoparticles 
immobilized in fenugreek gum-agarose composite matrix. Figure 10B: TEM image of silver 
nanoparticles entrapped in fenugreek gum-guar gum composite matrix at different magnifications.  
  
For nanotubes containing electrodes 5 kV were applied as accelerating voltage whereas 2 kV 
were used for the platinum coated electrode. Figure 10A shows the SEM image of the 
biopolymer film generated on the electrode surface by simple multilayered deposition. The fact 
that the images before (not shown here) and after first and multi-layer of the AChE-sol gel-
nonmaterial are identical in morphology, and are very thin polymer layer. It was obvious that the 
highly dispersed gold and silver nanoparticles (A and C) were unifromaly distributed in the 
biopplymeric matrix. However, CNT showed uniform aggreigation due to hydrophilic and 
30 
 
 
To form AgNPs incorporated SP/Pt electrode, the same protocol was repeated for four times. 
Finally, multilayer films electrodes were kept for at least 24 h at room temperature under dust 
free condition for efficient entrapment and thin film formation. The fenugreek-guar gum (FG-GG) 
biogel showed an absorption peak at 380 nm, which is due to the localized surface plasmon 
resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles. The spectra of the hydrogel film showed a relatively 
broad band which was rather unexpected. It could be indicative of a distribution of silver 
nanoparticles with larger particle size range. Another probable reason could be the 
immobilization of silver nanoparticle deep within the hydrogel film which may cause their 
spectral behavior to differ from those of isolated nanoparticles. The above constructed AChE 
biosensor was illustrated in Scheme 3.

AChE-CNTs/SPPtE electrode, (b) FG-GG-AChE-GNPs/SPPtE electrode and (c) FG-GG-AChE-
AgNPs/SPPtE electrode for 10 min. 
2.6. Optimization of amount of AChE and incubation time 
The amount of AChE immobilized on FGG-AgNPs/GCE was another important aspect. While 
the amount of AChE changed from 25 to 250 mU, the amperometric response of the biosensor 
increased and reached a maximum at 100 mU (Figure 13). When the amount of AChE exceeded 
150 mU, the amperometric response of the biosensor become almost stable. The fact is that less 
quantity of AChE results that the enzyme activity is not sufficient for the biosensor. But an 
excess of AChE results in increase of resistance and obvious lower the amperometric response of 
the biosensor. Thus, 100 mU of AChE was used in these experiments. 
34 
 
other pesticides, therefore considering the relations of analytical time with sensitivity and 
stability of the amperometric measurements, an exposure time of 10 min was chosen as the best 
compromise between the signal and exposure time. 
2.7. Optimization of stability of FG-GG-AChE-AgNPs/SPPtE biosensor 
In order to study bioactivity and stability of the biosensor, AgNPs was used to immobilize the 
AChE on the FG-GG-AgNPs/SPPtE as a protective membrane of the biosensor. The FG-GG-
AChE-AgNPs/SPPtE biosensor was continuously tested 10 times respectively in PBS (pH 8.0) 
with fresh addition of 5 mM ATC. The results show that AgNPs an FG-GG nanocomposite can 
immobilize effectively enzymes on the surface of screen printed platinum electrode to keep the 
enzyme activities and assist electrons to shuttle between the enzyme and SPPt electrode. The FG-
GG-AgNPs with RSD 7.6% also acts as a protective membrane for the AChE biosensors which 
in turn can improve the stability of the biosensor. 
2.8. Analytical performance of the Pt/Nanomaterial/Biopolymer/AChE biosensor 
With the voltammetric behavior of the biosensor was well studied by cyclic voltammetric and 
chronoamperometric experiments. The varying concentration of the carbaryl and other pesticides 
concentration were done, aiming to build up the calibration curves. The amperometric 
experiments were performed by polarizing the working electrode at 0.0 V for 5 s, followed by a 
potential step to +0.30 V for 60 s in a 0.2 mol L
−1
 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 8.0. The 
cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out using the initially optimized parameters 
such as scan rate (10 mV s
-1
, applied potential window +1 to -1 V, sensitivity 1x10
-3
 V in a 
electrolyte of 0.2 mol L
−1
 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 8.0. 
 The variation of pesticide concentration in the electrolyte, from 2.0 to 10 pM, promoted 
increasing inhibition in the diffusion currents of the cyclic voltammograms peak currents

and absence of oxamyl pesticide. Figure 15b: Standard inhibition curves of the FG-GG-AChE-
AgNPs/SPPtE biosensor for (A) methomyl, (B) carbaryl, (C) oxamyl and (D) carbofuran by 
cyclic voltammetry. 
For the fabricated biosensor, a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 pM was found for methomyl, 
carbaryl, oxamyl and carbofuran. The electrochemical sensitivity sequence for AChE was same 
as optical and the toxicity pattern was determined as carbofuran > oxamyl > carbaryl > methomyl. 
These values of the LOD are much more higher than previous reports (Fan et al., 2008; Sun et al., 
2013; Musameh et al., 2013) and also adequate to monitor contaminations with such pesticides. 
Therefore, the spike vegetable and fruit samples were used to test the application of fabricated 
biosensor. 
  2.9. Reproducibility and stability of the enzyme biosensor 
With the motivation for investigating FG-GG as an immobilization matrix, to fabricate a 
reproducible enzyme biosensor system, the reproducibility was evaluated by preparing electrodes 
38 
 
to be high sensitive (80%) even after a storage period of 35 days. The enzyme-nanomaterial 
entrapment system retained all its enzyme activity, in comparison with the free enzyme, which 
lost 90% of its original activity within this time frame. After that, the response slightly decreased, 
possibly due to the dissolution of the enzyme from the electrode, or its possible degradation over 
time. These results are very positive as previous sensors lost their activities in few days 
(Musameh et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013). 
2.10. Preparation of the fruit and vegetables samples and analysis of pesticides 
Different varieties of sprouts from the local market of Taipei, Taiwan and were purchased for the 
analysis of methomyl, carbaryl, oxamyl and carbofuran in the samples. The sprouts were cut/ 
chopped into small pieces and 50 g of these pieces were weighed and mixed in a blender with 
100 mL of 0.2 mol L
−1
 PBS, pH 8.0. The homogenized extract was filtered and centrifuged at 
10000 rpm for 30 min at 4C. The clear supernatant solution was used for the standard addition 
method. After spiking the solution with an appropriate amount of pesticides, the sample solution 
was allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. 
Recovery measurements were then performed with fabricated AChE-nanomaterial based 
biosensor. The samples were mixed and spiked to a concentration of 40 - 80 pM pesticide and 
incubated for 10 min and inhibition response was measure as mentioned above. The 
quantification experiments were carried out using 50 μL aliquots of the different vegetable 
extracts with and or without appropriate dilutions. The results indicate that the fabricated 
electrochemical biosensor is reliable and accurate in detecting pesticides from different sprouts 
samples Table 3.

matrix was prepared using fenugreek and guar gum hydrogels for the first time in due course of 
study. The matrix with entrapped AChE and nanomaterials such as gold, silver and carbon 
nanomaterials was further characterized for its physical and chemical properties. The newly 
designed nano-composite was further employed for modification electrochemical transducer. The 
fabricated electric probe was used for detection of pure pesticides samples via cyclic 
voltammetry and amperometric method. The developed sensor was also employed for spiked 
sample testing and the results were within the accepted limits. The Validation of the proposed 
sensor, reliability and precision of the system checked critically and were found to be excellent. 
Thus the proposed nanocomposite material based AChE sensor can be used in-field for vegetable 
and fruit samples from local markets with few further modifications. Thus we could successfully 
complete the fabrication of different type of AChE –nanomaterial based biosensors in two years 
project span.

NPY mRNA expression model for screening essences to determine if they are appetite stimulator or inhibitor. 
We cultured the olfactory nerve cells Rolf B1.T for 2 days, and then treated the cells with the known appetite 
inhibitor limonene and stimulator linalool. It was found that linalool could significantly stimulate NPY 
mRNA expression in 10 minutes, and limonene had opposite effect. Similar results were also found in 
primary olfactory ensheathing cells isolated from rats. Further clinical trials using human subjects found that 
when 10 min treatment was applied, linalool indeed increased serum NPY level in human peripheral blood. 
Limonene, on the other hand, decreased serum NPY level. Thus, NPY mRNA expression in Rolf B1.T cells 
could be used as an in vitro model for screening essences which may affect appetite. 
KEYWORDS: NPY, olfactory nerve cells, appetite, essences, linalool, limonene 
 
四、建議 
當今世界國際化之趨勢愈來愈明確，除了計畫主持人需要出席國際學術會議與各國
相關學者交流外，學生、博士後、助理等亦有需要參加國際學術會議，增長其見聞。
目前計畫所核定之經費往往不足以支應師生一起出國參加會議，可能應該考慮增列
之。
