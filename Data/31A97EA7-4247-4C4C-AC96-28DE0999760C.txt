II. CHANNEL MODEL 
Throughout the paper, the isotropic scattering environment 
is considered. For dual-hop multipath fading channels, at time 
instance t, let 1α t( )  and 2α t( )  be the Rayleigh fading factors of 
the S-R and R-D channels, respectively. In addition, let 0α t( )  
be another Rayleigh fading factor of the S-R-D path. 
At the destination, the received signal of the dual-hop S-R-
D channel is [1],[2]

transmitted from the source, and 1n t( )  and 2n t( )  are the zero-
mean white Gaussian noises at the relay and destination, 
respectively.  For Rayleigh fading channels, iα t( ) 0 1 2i =( , , )

A. Simple Dual-Hop Channel 
Let λ  be the unfaded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received 
at the relay. For the dual-hop fading channel, the equivalent

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, to evaluate the performance of the 
cooperative SC and MRC schemes, we compare the outage 
probabilities of different cases with two diversity branches.  
In Fig. 3, the outage probability versus the SNR threshold is 
plotted with the consideration of the dual-hop correlation, and 
the outage probabilities of individual dual-hop S-R-D and 
direct S-D paths without diversity are also depicted.

and variances 2 21 2σ = σ = 1.  
Based on the numerical results, the cooperative SC and 
MRC schemes can achieve 10-2 outage probabilities for those 
thresholds smaller than -7 dB, while the direct S-D path 
without diversity could not reach the outage for the threshold 
larger than -17dB and the correlated dual-hop path is even 
worse. For better outage probabilities smaller than 10-3, the 
cooperative SC and MRC schemes show their further gains, but

Abstract—The level crossing rates (LCR) and average fade 
duration (AFD) are derived and evaluated for correlated dual-
hop Rayleigh fading channels, where an amplify-and-forward 
(AF) relay with a fixed gain is considered. The underlying in-
phase and quadrature processes of a Rayleigh fading envelope 
are modeled, and their auto- and cross-correlation functions are 
derived. Based on the correlation functions, the LCR of 
correlated dual-hop Rayleigh fading channels is derived first. 
Then, the AFD is obtained. Numerical results of the LCR and 
AFD for different correlation coefficients are presented and 
compared.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A dual-hop transmission system employs a relay to 
retransmit the source signal to the final destination [1]. The 
dual-hop system has many advantages. For example, it can 
save the transmission power of the source and extend the 
communication range, which will significantly reduce the 
implementation complexity of the system. In addition, a relay 
channel can be applied to cooperative diversity systems. 
Among different retransmission policies, the AF relay results in 
an easy and effective scheme [2]-[5].   
The LCR of a faded signal is defined as the average rate at 
which the signal envelope crosses a given level, and the AFD is 
the average duration that the signal envelope becomes lower 
than the given threshold [6], [7]. Both the LCR and AFD are 
useful second-order statistics of fading channels, and they have 
various important applications in wireless communications, 
such as the burst error estimation [8], [9], the assessment of the 
switching rate of a diversity system [10], and analysis of the 
peak-to-average signal in the orthogonal frequency-division 
multiplexing (OFDM) [11].  
In [4], the LCR and AFD were analyzed for independent 
dual-hop Rayleigh fading channels. In [5], the LCR and AFD 
of cooperative selection diversity system were derived also for 
independent dual-hop fading channels. Nevertheless, for a 
dual-hop channel, since the two hop channels are associated 
with each other via a single middle station (i.e. relay), these 
hop channels are essentially correlated. To the best of our 
knowledge, the second-order statistics of correlated dual-hop 
channels have not been derived or studied. 
In the paper, we first model the in-phase and quadrature 
processes of a Rayleigh fading envelope, and derive their auto- 
and cross-correlation functions. Based on the correlation 
functions, the average LCR of correlated dual-hop Rayleigh 
fading channels is derived first. Then, the cumulative 
distribution function (cdf) of the correlated dual-hop Rayleigh 
fading factor is analyzed, and the AFD is obtained. 
 The paper is organized in the following way. In Section II, 
the correlated dual-hop fading channel is modeled and its 
second-order statistics are specified, where the probability 
density function (pdf) of a correlated dual-hop Rayleigh fading 
factor is obtained. In Section III, the LCR and AFD are derived 
for the correlated dual-hop Rayleigh fading channels. In 
Section IV, numerical results are presented. Conclusions are 
drawn in Section V. 
 
II. MODELING OF DUAL-HOP CHANNELS 
Throughout the paper, the isotropic scattering environment 
is considered for the fading model, and it is assumed that the 
propagation and processing delay at the relay is ignored (or 
compensated) by the destination, and the fading factors of the 
two hops are statistically dependent. For dual-hop fading 
channels, at time instance t, let 1( ) 0tα ≥  and 2 ( ) 0tα ≥  be the 
fading factors of the source-to-relay (S2R) and relay-to-
destination (R2D) channels, respectively.  
At the destination with a fixed-gain AF relay, the received 
signal of the dual-hop channels via the relay is given by [2], 
[4], [5] 
2 1 2 1 2( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )z t A t t s t A t n t n tα α α= + +  (1) 
where A is the relay gain, ( )s t  is the signal transmitted from 
the source, and 1( )n t  and 2 ( )n t  are the zero-mean white 
Gaussian noises at the relay and destination, respectively. It is 
assumed that 1n and 2n  in (1) have the same power spectrum 
density. Without loss of generality, the normalized value of 
1A =  is used throughout the paper.

The LCR of the dual-hop correlated fading channels is 
convex function of the threshold, and AFD is a monotone 
function, which is similar to the case of single-hop fading 
channels [7]. Based on the numerical results, the correlation of 
the dual-hop correlated Rayleigh fading channels will degrade 
the AFD in the deep fade region. This result is consistent with 
the intuition, where if one hop encounters a severe fade, the 
fade of the other hop will also be serious due to their 
correlation, which is different from the situation of 
independent dual-hop channels. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
To explore the second-order statistics, the average LCR and 
AFD of the dual-hop correlated Rayleigh fading channels have 
been derived, where the effect of the correlation is also 
illustrated. The LCR and AFD will supply useful information 
for the design of a wireless dual-hop system, particularly for 
the error correcting code and adaptive modulation.

Spatial Diversity with a New Sequential Maximal 
Ratio Combining over Wireless Fading Channels

Abstract—A new spatial diversity with sequential maximal ratio 
combining (S-MRC) is proposed and analyzed. In the S-MRC 
system, the diversity branches are added for combining one-by-
one in a sequential manner, and a truncated sequential 
probability ratio test (TSPRT) is used for signal detection. By 
sequentially adding individual branches for combining, the 
power consumption from directly using all available branches 
can be saved. The S-MRC is more power-saving than the 
traditional MRC or the output-threshold MRC (OT-MRC). 
Numerical results for the bit error rate (BER) of the BPSK 
signaling over the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) 
Rayleigh fading channels are presented to illustrate the 
performance of the S-MRC which is much better than the OT-
MRC and is identical to that of the traditional MRC if a suitable 
test threshold is used. Furthermore, the average number of active 
branches is much smaller than that of the traditional MRC. 
Keywords-diversity; maximal ratio combining (MRC); Rayleigh 
fading channel; sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
As well known, the spatial diversity combining technique 
provides an effective way to overcome the fading in wireless 
channels [1], [2]. Among different combining methods, MRC 
yields an optimal performance for coherent modulations. With 
MRC, the received branch signals are linearly summed, and a 
decision test based on the weighted sum is conducted for 
signal detection. On the other hand, MRC is the most power 
consuming due to the arithmetic operations of adder and 
multipliers used by the linear combination, which is 
undesirable from the viewpoint of saving energy. 
To save the power of MRC, the so called thresholded MRC 
(T-MRC) and OT-MRC have been explored recently [3]-[6]. In 
an OT-MRC system with L branches, instead of using the L 
branches directly, the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of diversity 
branches are partially summed and compared to a fixed 
threshold in a stacking manner, where one more SNR is added 
after each comparison if the threshold is not crossed in the 
previous comparison. Once the threshold is crossed by sL
( )sL L≤  summed SNRs, MRC is conducted with the sL  
signals, which makes the average number of actually used 
branches smaller than L and thus saves the power of signal 
combination. With the preprocessing of SNR summing and 
associated threshold-testing, the actually used branch for final 
signal combination and detection in the OT-MRC system is a 
random number. However, in the OT-MRC scheme [4], [5], the 
SNR summation and threshold-testing may consume more 
power. In addition, the OT-MRC results in performance loss 
compared to the traditional MRC. 
To explore a new MRC-based diversity scheme that not 
only saves the power of signal combining (compared to the 
traditional MRC) but also yields performance enhancement 
(compared to the OT-MRC), in this paper, the S-MRC scheme 
is introduced and  analyzed. The S-MRC employs the TSPRT 
[7]-[9] where the sample size of the decision test for signal 
detection is not fixed. More specifically, with total L branches, 
the sL -branch MRC is conducted (starting from 1sL =  to 
sL L= ) by comparing the weighted sum to two test thresholds 
as in a TSPRT system. With the S-MRC, the receiver will not 
use all the branches at once for a power-saving purpose, and 
the branches is added for combining one-by-one sequentially 
according to performance requirement. When ,sL L<  if the 
weighted sum of sL -branch MRC is within a region delimited 
by the two thresholds, one more branch is added to form a new 
weighted sum of ( 1)sL + branches and the same comparison to 
the two thresholds is conducted. Otherwise, if the weighted 
sum is outside the region defined by the two thresholds, a 
decision is made based on the sL -branch weighted sum.  The 
L-branch MRC is employed only if all 1L − branches have 
been used and the detection decision has not been reached.  
The S-MRC integrates the diversity combining and signal 
detection based on the TSPRT, where the preprocessing of the 
SNR summing and associated threshold-testing used by the 
OT-MRC [4], [5] is not required. Thus, it will be expected that 
the S-MRC not only outperforms the OT-MRC but also 
consumes less power since the TSPRT-based signal 
combination and detection is used.  
To illustrate the performance of the S-MRC, the dual and 
triple diversity schemes for BPSK signaling on i.i.d. Rayleigh 
fading channels are analyzed in the context. The S-MRC can 
be directly extended to the general multi-branch diversity. 
In Section II, the S-MRC is described. In Section III, the 
BER of S-MRC is derived. The average number of active 
branches is derived in Section IV. Numerical results are 
presented in Section V. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

Based on (7), (15), and (22), the BER for the S-MRC with 
triple diversity can be easily evaluated by a closed-form. 
Notice that obviously, the error probability given by (16) is 
upper-bounded by the BER of the traditional optimal MRC, 
i.e.,  
 ( ) ( )0 3 0 30, 3 0sP S L P S≥ = ≤ ≥  (23) 
where ( )0 3 0P S ≥  can be evaluated via an easier way [10]. By 
using the upper-bound, the evaluation of the triple-integral 
given by (16) can be avoided. 
IV. AVERAGE NUMBER OF ACTIVE BRANCHES 
In the S-MRC system, before sL L=  is reached, the 
number of active branches used for signal combination and 
detection is a random variable. As in the OT-MRC system, the 
average number of active branches reflects the power 
consumption of the S-MRC. 
A. Dual Diversity 
For 2,L =  after the test for signal detection is completed, 
the probability of only using one branch is  243
In summary, for the same ,γ  the BER gain of the S-MRC 
over the OT-MRC can be more than 10 dB when 2,L = and 
around 20 dB when 3.L =  Furthermore, for different values of  
,η  a considerable power gain of S-MRC over the OT-MRC 
can be obtained. For example, at BER=10-4, this power gain is 
around 10 dB when 2L =  (as shown in Fig. 1) and approaches 
15 dB when 3L =  (as shown in Fig. 3). These BER and power 
gains of S-MRC enlarge when γ  increases.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
To utilize the available spatial diversity branches in a 
power-saving manner and simultaneously achieve good 
reception performance, the S-MRC is proposed. Compared to 
the OT-MRC, the S-MRC has a lower average BER and is 
more power-saving since it does not require the preprocessing 
of SNR summing and associated threshold-testing. The S-MRC 
with a suitable test threshold can achieve the same performance 
as the traditional optimal MRC but saves much power in the 
average sense. The S-MRC can be directly extended to multi-
branch spatial diversity combining and digital signaling on 
other fading channels. In addition, the S-MRC concept can also 
be applied to cooperative diversity systems.
