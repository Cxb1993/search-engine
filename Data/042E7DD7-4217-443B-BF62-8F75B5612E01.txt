ABSTRACT 
In this investigation, an interferometric scheme is developed to determine the linear birefringent parameters of wave 
plate in full range. A commercially available Soliel Babinet compensator and a half wave plate are taken as sample to 
demonstrate the capability of two-dimensional measurement. Since images are obtained with respect to different 
polarization orientations of a linearly polarized incident laser beam, the measurement speed can be improved once 
the polarization orientation adjustment is achieved electronically. The measurement is also independent of 
non-uniform distribution of laser intensity, this is demonstrated experimentally and briefly explained theoretically. In 
addition, the 2-D distribution of residual linear birefringent parameters is also demonstrated.  
 
Linear birefringence, two-dimensional measurement, polarization rotating 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The wave plate such as quarter wave plate (QWP) or half wave plate (HWP) is one of the most important and widely 
employed anisotropic optical components. They serve a special purpose in polarimetric system to modify the state of 
polarization of light wave1-3. Since the measurement error may be introduced by imperfect wave plate4, especially the 
first order error introduced by HWP5, thus the knowledge of the homogeneity of linear birefringent parameters (LBP) 
of HWP is required in evaluating the quality of measured results. In general, LBP of a wave plate is defined by phase 
retardation ∆Φ that denotes the phase difference introduced by the wave plate to the eigen-polarized waves, and 
azimuth angle β of fast axis of the wave plate with respect to reference axis. We have proposed heterodyne6 and 
two-dimensional (2-D)7 techniques to characterize the LBP of QWP successfully, however, the former is based on 
single point measurement while the later is suitable only for QWP and both techniques are limited by the 
measurement range. Since ∆Φ of HWP may distributed around π while β may arbitrarily oriented, thus a LBP 
mapping technique for which ∆Φ in the range [-π, π] and β in the range [-π/2, π/2] is required. Recently, LBP 
measurement in the application of characterizing living tissue1, stress or strain analysis8, attracts a lot of interest due 
to its non-destructive and non-invasive nature. However, due to the mixing of isochromatic fringes with isoclinics 
and the LBP in living tissue or strained component may continuous distributed, the measurement of LBP in full range 
is more desirable. Therefore, many techniques are proposed to deal with this topic, such as phase shifting technique9, 
multiple wavelengths technique10 or multiple loading technique11. Further contributions to handle non-uniform 
distribution of the intensity distribution12, low level of LBP detection3 and different noise levels in high and low 
modulation area13 are also proposed.   
In this report, we present a homodyne interferometer with polarization rotating for the measurement of 2-D 
LBP of HWP with full range capability. In comparison with phase shifting technique, the distortion of reference 
of QWP and the transmission axis of LP are oriented at 0° and 45° respectively, the interferometric intensity 
distribution over the image plane is  
I(x,y)=|Eout(x, y)E*out(x, y)| 
 =I0[1+sin(2β)cos(2β-2θ)cos( ϕ∆ )+sin(2β-2θ)sin( ϕ∆ )sin(∆Φ)-cos(2β)sin(2β-2θ)cos( ϕ∆ )cos(∆Φ)] (5) 
where I0=|tE0|2, star denotes the complex conjugate and ϕ∆ =ϕ1 -ϕ 2  is the phase retardation introduced by QWP. If 
ϕ∆ =π/2, then the interferometric intensity distribution I(x,y) becomes IA(x,y) where 
 IA(x,y)=I0[1+sin(2β-2θ)sin(∆Φ)]             (6) 
It can be seen from Eq. (6) that IA(x,y) is a function of controllable parameter θ, which alters the intensity instead of 
phase. When the azimuth angle θ is adjusted at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° respectively, four independent intensity patterns 
are obtained 
 I0i=I0[1+sin(2β- 2(iπ/4))sin(∆Φ)]             (7) 
where i from 0 to 3 corresponds to θ at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° respectively. Then the azimuth angle β from -π/2 to π/2 
can be readily determined by four-quadrant arctangent

Since I0 is common to denominator and numerator, the effects of non-uniform distribution of laser intensity and 
position dependent transmission factor are reduced. The phase retardation ∆Φ can be determined by 
 sin(∆Φ)=

β
−                (9) 
where I0=(I00+I01+I02+I03)/4, the influence of I0 on the measurement of ∆Φ can also be reduced. But the range of ∆Φ 
according to Eq. (9) is from -π/2 to π/2, which is insufficient for some applications. Back to Fig. 1, if QWP is 
removed while the orientation of remaining components remain the same, this leads to ϕ∆ =0 in Eq. (5), then I(x, y) 
becomes IB(x,y) where 
 IB(x,y)=I1[1+sin(2β)cos(2β-2θ)-cos(2β)sin(2β-2θ)cos(∆Φ)]        
 (10) 
I1=|t’E0|2, t’ denotes the total polarization-independent amplitude transmission factor of optical system without QWP.  
Thus, another four independent intensity distributions can be found by orienting θ in the same way at 0°, 45°, 90° 
and 135° respectively, which yields 
 I1i=I1[1+sin(2β)cos(2β-2(iπ/4))-cos(2β)sin(2β-2(iπ/4))cos(∆Φ)]       
 (11) 
where i=0,1,2,3, the phase retardation ∆Φ is related to cosine function by 
 cos(∆Φ)=

and I1=(I11+I13)/2. Thus, ∆Φ can be determined in full range by combining Eq. (9) with Eq. (12) where 
 ∆Φ=arctan[

It is clear from Eq. (13) that I0 and I1 give no influence on the determination of ∆Φ and six frames are enough to 
determine 2-D LBP in full range. However, the system will be more robust if additional images I10 and I12 are 
recorded. 
 
3. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND EXPERMENTAL RESULTS 
Thus, the theoretical error δβθ  is directly proportional to δθ , which can be ignored if δθ  is small enough either 
by rotating HWP mechanically or electronically. The theoretical error )(∆Φδ θ  of ∆Φ are

for i=0..3, θ∂∂ /I1i  are similar to Eq. (15) with IA is replaced by IB since QWP is removed. Thus  
 )(∆Φδ θ =2tan(2β)sin(∆Φ)δθ             
 (18) 
Figure 5 shows the theoretical )(∆Φδ θ  as a function of β and ∆Φ under orientation error δθ =0.1°, )(∆Φδ θ  
becomes larger when β approaches 45°, this is indicated by Eq. (18) where tan(2β) approaches infinite as β 
approaches 45°. It is also noted that )(∆Φδ θ  closes to 0° as ∆Φ approaches 180°. In deriving Eq. (18), β is assumed 
perfect without error. Actually, β should be replaced by β+δβθ  in Eq. (13) where it is determined under orientation 
error θ +δθ . Thus, different )(∆Φδ θ occurs by taking into consider β and β+δβθ  respectively, however, this 
discrepancy can be neglected under δθ = 0.1°.   
 
4.2 Measurement error due to imperfect phase retardation of QWP 
In this section, the measurement error due to imperfect phase retardation of QWP is considered. This imperfection is 
generally occurred to the commercially available QWP. If the phase retardation ϕ∆  of QWP is replaced by π/2-δϕ  
where δϕ  denotes the imperfection of QWP and δϕ <<1. Then I(x,y) becomes IC(x,y) where 
 IC(x,y)=I0[1+sin(2β)cos(2β-2θ )δϕ -cos(2β)sin(2β-2θ )cos(∆Φ )δϕ +sin(2β-2θ )sin( ∆Φ )]  
 (19) 
From Eq. (19), four independent intensity patterns IC00, IC01, IC02, IC03 are determined corresponding to different 
orientations of linearly polarized laser beam at θ =0°, 45°, 90° and 135° respectively. Thus, the error δβ q  can be 
obtained by using Eq. (8)

The theoretical error δβ q  induced by δϕ  to the measurement of ∆Φ  can be derived from Eq. (13). Since I01, I03 
and β involved in the calculation of ∆Φ  in Eq. (13) are obtained with imperfect QWP, they should be replaced by 
IC01, IC03 and β+δβ q  respectively. The theoretical errors δβ q  as functions of β and ∆Φ  are shown in Fig. 6 where 
δϕ =0.5°. After similar mathematical treatment, the theoretical error )(∆Φδ q  is
