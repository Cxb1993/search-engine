and 3.3~3.6 GHz) bands all over the world.This 
standard provides high speed data transmission 
which contains fixed or mobile wireless access. 
Receivers in WiMAX systems are responsible for 
receiving of the high frequency signals. For 
universal WiMAX applications, it is essential to 
cover all frequency bands from 2.3 GHz to 5.8 
GHz. To meet the requirement of different 
frequency bands, a receiver front-end designed for 
the universal purpose is depicted in Fig. 1. Among 
the building blocks in the receiver front-ends, low 
noise amplifiers (LNAs) are added to amplify the 
small signals from antennas without causing any 
noise interferences. For simplification of various 
bands LNA design, it is intuitive to obtain a 
wideband circuit. Typically wideband LNAs 
constructed by using resistive feedback have been 
reported [1]-[6]. The characteristic of resistive 
feedback is to extend bandwidth by sacrificing 
gain. The common drawbacks of using resistive 
feedback are low gain and high power 
consumption due to high supply voltage.   
In this paper, an improved shunt-shunt 
feedback LNA is presented not only to increase 
the gain but also to save the power for universal 
bands. 
三、研究方法及成果 
The proposed LNA is shown in Fig. 2. The 
configuration consists of a common-gate input 
stage M1 and two resistive shunt feedback 
common-source stages, M2 and M3. The input 
stage is a common-gate amplifier which makes the 
broadband input impedance matching can be easily 
achieved. By controlling Vctrl in the gate of M1, the 
transconductance can be varied so as to conform to 
different operation conditions. The proposed LNA 
employs a gain compensation technique of a 
shunt-shunt feedback network with different 
resonance frequencies. The gain compensation 
technique exhibits a bandpass-like frequency 
response having a maximal flatness around the 
center frequency of the pass band. 
 
A. LNA Design 
Low power consumption is regarded as the 
prerequisite in LNA design. By using the cascade 
stages M2 and M3, sufficient gain and bandwidth 
can be achieved. L2 and L3 are inductors with high 
quality factors as the load. The bandwidth 
becomes narrow and can be expressed as 
Q
BW dB 03
ω=−             (1) 
LNA using a shunt-shunt feedback can obtain a 
good gain-bandwidth product.  
L1 not only compensates the imaginary part of 
the input impedance but also isolates the noise 
from the parasitic resistance provided by the next 
stage. No coupling capacitance between M2 and 
M3 stags are inserted. The cross-coupled RC 
feedback of M3 stage achieves the broadband gain. 
RLC of M2 stage obtains 50 Ω output matching.  
Besides, the source follower can be eliminated to 
further simplify the circuit. Therefore M3 stage not 
only provides the gain but also acts as an output 
buffer. L4 can compensate the gain within the high 
band. 
In the improved shunt-shunt feedback topology, 
the feedback resistor RF1 is responsible for 
promoting the overall gain within the desired 
wideband. When RF1 is increasing, gain is 
increasing but the input impedance matching 
condition becomes worse. The feedback structure 
which is different from the common resistive 
feedback network sacrifices gain to broaden 
bandwidth. 
 
B. Input Impedance Matching Stage 
The first stage is important for input matching. 
The common-gate topology has inherent wideband 
operating performance, good input-output isolation 
property, and better electrostatic discharge (ESD) 
protection than a common-source amplifier [7]. 
The simplified small-signal equivalent tank circuit 
of the input stage is shown in Fig. 3. The input 
impedance can be calculated as

As obtained from Table I, low power

which is superior to other wideband LNAs. 
四、結論與討論 
A tunable gain LNA is presented for universal 
WiMAX applications. The design configuration 
consists of a common-gate input stage and two 
resistive shunt feedback common-source stages 
which can be operated at low voltage. A tunable 
stage is added for adapting different environment. 
The wideband LNA obtains the power gain of 15 
dB for different frequency bands such as 2.5GHz, 
3.5GHz, and 5.8GHz. The proposed LNA uses 
novel resistive feedback to solve the problem of 
low gain. The proposed LNA achieves both good 
gain flatness and low power consumption which is 
useful for wireless systems especially in high gain 
purpose. Two research papers related to this 
project have been published in JEWMA2009[11] 
and ICUWB2009[12].

Abstract—A 0.7V tunable gain low noise amplifier (LNA) is 
presented for operation in direct sequential ultra-wideband (DS-
UWB) systems. The configuration consists of one common-gate 
input stage and two common-source stages. A variable resistor is 
added to the first stage for obtaining the tunable gain and 
increasing the linearity. The second and the third stages are 
cascaded by a resistive shunt feedback to extend the bandwidth. 
The proposed LNA is simulated by tsmc 0.18µm CMOS process. 
The gain tuning range is within 12.4 to 16.3dB. The input third-
order intercept point (IIP3) is between -1.2dBm and -7.8dBm. 
The -3dB bandwidth is from 1.8 GHz to 7.2GHz which is 
suitable for lower band of DS-UWB systems. The gain (S21) is 
15.3~16.3dB. The input/output reflection coefficients are both 
lower than -10dB. The minimum noise figure is 4.28dB. The 
power consumption is 7.2mW at 0.7V supply voltage. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
In 2002, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) 
approved the operation of certain type of wireless devices 
incorporating the ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, which 
transmits information using very low power, short impulses 
thinly spreading over a wide bandwidth. In order to receive 
signals within different frequency bands, a receiver front-end 
as depicted in Fig. 1 are required. Among the building blocks 
in the receiver front-ends, low noise amplifiers (LNAs) are 
added to amplify the small signals from antennas without 
adding significant noise. For simplification of wideband 
receiver design, it is intuitive to obtain a wideband circuit. A 
broadband LNA operated within 2-6GHz for the lower band 
of the direct sequential UWB (DS-UWB) receivers was 
presented [1]. Typically, wideband LNAs constructed by 
using resistive feedback had been consequently reported [2]-
[6]. The characteristic of resistive feedback is to extend 
bandwidth by sacrificing gain. The common drawbacks of 
using resistive feedback are low gain and high power 
consumption due to the demand of a high supply voltage. In 
this paper, an improved shunt-shunt feedback LNA is 
presented not only to increase gain among the full bandwidth 
but also to save power for lower band of DS-UWB receiver.

II. PROPOSED TUNABLE GAIN LNA 
The proposed LNA is shown in Fig. 2. The configuration 
consists of a common-gate input stage M1 and two resistive 
shunt feedback common-source stages, M2 and M3. The input 
stage is a common-gate amplifier which makes broadband 
input impedance matching easily achievable. By controlling 
Vctrl in the gate of M1, the transconductance can be varied so 
as to achieve different operating conditions. The proposed 
LNA employs a gain compensation technique of a shunt-
shunt feedback network with different resonance frequencies. 
The gain compensation technique exhibits a bandpass-like

nonlinear characteristics, s-parameter of circuits, and parasitic 
components of layout. The non-ideal factors must be taken 
into account before implementation the chip. The effects of 
input/output RF pads and dc pads have been considered in the 
circuit simulation.  
The transistor width is a compromise term between 
consumption current and noise figure. The width of M2 is set 
to be 120µm. L2 is chosen to be resonated at 2GHz. C3 and L3 
of the third stage are chosen to be resonated at 6GHz. The 
inductances of L2 and L3 are 3.8nH and 2.4nH, respectively. 
The relationship between RF1 and the gain is shown in Fig. 
5. The gain can be varied by choosing different RF1. In Fig. 6, 
the noise figure is between 4.28dB and 5.38dB over the 
frequency band.  
Fig. 7 shows the input/output reflection coefficients (S11 
/S22) are well below -10dB In Fig. 8, the proposed LNA with 
50Ω matching load can achieve the flat forward power gain 
(S21) of 15.8±0.5dB during 2GHz to 6GHz. The isolation (S12) 
is below than -33.9dB.  
The input 1dB compression point (P1dB) of -17.4dBm and 
the input third-order intercept point (IIP3) of -7.8dBm are 
achieved at 4GHz as shown in Fig. 9.  
The simulation results of gain and IIP3 with different Vctrl 
is shown in Fig. 10. Vctrl can be tuned from 0.55V (high 
linearity mode) to 1V (high gain mode). The gain tuning 
range is within 12.4dB to 16.3dB. IIP3 is between -1.2dBm to 
-7.8dBm. S11 are less than -10dB with different Vctrl as shown 
in Fig. 11.
