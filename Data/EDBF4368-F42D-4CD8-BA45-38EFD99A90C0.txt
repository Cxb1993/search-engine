一、中文摘要 
全世界的工業正朝向「更精密」與「更微
小」的領域邁進，台灣也不例外。半導體加工
精度與加工也隨之的不斷縮小，所以微細加工
的精度需求極高精密且不得容許些許的誤
差。另外半導體產業、微機械元件以及微機電
系統等元件的迅速發展，各類元件射出用模
具、成型自具的尺寸也越來越小，更加突顯微
細切削的重要性。本計劃擬以微細鑚切為研究
主題。在實際半導体電路板製程中，因封裝越
來越精密與小型化，使得鑚針也朝向越來越細
小甚至直徑小於 0.1mm，也造成進刀過程中微
鑚針常常斷裂。所以探討以超音波振動改善微
細鑚針之切削與動態特性與挫曲斷針機構。 
因微鑽針加工十分精密，一但有不穩定現
象將導致加工不良、挫曲甚至鑽針斷裂。故本
計畫先以理論分析再配合實驗量測此微小鑽
針鑽切時挫曲問題與動態特性分析，來探討鑽
針問題與改良鑽切製程。本計劃擬 
第一年度計劃：以理論配合有限元素分
析，探討微細鑽針鑽切過程之動態
與切削特性與挫曲。也希望能加進
超音波振動鑽切之分析。 
第二年度計劃：擬配合理論分析，實驗
實際鑽切之進刀動態與切削特性與
挫曲分析。 
第三年度計劃：希望能設計一鑽針夾具
以能分析以壓電材料所激發振動，
探討此超音波振動式鑽切對鑽切動
態與切削特性與挫曲之影響。 
希望藉由理論、實驗與實際設計刀具夾具
以期能改善超微細鑽針鑽切的動態特性與挫
曲斷針等問題，以達到正確且精密的鑽切加

Abstract 
The ultrasonic vibration is employed to 
depress the drill fracture in high speed drilling 
process. The dynamic characteristics and 
buckling of a micro drill in drilling process is 
also investigated in this study. Due to the high 
speed and micro drilling, the dill fracture in the 
high-speed micro milling is much more 
significant than the traditional milling. To 
proceed farther into an analysis of drill fracture, 
the drilling dynamic characteristics and 
buckling is worthy to pay attention to study, and 
then the ultrasonic vibration is used to improve 
the dynamic and buckling performance in 
drilling process. By using pre-twisted beam in 
this model, the micro dill can be simulated. The 
Dynamic response of the traditional drilling has

confinement effect may accelerate the local defect and cause 
the structure to fail. The modal localization phenomenon in a 
weakly coupled periodic structure has been studied in [6-8]. A 
localization frequency may be introduced for the periodic 
structure with local structural or material irregularities. In this 
work, the probability for introducing mode localization in a 
heat exchanger is explored. The periodically assembled fluid 
containing tubes in a heat exchanger can be considered as a 
weakly coupled periodic system.  
Most studies on heat exchangers focused on the heat or 
flow therein [9, 10]. Some papers as [11-14] studied the 
dynamic behavior of such heat exchanger systems. However, 
no investigation on mode localization in a heat exchanger with 
cross-flow has been reported yet. As noted in papers [15-19], 
focusing only on the tube structure is insufficient in addressing 
the structural failure mode potential. The effects of cross-flow 
fluid and the localization effect introduced from local defects 
on the dynamics of heat exchanger tubes must also be 
examined. References [15-19] have addressed the fluid effects 
on the dynamic behaviors of heat exchanger tube systems. The 
fluid in and around tubes has been observed to significantly 
affect the dynamic characteristics of a heat exchanger tube 
system. Investigations such as Chen and Zhu etc. [20, 21] 
further studied the fluid stiffness and damping in fluid filled 
tubes.   
Even if the mode localization effect exhibits similar 
sensitivity to disorder the periodically assembled tube system, 
few investigators turn their attentions to this phenomenon 
caused by local defects in a tube bundle, especially in cross-
flow heat exchanger system. However, the localization mode 
may make the local structure defects aggravated gradually. 
Periodically coupled tubes system was used in this study to 
simulate a heat exchanger system, an impact wear defect is 
assumed at the middle of one tube. For simplicity, the tubes are 
approximated as Euler-Bernoulli beams with round and hollow 
cross sections. The fluid stiffness [20, 21] model is employed to 
couple the fluid filled tubes. The Galerkin’s method was used to 
derive the discrete modal localization equation for this 
mistuned periodic system.

EQUATIONS OF MOTION OF THE COUPLED TUBE 
ARRAY 
A heat exchanger tube structure with an average cross fluid 
flow U  is shown in Fig. 2. Each tube is coupled to adjacent 
tubes through the squeezed fluid film. The length of each tube 
between two support plates in the heat exchanger is L. In this 
system, the tubes are arranged in a 1.35 pitch-to-diameter ratio. 
The fluid coupling effect on the dynamics of the system is 
considered herein. The tube outer diameter and wall thickness 
are D and b, respectively. Figure 3(a) presents the boundary 
conditions for these tubes. The notations, ( ),jv r t  and 
( ),ju r t , denote the transverse flexible deflections of the jth tube 
in the horizontal and the perpendicular planes, respectively, as 
shown in Fig. 3(b). The jth tube is assumed to have a local 
defect, e.g. an impact wear, near the middle of the tube. In other 
words, the jth tube has a relative smaller stiffness in the 
transverse direction. 
In the following equations, jE  is Young's modulus and 
jI  is the moment of area for the j
th tube. For simplicity, the 
fluid introduced damping effect is ignored in this study. The 
equations of motion for these heat exchanger tubes are 
displayed as [21],

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A cross-flow type heat exchanger with 60 tubes attached in 
6 rows, as shown in Fig. 2, is studied in this work. The tubes are 
specified with following dimensions: L=381mm (15 inch), 
D=25.4mm (1 inch), and b=0.71mm (0.0279 inch), respectively. 
The tubes are arranged in a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1.35. The 
average flow velocity is U=0.05m/s. To explore the possibility 
to have a mode localization phenomenon in a periodically 
coupled tube array, the 35th tube in the tube array is assumed to 
be worn out near the middle. In other words, a local defect is 
assumed on the 35th tube and all the other tubes are considered 
perfect. As noted, the tube stiffness will be decreased if a local 
defect, e.g. impact wear, flaw, crack,…, etc., is existed. The tube 
local wear is regarded as a local structural irregularity in this 
example. In order to provide some insight into localization in a 
periodically arranged tube array with fluid coupling, the 
disorder in the jth tube is defined as 
( )
100%jj
EI EI
EI
ε −= × . 
where EI  is the stiffness of perfect tube and ( ) jEI  is the 
decreased stiffness of the defected jth tube.  
Figure 4 shows the variation of natural frequencies of the 
perfect tube array system with or without considering the 
squeezed liquid film effect between tubes. The results reveal 
that the repeated natural frequencies of a tube array are almost 
identical for the periodic system. However, with considering the 
fluid coupling effect, the natural frequencies are no longer 
equal. Due to the added mass effect introduced from the fluid, 
the natural frequencies of the tube system are decreased. The 
effect of cross-flow velocity on the natural frequencies is also 
considered in this figure. It is observed that the natural 
frequencies of system with flow fluid are lower than all other 
systems. Figure 5 presents the mode localization effect on the 
natural frequencies of the defected 35th tube with an average 
flow velocity of U=0.05 m/sec. The existence of local defect 
reduces the lowest natural frequency, i.e. the localization 
frequency. As mentioned in a number of studies [6, 7], 
corresponding to the localization frequency has a localization 
mode. In the localization mode, a serious vibration is found at 
the defected tube, i.e. the 35th tube, and the surround tubes. In 
other words, the vibration energy is confined just in these few 
tubes and the serious vibration on defected tube may accelerate 
the propagation of the local defect. For clarity, the amplitude 
distribution pattern is used frequently to explain the mode 
localization in a mistuned tube array with cross-flow. For 
simplicity, the maximum amplitude of the jth tube, i.e. 
( ) ( )2 2j ju v+  near the middle of tube, is used to describe the 
distribution pattern. Figure 6 shows the maximum amplitude 
pattern of tube array systems with a local defect on the 35th tube, 
%35 15ε = .. Modal localization in this defected tube array system 
is obvious. As mentioned previously, an amplitude peak is found 
on the 35th tube. The vibration energy is confined to the tubes 
near the defected 35th tube. Usually, this localized vibration 
pattern introduced from a local defect in a coupled periodic 
structure is called the localization mode. The simulated results 
show that the mode localization phenomenon is possible in a 
tube array with flow fluid. Consider a uniformly distributed 
harmonic force { } i tF e ω , applied to the tubes of the coupled 
tube array. The variation of frequency responses of the perfect 
and defected systems are shown in Fig. 7. Since the repeat 
lowest frequencies are identical, there is only a single peak at 
4 88.ω =  is observed for the tuned system. In the locally 
defected tube, however, the lower natural frequencies are no 
longer identical in this case. That is the reason why a number of 
peaks are found in Fig. 6. The lowest resonance frequency of 
this mistuned tube array system, i.e., the so-called localization 
frequency, is 1 4 4165.ω = , which is close but lower than the 
corresponding lowest natural frequency of a tuned system. 
The effect of fluid flow speed on localization mode pattern 
in a mistuned tube array system is shown in Fig. 8. The results 
indicate that the mode pattern may vary from a strong 
localization to a weak localization as the fluid flow speed is 
increased. In other words, the fluid flow velocity may depress 
the mode localization vibration in the tube array system. Figure 
9 plots the localization mode patterns for the mistuned tube 
systems with different tube thickness. The thicker tubes make 
the tube array system stiffer. However, the results show that the 
thicker tube may enhance the localization vibration. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
A localization vibration model for the tube array with a 
local defect is proposed in this work. Numerical simulation 
results show that the localization vibration is possible exist in a 
defected tube array system with considering the fluid flow 
coupling effect. The following major conclusions can be drawn 
in this study. 
(1) A disorder caused by local impact wear or flaw on the 
single tube may cause a vibration localization phenomenon in a 
periodically arrayed tube system with considering the fluid flow 
coupling effect. The modal localization will confine the 
vibration energy on tubes just around the defected tube. The 
numerical results also show that this localization effect may be 
enhanced as the magnitude of defect is increased.  
(2) The results indicate that the other parameters, e.g. the 
fluid flow speed and tube thickness, may have some influences 
on the localization mode. Generally, a higher flow speed may 
depress this localization vibration. 
(3) The local disorder in a periodic tube structure may 
change the frequency response of the defected tube. A group of 
peak amplitudes spread in a wider frequency range is found for 
the defected tube, which is different from the single peak for a 
regular tube.
