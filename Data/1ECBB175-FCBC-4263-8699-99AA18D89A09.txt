3.2 聯合補貨問題（Joint Replenishment 
Problem, JRP） 
Sunil 與 Peter (2007)兩位學者所著的
書中提到，在規劃和管理供應鏈的存貨，
可以採用週期存貨策略進行管理，文中提
到降低週期存貨的關鍵是降低批量大小，
在兩位學者所著的書中提出三種存貨訂購
模式：(1)獨立訂購；(2)同時訂購；(3)聯合
訂購，其目的在於將零售商是當的集合在
一起，消耗較快的零售商較常訂購，而消
耗較慢的零售商則較少訂購。

者對 PVRP 定義為：「於一段週期時間內，
在可用車輛數、車輛容量及可行服務日期

本研究以供應商代管存貨的觀點，由
單一供應商對多零售商的存貨進行規劃，
以整合多個零售商不同的需求。首先找出
一最常訂購之產品，而其餘的產品則配合
最常訂購之產品進行訂購週期的調整，最
後會形成一具週期性的補貨頻率，在此策
略下之存貨持有成本皆比獨立訂購和同時

售商聯合補貨情形下結合車輛途程問題為
本研究的主要議題。

ABSTRACT 
 
This study focuses on the spine layout in multiple floors by arranging workstations along 
several closed-loop moving tracks. The objective is to minimize the horizontal and vertical handling 
costs. The model and solution algorithm using Tabu search are also developed and they are also 
verified by a numerical example. 
 
Keywords: Multi-floor Layout, Tabu Search, Semiconductor Manufacturing Plant. 
 
1. Introduction 
There are two typical layout types i.e. spine layout and perimeter layout, used in the 
semiconductor industry [Peter and Yang, 1997]. In the spine layout, as indicated in Figure 1, 
workstations (bays) are arranged outside of a closed-loop moving track and each workstation is 
linked to the track by a P/D (pick-up and deposit) point. In the perimeter layout, as indicated in 
Figure 2, the moving track is built on the border of manufacturing area. Each workstation is also 
connected to the moving track by a P/D point. In this study, we focus on the problem of spine layout 
and expand the problem to the multi-floor environment. 
Since highly repetitive process happens in the semiconductor manufacturing plant, the layout 
problem becomes an important issue especially for operation efficiency. Material handling system 
in the spine layout is designed as a closed-loop moving track which links all workstations in the 
plant. The working parts can be moved between workstations along the fixed moving track by 
automated handling devices or overhead automated handling devices. To simplify the analysis 
process in this research, it is assumed that (1) the material handling system has a rectangular-shaped 
moving track on each floor and (2) all workstations on the same floor are arranged along this fixed 
moving track. 
The multi-floor manufacturing environment increases the complexity of plant layout problem, 
however, it can effectively reduce space requirement which is especially important for most of 
industries in Taiwan. The work-in-process (WIP) movements in multiple floors involve both the 
horizontal and the vertical transportations. In addition, the horizontal moves can be categorized as 
two types of movements: (1) the horizontal movements within the floor and (2) the horizontal 
movements between workstations and between workstation and elevator (i.e. the starting or ending 
points of each vertical movement).  
Since the multi-floor layout problem may generate a huge solution space, it is also recognized 
as the NP hard problem. A heuristic solution algorithm is suggested to solve these problems. Chiang, 
W.C. and Chiang, C [1998] compare the performance of simulated annealing algorithm 
[Kirkpatrick et. al., 1983] and Tabu search on the layout of quadratic assignment problem. Their 
results indicate that Tabu search is superior to simulated annealing algorithm, therefore, we will use 
the logic of Tabu search to design the solution algorithm in this research.

location of elevator has the same coordinates on each floor, as indicated in Figure 3 (b). 
(5) Each workstation has one and only one pick-up and deposit (P/D) point for part transportation. 
For each workstation, the P/D point is located at the center point of the occupied length on the 
moving track, as indicated in Figure 3 (b). 
(6) The number of workstation and number of floor required in the system are fixed and given. The 
flow quantity and safety distance between two workstations are also given and known.

2.2 The overall objective function and solution concept 
To arrange a better layout for the multi-floor environment, it is necessary to consider all 
possible transportation costs including the horizontal and vertical movements. For the layout 
problem in this study, three major decisions should be made: (1) assigning workstations to each 
floor, (2) the location of each workstation on each floor, and (3) the location of the elevator. 
In this research, the overall objective function is presented in equation (1). The first term of 
equation (1) represents the cost associated with vertical movement which is operated by the elevator. 
The cost of horizontal movement include two different types as follows: (1) the movement between 
workstations on the same floor which is represented in the second term of equation (1), (2) the 
movement to or from the elevator on the same floor, which is also recognized as the inter-floor 
movement. The cost of inter-floor movement is represented in the third term of equation (1).

To minimize the vertical transportation cost is the major concern in stage I. The objective 
function of this stage is presented in equation (2) which is the same as the first term in equation (1). 
The first constraint in equation (3) is to confirm the total length can not exceed the maximal length, 
i.e. l, allowed in each side of the moving track. Equation (4) makes sure that all workstations are 
included in the layout. Equation (5) ensures that each workstation should be assigned to one and 
only one floor. Finally, the decision variables are restricted to 0 or 1, as indicated in equation (6). 
2.4 Mathematical model of stage II 
Based on the workstation assignment on each floor, Stage II will further generate the optimal 
layout on each floor, which is executed by arranging workstations along the closed-loop moving 
track. In this study the workstation should be arranged on either the upper track or lower track. The 
layout of each floor can be solved independently since the workstations have been allocated on each 
floor in stage I.  
For accuracy description of location for each workstation, it is necessary to define a 
one-direction coordinates system on the closed-loop moving track. In this research, we use the 
upper right corner in the moving track as the original point in the coordinates system, as the blue 
dot indicated in Figure 3 (a). In addition, we use the counterclockwise direction to define the 
following location point. The location of a workstation (the P/D point of a workstation) is 
represented by the center point of the occupied length on the moving track, as the red dot shown on 
Figure 3 (a). The following additional notations should be defined before the model development. 
fiX  :  coordinates of workstation i (the P/D point) on the f th floor, 0 ≤ fiX ≤ L 
iUfX , : coordinates of workstation i (the P/D point) on the upper track of the f th floor,

3.1 Solution algorithm of stage I 
A stepwise solution algorithm for stage I is developed as follows. 
Step 1: Input Tabu parameters and basic data, such as length of Tabu list, stopping criterion, lengths 
of workstation, safety distances, vertical distance between floors, and cost data. 
Step 2: Generate a random initial solution (workstations assignment) starting from the first floor. 
Step 3: Calculate objective function value i.e. the vertical transportation cost, and set it to be the 
current best solution. 
Step 4: Set counter r = 0. 
Step 5: Set the probability for pair-wise interchange (P) and the probability for insertion (1-P). 
Step 6: Generate a random number (R). If R≤P, then go to step 7. Otherwise (i.e. R>P), go to step 
15. 
Step 7: Pick up two workstations from different floors randomly. 
Step 8: Check the feasibility of interchange. If it is acceptable, go to step 9. Otherwise, go to step 7 
until all possible interchanges have been checked.

4. Illustration Example 
4.1 Basic data of the example 
The complete example will be used to illustrate the solution algorithms of stage I and stage II. 
There are 33 workstations which will be arranged on three floors. Each floor has a 104-meter 
moving track (i.e. l=50, w=2, L=2l+2w=104) and the length between floors is 3 meters. The unit 
vertical transportation cost is $2 and the unit horizontal transportation cost is $1. The lengths of 
workstation, safety distances, and flow quantities between workstations are all fixed and known. 
The parameters of Tabu search are tested by using Taguchi experiment. The experiment results 
of stage I are summarized as follows: the stopping criterion is 450 iterations, length of Tabu list is 8, 
and the probabilities for pare-wise interchange and insertion are 65% and 35%, respectively. The 
experiment results of stage II are summarized as follows: the stopping criterion is 800 iterations, 
number of neighborhood solutions is 200, and the length of Tabu list is 7. In stage II, the probability 
of pair-wise workstation interchange are equal to the probability of single workstation shift, i.e. 0.5.     
Both solution algorithms are programmed by Visual C++ 2008 on the Windows Vista platform PC: 
Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo 1.50HGz, 2G RAM. 
4.2 Stage I - solution result and comparison 
The stage I of the illustration example has independently executed 5 times using the proposed 
algorithm. The objective function values (OFV) and computation times for all independent runs are 
presented in Table 1. By comparing the results in Table 1, the maximal deviation of OFV is less 
than o.4%, i.e. based on the averaged OFV=92021.6. The algorithm shows stable outcomes within a 
reasonable range of time. Table 2 shows the final workstation arrangement on each floor. 
One important feature of this solution algorithm is combination of the pair-wise interchange 
move (65%) and the insertion move (35%). It is interesting to further compare this approach with 
the traditional approach i.e. pure pair-wise interchange move. This experiments are conducted by 
repeating 5 independent runs using the same data. Comparison results are summarized in Table 3. It 
is obviously that the combination moves proposed in this research is a better than traditional

Abstract 
This research attempts to solve both the multi-trip vehicle routing problem and the distribution 
center location problem at the same time. A mathematic model is developed first. The objective of 
this model is to minimize the total costs including the transportation costs and the activated vehicle 
costs. A heuristic algorithm is then developed for solving the problem which consists of three 
phases. The first phase is to find an initial location and routings. The second phase applies exchange 
algorithms to obtain better routings by using Simulated Annealing (SA) logic. The final phase is to 
improve the location which is controlled by the current temperatures of SA method. The results of 
numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm can effectively acquire a better distribution 
center location and the associated routings. Finally, the numerical experiments indicate that: (1) 
Using larger capacity of vehicle is better for reducing transportation distance. (2) Increasing service 
time can effectively reduce the number of vehicle required. Both results are useful for management 
decision in the multi-trip vehicle routing problem and distribution center location problem as well. 
 
Keywords: Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem, Location Routing Problem, Heuristic Algorithm. 
 
I. Introduction 
The increasing energy price gives a great impact on transportation industries and public 
transportation systems. For most of the distribution centers, cost reduction becomes the top priority 
issue for survival in this harsh environment. One of the motivations of this research is trying to 
develop an effective routing approach for reducing the transportation cost. In addition, the location 
of distribution center is a critical and long-term decision for management level. A good location 
decision can reduce the distances between demand points and depot point. It is also believed that a 
reasonable location decision can be made by given a set demand points with fixed flow quantities 
and fixed destinations. Choosing a good location for distribution center is the second motivation of 
this research. A multi-trip vehicle routing policy can fully utilize all the working hours in a given 
period. It is also an efficient way to reduce the total number of vehicle to be activated, therefore, the 
fixed cost of vehicles can be saved. Figure 1 indicates a typical multi-trip routing for three vehicles. 
Based on the motivations mentioned above, this research provides an integrated approach to solve 
the multi-trip vehicle routing problem and location problem for distribution center simultaneously.  
 
II. Literatures Review 
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is extended from traveler salesman problem with loading 
capacity of vehicle. Due to the complexity nation of VRP, it is one of NP-hard problems when the 
problem scale increases. Bodin and Golden suggested seven solution policies as follows: (1) Cluster 
first – Route second, (2) Route first – Cluster second, (3) Saving or insertion, (4) Improvement or 
21 
(k) Quantity required by each customer in one per period is given and fixed. This quantity should 
be satisfied in each period. 
(l) In each time period (day), each demand point should be served once by one vehicle only. 
(m) Euclidean distance is considered between any two transporting points. 
 
3.2 The Mathematical Model  
Based on the assumptions described in section 3.1, a mathematical model is then developed 
which focuses on the location vehicle routing problem with multi-trip operational policy. All the 
parameters and variables in this model are defined as follows: 
 
N : total number of demand point (customer) 
i, j : index of demand point,   i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., N   
i = 0 or j = 0 represents the distribution center (depot point). 
k : index of vehicle,   k = 1, 2, 3, …, K   K is the total number of activated vehicle. 
r : index of trip,   r = 1, 2, 3, …, R   R is the total number of trip. 
qj : delivery quantity in one period for demand point j,    q0 = 0 
Q : maximal loading capacity of vehicle 
m : average speed of vehicle 
l : unit loading time in the distribution center 
u : unit unloading time in the demand point 
VC : vehicle activated cost per period (given) 
TC : vehicle transportation cost per unit distance 
dij : distance from demand point i to demand point j,   
 dij = [ ] 2/1 22 )()( jiji yyxx −+− ,  where (xf, yf) is the coordinates of demand point f.

  Otherwise, rijkX   = 0.

In stage II, three basic approaches for routing improvement are used: (1) 1-1 internal route 
exchange, (2) 1-1 external route exchange, and (3)1-0 external route insertion. Due to the multi-trip 
nature in this study, the insertions and exchanges should include different vehicles and different 
trips. The basic logic of simulated annealing will be applied in this stage.  
For the location improvement in stage III, the searching range of new location is based on the 
current temperature in the simulated annealing logic. Basically, we define a circle and the area 
within this circle is the “searching range”. When the temperature reduces and the radium of the 
searching circle will shorten. In another word, the searching area will gradually reduce through the 
entire searching process. 
 
IV. Illustration Examples and Sensitivity Analysis 
In this section, two typical examples are solved by the algorithm developed in section 3.3. The 
demand points of the first example are uniformly spread in the distribution area, whereas the second 
example features one community which the demand points concentrate within a specific area. The 
basic data of examples and solution results are described in section 4.1. The second part of this 
section performs a sensitivity analysis which includes single/multi-trip, different loading capacities 
of vehicle, and different service times. Section 4.2 discusses results of this sensitivity analysis.

4.2 Sensitivity Analysis 
The following analysis focuses on three topics: single trip and multi-trip, different vehicle 
loading capacities, and different service time in one period.  
Table 3 summarizes the comparison results for single-trip and multi-trip vehicle routing 
problem. In Table 3, the data of single-trip is directly quoted from the international example 
E-n51-k5 and the data of multi-trip is averaged from 10 independent runs using the solution 
algorithm developed in this research. Several observations can be found as follows: (a) The single- 
trip policy can shorten the finishing time, however, it requires more vehicles. (b) The multi-trip 
policy can effectively utilize service time in one period, i.e. 480 minutes in this case. (c) The 
multi-trip policy can save the vehicle activated cost, but it suffers from longer transportation cost 
(longer travel distance). In summary, the decision making depends on activated cost per vehicle and 
transportation cost per unit distance.

V. Conclusion 
This paper investigates the location vehicle routing problem under the multi-trip operational 
policy. A mathematical model and the associated solution algorithm are also proposed to solve this 
problem. The proposed heuristic solution algorithm is based on the simulated annealing logic, 
which is also confirmed to be an effective approach by several illustration examples. A sensitivity 
analysis is also conducted and the results are useful for management decisions.
