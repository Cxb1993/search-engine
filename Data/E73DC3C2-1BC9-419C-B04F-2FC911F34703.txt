英文摘要 
 
     Pure exo-functional norbornene monomers containing various chromophores such 
as fluorene, pyrene, and carbazole were successfully prepared via the Diels–Alder 
reaction and condensation reaction. The living ring-opening metathesis polymerization 
(ROMP) of a fluorene-containing monomer, exo-2-(fluorene-9-ylcarboxymethyl) 
norborn-5-ene (exo-1), was observed and confirmed by the formation of a diblock 
copolymer and a linear relationship between the number-average molecular weight and 
[M]/[I] ratios ([M] = monomer concentration; [I] = initiator concentration). The 
synthesis and characteristics of novel fluorene-containing polymers based on pure exo-1 
are reported with Grubbs catalyst I {RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2} with a high molecular 
weight of 3.18 × 104 in 90 s ([M]/[I] = 100). However, the ROMP of pyrene- and 
carbazole- containing monomers [exo-5-(pyrene methoxy 
carbonyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene and exo-5-(carbazole ethoxy 
carbonyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, respectively] were carried out in a nonliving fashion. 
All the chromophore-containing polymers showed excellent solubility in various 
organic solvents, particularly in chloroform, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, and 
1,2-dichlorobenzene. The glass transition temperatures of polynorbornenes containing 
various chromophores were determined to be 80 – 109 oC (by differential scanning 
calorimetry) higher than that of ring-opened polynorbornene (glass transition 
temperature = 35 oC), indicating that the incorporation of the pendant aromatic moieties 
(e.g., fluorene, pyrene, and carbazole) could enhance the transition temperature for 
segmental motions of polymer chains. The photoluminescence spectra of all polymer 
solutions showed a strong emission in the blue region of the visible spectra.

Monomer Synthesis 
Synthesis of exo-1 
A mixture of 9H-fluorene-9-carboxylic acid (7.74 g, 0.0368 mol) and 
exo-5-(hydroxyl methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (5.48 g, 0.044 mol)23 in toluene was 
charged into a flask [250 mL; Scheme 1(a)]. The p-toluenesulfonic acid was added as a 
catalyst. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 140 oC for 5 h, and water was removed as 
an azeotropic mixture via refluxing with toluene. After the completion of the reaction, 
the solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator. The reaction mixture was purified by 
column chromatography (ethyl acetate/n-hexane = 1:3) and then recrystallized from 
cold n-hexane, giving a white solid (mp = 44–45 oC). IR (KBr pellet, cm-1): 1587 (νc=c, 
vinylic), 1647, 1478 (νc=c, aromatic stretching). The 1H NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of 
exo-1 exhibited signals at δ = 1.18–1.21 (H6, 2H), 1.27–1.37 (H7, 2H), 1.77–1.81 (H5, 
1H), 2.68 (H4, 1H), 2.86 (H1, 1H), 4.09–4.28 (H8, 2H), 4.92 (H10, 1H), 6.11 (H2 and H3, 
2H), and 7.37–7.80 ppm (H11, 8H) [Fig. 1(a)]. The 13C NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of exo-1 
exhibited signals at δ = 29.49 (C6), 37.95 (C5), 41.52 (C1), 43.58 (C4), 44.92 (C7), 53.47 
(C10), 69.34 (C8), 136.21 (C3), 137.99 (C2), 119.94, 125.53, 127.21, 127.99, 140.67, 
141.36 (C11), and 170.75 ppm (C9). 
 
Synthesis of exo-2 
A mixture of 1-pyrene methanol (3 g, 0.013 mol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF; 50 
mL) and triethylamine (1.58 g, 0.015 mol) was added to a flask (250 mL). The 
exo-5-(carbonyl chloride)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (2.03 g, 0.013 mol) was dissolved in 
dry THF (10 mL) and then added dropwise at the ambient temperature to the above 
reaction mixture, which was stirred continuously for 4 h. After the completion of the 
reaction, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by 
silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/n-hexane = 1:3). Then, the product was 
recrystallized from n-hexane, and a white solid was obtained (mp = 75 – 77 oC). The 1H 
NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of exo-2 exhibited signals at δ = 1.41 and 2.08 (H6, 2H), 1.44 
and 1.67 (H7, 2H), 2.38 (H5, 1H), 2.97 (H1, 1H), 3.17 (H4, 1H), 5.86 (H9, 2H), 6.11 (H2, 
1H), 6.16 (H3, 1H), and 7.37–7.80 ppm (H10, 9H). The 13C NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of 
exo-2 exhibited signals at δ = 30.33 (C6), 41.57 (C1), 43.19 (C5), 46.33 122.82, 124.51, 
124.56, 124.78, 125.31, 125.38, 125.95, 127.26, 127.56, 127.65, 128.01, 129.08, 130.61, 
131.11, 131.57 ppm (C8) [Fig. 2(a,b)].

Polymerization of exo-2 
Poly(exo-2) was prepared by the adoption of a procedure similar to the synthesis of 
poly(exo-1), with [M]/[I] = [exo-2]/[RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2] = 1000 ([M] = 
monomer concentration; [I] = initiator concentration), via polymerization in chloroform 
at 35 oC for 1 h with a yield of 73%. The polymer was insoluble in THF. The 1H NMR 
(CDCl3) spectrum of poly(exo-2) exhibited signals at δ = 0.40–2.91 (H1, H4, H5, H6, H7), 
4.50–5.18 (H9), 5.64–5.66 (H2, H3), and 7.84–8.29 ppm (H10). The 13C NMR (CDCl3) 
spectrum of poly (exo-2) exhibited signals at δ = 41.82–50.34 (C1, C4, C5, C6, C7), 64.53 
(C9), 131.37–132.79 (C3, C2), 122.83–138.05 (C10), and 176.20 ppm (C8). 
 
Polymerization of exo-3 
Poly(exo-3) was prepared by the adoption of a procedure similar to the synthesis 
of poly(exo-1), with [M]/[I] = [exo-3]/[RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2] = 1000, via 
polymerization at 35 oC for 1 h. A number-average molecular weight of 6.15 × 104 (the 
theoretical value was 3.31 × 105) and polydispersity index (PDI) values close to 1.60 
were observed, with a yield of 14%. The 1H NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of poly(exo-3) 
exhibited signals at δ = 0.50–2.70 (H1, H4, H5, H6, H7), 4.20–4.80 (H9, H10), 4.90–5.30 
(H2, H3), and 7.84–8.29 ppm (H11). The 13C NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of poly (exo-3) 
exhibited signals at δ = 35.01–51.48 (C1, C4, C5, C6, C7, C10), 63.53 (C9), 131.37–132.79 
(C3, C2), 122.83–138.05 (C11), and 176.20 ppm (C8).

polymerization could be carried out in a short time. A linear relationship of the 
number-average molecular weight of poly(exo-1) increasing with the [M]/[I] ratio, a 
narrow polydispersity between 1.05 and 1.10, and a yield above 99% for all ratios 
([M]/[I] < 250) were observed [Figs. 3(b,c) and 4(a)], and this was an indication of a 
living polymerization. Moreover, the linear relationship of the number-average 
molecular weight of poly (exo-1) and the polymerization time is shown in Figure 4(b). 
The conversion was over 95% after 90 s [Fig. 5(a)]. The semilogarithmic plot of the 
monomer conversion versus the time was linear for the ROMP of exo-1 [Fig. 5(b)]. One 
equivalent of the Ru catalyst {Cl2Ru(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2} and 35 equiv of exo-1 were 
polymerized for 90 s at 35 oC in THF. One portion of the polymerization solution 
exhibited a number-average molecular weight of 1.14 × 104, which was close to the 
calculated molecular weight of 1.10 × 104 {[M]/[I] = 35; Fig. 3(d)}. Another portion of 
35 equiv of exo-1 was added and stirred for an additional 90 s before termination. The 
number-average molecular weight of 2.55 × 104 (the theoretical value was 2.21 × 104) 
and PDI values around 1.10 were observed [Fig. 3(e)]. A clear increase in the molecular 
weight was accomplished, indicating that no chain termination processes had occurred, 
and the living ROMP of exo-1 was confirmed [Fig. 3(b,c)]. In the NMR measurement of 
the solution of exo-1 and the Ru catalyst, the signals of olefinic protons at δ = 5.5–6.0 
ppm (norbornene group of monomer exo-1) were shifted to 5.1–5.2 ppm 
(polynorbornene main chain, trans/cis ratio = 85/15), completely indicating that exo-1 
was consumed within a short time of 90 s, which is another piece of evidence 
supporting living polymerization. The living ROMP of exo-1 was confirmed. In 
addition, the GPC trace of poly(exo-1) after a long polymerization time (e.g., >2 h) was 
observed, with a small shoulder appearing on the high-molecular weight side of the 
GPC curves, which might be due to traces of oxygen in the system. ROMP of several 
exo-norbornene derivatives has recently been carried out using Grubbs catalyst I in a 
living fashion.24,25 Although such exo-norbornene derivatives react more quickly to give 
a quantitative yield of the polymer than endo-rich or endoisomers, they need to spend 
more than 25 min and even 5 h for living ROMP using Grubbs catalyst I. 25-28 As the 
ROMP of exo-1 with [M]/[I] = 125 was carried out at 35 oC in THF with the 
RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2 catalyst, the number average molecular weight (3.90×104; 
PDI = 1.06) of poly(exo-1) was close to the calculated molecular weight (3.96 × 104) 
after 90 s [Fig. 3(f)], and a diblock copolymer [poly(exo-1)-b-(NBCbz)] (Scheme 2) 
with an increase in the number-average molecular weight of 5.21 × 104 (PDI = 1.21) 
 14
which is higher than that of the commercially available ring-opened polynorbornene (35 
oC), indicating that the incorporation of the pendant aromatic moieties (e.g., fluorene, 
pyrene, and carbazole) could enhance the transition temperature for segmental motions 
of polymer chains. The polymers exhibited glass transitions at 80, 109, and 91 oC for 
poly(exo-1), poly(exo-2), and poly(exo-3), respectively. 
 
Optical Properties of Polynorbornenes Containing Various Chromophores 
The photoluminescence spectra of poly(exo-1), poly(exo-2), and poly(exo-3) are 
shown in Figure 6. The photoluminescence emission of poly(exo-1) with two peaks at 
360 and 375 nm and a significant shoulder extending from 391 to 500 nm were 
observed in a CHCl3 solution [Fig. 6(a)]. In the photoluminescence spectrum of 
poly(exo-1) film, the maxima and shoulder shifted to 375 and 395 nm, respectively, 
implying some aggregations of the poly(exo-1) film [Fig. 6(b)]. The photoluminescence 
spectra of the poly(exo-1) solution and poly (exo-1) film showed strong emissions in the 
blue region of the visible spectra. From photoluminescence spectra of poly(exo-2), 
poly(exo-2) in a CHCl3 solution exhibited a monomer emission at 378 and 394 nm and a 
strong excimer emission near 476 nm [Fig. 6(c)]. The poly(exo-2) film exhibited only 
an excimer emission near 480 nm, implying aggregations of the poly(exo-2) film [Fig. 
6(d)].34,35 From photoluminescence spectra of poly(exo-3), poly(exo-3) in a CHCl3 
solution exhibited an emission at kmax values of 347 and 363 nm [Fig. 6(e)]. The 
poly(exo-3) film exhibited a strong fluorescence monomer emission of the carbazole 
group occurring in near-UV at 377 nm and a significant excimer emission extending 
from 390 to 500 nm, which exhibited a blue-green color [Fig. 6(f)]. The 
photoluminescence spectra of all the polymer solutions showed a strong emission in the 
blue region of the visible spectra.

Measurements. FTIR spectra were recorded in the range 4000-
400 cm-1 for the synthesized monomers and polymers in an KBr
disk (Bio-Rad Digilab FTS-3500). Elemental analysis was made
on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 instrument. The inherent viscosity of
polyimide was measured using Ubbelohde viscometer. NMR spectra
were recorded using a Bruker Avance 500 NMR (1H at 500.13
MHz and 13C at 125.77 MHz). Weight-average (Mw) and number-
average molecular weights (Mn) were determined by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC). Calibration was made by using polystyrene
as standard with molecular weight in the range of 1680-402100
g/mol. Four Waters (UltraStyragel) columns (300  7.7 mm, guard,
105, 104, 103, and 500 Å in a series) were used for GPC analysis
with tetrahydrofuran (THF; 1 mL min-1) as the eluent. The eluents
were monitored with a UV detector (JMST Systems, VUV-24,
USA) at 254 nm. Thermogravimetric data were obtained on a TA
Instruments Dynamic TGA 2950 under nitrogen and air flowing
condition at a rate of 50 cm3 min-1 and a heating rate of 10 °C
min-1. Melting points of monomers and glass transition temperature
of polymer were performed on a differential scanning calorimeter
(TA Instruments TA 910) under nitrogen flowing conditions at a
rate of 50 cm3 min-1 and a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. Dielectric
constants of polyimide thin film were measured by the parallel-
plate capacitor method using a dielectric analyzer (TA Instrumenents
DEA 2970) at the range of frequency 1-10 kHz. Gold electrodes
were vacuum-deposited on both surfaces of dried film, and
measurement were made at 25 °Cunder N2 atmosphere. Average
tensile properties were determined at room temperature with five
specimens from the stress-strain curve obtained with an Orientec
Tensilon with a load cell of 10 kg. A gauge of 2 cm was used for
this study in a strain rate of 2 cm min-1. UV-vis spectra of the
polymer film were recorded on a V-550 spectrophotometer at room
temperature. The fluorescence spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu
RF-5031 spectrophotometer. Electron micrographs were recorded
with a JEOL JSM-6500 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at
20 kV.

and MSA (methanesulfonic acid), respectively, as a function
of acid concentration. In Figure 3, it is obvious that at low
protonated concentrations the absorption bands are the same as
neutral poly(pyridine-imide). When the acid concentration was
increased, a new band appeared at 430 nm. This phenomenon
was similar to the poly(2,5-pyridylene) (PPY), which has been
reported in the literature.29, 41,42 On protonated by HCl or MSA,
the absorption intensity at 283 nm (n-ð*) decreased depending
on concentration of protic acid, because of the lone pair electron
of the nitrogen on pyridine was quaternated by protic acid. The
presence of an isosbestic point in the UV-vis spectra at low
degree of protonation indicates the coexistence of protonated
and neutral segments in the poly(pyridine-imide). At high
degree of protonation, the isosbestic point is lost due to repulsion
between the charged pyridinium fragments. As shown in Figure
2, no abosorption band at 430 nm appears in solution as well
as in solid state. Therefore, the new band at 430 nm could be
a characteristic absorption band of the protonated polymer. The
spectral behavior suggest a lower ð-ð* transition energy for
the protonated polymer. When the protonation was carried out
with MSA, a similar trend was also observed (Figure 4).
Comparing Figure 3 with Figure 4, the poly(pyridine-imide)
protonated with MSA exhibited a higher absorption intensity
at 430 nm. The differences depend on the strength of protic
acid used.
The transparency of the poly(pyridine-imide) film (87 ím)
could also be elucidated from the cutoff wavelength observed
in the UV-visible transparent spectra. As shown in Figure 5,

equilibrium excited state.44 As observed in fluorescence spectra,
both protonated and unprotonated forms were present, and it
can be interpreted as evidence of incomplete ionization equi-
librium being established during the lifetime of the excited state.
In addition, two redox pairs were observed in cyclic voltam-
mogram of the polymer where the reduction values are at -0.63
and -1.08 V and the oxidation values are at -0.2 and -0.85
V (see Supporting Information).
The electrical insulating properties, measured on the parallel-
plate capacitor method using a dielectric analyzer on a thin film.
The poly(pyridine-imide) exhibited relatively high dielectric
constant of 4.53-4.26 in the frequency region of 1 to 10 kHz.
The dielectric constant of poly(pyridine-imide) at 1 kHz (4.32,
87 ím) is higher than that of commercially available polyimide
film, Kapton HN (3.50, 125 ím, 1 kHz). This poly(pyridine-
imide) also has a higher dielectric constant than the polyimides
(3.05, 87 ím, 1 kHz;37 3.58, 74 ím, 1 kHz)38 derived from
6FDA. The result of higher dielectric constant is due to the
presence of aryl-substituted pyridine heterocylic group and
ð-conjugation of pyrene structure in the polymer backbone,
which increased the polarizability of the polymer under electric
field.
The morphology of the poly(pyridine-imide) was observed
by scanning electron micrographs (SEM). Thin films were
obtained by depositing a drop of the polymer solutions onto a
glass slide. The SEM micrograph of poly(pyridine-imide) from
THF reveal that the surface of polymer is homogeneous with
irregular shaped granules that are neatly packed close to each
other (Figure 7a). For comparison with the protonated polymer,
we also prepared SEM sample by the same way from a THF/
HCl (1.0 M) solution of the poly(pyridine-imide), as shown
in Figure 7b, which clearly exhibited a large size of granules.
This may be attributable to the interaction of poly(pyridine-
imide) and HCl which resulted in aggregation of the polymer.
Conclusion
In the present study, a novel poly(pyridine-imide) containing
a heterocyclic pyridine and a pyrene substituent derived from
new diamine 4-(1-pyrene)-2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl) pyridine (2)
was successfully prepared. The obtained poly(pyridine-imide)
exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as
THF, DMAc, DMF, NMP, etc. The poly(pyridine-imide)
possessed a high dielectric constant and showed good ther-
mooxidative stability higher than 500 °C and excellent me-
chanical properties. This investigation showed that the polymer
possessed blue emission in neutral solution and orange emission
after protonation. After protonation with protic acid, the poly-
(pyridine-imide) exhibited a bathochromic shift. These char-
acteristics indicate that pyrene-containing poly(pyridine-imide)
is a promising material for optoelectric applications.

ABSTRACT: Pure exo-functional norbornene monomers containing various chromo-
phores such as ﬂuorene, pyrene, and carbazole were successfully prepared via the
Diels–Alder reaction and condensation reaction. The living ring-opening metathesis poly-
merization (ROMP) of a ﬂuorene-containing monomer, exo-2-(ﬂuorene-9-ylcarboxyme-
thyl)norborn-5-ene (exo-1), was observed and conﬁrmed by the formation of a diblock co-
polymer and a linear relationship between the number-average molecular weight and
[M]/[I] ratios ([M] ¼ monomer concentration; [I] ¼ initiator concentration). The synthe-
sis and characteristics of novel ﬂuorene-containing polymers based on pure exo-1 are
reported with Grubbs catalyst I {RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2} with a high molecular
weight of 3.18 3 104 in 90 s ([M]/[I] ¼ 100). However, the ROMP of pyrene- and carba-
zole-containing monomers [exo-5-(pyrene methoxy carbonyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene
and exo-5-(carbazole ethoxy carbonyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, respectively] were car-
ried out in a nonliving fashion. All the chromophore-containing polymers showed excel-
lent solubility in various organic solvents, particularly in chloroform,N-methyl-2-pyrro-
lidinone, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The glass transition temperatures of polynorbor-
nenes containing various chromophores were determined to be 80–109 8C (by
differential scanning calorimetry) higher than that of ring-opened polynorbornene
(glass transition temperature ¼ 35 8C), indicating that the incorporation of the pendant
aromatic moieties (e.g., ﬂuorene, pyrene, and carbazole) could enhance the transition
temperature for segmental motions of polymer chains. The photoluminescence spectra
of all polymer solutions showed a strong emission in the blue region of the visible spec-
tra. VC 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part A: Polym Chem 45: 3022–3031, 2007

Characterization Methods
The glass transition temperature was measured
with a DuPont 9000 differential scanning calo-
rimeter at a heating rate of 10 8Cmin1 in a nitro-
gen atmosphere. The weight-average molecular
weight and number-average molecular weight
were determined by gel permeation chromatogra-
phy (GPC) at 40 8C. Polystyrene was used as the
standard. Four Waters (Ultrastyragel) columns
(300 3 7.8 mm; 500, 103, 104, and 105 A˚ in a se-
ries) were used for GPC analysis with THF (1 mL
min1) as the eluent. The eluents were monitored
with a UV detector (Gilson model 116) at 254 nm.
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Avance 500 NMR operating at 500.13
MHz for proton and 125.75 MHz for carbon, and
tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as the stand-
ard. The photoluminescent spectra were recorded
by a Shimadzu RF-5031 spectrophotometer.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A series of functional monomers, exo-1, exo-2, and
exo-3, were synthesized and isolated (Scheme 1).
The structures of these monomers (exo-1, exo-2,
and exo-3) were conﬁrmed by 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopy. 13C NMR was used to differentiate
varieties of aliphatic carbons by use of the distor-
tionless enhancement by polarization transfer
(DEPT) technique because of some overlapped
peaks. Figure 2 shows the 13C NMR/DEPT spec-
tra of exo-2 and exo-3. For instance, the DEPT
spectrum of exo-2 [Fig. 2(a,b)] shows three upward
resonances at 41.57, 43.19, and 46.58 ppm in the
region of 30–70 ppm, which can be assigned to
the methine carbons (CH; C1, C5, and C4, respec-
tively), and three downward signals at 30.33,
46.33, and 64.63 ppm can be attributed to the
three methylene (CH2) carbons (C6, C7, and C9,
respectively) of the aliphatic part of exo-2 in
the region of 30–70 ppm. The DEPT spectrum of
exo-2 [Fig. 2(a,b)] shows no peaks at 124.45,
124.65, 128.98, 129.24, 130.50, 131.01, and
131.45 ppm, which can be assigned to the aro-
matic carbons without attached protons (CH0)
and observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of exo-2
[Fig. 2(b)]. There are nine upward resonances at
122.69, 124.41, 125.21, 125.27, 125.84, 127.15,
127.41, 127.53, and 127.89 ppm, which can be
assigned to the methine carbons (CH; C10) of the
pyrene group. Furthermore, the 13C NMR/DEPT
spectrum of exo-3 [Fig. 2(c,d)] shows three up-
ward resonances at 41.44, 42.86, and 46.26 ppm
in the region of 30–70 ppm, which can be assigned
to the methine carbons (CH; C1, C5, and C4,
respectively), and four downward signals at
30.11, 41.50, 46.19, and 61.98 ppm can be attrib-
uted to the four methylene (CH2) carbons (C6,

of exo-3 in the region of 30–70 ppm. The DEPT
spectrum of exo-3 [Fig. 2(c,d)] shows no peaks at

One equivalent of the Ru catalyst {Cl2Ru
(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2} and 35 equiv of exo-1 were
polymerized for 90 s at 35 8C in THF. One portion
of the polymerization solution exhibited a num-
ber-average molecular weight of 1.14 3 104,
which was close to the calculated molecular
weight of 1.10 3 104 {[M]/[I] ¼ 35; Fig. 3(d)}.
Another portion of 35 equiv of exo-1 was added
and stirred for an additional 90 s before termina-
tion. The number-average molecular weight of
2.55 3 104 (the theoretical value was 2.21 3 104)
and PDI values around 1.10 were observed
[Fig. 3(e)]. A clear increase in the molecular weight
was accomplished, indicating that no chain termi-
nation processes had occurred, and the living
ROMP of exo-1 was conﬁrmed [Fig. 3(b,c)]. In the
NMR measurement of the solution of exo-1 and
the Ru catalyst, the signals of oleﬁnic protons at d
¼ 5.5–6.0 ppm (norbornene group of monomer
exo-1) were shifted to 5.1–5.2 ppm (polynorbor-
nene main chain, trans/cis ratio ¼ 85/15), com-
pletely indicating that exo-1 was consumed
within a short time of 90 s, which is another piece
of evidence supporting living polymerization. The
living ROMP of exo-1 was conﬁrmed. In addition,
the GPC trace of poly(exo-1) after a long polymer-
ization time (e.g., >2 h) was observed, with a
small shoulder appearing on the high-molecular-
weight side of the GPC curves, which might be
due to traces of oxygen in the system. ROMP of
several exo-norbornene derivatives has recently
been carried out using Grubbs catalyst I in a liv-
ing fashion.18,22 Although such exo-norbornene
derivatives react more quickly to give a quantita-
tive yield of the polymer than endo-rich or endo-
isomers, they need to spend more than 25 min
and even 5 h for living ROMP using Grubbs cata-
lyst I.17,22,26,32 As the ROMP of exo-1 with [M]/[I]
¼ 125 was carried out at 35 8C in THF with the
RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2 catalyst, the number-
average molecular weight (3.90 3 104; PDI
¼ 1.06) of poly(exo-1) was close to the calculated mo-
lecular weight (3.96 3 104) after 90 s [Fig. 3(f)],
and a diblock copolymer [poly(exo-1)-b-(NBCbz)]
(Scheme 2) with an increase in the number-aver-
age molecular weight of 5.21 3 104 (PDI ¼ 1.21)
after the addition of another monomer, NBCbz
([M]/[I] ¼ 50), for another 2 h was observed, which
is close to the calculated molecular weight [5.23 3
104; Fig. 3(g)].26 The NMR spectra of poly(exo-1)
[Fig. 1(b)] showed the aromatic proton at d
¼ 7.26–7.73 ppm (HaHd; 1H NMR) and the aro-
matic carbon at d ¼ 118.63, 125.60, 127.28, 128.31
(CaCd), 140.38, and 140.37 ppm (Ce, Cf; 13C
NMR), which are due to aromatic ﬂuorene groups
within poly(exo-1) chains. After copolymerization,
the NMR spectra of diblock copolymer poly(exo-
1)-b-(NBCbz) showed a new signal at d ¼ 8.11
ppm and signals at d ¼ 7.26–7.73 ppm (1H NMR)
and the aromatic carbon at d ¼ 109.79, 118.54,
120.28, 125.43 (Ca0Cd0), 122.81, and 138.49 ppm
(Ce0, Cf0), which are due to the aromatic carbazole

Optical Properties of Polynorbornenes Containing
Various Chromophores
The photoluminescence spectra of poly(exo-1),
poly(exo-2), and poly(exo-3) are shown in Figure
6. The photoluminescence emission of poly(exo-1)
with two peaks at 360 and 375 nm and a signiﬁ-
cant shoulder extending from 391 to 500 nm were
observed in a CHCl3 solution [Fig. 6(a)]. In the
photoluminescence spectrum of poly(exo-1) ﬁlm,
themaxima and shoulder shifted to 375 and 395 nm,
respectively, implying some aggregations of the
poly(exo-1) ﬁlm [Fig. 6(b)]. The photolumines-
cence spectra of the poly(exo-1) solution and poly
(exo-1) ﬁlm showed strong emissions in the blue
region of the visible spectra. From photolumi-
nescence spectra of poly(exo-2), poly(exo-2) in a
CHCl3 solution exhibited a monomer emission at
378 and 394 nm and a strong excimer emission
near 476 nm [Fig. 6(c)]. The poly(exo-2) ﬁlm
exhibited only an excimer emission near 480 nm,
implying aggregations of the poly(exo-2) ﬁlm
[Fig. 6(d)].38,39 From photoluminescence spectra
of poly(exo-3), poly(exo-3) in a CHCl3 solution ex-
hibited an emission at kmax values of 347 and 363
nm [Fig. 6(e)]. The poly(exo-3) ﬁlm exhibited a
strong ﬂuorescence monomer emission of the car-
bazole group occurring in near-UV at 377 nm and
a signiﬁcant excimer emission extending from
390 to 500 nm, which exhibited a blue-green color
[Fig. 6(f)]. The photoluminescence spectra of all
the polymer solutions showed a strong emission
in the blue region of the visible spectra.
CONCLUSIONS
The synthesis and characteristics of novel poly-
mers based on pure exo-isomers with ROMP have
been reported. The monomer of exo-5-(ﬂuorene
carboxyl methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene under
ROMP conditions, with the concentration ratio of
the monomer to the initiator being 100, yielded
polymers with a high molecular weight of 3.18 3
104 in a reaction time of 90 s. The living ROMP of
exo-2-(ﬂuorene-9-ylcarboxymethyl)norborn-5-ene
was conﬁrmed by the formation of a diblock copol-
ymer and the linear relationship of the number-
average molecular weight increasing with the
[M]/[I] ratio. However, the ROMP of pyrene- and
carbazole-containing monomers was carried out
in a nonliving fashion. The polymers showed
excellent solubility in most of the organic sol-
vents.

ABSTRACT: A new diamine containing a pyridine heterocyclic group and a pyrene substituent, 4-(1-pyrene)-
2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyridine (PBAPP), was synthesized and used in a preparation of poly(pyridine-imide)
by direct polycondensation with 4,4′-hexafluoroisopropylidenediphathalic anhydride (6FDA) in N-methyl-2-
pyrrolidinone (NMP). The poly(pyridine-imide) derived from diamine (PBAPP) was highly soluble in several
solvents such as THF, NMP, DMAc, DMF, pyridine, DMSO, and cyclohexanone at room temperature or upon
heating at 70 °C and exhibited good thermal stability both in nitrogen and air (Td10>520 °C) and a high dielectric
constant of 4.32 at 1 kHz. The poly(pyridine-imide) could be cast into a flexible and tough film from DMAc
solution. The poly(pyridine-imide) film had a tensile strength of 118 MPa and a tensile modulus of 2.2 GPa.
The optical properties exhibited the UV-vis absorption bands at the region of 200-400 nm and possessed strong
orange fluorescent (560 nm) after protonated with protic acid.
Introduction
Polyimides constantly attract wider interest because of their
unique mechanical properties, thermal stability, and morphologi-
cal properties.1-7 Conventional polyimides like Kapton produced
by DuPont have been applied to microelectronic devices and
aerospace fields. However, these polyimides are generally
insoluble in organic solvent, exhibit low optical transparency,
and have an intense yellow color. Soluble polyimides are needed
as coating materials on specific space components. In order to
overcome this drawback, either bulky lateral substituents,
flexible alkyl side chains, unsymmetric, alicyclic or kinked
structure have been attached along the backbone.8-14 The rigid-
rod polyimides with high organic solubility have attracted some
research efforts in recent years. These efforts have been focused
on designing and synthesizing new rigid diamines that resulted
in soluble and processable polyimides without deterioration of
their positive properties.
In particular, polymers have attracted considerable attention
because of their good scalability, mechanical strength, flexibility,
and most important of all, ease of processing. In the recent years,
there has been a considerable interest in the photoluminescent
and electroluminescent properties of conjugated polymers.15-17
These polymer materials are used for several electronic ap-
plications, including light-emitting devices (LEDs), transistors,
photovoltaic cells, polymer memory, and switches.16,18-24
However, certain non-conjugated polymers, e.g., polyimides,
in combination with electron transporting layers, also rank
among efficient electroluminophores.22-24 Recently, some re-
ports have concerned the incorporation of pyridine and its
derivatives into polymeric frameworks.25 Compared to a benzene
ring, pyridine is an electron-deficient aromatic heterocycle, with
a localized lone pair of electrons in sp2 orbital on the nitrogen
atom; consequently, the derived polymers have increased
electron affinity,26 improved electron-transporting properties,27
and offer the possibility of protonation or alkylation of the lone
pair electrons as a way of modifying their properties.28,29 On
the other hand, the pyrene unit is an efficient fluorescent probe
because it has a long singlet lifetime and readily forms
excimer.30 A literature survey revealed that there are a limited
number of investigations concerning the attachment of pyrene
to polyimides.31,32 Pyrene containing polymers have been used
as acceptors for energy transfer from various donors.33,34
Additionally, the bulky condensed aromatic ring of pyrene is
expected to enhance the solubility and thermal stability of
polyimides.
The present investigation deals with the synthesis and
characterization of a new poly(pyridine-imide) derived from
a new monomer, 4-(1-pyrene)-2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyridine
(PBAPP), containing heterocyclic pyridine and pyrene substit-
uents. The solubility, electrochemical stability, mechanical,
thermal and optical properties of the obtained poly(pyridine-
imide) were investigated.
Experimental
Materials. The materials, 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde, 4′-nitroac-
etophenone, ammonium acetate, hydrazine monohydrate, and 10%
palladium on activated carbon were purchased from Merck and used
as received. Glacial acetic acid was purchased from Aldrich
Chemical Co. and used as received. 4,4′-Hexafluoroisopropylidene-
diphathalic anhydride (6FDA, TCI) was recrystallized twice from
acetic anhydride, and then sublimated before use. The solvents,
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N′-
dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were
purchased from Merck and purified by distillation under reduced
pressure over calcium hydride and store over 4 Å molecular sieves.
Acetic anhydride and pyridine were also purchased from Merck
but used as received.

Results and Discussion
Monomers Synthesis. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the
novel diamine compound, 4-(1-pyrene)-2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl)
pyridine (PBAPP). The dinitro compound (PBNPP) containing
a pyridine heterocyclic ring and a pyrene pendent group was
synthesized with a modified Chichibabin reaction, which was
a facile way for the preparation of substituted pyridine.35,36The
condensation of 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde with 4′-nitroacetophe-
none in the presence of ammonium acetate afforded dinitro
(PBNPP) in one step. Reduction of the dinitro derivative
(PBNPP) in ethanol with hydrazine monohydrate in the presence
of catalytic amount of palladium on activated carbon at 90 °C
produced a new diamine compound (PBAPP). Elemental
analysis, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopes confirmed the structures
of these compounds. As shown in the experimental part, the
1H NMR spectra indicated the formation of the pyridine
heterocyclic group present at 8.50 ppm for dinitro (PBNPP)
and 7.75 ppm for diamine (PBAPP). When the dinitro com-
pound was reduced to diamine, a new signal at 5.45 ppm due
to the amino group in the 1H NMR spectrum appeared. These
results clearly confirm that the diamine (PBAPP) prepared
herein is consistent with the proposed structure.
Preparation of Poly(pyridine-imide). In this study, we
synthesized only one poly(pyridine-imide) from 6FDA. As
described in experimental part, recrystallization has to be carried
out from DMAc five times in order to get the pure dinitro
compound. The solubility of this dinitro compound is also very
poor. Furthermore, the pure diamine has to be recrystallized
two times and the preservation is also hard due to denaturaliza-
tion. Therefore, we choose 6FDA dianhydride to synthesize a
poly(pyridine-imide), because many papers reported that poly-
imides containing 6FDA show good thermal and mechanical
properties and good solubility as well as and colorless films.37,38
Colorless and transparent are important factors for optoelectrical
materials. Poly(pyridine-imide) was prepared by the conven-
tional two-steps polymerization method, as shown in Scheme
2, involving ring-opening polyaddition forming poly(amic acid)
and subsequent chemical imidization. Reaction of dianhydride
with diamine at ambient temperature gave a viscous poly(amic
acid) solution. The chemical imidization of poly(amic acid) with
a dehydrating agent such as a mixture of acetic anhydride and
pyridine was effective in obtaining the desired polyimide. The
polyimide obtained by chemical imidization had inherent
viscosity of 0.58 dLâg-1 in DMAc. The number-average
molecular weights (Mh n) and weight-average molecular weights
(Mh w) of poly(pyridine-imide) measured by GPC relative to
polystyrene standards were 2.5  104 and 5.7  104 g/mol,
respectively. The molecular weight of poly(pyridine-imide) was
sufficient to cast a tough and flexible film. The elemental
analysis values of the poly(pyridine-imide) was in agreement
with its respective structure. The FTIR spectrum exhibited
characteristic absorption bands around 1784 and 1724 cm-1 due
to the asymmetric and symmetric stretches of carbonyl group
of imide, and a band around 1371 cm-1 for the C-N bond.
The FTIR spectrum confirms the formation of the imide due to
imidization. The chemical structure of the poly(pyridine-imide)
was also verified by 1H and 13C NMR.
Polymer Properties. The solubility of the polymer was
determined by dissolving 1 mg of polymer in 1 mL of solvent
at room temperature or upon heating. The poly(pyridine-imide)
exhibited excellent solubility in various solvents such as THF,
NMP, DMAc, DMF, ç-butyrolactone at room temperature, and
pyridine, dimethyl sulfoxide, cyclohexanone upon heating to
70 °C. The bulky pendent pyrene group in the pyridine unit
and trifluoromethyl group in the dianhydride reduce packing
force and result in good solubility of the polyimide.
The thermal properties of the poly(pyridine-imide) were
evaluated in powder form by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The poly-
(pyridine-imide) did not show any glass transition up to
350 °C. The thermal stability of the poly(pyridine-imide) was
evaluated by TGA measurements in both air and nitrogen
atmospheres at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. The TGA curve
for poly(pyridine-imide) is showed in Figure 1. The poly-
(pyridine-imide) almost shows no degradation below 500 °C
in air and nitrogen. The temperatures for 10% weight loss of
poly(pyridine-imide) in nitrogen and air were 544 and 529 °C,
respectively. The good thermal stability of poly(pyridine-imide)
is due to the presence of rigid pyridine heterocyclic diamine in
the polymer backbone and a pyrene group in the pedant.39
The poly(pyridine-imide) could be cast into a film from
DMAc solution and the film was color lightness, optically
transparent, flexible and tough. The film exhibited ultimate
tensile strengths of 118 MPa, elongation to break of 14%, and
tensile modulus of 2.2 GPa. The polymer film exhibited high
tensile strength; thus it could be considered as a strong material.
Figure 2 illustrates the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence
emission spectra of the poly(pyridine-imide) in dilute THF
solution (Figure 2a,c), and solid film (Figure 2b,d) with thickness
of 87 ím. The poly(pyridine-imide) exhibited absorption
maximum (ìmax) at 283 nm due to the n-ð* transition of the
pyridine group, and the ð-ð* transitions in the region of 300-
400 nm. The photoluminescence spectra, which are attributed
to fluorescence on account of the short lifetime of the excited
states,41 were obtained by irradiative excitation at the wavelength
of maxima absorption. Moderate blue fluorescence resulted with
emission maxima at 396 nm. This indicates that photolumines-
cence took place by migration of electrons in a conduction band
(ð* level) to a valence band (ð level). The solid poly(pyridine-
imide) was prepared by spin-coating on a quartz plate from
solution of poly(pyridine-imide). The absorption band shows
very similar behavior to the solution phase. Comparing the
absorption spectrum of poly(pyridine-imide) in solution with
that of poly(pyridine-imide) in the solid state, it could be
observed that a broadened peak and long wavelength tail
appeared in the UV-vis spectra. The fluorescence maxima of
the solid film shifted toward longer wavelength than in solution
due to the formation of aggregates.40
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the absorption spectra of the
protonated poly(pyridine-imide) with HCl (hydrogen chloride)

atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °Câmin-1.

the poly(pyridine-imide) film exhibited the cutoff wavelength
and the 80% transmission wavelength at 423 and 563 nm,
respectively. Comparing this poly(pyridine-imide) film with
Ref-1 (Scheme 3) (84 ím) containing naphthalene group, this
poly(pyridine-imide) has higher cutoff wavelength and 80%
transmission wavelength than Ref-1 (380 and 459 nm). These
results were attributed to the presence of pyrene substituent in
the diamine PBAPP, which increased the electron-donating of
diamine segment and then improved both intra- and intermo-
lecular charge-transfer (CT) interactions.38,42
Figure 6 shows the emission spectra of poly(pyridine-imide)
protonated with HCl. Nevertheless, when the HCl concentration
was increased from 1  10-4 to 2.0 M, the emission at 396 nm
intensity diminished and a new strong orange fluorescence at
around 560 nm appeared and increased rapidly after HCl
concentration reaching 0.5 M. The emission band at 396 nm
results from unprotonated polymer as shown in Figure 2. The
intensity of emission peak at 560 nm is stroner than the peak at
396 nm when HCl concentration higher than 0.5 M. The
phenomenon suggested a relocation of the proton in the

The time that the exo-monomer takes to polymerize
depends on the molecular design of the monomer.18–22
Furthermore, the use of p-conjugated ﬂuorene
polymer materials as laser-generating or photoac-
tive ﬂuorescent materials is well known.23,24
In previous work, 5-(methylphthalimide)bicy-
clo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene and 5-(N-carbazolyl methyl)-
bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBCbz) were success-
fully synthesized, and their polymers also were
prepared via living ROMP using Grubbs catalyst
I {RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2}:
Poly[5-(methylphthalimide)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene]
and poly[5-(N-carbazolyl methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-
ene] proceeded in a living fashion, and hence the mo-
lecular weight could be controlled and regulated very
easily by changes in the ratio of the monomer to the
catalyst.25–29Also, a series of block copolymersderived
from these monomers could be prepared to enhance
the thermal properties.25–29 Furthermore, the chro-
mophores were incorporated into polynorbornenes by
a combination of ROMP and atom transfer radical
polymerization, and organosoluble polymeric materi-
alswithphotoluminescent propertieswere obtained.30
In this study, the functional monomers exo-2-
(ﬂuorene-9-ylcarboxymethyl)norborn-5-ene (exo-1),
exo-5-(pyrene methoxy carbonyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-
2-ene (exo-2), and exo-5-(carbazole ethoxy carbonyl)
bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (exo-3; Scheme 1) were
designed to investigate the effect of the reactivity
of the monomers on the polymerization time, living
polymerization or nonliving polymerization, molec-
ular weight, polydispersity, and yield for ROMP
using Grubbs catalyst I.

Polymerization
Polymerization of exo-1
A solution of the catalyst was prepared by the dis-
solution of RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2 (0.0075 g,
9.11 3 103 mmol) in 0.2 mL of anhydrous THF
under an argon-ﬁlled drybox. exo-1 (0.29 g, 0.911
mmol) was added to 3 mL of THF and then
degassed via a freeze–pump–thaw cycle. After com-
plete degassing, the catalyst solution was injected
into the monomer solution by a syringe. The pink
solution was vigorously stirred at 35 8C for 90 s.
The reaction was terminated by the addition of
1 mL of ethyl vinyl ether. After the termination,
the polymer was precipitated in an excess of
methanol and dried in a vacuum system at the
ambient temperature. The 1H NMR (CDCl3) spec-
trum of poly(exo-1) exhibited signals at d ¼ 1.14–
2.71 (H1, H4, H5, H6, H7), 3.75–4.13 (H8), 4.85
(H10), 5.10–5.27 (H2, H3), and 7.26–7.73 ppm
(H11) [Fig. 1(b)]. The
13C NMR (CDCl3) spectrum
of poly(exo-1) exhibited signals at d ¼ 29.58–46.27
(C1, C4, C5, C6, C7), 53.56 (C10), 69.90 (C8),

128.10, 140.72, 141.43 (C11), and 170.95 ppm (C9;
trans/cis ¼ 85/15).
Polymerization of exo-2
Poly(exo-2) was prepared by the adoption of a pro-
cedure similar to the synthesis of poly(exo-1),
with [M]/[I] ¼ [exo-2]/[RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2]
¼ 1000 ([M] ¼ monomer concentration; [I] ¼ ini-
tiator concentration), via polymerization in chlo-
roform at 35 8C for 1 h with a yield of 73%. The
polymer was insoluble in THF. The 1H NMR
(CDCl3) spectrum of poly(exo-2) exhibited signals
at d ¼ 0.40–2.91 (H1, H4, H5, H6, H7), 4.50–5.18

(H10). The
13C NMR (CDCl3) spectrum of poly
(exo-2) exhibited signals at d ¼ 41.82–50.34 (C1,

122.83–138.05 (C10), and 176.20 ppm (C8).

cedure similar to the synthesis of poly(exo-1),
with [M]/[I] ¼ [exo-3]/[RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2]
¼ 1000, via polymerization at 35 8C for 1 h. A
number-average molecular weight of 6.15 3 104
(the theoretical value was 3.31 3 105) and poly-
dispersity index (PDI) values close to 1.60 were
observed, with a yield of 14%. The 1H NMR

cates the assignments of carbons and even over-
lapped carbon peaks.
ROMP of exo-1 was carried out with the
RuCl2(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2 catalyst. Poly(exo-1)
with a high molecular weight of 3.18 3 104 ([M]/
[I] ¼ 100) was obtained in a high yield above 99%,
with a narrow PDI (1.10) for a short polymeriza-
tion time, which was as short as 90 s in THF at
35 8C [Table 1 and Fig. 3(a)]. THF was employed
as a reaction solvent to determine the molecular
weight of resulting poly(exo-1) easily because the
polymerization could be carried out in a short
time. A linear relationship of the number-average
molecular weight of poly(exo-1) increasing with
the [M]/[I] ratio, a narrow polydispersity between
1.05 and 1.10, and a yield above 99% for all ratios
([M]/[I] < 250) were observed [Figs. 3(b,c) and
4(a)], and this was an indication of a living poly-
merization. Moreover, the linear relationship of
the number-average molecular weight of poly
(exo-1) and the polymerization time is shown in
Figure 4(b). The conversion was over 95% after 90
s [Fig. 5(a)]. The semilogarithmic plot of the
monomer conversion versus the time was linear
for the ROMP of exo-1 [Fig. 5(b)].

group. However, the ROMP of pyrene- and carba-
zole-containing monomers (exo-2 and exo-3,
respectively) was carried out in a nonliving fash-
ion, as shown in Table 1. Similar behaviors for
other monomers with ester linkage groups have
been observed by Weck et al.,33 Endo et al.,34
Abdelaziz et al.,35 and Slugovc and coworkers.36,37
The observed effects are explained by different
tendencies of the anchor groups to coordinate to
the ruthenium center during the resting state of
the propagation.36,37 Slugovc and coworkers36,37
reported that neither eight-membered chelate
systems with oxo oxygen nor six-membered rings
with the oxy oxygen of the ester group are formed.
Consequently, the ROMP of exo-1 is the fastest of
the three monomers (exo-1, exo-2, and exo-3).
According to the model study of Slugovc and cow-
orkers,36,37 the anchor groups (C¼O) of exo-2 and
exo-3 are easy to coordinate to the ruthenium cen-
ter during the resting state of the propagation.
This is the reason that the ROMP behaviors of
exo-2 and exo-3 are different from that of exo-1,
and poor ROMP behaviors of exo-2 and exo-3 are
shown. Similar behavior has been observed by
Slugovc and coworkers.36,37
Solubility of Polynorbornenes Containing Various
Chromophores
The excellent solubility of these polymers was
observed in various organic solvents such as ben-
zene, chloroform, THF, CH2Cl2, N-methyl-2-pyr-
rolidinone (NMP), xylene, toluene, 1,2-dichloro-
benzene, and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc;
Table 2). Poly(exo-1) and poly(exo-3) exhibited bet-
ter solubility than poly(exo-2).
Thermal Properties of Polynorbornenes Containing
Various Chromophores
The glass transition temperatures of polynorbor-
nenes containing various chromophores were
determined to be 80–109 8C (by differential scan-
ning calorimetry), which is higher than that of
the commercially available ring-opened polynor-
bornene (35 8C), indicating that the incorporation
of the pendant aromatic moieties (e.g., ﬂuorene,
pyrene, and carbazole) could enhance the transi-
tion temperature for segmental motions of poly-
mer chains. The polymers exhibited glass transi-
tions at 80, 109, and 91 8C for poly(exo-1), poly
(exo-2), and poly(exo-3), respectively.
