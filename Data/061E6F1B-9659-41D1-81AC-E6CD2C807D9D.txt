研究摘要 
在數位資訊的時代，數位出版品已經是當今出版商的重點發展對象，但在數位出
版品蓬勃發展時，著作權的保護機制卻發展的相當緩慢。如何保護數位出版品在
發行的同時，確保產品內容在遭到盜用或修改的情況下，能更快速的分辨著作權
之歸屬，使其損失降至最低，即是此時所刻不容緩的事情。而在眾多的保護機制
中，資訊嵌入技術為大多數出版商用來保護自家出版品所廣為使用的技術之一，
但需注意的是，在利用資訊嵌入技術保護出版品時，多少會破壞到出版品的品質，
如此一來便降低了出版品的閱讀性與其價值。本研究將針對數位影像，利用直方
圖位移法並配合預測法來製作易碎型數位浮水印，降低出版品在嵌入資訊時所產
生的破壞，且可將受保護的影像回復到原來的影像。本研究除了能保護出版品的
著作權外，更可提升出版品的閱讀性，進而提升產品價值。

本計劃以著作權的保護為主題，將資訊嵌入在創作者發表的作品，以落實保護其
著作權。如果能落實著作權的保護，對我國民眾在智慧財產權的保護機制上勢必
會有所提升，如此一來更能減少一些盗版與竄改的問題，以提升我國之良好素質
與形象。 
出版界對於資訊嵌入技術這一領域較不熟悉，這次的產學案也成功的將資訊嵌入
技術引進到出版業，使得數位產品得以保護。當公司有版權爭議與陷入不必要的
紛爭時，外界在未認清其擁有權的情況下，容易造成公司的整體形象不利，我們
可以透過這個技術，在第一時間提出證據來釐清，一方面可以證實產品之所有權，
另一方面也可以為公司形象帶來正面的幫助。 
histogram-shifting 的技術來看，不準確的插值將導致該 pixel 不但不能用來嵌入資
訊，同時還是必須被 shift 一個單位，因而造成影像不必要的破壞。因此我們可以
在複雜之處配置較多的參考像素，用以提高內插的準確度，同時也可減少該處之
pixel 被 shift 的機會。此外，內插值在太過複雜的地方通常不準確，因此在過於複
雜的地方，我們可以將它全數當成是參考像素，以確保該處的 pixel 值不會被修改。 
可利用之產業及可開發之產品 
隨著網際網路的時代發展蓬勃，許多傳統媒體已漸漸轉為數位型態，這不僅使我
們的生活更便利，也大大的提升生活的水準。而傳統出版品為了因應數位時代的
需求，紛紛推出電子書、影音光碟等數位配件。企業此時也面臨了數位出版品內
容的智慧財產權保護問題，我們可以利用資訊安全技術解決這類的問題。資訊安
全對於數位出版品的保護，更具有研發的價值與應用性，而本技術針對數位影像
之保護，利用在數位影像之應用上，由於數位影像的適用性廣，舉凡產品中能套
入影像的數位產品皆能適用。而本技術主要應用在保護創作者的著作權，以防止
第三者的竄改、盗取，而且當本身所有權遭受到傷害時，可以利用這個技術，將
嵌入的資訊取出，以證明對產品的所有權。

This paper proposes a reversible data hiding method based on image interpolation and the detection of
smooth and complex regions in the cover images. A binary image that represents the locations of refer-
ence pixels is constructed according the local image activity. In complex regions, more reference pixels
are chosen and, thus, fewer pixels are used for embedding, which reduces the image degradation. On
the other hand, in smooth regions, less reference pixels are chosen, which increases the embedding
capacity without introducing signiﬁcant distortion. Pixels are interpolated according to the constructed
binary image, and the interpolation errors are then used to embed data through histogram shifting.
The pixel values in the cover image are modiﬁed one grayscale unit at most to ensure that a high quality
stego image can be produced. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides better
image quality and embedding capacity compared with prior works.

1. Introduction
Data hiding is a technique that conceals secret data into a car-
rier to convey messages [1]. Digital images are one of the media
that is suitable to convey messages due to several reasons. Firstly,
digital images are often transmitted over the Internet which would
arouse little suspicion. Secondly, the high correlation between pix-
els provides rich space for data embedding [2]. When a digital im-
age is used as a carrier, the image used to embed data is called the
cover image, and the image with data embedded is called the stego
image. In the embedding process, the pixels of the cover image are
modiﬁed and thus, distortion occurs.
In general, the more the cover image is distorted, the more vul-
nerable is the stego image to steganalytic attempts [3]. To prevent
the stego image from being suspicious and detected, either visually
or statistically, the distortions caused by data embedding should be
as small as possible, which imply that a high quality embedded im-
age is demanded [4]. Formost of the existing data hiding techniques,
the distortions caused by data embedding are permanent, i.e., the
stego image cannot be restored to its original state [3,5,6]. However,
for some applications, such as medical or military images, it is
desired that the original cover image can be completely recovered
because of the requirements for legal considerations or high-
precision nature [7]. To fulﬁll these requirements, the reversible
data hiding scheme for high quality images is introduced.
In 2003, Tian [8] proposed a reversible data hidingmethod using
the difference expansion technique. In his method, one bit can be
embedded into two consecutive pixels; therefore, the maximum
embedding capacity is 0.5 bpp. Alattar [9] generalized the differ-
ence expansion technique so that n  1 bits can be embedded into
n pixels, resulting themaximum embedding capacity (n  1)/n bpp.
However, the difference expansion based reversible data hiding
methods have to double the differences between pixels; therefore,
a larger distortion occurs and may not be suitable for applications
where high quality images are demanded. In 2006, Ni et al. [7]
proposed a novel histogram-shifting reversible data hiding tech-
nique. In Ni et al.’s method, pixel values are modiﬁed one grayscale
value at most and thus, a high quality stego image can be achieved.
However, themaximumpayload is limited by the peak height of the
image histogram; therefore, the payload of their method is
relatively low. Hwang et al. [10] also proposed a reversible data hid-
ing method based on histogram-shifting and had better embedding
efﬁciency than Ni et al.’s work. In 2007, Thodi and Rodriguez [11]
proposed a very different method by expanding the prediction
errors. Because the prediction error is usually smaller than the dif-
ference between two consecutive pixel values, the stego image
quality obtained by their method is better than that of Tian’s
method. However, Thodi and Rodriguez’s method is also based on
expansion-embedding technique, a larger distortion may occur;
therefore, their method is not suitable for applications requiring
high quality images.

Let the size of the cover image I be M M, the procedure to con-
struct the reference pixels using RPDM is listed below:
Step 1: Initialize a binary image B with size M M to record the
positions of reference pixels. The pixels valued 0 in B rep-
resent the corresponding positions in the cover image I
that are reference pixels, and valued 1, otherwise.
Step 2: For 0 6 i, j 6M  1, sequentially scan the pixels in the bin-
ary image B, and the value of Bi,j is set according to the fol-
lowing rule:
Bi;j ¼
0; modði;DÞ ¼ 0 and modðj;DÞ ¼ 0;
1; otherwise;

where D is a pre-deﬁned integer and mod(x,y) is a function
that returns the reminder of x/y. This step is equivalent to
place the reference pixels with distanceD along the vertical
and horizontal directions.
Step 3: For pixels Ii,j satisfying 0 6 i  D, j  D, i +D, j + D <M, if
Bi;j ¼ 0; modði=Dþ j=D;2Þ ¼ 0, and
RangeðIiD;j; Ii;jD; IiþD;j; Ii;jþDÞ < T0;
where T0 is a pre-deﬁned threshold, then Ii,j is likely located
in a smooth region. In this case, Bi,j is set to 1, which is
equivalent to set Ii,j to be a non-reference pixel.
Step 4: For pixels Ii,j satisfying 0 6 i + D, j + D 6M, if Bi,j, Bi+D,j, Bi,j+D
and Bi+D,j+D are all 0, this means that these pixels are refer-
ence pixels. If
RangeðIi;j; IiþD;j; Ii;jþD; IiþD;jþDÞ > T1
where T1 is a pre-deﬁned threshold, these four reference
pixels are likely located in a complex region. In this case,
Bi0 ;j0 ; i 6 i
0 6 iþ D; j 6 j0 6 jþ D are set to 0. This is equiva-
lent to mark all the pixels enclosed by these four reference
pixels as reference pixels.
A binary imageBwhich records thepositionsof the referencepix-
els can be generated from the steps listed above. In the embedding
process, the binary image B can be served as a reference to embed
data. Note that the same binary image B can be constructed from
the stego image directly by performing the same steps listed above
and thus, it is not necessary to keep B. We use a simple example to
demonstrate how to distribute the reference pixels. Suppose there
is a cover image I sized 10  10, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Let T0 = 5,
T1 = 50 and D = 3. Fig. 2(b) shows the binary image B after ﬁnishing
Step 2, where the positions of reference pixels are shaded. In the
binary image B, reference pixels I3,3 and I6,6 satisfy modði=Dþ
j=D;2Þ ¼ 0. Note that Range(I0,3, I3,0, I6,3, I3,6) = j37  34j = 3 < T0;
therefore, I3,3 is marked as non-reference pixel, as shown in
Fig. 2(c). Finally, Range(I6,6, I6,9, I9,6, I9,9) = 155, which is larger than
T1; therefore, all the pixels enclosed by these four reference pixels
are marked as reference pixels, as shown in Fig. 2(d).
Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows two binary images constructed by differ-
ent D. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the complex regions, such as edges,
are darker than other regions. This indicates that these regions are
set as the reference pixels. On the other hand, the black dots are
relatively sparser in the smooth regions such as on Lena’s shoulder.
The sparser dots indicate that some reference pixels in the smooth
region have been removed.
2.2. Embedding procedure
After the binary image B is constructed, the embedding proce-
dure can begin. During embedding, pixels values will be modiﬁed
one grayscale unit at most according to the corresponding interpo-
lation errors. In this case, the overﬂow or underﬂow problems
might occur because pixels valued 0 or 255 might be modiﬁed to
1 or 256, respectively. To prevent this problem, pixels that may
cause overﬂow or underﬂow are pre-processed as follows [13].
For pixels valued 0 and 255 in the cover image, their positions
are recorded in a location map and the pixel values are set to 1
and 254, respectively. Because the pixel values are modiﬁed one
grayscale unit at most in the embedding process, the pre-processed
cover image will never have pixels overﬂow or underﬂow. The
embedding procedure is shown in Fig. 4, and the detailed proce-
dure is listed as follows:
Input: Cover image I of size M M, encrypted secret data S,
two thresholds (T0,T1) and the distance between ref-
erence pixels D.
Output: Stego image Is, peaks pe and p
þ
e ; jLM j and jSj.
Step 1: Scan the cover image I and record the positions of
those pixels valued 0 and 255. The recorded positions
are served as a locationmap and are compressedusing
a run-length coder. The result is denoted by LM. Con-
catenate LM and S to obtain the bit stream LS. Pixels val-
ued 0 and 255 are then modiﬁed to 1 and 254,
respectively. Let the modiﬁed cover image be I
0
.
Step 2: Use the modiﬁed cover image I
0
with the parameters
D, T0, T1 and employ RPDM to generate the binary
image B, as described in Section 2.1. Let B0 and B1
be the sets of positions (i, j) satisfying Bi,j = 0 and
Bi,j = 1, respectively.

Step 6: Scan the interpolation errors. If Ei;j ¼ pþe or Ei;j ¼ pe ,
then the scanned interpolation error is capable of
embedding one bit. In this case, one bit b is extracted
from LS. If b = 0, set E
0
i;j ¼ Ei;j. If b = 1 and Ei;j ¼ pþe , set
E0i;j ¼ pþe þ 1; if b = 1 and Ei;j ¼ pe , set E0i;j ¼ pe  1. If
Ei;j–pþe and Ei;j–p

e , then this interpolation error can-
not be used to embed data. In this case, if Ei;j > pþe , set
E0i;j ¼ Ei;j þ 1; if Ei;j < pe , set E0i;j ¼ Ei;j  1.
Step 7: The stego image Is can be obtained by adding up the
interpolation value P and the modiﬁed interpolation
errors E
0
. The parameter D, peaks pe and p
þ
e , thresh-
olds T0 and T1, and the sizes of LM and S (denoted
by jLMj and jSj, respectively) are recorded and served
as a key for decoding.
For most natural images, pe and p
þ
e are very close to 0 or simply
0; therefore, three bits are sufﬁcient to record them. We use 16 bits
to record T0 and T1, two bits to record D, and use dlog2jLMje and
dlog2jSje bits to record the length of LM and S, respectively. There-
fore, the key size is
2 3þ 16þ 2þ dlog2jLMje þ dlog2jSje
¼ 24þ dlog2jLM je þ dlog2jSje bits:
For a 512  512 image, the size of LM is usually less than 10 kbits,
and the size of S is less than 100 kbits. Therefore, the key size for
most natural images will less than 24 + dlog2104e + dlog2105e = 54
bits.
2.3. Extraction and restoration procedures
When the receiver has the stego image and the key, the embed-
ded secret data can be extracted and the stego image can be re-
stored to its original state. The detailed procedure is listed below:
Input: Stego image Is of size M M, two peaks pe and
pþe ; jLM j; jSj; D; T0 and T1.
Output: Cover image I and secret data S.
Step 1: Construct the binary image B of the stego image Is with
the parameters D, T0 and T1 using RPDM described in
Section 2.1.
Step 2: Scan the stego image Is and interpolate the value of
non-reference pixels using the corresponding neighbor-
ing reference pixels. The interpolation result is denoted
by P. Note that the binary image B constructed in Step 1
and interpolation result P obtained in this step are
exactly the same as B and P obtained in the embedding
phase.
Step 3: For the positions satisfying (i, j) 2 B1, subtract Pi,j from
Isi,j. The result is the modiﬁed interpolation error E
0
i;j.
Step 4: Scan the modiﬁed interpolation error E
0
. If the scanned
position ði; jÞ 2 B1; E0i;j has been probably modiﬁed in
the embedding phase and possibly one bit is embedded.
To extract the embedded bit, if E0i;j ¼ pþe or E0i;j ¼ pe , one
bit 0 is extracted; if E0i;j ¼ pþe þ 1 or E0i;j ¼ pe  1, one bit
1 is extracted. Repeat this step until jLSj = jLMj + jSj bits
have been extracted.
Step 5: To restore the stego image to the original cover image,
E
0
has to be recovered to its original state in advance. To
do this, the elements of E
0
are scanned. If E0i;j > p
þ
e , set
Ei;j ¼ E0i;j  1; if E0i;j < pe , set Ei;j ¼ E0i;j þ 1; otherwise, set
Ei;j ¼ E0i;j.
Step 6: Adding up the interpolation value P and the original
interpolation error E, the pre-processed image I
0
can
be obtained.
Step 7: In the extracted bit stream, the ﬁrst jLMj bits record the
compressed location map, and other jSj bits record the
embedded secret data. The position information
recorded in LM is extracted. Those pixels valued 1 or
254 in I
0
with positions recorded in LM are then set back
to 0 or 255, respectively. The resulting image is the ori-
ginal cover image I.
3. Experimental results
To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, six
common test images, Lena, Jet, Elaine, Boat, Peppers and Baboon,
of size 512  512 obtained from USC image database [21] were
employed as the cover images, as shown in Fig. 5. Note that these
color images were transformed into 8-bit grayscale images if they
were originally in color format. The secret bits were generated by
using a pseudo-random number generator. Matlab 7.0 was used
for the program writing and running under an Intel E7500 CPU
with 2 GB RAM.
3.1. Comparison of interpolation methods and threshold values
To compare the effect of the interpolation methods to the
embedding efﬁciency, we used the test image Lena as the cover im-
age, set T0 = 0, T1 = 255, D = 2 and used different interpolation
methods-nearest neighbor, bi-linear and bi-cubic to perform the
experiments. The results are shown in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 6, the results obtained from bi-linear and bi-
cubic method achieve better image quality than that of the nearest
neighbor interpolation method at all embedding rates. Note that

is the lowest. However, decreasing T1 will increase the stego image
quality but will lead to lower embedding capacity. This is because a
decrease in T1 turns more non-reference pixels into reference pix-
els. These reference pixels cannot be used to embed data but are
effectively prevented from being modiﬁed; therefore, the stego im-
age quality is increased.
Fig. 8 gives the comparison resultswhen setting T1 = 255 andvar-
ies T0 to show the effects caused by T0. In this ﬁgure, the test image
Lena was used and D was set to 2. As shown in the ﬁgure, when
T0 = 8, the payload is slightly higher than that of T0 = 0. This is be-
cause setting T0 = 8 slightlydecreases thenumberof referencepixels
in smooth regions and thus the payload increased. However, if T0
was raised to 80, excessive reference pixels will be changed to
non-reference pixels. This may cause the interpolation less accurate
and, subsequently, result in a slightly decrease in image quality.
As can be seen from the above experiments, the payload can be
increased by selecting a larger T0, and the quality can be enhanced
by decreasing T1. Therefore, the parameters T0 and T1 can be chosen
to maximize the image quality for a given payload.
3.2. Comparison of the maximum payload and PSNR values

to be modiﬁed one grayscale value at most; therefore, only single
layer embedding is considered in the experiments. For single layer
embedding, the PSNR value is guaranteed to be higher than
10log10(2552/1) = 48.13 dB.
Table 1 shows the comparisons of maximum payload P‘ and the
corresponding PSNR with Ni et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, Tsai et al.’s, and
Luo et al.’s methods for six test images. In Ni et al.’s method, two
pairs of peak and zero points were selected for data embedding.
In Kim et al.’s method, four sub-sampled images were used and
embedding level L was set to 0. In Tsai et al.’s method, the block
size was set to 3  3, as suggested in their paper. In the proposed
method, we set T0 = 8, T1 = 60 and bi-linear interpolation is em-
ployed. Because in Kim et al.’s, Tsai et al.’s, and the proposed meth-
od, the reference pixels are not designed to carry data bits, to make
a fair comparison, the reference pixels in Luo et al.’s method are
implemented carrying no data. These settings ensured that pixels
in the cover image in each method were modiﬁed one grayscale
unit at most, so that a high quality stego image can be obtained.
Table 1 reveals that the proposed method performs better than
Ni et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, Tsai et al.’s methods and is comparable to
Luo et al.’s method. For example, for the Lena, Jet, Boat, and Pep-
pers images, the proposed method achieves the highest payload
and PSNR. For the test images Elaine and Baboon, the maximum
payload of the proposed method is slightly lower than that of
Luo et al.’s method but with higher PSNR. However, the perfor-
mance of the proposed method can be enhanced by adjusting the
parameters T0 and T1. For example, if we set T0 = 8 and T1 = 120,
the maximum payload of the Baboon image is 15,003 at
49.67 dB, which is better than that of Luo et al.’s method.
We also test the performance of the proposed method and Ni
et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, Tsai et al.’s, and Luo et al.’s method for 1000
images of size 512  512 randomly selected from a large image
database [22]. Many researches [23,24] adopt images in this data-
base as their standard test images. The results are listed in Table 2.
Note that the images in [22] are taken from modern digital cam-
eras which produce impressive image quality with low image
noise; therefore, a higher prediction accuracy is obtained in theses
test images and subsequently, results in a larger maximum
payload.
The results shown in Table 2 revealed that the proposed method
performs better than Ni et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, and Tsai et al.’s meth-
ods and is comparable to Luo et al.’s method. The maximum pay-
load of the proposed method is slightly higher than that of Luo
et al.’s method under almost equivalent image quality. However,
the maximum payload and PSNR are both higher than those of
Ni et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, and Tsai et al.’s methods.
3.3. Performance comparison for various payloads
Fig. 9(a)–(f) are the comparisons of the proposed method with
Ni et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, Tsai et al.’s, and Luo et al.’s methods for dif-
ferent test images under various payloads. In the proposed meth-
od, we varied T1 and set T0 = dT1/10e to obtain the payload–PSNR
curves.
Fig. 9(a)–(f) reveals that the stego image quality of the proposed
method outperforms other methods for various payloads. Luo
et al.’s method performs better than Ni et al.’s, Kim et al.’s, and Tsai
et al.’s methods, however, these methods provide no solution to
select better regions for data embedding. On the other hand, the
proposed method offers a mechanism to select pixels that are
likely embeddable and exclude those pixels that are likely un-
embeddable. Therefore, even if the nearest neighbor interpolation
method is used, the quality of stego image is still higher than those
of other methods. Take the smooth image Lena and complex image
Baboon as examples, when the nearest neighbor interpolation
method is used and set D = 3, the PSNR of Lena image of the pro-
posed method is 52.5 dB at 0.1 bpp; whereas Luo et al.’s method
is comparable to the proposed method and other methods achieve
only around 51 dB. For the Baboon image, the PSNR of the proposed
method is 55.9 dB at 0.02 bpp; whereas only around 52–53 dB can
be obtained in other methods.
When the interpolation is set to bi-linear, the proposed method
achieves the best performance. It is interesting to note that setting
D = 2 will generally obtain better capacity–PSNR curves for most
images than setting D = 3. This is because more pixels will be se-
lected as the reference pixels and thus provides the bi-linear inter-
polation method a more accurate interpolation result.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a reversible data hiding method based
on image interpolation technique. In previous works, the reference
pixels are distributed equally spaced and provide no mechanism
to distribute these pixels based on local image characteristics.
Besides, the pixels are interpolated or predicted by their nearest
neighbors, resulting in a decrease in payload. The proposed method
employsbetterprediction techniques andoffers amechanismtoadd
or remove reference pixels based on local image characteristics, i.e.,
reducing the number of reference pixels in smooth regions to
increase the payload and increasing the number of reference pixels
in complex regions to prevent excessive image degradation. The
experimental results revealed that the proposed method achieves
better PSNR for all embedding rates than those of prior works.
