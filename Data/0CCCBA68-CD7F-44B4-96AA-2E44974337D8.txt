INTRODUCTION 
 
Studies on the melting behaviors of semi-crystalline polymers including syndiotactic 
polypropylene (sPP),1,2 syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS),3 poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK),4,5 
poly(1,4-phenyl sulfide) (PPS)6 and terephthalic polyesters like poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
(PET)5,7,8 and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT),9-12 have been vastly reported in the literature 
pertaining to polymer science. The complex multiple melting characteristic of these polymers, 
which is further complicated by the presence of polymorphic crystallites in some the polymers (e.g. 
sPS, sPP etc.), evokes more challenge in discerning the origin of melting peaks.  Two general 
mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain the multiple melting behavior, which 
may vary from a polymer to another polymer.  First, the most widely discussed one, is the heating 
scan-induced melting/re-crystallization/re-melting of the crystalline lamellae, which is mainly 
based on the behavior of endotherms obtained from the differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC).13,14 A re-organization model describes the transformation of less stable and/or imperfect 
flat-on lamellae to more stable/perfect edge-on lamellae through melting/re-crystallization upon 
scanning to higher temperatures.  The alternative proposition is based on presumption of 
pre-existing crystalline entities (dual/multiple), which includes the crystalline substructures like 
lamellae and spherulites present in the semi-crystalline polymers.4,15  Thus, it is imperative to 
interpret the multiple melting peaks in terms of the different crystalline forms present in the bulk of 
the polymer matrix.   
Recently, the multiple melting behaviors of three homologous series of terephthalic polyesters, 
i.e., poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT),16 poly(pentamethylene terephthalate) (PPT),17 and 
poly(hexamethylene terephthalate) (PHT),17,18 have been reported.  PTT crystallizes in triclinic 
structure like PET, but in the oriented fibers, only the fully extended form is observed for PET, 
whereas the contracted form is solely found in PTT.  The multiple melting peaks in PET are 
attributed to the co-existing multiple crystalline entities with a broad distribution of lamellar 
thickness during normal scanning, and re-organization only occurs by extended annealing at 
specified temperatures.7  However, for PTT, the multiple melting could very well be caused by 
either pre-existing lamellae of different thickness or a consequence of the melting/reorganization 
process.16  On the contrary, for both PBT19 and PPT,20,21 two distinct crystal forms were identified 
and defined in terms of α and β forms with triclinic chain packing.  However, on mechanical 
deformation structural transformation from α form (contracted conformation) to β form (extended 
conformation) occurs in both the polymer.  The polymer chain of PPT on normal annealing 
crystallizes to unique α form, which remains intact with changing the crystallization temperature 
and/or thermal treatments.17 Thus, the multiple melting behavior of annealed PPT can only be 
described in terms of melting/re-crystallization model due to absence of any polymorphism.  PHT 
yields three different types of crystalline structures depending on thermal and/or solution treatments, 
which are designates as α, β, and γ forms respectively.22-24 The α form in PHT with a monoclinic 
chain packing is favorably formed by crystallization under stressed condition.  Both the β and γ

transformation due to thermal scanning and/or annealing by performing thorough and systematic 
studies on melt-crystallized PHT followed by logical analyses. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Materials and sample preparation   
PHT was synthesized using butyl titanate as catalyst according to the method reported 
earlier.17,30  The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) measured 
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) are 13,800 g/mol and 2.0, respectively.   The apparent 
melting temperature of 144.5ºC for the synthesized PHT was characterized using a DSC, and 
Tg=-6.7oC.  Note that the polymeric chain in the synthesized PHT contains at least 30 repeat units.  
At this MW, maybe the mechanical properties are on lower sides, but its thermal and physical 
properties (Tg, Tm, crystallization, crystals, etc.) are expected to be closely characteristic of a 
polymer.  Some of thermal transition temperatures in this PHT may be slightly lower than a really 
longer-chain PHT, but the characteristic of crystals, multiple melting peaks remained almost the 
same as those in longer-chain PHT. 
Apparatus 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry.  The melting behavior of the PHT samples were 
investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-7, Perkin-Elmer) equipped with a 
mechanical intracooler under nitrogen purge to ensure minimal sample degradation.  Temperature 
and heat flow calibrations at different heating rates were done using indium and zinc.  Data were 
collected and peaks de-convolution analyzed by using a Pyris software (Perkin-Elmer Corp.).   
For melt-crystallization treatments, samples were first melted at 180ºC for 10 min and quickly 
cooled (quenching) at a rate of -320ºC/min to desired isothermal temperatures (120-140ºC).  Note 
here that -320ºC/min cooling rate can be set up but actually not fully realized because the actual 
cooling may be slightly lower than the set rate owing to heat transfer hindrance.  Even the actual 
cooling rate was less than the set-up, the PHT samples were still effectively quenched into 
amorphous state.  Another method of more effective quenching included melting, dipping the 
sample pans into a liquid N2 container, then placing into DSC cells.  However, problem of 
moisture sipping into DSC samples pans could be hard to deal with; and thus liquid N2 dipping was 
not used unless no other alternatives.   
For determining the transition temperatures a dynamic heating rate of 10ºC/min was used 
unless otherwise indicated.  Annealing treatment was performed for better resolution of the 
melting peaks.  The samples were heated up to the annealing temperature at a heating rate of 
10ºC/min after melt crystallization at 130ºC for 120 min and annealed at the desired temperature for 
further 120 min.  The overlapped melting peaks were properly de-convoluted and DSC profile was 
separated into several components by the software Origin 6.1.  Peak-fit routines were used to fit the 
 5
amorphous layer (la) were obtained from the one-dimensional correlation function according to 
standard procedures.31

both low and high q.  Linear extrapolation to zero q is accomplished by the Debye-Bueche model

q region (0.1-1.5 nm-1). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Figure 1 exhibits DSC thermograms (10ºC/min) of the PHT samples isothermally 
melt-crystallized for 2h at various temperatures (Tc) ranging from 90 to 120ºC (labeled on the 
individual traces).  Numerous melting endotherms are apparent in all the DSC traces.  As many 
as five distinct endotherms, labeled as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 (from low to high temperature), are 
observed in PHT crystallized at 90 and 100ºC.  The lamellar crystals associated with each of these 
five melting peaks are subsequently designated as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5-crystals.  Moreover, two 
exotherms (crystallization peaks) are distinctly visible trailing the melting of P1 and P2.  Both 
thermograms appear very similar, but P2 increases in intensity with the increase in Tc from 90 to 
100ºC.  Temperature positions of these melting peaks (except P3 and P5) also shift to higher 
temperature as the crystallization temperature is enhanced.  Interestingly, only four endotherms 
can be observed during DSC scanning of PHT melt-crystallized at 110ºC (albeit sample crystallized 
for less than 60 min at the same temperature show five endotherms18).  P4 gradually shifts to a 
higher temperature with rise in crystallization temperature to 110ºC and eventually merges with P5 
 7
imposed on PHT.  However, P6 is no longer visible in the PHT samples crystallized at a 
temperature higher than 120ºC (at Tc= 130º and140ºC), which is likely to be overlapped by very 
strong P5 to develop a new peak P5″=(P4+5+6) (P4 already merges with P5 at Tc= 120ºC).  
Interestingly, all the endothermic peaks P1, P2 and P3 are evident (partially merged) along with P5″ 
in the DSC trace of PHT crystallized at 130ºC, which further indicates at least existence of discrete 
and different lamellar types at such high temperature of crystallization.  In consistence with 
reports earlier, only a single endothermic peak of PHT is revealed at Tc= 140°C for 8h even by the 
DSC scanning rate of 2.5°C/min, suggesting the melting of only one homogeneous crystalline 
lamellae.18   
It was reported earlier that the endothermic peaks P1 and P3 are due to the melting of α-form, 
while P2 and P5 were believed to be associated with the β-forms of PHT.18,29  For further 
clarification of the crystalline forms attributed to the multiple melting endotherms of PHT, 
experiments were performed with DSC to impose various thermal events on the samples, which 
were identically melt-crystallized at 120°C for 2h to develop maximum crystallinity.  Figure 4 
exhibits DSC thermograms of PHT samples subjected to four different thermal treatments.  First 
sample was normally scanned at 10°C /min from 120 to 180°C just after the completion of 
crystallization, resulting the total sum of melting enthalpy of P1, P2, P3 and P5* to 50.4 J/g (Fig. 4a).  
The second sample was scanned from 120 to 136°C at a rate of 10°C/min and annealed at 136°C 
for 2h to complete the melting of P1 and re-crystallization.  It was then scanned up at 10°C/min 
from 136 to 180°C and a typical broad endotherm of several combined peaks was obtained (Fig. 
4b). The overlapped melting peaks were further decomposed to numerous component peaks 
(Figure 5) by using a peak-fitting software.  Deconvolution of the merged endotherm of the 
second sample resulted in separation of the profile into several component peaks and revealed three 
melting peaks P2, P3 and P5* (Fig. 5a) with the total enthalpy for melting being 53.5 J/g.  Similar 
number of endothermic peaks was also evident on slower thermal scanning (DSC thermograms are 
not shown here for brevity).  The increment of total enthalpy by 3.1 J/g and shifting of peak 
temperatures of P2, P3 and P5* to higher temperatures further indicates that once P1 (thinner 
lamellae of α-forms) melted away in scanning, it fast rearranged into crystallites of higher melting 
temperatures like P3 (α-forms having thicker lamellar structure) and/or P4.  The third samples was 
scanned from 120 to 139°C at a rate of 10°C/min and annealed at 139°C for 4h for completion of 
the melting of P1 and P2, and re-crystallization of the same.  It was further scanned up from 139 to 
180°C at a scanning rate of 10°C/min and again a broad endotherm of multiple overlapped peaks 
resulted (Fig. 4c).  However, peak deconvolution revealed the individual P3 and P5* (Fig. 5b) and 
the total enthalpy of melting is found to be 50.9 J/g.  Nevertheless, P3 was exhibited as only a 
shoulder to P5 on slower DSC scanning (DSC thermograms are not shown here for brevity).  The 
lowering of enthalpy suggests that melting of P2 (thinner lamellae of β-forms) was not readily 
followed by repacking into P4, P5 (thicker lamellae of β-forms) and/or P6.  However, shifting of 
peak temperatures of P3 and P5* to higher temperatures suggests the development of more perfect 
crystals due to annealing at high temperature.  The final samples was scanned from 120 to 143°C 
 9
above observation, the increase of α-form in third sample can be justified by assigning it to the 
endotherm P4 (here merged with P5 and P6 to form P5*), which is likely to form due to the more 
perfect and thickest crystalline lamellae of α-form, on annealing at 139ºC for 4h.  However, on 
further annealing at 143ºC for 6h (fourth sample), which is too close to the original melting peak of 
P4 (~144ºC in third sample, Fig. 5b), a part of the α-form melted and may be repacked to β-form 
that can enhance the WAXD reflections of β-form in expense of the α-form.   
DSC thermogram of the PHT sample melt-crystallized at 130ºC for 2h yielded only two 
endotherms (P1*=P1+2 and P5′=P3+4+5) when dynamically scanned at 10ºC/min (earlier in Fig. 2e).  
Interestingly, on further resolution of the melting peaks by slower scanning rate (2.5ºC/min) four 
peaks (P1, P2, P3 and P5″=P4+5+6) were revealed (Fig. 3e).  Thus, a significant change in peak 
formation and their temperature position is observed with decrease in DSC scanning rate.  Further 
experiments were performed for detailed understanding of the effect of crystallization time (tc) on 
the melting behavior and identification of the crystalline form associated with the resulting 
endotherms of PHT crystallized at 130ºC.   
The complex melting behavior of PHT subjected to melt-crystallization at 130ºC for various 
time (2-24h) are illustrated in Figure 7.  P1, P2, and P3 (having different lamellar structures) are 
visible as partially overlapped peaks and P5″ (=P4+5+6) is apparent as a separate peak in the DSC 
trace (scanning rate = 2.5 ºC/min) of PHT crystallized at 130ºC for 2h (Fig. 7a).  Temperature 
positions of P1, P2 and P3 are enhanced with increase in tc to 8h (Fig. 7b).  Most significant 
increment in temperature is observed for P3 (~2.5ºC), but the peak temperature of P5* remains 
almost constant (~144.5ºC) while P6 appears (~145.5ºC) as a shoulder to P5*.  P1 and P2 
eventually merge to develop a single peak at higher temperatures when tc is increased to 24h (Fig. 
7c).  Moreover, P3 also merges with P5* to yield a stronger peak without changing the temperature 
position of P5*, and P6 is also distinctly apparent at a little bit higher temperature (~146.5ºC).  
Thus, with increase in tc the peak temperature of P3 is most significantly shifted to higher value, 
while P4 is never divulged as a separate peak.  Again, at tc = 24h, P3 merges with P5* to produce a 
quite sharp peak, where P3 and P4 become indistinguishable.  Thus, the thickness of crystalline 
lamellae of P3 is likely to increase with annealing time and eventually become similar to that of the 
pre-existing P4 crystalline lamellae, which can be conceived as most perfect α-crystals that remains 
unchanged like P5 (both merge to P5*) with increase in tc.  However, P6 is assumed to correlate the 
thickest lamellae of β-forms, which melts at significantly higher temperature (thermally more 
stable) than the α-forms.  Its thickness continues to increase with tc and results in higher peak 
temperature.   
The crystalline form associated with the melting peak P4 in PHT samples crystallized at 130ºC 
were elaborately analyzed by performing the thermal annealing treatments.  Figure 8 depicts 
WAXD patterns of PHT samples subjected to three different thermal events.  DSC thermograms 
(scanned up to180°C at a heating rate of 2.5ºC/min) of the same samples are shown inset.  The 
diffraction pattern and DSC trace of PHT sample melt-crystallized at 140ºC are also shown for 
better clarification of the crystalline forms (Fig. 8d).  First one is the typical PHT sample 
 11
Generally, at higher crystallization temperature (Tc>120ºC), the PHT crystalline lamella assumes 
two different types of spherulite with significantly large dimension, one being a typical 
Maltese-cross type and the other resembles a dendritic spherulite.  It has been also reported that 
the lower melting Maltese-cross spherulite consists of α-forms, on the contrary, the higher-melting 
β-forms are packed to a dendritic spherulite.  However, the PHT sample crystallized at 140ºC 
exhibits a unique dendritic spherulite containing entirely β-form.18   
Figure 9 shows optical micrographs of PHT sample at different time interval while annealing 
at 143ºC after melt-crystallization at 130ºC for 2h and scanned up to 143ºC at a rate of 10ºC/min.  
A dual crystalline morphology (Maltese-cross and dendritic-type spherulites) is evident in the 
sample melt-crystallized at 130ºC for 2h (Fig. 9a).  As the sample was heated to 143ºC (to melt P1, 
P2 and P3), a hazy and smoky picture resulted at the first minute, which is possibly due to partial 
melting of the crystalline species (as the dendritic species are still apparent) (Fig. 9b).  However, 
within five minutes the crystalline morphology reappeared and dendritic spherulites are distinctly 
apparent, while the Maltese-cross spherulites are still almost dark as amorphous phase (Fig. 9c).  
After 2h of annealing (Fig. 9d) almost all the Maltese-cross spherulites are apparent along with the 
dendritic ones and the morphological pattern looks very similar to the first sample (Fig. 9a).  
Moreover, the micrograph looks very clear on annealing the sample for 6h (Fig. 9e), and an 
unaltered crystalline pattern is evident.  Nevertheless, on further heating of the sample to 148ºC 
(for melting P4) a preferential melting of the Maltese-cross spherulites was observed to yield dark 
amorphous phase admixed with intact dendritic type spherulites (Fig. 9f), which eventually melted 
at higher temperature.   
The above observation further lends support in the correlation between α-forms and melting 
peak P4.  The Maltese-cross type spherulites present even after annealing at 143ºC are most likely 
to contain the thickest crystalline lamellae of α-forms and are manifested as the P4 endotherm with 
a lower melting temperature than P5, as they evidently melt before the dendritic spherulites 
(β-forms) on heating beyond 143ºC.  Moreover, an additional point has been surfaced from the 
PLM observation, which is imperative to be addressed for further clarification of the 
transformations of PHT crystalline phases.  The PLM micrographs of PHT sample crystallized at 
130ºC and annealed at 143ºC for 2h and 6h (Fig. 9d and 9e, respectively) depict almost identical 
morphological pattern as that of the as-prepared (not-annealed) sample (Fig. 9a).  It was earlier 
discussed that the Maltese-cross spherulites are of the α-form, while the crystalline lamellae 
containing β-form generates dendritic spherulites.18 Nevertheless, the WAXD profiles of the 
samples subjected to similar thermal treatments revealed significantly different pictures.  PHT 
sample crystallized at 130ºC evidently contains a predominant fraction of α-forms admixed with 
β-forms (Fig. 8a), while in the annealed (at 143ºC) samples the population of β-form is increased 
with annealing time and after 6h of annealing β-forms are found in major proportion (Fig. 8c).  
Thus, it is difficult to correlate the crystalline forms of PHT with the evolved phase morphology by 
imposing thermal annealing treatments, as after annealing the fraction of β-form is significantly 
enhanced, which is not reflected in its spherulitic morphology. A probable reasoning can be

By considering that spherulites are volume filling, φClin is related to the bulk crystallinity, φC, 
measured by thermal analysis. According to a value of 144 J/g for 100% crystalline PHT proposed 
by David et al,28 it is reasonable to assign the first minimum as lc when the linear crystalline is 
smaller than 0.5 (a value of φC=0.385 for PHT melt-crystallized at 130oC for 120 h by DSC).  L, lc 
and la are 18.3, 6.45 and 11.85 nm, respectively, for 130oC-crystallized PHT.  When this sample 
was post-annealed at 143oC for 170min, the average lamellar thickness increased as indicated by 
lc=7.2 nm and also a corresponding long period increased to L=21.9 nm.  A large increase in 
amorphous thickness (la=L-lc) by 2.85 nm may be due to partial melting of the thinner crystalline 
between the existing thicker lamellar stacks. By contrast, the average crystal crystalline lamellae 
seem to increase slightly.  Apparently, as the heating temperature is increased to ~7oC below the 
final melting temperature there is still some re-crystallization.  However, such a re-crystallization 
proceeds extremely slowly due to confined space imposed by the remaining thicker primary 
lamellar stacks. Finally, the most amorphous phase may have been trapped between these stacks, 
giving rise to the large increase observed in the long period. 
    From the SAXS and WAXD results, we found that reorganization of lamella occurred in the 
length scale ranging from unit cell on the molecular scale up to crystal lamellar crystalline of the 
size on the order of nanometer.  Owing to the confined space provided by the un-melted primary 
lamellae, the amorphous polymer chains deriving from melting of thinner lamellae (P1+P2+P3) 
between these lamellae (P4+P5) may be unable to diffuse to the regions between spherulites (i.e., 
interspherulite).  This decreases the possibility of having interspherulitic crystallization in which 
the growth front can advance to generate the spherulites with large size. Under these circumstances, 
however, there is the possibility of generating inter-lamellar crystallization where the thicker 
lamellae due to re-crystallization may form in the existing thicker lamellae (P4+P5).  SAXS results 
further confirm PLM studies of PHT, indicating that the re-organization upon heating does not 
involve changes in the spherulitic pattern or sizes. 
Apparently, the five melting peaks (P1~ P5) seen in the low-T melt-crystallized PHT are not all 
associated with a single crystal cell, but rather with two different crystal cells (α and β).   At 
higher crystallization temperatures (140oC and up), however, only the β-crystal cell is present in 
PHT, which exhibits a decreasing number of melting peaks.  The fraction of β-form in PHT 
increases significantly at expense of the α-form through melting/re-crystallization, though no 
evidence of solid-solid transformation is seen.  A portion of the crystalline lamellae (α-form) may 
melt into amorphous constituents at the inter-lamellar zone to be followed by re-crystallization into 
thicker lamellae consisted of β-form crystal, which reduces the fraction of α-form while 
maintaining the overall Maltese-cross type morphology intact. However, a significant depression in 
re-crystallization process in terms of lamellar thickening at a higher temperature of 143oC 
consequently promoted the extent of the amorphous regions between the existing thicker lamella.  
Subsequent growth of the lamellae between these regions underwent gradually a great deal of 
 15
this study exhibits no ring patterns, similar to PBT.  Interestingly, the number of methylene groups 
between the terephthalate groups seems to determine the lamellar orientation leading to existence 
or absence of ring patterns within the spherulites.  This is true for the homologous series of aryl 
polyesters, but may not be so for other types of polymers. Future work and studies seem urgent in 
order to fully expound this intriguing behavior.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In general, a mixed intercalation/exfoliation is revealed for most of the polymer-clay 
nanocomposites.  In the past decade or so, polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites (PLSN) have 
shown an explosive growth from the perspectives of both fundamental research interests and 
industrial applications [1,2].  Incorporation of organo-clays in semicrystalline polymers, like 
nylon-6 [3-5], nylon-66 [6], syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) [7], polypropylene (PP) [8], 
poly(1-butene) (PB) [9] or poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) [10], often leads to alteration of the 
crystalline morphology through transformation in their polymorphic crystal forms.  Other 
examples, too numerous to be listed or cited all, can be found in the literature. 
Crystal polymorphism, melting, and their possible alteration by clay intercalation in 
semicrystalline polymers have been interesting topics of studies.  Recently, the multiple melting 
behavior of a terephthalic polyester, namely, poly(hexamethylene terephthalate) (PHT) have been 
analyzed in terms of two polymorphic crystalline forms α and β [11].  The origin of multiple 
endotherms has been mostly explained by two mechanistic approaches dual/multiple modification 
and reorganization [12,13].  The α cell in PHT is preferentially formed by stress-induced 
crystallization with a monoclinic chain packing, whereas β forms is characterized by a triclinic cell 
and usually found on high temperatures annealing (~140°C) of PHT [14-16].  However, a mixture 
of α and β cells is always formed at moderate temperature of crystallization (<140°C).  Till date, 
only a limited number of reports is available about the polymorphic behavior of oligomeric PHT 
and its copolymers with isophthalic acid [17], poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) [18] and 
poly(hexamethylene-2,6-naphthalate) (PHN) [19].  Nevertheless, a potential application of PHT in 
powder coating formulations has also been reported [20].   
PHT in a neat bulk form exhibits complex melting peaks and as many as five peaks were 
evident when melt crystallized at 90ºC.  An earlier paper has shed some light on the origin of 
melting peaks P1 and P3 [11] in the neat PHT.   However, correlations between the polymorphic 
morphology of two unit-cell crystals and melting peaks in PHT have yet to be further understood.  
It was proposed that clay-layer confinement on the PHT polymer chains might be used to help 
better analysis of relationships between the melting and crystalline forms.  Our previous attempts 
on PHT-clay systems have pointed a direction on verifying the relationships between the crystalline 
forms, spherulitic morphology, and relation to multiple melting peaks by studying on a set of 
PHT-clay nanocomposites containing pristine clay and different types of organo-clays [21].  The 
highly intercalated systems resulted from the fixed concentration (5-wt%) of different silicates, 
when subjected to melt-crystallization at 130ºC reveal a completely different pattern in DSC 
thermograms as compared to the neat PHT.  Incorporation of layered silicates has helped resolve 
the melting endotherm P2 and subsequent analysis of the crystalline forms and spherulitic 
morphology, which paves the way for further understanding of the micro-structural behavior of 
PHT.  In continuing work, the main objectives of this current study were to perform in-depth 
analysis on the effects of variation in the silicate concentrations on possible modifications in the 
 3
700ºC.  Wide angle X-ray instrument (WAXD) was Shimadzu XRD-6000 with Cu Kα radiation 
(30 kV and 40 mA) and a wavelength of 0.1542 nm.  The scanning 2θ angle ranged between 2° 
and 30° with a step scanning rate of 2°/min.  For direct comparisons, specimens of X-ray 
characterization were prepared using the similar thermal treatments as described for thermal 
analysis samples.  TEM images of the PLSNs (thickness of ultra-microtomed samples = 50~70 
nm) were obtained at accelerating voltage of 80 kV, using JEOL JEM 1200-EX TEM.  A 
polarized-light microscopy (PLM, Nikon Optiphot-2) equipped with a CCD camera, and a 
microscopic heating stage (Linkam THMS-600 with TP-92 temperature programmer) was used to 
investigate the spherulitic morphology of isothermally crystallized samples.  The samples were 
pressed into a thin film between two glass slides by heating to melt on the hot stage at 180°C for 10 
min and then rapidly quenched down to the designated temperature (120-140ºC). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
X-ray diffraction was performed on the following samples: C30B (clays only), PHT (neat 
polymer only), PHT/C30B (1%), PHT/C30B (3%), PHT/C30B (5%), PHT/C30B (7%), and 
PHT/C30B (10%).  The interlayer distance between silicate layers can be obtained quantitatively 
from the basal reflection of the X-ray diffraction pattern.  The diffraction patters are standard and 
not so different from those already shown in the literature [21].  Thus, for brevity, the diffraction 
spectra are not shown.  The XRD patterns show that the organo-clay (C30B) used in this study 
exhibits a distinct d001 reflection peak at a 2θ ≈ 4.8° corresponding to a basal spacing of ∼ 1.83 nm.  
The onium modifier in C30B contains hydroxyl moieties, which reduces the surface hydrophobicity 
and a significant polymer-filler interaction with PHT chains can thus be expected to affect the 
extent of dispersion of silicate layers into the PHT matrix [23].  The neat PHT shows no 
diffraction peak in the relevant region of the clay peaks (2θ = 3~8°).  The PHT/clay hybrids 
containing up to 5% by weight of C30B also reveal no significant diffraction peak in the region of 
2θ = 2.5~5°, which may indicate disordered intercalation and/or partial exfoliation of the silicate 
layers into the PHT matrix.  But, a distinct XRD peak is visible at 2θ ~ 2.1° in PHT containing 10 
wt% of C30B, revealing the presence of highly intercalated (ordered) silicate galleries (d001 ~ 4.2 
nm).  Nevertheless, the down-shifting of the original d001 peak to lower 2θ values signifies that 
nanocomposites are indeed formed for all the compositions prepared in this study.   
Since WAXD measurement is not entirely effective in distinguishing a disordered 
intercalated morphology from an exfoliated one (absence of diffraction peaks), TEM analysis is 
generally performed to complement the diffractograms of PLSNs [24].  The TEM images of 
PHT/C30B hybrids having different content of C30B are shown in Figure 1 (graphs-a, b, c), where 
the dark lines represent silicate layers.  It is evident from the micrograph that the silicate layers are 
almost completely delaminated in the PHT matrix containing 1-wt% of C30B to produce a highly 
intercalated/exfoliated structure (graph-a).  Intercalated clay tactoids with multilayer thickness of 
about 3∼5 nm are also apparent, which is not sufficiently populated to generate any XRD peak.  A 
 5
PHT/C30B nanocomposites and α/β fraction is apparently higher at lower quantity of C30B (less 
than 5 wt%).   
In our previous study, the endothermic peak P2 is reported to be associated with the β 
crystals [21].  This can be substantiated further in the present study.  It is already shown above 
that formation of β form (dendritic spherulites) is favored in the presence of layered silicate as 
compared to the neat PHT and at higher Tc (>130ºC) this crystalline form predominates over the α 
crystals.  The PHT/C30B (5%) nano-composites melt crystallized at 120ºC, exhibits a sharper 
endotherm P2 than that of neat PHT.  In neat PHT, merging of P2 with P1 at 130ºC to form P1* may 
be attributed to the large population of α type lamellae that leads to a strong and broad melting 
peak P1, which subsequently overlaps the actual P2 endotherm on dynamic heating scan.  
Furthermore, at 130ºC only a smaller fraction of β crystals with much thinner lamellae exists in 
neat PHT, which may further weaken the P2 endotherm to be obscured by strong P1 endotherm.  
Unlike those found in the neat PHT, P2 is distinctly visible as a separate endotherm in the 
nanocomposites melt crystallized at 130ºC, which contain relatively higher fraction of β phase than 
the neat PHT.  The increase in peak intensity of P2 in the nanocomposites with increase in Tc 
(120º-130ºC) indicates greater population of β cells in PHT matrix as expected.  However, the 
broader nature of P2 with the increase in Tc may imply a spherulitic morphology consists of 
crystalline lamellae with wider distribution in thickness.  Moreover, with increase in C30B content 
the intensity of P2 remains almost constant up to 3-wt% loading, but the it is enhanced on further 
loading with proportional increase of β phase in PHT matrix [compare 2θ = 21.2º (α) and 23.6º (β)].  
Thus, association of melting endotherm P2 with the β crystalline form of PHT can be justified from 
respective WAXD pattern and the morphological evidences obtained form PLM micrographs (not 
shown for brevity).   
Identification of a crystal form corresponding to the P3 endotherm is difficult since P3 
merges (at Tc ~ 125ºC) with higher melting endotherm P4 (thicker lamellae of β forms) in all the 
samples independent of the clay contents to form P4*.  However, further experiments were carried 
out to identify the crystal forms related to the melting peaks P2 and P4* by melting of some specific 
crystalline lamellae and subsequent annealing at higher temperature.  Figure 3 shows the WAXD 
patterns of the PHT/C30B (5%) nanocomposites subjected to different thermal treatments.  The 
corresponding DSC thermograms are also shown inset.  The WAXD patterns of the sample melt 
crystallized at 130ºC (for 2h) (Trace-a) and 140ºC (for 8h) (Trace-d) are completely different as 
discussed earlier.  While at 130ºC the peaks of α form are seen in conjunction with β  crystals, but 
at 140ºC only the peaks of β cells are apparent.  At 140ºC the DSC thermogram exhibits only one 
significant peak at ~ 147.8ºC indicating a single type of crystalline lamellae.  However, unlike in 
neat PHT, a faint peak (as a hump) at lower temperature (~144ºC) is also visible, which is more 
likely due to the thinner crystalline lamella associated with the melting endotherm P2.  
Nevertheless, both the melting peaks are associated with the β cells (2θ = 7.2, 15.8, 16.7, 17.9, 18.7, 
21.0, 23.6, and 27.9º) as evident from the WAXD pattern (Trace-d).  The sample melt crystallized 
at 130ºC for 2h and then dynamically heated to 140ºC at a scan rate of 10ºC/min and subsequently 
 7
temperature of 143ºC, which is very close to peak temperature of P3 (Trace a), a significant amount 
of α crystalline form may melt and recrystallized to thicker β-type lamellae and rest is probably 
reorganized thinner lamellae of β cells.  It should further be noted that the thermogram of the 
sample melt crystallized at 130ºC (Trace a) reveals a new endothermic peak designated as P2/ 
adjacent to P2 at higher temperature, which may appear due to the formation of crystalline lamella 
of different thickness by melting and recrystallization/reorganization of the original crystals 
associated with P2 during slow heating scan.  However, more detailed analysis of this newly 
formed peak is beyond the scope of the present paper.  
In summary, some worthy points may be listed.  Similar to those in neat PHT, dual 
lamellar crystalline forms α and β having complex melting patterns were evident in PHT 
nanocomposites melt-crystallized at 130ºC, where the α/β fraction was found to alter significantly 
with the C30B content.  In contrast to the neat PHT that exhibited predominantly Maltese-cross 
spherulites (α crystals), heterogeneous nucleation by the silicate layers favorably induced thicker 
and larger dendritic spherulites with β-cell packing in the PHT/C30B nanocomposites melt 
crystallized at 130ºC.   However, the abundance of α crystals in the nanocomposites containing 
lesser quantity of C30B is probably attributed to alteration in the heterogeneous nucleation 
mechanism due to restricted mobility of the PHT polymer chains under a stressed condition inside 
the confined space of silicate layer stacking of C30B.   
An additional effect by clay-exfoliation in PHT is worth mentioning and summarizing here.  
In previous studies, origin and mechanism of the melting endotherm P3 in PHT remained 
unresolved.  In this continuing investigation by using clay-exfoliation in PHT, we have further 
exemplified that the melting endotherm P3 is most likely due to the pre-existing thicker lamellae of 
α crystalline form.  Most interestingly, the clay-exfoliation in PHT allowed a clearer insight that 
the α  cell associated with the P3 melting endotherm was found to transform to a 
thermodynamically more stable β -cell upon annealing PHT at high temperatures (but still below 
the melting peak temperature of P3).

the previous findings, this study attempted to describe the crystal-form changes as a function of 
temperature after initial solvent-induced crystals were generated.  The crystalline morphologies of 
the individual PHT spherulites containing both γ- and β-forms were further characterized by 
“temperature in-situ TEM”. 
 
Experimental 
Materials  
PHT was synthesized using butyl titanate as a catalyst, according to the method described in 
the literature [24].   Molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) 
on a Waters 410 GPC system using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.  
The PHT used in this study has an Mw=13,800 g/mol and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.0.  At 
this molecular weight, its mechanical properties are slightly lower than those at higher molecular 
weights, but its thermal properties [glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), etc.] 
and crystalline morphology are expected to be characteristic of a typical polymer.  The thermal 
transition temperatures of the PHT used here may be slightly lower than those of a longer-chain 
PHT, but the characteristics of the crystals and multiple melting peaks were pretty much the same 
as those of the longer-chain PHT.  The melting point (144.3oC) and glass transition temperature 
(-6.7oC) were measured by DSC.  
 
Specimen Preparation 
Solvent-induced crystals were obtained by dissolving the synthesized PHT into chloroform to 
be a 4 wt% solution.  The solution was dried at room temperature for one day, and then the sample 
was dried in the vacuum oven at 40oC for 7 days to remove the residual solvent in PHT.   The 
solid PHT sample was directly heat-treated by DSC.   
For TEM, thin films of PHT were prepared/crystallized on glass slides by casting the solution.  
For reinforcing the specimen, the polymer thin films were coated with vapor-deposited carbon 
under vacuum.  In order to carry out the calibration of the diffraction camera length, gold (Au) was 
vapor-deposited onto some of the thin films before carbon coating.  After carbon coating, a drop (a 
hemisphere 3-4mm in diameter) of aqueous solution (25%) of polyacrylic acid was placed on the 
appropriate portion of the specimen film and hardened after drying for one day at room temperature.  
Hardened polyacrylic acid with the specimen thin film was detached from the glass plate, and then 
the polyacrylic acid was dissolved in water.  Finally, a TEM copper grid was used to collect the 
specimen film floating on the water surface and then dried under ambient condition. 
 
Analytical Apparatus  
The thermal behavior of the PHT sample was preliminarily investigated using a differential 
scanning calorimeter (DSC-7, Perkin-Elmer).  The temperature and heat of transition indicated 
with the instrument were calibrated with indium and zinc standards.  For determining the enthalpy 
of melting peaks, a dynamic heating rate of 10oC/min was used unless otherwise indicated.  
 4
then quenched to 0oC.  Finally, the DSC sample was scanned at 10oC/min from 0oC to the melt.  
Figure 2(a) shows the final thermogram.  In this thermogram, the P1 peak, which is evident in Fig. 
1(a), now has disappeared.  In addition, the total endothermic heat reduces to 57.8J/g.  Obviously, 
the endothermic heat of P1 has vanished.  By comparing Figure 2(a) with Figure 1(a), P2 and P3 
have no distinguishable difference in the amount of heat or temperature position.  WAXD was 
used to examine the diffraction intensity profile of the PHT sample after the original sample was 
heated up to 125oC.  Figure 2(b) shows the WAXD diffraction peaks of the heated sample.  The 
reflection peaks are located at 2θ=6.8, 15.7, 17.8, 21.0, 22.2, and 23.6o in this diffracgram.  
According to the earlier reports [9-11], these peaks indicate the β crystal form.  Thus, the original 
solvent-induced γ-form crystal has been transformed to a different β-form by heat-treatment on 
solvent crystallized sample of PHT to 125oC.  The result suggests that the solvent-induced γ-form 
crystal in PHT may be readily transformed to the more stable β-form at temperatures between 105 
and 125oC. 
The structure in thermally-induced phase transition was analyzed by performing WAXD on 
solvent-treated PHT samples subjected to slow heating treatment.  Figure 3 shows the WAXD 
intensity profiles of solvent-treated PHT samples that were subjected to step-increase of the 
temperature in the range of 80 to 125oC.  In the temperature range of 100 to 120oC, the 
temperature interval is reduced 2oC in order to examine the structure changes in greater details.  
The samples heated/annealed at lower temperatures below ca.106oC show characteristic γ-form 
reflection peaks.  Below 106oC, the γ-form reflection peak remains constant.   At 108oC or 
higher, the reflection peaks at 2θ=15.7, 17.8, 21.0 and 23.6o attributed to the β-form, begin to 
appear and increase in intensity on raising the annealing temperature.  On the contrary, the γ-form 
peaks at 2θ=12.1, 17.3, 18.2 and 24.9o decrease in intensity with increasing annealing temperature, 
implying that a transition from γ- to β-form occurs.   Above 120oC, the γ-form diffraction peaks 
almost vanish. 
By combining the results from DSC and X-ray, the first melting peak (P1) thus is related to 
the γ-form, while the two higher melting peaks are of the β-form.  A phase transition from γ- 
to β-form must have taken place during heat scans.  The mechanism of phase transition needs to be 
analyzed further using TEM and WAXD, in order to more accurately locate the crystal transition 
temperature. 
 In our earlier studies on sPS [3], it was found that the initially solvent-induced γ-form crystal 
of sPS can be transformed to α’-form as the temperature is increased.  At the temperature where 
the γ- to α’-phase transition takes place, the crystallinity exhibits a significant increase.  The 
increased intensity of WAXD is caused by melting of the γ-form of sPS and re-crystallization of the 
amorphous chains.   In the present case however, there is no significant change of overall intensity 
as a result of γ to β-crystal transformation.  In the DSC thermogram of the original γ-form crystal, 
there exists no exothermic peak related to re-crystallization of the melted amorphous chains.  As a 
result, the γ- to β− phase transition of PHT must take place via solid-solid phase transformation.  
Observation of morphology in the solid-solid phase transition will be evidenced by TEM in later 
 6
tabulated values for comparing SAED and WAXD results may help.   Table 1 shows the 
comparison of values of d-spacing for the γ-form crystal, which were obtained by the WAXD and 
SAED analyses.  The results indicate that values of d-spacing obtained by SAED are almost same 
as those measured by WAXD; however, the WAXD peaks at 2θ =12.1o and 15.6o are so weak that 
the corresponding reflections were not recognized in the SAED pattern.  Subsequently, the thin 
film was heated in the specimen holder to 80oC.   Fig. 7(b) is the SAED pattern obtained from the 
specimen treated at 80oC.  Overall, below 100oC, the SAED patterns were similar to the original 
sample (Fig. 7a) in agreement also with the data in Fig. 3 shown earlier.   Above 100oC, more 
dramatic changes in the crystal forms are seen.   At 110oC, the 100γ, 110γ, and 1 2 0γ reflections 
disappear in the SAED pattern, whereas 0 2 2β, 011β, 101β, and 112β appear.  At 120oC, only a 
weak 020γ reflection still exists, but it completely disappears at 125oC, leaving only four β-form 
reflections.  These β-form reflections at 125oC have d-spacings of 0.564 nm, 0.498 nm, 0.423 nm, 
and 0.377 nm, which correspond to 0 2 2β, 011β, 101β, and 112β, respectively.   Again, the bottom 
portion of Table 1 lists and compares the values of d-spacing of β-form reflections observed by 
WAXD and SAED analyses.  In addition, it is worth mentioning that experimentally all SAED 
patterns were obtained by focusing within the same one spherulite.  The result suggests that the γ- 
and β-form crystals therefore co-exist within a single spherulite in the solvent-treated PHT annealed 
in the temperature range of ca. 110~120oC. 
A temperature series (ambient to 125oC) of in-situ TEM images were produced by focusing on 
the spherulites in a same thin film specimen of solvent-induced PHT.  Various positions of the thin 
film specimen were observed in order to avoid looking at accidentally damaged spherulites.   The 
specimens were heated to higher temperatures by using the in-situ heating holder in TEM.  The 
morphological images of the spherulites were recorded in series at ambient, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 
and 125oC, respectively.  Finally, Figure 8 shows the TEM images for two specimens of the 
solvent-induced PHT at (a) ambient, and (b) 125oC.   As all the temperature series images 
(ambient, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 125oC) are similar; thus, only two representative TEM images 
are shown here.  In comparison with the as-prepared PHT sample, the spherulites heated to 
temperatures ranging from ambient to 125oC remain unchanged (for brevity, similarity in the series 
are not all shown).   Comparatively speaking, the temperature series TEM images between 
ambient and 125oC are all similar without indication of transition into liquid molten state.  As a 
result, it can be proposed that the γ- to β− phase transition of the solvent-induced PHT crystals takes 
place in the solid state without going though melting. 
 
Conclusion 
The DSC analysis on the PHT samples solvent-cast from chloroform at room temperature 
displays three endothermic peaks, indicating a crystal polymorphism and/or crystal-crystal 
transformation.  The WAXD results suggest that the initial solvent-cast PHT film is only of the 
γ-form crystal.  Upon annealing at 125oC, however, a new β-form crystal is formed, which exhibits 
two melting peaks (P2 and P3) upon DSC scanning.  The first melting peak (P1) is related to the
