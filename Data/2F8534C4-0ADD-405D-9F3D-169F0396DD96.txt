physical structure is assessed using both scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy 
(AFM). The results show that the amount of adsorbed 
proteins and attached bacteria on the modified PSf 
membranes depends not only on the surface 
hydrophilicity but also on the phase separation 
structures of PEGylated domains distributed on the 
PSf membrane surface. By controlling the surface 
uniformity of PEGylated domains, it is possible to 
highly regulate the ability of PSf membrane to resist 
the adsorption of proteins and the attachment of 
bacteria. Membranes prepared by the VIPS process 
exhibit a nano-structured phase separation. 
Therefore, they provide better anti-biofouling 
character with respect to bacterial resistance, than 
those prepared by LIPS. This work suggests that 
membrane formation by controlling PEO–PPO–PEO 
copolymer structures in nano-scale blending using the 
VIPS process shows great potential in the molecular 
design of anti-biofouling PSf or PVDF membranes for 
use in ultrafiltration or microfiltration 
applications.

英文摘要 — 
This work describes the preparation of PEGylated membranes via two different phase separation 
processes, the liquid-induced phase separation (LIPS), a very common membrane elaboration process, 
and the vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). The aim is to demonstrate that the VIPS process may 
lead to improved low-biofouling properties, compared to LIPS. Polysulfone (PSf) is taken as a model 
polymer in this report, but a similar work has been successfully performed using polyvinylidene 
fluoride (PVDF) polymer. While LIPS leads to segregated PEGylated domains, VIPS permits to 
prepare homogeneous PEGylated surfaces with dispersed domains. The chemical composition of the 
various PEGylated PSf membranes are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The physical structure is assessed 
using both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results 
show that the amount of adsorbed proteins and attached bacteria on the modified PSf membranes 
depends not only on the surface hydrophilicity but also on the phase separation structures of 
PEGylated domains distributed on the PSf membrane surface. By controlling the surface uniformity of 
PEGylated domains, it is possible to highly regulate the ability of PSf membrane to resist the 
adsorption of proteins and the attachment of bacteria. Membranes prepared by the VIPS process 
exhibit a nano-structured phase separation. Therefore, they provide better anti-biofouling character 
with respect to bacterial resistance, than those prepared by LIPS. This work suggests that membrane 
formation by controlling PEO–PPO–PEO copolymer structures in nano-scale blending using the VIPS 
process shows great potential in the molecular design of anti-biofouling PSf or PVDF membranes for 
use in ultrafiltration or microfiltration applications.

biofouling-resistant behaviors associated with 
the distributed structures of the PEGylated layer 
on the surface of PEG-blended PSf membranes 
remains unclear.  
A previous study showed that a treated 
surface with coated Pluronic® F108 triblock 
copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) –
poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) 
(PEO–PPO–PEO) was highly resistant to 
nonspecific protein adsorption under optimized 
conditions [22]. It highlighted that controlling 
the surface grafting densities of PEG chains was 
critical in order to achieve a PEGylated surface 
with low or no biofouling characteristics. 
Therefore, it is important to understand the 
effects of phase separation on the potential 
migration of the copolymers to the membrane 
surface during membrane formation, and the 
results from such studies would provide new 
physical insights into controlling of formation of 
anti-biofouling membranes with well-packed and 
nano-structured PEGylated surfaces.  
In this report, two PEGylation processes of 
PSf membranes are tested and compared with 
regard to their low-biofouling properties: these 
are the liquid-induced phase separation (LIPS) 
and the vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). 
Phase separation is applied to a physical blend of 
triblock copolymers of Pluronic F108 and PSf. 
The chemical composition, hydrophilicity, 
morphology, and structures of the surface 
PEGylated layer of PSf membranes are 
characterized by Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle and 
hydration capacity measurements, scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). Subsequently, this report 
presents the biofouling properties of the prepared 
membranes, evaluated by analyzing protein 
adsorption (Fibrinogen) and bacterial attachment 
(Escherichia Coli and Staphylococcus 
Epidermidis). This work is aimed at addressing 
two important issues for PEGylated layers 
incorporated on the PSf membrane: (i) the 
evaluation and comparison of the surface 
PEGylated qualities of PSf membranes prepared 
via two phase separation processes: LIPS, a very 
common membrane elaboration process, and 
VIPS and (ii) the investigation of the biofouling 
properties for modified PSf membranes 
associated with controlled surface coverage and 
the structures of the PEGylated layer.  
 
二、研究方法    
Materials. Polysulfone (PSf) (∼50 kDa) was 
supplied by Amoco. It was washed with 
methanol and deionized water before use. 
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-block-polypropylene 
oxide (PPO)-block-PEO triblock copolymers 
(Pluronic F108, PEO–PPO–PEO) with a Mw of 
∼15 kDa and PEO/PPO ratio of ∼80/20 were 
supplied by Asahi Electric Industry Co. Ltd. 
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), purchased from 
Tedia, was used as solvent for the LIPS and 
VIPS processes. Fibrinogen (fraction I from 
human plasma) was purchased from Sigma 
Chemical Co. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 
was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Water used 
in experiments was purified using a Millipore 
water purification system with a minimum 
resistivity of 18.0 MΩ m.  
Preparation of Membranes. The PEGylated 
PSf membranes were prepared by the LIPS or 
VIPS process from a NMP solution containing a 
fixed 20 wt% polymer powder of PSf blended 
with different ratio of PEO–PPO–PEO 
 6 
 
to 284.6 eV. A high-resolution C 1s spectrum 
was fitted using a Shirley background 
subtraction and a series of Gaussian peaks. The 
data analysis software was from Service Physics, 
Inc. The scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) 
analysis of the prepared membranes was 
performed using a Hitachi S-3000 instrument 
operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 keV. 
Prior to observation, the membranes were 
mounted on sample stages using double-sided 
adhesive tape and were sputter-coated with gold 
for 100 s. Water contact angles were measured 
with an angle-meter (Automatic Contact Angle 
Meter, Model CA-VP, Kyowa Interface Science 
Co., Ltd., Japan) at 25 ◦C. The DI water was 
dropped on the sample surface at 10 different 
sites. The surface PEGylated structure of virgin 
membranes and modified PSf membranes were 
examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). 
All the AFM images were acquired with a JPK 
Instruments AG multimode NanoWizard 
(Germany). The instrument is equipped with a 
NanoWizard scanner and operated in air. For 
tapping-mode AFM, a commercial Si cantilever 
(TESP tip) of ∼320 kHz resonant frequency 
from the JPK instrument was used. The relative 
humidity was less than 40%.  
Protein Adsorption tests. The adsorption of 
human fibrinogen (99%, purchased from 
Sigma–Aldrich) onto the membranes was 
evaluated using an Enzyme-Linked 
ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) according to a 
previously described protocol as follows. The 
membranes were placed in a 24-well plate and 
immersed for 1 h in phosphatebuffered saline 
(PBS) at 37 ◦C. The PBS was removed, and the 
membranes were soaked in 1 mL of 1 mg mL−1 
fibrinogen for 2 h at 37 ◦C. Subsequently, the 
samples were rinsed three times with PBS and 
incubated for 1 h at 37 ◦C with bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) to block the area unoccupied by 
protein. Afterward, the membranes were washed 
three times with PBS and were soaked in 1 mL 
of primary monoclonal antibody (US Biological) 
that reacted with fibrinogen for 30 min at 37 ◦C. 
The membranes were again washed three times 
with PBS and blocked with BSA for 1 h at 37 ◦C. 
Subsequently, the membranes were rinsed three 
times with PBS, and 1 mL of 1 mg mL−1 
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
monoclonal antibody was added to each well. 
Following this step, membranes were washed 5 
times with PBS and transferred into clean wells 
before incubation in 500 µL of 1 mg mL−1 of 
3,3’,5,5’- tetramethylbenzidine chromogen 0.05 
wt% Tween 20, and 0.05 wt% hydrogen 
peroxide, for 5 min at 37 ◦C. Five hundred 
microliters of sulfuric acid were added to stop 
the enzymatic color reaction, and the absorbance 
at 450 nm was measured using a UV–Vis 
spectrophotometer (PowerWave XS, Biotech). 
Each test was performed three times on each 
membrane. 
Bacterial attachment tests. Two bacterial 
species, Staphylococcus epidermidis and 
Escherichia coli, were used to investigate 
bacterial adhesion behavior on the surface of 
PEGylated PSf membranes. S. epidermidis and E. 
coli were cultured in a medium containing 3.0 
mg/ml beef extract with 5.0 mg/ml peptone. 
These cultures were incubated at 37 ◦C and 
shaken at 100 rpm until the stationary phase was 
reached. For S. epidermidis, the final 
concentration was 109 cells/ml after 15 h of 
incubation and for E. coli, the final concentration 
was 106 cells/ml after 12 h. The hydrogel disks 
were incubated with 75 wt% ethanol for 1 h at 25 
◦C and washed 3 times with PBS in a 24-well 
 8 
 
groups of the PPO segments corresponding to 
the C–H stretch at 2978 cm−1, and this segment 
is clearly present on the PEGylated PSf 
membranes. The 1587 and 1489 cm−1 bands 
were assigned to the aromatic groups (C-C 
stretching vibration), while the 1418 and 1364 
cm−1 bands corresponded to methyl group 
signals. The 1325 cm−1/1296 cm−1 doublet and 
the 1151 cm−1 band were caused by the aromatic 
asymmetric sulfone chromophore and the 
aromatic symmetric sulfone chromophore, 
respectively. The intensity of the C–H stretching 
at 2873 cm−1 increased significantly as the 
blending content of Pluronic® F108 increased, 
evidencing a better surface coverage for higher 
additive contents. This also indicates that the 
distribution of the blended PEO–PPO–PEO 
copolymer is dependent on the control of the 
additive blending amount during the phase 
separation. A similar result was reported in 
previous studies on the preparation of cellulose 
acetate/Pluronic® F127 membranes [36]. In 
addition, one should note that the intensity of the 
C–H stretches of the PEGylated PSf membranes 
prepared by LIPS is higher than that prepared by 
VIPS indicating that the precipitated or 
aggregated PEO–PPO–PEO domains in PSf 
membranes using liquid-induced PEGylation 
might be larger than those formed using 
vapor-induced phase separation process.  
In this study, the chemical structures of the 
PEGylated layer on the PSf membrane surface 
was also identified performing an XPS analysis. 
Fig. 3 shows the typical XPS spectrum of the 
virgin PSf membrane and the PEGylated PSf 
membranes. The C 1s core-level spectrum of the 
membranes was curve-fitted with peak 
components for the [C–O] and [C–C, C–H] 
species at binding energies of approximately 
286.5 and 284.6 eV, respectively. The results for 
the PEGylated layer on the PSf membranes are 
summarized in Table 2 and 3. The XPS analysis 
of the elemental composition of the PSf 
membrane blended with PEO–PPO–PEO 
copolymers demonstrated that the [C–O] peak is 
a major indicator for the chemical structure of 
PEO or PPO blocks distributed on the membrane 
surfaces. Regardless of whether the LIPS or 
VIPS process was used, the [C–O] proportion of 
the prepared membranes increased as the 
blending content of Pluronic F108 increased 
from 1 to 5 wt% in the casting solution, which 
indicates that the PEO–PPO–PEO copolymers 
remained at the surface of both types of PSf 
membranes. 
   
Morphology of PEGylated PSf membranes. 
The morphology of the PEGylated membranes is 
associated with the membrane formation 
processes and the chain conformations of 
blended PEO–PPO–PEO copolymers into the 
PSf membrane, as observed by SEM. In Fig. 4, 
the surface morphology, top skin layer, and 
cross-sectional structure of the PEGylated PSf 
membranes revealed an obvious change between 
the LIPS and VIPS phase separation processes. 
The surface morphologies of the membranes 
prepared by the LIPS process (Fig. 4(a)–(d)) 
were smooth and flat, while their cross-sectional 
images exhibited typical fingerlike structures 
(Fig. 4(e)–(h)). The results indicated that 
accelerated demixing in the LIPS process tends 
to produce PEGylated PSf membranes with a 
thick and dense top layer. As shown in Fig. 
4(i)–(l), the membranes prepared using the VIPS 
process presented nodules on top. These nodules 
were irregular, with respect to both their shape 
and size range (10–20 µm). A previous study 
 10 
 
membrane surfaces approach their respective 
saturated coverages with a steady water contact 
angle. Thus, it is possible that a similar reduction 
of the water contact angle for the membranes 
obtained from the LIPS and VIPS processes 
might result in a similar level of protein 
resistance on the prepared membrane surfaces. 
Interestingly, the reduction in nonspecific 
fibrinogen adsorption exhibited a positive 
correlation with the surface hydrophilicity of the 
PEGylated membranes prepared using the VIPS 
process (Fig. 6). The relative protein adsorption 
on V-P15-F5 was effectively reduced to 30% of 
the limitation of virgin PSf membranes as the 
blending content of Pluronic F108 increased to 5 
wt%. However, the relative protein adsorption on 
L-P15-F5 was only reduced to 80% of the 
limitation of virgin PSf membranes, even as the 
water contact angle was reduced to 60◦. These 
results may be related to the different types of 
blending structures of the PEGylated layer 
prepared using LIPS or VIPS.  
The hydration capacity is a measurement of 
the following: (1) trapping water molecules 
within the PSf polymeric chains, (2) binding 
water molecules around the ethylene glycol 
structure of the PEGylated brushes, and (3) 
captured water molecules in the confined spaces 
between PEGylated chains or segregated 
domains. The results displayed in Fig. 5 show 
that the hydration capacity of the virgin PSf 
membranes (L-P20-F0 and V-P20-F0) was only 
approximately 0.25 mg/cm2. Therefore, some 
water molecules are entrapped within the porous 
structures. This result also indicates that the 
measured quantity of the hydration capacity 
contributed by trapping water molecules does not 
strongly depend on the porous structures of the 
prepared PSf membranes, and so, on the 
preparation method used. The increase of 
Pluronic® F108 content in the blend associated 
with the increase in the amount of the PEGylated 
layer on the PSf membrane surface resulted in an 
increased hydration capacity, which is dependent 
on the contribution of bound and captured water 
molecules. The formation of the bound water 
layer on a highly hydrated surface is considered 
crucial to repel plasma proteins and generate the 
anti-biofouling surface [22,24,40]. In general, 
the surface structure of the PEGylated polymer is 
associated with the hydration capacity of water 
molecules on the hydrated surface. Fig. 6 shows 
that the hydration capacity of V-P15-F5 was 
higher than that of L-P15-F5 with the same 
blending content of Pluronic F108 (5 wt%), 
indicating that the reduction in nonspecific 
fibrinogen adsorption is positively correlated 
with the variation in the hydration capacity of 
PEGylated PSf membranes. It is possible that the 
retained portion of the bound water molecules 
around the PEGylated brushes on the membrane 
surface of V-P15-F5 was greater than that of 
L-P15-F5, as supported by Figs. 7 and 8.  
The composition analysis of the PEGylated 
layer displayed in Fig. 7 showed that the 
[C–O]/[C–C, C–H] ratio of the membranes 
prepared using LIPS increased from 0.19 to 0.58, 
while that of the membranes prepared using 
VIPS increased from 0.26 to 0.71 as the blending 
content of Pluronic F108 increased from 1 to 5 
wt%. This result highlights that the [C–O]/[C–C, 
C–H] content remained higher on the surface of 
PEGylated membranes prepared using the VIPS 
process than those prepared using the LIPS 
process. It may arise from the migration of the 
copolymers to the surface in the VIPS process 
that would be more significant than that in the 
LIPS process. Because phase separation kinetic

membranes. The results evidence a correlation 
between the attachment of S. epidermidis and the 
adsorption of proteins, potentially owed to the 
protein content on the outer cell membrane of 
bacteria. The surface coverage of the PEGylated 
layer on a PSf membrane could control 
attachment of Gram-positive bacteria. This study 
showed that the VIPS process can produce an 
anti-biofouling membrane system with 
controllable surface coverage and a 
well-distributed PEGylated layer for the 
improved resistance of protein adsorption and 
bacterial attachment. 
 
四、研究結論  
In this study, we reported the formation of 
low-biofouling PSf membranes with 
controllable surface coverage of blended 
hydrophobic–hydrophilic PEO–PPO–PEO 
copolymers (Pluronic F108) via vapor-induced 
phase separation process VIPS. Membranes 
were also prepared by liquid-induced phase 
separation in order to compare the efficiency of 
processes to obtain a low-biofouling surface. 
Necessarily, two different membrane structures - 
finger-like and cellular-like porous PSf 
membranes - were observed by LIPS and VIPS, 
respectively. We demonstrated that PEGylation 
of the PSf membrane surface using the VIPS 
process was a promising approach for the 
preparation of a membrane with uniform 
distribution and a high coverage of PEGylated 
structures; however, our observations suggested 
that the LIPS process did not show the same 
potential. The selection of results presented in 
this report clearly show that membranes 
prepared using VIPS can lead to anti-biofouling 
properties. On the contrary, for similar 
formulation conditions, the more commonly 
used LIPS process does not permit to achieve a 
significant decreasing of biofouling. 
Furthermore, the PSf membrane blended with 
well-dispersed PEGylated domains showed an 
excellent resistance to protein adsorption and 
bacterial attachment, attributed to the formation 
of a strong interfacial hydration layer around the 
PEO segments. The results also support the 
hypothesis that the attachment of bacteria is 
highly correlated with the adsorption of proteins 
on membrane surfaces, This study suggests that 
controlling membrane PEGylation with Pluronic 
F108 using the VIPS process produces 
PEGylated PSf membranes that show potential 
for the preparation of anti-biofouling 
membranes for use with protein- and 
bacterial-containing media.  
Owing to the low-biofouling properties obtained 
by preparing PSf membranes using the VIPS 
process, a similar study was performed using 
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer. PVDF 
membranes are extensively used in membrane 
technology and their biofouling is also a major 
issue. Our second study demonstrated the 
improvement of protein and bacteria resistance 
by using Pluronic® F108 in the initial solution 
and applying the VIPS process and results were 
also published. 
If the addition of PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer in 
the formulation permits to improve the 
low-biofouling properties of membranes, not 
much knowledge is available on the 
understanding of membrane formation from a 
polymer/additive polymer/solvent ternary 
system. The role of the polymer on the physical 
properties of the membranes remains unclear, 
for instance. Therefore, studies concerning the 
establishment of pseudo-ternary diagrams as 
well as detailed morphological characterizations
