Abstract 
Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is an important technique through noninvasive method and plays an 
important role in clinical medicine application. Also, the advantage of MRI has good recognition ability for 
soft tissues. It can help the diagnosis and surgical technique in clinical application. Previous studies exhibited 
the importance of brain tissue segmentation and three-dimension (3D) reconstruction in Magnetic resonance 
(MR) images. Improving the brain tissue segmentation and 3D-reconstruction of brain structure are important 
issues in MR image processing. The purpose of this proposal is to obtain MRI clinical image, to segment 
brain tissue, and to reconstruct 3D images from segmented images in MRI images. For the importance of 
brain tissue segmentation in neuroimage clinical application, the analysis methods are very important. There 
are three methods to be used in this proposal. First, the decision tree will be constructed to segment the brain 
tissues of MR images. Next, the fuzzy logic inference decision tree will be used to segment the brain tissues 
of MRI images. Finally, the 3D images of brain tissue will be reconstructed from the segmented images to 
compare the resultant images of different segmentation algorithm and different subjects to extract the 
effective medical informatics. The tissue segmentation and 3D reconstruction are very helpful for surgical 
application and diagnosis. The aim of this research are to support effective medical informatics through the 
two segmentation way and a 3D reconstruction algorithm from MRI images in clinical application.

1. Introduction 
Magnetic resonance (MR) image segmentation is an important image post-processing for medical research 
and clinical diagnoses. Brain MR image segmentation is critical to the assessment of brain tissues and 
neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and tumors (Rettmann et al., 2002; Anbeek et al., 2004; 
Zoroofi et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Mohr et al., 2004; Admiraal-Behlul et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2005; Dou et 
al., 2007; Behrens et al., 2007; Xia et al., 2007). Zoroofi et al. (2004) demonstrated favorable segmentation 
performance using an automatic segmentation technique combined with region growing, gray morphological 
dilation, filtering, and thresholding to assess the necrotic formal head area. Admiraal-Behlul et al. (2005) used 
a fully automatic segmentation method combined with adaptive and reasoning levels to perform white matter 
hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation for volume qualification and similarity on older MR images. Dou et al. 
(2007) proposed a framework of fuzzy information fusion combined with registration operation, feature 
extraction, fuzzy feature fusion operation, and fuzzy region growing to automatically segment brain tumor 
tissues on MR images. Xia et al. (2007) proposed a knowledge-driven algorithm for automatically delineating 
the caudate nucleus (CN) region in MR-imaged human brains. These studies demonstrate the importance of 
segmentation for neurological applications. In basic segmentation applications, conventional MR image 
segmentation is used to detect regions of growth and edges (Cline et al., 1987; Joliot et al., 1993; Schiemann 
et al., 1996). In the brain, MR image tissue segmentation is important to accurately distinguish gray matter 
(GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) (Zhou et al., 2001; Andersen et al., 2002; 
Marroquin et al., 2002; Amato et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2005), while automatic MR image segmentation is often 
used to classify brain tissue. Many automatic segmentation techniques use probabilistic classification to 
segment brain tissue (Andersen et al., 2002; Anbeek et al., 2005; Greenspan et al., 2006), while others use 
wavelet coefficients as spatial features of voxels in three-dimensional (3D) imaging for clustering the GM, 
WM, and CSF with fuzzy theory. Fuzzy logical models have been used to test phantom, normal, and 
Alzheimer’s brain MR images in order to reduce the difference of partial volume averaging on the boundary 
of the ventricles (Barra et al., 2000). Another wavelet application has been used to design attribute vectors as 
spatial features of voxels for determining correspondence in 3D brain MR images (Xue et al., 2004). 
Segmentation applications include tissue volume quantification and 3D spatial structure reconstruction, which 
greatly aid in disease diagnosis (Joliot and Majoyer, 1993; Tang et al., 2000; Yoo et al., 2001; Zoroofi et al., 
2001; Archibald et al., 2003; Mohr et al., 2004; Zoroofi et al., 2004; Ali et al., 2005; Andrey and Maurin, 
2005; He et al., 2005; Shan et al., 2005; Noulhiane et al., 2006). 
Several factors make brain MR image segmentation difficult, including similar imaging intensities in 
 
 
Euclidean coordinates (x, y) or polar coordinates (r, ) by image preprocessing. Noise and RF heterogeneities 
often reduced the quality of MR images, such that their impact on segmentation accuracy needed to be 
reduced by image manipulation. 
The general gray level represents the intensity of each pixel for MR image segmentation. The use of more 
spatial features in an image is considered to improve the accuracy of image segmentation. The spatial gray (S) 
level is given as 
1
( , ) ( , )
n
i i
i
S x y g x y

 ,                                 (1) 
which is the sum of combined weighting i  and gray level ( , )ig x y  of pixel i  on the neighboring area. 
The neighboring area is shown in Figure 1(a), which depicts the five neighbor systems used in this study, 
wherein the gray level weighting at the center pixel with the nearest four pixels produced n = 5 and 1
5i
  . 
The wavelet transform (W) of the spatial features used in this study was the coefficient of the wavelet 
transform transferred from nine gray levels of each local area to represent the wavelet spatial features of the 
center pixel for every location. Local areas were generated from every nine pixels in each MR image, as 
shown in Figure 1(b).

2.3. Segmentation 
A decision tree combined with boost trials and a fuzzy threshold was used in this study. This method was 
shown by Quinlan to model the prediction tree using a statistical analysis that considered outcome variables to 
make an accurate prediction (Quinlan et al., 2003). A standard image was trained using the boosted decision 
tree with a fuzzy threshold, while images with noise levels and RF heterogeneities were then tested by the 
decision tree constructed from the trained structures. The operation is described as follows. 
2.3.1. Decision Tree Classification 
The decision tree builds a classifier form that can be integrated using boosting and a fuzzy threshold 
(Quinlan, 1993; Quinlan , 2003; Dombi and Zsiros, 2005). Regions and tissues in the SPMR images were 
divided into three and four classes of the decision tree, respectively. A schematic diagram of the decision tree 
structure is shown in Figure 2. A decision tree is a tree structure that grows from a root node, flows outward 
toward internal nodes, and terminates at leaf nodes. The leaf nodes represent the class, wherein the classifier is 
a model derived from the training dataset and is applied to predict class values in a test dataset. In the tree 
structure, each internal node is divided by a condition related to a feature, and each branch denotes the 
outcome of attribute splitting. Each node (root node and internal node) is split into two or more branch nodes. 
Examples of splitting conditions include “A>a,” “B>b,” or “C>c” for each node in every attribute, as shown 
in Figure 2. Branch splitting is determined by the condition of each node. The leaf nodes depict classification 
by these splitting conditions, and the class is labeled on the leaf node. The decision tree structure can be 
transferred into a set of rules. 
2.3.2. Decision Tree Construction with Gain Ratio 
The proposed decision tree is constructed from a data set S  by the training criteria, Gain Ratio, which is a 
measure of incorporated entropy (Quinlan, 1993; Frey and Fisher, 2003; Ranilla et al., 2003; Dombi and 
Zsiros, 2005; Hu et al., 2007). The procedures of Gain Ratio are defined as follows. For simulated MR data, 
assume that a training data set S consists of C  class examples. The function ( , )p S r  is the ratio for the 
class number of an MR data set belonging to class r  of the total class number S  of an MR data set S , 
where 1 r C  . Suppose that T  is a feature whose total partitions are v . The value i  is any specific 
value of v , while iS  is a subset of the MR data set S  corresponding to the value i  of T . The 
 
 
denominator represents the area of voxels in class k  in the standard image. 
 The k index (also called the Dice coefficient) as given in Equation (3), which is another means of 
segmentation evaluation, was also used to quantify the performance of segmentation.  The k index is 
ordinarily used to measure the similarity of two images (Dice, 1945; Marroquin et al., 2002; Archibald et al., 
2003; Anbeek et al., 2004; Anbeek et al., 2005; Greenspan et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2007). Given two images, 
1S  denotes all tissues of the standard reference image, while 2S  denotes all tissues of the segmented image. 
The k index is defined as: 
1 2
1 2
1 2
2
( , )
S S
k S S
S S
  ,                               (3) 
where 1 2S S  denotes the intersection area between 1S  and 2S . The k index, running from 0 to 1, was 
applied to compare the segmented image and standard image (manually labeled by an expert).

Figure 3. Accuracy rates of tissue segmentation using a boosted decision tree algorithm on simulated brain 
MR images. (a) Accuracy rates of GM segmentation using spatial feature (G x, y, r, ). (b) Accuracy rates of 
WM segmentation using spatial feature (G x, y, r, ). (c) Accuracy rates of CSF segmentation with spatial

rates of WM segmentation using spatial feature (S x, y, r, ). (f) Accuracy rates of CSF segmentation using 
spatial feature (S x, y, r, ). 
 
SBMR images with different noise and heterogeneity levels were segmented using the boosted decision tree 
algorithm with spatial features (G, x, y), (S, x, y), (G, x, y, r, ), (S, x, y, r, ), (W, x, y, G, r, ), and (W, x, y, G, r, 
S). Image segmentation decision tree performance was best using spatial features (G, x, y, r, ) and (S, x, y, r, 
) in SBMR images. Figure 3(a) depicts the average segmentation accuracy using spatial feature (G, x, y, r, ) 
in SBMR images with noise and heterogeneity levels of T1n7, T1n7RF20, and T1n7RF40. Figure 3(b) depicts 
the average segmentation accuracy with spatial feature (S, x, y, r, ) in SBMR images with noise and 
heterogeneity levels of T1n7, T1n7RF20, and T1n7RF40. Critical average accuracy rates were obtained using 
a decision tree with a boost trial number of 20. Greater boost trials resulted in a longer processing time. 
Therefore, the decision tree with 20 boost trials was selected to segment all simulated brain MR images, as 
shown in Figure 3. Row 1 in Figure 4 depicts a standard image (manually labeled by an expert). The images 
in column 1 of Figure 4 show the original simulated brain MR images using T1n7, T1n7RF20, and T1n7RF40. 
 
 
from subject B using the boosted decision tree with (G, x, y, r, ), (S, x, y, r, ), (W, x, y, G, r, ), and (W, x, y, G, 
r, S) were higher than 0.9967, 0.9987, and 0.9922, respectively. The k indices of segmented GM, WM, and 
CSF from subject B using the boosted decision tree with (G, x, y, r, ), (S, x, y, r, ), (W, x, y, G, r, ), and (W, x, 
y, G, r, S) were higher than 0.9963, 0.9984, and 0.9942, respectively. The accuracy rates and k indices of 
segmented GM, WM, and CSF from subject B using SRG were higher than 0.6635, 0.9085, and 0.1579, 
respectively. The k indices of segmented GM, WM, and CSF from subject B using SRG were higher than 
0.6195, 0.8400, and 0.2725, respectively. The accuracy rates and k indices of segmented GM, WM, and CSF 
using the boosted decision tree with (G, x, y, r, ), (S, x, y, r, ), (W, x, y, G, r, ), and (W, x, y, G, r, S) 
exhibited much higher performance than those using the SRG segmentation algorithm.  
Figure 6 depicts segmented images using the boosted decision tree and the other segmentation algorithm. 
Images in rows 1 and 2 of Figure 6 were obtained from subjects A and B. Images in column 1 of Figure 6 
show the original MR images from subjects A and B. Images in column 2 of Figure 6 show images 
corresponding to column 1 that were segmented using the boosted decision tree with spatial features (G, x, y, r, 
). Images in column 3 of Figure 6 show images segmented with the other segmentation algorithm. Clear 
tissue regions were identified from real segmented brain image data using the boosted decision tree, whereas 
unclear regions and artifacts existed in the original images and those segmented with the SRG algorithm. It is, 
therefore, clear that visually apparent artifacts in MR images of real brains are reduced when using the 
boosted decision tree. 
        
Figure 6. Segmentation of real brain MR imaging data. Images in column 1 show the original brain MR 
images of subjects A and B. Images in column 2 correspond to those in column 1 and were segmented using 
the boost decision tree with spatial feature (G, x, y, r, ). Images in column 3 correspond to those in column 1 
and were segmented with the SRG algorithm. Images in column 4 correspond to those in column 1 and were 
segmented with the AS algorithm. 
4. Discussion 
    The intensity distribution of each tissue in the SBMR images overlapped more and was more complex 
than in the simulated phantom images. The increased noise levels or RF heterogeneities of SBMR images 
often cause greater image intensity distribution overlap. The SBMR images were more difficult to correctly 
segment, and as such, the boosted decision tree was proposed. The accuracy rates of SBMR tissue 
segmentation increased when the boost trial numbers were increased, but at the expense of a longer process, 
as depicted in Figure 3. In order to limit time consumption, we elected to use 20 boost trial numbers in the 
decision tree algorithm to improve the accuracy of SBMR image tissue segmentation. The accuracy rates of 
segmented brain tissues using spatial feature (G, x, y, r, ) were higher than those using spatial feature (S, x, y, 
r, ) since the general gray level (G) had less overlap in the intensity distribution for each tissue compared to 
the spatial gray level (S). The local area of spatial feature (S) was also larger than that of spatial feature (G), as 
shown in Figure 1. Thus, the segmentation accuracy rates were lowest when the spatial features included 
wavelet transform (W). The segmentation accuracy rates using the boosted decision tree algorithm with spatial 
features (G, x, y, r, ) and (S, x, y, r, ) decreased when the noise levels in brain MR images increased (Fig. 6). 
The accuracy rates also decreased when the noise levels increased in conjunction with 20% or 40% RF 
heterogeneities. There was no significant difference in accuracy between SBMR images with 20% or 40% 
heterogeneity since the overlap in the intensity distribution was less affected by heterogeneities. The decrease 
in accuracy caused by increased noise was greater than that caused by heterogeneities. More complicated 
statistical analyses or parameter adjustments are often implemented to further enhance accuracy. Several 
studies have examined the accuracy of MR segmentation (Marroquin et al., 2002; Archibald et al., 2003; 
Anbeek et al., 2005; Greenspan et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006). Marroquin et al. (2002) studied automatic 
segmentation of brain MR images. Their validation was only performed on GM and WM. Archibald et al.
