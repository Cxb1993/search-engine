the relation between the output and the disturbance) must 
be minimum phase. If one of the two conditions 
mentioned above is not satisfied, there exists no method to 
be found to design a stable UIO. As proposed by Jin et al. 
[22], it was demonstrated that the matching condition can 
be relaxed by allowing delays of the system output in the 
observer, but no design method was provided. Sundaram 
and Hadjicostis [23] extended this method and proposed a 
streamlined design procedure. Of considerable 
significance, Floquet and Barbot [24] used an output 
canonical transformation to design an UIO with the 
matching condition being invalid.  
In this paper, a design technique using DSMC by 
employing output information only for a class of MIMO 
systems with mismatched disturbance is proposed. First, 
we introduce the integral term of the estimation output 
error in the observer design to propose certain degrees of 
freedom. Using this technique and assuming that the 
disturbance does not vary too much in between two 
consecutive sampling instances, we shall demonstrate that 
the proposed algorithm in digital implementations can not 
only reduce the state estimation errors but also restrict the 
disturbance estimation errors to be smaller than a size of 
( )O T  where T is the sampling interval. Hence, the 
conventionally-assumed upper bound restriction on the 
disturbance is relaxed to the restriction of the rate of the 
disturbance, of which it is considerably slower than the 
sampling rate. In a like manner, using the estimation state 
and the estimation disturbance, the control law is then 
designed and the closed-loop stability is analyzed. 
Together, some significant features are discussed 
including the selection of the sliding surface, the 
performance of estimation disturbance and the 
convergence rate to sliding mode.  
This paper is organized as follows. The system 
description and the problem formulation are given in 
Section 2. Section 3 presents the state estimator and the 
disturbance observer. In Section 4, the sliding surface 
design that can effectively reduce the influence of 
mismatched disturbance during sliding motion is 
demonstrated. In Section 5, we develop the controller 
algorithm using the estimation state and disturbance to 
stabilize the system with system stability analysis being 
demonstrated. Section 6 gives a numerical example to 
exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed controller. 
Finally, Section 7 presents the concluding remarks. 
II. PROBLEM FOMULATION 
Consider a continuous-time MIMO linear system with 
mismatched disturbance described by

where n∈x \  is the system state, m∈u \  is the control 
input, l∈d \  is mismatched disturbance, and m∈y \  is 
the measurable output of the system. For system (1), the 
system matrices have appropriate dimensions and the 
matrix G is of full rank. Suppose that the sampling 
interval is T and a zero-order-hold is adopted for the 
above-mentioned continuous-time model. Denoting 
( ) ( )k kT=x x , ( ) ( )k kT=y y , and ( ) ( )k kT=u u  where 
0k ≥  is an integer, the discrete-time model can be then 
given by

where n is an integer and we denote ( ) ( )0 1O T O= . In 
this paper, a state and unknown disturbance estimation 
algorithm developed for system (2) was first proposed in 
Section 3. When the sampling period is small enough and 
the disturbance is smooth enough, the proposed design 
method can constrain the estimation error to be on the 
order of ( )O T . Using the estimation information, the 
discrete-time sliding mode controller, which can track the 
desired signal with the tracking error being constrained in 
a small region on the order of ( )O T , is then designed in 
Section 5. Before introducing the main results, the 
following four assumptions are made throughout this 
paper. 
Assumption 1: System (2) is controllable and observable. 
Assumption 2: These matrices A, G and C can satisfy 
nrank n l
⎛ ⎞−⎡ ⎤ = +⎜ ⎟⎢ ⎥⎜ ⎟⎣ ⎦⎝ ⎠
A I G
C 0
 
The assumption follows that the dimension of disturbance 
is smaller than the dimension of output. 
Assumption 3: The matrices A, B and C satisfy 
nrank n m
⎛ ⎞−⎡ ⎤ = +⎜ ⎟⎢ ⎥⎜ ⎟⎣ ⎦⎝ ⎠
A I B
C 0
 and ( )rank m=CB . 
This condition implies that system (2) has no 
transmission zeros at one. 
Assumption 4 [8-10]: The sampling interval T is 
sufficiently small such that the disturbance does not vary 
too much between two consecutive sampling instances. 
Moreover, the following relations can be effectively 
approximated as 
be used to decide the gain matrix L. Another alternative 
method is given by 
 ( ) 1T Te e e e e e e −= +L A P C R C P C  (14) 
where ( ) ( ) 0n l n le + × +∈ >P \  is obtained from the following 
discrete algebraic Riccati equation 
( ) 1T T T Te e e e e e e e e e e e e e e−+ + − =P A P C C P C R C P A A P A Q  (15) 
where ( ) ( ) 0n l n le + × +∈ >Q \  and 0m me ×∈ >R \ . We know 
that the matrix e e−A LC  can be decomposed as 
 1e e
−− =A LC MJM  (16) 
where J is the Jordan matrix of the eigenvalues of 
e e−A LC  and M is the corresponding eigenvector matrix. 
Then the solution of (13) is

Theorem 1: Consider the dynamic system (1) and its 
corresponding discrete-time model can be described by 
(2). If the state and disturbance observers are designed as

Since a matrix L from Lemma 1 should be found such

obtained:

(2) ( )

Proof: Since the matrix e e−A LC  is stable, it follows

follows that 
(1) ( )2lim ( )k k O T→∞ ≤x  
(2) ( )

lim ( )fk k O T→∞ ≤e  
The proof of this theorem is completed.   
Remark 1: As can be seen from the above-mentioned 
analysis, if the disturbance is smooth enough and if T is 
small enough, the proposed observer method can be used 
to accurately perform the operation with well estimation. 
This assumption, which indicates the insignificant 
variation of the disturbance between the two sampling 
points, points out the fact that the unknown input 
bandwidth is far smaller than the control bandwidth.  
Remark 2: In response to a system incapable of 
satisfying the matching condition, the matrix e e−A LC  is 
stable and then our proposed algorithm can obtain a 
stable estimator as long as Assumption 2 is valid. In 
comparison with the traditional UIO design methods [21-
24], the algorithm we propose is capable of not only 
dealing with an unsatisfied matching condition system 
but also being implemented in specific nonminimum 
phase systems. 
Remark 3: In these papers [17-18], a constant disturbance 
model has been introduced into system (2). From (4) and 
(5), the augmented system model is then given by

Based on the above system to design the observers of the

It follows from Theorem 1 and the above equation that our

IV. COMMAND GENERATOR TRACKER 
Command generator tracker is used to construct a 
paradigm developed for the purpose of establishing the 
desired reference model. Broussard and O’Brien [29] 
proposed the command generator tracker methodology 
and this method was originally developed for continuous-
time flight control. Basically, the fundamental model of 
command generator is a linear system excited by a 
constant input. The most unique feature of this method is 
that there do not exist any restrictions of imposing the 
order of the model to be the same as the plant; thus, the 
conventional perfect model following constraint can be 
replaced. When the dimension of the system is increased, 
the command generator tracker method can be utilized in 
improving the calculation time quite significantly. 
Let the reference output my  be generated by the

that the system is finally restricted in the region

Hence, the system trajectory first gets into the attraction 
region within finite steps and finally stays in the sliding 
region.  
Finally, we shall analyze the system stability when the 
system stays in the sliding region. From (33) and (34), the

in Figure 2. In spite of the fact that the system does not 
satisfy the matching condition, the system state is well 
estimated. Hence, the estimation method we propose can 
still be functioning normally to obtain valid estimation 
under the disturbance is smooth enough. The response of 
( )s k  shown in Figure 3 can reach and enter in the first 
layer ( ) 1s k <  and then it is constrained in the second 
layer. Figure 4 shows the control input response. And 
trajectories of the system output ( )y k  and the reference 
( )my k  are given in Figure 5. Based on these figures, 
although the system is in the presence of unknown 
disturbance, the system performance is excellent using 
the proposed algorithm. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
An algorithm of utilizing output feedback method in 
performing sliding mode controller design is proposed in 
regard to a MIMO discrete-time system with mismatched 
disturbance. At first, an observer design method with 
estimating both the system state and disturbance 
simultaneously is presented. Although the perfect 
estimation is not achievable, when the disturbance in 
between the two consecutive sampling points is not 
changed significantly, our proposed algorithm is able to 
render the estimation error to be restricted within ( )O T . 
Moreover, our proposed estimator method should be 
implemented in some nonminimum phase systems. The 
command generator tracker technique is then used to 
establish the reference model. Due to the fact that the 
estimated system state and disturbance are to have been 
implemented in the controller, the closed-loop stability is 
guaranteed and the tracking error is to be constrained in a 
small region. Finally, our control law is feasible arising 
from the simulation results.
