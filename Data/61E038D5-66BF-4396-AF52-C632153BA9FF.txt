I. Introduction 
The design procedures and implementation technologies for wide band planar filter applications have been studied for years [1]. 
Among them, multiple-mode resonators were adopted to relax the implementation limitation of coupled-line input and output 
sections. It is observed that the characteristics of these filters can be explained by classic commensurate-line filter synthesis. 
Procedures based on Matthaei’s approximate method [2] had been proposed to design wide-band dual-mode and triple-mode 
stepped-impedance resonator filters [3]. If all connecting unit elements (UEs) contribute to the order of the multi-mode resonator 
filter, the filter is a non-redundant design. 
To improve skirt rejection or harmonic suppression, the stub-loaded multiple-mode resonator structures have also been suggested 
[4]-[6]. These filters are successfully designed by computer simulation and optimization of various parameters. However, exact 
synthesis has never been demonstrated. This means that the bandwidth, passband return loss, and selectivity of these filters are not 
predictable. It is the purpose of this research to show that filters based on similar structures can be exact synthesized, starting with 
these filter specifications. As an example, a filter structure based on bandpass prototype in Richards’ domain (S-plane) is proposed 
as shown in Fig. 1. The resonant modes of this structure are analyzed in the next section to demonstrate its multi-mode 
characteristics. It is then followed by the derivation of driving point impedance using transformed variable Z and network synthesis 
in the S-plane. 
II. Multi-Mode Structure Analysis 
The structure shown in Fig. 1 are used as an example to summarize this study, which consists of totally seven / 4o transmission-line 
sections, with their characteristic impedance denoted as 1Z , 2Z , 3Z , and 4Z , respectively. The commensurate frequency is chosen 
to be 3.3of   GHz for the following analysis.  
Without the open-circuited and short-circuited stubs, the four cascaded transmission-line sections become a full-wavelength 
resonator if they are not (heavily) loaded by the input and output impedance 0Z . For a uniform line (e.g. 1 2 0 50Z Z Z    ), it 
will resonant at 0.5 of , of , 1.5 of , ..., as shown in Fig 2(a). If 2Z  is decreased (e.g. 1 0Z Z and 2 00.2Z Z ), the first three 
resonant frequencies will move toward each other as shown in Fig. 2(b). Then it becomes a multi-mode resonator.  
The loaded stubs in Fig. 1 can be analyzed as follows. The two open-circuited stubs on two sides can be transformed to the center as 
one open-circuited stub by using Kuroda’s identities. This open-circuited stub is in parallel with the short-circuited stub. They can

A bandpass prototype with six elements will yield third-order bandpass filter characteristics in the f-plane. It has a third-order 
response below the commensurate frequency, and another symmetric third-order response above the commensurate frequency. The 
S-plane bandpass-prototype network synthesis for combline and capacitively loaded interdigital bandpass filters [9] was developed 
by successfully applying the transformed variable Z-plane techniques [10]. In this work, each transmission zeros contributed from 
the six elements will be rigorously synthesized into the transfer function, along with other passband specifications, using the same 
method. 
By properly selecting the commensurate frequency (greater than twice the passband center frequency), the spurious harmonics 
rejection can be improved, and the overall circuit size reduction can be expected. Assume a third-order bandpass filter is to be 
designed to meet the following specifications: the passband center frequency is at 1.0cf  GHz, the passband ripple is 0.1 dB 
( 2 0.0233  ), and the lower and upper cutoff frequencies of the passband are 1 0.7f  GHz and 2 1.3f  GHz, which is equivalent 
to a 60% fractional bandwidth. The synthesis procedure in [9], [10] can be followed to derive the driving point impedance. 
The transformation to be used in approximation and synthesis is given by

This completes the approximation procedure in the transformed Z-plane. For the dual circuit of Fig. 3(b), 211( )Z Z  is made equal to

short-circuited stub. All six elements are quarter-wave length in terms of the commensurate frequency 3.3of  GHz. Fig. 3(c) 
depicts the circuit simulation results.  
It is noted that wideband filter synthesis methods were developed and matured around 1960~1970. In Orchard and Temes’s 1968 
classic paper [10], numerical advantage of performing both approximation and synthesis in the transformed variables has been 
demonstrated. This method was used by Wenzel to synthesis combline filter and capacitively loaded interdigital filter [9]. We use 
the same Orchard and Temes’s method to synthesis our proposed wideband filter. In other words, we use the same synthesis method 
to design different filters. The table below compares Wenzel’s designs to ours.

longer centered at its commensurate frequency, but at about half of that in [6]. This explains its size reduction. 
V. Conclusion 
The designs of filters with stub-loaded multiple-mode resonators were done previously by the analysis of resonators and then 
computer simulation and optimization of various parameters. In this research, an exact synthesis procedure has been adopted. It is 
based on S-plane bandpass prototype for good spurious suppression and size reduction. Approximation procedure of the driving 
point impedance, with the help of the transformed variable Z, has been demonstrated by a six-element example. Network models 
and implementation considerations have also been presented. The compact realization by microstrip lines has justified the proposed 
method. This research is also available for solving some ambiguities associated with the other methods of multiple-mode-resonator 
filter design.
