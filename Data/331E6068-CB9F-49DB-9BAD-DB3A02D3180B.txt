Keywords: Lagrangean Relaxation, Network Attack and Defense, Optimization Problem, 
Resource Allocation Strategy, Survivability 
 
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the effective and efficient protection 
of critical information infrastructures, especially the Internet, has become an even more 
important issue. With the inevitability of such attacks, perfect robustness of the Internet is 
unobtainable; hence, in recent years, the concept of security has been increasingly 
generalized as an issue of survivability. Since there are only two states, safe and 
compromised, in the context of security, the concept is definitely insufficient to fully describe 
how a system can sustain normal services under abnormal conditions, including random 
errors and malicious attacks. Consequently, the issue of survivability has drawn increasing 
attention in recent years. 
To enhance network survivability effectively, a network operator must invest a fixed 
amount of budget  (e.g. money, time, and manpower) and distribute it properly. On the other 
hand, an attacker also has limited resource to launch an attack, so he won’t choose to 
compromise a network if the incurred attack cost exceeds his acceptable level. Thus, a 
potential attacker will always adjust his strategies to compromise a network at minimal cost, 
if he knows the defense resource allocation strategy of the network operator. For that reason, 
a network operator’s budget allocation strategy should consider that an attacker will 
constantly adjust his strategy to attain his goals. It is therefore a major challenge for network 
operators to derive adequate defense strategies against attacks. However, there has been no 
theoretical research that would enable network operators to gain a global understanding of 
how to allocate limited budgets to network components so that the survivability of their 
networks can be maximized to deter attackers’ intrusions. 
However, there has been little research on the issues of defense and attack based on 
mathematical programming models. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no 
mathematical model that deals with defense and attack behavior in the context of 
survivability has been proposed. In this project, we therefore propose three mathematical 
models that fully describe the conflict between an attacker and a defender, and show different 
levels of network survivability for given defense resource allocation strategies. We then 
analyze the problem with optimization-based models, in which the problem structure is, by 
nature, a mixed integer programming problem. 
 
Factor (NCF) [7] and the Link Connectivity Factor (LCF) [8]. The former deals with the 
removal of nodes, while the latter is concerned with the removal of links. Several 
methodologies can be used to analyze the connectivity of networks. Among them, 
linear/non-linear programming [8] and simulation with given metrics [7] are the most 
popular. 
In general, network performance is analyzed by calculating the probability that the 
network will fulfill its given QoS metrics. Because of the variety of network performance 
metrics, many diverse methodologies, such as Markov chain [5], game theory [9] and 
simulation with given metrics [10], can be used for analysis. 
 
1.3. Motivation and objectives of this paper 
 
To enhance network survivability effectively, a network operator must invest a fixed 
amount of budget  (e.g. money, time, and manpower) and distribute it properly. On the other 
hand, an attacker also has limited resource to launch an attack, so he won’t choose to 
compromise a network if the incurred attack cost exceeds his acceptable level. Thus, a 
potential attacker will always adjust his strategies to compromise a network at minimal cost, 
if he knows the defense resource allocation strategy of the network operator.  
In this paper, to understand how well a network can sustain malicious attacks, we evaluate 
the minimal attack cost incurred by an attacker who attempts to disconnect critical 
Origin-Destination pair(s) (OD pair(s)). The concept of attack cost relates to the effort an 
attacker needs to make to attain his goal. However, to the best of our knowledge, no 
mathematical model that deals with defense and attack behavior in the context of 
survivability has been proposed. We therefore propose two mathematical models that fully 
describe the conflict between an attacker and a defender, and show different levels of network 
survivability for given defense resource allocation strategies. Briefly, Model 1 deals with the 
disconnection of at least one critical OD pair in a network, while Model 2 addresses the 
disconnection of all critical OD pairs in a network. 
 
1.4. Outline of this paper 
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a min mathematical 
formulation of an attack-defense scenario is proposed, which is later shown to be a trivial 
problem. In Section 3, another min mathematical formulation of an advanced attack-defense 
scenario is proposed, for which a Lagrangean Relaxation-based solution approach is 
presented. In Section 4, the computational results of the second formulation are reported. 
Finally, in Section 5, we present our conclusions. 
 
2. Problem formulation for model 1 
 
2.1. Problem descriptions and assumptions 
 
The evaluation of the robustness of a network under malicious attack is modeled as an 
optimization problem, in which the objective is to minimize the total attack cost from an 
attacker’s perspective, such that at least one given critical OD pair is disconnected and the 
network cannot survive. 
In this model, we assume that both the attacker and the defender have complete 
information about the targeted network topology. Moreover, the attacker has complete 
information about the defender’s budget allocation. For simplicity, we only consider node 
requires that at least one critical OD pair is disconnected. We depict the phenomenon by 
showing that the sum of the shortest path costs for each OD pair to communicate is greater 
than M. Constraint (IP 1.9) is a set of redundant constraints, since the value of each lc  should 
be either   or Mε ε+ . 
Argument 1 We can relax the equality of Constraint (IP 1.1) as l ic y M ε≤ +  without affecting 
the optimality conditions. 
Argument 2 We can relax the equality of Constraint (IP 1.3) as

2.2. Solution to model 1 
 
Lemma 1 Given a budget allocation strategy, a topology, G= (V, L), and a set of critical OD 
pairs, W, the formulation of Model 1 can be optimally solved by combining the maximum 
flow-minimum cut algorithm [11] and the node splitting method [11] within time complexity 
O(|W|¯(|V|+|L|)¯n), where n is the total budget allocated to the network. 
Proof. The maximum flow-minimum cut algorithm finds the minimum link cost that 
separates the network into two subsets, where the origin node belongs to subset S and the 
destination node belongs to subset S . With the node splitting method, on the other hand, a 
node can be converted into a link by dividing it into two independent subnodes and 
introducing an artificial link to connect the subnodes. By assuming that the link capacity 
between two subnodes of a node is the given budget (i.e., the attack cost) of the node and 
other links’ capacities are infinite, we first transform G(V, L) into G’(V’, L’). Using the 
maximum flow-minimum cut algorithm, the minimum cost of separating G’ into two subsets 
for OD pair w, where w W∈ , can then be denoted by MCTw, which is also the minimum cut 
for OD pair w in G’. Since the network contains |W| critical OD pairs, we can find the 
minimum cost for each OD pair after running the maximum flow-minimum cut algorithm |W| 
times. Thus, the solution to Model 1 is min(MCTw), where w W∈ . Meanwhile, the time 
complexity of the maximum flow-minimum cut algorithm is O((|V|+|L|)¯n), and the time 
complexity of solving Model 1 optimally is O(|W|¯(|V|+|L|)¯n), where n is the total 
capacity (not including the infinite capacity), i.e., the total defense budget, of the network. 
 
3. Problem formulation for model 2 
 
3.1 Problem descriptions and assumptions 
 
We now consider another scenario of the attack-defense problem. Assume that an attacker 
must disconnect all given critical OD pairs to compromise a network.  
The given parameters and decision variables of Model 2 are the same as those of Model 1, 
except that a new given parameter, B, which is the total budget of a defender, is introduced. 
The objective of this formulation (IP2) and the constraints (IP 2.1)~(IP 2.10) of Model 2 are 
the same as those for Model 1, except the two following constraints.

Constraint (IP 2.4) requires that all critical OD pairs must be disconnected. We explain the 
phenomenon by showing that the cost of the shortest path for each OD pair to communicate is 
greater than M. Constraint (IP 2.10) is a redundant constraint. We find a legitimate lower

subject to (LR3) and (LR6). 
 
To solve SUB_2 optimally, we first apply the quick sort algorithm to the sum of the 
parameters of each yi to obtain an array in ascending order. To satisfy Constraint (LR6), we 
choose Vlb nodes from the left of the array, and set their yi values to one. The yi values of the 
remaining nodes are decided by their associated parameters. If it is positive, the value of yi is 
set to zero to minimize this subproblem; otherwise, it is set to one. The time complexity of 
SUB_2 is O(|V|log|V|).

As Constraints (LR4) and (LR5) show, twl and cl have two combinations each. We can 
therefore apply an exhaustive search to determine the values of twl and cl, depending on which 
combination derives the smallest objective function value. To optimally solve SUB_3, we 
further decompose it into |L| independent subproblems. The time complexity of SUB_3 is 
O(|W|¯|L|). 
 
According to the weak Lagrangean duality theorem [12], the optimal value of the 
Lagrangean Relaxation (LR) problem is, by nature, a lower bound (for minimization 
problems) of the objective function value in the primal problem. The tightest Lagrangean 
lower bound can be derived by tuning the Lagrangean multipliers, i.e., by maximizing the LR 
problem. There are several methods for solving this problem, of which the Subgradient 
optimization technique [13] is the most popular. 
 
Getting Primal Feasible Solutions 
To obtain the primal feasible solutions of (IP2), we consider the solutions of the LR 
problem. By using the Lagrangean Relaxation method and the Subgradient method to solve 
the LR problem, we not only get a theoretical lower bound on the primal objective function 
value, but also obtain good hints for getting primal feasible solutions. However, as some 
critical and difficult constraints are relaxed to obtain the easily-solvable LR problem, the 
solutions obtained from ZD may not be valid for the primal problem. Thus, we need to 
develop good heuristics to tune the values of the decision variables, so that primal feasible 
solutions can be obtained. Our proposed heuristics are as follows.

associated constraints, and proposed well-formulated mathematical models. To the best of our 
knowledge, this paper is the first to model attack-defense scenarios as mathematical 
programming problems in the context of survivability. Furthermore, we have provided 
solution approaches to find the minimal attack cost for both models, and derived a legitimate 
lower bound on the number of nodes an attacker would need to target in Model 2. The 
proposed lemma is another major contribution. After studying the problem structure of Model 
1, we find trivial solution for the problem and present it as elegant lemma. 
Finally, we have evaluated different topologies and observed their ability to maintain the 
connections of all critical OD pairs under malicious attack. The experimental results show 
that a random network can survive better than a scale-free network. However, with a proper 
budget allocation strategy, a scale-free network can achieve the higher level of robustness 
than a random network most of the time. 
We believe that our modeling techniques can be extended to different attack-defense 
scenarios in the context of survivability in which the survivability metrics include “any 
number of given critical OD-pairs are disconnected,” “a single core node is survivable,” or 
“multiple core nodes are survivable.” Besides considering the state of a node is compromised 
or not merely, we could lead into the concept of probability to define the likelihood of a node 
being properly functional. We are also interested in the extent to which our methods can be 
extended to scenarios with the interactive dependency of network nodes, and specific 
application parameters of wireless networks, mobile phone networks, and other kinds of 
network environment.

allocate security budgets effectively. To this end, we propose two mathematical models: the 
protection strategies for defenders (PSD) model and the probabilistic protection strategies for 
defenders (PPSD) model, to formulate attack-defense scenarios. Our objective is to provide 
defenders with effective defense resource allocation strategies to protect the core node, so 
that the cost of compromising the node would be unacceptable to an attacker. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose the PSD 
model, and present a Lagrangean Relaxation-based solution approach for obtaining near 
optimal protection strategies. In Section 3, the second mathematical formulation, the PPSD 
model, is proposed. It is an extension of the PSD model and employs heuristics to calculate 
good primal feasible solutions. In Section 4, the results of computational experiments on the 
PSD and PPSD models are reported. Finally, in Section 5, we present our conclusions. 
 
2. Problem formulation for the PSD model 
 
2.1. Problem description and assumptions 
 
To compromise a core node, an attacker must find a suitable path to it and compromise all 
the intermediate nodes on that path. However, compromising a node costs the attacker some 
resources, such as time, money, and man-power. From a defender’s perspective, if more 
defense resources are allocated to a node, its security will be improved and the attacker’s 
costs will be increased. However, since defense resources are limited, the defender must 
adopt an effective resource allocation strategy to maximize the attacker’s costs. 
In the worst-case scenario, if the attacker can obtain complete information about the target 
network and use it intelligently, he will find the path with the minimal attack cost to 
compromise the core node. Meanwhile, the defender will try to maximize the minimized 
attack cost through different budget allocation strategies. In response, the attacker will then 
search for another path with the minimal attack cost to compromise the core node. 
Next, we define the notations used in this paper and formulate the problem.

To solve (SUB 1-2) optimally, we adopt some mathematical techniques to carefully choose 
proper values for the random variables bi and yi. The time complexity is O(|N|2).  
 
Based on the weak Lagrangean duality theorem [9], the optimal value of problem (LR 1) is, 
by its nature, the lower bound (for minimization problems) of the objective function value in 
the primal problem. We try to obtain the tightest lower bound of (LR 1) by applying the 
subgradient optimization technique proposed in [10] to tune the Lagrangean multipliers.  
 
Getting primal feasible solutions 
Information provided by the multipliers is very helpful in deriving a heuristic that can 
solve the problem (IP 2). In this case, the multiplier vector 2iu  is adjusted by the 
function ˆ( ) ( )i p i i i
i N
y a bδ

−∑ , which indicates the relative importance of each node i. This gives us 
a hint about how to allocate the budget. Our proposed heuristic is described in Table 3. 
 
Table 3. Algorithm for getting a primal feasible solution for the PSD model 
Step 1  Construct a minimal defense region by applying the labeling and the 
removal processes. The labeling process is based on a breadth-first 
search, and the removal process tests whether each outer layer node is 
minimize the weight of compromising the core node. Constraint (4-1) requires that the 
selected path for the OD pair should be the path with the minimal weight.  
 
3.2. Solution to the PPSD model 
 
By applying the Lagrangean relaxation method with a vector of Lagrangean multipliers u1 
and u2, we can transform the PPSD model into the following Lagrangean relaxation problem 
(LR 2). In this case, Constraints (4-1) and (4-2) are relaxed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, we assume that Pi(bi) follows an exponential distribution with λ, which 
indicates that the compromise probability will be rapidly reduced by the additional budget 
allocated to a node. We can decompose the optimization problem (LR 2) into the following 
two independent subproblems and solve them optimally.

Figure 3. Effect of different network topologies 
 
In Figure 1, the attack costs incurred by our proposed algorithm (Table 3) are always 
higher than those of the other algorithms used for comparison. The efficacy of the LR-based 
algorithm’s solution is clearly demonstrated as the size of the network increases. Figure 2 
shows that the survivability factor of the proposed algorithm is consistently higher than that 
of the other algorithms. Thus, by applying the algorithm, the core node will be more robust 
and secure. Meanwhile, Figure 3 demonstrates that a network’s topological structure strongly 
influences its robustness against attack. The attack costs in large grid networks are higher 
than those in large random and scale-free networks [2]. The reason is that the average number 
of nodes that must be compromised in a grid network is higher than in a random or scale-free 
network. This is due to the small-world phenomenon [2]. Therefore, we can conclude that the 
defense-in-depth strategy [11] is an important factor in network survivability.   
 
4.3 Experiment results for the PPSD model 
 
The experiment results for scenario 1 of the PPSD model are similar to the results of the 
PSD model in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The proposed algorithm (Table 4) incurs higher attack 
costs than the two simple algorithms, and maintains a higher level of survivability in 
different-sized network topologies. We observe that, if the values of λ1 and λ2 are similar, the 
network is homogeneous.

Figure 7.  Attack costs of different network topologies in scenario 2 
 
In scenario 2 of the PPSD model, the curves of the LR-based algorithms are all above 
those of SA1 and SA2. Thus, the solution quality of LR is better than that of SA1 or SA2, as 
shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Considering both the defense-in-depth concept and 
the nodes’ characteristics, the attack costs incurred by the proposed algorithm are 
approximately equal in different-sized network topologies, as shown in Figure 7. This implies 
that the proposed protection strategy is very adaptive such that we can obtain almost the same 
result in networks of different size and topology.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
We have focused on two issues. First, to improve the security of the core node in a network, 
we have proposed two mathematical models to formulate attack-defense scenarios and 
provide defenders with useful defense resource allocation strategies. Second, we have 
considered network survivability and evaluated the maximal minimized attack costs in 
different scenarios. 
The mathematical models represent the major contribution of this work. We have carefully 
researched the security problem’s characteristics, identified its objectives and associated 
constraints, and proposed well-formulated mathematical models to solve it. To the best of our 
knowledge, the proposed approach is one of the few that model attack-defense scenarios as 
mathematical programming problems in the context of survivability. In addition, we have 
provided solution approaches to determine the attack costs for both models.  
Finally, our evaluation of different topologies revealed the following phenomenon. In a 
homogeneous network, the defense-in-depth strategy is the most important issue to be 
considered when allocating a defense budget. Because a grid network does not contain short 
cuts, the attacker must compromise more nodes than in random or scale-free networks. 
Therefore, a defender can employ nodes with more levels when allocating defense resources 
in a grid network, which means that an attacker must expend further resources to compromise 
the core node. However, if a network is heterogeneous, the defender must pay more attention 
to each node’s characteristics. In random and scale-free networks, the nodes that provide 
short cuts are the most vulnerable. Therefore, we allocate more budget resources to them to 
improve the protection of the core node. The greater the differences between the nodes, the 
stronger will be the impact of each node’s characteristics. The proposed solution approach is 
not only very effective, it is also adaptable to different attack/defense scenarios. 
We believe that the proposed models can be extended to different attack-defense scenarios 
in the context of survivability, where the survivability metrics include “the percentage of 
critical OD pairs disconnected,” “the number of core nodes that are survivable in a multiple 
core node environment,” or “the percentage of valuable information not stolen.” In our future 
work, we will investigate the extent to which our methods can be applied to scenarios 
involving the interactive dependency of network nodes. We will also examine specific

gain the most valuable information that will cause the maximum harm to the network 
operator. 
Of course, the reward an attacker can gain may change when the defense resource 
allocation strategy changes. Hence, to evaluate the efficiency of an attack under different 
defense strategies, we analyze the susceptibility of the network. The susceptibility metric, 
shown in the Equation 1, is defined as the percentage of stolen information. It is assumed that 
the attacker can steal all the information held by a node once the node is compromised 
successfully. Assume that di is the value of information held by node i, where i∈N.

Note that the network we discuss here is at the AS level.  
 
2.2. Problem Formulation of the AS Model 
 
The attack scenario is as follows. Initially, the attacker controls one node that connects 
directly to the targeted network, and that node is viewed as the initial hop-site to reach other 
nodes. Since the targeted network is at the AS level, the attacker cannot simply attack any 
node directly. Instead, he can only reach uncompromised nodes from their immediate 
compromised neighbors. Thus, the attacker needs to construct an attack tree, i.e., a tree 
consisting of compromised nodes and rooted at the initial hop-site. To consider the worst case 
scenario, we assume the attacker is smart enough to obtain complete information about the 
targeted network in advance. 
The effort needed to compromise a node depends on the resources allocated to defend the 
node. Generally, the more defense resources a node has, the more robust it is. However, a 
node still has some defense capability, even if no defense resources are allotted to it, since the 
node itself is a shell for protecting the information. On the other hand, the total attack 
resources are limited by the allocated budget. Our objective is to understand how an attacker 
can distribute his limited resources effectively and intelligently in order to maximize his 
benefit. To achieve our objective, we formulate the above problem as a maximization 
mathematical model (AS model).

We decompose (LR 1) into three independent and easily solvable optimization 
subproblems with respect to decision variables xp, yi, and ai, and solve the respective 
subproblems optimally. 
 
Getting primal feasible solutions 
Solutions to (LR 1) and their associated Lagrangean multipliers are considered in order to 
obtain a primal feasible solution for (IP 1). The concept of the proposed heuristic, denoted as 
Heuristic_LR_1, is described below.  
The main concept of this greedy-based heuristic arises from the attacker’s strategy of 
compromising nodes with smaller weights but moderate path costs in order to maximize the 
gain. Thus, only attack paths comprised of activated nodes, i.e., nodes with smaller weights, 
will be constructed. The total computational complexity of this heuristic is O(|N|log2|N|).

5. Examine each activated and uncompromised node. If its path cost is affordable for 
the attacker, apply sufficient attack power to compromise the node and all other 
uncompromised nodes on its path; then add all the nodes to the attack tree. 
6. Repeat Steps 3 to 5 until the attacker has insufficient attack resources to 
compromise any node.

of uncompromised nodes through their compromised neighbors. The algorithm is based on 
the greedy method, and the total computational time of this heuristic is O(|N|log|N|).

4.3. Experiment Results 
 
To compare attack behavior under different scenarios, we use the network susceptibility 
metric to evaluate the degree to which the attacker’s objective is achieved. The greater the 
susceptibility, the more successful the attack. The LR value means the susceptibility 
calculated by the optimal feasible solution derived by the Lagrangean relaxation process. The 
LB value is a lower bound on LR, obtained from the smaller one of (LR 1) and (LR 2); and 
SA1, SA2, and SA3 are the susceptibilities derived by simple algorithms 1, 2, and 3 
respectively.

Figure 4-1 Susceptibility of medium-sized networks under different scenarios (|N| = 100) 
Figures 4-1 to 4-4 show the susceptibility of the targeted network under different topology 
types, numbers of nodes, and damage distribution patterns. From these figures, we observe: 
• Networks with budget allocation strategy B3 are the most robust and therefore the most 
difficult for an attacker to compromise. This finding is consistent with the common idea 
that defense resources should be allocated according to the importance of each node. 
• For grid networks, the network susceptibility of the B1 and B2 strategies is close, and the 
gap between them decreases with the growth of the networks. This is because the degree 
of most nodes in a grid network is four, and the average degree approaches four when the 
network size increases. 
• In random and scale-free networks, the average degree and the actual degree of each node 
diverge because of their randomness and power-law degree distribution characteristic [4] 
respectively. Thus, the B1 strategy, which treats each node equally, fails to reflect the 
discrepancy between the nodes, and results in high network susceptibility.  
• Networks under the D3 scenario have the lowest susceptibility of the three damage 
distribution patterns. This result indicates that a network is more robust if “all nodes are 
created equal”. 
 
Figures 4-5 compare the solution quality of the proposed Lagrangean relaxation-based 
algorithm with simple algorithms 1, 2, and 3, and demonstrates the gap between LRs and LBs. 
From the figure, we observe: 
• Our proposed heuristic outperforms the three simple algorithms in all cases. Our attack 
strategy causes the highest network susceptibility. This indicates that the proposed 
Lagrangean relaxation-based algorithm is not only capable of solving the AS model, it is 
also applicable to various types of network topology. The gaps between LRs and LBs are 
small, which shows that the proposed approach can derive a near-optimal solution to the 
AS model. 
• Simple algorithm 2 performs very well in grid networks, but fails in scale-free networks. 
This strategy is only useful when there are multiple paths between the source and the 
target, as the attacker can make a detour when encountering nodes with a high defense 
capability. However, in the case of scale-free networks, the existence of “hubs”, i.e., 
highly connected nodes [5], reduces the efficiency of simple algorithm 2, leading the rapid 
consumption of the attack budget. 
• Simple algorithm 3 performs reasonably well in all types of network, especially scale-free 
networks. Due to this algorithm’s local-information-awareness property, its solution 
quality is theoretically worse than that of the other algorithms. However, it turns out to be 
the opposite. One possible reason is that when an attacker has too much information, he 
may not be able to fully utilize it to develop a perfect attack strategy. On the other hand, 
the “six degrees of separation” property of scale-free networks allows an attacker to 
collect complete information about the targeted network once he has compromised several 
hub nodes. 
• Generally, scale-free networks are more susceptible to attack than the other two topologies; 
grid networks are the least susceptible. Our finding that scale-free networks are more 
vulnerable to malicious attacks is consistent with previous research [5]. In contrast, the 
regular structure of a grid network makes it difficult for an attacker to compromise 
valuable nodes arbitrarily.
