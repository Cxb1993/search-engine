Abstract 
The hybrid multi-scale method, which 
combines molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation and finite element method (FEM), 
with the implementation of parallel 
computing is employed to simulate the 
nanoindentation process in the project. We 
utilize the hybrid multi-scale method to 
construct the copper substrate of 20 nm 
thickness that performance the 
nanoindentation analysis. Moreover, we also 
implement the same scale of full MD as the 
hybrid multi-scale model, and compare with 
the mechanical parameter of two models 
including the indentation curve, the atomic 
stress of substrate, the hardness and Young’s 
modulus. From the results of the comparisons 
and analysis of two models under 
nanoindentation, we have confirmed the 
accuracy of the hybrid multi-scale model.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Over the years a number of approaches have been developed to simulate 
dynamics in condensed phases. In the atomistic regime, the molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation technique has been successfully carried out to investigate the mechanical 
behaviors of structures on nanoscale [1-4]. Because of the availability of accurate 
interatomic potentials for a range of materials, classical MD simulations have become 
prominent as a tool for elucidating complex physical phenomena. However, the length 
and time scales that can be probed using MD are still fairly limited. In principle, 
length scales of MD simulations could be made larger, but simulations with 1010
 
particles must be performed by the most advanced computers currently available, in 
despite of the real physical systems usually containing 2310
 
particles [5]. Therefore, 
for the study of nanoscale mechanics and materials, the analytic model up to a scale 
of several microns, consisting of billions of atoms, which is too large for MD 
simulations. 
Current parallel supercomputers can deal with up to billions of atoms, where the 
spatial size is still in sub-micro meters. Similarly, in regard to the temporal scale 
calculations, the parallel algorithm in MD simulations is still very difficult to achieve 
a realistic condition as compared with the experiments to date. Consequently, it is 
currently impossible to model an entire macroscopic domain with atoms by using MD 
simulations, despite the recent advances in computational power. By contrast, the 
finite element method (FEM) can be successfully modeled to describe the physical 
phenomenon passing through material on macroscopic scale [6,7]. By means of FEM 
analysis, the analytic model for the scientific problems can be simply solved by the 
highly efficient calculation, tying in parallel algorithm with FEM simulations, which 
significantly enlarge to a practical time and length scales. Besides, it has also a strong 
 12
method in the past decades, a classic example is the pioneering work of Clementi and 
coworkers [9]
 
in 1980s where they used quantum mechanics, atomistic dynamics, and 
fluid dynamics to predict the tidal circulation in Buzzard’s Bay Massachusetts. They 
first used high quality quantum mechanical methods to evaluate the interaction of 
several water molecules. Since then, multiscale simulation has been applied to the 
various fields, including nanocomponent analysis [10,16,21,35], crack fracture 
analysis [9,11,16,20,22,35-36,39,41], wave propagation [14,20], nanoindentation 
[16,29,30-33], nanometric cutting [5], and stress distribution analysis [25,34]. 
Nowadays, there were many methodologies to couple MD and FEM which had been 
successfully developed. Systematically, these methodologies can be classified into 
several categories: the bridging scale method (BSM) [8,10-13,17-20], meshfree 
particle method (MPM) [16,21], the quasicontinuum method (QCM) 
[5,22,29-33,38,40], the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) [37], the 
coupled atomistic dislocation dynamics (CADD) [23-24,28], the macroscopic 
atomistic ab initio dynamics (MAAD) [9,39], the coupling of length scales method 
(CLS) [35-36], the finite element and atomistic method (FEAt) [15,27,41]. As the 
present article is not intended as an exhaustive review, the interested reader can refer 
to the multiple scale review papers of Liu et al. [42], and Curtin et al. [28]. 
Among these previously mentioned literatures of multiscale research, a widely 
used approach is to implement the coupling through a so-called “handshake” region, 
which is essentially the interface between the MD and FEM regions. In this method, 
the finite element mesh is graded down to the atomic lattice size in an overlap, or 
‘‘handshake’’, region; the dynamics is governed by a total Hamiltonian function that 
combines the separate Hamiltonians of the different regions in an appropriate way 
[9,14,15,23-28,34-36,39,41]. In the handshake region, a certain weighted factor is 
performed between the MD description and the coarse grid description. These

2.1. The multiscale model of nanoindentation 
 
In describing the present hybrid scheme, it is helpful to use the initial 
configuration of the hybrid simulation of nanoindentation. The simulated model of the 
indentation problem along with the arrangement in the present simulation is shown in 
Fig. 1. The simulated models consist of both a sharp rigidity tip of indenter and the 
nickel substrate. The sharp tip of the indenter has a conical shape with a diameter of 6 
nm and height of 3 nm, and the dimensional scales of the nickel substrate are 
approximately 150 Å×150 Å×200 Å. As shown in Fig. 1, the simulation system of 
nickel substrate is geometrically decomposed into three dynamic regions: the 
atomistic molecular dynamics region (MD); the finite element region (FE); and the 
MD/FE handshake region (HS). In Fig. 1(b), the blue is the rigidity atoms, the red are 
the composite atoms/nodes constituting the HS region between MD and FE, the 
yellow above the HS region are the MD atoms, and the yellow below the HS region 
are the FE nodes. The region close to the indentation site is simulated with the 
atomistic MD resolution, representing the mono-crystalline nickel of (100) 
crystallographic orientation surface, while the remaining regions are simulated with 
the continuum FE resolution, representing the mesh grids of nickel material. The 
connection between the MD and FE regions is depend on the HS region, in which the 
FE mesh is refined down to the atomic scale in such a way that each FE node 
coincides with an MD atom. Continuum FE is used to efficiently describe large parts 
of the system that are elastically deformed but do not include highly strained or 
broken bonds. Closer to the indentation zone, as the strains become larger and the 
continuum description becomes less accurate, atomistic MD which requires a selected 
empirical many-body potential is adopted to provide a computationally fast atomic 
description. Note that not the entire regions of the multiscale model are shown in Fig. 
 16
the particles in the MD region, as shown in Fig. 2. Two-dimensional views of the HS 
region and its surroundings from MD and FE regions are represented as the multiscale 
model. Note that not all of the MD and FE regions are shown in Fig. 2 since their 
extent is too large. In Fig. 2, on the above side of the HS region is the atomistic region 
in which every atom is explicitly represented by the nickel crystalline lattices. On the 
below side of the HS region, there is a FE mesh with its associated nodes. Within the 
HS region, the MD crystalline lattices and the FE mesh grids are overlapped, yielding 
a one-to-one correspondence between MD atoms and FE nodes although not all atom 
sites are nodal positions. Moving away from the HS region on the continuum side, the 
FE nodes become increasingly sparse and the corresponding elements become larger 
so as to always completely fill the physical space. The particles belong to the MD part 
that are governed by the interaction via the interatomic potential, yet are governed by 
the continuum linear elasticity theory if the particles belong to the FE part. 
For these hybrid atom/node particles, the weighted function of an average 
Hamiltonian proposed by Lidorikis et al. [26,34] is utilized in the present simulations. 
Formally, a total hybrid Hamiltonian can be written as follows:

where N , Ne , and Nne are the number of total particles, elements, and nodes per

many-body potential terms used in MD, and u l , k k  are the FE displacement vector 
and stiffness matrix, respectively, for element l. The tight-binding potential for nickel 
involves only short range interactions; therefore, two bi-layers of Ni (100) depicted as 
L1 and L2 in Fig. 2 are sufficient to make up the HS region. In the present multiscale 
model, the following weights in the hybrid scheme to be the most accuracy as

substrate. The indenter tip is positioned on the top of the substrate surface at the 
center, held at a constant distance from the substrate before the commencement of the 
indentation process. Because the substrate of MD part is composed of more than 
140,000 nickel atoms in the simulated model, we implement parallel computations by 
using the atom decomposition method [44]. 
In the present simulations, the interatomic force derived from the potential 
function is described by the tight-binding potential as follows:

crystal structures, to silicon nanoindentation. 
In the above-mentioned references, the results obtained from the multiscale 
model of nanoindentation all have a good agreement with the variation tendency of 
nanoindentation. Furtherly, in the reference [33], Smith et al. also used both the 2D 
and 3D FE meshes to couple MD in their multiscale models. The compared results 
obtained from the nanoindentation simulations between these two models indicate 
that there are no obvious differences under the avoidance of the substrate effect, i.e., 
the specific value of the indentation depth divided by the substrate thickness can not 
be exceeded 10% (0.1) [47]. Accordingly, we can know that it is suitable to adopt the 
2D FE model to couple MD in our multiscale simulations under the avoidance of the 
substrate effect in order to obtain the maximum computation cost for the length scale 
expansion. Therefore, in our multiscale model of FE part, the nodes not constrained 
by boundary conditions or stuck to the indenter are free to move in the xz plane, but 
are not permitted to move in the y direction, i.e., plane strain conditions of FE. 
For this study, we use the quadrilateral elements of four nodes and the triangular 
elements of three nodes for grid coarsening with linear interpolation for the 
displacement field. Fixed boundary conditions are imposed on the bottom of the mesh, 
and periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the sides, perpendicularly to the 
indentation surface. For the constitutive relations, we use the elastic constants of 
nickel as determined from the tight-binding potential. We also use the lumped mass 
approximation, i.e., the mass is collapsed on the nodes instead of being uniformly 
distributed. This approximation has been shown to be more appropriate for small 
atomic-size elements [35,37]. In order to cooperate with the application of parallel 
algorithm in MD part, there are more than 15,000 mesh nodes in FE part also 
implemented by using the parallel computation of the parallel substructure method 
[48].

positioned 10 Å apart in order to avoid the effect of attractive force which occurs as 
they gradually approach each other. After being held at the initial position for a period 
of time, both the tip and substrate are relaxed to their equilibrium configuration as a 
result of the interatomic forces acting on each individual atom. In the indentation 
stage, the indentation is modeled by moving the tip 25 Å downward at a constant 
speed of 5 m/s, and then retracting the tip back to its original position at the same 
speed. To acquire the most efficient calculations, the tip atoms also are assumed to be 
the same as the rigidity atoms; however, the tip atoms’ indentation velocity is given 
by the displacement-rate at each time step of the simulation for the force interaction 
between the tip and the substrates. The system temperature of simulated models is 
kept at 300 K during the entire process. The size of the incremental time steps 
employed in the computations must be smaller than the thermal motion periods in the 
simulated system, but not so small as to be affected by the accumulations of inevitable 
round-off errors during the computational process. In the present computations, a 
compromised choice of time step Δt=1 fs is thus employed. 
 
3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
In this section, we illustrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the 
combined MD and FE approach. We take nanoindentation as an investigation 
problem for assessing the performance of the coupled method, and confirm the 
accuracy of our hybrid model as compared with the results of full MD simulations. 
The present coupling method adopted from references [26,34] was first applied to the 
nanoindentation problem and compared against full atomistics on a problem sized to 
be accessible using atomistics. The comparison between indentation curves of the full 
MD and the hybrid FE/MD simulations is summarized in Fig. 3. The vertical axis 
 24
indentation curve for the multiscale simulations are similar to the indentation curve of 
full MD simulations. Therefore, the result of multiscale simulations from the 
indentation curve exhibits a good agreement with atomistic solution, which proves 
that the present multiscale model demonstrates the accuracy from nanoindentation on 
the nanoscale. 
Finally, in order to further examine whether the coupling state between MD and 
FE in the present mutiscale model is seamlessly, we take the deformation morphology 
of nickel substrate exerted by the tip at the maximum indentation depth, as shown in 
Fig. 4. Under the highly plastic deformation exerted by the tip, the material 
deformation from the atomistic descriptions of MD region near the indentation zone 
to the grids descriptions of FE region away from the indenter has a smooth and 
continuous variation, which shows a consistent gradation in the entire region of 
multiscale model. Besides, a more powerful signature of seamless coupling represents 
a validation of the multiscale model in Fig. 4, which is that the deformation profiles 
pass from the MD region to the FE regions with no visible discontinuity at the 
FE/MD interface; i.e., the coupling of the MD region to the FE region appears 
seamless; this observation remains true even at higher spatial magnifications. These 
features effectively test the adaptability of our multiscale model, which reveals that 
the fine scale waves pass out of the MD region properly at the same time as the coarse 
scale pulse propagates into the coarse scale region when the boundary condition is 
correctly applied.

the quantum mechanical geometry and binding energy, the binding energy determined from Dreiding force field with 
these optimal parameters displaying good agreement with the experimental result.23 All parameters used to model the 
interaction between the TCMB network and the Au (111) surface in Dreiding force field can be found in reference 23. 
 
3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
        Figure 1 shows the cohesive energy as a function of temperature. It can be observed that as the temperature increase 
the cohesive energy shows a significant fluctuation behavior. Moreover, as the temperature increasing from 30K to 174K, 
the cohesive energy increases rapidly, which value are from about -4.58 kcal/mol to -4.32kcal/mol. However, as the 
temperature greater than 174K, the cohesive energy shows a significant decrease and then will increase slightly.  These 
behaviors can be attributed to that the structure arrangement of TCMB monolayer has been changed. The insets in Fig. 1 
illustrate the initial structure (10K) and some deformation structure at some specific temperatures (70K, 100K, 160K, and 
190K). At temperature of 10K, it is observed that the monolayer are formed by hydrogen bond between the TCMB 
molecules, which is connected between the hydrogen atom in COOH and the oxygen atom in COOH. The structure of 
monolayer also shows a regular arrangement and has a similar size of pore structure on the Au (111) substrate. However, 
as the temperature gradually increasing, it will make the alky chain possess enough kinetic energy to run through the 
torsion energy barrier. Therefore, the torsion behavior is produced in the O-C single bond in alky chain, which creats the 
local deformation and changes the size of pore structure of monolayer as shown in the insets (b), (c), (d) and (e) (circled in 
blue color). The arrow in the insets indicate the alky group whose hydrogen atoms directly interact with the Au surface. 
Here, each insets only illustrates two interaction pairs by arrows. But, the total number of interaction pairs at 10K, 70K, 
100K, 160K and 190K are  about 14, 13, 12, 8, and 11 in the simulation model, respectively. 
        In order to investigate the temperature effect on the dynamical behavior of TCMB monolayer on the Au (111) 
substrate, the migration trajectories are discussed. However, for clear representation, only one of the migration 
trajectories of the TCMB molecules in this monolayer is shown  in Fig. 2. The migration trajectories of center of mass of 
a TCMB molecule at 10K, 70K, 100K, 160K, and 190K are described in Fig. 2(a)-(e), respectively. In fig. 2 (a), it can be 
observed that the TCMB monolayer is located between two Au atoms over the duration from 0.3ns to 5ns. As in the case 
at the higher temperature, the trajectory profile shows that the TCMB molecule will migrate across the surface, and the 
migration region is proportion to the temperature.  From our previous study, we know that the hydrogen atom of alky 
group and Au (111) surface could form the lock-and-key (LAK) pair as the TCMB molecule migrate across the surface. 
Therefore, this complementarity property could lead the molecule migrate along the valley of Au (111) surface in <110> 
direction. Hence, the complementarity property leads the TCMB monolayer migrated along the valley in <110> direction 
on the Au (111) surface as shown in fig. 2 (b), (c), and (e). However, it is found that irregular motion of the trajectory of 
TCMB molecule happened at temperature of 160K. This result can be associated to the effect of structure arrangement on 
its migration behavior. According to the mention above, we knew that the number of alky chain whose hydrogen atoms 
directly interact with the Au surface at 10K, 70K, 100K, 160K and 190K are about 14, 13, 12, 8, and 11, respectively. A 
lower number of interaction pair is appear at 160K.  The fewer number of complementarity pair, therefore, effect the 
migrated behavior of TCMB monolayer. Consquently, the TCMB molecules at 160K has lower possibility which can 
progress along the valley in <110> direction.  
        The mean-squared displacement (MSD) profile have been calculated for 10K, 70K, 100K, 160K and 190K and 
shown in Fig. 3. The MSD profiles of TCMB network for all cases are averaged over the last 4.5ns during the simulation 
at different temperature. The results can be distinguish to two evident tendencies, which are that as the temperature is 
equal to or lower than 70K the TCMB monolayer exhibit a very low translation motion, and that as the temperature is 
greater than 70K the TCMB monolayer exhibit a translation motion. Basically, the MSD profile is depend of the 
temperatre, and  as the temperature increase the MSD curve repressed a higher value.  However, it is not suitable to the 
case at 160K. This result can also be associated to the effect of structure arrangement on its dynamical behavior as 
mention above.  
        The diffusion of the molecule was examined by calculating a self-diffusion coefficient D from their MSD over the 
course of simulation. The self-diffusion coefficient is obtained from the MSD via the Einstein equation, 18 which is 
calculated and summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the D value from high to low are 190K, 100K, 160K, 70K, and 
10K. Basically, the self-diffusion coefficient is proportion to the temperature. However, the TCMB monolay on the 
Au(111) surface at the 160K shows the particular phenomena, which is due to the reason as metion above.  
        Fig. 4(a) and (b) depict the adsorbed energy and the average height between the TCMB monolayer and the Au (111) 
surface as a function of the temperature. They show the similar tendency which is that as continuing to increase the 
temperature the adsorbed energy and the average height will increase. As the temperature is lower than 70K, they show 
the rapid increase; however, as the temperature upon the 70K the curve will increase slightly. The result implies that the 
strength of adsorbed energy depend on the height between the molecule and substrate surface. 
 
4.  CONCLUSIONS 
        The molecular dynamics simulation is employed to investigate the temperature effect on the adsorption behavior and 
the dynamic behavior of monolayer on the Au(111) substrate. It can be observe that the cohesive energy and the local
