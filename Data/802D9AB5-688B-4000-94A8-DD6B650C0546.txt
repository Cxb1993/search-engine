Abstract: 
 This is a three year project. We have reported our research outcome in previous reports. 
Those results can also be seen in our papers in recent years as shown in the list.  In the report, based 
on the hierarchical sliding mode, the report of the direct adaptive approximation based control 
system designed for a class of uncertain coupling systems with a single-input-multi-output (SIMO) 
form is given here. Moreover, two different function approximators are employed in the study; they 
are the well-known fuzzy system form the intelligent system and Fourier series which is a general 
mathematical design. These function approximators have respective advantages. With the direct 
adaptive approximation based control methodological, these function approximators can be updated 
by a common Lyapunov based adaptive law to effectively estimate an uncertain sliding decoupling 
control law which cannot be implemented accordingly due to which the system considered is 
subject to uncertainties. A common robust control law is further provided to enhance the control 
performance owing to the compensation of the approximation errors of those function 
approximators. Simulations are conducted and the obtained results clearly demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

decoupling sliding surfaces have several tunable parameters and the analysis of these parameters is 
not clear at present, thus the estimator designs have been developed for the adaptation of those 
parameters [8][13]. If the system is uncertain, the adaptive approximation based control can be 
employed to design the control law, as proposed in [1] and [16]. This kind of the adaptive control is 
an important methodology for dealing with uncertain systems [1], which can estimate the unknown 
control law or the system function by function approximators. In this study, two different function 
approximators, as the fuzzy system and the Fourier series, are employed in the proposed direct 
adaptive approximation based control system.  
 About the adaptive approximation based control with fuzzy approximator (system), which is 
usually called adaptive fuzzy control. The adaptive fuzzy control system designs have been wildly 
investigated in the literature. The consequent of a considered fuzzy system (approximator) is 
updated by an adaptive law which is derived based on the Lyapunov stable condition. If the fuzzy 
system is utilized to directly approximate a reference control law, it is referred to as the direct 
adaptive fuzzy control system design [5]; the direct adaptive fuzzy control is employed as the 
controller for the considered coupling systems. In another side, the adaptive approximation based 
control with the orthonormal function approximator is also investigated in the paper, and the 
orthonormal function approximator is defined as Furious series. Such an adaptive approximation 
based control system has been investigated in the literature. For example, the authors of [17] and 
[18] employed this kind of approach to estimate both an uncertain system function of an active 
hydraulic suspension system and a normal active suspension system. The authors of [19] also 
employ it to estimate a function of the control law derived for mismatched systems. In our study, 
Fourier series [20] is considered to perform the orthonormal function approximator required in the 
proposed adaptive approximation based control system, which is termed as Fourier approximator. 
 In the study, according to the decoupling sliding surface proposed in [12] and the feedback 
linearization control technique, a reference sliding control law is derived to control the system. 
However, the coupling system considered is assumed to be uncertain such that the reference sliding

where 03,2,1 >=iic  are the bounded sliding constants, which are usually designed by a trial-and-error 
manner. The authors of [11] provided a referable approach to tune these constants. The control law 
of each sub-system can be designed with theirs sliding surface based on the feedback linearization 
technique. For instance, by using the following Lyapunov function, we can design the control law 
for each subsystem,

 About the first sub-system, neglect the chattering phenomenon, the following control law 
with a bounded constant k1>0 can be derived from (3) with i=1 to stabilize the first sub-system,

Also, let i=2 220 2

 However, these control laws, (4) and (5), cannot guarantee the object system (1) to be 
completely stabilized. Therefore, the authors of [12] used the hierarchical sliding mode to derive a 
control law for stabilizing system (1) and such a design is called the decoupling control. Next, a 
model based decoupling sliding control law is proposed based upon the hierarchical sliding mode to 
lead all system states converge to the origin simultaneously.  
 According to [12], the following sliding surface can be employed to develop decoupling 
sliding control laws.

simultaneously. In general, in order to reduce the chattering phenomenon, )sgn( cs  is replaced by 
)/( Φcssat  where Φ  is a bounded positive constant. However, except hu , *u  cannot be actually 
used because 1f , 2f and 3f  are uncertain. In order to coup with this situation, the direct adaptive 
fuzzy control [5] is considered in this study. According to the methodology of the direct adaptive 
approximation based control, several function approximators [1] can be utilized to online 
approximate (estimate) the uncertain reference control law ( *u ) directly. In the study, the fuzzy 
approximator and the Fourier approximator are employed. 
2. Fuzzy approximator design 
 The idea of direct adaptive approximation based control with the fuzzy approximator is to 
use a fuzzy approximator (system) to approximate an uncertain control law directly, and then the 
approximate result is applied to online cancel the unstable source of the system as the approximated 
control law does. In the process, an adaptive law must be designed in order to online update the 
fuzzy approximator. The fuzzy approximator is a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules as: 
  
MlyAs-l lfFlc ,,2,1for    ,   is    THEN    is    IF:Rule L=θ              (12) 
where cs  and Fy  are the input and output, respectively, of the fuzzy approximator, lA  and 
l
fθ  are 
their corresponding fuzzy sets for the l-th rule with lfθ  being fuzzy singleton, and M is the fuzzy 
rule number. Additionally, cs  and cs&  can also be used to define the inputs of the fuzzy 
approximator as considered in [8]. With the center-average defuzzification and the product 
inference, the obtained fuzzy approximator is

where )( cA slµ  is the membership function of fuzzy set lA . As already explained in [6], equation 
(14) is a universal approximator. Equation (13) is usually rewritten as: 
more membership functions to cause a high approximation precision. In next section, another 
function approximator design is provided according to the mathematical idea which has not the 
problem of the membership function design but can not provide the language information.  
3. Fourier approximator design 
 It is known that a piecewise continuous real-valued function )(tF  satisfies the Dirichlet 
conditions, which can be characterized by a generalized Fourier series within a time interval ],0[ T  as:

where 
∞=

,,2,1/2 Lnn Tnpiω are the sinusoidal function frequencies; 0a , na  and nb  are the Fourier 
coefficients. Since the parameter n is a finite constant for the actual application of the Fourier series, 
equation (19) can be re-described by

)sincos()( ωωε  is the approximation error compensated by a robust

equation (21), we can define an orthogonal parameter vector and a coefficient vector as:

The robust control law is designed as

the design of the direct adaptive fuzzy control system is proper.

based control system design is that the gain functions ( 3,2,1=iib ) are required to be certain for the 
designs of the adaptive law and the robust control law. Therefore, how to avoid the use of those 
gain functions in the system design is a considerable research-direction. Moreover, the new design 
of the decoupling sliding surface is a general research direction and the designs of those sliding and 
decoupling constants can be considered into the design of the decoupled sliding surface. We can 
find that the Fourier approximator is also a powerful design mechanism, and only one parameter, 
the cyclic time T, is needed to be tuned. fn  is a value as great as possible upon the practical 
limitation of the system.
