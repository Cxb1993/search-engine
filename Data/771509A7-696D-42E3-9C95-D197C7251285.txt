8  code with k=7 is 
found. This code still has lower power spectral 
density than the EFMPlus code. Computer 
simulations indicate that the proposed TMTR 
code outperforms the EFMPlus code in error 
performance when applied to partial response 
optical recording channels.

二、計畫緣由與目的 
 
In data storage systems, a modulation code 
is known as -constrained code, where  d 
and k represent the maximal and minimal 
number of zeros between two consecutive 
modulation codes, respectively. The main 
function of a  modulation code is to 
improve the recording density and increase the 
storage capacity. The timing information could 
also be controlled using a  modulation 
code. For example, magnetic tape and disk 
systems often adopt (1, 7) or (2, 7) codes, while 
optical systems such as CD and DVD usually 
employ (2, 10) EMF or (2, 10) EMFPlus [1] 
modulation codes.

The maximum transition run (MTR) method 
is a coding method, which limits the number of 
consecutive potential variations being not 
greater than k. The time-varying maximum 
transition run (TMTR) is a further modification 
of the MTR, which sets different constraints for 
the number of consecutive variations depending 
upon whether it starts at an odd or even position. 
The method can increase the minimum distance 
 2
number of zeros after the last one, respectively. 
In similar, parameters  and  represent the 
maximum number of ones before the first zero 
and the maximum number of zeros before the 
first one. Any two sequence satisfying 
 
constraint can be freely concatenated without 
violating the  constraint. In 
order to reduce the consecutive zero length in 
the sequences after concatenation, the following 
substitution rule is applied: assume that a 
sequence y is followed by a sequence x, then

(1) If x has more than 2 zeros before the first one, 
and the last bit of y is a zero, then flip the 
first 2 bits of x into two ones, e.g., 
(000…101) → (110…101). 
(2) Otherwise, use x as the encoder output.  
In the case of (1), a long sequence of 
consecutive zeros is spread into two parts by 
‘11’ in the beginning of the 2nd sequence. 
Because , a sequence begin with ‘11’ is not 
an original code.  
11 =l
Rates of some constructed codes using this 
method are listed in Table I. As displayed, a rate 
11
8  code with  and  constraints 
is found and this code has the k=7 constraint. 
Sequences of even lengths satisfying the 
 constraint can be freely 
concatenated without violating the 
 constraint. Odd lengths 
sequences, however, cannot be freely 
concatenated without violating the 
 constraint. To solve this 
problem, assuming that there is a modulo 11 
counter synchronized to the data, the two 
transitions in arrow can end at times 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 
and 10 relative to counter. The even and odd 
positions in a codeword of 11-bits are given as 
(e o e o e o e o e o e). For example, a sequence 
of 2 codewords will be

 (  x e o e o e o e o e o ), ( e e o e o e o e o e o ) 
where the 1st line, positions of the code bits. 
The 2nd line, even/odd code bit positions. The 
3rd line expresses the maximum number of 
consecutive ‘1’ starting at the position. There is 
no two consecutive ‘2’ in the 3rd line. It means 
that no dominant error event ±(1,-1) will occur. 
To obtain the coding gain of this encoder, a 
time-varying Viterbi detector is required. The 
Viterbi detector for code bit stream positions 
will be the same as shifting the 2nd line to right 
by 1 position. The result is shown in the 4th line. 
The even or odd Viterbi detector properties must 
match the bit position shown in the 4th line. 
 
II. Enumerating Encoding

III. Power Spectral Density 
In DVD systems the power spectral density 
at low frequency, referred to as the 
low-frequency content, of the encoded data 
sequences should normally be maintained as 
low as possible to alleviate interference with 
pilot and focus servo signals. For example in 
addition to satisfying the (2, 10) constraint, the 
16
8  EFMPlus code employed in the DVD 
system is also designed to achieve very low 
low-frequency content to reduce the interference 
between the written signal and the servo signal. 
Efficient low-frequency component suppression 
is a crucial criterion for the 118  
 TMTR code rate. As 
shown in equation (7), the number of sequences 
with length 11 satisfying 
 is 
387, but it only requires 256 codewords in the 
rate

8  TMTR code. The surplus 387-256=131 
code sequences can be exploited for minimizing 
both k-constraint and low-frequency content. 
The 131 surplus code sequences are then used to 
suppress the low-frequency content by reducing 
the running digital sum (RDS). There are two 
tables (a main table and a substitute table) are 
used in the encoder, as shown in Fig. 3. The 
main table consists of 256 codewords (i.e., 
sequences X corresponding to 387132 ≤≤ β  in 
the enumerating algorithm), and the substitute 
table with 131 codewords (i.e., sequences X 
corresponding to ) is used to minimize 
the power spectral density at low frequencies. 
Figure 4 depicts the power spectral density 
(PSD) versus the normalized frequency for the 
1311 ≤≤ β

8  EFMPlus code and the 118  
 )7,2,1,0( 11 === kkk oddeven TMTR code. As shown, 
at frequency of 410 − , the PSDs for both 
EFMPlus and TMTR codes are 40−  dB and 
41−  dB, respectively. The result indicates that 
the 118   TMTR code 
achieves a lower low-frequency content (with 1 
dB lower) than the EFMPlus code. The PSD of

for optical recording systems, although it has a 
higher code rate compared to the 118  
)7,2,1,0( 11 === kkk oddeven  TMTR code. 
 
IV. Simulation Results 
The superiority of the rate 118  
 TMTR code over the 
EFMPlus code is also demonstrated on error 
performance through a computer simulation on 
the EPRII optical channel of the 
form . Figure 5 demonstrates the 
bit error rate versus the signal to noise ratio 
(SNR) for TMTR-coded, EFMPlus coded and 
uncoded EPRII optical recording channels at

2.1=S . As shown both the 
TMTR-coded and EFMPlus-coded EPRII 
systems achieve better performance than the 
uncoded EPRII system. This is because both 
coded EPRII systems have a coding gain of 3 
dB when these modulation codes are considered 
in the 8-state trellis diagram of the EPRII 
system during detection. This leads to a coding 
gain of 3 dB. As also can be seen in this figure, 
the TMTR-coded EPRII system improves the
