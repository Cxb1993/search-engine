Abstract 
A theoretical prediction for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) in Al2O3:C by using 
UV (395nm) as a stimulation light source is demonstrated.  Modifications of localized transition 
between F and F+ center in the OSL excitation stage and two-trap competition model in OSL 
readout stage were considered in the simulation. Besides, this modified model also successfully 
describes UV bleaching effect in Al2O3:C dosimeter.  
 
Keywords: Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL); UV stimulation; Al2O3:C 
Introduction 
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) has been wildly studied in dose measurement due 
to its fast-readout and repeatable assessing advantage which were often compared with 
thermal-luminescence (TL) technique [1]. Therefore, OSL has brought new evolution in the field 
of real-time radiotherapy and dating dosimetry, such as archaeology and nuclear accident [2]. 
Besides, since the development of Al2O3:C with a low atomic number, less fading characteristics, 
and a stable signal under the room temperature, OSL had been broadly used in personnel and 
environmental dosimetry with Al2O3:C material [1]. 
    Principally, commercial Al2O3:C dosimeter usually follows one electron trap model in the 
OSL readout stage, e.g. LandauerTM Inlight system uses the green LED (530nm) to pump 
electrons into the dosimetric trap (or shallow trap) for dose measurement (“f1” only in Fig. 1 ) [3]; 
A Standard Risø OSL reader from demark even had equipped different stimulation light sources, 
such as IR (875nm), Green (530nm) and Blue (470nm) LEDs, and a testing of UV LEDs (395 nm) 
were also under investigation by Thomsen et al. (2008) [4].  
    However, photon energy of UV light (3.1ev) exceed the energy level of luminescence center 
(2.6ev, blue light emission). Another electron trap level (or deep electron trap level) should be 
taken into consideration for the OSL signal. Therefore, OSL in the UV stimulation should follow 
two-trap competition model instead of one trap model in the readout stage (“f1” and “f2” in Fig. 
1).

     For modified terms, Yukihara et al. (2003) had mentioned that if F-center accepted 206nm 
UV light, it would convert back to F+ center (F-center + 206 nm Æ F+-center + e-) [10]. Therefore, 
we assume that F-center (in non-radiative center, m2) would accept enough high energy from 
90Sr/+90Y radiation source and become F+-center (F-center + high energy (beta rays, 196~934Mev) 
Æ F+-center  +  e-). Therefore, “C1m2nc and  C1m2nc”  should  be  put  into  the  set  of  differential  
equations during the excitation stage where m2 is concentration of F-center and nc is electron 
concentration in the conduction band. Conversion rate C1 was  set  to  be  equal  to  C2 with an 
opposite sign and without energy loss. The initial concentration in this simulation is m1(0) = m10 
and n10=n20=m10=m20=0 because Al2O3:C dosimeter was recorded high dose at the beginning. The 
parameters inside the differential equation are set: M1=8×105 cmí3, M2=2.4×105 cmí3, N1=7×104 
cmí3, N2=3×104 cmí3, Am1=3×103 cm3 sí1, Am2 =5×100 cm3 sí1, B1=5×103 cm3 sí1, B2=4×102 cm3 
sí1, An1 =8×102 cm3 sí1, An2 =2×102 cm3 sí1, X=1.7×104 cmí3 sí1(which are proportional to 
Pagonis et al [6], table 1). The relaxation stage and readout stage in simulation are identical to R. 
Chen’s report [5]. The result of the glow curve simulation on Chip 101 is shown in fig.2 and 
roughly matches the data in Fig.2 when C1=C2=50.

Fig. 3. Simulation result of OSL in Al2O3:C by using UV (395nm) as a stimulation light source.  
(d=0% only the shallow trap in operation and d=100% means only the deep trap in operation) 
 
     The simulation results of UV as stimulation source are shown in Fig. 3. When “d=0%”, the 
result is again found in R. Chen’s paper [5]. When “d<50%”, two-trap competition occurs, the 
OSL intensity is still similar to the one trap stimulation. On the other hand, when the stimulation 
source changes from green LED (d=0%) to UV, the OSL in Al2O3:C will still maintain similar 
dose dependence on green LED (d=0%). “d>50%” case is a physical contradiction for the reason 
of that the pumping probability of a shallow trap is supposed to be larger than that of the deep 
trap (concentration ratio of n1/n2 is always bigger than one). In the extreme case “d=100%”, the 
shallow  trap  ran  out  of  electron  concentration  and  only  the  deep  trap  is  in  operation.  This  
phenomenon can only take place in the pre-bleaching process (The shallow trap had been 
bleached by pre-heating (TT-OSL) [12] or optical bleach before UV-stimulation OSL 
measurement). According to this theoretical prediction, pre-bleaching in the shallow trap seems to 
enlarge the linear dose dependence from 20Gy to 60 Gy in Al2O3:C dosimeter (Chip 101).
