Abstract 
In autumn of 2008, the chemical characteristics of major secondary ionic aerosols at a 
suburban site in central Taiwan were measured during an annually occurring season of high 
pollution using a semicontinuous measurement system. The semicontinuous measurement system 
measured major soluble inorganic species, including NH4
+, NO3
-, and SO4
2-, in PM10 with a 15 min 
resolution time. The atmospheric conditions, except for the influences of typhoons, were dominated 
by the local sea-land breeze with clear diurnal variations of meteorological parameters and air 
pollutant concentrations. Results showed that the daily maximum concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 
occurred several hours later than the daily maximum ozone concentration in daytime. To evaluate 
secondary aerosol formation at different ozone levels, daily ozone maximum concentration (O3, daily 
max) was used as an index of photochemical activity for dividing between the heavy polluted period 
(O3, daily max≧80 ppb) and the light polluted period (O3, daily max<80 ppb). The concentrations of PM10, 
NO3
-, SO4
2-, NH4
+ and total major ions during the heavy polluted period were 1.6, 1.9, 2.4, 2.7 and 
2.3 times the concentrations during the light polluted period, respectively. The concentration of 
sulfate increased the most among the total soluble ions in PM10. The average diurnal variations of 
NO3
-, SO4
2- and NH4
+ during the heavy polluted periods were different from those during the light 
polluted periods. The concentration peaks of PM10 during daytime might be related to the formation 
of secondary aerosol SO4
2- due to the similar peak time during light and heavy polluted periods. The 
highest concentrations of NO3
- and NH4
+ were observed near midnight during the heavy polluted 
periods, whereas high concentration values occurred in the rush hour during light polluted periods. 
A possible reason is that secondary pollutants formatted by photochemical reaction in inland urban 
areas were accumulated and transported slowly to the coastal area through sea-land breeze.

IV 
 The composition and reaction of secondary pollutants are very complex due to the various 
changes in aerosol characteristics. Understanding the temporal and spatial variations of physical and 
chemical characteristics for atmospheric aerosols is crucial (Kothai et al., 2008). However, most of 
the previous chemical analyses of aerosol source apportionment were based on the batch 
measurements’ relatively long sampling times, especially in Taiwan (Wang et al., 2008; Tseng et al., 
2009). The long sampling intervals could dilute the temporal impact of pollutant sources, making it 
difficult to separate the individual sources. The time resolution of the batch measurement is also 
usually not sufficient to explain the complex characteristics and rapid changes of aerosols in real 
atmosphere.  
In Taiwan, the high time-resolved measurements of aerosol chemical compositions are limited, 
especially for central Taiwan. This study investigated the chemical composition distributions of 
water-soluble inorganic ions with the influence of sea-land breeze on air quality. The variation of 
the concentration and the diurnal variation of mainly secondary aerosol compositions (i.e., 
ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate) and precursor pollutants were also analyzed. 
 
Experimental methods 
Sampling program 
Fig. 1 presents the geographical location of the Beishi sampling station (24”130, 120”340) in 
Shalu, Taichung, Taiwan. The sampling station is a suburban/coastal station on the western side of 
Tatu Hill and is about 9 km west of the Taiwan Strait. There is no obstruction around the sampling 
station. The immediate area is residential, with a heavy traffic expressway approximately 2 km east 
from the station. The Shalu, Taiwan, EPA air-quality monitoring station is located roughly 10 m 
northwest of the Beishi sampling station.  
The observational campaign was carried out from 9 September to 3 October 2008. Hourly 
meteorological data, mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, and concentrations of gaseous 
pollutants were obtained from the Shalu air-quality monitoring stations. Concentrations of 
water-soluble ions in PM10 were measured by the in situ ion chromatography (IC) system, with 15 
min sampling intervals. The eight water soluble ions, such as Cl-, NO2
-, NO3
-, SO4
2-, Na+, NH4
+, K+, 
and Ca2+ were determined during the 2008 autumn campaign. All data discussed in this work were 
under the no-rain condition. 
Instruments 
The particulate sampling apparatuses were placed on the roof of the Beishi junior high school, 
a four-story building (height is 15 m). The concentrations of water-soluble ions in PM10 were 
continuously measured by the in situ IC system at intervals of 15 min (Chang et al., 2006a, b, 2007). 
The measuring system has three parts: (1) pre-impactor and gas removal denuders, (2) aerosol 
collecting device, and (3) IC (Ion Chromatography, Model ICS-90, Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, 
YSA). The in situ IC system was operated at a total flow rate of 16.7 lmin-1 for a PM10 sampling 
inlet. After leaving the pre-impactor, the sampling flow was split into a 10 lmin-1 main flow and 6.7 
lmin-1 filter flow. The filter flow, which passes through the filter pack, was controlled by a mass 
flow controller. The ambient sample from the main flow line was drawn through the denuders to 
VI 
September. From 11–15 September and 27–29 September, central Taiwan was hit by typhoons 
Sinlaku and Jangmi. The diurnal variations of meteorological parameters and air pollutant 
concentrations disappeared. The weather was characterized by violent wind speed and low ambient 
temperature. The wind direction was determined by the location of the typhoon center. The bad air 
quality with higher PM10 concentration appeared in the front of the typhoon peripheral 
circumfluence (Fang et al., 2009). During 16 September through 23 September, the weather was 
influenced by the sea-land breeze with clear diurnal variations of meteorological parameters and air 
pollutant concentrations. The level of air pollutant was higher than the ambient air quality standard. 
However, the daily maximum concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were found several hours behind 
the daily maximum concentration of O3. In this paper, we excluded the influences of typhoons and 
considered the period from 16–23 September as a heavy polluted period (daily maximum O3 
concentration ≧ 80 ppb) and the periods from 9–10 and 23–26 September as light polluted 
periods (daily maximum O3 concentration < 80 ppb).  
The average global radiation was 400 Jm-2 during the light polluted period and 330 Jm-2 during 
the heavy polluted period. The average concentration of PM10 was 65.7 gm-3 during the light 
polluted period and 108.3 gm-3 during the heavy polluted period. The proportion of PM2.5 in 
PM10 was 43% in the light polluted period and 61% in the heavy polluted period, which indicated 
that the increased range of concentration of fine particles was higher than that of coarse particles in 
the heavy polluted period. Most of the fine particles were connected with the secondary aerosols, 
especially the anthropogenic ones (Lun et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2005). Results showed clearly that 
the radiative forcing to the ground was negatively correlated to aerosol concentration, especially for 
the fine aerosol. Previous studies have shown that secondary aerosols, mainly emitted from 
anthropogenic pollution, can affect global radiation (Lee and Sequeira, 2002; Chang and Park, 2004; 
Latha and Badarinath, 2005). 
Analysis of the concentration of nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium 
The hourly variations of major soluble ions (Fig. 3) were very similar to those of PM10 [Fig. 
2(d)], except during typhoons. Their concentrations were low on 9 and 10 September. On 11 
September, when a typhoon moved into Taiwan, the hourly concentration of PM10 sharply increased. 
In contrast, the hourly concentrations of major soluble ions fell. The primary reason was the 
resuspension of the river sand during dry season (Fang et al., 2009). The concentrations of PM10 
and the major soluble ions began to rise after the typhoon period. From midday of 23 September, 
central Taiwan was affected by the typhoon peripheral circumfluence. The concentrations of PM10 
and major soluble ions decreased. When the typhoon arrived on 27 September, the phenomena of 
higher PM10 and lower major soluble ions were repeated. 
The concentrations of PM10, NO3
-, SO4
2-, NH4
+, and the total major ions during the heavy 
polluted period were 1.6, 1.9, 2.4, 2.7 and 2.3 times the concentrations during the light polluted 
period, respectively (Table 1). The concentrations of the other soluble ions in PM10 were 
simultaneously measured. Results showed that the total concentrations of all soluble ions were 52.6 
and 30.2 gm-3 during the heavy and light polluted periods. Total concentration of all soluble ions 
increased 1.7 times during the heavy polluted period than in the light polluted period. The weak

polluted periods. 
The NO3
- and NH4
+ took on different diurnal variation patterns during the heavy and light 
polluted periods [Figs. 4(e) and (f)]. The diurnal cycles of NO3
- and NH4
+ demonstrated a single 
mode distribution during heavy polluted periods, with concentrations low during daytime and high 
at night. In contrast, the relatively unclear diurnal cycles of NO3
- and NH4
+ were observed during 
the light polluted periods, with concentrations low in the midday and high in the daily morning and 
evening rush hour. The lowest diurnal concentrations of NO3
- and NH4
+ were observed at noon both 
during the heavy and light polluted periods possibly because the evaporation of semi-volatile 
NH4NO3 was enhanced greatly under high temperature, and the development of the turbulence 
effect by sea breeze diluted the ambient pollutant concentrations. Low concentrations of precursor 
gaseous NO2 also limited the formation of secondary aerosol NO3
- during midday [Fig. 4(g)].  
The highest concentrations of NO3
- and NH4
+ were observed near midnight during the heavy 
polluted periods and in the rush hour during the light polluted periods. These differences depended 
not only on the evaporation of semi-volatile aerosols but also on the concentrations of precursor 
gases, the oxidation capacity in the atmosphere, and the transport of sea-land breeze. At night, the 
colder temperature and higher RH during the heavy polluted periods were conducive to partitioning 
the nitrate and ammonium toward the particulate phase. Fig. 4(g) shows that the concentrations of 
the precursor gaseous NO2 at night were higher during the heavy polluted periods than during the 
light polluted periods. The O3 concentration is an indicator to evaluating the oxidation capacity in 
the atmosphere. High concentrations of O3 [Fig. 4(c)] led to a high potential for the oxidation of 
precursor gaseous NO2 to secondary aerosol NO3
- during the heavy polluted period.  
When the dominant large-scale meteorology was easterly over the sea to the east of Taiwan, 
the Taichung area was on the lee side of the CMR, and the prevalent easterly wind was shielded. At 
the same time, aerosol distribution was mainly controlled by local meteorological phenomena in the 
Taichung area. Among these processes, the sea-land breeze played an important role in the transport 
and derivation of aerosols. The sea breeze began to blow onshore progressively as the temperature 
difference between sea and land increased. The air pollutants, mainly emitted from Taichung harbor, 
industrial parks, and power plants, were transported from the coastal area to the inland area and 
reacted with urban pollutants to form secondary aerosols in the daytime during the light and heavy 
polluted periods [Figs. 5(a) and (c)]. At night, the land surface temperature did not drop below sea 
temperature because of the heat-island effect, and the nocturnal winds were weaker than the 
daytime winds during the light and heavy polluted periods [Figs. 5(b) and (d)]. Fig. 4(h) shows that 
the average diurnal wind speed was lower during nighttime than daytime. Consequently, the 
formatted secondary pollutants by photochemical reaction in the inland urban area could be 
accumulated and transported slowly to the coastal area, which would explain the high 
concentrations of NH4
+ and NO3
- near midnight. 
Conclusions 
Air pollutants in central Taiwan frequently exceed air quality standards, affecting human health 
and damaged vegetation. The most extreme autumn pollution events in central Taiwan occurs when 
the synoptic flow is weaker or obstructed by topographic factors, which brings down the base of
