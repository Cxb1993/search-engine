graphite sheets in the cylindrical form [1]. Their electronic properties are extremely sensitive to the 
geometric structure. Only through changing their diameters and chiral angles, CNs can vary from being 
metallic to semiconducting.  SWCNs can be classified into three categories according to their energy 
gaps:[2, 3] (I) metals for m = n, (II) narrow-gap semiconductors for 2m + n = 3I and m ≠ n  (I  is an 
integer), and (III) moderate-gap semiconductors for 2m + n ≠ 3I, where (m, n) represents the chiral vector 
of a carbon nanotube [1]. The main difference between type-I and type-II SWCNs stems from the 
curvature effects. Furthermore, for type-II SWCNs, their energy gaps are of the order of 0.01 eV, which 
are inversely proportional to  the square of the radius, whereas those of type-III SWCNs are around  
1-0.1 eV and scale as the inverse of radius. These predicted energy gaps behaviors have been verified by 
the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [4-7]  and optical spectroscopy [8, 9]. 
 
 With the periodic boundary condition imposing on the electron wave function along the 
circumference, the azimuthal wave vector  is quantized and the two-dimensional graphene band 
structure would be sliced into a series of one-dimensional (1D) subbands.  This quantization results in 
CNs that are either 1D metals or semiconductors, depending on whether the allowed states intersect with 
the corner point of the hexagonal Brillouin zone or not.  It implies that CNs will exhibit 1D transport 
properties. Therefore, carrier scatterings will be seriously suppressed by the limited phase space available. 
Experimentally, scattering lengths up to several micrometers are reported in metallic nanotubes [10]. CNs 
are believed to be one of the most promising building blocks of the next-generation nanoelectronic 
technology [11, 12]. This is not only due to their small size but rather their overall electronic properties. 
The important features are the quantized ballistic transport, the coexistence of metallic and 
semiconducting behavior, and the availability of energy-gap modulation.

 With the application of a transverse electric field, the band structures of CNs would be strongly 
modified [13-16]. Band gap opening and closing had been predicted for zigzag CNs [16].  Moreover, the 
magnetic field would change the phase of the electron wave function, causing the band structure to

agreement with STM measurements [7]. Following their approach, the transfer integrals of armchair CNs

 At zero external field, the band structures are mirror symmetric about the Fermi level. For the type-I 
(10,10) CN, they are also symmetric about 3/Lz Rk =  (figures 1(a)-1(c); the length of the 
reciprocal-lattice). On the other hand, for the type-II (18,0) CN and the type-III (17,0) CN,  they are  
symmetric about . After switching on the external fields,  the type-I (10,10) CN is no longer

band structures of type-II and type-III  CNs become asymmetric about  0=zk   and the Fermi level 
(figures 1(f) and 1(i)), whereas those of type-I  CN  are independent of  φ   and remain symmetric 
about the Fermi level (figure 1(c)). Furthermore, a nonzero  φ   would  alter the postions of the 
band-edge states, enhance theenergy band bending, and cause the semiconductor-metal transition. The 
effects due to the nonovanishing φ   clearly illustrate that the azimuthal direction of the magneic field 
plays an important role on the electronic properties. 
 
The variations of   on the electric field strength F  and the magnetic field strength gE Bφ  at 
0== φθ   are shown in figures 2(a)-2(f). For the type-I (10,10) CN at a weak electric field, the energy 
gapstays initially at a constant value, which is determined by θ   and Bφ , then diminishes  
monotonically to zero with increasing F  when F exceeds the critical field ( ). Consequently,  type-I 
CNs become metallic for all 
cF
Bφ 's  at a sufficiently large electric field (figure 2(a)). When F is less than 
0.3 V/A, the energy gap grows  with  incrementing Bφ  . Furthermore, if F  is zero, its Bφ   
dependencewill be linear. For nonzero F, such dependencewill be nonlinear (figure 2(d)). The linear 
relationship between  and  gE Bφ  at zero F  can be derived analytically [35]. The energy gaps of the 
type-II (18,0) CN oscillate with F  and the semiconductor-metal transition occurs  for all Bφ 's   
(figure 2(b)). Moreover, the F  range, at which energy gap equals to zero, depends on  Bφ . Concerning 
Bφ   dependences, the energy gaps  decline to zero as Bφ   increases. If  F  is small, they rebound 
immediately. For F =0.2 V/A, the energy gaps  will stay at zero for a certain Bφ  range, then rise (figure 
2(e)). For the type-III (17,0) CN, the energy gaps grow gradually with  incrementing  F  initially, 
reach the maximum values and then decrease rapidly to zero. There will be band gap opening at large  F

Abstract
Electronic and transport properties of finite carbon nanotubes subject to the
influences of a transverse electric field and a magnetic field with varying polar
angles are studied by the tight-binding model. The external fields will modify
the state energies, destroy the state degeneracy, and modulate the energy gap.
Both the state energy and the energy gap exhibit rich dependence on the field
strength, the magnetic field direction, and the types of carbon nanotubes. The
semiconductor–metal transition would be allowed for certain field strengths and
magnetic field directions. The variations of state energies with the external fields
will also be reflected in the electrical and thermal conductance. The number, the
heights, and the positions of the conductance peaks are strongly dependent on
the external fields. The heights of the electrical and thermal conductance peaks
display a quantized behaviour, while that of the Peltier coefficient does not.
Finally, it is found that the validity of the Wiedemann–Franz law depends upon
the temperature, the field strength, the electronic structure, and the chemical
potential.
1. Introduction
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNs) are quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) systems
consisting of seamless graphene cylinders with nanometre-size radii [1]. They have been
extensively studied because of their unique electronic properties. Only through changing
their diameters and chiral angles can carbon nanotubes (CNs) vary from being metallic to
semiconducting. By cutting a long CN into segments, a quasi-zero-dimensional finite CN
is obtained. The scanning tunnelling microscope has been utilized to produce finite CNs
with length of a few tens of nanometres [2]. The reduction in dimensionality leads to many
interesting physical phenomena, e.g., quantized standing wave [3]; and novel magnetic [4] and
optical properties [5].

When a uniform magnetic field passes through a CN, the phase of the electron
wavefunction, which is determined by the vector potential, will be modified. The magnetic field
is assumed to have the polar angle α. Then the vector potential A equals φB cos α/2πrˆ +
φB sin α sin /πr zˆ, which will induce an extra phase factor exp(i2πGR/φB0) in the
Hamiltonian matrix element between site i and site j . GR =
∫ R j
Ri A · dl, φB = πr 2 B ,
and φB0 = hc/e is the magnetic flux quantum.
With the existence of external fields, we need to include all the carbon atoms in the finite
CN to construct the nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian, which is an NA × NA Hermitian matrix,

∑

ti, j (B)c†i c j , (1)
where 	i = −eFr cos θi is the onsite energy and ti, j is the transfer integral between lattice
locations i and j ; only hopping between the nearest neighbours is considered. c†i and ci are
the creation and annihilation operators at site i , respectively. The curvature effect is taken into
account by including Kane and Mele’s model [19] in assigning the values of ti, j s. Their model
successfully predicts energy gaps of narrow-gap CNs, which are in excellent agreement with
STM measurements [20, 21]. The details of determining ti, j s are given in [22].
After diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, the state energy Ec,v(F, φB , α) can be obtained.
The superscripts, c and v, represent the conduction bands and the valence bands, respectively.
With the inclusion of the Zeeman effect, the total state energy becomes Ec,v(F, φB , α; σ) =
Ec,v(F, φB , α) + gσφB/(m∗r 2φB0). The g factor is designated to be the same as that (∼2) of
graphite, where σ = ±1/2 is the electron spin and m∗ is the bare electron mass.
We consider a finite CN with a transverse electric field and a magnetic field with polar
angle α, which is suspended between two reservoirs (macroscopic leads). The left and right
reservoirs are assumed to have the chemical potentials and the temperatures (μ + eV , T )
and (μ, T + T ), respectively. In the ballistic regime, making use of the Landauer–Buttiker
formula, the net electric and thermal currents are, respectively, given by

semiconductor–metal transitions, and their heights are related to the number of states at the
Fermi level. At φB = 0, there are four peaks. The inclusion of a magnetic field will change the
number, positions and heights of the sharp peaks. The heights of the peaks display quantized
behaviour. At φB = 0, they are about two times those at φB = 0.2 regardless of the value of α.
The reason is as follow. At φB = 0, the spin-up and spin-down state energies are degenerate,
touching the Fermi level at the same F values, and they contribute equally to the electrical
conductance. A nonzero φB will shift the state energies and break the spin degeneracy. The
resulting states might or might not cross the Fermi level. If they do cross the Fermi level, the
original single peak will separate into two peaks with half of the height. The number of peaks
is maximum at α = 90◦.

field modifies the electronic structure, it does not change the number of edge states at the Fermi
energy, which is the only factor that determines the conductance.
The number, the heights, and the positions of the thermal conductance peaks are closely
corresponding to those of the electrical conductance (figures 3(a)–(d)). The special relationship
κ ≈ (π2k2B T/3e2)G, as discussed later in equation (12), is the main reason. The differences
in the shape and extent of the spikes between the electrical conductance and the thermal
conductance originate from the different integrands in equation (7). The integrand of L1
(equation (7)) is an antisymmetric function of E − μ. When μ = 0, the Peltier coefficient
will be identically zero. The computed Peltier coefficient at μ = 0.15γ0 is shown in
