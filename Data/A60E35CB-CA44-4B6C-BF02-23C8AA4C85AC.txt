Abstract 
This project undergoes quantitative analyses on fundamental properties of ad hoc networks 
including estimating the number of hidden-terminal pairs, the number of exposed-terminal sets, 
the number of neighboring nodes supporting triangle routes, and the extents of coverage and 
connectivity. To obtain these results, we propose a paradigm to systematically derive exact 
formulas for a great deal of subgraph probabilities of random geometric graphs. In contrast to 
previous work, which established asymptotic bounds or approximation, we obtain closed-form 
formulas that are fairly accurate and of practical value. 
Keywords: Ad hoc networks, sensor networks, analytical method, random geometric graphs, 
connectivity, coverage, performance evaluation, hidden terminal, exposed terminal, quantitative 
analysis 
1. Introduction 
A geometric graph G=(V, r) consists of nodes placed in 2-dimension space R2 and edge set 
E={(i, j)⏐d(i, j)≤r, where i, j∈V and d(i, j) denotes the Euclidian distance between node i and 
node j}. Let Χn={x1, x2, …, xn} be a set of independently and uniformly distributed random 
points. We use Ψ(Χn, r, A) to denote the random geometric graph (RGG) [29] of n nodes on Χn 
with radius r and placed in an area A. RGGs consider geometric graphs on random point 
configurations. Applications of RGGs include communications networks, classification, spatial 
statistics, epidemiology, astrophysics, and neural networks [29]. 
A RGG Ψ(Χn, r, A) is suitable to model an ad hoc network N=(n, r, A) consisting of n 
mobile devices with transmission radius r unit length that are independently and uniformly 
distributed at random in an area A. When each vertex in Ψ(Χn, r, A) represents a mobile device, 
each edge connecting two vertices represents a possible communication link as they are within 
the transmission range of each other. A random geometric graph and its representing network 
are shown in Figure 1. In the example, area A is a rectangle that is used to model the deployed 
area such as a meeting room. Area A, however, can be a circle, or any other shape, and even 
infinite space. 
The rest of this report is organized as follows. In Section 2, some definitions and notations 
are introduced. In Section 3, we briefly survey related results on RGGs. A method for 
computing the subgraph probability of RGGs with torus convention is presented in Section 4. 
Section 5 presents those derivations when confronting border effects. Finally, Section 6 
concludes the report. 
2. Definitions and notations 
A graph G=(V, E) consists of a finite nonempty vertex set V and edge set E of unordered 
pairs of distinct vertices of V. A graph G=(V, E) is labeled when the |V| vertices are 
distinguished from one another by names such as v1, v2, …, v|V|. Two labeled graphs G=(VG, EG) 
and H=(VH, EH) are identical, denoted by G=H if VG= VH and EG=EH. A graph H=(VH, EH) is a 
subgraph of G=(VG, EG) if VH⊆VG and EH⊆EG. Suppose that V′ is a nonempty subset of V. The 
subgraph of G=(V, E) whose vertex set is V′ and whose edge set is the set of those edges of G 
that have both ends in V′ is called the subgraph of G induced by V′, denoted by GV′. The size of 
any set S is denoted by |S|. The degree of a vertex v in graph G is the number of edge incident 
with v. The notation denotes the number of ways to select m from n distinct objects. ⎟⎟⎠

The subgraph probability of RGGs is defined as follows. Let Ω={G1, G2, …, Gk} represent 
every possible labeled graphs of Ψ(Χn, r, A), where k=2 . When Gx is a labeled subgraph in Ω, 
we use Pr(Gx) to denote the probability of the occurrence of Gx. Suppose S⊆V and T⊆V, we 
define Pr(Gs)= , when 1≤w≤k.

3. Related work in RGG 
To the best of our knowledge, previous results on RGGs are all asymptotic and approximate 
except [49, 50]. We summary related results as follows. 
A book written by Penrose [29] provides and explains the theory of random geometric graphs. 
Graph problems considered in the book include subgraph and component counts, vertex degrees, 
cliques and colorings, minimum degree, the largest component, partitioning problems, and 
connectivity and the number of components. 
For n points uniformly randomly distributed on a unit cube in d≥2 dimensions, Penrose [32] 
showed that the resulting geometric random graph G is k-connected and G has minimum degree 
k at the same time when n→∞. In [9, 10], Díaz et al. discussed many layout problems including 
minimum linear arrangement, cutwidth, sum cut, vertex separation, edge bisection, and vertex 
bisection in random geometric graphs. In [11], Díaz et al. considered the clique or chromatic 
number of random geometric graphs and their connectivity. 
Some results of RGGs can be applied to the connectivity problem of ad hoc networks. In 
[39], Santi and Blough discussed the connectivity problem of random geometric graphs Ψ(Χn, r, 
A), where A is a d-dimensional region with the same length size. In [1], Bettstetter investigated 
two fundamental characteristics of wireless networks: its minimum node degree and its 
k-connectivity. In [12], Dousse et al. obtained analytical expressions of the probability of 
Consequently, the false statement “two independent edges (i.e. (w, x) and (u, v)) are dependent” 
were true. A contradiction occurs. 
Note that Theorem 2 does not imply that the occurrences of more than two edges in RGGs 
are also independent. In fact, we will show their dependence later. 
By Theorem 1 and 2, we obtain the probability of two-edge subgraphs immediately. 
Corollary 3: For arbitrary two distinct edges ei=(u, v) and ej=(w, x) in a Ψ(Χn, r, A), we have 
Pr(EiEj)= (πr2/|A|)2. 
4.2 Base subgraphs 
In this subsection, we consider eight labeled subgraphs with three vertices as base 
subgraphs, the probabilities of which will be used to compute the probability of larger 
subgraphs later. Based on the number of edges included, subgraphs of three vertices can be 
classified into four groups: a triangle (c3), an induced path of length two (p2), an edge with an 
isolated vertex (p1+I1), and three isolated vertices (I3) (See Figure 2). 
p2 p2 p2 c3 
p1+I1 I3 p1+I1 p1+I1  
Figure 2. Eight base subgraphs. 
To compute the probability of c3, we need the following lemma. If one of two equal-sized 
circles in the place contains the center of the other, we call them two properly intersecting 
circles.

radius r is 2

We conclude that border effect does affect the value of the single edge probability of Ψ(Χn, 
r, A). If A is an l×m rectangle, the difference between the single edge probabilities with and 
without avoiding border effects (by adopting torus convention) is 22

6. Conclusions 
We have proposed a paradigm for computing the subgraph probabilities of RGGs, and have 
shown its applications in finding fundamental properties of wireless networks. We are surprised 
at finding some interesting properties: 
1. The occurrences of two distinct edges in RGG are independent. 
2. The occurrences of three or more distinct edges in RGG are dependent. 
3. Probabilities of some specific subgraphs in RGG can be estimated accurately. 
Many interesting subgraph probabilities and their applications in MANETs are still 
uncovered. For example, we are now interested in accurately estimating the diameter of RGGs. 
We also believe that the techniques developed in the report can be exploited to conduct 
quantitative analysis on other fundamental properties of wireless ad hoc networks.
