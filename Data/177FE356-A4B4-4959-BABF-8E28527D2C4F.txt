where USL and LSL are the upper and lower specification limits, respectively, µ  is the 
process mean, σ  is the process standard deviation and T  is the target value.  
The index pmkC  considered by Pearn et al. (1992) incorporates the yield-based 
index pkC  and the loss-based index pmC , taking into account the process yield (meeting 
the manufacturing specifications) as well as the process loss (variation from the target). 
The index pmkC , referred to as the third-generation capability index, has been defined as

where ( ) / 2d USL LSL= −  and ( ) / 2M USL LSL= +  are half-length and the midpoint of 
the specification interval [LSL, USL], respectively. When the process mean µ  departs 
from the target value T, the reduced value of pmkC  is more significant than those of pC , 
pkC  and pmC . Hence, the index pmkC  responds to the departure of the process mean µ  
from the target value T  faster than the other three basic indices pC , pkC  and pmC , 
while it remains sensitive to the changes of process variation.  
A process is said to have a symmetric tolerance if the target lies at the midpoint of 
the specification interval, i.e. T M= . When this is not the case, there are serious 
disadvantages in the casual use of PCIs. The situation that the target value is not set to the 
midpoint of the tolerance range, i.e. T M≠ , sometimes called as asymmetric tolerances. 
Asymmetric tolerances reflect that deviations from the target are less tolerable in one 
direction than in the other based on the customer’s point of view (see Wu and Tang 
(1998)). Although processes with symmetric tolerances are common in practical 
situations, asymmetric tolerances cases can also often occur in the manufacturing 
industries. Recent research and advances made in this subject are Choi and Owen (1990), 
Boyles (1994), Vännman (1997), Chen (1998), Jessenberger and Weihs (2000) and the 
more recent Pearn et al. (2006), and references therein. 
Asymmetric tolerances are usually not directly related to the shape of the supplier’s 
process distribution. They can arise in those situations where the tolerances are symmetric 
to begin with, but the process distribution is skewed or follows a non-normal distribution. 
In the literature, several authors including Boyles (1994) and Vännman (1997), have been

uD USL T= − , lD = T LSL−   and * min{ , }.u ld D D= Obviously, if T M=  (symmetric 
case), then * | |A A Tµ= = −  and pmkC′′  reduces to the original index .pmkC  We note 
that 0pmkC′′ ≥  for a process with mean µ  falling within the tolerance limits, as for the 
indices pmkC , pmkS , (0, 4)paC  and the yield-based index pkC . However, according to 
today’s modern quality improvement theories, reduction of variation from the target is 
just as important as meeting the manufacturing specifications. Thus, on-target would be a 
desired condition for a process. The factors A  and *A  ensure that the new 
generalization pmkC′′  obtains its maximal value at Tµ =  (process is on-target) regardless 
of whether the tolerances are symmetric (T M= ) or asymmetric (T M≠ ).  
Further, for processes E and F with E Fσ σ= , E Tµ > , F Tµ < , satisfying the 
relationship ( ) /E uT Dµ − = ( ) /F lT Dµ−  (i.e., processes E and F have equal departure 
ratio), the index values given to processes E and F are the same. In fact, the value of 
pmkC′′  decreases faster when µ  moves away from T  to the closer specification limit, 
and decreases slower when µ  moves away from T  to the farther specification limit. 
Therefore, pmkC′′  can accurately reflect the process capability. On the other hand, the 
upper bound on the departure ratio can be calculated as */ /(3 )A d d Cd d≤ +  for 
pmkC C′′ ≥ . The result indicates that for large value of pmkC′′  the process departure is small. 
We note that the departure ratio, / ( ) / uA d T Dµ= −  if Tµ ≥ , and / ( ) / lA d T Dµ= −  
if Tµ < . 
2.2. Estimation of the ′′pmkC  Index 
To estimate the generalization pmkC′′ , Pearn et al. (1999) considered the natural 
estimator ˆ pmkC′′  defined in the following:

replacing the process mean µ  and the process variance 2σ  by their conventional 
estimators x  and 2ns , which may be obtained from a stable process. If the manufacturing 
tolerance is symmetric, then *d d= , Aˆ *ˆ | |A x T= = − , and the estimator ˆ pmkC′′  reduces 
to 2 2 1/ 2ˆ ( | |) /{3[ ( ) ] }pmk nC d x M s x T= − − + − , the natural estimator of pmkC  considered 
by Pearn et al. (1992) for symmetric case. 
Pearn et al. (1999) derived the r-th moment of ˆ pmkC′′  without using the distribution 
of ˆ pmkC′′ . We note that the estimator ˆ pmkC′′  is biased. The magnitude of the bias is 
ˆ( )pmkBias C′′ ˆ( )pmkE C′′= pmkC′′− . The MSE can be expressed as ˆ( )pmkMSE C′′ ˆ( )pmkVar C′′= +  
2ˆ[ ( )]pmkBias C′′ , where ˆ( )pmkVar C′′  is the variance of ˆ pmkC′′ . 
The results indicated that the bias of ˆ pmkC′′  is positive when Tµ ≠ . That is, pmkC′′

2.4. Capability Requirements for the ′′pmkC  Index 
 For normally distributed process, the index pkS  (see Boyles (1994)) is a 
one-to-one transformation of fraction non-conforming. Since ( , ) ( , )pmk pkC Sµ σ µ σ′′ ≤  
= *( , /(3 ))pkS T d c  for all possible values of ( , )µ σ , we conclude that given a process 
with ( , )pmkC µ σ′′ = c , the fraction non-conforming PPM (parts per million) would be 
guaranteed to be less than that of a process with *( , /(3 ))pkS T d c , i.e.

Therefore, given the asymmetric factors rd , ld  and ud , the sample size n , the 
confidence level γ , the estimated value ˆ pmkC′′  and the parameter ξ , a lower confidence 
bound LC  can be obtained using a numerical integration technique with iterations, to 
solve the Equation (18). In practice, the parameter ξ  contains unknown parameters µ  
and σ , it can be estimated by the sample data as ˆ ( ) / nx T sξ = − . We note, in particular, 
that Equation (18) is an even function of ξ , provided T = M  (symmetric tolerance). 
Thus for 0ξ ξ=  and 0ξ ξ= − , we may obtain the same lower confidence bound under 
symmetric tolerances. 
Utilizing the definitions of ξ  and n , we may use the chi-square and the standard 
normal distributions to determine a critical value 0c  satisfying α =

-valuep  (the observed tail probability of the statistic ˆ pmkC′′  being at least as extreme as 
the particular observed value when 0H  is true) satisfying -valuep =  
*ˆ( | )pmk pmkP C c C C′′ ′′> = .  
3.1. Algorithm for Calculating a Lower Confidence Bound 
We may compute a lower confidence bound LC  by using Equation (18). An 
algorithm applying the technique called the binary search method is developed. And the 
accuracy of the calculation on the type I error 1 γ−  is set to 410− . Also an efficient 
Matlab computer program (available on request) executing the algorithm is developed, 
which incorporates three auxiliary functions for evaluating LC , including (a) the CDF of 
the chi-square 2 1nχ − , ( )KF ⋅ , (b) the PDF of the standard normal distribution (0,1)N , 
( )φ ⋅ , and (c) the function called “quad”, which numerically evaluate integral using the 
recursive adaptive Simpson quadrature. The Matlab program requires no more than 3 
CPU seconds for all samples sizes investigated, to compute the lower confidence bound 
values. We present the steps for calculating a lower confidence bound as follows. 
Algorithm for Calculating LC    
Step 1. Input the specification limits (LSL, T, USL), sample data 1 2( , ,..., )nx x x , 
sample size n  and the confidence level γ . 
Step 2. Calculation of the estimates x , ns , ξˆ  and ˆ pmkC′′ .

3.3. Discussion 
There are two methods to calculate the lower confidence bound LC  on pmkC′′ . 
Method I: Estimate the parameter ξ  by the sample data as ˆ ( ) /x T sξ = − , where 
1
/n iix x n==∑  is the sample mean and s =  2 1/ 21[ ( ) /( 1)]n ii x x n= − −∑  is the sample 
standard deviation. Method II: For practical purposes, we may set: (a) ξ  = 0.5 for 
l uD D> , (b) ξ  = 0.5−  for l uD D<  and (c) | |ξ  = 0.5 for l uD D=  in Equation (18) 
to calculate LC . A series of simulations for various parameters were undertaken to assess 
the effect of estimating ξ . For simplicity of the presentation, we only list the results of 
the coverage probability under / 3/ 2l ur D D= = , 0.05α = , 1pmkC′′ = , ξ = 
0.5− (0.5)1.5 for various n = 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, and a single simulation is 
replicated 1000N =  times. The average lower confidence bound and the coverage 
probability of the interval for each of the two methods were calculated and shown in 
Table 2.

3.4. Computation of the Lower Confidence Bound LC  
We implement the algorithm, and execute the Matlab program to calculate the lower 
confidence bound values LC  of ˆ pmkC′′  for γ =  0.95. Tables 3-4 tabulate LC  for n = 
5(5)200 and ˆ pmkC′′ = 0.7(0.1)3.0 under ( ld , ud ) = (2/3, 2/1) and (5/6, 5/4), respectively. 
To ensure the confidence level γ , we set ξ = 0.5 in Equation (18) to calculate LC  for 
the case l uD D> . For example, given γ =  0.95, ( ld , ud ) = (2/3, 2/1) and n  = 100, if 
the estimate ˆ pmkC′′  is 1.6, check Table 3(a) under the column ˆ pmkC′′ = 1.6 and the row n  
= 100 to find a lower confidence bound LC  = 1.300. We may then conclude that pmkC′′ ≥ 
1.300, and the confidence level is guaranteed to be no less than 0.95. 
4. Sample Size Determination 
Sample size determination is essential to most factory applications, particularly for 
those implementing a routine-basis data collection plan for monitoring and controlling 
process quality. It directly relates to the sampling cost of a data collection plan. We define 
the estimation precision pmkR = ˆ/L pmkC C′′ , then we have ˆL pmk pmkC R C′′= ⋅ . Hence, given 
the corresponding minimal precision of the estimation pmkR , the confidence level γ, the 
parameter ξ  and the estimate ˆ pmkC′′ , the sample size n  can be obtained by solving 
Equation (18) via numerical integration technique with iterations. It should be noted 
particularly, that Equation (18) is an even function of ξ , provided T = M  (symmetric 
tolerance). Thus, for both 0ξ ξ=  and 0ξ ξ= − , we may obtain the same sample size n for 
symmetric tolerances. 
4.1. Sample Size n and Parameter ξ  
We examine the behavior of the sample size n  against the unknown parameter ξ  
to study the effect on estimating ξ  in real applications. We perform extensive

0.70(0.05)0.90 (bottom to top). 
 
Thus, the level of confidence γ can be ensured, and the decisions made based on 
such approach are indeed more reliable. Discussion on sample size determination of 
pmkC  for symmetric tolerance also can be found in Franklin (1999). 
4.2. Computation of the Required Sample Size n  
To compute the required sample size n , we develop a Matlab program (available on 
request) using a simple linear search method. The accuracy of the calculation on the type 
I error is set to 0.005. The program reads the desired estimation precision pmkR  and the 
confidence level γ, and outputs the sample size n  required. Tables 5(a)-(b) displays the 
required sample size n  under ( ld , ud ) = (2/3, 2/1) and (5/6, 5/4), respectively, for 
pmkR  = 0.70(0.01)0.90 and γ = 0.95, 0.975, 0.99. To ensure the confidence level γ , we 
set ξ = 0.5 in Equation (18) to calculate n  for the case l uD D> . 
For example, the sample size n  = 109 is required for γ = 0.95 and ˆ pmkC′′ = 1.33 
under ( ld , ud ) = (2/3, 2/1), if estimation precision pmkR  is set to 0.82 (see Table 5(a)). 
That is, if the estimate ˆ pmkC′′ = 1.33, then the true value of pmkC′′  is no less than 1.33×0.82 
= 1.0906, with 95% confidence. Another application example is: given ( ld , ud ) = (5/6, 
5/4), ˆ pmkC′′  = 1.33, γ = 0.975, if sample size n = 100 is chosen, check Table 5(b) to give 
pmkR = 0.83. Thus, the true value of pmkC′′  is no less than ˆ pmkC′′ ⋅ pmkR =1.33 ⋅ 0.83 = 
1.1039, with 97.5% confidence. 
5. Application to Trench Capacitor Etch Processes 
To demonstrate how we may apply the proposed method to the real-word 
applications, we use data provided by a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) 
supplier, which uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) to monitor their DRAM devices at 
the shallow trench isolation and trench capacitor levels in production. DRAM is one of

rule will be: for given values of the risk α  and the sample size n , the process will be 
declared capable if LC  > 1.33 and incapable otherwise.

5.1. Capability Calculations and Data Analysis 
The collected sample data of size 100 are displayed in Table 6. Historical data based 
on routine process monitoring shows that the process is under statistical control. In this 
illustrative example, we have uD USL T= − = 36.0 − 30.0 = 6.0, lD = T − LSL = 
30.0−21.0 = 9.0, * min{ , }u ld D D=  = 6.0, d = (USL LSL− )/2 = 7.5, ld = / ld D  = 5/6 
and ud = / ud D = 5/4. If the measured “recess depth” falls outside specification limits, it is 
unacceptable. Figures 14-15 display the normal probability plot and the histogram with 
density line of the 100 observations, respectively. From these figures, the sample data 
appears to be normal. The validity of the normality also has been verified by using the 
Shapiro and Wilk (1965) W test.  
The calculated statistics are

/n iix x n==∑ = 30.152, 2 1/ 21[ ( ) / ]nn iis x x n== −∑ = 1.105, ˆ max{ ( ) / , ( ) / }u lA d x T D d T x D= − − = 0.19, * * *ˆ max{ ( ) / , ( ) / }u lA d x T D d T x D= − −  = 
0.152 and ˆ pmkC′′ = 1.739. Based on confidence level γ  = 0.95, ˆ pmkC′′ = 1.739, n = 100, a 
95% lower confidence bound of pmkC′′  can be found by solving Equation (18). We 
execute the Matlab program and obtain a lower confidence bound LC = 1.490 based on 
the collected sample, and therefore conclude that the true value of the process capability 
index pmkC′′  is no less than 1.490 with 95% level of confidence (or the type I error is no 
greater than 0.05). Furthermore, since LC = 1.490 > 1.33 = C, the null hypothesis 
“ 1.33pmkC′′ ≤ ” will be rejected at the significant level 0.05α = . We may claim that the 
process meets the capability requirement “ pmkC′′ >1.33” at least 95% confidence level, or 
equivalently, at the significant level 0.05α = . These product items conformed to the 
manufacturing specifications and are considered as reliable products.

to cover processes with asymmetric tolerances. They investigated the statistical properties 
of the natural estimator of pmkC′′  under the normality assumption, and derived several 
results including the PDF, CDF, r-th moment, expected value, variance and also analyzed 
the bias and MSE. However, the sampling distribution of ˆ pmkC′′  is mathematically 
intractable. This paper continued their work and developed an efficient algorithm to 
compute a lower confidence bound on pmkC′′ , which presents a measure on the minimum 
capability of the process, to enhance the applicability of the theoretical results. For 
symmetric tolerances case, a lower confidence bound on the original pmkC  index can 
also be obtained by setting ld = ud =1.  
To provide more quality protection to the customers and guarantees that the level of 
confidence is at least γ , we examined the behavior of the lower confidence bound values 
LC  against the process characteristic parameter ξ, and concluded that the lower 
confidence bound obtained its minimal value at (a) ξ  = 0.5 for l uD D> and (b) ξ  = 
0.5−  for l uD D< . For practical purpose we recommended to set (a) ξ  = 0.5 for 
l uD D>  and (b) ξ  = 0.5−  for l uD D<  to ensure the risk of making wrong decision 
will be no greater than the preset type I error 1 γ− . To make these results practical for 
in-plant applications, we tabulated the values of the lower confidence bounds for various 
common capability analysis situations. Furthermore, the sample size required to achieve a 
desired confidence limit with a specific confidence level have been studied and tabulated. 
An example on the trench capacitor etch process, taken from a DRAM supply company 
was presented to illustrate the practicality of the approach to actual data collected from 
the real-word applications.

報告內容： 
一、參加會議經過 
 
    此次於2009年七月六日至八日在馬來西亞吉隆坡  Parkroyal Hotal 所舉辦的
「International Conference on Business And Information 2009」學術研討會，我發表了兩篇近期
的研究想法與成果。第一篇是由我單獨發表，題目為：「非常態分配下的製程能力評估方法」。第
二篇是由我與逢甲大學工業工程與系統管理學系吳建瑋教授共同發表。發表的題目是：
「以貝氏方法建立非對稱允差規格製程能力檢定的決策法則」。這是我第一次以國科會
補助的經費，參加國際研討會。一方面可以藉此機會，參與國際間的學術活動交流，接
觸國際間相關領域的學者專家，另一方面可以在研討會中看到國際學者近期的研究方
向，藉此砥礪自己的研究思維。 
 
 
在第一篇論文中提到：用來建立製程績效真正的表現與製程規格之間關係的製程能
力指標，目前已經被證實能相當有效地衡量製程績效與能力。這些製程能力指標能同時
提供製程能力分析和品質保證兩個方面相當有效率的工具。製程能力指標基本上屬於使
用統計方法來測量製程能力，因此是建立於某些基礎的假設上面。舉例來說，我們所監
控的製程必須假設在穩定的狀態下，並且製程產出資料必須符合常態分配的假設。但是
實務上，這些基礎假設並非全然滿足。因佌，製程能力指標是否能真實地反應製程的績
效，這一點是頗具爭議的。Wright (1995) 提出一個新的製程能力指標 sC ，用來偵測製
程產出導因於分配之偏態所造成的變異。他的作法是：在既有的製程能力指標上，當分
配之偏態產生時，即對指標的運算作一扣分的動作。在本論文中，偏態係數對於 Wright
所提出新的製程能力指標 sC ，所造成的影響將被審慎地評估與研究。在製程產出分配
為偏態的劇本下，偏態係數對於製程能力指標 sC  的影響，我們將做完整的實驗設計與
模擬研究，藉以作出結論與報告。
