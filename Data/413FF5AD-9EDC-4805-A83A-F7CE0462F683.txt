Abstract—Lightweight en-route authentication is a challenging
task in wireless multi-hop networks. Without efficient defense
mechanism, an adversary can inject false data into the system,
incurring redundant message forwarding, consuming node power,
and degrading network performance. Unlike conventional ap-
proaches directly using message authentication codes (MAC),
we utilize Bloom filter techniques to build an authentication
manifest, which is called en-route authentication bitmap (EAB).
EAB helps nodes on the routing path to filter out false data in
high success rate, thus confine the injection attacks within the
one or two hops from the adversary. EAB can spend a few bytes
of bandwidth, whereas effectively protect the forwarding path
of tens of hops. Our scheme is suitable for resource-constrained
networks like WSN, PAN, MANET, etc.
Index Terms—Authentication, sensor networks, wireless com-
munication.
I. INTRODUCTION
Protecting the data integrity and authenticity from the source
to the destination is a challenging task in wireless multi-hop
networks. Typical multi-hop networks, like wireless sensor
networks (WSN) or mobile ad hoc networks(MANET), are
composed of multiple computing devices with constrained
energy and computation power. Thus, the usage of public-
key cryptographic operations should be limited for critical
situations.
Like many networking problem, the designers have to con-
sider the tradeoff between security and computation cost. Even
though the end-to-end authenticity is guaranteed by the shared
key between the source and the destination nodes (usually in
the form of MAC [1] or public-key signature), the intermediate
route nodes will not be able to verify the authenticity unless
extra information is provided.
Since data transmission in wireless environment is
broadcast-based, unnecessary message forwarding should be
avoided as much as it could. Every time a route node forwards
packets, its neighbored nodes will be forced to stay and
listen, even though they are neither the packet destination nor
routers. Worse yet, the packet transmission not just occupies
the channels among neighbors, also interferes more nodes in
near region. For instance, the two-hop away nodes compete
with each other for communication channel, similar to hidden
node problem.
Moreover, hop-by-hop routing exposes more entry points
for the adversary to attack the networks. The attacker may not
be able to fool the destination to accept false messages as long
as the two-end key is safely kept. Nevertheless, the attack can
inject false data into a routing path, inducing redundant traffic,
wasting route nodes’ computation power, and downgrading the
network performance. An naı¨ve solution to this problem is to
use network-wide authentication key. However, compromise
of a single node means compromise of the whole system. One
might adopt approach like μTESLA [2], which periodically
updates the authentication key. The disadvantage is that the
network must be synchronized within acceptable timing error.
When the routing paths get longer, it would be more difficult to
maintain time synchronization. Also, approaches like μTESLA
are designed mostly for central nodes such as base stations.
Another naı¨ve solution is making the source node attach
all message authentication code (MAC) for each router to the
data payload. Obviously, the message size will linearly expand
with the number of route nodes. Due to these difficulties,
it is desirable to have an effective and lightweight en-route
authentication scheme in multi-hop networks.
In this paper, we consider the problem of protecting message
authenticity hop-by-hop between two ends in a statistical
approach. In order to mitigate bandwidth usage, we aim at
filtering the false data along the routing path with increasing
probability. We append to legitimate messages with an extra
information, the en-route authentication bitmap (EAB), which
is constructed on the Bloom filter techniques. Our approach
can deter the attackers from injection bogus data since the
damage will be confined in its near neighborhood. With a few
statistical adaption, we can further improve the performance
and security. Our analysis shows that EAB can efficiently and
effectively stop bogus propagation over the networks.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. System Model
Notation is summarized in Table. I The wireless multi-
hop networks are consisted of a number of computing nodes.
Node can establish direct links to its neighbored nodes and
communicate with farther nodes by building a routing path
via intermediate nodes. It is possible that there exists one or
several server nodes with more powerful resources such as

Fig. 1. The En-route authentication bitmap is the Bloom filter taking MAC to each route node as entry set.
Then S packs the message:
M ′ ← {S|T |M |sig}. (2)
S will authenticate M ′ to each router Ri by an en-route
authentication bitmap(EAB). As in Figure 1, with the pairwise
key of S and each Ri, S computes the message authentication
code MAC(KS,Ri ,M ′) on M , respectively. That is,
EAB[x] =
{
1 ∃i∃j, x = Hj(MAC(KS,Ri ,M ′))
0 otherwise (3)
Then, using hash set H, it maps each MAC to the m-
bit filter, creating the EAB for this message along this path.
Finally, the packed message together with its EAB are sent to
the first route nodes.
Algorithm 1 Source Node Procedure
compute M ′ ← {S|T |M |sigS,T (M)}
clean EAB
for i = 1 to n do
bitmapi
Bloom←−−−− H,MAC(KS,Ri ,M ′)
EAB ⊕ bitmapi
end for
send out {M ′|EAB}
2) Destination Node: Trivially, the destination only verify
whether sigS, TM authenticates M .
3) Route Node: For every route node Ri receiving message
with the EAB BFS,R(M ′), it checks the following two
conditions:
• the number of marked bits in EAB falls in the range
[mp− δ, 	mp + δ
]. (4)
• ∀x′j = Hj(MACS,Ri(M ′)), bit x′j is marked in EAB.
By default, the δ is set to be
δ =
√
mp(1− p), (5)
where p is defined as in Equation (1). We will explain the
effect of δ in detail later.
If both conditions are satisfied, Ri will route the message
along with filter to the next router Ri+1. Otherwise, it filters
out the message and reports a false data has appeared. Detailed
description of the procedure is in Algorithm 2.
Algorithm 2 Route Node Ri Procedure
receive packet {M ′|EAB} from router Ri−1
if (mp− δ ≤ count(EAB) ≤ 	mp + δ
) then
for j = 1 to k do
compute x′j ← Hj(MACS,Ri(M ′))
if (EAB[x′j ] = 0) then
drop the packet
end if
end for
forward the packet to the next route Ri+1(or T )
else
drop the packet
end if
return
For example, in Figure 1, the source node builds a Bloom
filter of size m = 32 for the transmission over N = 8 route
nodes. Each MAC(KS,Ri ,M ′) maps to k = 3 marked bits in
EAB. The final EAB is the bit-wise AND of all mapping. On
average, the EAB will contain about 15 marked bits.

Fig. 4. The expected number of trials to find the desired EAB.
Before sending out message, S keeps try-and-error random
padding until the message M ′ results in an EAB whose
number of marked bits is no greater than β. β will be an
agreed parameter of the network system, recognized by all
route nodes. The trick is that the random padding allows the
source node to try out a series of EAB for the same message.
The source node can discard EAB which does not satisfy the
security threshold. In the same time, iterative testing should
be limited in acceptable times. Interestingly, a small padding
can help achieve both goals.
As for the route node, they change the behavior in line 2
of Algorithm 2 to
count(EAB) ≤ β (8)
In the light of binomial distribution, the expected times to
test out the satisfied EAB as Equation (8) is

(9)
For instance, see Figure 4, for m = 32, n = 8, and k = 3,
the source node is expected to get an EAB whose marked
bits is less than 13 (average is about 16) in about 19 trials,
whereby this EAB can filter bogus data within one hop by
94.73% and two hops by 99.72%. With padding of only 4-bit
in size, the probability failing to find such an EAB will be
less than 3.8 · 10−21.
B. Further Enhancement
Besides restraining the form of EAB, the same trick can help
enhance the filtering rate on the other side. By executing more
testing on random padding,the source could get an appropriate
EAB of less β and greater k in the same time.

See Figure 5. The optimal choice of k in standard Bloom
filters of m = 32 and n = 8 should be 3, so k = 4 will
increase the probability to pass through route nodes. The well-
selected EAB of β = 15 under k = 4 could have better
performance than that of smaller β under smaller k. But an
increased number of hash will certainly demand more padding
tests or even greater padding. How to decide these parameter
is depending on the network system’s requirements.

V. RELATED WORK
When asymmetric cryptography like digital signatures are
not appropriate, the end-to-end authentication is usually pro-
vided by message authentication codes (MACs). Most imple-
mentation of MACs are in the form of HMAC [5].
In wireless networks, hop-by-hop authentication is related to
the security primitive of broadcast authentication, especially
for WSNs. They differ in that broadcast authentication targets
at all nodes in the networks; while hop-by-hop authentication
serves for routing messages to a specific destination. Both
primitives can utilize each other. Hop-by-hop authentication
can guarantee the broadcast messages are delivered to every
destination. Broadcast authentication can protect the trans-
mission between hops since wireless networks are broadcast-
based.
Zhu et al. [6] present an interleaved hop-by-hop authenti-
cation scheme which guarantees that the sink node will detect
any injected false data packets when no more than a certain
number nodes are compromised. It require the destination
collaborating with its neighbors to combine their MACs.

Many authentication and key agreement protocols were proposed for protecting commu-
nicated messages. In previous protocols, if the user’s identity is transmitted in plaintext,
an adversary can tap the communications and employ it to launch some attacks. In most
protocols with user anonymity, they focus on satisfaction of several security requirements.
From a client’s point of view, those protocols are not admired since the cost of storage,
computation and communication is high. In pervasive computing, a client usually uses a
limited-resource device to access multiple servers. The storage and computation are very
important issues especially in this kind of environments. Also, for a convenience of design-
ing protocol, most protocols use timestamps to prevent the replay attack. As we know, the
serious time synchronization problem exists in timestamp-based protocols. Finally, most
protocols do not have formal proofs for the security. In this paper, we propose a secure
and eﬃcient identiﬁcation and key agreement protocol with user anonymity based on the
diﬃculty of cracking the elliptic curve Diﬃe–Hellman assumption. In addition, we also pro-
pose an augmented protocol for providing the explicit mutual authentication. Compared
with the related protocols, the proposed protocols’ computation cost is lower and the key
length is shorter. Therefore, our protocols are suitable even for applications in low power
computing environments. Finally, we formally prove the security of the proposed protocols
by employing the random oracle model.

1. Introduction
When users want to request services or to obtain data, they initiate a login phase with a service provider. Then they
authenticate each other and negotiate a common session key to protect the subsequent exchanged messages. Several known
methods are widely employed in current network applications for users identiﬁcation and key exchange, such as SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer) [1], Kerberos [2] and password-based AKE (Authenticated and Key Exchange) protocols [3–8]. However, several
drawbacks exist in the aforementioned protocols [1–8]. We introduce them as follows. First, a server has to maintain a
password or veriﬁcation ﬁle for identifying the validity of users. Second, a valid user has to maintain many secret tokens
for obtaining desired services from different service providers. Third, when a new server joins the system, a user’s secret
token has to be updated. Apart from the above drawbacks, the aforementioned protocols also do not address the privacy
issue of individuality since the identities of users are exposed over the public networks [9]. It also means that an adversary
could know and learn the participants of a conversation in those protocols. The identity anonymity should be a glamorous
security feature while a user requests or accesses a service.

2. After receiving the service request, the server computes K1 = T1 × Xs and uses it to compute DK1 (M1), and to get Uc
and Nonce1. Finally, the server looks up whether Uc exists in the public key table. If not, the service request is denied
and the connection is terminated; otherwise, the server selects a random number t2 and gets the client’s public key
PKc = Xc ×G from the public key table, where t2 < n. The server computes K2 = t2×PKc , K3 = Xs×PKc and T2 = t2×G .
The server computes M2 = EK2 (H(K3 ‖ Nonce1) ‖ Nonce2), where Nonce2 is a nonce chosen by the server. Finally, the
server sends T2 with M2 back to the client. The server also calculates the session key SK = H(Nonce1 ‖ Nonce2 ‖ K3).
3. The client computes K2 = T2× Xc and uses it to decrypt M2. Then the client calculates K3 = Xc ×PKs . If the digest value
of (K3 ‖ Nonce1) matches the ﬁrst part of the decrypted messages, the client authenticates the server and computes the
session key SK = H(Nonce1 ‖ Nonce2 ‖ K3). We use Fig. 1 to illustrate the SEIKA protocol.
2.3. Our protocol—SEIKA’
In fact, the SEIKA protocol only achieves a unilateral authentication: the client decrypts M2 to verify whether H(K3 ‖
Nonce1) is correct or not. The server has to employ later communications to authenticate the client. Therefore, we propose
a SEIKA’ protocol for providing the explicit mutual authentication between a client and a server.
Steps 1 and 2 of the SEIKA’ protocol are the same as the SEIKA protocol except that the server does not compute the
session key SK .
3′ . The client computes K2 = T2 × Xc and employs it to decrypt M2 and to calculate K3 = Xc ∗ PKs . If the hashed value
of (K3 ‖ Nonce1) exists in the decrypted message, the identity of the server is authenticated. Then the client sends
M3 = H(K3 ‖ Nonce2) to the server and computes the session key SK = H(Nonce1 ‖ Nonce2 ‖ K3).

query, B ﬁrst checks whether a record (M1, M2, K , C ) has been appeared before in the E-table. If the query has been
made, B returns M1 and M2 to A; otherwise, B returns two random numbers r1 and r2 to the adversary A and stores
(r1, r2, K , C ) into the E-table, where the lengths of r1 and r2 are equal-size to the hash function and Nonce∗2.
3.2. Security proof of SEIKA
In this subsection, we will prove that if an adversary A who wins a non-negligible advantage to break the system, then
another probabilistic and polynomial-time breaker B can create an environment and employ A’s advantage to solve any
given instance of the ECDH problem.
Assume that A is the probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine and the public data are prepared by B as its inputs.
A which produces a legal encrypted message (T2, M2) within a time-bound T can ask to the random oracles and to
obtain the honest transcripts. Without knowing the secret key, if the encrypted message (T2, M2) can be simulated with an
indistinguishable distribution probability, then the machine would be controlled by another machine B. By the advantage
of A, there are two valid encrypted messages ((T2,M2), (T2,M∗2)) produced such that H(K3 ‖ Nonce1) = H(K3 ‖ Nonce∗1).
Eventually, B will gain a non-negligible advantage to solve the ECDH problem by generating the point (Xc ∗ Xs ∗ G) and to
judge whether the point is involved in M2 and M∗2.
Theorem 1. The proposed SEIKA is (t,qse,qh,qen,qex, ε)-secure against existential forgery attack on adaptive chosen-message attacks
in the random oracle model if there is no probabilistic polynomial time adversary who can (t′, ε′)-break the ECDH (Elliptic Curve
Diﬃe–Hellman) problem, where ε′  ( 1qh (ε − 12l1 )( 12k + 12l2 +

qse2 (4tmul + 2tsymm) + qse3 (2tmul + tsymm) + qse2trn, tre denotes the time to relay a query, tmul denotes the time to process a point
multiplication, tsymm denotes the time to process a symmetric encryption and trn denotes the time to generate a random number.
Proof. We ﬁrst use Fig. 3 to illustrate the proof structure of this theorem. We assume that all the advantages of B are
obtained from A. We also assume that an adversary A can break the SEIKA protocol with a non-negligible advantage ε
after running at most t steps and making at most qse , qex , qen and qh queries. We will show that there exists an algorithm
B who can break the ECDH problem with a non-negligible advantage ε′ within a time bound t′ by taking A as a subroutine.
The objective of B is to obtain the point α(= α1 ∗ α2 ∗ G) by taking (n, G , F , C1 = α1 ∗ G , C2 = α2 ∗ G) as inputs.

3.3. Security proof of SEIKA’
Theorem 2. The proposed SEIKA’ is (t1 , qse, qh, qen, qex, ε1)-secure against existential forgery attack on adaptive chosen-message
attacks in the random oracle model if there is no probabilistic polynomial time adversary who can (t′1, ε′1)-break the ECDH problem,
where ε′1  (

)2

′
1  t1 + (qse + qex + qh)tre + qse3trn.
Proof. The security of the proposed SEIKA’ protocol depends on the security of the SEIKA protocol. We assume that an
adversary A1 can break the SEIKA’ protocol with a non-negligible advantage ε1 after running at most t1 steps and making
at most qse , qex , qen and qh queries. We will show that there exists an algorithm B1 who can break the ECDH problem with
an non-negligible advantage ε′1 within a time bound t′1 by taking A1 as a subroutine. The objective of B1 is to derive the
point (α1 ∗ α2 ∗ G) by taking (n, G , F , T1, T2, PKs , PKc) as inputs. The simulation is similar to Theorem 1.
Let QA1 be the event that A1 can forge a valid user to create a legal message = {M∗3} with a non-negligible probability
ε1 = ε (due to the above mentioned). Then we have Pr[QA1 ] = ε. Without querying the hash oracle, the probability of A1
correctly guessing the hash oracle value is not larger than 1
2l1
. We denote this event by N′H and Pr[N′H ] 12l1 . Necessarily,
we can have that the probability of A1 correctly outputting a legal forged message with H(K3 ‖ Nonce2) after making the
hash oracle query is Pr[QA1 ∧ ¬N′H ] ε − 12l1 .
Similar to the simulation of Theorem 1, if A1 have queried the oracles, then B1 has two chances to solve the ECDH
problem.
1. By the advantage of A1 outputting another valid forged message M∗3, B1 has the probability 1qh , where H(K3 ‖ Nonce2) =
H(K3 ‖ Nonce∗2).
2. The success probability of B1 in that A1 eventually outputs valid message M∗3 from the random tape is
(ε− 1
2l1
)2
4 .
Finally, we express the success probability of B1 solving the ECDH problem as follows:

4. Performance considerations
4.1. Eﬃciency comparison
In this subsection, we compare the computation cost of our protocols with the related protocols to evaluate our protocols.
Assume that TH denotes the time of one one-way hashing operation, TEXP denotes the time of one exponential operation,
TINV denotes the time of one modular inverse operation, TSYM denotes the time of one symmetric encryption or decryption,
TM denotes the time for one modular multiplication, and TECM denotes the time for the multiplication of a number over
an elliptic curve. We also use P1, P1′ , P2, P3, P4 and P5 to represent SEIKA, SEIKA’, SIKA [13], Lee–Chang’s protocol [10],
Wu–Hsu’s protocol [11] and Yang et al.’s protocol [12], respectively.
In the SEIKA protocol, the client’s computation costs are (2TECM + 1TSYM) in Step 1 and (1TH + 2TECM + 1TSYM) in Step 3.
The server’s computation costs are (1TECM + 1TSYM) and (1TH + 3TECM + 1TSYM) in Step 2. Finally, both of the client and the
server have to consume little power to compute SK = H(Nonce1 ‖ Nonce2 ‖ K3).
The computation cost of the SEIKA’ protocol is similar to the SEIKA protocol, except the client has to compute the
response H(K3 ‖ Nonce2) and the server has to verify it. We use Table 1 to show the comparisons among the related
protocols.
