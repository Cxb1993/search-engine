DFT domain. It performed well against both affine trans-
formations and low-quality JPEG compression. However,
the embedded templates can be removed to generate
peaks in a particular transform domain. Other methods in
this category apply the self-reference principle, based on
the auto-correlation function or the Fourier magnitude spec-
trum of a periodic watermark (Kutter [6] and
Voloshynovskiy et al. [7]). The results reveal that these
methods are robust against common geometric distortions
but not against low-quality JPEG compression.
The third category uses the features in the image as
reference points for both embedding and extracting a water-
mark. Numerous well-known feature-extracting approaches
have been presented, including, for example, the Harris
detector, the Achard-Rouquet detector and the Mexican
Hat wavelet scale interaction method. This resistance to
geometric distortions is achieved by geometrically trans-
forming a reference watermark based on the features in
the original image during the embedding process. During
the extraction, the features in the watermarked image, and
possibly those in the destroyed image, are used to geometri-
cally transform the reference watermark. Bas et al. [8]
employed principal component analysis to define geometric
transformation parameters. Bas et al. [9] and Kutter et al.
[10] utilised the corner points of the image as the features.
Nikolaidis and Pitas [11, 12] treated the facial feature points
as the features of the image. Tang and Hang [13] developed
a method of combining feature extraction and image nor-
malisation to resist geometric distortions, while partially
solving the watermark synchronisation problem. However,
these methods depend on the features of the individual
images. The embedding method may not be appropriate
for all images.
The final category applies exact histogram specifications
in robust watermarking. The use of image histograms as
watermarks has been investigated in recent years [14–16].
Coltuc and Bolon [14] utilised exact histogram specification
to mark images. An exact histogram-specification algor-
ithm, based on combining a statistical model of the
images and the lattice structure that is assumed on the
basis of discrete images, was proposed. This method is
resistant to various common image attacks. Chareyron
et al. [15] extended the histogram-specification method pro-
posed by Coltuc and Bolon [14] to chromatic histograms,
and then to colour (3D) histograms. The method embeds a
watermark in the xy chromatic plane of the colour image.
This method aims to resist geometric distortion and crop-
ping. A special pattern generated using a secret key is
used to modify the chromatic distribution of the image.
Then, the chromatic values associated with the pattern are
modified to embed the watermark. Experimental results
show that this watermark strategy resists a change in
scaling and cropping.
This investigation presents a blind watermarking algor-
ithm that is based on a three-dimensional colour histogram
of the features of the pixels in a cover image. The histo-
gram distribution of an image is approximately invariant
under geometric attack, so this investigation develops a
novel scheme for measuring the numerous features of all
pixels in an image, for dynamically grouping all pixels
into several blocks according to the distribution of pixel
features and for modifying a single feature value of some
pixels in a block to generate a special histogram distri-
bution, which is employed to embed a watermarking data
bit. The robust watermarking scheme is called the
Histogram-Oriented Watermarking Algorithm (HOWA)
because the histogram distribution is approximately
invariant under attack.
2 Embedding by HOWA
The proposed embedding algorithm comprises four main
steps. The first measures the features of all the pixels in
the cover image. The second groups all pixels into several
blocks on the basis of on their features where the number
of blocks equals or exceeds the number of watermarking
data bits. The third, generates embedding data using a
secret key. Finally, the fourth moves some pixels in a
block to form a specified pattern in the histogram
distribution and thereby embeds a watermarking data bit.
The methodologies associated with the aforementioned
four steps are described before the embedding algorithm
is presented.
In step 1, numerous features of all pixels in the cover
image are measured. In this step, the cover image I of
size M  N is loaded. I(x, y) indicates that the pixel
located at position (x, y) is associated with the three
primary colour values R(x, y), G(x, y) and B(x, y) of the
RGB colour model, where 0  x  M2 1, 0  y  N2 1.
The measurement in this step is made as follows.
1. All R(x, y), G(x, y) and B(x, y) are transformed into
Y(x, y), U(x, y) and V(x, y) of the YUV colour model.
2. The average values of Y(x, y) and V(x, y) are obtained
from the values of Yf (x, y) and Vf (x, y) of the pixels
around pixel I(x, y), using the following equation
for all x; y and 0  x  M  1; 0  y  N  1
for all i; j; i2 þ j2  R2 and 0  xþ i  M  1;
0  yþ j  N  1

where R denotes the radius of the set of pixels around (x, y)
and NR represents the number of pixels in the circle.
In the proposed method, R is 16 and NR is 797. Many
studies [17–19] have proven that modifications in the chro-
matic values in the blue subband are less perceptible to
humans than are modifications in other subbands. U(x, y)
is modified to embed the watermark; Y(x, y) and V(x, y)
are selected to calculate new features Yf (x, y) and Vf (x, y),
using a circular smoothing filter in (1). Yf (x, y) and Vf (x, y)
are calculated to be reference features, and the original
Y(x, y) and V(x, y) are unchanged. Accordingly, the filter
radius R in (1) does not influence the quality of the water-
marked image. JPEG compression can be regarded as a
low-pass filter. It eliminates major high-frequency signals
of an image. Some adaptive filters in Lee et al. [20] and
Pham and van Vliet [21] are designed to reduce effectively
blocking artifacts of the JPEG image. The smoothing filter
in (1) is designed and adopted to reduce effectively the varia-
bility of the coefficients of Y(x, y) and V(x, y) in response to
JPEG compression attacks with different quality factors.
After (1) is applied, the coefficients of Yf (x, y) and Vf (x, y)
become more stable under JPEG attacks with various
quality factors. Therefore during the step in which embed-
ding blocks are generated, the range of each embedding
block Bijk, segmented by features Yf (x, y) and Vf (x, y)
without JPEG compression, is approximately identical to
the range of the corresponding Bi 0j 0k 0 segmented by features
Yf
0(x, y) and Vf0(x, y) under JPEG compression attacks with
different quality factors, where i ¼ i0, j ¼ j0 and k ¼ k0.

Step 4 completes the embedding. In this process, Nb bits
of embedding data W are embedded into Nb blocks. A very
simple embedding approach is used herein. Some pixels are
moved from one sub-block to another to make a special
histogram distribution that indicates the embedded water-
marking data. The U values of some pixels in a sub-block
are modified to group them into another sub-block, which
forms a special histogram distribution and thereby moves
the pixels. The process is detailed as follows.
Let NSA þ NSB ¼ 2C. W(l ), the lth watermarking data bit
is embedded into Bijk, 0  l  p  q  r2 1, i ¼ bl/qrc,
j ¼ b(l2 iqr)/rc, k ¼ l2 iqr2 jr, where i, j and k are the
indices of the embedding blocks and b.c indicates down-
ward truncation.
When W(l ) ¼ 1, some pixels in SB and SC are moved
into SA and SD, respectively, to satisfy (4)
NSA ¼ NSD  ð1 þ aÞC
NSB ¼ NSC  ð1  aÞC

ð4Þ
If W(l ) ¼ 0, the same process is performed in reverse to
satisfy (5)
NSA ¼ NSD  ð1 þ aÞC
NSB ¼ NSC  ð1  aÞC

ð5Þ
The variable a specifies the robustness of watermark,
0  a  1, and it indicates the ratio of the number of
pixels moved to the number of pixels in a single sub-
block. When a ¼ 1, all pixels in SB and SC are moved to
SA and SD, respectively. The watermark is more robust
when a is larger, but some of the regions of the water-
marked image may be visibly modified. This investigation
sets two margin values, Ul 0 and Uh0, based on (6), to cause
a pixel to move unambiguously from one sub-block to
another in order to resist JPEG compression attack
Ul0 ¼ Um  bðUm  UlÞ
Uh0 ¼ Um þ bðUh  UmÞ

ð6Þ
b is the variable that specifies the resistance to JPEG attack;
0  b  1, and the boundary among the sub-blocks
becomes clearer as b increases. However, modifying the
pixels may visibly distort the colours.
Embedding a watermark by moving the pixels around
those sub-blocks will not move the pixels from a certain
embedding block to another. HOWA moves the pixels to
change the interior histogram distribution of a single
embedding block, but will not influence the mutual relation-
ship between embedding blocks. Therefore the embedding
blocks’ generation is not influenced by watermark embed-
ding. Fig. 4 shows the feature U’s histograms of six embed-
ding blocks before and after the embedding of a watermark,
to demonstrate that the quality of the image will not be
severely reduced by the modifications associated with
embedding a watermark in HOWA. The histogram distri-
butions of the six embedding blocks that are associated
with larger modifications of U coefficients of all embedding
blocks are presented. Consequently, the U histogram distri-
bution of each embedding block is very concentrated. The
modification of the U coefficients required to embed a
single watermark bit is under 10% of U range,
0  U  240, and can be made by controlling the factors
a and b. Hence, the distortion of the histogram distribution
does not seriously influence the quality of the image, and
the slight distortion of the colour subband in an image is
imperceptible to the human eye. Section 4 will discuss
how a and b affect the objective image quality.

image are grouped into 16 planes, 32 bands and 128 blocks,
for p ¼ 16, q ¼ 2 and r ¼ 4. Accordingly, 128 bits of data
are embedded. The value R is used to measure the values of
features Yf and Vf to help resist JPEG attack. As is well
known, a in (4) and (5) represents the robustness of
watermarking, and b in (6) represents the strength required
to resist JPEG attack. This investigation embeds 128 bits of
data into 100 test images with different values of a, b and R,
to obtain the proper values of a, b and R, and examines the
average number of correct bits that are extracted from the
watermarked image under rotation by 108 (auto-scale,
auto-crop) and JPEG compression with a quality factor of
50. Fig. 7 presents the results, and Fig. 7a shows that a
larger a corresponds to more correct bits, but may
become saturated when a exceeds 0.7. Fig. 7b reveals that
the appropriate value of b is 0.5. Fig. 7c reveals that the
increasing parameter R enhances the resistance to JPEG
attacks, but degrades resistance to rotation attacks,
because rotation attacks typically involve auto-cropping
and auto-scaling. Hence, if a larger parameter R is used in
(1), then more coefficients of Y(x, y) and V(x, y) are
wrongly positioned, degrading the resistance to rotation
attacks. Fig. 7c shows that the preferred value of R is 16.
The U values of some pixels are modified to yield a
special histogram distribution to embed a single embedding
data bit. Hence, the decision regarding which bit should be
embedded is based on the special histogram distribution of
feature U. However, in an image without an embedded
watermark, a single watermark data bit can still be extracted
from a block, based on the histogram distribution of feature
U, and the average correct rate is approximately 50%.
A threshold value T must therefore be defined to prevent
false alarms. The probability that the number of bits is cor-
rectly extracted from an un-watermarked image must be
reduced below T. The probability of a false alarm in n
bits of embedded watermark data is given by (7) [13]
Pfalse-alarm ¼
Xn
i¼T
1

 n
 n!

 
ð7Þ
where n is 128; the false alarm probability is less than 1025,
and the threshold value, T, exceeds 89. Accordingly, in this
investigation, the threshold is set to 89 to judge whether the
watermark data are successfully extracted from an image.
The values of the parameters for embedding 128 bits of
data are p ¼ 16, q ¼ 2, r ¼ 4, a ¼ 0.7, b ¼ 0.5, R ¼ 16,
NR ¼ 797 and T ¼ 89. Fig. 8 shows the original six main
test images, and Fig. 9 shows the results obtained by embed-
ding 128 bits of data. Table 1 presents the average PSNRs of
the six watermarked images to evaluate objectively the
effect of a and b on the quality of a watermarked image.
The total PSNR of colour components, Y, U and V are
defined using the following (8) [22]
