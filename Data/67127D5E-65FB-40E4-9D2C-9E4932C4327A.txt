Newtonian non-inertia flow, the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses
and fluid inertia forces on the squeeze film characteristics are displayed for various
Reynolds numbers and couple stress parameters. The results of the present project
provide industrial engineers useful information in designing and improving the
squeeze film mechanism of long partial journal-bearing squeeze film systems.

1. Introduction
Squeeze film mechanisms are often observed in many areas of engineering science.
By the use of Newtonian lubricants, representative researches are presented in the
squeeze-film parallel plates by Archibald [1] and Jones and Wilson [2]; the
squeeze-film parallel disks by Murti [3] and Gupta and Vora [4]; the squeeze-film
cylinder-plate bearings by Dowson [5]; the squeeze-film sphere-plate bearings by
Conway and Lee [6], and the squeeze-film journal bearings by Hamrock [7]. Recently,
the wide use of a Newtonian fluid blended with different types of high molecular
weight polymer additives has received great attention. To describe the flow behavior
of these kinds of non-Newtonian lubricants, a micro-continuum theory considering the
particle size effects of fluids has been developed by Stokes [8].
Grounded on the Stokes micro-continuum theory, typical squeeze-film problems
are analyzed in the parallel plates by Ramanaiah [9]; the parallel disks by Ramanaiah
and Sarkar [10]; the cylinder-plate bearings by Bujurke and Jayaraman [11] and Lin
[12]; the sphere-plate bearings by Lin [13] and Elsharkawy and AL-Fadhalah [14];
and the squeeze-film journal bearings by Lin [15] and Naduvinamani et al. [16].
However, the above researches concerning with couple-stress squeeze-film motions
have omitted the effects of fluid inertia forces. Since the fluid velocity may change the
squeeze film pressure, the fluid inertia forces of the lubricant should be included in
the investigation of squeeze film motions.
On the basis of the micro-continuum theory together with the averaged inertia
principle, the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses and convective fluid
inertia forces on the squeeze film performance of long partial journal bearings are
investigated. The lubrication equation considering the couple stress effects arising
from the base oil blended with various types of additives is derived from Stokes
couple-stress motion equations and the continuity equation. The classical non-inertia
4velocity component is obtained.

The load-carrying capacity LW per unit width can be evaluated by integrating the
6the squeeze-film Reynolds number Re . The effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses
are seen to provide an increase in the response time. Since the couple stress effects
( 25.0L ) yield a higher load-carrying capacity, a lower  would be expected for
the same response time to be taken as compared to the Newtonian-lubricant case.
Moreover, since the inertia forces effects result in a higher W , a longer response time
is observed for the squeeze film as compared to the non-inertial case ( 0Re ). On the
whole, the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses and fluid inertia forces
upon the squeeze film motion are apparent. The response times of the long partial
journal-bearing system are significantly lengthened by the use of non-Newtonian
couple stress fluids and by considering the effects of fluid inertia forces.
5. Conclusions
On the basis of the Stokes micro-continuum theory together with the averaged
momentum integral principle, the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses
and convective fluid inertia forces upon the squeeze film characteristics of a long
partial journal bearing have been investigated. According to the results and discussion,
conclusions can be drawn as follows.
A closed-form solution for the squeeze film pressure, the load capacity and the
response time has been derived for the long partial journal-bearing squeeze-film
system. Comparing with the non-inertia Newtonian-lubricant case, the combined
effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses and convective inertia forces increase the
squeeze film pressure, the load-carrying capacity as well as the response time of the
squeeze film bearing. On the whole, the quantitative effects of non-Newtonian couple
stresses and convective inertia forces upon the improved squeeze film characteristics
are more emphasized for higher values of the non-Newtonian couple stress parameter,
the squeeze-film Reynolds number and the eccentricity ratio of long partial
journal-bearing squeeze-film system. The results obtained from the present study
provide useful information for industrial engineers in designing the long partial
journal-bearing squeeze-film mechanisms.

技術說明
中文：
擠壓膜機制廣泛應用於工業實務與工程科學上。傳統上，擠壓
膜軸承之設計與分析常採用牛頓流體潤滑劑並忽略流體慣性力。由
於現代精密機械之發展，針對系統需要使用少量添加劑混合於牛頓
流體滑劑中顯得相當重要。此外，當擠壓膜機制在運動程序中之速
度漸高時，流體慣性力便逐漸重要而不可忽略。因此，擠壓膜軸承
機制之設計與分析必須額外再考慮流體之慣性力效應與非牛頓之
流變效應。
本技術成果即在提供偏頸軸承擠壓膜系統，在同時考慮流體慣
性力與非牛頓流變之複合效應下的擠壓膜性能技術。根據史托克氏
(Stokes)之微連體理論配合動量平均近似法，在不同擠壓雷諾數與非
牛頓偶應力參數值下，展現擠壓膜系統(包含擠壓膜壓力，負荷能
力，響應時間等)之擠壓膜特性。此技術成果，可做為企業界設計與
改良偏頸軸承系統在考慮流體慣性力效應並顧及非牛頓流變效應
時，一個非常重要之設計參考依據。
