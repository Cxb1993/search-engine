Abstract 
   In the project of this year, we propose a novel shadow compensation approach for face 
recognition under varying illumination. This approach based on facial symmetry and image average 
can solve the drawbacks of the conventional algorithms such as histogram equalization (HE) and 
region-based histogram equalization (RHE). Among others, the proposed approach has the 
following advantages: (1) it is very simple, so it is easily implemented in a real-time face 
recognition system; (2) it is able to reinforce key facial features and to standardize other parts of the 
face; and (3) it can apply directly to single face image without any prior information of light source 
direction. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach has a rather excellent 
recognition performance.

一、簡介 
   Human face recognition, as one of the primary biometric technologies, became more and more 
important due to increased demands on security, such as criminal identification, identity verification 
for credit card or passport, access control, intelligent surveillance, and so on. However, since the 
intra-person variations caused by illumination change are often larger than the inter-person 
differences [1], illumination-robust face recognition is still a challenging problem [2,3]. Recently, 
numerous different approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem. Basically, these 
approaches can be classified into three main categories [4-6]: preprocessing and normalization, 
invariant feature extraction, and face modeling. 
 
   In the first category (preprocessing and normalization), some image processing techniques have 
been presented to alleviate the effect of uneven illumination of face image before performing 
feature extraction procedure. One of the most well-known preprocessing methods is histogram 
equalization (HE), which can uniform the distribution of luminance value of an image. In other 
words, the HE is considered to optimize the contrast of an image. In addition to HE, several 
modified HE techniques have also been introduced to cope with illumination variations, such as 
region-based histogram equalization (RHE) [7], block-based histogram equalization (BHE) [8], and 
etc. The main idea of RHE is to execute HE independently in some pre-defined image regions 
partitioned from the original face image, so as to increase the local contrast and to reinforce the 
local information such as textures and edges. Nevertheless, the significant difference between the 
pixels at the edge of adjacent regions is generated after performing RHE process. In order to solve 
this problem, the BHE is actually to carry out HE in pre-defined image blocks, which overlap half 
with each other. However, the computational requirement of BHE is much higher than that of RHE 
and noises are also enhanced after performing BHE. More recently, in order to deal with 
illumination variation in face image, Song et al. [9] proposed the mirror image method, which is 
based on the assumption of facial symmetry. More specifically, this method is first to divide the 
original face image into left face image and right face image. In the second step, the luminance 
difference between left and right face images is computed. When this luminance difference is bigger 
than a pre-defined threshold value, the mirror image is produced by mirroring the brighter half face 
image. Nevertheless, since the mirror-image method only considers the illumination variation 
caused by left/right light source direction, it cannot handle the illumination variation caused by 
other light source directions. For instance, when the light source direction is 80 degree of angle of 
elevation against front face, the luminance difference between left and right face images is almost 
equal to zero. In other words, the mirror-image method will not do any further process for this case. 
 
   In the second category (invariant feature extraction), many algorithms have been presented to 
extract facial features which are invariant to illumination variations. As an example, Shashua and 
Riklin-Raviv [10] introduced the quotient image (QI) method, which is based on the ratio of the 
albedo of two objects. This quotient image is regarded as the illumination invariant signature image, 
 3
whether using principal component analysis (PCA) [18] or two-dimensional PCA (2DPCA) [19,20] 
as a feature extraction method, is significantly improved by carrying out our approach. 
 
   The rest of this report is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed approach for 
shadow compensation of face image. Experimental results and discussion are presented in Section 3. 
Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 4.    
 
二、研究方法 
   In this section, we provide a detailed description on MR-HEIA approach. Firstly, in order to 
enhance the local contrast, the MR-HEIA performs HE in pre-defined mirror-regions which are 
generated by dividing the original face image along the direction paralleled the symmetric axis of 
the face. More specifically, suppose that I  denotes a face image of a person and K  denotes the 
number of divided mirror-regions of half face image. That is to say, a face image has K2  
mirror-regions in total. Further, each mirror-region in left face image is expressed as iLI   with 
Ki ,,2,1 L= , where i  denotes the position of the mirror-region in half face image and increases 
progressively from the border of the face image to its center. Similarly, each mirror-region in right 
face image is expressed as iRI   with Ki ,,2,1 L= . Fig.1 shows an example of mirror-region 
partition with 2=K . 
 
 
Fig. 1. An example of mirror-region partition with 2=K . 
 
 
   After the first step of MR-HEIA, we obtain K2  enhanced mirror-regions, and each of them in 
left and right face image is expressed as iLI  ˆ  and iRI  ˆ , respectively, where Ki ,,2,1 L= . Figs. 2(a) 
and (b) show some face images which are severely affected by uneven illumination and 
corresponding enhanced face images under using 2=K , respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 
2(b), the facial features of face images are reinforced, but the shortcoming similar to RHE still 
exists. In order to make up for this shortcoming and preserve the enhanced facial features at the 
same time, the image average concept proposed by Jenkins et al. [21] is introduced into our 
approach. In Ref. [21], Jenkins et al. indicated that averaging different face images of the same 
 5
However, the image average method cannot bring its ability into full play for diluting the variations 
because the average image is only computed by two mirror-regions (i.e., enhanced mirror-region 
and corresponding mirror version). Hence, we propose a modified image average method which is 
more suitable to the situation faced at present and describe it as follows. In view of the local region 
of a face image, the values of the gray-level intensity of the facial features (such as eyebrows, eyes, 
and mouth), whether light source direction is center or not, are usually lower than that of other parts 
of the local region. Further, due to the action of HE on the local region, the luminance of the facial 
feature becomes darker but opposite in other parts of the local region. This means that the pixel 
value sum of the non-facial features of the same position when computing the average image of two 
mirror-regions (i.e., enhanced mirror-region and corresponding mirror version) is usually over 255. 
Consequently, take this property into account, the modified average image is computed as shown 
below:

Through above process, the facial features can be reinforced and other parts of the face can be 
standardized. Then, the compensated face image used for face recognition is acquired by mirroring 
the modified average image. Fig. 2(c) shows some compensated face images, which are obtained by 
performing MR-HEIA on the face images as shown in Fig. 2(a). 
 
   Finally, in face recognition procedures, the PCA and the 2DPCA are utilized, respectively, for 
feature extraction, and then the nearest neighbor classifier based on the Euclidean distance is 
employed for classification. Fig. 3 shows the system block diagram of MR-HEIA for understanding 
the overall procedure more clearly. Since we mainly focus on shadow compensation of face image, 
the details on the face recognition procedures will not be discussed in this report. See Refs. [18-20] 
for more details. 
 
三、實驗結果與討論 
   In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach based on two public face 
databases: Yale B face database [15,23] and Weizmann face database [24]. In the experiments, all 
images are manually cropped and aligned in compliance with Ref. [15]. Specifically, the distance 
between eyes is equal to four sevenths of the cropped window width and the face was centered 
along the vertical orientation so that the two imaginary horizontal lines passing through the eyes 
and mouth are equidistant from the center of the cropped window. Subsequently, all face images are 
resized to a size of 112×92 pixels.

Fig. 4. Example images of a subject in Yale B database. The images are divided into four subsets 
according to the angle between the light source direction and the camera axis: (a) subset 1 (up to 
°12 ); (b) subset 2 (up to °25 ); (c) subset 3 (up to °50 ) and (d) subset 4 (up to °77 ). 
 
 
   Following Ref. [7], in the experiments, the images in Subset 1 were selected as a training set, 
and then each of the remainder subsets was independently used as a test set. Since the recognition 
accuracy of the region based approach may be affected by the size of image region [25,26], several 
sizes of mirror-region were used in our experiments as shown below: 46112×  ( 1=K ) and 
23112×  ( 2=K ). It should be mentioned that, in the case of 3=K , the mirror-regions in the 
border of image (i.e., 1 LI  and 1 RI ) were set to a size of 16112×  and the remainder 
mirror-regions (i.e., 2 LI , 3 LI , 2 RI , and 3 RI ) were set to a size of 15112× . Moreover, following 
Ref. [7], the partition structure of the four regions (as shown in Fig. 5) was adopted when 
performing RHE in the experiments.

3.2 Weizmann 人臉資料庫的實驗結果 
   In the Weizmann database, we selected 150 face images of 10 adults with frontal pose and 
normal expression for our experiments. This subset contains 15 different illumination conditions for 
each adult. Following Ref. [27], in the experiments, the face images with frontal lighting condition 
were selected as a training set and the rest face images used as a test set. Fig. 10(a) and (b) show the 
set of face images of an adult used for training and testing, respectively. The experimental results 
are listed in Table 3. From the results, we can see that (1) MR-HEIA can achieve up to a 19.29% 
performance improvement over HE under using PCA-based recognition system and achieve up to a 
8.57% performance improvement over HE under using 2DPCA-based recognition system; (2) the 
performance difference between MR-HEIA and RHE is insignificant owing to the light source 
directions are gradually changing within a small range. The results are consistent with the 
experimental results on Yale B database (i.e., the results of Subset 2 and 3).

On the contrary, in our approach, the enhanced mirror region and corresponding mirror version are 
combined to form one new compensated image, in which the facial features are reinforced and other 
parts of the face are standardized. Accordingly, the MR-HEIA can overcome the disadvantage of 
RHE. 
 
    
Fig. 11. An example of performing the RHE: (a) original face images and (b) processed face 
images.    
 
 
   On the other hand, since the mirror-image method [9] only employs the mirror operation to 
produce the compensated face image (i.e., the brighter half face image is mirrored), it can only 
handle the illumination variation caused by left/right light source direction. On the contrary, the 
proposed approach based on HE and image average can further extend the ability of the 
mirror-image method [9] so as to handle the illumination variation caused by arbitrary light source 
directions. From another standpoint, the MR-HEIA can be viewed as an extension of the 
mirror-image method [9]. 
 
   Furthermore, based on the assumption of facial symmetry, it is not difficult to find that the last 
step of MR-HEIA can be omitted. This means that the modified average image (i.e., the 
compensated half face image) can be used directly for face recognition. Through carrying out the 
same experiments, we obtained the identical experimental results and confirmed the feasibility of 
this simplified approach. As far as computational speed and storage requirement are concerned, we 
have reasons to believe that the simplified version of MR-HEIA is an efficient illumination 
compensation approach and is more suitable for real-time face recognition system.

to a size of 112×92 pixels in the experiment.

respectively. Here, PCA and 2DPCA used all projection axes and the first 20 projection axes, 
respectively, for achieving the maximal recognition accuracy. From the results we can observe that

Generally speaking, in this project, we proposed a novel hybrid approach for face recognition 
and a shadow compensation approach for face recognition under varying illumination. These results 
have been published in the SCI-indexed journals – Pattern recognition [26] and Neurocomputing 
[28].

III. PROPOSED DISTURBANCE REDUCTION SCHEME 
A. Disturbance reduction scheme 
The structure of the proposed disturbance reduction 
scheme is shown in Fig. 2(a). In contrast with other 
disturbance rejection schemes [5], our proposed method can 
be easily applied to control systems subjected to periodic 
unknown load disturbances. With the presented scheme, 
furthermore, it can avoid the requirement for detecting 
unknown disturbance frequencies.  
In Fig. 2(a), the delay-free nominal model )(ˆ sG  is 
chosen to be stable with modeling uncertainties when the 
unknown delay-free real plant )(sG  is unstable. The 
compensative force )(ˆ1 sD  of the IDRC can be derived as 
follows:

modeling uncertainties, i.e., )()()( ssDsD L ρ+= . The 
relationship between )(sD  and )(ˆ1 sD  in (6) is similar to 
the transient response of a first-order system. When an 
appropriate nonnegative gain IK  is specified, the 
compensative force )(ˆ1 sD  can track the unknown input 
disturbance. In other words, both the unknown load 
disturbance and modeling uncertainties can be reduced by 
the compensative force )(ˆ1 sD . The residual signal )(sH  
introduced into the process can be defined by

structure of (a). 
 
Therefore, it is obvious that the implementation of the 
IDRC serves analogously as a high-pass filter introduced 
between the process and the unknown input disturbance. 
Since the nonnegative gain is related to the system stability, 
the compensative force )(ˆ1 sD  can reduce the unknown 
input disturbance whose frequency is less than the 
nonnegative gain. 
From (7), the proposed scheme shown in Fig. 2(a) can 
be simplified into the form shown in Fig. 2(b). Since the 
residual signal )(sH  can not be canceled out by the 
compensative force )(ˆ1 sD , a compensative force )(ˆ 2 sD  
generated from RDRC is proposed to reduce the residual 
signal )(sH  including residual disturbances and residual 
uncertainties. In Fig. 2(b), the transfer functions from the 
command )(sR  and the signal )(sH  to the system output 
)(sY  are respectively,

function )(sQ  is designed to be unity ( 1)( →sQ ) for all s . 
For the rejection of the measurement noise, however, the 
transfer function )(sQ  should be chosen as a low-pass 
filter. Hence, the transfer function )(sQ  based on the two 
requirements is designed as a low-pass filter having a unit 
gain. In addition, the relative degree of the low-pass filter 
)(sQ  should be chosen appropriately for the causality of 
the transfer function )(ˆ)( 1 sGsQ −  in Fig. 2(b).

where )(ND  and )(ˆ1 ND  respectively represent the 
unknown input disturbance and the compensative force of 
the IDRC of the Nth  iteration, and tΔ  is the sampling 
time in the simulation. Due to low-frequency disturbance 
and small sampling time, it can be assumed that )(ND  and 
)(ˆ1 ND  are approximated by )1( −ND  and )1(ˆ1 −ND , 
respectively. Therefore, (21) can be rewritten in the

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In the proceeding simulation, the sampling time is 1ms. 
The ANNs used in examples have the same structure which 
has one input layer with three neurons including the bias 
term, one hidden layer with three neurons and one output 
layer with one neuron.

Fig. 5(b) shows the system output controlled by the IDRC 
alone without the RDRC, with the periodic unknown load 
disturbances. It can be seen in Fig. 5(b) that the IDRC 
reduces effectively the unknown input including load 
disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The effect of the 
disturbance reduction obtained using the proposed scheme 
consisted of the IDRC and RDRC is shown in Fig. 5(c).
