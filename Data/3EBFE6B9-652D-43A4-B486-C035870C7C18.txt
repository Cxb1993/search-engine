How to define a decision measure 
and how to create a mechanism to 
determine the threshold value are the two 
major issues when it comes to the 
development of switching schemes for 
decision-based median filters [11]. Firstly, 
the decision measure deals with the 
extraction of the local information from 
the filter window and the establishment of 
the decision rule. The decision rule helps 
to distinguish noise-free pixels from 
noise-corrupted ones as precisely as 
possible. Secondly, a mechanism should 
be created to determine the threshold 
value. Generally speaking, a decision rule 
runs on the basis of a threshold value, and 
therefore the threshold value needs to be 
experimentally optimized. That is, a 
trade-off exists between noise reduction 
and the detail preservation. 
This project proposes a new 
progressive decision-based mean (PDM) 
filter based on the switching scheme 
concept to preserve details while 
effectively suppressing impulse noises. 
The Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence 
theory is introduced to help develop a 
decision rule that is not based on any 
threshold. In addition, a new approach to 
automatically determine mass functions 
for the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory 
is presented to obtain the combination 
belief value. To improve the accuracy rate 
of impulse noises detection, impulse 
detection is done progressively in iterative 
manners [9]. After the processing of 
impulse detector, pixels are successfully 
identified to be either noise-free or 
noise-corrupted. Therefore, only the 
noise-corrupted pixels in corrupted images 
are replaced with the mean value of those 
noise-free pixels in the filter window. 
Extensive simulation results demonstrate 
that the proposed algorithm is 
significantly better than other median- 
based filters. 
二、證據理論：  
To process uncertainty for 
information fusion, the numerical 
approaches currently available include 
probabilistic methods, the fuzzy set theory 
and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence 
theory. An event is called uncertain if its 
probability belongs to the [0, 1] interval. 
However, if the probability value falls in a 
certain interval, then it is said to be 
imprecise. The main limitation of 
probabilistic methods is that they cannot 
model the imprecision problem. The fuzzy 
approach can model imprecision about 
uncertainty measurement by using Type-2 
fuzzy sets [12-13]. However, to our 
knowledge, the operators are restrictive 
since the membership functions are 
always selected in a supervised way. The 
D-S evidence theory provides a more 
flexible and general approach since it 
allows the representation of both 
uncertainty and imprecision. Another 
major advantage of the D-S evidence 
theory is its ability to consider not only 
individual classes, but also unions of 
possible classes. Therefore, the D-S 
evidence theory approach is used herein to 
build the noise detector of the PDM filter.    
2.1. Bodies of evidence 
The Dempster-Shafer theory was 
developed by Arthur Dempster in the 
1960’s, and later extended by Glen Shafer 
[14-15]. Suppose Θ  is a finite set of 
mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
hypotheses, called a frame of discernment. 
The D-S evidence theory can adaptively 
consider any subset of Θ . The expression 
Θ2  denotes the power set of Θ . Then a 
mass function m  can be expressed in 
terms of a function 
]1,0[2: →Θm ,             (1) 
such that

expert believes that such a claim is

decision rule to decide which hypothesis 
in Θ  is the best solution. However, the 
strategy of decision rule development 
tends to differ from application to 
application nowadays [16-17]. 
 
三、設計技術與方法： 
A decision-based filter consists of 
two parts: impulse detection and noise 
filtering. The impulse detection deal with 
two issues: the definition of a decision 
measure and the search for an optimal 
threshold value [11]. Noise filtering is for 
the removal of noisy pixels. The impulse 
detector of the proposed PDM filter 
employs the D-S evidence theory and 
offers an answer to the two issues with a 
simple and robust decision-making 
scheme. To achieve robust noise detection, 
the detection and filtering process can be 
iteratively applied to the corrupted image 
pixels. In order to develop the D-S 
impulse detector, the set of all possible 
outcomes must be defined, and a method 
to acquire the bodies of evidence must be 
built. In applying D-S evidence theory to 
the noise detector, the frame of 
discernment includes two elements: 
noise-free ( F ) and noise-corrupted ( N ). 
The hypotheses to be considered in the 
D-S formulation are ,φ  singleton 
hypothesis ,N  singleton hypothesis 
,F and compound hypothesis NF  (for 
convenience of notation, }{ FN ∪  is 
written as NF ).  
3.1. Impulse detector 
Let X  denote a two-dimensional 
lh×  corrupted image. A filter window 
)(kw (or a sliding window) whose size is 
12)12( 2 +=+= nS τ  (where S  is odd, 
in general) covers the image X  at 
location ),( ji .  
)),(,),(),(),(,),(()( 101 kxkxkxkxkxkw nn LL −−=
            (7) 
where )(0 kx (or )(kx ) is the original 
central vector-valued pixel at location k , 
jlik +×−= )1( .  
3.1.1. Evidence extraction and mass 
function definition 
In many application systems with the 
D-S evidence theory, the mass functions 
are assigned by domain experts [18]. In 
this work, there are four bodies of 
evidence obtained by extracting the 
features from the local filter window. 
Moreover, the values of mass functions 
are automatically assigned based on a 
reasoning approach. The following four 
feature variables )(),(),( kvkbks  and 
)(ke  can be defined to obtain the four 
independent bodies of evidence, 
respectively. 
Definition 1: )()()( kwMEDkxks −= ,             
(8) 
where MED stands for the median 
operation.  
Definition 2: The evidence )(kb j  of the

             (9) 
where )(kx  is the mean gray level in the 
filter window )(kw  sized 12 +n  [19]. 
The bodies of evidence )(ks  and )(kb  
(or )(0 kb ) provide efficient measures to 
identify noisy pixels. A large )(ks  or 
)(kb  values strongly indicates that the 
input pixel )(kx  is corrupted by impulse 
noise. 
However, if only evidence )(ks or 
)(kb  is applied, the line and edge 
components in the filter window )(kw  
will be identified as noise [10]. That is, 
impulse noise is incorrectly determined to 
be located at pixel )(kx . To avoid the 
incorrect determination, the bodies of

)].()()()([ 2121 NmFmFmNmK +=       (20) 
From Eqs. (3) and (4), the final belief and 
plausibility values of hypotheses FN ,  
and NF  can be obtained. 
3.1.3. Progressive decision making  
In this work, the decision rule based 
on singleton hypotheses is determined by 
the final combined belief values. Then, the 
D-S impulse detector of the PDM filter 
determines whether the input )(kx  is a 
noise-corrupted or noise-free pixel, 
according to the following belief decision 
rule [22].

3.2. Noise filtering 
Figure 4 shows the noise filtering 
process of the PDM filter. If the input 
pixel is classified as an impulse according 
to the binary noise flag map ),( jiM , then 
it is replaced with the central noise-free 
ordered mean value. Otherwise, the input 
pixel stays unchanged. However, the 
central noise-free ordered mean value here 
is determined with only the noise-free 
pixels within the filter window 
)(kw [9-10]. The noise-free pixels can be 
arranged in ascending order, which 
defines the vector as

poorly removed. On the other hand, the 
ATM filter provides better performance 
than the former two methods; however, a 
blurring effect is still observed and 
impulse noise is not sufficiently 
suppressed. Apparently, the PDM filter 
has the best subjective visual quality of 
the restored image, which means best 
noise suppression and detail preservation.  
In addition, to evaluate the efficiency 
of the proposed techniques at various 
noise ratios, Fig. 8 presents the 
comparative PSNR results of filtering the 
‘Boat’ image corrupted at impulse noise 
ratios from 10% to 30%. Clearly, Fig. 8 
reveals that the new PDM filter performs 
significantly better than the other filters.  
  
五、討論與結論： 
In this project, a new progressive 
decision-based mean filter for impulse 
noise removal is proposed. The proposed 
PDM filter is composed of a new D-S 
impulse detector and a noise filtering 
process. In order to add the D-S evidence 
theory to the PDM filter, a new method 
is presented to automatically determine 
the mass functions. The proposed 
impulse detector is progressively applied 
through several iterations based on the 
decision rule, so that it can successfully 
identify the impulse noise, minimizing 
the mean square error of the filter output. 
The filtering operations are selectively 
applied to the pixels that are classified as 
noise-corrupted. The extensive 
simulation results have shown that the 
proposed PDM filter significantly 
outperforms a number of well-accepted 
decision-based filters. The PDM filter 
exhibits excellent robustness, capable of 
giving not only better PSNR values but 
also satisfactory perceptual quality.

To overcome the problem of counter-intuitive, Chen et al.

modified approach is to assign the conflict weight in the null 
set to the elements which happen to be intersections of the 
combining masses and the base set .Θ  Assuming

III. DESIGN OF  TSRAM FILTER   
A. Structure of TSRAM filter 
   The framework of the proposed TSRAM filter is illustrated 
in Fig. 1. It is composed of a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) impulse 
detector and two switching scheme-based image filters. The 
input pixels are first identified by the D-S impulse detector to 
either noisy or undisturbed good. Then, according to the 
results of the D-S impulse detector, the first pass filtering 
applies rank-ordered arithmetic mean (RAM) filter to remove 
impulsive noise or ‘no filtering’ to preserve true pixels. 
Notably, the RAM filter applies to the pixels in the filtering 
window which were detected to be not affected by the noise 
process. The first RAM filter can remove most noises, but the 
lesser impulse might remain. In order to alleviate this 
problem, a simple switching recursive rank-ordered 
arithmetic mean (RRAM) filter is performed to remove the 
residue nosy pixels.

B. D-S impulse detector  
A switching noise-detection scheme based on DSET is 
developed to classify each pixel to be noisy pixel or 
undisturbed good one. To apply the DSET to the impulse 
detector in Fig. 1, the frame of discernment includes two 
elements: corrupted pixel ( C ) and undisturbed good pixel 
( G ). Thus, the power set contains four elements: 
UGC ,, (universe GC ∪ ), and empty set (φ ) [2]. In this 
work, the D-S impulse detector makes its decision on the 
basis of three bodies of evidences ),(ks )(kz and 
)(ke (introduced in the next subsection), and modified 
Dempster’s combination rule in (8).  
B.1 Evidence extraction and mass function definition 
Let }1,1|),{( 2121 WkHkkkK ≤≤≤≤=  denote the pixel 
coordinates of the noisy image corrupted by impulsive noise, 
where H  and W  are the image height and width, 
respectively. Let )(kx  represent the input pixel value of the 
noisy image at location .Kk ∈  At each location ,k  the 
observed filter window }{kw  whose size is 12 += nN ( n  is 
a non-negative integer) is defined in terms of the coordinates 
symmetrically surrounding the input pixel )(kx .

rule in (8) is applied to our work. The orthogonal sum is 
expressed as .)()()( kekzks mmm ⊕⊕  The combination mass

B.3. Detection rule of the D-S impulse detector 
The main issue of the switching scheme-based filters lies in 
building a decision rule that can identify the undisturbed good 
pixels from noisy ones as precisely as possible. When the 
belief value )(Cm  exceeds the belief value ),(Gm the input 
pixel )(kx  can be seen as a noisy pixel. That is, the D-S 
impulse detector of the TSRAM filter determines whether the 
input )(kx  is a noisy or undisturbed good pixel, according to 
the following belief decision rule.

C. Two-pass switching-scheme noise filtering 
If the input pixel is classified as an impulse according to 
the ),( jiF , then the noisy pixel is replaced by the output of 
the RAM filter. Otherwise, the input pixel is unchanged 
(identity operation). The mean value in the RAM filter here is 
a rank-ordered mean evaluated as

The first RAM filter can remove most noises, but it might 
misclassify pixel at high noise density interference. That is, 
the lesser impulse might remain. In order to alleviate this 
problem and improve the filtering performance, a simple 
switching recursive rank-ordered arithmetic mean (RRAM) 
filter is also performed to remove the residue nosy pixels. 
Notably, the outputs of the recursive RAM filter mean that 
the estimate of current pixel depends on past filter outputs. 
The second pass filter for detecting the noisy pixels is based 
on the difference between the output )(' ky  of the first pass 
filter and the median value of the current filter window }{' kw . 
Then, the second pass filter employs the threshold T  to 
determine the final output )(ky [2].

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
There are two types of impulsive noises: fixed-valued and 
random-valued impulse. In a gray-scale image, the 
fixed-valued impulse, which is also known as salt and pepper 
noise, shows up as equal to or near maximum or minimum of 
the allowable dynamic range with equal probability 
(i.e. p5.0 ), while the random-valued impulse is uniformly 
distributed over the range of [0, 255] at ratio p . 
Extensive experiments have been conducted on a variety of 
512512×  test images to evaluate the effectiveness of our new 
TSRAM filter. The 33×  filter windows were used in all the 
experiments. The mean squared error (MSE) has been 
employed to measure the restoration performance 
quantitatively.  
The influence of the threshold value T  on the second pass 
filtering was first evaluated. The MSE values obtained by 
adjusting the threshold value T  for different test images are 
graphically presented in Fig. 2. The proper threshold values 
are obtained experimentally for different test images. For the 
majority of images we tested, the threshold value T  
employed by the TSRAM filter lies approximately in the 
range of [20, 30]. We observe that the threshold range is quite 
consistent and common for the fixed-valued and 
random-valued impulsive noises; as a result, the performance 
is rather stable. 
The second experiment compared the TSRAM filter with 
many switching-based median filters in terms of noise 
removal capability, including the median (MED) filter, 
switching scheme I (SWM-I) filter [5], the signal-dependent 
rank order mean (SD-ROM) filter [6], adaptive sigma vector 
median filter (ASVMF) [3] and fast peer group filter (FPGF) 
[4] were compared in our experiments. In addition, the 
state-of the-art adaptive center weighted median (ACWM) 
filter [1] and thresholding noise-free ordered mean (TNOM) 
filter [2] were also compared with the TSRAM filter. Table II 
compares the MSE results of removing impulses for both the 
fixed-valued and random-valued impulsive noises at %20 .
