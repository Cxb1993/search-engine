INTRODUCTION
Sludge discharged from the electroplating and steel acid pickling processes (1-5)
frequently contain environmental pollution by toxic metals such as Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu (6).
The toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) method is generally used in
regulation of threshold concentrations of leachable toxic metals from environmental
solids (7, 8). However, the TCLP data can only provide the level of pollutant
concentrations with little chemically structural information. Nevertheless, it is not
clear what specific reactions take place during the TCLP of the operationally defined
phase. The main scientific issues concerning the chemical forms (or speciation) of
contaminants ultimately depend on molecular-scale structure. Basic understanding
at this scale is essential in the management of environmental contaminants.
The knowledge of the chemical composition of the sludge is valuable for industrial
hygienists in the evaluation of toxicity and disposal of heavy metal sludge.
Molecular level information of complex environmental solids can only be obtained
from powerful molecular-scale probes that utilize the electromagnetic radiation such
as X-ray or infrared radiation. Due to the low concentration of the toxic elements in
the sludges, the radiation must be of sufficient intensity to allow detection of these
elements or species and get permissive characterization of their molecular structure,
composition, spatial distribution, and phase association. Although, methods (such as
XRD (X-ray powder diffraction) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy)) have
been applied widely, the molecular structure of the chemical speciation is less well
established (10,11) for the environmental solid. A new insight concerning the
speciation of select element in the complex environmental solid can be obtained by
XANES spectroscopy (12, 13).
XANES is a single-ion probe that can interrogate one element in a complicated
sample. XANES spectroscopy can be used in characterization of oxidation state of an
Si(111) double-crystal monochromator was used for selection of energy with an
energy resolution (E/E) of 1.9×10-4 (eV/eV). The absorption spectra were collected
in ion chambers that were filled with helium gas. Beam energy was calibrated by the
adsorption edge of Cu foil at an energy of 8979 eV. An equivalent step of 0.25
eV/point was used in XANES scanning while the 1.0 eV/point was conducted for
EXAFS accumulation of data. A nickel metal standard foil located in front of a
reference ion chamber was measured simultaneously with each spectral sample for
in-situ energy calibration. The isolated EXAFS data were normalized to the edge
jump and converted to the wavenumber scale. Coordination numbers were
systematically varied in the course of the analysis within a given fitting range.
Fitting of the data to model compounds was performed using FEFFIT from UWXAFS
3.0 in combination with FEFF 8.0. The absorption edge was determined at the
half-height (precisely determined by the derivative) of the XANES spectra of sludge
samples after pre-edge baseline subtraction and normalization to the maximum
post-edge intensity. Principal component (factor) analysis (PCA) was used in the
data treatment to optimize the quantitative extraction of relative concentrations of
copper species (18, 19).
Semi-quantitative analyses of the edge spectra were conducted by the least-square
fitting of linear combinations of standard spectra to the spectrum of the sample. The
height and area of the near-edge band in a copper spectrum were quantitatively
proportional to the amount of copper species. XANES spectra of standard copper
compounds such as CuCl2, Cu2O, Cu(OH)2, CuO, CuS, CuCO3, CuCl2, CuSO4, CuCl,
Cu2S, Cu foil, Cu-EDTA, and Cu-HS were also measured on the Wiggler beamline.
To convert XANES fit percentages into the more commonly used weight percentages,
a series of synthetic binary mixtures of CuCO3 and Cu(OH)2 was measured and a plot
of weight percent of CuCO3 versus the obtained XANES fit percentage was generated.
eV) that is forbidden by the selection rule in the perfect octahedral symmetry (20, 21).
A shoulder at 8987.0 eV and an intense band at 8996.5 eV may be attributed to the
1s-to-4p transition that indicates the existence of Cu(II). The pre-edge band at
8981-8984 eV may be due to the dipole-allowed 1s-to-4p transition of Cu(I) was not
found in the sludges. A weak band at 9002.5 eV was also observed, suggesting that
a very small amount of Cu(0) might exist in the EP sludge.
In order to make the XANES features more distinct, the first derivatives of the
XANES spectra are also shown in the upper corner of Figure 1. Metallic Cu (Cu(0))
(9001 eV) and Cu(I) (8982.4 eV) were able to be distinguished. Cu(II) (8985.8 eV)
and (8991.0 eV) was able to be distinguished in the EP sludge. Cu(0) (9001 eV) was
found in the EP sludge.
The XANES spectra were also expressed mathematically in a LC XANES fit
vectors, using the absorption data within the energy range of 8960-9020 eV.
XANES spectra of standard samples such as Cu(OH)2, CuS, CuSO4, CuCO3, CuCl2,
and Cu-EDTA were measured on the Wiggler beamline. Cu(OH)2 was the main
copper species in the AP sludge. In addition to Cu(OH)2, CuCl2, and Cu-EDTA were
also found in the EP sludge (see Figure 1). Relative contents of the copper species in
the electroplating and acid pickling sludges with an over 95% reliability in the fitting
process.
Cu(OH)2 in the EP and AP sludges was formed in the waste water treatments.
The EDTA that used in the electroplating process was also found as Cu-EDTA in the
EP sludge. A very small amount CuSO4 also existed in EP sludge. Copper
speciation such as Cu(OH)2, CuS or CuCO3 possess a low copper leachability in the
TCLP experiments. The AP sludge contained a high content of Cu(OH)2, CuS, and
CuCO3, as expected, have a relative low leachability of copper.
