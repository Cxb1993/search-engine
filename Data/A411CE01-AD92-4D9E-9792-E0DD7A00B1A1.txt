power allocation algorithms. The feature of IWF algorithm is that it can achieve Nash 
equilibrium if it converges. At Nash equilibrium, each user acts as the best response in 
terms of maximum capacity of himself given all the others’ action is known [9]. 
However, since each user is selfish, that is maximizing its own capacity regardless all 
the others, it would cause interference, which limits the capacity improvement of IWF. 
To achieve higher capacity, an orthogonal power allocation method, which removes 
interference, is proposed. We provide a mathematic model first to compare the 
capacity of orthogonal with non-orthogonal or overlapping power allocation, where 
the non-orthogonal power allocation is based on the consequence of IWF. After that, 
we propose a subchannel splitting algorithm, such that the subchannel is exclusive 
owned by each user and no interference anymore. The results show that both 
individual and aggregate capacity outperforms the result of IWF. In addition to the 
splitting algorithm, we also propose an overlapping criterion. The overlapping 
criterion identifies the condition that the spectrum is suitable to be overlapping used 
in terms of higher capacity. 
Moreover, in this joint work, another research focuses on uplink energy-efficient 
resource allocation is studied in an OFDMA cooperative relay network. Uplink 
energy-efficient communication is an important issue due to the limited battery power 
for Mobile Stations (MSs). The average ‘Bits-per-Joule’ is defined as the energy 
efficiency metric, and the optimal joint power allocation for both MS and RS is 
derived for maximizing MS’ energy efficiency. Based on that, we developed a 
low-complexity subcarrier-power allocation and relay selection scheme for 
maximizing energy efficiency per user in an OFDMA cooperative relay network, 
assuming full channel state information (CSI) is available at both relay and BS nodes. 
The numerical result demonstrates that the energy efficiency performance of 
cooperative relay networks can be better in the range of 15% to 30% as compared to 
that of single BS networks. It also shows our proposed scheme has significant 
improvement on the energy efficiency performance as compared with conventional 
max-throughput and fairness-based Equal-Power Allocation (EPA) schemes which 
allocate equal transmit power to the assigned subcarriers. Furthermore, the proposed 
scheme can achieve similar performance in much lower computational complexity as 
compared with the exhaustive search scheme. 
 
Research Approach and Results 
 Spectrum Sensing in MAC Layer: Sensing Period Decision [24] 
To obtain the optimal sensing period is indeed an important topic under cognitive 
radio networks. This subject provides an accurate and simple model to describe the 
relationship of expected collision time and sensing period. This model is based on the 
IWF. In this simulation, the power budget of both users is 10 mW. Noise power of 
each subchannel is set to be -100dBm. The results have been average over 100 trials. 
The vertical axis of Fig.3 is in unit of bit per second per Hz. The degradation of the 
curve as Nc increase is because the power is spread over wider spectrum and the 
unused port increase as Nc. As Fig. 3 shown, by applying subchannel splitting, both 
users can gain the capacity improvement simultaneously, given the same power 
budget. 
 
Fig. 3 
Remember that notation a and b are small when cross gain is small relative to direct 
gain. Also, P1 and P2 are the receive power at receiver 1 and 2, respectively. Actually, 
the above inequality specifies the SSS region. Given P1 and P2, for the case that a and 
b lie in the SSS region, overlapping usage brings more capacity than TDM/FDM does. 
More specifically, fig. 4 (a) shows the function plot of 1( , ) a bf a b

Conclusion 
In this project, we have achieved 2 conference paper submission [24][25] in the areas 
of the cognitive and wireless cooperative network. The topic of our contributions 
includes spectrum sensing in MAC Layer, in which the relationship of expected 
collision time and sensing period are derived and modeled in cognitive radio networks, 
spectrum sharing and power allocation in the interference channel, in which a 
subchannel splitting algorithm to further improve the capacity is proposed, and the 
improvement of 30~40% capacity gain is achieved, and resource allocation for 
cooperative relay networks, in which the optimal joint power allocation for both MS 
and RS is derived for maximizing MS’ energy efficiency, and a low-complexity 
subcarrier-power allocation and relay selection scheme for maximizing bits-per-joule 
in an OFDMA cooperative relay network is proposed. The numerical experiments 
show the improvement on bits-per-joule achieved by the proposed scheme is about 
15~60% compared to other existing schemes.
