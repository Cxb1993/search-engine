2. English abstract 
    Polymer light emitting diodes (PLED) is a popular topic for conducting polymer, cause that 
PLED possess many advantages, such as low cost, easy process and easy production of large area, 
and that inorganic light emitting diodes lack. These benefits are noticeable in the field of 
academic and industry. In view of many advantages of PLED, such as self radiate, wide visibility 
angle, high respondent rate, low drive voltage, full color and the production of flexible device, 
these benefits offer a great potential for the application of new generation of flat panel display 
systems. Recently, electroluminescence (EL) in conjugated polymer have been the subject that 
many research and company interest, but the question of EL efficiency and device lifetime in 
PLED is considered as an important fact for development the PLED product. However, the EL 
efficiency is dependent on balance the number of holes and electrons injected to the emitter layer. 
There is a barrier height between ITO film and polymer emission layer in PLED structure, so in 
our research particles formed nanometer core-shell metal composites were used as a hole 
transport layer between them in order to reduce barrier height and increase electron-hole 
recombination EL efficiency. However, the device lifetime is dependent on the rapid rate of 
photo-oxidation of the semiconducting polymer under ambient conditions. This drawback is due 
to the singlet oxygen formed, therefore at this plans, Use core/shell nano-particles to quench the 
triplet exciton lifetime, reducing the rate of photo-oxidation (singlet oxygen). Due to the

3.2 Fabrication of the PLED 
The plastic substrate and conductive plastic substrate used in this study is a transparent 
polymer named ARTON (ARTON F, JSR Co., Ltd., Japan). The ITO film is streaked with the 
photolithography processing via etching and is as anode electrode. The sheet resistance of ITO 
was obtained at 50 Ω/□. The sheet resistance of conductive plastic substrate is obtained at 200 
Ω/□. A buffer layer of 50 nm poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene; PEDOT) was over coated onto 
the ITO electrode as the hole injection layer. The luminescence polymer is an green 
fluorine-containing co-polymer (5BTF8) consisting of 5 wt% poly 
(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) and 95 wt% poly (9,9-dioctylfluorene). 5BTF8 was 
spin coated from xylene solution. The cathode with 100 nm of calcium (Ca) and 100 nm of 
aluminum (Al) deposited by thermal evaporation under 1×10-6 Torr vacuum. The passivation 
layer of core@shell particles is deposited by spin coating. The SiO2 layer packaging is deposited 
by thermal evaporation. 
3.3 Characteristics of the Device 
The electrical and luminescence characteristics of the device were measured by using a 
current/voltage source measurement unit (Keithley 2400) and the brightness was measured using 
a Photo Research (PR650) spectrophotometer.  
 
4. Results and Discussion 
4.1 Studies on Fabrication of PLED on the Plastic Substrate 
In this study, in order to obtain the optimum conditions of PLED fabrication on the plastic 
substrate without nanoparticles addition, we first fabricate several PLED structures on the stable 
glass substrate, whose structures are shown in the inset of Fig. 1~3. And then the optimum 
parameters of PLED structure on glass substrate will obtained to fabricate flexible PLED on the 
plastic substrate. The current density-voltage (J-V) and luminance-voltage (L-V) of simple PLED 
structure with only emission layer (5BTF8) are shown in Fig. 1(a)−(b). The process spin coating 
of 400, 800, 1200, 1600 and 2000 rpm 5BTF8 are performed under aluminum (Al) at 100 nm. 
When spin coating of 5BTF8 at 1600 rpm, the smaller turn-on voltage and maximum 
luminescence were observed at ~12 V and ~34 cd/m2. 
Figure 2 shows the characteristics J-V and L-V of PLED with addition hole injection layer 
(PEDOT) as function speed coating of PEDOT under the emission layer (5BTF8) at 1600 rpm of 
speed coating. However, the optimum turn-on voltage of PLED was observed in PEDOT spin 
coating at 2000 rpm, which has smaller turn-on voltage at about 4 V. We also find that the 
maximum luminescence is obtained at about 600 cd/m2. The difference of the turn-on voltage is 
about 4 V for with and without insertion of PEDOT layer, which greatly improves the EL 
performance compared with the devices without PEDOT layer as Fig. 1. This is due to the fact 
that the energy level barrier becomes smooth when the charge carrier moves from ITO to organic 
material by addition hole injection layer (PEDOT). 
Figure 3 shows the characteristics J-V and L-V of PLED with addition calcium (Ca) cathode 
as function thicknesses of Ca. The device with a 100 nm thick Ca cathode exhibited the 
maximum brightness; however, the current density was relatively high for that device. Therefore,

4.4 Studies on Fabrication of PLED on the Conductive Plastic Substrate 
In this year (2005), we focus on studies polymer light-emitting devices (PLED) fabrication 
in conductive plastic substrate. In this work, in order to obtain the optimum conditions of PLED 
fabrication on the conductive plastic substrate without nanoparticles addition, we first fabricate 
several PLED structures on the conductive plastic substrate, whose structures are shown in the 
inset of Fig. 8−9. And then the optimum parameters of PLED structure will obtain to fabricate 
flexible PLED on the conductive plastic substrate. The current density-voltage (J-V) and 
luminance-voltage (L-V) of sample PLED structure with only emission layer (5BTF8) are shown 
in Fig. 8(a)−(b). The spin coating of 800, 1200, 1600 and 2000 rpm 5BTF8 are performed under 
aluminum (Al) at 100 nm. When spin coating of 5BTF8 at 1600 rpm, the smaller turn-on voltage 
and maximum luminescence were observed at ~20 V and ~30 cd/m2, respectively. 
 Figure 9 shows the characteristics J-V and L-V of PLED with addition hole injection layer 
(PEDOT) as function speed coating of PEDOT under the emission layer (5BTF8) at speed 
coating of 1600 rpm. However, the optimum turn-on voltage of PLED was observed in PEDOT 
spin coating at 2000 rpm, which has smaller turn-on voltage at about 13 V. We also find that the 
maximum luminescence is obtained at about 550 cd/m2. The difference of the turn-on voltage is 
about 4 V for with and without insertion of PEDOT layer, which greatly improves the EL 
performance compared with the devices without PEDOT layer as Fig. 8. This is due to the fact 
that the energy level barrier becomes smooth when the charge carrier moves from substrate to 
organic material by addition hole injection layer (PEDOT).  
Figure 10 shows the characteristics J-V and L-V of PLED with addition calcium (Ca) 
cathode as function thicknesses of Ca. The device with a 100 nm thick Ca cathode exhibited the 
maximum brightness; however, the current density was relatively high for that device. Therefore, 
the optimum parameters of PLED structure on conductive plastic substrate were obtained as 
PEDOT was 2000 rpm, F8BT was 1600 rpm, Al was 100 nm, and Ca was 100 nm. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this plan, we report the first deliberate ues core@shell particle passivation layer for the 
device packaging in last year (2004). The inclusion of the passivation layer leads to a significant 
improvement in the life-time of the device. In this year (2005), we carry on studies the conductive 
plastic substrate was used as an anode electrode to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) film for 
fabrication of the PLED. However, we have many experiences and fruitful results in fabrication 
of nanoparticle and PLED. Final, we want to say thank to National Science Council (NSC). It 
was thanks to the NSC help that this plan was achieved successfully on time.
