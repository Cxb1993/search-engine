response of liquid crystal cell to leaky guided waves. 
Experiments and Results 
The liquid crystal specimen adopted in experiment 
was made of a parallel-glass plate cell with 65 µm thick 
spacers. Each glass plate is 600 µm thick and coated with 
a vertical aligned layer on its inner surface. Cells were 
assembled using epoxy-based UV adhesive. The 
intermediate layer is filled with pentylcyanobiphenyl 
(5CB) NLC in homeotropic alignment. The whole 
specimen is 280×320 mm with edges protected by 
silicone rubber to get rid of a leak. The silicone resin is 
further used as absorbers to prevent ultrasound reflected 
from edges. The specimen was placed between two 
crossed polarizers to examine its alignment before 
experiment.  
In experiment, the specimen was attached to a holder 
within a water tank with a constant temperature near 
30oC. The specimen was insonified at various angles of 
incidence by flat immersion ultrasonic transducers with a 
distance beyond the near-field limit of acoustic beam. 
The experiments are carried out in the frequency range 
from 0.2 to 7 MHz by three flat, broadband transducers 
(Panametrics, Inc.) with center frequencies of 1, 2.25, 
and 5 MHz. A CW signal of swept frequency was 
generated by an Agilent 33250A function generator 
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara) to establish a steady 
state excitation. The signals are magnified by an ENI 
325LA power amplifier with 50 dB gain. A 633 nm 
He:Ne laser beam was aimed at the point slightly away 
from the acoustic spot. The variation in optical intensity 
was detected by a New Focus model 1801 photo-receiver. 
All data capture and parameter setting were computer-
controlled by LabVIEW (National Instruments, Inc.) 
When the pressure acoustic wave impinges onto the 
liquid crystal cell, multiple reflection or refraction occurs 
at each interface of glass and surrounding water as well 
as glass-liquid crystal. The mode-converted bulk acoustic 
waves induced at each reflection or refraction construct 
dispersive guided waves propagating along the cell. The 
guided waves are sensitive to variations in material 
properties and thickness of the waveguide. The liquid 
crystal inside the cell is not directly affected by 
ultrasound insonification. Instead, the liquid crystal is 
disturbed by guided waves induced in the specimen at a 
number of modal frequencies. The multi-modal guided 
waves propagate parallel to the specimen with the phase 
velocity c in a relation to the angle of incidence θ  
through Snell’s law,  
θ= sinocc ,          (3) 
where co is the acoustic wave speed in the surrounding 
water. 
The amplitude spectra of the optical transmission can 
be recorded as functions of exciting frequency and the 
angle of incidence in the range of 10o to 45o at 1o interval. 
The acousto-optic response was captured by 80 
individual data points at 0.25 sec constant interval for 
every condition. For each data set the final 8 data points 
were averaged to give a steady state optical intensity of 
transmission.  
Fig. 2 shows the intensity of optical transmission 
versus the swept frequency of ultrasound measured at 
various angles of incidence. The optical intensity is 
enveloped by the spectra of ultrasonic transducers. The 
acoustic intensity is held constant for a period of 20 sec 
at a peak-to-peak output voltage of 80 mV from function 
generator. The data shown in the graph were obtained 
from average of the final 8 data points at each optical 
intensity measurement. The optical transmission occurs at 
specific frequencies depending on the angle of incidence. 
It is shown in Fig. 3 that the peak optical intensity 
transmitted through the cell occurs at the minimum of 
LLW reflected amplitude spectrum. It corresponds to the 
modal frequency of guided wave generated in the cell. 
Fig. 4 depicts the acousto-optic response of liquid 
crystal cell insonified by acoustic beam with driving 
frequency of 1.18, 1.20,and 1.22 MHz at 20o angle of 
incidence. The optical intensity increases to the steady 
state value within 1.8 seconds. The response time is 
independent of the acoustic intensity, but it is correlative 
to the frequency of ultrasound. 
Simulation and Discussion 
Consider a liquid crystal cell immersed in water and 
insonified by a plane harmonic acoustic wave. Assume 
that the cell is infinitely long in the x3-direction. All the 
field variables are further assumed to be independent of 
the coordinate x3. The plane acoustic waves in the ideal 
fluid can be represented in terms of two Helmholtz 
potentials, 0Φ  for the upper fluid and bΦ  for the lower 
fluid. The displacement and stress components in the 
acoustic field are given by 
ii xu ∂Φ∂= α , 2,1=i         (4) 
αα Φωρ−=σ 222 , 012 =σ ,        (5) 
where the index α denotes either 0 or b. For an ideal fluid, 
the shear stress components vanish and the normal 
component of the displacement is continuous at the fluid-
solid interfaces; however, tangential slip between the 
fluid and the solid is allowed. The boundary conditions at 
the top and bottom surfaces of the liquid crystal cell can 
be expressed in the form

ultrasound into the sandwich liquid crystal cell. 
Experimental evidence indicates that the acousto-optic 
response of vertically aligned NLCs is correlative to 
modal excitations of guided waves.  
The experimental results show that S0, S1 modes of 
guided waves have strong effect on the realignment of 
liquid crystal molecules. The A0 mode has only sight 
influence. The measured optical intensity depends on the 
gap of liquid crystal cell, acoustic intensity, angle of 
incidence, and so on. Further, liquid crystals possess 
faster response in high frequency range. Even though the 
response time does not reach the required commercial 
standard, it is worth further study on acoustic realignment 
of liquid crystals using guided waves. 
The NLC layer sandwiched between two glass plates 
is modeled as a hypothetical isotropic solid with a single 
viscosity. Phase velocity curves and displacement, stress, 
and strain distributions in the cells are simulated. 
Numerical results show that A0, S0, and S1 modes have 
significant pressure gradients in the liquid layer. This 
prediction agrees with experimental results. The fluid 
mode and the A0 mode at high frequencies possess the 
characteristics of interface waves. Most deformation of 
the solid layer is confined in a region near the interface. 
Pressure gradient and wave energy are localized in the 
liquid layer. Interface acoustic waves will have a great 
application potential in manipulation of NLC molecules.

zero denominator, D(kI, ω) = 0, yields the dispersion equation 
for thermoacoustic waves propagating in the thin plate. 
A. Constitutive Relations 
Consider a material body has undergone a deformation 
from natural state through initial state to final state as shown in 
Fig. 2. The natural state indicates the original state free of 
stress and strain. The initial state is a pre-deformed state in 
which residual stresses remain. When a thermal induced 
acoustic wave is superposed on the body in the initial state, the 
body is further deformed to the final state. Assume that there is 
no temperature change between the natural state and the initial 
state. The stress components TIJ and the increment of entropy Ξ
satisfy the following constitutive equations: 
∆Θλ−= IJLKIJKLIJ ucT , ,    ∆Θα+λ=Ξ LKKLu , ,      (4) 
where the subscripts I, J, K, L = 1, 2, 3; uK,L and ∆Θ indicates the 
strain changes and temperature rise caused by the external 
disturbance applied to the initial state. IJKLc , IJλ  and α  denote 
the elastic constants, thermal modulus and thermal constant 
influenced by initial strains, respectively. They are of the form

constants, thermal modulus and thermal constant measured in 
the natural state, respectively. Both cIJKL and cIJKLMN possess 
symmetry property. The effective elastic constants involving 
residual stress effect are usually expressed in Voigt’s notation. 
The correspondence between the initial strains i LKu ,  and the 
initial (residual) stresses iIJT  is in the form of i LKIJKLiIJ ucT ,= .
B. Governing Equations

propagation in a medium under residual stress must satisfy the 
equations of motion in the initial state of the form
