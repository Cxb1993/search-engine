In a circuit system, IR drop effect can be 
alleviated by reducing the peak current of the 
system. Clock skew scheduling is a popular 
technique for peak current reduction. In this report, 
we propose two algorithms that apply a Multiple 
Threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) technique rather 
than clock skew scheduling to do peak current 
reduction. MTCMOS techniques are feasible to 
reduce peak current because different threshold 
cells have different cell delays and current 
waveforms. Experimental results show that our 
technique can reduce the peak current up to 47.7%. 
Our proposed technique has an advantage over 
others because the technique can reduce not only 
peak current but also leakage current. Another 
advantage of our proposed technique is that no 
area overhead is required.

二、 前言  
In the nanometer era, an SOC (System on 
Chip) chip comes up against some new problems 
that include high design complexity, large peak 
current (power), etc. These problems increase the 
difficulty of developing an SOC chip. Therefore, 
developing new EDA (Electronic Design 
Automation) tools/techniques for solving these 
problems is urgent for SOC designers.  
In an SOC chip, a clock signal that arrives at 
many flip-flops of the chip nearly simultaneously 
causes these flip-flops to be triggered and to 
produce peak transient charging and discharging 
currents. If these currents are too large, the power 
(VDD) line and the ground (VSS) line will produce 
serious voltage drop (IR drop) and ground bounce. 
The voltage drop and the ground bounce affect the 
speed of circuit switching. They even cause logic 
errors of a chip [1][2]. So, voltage drop and 
ground bounce alleviations are the important tasks 
for an SOC designer. Many researches show that 
reducing the peak current of a design is a good 
approach for inhibiting the effect of the voltage 
drop and the ground bounce. 
In a synchronous logic design, assigning 
different clock skews for different flip-flops can 
stagger the switching times of the flip-flops. The 
peak current of the design can be reduced if the 
switching times of most flip-flops are staggered. 
Several researches about using clock skew 
techniques to reduce peak current have been 
studied [3]–[6]. In order to quickly estimate the 
peak current of a design, Y. Takahashi et al. [3] 
proposed a fast current estimation technique. 
Besides the clock skew technique, J.-K. Wu et al. 
[7] proposed long delay flip-flops and used them 
to replace the normal flip-flops for peak current 
reduction.  
Y.-T. Nieh et al. [8] proposed an 
opposite-phase clock scheme to reduce the peak 
current of clock trees. They classified the clock 
buffers of a clock tree into two sets. One set works 
at the same phase of the clock source, and another 
 4
last the algorithm sums up the data of the 
enveloped current waveforms of all gates in D and 
then iD can be got.  
Let PeakI(iD) = Max(v1, v2 ,…, vn), where iD= 
[v1, v2 ,…, vn]. The value of TSPeakI(iD) is k if and 
only if PeakI(iD) = vk. In other words, TSPeakI(iD) 
is the time slot (TS) in which the maximum (i.e. 
peak) current of D appears. Besides, TPeakI(iD) 
denotes the occurrence time of PeakI(iD) in a clock 
period. 
We define that the value of ECW(gk, j) is vj if 
igk= [v1, v2,…, vj,…, vn], where vj is the j-th 
element of igk. Cone(gk) represents the cone of 
gates that are reachable through combinational 
gates from gk. ECW(Cone(gk), j) is vj if iCone(gk) = 
[v1, v2,…, vj,…, vn], where vj is the j-th element of 
iCone(gk). 
Let s be a Vt swap function. We define that 
s(gk) is a high (low) Vt cell if and only if gk is a 
low (high) Vt cell. Note that s(gk) and gk have the 
same layout (except the Vt part). 
B. Algorithms I 
Fig. 2 shows the pseudo code of a heuristic 
algorithm (Algorithm I) for reducing the peak 
current of a design D. The strategy of Algorithm I 
is to change the Vt of a gate that can consume 
power in TSPeakI(iD).  
 In line 2 of the pseudo code of Algorithm I, a 
gate set B = {g'1, g'2,…, g'm} (m ≤ p) is constructed. 
B contains those gates of G that may switch in 
TPeakI(iD). In lines 3−7 of the pseudo code, the 
gain of each gate g' of B for a Vt swap is calculated. 
The gain of g' is a negative infinite value (line 6) if 
replacing g' by s(g') induces any timing violation. 
If the replacement does not induce any timing 
violation, the gain is defined as:  
ECW(g', TSPeakI(iD)) – ECW(s(g'), TSPeakI(iD)) 
In the previous sub-section, we have defined 
the function ECW. Therefore, ECW(g', 
TSPeakI(iD)) is easy to be understood. However, 
the value of ECW(s(g'), TSPeakI(iD)) is undefined 
because the gate s(g') is not a gate of the current 
design D. Now, we define ECW(s(g'), TSPeakI(iD)) 
is the value of vTSPeakI(iD) if is(g') = [v1, v2,…, 
vTSPeakI(iD),…, vn]. The is(g') is got by two steps. The 
first step is to replace the gate g' of D by s(g') for 
constructing a temporary design Dtemp. The second 
step is to calculate the maximum current vector of 
s(g') (i.e. is(g')) in Dtemp under the assumption that 
each Dtemp’s gate except s(g') has the same current 
waveform and propagation delay as its 
corresponding gate in D. In order to get better 
performance, the assumption is essential. Because 
the assumption is rough, the gain function (line 5) 
is an estimation function rather than an exact one. 
The time complexity of calculating ECW(s(g'), 
TSPeakI(iD)) is only O(1). Fig. 3 illustrates 
ECW(g', TSPeakI(iD)) and ECW(s(g'), 
TSPeakI(iD)). 
In line 8 of the pseudo code of Algorithm I, the 
gates of B are sorted by their gain values for 
constructing SB. In lines 10−19, Algorithm I tries 
to temporarily replace g'si by s(g'si) one by one

2.  Construct B = {g'1, g'2,…, g'm}; 
3.  For each cell g' of B {

The waveform of iCone(g'4) is constructed by using 
the data of ig'4, ig'6, and ig'7. We assume that Vt of 
g'4 is high and the propagation delay of g'4 is 4 
time slot units. The delay of gate s(g'4) is assumed 
to be 3 time slot units. Therefore, ∆ for g'4 is 4 
minus 3 (= 1). Fig. 6(b) shows how to calculate 
f (Cone(g'4), ∆, TPeakI(iD)). Fig. 6(c) explains why 
the gain is 80uA when g'4 is replaced by a low Vt 
gate.  
 In line 10 of the pseudo code of Algorithm II, 
the gates of B are sorted by their gain values for 
constructing SB. In lines 12−21, Algorithm II tries 
to temporarily replace g'si by s(g'si) one by one and 
checks whether the replacement can reduce the 
peak current of D. If the replacement can reduce 
the peak current, the algorithm indeed replaces g'si 
by s(g'si) and quits the loop for repeating the next 
outmost iteration (lines 1−22). If there is no 
replacement can reduce the peak current, the 
algorithm terminates. 
 
五、實驗結果  
Our proposed algorithms have been 
implemented as a program (Peak Current Reducer) 
in C programming language on an IBM 
IntelliStation. 
There are ten ISCAS’89 benchmark circuits 
used in the experiment for evaluating our proposed 
technique. All gate level netlists of the benchmark 
circuits used in the experiment are synthesized by 
Synopsys Design Compiler that only uses low Vt 
standard cells for circuit synthesis work. In this 
experiment, the clock period constraint for the 
Design Compiler is very tight. The critical path of 
each synthesized benchmark circuit has a small 
negative slack after the optimization of Design 
Compiler.  
The target library used by Design Compiler is 
a 65nm CMOS standard cell library. The circuits 
of the 65nm standard cells are constructed by 
shrinking the cells of a TSMC 0.13um standard 
cell library.  
Fig. 7 shows the data flow of our peak current 
reduction and characterization programs. The 
current waveform library is constructed by our 
developed characterization program. BPTM [11] is 
used in our characterization program. 
Table I shows the characteristics of the 
benchmark circuits and their experimental results. 
The peak current reduction rate of a benchmark 
circuit is dependent on the delay of the circuit’s 
critical path and the slacks of the circuit’s logic 
gates. If the slack of each cell is zero, our program 
cannot achieve any reduction. Columns 7 and 8 
show the peak current reduction rates for 
Algorithm I and Algorithm II, respectively. 
Column 9 shows the cell swap rate that is defined 
as follows:  
Algorithm I has better results than Algorithm II 
in all benchmark circuits. The reason may be that 
Algorithm II only changes the Vt of a leading gate 
of a cone rather than the Vts of more gates of the 
cone. We will improved the quality of Algorithm II 
and integrate Algorithm I and Algorithm II to be 
one.  
In the experiment, the CPU time of our 
program is large for a large benchmark because we 
do not use an incremental technique for static 
timing analyses and current waveform updating. 
Another reason is that the time slot resolution (= 
1ps) is too small. In the future, we will improve 
the running time of Peak Current Reducer.  
Finally, we compare our experimental results 
with the experimental results of W.-C. D. Lam et 
al. [6] and J.-K. Wu et al. [7] in the four common 
benchmark circuits. The comparison result is 
shown in Table II. Because W.-C. D. Lam et al. did 
not show the CPU times of the benchmark circuits 
in [6], we do not compare and list them in the 
table. 
Our proposed technique has an advantage over 
others because the technique can reduce not only 
peak current but also leakage current. Another

driving strength. Moreover, the leakage current of the 
transistor is in direct ratio to its channel width. Fig. 3 shows 
the relationship between leakage current and transistor 
width of an nMOSFET whose channel length is 65nm and 
whose bias condition is c2. The slope of the line shown in 
Fig. 3 is about 1.07.  
III. TG-BASED LOGIC GATES AND DVL+ GATES 
 A. The Structure of TG-Based Logic Gates 
    A CMOS transmission gate (TG) is constructed by 
connecting an nMOSFET and a pMOSFET in parallel. A 
zero voltage signal is transmitted by the nMOSFET while 
the pMOSFET is responsible for passing VDD.  
We propose a novel three-input TG-based AND gate 
(named TG-AND3X1) as shown in Fig. 4. For achieving 
low power, small area, and high performance, the TG used 
in the AND gate is a hetero-TG rather than a normal TG. It 
must be noted that our AND gate does not contain any 
inverters because an inverter is a high leakage current 
consumer. The transistor count of the gate is 8. That is less 
than the transistor counts (10 and 12) of three-input TG-
based AND gates proposed by D. Markoviü [13] and E. T. 
Lewis [19]. It is easy to design four or more input TG-based 
AND and OR gates based on the structure of our proposed 
three-input TG-based AND gate.  
     The transistor counts of our proposed n-input TG-based 
AND gate and the conventional n-input CMOS AND gate 
are 3ní1 and 2n+2, respectively. Therefore, the transistor 
counts of our proposed 3-input AND gate and a 
conventional three-input CMOS AND gate are both 8. 
Although our 4-input TG-based AND gate has one more 
transistor than the conventional 4-input CMOS AND gate, 
the layout area of our AND gate may be not greater than 
that of the conventional AND gate. The reason is that the 
sizes of some transistors of our AND gate are smaller than 
those of the conventional CMOS AND gate.  
B. Transistor Level Design for TG-Based Logic Gates etc. 
The 65nm transistor level design of our proposed three-
input TG-based AND gate is shown in Fig. 4. In this design, 
the width of nMOSFET 5 is larger than those of the other 
nMOSFETs because the output pin ABC is driven only by 
nMOSFET 5 when AB  is 1. Since pin ABC is 
simultaneously driven by pMOSFET 6 and nMOSFET 8 
when A and B are both 1, the widths of these two 
MOSFETs are smaller than the width of nMOSFET 5. 
Transistors pMOSFET 1, pMOSFET 2, nMOSFET 3, and 
nMOSFET 4 are all small because they only drive internal 
nets of the gate.  
Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of a 65nm AND gate 
(named AND3X1) that is shrunk from a TSMC 0.13um 
CMOS standard cell (AND3X1). In the schematic diagram, 
the widths of pMOSFET 7 and nMOSFETʳ8 are both larger 
than those of the other transistors because these two 
transistors drive the output pin ABC rather than internal nets. 
    From Boolean algebra, we know that AND and OR 
Boolean operations are dual to each other. Therefore, it is 
easy to construct a three-input TG-based OR gate (TG-
OR3X1) basing on TG-AND3X1. 
C. Time and Power Characteristics of TG-Based Logic 
Gates 
The propagation delay of a gate depends on its input 
transition times and the output capacitive loading. Fig. 6 
shows the propagation delay versus the output capacitive 
loading for the TG-AND3X1 (Fig. 4) and the AND3X1 
(Fig. 5). We assume that the input transition times of the 
gates are all 30ps. TG-AND3X1 has significantly less 
propagation delays than AND3X1. 
    Table II shows the leakage current data of TG-AND3X1 
and AND3X1. TG-AND3X1 has less leakage current than 
AND3X1 for all input states. Observing the circuit shown 
in Fig. 5, if A, B, and C are all 0, pMOSFET 1, pMOSFET 
2, pMOSFET 3, and pMOSFET 7 are in condition c4, 
condition c4, condition c4, and condition c2, respectively. 
Based on the knowledge introduced in Section II, we know 
that the leakage currents of pMOSFET 1, pMOSFET 2, and 
pMOSFET 3 can be ignored, and the leakage current 
consumed by pMOSFET 7 is 6.3nA (= 2.021nA * 320nm / 
110nm * 1.07) that is 71.6% of the total leakage current of 
AND3X1. The leakage current of nMOSFET 4, nMOSFET 
5, and nMOSFET 6 are all small because they form a stack

65nm conventional CMOS cells. The other contains not 
only the conventional CMOS cells but also our proposed 
novel cells. The traditional 65nm CMOS standard cells are 
constructed by shrinking TSMC 0.13um standard cells.  
 The experiment uses some representative MCNC 
benchmark circuits to test the benefit of our proposed gates. 
All benchmark circuits are optimized by Power Compiler 
using the same synthesis constraints. The experimental 
results are shown in Table V. The table shows that Power 
Compiler can further reduce leakage current and dynamic 
power from 35.0% to 4.8% (columns 6 and 7) when the 
standard cell library used by Power Compiler contains our 
proposed gates. 
 Fig. 10 shows three circuits that are used to illustrate 
how a logic synthesizer can use our proposed gates to do 
leakage current and dynamic power reduction. The three 
circuits have the same functionality. The circuit shown in 
Fig. 10(a) has the least leakage current and dynamic power 
among the three circuits. Unfortunately, signal OUTPUT1 
of the circuit has too large transition time (Fig. 11). Fig. 
10(b) shows the circuit that is implemented only by the 
conventional CMOS gates. The mixed use of our proposed 
gates (TG-AND3X1s) and the conventional CMOS gates 
(AND3X1s) can achieve the goals of low power 
consumption, high speed, and small transition time. Fig. 
10(c) shows the circuit constructed by the mixed use 
approach that is also used by logic synthesizers for power 
reduction. Fig. 11 shows the simulation waveforms of the 
inputs and the outputs of the three circuits. In this 
simulation, we assume that signals a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h 
are all 1.  
 V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we propose TG-based AND gates, TG-
based OR gates and DVL+ gates. Our proposed gates have 
less leakage currents, less dynamic power consumption, and 
shorter delays than the conventional CMOS gates. Logic 
synthesizers can use them to achieve power reduction.

driving strength. Moreover, the leakage current of the 
transistor is in direct ratio to its channel width. Fig. 3 shows 
the relationship between leakage current and transistor 
width of an nMOSFET whose channel length is 65nm and 
whose bias condition is c2. The slope of the line shown in 
Fig. 3 is about 1.07.  
III. TG-BASED LOGIC GATES AND DVL+ GATES 
 A. The Structure of TG-Based Logic Gates 
    A CMOS transmission gate (TG) is constructed by 
connecting an nMOSFET and a pMOSFET in parallel. A 
zero voltage signal is transmitted by the nMOSFET while 
the pMOSFET is responsible for passing VDD.  
We propose a novel three-input TG-based AND gate 
(named TG-AND3X1) as shown in Fig. 4. For achieving 
low power, small area, and high performance, the TG used 
in the AND gate is a hetero-TG rather than a normal TG. It 
must be noted that our AND gate does not contain any 
inverters because an inverter is a high leakage current 
consumer. The transistor count of the gate is 8. That is less 
than the transistor counts (10 and 12) of three-input TG-
based AND gates proposed by D. Markoviü [13] and E. T. 
Lewis [19]. It is easy to design four or more input TG-based 
AND and OR gates based on the structure of our proposed 
three-input TG-based AND gate.  
     The transistor counts of our proposed n-input TG-based 
AND gate and the conventional n-input CMOS AND gate 
are 3ní1 and 2n+2, respectively. Therefore, the transistor 
counts of our proposed 3-input AND gate and a 
conventional three-input CMOS AND gate are both 8. 
Although our 4-input TG-based AND gate has one more 
transistor than the conventional 4-input CMOS AND gate, 
the layout area of our AND gate may be not greater than 
that of the conventional AND gate. The reason is that the 
sizes of some transistors of our AND gate are smaller than 
those of the conventional CMOS AND gate.  
B. Transistor Level Design for TG-Based Logic Gates etc. 
The 65nm transistor level design of our proposed three-
input TG-based AND gate is shown in Fig. 4. In this design, 
the width of nMOSFET 5 is larger than those of the other 
nMOSFETs because the output pin ABC is driven only by 
nMOSFET 5 when AB  is 1. Since pin ABC is 
simultaneously driven by pMOSFET 6 and nMOSFET 8 
when A and B are both 1, the widths of these two 
MOSFETs are smaller than the width of nMOSFET 5. 
Transistors pMOSFET 1, pMOSFET 2, nMOSFET 3, and 
nMOSFET 4 are all small because they only drive internal 
nets of the gate.  
Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of a 65nm AND gate 
(named AND3X1) that is shrunk from a TSMC 0.13um 
CMOS standard cell (AND3X1). In the schematic diagram, 
the widths of pMOSFET 7 and nMOSFETʳ8 are both larger 
than those of the other transistors because these two 
transistors drive the output pin ABC rather than internal nets. 
    From Boolean algebra, we know that AND and OR 
Boolean operations are dual to each other. Therefore, it is 
easy to construct a three-input TG-based OR gate (TG-
OR3X1) basing on TG-AND3X1. 
C. Time and Power Characteristics of TG-Based Logic 
Gates 
The propagation delay of a gate depends on its input 
transition times and the output capacitive loading. Fig. 6 
shows the propagation delay versus the output capacitive 
loading for the TG-AND3X1 (Fig. 4) and the AND3X1 
(Fig. 5). We assume that the input transition times of the 
gates are all 30ps. TG-AND3X1 has significantly less 
propagation delays than AND3X1. 
    Table II shows the leakage current data of TG-AND3X1 
and AND3X1. TG-AND3X1 has less leakage current than 
AND3X1 for all input states. Observing the circuit shown 
in Fig. 5, if A, B, and C are all 0, pMOSFET 1, pMOSFET 
2, pMOSFET 3, and pMOSFET 7 are in condition c4, 
condition c4, condition c4, and condition c2, respectively. 
Based on the knowledge introduced in Section II, we know 
that the leakage currents of pMOSFET 1, pMOSFET 2, and 
pMOSFET 3 can be ignored, and the leakage current 
consumed by pMOSFET 7 is 6.3nA (= 2.021nA * 320nm / 
110nm * 1.07) that is 71.6% of the total leakage current of 
AND3X1. The leakage current of nMOSFET 4, nMOSFET 
5, and nMOSFET 6 are all small because they form a stack
