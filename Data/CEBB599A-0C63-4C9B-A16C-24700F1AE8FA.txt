 
Abstract 
 
A least-squares finite-element method (LSFEM) for the non-conservative shallow-water equations is 
presented. The model is capable of handling complex topography, steady and unsteady flows, 
subcritical and supercritical flows, and flows with smooth and sharp gradient changes. Advantages 
of the model include sources terms, such as the bottom slope, surface stresses and bed frictions, can 
be handled easily without any special treatment, upwind scheme is no needed, and the resulting 
system of equations is symmetric and positive-definite (SPD) which can be solved efficiently with 
the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The model is verified with flow over a bump, tide 
induced flow, dam-break, oblique hydraulic jump, and expansion wave. Computed results are 
compared with the analytic solution or other numerical results, and show the model is accurate and 
conservative. The model is then used to simulate flow past a circular cylinder. Important flow 
characteristics, such as variation of water surface around the pier and vortex shedding behind the 
pier are investigated. Computed results are compared with other numerical results and experiment 
data, and show good agreement.

2.3 Finite element model 
θ -method is employed for the time-integration. The least-squares discrete finite-element model 
for the shallow-water equations is given by the following discrete variational problem: 
Find ( ),h hh U , such that for all ( ),h hψ V  
( ) ( )( ) ( ), , , ,h h h h h hh ψ ψℜ = ℑU V V  (12) 
We proceed to define a discrete problem by choosing appropriate finite-element subspaces for 
water depth ( )h  and velocity ( )U . There are no restrictive compatibility conditions, such as the 
LBB condition [15, 18], on the discrete spaces, so we choose the same finite-element subspace for all 
variables. 
 
3. Computed Results 
In this section, the developed model is verified by solving some benchmark problems, including both 
steady and unsteady flows, as well as flows with smooth variations and sharp gradient changes. The 
accuracy of the model is demonstrated by comparing the numerical solutions with analytic solutions, 
available numerical results, and/or experimental data. 
 
3.1 Steady Flow over a Bump 
A 1D steady flow in a 25 m long, 1 m wide channel with a bump defined by

is considered, as illustrated in Figure 1. The water level h = 2 m is imposed at downstream boundary, 
and the discharge Q = 4.42 3 /m s  is imposed at the upstream boundary, respectively. 250 x 1 
uniform four-node quadrilateral elements is used. Other parameters used for the simulation are 
length L = 50 m, width B = 1 m, and 0.1 stΔ = . The simulation starts with a constant water level (h 
= 2 m) and discharge (Q = 4.42 3 /m s ). Comparison of the computed steady water surface with the 
analytic solution is plotted in Figure 2, showing an excellent agreement. The quantitative comparison 
with the analytical solution indicates that the maximum relative error for the water depth is smaller 
than 0.331%. In order to quantify the conservative property of the model, the computed discharge 
(mass) is compared with the theoretical one in Figure 3. The maximum relative error is smaller than 
at the center of these eddies become less than 5 m, the initial water depth of the lower basin. The 
form and propagating speed of the waves agree quite well with those obtained by Alcrudo and 
Garcia-Navarro [2], Fennema and Chaudhry [10], Glaister , Mingham [16] and Causon [29]. 
 
3.5 Oblique Hydraulic Jump 
The oblique hydraulic jump resulted from an interaction between a supercritical flow and a 
converging wall deflected through an angle θ  is illustrated in Figure 9. The shock wave is formed 
with an angle of β . In the test, a 24 x 28 four-node quadrilateral elements, shown in Figure 9, is 
used to representing the converging channel where 16oθ =  for the converging wall, and 
0.01 stΔ =  is used for the simulation. The initial condition is a uniform supercritical flow with a 
water depth of 1 m, a flow velocity U of 6.261 m/s, and V of zero. The supercritical flow boundary 
conditions are specified at the upstream boundary. 
Computed results at the steady-state are illustrated in Figure 10. Comparison of the computed 
results at the steady-state with the analytic solution is shown in Table 2. The prediction agrees well 
with the analytic solution. 
 
3.6 Expansion Wave 
The expansion waves are the antithesis of shock waves. An expansion wave emanating from a 
sharp convex corner such as sketched in Figures 11 (b)-(d) is called a centered expansion fan. The 
expansion waves result from an interaction between a supercritical flow and a diverging wall 
deflected through an angle θ . In the test, a 24 x 20 four-node quadrilateral elements, shown in 
Figure 11 (a), is used to represent the diverging channel where 16oθ =  for the diverging wall, and 
0.005 stΔ =  is used for simulation. The initial condition is a uniform supercritical flow with a water 
depth of 1 m, a flow velocity U of 6.261 m/s, and V of zero. The supercritical flow boundary 
conditions are specified at the upstream boundary. 
Computed results at the steady-state are illustrated in Figures 11 (b)-(d). Comparison of the 
computed results at the steady-state with the analytic solution is shown in Table 3. The prediction 
agrees well with the analytic solution. 
 
3.7 Flow past a Circular Cylinder 
Flow past an obstacle is a classical problem in fluid mechanics and fluvial hydraulics. At low 
Re / 45 1U Dρ μ∞= < ± , where U∞  is the upstream inflow velocity and D is the diameter of the 
cylinder, the flow past a circular cylinder exhibits a steady separated solution. As Re 45 1> ± , flow 
becomes periodic with detachment of the free shear layer and the consequent shedding of vortices [9, 
11]. The periodic phenomenon is referred to as the vortex shedding, while the anti-symmetric wake 
flow pattern is normally referred to as, the von Karman vortex street. The vortex shedding is 
characterized by a very-well-defined frequency which is associated with the Stouhal number (St) 
4. Conclusion 
An accurate least-squares finite-element analysis for the 2D shallow-water equations is presented. It 
can handle complex topography, and be used to simulate steady and unsteady flows, subcritical and 
supercritical flows, and flows with smooth and sharp gradient changes. This makes the model have 
potential to model practical flow problems. Numerical experiments, including flow over a bump, tide 
induced flow in a sloping channel, and dam-break, show good agreement with the analytic solution 
or other numerical results. Simulation of flow past a circular cylinder shows that important flow 
characteristics, such as variation of water surface around the cylinder and vortex shedding behind the 
cylinder, are well predicted, comparing with other numerical results and experiment data.
