acquisition stage. The camera observes these feature points and the head pose in camera coordinate 
system can then be determined. Combining the head pose in camera coordinate system and the 
transformation between the camera and MEG device coordinate systems yields the desired coordinate 
system alignment between the head and MEG coordinate systems. To have the ground-truth of source 
positions for accuracy and stability assessment, we performed experiments using phantom data. 
According to the experiment results, we clearly demonstrate the feasibility, stability, and accuracy of 
the proposed camera-guided alignment method. 
2. Methods 
This section describes the procedures of the proposed method for coordinate system alignment in 
detail.  We start with the description of the notations used in this paper. 
2.1. Notations 
CMEG, CCAM, CIMG, COBJ and CHEAD represent the coordinate systems of the MEG device, the 
camera, the image plane in the camera, calibration object, and the subject's head, respectively. In this 
work, we use a phantom as the calibration object. supTsub denotes the transformation from the sub 
coordinate system to the sup coordinate system; for instance, OBJTMEG stands for the transformation 
from the MEG device to calibration object coordinate systems. Here sub and sup could be any one of 
the above defined five coordinate systems. 
2.2. Overview of the Proposed Method 
The goal of this work is to obtain the transformation HEADTMEG used for MEG source estimation. It 
can be decomposed as follows: 
HEADTMEG = HEADTCAM CAMTMEG                                                                               (1) 
 
Once the relative positions between the MEG device and the camera are fixed, the CAMTMEG will be 
invariable. 
Based on this concept, the proposed method is composed of two working stages as shown in Fig. 1.  
All the invariant parameters such as camera intrinsic parameters and CAMTMEG can be obtained in the 
first stage. Camera intrinsic parameters can be estimated by camera calibration techniques. By utilizing 
the concept of transformation decomposition once more, CAMTMEG can be decomposed into the form 
CAMTOBJ OBJTMEG. The calibration object is used as a medium for computing CAMTOBJ and OBJTMEG. A set 
of camera-visible feature points on the calibration object can be used to estimate CAMTOBJ by using pose 
determination technique. Furthermore, HPI coils attached on the calibration object are used to compute 
OBJTMEG by using MEG source localization technique. Since subjects are not involved in this stage at 
all, we refer this stage as calibration, subject-independent stage.

3. Experiments 
In this study, we use a CCD camera (Marlin, ALLIED Vision Tech. GmbH) with 35 mm focal 
length lens, 1280$\times$1024 pixel resolution, which is located around 2.1m far from the MEG 
helmet,  with the phantom employed as a subject. 
The phantom supplied by the manufactory (Neuromag Ltd., Finland) was used to demonstrate the 
accuracy of the present work without human intervention. The fixed current dipoles with stationary     
locations and two-cycle sine waves of duration 120ms were activated individually to generate the 
electromagnetic field. The peak-to-peak current strength of each dipole was set to 100nAm. Four head 
position indicator (HPI) coils (fixed on the phantom) were used to obtain the position of the phantom 
with respect to the sensor array. After well-positioning, the phantom was assumed to keep still within a 
session. For each session, 100 trials were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000Hz with bandpass   
filtering 0.1Hz to 333Hz. The preprocessed data were then used for further localization analysis. 
In this work, the head conductor was adequately assumed a symmetric spherical model both for the 
phantom and human brains. The sources of phantom dipole and N20m SEF were modeled by a single 
ECD model. In the present study, the x, y, z axes indicate the sagittal plane with positive values to the 
right, the coronal plane with positive values to the front, and the axial plane with positive values up, 
respectively. 
A stability test and a accuracy test will verify our system's performance in the experiment. In the 
stability test, according to the method in section 2 to estimate the CAMTMEG, we put the phantom in a 
fixed orientation, and estimate the HEADTMEG with ten trials through HPI and our system. Then calculate 
the standard deviation of the results of each system. 
In the accuracy test, the phantom dipoles are activated to verify the accuracy of the dipole fitting 
under the original HEADTMEG through the HPI and another HEADTMEG which is estimated by our system. 
The re-projection error of the camera calibration (intrinsic parameters and extrinsic parameters) is 
0.1781 pixel. For verifying the stability of the digitizer, we obtain a position of a point by ten times 
through the digitizer, and the standard deviation of the digitizer is [0.0568, 0.04830, 0.0667] in mm, by 
x, y, and z axis. 
3.1. The Stability of CAMTMEG and HEADTMEG 
The CAMTMEG is a important transformation in our work, because it affects the accuracy and the 
stability of HEADTMEG estimated by our work. We execute the calibration stage by ten times, and
