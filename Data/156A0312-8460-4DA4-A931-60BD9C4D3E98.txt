being notified of one＇s movement.  
The cons would be that the leakage of personal 
privacy through the SNS platform, which might result 
in high-tech intelligent commercial crime or physical 
assault. Consequently, by means of this scientific 
digital forensics technology and the associate 
methodology, we can clarify the role of multimedia 
mobile communication devices in high-tech intelligent 
crimes. For the 2 
nd 
 fiscal year, we would like to extend  
the research arena to audio forensics, movie-clip 
forensics, and still pictures forensics  
on multimedia mobile communication devices.

研究計畫中英文摘要 
【計畫中文摘要】 
本研究計畫是透過社交網路服務的平台，在多媒體移動通訊設備尚未喪失電力的情況之下，我們嘗試
去擷取揮發性記憶體中的資料，藉以重建該使用者的網路社交人際關係。這樣子的突破性技術在網路
犯罪日益嚴重的今天，有非常明顯的貢獻。試想在一個刑事案件的犯罪現場，假設我們看到了 Facebook
之圖示，但是使用者卻已經登出了該社交網路服務平台，藉由本實驗的研究方法，可以嘗試去重建使
用者原來可能的網路人際關係，或朋友圈的狀況，進而嘗試去成為破案之關鍵成功因素。這種突破性
的研究，在網路犯罪日益複雜的商業環境中，扮演著非常重要的角色。而透過 Google Maps 或 GPS 導
航軟體之搭配，使用者出現上的實體位置，都可以透過多媒體行動通訊設備，掌握目前使用者的行蹤。
好處是相關物流業者或一般使用者，可以很快地在網路社群上面了解社群中朋友的動向；缺點是個人
隱私可能因此而曝光，進而造成智慧型商務犯罪，或個人因行跡曝光而受到人身攻擊。所以社交網路
服務的平台，透過數位鑑識的科學方式，可以釐清多媒體移動通訊設備在高科技網路犯罪所扮演的角
色。第二年之計劃再延伸到多媒體移動通訊設備中之語音鑑識、短片鑑識、靜態照片鑑識。

【Abstract】 
The spirit of the proposed research is to gather the critical information within the Android multimedia mobile 
communication devices in order to alleviate the mushrooming threat of cyber terrorism. In addition, when the 
cyber terrorism becomes much more mature, the syndicate will definitely try to destroy, hide, eliminate, or 
counterfeit the related digital evidence due to the pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing. Handheld mobile 
communication devices have been the disruptive technologies to commit or launch the cyber terrorist attacks. 
The Android system has been one of the leading operating system for mobile computing devices. 
Unfortunately, the anti-digital forensics of the above gadgets is not easy compared to the Windows based ones. 
Consequently, this research proposes the generic research methodologies to encompass this challenging 
research arena. 
Based on the digital evidences collected in this generic framework, the intelligence agencies or the law 
enforcement ones are capable of alleviating the threatening from cyber terrorism, which might take advantage 
of the ubiquitous computing devices for the purpose of deconstructing the critical infrastructures that are close 
to millions of lives of innocent civilians, whose lives are in danger if they launch the cyber attacks.

報告內容 
【前言】 
本研究計畫的背景，最主要的原因是因為網路犯罪日益增加，而且使用多媒體行動通訊設備在商業的
用途，也大大地提升，有關於網路犯罪的數位鑑識，在先進國家逐漸普及，但反觀國內，檢察官、律
師在數位鑑識方面的認知與接受程度，還有很多改進的空間。本人曾與台中市的律師事務所合作，探
4 
 
演了關鍵角色。當可攜式多媒體通訊裝置在被扣押的同時，由於監管鏈(Chain of Custody)的執行順
序，造成了關鍵數位證據將永遠消失，所有珍貴的揮發性存儲器內的訊息也永遠地消失了。這個不可
逆轉的過程，絕對會影響相關電腦犯罪的承辦與調查。 
本研究的目的在於提供執法單位、相關數位鑑識單位，提供寶貴的鑑識技術與經驗傳承。目前透過社
交網路服務(SNS)平台進行商務運作或個人休閒的服務活動，已形成一股氣候。有越來越多的 SNS 使
用者，在不經意的情況下，造成個人隱私的洩漏，而如此的資訊隱私漏洞，可能造成公司的無形資產
損失或智慧財產權(Intellectual Property，IP)的侵害，甚至遭受人身攻擊。所以，資訊安全的數位
鑑識就扮演著非常重要的角色。數位鑑識的重要性在打擊網路犯罪，已成為先進國家之主流，佔有舉
足輕重的角色。 
【文獻探討】 
就國內、外有關本計劃的研究情況而言，本研究收集了很多國外的數位鑑識的研究方法，其中不乏有
專業期刊、國際會議、專書著作，來加強本研究的背景知識，在本研究的初期階段，本人找尋一些重
要的相關參考文獻，也做成了相關的評述，本人列出了將近有 20 多個參考文獻，可以發現，數位鑑
識在目前研究領域，還算屬於較少而且重要的領域，從國外的學者、研究單位不難發現，相關的數位
鑑識可能因為多媒體行動通訊設備的不同、作業系統的差異、使用者的習慣，都產生數位鑑識在整體
運作上的重要差異性。以下為本研究計劃在提案時，鑽研之相關文獻：

integrated powers from the cyber space with respect to online community via the 
state-of-the-art Web 2.0 applications, which were capable of reflecting disaster 
information in real time for all civilians in Taiwan who wanted to be volunteers 
concerning rescue operations. The effectiveness and efficiency of those volunteers 
were far exceeding than those of the government. Substantively, the above 
phenomenon rigorously drew our attentions. 
Figure. 1. A conceptual framework 
Understanding why people engage in VORAs is an important issue for 
management and practice. Accordingly, this study empirically aims to develop a 
model focusing on examining the antecedents of attitude and behavioral intention 
that cause individuals to voluntarily engage in online rescue behaviors. By integrating 
the theory of planned behavior (TPB) [6,7], technology acceptance model (TAM) [8], 
and ethical decision-making process [9,10,11], this study provides a more grounded 
exploration of VORAs. 
2. Conceptual framework and hypotheses development 
Figure. 1 presents our model of intentions to participate in VORAs. It combines 
elements of TPB, TAM, and ethical decision-making process. This model retains TPB 
[7] as its basic structural core. Attitudes towards participation, subjective norms, and 
perceived behavioral control are viewed as antecedents of intentions to participate in 
VORAs. We include perceived usefulness, moral judgment, and moral obligation as 
the specific beliefs that may influence a volunteer's attitude toward participating in 
VORAs. The TAM regards perceived usefulness as having an impact on attitude [12]. 
3.2 Data collection and sample  
This study employed a cross-sectional Web-based survey method, using 
self-administered electronic questionnaire to verify the theoretical model. Research 
questionnaire was posted in Chinese on the questionnaire collection website 
http://www.my3q.com/, from 1 October to 29 November 2009. The objectives of the 
research were explained and a hyperlink was set up directing interested individuals 
to the Web-based survey. There were 213 surveys returned and 208 surveys were 
valid after excluding those with omissions. The 208 individuals in the sample 
consisted of 148 (69%) males and 60 (31%) females, with an average age of 34 years. 
74% were aged between 20 and 30 and 21% were aged between 30 and 40. Within 
the sample, 18% held a high school diploma and 80% of the respondents were at the 
college level or above. 25% of the respondents were students, and 72% were 
currently employed. Approximately 38% of the respondents used the Internet 
between 2 and 4 hours per day and 49% the respondents used the Internet for more 
than 4 hours per day. 
3.3 Measures 
All constructs were originally adopted from prior studies with contained 
modifications to fit the context of VORAs if necessary. The following measures 
consisted of items with seven-point Likert scales, ranging from (1) strongly disagree 
to (7) strongly agree. The measurement of TPB (attitude, subjective norm, perceived 
behavior control, and intention) was adapted from Hurtz & William [15] to reflect the 
specific target behavior (VORAs). The measurement scales of moral judgment 
adopted in this study were developed by Tan [16]. Moral obligation was measured 
using Beck and Ajzen’s measure [17] of personal feelings of responsibility to perform 
(or not to perform) a certain behavior. No scale existed for perceived usefulness in 
the context of VORAs, so we developed new scales. Perceived usefulness measured 
using a three-item scale focus on attempts to enhance government effectiveness and 
efficiency in rescue activities. We pre-tested the instrument in interviews with 6 
online rescuers who had online rescue experience. We obtained suggestions for 
adaptations to ensure the clarity and appropriateness of items. We revised and 
eliminated several redundant and ambiguous items accordingly. 
3.4 Validation of Measures 
We conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to assess the reliability, 
convergent validity, and discriminant validity for our measurement models [19]. We 
4. Analysis and Results  
The results illustrated in Table 1 were tested using structural equation modeling 
(SEM) in AMOS 7.0 (Arbuckle, 1997). The hypothesized model had a significant 
chi-square (χ²=243.62, df=153, χ²/ df=1.59, p<0.001) and the other indices were good 
enough (GFI=0.891, AGFI=0.854, CFI=0.958, IFI=0.959, RMSEA=0.065) except for GFI. 
The GFI was slightly below the 0.90 benchmark, but it exceeded the cut-off value of 
0.80 [26]. Therefore, there was a reasonable model fit between the research model 
and the empirical data. 
The examination of the structural model involves estimating the standardized 
path coefficients (SPCs). Table 1 presents the results of the structural model 
assessment. All path coefficients, except for the path of perceived behavior control to 
intention, were significant at the 95% level. Hypothesis 1 predicted that each TPB 
construct (attitude towards participation in VORAs, subjective norm, and perceived 
behavioral control) has a significant and positive relationship with the intention to 
participate in VORAs. Hypothesis 1(a) (SPCs = 0.21, p < 0.05) and Hypothesis 1(b) are 
supported (SPCs = 0.35, p <0 .01), but Hypothesis 1(c) is not supported (SPCs = 0.08, 
p < 0.1). Hypothesis 2 predicted that perceived usefulness has a positive effect on 
attitude toward participating in VORAs. Hypothesis 2 is supported (SPCs = 0.46, p < 
0.001).  Hypothesis 3’s prediction is supported (SPCs = 0.29, p < 0.001) based on the 
fact that moral judgment has a positive effect on attitude toward participating in 
VORAs. Hypothesis 4’s prediction that moral obligation has a positive effect on 
attitude toward participating in VORAs (SPCs = 0.25, p < 0.01) is supported. 
Hypothesis 5’s prediction is supported (SPCs = 0.57, p < 0.001) due to the fact that 
moral judgment has a positive effect on moral obligation. Hypothesis 6 predicted 
that moral obligation has a positive effect on intention of participating in VORAs. 
Hypothesis 6 is supported (SPCs = 0.38, p < 0.01). Hypothesis 7 predicted that 
subjective norm has a positive effect on perceived usefulness. Hypothesis 7 is 
supported (SPCs = 0.63, p < 0.001). Hypothesis 8 predicted that subjective norm has 
a positive effect on moral judgment. Hypothesis 8 is supported (SPCs = 0.64, p < 
0.001). In summary, Hypotheses 1(a), 1(b), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are supported. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be more likely to have intentions to participate in VORAs. These findings illustrate 
that the TRA has a better predictive power than the TPB, which adds the perceived 
behavioral control construct to the TRA when we explain behavioral intentions to 
participate in VORAs. These results are consistent with the previous researches that 
established a positive relationship between attitude (subjective norm) and the 
intention to adopt information technology [27] as well as to purchase from a Web 
vendor [28]. No support is found that predicts a positive relationship between 
perceived behavior control and the intention to participate in VORAs. Previous 
researches do not establish a consistent relationship between perceived behavior 
control and intention. Although Chang  [29] and Venkatesh et al. [30] find that 
perceived behavior control is a significant predictor of intention, Riemenschneider et 
al. [27] find that perceived behavior control is not a significant predictor of intention 
in their hypothesized models. A possible explanation is that the uncertainty 
avoidance dimension of cultural differences may be particularly important in this 
study. According to Hofstede [31], Taiwan exhibits a high uncertainty avoidance 
culture, which is less prone to risk taking and may avoid changes. Taiwanese may feel 
overwhelmed with uncertainty of not knowing the results of implement VORAs. 
Therefore, Taiwanese may not be able to determine the importance of participating 
VORAs.  
Secondly, the results show that perceived usefulness, moral judgment, and moral 
obligation have a direct effect on attitude toward participating VORAs. With 
perceived usefulness, moral judgment, and moral obligation, the total variance 
explained in attitude toward participating VORAs is over 86%. These research 
findings enhance our understanding of the specific beliefs that may influence a 
volunteer's attitude toward participating in VORAs. The specific beliefs motivate 
attitudes, which in turn, influence participation intentions in this sample and they 
suggest the following fact:  In order to encourage volunteers to participate in VORAs, 
one must enhance volunteers' specific beliefs. It includes perceived usefulness, moral 
judgment, and moral obligation.  
Thirdly, except for direct effect of subjective norm on intention, the results show 
that subjective norm indirectly influences intention through two paths: one is by 
influencing subjects’ perceptions of how useful VORAs are (the utilitarian path) and 
the other is by influencing their perceptions of the moral judgment associated with 
engaging the VORAs (the ethical decision-making path). In the utilitarian path, the 
results demonstrate that subjective norm influences perceived usefulness, which in 
turn, influences attitude. These results are consistent with previous research that 
established a positive relationship between subjective norm and perceived 
usefulness [32], and they establish a positive relationship between perceived
