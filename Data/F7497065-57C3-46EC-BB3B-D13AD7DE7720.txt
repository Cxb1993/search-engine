輸性質影響 
 
關鍵詞：鎳鐵/氧化鉻雙層薄膜，交換偏壓，磁電阻，雙離子束濺鍍技術。 
 
交換偏壓的主要特徵為磁滯曲線偏移，其為磁性元件 (如硬碟的自旋閥資料讀取頭和
磁性隨機儲存記憶體的自旋穿遂元件)應用之基礎。交換偏壓現象主要是由於鐵磁層與反鐵
磁層介面間的交互作用，且此交互作用力會增加鐵磁層的矯頑磁力。文獻上曾提出許多理

限的偏壓場、反鐵磁層的磁區壁結構存在導致總偏壓場之降低等。就科技應用的觀點而言，
增加偏壓場的強度與增加其溫度的操作範圍是相當重要的。

thin film exchange bias studies due to the coexistence of the magnetoelectric (ME) and the 
exchange bias [15] effect. This combination of effects also exists in the form of nanoparticles 
such as Fe-Cr2O3 [16] and CrO2-Cr2O3 [17]. Recently, J. Dho and co-workers [18] have reported 
the correlation of the exchange bias in NiFe/epitaxial Cr2O3 bilayers with the AF spin 
configuration and found that an out-of-plane component of the AF spin is favorable for a large 
exchange bias. 
Our previous works indicate that the exchange bias in FM/AF systems depends strongly on 
the structures of antiferromagnetic oxides, such as Fe-oxides [19,20], Co-oxides [21-23], 
(Ni,Co)O [24], and (Ni,Fe)O [10,25,26]. In this work, we investigate the different exchange bias 
properties in the NiFe/Cr-oxide system due to the influence of FM (NiFe) and AF (Cr-oxide) 
thicknesses, different percent oxygen contents (%O2/Ar ratio) during deposition, different film 
substrates (e.g., Al2O3(0001)), and annealing the bottom Cr-oxide layer. We find that the range in 
exchange bias effects in NiFe/Cr-oxide bilayers is associated with different microstructures, 
thicknesses (FM and AF), and changes in AF spin orientations due to the substrate used during 
deposition in addition to an annealing process. 
 
II. Experimental Procedure 
A dual ion-beam deposition technique [27] was used to prepare the NiFe/Cr-oxide bilayers 
on thermally oxidized Si(001) substrates or Al2O3(0001) single crystal substrates. A Kaufman 
source was used to focus an argon ion beam onto a commercial Ni80Fe20 (at%) or a Cr target 
surface while the End-Hall source was used to clean or in situ bombard the substrate during 
deposition with mixture of O2/Ar gas that was varied from 8% to 26% O2/Ar. No external field 
was applied during deposition.  Bottom Cr-oxide layers were annealed at 700 °C for 10 minutes 
using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) method and then capped with the top NiFe layer. A JEOL 
(JEM-2010) transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV was used for the 
microstructural analysis. Low temperature magnetic measurements were performed in a 
commercial SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-7) where the bilayer thin-film was 
20 kOe field cooled either parallel or perpendicular to the film plane from 300 K down to 5 K. 
The exchange bias field, Hex, represents the field shift of a hysteresis loop with respect to zero. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
The microstructure of the bottom Cr-oxide (26%O2/Ar) layer was characterized by TEM, as 
shown in Fig. 1. The polycrystalline film (grain sizes ranging from 5 nm to 15 nm) consisted of 
the hcp structure with the lattice constant a~ 5.23 Å and c~ 10.97 Å, as determined by electron 
diffraction patterns in inset of Fig. 1(a). To study the FM/AF exchange bias behavior, the 
Cr-oxide layer was capped with the NiFe layer, as shown by the cross-sectional TEM in Fig. 1(b). 
The NiFe(10 nm)/Cr-oxide(20 nm) bilayers exhibit a smooth interface with surface roughness 
less than 2 nm. 
To gain insight into the origin of the exchange bias, hysteresis loops of NiFe(10 to 50 
nm)/Cr-oxide(20nm) bilayers were measured at 5 K after a +20 kOe FC process.  The results of 
these measurement are shown in Fig. 2. An asymmetric hysteresis loop with the exchange field, 
Hex~ -35 Oe was observed in NiFe(20 nm)/Cr-oxide(20 nm) bilayers [Fig. 2(a)]. In contrast, 
increasing the NiFe thickness to 50 nm, a much more square hysteresis loop with a smaller Hex~ 
Hex has been observed in NiFe/Cr-oxide (annealed 15%O2/Ar, Fig. 4(b)) and NiFe/Cr-oxide 
(annealed 26%O2/Ar, Fig. 4(c)) bilayers, respectively. This is attributed to the improved 
crystallinity in Cr2O3 structures due to annealing, as confirmed by the presence of nanocrystallites 
in electron diffraction patterns of TEM (not shown here).  However, a sudden drop in Hc (~ 50 
Oe) and Hex (~ -5 Oe) was found in NiFe/Cr-oxide (annealed 8%O2/Ar) bilayers, as shown in Fig. 
4(a). The structural phase transformation due to annealing (Figs. 5(b) and 5(d)) gives rise to the 
sudden drop in Hex and Hc since AF Cr structures have been transformed into distorted spinel 
Cr3O4 structures thus decreasing the exchange coupling strength between AF and FM interfaces. 
To probe the exchange bias arising from different type of substrates, NiFe/Cr-oxide 
(26%O2/Ar) bilayers were deposited on the Al2O3(0001) single crystal substrate. The 5 K 
hysteresis loops of NiFe/Cr2O3 bilayers with the applied magnetic field (FC in +20 kOe from 300 
K down to 5 K) either parallel or perpendicular to the film plane are shown in Fig. 6. The 
NiFe/Cr2O3/Al2O3(0001) bilayers exhibit a smaller in-plane Hex//~ -10 Oe [Fig. 6(a)] whereas no 
perpendicular exchange bias (Hex⊥~ 0 Oe) was found in the out-of-plane direction, as shown in 
Fig. 6(b). This indicates the spins between FM NiFe and AF Cr2O3 couple ferromagnetically in 
the film plane, resulting in the negative exchange bias. Surprisingly, a perpendicular exchange 
bias with Hex⊥~ -80 Oe [Fig. 6(b)] was observed in NiFe/annealed Cr2O3/Al2O3(0001) bilayers 
while maintaining a significant Hex//~ -30 Oe in the in-plane direction [Fig. 6(a)]. This 
coexistence of in-plane and perpendicular exchange bias can be attributed to the canted Cr2O3 
spins induced by the Al2O3(0001) single crystal substrate through a rapid thermal annealing 
process, as compared to those of NiFe/Cr2O3 bilayers deposited on the SiO2 substrate (see above). 
Similar results (coexistence of in-plane and perpendicular Hex) have been found in our previous 
work in [Pt/Co]/NiO multilayers [27] where the mechanism is ascribed to the canted FM spins 
(depending on the FM thicknesses) coupled to the AF spins. However, the exchange bias 
mechanism in the present system of NiFe/annealed Cr2O3 bilayers is likely from canted AF Cr2O3 
spins (due to annealing) coupling to the FM spins, as described below. Recently, J. Dho and 
co-workers [18] have reported the correlation of the exchange interaction in NiFe/epitaxial Cr2O3 
bilayers with the AF spin configuration where bilayers were deposited on the Al2O3 single crystal 
substrate with different orientations. They have found that a significant exchange bias only occurs 
on certain Cr2O3 crystal planes with uncompensated surfaces, and the out-of-plane component of 
the AF spin dominates, creating large exchange bias fields. In our NiFe/annealed 
Cr2O3/Al2O3(0001) bilayers, the significant in-plane and perpendicular exchange bias indicates 
the following roles of annealing on the bottom AF Cr2O3 layer: (1) improving the Cr2O3 
crystallinity and thus resulting in the enhanced Hex//, and (2) reorienting the AF Cr2O3 spins (by 
using the Al2O3(0001) substrate) toward the out-of-plane direction and therefore giving rise to the 
significant perpendicular Hex⊥. Thus, a tunable exchange bias in these NiFe/Cr2O3 bilayers has 
been achieved by combining the ion-beam bombardment technique together with the Al2O3(0001) 
substrate through a rapid thermal annealing process. 
 
IV. Conclusion 
We have systematically studied the exchange bias behavior of NiFe/Cr-oxide bilayers in 
terms of FM and AF thicknesses, different percent oxygen contents, the Al2O3(0001) substrate, 
and the annealing process.  The exchange bias field decreases linearly with increasing NiFe

Conference report (MML, Perth, Australia, 10/15-10/19, 2007) 
Prepared by Ko-Wei Lin (林克偉), Dept. of Materials Science and 
Engineering, NCHU  
 
The IEEE MML '07 was held in Perth, Western Australia. The 2007 IEEE MML 
Symposium continues the tradition of giving scientists a single-session venue for the 
presentation of outstanding, cutting-edge research in a relaxed, picturesque setting. 
Past conferences were held in Kyoto 1992, Cambridge 1995, Vancouver 1998, 
Aachen 2001, and Boulder 2004.  
The topics for the conference include both fundamental and applied aspects of 
magnetic metallic multilayers. The subject matter spans the range from devices to 
fundamental properties. Areas of emphasis are: 
• spin injection and spin-dependent tunneling;  
• magnetization dynamics and exchange bias;  
• magnetic recording media and patterned elements;  
• nanostructures and multiferroic materials;  
• biomedical applications. 
 
The program is as following pages. We have contributed one poster paper: Exchange 
bias in NiFe/Cr-oxide thin-film bilayers. The manuscript is attached in the report as 
well.
