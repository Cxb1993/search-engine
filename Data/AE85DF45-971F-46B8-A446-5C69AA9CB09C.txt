我們將鎖定的研發技術是以駐波振盪器為
主，結合切換傳輸線長度之技術(類似我們過

英文摘要
This one-year research project (originally in
conjunction with the main project“ Research on
60-GHz CMOS RF Transceiver Integration
Technology for Millimeter-wave WPAN Appli-
cation”) plans to develop a 60-GHz voltage
controlled oscillators (VCO) and frequency
synthesizers – the key components of the RF
front-end circuit for 60-GHz applications. This
sub-project particularly aims for the development
of high-performance CMOS VCO’ s suitable
for the 60-GHz Wireless Personal-Area-Network
(WPAN) communication system. This project
also aims for the design of high-performance and
high-integration millimeter wave (mm-Wave)
signal generator by integrating the related
phase-locking schemes obtained from the main
project. We are going to use 0.18 μm, 0.13 μm,
and 0.09 μmRF CMOS process technologies to
輸、無線Gigabit 乙太網路、辦公室會議現場
轉播…等)[5]-[6]。
在 CMOS 製 程 中 的 矽 基 底 (Silicon
Substrate)是屬於較高導電性特質的材料(與
GaAs 等Ⅲ-Ⅴ族半導體基材的絕緣性比較)，
所以利用CMOS 製程來實現電路設計時，需
要額外考量材質的損耗問題[4]。就60-GHz 收
發機系統的電路設計挑戰而言，除了上述矽基
底之損耗外，另外一個重要的因素是電晶體原
件本身的特性。傳統Ⅲ-Ⅴ半導體電晶體元件
在微波及毫米波的應用中元件特性尚有絕對
的優勢；但考慮製作成本，則低單價的矽基底
半導體製程是不二之選擇。考慮系統單晶片
(SystemOn Chip，SOC)整合的趨勢，再加上製
程技術之進步、低成本的考量之下，用CMOS
製程儼然成為一種自然演變的法則[8]。
我們知道60-GHz WPAN 的市場應用正
要起步。在60-GHz CMOS射頻收發機系統
上，有三個主要關鍵區塊：即天線、收發機前
端電路，和60-GHz 局部振盪訊號源。此外還
有增強電路特性的一個重要關鍵技術是晶片
嵌入式(On-chip)毫米波濾波器的設計。在計畫
的規劃中，收發機架構系統採用第一次降頻至
5 GHz 的架構，預設提供 5 GHz 的第一次中
頻訊號。假設預定每個通道頻寬500 MHz，則
共有14 個通道。二次降頻架構之考量，係主
要搭配降頻後我們將可以應用現有5-GHz 頻
段或UWB (3.1-GHz-10.6-GHz) 等熟知的系統
通訊頻段的架構，以省去開發電路之成本與開
發之時效，並達共存系統的應用目標[7]。如圖
A，係為此二次降頻的系統架構示意圖。考慮
接收機在第一次降頻後的中頻輸出，若要固定
在5-GHz的頻帶上，則第一局部振盪訊號
(LO1)，則需分布在 52.25 GHz ~ 58.75 GHz
(或62.25GHz ~68.75-GHz)之間，且可切換成14
個載波頻率。我們知道這樣的頻率訊號源可能
與3.1-GHz~10.6-GHz 之UWB 系統之訊號源
設計概念相同[9]-[11]。

三、研究方法及成果
本研究計畫第一年的執行目標，在開發應
用於60-GHzWPAN 的CMOS 20-/30-/60-GHz
壓控振盪器電路。利用0.18-μm和0.13-μmRF
CMOS 製程來實現製作振盪器電路。由於應
用頻率高達7-GHz，我們將評估傳統切換電感
與電容的LC 壓控振盪器的可行性或利用傳輸
線設計駐波振盪器電路來實現。我們並將創新
開發可切換式傳輸線的設計來改善可調變頻
率範圍。使用0.18-μmRF CMOS 製程主要是
可以加速驗證創新架構的可行性。有效的創意
電路架構與設計技巧在經過驗證後，將轉移至
0.13-μm製程上。在第一年中，我們也將利用
0.13-μm 製程研製相關倍頻/除頻電路與頻率
合成器電路。
本研究計畫第二年的執行目標如下。根據
總計畫目標在第一年的研發成果驗證並決定
後的架構考量，研發製作相關的鎖相迴路，以
產生穩定的局部振盪訊號。同時根據架構，也
將設計研製訊號產生源電路。此訊號產生源電
路係撘配 IEEE802.15.3c 標準下，這個訊號產
生源或將類似 UWB 系統中之訊號產生源
[9]-[11]。而我們應用已有的研究成果[12]重新
作一個頻譜規劃，可以產生14 個通道載波頻
率的訊號源電路。
本研究計畫第三年的執行目標在執行
60-GHz 鎖相迴路；並與總計畫研發成果中的
收發機電路作整合工作。並若有機會獲得
0.09-μmRF CMOS 製程資源時，預計將此線
路設計轉移至0.09-μm製程。
在第一年裡，此計畫中預定完成的 20 GHz
或是 30 GHz 的 VCO，最後我們是以駐波振盪器
的方式來實現[13]，由電磁學的理論可得知，
當反向的波與順向的波相遇時，駐波便會產
生。而駐波最大的特點，在於波的相位和位置
無關。改變的僅有波的振幅。換句話說，波在
SWO 中是沒有傳遞的(Traveling-wave VCO 的
波是在前進的)。圖 B 為在 4 分之波長線駐波
如何形成的示意圖，圖 C與圖 D分別為此電路
的量測結果以及此晶片的實際電路圖。

In this paper we demonstrate a 27-GHz low phase noise
standing-wave VCO design utilizing CPS structure over
floating metal strips. The circuit is implemented by a 0.18 μm
CMOS technology. Using a 3.3-V varactor device, the tuning
range can be up to 1.29 GHz by applying a 3.3V tuning
voltage. The measured phase noise at 1 -MHz offset ranges
from -113 dBc/Hz to -116 dBc/Hz in the whole tuning range.
The calculated FOM is -191 dB. .
II. DESIGN OF THE OSCILLATOR
A. General Considerations and Circuit Structure
The standing-wave oscillator has been studied in detail in [5].
A strip line with a length of odd-multiple λ/4and grounded at
one end will produce a maximum voltage swing at another
opened end, when excited at a given frequency. As shown in
Fig. 2, a standing-wave can be formed. If a cross-coupled
transistor pair is connected to the opened ends of two striplines
in coplanar, an oscillation can be sustained at the specified
frequency according to the length of the striplines. The
oscillation frequency of such SWO is decided by the formula as
  CPSvarpd
8
0
LCC2π
1
ε
103
λ
1

f (1)
where λis the wavelength and dε is the dielectric constant.
Although the CPS structure serves as a resonator rather than
as an inductor, the equivalent circuit of the SWO is still
assumed to be like that of a traditional LC-tank oscillator. LCPS
is the equivalent inductance of the coplanar striplines. Cp is the
total parasitic capacitance and Cvar is the capacitance of the
varactor used for fine frequency tuning.
Fig. 2 Illustration of standing wave formation in a quarter -wave
stripline.
Fig. 3 shows the schematic diagram of the standing-wave
VCO in our design. The CPS structure is used in the VCO
core to replace a traditional on-chip differential inductor. In
order to increase the output power, we utilize the so -called
Folded Micro-Strip Line (FMSL) [7] as the inductive load of
the output buffer. The device parameters of our VCO design
are listed in Table I. Both R1 and R2 are off-chip resistors for
current-tuning when doing the measurement.
Table I. The device parameters of our VCO design.
The accumulation-mode high-voltage MOS varactors are
utilized for the frequency tuning. Such high-voltage MOS
varactors can be operated under 3.3 V. Therefore, the tuning
range of our VCO can be extended due to higher tuning
voltage (up to 3.3 V). Besides, we find that the Q-factor of
these high-voltage varactor get improved when operated above
20 GHz.
Fig. 3 Schematic diagram of the standing-wave VCO.
B. High-Q CPS Structure Design
The loaded Q-factor of the resonator will dominate the
phase noise performance of the oscillator. Especially, the Q -
factor of a conventional on-chip inductor is the critical issue in
mm-wave operation because of the serious substrate loss.
Utilizing the Patterned Ground Shielding (PGS) methodology
[8] can improve the Q-factor of the inductor because of the
less substrate loss. However, the lower self-resonant frequency
will limit the use of inductor. Inherently, the resonator using
the CPS structure would have a better Q-factor because of the
coplanar structure. If the ground plane of the CPS structure is

IV. CONCLUSION
A 27-GHz low phase-noise CMOS standing-wave VCO is
implemented for the millimeter-wave applications. By
combining the floating metal strips and coplanar-stripline with
optimum physical size, a high-Q CPS resonator can be
achieved. The measured phase noise at 1-MHz and 10-MHz
offset are about -115 dBc/Hz and -134 dBc/Hz, respectively.
The frequency tuning range of Ka-band(27-GHz) VCO is from
26.26 GHz to 27.55GHz and the total tuning range is about
1.29GHz. The calculated FOM is -191 dB.

Figure 1 The schematic of the VCO.
To achieve the operation frequency in the Ku-band, the
product of inductance and capacitance of the tank is much
smaller than that for the traditional WLAN bands. The layout
of inductor is thus considered in a single loop structure. Since
the raise of operation frequency, the substrate losses of the
inductor and the varactor become more serious. Therefore,
there is an optimal trade-off between the inductance and the
capacitance. In our design, a proper choice of L1 = 0.4 nH and
Cvar1 = 0.1 pF at zero junction bias to guarantee the Q-factor of
the inductor greater than 10 and the total tuning range
approaching to 1 GHz. The tuning range is also traded off
between the varactor capacitance and the parasitic junction
capacitances of the cross-coupled pairs. The parasitic
capacitance would decrease the tuning range and the VCO
sensitivity, and thus possibly enhance the phase noise.
However, it also degrades the effective Q-factor under high
operation frequency. After optimization, a tuning range of 900
MHz and a phase noise of -110 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset are
accomplished.
2.2. Divider
Conventional true single-phase clocked (TSPC) frequency
dividers are seldom used for the above-GHz applications.
Though the Current-Mode Logic (CML) [7] can be operated in
the GHz range, the power consumption becomes a limitation
factor for a real low power design. The analog frequency
dividers like injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFD) [5]
and Miller dividers [8] are the reported solutions. However,
the Miller divider structure [8] is more complicated than that
of an ILFD [5]. Therefore, we choose the ILFD to realize the
low-power integration of the frequency divider.
Figure 2 The schematic of the ILFD.
Figure 2 shows the schematic of the ILFD in our design.
The incident signal generated by the VCO injects into the
gates of M17 and M18, where M18 is a dummy device to
prevent from the loading mismatch for the VCO core [9]. The
incident signal is delivered through M17 with a sub-unity gain
to the common source node of the cross-coupled pair M9 and
M10, and then forces the cross-coupled pair oscillated at half
of the injection frequency. By properly choosing the
composition values of the inductor L2 and the varactor Cvar2 to
resonant around at half of the injection frequency, the divider
can be locked with a relatively low level of incidence power.
To enlarge the locking range of the divider under a low
injection level, the varactor Cvar2 is properly selected to let the
free-running oscillation frequency of the divider can track the
incident frequency.
The locking capability of the divided-by-two divider is
evaluated by the oscillation-sustaining range with the
frequency difference (that is, the frequency offset Δω)
between half of the incident input signal (
iω/ 2 ) and the output
free-running oscillation signal rω [5]. The phase-limited
locking range can be expressed as
2Q
VH
k
ω
Δω i0
r
 (1)
where k is the second-order nonlinearity coefficient of the
divider circuitry; Vi is the amplitude of incident signal; H0 is
the maximum coefficient of the transfer function of the LC-
tank in the divider; and Q is the quality-factor of the LC-tank.
As (1) suggests, the locking range can be increased by
increasing either H0/Q or the incident amplitude Vi. Usually,
utilizing a larger inductance would increase the H0/Q (= Lω )
value. This implies the adoption of NMOS-only cross-coupled
pair M9 and M10 in our design with a minimum parasitic
capacitance allows a greater inductance value and thus a wider
tuning range.

4. Conclusion
In this work, the integration design and implementation of a
complementary CMOS VCO and injection-locked frequency
divider were presented. By choosing the proper topologies for
the VCO core and the divider core, the total power
consumption of 7.3 mW were achieved at a 1.4 V supply
voltage. The measured phase noise of the Ku-band VCO is -
110 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset in the whole 900-MHz tuning
range. The power consumption is 3.1 mW. The measured
locking range of the divider is 400 MHz under the incident
signal directly from the VCO. Such power consumption and
phase noise performance can be incorporated in a PLL to
realize a high-performance Ku-band frequency synthesizer.

Abstract — This work presents a 27-GHz low phase-noise
standing-wave voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) design with
the folded microstrip line structure over floating metal strips .
Because the floating metal strips serve to retard the wave, the
length of microstrip line (and thus the overall layout area) can be
further reduced at a given frequency. Meanwhile, the floating
metal strips reduce the substrate effect and improve the Q -factor
of the microstrip line. The measurement results exhibit a tuning
range from 26.26 GHz to 26.80 (27.55) GHz with the tuning
voltage rising from 0.1 V to 1.8 (3.3) V. The measured phase -noise
levels are around -115 dBc/Hz and -134 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz and 10-
MHz offset, respectively. The DC power consumption of the
oscillator core is 17.7 mW at the supply voltage of 1.8 V. The
figure of merits (FOM) of this VCO is -191 dB.
Index Terms — VCO, standing-wave oscillator, folded
microstrip line, floating metal strips, millimeter wave.
I. INTRODUCTION
The implementation of integrated circuits operated at
millimeter-wave frequencies for high-data-rate wireless
communication systems becomes feasible with the advanced
deep-submicron CMOS technology. Interestingly, from the
viewpoint of operation bands available, it is found that some
communication systems may be possibly coexisted by simply
integrating a frequency conversion stage. Since the most part
of circuit architecture can be reused, the chip cost will be
reduced. For example, as shown in Fig. 1 (a), the system in 60-
GHz Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) band and the
system in 3 –10 GHz Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) are with a
frequency difference of 54 GHz. Another example is the
system in ISM 24-GHz band and 2.4-GHz band, as shown in
Fig. 1 (b). The frequency difference is about 26 –27 GHz.
Evidently, a 27-GHz VCO with a 1-GHz tuning range could be
very helpful to the millimeter-wave /RF co-existence systems
design.
In the recent years, LC-tank VCOs are widely used for the
wireless communication systems operated in the tens of
gigahertz [1]-[3]. As the operation frequency comes into the
millimeter-wave regime, owing to the device limitations on the
parasitics and the insufficient transconductance, the phase
noise of the traditional LC-tank VCOs suffers from a serious
degradation. The on-chip inductor also suffers from a serious
substrate loss if the operation frequency is raised. Wave -based
oscillators have been reported to improve the loss issue caused
by the traditional inductor [4]-[6]. The rotary traveling wave
oscillator [4] utilized a differential Mobius transmission line
structure and multi cross-coupled inverter stages. Therefore,
the total power and the chip area consumptions were
considerably large. The standing-wave oscillators (SWO) [5]
made use of a quarter-wavelength(λ/4)-based coplanar stripline
(CPS) structure to replace the traditional on-chip inductor. For
the further Q-factor enhancement of the microstrip lines, the
methodology of wave-adaptive tapered-CPS is utilized [5].
Although the reported phase noise of the oscillator integ rated
with a tapered-CPS is 8 dB reduction at 1 MHz offset as
compared to that with the uniform-CPS [5], the design work
and the layout will becomes more complicated and thankless.
The uniform-CPS structure accompanied with floating metal
strips [6] can provides the advantages of design simplicity and
low substrate loss.

referred to the silicon substrate, the similar concept of
shielding with floating metal strips is also applied [9] to reduce
the substrate loss. Not only the Q-factor can be enhanced, but
also the resonator size can be shrunk because of the slow -wave
behavior from the floating metal strips [6].
Fig. 4 illustrates the CPS resonator structure adopted in our
VCO design. The optimization of this structure is conducted
with the full-wave EM simulator Agilent Momemtum. The Q-
factor of the CPS resonator is affected by the width ( w) of
stripline, the spacing (s) between the two striplines, the width
(wd) of the floating metal strip and the spacing (sd) between
any two floating metal strips. After optimization, with w = 55
μm, s = 65 μm and wd = sd = 1 μm, the Q-factor of the
resonator is 28. The physical length of CPS can be reduced to
150μm (≈0.075λ) referred to the frequency of 27 GHz.

III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
Fig. 5 shows the chip microphotograph of the VCO. The
total chip size was 0.6 × 0.8 mm2. The chip was wire-bonded
to a Roger-4003c PCB for measurement. Furthermore, the RF
output pads (Vo+ and Vo-) are wire-bonded directly to a
transmission line connecting with the SMA connector. In order
to compensate the power losses from the PCB, the connectors
and the cables, a low noise pre-amplifier (with 14-dB Gain)
was utilized in our experiment. The output spectrum was
measured by a spectrum analyzer (Agilent E4448A). The phase
noise was characterized in two ways: When the oscillation
frequency is smaller than 26.5 GHz, the phase noise is
characterized directly by a signal source analyzer (Agilent
E5052A) accompanied with a microwave down-converter
(Agilent E5053A); While as the oscillation frequency greater
than 26.5 GHz, the output frequency was divided by two firstly
with a low noise divider (≦ 40 GHz, PN = -153dBc/Hz @ 10
KHz) and then fed to the signal source analyzer.
The oscillator core drew a current of about 9.84 mA from
the supply voltage of 1.8V. The power consumption was 17.7
mW. The output buffer stage drew a total cur rent of about
12.46 mA in order to drive the 50Ωload. The measured phase
noise at Vtune = 3.1V is shown in Fig. 6 where the values at 10-
KHz, 100-KHz, 1-MHz and 10-MHz offset are about -65.2
dBc/Hz, -71.8 dBc/Hz, -115 dBc/Hz and -134 dBc/Hz,
respectively. In Fig. 7, the phase noise at 1-MHz offset and the
output frequency in the whole tuning range are shown.
Theoretically, the phase noise can be enhanced with 6 dB with
a divide-by-two circuit. The data measured with a frequency
divider has already been calibrated. The total tuning range is
about 1.29 GHz.

二、 與會心得
此次至大陸參與 ICICIC2008 研討會，是學生首次踏出國門也是第一次參與國際性研討會，因此抱著又
緊張又興奮的心情。雖然是在大陸舉辦，但是參與的人員來自全世界各地皆有，英文變成了主要溝通的語
言。不管是發表論文，提問或是與其他學者討論，都需要使用英文來溝通，算是一個新的體驗。
此篇論文主要是在射頻電路領域，發表在此研討會的射頻電路應用於無線控制系統部分。所以電路相
關的論文相對來說沒有那麼多，絕大部分論文為通訊控制系統等等。但是強調與電路與系統間的整合，這
是學生以往較少去注意到的問題，也讓我受益良多。經由此行發現了系統與電路之間密不可分的關係，如
果單純的只瞭解系統或是只瞭解電路，是無法完成一個高效能的產品與成果。電路設計者與系統規劃者都
必須知道對方的想法，才有辦法得到最好效益。因此除了學生發表這個 session，學生也參與了其他通訊、
控制、電腦資訊等等的會議。試圖去瞭解到各個系統的特性、需求等等。特別是系統在電路上的瓶頸，這
是身為電路設計者一定需要去瞭解到的，也是從事電路研究者必須去努力的目標，唯有更好的電路特性，
才能減低系統規劃者的限制增加系統彈性。
Figure 1 The schematic of the VCO.
To achieve the operation frequency in the Ku-band, the
product of inductance and capacitance of the tank is much
smaller than that for the traditional WLAN bands. The layout
of inductor is thus considered in a single loop structure. Since
the raise of operation frequency, the substrate losses of the
inductor and the varactor become more serious. Therefore,
there is an optimal trade-off between the inductance and the
capacitance. In our design, a proper choice of L1 = 0.4 nH and
Cvar1 = 0.1 pF at zero junction bias to guarantee the Q-factor of
the inductor greater than 10 and the total tuning range
approaching to 1 GHz. The tuning range is also traded off
between the varactor capacitance and the parasitic junction
capacitances of the cross-coupled pairs. The parasitic
capacitance would decrease the tuning range and the VCO
sensitivity, and thus possibly enhance the phase noise.
However, it also degrades the effective Q-factor under high
operation frequency. After optimization, a tuning range of 900
MHz and a phase noise of -110 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset are
accomplished.
2.2. Divider
Conventional true single-phase clocked (TSPC) frequency
dividers are seldom used for the above-GHz applications.
Though the Current-Mode Logic (CML) [7] can be operated in
the GHz range, the power consumption becomes a limitation
factor for a real low power design. The analog frequency
dividers like injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFD) [5]
and Miller dividers [8] are the reported solutions. However,
the Miller divider structure [8] is more complicated than that
of an ILFD [5]. Therefore, we choose the ILFD to realize the
low-power integration of the frequency divider.
Figure 2 The schematic of the ILFD.
Figure 2 shows the schematic of the ILFD in our design.
The incident signal generated by the VCO injects into the
gates of M17 and M18, where M18 is a dummy device to
prevent from the loading mismatch for the VCO core [9]. The
incident signal is delivered through M17 with a sub-unity gain
to the common source node of the cross-coupled pair M9 and
M10, and then forces the cross-coupled pair oscillated at half
of the injection frequency. By properly choosing the
composition values of the inductor L2 and the varactor Cvar2 to
resonant around at half of the injection frequency, the divider
can be locked with a relatively low level of incidence power.
To enlarge the locking range of the divider under a low
injection level, the varactor Cvar2 is properly selected to let the
free-running oscillation frequency of the divider can track the
incident frequency.
The locking capability of the divided-by-two divider is
evaluated by the oscillation-sustaining range with the
frequency difference (that is, the frequency offset Δω)
between half of the incident input signal (
iω/ 2 ) and the output
free-running oscillation signal rω [5]. The phase-limited
locking range can be expressed as
2Q
VH
k
ω
Δω i0
r
 (1)
where k is the second-order nonlinearity coefficient of the
divider circuitry; Vi is the amplitude of incident signal; H0 is
the maximum coefficient of the transfer function of the LC-
tank in the divider; and Q is the quality-factor of the LC-tank.
As (1) suggests, the locking range can be increased by
increasing either H0/Q or the incident amplitude Vi. Usually,
utilizing a larger inductance would increase the H0/Q (= Lω )
value. This implies the adoption of NMOS-only cross-coupled
pair M9 and M10 in our design with a minimum parasitic
capacitance allows a greater inductance value and thus a wider
tuning range.
