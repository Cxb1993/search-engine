Figure 1. The mechanism of spindle integrated dynamic FEM model
1 Introduction
Although theories of high-speed metal cutting were reported in the 1930s [1], machine
tools capable of achieving these cutting speeds did not exist commercially until the 1980s
[2, 3]. This late acceptance was mostly due to the performance and reliability problems
caused by complicated high-speed effects, such as chatter and premature spindle bearing
failures [4]. Therefore, to realize the advantages of high-speed machining, it is of advantage
to consider these high speed effects in the design stage.
The dynamics mechanism of high-speed motorized spindles is highly complicated, which
consists of several thermal and mechanical interactive phenomena with non-linear and closed-
loop natures. For design purposes, Fig. 1 shows the essential physical models required to
describe the dynamic properties of spindle systems, as well as major independent variables.
In this paper, the integrated FEM model developed by Lin et al. [5] is applied in the
design of high-speed motorized spindle bearing systems , where the front bearing pairs are
preloaded with springs and a hydraulic pump and the rear bearing pairs are preloaded with
spacer, to investigate the effects of design parameters on the dynamics of high-speed spindle-
bearing systems considering high-speed effects.

based on the methodology that one design parameter is changed at a time while the other
parameters remain unchanged. The focused DP is varied from 90 percents to 110 percents of
their initial values and the system natural frequencies are obtained by using the integrated
FEM model for speeds from 0 rpm to 25,000 rpm, with 5,000 rpm increment. The results
are shown only for the natural frequencies of forward mode to facilitate demonstration and
analysis.

DP1 Bearing initial preload
DP2 Spacing between the bearings of front bearing set
DP3 Spacing between the bearings of rear bearing set
DP4 Spacing between the front and rear bearing sets
DP5 Spacing between the middle line of front and rear bearing sets and the free end of cutter
DP6 Material of the spindle shaft
DP7 Diameters of the spindle shaft
DP8 Length of the spindle shaft
From Fig. 3 we can find that, increases of DP1 cause natural frequencies of both modes
increased almost linearly; natural frequencies of both modes increase linearly with respect to
the increases of DP2; the changes of DP3 do not significantly influence the natural frequencies
of the system; DP4 affects the natural frequencies of first and second modes in opposite ways;
the natural frequencies of both modes decrease as DP5 increases; the natural frequencies
increase linearly with DP6; the natural frequencies for first mode of the spindle system
decrease almost linearly with the increases of DP7; the system natural frequencies decrease
with increases of DP8.
4 Analysis of the DPs’ Effects
In last section, we show that the DPs have diverse impacts on the system dynamics,
therefore, it is important to consider influences of these DPs carefully during spindle system
designs. Before applying these results, we must realize the relative importance of DPs first.
The extreme values of natural frequencies of all DPs are sampled with the ratios equal to
1.1 and 0.9 from the figures in Fig. 3 at speeds 0 rpm and 25,000 rpm, representing without
or with high-speed effects. Then, the accumulated data are transformed into percentages
of differences to their initial values. After applying the same procedure to all DPs, we
can obtain the results as shown in Table 2. From the table, it can be discovered that the
corresponding ratios exceed 1 include DP4 (ratio 1.1) and DP8 (ratio 0.9 & 1.1) on both
modes ,and DP5 (ratio 0.9 & 1.1) only on second mode.

The results in Table 2 can be demonstrated with radar charts to facilitate relative im-
portance comparisons of the DPs. Fig. 4 show the results for the first and second modes.
From the above analysis, we can find that if we consider the system natural frequencies
as the design target, the important design parameters are spacing between the front and
rear bearing sets (DP4) and spacing between middle line of the two bearing sets and the free
end of cutter (DP5) for both modes, and length of the spindle shaft (DP8) for only second
mode, which confirms the results of [6–8].
5 Applications of the DP Charts on Spindle System Design
In section 3, the effects of the 8 DPs on natural frequencies are examined individually.
However, they are not totally independent. Relationships between the DPs can be demon-
strated by a design structure matrix (DSM) [9], as shown in Table 3. From the table, we
can find dependencies of these DPs, where DP1, DP6, and DP7 are independent parameters,
and DP2, DP3, DP4, DP5, and DP8 are dependent to each other as the manner shown in
Fig. 5.

New spindle system designs
In new spindle system design. all parameters are justifiable. If the natural frequency of
first mode is the major design requirement, values of the parameters can be determined refer-
ring Fig. 4 by selecting symbols with positive signs, that is, DP1(1.1), DP2(1.1),DP3(1.1),
DP4(0.9), DP5(0.9), DP6(1.1), DP7(0.9), and DP8(0.9). On the other hand, production

cost is another critical performance measurement of spindle system designs. The design
engineers usually want to use less materials to satisfy the cost criteria, which means that
DP7 and DP8 need to be as small as possible. It is interesting that the picks for the optimal
first mode natural frequencies are consistent with the cost requirements. Dependencies of
the parameters have to be considered here carefully. If the parameters are independent to
other parameters, they can be just set with the favorite values directly. The independent
parameters include DP1, DP7, and DP8. However, for those dependent parameters, they
have to be specified following the sequence as shown in Fig. 5. Under this condition, the
natural frequency of first mode for the optimal spindle system design is 1,138 Hz for speed
25,000 rpm.
Modification of current spindle systems
In the second design problem, we suppose that the spindle systems have been built,
or all the parts have already been shipped to the assembly line. Under this scenario, the
spindle system can only be modified by adjusting the arrangement of the bearings, which
corresponds to the parameters DP2, DP3, DP4, and DP5. Among these DPs, from Table
3, we can find that the DP4 is relatively important. Therefore, we can decrease DP4 by 10
percents first, and the new natural frequency is 865 Hz for 25,000 rpm.. However, the DP2,
DP3 and DP5 can also be adjusted as necessary, and the results are listed in Table 4 with
respect to the relative importance, where shows the highest possible natural frequency is 951
Hz for speed 25,000 rpm. Note that the DPs also have to be determined in sequence as Fig.
5 shown.

6 Conclusion
In this research, an integrated FEM model of high-speed spindle system for evaluating
system dynamic characteristics is developed and in the design sensitivity analysis of spindle
systems. The influences of eight DPs on system natural frequencies considering high-speed
effects have been demonstrated. The following conclusions can be induced from the results:
1. The vital design parameters to the system dynamics include spacing between the front
and rear bearing sets, spacing between middle line of the two bearing set and the free
end of cutter, and length of the spindle shaft.
2. The uncritical design parameters to the system dynamics include bearing initial preload,
spacing between the bearings of rear bearing sets, and diameters of the spindle shaft.
3. Under manufacturing capability constraints, the highest possible first mode natural
frequency is 1138 Hz for speed 25,000 rpm.
4. Under manufacturing capability constraints, the highest possible first mode natural
frequency of modified built spindle systems is 951 Hz for speed 25,000 rpm.
