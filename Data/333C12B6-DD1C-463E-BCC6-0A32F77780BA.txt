Abstract  
Metamodels are generally used as substitute for numerical models which require extensive 
computation. In this study artificial neural networks (ANNs) constructed from the sampled 
bearing performance data were evaluated for the replacement of a thermohydrodynamic 
lubrication model. The bearing model is represented by two coupled partial differential equations, 
a simplified generalized Reynolds equation and a transient 3-D energy equation. 
Root-mean-square error and maximum/minimum absolute errors of validation points were 
employed to evaluate the accuracy of the ANNs’ prediction. It is demonstrated that a properly 
selected neural network metamodel can determine the slider performance almost instantly with 
little sacrifice of solution accuracy. A similar procedure can be employed to build metamodels for 
solving other computationally intensive problems in the field of computational Tribology.  
 
KEY WORDS: artificial neural network, metamodel, thermohydrodynamic lubrication 
1. Introduction 
In the field of computational Tribology, numerical models are widely used to analyze or 
simulate the performance of systems of interest. A single evaluation of such analysis may take 
hours or days to complete. Despite the steady growth of computing power of PCs and 
workstations, tribological analyses continue to advance in complexity. The demand for 
high-fidelity simulations also results in computationally expensive calculations. Therefore the 
computational costs in these applications may limit their usability to realistic simulations (e.g., 
complex optimum designs or reliability analyses) other than some simple parameter study.  
With the help of parallel computing of some form a tribological optimization can usually be 
carried out with much reduced execution time. For example, Tsai et al. [1] used cluster computing 
to implement an efficient global optimization method, Dividing Rectangles algorithm, to reduce 
the computing load in a thermohydrodynamic (THD) lubrication analysis. Design of experiments 
  3
dual-hidden-layer back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) were tested. The Neural Network 
Toolbox of MATLAB was used to perform the calculation from the selected BPNN learning 
algorithms. In a training process the weights are adjusted to minimize the error between the 
output and the current prediction. The total number of the unknowns is determined by the number 
of the total weights, the number of the inputs, the number of neurons in hidden layer(s), and the 
number of the outputs. In this study of the ANN models of two inputs and one output the number 
of unknowns of a fully connected dual-hidden-layer BPNN with N neurons in each layer is 
N2+5N+1. Table 1 lists the number of unknowns to be determined for the both single- and 
dual-hidden-layer BPNNs. 
In this study the hidden layers of the networks are the composed neurons with a hyperbolic 
tangent sigmoid activation function and the activation function of the output layer is a linear 
function. This architecture has been shown to provide outstanding performance in various 
situations [10]. To test the effectiveness of training algorithms on various BPNNs three popular 
algorithms, gradient descent (GD), gradient descent with momentum (GDM), and 
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, were examined.  
 
3. Thermohydrodynamic lubrication model 
The mathematical models for evaluating the performance of a fluid-film lubricated slider 
bearing in the THD regime can be presented by two coupled differential equations, a simplified 
generalized Reynolds equation (Eq. (1)) and a transient 3-D energy equation (Eq. (2)). In this 
study the Reynolds equation was solved iteratively using a successive over relaxation method and 
the numerical scheme used for the time dependent energy equation was the alternating direction 
implicit method [11]. The governing equations are:

In Eqs. (1) and (2) p is fluid-film pressure; x, y, and z are the coordinates in sliding direction, 
the direction perpendicular to sliding direction, and the across film direction, respectively; U is 
bearing velocity; F1, F2, and F3 are the factors affecting film pressure due to the viscosity 
gradient in z-direction; T is lubricant temperature; μ , ρ , c, and k are viscosity, density, specific 
heat, and conductivity of the lubricant, respectively; u, v, and w are the lubricant velocity 
components in the x-, y-, and z-direction, respectively. The boundary pressure for the fluid film of 
the slider is equal to the ambient pressure. The thermal boundary in the stationary surface of the 
bearing is treated adiabatically and the moving surface is considered isothermally.  
The film pressure is affected by the aspect ratio (length to the width of the slider) of a given 
projected area and the normalized slider slope. The fixed-incline slider has an inlet film thickness 
  5
2-9-1, and 2-3-3-1 versus 2-6-1). Therefore, it can be noted that the prediction result of a BPNN 
depends not only on the architecture (number of neurons and number of hidden layers) but also 
on the sample size for network training.  
The main effort to construct the neural network metamodel came largely from the network 
training. In this study the execution of the network training was performed in a PC with 1.7 GHz 
CPU. When considering the prediction accuracy (Figs. 4 and 5) and training time (Fig. 6) of the 
various networks, a BPNN of 2-4-4-1 configuration was selected for further analysis of sample 
size effect. It can be seen that a large sample size (equals or exceeds eight levels per variable) can 
produce a BPNN which gives very accurate prediction of the THD lubrication solutions (Fig. 7).  
To further validate the selected 2-4-4-1 BPNN which was trained by using a sample of 100 
data points, a randomly sample of 1,000 points were generated. The resultant RMSE of validation 
points is 6.8e-4 MPa, which demonstrates the accuracy of the metamodel. The 50 largest 
deviation points are plotted in Fig. 8, which are in good agreement with the numerical solutions. 
It is verified that the proposed BPNN can be used to replace the THD lubrication model in many 
applications, such as in an optimization procedure to accelerate the process.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study presents an assessment of a neural network based metamodel for tribological 
studies. A slider bearing modeled in the THD regime with two design variables was used for 
verifying the applicability of the proposed metamodel. The purpose was to address the issue that 
the applicability of a metamodel for rapid computation with accurate prediction. It can be seen 
that the training algorithm, the configuration of the BPNN, and the sample size have considerable 
effect on the training loading and prediction accuracy. This study can facilitate similar 
applications in the field of computational Tribology in which metamodels may be useful in 
replacing computationally intensive numerical models.  
The LM algorithm used in BPNN training is a modification of Gauss-Newton method. In 
many cases the solution (parameters tuning) converges quickly by using LM algorithm for 
multilayer feed-forward neural network. However, in some cases LM algorithm may cause the 
weights to converge locally due to poorly “selected” initial weights, resulted in a poor model (e.g., 
2-8-8-1 model in Fig. 6). The abonrmal result usually comes with a fast convergence. In that case 
another set of initial weights may be required to test or a hybrid learning strategy which modifies 
the LM algorithm may be useful [12]. A developed neural work can also be tuned with new 
information to fortify the model accuracy or the range of usability. 
The steadily growing complexity of tribological models demands more computational power 
than usual. Even with the help of parallel computing of some form, a real-time response of such 
simulation is very difficult to achieve. As demonstrated in this study the proposed neural network 
based metamodel capable of instant response with high solution accuracy may be helpful in 
realizing the characteristics of a complex tribological system directly.
