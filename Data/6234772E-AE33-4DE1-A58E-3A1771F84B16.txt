base pressure of the chamber was maintained at a 
vacuum less than 5×10−7 torr. The resulting compositions 
of the three ZrCuTiTa TFMGs in this study are 
Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13, Zr31Cu15Ti10Ta44, and Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74, 
the same used in our previous report [7]. The thicknesses 
of all as-deposited ZrCuTiTa TFMGs lie within 2-3 μm.  
The micropillar specimens were prepared via the 
dual-beam focus ion beam (FIB) system (Seiko, 
SMI3050 SE). The Ga ion beam is operated at 30 kV and 
7-12 nA, in order to reduce the Ga ion damage. Based on 
our previous experience [17], the Ga damage layer is 
limited within 3-4 nm. The micropillar diameter and 
height are ~1 and ~2 μm, respectively. The 
micro-compression tests were performed using the MTS 
Nanoindenter XP system (Agilent Technologies) with a 
flat-end Berkovich tip. The resolution of displacement 
and load is 0.01 nm and 50 nN, respectively. The shape is 
equilateral triangle with the 13.5 m in each side. The 
test mode is the loading rate control. For Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13 
and Zr31Cu15Ti10Ta44, the peak load was set at 2 mN; and 
for Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74, the peak load was set at 3 mN. The 
loading rates are all 0.0167 mNs-1 for the three TFMGs. 
At the peak load, the load was held for 60 seconds. The 
corresponding strain rate is in the range of 10-4 s-1. Thus, 
the load is unloaded at the same loading rate.  
In order to extract the strain rate sensitivity, m, for 
analysis, nanoindentation testing was also conducted at 
room temperature using the MTS XP nanoindenter with 
the typical Berkovich tip. Using the loading rate control 
mode, the peak load and the loading rate were set to be 5 
mN and 1 mNs-1, respectively. The holding time is 30 
seconds for the calculation of strain rate sensitivity. For 
accuracy, each extracted strain rate sensitivity datum is 
an average from at least 9 tests.  
 
3.  Results and discussion 
3.1  Microcompression 
 During compression testing under the loading rate 
control mode, the strain rate ( p ) over the elastic region 
can be calculated by using the following simple equation,  
dt
dh
hp
p
1
,
                          (1) 
where hp is the micropillar height, h is t are the 
micropillar displacement and loading time, respectively. 
For the Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13, Zr31Cu15Ti10Ta44, and 
Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 micropillars, the strain rates are all in the 
static state 10-4 range. All of them are under the 
quasi-state deformation. The engineering stress-strain 
curves of the three TFMG micropillars, shown in Fig. 1, 
indicate the yield strength of Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13, 
Zr31Cu15Ti10Ta44, and Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 are about 2.1, 2.2, 
and 3.3 GPa, respectively. Compared with our previous 
hardness data, shown in Table 1 [7], the trends for yield 
strength and hardness are the same.  
It is noted that the stress-strain curve of the plastic 
deformation in the Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 micropillar behaves 
differently from those of the Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13 and 
Zr31Cu15Ti10Ta44 ones. It can be seen that the events of 
strain burst in Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 are vaguer than those of 
other specimens. Figures 2(a) to 2(c) exhibit the traces of 
shear bands which pass through all micropillars, 
indicating that the shear banding mechanism still 
dominates the plastic deformation even in the amorphous 
Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 micropillars.  
The stress-strain curves can be transferred to the 
strain rate-time curves. Figure 3(a) for the Zr-rich 
Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13 micropillar shows the typical strain 
bursts originated from shear band propagation. The strain 
bursts are located at the stress levels of ~2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.7, 
and 3.0 GPa, respectively. The typical recorded strain 
rates for the strain bursts are about 10-2-10-1 s-1 for the 
Zr-rich Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13 pillars. But limited by the 
instrument resolution, the measured strain burst rates 
should be lower than the actual strain burst rates 
(possibly higher than 103 s-1) [18]. The shear band 
propagation in this Zr-rich micropillar is discontinuous 
and rapid. Contrary to the rapid events, Fig. 3(b) for the 
Ta-rich Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 micropillar exhibits vaguer strain 
bursts. The continuous-like plastic deformation is 
actually attributed to many tiny strain bursts which are 
located at ~3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.9, 4.4, 4.7, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, and 
5.8 GPa, respectively. This result suggests that more 
multiple shear bands occur in the Ta-rich micropillars. 
The recorded strain rates for the strain bursts are about 
5x10-3 s-1 for the Ta-rich Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 pillars, much 
lower than those for the Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13 ones.  
Here, we intent to discuss from two aspects. The 
first is related to the initiation of shear bands, and the 
second is the microstructure influenced by the 
introduction of Ta.  
 
3.2  Initiation of shear bands 
For the initiation of shear bands, according to 
Argon [19], the process of shear band operation at low 
temperatures is a stress-assisted nucleation event. The 
shear strain rate ( ) of the shear bands can be expressed 
by the simple constitutive equation, as shown below 
)exp(
kT
Gs
s
   ,                  (2) 
where s  and Gs are the characteristic shear strain 
rate of shear bands and free enthalpy to initiate shear 
deformation. Schuh et al. [19] have derived the 
simplified form of Gs as 
2)1(
s
ssss ΩCG 
  ,               (3) 
where Cs is equal to 4.6 by simplification of Schuh et al. 
[20], s the activation volume of amorphous alloys,  
and s the loading shear stress and the critical shear stress 
to initiate the shear bands. With increasing applied shear 
stress, Gs tends to decrease continuously, implying that 
the shear band can be initiated easily at a greater stress 
level. The two pre-exponential factors, s ands, would 
determine the magnitude ofGs. Here, we need to 
extract the right s ands values for the Zr45Cu27Ti15Ta13, 
Zr31Cu15Ti10Ta44, and Zr14Cu7Ti5Ta74 TFMGs. For the 
activation volume,s, Pan et al. [21] demonstrate the 
following equation based on the cooperative shearing 
model (CSM) of shear transition zones (STZs): 
 6
dramatically exhaust the kinetic energy, slowing down 
the propagation.  
Based on the above observations and analyses, the 
relationship between the presence of abundant 
nanoclusters and the slower shear band propagation (as 
well as the limited distance of strain bursts) is 
demonstrated. With this concept, we can control the 
phenomena of shear band propagation by incorporating a 
needed volume fraction of nanoclusters.  
  
4.  Conclusions 
In this study, we use the microcompression and 
nanoindentation tests to characterize the mechanical 
behavior of the ZrCuTiTa amorphous micropillars with 
different levels of Ta content. With increasing Ta, the 
modulus, hardness, strength, strain rate sensitivity, and 
viscosity all increase, while the extracted activation 
volume s and the enthalpy to initiate shear deformation 
Gs decrease.  
The Ta-rich amorphous micropillars show vaguer 
strain burst events and continuous-like plastic 
deformation, with multiple and numerous minor 
shear-banding events, as a result of lower enthalpy to 
initiate shear deformation Gs. Also, in the Ta-rich 
amorphous micropillars, the much higher viscosity is 
attributed to the higher density of nanoclusters. The 
friction among shear band and nanoclusters would 
exhaust the kinetic energy. The drag force from 
nanoclusters would induce a slower shear band 
propagation rate. 
The finding and concept reached in this study 
might be applied for the control of shear band 
propagation by incorporating a needed volume fraction 
of nanoclusters.

ZrCu pillar samples fabricated by FIB. We use TEM 
instead of SEM with a hope to detect shear band 
formation inside the test sample, which cannot be 
observed by SEM. We also carried out, in parallel, 
finite-element simulations of the compressive 
deformation and compared with the experimental 
observations. 
Experimental samples with composition of Zr50Cu50 
were deposited on Si (100) wafers by magnetron 
co-sputtering method using the parameters developed by 
Dudonis [20]. The total amorphous film thickness was 
fixed at ~1500 nm. The nature of as-deposited thin films 
was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens), 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JOEL 
3010). To further explore the microscale mechanical 
properties of as-deposited thin films, nanopillars were 
prepared from the resultant films using the dual focus ion 
beam system (FIB, Seiko SMI3050 SE). In-situ TEM 
compression tests are conducted by a novel and recently 
developed Hysitron picoindenter TEM holder (Hysitron 
Inc., Minneapolis, MN) on a JEOL 2010F TEM, 
equipped with a diamond flat punch 1.5 m diameter. 　
The nanocompression is also performed in the 
displacement-control mode and the corresponding strain 
rate is 5 x 10-3 s-1. 
Nanopillar samples with a length of ~1.5 µm were 
fabricated by FIB.  These nanopillars have a 140 
nm-diameter top and ~250 nm-diameter bottom. The 
aspect ratio is over 6, which is higher than the aspect 
ratio of 2-5 conventionally used for compression 
specimens. The high aspect ratio was used in order to 
minimize possibly accidental collision between the 
indenter tip and sample base.  
Several predetermined displacements, 100, 200 and 
300 nm, were initially selected for the in-situ 
compression of ZrCu nanopillars. After several trials, it 
was found that only displacement that is larger than 200 
nm produces sufficiently useful results. Subsequently, 
most examinations were conducted on samples 
compressed to a displacement of 300 nm. The 
load-displacement (similar to engineering stress-strain) 
curves from several samples are summarized in Fig. 1. 
There are some data variations, probably caused by the 
initial misalignment of samples, the shape and trend of 
these curves are similar. The yield strength varies 
between 1.8 and 2.5 GPa, which are within the range 
reported in the literature [3-11, 21]. 
The compressive load typically reaches its 
maximum level at a displacement of about 75 nm, 
followed by a gradual decrease. This load decrease is 
resulted from severe buckling or bending as will be 
shown below from the in situ TEM observations. The 
buckling phenomenon is inevitable due to a sample high 
aspect ratio (~6) and, possibly, sample bending due to 
misalignment. In fact, it has been pointed out by Zhang 
et al. [22] that buckling is significant when the aspect 
ratio of the test pillar is greater than 5. Therefore, for the 
current ZrCu nanopillars, the reasonable maximum 
compressive strength without significant buckling or 
bending should be the upper-bound value of about 
2.0-2.5 GPa.  
To view in situ deformation, a series of cropped 
TEM video frames recording the deformation of ZrCu 
nanopillar are shown in sequence in Figs. 2(a)-(h), 
together with the corresponding load-displacement curve 
(inset). The bottom part of the sample (gray area) is the 
silicon substrate. The pillar is tapered (~3). To perfectly 
align nm-sized compressive sample is extremely 
challenging and almost impossible. As shown in Fig. 2, 
the sample axis is slightly off the compressive axis 
(~2-3). To simplify the analysis, we neglect the effect of 
misalignment in the current paper. 
Plastic deformation in the sample is noted to be 
local, occurs mainly in the upper portion of the sample. 
The change in cross-sectional area as a function of 
distance from the top of the pillar sample after being 
deformed 300 nm is shown in Fig. 3(a). Apparently, the 
dimension of the bottom part of the sample remains 
practically unchanged even after being compressed to a 
300 nm displacement. It is primarily because metallic 
glasses are perfectly plastic material and the test sample 
is tapered. The strain localization near the top of the 
sample was additionally supported by the observation 
that the initial TEM contrast of the top part of the sample 
was brighter, resulting from a smaller diameter because 
tapering. After compression, the top part of the pillar 
gradually became darker as a result of increasing 
diameter. It is particularly noted in Fig. 2 that, despite the 
strain localization near the top of the sample, there is no 
visible evidence of localized shear across the sample and 
the deformed sample has a mushroom top, just like that 
observed by Volkert et al. [6].  According to the 
conventional wisdom, one would seemingly draw a 
conclusion that the pillar was homogeneously deformed. 
This is, in fact, not the case. As demonstrated later in the 
simulation, shear bands do initiate from the contact 
corner between the sample and punch and form inverse 
cone with the tip of the cone located along the centerline 
of the compressive axis. 
Whereas SEM micrograph can offer 3-dimension 
morphology of a deformed pillar and the presence of 
surface offset caused by shear banding, TEM only 
provides a 2-dimension view. It is, therefore, hard to 
detect the sudden formation of individual shear band 
from the current TEM images. The difficulty is caused 
by the fact that not only because the width of a shear 
band is extra thin (~10-20 nm), requiring the use of a 
high-resolution TEM for observation [23], but also 
because shear band propagation speed is extremely rapid 
(~4 mm/s) [24]. It is estimated to take less than 0.1 ms to 
propagate a shear band through the entire pillar sample. 
However, the current TEM video speed is only 13 
frame/s, thus lack of temporal resolution to capture shear 
bands. Also, the pillar specimen is failed after 
deformation, and cannot be examined by lattice imaging 
for searching the possible existence of shear bands.  
To investigate the tapering effects on the shear 
band formation and deformation behavior, finite element 
simulations were performed using the free volume model 
[25]. In this model, the plastic shear strain rate p  is 
given by the flow equation,

(3) Mechanical characteristics of 
Mg-Cu-Zr thin film metallic glasses 
 
S. Y. Kuan, H. S. Chou, J. C. Huang* 
 
Abstract  For improving the ductility of metallic 
glasses, nanocrystals within the amorphous matrix are 
frequently intentionally added. In this study, the MgCuZr 
thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) with a positive 
mixing heat between Mg and Zr are fabricated via 
co-sputtering in an attempt to separate the pure Mg 
nano-particles. The microstructure and mechanical 
properties of the sputtered MgCuZr thin films and their 
FIB-machined micropillars are examined as a function of 
Mg content from 39 to 100 at%. From the 
nanoindentation and micropillar load-displacement 
curves, the Mg-rich metallic glass composites exhibit 
smoother nature and more ductile behavior. Meanwhile, 
due to strong (0002) basal texture, the Mg-rich thin films 
 12
content is high. However, this did not happen. This is 
because that, with the highly negative heat of mixing 
between Zr and Cu, these two atoms would attract each 
other strongly, forming tight Zr-Cu bonds and difficult to 
be separated. The strong attractive force between Zr and 
Cu suppress the Zr precipitation in the Mg matrix when 
the Mg content is high. 
 Figure 2(a) shows the nanoindentation 
load-displacement curves, which can be divided into two 
groups. The first group for Mg39 to Mg55 possesses the 
pop-in events with increasing applied load, typical for 
metallic glasses or metallic glass composites under 
nanoindentation; and the second one for Mg 73 to pure 
Mg shows smooth curves, typical for ductile crystalline 
metals. Pop-in events are the discontinuous strain caused 
by the shear band propagations within the metallic 
glasses. As the Mg particles are precipitated, the shear 
band propagations would be interacted and suppressed 
by the Mg particles in the first group. For the other group, 
crystalline Mg becomes the matrix and the deformation 
mechanism now is changed to dislocation activity, not 
shear banding. As a result, the load-displacement curve 
becomes smooth. The elastic modulus (E) and hardness 
(H) of the MgCuZr alloy thin films, measured by 
nanoindentation, are shown in Fig. 2(b). It is obvious that 
the modulus decreases from ~90 to ~70 GPa, and 
hardness from ~5.5 to ~1.5 GPa, with increasing Mg 
content. We can find that the trend of elastic modulus is 
slightly irregular, presumably resulting from the 
complicated influence of bonding length between Mg 
and Zr/Cu [15, 19]. For Mg73 to Mg84, the hardness 
remains around 3.2 GPa. Basu et al. [20] also found that 
the modulus would rise with a high volume fraction of 
crystalline phase in partially crystalline La-based bulk 
metallic glass system. It appears that the modulus has 
been affected via the interaction and formation of rigid 
networks of crystalline phases. This is a tremendous 
improvement, compared with the hardness of about 
0.4-0.8 GPa for commercial Mg alloys possessing grain 
sizes ~100 m [21], or with the hardness of 2 GPa for 
nanocrystalline Mg alloys [22]. 
Microcompression testing was utilized for 
extracting the uniaxial compression mechanical 
characteristics. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the metallic-glass 
or metallic-glass composite MgCuZr thin films, i.e., 
Mg39 to Mg73, exhibit the characteristics of strain bursts. 
The first apparent strain burst is usually defined as the 
yield stress. In comparison, some gradual transformation 
from elastic to plastic deformation can be found in Mg78, 
Mg84 and pure Mg. Figure 3(b) shows the variation 
trend of the yield stress with increasing Mg content. Note 
that even for Mg78 and Mg84, with predominant Mg 
crystalline phase retained, the yield stress can still 
maintain around 1.5 GPa, significantly greater than the 
yield stress for pure Mg or commercial Mg alloys 
(around 0.1 to 0.4 GPa).  
 Figure 4 shows the deformed Mg39, Mg73, Mg84 
and pure Mg micropillars. For the Mg39 micropillar in 
Fig. 4(a) and the Mg73 micropillar in Fig. 4(b), the 
deformation characteristics are still dominated by shear 
band propagation, but the higher Mg-containing metallic 
glass composites typically show more ductile multiple 
shear banding. For Mg84 in Fig. 4(c) and pure Mg in Fig. 
4(d), the deformation appears to be gradually governed 
by the deformation instability of nanocrystalline Mg. 
When the volume fraction of Mg particles increases, the 
structures of MgCuZr thin films with high Mg contents 
become a crystalline matrix with dispersed metallic 
glassy phases. As a result, the propensity of shear band 
propagation, or the strain discontinuity, is reduced with 
increasing Mg content. 
 TEM characterization was conducted on the 
MgCuZr thin films with various Mg contents. Figures 5 
present the bright and dark field images, with the 
inserted diffraction pattern, showing the separated 
nanocrystalline Mg HCP phase, with a mean particle size 
of ~50 nm. In the Mg39 to Mg55 films, the 
microstructure contains an amorphous matrix with minor 
nanocrystalline Mg particles. With increasing Mg content 
in the Mg73, Mg78 and Mg84 films, the microstructure 
becomes the dominant HCP Mg matrix (of an average 
grain size in the neighborhood of 100 nm) with minor 
amorphous domains. These Mg grains are predominantly 
oriented with their (0002) basal planes lying on the thin 
film plane, meaning the Mg grains are highly textured, 
consistent with the XRD patterns.  
Note that the hardness readings of the MgCuZr 
thin films shown in Fig. 2(b) are seen to decreases 
appreciably with increasing Mg content. However, the 
yield stress data shown in Fig. 3(b) do not show the 
similar trend. Mg73, Mg78, and Mg84 can still maintain 
a high compressive yield stress ~1.5 GPa, not much 
different from the ~1.7 GPa for the Mg39 thin film. We 
believe that the difference is caused mainly by the strong 
(0002) basal plane texture. When the Mg73, Mg78, and 
Mg84 micropillars, containing abundant (0002) grains 
with the c-axis parallel to the pillar axis as well as the 
loading direction, are subjected to compression, the most 
easy slip planes (0002) are not active in the beginning. 
The micropillars will sustain until higher applied stress 
levels to activate the pyramidal slip planes. Thus, such 
Mg73, Mg78, and Mg84 micropillars can still show high 
yield stresses around 1.5 GPa. Other than the texture 
effect, the mismatch of elastic modulus [23] and size 
effect of crystalline materials [24] could also offer some 
strengthening contributions.  
In contrast, when the Mg73, Mg78 and Mg84 thin 
films are subjected to nanoindentation, the complex 3D 
stress states can activate the non-basal slip planes from 
the beginning. Thus the Mg73, Mg78, Mg84 films will 
exhibit much lower hardness. Also, under 
nanoindentation loading, there exists a plastic 
hemispherical zone surrounding the hydrostatic zone, 
and the semi-circular shear bands would propagate along 
the plastic zone. Furthermore, Chen and Lin [25] and 
Kuan et al. [26] reported that there are two kinds of shear 
bands under nanoindentation, namely, the radial shear 
bands which nucleate and propagate along the maximum 
shear stress plane, and the semi-circular shear bands 
which corresponding circular centers at the intersections 
of sample surface. Because of the texture effect, the 
deformation of the semi-circular or radial shearing would 
be different from those occurring under 
microcompression. Patnaik et al. [26] showed that

Abstract  The microstructure and tensile response of 
amorphous ZrCu and nanocrystalline Cu multilayered 
thin films, with sharp or graded interfaces, are examined 
and analyzed. The extracted tensile properties of the 
multilayered films can be compared with the predicted 
values based on the iso-strain Rule of Mixture model. 
The multilayered films with graded interfaces, each 
about 50 nm thick, consistently exhibit higher tensile 
strength and elongation. This can be rationalized by the 
reduced stress and strain incompatibility along the 
interfaces.

1.  Introduction 
Metallic glasses (MGs) have been developed and 
have attracted attention over the past few decades [1-4] 
due to their unique mechanical and physical properties, 
for instance, high strength and hardness, good corrosion 
resistance, excellent shaping and forming ability in the 
viscosity state, and so on. Recently, the dimension of 
MGs can be successfully reduced from bulk to thin film 
scales by using the sputtering technique [5]. The nano- 
and micro-scaled thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) can 
retain the inherent properties and be utilized as potential 
materials in the Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems 
(MEMS) devices [6-7].  
However, high strength and good ductility are 
difficult to coexist in monolithic MGs, especially under 
tensile testing at room temperature [8]. To solve this 
problem, the major improvement utilized in BMGs is to 
incorporate some ductile metallic phases in the 
amorphous matrix as BMG composites (BMGCs) [9-12]. 
For TFMGs, the toughening concept has been developed 
by integrating the amorphous and more ductile metallic 
layers as multilayered thin films (MLTFs) [13-18].  
Nieh et al. [13] and Wang et al. [14] found that 
amorphous/nanocrystalline Cu4Zr3/Cu and CuZr/Cu 
MLTFs with nano-scaled layer thickness could possess 
both high tensile strength and good ductility. Donhue et 
al. [15] indicated that the shear bands could be arrested 
by the crystalline layer and the dislocations could be 
annihilated by the amorphous layer. In addition, ductile 
CuZr/Cu MLTFs with various combinations of layer 
thickness (10-250 nm) were investigated by Pei et al. 
[16], Lee et al. [17], and Huang et al. [18]. Recently, Kim 
et al. [19] systematically examined the tensile 
deformation of free-standing CuZr/Cu nano-scaled 
specimens with a very small gage length of 700 nm, 
prepared by complicated fabrication of dry etching and 
focused ion beam (FIB) machining. These nano-scaled 
specimens exhibited high tensile strength of 2.5 GPa and 
~4% strain, approaching the intrinsic theoretical 
properties of CuZr/Cu.   
Although the tensile properties of TFMGs could be 
improved by the multilayered structure, the stress 
concentration, interface debonding, or interface sliding, 
etc, could induce unsatisfactory premature failure along 
the interfaces. The sharp interfaces between the 
connected amorphous and nanocrystalline layers might 
 16
Cu particles were not dispersed uniformly in the graded 
interfacial layer, being more near the Cu layer and less 
near the ZrCu layer. For the electron diffraction pattern 
in Fig. 2(b), the halo is referred to the amorphous ZrCu 
structure and the rings and spots are corresponded to the 
d-spacings of Cu {111}, {311} and {222} planes. 
Furthermore, Fig. 2(b) shows the high resolution TEM 
lattice image taken from one interface in G8L, showing 
some nanocrystalline pure Cu particles with the size of 
3-5 nm in the amorphous ZrCu matrix.  
The mechanical properties of Cu-supported 
ZrCu/Cu MLTFs with graded and sharp interfaces were 
tested under tension at room temperature. According to 
the equations reported by Macionczyk and Bruckner [27], 
the tensile load of MLTFs can be extracted by 
subtracting the load contribution of uncoated Cu foil. 
Then, the tensile stress of MLTFs, film,can be calculated 
by dividing the cross-sectional area of MLTFs in gauge 
section: 
 
),)](/(1[ substratetotalfilmfilmfilm FFtw                  
where wfilm and tfilm are the width and thickness of 
MLTFs, and Ftotal, and Fsubstrate are the tensile loads of the 
coated specimen and uncoated Cu foil, respectively. The 
base tensile result of the uncoated Cu foil as the standard 
reference was tested for numerous times to ensure 
reliability. In addition, each condition of the coated 
specimens was tested for at least three times for datum 
duplication. For the graded specimens, the representative 
tensile load versus strain curves for the uncoated and 
coated Cu foils are plotted in Fig. 3(a). The load 
contributed by MLTFs can be extracted by the difference 
of these two curves. With the contribution of ZrCu/Cu 
MLTFs with graded interfaces, the tensile loads of coated 
specimens are obviously higher than those of uncoated 
Cu foils.  
The tensile stresses of graded specimens can be 
easily calculated by Eq. (1), and the stress-strain curves 
are plotted in Fig. 3(b). The average tensile strength of 
G2L, G6L and G8L MLTFs reached 665±93, 800±56, 
and 850±54 MPa, respectively. Also, the average 
engineering strains of G2L, G6L and G8L are 
1.5%±0.1%, 2.1%±0.2%, and 2.3%±0.1%, respectively. 
All the tensile results are listed in Table 1. The tensile 
stress and strain of the coated specimens both increased 
with increasing layer period from 2L to 8L. It appears 
that, with more graded layers (or graded volumes), the 
resulting tensile strength and elongation of multilayered 
thin film would be improved.  
 The above experimental data on the multilayered 
film, film, can be compared with the prediction based on 
the iso-strain Rule of Mixture (ROM) model:  
 
,film CuCuZrCuZrCu VV                                       
where VZrCu and VCu are the volume fractions of the ZrCu 
and Cu layers, and ZrCu and Cu are stresses for ZrCu 
and Cu. However, the strength level for the ZrCu thin 
flim is rather widely scattered in literature. The 
compressive strength for ZrCu lies around 1500 to 2000 
MPa [28-31], and the compressive elastic strain is 
usually ~2%. However, under tension, the monolithic 
ZrCu films could never sustain up to 2%. Thus the 
reliable tensile strength could be lowered to around 
800-1400 MPa [13,19,32,33]. It is considered that 1100 
MPa is a logical range. As for the nanocrystalline Cu 
layers with a layer thickness of 100-500 nm and an 
average grain size about 30-50 nm, the reported values 
for tensile yield stress lie within 150-300 MPa [25,34], 
depending on the Hall-Petch effect and work hardening 
condition. The middle range of 220 MPa should be in the 
reasonable regime. According to Eq. (2), with the volume 
fraction of each phase, Vf, of 50 vol%, the calculated 
strength of the multilayered film is 660 MPa. This can be 
readily compared with the results for the sharp interfaces 
(556 and 669 MPa) in Table 1.  
 As for the graded interfaces, there are interfacial 
layers (regions), 55±10 nm thick, with fine Cu particles 
(about 5-10 nm in size) dispersed in the ZrCu amorphous 
matrix. There is no dispersion hardening theory for 
metallic glass matrix, such as the Orowan strengthening 
theory derived for crystalline alloys based on the 
dislocation concept. But from our previous experience in 
metallic glass composites [12,35,36], the MG composite 
strength is usually improved by the dispersed metal 
particles by about 20%. Thus, it is reasonable to estimate 
the strength of this graded interfacial layer to be ~1320 
MPa (1100 MPa × 120%), as also listed in Table 1. Using 
the same concept of Eq. (2) and assuming the ZrCu, Cu, 
and graded layers being about 1/3 in Vf for each, the 
resulting iso-strain ROM model for multilayered films 
with graded interfaces can be reworded as follows:  
,VVVσ CuCuerfaceintgradederfaceintgradedZrCuZrCufilm graded   
 
where the VZrCu, Vgraded-interfaces, and VCu are the volume 
fractions for the amorphous ZrCu layers, graded 
interfaces (or regions), and nanocrystalline Cu layers, 
respectively. In the meanwhile, the ZrCu, graded-interfaces, 
and Cu are the stresses for amorphous ZrCu layers, 
graded interfaces (or regions), and nanocrystalline Cu 
layers, respectively. In Eq. (3), the volume fractions for 
these three regions can be boldly divided into three equal 
parts. Therefore, the resulting iso-strain ROM strength 
for multilayered films with graded interfaces could be 
represented as the combination of 1100/3, 220/3, and 
1320/3 MPa by using this equation. The value of tensile 
strength for the multilayered thin films with graded 
interfaces can be computed to be 880 MPa. This value is 
again comparable to the experimental data of 800-850 
MPa for the G6L and G8L specimens in Table 1.  
 From Figs. 3 and 4, it is apparent that the G6L and 
G8L multilayered films did not fail immediately after the 
yielding of Cu substrate and Cu nanocrystalline layers (at 
about 0.8-1.0% tensile strain). The films can sustain and 
undergo tensile plastic strain up to 2.3%. The tensile 
straining of 2.0-2.5% is a result of co-straining of ZrCu, 
Cu and graded layers. The elastic strain for amorphous 
ZrCu layers is generally considered to be about 2%, and 
the elastic strain for nanocrystalline Cu layers is about 
1%. Since the Cu layers would undergo plastic 
deformation from 1% strain, the overall ZrCu/Cu 
multilayered film would also reveal plastic straining 
from 1%. The plastic straining in Cu layers would force 
the ZrCu layers to proceed plastic straining via multiple 
shear banding. For the G2L film, the thicker ZrCu 
metallic glass layer cannot sustain and would fail

Abstract  Vanadium was alloyed to an amorphous 
Cu-Zr-Al alloy to induce B2-CuZr phase formation to 
improve plasticity.  The V addition was based on the 
fact that it has a positive heat of mixing with the major 
constituents in the Cu-Zr-Al alloy, thus could cause 
liquid phase separation.  Compression tests were 
conducted and it was found that dilute V addition 
induced B2-CuZr formation and, thus, improved 
plasticity of the Cu-Zr-Al alloy.  However, when the V 
content is more than 3 at%, V-rich brittle intermetallic 
compound phase was formed, which caused detrimental 
effects on the mechanical properties. Microstructures of 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)100-xVx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, in at%) 
both before and after compressive deformation were 
examined using transmission electron microscopy.  The 
role of V on plasticity improvement was discussed in the 
frame of shear band multiplication, energy dissipation 
during shear banding, twinning/phase transformation of 
the B2-CuZr particles during deformation, and 
deformation induced B2-CuZr particle coarsening.

Introduction 
Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have attracted large 
attention because their unique properties, such as high 
strength, large elastic limit, good shaping properties in 
viscous state, and reasonable corrosion resistance [1-4].  
However, metallic glasses are also known for being 
extremely brittle, failing in a catastrophic manner, as a 
result of the formation of localized shear bands [5, 6].  
In tension, metallic glasses can be stretched elastically to 
typically about 2% of strain, followed by drastic 
shear-off fracture [6].  In compression, highly localized 
shear along the principal shear plane dominates and the 
materials usually exhibit shear softening and insufficient 
plastic strain [7-9].  Composite approaches, both 
extrinsic [10] and intrinsic [11], have been used to 
subdue the shear band propagation but with limited 
success.  
Recently, it was demonstrated that tensile plasticity 
of BMGs could be enhanced by introducing micron or 
nano-scale into the amorphous matrix [12-21].  For 
example, Pauly et al. [21] showed that the presence of 
B2-CuZr nanoparticles in a Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 alloy could 
apparently improve its tensile plasticity.  The B2-CuZr 
nanoparticles, 2-5 nm in the as-cast condition, were able 
to twin, phase-transform, and coarsen (to 10-50 nm) 
under deformation.  These deformation processes could 
prevent plastic instability and dissipate energy, thereby 
improved the ductility.  Wu et al. [12] also 
demonstrated that a minor 0.5 at% addition of Co in the 
Zr48Cu47.5Al4Co0.5 alloy could further improve the tensile 
ductility, due to much larger B2-CuZr spherical particles 
up to 100 m.  In this Co-containing alloy, the strain 
hardening rate was enhanced and plastic instability was 
suppressed due to a B2-CuZr to B19’-ZrCu martensitic 
 20
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)90V10 samples (Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)) show 
obvious phase contrast, indicative of the presence of 
darker crystalline phases in the brighter glassy matrix.  
Chemical compositions measured by EDS from the two 
phases confirm that there are some chemical differences 
between the two phases, especially in the Cu and V 
content.  The results suggest that, in the liquid state, Cu 
and V might be separated due to a positive heat of 
mixing between them, as indicated by the calculated 
phase diagram in Fig. 1(c).  During cooling from the 
liquid state, the two elements partition separately in the 
solidified phases.  Since both binary Cu-Zr and V-Al 
have a high negative heat of mixing (Table 1), it leads to 
the formation of the Cu-Zr rich (brighter) and V-Al rich 
regions (darker) in the solidified product.  Based on the 
XRD and SEM/EDS results, it is concluded that the dark 
regions in (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)97V3 and (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)90V10 
are mixtures of V and Al23V4 particles with a size of 
about 1-2 m.  The volume fractions of these particles 
are estimated from SEM and TEM and complied in Table 
2.  
Microstructures of samples were also examined 
using bright-field and high-resolution TEM.  In the 
as-cast samples, no phase contrast is discernible in the 
TEM micrographs taken from Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5, but some 
B2-CuZr particles measuring about 3-5 nm in size were 
observed in (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1. After deformation, few 
B2-CuZr phases with crystalline lattice fringes (4–6 nm 
in size) become apparent in Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 at high 
magnifications, as shown in Fig. 4(a). More B2 
precipitates were seen in the deformed 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 specimens, measuring slightly larger 
to 8-11 nm (Fig. 4(b). Note that such B2 particles are 
much finer than those observed previously [12,21]. The 
volume fractions of the fine B2 phase were also 
measured using Eqn. (1), and the data are included in 
Table 2.  
 
Compressive properties 
Uniaxial compression tests were conducted on the 
as-cast (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)100-xVx (x = 0, 1, 3, 5 and 10) 
samples at room temperature.  Representative 
engineering stress-strain curves for these samples are 
shown in Fig. 5 and the mechanical properties are 
summarized in Table 3.  For easy observation, each 
stress-strain curve is shifted relatively to the right by 
0.01 strain.  Only Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 alloys exhibit notable compressive 
plasticity and, specifically, the fracture strains are 4.7 and 
9.4%, respectively.  Both alloys have the yield strength 
of about 1.85 GPa.  In contrast, (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)95V5 
and (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)90V10 samples fail catastrophically 
even before yielding, exhibit no plasticity.  The 
compressive fracture strengths are 1.31 and 1.07 GPa for 
the 5 at% and 10 at% V-containing alloys, respectively.  
The intermediate alloy, (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)97V3, fails also in 
the elastic region but still can reach a full yield strength 
of 1.85 GPa.  It is apparent that, when V content is over 
about 1 at%, brittle V-rich intermetallic compound 
phases (V+Al23V4) begin to form and, subsequently, 
cause a detrimental effect on plasticity.   
The plastic region in the stress-strain curves of 
Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 is serrated, 
similar to other metallic glasses exhibiting compressive 
strain, and each serration corresponds to the propagation 
of one shear band [8, 26].  The total numbers of 
serration to failure are counted to be 113 and 259 for 
Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1, who fracture at 
4.7 and 9.4%, respectively.  There is no obvious 
difference in the number of shear bands per unit strain 
(~35 shear bands per 1% strain) in these two samples.  
Special effort was also made to estimate the amplitude of 
stress serrations in Fig. 5.  The serration amplitude was 
0.0126 GPa in Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and only slightly higher 
(0.0159 GPa) in (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1; the average stress 
serrations are also similar.  It is pointed out that the first 
discernible strain burst (marked on the curves in Fig. 5) 
is associated with shear band formation.  It occurs at 
1.47 GPa in Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and at a slightly lower value 
of 1.35 GPa in (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1.  These stresses 
correspond to 0.78 and 0.73y, where y is the 
“macroscopic” yield strength of the alloy, i.e. the stress 
plateau in the plastic region.  The ratios are in good 
agreement with that reported in other BMG alloys (~ 
0.79y) [27-29]. 
 
Discussion 
The data presented so far indicate that the addition 
of 1 at% V to Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 improves the compressive 
plasticity but higher V addition degrades the plasticity.  
The fact that the serration density, i.e. shear band 
numbers per unit strain, is essentially the same in both 
Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 and (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 (Fig. 5) suggests 
that the observed plasticity enhancement in 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 is not a result of shear-band 
multiplication, as often reported in BMGs with improved 
plasticity [30].  The amplitude of stress serration is 
associated with energy dissipation during shear band 
propagation.  Our data indicate that the serration 
amplitude in the two alloys is comparable (0.0126 GPa 
vs 0.0159 GPa) suggesting that the energy dissipated 
during shear band propagation in the two alloys is also 
similar.  In other words, the presence of V appears to 
have insignificant effect on the energy dissipation during 
plastic deformation.   
Strain burst on a stress-strain curve is associated 
with shear band formation [26].  The first discernible 
burst is considered the very onset of yielding and is 
affected by the initial free volume content in a BMG 
alloy [31, 32].  The result that (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 has 
a lower strength (1.35 GPa) than that of Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 
(1.47 GPa) suggests that the 1 at% V addition might have 
higher free volume content.  However, according to 
Spaepen’s constitutive equation and related deviation 
[33], the yield strength was found to be extremely 
sensitive to the free volume content. It follows that such 
a small change in strength is unlikely to be caused by an 
appreciable change in free volume.  Thus, the observed 
improved plasticity is unlikely resulted from significant 
increase in free volume caused by the V addition, either.   
As mentioned before, the addition of V to the 
Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 alloy could cause the melt to separate into 
the Cu-rich and V-rich regions during casting because a

In the equation, (Gp - Gm) is essentially the crystallization 
energy, which is estimated to be 2.21*109 J/m3 from 
previous DSC measurements [34, 35].  Substitute data 
from the current measurements, we obtain  pm = 0.293 
J/m2 as the particle-matrix interface energy in the 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 sample.  To our best knowledge, 
there is no experimental datum for the crystallized 
particle-amorphous matrix interface energy in any 
metallic glass system, although it was expected to be low 
[36].  The only available datum is for silicon, which is 
about 0.4 J/m2 [37].  In comparison, the 
crystalline-crystalline interface energy, for example, the 
’ precipitate-aluminum interface is about 1.5 J/m2 [38].  
The current estimation of  pm  for B2-CuZr appears to 
be in the right range.   
Since the interface energy is directly related to the 
coarsening, within the classical coarsening theory [39], 
the above reasonable extracted interface energy implies 
that the coarsening argument is logical.  From the 
energy point of view, our current results appear to 
indirectly support the idea of Pauley et al. [21], i.e. 
plasticity improvement in (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 is 
attributable to the dynamic coarsening of B2-CuZr 
particles, when the B2 particles are too small to induce 
twinning or martensitic transformation.  The fine B2 
particles in the current alloys appear to be unstable, and 
would undergo coarsening during deformation.  It is 
expected that once the B2 particles grow larger to a level 
of a few tens of nanometers, twinning or martensitic 
transformation might be induced.  
 
Conclusions 
A series of (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)100-xVx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 
and 10) (in at%) alloys were synthesized and tested in 
compression.  Microstructural examination showed that 
V was dissolved in the amorphous matrix and promoted 
the formation of B2-CuZr precipitates in 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1.  However, when V content is more 
than 3 at%, brittle intermetallic compound phases 
(V+Al23V4) form and degrade the plasticity.  
Specifically, compressive plasticity in all 
(Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)100-xVx alloys is practically nil, except in 
alloys that with x = 1 or 0.  Plasticity improvement was 
observed only in the (Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5)99V1 alloy and, 
specifically, fracture strain doubles from 4.7 to 9.4 %.  
Shear-band multiplication, energy dissipation by viscous 
flow serration, mechanical twinning and 
deformation-induced phase transformation of B2-CuZr 
particles were excluded as the possible mechanism for 
the current fine B2 particles measuring 3-5 nm.  An 
energy-balance analysis based on deformation-induced 
B2 particle coarsening produced an interfacial energy of 
0.293 J/m2 for the B2 particle-glassy matrix interface.  
This energy value agrees with the available 
amorphous-crystal interface energy in the literature for 
silicon, which is about 0.4 J/m2.  The result appears to 
indirectly support the idea suggested by Pauley et al. [21] 
that plasticity in Cu47.5Zr47.5Al5 is caused by dynamic 
coarsening of the B2-CuZr particles.  It is expected that 
once the B2 particles grow larger to a level of a few tens 
of nanometers, twinning or martensitic transformation 
might be induced.
