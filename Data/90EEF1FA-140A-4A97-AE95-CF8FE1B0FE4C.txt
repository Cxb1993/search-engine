provide dynamic information of cortical electrophysiological changes.   
In this study, we try to collect ERPs data from patients of both tinnitus and hyperacusis 
without significant hearing loss.  Without an audiological pathology in the peripheral hearing, 
it is more informative to record the potential changes of neural activity in the central auditory 
systems.  Our argument is that without significant peripheral hearing loss, tinnitus is more 
prone to be related to the central alterations of functional discordance either in the cortical or 
subcortical levels.  Moreover, previous studies performed on tinnitus with hearing loss often 
showed frequency dependence around the “audiometric edge” in the auditory threshold.  The 
frequency dependence has not been well managed with the comparison between experiment 
and control subjects.  Therefore this study aims to simplify the determination of any 
differences on ERPs measurement of tinnitus complainers.  Furthermore, the differences 
noted with our previous measurements depict more on the static appearance of cortical 
process but less on how the changes proceed with time.  In other words, the amplitude and 
latency of ERPs (N100/P200) provide information on the difference confined to primary 
auditory cortex while how and what interactions between primary auditory cortex and other 
cortical areas are not known.  Regarding the dynamic information computed from original 
ERPs recordings, the IT and CSD of the integrated neural activity recorded from 36 electrodes 
over scalp will contribute to the exploit of interactions among different components of cortex 
related to auditory sensations.  The 2(or3)-dimension simulation of head model for graphic 
manifestations of IT and CSD will further help the comprehensive reading and understanding 
of the underlying mechanisms of tinnitus generation.  With the series of studies toward 
objectification of tinnitus measurements, more and more researchers can work together to 
discover the details of neurophysiological pathogenesis of tinnitus.

Tinnitus/Hyperacusis severity is recorded by a tinnitus/hyperacusis profile questionnaire 
modified from the Emory Clinic Tinnitus & Hyperacusis Center Questionnaire.  All hearing 
tests are carried out in a sound attenuated chamber using a GSI-16 audiometer and TDH-50P 
earphones.  To eliminate possible brain dysfunction due to psychiatric disorders, it is 
required all subjects received detailed psychological evaluation.  In addition, LDLs and 
DPOAEs are recorded before the patients enter the ERP recording process. 
 
Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)： 
Auditory Stimuli The auditory ERPs are evoked by 200msec, computer-generated, pure-tone 
stimuli at 0.5, 1, 2, 4kHz.  The stimuli of each frequency are presented at five different 
intensities (50, 56, 62, 68 and 74 dB SL).   Stimuli are always presented binaurally.  The 
interstimulus intervals are randomized from 1.5 to 2.3 seconds. 
 
Presentation Paradigm We divide the measurements to four sections by its frequency 
parameters (0.5k, 1k, 2k, and 4k).  In each section, 300 stimuli (60 stimuli for each intensity) 
were randomly presented to patients.  A break of 3 minutes or more is given between each 
section. 
 
ERPs Recording Data are recorded from 30 electrodes placed at scalp (according to the 
modified International 10-20 System).  Eye movement artifact, particularly blinks, was 
recorded from vertical and horizontal EOG electrodes.  In order to maintain compatibility 
with previous studies, all electrodes sites were referred to bilateral mastoids.  The ERP 
responses were amplified by a factor of 105 and filtered between 0.1 and 100 Hz using 3dB 
down-filter skirts.  Analog signals are recorded and digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.

Discussions: 
With the varies of our isoelectric topography through four frequencies and five intendities, 
the present results demonstrate no significant difference between normal-hearing tinnitus 
complainers and controls in terms of either frequency- or intensity-dependence of N1 or P2. It 
is noteworthy, though, that in similar studies, the difference of intensity dependence of either 
the N1 or N1-P2 amplitude between tinnitus complainers and normal controls existed at the 
edge frequency of hearing loss. Previous studies proposed that for the distinct pitch of tinnitus, 
the central tinnitus-related activity exists as a response to a decreased auditory input, which is 
due to a peripheral hearing deficit. The above theory is suggested as the underlying 
mechanism of edge frequency (distinct pitch) in tinnitus complainers with hearing loss.  
Kadner et al argued that peripheral hearing loss of tinnitus complainers would cause a 
 91/10/30修訂 
decrease when the stimuli frequencies were lowered. Therefore, potential habituation of the 
fixed order of high to low frequencies of auditory stimuli in this study would not explain very 
well the weaker intensity dependence of tinnitus complainers.  
Also, because of the experiment setting, the intensity of stimulus was higher than that of 
a previous study of intensity dependence of N1 by Kadner et al. Some authors have described 
large inter-individual amplitude differences of late auditory responses, particularly the N1-P2 
component. Accordingly, N1-P2 amplitude increases with stimulus intensity in some 
individuals, while the increase is gradual at low stimulus intensities and at constant or even 
decreasing amplitude at the higher-tested intensities. The above intensity dependence paradox 
may relate to the central mechanisms protecting the cortex against over-stimulation.  
Reviewing the recordings in our study, a few tinnitus subjects demonstrated an 
insignificant increase of N1 or P2 amplitude to the left temporal lobe. It is not clear if the 
patients with tinnitus presented with an early “saturation” to the higher intensity of stimulus 
tones. 
Objectifying tinnitus by ERP was based on the assumption of differences in cortical 
auditory information processing between tinnitus complainers and controls. While N1 latency 
was generally recognized, it is more varied in our study to measure the sole N1 amplitude 
than measure the N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes. Our study chose N1-P2 as the indicative 
parameter because it is relevant to the activity of the auditory cortex as well as being
