Abstract 
The fabrication process and performance 
of the nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) p-i-n 
solar cells was studied. Firstly, the nc-Si:H 
films were deposited with a PECVD system 
by employing four different process 
techniques. The nc-Si:H films were 
characterized with micro-Raman 
spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 
field-emission scanning electron microscope 
(FE-SEM). Then, two different structures of 
nc-Si:H p-i-n solar cell were fabricated and 
their characteristics such as the short-circuit 
current (Isc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill 
factor (FF) and efficiency were measured. 
For the device structures, one was Al / 
n-a-Si:H / i-a-Si:H / p-a-SiC:H / ITO 
(indium tin oxide) /glass and the other was 
Al / n-a-Si:H / i-nc-Si:H / i-a-Si:H ( buffer 
layer )/ i-a-Si:H / p-a-SiC:H / ITO /glass. 
The measured results showed that the 
former one had a higher efficiency (~ 1.08%) 
and the later one had a little higher FF (~ 
0.278) under AM1.5.

2. INTRODUCTION 
Hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon 
(nc-Si:H) thin-film has been a subject of 
extensive studies over the last decade 
although it was prepared for the first time in 
1968 [1]. Nanocrystalline silicon film has 
higher carrier mobility, lower optical 
absorption, and higher doping efficiency as 
compared with their amorphous 
counterparts. Therefore, nanocrystalline 
silicon film is usually applied for thin-film 
transistor, single electron transistor, and 
p-i-n solar cell [2-3]. Many film deposition 
techniques, such as, electron cyclotron 
resonance (ECR) [4], very high frequency 
(VHF) [5], and hot wire (HW) CVD 
(chemical vapor deposition) have been 
proposed to grow nc-Si:H film. 
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(PECVD) has also been investigated for 
nc-Si:H film growth [6]. For PECVD 
system nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) 
thin-film was generally obtained by the 
 4
Two different structures of nc-Si:H p-i-n 
solar cell A and B were described as follows. 
For cell A, as depicted in Fig.1(a), the SiH4 
(4% diluted in H2), B2H6 (1% diluted in H2), 
and C2H2 (pure) gases were introduced into 
the chamber to deposit the 30 nm p-a-SiC:H 
layer. Then, the C2H2 and B2H6 gases were 
terminated to grow the 260 nm i-a-Si:H 
layer. Finally, PH3 (1% diluted in H2) was 
added into the reaction chamber to deposit 
the 30 nm n+-a-Si:H layer. For keeping the 
better interface properties, all of the films 
were deposited continuously, so the plasma 
was always kept “ON” during the whole 
deposition processes. For cell B, as depicted 
in Fig. 1(b), the SiH4 (4% diluted in H2), 
B2H6 (1% diluted in H2), and C2H2 (pure) 
gases were introduced into the chamber to 
deposit the 30 nm p-a-SiC:H layer. Then, 
the C2H2 and B2H6 gases were terminated to 
grow the 200 nm i-a-Si:H layer. Then, RF 
power was increased from 20 W to 100 W. 
After depositing the 350 nm i-a-Si:H buffer 
layer, the SiH4 gas were terminated. H2 
(pure) gas was then added into the reaction 
chamber to apply in-situ H2-plasma 
treatment on the a-Si:H buffer layer for 3 
min.. After plasma treatment, the SiH4 and 
H2 gases were introduced into chamber to 
deposit the 360 nm i-nc-Si:H. Finally, the H2 
gas was terminated. The SiH4 and PH3 (1% 
diluted in H2 ) gases were then added into 
the reaction chamber to deposit the 30 nm 
n+-a-Si:H layer.  
 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
(1) Effect of a-Si:H buffer layer: 
Figures 2(c) and (d) depict the 
micro-Raman spectrums of the nc-Si:H thin 
films of sample sets C and D, respectively. 
From Fig. 1, the Raman peak of film C4% 
was at ∼ 480 cm-1 which exhibiting an 
almost amorphous structure. With the 
increase in H2-dilution, the sharpness of the 
Raman spectrum increase and the 
contribution from the lower wave number 
distribution gradually reduces. When SiH4 
was diluted to 3% (C3%), the Raman 
spectrum had an apparent peak at 522 cm-1. 
Therefore, sample C3% contained both 
amorphous and crystalline phases [11]. With 
decreasing f to 2% and 1%, the peak at 520 
cm-1 disappeared, and the films returned to 
amorphous phase. From Fig. 2(d), it could 
be seen the phases of all films of sample set 
D were amorphous. Figures 3(c) and (d) 
show the XRD patterns of the nc-Si:H thin- 
films of sample sets C and D, respectively. 
There was an obvious peak appeared in the 
Fig. 3(c), mainly the <331> orientation of 
sample C2% nc-Si:H film [12]. Data from 
Raman scattering studies can give valuable 
information about the grain size and volume 
fraction of silicon nanocrystal within the 
film. The grain size estimated from XRD 
pattern of sample C3% was 3.3 nm. The 
Raman spectra were the analysis result of 
local structure in the film, but the XRD 
pattern obtained information from the whole 
sample. Therefore, there was a difference 
between the results from the Raman 
spectrum and XRD pattern. From the 
micro-Raman spectra and the XRD patterns 
of sample sets C and D, one could know that 
nc-Si:H films deposited on a-Si:H buffer 
layer, such as sample C3%, had the larger 
grain size and the higher Fc. This meant less 
amorphous parts and voids existed in the 
film, thus resulted in the better electronic 
properties of film.  
(2) Effect of stainless steel mesh: 
Figures 2(a) and 3(a) illustrate the 
micro-Raman spectra and XRD patterns of 
the nc-Si:H thin-films of sample set A, 
respectively. Comparing the micro-Raman 
spectra and the XRD patterns of sample sets 
A and C, one could find that nc-Si:H films 
deposited with the PECVD system having a 
stainless steel mesh, such as sample C3%, 
had the larger grain size and the higher Fc. 
In this work, the PECVD with stainless steel 
mesh differed from that without stainless 
steel mesh in which the substrate did not 
contact the plasma directly. The mesh was 
used to avoid the high energetic particles to 
directly bombard the substrate, so that the 
plasma-induced surface damage was 
minimized.

buffer layer:
