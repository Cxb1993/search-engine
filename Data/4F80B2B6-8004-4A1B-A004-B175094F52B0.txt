下肢癱瘓和雙癱病患穿戴膝矯具之矢狀面步態模型 
A sagittal-plane biomechanical model of human gait with knee orthoses 
for paraplegic and diplegic patients 
 
Introduction 
Paraplegia is the paralysis of lower extremities as a result of the impairment in motor or 
sensory function, and diplegia is a type of paralysis affecting one part of the body and the 
corresponding part on the other side of the body, usually both legs.  They are caused by spinal 
cord injuries, or a congenital disease e.g., spina bifida , which affects the neural elements of the 
spinal canal from the first thoracic spine downward. (And sometimes, the paralysis of both legs 
can also result from injuries to the brain.) The higher the level of injury is, the more functions the 
patient will lose.  In most cases, these patients who lose ability of walking would be wheelchair 
bound.  However, due to the lack of walking, paraplegia may cause numerous medical 
complications, such as muscular atrophy and osteoporosis, thrombosis, and metabolic problems.  
To ameliorate the complications, an orthotic device, reciprocating gait orthosis(RGO), was 
introduced.  Its reciprocating mechanism connects two hip joints allowing one to flex while the 
other side extends and vice versa.  Paraplegic patients with a fair or greater (grade 3 or up) 
strength of hip flexors were indicated.  The level of lesion should be below L2 to preserve the 
hip flexors.  The advantages of this orthosis include the restoration of walking and its associated 
physiological benefits. However, most patients rejected RGOs because of the high energy cost of 
ambulation with these orthoses. 
There have been two avenues to solve the problem of high energy cost, i.e., functional electric 
stimulation (FES) and active orthoses. A hybrid RGO which was a mechanical RGO instrumented 
with functional electric stimulation (FES) was studied and their data showed the lowest energy 
consumption was required compared with other RGOs.21  However, the energy consumption of 
the hybrid RGO was still much higher than that of normal walking and wheel chairs, and FES 
causes muscle fatigue that has to be solved before the FES assistive technology can be put in use 
for human walking. Another approach was the use of active orthoses8, in which the energy 
required for locomotion was provided by an external energy source and turned out to be heavy, 
bulky, and complex.  Most of them were only used to train patients to adapt to walk again8 in a 
hospital or laboratory. 
However, there were no studies investigate the knees of RGOs.  Most of knees of RGOs 
are immobile and this is most likely the reason why RGOs users present with high energy 
consumption. 
 
1.1 Literature review: 
1.1.1 Function of knees in gait 
In human normal gait, the knee is able to achieve the following function: 
1. Support body weight during the stance.  
2. Maintain the ambulation efficiency by adjusting the center of mass movements and limb 
length during the swing by flexing the knee1. 
3. Adapt various ambulation speeds. 
4. Generate a propulsion force at push-off. 
5. Absorb the shock of the body’s weight hitting the floor at heel strike. 
The hip, the knee, and the ankle work together and coordinate their movements to achieve 
overall goals, to keep the required energy of walking minimum. If any of the joints is fixed, the 
energy cost of the gait will increase especially when the knee is fixed. 18,19. The knee flexes to 
shorten the limb length to create foot clearance18 during the swing. If the knee is immobilized, 
there will be compensation movements, such as circumduction, vaulting, hip hiking, and external 
rotation 7, to clear the foot. In a self selected speed ambulation, the fixed knee increases the net 
oxygen cost by 20–33% 7.  
To maintain the efficiency of human walking, the knee also flexes to adjust the movements of 
the center of gravity in the stance phase.  The immobile knee would increase the vertical 
characteristics, more symmetric gait patterns 1, less compensations4, and higher walking speed.  
However, all of these SCOKJs were not able to perform the control of the slight flexion in the 
stance phase during gait because the knee has only two states of control (lock and unlock).  
There is a need to design a continuous control for an orthotic knee, the design idea of which has 
been already used in prosthetic knees.  They controlled the knee damping such that a smooth 
knee movement and near normal gait could be accomplished. . 
1.2.3 Prosthetic knees 
The prosthetic knees range from pure mechanical design for fixed cadence knees, 
pneumatic knees or hydraulic knees for variable cadence, to microprocessor controlled hydraulic 
knees, such as C-Leg.  Recently, magnetorheological fluids (MRF) were incorporated into 
microprocessor controlled knees 15-16 to control the knee movement. 
Magnetorheological fluids are new intelligent materials of which the rheological behavior 
changes in response to an applied magnetic field.  Herr and Wilkenfeld 15 developed a 
magnetorheological knee prosthesis which can automatically adapt knee damping to the gait 
using the information of axial forces, knee torques, and positions. When the knee flexes, each 
inner disk rotates with respect to two outer disk pairs. A thin film of MRF between each inner 
and outer disk pair was in the shear mode in response to the applied magnetic field to produce 
controllable damping and generate brakes (Figure1.4).  The force and motion information taken 
from the sensors was fed into the controller which then computed the required magnetic field 
according to the desired gait performance.  
 
Figure1.4  A magnetorheological prosthetic knee cited from Herr and Wilkenfeld15 
Kim and Oh16 developed a knee prosthesis using an MR damper concept . The rotary MR 
damper was made of a damper body, a flow pipe with controllable magnetic field and a rotary 
vane.  The pipe was filled with MR fluid used in a flow mode to produce a resistant force to the 
rotary vane which rotated as the knee extended or flexed (Figure1.5). In their study, the 
amputee’s swing leg was modeled as a two-link rigid body chain representing the thigh and the 
shank in sagittal plane motion. They applied computed torque method and PD feedback control 
algorithm.  
 
Material and Method: 
2.1 Orthotic System Description 
The orthotic system in this study was a conventional RGO except that the drop-lock knee was 
replaced by a new orthotic knee which allows knee flexion during gait. The movements of the hip 
joints are controlled by a reciprocating mechanism where one side flexes when the other side 
extends and vice versa. The orthotic knees provide controlled damping such that they can 
perform a near-normal function. The ankles are fixed and there are rocker bottoms on the 
soles.(Figure 2.1) 
  
Figure 2.1  An orthotic system for paraplegic patients 
In this research, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the new system.  The 
prototype will be designed in our future research where a clinical trial of the new design will be 
carried out as well. 
2.2 Model  
A model was developed to simulate the gait of a paraplegic patient when wearing a modified 
RGO described in previous section.  It was used to predict the performance of the RGO and 
particularly the knee motion, to control the knee, and to estimate the energy cost. It is a segmental 
model which consists of two shanks, two thighs, one pelvis and one HAT(head, arms, trunk) 
segments. The rocker bottom shapes were simplified as circular arcs according to the roll over 
shape method. (Figure 2.2)  
This model contains four sub-models: “single limb support”, “double limb support”, ”single 
limb support to double limb support” , and “double limb support to single limb support”13. In this 
model, it was assumed that: 1. sagittal plane movements only; 2. Rigid body segments; 3. Fixed 
ankles and roll-over shaped feet; 4. symmetrical legs. 
 
Figure 2.3  A nine-degree-of freedom system 
The motion equations were derived by Lagrange’s method.  To deal with the constraints by 
using the approach of Lagrange mulitplier, the equation of motion is: 
λABTK(q))qC(q,qqM T )(                                  (2.2) 
where )(qM  is the nn  dimensional vector of inertial matrix, ),( qqC  is the 1n  
dimensional vector Centripetal and Coriolis forces, )(qK is the 1n  vector gravitational force, 
T is the input forces of the center of the roll-over shape of stance foot and torque of respective 
joints, B  is Jacobian mapping of the applied forces and torques to the respective joints, λ  is 
the 1m  vector of the constraint forces corresponding to m  constraints, A  is mn  matrix 
of Jacobian of constraints. 
But Lagrange multiplier method is known to have problems of stability caused by numerical 
drift., embedding method was used to analyze the system with constraints. When a system has n  
motion equations and m  constraints, there will be mn   independent coordinates and m  
dependent coordinates. The embedding method can eliminate the Lagrange mutipliers and change 
the n  motion equations into mn   motion equations correspond to the mn   independent 
coordinates. In this method, q  is partitioned into independent iq and dependent dq parts, and 
A  is partitioned in the same way, i.e.,

2.2.3.3 Transition of Single limb support to double limb support 
 
When then roll-over shape of trailing leg contacts the ground, the model will transit single 
support mode to double support mode. This transition is modeled as a non-elastic and 
non-slipping rigid impact. And the impact is assumed to be instantaneous, so the configuration of 
the model is unchanged before and after impact. 
The impulse-momentum equations of this impact of the model: 
δλAδFqJqqMqqM TT   )()()(                        (2.24) 
where J is the Jacobian matrix of the impact point, δF  is the vector of the impulses, A  
is matrix of Jacobian of constraints. And the superscripts   and   mean the instant after 
and before impact. 
However, there are constraints witch are the same with constraints of single support mode. 
Embedding method is used, and then the equations can be modified as: 
δFqJqqMqqM )()()(   sdiTsdsdisdisdsdisdisd                   (2.25)

Introduction
• Spasticity
– velocity-dependent increase of tonic 
stretch refexes with exaggerated tendon 
jerks (Lance, 1980)
– Being mostly thought to be detrimental for 
Human Movement
– Could we work with it to improve the 
movement?
Plantarflexion Spasticity with
Hemiplegic Gait
• It was also found the the spasticity
during gait is negatively correlated to 
walking speed for stroke patients.
• The control of the plantarflexion
spasticity to reduce or to reverse its 
detrimental effects is an unsolved 
challenge for rehabilitation clinicians. 
Hinged AFOs with 
Plantarflexion Stops (PSAFOs)
• PSAFOs are prescribed for
– hemiplegic patients with stroke or cerebral palsy
– mild or marked spasticity
– normal dorsiflexion ROM
– assist dorsiflexion during terminal stance and 
increase push-off power generation during 
preswing
– stop the knee hyperextension tendency during 
stance and to facilitate the toe clearance during 
swing 
– allow free dorsiflexion of ankle joint to fulfill 
additional functional needs, such as ramp 
ascending.
Objectives
• to study the locomotor-specific spasticity of 
medial gastrocnemius in CVA patients 
• to investigate its role in the kinematics of 
pathological gait with PSAFO in different 
angles of dorsiflexion
– zero-degree
– five-degree dorsiflexion

Subjects and IRB 
• Fourteen hemiplegic adults (11 males and 3 
females) with a diagnosis of first stroke
– mean age = 54.0 years and standard deviation 
(S.D.) = 11.6 
– recruited from the Department of Rehabilitation 
Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital.  
– All subjects signed a consent form which was 
approved by the institutional review board at the 
hospital. 
Excluded Subjects 
• The exclusion criteria 
– Previous history of neurological diseases, diabetes, 
rheumatic, or orthopedic conditions that could 
interfere with gait. 
– The individuals with any unstable medical 
condition. 
Orthoses
• Each subject in this study was fitted with a 
hinged AFO with plantarflexion stop.
– The plantarflexion stop was set at zero degree (Z-
PSAFO, i.e., the neutral position), or five degrees of 
dorsiflexion (F-PSAFO)
– The subjects wore their own tennis shoes with the 
flat bottom recommended by our laboratory.
• All subjects came to the National Taiwan 
University Rehabilitation Engineering 
Research Center for orthotic services.  
• One orthotist took part in this study and was in 
charge of the services for all subjects.  
Electromyography Instrument
• Surface eletromyographic activities (EMG) 
were detected by the Ag/AgCl surface 
electrodes.  
• The active electrode was placed at medial 
gastrocnemeus 5 cm below the popliteal fossa, 
and the negative electrode was placed next to 
the active one with center to center distance of 
2 cm. 
• The analog signals were acquired by Gould 
polygraph and Biopack MP100 A/D converter 
(Gould Instrument Systems Inc., USA) with a 
sampling rate of 1200 Hz. 
Spasticity Assessment 
• In this study, the spasticity index was used 
– the slope of EMG-lengthening velocity relationship.  
• The negative slope of spasticity index indicated 
the muscle was not velocity-dependant, but the 
positive slope indicated velocity-dependant 
characteristics.  
• The higher the positive spasticity index, the 
greater the muscle tone would be .

for nonparetic side and paretic side
Discussion
PSAFOs and Gait kinematics
• The increased spasticity was found in hemiplegic
patients with five-degree PSAFOs. 
• The double limb support and pre-swing durations 
in subjects wearing five-degree PSAFOs were 
significantly less than that without PSAFO, and 
the loading response time increased with five-
degree PSAFOs.
• The kinematic pattern of five-degree and zero-
degree PSAFO were similar except that the pre-
swing duration was not significantly reduced.  
• Implications
– The PSAFOs enhanced the push-off of the non-paretic 
limb and lengthened the loading response of the paretic 
limb.  The confidence in using the paretic limb 
increased.
– The PSAFOs would shorten the pre-swing advancing 
of the paretic limb, especially the five-degree PSAFO.  
• There was no significant changes in walking 
speed. 
Five-degree PSAFOs
• There was significant increase in spasticity with 
five-degree PSAFOs. 
• It significantly increases the loading time 
(5%↑to 28%) and reduces the double limb 
support time of the paretic limb.
• significant reduction in pre-swing time (18%↓to 
7%)
• Implications
– The five-degree PSAFOs may support the foot to 
improve weight bearing in heel-strike of paretic limb
– They improved the push off of nonparetic limb. 
– Pre-swing duration decreased with statistically 
significant amount but it may cause stability problems.
Conclusion
• Chronic CVA subjects results in spastic 
equinus foot or dropfoot manifested with 
hyperreflexia of the paretic side.  
• The increase of dorsiflexion angle of the 
PSAFOs would increase the spasticity of 
gastrocnemius in the paretic limb for hemiplegic
patients.
• The increase of dorsiflexion angle of the 
PSAFOs did produce two changes in gait 
kinematics on the paretic side:
– The loading response duration would increase.
– The pre-swing duration would decrease.
• The connection between the increased spasticity
and the kinematics changes needs further 
investigation.
