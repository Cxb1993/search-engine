English Abstract 
 
The surfaces of bio-inert materials on which cells do not proliferate, differentiate nor 
de-differentiate have not yet been studied extensively. These materials are useful culturing and/or 
preserving embryonic stem (ES) cells and various other kinds of stem cells, including hematopoietic 
stem cells for regenerative medicine. The goal of this project is to develop and investigate the 
bio-inert materials for the preservation and cultivation of stem cells for regenerative medicine.  
We developed tissue culture flasks having different types of flexible and hydrophilic 
nano-segments from several types of Pluronic (PEO-PPO-PEO). We proposed that the existence of 
hydrophilic nano-segments (nano-brushes) of Pluronic on the tissue culture flasks induces bio-inert 
storage of stem cells, when the umbilical cord blood are stored and cultured in the tissue culture 
flasks having nano-brushes (i.e., Pluronic-immobilized flasks).  
The expression ratio of surface markers (CD34) on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
stored in Pluronic-immobilized flasks was significantly higher than that in polystyrene tissue 
culture flasks or commercially available bio-inert flasks (i.e., low cell-binding cultureware). This 
was due to the presence of flexible brush-like segments of Pluronic on the Pluronic-immobilized 
flask. A good correlation was found between the number of CD34+ cells and the ratio of viable 
CD34+ cells from cord blood in several flasks after five days of storage. Therefore, the high number 
of CD34+ cells was thought to have originated from the high viability of these cells stored in 
Pluronic-immobilized flasks. It was found that there was an optimal surface concentration of 
Pluronic on the Pluronic-immobilized flask surfaces for the preservation (high number and survival) 
of these stem and progenitor cells. The foregoing results were attributable to the high density of 
Pluronic nano-segments on the flask surface, limiting the movement of these flexible segments.

 所謂的 bio-inert 表面上細胞的分化與增殖與否及其相關機制尚未被廣泛研究。這些 bio-inert
材料普遍應用於胚胎幹細胞(ES cells)及其他幹細胞的培養與保存，其中包含了再生醫學應用
的血液幹細胞(hematopoietic stem cells)。本計畫的最終目標為開發及研究再生醫學應用上幹細
胞保存及培養之生物相容(bio-inert)材料。 
 我們所發展的生物相容材料是由不同種類柔韌且親水的奈米 Pluronic (PEO-PPO-PEO)片段
組成。當含有血液幹細胞的臍帶血被儲存及培養在由奈米 Pluronic 片段(奈米刷)組成的生物相

 由於表面改質上 Pluronic 之細胞培養盤含有柔韌的刷狀片段，因此相較於普通的細胞培養
盤以及市售之 bio-inert 培養盤，當血液幹細胞及其前趨細胞儲存於由 Pluronic 片段組成的生
物相容表面時，可大幅提高其表面抗原(CD34)的表現比例。由臍帶血儲存於不同培養盤五天
的結果顯示 CD34+細胞數以及 CD34+細胞的存活率呈現很好的相關性。由此可知，當細胞儲
存於 Pluronic 生物相容性材料時有著較高的 CD34+細胞存活率，因此導致較高的 CD34+細胞
數。前述的結果是由於較高的 Pluronic 奈米片段之表面密度限制了奈米刷的移動。在此計畫
中我們也發現了 Pluronic 生物相容性材料對於儲存(維持較高的存活率以及細胞數)幹細胞及

1-3. Significance and originality 
Cell culture materials on which cells proliferate and differentiate have been investigated by many 
researchers. However, the surfaces of bio-inert materials on which cells do not proliferate, differentiate nor 
de-differentiate have not yet been studied extensively. These materials are useful culturing and/or preserving 
embryonic stem (ES) cells and various other kinds of stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells for 
regenerative medicine. From our extensive studies of biomaterials and cell culture, we found that the stem 
cells are sensitive cells, which are easily going to die (i.e., leading to aptosis) when the stem cells are 
cultivated on conventional and non bio-inert materials. We found that the flexible and hydrophilic segments 
of nano-brushes (i.e., Pluronic) conjugated on the surface of the cell culture flasks lead to the effective 
preservation and high viability of hematopoietic stem cells in the Pluronic-immobilized flask. The 
mechanism and gene expression in the stem cells cultivated on the Pluronic-immobilized tissue culture flasks 
having nano-brushes will be investigated in this study. The importance of the material engineering in the 
regenerative medicine and clinical application was high lightened in this project, and these are the originality 
of this project. 
 
2. Object of this research 
The object of this project is (1) to develop the most appropriate bio-inert materials for the 
preservation and cultivation of various stem cells for regenerative medicine, and (2) to investigate 
the mechanism of the bio-inert characteristics of biomaterials having nano-brushes for stem cell 
survival from cell culture and gene expression in the stem cells, and (3) to show the importance of 
material engineering in the regenerative medicine from the development of bio-inert materials. 
 
3. Method 
 
3-1. Preparation of several types of bio-inert materials having nano-brushes 
Tissue culture flasks having different length, hydrophilicity and concentration of nano-brushes are 
prepared. PPO2000, PPO6000, PPO20000, Pluronic L62, Pluronic L64, Pluronic F68, Pluronic F88, Pluronic 
F108, Pluronic F127, PEO2000, PEO6000 and PPO20000 are selected as nano-segments as shown in Table 1. 
PEO (polyethylene oxide) and PPO (propylene oxide) blocks are contributed to be hydrophilic and 
hydrophilic blocks in Pluronic (PEO-PPO-PEO), respectively. The end group of –OH in PPO, Pluronic and 
PEO is activated from the reaction shown in Scheme 1. After carbonyldiimidazole (CDI)-activated Pluronic, 
CDI-activated PPO and CDI-activated PEO are prepared, the identification and reaction ratio of 
CDI-activated nano-segments are obtained from elementary analysis, IR and NMR measurements. Then, the 
tissue culture flasks coated with polylysine are immersed into the CDI-activated Pluronic, CDI-activated 
PPO and CDI-activated PEO solution for 24 h at 25 oC to prepare the tissue culture flasks having several 
nano-brushes. The surface concentration of Pluronic, PPO and PEO (nano-brushes) is regulated by 
concentration of the reaction solution of CDI-activated Pluronic, PPO and PEO. 
 
 
3-2. Characterization of several types of bio-inert materials having nano-brushes 
The coating amount of polylysine on the polylysine-coated flask is estimated from micro BCATM protein 
assay. Atomic analysis of the surface of Pluronic-immobilized flasks is performed using XPS (ESCA-3400, 
Kratos Analytical Ltd). The surface of Pluronic-immobilized flasks is also analyzed by ATR-FTIR 
antibody by a conventional method. The number of hematopoietic stem cells and their viability that are 
stored on the tissue culture flasks having several nano-brushes and conventional bio-inert flasks are 
investigated. The morphology of the stem cells is also monitored from inverted phase contrast microscopy. 
We investigate the effect of concentration, length and hydrophilicity of nano-brush on the tissue culture 
flasks on the number, viability and morphology of the hematopoietic stem cells. 
 
4. Results & Discussion 
4-1. Preparation of Pluronic-immobilized Flask.  
Tissue culture flasks having nano-segments (i.e., Pluronic F68 and F127) on their surfaces were 
prepared according to the reaction scheme shown in Scheme 1. Characterization of the 
Pluronic-immobilized flasks PL68-1, PL68-10, PL68-100, PL127-1, PL127-10 and PL127-100, 
which were used for the preservation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical 
cord blood, was as cited in our previous literature10,11 and the results are summarized in Table 2. 
Pluronic-immobilized flasks having different surface concentrations of Pluronic (CPluronic) were 
prepared in this study, and the water contact angle decreased with increasing CPluronic.

4-2. Number of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells.  
The preservation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood stored in 
these Pluronic-immobilized flasks was investigated next. To compare the effectiveness of 
Pluronic-immobilized flasks with their commercially available bio-inert counterparts, umbilical 
cord blood was stored at 4˚C in Pluronic-immobilized flasks as well as in conventional polystyrene 
tissue culture flasks (RepCellR), and in commercially available bio-inert flasks (HydroCellR, NuncR). 
This investigation was necessary because hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are very sensitive 
to the cell culture environment, which determines whether they can grow and survive without 
differentiation. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are known to express several characteristic 
surface markers (e.g., CD34),17,18 and lose this expression after differentiation. 
Flow cytometric analysis of surface markers was performed on hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells after storage of umbilical cord blood in the flasks. The surface of RepCellR flasks 
was reported to be modified with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) by electron-beam 
polymerization,19 while the surface of HydroCellR flasks was composed of a bio-inert material. 
NuncR flasks were coated with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) copolymer.20 
 5
F127, also showed the same trends as obtained with the PL127 flasks. The number of CD34+ cells 
in umbilical cord blood stored on PL68-10 was higher than for PL68-1 or PL68-100. Because 
PL68-10 had a higher surface concentration of Pluronic than did PL68-1, and a lower surface 
concentration than PL68-100, it was shown to be necessary to have an optimal concentration of 
Pluronic on the surface of these flasks for the preservation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells from umbilical cord blood. 
4-3. Survival of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells.  
The viability ratio of CD34+ cells was also analyzed, using a propidium iodide exclusion method. 
This ratio was defined as the number of viable CD34+ cells divided by the total number of CD34+ 
cells. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the number and viability ratio of CD34+ cells from 
umbilical cord blood grown in PL127-1, PL127-10, PL127-100, PL68-1, PL68-10 and PL68-100; 
conventional polystyrene tissue culture; RepCellR; and commercially available bio-inert flasks (i.e., 
NuncR and HydroCellR) after storage for five days at 4˚C. A good correlation was found between 
the number and viability ratio of CD34+ cells for several flasks. Therefore, a high number of CD34+ 
cells obtained from umbilical cord blood likely originated from the high viability of such cells when 
stored in the Pluronic-immobilized flasks (particularly PL127-1, PL127-10, PL68-1 and PL68-10).

4-4. Plasma protein adsorption on the Pluronic-immobilized flask surfaces.  
Plasma proteins are adsorbed on the surface of a flask when umbilical cord blood contacts the 
flask, before blood cells (including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) encounter this surface. 
Therefore, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells contact the surface of the flask through the 
adsorbed plasma proteins. The high number and viability ratio of CD34+ cells from umbilical cord 
blood stored in Pluronic-immobilized flasks might be related to the conformation and amount of 
plasma proteins on the surfaces of these flasks. Therefore, the adsorption of plasma proteins from 
platelet-poor plasma on the various flasks used in this study was also investigated. Figure 4 shows 
the normalized amount of albumin adsorbed on the flasks from platelet-poor plasma where the

progenitors forming bone marrow than CD34 (ER = 14.4%) and CD133 (ER = 7.0%). Therefore, primitive 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells tend to adhere to polyurethane (PU) membrane surfaces, due to their 
expression of these cell-adhesion molecules on their surfaces.  
 
The exact surface marker for primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells remains unclear at the 
current time. Isolating such cells by membrane filtration of umbilical cord or bone marrow is thought to be 
more effective than magnetic bead or flow cytometry sorting methods, because cell separation in membrane 
filtration is based not only on cell size, but also on the intensity of cell adhesion to the membrane surface. Of 
all methods, membrane separation is likely to provide the most sanitary and simple isolation of primitive 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Efficient cell separation is important for the successful isolation and purification of blood cells, stem 
cells and specific tissue cells. Techniques such as centrifugation, affinity column chromatography, 
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), magnetic cell selection, and membrane filtration are typically 
employed for cell separation. The centrifugal separation of cells is a typical method employed to isolate 
platelets, leukocytes, mononuclear cells, red blood cells and non-blood cells. Highly purified cellular 
preparations are obtained using FACS or a magnetic cell selection system in conjunction with a 
fluorescently-labeled antibody as the cell-surface marker. Cell separation through membrane filtration was 
recently reported by several researchers. Leukocyte removal filters are commercially available cell separation 
filters. 
The stem cells that form blood and immune cells are known as hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic 
stem and progenitor cells bear the CD34 cell surface marker. These cells are thought to be responsible for the 
reconstitution of hematopoiesis. Therefore, the transplantation of CD34+ cells is essential in the therapy of 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myeloid leukemia and systemic 
mastocytosis. 
In a previous investigation (A. Higuchi et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 68A, 34 (2004)), cell separation 
from peripheral blood at fixed blood permeation speeds (1 ml/min) was investigated using surface-modified 
polyurethane (PU) membranes with a fixed pore size of 5 μm, carrying different functional groups. However, 
optimal conditions for the purification of CD34+ cells from blood using membrane filtration were still 
undetermined. In this study, we prepared several of the membranes, and conducted further experiments on 
the separation of CD34+ cells using the membranes. 
 
Cell separation from peripheral blood was investigated using polyurethane (PU) foam membranes having 
5.2 μm pore size and coated with Pluronic F127 or hyaluronic acid. The permeation ratio of hematopoietic 
stem cells (CD34+ cells) and lymphocytes through the membranes was lower than for red blood cells and 
platelets. Adhered cells were detached from membrane surfaces using human serum albumin solution after 
permeation of blood through the membranes, allowing isolation of CD34+ cells in the permeate (recovery) 
solution. High-yield isolation of CD34+ cells was achieved using Pluronic-coated membranes. This was 
because the Pluronic coating dissolved into the recovery solution at 4oC, releasing adhered cells from the 
surfaces of the membranes during permeation of human serum albumin solution through these membranes. 
Dextran and/or bovine serum albumin solutions were also evaluated for use as recovery solutions after blood 
permeation. A high recovery ratio of CD34+ cells was achieved at 4oC in a process using 20% dextran 
solution through polyurethane (PU) membranes having carboxylic acid groups. CD34+ (hematopoietic stem) 
cells were efficiently recovered (85% recovery ratio) through PU-COOH membranes in a process using 20 
wt% aqueous dextran as the recovery solution. This indicated that dextran solution was preferable to HSA 
and BSA solutions during the recovery process.  
 
Forraz et al. (Stem Cells 22, 100 (2004)) reported that negative-isolated cells, which depleted umbilical 
cord blood mononuclear cells from blood cells expressing mature hematopoietic markers (glycophorin A, 
CD2, CD3, CD7, CD16, CD33, CD38, CD45 and CD56), lineage-negative cells, enriched long-term 
culture-initiating cells. The lineage-negative cells maintained and expanded more primitive hematopoietic 
stem and progenitor cells than CD34+ and CD133+ cells, and expressed higher levels of the cell-adhesion 
molecule CD162 [expression ratio (ER) = 16.0%] and CD164 (ER = 96.7%) involved in hematopoietic 
progenitors forming bone marrow than CD34 (ER = 14.4%) and CD133 (ER = 7.0%). Therefore, primitive 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells tend to adhere to polyurethane (PU) membrane surfaces, due to their 
expression of these cell-adhesion molecules on their surfaces.
