characteristics include the gate-voltage swing 
(GVS) of 1.15 (1.2) V, two-terminal gate-drain 
breakdown voltage (BVGD) of -14.4 (-15.8) V, 
and the turn-on voltage (Von) of 0.92 (1.147) V 
at 450 (300) K, respectively.  
Nevertheless, the low-temperature growth 
restrictions of the In0.3Ga0.7AsN0.01/GaAs 
heterosturcture were found to seriously degrade 
the electron transport performance. 
Consequently, we have further devised an 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01(Sb)/GaAs HFET by 
incorporating the surfactant-like Sb atoms into 
the dilute nitride channel to improve crystalline 
quality and carrier confinement capability at 
the same time. The proposed 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01(Sb)/GaAs HFET has 
achieved superior stable thermal characteristics, 
including ∂Vth/∂T of -0.807 mV/K and a 
high-temperature linearity (∂GVS/∂T) of -0.053 
mV/K. It has also demonstrated a peak 
extrinsic transconductance (gm, max) of 94 (109) 
mS/mm at 450 (300) K. Improved carrier 
transport and comprehensive device 
performance have been achieved in this work. 
 
三、前言與研究目的 
The quaternary dilute-nitride compounds 
of InxGa1-xAs1-yNy have been extensively 
studied in the past few years [1],[2]. The 
InGaAsN/GaAs heterostructures possess the 
advantages of an improved electron 
confinement at high temperatures due to the 
high barriers of their conduction-band 
discontinuities. Long-wavelength, 1.2~1.3 μm 
laser diodes with InxGa1-xAs1-yNy or 
InGaAsNSb compounds grown on the GaAs 
substrates have attracted great interest [3]-[5]. 
InGaAsN-based heterojunction bipolar 
transistors (HBTs) [6]-[8] have also 
demonstrated significant reductions in the 
turn-on voltage compared with AlGaAs-based 
HBTs. Recently, effort has also been devoted to 
incorporating surfactant Sb atoms into the 
InGaAsNSb/GaAs quantum well (QW) laser to 
improve the crystal quality and to suppress the 
three-dimensional (3D) growth [9]-[11]. 
Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no attempts 
have yet been made to incorporate Sb atoms in 
high-speed devices.  
Therefore, this work investigates, for the 
first time, Sb/N-incorporated HFET devices 
with dilute In0.3Ga0.7AsN0.01/GaAs or 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01(Sb)/GaAs heterosturctures, 
respectively.  
 
四、研究方法 
 Both of the In0.3Ga0.7AsN0.01/GaAs and 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01(Sb)/GaAs HFETs were 
grown by a Riber Epineat solid-source MBE 
system. A radio-frequency (RF) coupled 
plasma source was employed to generate the 
reactive nitrogen radicals from the high-purity 
N2 gas. The intensity of the plasma can be 
controlled by the RF power and the flow rate 
of N2. A photodetector was used to measure 
  4
and the resulting nonradiative impurities with 
increasing nitrogen concentration in the 
InGaAsN compound have seriously degraded 
the electron transport property. The crystalline 
property has been improved as incorporating 
the surfactant-like Sb atoms into the dilute 
nitride channel. 
Standard photolithography, lift-off, and 
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) were employed 
for the device fabrication. AuGeNi/Au alloys 
were used for the source/drain ohmic contacts, 
onto which Au was evaporated to reduce the 
contact resistance. Au was deposited on the 
undoped GaAs Schottky layer as the gate 
electrode. The gate dimensions were 1 × 200 
μm2 and the drain-to-source spacing of 7 µm. 
Mesa etching was performed down to the 
buffer layer to reduce the gate leakage current, 
and a H3PO4/H2O2/H2O solution was used for 
etching the GaAs cap layer. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
(I) InGaAsN/GaAs HFET: 
Figure 2 shows the SIMS profile to verify 
of the growth of the InGaAsN/GaAs HFET. 
The corresponding conduction-band diagrams 
of the InGaAsN/GaAs HFET (solid line) and 
that of using a conventional InGaAs channel 
(dotted line) have also been shown in Fig. 1(a). 
The conduction band discontinuity (ΔEC) of the 
InxGa1-xAs/GaAs (0 < x < 0.3) heterojunction 
can be expressed by ΔEC = 0.75x eV [15], 
indicating that discontinuity value is linearly 
proportional to the indium composition, x. On 
the other hand, the ΔEC value of the 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01/GaAs heterostructure was 
determined to be 401 meV [16], which is about 
176 meV larger than that of In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs 
interface. Consequently, the use of 
In0.3Ga0.7As0.99N0.01 nitride as the channel 
material can enhance the ΔEC and improve the 
channel confinement capability.  
Figure 3 shows the typical current-voltage 
characteristics of the InGaAsN/GaAs HFET at 
300 K. Good pinch-off characteristics have 
been achieved. It is mainly due to the use of a 
thick and undoped GaAs buffer and the 
increased discontinuities (ΔEC) at the 
channel/buffer interface to reduce the electron 
injection at low gate biases. Figure 4 depicts 
the extrinsic transconductance (gm) and 
saturation drain-source saturation current 
density (IDSS) characteristics as a function of 
gate-source bias (VGS) at elevated temperatures, 
ranging from 300 K to 450 K, respectively. 
gm,max and IDSS were found to 66.4 mS/mm and 
70 mA/mm at 300 K, respectively. The 
observed lower gm, max and IDSS values, as well 
as the lower electron mobility characterized by 
Hall measurement, as compared to 
  6
temperature, resulted from the enhanced 
scattering mechanisms. However, the 
breakdown voltage was observed to decrease 
form 390 K to 450 K, as shown in Fig. 6. 
Interesting polarity change may be due to the 
switching of dominant mechanism from the 
former scattering phenomenon at lower 
temperatures to the combinational effects of the 
enhanced barrier-lowering, the tunneling, and 
the reduced effective bandgap [25] mechanisms 
at higher temperatures.  
Table I Comparison of breakdown voltage (BVGD) 
and turn-on voltage (Von) with other GaAs-based 
HFET’s. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 shows the temperature-dependent 
characteristics of gm, max and the threshold 
voltage (Vth), respectively, from 300 K to 450 K 
at VDS = 3 V. The values of Vth are -1.817, 
-1.833, -1.852, -1.883, -1.925, and -1.978 V at 
300 K, 330 K, 360 K, 390 K, 420 K, and 450 K, 
respectively. The threshold shift (ΔVth) from 
300 K to 450 K is only 0.161 V. The thermal 
threshold coefficient (∂Vth/∂T) is superiorly to 
be -1.07 mV/K. The studied device also 
demonstrates improved thermal threshold 
stability than those of other HFETs, as 
compared in Table II [22], [24-26].  
The microwave characteristics of the 
studied HFET were characterized by an 
HP8510B vector network analyzer in 
conjunction with the Cascade probes over the 
range from 0.5 GHz to 20 GHz. The unity gain 
cut-off frequency (fT) and the maximum 
oscillation frequency (fmax) of the studied 
InGaAsN/GaAs HFET are 8.34 GHz and 9.84 
GHz, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8, at VDS = 
4 V and VGS = -0.5 V at 300 K. 
Table II Comparison of thermal threshold coefficient 
(∂Vth/∂T) with other GaAs-based HFET’s. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(II) InGaAsN(Sb)/GaAs HFET: 
As described in previous sections, though 
the introduction of N atoms into InGaAs can 
improve the carrier confinement capability, the 
crystalline quality needs to be improved. 
Besides, the incorporation of Sb atoms into 
InGaAsN/GaAs-based optoelectronic devices 
cannot only improve the threshold current 
  8
camel-like HFET [18] and 1.66 mV/K of the 
GaAs/InGaAs HFET [19]. The linearity of 
device performance is essential for power 
application. A good linearity of the device 
characteristics can provide a wide gate-bias 
region and reduce the distortion under 
high-power operation. Besides, the thermal 
GVS coefficient indicates the variation of GVS 
at elevated temperatures. Lower ∂GVS/∂T 
values indicate more stable linearity of the 
device under high-power application. The 
achieved high-temperature GVS linearity is 
mainly attributed to the improved carrier 
confinement capability, since the 
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), which 
tends to be repelled by the decreased gate bias, 
is effectively retarded by the enhanced 
channel/buffer discontinuity. In this work, the 
incorporation of Sb atoms can further increase 
the heterostructure discontinuity by decreasing 
the energy band gap of the InGaAsN(Sb) 
channel. Thus, the high-temperature 
performances of the device gain, current drive 
capability, and the GVS linearity can be 
comprehensively improved. 
Figure 12 shows the temperature-dependent 
characteristics of gm, max and the threshold 
voltage (Vth) from 300 to 450 K at VDS = 3 V. 
Similar to the observed increased current 
density and maintained pinch-off property at 
450 K, as shown in Fig. 9, the channel 
confinement capability of the proposed device 
was effectively improved due to the decreased 
energy band gap and enhanced discontinuity 
barrier. Consequently, the 2DEG was not 
drained by substrate leakage and was well 
confined in the channel to maintain the gate 
modulation capability at 450 K, leading to 
improved gm performance at high temperatures. 
The values of Vth are -1.592/-1.601/-1.623/ 
-1.643/-1.678/-1.713 V at 300/330/360/390 
/420/450 K, respectively. The threshold shift 
(ΔVth) from 300 K to 450 K is only 0.161 V. 
The thermal threshold coefficient (∂Vth/∂T) has 
a superior value of -0.807 mV/K. The studied 
device also demonstrates improved thermal 
threshold stability compared with other HFETs 
[22], [24]-[26], as shown in Table III. Since the 
threshold characteristics are closely related to 
the excessive leakage current through the 
substrate, the devices in Table I are all assumed 
to be under similar drain-bias conditions to 
make a fair comparison. The present device 
exhibited the greatest thermal threshold 
stability. This is also attributed to the use of the 
InGaAsN(Sb) dilute channel with the enhanced 
discontinuity barrier to provide enhanced 
channel confinement capability at high 
temperatures. This is similar to the observed 
improved pinch-off characteristics, as discussed

二、英文摘要 
This project work reports for the first time 
a high electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) 
using a dilute antimony In0.2Ga0.8AsSb channel 
and a novel In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs hetero- 
structure doped-channel field-effect transistor 
(DCFET), both grown by the molecular beam 
epitaxy (MBE) system. The interfacial qualities 
within the InGaAsSb/GaAs quantum well (QW) 
of the HEMT or DCFET devices were 
effectively improved by introducing the 
surfactant-like Sb atoms during the growth of 
the InGaAs layer. The improved 
heterostructural quality and electron transport 
properties have also been verified by various 
surface characterization techniques. In 
comparison, the proposed HEMT with (without) 
the incorporation of Sb atoms has 
demonstrated the maximum extrinsic 
transconductance (gm, max) of 227 (180) mS/mm,

concentration characteristics. 
during the growth of the InGaAs channel by 
setting the cracked cell temperature at 550℃ 
for the Sb valve. The growth temperatures for 
the InGaAsSb and GaAs layers were set around 
510℃ and 600℃, respectively. 
Figures 1-2 show the device cross section 
of the proposed In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs HEMT 
and DCFET, respectively. In Fig. 1, the 
epitaxial structure of the In0.2Ga0.8AsSb /GaAs 
HEMT consists of a 0.4-μm GaAs buffer layer 
on a (100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs 
substrate, sequentially followed by a 9.5-nm 
In0.2Ga0.8AsSb channel, a 4-nm undoped GaAs 
spacer layer, a 20-nm Si-doped (5 × 1018 cm-3) 
GaAs carrier supply layer, a 15-nm undoped 
GaAs Schottky layer, and finally a 20-nm 
Si-doped (7 × 1018 cm-3) GaAs cap layer. An 
identical InGaAs/GaAs HEMT structure, 
except without incorporating the Sb atoms into 
the InGaAs channel, was also grown to provide 
direct comparison. Hall measurements were 
carried out on the proposed InGaAsSb/GaAs 
HEMT and the conventional InGaAs/GaAs 
HEMT samples to characterize the 
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) 
concentration (n2DEG) and the electron mobility 
(μn) under a magnetic field of 5000 G. The 
values of μ n and the corresponding n2DEG 
were 2951 (2340) cm2/V-s and 3.1 (3) × 1012 
cm-2 for the InGaAsSb (InGaAs)/GaAs HEMT 
at 300 K, respectively. Almost 26 % 
improvement on the electron mobility with 
similar 2DEG concentrations has been 
observed and verified the enhanced transport 
property by the Sb incorporation. 
Besides, In Fig. 2, the epitaxial structure 
of the proposed In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET 
consists of a 0.4-μm GaAs buffer layer on a 
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate, 
sequentially followed by a 9.5-nm thick 
Si-doped In0.2Ga0.8AsSb channel (5 × 1018 
cm-3), a 4-nm undoped GaAs spacer layer, a 
35-nm undoped GaAs Schottky layer, and 
finally a 20-nm Si-doped (7 × 1018 cm-3) GaAs 
cap layer. For the present In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs 
DCFET, the characterized the two-dimensional 
electron gas concentration (n2DEG) and electron 
mobility (μn) are 3.82 × 1012 cm-2 and 2674 
cm2/V-s at 300 K, respectively. The proposed 
In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET has demonstrated 
superior transport properties with comparable 
2DEG concentrations and InGaAs channel 
compositions as compared to other DCFET 
reports [16-18], as shown in Table I. The 
improved transport properties are mainly due 
to the Sb-incorporation in the InGaAs 
doped-channel, which will be discussed later. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Standard photolithography, lift-off and the 
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) techniques were 
employed for the fabrication of both devices. 
The mesa etching process was performed down 
to the buffer layer to reduce the gate leakages 
current. The H3PO4/H2O2/H2O solution was 
used as the wet-etching solution for the GaAs 
cap layer. AuGeNi alloys were used for the 
source/drain ohmic contacts, onto which Au 
was evaporated to reduce the contact resistance. 
Au was deposited on the undoped GaAs 
Schottky layer as the gate electrode. The gate 
dimensions were 1.2 × 200 μm2 with the 
[18][17] [16]
  18
the Sb atoms within the InGaAs QW channel.  
Possible reason for the observed lower IV 
slopes in linear region of the InGaAsSb/GaAs 
sample than those of the InGaAs/GaAs sample 
is due to the control issue of the thermal 
evaporator system. Nevertheless, the 
InGaAsSb/GaAs sample did overcome the 
differences in contact resistance and 
demonstrated higher saturation current 
densities than the InGaAs/GaAs sample. This 
also proves that the transport property has been 
significantly enhanced at high electric field due 
to the improved interfacial quality and carrier 
confinement by the Sb incorporation. 
Figure 7 indicates the gm, max and IDSS 
characteristics versus the applied gate-source 
bias for the studied InGaAsSb/GaAs and the 
conventional InGaAs/GaAs HEMTs at 300 K, 
respectively, with VDS = 3 V. The values of the 
gm, max and the drain-source current density (IDS) 
measured at VGS = 2 V, are 227 (181) mS/mm 
and 473 (421) mA/mm at 300 K for the studied 
HEMT with (without) adding the Sb atoms into 
the InGaAs channel, respectively.  
Significant improvement of about 25 % in 
gm value has been successfully achieved by 
employing the dilute antimony channel. 
Defining the GVS to be the available 
gate-source bias range at the drop of 10 % from 
the gm, max value, the proposed InGaAsSb/GaAs 
HEMT has demonstrated a wider GVS of 
1.215 V (-0.715 V ≤ VGS ≤0.5 V) than 1.15 V 
(-0.75 V ≤ VGS ≤ 0.4V) of the conventional 
InGaAs/GaAs HEMT, as shown in Fig. 7. 
Possible reasons to account for the increased 
GVS are: (1) the slight increase of the 2DEG 
concentration due to the decreased bandgap in 
the InGaAsSb/GaAs QW [20]-[24]; (2) the 
enhanced channel confinement capability due 
the increased channel/buffer discontinuities to 
suppress the substrate leakages at higher 
channel potentials [25]. Thus, more negative 
gate bias was required to deplete the carriers in 
the InGaAsSb channel. Consequently, 
improved device linearity with higher 
transconductance gain and enhanced current 
drive capability has been accomplished in the 
present InGaAsSb/GaAs device. The 
microwave characteristics of the studied 
devices were characterized by using an 
HP8510B vector network analyzer in 
conjunction with the cascade probes over the 
range of from 0.5 GHz to 20 GHz. The gate 
dimensions were 1.2 × 200 µm2. The unity gain 
cut-off frequency (fT) and the maximum 
oscillation frequency (fmax) were determined to 
be 25 (20.6) and 28.3 (25.6) GHz at 300 K for 
the present HEMT with (without) the dilute 
antimony channel, respectively, with VDS = 2.5 
V and VGS = -0.75 V. 
 
(II) In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET: 
Figure 8 shows the secondary ion mass 
spectrometry (SIMS) intensity as a function of 
the depth of the In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET. 
The In0.2Ga0.8AsSb dilute channel is inserted 
about 59 nm below the wafer surface. The 
SIMS measurement profile also indicates the 
stable compositions of both Ga and As during 
the sample growth. On the other hand, the In, 
Si and Sb ion compositions were increased to 
their maximums at about 60 nm deep. The 
SIMS profiles have demonstrated the 
successful incorporations of the Sb and Si 
atoms within the channel growth. The Sb 
atoms reacted like surfactants to be slightly 
incorporated into the InGaAs film to improve 
the crystalline quality. 
Though the academic studies of 
  20
gate bias range at a 10% drop from the gm, max 
value. The GVS characteristics of the proposed 
device are superiorly high to be 1.65 (1.71) V 
at 300 (450) K, which is higher than that of the 
uniform channel HFET (1.45 V) [28]. Though 
the GVS value of this work is lower than that 
of the V-shape channel HFET (1.75 V) [28], 
yet the V-shaped graded-channel structure [28] 
can also be used in the proposed 
In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET to further 
improve the GVS linearity property. 
Figures 12-13 show the two-terminal 
gate-drain current-voltage characteristics of the 
In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET at different 
temperatures. The reverse gate-drain 
breakdown voltage (BVGD) is defined to be the 
gate-to-drain voltages, at which the gate 
current density reaches 1 mA/mm. The 
measured BVGD values are -14.6 V, -14.8 V, 
-14.9 V, -14.8 V, -14.4 V, and -13.9 V at 300 
K, 330 K, 360 K, 390 K, 420 K, and 450 K, 
respectively. It is noted that the breakdown 
voltage increases with the temperature from 
300 K to 360 K, as shown in Fig. 12.  
This is mainly attributed to the degraded 
transport characteristics and the decreased gate 
current density by the enhanced scattering 
mechanism at elevated temperatures. However, 
the breakdown voltages were observed to 
decrease from 360 K to 450 K, as shown in Fig. 
13. Interesting polarity change is mainly due to 
the switching of the dominant mechanism from 
the previously described scattering mechanism 
to the combinational effects of the enhanced 
barrier-lowering phenomenon, the enhanced 
tunneling mechanism, and the decreased 
bandgap above 360 K. Consequently, the 
electron injection was increased to deteriorate 
the breakdown characteristics at higher 
temperatures.  
Figure 14 shows the temperature- 
dependent characteristics of gm, max and the 
threshold voltage (Vth) from 300 to 450 K at 
VDS = 3 V. The values of Vth are -2.034 V, 
-2.052 V, -2.062 V, -2.085 V, -2.116 V, and 
-2.139 V at 300 K, 330 K, 360 K, 390 K, 420 
K, and 450 K, respectively. The threshold shift 
(ΔVth) from 300 K to 450 K is only 0.105 V, 
with a superior thermal threshold coefficient 
(∂Vth/∂T) of -0.7 mV/K. The studied device has 
also demonstrated improved thermal threshold 
stability as compared to other HFETs [14, 
28-30],as also listed in Table II. Superior 
thermal threshold stability is mainly due to the 
improved channel confinement capability in 
the In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/ GaAs QW structure with 
devised high discontinuity barriers. 
The microwave characteristics of the 
studied devices were characterized by using an 
HP 8510B vector network analyzer in 
conjunction with the cascaded probes over the 
range of from 0.5 GHz to 20 GHz as shown in 
Fig. 15. fT and fmax were determined to be 12.5 
GHz and 25 GHz, respectively, at 300 K with 
VDS = 3.5 V and VGS = -1.5 V for the proposed 
In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET. 
六、結論 
In conclusion, a novel dilute antimony 
channel In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs HEMT and an 
In0.2Ga0.8AsSb/GaAs DCFET with a dilute 
antimony-doped-channel, both grown on GaAs 
substrates have been successfully investigated 
for the first time. By introducing the Sb atoms 
into the InGaAs channel to serve as surfactants 
can effectively improve the crystalline quality 
of the InGaAsSb/GaAs heterointerface. In 
addition, the decreased energy bandgap of the 
dilute antimony channel can significantly

二、英文摘要 
Dual-composition-graded InP/ 
In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15/InxGa1-xAs1-ySby (x = 
0.53 → 0.63 → 0.53, y = 0.01 → 0.02 → 
0.01)/In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15 metamorphic high- 
electron-mobility transistors (MHEMTs) have 
been comprehensively and physically 
investigated with respect to modified Schottky 
barrier heights. Kink effects were found to be 
effectively relieved by forming the high 
Schottky barrier of Pt/In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15, as 
compared to Ni/InP and Ni/ 
In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15, upon the same epitaxial 
structure of device. It is found to be achieved by 
the effective suppression of impact ionization 
phenomena though both the gate depletion of 
channel electrons and significant reduction of 
thermionic emission caused by the high 
Schottky barrier. High-temperature device 
characteristics at 300-450 K are also studied. 
Excellent thermal threshold stability due to 
compromised temperature-dependent variations 
in barrier lowering and carrier scattering 
mechanisms are achieved and investigated.

In0.52Al0.48As spacer layer, a Si δ-doping layer 
with the doping concentration of 4 × 1012 cm-2, 
a 250 Å undoped In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15 barrier 
layer, a 25 Å undoped InP etch-stop layer, and 
finally a 300 Å n+-In0.53Ga0.47As (n+ = 1 × 1019 
cm-3) capping layer. 
TABLE I  Layer structures of samples A, B, and C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The In/Sb compositions of the 
InxGa1-xAs1-ySby channel were devised to be 
linearly increased from both channel/spacer 
heterointerfaces (x/y =0.53/0.01) to the central 
part of the channel (x/y =0.63/0.02). A 
V-shaped profile of the conduction band edge 
(EC) in the InGaAsSb channel can be formed. 
Since most of the two-dimensional electron gas 
(2DEG) is located at the bottom of the 
V-shaped channel, the conduction band 
discontinuities (ΔEC’s) of the InAlAs/InGaAsSb 
QW can be effectively increased to improve the 
channel confinement capability. 
  Standard photolithography, lift-off, and 
the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) techniques 
were employed for the device fabrication 
process. Mesa wet-etching was performed 
first for the studied MHEMTs down to the 
InAlAs MB to provide electrical isolation. 
AuGeNi alloy was used as the source/drain 
ohmic contacts, onto which Au was 
evaporated to reduce the contact resistance 
through RTA. After deposition of source/drain 
electrodes, selective gate-recess etching was 
performed to remove the In0.53Ga0.47As 
capping layer by using the etching solution of 
H3PO4：H2O2：H2O = 1：1：30. Then, gate 
photolithography, Ni/Au metallization on the 
InP barrier, and the following lift-off 
processes were conducted sequentially to 
define the gate electrode for sample A, as 
illustrated in Table I. For samples B and C, a 
second gate-recess was performed by using 
the HCl solution to remove the InP layer and 
expose the In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15 barrier, after 
the removal of In0.53Ga0.47As. Then, Ni/Au 
and Pt/Au alloys were evaporated onto the 
exposed In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15 to form the 
Schottky gates for samples B and C, 
  30
samples A, B, and C were determined to be 281, 
304, and 349 mS/mm. Higher gm, max values of 
samples B and C than that of sample A are due 
to decreased spacing between gate and the 
2DEG channel, since their gate electrodes were 
deposited on the InAlAsSb surface after the 
double gate-recess processing. The gate 
modulation capability upon the 2DEG can then 
be enhanced to achieve high gm, max 
performance. In addition, sample C also shows 
higher gm, max than sample B and other 
studies23-25. It is because that kink effects have 
been effectively relieved in sample C than 
sample B, which will be discussed later. 
Therefore, larger variation in saturation IDS 
(ΔIDS) can be obtained with respect to the same 
VGS variation (ΔVGS). This leads to the 
improved gm,max characteristic in sample C, 
since gm is defined as ΔIDS/ΔVGS. Also, IDSS is 
defined to be the saturation IDS at VGS = 0 V. 
Comparable IDSS (maximum IDS, IDS, max) values 
were observed to be 568 (683) mA/mm and 
557 (662) mA/mm in samples A and B. 
Nevertheless, sample C has exhibited the 
highest current drive capability of 626 (703) 
mA/mm, mainly due to its high gm performance. 
The studied MHEMTs have shown higher IDSS 
densities than other works23, 25. Superior gm, max 
and current drive with good gate-drain isolation 
in sample C indicates its promising output 
power and P.A.E. performance. The Vth values 
of samples A, B, and C, determined by 
extrapolating the square root of IDS in Fig. 4, 
are -2.44, -2.35, and -2.23 V, respectively. Vth 
can be expressed26 as,  
ε
φ )(2 ddDEGn

thV
Δ+⋅−Δ−=  (1) 
where q is the electron charge, ε is the 
dielectric constant of the Schottky layer, n2DEG 
is the 2DEG concentration in the channel, and 
(d + Δd) is the effective distance between the 
gate and the 2DEG location. Higher ΦB and 
shorter (d + Δd) distance in sample B and C 
explain for their higher Vth values than that of 
sample A. Besides, decreased n2DEG 
concentration due to extended depletion region 
in the channel caused by the high Schottky 
barrier also plays in parts for the observed 
increases in Vth.  
 Figure 5 shows the on-state 
impact-ionization-related gate current density 
(IG) for the studied devices biased at VDS = 1 V 
~ 2.5 V. The observed peak IG density (IG, peak) 
in the typical “bell-shaped” IG-VGS curves can 
provide a clear evidence for the 
impact-ionization-induced kink effects in the 
high-speed InGaAsSb channel. IG, peak values of 
samples A, B, and C biased at VDS = 2.5 V are 
-0.84 mA/mm, -0.75 mA/mm and -0.41 
mA/mm, respectively. Sample C has the lowest 
IG, peak, indicating its best suppression of kink 
effects. It is mainly due to the decreased n2DEG 
for initiating the impact ionization mechanism 
in the channel. Two possible causes are 
responsible the decreased n2DEG in sample C: (1) 
enhanced depletion by the high gate-barrier at a 
decreased gate-channel distance; (2) decreased 
gate leakages by the enhanced Schottky barrier 
height. Therefore, sample C with high ΦB 
(0.703 eV) has demonstrated the best relief in 
impact ionization phenomena as compared to 
samples A (0.514 eV) and B (0.603 eV). In 
addition, the kink effects can be identified by 
the output conductance (gd) in IDS-VDS 
  32
TABLE II  Comparisons of device characteristics 
among the studied MHEMTs as well as other studies 
where L/Z are the device gate length/width, Ri 
is the series resistance, and Ci/Cp are the 
intrinsic/parasitic capacitances. Sample C also 
demonstrates superior fT and fmax performances 
than other studies24-25 with similar gate lengths. 
Besides, the noise characteristics of the studied 
devices measured by using an HP8970B noise 
figure meter are shown in Fig. 9. The minimum 
noise figure (NFmin)/associated gain at 2.4 GHz 
of samples A, B, and C are 3.15/17.23, 2.6/19, 
and 1.93/21.11 dB, respectively. It is known 
that NFmin can be approximated29 to be 
inversely proportional to gm. Superior NFmin in 
sample C, as compared to samples A and B, is 
due to its enhanced gm characteristic. Table II 
concludes the comparison of the 
room-temperature device characteristics among 
the studied MHEMTs as well as with other 
studies23-25. 
 
 
It can be clearly observed that the 
room-temperature device performance can be 
comprehensively improved in sample C, after 
significantly suppressing the kink effects by the 
enhanced Schottky barriers of the Pt/InAlAsSb 
structure. Besides, the devised 
dual-composition-graded InGaAsSb channel 
and the wide-gap InAlAsSb barrier and buffer 
have demonstrated superior device 
characteristics as compared to other studies at 
similar gate dimensions and In compositions in 
the active layers.  
 Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the 
temperature-dependent gate-drain 
characteristics and the extracted BVGD/Von 
performances for samples A, B, and C, 
respectively, at 300-450 K. BVGD (Von) values 
of samples A/B/C at 300, 350, 400, and 450 K 
were determined to be -5.3 (0.71)/-9.7 
(0.87)/-15 (1.08), -4.4 (0.67)/-9.07 
(0.83)/-13.92 (1.04), -3.88 (0.63)/-8.63 
(0.8)/-12.45 (1.0), and -3.0 (0.59)/-5.91 
(0.72)/-11.7 (0.95), respectively. It is clear that 
sample C has still maintained the best 
gate-drain isolation capability at different 
temperatures. Besides, as the temperature is 
increased from 300 K to 450 K, sample C also 
exhibits the least variations in both BVGD/Von of 
-22%/-12%, as compared to -43.4%/-16.9% of 
sample A and -39.1%/-17.2% of sample B. ΦB 
values of samples A/B/C at 300, 350, 400, and 
450 K were also characterized to be 
0.514/0.603/0.703, 0.501/0.592/0.702, 
0.48/0.57/0.675, and 0.449/0.537/0.643 eV. 
Sample C has shown the highest ΦB values at 
high temperatures among the studied devices. 
Superior high-temperature gate-drain isolation 
of sample C, in terms of BVGD/Von, is possibly 
attributed to the high Schottky barrier of 
Pt/InAlAsSb through the following two 
mechanisms. First, the thermionic emission is 
  34
figure, high-frequency characteristics, power 
performance, and excellent thermal threshold 
stability as compared to other studies. Physical 
mechanisms for relieving kink effects to 
improve the device performance have 
systematically studied with theoretical insights 
and experimental verifications by comparing 
three different gate structures of Ni/InP, 
Ni/In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15, or Pt/ 
In0.34Al0.66As0.85Sb0.15 on the same epitaxial 
structure. The 2DEG concentration for 
initiating kink effects can be effectively 
decreased by the high Schottky barrier in three 
ways: (1) extended depletion region in the 
channel under the gate electrode; (2) effective 
decreases in gate leakages by the high barrier 
Schottky gate; (3) effective suppression of 
substrate leakages by the uses of high barrier 
InAlAsSb buffer. Consequently, after 
successful relief of the kink effects, the 
proposed Pt/InAlAsSb MHEMT (sample C) 
have demonstrated superior device 
performances, including gm, max = 349 (300) 
mS/mm at 300 (450) K, AV = 173.8, fT = 47.4 
GHz, fmax = 63.1 GHz, NFmin = 1.93 dB, Pout = 
17.3 dBm, GS = 19.92 dB, and P.A.E. = 46.5%. 
Superior thermal threshold stability of |dVth/dT| 
= 0.2 mV/K has been also achieved and 
investigated in details. The present MHEMT is 
promisingly suitable for high-temperature, 
high-power, and high-gain MMIC applications.

二、與會心得： 
2010 SOPO 為在亞洲舉行之光學與光電子元件等技術領域之知名國際研討會議，第
一篇論文很榮幸通過該會審稿委員認可，得以在近 450 篇論文中以 oral 方式於大會發
表，並引發熱烈的討論，會後並受到包含美國 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 教授與四
川大學教授主動晤談希望能進一步交流相關技術內容；另一 poster 論文亦在會場獲得許
多注目與學術交流，對於執行本國科會計畫之成果發表與我國學術研究聲譽增色許多，
本次國際研討之相關論文發表並將收錄於 IEEE Proceedings 之 EI 期刊。在此次研討會
中，個人除積極參與論文發表、參與論文討論之外，並與相關與會國際人士有許多學術
交流互動之機會，對於在光電子元件領域增廣許多專業見聞，期望日後能持續積極參與
類似之國際研討會議、發表具國際水準之論文，以期進一步增加國際學術交流經驗。 
 
 
三、建議： 
感謝國科會微電子學門研究計畫補助此次參加 2010 SOPO 國際性研討會議之機票
與生活費用、及逢甲大學資電學院給予補助大會註冊費用(USD 450)。此次有幸參與國
際研討會議之收穫，除了增加本身相關之專業知識及創新激勵，尤其學習、觀摩其它各
國不同研究領域學者對於光電子元件與整合技術之兢兢業業研發態度與投入，另國際研
討會會議過程給予個人拓展視野與感受。另有感於目前許多國際研討會註冊費用日趨昂
貴，以目前計畫補助參與亞太地區國際研討會之補助金額，參與人仍須申請校內補助或
自行補貼差額，雖然如此，個人仍期待能有機會於日後參與更多在北美或歐洲舉行之國
際研究會議，以與更多國際學者人士有進一步學術交流之機會。

Abstract—A three-terminal optical sensor by using an 
aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)-gated Al0.2Ga0.8As 
/In0.2Ga0.8As high electron mobility transistor (AZO-HEMT) 
on a GaAs substrate is demonstrated in this report. Optical 
responses under illumination of different wavelengths are 
investigated, as compared to a conventional Au-gated HEMT 
device. Experimental results demonstrate that the present 
design is promising for tunable optical sensing applications. 
Keywords: AZO, transparent gate, optical sensor 
I. INTRODUCTION  
Tremendous efforts on exploring new HEMT designs [1-2] 
based on different compound semiconductor materials have 
been made during the last few decades. The active channel 
usually consists of high-speed and direct-gap materials, which 
are capable of providing optical-coupling implementation. 
Therefore, some studies have investigated optical 
characteristics of different HEMT designs with opaque metal 
gates [3-4]. Besides, R. L. Hoffman et al [5] has lately 
demonstrated a ZnO-based transparent thin-film transistor 
(TFT). ZnO material with a wide band-gap of 3.37 eV at room 
temperature is attracting more attention to the optoelectronic 
systems. It is owing to its good optical, electrical, and 
piezo-electrical characteristics. ZnO, Al-doped zinc indium 
oxide (ZIO), or Sn-doped ZIO have mainly been used as the 
back- gate electrode materials of TFT’s [6-7], or used as the 
anode materials of the organic light-emitting diodes (OLED’s) 
[8]. This work demonstrates a transparent AZO-gated 
Al0.2Ga0.8As /In0.2Ga0.8As HEMT. Optical responses under 
illumination of different wavelengths are investigated, as 
compared to a conventional Au-gated HEMT device. 
II. MATERIAL GROWTH AND DEVICE FABRICATION 
Table I shows the epitaxial structures of the studied 
AZO-HEMT and an Au-gated HEMT (Au-HEMT).The layer 
structure consists of a 5000 Å thick GaAs buffer on a 
(100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate, followed by a 
500 Å Al0.22Ga0.78As buffer, a composite buffer comprising 
two periods of 500 Å Al0.22Ga0.78As/500 Å GaAs layers, a 
lower Si δ-doped (1 × 1012 cm-2) monolayer, a 50 Å 
Al0.2Ga0.8As spacer, a 150 Å In0.2Ga0.8As channel, a 50 Å 
Al0.2Ga0.8As spacer, an upper Si δ doped (4 × 1012 cm-2) 
monolayer, a gate-recessed 400 Å n-Al0.2Ga0.8As Schottky 
contact layer (3 × 1017 cm-3), and finally a 100 Å 
n+-In0.01Ga0.99As (3 × 1018 cm-3) capper. Standard 
photolithography and lift-off process were used in the device 
fabrication. Annealed AuGe/Au alloys were used as 
source/drain ohmic contacts. A 1100 Å thick, 2 wt% AZO 
gate electrode was formed upon the Al0.2Ga0.8As Schottky

and VDS = 3 V were 268 mA/mm and 295 mA/mm for the 
incident light source of 632 nm and 980 nm, respectively. Also, 
the corresponding Iph values were 48 mA/mm and 75 mA/mm. 
And the calculated optical responsivities were 0.24 W/A and 
0.75 A/W, respectively. Table II has compared the 
measurement results of the studied AZO-HEMT. As shown in 
Table II and Figs. 3(a)-(b), the studied AZO-HEMT have 
exhibited the best optical responsivity under illumination 
wavelength of 980 nm. It is due to that the 980 nm light can 
penetrate the Al0.2Ga0.8As layer with bandgap energy of 1.67 
eV to cause the electron excitation in the In0.2Ga0.8As channel. 
On the other hand, the 632 nm light were mainly absorbed by 
the Al0.2Ga0.8As layer. Besides, the fabricated AZO has shown 
higher transparency for incident light of 980 nm than that of 
632 nm. Consequently, higher photocurrent and higher 
responsivity of 980 nm light were observed than those of the 
632 nm illumination for the present AZO-HEMT.

IV.  CONCLUSION 
   In summary, three-terminal optical sensor formed by using 
an AZO-gated Al0.2Ga0.8As/In0.2Ga0.8As HEMT has been 
demonstrated. High transmittance characteristics of the AZO 
film can enable HEMT devices for optical sensing 
applications. The present AZO-HEMT has shown excellent 
tunable optical sensing performance as compared to a 
conventional Au-HEMT. Optical repsonses for incident light 
with white light, 632 nm, and 980 nm wavelengths were 
compared and investigated.
