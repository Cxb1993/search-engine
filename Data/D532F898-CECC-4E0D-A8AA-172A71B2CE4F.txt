Abstract 
Ferroelectric thin films of SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) or 
bilayered SrBi2Ta2O9/Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (SBT/BZT) are 
successfully deposited on Si substrate under the optimal 
RF magnetron sputtering conditions, and their electrical 
and ferroelectric characteristics are discussed. The 
memory window, capacitance and leakage current 
density of MFS structures under different oxygen 
concentrations are also reported. The memory window 
of bilayered SBT/BZT structure shows larger than one 
of single layer SBT structure. Besides, the bilayered 
SBT/BZT structure exhibits a ferroelectric behavior 
with a remanent polarization of 8 μC/cm2 and a 
coercive field of and 130 kV/cm. 
 
Introduction 
 Ferroelectric thin films have been extensively 
investigated for nonvolatile memory application, 
because ferroelectric random access memories 
(FeRAMs) have the characteristics of lower writing 
voltage, faster writing speed and better endurance [1]. 
Among ferroelectric materials, Pb(Zr,Ti)OB3B (PZT) is an 
important material for ferroelectric memory devices 
because of high remanent polarization and 
low-temperature crystallization, whereas it has few 
serious problems such as fatigue and Pb pollution 
[2]-[4]. For above mentioned reasons, SrBiB2BTaB2BOB9B-base 
thin films of Bi-layered ferroelectric have drawn much 
attention for nonvolatile random access memory 
(NVRAM) applications due to their fatigue endurance 
of up to 10P12 P switching cycles, good retention and lower 
leakage current [5]-[10]. However, the high processing 
temperature and low remanent polarization of SBT thin 
films are considerable problems for practical 
applications. Another, the perovskite ferroelectric 
Ba(Zr,Ti)OB3B (BZT) thin films have been candidates for 
DRAM devices use due to their ferroelectricity, high 
dielectric constant, high dielectric strength, low leakage 
current density, and low dielectric loss [11]-[13]. 
 For a metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor (MFS) 
structure, the unwanted silicon oxide layer and the 
interfacial layer can be formed between the ferroelectric 
thin film and substrate as the ferroelectric thin film is 
deposited on the semiconductor substrate. The 
ferroelectric properties of MFS structures, degraded by 
the low dielectric silicon oxide layer and interfacial 
layer, can be improved by inserting a high dielectric 
buffer layer [14]-[15]. Although the thin films of SBT 
and BZT have been widely researched, there is no 
report about the ferroelectric properties of bilayered 
SBT/BZT films on MFS structure yet. In this study, the 
SBT and BZT thin films deposited on Si substrates 
using RF magnetron sputtering will be presented. We 
also propose a novel bilayered structure, which 
combines SBT with BZT layer, by taking advantage of 
the superior electric properties of the SBT and BZT 
layer. The electrical properties of Al/SBT/BZT/Si MFS 
structures are investigated in comparison with those of 
Al/SBT/Si MFS ones. The ferroelectric properties of 
MFS are further improved using the bilayered 
SBT/BZT design. 
 
Experimental 
Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor (MFS) device 
structures, schematically shown in Fig. 1, were 
fabricated on a polished p-Si (100) wafer of nominal 
resistively ~1.0 Ωcm. The SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) thin films 
were deposited on Si substrates using the RF magnetron 
sputtering system. The target with composition of SBT 
ferroelectric properties of MFS might be degraded by 
the low dielectric silicon oxide layer. It is expected that 
the memory windows of Al/SBT/BZT/Si MFS structure 
increases as the BZT layer is inserted. The BZT layer 
with a high dielectric constant induces enhancement of 
the field applied to the SBT ferroelectric, and results in 
the increase of MFS memory window. 
The leakage current density versus applied voltage 
(J-V) curves of MFS structures are shown in Fig. 6. As 
0 MV/cm is applied on MFS structures, the leakage 
current densities are lower than 5×10-9 A/cm2, which 
are very small. The leakage current densities increase 
critically as the applied field increases from 0 to 0.2 
MV/cm and gradually increase as the applied field 
increases from 0.2 to 0.5 MV/cm. The leakage current 
density is 9.7×10-9 A/cm2 for the Al/SBT/Si MFS 
structure and 1.4×10-7 A/cm2 for the Al/SBT/BZT/Si 
one at a field strength of 0.5 MV/cm, respectively. The 
sources of leakage current result from oxygen vacancies 
and interface traps. The increase of interface traps and 
roughness by adding the BZT film causes that the 
bilayered SBT/BZT MFS structure has higher leakage 
current. 
The polarizations versus applied electrical field 
(P-E) curves of Al/SBT/BZT/Pt/Si structure at the 
frequency of 100 kHz are shown in Fig. 7. From the 
P-E curves, the remanent polarization apparently 
increases with the increase of applied voltage. 
Additionally, the 2Pr and coercive field are also 
calculated, and they are around 8 μC/cm2 and 130 
kV/cm. These results suggest tat the novel structure of 
bilayered SBT/BZT film has the general polarization 
characteristics and can be used to fabricate the FeRAM 
devices. 
 
Conclusion 
The SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) and Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (BZT) 
thin films are successfully deposited on Si substrate 
using the RF magnetron sputtering technology. A novel 
bilayered SBT/BZT structure is also investigated in the 
study. The electrical properties of single layer SBT 
structures are affected by different oxygen 
concentration. The experiment result shows that the 
optimal atmosphere for depositing the SBT thin films is 
the 40 % oxygen concentration. When the 40% oxygen 
concentration is used to deposit SBT thin films, the 
maximum memory window and the minimal leakage 
current density of Al/SBT/Si (MFS) structure is 23 V 
and 2.2×10-8A/cm2, respectively. For the 
Al/SBT/BZT/Si MFS structure, the addition of BZT 
film will bring about the increase of the interface traps 
and the higher leakage current. Nevertheless, the 
bilayered SBT/BZT structure enhances the applied field 
of SBT ferroelectric film and results in the increase of 
the memory window. The result indicates that the 
bilayered SBT/BZT thin film is a promising 
combination for ferroelectric memory application.
