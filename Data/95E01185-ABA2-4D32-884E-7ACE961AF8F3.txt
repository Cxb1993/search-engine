2000 就是以小波轉換為發展基礎。目前較
具代表性的小波轉換編碼技術有： set

Abstract
For images with textures, the high
frequency wavelet coefficients are likely to
become significant after a few passes of the
set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT)
algorithm, which substantially degrades the
coding performance. A hybrid image coder
using SPIHT and embedded block coding
(EBC) is thus proposed. In which, the low
frequency wavelet coefficients are coded by
SPIHT, on the other hand, the high frequency
wavelet coefficients representing the high
details of an image are coded by EBC. The
intermediate coding results of SPIHT can be
used as estimates to facilitate the coding
operations of EBC, which takes both of the
well defined hierarchical tree structure across
wavelet subbands and energy clustering
within each subband into account to improve
the compression performance. Experimental
results show that the coding performance can
be significantly improved by using the
proposed hybrid SPIHT-EBC algorithm.

I. Introduction
Wavelet transform provides numerous
desirable properties, such as efficient
multi-resolution representation, scalability,
and embedded coding with progressive
transmission, which are beneficial to the
image compression applications [1]. Wavelet
based multi-resolution representation
matches the Human Visual System,
specifically the higher detail information of
an image is represented by the shorter basis
function with higher spatial resolution and
the lower detail information is represented by
the larger basis function with higher spectral
resolution [2]. The recently standardized
image compression scheme known as JPEG
2000 uses discrete wavelet transform as the
underlying transform algorithm [3].
After wavelet transform, the original
image is decomposed into subbands with
4II.1 Review of SPIHT
After wavelet transform, an image is
decomposed into subbands with orientation
selectivity. The related wavelet coefficients
taken from all the subbands of the same
orientation can be grouped to form
hierarchical trees, where the tree hierarchy is
based on the resolution level. The root node
of a tree is a coefficient at the coarsest
resolution, and the leaf nodes are coefficients
at the finest resolution. Every non-leaf node
can be a parent node, which has four children
nodes at the next finer resolution. For
example, Figure 1(b) shows a tree of wavelet
coefficients in the diagonal orientation. For
images with most of the energies
concentrated in the low frequency subbands,
if a parent node is insignificant with respect
to a given threshold, all the descendant nodes
(at the finer resolution levels) are likely to be
insignificant with respect to the same
threshold, and therefore this tree of
insignificant nodes called zero-tree can be
efficiently coded. The above-mentioned
property known as the self-similarity of
wavelet transform motivates zero-tree coding
in wavelet domain [4]-[5].
In the SPIHT algorithm, three symbols,
namely zero-tree (ZT), insignificant pixel (IP)
and significant pixel (SP) are used to code
the wavelet coefficients of an image, which
are stored in the list of insignificant sets
(LIS), list of insignificant pixels (LIP) and
list of significant pixels (LSP), respectively.
The SPIHT algorithm is as follows.
1) Initialization: Set the initial
threshold bT 2 , where   nmcb ,2 maxlog ,
and nmc , is the transform coefficient at
position ),( nm .
2) Sorting pass: Identify the significant
coefficients with TcT nm 2,  and
output their respective sign bits.
3) Refinement pass: For coefficients
with Tc nm 2,  , output the
thb bit.
4) Decrease b by one, divide the threshold
value by 2, and go to step 2.
The scan pass, i.e. the sorting pass
followed by the refinement pass is repeatedly
performed until the desired bit rate is reached.
In the sorting pass, if an insignificant
coefficient stored in LIP becomes significant,
it is removed to LSP and the sign bit is
encoded; otherwise, it remains in LIP. For a
tree of insignificant coefficients with the root
stored in LIS, if none of the descendent
coefficients becomes significant, the root
remains in LIS; otherwise, it becomes a
broken tree and a further decomposition takes
place to locate the significant coefficients. In
the refinement pass, every significant
coefficient that has been identified in the
previous sorting passes and stored in LSP is
refined by updating the magnitude
information.
II.2 Review of EBC
The main idea behind embedded block
coding (EBC) is to make use of the energy
clustering property of wavelet transform. The
embedded block coding with optimized
truncation (EBCOT) algorithm, which has
been adopted by JPEG 2000, is a two-tier
algorithm. Tier-1 performs bit-plane coding
(BPC) followed by arithmetic coding. Tier-2
performs rate distortion optimization [10].
The coding passes of EBCOT, namely the
significance propagation pass, the magnitude
refinement pass, and the cleanup pass are
performed in BPC with four primitive coding
operations: the significance coding operation,
the sign coding operation, the magnitude
refinement coding operation, and the cleanup
coding operation. For each insignificant
coefficient, if none of the 8-neighbor
coefficients has become significant, it is
coded by the cleanup coding operation in the
cleanup pass; otherwise, it is coded by the
significance coding operation in the
significance propagation pass. If an
insignificant coefficient becomes significant,
the sign bit is then coded by the sign coding
operation. For each significant coefficient
that has been identified in the previous
coding passes, the magnitude information is
updated by the magnitude refinement coding
operation in the magnitude refinement pass.
The output bit-streams of BPC can be further
compressed by arithmetic coding. The
6addition, the significant high frequency
wavelet coefficients of an image are likely to
be clustered. Thus, a context-based
embedded block coding (EBC) strategy is
suitable for coding the highest frequency
wavelet coefficients. Figure 3 depicts the
proposed algorithm using SPIHT and EBC to
code the low frequency and the highest
frequency wavelet coefficients, respectively.
The detail of the hybrid SPIHT-EBC
algorithm is as follows.
III.2 Hybrid SPIHT-EBC Algorithm
1) Initialization: Decompose the original
image into wavelet subbands. Quantize the
transform coefficients with a given step-size
to form the bit-plane representation so that
the image is coded bit-plane by bit-plane,
from most to least significant.
2) Sorting pass for the upper tree levels: As
tree nodes at the upper levels are wavelet
coefficients in the lower frequency subbands,
which represent the homogeneous regions of
an image, the sorting pass of SPIHT is
therefore adopted to code these tree nodes.
3) Significance propagation pass for the leaf
nodes: By comparison with the sorting pass
of SPIHT, it is noted that the significance
propagation pass of EBCOT is preferable for
locating the significant leaf nodes, which are
the highest frequency wavelet coefficients
representing the high-detail textures of an
image. Thus, for a leaf node that is
insignificant at the moment, if its parent node
is significant and at least one of the 8
neighboring nodes is also significant, this
leaf node is coded in this pass; otherwise, it
will be coded in the later pass called cleanup
pass.
4) Magnitude refinement pass: The
significant nodes that have been found in the
previous coding passes are refined with one
bit per node.
5) Cleanup pass for the leaf nodes: For the
insignificant leaf nodes that have not been
coded in the previous significance
propagation pass, examine and code these
nodes using the context-based cleanup
coding operation of EBCOT. In addition, if
the parent node (at the next upper level) and
the 12 neighboring leaf nodes (shown in
Figure 4) are all insignificant, then the 4 leaf
nodes are coded by a single run-length
coding with or without the uniform coding
operation of EBCOT.
6) Go to step 2, and code the next less
significant bit-plane.
The proposed hybrid coding algorithm is
performed in the framework of SPIHT so that
the advantage of the pyramid structure of
wavelet transform can be taken into account.
As energies of the low frequency components
of an image are likely to decrease from low
to high frequency subbands, wavelet nodes at
the upper tree levels can be efficiently coded
by using SPIHT. On the other hand, as the
significant wavelet coefficients in the highest
frequency subbands are likely to be clustered,
the leaf nodes are thus coded by using the
significance propagation pass and cleanup
pass of EBCOT instead of the sorting pass of
SPIHT. The sequence of coding passes from
step 2 to step 5 is repeatedly performed until
a given bit rate (or the reconstructed image
quality) is reached. In the sorting pass, if all
the descendant nodes of a zero-tree are still
insignificant, excluding the leaf nodes that
are to be coded in either the significance
propagation pass or the cleanup pass, they
remain a group of insignificant nodes and
therefore can be efficiently coded by using a
single symbol, ZT. Note that the output of
coding step 2 has been used as an estimate of
significance to facilitate the following coding
step such that the significant nodes can be
coded as early as possible. For each
insignificant node, if it becomes significant,
its sign bit is immediately coded. The
resulting code stream of the proposed
SPIHT-EBC algorithm is still embedded and
progressive, and moreover, it can be
implemented in quad-tree parallel.
IV. Experimental Results

algorithm has been evaluated on several
