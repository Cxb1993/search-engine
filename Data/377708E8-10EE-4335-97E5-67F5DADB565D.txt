with varying speeds. Hashemi et al. [10] 
proposed a new dynamic finite element for 
vibrations problem of spinning beam. Banerjee 
[11] applied the dynamic stiffness method to 
analyze the free vibration of a uniform and 
tapered straight beam. Besides the 
above-mentioned analysis by using various 
approximate methods, Storti and Aboelnaga [12] 
found the exact solution for the bending 
vibrations of a class of rotating non-uniform 
beams. Lee and Kuo [13, 14] utilized 
polynomial expansion to obtain the exact 
solution for the bending vibration of a rotating 
non-uniform beam. Lee and Lin [15] 
numerically studied the coupling effect of the 
rotating speed and the mass moment of inertia 
on the natural frequencies and the phenomenon 
of divergence instability. Lin et al. [16] 
obtained the semi-analytical steady state 
solution of rotating damped beams, in which 
the influence of viscous damping on the natural 
frequency was investigated. Further, Lin et al. 
[4] investigated the dynamic response of a 
rotating damped beam with arbitrary pretwist. 
However, these papers investigated were 
confined to the studies on the vibration 
problems of a straight beam. 
For increasing the performance of a fan, 
In general, a forward or backward curved 
blade was designed [17]. So far, little research 
has been done about the vibration problems of 
a rotating curved beam because of its 
complexity. The approximation methods are 
popularly used to investigate this system. 
Wang and Mahrenholtz [18] studied the 
dynamic behavior of the rotating curved beam 
by using the Galerkin method. They used the 
Legendre polynomials to represent the shape 
functions and discussed the effect of the hub 
radius, the cross-section orientation and the 
curvature at various rotating speeds. However, 
the root stiffness was not considered. Park and 
Kim [19] studied the dynamic analysis of a 
rotating curved beam with a tip mass by using 
the finite element method. The effects of the 
hub radius and the root stiffness were not 
taken into account. In fact, the effect of the 
root stiffness of a rotating curved beam 
should be significant.  
Based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, 
using Hamilton’s principle derives two 
governing differential equations for the 
coupled bending-extensional vibration of a 
rotating curved beam with an elastically 
restrained root. The effects of the root 
stiffness as well as the hub radius are taken 
into consideration. The explicit relations 
between the radial and axial displacement 
variables are constructed. The closed-form 
solution of this system is derived. Finally, the 
influences of the root stiffness, the hub radius 
and the rotating speed on the natural 
frequencies and the instability are 
investigated. 
2.  Derivation of Motion Equations 
Consider a rotating curved beam with an 
elastically restrained root. The beam is 
mounted on a hub with radius hr  and rotates 
with constant angular speed Ω, as shown in 
Figure 1. The Euler-Bernoulli theory is 
considered. The radial cross section which is 
originally a plane remains plane after bending 
and axial deformation. The beam is 
homogeneous and isotropic. The beam is 
slender and the thickness (in the plane of

As a result, the natural frequencies of the 
rotating curved beam with an elastically 
restrained root can be obtained from the 
following frequency equation 
0ijB = .  (25) 
6. Verification and discussion 
 
To demonstrate the accuracy and 
efficiency of the proposed method, a examples 
is illustrated for verification. The fundamental 
natural frequencies are taken comparison with 
those determined by the finite element method 
[19] at the same conditions. It illustrates from 
Figure 2 that these results are in a good 
agreement. 
The influences of the translational spring 
constant vβ on the fundamental natural 
frequency Λ1 is investigated and shown in 
Figures (3-5). The rotational displacement at 
the root is not allowed, i.e., θβ →∞ . If vβ  is 
finite, the translational displacement at the root 
is allowed. The translational spring constant vβ  
in Figures (3-5) are chosen as ‘∞ ’, 1000’, and 
‘100’, respectively. It is found that the 
influence of vβ on Λ1 is significant.  Figure 
(3a) shows that if the rotating speed α is 
increased, the fundamental natural frequency of 
the cantilever beam with the arc angle of 900 
decreases. If the rotating speed α is increased 
to a critical value, the fundamental natural 
frequency becomes zero. In other words, the 
divergent instability occurs. Figure (3b) shows 
the influence of the hub radius on the 
fundamental natural frequency. It is seen that 
although the arc angle is increased to the value 
of 900, the fundamental natural frequency of a 
cantilever increases with the rotating speed α. 
When the translational spring constant vβ  is 
decreased to the value of 1000, as shown in 
Figure 4, the fundamental natural frequencies 
are decreased significantly. The divergent 
instability does not happen to the beam with 
1µ = , as shown in Figure 4b. However, when 
the translational spring constant vβ  is 
decreased to the value of 100, as shown in 
Figure 5, the divergent instability happens to 
the beam with 1µ = , as shown in Figure 5c. It 
is concluded that if the translational spring 
constant vβ  is decreased, the natural 
frequencies are decreased significantly. When 
the translational spring constant vβ  is small 
enough, although the hub radius is large, the 
divergent instability will occur.
