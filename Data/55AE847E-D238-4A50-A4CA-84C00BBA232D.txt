smoother and better quality surface without leaving 
circumferential textured patterns on the surface. We 
have developed a NiP/aluminum substrate mechanical 
texturing process, E process, using a fine texturing 
tape with a fiber size of 0.35μm and small nano-
cluster diamond (NCD) abrasive particles with a size 
of 12nm. The E process produces a lower surface 
roughness Ra (from 0.21nm to 0.06nm) and results in 
the lowest glide avalanche (from 6.35nm to 2.54nm). 
These results indicate that a better quality media 
with low-defectivity can be obtained using the new 
developed mechanical texturing process. This process 
generates a very smooth surface with few textured 
scratches and adequate textured removal amount. A 
smoother substrate with a lower Ra leads to a 
narrower dispersion of rocking angle, Δθ50 of 
Co(0001), and half width of transition, TW50, and 
therefore resulting in improvements of OW and SNR.

implementing a mechanical texturing process 
to eliminate substrate surface asperities and 
residual surface defects and also reduce the 
surface roughness in a PMR disk [4]. 
A mechanical texture process originally was 
used to create deep circumferential grooves 
and lines on AlMg/NiP substrate surfaces in 
longitudinal magnetic recording (LMR) media. 
It is well known that this mechanical texturing 
in LMR media induces a magnetic anisotropy 
along the circumferential direction. The 
induced magnetic anisotropy in LMR makes 
majority of magnetic moments lie along 
circumferential direction which enhance 
magnetic properties like remanant 
magnetization (Mr), coercivity (Hc) and 
coercive squareness (S*), leading to a SNR 
improvement. Unlike LMR media, magnetic 
moments in PMR are perpendicular to 
substrate surface through a crystalline 
anisotropy of Co<0001> normal to substrate 
surface induced by an epitaxial system of 
NiW(100)// Ru(0001)//Co(0001). Therefore, 
many engineers and researchers in HDD 
industry do not think a mechanical texturing 
process is needed for PMR media. 
Mechanical texturing process is a double 
sword to PMR media performance. One hand, 
a smooth substrate surface can potentially help 
in magnetic film growth in the direction of 
Co<0001> during sputter deposition which 
promotes magnetic properties like remanant 
magnetization (Mr), coercity (Hc) and 
coercive squareness (S*). On the other hand, a 
rough substrate surface can possibly disperse 
film growth in 
NiW<111>//Ru<0001>//Co<0001> direction 
which degrades the magnetic properties 
[4]-[6]. 
In this paper, we have studied mechanical 
texturing effects on PMR media including 
surface roughness, textured removal amount, 
texture scratches, glide avalanche, defects and 
magnetic performance. We demonstrate a new 
mechanical texturing process for PMR media 
which can generate smooth surfaces without 
clear circumferential texture patterns (grooves) 
on the substrate surfaces using a fine texturing 
tape and small diamond abrasive particles. 
This process reduces defect counts, lower fly 
height of a read/read head, and leads to 
improvements of OW and SNR. 
三、實驗步驟 
In the experiment, four texturing processes 
were developed using two types of tape made 
from Nylon-based material with different fiber 
sizes – 0.7 μm and 0.35 μm (as shown in Fig. 
1),  two different sizes of nano-cluster 
diamond (NCD) abrasive particles - 24nm and 
12nm, along with a suitable coolant which can 
completely dissolve the NCD abrasive 
particles. Figures 2a and 2b are TEM photos 
of the two different NCD abrasive particles. It 
appears that the NCD abrasive particles are 
made up of a myriad of smaller crystallites. 
Texturing force utilized in this process was 2 
pounds with an oscillation frequency of 5.6 
HZ. An optimal rotation speed of 734 rpm in 
the texturing process was found to be a key 
parameter in obtaining a low roughness (Ra) 
of substrate surface. 
To study texturing effects on surface 
roughness (Ra and Rp), textured removal 
amount, and surface scratches, we made four 
media A, B, C, D, and E using NiP/aluminum 
substrates which were textured with different 
processes. Media A was the disk used an 
as-received NiP/aluminum substrate. Media B 
was textured with a coarse fiber tap and large 
 4
more fibers on the surface and thus more 
contact points during the texturing process 
than a coarse fiber tape while coarse fiber tape 
has longer penetration depth than a fine fiber 
tape. Therefore, both the coarse and fine fiber 
tapes end up with a similar texture removal 
amount. 
Compared media E with media A, Ra of 
media E is reduced from 0.21nm to 0.06 nm 
and its Rp is reduced from 1.59 nm to 0.35 nm. 
Fig.4 shows AFM images of media A and E, 
showing a significant reduction of surface 
roughness after an as-received NiP/aluminum 
substrate is textured using a fine fiber tape and 
small abrasive particles. 
In summary, surface roughness and surface 
scratch counts of a NiP/aluminum substrate 
decrease as the fiber size of a texture tape and 
the size of NCD abrasive particles get smaller. 
Because a fine fiber tape is softer, the 
combination of a fine fiber tape with small 
NCD abrasive particles has a short penetration 
depth, resulting in a smoother substrate 
surface with fewer scratches. All of the four 
texture processes have similar textured 
removal amounts although their surface 
roughness and scratch counts are different. 
This because textured removal amount is 
determined by both penetration depth and 
fiber number and touching points in a unit 
texturing contacting area. 
 
Medias Glide, Defect and Magnetic 
Performance 
Low surface roughness of as-received 
NiP/aluminum substrates after texturing 
process results in a low glide avalanche 
between head and media interface. Fig. 5 
shows that a glide avalanche is a function of 
Rp and Ra values. The R squared values are 
0.96 and 0.99 for Rp and Ra, respectively, 
indicating that the glide avalanches of media 
A to E are correlated with their Ra and Rp 
values very well in this study. 
Fig. 6a shows a defect failure mode called 
Media Surface 2 Bits, which is an asperity 
with dimension of 0.2 nm height with ~1μm 
length and width (covering 2 bits at 480 kfci) 
measured by an AFM. This type of defects 
comes from a NiP/aluminum substrate 
subsurface as shown in TEM images (Fig. 6b 
and 6c). Basically, the substrate surface 
defects can be removed or reduced with the 
texturing process with an increased textured 
removal amount. As shown in Table 1, both 
substrate surface defects and textured 
scratches decrease as textured removal 
amount increases. This data indicate that the 
media E has the lowest defect level because 
the texturing process removes enough surface 
material to eliminate its Media Surface 2 Bits 
defects while generating very few surface 
scratch defects. 
A smooth surface produced by a texturing 
process can help film growth along a desirable 
direction during sputtering. In a perpendicular 
magnetic media, Co(0001), Ru (0001), NiW 
(111) planes are parallel to the substrate 
surface because of an epitaxial system of 
NiW(111)//Ru(0001)//Co(0001). Magnetic 
film quality is determined by dispersion of 
Co-alloy basal planes, (0001). The smaller 
dispersion of Co (0001) is the better film 
quality. Δθ50 of Co(0001), dispersion of 
Co(0001) planes,  is measured using a 
rocking curve analysis. 
In a perpendicular recording system, TW50 
is the transition width of an isolated pulse at 
50% of the read-back signal amplitude, which 
is determined by the head field gradient. As a
