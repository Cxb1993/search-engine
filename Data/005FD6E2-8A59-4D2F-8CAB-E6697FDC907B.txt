The supercritical flow always takes place at grass ditch in the upstream of rivers in Taiwan due to their 
steep slopes. Because of the complicated river flow phenomena in upstream, the advanced air entrainment and 
infiltration analysis should be taken into consideration for the planning of grass ditch confinement by 
employing ecological engineering methods. At present, some 1-dimensional steady flow models are usually 
employed to calculate the water stage for the supercritical flow in the grass ditch. However, the simulated 
results from these 1-dimensional steady flow models can not response the characteristics of the complicated 
supercritical flow with air entrainment and infiltration, such as infiltration discharge and water stage 
increasing caused by the contraction of river section, or the oblique shock wave. A numerical hydraulic 
analysis model will be developed by employing the simulated results of air entrainment supercritical flow

 INTRODUCTION 
The supercritical flow always takes place at grass ditch in the upstream of rivers in Taiwan due to their steep 
slopes. Because of the complicated river flow phenomena in steep rivers, the advanced air entrainment and hydraulic 
analysis should be taken into consideration for the planning of grass ditch confinement by employing ecological 
engineering methods. At present, some 1-dimensional steady flow models are usually employed to calculate the 
water stage for the supercritical flow in the grass ditch. However, the simulated results from the one-dimensional 
steady model can not response the characteristics of the complicated supercritical flow with air entrainment, such as 
water stage increasing caused by the contraction of river section, or the oblique shock wave. A numerical hydraulic 
analysis model will be developed by employing the simulated results of air entrainment supercritical flow model. The 
results of this research can be used for determining design stages of grass ditch confinement for supercritical flow 
with air entrainment in Taiwan.

turbulent fluctuation of that quantity with respect to its mean value.  For a compressible fluid, ρ  may vary 
from point to point, and as a result of convection, from instant to instant at any point, but the density of an 
infinitesimal compressible element remains constant with time. The one-dimensional open-channel flow 
continuity equation is derived through integration of Equation (1) over the flow cross section (Yen, 1973).

Allowing for 0=aC , Equation (6) can easily describe the conservation of mass for the flow without air 
entrainment. 
Since hydraulic jump involves the highly turbulent flow and two-phase flow due to air entrainment, its flow is 
characterized by a large amount of  “white waters” caused by air entrainment. Let aC  responds to the ratio 
of air volume to volume of both air and water mixture. Rajaratnam (1961) measured the distribution of air 
concentration in jumps with the Froude number from 2.42 to 8.72. The measured data of air concentration aC  
shows large superficially near the toe, and decreases towards the end of the jump. Beyond the end of the jump 
there are still small air bubbles in the flow, as may also be observed visually. Apart from the air concentration, 
the air entrainment can also be given by the Equation (7).

where h  represents the effective water depth, i.e. the density in h  is equal to the water density wρ . The 
symbol, h , is the depth of white water. As regards air entrainment, the white water density ρ  is less than the 
water density. However, if there is no bubble in the flow, the effective water depth h  should be equal to the 
white water depth h . The relationship among the effective water depth, h , the white water depth, h , and 
the air concentration, aC , can be expressed as follows

The variation with respect to the flow direction, x , of the internal normal stresses acting on the cross section, 
xT ∂∂ , is not negligible when it rapidly changes in flow cross section, such as the hydraulic jump, for 
instance. In general, the influence of the turbulent stresses to the flow is greater than that of the molecular 
viscous force and the Equation (15) can be rewritten by combing the Equation (9) and neglecting the molecular 
viscosity term, i.e. 
∫−−= hwa dhuuCT )()1(  '1 '1ρ  （17） 
Since the boundary layer has expanded over the entire flow depth in the hydraulic jump and the surface roller 
also causes the air entrainment; the turbulence phenomena must be considered in the simulation of the 
hydraulic jump flow. Base on the assumption that (1) turbulence is negligible at the toe of hydraulic jump, (2) 
hydrostatic pressure exists all over the hydraulic jump, and (3) both the viscous and the turbulent stresses are 
negligible over the free surface, the regression result of the experiment data (Kalis, 1961) is employed as well 
to evaluate the turbulence intensity of Equation (16). As regards the decrease of the turbulence intensity,

In this study, the friction between flowing water and the bed is described by Manning’s formula under the

ditches. The resistance equations developed by Freeman et al. (2000) for submerged and partially submerged 
vegetation are adopted and used to modify the model. Liu et al. (2003) employed this technique to model 
vegetation in the mangrove wetland. The Manning’s friction coefficient is related to hydraulic and vegetation

MODEL VERIFICATION   
Since the air entrainment characteristics of hydraulic jump are very complicate, the experimental data of Hager 
(1990) and Rajaratnam (1961) is employed to demonstrate the validity of the numerical model. The root of the 
square relative error, 2L , is used to show the accuracy of the numerical model and defined as follows

(1) Hager’s experiment (1990) 
A numerical simulation of the hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel designed by Hager (1990) was performed.  The channel has the 
Manning roughness coefficient of n = 0.01, and the channel width is 2.5 m. The water enters with flow depth of 0.043 m, velocity 2.79 m/s, 
and the Froude number Fr = 4.3.   The measured flow depth and two simulated ones, with and without air entrainment, are all shown 
in Figure 2. The simulated flow depth with air entrainment is in good agreement with the experimental results given by Hager (1990).  
Figure 2 shows that the hydraulic jump location is at =x 1.2 m, while the length of the hydraulic jump is 1.4 m. In generally, the water 
depth at the downstream of the hydraulic jump can be calculated with the principal of force balance by neglecting the air entrainment:

2 −+= Fhh  (35) 
Compared with the measured data 0.261 m, the water depth, which is calculated from Equation (35), is 0.235 m within the error of 12.6%. 
The simulated results achieve mesh-independence when the gird is finer than 100. Figure 2 shows that both of the simulated length and the 
flow depth of hydraulic jump with air entrainment is more closed to the measured data than the simulated results with air entrainment. The 
comparisons of 2L  for different numerical models are shown in the first column of Table 1. It is obvious that the numerical model with 
air entrainment is producing accurate results. 
The Froude number and specific energy obtained from the numerical simulations are compared to each other in Figure 3. The specific 
energy, E , is the total energy head above the channel bed and is defined as 
E h Vg= +

 （36）
 
Figure 3 shows that the model without air entrainment causes a large energy loss quite near the hydraulic jump location simulated results 
of the model without, while the model with air entrainment can reasonably simulate the energy loss by employing the Equation (19) to 
calculate the turbulent force accurately. The simulated air concentration is show in Figure 4. The maximum air concentration is 0.36 at =x  1.3 m and decreased to 0 at ≥x  2.6m.  
 
(2) Rajaratnam’s experiment (1961) 
A numerical simulation of the hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel designed and experimented by Raharanam (1961) was also 
performed.  The channel has the Manning roughness coefficient of n = 0.012, and the channel width is 2.0 m. The water enters with flow 
depth of 0.036 m, velocity 3.77 m/s, and the Froude number Fr = 6.3.   The measured and simulated results of air concentration are 
both shown in Figure 5. The simulated air concentration is in good agreement with the experimental results given by Raharanam (1961).  
Figure 6 shows that the hydraulic jump location is at =x 2.2 m and the length of the hydraulic jump is 2.3 m.  
The simulated results achieve mesh-independence when the gird is finer than 250. The comparison of 2L  in numerical models is shown 
in the second column of Table 1. It is obvious that the numerical model with air entrainment is producing accurate results. 
According to the comparison with the experimental data of Rajaratnam (1961) and Hager (1990), the numerical model developed in this 
paper, can reasonably simulate the hydraulic jump. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper describes two numerical models, one with air entrainment and infiltration and the other without them, by which to solve the 
one-dimensional shallow-water equations for supercritical flow in grass ditchs.  Both models employ the high-resolution finite-difference 
scheme that is efficient for discontinuous regions such as hydraulic jump and rapidly varied flow conditions. The computed results show 
that the model with air entrainment is generally in reasonable agreement with the measured data, and more accurate than the one without
