中文摘要 
在競爭激烈的零售業中，要將種類繁多的產品陳列在有限的貨架空間上，對賣場管理者
而言是一件十分重要且繁重的工作。不同的產品組合和貨架擺列方式，會直接影響到消費者
的目光、注意力、及購買時的決策，當然也就顯著地影響到零售商的獲利。因此，如何將產
品項目分配到有限的貨架空間(貨架指派)，就成為零售業中一個非常重要的問题。在過去的
研究中，許多的研究多利用 space elasticity (空間彈性)的考量以達到產品規劃及空間配置的最
佳化，卻未能考量商品經常被同時購買及顧客購物之行經路徑的因素。雖然近來也有學者利
用商品關聯性或是消費路徑的資訊做為改善、規畫商品的貨架指派，然而這些研究並未能同
時考量商品關聯性與消費路徑，且未能有效地提供一個明確且具體的方法解決商品貨架指派
的問題。因此，本計畫提出一個「以顧客瀏覽樣式與採購關聯性為基礎之貨架指派研究」，針
對以 RFID 為基礎之賣場，深入探討顧客採購商品關聯性、瀏覽路徑行為模式、與貨架擺放

一、緣由與目的 
In the retailing business, merchandisers heavily rely on marketing stimuli to increase their 
sales volume. The factors in marketing stimuli and retail mix include store location, product 
assortment, pricing, advertising and promotion, layout, display, and services. Among that, 
product-to-shelf assignment is one of most important issues in a store. Marketing researches show 
product-to-shelf assignment strategy dramatically affects customers’ purchasing decision and profit 
for a retailing store.  
Recently, the progress of information technology makes retailers easily collect daily 
transaction data. With the novel information technology, retailers can solidify ephemeral 
relationships with customers into long-term and fruitful relationships if they can discover customer 
behavior from collected data. Data mining is one of the most popular technologies that can discover 
potential customer knowledge from business databases to assist a policy decision. The technology 
can automatically or semi-automatically analyze large amounts of data in a business database and is 
capable of detecting potential significant patterns and rules underlying the data. These patterns and 
rules can predict and represent the behavior of consumer purchases or other consumer habits.  
In the previous studies, researchers usually applied the space elasticity to optimize product 
assortment and space allocation models. The space elasticity is used to construct the relationship 
between shelf space and product demand. One of the earliest optimization models was developed by 
Hansen and Heinsbroek (1979). They estimated the demand of products by space elasticity and 
constructed optimization models to select and allocate products. However, the aforementioned 
works are developed to resolve the product assortment and the shelf size determination problems by 
taking space elasticity into consideration. They didn’t consider the factor of the frequent purchased 
product relationship when conducting product-to-shelf assignment task.  
Actually, it has been proofed that if items frequently purchased together are displayed at 
nearby shelves, the cross-selling opportunity dramatically increases (Agrawal, 1994; Park et al., 
1997; Han et al., 2000). Based on this idea, association rules mining, one of the most popular data 
mining technologies, is developed and applied to discover purchased associations between distinct 
products in a store. Apriori (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994), FP-Growth (Han et al., 2004) and Ecalt 
(Zaki, 2001) are some popular algorithms for explore item associations. Although these algorithms 
are efficient in dealing with large number of datasets, they do not discuss how to apply the 
association information to conduct product-to-shelf assignment. As the best we know, only one 
research reported by Chen and Lin (2007) mentioned the details of using the purchasing relationship 
between products (or product categories) to resolve product-to-shelf assignment. In their study, 
association mining is used to obtain products frequently bought by customers in the levels of 
itemsets, categories sets, and categories sets. Information of frequent itemsets are then used for 
product assortment decision task with the objective function of maximizing total profit of selected 
products in the store under the constraint of available shelf space. However, their method is suitable 
for constructing a new store, instead reallocating products in a exist store. For an existing store, the 
frequent purchase pattern may not maintain if all products are reassigned to new shelves by their 
method.  
6 
1996), SPADE (Zaki, 2001), GO-SPADE (Leleu et al., 2003) and SPAM (Ayres et al., 2002) are 
common methods.  Some researchers asserted different algorithms to improve the performance of 
sequential patterns mining because Aprioir-based methods may generate too many candidates and 
need to scan database much times. FreeSpan (Han et al., 2000) and PrefixSpan (Pei et al., 2001) are 
famous algorithms.  
Some researches applied sequential patterns mining technique to find navigation behaviors in 
the web environment. Chen et al. (1996) proposed the concept of using the maximal forward 
references to break down users’ sessions into transactions for mining access patterns. Cooley et al. 
(1999) provided a query language on top of external mining software for association rules and for 
sequential patterns. Pei et al., (2000) developed a prefix –tree-based data structure, called WAP-tree 
(Web access pattern tree), to maintain the frequent Web click-sequences from Web logs, and 
proposed a two-pass patterns growth algorithm WAP-mine to discover the set of Web access 
patterns. Xing and Shen (2004) introduced the concept of preference that consists of selection 
preference and time preference for more accurate measurement of user navigation behaviors.  
Inspired by above works, some researchers start to modify those algorithms used in web 
environment and apply them to discover path traversal patterns in a RFID deployed 
supermarket/store. Larson et al. (2005) and Liao and Lin (2007) provided novel methods to capture 
shopping path in a supermarket with RFID deployment. Besides, there are some researches focused 
on applying sequential patterns mining technique to find navigation behaviors in web environment. 
Web managers or supermarket managers usually not only want to know navigation or traversal 
behaviors of customers but also purchasing behaviors of customers. Having traveling and 
purchasing information at the same time, managers can realize which pages/segments are preferred 
in the web site/supermarket and what the products they purchased then. Then, managers can move 
items/products to more suitable pages/segments. To overcome the disadvantages of current 
association rule mining and path traversal pattern mining techniques, Yun and Chen (2000) 
proposed the MTS algorithm by taking both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers 
into consideration. Later, Lee et al. (2003) proposed IPA (Integrating Web traversal patterns and 
Association rules) algorithm to solve disadvantage of MTS algorithm. IPA algorithm considers not 
only forward behavior, but also backward behavior. However, IPA algorithm can only consider 
customers buy one item in one web page, which might be not practical in many cases. Then, Lee et 
al. (2008) proposed WTP (Web transaction Patterns mining) algorithm to solve this problems. 
 
三、以顧客瀏覽樣式與採購關聯性為基礎之貨架指派方法  
The framework of the proposed method consists of three main stages. The framework of the 
purposed method is shown in Figure 1.  
8 
 
Figure 2 The layout of a supermarket 
 
When a customer traverses with a cart affixed with a RFID activate tag at its bottom and 
passes through the reading range of a RFID reader, the RFID system stores customer id (cid), the 
time (t), and reader id (rid) into the traversal-temp database. In the database, a path sequence for cid 
is represented as <(rid1, t1), (rid2, t2), …, (ridp, tp)> where ridpR and tp is the timestamp that cid is 
read by ridp. After the path collection process completes, the path sequences represented by readers 
will be transformed into traversal sequences represented by sections. That is, a path sequence <(rid1, 
t1), (rid2, t2), …, (ridp, tp)> where ridpR and tp is the timestamp will be transformed into a traversal 
sequence <w1, w2, …, wp> where wpS through the proposed transformation procedure.  
 
 
3.2 Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association of items  
 
3.2.1 Association rule generation  
The association rule mining is to discover the rules of the presence of one set of items implies 
the presence of another set of items from a given transaction database. Apriori algorithm, 
introduced by Agrawal et al. (1994), is one of the most popular methods for frequent pattern mining. 
Therefore, this research adopts Apriori algorithm to get item associations from transaction database. 
The input to the Apriori algorithm is transaction database and minimum support and the output is 
frequent itemsets Lk. In the algorithm, Lk denotes the set of all frequent k-itemset and Ck the set of 
candidate k-itemset. In the first phase, L1 is found from C1 and C1 can be generated by listing all 
distinct items in databases. Then, Apriori algorithm will sequentially scan the database can yield the 
minimum supports of all transactions in C1. Next, those infrequent itemset results in the large set L1 
will be removed. The kth phase is to produce Lk. Finally, if there are no more frequent itemset 
generated, the algorithm will stop and return Lk. 
In this research, only “single item to singe item” rules are needed. Therefore, this research will 
stop at L2 in Apriori algorithm and then generate rules based on provided minimum confidence. All 
association rules then store in products association rule database (PS).  
 
10 
For each minor item, this research scans the association rules again and find out the major 
items related to the minor item. If the minor item can be arranged to the same section with these 
major items, then the cross sale probability for the minor item can be dramatically increased. If it is 
not possible, the minor item is put to the nearby sections according to the purchased sequence 
patterns. Based on the above concepts, it is clear that only minor items can be exchanged. Let CS be 
the set of sections included minor items. In the other words, each candidate section in CS represents 
the section where minor items can be arranged to. 
The minor items are expected to be reassigned to the shelves with higher product subcategory 
similarity with itself. Therefore, this research assumed that the products in the market should belong 
to the same product category in order to prevent assigning product item to unsuitable shelves. 
However, the product category can be divided into several product subcategories. Each item will 
belong to a product subcategory.  
 
3.3.3 Product Assignment 
After that, this research will try to reassign products to most suitable shelves. That is, the 
objective function of this research is defined as

where jhv  stands for average weighted-movement if minor item j is placed on the shelf where 
minor item h displayed. J is total number of minor items. Let jhE  = 1 if minor item j is assigned to 
the shelf where minor item h displayed, otherwise jhE  = 0.  
 
四、研究成果  
4.1 Simulation study description  
This research simulates a set of customer’s purchase data to show how our model works in an 
implementation environment and analyze the performance. Figure 3 (a) shows the supermarket 
layout of this simulation study. In this supermarket, there are 52 shelves, which is identified from z1 
to z52. Also, the supermarket is divided into 43 sections, which is identified from s1 to s43. Besides, 
customers can only enter the market by one entrance, but they can leave by multiple sections, 
including s27, s28, s29, s30, s34, s43. In the supermarket, all the products are related to food and are 
classified into 17 classes. Table 1 shows the list of products for each product class in the simulation 
study

After association rules and purchase patterns are generated, Table 2 is scanned to find major 
items. Then, the system is to find minor items. In this case, 9 major items including i5 (Raki), i52 
(Low-fat milk), i53 (Milk tea), i61 (Chicken stock), i72 (Hami melon), i74 (Tomato), i87 (Low-fat milk 
powder) and i95 (Pasta) are found. In addition, 8 minor items including i12(Rise the crisp cake), 
i21(Green tea), i33(Meat canned food), i48(Soda cracker), i81(Cereal), i89(Oatmeal), i98(Whole wheat 
noodle) and i104(Ketchup) are identified.  
The final phase of the proposed product reassignment model is to apply Hungarian method to 
obtain the best product deployment. The result after taking Hungarian method is shown in Table 3. 
 
Table 3 Result of new assignment

i104 z21 z16 
 
 In Table 3, it shows most of minor items are assigned to new shelves. That is, new shelves of 
minor items are not just affected by product class similarity only, but also section movement 
distance. The physical location of products after reassignment is shown in Figure 4. 
14 
the parameter settings.  
Our method determines major items and minor items before product reassignment. Instead of 
reassigning all of items in the store, this research reassigns minor items only. As mentioned, this 
research trends to rearrange products depend on information of product’s relationship and 
customer’s shopping path. If the whole store layout is changed, the strategy of product-to-shelf 
assignment will not be feasible and reliable, because most of customers won’t follow the discovered 
shopping paths when they travel in the new layout store.

1 對於產業方面 
在競爭激烈的零售業中，要將種類類繁多的產品陳列在有限的貨架空間上，對零售商而言
是一種十分重要且繁重的工作。不同的產品組合和貨架擺列方式，會直接影響到消費者的
目光、注意力、及購買時的決策，當然也就顯著地影響零售商的獲利。因此，如何將產品
項目分配到有限的貨架空間(貨架指派)，就成為零售業經營成功與否非常重要的關鍵。本
計畫的執行將有助於零售業者以非人工的方式，有系統地瞭解產品置放位置與獲利間的關
係，同時也協助零售業者以客戶的角度調整其貨架置放的位置。 
 
2 對於學術貢獻方面 
誠如在研究背景中所述，目前資料探勘技術已被廣泛應用於各領域中，協助決策者制定重
要政策，然而卻少有相關的研究將之應用於賣場貨架指派的問題。有鑑於對此一領域的探
索有其重要性與前瞻性，因此本計畫將提出一個「以顧客瀏覽樣式與採購關聯性為基礎之
貨架指派研究」，將針對以 RFID 為基礎之賣場，深入探討顧客購物路徑行為模式、採購商
品關聯性、與貨架擺放位置之關係，以彌補此一方面研究的不足。同時，在本計劃完成後
(或計劃中)，預計將可發表一到二篇的國際期刊，將研究成果與學術界先進分享。 
 
3 對於國家發展方面
