Abstract 
We present a new image-sharing 
method, based on reversible 
integer-to-integer (ITI) wavelets, which 
provides highly compact shadows for 
real time progressive transmission. In 
contrast to existing methods, our 
approach, working in the wavelet 
domain, processes the transform 
coefficients in each band, divides each 
of the resulting combination coefficient 
into m shadows and recovers the 
complete secret image using any r or 
more shadows (r ≤ m). We take 
advantages of properties of the 
reversible ITI multi-resolution 
representation, such as coefficient 
magnitude decay and excellent energy 
compaction, to design combination 
procedures for the transform coefficients 
and process sequences in wavelet 
decomposition bands such that compact 
shadows for real time progressive 
transmission are obtained.

transmission, Wavelet transform

1.前言與研究目的 
Recently, secret image sharing has 
For a detailed description of the 
proposed method the reader is referred 
to the published papers out of this 
project listed in the Self-Evaluation 
section. 
 
3. 結果與討論 
Four images (Lena, Jet, Monkey 
and Peppers) each has 512512×  pixels 
with 8 bits per pixel, were used in our 
experiment. The ITI wavelet derived 
from Daubechies’ 5/3 biorthogonal 
wavelet, 6 level decomposition, and the 
(r, m) threshold scheme with r=4 and 
m=6 were used. The smaller size 
compact shadows produced by our 
method (Proposed) are shown in Table 1 
in comparison to those obtained by 
Thien and Lin’s (TL’s) method. The real 
time progressive transmission and 
reconstruction performance using four 
of the six shadows with different 
percentages of shadow coefficients from 
these four shadows is shown in Table 2. 
Note that using whole shadow 
coefficients from these four shadows 
results in lossless (L.L.) reconstruction. 
The performance of our method on Lena 
image is shown in Figures 1 and 2.  
Figure 1(a) shows the ITI wavelet 
transform of Lena image. The share 
phase applied to the combination 
numbers gave the result shown in Figure 
1(b) with blank lower part showing the 
size reduction after the coefficient 
combination process. In Figure 1(c), six 
shadows were obtained. The secret 
image was revealed in real time 
progressively using four of the six 
shadows with different percentages of 
coefficients as shown in Figure 2.
