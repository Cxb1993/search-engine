1、 中文摘要 
本研究提出一個以切割法為基礎，最
佳化最大電壓降的元件擺置方法。我們於
元件擺置階段除了考量晶片的總線長外，
同時也考量標準元件的排列與電壓降效應
的關係，將功率消耗大的元件往 row 的兩
側搬動，功率消耗小的元件往 row 的中央
搬動，減少了晶片電壓降值。當元件擺置
結束後，我們從電壓降最嚴重的 row 上搬
動標準元件至其他的 row，減少晶片上最
嚴重的電壓降值。相對於 WL-Driven 
Placement，本演算法能夠減少 51％之最
大電壓降值。藉由我們提出的元件擺置方
法，除了可以於元件擺置階段估計電壓降
值並且降低電壓降效應，也可以減少利用
Power Straps 以求降低電壓降效應，節省
繞線。 
 
關鍵字：電壓降、電源分佈網路、 
電流漂移、元件擺置 
 
Abstract 
In this study, a partition-based IR drop-
driven standard cell placement algorithm is 
proposed. We consider the location of the 
standard cells relative to the power source to 
reduce the IR drop during placement. After 
that, we consider the total wire length of the 
chip and move standard cells from the row 
with maximum IR drop to a new location 
such that the maximum IR drop is reduced. 
Placement generated by the proposed 
approach is compared with the WL-Driven 
placement. On average, the proposed 
approach improves the maximum IR drop 
value by 51%. Besides, it can reduce the 
need of adding the power straps on the chip 
by using our approach.

2、 緣由與目的 
 
    由於設計日趨複雜，晶片中電晶體個
數急遽成長使得電壓降（IR drop）的問題
越來越嚴重。所謂的電壓降是由於進入了
深次微米製程（DSM）後，金屬線的寬度
越來越細，導線的電阻值變大，造成電壓
降增加，使得電源供給 CMOS 元件的電
壓減小，削弱了元件驅動（driving）的能
力，這將造成元件運作速度變慢，並且減
小了元件對抗雜訊的忍耐能力。而當電路
的電壓降很嚴重時，電路會因為延遲時間
的變長，而無法達到設計者（designer）
的要求，更嚴重者將會發生 setup time 及
hold time 問題，使得功能（function）發
生錯誤，一般而言 5％電壓降將會造成 15
％以上的延遲時間[1]，所以如何解決電壓
降是一個重要課題。 
    目前我們還未見過在元件擺置過程時
探討電壓降的文章，而多是於平面規劃
（Floorplan）時  [1][13]考量電壓降的問
題，至於在估計晶片電壓降方面則有許多
種方法被提出[2][4][6][9][10]，如論文[10]
提 出 等 效 傳 導 性 模 型 （ equivalence 
conductance model）以及電壓控制電流源
模 型 （ voltage controlled current 
source）。S.H. Huang and C.L. Wang [13]
於 2001 年提出了等效電阻網路模型方
法，論文[10]輿論文[13]使用的相同的模
型(Model)計算節點電壓，模型為假設 row
的兩端都是電壓源，標準元件的等效電阻
以及 power rail 的等效電阻分佈在 row
裡，兩篇論文的不同之處在於計算節點電
壓的方式不相同，論文[10]先計算流經每
行政院國家科學委員會專題研究計畫成果報告 
電壓降導向之基礎元件配置方法研究 
Voltage Drop Driven Standard Cell Placement

主持人：陳美麗教授  中原大學資訊工程系 
擺置在同一個 row 上，則在此 row 上亦會
產生較高的電壓降。 
根據以上兩點觀察結果，我們提出一
個以分割法為基礎的電壓降導向元件擺置
方法。此演算法包含 Global Placement、
Detail Placement 及 Greedy IR Drop 
Refinement 三個階段，以下我們分別描述
此三個階段的內容。 
 
z Global Placement 
在此階段我們重複執行 Vertical Cut 
Partition 及 Horizontal Cut Partition 將電路
切割成水平或垂直的兩個 partitions，直到
每個 partition 中的元件個數小於 20 個。 
 
1. Vertical Cut Partition：  
Vertical Cut Partition 是將一個區域分
割為左、右兩個子分割區塊。首先我
們是計算所有元件位於目前所在區域
中心點時的功率消耗，並且依功率消
耗值由大到小排序，在符合 area 
constraint 的條件下，把功率消耗大
的標準元件搬到離電壓源近的區域，
功率小的標準元件搬到離電壓源遠的
區域。即完成 initial partition。 
接著我們應用模擬退火法來改進
initial partition 的結果。在模擬退火
法的改進程序中，我們不僅要改善晶
片的電壓降，對於 Wire Length 也需
要以與考慮。以下為模擬退火法之成
本函數。 
 
Costv = αv * Σn∈Net (Wn * WLn)  
+ βv * Σi∈Cells ( Di * Pi )    (2) 
 
其中 αv、βv 為使用者自訂的參數。用
來調整兩個不同 cost 之間的權重。
Wn 為 net n 的權重，我們可以給與每
條 net 不同的權重，來達到其最佳化
的目標。WLn 為 net n 的線長，在此
我們是使用 net 的 bounded box 的半
周長來估計 net 的線長。Pi 為 cell Ci
的功率消耗，Di代表 cell Ci 和電壓源
之間的最短距離，Di 的計算方式如
Fig 2 所示：假設目前要切割 Region 
G（Fig 2 中灰色的區域）中的標準元
件，若 Cell A 被分配到右邊的 sub-
Region 則將會計算右邊 sub-Region
的中心位置到左右兩側的電壓源的距
離，距離分別是 DL 和 DR，則由於
DL 大於 DR，所以我們此處的 Di 便設
定為 DR。 
 
2. Horizontal Cut Partition 
Horizontal Cut Partition 是將一個區域
分割為上、下兩個子分割區塊。首先
對所有的元件，我們利用 Force-
directed 方式，將每個元件搬動至與
此元件相連的所有元件的重心位置，
即力平衡的位置。我們重覆搬動每一
個元件，直到所有元件均位在力平衡
的位置上。接著我們將所有元件搬到
最接近的子區域中，即完成 initial 
partition。 
我們同樣應用模擬退火法來改進
initial partition 的結果。由於我們假
設所有的 row 的方向皆為水平方向，
因此執行 Horizontal Cut Partition 時為
了避免功率消耗大的標準元件過於集
中於某一個切割區域中，因此除了最
佳化總線長外，也要最小化兩切割區
域的功率消耗差值。以下為模擬退火
法之成本函數。 
 
Costh = αh * Σn∈Net (Wn * WLn)  
+ βh * DeltaPower      (3) 
 
其中 αh、βh 使用者自訂的參數。用來
調整兩個不同 cost 之間的權重。Wn
為 net n 的權重，WLn 為 net n 的線
長。DeltaPower 為兩個子區域的功率
消耗差值，計算公式如下： 
Fig 2. 標準元件和電壓源的距離範
Cell A
Region G
DL DR
元件擺置階段時就考量電壓降效應，相對
於 WL-Driven Placement，經由本演算法
所擺置的電路平均能夠減少 51％的最大
電壓降值。由於電壓降值的降低，可以減
少所需的 power straps，可減少所需的空
間成本。 
對於未來更複雜、要求更快的時序及
低功率消耗的設計，電壓降效應會越來越
明顯，使得我們無法避免解決電壓降效
應，並正視電壓降所帶來的問題。

ABSTRACT
A partition-based IR drop-driven algorithm is proposed for
standard cell placement. Different cost functions for reducing IR
drop are used in the horizontal cut and vertical cut partitioning
processes. In addition to minimizing the total wire length, we
balance the power consumption of the two partitions during the
horizontal cut partitioning process. During the vertical cut
partitioning process, we move the cells with higher power
consumption closer to the power sources to reduce the maximum
IR drop of the row. After placement is finished, we apply a greedy
placement refinement process to further reduce the value of the
maximum IR drop. Each standard cell row is modeled with an
equivalent conductance model. Then the IR drop of each row is
calculated and analyzed. We compare the placement generated by
the proposed approach with the wire length-driven placement. On
average, the proposed approach improves the value of maximum
IR drop by 51%. Therefore, it reduces the need to add power straps
on the chip and more routing resources are saved.
1. INTRODUCTION
As the process technology improves, signal integrity problems will
become important issues. One of these problems is the IR drop
problem. Especially in the deep sub-micron era, the use of
narrower metal lines produces higher impedance and a more
serious IR drop. This excessive IR drop will decrease the driving
strength of CMOS devices. This effect will cause an increase in
cell delay and may cause the cross talk problem on the fan-out net.
As indicated by reference [1], a 5% IR drop will cause more than a
15% additional cell delay. As such, reducing the JR drop in a
circuit is an important issue in deep sub-micron designs.
In a SOC design, there are macros and millions of standard cells.
The power plan is designed at the chip level. In a standard cell
logic core, power lines connect to the ends of the rows. The IR
drop gets serious toward the middle of a row. Designers generally
add a power grid or power straps to solve this problem. If the cells
are placed without a voltage drop violation, then the designers do
not need to add extra power routing resources on top of the
standard cell rows. Many papers have discussed the IR drop
problem at the floorplan stage, such as references [1] and [7]. But
we did not find any paper which addressed the JR drop problem at
the placement stage. Many models for IR drop calculation have
been presented in the past [2]-[7]. Cho et al. [6] presented an
equivalent conductance model and a voltage controlled current
source model (VCCS) of a standard cell row. Huang et al. [7] used
the same equivalent conductance model as reference [6]. The
authors used the superposition principle to calculate the voltage of
nodes of the model with a shorter CPU time. Thus, we adapt the
method presented in paper [7] to calculate the voltage drop on a
standard cell row. This method is described in section 2.
We estimate the power consumption of each cell and place cells
with high power consumption closer to the power supply sources
to reduce IR drop during the placement process. A
bipartition-based placement framework is used. After the
placement is done, we build an equivalent conductance model for
each row. Then, the supply voltage of each cell is calculated.
Finally, a greedy maximum IR drop refinement process is
introduced to reduce the maximum JR drop of the chip.
The framework of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
contains the equivalent conductance model used in this work.
Section 3 describes how to calculate the IR drop of a standard cell
row. Section 4 describes the proposed algorithm. The experimental
results are described in section 5. Section 6 is the conclusion.
2. PRELIMINARY
In a standard cell logic core, cells are placed in rows, and the
power is fed to the power rail from the power lines located at the
ends of rows. The power network model of a row can be derived
by the equivalent conductance model. An equivalent conductance
model [7] is composed of the resistors extracted from the power
rail and the equivalent resistors of cells. We use an example to
illustrate the model.
Figure l(a) shows an example of the equivalent conductance
model of a row. Both ends of the row connect to a voltage source,
named VS1 and V32, respectively. Rp,...Rps represent the resistances
of the segments on the power rail. RC1...R4 represent the
equivalent resistances of the cells which connect nodes Ml...M4,
respectively. By using the superposition principle of a linear
network, the model of figure l(a) may be divided into two
independent models as shown in figures l(b) and (c). Figures l(b)
and (c) are the partial networks seen from V31 and V.2, respectively.
In the model of figure 1(b), the power is supplied by V1. We
assume that VM'....VM4, represent the voltages of the nodes
Ml'...M4'. REQ ....REQI4 are the equivalent resistances seen from
nodes Ml'...M4'. Thus, the voltages of these nodes Ml'...M4',
denoted as VMJ'...VM4', may be calculated through the following
equations,
REQ14 = Rc4I/Rps
REQI3 = Rc311(RP4+REQl4)
REQ12 = Rc2//(RP3+REQ13)
REQJ1 = RC //(RP2+REQl2)
VM1 = VS, * REQII/ (REQI1 +Rp1)
VM2'= VMI'* REQI2/(REQ12+RP2)
VM3'= VM2' *REQI3/(REQI3+RP3)
VM4'= VM3' * REQ14/(REQ14+RP4) (1)
Similarly, in the model of figure 1(c), the voltages of nodes
Ml"...M4W', denoted as VM1"... VM4-, may be solved by the
following equations,
REQ41 = Rc,//RP,
REQ42 = RC2/(RP2+REQ41)

4.2 IR Drop-Driven Global Placement
The global placement contains two major parts; the horizontal cut
partitioning process and the vertical cut partitioning process. These
two processes are executed recursively.
4.2.1 Horizontal Cut Partitioning
First, all cells are placed at the center of the partition region. Then,
the partition region is divided into two sub-regions. We apply the
force directed technique to perform the initial placement. The
external connections to the cells will pull the cells to the
appropriate sub-region. The total cell area in each sub-region is
within 45% to 55% of the total cell area.
After the initial placement, a simulated annealing based refinement
process is executed. The objective of this process is to minimize
the total wire length and to balance the power consumption of the
two partitions simultaneously. By balancing total power
consumption, we can avoid serious IR drop in one partition. The
cost function may be written as equation (7),
Costh = a4 * -neNet(WL) + f) * DeltaPower (7)
where WL4 represents the wire length of net n, and DeltaPower
represents the difference between the power consumptions of the
two partitions. DeltaPower may be calculated by equation (8),
DeltaPower = AiERegioni Pi - ;eRegio2 PJ | (8)
where Pi(PJ) represents the power consumption of cell CQ(Cj). The
value of Pi(P,) is calculated by equation (5). , and A, are the
weights of these two costs. After the simulated annealing
refinement process, we obtain two partitions with shorter total wire
length and more balanced power consumption.
4.2.2 Vertical Cut Partitioning
First, the position of each cell is assigned to the center of the
partition region which the cell belongs to. Then, we calculate the
power consumption of each cell. The first half of higher power
consumption cells are placed in the sub-region which is closest to
the power supply source. The rest of the cells are placed in the
other sub-regions. After initial placement, a simulated annealing
based refinement process is executed.
We would like to obtain a placement in which the higher power
cells are placed closer to the power supply source while
simultaneously considering the total wire length. The cost function
used is written as equation (9),
Costv = av *2MeNet (WLn) + A * 4,CeLes ( Pi * Di) (9)
where a% andA are the weighting factors. WLn represents the wire
length of net n. The second term of equation (9) is the total
weighted power consumption of all cells. Pi represents the power
consumption of a cell Ci. The weight term, denoted as Di,
represents the distance from the cell to the nearest power source.
The value of Di may be calculated through equation (10),
Di = Min (Db,DR) (10)
where DL and DR represent the distances from cell C, to the left and
right power sources. To minimize the second term of equation (9)
we will move the cells with higher power consumption closer to
the power supply sources. Therefore, the maximum JR drop on a
row will be reduced.
4.3 IR Drop-Driven Detail Placement
After the global placement is done, the core area of the design is
partitioned into many sub-regions. There are less than 20 cells in
each sub-region. For each partition region, we recursively perform
the horizontal cut partitioning process until each sub-region
contains only one row. Then, we recursively apply the vertical cut
partitioning process on each partition region until each sub-region
contains only one cell. Finally, all cells are placed on rows and the
overlaps between cells are removed.
4.4 The Greedy Maximum IR Drop Refimement
Process
First, we calculate the maximum IR drop of each row and locate
the row which has the highest maximum IR drop. Then, we move
the cell with the highest power consumption on the row to a target
row. We select a target row through the following sequence: (1)
The row with the lowest maximum IR drop. (2) The row that
overlaps with the center of gravity of the cells that connect to the
selected cell. (3) An adjacent row that has a lower maximum IR
drop value. If the maximum IR drop is reduced and the total wire
length is increased 1% or less after the cell move, then the
movement is accepted. The maximum IR drops of the rows are
updated and the cell move process is repeated. If all three of these
movements fail, then the cell is locked and the next unlocked cell
with the highest power consumption is picked for movement. This
refinement process is recursively executed until all cells on the row
with the maximum IR drop are locked.
5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The proposed algorithm is implemented in the C language. The
technology data in the TSMC .25um CMOS library were extracted
for this study. Four designs are used as test cases. Two of them,
Macl and Mac2 are among the ISPD 2001 Circuit Benchmarks [8].
The characteristics of the test cases are listed in table 1. Columns 2
and 3 show the number of cells and nets in the test cases. The
number ofrows is listed in column 4.

We compared the experimental results of the wire length-driven
placer and the proposed algorithm. During these experiments, the
supply voltage of the chip was 2.5V. The frequency was 500 MHz.
The experimental results are listed in table 2. Columns 2, 3, 4 and
5 show the results of the wire length-driven placement. The
maximum value of IR drops among all rows is listed in column 2
and the percentage of the values of maximum IR drop over the
supply voltage is shown in column 3. The standard deviation of the
maximum IR drops of all rows is listed in column 4. Column 5
shows the wire length of the placement. Columns 6 and 9 are the
relative values of the results of the proposed algorithm to columns
2, and 5 respectively. Column 7 shows the percentage of the value
of maximum IR drop over the supply voltage. Column 8 shows the
standard deviation of the maximum IR drops of all rows.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce
the maximum IR drop of the design effectively. As shown in table
2, on average the maximum IR drop is reduced 51% with a 5%
overhead on wire length. It shows that the proposed algorithm can
reduce the standard deviation of the maximum IR drop values of
all rows.
We assume that the maximum IR drop criterion is 5% of the supply
voltage. In CPU and Macl, we can produce placements which
satisfy the maximum IR drop constraint. In CPU_1_5 and Mac2,
although our algorithm can reduce the maximum values of IR drop,
the values sfill exceed the maximum IR drop criterion. Thus,
