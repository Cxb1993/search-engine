small molecules are particularly promising for 
molecularly imprinted polymers. Coffee and tea are 
the most common drinks in daily life. However, 
excessive caffeine intake can cause sleeplessness. 
Therefore, caffeine extraction by molecularly 
imprinted polymers has also been investigated in 
numerous studies. For example, inorganic molecularly 
imprinted polymer was synthesized with 
tetraethoxysilane and silane coupling agents to extract 
the caffeine.7 Some sensing approaches demonstrated 
by Alizadeh et al. used the MIP-carbon paste on the 
working electrode for electrochemical sensing.8 
Kobayashi et al. demonstrated molecular imprinting 
of caffeine on polyacrilonitrile (PAN) copolymers by 
quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM).9 The QCM 
transducer integration method is also used for 
imprinting on polymethacrylic acid.10 Conventional 
functional monomers and cross-linking agents have 
been used to synthesize MIPs, but problems such as 
slow processing time, instability and short electrode 
life have limited their use in home-care systems. For 
the integration of a electrochemical biosensor, the 
potentiostat is an indispensable transducer, because 
every sensor needs to maintain electrochemical 
stability in the sensor. Up to the present, two kinds of 
potentiostats have been developed: one is the 
commercial designed potentiostat for research in 
laboratory, and the other is the specific developed 
potentiostat for a particular sensor. As far as the 
potentiostat’s characteristic is concerned, the former is 
sophisticated, expensive, and non-portable, and the 
latter is simple, low-cost, and portable.  
Poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol), EVAL, has been 
used for filtration membranes and is commercially 
available with ethylene content of 27, 32, 38 or 44 
mole %. Methods of forming EVAL membranes 
include precipitation by solvent evaporation and 
wet-phase inversion.11-14 Given their high 
biocompatibility and easy manufacture, EVAL 
thin-film membranes should be very suitable for use 
as sensing materials in biosensors15-16. In this work, 
EVAL was employed as a sensing element in a process 
for forming synthetic receptors and then integrated on 
the electrode. A portable potentiostat with auto-range 
current-to-voltage converting function is proposed and 
realized by off-the-shelf circuit components. 
Commercial tea drinks were purchased and measured 
using the membrane-coated electrode with a low-cost 
portable electrochemical sensor. The same setup was 
used to measure interference analogues such as 
glucose to investigate the interaction between 
molecularly imprinted polymers and other 
biomolecules. 
 
2. Experimental Section 
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of 
Molecularly Imprinted Polymeric Thin Films 
Caffeine (I), (-)epigallocatechin gallate 
(EGCG) (II) and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol), 
EVAL, with ethylene 27, 32, 38 and 44 mol% were 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from 
Panreac (Barcelona, Spain) and used as the solvent to 
dissolve EVAL polymer particles at a concentration of 
12.5 wt%.

The synthesis of caffeine- and 
EGCG-imprinted and non-imprinted (NIP) EVAL thin 
film briefly included three steps (as shown in scheme 
1), (1) casting the EVAL solution (EVAL/DMSO=1.0 
wt%) mixed with and without 0.1 wt% of target 
molecules on a indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode 
(2x7cm2); (2) solvent evaporation in an oven at 60oC 
for 3 hours to completely remove DMSO; and then (3) 
removal of the template molecule by rinsing in 20 mL 
of ethanol for 30 mins and then deionized water for 10 
mins, repeated three times. All membranes were 
equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
overnight before use. 
The preliminary binding measurements of 
caffeine and EGCG molecules to the caffeine-, 
EGCE- or non-imprinted EVAL polymers were 
performed with 5 mL of 0.1 mg/mL target molecules 
(unless otherwise stated) for 30 mins. A UV/Vis 
spectrometer (Halo DB-20, Dynamica, Prahran East 
Victoria, Australia) was then employed to confirm 
that leeching/washout of template molecules was 
complete, as determined by absorbencies of caffeine 
and EGCG @ 280 nm. 
 
2.2 The Measurement of Tea Samples with the 
Potentiostat and Molecularly Imprinted Polymeric 
Electrodes 
The amperometric responses of the imprinted 
polymeric sensing electrodes were measured with the 
proposed potentiostat, using different concentrations 
of target molecules in PBS, and using a tea drink 
samples. The setup of the electrochemical reaction can 
 5 
response may correlate with imprinting effectiveness 
in a batch rebinding measurement, as Table 1 shows. 
Therefore, the imprinting effectiveness in Table 1 can 
be used to find the suitable ethylene composition of 
EVALs for subsequent imprinting from specific target 
molecules. The saturated EGCG concentrations for 
EGCG-imprinted and non-imprinted EVAL coated 
electrodes were approximately 0.5 and 0.1 g/mL, 
respectively. The calibration curves of 
molecularly-imprinted polymer-coated electrodes can 
then be used to measure actual samples. The EGCG 
and caffeine are always co-present in tea drinks. Sugar 
is also added to some commercial tea drinks, but the 
trend is to limit the additional sugar for health reasons. 
The inset in Figure 2 depicts the effect of glucose and 
either EGCG for caffeine sensing electrode or caffeine 
for EGCG sensing electrode. Electrochemical 
response reached as high as 113.42 A at 1 mg/mL of 
glucose to the caffeine-imprinted EVAL coated 
electrode. Electrochemical response for other 
mentioned interferences in this work were less than 
100 A in their general possible concentrations. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The combination of rapidly aging populations 
in developed countries and rapid economic growth in 
developing countries has drawn attention to dietary 
approaches to health care for elderly people and 
disease prevention. The use of labels to identify the 
compositions of food is an important health care issue. 
The intake of tea and coffee is increasing because 
caffeine can temporarily ward off drowsiness and 
restore alertness and because (-)epigallocatechin 
gallate (EGCG) has antioxidation properties. 
Molecular imprinting of caffeine and EGCG are 
demonstrated for measuring in tea with EVALs-coated 
electrodes and a low-cost portable electrochemical 
biosensing system. Although several important issues 
remain, especially measurements of pesticides in food, 
the proposed system may be able to be used for daily 
life monitoring after further integration of multiplexed 
sensing probes.

Introduction 
Biosensors using the mechanisms of electrochemical, optical, mass sensitive thermometric and 
magnetometric have been intensively investigated [1], and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) has been 
used as recognition elements in sensors reviewed in numerous articles [1-3]. A severe challenge for MIP 
sensors is detection in chemically diverse environments, such as biological fluids [4-7]. There are many 
biomarkers discovered in biological fluid, like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, serum and urine. Important 
biomarkers such as creatinine [4], urea, and albumin [8], urine contains non-protein nitrogen metabolites, 
carbohydrates [9], proteins and amino acids [10]; detection of analytes must be made amid this complex 
chemical background. 
The oxidative DNA damage is found that implicated in carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases, 
and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) is the metabolism byproduct when DNA damaged by oxidative 
stress. 8OHdG concentration in the rat cerebral cortex has been measured by using microdialysis sampling 
and capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection; high-performance liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry [11]; Recently, 8-OHdG is amperometric measured using dendrimer modified electrodes [12] 
and with the synergies of molecularly imprinted polymer and quartz crystal microbalance technique for the 
8OHdG sensing in plasma [13]. Several ELISA kits which use monoclonal antibody specific to 8OHdG are 
commercial available for measuring 8OHdG in urine, serum and DNA, but it may not suitable for a 
home-care system. 
In this work, the lower cost of 8-hydroxyguanine (8OHG) was imprinted on the EVAL by solvent 
evaporation for the recognition of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) in urine. Non-covalent of 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding between guanine (G) and 8-hydroxyguanine 
(8OHG) to different ethylene contents of EVAL were also compared. 8-Hydroxyguanine-imprinting polymer 
was then coated on working electrode to analyze epitope recognition of 8OHdG to 8OHG-MIP using a 
potentiostat-cyclic voltammetry. Moreover, the novel and low cost 8OHdG MIP electrode was prepared and 
could potentially be applied in daily life. 
Figure 2(a) shows the typical cyclic voltammetry of the molecularly imprinted polymeric electrode 
measured by a potentiostat; the current peak occurred when 0.35 V was applied. In contrast, the 
non-imprinted polymeric electrode exhibited much less change after adding 8-OHdG concentrations varying 
from 2~43 µg/mL. Figure 2(a) was re-plotted into Fig. 2(b) to depict the relationship between the target 
concentration and the current difference at the current peak compared with buffer alone.  
     
Figure 1. The imprinting effectiveness of (a) guanine (G) and (b) 8-Hydroxyguanine (8-OHG) on poly(ethylene 
vinyl-co-ethylene alcohol) (EVAL) films. The imprinting effectiveness was defined as the ratio of the adsorbed amount of template 
molecules on the imprinted polymer to that on the non-imprinted polymer of the same composition. 
 
monotonically increased from 206.0± 7.8 and 187.0± 3.6 µA to as high as 865.0± 2.2 and 342.0± 2.4 µA, 
respectively. 
   To investigate interference affecting electrochemical signaling, creatinine, urea and lysozyme were 
measured with an 8-OHG-imprinted electrode. The current signal from lysozyme was from -5 to -30 µA for 
concentrations in the 0.01~50.5 µg/mL range, which is the possible concentration range in urine. Creatinine 
(at physiologically relevant concentration, above ~ 1 mg/mL) can cause a smaller amperometric response 
compared with lysozyme and urea. The current reduction for creatinine, urea and lysozyeme are 
approximately 3.6, 10.1 and 15.7 µA, respectively. The reason for the reduction in response, however, is not 
clear for using EVAL as the imprinted materials.

一、參加會議經過 
本會議論文摘要必須被審查，大會審查程序特別慢，以致於預定機票與旅館作業被拖延。泰航只
有在 5/11或 5/13起飛，因此為了配合大會開會時間，選擇 5/11班機。但在 5/11時，希臘在首都雅典
有罷工活動，行前非常擔心班機有所變化或停飛，但是很幸運本行程並沒有受到影響。到達雅典後需
要搭乘飛機 KOS island，因為大會論文接收通知非常緩慢，外加到 KOS island 的非位少，以致於
5/12~13沒有買到機位，因此在雅典停留兩晚，到 5/14中午至到達開會地點—希臘科斯島(KOS island)。
5月 14~17日在的科斯國際會議中心 (Kos International Convention Centre (KICC)) )參加 IC-MAST - 
2011，因為 5/18~19 日泰航沒有班機從雅典回台北（一週只有四個班次），因此 5/18 先搭船至羅德島
停留一晚，5月 19日從羅德島搭機回到雅典機場，經曼谷再回桃園，再轉高鐵回到高雄。以下將對行
程做一說明： 
A. 5/11~5/12: 下午搭高鐵至桃園高鐵站，再搭 shuttle bus至桃園機場，搭乘泰航曼谷機場轉
機，5/12清晨 5點多到達希臘雅典機場，並搭地鐵到旅館。. 
B. 5/13 ：無機位至 KOS  island，至在雅典等候機位。 
C. 5/14 ：希臘科斯島(KOS island) 的科斯國際會議中心 (Kos International Convention Centre 
(KICC))參加會議，聽報告演講。 
D. 5/15（日）早上 invited speaker 演講（圖一）完後，下午參與大會舉辦遊覽之行程，晚上 8點
參與大會舉辦晚宴，如圖二所示。 
E. 5/16~17: 科斯國際會議中心 (Kos International Convention Centre (KICC)) 參加會議，聽報告演
講（如圖一）及本次發表會議海報論文如圖三所示，其他海報展示如圖四。 
F. 5/18~20：因買機票從KOS回到雅典，而且5/18~19泰航無飛機回台灣，因此先搭船至鄰近羅德島
停留一晚後，搭機回雅典，再搭乘泰航到曼谷轉機回桃園機場，轉高鐵回到高雄。
