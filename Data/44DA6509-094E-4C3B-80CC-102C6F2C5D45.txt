Part I: Poly(vinylamine) Stabilized Colloidal CdS Quantum Dots of Color-
Tunable Photoluminescence: Synthesis and Optical Properties  
 
Sheng-Shu Hou* (侯聖澍) and Kai-Ming Chen (陳凱民) 
Abstract 
In this research, poly(vinylamine) (PVAm) was synthesized and employed as a soft template in 
the preparation of colloidal CdS QDs.  The colloidal CdS QD solutions were prepared with 
PVAm as the stabilizing polymer in the mixed solvent composed of methanol and water.  The 
emitting colors of the prepared CdS QD colloids are tunable either by varying the ratio of 
methanol/water or pH of the solvents.  The CdS QD colloids are colorless under UV light at 
extremely low pH and the low ratio of methanol to water.  The emitting color of the CdS QD 
colloids turn to yellow and orange as increasing methanol content and pH of the solvent.  At high 
pH or when the cosolvent is dominant in methanol the CdS QD colloids show bright to deep blue 
emission.  The optical properties of the CdS colloids have been systematically studied in terms of 
UV-vis and fluorescence spectrometry. 
 
Introduction 
Nanocrystalline semiconductor have been recognized asmaterials with potential in a wide 
range of technological applications.[1-3]  Typically for the 1-20 nm range most semiconducting 
materials such as the II/VI semiconductors show optical, magnetic, electronic, and mechanical 
properties greatly different from those of the corresponding bulk materials.[4]  To date, a variety 
of methods including reverse micelles,[5] orgnometallic chemistry,[6] and polymers.[7] has been 
studied extensively to prepare CdS nanocrystallites. 
Colloidal semiconducting nanoclusters, or quantum dots (QDs), have attracted much

Experimental Section 
Materials.  N-vinylformamide (NVF, Aldrich 98%) was distillated under reduced pressure at 
65°C prior to use. 2,2’-Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN, Aldrich 98%), sorbitan monostearate 
(Span 60, Fluka), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, Aldrich 98%), cadmium chloride (CdCl2·2.5H2O, 
Showa 98%), NaOH, HCl, and solvents were used as received. 
Preparation of Poly(vinylamine)·HCl (PVAm·HCl) and Hydrophobic Modified 
Poly(vinylamine) HCl (HMPVAm·HCl).  Poly (N-vinylformamide) (PNVF) was synthesized 
by the precipitation polymerization of NVF at 65°C, and AIBN was used as the initiator. Mn of 
PNVF = 76,000 and PDI = 2.61, which were determined by SEC.  The hydrolysis of PNVF was 
carried out in a 2 M NaOH solution at 70°C for 24 hours.  The hydrolyzed polymer was acidified 
with concentrated HCl to pH 2, and then was precipitated into methanol.  The resulting polymer, 
PVAm·HCl, dried at 60°C under vacuum for days.  The completeness of hydrolysis was verified 
by 1H-NMR (Figure 1).  Poly(vinylamine) (PVAm) was synthesized by the hydrolysis of PNVF. 
PVAm was dissolved in methanol containing 0.02-wt% NaOH and the alkyl halide (1- 
bromododecane) was slowly added at room temperature.[13]  The reaction was carried out at 
65°C for 48 hours.  The products (HMPVAm) was acidified with concentrated HCl and 
precipitated in the ethanol with pH of 2.  The degree of substitution was calculated by the peak 
integrals on the NMR spectra (Figure 1). 
Preparation of CdS colloids.  In a typical procedure, the polymer stock solution was prepared 
by dissolved 17 mg of PVAm_HCl in 6 mL of deioinzed water.  PVAm·HCl stock solution of 
3.55×10-3 M was prepared by diluting 1 mL of a high-concentraton solution into 10 mL with the 
required amount of water and methanol.  The 1.6×10-2 M stock solutions of CdCl2 and Na2S 
were prepared by diluting 1 mL solution of each concentrated solution that was prepared by 
dissolving 92 mg CdCl2·2.5H2O in 5 mL water and by dissolving 98 mg Na2S9·H2O in 5 mL

Results and Discussion 
Synthesis of PVAm Stabilized QDs 
The influence of the composition and pH of solutions on the optical properties of PVAm-
stabilized CdS QD colloids have been systematically studied.  Figure 2(a) and (b) present the 
photos of prepared colloidal CdS QD solutions under ambient light and UV (360 nm) irradiation, 
respectively.  The syntheses consisted in mixing PVAm·HCl (0.25 mg/mL) with CdCl2 (8×10-4 
M) followed by the addition of Na2S (8×10-4 M) in 10 mL of solvents, which had various 
compositions and pH values.  The samples prepared in the study are denoted as like CdS-5-0.8, 
the first value is the initial pH of the solvent and the second the volume fraction of methanol in 
the solvent.  Because PVAm·HCl could not be dissolveed in neat methanol as pH lower than 7, 
the in neat methanol the CdS colloids could only be prepare at pH = 7, 9, and 11.

polymer chains can be regarded as “nanoreactors”, in which Cd2+ ions react with S2- to give CdS 
QDs and then stabilized by the amino groups.  At low pH and methanol content, the protonated 
polymer chains are fully extended; thus, under this condition the growth of QD particles cannot 
be controlled and stabilized.  This is why the size of prepared colloidal QDs at low pH and low 
methanol content were larger, and precipitated significantly after settling.

QDs at various solutions, which correspond to Figure 4 (A) to (D).  The photoluminescence of 
colloidal CdS QDs varies with the change of cosolvent compositions.  At pH = 3 (Figure 5(A)), 
the CdS QDs prepard in the solution with high methanol content (fM = 0.8) exhibits extremely 
high intensity of emission.  It has been known that by addition of methanol the emission of 
colloidal CdS can be strongly enhanced. [16] 
At high pH, the surface of CdS QDs is covered with cadmium hydroxide, which is binding 
to sulfur anions. This mechanism may remove the non-radiative recombination centers composed 
of sulfur anions and increases the intensity of the emission light. Besides, the smaller sizes of 
CdS QDs lead to higher band energy.  For this reason, the blue-shift of emission peak is 
observed at high pH.  The trends can be seen by comparing Figure 5 (B), (C), and (D).

also observed in Figure 7(B) and (C).  These results indicate that variation of HMPVAm 
conformation is similar to that of  PVAm in the aqueous solution.  But the conformation model 
of HMPVAm is different with PVAm in the solution.  Because of the addition of hydrophobic 
chains, the HMPVAm can form micellar-like structures in the aqueous solution.  Although the 
properties of the CdS QDs are independent of the micellar-like structures, they would influence 
the aggregation behavior of produced CdS QDs.  These differences between PVAm and 
HMPVAm will be showen in the TEM photos. 
 
TEM images of the polymer-stabilized CdS QDs 
Figure 8 shows the TEM photos of the colloidal CdS QDs prepared from different synthetic 
conditions.  Figure 9 are the TEM photos of HMPVAm system.  Figure 8 (A) is 2-0.6 condition, 
the obvious aggregations are at this reaction condition and it’s owing to the low steric hindrance 
in the pH = 2.  As increasing the pH value, the PVAm will become more compact than those at 
low pH value so the steric hindrance can be improved to avoid the aggregation formation. Figure 
8 (B) and (C) are the TEM photos at 7-0 and 7-0.6 conditions.  The sizes of aggregation in these 
two conditions are smaller than these in 2-0.6. Besides, the distribution of particle sizes is more 
uniform.  Degree of protonation decreases as pH increasing so the polymer chain can form closer 
coils at pH of 7. At pH = 11 (Figure 8 (D) and (E)), almost no aggregation of CdS QDs is

Introduction. 
In the past two decades, the nanoparticle research has become the popular field in 
chemistry, physic, and some application.  The QDs has unique properties duo to the quantum 
confinement effect and the high ratio of surface-volume, so the properties of the QDs are 
different with the bulk-type material.  For the semiconductor QDs, the optical properties depend 
on the size.  The size of the QDs is so small that the surface properties influence the 
photoluminescent intensity.  The CdSe QDs has been studied intensively among various kinds of 
II-VI and III-V semiconductor nanoparticle. 
The method adopted for synthesizing CdSe nanoparticle usually uses the organometallic 
molecular as the precursors, which may decompose to aggregate the QDs at high temperature.1  
The CdSe QDs, which are prepared by this method, have size-tunable and narrow bandwidth 
emission, so the CdSe QDs can be used as the fluorescent biological labels in the living cell 
system.  However, for such purpose the surface of the CdSe QDs must be modified first with 
hydrophilic group.  Because TOPO is a non-polar molecular, the CdSe nanoparticle cannot be 
dissolved or dispersed well in the aqueous solution.  With the help of ligand exchange, the TOPO 
on the surface can be removed; therefore, the QDs is stabilized with a new hydrophilic molecular 
in the aqueous solution. 
The CdSe QDs, which are directly synthesized in the aqueous solution, have the advantages 
for the reasons of convenience, cost-down, and less-toxicity.  Recently, some studies reported 
several Se sources for synthsing CdSe QDs in the aqueous-phase synthesis at low temperature;  
for instance, Na2SeSO3,2 N,N-dimethylselenourea,3 and H2Se (or NaHSe)4,5.  Unfortunately, the 
CdSe QDs prepared by these methods have weak PL emission intensity.  However, the PL 
intensity of CdSe QDs could be enhanced up to 100 times after exposed to ambient light,.3,4

11.86 mg and 20 mg, respectively under the same condition. And the H2Se gas was passed 
through the N2-saturated NaOH aqueous solution (pH 11.7) for several hours.  For two routes, 
the molar ratio of PVAm⋅HCl / Cd/ Se was 10/ 2/ 1.5. 
Characterization.  UV-Vis absorbance spectra of colloidal CdSe naoparticle was recorded on a 
spectrophotometer (UV-160A, SHIMADZU, Japan).  The PL spectra were acquired by a 
fluorescence spectrometer (F2500, HITACHI, Japan) with a xenon lamp source.  The excitation 
wavelength was 365 nm, and the excitation and emission slit widths were both set at 10 nm. The 
concentration of the CdSe naoparticle was diluted 5 times for UV-VIS spectra, and the sample 
for PL spectra was maintained the orient concentration.  The size of CdSe nanoparticle was 
directly observed by transmission electron microscopy (H-7500, HITACHI, Japan).

The UV-VIS spectra (Figure 3) of the CdSe QDs by purging the H2Se showed that the 
onset of the absorbance red-shift with the initial pH decreasing.  But that has a critical 
wavelength range at 560 ~ 580 nm.  For the QDs synthesized at the initial pH 8, there were some 
red precipitates in the solution after the reaction finished.  Because the pH of the solution was 
decreasing as the H2Se gas was continually transferring to the Cd2+-PVAm solution.  For the 
amine group on the polymer chain, the ability to stabilize the QDs growth decreased.  The size of 
the QDs increased, even the red precipitate was found in the solution.  Figure 4 shows the PL 
spectra of the CdSe nanoparticle synthesized with H2Se.  The PL intensity decreased at low pH, 
and the wavelength of the max intensity was red-shift with the size of the nanoparticles grew 
 24
synthesized by NaHSe. The different effect was caused by the surface defect on the CdSe QDs.  
As injected the NaHSe solution rapidly into the Cd2+-PVAm solution, the concentration of the 
CdSe nucleation was saturated and the CdSe nanoparticle was generated quickly.  The rate of the 
growth of the CdSe QDs was so fast that the large amount of the defect was produced.  
Consequently, the intensity of the PL emission was weak or non-radiated.  However, the 
intensity of the CdSe synthesized by H2Se was stronger.  Because the H2Se was slowly 
transferred into the Cd2+-PVAm, the CdSe QDs slowly grew.  The accumulation of crystal was 
more regular, so the amount of the defect on the QDs decreased.  Accordingly, the intensity of 
the PL emission was advanced. 
 
The photoactivation of CdSe nanoparticle in the PVAm⋅HCl solution.  The fresh samples, 
which were synthesized by two routes, had the weak PL intensity.  There were some factors 
influencing the PL emission, for instant, the defects of the QDs, the surface properties of the 
QDs, and the cluster type QDs.  From the contributions of these factors, the energy of the 
recombination of the exciton would released by shallow-trap emission, deep-trap emission, or 
nonradioactive recombination.  But from previous reports, we found the photoactivation that 
could increase the PL intensity of CdSe QDs which synthesized in aqueous solution.  
The fresh made CdSe QDs solution was irradiated with ambient light at room temperature 
for 3 months.  After some days, there were some red precipitates on the bottom, and red 
precipitates had no emission under the UV-Lamp (λex=365 nm).  Remove the red precipitate and 
take the upper optical clear solution to measure the PL intensity.  Figure 5 shows the Temporal 
of PL spectra of CdSe nanoparticle synthesized by adding NaHSe at different pH.  The peaks of 
the maxima intensity were shift to short wavelength, the intensity increased to several folds after 
the photoactivation.  The photoactivation for the CdSe QDs is to shrink the surface defects of the 
QDs.  The defects on the surface have higher reactivity, so that free oxygen in the solution

Conclusion.  The CdSe QDs was synthesized in the aqueous phase with the PVAm⋅HCl as the 
soft template.  The size of the CdSe QDs could be controlled by vary pH of the Cd2+-PVAm 
stock solution.  After the photoactivation, the wavelength of the PL was blue-shift, and the PL 
intensity increases dramatically.  The ability of the PVAm that bestrews the CdSe influenced the 
degree of the photoactivation.  This water-soluble CdSe QDs has more potential to apply in 
biological and other application.

Introduction 
Submicrometer-sized monodisperse polymer particles with functional surface 
are of great interest in the filed of emulsion polymerization. In this work, a novel 
surfactant-free emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 
N-vinylformamide (NVF) has been developed. The synthesized particles are 
monodispersed and their size ranges from ca. 150 nm to 500 nm, depending on the 
initiator concentration, monomer feed ratio and monomer concentration. Additionally, 
the monomer feed ratio significantly influences the nucleation mechanism during the 
polymerization. 
Results and Discussion 
The surface and bulk compositions of 
the copolymer particles are probed in terms 
of XPS and 1H NMR, respectively. 
Generally, the NVF mole fraction is higher 
at the particle surface than inside the particle 
(see Table 1). For the particles prepared 
from the feed molar ratio MMA/NVF = 
13.5/1, MMA/NVF for whole particle is 
16.0/1. However, at the particle surface 
MMA/NVF is 6.8/1, which is two times of 
the feed ratio. In the case of feed ratio 
MMA/NVF = 1.7/1, the MMA/NVF ratio at 
the surface (2.13) and in the bulk (2.42) is about the same. For the MN9.5/0.5 sample, 
the depth-resolved XPS reveals that the MMA/NVF ratio turns into being invariable 
at the depth deeper than about 5 nm beneath the particle surface (see Figure 1). This 
indicates that micellar-like nucleation is dominated in the interval of particle 
nucleation. On the other hand, when the feed molar ratio (MMA/NVF) is 1.7/1, the 
mechanism of particle nucleation is mainly through the process of homogeneous 
nucleation.
