Abstract
This project constructs a high efficient genetic algorithm (GA), named IGA with SA mutation, by
including a fractional factorial design for the crossover operator and simulated annealing (SA) for
the mutation operator. Namely, in the proposed intelligent genetic algorithm, the chromosomes of
children are generated via an intelligent crossover process with factorial experiments. The GA with
the intelligent crossover operator is named intelligent GA (IGA). In this study, the simulated anneal-
ing mutation is used to replace the traditional jump mutation for improving the searching process
and avoiding individuals trapped into local optima. A nonlinear multimodal function with two de-
sign variables is computed to access the performance of the proposed GA. Moreover, four represen-
tative test cases, including Sphere, Rosenbrock, Rastrigin and Griewank functions, are performed
via the IGA with SA mutation, micro-IGA and IGA with jump mutation to evaluate the capacity and
efficiency of the proposed GA for large size of design variables. The computational solutions of the
convergence history and optimal objective function for the benchmarking cases demonstrate that the
proposed IGA with SA mutation outperforms the others IGAs. Two profile fittings of NACA 4415
and LS(1)-0417 Mod. airfoils are also performed via the proposed IGA with SA mutation. Further,
the presented high efficient GA is applied to the long-endurance airfoil optimization design.

IGA is applied to the shape fitting of airfoil and
long-endurance airfoil optimization design.

2.2 Intelligent Crossover Operator
After completing the tournament selection
operator [11], this study applies FFD, rather than
one-point, multi-point, or uniform crossover to
implement the crossover operator. The basic
FFD used in this work is based on classical fac-
torial analysis with two-level, multi-variable or-
thogonal tables [13]. Applying the fractional
factorial analysis to the crossover operator
yields an arrangement of two-level factors that
corresponds to the levels of the design variables
of selected parents. In the classical factorial ex-
periments, the two levels are labeled by “-”and
“+”.Hence, ix and ix represent the two lev-
els of the design variable ix in this work. That
is, ix is the level value of parent 1, while

ix
is the level value of parent 2. Table 1 lists the
level distribution of seven factors A, B, … and
ABC, each comprising two levels [13]. The ta-
ble shows that the experiment retains the bal-
ance of a Western experiment design. Each col-
umn has the same amount of levels “-”and “+”.
The numerical procedure steps for the fractional
factorial analysis are as follows:
1) First, if dimN factors (named by design
variables in the GA) each have two levels, then
build a table containing m rows and 1m
columns. The value m is defined using the in-
teger )]1([log dim22 N . For example, if seven factors
( dimN =7) are associated with vector x
, then
eight experiments ( m=8) are conducted for fac-
torial analysis. Table 1(a) shows that levels “-”
and “+”in columns A, B and C are assigned to
each cell position regularly based on the classi-
cal full factorial design principle. In columns
AB, AC, BC and ABC, each cell level is deter-
mined via the inner products of columns A and
B, A and C, B and C, and A, B and C. The first
experiment has one factor set to
x {  7654321 ,,,,,, xxxxxxx }, which is obtained
by combining the factors A to ABC with the as-
signed levels.
2) The function value 1f is computed and

where kx denotes the change of vectors px

the random function ()rand is between zero

is a discontinuous function that equals zero for
negative inputs, and otherwise is unity.

From the 3-D diagram displayed in Fig.1, Eq.
(7) is a multimodal function with numerous
local optima, and a unique global maximum
equal to one at the position ),( 21 xx =(0.06683,
0.06683). For solving the function optimization,
two sizes of population are used in the GA. One
is 6, and the other is 10. Figures 2(a)-(b) show
the convergence histories and optimal solutions
obtained by the three IGA methods using
popsizeN =6 and 10, respectively. Figure 2(a)
displays that the present IGA with SA mutation
has excellent convergence rate and global
maximum even using small population size. It is
capable of finding the global optimum rapidly
within 50 generations, while the micro-IGA and
IGA with classical jump mutation perform
relatively poor. Increasing the population size to
10, the result shown in Fig. 2(b) also
demonstrates that the presented IGA with SA
mutation is the best in terms of convergence rate
and global solution during 300 generations.

both airfoil thickness and camber. Using the
proposed IGA with SA mutation to achieve the
fitting curves, the designed airfoil shape for the
NACA 4415 and LS(1)-0417 Mod. airfoils are
presented in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). In these two
figures, circle symbols represent the target air-
foil coordinates. The computational results show
a good fit on the airfoil profiles using the pre-
sented IGA with SA mutation.

9The second case of designing the airfoil is de-
fining at high-lift design point ( 0.1lc ) to in-
vestigate the aerodynamic characteristics of the
designed airfoil at high-altitude, long-endurance
cruise. In this optimization design, LS(1)-0417
airfoil is chosen as the baseline airfoil. The de-
sign point is specified at the angle of attack
6 with lift coefficient 1.1lc when the
flow conditions for the Mach and Reynolds
number are equal to 0.15 and 6100.4  . Figure 9
shows the comparison of shapes between the de-
signed and LS(1)-0417 airfoil. Clearly, the de-
signed airfoil leads to an increase for the camber
along 10-70% chord. Figure 10 displays the
pressure distributions of the designed and origi-
nal airfoils. The computational and experimental
results of pressure distribution and aerodynamic
data clearly agree with one another for the origi-
nal LS(1)-0417 airfoil. The evaluated aerody-
namic data for the LS(1)-0417 airfoil are
125.1lc , 0150.0dc , 1071.0mc . Based on
the presented IGA with SA mutation optimizer
and the flow solver, the aerodynamic data for the
designed airfoil are evaluated to be 134.1lc ,
0119.0dc , 1004.0mc . Consequently, the
increase of the endurance factor reaches 27.56%
(from 79.5495 up to 101.478). The value of the
pitch-down coefficient slightly decreased. The
ratio of lift to drag improves from 75.0 to 95.29,
and could resulting in an enhancement in aero-
dynamic performance at long-endurance cruise.

IV Conclusions
The work constructed a high efficient genetic
algorithm, which incorporated a fractional facto-
rial crossover and simulated annealing mutation,
for solving global optimization problems. In-
cluding the fractional factorial design in the
crossover operator, termed intelligent crossover,
the best genes for children was intelligently de-
termined by the mating of a pair of parents.
Therefore, the proposed intelligent crossover
operation effectively enhances the evolutionary
efficiency of the traditional GA. Moreover, this
work also introduced the simulated annealing
mutation to replace the jump mutation, i.e. flip
bit, to enhance the searching process to avoiding
individuals trapped into the local optima. In this
paper, the traditional GA and micro-GA are up-
graded to IGA by using the intelligent crossover
operator. Therefore, this work developed the
proposed IGA with SA mutation, micro-IGA,
and IGA with jump mutation. Several test cases,
including a nonlinear multimodal function and
four benchmarking functions, such as the Sphere,
Rosenbrock, Rastrigin and Griewank functions,
are performed via the proposed IGA to evaluate
the algorithmic capacity and efficiency. The re-
sults shown the proposed IGA with SA mutation
outperformed the micro-IGA and IGA with
jump mutation. Moreover, two profile fittings of
